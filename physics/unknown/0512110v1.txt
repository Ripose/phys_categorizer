Abstract:  Special  relativity  theory  is  well  established  and  confirmed  by  experiments.  This 
research establishes an operational measurement way to express the great theory in a geometrical 
form.  This  may  be  valuable  for  understanding  the  underlying  concepts  of  relativity  theory.  In 
four-dimensional  spacetime  continuum,  the  displacement  field  of  matter  motion  is  measurable 
quantities.  Based  on  these  measurements,  a  finite  geometrical  field  can  be  established.  On  this 
sense, the matter motion in physics is viewed as the deformation of spacetime continuum. Suppose 
the  spacetime  continuum  is  isotropic,  based  on  the  least  action  principle,  the  general  motion 
equations  can  be  established.  In  this  part,  Newton  motion  and  special  relativity  are  discussed. 
Based on the finite geometrical field theory of matter motion, the Newton motion equation and the 
special  relativity  can  be  derived  simply  based  on  the  isotropy  of  spacetime  continuum  and  the 
definition  of  inertial  system.  This  research  shows  that  the  Lorentz  transformation  is  required  by 
both of the inertial system definition and the time gauge invariance for inertial systems. Hence, the 
special  relativity  is  the  logic  conclusion  of  time  invariance  in  inertial  system.  The  source 
independent  of  light  velocity  supports  the  isotropy  of  inertial  system  rather  than  the  concept  of 
proper time, which not only causes many paradox, such as the twin-paradox, but also causes many 
misunderstanding  and  controversial  arguments.  The  singularity  of  Lorentz  transformation  is 
removed in other parts of finite geometrical field theory, where the gravity field, electromagnetic 
field, and quantum field will be discussed with the time displacement field.

1. Introduction 

Newton  mechanics  and  special  relativity  theory  is  well  established  and  confirmed  by 
experiments. What is their intrinsic relation? There are huge papers on the special relativity theory 
and  its  relationship  with  Newton  mechanics.  Howerver,  the  ruler  and  clock  in  Einstein’s  theory 
cause many contraversial arguments about the time concept and the phisical intrinsic maening of 
Lorentz  transformation.  The  aparant  shortage  of  Minkowski  spacetime  is  the  negativity  of  time 
gauge  (or  space  gauge).  However,  the  Minkowski  spacetime  has  been  accepted  as  the  bases  for 
many  researches.  This  is  a  fact.  But  this  fact  cannot  be  used  to  prove  that  the  Minkowski 
spacetime  is  the  unique  solution  for  Lorentz  transformation.  This  paper  will  show  that  there  is 
another way to introduce the Lorentz transformation in a natural way following the traditional way 
of  inertial  system.  Although  the  treatment  expressed  in  this  paper  is  very  traditional  in  the 
operational sense of measurements, the concept of general relativity is fully accepted. 

In  this  research,  the  space  gauge  and  time  gauge  are  viewd  as  the  basic  feature  of  matter 
motion. The Riemann geometry in four-dimenssional spacetime is adapted as the basic geometry

of matter motion. There are many reasons for this view-point. It is believed that for typical matter 
motion there is no need to introduce too complicated geometrical structures, as the basic problems 
are well solved by simple geometry in each branch of physics. 

This research will not review the related researches as there are many excelent review articles 
available.  The  puppse  of  this  research  is  to  establish  the  intrinsic  form  of  matter  motion  by 
operational measurement geometrical method. The physical laws are derived from the least action 
principle proposed by Einstein and the inertial definition established by Newton. Of cource, some 
ad  hoc  principles  must  be  adapted.  The  research  exposes  the  intrinsic  relation  among  basic 
physical  laws  rather  than  inventing  some  laws.  The  research  focus  on  reformulating  the  basic 
physical  laws  in  an  operational  way  which,  the  author  believes,  will  make  it  be  easy  for  one  to 
understand the complecated physical world in tradition-like way. 

For  matter  motion,  the  basic  operational  measurements  are  the  geometrical  variation  of 
spacetime continuum. Hence, an intrinsic geometrical structure should be established firstly (this 
believe is contradict with the concepts of looking the underlying geometrical structures for known 
physical  motion  laws).  Secondly,  the  underlying  physical  laws  are  established  to  describe  the 
cause of geometrical variation and their intrinsic relationship. This forms the basic believe of the 
whole research, which will be expalined by three basic papers of the research. 

In this research, the first principle is the isotropy of spacetime (the isotropy of inertial mass is 
implied  by  this  principle).  The  second  principle  is  the  least  action  principle  (the  Einstein  field 
equation is implied by this principle). As the research will show that there are no contradicts or 
theoretic  gap  among  classical  mechanics,  general  reletivity  (gravitation),  and  the  quantum 
mechanics.  The  research  will  be  roughly  devided  into  three  parts.  (1).  The  classical  Newton 
mechanics is the aproximation when the time is constant flow. When the time is non-constant flow, 
the  Lorentz  transformation  must  be  introduced  to  meet  the  requirement  of  inertial  system.  This 
established  the  intrinsic  relationship  between  the  Newton  mechanics  and  special  relativity.  The 
gravity field is the intrinsic time gauge variation in space, that has been well explained in general 
relativity by the Schwarzshild solution. For such a kind of matter motion, the geometric feature of 
matter motion is commutative. (2). The pure time flow variation field is the electromagnetic field, 
which  will  be  fully  discussed  in  another  paper.  For  such  a  kind  of  matter  motion,  the 
non-commutative geometry will play an important role. This topic will be discussed in a special 
paper  (part  two)  later.  (3).  When  the  time  gauge  variation  is  coupled  with  the  space  gauge 
variation,  quantum  mechanics  will  be  established.  Hence,  the  quatum  mechanics  is  the  most 
complecated matter motion. However, they are intrinsicly related with the simple matter motion in 
a unified field theory form. This topic will be discussed in part three paper of this research.   

In this paper, the main topic is the intrinsic relation between the inertial system and special 
relativity.  The  research  shows  that  the  isotropy  of  inertial  mass  is  implied  by  the  principle  of 
spacetime isotropy. This will be explained in the main body of this paper.   

The  definition  of  inertial  system  reqiures  that  the  physical  laws  be  identical  for  inertial 
system. The research will show that for two relative moving inertial system this reqiurement will 
demand  the  Lorentz  transformation.  The  source  independent  of  light  speed  supports  the  the 
physical laws be identical for inertial system. So, this research shows the Lorentz transformation 
as the result of inertial system. Therefore, the Lorentz transformation is not basic and cannot be 
taken  as  the  base  of  physics.  That  is  to  say  the  Minkowski  spacetime  is  not  a  good  choice  for

physics,  although  it  is  correct  for  the  inertial  motion  and  the  commutative  geometric  theory  of 
gravitation field and quantum field. 

Based on this general view point, this paper firstly introduces the motion transformation. For 
its  relation  with  other  geometrical  theory  the  author  has  given  out  a  simple  explaination  [1]. 
Secondly, the inertia definition is fully examined to show the Lorentz transformation is reqiured 
by  the  definition  of  inertia.  Then  the  least  action  principle  is  used  to  establish  general  motion 
equations  for  matter  motion.  The paper  shows  that the  simplest  motion of  matter  is  the  Newton 
motion equations. Finally, based on the principle of physical laws be identical for inertial system, 
the  gavitation  field  is  established.  The  result  shows  that  inertial  mass  is  identical  with  the 
gravitational  mass  only  when  the  quntum  effects  and  elctromagnetic  field  can  be  ignored. 
Therefore, the identicy of inertial mass and gravitational mass can not be taken as basic principle 
for unified field theory. 
 
2. Matter Motion Transformation 

Although  the  absolute  space  and  time  (world  time)  defined  by  Newton  is  not  accepted  in 
physics, but it is a good concept for discuss matter motion in the inertial system. In this research, 
the absolut spacetime is defined as vacum or ether. The absolute spacetime has the ruler and clock 
as phisical gauge. The research will used the absolute space and time to parameterizing matter in 
its absolute motionless state.   

Introducing  “world  time”  as  time  coordinator  parameter  in  the  Riemannian  geometry 
attached with matter (be defined as four-dimensional co-moving coordinator system). By this way, 
a  matter  point  (event)  is  identified  geometrically  by  its  intrinsic  four-dimensional  position.  Its 
motion  will determine  its  actual gauge  field  which  is measured by “oberservor”  in  conventional 
geometry. Hence, the matter motion will be expressed by the variation of actual gauge field. As 
the  variation  of  gauge  field  can  be  expressed  by  the  transformation  of  basic  vectors  of 
four-dimensional co-moving coordinator system, the motion transformation is defined to describe 
the matter motion. 

The Riemannian geometry attached with matter in three-dimensional co-moving coordinator 
system  has  been  established  by  Chen  Zhida  [2-3].  His  research  shows  that  the  Riemannian 
geometry  attached  with  matter  is  determined  by  the  displacement  field  of  matter,  which  is 
measured by “observor” in conventional geometry. 

This paper defines the spacetime geometry attached with “observor” as “vacuum” geometry 
and  the  spacetime  geometry  attached  with  matter  as  the  Riemannian  geometry.  The  initial 
spacetime  geometry  attached  with  matter  is  taken  as  refference  geometry  (named  as  initial 
co-moving coordinator system), and the current spacetime geometry attached with matter (named 
as  current  co-moving  coordinator  system)  is  determined  by  the  four-dimensional  displacement 
field measured in initial spacetime geometry. 

In  the  initial  co-moving  coordinator  system,  matter  is  identified  by  four-dimensional 
co-moving  coordinators.  For  the  matter,  the  four-dimensional  co-moving  coordinators  are 
invariant while the actual gauge field is varying with matter motion (hence the four-dimensional 
co-moving coordinator system is varying with matter motion). 

The  initial  four-dimensional  co-moving  coordinator  system  is  defined  by  anti-covariant 

coordinators (

as the standard three-dimensional space adding time-dimension, in which following conditions are 
met:

where,  c   is light speed in “vacuum”. The difference with the Riemannian geometry of Einstein's 
theory is that time gauge in here is real rather than imaginary. 

By such a sellection, matter is defined in standard physical measuring system at initial time 

of motion. 

In  physics,  matter  motion  can  expressed  by  displacement  field 
physical measuring system. By above sellection, the displacement field

Generally,  the  transformation  tensor  is  non-commutative.  Its  covariant  index  and  contra-variant 
index are defined respects with to the initial four-dimensional co-moving coordinator system. Its 
more  strict  geometrical  theory  is  under  development  in  some  researches  (it  has  some  similarity 
with  the  concept  of  geometry  algebra,  Prof.  Chris  Doran,  Cavendish  Laboratory,  Cambridge 
University).   

It  is  clear  that  the  incremental  motion  of  matter  is  viewed  as  “deformation”  of  matter’s 
geometry. So, gravitation field is viewed as matter “deformation” respect with idea vacuum matter. 
According  to  Einstein's  idear [4-5],  the  Newton’s  inertial  coordinator  system  can  be  replaced  by 
the  gradient  field  of  infinitisimal  displacement.  The  equations  (2)  and  (3)  show  that  the 

displacement gradient determins the current local geometry. Hence, the transformation tensor

can be named as motion transformation. 

Matter motion in four-dimensional spacetime continuum is:

For observer, the standard physical measuring system is established in vaccum. If the vaccum 
is taken as a special matter which depends on cosmic feature where matter is moving, the vaccum 
can be viewed as refference matter for matter motion. By this understanding, for matter moving in 
another refference matter field, the initial four-dimensional co-moving coordinator system can be 
defined by the geometry of refference matter field. In fact, for incremental motion, the refference 
matter field is the matter itself in initial state. 

As the local time gauge in initial matter is:

Based on the definition of inertial system, when the 

iV   is the relative velocity between two 
inertial  system,  according  to  the  definition  of  inertial  system,  the  time  gauge  must  be  the  same. 
That is to say one must have:

When  the  velocity  V is  the  relative  moving  speed  of  inertial  coordinator  system,  as  the  time 

gauge is invariant for any inertial systems. To meet the inertial system definition, it means that the 
current time can be transformed into physical time by factor:

This will leads to Lorentz coordinator transformation when it is combined with Newton motion (to 
be discussed later). This time coordinator transformation factor has been well discussed in special

relativity. Here, the paper shows that Lorentz transformation is a natural result of Newton’s inertial 
system concept. 
 
This factor has been widely used to explain the time incremental of moving matter is longer 
than the time incremental of static matter. However, such an interpretation causes the twin paradox. 
In  this  research,  the  so-called  Lorentz  time  expansion  is  purely  the  results  of  inertial  system 
definition and the principle of the physical laws should be the same in any inertial system.   

3. Physical Meaning of Matter Motion and Motion Equation 

Matter  motion,  in  physical  meaning,  is  measured  by  an  observer  with  standard  physical 
coordinator system. Such a physical coordinator system is taken as inertial coordinator system in 
Newton’s physics, and physical quantity is well defined in inertial system. For Newton’s physics, 
matter  motion  is  performed  in  inertial  coordinator  system  defined  by  idea  vacuum.  This  paper 
views the idea vacuum as a special matter. So, matter motion will be measured by the deformation 
of  matter  with  respect  to  vacuum.  Hence,  the  matter  in  discussion  and  the  vacuum  form  a 
space-time  continuum.  From  this  viewpoint  to  see,  the  vacuum  matter  can  be  replaced  by  other 
suitable matter as reference matter. 

For  Newton’s  matter-point  mechanics,  the  deformation  is  defined  by  the  displacement 
measured  in the  co-moving  coordinator  system  attached  with vacuum  matter.  For  the  traditional 
continuum  mechanics,  the  internal-deformation  is  defined  by  the  co-moving  coordinator  system 
attached  with  the  matter  while  the  absolute  deformation  motion  is  described  by  Newton’s 
matter-point  mechanics.  For  the  quantum  mechanics,  the  deformation  is  defined  by  the 
displacement measured in the co-moving coordinator system attached with the quantum existing 
system. 

Based  above  understanding,  matter  motion  is  always  defined  with  reference  matter.  They 

form the space-time continuum. 

Once  the  matter  motion  is  well  defined  by  the  finite  geometric  field,  the  cause  of  matter 
motion must be defined. To this purpose, the least action principle raised by Einstein is taken as 
the basic principle for this research.   

As the only field until now is the matter transformation tensor and the action must be a scalar, 

the (ad hoc) simplest action of general deformation can be defined by the following equation: 

Action

By this way, the broad action of matter is non zero.

Under above definition, the intrinsic physical feature of matter is defined by: 

Usually, one does not care how the original matter motion state is in the absolute spacetime. One 
just takes the matter under discussion as a self-exist object. In this sense, the initial matter can be 
generally defined by select the initial co-moving coordinator system to make:

On this sense, the reference matter is taken to define the spacetime continuum where the matter 
under discussion is moving. 
 

The  principle  of  physical  laws  covariant  invariance  requires  the  general  reference  matter 

motion be coordinator independent. To meet these requirements, the tensor

tensor. Therefore, one has:

where,  λ  and  µ  are  the  intrinsic  feature  of  matter  referring  to  reference  matter.  For  Newton 

mechanics, the reference matter is vacuum or ether. For the isotropic tensor in mixture form please 
refer [6]. In standard physical theory, the mixed form is refused. However, the research shows that 
the  mixture  form  is  necessary  to  show  the  non-commutative  feature  of  matter  motion 
transformation tensor. This topic should treat in future rather at present.   

Based  on  the  isotropy  of  inertia  matter  in  spacetime  continuum,  the  inertial  matter  can  be 
0µ   (later  the  research  will  show  that  the  inertial  mass  is 

0λ   and 

described  by  two  parameters 
defined by parameter

0µ ). 

For a simple and idea isotropic matter, motion stress tensor

covariant or pure anti-covariant form, there three parameters are needed. 

If the vacuum is taken as reference matter, then the stress tensor is the stress acting on matter 
measured  by  inertial  coordinator  system  (or  say,  absolute  stress).  If  the  initial  co-moving 
coordinator  system  is  a  curvature  system,  the  above  equations  should  take  their  physical 
component form, as required in tensor theory.

which the space-time continuum is defined. Geometrically, the traditional convention of positive 
sign  corresponds  to  the  outside  normal  direction  of  matter  spatial  configuration  surface  (at  any 
time  there  is  a  special  spatial  configuration.  This  concept  is  well  established  by  the  theory  of 
general relativity. There is no need to introduce the supper-surface concept in higher dimensional 
spacetime in physics, although it may be very helpful in mathematical sense). 

Now,  the  paper  will  goes  to  details.  Note  that  for  simplicity,  here  the  initial  co-moving 
coordinator system is taken as the standard physical measuring system defined by equation (1), so 
starting  from  next  subsection  the  conventional  partial  deferential  will  be  used  to  replace  the 
covariant differential and physical component of tensor will used when it is appropriate without 

special  mention.  The  physical  component  of  tensor

4. Newton’s Equation for Mass-point 

For matter motion in vacuum reference, the Newton motion equation can be established. In 
this  paper,  inertial  matter  in  traditional  physics  (Newton  mechanics)  will  be  defined  as  such  a 
matter that the deformation of space-time continuum is symmetrical. The symmetry requirement 
will guarantees the commutative feature of matter motion. For rigid body without internal spatial 

deformation, the deformation 

i
i
jF δ−

  is symmetrical. For the pure Newton mass point, the time 

gradient of time displacement will require the factor defined by equation (12). The condition can 
be expressed as:

shows  that  the  matter  is  a  rigid  body,  which  is  predefined  by  the  deformation  without  internal 

spatial deformation. The 

4 =f

  is caused by ignoring the time gradient of time displacement. 

The above analysis shows that the Newton’s matter quality (inertial mass) is determined by 
 
the  sheer  constant  µ  between  matter  and  vacuum.  Further  consideration  shows  that  the  sheer 
constant  µ  is Einstein’s matter-energy. 

In finite geometrical field theory (gauge field theory), the symmetry of motion transformation 
implies there is no time-space rotation. This rotation-less condition is equivalent with the isotropy 
of inertial motion. The condition of no rotation between time and space is also the intrinsic feature 
of Lorentz transformation. 

5. Newton’s Equation in Special Relativity Theory 
  When the time gauge variation is not ignored, but contribution from the time gradient of time 
displacement can be ignored, the physical component form of motion deformation of space-time 
continuum is:

Therefore,  for  Newton  gravitation  field,  the  gravitation  mass  is  identical  with  the  inertial 

mass. The boundary condition, in fact, is source condition. 
 
mass, when the constant is determined by Newton gravity field. 
For a much broad class of reference matter, the equation (40) can not be true. That will leads 
 
to  the  introduction  of  electromagnetic  field  and  quantum  field,  where  the  meaning  of  matter  is 
general. 

The  above  analysis  shows  that  the  Newton’s  matter  quality  is  determined  by  the  sheer

0µ   between matter and vacuum. The zero volume deformation constant (that is 

0=q

constant 

shows that the inertial Newton matter is the simplest matter referring to vacuum.   

In  general  relativity  theory,  the  condition  of  no  rotation  between  time  and  space  is  used  to 

deduce Newton’s gravity equation, such as in the Schwarzschild’s solution of gravity field [7-8].

7.2 Compressible Newton’s Matter Motion Equation 

The  following  research  will  show  that  the  macro-deformation  of  Newton’s  matter  has 

intrinsic stress-strain relation equations. 

For compressible Newton’s matter, in the case that the cosmic force is zero, that is

In  this  case,  the  macro-spatial  deformation  of  Newtonian  matter  will  cause  time  displacement 
gradient. This will produce quantum motion. Therefore, the macro deformation is determined by 
the intrinsic structure of matter composition. This is because that from the definition of Newtonian 
matter, one gets:

That is, when the cosmic force component is zero, the spatial force is: 

It  gives  the  relation  for  matter  macro  spatial  volume  deformation  in  space-time  continuum 

with spatial force from cosmic background matter. 

In  engineering,  the  macro-matter  itself  is  taken  as  the  reference  matter  in  continuum 
mechanics.  The  physical  meaning  of  above  discussion  is  to  show  that  to  describe  macro 
continuum deformation, the two basic parameters can be obtained by the microphysics ways. In 

essential  sense,  it  shows  that  the  macro  deformation  parameters  ( µλ ~,

)  can  be  derived  by  basic 

~

parameters and micro matter components motion. For more complicated motion, that is the cosmic 
force is not zero, will not be performed in this paper. 
 
8. Zero Inertial Mass Matter Motion Equation 

Zero Newton’s mass field matter can be defined by

0=µ . For zero mass matter fields, such 

as  light  quantum  or  electromagnetic  field,  the  equation  can  be  simplified.  It  will  show  that  the 
volume deformation is possible. As:

For free matter field, that is the spatial forces are all zeros, one gets: 

As the equation is derived on the condition of force-less and mass-less, so it is the intrinsic 
geometrical  feature  of  the  spacetime  continuum.  In  fact,  this  solution  is  implied  by  the 
Schwarzschild’s solution of Einstein’s gravity field theory. Hence, Einstein has enough reason to 
view the gravity field as the curvature of space-time continuum. 
If the matter behaves as Newton’s matter, it becomes:

For  light,  as  its  speed  is  invariant,  the  equation  shows  that  the  light  will  have  no  spatial 
variation.  For  electromagnetic  field  in  medium,  the equation  shows that the  permittivity  and the 
magnetic  permeability  (their  conduct  determines  the  velocity)  are  related  with  the  curvature  of 
space-time continuum

This equation  shows that if  the  spacetime  is  defined by  mass-less  matter  motion,  the  space 
and time must have intrinsic relation. This is the underlying reason for the correctness of Lorentz 
transformation for electromagnetic field. 

This can be simply explained as the incompressibility of spacetime as a cosmic matter. This 
in  essential  sense  is  the  base  of  Lorentz  transformation  in  vacuum.  However,  based  on  this 
research, the Lorentz transformation can not be taken as the bases for general matter fields. 
 
9. Born Rigidity and Lorentz Transformation 

The definition of inertial system will require the Born rigidity. That is to say the distances of 
material  particles  remain  constant  with  respect  to  the  instantaneously  co-moving  inertial  system 
when  the  material  is  subjected  to  a  constant  proper  acceleration.  Such  a  rigidity  requirement 
should be physically sound in average sense. In the finite geometry field, according to equation (4), 
for  any  time  duration 
abT   between  two  temporal  points  A  and  B,  the  Born  rigidity  can  be 

expressed as:

It  means  that  the  square  of  average  incremental  displacement  equals  to  the  square  of  time 
incremental  interval.  In  form,  it  can  be  rewritten  as  the  local  geometrical  invariance  form  in 
coordinator notation as:

Therefore,  the  Lorentz  transformation  is  derived  from  the  definition  of  inertial  system  for  rigid 
material.  That  is  to  say,  the  Born  rigidity  of  inertial  system  definition  will  produce  the  Lorentz 
transformation.

This can be approximated as:

Therefore, to meet the Born rigidity the material must be accelerated by special ways. They 

are time-dependent, where the spatial displacements are parameters. 

The upper limit of light speed makes the acceleration can be approximated as:

equation is taken as the normality condition. 

Based on above analysis, it can be concluded that the quantum mechanics can be traced back 
to  the  same  principle  as  the  classical  mechanics.  Combining  with  the  conclusion  about  special 
relativity, it is clear the definition of inertial system is essential for the whole physics. The grand 
unified theory should base on the concept of inertia and the principle of general relativity.   
 
10. Conclusion 

The  research  shows  an  unified  field  theory  of  physics  can  be  established  with  the  idea 
introducing motion transformation, which is completely determined by the displacement gradient 
in  four-dimensional  space-time  continuum.  The  vacuum  is  taken  as  a  special  matter  with  one 
intrinsic  physical  parameter-light  speed  c .  For  any  matter,  it  can  be  identified  with  co-moving 
coordinators  with  local  varying  geometry.  The  local  varying  geometry  represents  the  motion  of 
matter  in  consideration.  The  motion  equation  of  matter  is  determined  by  cosmic  environment 
where the matter existing, where two intrinsic physical parameters are introduced to define matter 
as 

,( µλ . 

)

When the time gradient of time displacement is forced to be zero, the Newton’s physics for 
matter is gotten. It shows that the Newton’s mass is determined by the shear feature of space-time 

continuum. The Newton’s mass is expressed as 

/ cµρ=

2

. 

When  the  matter  has  no  macro  spatial  motion,  such  as  gravity  field  or  electronic  field,  the 
time displacement field is introduced to describe the matter motion. One finds that gravity field, 
electro-magnetic field, and quantum field are time gradient field. They are related with Newton’s 
mechanics  in  intrinsic  sense.  The  absolute  electrical  charge  quantity  may  be  expressed  as 
. When there is no electrical charge quantity, the gravity mass and the inertial mass in 
=q

( µλ+
)

Newton’s mechanics are the same.   

The  matter  has  three  typical  existing  forms:  traveling  waves,  localized  harmonic  vibrating 

particle, and exponential expanding or decaying matter field.   

The  commutable  matter  motion  defines  conservative  field.  The  non-commutable  matter 

motion defines quantum field, where 

  is defined as equivalent mass in Einstein’s 

(~
=
µλρ

++

µ
)
c

mass-energy  equation.The  wave  particle  duality  is  explained  by  deformable  matter  motion.  The 
observation  of  cosmic  expanding and  the  gravity field matter  in  three-dimensional  space  can  be 
explained. Finely, the paper introduces the Born rigidity of inertial motion to derive the Lorentz 
transformation.   

It can be concluded that the quantum mechanics can be traced back to the same principle as 
the  classical  mechanics.  Combining  with  the  conclusion  about  special  relativity,  it  is  clear  the 
definition  of  inertial  system  is  essential  for  the  whole  physics.  The  grand  unified  theory  should 
base  on  the  concept  of  inertia  and  the  principle  of  general  relativity.  So,  an  unified  physics  of 
matter motion can be expressed by the finite geometrical field theory.

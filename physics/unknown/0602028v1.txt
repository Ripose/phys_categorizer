Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy in the Research on the 
Foundations of Quantum Physics: E.P. Wigner(cid:146)s Case#

Dealing with Eugene Wigner(cid:146)s ideas on the measurement procedure in quantum 

physics and unearthing the controversy that pitted him against supporters of the 

interpretation of complementarity, I will show how Wigner and his followers contributed 

to the defeat of a seemingly unshakeable consensus.  In fact, although he intended to 

defend what seemed to him to be orthodoxy, he himself became a heterodox.  I suggest 

that Wigner(cid:146)s conjectures on the role of consciousness in physical phenomena were not 

fruitful and were discarded, being today part of the history of physics rather than physics 

proper.  However, his ideas and actions left an indelible mark on the physics of the 
second half of the 20th century.  Namely, he formulated his ideas in opposition to the 

(cid:147)Copenhagen monocracy,(cid:148) which held a stronghold on the interpretation of quantum 

physics until the late 1960s; he stressed the unsolved status of the measurement problem; 

and he effectively defended his ideas and supported those who were willing to investigate 

the foundations of quantum physics.  He thus contributed to the creation of a new field of 

physical research, that of the foundations of quantum physics, which attributed a higher 

scientific status to the old controversy on the interpretations and foundations of this 

theory.  This new field has had to deal with important theoretical, experimental, and 

philosophical issues, and significant repercussions have arisen in the last decades. 

The intrinsic historic worth of Wigner(cid:146)s case should be enough to justify its 

inclusion in a book organized to criticize the hubris of the contemporary scientism and to 

suggest, instead, the role of prudent knowledge for a decent life.  However, Wigner(cid:146)s case

is of general interest as this topic involves a contradiction: some contemporary physicists 

are inclined to deprecate Wigner(cid:146)s insight into the role of the mind in the measurement 
problem of quantum theory,1 yet these same individuals read Wigner(cid:146)s work neglecting 

to take into account the role he played in the context of the 1960s.  Judging any 

historically significant work by contemporary standards constitutes an error of 

anachronism, and preventing anachronistic narratives of past science may foster 

collaboration between science and society and counter irrationalism more effectively than 

distorted images of an idealized science. 

The Stage of a New Scientific Theory and its Problematic Foundations 

To understand the role Wigner played in the 1960s, one should take into account 

quantum theory(cid:146)s intellectual and historical context at that time.  This theory emerged 

between 1925 and 1927 as an ensemble of three different mathematical formalisms plus 

an interpretation of them offered by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr, which was 

christened the (cid:147)complementarity view,(cid:148) later known as the (cid:147)Copenhagen interpretation,(cid:148) 

the (cid:147)orthodox interpretation,(cid:148) and even the (cid:147)usual interpretation,(cid:148) besides simply 
(cid:147)complementarity.(cid:148) 2 Bohr(cid:146)s interpretation had a philosophical flavor which was 

unproblematic to physicists such as Pauli, Born, Heisenberg, but it became a hindrance to 

physicists from, for instance, the American and British milieux.  These physicists 

retained rules of formalism but did not incorporate its philosophy (Heilbron 2001).  It is 
beyond the scope of the current work to define complementarity,3 I will, however, 

demonstrate its relevance to the solution of the measurement problem, which was the 

central focus of the divergence between Bohr(cid:146)s views and those of John von Neumann 

                                                 
1 Gell-Mann (1994, 155), wrote: (cid:147)(cid:133) many sensible, even brilliant commentators have 
written about the alleged importance of human consciousness in the measurement 
process.  Is it really so important?(cid:148) OmnŁs (2002: 174), in a recent analysis, tried to put 
the mind-body thesis into context, but in previous papers he used derogatory phrases to 
describe such ideas.  Baptista (2002: 63-74) asked where it was that a serious physicist 
said consciousness plays a role in measurements.  He also wrote that Wigner speculated 
outside the boundaries of the natural sciences. 
2 For a technical distinction between formalism and interpretation, see (Jammer 1974). 
3 For the purposes of this text, I just need to emphasize that Bohr(cid:146)s complementarity 
treats measurement devices according to classical physics, not according to quantum 
physics.  This view stands in opposition to Wigner(cid:146)s, whereby measurement devices 
should instead be treated quantum mechanically.  For a standard, comprehensive 
description of complementarity, see Bohr(cid:146)s (1982) report of his discussions with Einstein.

and Eugene Wigner.  As an exemplar of this philosophical flavor, one may cite the way 

in which Bohr solved the so-called measurement problem; which is related to the reason 

why the superposition of quantum states (cid:150) the quantum identity (cid:150) did not appear in the 

macroscopic world of the measurement devices.  Bohr suggested that such devices had to 

be treated within the framework established by classical physics, not because one could 

not treat them from a quantum point of view, but because they need to be treated 

classically in order to communicate one(cid:146)s measurement results to other researchers.  As 

communication is a requirement to attain objectivity, and communication requires 

ordinary language refined by concepts from classical physics (e.g., concepts indicated by 

classical terms such as (cid:147)work,(cid:148) (cid:147)force,(cid:148) etc.), the classical treatment of measurement 

devices is a condition for preserving objectivity in scientific research.  As it happens, 

Bohr(cid:146)s solution was not accepted by John von Neumann, as we shall see below.  He 

rejected it as a consequence of his own mathematical work, in which, for the first time in 

the history of physics, he axiomatized quantum theory, identifying Hilbert spaces as the 

mathematical structure implied in those different mathematical formalisms (von 

Neumann 1932).  Von Neumann(cid:146)s position received continued support from Wigner.   

In the 1930s, complementarity also suffered strong criticisms from Albert Einstein 

and Erwin Schr(cid:246)dinger.  However legitimate those criticisms might have been, at that 

time they were not seen as such by the vast majority of physicists.  Of course, they are 

now central to the field of research we call foundations of physics.  These criticisms were 

not necessarily shared by those who excluded complementarity from their view of 

quantum theory, nor did these researchers necessarily foresee their significance.  In fact, 

before World War II, most physicists accepted that Bohr, Heisenberg, Pauli, and others 

had solved the foundational problems of quantum mechanics, even if they did not 

consciously share that solution.  Max Jammer (1974: 247-251) depicted this state of 

affairs as (cid:147)the almost unchallenged monocracy of the Copenhagen school in the 

philosophy of quantum mechanics.(cid:148) This diagnosis, however, does not reveal the 

existence of a true labor division among physicists. Monocracy of Copenhagen school 

meant two types of physicists. A few of them involved with foundational problems, 

extension of quantum mechanics to new phenomena and its applications to old and new 

problems, and the others involved with extension and applications, but believing that the 

foundationa problems were solved by the founding fathers of quantum mechanics.  

 

33

Beginning the early 1950s, however, this scenario slowly began to change. 

Besides Einstein and Schr(cid:246)dinger(cid:146)s renewed criticisms, other characters arrived on the 

scene.  These quantum mavericks included physicists like David Bohm, Imre FØnyes, 

Friedrich Bopp, Louis de Broglie, Henry Margenau, Alfred LandØ, D. Blokhintsev, I.P. 

Terletski, Hugh Everett, Jean-Pierre Vigier, and philosophers such as Karl Popper and M. 

Omel(cid:146)ianovskii.  The new main challenge to complementarity came from the causal, or 

(cid:147)hidden variables(cid:148) interpretation, suggested by David Bohm, in 1952.  In fact, he 

developed an approach that was able to reproduce known quantum predictions in the non-

relativistic domain, but his approach was embedded in a causal framework, not a 

probabilistic one in the manner of complementarity.  But no matter how interesting the 

causal interpretation might be, it was not accepted by physicists throughout the 1950s, in 

such a way that the Copenhagen monocracy was shaken, but not disabled (Freire 1999). 

Enter Wigner 

If the causal interpretation presented the greatest challenge to complementarity 

coming from outside the circle of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, another 

major challenge came from within.  E.P. Wigner was born in 1902, in Budapest, where he 

received his chemical engineer diploma.  Early, at the Lutheran high school, he met John 
von Neumann and became his friend and admirer forever.4 Together, they immigrated to 

the United States in order to jointly develop a mathematical physics program at Princeton 

in the 1930s.  In the early 1960s, Wigner(cid:146)s prestige was approaching its zenith.  He was 

recognized early on for his use of the theory of groups in quantum mechanics, and his 

recognition increased with his contributions to nuclear physics, including his 

participation in the Manhattan Project (Mehra 1993). 

Since the late thirties, Wigner began to play a role beyond physics proper, 

motivated by the military implications of recent discoveries in nuclear physics.  He and 

his Hungarian colleague L. Szilard suggested that Albert Einstein write the famous letter 

to President Roosevelt calling for the development of the U.S.(cid:146)s nuclear program 

(Doncel, Michel & Six 1984).  For the many roles he played in the Manhattan Project, he 

                                                 
4 Wigner considered von Neumann(cid:146)s mathematical work (1932) on the foundations of 
quantum mechanics (cid:147)more important than any of these inventions [computing machine 
and implosion bomb]. See E.P. Wigner, interviewed by W. Aspray, 04.12.1984.

was consequently awarded the title of (cid:147)the founder of nuclear engineering(cid:148) (Weinberg 

2002). After the war, Wigner(cid:146)s involvement with defense matters did not wane.  In the 

late fifties, he was one of the (cid:147)Princeton three,(cid:148) along with John Archibald Wheeler and 

Oskar Morgenstern, who pushed the American government to build an enormous national 

laboratory dedicated to defense research, an initiative that failed but eventually led to 

JASON, a group of academic physicists who advised the U.S. Department of Defense on 

defense matters (Aaserud 1995).  Wigner committed himself to advertising the role of 

civil defense in the Cold War context, and even built a nuclear fallout shelter in his own 
home.5   

In the early 1960s, Wigner decided to intensify his public involvement beyond 

physics, publishing papers on the philosophy of science, and dealing with the 

measurement problem of quantum mechanics.  This central issue in the foundations of 

quantum physics would be of interest not only to physicists but to other audiences as 

well, such as philosophers.  As we shall see, Wigner believed that the measurement 

problem was part of the philosophy of physics, which in turn he saw as an integral part of 

physics itself, a view that many of his colleagues did not share.  Before going to the 

1960s, it should be noted that since the 1930s, working with von Neumann, Wigner was 

interested in and contributed to measurements issues in quantum mechanics (Shimony 

1997).  In the early 1950s he resumed the subject showing how quantum formalism 

exhibits limitations of measurability (Wigner 1952).  In the same year, with G. Wick and 

A. Wightman, they further extended such limitations introducing the concept of a 

superselection rule.  None of those papers, however, were as influential as his 1960s(cid:146) 
works.6  

Between 1961 and 1963, Wigner published two papers that would become the 

centerpiece of his views on the foundations of quantum mechanics.  He revisited a 

distinction first emphasized by von Neumann between two kinds of evolution of quantum 

states.  The first one, continuous and causal, is governed by the Schr(cid:246)dinger equation.

6 For a technical presentation of Wigner(cid:146)s papers on quantum measurements, see 
(Shimony 1997), and G. Emch, (cid:147)Annotation(cid:148), in (Wigner 1995, pp. 1-28). Wigner’s 
emphasis on the inability of quantum theory to deal with measurement was not indepent 
of these early works on the limit of measurability implied by the mathematical formalism 
of the quantum theory, but I did not discuss this issue in this paper.

The second one, discontinuous and erratic, occurs during the measurement processes.  

Additionally, but still following von Neumann, he treated measuring devices quantum 

mechanically, instead of treating them classically as suggested by Bohr.  The latter choice 

leads to the propagation of the singular superposition of quantum states from the system 

under scrutiny to the ensemble: system plus the measuring apparatuses.  In mathematical 

terms, this propagation is represented by the inner product between the two Hilbert 

vectors, one related to the system and the other related to the devices.  As nobody has 

ever seen such a bizarre superposition in our macroscopic world, one needs to answer 

how, where, and when this superposition becomes a vector with just one component.  

After all, what we get after measurements is related to vectors and probabilities rather 

than to superposition of vectors.  Wigner emphasized this point and arrived at the next 

conclusion: in order to eliminate this superposition one needs to admit that measurement 

leads eventually to the role of the observer(cid:146)s introspection, i.e., when the information 

enters the mind of the observer. 

Conjecturing that mind plays a not eliminable role in the description of quantum 

measurements was one of Wigner distinctive feature when approaching the measurement 

problem. According to him (Wigner 1961), (cid:147)when the province of physical theory was 

extended to encompass microscopic phenomena, through the creation of quantum 

mechanics, the concept of consciousness came to the fore again: it was not possible to 

formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to 

the consciousness.(cid:148) He presented his arguments following two steps. The first, and less 

incisive, was that the quantum state changes every time the observer gets new 

information from observations. While in classical mechanics you also need observation to 

get the initial conditions and establish the classical state, when you get them and solve the 

equations of motion, new information is no more relevant to change the state. In the 

second step, he strengthened his case, presenting an idealized experiment in order to 

demonstrate the difference between quantum descriptions of measurements with and 

without human observers.  Nowadays the argument related to Wigner(cid:146)s idealized 

experiment is known as (cid:147)Wigner(cid:146)s friend(cid:148) (Wigner 1961).  Wigner suggests you observe, 

helped by a friend, an object quantum described by a linear combination of two states.  

Your friend observes the object hence, to him it is in one of the two states and no more in 

a linear combination of the two.  Before he tells you the result of the observation, there 

 

66

will be a conflict between your description of the object (linear combination of the two 

states) and that given by your friend (one of the two states).  Since the right quantum 

description is yours, you must admit that your (cid:147)friend was in a state of suspended 

animation before he answered(cid:148) your question, which is not a reasonable conclusion, and 

allowed Wigner to arrive to the conclusion that quantum theory is not enough to deal 

with measurements. So, if quantum theory is to encompass not only inanimate bodies, but 

also life and mind, it needs to be changed, and Wigner suggested explicitly to look for a 
non linear equation of motion.7  In fact, he was suggesting a true research program: to 

solve the measurement problem, including, from Wigner(cid:146)s point of view, the inclusion of 
life and mind in the scope of physical theories.8 

Furthermore, Wigner(cid:146)s arguments entailed a more sociological and historical 

question: to define the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics, and to identify its 

protagonists.  He wrote: (cid:147)The standard view is an outgrowth of Heisenberg(cid:146)s paper in 

which the uncertainty relation was first formulated.  The far-reaching implications of the 

consequences of Heisenberg(cid:146)s ideas were first fully appreciated, I believe, by von 

Neumann, but many others arrived independently at conclusions similar to this.  There is 

a very nice little book, by London and Bauer, which summarizes quite completely what I 

shall call the orthodox view.(cid:148) (Wigner 1963).  Bohr(cid:146)s paper on complementarity is only 

referred in a footnote.  In Wigner(cid:146)s account, therefore, Bohr and complementarity go to 

the backstage corridor of the quantum story, and Heisenberg and von Neumann become 

its chief protagonists.  I interpret this excerpt as a dispute over the intellectual heritage of 

the founder fathers of quantum mechanics.  It was not by chance that Wigner wrote this 

                                                 
7 In his 1961(cid:146)s paper, he wrote one section under the heading (cid:147)Non-linearity of Equations 
as Indicators of Life.(cid:148) Later, (Wigner 1973), he kept the same stance, (cid:147)it seems unlikely 
[(cid:133)] that the superposition principle applies in full force to beings with consciousness. If 
it does not, of if the linearity of the equations of motion should be invalid for systems in 
which life plays a significant role, the determinants of such systems may play the role 
which proponents of the hidden variable theories attribute to such variables. All proofs of 
the unreasonable nature of hidden variables are based on the linearity of the equations.(cid:148) 
8 Wigner(cid:146)s conjecture about the role of mind in quantum physics was strongly 
intertwined with his metaphysical and epistemological beliefs. He kept a dualistic view 
about mind and matter and maintained the former was primary. He criticized mechanistic 
approaches to the question of life since, for him, the phenomenon of consciousness 
entreats us to admit the existence of biotonic laws, that is, laws of nature not contained in 
the laws of physics (Wigner 1972, 1997a, 1997b). I will not, however, extend here my 

 

77

text after von Neumann’s and Bohr’s deaths, and while scientists and historians in the 

U.S. were involved in one of the largest projects ever to collect and store records 

significant in the creation and evolution of a scientific theory, which would come to be 

known as the Archives for the History of Quantum Physics (Kuhn, Heilbron & Forman 

1967). 

Wigner(cid:146)s papers drew both support and opposition.  Abner Shimony was very 

impressed by it: (cid:147)I found your paper on the mind-body problem extremely stimulating.  It 

is one of the few treatments of the problem which considers the mind-body relationship 

to be a legitimate subject for scientific investigation, without achieving this scientific 
status for the problem by reducing it to behavioristic or materialistic considerations.(cid:148)9 M. 

Satosi Watanabe also reacted very favorably to Wigner(cid:146)s suggestion about the role of 

consciousness in physical processes, and we find in their correspondences a true 

anticipation of subsequent opposition to Wigner(cid:146)s ideas from Rosenfeld, as well as 
Rosenfeld(cid:146)s Marxist motivation to take such a position.10 

It was up to Rosenfeld to oppose Wigner in defense of complementarity.  

Rosenfeld was Bohr(cid:146)s former assistant since the 1930s, and a physicist very sensitive to 

epistemological matters.  Rosenfeld and Wigner had, however, quite different profiles on 

a number of issues.  Politically, Wigner was very conservative (cid:150) he was a follower of the 

Republican Party and was supportive of U.S. foreign policy to the point of receiving a 

                                                                                                                                                
analysis of his broader philosophical views. To a discussion on such issue, see (Esfeld 
1999). Thanks to Ron Anderson for bringing this paper to my attention.

10 Apparently, Wigner underestimated the ideological background of the quantum 
controversy.  He wrote to Watanabe on August 30, 1961, (cid:147)Do you know of any political 
background that has come into the open in these discussions?  I am under the happy 
impression that we can keep the discussion on these subjects free from politics and am 
not aware of anyone having brought in any doctrine into the argument.(cid:148)  Watanabe(cid:146)s 
reply of December 15, 1961, is premonitory of the Wigner-Rosenfeld(cid:146)s dispute: (cid:147)(cid:133) I 
have indeed had quite a few experiences myself of being exposed to shameless attacks by 
Marxists in Japan for what they call my bourgeois idealism.  In spite of the fact that 
Marxism is not a mechanical materialism, they are dead against giving any kind of 
independent reality to consciousness.  There are Marxists who are quite broad-minded 
(like Prof. Rosenfeld) in many respects, but they usually become quite emotional when 
the topic touches upon their basic dogmas. (I was rather disappointed by the partisan 
emotion which tainted Prof. Rosenfeld(cid:146)s paper on Statistical Mechanics which was 
published in Poland.  Even a broadminded Marxist like Prof. Rosenfeld acts like this.(cid:148))

effort.11  In contrast, Rosenfeld was engaged in Marxist philosophy since the thirties.  

Rosenfeld(cid:146)s Marxism was closer to Western Marxism than it was to Soviet Marxism, to 

use terms introduced by Perry Anderson (1979) in order to make sense of Marxist trends 
in the 20th century.12 Rosenfeld participated actively in the late 1940s and 1950s in 

organizations and movements, such as the (cid:147)World Federation of Scientific Workers,(cid:148) 

(cid:147)Science for Peace,(cid:148) and the (cid:147)Manchester University Socialist Society.(cid:148) His political 
records led him to doubt about applying a visa to visit the U.S, in the Cold War times.13  

Intending to preserve what seemed to him to be a dialectical feature of complementarity, 

Rosenfeld criticized both the Soviet and Marxist physicists, like D. Blokhintsev and D. 

Bohm, who were themselves critics of complementarity, and physicists like Heisenberg, 

who leaned towards idealism (Rosenfeld 1953).  So, for a number of reasons (cid:150) political, 

ideological, and philosophical (cid:150) Rosenfeld could not accept a view like Wigner(cid:146)s, which 

assigned a central role to the mind in physical phenomena. 

Wigner and Rosenfeld also displayed significant differences in their approach to 

the measurement problem.  We could also speak of different scientific styles.  For 

Wigner, following von Neumann, dissecting the mathematical formalism of quantum 

physics in order to exhibit its axiomatic structure was a necessary step in grasping the 

theory(cid:146)s full implications.  That is not to say that for Wigner axiomatic theories were 

necessary for all research in physics since in other fields, nuclear physics for instance, his 
approach was phenomenological.14 But for Rosenfeld, following Bohr, a 

                                                 
11 R. Nixon to Wigner, June 22, 1970: (cid:147)Encouragement is always gratifying, but I 
particularly appreciated your very thoughtful letter and I want you to know how pleased I 
was to hear from you.  Your support for our policies toward Southeast Asia means a great 
deal to America’s fighting men, and needless to say, it means a great deal to me.(cid:148) WP, 
Box 97, folder 3.  
12 Anderson(cid:146)s distinction is driven to label those Marxist intellectuals, such as Lukacs, 
Korsch, Bloch, and Adorno, who took distance from the Soviet Marxism and the Western 
Communist parties related to it.  The distinction is not trivial since Antonio Gramsci, the 
leader of Italian Communism, is considered, for his works, part of the Eastern Marxism.  
Roughly used, however, it is useful to understand Rosenfeld(cid:146)s Marxism. 
13 See letters to L. Rosenfeld, from J. A. Wheeler [March 27, 1952]; R. E. Marshak 
[September 24, 1954], and A. Roberts [December 22, 1955]. RP. 
14 I am thankful to Sam Schweber for discussion on this isue. Commenting on the founder 
fathers of quantum mechanics, Schweber (1996) wrote: (cid:147)Wigner stands out by being, on 
the one hand, the theorist who had perhaps the greatest affinity to pure mathematics and, 
on the other, probably the most phenomenologically inclined among them.(cid:148) 

 

99

phenomenological insight into a physical theory was the best way to understand it, and he 

always emphasized his distrust of the reach of axiomatic treatment of physical theories.  

Even before his dispute with Wigner, he wrote: (cid:147)the (cid:145)axiomatizers(cid:146) do not realize that 

every physical theory must necessarily make use of concepts which cannot, in principle, 

be further analyzed, since they describe the relationship between the physical systems 

which is the object of study and the means of observation by which we study it: these 

concepts are those by which we give information about the experimental arrangement, 

enabling anyone (in principle) to repeat the experiment.  It is clear that in the last resort 
we must here appeal to common experience as a basis for common understanding.(cid:148)15  

Last but not least, Rosenfeld maintained that complementarity was the great 

epistemological lesson of quantum theory, and for this reason, he could not accept 

Wigner(cid:146)s position, according to which, Bohr(cid:146)s complementarity played no role in the 

orthodox interpretation of quantum theory. 

The Heated Dispute: Wigner Versus Rosenfeld and the Italians 

Rosenfeld(cid:146)s strategy for criticizing Wigner(cid:146)s view was to give strong praise to a 

certain work, by writing, (cid:147)these misunderstandings [i.e., that the translation of Bohr(cid:146)s 

argument into the formal language of the theory should present unrecognized 

difficulties], which go back to the deficiencies in von Neumann(cid:146)s axiomatic treatment, 

have only recently been completely removed by the very thorough and elegant discussion 

of the measuring process in quantum mechanics carried out by Daneri, Loinger and 

Prosperi(cid:148) (Rosenfeld, 1965).  These Italian physicists had used the ergodic theorem to 

explain quantum measurements as a thermodynamic amplification of a signal, triggered 

by the interaction between quantum systems and measurement devices (Daneri, Loinger 

& Prosperi 1962).  Indeed, the Italian physicists had quantum mechanically treated both 

the system and the interaction between the system and the measurement device, but, after 

the interaction ended, they considered the measurement device evolving according 

classical statistical physics, which was compatible with Bohr(cid:146)s requirement that the 

measurement devices should be considered classical bodies. It(cid:146)s clear that if Rosenfeld(cid:146)s 

point of view about the reach of the Italian work were accepted, Wigner(cid:146)s claims would

be considered ungrounded.  The dispute lasted throughout the second half of the 1960s, 

and it was marked by bitter arguments, even though it dealt with rather technical content, 

i.e., to determine whether the Italian work was a rigorous solution or just an 

approximation.  Wigner was specially struck by the next paper of the Italian physicists 

(Daneri, Loinger, and Prosperi 1966), in which they criticized Wigner, Shimony, 

Moldauer, Yanase, and Jauch(cid:146)s analyses of the measurement problem, and wrote that 

(cid:147)none of them gives new substantial contributions to the subject.(cid:148)  He wrote to J. M. 

Jauch suggesting a reply, and admitting that he was specially irritated not by the attack on 

him but by its significance for young researchers like Abner Shimony and Michael 
Yanase, his ex-students.16 The letter to Jauch was a typical maneuver for recruiting allies, 

as Wigner was not in complete accord with Jauch, notwithstanding the fact that the latter 

was trying to refine von Neumann(cid:146)s mathematical treatment.  Jauch did not agree with 

Wigner(cid:146)s conjecture on the role of mind in the measurement process and believed that the 

changes he himself had introduced in von Neumann(cid:146)s treatment had transformed the 

difference between the two kinds of evolution of the state vector into a pseudo-problem.  

Wigner suggested to Jauch that they write a common response, together with Yanase, 

Wigner(cid:146)s former student.  Looking for allies, Wigner went so far as to suggest that Jauch 

include in their joint paper a favorable citation of a paper by David Bohm and Jeffrey 

Bub.  However, Jauch could not accept this last proposal since, in his own work, he was 

trying to reinforce von Neumann(cid:146)s proof against hidden variables, while Bohm and Bub(cid:146)s 
work was in line with that last approach.17 Afterwards, Rosenfeld (1968) and Loinger 

(1968) replied to Wigner, Jauch and Yanase(cid:146)s paper, but the next round did not take place 

in papers published in journals.  Instead, Wigner waited for the Varenna school to have a 

live debate, as we shall see.  First, however, consider that Rosenfeld was not in an easy 

position during this dispute.  In 1952, he labeled David Bohm, the leader of the first 

round of dissent, as a (cid:147)tourist,(cid:148) or a (cid:147)dilettante(cid:148), in the field of the foundations of 

                                                 
16 (cid:147)I just finished reading the article of Daneri Loinger and Prosperi in the July issue of 
Nuovo Cimento and am really a bit irritated by it.  First of all, it is not good taste to say 
about a set of articles that they do not make substantial contributions to a subject.  
Needless to say, I am less concerned about myself than about other people who are much 
younger than I am and whose future careers such statements may hurt.(cid:148)  Letter from E.

quantum mechanics,18 but he could not deal in the same way with the 1963 Nobel Prize 

winner, Eugene Wigner.  His manner of arguing likely had something to do with 

Rosenfeld not being invited to talk at that summer school by Bernard d(cid:146)Espagnat, its 
director.  Instead, for Rosenfeld(cid:146)s side of the dispute, d(cid:146)Espagnat invited Prosperi.19 Let 

us say that the very existence of this school evidenced the changing mood among 

physicists concerning the status of research on foundations of quantum theory (Freire 
2003).20 

The dispute eventually ended at the Varenna summer school, which Wigner 

succeeded in transforming into an agreement on the need for a research program on 

quantum measurement processes.  Wigner gave the main talk at Varenna (d(cid:146)Espagnat 

1971: 1-19), and Prosperi spoke about (cid:147)macroscopic physics and the problem of 

measurement in quantum mechanics,(cid:148) in a section dedicated to (cid:147)Measurement and basic 

concepts(cid:148) (Op. cit.: 97-122).  An informal discussion between Wigner and Prosperi 
ensued from these lectures.  Assisted by Shimony and d(cid:146)Espagnat,21 Wigner 

reconstructed his arguments and had them published (Op. cit.: 122-126).  It(cid:146)s worth 

taking a detailed look at Wigner(cid:146)s conclusions because we can discern in them two 

distinctive features of Wigner(cid:146)s approach to foundations of quantum physics: his 

diplomatic and open-minded attitudes, and his consideration of the philosophy of physics 

                                                                                                                                                
17 The suggestion to quote Bohm and Bub(cid:146)s paper came from Shimony [Letter to Wigner, 
January 1, 1967]. This letter records Shimony(cid:146)s first reaction to what we now call (cid:147)Bell(cid:146)s 
inequalities.(cid:148) WP, Box 83, folder 7.

20 Varenna(cid:146)s courses, organized by the Italian Society of Physics, had been regularly 
carried out since 1953, in the summer, in Varenna, on Como Lake.  The 1970 course was 
dedicated to the theme (cid:147)Foundations of Quantum Mechanics(cid:148), following a suggestion 
from Franco Selleri supported by Toraldo di Francia, then the president of that society.  It 
had 84 participants, and its proceedings (d(cid:146)Espagnat 1971) reveals a diversified spectrum 
of subjects, such as measurement, hidden variables and non-locality, interpretations, and 
people, such as Wigner, Jauch, Shimony, d(cid:146)Espagnat, Bell, de Broglie, Selleri, and 
Bohm. D(cid:146)Espagnat, who was its head, suggested in an invitation letter some diplomatic 
rules to be followed in order to have a pacific and creative coexistence in which to 
discuss scientific controversies.

as part of physics.  He divided them into two items, the first one related to (cid:147)the 

philosophical problem,(cid:148) and the second about (cid:147)questions of physical theory.(cid:148)  He 

explained that the main question at the center of both Prosperi(cid:146)s and of his own concerns 

was related to the knowledge of the (cid:147)reason for the statistical, that is probabilistic, nature 

of the laws of quantum-mechanical theory.(cid:148)  In other words, how can one understand that 

quantum predictions are not (cid:147)uniquely given by the inputs(cid:148) even though equations of 

quantum and classical physics are deterministic?  He suggested one might answer this 

question in different ways, and cleverly framed Prosperi(cid:146)s and his own responses into the 

same side.  This type of answer implies that (cid:147)the possible reason for the probabilistic 

nature of quantum theory(cid:146)s conclusions concerning the outcomes of measurements is that 

the theory cannot completely describe the process of measurement, that some part of the 

process is not subject to the equations of quantum mechanics.(cid:148)  The difference between 

Wigner(cid:146)s and Prosperi(cid:146)s views resided in (cid:147)the area to which quantum mechanics is 

inapplicable.(cid:148)  For Prosperi, probability is necessary for the translation of the quantum-

mechanical description into classical description because this translation is not unique.  

To Wigner, as for von Neumann, either quantum mechanics does not (cid:147)apply to the 

functioning of the mind(cid:148) or (cid:147)the conscious content of the mind is not uniquely given by 

its state vector.(cid:148)  Finally, arguing on more scientific grounds, Wigner remarked that 

Prosperi and collaborators were using phrases such as (cid:147)macroscopic variables(cid:148) and 

(cid:147)macroscopic objects(cid:148) without giving a precise definition of these terms.  He 

remembered examples of phenomena with macroscopic bodies but which exhibit 

quantum features, such as permanent currents in superconductors and spontaneous 

magnetization in different directions, besides the observable difference between dextro 

and levorotatory sugar, which is based on a quantum relation of microscopic phases.  In 

his conclusion, Wigner once more looked for areas of agreement between the two 

physicists and presented a proposal for a genuine research program.  He concluded that 

since Prosperi(cid:146)s premises could not be rigorously formulated (at least not at that time), 

and their formulation would entail a significant modification of the theory current at that 

time, the convergence resided in the conclusion, common to Prosperi and Wigner(cid:146)s 

views, namely (cid:147)the inapplicability of quantum mechanics to some part of the 

measurement process has to be postulated or admitted(cid:148). Surely, Wigner had been 

postulating this for some time, and he was asking Prosperi to admit it.  If it were 

 

1313

Rosenfeld at the Varenna school, one might suppose that he would not admit it because 

for him, according to Bohr(cid:146)s views, concepts such as (cid:147)macroscopic variables(cid:148) or 

(cid:147)macroscopic bodies(cid:148) should be admitted without previous definitions since one gains 

nothing when trying to axiomatize, or to define, all theoretical terms.  As close as his 

views were to Bohr(cid:146)s, Prosperi thought differently and conceded to Wigner.  He did not 

publish any additional reports on his own arguments, and returned from Varenna to Milan 
convinced that the measurement problem was still unsolved.22 

It is important to consider how Wigner(cid:146)s contemporaries interpreted his dispute 

with Rosenfeld and the Italian physicists.  O.R. Frisch, in a colloquium held in 1968, 

said: (cid:147)I understand that at present there exists a controversy, roughly speaking between a 

group of people which includes Wigner as the best known person and another group 

centered on Milan in Italy, and that these two have different views on how this reduction 

happens.(cid:148) (Frisch 1971: 14).  For the first time in the literature, the name (cid:147)Princeton 

school(cid:148) was used to differentiate Wigner(cid:146)s views from the Copenhagen school.  

According to Ballentine (1970: 360), there were (cid:147)several versions of the Copenhagen 

interpretation(cid:148) and, (cid:147)although both claim orthodoxy, there now seems to be a difference 

of upholds between what may be called the Copenhagen school represented by 

Rosenfeld, and the Princeton school represented by Wigner(cid:148). Since then, labeling 

Copenhagen and Princeton schools has become current in the literature (Home & 

Whitaker 1992).  The monocracy was thus broken, from inside, as was the fate of many 
other monocracies of the 20th century.  I do not want to say that Wigner was the sole 

driving force to break that monocracy.  In the same second half of the 1960s, the Irish 

physicist John Bell also made major contributions to it.  He demonstrated flaws in von 

Neumann(cid:146)s mathematical proof against (cid:147)hidden variables(cid:148) in quantum mechanics, and 

revealed that quantum formalism leads to the strange physical property of entanglement 
between systems that are separated in the space-time.23 Other factors also contributed to 

change the physicists(cid:146) attitudes related to the research in foundations of quantum 

mechanics, but I will not discuss them here (Freire 2003 & 2004).  What I am saying is 

that Wigner made a major contribution in this direction, which is not always recognized

Wigner(cid:146)s Style of Intellectual Leadership 

The portrait of Wigner as just a disputant in the creation of the field of 

foundations of quantum mechanics is not completely fair to him.  He engaged in a variety 

of activities and assumed a kind of non-dogmatic but highly influential leadership.  He 

formed a group of students to work on the subject, such as Abner Shimony, who held a 

Ph.D. in Physics with a dissertation on the foundations of statistical mechanics, and 

Michael Yanase, a Jesuit priest whose dissertation treated the measurement problem.  We 

have already seen how he mobilized Yanase to join the debate with the Italians.  Shimony 

(1993: xii) gave us a very impressive testimony about the role Wigner played in his 

career: (cid:147)I am most deeply grateful to Eugene Wigner, [who] encouraged my later work 

on foundations of quantum mechanics.  The preponderance of the physics community at 

that time accepted some variant of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics 

and believed that satisfactory solutions had already been given to the measurement 

problem, the problem of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, and other conceptual difficulties.  My 

decision to devote much research effort to these problems would have been emotionally 

more difficult without Wigner(cid:146)s authority as one of the great pioneers and masters of 

quantum mechanics.(cid:148)  The bulk of the correspondence exchanged between Shimony and 

Wigner on philosophical matters suggests that Wigner also benefited from that 

intellectual relationship because, in fact, Shimony acted informally as Wigner(cid:146)s assistant 

on philosophical matters.  Wigner was also supportive of entrants and non-entrants in the 

field, such as Bernard d(cid:146)Espagnat, Henry Margenau, and John Archibald Wheeler.  

Bernard d(cid:146)Espagnat was already a senior-level high energy physicist when he decided, in 

the 1960s, to resume a project begun in his younger days, to philosophize on the 
problems of contemporary physics.24 He found Wigner a dialoguer, even if he did not 

completely share Wigner(cid:146)s view, and Rosenfeld an ironic and bitter critic, when he 
accepted some of Wigner(cid:146)s positions.25  Unlike d(cid:146)Espagnat, Margenau was a seasoned 

                                                                                                                                                
23 Comparing the two physicists, Schweber (1996) wrote: (cid:147)Except for John Bell, no one 
addressed these foundational issues as critically as Wigner did.(cid:148) 
24 d(cid:146)Espagnat, quoted interview.  
25 As early as February 18, 1964, d(cid:146)Espagnat criticized Jauch for his idea that mixture and 
pure state are in the same (cid:147)equivalence class,(cid:148) and supported Wigner: (cid:147)This is a matter 
into which I always took a great interest and I found your article in AJP very 
illuminating.(cid:148) [WP, Box 94, Folder 1].  Later, Rosenfeld praised d(cid:146)Espagnat(cid:146)s book 

1515

veteran in the field of foundations of physics as he had been criticizing the 

complementarity view since the 1930s.  In the early 1960s, he welcomed Wigner(cid:146)s 

analysis of quantum measurement, which motivated him to resume his own ideas and to 
present them in a clearer and more concise way.26  They engaged in a published debate 

with Hillary Putnam over the conceptual structure of quantum mechanics and planned to 
write a book together, but this project was never seriously initiated.27  In the late 1960s, 

Wigner accepted Margenau(cid:146)s invitation to be a member of the editorial board of a new 

journal, Foundations of Physics, aimed at fostering research of (cid:147)disciplined speculations 
suggestive of new basic approaches in physics,(cid:148)28 including those concerning the 

foundations of quantum mechanics.  Wigner not only accepted this invitation but 

assumed editorial responsibilities of the journal, suggesting papers and influencing the 
choice of editor who would replace Margenau upon retirement.29 

                                                                                                                                                
(1965), but not the paper in which d(cid:146)Espagnat (1966) suggested a generalization of 
Wigner(cid:146)s point of view, according to which (cid:147)the framework of the orthodox theory of 
(ideal) measurements(cid:148) means that these cannot as a rule be described by means of linear 
quantum mechanical laws.  d(cid:146)Espagnat wrote to Rosenfeld (26 February 1966), (cid:147)Je tiens 
(cid:224) vous remercier pour [(cid:133)] l(cid:146)approbation que vous avez la gentilesse d(cid:146)y exprimer (cid:224) 
l(cid:146)Øgard de mon livre.(cid:148)  Four months later, Rosenfeld wrote (8 July 1966), (cid:147)[votre dernier

besoin de vous retremper dans l(cid:146)air pur de Copenhague [d(cid:146)Espagnat had been there in

A final example, and perhaps the most significant example of Wigner(cid:146)s influence 

on certain contemporaries, is John Archibald Wheeler, a physicist well known for his 

insights, both sound and speculative, in fields as diverse as cosmology and quantum 

physics.  The two men were very close not only in science, but also in political matters 

and in defense-related research.  As we have seen, Wigner and Wheeler were two of the 

(cid:147)Princeton three(cid:148) who were involved at the outset of the JASON project.  In foundations 

of quantum mechanics, however, Wheeler(cid:146)s views were very close to Bohr(cid:146)s, but Wigner 

was so influential that, by the mid-70s, he began to doubt what Bohr(cid:146)s real opinion was 

on the role of consciousness in the quantum measurement process.  Haunted by this 

doubt, he wrote the following to Niels Bohr(cid:146)s son, Aage Bohr: (cid:147)I have the impression, 

perhaps mistaken, that your father at one time thought that for the making of an 

observation it only took in the end an irreversible account of amplification; but that later 

on he changed his position to something closer to the idea that no observation is an 

observation unless and until it enters the consciousness.  However, I am not able to find 

anything to document this supposed change of view and my understanding of the history 

may be quite wrong.(cid:148) Without a response from the younger Bohr, he tried the unusual 

procedure of asking a friend who was in Copenhagen, John Hopfield, to answer a 

questionnaire, after consulting Bohr, which included the following item: (cid:147)Niels Bohr did 

change position from (a) (cid:145)Measurement requires irreversible act of amplification(cid:146) to (b) 

something closer to Wigner(cid:146)s (cid:145)a measurement is not a measurement until the result has 

entered the consciousness(cid:146) YES ___; NO ___; QUESTION ILL DEFINED ___.(cid:148) This 

time, however, it did not take long for Aage Bohr to send a reply corroborating the 

accuracy of Rosenfeld(cid:146)s interpretation of Niels Bohr(cid:146)s views.  Aage Bohr wrote: (cid:147)[(cid:133)] 

our reactions can be deduced from the answers to the questionnaire which you have 

formulated so cleverly that no evasion is possible.  Let me just add that it is quite true that 

my father strongly emphasized that for an unambiguous description it is essential to 

include the detection device in the definition of a quantum phenomenon and even 

advocated that one reserved the word (cid:145)phenomenon(cid:146) for processes that are (cid:145)closed(cid:146) in this 

sense.  However, I do not think he meant this to imply that the act of observation need 
have any effect on the processes which generated the phenomenon in question.(cid:148) 30

It is worthwhile to conclude these comments about Wigner(cid:146)s style of intellectual 

influence with a remark about one of his characteristics that the reader has surely noted, 

namely, the non-dogmatic manner in which he dealt with the subjects related to the 

foundations of quantum mechanics.  Shimony was well situated to attest to this 

characteristic because his point of view on the role of the mind in quantum mechanics, 
different as it was from Wigner(cid:146)s, did not impinge on their close collaboration.31 

According to Shimony (2002), one of the salient features of Wigner(cid:146)s contribution to the 

measurement problems in quantum mechanics was (cid:147)[f]reedom from dogmatism, open-

mindedness towards new ideas, [(cid:133)] and in general an exploratory attitude regarding the 

frontiers of physics, other sciences, and of philosophy.(cid:148)  Still, according to Shimony, 

(cid:147)consequently, it is a historical error and a misunderstanding of his work, to speak of 

(cid:145)The Wigner solution to the measurement problem(cid:146) without attention to his exploratory 

attitude.(cid:148)  One last example is related to the reaction to the approach suggested by H. 

Dieter Zeh (1970).  This approach was critical both of Wigner(cid:146)s and of the Italian 

physicists(cid:146) approach because both admitted the validity of Schr(cid:246)dinger(cid:146)s equation to 

describe the measurement devices, and according to Zeh measurement devices are not 

closed systems to which such an equation could be applied.  Wigner received a preprint 

version of Zeh(cid:146)s paper, supported its publication in the first volume of Foundations of 

Physics, and opened his Varenna talk with six possible solutions to the measurement 

problem, Zeh(cid:146)s solution being the last. According to Zeh, a preliminary version (in 

German) of this paper had been rejected by several journals in 1967, (cid:147)the usual answer 

being that (cid:145)quantum theory does not apply to macroscopic objects,(cid:146)(cid:148) a kind of answer 
based on Bohr(cid:146)s and Rosenfeld(cid:146)s point of view.32

31 In his first published paper on the foundations of quantum mechanics, Shimony (1963) 
analyzed these two proposals for interpreting quantum state evolution during 
measurements: von Neumann(cid:146)s and Bohr(cid:146)s approaches.  His point of view on the former 
was that (cid:147)although this interpretation appears to be free from inconsistencies, it is not 
supported by psychological evidence and it is difficult to reconcile with the inter-
subjective agreement of several independent observers.(cid:148)

Conclusion (cid:150) Orthodoxy Becomes Heterodoxy 

Let us conclude with three remarks: on Wigner(cid:146)s self-awareness of the role he 

played in the foundations of quantum mechanics; on the success of his ideas and action; 

and on a very different question, anachronism in the history of science, which is not 

strange to the aim of this book.  Shimony had the insight to record Wigner(cid:146)s feelings 

about the attitudinal changes he underwent.  These changes may also help us understand 

changes in the Zeitgeist of physicists of the (cid:146)60s and (cid:146)70s with respect to the foundations 

of quantum mechanics.  Intending to defend what he considered to be the (cid:147)quantum 

orthodoxy,(cid:148) he in fact helped to legitimize heterodoxy on this subject, and he himself 

became a dissenter.  In Shimony(cid:146)s (1997: 412) words: (cid:147)Wigner recognized with some 

relish a similarity between the (cid:145)heterodox(cid:146) view that quantum mechanics is only 

approximate in the physical world and the (cid:145)orthodox(cid:146) view that a reduction of the wave 

packet occurs only when there is a registration upon the consciousness of an observer.(cid:148)  

Shimony concluded, citing Wigner: (cid:147)Both points of view come to the conclusion that the 

validity of quantum mechanics(cid:146) linear laws is limited.(cid:148) 

During the 1970s, the community working on the foundations of quantum 

mechanics was mainly occupied with another subject, Bell(cid:146)s inequalities and their 

experimental tests.  Wigner was not as interested in this subject as in measurement 

problems, but he continued to play an active role until his intellectual vigor began to fade.  

However, physicists continued to work on the measurement problem research program 

and, in the 1980s and 1990s, it matured into the decoherence approach with its first 

experimental results in 1996.  Where Wigner saw a role for the mind in quantum 

measurements, the contemporary trend looks for an exchange of information between the 

experimental devices and the environment (Zurek 1991; Haroche 1998).  Today, 

Wigner(cid:146)s conjecture about the role of the mind in the quantum measurement process is no 

longer part of physics, but rather part of the history of physics.  Nevertheless, the 

question persists, and from time to time, physicists devote some time to building 

technical arguments against it (Brandt 2002).  In contrast, Wigner(cid:146)s research program - to 

understand from a physical point of view what quantum measurement is - has flourished 

and is part of physics. Furthermore, in order to create this subfield of physics, 

foundations of quantum physics, it was necessary to break what Jammer called the 

1919

(cid:147)Copenhagen monocracy.(cid:148)  As stated by the French physicist Alain Aspect (2004), who 

is a leader in the field of foundations of quantum physics, and is not atall a critic of th 

complementarity view, (cid:147)questioning the (cid:145)orthodox(cid:146) views, including the famous 

Copenhagen interpretation, might lead to an improved understanding of the quantum 
mechanics formalism, even though that formalism remained impeccably accurate.(cid:148) 33 

Wigner made major contributions in achieving this goal.  

Finally, we can conclude that deprecating Wigner(cid:146)s contribution to the 

foundations of quantum mechanics constitutes an anachronistic reading of those events.  

Anachronism does not facilitate our understanding of how science really works because it 

yields to a distortion of real science.  The history of science, as a historical discipline, 

rectifies anachronistic readings of science because, according to Lucien Febvre (1982), 

historians should prevent the sin of all sins (cid:150) the unforgivable sin, anachronism.  

Historians know, however, the tension implied in such prevention, since Marc Bloch and 

Lucien Febvre, the creators of new perspectives to the historical disciplines, advocated 

that historians should ask questions of the past, and that these questions could be 

provoked by contemporary questions.  This tension is inherent in a discipline on its way 

to becoming a science, a science still in its infancy, as remarked by Bloch (1997). 

There is further significance in quoting Marc Bloch at the end of this paper, which 

is included in a book edited by Boaventura de Sousa Santos.  There are some parallelisms 

between Bloch(cid:146)s and Santos(cid:146)s intellectual dØmarches.  In (cid:147)A Discourse on the Sciences,(cid:148) 

Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2001) took into account what seemed to him to be lessons 

from the natural sciences in order to reflect on the changing paradigms of social sciences.  

Marc Bloch (1997), in a beautiful but unfinished essay about the historian(cid:146)s craft, written 

in Nazi prisons sometime before being killed on June 16, 1944, by order of Klaus Barbie, 

affirmed that our mental environment was not the same anymore.  Quantum physics, 

relativity theory, and the kinetic theory of gases soundly changed the idea we had formed 

                                                 
33 We have an impressive piece of evidence for the low status of research in foundations 
of quantum physics; just before the Wigner-Rosenfeld dispute, in J.S. Bell(cid:146)s remarks, 
first published in 1966: (cid:147)The minority view is as old as quantum mechanics itself, so the 
new theory may be a long time coming. [(cid:133)] We emphasize not only that our view is that 
of a minority, but also that current interest in such questions is small.  The typical 
physicist feels that they have long been answered, and that he will fully understand just 
how if ever he can spare twenty minutes to think about it(cid:148) (Bell, 1966).  I thank Osvaldo 
Pessoa for bringing this interesting excerpt to my attention.

about science, making it more flexible, he wrote.  Bloch added that we were then better 

prepared to admit that knowledge, like the historical, even without Euclidian proofs or 

immutable laws of repetition, could nevertheless aim to be named scientific.

Introduction 

Laser  linewidth  theory  was  pioneered  by  Schawlow  and  Townes  [1]  and  further 
developed  in  [2]  and  [3].  We  discuss  the  status  of  the  Schawlow-Townes-Lax-
Henry (STLH) theory of laser linewidth in the instance of semiconductor injection 
lasers.  At  injection  levels  I   below  threshold 
  one  can  introduce  two

spectra 
gain and the loss at cavity mirrors of the electromagnetic field intensity. The gain 
g ω   is  generally  an  increasing  function  of  I .  At

,  and  the  generation  begins.  The  STLH 

theory  of  laser  linewidth  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  in  the  mean-field 
approximation  (i.e.,  without  fluctuations)  the  singular  in  frequency  nature  of 
generation persists above the threshold (i.e., for 
) . In the framework of this 
approach, the laser line acquires a finite width  Γ  entirely due to fluctuations. In 
an  ideal  laser  these  fluctuations  are  due  to  the  random  discrete  nature  of 
spontaneous emission.

principle,  however,  scenarios  other  than  rigidity  are  also  possible.  For  example, 
the curves may touch each other for 
 in a finite interval of frequencies, see 
CI
Fig. 1c, so that there is a finite linewidth even in the mean-field approximation. In 
this case, the account of fluctuations would provide only a correction. This is not 
an  unusual  situation.  For  example,  the  conventional  mean-field  scenario  for 
multimode  laser  generation  (Fig.  1d)  involves  oscillations  at  several  discrete 
frequencies.

In this paper we examine the validity of the assumption of rigidity. In Sect. 2 
we  briefly  review  the  standard  STLH  linewidth  theory.  In  Sect.  3  we  derive  a 
mean-field  expression  for  the  linewidth  using  Boltzmann’s  kinetic  equation  for 
electrons  and  photons.  In  this  approach  the  linewidth  turns  out  to  an  increasing 
function  of  injection,  which  violates  the  assumption  of  rigidity  and  is  in 
contradiction with the STLH scenario. Curiously, however, it is not necessarily in 
contradiction with experiment, see the discussion in Sect. 4.

2.  Standard model of semiconductor laser 

The  simplest  model  of  the  laser  is  a  pumped  two-level  electronic  system, 
immersed in an electromagnetic wave resonator. It is described (see, e.g. [4]) by

.  Beyond  the  mean-field

approximation the quantities 
and ϕ fluctuate in time due to the randomness 
of recombination and relaxation processes. It is these fluctuations that determine 
the  linewidth  in  the  conventional  STLH  approach.  In  an  idealized  laser,  the 
fluctuations  arise  from  randomness  of  spontaneous  emission.  All  fluctuations  of 
interest, including spontaneous emission, can be described classically in the sense 
that they are generated by δ-correlated Langevin forces (white noise). The reason 
for the classical description of fluctuations is that the time scale we are interested 
in (of order the inverse linewidth) is long compared to all kinetic relaxation times.

Fluctuations Nδ and nδ  give rise to the intensity noise, while only fluctuations of

We  would  like  to  stress  that  the  STLH  approach  essentially  relies  on  the 
assumption that the mean-field equations have a singular solution with no width at 
all.  Discussion  of  this  assumption  requires  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  injection-
g ω ,  which  in  turn  requires  a  consideration  of  energy  and 
level  dependence 
frequency  dependences  of  the  electron  and  photon  distributions,  εn and ωN , 
respectively.  In  Sect.  3  we  discuss  such  a  description  based  on  Boltzmann’s 
kinetic  equation.  It  turns  out  that  singular  solutions  are  ruled  out  in  the  kinetic 
description  which  yields  a  finite  laser  linewidth  already  in  the  absence  of 
fluctuations.

1The  precise  meaning  of  the  spontaneous  emission  rate  is  unclear  in  this  model.  The 
question  is  what  is  the  spectral  width  for  spontaneous  emission  events  that  appear  in  the 
derivation of Eq. (2)?  For example, in some scenarios one may take into account only the 
spontaneous emission into the linewidth  Γ  itself, in which case the power of the pumping 
intensity in Eq. (2) would be different.

The reason for this is that

According to Eq. (3b), in a stationary state (

We  see  that  the  linewidth  in  the  mean-field  approximation  increases  with 
pumping.  This is in drastic contradiction with the conventional STLH result (2) 
that predicts a linewidth decreasing with  I . 

The fundamental reason for this discrepancy is the assumption by STLH of a

of fluctuations. In contrast, the solutions of kinetic equations are smooth functions 
of  ε  and  ω  and  do  not  exhibit  any  singularity.  Consequently,  an  account  of 
fluctuations would make only a small correction to our result.   

4.  Discussion 

It should be cautioned that validity of kinetic equations (3) requires that the 
uncertainty in electronic energies due to collisions be smaller than the interval of 
). According to Eq. (11), 
electronic energies that we are interested in (

this  condition  is  satisfied  at  sufficiently  high  injection  intensities.  However, 
semiconductor  lasers  at  room  temperature  are  typically  in  the  opposite  regime 
.  In  this  regime  we  are  concerned  with  the  details  of  the  electron 
eeτ/1
distribution function resolved on a much finer scale than that on which the single 
electronic states themselves are well defined. We are not aware of any example in 
kinetic  theory  where  a  quantitative  description  of  such  a  situation  has  been 
developed.  Its  qualitative  physical  aspects  can  to  some  extent  be  captured  in  a 
model that relaxes the strict energy conservation in single-electron transitions,

Although  this  model  will  give  a  somewhat  different  expression  for  the 
linewidth  compared  to  Eq.  (11),  it  is  clear  that  Γ   will  remain  an  increasing 
function of  I .

Available  experiments  lend  conclusive  support  neither  to  our  result  nor 
STLH. At low intensities above threshold one observes a decreasing linewidth but 
at  higher  intensities  the  linewidth  often  saturates  and  then  re-broadens,  so  that 
 exhibits a minimum (see, e.g., Fig. 6.15 in [5], Fig. 9.11 in [6], or the more 
)(IΓ
recent  data  [7]).  One  of  the  possible  scenarios  that  would  reconcile  the  two 
pictures  is  that  at  low  injection,  the  mean-field  linewidth  given  by  the  kinetic 
equation approach happens to be much smaller than the STLH linewidth given by 
(2), i.e. 
 at least near threshold. In this case, the initial decrease of 
the linewidth with  I could be attributed to a STLH-like mechanism, whereas for 
larger I the increasing mean-field linewidth takes over and one has re-broadening.  
In  the  opposite  limit,  which  we  find  more  realistic,  there  is  no  range  for 
STLH to hold and we would have to conclude that the decreasing linewidth lacks 
theoretical  explanation.  Development  of  a  satisfactory  linewidth  theory  would 
then  require  inclusion  of  additional  phenomena  that  go  beyond  the  kinetic 
description. We would like to mention here two such phenomena:

rate, should be replaced by a term proportional to

exhibiting  beatings  in 

When the electric field is monochromatic, these two expressions are identical, and 
we come back to Eq.(3a). However, for a finite frequency range, Eq. (13) leads to 
beatings  between  different  frequency  components  of  the  field.  With  the  electron 
concentration
time  the  problem  becomes  non-
stationary  and  highly  nonlinear.  This  applies  both  to  the  case  of  frequency-
distributed field within a single mode and to the multimode case. In the latter case 
a  related  problem  arises:  the  dependence  of  the  number  of  lasing  modes  on  the 
pumping  intensity.  This  dependence  is  often  nonmonotonic,  increasing  at  small 
I and  decreasing  at  large  I .  In  a  broad  sense,  it  could  be  interpreted  as  a 
narrowing  of  the  total  spectral  width  of  laser  oscillations.  An  attempt  has  been 
made  [8]  to  explain  this  phenomenon  by  a  mode  competition  generated  by  the 
term in Eq. (13). As far as we know, however, this problem remains unsolved.       

(b)  Different  harmonics  of 

lasing  radiation  have  different  spatial 
dependencies. The electron recombination rate depends on the local amplitude of 
the  electromagnetic  field.  Thus,  different  harmonics  of  the  electromagnetic  field 
 due to 
can compete via the spatial dependence of the electron concentration 
the spatial hole burning. As far as we know, the significance of this effect for the 
laser line width has not been elucidated.

5.  Conclusion 

We  see  that  the  standard  theory  of  laser  linewidth  is  unsatisfactory.  The  theory 
attributes  the  spectral  width  of  laser  oscillation  to  fluctuations  brought  about  by 
random  spontaneous  emission  events  and  is  essentially  based  on  the  assumption 
that  in  the  absence  of  fluctuation  laser  radiation  is  monochromatic.  We  have 
shown  that  this  assumption  is  inconsistent  and  that  already  in  the  mean  field 
model  the  laser  oscillations  have  a  finite  spectral  linewidth  that  furthermore 
increases with pumping. 

Our consideration was restricted to semiconductor lasers but our conclusion 
is likely to be more general, applicable to other lasers as well, such as solid-state 
lasers  and  gas  lasers.  The  question  of  why  the  laser  linewidth  can  be  much 
narrower  than  either  the  gain  spectrum  or  the  resonator  linewidth  is  begging  a 
theoretical explanation.

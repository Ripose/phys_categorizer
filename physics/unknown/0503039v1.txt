Abstract 
 

A  planar  near-field  magnetoinductive  lens  operating  in  the  microwave  range  is 

presented.  The  proposed  device  consists  of  two  parallel  planar  arrays  of  metallic 

broadside coupled (BC-) split ring resonators (SRRs), or BC-SRRs. Power coming from 

a point-like source located in front of the lens is focused into a receiver located in free 

space behind the device. This focus is clearly removed from the back side of the lens, 

and has a size which is an order of magnitude smaller than the free space wavelength of 

the  incoming  radiation.  The  imaging  properties  of  the  device  mainly  relies  on  the 

excitation of magnetoinductive surface waves on the BC-SRR arrays. By simply scaling 

the BC-SRRs  size, as well as the arrays periodicity, the frequency of operation of the 

device  can  be  tuned  over  a  wide  frequency  range.  Thus  the  proposed  design  is 

potentially useful for many applications ranging from megahertzs to terahertzs.

After  the  seminal  papers  of  Veselago  [1]  and  Pendry  [2]  on  the  imaging 

properties  of  left-handed  slabs,  there  has  been  a  great  deal  of  interest  on  this  subject, 

including the design of sub-diffraction imaging devices [2]. In fact, lenses overcoming 

diffraction  limits  could  find  application  not  only  in  imaging  devices,  but  also  in  the 

recording  of  information,  microwave  heating  and  many  other  technological  areas. 

However, it soon becames apparent that losses and dispersion – both unavoidable in any 

practical  left-handed  material  –  would  strongly  limit  in  practice  the  performances  of 

these  devices  [3-5].  In  particular,  losses  will  prevent  subwavelength  imaging  at 

distances  higher  than  a  small  number  of  wavelengths  in  any  practical  lens  [4,5]. 

Therefore,  attention  will  soon  focus  in  the  near-field  imaging  of  electromagnetic 

signals.  A  way  to  obtain  quasi-perfect  imaging  in  the  quasi-electrostatic  limit  is  by 

using  a  slab  of  negative  dielectric  permitivitty  ((cid:1))  [2].  Since  many  metals  show  this 

property  at  optical  frequencies,  thin  metallic  slabs  could  be  good  candidates  for 

obtaining  near-field  subwavelength  imaging  at  these  frequencies.  Quasi-perfect  near-

field  imaging  can  be  also  obtained  by  using  magnetized  ferrite  slabs  operating  in  the 

microwave  range  [6].  It  should  be  emphasized  that  these  two  last  proposals  are  only 

theoretical and have not been experimentally confirmed until present.  

Regarding  practical  realizations  of  subdiffraction  imaging  devices,  they  are 

presently  restricted  to  the  microwave  range  [7,8],  making  use  of  planar  circuit 

analogous of left-handed media [7] or of very thin (single-cell depth) highly anisotropic 

left-handed slabs in free space [8]. The first realization [7] seems not to open the way to 

any  possible  generalization  leading  to  three-dimensional  practical  lenses.  The  second 

one, apart from being highly anisotropic, does not enable to reproduce images “of finite 

depth” [8], the imaging being restricted to planes parallel to the lens. Microwave three-

 

 

2

dimensional imaging was already reported in [9], although the size of the focus was not 

of sub-wavelength dimensions. Thus, it can be concluded that devices producing three-

dimensional isotropic sub-wavelength imaging have not been reported before. 

In this letter we present a planar magnetoinductive lens for near-field imaging in 

the  microwave  range.  As  in  previous  works  [2,6-8],  the  key  concept  of  the  proposed 

imaging  process  is  the  amplification,  inside  the  lens,  of  the  evanescent  Fourier 

harmonics (FHs) coming from the source. This amplification produces the restoration of 

the amplitude of  each  FH at the image plane so that  the source field is reproduced at 

this  plane.  In  negative-(cid:1)  imaging  devices  [2]  and  in  magnetized  ferrite  slabs  [6],  this 

amplification is due to the excitation of surface waves (surface plasmons in metals and 

magnetostatic  surface  waves  in  ferrites)  at  the  shadowed  interface  of  the  slab.    These 

surface waves, which decay from this interface towards both the source and the image, 

are coupled to the decaying evanescent FHs coming from the source, in such a way that 

the  amplitude  of  these  FHs  is  restored  at  the  image  plane  [2,6].  This  mechanism  is 

sketched  in  Fig.1.a,  where  the  decaying–growing–decaying  process  is  illustrated  for  a 

single  FH.  Recently  a  similar  mechanism  of  amplification  of  evanescent  modes  has 

been  reported  in  a  pair  of  coupled  resonator  arrays  [10].  To  achieve  ideal  perfect 

imaging, this process should take place for all the FH coming from the source. Since the 

lens  operates  at  a  single  frequency,  this  implies  that  the  dispersion  relation  for  the 

surface waves at the shadowed interface of the lens (the plane z=0 in Fig.1.a), should be 

very  flat,  so  that  surface  waves  corresponding  to  whatever  value  of  the  wavevectors 

(kx,ky) can be simultaneously excited at the frequency of operation of the lens [2,6,10]. 

This  condition  is  in  fact  fullfilled  by  the  ideal  surface  plasmons  supported  by  a 

 

 

3

negative-(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)slab  interface  [2].  It  is  also  fullfilled  by  the  magnetostatic  surface  waves 

supported by a magnetized ferrite slab interface [6]. 

In the proposed device (see Fig.2), magnetoinductive surface waves are excited 

at  the  shadowed  lens  interface.  Magnetoinductive  waves  were  first  reported  by 

Shamonina et al. [11] in both one- and two-dimensional arrays of split rings resonators 

(SRRs).  Magnetoinductive  waves  are  produced  by  the  inductive  coupling  between 

SRRs, due to the strong magnetic dipoles induced at each resonator near its resonance. 

Magnetoinductive waves behave as quasi-magnetostatic surface waves in many aspects, 

as  it  was  noted  in  [12].  The  dispersion  relation  for  a  planar  square  array  of  SRRs  as 

those shown in Fig.2  can be written as [11,12]

taken into account.  In (1) L and M accounts for the SRRs self-inductance and mutual

where  (cid:2)(cid:3)  is  the  bandwidth  of  excitation of  the magnetoinductive surface waves. This 

bandwidth  is  very  small,  of  the  order  of  a  10%  in  the  configuration  shown  in  Fig.2. 

Therefore,  magnetoinductive  waves  fullfill  very  approximately  the  aforementioned 

condition  of  having  a  “flat”  dispersion  relation,  which  is  needed  for  subwavelength 

imaging.  Since  magnetoinductive  waves  are  quasi-magnetostatic  waves,  the  magnetic 

field,  H,  can  be  obtained  from  the  quasi-static  magnetic  potential(cid:3)m:  H  =  -grad(cid:3)m,.

The  magnetostatic  potential  satisfies  Laplace’s  equation  in  free  space.  Thus,  the  z-

dependence  for  the  magnetoinductive  waves  that  can  be  excited  at  the  SRR  square 

arrays  is  of  the  kind  (cid:3)m(cid:1)(cid:6)kx,ky,z)  =  (cid:3)m,(cid:1)(cid:1)exp(-k(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:1)where  (cid:3)m,(cid:1)(cid:1)  is  a  constant, 

k=(kx

2)1/2, and (cid:4) is the distance to the SRR array. Regarding the behavior of (cid:3)m near 

the  SRR  array,  it  differs  from  that  of  the  surface  plasmons  and  ferrite  magnetostatic 

potentials  [2,6].  On  the  one  hand,  the  magnetostatic  potential  (cid:3)m  should  experience  a 

discontinuity  at  each  lens  interface,  equal  to  the  mean  magnetic  dipole  moment  per 

square meter: (cid:2)(cid:3)m (cid:9)(cid:1)N<mz> (<mz> is the average magnetic dipole of the SRRs and N is 

the number of SRRs per square meter). On the other hand, the normal component of the 

magnetic field, Hz, should be continuous across these interfaces. The behavior of (cid:3)m for 

the  considered  magnetoinductive  surface  waves  is  sketched  in  Fig.1.b.  Although  this 

behavior differs from that reported in [2] and [6] for the surface plasmons and for the 

magnetostatic  surface  waves,  respectively,  it  still  can produce FHs amplification. This 

amplification mechanism is sketched in Fig.1.b (it is worth noting that, if the absolute 

values  of  the  magnetostatic  potential  were  plotted,  this  graphic  will  be  identical  to 

Fig.1.a). In Figs. 1.a and 1.b, it can be seen how a single FH coming from the source (at 

z= -3d/2) is coupled to a surface wave excited at the shadowed lens interface (at z=0), 

and how its amplitude is finally restored at the focus plane (z=d/2). It is worth to note 

that  the  potential  behavior  at  both  sides  of  z=-d  reproduces  that  of  the  companion 

mathematical solution of the surface wave generated at z=0. For an isolated SRR array 

this solution will be non-physical, since the magnetostatic potential will grow to infinity 

at both sides of the array. However, the presence of the source at z=-3d/2, as well as that 

of the companion SRR array at z=0, allows for the excitation of this field configuration 

around the SRR array at z=-d.

Fig. 2 shows the practical device analyzed in this paper. The lens consists of two 

parallel  square  arrays  of  SRRs  separated  by  a  distance  d  (a  layer  of  RohacellTM  foam 

was  placed  between  the  layers  containing  the  arrays  in  order  to  provide  mechanical 

stability). Broadside coupled SRRs (BC-SRRs) are used instead of conventional SRRs 

in  order  to  avoid  cross-polarization  effects,  and  to  reduce  the  electrical  size  of  the 

resonators [13]. The BC-SRRs are photo-etched on a dielectric substrate of thickness h, 

as  it  is  shown  in  the  inset  of  Fig.2.  Two  square  loop  antennas  are  used  as  source and 

receiver,  respectively.  These  square  loops  are  also  fabricated  by  photo-etching  a 

metallic pattern on a dielectric substrate. The size of these loops is taken equal to four 

times  the  unit  cell  area  of  the  BC-SRRs  array,  in  order  to  average  the  detailed 

contribution to the total field coming from each individual resonator. The input antenna 

(the source) is fixed at a distance d/2 from the lens; the output antenna is scanned in the 

y-z  plane  in  order  to  search  for  the  image  of  the  input  antenna.  Fig.3.a  shows  the 

measured transmission coefficient between both antennas when the lens is present, and 

Fig.3.b  shows  this  measurement  when  the  lens  is  removed.  Fig.3.a  shows  clearly  that 

the transmitted power has a maximum at a distance d/2 of the shadowed interface of the 

lens,  i.e.,  at  a  distance  2d  of  the  the  input  antenna,  in  agreement  with  the  proposed 

theory. Nothing similar is observed when the lens is absent. The half intensity width of 

the aforementioned maximum is around 10 mm in the lateral direction (y axis), and less 

than 2 mm in the perpendicular one (z axis). These distances are smaller than the free 

space wavelength at the operating frequency (about 100 mm) by an order of magnitude. 

The  intensity  of  the  maximun  is  indeed  remarkable,  since  it  is  an  order  of  magnitud 

higher than the intensity at the same point when the lens is removed. A noticeable fact is 

that the reported maximum is clearly removed from the lens shadowed interface. Thus, 

a  three-dimensional  sub-wavelength  image  of  the  source  is  obtained.  The  slight 

 

6

asymmetries  of  the  field  patterns shown in Fig.3 can be attributed to tolerances in the 

lens  fabrication  process,  or  in  the  positioning  device  used  for  scanning  the  output 

antenna.  

 

In  summary,  subwavelength  microwave  three-dimensional  imaging  by  a  flat 

magnetoinductive  microwave  lens  has  been  shown.  The  reported  image  has  a  sub-

wavelength size, which is in agreement with the “perfect lens” theory [2], and is clearly 

removed from the edge of the lens. To the best of our knowledge, a similar result has 

not been reported before for any three-dimensional device. An advantage of the reported 

device  over  previous  near-field  lens  designs  is  the  simplicity  of  its  manufacturing 

process,  which  mainly  consists  on  etching  two  planar  metallic  patterns  on  a 

conventional  circuit  board,  by  means  of  standard  microwave  circuit  manufacturing 

techniques.  For  these  reasons,  we  feel  that  the  reported  concepts  can  substantially 

improve  present  approaches  to  electromagnetic  imaging  devices.  Since  BC-SRRs  are 

metallic resonators with a linear response, whose frequency of resonance can be tuned 

by simply scaling them in space, the frequency of operation of the proposed device can 

be also tuned over a broad frequency range. This frequency range will be mainly limited 

by the usefulness of the SRR topology as a practical magnetic resonator design. Since 

this usefulnes seems to have been actually demonstrated until the terahertz range [14], 

the  limits  of  application  of  the  proposed  design  would  also  extend  at  least  to  these 

frequencies. In addition to its theoretical interest, devices based on the reported concepts 

can find practical applications in many technological areas, such as microwave imaging 

or heating, for industrial and health applications.

FIG.  2.  Experimental  setup  for  the  measurement  of  the  reported  magnetoinductive 

microwave  lens.  The  lens  consists  of  two  parallel  square  planar  dielectric  substrates 

with an area of 7x7 cm2, separated by a foam slab of thickness d=4mm. A periodic two-

dimensional array of broadside coupled split rings resonators (BC-SRRs) is photoetched 

on the two interfaces of each substrate. The square inset in the figure shows in detail the 

geometry of the BC-SRR, which has an outer radius r=2mm and a ring width w=0.5mm. 

The  periodicity  of  the  array  is  5mm.  The  dielectric  substrate  is  alumina,  which  is 

commonly  used  in  microwave  circuits,  with  thickness  h=0.254mm  and  dielectric 

permittivity (cid:1)r=10. An input antenna and a receiving antenna are placed at the opposite 

sides  of  the  lens.  Both  antennas  are  squared  loops  with  an  area  of  1x1cm2  and  are 

fabricated by photoetching a metallic pattern on an low permitivity substrate. The input 

antenna is fixed at a certain distance from the left interface of the lens and the receiving 

antenna can be scanned along the Y-Z directions shown in the figure.   

FIG.  3.  Experimental  results  obtained  with  the  setup  shown  in  Fig.  2.  The  data  are 

referred  to  the  modulus  of  the  transmission  coefficient  between  the  input  antenna  and 

10

the  receiving  antenna  with  the  lens  (a)  and  without  it  (b).  The  measurements  were 

carried out by using a Vector Network Analyzer HP 8510 B. The input antenna is fixed 

at a distance of 2mm from the left interface of the lens (the location of the left interface 

corresponds  to  z=-3d/2  in  Fig.  1.b)  and  its  operating  frequency  is  3.23GHz.  The 

receiving antenna is scanned along the Y-Z directions shown at the right side of the lens 

in  Fig.  2.  Note  that  in  Fig.  3.a  the  image  is  formed  at  the  point  y=0mm,  z=2.25mm 

(z=d/2  in  Fig.  1.b),  i.e.,  at  a  distance  of  2.25  mm  from  the  right  interface  of  the  lens. 

This  distance  agrees  very  approximately  with  the  halfwidth  of  the  lens,  i.e.,  with  the 

sum  of  the  foam  halfwidth  (2  mm)  and  the  microwave  board  thickness  (0.254  mm). 

Therefore,  the  image  formation  obeys  the  proposed  theory.  Note  that  in  Fig.  3.b.  the 

modulus of the transmission coefficient in the point y=0mm, z=2.25mm in the absence 

of the lens is one order of magnitude lower than in the same point in the presence of the 

lens.

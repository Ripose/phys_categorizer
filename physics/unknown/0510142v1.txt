Recently Hirsch [1,2] has proposed a new scalar index h to quantify individual's 

scientific  research  impact.  A  researcher  with  index  h  has  h  papers  with  at  least  h 

citations.  This  index  has  several  advantages:  (i)  it  combines  productivity  with  impact, 

(ii) the  necessary data  is easy to access at the Thomson ISI Web of Science database, 

(iii)  it  is  not sensitive to extreme  values, (iv)  it  is hard to inflate. However, this  index 

remains sensitive to the research  field. It is even difficult to compare researchers  from 

different  areas  within  a  given  discipline.  Further,  since  h  is  an  integer  number,  many 

researchers may have the same index h, so that discriminating or listing them demands 

further indexes.  

The  number of authors correlates positively with  the number of citations that a 

paper receives  in a given time  interval [3]. It is also reasonable to assume that the co-

authorship behavior is characteristic of each discipline. Here we propose a new index hI 

which deals with these issues in a robust way [4]. The statistics of h and hI  are presented 

for  the  fundamental  research  fields  in  Brazil.  The  relatively  small  size  of  this 

community enabled us to do a complete index statistics. 

From  Thomson  ISI  Web  of  Science,  we  have  compiled  a  database  of  the 

Brazilian 

scientific 

research 

in 

four  different 

fields:  Physics,  Chemistry, 

Biology/Biomedics and Mathematics. The research has been conducted using the query 

“Brazil OR Brasil” in the address field, considering all documents published from 1945 

up  to  2004.  Our  database  contains  information  of  about  188,909  bibliographical 

references (additional information is available in the supplementary material). 

To account for co-authorship, divide h by the mean number of researchers in the 

h  publications:  <Na>  =  Na

(T)  /  h  where  Na

(T)

    is  the  total  number  of  authors  (author 

multiple occurrences are allowed) in the considered h papers, leading to: 

h

(cid:1)

Nh
(cid:3)

(1) 

which gives additional  information about the research relevance. The rationale  for this 

procedure is that we want to measure the average individual productivity. Further, more 

authors could produce more future self-citations which may inflate the statistics. Once h 

has been computed, the hI index is also easy to be obtained. The rank plots of hI and h 

(Fig. 1-A and inset, respectively) for the brazilian scientific community present different 

behavior.  In  contrast  to  the  h  curves,  the  hI  curves  are  smoother  and  have  the  same 

functional  shape  for all disciplines. We  have  found that biologists have smaller h than 

physicists in Brazil, contrasting to Hirsch's observations about worldwide data [1]. This 

may  be  due  to  the  lack  of  financial  support  to  sustain  the  experimental  nature  of 

Biology, in Brazil.  

We  have  also  calculated  the  h  and  hI  for  the  top  ten  physicists  and  biologists 

listed  in [1]. Contrasting to the h averages, the average of hI for both areas are similar 

and the maximum values of hI are closer than h maximum values (data available on the 

supplementary information). 

The  index  hI  is  complementary  to  h.  It  lifts  the  h  degenerescency  and  has  the 

advantage of  being  less  sensitive to different research  fields. This  allows a  less  biased 

comparison due to the consideration of co-authorship. However, the use of the mean in 

hI  index  could  penalize  authors  with  eventual  papers  with  large  co-authorship.  A 

possible correction to this factor (a little bit harder to obtain) is to consider the median 

instead of the mean value.  

The  fundamental  result  of  this  communication  is  that  there  is  a  universal 

behavior  for  the    relative  index  hI  /<hI>  as  a  function  of  the  relative  rank  R/Rmax  as 

shown in Fig.1-b, where  <hI> and rank maximum are relative to each curve. One can 

see the data colapse into a single universal curve approached by a stretched exponential 

[5]. This is not observed for the relative h index (Fig.1-B inset). This universal behavior 

allows comparisons among different fields.

UNIVERSAL BEHAVIOR OF A RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY INDEX

(supplementary material) 

We have created the Brazilian Science Indicators (BSI) database from Thomson 

ISI Web of Science database. We have considered all documents published from 1945 

up  to  2004.    The  search  was  performed  separately  for  each  year.  The  choose  for  the 

Brazilian community in this work is due to the fact that the ISI Web of Science limits 

the searching in 100,000 papers, being thus impossible to compile a complete database 

for countries that have a greater annual productivity as the USA. Our database contains 

information  about  188,909  bibliographical  references  which 

includes  kind  of 

publication,  full reference, citations received  yearly (up to June 2005), authors´  names 

and  addresses,  including  the  institutions,  cities,  states  and  country.  Among  all 

publications, we have considered only 150,323 articles, 24,164 meeting abstracts, 5,541 

notes,  3,577  letters  and  2,333  reviews.  These  documents  have  been  classified  into  the 

following  research  fields:  Physics,  Chemistry,  Biology/Biomedics  and  Mathematics 

using the tag subject of each document.  

 

To further examine the robustness of our index, we have calculated hI for the top 

ten scientists listed by Hirsch [1] in physics and in life sciences. The results are listed in 

table 1. As stated by [1], the mean h values for both disciplines are strongly different, as 

well  as  the  maximum  h  values,  reflecting  the  differences  between  the  research  areas. 

This  difference  is  also  markedly  reflected  in  the  co-authorship  patterns  for  both  the 

areas. In fact, we have found a strong correlation between the rank curves for these top 

scientists,  with  NBio  ~  2NPhys  (data  not  shown)  and  we  conjecture  that  this  correlation 

occurs for the rest of these communities. Thus when we normalize by the number of co-

authors, the new index hI presents similar mean and maximum values as can be seen in 

Table 1.

Table 1: Top ten scientists listed in [1] for physics and life sciences. The h indexes have 

been  computed  in  the  ISI  Web  of  Science  querying  by  the  authors’  names  as  written 

above. For the hI we have calculated the mean number of authors in the h papers <Na>. 

This new index is calculated as hI  = h/<Na>. Mean and standard deviation are presented 

for each index.

Abstract- We study the light propagation in one-dimensional photonic crystal via nonlinear Four Wave Mixing 
(FWM) process. The linear and nonlinear refractive indexes are approximated with the first Fourier harmonic 
term. A system of the nonlinear coupled mode equations (NLCMEs), including pump fields depletion is derived 
for FWM process and steady state analysis is presented numerically. Also some of important system parameters' 
effects on FWM process are investigated. It has been shown that, although we have considered pump depletion

I. Introduction- Parametric interactions in nonlinear periodic structures play an important role in all-
optical networks. Four Wave Mixing process is one of these interactions which has long been studied 
[1-3].  Recently,  FWM  process  is  used  in  interesting  areas  of  quantum  information  technology  to 
generate single and entangled photons via nonlinear photonic crystals [4-6]. 
In  most  of  these  crystals  polarization  of  photons  is  used  to  generate  entangled  photon  pairs  via 
parametric interactions such as FWM. 
These crystals include BBO and GaAs bulk materials, but since the nonlinear susceptibility of GaAs 
is  much  greater  than  BBO  crystals,  which  affect  the  conversion  efficiency  of  FWM  process,  GaAs 
crystals  are  widely  used  in  quantum  optics  areas  of  research,  but  because  of  lack  of  birefringence, 
phase matching condition is not satisfied easily, so in order to obtain phase matching condition easily, 
nonlinear photonic crystals are used instead of bulk GaAs. 
FWM is really a photon-photon scattering process, during which two photons from a relatively high-
intensity  beam,  called  pump  beams  scatter  through  third  order   
 nonlinearity  of  a  material  to 
generate two correlated photons called signal and idler photons respectively [3, 7, 8]. In homogeneous 
nonlinear media (such as bulk material), efficient exchange of energy between interacting modes of 
the electromagnetic field is determined by the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities of the medium. So, 
successful achievement of the proposed applications strongly depends on the nonlinearity strength and 
the  medium  structure.  But  these  materials  suffer  from  several  problems  which  some  of  them  are 
mentioned below: 
1. 
2. Wavelengths of signal and idler photons are close to pump wavelengths. 
3. In the case of small conversion efficiency, even small amounts of pump beam scattering generates 
large background count rates that mask the detection of correlations between signal and idler photons. 
(on the other hand scattering of the pump fields tends to mask the desired quantum effects).  

nonlinearity is usually small compared to

 nonlinear  optical  materials  can  be  eliminated  by  using 
Many  of  the  problems  associated  with 
suitable  structures  such  as  single  mode  optical  fibers.  These  optical  fibers  have  extremely  low  loss, 
small confinement cross section and can be as long as several kilometers. The nonlinearity is an off-
 Kerr effect with an ultra fast frequency response extending from dc to well above 10 
resonance 
THz. Although weak, it can give rise to very large nonlinear effect in long fibers.  
It  is  obvious  that  the  material’s  permittivity  determines  how  phase  matched  is  a  given  parametric 
process,  whereas  the  actual  coupling  of  energy  between  the  modes  is  a  function  of  the  material’s 
nonlinear  polarizability.  In  an  attempt  to  circumvent  material  constraints  (second  alternative),  much 
works have been focused on the possibility of using periodic media to mediate nonlinear processes. 
Some  of  basic  important  works  proposed  the  introduction  of  periodic  structure  into  the  linear  and 
nonlinear material properties to aid in phase matching parametric interactions [6, 9-12].  
The introduction of the periodic nonlinear modulation leads to both flexibility in phase matching and 
also  makes  accessible  a  material’s  largest  nonlinear  coefficient.  It  has  been  shown  that  periodic 
modulation of a nonlinear material’s refractive index can lead to enhanced conversion efficiencies in 
parametric processes. 
Photonic crystals were first conceived by John and Yablonovitch [13, 14], and have been widely used 
in all fields of optics, so especial arrangement of linear and nonlinear index of refraction can help us 
to modify the conversion efficiency of FWM process.  
In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  complete  set  of  coupled  wave  equations  describing  FWM  in  one-
dimensional  nonlinear  photonic  crystal  for  the  first  time.  The  derived  relations  include  all  system 
parameters and input status. Our consideration concentrate on 
 which is interesting for optical 
communication.  Also,  the  proposed  periodic  structure  can  be  imagined  as  nonlinear  fiber  Bragg 
Grating.  After  derivation  of  the  coupled  wave  equations  for  all  field  components  (forward  and 
backward  components),  numerical  methods  have  been  used  to  simulate  of  the  process.  Simulation 
results for conversion efficiency are presented both for co-propagating and counter-propagating signal 
fields. Also, we try to enhance conversion efficiencies using FWM process.  
This paper is organized as follows: 
In  section  (II)  mathematical  model  and  derivation  of  FWM  process  in  one  dimensional  photonic 
crystal is discussed. Section (III) includes numerical evaluation of equations and some of important 
system parameters' effects on FWM process are investigated. Finally this paper ends with summary of 
the work and conclusion in section (IV). 
 
II.  Mathematical  Model- We now present a mathematical model for FWM process in 1D photonic 
crystal. Schematic sketch of a nonlinear photonic crystal for modeling FWM process is illustrated in 
Fig(1).

E are  the  average  refractive  index  of  crystal,  the  first  harmonic

coefficient  of  Fourier  expansion  for  the  nonlinear  index  of  refraction  and  the  applied  electric  field, 
respectively.  Re.  (1)  stands  that  both  linear  and  nonlinear  components  of    the  refractive  index  are 
chosen periodic as  shown in Fig (2).

III.  Simulation  Results  and  Discussion-  In  this  section  we  present  some  of  numerical  results  for 
both co-propagating and counter-propagating efficiencies in FWM process. 
Our  simulations  show  that  the  co-propagating  efficiency  is  larger  than  the  counter-propagating 
efficiency;  this  is  due  to  the  basic  principles  of  energy  transfer  between  forward  and  backward 
propagating modes in Brag gratings.  
Fig  (3)  shows  the  effect  of  number  of periods  on  co-propagation  conversion  efficiency. Conversion 
efficiency is decreased by decreasing of the nonlinear refractive index coefficient. As it is shown in 
Fig (3) we have increased the layers f crystal up to 600 layers, in simulation process we observed that 
by choosing the number of layers to more than 600 layers, co-propagating efficiency has oscillatory 
behavior, so it is necessary to keep in mind that the conversion efficiency is nonlinearly dependant on 
the number of periods and this subject should be considered in design process of a photonic crystal to 
avoid decreasing of the conversion efficiency.

Fig  (4)  illustrates  the  effect  of  phase  mismatch  between  wave  vectors  of  four  optical  fields  (two 
pumps,  signal  and  idler  fields)  on  conversion  efficiency.  It  is  shown  that  by  increasing  of  phase 
mismatch,  the  conversion  efficiency  is  decreased,  due  to  the  weak  energy  transfer  between 
propagating modes in this case.

Figs  (5,  6)  demonstrate  the  effect  of  phase  mismatch  between  the  average  wave  vector  of  optical 
fields and Grating wave vector on the conversion efficiency, as δ increases the conversion efficiency 
decreases. So in order to obtain high efficiencies in Bragg gratings, δ should be considered as small 
as  possible.  Also  careful  choice  of  number  of  layers  is  important  due  to  the  nonlinear  dependence 
between number of layers and the conversion efficiency.

Fig (10) and (11) illustrate the effect of nonlinear refractive index's coefficient in different number of 
layers, on the counter-propagation conversion efficiency.  
Conversion  efficiency  decreases  by  decreasing  of  the  nonlinear  refractive  index's  coefficient  (
). 
FWM phenomenon is strongly affected by the nonlinear refractive index's coefficient and this effect 
has been shown in our numerical simulations.  
Also, as we mentioned before, since the conversion efficiency is nonlinearly dependant on the number 
of periods, it is decreased when we choose more layers than 600 layers, so it is necessary to keep in 
mind this subject in design of a photonic crystal to avoid decreasing of the conversion efficiency.

Summary  and  Conclusion-  The  coupled  mode  equations  for  light  propagation  through  one-
dimensional  nonlinear  photonic  crystals  using  FWM  process  have  been  derived  and  steady  state 
numerical  results  have  been  discussed.  We  have  considered  the  Bragg  as  a  lossless  and 
inhomogeneous medium. The linear and nonlinear refractive indexes are approximated with the first 
Fourier harmonic term. 
It  has  been  shown  that  although  have  considered  that  all  the  fields  deplete  via  propagating  in  1D 
photonic crystal and we have used a medium with 
 nonlinearity, an enhancement of at least 100 
times  in  both  co-propagating  and  counter-propagating  efficiencies  have  been  observed  compared  to 
the previous works that use undepleted pump fields and 
As to our knowledge this is the first time that NCMEs are derived via 1D nonlinear photonic crystal 
using the following cases:

[15] 

1.  We have used continuous wave frequency not short pulse case. 
2.  All  fields  (pump,  signal  and  idler  fields)  are  affected  by  Bragg  grating,  so  both  SPM  and 

XPM phenomena are observed in Eqs.(9)-(23). 

3.  Pump depletion have been considered. 
4.  Both linear and nonlinear refractive of indexes are periodic. 
5.  In simulation processes both backward and forward components of the fields have been taken 

into account and none of them have been neglected.

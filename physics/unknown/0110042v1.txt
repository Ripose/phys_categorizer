Abstract. Gravitational radiation is an elusive form of radiation predicted by general relativity, it is the
subject  of  intense  theoretical  and  experimental  research  at  the  limit  of  the  sensitivity  of  today’s
instrumentation.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  no  direct  evidence  of  this  radiation  now  exist,  observed
astrophysical phenomena have given convincing proofs of its existence. Theories predict that gravitational
radiation may also be employed for propulsion, moreover the nonlinear behaviour of spacetime may permit
the generation of spacetime singularities with colliding beams of gravitational radiation, this phenomenon
could  become  a  form  of  propellantless  propulsion.  Both  applications  would  require  gravitational  wave
generators with high power and appropriate optical properties. Among the proposed techniques that could
be applicable to the production of gravitational waves, a promising one is the possible emission of gravitons
by quantum systems. A hypothesis describing the production of gravitons in s-wave/d-wave superconductor
junction is presented.

INTRODUCTION

Everybody  can  have  a  personal  experience  with  mass,  gravity,  inertia,  and  the  effects  of  a  reaction  force.
From this point of view, modern space propulsion is high technology applied to very old concepts.
Propulsion  by  reaction  is  a  well  established  technology  but  it  is  not  suitable  for  interstellar  space  travel
because  the  total  amount  of  propellant  required  would  become  unacceptable,  moreover  the  related  speed
limitations would require missions lasting many decades if not centuries.
Many interesting techniques have been proposed in the literature, which could improve the various functional
elements  of  a  space  propulsion  system,  but  no  radically  new  approach  appeared  until  1994.  In  that  year
Miguel Alcubierre described a theoretical approach to what appears to be a form of propellantless propulsion
capable of reaching the highest speeds (Alcubierre, 1994).
Alcubierre’s analysis did neither addressed the problem of the energy required for his propulsion system, nor
he explained the precise nature of the propulsor itself.
The  estimations  of  the  energy  required  for  a  warp  drive  have  changed  from  an  amount  comparable  to  ten
times the total energy content of the universe to an amount of few solar masses.
The hardware of the warp drive propulsor is still a mystery. For a warp drive, negative energy densities are
required  and  the  associated  exotic  matter  is  forbidden  classically.  Negative  energy  densities  may  exist  in
quantum  field  theories,  nevertheless  it  is  not  know  if  these  favourable  conditions  can  be  created  in  a  non
transient form and, with more emphasis, it is not known how they could be created in the space surrounding
the vehicle.
Fortunately  a  simpler  approach  to  propellantless  propulsion  exists  and  it  can  be  derived  from  general
relativity like Alcubierre’s warp drive.
This paper describes how spacetime could be manipulated with gravitational radiation and how gravitational
radiation could be generated. The important issues of the amount of energy required and the detailed structure
of  the  propulsion  system  are  still  an  open  question,  nevertheless  these  issues  appear  within  our  research
abilities.

Our  approach  is  based  on  some  aspects  of  general  relativity,  specifically  the  existence  of  gravitational
radiation,  the  properties  of  colliding  beams  of  gravitational  radiation  and  the  possible  mechanisms  for  the
generation of gravitational radiation.

ON THE EXISTENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION

At the beginning of the XX century Albert Einstein developed the concepts of relativity and newtonian gravity
into  a  more  complete  and  credible  theory  of  gravitation,  general  relativity.  In  general  relativity  there  are  10
quantities  that  can  create  gravity:  the  energy  density,  three  components  of  momentum  density,  and  six
components of stress. There are 10 unknowns, represented by the components of the metric tensor.
The field equations can be written in terms of a set of 10 fields that are components of a symmetric 4x4 matrix
hab representing the deviation of the metric tensor from that of special relativity, the Minkowsky metric of flat
spacetime.

The  source  represents  the  set  of  energy  densities  and  stresses  that  can  create  the  field.  This  expression
substantially describes the gravitational field as distortion of the geometry of spacetime as a function of energy,
momentum densities and stresses in a source.  If velocities in the source are much smaller than c, and h is small
compared to 1 (non linear terms in the source negligible) then the Einstein equations reduce to the Newton’s
equation in and near the source.
General relativity admits solutions of the field equations in the form of waves. Einstein himself calculated the
emission of gravitational waves from various sources under a number of restrictive conditions. We have indeed
numerous  exact  solutions  obtained  using  the  linearized  equations.  These  solutions  are  employed  for
gravitational  wave  research  from  astrophysical  sources  in  order  to  study  the  emission,  propagation  and  the
detection of gravitational waves. They have been also employed for the study of the emission of gravitational
radiation from experimental devices.
If the above mentioned linearization is not applicable we are dealing with a problem that could be solved with
an ad hoc approximation or by very complex numerical methods. For instance the full scale highly relativistic
simulation of inspiralling and merging black holes might require 10 years of supercomputer operations.
Usually a problem can be divided into a number of partial problems to which different techniques apply. For
instance the emission of gravitational radiation by an astrophysical source may require ad hoc methods with a
nonlinearity expansion, but wave propagation and detection can be studied with the linearized approximation
(Thorne, 1980).
Gravitational wave are transverse wave like electromagnetic waves, they differ from e-m waves also because of
their  quadrupolar  nature.  With  a  set  of  free  test  particles,  a  passing  gravitational  wave  will  produce  a  small
relative acceleration of the particles and of their local inertial frames. The relative acceleration is described by
quadrupole-shaped lines of force. The two possible polarizations are “+” and “· ” separated by a p /4 angle.
If a set of test particles is distributed along a circle, with the plane containing the particles orthogonal to the
direction of propagation of the wave, the passing wave will change the shape of the circle to that of an ellipse,
then  to  a  circle,  then  to  an  ellipse  rotated  by  p /2  respect  to  the  previous  one,  etc.    The  transverse  plane
gravitational wave are area preserving and the amplitude of the deformation of  the circle of test particles is h.
In 1918 Albert Einstein derived the expression for the gravitational wave field as a function of the second time
derivative of the quadrupole moment of the source.

The dimensionless amplitude  h  of  the  gravitational  waves  of  astrophysical  origin  that  could  be  detected  on
earth and with a frequency of about 1 kHz is between 10-17 and 10-22. Gravitational waves can be detected by
measuring the effects of  spacetime distortion on a beam of laser light (interferometric sensor) or the resulting
stress  on  a  mechanical  resonator  (Weber  bar  detector)  (Thorne,  1980).  The  predicted  amplitude  for
astrophysical sources is so small that researchers are not certain that a direct gravitational wave detection has
ever been made. The detection of artificially generated gravitational waves is an even worse challenge, because
only  ultradense  materials  rotating  at  near  relativistic  regimes  could  efficiently  emit  gravitational  radiation
detectable at great distances. In spite of the difficulties a near field test has been succesfully made (Astone,
1991) using a 8.75 kg rotor with a quadrupole moment of 5.5(cid:215) 10-3 kg m2 rotating at 30000 rpm and located at a
distance of 3.5m from the center of the Weber bar gravitational wave antenna Explorer at CERN.
As gravitational radiation transfers energy and momentum, its existence could be inferred by the back-reaction
on the source. It has been determined that the back-reaction on a possible binary pulsar could change the orbital
period of the system in a detectable and very peculiar way. The study of such a system could also provide a
validity check for general relativity. Fortunately in 1973 Taylor and Hulse discovered the first binary pulsar,
they discovered the signature of the emission of gravitational radiation in the emitted radio pulses, and verified
the  validity  of  general  relativity.  This  work  has  been  recognized  with  the  Nobel  prize  in  Physics  in  1993
(Hulse, 1994),  (Taylor, 1994).

ON THE PROPERTIES OF GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION

Two properties of gravitational radiation are of interest for us. The first property is that gravitational radiation
can be directly employed for propulsion. The second property is a consequence of the non-linearity of Einstein
equations.  If  the  amplitude  of  the  gravitational  wave  is  sufficiently  high,  this  non-linearity  is  the  source  of
harmonics and coulomb-like components. Moreover, for colliding beams, spacetime may act as a mixer, again
with the appearance of coulomb-like components. By comparison, the propagation of an electromagnetic wave
in  a  non  linear  medium,  for  instance  the  ionosphere,  may  cause  charge  separation  which  is  the  origin  of
ionization and electric discharges, but it is not useful for propulsion, this is because electromagnetism admits
positive and negative charges, but macroscopic objects are usually neutral.
We do not discuss the amplitude of the gravitational wave required for the generation of evident non-linearity
effects, we simply observe that these phenomena are compatible with a highly relativistic system, for instance a
binary system of neutron stars.
About the possibility of accelerating an object only by its internal motion a very interesting paper has recently
been  published  (Bonnor,  1997).  Here  the  motion  of  a  rocket  accelerated  by  an  anisotropic  emission  of
gravitational waves has been studied using approximation methods. These methods do not assume conservation
of momentum or ad hoc formulae, the equation of motion are obtained by directly solving the field equations.
The energy loss of the rocket by the emission of gravitational waves has been found to be in agreement with the
quadrupole formula. The power loss is:

where m is the initial mass of the rocket, a some convenient length associated with it and p, q are function of  t,
the  quadrupole  moment  is  here  Q(t)=ma 2h(t),  and  the  octupole  moment  is  O(t)=ma 3k(t),  moreover
p(x)=d2h(x)/dx2 and q(x)=d3k(x)/dx3. Both expressions contain terms indicating that, with today’s knowledge,
only astrophysical objects could emit gravitational radiation capable of producing a detectable effect, but we
must take into account that in general relativity the definition of the energy transported by a plane gravitational
wave is an open question.
About  the  second  property  of  gravitational  radiation  which  could  be  of  interest  for  space  travel,  the  results
obtained after 30 years of research may be briefly described as follows. The interaction of two impulsive plane
waves with infinite wavefronts starts a self focusing process which is believed to end with the creation of a
spacetime  singularity  regardless  of  the  amplitude  of  the  wave  (Szekeres,  1972).  The  time  required  for  the
creation of the singularity is a function of the amplitude of the waves A and the relative polarization a of the
two waves (Ferrari, 1988).

These  results  can  also  be  applied    to  the  more  realistic  case  of  beam-like  gravitational  waves  (Ferrari,
Pendenza, Veneziano, 1988), and are confirmed by a work describing the interaction of two graviton beams
(Veneziano,  1987).  The  collision  of    gravitational  plane  wave  may  produce  a  curvature  singularity  or  a
coordinate singularity, where the radiation is completely converted in a coulomb-like gravitational field. We
may now make the conjecture that a single perfectly focused beam of gravitational radiation might produce a
spacetime singularity at the focus regardless the amplitude of the wave, moreover in the eventuality of optical
imperfections  of  the  focused  beam,  they  could  be  spontaneously  reduced  by  the  behaviour  of  the  collision
process, this property should improve with the amplitude and the high frequency content of the wave.
The  solutions  of  the  collision  problem  correspond  to  a  class  of  black  hole  solutions,  the  similarity  of  the
solutions  does  not  imply  that  the  two  physical  system  are  identical  or  identically  stable  when  the  external
conditions are changed, but we might expect similar effects. Although the similarity could be simply due the
precise mathematical description of the collision problem, the possibility of  creating a mini black hole cannot
be excluded with today knowledge, and this is the main safety concern if attempts are made for creating these
conditions in a laboratory.
Again,  theories  give  curious  results,  in  general  relativity  non-linearity  is  associated  to  highly  relativistic
systems like extreme astrophysical objects, but the interaction of gravitational waves seems capable of reaching
these extreme conditions regardless the amplitude of the wave.
We  have  seen  that  the  mutual  interaction  of  gravitational  waves  would  cause  the  appearance  of  a  rectified
wave,  accompanied  by  a  coulomb-like  gravitational  field.  If  this  field  is  created  outside  a  spacecraft,  the
spacecraft would free-fall towards the distorsion. Using the classical picture for the spacetime distortion created
by a mass, our spacecraft would follow a depression in spacetime. The moving depression would in turn emit
energy as gravitational waves like a moving mass.
Using the famous Einstein equation we observe that energy density (matter) is not an efficient source of gravity
because of m=E/c2, and for two equal massive particles the internal rest energy is much higher than the integral
gravitational energy, moreover moving this source of gravity to a different location requires the transportation
of  this  energy  density.  Instead,  gravitational  waves  can  be  directly  and  completely  converted  into  a
gravitational field which should follow the focus point of the beam(s).  The source(s) of the beam(s) could be
onboard the spacecraft.

LABORATORY GENERATION OF GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION

Historically, the emission of gravitational radiation has been studied in astrophysical systems, as reported in the
second section of this paper, and a quite large literature exists on the subject. Instead, the laboratory generation
of gravitational radiation is still in its theoretical stage of development except, perhaps, the rotor employed for
the  calibration  of  a  GW  antenna  (Astone,  1991),  which  has  indeed  produced  experimental  results  for  a  near
field detection.
Because we expect that gravitational radiation should be generated starting from a known energy source, we
observe that an important parameter certainly is conversion efficiency i.e. the ratio between the output power in
gravitational  radiation  and  the  input  power.  The  difference  between  the  input  and  output  power  has  to  be
dissipated and this could be a serious collateral problem.
Moreover, from eq. 4 we observe that among the many parameters, the amplitude is influenced by w 6,  leading
to the idea that a higher frequency could improve the output of the generator.
Combining  the  request  of  higher  frequencies  and  low  losses  leads  to  the  idea  that  a  microscopic  source  of
gravitational radiation could be the preferred source for our application.
The possible structure, the computed output power and conversion efficiency of classical and quantum sources
of gravitational radiation are shortly described in the following sub-sections.

Gravitational Radiation from Classical Systems

Three  non-quantum  mechanism  can  be  identified  for  the  possible  laboratory  generation  of  high  frequency
gravitational  radiation  (Pinto,  1988):  the  coherent  EM-GW  converter,  the  EM-pulsed  source  and  the
photon/phonon pumped generator. The possibility of arranging several elementary generators in an array will
give a beamed emission.
In EM-GW converter the stress-energy tensor of the EM field is the source of the gravitational radiation.
The  EM-GW  converter  has  been  studied  on  the  basis  of  a  cylindrical  EM  resonator  with  a  static  axial  bias
magnetic field H0.
Using the TE111 resonant mode the power dissipated by the walls and the power emitted by gravitational waves
has been computed (Pinto,1988).

Using H0=H111=105 Gauss, l=1m, d/R=10, we obtain Pgw»10-17 W, with Pinput»Pwalls»109 W.
The EM-pulsed source consists in a short solenoid or permanent magnet and a TEM transmission line which
traverse the magnetic field generated by the solenoid. Pulses of EM energy are then sent along the transmission
line. The amplitude h» 10-34 is expected from this generator if employing ring transmission lines with a radius
of 10 km and EM pulse generators with power of several MW.
The photon/phonon pumped GW generator consists of an array of piezoelectric plates excited by a UHF-SHF
modulated laser beam.
An expression of the GW output power of this generator has been obtained (Pinto, 1988):

plates, vs and c the speed of sound and the speed of light respectively.
The computed conversion efficiency for typical vs/c ratio is about four order of magnitude lower than that of a
pure EM converter. If vs»c than the efficiency of this converter could become about 13 orders of magnitude
higher than the pure EM converter.

Gravitational Radiation from Quantum Systems

Like electromagnetic radiation, gravitational radiation could be emitted by quantum transitions. We introduce
this  concept  with  the  simple  analogy  to  the  well  known  binary  pulsar  GW  source.  By  this  analogy  the  ideal
laboratory source of gravitational radiation could be a couple of almost identical orbiting objects with nuclear
matter  density  and  with  electric  charge,  which  will  give  us  the  ability  of  controlling  them  with  an
electromagnetic  field.  Being  the  scale  factor  in  principle  not  relevant  for  the  efficiency  of  the  EM-GW
converter, and looking for a high frequency array of such objects, we could reduce the scale factor reaching, for
instance, the size of  Cooper’s pairs, which certainly satisfy our initial requirements.
At atomic scale the emission of a quantum of gravitational radiation, the graviton, is accompanied by a  L=2
transition in the quantized angular momentum of the emitting system.
In (Halpern, 1964) the investigation of the interaction of the gravitational fields with microscopic systems has
been  extended  to  the  nuclear  and  molecular  phenomena,  with  the  interesting  result  that  the  gravitational
interactions  have  here  a  greater  significance  than  at  a  macroscopic  level,  where  gravitational  radiation  is
extremely difficult to generate and detect. The multipole expansion of the gravitational radiation field resulting
from  periodically  oscillating  sources  has  been  performed  in  full  analogy  with  the  method  used  for  the
electromagnetic  fields,  thus  formally  reproducing  a  successful  and  experimentally  tested  methodology.
According to (Halpern, 1964) and (Halpern, 1968) atomic transitions for which the orbital quantum number L
changes  by  +  or  –  2,  and  for  which  the  total  quantum  number  J  changes  by  0  or  +  or  –  2  are  gravitational
quadrupolar  transitions  and  are  permitted  for  the  emission  of  gravitons,  while  the  emission  of  photons  is
forbidden. It has been found that atomic transitions from orbitals 3d to 1s, 3d to 2s and 3d to 3s are possible
candidates for transitions, which may be applicable for the generation of gravitational radiation by atoms of a
suitable  material.  The  material  could  be  pumped  by  photons  and  let  decay  gravitationally.  Unfortunately  the
gravitational  transition  probability  is  much  lower  than  in  the  electromagnetic  case;  this  ratio  for  matrix
elements of equal structures is of the order of:

    R= c

 2(mc)2/e2

(11)

 where c
 2 is defined in (Halpern, 1964), e is the charge and m the mass of the emitting particle. For a proton
this ratio is 1.6(cid:215) 10-36, but it could be about 104 times larger for molecular transitions. Halpern and Laurent first
looked  for  a  natural  source  of  high  frequency  gravitational  radiation,  they  computed  that  the  energy  of
gravitons involved in some possible stellar processes was very high, 14.4 keV for 57Fe in the sun and 16.1 MeV
from supernovae (Halpern, 1964). Discussing the possibility of a stimulated emission, they also suggested the
physical  structure  of  the  gravitational  counterpart  of  the  laser,  called  a  "gaser".  The  device  structure  was  a

œ
ß
ø
Œ
º
Ø
cavity-less single pass device similar to X-ray lasers of today. Again, the extremely low probability of graviton
absorption and emission indicates that gasers might not be possible within simple atomic systems.
We have seen that if we pump a given quantum system to a gravitationally excited state with electromagnetic
radiation, the resulting state is also an electromagnetically excited state and the probability of electromagnetic
emission is higher than the gravitational one by a factor of about 1036, leading to the conclusion that a different
approach is required.
We now imagine a binary quantum system in which we abruptly change the attraction force between the two
equal  particles  composing  the  system,  the  resulting  probability  of  states  changes  accordingly,  and  if  the
appropriate  change  has  taken  place,  an  induced  emission  of  a  graviton  could  result.  Measurements  of  the
quantized  angular  momentum  of  Cooper’s  pairs  in  different  superconducting  materials  have  been  made,  and
they are compatible with above mentioned possibility. In fact, recently (Harlingen, 1995), (Kouznetsov, 1997),
(Sigrist,  1995),  (Ding,  1996),  (Barret,  1991)  it  has  been  experimentally  observed  the  existence  of  only  two
different symmetries of the order parameter in low Tc and high Tc superconductors, a symmetry with a  s-wave
component (LTSC and YBCO HTSC) and a symmetry with a d-wave component (HTSC) (Kouznetsov, 1997),
therefore we know that Cooper-pairs are in s-orbitals and d-orbitals respectively. We can also predict that when
Cooper-pairs  move  under  non  equilibrium  conditions,  i.e.  under  the  effect  of  magnetic  fields,  from  a
superconductor  where  the  symmetry  of  the  order  parameter  is  of  type  d  to  a  superconductor  where  this
symmetry is of type s, they are subject to transition and loose energy by the emission of a particle with a spin of
2. A related phenomenon, which is important for the estimation of the binding energy, is the observed emission
of wide band THz electromagnetic radiation in a YBCO/insulator/normal-metal junction. This emission is not
related to the Josephson effect, and it has been found to be originated by the recombination of Cooper-pairs and
quasiparticles at the interface with the non-superconducting material that gives a channel to photon and phonon
recombination (Lee, 1998); although the power of the emission was very small, the experiment shows that the
electron  binding  energy  is  actually  released  at  the  interface  and  a  measure  of  this  energy  is  given.  A
comprehensive discussion on the symmetry of pairing states in both conventional and high Tc superconductors
can be found in (Harlingen, 1995) and therein references.
A junction between a  s-wave  and  a  d-wave  superconductor  (SDS  junction)  can  be  here  defined  with  the
purpose  of  inserting  the  junction  in  an  electrical  circuit  and  studying  the  maximum  possible  emission  of
radiation. We could estimate the maximum amplitude of the radiation emitted by a SDS junction employing an
energy balance equation.  Keeping the SDS junction at a temperature much below Tcs and Tcd, the binding

energy that is released by a single transition could be a fraction of: 

, where  Tcd  is  the  critical
temperature of the d-wave superconductor, Tcs is the critical temperature of the  s-wave superconductor and kB
the Boltzmann constant, considering that the electron binding energy is proportional to the critical temperature.
If we make the hypothesis that this fraction is a factor of one, we may write the usual energy balance equation:
T
observed in (Lee, 1998). The maximum power emitted by the process could be found with the hypothesis of
currents about the critical currents of most supercondutors, and of about 10 kA/cm2, this current density may
also suppress the Josephson effect on the Bose condensate. Introducing the charge of the electron we obtain a
power density of:

which is of the order of ten W/cm2.
Coherent and collimated emission orthogonal to the plane of the junction is expected because transitions are
between two Cooper pairs reservoir where pairs are all condensed in two quantum states so that the frequency
and phase of the radiation emitted by each transition is rigorously the same for each event.
A  detailed  analysis  of  SDS  junctions  including  possible  gravitational  effects  has  been  not  yet  performed,
mainly because no satisfactory theory exists to explain electron pairing in high Tc superconductors. Therefore
whether these induced L=2 transitions are associated to gravitons remains to be investigated both theoretically
and experimentally.

Despite the lack of strong research efforts towards the here presented possibility, some kind of SDS junction
have  been  recently  studied  in  order  to  gain  some  further  knowledge  in  high  temperature  superconductivity
(Moessle).
M.Moessle  and  R.  Kleiner  have  experimentally  found  that  a  nonzero  supercurrent  in  a  c-axis  Pb/BSCCO
Josephson tunnel junction can be observed and cannot be explained by trivial reasons. It appeared that, an s-
wave component of the superconducting order parameter has to be present also in BSCCO, which is a pure
d-wave superconductor.  Moessle and  Kleiner reported that in a strict sense, the data show the existence of the
s component only in the vicinity of the interface and at temperatures below the Tc of Pb.
A theory on SDS junction, which does not include gravitational effects has been developed by Yukio Tanaka
His  paper  presents  a  theory  which  predicts  a  supercurrent  in  s/i/d  junctions,  using    the  previous  theories  by
Arnold,  Furusaki  and  Tsukada  which  include  infinite  orders  of  the  tunneling  process.  Josephson  current
between  d  wave/insulator/s  wave  planar-contact  junction  (d/s  junction)  is  calculated.  In  such  cases,  critical
current Ic is proportional to Tc-T near the transition temperature Tc. The basic argument is that s wavefunction
and d wavefunction are orthogonal and no supercurrent can be predicted for a SDS junction unless a particle
associated to a kind of radiation is emitted or absorbed. We identify this possible particle with the graviton,
which has the appropriate spin.
Halpern and Laurent’s theory predicts an extremely low probability of emission of gravitons on a general basis,
nevertheless this is a linearized theory,  we can try to be more realistic by considering the relativistic mass of
the electron in the tunneling process: m=mo/(cid:214) (1-v2/c2).  Here  an  additional  difficulty  arises  because  electrons
apparently might traverse tunnel junctions at the speed of light making its mass infinite for and infinitesimal
time.  The  ratio  in  eq.  11  could  become  infinite  for  an  infinitesimal  time  and  much  higher  than  one  for  an
interval of time sufficient for the emission of a graviton.

CONCLUSION

This paper has shortly described the most relevant elements of  what the author believes could become a new
propulsion technique. The theoretical background is that of general relativity and the main subject of the paper
is gravitational radiation from man made sources. With reference to a wide collection of theoretical papers and
few  experimental  one,  it  has  been  shown  that  gravitational  radiation  can  be  employed  for  space  propulsion.
Moreover  it  has  been  shown  that  gravitational  radiation  can  be  generated  by  artificial  means  and  a  new
hypothesis  on  its  possible  emission  from  a  quantum  system  has  been  proposed.  Further  developments  are
expected  by  a  deeper  analysis  of  the  collision  problem  and  the  study  of  gravitational  transitions  in  some
promising materials.

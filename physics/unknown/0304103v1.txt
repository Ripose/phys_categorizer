The alpha-radiometric determination of uranium after its pre-concentration from natural

water samples using the cation-exchange resin Chelex-100, its selective extraction by

tributylphosphate and electrodeposition on stainless steel discs is reported. The validity

of the separation procedure and the chemical recoveries were checked by addition of

uranium standard solution as well as by tracing with U232. The average uranium yield

was determined to be (97 ± 2) % for the cation-exchange, (95 ± 2) % for the liquid-

liquid extraction, and more than 99% for the electrodeposition. Employing high-

resolution α-spectroscopy, the measured activity of the U238 and U234 radioisotopes was

found to be of similar magnitude; i.e. ∼7 mBq L−1 and ∼35 mBq L−1 for ground- and

seawater samples, respectively. The energy resolution (FWHM) of the α−peaks was 22

keV, while the Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) was estimated to be 1 mBq L−1 (at

the 95% confidence limit).

Introduction

The determination of background concentrations and levels of environmental

contamination from facilities handling enriched uranium or due to the military use of

depleted uranium can be made more accurately if the isotopic ratio is measured in

addition to the total uranium concentration. Furthermore, accurate knowledge of

uranium isotopic ratios in natural systems (e.g. seawater) is of particular interest

regarding geochronology, paleothermometry and pollution budgets. 1,2

Several methods, such as spectrophotometry,3 Χ−ray fluorescence spectroscopy,4

inductive

coupled plasma mass

spectrometry,2,5 neutron activation analysis,6

voltametry,7 alpha spectroscopy,8 alpha liquid scintilation9 etc., have been used to

measure uranium concentration in natural waters. However, only mass spectrometry,

neutron activation analysis and alpha spectroscopy are useful for determining isotopic

ratios. Regarding alpha spectroscopy, it has the advantage of low cost and robust

radioanalytical method, which can widely be used in routine analysis for

the

determination of U234/U238 and U235/U238 isotopic ratios in greatly enriched samples.

Pre-concentration and isolation of uranium from large amounts of the aquatic matrix is

necessary because of the low uranium concentrations in natural waters and the

interference of inactive substances with the alpha particles emitted, which eventually

leads to lower spectral resolution and higher detection limits. Pre-concentration and

isolation procedures include various pre-analytical techniques such as co-precipitation,

extraction and ion-exchange.8

2

In this paper a relatively simple and effective method for the pre-concentration and

separation of uranium from natural waters (e.g. seawater and groundwater) and its alpha

radiometric determination after electrodeposition on stainless steel discs is presented.

This method combines cation-exchange and liquid-liquid extraction techniques and is

applicable to various aquatic solutions. In addition, the employment of high-resolution

α−spectroscopy allows an accurate determination of the activity of the U238 and U234

radioisotopes, even though they appear at very low concentrations. The measurements

have been carried out in the Laboratories of Radioanalytical Chemistry and Nuclear

Physics of the University of Cyprus.

Experimental

Reagents and instruments

In all experiments analytical grade reagents and deionized water was used. The Pu236-

Tracer solution was obtained from AEA Technology, Nuclear Science. The Chelex-100

resin (100-200 mesh, Bio-Rad Labs) was used as received. Arsenazo(III) solutions were

prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of arsenazo(III) salt (obtained from Aldrich

Co) in aquatic 0.01 M HClO4. HNO3 solutions of various concentrations (e.g. 2 and 8 M

HNO3) were prepared by diluting a concentrated solution (68% HNO3). 30% v/v TBP

solution was freshly prepared by mixing the appropriate volumes of tributyl phosphate

(TBP) and dodecan, both obtained from Aldrich Co. (NH4)2SO4 solutions were prepared

by dissolving ammonium sulfate (99.999%, Aldrich Co) in deionized water.

Photometric and radiometric analysis of uranium was performed using a Shimadzu UV-

2401 spectrophotometer and a high-resolution α-spectroscopic system equipped with

ULTRA ion-implanted silicon detectors, described below.

Sample preparation

Sample collection included surface seawater and groundwater from three different

coastal and one inland area of the island, respectively. 5-L water samples were spiked

with 1.53 Bq of Pu236 and 5 mBq of U232 using 200 µL of a tracer solution in 2 M

HNO3. Isotopic Standard Reference Tracer Solution was dissolved in 2 M HNO3 to

prepare the spikes.

Uranium separation by cation exchange resin

The separation of uranium from the aqueous matrix was performed by cation exchange

using the Chelex-100 resin.10,11 10 g of Chelex-100 resin and 20 g of ammonium acetate

were added to 5-L samples contained in 5-L polypropylene beaker and stirred on a

magnetic stirring table. The pH of the solutions was then adjusted to the desired value

(pH = 5.3), with the aid of a pH meter, using 2 M HNO3 solution. After pH adjustment

the beakers were sealed and stirred for at least an hour. The resin was separated from

the solution by filtration, with the aid of a Buchner funnel (with sintered glass disc) and

washed with 20 mL of distilled water.

Uranium extraction and electrodeposition

Following this initial separation, the uranium was eluted from the Chelex-100 resin with

30 mL of 2 M HNO3 solution. The acidic solutions were evaporated to incipient dryness

and the residual was dissolved in 15 mL of 8 M HNO3 solution. The latter and 15 mL of

the 30% TBP solution were added in a 100 mL, short stemmed, separatory funnel, and

the content was shaken vigorously for about 30 seconds. This extraction procedure was

repeated once more and the aqueous phase was discarded. The uranium was removed

4

from the organic phase by extracting successively two times with 30 mL of distilled

water and collecting the aqueous phase in a 150 mL beaker.

The aqueous solutions were evaporated to incipient dryness and the residual was

dissolved in 10 mL of 0.15 M (NH4)2SO4 solution. From this solution uranium was

directly electrodeposited on a stainless steel disc (diameter of the active area 10 mm) at

a voltage of 15 V and a current of 0.4 A for 2 hours.12

High-resolution α−spectroscopy

A stand-alone high-resolution spectroscopic system is used for the measurement of the

energy spectrum of the emitted α−particles in the energy range between 3000 keV and

8000 keV. The system consists of cylindrical ULTRA ion-implanted silicon detectors

(EG&G ORTEC BU-020-450-300) that are characterized by an active area of 450 mm2

and by a depletion depth of 300 µm. The detectors are mounted on the inside of a low-

background vacuum chamber with low-background sample holders (EG&G ORTEC

808). The spectroscopic system is linked with a Multi-Channel Buffer (MCB) which is

a PC-based plug-in PCI card consisting of an 2k Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

An advanced Multi-Channel Analyser (MCA) emulation software (MAESTRO-32)

enables data acquisition, storage, display and online analysis of the acquired α-spectra.

The energy resolution and detection efficiency were determined using a calibrated

mixed open source†, consisting of Np237, Am241, and Cm244 at nominal activities of 150

Bq, 100 Bq, and 100 Bq, respectively. The source material has been uniformly

electrodeposited on a stainless steel disc to an effective diameter of 10 mm. The source

laboratory for measurements of radioactivity (DKD).

disc was mounted on a sample holder at a distance of about 10 cm from the detector. A

measured α−spectrum from this source is shown in Fig. 1.

The energy resolution (FWHM) achieved in the measurements was 22 keV, whereas the

detection efficiency for each detector was calculated to be 0.35% of 4π. Considering an

uncertainty of 3% in the source activity,

the mean uncertainty in the calculated

efficiency was estimated to be about 5%. Finally, the Minimum Detectable Activity

(MDA) reached in the measurements was estimated to be about 1 mBq per liter

(mBq L−1) at the 95% confidence limit.

The offline analysis of each measured α−ray spectrum has been carried out by a

dedicated software programme (AlphaVision-32)13, which performs a simultaneous fit

to all

the statistically significant peaks appearing in the spectrum. Reports were

generated which included the centroid channel, energy, net area counts, background

counts, intensity and width of identified and unidentified peaks in the spectrum, as well

as the calculated activity in Bq L−1 for each detected radionuclide. It is noted here that

prior to the samples measurement,

the background was carefully measured under

identical measurement conditions and was found to be about 24 counts per day within

the energy range of 3−8 MeV. It has been subtracted from the measured α−ray spectra

of each sample.

Results and Discussion

Uranium in surface seawater exists quantitatively in the hexavalent oxidation state and

the anionic uranium-carbonato complexes, UO2(CO3)2

2- and UO2(CO3)3

4-, govern the

chemical behaviour of uranium in solution under seawater conditions.1,2 Acidification

(pH < 7) of seawater samples results in the destabilisation of the carbonato species and

6

the formation of uranium(VI)-hydroxo- or uranium(VI)-aquo- complexes.14 The

separation and pre-concentration of uranium by the cation exchange resin Chelex-100

was performed at pH = 5.3, because at this pH value the cationic uranium(VI) species,

2+

UO2

and UO2OH+, are predominant in solution and the competition of protons,

regarding cation-exchange, relatively low. The uranium recovery during the cation

exchange procedure was followed by spectrophotometry using arsenazo(III)3 and was

calculated to be (97 ± 2) %. Determination of the uranium yield after the various pre-

analytical steps (e.g. cation-exchange and liquid-liquid extraction) was performed by

photometry using arsenazo III, because the alpha radiometric determination by means of

surface barrier detectors was not possible or resulted in very bad quality of spectra.

Only the total uranium yield could be determined alpha-radiometrically by tracing the

samples with a Pu236/U232 standard tracer solution.

After cation-exchange, the samples were largely free of extraneous ions, but contained

still too much heavy metal ions, which disturbed the homogeneous electrodeposition of

uranium on the stainless steel discs. Therefore, the samples were purified further by a

standard tributyl-phosphate extraction procedure,15 which removes almost all remaining

interferences. The uranium yield after the extraction procedures was determined by

photometry and was calculated to be (93 ± 2) %. Hence, the overall chemical recovery

of uranium was determined to be (90 ± 3) %.

The electrodeposition of uranium on stainless steel discs was optimised and resulted in

excellent yields, generally over 99%.

In order to check the reproducibility of the

electrodeposition procedure and also the detection efficiency and performance of the

α−spectroscopic system, six identical samples were prepared from the Pu236 tracer

solution with an initial activity of 1 Bq each. After electrodeposition to stainless steel

discs (10 mm in diameter) and measuring the corresponding α−spectra (the Pu236 main

7

α−peak appears at an energy of ∼5770 keV), the initial activity of 1 Bq could be

reproduced within 5% by all six samples.

The measured α−ray spectra from Cyprus natural water samples have revealed rather

low activity concentration of U238 and U234 radioisotopes. Therefore, in order to obtain

the α−peaks with sufficient statistics (5-10% statistical error), the accumulation time

had to be rather long (about 7−10 days for each sample). Nevertheless, the α−spectra

were obtained at high-energy resolution (FWHM ∼22 keV) and nearly background-free,

demonstrating the effectiveness and specificity of the procedure as well as the excellent

long-term stability of the α−spectroscopic system. A typical example of the quality of

the measured α−spectra is presented in Fig. 2 for a seawater sample. As can be seen,

the two main α−peaks due to the U238 and U234 radioisotopes (with energies of ∼4198

keV and of ∼4776 keV, respectively) revealed almost comparable intensities. No other

statistically significant α−peaks than those of the U238 and U234 radioisotopes were

detected in the measured samples. The small contribution (∼2%) due to the U235

radioisotope was below the experimental detection limit.

The activity concentration, calculated from the spectrum shown in Fig. 2, was (35.0 ±

1.9) mBq L−1 and

(37.5 ± 2.0) mBq L−1 for the U238 and U234 radioisotopes,

respectively. The activity ratio (U234/U238) was then estimated to be 1.07 ± 0.08. The

other

seawater

samples

that were investigated exhibited very similar activity

concentrations. Uranium concentration in groundwater revealed even lower values,

which amounted to (6.6 ± 0.8) mBq L−1 and (6.7 ± 0.8) mBq L−1 for the U238 and U234

radioisotopes, respectively. The corresponding activity ratio (U234/U238) was calculated

to be 1.01 ± 0.15.

8

In naturally occurring uranium radioisotopes, the activity ratio A(U234/U238) can be

calculated according to the following expression:

where T is the half-life, f is the fractional atomic abundance, and Μ is the atomic mass

of the corresponding radioisotope indicated. Taking current values from the literature,16

the above formula yields A(U234/U238) ≅ 1.05.

Within the experimental uncertainties quoted, the measured activity ratios (U234/U238) fit

very well to the expected value of ∼1.05 (Eq. (1)), revealing the natural origin of the

measured uranium radioisotopes.

Conclusions

Exploitation of a rather robust and effective radioanalytical method for the pre-

concentration and separation of uranium from natural waters (e.g. seawater and

groundwater samples) as well as of high-resolution α−spectroscopy provide a sensitive

experimental tool in measuring activity concentration of the U238 and U234 radioisotopes

and determining their activity ratio after electrodeposition on stainless steel discs. In

general, the measured α−spectra from ground- and seawater samples studied were

obtained almost background-free and revealed rather low activity concentration of the

U238 and U234 radioisotopes, exhibiting values of ∼7 mBq L−1 and ∼35 mBq L−1 for

ground- and seawater samples, respectively.

In all samples studied,

the activity

(U234/U238) ratio was found to be consistent with the value of ∼1.05, which is expected

from naturally occurring uranium.

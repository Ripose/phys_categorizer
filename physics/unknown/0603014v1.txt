Abstract:  The  string,  MSSM  GUT,  weak  and  QCD  scales,  and  the  Rydberg  constant,

correspond  to  the  positions  of  AdS  domain  wall  intersections  in  a  two-dimensional  extra

space of infinite extent. The domain walls lie along and parallel to the sides of cells which tile

the extra space. The cells are four-sided with parallel opposite sides of lengths Rln(π/2) and

Rlnπ, where R is the AdS radius of curvature. Particle masses correspond to the positions of

domain walls. We represent the extra space graphically.

1 Introduction

In the Randall and Sundrum RS I model [1], an extra spatial dimension is compactified on an
S1/Z2 orbifold and the Standard Model particles and forces are confined to a negative-tension

3-brane, the ‘visible’ brane, separated from a positive-tension 3-brane, the Planck or ‘hidden’

brane, by a slice of five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS5) of geometry

where ηµν is the Minkowski metric of four-dimensional spacetime, k is the AdS curvature and

y  is  the  coordinate  of  the  extra  dimension.  The  exponential  factor  is  the  source  of  the

hierarchy between the Planck and weak scales; it  results  from  the  small  overlap  in  the  fifth

dimension of the graviton wave function with our ‘visible’ 3-brane. In the RS II model [2],

the negative tension brane is moved off to infinity; the visible brane is at y = 0. Lykken and

Randall  have  combined  the  results  of  RS  I  and  II  to  address  the  hierarchy  problem  in  an

infinite  extra  dimension  with  positive  tension  branes  only  [3].  Gravity  is  localized  on  the

Planck brane and we live on a separate brane in the fifth dimension, upon which mass scales

are  exponentially  suppressed.  Oda  has  shown  that  gravity  can  be  trapped  on  multiple  D3-

branes, with positive tension, situated at intervals along the extra dimension [4, 5].

2

On the basis of the AdS/CFT correspondence [6, 7], Verlinde has observed that the coordinate

y  in  (1)  can  be  thought  of  as  parametrizing  the  four-dimensional  scale  [8]:  two  field

excitations  at  energy  scales  related  by  a  transformation  factor  exp(-λ)  correspond  to  two

excitations centred on positions related by a translation y → y + λ/k in the fifth dimension. In

Section  2,  we  will  make  use  of  this  correspondence  between  four-dimensional  scale  and

position  in  an  extra  dimension  to  relate  particle  masses  to  positions  within  two  extra-

dimensional  lattices.  We  will  restrict  the  analysis  to  quarks,  charged  leptons,  weak  gauge

bosons, the lightest flavoured mesons and baryons, and the lightest vector quarkonia states. In

Section  3,  we  will  relate  the  scales  of  physics  to  domain  wall  intersections  in  a  two-

dimensional  extra  space.  In  Section  4,  we  will  show  that  a  ‘weak’  sequence  of  mass  scales

corresponds  to  a  lattice  that  is  incorporated  within  one  of  the  two  fundamental  lattices.  In

Section 5, we will summarize our findings. Values of particle mass have been taken from the

listings of the Particle Data Group [9].

2 Particle mass scales

We  will  assume  that  the  higher-dimensional  spacetime  is  AdS,  that  the  Planck  scale  of  the

spacetime  is  equal  in  size  to  that  of  the  four-dimensional  Planck  scale,  and  that  particles

occupy  lattice  points  in  an  extra  dimension.  A  lattice  of  points  extending  from  the  Planck

brane  with  spacing  d/k  in  an  extra  dimension  will  correspond  to  a  geometric  sequence  of
mass-energy scales that descends from the Planck Mass MP (1.221 x 1019 GeV) with common

ratio  exp(-d).  By  computation,  we  have  found  a  geometric  sequence  of  scales,  Sequence  1,

within which the masses of quarks and baryons are found. The sequence is of common ratio

2/π, to within 1 in 105, corresponding to a lattice spacing of (1/k)ln(π/2). The mass mi of the
ith level of the sequence is given by

m

i

π=
(

)2/

PM

,

−

i

(2)

where i ≥ 0. Baryons occupy the levels and sub-levels of the mass-energy sequence. Levels

are  characterized  by  integer  i;  sub-levels  are  characterized  by  half-integer,  quarter-integer,
eighth-integer,  etc,  i.  The  lightest  strange,  charmed  and  bottom  baryons,  for  which  I(JP)  =
0(½+),  occupy  0th  order  (integer  i)  and  1st  order  sub-levels  (of  half-integer  i),  as  shown  in

Figure 1. Horizontal lines in this graph represent both mass-energy levels and domain walls

that  extend  through  the  lattice  points  and  separate  slices  of  AdS  spacetime.  Mass-energy
levels  of  nth  order  correspond  to  the  positions  in  an  extra  dimension  of  domain  walls  of  nth

order. Λ (uds, I = 0) shares Level 97 with Σ0 (uds, I = 1). Λc

+ (udc) and Λb

0 (udb) occupy 1st

3

order levels. The I(JP) = 0(½+) baryon Ωc
order level, for which i = 95.125, of mass 2697 MeV. The exotic baryon θ+, of mass 1534.3 ±

0 (ssc), of mass 2697.5 ± 2.6 MeV [9], occupies a 3rd

2.5  MeV  [9],  occupies  a  3rd  order  level,  for  which  i  =  96.375,  of  mass  1533  MeV.

Interestingly, the mass difference of Λ and Σ0, 76.959 ± 0.023 MeV [9], closely matches the

mass, 76.98 MeV, of a 0th order level (Level 103). Quarks apparently occupy 0th order levels

in Sequence 1. The mass of Level 102 is 121 MeV, which is consistent with the strange quark

current mass in the  MS  scheme at a scale µ ≈ 2 GeV [9]. The masses of Levels 97, 94 and 86

are  1.16  GeV,  4.48  GeV  and  166  GeV,  respectively,  which  are  consistent  with  the  heavy

quark running masses in the  MS  scheme [9, 10].

The lightest charged lepton (electron) and the lightest flavoured mesons (K± and K0) occupy

the levels of a second geometric sequence of scales, Sequence 2. The sequence is of common

ratio  1/π,  corresponding  to  a  lattice  spacing  of  (1/k)lnπ.  The  mass  mj  of  the  jth  level  of  the

sequence is given by

m

j

−π=

where  j  ≥  0.  The  electron  occupies  Level  45  and  the  K-mesons  occupy  Level  39  in  the

sequence, as shown in Figure 2. The weak gauge bosons W± and Z0 share a 1st order level in

Sequence 2, as shown in Figure 2.

Particles  apparently  occupy  levels  within  both  sequences  but  are  usually  most  closely

associated with (occupy the lowest levels of) one or other sequence. The K-mesons occupy a

0th order level in Sequence 2 and a 3rd order level in Sequence 1, while Λ and Σ0 share a 0th

order level in Sequence 1 and a 3rd order level in Sequence 2. W± and Z0 share a 1st order level

in  both  sequences.  From  these  observations,  it  appears  that  particle  masses  correspond  to

positions within a two-dimensional extra space.

3 The scales of physics

We will conjecture that the two lattices we have identified lie in two different directions in a

two-dimensional  extra  space  and  that  domain  walls  extending  through  the  lattice  points

partition  the  AdS  spacetime.  The  domain  walls  lie  along  and  parallel  to  the  sides  of  cells

which  tile  the  extra  space.  The  cells  are  four-sided  with  parallel  opposite  sides  of  lengths

(1/k)ln(π/2)  and  (1/k)lnπ.  Four-dimensional  scales  will  correspond  to  positions  in  the  extra

4

space  at  equal  distances  from  the  Planck  brane  in  the  two  extra  dimensions;  that  is,  with

positions on a line equidistant from the two sides of the sector in which i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 0. The

line is punctuated by domain wall intersections, usually of different  order.  0th  order  domain

walls intersect on the line at points where (i/k)ln(π/2) = (j/k)lnπ; that is, where i/j = lnπ/ln(π/2)

= 2.535. This condition is met closely at the points where i = 33 and j = 13 (i/j = 2.538), i = 71

and j = 28 (i/j = 2.536), i = 109 and j = 43 (i/j = 2.535), and i = 147 and j = 58 (i/j = 2.534).

The  positions  of  these  domain  wall  intersections  correspond  to  mass-energy  scales  in  a

geometric sequence of common ratio (π/2)38 ≈ π15.

The  GUT  scale  of  the  MSSM  (2  x  1016  GeV)  is  shown  at  the  1st  order  domain  wall

intersection  (i,  ,j)  =  (14,  5.5)  in  Figure  5,  where  one  fundamental  lattice  has  been  drawn

perpendicular to the other. Also included in Figure 5 are the Rydberg constant R∞ (13.6 eV),
the characteristic scale of atomic and molecular physics, at the 2nd order intersection (137.5,

54.25), and scales associated with the quarks of each Standard Model family. The bottom and

top quarks of Sequence 1 lie at equal distances from the intersection  (90,  35.5)  in  the  extra

space.  The  strange  and  charm  quarks  of  Sequence  1  lie  at  equal  distances  from  the

intersection (99.5, 39.25). The up and down quarks, of mass ∼5 MeV [9], lie adjacent to the

0th order domain wall intersection (109, 43), of four-dimensional scale 5.12 MeV. In the extra

space,  the  three  quark  intersections  are  centred  on  intersection  (99.5,  39.25),  which

corresponds to a mass-energy of 375 MeV, ≈ QCD scale  Λ  [11]. The Higgs field VEV (246

GeV) and the masses of the vector boson W± and the vector quarkonia states φ ( ss ), J/ψ ( cc )

and Υ ( bb ) also correspond closely to the positions of low order domain wall intersections,

as shown in Figure 4. We also note that the sizes of the Planck scale, string scale (5 x 1017

GeV)  and  the  GUT  scale  of  the  MSSM  are  related:  Planck  scale/string  scale  ≈  string

scale/GUT  scale  ≈  25  ≈  (π15)3/16,  indicating  that  the  string  scale  also  corresponds  to  the

position  of  a  low  order  domain  wall  intersection.  Finally,  we  must  mention  the  0th  order

domain wall intersection (147, 58), which corresponds to a mass-energy of 0.18 eV and the

quasi-degenerate neutrino mass scale [12].

4 A ‘weak’ sequence of scales

Particles  of  all  types  considered  here  occupy  the  levels  and  sub-levels  of  a  geometric

sequence of scales, of common ratio (2/π)5, which descends from the Higgs field VEV and is

incorporated  within  the  levels  and  sub-levels  of  Sequence  1.  The  ‘weak’  sequence

corresponds  to  a  lattice  of  spacing  (5/k)ln(π/2)  extending  from  a  ‘weak’  domain  wall.  The
mass mw of the wth level of the weak sequence is given by

m

(4)

where v is the Higgs field VEV and w ≥ 0. W±, hadrons containing strange quarks, and the

strange quark of Sequence 1 occupy the lowest order levels of the weak sequence, as shown

in  Figure  5.  Ωc

0  occupies  a  0th  order  level.  W±  occupies  a  1st  order  level.  The  K-mesons

occupy a 2nd order level, as does the exotic baryon θ+. Λ and Σ0 share a 3rd order level, as do

Ds

± ( sc ,  sc ; J = 0) and Ds*± (J = 1). The strange quark of Sequence 1, of mass 121 MeV,

occupies a 3rd order level.

Z0 occupies a 4th order level in the weak sequence. The neutral vector states Y, Bs*0 ( bs

), J/ψ

and φ, the muon and the tau lepton occupy levels in a symmetrical arrangement that includes

Z0, as shown in Figure 6.

5 Summary

First, we showed that quarks and baryons occupy the levels of a mass sequence (Sequence 1)

that  corresponds  to  a  lattice  in  an  extra  dimension.  Then,  we  showed  that  the  electron,  K-

mesons and weak gauge bosons occupy the  levels of a second mass  sequence  (Sequence  2)

that corresponds to a second lattice. By conjecturing that the two lattices lie in two directions

in  a  two-dimensional  extra  space,  and  that  domain  walls  extend  through  the  lattice  points,

partitioning  an  AdS  spacetime,  we  found  that  particle  masses  and  the  various  scales  of

physics correspond to the positions of domain wall intersections in the extra space, at equal

distances from the Planck brane in the two extra dimensions. The  masses  of  particles  of  all

types  considered  here  occupy  the  levels  of  a  ‘weak’  mass  sequence  that  descends  from  the

Higgs field VEV and is incorporated within Sequence 1.

Abstract

Particle channeling in a bent crystal lattice has led to an efficient instrument for beam steering at accelerators

[1],  demonstrated  from  MeV  to  TeV  energies.  In  particular,  crystal  focusing  of  high  energy  protons  to

micron  size  has  been  demonstrated  at  IHEP  with  the  results  well  in  match  with  Lindhard  (critical  angle)

prediction. Channeling in crystal microstructures has been proposed as a unique source of a microbeam of

high-energy  particles  [2].  Channeling  in  nanostructures  (single-wall  and  multi-wall  nanotubes)  offers  the

opportunities to produce ion beams on nanoscale. Particles channeled in a nanotube (with typical diameter of

about 1 nanometer) are trapped in two dimensions and can be steered (deflected, focused) with the efficiency

similar  to  that  of  crystal  channeling  or  better.  This  technique  has  been  a  subject  of  computer  simulations,

with experimental efforts under way in several high energy labs, including IHEP. We present the theoretical

outlook  for  making  channeling-based  nanoscale  ion  beams  and  report  the  experience  with  crystal-focused

microscale proton beams.

Keywords: Channeling, nanotube, microbeam, nanobeam.

1. Introduction

In the past decade, the technique of particle beam channeling by bent crystals has well progressed into an

established beam instrument at GeV accelerators [1]. Remarkably, it was demonstrated in the energy range

spanning over six decades [3-15], from 3 MeV [6,7] to 900 GeV [8-10]. IHEP Protvino has pioneered the

wide practical use of bent crystals as optical elements in high-energy beams for beam extraction and

deflection on permanent basis since 1989. In the course of IHEP experiments, crystal channeling has been

developed into efficient instrument for particle steering at accelerators, working in predictable, reliable

manner with beams of very high intensity over years [11-13,16,17]. Crystal systems extract 70 GeV protons
from IHEP main ring with efficiency of 85% at intensity of 1012 proton per spill (of about 1 s duration),

steered by silicon crystal of just 2 mm in length [12]. One of the crystals was exposed for several minutes to
even higher radiation flux of 70 GeV protons, about ~1014 proton hits per spill of 50 ms with repetition

period of 9.6 s. After the exposure, the channeling properties of the crystal were found normal as shows

photo in Fig. 1.

 Today, six locations on the IHEP 70-GeV main ring of the accelerator facility are equipped by crystal

extraction systems, serving mostly for routine applications rather than for research and allowing a

simultaneous run of several particle physics experiments, thus significantly enriching the IHEP physics

program. One crystal served in the vacuum chamber of the IHEP U-70 over 10 years, from 1989 to 1999,

delivering beam to particle physicists, until a new crystal replaced it. The long successful history of large-

scale crystal exploitation at IHEP should help to incorporate channeling crystals into accelerator systems

worldwide in order to create unique systems for beam creation and delivery.

2. Crystal focusing experiment

Following the successful application of bent crystals as miniature “dipoles” for beam bending, an

experiment started at IHEP aiming to show that crystal could also focus a particle beam. The idea of crystal

focusing [18-21] is explained by Fig. 2. The deflection angle any particle obtains in the crystal should be a

function of particle’s transverse coordinate so as to make all channeled particles cross the focus some

distance downstream of the crystal. A series of focusing crystals was made with focus lengths F from 0.5 to

3.5 m and tested in 70 GeV proton beam [19-21].

Fig. 3 shows the image at the crossover of the beam focused (and deflected) by the crystal with F=0.5 m.

The profile of the deflected and focused beam can be seen on the left. The dashed rectangle on the right is

the crystal cross-section. In this example, the measured beam size in the focus is just 21 micron r.m.s. Table

1 provides the measured data for three tested crystals. It shows also the expected beam size given by the

divergence of channeled particles (Lindhard angle) times the focus length. Remarkably, for two of the

crystals the predicted and measured data are well in match; for the third crystal, with the shortest focus, the

aberration in size is seen.

3. Nanotube channeling

There has been large interest recently [22-26] to possibility of channeling in the materials produced by

nanotechnology. Carbon nanotubes are cylindrical molecules with a typical diameter of order 1 nm for

single-wall nanotubes (SWNT) or a few tens nm for multi-wall nanotubes (MWNT) and a length of many

microns [27]. They are made of carbon atoms and can be thought of as a graphene sheet rolled around a

cylinder, Fig.4. Creating efficient channeling structures - from single crystals to nanotubes  - might have a

significant effect onto the accelerator world. Ideally, we would like to trap particles in two dimensions; to

have the channel walls made of densely packed atoms; to make channel size of our choice; to build it with

atoms of our choice. This is indeed close to what we get from nanotechnology nowadays.

The potential within a nanotube is localised very close to the wall, Fig. 5 (a). Essential for steering of

particles by nanotube is how the potential well modifies by centrifugal term with bending of nanotube. Fig. 5

(b) reveals that much of the nanotube cross-section is still available for channeling even with bending of

pv/R=1 GeV/cm (equivalent to 300 Tesla), R being the bending radius, pv particle momentum times

velocity. For understanding of bending dechanneling in nanotubes of different size and geometry, we did

Monte Carlo simulations of particle channeling in bent single-wall and multi-wall nanotubes, aiming to find

how useful are the nanotubes for channeling of positively-charged particle beams, what kind of nanotubes

are efficient for this job, and how nanotubes compare with crystals in this regard. The particles were tracked

through the curved nanotubes in the approach with a continuous potential described in more detail elsewhere

[28]. Fig. 6 shows the number of the channeled protons as a function of the nanotube curvature pv/R for

MWNT and SWNT (0.4-nm diameter), and for Si (110) crystal. This comparison shows that steering

capabilities of different channeling structures are similar, for the range of parameters shown in the Figure.

4. Emittance of nanobeam

Two approaches to making a small beam by means of channeling can be pursued. One can trap a small

fraction of the incident beam and steer it away in order to form a low-emittance beam with well-defined

sharp edges that contains solely primary particles. Another possibility would be to arrange a focusing array

of bent channeling nanotubes and focus (in two dimensions) the channeled particles into a small spot; this

focusing approach is certainly much more challenging technologically, therefore we restrict the discussion

below to the first approach. The possibility to deflect the trapped nanobeam out of the direction of primary

beam is a clear advantage over a passive capillary collimation used in microbeam facilities.

The size of a channeled nanobeam is set by the size of channeling nanostructure. The diameter of a

typical SWNT is about 1 nm (the narrowest one is about 0.4 nm); the diameter of a rope of SWNTs is

usually about 30 nm. The external diameter of MWNT is 30-50 nm.

The depth U0 of the potential well determines the angular divergence of the channeled beam. The critical

angle for channeling is about θc=(2U0/pv) 1/2. In a carbon nanotube with an arbitrary helicity the channeled

particles are confined in a potential well with U0 ≈ 60 eV. This figure doesn’t depend practically on the size

of the channel, as the atomic field within the nanotube falls off sharply in a close vicinity of the wall already.

Therefore, the emittance of the nanobeam formed by a single channeling SWNT could start from about

0.001 π nm•radian in a 100 MeV range, or 0.1 π nm•radian in a 1 MeV range.

With small emittance, the intensity of nanobeam would also be small. The effects of thermal shock and

radiation damage, eventually reducing the structure lifetime, may restrict the intensity also. The IHEP
experience shows that crystals can channel up to ~3·1012 particles/s per cross-section of 0.5×5 mm2 without

cooling measures. For nanostructures there is not enough data, although damage processes are being

evaluated [29]. However crystals show a huge margin of safety in lattice lifetime and thus raise hope for

similar stability of nanostructures. The above figure for crystal survival corresponds to the intensity of

106/(s·µm2)=1/(s·nm2). Extrapolating, we would expect a 1-nm-sized SWNT to channel 1 proton/s without

problem, or a 30-nm-sized nano-rope or MWNT to channel 1000 proton/s. This is interesting enough; the

applications like microbeam facilities often require quite small intensities, down to 1-1000 particles/s. A
lifetime of  ~5·1020 proton irradiation per cm2 was measured [5] for channeling crystal. This corresponds to
5·106/nm2 and means almost a year of continuous operation of nanobeam at 1 proton per nm2 per second.

5. Conclusion

Crystal channeling is a well-developed beam instrument nowadays. The nanotube channeling is already

well understood by theory. From physics standpoint, it is possible to make nano-beams by means of

channeling. However, this is challenging task for technology. With strong user demand, this field may grow

indeed from academic research to application.

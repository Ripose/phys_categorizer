Quantum electrodynamics is the well-accepted theory. However, we feel it is
useful  to  look  at  formalisms  that  provide  alternative  ways  to  describe  light,
because in the recent years the development of quantum field theories based
primarily  on  the  gauge  principle  has  encountered  considerable  difficulties.
There  is  a  wide  variety  of  generalized  theories,  and  they  are  characterized
mainly  by  the  introduction  of  additional  parameters  and/or  longitudinal
modes of electromagnetism. The Majorana-Oppenheimer form of electrody-
namics, the Sachs theory of Elementary Matter, the analysis of the action-at-
a-distance  concept,  presented  recently  by  Chubykalo  and  Smirnov-Rueda,
and the analysis of the claimed ‘longitudinality’  of the antisymmetric tensor
field  after  quantization  are  reviewed  in  this  essay.  We  also  list  recent  ad-
vances  in  the  Weinberg  2(2J  +  1)  formalism  (which  is  built  on  First  Princi-
ples)  and  in  the  Majorana  theory  of  neutral  particles.  These  may  serve  as
starting points for constructing a quantum theory of light.

Maxwell’s  electromagnetic  theory  perfectly  describes  many  observed  phenomena.

The  accuracy  of  the  predictions  of  quantum  electrodynamics  is  without  precedent  [1].
These are widely accepted as the only tools for dealing with electromagnetic phenomena.
Other  modern  field  theories  have  been  built  on  the  basis  of  similar  principles  to  treat
weak, strong and gravitational interactions. Nevertheless, many scientists have felt a cer-
tain dissatisfaction with both of these theories, almost since their inception, see, e.g., refs.
[2] and refs. [4-6]. In the preface to the Dover edition of his book [7] A. Barut writes (1979):
“Electrodynamics and the classical theory of fields remain very much alive and continue
to  be  the  source  of  inspiration  for  much  of  the  modern  research  work  in  new  physical
theories.”  And in the preface to the first edition he speaks of the shortcomings of modern
quantum field theory. These are well known. Furthermore, in spite of great expectations
in the sixties and seventies after the proposal of the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg model and
quantum  chromodynamics,  attempts  to  formulate  a  unified  field  theory  based  on  the
gauge principle have run into serious difficulties.

At  the  end  of  the  nineties,  we  now  have  considerable  experimental  data  at  our dis-
posal which are not satisfactorily explained on the basis of the standard model. First of all,
we may single out the following: the LANL neutrino oscillation experiment; the atmos-
pheric  neutrino  anomaly,  the  solar  neutrino  puzzle  (all  of  the  above-mentioned  imply

existence of the neutrino mass); the tensor coupling in decays of p–– and K+ mesons; the
dark matter problem; the observed periodicity of the number distribution of galaxies, and
the  ‘spin crisis’ 
in  QCD.  Added  to  this  are  experiments  and  observations  involving su-
perluminal  phenomena:  negative  mass-square  neutrinos,  tunnelling  photons,  X-shaped
waves and superluminal expansion in quasars and galactic objects.

In the meantime, since the time the Lorentz-Poincaré-Einstein Theory of Relativity [8]
was proposed and the mathematical formalism of the Poincaré group [9] was introduced,
many physicists (including A. Einstein, W. Pauli and M. Sachs) have felt that in order to
build a reliable theory (which would be based on relativistic ideas) one must  utilize the
irreducible  representations  of  the  underlying  symmetry  group—the  Poincaré  group  of
special relativity—and the Principle of Causality,  i.e. it must be built from first principles.
Considerable effort has been made recently in this direction [10-17]. Since the prediction
and discovery of an additional phase-free variable, spin, which all observed fundamental
particles have, finding its classical analogue and relating it to known fields and/or space-
time structures (perhaps in higher dimensions) has been one of the chief tasks of physi-
cists.  Understanding  the  nature  of  mass,  the  parity  violation  effect  on  the  kinematical
level and the reasons for the different scales of different interactions has been on the list
as well. We can now say that some progress has been achieved. At the end of this intro-
ductory part we note that although the Ultimate Theory has not yet been proposed, the
recent papers of D. V. Ahluwalia, M. W. Evans*, E. Recami and several other works pro-
vide a sufficiently clear way to this goal.

We  deal  first  with  the  historical  development  and  ideas  that  may  prove  useful  in

making further progress.

E = 0 solutions. First of all, I would like to mention the problem of existence of ‘acausal’
solutions of relativistic wave equations of the first order. In ref. [10] and then in [11] the
author, D. V. Ahluwalia, found that massless equations of the form†

have  acausal  dispersion  relations,  see  Table  2  in  [10].  In  the  case  of  the  spin  j = 1  this
manifests in existence of the solution with the energy  E = 0. Some time ago we learned
that the same problem has been discussed by J. R. Oppenheimer [18], S. Weinberg [19b]
and E. Gianetto [20c]. For instance, Weinberg has indicated that

right- handed  neutrino  fields,  while  for  j = 1  they  are  just  Maxwell’s  free- space
equations for left-  and right- circularly polarized radiation:

† Here and below in this historical essay we try to keep the notation and the metric of original papers.

Although I frequently disagree with Dr. M.W. Evans, his main idea is reasonable.

The fact that these field equations are of first order for any spin seems to me to be of
no great significance, since in the case of massive particles we can get along perfectly
well with (2j+ 1)–component fields which satisfy only the Klein- Gordon equation.”

This is obviously a remarkable and bold conclusion by this great physicist.

Oppenheimer was also concerned with the E = 0 solution [p.729,730,733,735] [18] and
he indicated at its connection with the electrostatic solutions of Maxwell’s equations. “In
the absence of charges there may be no such field.”  At first sight this seems contradictory:
free-space Maxwell’s  equations  do  not  contain re  or  rm  terms,  the  charge  densities,  but
dispersion relations still tell us about the solution E = 0. He deals further with the matters
of relativistic invariance of the matrix equation (p. 733) and suggests that the components
of y  (fR,L in the notation of [10,11]) transform under pure Lorentz transformations like the
space components of a covariant 4-vector. This induces him to extend the matrices and
the  wave  functions  to  include  the  fourth  component.  A  similar  formulation  was  devel-
oped by Majorana [20]. If so, it would be already difficult to consider fR,L as Helmoltz bi-
vectors because they have different laws for pure Lorentz transformations. What does the
4-component function (and its space components) correspond to? Finally, he indicated (p.
728) that ct, the angular momentum matrices, and the corresponding density-flux vector
may “play in some respects the part of the velocity”, with eigenvalues 0, – c. Thus, in my
opinion, the formula (5) of the paper [18] may have some relations with the discussion of
the convection displacement current in [3], see below.

Finally, M. Moshinsky and A. Del Sol found a solution of similar nature in a two-body
relativistic problem [21]. Of course, it is connected with earlier considerations, e.g., with
the problem of the relative time in the quasipotential approach. In order to try to under-
stand the physical sense of the E = 0 solutions and the corresponding field components,
let us consider other generalizations of the Maxwell formalism.

The ‘baroque’ 
formalism. In this formalism, proposed in the fifties by K. Imaeda [22] and T.
Ohmura  [23],  who  intended  to  solve  the  problem  of  electron  stability,  additional  scalar
and  pseudoscalar  fields  are  introduced  in  Maxwell’s  theory. Monopoles  and  magnetic
currents are also present in this theory. The equations become the following:

“Each of E and H is separated into two parts E(1) + E(2) and H(1) + H(2): one is the solu-
tion of the equations with j,s, h zero, and other is the solution of the equations with i, r, e
zero.”  Furthermore,  T.  Ohmura  indicated  the  existence  of  longitudinal  photons  in  her
model: “It will be interesting to test experimentally whether the g-ray keeps on its trans-
verse property even in the high energy region as derived from the Maxwell theory or it
does not as predicted from our hypothesis.”  In fact, equations (3a)-(3d) can be written in
matrix  notation,  which  leads  to  the  known  Majorana-Oppenheimer  formalism  for  the
(0,0) ¯

field is connected somehow with the sources which created it [Eq.(5.21)] [25]. Moreover, it
was mentioned in this work that even after the switchoff of the sources, the localized field
can possess the longitudinal component (Example 2). Then, he made a convention which,
in my opinion, is required to give more rigorous scientific basis: “…y A is not suitable for a
final field because it is not purely transverse. Hence we shall subtract the part whose di-
vergence is not zero.”

Finally, we should mention ref. [26]. The proposed formalism is connected with the
formalism  of  the  previously  cited  works  (and  with  the  massive  Proca  theory).  Two  of
Maxwell’s equations remain unchanged, but one has additional terms in two other ones:

where l is of the dimensions length and is suggested by Lyttleton and Bondi to be of the
order of the radius of the Universe.  A and  V are the vector and scalar potentials, which
put back into two Maxwell’s  equations  for  strengths.  So,  these  additional  terms  contain
information  about  possible  effects  of  the  photon  mass.  This  was  applied  to  explain  the
expansion of the Universe. The Watson generalization, also discussed in [26b], is based on
the introduction of the additional gradient current [as in Eqs. (3a, 3c)] and, in fact, repeats
in  essence  the  Majorana-Oppenheimer  and  Imaeda-Ohmura  formulations.  On  a  scale
much smaller than a radius of the Universe, both formulations were shown by Chambers
to be equivalent. The difference obtained is of order l–2 at the most. In fact, both formula-
tions  were  noted  by  Chambers  to  be  able  to  describe  local  creation  of  the  charge.  The
question of the integral conservation of the charge over the volume still deserves elabora-
tion, the question of possibility to observe such a type of non-conservation as well. These
questions may be connected with the boundary conditions on the sphere of the radius l.

The theory of Elementary Matter. The formalism proposed by M. Sachs [27,28] is on the basis
of the consideration of “spinorial”  functions composed of 3-vector components:

…  Eq. (12) is not equivalent to the less general form of Maxwell’s equations. That is
to say the spinor equations (12) are not merely a rewriting of the vector form of the
field equations, they are a true generalization in the sense of transcending the pre-
dictions of the older form while also agreeing with all of the correct predictions of the

For instance, these equations could serve as a basis for describing parity-violating in-
teractions [27a], and can account for the spin-spin interaction as well from the beginning
[27d,p.934].  The  formalism  was  applied  to  explain  several  puzzles  in  neutrino  physics.
The connection with the  Pauli  Exclusion  Principle  was  revealed.  The  theory,  when  the
interaction (‘matter field labeling’) is included, is essentially bi-local.‡

“What was discovered in this research program, applied to the particle-antiparticle
pair, was that an exact solution for the coupled field equations for the pair, in its rest
frame, gives rise (from  Noether’s  theorem)  to  a  prediction  of  null  energy,  momen-
tum and angular momentum, when it is in this particular bound state.”  [28]

Later [28] this type of equations was written in the quaternion form with the continu-
ous function  m l= h c  identified with the inertial mass. Thus, an extension of the model
to the general relativity case was proposed.  Physical  consequences  of  the  theory  are:  a)
the  formalism  predicts  while  small  but  non-zero  masses  and  the  infinite  spectrum  of
neutrinos; b) the Planck spectral distribution of black body radiation follows; c) the hy-
drogen spectrum (including the Lamb shift) was deduced; d) bases for the charge quanti-
zation are proposed; e) the lifetime of the muon state was predicted; f) the electron-muon
mass splitting was discussed,

“…the difference in the mass  eigenvalues  of  a  doublet  depends  on  the  alteration  of
the geometry of space-time in the vicinity of excited pairs of the ‘physical vacuum’
[‘a degenerate gas of spin-zero objects,’ 
longitudinal and scalar photons, in fact! V.
V.  D.]—leading,  in  turn,  to  a  dependence  of  the  ratio  of  mass  eigenvalues  on  the
fine-structure constant”.

That was impressive work and these are impressive results!

Quantum  mechanics  of  phase.  A.  Staruszkiewicz  [29,30]  considers  the Lagrangian  and  the
action of a potential formulation for the electromagnetic field, which include a longitudi-
nal part:

S is a scalar field called the phase. As a matter of fact, this formulation was shown to be a
development  of  the  Dirac-Fock-Podol’sky  model  in  which  the  current  is  a  gradient  of
some scalar field [31]:

Again we see a gradient current and, therefore, the Dirac-Fock-Podol’sky model is a sim-
plified  version  (apparently  without  monopoles)  of  the  more  general  Majorana-
Oppenheimer theory.  Staruszkiewicz  posed  the  following  questions  [30],  see  also  [23b]
and [32]: “Is it possible to have a system, whose motion is determined completely by the
charge  conservation  law  alone?  Is  it  possible  to  have  a  pure  charge  not  attached  to  a
nonelectromagnetic  piece  of  matter?”  and  answering  came  to  the  conclusion  “that  the
Maxwell electrodynamics of a gradient current is a closed dynamical system.”  The inter-
pretation of a scalar field as a phase of the expansion motion of a charge under repulsive
electromagnetic  forces  was  proposed.  “They  [the Dirac-Fock-Podol’sky  equations]  de-
scribe a charge let loose by removal of the Poincaré stresses.”  The phase was then related
with the vector potential by means of [30e,p.902]

Formula  (16)  is  reminiscent  to  the  Barut  self-field  electrodynamics  [33].  This  should  be
investigated by taking the 4-divergence of Barut’s anzatz.

Next,  the  operator  of  a  number  of  zero-frequency  photons  was  studied.  The  total
charge of the system, found on the basis of the Noether theorem, was connected with the
change  of  the  phase  between  the  positive  and  the  negative  time-like  infinity:

. Questions of fixing the factor g

by appropriate physical conditions were also answered. Finally, the Coulomb field was
decomposed  into  irreducible  unitary  representations  of  the  proper  orthochronous  Lor-
entz  group  [34].  Both  representations  of  the  main  series  and  the  supplementary  series
were  regarded.  In  my  opinion,  this  research  can  help  to  understand  the  nature  of  the
charge and of the fine structure constant.

Invariant evolution parameter. The theory of electromagnetic field with an invariant evolu-
tion parameter (t , the Newtonian time) has been worked out by L. P. Horwitz [35-37]. It
is a development of the Stueckelberg formalism [38] and I consider this theory as an im-
portant step to understanding the nature of our space-time. The Stueckelberg equation

classical analogue of antiparticle (which, in fact, has been later used by R. Feynman) and

of the theory based on the  Stueckelberg-Schrödinger equation (17) one arrives at the 5-

The underlying symmetry of the theory can be O(3,2) or O(4,1) “depending on the choice
of  metric  for  the  raising  and  lowering  of  the  fifth  (t)  index  [35]”.  For Minkowski-space
components the equation (18) is reduced to  ¶

recovered after integrating over t from –¥

The formalism has been applied mainly in the study of the many-body problem and in
the  measurement  theory,  namely,  bound  states  (the  hydrogen  atom),  the  scattering
problem, the calculation of the selection rules and amplitudes for  radiative decays, a co-
variant  Zeeman  effect,  the  Landau-Peierls  inequality.  Two  crucial  experiments  which
may check validity and may distinguish the theory from ordinary approaches have also
been proposed [p.15] [37].

Furthermore, one should mention that in the framework of the special relativity ver-
sion of the  Feynman-Dyson proof of the Maxwell’s equations [39] S. Tanimura  came  to
rather unexpected conclusions [40] which are related with the formulation defended by
L. Horwitz. Trying to prove the Maxwell’s formalism S. Tanimura arrived at the conclu-
sion about a theoretical possibility of its generalization. According to his consideration the

the low-energy limit ( M ﬁ

) the theory is equivalent to the standard one.

Action-at-a-distance. In the paper [42] A. E.  Chubykalo and R.  Smirnov-Rueda argued on
the basis of the analysis of the Cauchy problem of the D’Alembert and Poisson equations
that  one  should  revive  the  concept  of  the  instantaneous  action-at-a-distance  in  classical
electrodynamics. The essential feature of the formalism is in introduction of two types of
field functions, with the explicit and implicit dependencies on time. The energy of longi-
tudinal modes in this formulation cannot be stored locally in the space, the spread veloc-
ity may be whatever and so, they believe, that one has also  E = 0. The new convection
displacement  current  was  proposed  in  [3]  on  the  basis  of  the  development  of  this  wis-
dom.  It  has  a  form  j disp
these ideas have been defended by T. E.  Phipps, Jr.) to replace the partial derivative by
the total derivative in the Maxwell’s equations. In my opinion, one can also reveal some
connections  with  the  Majorana-Oppenheimer  formulation  following  to  the  analysis  of
ref. [p.728] [18].

F. Belinfante [43a] appears to come even earlier to the Sachs’ 

idea about the “physical

vacuum”  as pairs of some particles from a very different viewpoint. In his formulation of
the  quantum-electrodynamic  perturbation  theory  zero-order  approximation  is  deter-
mined in which scalar and longitudinal photons are present in pairs. He also considered
[43b]  the  Coulomb  problem  in  the  frameworks  of  the  quantum  electrodynamics  and
proved  that  the  signal  can  be  transmitted  with  the  velocity  greater  than c.  So,  this  old
work  appears  to  be  in  accordance  with  recent  experimental  data  (particularly,  with  the
claims of G. Nimtz et al. [44] about a wave packet propagating faster than c through a bar-
rier, which was used “to transmit Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 through a tunnel of 114 mm
length  at  a  speed  of  4.7c”).  As  indicated  by  E. Recami  in  a  private  communication  the
E = 0 solutions can be put in correspondence to a tachyon of the infinite velocity.
Evans-Vigier B(3) field. In a recent series of remarkable papers (in FPL, FP, Physica A and B,
Nuovo Cimento B) and books M. Evans and J.-P. Vigier  have  indicated  the  possibility  of
consideration of the longitudinal B(3) field for describing many electromagnetic phenom-
ena and in cosmological models as well [12]. It is connected with transverse modes

some  isovector  space.  “The  conventional O(2)  gauge  geometry  is  replaced  by  a  non-
Abelian O(3) gauge geometry and the Maxwell equations are thereby generalized”  in this
approach. Furthermore, some success in the problem of the unification of gravitation and
electromagnetism  has  been  achieved  in  recent  papers  by  M.  Evans  [45].  It  has  been
pointed out by several authors, e.g.,[13,46] that this field is the simplest and most natural
(classical)  representation  of  a  particles  spin,  the  additional  phase-free  discrete  variable
discussed by Wigner [9]. The consideration by Y. S. Kim et al., see ref. [47a,formula (14)],
ensures  that  the  problem  of  physical  significance  of  the  Evans-Vigier-type  longitudinal
modes is related with the problem of the normalization and of existence of the mass of a
particle transformed on the (1,0) ¯
(0,1) representation of the Poincaré group. Considering
explicit  forms  of  the  (1,0) ¯
quantum field theory of this representation (the Weinberg-Soper formalism) D. V. Ahlu-
walia  and  M.  Sawicki  [15a]  showed  that  in  the  massless  limit  one  has  only  two  non-
vanishing Dirac-like solutions. The “bispinor”  corresponding to the longitudinal solution
is directly proportional to the mass of the particle. So, the massless limit of this theory, the
relevance of the E(2) group to describing physical phenomena and the problem of what is
mass deserve further research.

in  the  light-front  formulation  [49]  of  the

(0,1)  “bispinors” 

The idea of longitudinal modes related with the electromagnetic field is not so new as
it appears at the present time. E. T. Whittaker in the beginning of the century [48] consid-
ered  the  general  solution  of  the  D’Alembert  wave  equation  and concluded  that  “the
functions which define the resulting electrodynamic field …  can be expressed in terms of
the  derivatives  of  two  scalar  potential  functions”.  The  direction  of  corresponding  vectors
may be chosen in such a way that they are aligned themselves. The physically observable
fields are then

where d and h are the electric and magnetic vectors. The field created by arbitrary mov-

“longitudinal”  functions f and g (with magnitudes |f| = F, |g| = G) may be related to the

Reducing the Whittaker’s general solution to the plane wave (which are in overall use) is
straightforward from his formulation.

Antisymmetric tensor fields. To the best of my knowledge, modern research into  antisym-
metric tensor fields in the quantum theory began from the paper by V. I. Ogievetskii and
I.  V.  Polubarinov  [50].  They  claimed  that  the  antisymmetric  tensor  field  (notoph  in  the

                                                       
** Compare this formula with the dynamical equations of the antisymmetric tensor field, e.g., ref.[46,60]. It in-
duces speculations about possible significance of the normalization of the corresponding functions of the
momentum representation.

and  applications  of  the  supplementary  conditions.  The  result  by Ogievetskii  and Polu-

after the application of the  Fermi method  mutatis mutandis (comparing with the case of
the 4-vector potential field) yields the spin dynamical invariant to be equal to zero. While
several authors insisted on the “transversality”  of the antisymmetric tensor field and the
necessity  of  gauge-independent  consideration  [54-56]  perpetually  this  interpretation
(‘longitudinality’) has become wide-accepted. In refs. [57,58] an antisymmetric tensor mat-
ter field was studied and it appears to be also “longitudinal”, but to have two degrees of
freedom. Unfortunately, the authors of the cited work regarded only a massless real field
and did not take into account the physical reality of the dual field corresponding to an
antiparticle. But, what is important, L. Avdeev and M. Chizhov noted [58] that in such a
¢d -type transverse solutions, which cannot be interpreted as rela-
framework there exist 
tivistic particles.

If the antisymmetric tensor field would be pure longitudinal, it appears failure to un-
derstand, why in the classical electromagnetism we are convinced that an antisymmetric
tensor field is a transverse field. This induces speculations about the incorrectness of the
Correspondence Principle. Moreover, this result contradicts with the  Weinberg theorem
B – A = l, ref. [19b]. This situation has been later  analyzed in refs. [59,13,60,46,61]  and it
was  found  that  indeed  the  “longitudinal  nature”  of antisymmetric  tensor  fields  is  con-
nected with the application of the  generalized Lorentz condition to the quantum states:
¶ mFmn|Y > = 0.  Such  a  procedure  leads  also  (like  in  the  case  of  the  treatment  of  the  4-
vector potential field without proper regarding the phase field) to the problem of the in-
definite metric which was noted by  Gupta and  Bleuler. So, it is already obviously from
methodological  viewpoints  that  the  grounds  for  regarding  only  particular  cases  can  be
doubted  by  the  Lorentz  symmetry  principles.  Ignoring  the  phase  field  of  Dirac-Fock-
Podol’sky-Staruszkiewicz  or  ignoring c  functions  [62]  related  with  the  4-current  and,
hence, with the possible non-zero vacuum value of ¶ mFmn can put obstacles on the way of
creation  of  the  unified  field  theory  and  embarrass  understanding  the  physical  content
dictated by the Relativity Theory. This is my opinion.

The Weinberg formalism. In the beginning of the sixties the 2(2j+1)- component approach
has been proposed in order to construct a Lorentz-invariant interaction S-matrix from the
first principles [63,64,19,65-68]. The authors had thus some hopes on adequate perturba-
tion calculus for processes including higher-spin particles which appeared in the disposi-
tion of physicists in that time. The field theory in that time was in some troubles.

For massless particles the  Weinberg theorem about connections between the  helicity
of  a  particle  and  the  representation  of  the  group  (A,B)  which  the  corresponding  field
transforms on has been proved. It says:

“A massless particle operator a(p, l) of helicity l can only be used to construct fields
which transform according to representations (A, B), such that B – A = l. For in-
stance, a left-circularly polarized photon with  l = –1 can be associated with (1,0),
( 3
2 ,½), (2,1)…  fields, but  not with the vector potential, (½,½)… [It is not the case
of a massive particle.] A field can be constructed out of 2j + 1 operators a(p, s ) for
any representation (A, B) that “contains”  j, such that j = A + B, or A + B – 1… or

|A – B|,  [e.g.,  a  j = 1  particle  massive]  field  could  be  a  four-vector  (½,½)…[i.e.,
built out of the vector potential ].”

In  subsequent  papers Weinberg  showed  that  it  is  possible  to  construct  fields  trans-
formed on other representations of the  Lorentz group but unlikely can be considered as
fundamental  ones.  The  prescription  for  constructing  the  fields  have  been  given  in  ref.
[19c,p.1895].

“Any irreducible field y (A,B) for a particle of spin j may be constructed by applying a
suitable differential operator of order 2B to the field  y (j,0), provided that A, B, and j
satisfy the triangle inequality |A – B | = j = A + B.”

¶ mFmn,  the  (0,1)
For example, from the self-dual  antisymmetric tensor  F
field  emnlr¶ l¶ sFrs  have  been  constructed.  Moreover,  various  invariant-type  interactions
have been tabulated [19b,p.B890] and [19c,Section III]. While one can also use fields from
different representations of the Lorentz group to obtain some physical predictions, in my
opinion,  such  a  wisdom  could  lead  us  to  certain  mathematical  inconsistencies  (like  the
indefinite  metric  problem  and  the  subtraction  of  infinities  [4]).  The  applicability  of  the
procedure mentioned above to massless states should still be analyzed in detail.

  the  (½,½)  field 

Finally, in another paper [66c] Weinberg wrote:

“Tensor fields cannot by themselves be used to construct the interaction H'(t)…  The
potentials are not tensor fields…  It is for this reason that some field theorists have
been  led  to  introduce  fictitious  photons  and  gravitons  of  helicity  other  than  –j,  as
well  as  the  indefinite  metric  that  must  accompany  them.  Preferring  to  avoid  such
unphysical monstrosities, we must ask now what sort of coupling we can give our
nontensor  potentials  without  losing  the  Lorentz  invariance  of  the  S  matrix?…
Those in which the potential is coupled to a conserved current.”

Thus, he tried to provide some basis to the gauge models from the Lorentz invariance. In
the recent book [69] he slightly changed his views:

“Interactions in such a theory [constructed from fmn and its derivatives] will have a
rapid  fall-off  at  large  distances,  faster  than  the  usual  inverse-square  law.  This  is
perfectly possible, but…  theories that use vector fields for  massless spin one particles
represent a more general class of theories…”

My opinion is: all reliable theories must have well-defined massless limit and be in ac-
cordance  with  the  Weinberg  theorem.  While  many  recipes  were  developed  to  handle
with  interactions  mediated  by  virtual  particles  described  by  the  4-vector  potential,  the
questions, which theories “are actually realized in nature”  and which is the more general
theory, remain to be opened.

We  have  reached  this  conclusion  on  the  basis  of  our  development  of  the Weinberg
theory [19,66] and its reformulation by A. Sankaranarayanan [70];†† of the Majorana con-

                                                       
†† Unfortunately, the author of the cited work did not realized in 1965 himself that his equation describes parti-

cles with different physical properties compared with the initial Weinberg formulation.

cept of the neutrality [71] and its reformulation by J. A. McLennan and K. M. Case [72];
and after reading the important work of B.  Nigam and L.  Foldy [73] and useful sugges-
tions  of  the  referee  [11]  of  the  work  [14b].  Here  we  are  not  going  to  discuss  our  recent
work in detail and only list some important results:

In such a framework a boson and its antiboson have opposite intrinsic parities [14]. The
conclusion was also reached in the  Fock  space.  The  essential  feature  in  deriving  the
equation  (ref.  [70])  in  ref.  [14]  was  the  Ryder-Burgard  relation  in  the  form fR = – fL.
The presented theory [14b] is the first explicit example of the theory of the Bargmann-
Wightman-Wigner type [9b].
• The concept of the  complex (1,0) ¯

 (0,1) fields as parts of the degenerate doublet was
proposed (ref. [60] and private communication from D. V.  Ahluwalia). The represen-
tation is spanned by the two six-component functions in the coordinate space (e.g., y 1
~
and g5y 1, or Fmn and 
F mn ). The mapping between the antisymmetric tensor and Wein-
berg  formulations  has  been  found.  Properties  of  the  field  functions  with  respect  to
P ”
 g44 operation have been studied. The dynamical  invariants for the  Weinberg field
[60] and for the antisymmetric tensor field [46] have been obtained.

• The boson-boson interaction amplitude appears to be very similar [74] to the fermion-
fermion  amplitude  in  the  second  order  of  the  Feynman  perturbation  theory  if  one
works in the Lobachevsky momentum space. The only difference is that the denomi-
f . The spin structure of
nator in the former has to be changed:  1
the  numerator  remains  to  be  unchanged.  ( D
)  is  the  4-vector  of  the  momentum
transfer in the Lobachevsky space, see, e.g., ref. [75].

• The Majorana-Oppenheimer formulation [see equations (5a,b)] has been  generalized

to the massive field case [76] by using some ideas of the paper [77].
• The relativistic covariance of the B- cyclic relations has been proven [78].
•

In  the  (½,0)  ¯
 (0,½)  representation  space  t he  self/anti-self  charge  conjugate  spinors
lS,A(pm) [and related to them  rS,A(pm)spinors] have been introduced [16]. One can note
interesting features of these spinors: they are not eigenspinors of the parity operator;
they are not eigenspinors of the helicity operator h of the (½,0)  ¯
 (0,½) representation
(but, the new operator –g5h of the chiral helicity was introduced); for massless particles
lAS A,
  identically  vanish;  they  form  bi-orthonormal  set  in  the  mathematical  sense  (see
formula  (41)  in  [16]).  In  the  (1,0) ¯
 (0,1)  representation  it  is  impossible  to  construct
self/anti-self charge conjugate objects in the similar way. But, the  eigenvectors of the

1S c

5

 operator have been introduced there [16].

• The Majorana representation (MR) and the corresponding unitary matrix  y M = Uy W
of the transfer to the MR have been defined [79]. In this representation lS and rA keep
to be pure real and lA and rS keep to be pure imaginary for both spin-½  and spin-1 case
(cf. [71]).

• On the basis of the generalization of the Ryder-Burgard relation (see the formula (11)
in [17b]) the dynamical equations in the covariant form have been derived in both the
(½,0)  ¯
 (0,1)  representation  spaces  [17].  The  explicit  form  of  these
“MAD”  equations in the j = ½  case is

A fermion and its antifermion appear to be able to carry the same intrinsic parities [80]
in  the  framework  of  the  similar  construction  in  the  Fock  space.  So,  the  Bargmann-
Wightman-Wigner-type quantum field theory [9b] can be realized in the (½,0)  ¯
 (0,½)
representation space too.

• Gauge transformations for the lS,A and rS,A spinors take the form, ref. [17b]

This induces a lot of speculations on the foundations of quantum mechanics.

• Constructs presented in refs. [81,82] seem to have similar physical content comparing
with the Majorana-Ahluwalia construct. The authors of [82] also proposed the doubling
of the  Fock space; investigated field functions which are not the  eigenvectors of the
parity operator, while are the eigenvectors of the operator of charge conjugation (de-
fined in a different way). They also regarded the  pseudoscalar charge. At last, they ar-
gued that “The usual ‘CP-mirror’  symmetry of the weak interaction should quite gener-
ally be re-interpretable as a pure P-mirror one. The result is that now the P-mirror image
+ + n   should  just  be  identified  with  the  actual  antiprocess
of  the  actual  process  n
+ + n .

• Finally, in the papers [83] it was shown that the solutions of the Maxwell equations
and the Klein-Gordon equation (and presumably other relativistic equations) are not
necessarily required to be plane waves.

description of first-order Doppler effects” (gr-qc/9807084)  

Eric Baird     February 2001  

Einstein’s  goal  of  producing  an  advanced  gravitational  model  that  was  independent  of  special 
relativity’s “non-gravitational” derivations has arguably still not been achieved. The author produced a 
paper  in  1998  outlining  a  possible  method  of  attack  on  the  problem  based  on  shift  equivalence 
principles (“Doppler mass shift”). Some problems with this paper have since  come to light. We list 
some  further  developments,  some  papers  not  cited  in  gr-qc/9807084,  some  experimental  results 
missed by the author, and identify a problem with the paper’s approach to aberration effects. 

1.   INTRODUCTION 

2.   ABERRATION PROBLEMS  

In April 1950, Einstein published an article in 
Scientific American stating his opinion that a full 
gravitational model should not depend on special 
relativity as a foundation [1] – while physics within 
flat spacetime is certainly very convenient [2], the 
simplifying assumption of inertial mass without 
gravitational mass is not a natural feature of more 
advanced gravitational models.  

Paper gr-qc/9807084 by this author “GR without 

SR” [3] described a paradigm intended to avoid 
special relativity’s “flat” geometry, with velocity-
dependent curvature between relatively-moving 
masses acting as a regulating mechanism for 
local lightspeed constancy (with conventional 
Doppler shifts appearing as gravitational-domain 
effects). The most suprising aspects of this 
alternative model were i) that it seemed to allow a 
different “relativistic” shift equation to that used by 
special relativity, and ii) that this altered 
relationship did not seem to generate the usual 
incompatibilities between classical and quantum 
models (“black hole information paradox” [4]), and 
still seemed to be compatible with all current 
experimental data.  

Since the first version of the paper was uploaded 

to the LANL archive, some problems have come 
to light, namely 

1. 

2. 

the paper’s accidental reversal of some 
aberration relationships and effects, and  

the omission of published experimental 
evidence supporting special relativity’s 
Doppler relationships.  

In this supplementary paper we document these 
problems, and also list some additional work that 
has been produced or become known to the 
author since September 1998.

A basic derivation of relativistic aberration effects 

for shift equations (1), (2) and (3) (as identified in 
[3] section 5.1) has shown that special relativity’s 
aberration formula [5], with its forward-tilted rays 
is a “general” relativistic result [6], and does not 
depend on the assumption of flat spacetime or on 
special relativity’s particular choice of Doppler 
equations.  

The paper therefore seems to be in error when it 
relates a rearward-observed redshift on a receding 
object to an apparent rearward concentration of 
fieldlines in a receding object – while the author’s 
calculated fieldline density-change ratios are 
probably correct, the actual relationship seems to 
be inversely proportional rather than directly 
proportional (it is easy to make this sort of 
accidental inversion when working with an 
“unexplored” model, e.g. Newton [7]).  

The correct argument would seem to be the one 

presented elsewhere in the paper for the inverse 
relationship between the object’s perception of 
environmental Doppler effects and of 
environmental fieldline density – the “moving” 
object sees more environmental mass ahead than 
behind, but the proposed Doppler mass shift 
effect acts to enhance the gravitational influence 
of aft (redshifted) masses and lessen the 
attraction of the forward (blueshifted) material – 
the Doppler effect acts against the calculated 
effect of aberration on fieldline density [8]. 

A recent piece by Carlip [9] has come to a 
broadly similar conclusion regarding the equal 
magnitude of displacement and aberration effects, 
with velocity components acting to make any 
supposed gravitational-field aberration effects 
undetectable.

3.   MISSED EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

3.1 
measurements 

“Transverse” tests using non-transverse 

From “GR without SR” [3] section 9.1: “While it 

may seem improbable that we have not yet been 
able to verify that the SR shift prediction (2) is more 
accurate than the earlier equation (1), the author has 
so far been unable to find any direct evidence 
favoring (2)”     

In fact, a number of experiments that are listed 
as tests of special relativity’s “transverse” redshift 
predictions are actually based on analysis of non-
transverse data (e.g. Ives-Stilwell [10]). These 
experiments had been missed because of their 
usual classification as  “transverse” tests [11]. 

At least two of the experiments listed in 

MacArthur’s review piece [11], [10][12] do lend 
themselves to reanalysis, and do appear to give a 
very good match to the predictions of (2) rather 
than (1), which seems to settle the issue in favour 
of special relativity. However, these experiments 
were carried out at a time when it seems to have 
been widely accepted that lab-transverse redshift 
effects could only be generated by (2) (“... no 
change in frequency.” [13] “classically one would not 
expect a frequency shift from a source that moves by 
right angles.” [14]), suggesting the possibility that 
an experimenter looking for either a null result or a 
Lorentz redshift might attribute an “inexplicable” 
double-strength redshift [15] to a combination of 
(2) and some additional redshifting effect in the 
apparatus (such as mirror recoil).

Since these experiments seem to be the only 

ones to date that give unequivocal support for 
special relativity’s choice of shift equation, it 
would be helpful if similar future experiments [16] 
could be designed to test for possible agreement 
with (1), as well as with (2) and (3) [17]. 

4.   ADDITIONAL REFERENCES AND 
FURTHER WORK 

4.1 

Black hole information paradox 

This paradox (Susskind review article [4]) has 

also been discussed in detail by Preskill, 
Danielson and Schiffer [18][19], and does not 
appear to apply to a physics based on (1). 
Unruh’s work on indirect radiation through signal 
horizons in non-SR models [20][21] described 
“sonic horizon” radiation as being an analogue of 
Hawking radiation. Visser has since presented 
this effect as a full Hawking radiation effect 
[22][23][24]. Visser’s paper appeared in the LANL 
archive after research for “GR without SR” had 
been completed. 

4.2 

Aberration and angle-dependent shifts 

The angle-changes and angle-dependent 
frequency-shifts associated with hypothetical 
relativistic models based on (1), (2) and (3) have 
now been calculated from general principles, 
without presupposing flat spacetime [6]. In this 
exercise, all three calculations generate the same 
aberration formula as special relativity [5], and 
generates the result that for any given laboratory 
angle, (2) predicts wavelengths that are Lorentz 
redshifted compared to (3), but (1) predicts 
wavelengths that are doubly Lorentz-shifted 
compared to (3) [6][15]. Lorentz relationships are 
often presented as being unique to (2) (but see 
Visser [25]).  
E=mc2 

4.3 

An exact derivation of the E=mc2 result from (1) 
for a pair of plane-waves aligned with the moving 
object’s path has now been given and discussed 
in [26]. The relationships given in [6] also let us 
apply this result to pairs of plane-waves emitted at 
any other angle. 

4.4 

Transverse effects 

The Lorentz-squared redshift predictions for a 
lab-transverse detector for (1) are general and 
apply to relativistic and non-relativistic 
calculations (see: Lodge’s 1893 “spurious or 
apparent Doppler” prediction [27]). Special 
relativity’s predictions are the root product of the 
predictions made for (1) and (3) not just for the 
non-transverse case [28], but also for any other 
angle defined in a given frame [29].

4.5 

Time dilation without acceleration 

6.   CONCLUSIONS 

Textbooks tend to suggest that muon 

pathlengths are only explainable using special 
relativity [30]. The mathematics indicates 
otherwise – for a muon created at the edge of the 
Earth’s atmosphere with a given rest mass, rest 
frame lifetime and momentum, the “new” 
calculated penetration depth under special 
relativity is the same as the older Newtonian 
prediction [15].  

Lab-transverse redshifts (“aberration redshifts”) 
already feature in a range of models that do not 
include physical time-dilation effects [15]. 

4.6 

Acceleration effects 

Acceleration of an object towards the observer 

introduces non-linear behaviour that is not 
compatible with flat-space approximations [31] 
(see also “acceleration radiation” and 
Bekenstein/Hawking radiation under more 
standard theory). A full gravitational description of 
the “twins" problem can run into similar problems 
under general relativity [32][33]. 

5.   WORK BY OTHER AUTHORS 

Matt Visser and W.G. Unruh have derived 

purely classical indirect radiation effects in 
transonic fluid flows, and identified these effects 
as Hawking radiation effects. This work would 
also seem to apply to indirect radiation through 
the r=2M surface in systems of physics based 
around shift equation (1).    

Steve Carlip has produced a study of the 

aberration-gravity problem, and related the lack of 
additional gravitational aberration effects to the 
existence of gravitational velocity components [9].  

S. Dinowitz has described a model that sounds 

similar in concept to the Doppler mass shift idea 
[34].  

Wolfgang Rindler has described how general 
relativity could (in theory) have been developed in 
the Nineteenth Century, independently of special 
relativity [35]. 

The sort of model described in [3] calls on 

several obscure areas of physics theory that have 
not yet been fully explored, because of 
complicating non-linearities or incompatibilities 
with special relativity. Progress in at least some 
of these areas is now being stimulated by work on 
the black hole information paradox.  

Experiments such as Ives/Stilwell indicate that 

Nature’s shift laws do obey (2) rather than (1), 
apparently invalidating this approach and making 
the existence of a possible non-SR solution to the 
information paradox irrelevant.  

However, these experiments were probably 
designed to differentiate between the “null shift” 
and “redshift” predictions of (2) and (3). If 
experimenters were not aware of the (largely 
undocumented) double Lorentz redshift 
predictions associated with (1), it is still 
conceivable that further experiments, designed to 
differentiate between (1) and (2), may still tip the 
balance of evidence towards the non-SR equation.

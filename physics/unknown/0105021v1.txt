In this work we obtained differential equations, describing interaction of electromagnetic field
with moving sidebars and surfaces, coming from integral electrodynamics laws. Herewith, it has been
shown that received differential equations contain but the such features of electromagnetic field as  E,
H, distributions  of  charges  and  currents,  as  well  as  features  of  surfaces,  to  which  sidebar  is  leaning,
changing its form with a time. These features are field of normals to surfaces N and field of velocities
of changing these normals with a time dN/dt.

We assume, that main laws of electromagnetic field are written in the integral form as follows

[1]:

1.  The First electrodynamics law. Flow of electrical field of the tension E through any closed
surface is equal to charge, disposed inside of the surface:

2.  The  Second  electrodynamics  law.  For  any  closed  curve  in  three-dimensional  space  a
(cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:224)
circulation of electrical field is equal to velocities of changing a flow of magnetic field  H through
the surface strained on this sidebar.

,  limited  by  the  closed  sidebar  L,
circulation of vector B along any closed regular curve equals to the velocity of changing of flow of
the tension of electrical field  E through any surface, leaning on this curve plus electrical current,
run through this surface.

However,  direct  using  of  Stocks  and  Gauss  formulae  for  cases,  when  type  of  surface,  the
velocity  of  changing  of  flow  to  be  find  through,  depends  on  time  here  are  not  applicable,  since  it  is
impossible to change places of operation of integrating on surfaces and differentiation on a time.

Moreover u and v already are already independent on time. Note that if we use a dependency from time
of surface S
 in the manner of more complex than (8) then it brings to difficulties, for details that we

Considering this example it was important to fix a surface, covering by the loop in the manner
of  (1),  which  shows  that  this  piece  of  surface  is  being  sprained  or  compressed  and  hence  produce
expansion or compression of ambience (ethers), covered by the loop. Length of loop with coordinates x
= 0,  y = v,  0 ££  v ££  v1 did not change its position  and at the same time other lengths of loop, including
border length x = v1,  y = v,  0  ££  v  ££  v1  were moving. Influence of constant magnetic field exactly on
this expanding and compressing ambience, covered by the loop, and brings to arising of electrical field
in each point of surface, covering by the loop, and arising of current in the loop.

If we would have assigned onward moving of a loop as whole in space given by equation

x = u +w t          0 ££  u ££  u1
y = v                  0 ££  v ££  v1
then magnetic field did not create on surfaces covering by the loop no electrical field and consequently
current in the loop. This fact is confirmed on experiment [1], [3]. So, our generalization of differential
Maxwell  equations  on  the  case  of  expansion  or  compression  of  ethers  -  a  carrier  of  electromagnetic
field will allow to get additional information on characteristics of this field and its carrier - an ether.

In conclusion it’s possible to notice the following: the velocity of moving of ambience  V  is
not connected with the velocity of spreading of electromagnetic field with in vacuum. If ambience is a
carrier  of  electromagnetic  field  is  move,  the  question  of  invariance  of  received  equations  will  be  a
subject of the following article. There we will show that vector  N  normal  to  the  moving  surface  can
changed with velocity greater then velocity of light.
Ideas of present work are published earlier in [4].

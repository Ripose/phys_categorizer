Abstract. Sound transmission through water-air interface is normally weak because of a 

strong mass density contrast. Here we show that the transparency of the interface 

increases dramatically at low frequencies. Rather counterintuitively, almost all acoustic 

energy emitted by a sufficiently shallow monopole source under water is predicted to be 

radiated into atmosphere. Physically, increased transparency at lower frequencies is due 

to the increasing role of inhomogeneous waves and a destructive interference of direct 

and surface-reflected waves under water. The phenomenon of anomalous transparency 

has significant implications for acoustic communication across the water-air interface, 

generation of ambient noise, and detection of underwater explosions.  

 

 

 

 

Because of the stark mass density contrast between air and water, water-air 

interface is normally considered as a perfectly reflecting, pressure-release boundary in 

1

underwater acoustics or a rigid boundary in atmospheric acoustics [1].  Ray-theoretical 

calculations predict weak coupling between sound fields in air and water, with an energy 

transmission coefficient on the order of the ratio of acoustic impedances of air and water 

[2, 3]. However, at infrasonic frequencies, underwater sources are typically located 

within a fraction of the wavelength from the interface, and ray calculations cease to be 

applicable. Here we show that the water-air interface is anomalously transparent for 

sound radiated by shallow sources, and almost all the energy emitted under water can be 

radiated into the air. For a monopole source at a depth which is small compared to 

acoustic wavelength, the ratio of energy radiated into the air to the total emitted energy is 

larger by a factor up to 3,400 under normal conditions than it is for the same source 

located a wavelength or more from the interface. We also show that the increase in 

transparency of the interface and the absolute value of the acoustic power radiated into 

the air are sensitive to the type of the underwater acoustic source. 

 

Instead of being an almost perfect mirror, as previously believed, water-air 

interface can be a good conduit of low-frequency underwater sound into the atmosphere. 

The anomalous transparency of the water-air interface may have significant implications 

in problems that range from generation of low-frequency ambient noise in the air by 

bubbles collapsing under water and heating of the upper atmosphere due to absorption of 

infrasound to understanding the role of hearing in avian predation of aquatic animals and 

acoustic monitoring and detection of powerful underwater explosions for the purposes of 

the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

Previous theoretical [4-13] and experimental [3, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14-17] studies of 

sound transmission through the air-water interface concentrated on acoustic fields under 

water due to airborne sources, primarily because of the existence of powerful noise 

sources in the atmosphere (such as helicopters [16], propeller-driven aircraft [10, 13, 15], 

and supersonic transport with their attending sonic booms [9, 11, 12, 17]) and possible 

effects of these man-made sources on marine life [9, 16].  

 

We apply a theory of acoustic fields in layered media [3, 18] to develop a full-

wave description of sound transmission from water to air. Penetration of sound through 

the interface will be characterized by acoustic transparency, defined as the ratio of 

acoustic power radiated into air to the total acoustic power emitted by an underwater 

continuous wave source. Introduce Cartesian coordinate system r = (x, y, 0) with a 

vertical coordinate z increasing downward (Fig. 1A). Plane z = 0 separates homogeneous 

half-spaces z > 0 (water) and z < 0 (air), where sound speeds and mass densities are c1, ρ1 

and c2  = c1/n, ρ2 = m ρ1, respectively. Representative values of the refraction index n and 

mass density ratio are

 It is the smallness of m and n - 2 compared to 

unity that is responsible for peculiarities of sound transmission through the water/air 

Let a point source be situated at a point (0, 0, z0), z0 > 0 in water. Acoustic 

pressure p1 due to the source in the absence of an interface, wave p2 reflected from the 

interface into water, and wave p3 refracted into air are given by integrals over plane

The power 

output of sound sources (Fig. 1B) is very close to that in the case of a pressure-release 

boundary, where V = -1, with a possible exception for source depths z0, which are small 

compared to the acoustic wavelength in water. For sources with anti-symmetric plane-

z →

large z

0, because of the constructive interference of incident (p1) and reflected (p2) waves 

(Fig. 1B). For sources with symmetrical spectra (S1 = S2) near the pressure-release 

boundary, the power output vanishes at 

0

 because of the destructive interference of

incident and reflected waves. When

m< (cid:19)  Jt remains finite for all source depths and

has a deep minimum (Figs. 1C and 1D).

.

 The angular density is shown in Figs. 2A-C. 

For shallow sources, the bulk of the radiation occurs at refraction angles 

.
θ δ>

Radiation in such directions rapidly decreases with the depth increase, because of a 

decrease in amplitude of incident evanescent waves at the interface z = 0, as described by 

the exponential factor in eq. (5). Ray theory accounts only for radiation in the 

directions 2θ δ≤ . This radiation is due to incident homogeneous plane waves and is 

independent of the source depth.  

 

The relative contribution of inhomogeneous waves to sound transmission through 

the interface is also sensitive to refraction index and source type (Figs. 3A - C) but is 

insensitive to the density ratio m as long as the latter is small. Inhomogeneous waves play 

a dominant role when acoustic frequency is low and refraction index is large. According 

to eqs. (4) and (5), for the water-air interface, the contribution of inhomogeneous waves 

exceeds that of homogeneous waves by the factors

 for very shallow monopole and dipole sources, respectively. As 

long as the contribution of homogeneous waves is independent of source depth and 

frequency, these factors also determine the increase in the absolute value of the acoustic 

power transmitted into air when a source depth and/or frequency decrease, so that that the 

nondimensional source depth 

1 0k z

changes from 

k z (cid:21)
1 0

1

to 

k z (cid:19)
1 0

1

. The role of 

inhomogeneous waves and, consequently, the increase in sound transmission into air are 

even greater for higher-order multipole sources due to the greater weight of plane waves 

with 1 < q < n in their spectra.  

 

Because of the contribution of inhomogeneous waves, the acoustic transparency 

Ja/Jt of the water-air interface rapidly grows with diminishing source depth, when 

k z <
1 0 1,

 from its ray-theoretical value O(m/n) at 

k z (cid:21)
1 0

1

(Figs. 4A and 4B). For sound 

sources with symmetrical spectra (S

1 = S2), the transparency closely approaches unity: Jw 

= Ja O(m) at 

z →
0

0

, i.e., almost all emitted energy is radiated into the air (Fig. 4C). 

Although counterintuitive, this phenomenon is easy to understand. Indeed, when such a 

source is on the interface, acoustic pressure in both air (p

3) and water (p1 + p2) is 

proportional to the small parameter m (see eqs. (1) – (4)). Then, because of the different 

mass densities of the two media, the acoustic power flux in air is J0 O(m), while the 

acoustic power flux in water is J0 O(m2).   

In summary, contrary to the conventional wisdom based on ray-theoretical 

predictions and observations at higher frequencies, infrasonic energy from localized 

waterborne sources can be effectively transmitted into air. We have demonstrated 

 

 

7

theoretically that water-air interface is anomalously transparent to low-frequency acoustic 

waves. The phenomenon of anomalous transparency occurs when a sound source is 

located at a shallow depth, meaning that the depth is a fraction of acoustic wavelength. 

For shallow sources, acoustic intensity in the air increases dramatically due to energy 

transfer from the source by evanescent waves under water. Almost all emitted acoustic 

energy is channeled into the air when sound is generated by a shallow monopole source 

or any other localized source with a radiation pattern symmetric with respect to the 

horizontal plane. For such sources, an increased power flux into the air due to evanescent 

waves is accompanied by a decrease in downward acoustic power flux due to the 

destructive interference of direct and surface-reflected waves under water.

interface. Using an explicit expression, eq. (4), for the Fresnel reflection coefficient, for 

the acoustic power flux into the air and the total emitted power flux we obtain:

Equations (A11) – (A13) are exact and apply when m < 1 and n ≥ 1. 

Power output of a point monopole source (such as a source of volume velocity, 

see [A2, Sec. 4.1]), according to eq. (A1), depends on the reflective properties of and 

distance to the interface. In the limit 

m →

t deviates from unity because of the interference of 

fields of the actual source and the image source at (0, 0, - z0). When a monopole source 

approaches a pressure-release boundary and the volume velocity produced by the source 

is kept constant, the energy output vanishes because fields due to the actual source and its 

image interfere destructively. Unlike this ideal case, the destructive interference is never 

complete for the water-air interface. According to eqs. (A3), (A6), and (A7), the energy 

output of a shallow source equals

(see Fig. 1D). The minimum value of Jt is about 0.01 of the power output of the same 

source when located far away from the interface. 

Of the two contributions in eq. (A2) to the acoustic energy transmitted through the 

interface, the first one, which is proportional to A1 and is due to homogeneous plane 

waves, coincides with the result that would be obtained in the ray theory. In the wave 

theory, there is an additional contribution due to inhomogeneous waves. Its significance 

depends on the source depth and the refraction index (Fig. 3A) and is insensitive to the 

mass density ratio as long as the latter is small. The contribution of homogeneous waves 

is depth-independent, while the contribution of inhomogeneous waves, quite naturally, 

decreases with increasing source depth. Note that, according to the analytical results 

presented above, A2 increases with n at small k1z0 and decreases with n at large k1z0. With 

relatively large values of n characteristic of the water-air interface, the contribution of 

inhomogeneous waves exceeds the contribution of homogeneous waves by the factor

As the source depth increases, the share of the energy radiated into the air 

monotonically and rapidly decreases because of the decreasing role of inhomogeneous 

waves and, for depths greater than 

 defined in eq. (A15), also because of an increase 

)min

(

in the total energy output. At 

k z >
1 0

1

, J

a is close to the value predicted within the ray 

theory; the remaining depth dependence of the ratio Ja / Jt in Fig. 4B is mostly due to 

depth dependence of Jt. At 

k z <
1 0

0.21

, at least 10% of the radiated energy is transmitted 

into the air. For orientation, at f = 1 Hz, this source depth range approximately 

corresponds to z

0 < 50 m. 

 

Details of calculations for other point sources are similar and will not be 

presented here. As far as a wave theory of sound transmission through an interface is 

concerned, the main qualitative distinction of dipole and higher multipole sources from 

the monopole source lies in a greater weight of inhomogeneous waves in plane-wave 

spectra of multipoles. For underwater sources, it results in an even stronger increase in 

the acoustic power Ja transmitted by a shallow multipole into the air, as compared to the 

power transmitted from the same source when it is located at a depth of a few 

wavelengths. In particular, for the horizontal dipole (where

Acoustic transparency of a rough interface 

 

The wavelength of low-frequency acoustic waves, such as infrasound, in air and, 

perforce, in water, is much greater than height of waves on the ocean surface. Therefore, 

the effect of surface roughness on the transmission of infrasound is generally expected to 

be small. However, with the acoustic power flux through the plane water-air interface 

being proportional to the small mass density ratio m, even small (compared to J0) 

corrections due to roughness may be significant unless the power flux in the scattered 

waves is also proportional to the small parameter m. 

We now consider the water-air interface as a time-independent and stationary (in 

the statistical sense) random surface. Random surface elevations η(r) have zero mean, 

variance σ2, and power spectrum F(q). In terms of the spectrum

spherical wave decomposition into plane waves, eqs. (1) and (2) with S1 = S2 = 1, with 

subsequent integration of the scattered field, eq. (A21), caused by each incident plane 

wave over q0. The coherent component of the scattered field in water is given by eqs. (1)

We see that both Jsc and Jav have non-zero limits when 

m →

0.

 However, the 

leading terms of expansions of J

sc and Jav in powers of the small parameters of the 

problem cancel each other, according to eqs. (A25) and (A27). That is, within the 

approximation we consider, the total correction due to roughness to the acoustic power 

flux into the air equals zero.  

Within the terms of the second order in k1σ, expansion of Jsc + Jav with respect to 

the small parameter m starts from terms m ln m or smaller, and correction due to 

roughness is small compared to the acoustic power flux through a plane water-air 

interface as long as the condition eq. (A17) is met. The above analysis does not allow us 

to evaluate terms of higher order than k1

2σ2 in the expansion of Jsc + Jav. Still, these 

higher-order terms are expected to vanish in the limit 

m →

0

 since J

sc + Jav = 0 to any 

order in k1σ in the case of a rigid boundary, i.e., at m = 0. 

 

Aside from its effect on energy flux into the air, surface roughness affects 

distribution of the acoustic energy between the water and the air by changing the source 

output. From the general expression for source output obtained in [A2, Sec. 8.7], it 

follows that perturbation in the energy output of a point monochromatic source of volume 

velocity is bilinear in source strength and in the acoustic pressure of the scattered wave at 

the point where the source is located. (We assume that the source strength, i.e., amplitude

and phase of the monochromatic oscillations of volume velocity the source creates, is 

kept constant. In other words, we assume that the source radiates the same spherical wave 

p0 whether or not the ocean surface is rough.) Hence, roughness-induced change in the 

statistical average of the source output depends only on the average scattered field. 

Consequently, in the case of a rough surface, the total energy output Jt can still be 

calculated with eq. (A1) provided the Fresnel reflection coefficient V is replaced by the 

mean reflection coefficient 

,V  eq. (A18).

Being proportional to σ2, the roughness-induced correction to the source output is always 

small compared to J0. Hence, the correction can be significant only where

When the latter inequality holds, following [A2, Sec. 3.6], in estimating integrals on the

 We see that corrections due to roughness to the source 

output and transparency of the interface are negligible as long as condition (A17) is met.

superposition of such inhomogeneous plane waves with opposite signs of the vertical 

component of the wave vector results in a nonzero power flux in the vertical direction, 

provided there is a phase shift between the two waves. In the water, inhomogeneous 

waves carry energy from the source to the air-water interface as a result of interference of 

incident and reflected inhomogeneous waves.

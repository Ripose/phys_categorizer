ABSTRACT 

 
Appearance  of  physical  properties  of  objects  is  a  basis  for  their  detection  in  a  media.  Fugacity  is  a 
physical  property  of  objects.  Definition  of  estimations  fugacity  for  different  objects  can  be  executed  on 
model which principle of construction is considered in this paper. The model developed by us well-formed 
with classical definition fugacity and open up possibilities for calculation of physical parameter «fugacity» 
for elementary and compound substances. 

Keywords: fugacity, phase changes, thermodynamic model, stability, entropy. 
 

1. INTRODUCTION 

 
The reality of world around is constructed of a plenty of the objects possessing physical properties. Du-
ration of objects existence – their life time, is defined by individual physical and chemical parameters, and 
also states of a medium. In the most general case any object, under certain states, can be in one of three ag-
gregative states - solid, liquid or gaseous. Conversion of object substance from one state in another refers to 
as phase change. Evaporation and sublimation of substance are examples of phase changes. 

Studying of aggregative states of substance can be carried out from a position of physics or on the basis 
of mathematical models. The physics of the condensed mediums has many practical problems which deci-
sion helps to study complex processes of formation and destruction of medium objects. Natural process of 
object destruction can be characterized in parameter volatility – fugacity. For the first time fugacity as the 
settlement  size  used  for  an  estimation  of  real  gas  properties,  by  means  of  the  thermodynamic  parities  de-
duced for ideal gases, was offered by Lewis in 1901. 

Expanding these representations it is possible to specify, that all objects of a medium are material, so, 
for them there is a physical description. Following the general representations about fugacity as settlement 
physical parameter of the substance forming the condensed phase or entering into its structure, it is accepted 
to believe, that value of this parameter as much as possible in sated to prime steam of this phase. Such con-
cept allows approving, that fugacity is the physical parameter of substance describing ability of substance of 
concrete object to conversion in a gaseous state, at constant parameters of medium. The most important pa-
rameters of medium are pressure and temperature. Generally fugacity it is possible to identify with a physical 
parameter of material of the research object, describing ability of substance to an output from the condensed 
phase as which the solid or a liquid is considered. It is possible to note, that in the physical understanding, 
the given term well corresponds to true. The Latin name of physical process of substance weight loss, en-
tered Lewis, corresponds: “fugitivus” - escaped, departed, well explains an essence of the phenomenon. It’s 
just as process of substance transformation in to the many particles state. We shall designate this process by 
the term «fugacity» and to denote of symbol «F». 

Natural character of process fugacity as physical process is caused by thermodynamic axioms. So con-
sidering any object as thermodynamic system, it is possible to tell, that entropy systems (S) are characterized 
with  quantity  of  possible  microstates  adjusted  with  their  thermodynamic  properties.  (Ludwig  Boltzmann. 
1877).

where a constant k=1.38·10–23 J/К, and Ω is number of microstates which are possible in an available 
macroscopic  state.  This  postulate,  describes  thermodynamic  systems,  using  statistical  representation  about 
behavior of components making them. Besides, the postulate approves about presence of indissoluble com-
munication between microscopic properties of object with one of thermodynamic properties. On this basis 
the conclusion is done that entropy is function of a state and characterizes a measure of the structural disor-
der. 

Basis of such representation about investigated object makes entropy of transition. Assuming as a basis 
classical model of gases where the structural order is destroyed, it is possible to consider a state of thermo-
dynamic system on boundary of phases: solid – gaseous or a liquid – gaseous as a state at extreme to a heat.

It is obvious, that to process in which the border of phase change is considered, entropy corresponds to value 
of boiling-point, defined individually for each substance. Statistical definition entropy is a basis for the for-
mulation of the thermodynamic second law, which consequence is the statement that the thermodynamic sys-
tem aspires to pass spontaneously in a state with the maximal thermodynamic probability. 

The condensed mediums are widespread in the Nature. Typical examples of the condensed are liquids, 
crystals, amorphous substances and gaseous. The condensed medium – as object of research, can be repre-
sented by model which allows study some property of natural object. Within the limits of model (Fig. 1) it is 
possible to consider a solid state of object which can be connected with other aggregative states.

ticles of object weight in surrounding space. For a liquids is an evaporation and for solids – sublimation. 

 

2. THERMODYNAMIC SYSTEM MODEL “SUBJECT – MEDIUM" 

 
From  the  position  of  molecular  physics  studying  physical  properties and  aggregative  states  of  various 
objects in view of their molecular structure is of interest. In theoretical researches of molecular physics two 
approaches are used. First of them is realized within the limits of statistical, and the second thermodynamic 
physics. For the statistical approach use of mathematical probability theory in studying macroscopic proper-
ties of objects is characteristic. The basis of the thermodynamic approach is made with the analysis of quan-
titative parities of the major parameters of object state. 

The thermodynamic method, unlike a statistical method, is not connected with any concrete representa-
tions  about  an  internal  structure  of  objects  and  elements.  The  thermodynamics  operates  with  macroscopic 
characteristics of studied objects. Assuming as a basis a little bit empirically established positions - laws of 
thermodynamics which possess rather big generality, we shall generate calculation fugacity principles. Rep-
resentation about thermodynamic system is created on the basis of the general representations about the mac-
roscopic elements considered in the form of uniform system. At studying evolution of thermodynamic sys-
tem the big attention is given questions of a power exchange between elements of system and a medium. A 
typical example of thermodynamic system – is a liquid and adjoining it of pairs. 

Let's  define  thermodynamic  system  (

iA )  as  a  unique  composition  of  the  macroscopic  elements,  ex-
changing energy among themselves and a medium (W ). We shall consider model (Fig. 2) thermodynamic 
iA , which can be in different aggregative states ( 1e ,  2e ). We believe, that the system is characterized 
system 
by  a  set  of  macroscopic  elements,  which exchange  energy  both  inside  of  system,  and  with  an  medium,  in 
which essential parameters are presented by pressure and temperature ( P ,  T ). During supervision over suc-
cession of events in the medium there is an opportunity to find out a particle of weight ( mD
iA  
which are any way injected in surrounding space. 

), belonging 

Considering  the  power  characteristic  of  system,  we  shall  specify  on  two  components:  a  parameter  of 
power communication between elements of system and a power parameter of external processes. Despite of 
presence of the certain analogy in definition of the specified parameters here it is easy to find out essential 
distinctions.  In  the  first  case  the  generalized  parameter  of  power  communication  which  characterizes  of  a 
system phase state is allocated. In the second case the power parameter of system conversion process from a 
solid or liquid aggregative state in steam – a gaseous aggregative state is considered.

In the most general case it is possible to tell, that the state of thermodynamic system is defined by set of 
values  of  thermodynamic  parameters:  density,  polarization,  magnetization,  boiling,  freezing  and  melting 
points. We shall enter a designation: boiling point as  BPT , melting point as  MPT  and freezing point as  FPT . It 
is possible to expand the list of these parameters. It is obvious, that the majority of the specified parameters 
are characterized with macroscopic properties of system. From here follows that two states of system admit 
different if for them numerical values even one of thermodynamic parameters are various.  

If the system state does not change in time then it is permanently. The stationary state of system refers to 
equilibrium if its invariance in time is not caused by action of any, external process. We believe that thermo-
dynamic parameters of system are interconnected. Therefore the equilibrium state of system can be defined 
unequivocally, by means of the task of values of the limited number of these parameters. In thermodynamics 
distinguish external and internal parameters of a system state. External parameters of a state the parameters 
depending only from generalized coordinates of external bodies or factors with which the system cooperates 
refer to. We shall allocate parameter of external temperature – ambient temperature  ATT . Internal parameters 
of system we shall set values of boiling and melting points. The specified parameters allow identifying vari-
ous objects of a medium generally. 

 
 

3. THE NECESSARY STATES OF BEING THERMODYNAMIC SYSTEM MODEL 

“SUBJECT – MEDIUM" 

 
At studying physical properties of object (substance) the big attention is given definition of parameters 
of a state. In particular, allocate the parameters describing change of aggregative states: gaseous, liquid or 
solid. As is known, if to choose system of coordinates: pressure ( P ) – temperature (T ) it is possible to dis-
play curves of balance between various phases of the given substance. The illustrative image of the phase 
plot is shown on (Fig. 3). 
The trajectory 

TPOT  corresponds to balance between a solid and gaseous phase, trajectory 

 corre-

BTTP

sponds to balance between a liquid and the steam, and trajectory  MTTP
 corresponds to balance between a 
solid and liquid phase. Such representation about behavior of thermodynamic system appears useful to draw 
a conclusion on existence of two important state parameters: melting point ( MPT ) and boiling point ( BPT ). 

Really given parameters define a power state of thermodynamic system which can be considered as the 
identifier of object. In this case for each object (substance), at constant pressure ( P ), it is possible to specify 
pair values ( MPT , BPT ) for which there is a unique object (substance). 

It is possible to allocate the basic fragments. Line

curve of evaporation. Line  MTTP

other ambient temperature such procedure will be considered in addition. This explanatory is necessary be-
cause there are distinctions in definition of standard states of solid and liquid, on the one hand, and gaseous, 
on the other hand. The standard state for a gaseous element or connection is defined not how for solid sub-
stance or a liquid. For a standard state of ideal gaseous this satisfies to parity:

Let's consider phase changes. The crystal substance is characterized by the certain natural arrangement 
of particles making it. For a liquid and gaseous infringement of the order of an arrangement of elements of 
P 1=

structure is characteristic. In standard condition, at 
physical object loses a part of the weight. This is demonstration of fugacity process. At the established ambi-
ent temperature and furthermore at consecutive heating solid substance energy of oscillatory movement of its 
particles all time increases therefore their mutual pushing apart amplifies also. Some particles of substance 
have an opportunity to break forces of an attraction and pass in surrounding space. This is phenomenon fu-
gacity “a solid – a medium”.

For each substance which is being a solid phase, there is a certain melting point  MPT  at which the attrac-
tion of particles to each other weakens. The substance is melted also passes in a liquid state. In a liquid the 
mutual attraction of molecules still is enough to keep them together, and only separate, is the fastest at pre-
sent to moving molecules it is possible to come off a surface. This is phenomenon fugacity “a liquid – a me-
dium”. 

At the further heating a liquid the number of fast molecules increases. Pressure pair the given substance 
above a surface of a liquid gradually increases. For each liquid there is an individual value of temperature of 
boiling  BPT  at which pressure the pair becomes equal to external pressure. The liquid begins to boil. Above 
point  BPT  exists only steam – a gaseous phase. 

Allocating the phase change describing formation of gaseous fraction of investigated object, that postu-
lates change of the condensed phase which is reflected in loss of some part of weight of object – to emission 
of particles. Following these representations it is easy to understand physical sense of a parameter летучести 
– fugacity. From this point of view fugacity is a parameter describing ability of substance, at the established 
values of pressure and temperatures of an medium, to lose a part of the weight. The parameter fugacity can 
be considered as an estimation describing ability of substance to inject a part of the weight in surrounding 
space. The disintegration of the condensed phase identified with one three phase states, occurs according to 
the law of increase entropy. 

Transition in a new state of system is accompanied by change of internal energy. Internal energy of sys-
tem (object) U - is defined as full energy minus kinetic energy of object, as the whole, and, potential energy 
of object in an external floor of forces. Hence, internal energy develops of kinetic energy of chaotic move-
ment of molecules, potential energy of interaction between them and intramolecular energy. 

Internal  energy  U  is  unequivocal  function  of  a  state  of  system  which  is  characterized  enthalpy H .  It 
means that every time when the system appears in the given state, internal energy accepts value inherent in 
thus state, irrespective of background of system. Hence, change of internal energy at transition from one state 
in another will be always equal to a difference of values these states, irrespective of a way on which transi-
tion was made. Then the power state of system can be set concrete value:

On this basis it will be fair to specify an opportunity of synthesis of new objects which can be spent with 

use of the different technologies providing reception of identical objects on properties. 

Considering, that it is impossible to measure internal energy of object directly, and it is possible to de-

fine only change of internal energy  UD

 we shall write down: 

 
where: Q – internal energy bodies (heat) [J], W – work which should be made for translation of system

in an medium [J]. 

It is possible to note, that destruction of system as working process, is identical to work on translation of 
elements  of  system  in  a  medium.  Fugacity  –  the  physical  parameter  of  thermodynamic  system  describing 
work which is made above system at transition from a solid or liquid state in a gaseous state, at constant ex-
ternal pressure. Such work made above system on translation from one aggregative state in another, is char-
acterized by the energy identified with a physical parameter fugacity. Considering, that values of tempera-
tures of phase changes for each substance are individual, the value of estimation received as a result of calcu-
lation fugacity also individually. 

Formally, such conclusion can be received on the basis of calculation of change entropy thermodynamic

5. CONSTRUCTION OF FUGACITY’S PROCESS MODEL 

 
Designing initial model of process, the postulate was established: action of the external factor – tempera-
tures of medium, changes a state of object. Consequence of such statement is that at rise in ambient tempera-
ture, the object which is being the medium, changes by means of loss of weight. This phenomenon is certain 
as fugacity. At achievement of some critical temperature, characteristic only for the given object, there is a 
transition in a new aggregative state. 

The formalism of model is well illustrated by expression (10). Here the effect of gradual destruction of 
investigated object, to be exact speaking its structural properties is distinctly observed. Believing, that such 
destruction is connected with gradual transition in a new aggregative state, distinctly we establish presence 
of smooth transition. It is possible to note, that action of the external factor – temperatures of medium, it is 
interfaced to the work directed on infringement макро of communications of elements of structure of object. 
Allocating this aspect it is possible to note, that accentuation of attention on the temperature factor of a me-
dium does not settle all variety of possible revolting factors of medium. In the most general case here can be 
considered and other factors. However within the limits of the established model the temperature factor of 
medium which defines process fugacity is considered only. Influence of ambient temperature on process fu-
gacity  is  considered  at  constant  pressure  which  is  accepted  equal  to  atmospheric  pressure.  Introduction  of 
such  state  allows  receiving  a  set  of  comparable  estimations  fugacity,  that  creates  a  basis  for  construction 
phenomenological of some objects as which chemical elements can be considered, inert gaseous and various 
substances on a chemical compound, being in the certain aggregative states. 

Following these representations, we shall consider the basic arguments creating a basis of designing of 
model of process fugacity, and also estimations of display of this process providing calculation in the certain 
states of a medium. We shall allocate the main arguments and we shall list them in such sequence. 
1.  Really in an expert it is easy to find out a plenty of substances with equal molecular weights, but differ-
ent stereochemical structure. For such substances it is easy to find out distinctions in values of tempera-
tures of fusion and boiling. Distinction of values of these parameters convincingly testifies to a different 
stereochemical structure of substances, despite of presence of the general chemical formula of their rep-
resentation. If to use concept of a sign, as some identification symbol reflecting structural properties of

substance values of temperatures of fusion and boiling can be a basis for construction of an image of 
substance (object). 

2.  Following  the  general  physical  representations  it  is  possible  to  tell;  that  at  absolute  zero  should  the 
"rigid" structure of substance is observed. As opposed to it on a scale of temperatures it is possible to 
find such temperature point at which any substance exists in the form of plasma. It means, that fugacity 
as some function of model, is realized on the limited range of definition where limiting values of physi-
cal process fugacity can be established. Taking it into consideration it is possible to tell, that an image of 
substance as the formal model, has the limited area of representation. Then it is necessary to recognize 
presence of the bottom and top border of existence of an image that will well be coordinated with initial 
representations of physics. In such understanding the estimation fugacity can be formed on the basis of 
property of stability (stability) of substance – abilities to not collapse in the certain range of values of 
temperatures of a medium. A priori the top values of ambient temperature are not limited. Hence, it is 
possible  to  postulate  equality  of  estimations  fugacity  for  all  substances,  at  great  values  of  a  parame-
ter ATT . 

3.  Really, the parameter of stability is connected with entropyей phase changes of substance under the se-
lected  external  states.  If  as  states  of  existence  of  object  to  consider  only  temperature  of  medium  and 
pressure that will well be coordinated with the physical and chemical laws describing realization of dif-
ferent processes it is possible one of parameters to accept for a constant. We shall put as a constant pres-
sure is accepted. Then stability – stability of substance destruction (change of an aggregative state), is 
characterized by values of temperatures of fusion and boiling. Within the limits of considered model it 
also  will  well  be  coordinated  with  initial  representation  about  development  of  numerous  processes  of 
transition of substance from one aggregative state in another. 
 
Believing,  as  before,  that  values  of  parameters 

  are  unique  parameters  for  each  sub-

Thus,  we  receive,  that  estimation  entropy,  calculated  on  an  interval  of  temperatures in  which the  pair

values

sion will well be coordinated with the general physical representations about uniqueness of spatial structure 
of substance and presence of communication with power parameters of system. On the other hand, commu-
nication  of  power  parameters  of  system  with  the  work  made  at  transition  of  system  from  one  aggregative

enough and convincingly testifies to an opportunity of calculation of estimations fugacity for different sub-
stances on the basis of typical physical parameters of a state of objects of a medium.

Let's address to consideration of the information model which are clearing up main principles of calcula-

tion of an estimation fugacity. 
Choosing some object

, with the purpose of an establishment of an estimation fugacity, as the ap-
rioristic information on object its physical parameters are used. Formally such parameters can be considered 
in the form of a sign design of the statement constructed in terms of physical parameters, for example, of 
temperature  and  weight.  Believing,  that  the  selected  parameters  allow  receiving  knowledge  of  individual 
property of object, it is required to establish the form of a sign design which provided carrying out of de-
manded calculations. In our case it is possible to consider two ways of reception of a required estimation fu-
gacity. In one case that corresponds to the first way, the stationary medium, with the established typical pa-
rameters is considered.  

The estimation fugacity pays off under constant states of medium for the selected substance possessing 
unique  physical  values  of  typical  parameters  of  a  state.  In  other  case  that  corresponds  to  the  second  way, 
process of calculation of an estimation fugacity is realized similarly, but at change of ambient temperature. 
The choice of change of values of a temperature range of a medium is spent in view of properties of real ob-
jects. Not breaking the general line of reasoning, we can note, that expected downturn of values of a required 
estimation  St  at increase in temperature of medium, should have the given reason limit. For this reason, de-
spite of the big range of possible temperature values ATT , for concrete substance, has no physical sense to 
consider values  St  at 
 substance of object passes in gaseous – plasma. These 
recommendations will allow reducing volume of settlement estimations if it does not contradict interests of 
research of the selected object. Strengthening this representation it is possible to tell, that at great values of 
temperature  of  medium  all  the  substances  placed  on  this  medium,  will  have  practically  identical  fugacity. 
These representations can be reflected in the form of information model (Fig. 6).

Obviously, with rise in temperature of medium intensity of process of destruction of investigated object 
increases, and, hence, increases fugacity. Within the limits of model, loss of substance of object, at change of 
temperature of medium, it is possible to consider on an interval of temperatures [

7. ELEMENT’S FUGACITY VALUATION 

 
Research of physical properties of various objects has a good theoretical basis. So, for example, at re-
search of properties of materials диэлектриков as substances with various physical parameters, the method 
of calculation of dielectric losses is widely applied. The given method of calculation of an estimation of di-
electric losses possesses the certain analogy to calculation fugacity. The estimation of dielectric losses, with 
reference to various materials – to substances, in wide understanding of this term, is created on illustrative 
model in configuration space. We shall enter into consideration configuration space with system of coordi-
nates: «Temperature» and «weight». Each object, for which the estimation fugacity is calculated, can be pre-

. Model of succession of 
sented in the selected system of coordinates by three parameters: 
events in system: the object – an medium is formed on the basis of changes of temperature of medium. We 
shall lead positioning some object, having established values of physical parameters on corresponding axes 
of coordinates (Fig. 7-a). We shall lead graphic constructions (Fig. 7-b). We shall note a triangle  OMT
 
and an angle

On the basis of the considered model of fugacity definition as the settlement physical parameter describ-

ing ability of substance to collapse at different values of ambient temperature, we shall note: 

1.  Fugacity  –  property  of  all  material  objects  possessing  an  opportunity  of  existence  in  two  aggregative 

2.  Objects – substances for which the parameter fugacity pays off, possess a unique stereochemical design 

states; 

of association of chemical elements; 

3.  Objects – material objects are characterized by value of molecular weight and for them thermodynamic 

values of temperature of phase changes are known. 
 
To interested of define estimation fugacity chemical elements of periodic system. With this purpose cal-
culation of an estimation of stability we shall lead on expression (12), and an estimation fugacity on expres-
sion (14). 

Let's address to chemical elements of periodic system. We shall display chemical elements according to

Arsenic on property of stability is allocated in this group. In a free state elements of a subgroup of arse-
nic have a metal appearance, well spend heat and electricity. In the nature these elements meet in the form of 
sulfide minerals. Impurities of all three elements often meet in ores of various metals. Arsenic is capable to 
exist  in  several  allotropic  forms,  from  which  steadiest  "grey"  form.  At  fast  cooling  of  arsenic  vapors  the 
«yellow arsenic» As4 turns out. The stereochemical molecular structure of «yellow arsenic» has structure of a 
correct tetrahedron. On air such chemical compound easily is oxidized, as is reflected in property of stability.

The  received  estimations  testify  that  with  growth  of  external  temperature,  stability  of  an  element  de-
creases. It is marked and in practice of researches of substance. Change of structure for this substance can 
occur  and  in  usual  states,  for  example,  under  action  of  light.  Under  action  of  light  the  «yellow  arsenic» 
passes  in  to  the  «grey  arsenic»,  widely  widespread  in  the  nature.  At  sublimation  As  in  hydrogen  stream

The received estimations we shall present in the illustrative form on Fig. 10. We shall note that the first 
place borrows hydrogen, and last place belongs to radon. We shall execute similar calculations for definition 
of estimation fugacity rare gases. We shall illustrate results on Fig. 10. In a number of inert gaseous special 
positions  borrow  helium.  Among  inert  gaseous,  helium  can  be  observed  in  a  solid  state,  but  at  pressure 
. This feature of helium is shown in the calculated estimation fugacity. In calculation fuga-
nearly
city for helium at different values of ambient temperature, this gaseous is on the second place after hydrogen.

With rise in ambient temperature fugacity helium grows more intensively, than at other gases. Exception 
is hydrogen, for which estimation fugacity always above, than at helium. In the general portrait of distribu-
tion of estimations fugacity consideration of a trend is of interest at low temperature.

At the selected temperature (

) for other inert gaseous the level of an estimation fugacity 
goes down, but is insignificant. So, for radon downturn of temperature changes an estimation fugacity which 
remains  practically  constant  a  little.  On  the  contrary,  for  this  gas  rise  in  ambient  temperature  essentially 
raises a level of an estimation fugacity (Fig. 11).

Having  received  the  general  representations  about  distribution  of  estimations  fugacity  in  a  number  of 
chemical elements, we shall consider the ordered number of estimations fugacity. On the one hand construc-
tion such of some will clear a position of a chemical element in a number fugacity, and on the other hand, 
will  allow establishing  the  elements  possessing  a  high  parameter fugacity.  Thus  it  is  possible  to  note, that 
construction  of  some  estimations  fugacity  opens  ample  opportunities  on  studying  mutual  communication 
with other typical properties of the chemical elements widely presented in various researches. 

Analyzing the received estimations fugacity it is possible to state a hypothesis that at change of external 
temperature change of a position of elements will be observed. However, if to consider rather small fluctua-
tions of external temperature for some chemical elements change of number of a position will be small. On 
the contrary, for the chemical elements belonging to a category of gases, change of number of a position will 
be greater. We shall any way choose a range of change of external temperature and we shall lead calculation 
of estimations fugacity for chemical elements. Results of calculation we shall present in Table 3.

The result of calculations of estimations fugacity is presented by a series of figures (Fig.12 - Fig.15). 
 
The  stated  hypothesis  about  an  opportunity  of  detection  of  some  stable  chemical  elements  possessing 
practically  constant  and  small  values  of  estimations  fugacity  on  the  selected  range  of  temperatures  has 
proved to be true. The first chemical element can be named carbon, which natural formation well-known – 
diamond. Lower estimations fugacities are established for chemical elements: Be, Li, B.

Li is present at minerals which representatives are petalite and spodumene. Typical representative Li of min-
eral origin is mica. Mica — is one of the most widespread minerals of rocks. This mineral possesses a high 
degree of stability. Chemical element B is known in the form of amorphous green - brown powder or the fine 
crystals having metal shine and on hardness almost not conceding diamond.

Let's note that values D H correspond to data of the physical directory. We shall lead comparison of two 

thermodynamic estimations in the illustrative form (Fig. 16).

where: wSt = 60*10-22 [J/mol] 
 

Analyzing  schedules,  we  establish  similarity  of  estimations  ∆H  and  St. The  received  result  allows 

noting efficiency of used physical process model.

Now questions of natural disintegration of substance, and it are formally possible so to characterize 
fugacity,  are  considered  in  different  areas  of  researches.  Using  known  physical  representations  about  this 
process,  various  models  which  research  allows  establishing  estimations  fugacity  are  created.  In  the  most 
widespread  representation  usually  use  classical  equation  D.  Mendeleyev  for  a  state  of  ideal  gaseous.  The 
positive beginning here is that the gaseous aggregative state is allocated. The gaseous fraction of a state of 
object, within the limits of numerous models, is considered as a primary basis for calculation of estimations 
fugacity.  As  at formation of  initial  model  structural features  of  construction  of  objects  are  not  considered, 
estimations  fugacity  aspire  to  present in a  dimensionless  kind, using  for this  purpose  normalized    scale  of 
values [0; 1]. From the point of view of practice such approach allows establishing roughly estimations fuga-
city for of some substances and can be considered as outline. In addition to it is possible to tell that such cal-
culations are complex enough and possess small illustrative at transition from one class of substances to an-
other. 

Considering, that fugacity – process connected with expressiveness of external factors and, first of 
all, with temperature, logically correctly to discuss a question on stability of the object possessing in certain 
parameters of a state. In that case it is possible to speak about molecular weight, density, a thermal capacity 
and a stereochemical structure of object. Identifying some object with the certain physical parameters of a 
state, there is an opportunity to investigate object - to establish its some properties on model. 

Constructing of the model that reflecting events interesting us, which can hypothetically occur to ob-
ject, is accompanied by search of analogues of real processes. From these positions the concept entered by 
the last century fugacity has set of illustrative and real examples in practice. Saved up since then, practical 
and theoretical, experience allows considering the given process from a position of thermodynamics within 
the limits of which the accent is put on initial representations about interaction of any object with a medium. 
Following these principles it is possible to establish, that time of existence – time of a life of any material 
object certainly and is defined as an internal structure (internal energy) object, and factors of medium. Allo-
cating as the significant factor – ambient temperature which naturally influences object, it is possible to cre-
ate model of stability of object. It is obvious, that stability of internal energy of object in system of interac-
tion with a medium is not possible. In that case loss of internal energy by object corresponds to disintegra-
tion. Disintegration of object is characterized by loss of weight which is injected in a medium, by means of 
work of the external forces made above object. It is obvious, that the greater work is made above object, the 
greater expressiveness of process of disintegration. 

From a position of physics of the given process it is possible to tell, that the formalism of the de-
scription is limited by two extreme concepts: temperature value of absolute zero and over high values of am-
bient temperature. It is obvious, that in the first case pertinently to speak about absence of display of the ex-
ternal factor – temperatures, and in the second, on the contrary, about the big influence on object of external 
temperature. According to it there is a formation of a scale fugacity. Allocating the second case it is possible 
to find easily set of examples of the ionized state of various substances – the plasma characterized by great 
value of temperature. The ionized state of substance is identified with a heat of medium that is why consid-
eration of process fugacity gets the generalized character practically for any object. 

The  approach  considered  in  given  work  to  formation  of  an  estimation  fugacity  various  objects  is 
based on positions of thermodynamics. Using the general representations about thermodynamic function of a 
state, the model of development of disintegration of the object possessing certain properties is formed. Bring-
ing to a focus to unique properties of object, physical parameters of a state which assume as basis models of 
succession of events in system “object – medium” are allocated. Using modeling representations about suc-
cession  of  events  in  system,  calculations  of  estimations  fugacity  for  typical  chemical  elements  and  inert 
gaseous are spent. Owing to the good level of scrutiny of this theme of researches which are not demanding 
additional  explanatory  and  references  to  a  plenty  of  practical  works,  the  received  results  of  calculation  of 
estimations fugacity allow to generate a phenomenological number for chemical elements and inert gaseous.

Localization  and  Causality  in  Relativistic
Quantum  Mechanics:  an  Analysis  Utilizing  the
Dirac-Bergmann  Theory  of  Constraints

11 August 1997

Localization problems in relativistic quantum mechanics are analyzed in the context of the

Dirac-Bergmann  theory  of  constraints.  Such  problems  include  apparent  violations  of

causality as well as dependence of localization properties on particular frames of  reference.

In  this  analysis,  canonically  conjugate  time  and  energy  operators  are  introduced  for  a

Klein-Gordon particle, and the system’s physical states  are determined through  the  Dirac-

Bergmann algorithm. In the resulting, parametrization invariant formulation, the system’s

time  has  an  intermediate status  as  a  Hermitian operator,  but  not  an  observable.  Gauge

invariant observables corresponding to  the  system’s  position  at  a  time  referenced to  the

experimenter’s  clock  are  defined,  and  their  spectral  decompositions  constructed.  This

allows the positive energy, spatially localized states  borrowed from  standard theory to  be

expanded on an event space wherein they  are found to  be  nonlocal  in  time.  Localization

problems are shown to be a  result  of  these states’ time-like  probability  distributions  and

the  Lorentz  rotation  of  spatial  axes  in  Minkowsi  space.  A  simple  extension  of  the

reduction postulate is proposed as a resolution of apparent causality violations.

I.    INTRODUCTION

It is well known  that problems exist in relativistic quantum  mechanics  concerning

the issues of spatial localization and causality.  While it has been generally accepted, since

the  paper  by  Newton  and  Wigner  [1],  that  positive  energy  states  which  are  spatially

localized at a particular time exist, it has been shown by Fleming [2], Hegerfeldt [3-5],  and

1

(1.2)

(1.3)

    (1.4)

others [6-11] that such states do not remain localized under time evolution; an effect which

has been dubbed  [8]  the  “Hegerfeldt  Paradox.”    The  simplest  demonstration  [3]  of  this

effect is with the relativistic Klein Gordon particle having free positive energy Hamiltonian
H = c m 2c 2 + p 2 1 21 2
  

(1.1)

,

where 

 p  is the spatial momentum, c the speed of light, and m the rest mass.   If we take a

strictly localized state 

 f

 and subject it to a translation along the vector  r  under
p (cid:215) r ,

   

U r = exp – i
h

there exists some minimum  r  such that 

 U r

 f

 is  orthogonal  to 

.    But  if  we  now

 f

allow 

 f

 to evolve under the evolution operator

for any time t, and take the scalar product of

transforms [12,13], the function 

where 

  .    According  to  a  theorem  on  the  analycity  of  Fourier

  
f r, t

 cannot vanish because its Fourier transform is not

an entire function; due to  the  exponential  in 

,  it  has  singularities  (branch

m 2c 2 + p 2 1 21 2
  

points)  on  the  complex  hyperplane  at  the  roots  of 

  p 2 = – m 2c 2 .    Thus  we  find  that

 U r

 f

 is not orthogonal to 

 U t

 for any  r  and any 

 f

t „ 0 .   An apparent consequence

   

is that the particle can be found at distances outside the light cone from the original region

of localization, implying superluminal velocity and possible violation of causality.  This is a

general result which applies not only to strictly  localized  states,  such  as  Newton-Wigner

states for particles of arbitrary spin (or their superpositions),  but also to  states  which  are

not strictly localized, but exponentially bounded [5].

The theorem alluded to above concerning Fourier transforms  reveals  another  well

known  problem  in  standard  relativistic  quantum  mechanics.    Even  states  which  are

localized at a particular instant of time  are  so  in  only  one  frame  of  reference  [1].    Such

2

states have infinite spatial extent in any reference frame moving with respect to that frame.

In the example just given, 

f r, 0  vanishes by premise for some  r ;  but  if  we  transform

  

   p | f

 and 

   p |U r | f

 into a frame of reference moving with velocity 

 v  in the direction

of  r  with respect to the first, and calculate their scalar product in the new reference frame at

~

t = 0, we obtain

.  Thus localization, if it occurs at all, is

any  r  because of the exponential in 

f ~ r, 0   cannot  vanish  for

   
” v / c ; and 

.    Again, 

  

  

not only an extraordinarily fleeting property, but one which seems to depend on the frame

of reference in which the state is prepared, measured, or defined.

These  problems  have  received  much  attention  in  the  literature  [14],  their  most

commonly  proposed  resolution  being  that  the  notion  of  spatial  localization  is  not  well

defined in relativistic quantum mechanics.  This is due to the fact that a localizing potential

or  measurement  interaction  may  cause  pair  creation,  indistinguishability  of  resulting

particles rendering localization meaningless.  Thus,  a satisfactory description must include

multiparticle states, namely quantum field theory [8,10,11,15].

 

While the above argument is undoubtedly valid for many systems, it is not clear that

it  generally  accounts  for  all  localization  problems,  nor  that  it  entirely  accounts  for  the

specific  problems  mentioned  above.    To  begin  with,  a  free  particle  has  no  localizing

potential,  besides  the  measurement  interaction,  which  could  induce  transitions  between

particle number states.  The measurement interaction itself might induce the transitions, but

this point remains obscure in the  absence  of  a  satisfactory  and  comprehensive  theory  of

measurement.   It should furthermore be mentioned that localization problems reminiscent

of  the  above  are  not  restricted  to  systems  involving  a  position  operator.    The  Einstein-

Podolsky-Rosen paradox [16,17] can be formulated in a way which makes no explicit use

of such operators [18]; nevertheless its nonlocal implications have yet to be fully reconciled

with special relativity [19].  A similar situation exists with Fermi’s two-atom system [20],

recently  reevaluated  by  Hegerfeldt  [21]  and  others  [22,23].    For  these  systems,  it  is

difficult to maintain that a localizing interaction and pair production are responsible for the

nonlocal effects.  On the other hand,  it has been argued that most,  if not all measurement

devices actually operate by measuring position [24-27].   Assuming this to be the case,  the

fact  remains  that  at  least  some  provisional  notion  of  position  must  remain  in  quantum

theory, if only to secure its experimental basis.

Fleming  [28]  has  pointed  out  that  the  existence  of  localized  states  in  a  well

established and widely used formalism, namely relativistic quantum mechanics, presents a

problem of interpretation which should be addressed within that formalism.  He argues that

it is not unreasonable to expect spatial localization to be a property of the proper frame of

reference of the apparatus which prepares or measures the state, seeing this as a relativistic

extension  Bohr’s  doctrine  that  the  physical  description  of  a  system  must  include  the

circumstances  of  its  measurement  or  state  reduction.    This  view  is  strengthened  by  the

observation that position operators in different inertial frames of reference do not commute.

Fleming proposes that a state  reduction  event  can  only  influence  events  forward  in  time

from the space-like hyperplane of the state-reduction event, though not necessarily within

the light cone of the localization.  This supplemental postulate eliminates causality problems

such  as  the  “grandfather  paradox,”  but  does  not  specifically  rule  out  superluminal

velocities.

Gaioli  and  Garcia-Alvarez  [29]  see  the  localization  problem  as  typical  of  more

general  problems  reconciling  general  relativity  and  quantum  theory,  the  different  role

played by time in the two theories being pivotal to the problem.  Treating time strictly as a

parameter, but position as an operator prevents their relativistic unification.  They propose

4

that the proper time formulation of quantum mechanics [30,31],  in which time in the  rest

frame  of  the  system  is  the  parameter,  but  time  in  other  frames  of  reference  may  be

quantized, can be considered as the prototype of a more general reconciliation of relativity

and quantum theory.  Characteristic of the proper time formulation, and its generalizations

such as the theory of indefinite mass [32-35],  is the fact  that  no  discrete  mass  states  are

derived.  External constraints are imposed to recover the mass spectrum found  in  nature.

This is related to the well known argument of Pauli [36], elaborated on by Allcock [37] and

others [38] that introduction of a time operator implies a continuous and unbounded energy

spectrum,  contradicting  the  existence  of  discrete  or  bounded  Hamiltonian  spectra.

Proposals to incorporate a time operator in expanded  formalisms have been published over

the years; summaries may be found by Jammer [39], Kobe and Aguilera-Navarro [40], and

in the context of the indefinite mass theory, by Kaloyerou [41].   Of particular relevance to

the localization problem, Horwitz and Usher  [42]  showed  that  states  with  equal  probab-

ilities of positive and negative energies do not exhibit the Hegerfeldt paradox.

In this paper the author proposes a separate, but related approach to the localization

problem by means of what has been called [43] the parametrization invariant formulation of

quantum mechanics.  In this formulation, as in the theory of indefinite  mass,  canonically

conjugate time and energy operators are introduced, but in this case the energy operator is

intrinsically  constrained  to  be  proportional  to  the  standard  Hamiltonian.    The  system  is

formulated and quantized according to an algorithm which was developed by Dirac [44-46]

and  Bergmann  [47,48]  to  form  a  quantum  theory  of  general  relativity.    This  so-called

Dirac-Bergmann  algorithm  provides  a  systematic  way  of  classifying  and  quantizing

constraints which prevent systems’ phase space variables from being independent.  It has

been applied to a number of problems, the most well known  example  being  the  Lorentz-

Landau  gauge  quantization  of  the  Maxwell  field  [49].    More  recent  discussions  of  the

theory of constraints can be found by Sudarshan and Mukunda  [50],  Sundermeyer  [43],

Lusanna [51,52], and Weinberg [53].  

5

It  may  come  as  a  surprise  to  many  physicists  that  the  parametrization  invariant

formulation (also called the “multitemporal formulation,”  especially for multiple systems;

see ref. [51]) does provide (and has provided for some time [54]) a satisfactory method of

quantizing the time variable, in both relativistic and non-relativistic quantum mechanics; at

the same time the discrete or bounded energy or mass eigenvalues for physical systems are

retained.  Although the time operator is Hermitian [55],  it is not an observable,  since  the

Dirac-Bergmann  algorithm  imposes  an  additional  requirement,  gauge  invariance,  on

operators for them to be called observables.  The author will show  that  in  this  expanded

formalism states borrowed from standard relativistic quantum mechanics, while they  may

be localized in space,  are not localized in time.  Their nonlocal time  distribution  accounts

for the Hegerfeldt paradox and the particular reference frame dependence without implying

superluminal  velocities.    The  system  analyzed  is  a  special  case,  the  free  Klein-Gordon

particle,  but  one  which  is  inade-quately  described  by  standard  relativistic  quantum

mechanics.  Elementary remarks toward extending the model to higher  spin  particles  and

interacting systems are given.

The organization of this paper is a follows.   In  Section  II  we  introduce  time  and

energy  operators,  develop  the  parametrization  invariant  formalism  for  a  Klein-Gordon

particle, and define observables for the system; the analysis of Section II generally follows

that  of  Dirac  [46].    In  Section  III  we  incorporate  Newton-Wigner  states  and  position

operators into the parametrization invariant formalism, extending  them  to  four-space  in  a

way which  maintains  their  spatial  localization  properties.    A  four-space  spectral  decom-

position of the position observable is obtained.  In  Section  IV,  the  localization  problems

outlined  in  Section  I  are  analyzed  in  the  parametrization  invariant  formulation,  and  the

apparent non-causal effects are found to be due to nonlocality in time.  It is shown  that this

also accounts for dependence of localization properties on a particular frame of reference.

Section  V  contains  a  discussion  of  results  as  they  relate  to  measurement  theory.    Con-

clusions are stated in Section VI.

II.    INTRODUCTION  OF  TIME  AND  ENERGY  OPERATORS

A time operator may be introduced for any relativistic quantum mechanical system

by taking the existing parameter ct as an additional  coordinate 

  q 0 ,  defining  its  canonical

conjugate 

  p0 ,  and  introducing  another  parameter  t   to  track  system  progress.    The
parameter t  is a c-number, is assumed to be monotonically increasing, has units  of  time,

and  may  be  identified  with  the  proper  time  of  the  system.    More  generally,  t   may  be

identified with time in any  frame of reference, through introduction of a gauge constraint,

without  changing  the  form  of  the  equations  of  motion  (hence  the  title  “parametrization

invariant”).    The  momentum 

  p0   appears  as  a  constrained  variable,  proportional  to  the

ordinary  Hamiltonian.    In  the  Dirac-Bergmann  algorithm,  constraints  are  classified

according  to  whether  they  Poisson-commute  with  one  another  and  with  the  canonical

Hamiltonian.  A generalized Poisson, or Dirac bracket is defined in a way which subtracts

contributions  from  non-commuting  constraints,  which  represent  unphysical  degrees  of

freedom [46].  

In  our  application  this  procedure  is  simplified  since  we  introduce  no  gauge

constraints, and for  the  Klein  Gordon  particle  there  remains  only  one  constraint,  which

necessarily commutes with itself.  Therefore, the Dirac bracket is the same as the Poisson

bracket.  The  constraint  relation  serves  as  the  generalized,  or  Dirac  Hamiltonian  of  the

system.   Quantization is accomplished by replacing the Dirac bracket with 

  1/ih   times  the

commutator and imposing the constraint on the state vectors of the system:  those states for

which  the  energy  operator  and  the  standard  Hamiltonian  yield  the  same  eigenvalue  are

considered the physical states.   One  then  adopts  the  Heizenberg  or  Schrodinger  picture,

respectively by setting up  Heizenberg  or  Schrodinger  equations  of  motion  involving  the

parameter t  in a manner analogous to standard quantum mechanics.  

Before  proceeding  further  we  describe  the  notation.    Position  coordinates  are

Cartesian  coordinates  plus  time, 

  q 0, q 1, q 2, q 3 = ct, x, y, z .    Repeated  indices  imply

  q 0, q , p0, p ,  etc.    Phase  space  variables  are  in  general  considered  functions  of  the

Let us  go back to the  Lagrangian  (2.1)  and  develop  the  parametrization  invariant

The  subscript  “S”  denotes  the  fact  that  the  resulting  Lagrangian  is  a  “singular”  system

inasmuch as  there  is  no  longer  a  one  to  one  correspondence  between  the  momenta  and

velocities (see below).  If we make the substitution

then,  for  the  general  case  of  L  depending  on  N  coordinates,  time,  and  N  velocities,

The four-momenta

 are not all independent; from inspection, it is evident that the

scalar product

 of the momenta is 

  m 2c 2 .   This will  be  identified  as  a  primary  first

class constraint,  formally written

” m 2c 2 – pm p m
   

» 0 .

(2.13)

The symbol 

 in (2.13)  denotes  a  weak  equality;  which  is  to  say  this  constraint  is  not
 

imposed until after all Poisson  brackets have  been  calculated  (the  Poisson  bracket  is  not

well defined otherwise [46]).  Using (2.5) constraint (2.13) can be written

   p0

(2.14)

i.e., the energy is proportional to the standard Hamiltonian.

The new Lagrangian 

 L S  is homogenous of the first degree in the velocities 

 q u  [true

of  all  Lagrangians  of  the  form  (2.8)].    Consequently,  from  Eular’s  theorem  on  homo-

geneous  functions  [58],  this  yields  a  vanishing  canonical  Hamiltonian,  defined  as  in

standard canonical theory by the Legendre transformation

   H C

” pm q m – L S = 0 .

(2.15)

The Dirac Hamiltonian, to be denoted 

 H D ,  is the sum of the  canonical  Hamiltonian 

 H C

and  each  primary  first  class  constraint  multiplied  by  an  undetermined  Dirac  multiplier.

Since 

 H C   vanishes  and  there  is  only  one  constraint  j

,  the  Dirac  Hamiltonian  consists

entirely of j

 multiplied the undetermined multiplier, u

.   Now  u

  has  no  conditions  on  it;

therefore, we are free to multiply it by 1/2m to provide a form analogous to standard non-

relativistic Hamiltonian for a free particle.   We thus obtain for the Dirac Hamiltonian

Defining  the  Dirac  bracket,  which  with  only  one  constraint  is  the  same  as  the

Poisson bracket [46],

we obtain the fundamental bracket relations,

The equations of motion for the coordinates,  (2.19a),   contain arbitrariness due to

the undetermined multiplier u

.   This illustrates the fact that the Dirac Hamiltonian  (2.16),

besides being the generator of motion, is a generator of gauge transformations.  Different

values of 

  q m

,  corresponding to different choices of the multiplier u,

  reflect only gauge

freedom, and cannot be physically different.   In this formulation observables are defined

as quantities which are gauge invariant.  Consequently, every observable is also a constant

of the motion; for the free particle this includes the momenta 

  pm

,  but not  the  coordinates

  q m
.

However,  if  we  subtract  from 

  the  spatial  velocity  multiplied  by  the  time

  q m

coordinate, we obtain a constant, and therefore gauge invariant expression.  Spatial velocity

is given by the relativistic expression 

pi p0 .  Thus, the quantity
  pi p0

  

Q i = q i –

(2.20)

has vanishing Dirac brackets with 

 H D .   There are three such quantities for i =  1,2,3.  The
  Q = Q 1 , Q 2 , Q 3   will  be  taken  as  an  observable  corresponding  to  the

three-vector 

position of the particle extrapolated to the time 

  q 0 = 0  [59].

B.    Quantization

The  system  is  quantized  by  formally  replacing  the  dynamical  variables  with

operators, replacing the Dirac bracket with the commutator divided  by 

ih ,  and  imposing

 

the constraints as requirements for the states to represent physical systems.   The classical-

quantum correspondence principle holds with classical quantities corresponding to expect-

ation values.  The Dirac Hamiltonian is

The constraint (2.13)  becomes an operator

states of the system.  Physical states 
   

  
P  are solutions of the constraint relation

P = m 2c 2 – pm p

This  constraint  is,  according  to  the  Dirac-Bergmann  algorithm,  only  applied  after

commutation relations (if present) have been computed.  Note that eq.  (2.26)  is equivalent

total probability is conserved over all space-time as t  varies.  Kaylorou [41] found a similar

continuity equation and interpretation for the modified Klein-Gordon equation.

Let us consider the continuity equation in the case of physical states 

  
P .   If we

substitute 

  
P  into (2.28),  the left member vanishes,  and we recover the  Klein-Gordon

equation (2.26).   Thus,  the Klein-Gordon  equation  may  be  interpreted  as  describing  the

“stationary states” of the system,  in  contrast  to  its  usual  interpretation  as  an  equation  of

motion.  It is well known [60] that when the Klein-Gordon equation is cast in the form of a

continuity equation 

   

being second order in

, due to its

equation.  However,  if we  substitute 

  
P   into  the  expanded  continuity  eq.  (2.30)  and

definitions (2.31) we obtain

   
P

=

(2.32)

which simply states that, for physical events, their probability of occurrence within a finite

region  of  space-time  is  constant;  there  is  no  net  probability  current  into  or  out  of  that

region.

Solutions of the Schrodinger equation which are also physical states are given by

(2.34)

Since 

 H D  has zero eigenvalue, the total phase rate of  change  of 

  is  zero.    This

  
P

does not imply the absence of motion since the phase in each tensor subspace changes as t

increases.  For  instance, if we project (2.33)  on  the  spatial  position  basis  states

(2.35)

The contribution to the phase rate of change from 

  p0  is absent in (2.35)  resulting in a net

increase in phase  as  the  parameter  t 

  increases.    Except  for  the  arbitrariness  due  to  the

undetermined  coefficient  u

,  (2.35)  is  the  same  wave  function  as  in  standard  relativistic

quantum mechanics.  In particular, the spreading of the wave packet due to the distribution

of values 

 pi  is predicted by (2.35).

Gauge  arbitrariness  associated  with  coordinate  motion  can  be  eliminated  by

imposing  an  additional  constraint.    For  instance,  imposing  the  gauge  constraint

' ” qm q m + c 2t 2 » 0 ,  and  reiterating  the  Dirac-Bergmann  algorithm  will  allow  t   to  be
   

identified  with  the  proper  time,  and  eliminate  the  undetermined  coefficient  u 

[61].

However, this additional constraint adds no new information over what is contained in the

observables.    For  simplicity,  in  this  paper  the  variable  t   will  remain  a  generalized

parameter, with its physical significance unspecified.

The  system  described  thus  far  is,  when  quantized,  a  spinless  (Klein-Gordon)

particle.    At  this  stage  it  is  possible  to  introduce  additional  degrees  of  freedom  which

correspond to spin.  A spin one-half (Dirac) particle is obtained by imposing an additional

constraint,  essentially  the  square  root  of  constraint  (2.26),  and  reiterating  the  Dirac-

Bergmann algorithm [43].    The  new  constraint, 

   
'' ” mc – g

m p m

» 0 ,  with 

 

  the  Dirac

matrices, becomes the Dirac equation when quantized.  Again, in the interest of simplicity

only  the  Klein-Gordon  particle  is  discussed  below;  localization  properties  of  the  Dirac

particle will be considered in a future paper.  However, this approach to the Dirac equation

brings up the point that quantization of systems with constraints imposed on the “physical”

state-vectors, instead of on the operators themselves, has been a part of standard quantum

theory for a long time.  The requirement that all physical particles have either whole or half-

integer spin is a constraint of the same type,  since nothing in the mathematics of quantum

spin precludes spin states with other quantum numbers [62].

III.    ADAPTATION  OF  NEWTON  WIGNER  FORMALISM

The  states  discussed  above  are  not  restricted  to  positive  energies  as  are  particle

states in the standard theory.  Newton and Wigner showed  [1] that positive energy states

can be constructed for a particular frame of reference which are instantaneously localized.

These states, here denoted 

 qnw ,  take their simplest form for the Klein-Gordon  particle,

where  they  appear  as  integrals  of 

m 2c 2 + p 2 1 41 4
  

p   in  the  (three-space)  momentum

representation:

Newton-Wigner  position  operator,  which  for  the  Klein-Gordon  particle  is  given  in  the

momentum representation by

(3.3)

The factor

 in (3.1)  permits the states 

 qnw  to be orthogonal for different

values of 

 q , but spoils their Lorentz covariance, consistent with the discussion in Section I

16

¶
that these states are localized in only one inertial frame of reference [1].  The same is true of

the extended Newton-Wigner states defined below,  and it will be  understood  henceforth,

unless stated otherwise, that the discussion pertains to a particular frame of reference.

A.    Extended  Newton-Wigner  States

It will now  be shown  how  the  Newton-Wigner  states  can  be  incorporated  in  the

parametrization invariant formalism.  We define extended Newton-Wigner  states, denoted

 qenw , to have the same spatial properties as 

 qnw ,  but to exist in a larger state space to

include time and energy operators.  We assume that 

 qenw  are physical states, that is,  they

are solutions of (2.26).  The states could be defined in a way which leaves the spatial part

of the Newton-Wigner states essentially unchanged as

  p1 | qenw   and  the  energy  function 

  p0 | qenw   [per

Taking 

  q 0 = 0 , the resulting states (3.7) are identical  to the conventional Newton-

  q 0 = 0 .  Note

that, in a manner similar to the states 

 qnw , the factor 

  p0

 qenw  permits them to be

(the second term, when multiplied by

B.    Observables  for  Extended  Newton-Wigner  States

As we found in the classical analysis of Section II,  observables  for  the  quantized

Klein-Gordon  particle  in  the  parametrization  invariant  formulation  are  constants  of  the

motion.  To obtain position observables, we must find the quantum operator corresponding

to 

 Q i  defined in eq. (2.20).  Let us look at what modifications need to be made to 

i
 q enw

 to

render  it  an  observable.    As  the  time  coordinate  changes  by 

D q 0 ,  the  spatial  position

   

   dq
dq 0

changes by 

D q 0 = vD q 0 , for every possible value of 

  p0 , p .  Therefore a constant of

the motion would be an operator with eigenvalues 

  q i – piq 0 p0

piq 0 p0 ,  for each possible value of

the velocity 

pi p0 .  The first term of the operator is unambiguously represented by 
  pi p0
   

D q 0   times  the  velocity;  however,  if 

For  the  second  term,  we  need  to  subtract 

i
 q enw

.

i
 q enw

  is

definite, the momentum, and thus  velocity  is  not.    Nevertheless,  for  relativistic  systems

described by Newton-Wigner states, the velocity is still given by the expectation value of

c pi p0   [64].    Thus,  if  we  subtract  from 
  c pi p0

i
 q enw

  each  possible  velocity    multiplied  by  a

corresponding change in time 

 we obtain a constant of the motion.  This results in a

   
0
D q enw

second term having 

0
  pi q enw

 in the numerator, and 

  p0  in the denominator.  But  since 

  p0

does not commute with the first term of 

0
  q enw

product  involving  the  anti-commutator, 

 [see definition (3.9b)], we use a symmetrized
  q enw

.    This  yields  for  the  position

follows:  it is the position of the system  extrapolated to the time

   q 0 < 0], it is where the system was (is) [will be] at

The  author  proposes  that  the  physical  meaning  of  the  operator   

j
 Q enw

t c   is  as

follows:  it is the measured position of the particle at the time  

t c  kept by the experimenter’s

 

clock.      When  a  position  measurement  is  made,  the  result  (position  eigenvalue)  is  a

property of the system being measured, but this result is associated with the time at which

the measurement is made.  The time of the measurement does not depend on the measured

system,  but  on  external  circumstances  (e.g.,  the  will  of  the  experimenter).    Therefore

t c does not relate specifically to the “time of the particle”,  

 

0
  q enw

, and as such is a c-number

in  (3.18)  instead  of  a  q-number  or  operator.   

j
 Q enw

t c   is  the  closest  analog  in  the

parametrization  invariant  formulation  to  the  three-space  position  operator  in  standard

quantum mechanics.

C.    Spectral  Decomposition  of  the  Position  Observable

The extended Newton-Wigner states,  although  eigenstates  of 

an  over-complete  set.    This  is  because  the  scalar  product  of  two  states 

  q 0', q enw ,  which  have  different  eigenvalues  due  to  the  difference 

j
 Q enw

t c ,  represent
  q 0, q enw   and
  q 0 – q 0' ,  are  not

orthogonal  according  to  (3.13),  preventing  us  from  interpreting  the  squared  norm

   
q 0, q enw | y

2

 for some state 

 as the probability of obtaining eigenvalue 

 y

 q t c .   The

22

trouble, of course, is that the energy 

  cp0  is strictly positive, giving the “time” distribution

(3.12) which is not localized.  The only way to remedy this problem is to allow the states to

have both positive and negative energies.  Such states would still “physical” according to

constraint (2.26), since the constraint is quadratic in 

  p0 .

Let us define new states 

 qloc  to be identical to the states 

 qenw  except that their

energy distribution is symmetric over positive and negative energies:

thus eliminating the  branch  point  at  the  roots  of

possible for states 

 qloc  and

  q loc

 to be orthogonal for 

   q 0 „ q 0' .    This  was  shown  by

Horwitz and Usher [42], in the context of the theory of indefinite mass,  to permit spatially

localized states which do not exhibit the apparent causality violations cited by Hegerfeldt.

It is reminiscent of quantum  field  theory,  where  both  positive  and  negative  energies  are

necessary in space-time propagators to maintain causality [65].

 

We  can  examine  the  time  distribution  of  states 

 qloc   by  taking

Eq. (3.24) function approximates the Dirac delta functional [and for m =  0 is formally the

same representation of the delta functional as eq.  (3.2)];  it is infinite  at 

  q 0 – q 0' = 0 ,  and

rapidly goes to zero, due to cancellation of phases,  as 

  q 0 – q 0'  increases.  From this we

may infer that the states 

 qloc  are in fact localized in time.

The author proposes that localization of the states 

 qloc   allows  them  to  serve  as

basis states in a quantum mechanical event  space,  making  it  possible  to  employ  them  to

construct a four-space spectral decomposition  of  the  position  observable

renders it meaningful, mathematically, to speak of a time distribution in reference to results

of measurements.

IV.    LOCALIZATION  PROBLEMS  REVISITED

In this section we reproduce the scenarios of Section I using the formalism devel-

oped  in  Sections  II  and  III.    Preparatory  to  doing  so,  it  is  worthwhile  to  recall  how  a

localized  wave  packet  might  be  expected  to  evolve  from  elementary  physical  consid-

erations,  if  it  could  be  assumed  that  relativistic  quantum  mechanics  provides  a  valid

physical  description  of  a  one-particle  system.    Because  of  the  distribution  of  spatial

momenta implied by the uncertainty principle, spreading of  the  wave  packet  is  expected,

but  at  subluminal  velocities  due  to  special  relativity.    Assuming  uniform  distribution  of

spatial momentum over all possible values, the most likely velocities are those approaching

the  speed  of  light,  resulting  in  a  space-time  probability  distribution  with  maxima

approaching the light cone.  The analysis given in this section, which constitute plausibility

arguments  based  on  geometric  considerations  of  the  space-time  distributions  involved,

suggest that the above results are precisely  what  is  predicted  by  the  model  developed  in

Sections II and III.  Questions regarding the generality of these conclusions must await a

more comprehensive analysis, which shall be presented in a future publication.

A.    The  Hegerfeldt  Scenario

For simplicity, we initially consider a state which is spatially point-localized at the

origin at 

   q 0 = 0, i.e., an extended Newton Wigner state 

  0 enw .   As a preliminary attempt

to  reproduce  the  situation  of  eq.  (1.4),  we  allow  this  state  to  evolve  under  the

parametrization invariant evolution operator 

 [defined in (2.34)],  and form  its  scalar

  U t

product with 

 U r

  0 enw , 

 U r  a purely spatial translation [defined in (1.2)].  This yields

(4.1)

Equation (4.1)  vanishes  for 

  vanishes  upon  imposing  the  constraint

(2.26).   As a matter of fact, 

 in general  makes  no  contribution  to  four-space  scalar

products,  as  long  as  no  commutation  operations  are  performed,  and  under  these

circumstances it may be omitted from the expression.  

Since (4.1)  can vanish,  it might appear  that  the  Hegerfeldt  theorem  is  overcome.

However, before so concluding one must ask,  from a physical perspective, why  does the

final  expression  (4.1)  not  contain  the  parameter  t ?    The  reason  is  that  the  state 

  0 enw

represents a physical event embedded in space-time, and according to continuity eq. (2.32),

its probability of occurrence does not depend on t .   As a matter of fact, since expression

(4.1) makes no reference to the time of measurement by an observer, we may conclude that

it does not correspond to the Hegerfeldt scenario.   In  Section  III,  the  observer’s  time  is

represented by 

t c , while in the standard theory it is represented by the t which appears in

 

(1.4).    So  the  question  remains,  given  a  system  described  by  a  Newton-Wigner  state

localized at position 

 0 at time 0,  may an observer find this system at position 

 r  at time t,

with 

  r > ct ?

We  can  answer  this  question  through  use  of  the  position  observable 

defined  in  (3.18).    The  expectation  value  of  the  position  measurement,  for 

 Qenw t c

t c   on  the

 

experimenter’s clock is

   
0 enw Qenw t c 0 enw =

d 4q

q t c 0 enw | qloc qloc | 0 enw ,

(4.2)

where we have used spectral decomposition (3.25)  in the right member.  From (4.2),  the

probability amplitude of obtaining the eigenvalue 

 r  is given by

   
ct c, r loc | 0 enw =

The amplitude  (4.3)  has  singularities,  just  as  in  (1.4);  therefore  it  does  not  vanish,  but

26

predicts finite probability of the system being found at position 

 r  at time 

t c = t ,  including

  

the space-like case 

  r > ct .  Hence the Hegerfeldt theorem formally remains.  

  

Nevertheless, a closer look will reveal that superluminal velocities are not implied.

In  order  to  better  illustrate  the  arguments  to  follow,  probabilities  corresponding  to  the

integral (4.2) have been evaluated numerically for one spatial dimension, and are plotted as
2

a space-time probability distribution in Fig. 1.   Discrete values of 

  
q 0 , q 1

loc | 0 , 0 enw

on a 101  

· 101 matrix were calculated and scaled so that distances are shown in units of the

Compton wavelength 

   
c = 2p h / mc  (

» 1.32 · 10 – 15  m for Hydrogen atom) [66].  Figure

  

1 shows that the probability distribution along the spatial axis 

  q 1  is in fact a (here discrete)

delta function, as expected, but along the  time  axis 

  q 0   the  distribution  has  finite  width,

falling  mainly  within  a  distance  of  the  order  of 

asymptotically approach the light  cone 

  
c about  the  origin.    Probability  ridges
   q 0 = – q 1   in  the  future,  as  well  as  the  past  (cf.,

Fleming’s remarks in reference [2] as well as discussion at the beginning of this section).

In fact, 

  
q 0 , q 1

 completely vanishes only on the line 

   q 0 = 0 where 

   q 1 „ 0

(although the scaling in Fig. 1 is too small to exhibit this).

Figure 1 illustrates the fact that  

  q | 0 enw  has wave components which represent
  q 0 = 0 .    Suppose  an

  q = 0   at  times  earlier  than 

passage  of  the  particle  through 

experimenter measured the position of the  particle  represented  by 

time  on  his  clock,  say 

t c = t 0 < 0 .    This  is  represented  by  the  operator

which has 

  ct , r  within its light cone.  By the same token, if we take

  c t 1 – t > r , we find that there are wave components in 

which had time to spread from 

  ct , r  to 

  ct 1 , 0  staying within the light cone of 

Additionally,  

with respect to t which permit subluminal velocity spreading to arrive at  or  from 

  q U ct, r 0 loc  itself has time components far in the past and in the future
 0 , 0 .

These components all contribute to the scalar product (4.3).

That  this  effect  may  be  attributed  to  nonlocality  in  time  rather  than  space  is

demonstrated  by  the  fact  if 

 qloc   is  substituted  for 

vanishes  [see  eqs.  (3.23)  and  (3.24)].    States 

 qenw   in  (4.3),  the  expression
 qloc   have  the  spatial

 qenw   and 

distribution; the only difference is their temporal distribution.  This  shows  that the overlap

of events  

  0 enw  and 

  U ct, r 0 loc   is time-like, and therefore that their non-orthogonality

does not imply superluminal velocities.

To  more  closely  approximate  a  physically  realizable  situation,  we  need  only

construct states 

  
P  which are superpositions of extended Newton-Wigner  states  over  a

purely spatial domain D.  The states will be localized, that is, they obey

P  have

strictly positive energy, they will exhibit the same nonlocality in time, leading to the same

explanation for spatial nonlocality as we found with states 

 qenw .

B.    Dependence  on  a  Frame  of  Reference

We are now in a position to clear up the mystery of the second localization problem

cited in Section I, namely, that a state localized in one inertial frame of reference has infinite

spatial extent  in  any  reference  frame  moving  with  respect  to  it.    Refer  again  to  Fig.  2,

which shows space and time axes in both the proper frame of reference, and in a frame of

reference  moving  relativistically  in  the  direction 

  q | 0 enw
   q 0 = 0,  we note that  in  the  moving  frame  of  reference,

t c = 0 .    Recalling  that 

 r   at 

  

vanishes only on the hyperplane 

since  the  Lorentz  transformation  involves  rotation  of  axes,  the  spatial  axes  are  not  all

orthogonal to the temporal axis of the original frame of reference.  Denoting coordinates in

the  moving  frame  with  a  tilde  ~,    the  projection 

  0 ~, q 1~

loc | 0 enw   of 

  0 enw   onto  the

spatial hyperplane passing through the time origin in the moving frame cannot vanish, since

the 

  q 1~  axes falls within the region of non-vanishing 

  0 ~, q 1~

loc | 0 enw ,  represented  by

the shading in Fig.  2.   However,  since  the  temporal  distribution  in  the  proper  reference

frame is highly peaked about 

   q 0 = 0 (see Fig.  1), 

  0 ~, q 1~

loc | 0 enw   falls  mainly  within

approximately a Compton wavelength of the origin (cf., Teller’s remarks in ref. [14]).

V.    RELATION  TO  MEASUREMENT  THEORY

 0 , 0  to

 0 , 0 ,

In Section IV it was argued that apparent superluminal propagation from 

  ct , r   is  accounted  for  by  wave  components  arising  from  points  other  than 

including those earlier than 

   q 0 = 0.   If this is so,  why  doesn’t  this  propagation  from  the

past  result  in  a  positive  probability  of  the  system  being  found  anywhere  on  the 

   q 0 = 0

hyperplane  besides  the  origin?  To  answer  this  it  should  be  recalled  that  the  extended

Newton-Wigner states 

 qenw  are tailor-made to have this property, and their vanishing on

that hyperplane is an  interference  minimum.    Wave  components  pass  through  all  space-

time, including hyperplane 

   q 0 = 0, and constructively interfere to a greater or lessor extent

everywhere except on that hyperplane.

31

The  above  arguments  involved  a  hypothetical  observer  taking  measurements  at

various times 

t c on his clock, in the past and  future.    Although  particles  in  the  paramet-

 

rization invariant formulation might go unobservably forwards or backwards in their own

time coordinate 

  q 0 ,  the  experimenter  and  his  macroscopic  world  only  move  forward  in

time 

t c ; hence the experiment is strictly gedanken.  Also, no mention was made of how  the

 

states 

 qenw ,  which  correspond  to  the  Newton-Wigner  state  in  standard  relativistic

quantum mechanics, could actually be prepared.    It  is  sometimes  supposed  that  an  ideal

measurement of position prepares a Newton-Wigner state.  Let us  assume for the moment

that this is the case.   Then,  in the gedanken experiment, the state 

  0 enw  is prepared by a

measurement of the system’s position at 

 

t c = 0.  But the hypothetical measurements at  

t c <
 

0 could (if performed) be influenced by the experimenter’s later measurement at 

t c =  0; the

 

“grandfather paradox” revisited.

However, if we extend Von Neumann’s reduction postulate [67] to the event space

basis developed in Section III,  then we may argue that an  infinitely  precise  measurement

with 

 Qenw  will yield a state 

 qloc , not 

the spectral decomposition (3.25).  States 

 qenw .  This is because it is 

 qloc  that appears in
 qloc  are localized in time; hence a measurement

at 

t c =  0 will not influence a measurement outcome at 

 

t c <  0,  and the  paradox  alluded  to
 qloc  have negative energy  components,  interference

 

above does not arise.   Since states 

between  positive  and  negative  energy  states  may  result  in  zitterbewegung,  which  in

quantum  field  theory  is  the  successive  creation  and  annihilation  of  particles  and  anti-

particles.  This line of reasoning is to some extent consistent with the view,  discussed  in

Section  I,  that  a  precise  position  measurement  yields  particle-antiparticle  pairs;  it  more

closely coincides with the proposal by Horwitz and Usher  [42],  that passage of a particle

through  a  position  localization  filter  can  be  thought  of  as  successive  annihilation  and

creation of the particle by the filter.  Such considerations open the question of whether it is

possible to set aside Fleming’s supplemental postulate, referred to in Section  I,  that  state

reduction events can only influence events forward in time from the space-like hyperplane

32

of the state reduction event.  These are issues which need further clarification.

  It is interesting to note that there is no “zeroeth operator,” corresponding to time,

which  could  be  grouped  with  the  three  position  observables

construct  an  operator  along  the  lines  of

view that time is not an observable in quantum mechanics.  The system’s “intrinsic” time,

0
  q enw

, attains an intermediate status: it is not a c-number, nor an observable, but a q-number

which may be given a meaning through its effect on measurable quantities such as position.

The  resulting  picture,  containing  three  “time”  variables, 

0
  q enw

, 

t c ,  and  t,   is  more

 

complicated than standard  relativistic  quantum  mechanics.    However,  it  may  be  that  the

standard theory, which recognizes only one time variable which serves as the parameter in

a given frame of reference, is too simplistic to deal with the combined geometrical meaning

of time in special relativity, its parametric role in mechanics, and the statistical interpretation

of quantum theory.  This inadequacy becomes more apparent when dealing  with  several,

possibly interacting systems, where as Von Neumann [67] states, each particle ideally has

its own time coordinate, as well as its own position coordinates.  

It remains a task to fully extend this model to interacting systems,  or to the theory

of  measurement.    The  two  problems  are  intertwined,  since  in  measurement  theory  the

measurement apparatus is a quantum system interacting  with  the  measured  system.    The

author  hopes  to  perform  an  analysis  in  which  the  time  variables  of  both  systems  are

quantized, with the aim of studying  the  relationship  between  Zurek  decoherence  [68,69]

and  the  localization  problem.    Such  and  analysis  might  be  extended  to  those  nonlocal

systems, mentioned in Section I, which do not explicitly involve a position operator.

VI.    CONCLUSIONS

In this paper it has been shown  that the nonlocality of states  demonstrated  by  the

Hegerfeldt paradox may be viewed as a temporal effect, not a spatial effect.  It is  known

that spatially localized states, such as Newton-Wigner states, exist at least  mathematically

for particular times; but without quantizing the time variable, we are left with the apparent

conclusion that such states blow-up to fill all the universe in an infinitesimally short length

of time.   However,  by  analyzing  the  problem  using  the  parametrization  invariant  Dirac-

Bergmann formulation, we are able to define position observables, and establish an event

space basis in which a quantum time distribution is a meaningful concept.  This allows us

to  find  that  the  states  in  question  are  not  localized  in  time;  hence  they  have  wave

components which are separated by time-like intervals, implying that propagation to distant

spatial regions occurs with subluminal velocity.  The time distribution  also  explains  why

localized states have infinite spatial extent in any frame of reference moving with respect to

it.  The Lorentz transformation rotates coordinate axes relative to the stationary frame, with

the result that spatial axes in the moving frame pass  through what in the original frame of

reference is the state’s time distribution.  Extension of the reduction postulate to the event

space basis allows resolution of apparent causality violations implied by the nonlocal time

distributions of the states borrowed from standard relativistic quantum mechanics.

1979) that the time operator must be anti-hermitian.  However, if one adheres to the

original  Dirac-Bergmann  algorithm  in  not 

imposing  constraints  until  after

commutation operations are performed, the problem constituting the main  premise

for his argument does not arise.  In this paper, hermiticity is assumed.

Abstract

      The  Resonant  Optical  Polarization  Radiation  (ROPR)  in  the  Smith-Purcell  geometry  and  the  one  from

the  inclined  grating  at  the  Tomsk  synchrotron  and  6-MeV  microtron  have  been  investigated.  The
polarization radiation was observed at 4.2o from the 200  MeV electron beam and at 5o from the 6.2  MeV

electron beam. Two methods of measurement of ROPR  maxima in these two cases have been used. In the

first  case  (the  experiment  on  synchrotron)  we  have  fixed  the  wavelength  of  radiation  using  an  optical

filter;  the  orientation  dependence  of  this  radiation  was  measured.  In  this  dependence  we  have  observed

two peaks of radiation from electrons in gold foil grating of 0.1 mm period. The first large peak is a  zeroth

order  peak  in  direction  of  specular  reflection,  and  the  second  one  is  the  1-st  order  peak  of  resonant

polarization  radiation.  In  the  experiment  on  microtron  the  spectra  of  ROPR  from  aluminum  foil  strip

grating  of  0.2  mm  period  in  the  Smith-Purcell  geometry  were  measured,  and  the  peak  of  the  1-st  order

Smith-Purcell  radiation  in  these  spectra  was  observed.  The  comparison  of  data  obtained  with  the

simulation results has been performed.

Keywords: Relativistic electrons, Grating, Resonant radiation

______________________________________________________________________________

In  the  late  90s  the  studies  of  radiation  in  conducting  targets  effected  by  relativistic  electron  field

[1-4]  became  more  active.  One  of  the  reasons  of  such  activization  is  the  need  for  noninvasive

diagnostics of charged particle beams. It may be noted that the field of investigations moved to the

optical  radiation  range,  because  in  this  field  there  are  simple  technical  means  for  measuring  not

only  angular  but  also  spectral  distribution  of  radiation,  which  may  considerably  increase  the

possibilities  of  beam  diagnostics.    Radiation  from  periodic  targets  is  attractive  because  of  the

presence of  resonances in direction, which is determined by the structure period of the target and

the  wavelength  of  radiation  being  under  study.  Thus  in  [8]  the  authors  carried  out  experimental

investigations  of  the  backscattered  optical  resonant  transition  radiation  emitted  by  3-13  MeV

electrons  on  a  sub-micron  grating  produced  by  deformation  of  the  conducting  surface.  The

measurements  were  made  for  large  observation  angles  and  different  radiation  wavelengths.

However,  in  view  of  complexity  of  the  targets  relief  the  experimental  results  did  not  gain  any

theoretical  confirmation.  Similar  investigations  presented  in  work  [9]  were  carried  out  using  the

MAMI  microtron  in  Mainz.  In  this  work  the  authors  also  observed  the  resonant  peaks  within  the

optical range on the sub-micron optical grating. The transition radiation, diffraction radiation (the

radiation emitted by a target during passage of a relativistic charged particle in the vicinity of the

target  edge)  and  the  Smith  –Purcell  radiation  (the  radiation  emitted  by  a  relativistic  charged

particle moving over a periodic conducting target (grating) parallel to its surface) are traditionally

considered. In reality, with  angular divergence of an electron beam, particles moving at the angle

to the target surface partially intersecting it (Fig.1).

To the polarization radiation concept.

1 is for the case of particle motion in the Smith-Purcell geometry,
2 is for the general case, 3 – is the particle electromagnetic field,
4 is the polarization radiation.

 All the above radiation types as well as their edge effects which cannot be described by traditional

models  may  make  their  contributions.  Thus,  the  study  of  resonant  radiation  at  the  inclined

incidence of electrons on the periodic target is also high-priority task. It should be noted that such

experimental  studies  have  not  been  carried  out  earlier.  The  condition  of  resonance,  which  for  the

SMITH-Purcell  geometry  has  the  form

, g  is the Lorenz factor of an electron.

Taking  all  of  this  into  account  we  will  consider  a  generalized  “optical  polarization  radiation”

(OPR) – the optical radiation of the target material during its polarization by an electric field of a

relativistic charged particle. We next consider the polarization radiation from relativistic electrons,

although the obtained results may be easily carried over to the case of other charged particles. We

will also discuss this radiation from the periodic targets (see Fig.1) consisting of conducting strips

separated by vacuum gaps or sputtered on a dielectric substrate. The effective transverse size of the
, where  g   is  the
field of a relativistic electron for its component with wavelength  l

  is  equal  to  g

Lorenz-factor of an electron. At sufficiently large  g   this  value  may  reach  macroscopic  sizes,  thus

enlarging in this way the area of the target polarization. In this case even at the inclined incidence

of  electrons  on  the  target  rather  considerable  number  of  strips  may  take  part  in  radiation,  which

may substantially increase the resonant radiation intensity. On the other hand, a relativistic shift of

the radiation frequency, if viewed at small angles to the direction of electron motion, enables one

to  obtain  radiation  from  the  macroscopic  periodic  targets  (with  period  of  hundreds  of  microns)  in

the optical range.

2.  Resonant optical polarization radiation of relativistic electrons. Theoretical model.

An exact solution of Maxwell’s equation for the problem, when a relativistic electron is moving in

the vicinity of an infinitesimally thin, ideally conducting semi-infinity plane [5], is taken as a basis

for  the  theoretical  model  to  calculate  radiation  from  the  periodic  targets  described  above.  On  the

basis of this solution, the expressions for the fields 

 the diffraction radiation from such a target

were derived in [10]. We will consider

observation point.

Then, using  Babinet’s  principle  we  may  write  down  the  expression  for  the  general  case  of  an

electron passage through the SP or in its vicinity

Now we may express the spectral and angular density of radiation

Recall  that  the  discussed  model  was  obtained  in  the  approximation  of  the  infinitesimally  thin,

ideally  conducting  target.  Further,  the  calculations  were  made  in  the  approximation  of  small

observation  angles  (

1

)  and  a  small  angle  of  the  inclined  target  with  the  electron  beam

directory  (

).  It  is  natural  that  the  targets  of  finite  thickness  and  real  electric  parameters

were  used  in  the  experiment,  although  they  were  maximum  approximated  to  the  ideal  ones.  The

same  model  was  used  for  the  case  when  the  strips  were  sputtered  on  a  ceramics  substrate.  The

substrate polarization was not taken into account. While calculating radiation for the experimental

conditions, the spectral and angular density of radiation was integrated over the angles within the

limits of the aperture used in the experiments.

There  are  two  possible  methods  of  experimental  study  of  the  radiation  angular

characteristics.  In  the  first  method  the  angular  distribution  of  radiation  is  directly  measured  by

moving the detector in the two directions which are orthogonal to the observation direction. Under

condition  of  strong  shielding  of  the  detector  from  x-ray  background  this  method  involves

considerable  technical  difficulties.  The  second  method  consists  in  measuring  the  radiation

dependence on the angles of the target orientation with respect to the direction of electron motion

and  the  radiation  plane  (orientation  dependence).    With  a  precision  goniometer  for  turning  the

target, this method enables one to obtain the same information as in the first one but with simpler

means of realization.

Using the described  model  the  authors  calculated  angular  and  orientation  dependencies  of

the  radiation  intensities  for  the  orthogonal  components  of  the  electric  field  vector  with  the  fixed

radiation  wavelength  as  well  as  the  spectra  of  the  radiation  intensity  for  a  certain  target  position.

Two  approaches  to  investigation  of  the  resonant  optical  polarization  radiation  of  relativistic

electrons in the grating have been realized experimentally.

1.  The investigation of the optical Smith-Purcell radiation.

In this experiment the spectra of radiation from relativistic electrons passing in the vicinity of

the periodic target (having the Smith-Purcell geometry) and intersecting it have been measured.

2.  The investigation of the resonant optical polarization radiation from an inclined periodic

target. The orientation dependence of radiation from relativistic electrons passing through

an inclined grating have been measured. In this approach the radiation in a narrow wavelength

range have been registered.

3.  Investigation of the optical Smith-Purcell radiation.

The experiment was carried out on an extracted beam of the  microtron which  is an injector of

the Tomsk synchrotron “Sirius”.

The main parameters of the microtron are the following:

1.  The energy of accelerated electrons E0=6.1 MeV
2.  The average current of the electron beam is 2.4 m A

3.  The transverse size of the electron beam is 300 ~ 1000 m m

A periodic structure consisting of metal strips sputtered on a ceramic substrate was used as a target. The

geometry of the target setup is shown in Fig.2.

In  this  experiment  d=0.1  mm,  a  =0.05  mm.  In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  effective  impact  parameter

heff=gl»10 mm (here g  is the Lorenz factor of an electron, l
is  much  smaller  than  the  electron  beam  size,  the  target  was  set  up  in  the  position  of  the  maximum  beam

intensity. In this case a part of electrons intersected the target and was scattered by the atoms of the target.

Using the described model one may calculate the dependence of the radiation yield per unit of the solid

angle on the radiation wavelength l

 and the angle of observation q

 (Fig. 3).

Spectral angular distribution of the Smith-Purcell radiation

Fig.3.

 It is evident from the figure that one can observe a resonant first-order peak in the visible part of the

spectrum  (l

» 0.7  m m)  at  the  observation  angle  »

  5o.  Fig.  4  shows  the  calculated  intensity  spectrum  of

radiation into the real solid angle for q =4.8o.

Fig.4.

An experimental setup for the measuring this spectrum is shown in Fig. 5.

Fig.5.

A  profile  of  the  accelerator  electron  beam  was  measured  using  the  bremsstrahlung  detector  with  the
vertical  motion  of  the  target.  Optical  radiation  from  the  target  was  collimated  by  a  slit  collimator  0.3/g

width.  An  optical  high-dispersion  prism  was  performed  to  measure  the  spectrum.  This  fact  enables  us  to

resolve the spectrum into an angular distribution over the wavelength. The variation of the wavelength in

the  spectrum  part  being  measured  was  achieved  by  the  turn  of  the  prism.  The  radiation  was  registered

using a broadband photo-multiplying tube (PMT). Two optical lenses formed the radiation from the target.

The  first  lens  formed  a  parallel  beam  incident  on  the  prism.  The  second  lens  focused  the  beam  on  the

PMT. The resolution of the spectrometer was defined by the width of the slit collimator on the PMT and
in the experiment it made up  » 20 nm. The energy calibration of the spectrometer (Fig. 6) was made over

the radiation from four light diodes with known wavelength.

The wavelength registered by the spectrometer v.s. the angular position of the prism in units

of the step monitor.

The spectrum of radiation from the target was measured for two components of the polarization vector

(for two components of the vector of radiation electric field: vertical and horizontal). For this purpose an

optical  polarizer  was  set  at  the  optical  path.  To  prevent  the  effect  of  the  spectrometer  time  drift  the
polarizer was installed in two positions differing by the 90o angle at each point under measurement. Also

measurements of the x-ray background were taken at each point. For this purpose  the optical path was cut

by  a  light  opaque  blind.  To  measure  the  spectral  efficiency  of  the  whole  spectrometric  path  we  used  a

familiar  spectrum  of  the  transition  radiation  from  a  thin  aluminum  layer  sputtered  on  a  silicon  substrate

0.43 mm thick. The spectral efficiency of the spectrometric path measured to the accuracy of  an constant

factor is shown in Fig. 7.

Fig.7.

 By means of the described experimental setup the Smith-Purcell radiation spectrum was measured in the

optical range for the two components of the radiation polarization (Fig. 8).

Fig.8.

Optical spectrum for two components of the Smith-Purcell radiation polarization.

Solid curves show smoothed experimental spectra.

The  spectrum  is  given  as  corrected  for  the  efficiency  of  the  spectrometric  path.  Hereinafter  the

measured values in the experimental dependencies are denoted by dots and the curves smoothing data – by

solid lines. In the figure one can see a pronounced first-order peak coinciding with the calculated one in its

wavelength (see Fig. 4) as well as certain indications of a third-order resonance.

There  areo even-order  resonances  in  this  geometry.  Theoretically,  in  the  Smith-Purcell  radiation  the

horizontal (in the described geometry) polarization component is negligible. The presence of considerable

contribution  of  this  component  in  our  experiment  is  explained  by  the  resonant  radiation  of  electrons

scattered by the material of a ceramic substrate of the target. Unfortunately, this experiment did not allow

us to obtain the absolute intensity of the radiation under study. The excess of the radiation intensity in the

resonant  peak  over  the  intensity  of  measured  transition  radiation  into  the  same  aperture  is  » 14.  The

calculated  value  of  this  excess  is  equal  to  12.5.  The  difference  may  be  explained  by  a  different  shape  of

the theoretical and calculated resonant peaks as well as by an error in correcting for the multiple electron

scattering in the target while the intensity of the transition radiation was being measured.

 

4.  Investigation of resonance optical polarization radiation from an inclined periodic target.

This section is concerned with the results of investigating the orientation dependencies of the resonant

radiation. The periodic conducting target with vacuum gaps between strips was used. The geometry of the

target setup is shown in Fig. 9.

Fig.9.

Geometry of the target setup on the path of electron beam.
 d = 20 mm, a = 100 mm.

The  optical  radiation  under  study  was  also  registered  by  the  PMT  with  low  sensitivity  to  X-ray

radiation. By means of the described model (1) one can calculate two-dimensional orientation dependence

of this target radiation intensity on the angle of the target orientation in the reflection plane as well as on

the orientation plane which is orthogonal to the electron beam direction (Fig. 10).

Calculated two-dimensional orientation dependence of the resonant radiation intensity.

Fig.10.

It is seen from the figures that one may expect a considerable contribution of radiation intensity in the

area of the resonance peak as compared to the intensity in the zeroth reflex area.

Fig.  11  shows  the  calculated  orientation  dependence  of  the  intensity  of  radiation  with  the  404  nm

wavelength on the target inclination angle in the reflection plane into the experimental aperture.

A basic scheme of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 12.

Fig.11.

Fig.12.

The  optical  radiation  from  the  target  was  collimated  by  a  slit  collimator  having  0.3/g   õ  2/ã  angular

size.  Radiation  from  the  target  was  measured  in  the  same  way  as  in  the  previous  experiment,  for  the  two

components of the polarization vector.  For this purpose an optical  polarizer  was  installed  in  the  optical
path, which was placed at each point under measurement in the two positions differing by an angle of 90o.

As in the previous experiment, the X-ray background was measured at each point.  An optical filter set up
D l 20 nm wide at the average wavelength  l =  404

in the radiation path cut out a narrow spectral band 

nm. To control the experimental setup and the methods, the orientation dependence of the back-scattered

transition radiation from a solid conducting target was measured (see Fig.13).

 Comparison of the experimental dependence with the theoretical one calculated for the radiation into

real  aperture  by  the  formula  from  [7]  testifies  to  satisfactory  potentialities  of  the  setup  and  the  methods

(Fig. 14).

In  the  experiment  the  orientation  dependences  of  radiation  from  the  periodic  target  in  the  reflection

plane were studied.  Fig.15 demonstrates the experimental orientation dependence of intensity of radiation

from the periodic target in the absence of an optical filter and a polarizer.

In  this  figure  one  can  see  a  very  weak  display  of  the  first-order  resonance  peak  at  the  angle  è=0.7o.

The  position  of  the  peak  corresponds  to  the  maximum  spectral  efficiency  of    PMT.  Inclusion  of  the
polarizer into measuring (Fig.16) exposes a polarization structure of the zeroth reflex (2~2.5o) but does not

reveal the dependence in the area of the resonance peak.

components of radiation polarization.

 Inclusion of the optical filter without  polarizer  into  the  optical  path  enables  us  to  see  the  resonance

peak more distinctly, although with a considerable loss in statistics (Fig.17).

Since  the  cause  for  weak  display  of  the  resonance  peak  might  be  insufficiently  high  quality  of  the

surface  of  the  aluminum  target  (difficulties  in  preparing  the  surface  for  the  target  with  vacuum  gaps)

similar  measurements  were  taken  with  the  target  consisting  of  golden  strips  sputtered  on  a  ceramic

substrate.  The  geometry  of  target  setup  is  similar  to  that  shown  in  Fig.9.  Orientation  dependence  of

radiation from this target with inclusion of a light filter without  polarizer into the optical path is shown in

Fig.18.

path.

Here  we  can  see  much  more  pronounced  display  of  the  resonance  although  it  is  much  smaller  than

theory predicts. In addition, even without a  polarizer  in  the  path  one  observes  the  structure  in  the  zeroth

reflex  peak.  Inclusion  of  a  polarizer  into  the  optical  path  reveals  strong  polarization  of  the  resonant

radiation in the reflection plane (normal to the strip direction) (Fig.19).

Conclusion

Despite their outward similarity (the investigation of  resonances  from  a  periodic  target  in  the  optical

range) with experiments made in [8,9], the investigations carried out by the authors differ essentially from

them in the properties of the object under study. The authors of [8,9] applied the optical gratings produced

by deformation of the target surface, whereas in our case the targets consist of flat conducting strips either

separated by vacuum gaps or sputtered on a dielectric substrate. In addition, the period of our targets is by

3 orders of magnitude higher than that of  targets used in [8,9].

In  our  experiment  two  approaches  were  taken  to  the  experimental  investigations  of  the  resonant

polarization  radiation  from  conducting  periodic  targets:  spectral  measurements  of  the  Smith-Purcell

radiation with electron  energy  6.2  MeV  and  the  measurements  of  the  orientation  characteristics  of  the

resonant  radiation  with  electron  energy  200  MeV.  In  both  cases  the  first-order  peak  of  the  resonant

radiation  was  distinctly  observed.  The  peak  parameters  in  the  Smith-Purcell  geometry  at  low  energy  of

relativistic  electrons  (g =12)  are  satisfactory  described  by  the  theoretical  model  in  the  approximation  of

perfectly  conducting,  infinitesimally  thin  target  with  the  use  of  Babinet’s  principle.  However,  at  high

energies of relativistic electrons (g =400) the ratio of the resonant peak intensity of the radiation from the

inclined target to that of transition radiation peak considerably differs from the theoretical ratio. The most

probable  cause  for  this  discrepancy  may  be  the  fact  that  at  large  g   the  difference  of  the  real  target

parameters from the ideal ones  (  the  finite  target  thickness  and  real  electric  characteristics    of  the  target

material)  comes  into  play.  Unfortunately,  so  far  there  is    no  approach  to  the  theoretical  solution  of  this

problem  for  real  target  parameters.  In  the  described  experiments  no  qualitative  deviations  from  the

theoretical model (such as the Wood’s anomaly in [8]) is found.

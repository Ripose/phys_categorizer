Abstract:  We  consider  the  possibility  of  obtaining  emergent  properties  of  physical  spaces  endowed  with
structures  analogous  to  that  of  collective  models  put  forward  by  classical  statistical  physics.  We  show  that,
assuming that a so called « metric scale » does exist, one can indeed recover a number of  properties of physical
spaces  such as the Minkowski metric, the relativistic quantum dynamics and the electroweak model.

I)-Introduction

A mathematical object is fully determined by its information content.

As information may be expressed by a number of bits, one can say that a mathematical object
is fully determined by a set of bits. The purpose of theoretical physics, on the other hand,
being describing physical systems as mathematical objects, it is to be admitted that, at the
most foundamental level of description, the definition of a physical system can be reduced to a
countable (eventually an infinite countable) set of bits. We call « cells » these elementary units
of information. The cells are identified by an index (an address)  k = 1 2,
,(cid:22) ,  and their internal
. This way of considering physics fits the usual reductionnist
states is taken as 
approach which is to explain complex phenomena that are observed at a certain scale by the
interplay of simpler phenomena occuring at a lower scale. Apparently high energy physics,
which appeals to more and more complex spaces (10 dimensional spaces for fermions and 26
dimensional spaces for bosons in string theories for examples) goes the other way around.

c  is the speed of light and 
physical meaning. In high energy physics this is the scale where the supernumerary
dimensions fold up. Here we rather consider that this is the scale of cells, that is to say the
scale where information itself looses its meaning.  Obviously it is to be proved that physics as
it is known nowadays,  may be reconstructed upon such bases. A few steps of this program are
considered in this article.

Information on cells, as defined above, is reduced to an address that is
k . So far cells are given no

to say an identification index k and to a (bivalent) internal state s
geometrical properties. Space-time for example must be an emergent property of the model
not a property of physical systems that would be postulated a priori.
The cells being devoid of geometrical properties, there must exist a scale, which we call the
metric scale, where the usual Minkowski properties of space-time are recovered. Just as
matter looses its chemical properties under the atomic scale (1
metric properties under the metric scale. The smallest part of space-time where the usual
properties of  (Minkowski) physical space can still be recognized we call a « site », a sort of
space-time atom.
To summarize, the structure of physical spaces, as it is defined in the model we put forward in
this article, is made of a countable set of cells and cells are divided up among sites. We call

any cell of a site is close to any other cell of the same site, that is to say all distances between
the cells of a given site vanish. A site is similar to a geometrical point so to speak and the
problem is that of understanding how the usual geometrical properties of physical spaces
develop from such an organization.
Naturally it would be interesting to know more about the metric scale, if such a scale really
does exist. It is certainly higher than the scale of some 100 GeV  which is now avalaible in the
most powerful machines. Many high energy physicists, on the other hand, think that the
coherence of present field theories is lost above a scale of, say, 1 to 10 TeV (
1
energies are now out of reach although those attainable in the LHC (Large Hadron Collider), a
machine which is to be built at CERN, would be sensitively closer.
Astrophysics is the only domain where so large energies could eventually be observed. The g
ray spectra of quasars display anomalies in the estimated metric scale range of energy indeed.
For example in the high energy gamma ray emission spectrum of the active galactic nucleus
(AGN) Markarian 421, the flux of 1 TeV photons is only10 5-
 of that of 1 GeV  photons (M.S.
Schubnell et al.[1]). This is a general phenomenon which several theories strive to account for.
According to the most accepted one, this anomaly is not to be related to the emission
mechanism but, rather, to a degradation process implying interactions between the high energy
photons and the infra-red and optical photons that are present in galactic and intergalactic
spaces. This explanation implies  that the spectra must strongly depend upon the distances of
quasars and therefore it is not really satisfactory. This obviously does not mean that a
satisfactory astrophysical explanation could not be found in the future but, for the moment,
this leaves room for the metric scale hypothesis to be an acceptable one.

III)-Intra- and inter-site physics

It is generally assumed that Nature obeys to some general principles and that not all states
 of a physical system are equally probable. Some are preferred which amounts to

saying that one can build a functional of states, namely a mapping of states in the set of real
numbers, such as the preferred states correspond to minimal values of the functional. Those
minima determine the dynamics of the physical system. Since time has been given no meaning
so far, it is not legitimate to call this functional an Hamiltonian (or energy) although we shall

 The physics of a given site is fully determined by the states of all cells of that site. If

the ratio between the site scale and the cell scale is10
suggested above, the number of cells per site is very high. A statistical mechanics treatment is
then necessary wherein sites are considered as « macroscopic » systems whose properties are
described by order parameters. Let us consider a particular site and let

This point is an important one. It shows that the fluctuations of the order parameter vanish
whatever the conditions at least as long as the number q of  cells per site is large, otherwise
the fluctuations are of the order of  1 / q . In other words, for this model, the mean field
theory is an exact theory.
The next point appeals to the Ginzburg criterion: According to this criterion the fluctuations
of order parameters of systems with finite connectivities z and dimensionalities d higher or
equal to  d = 4  vanish. For these systems, the domain of parameter  b
 where the mean field
theory does not apply shrinks to zero accordingly. The properties of fully connected systems
are thus similar to those of systems with  d = 4  and the order parameter f

So far a physical space is simply a set of points (the sites). The problem of

understanding how the usual geometrical properties of physical spaces develop from this set
may be related to the problem of  understanding how a given transformation of a Lie group
develops from the generators of the group.

of  positions)  and,  on  the  other  hand,  there  are  the  derivation  operators  (which  allow  the
definition  of  momenta).  To  make  them  more  precise  the  (symmetrical)  matrix  K  is
decomposed  according

Differential forms, as one can see here, introduce new types of fields. Another example is
brought about by the factorization of the G matrix. The product  G D  which appears in the
dynamics, is expanded according to:

The model we have developped so far may be summarized as follows:

The vacuum physical  space (meaning  a  space devoid of  excitations)  is  the  space-time  space
which develops from a series of generators which themselves build up on the vacuum state of
sites (meaning the state of lowest energy). This vacuum is necessarily disymmetrical. Particles
manifest  by  modifying  the  generators  so  giving  rise  to  a  sort  of  crumpling  of  the  vacuum
physical space.

characteristics of the fermion-boson interaction are fully determined by the  16 16
To  make  these  properties  more  precise  we  assume  that  the  interaction  «energy»  is  gauge
invariant which means that it remains unchanged under internal site symmetries that is to say
under  permutation symmetries  P . One therefore looks for  (
)P  which
make  a  representation  of  group  P4   while  leaving  the  matrix  X
  unchanged.  A  convenient
representation  is  obtained  by  considering  the  direct  product  of  matrices  associated  with  the
symmetries of the boson field  Q
 on the one hand  with those associated with the fermion field
 on the other. The first set, which describes the transformations of the boson field, is the set

This set of interactions gives labels to particles.
The  first  block  could  be  associated  with  particles  called  the  leptons.  The  basis  states  which
span  this  2  dimensional  subspace  are  labelled  by  a  bivalued  quantum  number,  the  isospin
quantum  number.  They  define  two  sorts  of  leptons.  One  of  the  isospin  quantum  numbers,
s
 labels  the    neutrino-
type  leptons.  Similarly  a  bivalued  isospin  quantum  number  is  attached  to  the  second  block
each determining a 3 fold sub space. This block could be associated with quark particles. The
first  isospin  quantum  number  s
  labels  the  (down-type)  d-quark  and  the  other
s
 the (up-type) u-quark. The three fold degeneracy of each of these subspaces is, of

The  model,  therefore,  seems  to  form  a  convenient  framework  for  the  description  of  the
Standard Model. It must be stressed, however, that it shows some short-comings. For example
it misses an  essential ingredient: the  parity non-conservation. On the  other  hand the  particle
masses cannot be computed without any further information regarding the interaction matrix
K.

IX)-Canonical quantization and path integrals

The fields whose dynamics have been derived in the preceeding sections are

quantized fields. This statement has to be proven. Canonical quantization is the quantization
procedure which fits best the present approach. As we know the canonical quantization is
associated to the properties of position and momentum operators. One therefore strives to
compute the commutator [
the position operator, the matrix element (

 of these two operators. On the basis which makes diagonal

More generally the model allows any aspect of the usual formalism of quantum mechanics to
be recovered. The path integral of Feynman is an example. Let us consider two states  F
a  et
a  is the correlation (or Green function) between the two states. The

The summation can be carried out either by considering all indices in turn or by selecting a
given permutation of indices and summing over all permutations afterwards. A specific
permutation is called a path « C ». With this last procedure the correlation function takes the
form of a path summation:

Actually the order parameter present (weak) fluctuations. The G matrix is site dependent and
the energy is then to be written as:

which, in the limit of continuous spaces, identifies with the usual general relativity expression:

In the model we put forward in this article the origin of space-time curvatures is to be found in
the fluctuations of the order parameters which determine the metrics of space-time. A similar
view is put forward by Moffat[7]. When fluctuations are ignored the metric tensor is constant
and no curvature shows up. Assuming that the fluctuations are very large would lead to
random metrics with the loss of all geometrical properties. We are therefore led to the
conclusion that the fluctuations, although non zero, are extremely weak which amounts to
saying that the number of cells per site is very large (since the fluctuations are proportionnal to
the inverse square root 1 / q of the number of cells ). This also implies that the parameter  b
,
which plays the role of the inverse of a temperature, is large enough, a condition which is also
necessary for an asymmetric vacuum state to build up.
The fluctuations of the metric tensor modify the dynamics of particles in a way which is easy
to understand. For the fermion dynamics we considered the following factorization:

(
JG = D

) (
DT

)

G D  on a basis whose size (m) is, for the time being, left

then we expanded the product (

associated with every solution. This may be interpreted as if all particles experience the same
gravitationnal field but have their masses changed by the effect of fluctuations (one keeps the
gravitation constant while changing the masses instead of changing the gravitation constant
while keeping the masses). This could be an explanation for the existence of the 3 families of
particles which have exactly the same properties except as regard their masses.
Here is the place where to make some comments regarding the problem of dimensionality. We
have argued that the minimal dimensionality of the physical space is  d = 4  but one can
wonder why not choosing another, higher, dimensionality. For example we could have
considered the five-dimensional space of Klein and Kaluza. The basic group is then the
symmetrical group  S 5  of the permutations of five objects and we must reduce a  G
representation of the group according to its irreducible representations. We find that  G
decomposes according to two one-dimensional representations on the one hand and one three-

dimensional representation on the other. This leads to a space endowed with a three
degenerate space dimensions and two time dimensions so introducing two different sorts of
light velocities. This space does not fit our conventional space-time physical space. A four-
dimensional space is enough to describe the properties of vacuum (the ground state of the
physical space), as far as fluctuations of the metric tensor are negligible. When they are not,
the description of physical phenomena may demand extra-dimensions which can be
considered as spanning the internal space of relevant particles. These spaces are linked to the
very existence of the particles and disappear when they are not excited. The point of view
which is put forward in this article is that dimensions are not intrinsic properties but that they
entirely depend on the nature of particles they house.

XI)-Summary, discussion, and conclusion

The synthetic view of physics we have nowadays owes much to the existence
of characteristic energy scales which determine specific types of particles. Although it is very
tempting to carry on in that direction and to imagine that quarks are themselves built on some
sort of more foundamental particles it seems that present speculations, for example those
which are discussed in string theories, are more focused on the properties of the physical
space itself. The present approach borrows to both points of view: Beyond the characteristic
energy scale which is associated to quarks a vast domain of energy would exist whose
foundamental entities would be « cells » with each cell carrying an elementary bit of
information. This domain would extend up to the Planck energy. The cells interact and these
are the interactions which build up all the geometrical and dynamical properties of the
physical space. All physical information is thus contained in these interactions, a point which
we think we have made clear enough when expressing the three foundamental constants the
Planck length is made of, namely the speed of light, the Planck constant and the gravitationnal
constant in terms of these interactions.  Obviously a significant step would be carried out if
some general principle would make us enable to determine the interactions. All what we did
so far has been replacing a set of constants by another, may be larger, set of parameters.

For the time being let us gather the various features whose understanding may be made easier
by the present model.
-The physical space is a 4 dimensional space.
-The dimensions are divided up into three equivalent space dimensions and one time
dimension.
-The metrics is the Minkowski metrics.
-The vacuum state is disymmetrical and disymmetry is necessary a condition for the various
dimensions to unfold.
-The physical space excitations may be viewed as local deformations of the metrics.
-The dynamics of vector type order parameters is determined by Dirac equations.
-The dynamics of tensor type order parameters is, at least for massless excitations, determined
by Maxwell equations.
-The interactions between these two types of excitations are divided up  in, and only in, three
types of interactions, namely in order 1 (e.m.), 2 (weak), and 3 (strong) interactions.
-More generally the model allows the Standard Model to be derived. The formalism of
electroweak interactions is recovered and yields, for the Weinberg angle, a value of:

are observed.
-The origin of gravitationnal interactions is to be found in the fluctuations of the metric tensor.

. One also has an explanation for the quantization of electric charges as they

It must be stressed that the model is not fully satisfactory particularly as regards the

parity non-conservation properties. On the other hand one could appeal to the central
hypothesis of the model, namely the existence of a metric scale, to consider some problems
pending in modern physics with a fresh eye. We end this article with these considerations.

i)-The first problem is related to the existence of  all sorts of infinite quantities in

theoretical physics, especially in perturbation theories. Those infinite quantities mainly arise
from the behaviour of high energy spectra of free particles. The existence of a metric scale
would make the spectra sharply diverge at the metric scale so introducing cut-offs in
pathological integrals. Of course this is the easiest way to solve the problem of infinities but
without any incentive to introducing cut-offs, the theoretical physicists prefer to appeal to
much more handsome techniques such as dimensionnal renormalization. One of the main
results of renormalization theories is that the interaction parameters are energy dependent. For
 for low energies to a = 1 128
example the fine structure constant increases from a = 1 137
in the range of electroweak interaction energies  » 80 GeV , which is observed. One could say
that if renormalization theories are essentially correct in domains  far from the metric scale,
they must loose their relevance in domains closer to the metric scale. Moreover the metric
scale makes it impossible for excitations whose wave lengths are less than this scale, to exist.
Any attempt at creating such an excitation would result in its decomposition in a number of
less energetic excitations.

/

/

ii)-The second issue relates to the problem of measurement and, more specifically, to

the EPR paradox whose relevance has been clearly established in the A. Aspect
experiments[8].
Let us remember that the A. Aspect experiments refer to the observation of  polarization
correlation between two simultaneously created photons and that they show that correlation is
still observed when the polarization of one photon is modified eventhough the distance
between the two analysers is such that they cannot be causaly related. The central idea of a
metric scale based explanation is that the two photons are created in one and the same site.
More precisely the state of cells in this site is a two virtual photons state. The site, however, is
not still integrated to the experimental environment: it is everywhere and nowhere. The
integration is induced by an analyser. At this very moment the creation site splits in two
distinct (detected) sites but since the distances between the cells of the creation site were all
zero, information regarding the polarization states are readily transmitted to the two detected
sites. It is to  be stressed that this mechanism does not appeal to extra variables and, therefore,
this model is not a hidden variable model.  This way of  explaining the Aspect experiments
looks a bit strange but it can be admitted that is is by no means stranger than  the many
universe hypothesis of  Everett[9].

iii)-The last problem we address is that of the homogeneity of Universe. This
homogeneity seems to contradict the causality principles of relativity at least in early Universe
since homogeneity makes it necessary for matter end energy to instantaneously spread into the
whole system. This has been explained by appealing to the so-called inflationary model of
Guth. The central role of this model is played by the cosmological constant  L
 of Einstein:

24

This term would have induced a strong repulsion during the very first moments of Universe.
The cosmological constant, however, has been introduced by Einstein for the sake of making
Universe a steady one. The discovery that Universe expands ruined its credibility. On the
other hand the inflationist model allows the cosmological constant to be given an  upper
bound of  L
cm_  which leads to a vacuum energy density, whose expression is:

however, this energy is  r

the sign that the nature of vacuum is misunderstood to say the least.
The metric scale could shed another light on this problem. Just as a neutron star may be
considered as a huge nucleus (in the sense of nuclear physics)  with the nuclear scale

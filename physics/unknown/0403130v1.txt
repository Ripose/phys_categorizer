Abstract 
After having shown that the formula which describes the Doppler effect 
in the general case holds only in the case of the “very high” frequency 
assumption,  we  derive  free  of  assumptions  Doppler  formulas  for  two 
scenarios presented in the revisited paper. 

 

 
 

1.  Introduction 
 

In  a  recent  paper  published  in  this  Journal,  the  Authors[1]  derive  Doppler 
formulas  for  the  classical  acoustic  Doppler  Effect  adapted  to  different 
scenarios.  They  extend  to  two  space  dimensions  an  approach  proposed  by 
Donges[2]. The purpose of our Note is to show that the Doppler formulas they 
derive hold only in the case of the “very  small”  period  assumption.  They  are 
small  enough in order to ensure  that the moving source emits two successive 
wave  crests  (positive  maximums)  from  the  same  point  in  space  and  that  the 
observer  receives  them  from  another  but  the  same  point  in  space.  We  also 
derive  for  some  of  the  scenarios  considered  by  the  Authors,  free  of 
assumptions Doppler formulas.

We  present  the  following  scenario  in  Figure  1.  It  involves  a  source  S  and  a 
receiver R, in arbitrary motion relative to an inertial reference frame K(XOY). 
PS  and  PR  represent  the  trajectories  of  S  and  R  respectively.  S(

represents an instantaneous position of S from where it emits wave crests when 
a clock CS(

of clocks CS(

measurement  of  dtS  and  dtR  they  remain  at  the  same  point  in  space.  If  we 
consider that dtS represents the “very small” period at which the source emits 
successive wave crests and that dtR represents the “very small” period at which 
R  receives  them,  we  can  consider  that  Eq.(6)  represents  a  Doppler  formula 
which holds only in the case of the “very small” period assumption. Expressed

Eq.(7)  is  the  starting  point  in  the  revisited  paper[1].  The  Authors  fail  to 
mention  the  limits  under  which  it  holds.  Similar  Doppler  formulas  are 
derived[3] considering that two observers S and R move in the space through 
which a plane wave propagates. Such Doppler formulas hold only in the case 
when  the  distance  between  the  source  that  generates  the  plane  wave  and  the 
involved observers is “very big”. 
The way in which we derived Eq.(7) shows that the time interval during which 
we measure the instantaneous velocity and the period of the oscillations in the 
wave are of the same order in magnitude.

accelerating motion with acceleration  a . At the origin of time, R is located in

The Authors of the revisited paper[1] consider the case when S is at rest at the 
origin  O  of  K(XOY)  and  R  moves  with  constant  velocity  v  in  perpendicular 
direction to the OX axis (Figure 3). In a free of assumptions approach, R0(d,0)

4.  Conclusions 
 

The free of assumptions approach to the classical Doppler Effect reveals some 
of its properties, obscured in many cases. They are: 

In the time interval between the receptions of two successive wave crests, 
the observer R has not enough information in order to reckon the reception 
period, 
The  Doppler  factor  is  not  linear  as  it  depends  not  only  on  the  relative 
velocity of observer relative to the source but also on the frequency of the 
source.

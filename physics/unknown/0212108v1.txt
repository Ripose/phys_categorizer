We present a “coarse molecular dynamics” approach and apply it to studying the kinetics and thermodynam-
ics of a peptide fragment dissolved in water. Short bursts of appropriately initialized simulations are used to
infer the deterministic and stochastic components of the peptide motion parametrized by an appropriate set of
coarse variables. Techniques from traditional numerical analysis (Newton-Raphson, coarse projective integra-
tion) are thus enabled; these techniques help analyze important features of the free-energy landscape (coarse
transition states, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, transition rates, etc.). Reverse integration of (irreversible) ex-
pected coarse variables backward in time can assist escape from free energy minima and trace low-dimensional
free energy surfaces. To illustrate the “coarse molecular dynamics” approach, we combine multiple short (0.5-
ps) replica simulations to map the free energy surface of the “alanine dipeptide” in water, and to determine
the
rate of interconversion between the two stable conﬁgurational basins corresponding to the

INTRODUCTION

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations1 on classical or
quantum energy surfaces provide a unique tool for explor-
ing the phase space of (bio)chemical systems at full atomic
resolution.
In the biological sciences, realistic MD simula-
tions of protein folding, complex formation and aggregation,
enzyme kinetics, channel transport, etc., hold the promise to
form not only the basis for new understanding of these fun-
damental processes but also to accelerate the development of
new drugs and treatments for diseases. However, these and
many other processes in (bio)materials occur on time scales
well beyond the reach of current MD simulations, even if
carried out with the most powerful computers available on
an approximate classical Born-Oppenheimer energy surface.
With femtosecond timesteps required to integrate the fastest
atomic motions, classical MD of (bio)molecular systems in
condensed phase is only starting to push into the microsecond
regime,2,3 and orders of magnitude less on quantum surfaces.
Remarkable progress has been made recently in overcoming
the time scale limitations of MD;4–9 circumventing them is
the goal of this work.

The fundamental difﬁculty in MD arises from the require-
ment to integrate the motions of “all” nuclear degrees of free-
dom, not just those of interest. This problem of time-scale
separation has been formally addressed in the projection-
operator formalism of Zwanzig and Mori10–12 by constructing
a generalized Langevin equation that describes the time evo-
lution in a “slow subspace.” The coarse molecular dynamics
(CMD) proposed by Kevrekidis and coworkers for equation-
free multiscale computations13–22 (see Ref.23 for a review)
builds on this general framework. The existence of an attract-
ing “slow manifold” for the mesoscopic evolution is assumed.
However, explicit constructions of the slow manifold and the

corresponding evolution equation, memory kernel, and noise
function are avoided by using MD to propagate the micro-
scopic system over intermediate times, as discussed below.
Here, we implement the CMD method to study arguably the
“simplest biomolecule,” alanine dipeptide (i.e., N-acetyl ala-
nine N’-methyl amide), dissolved in water. This system was
chosen as a fundamental fragment of protein backbones with
; and polar groups C=O
torsion degrees of freedom
and N-H that interact strongly with each other and the solvent
(see Figure 1). For this reason, the alanine dipeptide has been
studied extensively by theory and experiment (see, e.g., Refs.
24–33), and has been used as a model system to analyze the
thermodynamics and kinetics of conformational dynamics.9,34
The two major goals here are (1) to map the essential fea-
tures of the (coarse) free energy surface of the dipeptide, in
particular to ﬁnd stable minima and connecting saddle points,
and (2) to determine the rates of interconversion between the

II. THEORY

A. Coarse molecular dynamics

In CMD, the existence of an attracting “slow manifold”
is assumed. We start with a set of “coarse” variables that
parametrize this manifold; this means that the slow manifold
is the graph of a function over these variables (i.e., it does not
“fold” over them). We stress that these variables are “observa-
tion variables.” They do not span the subspace on which the
slow dynamics occurs (the “curved” manifold). There exists,
however, a one-to-one relation between trajectories on this
manifold, and the projections of these trajectories on the hy-
perplane spanned by the slow variables. The number of such
coarse (observation) variables should be at least as large (and
preferably, for computational economy purposes, the same) as
the dimension of the slow manifold. For macromolecular sys-
tems, such “coarse” variables will include descriptors of their
internal geometry, such as dihedral angles, radii of gyration,
end-to-end distances, number and type of monomer contacts,
etc. They may also include solvent coordinates, such as vari-
ables describing solvent coordination numbers and structures.
In a somewhat different context (e.g., kinetic theory descrip-
tion of ﬂuid ﬂow) the “coarse manifold” will be parametrized
by the hydrodynamic variables (density and momentum ﬁelds,
i.e., low moments of the molecular distribution over velocity
space; see for example Ref. 17). If necessary, non-linear cou-
plings between variables can be introduced, for instance, by
using the expectations of products of hydrodynamic variables
to parametrize the manifold, as in mode-coupling theories. In
the CMD approach to atomistic simulations, the assumption
is that microscopically evolving distributions in phase space
quickly become effectively low-dimensional.35

Along fast directions (such as those describing bond vibra-
tions), the distributions rapidly saturate, while they keep drift-
ing and spreading along slow directions (such as those de-
scribing large-scale conformational rearrangements). As time
progresses, the statistics of motions along the fast degrees of
freedom become slaved to the slow degrees of freedom. In a
peptide, for instance, the frequency spectrum of fast motions
associated with the amide C=O stretch vibration depends on
the environment described by the slow variables quantifying,
e.g., the type and amount of secondary structure and solvent
present. Geometrically, the ensemble-averaged trajectories re-
lax onto a low-dimensional, attracting, forward invariant man-
ifold in coarse phase space. This picture invokes an analogy
with the so-called “inertial manifolds” for dissipative partial
differential equations.36–38

The (expected) dynamics of the coarse variables are ex-
plored through short multiple replica simulations as follows
(see Figure 2): A coarse initial condition is prescribed, and
“lifted” to many microscopic copies consistent with (condi-
tioned on) the coarse variables. This “lifting” step is not
unique, since many distributions can be constructed that have
the same coarse variables. Lifting can be achieved, for in-

FIG. 2: Schematic representation of projective forward integration in
CMD for a two-dimensional coarse free energy surface. Short MD
runs (magenta lines) connect multiple nearby initial (red dots) and
ﬁnal conﬁgurations (blue dots). From the drift in the average coarse
variables (red and blue circles), a forward time derivative is estimated
which is then used in a projective forward step (black arrow). Lifting
(e.g., by using umbrella sampling) produces one or several conﬁgu-
rations at the projected position, from which multiple replica runs are
initialized. After maturing (thin green lines) by relaxing on the free
energy surface, the estimated drift in the average coarse variables is
used for another forward projection. In this schematic plot, “conver-
gence” to the free energy minimum is practically achieved in four
steps.

stance, by performing a short MD run with an added potential
biasing the coarse variables toward their new target values, as
in umbrella sampling.39 This approach works also for coarse
variables consisting of nonlinear combinations of the atomic
coordinates, as in the product variables of mode-coupling the-
ories. The initialization will necessarily be at least slightly
“off manifold;” that is, the fast degrees will not be initial-
ized to be the “correct” functionals of the coarse variables.
This discrepancy, however, will be quickly “healed,” as a rela-
tively short detailed simulation will bring the trajectory down
on the manifold (i.e., slave the statistics of the fast degrees
of freedom to the coarse variables). After this short heal-
ing or “maturing” period we monitor the detailed simulations
over short times, and estimate the time derivative of the slow
dynamics in the coarse variables. This time-derivative can
be used to extrapolate coarse dynamics over relatively long
time intervals; repeating the procedure (lift, short run, restrict
to coarse variables, estimate coarse variable time derivative,
project coarse variables into the future, lift again
) consti-
tutes the coarse projective integration schemes of Gear and
Kevrekidis,15,19,40 and allows us to extrapolate the long-time

C. Finding stationary points on the coarse free energy surface

In many practical applications, one is interested in ﬁnd-
ing the stable minima and the (unstable) saddle points on the
coarse free energy surface, rather than mapping the complete
surface. Protein folding simulations constitute one such exam-
ple with goals of ﬁnding the folded structure and the structures
at the “barrier” to folding. From Eq. (1), we expect that the
minima and maxima are stable and unstable stationary points
for the drift component of the dynamics in the coarse vari-
ables. We can thus use the dynamic information to search for
these stationary points on the free energy surface, i.e., minima
and saddles satisfying

of the local linearization, and testing whether a gap remains,
or whether an additional eigenmode is becoming slow). The
eigenvector of this local eigenmode will then suggest a good
additional coarse variable or combination of variables for
the augmentation. These approaches very much resemble,
in spirit,
tests for the adaptive mesh reﬁnement or adap-
tive step size selection in partial-differential-equation simu-
lations: there we compare the results using smaller (or larger)
timesteps and ﬁner (or coarser) meshes and decide whether to
reﬁne (or coarsen) the mesh. Here, in a completely analogous
way, we are pursuing the “adaptive coarse variable augmen-
tation” (and hopefully, in some cases, reduction!) for CMD
(and other multiscale) codes.

From the CMD analysis, we can also extract immediately
properties of the dynamics in the free energy wells. In particu-
lar, we can estimate the correlation time
for slow (diffusive)
motion at the bottom of a well from the slope of the drift ve-
locity with respect to the coarse variable:

in
lator in the high-friction (overdamped) limit. In many dimen-
sions, the characteristic frequencies are given by the eigenval-
ues of the Jacobian analogous to the derivative in Eq. (5). The
corresponding eigenvectors give the “normal coordinates” for
the overdamped motions around a stationary point.45

The dynamic information in the replica runs

can
also be used to extrapolate toward longer times. Instead of
propagating each of the replicas, we extrapolate the average
position of the slow variable, for instance linearly (exploiting
regularity of the expected coarse dynamics with time):

A long “projective” step
is then effected by re-initializing
an ensemble at the extrapolated value; this is the simplest
“Projective Forward Euler Method.”15 Clearly, instead of sim-
ply taking a linear interpolation between the ﬁrst and last
coarse values of a short run, we can record a short “tail” of
the coarse evolution after the quick maturing period and use
that to construct (linear or higher order) predictors.15,19,40

In the Ala dipeptide, we use a harmonic constraint on the
at its new target value. With
torsion potential to initialize
new initial velocities assigned from a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution, the fast degrees of freedom, such as bonds or sol-
vent positions, re-equilibrate rapidly and the newly initialized

state starts drifting again on the free-energy surface. It is in-
teresting that in addition to coarse projective integration and
to coarse Newton-Raphson, additional algorithms, like time-
stepper based coarse control21 and coarse optimization46, be-
come enabled, and they may be useful in analyzing these sur-
faces without ever explicitly closing Langevin equations on
them.

E. Reverse coarse integration and escaping free energy
minima

It is well known that whether one uses MD forward or back-
ward in time (i.e., whether one ﬂips the velocities of the ini-
tial conﬁguration or not) one obtains forward evolution of the
coarse variables. As discussed in Ref. 47, however, it is pos-
sible to integrate the coarse variables backward in time on
the slow manifold (i.e., on the coarse free energy surface)
exploiting projective integration as follows. After initializ-
ing at the molecular level, and running (whether with ﬂipped
or unﬂipped velocities) long enough for the lifting errors to
heal, we use the estimated coarse forward time derivative
or
to perform a relatively large reverse pro-
jection in time. Under appropriate conditions this is a stable
algorithm.48

We then (1) lift again from the projected
, (2)
run again MD (whether forward or backward in time) to ob-
tain a new estimate of the local, coarse forward-in-time
or
; and (3) reverse project again the coarse variable

backward in time.

What was discussed here is the simplest “projective For-
ward Euler” method used backward in time; it is clear that
more elaborate multistep coarse projective integration meth-
ods can be used to accelerate both the forward and reverse
coarse integration in our context. Notice that this “reverse in-
tegration” is useful not only in a microscopic/stochastic con-
text, but also in the case of stiff deterministic problems in gen-
eral, and even discretizations of dissipative partial differen-
tial equations48. Such generalizations of coarse projective in-
tegrations (including coarse projective Runge-Kutta, Adams,
and even implicit implementations of such algorithms in the
“coarse” case) are outlined in Refs. 15 and 40 and are the
subject of ongoing research in collaboration with C. W. Gear.
This “short step forward in the full space, large step back-
ward approximately on the manifold” can be used to system-
atically integrate the unavailable equations backward in time
on the free energy surface. For this one-dimensional problem,
the “saddle” is actually a “source,” i.e., an attractor backward
in time. Suitably initialized, reverse integration of

coarse backward directions are very stiff (i.e., a separation of
time scales prevails for the coarse variable drift), their effect
is quickly damped by the short forward integrations. With the
appropriate step choices, the reverse integration will proba-
bly only “see” the slow backward directions, and use them to
“climb back up” the slow backward path(s). Methods for the

ical systems (see, e.g., Refs. 49,50) can, under favorable time
scale separation conditions, be brought to bear on the compu-
tational endeavor of exploring the free energy surface through
reverse coarse integration.

F. Calculation of rates

We can also use CMD to estimate rates of interconversion
between states. Instead of performing one long run, we de-
termine the short-time dynamics in the space spanned by the
coarse variables from many short, appropriately initialized
replica runs. The replica runs are used to construct propaga-
tors. Assuming some degree of regularity (smoothness) these
propagators are then applied recursively to infer the long-time
dynamics. From
, we can es-
timate a propagator as a sum of
functions at the end points
of each trajectory:

given by Eq. (8). For diffusion on a linear potential
and
with
constant, the linear interpolation Eq. (13) is exact. If
the diffusion coefﬁcient is position dependent and possibly
anisotropic, appropriate generalizations can be constructed.
(Notice that our CMD approach does provide estimates of the
position dependence and the anisotropy of the diffusion coef-
ﬁcient.)

In a certain limit, the concept of an optimal path can be
helpful in rate computations. Optimization over coarse vari-
able paths can be performed using CMD timesteppers. We
can locally approximate both the deterministic and the “diffu-
sive” part of the evolution through the propagators estimated
from replica runs.
If we guess a coarse transition path be-
tween two coarse minima we can write down the coarse ac-
tion functional for this path. The coarse action functional can
thus be deterministically minimized, using, for example, dy-
namic programming methods. One can estimate the sensitiv-
ity of the functional to (discretized) path variations through
nearby short integrations; or, alternatively, “derivative free”
optimization methods can be used for this goal, and the con-
version rate computed (approximated) upon convergence of
the optimization.51 We have, in the past, solved discretized
coarse optimization problems for optimal parameter variation
policies;52 we are currently pursuing the application of the
same optimization methods for the computation of rates in
problems with coarse dimension higher than one.51

In many cases, the concept of the optimal path loses its sig-
niﬁcance in the computation of rates. Indeed, one now evolves
a state density over the coarse free energy surface, solving,
in effect, a Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of this
density and its stationary state. For a relatively low coarse-
dimensional problem (i.e., if the coarse free energy surface is
two- or three-dimensional) it should be possible to solve this
Fokker-Planck by convolving the propagators above.

In summary, we force the system to sample the dynamics
in weakly populated regions of the “coarse variable space”
through multiple initializations of the coarse variables. This

allows us to circumvent the problem that the short-time dy-
namics “fully” samples only the fast degrees of motion (as
conditioned on the slow “coarse variables”), but covers only
a small range in the slow variables. We are therefore trading
multiple initializations for long time dynamics. This allows
us to sample even the slow dynamics in the coarse variables.
This can be a computationally efﬁcient approach, as can be
understood for 1D diffusive barrier crossing. By constructing
and interpolating the propagators along the coordinate leading
across the barrier, the rate of crossing can be estimated for ar-
bitrarily high barriers. It is important to state, however, that
this procedure assumes the dynamics to be “smooth,” such
that propagators can be interpolated, and that the dynamics in
the coarse variables is Markovian at the time scale of the short
replica simulations.

Interpolating the propagators to solve a Fokker-Planck
equation brings up an analogy with the so-called “gap-tooth”
methods in Refs. 14,23. In this approach, regularity of the
solution of a Fokker-Planck equation in space and time can,
in principle, be used to accelerate a particle-based solver by
evolving particles in “patches” of space-time, separated by
empty gaps. Communication across the “gaps” of the “teeth”
in which the particle density evolves is, of course, the key to
the approach. The construction of successful boundary con-
ditions capable of effecting this may signiﬁcantly enhance the
performance of Brownian Dynamics type solvers23,53,54.

III. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS

›ﬁ(cid:138)

MD simulations of the hydrated Ala dipeptide are per-
formed with the sander module in the AMBER 6.0 simula-
tion package (University of California at San Francisco) and
the parm94 force ﬁeld.55 The dipeptide is simulated in a pe-
riodically replicated box with 607 TIP3P water molecules.56
Particle-mesh Ewald summation is used for the long-range
electrostatic interactions.57 The system is simulated at con-
stant volume corresponding to
bar pressure, as deter-
mined during an initial equilibration run. The temperature is
maintained at 300 K by weak coupling (10 ps time constant) to
a Berendsen thermostat.58 Bond lengths involving hydrogen
atoms are constrained using the SHAKE algorithm.59 After
500 ps of equilibration, we collect data for 7 ns, with conﬁg-
urations saved every 0.5 ps for analysis. All simulations use a
time step of 0.001 ps.

Replica runs are initialized by drawing particle velocities
from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. For rigid TIP3P wa-
ter, rigid body translational and rotational velocities are gener-
ated in the principal-axes system. Initial velocities along (pos-
sibly linked) constrained bonds of the dipeptide are removed
recursively.

B. Free energy surface

To map the free energy surfaces with CMD, we assume
that the distributions of fast variables (bond lengths, etc.) are
quickly slaved to the slow variables, and that the averaged
dynamics of coarse variables is governed by the underlying
free energy surface. We thus expect that the averaged projec-
tions onto the coarse variables drift over a short (here: sub-
ps) timescale towards free energy minima. Figure 4 shows
for runs starting from 13 dif-

From Fig. 5, we expect that Newton-Raphson type, contrac-
tion mapping algorithms for ﬁnding stationary points should
indeed converge to the free energy maxima and minima. We
test this for the most unstable saddle near
rad
(as determined from umbrella sampling). We save ten con-
ﬁgurations along a 5-ps MD trajectory with a tight harmonic
. From each of the
constraint holding
ten conﬁgurations, we start ten

tions with different velocities. Figure 7 shows the difference

Despite the scatter in the difference data of round 1, a lin-
ear ﬁt already predicts zero drift at
rad close to
the free energy maximum

tialized near

Before we illustrate the results, we should point out that
this is not a particularly “good” problem for coarse integra-
tion; indeed, for these conditions the average solution very
quickly (within 2 ps) ﬁnds its way to the bottom of the well.
Coarse projective integration will probably be beneﬁcial in sit-
uations in which the “healing period” is short compared to the
slow dynamics (i.e., if there exists a gap in the eigenvalues of
the linearization of the drift part of the problem). If a large
such gap exists (i.e., if there exists a long slow transient of the
coarse behavior towards the stable minimum), then projective
integration has the potential to accelerate the CMD conver-
gence there. Here, both processes – healing and drift of the

To escape from a free energy minimum we can also try to
use reverse integration. Whereas forward integration of the
expected coarse variables [here:
] converges towards
stable stationary points (i.e., free energy minima), reverse in-
tegration goes “up the mountains” towards source-type, unsta-
ble stationary points. For a one-dimensional coarse problem
the “saddle” is indeed such a “source.” We start from a conﬁg-

The time reversibility of classical mechanics is the basis for
one of the main objections to Boltzmann’s kinetic theory, the
so-called “irreversibility paradox.” Here, one might naively
expect that if we reverse each of the replica trajectories by
changing the sign of the initial velocities, our reverse integra-
tion scheme would turn into a forward integration. This is not
the case. For each of the initial structures along the reverse-
integration path found before, we run each of the 50 replicas
forward in time with initial velocities of opposite sign. The
resulting reverse
values are also shown in Figure 9, and are
found to agree well with those obtained for the original initial
velocities, illustrating the “irreversible” time evolution of the
averaged coarse variables. To qualify this result, we point out
that the integrator used in the MD simulations is not fully time
reversible because of thermostatting and the bond constraint
algorithm.

While reverse integration will take us “up” the free-energy
surface, it will eventually search for “mountain tops” rather
than saddles. Even so, it can still be rationally used as a
tool to help explore the free energy surface. For a coarsely
two-dimensional surface, techniques for approximating the
two-dimensional stable manifolds of ﬁxed points in dynam-
ical systems can be used to efﬁciently draw the surface by
reverse integration. In effect, a circle of points surrounding a
well-bottom gives a one-parameter family of initial conditions
for reverse coarse projective integration that can be used to
“triangulate” the surface. Computational approaches to these
problems for explicit ordinary differential equations are well
developed49,50 and we expect that they can ﬁnd good use in the

that, if close to a saddle a large separation of time scales exists
between a slow unstable mode and many fast stable ones, pro-
jective backward integration may indeed approach the saddle.

F. Kinetics of interconversion

To estimate the rate of escape from the

helical mini-
mum into the extended minimum, we apply the Chapman-
Kolmogorov relation, Eq. (9). The propagators are con-
structed from 56 of the runs of 50 replicas used before to
estimate the free energy derivative. We use a simple linear
interpolation of the propagators, Eq. (12), that ignores a small
translational correction for the narrowly spaced starting points
. Figure 6 compares the free energy surface predicted from

Our analysis demonstrates how CMD can use sub-
picosecond dynamics to extrapolate by three orders of mag-
nitude to nanosecond dynamics. One concern may be that in
a system with many wells, it will be impossible a priori to
sample all relevant space in the coarse variables. With re-

10

verse integration and Newton-Raphson search, however, we
can create propagators for ensembles of conﬁgurations that
connect between neighboring wells. Starting from different
initial structures in a given well, the search will lead to mul-
tiple exit routes from that well. The Chapman-Kolmogorov
iteration for this set of local propagators can then be used to
project forward in time and carry the system over barriers.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The CMD approach uses methods closely related to those
of other approaches aiming at the long time dynamics. In con-
strained dynamics,43 a single “coarse” coordinate is held ﬁxed
In
in time and the corresponding mean force is evaluated.
CMD, we evaluate instead the drift along a coarse variable re-
sulting from the interactions with the rest of the system. In
Voter’s parallel replica method,7 multiple replicas start from
the same conﬁguration with different velocities. After a ﬁrst
“transition” occurs in one of the replica simulations, as de-
tected by observing “coarse” variables, all replicas are moved
forward to the new conﬁguration and reinitialized. Here, we
use multiple replicas to determine the short-time dynamics in
the coarse variables. This allows us to construct paths out of
free-energy wells by recursive application of the Chapman-
Kolmogorov identity, by Newton-Raphson search for saddle
points, or, sometimes, by reverse integration. In the former
approach, information about the rare events is contained in
the tails of the propagators constructed from MD, similar to
the advancing replica in Voter’s parallel replica method.7

In the transition path sampling approach developed by
Chandler, Dellago and co-workers,6,61 extending earlier work
of Pratt,62 dynamic paths connecting reactant and product re-
gions are efﬁciently sampled with weights given by an appro-
priate action functional. This offers a direct and elegant route
to the dynamics of rare events. In CMD, we can use local
short-time propagators to build transition paths in the space
of the coarse variables. With the Chapman-Kolmogorov ap-
proach, we can estimate the kinetics of barrier crossing. In
addition, we can sometimes exploit reverse integration to con-
struct multiple coarse transition paths.

In the case of a single dominant “coarse path,” deterministic
optimization methods (preferably derivative-free algorithms)
may be wrapped around the coarse timestepper to locate the
path.

In the context of peptide folding and polymer dynamics,
Kostov and Freed63 have been extending the polymer projec-
tion approach of Bixon and Zwanzig64 to build Langevin dy-
namics models65 for peptide dynamics. In a mode-coupling
approach, the initially chosen bond-vector basis set was ex-
panded by adding products of modes, leading to an increas-
ingly accurate representation of the dynamics. Here, we avoid
an explicit construction of the generalized Langevin equations
Instead, we use “coarse timestep-
for the coarse variables.
ping” to close the evolution equations for the coarse vari-
ables. Mode-coupling approaches, as discussed by Kostov
and Freed,63 can be used to expand the set of coarse variables
in CMD if necessary. To explore conformation space, Huber

and van Gunsteren66 have developed a method that couples
the dynamics of multiple replicas to their average structure.
These authors point out that “the average structure of a swarm
of molecules converges faster to the structure with lowest en-
ergy than individual molecules do.” In adapted form, this is an
essential element of the CMD approach to mapping the coarse
free energy surface. In the Newton-Raphson search and pro-
jective forward integration of the coarse variables, we use the
time evolution of the averaged coarse variables to converge
rapidly to free energy minima. In an earlier paper, Huber et
al.67 have explored the idea of adding memory to molecular
dynamics to enhance conformational sampling.
In a recent
paper, Laio and Parrinello expanded on this approach and in-
geniously combined coarse timestepping with “building in” a
memory that allows the simulation to explore the free energy
surface by, in effect, ﬁlling up the wells.9 In their approach,
repulsive markers are left behind along a trajectory projected
into the coarse space. Eventually, these markers drive the sys-
tem over a barrier leading out of the well (and, in the pro-
cess, effectively mapping the well out). Our “stable manifold
through reverse integration” maps out the wells by essentially
reversing the deterministic part of the coarse dynamics.

We have shown here that CMD can be used for rapid
searches of the conformation space of ﬂexible molecules in
aqueous solution. We demonstrate how the results of multiple
short (0.5 ps) replica runs can be combined to determine the
free energy surface using two different methods. We have il-
lustrated how projective forward and reverse integration can
be used to move toward free energy minima and saddles.
We have also shown how dynamics at the sub-picosecond
timescale can be used to predict the slow (0.5 to 1 ns) kinetics
of barrier crossing.

These encouraging results show that CMD is a robust
method. From the work of Bolhuis et al.34 we know that ad-
ditional “solvent” coordinates are kinetically relevant. The
subspace monitored here does thus not cover the slow dynam-
ics completely. Similar behavior is expected in many practical
applications. While CMD is very ﬂexible with respect to the
inclusion of additional variables, the construction of slow (or
“hydrodynamic”) variables is often difﬁcult. Even for the Ala
dipeptide, Bolhuis et al.34 could only identify the second rel-
evant variable in vacuum, but not in water. Here, we show
that CMD can give promising quantitative results even if only
part of the slow dynamics is covered. An explanation for this
result is the averaging invoked here. By starting from conﬁgu-
rations with similar
values, but different drift directions (or

11

commitment probabilities), we average over additional slow
variables. Moreover, the presence of such variables is appar-
ent from the data as a large scatter in the drift velocities and
directions. Such scatter highlights the need to either add new
variables or perform additional simulations.18

In summary, the CMD approach provides an integrated
framework, individual components of which are closely re-
lated to various approaches aimed at overcoming the time-
scale problem in MD. Here, we have demonstrated that CMD
is a useful approach to extract thermodynamic and kinetic
properties of molecular systems, and to extrapolate their long-
time dynamics.

One of the ambitions of coarse computation is not only
to map “coarse phase space” effectively, but also to search
parameter space efﬁciently. Indeed, coarse bifurcation algo-
rithms can be implemented based on the coarse timestepper
approach that converge on parameter values at which qual-
itative transitions occur for the coarse dynamics (see, for
example,18,20,22).
In the present context, this would corre-
spond to ﬁnding the regime of parameters like temperature
or solution ionic strength at which coarse free energy wells
form. Such coarse timestepper based numerical bifurcation
and continuation techniques have been demonstrated for ki-
netic Monte Carlo, Lattice-Boltzmann and Brownian Dynam-
ics cases; we are currently transferring this computational
technology to the CMD context. Finally, the CMD approach
is not limited to dynamics on a classical energy surface and
can be implemented equivalently if the dynamics occurs on a
quantum surface as, for instance, in Car-Parrinello MD.68 In
this context, it is conceivable that the concept of “telescopic
projective integration” for systems with multiple gaps in their
eigenvalue spectrum40 may ﬁnd a fruitful application.

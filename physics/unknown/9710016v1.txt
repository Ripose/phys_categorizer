ABSTRACT

The Relationship between the Neumann system and the Jacobi system in ar-

bitrary dimensions is elucidated from the point of view of constrained Hamilto-

nian systems. Dirac brackets for canonical variables of both systems are derived

from the constrained Hamiltonians. The geodesic equations corresponding to the

Rosochatius system are studied as an application of our method. As a consequence

a new class of nonlinear integrable equations is derived along with their conserved

quantities.

1. Introduction

To deal with Hamiltonian integrable systems, we usually rely on some basic

procedures such as determination of action-angle variables, separation of variables,

and integration of equations of motion. In addition, it is often very instructive to

study relations which exist among some superﬁcially diﬀerent mechanical systems.

For instance, it is known that there is a close relationship between the Neumann

system [1] and the Jacobi system [2]. The Neumann system describes the motion
1 sphere, SN −1, under the inﬂuence of a quadratic

of a point particle on the N

potential in N-dimensional space. Although the Neumann system has been known

for more than 100 years as an integrable nonlinear mechanical system, it is still

−

under active study [3-7]. On the other hand, the Jacobi system describes the

geodesic ﬂow on an ellipsoid. At ﬁrst sight these two mechanical systems are

diﬀerent. However, Kn¨orrer [7] found the mapping from the Jacobi system onto

the Neumann system, showing that the two systems are essentially equivalent.

A more complicated problem was recently studied by Adler and van Moerbeke

[8]. They found that there are rational maps transforming the Kowalewski top and

the H´enon-Heiles system into Manakov’s geodesic ﬂow on SO(4).

In the present work we deal with some classical integrable systems such as

the Jacobi, Neumann, and Rosochatius systems laying special emphasis on the

relationship which exists among them. In sections 2 and 3, we deal with the Jacobi

and the Neumann systems in the framework of the constrained Hamilton formalism

with a set of second-class constraints. We calculate the Dirac brackets for canonical

variables in the Jacobi and the Neumann systems. We then transform variables

so as to reduce second-class constraints to ﬁrst-class ones. As a consequence, both

systems acquire gauge freedoms.

The relationship between the Neumann system and the Jacobi system is clari-

ﬁed by making use of the Gauss map introduced by Kn¨orrer[7]. As an application

of our method, we then study in section 4 the geodesic equations corresponding

to the Rosochatius system [9,10], which is also known as an integrable nonlinear

2

system. Hamilton’s equations for the N-dimensional Rosochatius system can be

obtained from the 2N-dimensional Neumann system. By the same token, we found

equations corresponding to the geodesic equations for the Rosochatius system from

those of the 2N-dimensional Jacobi system. We show that the equations obtained

are integrable by ﬁnding integrals of motion explicitly. The last section is devoted

to summary and concluding remarks.

2. The Neumann system

In this section we deal with the famous Neumann system [1] in arbitrary dimen-

sions in the framework of the constrained Hamiltonian formalism with second-class

constraints. Recently,various aspects of the Neumann system are investigated by

many authors [3-7], because the Neumann system is interesting as one of the sim-

plest integrable non-linear systems and it is closely connected to other non-linear

mechanical systems, such as those of the KdV, the Kowalewski top etc.. Our aim

here is to clarify the Poisson structure of the Neumann system.

Let (x1, ..., xN , v1, ..., vN ) be canonical coordinates, so that the Poisson brackets

are given by

Therefore, the term proportional to η in the Hamiltonian (1) vanishes identically.

We see that (7) also turns out to be an identity. It should be noted here that the

change of variables gives rise to a qualitative change of the class of constraints.

Namely, although Ω1 and Ω2 were originally second-class constraints, after the

change of variables Ω2 vanishes identically and Ω1 turns out to be a ﬁrst-class

constraint with the nonvanishing Lagrange-multiplier ξ. As a consequence, the

system acquires gauge freedom and ξ becomes the gauge parameter.

is also invariant under the gauge transformation (29), and so does the equation

multiplier in dealing with the constraint

N
k=1 xk ˙xk = 0 imposed on the system,
it can be regarded, on the other hand, as a gauge parameter. One notices that the

P

change of variables from vk to yk, (k = 1, ..., N), gives rise to a transmutation of

constraints from the second-class to the ﬁrst-class ones, so that a gauge freedom

appears through the gauge parameter λ in the system.

The Neumann system is Liouville integrable, because there exist N

4. The Rosochatius system

In this section we generalize the formalism developed in preceding sections and

consider the Rosochatius system [9,10] in the generalized framework. Let us start

with rewriting (48) in the form

where fi(q), (i = 1, ..., N), are regular functions of the coordinates qj, (j = 1, ..., N)

which correspond to those introduced in the Jacobi system. The function R = R(q)

is assumed to be given in terms of fi(q) as follows:

5. Summary and concluding remarks

In the ﬁrst part of this work we dealt with the Neumann and the Jacobi systems

in the classical framework of constrained Hamiltonian systems. We calculated

Dirac brackets for canonical variables. We noticed that a transmutation from the

second-class constraints to the ﬁrst-class ones occurred by changing dynamical

variables appropriately. As a consequence, both systems acquired gauge freedom

in terms of residual gauge-parameters.

We focused on the relationship between the Neumann and the Jacobi sys-

tems. The mapping from the phase space of the Jacobi system to that of the

Neumann system was executed by the Gauss map. Aﬃne connections appearing

in the geodesic equations in the Jacobi system are given by

Γi
jk =

1
R2

qi
bi

1
bj

δjk.

(104)

However, these aﬃne connections do not satisfy the identities which genuine aﬃne

connections should satisfy, because the geodesic equations are not all independent.

In the second part of the work we considered the Rosochatius system. We

derived the Hamiltonian

R for the Rosochatius system from the 2N-dimensional

Neumann Hamiltonian. The geodesic equations for the Rosochatius system should

H

be obtained by making use of the 2N-dimensional Jacobi equations. However, the

18

ﬁnal result given by (95) is by no means the geodesic equation for qi, because (95)

does not have the standard form of the geodesic equation, which is usually written

as

from (93),(94) and (95). These equations are geodesic equations in the 2N-

dimensional space described by the coordinates (qk, θk), (k = 1, ..., N).

We found that (95) are integrable and Ik, (k = 1, ..., N) are conserved quanti-

ties of the system governed by (95). In other words, the set of equations given by

(95) constitutes an integrable system dual to the Rosochatius system.

There are some important problems on the Rosochatius system with its dual

system left unsolved, such as ﬁnding classical solutions in arbitrary dimensions and

the problem of quantizing the Jacobi-Neumann and the Rosochatius systems. Some

classical solutions to the Neumann system have been found by several authors [6].

Quantization of the Neumann system is discussed in some extent by Gurarie [14].

We would like to discuss extensively those remaining problems in a forthcoming

paper.

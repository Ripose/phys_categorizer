Abstract. We formulate a new (1+1)D step model of potentially unstable vicinal growth that we call “C+ - 
C-“ model and study the step bunching process in it. The basic assumption is that the equilibrium adatom 
concentrations on both sides of the step are different and this may cause destabilization of the regular step 
train. We deduce equations of step motion and numerically integrate them to obtain the step positions on a 
discrete  time  set.  New  dynamic  phenomena  are  observed  during  the  bunching  process:  (i)  parts  of  the 
crystal  surface  undergo  temporary  evaporation  in  the  course  of  coalescence  of  two  bunches,  the  larger 
being the one that ‘goes back’, (ii) the minimal interstep distance appears in the beginning rather than in the 
middle of the bunch. We speculate that the latter may serve as a diagnostic criterion for a new universality 
class  constructed  from  the  time-  and  size-scaling  exponents  describing  the  bunching  process  in  the 
diffusion-limited regime. In particular the size-scaling of the minimal interestep distance lmin for first time is 
nN
/(1
−
l
, where N is the number of steps in the bunch and n is the exponent in the step-
obtained as 
step repulsions law U~1/d
 
Introduction.  The  interest  towards  the  introduction  of  novel  models  of  surface 
instabilities  was  recently  stimulated  by  experiments  where  simultaneous  step  bunching 
and  step  meandering  was  observed  on  growing  vicinals  of  Cu[1,2]  and  Si[3].  One 
important characteristic of the new type of bunching is that the size-scaling exponent of 
the average interstep distance is 0.29±0.05[1,2] while in most cases of experimental and 
theoretical studies it was found as 2/3[4]. In this paper we introduce the so called “C+ - C-
“ model and obtain both size- and time-scaling relations for the step bunches formed in 
the long times limit. Our results could be considered as a challenge for further theoretical 
and experimental efforts to clarify and extend the existing universality classes scheme of 
Pimpinelli-Tonchev-Videcoq-Vladimirova (PTVV) [5,4]. 
 
The  Model.  The “C+ - C-“ model is an extended BCF[6] model. One considers (1+1)D 
vicinal  crystal  surface  with  steps  descending  in  the  +x  direction.  First  one  obtains  the 
concentration  of  the  adatoms  C(x)  on  a  single  terrace  assuming  that  the  concentration 
fields on the neighboring terraces are not conjugated otherwise than through the step as a 
source/sink  of  adatoms.  The  additional  assumption  that  the  concentration  field  adjusts 
immediately  to  the  step  positions  permits  to  consider  the  steps  as  motionless.  Thus  the 
stationary diffusion equation is rather simple:

,  Ω  is  the  crystal  surface  area  per  atom.  Usually  n  takes  the 
canonical  value[7]  n=2  but  the  use  of  the  more  general  notation  n  permits  to  study 
systematically  the scaling behavior of the model. The  basic  assumption  of  the  model  is 
that the equilibrium concentrations on both sides of the step are different:

This difference is expected to destabilize the growing surface. 
The model was obtained[15] as an effective step model from a two-particle model[8,9]. 
The problem with the physical justification of the model remains for further studies but 
what should be pointed out is that modification of the equilibrium concentrations is also 
possible  due  to  different  factors  as  step  curvature  [10],  step  transparency  [11]  and 
electromigration of adatoms [12].

As seen the velocity of the i-th  step is  obtained as function  of  model  parameters  as  the 
flux F, the surface diffusion constant Ds, kinetic coefficient K, magnitude of the interstep 
repulsions  A  and  differences  of  the  type  Δxi=xi-xi-1  representing  the  widths  of  the 
corresponding terraces (the terrace between i-th and the i-1-st step in this example). The 
above  equation  is  transformed  into  dimensionless  form  with  four  dimensionless

Linear Stability Analysis. We carry out a simple linear stability analysis on the obtained 
equation for step velocity, Eq.(9), perturbing only the i-th step in the moving equidistant 
step train and thus changing the widths of the two neighboring terraces: 
+→Δ

 ,
−→Δ
where l is the initial (vicinal) interstep distance. Then, what determines the (in)stability of 
the step train is the sign of 
(un)stable. After some algebraic operations one obtains the instability condition in the 
form:

As seen, the stability of the regular step train is not function of the ratio
subsequent  study  we  will  show  that  this  parameter  also  does  not  enter  in  the  scaling 
relations  describing  the  late  stages  of  the  bunching  process  and  what  determines  the 
system’s behavior in this stage is only the combination of parameters denoted with S. The 
expression  in  the  l.h.s.  of  the  above  inequality  could  be  roughly  approximated  with 
(0.555.n+0.027)  in  the  range  n=1÷7  and  could  eventually  be  used  as  a  definition  of 
whether an interstep distance is a bunch one. In fact, the analysis of the linear stability of 
the whole step train shows that the instability condition is simpler, C
L > CR, but we leave 
the discussion on this issue for a further publication. 
 
Results.  We  integrate  the  equations  of  step  motion  using  fourth  order  Runge-Kutta 
procedure[13] (note that in this paper we restrict our study to the diffusion-limited regime 
of growth, d<<1) and obtain step positions on a discrete time set. These step trajectories 
are shown on fig.1a. Two new dynamical phenomena are illustrated on fig.1b: (i) parts of 
the  crystal  surface  undergo  temporary  evaporation  and  this  leads  to  coalescence  of  two 
bunches,  the  larger  being  the  one  that  ‘goes  back’,  (ii)  the  minimal  interstep  distance 
appears  in  the  beginning  rather  than  in  the  middle  of  the  bunch.  Thus  bunches  have  a 
maximal slope where steps join them after leaving  the bunch from behind and  crossing 
the terraces. The dependence of the minimal bunch distance lmin on the number of steps N 
in  the  bunch  is  shown  of  fig.2  for  different  values  of  n,  the  exponent  in  the  step-step 
repulsions  law.  The  obtained  dependence  lmin  ~  N  -1/(n+1)  differs  from  the  one  for  the 
classical case of bunching due to electromigration or Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect[4] which 
is lmin ~ N -2/(n+1) . In the latter case the minimal interstep distance appears in the middle of 
the bunch and the scaling behavior of the first distance is l1 ~ N -1/(n+1). Thus the “C+ - C-“ 
model is both different from and similar to the classical case. In fig.3 is plotted the bunch 
width Lb vs. bunch size N again for different values of n. The resulting dependence is Lb 
~N  n/(n+1). Time dependencies of the bunch size N and the bunch width Lb are plotted in 
fig.4. As seen, the time-scaling exponent β=1/2 of the bunch size is not dependent on n 
and this behavior is analogous to the ρ=-1 universality class in the PTVV classification 
scheme [5] and the time-scaling exponent of the bunch width Lb is 1/z = n/[2(n+1)], while 
in PTVV it is 1/z =(n-ρ)/2(n+1-2ρ) and they are the same only for ρ = 0. The results from 
the  complete  scaling  analysis  of  the  model  are  collected  in  Table  1  together  with  data 
from other models. 
 
Conclusion.  The  model  is  believed  to  recover  the  behavior  of  a  class  of  step  bunching 
phenomena  characterized  qualitatively  with  the  appearance  of  the  minimal  interstep 
distance  in  the  beginning  of  the  bunch.  Quantitatively,  the  size-  and  time-scaling 
exponents  are  different  from  those,  predicted  by  PTVV  [5,4]  and  fall  into  a  new 
universality  class.  Further  theoretical  and  experimental  efforts  could  show  the  proper 
place of the model studied here. At least, it will remain as one of the reference models for 
the further extension of the universality classes for step bunching phenomena.

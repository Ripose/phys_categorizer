We investigate propagation of light pulses in photonic crystals in the vicinity of the zero-diffraction point. 
We show that Gaussian pulses due to nonzero width of their spectrum spread weakly in space and time 
during the propagation. We also find the family of nonspreading pulses, propagating invariantly in the 
vicinity of the zero diffraction point of photonic crystals. 
 
 

Since  the  initial  proposal  of  the  concept  of  Photonic 
Crystals (PC) in 1987 [1] a number of studies showed that 
these  materials  with  a  periodic  modulation  of  the 
refraction  index  on  a  spatial  scale  of  the  order  of  the 
wavelength  of  light,  are  powerful  tools  to  control  and 
modify  the  propagation  of  electromagnetic  fields.  PCs, 
offer a possibility of engineering the dispersion properties 
of  light  to  yield  photonic  band  gaps  in  the  transmission 
and reflection spectra, thus they can be designed to act as 
light  conductors  or  insulators  [2].  PCs  modify  (in 
particular reduce strongly) the phase and group velocities 
of  light.  This  effect  produces  an  increase  of  the  photon 
lifetime  within  small  distances  and  creates  a  strong 
localization  of  the  electromagnetic  field  [3].  Recently  it 
becomes  apparent  that  the  PCs  can  also  modify  the 
diffraction  of  light,  in  that  the  diffraction  can  become 
negative if the refractive index is modulated in direction 
perpendicular 
light 
(1-dimensional  PCs)  [4].  Negative  diffraction  was  also 
predicted for acoustic [5], and matter waves [6] in periodic 
materials.

If the diffraction is positive at one edge of propagation 
band, as is negative at the other edge, an inflection point 
inside of phonic band can be expected, characterized by 
the vanishing diffraction. The vanishing of the diffraction 
has been shown for the arrays of waveguides in [7], and 
more  recently  for  2-  and  3-dimensional  PCs  [8].  The 
vanishing  of  diffraction  means,  that  at  some  particular 
point of parameter space, and for a given frequency, the 
curvature  of  the  spatial  dispersion  curve

All the above studies consider diffraction management 
of  monochromatic  light  beams.  For  pulses  of  nonzero 
width  of  the  spectra,  the  diffraction  can  disappear  for  a 
frequency 
frequency  only.  The  other 
particular 
components,  not 
the 
corresponding 
nondiffractive point, broaden diffractively in propagation. 
This  can  result  in  a  complicated  shaping  of  the  pulse 
propagating in the vicinity of the zero-diffraction point. In 
addition the presence of periodic modulation of refraction 
index  introduces  the  group  velocity  dispersion  [3], 
causing the temporal broadening of the pulses. Having in 
mind  these  two  ingredients  caused  by  PCs  (diffraction 
dependence  on  the  frequency,  and  appearance  of  group 

exactly 

to 

velocity  dispersion),  the  pulse  propagation  in  PCs 
becomes very complicated.   

This  letter  is  devoted  to  the  study  of  the  pulse 
propagation  in  the  vicinity  of  the  zero  diffraction  point. 
First  we  analyze  the pulse propagation  close  to  the  zero 
diffraction  point  for  PCs,  and  develop  the  normal  form 
description close to this point. Next, basing on the normal 
form  description,  we  analyze  the  pulse  propagation: 
calculate  numerically  the  evolution  of  the  shape,  and 
evaluate  the  (weak)  spatio-temporal  broadening  close  to 
the zero diffraction point. Finally we propose the families 
of the pulses with particular spatio-temporal form, which 
do not broaden in space and time during the propagation. 
Such  nondiffractive  pulses  in  PCs  are  similar  to  the 
X-pulses  in dispersive  and  diffractive  materials  [9].  The 
X-pulses  have  particular  envelopes  of  spatio-temporal 
spectra,  such  that  the  dephasing  of  different  spatial 
components  due  to  diffraction  and  dispersion  mutually 
compensates,  and 
the  pulses  propagate  without 
broadening.  Analogously  the  nonspreading  pulses,  as 
the 
suggested  by  us,  have  specific  envelopes  of 
spatio-temporal  spectra  in  the  vicinity  of  the  zero 
diffraction  point  which  mutually  compensate  dispersion 
and (weak) diffraction in propagation through PCs.

Solvability  of  (3)  results  in  transverse  dispersion 
relation  (the  dependence  of  the  longitudinal  component 
IIk   on  the  transverse  component 
⊥k  of  the  wave-vector 
of the Bloch mode), which, as calculated numerically, is 
given  in  Fig.1.  In  the  absence  of  the  refractive  index 
modulation 
  the formal solution of (3) consist of a 
set of parabolas (dashed curves in Fig.1) shifted one with 
respect  to  another  by  the  reciprocal  vectors  of  the  PC 
lattice 
.  They  represent  the  transverse  dispersion 
curves  for  uncoupled  harmonic  components  of  the 
expansion  (2).  In  nonparaxial  description  of 
light 
propagation  these  parabolas  are  to  be  substituted  by 
circles.  The  modulation  of  the  refractive  index 
 
0≠m
lifts the degeneracy at the crossing points and gives rise to 
the band-gaps in spatial wave-number domain (Fig.1). For

Next  we  analyzed  the  propagation  of  the  Gaussian 
pulses  solving  numerically  (7).  In  fact  due  to  the  linear 
character  of  (7)  we  calculated  the  shape  of  the  pulse  in 
spatio-temporal  Fourier  domain,  solved  analytically  (6) 
and  recovered  numerically  the  shape  in  space-time 
domain of propagated pulse. Series of typical results are 
given in Fig.2:   

In general we obtain an expected result that the Gaussian 
beams  disshape  during  the  propagation,  due  to  the 
dependence  of  diffraction  coefficient  on  the  frequency 
(term 4 in he r.h.s. (7)).

The  overall  spatial  broadening  of  the  pulsed  beam  is 
evaluated  by  analyzing  the  propagation  of  independent 
frequency components of the radiation, and by averaging 
over  frequency.  The  result  is  that  the  broadening  is 
the  efficient  diffraction  coefficient 
governed  by

We  searched  for  particular  spatio-temporal  shapes  of 
the  pulses  which  are  invariant  under  the  propagation 
described by (7). The pulse propagating invariantly with

We  note  that  so  called  X-pulses  are  propagation 
invariant  structures  residing  on  hyperbolas 
the 
space-time Fourier domain [9]. Here differently from [9] 
we  obtain  a  big  variety  of  invariant  structures  that  are 
mostly of bell shape in space-time Fourier domain (Fig.3). 
We generate several typical invariant structures. For this 
purpose  we  fix  the  desired  frequency  in  (7),  select  a 
particular  isoline 
  (i.e.  one  isoline  from 
const
Fig.3.)  and  generate  a  spatio-temporal  spectrum  of  the 
pulse  around  a  selected  isoline.  The  selection  of  the 
infinitely narrow spectra 
  results in tails of the 
pulse  expanding  to  infinity.  Therefore  we  generated  the 
spatio-temporal  spectrum  of  the  finite 
IIKδ   centered 
around  a  particular  isoline.  We  perform  the  inverse 
Fourier  transformation  and  obtain  the  spatio-temporal 
shapes of such propagation invariant pulses as shown in 
Fig.4.a,b. The finite spectrum on one hand results on finite 
in space and time pulses, on the other hand results in weak 
spreading  of  the  pulses  during  the  propagation  The 
distance at which the pulses spread sensibly (an analogue 
of the Reyleigh length) can be evaluated by assuming the 
spectral  components  dephase  during  that  propagation:

[10]  The above analysis strictly speaking is legitimate when the 
spatial period of refraction index modulation is by order of 
magnitude  larger  than  the  wavelength  of  the  light 
radiation.  The 
parabolic 
approximation,  mathematically  is  more  complicated, 
however brings to no essentially new results. Details will 
be reported elsewhere.

[12]  We  note  that  (5),  and  subsequently  (6)  can  be  derived 
phenomenologically,  by  inspecting  the  zero  diffraction 
(inflection)  point.  One  then  can  expanding  formally  the

longitudinal wave-vector 
δω, using particular smallness assumptions, and keeping 
the terms of leading order. This result in equation with the 
same structure as (6) however with undefined coefficients 
of the r.h.s. terms.

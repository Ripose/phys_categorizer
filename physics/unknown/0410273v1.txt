Abstract

We point out that even the most intense laser beams available today can
provide only a very small fraction (10−7) of the beam energy required to reach
the design luminosity for a future e+e− linear collider. This fact seems to have
been overlooked in the extensive literature on laser acceleration of charged
particles.

Since the early days of laser operation it was proposed that the associated electric
ﬁeld could be used to accelerate electrons or ions. Since the ﬁeld in a freely propa-
gating laser beam is principally transverse, acceleration cannot occur in vacuum [1]
but the ﬁeld must be modiﬁed by imposing boundaries such as structures that guide
the ﬁeld or by the formation of a plasma [2].

The goal of producing energetic electrons and ions using laser beams has been
achieved in the past decade [3, 4, 5] and exploits the availability of very short laser
pulses (sub-ps duration) of reasonable intensity [6]. For instance in [3] the emission
of electrons with energies extending up to 200 MeV are reported. Typically few nC
of charge are emitted, when integrated over all energies. The laser intensity was
1018 W/cm2 and the acceleration gradient deduced from the data, dE/dx
I
100 GeV/m.

The observed accelerating gradient is almost three orders of magnitude larger than
that achieved in radio-frequency linear accelerators where dE/dx
100 MeV/m.
However the length of the acceleration region achieved so far is extremely short as
compared to typical linear accelerators which are several km long.

We wish to point out in this note that in spite of the high gradient, laser acceler-
ation is not suitable for research in elementary particle physics. This is because even
if the short acceleration length is overcome, lasers cannot deliver the energy required
to reach the luminosity necessary for investigating new phenomena.

Future Linear Collider

To advance our present understanding of the elementary particles ever higher
p collider is the
collision energies are needed. In the hadronic sector, the Fermilab p
world’s highest energy machine at a cm energy √s = 2 TeV [7]. The large hadron
collider, to become operational at CERN in 2007, will collide protons on protons at
√s = 14 TeV [8]. The only future accelerator relevant for particle physics is the
proposed linear collider with e+ and e− beams colliding at √s = 1 TeV [9]. Because
electrons and positrons are not composed of quarks, an e+e− collider provides new
and complementary information to that which will be obtained from the LHC.

In the approximate expression for L in Eq.(1), Ne is the number of particles in one
bunch (assumed the same for both beams), A is the eﬀective area of the beam and fc
the frequency of collisions. To investigate processes of interest, the luminosity must
be in the range

where e is the electron charge. This energy must be supplied by the laser. The most
powerful short pulse laser in operation today is one of the arms of NIF. This has
delivered 20 kJ in the IR over a

10 ns pulse length [10].

We may assume that future research will make it possible to couple a signiﬁcant
fraction of the laser energy to the electron beam in order to satisfy the requirement
of Eq.(3). The diﬃculty arises when we consider the repetition rate. The NIF lasers
are based on glass ampliﬁers and can operate at a rate of 10−3 per second at best. On
the other hand for a future LC the required repetition rate is 104 Hz. Thus from pure
energetic considerations a laser accelerator misses the requirements of high energy
physics by a factor of 107. This conclusion is independent of the method used for
coupling the laser energy to the electron beam [11].

One could argue that by decreasing the beam area one could recover some fraction
of the factor of 107. This is not realistic since many other eﬀects prevent the use of
colliding beams of smaller areas than given above.

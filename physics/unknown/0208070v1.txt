A behavior of quantum states (superposition of two lowest eigenstates, Gaussian wave packet) in 
phase space is studied for one and two dimensional double well potential. Two dimensional potential is 
constructed  from  double  well  potential  coupled  linearly  and  quadratically  to  harmonic  potential. 
Quantum  trajectories  are  compared  with  classical  ones.  Preferable  tunneling  path  in  phase  space  is 
found.  An  influence  of  energy  of  initial  Gaussian  wave  packet  and  trajectory  initial  condition  on 
tunneling  process  is  analyzed..  Coupling  effect  on  trajectories  and  preferable  tunneling  path  for  two 
dimensional potential is studied.

The  quantum  dynamical  simulation  of  molecular

different  approximations  can  reduce  challenge.  But  any 
approximation has unavoidable drawback associated with 
impossibility  to  reproduce  inherently  quantum  effects 
adequately.  Before  using  an  approximation  one  needs  to 
know  about  correspondence  between  classical  and 
quantum  dynamics.  One  of  the  methods  to  learn  is  a 
comparison  of  quantum  and  classical  behavior  in  phase 
space. But the uncertainty principle imposes limitations to 
definition of quantum mechanics in phase space. In other 
words, there is an ambiguity which gave rise to a variety 
of different quantum phase space distributions. 
 
One  of  the  widest  used  of  them  is  introduction  of 
Wigner  transform  [1,2].  It  generates  from  coordinate-
representation  wave  function  the  real  valued  one,  named 
the  Wigner  function.  It  satisfies  many  classical-like 
conditions.  But 
the 
shortcoming  that  it  is  not  everywhere  positive  and 
therefore  cannot  be  a  probability  density  in  phase  space. 
To  overcome  a  drawback  of  Wigner  method,  an 
alternative  approach  using  the  Husimi  function  [3]  has 
been  developed.  Although  it  provides  a  quantum  phase 
space  distribution  which  is  everywhere  positive,  Husimi 
function does not satisfy all classical-like properties.  
All  previous  efforts  consist  in  seeking  for  an 
 
appropriate 
coordinate 
representation  function  to  a  real  valued  phase  space 
distribution.  Qualitatively  new  approach  proposed  by 
Go.Torres-Vega  and  Frederick  [4] 
is  based  on  a 
formulation  of  quantum  mechanics  directly  in  phase 
space. According to their work, the quantum phase space 
representation

complete set of basis vectors |q,p>. Quantum state can be 
represented  by  wave  function  dependent  on  coordinate

and  momentum  simultaneously.  Operators  of 
variables  are  non-local  thus  obeying  the  uncertainty 
principle.  They  are  constructed  in  such  a  way  that  the 
correspondence  between 
the  classical  and  quantum 
Liouville  equation  is  satisfied  the  best.  The  Hamiltonian 
operator is then built from the momentum and coordinate 
operators,  and  thus  the  Schroedinger  equation  in  phase 
space.  The  square  magnitude  of  wave  function  can  be 
compared  with  that  of  a  classical  density.  By  analogy  to 
Hamiltonian description of classical  mechanics, quantum 
trajectories  can  be  defined  from  probability  density  and 
fluxes.  These  quantum  trajectories  are  compared  with 
classical  ones.  It  is  another  way  to  analyze  classical 
quantum correspondence. 
  Many  problems  have  been  studied  by  solving  non-
stationary  Schroedinger  equation  in  phase  space  for 
different  potentials.  If  exact  analytical  solution  for 
in  coordinate 
definite  potential  can  be  derived 
representation,  the  same  conclusion  can  be  typically 
reached in phase space representation. Examples are - free 
particle  [5],  linear  potential  [6],  harmonic  potential  [4,7] 
and Morse potential [8]. More complicated potentials for 
which Schroedinger equation does not have an analytical 
solution  require  diagonalization  in  basis  set  of  known 
eigenstates for bound potential. 
 
The  purpose  of  the  following  work  is  to  study  the 
behavior of quantum state in phase space which does not 
have  analytical  solution,  namely  double  well  potential. 
This  potential  has  a  barrier,  hence  such  phenomenon  as 
tunneling  can  be  explored  in  this  sample.  Some  efforts 
have been made in [9,10]. We wish to represent this task 
in more details and in multi-dimensions. 
 
The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows. 
In  Sec.II,  we  introduce  general  equation  for  the  double 
well  potential  in  the  QPSR.  Sections  III  and  IV  are 
concerned  with  application  to  one  dimensional  and  two 
dimensional 
respectively.  Finally,  we 
summarize our findings in Sec.V.

Usually  it  takes  a  long  computation  time  for  deriving  of 
an. Nevertheless, one can only rely on a superposition of 
two  eigenstates,  to  explore  some  aspects  of  trajectory 
behavior.  It  is  especially  convenient  for  double  well 
potential because superposition of even and odd neighbor 
states gives one which is located at one of the wells.

For this time it passes through the barrier and goes back. 
After  half-period  of  tunneling  it  completely  concentrates 
in another well with antisymmetric shape.  
At  potential  parameters  a =0.1  and  E0=3  there  are 
 
four  eigenstates  whose  energy  is  lower  than  barrier 
height.  Linear  combination  of  two  nearest  states  at 
different time points is shown in Fig.3.1. 
 

 
Integration  of  this  system  gives  p(t)  and  q(t)  which 
constitute  quantum  trajectory  in  phase  space.  Unlike 
classical equations of  motion, system (2.9) has right side 
dependent on time. Moreover, each trajectory depends not 
only on the potential and initial condition, but also on the 
wave function. Having the latter for any moment of time 
one can derive r  and Jq, Jp from (2.6)-(2.7). 
 
Numerical integration of (2.9) can be performed if F1 
and  F2  are  continuous  function  of  p,  q  because  these 
variables change in time. This fact restricts application of 
numerical  methods  which  use  phase  space  discretization 
of wave function on a fixed grid. 
 
Thus, two principal problems may arise in procedure 
of  quantum  trajectory  deriving:  non-stationary  wave 
function  obtaining  and  numerical  integration  of  system 
(2.9). 
 
 
 
 
 
Neither  stationary  nor  non-stationary  Schroedinger 
equation does have an analytical solution. We can use the 
standard  approach  which  consists  in  expanding  of  initial 
state in eigenstates

behavior reminds a little classical one for particles whose 
total energy is less than barrier height (Fig.3.2a). 
 
At the same time it has something unusual. Firstly, its 
classical  energy  does  not  conserve.  This  fact  was  also 
found  in  [4]  for  motion  in  harmonic  oscillator  potential. 
Secondly,  the  trajectory  does  not  go  to  initial  point  after 
first revolution. 
 

As  seen  from  Fig.3.3.,  the  classical  separatrix  does 
 
not influence quantum trajectory. For instance, starting at 
points with classical energy lower than barrier height the 
trajectory  can  cross  the  seperatrix  few  times  without 
passing  to  another  well.  So  no  matter  what  the  classical 
energy  at  initial  point  is.  Tunneling  is  determined  by 
initial quantum state and initial condition of trajectory.

at p0=0, q0=3 and classical separatrix (2). 
 
 
As  a  matter  of  fact,  each  trajectory  tunnels  in 
different  ways.  Therefore  tunneling  of  single  trajectory 
does  not  provide 
information  about 
preferable tunneling path in phase space. To derive it one 
should analyze the swarm of trajectories. This approach is 
not  effective  due  to  the  very  long  computational  time. 
More appropriate parameter may be -Jq(p,0,t). We call it 
as  transferring  rate,  because  its  value  is  proportional  to 
line  of 
probability  density 
maximum potential barrier in phase space. Minus sign is 
set  due  to  probability  flow  from  positive  to  negative 
coordinates.  In  some  cases,  especially  if  the  wave 
function is periodic in time, it is more rationally to use the 
integral characteristic

The  graph  in  Fig.3.4  shows  I(p).  As  seen,  the  maximum 
almost  coincides  with  p=0.  Perhaps  it  is  caused  by  the 
fact that maximum of probability is located at this line. 
 
There are also two negative peaks. This is explained 
by the fact that some trajectories after crossing zero point 
q-line  move  clockwise  and  cross  it  again  from  the 
opposite side contributing to the negative part of transfer

and 100 a.u. (b) at the same initial condition. 

 

 

The  coordinate  at  p=0  after  first  circulation  is  3.00022, 
after  second  one  3.00089,  and  so  on.  Although  slightly, 
but  the  trajectory  diverges  with  every  revolution.  This 
accumulation  in  small  divergence  results  in  trajectory 
spreading from the initial loop and finally in transition to 
another  well  at  certain  time  (Fig.3.3).  Thus  tunneling 
occurs.  The  time  before  tunneling  happens  depends  on 
initial  condition.  Usually  if  the  initial  condition  is  closer 
to the point of  maximum probability density, the time of 
the  trajectory  staying  in  first  well  is  longer.  After 
tunneling,  the  trajectory  continues  to  circulate  in  another 
well. But now this motion is directed inside. Such motion 
lasts  until  time  is  equal  to  the  half  period  of  tunneling. 
After  reaching  this  time  point  the  trajectory  begins  to 
move  to  outside.  The  process  repeats  but  now  the 
trajectory  moves  anti-symmetrically  with  respect  to  q-
axis. This makes sense because the process is periodic as 
noted.  
During  passing  through  the  barrier  the  trajectory 
 
becomes bent. It is interesting that this bend is not at q=0 
but  usually  lies  at  0<q<1  for  all  trajectories  of  this 
quantum state.

B. Gaussian wave packet 
 

As noted above, the properties of quantum trajectory 
 
essentially  depend  not  only  on  potential  and  initial 
condition  as  in  classical  dynamics  but  also  on  the 
quantum state. Thus there is a need of study of a problem 
for  different  states.  In  spite  of  relatively  simple  study  of 
the state which is a superposition of two eigenstates, it has 
a shortcoming because the maximum density location and 
mean  energy  of  quantum  state  are  predicted  parameters 
and cannot be freely varied.  
 
The standard non-stationary method described above 
can  be  applied  to  any  initial  distribution.  The  most 
interesting is a study of the Gaussian wave packet

Its maximum can be placed anywhere in phase space, 
and  its  mean  energy  depends  on  it.  If  the  barrier  is  too 
high,  then  Gaussian  centered  at  p0=0  and  q0=qmax,  where 
qmax is a point of maximum probability, is a superposition 
of  two  lowest  eigenstates.  Thus  the  task  of  the  Gaussian 
the  previous  problem  of 
study  reduces  again 
superposition of two lowest states again. 
 
As noted above, the mean energy of quantum state E 
is  determined  by  the  initial  condition  of  Gaussian.  If  its 
energy is higher or commensurable with the barrier height 
then  the  packet  moves  freely  between  both  wells.  Its 
initial shape does not preserve and even breaks to pieces 
[10].  In  the  harmonic  oscillator  potential  such  packet 
conserves  its  shape  and  the  center  moves  according  to 
classical  laws  of  motion.  It  is  interesting  to  figure  out  if 
the  motion  of  the  center  in  double  well  potential  has  a 
special feature as well.

The  maximum  packet  was  placed  at  the  separatrix 
 
(E0=3),

it  and  outside.  Then 
trajectories  starting  from  maximum  of  packet  were 
calculated. As seen from Fig.3.5, the quantum trajectories 
do not obey the classical law of motion anywhere. So, the 
probability  maximum  of  Gaussian  does  not  have  any 
general special properties as in quadratic potential. 
 
In  classical  mechanics  there  is  a  sharp  difference 
between trajectories whose energies are lower and higher 
than the barrier height. In first case the motion is bound to 
one well. In the second case the trajectory moves around 
both wells. 
 

change  in  trajectory  behavior.  At  energy  3.66  (see 
Fig.3.6)  it  makes  one  revolution  in  the  first  well.  A 
number  of  revolutions  in  the  first  well  continues  to  rise 
with mean energy decreasing. For instance, at E=3.37 it is 
2. At very low energy, trajectory revolves in the first well 
for  a  long  period  of  time.  Unfortunately  numerical 
integration of system (2.9) cannot be carried out for such 
a long time due to accumulated errors. Slow rising of the 
probability density in another well at earlier time indicates 
that  some  trajectories  must  pass  through  the  barrier. 
Integration  of  (2.9)  identifies  them  as  trajectories  with 
remote  initial  point  from  the  maximum  density  point. 
Moreover,  the  more  remote  initial  point  of  trajectory  is, 
the less time for tunneling is needed (Fig.3.7).

Although  the  motion  of  quantum  trajectory  depends 
on  mean energy of quantum  state, there is no such sharp 
difference  in  behavior  as  in  classical  case.  At  relatively 
high  mean  energies  of  packet  the  trajectory  passes  to 
another  well  at  once.  Decreasing  of  energy  leads  to

Gaussian is centered at p0=1, q0=4; its energy E=1.08 
 
 
Now  we  can  conclude  some  general  features  for 
quantum dynamics in double well potential. If the starting 
point is further from maximum then it tunnels sooner, no 
matter  what  its  classical  energy  is.  Points  with  classical 
energy  lower  than  barrier  height  may  tunnel  at  once  but 
ones  with  higher  energy  stay  in  first  well  crossing  the 
separatrix  many  times  from  inside  and  outside.  In  the 
tunneling process distance between the maximum density 
and initial point plays an important role. 
 
Another interesting point is to analyze tunneling rate. 
Fig.3.8. shows that the tunneling rate increases till certain 
time  and  then  decreases.  The  peak  moves  from  negative 
value  of  momentum  to  zero.  Simultaneous  vanishing  of 
positive  peak  is  accompanied  by  appearance  of  negative 
one  at  positive  value  of  momentum.  It  indicates  that 
trajectories return to first well.

As  initial  quantum  state  we  used  only  superposition 
of the two lowest states. In this case, changing of coupling 
parameter  leads  not  only  to  the  shift  of  wells  but  also  to 
change of eigenstates which constitute the initial quantum 
state.  The  more  appropriate  option  would  be  to  take  the 
Gaussian as initial state because it does not depend on the 
coupling  parameter.  Unfortunately  it  cannot  be  used  due 
to cumbersome calculation procedure in 2D. 
 
In  two  dimensions  the  trajectory  can  be  visualized 
using its projection on different surfaces. The probability 
can  be  transferred  in  qx  and  qy  directions.  Therefore  the 
transferring  rates  such  as  -Jqx(px,py,0,qy,t)  and  -
Jqy(px,py,qx,0,t) can be considered as function of px, py, 
qy or px, py, qx respectively. It is practically to reduce the 
number  of  variables  making  some  of  them  fixed.  For 
example, if it is necessary to have transferring rate in qx-
qy  surface,  px  and  py  should  be  fixed  (usually  zero)  and 
Ix=f(qy), Iy=f(qx).

In  all  following  calculations  the  potential  parameters  in 
(4.1) and (4.2) are a =0.1, E0=3, g =0.5, b  is set such a way 
that  the  potential  minimum  would  be  zero,  s   is  varied 
from 0 to 0.3. Initial condition for the trajectory is px0=1, 
py0=1,  qx0=3,  qy0=1.  As  noted  above,  a  long  time  is 
needed  before  tunneling  happens.  Therefore  the  initial 
time point for trajectory is 0.45t . 
 

A.  Zero coupling 

 
 
At  zero  value  of  coupling  parameter  the  two-
dimensional problem reduces to the two one-dimensional 
tasks.  Thus  trajectory  projections  on  px-qx  and  py-qy

IV. APPLICATION FOR 2D POTENTIAL 

 
It is worth emphasizing that trajectory always moves 
clockwise. As a result, the Gaussian placed symmetrically 
to  p-axis  has  different  trajectories  which  start  from 
symmetrical points although their energy is the same. 
 
 
 
 
two  dimensions  has  been  also 
 
considered. The potential has one degree of freedom as a 
double well and another as a harmonic oscillator. There is 
a  linear  or  quadratic  coupling  between  them  (Fig.4.1). 
This  type  of  potential  has  application  in  study  of  many 
chemical  reactions.  One  of  them  is  isomerization  of 
malonaldehyde [11]. It has form for linear coupling

behave  independently  on  each  other.  It  is  clear  from  the 
fact,  that  this  potential  is  symmetric  with  respect  to  qx- 
and  qy-axes.  Therefore  trajectory  transition  to  another 
well does not influence form of py-qy projection, which is 
ellipse with center at origin. Transferring rate Ix(px) in px-
qx surface has the same form as in one dimension. In qy-
direction there is no tunneling. 
 

B.  Linear coupling 

 

 
If there is a linear coupling in potential, it is no more 
symmetrical  relatively  qx  and  qy  axes  though  it  is  still 
symmetric  with  respect  to  origin.  Value  of  sigma  is 
responsible  for  the  shifting  of  wells  from  qx-axis.  Now 
the  projections  of  potential  minima  on  qy-axis  do  not 
coincide. Therefore motion in different wells should give 
two ellipse-like curves whose centers are near to potential 
minimum.  It  has  to  effect  py-qy  trajectory  projection  if 
transition to another well occurs. Fig.4.2 shows that there 
is a bend in py-qy curve when tunneling occurs. This bend 
is more distinct if the coupling is stronger. An increase of 
s   leads  also  to  appearance  of  other  bends  in  py-qy 
projection.  They  are  typical  for  classical  mechanics  with 
this potential and usually correspond to sudden change of 
 

trajectory  direction 

in  some  projections.  px-qx 

the 
projection is almost uninfluenced by s . 
 
As seen from Fig.4.3, maximum of transferring rates 
in both directions is at zero point for any s . It is due to the

the  potential.  Thus  preferable 
central  symmetry  of 
tunneling  path  lies  along  the  straight  line  connecting 
wells. So it coincides with the line of minimum potential. 
As  expected,

unchanged  (Fig.4.3a)  but  in  qx-direction  increases  with 
increase  of  coupling  parameter  (Fig.4.3b)  because  both 
wells move away from each other in qy-direction.

C. Quadratic coupling 

 
 
The problem is more complicated if the potential has 
quadratic coupling. Projection on py-qy surface has more 
bends.  Now  coupling  raising 
influences  on  px-qx 
projection. It becomes more spreading in each well.

V. CONCLUSION 

 
 
 
Unlike  the  classical  mechanics  the  conservation  of 
phase space volume in quantum mechanics fails [9]. This 
fact  leads  to  more  sophisticated  structure  of  quantum 
trajectory.  Quantum  phase  space  structure  is  dependent 
not  only  on  Hamiltonian  but  also  on  the  initial  quantum 
state.  Therefore  the  classical  energy  and  probability 
density along the trajectory do not conserve.  As a result, 
the trajectory may cross the classical separatrix few times, 
while  staying  in  the  initial  well.  The  conception  of 
potential  barrier  loses  its  sense  in  quantum  world.  Sure, 
the  barrier  height  effects  (penetration  delaying)  quantum 
trajectory  but  it  is  no  more  the  wall  which  cannot  be 
penetrated.  
 
The  results  obtained  in  this  work  concerning  the 
description of quantum dynamics in double well potential 
have important information but they cannot be considered 
as absolute or complete because only two types of initial 
states  were  used.  Other  different  initial  states  may  give 
some new details.

Abstract

In  the  Earth-related  coordinate  system,  we  reconstruct  the  standard  model  of
cosmology based on the assumption of the cosmological principle and the perfect gas (or
fluid). We exactly solve Einstein’s field equation involved. The exact solution consists of
three parts respectively on the line element for space-time of the Universe, the value for
the cosmological constant and the equation of state for the matter of the Universe.

1. Introduction

The  current  standard  model  of  cosmology  starts  with  the  Friedmann-Robertson-Walker  line

element of the four-dimensional space-time,

under the assumption of the large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of space [1-12]. This line element is a
one having been represented in the co-moving coordinate system which,  at  any  point  in  space,  is  at  rest
with respect to the matter located at that point [9,10]. Just in the co-moving coordinate system, the time-
time component of the  Friedmann-Robertson-Walker  metric  is  assigned  to  be  time-independent,  g00 =1.
However, this line element is not a good starting point.
 
Measuring and describing motion is always relative to a certain frame of reference. We have a lot
of different frames of reference to select for the purpose, various inertial frames of reference and various
non-inertial  frames  of  reference.  Moreover,  an  observer  binding  to  the  selected  frame  of  reference  may
establish  different  coordinate  systems  to  interpret  his  measurements  and  descriptions,  like  Cartesian
coordinate  system  and  spherical  coordinate  system.  These  different  coordinate  systems  of  the  selected
frame  of  reference  contain  their  own  deterministic  contents  [13,14].  What  is  the  co-moving  coordinate
system? It is a coordinate system formed by connecting the small pieces of coordinate system that belong
to different frames of reference, which each is at rest with respect to the matter located in its  own  small
piece.  How  do  we  perform  experimental  measurements?  During  our  experimental  measurements,  do  we
change the frame of reference, from time to time, making it at rest with respect to the measured objects?
No,  we  never  do  so.  An  observer  or  a  group  of  observers  binding  to  one  frame  of  reference  usually
performs  experimental  measurements.  The  co-moving  coordinate  system  cannot  be  an  established
coordinate system of the one  frame  of  reference  in  which  experimental  measurements  are  performed.  In
the framework of Einstein’s theory of gravitation, due to its equivalence principle and general covariance,
we  can  select  any  frame  of  reference  and  adopt  any  coordinate  system  in  theoretical  calculations,
including  the  co-moving  coordinate  system.  But,  a  question  will  arise  when  the  co-moving  coordinate
system is adopted. How do we make comparison between calculation results and measurement data?  We
need,  in  principle,  to  know  the  transformation  between  the  co-moving  coordinate  system  and  the
established  coordinate  system  of  the  one  frame  of  reference.  Once  we  know  this  transformation,  we  can
transform  all  calculation  results  from  the  co-moving  coordinate  system  to  the  established  coordinate

1

system  of  the  one  frame  of  reference  and  compare  them  to  measurement  data  there.  The  said
transformation is a necessary step. The current standard model of cosmology seems to miss it.

In  the  present  paper,  we  do  not  intend  to  make  this  step  for  the  current  standard  model  of
cosmology. We prefer to start again. The paper consists of five sections: introduction, Earth-related frame
of reference, cosmological  principle  and  perfect  gas,  Einstein’s  equation  in  the  gravitational  field  of  the
Universe and its exact solution, concluding remarks.

2. Earth-inertial frame of reference

We are living on the Earth. We call such a  frame  of  reference,  in  which  the  Earth  is  always  at
rest,  the  Earth-related  frame  of  reference.  In  the  presence  of  any  gravitational  field,  the  Earth-related
frame of reference cannot be an inertial frame of reference. But, when all gravitational field is turned off,
the Earth-related frame of reference is at least approximately an inertial frame of reference.

We  have  selected  the  Earth-related  frame  of  reference  for  the  purpose  of  cosmological

measurements. We now select it for the purpose of theoretical calculations and descriptions.

3. Cosmological principle and perfect gas

To be able to  apply  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravitation  to  the  study  of  the  universe  as  a  whole,  we
need to simplify the physical system of the Universe. We are going on the assumption of the cosmological
principle.  It  says:  With  respect  to  the  Earth-related  frame  of  reference,  the  universe  is  spatially
homogeneous and isotropic on  large  scales.  Here,  the  homogeneity  and  isotropy  are  of  the  notion  of  the
average over large region of space.

A theorem [5] states that, for an N-dimensional space having its maximally symmetric subspace
of M dimensions, we are able to choose a coordinate system consisting of M  u p -coordinates,  p =1,2,---
,M,  and  N-M  v a -coordinates,  a =1,2,---,N-M,  so  that  the  line  element  of  the  N-dimensional  space  has
the form,

ds

g

v dv dv
( )

f v g

(2)

where  g

vab ( )   and  f v( )   are  both  functions  of  only  v a -coordinates,  g

upq ( )   is  the  metric  of  the  M-

dimensional subspace which reflects the maximally symmetric properties of the subspace.

The Universe existing in  the  four-dimensional  space-time  with  signature  (+,-,-,-)  has  the  three-
dimensional space of the large-scale homogeneity and isotropy with respect to the Earth-related frame of
reference. According to the theorem, there must be an Earth-related coordinate system, denoted by { x i },
i =0,1,2,3,  x 0 = ct , in which the line element of the four-dimensional space-time of the Universe can be
written as

  will  reflect  the  large-scale  homogeneity  and  isotropy  of  space.  Evidently,  the

takes value of +1 or 0 or -1, separately characterizing a closed or flat or open space. In this way, the line
element  of  space-time  of  the  Universe  obeying  the  cosmological  principle  is  determined  up  to  two
arbitrary time-dependent functions,  S t2 ( )  and  R t2 ( ) , i.e.

signature.  We  abandon  the  co-moving  coordinate  system.  Instead,  we  take  the  Earth-related  coordinate
system at the expense of one more time-dependent factor to be determined.

,

The  cosmological  principle  also  implies  that  the  Universe  is  filled  with  the  gravity-interacting
matter which distributes uniformly in space. That means that non-zero mass density ρ of the matter of the
Universe  is  independent  of  spatial  coordinates.  It  is  independent  of  time  coordinate,  too.  Otherwise,  we
will  face  the  problem  that  mass  would  be  created  (or  annihilated)  with  the  same  rate  everywhere  in  an
arbitrarily big but finite spatial region.

The  matter  of  the  Universe  is  also  treated  as  a  perfect  gas  (or  fluid):  Its  velocity  vanishes
everywhere  with  respect  to  the  Earth-related  frame  of  reference.  This  treatment  is  of  course  a
simplification  but  reasonable  because  the  most  probable  velocity  in  the  perfect  gas  is  small  due  to  low
cosmic background temperature, 2.7K. It can be in fact regarded as an outcome of the average over large
region of space. As a result, the energy-momentum tensor for the matter of the Universe is simply

everywhere in the Earth-related coordinate system,  where  p   is  the  pressure  of  the  perfect  gas.  We  take
the  system  of  units  of  c =1  here  and  after  unless  specified.  Such  a  kind  of  the  matter  of  the  Universe
produces a gravitational field that we call the gravitational field of the Universe. The gravitational field of
the Universe is also the notion of the average over large region of space.

As said, the Earth-related coordinate system is at least approximately an inertial coordinate system when
the  gravitational  field  of  the  Universe  is  turned  off.  So,  if  the  Universe  was  empty,  the  Einstein  field
equation would give us the Minkowskian metric as its solution. Setting ρ= p =0 and  S = R =1 in Eq.(9),
we find

Λ=0.

k =0.

Once again, setting ρ=0 and  S = R =1 in Eq.(8a) and using Eq.(10), we get

ρ + p =0.

It is so far so good but only one equation is left for us to determine two time-dependent factors  R  and  S .
We have to secure an appropriate mathematical or physical constraint which we can combine with the left
equation for determination of  R  and  S .

In the line element Eq.(3), ds   is  an  invariant  four-dimensional  “distance”.  In  the  case  of  no

gravitational field, according to special relativity, this  ds  shapes in

It  characterizes  the  proper  time  in  the  definition  that  the  proper  time  of  an  event  is  a  time  interval  as
measured by the clock of an observer who is at rest relative to the event. The proper time is equal to the

coordinate  time  dt   when  spatial  increments  dx r   or  velocity  dx
concept of  ds  characterizing the proper time is also applicable to the case of gravitational field, we have
such  appropriate  constraint.  As  a  perfect  gas,  the  matter  of  the  Universe  has  vanishing  velocity
everywhere in the Earth-related coordinate system. This gives out

In view of Eq.(18), there was or will be a moment, at which the line element of the Universe was
or will be the Minkowskian. That moment is  t0 . We call it the SC-moment. We are entitled to choose the
origin  of  the  Earth-related  time  coordinate  provided  we  do  not  change  its  scale.  We  choose  the  SC-
moment  as  the  origin  of  the  Earth-related  time  coordinate.  In  doing  so,  in  the  Earth-related  coordinate
system, the line element of the Universe reads

Eqs.(10), (14) and (19) form the exact solution to Einstein’s equation in the gravitational field of
the Universe. Eq.(10) specifies the cosmological constant to be zero. Eq.(14) exhibits the equation of state
for the perfect gas of the Universe. Eq.(19) is the line element for space-time of the Universe.

5. Concluding remarks

We have reconstructed, in the Earth-related coordinate system, the standard model of cosmology.
We  have  exactly  solved  Einstein’s  field  equation  involved.  From  this  exact  solution  we  draw  some
conclusions as follows.

(1) In the gravitational field of the Universe, the line element of space-time of the Universe varies
with time. It is in time-evolution. In this evolution, there was or will be the SC-moment, at which the line
element was or will be the Minkowskian. Time is running forever from the past to the future. We have to
depend on experimental observations to determine whether the SC-moment was in the past or will be in
the future.

(2) The line element of space-time of the Universe stands at all times, from  −∞  to  +∞ . We can

see no need of introducing the concept of the age of the Universe.

(3)  Eqs.(11),  (16)  and  (17)  allow  us  to  calculate  the  space-time  curvature  of  the  Universe  in

Eq.(7),

It  varies  with  time,  too.  It  is  negative  for  always  and  never  becomes  zero  unless  ρ= 0 .  It  approaches
−16πρG  eventually. The four-dimensional space-time of the Universe is curved forever though its three-
dimensional space is flat.

(4)  The  equation  of  state,  Eq.(14),  indicates  that  the  matter  of  the  Universe,  as  a  perfect  gas,

possesses a negative pressure.

(5)  It  seems  that  to  add  the  cosmological  term  to  the  original  version  [15]  of  Einstein’s  field
equation is not necessary when we apply Einstein’s theory of gravitation to the study of the gravitational
field of the Universe, as well as, to the study of the spherically symmetric gravitational field [17].

The obtained exact solution is effective in the studies of only those physical processes that occur
in large region of space because Eqs.(3) and (4) lose their validity in any localized small region of space.
A  physical  process  occurring  in  a  localized  small  region  of  space  must  be  under  control  of  some
gravitational field other than the gravitational field of the Universe or some interaction other than gravity.
We  shall  use  the  obtained  exact  solution  to  derive  the  formula  relating  the  red-shift  of  light  signals
coming from distant galaxies to the distance of these galaxies from us and the time of detecting of these
light  signals.  This  formula  will  help  us  in  understanding  the  observed  “accelerating  expansion  of  the
Universe”. We report these somewhere else [18].

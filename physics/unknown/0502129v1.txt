Abstract.  Galilean  Electromagnetism  was  discovered  thirty  years  ago  by  Levy-Leblond  &  Le  Bellac.  However, 
these authors only explored the consequences for the fields and not for the potentials. Following De Montigny & al., 
we show that the Coulomb gauge condition is the magnetic limit of the Lorenz gauge condition whereas the Lorenz 
gauge condition applies in the electric limit of Lévy-Leblond & Le Bellac. Contrary to De Montigny & al. who used 
Galilean tensor calculus, we use orders of magnitude based on physical motivations in our derivation.

1.  Introduction 
 
 
Does there exist a galilean limit of Maxwell equations ? According to Lévy-Leblond & Le 
Bellac,  the  answer  is  positive  [1].  Indeed,  they  have  shown  that  there  exist  not  one  as  in 
mechanics  but  two  well  defined  Galilean  limits  of  the  full  set  of  Maxwell  equations  :  the 
magnetic limit and the electric limit. The two Galilean limits were introduced by Lévy-Leblond 
and  Le  Bellac  without  demonstration.  More  precisely,  they  have  show  that  two  particular 
approximations  of  the  full  set  of  Maxwell  equations  were  compatible  with  the  two  Galilean 
transformations for the field they “derived”.  
If  one  denotes  γ = 1− v2 cL

  where  c L   is  the  light  velocity,  the  relativistic 
transformations for the fields in vacuum between two inertial frames with relative velocity v are :

In  vacuum,  one  obtains  the  magnetic  limit  by  stating  that  v c L << 1  and  E << c LB . 
Conversely,  the  electric  limit  is  obtained  by  stating  that  v c L << 1  and  E >> c LB .  Hence,  one 
ends up with two set of low-velocity formula from the Lorentz transformations [1]: 

′ E  = E  and 

Electric Limit : 
′ B  = B − 1 cL
Magnetic Limit : 

(

)v × E

 

′ E  = E + v × B and 

′ B  = B 

These  two  limits  are  practically  very  important  since  they  correspond  to  the  so-called 
electroquasistatic  and  magnetoquasistatic  approximations  of  engineering  electromagnetism  as 
described  in  Haus  &  Melcher  e-book  [2].  Moreover,  magnetohydrodynamics  relies  on  the 
magnetic limit whereas electrohydrodynamics relies on the electric limit of Maxwell equations. 

Severals  authors  have  discussed  recently  Lévy-Leblond  &  Le  Bellac  paper.  Holland  & 
Brown argued that the limit process applied to the scalar and vector potential would break gauge 
invariance such that they did not explore as Lévy-Leblond & Le Bellac the consequences for the 
so-called  gauge  conditions  [3].  De  Montigny  &  al.  in  a  series  of  papers  revisited  also  Galilean 
electromagnetism  with  the  help  of  a  “Galilean  tensor  calculus”  which  consists  in  expressing 
nonrelativistic equations in a covariant form with a five-dimensionnal Riemannian manifold ([4] 
and references therein). In their review on Galilean Electromagnetism, De Montigny & al. have

Lorentz  transformations  becomes  the  Coulomb  gauge  condition 
  within  the  magnetic 
limit and that the Lorenz gauge condition keeps unchanged within the electric limit. The present 
author  has  reached  independently  the  same  conclusions  [5]  by  imposing  directly  Galilean 
covariance with respect to the gauge conditions depending on the Galilean transformations for the 
potentials,  first  introduced  by  Levy-Leblond  &  Le  Bellac,  which  differ  according  to  the  two 
limits :

Here  we  would  like  to  show  a  physically  meaningful  derivation  based  on  orders  of 

magnitude of the Galilean limits for the Lorentz-covariant Lorenz gauge condition. 
 
2. The Galilean limits of Lorenz gauge condition 
 

Now, how do Lévy-Leblond and Le Bellac know that  E << c LB  or  E >> c LB . Indeed, it 

is a rather formal assumption which is not justified at all a priori whereas it is true ! 

We  argue  that  the  derivation  of  Lévy-Leblond  &  LeBellac  is  equivalent  to  evaluate  the 

order of magnitude of the following parameters : 

~
 ( ρ~ ) 
where L (τ represents the order of magnitude of a typical scale (time) of the problem and  j
represents  the  order  of  magnitude  of    the  current  (charges)  density  in  the  system  under 
examination. 

As a matter of fact, the values of the electric and magnetic fields depend on their sources, 
that  is,  on  the  distribution  of  the  charge  and  current  densities.  If  one  evaluates  the  order  of 
magnitude of the fields in function of the sources using Gauss and Ampère’s equations, one ends 
up with :

Hence,  one  has  shown  that  assuming  E >> c LB   ( E << c LB )  is  the  consequence  of 

which leads to :

In addition, Ampère’s equation leads to : 

 (

and Faraday’s equation gives :

˜ E  ≈ ˜ v ˜ B  

which are compatible only if :  ˜ v ≈ c L  (Lorentz-covariant electromagnetism). 
 

As  a  consequence,  either  we  have 

×∇

0E ≈

  (the  time 

derivative  of  the  magnetic  field  drops)  and 

  (the  electric  limit)  or  we  have

Once again, we underline forcefully that we have only shown compatibility between some 
approximations  of  the  full  set  of  “Maxwell  equations”  with  Galilean  relativity.  We  will  now 
present what we think to be a demonstration of the two Galilean limits.

Indeed, the author has recently proposed to use the so-called Riemann-Lorenz formulation 
(the potentials are the basic quantities) instead of the so-called Heaviside-Hertz formulation (the 
fields  are  the  basic  quantities)  in  order  to  describe  any  experimental  fact  relative  to  Classical 
Electromagnetism [5]. The Riemann-Lorenz procedure consists in using the following postulate : 
“Any  experimental  fact  of  Classical  Electromagnetism  can  be  explained  through  the  use  of  a 
scalar and a vector potential which are solutions of a set of Riemann equations with source terms 
(current density for the vector potential and charge density for the scalar potential) assuming that 
both potentials are constrained to fulfill the Lorenz equation. With respect to the interaction with 
the matter, the Lorentz force usually written in terms of the fields can be rewritten in terms of the 
potentials  as  the  time  derivative  of  the  sum  of  the  kinetic  momentum  plus  the  electromagnetic 
momentum  equal  to  minus  the  gradient  of  the  difference  between  the  scalar  potential  and  the 
scalar product of the velocity of the charge with the vector potential” :

The purpose of this article is not to discuss the validity of this postulate but to show what

We  explicitly  assume  that  the  potentials  are  defined  up  to  a  constant  which,  for  an  infinite 
volume, is taken to be zero. If the volume of investigation is bounded like in a Faraday cage, the 
contribution of all the sources outside the volume resumes to a constant which is different from 
zero as can be shown easily with the Green formula. 

In  the  quasi-static  approximation  where

potentials become [6] :

These  approximations  are  the  solutions  of  Poisson  equations  for  the  potentials  which  are  the

Contrary to Holland & Brown [3], we explicitly break gauge invariance of the Heaviside-
Hertz  formulation  by  giving  orders  of  magnitude  to  the  potentials.  When  one  say  that  we  can 
evaluate  the  order  of  magnitude  of  the  potentials,  one  assume  that  we  evaluate  the  order  of 
magnitude of the potentials with respect to the constant on the boundary of the domain which is 
null if infinite and without sources at infinity. Hence, the tilde means the order of magnitude of a 
difference of potentials. Indeed, only the concept of difference of potential does have a physical 
meaning  in  the  Riemann-Lorenz  formulation.  Yet,  we  point  out  forcefully  that  a  difference  of 
potential  is  not  equal  to  a  field  :  for  example,  the  static  field  inside  a  capacitor  is  equal  to  the 
difference of potential between the two plates divided by the distance between them. A volt per 
meter is not the same object as a volt…

As  one  can  see,  it  implies  the  same  ratio  between  ε  and  ξ.  Now,  according  to  Lévy-

Hence,  the  Coulomb  gauge

magnetic limit and is now Galilean covariant with respect to the magnetic transformations of the 
potentials. The same conclusion applies for the charge conservation.

Using  the  Poisson  equations  for  the  potentials  and  either  the  Lorenz  or  the  Coulomb 
gauge  depending  on  the  electric  or  the  magnetic  limit,  one  can  easily  derive  the  two  sets  of 
Galilean  Maxwell  equation  for  the  fields  proposed  by  Lévy-Leblond  &  Le  Bellac  [1].  The 
important point is to recognize that the two Galilean sets of equations in terms of the fields were 
stated  without  demonstration  in  [1]  whereas  here,  we  can  demonstrate  them  starting  with  the 
potentials. 

 

3. Conclusion 
 

As  a  conclusion,  we  have  shown  that  the  Lorenz  equation  applies  in  both  Lorentz-
covariant  relativity  as  well  as  Galilean  covariant  electric  limit  of  Lévy-Leblond  and  Le  Bellac 
whereas the Coulomb gauge equation applies only within the Galilean covariant magnetic limit. 
We have explicitly broken gauge invariance in order to get these results in accordance with the 
Riemann-Lorenz formulation of Classical Electromagnetism. This last fact is a priori astonishing 
and  contradictory  but  it  was  demontrated  long  ago  that  Galilean  Covariance  and  Gauge 
Invariance  were  incompatible  [6].  Galilean  Electromagnetism  is  an  unexpected  field  of  actual 
research as one needs to explore all its consequence in our current understanding of the special 
theory of relativity. As recalled recently by J. Norton, this theory emerged from Albert Einstein’s 

struggle with Lorentz’s pre-1905 electromagnetic theory, which is a mixing of the magnetic and 
electric limit without the essential property of group additivity and which made it untenable [7]…

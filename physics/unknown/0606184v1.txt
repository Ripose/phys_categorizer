Abstract 

In  this  paper,  the  right  expressions  of  the  fully  nonrelativistic  K-shell 
 
Rayleigh  scattering  amplitudes  and  cross-sections  are  obtained  by  using  the 
Coulomb Green function method. Our analytical result has no spurious poles as 
the old nonrelativistic result with retardation [M. Gavrila and A.Costescu  Phys. 
Rev. A 2, 1752 (1970)] presents.  
 
Taking  into  account  the  exact  expression  of  the  second  order  S-matrix 
element in the case of the elastic scattering of photons by K-shell bound electrons 
mZα , for 
we obtain its nonrelativistic limit (valid for photon energies ω up to  
intermediate Z), by removing in a consistent and appropriate way the higher order 
terms in  Zα and  m/ω . 
We  obtain  the  imaginary  part  of  the  Rayleigh  amplitudes  in  terms  of 
 
elementary  functions.  Thereby  the  exact  nonrelativistic  total  photoeffect  cross-
section is obtained via the optical theorem. 
 
Comparing  the predictions given  by our formulae  with  the  full  relativistic 
numerical calculations of Kissel et al [Phys. Rev. A 22, 1970 (1980)], and with 
experimental results, a fairly good agreement within 10% is found for the angular 
mZα ,  for 
distribution  of  Rayleigh  scattering  for  photon  energies  up  to 
intermediate  Z,  and  up  to  twice  the  photoeffect  threshold  energy  for  high  Z 
elements. Considering the right relativistic location for the photoeffect threshold 
very good predictions are found below the first resonance, even in its vicinity. 
 
We present our numerical results for Rayleigh angular distribution and the 
photoeffect total cross-section, for various photon energies, scattering angles and 
Z, compared with other theoretical and experimental results.  
 

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
 
As it was previously shown by Costescu et al [3], in the case of the photon elastic scattering 
from K-Shell electrons, the well-known nonrelativistic Kramers-Heisenberg-Waller (KHW) matrix 
,  far  enough  from  the  K-shell  photo-effect 
m2=ω
element  presents  spurious  poles  located  at
threshold thω .

It  is  obvious  that  when  the  photon  energy ω is  greater  than  100  keV  the  KHW  result 
strongly overestimates the Rayleigh cross-section, because the spurious poles
 are 
at  least  of  the  4th  order  in  the  amplitude  i.e.  of  the  8th  order  in  the  cross-section,  as  well  as  the 
photoeffect cross-section. We notice that for low and intermediate Z values and photon energies up 
to three times the photoeffect threshold energy, the modulus
 of the denominator is close to

. In the next section we prove that 

the value ωm2
 is the right nonrelativistic limit of 
the denominator that explains why the nonrelativistic result obtained by Gavrila and Costescu [1] in 
KHW approach making use of the coulombian Green function of Schwinger [5] gives fairly good 
predictions  above  the  photoeffect  threshold  up  to  20-25  keV  for  low  and  up  to  90-100  keV  for 
intermediate Z values [3], [6]. 
 
Recently,  it  has  been  proven  [7]  that  in  the  case  of  Compton  scattering  on  K-shell  bound 
electrons  the  nonrelativistic  KHW  matrix  element  leads  to  inadequate  expressions  for  the 
nonrelativistic  Compton  amplitudes  when  the  sum  over  the  complete  set  of  positive-energy 
intermediate  states  is  removed  by  using  the  nonrelativistic  coulombian  Green  function  and  its 
integral  representation.  Indeed,  in  this  way  the  nonrelativistic  kinematics  would  be  taken  into 
account  from  the  very  beginning  of  the  analytical  calculation,  so  that  important  relativistic 
kinematics terms in
, which would in fact exactly cancel some terms due to multipoles, should be 
omitted.  This  is  why  the  spurious  kinematics  poles  occur  in  the  KHW  amplitudes  for  any  two 
photon process. 
The right way to obtain the nonrelativistic amplitudes for a two photon atomic process is to 
 
consider the second order S-matrix element involving the sum over the complete set of intermediate 
states  n  (solutions of Dirac equation with Coulomb field) of energies 
, corresponding to both 
positive and negative energy states and replacing this sum with the coulombian Green function of 
Dirac equation given by Hostler and Pratt [8,9]. In this way the relativistic kinematics is taken into 
account  when  performing  the  integrals  involved  in  the  matrix  element.  Only  after  performing  all 
needed  integrals  the  nonrelativistic  limit  of  the  second  order  S-matrix  elements  should  be 
considered and the right nonrelativistic amplitudes are obtained without any spurious singularity. 
 
In the specific case of the elastic scattering of photons from K-shell bound electrons, both 
final and initial states are described by Dirac spinors which have significant values only in a region 
located near the nucleus at a distance of the order of the ion Bohr radius 
0 =0.53 Ǻ. 
This shows that small distances contribute to the matrix element much more in the case of Rayleigh 
scattering  than  in  the  case  of  Compton  scattering  where  the  final  state  belong  to  continuum 
spectrum  and  the  overlapping  at  small  distances  with  the  ground  state  Dirac  spinors  is  less 
important.  As  a  consequence,  the  validity  of  the  nonrelativistic  result  has  to  come  to  an  end  at 
significantly  smaller  energies  in  the  case  of  Rayleigh  scattering  than  in  the  case  of  Compton 
scattering. 
In  the  next  section  we  present  our  analytical  calculations  in  order  to  get  the  right 
 
nonrelativistic  limit  of  the  S-matrix  element  (NRLSM)  for  Rayleigh  scattering  on  ground  state 
electrons. 
 
We  also  present  numerical  comparisons  with  relativistic  S-matrix  calculations  [2]  that 
confirm  the  validity  of  our  NRLSM  over  a  significantly  larger  energy  range  than  the  old 
nonrelativistic  result  of  Gavrila  and  Costescu  (NRGC)  [1],  the  NRLSM  being  valid  above  the 
photoeffect threshold for photon energies up to 200 keV both for intermediate and high Z elements.  
Accordingly,  the  nonrelativistic  limit  of  the  imaginary  part  of  the  Rayleigh  amplitudes  is 
 
correctly obtained, particularly the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude, allowing to 
get  the  exact  expression  for  the  total  photoelectric  K-shell  cross-section,  as  it  no  longer  contains 
spurious singularities.

The  aim  of  the  present  paper  is  to  obtain  the  right  angular  distribution  of  the  Rayleygh 
scattering  cross-section  on  bound  electrons  in  the  nonrelativistic  limit,  without  spurious 
singularities, and to evaluate the domain of it’s validity.  
 
In the literature is known the numerical full relativistic (RMP) calculations of Kissel et al 
[2] for the Rayleigh scattering cross-section on bound electrons, which makes the direct numerical 
calculations starting from the S-matrix second-order element. These results allow us to compare our

predictions with the full relativistic ones. Also, below the first resonance we compare our results 
with the relativistic dipole approximation for forward Rayleigh scattering of Florescu et al [10].

The eqs. (2.10-2.15) are similar to those that appear in the case of Compton scattering [7] 
 
unless the final state Dirac spinor, which in the Rayleigh case corresponds to the ground state2.  In 
the case of Rayleigh scattering it was shown [3,6] that for low and intermediate Z values and for 
photon energies up to several times the photoeffect threshold the nonrelativistic approach including 
multipoles  and  retardation  gives  excellent  predictions.  That  suggests  that  above  the  photoeffect 
threshold,  in  a  large  range  of  energies,  the  first  iteration  term  to  the  main  term  G0  should  be

2 The different sign in the right side of the eq. (2.12) is due to the different sign convention for the function 

. The coefficient ½ in the right side of eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) of the reference [7], generated by an edit

significantly smaller than the main term itself. We can expect that this is also true for heavy atoms 
for  photon  energies ω up  to  twice  the  photoeffect  threshold.  Comparing  the  numerical  results 
obtained when the spurious poles are no longer present with the full relativistic numerical results of 
Kissel et al [2] we can check the validity of this presumption. In the following we neglect the first 
iterative term G0, as well as the “small” components of both ground state Dirac spinors. We discuss 
in more detail this last approximation in the Appendix A. We want to state that neglecting small 
components is a consistent approach in the nonrelativistic region.

Because  the  location  of  the  photoeffect  threshold 

thω  and  of  all  physical  resonances  is 
correctly  given  only  by  Dirac  equation,  we  consider  the  exact  relativistic  value  of  the  K-shell 
threshold.  This  allows  us  a  consistent  comparison  (especially  for  high  Z  values),  between  the  S-
matrix  nonrelativistic  limit  predictions  and  the  fully  relativistic  ones,  both  above  and  below 
threshold. Indeed, for high Z elements, there is a difference of about 10% between the relativistic 
and nonrelativistic threshold energies that would induce a systematic and important discrepancy in 
any  predictions  of  the  nonrelativistic  approach.  We  consider  that  the  consistency  of  the 
nonrelativistic  approach  is  not  be  affected  by  the  choosing  of  the  right  experimental  value  of  the 
threshold energy and the position of the physical resonances.

We  point  out  that  the  presence  of    the  relativistic  ground  state  energy 

 
 in  the  above 
 
expressions is needed because we used the relativistic photoelectric threshold and also it gives the 
ω  for  which  the  denominator  vanishes.  The  accuracy  of 
correct  value  of  the  photon  energy 
choosing the exact photoelectric threshold value is particularly important here, as the function 
0χ  
appears in an exponential.

The  predictions  given  by  formula  (3.8),  presented  in  the  next  chapter,  show  a  very  good 
agreement with full relativistic numerical calculations of Kissell et. al. [2], Mayers and Brown [12], 
Scofield  [13],  Hultberg  et.  al.  [14],  for  any  atomic  number  Z  and  photon  energies  at  least  up  to 

 

13

twice  the  photoeffect  threshold.  We  notice  that  the  formula  (3.8)  gives  significantly  better 
predictions than the relativistic Sauter formula [15], due to the presence of the exponential 
. 
 
We consider that our formula (3.8), which obviously has no spurious singularities is more 
 
accurate than Fischer’s formula for the nonrelativistic photoeffect from K-shell bound electrons and 
it also works at larger energies and Z values. 
 
 
 
 
 
In the tables I-VIII we present our angular distribution predictions for Rayleigh scattering 
by a K-shell electron of the elements with Z=30, Z=47, Z=82 and Z=92, for several photon energies

The good agreement of our calculation with the full relativistic results shows that, for the 
presented energies regime, the main relativistic kinematics terms are cancelled by retardation and 
multipoles terms, and the remaining terms have a nonrelativistic origin.  Also, the spin effects are 
small but they settle on the right locations and number of physical resonances. For high Z values, 
even in the nonrelativistic limit where the nonrelativistic terms are largely dominant, all resonances 
and threshold energies values must be considered in accordance with their experimental values.

1=γ  is  fairly 
From  the  integral  representations  A.3  and  A.4  we  observe  that  the  approximation 
good  since  the  largest  contribution  to  the  integral  is  given  by  the  vicinity  of  the  origin.  This  is

 only for higher values of x.  This means that the domain of 
with the constant term  
values of x which give relevant contributions to the integral must be extended beyond the vicinity 
of the origin and the nonrelativistic approach is no longer valid. This conclusion is in accordance 
 the 
with the fact that in the case of large photon energies and large momentum transfer 
contribution  to  the  Rayleigh  amplitude  is  mainly  due  to  the  small  values  of  r  in  the  coulombian 
spinor, thus the term

All  these  statements  may  be  sustained  when  we  get  the  nonrelativistic  expression  of  the 
NRϑ  (eq. 2.19). Indeed, if we calculate the relativistic form-factor given by eq. (2.17), 

 must be exactly considered.

The  relativistic  parameter

 is  present  in  the  denominator  exponent  due  to 
Zα
.  The 
the  behavior  near  the  origin  of  the  coulombian  Dirac  spinor  given  by  the  factor 
nonrelativistic  limit  is  simply  obtained  by  taking 
1=γ ,  which  leads  to  a  subevaluation  of  the 
contribution  of  the  small  distances  to  the  Rayleigh  matrix  element.  This  underestimation  of  the 
matrix element is not important in the case of not too large momentum transfer. In the momentum 
representation,  the  eqs.  (A.2)  and  (A.3)  obviously  show  the  same  behavior:  if  we  put 
1=γ ,  the 
small  component  vanishes,  while  the  large  component  turns  into  the  nonrelativistic  ground-state 
eigenfunction. Thus, if we put 
1=γ  in eq. (A.8), we get the nonrelativistic expression of the atomic 
form factor, eq. (2.19):

(A.12) 

The  neglect  of  the  first  iteration  may  be  justified  with  the  same  arguments  as  in  the  case  of  the 
small  components  of  the  Dirac  spinor.  Moreover,  as  Hostler  has  shown,  (  [9  ]  eq.  3.16  and  the 
comments  below)  that  a  consistent  calculation  requires  that  the  first  iteration  to  the  coulombian 
Green  function  and  the  small  components  of  the  Dirac  spinor  have  to  be  either  taken  into 
consideration or neglected together.

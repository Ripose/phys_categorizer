The  seamless  transition  between  micro-scale  photonics  and  nano-scale  plasmonics  requires  the 

mitigation between different waveguiding mechanisms as well as between few orders of magnitude in 

the field lateral size, down to a small fraction of a wavelength.  By exploiting gap plasmon polariton 

waves both at the micro and nano scale, very high power transfer efficiency (>60%) can be achieved 

using  an  ultrashort  (few  microns)  non  adiabatic  tapered  gap  plasmon  waveguide.  Same  mechanism 

may be used to harvest impinging light waves and direct them into a nano hole or slit, to exhibit an 

anomalous  transmission  -  without  the  conventional  periodic  structures.  The  special  interplay  of 

plasmonic and oscillating modes is analyzed.

Nano-Photonics  has  gained  much  interest  in  recent  years,  with  newly  developed  nano-

fabrication  techniques  allowing  the  realization  of  sub-micron  optical  devices,  such  as  high-

index-contrast  channel  waveguides,  and  Photonic-Crystal  waveguides  (cid:1)[1],(cid:1)[2].  Yet,  the 

micron-scale  wavelength  of  light  limits  the  miniaturization  of  optical  devices.  Surface 

Plasmon Polariton (SPP) optical waves on a metal-dielectric interface can be confined much 

below  the  optical  wavelength  (cid:1)[3],  and  offer  a  route  to  overcome  the  diffraction-limit. 

Research of sub-wavelength SPP optics shows promise for the realization of nanometer-size 

Photonic Integrated Circuits, for applications such as optical interconnects, signal processing 

and  nano-sensing  (cid:1)[4].  Metal  stripes  tens  of  nanometer  thick,  surrounded  by  a  dielectric 

cladding,  can  potentially  serve  as  low  loss  SPP  waveguides,  as  was  shown  theoretically 

(cid:1)[5],(cid:1)[6] and experimentally (cid:1)[7],(cid:1)[8] 

A major concern of basic interest and for practical implementation of plasmonic circuits, 

is  achieving  efficient  interfacing  between  conventional  micron-size  photonic waveguides  to 

tens-of-nm-size  plasmon  carrying  waveguides.  A  closely  related  field  of  interest  is  the 

efficient  transmission  of  light  through  nano-holes  and  slits  in  metal  layers  [9],  where  the 

micron-scale  wavelength  impinging  field  is  harvested  employing  a  periodic  structure,  and 

then transmitted through the nano hole [10],[11]. Current schemes for coupling of light to a 

gold  stripe  plasmon  waveguide  encompasses end-fire  excitation from  a  single-mode  optical 

fiber  (cid:1)[7],(cid:1)[8],  and  side  coupling  between  SOI  waveguides  and  silver  plasmon  waveguides 

[12]. While a significant portion of previous research was focused on slab and stripe plasmon 

waveguides consisting of a metal core with a dielectric cladding ([4]-[8] and ref. therein), we 

studied  a  plasmon  waveguide  with  the  inverted  structure  of  a  dielectric  core  with  a  metal 

cladding [13], coined Plasmon Gap Waveguide (PGW) [14]. The PGW provides tight optical 

confinement by the metallic cladding, and should be better coupled to a dielectric waveguide 

due  to  the  continuity  of  the  waveguide  core,  as  well  as  to  regular  plasmon  waveguides  by 

proper plasmonic coupling schemes.  

In this letter we investigate and analyze the interplay and coupling of modes in a tapered 

PGW  structure.  A  very  short  taper  exhibits  surprisingly  high  efficiency  plasmon  assisted 

coupling from a micron-size Silica/Air-clad dielectric waveguide to a 50nm Silica/Gold-clad 

Plasmon Gap Waveguide. Power transfer efficiency of more than 70% is exhibited. Some of 

the fundamental findings described here are:  the cut-off of a dielectric waveguide mode after 

which  it  changes  into  a  plasmon  surface  wave  in  PGW;  an  interpretation  for  the  lack  of 

adiabaticity  constraints  for  efficient  PGW  tapers;  and  a  novel  highly  efficient  method  for 

harvesting light into nano slits – not using a periodic structure – namely funnel shape metal 

interfaces, that can be used to transmit "more than 100%" via nano holes. 

The dispersion relations of Plasmon Gap Waveguides, consisting of a dielectric core with 

a metal cladding were discussed in different contexts by Economou [15], and Kaminow et. al. 

[16]. Prade et. al. [17] analyzed theoretically a loss-less waveguide with a dielectric core and 

a cladding with a negative real dielectric constant. The guided modes can be either Plasmon 

modes, of exponential nature, or Oscillating modes with a trigonometric behavior similar to 

modes  of  a  dielectric  waveguide.  Recent  works  have  analyzed  the  trade-off  between 

confinement and propagation losses in a PGW [18], including the effects of empirical metal 

data [19]. We would like to emphasize an important difference between the plasmonic modes 

of  slab  and  gap  structures.  While  for  a  gap  structure  plasmonic  modes  exist  both  for 

nanoscale  and  microscale  waveguide  dimension,  an  essential  characteristic  for  the  desired 

seamless transition, this has no counterpart in a metal slab plasmon waveguide. As the fields 

quickly decay in the metal core for slab thickness larger than the skin depth (~100nm for the 

materials  and  wavelength  considered  here),  slab  plasmon  modes  split  into  single  interface 

SPP modes. 

The PGW we have analyzed consists of a planar Silica slab of width  2 d(cid:1)

 along the X-

axis surrounded on both sides by a semi-infinite Gold cladding, with the waves propagating 

along the Z axis. We chose the telecom wavelength of 1.55(cid:2)m, which has the advantage of 

exhibiting lower metal losses than in the visible. The values used for the dielectric constants 

were:

  [20],  with  the  complex  dielectric

modes,  but  we  will focus on  TM-polarized modes, for  which  plasmon  modes exist as  well,

The solution of the complex dispersion relations yields  R(cid:5)  and  R(cid:5)  vs. the gap width (which 

we intend to linearly  vary), plotted in Figs. 1a and 1b respectively. In Fig. 1a, the Plasmon

Two  plasmon  mode  solutions  exist:  a  symmetric  mode  for  any  gap  width,  and  an  anti-

symmetric  mode  that  has  a  cut-off  for  gap  widths  below 

0~

/ 2 dn(cid:8)

,  making  the  symmetric 

plasmon mode a single-mode of the structure in the nano regime. Odd and Even oscillating 

modes exist as well in the gap plasmon waveguide, each has a cut-off width, below which it 

becomes  evanescent  with  very  high  losses,  as  seen  in  Fig.  1b.  An  interesting  feature  found 

here  is  that  the  first  anti-symmetric  plasmon  mode,  TM1,  for  a  gap  width  below  its  cut-off 

value, transforms into the first Odd Oscillating mode. Thus this oscillating mode exhibits two 

cutoff values, from below – into an evanescent mode and from above – into plasmon mode. 

As  no  additional  plasmon  modes  exist  below 

(cid:5)

R Plas d
(

(cid:3) (cid:9) ,  the  single-surface  plasmon-

)

polariton  propagation  constant,  all  the  other  Oscillating  modes  approach  the  light-line 

asymptotically, but do not cross it. 

The first stage of harvesting the light from the micro-scale Silica/Air dielectric waveguide 

calls  for  an  efficient  conversion  of  the  optical  mode  to  a  plasmonic  mode  of  interest, 

supported  by  a  PGW  (Fig.  2a).  Due  to  the  symmetry  of  the  structure  and  excitation,  the 

modes  excited  at  the  PGW  will  be  symmetrical  as  well,  i.e.  the  relevant  modes  for  our 

analysis are the symmetrical Plasmon mode TM0, and the lowest order even Oscillating mode 

TM2  .The  modes  at  the  input  plane  of  the  PGW  are  plotted  in  Figs.  2b-2d  -  Plasmon, 

Oscillating, and dielectric input waveguide modes respectively. 

We  analyzed  in  detail  and  closed  form  the  transmission  and  reflection  at  the  interface 

between the dielectric and plasmon waveguides, where the incoming mode of the dielectric 

waveguide  couples  into  both  plasmon  and  oscillating  modes  of  the  PGW,  as  well  as  back 

reflected and couples to guided and radiation modes of the dielectric slab. The width of the 

dielectric waveguide was scanned in the range of 1.05 to 1.5 (cid:2)m, limited from below by the 

cut-off of the PGW TM2 mode (we intentionally analyzed the non ideal case where light can 

partially couple also to unwanted modes). It is evident from Fig. 3a that at a waveguide width 

of 1.25(cid:2)m almost no energy is back reflected in the photonic-plasmonic conversion process, 

and as much as 85% of the incident photonic power is converted to the plasmon mode of the 

PGW, while 15% is coupled to the Oscillating mode. 

The second stage of harvesting is the collection of the power converted to the plasmonic 

mode,  and  guiding  it  with  minimal  losses  into  the  nano  waveguide,  50nm  wide  in  our 

example.  A  linearly  tapered  structure  is  employed  to  perform  this  task.  The  width  change 

along the Z-axis facilitates also some coupling between the plasmon and oscillating mode in 

the  PWG.  In  our  analysis  we  dwell  with  this  inter-mode  coupling,  and  optimize  the  taper 

angle as to maximize plasmon mode transmission to the 50nm narrow end. 

The linearly tapered PGW was discretisized to a sequence of short straight segments with 

varying width, and we employed a Transfer Matrix formalism to calculate the amplitudes of 

the  forward  and  backward  modes  at  each  segment.  Modes  coupling  coefficients  were 

calculated by overlap integrals of the form:

where (cid:2)i

L is the electric field of mode i in the Left segment, and hj

R is the magnetic field of 

mode j in the right segment, and i, j are plasmon / oscillating  forward / backward modes. We 

did not assume orthogonality of the modes at each segment, and coupling coefficients within 

the segment C i,j 

L,L , C i,j 

R,R were calculated and not assumed to be zero. This scheme fits well 

lossy geometries and also stabilizes the numerical scheme. Assuming mode orthogonally, the 

zero  elements  of  the  matrices  accumulate  numerical  noise  and  grow  over  long  propagation 

distances  while for nonorthogonity  these close-to-zero  orthogonal matrix elements  stay  ~12 

orders of magnitude below the significant amplitudes. 

The  coupling  of  plasmon  and  Oscillating  modes  along  the  tapered  waveguide  was 

calculated  and  is  exhibited  by  the  power  oscillation  of  the  modes  (Fig.  3b).  The  optimal 

design, obtained for a taper angle of 5.5 degrees (Fig 4), is a result of a tradeoff between the 

point  of  maximal  coupling  and  higher  propagation  losses  originating  from  longer  taper 

lengths.  As  shown  in  Fig.  3b,  the  cutoff  point  of  the  oscillating  mode  is  achieved 

approximately where the coupled power is maximal at the plasmonic mode. This taper angle 

results in a very short 6(cid:2)m and very nonadiabatic funnel, an order of magnitude shorter than 

the  common  wisdom  in  regular  photonics  circuits.  The  two  fundamental  reasons  for  not 

requiring adiabaticity from plasmonic gap tapers are the dominance of propagation loss and 

the  fact that  there  are  no  other  forward  propagation modes  to  couple  to, neither  guided  nor 

radiation.  This  is  in  contrast  to  a  dielectric  taper,  where  the  primary  mechanism  of  non 

adiabatic taper loss is the coupling to forward propagation radiation modes. The evolution of 

the  single-mode  plasmon  mode  beyond  the  cut-off  of  the  Oscillating  mode  exhibits  very 

small coupling to the backward plasmon mode, as can be seen in Fig. 3b. More than 70% of 

the  power  incident  from  the  dielectric  waveguide  is  coupled  eventually  into  the  plasmon 

mode  of  the  50nm  wide  PGW.  To  verify  this  result,  finite  difference  time  domain  (FDTD) 

simulations  of  the  tapered  PGW  coupler  were  performed  and  confirmed  the  results  of  the 

transfer matrices analysis, exhibiting a high coupling efficiency of ~60%. Switching the input 

field  from  TM  to  TE  results  in  an  almost  complete  shut-down  of  the  transmission  with  all 

energy  reflected  back,  as  seen  in  Fig.  5.  This  validates  that  the  high  coupling  efficiency  is 

achieved through coupling to Plasmon surface waves.  

This high harvesting efficiency from a micron-scale input field into a 50nm plasmon gap 

can also be used for anomalous transmission experiments through nano-sized holes or slits in 

thin metal films, similar to those describes in [9], [10]. In the latter, harvesting enhancement 

is achieved by a periodic array of grooves surrounding the slit, used to couple the impinging 

field  into  surface  plasmon  polariton.  The  method  described  in  our  letter  of  using  a  funnel 

structure offers roughly an order-of-magnitude improvement over the theoretical calculations 

of periodic arrays, while not requiring operating at a resonance wavelength of the structure. 

In  addition,  for  input  fields  with  lateral  beam  dimensions  of  about  micron,  the  periodic 

structure  is  almost  inapplicable  as  the  number  of  periods  in  the  beam  cross  section  is 

vanishingly small.  

In  Summary,  the  analysis  predicts  a  coupling  loss  of  less  than  2dB  from  a  micron-size 

dielectric waveguide, to a 50nm wide plasmon gap waveguide, by using an ultra short (6 (cid:14)m) 

optimized tapered plasmon waveguide coupler. Thus it offers a promising method to couple 

micro-optics  circuits  to  nano  plasmon-optics  devices,  and  a  step  towards  large  scale 

integrated photonic circuits.

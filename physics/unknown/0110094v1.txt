I. INTRODUCTION 

Newton’s inverse square law, F = Gm1m2/r2 – a cornerstone of classical 
 
gravitation –, giving the attraction force between two masses m1 and m2 set a distance r 
apart, stands isolated in the larger edifice of physics. Its situation is essentially reflected 
by the absence of any experimentally verified equation relating the gravitational 
constant G to other fundamental physical constants. This is so partly because large 
uncertainties in the determination of G [1, 2], unparalleled by those of any other 
physical constant, preclude an accurate check of any potentially correct theory. At 
times, such uncertainties made room for interpretations that spurred searches for new 
physics, or cast doubts [3, 4], which now appear as unfounded though [5, 6], on the 
validity of Newton’s inverse square law at terrestrial scales or on Einstein’s equivalence 
principle. To help explain a plethora of otherwise poorly understood phenomena, 
particularly at astronomical scales [7], suggestions have been made for modifications of 
gravity at low accelerations [8] and/or large distances [9]. A majority’s view, however, 
is that our accounting of the matter in the universe is incomplete [10] and that, if given 
the right input (i.e., including all forms of matter, luminous as well as dark), the 
classical (and Einsteinian) gravity theory should be able to produce the right results. 
Recently [11], a new phenomenon has been discovered that adds to the constellation of 
gravity’s enigmas: an anomalous radial deceleration experienced by the Pioneer 10/11 
spacecraft, which is at odds with the results of radio and laser ranging to the inner 
planets and the moon, and has received no satisfactory explanation to date [12]. 

 
In the quest for the true value of the gravitational constant and for the all-
encompassing theory of gravity, a route seems to have been insufficiently explored: the 
possibility that the infamous instability of Newton’s G constant may in fact be not 
purely random, but it may, at least in part, arise from some systematic variation of the 
gravitational force, which, if unaccounted for, may be erroneously interpreted as a 
change in G. In this report, an analysis of modern-times literature data on G is 
presented, from which a rate of variation for the gravitational force is extracted that 
formally appears as a large ‘G dot per G’ effect. The effect is significant and requires 
proper interpretation. A conceptual model is therefore proposed that allows for such a 
dramatic effect to occur while not contradicting the traditional gravity tests and the tight 
limits they put on any variation in G [5, 13-15]. Then, important modifications induced 
by this secular effect upon Newtonian dynamics are worked out in detail, and their 
predictions are compared to available experimental data [12], and placed in a wider 
context of observational physics at astronomical scales [16]. 

II. DATA SELECTION AND ANALYSIS 

Available G data from the twentieth century small-scale experiments carrying 

 
errors of 0.2% or less (which amounts to rounding up the fourth digit by ± 1 unit) were 
used as primary data source for this analysis. This error criterion was rather “esthetical” 
because those data carrying large standard errors would be anyway weighted out in the 
fitting process. Much of the initial guidance to early papers was offered by the 
invaluable reviewing work of G.T. Gillies [17, 18] and by the useful discussions in the 
papers of Cohen and Taylor [19] and Long [4]. Sustained effort has been directed 
toward gaining access to most of the original papers, or to other citing papers that gave 

 

3 

more detailed account of a particular work. I have also conducted my own searches to 
identify new results, particularly those that have been published after Gillies’ reviews. 
Overall, there has been published an impressive number of papers on the determination 
of the gravitational constant, including those dealing with technical issues. However, 
not all of the investigated reports did eventually contribute a G value to the analysis in 
this paper, either because of not complying with our imposed accuracy limit of 0.2% or 
because, in some cases, results of the same experiments were reported in several places 
as the data analysis progressed. In addition, some papers have only served to signal 
systematics that went previously undetected in a particular experiment, or just gave 
more precise indication on the date at which an experiment was carried out. Also 
removed from this analysis were the results from marine and geophysical surveys, and 
mine measurements, mostly because they are more prone to large systematic errors, due 
to limited knowledge of densities, borders, etc., and partly because I believe it was 
important to keep with relatively small size scale. However, this exclusion only 
sacrificed a few very good papers based on geophysical measurements [20]. 

 
Error assignment was done as follows. For a vast majority of the literature G 
values, the errors are those reported by the original papers, and were either statistical 
errors or evaluated systematic errors. Where the outcomes of series of experiments were 
all reported in a single paper together with their date of measurement (notably, a paper 
by Karagioz et al [21]), I have calculated an annual mean and the standard deviation 
based on the reported data, in order to avoid an overweighting of the present results by 
the data from a single research group. From all of the papers analyzed I have obtained a 
total of 40 values for G, collected in Table I [22], which met the requirements 
mentioned above. 

The dates at which the experiments were carried out and their corresponding 

 
uncertainties were based on information furnished by the authors (for 21 data sets) or, if 
such information was lacking, the dates were computed as follows: Where a paper was 
directly available, but no precise time-related information was provided (9 data sets), 
the time ± its uncertainty were taken as [(received date – 0.5) ± 0.5] year. For results 
published in less popular journals as well as for older reports that were not directly 
available to me and for which no time-related information was provided by the citing 
article (7 cases), the time ± error were computed as [(publication date – 1) ± 1] year. 
For three other older experiments, summarized by the rows 1, 2 and 4 of Table I [22], 
comprehensive information was available from the citing paper. 

There has been a wealth of data concentrated over the past decade. Most of these 

 
many researches have been apparently stimulated by some contradicting results 
published in the first half of the nineteen nineties, and especially by the surprisingly 
high G value [(6.71540 ± 0.000083) × 10-11 m3 kg-1 s-2] reported by Michaelis et al in 
1995 [23] (see also Refs. [1, 18] for comparison and discussions). The main analysis in 
the present work does not include Michaelis’ value. Support for this exclusion comes 
from a recent paper by Quinn et al [24], who unveiled an important source of errors that 
my have affected Michaelis et al’s work. In any case, it will be immediately seen that, 
had it been included in our analysis below, the large G value obtained by Michaelis et al 
would have exaggeratedly enhanced the effect discussed in the present paper.

There only remains for us here to explore the possibility that, while not actually 
reflecting a true increase in G, the observed secular increase of the gravitational force is 
the expression of some other real physical phenomenon whose existence should not 

 

5 

contradict a large body of knowledge, and which should also have other testable 
consequences. 

III. WAY OUT OF THE DILEMMA 

As some people have already discussed in the wider context of dark matter in 

 
Of the several possibilities of re-interpreting the observed increase in the 
gravitational force, a most productive one would be, as we shall see, to assume a secular 
increase of the masses involved in Newton’s gravity law. The idea of mass and/or 
gravitational constant variation has been a recurring subject in physics, particularly 
since the proposal of the Dirac’s large number hypothesis [26]. However, no theory so 
far has conceived such large variations in any of its parameters, as we have to consider 
here. Therefore, checking out how a large secular mass variation would affect various 
branches of science would be a very serious enterprise for anyone to undertake. Within 
the inherent size and scope constraints of this paper, however, I shall assume the more 
modest duty to envisage a scenario that leads to a parametric formula for the secular 
mass increase, whose rate (i.e., the model parameter) can be inferred from fitting the 
Newton’s law to the gravitational data above, and whose validation can be subsequently 
done by checking some of its implications for the dynamics of ponderable bodies 
against available experimental data. 
 
galaxies [7], our Sun may carry with it a (spherical) halo of cold dark matter 
– constituted of, e.g., heavy neutrinos – which could extend out to several light years 
[27, 28], and would make the Sun to behave as an extended particle. Experimental 
observations put limits of the order of 10-6 solar masses on the amount of dark matter 
contained within the orbits of outer planets [28, 29]. Inspired by such ideas, I developed 
a conceptual model based on the following postulates: 
 
halos of cold dark matter. 
(2) The diameters of the halos depend on the particle mass and size (exact form 
 
of this dependency is unimportant to us here) in such a manner that small objects, such 
as those involved in the gravitational measurements analyzed in this paper, have 
negligible halo size or no halo, viz., the dark matter condenses within the immediate 
vicinity of the object’s microstructural components. At the other extreme we have the 
Sun’s halo bathing all of the solar system objects, and extending with a nearly constant 
density to light years away from the Sun. 
(3) An object moving through the Sun’s halo impacts the halo dark matter from 
 
which it captures small amounts of matter in direct proportion to the body mass and to 
its speed relative to background halo. (The necessity for this assumption of speed 
dependency will become apparent later in Section IV and will be briefly restated in 
Section V.) 
 
halo size, while causing little or no change to the halo density. 

(4) Any addition of mass is redistributed such that it results in an increase in the 

(1) All objects within the solar system (and possibly in the Universe) present 

Based on these postulates, we can derive a formula for the secular mass increase 

 
of (extended) objects traveling through the Sun halo. To simplify maters and help 
emphasize the non-relativistic, yet, non-Newtonian character of the present phenomena, 
retardation effects due to noninstantaneous field propagation are ignored. A more 
general treatment will be attempted elsewhere. 

6 

 

 
It seems quite reasonable to assume that, in addition to its dependence on m and 
v (postulate 3), the amount of captured mass dm depends on the time of travel within the 
halo; thus, 

d

where λ is a proportionality factor. If the density of the halo changes with time (due, for 
example, to possible modifications of the Sun halo density), λ will be function of time 
too. However, to further simplify our problem, we claim here the applicability of 
postulate (4) to the case of the Sun moving through the Galaxy and take λ as a constant. 
Upon integrating the mass equation with respect to time, one obtains:

In terms of the mean speed vm over the time interval ∆t, Eq. (3) reads: 

Obviously, if Eq. (4) applies to the Earth orbiting the Sun with almost constant 

 
speed vm, any object on the Earth surface should experience secular mass increase at 
nearly the same rate as the Earth itself. Thus, if one tries to measure the gravitational 
attraction between two small objects placed on the Earth and assuming that their 
accreted dark matter is concentrated inside the object or in its immediate neighborhood 
(postulate 2), one will detect a temporal variation in the gravitational attraction between 
the two bodies following the secular mass increase. According to Eq. (4), the force

Earth), a value of (6.85 ± 1.19) × 10-18 m-1 is obtained for the constant λ. It is this short

span of the available gravitational data is rather limited.

IV. SOME CONSEQUENCES OF THE SECULAR MASS EFFECT 

A. Principles of dynamics revisited 

By virtue of the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial 

 
masses that should apply not only to ordinary matter but also to dark matter [30], the 
most readily predictable consequence of the secular increase in the gravitational mass is 
a modification of classical mechanics principles. 

A force F acting on a body induces temporal changes in the body’s momentum 

 
mv, which may in turn be used as the definition of force. With the aid of Eq. (2) one 
may get, in usual notations (note also that v = |v|):

This equation differs from Newton’s second law due to the time dependence of the 
mass. 

If no external force, in the classical sense, acts upon the moving object, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
motion equation becomes: 

vλ−=&

which implies that “freely” moving bodies undergo a cosmic deceleration so that, in the 
limit of short time intervals, their speed varies as:

This is in stark contrast with Newton’s first law that asserts that moving bodies should 
maintain indefinitely their uniform motion in the absence of external forces. 

A similarity between this “cosmic” deceleration, and the anomalous acceleration 

 
experienced by the Pioneer 10/11 spacecraft [11, 12] catches our attention. However, 
the Pioneer problem also involves the solar gravitation, and we will discuss it not until 
laying down the equation of motion in gravitational field in the next sub-section. 

Unlike the first two principles, Newton’s third law, maintaining that the actions 

 
of two bodies upon each other are equal and directed oppositely, is left unchanged 
within the framework of this paper. 

B. Dynamics of gravitating bodies 

The secular mass increase may, in general, result in a modification of the 
 
equation of motion for gravitating bodies. To illustrate, consider the simpler but 
convenient problem of a small body of mass m orbiting around a central body (e.g., the 
Sun) of mass M >> m at a distance r in the body M’s proper frame. We can identify two 
different situations, depending on whether or not the body m’s halo interferes with the 
Sun central core (i.e., what we usually call “the Sun”), as detailed in Fig. 2. 

If the body of mass m refers to the Earth or other planet (Fig. 2), whose halo 

 
may extend well beyond the Sun position, according to postulate (4) any accreted mass 
will mostly increase the halo size, and according to Newton’s first theorem [7] the 
additional halo shell will produce no net gravitational force. The Earth dynamics would 
therefore remain unaffected by the secular mass increase, and we are left with a 
classical Kepler problem. 

 
If, by contrast, the object’s halo does not reach the Sun (as is the case with the 
objects A or P in Fig. 2 possessing very small or no external haloes), its dynamics will 
be markedly affected by the secular mass increase. Let us define the gravitational force 
experienced by the small body as:

FIG. 2. The Sun and other objects in the solar system are extended particles, or particles with 
cold dark matter haloes. Symbol significance: S – the Sun; SH – Sun halo; E – planet (e.g., the 
Earth); EH – planet halo; A – asteroid or other small body on “closed” orbit around the Sun; P – 
small body (such as the Pioneer spacecraft) on open orbit. Note that the orbits of objects 
traveling through the Sun’s cold dark matter halo may be affected (objects A and P) or not 
(object E) by their motion-induced halo mass increase [expressed by Eq. (2)], depending on the 
degree by which their own halo extends with respect to Sun’s central core S. 

If M varies in time (according to the relation m(t) + M(t) = constant) it has a nonzero 
space gradient [31], which can, however, be ignored for nonrelativistic velocities. We 
thus recover the Newton’s equation for the gravitational force, with time-variable m and 
M (which we have already used in obtaining the λ above): 

By combining Eqs. (5) and (8) one gets the equation of motion for the small body,

which departs markedly from the classical Kepler problem, due to the viscous-drag-like

where  l

 is the specific angular momentum. 

 
The latter equation states that the angular momentum is dissipated at a rate 
dependent on velocity. This may cause a small body, such as an asteroid, comet, or even 
distant planets in the solar system (object A in Fig. 2), to fall towards the Sun, until 
possibly reaching a stable orbit at a distance equal with or smaller than the body’s halo 
radius, as mentioned at the beginning of this discussion on dynamics. Such a 
mechanism may furnish an alternative explanation [16] for the presence of large-mass 
objects in small orbits around nearby stars, assuming that a large planet could have 
migrated on lower orbits before acquiring a halo that would be large enough to ensure 
stable orbits. 

C. Radial motion and the “Pioneer” effect 

Analysis of radio Doppler and ranging data from distant spacecraft (Pioneer 
 
10/11) departing the solar system, elegantly done by Anderson and coworkers and 
reported in recent papers [11, 12], seems to support our inferred “cosmic” deceleration 
of moving bodies. Indeed, the two Pioneer spacecraft underwent an anomalous constant 
(over a period of ~10 years) radial deceleration with respect to the Sun, which could not 
be unequivocally explained [12], either “prosaically” (i.e., by technological-related 
imperfections of the space travel and by known physics) or by various new as well as 
old theories. 

 
Equation (10) provides an explanation: The Pioneers moving on hyperbolic 
orbits generate large radial speed components  r  of 12.0 ± 0.3 km/s, but negligible 
angular speeds θ  (see Fig. 2). Thus, a radial acceleration,

is predicted, which departs from the classical mechanics’ situation by an ‘anomalous’ 
term 

(The time dependence in M does not make sizeable contribution to the anomalous 
acceleration and was therefore ignored.) With λ = (6.85 ± 1.19) × 10-18 m-1 determined 
above, an acceleration of (−9.9 ± 2.2) × 10-10 m s-2 is predicted for the Pioneer 10/11 
spacecraft. This and the experimentally determined [12] anomalous Pioneer 10/11 
acceleration of (−8.7 ± 0.9) × 10-10 m/s2 agree remarkably well, considering their 
respective uncertainties and given that neither the “Pioneer” experiment nor those 
forming the basis of this paper were specifically designed to detect such effects. 

It is to be added that the experimental value for the Pioneer 10/11 anomalous 

 
acceleration has been calculated [12] as a mean for the two spacecraft, while the present 

10 

 

paper proposes that it depends on the spacecraft radial velocity. However, the odds were 
that the two Pioneers recede in space at almost equal speeds, and their small difference 
has been therefore included only in the form of speed error in our calculation of the 
anomalous acceleration. Detailed analysis should be carried out for each spacecraft 
tracking data separately to better probe their degree of agreement with the predictions of 
this paper.

My analysis above of the published small-scale gravitational measurements has 
revealed a surprisingly large secular variation in the gravitational force that, due to the 
nature of the determinations, appeared formally as a variation in the Newton’s 
gravitational constant G with time. When reinterpreted as mass increase of the form

cold dark matter halo of the Sun, this phenomenon predicted substantial deviations from 
Newtonian dynamics in the solar system, and particularly a cosmic acceleration that for 
the Pioneer 10/11 spacecraft agrees closely with the published experimental value [12]. 
(Note that a true secular increase in G at the observed rate, besides contradicting a host 
of other experiments – see above –, would explain neither the value of the Pioneer 
acceleration, nor its patent constancy.) In my search for the best model for this secular 
mass increase, I have also explored the possibility that 
, which would 
be compatible with a hot dark matter scenario, under which even resting bodies may 
undergo secular mass increase, due this time to rapidly moving dark matter particles 
impacting the body. I have finally decided in favor of the cold dark matter scenario 
since the hot dark matter hypothesis: (1) produced a Pioneer acceleration too large by a 
factor of three, and (2) did not provide a viable explanation for the stability of the 
planetary orbits.

It is worth noting that computations based on known expressions for the 
 
gravitational light deflection, redshift and time dilation, and the Shapiro light time delay 
[5] (taking M as time dependent and assuming that those formulas are exact to the first 
order in time) showed secular variation in these effects that would be beyond the 
detection limit of any presently known method. 

As far as I can see, there are some possibilities for the secular effect discussed in 

 
this paper to be independently confirmed. The first hope is that the rate of variation in 
the gravitational attraction of about 10-5 year-1 obtained in this work should shortly 
come within the reach of the, e.g., Gundlach et al’s apparatus sensitivity [32]. Secondly, 
detailed studies may be carried out to identify any deviations from Newtonian dynamics 
in the motion of small objects in the solar system, such as asteroids and comets. The 
latter method could be more specific, as it might be able to discriminate between m and 
G variations. A variation in G is already very improbable but, for the meticulous 
experimentalist, a direct proof could make a difference.

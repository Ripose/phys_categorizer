ABSTRACT

The question: "How many different trajectories are there on a single

invariant  torus  within  the  phase  space  of  an  integrable  Hamiltonian

system?" is posed. A rigorous answer to the question is found both for the

rational  and  the  irrational  tori.  The  relevant  notion  of  non-measurable

sets is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Irrational invariant tori play a crucial role in physics of Hamiltonian systems. In contrast to the

rational  tori,  they  prove  to  be  to  some  extent  resistant  to  the  destructive  action  of  the

non-integrable  perturbations  and,  as  the  KAM  theorem  establishes  it,  the  measure  of  the  set  of

those  tori  which  remain  intact,  though  obviously  distorted,  is  non-zero  at  low  levels  of  the

perturbation.1

 It is the aim of this paper to indicate a peculiar property of irrational tori: non-measurability of

sets  of  points  which  initiate  on  them  all  possible  (and  different)  trajectories.  To  make  the

considerations  which  follow  as  clear  as  possible,  we  fix  our  attention  on  the  simplest  nontrivial

case  -  a  Hamiltonian  system  with  but  two  degrees  of  freedom  q1  and  q2  whose  trajectories  are
located within a four-dimensional phase space Γ. (Generalisation for more degrees of freedom is

trivial.) We assume that the system is integrable, i.e. there exist two integrals of motion I1 and I2

which  allow  one  to  describe  any  motion  of  the  system  as  two  independent  rotations  on  a  two-

dimensional torus; see Figure1.

In the most  general  case,  the  two  frequencies  are different on each of the  tori  into  which  the

whole  phase  space  of  the  system  is  partitioned.  There  are  two  basic  types  of  the  tori:  those  for
which the ratio ω

2 is rational and those for which the ratio is irrational.

Let us ask a question: How many different trajectories are there on a single: (i) rational and (ii)

irrational torus ?

To observe trajectories which move on the torus T in a more convenient manner, we cut it with

a Poincaré section S. In this plane a single trajectory is seen as a sequence of points which mark all

its consecutive (past and future) passages through S. All the points are located, of course, on the
circle  C  =  T  ∩  S.  A  single  point  from  such  a  sequence  determines  the  whole  (and  single)

trajectory.  There  are  many  different  (disjoint)  trajectories  moving  on  the  torus.  Each  of  them

defines on C a sequence of points. Choosing single points from all such sequences allows one to

construct the required set of points which initiate on the torus different trajectories. Let us denote

the set by M0. Thus, the question we posed above can be reduced to the following one: How big is
the set M0?.

By "how big" we mean here two things :

1.  Is the set M0 countable ?

2.  Which is its measure µ(M0) ?

irrational ones.

II. µµµµ(M0) ON RATIONAL TORI.

  Below we shall answer the questions, first, for the case of rational tori, then, for the case of the

  Let  Tr  be a rational torus, i.e. a  torus for which  ω

2 = r = m/n, where m and n are integers.
Any  trajectory  on    Tr    marks  in  S  as  a  cycle  of  n  points  {Pk},  k=0,  1,  …,  n-1,  whose  angular
coordinates ϕ

  As easy to note, all trajectories which start from those points  on C whose  ϕ coordinates are

located within any interval [ϕ

0, ϕ

0+2π/n), where ϕ

0 is arbitrary, are different and, as such a choice

is made, there are no other different trajectories.

  Consequently, the set

can be seen as the simplest realisation of the set of points which initiate on T all possible different

trajectories.

Obviously, in this case, the set is uncountable and its measure :

III. µµµµ(M0) FOR IRRATIONAL TORI.

  Let ω1/ω2 = ρ be an irrational number. Now, any trajectory on Tρ is seen within the Poincaré
section S as an infinite, never repeating itself sequence of points {Pk}, k= -∞ …, -1, 0, 1, 2, … +∞,

whose angular coordinates are given by

The countable set {Pk} covers C in a dense manner but is different from it: C\{Pk}≠∅. Thus,

there are on C some points which initiate other trajectories. How to find all of them i.e. define set

M0 ?  To reach the aim we shall proceed in three steps.

Step 1. We define within the [0,1) interval a countable, everywhere dense set

Step 2. We define in C a relation ℜ:

PℜQ if and only if there exists in E an x such that:

−

x

(9)

In plain words the physical meaning of ℜ can be expressed as follows :

P and Q stay in relation ℜ when they belong to the same trajectory.

One can prove that ℜ is an equivalence relation, thus, ℜ divides C into a family of equivalence

classes C/ℜ. In view of the physical meaning of ℜ the classes are simply Poincaré section images

of  trajectories  which  move  on  the  torus  T.  Since  the  classes  are  disjoint,  the  trajectories  they

represent are all different. Since the classes cover all C - there are no other trajectories.

Step  3.  From  each  class  from  the  family  C/ℜ  we  take  one  point  and  put  it  into  a  set  M0.
Obviously, the set M0 can be seen as the set of points which initiate on T different and all possible

trajectories. Let us have a closer look at it.

First of all, we may check what happens when trajectories initiated by all points from M0 pass
through the Poincaré section S. Let sets Mk , k=-∞, …, -1, 0, 1,…, +∞, be the images of M0 which
appear in C as the trajectories make consecutive turns on T. All the sets are disjoint:

and their union covers whole C:

Since  C  is  uncountable  (continuum)  and  the  family  of  sets  {Mk}  is  only  countable,  the

equipollent sets  Mk cannot  be  countable.  In  particular, M0 is  uncountable.  This  answers  the  first

part of the question.

Now, let us consider its second part. Since each Mk can be obtained from M0 by a rotation of
the latter along C by an angle 2π[kρ (mod 1)], all of the sets are mutually congruent. Thus, if the
measure of the set M0 is µ(M0), the measure µ(Mk) of each Mk must be the same:

On the other hand, in view of Eq.11 , we have

How much is µ(M0) ? It cannot be zero, since in that case Eq.13 would give µ(C)=0, which is
not  true.  On  the  other  hand,  it  cannot  be  finite  either,  since  in  that  case  we  would  obtain  from
Eq.13 µ(C)=∞ . Thus: How much is it ? We cannot say. A number which would describe the value
of µ(M0) does not exist : the set M0 is non-measurable.

IV. DISCUSSION

The  reasoning  we  described  in  Section  III  can  be  seen  as  a  direct  translation  of  the  Vitali
construction  of  a  non-measurable  set  2,3  onto  the  language  of  the  Hamiltonian  mechanics.  As  a

careful reader may have noted, step 3 of the construction we presented makes use of the Axiom of

Choice (AC) , the most controversial and at the same time, the most thoroughly studied pillar from
the few ones on which the theory of sets can be built4. We write "can", since, being both relatively
consistent5 with other axioms of the set theory and independent6 of them, the axiom can be used or

not. Taking the former attitude, i.e. deciding to use the Axiom, one is able not only to prove a few

most useful theorems (impossible to prove without the axiom), such as that the union of countably

many countable sets is countable or that every infinite set has a denumerable subset, but, and this

is  most  disturbing,  a  number  of  theorems  which  seem  to  stay  in  contradiction  with  what  our
common sense tells. The most famous from such theorems, proven by Banach and  Tarski7, says

that it is possible to dismount a sphere into a few (at least five) such subsets, from which, using but

translations and rotations i.e. transformations which certainly preserve measure, one can mount

two spheres identical with the initial one. Obviously, the Banach-Tarski theorem stays in conflict

with  our  common  sense.  But  was  it  not  like  that  already  once  with  the  theorems  of  the  non-

Euclidean geometry? The problem is not, we emphasise it, if the Banach-Tarski theorem is true or

not; its proof is clean and completely legitimate within a certain mathematical environment. One

should rather ask if  we need this  branch  of mathematics  to  describe things  which  happen  in  the

world  and  which  we  study  in  physics  laboratories.  (Non-Euclidean  geometry  has  proven  its

usefulness  in  the  description  of  our  world  at  scales  somewhat  larger  from  that  at  which  our

common sense is formed.) Do we know phenomena whose description would necessarily require

the use of the axiom of choice? There have been so far but a few attempts of applying the axiom

of choice based mathematics to describe physical reality. The first one was the Pitowsky’s work
on  a  possible  resolution  of  the  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen  paradox  via  the  Banach-Tarski  one8,9.

The work by Pitowsky indicated the possibility that physical paradoxes encountered in quantum
mechanics can be reduced to mathematical pathologies8. The aim of the present note is somewhat

different. It shows that such a mathematical pathology (non-measurability) appears in the formal

analysis of a very simple problem of classical mechanics and cannot be avoided there; one cannot

answer  the  question  concerning  the  number  of  trajectories  on  irrational  tori  without  using  the

axiom of choice. Consequently, if one decides to answer the question one must necessarily get in

touch with the paradoxical concept of sets without measure.

A  similar  problem  and  a  similar  way  of  solving  it  is  described  in  [10],  where  Svozil  and

Neufeld analyse the  concept  of linear  chaos. A  general, very vivid exposition of the  problem of

applicability  of  the  set  theory  in  the  description  of  the  physical  world  can  be  found  in  [11].  As

Svozil argues there, the prohibition on the use of paradoxical results  of the  set theory cannot be

accepted. Such a “No-Go” attitude, as he calls it, has no justification. According to Svozil, the No-

Go attitude should be rejected in favour of the “Go-Go” attitude, according to which results of any

consistent  mathematical  theory  may  be  used  in  the  description  of  the  physical  world.  From  the

Svozil’s point of view, the present authors took a full advantage of the Go-Go attitude: using the

based on the Axiom of Choice notion of  non-measurable set  they  answered  a  concrete,  sensible

question  formulated  within  the  frames  of  classical  mechanics.  An  extensive  study  of  the  links

between  physics  and  set  theory  was  presented  also  by  Augenstein  [12],  who  among  other

examples draws our attention to the use by El Naschie of the paradoxical decomposition technique

in the analysis of the Cantorian micro space-time [13].

Concluding  the present  work,  we  admit  that  defining  the  set  of  points  which  on  an  irrational

invariant  torus  initiate  different  trajectories  we  did  use  the  Axiom  of  Choice.  From  the  formal

point of view the definition must be seen as a nonconstructive one. In Svozil’s wording: throwing

out the nonconstructive bath water we would throw with it the nonmeasurable baby [10]. We think

it would be not right.

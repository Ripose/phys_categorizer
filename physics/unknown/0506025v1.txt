Abstract 

The  principle  of  coherent  Dicke  narrowing  in  a  thin  vapour  cell,  in  which  sub-Doppler 

spectral lineshapes are observed under a normal irradiation for a l /2 thickness, is generalized 

to two-photon spectroscopy. Only the sum of the two wave vectors must be normal to the cell,  

making the two-photon scheme highly versatile. A comparison is provided between the Dicke 

narrowing  with  copropagating  fields,  and  the  residual  Doppler-broadening  occurring  with 

counterpropagating geometries. The experimental feasibility is discussed on the basis of a first 

observation  of  a  two-photon  resonance  in  a  300  nm-thick  Cs  cell.  Extension  to  the  Raman 

situation is finally considered. 

  

Linear  spectroscopy  in  a  macroscopic  low-pressure  gas  is  usually  sensitive  to  the 
r
‰ u (with u the most probable thermal velocity, and  k

r
Doppler broadening, as governed by ‰ k

 

the  wave  vector  of  the  irradiating  field).  In  c.w.  multiphoton  spectroscopy,  when  several 

irradiating  beams  (w

i, 

)  are  used,  the  Doppler  broadening  generalizes  to  ‰

When  a  cell  of  dilute  gas  is  so  thin  that  atomic  (or  molecular)  trajectories  are  mostly  from 

wall-to-wall,  sub-Doppler  spectral  lineshapes  can  be  obtained  in  a  variety  of  processes 

(optical pumping, ...) under normal incidence : this results from a specific enhancement of the 

slow atoms contribution (see [2] and refs. therein), with respect to the transient nature of the 

atom-light interaction. In linear optical absorption, a particular coherent narrowing has been 

experimentally observed for a l /2 cell thickness [3,4], analogous to the one first mentioned by 

Romer and Dicke [5] in the microwave domain. The purpose of this note is to show that the 

main  features  of  this  coherent  Dicke  narrowing  can  be  extended  to  two-  (or  multi-)  photon 

transitions,  as  long  as  an  effective  two-level  model  can  be  considered,  and  for  a  normal 

incidence condition now referring to  the sum of photon wave-vectors ‰

 Let  us  first  recall  that  for  a  cell  filled  with  two-level  atoms,  the  1-photon  resonant 

transmission  (or  reflection  [6-7])    behaviour  depends  on  the  field  radiated  by  the  induced 

macroscopic polarization, resulting from  the spatial summing of the local optical coherence, 

as given by the quantity Re[If] with:

In (1), L is the cell length, Oz is the axis normal to the thin cell, f(vz) the velocity distribution, 

usually assumed to be Maxwellian. Assuming a linear regime of interaction, s 21(z,vz) is given 

as a result of the elapsed time t = z/vz from the wall departure (for vz > 0), where s 21=0, by :

the relaxation coefficient of the optical dipole and D

 the frequency detuning between the field 

and the 1> ﬁ

 2> transition. Note that assuming a normal incidence, the Doppler shift has 

been counted on the same direction as the one along which the interaction time is measured 

(i.e.  for 

v.k =

zkv

).  For  vz  <  0  ,  z/vz  is  replaced  by  (z - L)/vz  .  The  transmission  lineshape 

strongly depends on the L thickness [3, 4, 8]: it oscillates, with a pseudo-periodicity l

, from a 

sub-Doppler  width  (for  L  =  (2n+1)l /2)    to  a  Doppler-broadened  one  (for  L  =  nl ).  The 

narrowest lineshape is for the l /2 thickness as in the situation analyzed by Romer and Dicke 

[5]. It exhibits a logarithmic singularity (in the limiting case ku >> g 21), originating in the 1/vz 

contribution of fast atoms. Also, in spite of a mismatching brought by the Doppler detuning 

[3,4], all velocity groups interfere constructively up to the l /2 thickness. 

     In  the  extension  to  a  two-photon  situation  -see  fig.  1-,    one  monitors  the  (w

irradiating frequencies w

2 are far enough from the resonances w

21  and w

32, the pump-

induced optical coherence s 32(z) simply results from the transient regime of the resonant two-

photon coherence s 31(z). The assumption is that the sum of the exciting frequencies w

nearly  two-photon  resonant,  i.e  that  D 31 = (w

31  remains  comparable  with  the  two-

photon  width  (homogenous  width  g 31,  or  at  least  with  the  Doppler  broadened  width

and a third order perturbation expansion (second order with respect to the "pump" field, first

s 32.   

       The  essence  of  the  extension  of  the  coherent  Dicke  narrowing  to  two-photon  transition 

lies in the fact that the s 32(z, ,vz) behaviour  is strictly analogous to the one of s 21(z, vz) in (1),

A justification for (3) can be obtained from an exact calculation of s 32 , as provided in 

the appendix A in the non-restrictive frame of a conservative 3-level system. The full analogy 

of (3) with (2) is responsible for the two-photon coherent Dicke narrowing, but it should be 

noted that the complex phase factor now depends upon the vectorial sum of the  wavevectors

remaining  along  the  normal.  This  versatility  may  be  used  as  an  advantage  by  choosing  an 

irradiation close to the Brewster angle (provided that the wavelengths of pump and probe are 

not too different) (see fig. 2, and [9]), hence eliminating the Fabry-Perot effects [7] associated

with  ETC  spectroscopy.  Also,  it  opens  the  possibility  to  optimize,  with  the  choice  of 

incidence angles, the Dicke narrowing for a given cell thickness.   

The  above  description  allows  for  a  comparison  between  the  co-  and  counter-

propagating  geometries.  When  the  two  irradiating  frequencies  are  nearly  equal  (w

1»

2),  a 

counter-propagating  geometry  provides  a  negligible  Doppler  broadening  in  a  macroscopic 

cell, while the co-propagating geometry is affected by a Doppler broadening twice as large as 

the one for 1-photon transition. In contrast,  for an ETC  with a thickness suitable for the 2-

photon Dicke narrowing in the co-propagating geometry -i.e. L = L

/2 = l 1.l 2/2(l 1+l 2) (»

1/4 

2/4)-  ,  the  counter-propagating  geometry  corresponds  to  an  ETC  thickness  much  smaller 

than  the  optimal  one  (i.e.  L<<L

  with  L

 = l 1 l 2 /‰

1  -  l 2‰ ),  implying  a  spectral  regime 

dominated by transit time effects, so that the two-geometries provide comparable spectra (see 

fig.  3).  Moreover,  when  w

1  and  w

2largely  differ,  the  sub-Doppler  Dicke  narrowing  can  still  

be  attained  (in  the  co-propagating  geometry  for  a  specific  well-chosen  thickness,  or  if 

preferable, with an adapted oblique geometry), while the counter-propagating geometry,  that 

would be sensitive to a partial Doppler broadening in a macroscopic cell, actually undergoes a 

reduction  of  this Doppler broadening  through transit time effects, at the expense of a drastic 

reduction of the contributing velocities. Besides, a frequency-modulation (FM) technique [3] 

can turn these narrow spectra into Doppler-free lineshapes. 

The possible observation, and benefits, of such a 2-photon coherent narrowing could 

be  limited  by  the  large  1-photon  detuning  D

,  with  respect  to  a  signal  decreasing  with  1/D

². 

Because  tuneable  sources  open  the  possibility  to  strongly  increase  the  strength  of  a  two-

photon signal by coming close to a nearly-resonant 1-photon excitation, it is worth discussing 

practical limitations. It is essential for the validity of (3) that D

 (or D21 and D32, see appendix 

A)  largely  exceeds  ‰ vz‰

/L.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  2-photon  Dicke  narrowing  (for  L 

=(2n+1)L

/2)  induces  a  sub-Doppler  structure  through  an  overweighed  contribution  of  the 

w

slow  atoms,  the  coherent  (and  constructive)  contribution  of  atoms  with  thermal  velocities 

cannot be neglected, even at line-centre, and the requirement: exp-[D

/2vz] << 1 applies also 

to  fast  (i.e.  thermal)  atoms,  practically  implying  for  the  detuning  to  be  in  excess  of  several 

Doppler widths.  However, for an oblique and large angle incidence (e.g. fig. 2), the 2-photon 

Dicke-type  narrowing  could  remain  observable,  even  for  a  relatively  weak  detuning  D

: 

indeed, the successive 1-photon processes cannot eliminate the Doppler-broadening when two 

different   

1k   and 

2k   axes    are  involved,  so  that  the  stepwise  excitation  process  cannot 

strongly interfere with the 2-photon process. As a counterpart of the large pump detuning,  the 

pump  intensity  can  be  high,  as  the  condition  W

1,  W

2  <<  ‰

  required  by  the  3rd  order 

perturbation  expansion,  that  imposes  a  Stark  shift  much  smaller  than  D

,  remains  easily 

respected.  

 With  respect  to  these  sensitivity  limitations,  it  is  worth  reporting  a  previous 

observation,  although  performed  in  a  counter-propagating  geometry,  of  a  direct  two-photon 

transition in a sub-micrometric cell. In the context of ETC spectroscopy on the stepwise 6S1/2 

-(6P3/2)- 6D5/2 transition of Cs, the direct two-photon excitation was observed in an extended 

frequency scan. The pump frequency w

1, locked onto the 1-photon 852 nm resonance for the 

6S1/2  (F=3)  ﬁ

  6P3/2  transition,  is  indeed  a  blue-detuned  pump  for  the  6S1/2  (F=4)  ﬁ

  6P3/2 

transition, with the D

 = 9.192 GHz detuning largely exceeds any relevant width for a 2-photon 

transition.  This  justifies  that  when  scanning  the  917  nm  probe  on  the  6P3/2-6D5/2  transition, 

one  observes  (fig.  4),  aside  from  the  stepwise  2-photon  resonance,  a  red-shifted  resonance 

associated to the direct two-photon transition 6S1/2 (F=4) ﬁ

 6D5/2.  

The  main  information  derived  from  this  recording  is  that,  in  spite  of  the  unusually 

small  size  (L = 315nm)  of  the  cell,  the  two-photon  signal  is  observable,  and  here  of  a 

relatively large size. The absorption is in excess of 10-3, and the signal-to-noise ratio is easily 

improvable, as for the specific purpose of the stepwise excitation experiment, the sensitivity 

L
D
‰
of the set-up was non-optimized and limited to ~10-4. Also, the two-photon signal, observed 

here  for  a  moderate  pump  intensity  (1mW  focused  on  a  ~100µm  spot,  i.e.  W

1  ~  250MHz), 

could be largely enhanced by decreasing the 9.192 GHz pump detuning, while remaining in 

the frame of a non resonant 2-photon transition. These potential improvements should enable 

the observation of the two-photon signal at a lower atomic density,  the effect of which seems 

to be the dominant reason for the unexpectedly broad two-photon signal (the 6D5/2 hyperfine 

structure  accounts  only  for  ~50MHz,  the  counterpropagating  geometry  only  allows  a  ~20 

MHz 2-photon Doppler broadening, and the transit time is typically in excess of 1.5ns - i.e. a 

broadening  below  100  MHz  -).  It  can  be  also  noted  that  the  direct  2-photon  signal  is  less 

sensitive to the pressure broadening than the stepwise excitation because resonance collision 

processes affect the intermediate transitions.  

In  conclusion,  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  recently  demonstrated  coherent  Dicke 

narrowing in an ETC can be extended through versatile set-ups to 2-photon transitions, and a 

genuine  experimental  observation  appears  quite  feasible.  Even  if  the  Dicke  narrowing  may 

remain only of a marginal interest for precision spectroscopy (the fabrication of ETCs [4,10] 

requires  thick  windows  for  a  small  active  thickness),  several  possible  applications  can  be 

envisioned. ETCs are already an interesting tool for the probing of atom-surface interaction, 

notably  for  the  effective  analysis  of  the  spatial  dependence  of  long-distance  atom-surface 

interaction  [11].  The  high-lying  excited  states,  of  a  special  interest  in  this  context,  can  be 

conveniently reached with 2- or multi- photon excitation. Direct transitions from the ground 

states are naturally simpler to analyze than multiple stepwise excitation : in particular there is 

no need to assume a quasi-thermal pumping (see e.g.[12]), hardly justified in an ETC, and that 

ignores the surface interaction that shifts the 1-photon resonance. Moreover, because there is a 

physical upper limit to the atom-surface distance, the effect of atom-surface interaction in a 

multi-photon transition should be simpler to analyze in ETC spectroscopy than in the alternate 

selective reflection (SR) spectroscopy (see [12]) : in this last case, the effective length of the 

probed region under multiple beam irradiation has never been determined unambiguously in 

spite of various principle analysis [13]. Extension of the multi-photon Dicke narrowing to L

-

type  systems  based  upon  Raman  transitions  in  a  counter-propagating  geometry  can  also  be 

predicted, with 

k -
1 k

 the relevant wavevector. For Raman transitions between sublevels of 

the ground state, the expected long lifetime of the Raman coherence should make observable 

a large number of collapses and revivals of the Dicke narrowing (for Cs, and a ground state 

coherence lifetime assumed to be ~1 µs, the decoherence length is ~ 200 µm, to be compared 

with  a  Dicke  periodicity  L =426  nm  for  an  excitation  close  to  the  D2  line  with  counter-

propagating  beams).  Hence,  with  relatively  long  cells  (~10-100  µm),  a  new-type  of  ground 

state Raman coherence analysis appears feasible. The effective decay of the Raman coherence 

narrowing, measured through an adjustable cell length or through an angular adjustement of 

the respective exciting beams, could yield sensitive information on how the environment  -and 

confinement-  affects the details of the relaxation of the Raman coherence.  

This  work  has  been  partially  supported  by  FASTNet  (European  contract  HPRN-CT-

2002-00304) and by the RILA (#09813UK ) French-Bulgarian cooperation.  We acknowledge 

the participation of L. Petrov to some of the experimental steps.  

Appendix A 

 

We give below the spatial dependence of the transient optical coherence s 32. The calculation 

is obtained in the frame of a third-order perturbation expansion, and for the sake of simplicity, 

a conservative atomic system is assumed, with negligible dephasing collisions. In spite of the 

non  resonant  nature  of  the  pump  excitation,  the  rotating  wave    approximation  is  performed 

also with respect to the pump, simply assuming that ‰

  : our scope is 

indeed to define conditions for which the elementary two-photon processes dominates in the 

competition with the nearly resonant stepwise (1-photon) processes. Under such hypotheses,

denominator on the order of D31D 2, the first one is simply the 2-photon coherence contribution 

appearing  in  (3)  (after  some  firther  simplifications).  Surprisingly  enough,  the  other  one  

originates  in  a  transient  build-up  of  population  in  the  relay  level  2>,  but  the  exponential 

factor shows that the contribution associated with the build-up of population induced in the 

level 2> is limited to a very short duration ~ 1/D 2 (» 1/D ), during which the system does not 

have time to experience the 1-photon detuning. Hence, for any reasonable length of the ETC, 

only the resonant two-photon coherence survives.

locked to the 6S1/2(F=3)-6P3/2 transition. The hyperfine structure of the 6S1/2-6P3/2-6D5/2 levels 

is also shown.

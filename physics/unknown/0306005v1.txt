Abstract 

We  explore  the  potential  impact  of  colored  noise  on 
space-charge-induced  halo  formation. 
  By  coupling 
particle orbits to parametric resonance, colored noise due 
to  space-charge  fluctuations  and/or  imperfections  in  the 
beamline  can  eject  particles  to  much  larger  amplitudes 
than would be inferred from parametric resonance alone. 

INTRODUCTION 
The  pursuit  of  high-current  light-ion  accelerators  such 
as  are  needed  to  drive  high-intensity  spallation  neutron 
sources  has brought the realization that, albeit necessary, 
the ability to control root-mean-square beam properties is 
not  sufficient.    Perhaps  the  most  prominent  example 
concerns beam halos, i.e., particles that reach large orbital 
amplitudes  due  to  time  dependence  in  the  space-charge 
potential.    The  concern  is  that  impingement  of  beam 
particles  on  the  beamline  could  generate  radioactivation 
that  would preclude routine, hands-on maintenance.  Just 
a tiny impingement (~1 nA/m/GeV) is troublesome.  For a 
100 mA, 1 GeV light-ion beam, this criterion translates to 
just 1 in 108 particles lost per meter [1]. 

Early efforts to identify the fundamental mechanisms of 
halo  formation  centered  on  the  use  of  a  ‘particle-core’ 
model [2,3].  The basic recognition was that if a uniform-
density core is  made to pulsate, particles that  initially lie 
outside the core and  that resonate  with its pulsations can 
reach large amplitudes and form a ‘halo’.  This led to the 
identification  of  parametric  resonance  as  the  essential 
mechanism of halo formation. 

The key feature of parametric resonance in the context 
of  the  particle-core  model  is  a  hard  upper  bound  to  the 
amplitude that a halo particle can reach [4].  The particle’s 
orbital frequency is a function of its amplitude.  At large 
amplitude the particle falls out of resonance with the core, 
thereby  preventing  the  amplitude  from  growing  further.  
This  lends  hope  to  the  possibility  of  computing  an 
aperture  requirement  for  beamline  components;  smaller 
aperture  requirements  are  preferred  in  that,  for  example, 
they  mitigate  concerns  about  shunt  impedance  in  the 
accelerating cavities. 

An  important  question  is  whether  there  is  any  physics 
not  included  in  the  particle-core  model  that  could 
significantly  influence  the  maximum  particle  amplitude.  
Herein  we  show  that  the  answer  is  yes;  the  presence  of 
colored  noise  can  potentially  boost  a  statistically  rare 
particle to much larger amplitudes by continually kicking 
it back into phase with the core oscillation.

in which tc is the autocorrelation time.  Upon generating a 
colored-noise signal, we calculate 〈|δω|〉 which becomes a 
measure of the noise strength.  Colored noise is a realistic 
phenomenon that will arise self-consistently from charge-
density variations and from irregularities in the beamline; 
in the former case the autocorrelation time could be short, 
say of the order of a plasma period, and in the latter case 
it could be long, say several betatron (orbital) periods [5]. 
We fix the mismatch parameter at M=1.5, and the initial 
conditions of the orbit at x(0)=1.2, 
  The orbit is 
computed from Eq. (1) first without, then with, the noise 
of  Eq.  (2)  using  a  variable-time-step  integrator.  For  zero 
colored  noise,  the  maximum  amplitude  |xmax|  depends  on 
the  core-oscillation  frequency  ω0;  Fig.  1  shows  this 
dependence.    The  particle  can  reach  relatively  large 
amplitudes  for  a  wide  range  of  frequencies  ω0.    We 
present results for ω0=3.53 because the associated power 
spectra of the orbits are especially clear; different choices 
of ω0 do not change the essential findings.

We consider the colored noise to be a random process, 
which  means  each  individual  particle  will  see  a  different 
manifestation  of  the  noise.    Thus,  in  an  ‘axisymmetric’ 
model,  such  as  that  of  Eq.  (1),  each  particle  initially 
occupying  a  thin  annulus  centered  at  radius  x(0)  will 
experience noise that differs from that seen by each of the 
other  particles.      Accordingly,  we  adopted  a  ‘survey 
strategy’.    For  the  given  initial  conditions  and  a  specific 
choice  of  noise  parameters,  we  sequentially  computed 
10,000  orbits,  each  experiencing 
its  own  random 
manifestation of the colored noise, and we catalogued the 
maximum  amplitudes  of  these  orbits.    As  is  shown  and 
explained below, the colored noise will keep a statistically 
rare  particle  in  phase  with  the  core  oscillation  such  that 
this particle reaches much larger amplitudes than without 
its 
colored  noise. 
maximum  amplitude  will  grow  indefinitely.    We  shall 
demonstrate that there is in principle no hard upper bound 
to the halo amplitude in the presence of colored noise.

RESULTS 

Without Colored Noise 

The  case  of  zero  noise  constitutes  the  baseline  against 
which  to  assess  the  influence  of  colored  noise.    The 
corresponding orbit x(t) and its power spectrum appear in 
Fig. 2.  The orbit, which we integrated to high precision, 
reaches  a  maximum  radius  xmax=3.9;  it  goes  no  further 
regardless  how  long  the  orbit  is  integrated.    Parametric 
resonance  indeed  establishes  a  hard  upper  bound  to  the 
orbital amplitude in the absence of noise. 

The  power  spectrum,  however,  is  complicated,  and 
stays  complicated.   As  Fig.  2  suggests,  there  is  interplay 
between harmonics of the external frequency Ω and core-
oscillation  frequency  ω0  (since  time  is  measured  in  the 
unit of the inverse external  frequency, Ω = 1 here).  The 
interplay  results  in  the  formation  of  not  only  several 
prominent spectral lines, but also continua, signifying that 
the orbit is chaotic.

spectrum (Fourier transform of the orbit). 

With Colored Noise 

The influence of noise on halo formation depends on its 
strength  〈|δω|〉  and  its  autocorrelation  time.    For  two 
choices of autocorrelation time, tc = 1τ and tc = 12τ, with 
τ denoting the representative orbital period of the particle, 
we  investigated  a  broad  range  of  strengths,  specifically 
10-5  ≤  〈|δω|〉  ≤  1,  with  the  goal  of  ascertaining  to  what 
extent the results may be regarded as generic.  All of the 
results  presented  herein  derive 
sequential 
computations  of  10,000  orbits  with  noise  randomly 
generated for each orbit separately. 

from 

Fig.  3.    Example  manifestations  of  colored  noise  along 
an orbit for 〈|δω|〉=0.09 and tc=1.5τ  (top), 12τ  (bottom).  

Manifestations of colored noise that a particle might see 
are  illustrated  in  Fig.  3,  which  is  provided  as  an  aid 
toward conceptualizing the physical meaning of the noise 
parameters.    Shown  there  are  manifestations  of  noise  for 
tc= 1.5τ and 12τ for a fixed range 〈|δω|〉=0.09. 

Next, we consider the one particle out of the sample of 
10,000  that  reaches  to  the  largest  amplitude  |xmax|  during 
the integration time of 80τ, which is representative of the 
length of a 1 GeV proton linac.  Results for fixed tc = 12τ 
and 〈|δω|〉=0.09 are provided in Fig. 4,  which  shows this 
special orbit.  Figure 4 also shows the distribution of |xmax| 
for  the  entire  10,000-orbit  sample.    Notice  that  for  this 
case  |xmax|  averaged  over  the  sample  is  less  than  3.9,  the 
value  pertaining  to  the  bare  parametric  resonance.    This 
means the noise kicks ‘typical’ particles out of phase with 
the  core  oscillation  while  it  simultaneously  kicks  rare 
particles  into  phase.     Also  plotted  is  |xmax|  versus  〈|δω|〉, 
from  which  one  sees  that  even  much  weaker  noise  can 
suffice to eject rare particles to larger amplitudes relative 
to  the  parametric  resonance  alone.    This  is  due  to  the 
chaoticity of the orbits in that their inherent continuum of 
frequencies enhances the coupling of the noise to the orbit 
even  when 〈|δω|〉 is small.  The power spectrum of these 
rare  orbits  eventually  becomes  sharply  peaked  at  the 

particle’s orbital frequency.  Interestingly, we find for tc = 
1τ  that  there  is  no  substantial  difference  in  the  results; 
they are qualitatively the same. 

restricted  to  the  simple  particle-core  model  of  Eq.  (1).  
For  example,  we  did  the  same  numerical  experiments 
using a model of a beam bunch in which the unperturbed 
potential  is  a  spherically  symmetric  configuration  in 
thermal  equilibrium  [6]  and  the  perturbation  has  prolate 
spheroidal symmetry with a single driving frequency.  In 
this  potential  the  vast  majority  of  the  orbits  quickly 
became chaotic and coupled to the perturbation.  The net 
effect  as  concerns  halo  production  was  qualitatively  the 
same  as  described  above,  though  the  dynamical  details 
were  richer,  reflecting  the  more  complicated  potential.  
The collection of findings suggests that formation of large 
diffuse  halos  is  not  particularly  sensitive  to  details  in 
either the governing potential or the noise. 

It remains, of course, to explore the extent to which this 
phenomenology applies in a real machine.  Doing so will 
involve  simulations  of  beams  in  real  beamlines.    One 
possibly  fruitful  approach  is  to  extract  the  smooth,  time-
dependent potential from the simulations and then pursue 
a statistical analysis in parallel to what we have done here.  
Alternatively,  the  colored  noise  may  be  built  into  the 
simulation itself.  A realistic manifestation of the colored 
noise  would  need  to  reflect  the  machine  design,  i.e.,  by 
incorporating  imperfections  in  the  fields  and  hardware 
alignment,  and/or  by  including  details  of  the  evolving 
space-charge  potential  such  as  a  sufficiently  detailed 
mode spectrum.  Of course, as the beam is accelerated and 
becomes 
charge  will  become 
space 
decreasingly  important,  and  growth  of  the  halo  will 
thereby be mitigated.

If  the  integration  time  is  extended  indefinitely,  then 
there  are  orbits  that  continue  to  grow  to  seemingly 
unlimited  amplitude.    The  orbit  of  one  such  particle 
appears  in  Fig.  5.    This  long-time  orbit  exemplifies  that 
there is in principle no upper bound to the halo amplitude 
in the presence of colored noise. 

DISCUSSION 
The influence of colored noise on particle orbits, and in 
particular its role in generating large diffuse halos in time-
dependent  potentials,  appears  to  be  generic,  i.e.,  not

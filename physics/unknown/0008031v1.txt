Abstract

We recently developed an analytic theory of cumulative
multibunch beam breakup that includes a linear variation
of  transverse  focusing  across  the  bunch  train.  The
focusing variation saturates the exponential growth of the
beam  breakup  and  establishes  an  algebraic  decay  of  the
transverse bunch displacement  versus  bunch  number.    In
this paper we illustrate how the focusing variation works
to suppress multibunch beam breakup, as well as how the
mechanism scales with accelerator and beam parameters.

1  RESULTS OF ANALYTIC THEORY
We recently developed an analytic theory of cumulative
multibunch beam breakup (MBBU) with a linear variation
of transverse focusing (a form of BNS damping) along the
bunch  train  [1].    It  is  based  on  a  continuum  form  of  the
equation of motion of point bunches in which the discrete
transverse  kicks 
the  rf  structures  are
smoothed along the linac.  For a generic linac in a linear
collider, the solution is:

|sin(
coupling  between  the  deflecting-mode  frequency  and  the
bunch  spacing;  the  expression  is  valid  only  away  from
wake  zero-crossings  and  resonances.    The  fractional
energy spread |f | regulates exponential growth, and finite
Q generates exponential damping.  The singularity at  =1
is  an  unphysical  artifact  of  the  solution  technique;  the
solution  actually  varies  smoothly  through  the  value
indicated for  =1.  However, exponential growth saturates
at  =1 and afterward, for infinite Q, the envelope decays
algebraically with bunch number M.  Therefore  =1 is the
global  maximum  in  the  envelope  | [M|,  and  for  the
focusing variation to be effective, one should ensure that

=1 is reached somewhere along the bunch train before it
exits the linac, i.e., by ensuring |f | > E(1,M)/( N).

2  NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

The analytic solution allows one to decipher the linear-
collider  parameter  space  in  terms  of,  e.g.,  the  projected
emittance, as is done in Ref. [1].  Herein, using numerical
examples,  we  illustrate  the  aforementioned  physical
processes  associated  with  a  linear  focusing  variation.
Table 1 gives baseline parameters used for this purpose.

2.1  Analytic vs. Numerical Solutions

Figure  1,  depicting  the  bunch  train  at  the  linac  exit,
shows  good  agreement  between  the  envelope  | xM(1)|
calculated  analytically  and  bunch  displacements  [M(1)
calculated by solving the equation of motion numerically.
It also shows the qualitative difference in the bunch-train
pattern  between  <1  and  >1;  with  the  parameters  of
Table 1, |f | = 2.2% corresponds to  =1.  Thus, a modest
(few-percent)  focusing  variation  suffices  to  suppress
MBBU,  as  Stupakov  observed  in  simulations  of  a
contemporary Next Linear Collider lattice [2].  Of course,
were  the  wake  amplitude  too  large  or  the  focusing  too
weak,  then  a  correspondingly  larger  focusing/energy
spread is required, as is illustrated in Fig. 2.

2.2  Saturation of Exponential Growth

As shown in Fig. 3, the difference in the patterns of Fig.

1 arises from saturation of the growth factor c( )E.  As 
exceeds  unity,  the  envelope  | [M|  decays  algebraically,
varying as a negative power of M.  The gradual decay of
MBBU  for  >1  is  seen  in  the  bottom  curve  of  Fig.  1.
Thus,  in  suppressing  MBBU,  a  linear  focusing  variation
acts differently from exponential decay that accompanies
a finite deflecting-wake Q.

The bunch train tends to be centered about the steady-
state  displacement  which,  in  the  presence  of  a  focusing
variation,  oscillates  harmonically  with  bunch  number  M.
Consequently,  as  shown  in  Fig.  4,  the  bunch  train  itself
assumes  a  complicated  form.    Because  a  linear  collider
brings bunch trains from two distinct linacs into collision,

the  final-focus  system  must  damp  the  displacements  to
ensure the bunch-to-bunch overlap at the interaction point
is sufficient to achieve the desired multibunch luminosity.
However, Fig. 4 applies to the case Q Â’DORZQ would
simply  leave  a  residual  oscillation  from  any  focusing
variation present; the spread of bunches about the steady-
state curve would be exponentially damped.

Figure 5 depicts the influence  of  a  finite  Q  relative  to
that  of  a  nonzero  energy  spread  |f |.    It  shows  the
displacement |x90-xSS|/x0 of the last bunch M=M=90 at the
linac  exit  plotted  for  various  values  of  Q.    Given  the
parameters in Table 1, the energy spread will be useful in
suppressing MBBU provided |f (%)| > 1000  NQ) =

itself; 

the  displacement 

3,800/Q.    One  can  see  from  Fig.  5  how  this  criterion
manifests 
is  approximately
independent of energy spread until the stated threshold is
exceeded, after which the displacment drops off relatively
fast with increasing |f |.  However, Fig. 5 also shows that
the  displacement 
is  sensitively  dependent  on  Q.
Accordingly,  designing  rf  structures  for  a  linear  collider
involves trading between low deflecting-wake Q and high
shunt impedance of the accelerating mode [3].

3  CONCLUSIONS

 We  discussed  an  analytic  solution  of  the  equation  of
transverse  motion  for  multibunch  beam  breakup  with  a
linear  focusing/energy  variation  across  the  bunch  train.
The solution is, by design, applicable to the main linacs of
linear  colliders.    It  constitutes  a  nontrivial  extrapolation
from  work  done  in  the  early  1990s  wherein  analytic
results  were  derived  for  all  regions  of  linac  parameter
space, but without such BNS damping [4].

 A  key  reward  is  the  ability  to  decipher  the  inherent
parametric  scaling.    We  presented  two  conditions  that
both need to be fulfilled for the focusing/energy variation
to be effective, one relating to linac and beam parameters
separate from the deflecting-wake Q (the " >1 criterion"),
and  the  other  relating  to  Q  explicitly.    With  parameters
representative of a linear collider, a modest energy spread
suffices  to  suppress  MBBU,  a  finding  that  is  consistent
with Stupakovâ€™s simulations of an NLC main linac [2].  Of
course, the focusing/energy variation cannot be arbitrarily
large;  practical  limitations  such  as  longitudinal  beam
requirements at the interaction point, lattice chromaticity,
etc., impose constraints beyond the two that we described.
 The  authors  are  grateful  to  M.  Syphers  and  G.

Stupakov for stimulating discussions.

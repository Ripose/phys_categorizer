We brieﬂy review recent achievements in the theory of neutral particles
(the Majorana-McLennan-Case-Ahluwalia construct for self/anti-self charge
conjugate states for j = 1/2 and j = 1 cases). Among new results we present
a theoretical construct in which a fermion and an antifermion have the same
intrinsic parity; discuss phase transformations and ﬁnd relations between the
Majorana-like ﬁeld operator ν, given by Ahluwalia, and the Dirac ﬁeld op-
erator. Also we give explicit forms of the j = 1 “spinors” in the Majorana
representation.

The construct for self/anti-self charge conjugate states deﬁned in the mo-
mentum representation has been proposed in refs. [1,2]. This is the straight-
forward development of the Majorana ideas [3] and the ideas of McLennan [4]
and Case [5].

Let us present the previous results:

•

Self/anti-self charge conjugate spinors have been deﬁned in the (1/2, 0)
(0, 1/2) representation in the momentum space [1c]:

Similar states (to a certain extent) can be constructed in the higher
representations of the Lorentz group, e.g., in the (j, 0)

tation, j > 1/2.

λ and ρ spinors are not eigenspinors of the parity operator, see formulas
(36a,b) in ref. [1c]. “This is not related to the fact that Sc
[1/2] and
Ss
[1/2] do not commute. Since Sc
[1/2] is not linear, it is possible to have
a simultaneous set of eigenspinors, but such a set does not have its
eigenspinors of type-II”, in the opinion of D. V. Ahluwalia, ref. [1c].

The introduction of the interaction in an usual manner (“covariantiza-
ieAµ) was found to be impossible for these states
tion” ∂µ → ∇µ = ∂µ −
because phase transformations which correspond to this “covariantiza-
tion” would lead to the consequence that the spinors would not keep
their property to be self/anti-self charge conjugate spinors.

Simple dynamical equations for λ and ρ spinors have been obtained [2d]
on the basis of a new form of the Ryder-Burgard relation (which con-
nects the left- and right- parts of the bispinors in the frame with zero
momentum [6,7]). Here they are:

mρA(x) = 0
iγµ∂µλS(x)
−
mλS(x) = 0
iγµ∂µρA(x)

iγµ∂µλA(x) + mρS(x) = 0
iγµ∂µρS(x) + mλA(x) = 0

In fact they can be written in eight-component form, see also the old

The sets of λ spinors and of ρ spinors are claimed [1c] to be bi-
orthonormal sets each in the mathematical sense, provided that overall
phase factors of 2-spinors θ1 + θ2 = 0 or π. For instance, on the classical
level ¯λS
= 2iN 2 cos(θ1 + θ2). Corresponding commutation relations

Several explicit constructs of the Bargmann-Wightman-Wigner-type
theories [13] have been presented in [7,1,2,10].

We continue researches in the area of the physics of neutral particles be-
cause the present-day standard models do not provide any adequate formal-
ism for describing neutrino and photon. Among new results we now present:

the spinors retain their properties to be self/anti-self charge conjugate
spinors and the proposed Lagrangian [2d, p. 1472] remains to be invari-
ant. This tells us that while self/anti-self charge conjugate states has
zero eigenvalues of the ordinary (scalar) charge operator but they can
possess the axial charge (cf. with the discussion of [10] and the old idea
of R. E. Marshak).

In fact, from this consideration one can recover the Feynman-Gell-Mann
equation (and its charge-conjugate equation). It is re-written in the two-

where cα are arbitrary parameters. The τ matrices are deﬁned over
2 matrices1 and the Hermitian conjugation operation
the ﬁeld of 2
is assumed to act on the c- numbers as the complex conjugation. One
can parametrize c0 = cos φ and c = n sin φ and, thus, deﬁne the SU (2)
group of phase transformations. One can select the Lagrangian which is
composed from the both ﬁeld operators (with λ spinors and ρ spinors)
and which remains to be invariant with respect to this kind of trans-
formations. The conclusion is: it is permitted a non-Abelian construct
which is based on the spinors of the Lorentz group only (cf. with the
old ideas of T. W. Kibble and R. Utiyama) . This is not surprising be-
cause both the SU (2) group and U (1) group are the sub-groups of the
extended Poincar´e group (cf. [6]). Another non-Abelian model was pro-
(1/2, 1/2) by T. Barrett (e.g., ref. [15]) and,
posed in the (1, 0)
⊕
recently, in the (1, 0)

(0, 1) representation by J.-P. Vigier et al. [16].

The new construct has been presented in which the fermion and its
antifermion may have the same intrinsic parities [1c,2f]. We can deduce

One can convince ourselves by straightforward veriﬁcation in the cor-
rectness of the assertions made in [1] (see also the old paper [12]) that it
is possible a situation when the operators of the space inversion and the
charge conjugation commute each other in the Fock space. For instance,

But, what is important, the antiparticle states (moving backward in
time) have the same properties with respect to the operation of space
inversion as the corresponding particle states (as opposed to the j = 1/2
Dirac particles). This is again in accordance with the analysis of Nigam
and Foldy [12], and Ahluwalia [1c]. The states which are eigenstates of
the charge conjugation operator in the Fock space are

Furthermore, we have found some connections between the Dirac ﬁeld
operator and the Majorana-like operator composed of λS,A spinors. If
one uses relations (7) between the self/anti-self charge conjugate spinors

thus naturally leading to the Ziino-Barut scheme of massive chiral ﬁelds,
ref. [10].

The conslusion is:
it is still required a lot of work to make certain
conclusions about the relevance of the presented construct to describing
the physical world and to the present situation in the neutrino physics.
But, it is important that this construct is permitted by the requirements
of the extended Poincar´e group symmetry; it is based on the very viable
postulates: in fact, after imposing the coniditions of self/anti-self charge
conjugacy we derived all consequences only on the basis of the Wigner
rules for transformations of left- and right- handed 2-spinors and on the
relations between these spinors in the frame with zero momentum.

Thus, as I was tought in the Gorbachev’s epoch: “everything is permit-
ted unless forbidden”.

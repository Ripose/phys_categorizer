ABSTRACT 

A multi-pixel photon sensor with single-photon sensitivity has been developed.    Based on a hybrid 

photo-detector  (HPD)  technology,  it  consists  of  a  photocathode  and  a  multi-pixel  avalanche  diode 

(MP-AD).    The  developed  HPD  has  a  proximity-focused  structure,  where  the  photocathode  and 

MP-AD face each other with a small gap of 2.5 mm.    The MP-AD, which has an effective area of 

16mm×16mm,  is  composed  of  8×8  pixel  and  has  been  specially  designed  for  the  HPD.    The 

maximum  gain  of  the  HPD  is  5×104,  sufficiently  high  to  detect  single  photons  with  a  timing 

resolution better than 100 ps.    Up to four photoelectrons can be clearly identified as distinct peaks 

in  a  pulse-height  spectrum,  thanks  to  the  low  noise  characteristics  of  the  HPD.    It  is  also

1. Introduction 

 

 

 

 

 

In  particle  physics  experiments,  photon  sensors  have  long  played  a  key  role  in  various  particle 

detectors.    One  of  the  most  interesting  and  attractive  photon  sensors  in  these  days  is  a  hybrid 

photo-detector (HPD).    A HPD can be realized as combination of vacuum-tube technology and the 

rapidly  evolving  semiconductor  technology.    A  photocathode  and  photodiode  are  mounted  facing 

each  other  with  a  small  gap  inside  a  vacuum  tube.    The  photoelectrons  produced  at  the 

photocathode  are  accelerated  across  the  gap  by  a  strong  electric  field  applied  and  impinge  on  the 

photodiode.    The multiplication obtained through this acceleration can be as high as one thousand.   

Thanks to this high gain in the first multiplication stage, statistical fluctuations are so small that very 

clean  photon  counting  is  possible  if  a  reasonable  noise  level  can  be  maintained  in  the  subsequent 

amplification  stages.    For  a  very  fast  application,  however,  it  is  still  difficult  to  preserve  good 

photon counting capability because of the relatively higher noise inherent to a high-speed amplifier.     

This  work  focuses  on  the  development  of  a  new  HPD  equipped  with  a  specially  designed 

multi-pixel  avalanche  diode  (MP-AD)  in  which  fast  secondary  amplification  will  be  achieved 

through an avalanche process with very low noise.    Desirable features of the HPD, which we plan 

to develop, are as follows: 

(cid:122)  Detection of single photons with a time response faster than one nanosecond 

(cid:122)  A good signal-to-noise ratio to enable photon counting 

(cid:122)  A multi-pixel structure with a pixel size of the order of 1 mm2 

(cid:122)  Operability in a magnetic field higher than 1 T. 

In this paper, the construction of the developed HPD as well as its performance is described. 

2. Structure of the HPD 

    A schematic drawing of the developed HPD is shown in Fig. 1.    The primary components of the 

3

HPD are a photocathode, a MP-AD and a vacuum container.    The vacuum container consists of an 

input window, a cylindrical ceramic sidewall and a stem.    The ceramic sidewall has two openings, 

where the input window made of a fiber optic plate (FOP) seals one end, and the ceramic stem seals 

the  other  end  to  make  a  vacuum-tight  structure.    The  FOP  is  made  of  a  bundle  of  optical  fibers 

(6µm φ) aligned to the tube axis so as to transfer an image focused on the front of the input window 

to  the  back  without  any  loss  of  spatial  information.    On  the  vacuum  side  of  the  FOP,  antimony, 

sodium and potassium are evaporated to form a multi-alkali photocathode with an aperture of 25 mm 

in diameter.    The MP-AD is assembled on the stem facing the photocathode with a small distance 

of 2.5 mm to minimize the effect of any external magnetic field.    This proximity focusing structure 

is  essential  for  vacuum  tubes  to  be  used  in  a  high  magnetic  field.    Output  pins  come  out  for 

applying bias voltages or extracting signals in air back-side of the stem. 

    The  MP-AD  is  specifically  designed  for  this  HPD.    Among  the  various  types  of  avalanche 

photodiodes (APD) invented so far [1][2][3][4][5][6], the structure of the MP-AD shown in Fig. 2 

was chosen taking the following points into consideration; 

1) 

tolerance for intense electron bombardment in an HPD, 

2) 

thin dead layer at the entrance, 

3)  applicability to a multi pixel structure, 

4)  ease of fabrication. 

    A  Si  substrate  of  75  µm  thickness  was  used  so  that  full  depletion  may  be  achieved  with  a 

reasonable  operational  bias  voltage,  lower  than  400  V.    Starting  with  a  p  type  substrate,  an  8×8 

array of independent pn junctions, each of which forms a pixel, was fabricated on one surface while 

the  other  surface  was  treated  for  bombardment  by  electrons.    The  pixel  size  of  2mm×2mm  was 

chosen to have a capacitance around 6 pF, which corresponds to a timing response as fast as 1 ns for 

the  HPD.    Since  the  pn  junction  is  shielded  by  the  substrate  from  direct  hits  by  electrons,  no 

damage is expected from electrons, assuring stable operation.    The highly doped p+ layer facing the 

electron flow is also useful to prevent charge accumulation due to electron irradiation.

3. Performance 

3.1    Fundamental performance 

The quantum efficiency (QE) of the photocathode is defined as the photon-to-electron conversion 

efficiency, which is a function of wavelength.    As shown in Fig. 3, the QE of the present HPD is 

measured to be 20% in the UV and blue region while it is 10% or less in the visible region, a typical 

response  for  a  multi-alkali  photocathode.  The  cutoff  wavelength  of  360  nm  is  determined  by  the 

transmission characteristic of the FOP.   

The electron-bombarded gain (EB gain) defined as the ratio of the currents from the MP-AD and 

the photocathode, was measured as a function of the photocathode voltages.    As shown in Fig. 4, 

the  EB  gain  starts  rising  around  a  threshold  voltage  (Vth)  of  -4.0  kV  and  reaches  1270  for  a 

photocathode voltage of -8 kV.    The EB gain (mEB) can be approximated by the following equation: 

m

EB

=

−

( −
VV
E

)

th

, 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

where V is the photocathode voltage, Vth is the threshold voltage, and E is the average energy needed 

to  produce  one  electron-hole  pair.    E  can  be  estimated  from  the  slope  of  the  gain  to  be  3.2  eV.   

This is close to the theoretical value of 3.6 eV for silicon [7].    The threshold energy is thought to be 

determined  by  the  thickness  of  the  dead  layer  at  the  entrance  surface.    The  actual  thickness  was 

evaluated  by  modeling  the  behavior  of  EB  gain  with  the  PENELOPE  [8],  simulation  code  for 

electron/photon transport.    The best fit, shown in Fig. 4, was obtained with a dead layer of 210 nm, 

which  approximately  corresponds  to  the  thickness  of  the  p+  layer.    Disagreement  seen  at  the 

threshold can be attributed to such a simple assumption that any electrons generated in the dead layer 

can  never  reach  the  avalanche  region.    Although  the  p+  layer  is  absolutely  necessary  to  prevent 

thermal  charges  from  flowing  out  as  an  excess  dark  current,  there  is  still  room  to  optimize  its 

5

thickness.    The maximum voltage on the photocathode was limited below 9kV in the present test to 

avoid discharges between the photocathode and AD, which sometimes damages the MP-AD badly. 

Some of the measurements in the early period like the linearity measurement were done with an even 

lower voltage for a safer operation.   

The V-I characteristic, the leakage current of the MP-AD as a function of the reverse bias voltage 

(AD  voltage),  was  measured  in  a  dark  environment.    The  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  5,  where  the 

current  was  summed  from  all  pixels.    It  is  seen  that  full  depletion  is  realized  at  the  kink  around 

100V.     

 

The  avalanche  gains  were  measured  under  continuous  illumination  by  photons  or  electrons  and 

plotted  in  Fig.  6,  where  the  currents  are  normalized  to  those  measured  at  the  AD  voltage  of  1V 

assuming  the  avalanche  gain  to  be  unity  there.    The  solid  line  shows  the  avalanche  gain  for 

illumination  by  photons.    The  dashed  and  the  dotted  lines  illustrate  those  for  electrons  with 

photocathode  voltages  of  -6  kV  and  -9  kV,  respectively.    It  was  found  that  the  avalanche  gain 

showed a slight decrease when the photocathode voltage was increased.    One possible explanation 

is a local space-charge effect at the avalanche multiplication region.    A primary electron from the 

photocathode generates approximately one thousand electrons inside the AD, localized in a volume 

of  several  cubic  microns.    The  localized  charge  compensates  the  electric  field  at  the  avalanche 

region  and,  therefore,  reduces  the  avalanche  gain  significantly.    Since  the  space-charge  effect  is 

quite  localized,  it  does  not  seriously  affect  the  linearity  characteristic  for  counting  of  primary 

photoelectrons.    Good linearity at least up to 230 photoelectrons per pixel was confirmed, as shown 

in Fig. 7.    This was measured by the setup described in section 3.2, where the number of incident 

photons  was  varied  using  neutral  density  filters.    The  total  gain  is  5.0×104  at  the  photocathode 

voltage of –8 kV with 340 V on the MP-AD, just below the threshold of an excessive leakage current.   

No significant deviations from linear response were observed in the reachable range of the present 

measurement.

3.2    Pulse-height spectra 

The  pulse-height  spectra  for  single  photons  were  measured  for  various  photocathode  voltages 

using  a  light  emitting  diode  (LED)  of  470  nm  wavelength  as  a  pulsed  light  source.    The  HPD 

output  signal  was  amplified  by  a  charge  sensitive  amplifier  (ORTEC,  142A  [9]),  further  amplified 

and shaped by a linear amplifier (CANBERRA, 3100-02 [10]), and then analyzed by a multi-channel 

analyzer (Laboratory equipment corp., MCA/AT [11]).    Figure 8 shows the measured pulse-height 

spectra for photocathode voltages of -9 kV (solid), -8 kV (dashed) and -7 kV (dotted), respectively, 

with the AD voltage fixed at 250 V.    The total gains for these conditions were 2.7×104, 2.1×104 or 

1.6×104,  respectively.    The  resolution  (R),  which  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  full  width  at  half 

maximum  (FWHM)  to  the  peak  channel  of  the  spectrum,  improves  with  increasing  photocathode 

voltage, as shown in Fig.8. 

    The improvement of resolution with photocathode voltage can be explained in terms of the energy 

loss of electrons in the dead layer at the entrance surface of the MP-AD.    When electrons from the 

photocathode  lose  a  significant  part  of  their  energy  in  the  dead  layer,  the  energy  detected  in  the 

sensitive  layer  would  experience  large  event-by-event  fluctuations.    Accordingly,  the  EB  gain 

fluctuates.    The  simulation  code,  PENELOPE  [8],  was  used  to  simulate  the  energy  loss  and 

fluctuations in the dead layer.    Based on the result from the EB gain, the thickness of the dead layer 

was assumed to be 210 nm.    The computed fractional energy loss and its fluctuation (in FWHM) to 

the deposited energy in the sensitive layer are shown in Fig. 9.    The energy losses were evaluated to 

be 2.9 keV (41% of the incident energy) at the photocathode voltage of -7 kV, 2.5 keV (31%) at -8 

kV and 2.2 keV (25%) at -9 kV, while the fluctuations (in FWHM) of the energy loss were calculated 

to be 44% at -7 kV, 25% at -8 kV and 18% at -9 kV.    The smaller fluctuation in EB gain for higher 

energy electrons results in better pulse-height resolution. 

7

The pulse-height spectra for single photons were also measured as a function of the AD voltages 

with the photocathode voltage fixed at -8 kV.    The solid, dashed and dotted lines in Fig. 10 show 

spectra for AD voltages of 340V, 312V, and 250V, respectively.    The increase in the peak channel 

with the AD voltage can be simply explained by the increase of the avalanche gain.    The resolution 

is  improved  with  increasing  AD  voltage,  as  shown  in  Fig.  11.    This  may  be  explained  by  the 

behavior of the avalanche gain as a function of EB gain, as shown in Fig. 6.    Events with higher 

(lower)  EB  gain  due  to  fluctuations  tend  to  have  more  (less)  saturation  in  the  avalanche 

multiplication process, and thus produce a relatively lower (higher) gain there.    The compensation 

could be more significant for higher AD voltage.    Accordingly, the overall gain may fluctuate less 

and the pulse-height resolution be better for higher AD voltage.   

Using  the  same  setup,  the  photon  intensity  was  increased  and  the  pulse-height  spectra  for 

multi-photon  signals  were  studied  with  the  maximum  applicable  voltages  to  the  AD  (340V)  and 

photocathode (-9kV).    As  shown  in  Fig. 12,  the peaks corresponding  to  1  to 4 photoelectrons  are 

clearly identified.    This demonstrates the low noise characteristics of the developed HPD. 

3.3    Time response 

The time response for single photons was measured with an oscilloscope in the averaging mode. 

The  LED  light  intensity  was  set  to  be  single-photon  level.    The  HPD  was  operated  at  a  gain  of 

4.2×104  with  moderate  voltages  on  the  photocathode  and  the  AD  of  –8kV  and 325V,  respectively.   

The  time  response  of  the  HPD  was  found  insensitive  to  the  variation  of  the  voltage  on  the 

photocathode  or  on  the  AD  in  the  range  of  250V  to  340V.  A  high-speed  amplifier  (Miteq, 

AU-1494-300, 300 MHz, Gain: 60 dB [12]) was used to amplify the output signal from the HPD.   

The  captured  trace  as  displayed  in  Fig.  13  yielded  rise  and  decay  times  of  1.1  ns  and  1.3  ns, 

respectively. The noise level was measured to be 13 mV in rms with the oscilloscope in the real time 

mode, which should be compared with a single photon signal amplitude of 240mV.    The signal to 

 

 

 

 

8

noise ratio (S/N) is thus calculated to be as high as 18 for a single photon detection.    This low noise 

characteristic and the high speed response have never been achieved by any standard HPD without 

avalanche gain.     

    The timing resolution for a single photon was then measured with a pulsed laser diode (LD), with 

a  pulse  width  of  67  ps  in  FWHM  and  a  wavelength  of  405  nm.    After  a  two-stage  amplification 

(Miteq: AU-1494-300 [12] and HP8447F: 1.5 GHz [13]), the output signal from the HPD was fed to 

a  constant  fraction  discriminator  (CFD,  ORTEC  583  [9])  to  generate  the  start  signal  for  a 

time-to-amplitude  converter  (TAC,  ORTEC  547  [9]).    The  trigger  signal  from  the  LD  driver  was 

used as the stop signal of the TAC.    The TAC output was recorded by the MCA.    The distribution 

of  measured  time  intervals  at  the  gain  of  5.7×104  is  shown  as  open  circles  in  Fig.  14.    By  fitting 

with a Gaussian function (solid curve), the timing resolution for a single photon is estimated to be 80 

ps  including  the  timing  jitter  of  the  measurement  system  (26  ps)  and  light  pulse  (29  ps).    The 

resolutions at lower gain are also measured to be 97 ps (4.7×104) and 104 ps (4.2×104), confirming 

the  dependence  of  the  timing  resolution  upon  the  gain  of  the  HPD,  as  discussed  in  [14].  The 

resolution  is  compatible  with  that  of  the  transit  time  spread  (TTS)  of  commercially  available  fast 

PMTs.     

3.4    Performance as a multi-pixel photon sensor 

As  a  multi-pixel  device,  uniformity,  cross-talk  and  response  at  the  pixel  boundary  were 

investigated  in  detail.    The  uniformity  over  the  HPD  was  measured  by  scanning  the  light  spot  of 

0.94 mm in diameter focused on the center of every pixel.    The wavelength of the light was chosen 

to  be  500  nm.    The  HPD  was  operated  at  a  gain  of  4.2×104  with  moderate  voltages  on  the 

photocathode and the AD of –8kV and 325V, respectively.    This operational condition was used for 

the  measurements  hereafter.    The  relative  amplitude  of  the  measured  output  from  each  pixel  is 

plotted in Fig. 15.    The standard deviation of the relative gains among the 64 pixels was found to be 

 

 

 

 

9

7.9%  with  respect  to  the  average  one,  and  the  smallest  output  was  75%  of  the  largest.    This 

uniformity is better than that of 30% as reported for a multi-anode PMT commercially available in 

the market [15]. 

    To identify the source of the non-uniformity, further investigations on the photocathode sensitivity 

and EB gain were made.    To measure the photocathode sensitivity, the cathode and anode of the AD 

were  short-circuited,  and  the  HPD  was  operated  as  a  kind  of  phototube.    With  -1  kV  on  the 

photocathode, the output current was measured.    To examine the uniformity of EB gain, the HPD 

was  operated  with  a  unit  avalanche  gain  in  the  AD  and  its  output  was  normalized  by  the 

photocathode  sensitivity  measured  above.    As  a  result,  the  non-uniformity  in  the  photocathode 

sensitivity and EB gain are measured to be as small as 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively, which can not 

account  for  the  observed  overall  non-uniformity.    The  uniformity  in  the  avalanche  gain  was 

evaluated by dividing the HPD output under normal conditions by the output with the unity gain in 

the  avalanche  diode.    As  seen  in  Fig.  16,  the  overall  gain  is  fully  correlated  with  that  of  the 

avalanche diode.    It can be concluded that the non-uniformity of the HPD is dominated by that of 

avalanche multiplication in the MP-AD.    This can be attributed to a slight gradient in the impurity 

density in the p layer facing the n+ layer.    The prior test with the prototype AD shows that a 2% 

decrease  in  impurity  density  reduced  the  avalanche  by  a  factor  of  2  because  of  the  lower  electric 

field in the avalanche region.     

 

The  cross-talk  behavior  between  pixels  was  studied  under  continuous  illumination  focused  onto 

the center of a single pixel with a spot size of 0.94 mm.    The output currents observed on the other 

pixels  were  measured  as  shown  in  Fig.17.    It  is  seen  that  the  cross-talk  into  the  adjacent  pixel  is 

1.3% while it is much smaller for the others.    Some of the cross-talk is considered to come from the 

light scattering in the FOP.    The electrons backscattered at the MP-AD also contribute, as discussed 

later.   

 

 

 

10

The  cross-talk  between  pixels  under  pulsed  light  was  also  investigated.    A  spot  of  pulsed  light 

was focused onto the center of pixels, and the output charge appearing on other pixels was measured 

by  a  charge-sensitive  amplifier  (ORTEC  142A  [9]).    As  shown  in  Fig.  18,  the  cross-talk 

characteristic  was  almost  the  same  as  that  observed  under  continuous  illumination,  except  for  two 

neighboring  pixels  (pixels  (5,  6)  and  (5,  7))  whose  signal  due  to  cross-talk  was  found  to  be 

approximately 6%.    The latter can be attributed to capacitive coupling among the signal traces on 

the  AD,  where  they  run  side-by-side  with  a  separation  of  0.2  mm.    This  also  explains  why  the 

cross-talk  to  pixel  (5,3)  or  (5,4)  was  small,  whose  signal  trace  runs  toward  the  opposite  direction. 

The cross-talk can be reduced by modifying the signal traces to have larger separation.   

The gain characteristic at the edge of the pixel was examined by scanning across the boundary of 

two adjacent pixels with a light spot of 30 µm diameter.    As shown in Fig. 19, there is a low gain 

zone 120 µm wide where the gain falls less than 50% of that in the center of the pixel.    The dashed 

line  drawn  in the  figure indicates  the  expectation  assuming  both  a  low  gain  zone  of 120 µm  wide 

with 25% gain and finite size of the irradiated light spot.   

3.5    Operation in a strong magnetic field 

Several  characteristics  of  the  HPD  were  also  measured  in  a  magnetic  field.    The  input  FOP 

window was masked to leave an opening of 1.0mm×1.2mm to restrict the illumination from the LED 

(470 nm) onto a single pixel.    The HPD was placed inside the electromagnet, aligning its axis at 0o 

and 30o with respect to the magnetic field direction.    The output current from the illuminated pixel 

and  an  adjacent  one  were  monitored  while  changing  the  field  strength  from  0  to  1.5  T.    The 

experimental configuration is illustrated in Fig. 20. 

The output signal observed in the illuminated pixel and the adjacent one are plotted in Fig. 21 as a 

function of the field strength.    It is seen that the output in the illuminated pixel increases by 10 % 

 

 

 

 

 

11

from  0.1T  to  0.6  T,  while  that  in  the  adjacent  pixel  decreases  from  1.4  %  to  0.8%.    This  can  be 

understood as re-entry of backscattered electrons onto the illuminated pixel under a strong magnetic 

field.    These electrons would otherwise be distributed to adjacent pixels and produce the substantial 

cross-talk  signal  reported  in  the  previous  section.    The  amount  of  distributed  charge  over  the  24 

surrounding pixels can account for the 10% loss in the illuminated pixel at zero field. 

    Where  the  magnetic  field  was  inclined  by  30  o  to  the  tube  axis,  the  output  current  from  the 

illuminated  pixel  rapidly  decreased  with  the  field  strength,  while  a  corresponding  increase  was 

observed  in  the  adjacent  pixel.    This  can  be  explained  by  a  Lorenz  shift  of  the  trajectory  of 

photoelectrons.    A calculation of the trajectory in the magnetic field shows that the position of the 

electrons  on  the  MP-AD  is  shifted  by  1.43  mm  for  a  magnetic  field  higher  than  0.5  T  so  that  the

In order to demonstrate the capability of the HPD in a particle detector, it was integrated with a 

bundle  of  scintillating  fibers  (Kuraray  SCSF-78M,  0.7mmφ),  which  was  directly  connected  to  the 

FOP window of the HPD.    The peak wavelength in the emission spectrum of the fibers was 430 nm.   

The  length  of  the  fiber bundle  was 200 mm  and  the cross  section was  formed  to 16mm×16mm  to 

match the effective area of the HPD.    A mirror was put on the open end of the scintillating fibers to 

reflect photons towards the HPD.    The applied voltages were -8 kV on the photocathode and 315 V 

on the AD for the gain of 3.8×104.    All 64 pixels of the HPD were connected to readout circuits, 

which consisted of a 64 input front-end chip (IDE, VA32_HDR2 [16]) with a shaping time of 1µs, 

control circuitry and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) board (National instruments, PCI-6111E 

[17])  mounted  on a personal  computer.    The  lower AD  voltage  was  chosen  to  reduce  the  leakage 

current flowing into the multi-channel front-end chip connected directly to the AD outputs.

Cosmic-ray tracks were recorded with this system, as shown in Fig. 22, where the shading in the 

squares correspond to the number of photoelectrons detected in the pixels.    The average number of 

photoelectrons per pixel is estimated to be 17.    This may be compared with the expectation of 7.4 

photoelectrons  deduced  from  the  past  measurement  [18],  where  the  significantly  longer  fibers 

(3700mm) were used.    It is also seen that the noise level is well below that of a single photoelectron.   

Thus, it is demonstrated that the HPD developed in the present study is realistically applicable for 

photon-counting in particle detectors. 

5.    Summary and future prospect 

We have successfully developed a new type of HPD which is composed of a photocathode and a 

multi-pixel avalanche photodiode (MP-AD) specifically designed for this application.    The overall 

gain as high as 5×104 was achieved with a timing resolution of 80 ps for a single photon.    This high 

gain  and  precise  timing  resolution  have  been  achieved  for  the  first  time  in  an  HPD  thanks  to  a 

suitably designed MP-AD.    The pixel-to-pixel non-uniformity in the sensitivity was found to be as 

small as 8 %, which is substantially better than that of any multi-anode PMTs that are commercially 

available.    The new HPD also shows reasonable performance in a magnetic field as high as 1.5 T.   

The  HPD  was  applied  to  particle  tracking  in  conjunction  with  a  scintillating  fiber  array,  and 

cosmic-ray tracks were observed with good signal to noise ratio.   

There are still some aspects, which can be further improved.    One is the arrangement of pixels.   

The technology for an MP-AD developed in this study can be adapted to various applications with 

simple  geometric  modifications.    A  pixel  arrangement  with  32×32  pixel  in  the  same  area  of 

16mm×16 mm exists, although the low gain zone between pixels is not negligible (0.1mm wide) in 

the present prototype.    Reduction of the low gain zone should be investigated further by optimizing 

the inter pixel structure of the avalanche region.    The effective area of the current HPD is limited by 

the size of the vacuum container, which is optimized for a photocathode diameter of 25 mm.    The 

13

 

 

 

 

MP-AD was designed to match the size of the photocathode.    It is technically possible to apply a 

larger AD  for  a larger  vacuum  container.    A  number  of  output  pins  may  limit  a number  of  pixels 

less  than  100  for  realizing  a  stem.    In  the  case  of  more  than  100  pixels,  it  is  preferable  to 

encapsulate a chip for multiplexing output signals from an MP-AD. 

A proximity focused HPD that is less sensitive to magnetic fields may be constructed by reducing 

the  distance  between  the  photocathode  and  the  MP-AD.    In  this  case,  it  is  necessary  to  avoid 

voltage breakdown in the higher electric field due to the reduced distance between the photocathode 

and  the  MP-AD.    One  possible  solution  is  a  thinner  dead  layer  of  the  entrance  surface  of  the 

MP-AD so as to generate the same EB gain with a lower voltage to the photocathode. 

The  other  aspect  to  be  improved  is  the  drastic  enlargement  of  the  effective  area  by  using  an 

electrostatically  focusing  lens.    In  this  case,  electrons  from  a  large-area  photocathode  are 

demagnified and focused onto an MP-AD by an electron lens.

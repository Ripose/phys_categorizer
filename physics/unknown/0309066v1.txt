Strong RF Focusing for Luminosity Increase

A. Gallo, P. Raimondi and M. Zobov

1. Introduction

The minimum value of the vertical beta-function  β

y at the IP in a collider is set by the
hourglass  effect  [1]  and  it  is  almost  equal  to  the  bunch  length  σ
z.  Reduction  of  the  bunch
length is an obvious approach to increase the luminosity. By scaling the horizontal and vertical
beta functions  β
remain unchanged while the luminosity scales as 1 σ

y at the IP as the bunch length  σ
z  [2]:

A  natural  way  to  decrease  the  bunch  length  is  to  decrease  the  storage  ring  momentum
compaction and/or to increase the RF voltage. However, in such a way we cannot obtain very
short  bunches  since  the  short-range  wakefields  prevent  this  because  of  the  potential  well
distortion and microwave instability.

In  this  paper  we  consider  an  alternative  strategy  to  get  short  bunches  at  the  IP.  In
particular,  we  propose  to  use  strong  RF  focusing  [3]  (with  high  RF  voltage  and  high
momentum  compaction)  to  obtain  very  short  bunches  at  the  IP  with  progressive  bunch
elongation toward the RF cavity.
With respect to the case of short bunches with constant length all along the ring, the situation
seems more comfortable since the average charge density driving the Touschek scattering is
smaller. Besides, this allows placing the most important impedance generating devices near the
RF cavity where the bunch is longest thus minimizing the effect of the wakefields.

2. Strong RF Focusing

In order to compress the bunch at the IP in a collider a strong RF focusing can be applied.
For  this  purpose  high  values  of  the  momentum  compaction  factor  α
c   and  extremely  high
values  of  the  RF  gradient  are  required.  It  is  estimated  that,  for  a  Φ-factory collider, an RF
voltage  VRF  of  the  order  of  10  MV  is  necessary  provided  that  the  α
c   value  is  of  the  order
of 0.2.

Under these conditions the synchrotron tune  ν

s grows to values larger than 0.1 and the
commonly  used  "smooth  approximation"  in  the  analysis  of  the  longitudinal  dynamics  is  no
longer valid. Instead, the longitudinal dynamics is much more similar to the transverse one, and
can be analyzed on the base of the simple linear model reported in Fig. 1 and of its transfer
matrices. In this model the cavity behaves like a thin focusing lens in the longitudinal phase

As  µ approaches 180°, the ratio between the bunch lengths at the IP and at the RF goes to
zero. This result is of great interest since it allows designing a ring where the bunch is short at
the IP and progressively elongates moving toward the RF position.

3. Equilibrium Energy spread

In  order  to  compute  exactly  the  bunch  size  along  the  ring  one  needs  to  know  the
longitudinal  emittance  value  (or,  equivalently,  the  value  of  the  equilibrium  energy  spread).
These  values  can  be  worked  out  from  a  rigorous  analysis  of  the  longitudinal  dynamics
(abandoning the smooth approximation) or from a multi-particle tracking simulation including
the distributed emission process along the machine. We follow an analytical approach based on
the  computation  of  the  second  momenta  of  the  bunch  equilibrium  distributions  using  the
eigenvectors of the longitudinal one-turn transfer matrix [4] that gives the following result:

As it is seen, the longitudinal emittance exhibits a minimum at  µ=

120 . The analogy with
the transverse case is quite evident [6]. Being the momentum compaction fixed, the various
phase  advances  correspond  to  different  values  of  the  RF  voltages.  The  voltage  required  to
approach the limit phase advance value of  180° exceeds 10 MV. The use of superconducting
cavities is mandatory in this case.

4. Conclusions

In  this  paper  the  motion  of  particles  in  a  strong  longitudinal  focusing  storage  ring  is
described  by  means  of  the  linear  matrices  formalism.  Longitudinal  optical  functions  are
derived, showing that the bunch length varies along the ring and may be minimized at the IP.
Analytical  expressions  for  the  longitudinal  emittance  and  the  energy  spread  of  the  bunch
equilibrium  distribution  have  been  obtained  and  validated  by  comparison  with  results  from
multiparticle tracking simulations. It has been shown that the longitudinal emittance and the
energy spread, as well as the bunch length at the RF cavity position diverge as the synchrotron
phase advance approaches 180° per turn, while the bunch length at the IP tends to a minimum
value which is finite.

Many aspects of beam physics need to be studied to establish whether or not a collider
may efficiently work in the strong longitudinal focusing regime. The most relevant issues are
bunch lengthening due to the wakefields, Touschek lifetime, dynamic aperture and beam-beam
effect. Very preliminary multiparticle tracking simulations based on the DAFNE short range
wake show that the short bunch length at the IP can be preserved up to relatively high bunch
current (> 10 mA) provided that all the wake is concentrated near the RF cavity, the position
where the bunch is longest.

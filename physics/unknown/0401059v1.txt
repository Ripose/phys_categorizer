Abstract

Time-resolved  transient  absorption  spectroscopy  has  been  used  to  study

nanosecond  and  sub-microsecond  electron  dynamics  in  aqueous  anatase  nanoparticles

(pH=3-4, 4.6 nm diameter) in the presence of hole scavengers: chemisorbed polyols and

carbohydrates. These polyhydroxylated compounds are rapidly oxidized by the holes; 50-

60%  of  these  holes  are  scavenged  within  the  duration  of  3.3  ns  FWHM,  355  nm

excitation laser pulse. The scavenging efficiency rapidly increases with the number of

anchoring  hydroxyl  groups  and  varies  considerably  as  a  function  of  the  carbohydrate

structure.  A  specific  binding  site  for  the  polyols  and  carbohydrates  is  suggested  that

involves an octahedral Ti atom chelated by the –CH2(OH)-CH2(OH)- ligand. This mode

of  binding  accounts  for  the  depletion  of  undercoordinated  Ti  atoms  observed  in  the

XANES spectra of polyol coated nanoparticles. We suggest that these binding sites trap a

substantial fraction of holes before the latter descend to surface traps and/or recombine

with free electrons. The resulting oxygen hole center rapidly loses a CH proton to the

environment, yielding a metastable C-centered radical.

1. Introduction.

Aqueous anatase (TiO2) nanoparticles find numerous applications in photovoltaics

and photocatalysis (e.g., [1,2]). Photoexcitation of the nanoparticles yields electron-hole

pairs that rapidly recombine [3-7]; this recombination competes with trapping of the free

charges by coordination defects at the nanoparticle surface and lattice defects in the bulk.

In this work, we report rapid, efficient scavenging of the holes by polyhydroxyl alcohols

and sugars that are chemisorbed at the nanoparticle surface.

It is known from the previous studies that photoexcitation of TiO2 nanoparticles

yields at least two kinds of (surface-)trapped holes [8-11], although their exact structure

is uncertain. According to EPR [8], both of the hole centers are O  2p radicals, such as
TiIV-O• [8] and adsorbed hydroxyl radical, OHads [9]. According to Ishibashi et al. [11],

the quantum yield for photogeneration of OHads is small (ca 0.7% of that for the iodide-

oxidizing hole), however, this radical species is very important for photocatalysis, as it is

more reactive towards hydrogen donors, such as monohydroxyl alcohols, than other hole

centers.  For  example,  Gao  et  al.  demonstrated  that  only  OHads  oxidizes  methanol  in

aqueous TiO2 solutions [10], whereas the predominant oxygen hole center is unreactive

towards this substrate and decays via recombination with the electron [12]. Importantly,

this  conclusion  pertains  to  aqueous  solutions  of  the  nanoparticles  only  since  time-

resolved IR studies of Yamakata at al. [13,14] showed that at the rutile surface exposed to

methanol and 2-propanol vapor in vaccum, the holes are scavenged in less than 50 ns,

which was the time resolution of their setup. On the other hand, it has been observed that

certain  polyhydroxylated  aliphatic  compounds,  such  as  polyvinyl  alcohol,  are  very

efficient hole scavengers for TiO2 nanoparticles in an aqueous solution (e.g., [15,16]).

In this work, photooxidation of polyols and sugars by aqueous photoexcited TiO2

nanoparticles is studied in a systematic fashion. To this end, nanosecond dynamics of

near-IR  absorbance  from  trapped  electron  were  observed  following  355  nm  laser

photoexcitation  of  the  TiO2  nanoparticle  solution.  Upon  the  addition  of  polyhydroxyl

alcohols  and  carbohydrates  to  the  reaction  mixture,  the  survival  probability  of  the

electron  increases  five-fold  since  scavenging  of  the  hole  prevents  the  decay  of  the

electron via recombination, as the radical product of the scavenging reaction does not

recombine with the electron. As shown below, the increase in the survival probability

3

follows  the  Langmuir-Hinshelwood  law.  The  corresponding  scavenging  constant

uniquely  characterizes  each  hole  scavenger,  changing  with  the  number  of  hydroxyl

groups and the carbohydrate structure.

2. Experimental.

Transient absorbance ∆OD900 from the electron was observed following 355 nm
laser  photoexcitation  of  oxygen-saturated  2.4x10-4  M  aqueous  solution  of  46±5  Å

diameter anatase nanoparticles (1400 units of TiO2 per particle) at pH=4. This solution

was  prepared  as  described  in  ref.  [2]  and  then  aged  for  a  year.  The  particle  size  and

crystallinity  were  characterized  by  TEM [2].  Polyhydroxyl  alcohols  and  sugars  of  the

highest available purity were obtained from Aldrich and used as received.

The 355 nm, 3.3 ns FWHM, laser pulse was derived from the third harmonic of a

Nd:YAG  laser  (Quantel  Brilliant).  This  laser  beam  was  reflected  off  extra  355  nm

dielectric mirrors to remove the traces of the 1st and 2nd harmonic and expanded using a

negative lens (f=-10 cm) away from the optical cell to uniformly irradiate the cell window

masked using a 5.6 mm diameter round aperture. The typical fluence of 355 nm photons
through this aperture was 0.05 J/cm2. The analyzing light from a superpulsed Xe arc lamp
was passed through a 4 cm water cuvette (not used for > 1 µm detection) followed by a 2-

64 glass filter (KOPP, > 650 nm), and then crossed at 45o with the 355 nm laser beam

inside  a  1.35  mm  optical  path  flow  cell  with  suprasil  windows.  The  OD  of  the

photolysate at 355 nm was 0.8. The transmitted light was focussed, passed through a 3-66

glass  filter  (KOPP,  >  560  nm)  and  a  grating  monochromator  (SPEX  Minimate).  For
detection  at  1-1.35  µm,  a  set  of  narrowband  (10  nm  FWHM)  interference  filters
incremented  in  50  nm  steps  was  used.  For  the  detection  near  1.05  µm,  a  0o dielectric

mirror reflecting at 1064 nm was inserted before the detector to beat down the leaking

first  harmonic  of  the  Nd:YAG  laser.  A  fast  Si  photodiode  (EG&G  model  FND100Q)
biased at -100 V was used to detect the transient absorbance at wavelength < 1.1 µm. For
detection at wavelength > 1.1 µm, a Ge photodiode (Germanium Power model GMP566)

biased at -10 V or a fast InGaAs photodiode (Germanium Power model GAP520) biased

at -5 V were used. The photodiode signal was amplified 10 times using a 1.2 GHz opamp

(Comlinear  model  CLC100)  and  sampled  using  a  200  MHz  Tektronix  TD360  digital

4

oscilloscope  or  a  1  GHz  Tektronix  DSA-601  digital  signal  analyzer.  The  laser  pulse

profile was determined using a 1.2 GHz Si photodiode (Hamamtsu model S5792) biased

at –12 V. The overall response time of the detection system was ca. 3 ns (for the 350

MHz FND100Q photodiode and 400 MHz bandwidth of the sampler). Absorption signals
as  small  as  100  µOD  can  be  studied  with  this  setup.  Light  emission  from  the  sample

induced by the 355 nm light (which was very minor > 700 nm) was subtracted from the

absorbance signal. Typically 8 series of 6 pulses were averaged to obtain the kinetics.

To  prevent  the  buildup  of  permanent  electron  absorbance  during  the  laser

photolysis of the polyol solutions, the sample was saturated with oxygen and flowed at
1.5 cm3/min during the photolysis (the repetition rate of the laser was 1-2 Hz). A syringe
driver  was  used  to  flow  10-20  cm3  of  the  sample  during  the  measurement;  after  the

measurement, the sample was pushed back into the syringe using the excess pressure of

the gas, bubbled with oxygen, and reused. No change in the kinetics after 50 such cycles

were  observed,  with  or  without  the  hole  scavenger.  Control  experiments  using  N2-

saturated solutions (with no polyols) showed that oxygen does not react with the electron

on the microsecond scale (as known from other kinetic measurements [15]), i.e., its only

function is to oxidize the electrons between the consecutive laser shots.

Titanium  K-edge  XANES  spectra  were  obtained  using  the  APS  facility  at

Argonne. The details of the experiment and the analysis are given in refs. [2] and [18].

3. Results.

3.1. Transient absorption spectroscopy and scavenging dynamics.

The typical kinetics of transient 900 nm absorbance in photoexcited aqueous TiO2

nanoparticles  are  shown  in  Fig.  1a,c  (trace  (i)).  Only  trapped  electron  absorbs  at  this
wavelength [3,15,18-20]. Assuming the molar absorptivity of 700±50 M-1 cm-1 for these

electrons at 800 nm [19], ca. 1-1.2 electron-hole pairs per nanoparticle were present in
the reaction mixture at the end of 40 mJ/cm2 excitation pulse (t=0+). The quantum yield
for the electron, as determined from the prompt absorption signal at t=0+, was ≈0.2, i.e.,

the  recombination  within  the  excitation  pulse  was  relatively  inefficient  (near-unity

quantum  yield  is  commonly  assumed  for  the  initial  charge  separation  [5,12]).  The

observed  quantum  yield  can  be  compared  with  the  limiting  quantum  yields  for  I2

-

formation  in  aqueous  TiO2  solutions  containing  iodide  (an  efficient  hole  scavenger)

obtained by other workers: 0.16 [21], 0.42 [16], 0.2 [22], and 0.9 [12]. The latter estimate
of 0.9 was obtained at very low fluence of the excitation photons (< 10-9 Einstein/cm2);
under irradiation conditions similar to ours (10-7 Einstein/cm2)  the  quantum  yield  was
substantially lower (0.3 for 3x10-8 Einstein/cm2) [12].

The  low-density  regime  explored  in  this  study  is  different  from  most  of  the

previous  laser  spectroscopy  studies  (including  all  of  the  ultrafast  studies  of  bare  TiO2

nanoparticles, e.g. [5,6,7]), in which 10-100 (sometimes, > 1000 [5]) electron-hole pairs

were  generated  per  nanoparticle.  At  such  high  generation  rates,  the  recombination  of

trapped electrons and holes occurs on the picosecond time scale, and only a small fraction

of the initially generated pairs survives into the nanosecond regime.

Even though the recombination was slowed down due to the low charge density,

>  80%  of  the  electrons  decayed  in  less  than  100  ns,  by  intraparticle,  single-pair

recombination. A small fraction of these electrons decays on a slower time scale, over

many  decades  in  time  (to  at  least  1  ms),  exhibiting  a  dispersive,  power  law  kinetics

typical  of  recombination  of  trapped  charges  in  disordered  semiconductors  [23]  and

nanoparticle surfaces [24]. In particular, the "tail" of kinetics shown in Fig. 1c follows
( ) ∝ −
  α  for  delay  times  between  70  ns  and  10  µ s,  with  α≈0.46.  This
∆OD900 t
t
 

recombination becomes faster on a shorter time scale (Fig. 1c). Between 5 and 300 ns,

this kinetic trace can be approximated by a sum of two exponentials with time constants

of  6.5  and  73  ns  (these  time  constants  slightly  vary  with  the  laser  fluence).  Since  the

duration of the 355 nm excitation pulse (3.3 ns FWHM) is shorter than either one of the

time  constants,  relatively  few  (trapped)  electrons  decay  within  the  duration  of  the

excitation pulse, i.e., the latter integrates over the entire population of these electrons. As

there is little decrease in ∆OD900 per decade of time once the power law regime takes
over, the ratio of the t=300-350 ns absorbance and the prompt absorbance at t=0+ was

considered as a fraction of the electrons that "escape" the recombination with the hole on

the sub-microsecond time scale.

Qualitatively,  the  spectral  and  kinetic  changes  observed  upon  the  addition  of

polyols  (C2-C6)  and  carbohydrates  to  the  nanoparticle  solution  do  not  depend  on  the

scavenger structure and closely resemble those observed in ref. [25] for glycerol (C3). We

6

address the reader to that work for more detail, as it provides more justification for the

analyses described below. It is shown therein that glycerol promptly (< 5 ns) reacts with

40-50% of vis-light-absorbing trapped holes at the nanoparticle surface. Over the first

100 ns, glycerol reacts with most of these light-absorbing holes (not all of these holes are

capable of reacting with glycerol on the microsecond time scale); the inferred absorption

spectrum  of  these  holes  resembles  the  one  observed  in  photoexcited  platinized  TiO2

nanoparticles by Bahnemann et al. [17]. The progress of this “slow” hole scavenging can

be observed directly from the decay of transient absorbance from the hole at 400-700 nm

and the reduction in the bleaching of the 400-900 nm absorbance caused by 532 and 1064

nm  laser  excitation  of  trapped  electrons  (that  causes  their  detrapping  and  rapid

recombination with the holes) [25]. This “slow” hole scavenging (with time constant of

70-100 ns) contributes marginally to the buildup of the electron absorbance in the near-IR

because it is much slower than the charge recombination; i.e., most holes which are not

scavenged  promptly  decay  by  recombination  with  the  electron  rather  than  the  “slow”

reaction with the glycerol. Importantly, the kinetic changes observed at 900 nm in the

presence of glycerol cannot be explained by a change in the light absorption properties of

the electron due to the surface modification of the nanoparticle [25]. In particular, the

800-1350 nm spectra obtained from the aqueous and glycerol-containing solutions are

identical; also, the overall spectra from the glycerol solutions are the same as those of the

electrons  generated  in  aqueous  TiO2  solution  under  the  conditions  that  exclude  the

formation  of  holes  on  the  nanoparticles,  e.g.,  by  electrochemical  reduction  of

nanocrystalline TiO2 films [20], pulse radiolysis [19], and flash photolysis [4] (of acidic

and basic nanoparticle solutions, respectively). Using appropriate weighting coeffcients

for  the  electron  and  hole  spectra,  it  is  possible  to  reproduce  all  intermediate  transient

absorption spectra, for all glycerol concentrations, at any delay time [25].

is the fraction of the scavenged holes, and Kh is the scavenging efficiency (Table 1). The

same behavior was observed for all wavelengths between 800 and 1350 nm, i.e. across

the  entire  spectral  region  where  only  trapped  electron  absorbs.  Note  that  the  time

evolution of IR absorbance from electrons at rutile surfaces exposed to methanol and 2-

propanol vapor follows the same phenomenology as that given by eq. (1) [13,14].

The empirical formula (1) posits that 900 nm kinetics observed in the presence of

a polyol is given by a weighted sum of (i) a flat kinetics and (ii) the kinetics obtained for

c=0  (trace  (i)  in  Fig.  1a),  with  the  weighting  coefficients  chosen  so  that  the  prompt

seen from Fig. 1a). The flat kinetics originates from the TiO2 nanoparticles in which the

hole is scavenged by the polyol (the radical product of the oxidation does not react with

the  electron),  whereas  the  kinetics  whose  time  profile  is  given  by  the  scaled  trace  (i)

originates  from  the  TiO2  nanoparticles  that  still  contains  an  oxygen  hole  center.  To

0 to 1.8 M D-arabitol (C5) were normalized at the maximum (Figs. 1b). It is seen from

Fig. 1b that these normalized kinetics are very similar. This similarity indicates that all of

the holes that can be scavenged by the polyols are scavenged within the duration of the

excitation  laser  pulse.  Observe  that  even  at  the  highest  concentration  of  the  hole

scavenger,  the  fraction  of  the  electrons  that  survive  the  recombination  and  persist  at

longer  delay  times  is  50-60%  (Fig.  1a).  Rapid  as  it  is,  the  hole  scavenging  cannot

outcompete electron-hole recombination occurring on the short time scale [3,5,6,7].

Since  the  prompt  900-1350  nm  absorbance  increases  by  less  than  2-5%  in  the

presence of the hole scavenger, even at very high concentration of the latter, two-electron

oxidation of the polyols is unlikely, at least on the nanosecond time scale. The product of

the hole scavenging reaction is a C-centered radical. Some of these radicals, e.g. CH2OH

and CH(CH3)2OH, are known to “inject” electron into the TiO2 nanoparticles, albeit at a

very  slow  rate  [26].  While  the  “injection”  that  involves  radicals  in  the  water  bulk  is

prohibitively slow (bimolecular rate constants, in terms of nanoparticle concentration, are
2x105 and 3x106 M-1 s-1 for hydroxymethyl and propan-2-olyl, respectively; see Table 4

8

in  ref. [26]), physisorbed radicals formed in the course of hole scavenging could have

reacted  faster,  and  rapid  two-electron  oxidation  is,  in  principle,  possible.  However,  in

such a case, the prompt electron yield would increase in the presence of the scavenger,

following the conversion of the holes to electrons. Since such an increase is not observed

(Fig. 1a), the prompt two-electron oxidation is not supported by our data. Furthermore,
since the decay kinetics of the electron absorbance for t>0+ obey eq. (1) and no growth

component due to the delayed conversion of the holes to electrons is apparent, electron

injection on the submicrosecond time scale is also ruled out. Once the hole is scavenged

by a polyol, the radical product of this reaction neither injects an electron back to the

nanoparticle nor recombines with an electron present on the same nanoparticle (on the

time scale of our experiment).

This conclusion is in accord with the time-resolved IR study by Yamakata et al.

[14] who observed the evolution of electron and C=O stretch absorbances in the laser

excitation of the rutile surface exposed to 2-propanol vapor. Whereas the change in the

electron decay kinetics (due to hole scavenging) was instantaneous (< 50 ns) [13,14], the
C=O  signal  from  acetone  at  1700  cm-1 appeared very slowly, with a half life of 50 µs

(Fig. 3 in ref. 14). Importantly, it was observed that (i) the prompt electron absorbance

did  not  change  significantly  with  the  vapor  pressure  (Fig.  1  in  ref.  14),  whereas  the

survival probability was pressure-dependent, and (ii) the hole scavenging was not 100%

efficient even at the high vapor pressure. Thus, the polyols adsorbed at the surface of

aqueous anatase nanoparticles scavenge holes in much the same way as monohydroxyl

alcohols  adsorbed  at  the  rutile  surface  in  the  gas  phase.  Furthermore,  much  the  same

evolution  of  the  kinetic  traces  was  observed  in  hole  scavenging  by  iodide  [12]  and
thiocyanate [6,17] (on the time scale from 5 ps to 10 µs).

hole scavenger. All these dependencies may be approximated by the Stern-Volmer law,

and the scavenging constants Kh thus obtained are given in Table 1. Scheme 1 gives the

structure of the sugars.

9

Whereas  all  polyols  and  carbohydrates  increased  the  900  nm  absorbance  for

t>100  ns,  addition  of  up  to  50  vol  %  of  monohydroxyl  alcohols  (methanol,  ethanol,

propanol,  and  2-propanol)  had  no  effect  on  the  kinetics.  This  negative  result  is  in

agreement  with  the  previous  studies  of  Rabani  et  al.  [12].  With  the  exception  of  D-
arabitol (C5), for linear polyols the constant Kh is proportional to (n-1)2, where n is the

carbon  number,  i.e.,  the  scavenging  efficiency  rapidly  increases  with  the  number  of

hydroxyl groups per molecule. Having two hydroxyl groups in the 1,2-position (as in 1,2-

ethanediol vs. 1,3-propanediol) increases Kh. Closing a polyol into a ring considerably

decreases  Kh  (compare  D-mannitol  and  inositol).  This  decrease  is  accounted  for  by

postulating that in sugars, neighboring hydroxyl groups oriented to the same side of the

ring have higher scavenging efficiency than same groups oriented to the opposing sides

(Scheme 1).  The  example  of D-glucal and D-galactal (Table 1 and Scheme 1) suggest

that the difference in the scavenging efficiency for these two orientations is ca. 2.5 times.

As  more  neighboring  hydroxyl  groups  are  added,  this  difference  becomes  smaller

(compare D-glucose and D-galactose, Table 1). The highest constants Kh were found for

a disaccharide, D-lactose, and a furanose, D-fructose (Table 1).

Given that hole scavenging is very rapid and structure-specific it is likely that the

reaction involves a scavenger molecule that is chemisorbed at the particle surface in a

particular  way.  Recent  XANES  studies  by  Rajh  and  co-workers  show  that  for  small

aqueous  TiO2  nanoparticles,  surface  titanium  atoms  change  the  coordination  from

octahedral  to  square  pyramidal  (with  a  coordination  number  of  five)  [2,18,27].  These

undercoordinated  sites  exhibit  enhanced  reactivity  towards  bidentate  ligands,  such  as

ascorbic  acid,  dopamine,  and  catechol,  that  bind  to  these  sites  and  change  the

coordination of Ti atoms back to octahedral, "repairing" the site [2]. The spectroscopic

manifestation of this bidentate binding is a red shift in the absorption spectrum of the
coated nanoparticles due to a partial charge transfer from the nanoparticle to the π system

of the ligand [2,27]. Since the active site of these ligands, -CH(OH)=CH(OH)-, closely

resembles  that  of  the  polyols  (-CH2(OH)-CH2(OH)-), an experiment was conducted to

discern  whether  the  polyols  and  carbohydrates  also  bind  to  undercoordinated  titania

atoms at the nanoparticle surface.

10

3.3. XANES spectroscopy of surface modified nanoparticles.

The  typical  Ti  K-edge  XANES  spectra  are  shown  in  Fig.  3.  To  obtain  these

spectra, polylols were added in a concentration sufficient to obtain the total coverage of

Ti atoms at the particle surface, and the solutions were dried. The XANES signal from

undercoordinated Ti sites is seen in Fig. 3 as a sharp feature centered at 4.97 keV [2,18].

This  feature  is  present  in  the  TiO2 nanoparticles but absent in crystalline anatase. The

polyol-  and  carbohydrate-coated  nanoparticles  exhibit  a  4.97  keV  signal  that  is

intermediate  to  these  two  extremes,  suggesting  that  undercoordinated  Ti  atoms  are

partially  "repaired"  by  these  hole  scavengers.  The  efficiency  of  this  repair  appears  to

decrease  with  the  number  of  hydroxyl  groups  in  the  modifier  molecule.  At  the  full

surface  coverage,  ethylene  glycol  (C2)  and  glycerol  (C3)  repair  85%  of  the

undercoordinated surface sites, erythritol (C4) and fructose (C6) repair 54% of these sites,

and  D-arabitol (C5),  D-glucose (C6)  and  D-glucal (C6)  repair  43%  of  these  sites.  This

observation  suggests  that  extra  hydroxyl  groups,  while  increasing  the  binding  to  the

surface, may not assist in the repair of undercoordinated Ti atoms as efficiently as they do

in  smaller  polyols.  In  any  case,  these  XANES  spectra  indicate  that  polyols  and

carbohydrates  are  efficient  surface  modifiers  and  that  a  significant  fraction  of

undercoordinated  sites  are  capped  in  a  manner  similar  to  the  related  chelating  ligands

[2,18,27].

4. Discussion.

Given the scarcity of structural data on the interaction between polyols and the

surface  of  TiO2  nanoparticles  in  aqueous  solution,  we  may  only  speculate  on  the

mechanism for hole scavenging by these hydroxylic compounds.

Very  generally,  the  scavenging  constant  K h  combines  two  quantities,  not

necesserily related: (i) the efficiency of binding to a specific site(s) at the nanoparticle

surface  and  (ii)  the  efficiency  of  hole  scavenging  at  this  binding  site(s).  For  a  46  Å
diameter  nanoparticle,  the  surface  area  is  ca.  6700  Å2  and,  assuming  that  a  typical
carbohydrate  molecule  occupies  5-10  Å2,  total  coverage  of  the  surface  of  0.24  mM

nanoparticles is achieved at 0.1-0.3 M of the modifier. This estimate, however, assumes

that  all  of  the  molecules  are  adsorbed  by  the  nanoparticles,  which  is  unlikely  in  an

11

aqueous solution. In particular, large critical concentrations (=Kh

-1) for ethylene glycol

and 1,3-propanediol, suggest a partition between free and bound molecules. We believe

that rapid increase in the scavenging efficiency with the number of anchoring hydroxylic

groups mainly reflects shifting of the equilibrium towards physi- and chemi- sorption of

the polyols by the nanoparticle surface, in an aqueous solution.

Once at the surface, a hydroxylic molecule can be chemisorbed. IR spectroscopy

provides ample evidence for chemisorption of monohydroxyl alcohols at titania surfaces
and  the  formation  of  TiIV-O-R  groups  in  vacuo  (e.g.,  [13,14]).  Polyols  can  be

chemisorbed in a similar manner, and the XANES spectroscopy provides direct evidence

that  the  complexation  does  occur,  at  least  for  undercoordinated  titanium  sites.  The

resulting structure may look like that shown in Fig. 4. This optimized-geometry structure

was generated using a molecular mechanics modeling program HyperChem 7.5 (obtained

from  HyperCube,  Inc.)  that  uses  MM+  force  field.  In  the  octahedral  (-O)2Ti(OH)4
complex shown in Fig. 4, the dihedral O-C-C-O angle in the ligand is close to 60o and the
O-Ti-O angle is close to 87o, which results in a distance of 2.73 Å between the bridging

oxygens.  This  distance  may  be  compared  to  2.825-2.826  Å  and  2.8  Å  between  the

oxygens of neighboring hydroxyl groups in inositol (for trans- and cis- orientations of

these groups, respectively), calculated using the same program. This comparison suggests

that  polyols  and  carbohydrates  can  be  readily  accommodated  into  the  octahedral

complex.  Interestingly,  the  same  calculations  suggest  that  trans-  orientation  of  the

hydroxyl groups in sugars may be favored energetically because the chair conformation

of  the  pyranose  is  preserved  in  the  complex,  whereas  binding  to cis- hydroxyl groups

requires a conformational change to a twisted boat.

The above considerations help to visualize the mode of carbohydrate binding to

certain sites at the titania surface. We suggest that Kh is mainly determined by the density

of such sites in an aqueous solution rather than the efficiency of hole scavenging at these

binding sites. Indeed, in the absence of water, rutile surfaces exposed to methanol vapor

trap  the  holes  as  rapidly  and  efficiently  [13,14]  as  the  polyol-coated  aqueous

nanoparticles.  In  vacuo,  monohydroxyl  alcohols  (ROH)  are  chemisorbed  at  the  TiO2
surface  as  TiIV-O-R  groups  [13,14].  In  acidic  aqueous  solution,  the  chemisorption  is

thermodynamically unfavorable and these alkoxy groups are promptly hydrolyzed. To

12

shift this equilibrium towards a bound structure which is stable in the room-temperature

aqueous  environment,  chelation  must  occur,  and  the  magnitude  of  Kh  may  reflect  the

efficiency of this specific mode of the complexation.

We turn now to the salient point of the suggested rationale, that is, why chemi-

rather  than  physi-  sorbed  polyol  and  carbohydrate  molecules  serve  as  efficient  hole

scavengers (the same conclusion was reached by Yamakata et al. in their study of hole

scavenging by monohydroxyl alcohols at the exposed rutile surface [13,14]).

If the molecule is physisorbed, the scavenging reaction involves a trapped hole

(an  oxygen  hole  center)  and  a  nearby  scavenger  molecule:  the  trapping  of  the  hole
precedes the scavenging reaction. These trapped holes are, essentially, TiIV-O• radicals

[8] and the abstraction of hydrogen by these radicals is probably too slow to compete

with  the  electron-hole  recombination  that  occurs  on  nano-  or  subnano-  second  time

scales. By contrast, when the polyols cap the surface sites, free holes generated in the

primary photoexcitation process can be trapped at these sites directly, by the bridging

oxygens of the complex (Scheme 2). The resulting species rapidly transfers a proton to
water  and/or  adsorbed  molecules,  yielding  a  relatively  stable,  bound  Ti(IV)-O-•CH-

radical. Such surface-linked radicals have been observed in low-temperature EPR studies

of photoilluminated TiO2 nanoparticles in frozen aqueous solutions containing alcohols

[8]. The fact that these C-centered radicals are bridged to the titanium helps to account

for  their  relative  stability  towards  oxidation.  As  mentioned  above,  some  C-centered

radicals derived from the alcohols, such as CH2OH, decay by injecting the electron into

the TiO2 nanoparticle [26]. In the acidic solution, this “injection” is a concerted electron

and hydroxyl proton transfer [28]. Since the latter is impossible for a bridged structure,

the “injection” is inhibited as it requires the scission of the Ti-O bond.

The verifiable signature of the proposed mechanism is that the hole scavenging

occurs on a much shorter time scale than a nanosecond; in fact, it should occur on the

picosecond or shorter time scales. Given that 50-60% of the holes can be trapped by the

surface Ti complexes, hole scavenging should actively intervene with hole trapping that

occurs on these short time scales.

Such an intervention is also needed to account for the constancy of the prompt

near-IR absorbance from the trapped electrons in the presence of the hole scavengers.

13

Since the characteristic life time of the recombination of trapped charges that is observed

on the sub-microsecond time scale is 8-10 ns, any fast or ultrafast process that involves

rapid conversion of the trapped hole to a radical (incapable of recombination with the
electron) would de  facto increase the prompt yield of the electron at t=0+, by arresting

this  recombination  within  the  duration  of  the  355  nm  excitation  pulse.  One  way  to

interpret the observed persistance of the prompt 900 nm absorbance (and the applicability

of eq. (1) in general) is to assume that in the low-density regime explored in our study,

most of the geminate electron-hole pairs that recombine on sub-nanosecond time scale

involve  free charge  carriers.  Electron  and  hole  trapping  by  surface  defects  (including

polyol complexes) slows the charge recombination down, and the nanosecond absorption

signal integrates over the slowly recombining pairs of the trapped charges (Scheme 2).

The characteristic time for the charge trapping and free carrier recombination is just 100-

300 fs [29,30] and 10-20 ps [5,6,7], respectively. Polyol complexes compete for the hole

both with other surface defects and the electrons. Perhaps, hole scavenging by the polyols
is  as  rapid  as  that  by  adsorbed  SCN-  anions  at  the  surface  of  aqueous  suspension  of

Degussa P-25 powders in the picosecond studies of Colombo and Bowman [6], who used

time-resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to observe the evolution of the electron

absorbance  in  the  vis  (Fig.  3  in  ref.  [6]).  These  authors  found  that  most  of  the  hole

scavenging occurred within the duration of 310 nm photoexcitation pulse, which was <

100 fs. If the deprotonation of the hole trapped by the polyol complex is slower than its

recombination with the short-lived free electron, the overall recombination process is not

perturbed and the prompt trapped electron yield does not change.

5. Conclusion.

It is shown that carbohydrates and C2-C6 polyols rapidly (< 6 ns) scavenge >

50% of the holes in aqueous anatase nanoparticles. The scavenging efficiency increases

with  the  number  of  anchoring  hydroxyl  groups  and  is  sensitive  to  small  structural

changes  in  the  carbohydrate.  This  variation  is  attributed  to  the  efficiency  of

chemisorption  of  the  scavenger  by  the  titania  surface  in  the  aqueous  environment.  A

specific  binding  site  for  polyhydroxylated  aliphatic  compounds  at  the  nanoparticle

surface is suggested that involves an octahedrally coordinated Ti atom that is chelated by

14

neighboring hydroxyl groups of the ligand. This binding accounts for the depletion of

pentacoordinated  Ti  atoms  that  was  observed  in  the  XANES  spectra  of  coated  TiO2

nanoparticles. We suggest that these binding sites serve as a trap for short-lived free holes

and scavenge a substantial fraction of these holes before the latter descend to other traps

and/or recombine with the (free) electrons. The resulting trapped hole rapidly loses a CH
proton to the environment, yielding a metastable, TiIV-O- bound C-centered radical.

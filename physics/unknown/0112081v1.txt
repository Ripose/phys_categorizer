Abstract

          It  was  shown  that  there  is  a  practical  possibility  of  gravity  control  on
electroluminescent  (EL)  materials  (physics/0109060).  We  present  here  a    type
Gravitational  Shielding  based  on  an    EL  phosphor  namely  zinc  sulfide  doped  with
silver  (ZnS:Ag  )  which  can  reduce  the  cost  of  the  Gravitational  Motor  previously
presented.

Introduction

the  reported  effect  and  presented  a

field  causes  the  phosphor  to  rapidly
charge  and  discharge,  resulting  in  the
emission  of  light  during  each  cycle.
The  number  of 
light  pulses  are
determined  by 
the  magnitude  of
applied voltage, so, the brightness and
color  of  the  light  emitted  from  the  EL
material will vary subject to the change
of the operating voltage and frequency.
For  example,  increasing  the  voltage
increases 
whereas
brightness, 
increasing  the  frequency  of  applied
voltage  will  increase  brightness  and
the frequency  f  of the emitted light.

1. Gravitational Shielding

           Let us consider a thin phosphor
composition
chemical 
layer  with 
ZnS:Ag,  index  of  refraction  2.36,  and
thickness    x     on  a  metallic  spherical
shell with outer radius R.
           When  a  specific  alternating
voltage  VAC    with  frequency  fAC    is
applied  to  the  metallic  spherical  shell,
the  electric  field  causes  the  phosphor
to 
rapidly  charge  and  discharge,
resulting  in  the  emission  of  blue  light
).  Inside  the  phosphor
(
this fluorescent radiation   will  fall  upon
the  atoms.  It  can  be  shown  that  the
probability of this radiation to reach the
nucleons (protons and neutrons) of the
atoms  is  practically  null,  thus  we  can
assume  that  the  radiation  fall  only
upon 
the  electrons,  consequently
changing,  their  gravitational  masses.
Under 
the
gravitational  masses  of  the  electrons,
according to Eq. (2), will be given by:

2. Gravitational  Motor

shielding 

          From the technical point of view,
the  cost  of  the    Gravitational  Motor
presented  in  recent  papers2,3  can  be
strongly  reduced  by  means  of  the
gravitational 
above
mentioned.
          Let  us  consider  the  schematic
diagram  for  the  Gravitational  Motor  in
Fig.2.  Basically,  it  is  similar  to  the
previous  design2.  But  the  quantity  of
EL  material  in  this  model  is  very    less
than in the previous one. Consequently
it will have a very smaller cost.
          Now  the idea  isn't  to invert  the
weight    of  the  cylinders  of  EL  material
on the left side of the rotor but to annul
the weight of spheres of lead by means
of the gravitational shielding which coat
them (see Fig.2).

Gravitational  Spacecraft,    works  by

The  negative  masse  can  be  supplied
by  means  of  a  system-G  4  (  Appendix
A ) or by means of  an EL material  as
the  phosphor  (ZnS:Ag  ),  in  agreement
with  we  have  seen  in  the  §1  of  this
paper.
          In  that  case,  to  understand  how
it  works,  let  us  imagine  an  aircraft,
which is totally  coated with a  layer of
ZnS:Ag.  When  a  appropriated  voltage
VAC    with  frequency  fAC    is  applied  on
the metallic surface of  the aircraft, the
phosphor  emits  a  fluorescent  radiation
(blue  light  ; 
  )  and
consequently, as we have seen, inside
the  phosphor  this  fluorescent  radiation

the

          Consequently  we  can  decrease
the  gravitational  mass  of  the  aircraft
increasing  the  value  of  K.  In  practice
will  be  possible  to reduce  the  value  of
gaM  up to some milligrams.
           On  the  other  hand,  considering
the  new  expression  for  the  inertial

of    its  gravitational  mass.  This  is
fundamentally  a  new  concept  of
aerospace flight .

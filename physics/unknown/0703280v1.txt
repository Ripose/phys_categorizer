Abstract. Transformation equations for the kinetic energy of the same 
bullet in Galileo’s and Einstein’s special relativity are derived. The special 
relativity result is extended to the case of a photon. 
 
 
The Physics Teacher presents an interesting example of how Galilean 
relativity is involved in the presentation of a dynamics problem.1 We present 
a  simpler  version  of  it  using  usual  relativistic  notations.  Restating  the 
problem  consider  two  inertial  reference  frames  I  and  I’,  I’  moving  with 
speed  V  relative  to  I  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  overlapped  OX(O’X’) 
axes.  The problem is to find out a relationship between the kinetic energies 
of the same ball moving along the same direction, as measured by observers 
from  I  and  I’  respectively.  Making  the  convention  to  present  physical 
quantities measured in I as unprimed and physical quantities measured in I’ 
as primed, the work-kinetic energy theorem reads in I 
 
 
reading in I’ 
 
 
in accordance with the fact that the laws of mechanics are the same in all 
inertial reference frames in relative motion. In (1) and (2) W(W’), F(F’), 
u(u’) and t(t’) stand for the kinetic energy, force, speed and time 
respectively. Combining (1) and (2) we obtain

In  the  limits  of  Newtonian  mechanics,  force,  mass  and  time 

 
intervals have the same magnitude, the velocities adding as 
 
 
the  accelerations  of  the  same  particle  having  the  same  magnitude  in  both 
inertial reference frames, i.e.

Taking all that into account (3) becomes successively 

 

 

 

Relativists would criticize (6) telling that in its right side we add a physical 
quantity measured in I’(W’) with a physical quantity measured in  I (mVdu) 
and so they present it as

Applied in the case of the scenario proposed followed in1 (6) leads to 
 
 
uf and ui standing for the final and the initial speeds of the ball in I 
recovering the results obtained in1. 
 
the same problem could be of interest. In order to so solve the problem we 
start with (1) and (2) taking into account that the OX(O’X’) component of 
the force has the same magnitude  in all inertial reference frames2 and that u 
and u’ add as2 
 
 

The authors of the paper we revise suggest that a relativistic version of

with u’>0 in order to avoid indeterminacy. For u=u’=c the ball we 
considered so far is a photon the kinetic energy of which transforms as 

We consider that our presentation is straightforward and time saving 

 
being consequently based on the concepts of classical  and special relativity.

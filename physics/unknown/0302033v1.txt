Introduction 

The “when, where and how” earthquake prediction is not a solved problem [1].  
The more precision space and time set  for Earth’s crust  condition parameters and the 
including in the monitoring the electromagnetic fields measurements under, on and over Earth 
surface, the temperature distribution and other possible precursors can be useful for research 
of the “When, where and how” earthquake’s prediction [2]. The progress in this direction is 
summarized in [3].   

In Part 1 are given the 2002 statistics estimations for the reliability of the time window 
earthquake  prediction  on  the  basis  of  geomagnetic  field  measurements  and  Earth  tidal 
behavior [3] for Balkan, Black Sea region. 

In  Part  2  the  preliminary  analysis  of  the  approach  is  applied  for  England,  Turkey  an 

India region. 

In  Part  3  the  list  of  monitoring  parameters,  which  can  be  useful,  the  theoretical 

apparatus for analysis and technology for data acquisition are described shortly 
 
Part  1.The  geomagnetic  field  likes  a  time  window  precursor  for  Balkan,  Black  Sea 
region-2002 

The one  geomagnetic vector projection  GMF  is measured with accuracy less then  or 
equal  to1  nT  (detector:  know-how  of  JINR,  Dubna,  Boris  Vasiliev)  with  2.4  samples  per 
second, Nm is equal to 144 samples per minute.  

The minute averaged value GMFm and its error D GMFm are given by  

GMFm =  S

 i=1,Nm  GMFi/ Nm  and  D GMFm =  S

 i=1,Nm  D GMFi/ Nm.

After some time (from 1999 to 2001) of looking for correlations between the behavior 
of the geomagnetic field, Earth tidal gravitational potential and the occurred earthquakes one

The  Figure  2  illustrates  the  behavior of geomagnetic field and its variation for a day with a 
signal  for  near  future  earthquake.  One  has to be sure there are not a  cosmos  reasons for  the 
geomagnetic quake. So, for example, see the sites [8]. 
 
The time window of the incoming events is defined by the next date of the Earth tidal 
potential extremum with tolerance +/-1 day in the case of minimum and +/-2 days in the case 
of maximum. For the example in Figure 2 the predicted time was at June 4 +/- 1 day.  
 
The answer of the question for distinguishing the predicted event (or group of events – 
aftershocks) from the events which can occur in the region in the same time window is given 
by the parameter SChtM: 

SChtM = Mag / ((REQ + Distance) / 1000) 2, 
 where [Distance] = km, REQ [km] is the radios of earthquake volume. Roughly, at this stage 
of our knowledge, we accept REQ = 30 km. 
The parameter SChtM  is a measure of the energy influence of the earthquakes at the  device 
point.  
  
For  the  concrete  example  in  Figure  2  the  predicted  earthquake  had  occur  with 
parameters: Time 6/4/2002 21:10, Lat.: 40.45, Long.: 21.75, Dep.: 27, Mag.: 3.1, Dist.: 271 and 
SChtM: 42.   

At this stage of research all earthquakes have the same SChtM parameter for different 
definitions of the Magnitude. After developing on the basis of inverse nonlinear problem the 
empirical  and  theoretical  dependences  between  incoming  earthquake  processes,  magnetic 

s
 

 

quake  and  parameters  of  earthquake  we  will  arrive  to  a  set  of  SChtM  parameter  in 
correspondence with  the different  definition  of  Magnitude.  The  volume,  its  depth,  chemical 
and geological structures have to be included in the dependences. 
 

3 

It is interesting to stress that in the case of big earthquake with Mag > 6, in more than 
60  %  of  the  cases,  after  the  earthquake there are very  little variations of the magnetic field 
with different time duration: from 10 minute to some hours.  Those influences do not  depend 
on the distances, but one can see  the  differences,  which  depend  on the zone of earthquake: 
convergence or divergence one. See for example next Figure 3.  

 

In the next Table 1 are represented 2002 data for dates of magnetic quake and of predicted 
time window for 37 near future earthquakes.

In the time period because of hardware problems a signals for the geomagnetic quake was not 
published four times.  

The  independent  control  (In  the  framework  of  Strasbourg  recommendations  about 
earthquake prediction of the European Union for ethical and public security reasons) of the 
prediction reliability was organized in the framework of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 
its Geophysical Institute and a set of colleagues, which are interested in the topic or research. 

So, the  time of  37  events  was  predicted  successfully,  four  was  let  pass,  because  of 
hardware  problems.  The  notion  “event”  means  one  or  more  earthquakes  with  the  same 
epicenter and in some times 2 or 3 earthquakes, which occurred in the same time window, but 
in different epicenters. The main reasons for this ambiguity are: 

1.  The measuring of only one (instead of geomagnetic vector) geomagnetic projection in 

one point (at last 2, better 3); 

2.  The absence of data under analysis for electro-potential distribution in Crust.  

In the next Figure 4 are presented the distribution of the time deviation (the difference 
between predicted time and the time of occurred earthquake) for all predicted earthquakes and 
its Gauss fit.  

The good Gauss fit of the distribution, the growth of the Gauss fit amplitude and 
constant  behavior  of  Gauss  fit  parameter  w  have  to  be  considered  like  prove  of 
reliability  of  the  time  window  prediction  basis  on  the  data  for  geomagnetic  quake  and 
Earth  tidal  behavior.    The  error  with  one  day  will  be  improved  after  including  in  the 
analyzed data the hourly tidal behavior.

In the  Figure 5 are presented for a comparison the distributions of the magnitude for 
all earthquakes in the region and for predicted one. It is seen the character of distributions is 
the  same,  which  is  implementer  argument  that  the  approach  is  based  on  the  real  physical 
dependences. 

 
The next Figure 6 is the 2002 NEIC earthquakes map for the region.

The next Figure  8 illustrates the distances to which the time window for future event can be 
predicted  in  the  framework  of  the  approach.  One  must  stress  that the aria is not symmetric 
one, which is connected with the geological history of the region.

In conclusion one can say that the earthquake time prediction approach on the basis of 
accurate measuring of the one geomagnetic vector projection can be accepted to work well at 
distance  to  250  km,  not  uniquely  to  450- 500 km, for  SChtM >  20 and  magnitude  interval 
2.6<Mag<5.3.  From  occurred  41  events,  37  were  predicted  and  4  was  let  pas.  From  446 
occurred earthquakes, the epicenters of 122 earthquakes were in the predictable region.

The  correspondence  is  not  unique  for  all  earthquakes.  There  are  some  peaks  of  the 
geomagnetic signal without earthquakes in the next 14 day period. But for earthquakes with 
SChtM >20 the correspondence is like for the Balkan, Black Sea region.

From Figure 11 one can see the SChtM dependence from the distance for occurred in 

2002 earthquakes in the Hartland region.

The  samples  of  the  measurement,  the  record  time,  the  different  dependences  of  the 
signal from standard deviations of the geomagnetic vector components and influence of ocean 
tidal influence has to be carefully analyzed.

risk. They are well known [10 ]. 

The aim of this Proposal is to create a system for research the reliability of the local 
forecast  system  for  earthquakes  in  the  interval  Mag  >  2.6-  3  and  radius  till  600  km.  The 
system is complex and  the  attended  practical  result will  be  an adequate  physical theoretical 
model  for  the  Earth  magnetism.  The  system  includes  experimental,  theoretical  and 
technological parts:  
Experimental data  

1.  Geomagnetic field, 
2.  Electro-potential distribution in the Earth crust and atmosphere, 
3.  Temperature Earth crust distribution, 
4.  Crust parameters (strain, deformation, displacement) 
5.  Gravitational anomaly map, 
6.  Season and day independent depth temperature distribution, 
7.  Water sources parameters (debit, temperature, chemical composition, radioactivity), 
8.  Gas emissions, 
9.  Ionosphere condition parameters, 
10. Infrared radiation of Earth surface, earthquake clouds 
11. Earth radiation belt, 
12. Sun wind,  
13. Biological precursors.  

1.  The  achievements  of  tidal  potential  modeling  of  Earth  surface  with  included  ocean 

and atmosphere tidal influences, 
2.  Many component correlation analysis  
3.  Nonlinear  inverse  problem  methods  in  fluids  dynamics  and  Maxwell  equations  are 

Theory 

crucial. 
Technologies  

GIS  for  archiving,  analysis,  visualization  and  interpretation  of  the  data  and  non- 
linear inverse problem methods for building theoretical models for the parameter behaviors, 
correlations and dynamics. 

 
The set of the devices has to be in correspondence with known data for  earthquakes 
risk  zone  (gravitational  anomalyties  and  Crust  parameters  monitoring  (strain,  deformation, 
displacement). The geomagnetic device set distance has  to be in order of 300  – 600 km, the 
electro- potential 100- 300 km in dependence of geological today situation and its history. The 
set for monitoring of the daily and season crust temperatures has to be in order  300 km. The 
correlations with Sun wind influence have to be in real time.  

The system has to be created step by step. The condition for next step pass has to be 
the building of physical clear new theoretical correlations or dynamical models and, of course, 
the successful: “when”, “when, where” or “when, where and how” earthquake prediction.  

14 days window “when” prediction  
For short time “when” prediction the set of geomagnetic monitoring with the accuracy, 
accepted  from  Intermagnet  [9],  but  with  50  samples  per  second  for  H,  D,  Z  or  X,  Y,  Z 
component  measurements  and  1  sample  per  second  for  F.  The  minute  averaged  standard 
deviation has to be calculated in real time. The electro- potential distribution dynamics under, 

 

14 

on  and  over  Earth  surface  will  correlates  with  geomagnetic  data.  The  estimation  of  the 
epicenter  coordinates  from  3  points  geomagnetic  devices  on  the  basis  of  inverse  problem  is 
possible. The time is fixed from the next minimum (+/-1 day time tolerance) or maximum (+/-
2 days) of daily averaged tidal potential. The influence of the ocean and atmosphere tides has 
to be under consideration. 

14 days window “when, where” prediction 
The epicenter coordinates  of near future event has to be estimated by the analysis of 
geomagnetic end electro-potential data. The information for the daily and season independent 
temperature  distribution, infrared activity,  ionosphere parameters, gravitational anomaly  set, 
the crust parameters dynamics and the hazard risk estimation for the region, has to improve 
the  coordinate’s  estimation.  In  the  case  of  big  events  the  appearing  of  “earthquakes  clouds” 
(Zhonghao  Shou)  and  quasi  magnetic  pole  in  the  region,  which  can  be  fixed  from  the 
radiation belts changes, will be important.  

14 days window “when, where, how” prediction 
The  gradient  distributions  of  the  above  mentioned  parameters, the burned new, more 
adequate physical models for parameter correlations and dynamics will give a data for step by 
step statistical estimation of the reliability of prediction. 

 
Conclusion 
The  solution  of  “when,  where,  how”  earthquake  prediction  problem  obviously 
needs the creation of very big science group. The presence in the group of  the  ”skeptics”  is 
very important.

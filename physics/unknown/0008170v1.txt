Abstract

The  75-keV  injector  and  6.7-MeV  RFQ  that  comprise
the  first  portion  of  the  cw,  100-mA  proton  linac  for  the
accelerator production of tritium (APT) project have been
built and operated.  The LEDA RFQ has been extensively
tested for pulsed and cw output-beam currents ≤100 mA.
Up  to  2.2  MW  of  cw  rf  power  from  the  350-MHz  rf
system is coupled into the RFQ, including 670 kW for the
cw proton beam.  The emittance for a 93-mA pulsed RFQ
output beam, as determined from quadrupole-magnet-scan
y = 0.25 × 0.31 (π mm mrad)2 [rms
measurements, is ε
normalized].  A  follow-on  experiment,  to  intentionally
introduce  and  measure  beam  halo  on  the  RFQ  output
beam, is now being installed.

1  INTRODUCTION

The LEDA RFQ [1] is a 100% duty factor (cw) linac
that delivers >100 mA of H+ beam at 6.7 MeV [2-4].  The
8-m-long, 350-MHz RFQ structure [5] accelerates the dc,
75-keV,  110-mA  H+  beam  from  the  LEDA  injector  [6]
with  ~94%  transmission.  The  primary  objectives  of
LEDA  are  to  verify  the  design  codes,  gain  fabrication
knowledge,  understand  beam  operation,  measure  output
beam characteristics, learn how to minimize the beam-trip
frequency,  and 
improve  prediction  of  costs  and
operational  availability  for  the  full  1000-  to  1700-MeV
APT  accelerator.  This  paper  summarizes 
the  RFQ
commissioning results given in [1, 3, 4, and 7-13].

are  the  injector  [6],  ion  source  and  low-energy  beam
transport (LEBT); RFQ [1, 4, 5]; high-energy beam trans-
port  (HEBT)  [14];  and  the  beamstop  [15].    The  injector
(Fig. 2) matches the 75-keV, 110-mA dc proton beam into
the  RFQ.  Simulations  of  offline  injector  measurements
[16]  indicate  the  RFQ  input  beam  rms  normalized
emittance is ≤0.23 π mm mrad [6].  A current modulator
feeding the microwave magnetron provides beam pulsing
[17]  for  commissioning  and  beam-tuning  activities.    The
on-line LEBT diagnostics include a pulsed-current toroid,
located directly before the RFQ (AC toroid 3), that is used
in determining the RFQ transmission.

A complete description  of  the  LEDA  RFQ,  including
the RFQ rf-field tuning procedure, resonance control, and
operation with the high-power rf (HPRF) and low-level rf
(LLRF)  systems,  is  given  in  [1,  4,  5,  9,  and  11]  and  the
references contained therein.    A  schematic  of  the  LEDA
HEBT  showing  the  location  of  beamline  optics  and
diagnostics is given in Fig. 3.  The function of the LEDA
HEBT  is  to  characterize  the  properties  of  the  6.7-MeV,
100-mA  RFQ  output  beam  and  transport  the  beam  with
low losses to a water-shielded ogive beamstop [15].  The
beamline  optics  consist  of  four  quadrupole-singlet  and
two X-Y steering magnets.

 3  BEAM COMMISSIONING RESULTS

AND DISCUSSION

We  have  accumulated  21  hr  of  LEDA  RFQ  operation
with ≥99 mA of cw output beam current and >110 hr with
≥90 mA of cw output beam current [11] since modifying
the  injector  and  increasing  the  RFQ  rf  fields  to  5-10%
above the design values as described in [1], [4], and [11].
For  one  run  of  118  min  (Fig.  4),  most  of  the  beam
interruptions  were  1-6  s  in  duration  (Fig.  5).    Recovery
from these interruptions, most of them arising from short-
duration  injector  and/or  rf-system  sparks,  was  automatic
(no operator intervention).

We find that during pulsed beam operation for RFQ rf-
field levels at the design value, for pulse lengths >200 µs,

and  for  RFQ  output  beam  currents  >90  mA,  the  RFQ
transmission  drops  abruptly  about  100  µs  into  the  beam
pulse [11].  The transmission then remains constant at the
lower  value  for  the  duration  of  the  pulse,  including  long
pulses.  The RFQ output beam current for a 300-µs-long
beam pulse is shown in Fig. 6. The current abruptly drops
by ~10% about 125 µs into the pulse. Figure 7 shows the
measured  values  for  the  total  beam  transmission  at  the
start and end of a 500-µs, 2-Hz, 90-mA beam pulse.  At
the  end  of  the  pulse  the  total  transmission  deviates  from
the  PARMTEQM  prediction  for  108-mA  output  beam
current  over  the  field-level  range  88-98%  of  the  design
(Fig.7).  The  total  transmission  at  the  start  of  the  pulse
follows  the  PARMTEQM  prediction  for  the  range  0.91-
1.1 of the design rf-field level.  For output beam currents
>90  mA,  e.g.  100  mA,  the  RFQ  transmission  over  the
whole pulse is increased to the design value by increasing
the  rf-field  level  to  105-110%  of  the  design  field.    Both
the  rf-power  system  and  the  RFQ-cooling  system  allow
this increase − the only drawback is that the RFQ requires
10-20% more input power.

 The LEDA RFQ output beam emittance is determined
[12,13] from quadrupole-magnet scan measurements [12].
For a 93-mA pulsed beam, three x quad scans are given in
Fig. 8 and three y quad scans in Fig. 9: also shown are the
quad-scan  simulations  obtained  using  the  particle-optics

IMPACT, which, like LINAC, includes non-linear space-
charge  effects,  is  used  to  calculate  the  beam  profiles  for
each  of  the  quadrupole  magnet  settings  used  in  the  quad
scans [13].  LINAC has 2-D (r-z) space charge; IMPACT,
3-D.  The Twiss parameters given above are used in these
calculations.  In Fig. 10 samples for 3 points in the x quad
scan are given as a) - c) [Fig. 8] and for 3 points in the y
quad  scan  as  d)  -  f)  [Fig.  9].    A  computer  program  that
adjusts the Twiss parameters to obtain the best global fit
to the measured beam profiles is being considered.

4 SUMMARY

The LEDA RFQ has operated with ≥99-mA cw output
beam  for  21  hr  cumulative:  it  has  operated  >110  hr
cumulative  with  ≥90-mA  cw  output  beam.  The  RFQ
output  beam  emittance  for  a  93-mA  pulsed  beam,  deter-
mined  from  quadrupole-magnet-scan  measurements,  is

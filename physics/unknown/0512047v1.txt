Abstract 

At first, a review of our knowledge on the distribution of galaxies at large-scale, 

leading  to  a  foam-like  large-scale  structure  of  the  Universe,  is  presented  in  the 

Introduction. Then, it is shown how, according to the present theory for the formation 

of  superclusters,  wave  scalar  perturbations    of  the  same  frequency  traveling  in 

opposite directions give rise to standing waves, which cause a motion of the cosmic 

material  towards  the  nodes,  resulting  in  the  concentration  of  the  cosmic  material 

around  the  nodes.  Generalizing  this  effect  to  two  (three)  dimensions,  the  cosmic 

material is concentrated around the node lines (node surfaces). It is proposed that the 

three-dimensional  effect  is  responsible  for  the  foam-like  large-scale  structure  of  the 

Universe. 

 

 

 

1.  Introduction 

2 

The first systematic study on the distribution of galaxies at large-scale was done 

by  G.O.  Abell  in  his  doctoral  dissertation  at  Caltech,  and  it  was  published  in 

Astrophysical  Journal  (Supplement  Series)  in  1958,  under  the  title  “The  distribution 

of  Rich  Clusters  of  Galaxies”  (Abell,  1958).  He  found  that  galaxies  are  clumped  in 

clusters  in  general.  A  fact  which  was  extracted  from  the  data  was  that  the  surface 

distribution  of  the  centers  of  the  clusters  was  not  random,  both  when  the  clusters 

considered  belonged  to  all  distances  indiscriminately,  and  when  the  clusters 

considered belonged to various concrete distances. The angular scale of the clumping 

of  the  distribution  varies  roughly  inversely  proportional  with  distance,  so  that  the 

linear  scale  is  the  same  for  all  distances.  Thus  Abell´s  data  suggest  the  existence  of 

second  order  clusters,  that  is  clusters  consisted  of  clusters  of  galaxies,  or,  as  it 

prevailed to be said, superclusters of galaxies. In fact, a statistical test, done by Abell, 

revealed  that  there  was  not  incompatibility  between  the  distribution  observed  and  a 

distribution  in  which  all  clusters  belonged  to  superclusters.  Thus,  Abell´s  work 

revealed the distribution of galaxies at large-scale. This was done by using apparent 

magnitudes  as  distance  indicators.  But  apparent  magnitudes  are  less  accurate  than 

redshifts as distance indicators. 

The main work which aimed directly to the investigation of the galaxy distribution 

at large-scale through redshifts, was done at the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) of the 

University of Harvard during many years up to 1982, when its results were published 

in the form of a paper (Davis et al, 1982). The authors of this paper wanted to make a 

complete  sky  survey  at  moderate  depth  and  of  large  angular  size.  Thus  the  space 

studied  constituted  a  sufficient  space  sample  of  the  Universe.  The  CfA  survey 

 

3 

confirmed  that  galaxies  form  clusters  in  general,  and  it  depicted  the  existence  of 

superclusters of size 20 – 30 h-1Mpc in the form of filaments and lumps. The CfA sky 

survey  also  depicted  the  existence  of  voids,  that  is  great  regions  not  containing 

galaxies.  Various  maps  resulted  by  the  survey  are  also  presented  in  the  paper 

mentioned. These maps confirmed the general impression that the clumping leads too 

clusters  at  small  scale.  But,  at  large-scales,  they  are  characterized  by  formations 

(superclusters) linked to one another and surrounding huge voids of size frequently 20 

Mpc or more. This distribution of galaxies is evident in the maps at largest scale, and 

is of hierarchical nature. In particular, the great voids, of about 30 Mpc in diameter, 

are equally well seen as compared to the clusters and superclusters. Thus it is evident 

that strong clumping at scale of the order of 20 Mpc is the rule, and that voids of 20 – 

30 Mpc in diameter are very frequent. The limits of the voids are defined by links of 

filaments among the clusters, which possess an obviously composite topology. Thus, 

our  picture of  the  Universe  at  large-scale  has  suffered  an  important  evolution.  Long 

ago, the Abell clusters were considered as isolated rare islands of high density in an 

otherwise  uniform  background  of  field  galaxies.  Now,  it  is  evident  that  such  a  field 

component  does  not exist  and that  the  clusters have  such a  great  extension  that it is 

impossible  for  someone  to  define  where  one  ends  and  another  begins.  Almost  all 

galaxies  in  the  sample  are  concentrated  into  clusters  at  small  scales,  and  there  are 

extended zones with galaxy density less than he mean. In conclusion, the distribution 

of  galaxies  in  space  is  characterized  by  great  filamentary  superclusters  of  an  extend 

up to 60 Mpc, and corresponding great voids, in a way such that it resembles to foam, 

or  sponge,  of  a  huge  scale,  the  cells  of  which  are  the  voids,  which  contain  in  their 

walls concentrated all the galactic material, that is the superclusters. Maps produced 

by  n-body  simulations  are  also  presented  in  the  paper  mentioned.  These  maps  are 

 

4 

roughly fitted to the density and the amplitude of the galactic clumping, but they fail 

to present the foamy, or spongy, nature of the actual clumping. Thus, all these results 

present a severe challenge to all theories of galaxy and cluster formation. 

The galaxy redshift sky survey of CfA was extended. Some of the results of this 

extension are presented in Lapparent et al, 1986. The new sample presents, as a main 

characteristic  of  the  new  data,  the  fact  that  galaxies  seem  to  be  on  the  surfaces  of 

structures resembling in form to bubbles. These bubbles have a typical diameter (cid:1) 25 

h-1Mpc.  Another  relevant  paper  is  that  of  K.-H.  Schmidt  (1983).  Here  also  the 

distribution of galaxy clusters reveals many chains and filaments of galaxies 50 – 200 

h-1Mpc  in  size.  There  are  also  many  voids,  some  of  which  were  also  previously 

known. H.J. Rood´s review under the title “Clusters of Galaxies” (Rood, 1981) is also 

relevant  to  the  distribution  of  galaxies  at  large-scale  in  such  a  way  that  they  form 

clusters,  which  in  turn  join  themselves  into  superclusters  leaving  huge  voids  among 

them.  It  is  recorded  in  the  abstract  of  this  paper  that  redshift    surveys  for  great 

homogeneous  samples  of  galaxies  have  led  to  an  improved  picture  of  the  three-

dimensional  distribution  of  galaxies  in  space,  and  that  the  basic  new  recognized 

characteristics  of  large-scale  are  superclusters  with  typical  sizes  (cid:1)  100  Mpc  (330 

million light years) and also equally large voids free of galaxies. It is stated by Rood 

(1981)  that  the  three-dimensional  order  of  galaxies  seems  to  be  chains  and  lumps 

separated by huge voids. In fact, the huge voids are a general phenomenon, as the CfA 

sky  survey´s  sample  also  reveals.  I  also  mention  J.H.  Oort´s  review  under  the  title 

“Superclusters”  (Oort,  1983).  He  comments  various  general  properties  of 

superclusters  like  the  voids  formed  among  them,  and  he  also  mentions  the  existing 

supercluster formation theories. It must be observed that, according to these theories, 

we  can  obtain  the  foam-like  large-scale  structure  of  the  Universe,  by  performing 

 

5 

suitable  simulations.  For  example  see  Fig.17 in  Rood,  1981,  and  Fig.6 in  Einasto  et 

al, 1980, reproduced here as Fig.1 and Fig.2 respectively. I will propose in the next 

section  a  new  simple  and  natural  theory  for  mainly  the  formation  of  the  foam-like 

large-scale structure of the Universe based on the relativistic theory of perturbations 

(gravitational  instability)  in  the  Universe,  this  latter  initiated  by  Lifshitz  & 

Khalatnikov, 1963.

2.  The theory of standing waves in the Universe 

 

 

The theory of gravitational instability of an isotropic universe was first developed 

by Lifshitz & Khalatnikof, 1963. A simplified version of this theory can be found in 

Landau  &  Lifshitz,  1975,  in  Zel´dovich  &  Novikov,  1983,  and  in  Peebles,  1980. 

According  to  this  theory  the  cosmological  perturbations  can  be  expanded  in  plane 

waves.  Using  cartesian  coordinates  we  can  write  the  periodic  space  factor  for  these 

waves in the form

node (see Fig.3). Thus the material point will oscillate (but not harmonically!) about a 

node. Finally, because of friction, the material point will settle down at the node. In 

this way all of the oscillating (harmonically now!) material will be concentrated at the 

nodes.  Thus  a  simple  “structure”  is  formed  at  a  node,  for  example  a  cluster  of 

galaxies. 

Up to now we have limited ourselves to one dimension and obtained the formation 

of  point  concentrations  of  cosmic  material,  that  is  “point”  structures  (clusters).  A 

similar analysis can be performed in two dimensions, leading now to concentration of 

cosmic  material  on  the  node  lines  (see  Fig.20-7  of  Resnick  &  Halliday,  1966, 

reproduced here as Fig.4, and Figs.362 & 363 of Alexopoulos, 1960, reproduced here 

as Figs.5 & 6). Thus “line” structures can be formed, for example filaments. 

Finally  performing  the  above  analysis  in  full  three  dimensions,  we  will  obtain  a 

concentration  of  the  cosmic  material  on  the  node  surfaces  now.  In  this  way  we  can 

simply  and  naturally  explain  the  existence  of  huge  voids  in  the  Universe,  with  the 

cosmic material concentrated on the “walls” of the voids. This is write the foam-like 

structure of the Universe observed.

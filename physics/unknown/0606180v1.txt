Abstract  –  We  address  the  feasibility  of  a  GNSS-R  code-
altimetry  space  mission  and  more  specifically  a  dominant 
term of its error budget: the reflected-signal range precision. 
This  is  the  RMS  error  on  the  reflected-signal  delay,  as 
estimated  by  waveform  retracking.  So  far,  the  approach 
proposed by [Lowe et al., 2002] has been the state of the art to 
theoretically  evaluate  this  precision,  although  known  to  rely 
on strong assumptions (e.g., no speckle noise). In this paper, 
we  perform  a  critical  review  of  this  model  and  propose  an 
improvement  based  on  the  Cramer-Rao  Bound  (CRB) 
approach.  We  derive  closed-form  expressions  for  both  the 
direct  and  reflected  signals.  The  performance  predicted  by 
CRB  analysis  is  about  four  times  worse  for  typical  space 
mission scenarios. The impact of this result is discussed in the 
context  of  two  classes  of  GNSS-R  applications:  mesoscale 
oceanography and tsunami detection.  

I. INTRODUCTION 

GNSS-R,  the  use  of  Global  Navigation  Satellite  Systems 
(GNSS)  reflected  signals  is  a  powerful  and  potentially 
disruptive  technology  for  remote  sensing:  wide  coverage, 
passive, precise, long-term, all-weather and multi-purpose. 
GNSS  emit  precise  signals  which  will  be  available  for 
decades  as  part  of  an  emerging  infrastructure  resulting 
from  the  enormous  effort  invested  in  GPS,  GLONASS, 
Galileo  and  augmentation  systems.  A  key  advantage  of 
GNSS-R  is  its  “multistatic”  character:  unlike  monostatic 
systems,  a  single  receiver  will  collect  information  from  a 
simultaneous  set  of  reflection  points  associated  to  GNSS 
emitters. A system in low Earth orbit capable of collecting 
GPS,  Galileo  and  GLONASS  data  would  potentially  be 
combing  the  surface  with  more  than  a  dozen  reflection 
tracks at the same time (for a review, see [Ruffini 2006]). 

An important aspect is that GNSS signals are very weak as 
they  were  not  designed  for  radar  applications;  yet  they 
contain  a  wealth  of  information.  For  this  reason,  signal 
processing  plays  an  important  role.  The  first  detection  of 
GNSS signals from space was documented in [Lowe et al., 
2002].  More  recently,  GPS-R  L1  C/A  signals  have  been 
successfully detected from a dedicated experiment in space 
using  a  moderate  gain  antenna  [Gleason  et  al.,  2005], 
complementing  a  large  number  of  experiments  from 
aircraft and stratospheric balloons. The resulting data will 
be used to further validate models. 

The reflection process affects the signal in several ways, at 
the  same  time  degrading  (from  the  point  of  view  of 
detection)  and  loading  it  with  information  from  the 
reflecting  surface.  The  waveform  amplitude  is  normally 

reduced,  the  shape  distorted  and  signal  coherence  mostly 
lost. 

While GNSS-R  cannot provide  the precision  of dedicated 
radar  altimetry  missions,  it  offers  a  significant  advantage 
thanks to its multistatic character. The impact of GNSS-R 
altimetry  data  to  global  circulations  models  has  been 
studied  through  simulations,  with  very  promising  results 
[Le  Traon  et  al.,  2002].  Another  recent  impact  study  has 
focused  on  the  potential  of  GNSS-R  to  detect  Tsunami’s 
[Martín-Neira  et  al.,  2005].  A  dedicated  GNSS  altimetry 
system  could  provide  timely  warnings,  potentially  saving 
many  lives.  As  described  in  [Soulat  et  al.,  2005], 
simulations  have  indicated  that  a  global  100%  tsunami 
detection rate in less than two hours is possible with a ten 
satellite GNSS-R constellation. 

Altimetry  in  GNSS-R  can  be  carried  out  in  two  general 
ways,  depending  on  the  ranging  principle  used.  In  code 
altimetry, our focus here, the code is used for ranging with 
the  direct  and  reflected  signals.  In  phase  altimetry,  the 
phase of the signal is used. All of this is rather similar to 
normal  GNSS processing.  The  main  difference  is  that  the 
reflected signal is affected by the reflection process, which 
generally  distorts  the  triangular  waveform  shape  of  the 
return  and  renders  the  reflected  signal  very  incoherent. 
This makes the ranging task rather challenging. 

II. 

RANGE PRECISION AND ALTIMETRY 

Contrarily to classical radar altimetry, range precision is a 
dominant  factor  in  the  error  budget  for  a  GNSS-R  code-
altimetry space mission, due to the much lower modulation 
bandwidth  (1  MHz  or  10  MHz  for  the  GPS  C/A  and  P 
codes respectively). If the direct signal error is considered 
negligible  in  front  of  the  reflected  signal  error,  the 
altimetry  precision  σh  writes  simply  as  a  function  of  the 
reflected signal range precision σR: 

σ

h =

σ
R
sin2

, 

Eq. 1 

ε
where  ε  is  the  transmitter  elevation  angle.  [Lowe  et  al. 
2002]  proposed  a  simple  approach  to  assess  σR  and  since 
then, the majority of space mission feasibility studies (e.g. 
the  ESA  PARIS  and  STERNA  studies)  rely  on  this 
reference  as  an  approximation.  However,  this  model  is 
known  to  neglect  important  aspects—notably  speckle—
and a re-evaluation of the matter is necessary. 

Section III presents a critical review of the state of the art 
and discusses the model validity. Section IV introduces the 

Cramer-Rao  Bound  (CRB)  theory  which  constitutes  the 
foundation of our analysis approach. This methodology is 
then applied to both the direct and reflected GNSS signals 
to  derive  closed-form  expressions  of  range  precision  in 
sections V and VI respectively. Finally, the impact of new 
performance predictions is illustrated in section VII where 
mission scenarios are discussed in the light of two classes 
of applications. 

III. 

STATE OF THE ART REVIEW 

The  approach  proposed  in  [Lowe  et  al.  2002]  basically 
assumes that range precision for the reflected signal can be 
evaluated (to first order) in the same way as for the direct 
signal. The reflected waveform is assumed to be re-tracked 
using  the  algorithm  of  [Thomas,  1995].  This  algorithm 
estimates  the  direct  waveform’s  delay  using  three  points 
(the peak and its two immediate neighbours) to determine 
the  peak  sub-sample  position.  In  the  limit  of  low  thermal 
noise the precision of this algorithm turns out to be

Eq. 2 

where  τc  is  the  chip  length,  C(2)  is  the  correlation  factor 
between  amplitudes  separated  by  two  lags  and  snr  is  the 
signal to noise ratio, defined as the ratio between average 
and standard deviation of the peak amplitude. 

The  approach  proposed  by  [Lowe  et  al.]  suffers  from 
several limitations. First, it is valid for relatively high SNR 
only.  Second,  the  derived  expression  is  tied  to  the  choice 
of  a  particular  estimator.  It  cannot  then  be  considered 
applicable  to  others  and  as  such,  it  does  not  address  the 
general  case  of  retracking  where  an  arbitrary  number  of 
waveform’s  points  are  fit  by  a  model.  Third,  the  derived 
expression  (and  associated  estimator)  assumes  a  direct 
signal statistical model whereas the reflected signal is quite 
different.  The  waveform’s  fluctuations  are  caused  by 
thermal noise but also by speckle. Besides, the waveform’s 
shape is far from the triangular aspect of the direct signal. 
Finally, the retracking will presumably not be done on the 
peak  of  the  waveform  (which  is  known  to  be  an  unstable 
and  badly  localized  feature  of  the  reflected  signal)  but 
rather on its leading edge.  

For  these  reasons,  it  appears  necessary  to  re-assess  the 
matter  in  a  more  systematic  fashion,  using  appropriate 
tools from Estimation Theory. 

IV. 

CRAMER-RAO BOUND 

The  context  of  the  present  problem  is  Estimation  Theory. 
The  CRB  methodology  allows  predicting 
the  best 
achievable  performance  in  estimation  problems  for  which 
the  stochastic  nature  of  the  observation  can  be  described 
by a probability distribution function (PDF). Formally, the 
problem comes to estimate a parameter θ (e.g., the delay) 
from  a  random  observation  X  (the  complex  waveform,  a 
vector), knowing its PDF p(X,θ). Then, the RMS precision 

of  any  non-biased  estimator  of  θ  has  a  lower  bound  (see 
e.g. [Kay 1993]):

DIRECT SIGNAL RANGE PRECISION 

The RF signal received by the direct antenna can be seen 
as  an  attenuated  (α  factor)  and  delayed  (by  θ)  version  of 
the GNSS code C emitted by the transmitter, and corrupted 
by additive thermal noise σ b (where b is a complex zero-
mean  unit-variance  white-noise  Gaussian  random  process 
and σ a real scaling factor). The waveform is produced by 
correlating  this  input  signal  with  a  clean  replica  of  the 
GNSS  down-converted  signal,  leading  to  the  complex 
waveform

The CRB expression can now be compared to the state of 
the  art  model.  For  this  purpose,  Eq.  10  should  be  further 
simplified by adopting the assumptions that χ is a triangle 
function  and  that  only  three  points  of  the  waveform  are 
retained  for  retracking  (the  peak  and  its  two  immediate 
neighbours).  Doing  this,  we  recover  Eq.  2.  This  exercise 
illustrates  the  strength  of  the  CRB  approach  for  deriving 
generic  performance  expression  adaptable  to  a  particular 
algorithm and also proves that the Thomas estimator is an 
efficient  one  (i.e.  reaching  its  Cramer-Rao  bound)  in  the 
limit of high enough SNR. 

Figure 1 gives values of the direct signal (GPS C/A code) 
range  precision  as  a  function  of  1/SNR  (i.e.  NSR).  The 
waveform is sampled from -300m to 300m with a step of 
15m  (i.e. 20 MHz).  As  expected,  the  CRB  approach  is in 
full  agreement  with  the  state  of  the  art  model.  To  further 
validate  these  results,  we  have  performed  Monte-Carlo 
simulations.  Realizations  of  the  model  of  Eq.  6  have  been 
re-tracked using two estimators: the Maximum Likelihood 
Estimator  (MLE),  known  to  be  efficient,  and  the  Thomas 
algorithm. MLE results match well to the theoretical CRB, 
except  for  very  low  SNR  where  a  slight  departure  is 
observed.  As  expected,  the  Thomas  algorithm  is  efficient 
for high SNR but deviates from optimality at severe noise 
levels.

REFLECTED SIGNAL RANGE PRECISION 

The  expression  for  the  complex  reflected  waveform 
involves two contributions: one is the GNSS electric field

where  U  is  the  scattered  electric  field  and  u  the  electric

that  the  sea-surface  scattering  contribution  follows  fully-
developed  speckle  statistics,  that  is,  a  complex,  vectorial, 
zero-mean,  Gaussian  PDF.  Since  thermal  noise  is  also 
Gaussian,  the  reflected  complex  waveform  is  Gaussian 
distributed with parameters

EM  integral  equation  of  [Zavorotny  and  Voronovich,

emphasize  that  the  critical  feature  for  our  purpose  is  the 
waveform leading edge which is obtained by integration of 
sea-surface scatterers in the vicinity of the specular point. 
In  this  regime  and  from  space,  the  signal  covariance  is 
largely dominated by the radar ambiguity function, i.e. by 
the GNSS autocorrelation. In other words, we assume that 
the  antenna  pattern  and  the  glistening  zones  are  much 
larger  than  the  first-chip  zone.  In  addition,  we  simplify 
further  the  study  by  limiting  ourselves  to  reflections 
occurring  at  nadir.  Under

The impact of this result is now discussed. A simple error 
budget  is  assessed  for  two  generic  space  missions  and 
compared 
requirements  of  space  altimetry 
applications  potentially  suitable  for  GNSS-R.  The  two 
proposed  missions  receive  the  GPS  C/A  code  and  are 
characterized  by  their  altitude  (500  or  700  km)  and 
antenna  gain  (28  or  34  dB).  A  link  budget  model 
developed  elsewhere  [CNES  ALT  GNSSR,  2006]  allows 
computing  the  expected  thermal  SNR  and  the  coherence 
time  of  the  reflected  signal,  which  is  needed  to  compute 
the  number  of  independent  samples  in  one  second.  The 
altimetric precision is then derived according to Eq. 1.

~20  MHz).  The  re-assessment  leads  to  more  pessimistic 
results  than  in  previous  analyses:  typically,  the  range 
precision computed with the CRB approach is predicted ~4 
times worse. Besides, it is worth noting that the asymptotic 
range  precision  for  infinite  SNR  is  now  predicted  finite. 
Even  without  thermal  noise  (e.g.,  with  a  very  large 
antenna),  the  waveform  is  still  degraded  by  speckle  and 
this remains a limitation for delay estimation.

CONCLUSIONS 

In  this  paper, we  have  carried  out  a  critical  review of  the 
state  of  the  art  model  for  GNSS-R  range  precision.  The 
goal  was  to  revisit  the  baseline  assumption  (known  to  be 
incorrect)  that  reflected  and  direct  signals  can  be  treated 
the same. A rigorous evaluation of the problem, based on 
the Cramer-Rao Bound methodology, has been conducted. 
For  the  direct  signal,  we  have  obtained  results  in 
agreement  with  the  state  of  the  art,  as  expected.  For  the 
reflected signal, we have shown that precision degrades, as 
suspected. For instance, a mission receiving the C/A code 
at  500km  with  28dB  gain  would  have  a  1-second  range 
precision  of  1m  at  nadir.  This  is  due  to  the  impact  of 
speckle noise and the shape change in the reflected signal. 

These results question the suitability of a C/A code GNSS-
R mission focusing on mesoscale altimetry. The use of 1-
MHz  codes  (e.g.  GPS  C/A)  remains  acceptable  to  detect 
strong  tsunamis  (20  cm  over  100  km)  but  mesoscale 
oceanography (5 cm over 100 km) would be realistic only 
with 10-MHz codes (e.g., GPS P code). 

The  availability  of  such  signals  as  well  as  those  with  an 
even higher bandwidth (up to 50 MHz with the E5 signal) 
provided  by  the  European  Galileo  system  will  further 
increase  the  potential  of  this  technique  [Galileo  OS  SIS 
ICD, 2006]. 

Future  work  should  consolidate  these  results  with  more 
numerical  simulations  and  experimental  validation  either 
using space data or adapting the model to low altitudes and 
take  benefit  of  available  airborne/coastal  data.  Finally,  an 
in-depth  study  of  the  Galileo  signal  structure  impact  on 
GNSS-R is a very important future research line.

Abstract 
 
In  1953  Casimir  proposed  a  semiclassical  model  for  the  electron  based  on  the  concept 
that net inward radiation pressure from the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations fields (as 
in  the  Casimir  effect,  generally)  might  play  the  role  of  Poincare  stresses,  compensating 
outward coulomb pressure to yield a stable configuration at small dimensions.  Given that 
in  scattering  experiments  the  electron  appears  point-like,  critical  to  the  success  of  the 
proposed  model  is  demonstration  that  the  self-energy  corresponding  to  the  divergent 
coulomb  field  does  not  contribute  to  the  electron  mass.    Here  we  develop  a  self-
consistent,  vacuum-fluctuation-based  model  that  satisfies  this  requirement  and  thereby 
resolves  the  issue  of  what  would  otherwise  appear  to  be  an  incompatibility  between  a 
point-like electron and finite mass.

1. Introduction 

In  his  paper  “Introductory  Remarks  on  Quantum  Electrodynamics”  [1],  H.B.G. 
 
Casimir,  fresh  from  his  investigation  of  the  vacuum-fluctuation-driven  attractive  force 
between  conducting  plates  (the  Casimir  force),  proposed  a  semiclassical  model  of  the 
electron in the spirit of Lorentz’s theory of the electron [2].  Though such modeling is out 
of favor in terms of providing a realistic description of the quantum electron, nonetheless 
the potential for insights to emerge from such modeling remains seductive.  Along these 
lines Casimir suggested two models, the second of which has received little attention but 
is the subject of this short note. 
 
 
Casimir suggested that a dense shell-like distribution of charge might partially (as 
in the Casimir Effect, generally), or even wholly, suppress vacuum fields in the interior 
of the shell (Shell Models I and II, respectively).  This could result in net inward radiation 
pressure  from  the  EM  (electromagnetic)  vacuum  fluctuation  fields  (playing  the  role  of 
Poincare  stresses)  compensating  outwardly-directed  coulomb  forces  to  yield  a  stable 
configuration  at  small  dimensions.    From  the  modern  viewpoint,  for  such  semiclassical 
modeling  to  provide  useful  insight,  a  key  issue  to  be  resolved  is  that  although  in 
scattering  experiments  the  electron  appears  to  be  pointlike  and  structureless,  the  self-

energy  corresponding  to  the  (divergent)  coulomb  field  does  not  appear  to  contribute  to 
the electron mass.  In QED renormalization theory this is handled by adding an infinite 
negative  mass  term  to  compensate  the  infinite  positive  coulomb  term.    Though  such 
renormalization can be carried out in QED in an unambiguous and invariant way, from 
the standpoint of a semiclassical model it appears sufficiently ad hoc as to merit a search 
for an alternative. 
 
2. Casimir shell model I 
 
 
In Casimir’s Shell Model I, interior EM vacuum fluctuation fields associated with 
the discrete vacuum states permitted by boundary conditions are assumed to exist (as in 
the standard modeling of the Casimir Effect).  For this model a charge e is assumed to be 
homogeneously  distributed  on  the  surface  of  a  conducting  shell  of  vanishing  radius  a, 
whose  tendency  to  expand  by  coulomb  repulsion  is  checked  by  a  net  inwardly-directed 
vacuum fluctuation radiation pressure due to the pressure imbalance between interior and 
exterior vacuum modes.  Unfortunately for the model, detailed analyses showed that for 
this  case  the  Casimir  pressure  was  (surprisingly)  outwardly-directed,  augmenting  rather 
than  offsetting  the  coulomb  pressure,  thereby  falsifying  the  Casimir  Poincare  stress 
hypothesis for this case [3-6]. 
 
3. Casimir shell model II 
 
For Casimir’s Shell Model II, which we now discuss, the charge density is taken 
 
to be sufficiently dense in a vanishing-radius shell so as to result in the total absence of 
interior vacuum fluctuation fields as a singularity is approached.  The modeling for this 
case proceeds as follows: 
 
1. Consider charge e to be homogeneously distributed on a spherical shell of (vanishing) 
radius 
 
2. Under this assumption, the electric field E, given by 
 

a →  
0.

4. Discussion and conclusions 
 

Thus, for Casimir’s Shell Model II, the net contribution to the self-energy of the 
point-particle electron by the coulomb and vacuum fields vanishes.  We are therefore led 
to conclude that, under the set of assumptions applicable to Casimir’s Shell Model II, an 
inwardly-directed,  divergent,  electromagnetic  vacuum  fluctuation  radiation  pressure 
stably balances the divergent coulomb pressure.  Furthermore, it does so in such a manner 
that,  even  in  the  limiting  case  of  the  point  particle  electron,  no  contribution  to  the  self 
energy of the electron results from the divergent coulomb field.  Thus a key requirement 
for the semiclassical electron model is met.  As a result, to the degree that this result of 
the semiclassical analysis carries over to QED renormalization, it would appear that the 
additive  infinite  negative  mass  in  the  QED  approach  finds  its  source  in  a  negative 
vacuum  energy  contribution  as  proposed  in  the  Casimir  model.    Finally,  the  reality  of 
high-energy-density  vacuum  fluctuation  fields  at  the  fundamental  particle  level  is 
buttressed, while at the same time leading to a renormalization process compatible with a 
finite particle mass.

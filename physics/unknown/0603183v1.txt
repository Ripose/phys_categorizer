Abstract

Shear-thinning fluids exhibit surprisingly rich behaviour1. One example is the 

Kaye effect2 which occurs when a thin stream of a solution of polyisobutylene 

in  Decalin  is  poured  into  a  dish  of  the  fluid.  As  pouring  proceeds,  a  small 

stream  of  liquid  occasionally  leaps  upward  from  the  heap.  This  surprising 

effect,  which  lasts  only  a  second  or  so,  is  named  after  its  first  observer 

A. Kaye, who could offer no explanation for this behaviour. Later, Collyer and 

Fischer3  suggested  from  250 frames  per  second  cine  recordings  that  the  fluid 

must  be  highly  shear  thinning  as  well  as  elastic  and  ‘pituitous’*.  In  addition, 

they  concluded  that  a  rigid  surface  is  required  to  back  the  reflected  liquid 

stream.  While  the  words  bouncing  and  reflection  are  associated  with  non-

continuous and elastic effects, we will show here that the Kaye effect is in fact 

a continuous flow phenomenon. We show that the Kaye effect works for many 

common  fluids,  including  shampoos  and  liquid  soaps.  We  reveal  its  physical 

mechanism  (formation,  stability  and  disruption)  through  high-speed  imaging. 

The  measurements  are  interpreted  with  a  simple  theoretical  model  including 

only the shear thinning behaviour of the liquid; elastic properties of the liquid 

play  no  role.  We  show  that  the  Kaye  effect  can  be  stable  and  that  it  can  be 

directed.  We  even  demonstrate  a  stable  Kaye  effect  on  a  thin  soap  film 

excluding the necessity of a rigid backing surface.

A wide variety of materials show shear-thinning behaviour1, i.e. the viscosity of 

the  fluid  decreases  with  increasing  shear  rate.  Polymer  melts  and  polymer 

solutions4,  emulsions  and  dispersions5  are  classes  of  materials  which  often 

display  such  a  non-Newtonian  behaviour.  Examples  include  biological  fluids 

like blood and saliva and so-called synovial fluids found e.g. in the knee joint, 

food-engineered products like ketchup and yoghurt, cosmetic creams, gels and 

liquid  detergents  from  the  personal  care  industry  and  drilling  mud,  cement 

pastes and latex paints from the building and construction industry. All these 

fluids  have  in  common  that  they  are  stable  at  rest,  yet  in  their  specific 

application  their  resistance  to  flow  must  be  low.  Shear  thinning  is  related  to 

reversible structural break-down of the materials due to flow-induced stress.  

An extreme example of shear-thinning behaviour is the Kaye effect2, shown in 

Figure  1  (see  Supplementary  Information,  Video  S1–S4).  Here,  a  shear-

thinning  shampoo  is  poured  from  a  height  of  approximately  20 cm  in  a  thin 

stream  of  thickness  0.4  mm  and  visualized  using  a  high-speed  camera  at 

1000 frames per second. At first, the fluid will curl and wrinkle as any highly 

viscous  fluids  such  as  honey,  syrup  (see  Supplementary  Information,  Video 

S5)  or  silicone  oil  would  do6,7  forming  a  viscous  heap  (Fig. 1.1).  At  some 

instant, due to a favourable geometry, the incoming jet will slip away from the 

heap.  While  for  a  viscous  Newtonian  fluid  such  a  slip  would  only  lead  to  a 

small  disturbance  in  the  wrinkling  or  coiling  pattern,  in  the  shear-thinning 

shampoo  the  resulting  high  shear  rate  forms  a  low  viscosity  interface  leading 

to an expelled jet at low inclination (Fig. 1.2). Meanwhile the incoming jet will 

exert  a  vertical  force  on  the  viscous  heap  forming  a  dimple.  The  dimple 

deepens  because  of  the  sustained  force  exerted  onto  it  by  the  incoming  jet 

3

thereby  erecting  the  outward  going  jet  (Figs.  1.3-1.5).  The  inclination  of  the 

streamer steepens until it hits the incoming jet (Fig. 1.6) and disturbs or even 

interrupts the in-flow, thereby halting the Kaye effect. As will be shown later, 

during the jetting stage there is no net mass transport to the viscous heap and 

therefore the heap will slowly decay at a timescale of seconds. As soon as the 

jetting stops, the fluid will form a new heap from which a successive slip event 

can occur, repeating the series of events. 

A snapshot of a streamer ejecting from the viscous heap is shown in Fig. 1A. 

The ejected streamer generally has the shape of a lasso, with one end fixed to 

the viscous heap and the other end directly connected to the incoming jet. As 

the  in-flow  proceeds  the  lasso  extends,  leaving  a  stagnant  branch  and  a 

flowing branch of fluid (see Fig. 1B and Figs. 1.3 and 1.4). The flowing branch 

shoots  forward  and  remains  flowing.  One  striking  phenomenon  that  is 

observed  in  all  experiments  is  that  the  outgoing  jet  diameter  is  considerably 

larger  than  the  incoming  jet  diameter,  see  Fig. 1B,  indicating  a  lower  velocity 

of the leaping jet. The velocities of the incoming and outgoing jet, Vin and Vout,

were  measured  by  tracking  microbubbles  contained  in  the  transparent  fluid 

(see  e.g.  Supplementary  Information,  Video  S4  andS6).  The  diameter  of  the 

streamer 2Rout  is  found  to  be  thicker  to  that  of  the  incoming  jet  2Rin,

quantitatively  following  the  continuity  equation  VinR2

in=VoutR2

out.  The  lower 

velocity relates to viscous dissipation in the dimple structure, as will be shown 

later.  The  velocity  of  the  outgoing  streamer  as  it  leaves  the  heap  was 

determined  independently  by  measuring  the  profile  of  its  perfect  parabolic 

trajectory and these values were found to be in very good agreement.  

4

Upon  impact  the  incoming  jet  exerts  a  force  on  the  underlying  viscous  heap. 

From  the  vertical  component  of  the  velocities  the  momentum  transfer  was 

calculated. In our range of experiments the force was in the order of 5×10-3 N. 

The vertical force results in a spoon-like dimple structure, which facilitates the 

jet  to  leap  forward,  see  Fig.  2A  and  Supplementary  Information,  Video  S7. 

High-speed  imaging,  as  was  used  to  capture  this  image,  allows  for  a  detailed 

study of this fast event, yet the dimple structure is also visible to the unaided 

eye.  In  Collyer  and  Fischer’s  work3  the  steepening  trajectory  of  the  outgoing 

streamer  was  explained  by  a  collapse  of  the  heap  which  flattens,  thereby 

presenting a smaller angle of incidence to the incident stream and causing the 

‘bouncing’ streamer to steepen its trajectory. However, the current explanation 

of  a  continuous  flow  mechanism  and  the  formation  of  a  dimple  that  deepens 

with time discards this picture of a bouncing streamer. 

We investigated several conditions for the release height, width and velocity of 

the incoming jet for the occurrence of the Kaye effect. From these experiments 

it followed that for small release heights, where the incoming vertical speed of 

the liquid is relatively low, the liquid wrinkles like any viscous fluid would do. 

At  higher  incoming  velocities  (higher  release  heights)  the  liquid  stream  slides 

away to the side due to its shear-thinning property, however the expelled jet is 

rapidly  brought  to  a  standstill  due  to  viscous  dissipation  at  the  underlying 

surface. Then, by a small increase in the release height, the expelled streamer 

will  lead  to  the  formation  of  a  jet.  Such  a  critical  release  height  was 

consistently found for all studied mass flows. For even higher release heights, 

in  the  presence  of  a  jet,  we  always  observed  a  large  difference  between  leap 

height  and  release  height,  reflecting  that  a  considerable  amount  of  energy 

must be dissipated in the dimple.  

5

The dissipation mechanism in the dimple structure was captured in a simple 

energy  balance  model.  Our  model  assumes  a  thin  shear  layer  between  the 

flowing  fluid  and  the  viscous  heap.  At  the  high  shear  rates  present  in  the 

shear layer the viscosity of the shear-thinning fluid drops by several orders of 

magnitude. Nonetheless, some dissipation occurs through viscous friction. The 

model  described  here  calculates  the  incoming  power  and  the  dissipation  rate 

in the dimple structure. Then from the difference, the velocity and leap height 

can be obtained. Figure 2B shows the relevant parameters for this model. The 

power Pin of the incoming stream of fluid is determined by its mass flow m(cid:6)  and 

its  velocity  Vin  when  reaching  the  viscous  heap,

density of the fluid. Viscous friction between the flowing fluid and the stagnant 

heap  in  the  dimple  structure  (contact  length  L)  leads  to  energy  dissipation, 

hence to a loss in flow velocity. In the thin shear layer of thickness (cid:71) between 

the flowing fluid (velocity V) and the stagnant heap (velocity zero) we assume a 

linear  velocity  profile.  This  leads  to  a  constant  shear  rate 

/V(cid:74)
(cid:71)(cid:32)(cid:6)

,  which  in 

our  experiments  is  of  the  order  of 104  s–1.  The  shear  stress (cid:87)  in  the  layer  is 

then given by (cid:87) (cid:75)(cid:74)(cid:32) (cid:6) , where (cid:75) is the shear rate-dependent viscosity.  

The viscosities of the shear-thinning fluids used in this study were measured 

independently with a coaxial cylindrical rheometer, see Fig. 3, for shear rates 

up  to  103 s-1,  which  was  the  experimental  upper  limit  due  to  air  entrainment 

and  foam  formation.  In  the  thin  shear  layer  of  the  leaping  jet  (V = 1m/s, 

(cid:71)= 100(cid:80)m)  the  shear  rates  are  even  higher.  Therefore  we  extrapolate  the 

experimental  results  following  the  established  empirical  equation  given  by 

Cross8 :

where (cid:75)0 and (cid:75)(cid:146) represent the zero-shear-rate and infinite-shear-rate viscosity 

respectively,  and  where  the  critical  shear  rate  is  represented  by c(cid:74)(cid:6) .  Typical 

values  for  the  shear-thinning  liquids  used  in  this  study  were  (cid:75)0 = 5-10 Pa.s 

and c(cid:74)(cid:6) = 10-20  s-1;  the  exponent  n  approaches  unity  for  our  studied  liquids. 

The viscosity at infinite shear rate was taken that of water, (cid:75)(cid:146) = 1 mPa.s. The 

reason  for  this  is  that  the  long  soap  molecule  structures  that  build  up 

viscosity  at  rest  break  up  under  shear  and  in  the  limit  of  high  shear  rates 

become so small that we  basically end up  with a solution  containing isolated 

soap molecules. For the shear rates in our experiment we find

dissipation  in  a  dimple  of  length  L.  In  dimensional  quantities  the  threshold

Most importantly, this implies that in leading order the minimum velocity does 

not  depend  on  the  thickness  of  the  shear  layer (cid:71),  the  only  parameter  in  our 

model which cannot be well estimated from our experiments.

The  occurrence  of  the  Kaye  effect  was  studied  experimentally  by  varying  the 

release  height  between  5 cm  and  30  cm  for  a  mass  flow  of  0.05  g/s  and 

0.2 g/s. Figure 4A shows the measured leap height vs. release height (circles). 

It  is  seen  that  the  experimental  results  compare  well  with  the  model 

predictions.  The  model  contains  two  free  fit  parameters:  the  shear  layer 

thickness  (cid:71)  and  the  contact  length  within  the  dimple  structure  L.  In  the 

examples  shown  here (cid:71)  was  kept  at  100 (cid:80)m,  while  L  was  taken  3.8 mm  and 

5.5  mm  for  a  mass  flow  of  0.05 g/s  and  0.2  g/s,  respectively.  A  larger  mass 

flow  indeed  leads  to  a  larger  dimple  structure,  as  observed  in  experiment. 

Fig. 4B illustrates the corresponding power of the incoming jet, the dissipation 

rate  and  the  power  of  the  outgoing  jet  calculated  as  a  function  of  the  release 

height.  For  high  release  heights  the  incoming  power  exceeds  the  dissipation 

rate, leading to a successful leap. By lowering the release height the power of 

the  outgoing  jet  decreases  and  at  a  certain  point  becomes  zero.  This  defines 

the critical release height in the model; below this point no leaping occurs. 

One  observation  for  the  Kaye  effect  is  that,  as  it  develops  (following  e.g. 

Fig. 1.1-1.6),  the  dimple  in  the  viscous  heap  deepens.  Therefore  the  contact 

length  increases  from  its  initial  optimum  contact  length  to  larger  and  larger 

values, thereby increasing the dissipation. The increase in dissipation rate can 

also  be  modelled  and  continues  until  it  reaches  a  critical  value  equal  to  the 

incoming  power, thereby halting the Kaye effect. This  mechanism is observed 

experimentally  in  several  occasions.  The  principal  disruptive  mechanism  to 

end the Kaye effect, however, is that of the physical interaction of the outgoing 

and the incoming jets. This however can be prevented altogether, as discussed 

in the following.  

9

The conventional setup for the Kaye effect has the disadvantage that, because 

of  its  geometry,  the  erected  outgoing  jet  interferes  with  the  incoming  jet 

leading  to  a  disruption  of  the  Kaye  effect  (see  Fig.  1.6).  By  tilting  the  bottom 

surface we succeeded in constructing a system displaying a stable Kaye effect 

which  lasts  for  many  minutes.  A  photograph  of  this  system  is  shown  in 

figure 5.  The  surface  is  covered  with  a  thin  film  of  the  same  material  flowing 

from a small reservoir on top. The starting principle of the stable Kaye effect is 

similar to that of the fluid falling on the horizontal plate. The outgoing jet may 

originally  eject  in  any  arbitrary  direction,  however,  the  jet  will  always  orient 

itself  in  the  direction  downward  along  the  surface,  as  this  will  minimize  the 

contact  length  and  therefore  the  dissipation.  The  expelled  jet  lands  on  the 

coated surface and as the jet steepens the inclination angle increases, leading 

to  a  secondary  Kaye  effect.  This  process  can  repeat  itself  several  times  along 

the  inclined  plane  and  we  have  been  able  to  create  a  cascading  Kaye  effect 

with  up  to  seven  leaps.  The  cascading  effect  is  also  very  stable.  It  is  the 

balance  of the incoming power and the cumulative viscous  dissipation within 

each dimple which eventually terminates the cascade after a finite number of 

steps.

We investigated the necessity of several conditions for the Kaye effect to occur, 

starting with the presence of a backing plane. We found that a rigid backplane 

is  not  required  for  a  support  of  the  Kaye  effect.  This  was  demonstrated  by 

pouring a thin stream of shear-thinning fluid on top of a deep container filled 

with  the  same  material.  We  found  no  difference  with  a  Kaye  effect  performed 

on  a  flat  backing  plane.  We  even  tried  and  successfully  created  a  Kaye  effect 

on  a  thin  liquid  soap  film,  as  demonstrated  in  figure  6A.  The  soap  film  was 

stretched  across  a  thin  metal  wire  of  rectangular  shape,  the  film  thickness 

10

being  approximately  50 (cid:80)m.  Shear  thinning  liquid  soap  was  poured  from  a 

height  of  20  cm  and  interestingly,  also  in  this  case  the  fluid  leaps.  When  the 

plane of the film was inclined the Kaye effect was stabilized (as in the case of 

the  cascade)  and  could  be  directed.  The  effect  continues  for  several  minutes, 

or  as  long  as  the  soap  film  lasts  through  film  drainage.  As  this  setup  is 

optically thin it allows for a detailed study of the jet bending structure, see Fig. 

6B and Supplementary Information, Video S8. First, the jet curvature and its 

thickness (directly related to its velocity) can be deduced. Secondly, the forces 

exerted  by 

the  supporting  structure  can  be  studied 

through  our 

understanding  of  thin  film  curvature,  surface  tension  and  corresponding 

normal forces. Finally, not studied in detail at present, normal stresses of the 

rheological material may also account in part for the support of the bending of 

the incoming jet. In any case, these experiments disprove the claim of Collyer 

and Fischer3 that a rigid backing plane is required for the Kaye effect.  

Conservation  of  mass  was  demonstrated  before  based  on  the  velocities  and 

radii  of  the 

incoming  and  outgoing  streamers.  Continuity  was  also 

demonstrated  in  an  experiment  with  two  similar  shear-thinning  fluids,  one 

being  transparent,  the  other  being  white  opaque.  The  transparent  fluid 

functioned  as  the  supporting  base  substance  while  the  opaque  one  was 

poured  on  top  of  it.  From  these  experiments  it  followed  that  no  mixing 

occurred  and  that  the  two  fluids  in  fact  remain  separated.  This  was  also 

demonstrated  in  another  way  by  using  the  fluid  streamers  as  laser  light 

guides.  In  a  setup  with  a  transparent  fluid  laser  light  from  a  Helium-Neon 

laser  beam  was  introduced  through  the  nozzle  opening.  The  vertical  stream 

then acts as a liquid laser light guide, as the total internal reflection at the free 

interface keeps the laser light contained in the fluid. While the stream ends up 

11

in  a  viscous  heap  the  laser  light  will  escape  from  it  as  the  angle  is  in  many 

cases  smaller  than  the  critical  angle.  It  will  therefore  brightly  illuminate  the 

heap, see Fig. 7A. During the occurrence of the Kaye effect we observe that the 

laser light remains within the outgoing streamer (Fig. 7B) (see Supplementary 

Information,  Video  S9).  The  light  now  escapes  at  the  position  where  the 

outgoing  streamer  ends,  in  the  cascading  Kaye  effect  this  can  be  after  five 

consecutive  leaps  or  more  (see  Supplementary  Information,  Video  S10).  The 

fact  that  the  laser  light  does  not  penetrate  to  the  viscous  heap  indicates  the 

structural changes of the fluid through shear in the thin shear layer. The laser 

detection method therefore shows that the flowing stream is in fact decoupled 

from  the  viscous  heap,  both  in  an  optical  sense  as  well  as  in  a  fluid 

mechanical sense. 

In conclusion, and in contrast to what has previously been reported, the Kaye 

effect  is  comprised  of  the  efficient  bending  of  a  low-viscosity  liquid  jet  by  a 

favourable  spoon-like  dimple  formed  in  a  viscous  heap  of  fluid.  For  a  highly 

shear-thinning  fluid,  such  as  those  used  in  our  study,  these  two  conditions 

can develop within the same liquid.

Figure  1. The  Kaye  effect  for  leaping  shampoo.  Top  row:  Six  snapshots  of  a 

shear-thinning  fluid  (shampoo)  showing  the  Kaye  effect2.  The  images  were 

recorded  with  a  digital  high-speed  camera  operating  at  1000  frames  per 

second. (1) Formation of a viscous heap through piling, buckling and coiling at 

t = 0 ms. (2) Ejection of a thin streamer of fluid initiates the Kaye effect at t = 

30 ms. (3-5)  The jet rises at t = 70 ms, 160 ms, 280  ms. (6)  The outgoing jet 

disrupts the incoming jet which leads to its collapse and the end of the Kaye 

effect  at  t = 380  ms.  Note  that  the  viscous  heap  decays  at  a  relatively  slow 

timescale  (order  1  second).  See  Supplementary  Information,  Video  S3.  

A.  Inception  of  the  Kaye  effect.  A  streamer  slips  away  from  the  viscous  heap. 

One part of the lasso is connected to the viscous heap, therefore it cannot flow 

and it will drop onto the bottom surface (see B). The other part of the lasso is 

directly connected and fed by the incoming streamer and it will therefore flow 

ahead. See Supplementary Information, Video S4. 

Figure  2.  Dimple  structure  in  the  viscous  heap.    A.  High-speed  recording 

showing the dimple structure (exposure time 150 µs). It is seen here that the 

flow  is  continuous.  Note  the  difference  in  radii  of  the  incoming  and  outgoing 

streamer.  The  viscous  heap  and  stagnant  part  of  the  initial  lasso  have 

meanwhile  decayed.  See  Supplementary  Information,  Video  S6  and  S7.

Figure 3. Viscosity versus shear rate for a typical fluid used in our experiments 

measured  in  a  coaxial  cylindrical  rheometer  (dots).  The  graph  clearly  shows 

the shear thinning properties of the fluid. The well-known problem of foaming 

prevents measurements above a shear rate of 103 s-1, but the high shear rate 

behaviour can be extrapolated using the established empirical equation given 

by  Cross8  (solid  line).  This  particular  graph  was  fitted  with  the  following 

parameters:  a  zero-shear-rate  viscosity  (cid:75)0 = 6.0  Pa.s,  an  infinite-shear-rate 

viscosity  of  (cid:75)(cid:102)  =  1  mPa.s  (fixed  to  the  viscosity  of  water),  a  critical  shear 

rate c(cid:74)(cid:6) = 18 s-1 and an exponent of n = 1 (thin grey line indicates a slope of -1). 

Figure 4. A. Experimental leap height versus release height for a mass flow of 

0.05 g/s (red filled circles) and 0.2 g/s (blue open circles). The lines represent 

the  modelled  leap  height  as  a  function  of  the  release  height  using  the 

parameters  given  in  B.  B.  Power  diagram  for  the  Kaye  effect.  The  incoming, 

dissipated  and  outgoing  (leaping)  power  plotted  as  a  function  of  the  release 

height for a mass flow of 0.05 g/s (red solid line) and 0.2 g/s (blue dotted line). 

At the critical height, indicated  by the thin vertical lines, the incoming  power 

equals the dissipated power. Calculations are based on a shear layer thickness 

of  100 (cid:80)m  and  a  contact  length  of  3.8 mm  and  5.5  mm  for  a  mass  flow  of 

0.05 g/s and 0.2 g/s, respectively.  

Figure  5.  Cascading  and  stable  Kaye  effect.  This  phenomenon  occurs  on  an 

inclined  plane  prepared  with  a  thin  film  of  the  same  material.  The  fluid  was 

found to leap  at up to  7 times.  In addition, this effect was found to be stable 

and lasted up to ten minutes which was as long as the reservoir was supplying 

a stable incoming stream of fluid.

demonstrated for a thin jet of a shear-thinning fluid (liquid hand soap) leaping 

off a 50 µm thin film of the same material. The film is locally deformed by the 

forces exerted onto it by the bending jet, however the surface tension is strong 

enough to keep the film intact. B. As the film is optically thin this stable setup 

reveals  the  important  physical  parameters  and  mechanisms  for  the  Kaye 

effect. See Supplementary Information, Video S8.    

Figure  7.  Laser  light  guide  experiment  for  the  Kaye  effect.  Laser  light  from  a 

Helium-Neon  laser  was  introduced  into  a  transparent  shear  thinning  fluid 

through the nozzle opening of the reservoir. A. The laser light illuminates the 

viscous  heap  as  the  streamer  terminates  inside  the  heap.  B.  For  the  Kaye 

effect the light is transported away from the heap within the outgoing streamer 

indicating the continuity of the jet. See Supplementary Information, Video S9 

and S10.

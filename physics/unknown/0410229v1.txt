    Abstr act 

  Characteristics of ion acceleration in the internal magnetic reconnection events (IRE) have been studied 
by means of a neutral particle energy analyzer (NPA) in Tokyo Spherical Tokamak (TST-2). The major and 
minor radii are 0.38 m and 0.25m, respectively. The magnetic field strength is 0.3T and the maximum 
plasma current is up to 140 kA. The electron and ion temperatures are 0.4 – 0.5 keV and 0.1 keV, 
respectively and the electron density is ~1x1019 m-3. The NPA can be scanned toroidally from (cid:84) (cid:32) 74° (cw) 
to (cid:84) (cid:32) 114° (ccw), where (cid:84) (cid:32) 90° corresponds to the perpendicular sightline. The direction of the plasma 
current is cw. The NPA signals are digitized at every 50 (cid:80)s. The NPA is calibrated in the energy range of 
0.1 keV < E    < 8.4 keV.   
  When the IRE occurs, it is observed that the plasma current increases by ~ 20% and the loop voltage 
drops from 0.6 V to – 5 V for ~ 0.1 ms. The enhanced charge exchange flux is observed by more than one 
order of magnitude at ~ 1 keV for this reconnection phase. The ion temperature increases by 80 eV at IREs. 
The angle (cid:84) dependence of increment of Ti shows that (cid:39)Ti ((cid:84) (cid:32) 74°) is higher than that for (cid:84) (cid:32) 114°. This 
observation suggests that an ion is accelerated initially in the direction of magnetic field lines.    The time 
evolution of the ion distribution function is simulated with a Fokker–Planck code taking into account the 
electric field effects.

1.  Introduction 
 
An  internal  reconnection  event  (IRE)[1]  is  one  of  the  interesting  MHD  phenomenon  in  ST 
plasmas. In ref. [1] characteristics of the IRE are a rapid current rise, an  increase  in the soft 
X-ray  signal  at  the  peripheral  chords,  visible  light  spikes,  and  MHD  activities.  The  current 
rise  can  be  as  much  as  40%  of  the  peak  current. From  the  precursor oscillations  with  m=1, 
where  m  is  the  poloidal  mode  number,  it  is  explained  that  a  flattening  of the  current  profile 
leads to large current increases. 
One  of  the  interesting  aspects  which  are  considered  to  be  related  with  astrophysical 
phenomena,  such  as  solar  flare  or  solar  wind,  is  plasma  heating  during  the  magnetic  filed 
reconnection.  Actually  in  STs  strong  ion  heating  has  been  observed  [2].  In  MAST  the 
formation  of  suprathermal  deuterium  and  hydrogen  populations  even  in  Ohmic  plasmas 
following  IRE  was  observed  by  a  neutral  particle  energy  analyzer.  For  the  hydrogen  beam 
injection at 40 keV into a deuterium plasma, similar tail component of deuterium ions are also 
observed  and  it  has  been  explained  that  one  mechanism  is  that  of  large  angle  scattering 
process. 
Recently  Helander  [3]  proposed  that  high-energy  tail  appeared  in  the  ion  distribution 
function  following IREs  is clearly associated with reconnection and  it can be explained as a 
manifestation  of  runaway  acceleration  in  the  parallel  electric  filed  associated  with 
reconnection.     
In  a  spherical  tokamak  TST-2  [4],  ion  heating  has  been  also  observed  in  Ohmic  plasma. 
Although  several  types  of  MHD  events  are  found,  IREs  are  categorized  as  “strong  MHD 
events”  having  a  clear  positive  current  spike.  A  marked  phenomenon  during  a  strong  MHD 
event  is  found  that the  impurity  CV  temperature increases  ~570  eV  significantly  during  the 
events  and  then  decays  to  the  level  (~98  eV)  before  the  event.  They  used  a  visible 

spectrometer  equipped  with  11  channels  photomultiplier  and  the  Doppler  broadening  of  CV 
line  was  measured  with  10  (cid:80)s  resolution  time.  This  measurement  was  done  along  the 
perpendicular  viewing  chord  to  the  magnetic  filed  lines  and  bulk  hydrogen  ion  temperature 
was not measured. Before event the relaxation time between impurity ions and hydrogen ions 
is ~ 10 (cid:80)s, but during and after that it increases 30 ~ 250 (cid:80)s depending on the temperature rise 
and density drop. Although the released amount of the poloidal  magnetic  filed energy  is  not 
inconsistent  with  the  increment  of  the  ion  energy,  heating  mechanism  and  bulk  hydrogen 
behavior have been left to be resolved.         
  Recently  the  neutral  particle  energy  analyzer  NPA  was  installed  to  TST-2  and  the  ion 
distribution  function  was  measured  during  the  “strong  MHD  events”.  In  order to obtain  the 
ion distribution function in phase space the NPA can be scanned with respect to the magnetic 
file  line.  In  this  paper  the  experimental  results  of  the  NPA  associated  IREs  and  numerical 
results  of  time  dependent  Fokker-Planck  simulation  taking  into  account  the  electric  field 
induced by IREs will be presented.

2.  Experimental apparatus 
 
TST-2 [5] is the spherical tokamak whose parameters are as follows: major radius R~ 0.38 m, 
minor radius a ~ 0.25 m, aspect ratio A ~ 1.6, elongation (cid:78) (cid:100) 1.8, toroidal magnetic filed Bt ~ 
0.3  T,  plasma  current~  0.14  MA  and  discharge  duration  tpulse  ~  0.04  s.  IREs  in  TST2  are 
usually observed, particularly during the current decay phase in Ohmic phase. Observations of 
the current positive spikes and negative loop voltage spikes suggest a flattening of the current 
density  profile.  The  line  averaged  density  decreases  and  the  H(cid:68)  emission  increases  abruptly 
during an IRE, indicating a significant particle loss [4, 5].   
Figure 1 shows the top view and cross section of the TST-2 and arrangement of NPA. The 
typical  magnetic  surfaces  are  also  shown.  Visible  light  measurement  and  soft  X-ray 
measurement are done. In addition to these four sets of soft X-ray arrays are installed to study 
the MHD activity of IREs. 
  NPA  is  used  to  detect  neutral  particles  coming  from  plasma  via  charge  exchange  process 
between  hydrogen  atom  and  proton.  This  system  consists  of  drift  tube,  stripping  gas  cell, 
parallel  electro static plates and detectors. The pressure  in the analyzer  is kept below 1(cid:117)10-5 
torr  by  a  turbo  molecular  pump.  The  ceratron  is  used  as  a  detector  and  is  operated  in  pulse 
count mode. Signals are digitized by a camac scaler at every 50 - 200 (cid:80)s. The energy range is 
from  0.3  keV  to  2.1  keV.  The  energy  spectrum  can  be  obtained  on  shot-to-shot  basis 
assuming the discharge reproducibility. The viewing chord is 2 cm above the midplane. The 
NPA  can  be  scanned  with  respect  to  the  toroidal  magnetic  filed  from  74(cid:113)  (clockwise 
direction) to 114(cid:113)(counterclockwise direction). Here the angles are defined as that determined 
at the magnetic axis. The tangent radii are 0.19 m  and 0.12m, respectively. Here the plasma 
current  flows  in  the  clockwise  direction.  The  former  detects  co-moving  ions  and  the  latter 

ctr-moving  ions.  Since  the  passive  NPA  measurement  is  a  line  integration  of  the  CX  flux 
originated at each location along the line of sight, the pitch angle is not determined uniquely. 
With  assumptions  of  ni(r)=  ni(0)  (1-(r/a)2)0.5  and  n0(r)=  n0(0)  (r/a)2  the  most  dominant  pitch 
angle of the detected CX flux at E=0.9 keV is calculated. ni(0)  is assumed 1(cid:117)1019 m-3. Two 
maxima  correspond  to  77(cid:113) (near  position)  and  67(cid:113)  (far  position)  for  the  clockwise  chord of 
74(cid:113)  and  the  minimum  pitch  angle  is  56(cid:113)  .  Four  maxima  exist  along  the  counterclockwise 
direction of 114(cid:113), however, and they correspond to 109(cid:113)(near position), 123(cid:113) (inboard region), 
205(cid:113)(far  inboard  region  over  the  tangent  point)  and  245(cid:113)(far  outboard region),  respectively. 
The fractions of the flux normalized at the near position are 0.4, 0.2, 0.06, respectively.

IREs in TST-2 are shown in Fig. 2. The multi-channel 
soft X-ray arrays are used to follow IRE. The precursor 
oscillations  with  an  m=1/n=1  mode  are  found  to  be 
associated  with  some  instability  triggering  IRE.  The 
position  of  the  safety  factor  q=1  surface  is  deduced  at 
r/a~  0.5  from  the  SX  measurement  and  is  consistent 
with  the  equilibrium  calculations.  The  current  profile 
broadening 
is  suggested  by  positive  current  and 
negative  loop  voltage  spikes.  At  IREs  the  bursts  of 
NPA signal are also observed. The different point from 
the MAST results [3] is that this data is taken along the 
line  of  sight  perpendicular  to the  magnetic  filed  lines. 
At  t=38.1  ms  Ip  rises  20%  and  Vloop  drops  by  -5  V. 
Although  the  NPA  flux  corresponds  to  H(cid:68) bursts,  the 
enhancement  factor  is  quite  large  for  NPA  compared 
with  a  factor  of  two  enhancement  of  H(cid:68)(cid:17)  Thus  it  is 
considered that ions are heated during IREs.   
  Ion temperature evolution is shown in Fig.3 for three 
(cid:84) pitch. Ti is ~ 100 eV before IREs and is comparable to 
the  CV  temperature  [4].  When  IRE  occurs,  Ti  along 
the line of (cid:84) pitch = 74(cid:113) reaches 180 eV. In order to avoid statistical variation the CX counts are 
summed  for  0.2  ms  and  then  Ti  is  determined.  The  temperature  rise  (cid:39)Ti  is  plotted  as  a 
function of (cid:84) pitch obtained in several reproducible shots, as shown in Fig. 4. Scattering of (cid:39)Ti 
is  ascribed  to  variations  in  IREs  ((cid:39)Ip/Ip    or  Vloop).  (cid:39)Ti  is  highest  for  (cid:84)  pitch=74(cid:113)  and  it  is 
surprised  that  (cid:39)Ti for  (cid:84) pitch=90(cid:113)      and  114(cid:113)    show  positive.  This  is  a  quite  different  point 
from the MAST results [3]. For the perpendicular line of sight they measured no temperature 
rise during IREs.   
In Fig. 5 the increment in CX flux is plotted as a function of expanded time during and after 
IRE.  Here  t=0  ms  is  defined  as  the  time  at  which  the  CX  flux  starts  to  increase.  For 
comparison Vloop is also shown as a monitor of IRE. The decay time of the NPA flux at E=0.6 
keV is ~ 0.5 ms, which is roughly equal to the ion slowing down time.

(cid:23)(cid:17) Simulation results 
 
Furth  and  Rutherford  have  reported  in  ref.  [6]  that  ion  runaway  occurs  when  the  toroidal 
electric  filed  satisfies  a  certain  condition 
  ,  where  E*  is  the  effective 
(cid:33)
electric field, Ec the Dreicer field, me the electron mass and Mi mass of bulk ions, respectively. 
This condition is satisfied during the IRE in TST-2. The electric field is calculated ~ 45 V/m 
from  the  equilibrium  code  with  measured  magnetic  probe  signals  and  an  assumed  pressure 
profile. In order to analyze the ion acceleration a bounce averaged FP code [7] is used. In this 
code  electrons,  hydrogen  ions  and  oxygen  impurity  are  dealt  and  their  temperatures  are 
assumed  550  eV,  100  eV  and  100  eV,  respectively.  Initial  distribution  functions  are 
Maxwellian.  The  time  period  during  which  E//  of  45  V/m  is  produced  along  the  v//  axis  for 
0.15  ms  is  assumed  and  f(v//,  v(cid:65),t)  is  followed  during  that  period  and  after  that.  Figure  6 
shows  f(v//,  v(cid:65))  at t=0.15  ms,  just  end  of  acceleration.  Dashed,  dot-dashed  and  dotted  lines 
are numerical ones and correspond to the measured results taken at (cid:84) pitch =74(cid:113), 90(cid:113), and 110(cid:113), 
respectively.  Here  the  initial  f(v//,  v(cid:65))  at t=0  ms,  denoted  by  solid  line,  is  chosen  to  fit  the 
measured  one  before  the  IRE.  Figure  7  shows  the  contour  of  f(v//,  v(cid:65))  at  t=0.15  ms.  Thus 
simulations show a clear shift of the center and ion heating is found along (cid:84)pitch(cid:32)(cid:26)(cid:23)(cid:113) and ion 
cooling along (cid:84)pitch(cid:32)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:23)(cid:113). The result for (cid:84)pitch(cid:32)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:113) remained unchanged.   
The experimental results show significant heating. It should be noted that the NPA signal is 
the line integrated one, therefore along the sight of line ions in the acceleration region and in 
the deceleration region are recorded. For (cid:84)pitch(cid:32)(cid:26)(cid:23)(cid:113) the NPA can view  ions  having (cid:84)pitch(cid:32)(cid:26)(cid:23)(cid:113) 
only  if  they  are  on  the  magnetic  axis.  The  spatial  effects  should  be  considered  to  compare 
observations  with  numerical  results.  For  (cid:84)pitch(cid:32)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:113),  however,  the  line  of  sight  is  always 
perpendicular to the magnetic field line. Therefore observed ion heating is not consistent with 
the  numerical  result.  According  to the  loop  voltage  analysis  done  in  MAST  [3], the  electric 
filed  is  much  larger  in  the  center of  the  plasma  than  at the  edge,  and the  sign  of  it  is  in  the 
parallel to Ip at the center where the current drops, but it is reversed at the inboard side where 
the  current  rises.  Since  NPA  signals  along  (cid:84)pitch(cid:32)  114(cid:113)  detect  ions  near  the  inboard  edge, 
where  the  negative  voltage  is  expected  to  be  induced  and  ions  can  be  accelerated  in  the 
anti-parallel  to  Ip.  If  this  effect  dominates  ions  accelerating  in  the  parallel  direction,  the 
apparent  accelerated  spectrum  is  also  possible.  H(cid:68)  measurement  shows  the  enhancement  at 
the  inboard  edge,  therefore  the  enhanced  cx  flux  is  possibly  expected  along  this  chord.  For 
(cid:84)pitch(cid:32)(cid:26)(cid:23)(cid:113)  this  is  not  true.  Another  possible  explanation  is  a  mechanism  of  acceleration 
perpendicular  to  the  magnetic  filed  line.  Taking  into  account  the  spacial  structure  of 
reconnection, induced electric filed and the NPA line of sight will be left in future.

5. Discussion and Summary 
 
The CX flux measurements have been performed in TST-2 spherical tokamak. It shows bursts 
corresponding  to  IRE.  This  aspect  is  similar  to  that  observed  in  MAST.  Ion  temperature  is 
increased  from  ~  100eV  to  180  eV  for  co-  moving  ions,  which  is  accelerating  direction. 
Increment in Ti is sustained for ~ 0.5 ms, which is much longer than the slowing down time 
and  rather  order of  energy  confinement  time.  The  equilibrium  calculation  gives  the  toroidal 
electric filed of 45 V/m, which satisfies the ion runaway condition. The numerical simulation 
by the time dependent bounce averaged Fokker-Planck code shows that the ion acceleration is 
possible even for 0.15 ms, which is the order of IRE duration.   
  There are two unresolved problems; namely ion heating perpendicular to the magnetic filed 
and  anti-parallel  to  the  magnetic  filed.  This  is  not  expected  by  the  toroidal  electric  induced 
during reconnection and related ion runaway mechanism. Although the pitch angle scattering 
time  is  ~  0.2  ms  at  0.7  keV  ions,  a  clear  sequential  acceleration  is  not  observed  in  the  CX 
fluxes.    Large angel scattering rather than multiple small angle scattering or the excitation of 
the  waves  heating  ions  during  the  IREs  are  possible  candidates  [3].  For  the  anti-parallel 
acceleration, it should be considered that the line of sight and the negative electric filed at the 
inboard region contribute apparent acceleration along this chord. The critical electric  field  is 
evaluated  0.7  V/m  at  the  center,  which  accelerates  ions  in  the  co-direction.  Although  the 
negative electric filed is much low and is induced near the edge, this field also satisfies the ion 
runaway condition if ne/Te near the edge is the same as the center. If this is true, accelerated 
ions  can  be  detected  along  this  line  of  sight.  Coupled  the  equilibrium  calculation  with  2D 
Fokker  Planck  calculations  and  numerical  integration  of  f(v)  along  the  line  of  sight  are 
underway.

Abstract

Photostimulated  electron  detachment  from  aqueous  inorganic  anions  is  the

simplest  example  of  solvent-mediated  electron  transfer.  As  such,  this  photoreaction

became  the  subject  of  many  ultrafast  studies.  Most  of  these  studied  focussed  on  the

behavior of halide anions, in particular, iodide, that is readily accessible in the UV. In this

study,  we  contrast  the  behavior  of  these  halide  anions  with  that  of  small  polyatomic
anions,  such  as  pseudohalide  anions  (e.g.,    HS-)  and  common  polyvalent  anions  (e.g.,

own; photodetachment from polyatomic, especially polyvalent, anions follows a different

set of rules.

1. Introduction.

In Part I of this series, 1 quantum yields (QYs) for hydrated electrons generated by

photoinduced electron detachment from various aqueous anions have been determined.

Most of these anions exhibit the distinctive charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) band in

their UV absorption spectra that implicated the involvement of a short-lived excited state
(CTTS state) mediating electron photodetachment. 2,3 Following the dissociation of this

CTTS state, a geminate pair of the electron and the residual radical (such as hydroxyl for
HO- and iodine atom for I-) is formed in less than 200 fs. Some of these geminate pairs

recombine (typically, within 0.5-1 ns), while the rest escape to the solvent bulk, yielding

"free"  electrons  and  radicals  that  undergo  slow  recombination  and  other  secondary
reactions. 4-11 The electron yields given by Sauer et al. 1 are those for free electrons that

escaped recombination with their geminate partners. Such results per  se are of limited

import  for  understanding  the  photophysics  of  electron  detachment  in  solution  because

this yield is a product of two factors: the prompt quantum yield for electron formation
and the survival probability  Ω∞ of the resulting geminate pair. 1,4,10 The latter parameter

can be determined by time-resolved measurement on a sub-nanosecond time scale. For

many aqueous anions, such a measurement requires a pulsed source of ultraviolet (UV) or
vacuum  UV  light,  2  and  ultrafast  pump-probe  studies  of  these  photosystems  has  only

recently become possible.

This  study  pursued  three  objectives:  (i)  to  extend  previous  observations  of
electron dynamics in photoexcited halide anions  4-6 and hydroxide  10 to other common

CTTS anions, including polyvalent ones, (ii) to find the effect of the photon energy on
these electron dynamics (extending our detailed study of iodide  6 to  other  anions);  and

(iii) to determine the prompt QY for several classes of aqueous anions. Importantly, we

limit ourselves to one-photon excitation of these anions. Due to different selection rules,

the  photophysics  of  biphotonic  excitation  is  different  from  that  of  monophotonic

excitation (e.g., ref. 10).

− )
To  achieve  these  goals,  recombination  dynamics  of  hydrated  electrons  ( eaq

generated by 200 nm photoexcitation of several aqueous anions were observed and these

3

kinetic data and photo- and actino- metric measurements were used to obtain directly the

prompt quantum yield for the formation of thermalized electrons. Previously, such yields
had been estimated for two halide anions only, I-  and  Br-,  and  were  found  to  be  unity
across their lower energy CTTS subband. 4,12 In this work, we present a larger pattern of

these QYs. Our results suggest that polyatomic anions generally have QYs substantially

lower  than  unity.  Furthermore,  some  of  these  QYs  systematically  increase  with  the

excitation energy from the very onset of the CTTS band, possibly due to the involvement

of non-CTTS photoexcitation and/or side photochemical reactions.

The  geminate  recombination  kinetics  obtained  for  200  nm  photoexcitation  of

several aqueous anions were compared with pump-probe kinetics obtained for the same

anions at lower photoexcitation energy (242 nm or 225 nm). Two models of geminate
recombination in the CTTS photosystems, the free diffusion model 13 and the mean force
potential (MFP) model, 4,10,11 were used to analyze these data sets. This analysis suggests
that for aqueous anions other than halides and simple pseudohalides (such as OH- and
HS-), the initial spatial distribution of photogenerated electrons has a broad component,

regardless of the photoexcitation energy. These results generalize our observations for
aqueous I-  4,6 and observations of Barthel and Schwartz for Na- in ethers. 8 The narrow

component  in  this  distribution  originates  from  the  dissociation  of  the  precursor  CTTS

state which proceeds through a succession of localized electron states. Such a picture has

been suggested and corroborated by quantum molecular dynamics calculations carried
out by several research groups. 14,15,16 It is not clear from our kinetic data whether this

type of a photoprocess occurs for polyvalent anions, -- and possibly for some polyatomic
monovalent anions, such as CSN-.

Direct  promotion  of  the  electron  from  a  photoexcited  anion  to  the  conduction

band of the solvent is a possible cause for the occurrence of the broad component in the

electron distribution at higher photon energy. It is well known that in photoionization of

solvent and/or neutral solute molecules in polar and nonpolar liquids, the width of the

electron distribution increases with the photoexcitation energy (e.g., ref. 17). This trend

can be accounted for by a longer thermalization path for the conduction band electrons

(emitted in the course of the direct ionization) as their kinetic energy increases. Electron

4

photodetachment from aqueous halide anions broadly conforms to the behavior expected

for  this  photoionization  mechanism:  there  is  a  threshold  energy  for  the  electron

distribution  broadening  (corresponding  to  the  onset  of  electron  promotion  to  the

conduction band) and systematic increase in the width of the electron distribution with
the total energy of photoexcitation, as observed by Bradforth and co-workers. 6

In  other  cases  (e.g.,  in  low  energy  photoionization  of  water),  18,19  different

mechanisms are in play. Indeed, the energetics of this photoionization are such that it can

not  involve  these  conduction  band  electrons;  yet  the  resulting  electron  distribution  is

quite broad (ca. 1 nm width). Many theories of this low energy photoprocess have been

suggested (see ref. 19 for a brief review). The current favorite is rapid electron transfer

from  photoexcited  water  molecule  to  a  "pre-existing"  trap  in  the  solvent  bulk  (this
reaction is thought to be concerted with ultrafast deprotonation of the resulting hole). 20

Our results for photo-CTTS reactions of aqueous polyatomic anions suggest that a similar

photoprocess  may  occur  in  the  course  of  electron  photodetachment  from  such  anions:

there  appear  to  exist  a  reaction  path  that  yields  a  relatively  broad  initial  electron

distribution without the involvement of the conduction band of the solvent.

2. Experimental.

200  nm  photoexcitation.  The  pico-  and  femto-  second  kinetic  measurements  reported

below were obtained using a 1 kHz Ti:sapphire setup details of which are given in ref. 10.

This setup provided 60 fs FWHM, 3 mJ light pulses centered at 800 nm. One part of the

beam was used to generate 800 nm probe pulses while the other part was used to generate
the  200  nm  (fourth  harmonic)  pump  pulses.  Up  to  20  µJ  of  the  200  nm  light  was

produced  this  way  (300-350  fs  FWHM  pulse).  The  pump  and  probe  beams  were
perpendicularly polarized and overlapped at the surface of a 150 µm thick high-speed jet

o

at 6.5

. Typically, 150-200 delay time points acquired on a quasi-logarithmic grid were

used to obtain the decay kinetics of the electron out to 600 ps. The vertical bars in the

figures represent 95% confidence limits for each data point. The details of the detection
and the flow system are given elsewhere. 10,11

5

Ultrafast QY measurements (200 nm photoexcitation). The pump power, before and after

the sample, was monitored using a thermopile power meter (Ophir Optronics model 2A-

SH). Normally, the concentration of the anion was such that the optical density of the

solution  across  the  jet  was  2-3;  the  transmission  of  the  pump  pulse  was  therefore

negligible. For obtaining the power dependence, a fast-response pyroelectric detector was

used (Molectron J3-080) whose output was amplified by 20 dB using a 3-stage preamp

(SRS model 240). This detector was calibrated at 1064 nm, and the readings for 200 nm

light were corrected by a factor of 1.43 given by the manufacturer. These readings where

7-10%  lower  than  the  readings  from  the  thermopile  detector  (both  of  these  NIST

traceable detectors had been recently calibrated by their respective manufacturers). Two

methods were used to characterize radial profiles of the focussed beams at the jet surface:
(i) transverse scanning of the beams by a 10 µm pinhole and (ii) imaging of the beams

using  a  CCD  camera  placed  in  the  equivalent  focal  plane.  The  typical  eccentricity  of

these focussed beams was 1-5%. A harmonic average of 1 e semiaxes obtained by a 2D

Gaussian  fit  is  given  below  as  the  beam  radius  (eq.  (A1)  in  the  Appendix;  see  the

Supplement). The probe beam was perfectly Gaussian (the typical profiles are shown in

Fig.  1(a)),  whereas  the  200  nm  pump  beam  was  of  inferior  quality,  exhibiting  one  or

several "hot" spots. For this reason, absolute QY measurements were performed with the

reverse beam geometry: the probe beam enveloped the pump beam and integrated over

the imperfections in the latter. For kinetic measurements, more common geometry was
used:  the  typical  radii  of  the  probe  and  pump  beams  where  65  µm  and  210  µm,

respectively, so that the pump beam enveloped the probe beam.

Absolute QY's for hydroxide and iodide were determined photometrically using

an approach explained in the Appendix (see the Supplement). A power dependence of the

photoinduced 800 nm absorbance from hydrated electron at delay time t=5 ps was plotted

vs. the pump power, and QY was calculated by least squares fits using eq. (A3). For the

data shown in Fig. 1(b), the beam radii of the pump and probe where 49±2 and 202±3
µm,  respectively.  The  absolute  QY  obtained  in  this  fashion  depends  on  the  assumed
molar absorptivity of the electron at 800 nm (the value of 18,530 M-1 cm-1 21,22 was used

throughout  this  series),  the  absolute  pump  power  (known  to  ±5%  accuracy  due  to  the

6

uncertainty in the calibration of the power meters), and the radii of the pump and probe

beams (known with accuracy < 3-5%). The thickness of the jet and the absorbance of

photoexcitation  light  by  the  solution  need  not  be  known  precisely  for  the  QY

determination.

These photometric measurements were complemented by actinometry. Electron

generation  in  200  nm  photoexcitation  of  K4Fe(CN)6  was  the  primary  actinometric

standard; a prompt QY of unity was assumed for this photoreaction (section 3.2). A 1.4
µm thick film of amorphous hydrogenated silicon on a Suprasil substrate (obtained from

H.  Fritzsche  of  the  University  of  Chicago)  was  used  as  the  secondary  standard.  This

sample was mounted on a 2D translation stage and positioned into the plane of the jet; the

pump  and  probe  beams  passed  through  the  same  spot  of  this  sample  for  each

measurement. For each anion solution, this reference sample was inserted into the beam

path immediately after the kinetic measurement. The 800 nm absorbance taken at the end
−  kinetics from these anion

of the excitation pulse was used for the normalization of  eaq

solutions. This 800 nm absorbance signal (ca. 0.134 OD per 1 µJ for a 59 µm 1/e radius

pump beam, see Fig. 1S in the supplement) was linear to the highest pump fluence used

for anion photoexcitation. The last step was to normalize these scaled electron kinetics so
4- was unity. For the series shown in Fig. 2, the
that the prompt electron yield for Fe(CN)6
pump power was 0.1-0.3 µJ, and Gaussian radii for the pump and probe beams were 43-
46 µm and 13-20 µm, respectively.

225  and  242  nm  photoexcitation.  Kinetic  experiments  with  225  nm  (242  nm)

photoexcitation were carried out at USC using either a 200 kHz or a 1 kHz Ti:sapphire
amplified laser system for which details are given elsewhere. 4,5,6 A 1 mm optical path

cell with CaF2 windows was used to flow the sample. Transient absorption signals down
to  10  µOD can be studied using this pump-probe spectrometer. Photoexcitation pulses

were generated by frequency doubling the pumped OPA output. The probe pulses were

selected from the white light supercontinuum generated in a sapphire disc using a 25 nm

FWHM  bandpass  interference  filter.  In  dilute  hydrosulfide  solutions  (<  0.01  M),  2-

photon water ionization by 242 nm light competed with one photon electron detachment
from HS- when 242 nm light irradiance was > 20 GW/cm2. To avoid this complication,

7

0.04-0.14  M  HS-  solutions  were  used  and  the  laser  irradiance  was  kept  <  5  GW/cm2.

Under these conditions, two photon ionization of water was negligible, and the transient
kinetics did not change with the HS- concentration and pump irradiance.

3. Results.

3.1. Photometric QY measurements for 200 nm photolysis of hydroxide and iodide.

Power dependencies for the yield of hydrated electron were obtained at delay time

t=5 ps following a 200 nm (300 fs FWHM) photoexcitation of 0.29 M KOH and 0.2 M

NaI solutions (Fig. 1(b)). At this delay time, the thermalization/solvation of the electron

is complete. No species other than the electron absorbed at the probe wavelength of 800

nm. The time profile of the thermalization and geminate decay kinetics did not change
with  the  200  nm  pump  power  (to  2.5  µJ).  The  negative  curvature  in  these  power

dependencies is the consequence of the beam geometry, as explained in the Appendix.

Quantum  yields  of  0.954±0.03  for  iodide  and  0.342±0.008  for  hydroxide  were

obtained by fitting these power dependencies using eq. (A3) (the error limits indicate the

standard error of these least squares fits). As explained in section 2, the actual confidence

limits are probably ±10% due to the uncertainty in the assumed parameters. Near unity

prompt  QY  for  electron  detachment  in  220-240  nm  photolysis  of  aqueous  iodide  was
(indirectly) determined by Bradforth and co-workers, 4 who extrapolated the free electron
yield data of Iwata et al. (for 248 nm photolysis) to  t → 0  using their ultrafast kinetic

data.

3.2. Actinometric QY measurements for various anions (200 nm photoexcitation).

The concentrations of the anions studied and their molar absorptivities at 200 nm

are given in Table 1 (the latter were taken from the literature sources given in Table 2 of
Part I of this series). 1 Time dependencies of quantum yield  φ t( ) for the electron in 200

nm photoexcitation of these aqueous anions were obtained as described in section 2 and

then fit between 3 ps and 600 ps by a sum of two exponentials with a nonzero offset (Fig.
2). The QYs were extrapolated to  t → ∞ and  t → 0  using these biexponential fits, and

8

the ratio of these quantities provided an estimate for the survival probability  Ω∞  of the

corresponding geminate pair (Table 1). For convenience, QYs at t=10 ps are also given.

Note that the ratio of these actinometric QYs for hydroxide and iodide is 0.36, which is

very  close  to  the  ratio  of  photometric  QYs  given  in section 3.1. For comparison, free

electron yields for 248 nm and 193 nm laser photoexcitation of the same anions are also

given in Table 1.

Fig. 2 suggests that aqueous hexacyanoferrate(II) anion (commonly referred to as

ferrocyanide) has the highest prompt QY of the aqueous anions studied in this work. The

geminate decay for ferrocyanide is very slow; there is almost no decay of the electron

absorbance over the first 600 ps. Bradforth and coworkers observed < 20% decrease in

the  hydrated  electron  absorbance  over  the  first  3  ns  after  220  nm  photoexcitation  of
ferrocyanide. 23 For higher photon energy, this geminate decay may be even slower, since

Sauer et al. obtained near unity QY for electron formation in 193 nm photolysis of 0.05-
0.7  mM  ferrocyanide.  1  A  limiting  quantum  yield  of  0.88  for  214  nm  photolysis  was

determined by Shirom and Stein for evolution of nitrogen formed by electron scavenging
in N2O-saturated solutions of ferrocyanide. 24  Between 254 nm and 214 nm wavelength,
this QY rapidly increased with the photon energy. The results of Sauer et al.  1 suggest

that  this  trend  continues  to  193  nm.  For  all  of  these  reasons,  the  prompt  QY  for

ferrocyanide was taken as unity. We emphasize that in millimolar solution, ferrocyanide
is associated with one or two potassium cations. 23,25 The first association constant is ca.
180  M-1, 25 i.e., 55% and 92% of the anions are associated in 2 and 20 mM solutions,

respectively. The associated anions may have slightly different photochemical properties
than bare anions (see Parts I  1  and II  11 of  this  series). Nevertheless, no difference was

observed in the recombination dynamics for 2 and 20 mM ferrocyanide solutions (see

Fig. 4(b) in section 4.1).

3.3. Protic equilibria and secondary chemistry.

Since hydrosulfide is a strong base, hydroxide is always present in its aqueous
solution. For aqueous H2S at 25oC, the first and the second ionization pKa’s are 7.05 and
19, respectively, 26 and the protic equilibria involving HS- do not play a significant role in

strongly at 800 nm and their formation rates for the anion concentrations given in Table 1

are too slow to interfere with our kinetic measurements.

Three more aqueous anions, in addition to those shown in Fig. 2, were studied

using 200 nm photoexcitation: chloride, perchlorate, and sulfate. Due to their weak 200

nm  absorbance,  5-10  M  solutions  of  these  anions  were  used.  These  results  have  been
discussed in Part II of this series 11 which deals with the ionic strength effect (see section

3S  and  Fig.  9S  therein).  For  these  photosystems,  one  is  forced  to  use  concentrated

solutions in which this effect is very prominent. Only for sulfate does the kinetics appear

to originate from photoexcitation of the nominal anion; for perchlorate and chloride the

absorbance signal is likely to be from a photoexcited impurity ion. For 0.74 M sulfate, the

kinetics  were  similar  to  those  for  sulfite  (at  the  same  ionic  strength);  the  estimated
electron yield at t=10 ps is ca. 0.41. 11 We also obtained the decay kinetics for electron in

0.5 M "carbonate" solution (Fig. 2S); however, due to the protic equilibrium most of the

electron absorbance is actually from photoexcited hydroxide (see the caption to Fig. 2S

for more details).

excitation data.

3.4.  Geminate  recombination:  a  comparison  between  the  high  and  low  energy

In this section, 200 nm pump – 800 nm probe kinetics are compared with these

kinetics  obtained  for  225  nm  or  242  nm  photoexcitation  (Figs.  3  and  4).  In  the  latter

series  the  probe  wavelength  was  700  nm  unless  specified  otherwise.  Due  to  the

differences in the probe wavelength and the width of the pump pulse, only kinetics at t >

10

5  ps  were  compared  (in  the  figures  given  below,  these  two  sets  of  kinetics  were

normalized at 5-10 ps; e.g., Fig. 3(a)).

Fig. 3(a) demonstrates these two normalized kinetics for bromide. This anion has
the first absorption maximum of CTTS band at 200 nm. 27,30,31 The 200 nm and 225 nm

excitation energies were studied systematically as a function of the total photon energy

using biphotonic excitation of iodide. For this anion, electron dynamics observed after
one- and two-photon excitation of the same total energy are nearly the same 6 (which is
not the case for OH-). 10   Given these previous results, only two iodide traces are given in

this study as a reference, to contrast the 200 nm and 225 nm kinetics for the iodide (Fig.

3(b)) with such kinetics for bromide (Fig. 3(a)). The 200 nm photoexcitation corresponds
to  the  second  (192  nm)  CTTS  subband  of  the  iodide.  6,27,30  The  200  nm  and  225  nm
kinetics for I- are very different: for the 200 nm photoexcitation, the survival probability

is greater and the fast exponential component is less prominent. As argued in ref. 6, this

transformation  is  consistent  with  broadening  of  the  initial  spatial  distribution  of

photogenerated electrons in the course of 200 nm photoexcitation.

Fig. 3(c), traces (i) and (ii), shows 242 nm and 200 nm kinetics for hydrosulfide,

respectively. For this anion, the maximum of the first CTTS band in water is at 228 nm;
32 200 nm is close to the position of its second CTTS band ("D" band identified by Fox
and Hayon 32 using a Gaussian decomposition of the UV spectra). Thus, energetically the

situation  is  very  similar  to  that  for  aqueous  iodide.  The  change  in  the  decay  kinetics

observed  at  the  higher  photoexcitation  energy  strikingly  resembles  that  observed  for

iodide in Fig. 3(b). Except for the faster exponential component (that fully decays in 20

ps),  the  242  nm  kinetics  for  hydrosulfide  look  much  like  those  observed  in  200  nm

photoexcitation  of  hydroxide  (Fig.  3(c),  trace  (iii))  and  bromide  (and  242-225  nm
photoexcitation of iodide), whereas the 200 nm kinetics for HS- look more like those for

11

200 nm photoexcitation of the iodide (compare Fig. 3(b), trace (ii) and Fig. 3(c), trace

(ii)).

For another pseudohalide, thiocyanate (CSN-), the 225 and 200 nm kinetics look
qualitatively different from those for iodide, bromide, HS-, and OH- (compare Fig. 3 and

4(a)). No fast component is discernible for either photoexcitation energy; the decay of the

electron is slow and the survival probability of the geminate pair is high. The latter value

is ca. 20% greater for 200 nm photoexcitation than for 225 nm photoexcitation. These

kinetics look more like those obtained for polyvalent anions, such as ferrocyanide (Fig.

4(b))  and  sulfite  (Fig.  4(c));  the  only  difference  is  the  relatively  low  prompt  quantum

efficiency for the electron photodetachment from the monovalent anion.

For sulfite (Fig. 4(c)), the 200 nm and 242 nm kinetics are very similar, except for

the higher escape probability for geminate pairs generated by the 200 nm photoexcitation

(the survival probability at 600 ns is ca. 10% higher for the higher photon energy).

For ferrocyanide (Fig. 4(b)),  the  200  nm  and  225  nm  kinetics  (t <  600  ps)  are

similar,  save  for  the  first  3  ps  (i.e.,  the  thermalization  phase);  the  latter  difference

originates through the difference in the probe wavelength used to observe the electron

dynamics (800 nm and 500 nm, respectively).

For  all  of  these  anions,  the  survival  probability  either  increases  with  the
photoexcitation  energy  or,  at  least,  stays  the  same.  A  systematic  increase  in  Ω∞   with

increasing photoexcitation energy has already been observed by Schwartz and coworkers
for  sodide  in  THF.  8  Bradforth  and  coworkers  observed  an  increase  in  the  survival

probability  with  the  total  excitation  energy  of  biphotonic  photoexcitation  of  aqueous
iodide.  6  Apparently,  this  trend  pertains  to  all  CTTS  anions  regardless  of  the  solvent

polarity  and/or  photoexcitation  mode.  The  increase  in  the  survival  probability  with

increasing photoexcitation energy partially (but not entirely) accounts for the increase in

For  polyvalent  anions  and  CNS-,  a  free  diffusion  model  complemented  with  a

prescribed initial distribution  P ri( ) of the electrons around their parent radicals provides a

good  recipe  for  simulating  geminate  pair  dynamics.  Hereafter,  we  assume  spherically

 for the geminate partners. In the free diffusion model, 13 the interaction

also provided good fits to these data. In these simulations, we assumed that d=0.5 nm and
D=4.5x10-5 cm2/s (which is the diffusion coefficient for hydrated electron in pure water).

Only t >5 ps kinetics were used to obtain the least squares fit. A typical fit for 200 nm

photoexcitation of sulfite is shown in Fig. 4(c). The following optimum parameters were
obtained:  bG=1.07±0.03  nm  ( ri =1.27  nm)  and  Ω∞ =0.545  (for  the  r 2-Gaussian

distribution) and bE=0.39±0.01 nm ( ri =1.3 nm) and  Ω∞ =0.53 ( for the r2-exponential

distribution). For 242 nm photoexcitation, bE=0.32±0.04 nm ( ri =1.1 nm) and  Ω∞ =0.47
(for the r2-exponential distribution); i.e., the escape probability is ca. 13% higher for the

(1)

200 nm photoexcitation. Note that this increase is clearly insufficient to account for a two

times increase in the free electron yield between 248 nm and 200 nm (Table 1) for sulfite.

Apparently, for this anion the prompt quantum yield of the electron increases with the

photon energy.

For  thiocyanate  anion  excited  by  200  nm  and  225  nm  photons,  we  obtained
bE=0.61±0.08 nm ( ri =1.92  nm)  and  Ω∞ =0.655  and bE=0.26±0.09 nm ( ri =0.98 nm)
and  Ω∞ =0.414,  respectively  (for  the  r2-exponential  distribution).  Thus,  the  escape

probability increases by 60% from 242 nm to 200 nm photoexcitation, whereas the free

electron  yield  increases  more  than  10  times  from  248  nm  to  200  nm  (Table  1).  Once

more, the dramatic increase in the free electron QY can only be due the increase in the

prompt electron yield rather than the survival probability of the geminate pair.

For ferrocyanide, geminate recombination is so slow and inefficient that only a

lower  estimate  for  ri

  can  be  obtained,  ca.  0.31  nm  (which  would  correspond  to

Ω∞ =0.66).  For  all  of  these  anions,  the  average  ejection  distances  ri

  are  over  1  nm,

which is the typical electron - hole separation in the low-energy excitation of neat water

(section 1). This suggests that the electron promoted from photoexcited polyvalent anions

is ejected directly into the conduction band of the solvent.

Hydrosulfide is a monovalent anion for which the geminate dynamics observed

following 200 nm photoexcitation may, on principle, be simulated using eq. (1) and an ad

hoc  electron  distribution  P ri( )  shown  in  Fig.  2S  in  the  supplement  (Note  that  for

monovalent anions other than thiocyanate, no distribution  P ri( ) can be found to account

for  the  kinetics  observed,  provided  that  the  diffusion  is  free).  This  distribution  was

determined  by  the  least  squares  optimization  of  probability  weights.  The  optimum
< 1 nm  (that includes 84% of the electrons

distribution consists of a narrow peak at  ri

with  ri

 of 0.63 nm) and a broad peak centered at 2.4 nm (which includes 16% of the

electrons with  ri

 of 3 nm). This simulation suggests that the electron distribution for

HS- photoexcited by 200 nm light might be at least as broad as that for CSN-. Note that
for HS- excited by 242 nm and 200 nm photons, the escape probability of the electron (as

estimated from biexponential fits) changes with the photon energy ca. 3 times, whereas

the free electron yield changes by an order of magnitude from 248 nm to 200 nm (Table

14

1).  This  anion  provides  yet  another  example  of  an  anion  photosystem  in  which  the

prompt QY of photoelectron dramatically increases with the photoexcitation energy.

4.2. Simulation of kinetic traces for monovalent  anions.

The  approach  used  to  simulate  kinetics  for  geminate  pairs  derived  from
monovalent  anions  is  based  on  Shushin's  semianalytical  theory  6,10,11,33  for  diffusion

controlled  reactions  in  a  potential  well.  In  this  model,  geminate  partners  interact  by

means of an attractive mean force potential (MFP), U r
( )
a  (at  which  u a( ) = −1).  It  can  be  shown  that  the  recombination  and  escape  from  the

can  be  evaluated  in  a  rather  complex  way  from  the  radial  profile  of  the  MFP  and  the
diffusion constant D. 10,33 The survival probability  Ω( )t  is given by 10

For halide anions, I- and Br-, the kinetics do not change with the photoexcitation

energy  across  the  low  energy  CTTS  subband,  and  we  assume  that  the  electron

distribution does not change with this energy. (It may also be assumed that in this energy
regime  υ>> 1, and the geminate kinetics are not sensitive to the changes in the electron

aqueous iodide excited by photons with total energy > 6 eV, the kinetics can still be fit

using the same MFP parameters assuming that the electron distribution exhibits a broad,

energy CTTS photoexcitation. The broad and the narrow components correspond to the

direct  ionization  and  CTTS  state  mediated  electron  detachment,  respectively.  A

nm data for the iodide, such a bimodal distribution is not needed: it is possible to fit the
≈0.57 nm which corresponds

kinetic data using the  r 2 -exponential distribution with  ri

to  υ≈2.2. The choice between the bimodal and monomodal distribution is difficult to

make  since  the  shape  of  this  prescribed  monomodal  distribution  is  arbitrary.  The

advantage of using the bimodal distribution is that the two postulated components have

clear physical meaning. The disadvantage is that extra assumptions have to be made to

reduce the parameter space (e.g., in ref. 6 we assumed that the broad distribution has the

same  width  at  different  energies,  which  is  not  self-evident,  etc.)  Such  a  dilemma  is

always  present  in  the  analysis  of  recombination  kinetics  due  to  the  relatively  weak
dependence of  Ω t( ) on the fine details of the  P ri

( ) profile.

The  broad  initial  electron  distribution  is  also  needed  to  account  for  the  HS-
kinetics given in Fig. 5(b). Following the approach used for iodide 4,6 and hydroxide, 10
we assumed that the lowest-energy (242 nm) kinetics correspond to the case when υ>> 1
and then optimized parameter  υ; this procedure gave  υ≈3 for 225 nm photoexcitation
and  υ≈2.1 for 200 nm photoexcitation. Note that for hydrosulfide the life time of caged
pairs (parameter  W −1) is 3-5 times shorter than that for OH- and halide anions (Table 2);

the Onsager radius is also smaller (ca. 0.32 nm). The probability of escape,  pd ,  at  the

onset of the CTTS band, increases in the order  Br

4.3. Synopsis.

The  following  general  pattern  emerges  from  our  results:  Most  photoexcited

aqueous anions yield a broad initial distribution of electron-radical separations, at least

under some excitation conditions. Photoexcitation of polyvalent anions as well as some
pseudohalide  anions,  such  as  CNS-,  always  yields  this  type  of  electron  distribution,

regardless of the photon energy. For halide anions, the electron distribution changes from
a narrow one to a broad one when the photon energy exceeds a certain threshold value. 4,6

The  QY  data  suggest  a  systematic  broadening  of  the  electron  distribution  with  the
2-, CSN-, HS-, and I-) that accounts for the increase in the

excitation energy (e.g., for SO3

survival probability and the free electron yield. For iodide in water and sodide in THF,
this increase has already been reported.  6,8 The prompt QY for aqueous halides is near

unity regardless of the photoexcitation energy, but this is not the case for other aqueous

anions.  For  thiocyanate,  sulfite,  and  hydrosulfide  the  increase  in  the  free  electron  QY

17

with  increasing  photon  energy  is  much  greater  than  the  concomitant  increase  in  the

escape probability of the electron: for these anions, the prompt QY definitely increases

with  the  photoexcitation  energy.  For  200  nm  photoexcitation,  prompt  QYs  for

pseudohalides are 30-40% of the QYs for halides; the prompt QYs for polyvalent anions

do not follow any obvious pattern. Some trends in these QYs and possible explanations
for these trends were discussed in Part I of this series. 1

The  current  thinking  is  that  the  broad  electron  distribution  originates  mainly

through  the  direct  photoionization  when  the  electron  is  promoted  into  the  conduction
band of water. For some anions (e.g., ferrocyanide), 34 the ejection distances are so long

that no other mechanisms seem possible. The broadening of the electron distribution with

increasing  excitation  energy  may  be  viewed  as  a  competition  between  this  direct

ionization  (which  involves  extended  state  electrons)  and  dissociation  of  the  precursor

CTTS state that involves localized electrons only, as explained in the Introduction. The

latter  photoprocess  prevails  at  low  excitation  energies  since  the  conduction  band  is

inaccessible at these low energies.

Our results do not wholly agree with this picture: for some of these anions (both

mono-  and  poly-  valent)  the  broadening  of  the  electron  distribution  with  increasing

excitation energy occurs across their entire lower CTTS band. For polyvalent anions (and

even some monovalent anions, such as thiocyanate), it is not clear from our kinetic data

that  the  CTTS  state  dissociation  analogous  to  that  observed  for  halides  occurs  at  all.

Energetics  alone  do  not  account  for  the  remarkable  differences  observed  between  the
picosecond dynamics of the corresponding geminate pairs. For example, HS-,  I-, CSN-,
2-  all  have  similar  CTTS  band  energies  and  photoelectron  emission  threshold

and  SO3

energies  (see  Table  1  in  ref.  35),  yet  the  latter  two  anions  yield  broad  electron

distributions regardless of the photoexcitation energy whereas iodide and hydrosulfide

yield  a  narrow  electron  distribution  when  excited  by  low  energy  photons  and  a  broad

electron distribution when excited by high energy photons.

18

5. Conclusion.

Time-dependent  photoelectron  quantum  yields  generated  by  200  nm

photoexcitation  of  several  aqueous  anions  have  been  obtained.  These  kinetic  profiles

were compared with the 225 nm (and/or 242 nm) kinetic data for the same anions. It is

shown that electron photodetachment from molecular anions follows a different set of

rules than electron photodetachment from halide anions. In particular, the distribution of
electrons  promoted  from  non-halide  anions  (including  HS-,  CNS-  and  all  polyvalent

anions)  shows  a  broad  component  from  the  very  onset  of  the  lower  CTTS  band.  For

halide anions there is a well-defined threshold energy below which only narrow electron

distributions  are  obtained.  It  is  not  presently  clear  what  specific  mechanisms  are

responsible for the observed electron distributions.

Previously,  we  speculated  that  near  unity  prompt  quantum  yield  for  electron

promoted  from  the  aqueous  CTTS  anions  might  be  the  general  feature  of  electron
photodetachment from such anions. 4 This study shows that pseudohalide anions such as
HO- and HS- (for which there are no known side photoreactions or discernible bound-to-

bound absorbances) exhibit substantially lower prompt QYs for electron detachment than

the  halides  (Table  1).  Another  peculiarity  of  electron  photodetachment  from  small

polyatomic anions is that the prompt QY across the lower CTTS band is not constant, as

is apparently the case for halide anions.

From the outset of photochemical studies of CTTS anions, it has been believed

that  studies  of  electron  photodetachment  from  aqueous  halides,  such  as  iodide,  would

provide critical insight into the analogous photoreactions for more complex polyatomic

anions. This work suggests that even the simplest polyatomic anions behave somewhat

differently from these halides. More experimental and theoretical studies are therefore

needed before any generalization is possible. In particular, theoretical modeling of CTTS

state dissociation for polyatomic, especially polyvalent, anions would be beneficial .since

presently such models exist for halide anions only. As the latter anions appear to be in a

class of their own, these models do not shed much light onto the general case.

Appendix: Equations for the absolute QY measurement.

To estimate the  QY, the  following approach  was  used: The  (axially symmetrical)
radial profiles for the  pump  and probe  beams were assumed to  be Gaussian, so  that  the

depth of the excitation light. Neglecting the absorbance of 200 nm light by  photogenerated
species and assuming that the  optical density  of a sample of thickness L is much greater

is  given  by  I pump .  The  average  concentration  P r( )  of  the  photoproduct(s)  across  the

which is correct when the second term in the square brackets is much less than unity. For
χ>> 1 (the pump beam enveloping the probe beam), this term should be omitted. If the
correction term is not small, integration of eq. (A3) must be carried out numerically.

(a) The typical transient absorbance signal from a 1.4 µm thick film of undoped  a-Si:H (8
at. % H) on 1 mm silica substrate (open circles). This absorbance was detected at 800 nm,
where both free conduction band electrons (short-lived signal) and trapped  charges in the
band tails (long-lived signal) absorb the probe light. This  sample was  obtained from Prof.
H. Fritzsche and Dr. P. Stradins of the James Frank Institute, University  of Chicago. The
details of the sample preparation are given by  Shkrob, I. A.; Crowell, R. A.  Phys. Rev. B
1998,  57,  12207.  The  solid  line  is  a  convolution  of  a  Gaussian  profile  of  the  200  nm
pump  pulse  (380 fs  FWHM)  and the  biexponential decay kinetics. The  maximum  ∆OD
signal is plotted  vs.  the  incident  power  of  200  nm  beam  (1 e  radius  of  59  µm)  in  (b)
(empty circles). In this plot, 300 nJ corresponds to the photon fluence of 2.7 mJ/cm2. The
slope of the linear dependence (solid line) is 0.134 per mJ. This thin film sample was used
as  a  convenient  actinometric  standard,  as  explained  in  section  2.  The  200  nm  kinetics
shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4 were obtained using 200 nm laser pulses of 100-300 nJ.

Time-dependent quantum yield φ t( ) of photoelectrons for  200 nm photoexcitation of 0.5
M carbonate solution (open circles). The  vertical bars are 95% confidence limits; the  line
drawn through the  points  is a biexponential fit.  The  extrapolated  QYs  at  zero  time  and
infinity are 0.724 and 0.262, respectively (19% escape fraction). The free-electron QY for
2- at  193 nm is 0.453.  1 For  carbonic acid, the  pKa’s  are  6.35  and  10.33,  26  and  the

carbonate solution contains 10 mM of OH- and HCO3

molar absorptivity  of CO3
which  is  ca.  150  M -1  cm-1.  1  At  193  nm,  the  molar  absorptivities  of  bicarbonate  and
carbonate anions are similar; if this similarity also holds for longer wavelengths, the  molar
absorptivity  of the  carbonate is ca. 30 M -1  cm-1.  27 This  value is much lower than  1000
M-1 cm-1 for hydroxide (Table 1). Using these  estimates,  simple calculation suggests that
the  200  nm  light  is  absorbed  in  a  3:2  ratio  by  the  carbonate  and  hydroxide  anions,

should be increased from 0.72 to  ca. 0.95. Note  that  despite  this  large prompt  QY,  free
2-  and  OH-  are  comparable,  i.e.,  the  survival  probability  of  the

carbonate (to  reduce  this  complicating  effect)  was  impractical  since  in  dilute  carbonate

solutions an even lower fraction of 200 nm light would be absorbed by  CO3
the pH of the solution was also impractical since the buffer salts (such as phosphates  and
borates) would absorb the photoexcitation light.

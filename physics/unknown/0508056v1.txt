Abstract:  this  paper  addresses  the  issue  of  the  relation  between  the  system  efficiency  and  the  individual 
performance  with  different  combinations  of  agent  memory  lengths  in  mix-game  model  which  is  an 
extension of minority game (MG). In mix-game, there are two groups of agents; group1 plays the majority 
game, but the group2 plays the minority game. The average winnings of agents can represent the average 
individual performance and the volatility of a system can represent the efficiency of the system. It is found 
the correlations between the average winnings of agents and the medians of local volatilities are different 
when  agent  memory  lengths  change  with  different  combinations  of  m1=m2,  m1<m2=6  and  m2<m1=6. 
This paper also gives some suggestions for designing complex competing systems.

1.  Introduction   

 

A  designer  or  a  manager  who  design  or  manage  competing  systems  which  consist  of 

heterogeneous agents who compete constantly for limited resources, such as different species 

in  an  ecological  system,  traders  in  financial  markets,  drivers  on  city  roads  and  highways  or 

users accessing a computer network – faces problems of coordination since selfish agents in 

such systems all want to optimize their performances and individual goals will most certainly 

be conflicting. If he or she hopes to balance the individual performance and the efficiency of 

the system, he or she needs to know the relationship between the individual performance and 

the efficiency of the system. However, the interplay between the state of optimal individual 

performance and the reach of a globally efficient phase where the collective use of resources 

is  optimal  may  be  quite  subtle  [1,  2].  Therefore,  the study  of  this  issue  has  both  theoretical 

and practical importance, which can reveal how the macroscopic properties of a system may 

emerge  from  the  microscopic  interaction  of  agents  and  under  which  conditions,  and  this 

understanding may help for designing or managing of complex systems.   

Agent-based  models  can  be  used  to  address  directly  the  relation  between  microscopic 

behavior  of  agents  and  macroscopic  properties  of  a  system  (like  fluctuations,  predictability 

and  efficiency)  [1,  2].  In  article  [2],  I  studied  the  correlations  of  the  average  winnings  of 

agents  and  the  volatilities  of  systems  based  on  mix-game  model  [3,  4,  5]  which  is  an 

extension of minority game (MG) [6, 7, 8]. In mix-game, there are two groups of agents; the 

group1  plays  the  majority  game  [9,  10,  11,  12,  13,  14  15,  16],  but  the  group2  plays  the 

minority game. The results show that the correlations between the average winnings of agents 

and the mean of local volatilities are different with different combinations of agents’ memory 

lengths  when  the  proportion  of  agents  in  group1  increases. The  average  winnings  of  agents 

can represent the average individual performance and the volatility of a system can represent 

the efficiency of the system. Therefore, these results imply that the combinations of agents’ 

memory lengths largely influence the relation between the system efficiency and the average 

individual performance.     

In  this  paper,  I  further  address  this  issue  by  examining  how  the  combinations  of  agents’ 

memory  lengths  influence  the  relation  between  the  system  efficiency  and  the  average 

individual  performance.  This  paper  is  organized  as  following.  Section  2  describes  the 

mix-game model and the simulation conditions. Section 3 presents the simulation results and 

the  results  of  the  quantitative  correlations.  Section  4  discusses  the  results.  In  section  5,  the 

conclusion is reached. 

2.  The model and simulation conditions 

Mix-game model is an extension of minority game (MG) so its structure is similar to MG. 

In  mix-game,  there  are  two  groups  of  agents;  the  group1  plays  the  majority  game,  and  the 

group2 plays the minority game. N (odd number) is the total number of the agents and N1 is 

number of agents in group1. The system resource is r=N*L, where L<1 is the proportion of 

resource of the system. All agents compete in the system for the limited resource r. T1 and T2 

are the time horizon lengths of the two groups of agents, and m1 and m2 denote the memory 

lengths of the two groups of agents, respectively.     

The global information only available to the agents is a common bit-string “memory” of the 

m1 or m2 most recent competition outcomes (1 or 0). A strategy consists of a response, i.e., 0 

(sell) or 1 (buy), to each possible bit string; hence there are 

m

122

or 

m

222

  possible strategies 

for group 1 or group 2, respectively, which form full strategy spaces (FSS). At the beginning 

of the game, each agent is assigned s strategies and keeps them unchangeable during the game. 

After each turn, agents assign one (virtual) point to a strategy which would have predicted the 

correct outcome. For agents in group 1, they will reward their strategies one point if they are 

in the majority; for agents in group 2, they will reward their strategies one point if they are in 

the minority. Agents collect the virtual points for their strategies over the time horizon T1 or 

T2, and they use their strategy which has the highest virtual point in each turn. If there are two 

strategies which have the highest virtual point, agents use coin toss to decide which strategy 

to be used. Excess demand is equal to the number of ones (buy) which agents choose minus 

the number of zeros (sell) which agents choose. According to a widely accepted assumption 

that  excess  demand  exerts  a  force  on  the  price  of  the  asset  and  the  change  of  price  is 

proportion to the excess demand in a financial market [17, 18, 19], the time series of price of 

the asset can be calculated based on the time series of excess demand.   

In simulation, the distribution of initial strategies of agents is randomly distributed in the 

full  strategy  space  and  keeps  unchanged  during  the  game.  Simulation  turns  are  3000.  Total 

number of agents is 201. Number of strategies per agent is 2.

Fig.1  medians  of  local  volatilities  vs.  different  memory  length  of  group1  or  group  2  (m1  or  m2),  Vol.1 

representing medians of local volatilities of m2=6, T1=T2=12, N=201, N1=72, s=2 and m1 varying from 1 

to  6;  Vol.2  representing  medians  of  local  volatilities  of  m1=6,  T1=T2=12,  N=201,  N1=72,  s=2  and  m2 

varying from 1 to 6; Vol.3 representing medians of local volatilities of m1=m2, T1=T2=12, N=201, N1=72, 

s=2.   

Volatility  of  the  time  series  of  prices  is  represented  by  the  variance  of  the  increases  of 

prices. The local volatilities are calculated at every timestep by calculating the variance of the 

increases of prices within a small timestep window. The window length of local volatility is 5 

in  Fig.1.  From  Fig.1,  one  can  find  that  the  medians  of  local  volatilities  (Vol.1  and  Vol.2) 

increase  while  the  memory  length  m1  or  m2  decreases  from  6  to  1  in  both  simulation 

situations. But the difference is that Vol.2 is much larger than Vol.1 when m1 or m2 is smaller 

than  5.  This  means  that  agents  with  larger  memory  length  playing  majority  game  make  the 

systems less efficient. Vol.3 represents the medians of local volatilities when m1 is equal to 

m2 and they increase from 1 to 6 and it is similar to Vol.1.

From  Fig.  2,  one  can  find  that  the  average  winnings  (R1  and  R2)  of  these  two  groups 

increase when m1 decreases from 6 to 1 and R1 increases much more quickly than R2. The 

average  winning  of  group1  (R1)  is  larger  than  that  of  group2  (R2).  Comparing  Fig.1  with 

Fig.2, one can find that the median of local volatilities (Vol.1) increases when m1 decreases 

from  6  to  1  under  the  condition  of  m2=6,  T1=T2=12,  N=201,  N1=72,  s=2,  accompanying 

with the increase of the average winnings of group1 and group2 (R1, R2). Table 1 shows that 

correlations  are  among  R1,  R2  and  Vol.1  are  largely  positive.  These  results  mean  that  the 

improvement  of  the  performance  of  individual  agents  accompanies  with  the  decrease  of  the 

efficiency  of  systems  under  this  simulation  condition.  Agents  can  benefit  from  the  larger 

fluctuation  of  systems,  especially  for  agents in  group1. This is  accordant  with the reality of 

financial markets.

From Fig. 3, one can find that the average winning of group2 (R2) decreases when m2 

decreases from 6 to 1 while the average winning of group1 (R1) does not change greatly. The 

average  winning  of  group1  (R1)  is  much  larger  than  that  of  group2  (R2)  and  the  agents  in 

group1  don’t  influence  the  average  real  winnings  of  agents  in  group2  in  this  simulation 

condition [5].   

Comparing  Fig.3  with  Fig.1,  one  can  notice  that  the  median  of  local  volatilities  (Vol.2) 

increases when m2 decreases from 6 to 1 under the condition of m1=6, T1=T2=12, N=201, 

N1=72,  s=2,  accompanying  with  the  decrease  of  the  average  winning  of  group2  (R2)  and 

nearly  stable  average  winning  of  group1  (R1).  Table  2  shows  that  the  average  winning  of 

group2  (R2)  strongly  negatively  correlated  with  the  volatilities  of  systems  (Vol.2),  but  the 

average  winning  of  group1  (R1)  just  slightly  positively  correlated  with  the  volatilities  of 

systems (Vol.2).

From  Fig.4  one  can  find  that  the  average  winnings  of  group1  and  group2  (R1  and  R2) 

have  the  lowest  points  at  m1=m2=2  and  the  highest  points  at  m1=m2=4.  Comparing  Fig.4 

with Fig.1, one can observe that the relations among that the average winnings of group1 and 

group2 (R1 and R2) and the volatilities of systems (Vol.3) are much more complicated than 

that in the previous two simulation situations. Comparing R1 and R2 with Vol.3 at m1=m2=1 

and  m1=m2=6,  we  can  notice  that  agents  with  larger  memory  length  get  higher  winning 

scores but the Vol.3 remains nearly the same. However, at m1=m2=3, Vol.3 has the highest 

value,  but  R1  at  this  point  is  just  a  little  larger  than  that  at  m1=m2=1  and  R2  is  almost  the 

same at these two points. It is interesting that  R1  and R2 increase greatly at m1=m2=4 and 

Vol.3  decreases  obviously  at  the  same  point.  Table  3  shows  that  the  average  winnings  of 

group1 and group2 (R1 and R2) greatly negatively correlated with the volatilities of systems 

(Vol.3).       

4.  Concluding remarks 

The correlations between the average winnings of agents (R1 and R2) and the medians of 

local  volatilities  are  different  when  agents’  memory  lengths  change  with  different 

combination of m1=m2, m1<m2=6 and m2<m1=6.     

If a designer or a manager of a complex system hope to reach an optimal state at which 

the system has high efficiency and agents have high individual performances, he or she can 

choose  m1=m2=4,  5  and  6  as  agents’  memory  lengths,  and  avoid  the  memory  length 

combinations of m1=6>m2. If he or she intend to improve the agents’ performance at the cost 

of moderately losing system efficiency, he or she can m1<m2=6 as agents’ memory lengths. 

This study result also suggests that m1 be smaller than m2 if researchers want to mix-game 

model to simulate the financial markets.

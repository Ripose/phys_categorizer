Abstract: A novel approach is used to enhance by nearly two orders of magnitude the conversion 
efficiency of a 125 nm-coherent source, based on four-wave mixing in room-temperature mercury 
vapor. Saturation issues are observed and discussed.  
 

 
1. Introduction 
The need for compact, reliable and robust sources in the VUV region (100<λ<200 nm) is increasingly strong, due to 
its numerous emerging applications: we may mention nanopatterning and nanolithography, photochemical ablation 
of polymers [1], biochemistry, and more recently (exo-)biology and radioprotection. All these applications benefit 
from an efficient (and athermal) one-photon interaction of light with matter. In most cases, synchrotron radiation is 
used,  and  in  some  cases  excimer  lasers,  but  the  latter  suffer  from  weak  coherence,  fixed  wavelength  and 
troublesome  maintenance.  Nonlinear  conversion  of  visible  and  IR  lasers  in  vapors  (crystals  are  not  transparent 
enough in this domain) has been extensively studied since the 70’s; in this context mercury vapor has emerged as 
one of the most efficient nonlinear media for the production of 120-185 nm radiation (recently a Hg-based source 
has  been  used  to  produce  Lyman-α  CW  radiation  for  cooling  antihydrogen  atoms  [2]).  However,  these  sources 
involve up to three different spectrally narrow lasers, and mercury is heated at ~200 °C to make the atomic density 
large enough to ensure reasonable efficiency. Since deposition of opaque Hg on windows is an issue, very complex 
cell geometries have been proposed. The presence of hot mercury severely restricts the practical or industrial use of 
these  sources,  for  both  technical  and  ecological  reasons.  We  presented  in  a  previous  paper  a  double  resonance 
strategy to produce coherent 125-nm light with a single dye laser at 625.7 nm using a room-temperature Hg cell [3].  
We  present  in  this  paper  a  way  to  enhance  the  conversion  efficiency  without  heating  the  mercury,  by  locally 
increasing  the  atomic  density  (both  spatially  and  temporally)  thanks  to  an  external  laser  focussed  on  the  mercury 
pool (?) to provoke controlled vaporization.  
 
2.Experimental setup 
The  VUV  radiation  at  125.14  nm  is  obtained  by  a  four-wave  mixing  process  shown  schematically  in  fig.  1.  The 
frequency  ω1of  the  dye  laser  (DCM+Rhodamine  640)  is  adjusted  in  order  that  its  frequency-doubled  output  at 
ω2=2ω1 is resonant with the 61S0→71S0 two-photon transition of Hg.  The colinear beams at ω1 and ω2 (2.6 mJ and 
0.7 mJ incident onto the Hg cell, respectively) are tightly focussed to a ~40µm spot (in diameter) with a 280-mm 
focal length achromatic doublet. To demonstrate the principle of an enhancement, we chose as a vaporization source 
an  ArF  excimer  laser  (Neweks  PSX-100,  3  mJ  @193  nm,  4  ns  pulse  duration)  because  of  the  strong  absorption 
coefficient of liquid Hg at this wavelength at normal incidence (70 %). The ArF beam was focussed onto the Hg 
surface with a 50-mm quartz lens. The VUV signal is measured by a calibrated CsI solar-blind photomultiplier. The 
intensities of red and UV beam were adjustable separately (see fig. 1.) 
 
3.Results and discussion 
As shown in fig.2a, the largest enhancement factor is obtained when the vaporization laser hits the surface ~1.5 µs 
before the UV and red beams. When the lossy elements (waveplates and polarizers) were removed, we obtained a 
maximum  VUV  energy  of  2.5  µJ  (300 W  peak  power  inside  the  cell)  corresponding  to  ~1MW/cm2  and  an 
enhancement  factor  of  6.  But  interestingly,  this  enhancement  increases  dramatically  when  both  the  UV  and  the 
visible intensities are decreased, as shown in figure 2b for the UV beam and attains here values >60 for very low UV 
fluences (for lower UV energies the VUV output without vaporization was too small to be  measurable).

This strong saturation proves that the vaporization does not only increase the Hg atomic density : the VUV yield is 
affected by a modification of phase matching conditions due to a significant saturation of the two-photon transition, 
as  well  as  by  the  competition  with  other  nonlinear  effects  (parametric  oscillation,  ASE…),  as  can  be  shown  by  a 
XUV spectrum analysis. This means that the tight focussing regime is not optimal any more when the vaporizing 
laser in present.

beams; fig. 2b (right): VUV yield (left) and enhancement factor (right) vs. UV energy at constant energy at ω1 (2,6 mJ). The ArF energy 
is 3 mJ and the temporal shift (see fig. 2a) is fixed to 1.5 µs. 

These first results show that an efficient source based on a room-temperature Hg cell is feasible using lower fluences 
i.e. larger beams. Provided that the lasers are replaced by state-of-the-art solid-state sources, these results are highly 
encouraging for the realization of a tabletop (surface < 2 m2) VUV laser.

Abstract

The focusing of high energy charged particles by a bent  crystal  is  considered.  The
limits  and  constraints  of  focusing  imposed  by  dynamics  of  particles  are  pointed
out.  The crystalline geometry provided the maximum magnification and minimum
focusing size is proposed. The focusing parameters are compared with current ex-
perimental results.

1  Introduction

The  possibility  of beam  steering  of high  energy  particles  by  a crystal  has  been
investigated  since  Tsyganov  first  proposed  bent  crystal  channelingfl].  After
the  successful  demonstration  of the  bent  channeling[2],  it  became  clear  that
bent  crystals can be used for constructing a focusing element  with extremely
short  focal  length and focal spot close to size of one atomic channel.  Several
crystal  devices  for focusing were suggested [3-6].  Their  common  idea is  based
on differently bent plane channels to provide a 1-D beam convergence to a fo-
cal point. Because the crystal planes are naturally parallel, the focusing device
must  exert  an  external  force  making  channels  converged.  Simple  solution  is
a monocrystal  partially  cut  into thin  parallel  slices  with  empty  gaps  between
them[3]. To focus the beam the slices should be pressed together. Another so-
lution is to apply a strong external pressure providing channel's convergence
of the bulk crystal[5].  The further development  in this direction led to mixed
crystals  with  smooth  change  in  the  lattice  constant [6].  Similar  constructions
with graded composition layers were suggested and tested [7] for a deflection of
particles. There is no need for the external force in such devices and they look
very promising if considerable  large  and  defects  free quality crystal  could  be
attained by molecular beam epitaxy  (MBE)  technique.  A very simple method

to  bend  the  channels  was  recently  proposed  by  a  Russian-Italian  collabora-
tion[8].  In this method, small scratch on the side surface of the crystal causes
a  local  deformation  of  the  crystallographic  planes  down  to  a  few  hundred
microns.  The gradient  of deformation creates the different  curvature of adja-
cent channels.  This can explain a peculiar focusing effect observed in series of
experiment at Serpukhov and described in the reference[9], pp.118-122.

A different  approach from mentioned above is the use a regular bent crystal
with  constant  curvature  and  parallel  channels,  but  the  end  face  of  the  crys-
tal  must  be  shaped  in  such  a way  that  the  tangent  lines  to  the  channels  on
that face are converged to a single point, see Fig.  l(a).  In this case the center
points  of  the  channels  on  the  end  face  of the  crystal  constitute  a  cylindri-
cal  surface.  The  diameter,  D,  of this  surface  is  greater  than  curvature  radii,
Rmin <  R <  Rmaxi  of all channels.  Up until now only this focusing geometry
was successfully tested[10,ll], and the focusing spot of 43^m was attained at
the distance of 0.5m.

This  paper  examines  the  physical  limits  on  focusing with  a similar geometry
and proposes  a way to improve the focusing parameters.  We restrict our con-
sideration  by  one  crystal  with  given  aperture  uniformly filled by  a  particle
beam. The thorough statistical analysis of focusing in 1-D and 2-D geometries
and  multiple  crystals will be considered elsewhere.

2  Focusing parameters  and  their  limits

When  an  partical  beam  is  exactly  aligned  with  a  set  of planes,  the  particles
are  captured  into  channeling  trajectories  and  directed  along  the  bent  atomic
channels (Fig.  l(a)). At the exit of the crystal, each channel produces a parti-
cle microbeam (or more precisely subnanobeam because its size is ~ 0.2nm for

(1)

(2)

(4)

(110)  Si) which is directed along the tangent line.  Each microbeam is incoher-
ent to adjacent microbeams due to well known[12] equilibrium tendency inside
the  channels.  The  microbeam  will  travel  a  distance  F,  Fmin  <  F  <  Fmax,  to
the  focal  point.  The  radius-vector  jR  from  the  center  of curvature  O  to  the
output  point  of  each  channel  is  perpendicular  to  the  center  beam  line  and
satisfy the equation

D2 = R2 + F2, 

where  diameter  of the  cylindrical  surface,  D,  is  a constant  for  all  channels,
but  the  radius  R  and  focal  length  F  are  slightly  different.  The first and  last
microbeams  in the  crystal cross  section  are described by the equations

and the relation between the angle of focusing pencil 7 and the cut  angle (3 is

tan/3 = 7*^^, 

where dc =  Rmax — Rmin is the thickness of the crystal. Three Si crystals with
size 70 * 15 * 2mm were used in the experiment[10,11], and table 1 shows the
angles  /?, 7 and focal length  F for the experimental set up.

If 7 =  Lf/Rmax  <C  1  and Fmax/ Rmax ^ 7 then the cylindrical surface in Fig.  1
could  be  made  by  cutting the  whole  crystal  at  the  angle  /3  =  arctan(L//dc)
and  bending  the  cutting surface  over  the  cylinder  with  diameter  D.  Table  1
shows also the effective crystal length, L/, participated in the focusing process.

The microbeam from each bent channel has a divergence * = (1 —
(see, e.g. [13]), where fyp is the Lindhard critical angle for planar channeling, Rc
is the Tsyganov  radius (*p  =  25/^rad,  Rc  =  0.26m  in  ref.[10,ll]).  Obviously,
the focal spot  is proportional to the focal distance  Fmax.  Fig.  l(a)  shows that
a  crystal  with  parameters  that  satisfies  Eq.  (1)  can  only  slide  around  the
cylindrical surface.  The smaller the distance FTOax, the smaller the focal spot.

The  case  with  the  minimum  possible  focal  distance  is  shown  in  Fig  2(a)),
where  the  focal  spot  lies  almost  on  the  tip  of the  crystal  and  Fmin  =  0.  This
geometry  may give  the  smallest  focal  spot  with maximum  intensity,  and  it  is
interesting  to  consider  it  in  more  detail.

Eq.  (3)  with condition Fmin = 0 leads to D =  Umax,
maximum  focal  length  must  obey  the  equation

We  may  introduce  the  average  focal  distance  F  =  (Fmax  + Fmin)/2.  For  the
crystal in Fig. 2(a), F = Fmax/2 and is proportional to the square root of the
thickness  dc

For the crystal bend radius R = 2.7m[10,ll], the  formula  (8) gives F =  52mm.
This is a theoretical limit of possible focal lengths for given uniform bend and
thickness of the crystal.  The estimations of the full focal size and peak intensity
can  also easily  be  derived  using  Eq.  (8):

where  /Q  is  the  initial  intensity,  Fc°  is  the  probability  of particle  capture  in
channeling mode by straight crystal,  and  (1 — RC/R)  is the bent  crystal fac-
tor  [13].  It  is important  to note that the focal spot  of the ideal crystalline lens
and  the  focal  peak  intensity  are  proportional  to  the  square  root  of the  crys-
tal thickness.  The peak intensity is inversely proportional to the square root
of the curvature radius.  This does presume the crystal aperture is uniformly
filled  by  the  beam.  It  should  be  noted  that  Eqs.  (9,10)  are  only  estimations,
accurate calculations will give the factor  f ( R) ~  (1 — RC/R)  in Eq.  (10), thus
the  intensity  reaches  a maximum  at  optimal  radius  R  =  3RC.  If a  crystal  is
cut  according  to  the  geometry  drawn  in  Fig.  2(a)  and  with  the  experimen-
tal conditions of ref.[10,ll],  using Eq.  (9,  10)  one can estimate the  best  focal
spot  A/  ~  3.0/xm,  and  magnification  If/(I0P%)  ~  600.  It  is  10  times  better
than was obtained in experiment  [10,11]. The cutting angle (3 in geometry of
Fig.  2(a)  must  be  SS.Qdegree.  However,  there  are  some  obstacles  to  get  ex-
treme focal parameters because several defocusing factors may come into play.
At small angles (?r/2 — jS) the smoothness of the cylindrical surface is of great
importance, the amorphous layer on that surface must be as thin as possible,
and all adjacent channels must constitute the staircase with step widths equals
to the interplaner space. Any deviation caused by surface roughness or mosaic
blocks  with  widths  about  the  length  of channeling  oscillation  will  produce  a
broadening of the focal spot and decrease the peak intensity.  This could cause
an  abberation  seen  in  [10,11]  at  focal  length  of 0.5m.  There  are  techniques
such  as  surface  etching  and  argon  polishing  that  can  reduce  the  surface  ef-
fects.  Other  sources  of abberation  to  be  considered  for  focusing  are  negative
Gaussian curvature of bent crystals (anticlastic effect) and asymmetry of cen-
tripetal  dechanneling  in  bent  channels  [9,13].  If the  first  can  be  avoided  by
special shape of the crystal, the last one is inevitable.  There is also a possibil-
ity  of asymmetry  in  coherent  transitional  scattering  when  the  particles  come
out with small angles (?r/2 — (3). For long crystal dechanneling is essential. In
this  case  the  thickness  of the  crystal  dc  should  be  substituted  by  Lr>/tan(/3),
where LD  is the the dechanneling length. As a result the modified focal spot
and  intensity  for  long  crystals  are  given  by:

greater than the second. As a result, a parallel beam is converted to a parallel beam
with smaller cross profile.

On  the  contrary,  there  are  many  possibilities  to  increase  the  intensity  at  the
focal  spot.  For  example,  the  use  of a  combination  of two  symmetrical  crys-
tals  with  Ld  —  0  filled  by the one beam  as  it  shown  in  Fig.  2(b)  or  the  use
of multiple  beams,  such  as  four  beams  as  shown  in  Fig.  2(c).  Such  config-
uration  can  also  be  used  for  p-p  colliding.  At  this  point  we  should  mention
that  the  collining  applications,  where  the  particle  cycles  through  the  crystal
many times, suffer from serious problems of multiple scattering and radiation
effects.  Perhaps,  the  most  practical  applications  of  focusing  crystals  are  in
the  area  where  the  particle  goes  through  the  crystal  only  ones,  e.g.  two  se-
quential crystals with concave surfaces for high efficient deflection of divergent
beams  [14,9]. If the front face of the crystal has a convex cylindrical form, the
focal distances  of such crystals  might  be considered negative  (imaginary fo-
cus), see Fig.  l(c). Such crystals act in opposite way to the crystal in Fig. l(a)
and  can convert  a convergent  beam pencil to a parallel  beam.  In  general,  the
channeling  trajectories  are  reversible  and  the  reciprocity  principle  is  held  if
the  energy  losses  give  negligible  distortions  [12].  So,  reversing the  beam  (or
changing  input  face  to  output)  in  short  crystals  always  causes  the  opposite
effect.  Some interesting  applications might  come from the  use  of two  crystals
with real and imaginary foci. If their foci are coincided (telescopic configura-
tion)  the  parallel  beam  is  converted  to  another  parallel  beam with  different
width depending on the ratio of their focal distances.  Fig 3 shows an example
of compressing  of the  parallel  beam,  which  can  be  helpful  for  accelerator  and
microbeam applications.

3  Conclusion

Summarizing, bent crystals with special input or output surface can focus and
diverge  beams  of particles.  The  experimental  results  up  to  now  are  far  from
the physical limits of focusing.  It is possible to improve the focal parameters

one order of magnitude. However, special treatments must be done to keep the
quality  of  the  cylindrical  output  surfaces,  which  create  the  focal  convergence.
The  system  of two  crystals  offers  several  other  interesting  applications.  One
of them is the compression of cross section of the ion beam.  Although it may
suffer  from  a  serious  problem  of  losses  the  nowadays  microbeam  applications
requires such devices.

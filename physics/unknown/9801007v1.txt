A new two-parameter family of quasi-exactly solvable quartic polynomial potentials V (x) = −x4 +
2iax3 + (a2 − 2b)x2 + 2i(ab − J)x is introduced. Until now, it was believed that the lowest-degree
one-dimensional quasi-exactly solvable polynomial potential is sextic. This belief is based on the
assumption that the Hamiltonian must be Hermitian. However, it has recently been discovered
that there are huge classes of non-Hermitian, PT -symmetric Hamiltonians whose spectra are real,
discrete, and bounded below. Replacing Hermiticity by the weaker condition of PT symmetry allows
for new kinds of quasi-exactly solvable theories. The spectra of this family of quartic potentials
discussed here are also real, discrete, and bounded below, and the quasi-exact portion of the spectra
consists of the lowest J eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are the roots of a Jth-degree polynomial.

Quantum-mechanical potentials are said to be quasi-
exactly solvable (QES) if a ﬁnite portion of the energy
spectrum and associated eigenfunctions can be found ex-
actly and in closed form [1]. QES potentials depend on
a parameter J; for positive integer values of J one can
ﬁnd exactly the ﬁrst J eigenvalues and eigenfunctions,
typically of a given parity. QES systems can be classiﬁed
using an algebraic approach in which the Hamiltonian is
expressed in terms of the generators of a Lie algebra [2–5].
This approach generalizes the dynamical-symmetry anal-
ysis of exactly solvable quantum-mechanical systems,
whose entire spectrum may be found in closed form by
algebraic means [6].

An especially simple and well known example of a QES

potential [7] is

V (x) = x6 − (4J − 1)x2.

The Schr¨odinger equation, −ψ′′(x)+[V (x)−E]ψ(x) = 0,
has J even-parity solutions of the form

ψ(x) = e−x

The coeﬃcients ck for 0 ≤ k ≤ J − 1 satisfy the recursion
relation

4(J − k)ck−1 + Eck + 2(k + 1)(2k + 1)ck+1 = 0,

(3)

where we deﬁne c−1 = cJ = 0. The simultane-
ous linear equations (3) have a nontrivial solution for
c0, c1, ..., cJ−1 if the determinant of the coeﬃcients van-
ishes. For each integer J this determinant is a polyno-
mial of degree J in the variable E. The roots of this
polynomial are all real and are the J quasi-exact energy
eigenvalues of the potential (1).

The lowest-degree one-dimensional QES polynomial
potential that is discussed in the literature is sextic. How-
ever, in this paper we introduce an entirely new two-
parameter class of QES quartic polynomial potentials.
The spectra of this family of potentials are real, discrete,
and bounded below. Like the eigenvalues of the potential
(1), the lowest J eigenvalues of these potentials are the
roots of a polynomial of degree J.

The potentials introduced here have not been dis-
covered so far because they are associated with non-
Hermitian Hamiltonians. Recently, it has been found
that there are large classes of non-Hermitian Hamilto-
nians whose spectra are real and bounded below [8,9].
Although they are non-Hermitian, these Hamiltonians
exhibit the weaker symmetry of PT invariance. A class
of these Hamiltonians,

H = p2 − (ix)N (N ≥ 2),

was studied in Ref. [8]. The special case N = 4 corre-
sponds to the Hamiltonian

H = p2 − x4.

It is not at all obvious that this Hamiltonian has a pos-
itive, real, discrete spectrum. To verify this property,
we must continue analytically the Schr¨odinger equation
eigenvalue problem associated with H in (4) from the
conventional harmonic oscillator (N = 2) to the case
N = 4. In doing so, the boundary conditions at |x| = ∞
rotate into the complex x plane. At N = 4 the boundary
conditions on the wave function ψ(x) read

(4)

(5)

(6)

lim
|x|→∞

ψ(x) = 0,

where the limit x → ∞ is taken inside two wedges
bounded by the Stokes’ lines of the diﬀerential equation.

The right wedge is bounded by the Stokes’ lines at 0◦ and
−60◦ and the left wedge is bounded by the Stokes’ lines
at −120◦ and −180◦. The leading asymptotic behavior
of the wave function is given by

ψ(x) ∼ e−ix

3

/3

(|x| → ∞).

(7)

It is easy to see that the asymptotic conditions in (6)
are satisﬁed by ψ(x). A complete discussion of the an-
alytic continuation of eigenvalue problems into the com-
plex plane is given in Ref. [10]. Note that for all values of
N between 2 and 4, the Hamiltonian (4) is not symmetric
under parity. This parity noninvariance persists even at
N = 4; eigenfunctions ψ(x) of (5) are not symmetric (or
antisymmetric) under the replacement x → −x.

In this paper we generalize the Hamiltonian (5) to the

two-parameter class

H = p2 − x4 + 2iax3 + (a2 − 2b)x2 + 2i(ab − J)x,

(8)

where a and b are real and J is a positive integer. The
wave function ψ(x) satisﬁes the boundary conditions (6)
and the diﬀerential equation

Eψ(x) = −ψ′′(x) + (cid:2) − x4 + 2iax3 + (a2 − 2b)x2

+ 2i(ab − J)x(cid:3)ψ(x).

We obtain the QES portion of the spectrum of H in

(8) as follows. We make the ansatz

ψ(x) = e−ix

is a polynomial in x of degree J − 1. Substituting ψ(x)
in (10) into the diﬀerential equation (9), dividing oﬀ the
exponential in (10), and collecting powers of x, we obtain
a polynomial in x of degree J − 1. Setting the coeﬃcients
of xk (1 ≤ k ≤ J − 1) to 0 gives a system of J − 1
simultaneous linear equations for the coeﬃcients ck (0 ≤
k ≤ J − 2). We solve these equations and substitute
the values of ck into the coeﬃcient of x0. This gives a
polynomial QJ (E) of degree J in the energy eigenvalue
E. The coeﬃcients of this polynomial are functions of
the parameters a and b of the Hamiltonian H in (8).
The ﬁrst ﬁve of these polynomials are

Q1 = E − b2 − a,
Q2 = E2 − (2b2 + 4a)E + b4 + 4ab2 − 4b + 3a2,
Q3 = E3 − (3b2 + 9a)E2 + (3b4 + 18ab2 − 16b + 23a2)E

The roots of QJ (E) are the QES portion of the spectrum
of H.

The polynomials QJ (E) simplify dramatically if we

E = F + b2 + Ja

K = 4b + a2.

(15)

The roots of these polynomials are all real so long as
K ≥ Kcritical, where Kcritical is a function of J. The
ﬁrst few values of Kcritical are listed in Table I. At K =
Kcritical the lowest two eigenvalues become degenerate
and when K < Kcritical some of the eigenvalues of the
QES spectrum are complex. Thus, the QES spectrum is
entirely real above a parabolic shaped region in the (a, b)
plane bounded by the curve a2 + 4b = Kcritical.

Extensive numerical calculations lead us to believe that
the non-QES spectrum is entirely real throughout the
(a, b) plane and that when K > Kcritical the eigenvalues
of the QES spectrum lie below the eigenvalues of the non-
QES spectrum. However, as we enter the region K <

2

Kcritical some of the eigenvalues of the QES spectrum
pair oﬀ and become complex. Other eigenvalues of the
QES spectrum may cross above the eigenvalues of the
non-QES spectrum. In Fig. 1 we illustrate the case J = 3
and a = 0. Note that for b > 3
4 the QES eigenvalues are
three lowest eigenvalues of the spectrum. When b goes
below 3
4 , two of the QES eigenvalues become complex and
the third moves into the midst of the non-QES spectrum.
The standard way to understand QES theories is to

demonstrate that the Hamiltonian can be expressed in

terms of generators of a Lie algebra. Following Turbiner
[3], we use the generators of a ﬁnite dimensional represen-
tation of the SL(2, Q) with spin J. The three generators
have the form
J + = x2 d
dx

− (J − 1)x, J 0 = x

J − 1
2

d
dx

−

,

J − =

d

.

If we apply the Hamiltonian H in (8) to ψ(x) in (10) and
divide of the exponential we obtain an operator h acting
on the polynomial PJ−1(x); h has the form

h = −

d
dx2 + (2ix2 + 2ax + 2ib)
−[2i(J − 1)x − b2 − a].

d
dx

(16)

(17)

Hence, in terms of the generators of the Lie algebra, we
have

h = −(J −)2 + 2iJ + + 2aJ 0 + 2ibJ − + b2 + aJ.

(18)

This algebraic structure possesses PT symmetry and has
real eigenvalues.

b > 3
4 (corresponding to the critical value Kcritical = 3) the
QES eigenvalues are real and are the three lowest eigenvalues
of the spectrum. When b goes below 3
4 , two of the QES eigen-
values become complex and the third moves into the midst of
the non-QES spectrum. We believe that the non-QES spec-
trum is entirely real throughout the (a, b) plane.

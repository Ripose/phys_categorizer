One set of the Ziolkowski family of exact solutions of the wave equation are shown to 

represent pulses propagating with momentum smaller than energy/c.  This is explicitly 

demonstrated for special cases by calculating the total electromagnetic momentum and 

energy.  The ratio of momentum to energy is a constant smaller than c–1 and so there exists a 

Lorentz transformation to a frame in which the total momentum is zero.  In the zero-

momentum frame the fields are those of an annular pulse converging onto or diverging from 

a focal region. 

 

 

 

It is axiomatic in special relativity that there is no rest frame for light: the speed of 

light is the same in every inertial frame.  It is known, however, that electromagnetic energy 

can travel at less than the speed of light [1], and here we shall show that there exists a Lorentz 

frame L0 in which the total pulse electromagnetic momentum is zero, for a class of solutions 

of the Maxwell equations.

[4] have called the electromagnetic fields derived from (2) “focused single-cycle 

electromagnetic pulses”.  We shall show below that, for an arbitrary electromagnetic pulse, 

the total momentum P and total energy U are both constant in time.  We also show that the 

fields derived from (2) have 

U

.  Thus a Lorentz transformation to a zero-momentum

0L  is possible, and in that frame the fields represent an annular pulse, converging for

there is net forward or backward propagation, in general.)

finite times also.  Thus the total energy and total momentum are constant in time, as we 

would expect.  If the ratio 

UcPz /

 is less than unity, as we shall demonstrate it is in particular 

cases below, we can Lorentz-transform to the zero-momentum frame. 

Since U and P are independent of time, we can evaluate them at

Independently of this interpretation, the fact that

In general, since 

zP  and U have been shown to be independent of time, their ratio is 

also independent of time.  Whenever 

U

, we can transform to a zero-momentum frame.  

<

cPz

We suspect that this is possible for all solutions which represent pulses converging onto and 

then diverging from a focal region. 

According to Adlard, Pike and Sarkar [9], “given any classical solution of the source-

free Maxwell’s equations it is possible to write down a corresponding quantum mechanical 

one-photon state”.  They use a particular case of the Ziolkowski solutions to show that 

“single-photon states with arbitrarily high powers of asymptotic falloff can be explicitly 

constructed”.  The quantum fields resulting from the Ziolkowski family of solutions represent 

(for t > 0) photons diverging from a focal region.  They are rather different from the textbook 

photon, which is monochromatic and unidirectional, with 

=U

ω

h

 and 

zJ

h±=

 or 0.  

Although there is no oscillation in the pulses derived from (2), we can associate an effective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frequency with the pulse as follows: since (

Uc ,P

) is a four-vector, the pulse energy in the 

zero-momentum frame 

0L  is

Both figures show contours of energy density for the TE + iTM pulse with

b

and

 (Figure 2).  The contours are at 0.8, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.2 of the maximum at the given 

value of ct.  In each case the 

 contours are dashed curves, and the

solid curves.  The three-dimensional contour surfaces are obtained by rotating the figures 

about the horizontal (z) axis.  In the

symmetrically from the origin, and the pulse momentum is zero.  In the

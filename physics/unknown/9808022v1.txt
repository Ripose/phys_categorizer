Abstract

We study a generalized notion of two-mode squeezing for the Stokes
and anti-Stokes ﬁelds in a model of a cavity Raman laser, which leads
to a signiﬁcant reduction in decoherence or quantum noise. The model
comprises a loss-less cavity with classical pump, unsaturated medium
and arbitrary homogeneous broadening and dispersion. Allowing for
arbitrary linear combinations of the two modes in the deﬁnition of
quadrature variables, we ﬁnd that there always exists a combination
of the two output modes which exhibits quadrature squeezing with
noise reduction below the vacuum level. The number of noise photons
for this combination mode is proportional to the square root of the
number of Stokes noise photons.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we investigate novel aspects of quantum noise reduction in a
model of a linear multi-channel quantum ampliﬁer. Our investigation deals
with both state reduction, or decoherence, and squeezing for the ampliﬁed
channels.
In fact, both phenomena turn out to be intimately connected.
The model describes stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in a loss-less cavity
with a single Stokes mode, a single anti-Stokes mode and a classical pump.
We assume the Raman medium to be not saturated, but allow for arbitrary
homogeneous broadening and dispersion. The Raman ampliﬁcation process
gives rise to both two-mode squeezing and decoherence for the two optical
ﬁeld modes. We ﬁnd that quantum noise resulting from these processes can
be largely cancelled by appropriate interference arrangements, while main-
taining the full amount of ampliﬁcation.

The ﬁrst arrangement is an ’anti-squeezing’ operation, by which two un-
correlated normal modes are obtained. This operation can be implemented,
for example, by a linear parametric ampliﬁer. If the initial state of ﬁelds,
medium and reservoir is the vacuum, the state for one of the normal modes is
the vacuum, while for the other it is a canonical ensemble of number states.
The average number of ”noise” photons for the latter mode is equal to the
number of phonons in the medium and reservoir states.

The second arrangement involves linear mixing of Stokes and anti-Stokes
without additional squeezing. The state of the resulting mixed mode is a
canonical ensemble of squeezed number states. For a suitable, optimal choice
of mode coeﬃcients, the variance of one of the quadrature phases [1] of
the mode is below the vacuum level, in spite of the additional quantum
noise resulting from decoherence of the mixed state. This result holds for
all values of dispersion, line width and coupling constants. The variance
of the conjugate quadrature is comparable to the variances of the Stokes
quadratures. For large ampliﬁcation, the number of squeezed photons in
the mixed mode is proportional to the square root of the number of Stokes
photons. This represents a signiﬁcant reduction in the amount of decoherence
for the mixed mode, as compared to the original modes.

The use of general mode coeﬃcients amounts to a generalization of the
notion of two-mode squeezing. For conventional two-mode squeezing, both
mode coeﬃcients are chosen to be of equal magnitude. (This is the deﬁni-
tion reported by Loudon and Knight [1]. Caves and Schumaker rescale the

2

 

coeﬃcients by frequency dependent factors, to correct for the frequency de-
pendent relationship between photon and ﬁeld operators [2].) In this case,
the variances of both quadratures and the number of photons of the mixed
mode grow in proportion to the number of Stokes photons, indicating a much
higher level of quantum noise than for the optimal choice of mode coeﬃcients.
The reduction of quantum noise through squeezing has been studied ex-
tensively [1,3]. A squeezed state of a harmonic oscillator is a state for which
the variance in one of the conjugate variables is reduced at the expense of an
increase in the variance of the other variable. (We will not discuss the more
general notions of higher order squeezing which have been deﬁned in terms
of the variance of polynomials of conjugate variables [4,5]. In the context of
quantum optics it has become customary to speak of conjugate variables as
quadrature phases [1]).

For example, the variance in the electric ﬁeld of an optical mode may be
reduced below its vacuum level at the expense of an increased variance in the
magnetic ﬁeld. This situation is desirable for high sensitivity interferometer
experiments [1,6] and optical communications [1,7]. Such squeezed states of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be generated by non-linear optical processes,
such as degenerate parametric ampliﬁcation or four-wave mixing, in which
photons are created in pairs.
if two
photons at diﬀerent frequencies are generated, squeezing is not found for
each of the individual modes, but rather for linear combinations of the two.
This is known as two-mode squeezing, and its experimental detection requires
an additional coherent source at the sum- or diﬀerence frequency [1]. Two-
mode squeezing is conventionally deﬁned in terms of linear combinations with
equal mode coeﬃcients [1,2]. We will show in this paper that, for situations
where decoherence occurs, this is not an optimal deﬁnition, and that it is
useful to adjust the mode coeﬃcients to compensate for diﬀerent noise levels
in the two modes.

If the process is non-degenerate, i.e.

The generation of squeezed light involves an ampliﬁcation process, and
this is frequently associated with state reduction or decoherence. State re-
duction (the transformation of a pure state into a statistical mixture) oc-
curs due to the coupling of the observed modes to a number of unobserved
or unobservable modes. The process of state reduction in linear quantum
ampliﬁers has been studied for various types of models, and the following
references represent just a small selection of papers which are of interest here
[8,9,10]. Such models are of great interest for the description of dissipation in

3

 

quantum systems [9,10], and for the analysis of state reduction in quantum
measurement theory [8,10]. Most studies refer to harmonic oscillator models
involving a small number of observable variables, and a large or inﬁnite num-
ber of unobserved ’reservoir’ oscillators. The time evolution of the ampliﬁer
can be described either by master equations for the observable degrees of
freedom [10], or by exact solutions for the linear equations of motion of the
complete system [8,9,10].

The exact solutions reveal that, for these models, the time evolution is
a multi-mode squeezing transformation coupling the observed variables and
the reservoir. The amount of squeezing in the observable variables depends
on the type of model studied. If the coupling to the reservoir involves only
one of the conjugate variables, an initial rapid buildup of decoherence and
squeezing for that variable occurs on a very short time-scale, of the order
In addition, decoherence for both
of the reservoir coherence time [9,10].
conjugate variables increases on a much longer time scale, given by the dissi-
pation rate of the reservoir. In quantum optics it is customary to employ the
‘rotating wave approximation’ (RWA), in which the coupling involves both
conjugate variables of the observable system in a symmetric fashion. In this
approximation, single-mode squeezing is absent, and decoherence occurs on
the longer, dissipative time scale [9,10]. The cavity SRS ampliﬁer studied
here is in this category.

So far, studies of quantum ampliﬁers in the RWA have emphasized either
the process of state reduction, or the generation of squeezed states. However,
both aspects are intimately connected. The authors found in [11] that, for
the simplest case of a single mode ampliﬁer coupled to an inﬁnite reservoir,
the time evolution results in two-mode squeezing for the ampliﬁer mode and
a single, time-dependent reservoir mode. If only the ampliﬁer mode is ob-
served, no squeezing is found, and the density matrix contains a large number
of pure components, proportional to the ampliﬁcation factor. If, on the other
hand, both the ampliﬁer mode and the large-time limit of the special reser-
voir mode are observed, the density matrix contains only a small number
of squeezed pure components. Similar results were found for a model of a
single mode laser, comprising a single radiation mode, an inverted medium
and a reservoir. To the best of our knowledge, these connections between the
choice of observed mode combinations, the degree of state reduction and the
degree of squeezing have not been systematically explored so far.

The linear cavity Raman ampliﬁer studied here is of particular interest,

4

 

both because of the type of interactions found in this system, and as an
object for experimental study. The medium is assumed to contain a large
number of unsaturated Raman active molecules or atoms, and is modelled by
a single oscillator mode. The coupling between Stokes and medium oscillator
is of squeezing type. However, since the medium is not directly observable,
two-mode variables constructed from these two modes have no experimen-
tal signiﬁcance. On the other hand, the coupling between anti-Stokes and
medium conserves photon-phonon number, and the anti-Stokes mode can
therefore be considered as a probe of the medium.
In fact, the squeezing
transformation occurring between Stokes and medium is reﬂected in corre-
sponding correlations between Stokes and anti-Stokes. While the coupling
between anti-Stokes and medium is in most cases stronger than the Stokes
coupling, the inﬂuence of the anti-Stokes on the medium is reduced by disper-
sion, which leads to a frequency detuning of the anti-Stokes. It is therefore
of interest to study the behavior of the CRA over the whole range of relevant
parameters, including dispersion, homogeneous line width and gain. Experi-
mentally, all of these parameters can be controlled independently, by varying
the pressure of the gaseous Raman medium, the type of medium and the
pump intensity.

Cavity SRS models with Stokes and anti-Stokes modes have been studied
by several authors. Non-linear, micro-maser models of SRS in a cavity with a
single three-level atom and without dispersion were studied by Law et al. [12]
and Puri et al. [13]. The latter found noise reduction below the vacuum level
with the conventional notion of two-mode squeezing for certain values of the
number of passes and the passing time of the atom through the cavity. Linear
oscillator models of the medium and reservoir had been studied earlier by
Walls [14] and Perina [15] for arbitrary dispersion and for the limiting case of
large line width, where the medium oscillators are eliminated adiabatically.
These studies were mainly concerned with photon statistics, and give no
explicit discussion of squeezing. The ﬁrst detailed study of squeezing in this
type of models was done by Chizhov et al., who studied quadrature and
higher order squeezing for the case of zero dispersion in a cavity [16,17]. A
free-propagation ampliﬁer was studied by Yeong et. al. [18]. In the limit of
large line width [16], quadrature squeezing was reported to be absent, while
such squeezing was found for the case of small line width in [17] and [18].
These studies discuss conventional two-mode quadrature squeezing in terms
of the variance of one of the two-mode quadratures.

5

  

Our present work studies the linear cavity SRS model for arbitrary values
of line width and dispersion. (The case of zero dispersion is rather special, in
that Stokes, anti-Stokes and the medium undergo damped oscillations. For
non-zero dispersion, exponential ampliﬁcation occurs.) Two-mode quadra-
ture squeezing is deﬁned in terms of the ratio of the variances of two con-
jugate two-mode quadratures, with arbitrary mode coeﬃcients. We give
explicit expressions for the Wigner characteristic function of the entangled
state of Stokes and anti-Stokes modes, and determine those values of the
mode coeﬃcients, for which maximal squeezing and minimal state-reduction
occur.

In section 2.1, we give the model equations for the amplitude operators,
derive the general form of solutions, and calculate the variance of a general
Hermitean combination of the two optical modes for the case where the initial
state at time t=0 is the vacuum. As is well known, this uniquely determines
the Wigner characteristic function, and thereby the Schr¨odinger state at later
times t > 0. In section 2.2, we show that the reduced state of Stokes and
anti-Stokes is a product of the vacuum and a canonical ensemble of number
states for two uncorrelated normal modes. These normal modes are obtained
from the original optical modes by an ‘anti-squeezing’ transformation, and
we show that this transformation can be realized by a linear parametric
In section 2.3, we study ‘non-squeezed’ linear combinations of
ampliﬁer.
the two optical modes, and generalize the corresponding notion of two-mode
squeezing by admitting arbitrary mode coeﬃcients. We show that, at any
given time t, it is possible to choose optimal mode coeﬃcients in such a way,
that one of the quadratures has minimal variance below the vacuum level
at that time. This choice also leads to minimal decoherence. In situations
where the system shows exponential ampliﬁcation, the number of photons in
the optimal mode is proportional to the square root of the number of Stokes
photons, indicating a much higher level of quantum coherence than for the
Stokes mode. In section 2.4, we consider ampliﬁcation of an initial coherent
state of the Stokes mode. The coherent state is maximally ampliﬁed if it is at
90 degrees relative to the minimal two-mode quadrature, and gives the same
output as the vacuum if it is parallel to that quadrature. In the former case,
amplitude ﬂuctuations are enhanced, while phase ﬂuctuations are below the
vacuum level.

In section 3.1 we give the general solution to the linear equations of motion
for optical modes and medium in terms of the eigenvalues of the 3x3 matrix

6

      

of coeﬃcients. We discuss the special cases of zero and large line width in
sections 3.2 and 3.3, and the intermediate case of ﬁnite line width in section
3.4. In particular, we consider the inﬂuence of dispersion on the long-time
behavior of the system. For zero line width, there exists a critical value of
dispersion, below which the system shows periodic or quasi-periodic behavior,
and above which exponential ampliﬁcation occurs. For non-zero line width,
the system always shows exponential ampliﬁcation at large times, except for
zero dispersion, where the behavior is that of damped oscillations.

In section 4, we summarize our ﬁndings and discuss some possible implica-
tions for a deeper understanding of state reduction in more general systems.

ing

2.1 Model equations and characteristic functions

Our model of a cavity Raman laser contains the following variables: a classi-
cal pump at frequency ω0, a Raman-active medium with transition frequency
ω3, a reservoir of oscillators with frequencies ωr, r = 4...N , modelling homo-
geneous broadening of the Raman transition, a Stokes mode at frequency
ω3, and an anti-Stokes mode at frequency ω2 = ω0 + ω3 + ∆. The
ω1 = ω0 −
parameter ∆ is a frequency detuning of the anti-Stokes mode which results
from dispersion in the Raman-active medium. Figure 1 shows a level diagram
of the medium, including the Raman transition, two transient intermediate
states and the three optical frequencies ω0, ω1, and ω2.

The medium is assumed to be only weakly excited, with most of its popu-
lation in the ground state. It can therefore be modelled by a single harmonic
oscillator. We write the Heisenberg operators ˜bn(t), n = 1...N for all vari-
ables involved as products of time-dependent phase factors and amplitude
operators bn(t):

˜b1(t) = e−

This shows that the reduced state for the two normal modes is the product

vacuum state for c2. In particular, the normal modes are uncorrelated and
not squeezed. The number n′1 of photons in mode c1 is equal to

equation (18) is the original time-evolution, equation (5). As we shall see
below, this situation occurs for Γ=∆=0 periodically at certain times t > 0.
It is remarkable that, even for R2 > 1, one of the normal modes is always

found in the vacuum state.

A physical interpretation of the normal modes ci can be given in terms
of an “anti-squeezing” experiment, performed on the output of the cavity
Raman laser. Inverting equations (18), we ﬁnd

This is a squeezing operation performed on the modes b1 and b2, which can be
implemented, for example, by a non-degenerate linear parametric ampliﬁer
(LPA) [3]. If the Stokes and anti-Stokes modes are used as idler and signal
in a phase-matched linear ampliﬁer, the equations for propagation in the

Equations (19) and (23) show that, at any given time t, this operation will
disentangle the state of Stokes and anti-Stokes modes, leading to zero corre-
lation between the new modes c1 and c2 and to zero photon count for mode
c2. We illustrate the sequence of squeezing and “anti-squeezing” operations

anti-Stokes

terms of the variance of the Hermitian components [1]:

A state is two-mode squeezed for b1 and b2 if it is squeezed for b. The con-
ventional deﬁnition of squeezing is that the variance of one of the Hermitian
components is below the vacuum value 1

Because of the uncertainty relations, this implies that

In this paper, we use the term ”squeezed state” for states satisfying the
weaker condition (35). If the state is a minimal uncertainty state, e.g. the
vacuum state, one has

< (∆XP )2 >< (∆XQ)2 > =

1
4

and equation (35) implies (34). For states satisfying equation (35) but not
(36), however, the variance of both components may exceed the vacuum
value.

To generalize the notion of two-mode squeezing, we ﬁrst admit arbitrary

coeﬃcients zi in the deﬁnition of the linear combination b

b = z1b1 + z2b2

;

2 +

z1|
|

z2|

2 = 1 .

Second, we allow arbitrary phase factors in the deﬁnition of quadratures. We
thus consider a general Hermitian linear combination of b and b† as in the
deﬁnition (7) and (8) of the characteristic function

φ1 = α∗b† + αb

i

√2 or α = −

For α = 1
√2 , one has φ1 = XQ or φ1 = XP . To determine the
degree of squeezing of a given state, one needs to ﬁnd those values of α with
= 1
√2 , for which the variance of φ1 assumes maximal and minimal values

+ and ϕ2
ϕ2
. We now apply this procedure to the Stokes and anti-Stokes
−
modes deﬁned above.

From equations (38) and (8) we ﬁnd that the characteristic function of
the mode b in equation (37) is obtained from the general expressions (11)
and (12) by setting α1 = αz1 and α2 = αz2. Thus

β∗1 = α∗z∗1T11 + αz2T21 .

This gives for the variance ϕ2

1 of φ1 (see equation 12):

2.4 Ampliﬁcation of coherent states

In this section, we calculate the ﬁnal state for the linear combination mode,
as discussed in section (2.3), for the case where the initial state is a coherent
state for the Stokes ﬁeld, and the vacuum state for all other variables.

The characteristic function is that of a canonical ensemble of coherent, squeezed
number states with coherent displacement parameter δ (see Appendix A.1).
The parameter δ is maximal for real ν1, and vanishes for imaginary ν1. On the
other hand, the variance ϕ2
1 is maximal for real α, and minimal for imaginary
α. The ampliﬁed state therefore shows phase squeezing. The ampliﬁcation
and squeezing transformations in the complex ν plane are illustrated in ﬁgure
3.

3 Solutions of the model equations

3.1 General case

The matrix coeﬃcients Ti1(t) are obtained as the classical solutions to equa-
tions (1), (2), and (6) with Ti1(0) = δi1. They take the form:

Ti1(t) =

τikeλkt

(i = 1, 2, 3)

(55)

Xk

where λk are the eigenvalues of the matrix representing the right-hand side of
equations (1), (2), and (6) (see appendix A.2). The general form of the eigen-
values depends on the relative size of the gain coeﬃcients κi (i = 1, 2). These
coeﬃcients contain a factor involving the frequency of the mode considered.
Except for a situation where the Stokes coeﬃcient shows large resonant en-
hancement over the anti-Stokes coeﬃcient, one has κ2 >κ1. We restrict our
discussion to this case.

In this case, the eigenvalues are either purely imaginary, or there is an
eigenvalue with positive real part. In the former case, the matrix coeﬃcients
Ti1 show periodic or quasi-periodic behavior in time. In the latter case, the
term involving an eigenvalue with positive real part dominates (55) for large
times, and equation (45) holds. We now discuss some special cases.

3.2 Hypertransient limit

In the hypertransient limit, we set Γ = 0. There are two regimes, determined
by a certain critical value ∆crit of ∆. For ∆ < ∆crit, the anti-Stokes mode
dominates. The eigenvalues are all purely imaginary and the system shows
quasi-periodic behavior. For ∆ = 0, one of the eigenvalues is zero, and the
matrix coeﬃcients Ti1(t) are periodic, with frequency

In this case, two

of the eigenvalues are very close to each other, (λ3 −

and the matrix coeﬃcients Ti1(t) are mostly dominated by the corresponding
terms with small frequency denominator ǫ. Consequently, the variance ϕ2

is almost constant, except for short time periods, during which these terms
are small due to their explicit time-dependence on sin ǫt. The behavior of
conv is much greater than 1
ϕ2
2 ,
except for the short time periods mentioned, and is not shown in this ﬁgure.
For ∆ = ∆crit, the matrix coeﬃcients grow linearly in time, while for
∆ > ∆crit, one of the eigenvalues has a positive real part. As mentioned
above, the corresponding term in equation (55) dominates the behavior for
large times, and the variance ϕ2
min approaches a constant value. For this
situation, we also plot the variance ϕ2
f ix obtained for a ﬁxed choice of mode
coeﬃcients zi, which gives almost minimal variance for large t. Figure (4.3)

3.3 Steady-state case

In the steady-state limit, it is assumed that the homogeneous line width Γ
is much larger than any of the frequencies κ1, κ2 and ∆. In this limit, the
mode operator b3 is approximated by its steady-state value, and we obtain
the following equations:

1(κ1b†1 + κ2b2 + F )

b3 = Γ−

These equations are equivalent to the model studied in references [14] and
[16]. The matrix coeﬃcients Ti1 are given by a formula analogous to (55),
but involving only the two eigenvalues corresponding to equation (58). The
eigenvalues are:

For ∆ > 0, one of the eigenvalues is positive , while the other is negative.

recovered. For intermediate values of ∆, one eigenvalue has positive real part,
and the behavior of the variance for large times is similar to the steady-state
case.

4 Summary and Discussion

For the model of a linear cavity Raman ampliﬁer studied here, we found
two main results. First, there exist uncorrelated normal modes, which are

20

 
 
 
    

obtained from the Stokes and anti-Stokes modes by an anti-squeezing trans-
formation. Second, there exist optimal linear combination modes, for which
the variance of one quadrature is always below the vacuum value. The states
of such optimal modes are canonical ensembles of coherent squeezed number
states, and the average number of noise photons is proportional to the square
root of the number of Stokes noise photons. Thus, the degree of decoherence
for the combination mode is much less than for the individual Stokes and
anti-Stokes modes.

The reduction of variance in the minimal quadrature of the optimal com-
bination mode can be understood as resulting from a cancellation of anti-
correlated quantum noise in the individual modes. To optimize the amount
of cancellation, the mode coeﬃcients have to be chosen appropriately, and
will in general not be of equal magnitude. This corresponds to a generaliza-
tion of the conventional notion of two-mode squeezing.

If a coherent state is used as input to the Stokes channel of the ampliﬁer,
the corresponding ﬁeld amplitude will be cancelled in the combination mode,
if it has the same phase as the minimal quadrature, and will be optimally
ampliﬁed if its phase diﬀers by
90 degrees. The optimally ampliﬁed signal
is thus phase-squeezed.

±

These results may be of interest for the generation of squeezed light
through stimulated Raman scattering. They also provide clear experimen-
tal signatures for the experimental observation of anti-correlation between
Stokes and anti-Stokes. It is of particular interest, that these signatures are
found for all values of the experimentally relevant parameters, such as pump
amplitude, dispersion and line widths. Previous work on quadrature squeez-
ing in this model had been restricted to a limited range of parameters (small
linewidth, zero dispersion).

With the recent demonstration of a cw-Raman laser by J.K. Brasseur et
[19], experiments to verify our predictions may become feasible in the

al.
near future.

Figure Captions

Figure 1. Shown are the two levels of the Raman transition at frequen-
cies ω = 0 and ω = ω3, and two intermediate levels at frequencies ω = ω0
and ω = ω0 + ω3 for Stokes and anti-Stokes generation. The corresponding
absorption of pump radiation and generation of Stokes and anti-Stokes is
indicated by vertical and horizontal arrows. The anti-Stokes mode at fre-
quency ω = ω0 + ω3 + ∆ and its driving polarization at ω = ω0 + ω3 are
represented by two diﬀerent lines, separated by the frequency detuning ∆.

Figure 2 illustrates the sequence of entangling and dis-entangling operations
performed by the cavity Raman laser (CRL) and linear parametric ampliﬁer
(LPA). The uncorrelated states of the initial Stokes and anti-Stokes modes a1
and a2, and of the ﬁnal normal modes c1 and c2, are represented by disjoint
circles, while the entangled state of the intermediate, ampliﬁed Stokes and
anti-Stokes modes b1 and b2 is represented by a single ellipse. The quantities
n1 and n2 are the corresponding photon numbers.

Figure 3 illustrates the eﬀect of ampliﬁcation on the coherent states of the
near-optimal combination mode b. The coherent states are represented by
ellipses in the complex ν plane, which are centered at the coherent displace-
ment parameter ν = ν1 for the initial states and ν = δ for the ﬁnal states.
The axes of the ellipses are proportional to the root of the variances of the
corresponding quadratures. The arrows connect the initial state to the ﬁnal
state resulting from ampliﬁcation. Case (a) represents the vacuum going to a
squeezed state. Cases (b), (c) and (d) represent various initial coherent states

(b) going to the same state as (a), and (c) going to the same state as (d).

Figures 4.a to 4.d. Shown are the variances of the minimal quadrature vari-
able for the choice of conventional, ﬁxed and minimizing mode coeﬃcients
(ϕ2

Charges  on  the  dust  grains  immersed  in  a  plasma  vary  in  time.  We  follow  the  hydrodynamic  approach  to  obtain  dispersion 
relations  for  some  low  frequency  electrostatic  modes,  taking  into  account  charge  fluctuation  on  the  dust.  We  have  used  the

grains causes different effects in different frequency regimes. 
 
Computational model 
This  is  the  description  of  the  one  dimensional  fully  electromagnetic  particle  code.  The  descriptions  are  intended  to  clarify 
largly the code write-up to better follow its algorithm in a concise manner.

z   are 
considered  a  half  dimension  each).    Electrons  and  ions  though  are  followed  in  time  using  the  self  consistent  electrom agnetic 
fields in the simulations. 
    The  magnetic  field  B has  only  two  components  (transverse),

The  evolution  of  the  trajectories  of  the  electrons  in  their  self  consistent  electromagnetic  fields  can  be  approximated  to  zeroth 
order by the linearized nonrelativistic fluid equations

velocity interpolated to the mesh from the particle distributions are the same.

Here  the  superscripts  represent  temporal  difference  indices,  and  clearly  the  objective  is  to  go  from  the  step  n  to 
  as  the  middle  step  quantities  used  to  time  center  the  difference  equations  and  therefore  make  the  time

advancement  second  order  accurate.  This  set  can  be  solved  exactly  for  all  the 
 
dependent  v ’s  to  the  left  and  all  the  n   dependent  v ’s  to  the  right,  and  use  matrix  inversion.  This  is  how  the  model  pushes 
particles in time. 
          Finally  the  last  but  not  the  least  item  in  this  section  is  the  interpolation  from  the  particles  to  the  mesh  and  from  the  mesh  to 
the  particles.  In  this  version  of  the  code  the  so  called  nearest  grid  point  interpolation  which  is  a  zeroth  order  interpolation  is 
implemented;  i.e.,  the  charge  and  currents  of  a  particle  are  completely  given  to  the  grid  point  closest  to  it.  This  procedure  is 
indeed  a  very  noisy  and  dissipative  one,  but  in  order  to  make  it  somewhat  smoother,  in  this  code,  there  are  contributions  made 
to  the  grid  points  on  the  left  and  right  of  the  nearest  grid  point;  these  contributions  are  of  equal  magnitude  and  opposite  sign, 
with  the  positive  contribution  going  into  the  grid  point  closer  to  the  particle  and  the  negative  contribution  to  the  grid  point 
further  apart  from  the  particle.  Particles  on  the  other  hand  receive  electric  and  magnetic  fields  from  the  nearest  grid  points  by 
the  same  interpolation  from  their  nearest  grid  point.  The  symmetry  of  interpolation  between  the  particles  and  the  grid  points 
insures momentum conservation and zero (to round off) self-forces. 
 
Conclusions 
We  have  shown  that  the  coupling  of  charge  relaxation  of  the  dust  grains  with  Langmuir  waves  leads  to  decay  of  the  latter.  That 
is,  there  can  be  energy  transfer  between  the  plasma  waves  and  the  dust  charging  process.  Similar  decay  are  expected  to  occur 
for  high  frequency  waves.  It  is  not  clear  how  the  present  decay  saturated.  Over  longer  times,  we  have  the  short  growing  stage, 
the  usual  quasi  linear  and  nonlinear  mechanisms  fr  decay  saturation,  here  there  is  also  the  possibility  of  enhanced  shielding  of 
the dust grains. 
We  should  emphasize  that  result  such  as  the  present  one  are  strongly  dependent  on  the  model  of  the  dusty  plasma.  In  particular 
case,  when  the  total  charge  is  conserved,  the  total  number  of  electrons  and  ions  conserved.  In  the  other  model  with  infinite 
plasma, the number of electrons and ions is conserved, so the charge is not conserved. 
Figure  1  shows  the  dust  charge  versus  time.  The  dust  charge  is  negative  but  in  the  figure  absolute  value  of  charge  is  expected.

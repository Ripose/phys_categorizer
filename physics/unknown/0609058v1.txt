INTRODUCTION 

Problem  of  Phase  Transition  (PT)  is  of  traditional  great  interest  in  astrophysics 
[1,2,3] as well as in general theory of so-called Strongly Coupled Coulomb Systems 
(SCCS) during very long time. Problem of Wigner crystallization in mixture of C(6+) 
and  O(8+)  nuclei  during  cooling  of  white  dwarfs  [2]  there  exists  very  interesting 
problem  of  stratified  layers  of  high-Z  crystals  in  outer  core  of  neutron  stars  [4]. 
Besides crystallization the so-called hypothetical ‘Plasma Phase Transition’ (PPT) [5] 
and  He/H2  phase  decomposition  [6]  are  examples  of  fluid-fluid  phase  transitions, 
which are of great interest for the theory of cooling of interiors of Giant Planets (GP) 
and Brawn Dwarfs (BD) [7] (see also paper [8]).  

Besides the study of hypothetical PT in real plasmas a complementary approach is 
developing where the main subject of interest is definitely existing PT-s in simplified 
plasma  models  [9,10].  The  well-known  prototype  model  is  OCP  with  a  rigid 
background (notation – OCP(#)). This variant of OCP is studied carefully nowadays. 
The  system  cannot  collapse  or  explode  spontaneously.  The  only  phase  transition  – 
crystallization – occurs in OCP(#) without any density change. More realistic model is 
One  Component  Plasma  on  uniform,  but  compressible  compensating  background 
(following notation – OCP(~)). One of the simplest example of OCP(~) is the model 
of  classical  point  charges  on  uniform  compressible  background  if  ideal  fermi-gas  of 
electrons. 

Transition  to  the  OCP  on  uniform  and  compressible  background  leads  to 
appearance  of  a  new  first-order  phase  transitions  of  gas-liquid  type  [10,11].  New 
phase  diagram  combines  previous  crystallization,  now  with  a  finite  density  change, 
with  a  qualitatively  different  coexistence  curve  of  the  new  phase  transition  [12]. 
Obviously the structure and parameters of this phase diagram strongly depend on the 
value of charge number Z. This fact is illustrated at general phase diagram Figure 1. 

 

TOPOLOGY OF PHASE DIAGRAMS IN OCP(~) MODEL 

Four  qualitatively  different  situations  should  be  distinguished  for  the  OCP(~) 

depending on the value of charge number Z: 

 
1) Low value of charge number 
 
2) High value of charge number 
3) Intermediate value of charge number 
 
4) Boundary value of intermediate charge number interval

1, 10, and 100 are shown (rS = 100 corresponds to the cold melting of electron Wigner crystal [13]). 

 

Low Values of Charge Number (Z ~ 1) 

Phase  diagram  of  the  model  was  carefully  studied  in  [10,11,12].  The  ordinary 
structure of global phase diagram was obtained in this case: i.e. the relative position of 
critical  and  triple  points,  of  melting  zone  and  gas-liquid  and  gas-crystal  coexistence, 
all are totally equivalent to those for ordinary substances (see Figure 2 and Figure 3).

and ТС is critical temperature of fluid-gas phase transition. Notations: a and b mass-asymmetrical model

OCP(~) Phase Diagram at High Values of Charge Number 

Highly  anomalous  structure  of  global  phase  diagram  was  discovered  at  previous 
study of the OCP(~) at very high values of charge number Z >> Z2*≈ 45 [10,11]. In 
this  case  the  melting  «stripe»  (Г ≡  (Ze)2/kTa ≈ 175)  crosses  low-density  ‘slope’  of 
two-phase  coexistence  domain  of  the  new  phase  transition.  Following  features  are 
typical for this type of phase diagram (see the variant Z = 100 at Figure 1 for details): 

•  Triple point is placed at low-density ‘slope’ of two-phase boundary. 
•  Critical point is placed at crystalline part of two-phase coexistence domain. 
•  Crystal-crystal coexistence of two crystalline phases, dense and expanded ones, 
with the same lattice occurs in OCP(~) at such high values of charge number Z. 

Intermediate Values of Charge Number (Z1* < Z < Z2*) 

The  most  remarkable  anomalous  phase  diagram corresponds to the case when the 
melting line of prototype OCP(#) model (Г ~ Гmelt ≈ 175) crosses coexistence curve of 
the new gas-liquid phase transition just closely to its critical point. As a result of this 
coincidence: 

•  The  only  phase  transition  exists  in  the  model.  It  corresponds  to  the  unified 
global  crystal–fluid  coexistence,  i.e.  continuous  superposition  of  melting  and 
sublimation (see Figure 4). 
•  There is no true critical point. 
•  There is no triple point. 
•  Coexistence curve in P-T (pressure-temperature) plane is a continuous, infinite 

curve (Figure 5).

Boundary Values of Charge Number Interval (Z = Z1*& Z2*) 

Remarkable  feature  of  phase  diagram  of  OCP(~)  model  in  the  case  Z = Z1*  or 
Z = Z2*  is  an  existence  of  pseudo-critical  point  where  the  well-known  standard 
 and (

fluid part of crystal-fluid binodal (Figure 6) and at Z = Z2* ≈ 45.4 – on crystalline part

fits  for  equation  of  state  of  both  subsystems,  OCP(#)  and  background,  we  obtain 
following parameters of the both pseudo-critical points:

Critical exponents 

Remarkable feature of two discussed pseudo-critical points at Z = Z1*or Z = Z2* is 
the non-standard values of all critical exponents in comparison with the ordinary (Van 
der Waals like) critical exponents, which correspond to the case of OCP(~) with the 
charge  number  Z  beyond  the  discussed  interval  Z1*÷Z2*.  For  example,  at  the  latter 
case  Z  <  Z1*  or  Z  >  Z2*,  the  standard  density-temperature  relation  is  valid  for  the 
density at coexistence curve ρ(T) [ρ(T) – ρC] ~ |T – TC|1/2. At the same time in the case 
Z  =  Z1*  or  Z  =  Z2*  at  pseudo-critical  points  the  following  relation  may  be  proved 
[ρ(T) – ρC] ~ |T – TC|1/3

 (see [12]). 

GENERAL CHARACTER OF ANOMALOUS PHASE DIAGRAMS 

Anomalous phase diagram with an unique phase equilibrium crystal–fluid is not a 
exclusive  feature  of  OCP(~)  model.  The  same  behavior  is  quite  common  for  some 
systems  with  traditional  inter-particles  interaction,  which  combines  intensive  shot-
range repulsion and finite in depth and spread attraction. For instance, transition from 
“normal”  phase  diagram  to  anomalous  one  has  been  observed  in  the  one  component 
system of hard spheres with additional short-range Yukawa-like attraction:

Analytical and numerical modeling of this system along with experimental results 
(large colloidal particles in polymer solution) show the effect qualitatively similar to 
one  in  OCP(~)  model  when  ions  charge  Zi  tend  to  the  interval  [Z1*÷  Z2*].  That  is 
gradual  closing  triple  and  critical  points  right  up  to  their  merging  and  formation  a 
single crystal-fluid phase boundary (Figure 8(a,b)).

CONCLUSIONS 

Anomalous  phase  diagrams  are  quite  common  phenomena  in  idealized  Coulomb 
systems  with  high  values  of  charge  number  Z.  Similar  topology  of  phase  diagram 
could be expected at some conditions at astrophysical objects. Using rather simple but 
modified  plasma  models  it  is  possible  to  calculate  explicitly  all  parameters  of  such 
anomalous phase transitions and clarify the peculiar topology of its phase diagrams.

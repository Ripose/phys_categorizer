Abstract.  The  objective  was  to  study  uncertainty  in  an-
tenna input impedance resulting from full one-port Vector 
Network Analyzer (VNA) measurements. The VNA process 
equation in the reflection coefficient ρ of a load, its meas-
urement  m  and  three  errors  Es  -determinable  from  three 
standard  loads  and  their  measurements-  was  considered. 
Differentials were selected to represent measurement inac-
curacies  and  load  uncertainties  (Differential  Errors).  The 
differential  operator  was  applied  on  the  process  equation 
and  the  total  differential  error  dρ  for  any  unknown  load 
(Device  Under  Test  DUT)  was  expressed  in  terms  of  dEs 
and dm, without any simplification. Consequently, the dif-
ferential error of input impedance Z -or any other physical 
quantity differentiably dependent on ρ- is expressible. Fur-
thermore,  to  express  precisely  a  comparison  relation  be-
tween  complex  differential  errors,  the  geometric  Differen-
tial Error Region and its Differential Error Intervals were 
defined. Practical results are presented for an indoor UHF 
ground-plane antenna in contrast with a common 50 Ω DC 
resistor  inside  an  aluminum  box.  These  two  built,  un-
shielded and shielded, DUTs were tested against frequency 
under  different  system  configurations  and  measurement 
considerations.  Intermediate  results  for  Es  and  dEs  char-
acterize the measurement system itself. A number of calcu-
lations and illustrations demonstrate the application of the 
method.

1.  Introduction 

In  full  one-port measurements with a vector network 
analyzer  (VNA) of real characteristic impedance Z0, a de-
vice under test (DUT) with impedance Z has a complex re-
flection coefficient ρ defined by 

  ρ = (Z − Z0)/(Z + Z0) 

(1) 

 

 

and related to its complex VNA measurement m by a bilin-
ear transformation  

  ρ = (m − D)/[M(m − D) + R] 

(2) 

in  which  all  the quantities are implicitly dependent on the 
frequency.  

The quantities D, M and R have been defined as sys-
tem  errors  Es  and  a  physical  meaning  has  been  given  to 
them  [1].  Accordingly,  D  is  the  directivity  error  ED,  M  is 
the source match error EM and R is the frequency response 
error  ER.  Although  it  is  possible  to  define  Es  in  terms  of 
elementary  circuit  quantities,  as  it  has  been  analytically 
proven  by  the  authors  for  typical  VNA  system  configura-
tions that will be described in the following, this analysis is 
too extensive to be reproduced here. The resulting equiva-
lent error model is shown as flow graph in Fig. 1.

Mathematically,  transformation  (2)  can  be  uniquely 
determined from three given distinct values ρ = ρk (k = 1, 
2, 3), with modulus |ρk| and argument θk, and respectively 
known  m  =  mk,  with  modulus  |mk|  and  argument  ϕk  [2]. 
This determination expresses D, M and R in terms of three 
standard  reflection  coefficient  values  and  corresponding 
VNA measurements. Since ρ of any unknown DUT is cal-
culated by (2), the measurement system itself is character-
ized  mainly  by  the  D,  M  and  R  in  terms  of  frequency. 
Therefore, ρ is calculated from seven complex numbers: m, 
mk and ρk. However, since the four measurements have in-
accuracy and the three standard loads uncertainty, there is 
an error (uncertainty) in the value of ρ. In addition, since ρ 
is a complex number, this error in ρ has a geometric repre-
sentation as a region of the complex plane that may be used 
efficiently in comparison issues.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, for the ρ error 

  M = [c(B − A) + a(C − B) + b(A − C)]/F 

estimation and its geometric representation:  

(a)  There  are  several  numerical  techniques  based  on 
the  simplest  approximation  of  ρ  error  by  the  ΔS11  ≅  |m|  − 
|ρ|  equation  of  measurement  uncertainty,  which  is  graphi-
cally represented by a circle of radius |ΔS11| around ρ [3]-
[4].  

(b)  There  are  analytic  methods  using  partial  deriva-
tives  for  specific  or  nonspecific  ρk  values,  to  estimate  the 
influence  of  one  or  more  standard  load  uncertainties  -but 
not  of  the  inaccuracies  of  measurements-  on  the  ρ  error. 
The  most  complete  of  them  is  perhaps  the  work  of 
Stumper, who studied full two-port VNA measurements in 
2003  [5].  However,  although  full  one-port  measurements 
can be considered in general as a simplified application of 
two-port measurements, the partial deviations, for the three 
load uncertainties given in [5], cannot be generalized to in-
clude the four measurement inaccuracies.  

(c) There is no analytic expression using the total dif-

ferential dρ or method using its geometric representation. 

In this paper, the complete expression of the total dif-
ferential error dρ for the reflection coefficient ρ and its ex-
act  geometric  representation  are  expressed,  without  any 
simplification due to a particular load value and/or a negli-
gible load uncertainty and/or an insignificant measurement 
inaccuracy.  Thus,  the  expression  for  the  differential  error 
of  any  physical  quantity,  differentiably  dependent  on  the 
reflection  coefficient,  is  made  possible.  This  includes  the 
case  of  the  uncertainty  of  the  input  impedance  Z  that  can 
always  be  expressed  by  (1)  in  terms  of  ρ  and  practically 
used,  as  long  as  a  pair  of  input  terminals  can  be  well  de-
fined for the DUT.

ess equation in five complex variables 

ρmM − ρMD + ρR − m + D = 0 

(3) 

The  application  of  the  differential  operator  to  (3)  resulted 
in a process equation in five differentials 

   (1−ρΜ)dD + ρ(m − D)dΜ + ρdR  

+ [R + Μ(m − D)]dρ +  (ρΜ − 1)dm = 0 

(4) 

The equation (3) was applied three times for the three 
standard loads, with values of ρk equal to A, B, C and their 
three VNA measurements mk equal to a, b, c, respectively. 
After  that,  the  system  of  three  process  equations  was 
solved for D, M and R  

  D = [abC(A − B) + bcA(B − C) + caB(C − A)]/F  

 

 = ∑ abC(A − B)/F

 = [∏ (A − B)(a − b)]/F2 

with  F ≡ cC(B − A) + aA(C − B) + bB(A − C) 

 

 = ∑ cC(B − A))  

where  ∑  and  ∏  produce  two  more  terms,  from  the  given 
one, by cyclic rotation of the letters a, b, c or A, B, C. The 
determination  of  errors  is  known  as  the  calibration  of  the 
VNA measurement system and the three standards A, B, C 
are called calibration standards. 

These  errors  were  considered  as  dependent  on  the 
variables a, b, c, A, B, C and thus the three process equa-
tions  in  differentials  formed  a  system,  which  was  then 
solved for the three differentials dD, dM and dR  

 dD = [∏ (a − b) ∑ (B − C)BCdA +

The  developed  expressions  (9)-(11)  are  the  total  dif-
ferential  errors  for  the  system  errors  D,  M,  and  R.  These 
expressions  were  mechanically  verified  using  a  developed 
software program for symbolic computations.  

Notably,  using  manufacturer's  data  for  standard  load 
uncertainties  and  VNA  measurement  inaccuracies,  the 
characterization  of  the  measurement  system  can  be  com-
pleted  by  considering  dD,  dM  and  dR  in  terms  of  fre-
quency and, perhaps, we can call the set of them "the dif-
ferential error core of the measurement system".  

The total differential error of ρ was then expressed by 

  dρ = [−RdD − (m − D)2dM − (m − D)dR + Rdm] 

 

 / [M(m − D) + R]2 

(12) 

which was considered dependent, through dD, dM and dR, 
on L = 7 independent variables m, mk  (a, b, c), ρk (A, B, C) 
and  on  their  L  =  7  independent  differentials  dm,  dmk  (da, 
db, dc), dρk (dA, dB, dC). 

To make possible a precise comparison between vari-
ous complex differential errors, geometric notions were in-
troduced below.  

Since  Z0  is  real,  (1)  is  a  transformation  of  the  close 
right half plane to the closed unit circle [6]. Therefore, if |ρ| 
=  1,  care  must  be  exercised  to  restrict  its  differential  into 
the  unit  circle.  The  VNA  measurements  have  a  specific 
bounded range for their modulus away from the origin Ο of 
the  complex  plane,  so  that  the  domain  of  each  measure-
ment is a bounded circular annular with its centre at the Ο.  

Uncertainty  and  inaccuracy  data  outline  regions  for 
each dρ and its dm. If z = |z|ejy stands for any of the inde-
pendent variables and dz = ejy(d|z| + j|z|dy) for its differen-
tial  (where  d|z|  and  dy  in  dz  polar  form  are  independent 
real  differentials  with  values  in  given  intervals)  then  the 
corresponding  contribution  to  dρ  is  a  summation  term 
Wdz, with factor W = |W|ejV, so that 

Wdz = |W|ej(V + y)d|z| + |W|ej(V + y + π/2)|z|dy 

(13) 

W is in fact a known value of the respective partial deriva-
tive. Each expression Wdz outlines a contour for a partial z 
Differential Error Region (z DER) around O. If z ≠ 0, the 
partial DER is a parallelogram with perpendicular sides d|z| 
and  |z|dy,  initially  parallel  to  the  rectangular  coordinate 
axes Re{z} and Im{z}, stretched or contracted by |W| and 
rotated by (V + y) around Ο. If z = ρ = 0 then dz = ejyd|z|, 
with 0 ≤ d|z| and indeterminate y, so that the corresponding 
partial DER is a circle with radius |W|d|z|. 

Accordingly, a total DER is the sum of either L paral-
lelograms  or  (L  −  1)  parallelograms  and  1  circle.  DER  is 
then  a  convex  set  with  contour:  either  a  polygonal  line  of 
4L line segments and vertices, at most or a piecewise curve 
composed of 4(L − 1) line segments, 4(L − 1) circular arcs 
and 8(L − 1) vertices, at most. Some vertices may coincide.  

Differential Error Intervals DEIs were defined by the 
greatest lower and least upper differential error bounds for 
the real and imaginary parts of dρ. DEIs are the projections 
of  a  DER  on  the  rectangular  coordinate  axes.  In  other 
words,  DEIs  are  the  sides  of  the  approximate  upright  rec-
tangle which is circumscribed to a given exact DER.  

On  the  occasion:  On  the  one  hand,  the  commonly 
used approximation, mentioned in 1(a), is related to the ex-
act maximum modulus of the differential error |dρ|, which 
in  fact  is  the  radius  of  the  circle  that  circumscribes  the  ρ 
DER with center at ρ. On the other hand, the partial devia-
tions, mentioned in 1(b), cannot be generalized to outline a 
total ρ DER. 

To  study  the  influence  of  both  inaccuracies  and  un-
certainties  on  ρ  differential  error,  we  considered  a  rear-
rangement  of  the  terms  in  dρ.  The  four  inaccuracy  terms 
corresponding to dm, dmk were defined as the di sum, and 
the three uncertainty terms corresponding to dρk, as the du 
sum. After that, dρ was considered as a sum of two parts 

  dρ = di + du  

These conclusions can be applied to any other physi-
cal  quantity,  differentiably  dependent  on  all,  some  or  just 
one  of  the  above  independent  variables.  Thus,  any  such 
quantity has an L-term DER, where 7 ≥ L ≥ 1. For exam-
ple, the impedance Z of a DUT has a 7-term DER through  

  dZ = 2Z0dρ/(1 − ρ)2 = ζdρ 

  dZ = ζ(di + du) = dI + dU  

(14) 

(15) 

(16) 

that is a Z DER which results by stretching and rotating dρ 
with ζ = 2Z0/(1 − ρ)2, so that, finally, the Z DER is similar 
to the ρ DER.  

3.  Results 

Although  the  developed  expressions  are  independent 
of the particular measurement system in use, we report, for 
the  sake  of  completeness,  that  measurements  appearing  in 
this paper were made using a type-N, Z0 = 50 Ω measure-
ment system with the following specific devices:  

(i) HP8505A Opt 005PL VNA with (ii) Opt 007 HP8501A 
Storage  Normalizer,  (iii)  HP8660C  Synthesized  Signal 
Generator  with  (iv)  HP86603  RF  Section,  (v)  HP5340A 
Opt 011 frequency counter, (vi) a HP85032A 50 Ω Type-N 
Calibration  Kit,  (vii)  HP85032-60011  Open/Short,  (viii) 
HP 8502 Transmission/Reflection Test Set, (ix) HP11501A 
-183  cm RF Cable, and (x) HP-IB IEEE488 82335B/8-bit 
ISA  Interface  Card  under  the  control  of  an  AMD486/66 
PC. 

This  system  operates  from  1  to  1300  MHz  with  100 

Hz PLL stability in CW (non-sweep) frequency mode. 

The  set  of  standards  used  consists  of  a  Short-circuit 
with  ρk=1  =  −1,  a  matching  Load  with  ρk=2  =  0  and  an 

3 

Open-circuit with ρk=3 = +1. These are the commonly SLO 
calibration standards given in Tab. 1.

Substitution of the SLO reflection coefficient values to (5)-

 − [(a − b)(b − c)/(c − a)]dC 

 + [2(a − b)2/(c − a)2]dc]} 

On the occasion, the specific ρk mentioned in 1(b) are the 
SLO  values  that  result  (17)-(22),  which  obviously  cannot 
be  generalized  to  express  total  differential  errors  in  any 
other case.  

Therefore,  as  the  matching  load  ρ  =  0  is  included  in 
any SLO calibration, such a measurement system has a dif-
ferential  error  core  consists  of  a  D  DER  with  4  line  seg-
ments, 4 circular arcs and 8 vertices at most, an R DER and 
M DER with 20 line segments, 20 circular arcs and 40 ver-
tices  at  most.  Consequently,  such  a  system  produces  a  ρ 
DER and a Z DER with 24 line segments, 24 circular arcs 
and 48 vertices at most. 

The considered load uncertainties are given in Tab. 2, 
where in the absence of manufacturers' data for dA and dC, 
both  of  them  were  considered  equal  to  the  uncertainty  of 
the Maury 8810B1 Open-circuit [7].

The  annular  region  for  any  VNA  measurement  is 
specified  from  −100  to  0  db  in  modulus  and  ±180°  in  ar-
gument. Measurements result with a decimal unnormalized 
floating-point  mantissa  of  4  digits,  for  both  modulus  and 
argument.  

It  is  well  known  that  VNA  measurements  are  refer-
enced  to  a  test  connector  (reference  plane),  which  can  be 
either  the  test  port  itself  on  the  Reflection/Transmission 
Test Set [3(viii)] or the far-end connector of a Z0 Transmis-
sion Line [3(ix)], connected to this test port. In either case, 
the error model of the system is still that of Fig. 1, with dif-
ferent error values of course. These two possibilities were 
considered  here  as  two  system  configurations:  System  1 
and System 2. 

A suite of developed software applications:  

(a)  Controls  the  system  and  collects  data  in  terms  of 

frequency, using the IEEE-488 protocol,  

(21) 

(b) Processes the collected data and computes the ver-

tices of DER and the end-points of its DEIs and 

(c)  Sketches  pictures  for  D,  M,  R,  ρ,  Z  and  their 
DERs in terms of frequency steps and makes a film using 
them as frames. 

3.1  System Errors 

(22) 

The measurements of two System configurations were 
processed  in  different  ways  to  demonstrate  the  variety  of 
possible measurement considerations.  

System  1:  Measurements  were  made  from  2  to  1289 
MHz  in  13  MHz  steps.  Each  load  ρk  was  measured  twice 
and the mean value of these measurements was considered 
as mk. The endpoints of inaccuracy intervals dmk were con-
sidered as the two signed values of the absolute half differ-
ence between the two measurements, plus 1/2 of the unit in 
the  last  place  of  the  mantissa,  both  in  modulus  and  argu-
ment. The centre frequency f1 = 639 MHz of the band was 
selected  to  reveal  DER  details.  The  resulting  mk  and  dmk 
are given in Tab. 3.

System  2:  Measurements  were  made  from  600  to 
1000  MHz  in  4  MHz  steps.  Each  load  ρk  was  measured 
once.  Although,  a  detail  scale  of  inaccuracy  in  terms  of 
signal level is available, the measurement inaccuracies dmk 
were  considered  here  as  symmetric  intervals  defined  by  1 
unit in the last place of the corresponding mantissa, both in 
modulus and argument of mk. This emulates any other case 
in  which  there  is  no  further  information,  so  inaccuracy 
must be considered as the least inaccuracy, independent of 
the  four  possible  rounding  methods  (to  nearest,  down,  up 
or towards zero). In other words, this measurement consid-
eration  results  the  differential  error  core  of  the  System  2. 
The  frequency  f2  =  932  MHz  was  selected  to  detail  the 
proposed  method.  The  measurements  and  the  considered 
inaccuracies at f2 are given in Tab. 4.

Tab.  5  contains  the  comparison  of  the  errors  in  the 
two Systems at the selected frequencies. The wide diversity 
between  the  errors  of  System  1  and  System  2  against  the 
frequency results immediately from the comparison of Fig. 
2 with Fig. 4. Fig. 3 shows the error DERs for the two Sys-
tems 1 and 2 at f1 and f2 respectively, with different scaling 
for the two coordinate axes to reveal the details. The con-
tours are outlined with small circles as their vertices. 

Since  the  objective  was  the  uncertainty  of  antenna 
impedance  and  the  related  application  was  studied  using 
System 2, additional example calculations are done at f2 for 
an  appropriately  selected  contour  point,  which  is  marked 
with an arrow on the related DERs below. The rectangular 
form of data for this example is given in Tab. 6.

3.2  An Antenna in contrast with a Resistor 

DUT 1: A typical resistor with a nominal DC imped-
ance  of  50  Ω  ±20%  tolerance  was  soldered  on  a  type-N 
base  connector  and  enclosed  in  an  aluminum  box  to  form 
an EM shielded DUT for reference. 

DUT 2: A typical UHF ground-plane antenna of five 
λ/4  elements  at  900  MHz,  with  apex  angle  90°,  was  built 
by  copper  bare  wire  of  1  mm  diameter  and  its  terminals 
were  soldered  directly  on  a  type-N  connector  of  a  rather 
poor  dielectric  insulation.  Therefore,  it  is,  in  essence,  an 
EM  unshielded  DUT.  The  antenna  was  roughly  installed 
indoors, nearby and outside of an anechoic chamber.  

The antenna was simulated by 96 wire segments. The 
simulation was carried out with a suite of developed visual 
tools supported by a fully analyzed, corrected and redevel-
oped edition of the original thin-wire computer program by 
Richmond  [8]  while  the  connector  was  simulated  sepa-
rately.  

The measurements m and their inaccuracies dm of 50 
Ω DC Resistor at f1 and UHF Ground-Plane Antenna at f2, 
were considered under the mentioned measurement condi-
tions for System 1 and System 2 and they are given in Tab. 
7 and Tab. 8, respectively.

Tab. 8.  UHF Ground-Plane Antenna: Measurement and inaccuracy at f2. 
The values in Tab. 9 complete the example of the se-
lected contour point for UHF Ground-Plane Antenna at f2.  
The  precise  relation  of  the  total  complex  differential 
error  dρ  to  its  complex  differential  error  parts  di  and  du, 
due to all inaccuracies and all uncertainties respectively, is 
illustrated by their DERs in Fig. 5 for the 50 Ω DC Resis-
tor at f1 and in Fig. 6 for the UHF Ground-Plane Antenna 
at f2. 

The illustrations for the uncertainty dZ = dI + dU and 
the calculated exact difference ΔZ for 50 Ω DC Resistor at 
f1 and UHF Ground-Plane Antenna at f2, are shown in Fig. 
7 and Fig. 10, respectively. Numeric evaluation of ΔZ was 
resulted 27x2 points, from L = 7 interval endpoints for dm, 
dmk and dρk, which are dense enough to appear as stripes, 
placed over the Z DER. The computation time for ΔZ cal-
culations exceeds that for Z DER by a factor of about 60. It 
is concluded that almost all ΔZ points belong to Z DER. 

The precise relation of the Z DER to its complex dif-
ferential  error  parts  dI  and  dU,  geometrically  represented 
by  their  DERs,  make  clear  that  measurement  inaccuracies 
are not insignificant in Z uncertainty calculations.

To demonstrate the method, selected DER frames for 
ρ and Z, mentioned at 3(c), are shown, as beads on space-
curved filaments against frequency, in Fig. 8 for 50 Ω DC 
Resistor and Fig. 11 for UHF Ground-Plane Antenna. 

The computed DEIs for the input resistance R and re-
actance X against frequency are shown, in Fig. 9 for 50 Ω 
DC Resistor and Fig. 12 for UHF Ground-Plane Antenna.  

In  Fig.  12,  the  dashed  lines  represent  predicted  val-
ues, for the input impedance Z of UHF Ground-Plane An-
tenna simulation, which are closed enough to the computed 
DEIs. 

In Fig. 13, the ρ DER is compared with the approxi-
mate |ΔS11|. It is concluded that ΔS11 underestimates the un-
certainty of 50 Ω DC Resistor at f1 and overestimates that 
of UHF Ground-Plane Antenna at f2. 

sult  complements  the  one  from  Z  related  DERs  of  Fig.  7 
and Fig. 10, so it is concluded that measurement inaccura-
cies are significant indeed in Z uncertainty calculations.

Hence,  the  proposed  method  may  be  efficiently  used 
in any other case where the process equations (3), (4) and 
the defined DERs and DEIs can find application.

Fig. 13.  Precise comparison between Δρ stripes, ρ-DER and ΔS11 circle. 

To  estimate  roughly  the  separate  contribution  of  all 
inaccuracies and all uncertainties to the differential error of 
ρ  and  Z,  max  values  are  commonly  used.  In  Tab.  10  the 
max values of |dρ|, |di| and |du| are expressed as percentage 
of  |dρ|  from  Fig.  5  and  Fig.  6,  and  of  |ΔS11|  from  Fig.  13. 
Since from (15) and (16) |dZ|, |dI| and |dU| are analogous to 
|dρ|,  |di|  and  |du|  respectively,  the  max  values  of  them  are 
also  given  in  the  same  columns  of  Tab.  10.  Although 
max|dZ| ≤ max|dI| + max|dU|, the particular shape of the ρ 
related DERs, in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, and of their similar Z re-
lated  DERs,  in  Fig.  7  and  Fig.  10,  result  in  max|dZ|  ≅ 
max|dI| + max|dU|, as shown in Tab. 10.

Tab. 10.  Percentage comparison of max differential errors at f1 and f2. 

Tab. 11 contains the results for max values of differ-
ential errors over the whole measurement bands of System 
1  and  System  2.  Great  divergences  of  |ΔS11|  from  dρ  are 
noted. Max|dI| contributes an amount of about 30 ~ 35% of 
max|dZ|  to  the  total  max|dZ|,  under  these  rather  conserva-
tive considerations for the particular applications. This re-

SUMMARY 

release. 

We analyze data from four GPS campaigns carried out between 1997 and 2002 on a network 

of 11 sites in the Suez-Sinai, the area of collision between the African and the Arabian plates. 

This is the key area to understand how and in which way Sinai behaves like a sub-plate of  the 

African  plate  and  the  role  played  between  seismic  and  geodetic  (long  term)  deformation 

Our  analysis  shows  that,  on  average,  the  Suez-Sinai  area  motion  (in  terms  of  ITRF00 

velocities) matches African plate motion (NNR-NUVEL-1A model). 

 However, the baseline length variations show transient deformations in Sinai and across the 

Gulf of Suez, reaching up a maximum value of about 1.5 cm in five years.  

Since  current  geodynamical  models  do  not  predict  significant  tectonic  deformation  in  this 

area, we worked under the hypothesis that a contribute may be due to post-seismic relaxation. 

Under  this  hypothesis,  we  compared  the  baselines  length  variations  with  the  post-seismic 

relaxation field associated with five major local earthquakes occurred in the area, testing two 

different  viscoelastic  models.  Our  results  show  that  the  transient  deformations  are  better 

modelled  for  viscosity  values  of  1018  Pa  s  in  the  lower  crust  and  1020  Pa  s  in  the 

asthenosphere.  

However, since the modelled post-seismic effect results modest and a certain amount of the 

detected deformation is not accounted for, we think that an improved modelling should take 

into account the lateral heterogeneities of crust and upper mantle structures.

1.  INTRODUCTION     

The  interaction  between  the  African  and  the  Arabian  plates  displays  a  unambiguous 

pattern south of the Sinai peninsula where the opening of the Red Sea rift takes place. Sinai 

peninsula is a key area for understanding the role played among the Suez rift, the Aqaba fault 

and the Red Sea rift. Although many authors are discussing the opening of the Suez Gulf, we 

think that the kinematics engine of the Suez area seems much more complicated than a simple 

(though  low)  tensional  tectonics.  This  consideration  comes  out  from  the  fact  that  the 

commonly accepted geodynamical view of the area hardly reconciles with GPS observations 

and recent focal mechanism solutions. Piersanti et al. [2001] recently enhanced the potential 

role  played  by  the  post-seismic  transient  deformation  with  respect  to  the  long-term  tectonic 

deformation.  

From November 1997 to May 2002 four GPS surveys were carried out in the Suez-Sinai 

area on a network of 11 sites (Figure 1), to shed light on its tectonic processes. We reanalyze 

GPS data from the 1997 and 1998 campaigns [Riguzzi et al., 1999] together with new GPS 

data from the 2000 and 2002 campaigns. We present ITRF00 horizontal velocities estimated 

by the GPS time series of each site, after processing the network at regional scale with some 

selected  IGS  sites.  Thereafter,  our  attention  is  focused  on  the  time  series  of  the  baseline 

length variations, since they exhibit significant transient trends different from site to site. In 

the  end,  we  want  to  test  which  could  be  the  contribute  due  to  the  post-seismic  viscoelastic 

relaxation to the detected deformations.  

2.  TECTONIC SETTING 

The  tectonics  of  the  Suez-Sinai  area  is  dominated  by  the  active  boundary  between  the 

African  and  the  Arabian  plates,  which  are separating  one from  the  other  along  the  Red  Sea 

rift.

Geological  and  seismological  studies  evidence  that  the  Sinai  peninsula  behaves  like  a 

sub-plate of the African plate which accommodates the main motion of the Aqaba left-lateral 

transform  fault  (about  8-9  mm/y)  [Le  Pichon  &  Gaulier,  1988]  with  the  supposed  low 

extensional motion of the Suez Gulf (< 1 mm/y) [Steckler et al., 1988; Jackson et al., 1988] in 

the  framework  of  the  Red  Sea  opening  [Ben-Menahem  et  al.,  1976].  The  triple  junction 

among  the  Gulf of Suez rift,  the Aqaba fault  and the  Red  Sea rift  is located south of Sinai. 

Current  geodynamical  models  support  the  idea  that  the  triggered  motion  along  the  Aqaba 

fault has almost entirely replaced the Gulf of Suez opening.  

Recent GPS results show spreading rates along the Red Sea varying from 14±1 mm yr-1 

at 15° N to 5.6±1 mm yr-1 at 27° N, just below the triple junction, and left lateral strike slip 

motion of 5.6±1  mm  yr-1  along  the  southernmost  segment of  the  Aqaba  fault  [McClusky et 

al.,  2003].  A  very  recent  analysis  based  on  continuous  GPS  observation  of  Israeli  network 

shows the left-lateral motion of the Dead Sea fault (a northern segment of the Aqaba fault) at 

a rate of about 2.8 mm yr-1 and a slight spreading of the Suez Gulf [Wdowinski et al., 2004]. 

Seismic activity  mainly occurs along the borders of the Sinai sub-plate, in the southern 

part  of  the  Gulf  of  Suez  and  along  the  Aqaba  fault,  where  it  reaches  the  highest  level 

[Mahmoud,  2003;  Salamon  et  al.,  2003].  The  largest  event  recorded  in  the  area  is  the 

November  22,  1995  (Mw=  7.2),  also  known  as  Aqaba  or  Nuweiba  earthquake.  This  event 

reached a VIII maximum intensity with substantial damage over an area of about 1000 km2 

and was followed by more than 200 aftershocks with Ml≥4.0 [Malkawi et al., 1999].  

From 1997 to 2002 no relevant seismic activity was recorded by the Egyptian National 

Seismic Network in the area under investigation, since local magnitudes never exceeded 4.6.  

3.  DATA PROCESSING 

The  Sinai  data  of  the  four  GPS  campaigns  of  1997,  1998,  2000,  2002  were  analyzed 

using  the  BERNESE  GPS  sw  v.4.2  [Beutler  et  al.,  2001]  together  with  data  from  some 

 

3

selected  IGS  permanent  stations  (Table  1).  We  adopted  the  same  processing  procedure  for 

each campaign, using IGS precise ephemeredes and following the recommended strategy for 

regional campaigns. The coordinates and covariance matrices pertaining to each session were 

adjusted in a final campaign solution by the software NETGPS [Crespi & Riguzzi, 1998]. The 

adjustment was performed constraining within their rms the ITRF00 coordinates of the IGS 

sites  at  the  mean  epoch  of  each  campaign.  Table  2  shows  the  estimated  and  threshold  χ2 

values  testing  the  correctness  of  the  normal  variate  observation;  the  test  is  passed  by  an 

iterative procedure when the estimated χ2 results less than the threshold value. In Table 2 are 

also  reported  the  precision  of  the  four  adjustments  in  terms  of  mean  rms  computed  at  95% 

confidence level.  

The horizontal velocity components (Table 1) were estimated by linear fits to time series 

(Figure 2). Although currently used, this is not a rigorous way to estimate velocities because 

it assumes a simplified stochastic model by neglecting spatial correlations among sites; while 

the  fact  that  we  have  few  observations  allow  us  to  exclude  temporal  correlations,  thanks  to 

the time lag among observations [Barzaghi et al., 2004].  

In terms of global kinematics, our data show that, on average, the Suez-Sinai area motion 

(ITRF00  velocities)  matches  the  African  plate  motion  defined  by  the  NNR-NUVEL-1A 

model [De Mets et al., 1994], even if space geodetic rates result on average slower than those 

predicted by about 7% (Figure 3).  

the Suez Gulf.  

The motion is generally linear in time, except for the sites located on the Sinai shore of 

Subsequently,  we  focus  our  attention  on  local  Suez-Sinai  kinematics,  considering  GPS 

baselines  obtained  after  each  campaign  adjustment  together  with  their  errors  at  95% 

confidence level. We selected baselines stemming from GEMS (Table 3), the central site of 

the  African  shore  having  more  GPS  survey  repetitions  and  the  best  fit  to  ITRF00  linear

motion (Table 1, Figure 2). Baseline lengths range about from 28 to 134 km with rms never 

exceeding 3 mm.  

Figure 4 shows the time trend of baseline length variations (Table 3) with respect to the 

first epoch values. All the variations range within ±0.5 cm along the Suez African shore and ± 

1.5 cm across the Gulf. It is noteworthy that the detected variations exhibit a larger magnitude 

(about  10-7)  with  respect  to  the  annual  scale  effect  (about  10-8)  recognized  in  time  series  of 

baseline  lengths  between  IGS  stations  [Pietrantonio,  2002].  Consequently,  we  want  to 

investigate which could be the contribute of post-seismic relaxation to the significant baseline 

length variations.  

4.  POST-SEISMIC RELAXATION MODELS  

Previous  works,  based  on  smaller  and  less  refined  dataset  [Piersanti  et  al.,  2001], 

evidenced the possible role played by post-seismic viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust 

and  asthenosphere  in  assessing  the  detected  deformation  field.  At  this  aim,  Piersanti  et  al. 

[2001]  computed  the  post-seismic  deformation  field  associated  with  the  1995  Aqaba 

earthquake,  the  major  event  in  that  area  in  the  last  decades.  Here,  we  repeated  the  analysis 

presented  in  the  cited  work  but  since  our  dataset  contains  now  much  more  information,  we 

introduced  in  our  simulations  also  the  effects  of  5  other  significant  events  occurred  in  that 

area in 1993 (MW = 6.1 and 5.7)  1995  (MW = 5.3)  1996 (MW = 5.3) and 2000 (ML = 4.6), see 

Table  4.  We  used  the  CMT  solutions  for  the  source  focal  parameters  [Dziewonski  et  al., 

1997],  while  for  the  epicentral  locations  we  prefer  to  use  more  precise  data  coming  from  a 

local seismic network [Salomon et al., 2003]. 

We  remind  that  our  model  of  post-seismic  deformation  takes  into  account  the  effects  of 

spherical  geometry  self  gravitation,  linear  viscoelastic  rheology  of  the  asthenosphere  and 

lower crust, physical and chemical discontinuity between the elastic shallow layer (crust) and 

the two viscoelastic layers (lower crust and asthenosphere) [Piersanti et al., 1995; 1997]. The 

 

5

adoption  of  a  spherical  model  is  likely  to  be  not  meaningless,  since  the  area  under 

examination has a linear extension of some hundreds of km (see Nostro et al., [1999]). The 

solution  is  retrieved  semi-analytically,  through  a  spherical  harmonic  decomposition  of  the 

physical  observables.  The  reader  is  referred  to  the  previously  cited  works  for  a  detailed 

description of the model implementation and solution method. Piersanti et al. [2001] tested 6 

different layerings. Since two of them (model 2 and 3 from table 1 of Piersanti et al., 2001) 

furnished sensibly better results than the others, in the present simulations we used these two 

particular  profiles.  They  are  composed  by  an  elastic  crust  (thickness  15  and  20  km 

respectively),  a  viscoelastic  lower  crust  (thickness  15  km,  viscosity  1018  Pa  s)  and  a 

viscoelastic  asthenosphere  (thickness  170  and  165  km,  viscosity  1018  and  1020  Pa  s, 

respectively).  

Figure  4  shows  the  time  series  of  GPS  baseline  length  variations  vs.  the  post-seismic 

relaxation  models 2 and 3. The variations predicted in 5 years range between -2 cm and +1 

cm,  except  for  the  baseline  GEMS-CATH,  where  the  predicted  contraction  reaches  the 

highest level.  It has to be underlined that the model curves of Figure 4 are not retrieved by 

inversion but by forward-type modelling, so they do not represent any fit of data, but refer to 

a completely independent data set (from seismology).  

With the aim of evaluating which model agrees better with the GPS baseline variations, we 

performed  a  Fisher  test  (Koch,1988).  The  F  experimental  value  is

24.3=Fe

while  the 

theoretical  is

F 28,28

46.2=

  at  99%  significance  level,  therefore  the  models  are  not  equivalent. 

From statistics we should prefer model 3, since the mean deviations are the smallest.  

In our opinion, though it is noteworthy that GPS and post-seismic derived deformations are 

comparable  in  magnitude  (mean  deviations  are  within  1  cm)  and  time  trend,  on  the  other 

hand,  the  comparison  among  relaxation  models  adequacy  to  the  data  and  that  of  the  no-

change model shows that the contribute due to relaxation is small (see Table 5).

5.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The utility of GPS to detect crustal deformations is widely recognized, so that permanent GPS 

arrays  are  currently  used  for  this  purpose  all  over  the  world.  Anyway,  non-permanent 

networks play important roles in control surveys, where establishing permanent GPS arrays is 

too expensive besides logistically and politically hard. 

Taking into account what stated above, we have analyzed GPS data coming from four surveys 

on a non-permanent network of 11 sites in the Suez-Sinai area, carried out from 1997 to 2002.  

The main conclusions of our analysis, focused on ITRF00 site velocities and baseline length 

variations across the Suez channel, are  

1) the estimated ITRF00 GPS velocities are consistent with those predicted by the NNR-

NUVEL-1A, though smaller by about 7%. This implies that, on average, the Sinai-Suez area 

matches the African plate motion defined by  NNR-NUVEL-1A and the extension in the Suez 

Gulf results at present not active. Consequently, GPS data do not allow us to distinguish Sinai 

as sub-plate of the African plate and most of the motion would concern Arabia with respect to 

Africa, in agreement with Sella et al. [2002] and McClusky et al. [2003]. The hypothesized 

deceleration of the African plate enhanced by Sella et al. [2002], McClusky et al. [2003] and 

Calais  et  al.  [2003]  is  here  supported  by  the  detected  difference  between  GPS  and  NNR-

NUVEL-1A velocities, though near the significance level; 

2)  the  significant  transient  trend  of  the  baseline  length  variations  across  the  Suez  Gulf 

exhibits  in  our  opinion  a  possible  signature  of  seismic  origin  in  terms  of  post-seismic 

viscoelastic relaxation, in agreement with the role enhanced by Piersanti et al. [2001]; under 

this hypothesis the assessed transient deformations are better modelled for viscosity values of 

1018 Pa s in the lower crust and 1020 Pa s in the asthenosphere.  

7

Anyway, we showed that the post-seismic contribute given by our models is not so large 

if  compared  with  the  no-change  model  (Table  5).  The  detected  discrepancies  between  the 

post-seismic  predicted  and  the  GPS  observed  deformations  could  be  due  to  the  model 

assumption  of    lateral  homogeneity of  the  medium,  in spite  of  the complex  tectonics  of  the 

area.  Even  if  the  knowledge  of  the  crustal  and  upper  mantle  structure  of  the  region  is  very 

limited, the Gulf of Suez rift would display sharp lateral heterogeneities between continental 

and oceanic crust (Steckler, 1985; Steckler et al., 1998). Under this light should be considered 

the largest deviations exhibited by CATH, the highest site (1350 m above s. l.) located in the 

thicker continental crust of Sinai. 

We believe that in the next future new perspectives on the geodynamics of the Suez-Sinai 

area will be opened by combining all the existing GPS solutions across and around this area 

and improving local crustal models with lateral heterogeneities.

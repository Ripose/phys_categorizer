We  address  the  formation  and  propagation  of  multi-spot  soliton  packets  in  saturable 

Kerr  nonlinear  media  with  an  imprinted  harmonic  transverse  modulation  of  the 

refractive  index.  We  show  that,  in  sharp  contrast  to  homogeneous  media  where  stable 

multi-peaked  solitons  do  not  exist,  the  photonic  lattices  support  stable  higher-order 

structures in the form of soliton packets, or soliton trains. Intuitively, such trains can be 

viewed as made of several lowest order solitons bound together with appropriate relative 

phases  and  their  existence  as  stable  objects  puts  forward  the  concept  of  compact 

manipulation of several solitons as a single entity.

Wave  propagation  in  nonlinear  media  whose  properties  vary  periodically  along 

the  transverse  direction  exhibits  a  wealth  of  new  features  including  a  possibility  of 

lattice  soliton  formation.  In  strongly  guiding  and  evanescently  coupled  nonlinear 

waveguide arrays the formation of discrete solitons [1,2] is possible, that have attracted 

great  attention  because  of  their  potential  for  all-optical  switching  and  routing.  In  this 

context  the  intermediate  regime  constituted  by  continuous  nonlinear  media  with  an 

imprinted  transverse  modulation  of  the  refractive  index  offers  a  variety  of  new 

opportunities.  The  concept  behind  such  regime  might  be  termed  tunable  discreteness, 

with  the  strength  of  modulation  being  the  parameter  that  tunes  the  system  properties 

from those expected for systems modeled by continuous equations, to those exhibited by 

systems  modeled  with  discrete  evolution  equations  [3,4].  Recently  lattice  solitons  were 

studied in arrays of optically induced waveguides in photorefractive crystals [5-13]. Basic 

properties of lowest order lattice solitons are well understood. Some examples of higher-

order multi-humped lattice solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates or Kerr optical media 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  found  in  Refs  [14,15].  However,  the  existence  and  rigorous  stability  analysis  of 

complex  lattice  soliton  states,  in  the  form  of  soliton  packets,  in  saturable  media  is  an 

open problem. 

In  this  paper  we  report  the  results  of  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  properties  and 

dynamical  stability  of  different  families  of  one-dimensional  lattice  solitons  in  both 

focusing and defocusing saturable optical medium with harmonic transverse modulation 

of linear refractive index. Stability analysis reveals the existence of stability regions for 

even  solitons  that  broaden  with  increase  of  degree  of  saturation  of  nonlinear  response. 

We discovered existence of stable multi-soliton structures in the form of solitons packets, 

or  soliton  trains,  that  are  analogous  to  twisted  strongly  localized  modes  of  discrete 

systems. Intuitively, such packets can be built from an arbitrary number of lowest order 

odd solitons, or soliton bits, with appropriately engineered phases. No examples of such 

structures  are  known  in  uniform  media,  thus  the  photonic  lattice  uniquely  affords  the 

results reported here. 

We consider light beam propagation along 

z

 axis of a saturable medium with a 

periodic modulation of the linear refractive index in 

x

 direction. We use a mathematical 

model set by the inhomogeneous saturable nonlinear Schrödinger equation:

contribution  to  refractive  index.  Note  that  Eq.  (1)  admits  several  conserved  quantities

Families  of  stationary  solutions  were  obtained  by  solving  Eq.  (1)  with  a  relaxation 

algorithm.  Standard  linearization  procedure  was  used  to  analyze  soliton  stability  and 

obtain perturbation growth rates  δ . 

For  focusing  nonlinearity  optical  lattices  support  two  types  of  lowest  order 

solitons: odd an even (Fig. 1). Maximum of odd soliton coincides with the maximum of 

( )R η

( )η
  (Fig.  1(c)),  while  even  one  is  centered  between  neighboring  maximums  of  R  

(Fig. 1(d)). Dispersion curves U b  for odd and even solitons almost coincide (Fig. 1(a)). 

( )

There  are  lower  and  upper  cutoffs  on  propagation  constant  for  both  odd  and  even 

solitons. Lattice solitons transform into Bloch waves in both cutoffs. Lower cutoff b

 is 

low

the  monotonically  growing  function  of 

p

  (Fig.  1(b)),  while  upper  cutoff  is  given  by

S

.  The  segment  of  existence  on  b   shrinks  with  growth  of  saturation 

parameter S  for both odd and even lattice solitons. 

Linear  stability  analysis  revealed  existence  of  instability  areas  for  odd  lattice 

solitons associated with real perturbation growth rates near the upper cutoff (Fig. 2(a)). 

The  width  of  instability  areas  decreases  as  b

uppb→

  and  as  S

0→

.  Growth  of  guiding 

parameter 

p

 results in decrease of instability areas width. We revealed that nonlinearity 

saturation  stabilizes  even  lattice  solitons  that  are  unstable  in  discrete  systems  [1,2]. 

Notice  that  instability  areas  for  odd  solitons  and  stability  areas  for  even  ones  coincide 

(Figs.  2(a)  and  2(b)).  Stable  propagation  of  odd  and  even  solitons  perturbed  by  white 

noise is illustrated in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). 

Next  we  address  properties  of  twisted  lattice  solitons  (Fig.  3).  In  such  solutions, 

the function w

( )η

 changes its sign between neighboring maxima of the lattice (Fig. 3(c)), 

 

 

so intuitively they can be viewed as nonlinear superposition of several odd solitons with 

appropriately  engineered  phases.  Fig.  3(a)  shows  the  corresponding  dispersion  curves. 

The range of existence on propagation constant decreases with growth of twisted soliton 

order.  Lower  and  upper  cutoffs  for  lowest  order  (or  first)  twisted  soliton  are  shown  in 

Fig.  3(b).  The  area  of  existence  shrinks  with  growth  of  saturation  parameter  and 

broadens  with  increase  of  guiding  parameter.  Stability  analysis  revealed  that  first 

twisted  soliton  becomes  stable  over  certain  threshold  value  of  energy  flow  (Fig.  3(d)). 

Notice that the structure of shaded area in Fig. 3(d) is complex, with separate “stability 

windows”, but we do not show them here. Also there exist instability band near upper 

cutoff that is narrow and not seen in the plot. 

The central result of this paper is that stabilization takes place for twisted solitons 

of  arbitrary  higher  order,  above  a  certain  threshold  energy  level.  Figures  3(e)  and  3(f) 

show the profile and the stable propagation of higher order twisted soliton perturbed by 

broadband noise. Since twisted solitons can be intuitively seen as nonlinear superposition 

of  several  odd  solitons  with  opposite  phases,  this  result  implies  that  “multi-soliton 

trains”  can  be  built  out  of  several  individual  solitons.  We  found  that  the  threshold 

energy flow for stabilization slowly increases with growth of soliton order (i.e., with the 

number  of  spots  in  the  soliton  packet).  On  physical  grounds,  the  stabilization  of  such 

higher-order  soliton  trains  can  be  understood  as  follows.  Because  of  the  alternating 

phases of neighboring lowest-order spots involved into the packets, the interaction forces 

acting between them are repulsive, so such higher-order soliton complexes cannot exist 

as  the  stable  objects  in  uniform  media.  The  periodic  potential  set  by  the  lattices 

compensates such repulsive forces, thus enabling stable propagation. 

As pointed out above, the lattice strength is one of the key parameters for control 

of  soliton  properties.  For  example,  in  the  presence  of  the  periodic  refractive  index 

modulation,  at  a  given  energy  level,  the  field  amplitude  necessary  for  soliton-like 

propagation  amounts  to  lower  values  than  that  in  homogeneous  focusing  media. 

Therefore,  at  fixed  energy  level  solitons  in  lattices  with  higher  values  of 

p

  feature 

broader,  more  extended  shape.  This  in  turn  reduces  nonlinearity  saturation  at  the 

soliton  peak  and  thus  broadens  the  energy  interval  where  single  solitons  and  soliton 

trains  exist  (inset  in  Fig.  3(b)).  Thus,  the  energy  level  necessary  to  form  long  soliton 

trains can be substantially reduced by increase of the lattice depth. 

 

Another  example  of  the  importance  of  the  lattice  strength  for  control  of  soliton 

features  is  illustrated  by  removing  the  lattice  and  letting  the  train  to  split  or  unpack. 

Such  splitting  produces  sets  of  diverging  solitons  with  controllable  escape  angles  (Fig. 

4(a) and 4(b)). The higher is the number of solitons in the train the faster is the train 

splitting. We calculated escape angles for solitons that appear upon decay of the soliton 

trains and here we show results for the simplest train. Increasing the overall energy flow 

of the train (Fig. 4(c)) causes the escape angle to decrease first, because of decrease of 

tails  overlap  for  neighboring  spots  in  the  train,  but  then  angle  start  to  grow,  because 

nonlinearity  saturation  tend  to  increase  widths  of  spots  located  in  neighboring  lattice 

sites and, hence, the interaction forces between them. Increase of the transverse extent 

of spots forming the train with growth of 

p

 at fixed overall energy flow (Fig. 4(d)) also 

causes faster train splitting. This is one of manifestation of unique features afforded by 

tunability of the lattice depth that is not possible in fully discrete systems. Notice that 

the  splitting  of  multi-humped  solitons  into  sets  of  diverging  fundamental  solitons 

mediated by instability was also reported in uniform quadratic media [16]. 

Lattices  with  defocusing  nonlinearity  also  support  localized  self-sustained  light 

beams  (Fig.  5).  They  are  typically  wider  than  solitons  in  focusing  lattice  and  have 

several  amplitude  oscillations  (Fig.  5(c)).  Intuitively  they  can  be  viewed  as  a  result  of 

coupling  of  fundamental  modes  guided  by  separate  lattice  sites.  Inside  each  site 

diffraction  and  defocusing  nonlinearity  are  compensated  by 

linear  refraction. 

Fundamental  modes  forming  odd  soliton  are  out-of-phase,  while  for  even  solitons  they 

are  in-phase  (Fig.  5(c)  and  5(e)).  Dispersion  curve U b   is  shown  in  Fig.  5(a)  for  odd 

( )

soliton. Lower and upper cutoffs are presented in Fig. 5(b). We have found that for odd 

solitons  the  multiple  instability  bands  appear  near  lower  cutoff,  while  close  to  upper 

cutoff  odd  solitons  are  stable.  Propagation  of  perturbed  odd  soliton  is  shown  in  Fig. 

5(d). The important result is that defocusing lattices also support stable even solitons of 

different orders. Such solitons conserve their input structure up to the several thousands 

of  diffraction  lengths  in  the  presence  of  white  noise  (Fig.  5(f)).  Notice  that  twisted 

solitons  in  defocusing  lattices  are  exponentially  unstable  in  the  entire  domain  of  their 

In  conclusion,  we  analyzed  properties  of  lattice  solitons  in  Kerr-type  saturable 

medium with harmonic transverse modulation of the linear refractive index, and revealed 

existence. 

 

that  besides  the  simplest  stable  odd  solitons,  such  lattices  support  stable  even  and 

twisted  solitons  that  form  the  trains.  Such  multi-spot  soliton  states  can  be  viewed  as 

nonlinear  superposition  of  several  solitons  stuck  together  into  stable  packets,  and  thus 

open the possibility of the compact manipulation of several solitons as a single state.

Abstract

We report the slowing of a supersonic beam by elastic reﬂection from a receding atomic mirror.

We use a pulsed supersonic nozzle to generate a 511 ± 9 m/s beam of helium that we slow by

reﬂection from a Si(111)-H(1x1) crystal placed on the tip of a spinning rotor. We were able to

reduce the velocity of helium by 246 m/s and show that the temperature of the slowed beam is

lower than 250 mK in the co-moving frame.

Atomic and molecular beams have been a fundamental tool of physical chemistry for many

years, with wide applications in the study of gas dynamics and surface interactions [1, 2].

In recent years, they have also been used as the source for atom optics experiments with

potential applications in atom lithography and atomic interferometry as well as fundamental

physics and precision tests [3]. The highest brightness atomic or molecular beam is formed

when gas escapes from a high pressure source through an aperture that is large compared to

the mean-free-path in the gas. The remarkable result known as a supersonic beam combines

intensities of 1023 atoms/sr/s with beam temperatures of 50 mK in the moving beam frame.

The main limitation of the supersonic beams is that the mean velocity in the laboratory

frame is quite high which has meant decreased sensitivity and energy range for surface scat-

tering experiments, and greater diﬃculties controlling the beam in atom optics experiments.

Experimental realizations of slow supersonic beams include work done by Gupta and Her-

schbach [4]. They controlled the beam velocity by mounting a continuous ﬂow supersonic

valve on the tip of a rotor. Bethlem et al. showed slowing of polar molecules using pulsed

electric ﬁelds [5]. Optical pulsed ﬁelds have been used for slowing as was demonstrated by

Fulton et al. [6]. A method to stop molecules was also demonstrated by Elioﬀ et. al. where

two crossed beams produced cold NO molecules by billiard like collisions [7].

Motivated by the success of the neutron beam paddle [8] we have built an atomic paddle

that reduces the mean velocity of the supersonic beam by specularly reﬂecting the atoms

from an atomic mirror moving in the beam direction. Supersonic beam velocities typically

range from 250 m/s to several kilometers/s depending on the temperature and make-up

of the gas.

In the idealized case of normal reﬂection from a linearly moving crystal, the

reﬂected velocity will be changed by twice the velocity of the mirror. Speciﬁcally, we see
that vf = −va + 2vc, where va is the initial velocity of the gas, vf is the ﬁnal velocity, and

vc is the crystal velocity. From this, it is clear that mirror velocities in excess of 100 m/s are

desirable, which can be achieved using rotary motion.

It is well known that helium reﬂects from single crystal surfaces and helium diﬀraction was

ﬁrst used by Stern and Estermann in 1930 to measure the Maxwellian velocity distribution

[9]. Recently, Allison et. al. were even able to focus a supersonic beam of helium using

reﬂection from a curved hydrogen-passivated Si (111) wafer [10, 11]. To elaborate on the

important point of helium reﬂection probability we consider helium atoms impinging on the

surface of a stationary single-crystal material. The fraction of atoms that undergo elastic

Here m is the mass of the impinging atom, M is the mass of the atom in the crystal, TS

is the temperature of the crystal, E0z is the incident energy, and θS is the crystal Debye
temperature [12, 13]. For example, consider 4He impinging on a single-crystal 28Si with

incident velocity of 550 m/s. The Debye temperature in this case is 690 K, and even for

room temperature crystals we ﬁnd reﬂection probabilities above 25%. Allison et. al. have

measured a specular reﬂection probability of 3% for a Helium beam at a normal velocity

of 900 m/s [14]. This number is consistent with the Debye-Waller prediction for elastic

reﬂection, as the ﬂux was distributed among over 40 diﬀraction channels. Note that in our

experiment, the impact velocity in the frame of the moving crystal is lower than the initial

velocity of the supersonic beam, which helps to increase the elastic reﬂection probability

even more.

spectrometer (QMS).

A schematic ﬁgure of our experimental setup is presented in Fig. 1. Our pulsed supersonic

valve generates an atomic beam that is collimated by a single skimmer. The collimated

beam reﬂects from a spinning rotor and the slow beam is detected by a quadrupole mass

Our atomic beam source has been developed by Even and Lavie [15, 16] and further

optimized to ﬁt our experiment [17]. The trumpet shaped nozzle creates a supersonic beam

of pure helium that is very directional (half-angle of seven degrees) and very monochromatic

(less than 1 percent relative spread in velocity). It combines pulse durations as short as

10 µs FWHM (repetition rate up to 40 Hz) with cryogenic operation. The valve can operate

at up to 100 atmospheres backing pressure. As a result of these features, we are able to time

the valve so that we only ”ﬁre” when the crystals are aligned with the incoming beam and

so no atomic ﬂux is wasted between the pulses, which would raise the background pressure

and possibly attenuate the beam. Two compact 300 l/s turbomolecular pumps maintain a
pressure of 10−7 Torr in the source chamber.

Collimated by a 5 mm skimmer, the supersonic beam then enters the rotor chamber,
which is kept at a pressure of 10−8 Torr by a 500 l/s turbomolecular pump. The chamber

contains a 50.4 cm radius titanium rotor coupled to a motor via a ferroﬂuidic feedthrough

that can operate at up to 10,000 RPM. The rotation rate is servo-controlled to within a few

thousandths of one Hertz of the desired rotation rate. We synchronize the supersonic beam

arrival time with the rotor position using a pulse generated by the rotary motion encoder

that has an angular resolution better than 1 mrad.

Rotary motion, though, creates an unwanted fanning eﬀect. Due to a ﬁnite nozzle opening

time, the temporal extent of our atomic beam arriving at the spinning mirror is about 115µs.

Over this period of time the angle of the reﬂecting mirror changes in proportion to the

angular velocity, and the reﬂected atomic beam is spread in the rotation plane. We use a

large diameter rotor because it allows lower rotation rates, helping to reduce the fanning

eﬀect. However, the tensile stress induced by centrifugal forces sets a safety limit on the

rotor length. In our case the tensile stress is 4 times lower than the yield tensile strength

for the titanium alloy used, as was conﬁrmed by ﬁnite element analysis.

Two 9 mm diameter Si(111)-H(1x1) atom mirrors are mounted in the crystal holders at

the ends of the rotor. The crystals are prepared ex-situ by wet etching a silicon wafer in 40%

arrival time [ms]

FIG. 2: This plot shows the direct helium beam (right peak) and the beam reﬂected from the

still rotor (left peak). The reﬂected beam arrives sooner because the distance the beam travels is

less than for the direct beam. Our calculations show that both beams have the same speed and

temperature. We cannot compare the amplitudes of these beams, as the data was taken using

diﬀerent instruments, and the detectors were mounted in diﬀerent conﬁgurations.

ammonium ﬂuoride. This process removes the native oxide layer and the dangling silicon

bonds are passivated with hydrogen [18]. We routinely verify the surface preparation quality

using an atomic force microscope.

We detect the helium beam using two QMSs equipped with an electron multiplier output

[19]. The short pulse duration allows us to make time-of-ﬂight measurements for both the

direct and the reﬂected beams.

In Fig. 2 we present the time-of-ﬂight measurement for the direct and reﬂected atomic

beams. We use a 48:52 mixture of helium and neon cooled to 77 K. Seeding helium with

a heavier atom helps us to reduce the initial velocity of the incoming supersonic beam. As

one can see, the initial 10 µs long gas pulse spreads to 200 µs after traveling 1.42 m to the

detector. The pulse dispersion is the direct consequence of the ﬁnite beam temperature. We

extract the arrival time and the distribution width from the time-of-ﬂight data and evaluate
the mean velocity of the beam, va = 511 ± 9 m/s, and the most probable velocity in the

arrival time [ms]

FIG. 3: The QMS signal of the helium beam reﬂected from the spinning rotor for diﬀerent crystal

velocities (vc). The later arrival time corresponds to a slower beam. The lower amplitude of the

signal for higher rotor velocities is due to the fanning eﬀect, and agrees with our simulations. These

curves are averages over 50 data sets, and this artiﬁcially broadens the peaks as they are averages

over sharp peaks with varying arrival time due to a jitter in rotor trigger position.

the beam speed ratio which is the ratio of the mean to the most probable velocities [2]. In

In order to measure the reﬂected beam signal, we align the rotor 5◦ degrees oﬀ the

perpendicular position with respect to the incoming atomic beam (as shown in Fig. 1). As

one can see in Fig. 2 the arrival time and distribution width become smaller due to the

shorter 1.11m travelling distance from the valve to the reﬂected beam detector. Importantly,
the temperature of the reﬂected beam is 254 ± 41 mK. This result conﬁrms our expectation

that the specular reﬂection does not signiﬁcantly change the velocity distribution of the

reﬂected beam.

We present time-of-ﬂight data of the beam reﬂected from the moving mirror in Fig. 3. As

one can see, the reﬂected beam arrival time is delayed with increasing mirror linear velocity.

FIG. 4: The calculated velocity of the slowed beam, plotted against the velocity of the crystal.

The rotor fanning eﬀect reduces the intensity of the reﬂected slow beam in quantitative

agreement with our simulations. The beam slowing results are summarized in Fig. 4 where

we present the mean velocity of the reﬂected beam as a function of the crystal linear velocity.

We are able to subtract up to 246 m/s from the initial velocity of the incoming beam.

Note that we can also accelerate the supersonic beam by reversing the rotation direction.

Currently, we are able to remove 246 m/s from the initial beam velocity since we are limited

to a maximal rotation frequency of 42 Hz. Further improvements in rotor design (increased

shaft torsional stiﬀness) should enable us to at least double this number.

Increasing the rotor diameter is not the only way to compensate for the ﬂux loss due

to the fanning eﬀect. In our Monte Carlo beam simulations [17] we have investigated the

possibility of using a deformed crystal surface as a concave atomic focusing mirror. We have

seen that the focusing increases our predicted ﬂux values by an order of magnitude. For a

pure helium beam we expect ﬂuxes of 1013 atoms/s at velocity of 300 m/s. We believe that

we will be able to reach this number after redesigning the rotor and using a pure helium with

higher backing pressures. Overall, our design improves on a previous simulation by Doak et.

al. [20] by several orders of magnitude. Another advantage of the focusing element is that

by reducing the beam spot size we should be able to increase the beam density by a factor of

30. That would allow for more eﬃcient trapping of atoms or light molecules (provided that

we can slow them to suﬃciently low velocities) in an optical dipole trap. Note that due to a

very short valve opening time as compared to the slow beam propagation time, we expect to

have a very high correlation between atom arrival time and velocity. For a beam at 50 m/s

allowed to propagate 1 m from the rotor and assuming a timing resolution of 1 ms, we expect

better than 2 µeV energy resolution. Since our beam is not perfectly monochromatic, this

would allow us to obtain a high resolution atom-surface interaction spectrum with a single

“shot”.

We expect to show in the near future slowing of beams composed of light molecules

such as H2, D2 and CH4. We shall investigate both atomic and molecular interactions with

crystal surfaces at previously unavailable energy ranges with higher resolutions than current

techniques allow. As another future application of our slowing method, we would like to

mention the possibility of suﬃciently slowing helium atoms or light molecules such that they

can be trapped in a optical dipole trap for precision spectroscopy.

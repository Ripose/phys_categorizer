We consider parametric amplification of two-dimensional spatial soliton swinging 

in longitudinally modulated harmonic and Bessel lattices in Kerr-type saturable medium. 

We show that soliton center oscillations along different axes in two-dimensional lattices 

are coupled, which give rise to a number of interesting propagation scenarios including 

periodic damping and excitation of soliton oscillations along perpendicular axes, selective 

amplification of soliton swinging along one of transverse axes and enhancement of soliton 

spiraling.

Solitons in optically induced lattices were predicted and experimentally observed 

in photorefractive crystals in one and two transverse dimensions [1-4]. In photorefractive 

materials  harmonic  lattices  are  usually  formed  by  the  interference  pattern  of  several 

plane waves whose intensity and intersection angles define the lattice depth and period. 

Such  kind  of  lattices  may  be  used  for  engineering  of  systems  with  tunable  discreteness 

since they can operate in both regimes of weak and strong coupling between neighboring 

sites depending on the depth and period of refractive index modulation. Analogously to 

their  discrete  counterparts  [5]  lattice  solitons  can  be  used  for  a  number  of  practical 

applications  including  all-optical  switching  and  power-dependent  soliton  steering  [6].

Properties  of  single  solitons  and  soliton  complexes  supported  by  one-  and  two-

dimensional  optical  lattices  are  now  well  established  [7-13].  Lately  we  addressed 

properties of solitons supported by radially symmetric Bessel lattices [14]. Such lattices 

could be photoinduced by nondiffracting zero-order Bessel beams and offer a lot of new 

opportunities  including  control  of  soliton  interactions  in  different  lattice  rings  and 

possibility to set solitons into controllable rotary motion. 

It was demonstrated recently that the presence of shallow longitudinal modulation 

of linear refractive index profoundly affects properties of solitons trapped in the guiding 

channel of one-dimensional optical lattice [15,16]. In particular, parametric amplification 

of  transverse  swinging  and  amplitude  oscillations  of  spatial  solitons  is  possible  under 

appropriate conditions. The former effect can be potentially used for controllable soliton 

steering  and  fine-tuning  of  soliton  inclination  angle  at  the  output  face  of  the  crystal. 

Two-dimensional generalization of this technique is far from being trivial because of the 

presence of the second transverse dimension, hence more complicated soliton trajectories. 

Moreover, despite the fact that in the absence of longitudinal modulation harmonic and 

Bessel lattices can support stable two-dimensional solitons even in a cubic medium, the 

open question is whether two-dimensional soliton is sufficiently robust to survive under 

remarkable longitudinal modulation of the linear refractive index which is necessary for 

effective parametric amplification of the soliton swinging? 

In  this  paper  we  show  that  a  considerable  parametric  amplification  of  soliton 

swinging can be achieved in two-dimensional case when small nonlinearity saturation is 

taken into account. We have found that transverse oscillations of the soliton center are 

coupled  even  in  the  absence  of  longitudinal  modulation.  This  coupling  is  strong  if 

frequencies of soliton beam oscillations along both transverse axes coincide, otherwise it 

is weak and parametric amplification of soliton center swinging along a selected axis is 

possible. We discuss some potential practical applications of parametric amplification of 

soliton swinging. 

Our  analysis  is  based  on  the  nonlinear  Schrödinger  equation  describing 

propagation of a laser beam in a medium with focusing Kerr-type saturable nonlinearity 

and spatial modulation of refractive index along longitudinal and transverse directions:

factor (see Fig. 1(a) and 1(b)). The depth of refractive index modulation is assumed to 

be  small  compared  with  the  unperturbed  refractive  index,  and  is  of  the  order  of 

nonlinear contribution due to the Kerr effect. Longitudinal modulation is supposed to be 

weak  and  smooth  that  enables  one  to  neglect  the  reflected  wave.  In  practice  the 

refractive  index  modulation  in  transverse  direction  can  be  induced  optically  in 

photorefractive crystals with several interfering plane waves [1-4] or with nondiffracting 

Bessel beams [14]. Longitudinal modulation can be created in such media with spatially 

periodic  background 

illumination  along  ξ -axis.  Though 

in  the  case  of  real 

photorefractive crystal the model equation describing soliton propagation would be more 

complicated than Eq. (1) since the refractive index profile will also depend on the level 

of saturation, we expect that simplified model (1) adequately describes main qualitative 

features of soliton swinging. Notice that the total energy flow

Mathematically, families of soliton solutions of Eq. (3) are defined by parameters:

  and  transverse  configuration  of  the  lattice.  Thus,  fundamental  soliton  supported  by 

the  Bessel  lattice  is  radially  symmetric  and  the  position  of  its  intensity  maximum 

coincide  with  the  center  of  the  lattice,  while  in  harmonic  lattices  soliton  can  be 

supported  by  either  guiding  site  of  the  lattice.  Here  we  found  corresponding  soliton 

profiles  numerically  using  the  standard  relaxation  method.  Typically  we  used 

discretization scheme with 1024

set  to  d

.  Zero  boundary  conditions  were  implemented.  The  progressive 

iterations  in  relaxation  method  were  carried  out  until  the  relative  difference  between 

profiles on two successive iterations decreases below  10

. The accuracy of calculations 

20−

was  checked  by  doubling  the  number  of  points  per  profile  as  well  as  by  expanding  of 

computation  window  (for  broad  solitons).  The  energy  flow  of  solitons  supported  by 

Bessel  and  harmonic  lattices  versus  propagation  constant  is  shown  in  Fig.  1(c)  for 

different values of the saturation parameter. For convenience of comparison we selected 

the scaling factor  b  for Bessel lattice in such way that the first zero of Bessel lattice 

lin

coincides  with  that  of  the  harmonic  one  (Fig.  1(a)  and  1(b)).  Energy  flows  U   of 

b,h

solitons supported by lattices of both types grow monotonically with increase of  b  that 

indicates soliton stability [14] for chosen lattice parameters. Dispersion curves U

( )b

 and 

b

U

h( )b

 are quite similar and differ notably only near a lower cut-off for soliton existence 

where  soliton  spreads  over  many  lattice  sites  and  exact  periodicity  of  harmonic  lattice 

and  decaying  behavior  of  the  tail  of  Bessel  lattice  play  a  crucial  role.  As  one  can  see 

from Fig. 1(c) the cutoff for solitons supported by Bessel lattices is a bit lower than that 

for solitons in harmonic lattices.

While exact solitons whose intensity maximum position coincides with maximum 

of the lattice will propagate in a stable way without any distortions, the small transverse 

displacement or tilt of the input soliton with respect to the lattice causes oscillations of 

the beam center in transverse plane upon propagation. Further, for illustration of main 

propagation  scenarios  of  solitons  in  modulated  lattices  we  solve  Eq.  (1)  with  an  input 

condition

To  understand  multidimensional  dynamics  of  tilted  or  shifted  soliton  beams  in 

optical lattices one can use an effective particle approach [15,16], based on equations of

depends on the ratio between the characteristic lattice and beam scales, as well as on the 

depth  of  the  lattice.  In  optically  induced  lattices  this  parameter  can  be  fine-tuned  by 

changing the lattice depth. This enables to control effectively dynamics of soliton motion 

inside the lattice for the same input profiles. Notice that other trial expressions for beam 

profile lead to the very similar equations for soliton center coordinates. As one can see 

from Eqs. (6), there is a straightforward analogy between equations of soliton movement 

in  harmonic  lattice  and  equations  of  motion  for  coupled  parametrically  driven 

pendulums.  For  the  simplest  case 

µ =

  and  small  initial  soliton  center  displacements 

along

However even at  µ

 large-amplitude oscillations of the soliton center along  η

soliton  swinging  in  optical  lattices  in  comparison  with  this  phenomenon  in  one-

dimensional 

lattices 

[15]. 

If 

large-amplitude  oscillations  along 

η

approximately  at  the  same  frequency  as  small-amplitude  ones  along 

ζ

-axis  (i.e.  when 

Ω

ζ

)  the  parametric  resonance  arises.  Such  parametric-type  interaction  opens  an 

opportunity to transform effectively large amplitude 

η

-oscillations into oscillations along 

ζ

-axis  (Fig.  2(a)).  This  process  repeats  periodically  in 

ξ

  and  looks  like  an  amplitude 

beatings.  Notice  that  under  appropriate  conditions  predictions  of  the  effective  particle 

model (Eqs. (6)) are in a reasonable agreement with results of direct integration of Eq. 

(1) with input conditions (4). Thus at

the  basis  of  Eq.  (6)  for  the  Gaussian  input  beam  with  the  same  energy  flow  is  about 

13%. 

More  complicated  situation  occurs  in  lattices  with  longitudinal  refractive  index 

modulation. In such lattices the soliton center starts to swing with exponentially growing 

amplitude  provided  that  the  first  parametric  resonance  condition  Ω

ξ ≈ Ω
02

 is satisfied 

(here 

0Ω

  is  the  frequency  of  free  oscillations).  The  simplest  case  corresponds  to  the 

absence of coupling between 

η

- and  ζ -oscillations. This can be achieved when soliton is 

initially shifted along the only one of transverse axes and swinging occurs in one plane 

(Fig. 2(b)). Notice that growth of the oscillation amplitude leads to diminishing of the 

instantaneous  frequency,  and  the  system  escapes  from  the  condition  of  parametric 

resonance.  This  results  in  periodic  in 

ξ

  decay  and  growth  of  soliton  oscillations  (or 

beatings). In this case the effective particle approach also offers quite realistic estimate 

for  beating  length  and  maximal  value  of  transverse  displacement  of  the  soliton  center. 

For example, at

.1

 the relative difference in calculation of beating length in the 

frames  of  two  approaches  is  around  11%,  and  accuracy  of  calculation  of  the  maximal 

value of transverse displacement of the soliton center is around 2.5%. 

Another  opportunity  to  avoid  the  coupling  between  η -  and  ζ -oscillations  is 

related  with  “selective”  amplification  of  oscillations  in  the  only  one  of  transverse 

directions. This becomes possible when the frequencies of free oscillations for orthogonal 

axes  are  different  (as  in  harmonic  lattice  with  Ω ≠

)  and  parametric  resonance 

η

Ω
ζ

condition is fulfilled along only one axis. Fig. 3(a) illustrates the process of the selective 

parametric amplification. 

The  most  complicated  situation  occurs  when process of parametric amplification 

is  accompanied  by  coupling  between  large-amplitude  oscillations  along  η -  and  ζ -axes. 

To realize such regime we shifted input soliton along 

ζ

-axis and simultaneously tilted it 

along 

η

-axis.  In  the  absence  of  longitudinal  modulation  soliton  follows  closed  elliptical 

(or  circular  in  particular  case)  trajectory,  thus  performing  steady  spiraling.  Parametric 

amplification results in growth of the radius of the spiral trajectory on the initial stage 

of  propagation.  Finally  spiral  trajectory  transforms  into  zigzag  one,  which  means  that 

oscillations  along 

η

-  and  ζ -axes,  which  were  initially  phase-shifted  by  π

/ 2

,  become 

 

7

phase-matched (Fig. 3(b)). After this stage of propagation the system escapes from the 

parametric resonance condition and the trajectory transforms into the elliptical one. 

The  parametric  amplification  of  two-dimensional  soliton  swinging  can  be 

effectively used for the detection of the very small displacement and/or tilt of the input 

beam.  For  instance,  in  the  longitudinally  modulated  Bessel  lattice  the  initial 

displacement less than one percent of the beam width might be amplified parametrically 

up to the beam width, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a) (the white circle shows the first zero of 

the Bessel lattice). Moreover the parametric amplification can be used for fine-tuning of 

output tilt angle, while selective amplification can be used to enhance soliton oscillations 

in desired direction. 

The  key  result  of  this  work  is  summarized  in  Fig.  4(b),  showing  the  resonance

curve  for  transverse  oscillations  of  two-dimensional  soliton  in  the  longitudinally 

modulated Bessel lattice, i.e. dependence of the ratio between maximal

. This dependence has the form of a classical asymmetric 

parametric  resonance  curve  for  oscillator  with  “soft”  sin-type  nonlinearity.  The 

maximum  value  of  parametric  amplification  is  reached  at  small  negative  value  of 

frequency  detuning.  It  should  be  also  mentioned  that  the  resonance  curve  is  relatively 

narrow that allows highly selective amplification. We also want to stress that for a fixed 

frequency  of  longitudinal  modulation 

  the  parametric  resonance  conditions  can  be 

ξΩ

achieved by tuning the lattice depth 

p

, since frequency of free oscillations  Ω  depends 

0

on the lattice depth, as it follows from Eqs. (6) and (7). Notice that oscillations of two-

dimensional  soliton  are  accompanied  by  radiation,  but  its  rate  is  substantially  reduced 

with growth of nonlinearity saturation and soliton energy flow. 

In conclusion, we showed that in harmonic and Bessel lattices imprinted in Kerr-

type  saturable  medium  it  is  possible  to  achieve  considerable  parametric-type 

amplification of soliton swinging in the guiding lattice channel. This effect may find its 

applications  for  controllable  soliton  steering,  for  detection  of  submicron  beam 

displacement and extremely small misalignments.

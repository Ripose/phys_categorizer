Abstract: 

Alkane  mixtures  are  model  systems  where  the  influence  of  surface  tension  gradients  during  the 

spreading and the evaporation of wetting drops can be easily studied. The surface tension gradients 

are mainly induced by concentration gradients, mass diffusion being a stabilising process. Depending 

on the relative concentration of the mixture, a rich pattern of behaviours is obtained.

I. Introduction 

Heat  transfer  controlled  by  the  evaporation  of  liquids  on  solid  substrates,  is  the  subject  of 

many experiments and numerical analyses [1-4]. On the other hand, most industrial coating processes 

use  solutions  of  the  active  compounds  in  volatile  solvents.  In  both  cases,  surface  tension  gradients 

result  from  thermal  and/or  concentration  gradients.  The  surface  flow  may  significantly  interplay  with 

the  heat  transfer  or  coating  process,  possibly  leading  to  film  rupture  and  dendritic  instabilities  [1-9]. 

The behaviour of the contact line is of specific interest from the theoretical point of view, because both 

the evaporation flux and the dissipation are singular in a hydrodynamic analysis [10-11].  

We are interested in situations where the gradients are merely due to the evaporating process, 

and  not  driven  externally.  In  that  case,  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  surface  tension 

gradients induced by thermal or concentration gradients. Thermally induced surface tension gradients 

are  usually  weak,  and  thermal  diffusion,  which  is  a  stabilising  process,  is  fast.  Moreover,  thermal 

exchanges with the substrate come into play. On the contrary, concentration-induced surface tension 

gradients are usually large, mass diffusion is slow, and there is no mass exchange with the substrate.  

The present paper is devoted to the evaporation of drops composed of binary alkane mixtures. 

This  is  a  simple  case  if  compared  with  polar  mixtures  previously  studied  by  Marmur  et  al.  [12-13], 

because the interactions in alkanes are purely dispersive, the mixtures are ideal ones, and complete 

wetting is always achieved. The same systems have already been studied in another geometry with a 

liquid reservoir [14-15], then mimicking the well-known "tears of wine" problem [16-17].  

II. Materials, methods and a summary of results for pure alkanes 

The  substrates  are  oxidised  silicon  wafers,  made  hydrophilic  by  proper  cleaning  ("piranha" 

solution: 1/3 H2O2, 2/3 H2SO4). The liquids used are alkanes, from nonane to hexane (Aldrich, >99% 

pure),  most  of  the  results  being  obtained  with  the  heptane/octane  mixture.  Pure  alkanes  as  well  as 

their mixtures wet the substrates completely. 

The relevant physical parameters of the pure alkanes at 20°C are given in table I.

When  deposited  on  the  substrate,  the  drops  first  spread  and  the  radius 

(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:2)(cid:3)   of  the  wetted 

spot increases. Then spreading and evaporation balance and 

(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:2)(cid:3)  goes to a maximum value  (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:3)

. 

(cid:3)(cid:1)

Later on, evaporation becomes dominant, the radius decreases, and the drop ultimately disappears at 

a time 

(cid:2) = .  
(cid:4)(cid:2)

The  dynamics  of  drops  is  followed  under  microscope  at  low  magnification,  in  normal 

atmosphere,  with  protections  against  air  draft.  The  drops  are  always  very  flat,  therefore  equal 

thickness interference fringes are easily observed and allow us to get information on the profiles.  

Our  previous  work  has  dealt  with  the  evaporation  of  the  pure  alkanes  on  the  same  kind  of 

substrates [11, 18]. During the retraction of the drops, the radius 

(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:2)(cid:3)  scales as  (
(cid:2)

(cid:4)

)(cid:4)(cid:2)

, where the 

exponent  (cid:4)  is slightly less than 0.5 (between 0.48 for hexane and 0.44 for nonane).  

Such a behaviour is reminiscent of the one of spherical aerosol droplets evaporating slowly in 

a gas phase, in which case the exponent is exactly 0.5 [19-20]. The reason why is that evaporation is 

controlled by the diffusion of the vapour molecules in the gas phase. Just above the free interface, the 

concentration  (cid:5)  of the vapour is equal to the value at saturation 

, therefore a constant if thermal 

(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:5)

and  curvature  effects  are  negligible.  At  infinity,  (cid:5)   is  also  fixed  and  equal  to  zero.  With  these  fixed 

boundary  conditions,  a  quasi-stationary  solution  is  reached  rapidly.  In  such  a  diffusive,  stationary 

process, the laplacian 

 is equal to 0. 

(cid:5)D

Given  that  the  evaporation  is  proportional  to 

  taken  at  the  interface,  the  total  rate  of 

(cid:5)(cid:209)

evaporation of the drop is proportional to the drop radius (and not to the drop area, as it would be the 

case  in  vacuum).  This  feature  is  characteristic  of  diffusion  limited  evaporation  and  leads  to  an 

exponent 0.5 in the case of spherical drops, in good agreement with experiments.  

For sessile drops, the presence of the substrate, and the specific processes occurring at the 

moving contact line make the problem more complex. Now, both radius and contact angle have to be 

considered. However, evaporation still proceeds by the stationary diffusion of the vapour molecules in 

the  gas  phase,  and  the  laplacian 

  is  still  equal  to  0.  The  total  rate  of  evaporation  of  the  drop  is 

(cid:5)D

proportional to the radius of the wetted spot, and the exponent  (cid:4)  is close to 0.5. These evaporating 

drops are always close to spherical caps, with small contact angles, of the order of 0.04 rd or less. 

The situation is significantly different with mixtures.  

 

III. Experimental results for alkane mixtures 

A  remarkable  feature  is  that,  for  a  given  initial  volume,  a  drop  of  mixture  may  evaporate 

faster than a drop of the most volatile pure alkane, see figure 1a. As the rate of evaporation of a drop 

increases with the size of the wetted spot, this corresponds to the fact that the maximum radius  (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:3)

 

for the mixture is usually larger than the ones of pure alkanes, see figure 1b. This non-monotonous 

dependence of  (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:3)

 with the composition of the mixture is due to the presence of outwardly directed 

surface  tension  gradients,  which  accelerate  the  spreading  process,  see  figure  1c.  One  may  also 

record the maximum radius as a function of deposited volume for various initial concentrations of the 

mixture, see figure 1d.

A more detailed observation reveals a very rich pattern of behaviour. We observe at short 

time  after  deposition  (1-10s)  that,  for  any  mixture  at  any  concentration,  the  shape  of  the  drop  is 

distorted.  This  corresponds  to  the  change  in  the  spreading  rate  due  to  arising  surface  tension 

gradients (see figure 1c). At intermediate concentrations, more or less complete breaking is observed 

during  the  receding  motion  between  the  central  part  of  the  drop  and  an  outer  ring,  whereas  no 

breaking is observed at low and high concentration. In the case where the drop splits in two parts, the 

centre evaporates faster than the ring at lower concentrations, and conversely, see figure 2a,b.  

In  the  present  paper,  we  will  focus  on  the  heptane-octane  mixture,  and  give  some  trends  for  other 

ones.  Heptane  evaporates  four  times  faster  than  octane,  and  its  surface  tension  is  smaller  than  the 

one of octane (see table I). The molecule sizes are approximately the same.  

In  the  ranges  of  concentration  where  the  drops  are  "stable",  it  is  possible  to  define  and 

measure their radius as a function of time. The data are plotted on figure 3 for a given initial volume 

(cid:8) of the drops as a function of 

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

,(cid:1) together with the data for pure alkanes. For  (cid:8)  = 0.4µL, the 

(cid:4)

range of initial concentrations  (cid:4)(cid:9)  where drops are "unstable" is roughly 0.065 < (cid:4)(cid:9) < 0.17. Here, (cid:4)(cid:9) is 

defined either as the initial relative volume of the more volatile alkane or as the relative initial number 

of molecules.  

One sees immediately that the curves at "low" concentration,  (cid:4)(cid:9) < 0.065 differ qualitatively 

from the ones at "large" concentration,  (cid:4)(cid:9)  > 0.17. At low initial concentration, the curves merge with 
the one of the pure, less volatile alkane within the drop life. This means that the more volatile alkane 

has  completely  disappeared,  together  with  any  concentration  gradient,  before  the  end  of  the 

evaporation  process.  This  is  no  longer  the  case  for  large  initial  concentrations  (cid:4)(cid:9)   >  0.17,  in  which 
case the gradient is obviously present during the whole process. 

The same behaviour is observed with the other mixtures, see figure 4 for octane-hexane 

and heptane-nonane.  

Unstable drops can be characterised qualitatively by the time evolution of the profile. The 

observed  behaviour  together  with  the  schematic  evolution  of  shapes  is  summarised  on  figure  5. 
Stable  drops  at  "low"  concentration  are  observed  in  the  a -domain  of  the  diagram,  see  figure  6.  At 

larger  concentration  and  /  or  volume,  unstable  drops  are  obtained,  where  the  centre  of  the  drop 

disappears  before  an  external  ring.  If  concentration  is  increased,  the  external  ring  disappears  first. 

Then stable drops are again observed, corresponding to the "large" concentrations in figures 3-4. This 
is  the  b -domain  of  the  diagram,  see  figure  7.  Unstable  drops  correspond  to  the  g -domain. 

Corresponding  pictures  are  shown  on  figure  2a,b.  Very  small  drops  are  stable  whatever  the  initial 
concentration is, which means that a - and  b -domains merge at the bottom of the diagram on figure 

Even  for  stable  drops,  the  profiles  are  far  from  being  always  spherical  caps.  They  result 

from  a  complex  interplay  between  evaporation,  surface  tension  gradients,  hydrodynamic  flow,  mass 

diffusion, and capillary forces. It is clear that both capillary forces, which tend to reduce the drop area

when the surface tension is constant, and mass diffusion will be dominant for very small drops, and 
promote stability. This explains why small drops are stable, and also why the boundary between  a - 
and g -domains depends both on concentration and drop size. Saying more needs a specific analysis. 

IV. Equations and simplified models 

The aim of this part is not to write and solve exact equations, which is largely out of the scope of the 

paper,  but  rather  to  introduce  explicitly  the  specific  parameters  relevant  for  the  problem,  and  the 

typical approximations involved. After a brief reminder of the equations available for pure alkanes, the 

case of mixtures will be addressed. 

IV.1. General equation for an evaporating drop [11]. 

The  starting  point  for  the  evolution  of  drops  is  the  local  conservation  equation  (radial 

symmetry is assumed):

 is the capillary term (the Laplace pressure), and P

(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:16) the disjoining pressure, which 

accounts  for  the  specific  properties  of  very  thin  films  [21].  The  last  term  in  equation  (2)  is  the 

Marangoni flow, and shows up in the presence of a surface tension gradient. 

For a homogeneous liquid, assuming a diffusion-controlled, quasi-stationary evaporation 

process,  and  considering  that  the  slope  of  the  interface,  and  noticeably  the  contact  angle,  are  very 

small, the evaporation rate can be written as [22-25]:

where  (cid:3)  is  the  radius  of  the  drop.  As  already  mentioned,  the  rate  of  change  of  the  drop  volume, 

obtained by integrating the conservation equation over the drop’s surface, is proportional to (cid:3), like in 

aerosols. However, in the case of sessile drops, the rate of evaporation is not uniform, in contrast with 

(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)

 is maximum at the edge, because the molecules leaving the liquid interface there have 

a lesser probability to come back to the drop during their diffusive motion inside the gas phase. 

Solving the dynamic equation requires to analyse explicitly the behaviour of various terms 

(interface  curvature,  disjoining  pressure  and  evaporation  rate)  at  the  moving  contact  line,  because 

they  all  diverge  in  a  macroscopic  description.  A  regularisation  procedure  has  been  proposed  by  M. 

Ben Amar and co-workers, and accounts satisfactorily for the data obtained with alkanes [11]. In the 

following, we shall therefore ignore the various divergences at the contact line, because the solution of 

the problem is available elsewhere. Noticeably, the disjoining pressure will no longer be considered. 

IV.2. The case of mixtures. 

 

The case of mixtures is necessarily complex because, after some time, the local concentration 

in the drop depends explicitly on position and time, due to the variation of evaporation rate over the 

interface.  The  places  where 

  is  larger  are  depleted  in  the  most  volatile  alkane.  As  the  most 

(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:11)

volatile alkane also has the lowest surface tension, surface tension gradients result, directed towards 

the places where 

(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:11)

 is larger.  

An explicit resolution of the equations is out of question, therefore we shall discuss only very 

specific, simple cases and propose empirical arguments for the observed behaviour. 

Equations (1-3) must be first rewritten in the case of mixtures.  

A  first,  plausible  approximation  is  to  assume  a  complete  mixing  of  the  two  alkanes  over  the 

thickness  of  the  film,  which  is  always  less  than  10µm.  Typical  values  for  the  mass  diffusion 
coefficients  are  around  4  10-9m2/s  for  the  mixtures  considered.  The  characteristic  time  for  diffusion 

over 10µm is 0.025s, which supports acceptably the assumption. The same approximation was used 

when discussing the "tears of wine" geometry, and was found to work rather well [26]. Then, the local 
concentration depends only on distance  (cid:10)  to the drop axis, and time  (cid:2) .  

Let  1  be  the  more  volatile  compound,  2  the  less  volatile  one.  The  local  composition  of  the 

mixture can be defined as: 

(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:6)
(cid:2)(cid:10)(cid:9)

=

(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:6)
(cid:2)(cid:10)(cid:17)

(4) 

 is the number of molecules 1, 

(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:2)
(cid:2)(cid:10)(cid:17)
difference between the size of the molecules is neglected, and the mixture is ideal, which means that 

 the number of molecules 2, both per unit volume. The 

(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:3)
(cid:2)(cid:10)(cid:17)

the two compounds evaporate independently.  

Let  (cid:2)(cid:1)  and  (cid:3)(cid:1)  characterise the evaporation rate of the pure alkanes. If the concentration were 

homogeneous over the drop, one could write, without further assumption: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(cid:1)

(cid:14)(cid:1)

(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:6)

(cid:3)
(cid:1)(cid:1)
(cid:2)

 

(5) 

In reality, the concentration depends explicitly on  (cid:10) and (5) holds only at very short times after drop 

deposition.  At  longer  times,  the  formula  (5)  becomes  empirical  but  probably  still  acceptable, 

because the increase of the evaporation rate at the edge of the drop is correctly accounted for in the 

denominator, as well as the relative weight of each alkane in the local evaporation in the numerator. 

Therefore, we shall use the approximation:

The system is far from simple. As in the case of pure liquids, it is possible to integrate the conservation 

equation over the drop free surface to obtain the rate of change of the volume  (cid:8) . However, there is 

no reason why 

(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:6)
(cid:2)(cid:10)(cid:9)

 should be a mere function of 

, which means that the integral of the rhs is 

(cid:10)
(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:2)(cid:3)

no longer strictly proportional to the drop radius. 

Note that if radial mass diffusion were fast, the problem would be simple, as the local concentration 

(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:6)

 would depend only on time

(cid:2)(cid:9)

 and no gradient would come into play. Let us briefly 

discuss that case, later referred to as the “homogeneous droplet model”.

The variation 

(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:2)(cid:3) can be obtained numerically and is represented on figure 8. Whatever the 

value of  (cid:4)(cid:9) , the behaviour of the pure, less volatile alkane is recovered at long times. Noticeably, the 

slope of the log-log plot on the figure is significantly larger than 0.5 at the beginning of the receding 

motion,  which  merely  means  that  the  evaporation  rate  of  the  mixture  slows  down  with  time,  as 

compared with the one of a pure alkane.  

 

In  the  reality,  the  assumption  of  a  complete mixing over the whole drop is irrelevant for the alkanes 

considered.  We  shall  keep  in  mind  that  there  are  two  characteristic  length  scales  namely,  the 

thickness  and  the  lateral  expansion,  which  are  two  orders  of  magnitude  different.  Therefore,  even 

though complete mixing hypothesis is acceptable in the thickness of the drop, a characteristic time for 

diffusion to occur over the drop is of the order of the drops’ life time (typically 250s for 1mm radius).  

Thus, we may consider the opposite case, i.e., what happens when radial diffusion is neglected.  

Then, the equations become:

IV.2.a. Short time response to initial, homogeneous conditions 

It is useful to look at the change in local concentration merely due to the difference in volatility 

of  the  two  alkanes,  i.e.,  ignoring  the  hydrodynamic  flow.  This  can  be  interpreted  as  a  short  time 

response of the system from initial, homogeneous conditions

The place where the gradient is maximum is expected to drift somewhat with time towards the centre, 

especially at low initial concentrations, where the most volatile alkane will completely disappear at the

IV.2.b. Empirical discussion 

At longer times, a radial hydrodynamic flow will take place. The outwardly directed Marangoni 

velocity, which scales like 

 will depress the centre of the drop and build up a thicker rim, as

observed in the experiment (figures 5-6), which means that 

 is no longer monotonous. However, 

(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:12)

flow also causes some mixing and reduces the concentration gradients.

What happens next is hardly predictable but can be explained a posteriori.  

(cid:19)(cid:1)

If  (cid:4)(cid:9)  is small, which is the case in the a -domain of the diagram, the gradient fades out with time 
because  the  most  volatile  alkane  disappears.  The  drops  recover  progressively  a  spherical  cap 
shape.  As  previously  explained,  the  boundary  of  the  a -domain  depends  both  on  initial 

concentration  and  drop  size  because  capillary  pressure  and  mass  diffusion,  which  are  restoring 

terms, are important for small drops. 

(cid:19)(cid:1)

If  (cid:4)(cid:9)  is somewhat larger, two processes come into play. First, the most volatile alkane disappears 

at the edge, which shifts the maximum gradient inside the drop, contributing to thin the film at that 

place.  Second,  there  is  a  direct  coupling  between  local  concentration  and  local  thickness 

(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:12)

 

because 

 scales roughly like 

. If the restoring terms are not large enough, this could 

(cid:9)
(cid:2)

(cid:5)

(cid:13)(cid:6)
(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:18)
(cid:12)

lead to a local dewetting of the substrate, as observed in the experiments. This qualitative analysis 
could account for the g -domain of the diagram. 

(cid:19)(cid:1)

In  b -domain, the thinner zone in the drop shifts progressively to the edge, and reaches it before 

drop  breaking.  For  very  high  concentration  (~80%),  the  rim  disappears  before  the  drop  has 

reached its maximum extension. For lower concentration, this is rather the edge of the drop which 
recedes fast enough to merge with the thin zone. The main feature in  b -domain is the large value 

of flows, which corresponds to the short lifetime of the drops. Contrary to the case  (cid:4)(cid:9)  << 1, where 

the gradients basically fade out with time, the drops where 

 1 will cross the domain of large 

(cid:4)(cid:9)

gradients (

(cid:4)(cid:9)

 0.5) during their life. 

 

IV.2.c. Further comments about the dynamics of stable drops 

A common feature of our drops is the fast spreading rate, as illustrated in figure 1c. The initial 

spreading  rate  is  approximately 

,  as  for  a  pure,  non-volatile,  wetting  liquid.  After  a  few 

(cid:5)(cid:6)
(cid:2)(cid:3)

(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:18)(cid:2)

(cid:2)

seconds,  the  gradients  come  into  play,  while  the  drop  volume  starts  to  decrease.  The  net  result  of 

gradients  and  evaporation  is  a  faster  spreading, 

.  The  exponent  m  is  found  between  0.2 

(cid:181)(cid:5)(cid:6)

(cid:2)(cid:3)

(cid:23)(cid:2)

and 0.3 depending on drop size and composition and it is practically constant till the drop reaches its 

maximum extension.  

The  surface  tension  gradient  is  directed  outwards  during  spreading,  which  increases  the 

radius spreading rate. Although the rate of loss of volume increases accordingly, the maximum radius 

is always larger in the presence of gradients, at least for the mixtures considered. 

For low concentrations (a  domain), the slope  (cid:4)  of the log-log plot is larger than 0.5 in the 

first  part  of  the  retraction.  As  seen  previously  in  the  homogeneous  drop  model,  such  a  slope  is  not 

necessarily the signature of an inwardly directed surface tension gradient, but it provides evidence of 

the presence of a small amount of a more volatile compound in the liquid.  

 

(cid:1)

(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:1)

(cid:181)
At  larger  initial  concentrations,  figure  3  shows  that  the  drops  are  still  mixtures  at  the  end  of 

their life. Like in the previous case, the gradient is certainly directed outwards till the beginning of the 
retraction. As the slope  (cid:4)  is less from 0.5 in the first part of the retraction, one might assume that it is 

still the case. Why  (cid:4)  becomes close to 0.5 during the last part is possibly fortuitous. The question is 

open. 

Conclusion 

 

 

 

 

The present paper presents the various scenarios possible for evaporation of drops of binary 

alkane mixtures, depending on drop volume and mixture concentration. As the two components have 

different surface tensions, surface tension gradients show up rapidly and control the dynamics of the 

system. Noticeably, the problem is not symmetrical with respect to the two components, and only the 

case where the most volatile compound is in small quantity is qualitatively understood. This situation 

has  practical  interest,  because  it  corresponds  to  a  contamination  of  a  liquid  by  a  more  volatile 

compound, with a lower surface tension. This can be detected when the drop is close to its maximum 

extension: the dynamics of spreading is accelerated, and so is the dynamics of retraction if compared 

with the one at larger times.

UPGRADE OF PARTICLE FACTORIES

Abstract 

Recently the luminosity frontier has been raised by the 
Beauty  factories.  Higher  precision  measurements  at  the 
energies  between  the  Φ  and  the  Beauty  are  being 
projected,  and  the  corresponding  increase  of  luminosity 
by orders of magnitude is being faced by the accelerator 
community. The main upgrades and plans in the factories 
presently  in  operation  or  construction  around  the  world 
are here summarized. 

INTRODUCTION 
The  lepton  colliders  are  at  the  frontier  of  high 
luminosity. The effort for centre of mass energy increase 
is  now  devoted  to  the  hadrons  collider  construction  and 
facing the era of linear colliders. In the meantime the non-
search  physics,  dedicated  to  precision  measurements, 
have  in  the  particle  factories  the  field  for  competitive 
studies and especially for the accelerator community there 
is  the  opportunity  of  testing  new  ideas  in  national 
laboratory scales.

Figure 1 - Lepton collider luminosities versus time. 

During  the  e+e-  collider  history  the  luminosity  has 
increased  in  20  years  by  5  orders  of  magnitude  (see 
Fig.1), and the more spectacular advance has been due to 
the great success of the B-factories. 

For  sake  of  discussion,  the  diagram  of  the  luminosity, 
L,  versus  energies,  E,  can  be  divided  in  three  zones  [1] 
(see  Fig.2):  in  the  first  zone  the  energy  increase  is 
privileged  for  new  particles  production,  reaching  the 
maximum  with  LEP;  the  corresponding  luminosity  is 
continuously improved, both for its dependence on energy 
and  for  the  advances  in  technologies  and  collision 

physics.  Beyond  LEP  linear  colliders  will  supplant 
circular ones; VLLC should double LEP energy but at the 
price of one order of magnitude in ring size. In the second 
zone there are the present factories, with luminosities one 
order  of  magnitude  larger  than  the  previous  ones  at  the 
same intermediate energies. The third zone represents the 
future,  in  which  upgrades  by  a  factor  10 seem  reachable 
with  present  technologies,  while  higher  factors  are 
subjected to R&D progress. 

The  annihilation  production  cross  section  in  e+e- 
collisions  is  proportional  to  the  inverse  square  of  the 
energy,  and  the  necessary  integrated  luminosity  scales 
accordingly:

Table  I  shows  the  approximate  integrated  luminosities 
already  collected  by  all  experiments  in  the  energy  range 
between the Φ and the B, and the luminosities requested 
for competitive experiments in the LHC era. The increase 
in integrated luminosity should be reached in a reasonable 
time  scale,  of  few  years:  very  high  peak  luminosity 
together  with  the  overall  reliability  of  the  collider  is  the 
necessary goal for the super-factory projects.  

A review of the plans of e+e- factories according to their 

energy is described in the paper.

BEAUTY FACTORIES 
Two  B-factories  were  conceived in the  90's, with very 
ambitious  design  parameters.  KEK-B  and  PEP-II  have 
reached the design aims in a very short time, compared to 
the scale of accelerator history. PEP-II design luminosity, 
3 1033 cm-2sec-1, was obtained in two years after the start-
up  (see  fig.3),  and  is  now  already  doubled.  The  very 
challenging  KEK-B  design  luminosity,  1  1034  cm-2sec-1 
has  been  reached  few  months  ago  (see  fig.4),  and  is  the 
highest  luminosity  ever  measured.  Both  colliders  are 
based  on  similar  designs:  double  rings  with  asymmetric 
energies,  flat  beams  and  multibunch  regime.  The  beam-
beam  energy  transparency  condition,  which  was  one  of 
the  design  conditions,  has  been  successfully  relaxed  in 
course  of  operation,  by  finding  the  best  current/beam 
sizes configuration to optimize luminosity under different 
regimes.  The  handling  of  IR  backgrounds,  the  operation 
at very high currents, with the successful operation of the 
bunch-by-bunch feedbacks are a noticeable result. Beam-
beam  parameters  have  reached  values  between  0.06  to 
0.09.

Both KEKB and PEPII plan upgrades for the next two-
three  years,  optimizing  the  existing  systems  to  reach 
luminosities  of  few  1034cm-2sec-1.  Further  steps  on 
luminosity are being planned in a time scale of 10 years. 
The  main  parameters  for 
the  future  upgrades  are 
summarized in Table2 for both projects [2][3].

CESR  has  operated  in  this  same  range  of  energy.  The 
collider  performances  have  been  continuously  improved, 
to  be  competitive  with  the  newer  collider  generations. 
Now it is operated also at lower energies and can cover all 
the physics from the J/Ψ to the Beauty.

*  will  be 
pushing  parameters  to  more  limiting  values: βy
decreased by 50% by moving quadrupoles closer to IP, a 
small  crossing  angle  in  the  new  IR  will  be  introduced, 
higher  currents  will  be  based  on  the  feedback  system 
upgrade  to  go  to  2-bucket  spacing.  All  these  actions 
should push luminosities up to 2-4 1034 cm-2sec-1. ξx,y of 
0.08 are considered achievable. 

Higher  luminosity  considerations  will  be  of  course 
related  to  the  achievements  obtained  at  that  point;  with 
the  today  know-how, the idea is to increase the collision 
frequency  by  filling  all  the  buckets,  without  increasing 
bunch currents, together with a larger crossing angle and 
smaller  betas  at the  IP. The  total current will be doubled 
and  to  save  wall  power  the  energy  asymmetry  will  be 
diminished. Tune shifts will be 0.1 and L of the order of 
1035cm-2sec-1.  

The main upgrade for a further increase is the change of 
the RF frequency by a factor of two to double the number 
of  bunches.  With  frf  equal  to  950  MHz,  the  bunch 
separation  goes  to  1  nsec,  and  a  further  increase  of  the 
crossing  angle  is  foreseen.  Figure  6 shows the  IR layout 
for  this  configuration.  With  the  same  b-b  tune  shift  and 
slightly lower currents per bunch the total L could reach 
values  of  1036  cm-2sec-1.    R&D  on  the  RF  cavity  and 
related systems is already in progress. 

KEK-B upgrades[3] 

The  Japanese  B-factory  exceeded  the  1034  cm-2sec-1,  the 
maximum  luminosity  ever  reached,  in  May  2003.  Not 
only  the  peak  luminosity,  but  also  the  continuous 
reliability  of  the  whole collider,  has  allowed the  BELLE 
detector to collect a huge amount of data in a very short 
time. At the end of this year the collider runs normally at 
peak luminosity higher than 1034 cm-2sec-1 and integrated 
luminosity per day exceeding 600 pbarn-1. 
The upgrades for a factor 10 on the luminosity are based 
on an increase of the colliding current by multiplying the 
bunch  number by  a factor of 4, and increasing also each 
*  by  a  factor  of  2  and 
bunch  current,  lowering  βy
increasing 
the 
horizontal  emittance  the  b-b  tune  shifts  are  maintained 
equal to the present ones. The main challenge is the high 
current  effects;  the  RF  system  will  be  upgraded  and  SC 
RF cavities will be added (see fig. 7)

envisaged, to store e+ in the high energy ring. An upgrade 
of the injector is thus being studied to accelerate positrons 
up to 8 GeV. Intensive R&D on vacuum chamber design, 
with antechambers and special RF shields is in progress, 
and prototypes are being constructed to be tested soon in 
the collider.

Very high beam-beam parameter, >0.1, is needed to get 
the high luminosity, otherwise very high operating current 
or  very  small  beta  function  at  the  collision  point  are 
required.  Beam-beam  simulations  are  being  carried  out; 
they  indicate  that  at  very  high  values  of  tune  shift  the 
effects  of  crossing  angle  are  dramatic.  Based  on  these 
results the philosophy for reaching 1036 cm-2sec-1 is based 
on  head-on  collisions  obtained  with  crab  cavities.  The 
first  test  crab-cavity  will  be  installed  in  one  year  in  the 
ring for experiments. Lowering the coupling should help 
in obtaining the very high ξy.

The  beam  lifetimes  will  be  very  low  and  continuous 
injection  will  be  needed  and  it  will  be  used  to  push  the 
beam-beam  parameter  to  higher  values  than  those  which 
can be tolerated when long lifetimes are required. Bunch-
by-bunch  feedbacks  will  need  to  operate  at  the  1  nsec 
scale,  down  from  the  present  4  nsec  time.  Much  shorter 
bunches  will  be  needed,  of  the  order  of  2  mm.  Higher-
power  vacuum  chambers  and  HOM  tolerant  chambers 
will be needed. The use of expansion bellows will need to 
be  minimized  or  a  high-power  design  developed.  Very 
low vertical beta functions at the interaction of about 1.5 
to  2.5  mm  will  be  needed,  together  with  special 
chromaticity  corrections.  Every  technique  to  reduce  the 
wall  plug  power  will  be  used:  for  example,  increase  the 
vacuum  chamber  bores  to  reduce  resistive  wall  effects, 
and increasing the RF cavity bores to reduce HOM losses.

BEPCII, CESRc 

CESR[4]  has  been  upgraded  to  operate  at  lower 
energies. The  lengthening  of  the  damping  time  is  fought 
by  new  wigglers  (see  fig.8)  which  increase  radiation 
damping.  The  first  six  wigglers  have  been  already 
installed  and  commissioned.  Other  six  wigglers  will  be 
installed  in  one  year  and  CESRc  will  run  until  2008  at 
three energies between 3.1 and 4.1 GeV.  

Fig. 8 - CESR-c wiggler 

The  Chinese  collider  BEPC[5]  is  being  upgraded  to 
become the first completely dedicated tau-charm factory, 
still maintaining the synchrotron radiation production. Its 
design  is  based  on  the  double  ring  scheme  (see  fig.9), 
with energies ranging between 1.5 and 2.5GeV per beam, 
optimized  at  1.89  GeV.  An  inner  ring  will  be  installed 
inside  the  old  one,  so  that  each  beam  will  travel  in  half 
outer  ring  and  half  inner  one.  Superconducting  cavities 
fitting  the  bunch  length  requirements  will  be  installed. 
The  production  began  in  2002  and  commissioning  is 
foreseen for 2006.

LIGHT QUARKS FACTORIES 
Physics at energies between the φ and the τ−charm has 
been  investigated  during  last  years  in  VEPP-2M  (shut- 
down  in  2000)  and  BEPC  colliders. The  interest  for  this 
energy  range  had  produced  the  proposal  for  PEP-N  [8]. 
Now a collider, innovative in its design and concepts, is in 
the 
construction:  VEPP2000.  At

A  2  GeV  collider  (from  there  the  2000  in  the  name), 
whose  design is based on the concept of round colliding 
beams,  is  being  constructed  in  Novosibirsk[9],  after  the 
shutdown  of  VEPP-2M  three  years  ago.  This  is  a  very 
important 
interaction 
understanding.  The  expected  b-b  tune  shift  is  half  the 
corresponding  flat-beam  one  with  the  same  particle 
density,  thus  predicting  a  single  bunch  luminosity  of 
1032cm-2sec-1.

The collider can be operated also with flat beams and at 
energies  ranging  from  500  Mev  to  1  GeV  per  beam.  Its 
compact  design  is  based  on  very  high  field  normal 
conducting dipoles (2.4T) and houses two experiments in 
the  two  symmetric  Interaction  Regions.  Focusing  in  the 
two  interaction  regions  is  performed  by  SC  solenoids, 
the  planes  of  betatron 
which  also  rotate  by  π/2 
oscillations, thus originating emittance in both transverse 
modes.  Dynamic  aperture  is  challenging  due  to  the  high 
chromaticity and beam sizes on both planes.  

Dipoles  are  being  installed,  solenoids  are  in  the 
construction phase and first beam is foreseen at the end of 
next year. 

The  full  description  of  the  project  is  the  subject  of  a 
contribution  to  the  workshop  [9].  Figure  10  shows  an 
artistic view of the ring. 

 

 

DAΦNE 

In  two  or  three  years  all  the  DAΦNE  current  physics 
programs  are  expected  to  be  completed,  with  an  overall 
delivered  integrated  luminosity  in  excess  of  3fb-1  and 
luminosities higher than 1032cm-2sec-1. [11] 

The  interest  for  values  of  the  luminosity  larger  by  a 
factor  10  than  the  design  ones  has  led  to  the  study  of 
possible new designs of the factory.  

During  this  workshop the  design of  a Φ-factory based 
on the strong RF focusing principle is discussed in several 
contributions (see for example [12], [13]). At the state of 
art, this idea seems to be the more appealing in terms of 
luminosity increase for the low energy factory. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 
In  the  next  future  the  present  lepton  factories  will  be 
optimized  by  stretching  the  design  parameters,  without 
introducing essentially any new concept in the luminosity 
production, expecting in all cases an increase in peak and 
integrated luminosity by about a factor 10. 

 New  ideas  to  push  the  luminosity  values  by  another 
order  of  magnitude  are  being  investigated.  Round  beam 
collisions will soon be tested at VEPP2000, answering to 
the  question  whether  b-b  tune  shift  limits  can  be  raised. 
The  strong  rf  focusing  principle, 
introduced  as  a 
possibility to obtain very short bunches at the IP, deserves 
a proof of principle for validation.

operate  also  at  higher  energies.  It  is  presently  under 
discussion which will be the future of the collider. One of 
the  possibilities  is  to  increase  the  energy  by  a  factor  of 
two  [10].  The  project  is  named  DAFNE2,  where  "F" 
stands for Frascati and "2" for Ecm. No crucial issues from 
the  accelerator  physics  point  of  view  are  envisaged. The 
main hardware modifications concern the dipoles and the 
Interaction  Region,  while  RF  and  vacuum  systems  are 
already  dimensioned  for  the  high  energy,  with  a  lower 
beam  current.  The  main  parameters  are  given  in  table  4 
together  with  those  of VEPP2000  for  comparison. To  be 
noticed that the same luminosity claimed by both projects 
has an essential difference: in VEPP2000 it is obtained in 
single  bunch  mode,  while  in  DAFNE2  is  obtained  in 
multibunch configuration. 

 

Φ-FACTORIES 
DAΦNE  is  the  only Φ-Factory  presently  in  operation. 
VEPP2000 can be operated also at the Φ resonance, with 
of course luminosity lower than the optimum one.

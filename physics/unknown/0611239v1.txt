Abstract- Some variational micro-macro models are briefly reviewed: it is shown how, starting from the Taylor 
model and passing through the relaxed Taylor model, a consistent intermediate between Taylor's upper bound and 
the lower bound (Sachs or rather "static") model was obtained. This intermediate or "inhomogeneous" variational 
model (indeed, it generally predicts both strain and stress to be inhomogeneous) could offer a general alternative to 
self-consistent models. However, the implemented version was a rather empirical model (ARMINJON [1984]) with a 
less well-defined status. We present current progress in the implementation of the correct version. 
 
 

INTRODUCTION 
 

 
As a model for micro-macro transition, the classical Taylor model is none other than the transposition to 
polycrystal plasticity of Voigt's uniform strain model, proposed for polycrystal elasticity: the new feature in Taylor's 
model  was  the  principle  of  minimum  plastic  work.  This  "principle",  and  Hill's  maximum  work  principle  as  well, 
were  later  recognized  by  BISHOP  &  HILL  [1951]  to  be  derivable  properties  of  the  single  crystal  constitutive  law 
based on Schmid's law. They also proved that, under a no-correlation condition between the microscopic fields of 
stress  and  incremental  strain,  the  maximum  work  principle,  i.e.  the  normality  flow  rule,  is  transmitted  from  the 
crystal  level  to  the  polycrystal  scale.  These  results  were  obtained  without  any  recourse  to  the  Taylor  model,  i.e. 
without assuming that the strain increment is uniform in the polycrystal. Yet in the same work, they proved that the 
latter assumption provides an upper bound to the polycrystal yield surface. 
 
When extensive numerical calculations could be done, it was established that the main shortcomings of the 
 
Taylor  model  concern  the  prediction  of  deformation  textures,  which  agree  only  qualitatively  with  the  measured 
ones. This result is a particular case of a quite general feature in micro-macro transition- namely, that it is easier, 
hence more dangerous for the models, to consistently check the localization process (predict the micro-fields from 
the  data  of  the  overall  stimulus)  than  to  do  so  for  the  homogenization  process  (predict  the  overall  response,  by 
averaging the predicted field of microscopic response, found in the localization step). The explanation is in terms of 
a  balance  between  input  and  output  data.  In  order  to  run  the  model,  one  must  know  at  least  (i)  the  microscopic 
c  
constitutive law, depending on the "state", i.e. on some list X of internal and geometrical variables, e.g. X = (R, (τs
c  (1 ≤ s ≤ S) the critical shear stresses, and (ii) the volume distribution of X 
)) with R the crystal orientation and τs
(e.g. the ODF). In practice, often too little is known about this (e.g. little is known as regards the distribution of the 
critical shear stresses), so one has to make plausible assumptions which still leave some unknown parameters. But 
often  also,  few  overall  mechanical  properties  are  known  securely.  The  result  is  that  the  remaining  unknown 
microstructural  parameters  can  often  be  selected  so  as  to  get  a  reasonable  agreement  between  measured  and 
predicted overall properties (if one uses a reasonable model and if the inhomogeneity is moderated, as is the case for 
orientation-governed  inhomogeneity  in  polycrystals;  yet  some  models  remain  better  than  others,  also  for  overall 
properties). In contrast, the knowledge of the microscopic fields gives access to a greater number of experimentally 
testable  parameters.  For  example,  an  experimental  ODF  or  texture  function  involves  a  good  hundred  parameters 
(texture  coefficients).  A  polycrystal  model  allows  to  predict  deformation  textures,  because  it  predicts  the 
distribution of the velocity gradient among the different "grains" or crystal orientations.   
 

DEVELOPMENT OF SOME VARIATIONAL MODELS FROM THE TAYLOR MODEL 

 
One successful attempt to improve the predictions of the Taylor model was the "relaxed Taylor model", which was 
built  by  several  authors,  beginning  perhaps  with  RENOUARD  &  WINTENBERGER  [1976]  (although  they  did  not 
actually propose a polycrystal model) and HONNEFF & MECKING [1978], and ending with VAN HOUTTE

Arminjon & Imbault: On  Variational  Micro-Macro  Models and  their  Application  to  Polycrystals 

 [1982]: this model indeed provided better predictions of deformation textures than did the Taylor model, especially 
for  some  cold-rolled  f.c.c.  materials  (for  a  review,  see  VAN  HOUTTE  [1984]).  It  consists  in  leaving  some  shear 
strain-rate  components  "free"  (grain-dependent),  while  the  other  components  remain  uniform  as  in  the  Taylor 
model; for every crystal orientation, the free strain-rate components are selected so as to minimize the work-rate. 
Thus, there are several versions of the model, according to the "free" components which are considered. However, 
in  some  cases,  an  improvement  could  be  observed  only  if  the  predictions  of  several  versions  of  the  model  were 
mixed. This appeared to be due to the simplistic schematization of the strain inhomogeneity: in reality, all strain-
rate components are non-uniform (and in fact, within each grain as well) but, on the other hand, the inhomogeneity 
cannot  reach  arbitrarily  high  values-  as  is  yet  allowed to the free shear components in the relaxed Taylor model. 
Moreover,  the  "freedom"  left  to  some  components  was  justified  by  appealing  to  morphological  considerations, 
which are suggestive but not perfectly clear and which, in any case, imply that the model should be applied only 
after large proportional strains have imposed a particular ("lath" or "pancake") form to the grains. For this reason, 
FORTUNIER & DRIVER [1987] suggested a model establishing a continuous transition from the Taylor model to the 
relaxed Taylor model. This model, however, still restricts the possible forms of strain-inhomogeneity and does not 
fully  account  for  the  fact  that  this  is  detected  from  the  beginning,  as  it  must  be  since  a  homogeneous  strain  is 
mechanically impossible in a heterogeneous material. 
 
A different model was proposed by ARMINJON [1984], in which one feature of the relaxed Taylor model 
 
was conserved, i.e. the assumption that the strain-inhomogeneity obeys a principle of least energy expenditure, but 
the allowed strain-inhomogeneity was more general in form: it was only assumed that, for each grain k (k=1,...,n), 
the norm of the strain-rate tensor Dk  is the same (|Dk | = |D|) and Dk must lie within some ball centered at the overall 
strain-rate tensor D, i.e. |Dk -D| ≤α, where the number α is prescribed. ARMINJON [1987] determined the size of the 
ball  so  as  to  give  the  best  prediction  of  the  deformation  texture  for  one  deformation  process  (cold-rolling).  The 
predicted texture was in very good agreement with the observed texture for cold-rolling; moreover, the predicted 
texture (with the same ball) agreed also very well with the experimental one for all other investigated deformations. 
These results were "explained" when this model was seen to be an approximation of another one, which is more 
rigorous- and also more general, since it may be applied to any material, provided the microscopic constitutive law 
derives from a potential. In this model (ARMINJON [1991a]), the independent energy minimization for every grain is 
replaced by a minimization of the average energy rate in the material under two constraints: (i) the average strain-
rate  is  the  overall  strain-rate  D  ("consistency  condition"),  (ii)  the  average  strain-rate  inhomogeneity  h  must  not 
exceed a prescribed value r. It was proved mathematically that, for every D, it indeed exists one value r0 = r0 (D) 
such that the so-obtained average energy rate Wr0  (D) coincides with the actual overall energy rate W(D). However, 
this does not justify the hypothese that the corresponding strain-rate distribution among the different constituents 
coincides with the actual one, (Dk)k =1,...,n. It was proved by ARMINJON et al. [1994] that the latter hypothese amounts 
to assume a precise principle of minimal inhomogeneity, according to which the average inhomogeneity h of the 
actual strain-rate distribution is the least, among distributions satisfying the consistency condition (i) and leading to 
the actual overall energy rate W(D).  
 
 
This  general  model  has  been  implemented  for  fiber-reinforced  mortars,  with  few  isotropic  constituents, 
but has not been implemented for polycrystals, with many anisotropic constituents. The latter indeed did not seem 
urgent, in so far as the deformation textures were already accurately predicted with the 1984 approximate version. 
However, several observations indicate that the correct model should improve the predictions: e.g. the predictions 
of the Lankford coefficients R are not better with the approximate version than with the Taylor model. The likely 
reason for this is that, in this version, each grain separately selects the strain-rate that minimizes the energy rate in 
the  allowed  ball,  so  that  the  consistency  condition  is  not  fulfilled.  The  R  coefficients  and  the  whole  flow  rule 
depend  sensitively  on  the  shape  of  the  yield  surface,  determinable  if  one  knows  the  ratios  of  the  critical  shear 
stresses, usually assumed to be all equal to one for cubic materials. Hence they can be predicted from the texture 
function alone, thus providing an interesting test of polycrystal models, although they are overall properties. 
 

A NEW ALGORITHM FOR THE INHOMOGENEOUS VARIATIONAL MODEL 

 
We envisage an aggregate with a finite number of constituents (zones with constant state, e.g. grains with given 
orientation), k=1,...,n, as will be the case in computational practice. However, continuous distributions of the states 
should rather be the generic case for a statistically homogeneous material (ARMINJON [1991a]). So the formulation 
should account for the fact that the finite number n is the result of a discretization which may have to be refined so 

Arminjon & Imbault: On  Variational  Micro-Macro  Models and  their  Application  to  Polycrystals 

as  to  better  approximate  the  continuous  variation.  Let  us  first  state  the  "inhomogeneity  constraint",      h  ≤  r  ,  in 
accordance  with  this  requirement.  The  inhomogeneity  h  of  a  distribution  of  the  possible  strain  rates  D*k    in  the 
different constituents, is defined as the pth-power average deviation of this distribution:

with fk  the volume fraction of constituent k. The number p ≥ 1 is not arbitrary, at least in the theoretical proofs 
(ARMINJON  [1991a]):  there  it  is  determined  with  consideration  of  the  behavior  of  the  potential  on  straight  lines 
D=λ  D0.  In  particular,  for  rate-independent  plasticity,  the  potential  is  the  work  rate  which  is  a  homogeneous 
function of the strain-rate, and only p = 1 meets the conditions used in the proofs. In that case, one thus should not, 
strictly speaking, identify h with the standard deviation (which corresponds to p = 2), as was occasionnally done 
for the purpose of simplicity in previous work. The consistency condition means that the average strain-rate, D* in 
eqn  (1),  is  assigned  to  be  equal  to  the  overall  strain-rate  D.  It  is  simply  accounted  for  if  the  variable  Y  in  the 
minimization problem is defined to be the sequence Y = (D*k)k  =1,...,n  -1 , thus expressing the strain-rate in the last 
constituent as

Since the work rate functions Wk  of the constituents are convex, so is the function to be minimized, i.e. the average

But  the  Wk    (D*k)  functions  are  not  strictly  convex,  because  each  one  is  homogeneous,  hence  linear  on  straight 
lines D*k = λ D0 (λ ≥ 0); so F is not strictly convex. In the same way, h(Y)p is a convex function and it is strictly 
convex  if  p>1.  The  optimization  problem  is:  find  Y0  making  F  (Y)  a  minimum,  among  the  Y  's  satisfying  the 
constraint C(Y)≡ h(Y)p  - rp  ≤ 0. The saddle point theorem characterizes the solutions of this problem as follows:

Hence, unless λ=0 i.e. unless r is so large (r ≥ rS ) that the solution is that of the problem without constraint (which 
corresponds  to  the  "static"  model),  then  any  solution  satisfies  the  equality  constraint  C(Y)=0  i.e.  belongs  to  the 
boundary of the convex set C  = {Y; C(Y) ≤ 0}, furthermore the normal to C  is also normal to the contour levels 
of F. As a consequence, if at least one of the two functions F and C is strictly convex, thus if p>1, then the solution 
Y0  is  unique.  Moreover,  even  if  none  is  strictly  convex,  thus  even  if  p=1,  the  non-uniqueness  of  the  solution  is 
likely to be an exceptional case. Unless r is larger than the "static" value rS , the numerical solution is searched as 
the solution of the problem with "penalized" equality constraint: 
 

F 1  (Y) ≡ F (Y) + Fρ (Y) = Min,   Fρ (Y) ≡ ρ C(Y)2 , 

 ρ >>1,   

           (6) 

 
and this solution is unique in any case. The gradient of F 1 involves the derivatives of F, which are easy to express 
in terms of those of the Wk  functions, i.e. the associated stresses:

In passing, eqn (7) shows clearly that the minimum of the average work rate F without inhomogeneity constraint 
(∂F  /  ∂  D*k    =  0)  indeed  corresponds  to  the  "static"  model,  i.e.  to  the  case  where  the  stress  tensors  in  all 
constituents k are (assumed to be) the same. It also implies that the second derivatives (making the Hessian matrix) 
are  only  numerically  accessible,  which  led  us  to  select  the  conjugate  gradient  method  as  the  minimization 
algorithm for solving (6), instead of a quasi-Newton method like the BFGS method which was used by ARMINJON 
et al. [1994]. Moreover, these second derivatives are often irregular at points Y involving at least one D*k
  which is 
normal to the corresponding yield surface (Σk ) at a straight-line portion of  (Σk ), and are zero at vertices [that is, 
the stress tensor remains constant as long as the strain-rate lies within a cone of normals to (Σk )]. This also forbids 
the  use  of  the  Newton  method  even  for  unidirectional  mimization  in  a  known  "descent"  direction:  therefore,  a 
dichotomy is used for unidirectional minimization. Thus the usual Schmid law once more creates difficulties. For 
this  optimization  problem,  the  regular  form  proposed  by  ARMINJON  [1991b] and by GAMBIN [1991] is probably 
preferable, and perhaps its physical content is not worse than that of Schmid's law.

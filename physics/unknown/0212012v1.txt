On the basis of the data given in the works of different authors a criterion of 

phase-photometric method of measurement of energy angle of divergence has been 

formulated. Validity of application of the obtained relations for a ray beam with an 

arbitrary  diameter  and  an  arbitrary  shape  of  the  wave  front  has  been  proved. 

Advantages  of  the  proposed  phase-photometric  method  in  comparison  with  the 

focal-spot  method  have  been  confirmed.Necessity  and  possibility  of  building  a 

standard solid angle has been proved. 

Development  of  laser  engineering  requires  elaboration  of  new  methods  for 

measuring  the  parameters  of  laser  beams.  Any  measurement  is  connected  with 

finding  the  numeric  magnitudes  of  physical  values  by  means  of  which  the 

regularities of the investigated phenomena are revealed. In other words, to measure 

a value is to find its quantitative relation to another similar value taken as standard. 

The  result  of  the  measurement,  with  a  certain  degree  of  reliability  can  be 

represented as quantitative information about the qualitative state of the measured 

object, obtained as the result of a physical experiment. 

The  basic  mean  of  maintaining  the  unity  of  measurements  is  reproduction 

and  storage  of  the  units  of  measurement  with  the  help  of  standards  (of  mass, 

length, time, roughness, etc.). Transmission of magnitudes from the standard to the 

2

 

 

 

 

operating  measuring  tools  is  accomplished  with  the  help  of  fixed  verifying 

schemes. Creation of the standards of physical values is an important scientific and 

technical task. For example, the State Standard of the Unit of Plane Angle (Radian) 

is a complex aggregate consisting of a 36-facet prism, a precise mechanism of its 

turning, and a  goniometric device which  includes photoelectronic autocollimators 

[1]). The error of plane angle reproduction is 0,02". 

The  International  System  of  Units  (SI)  includes,  as  an  additional  unit,  the 

measure  of  solid  angle (cid:150)  steradian  (sr).  It  is  used  in  solving  problems  of 

photometry. Steradian is a solid angle, with the vertex in the centre of the sphere, 

cutting out on the surface of the sphere an area equal to the area of a square with 

the side equal to the radius of the sphere. At the same time there is no standard of 

reproduction of solid angle so far. Therefore solid angle has to be calculated on the 

basis of plane angle measurements, which causes additional errors. 

For  this  purpose  the  following  relation  between  solid  angle  Ω  and  plane 

angle θ is used, known from stereometry: 

 

Ω = 2π(1 − cos θ/2)                                             (1) 

In  measuring  the  elementary  angles  which  make  a  plane  angle  three 

assumptions, considerably simplifying the real picture, are made: 

1.  The  vertexes  of  all  elementary  angles  are  situated  in  one  point  which  is  the 

vertex of the plane angle. 

2. The arcs bounding the angles are replaced by corresponding spans. 

3. The duration of emission is big enough to take measurements of all elementary 

angles. 

In  reality,  however,  the  first  two  conditions  are  not  fulfilled  for  a  finite-

extent  (not  punctual)  emitting  object.  The  third  condition  does  not  take  place  for 

pulsing  sources  of  emission.  Therefore  the  measurement  procedure  must  provide 

reliable measurement of instantaneous values of angles.  

At the present time the most widespread method of solid angle measurement 

is  the  focal-spot  method.  [2].  However,  by  this  method  not  the  angle  itself  is 

measured,  but  the  energy  distribution  as  a  function  of  a  section  of  the  ray  beam

received  in the  focal plane of the objective. For this  purpose the  measurement of 

the  maximum  in  the  distribution  is  taken,  and,  in  relation  to  this  maximum,  an 

energy  level  is  chosen  on  which  the  diameter  of  the  focal  spot  is  measured. 

Thereby an additional error is caused by the subjectivity of the estimation. 

The main advantage of this method is a possibility of taking measurements 

only in on plane, that is, in the focal one. The main disandvantage of the method is 

the  necessity  to  use objectives with  large  focal distance (teleobjectives) to obtain 

focal spots accessible  for  measurements. Besides, this  method  is characterized by 

difficulty  of  finding  the  sign  of  the  divergence  of  the  beam,  since  both  spots 

(before  and  behind  the  focus)  are  of  similar  shape  and  size.  Therefore  a  new 

method  is  proposed  below,  the  so  called  phase-photometric  method  of  formation 

and  measurement of both plane and solid angles. To a great extent this method is 

free of the disadvantages mentioned above. As follows from Fig. 1, the angle of the 

beam divergence is determined by relation (2):

where R is the radius of curvature of the wave front, ∆ is the sag of the wave front.

As follows from relation (5), the solid angle value is completely determined 

by  two  parameters  d  and  R.  These  parameters  can  be  found  by  means  of  high-

precision  methods  of  laser  interference  [2].  Thereby  it  has  been  proved  that 

practical creation of solid angle standard is possible. 

Summarizing all above-stated, the following conclusions can be made: 

1.  On  the  basis  of  the  data  given  in  the  works  of  different  authors  [2,  3]  a 

criterion  of  phase-photometric  method  of  measurement  of  energy  angle  of 

divergence has been formulated. 

2.  Validity  of  application  of  the  obtained  relations  for  a  ray  beam  with  an 

arbitrary diameter and an arbitrary shape of the wave front has been proved. 

3.  Advantages  of  the  proposed  phase-photometric  method  in  comparison 

with the focal-spot method have been confirmed. 

4.  Necessity  and  possibility  of  building  a  standard  solid  angle  has  been 

proved.

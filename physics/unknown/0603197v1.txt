Abstract.  

The  imminent  “when”  earthquake’s  predictions  are  based  on  the  correlation  between 

geomagnetic  quakes  and  the  incoming  minimum  (or  maximum)  of  tidal  gravitational 

potential. The probability time window for the incoming earthquake is for the tidal minimum 

approximately ± 1 day and for the maximum- ± 2 days. The statistic evidence for reliability is 

based on of distributions of the time difference between occurred and predicted earthquakes 

for the period 2002- 2005 for Sofia region and 2004- 2005 for Skopje.  

The project for complex Balkan- Black Sea region NETWORK for earthquake prediction by 

using  the  reliable  precursors  will  be  proposed  in  near  future.  The  Project  is  based  on  the 

temporary  data  acquisition  system  for  preliminary  archiving,  testing,  visualizing  and 

analyzing of the data with aim to prepare regional daily risk estimation.

Introduction 

The problem of “when, where and how” earthquake prediction can’t be solved only on the 

basis of seismic and geodetic data (Aki, 1995; Pakiser and Shedlock, 1995; Geller et al., 1997, 

Main, 1999a,b; Ludwin, 2001).

The  possible  tidal  trigging  of  the  earthquakes  has  been  investigated  for  a  long  period  of 

time (Knopoff, 1964; Tamrazyan, 1967; Tamrazyan, 1968; Ryabl at al., 1968; Shlien, 1972; 

Molher,  1980;  Sounau  et  al.,  1982;  Shirley,  1988;  Bragin,  1999).  The  conclusion  that  the 

earthquake’s time is correlated with the tidal extremums is not unique, because in some of the 

extremums there are not earthquakes.  

The including of additional information in the monitoring, for example, the analysis of the 

Earth  electrical  currents  signals,  permits  to  estimate  the  most  probable  time  of  incoming 

earthquake (Thanassoulas, 1991, Thanassoulas et al., 2001a, b). 

The more accurate space and time measuring set for the Earth’s crust condition parameters, 

the  including  in  the  monitoring  of  the  electromagnetic  fields  measurements  under,  on  and 

over  the  Earth  surface,  the  temperature  distribution  and  other  possible  precursors  can  be 

useful for the study of the “when, where and how” earthquake’s prediction. For example in 

the papers (Varotsos and Alexopoulos, 1984a, b; Varotsos at al., 1996; Geller, R. J., 1996), 

the possibility for short-term earthquake prediction in Greece by seismic electric signals was 

investigated  and  analyzed.  The  results  of  observations  on  seismo-electromagnetic  waves  at 

two earthquake experimental areas in China were presented in the paper of Qian at al., 1994. 

The atmospheric and ionospheric electromagnetic phenomena associated with earthquakes 

were analyzed in many books and papers (Hayakawa and Fujinawa, 1994; Hayakawa et al., 

1999,  Hayakawa  et  al.,  2000,  Hayakawa  and  Molchanov,  2002)  and  the  future  direction  of 

investigation  related  to  earthquake  prediction  was  proposed,  as  well  as  its  practical 

application to some concrete events. The papers (Oike and Ogawa, 1982, 1994) concern the 

observations  of  electromagnetic  radiation  in  the  LF  and  VLF  ranges  related  with  the 

occurrence  of  earthquake.  The  results  of  complex  investigation  of  the  variations  of  crust 

electrical  resistivity  as  a  function  of  tidal  deformations  on  the  basis  of  extremely  low 

frequency radio station, which permit the hope for increase the reliability of electromagnetic 

based earthquake prediction, are presented in paper of Saraev et al., 2002.  

Evidence in papers (Eftaxias, 2001, 2002) is presented that electromagnetic anomalyties in 

wide  range  of  radio  frequencies  from  ULF,  VLF  to  VHF  have  been  observed  before  some 

destructive earthquakes in continental Greece.  

The  impressive  results  of  modified  VAN  method  are  presented  in  papers  and  web  site 

(Thanassoulas,  1991,  1999;  Thanassoulas  et  al.,  2001  a,  b,  c,  d),  where,  the  appropriate 

measuring  of  electric  Earth  signals  and  their  analysis  demonstrates  that  the  direction  to  the 

 

2

epicenter  of  incoming  earthquake  can  be  estimated  and  the  time  is  defined  from  the  next 

extremum  of  tidal  potential.  Some  possible  geophysical  models  of  the  phenomena  are 

proposed and the prediction of the future magnitude is analyzed. The including of more than 

one  site  in  the  monitoring  will  permit  short  term  earthquake  prediction  and  will  give  some 

estimation for the magnitude (Thanassoulas, 1999). 

In  web  site  (ws)  (Ustundag,  2001)  and  papers  cited  there,  are  presented  the  results  of 

electropotential  monitoring,  based  on  the  special  constructed  electrometer  and  appropriate 

temporal data acquisition system, for researching the electropotential variations as earthquake 

precursor. 

One  has  to  mention  the  satellite  possibilities  for  monitoring  the  radiation  activity  of  the 

Earth surface for discovering the radiation variations (ws Dean, 2003), temperature anomalies 

(Ramesh,  2004)  and  earthquake  clouds  (Zhonghao  Shou,  1999,  2005)  which  can  serve  as 

earthquake precursors. 

The  analyses  of  the  data  from  satellite  monitoring  for  the  ionosphere  and  the  Earth 

radiation  belt  parameters  also  give  evidences  for  anomalyties  which  can  be  interpreted  as 

earthquake  precursors.  The  information  for  the  some  results  from  the  developing  of 

earthquake precursor research could be found in the conference sites: Contadakis, 2002 and 

Papadopoulos, 2003. 

The  data  for  the  connection  between  incoming  earthquake  and  meteorology  effects  like 

quasistationary  earthquakes  clouds  can  be  seen  in  the  site  of  Zhonghao  Shou,  1999.  The 

statistic  from  1993  for  the  reliability  of  prediction  is  also  represented  together  with  some 

theoretical models and estimations for the effect. 

In order to summarize the results we can say, that the standard geodetic monitoring (USGS 

Pf,  ws,  2002;  Pakiser  L,  Shedlock  K.M.,  1995),  the  monitoring  of  different  component  of 

electromagnetic  field  under,  on  and  over  the  Earth  surface,  some  of  the  atmospheric 

anomalyties and behavior of charge distribution in the Earth radiation belts (see for example 

Silina,  2001;  Larkina  and  Ruzhin,  2003),  sometime  could  serve  as  unique  earthquake’s 

precursor. It is obvious, that for solving the reliability problem all different approaches should 

be unified, including the biological precursor data. 

The  progress 

in  geomagnetic  quake  earthquake  precursor  approach  (Mavrodiev, 

Thanassoulas, 2001) is presented (Mavrodiev, 2002 a, b, 2003 a, b, c; Mavrodiev, 2004). The 

 

3

approach  is  based  on  the  understanding  that  earthquake  processes  have  a  complex  origin. 

Without  creating  of  adequate  physical  model  of  the  Earth  existence,  the  gravitational  and 

electromagnetic interactions, which ensure the stability of the Sun system and its planets for a 

long  time,  the  earthquake  prediction  problem  can not  be  solved.  The  earthquake  part  of  the 

model  can  be  repeated  in  the  infinity  way  “theory-  experiment-theory”  using  nonlinear 

inverse problem methods looking for the correlations between fields in dynamically changed 

space  and  time  scales.  Of  course,  every  approximate  model  (see  for  example  Thanassoulas, 

1991;  Thanassoulas  et  al.,  2001a,  b)  which  has  some  experimental  evidence  has  to  be 

included  in  the  analysis.  It  seems  obvious  that  the  problem  of  adequate  physical 

understanding  of  the  correlations  between  electromagnetic  precursors,  tidal  extremums  and 

incoming  earthquake  is  connected  with  the  progress  of  the  adequate  Earth’s  magnetism 

theory. 

The achievement of the Earth’s surface tidal potential modeling, which includes the ocean 

and  atmosphere  tidal  influences,  is  an  essential  part  of  the  research.  In  this  sense  the 

comparison  of  the  Earth  tides  analysis  programs  (Dierks  and  Neumeyer,  ws)  for  the 

ANALYZE  from  the  ETERNA-package,  version  3.30  (Wenzel,  1996  a,  b),  program 

BAYTAP-G  in  the  version  from  15.11.1999  (Tamura,  1991),  Program  VAV  (version  from 

April 2002) of Venedikov et al, 2001, 2003 is very useful.  

The  role  of  geomagnetic  variations  as  precursor  could  be  explained  by  the  obvious 

hypothesis  that  during  the  time  before  the  earthquakes,  with  the  strain,  deformation  or 

displacement  changes  in  the  crust,  in  some  interval  of  density  changing  arise  the  chemical 

phase  shift  which  leads  to  an  electrical  charge  shift.  The  preliminary  Fourier  analysis  of 

geomagnetic  field  gives  the  time  period  of  alteration  in  minute  scale.  Such  specific 

geomagnetic  variation  we  call  geomagnetic  quake.  The  linear  piezo-  effect  model  for 

electrical  currents,  which  produce  such  geomagnetic  variations,  can  not  explain  the 

alternations.  The  results  from  laboratory  researching  of  electromagnetic  effects  in  stress 

conditions can serve as qualitative support of the quantum mechanic phase shift explanation 

for  mechanism  generating 

the  geomagnetic  quake  before  earthquake  and  others 

electromagnetic  phenomena  in  the  time  of  earthquake  (Freund  et  al,  2002;  St-Laurent  et  al, 

2006) 

 

The K-index (Balch, 2003), accepted for the estimation of the geomagnetic conditions, can 

not  indicate  well  the  local  geomagnetic  variation  for  time  minutes  period,  because  it  is 

4

calculated as a first moment of the geomagnetic filed on the basis of 3-h data. Nevertheless, 

the K- index behavior in the near space has to be analyzed, because of the possible Sun wind 

influence on the local behavior of the geomagnetic filed. 

 If  the  field  components  are  measured  many  times  per  second,  one  can  calculate  the 

frequency dependence of full geomagnetic intensity and to analyze the frequency spectrum of 

geomagnetic quake. If the variations are bigger than usual for some period of time, one can 

say  that  we  have  the  geomagnetic  quake,  which  is  the  earthquake  precursor.  The  nonlinear 

inverse problem analysis for 1999- 2001 of geomagnetic and earthquake data for Sofia region 

gives  the  estimation,  that  the  probability  time  window  for  the  predicted  earthquake  (event, 

events) is approximately ± 1 day for the minimum Earth the tidal potential and ± 2 days for 

the maximum. 

The future epicenter coordinates could be estimated from the data from at least 3 points of 

measuring  the  geomagnetic  vector,  using  the  inverse  problem  methods,  applied  for  the 

estimation the coordinates of the volume, where the phase shift arrived in the framework of its 

time window. For example the first work hypothesis can be that the main part of geomagnetic 

quake is generated from the vertical Earth Surface- Ionosphere electrical current.  

In  the  case  of  incoming  big  earthquake  (magnitude  >  5  -  6)  the  changes  of  vertical 

electropotential  distribution,  the  Earth’s  temperature,  the  infrared  Earth’s  radiation,  the 

behavior  of  water  sources,  its  chemistry  and  radioactivity,  the  atmosphere  conditions 

(earthquakes  clouds,  etc.)  and  the  charge  density  of  the  Earth  radiation  belt,  have  to  be 

dramatically changed near the epicenter area.  

The achievements of tidal potential modeling of the Earth’s surface, including ocean and 

atmosphere  tidal  influences,  multi-  component  correlation  analysis  and  nonlinear  inverse 

problem methods in fluids dynamics and electrodynamics are crucial for every single step of 

the constructing of the mathematical and physical models.  

In Sect 2 are given the statistics evidences for the reliability of the time window earthquake 

prediction  on  the  basis  of  the  geomagnetic  field  measurements  (Mavrodiev,  2002b)  and  the 

Earth tidal behavior (Venedikov at al., 2002) for Sofia region (2002-2005) and for Skopje one 

(2004-2005)

2.  The  geomagnetic  field  quake  as  a  reliable  imminent  time  window  earthquake’s 

precursors for Balkan, Black Sea region- Sofia, Skopje data 

As  a  support  for  complex  approach  it  is  useful  to  stress  that  the  author’s  interests  to  the 

earthquake’s  prediction  problem  arise  as  a  result  of  complex  research  of  the  Black  Sea 

ecosystem  about  15-  20  years  ago  (Mavrodiev,  1998).  During  the  time  of  gathering  the 

historical data for the ecosystem, was observed, that the Crime earthquake, occurred in 1928, 

is  an  evidence  for  electromagnetic  and  earthquake  correlations.  Such  hypothesis  has  been 

proposed  by  the  academician  Popov  in  the  early  30-ties  of  the  20  century  (private 

communication). 

According the INTERMAGNET (Geomagnetic data, 1986) requirements for measuring the 

geomagnetic field (see Fig. 1) on Earth’s surface (http://www.intermagnet.org), the accuracy 

is  ±10  nT  for  95%  of  reported  data  and  ±  5  nT  for  definitive  data,  with  one  sample  per  5 

seconds, in the case of vector magnetometer (F (XYZ) or F (HDZ)) and 1 nT, with 3 samples 

per second, for Scalar Magnetometer (F). 

In  Sofia,  the  geomagnetic  vector  projection  H  is  measured  with  relative  accuracy  less  or 

equal to 1 nT by a fluxgate, feedback based device of rather original and simple, but powerful 

construction. (know-how of JINR, Dubna, Boris Vasiliev, 1998, private communication). It is 

used with 2.4 samples per second. Due to technical reasons the sensor was oriented under the 

Horizon in a manner that the measured value of H is around 20 000 nT. 

Analyzing  the  correlations  between  the  behavior  of  the  geomagnetic  field,  Earth  tidal 

gravitational potential and the occurred earthquakes (from 1999 to 2001) it turns out that the 

daily averaged value of σHm and σΔHm, which we denote by Sig ((cid:31)Sig), is playing the role of 

earthquake precursor. 

Fig. 1 illustrates the behavior of geomagnetic field component Hm and its variation σHm for 
a period without earthquakes precursor in the region. Figs 2 and 3 illustrate the behavior of 
geomagnetic  field  and  its  variation,  which  is  unusual.  Is  this  cases  there  are  a  geomagnetic 
quake,  which  is  precursor  for  incoming  event  (earthquake  or  earthquakes)?    One  has  to  be 
sure that there are not a cosmos or Sun wind reasons for the geomagnetic quake (ws [NOAA, 
1972].

The  preliminary  Fourier  analysis  of  Hm  data  gives  the  fact  that  the  bigger  geomagnetic 

variations  are  caused  from  the  arriving  for  hours  time  period  new  frequencies  with  periods 

from 10-th of seconds till 10-th of minutes and with very specific amplitude behavior. Such 

spectrum, which arrives for hour period of time, is invisible for minute samples measuring. Its 

almost  real  time  Fourier  analysis  is  very  complicated  and  there  are  some  digital  evidences, 

that the arrived electromagnetic field can not a linear piezo effect explanation.  

The probability time window of the incoming event (or events) is defined by the next date 

of the Earth tidal potential extremum with tolerance approximately for the tidal minimum ± 1 

day and for the maximum ± 2 days- Fig. 6. 

The  uncertainty  of  distinguishing  the  predicted  event  (or  group  of  events  –  for  example 

aftershocks)  from  the  events  which  occurred  in  the  region  at  different  distances  and 

magnitudes in the predicted time window is solved on the basis of inverse problem methods 

with new earthquake’s influence characteristic function SChtM: 

SChtM = 10M/(Req+Distance)2, Req=0.40+Depth [hundred km]   (1) 

 

The physical sense of the function SChtM is that it is proportionally to the density distribution 

on  the  Earth  surface  of  earthquake’s  energy.  It  is  important  to  point  out  that  the  first 

8

consideration  of  the  magnitude  and  distance  dependences  was  obtained  on  the  basis  of 

nonlinear inverse problem methods. Obviously, the nearer and biggest earthquake (relatively 

biggest  value  of  SChtM)  will  bear  more  electropotential  variations,  which  will  generate  more 

power geomagnetic quake which depends on the depth and geology.  

At  this  stage  of  the  study,  as  a  measure  of  daily  geomagnetic  state  serve  the  value  of 

averaged for 24 hours (1440 minutes) standard deviation σHm- the signal function Sig and its 

error δSig are  

Sig = Σm=1,M σHm/M, δSig = Σm=1,M δσHm/M,        

 

(2) 

 

 

 

where σΗμ

 is the standard deviation 

σΗμ = sqrt Σι=1,Ν (Ηι−Ημ)2/Ν,  δσΗμ =sqrt Σι=1,Ν (δΗι−δΗμ)2/Ν, 

Hm  is  minute  average  value  of  geomagnetic  vector  projection  Hi,  measured  2.4  times  per 

second, N= 140, M= 1440: 

Ημ= Σι=1,Ν Ηι/Ν, δΗμ= Σι=1,Ν δΗι/Ν, 

the minutes per day are M=1440, and samples per minute are N=144. 

The numerical definition of geomagnetic quake is the condition (3) 

SigToday – SigYesterday  >  |δSigToday + δSigYesterday | / 2,    (3) 

 

 

 

where δSig  is the error of Sig. 

If criteria (3) are fulfilled and there are not a Cosmos and Sun generated variations of the 

geomagnetic field one has to conclude that the geomagnetic quake is precursor for incoming 

earthquake.  In  the  next  minimum  or  maximum  of  the  local  tidal  gravitational  potential 

somewhere in the region this predicted earthquake will occur. 

 

9

For some of the cases, the criteria (3) have to be calculated for decades of hours or ten’s of 

minutes. 

hours. 

The  signal  for  earthquakes  with  different  epicenters  we  observe  in  the  case  when  the 

specific behavior of field and its standard deviation occurs more than ones per day in different 

The  analysis  of  the  precursor  function  Sig  on  the  basis  of  special  digital  5  points 

derivatives can serve in the future for creating the algorithm for automated alert system. 

It is next the more detailed time window can be achieved by analyzing the daily variations 

of tidal potential, calculated every 3 hours (see for example the definition of K- index).  

At this stage of the study all earthquakes have the same SChtM for different definitions of 

the  magnitude.  After  the  developing  of  mathematical  models  of  empirical  and  theoretical 

dependences between incoming earthquake processes, geomagnetic quake and parameters of 

earthquake on the basis of inverse nonlinear problem we will obtain a set of SChtM functions in 

correspondence  with  the  different  definition  of  magnitude  and  in  correspondence  with  the 

earthquake’s  energy.  The earthquake volume parameters, its depth, chemical and geological 

structures of the region have to be included in the dependences as well. 

Fig.  4  illustrates  the  possibility  for  registration  of  big  world  earthquakes  with  magnitude 

greater than 6 by specific behavior of the geomagnetic change which has a place in about 60 

% of the cases in monitoring period. The researching of this correlation will give information 

on the global Earth electric current distribution and its dependences on Sun wind variations.

In the next Fig.5 up to down the daily and hour behavior of the tidal potential, earthquake’s 

energy density SChtM, magnitude, distance from Sofia (vertical lines from the magnitude) and

Fig7.  The  distribution  of  difference  between  predicted  time  and  the  time  of  occurred 

earthquakes   for 6, 12, 18,…, 42 months (the illustration of realibility by comparison between 

time difference distributions for all occured and predicted earthquakes with the time of tidal 

extremums). 

 

In  Fig.  7,  left  the  distributions  of  the  difference  between  the  times  of  predicted  events, 

which  occurred,  calculated  for  6,  12,  18,…,  42  months  (starting  from  January,  2002),  are 

presented. The distribution growth, without widening and its approximation to the Gaussian 

distribution with the time, is an argument for the causality-consequences origin between the 

correlation  geomagnetic  quake  -  tidal  potential  extremum  and  occurred  earthquake.  The 

number  of  earthquakes  in  Fig.  7,  left  is  greater  than  the  number  of  the  predictions  for  the 

events. The explanation of this is that some earthquakes with greater magnitude are following 

by aftershocks. In Fig. 7, right, are presented the same distributions, but for the all occurred in 

the  region  (500  km)  earthquakes.  The  difference  illustrates  the  answer  of  the  statement  for 

“100%  true  predictions”,  which  is  based  on  the  distances  dependence  of  the  signal  for 

geomagnetic quake. 

The  fact,  that  the  distributions  of  time  differences  between  the  tidal  exstremum  and  all 

earthquakes, occurred in the same Tidal period, are flatter than the distributions of predicted 

earthquakes, can be consider as evidence that the correlation between geomagnetic quake and 

tidal extremum in the framework of physical mean of function SChtM is a reliable precursor- 

Fig.8.

Fig.8.  Left:  the  comparison  of  the  distributions  of  the  difference  between  tidal  extremums’ 

time and the time of the predicted (solid curves) and all (dotted) occurred earthquakes for 6,

and the time of all occurred earthquakes for 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. 

Next, Fig. 9 expresses the obvious fact that the incoming earthquake with grater magnitude 

can  be  predicted  at  greater  distances.  Nowadays  estimation  is  that  bigger  earthquakes 

(magnitude>5) could be predicted for distances till 500- 600 km.

In the Fig 18. are presented the distributions of the time difference between predicted 

and  occurred  earthquakes  with  magnitude  greater  then  3,  SChtM  greater  then  200  for  the 

region 500 km from Skopje and Sofia, correspondingly.  The displacement of the Skopje peak 

from  zero  to  one  is  connected  with  aftershocks  and  the  high  seismicity  in  Greece.  The 

classification of the predicted earthquakes and their aftershocks is one nonsolved problem in 

our approach. After its solution will be possible to estimate more precisely the estimation of 

incoming time risk period- +/-1 day for the daily tidal minimum and +/-2 days for daily tidal 

maximum.

The  distance  sensibility  of  the  approach  as  function  of  magnitude  and  distances  is 

illustrated in the maps (Fig. 19,20, 21.) for earthquakes with magnitude greater then 5, 4 and 3 

for  the  predicted  earthquakes  in  the  500  km  region.  The  reconstruction  of  the  sensibility 

function is not performed because of indeterminations connected with the fact that the used 

magnetometers  are  different.  The  problem  of  its  reconstruction  will  be  possible  after 

analyzing  the  geomagnetic  monitoring  data  (at  least  3  points!)  for  the  “when,  where”

The confirmation of one geomagnetic component Sofia data from the vector Skopje results 

for reliability time window earthquake prediction can be consider as a first step for solution of 

“when, where and how” earthquake prediction at level “when”. It is obvious that the occurred 

in the predicted time period earthquake with maximum value of function SChtM (proportional 

to the Richter energy density in the monitoring point) is the predicted earthquake. But some 

times there are more then one geomagnetic signals in one day or some in different days. It is 

not possible to perform unique interpretation and to choose the predicted earthquakes between 

some  of  them  with  less  values  of  energy  density.  The  solution  of  this  problem  will  be  the 

vector  geomagnetic  monitoring  in  at  least  3  points,  which  will  permit  to  start  solving  the 

inverse  problem  for  estimation  the  coordinates  of  geomagnetic  quake  source  as  function  of 

geomagnetic quake. The numbering of powers of freedom for estimation the epicenter, depth, 

magnitude  and  intensity  (maximum  values  of  accelerator  vector  and  its  dangerous 

frequencies) and the number of possible earthquake precursors show that the nonlinear system 

of inverse problem will be overdeterminated.  

Thus, the first prove, that in the framework of such complex approach, the “when, where 

and how” earthquake prediction problem can be solve will be the “when, where” prediction 

on  the  basis  of  at  least  3  points  for  electromagnetic  real  time  monitoring  is  essential.  If  the 

statistic estimation will be successful for a long enough period of time (6-12 months) and the 

established  correlations  are  confirmed  by  the  adequate  physical  model  solutions,  one  could 

say that the earthquake prediction problem is under solving using the electromagnetic quake 

precursor. 

Experimentally, the first attempts for estimation of the future epicenter can be perform on 

the  basis  of  isolines  distribution  of  geomagnetic  quake  and  electropotential  data  set. 

Theoretically,  the  simplest  inverse  problem  is  to  estimate  the  coordinates  of  vertical  Earth 

surface – Ionosphere electrical current which generates the geomagnetic quake. Such time of 

modeling has to be perform step by step by including the volume of solid state phase shifts 

and frequency characteristics like function of stress, depth and geology.      

The  posteriori  analysis  for  England,  Alaska,  India,  Kamchatka,  Hokkaido  regions  on  the 

basis of second vector Intermagnet data [INTERMAGNET, WS], also confirm the reliability 

of geomagnetic quake as imminent earthquake precursors (Mavrodiev 2003 a, b, 2004). 

 

 

3. Conclusion  

22

 

 

The  correlations  between  the  local  geomagnetic  quake  and  incoming  earthquakes,  which 

occur in the time window defined from tidal minimum (± 1 day) or maximum (± 2 days) of 

the  Earth  tidal  gravitational  potential  are  tested  statistically.  The  distribution  of  the  time 

difference between predicted and occurred events is going to be Gaussian with the increasing 

of the statistics. 

This result can be interpreted as first reliable approach for solving the “when” earthquakes 

prediction problem using the geomagnetic data.

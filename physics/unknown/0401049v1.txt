Abstract. The relativistic and quantum theoretical explanations of the 

magnetic moment anomaly of the electron (or proton) show that it is a 

complicated function of the fine structure constant. In this work, a 

simple non-relativistic approach shows that the translational motion of 

the particle during its spin is responsible for the observed effects. 

 

 

Key words: anomalous magnetic moment, spin, fine structure 

constant, translational motion during spin, electron radius 

The magnetic moment anomaly (ae) of an electron (or ap for a proton) 

concerns the observed higher value (µe) for a free electron (or µp for a 

proton) than the expected value equal to the Bohr magneton (µB) (or 

µN, the nuclear magneton for the proton). An introduction to the topic 

and the bibliography can be found in [1]. The relativistic and quantum 

theoretical explanations given suggest that the anomaly is a function 

of the fine structure constant. In this work, a simple non-relativistic 

approach shows that the translational motion of the particle during its 

spin is responsible for the higher magnetic momenta of the particles.  

    

 

 

 

 

 

    For the case of an electron (subscript e), (note: all equations hold 

for a proton with subscript p in place of e) 

µe = (ge/2)µB = (1 + ae)µB > µB                                                          (1) 

where (ge/2) ( >1) is the anomalous g-factor for the electron and µB, 

the Bohr magneton is given by,  

µB = (ħe/2me)                                                                                    (2a) 

    [= (e2/κvω)(e/2me) = (ec/2π)(λC,e/2)] = (ec/2)re                            (2b)               

where ħ = h/2π = e2/καc, κ = 4πεο is the electrical permittivity of 

vacuum and α is the fine structure constant. The equivalent terms 

introduced here in the square brackets consist of ħ = e2/κvω, the 

angular momentum of spin and vω = αc, the velocity of spin (as a 

result of the torque due to electric and magnetic fields [2]), the 

Compton wavelength,

λC,e = h/mec = de = (2πe

/κvωmec) = 2πre                                          (3)

equal to the distance de = 2πre, re = e

/κvωmec = ħ/mec, considered 

here as the radius of the electron and Iω = ħ/c = mere, the rotational 

moment of inertia. Thus de is the distance a point on the circumference 

of the electron would cover during one spin of the electron around an 

axis through its center. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     Equation (1) can therefore be written as, 

µe = ħγ [= (ge/2)(e2/κvω)(e/2me)                                                       (4a) 

     = (ec/2π)(de,f/2)] = (ge/2)(ec/2)re]                                               (4b)         

where γe = (ge/2)(e/2me) is the gyromagnetic ratio [1] of the electron, 

and the distance de,f is given by,  

2
de,f  = (ge/2)de = de + δde = (1 + ae)(2πe

/κvωmec)                             (5) 

where δde is the translational displacement of the electron during its 

spin. Thus, the g-factor and the magnetic moment anomaly stand 

respectively for, 

(ge/2) = (1 + ae) = de,f/de = (1 + δde/de)                                              (6) 

ae = δde/de                                                                                          (7) 

where de depends on the fine structure constant, see equation (3).

Abstract 

    A high-altitude nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) with a peak field intensity of 
5 x 104 V/m carries momentum that results in a retarding force on the average 
Compton electron (radiating coherently to produce the waveform) with magnitude 

near that of the geomagnetic force responsible for the coherent radiation. The 

retarding force results from a self-field effect. The Compton electron interaction with 

the self-generated magnetic field due to the other electrons accounts for the 

momentum density in the propagating wave; interaction with the self-generated 

electric field accounts for the energy-flux density in the propagating wave. Coherent 

addition of radiation is also quantitatively modeled. 

INTRODUCTION 

Electrons propagating in air can radiate an associated electromagnetic pulse 

(EMP).[1]  Over two decades ago, Conrad Longmire [2] at Los Alamos, and William 

Karzas and Richard Latter at RAND Corporation [3] developed a model for the EMP 

generated by a high-altitude nuclear explosion. The basic mechanism for this pulse 

generation is coherent radiation from the Compton electrons gyrating about the Earth's 

geomagnetic field. The pulse is produced in the gamma-ray absorption region of the 

atmosphere at an altitude of 20 to 40 km and radiates to large distances within line of 

sight of the gamma-ray source. In 1975 Sherman et al., Bell Laboratories, represented 

the radiating electric field as a double exponential pulse with a peak intensity of 50 

kV/m, a rise time near 10 ns, and a fall to one-half the peak value requiring over 100 ns. 

[4] We examine the forces acting on the Compton electrons and find that the peak field 

results in a significant retarding force. We inquire if this retarding force is a significant, 

neglected force that reduces expected peak field values because it is not obvious that 

this force is accounted for when current densities are modeled. Further motivation 

results because the relativistic form of the radiation reaction force is not readily 

calculable and because this reaction force has not been included in the models. A 

significant reduction in peak field strength below 50 kV/m would reduce the EMP 

threat and would save considerable taxpayer dollars spent hardening systems to the 

EMP environment. 
 

 

 

LARGE RETARDING FORCE RESULTING 
FROM MOMENTUM IN THE PROPAGATING WAVE 

Consider an EMP source region that is - 10 km in depth along a line of sight 

vertically downward at the equator. The coherent addition of radiation propagating 

downward along the line of sight results in energy and momentum being taken from 

the Compton electrons. A much weaker signal is radiated backward along the line of 

sight, and so a net force in the upward direction acts upon the ensemble of coherent 

electrons. The force is taken as the net time rate of change in the momentum carried by 

the radiation. 

 

Let the downward propagating wave have a peak electric field of 50 kV/m. The 
r 
H   = 6.6 x 106 W/m2. 

associated energy flux density is given by the Poynting vector 

r 
E x
  

At the peak energy flux density, the corresponding momentum flux density (in a 

plane-wave approximation) is given by (6.6 x 106 W/m2)/c = 2.2 x 10-2 N/m2, or 

approximately 3 x 10-6 psi exerted upon a perfectly absorbing screen. This momentum 

flux density is equal and opposite to the rate of change in momentum per unit area of 

the ensemble of electrons producing the radiation. Further division by c gives the 

momentum density at the peak of the radiating wave g = 7.3 x 10-11 Ns/m3. 
 

If there are nc coherent, radiating electrons per square meter within the source 

region, then the peak radiation-associated force on the average electron is 

 

 

  F rad = 2.2 x10−2 / n c N

. 

Longmire [5] has estimated that about 5 x 1018 Compton electrons contribute 

coherently, spread over an area A ~  π(400 m)2, giving a rough estimate of  

nc ~ 1013 e/m2.  This implies that the radiation--associated retarding force on the 

average electron is approximately equal to 2.2 x 10-15 N at the peak in the radiated 

power.  Because of the 1/r reduction in the radiated field, the force in the source region 

will be larger by a few tens of percent. This force will now be compared with the other 

forces on the Compton electrons to determine if it is negligible. 

 

Solving the Compton electron equations of motion is a critical step in 

determining the basic drivers for Maxwell's equations and is necessary for quantitative 

estimates of the radiating fields. Forces acting upon these Compton electrons appear in 

the equations of motion. The Lorentz force gives contributions associated with the E 

and B fields. With the air density represented by ρ, and the sea-level value by ρo, at cw 

frequency less than or equal to 100 MHz and at altitudes less than 60 km the electric 

fields are limited by air breakdown to values of E < 3 x 106 ρ/ρo V/m.  At an altitude of 

30 km, near the center of the source region for high-altitude EMP, this force is FE = eE < 

6.6 X 10-15 N.  The Earth's geomagnetic field is approximately equal- to 6 X 10-5 T, which 
implies that magnetic forces can reach F

r 
B ≤ 2.9 X 10 -15 N. With W 

   Bgeo = e r v x

representing the electron kinetic energy, the effective force produced by stoppingpower 

effects (at β=v/c=0.9) is represented as [6] Fstop = dW/dx=(2 MeV cm2/g)ρ  

< 5.4 x 10-16 N, where the 30-km air density is used for the estimate. The problem is 

time dependent. The initial electric field is zero, velocities are changing, and air 

densities vary. Hence, each of these forces should be considered in detail in the 

Compton electron equations of motion, The peak radiation-associated retarding force of 

approximately 2 x 10-15 N is significant; it must be taken into account when the electron 

equations of motion are solved. Rabinowitz has presented independent arguments that 

show that this retarding force is comparable to the geomagnetic force that produces the 

coherence and the radiation.[7] 

 

The momentum density imparted to the radiating electrons can be reduced 

somewhat by including the radiation that propagates upward. The downward-directed 

pulse has a width ∆td. The upward-directed pulse is spread over a much longer time, 

dependent upon a coherence length l. As a rough estimate, the width of the upward 

directed pulse is ∆tu = ∆td + 2l/c. Since ∆td << 2l/c, ∆tu/∆td ~2l/(c∆td). The net impulse 

is 

 

F d∆td − Fu ∆t u = Fd ∆t d 1 −
    

 
  
 

2lFu
c∆td Fd

 
  . 
 

This impulse is directed upward on the radiating electrons and furnishes the 

downward-directed momentum density in the propagating wave. So the effective 

retarding force is reduced by the factor within the brackets.  With a coherence length 

l ~104 m,  ∆td ~ 10-8 sec, and with an estimated Fu = 10-6 Fd corresponding to an upper 

bound on the upward propagating electric field approximately equal to 10-3 times the 

coherent downward signal, the momentum density given to the electrons is reduced by 

0.7%.  The angular distribution of radiation from an isolated 1-MeV electron in helical 

motion canalso be used to estimate the Fu /Fd ratio.  The ratio of the angular 

distributions of radiated power evaluated in the backward direction to that in the 

forward direction (relative to the velocity) is then approximately 10-5. Coherence effects 

acting constructively in the downward direction drastically lower this estimate. The net 

momentum transfer is large. The backward wave does not significantly reduce the 

estimate of the radiation-associated force. 

 

Consider properties of the force to see whether the force is already included, 

perhaps as part of the self-field effects. The reaction force is directed vertically upward 

and should be dependent upon the horizontal accelerations responsible for the coherent 

radiation (for our vertically downward line of sight). The self-fields include horizontal 

electric fields, but can result in a vertical force only through substitution of the 

associated accelerations into radiation reaction types of force where components appear 

antiparallel to the particle velocity. Since the electron velocity is nearly vertically 

downward the v x B (where B is the geomagnetic field or the self-generated magnetic 

field in the propagating wave) gives only a small vertical force, resulting from the 

horizontal component of v. In addition, the cross product does not change the particle 

energy, and so it cannot account for the energy carried away by the radiation. The Fstop 

is a statistical, incoherent effective force; the energy deposited forms ionization and 

excitation, not radiation. It is not obvious that Frad can be accounted for by self-field 

effects or by energy-loss effects already included within the equations of motion. Since 

radiation reaction forces on individual electrons are not included in the equations of 

motion, we next examine if this accounts for the large retarding force. 
 

RELATIVISTIC FORM AND NUMERICAL ESTIMATES 
FOR THE RADIATION REACTION FORCE 

 

The radiation reaction force has traditionally been neglected in EMP applications. 

This force results because the radiated wave carries energy, momentum, and angular 

momentum. The nonrelativistic form for the force is (in SI units where the subscript 
denotes radiation reaction)[8] F '  rr = e2 / 6πε oc3da / dt . Because the Compton electron 
speeds are ~0.9c, relativistic effects must be included. Here we examine several forms 

for the relativistic radiation reaction force. Some are judged nonphysical. We 

concentrate on two forms: the first is associated with the generation of electromagnetic 

µ ); the second is the Schott force on an individual radiating 
four-vector momentum (

The radiation reaction force has also been identified by saying that this force is

where P is the Lorentz invariant energy radiation rate as defined by Eq. (3). This gives

Equation (3) is used to estimate P for an individual radiating electron. Let the 

Lorentz factor of special relativity, γ = 3  (kinetic energy=l MeV, β =0.94) for a Compton 

electron in instantaneous circular motion in a magnetic field B = 60 µT. Then v-a = 0,  
  a = eBv / γm = 9.92 x 1014 m / s2
  P = e2γ 4a 2 / 6πεoc3 = 4. 5 x 10−22 W . Equation (4) shows that the spatial portion of F
µ
  rr
associated with this P is much less than the FE, FBgeo, and FStop estimated earlier and is 

 , and the instantaneous power radiated is 

 

negligible in the electron equations of motion. If this power were radiated incoherently 

by nc = 1013 e/m2, the total power per unit area would be ncP =4.5 x 10-9 W/m2, much 

less than the 6.6 x 106 W/m2 in the EMP peak. If this power were radiated coherently by 

each of (the earlier noted) approximately 5 X 1018 contributing electrons, the power 

becomes much greater than that in the EMP peak. However the contributing electrons 

are only partially in phase. The coherent addition that gives 6.6 x 106 W/m2 at the EMP 

peak led us to the 2.2 X 10-15 N force on the average electron that we found earlier. 

The estimate from Eq. (4) showed that the individual Compton electrons 

generate a negligible

 . We now review some coherence effects to investigate their 

consequences on these forces. The electric field generated by one electron is given by

distance from the gamma-ray absorption region to the earth directly under our burst). 

Our sample electron generates a peak electric field radiated in the forward direction, 

E=1.3 x 10-13 V/m. If a group of electrons is radiating coherently in this forward 

direction, then Nc=4 x 1017 electrons give E = 5 x 104 V/m, the peak EMP. At a lower 

average electron energy, because of the smaller β more electrons would be required to 

furnish the same field. A lower estimate for Nc can be obtained by reducing R to 

perhaps 30 km. The power and the electric field radiated by the ensemble is increased 

by the coherence. The associated radiation forces must also increase. 

We broaden our search for the large radiation reaction force by following 

Rohrlich [9] and introducing the Schott force. Rohrlich defines a force four-vector as

are the following: the force resulting from incident radiation, the external forces, and the 

radiation reaction force previously encountered in Eq. (4) (which is the negative of the 

rate at which electromagnetic four-momentum is emitted). The Lorentz-Dirac equation

We can now estimate the Schott force associated with several characteristics of the

Compton electron motion. One of the large accelerations that might be experienced is

transverse, the acceleration would be F  E / (γm ) = a1 / γ . With this latter acceleration we 

examine upper limits for the three terms in the Schott force. 

For the transverse acceleration with γ = 3, ∆t = 10-8 s, and with the inconsistent 

but bounding assumption that v is antiparallel to a, the terms are bounded by

These contributions to the Schott force are several orders of magnitude below the FE, 

FBgeo, and FStop estimated earlier, and are negligible. For GeV rather than MeV electron 

energies, the Schott force becomes comparable to the other forces even for just the 

contributions examined above. At larger energies the Schott force and the Frr will be the 

dominant forces. 

 

The geomagnetic force results in an acceleration that contributes to the radiation 

reaction force. In this case   

β ⋅ a

 = 0, reducing the upper bounds found earlier. The re-

sulting acceleration is smaller than the earlier estimate of radial acceleration; hence this 

contribution to the Schott force is also negligible. For particle motion in a circular orbit, 

we later find that a   is zero, so the timelike component of S
 

 is zero. For this orbit the

 is also larger than the spacelike component of   Sµ

.  The ratio 

spacelike component of   
is   F rr / S = γ 2 − 1. 
 

The arguments here have shown that the examined contributions to the Schott 

force (that result from the Compton electron motion in breakdown electric fields and in 

the geomagnetic field) are negligible. When a significant radiation (associated with 

other accelerations) must be accounted for as in the EMP case, then the associated 

Schott terms might be large, and the resulting force could then dominate [7] the terms 

contributing to the Schott force and be comparable to the FE, FBgeo, and FStop. 

 

Let us consider ways in which coherence effects might increase the Schott force. 

When applied to a single electron traveling in a path like that experienced in the EMP 

case, the Schott force on an individual electron is expected to be approximately the 

same in magnitude as the tangential force necessary to keep a radiating particle 

traveling in a circle of radius r and radiating independently of other electrons.

and is the negative of the required tangential force. In terms of proper time τ (where 

  d / dτ = γd / dt , γS(t) = S(τ), the Schott force is in agreement with Rohrlich, [9] who has 

solved this problem with a different approach. Without the tangential force, the 

radiation rate is initially the same as for the actual orbit. The radiation loss then results 

in a reduction in v (and a reduction in r if the circular motion is provided by an 

imposed uniform magnetic field). Coherence effects can increase this force. If there is an 

ensemble of Nc electrons radiating coherently as one body, then the total force on the 

ensemble will scale as the square of the charge, (Nce)2 , and the force on the average 

electron is

(18) 

For a typical high-altitude EMP with v = 0.9c, γ = 3, r=80 m, and Nc > 1015 electrons,  

Frad > 10-15N. This is comparable to the geomagnetic force on each electron radiating to 

produce the EMP. Such a force cannot be neglected. However, Eq. (18) can only be 

applied approximately in the equations of motion. The Compton electrons are 

generated over a large region of space and only a subset within a quarter wavelength 

can radiate coherently as a single body. At f > 1 MHz, for example, λ/4 < 75 m; this is a 

small portion of the source region generating the high-altitude EMP. Even if the 

equation were valid for high-altitude EMP, a prescription would be needed to 

determine the Nc appropriate for electrons at different positions in the gamma-ray 

absorption region as a function of time.  

 

 

 

As an alternate view of the effects of coherence, consider Rohrlich's treatment [9] 

of a closed system of N charged particles. There, the Lorentz invariant form of the equa-

tion of motion for the kth particle is given by the Lorentz-Dirac equations for each of the 

particles (with proper asymptotic conditions as discussed by Rohrlich): 

µ
µ = Fk,in

(19) 

The acceleration of the kth particle is caused by three forces: Fk,in produced by the 
electromagnetic fields incident upon the ensemble, the "radiation reaction" force Γµ
and the force produced by all the other particles F

, The subscript ret indicates that 

, 

µ
  k,ret

the force from other particles must be evaluated in retarded time. 

The 

µ

   kF ,ret

 results from a sum over all the other particles, with the retarded time 

varying with each particle in the sum. As Rohrlich states, this term represents the only 

mutual interaction between the charged particles. The transverse electric field effects are 

built into this term, including whatever coherence is present in the local field. So a 

factor proportional to N does occur in the self-field term (with a constraint imposed by 

air breakdown). In this approach the radiation reaction force is not directly enhanced by 
µ
a coherence effect. No multiplicative factor N appears in any part of the   Γk

 term in  

Eq. (19). Physically, the radiation reaction force on one electron cannot depend upon 

coherent addition of radiation if the addition occurs at a later time and at a location 

deeper in the atmosphere. When each electron radiates, it experiences a local 

electromagnetic field that is enhanced by coherence effects. This gives a correspond-

ingly larger radiation reaction force. 

In this section we have identified the radiation reaction forces

geomagnetic fields indicated a negligible S

examined ways coherence effects enhance the radiation reaction forces. Earlier we 

showed that the high-altitude EMP peak amplitude implies a large radiation reaction. 

The following section shows that the large reaction is accounted for by a self-field effect. 
 

SELF-FIELD EFFECT 

 

To account for the momentum in the propagating wave, we first review how the 

energy is generated by the transverse component of the current density. The argument 

is then extended to account for the momentum. The rate at which work is done per unit 

volume is given by

In 1974, Longmire showed (and later published in Ref. 11) that when the outgoing wave 

equation for the radiating field is solved self-consistently, the equation can lead to 

energy conservation. The energy thus given to the electromagnetic fields by the 

Compton electrons is shared by Joule heating in the conduction current and by the 

energy stored within the electromagnetic fields. 

 

 

To illustrate explicitly the energy conservation, we consider a one-dimensional 

example that has some features similar to generation of high-altitude EMP. In 

 ˆ 
Appendix A we derive the equation for the outgoing wave traveling in the direction + x  

(the circumflex indicates a unit vector in the associated direction). There we find

identical. The difference between cells n - 1 and n is that the field from the n - 1 cell is

This is exactly equal to the contribution of the nth cell to the energy flux density, as

Because the contribution of the nth cell has a multiplicative factor 2n - 1, a large n 

in our example might make the electric field large enough to result in a significant 

Schott force in the microscopic equations of motion. However, air breakdown limits E in 

the actual case. The analysis has shown that the factor 2n - 1 results from a self-field 

effect, where the cells respond to the fields created by other cells. The energy flux 

density contributed by each cell is accounted for by the

Thus at large n the energy flux density becomes dominated by the distant upstream 

generators rather than by the locally generated fields. The locally generated transverse 

fields never dominate the electric fields at the exit of our one-dimensional example. If 

the current density were specified in terms of a distribution of electrons launched into a 

vacuum at τ =0 with a specific vt, then at later τ and for sufficiently large n > ns , the 

fields will be high enough that self-field effects reduce Jt for cells with n > ns , The 

example illustrates that the 6.6 X 106 W/m2 energy flux density generated by 

high-altitude EMP is a self-field effect. The energy is balanced by a corresponding loss 

in Compton electron kinetic energy. 

 

Thus far our simple example has concentrated upon energy considerations. Note 

that the electric field is a transverse field and cannot correspond to a force along the 

propagation direction x. The momentum density carried by the wave must also be 

balanced by a reaction in our basic source that keeps the current density in the given 

 

form. The momentum density carried by the wave is

At a given τ, the rate of gain in momentum density in the propagating wave produced 

by an element   

∆x

 is equal and opposite to the JXB force density acting on the current 

density within the element

Frad is based upon the approximately 3-µpsi peak momentum flux density being 

radiated. This momentum is furnished by the 

r 
B  force, and ultimately by a loss in 

r 
J x
  

electron momentum.  Interaction with the self-generated magnetic field accounts for the 

momentum density in the propagating wave; interaction with the self-generated electric 

field accounts for the energy in the propagating wave.

The peak propagating B is about 2.8 Bgeo. The Compton electron velocity is mainly 

radial rather than transverse. (In the 10-ns rise time of the Bell Laboratories waveform, a

ment of the ratio of the contribution by the nth cell to the contribution of all the cells 

from 1 to n - 1 is a little more tedious than for the Cartesian case. At large n, again the 

ratio scales as 1/n. The local transverse fields never dominate the electric fields at 

the exit. 

Rather than using the explicit division into cells to illustrate energy and 

momentum conservation, we can derive these constraints from Eq. (A10).  At given τ in 

a material of impedance Z0, multiplication by the component Et parallel to J, gives

That is, the energy flux carried by the plane wave (E  t

the net rate at which work is done (per unit area) by the upstream transverse current 

density in creating the transverse electric field intensity.

The rate at which the transverse convention-current density has done work on the

Substitution for the spatial gradient term from Eq. (38) gives   ∂g / ∂t = −Jt Et / c . The 
transverse plane wave has E,=cBt, so   ∂g / ∂t = −JtBt , consistent with Eq. (30). The rate of 
gain in momentum density carried by the propagating wave is equal to the Jt x Bt force 

density acting upon the current density. Separation into convection and conduction 

terms gives 

∂g

(42) 

Analogous to the energy flux calculation, a loss in the transverse convection-current- 

density term adds momentum to the propagating wave; the transverse conduction-

current-density term absorbs momentum from the propagating wave. 

CONCLUSIONS 

  

We have identified the mechanism that generates the large retarding radiation- 

associated force acting on the Compton electrons that produce the high-altitude EMP. 

The force is significant and is implicit in EMP calculations for MeV energies when 

current densities are modeled in a self-consistent manner.  The momentum flux density 

in the propagating EMP results from the force due to the interaction between the 

self-generated magnetic field and the transverse component of current density in the 

gamma-absorption region of the atmosphere. As long as the transverse current density 

is obtained in a self-consistent manner, then the energy and momentum in the 
r 
J t ⋅
  

r 
E t  terms that drain energy and transverse 

propagating wave result directly from 

momentum from the current density and from 

r 
J t x
  

r 
B t  terms that drain longitudinal 

momentum from the current density.  When convection-electron equations of motion 

r v x
are solved self-consistently, the e
  

r 
B and the e  

r 
E  forces include the reaction forces 

acting on the transverse current density.  

 

 

 

The relativistic form of the classical radiation reaction forces on a single particle 

have been examined. These are the additional forces introduced into the equations of 

motion just because the charged particle is radiating energy and momentum. Present 

high-altitude EMP codes neglect these reaction forces; hence, rigorous energy and 

momentum conservation are not inherent within the codes. However, radiation reaction 

forces as calculated for an isolated electron are negligible compared to other forces on 

the MeV Compton electrons. These reaction forces F

 are a type of self-field

effect where the electron reacts to its own radiation. Neglect of these forces does not 

lead to overestimates of the high-altitude EMP peak. As described in the previous 

paragraph, the primary self-field effect is the electron reacting to the coherent fields 

created by the other charged particles to provide the

APPENDIX: TRANSVERSE ELECTRIC FIELD  
FOR A ONE-DIMENSIONAL OUTGOING WAVE 

In Sl units, the differential forms for Maxwell's curl equations are Ampere's law, 

  ∇ x H = Jc + σE + ∂D / ∂t , 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(A1) 

and Faraday's law of induction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  ∇ x E = −∂B/ ∂t  

 

 

The current density is divided into the convection current Jc, the conduction current σE, 

and the displacement current   ∂D / ∂t .  The divergence of Faraday's law gives 

  ∂(∇ ⋅B)/ ∂t = 0, and so in the initial absence of magnetic monopoles,   

∇ ⋅ B

 remains zero. 

 

 

 

 

The equation of continuity 

  ∇ ⋅ (Jc + σE) + ∂ρ / ∂t = 0  

 

coupled with the divergence of Ampere's law (A1), gives  ∂(∇ ⋅D − ρ) / ∂t = 0 . The initial 

condition   

∇ ⋅ D = ρ

 remains true at later times. 

The equations are sometimes more convenient to solve after a transformation of 

variables. When the EMP is produced by a propagating pulse of photons, spatial  

variables have steep gradients at the position of the pulse. At a given position, as the 

pulse passes, the fields change rapidly with both space and time. At a given retarded 

time the spatial variation is much less severe. This allows larger spatial steps in 

numerical simulations of the phenomena. In terms of retarded time   

τ = t − (µε)1/ 2r

 in a 

spherical coordinate system (  r ,θ, φ), the various operators transform as

Abstract: This paper reports the effort of deducing the initial strategy distributions of agents in mix-game model 

which is used to predict a real financial time series generated from a target financial market. Using mix-game to 

predict  Shanghai  Index,  we  find  the  time  series  of  prediction  accurate  rates  is  sensitive  to  the  initial  strategy 

distributions of agents in group 2 who play minority game, but less sensitive to the initial strategy distributions 

of agents in group 1 who play majority game. And agents in group 2 tend to cluster in full strategy space (FSS) if 

the real financial time series has obvious tendency (upward or downward), otherwise they tend to scatter in FSS. 

We  also  find  that  the  initial  strategy  distributions  and  the  number  of  agents  in  group  1  influence  the  level  of 

prediction accurate rates. Finally, this paper gives suggestion about further research.

1.  Introduction 

Forecasting financial markets is a continuous effort of researchers, and attracts great attention of practitioners. 

The use of agent-based models to forecast financial markets is a new attempt in this area. Neil F. Johnson etc. 

reported on a technique based on multi-agent games which has potential use in predicting future movements of 

financial time-series. In their articles, minority game (MG) [1] is trained on a real financial time series, and then 

run into the future to extract next step and multi-step predictions [2, 3, 4]. In order to improve the forecasting 

accurate  rate,  C.  Gou  used  mix-game  [5,  6]  to  predict  Shanghai  Index.  She  found  that  using  mix-game  can 

improve forecasting accurate rate at least 3% more than using minority game and the forecasting accurate rate is 

sensitive  to  the  initial  strategy  distributions  of  agents  [7].  The  initial  strategy  distribution  (ISD)  is  distributed 

randomly  in  full  strategy  space  and  kept  unchangeable  during  the  game.  Since  the  environment  of  a  financial 

market  is  changeable,  agents  in  the  market  need  to  adjust  their  strategies  to  survive  in  the  market.  For  the 

purpose  of  prediction,  we  also  need  to  tune  the  ISD  of  mix-game  model  so  as  to  get  a  good  accurate  rate  of 

prediction, i.e. agents in mix-game model need to change their strategies. Therefore, understanding what factors 

influence the accurate rates of prediction and how agents in mix-game move in their strategy spaces is important 

for predicting a financial time series. In order to do so, this paper looks at the backward question that we try to 

deduce the strategy distributions of agents in their strategy spaces in mix-game according to a real financial time 

series. 

This paper is organized as following. Section 2 introduces the model and the methodology of deducing the 

strategy distributions of agents. Section 3 reports the results and discussion. Section 4 gives the conclusion. 

2.  The model and the methodology   

2.1 Mix-game model 

Since  mix-game  model  is  an  extension  of  minority  game  [1],  its  structure  is  similar  to  MG.  In  mix-game, 

there are two groups of agents; group 1 plays the majority game, and group 2 plays the minority game. N (odd 

number)  is  the  total  number  of  the  agents,  and  N1  is  number  of  agents  in  group  1.  The  system  resource  is 

R=0.5*N. All agents compete in the system for the limited resource R. T1 and T2 are the time horizon lengths of 

the two groups, and m1 and m2 denote the history memories of the two groups, respectively.     

The  global  information  only  available  to  agents  is  a  common  bit-string  “memory”  of  the  m1  or  m2  most 

recent competition outcomes (1 or 0). A strategy consists of a response, i.e., 0 (sell) or 1 (buy), to each possible 

history bit string; hence there are 

possible strategies for group 1 or group 2, respectively, which 

m

122

or 

m

222

form full strategy spaces (FSS). At the beginning of the game, each agent is assigned s strategies and keeps them 

unchangeable during the game. After each turn, agents assign one virtual point to a strategy which would have 

predicted  the  correct  outcome.  For  agents  in  group  1,  they  reward  their  strategies  one  point  if  they  are  in  the 

majority side. In contrast, for agents in group 2, they reward their strategies one point if they are in the minority 

side.  Agents  collect  the  virtual  points  for  their  strategies  over  the  time  horizon  T1  or  T2,  and  they  use  their 

strategies  which  have  the  highest  virtual  point  in  each turn.  If  there  are  two  strategies  which  have  the  highest 

virtual point, agents use coin toss to decide which strategy to be used. Excess demand is equal to the number of 

ones (buy) which agents choose minus the number of zeros (sell) which agents choose. According to a widely 

accepted  assumption  that  excess  demand  exerts  a  force  on  the  price  of  the  asset  and  the  change  of  price  is 

proportion to the excess demand in a financial market, the time series of the price can be calculated based on the 

time series of the excess demand [8, 9]. 

2.2  Prediction method 

We use mix-game model to do one-step direction prediction about a real financial time series generated by a 

target  financial  market,  whose  dynamics  are  well-described  by  a  mix-game  model  for  a  unknown  parameter 

configuration of T1, T2, m1, m2, N, N1 and an unknown specific realization of initial strategy choices (ISD). After 

we select the parameter configuration for mix-game model, we use it to predict the time series generated by the 

target financial market. Fig.1 shows the work chart for prediction.

Fig.1 work chart for prediction 

In the mix-game model, agents receive the global information which is strings of 1's and 0's (Wex) digitized 

from the real financial time series produced by the target financial market other than that (Win) generated by the 

mix-game model itself, and agents also reward their strategies according to the real financial time series (Wex). 

In order  to  see  the  performances  of  the  mix-game  model, we  compare  the  time  series  generated  by  mix-game 

with the real financial time series produced by the target financial market, i.e. we compare Win with Wex since 

we just predict the directions. If they match, the mix-game model gets one point; if not, it gets zero. This point is 

referred to as accurate scores. Before prediction, we use real market data of time-step T3 to train the mix-game 

model. We calculate the accurate rate at every time-step according to the following formula: 

Accurate rate (current time) = accurate scores (current time, counted within T4)/ T4        (1), 

where T4 is a time window within which we count the accurate scores and this time window moves along the real 

financial  time  series  so  that  we  can  get  a  time  series  of  prediction  accurate  rates.  After  finishing  the  total 

predicting turns, we calculate the accumulated accurate rate which is equal to total accurate scores divided by 

total predicting turns, i.e.   

Accumulated accurate rate = total accurate scores/ total prediction turns     

 

  (2). 

2.3  Method for deduction of strategy distributions of agents 

First we need to select a proper parameter configuration for modeling the target financial market. According 

to  reference  [5],  the  mix-game  model  with  some  parameter  configurations  reproduces  the  stylized  features  of 

financial time series. Therefore, we need to choose parameters of m1, m2, T1, T2, N and N1 when using mix-game 

to model financial markets. To do so, the following aspects need to be considered. 

(cid:122)  First  make  sure  the  time  series  of  mix-game  can  reproduce  the  stylized  facts  of  price  time  series  of 

financial markets by choosing proper parameters: m1<m2=6, T1<T2 , N1/N<0.5; 

(cid:122)  Second  pay  attention  to  the  fluctuation  of  local  volatilities,  and  ensure  that  the  median  of  local 

volatilities of mix-game is similar to that of the target time series; 

(cid:122)  Third make sure the log-log plot of absolute returns look similar. 

Second, we divide the time series of the real financial time series into several pieces. For each piece of time 

series, we use simple generic algorithm to search for the best ISD of agents by which the model can give the best 

prediction for this piece of real financial time series [7]. Therefore, we can see how the strategy distributions of 

agents change along the real financial time series. Usually we need to adjust T1, T2 and N1 in order to get high 

prediction accurate rate during this process. 

3.  Results and discussions 

As an example, we use the above methodology to deduce the strategy distributions of agents in mix-game 

which is used to game to predict Shanghai Index dating from 02-07-2002 to 19-03-2004, as shown in Fig.2. We 

can see that there are downward tendency, upward tendency and balance states in the time series shown in Fig.2. 

So  this  period  of  Shanghai  Index  is  a  typical  example  for  study.  According  to  reference  [5],  we  get  one 

configuration of parameters of mix-game for simulation of Shanghai Index which is m1=3, m2=6, T1=12, T2=60, 

N=201, N1=40, s=2.

A strategy is a response, i.e., 0 (sell) or 1 (buy), to each possible history bit string. Hence, we can turn the 

strategy into an integer value and plot it, and the integer value goes from zero to (

m

12 −

2

1

) or (

m

22 −

2

1

) for 

group 1 or group 2, respectively. Since each agent has 2 strategies, it is possible to illustrate ISD in a 2D-figure, 

as shown in Fig.3a where x-axis represents ‘strategy R’ and y-axis represents ‘strategy R`’ so that any point in 

this  figure  represents  2  strategies  which  one  agent  holds  and  all  points  in  this  figure  form  the  initial  strategy 

distribution（ISD）. Following the method as mentioned in section 2, we deduce the ISDs of the mix-game model 

according to the real financial time series shown in Fig.2. By analyzing these ISDs, we can get to know what 

factors influence the accurate rates of prediction and how agents move in their strategy spaces. 

3.1 What factors influence the accurate rates of prediction? 

In  reference  [7],  C.  Gou  found  that  prediction  accurate  rates  are  sensitive  to  ISD.  However,  there  are  two 

ISDs in mix-game: ISD1 is the strategy distribution of group 1; ISD2 is the strategy distribution of group 2. So 

the question is the prediction accurate rate is sensitive to both ISD1 and ISD2 or just any of them. To look at this 

issue,  we  did  simulations  with  three  different  ISD1  but  the  same  ISD2_a  in  which  all  agents  have  the  same 

strategies.    Fig.3a, Fig.4a and Fig.5a show the three different ISD1 with N1=90, m 1=3: all agents in group 1 have 

different strategies in ISD1_a_1 (Fig.3a); all agents in group 1 have the same strategies in ISD1_a_2 (Fig.4a); at 

least two agents in group 1 have the same strategies in ISD1_a_3 (Fig.5a).     

    The  time  series  of  prediction  accurate  rates  of  mix-game  are  shown  in  Fig.3b  for  initial  strategy 

distributions  of  ISD1_a_1  and  ISD2_a,  Fig.4b  for  initial  strategy  distributions  of  ISD1_a_2  and  ISD2_a  and 

Fig.5b for initial strategy distributions of ISD1_a_3 and ISD2_a, respectively. Comparing these three figures, we 

can  find  these  three  time  series  of  the  prediction  accurate  rates  of  mix-game  for  Shanghai  Index  dating  from 

02-07-2002 to 19-03-2004 look similar despite of the obvious difference of their ISD1. This implies that the time 

series  of  prediction  accurate  rates  is  mainly  influenced  by  ISD2.  That  is  to  say,  the  time  series  of  prediction 

accurate rates are more sensitive to ISD2, but less sensitive to ISD1. A possible explanation for this observation is 

that  the  characteristics  of  minority  game  dominants  in  mix-game  if  N1/N<0.5  and  agents  in  group  1  are  just 

“trend followers” [6].

However, we also find that ISD1 have influence on the accurate rate level, as shown in table 1 which shows 

the  accumulated  accurate  rates  of  mix-game  at  390  predicting  turns  with  ISD2_a  and  three  different  ISD1 

(ISD1_a_1, ISD1_a_2 and ISD1_a_3). From table 1, we notice that the accumulated accurate rates are different 

with different ISD1. This implies that ISD1 can influence the level of the accumulated accurate rates.

s=2, ISD1 similar to ISD1_a_1 and ISD2 similar to ISD2_a at 390 predicting turns. From table 2, we can see that 

the number of agents in group 1 greatly influences the accumulated accurate rates and the accumulated accurate 

rates increase with the increase of the number of agents in group 1. A possible explanation for this finding is that 

mix-game can simulate Shanghai Index better than MG [5].

3.2 Agents move in their strategy spaces 

Now we look at how agents in mix-game move in their strategy spaces while we use the mix-game to predict 

Shanghai Index as shown in Fig.2. First we divide this time series into four pieces: the first piece from 0 to 126th 

time-step  which  has  the  downward  tendency;  the  second  piece  from  127th  to  230th  time-step  which  is 

characteristic  of  two  balance  states;  the  third  piece  from  231st  to  341st  time-step  which  has  the  downward 

tendency; the 4th piece from 342nd to 415th time-steps which has the upward tendency. Then we use the method 

mentioned in section 2 to get the best ISDs for the above pieces of Shanghai Index so that we can see how agents 

move  in  their  strategy  spaces.  Since  the  time  series  of  prediction  accurate  rates  is  only  sensitive  to  ISD2,  we 

focus on agents in group 2 in the following discussion. 

From  Fig.3b,  we  can  see  that  ISD2_a  has  high  prediction  accurate  rates  from  60th  time-step  to  150th 

time-step. From Fig.6b, we observe that ISD2_b has high prediction accurate rates from 150th time-step to 200th 

time-step, and from 250th time-step to 300th time-step. Fig.7b shows that ISD2_c has high prediction accurate 

rates from 200th time-step to 250th time-step. Fig.8b shows that ISD2_d has high prediction accurate rates from 

300th time-step to 350th time-step. Therefore, we find that ISD2 changes from ISD2_a to ISD2_b, to ISD2_c, to 

ISD2_b, to ISD2_d along the time series shown in Fig.2. By analyzing ISD2_a, ISD2_b, ISD2_c and ISD2_d, we can 

notice that the distribution of agents in ISD2 changes from one point to half FSS and scatters further to whole 

FSS,  then  shrinks  to half  FSS  and  shrinks further. Associating  the  change  of ISD2  with  the  time  series  shown 

Fig.2,  we  can  find  that  agents  tend  to  cluster  in  FSS  if  the  real  financial  time  series  has  obvious  tendency 

(upward or downward), otherwise they tend to scatter in FSS and the strategies of agents are more diversified in 

balance states. This is accordance with the common knowledge about financial markets.

4.  Conclusion 

We  successfully  introduce  a  method  to  deduce  the  initial  strategy  distributions  (ISD)  of  multi-agent-based 

mix-game model to predict a real financial time series, and can understand what factors influence the accurate 

rates of prediction and how agents in mix-game model move in their strategy spaces by analyzing the ISDs.   

Using mix-game to predict Shanghai Index dating from 02-07-2002 to 30-12-2003, we find the time series of 

prediction accurate rates is more sensitive to ISD2 of group 2 than ISD1 of group 1, and agents in group 2 tend to 

cluster in FSS if the real financial time series has obvious tendency, otherwise they tend to scatter in FSS. We 

also find that ISD1 and the number of agents in group 1 influence the level of prediction accurate rates.   

The above results shed light on further research of agent-based prediction. We may let agents change their 

strategies during the process of prediction in order to get better prediction accurate rates by introducing generic 

algorithm  into  mix-game  model.  We  may  only  let  agents  in  group  2  to  change  their  strategies  because  the 

prediction accurate rates are more sensitive to ISD2 of group 2 than ISD1 of group 1.

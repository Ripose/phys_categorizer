Abstract

A general formulation of noncommutative or quantum derivatives for oper-

ators in a Banach space is given on the basis of the Leibniz rule, irrespective

of their explicit representations such as the Gˆateaux derivative or commutators.

This yields a uniﬁed formulation of quantum analysis, namely the invariance of

quantum derivatives, which are expressed by multiple integrals of ordinary higher

derivatives with hyperoperator variables. Multivariate quantum analysis is also

formulated in the present uniﬁed scheme by introducing a partial inner derivation

and a rearrangement formula. Operator Taylor expansion formulas are also given
by introducing the two hyperoperators δA→B ≡ −δ−1

A B);A
with the inner derivation δA : Q 7→ [A, Q] ≡ AQ − QA. Physically the present

A δB and dA→B ≡ δ(−δ−1

noncommutative derivatives express quantum ﬂuctuations and responses.

I. Introduction

Recently noncommutative calculus has attracted the interest of many mathe-

matians and physicists1−15. The present author10−15 has introduced the quantum

derivative df (A)/dA of the operator function f (A) in the Gˆateaux diﬀerential1−3

df (A) = lim

(1.1)

Here the quantum derivative df (A)/dA is a hyperoperator10−15, which maps an

arbitrary operator dA to the diﬀerential df (A) in a Banach space. There is also

an algebraic deﬁnition8,9,12,13 of the diﬀerential df (A) as

for an auxiliary operator H in a Banach space. This diﬀerential depends on H.

In particular, we have

df (A) = [H, f (A)]

dA = [H, A].

The property that d2A = 0 requires the following condition

[H, [H, A]] = [H, dA] = 0.

In the previous papers10−13, we have shown that the diﬀerential df (A)/dA

deﬁned in (1.1) is expressed by

df (A)
dA

=

δf (A)
δA

where δA denotes an inner derivation deﬁned by

δAQ = [A, Q] = AQ − QA

(1.5)

(1.6)

for an arbitrary operator Q in a Banach space. The ratio of the two hyperoperators

in (1.5) is well deﬁned10−13 when f (A) is a convergent operator power series.

On the other hand, the derivative df (A)/dA deﬁned through the commutator

(1.2) is also expressed9,12,13,16 by Eq.(1.5). This is easily derived as follows. From

Eq.(1.2), we have

df (A) = δHf (A) = −δf (A)H = −δ−1

using the commutativity of δA and δf (A). The meaning of the formal inverse δ−1

in Eq.(1.7) will be discussed in the succeeding section. The above results suggest

2

that the quantum derivative df (A)/dA deﬁned in Eq.(1.8) is invariant for any

choice of deﬁnitions of the diﬀerential df (A). One of the main purposes of the

present paper is to make a uniﬁed formulation of quantum analysis and to prove

the invariance of the quantum derivative df (A)/dA deﬁned in

for any diﬀerential df (A) satisfying the Leibniz rule

In Sec.III we present a general formulation of

df (A). Theorem II gives the invariance of the derivative, df (A)/dA. Theorem III

presents algebraic expressions of higher diﬀerentials {dnf (A)}. Theorem IV gives
multiple integral representations of higher derivatives {dnf (A)/dAn}. Theorem

V presents a general Taylor expansion formula of f (A + xB) in terms of higher

derivatives {dnf (A)/dAn} for the noncommutative operators A and B. A shift-

hyperoperator SA(B) : f (A) 7→ f (A+B) is also formulated. A general formulation

of multivariate quantum analysis is given in Sec.IV, by introducing a partial inner

derivation and a rearrangement formula. In Sec.V, an auxiliary operator method

is brieﬂy discussed, and it is extended to multivariate operator functions.

In

Sec.VI, some general remarks and applications to exponential product formulas

are brieﬂy mentioned. Summary and discussion are given in Sec.VII.

II. Inner Derivation, its Formal Inverse and Uniqueness

In the present section, we introduce the two hyperoperators (−δ−1

A δB) and
A B), and discuss the existence and uniqueness of these hyperoperators in the

δ(−δ−1

3

domain DA, which is deﬁned by the set of convergent power series of the operator

A in a Banach space. In general, it seems to be meaningless to use the symbol
δ−1
A , because the inverse of the inner derivation δA does not necessarily exist and

furthermore is not unique even if it exists. Fortunately in our problem, only the
combinations (−δ−1

A B) appear in our quantum analysis of single-

A δB) and δ(−δ−1

variable functions. Thus there is a possibility to deﬁne them uniquely.

(i) Hyperoperator δA→B ≡ −δ−1

A δB

First we show that the hyperoperator (−δ−1

A δB) is well deﬁned when it operates

on a function f (A) in the domain DA. For this purpose, we conﬁrm that

δA→BA ≡ (−δ−1

A δB)A = δ−1

A (−δBA) = δ−1

A δAB = B,

(2.1)

namely δA→B : A 7→ B. More generally, we have

δA→BAn =

Ak(δA→BA)An−k−1 =

AkBAn−k−1

(2.2)

n−1

Xk=0

n−1

Xk=0

for any positive integer n. Thus, the hyperoperator δA→B ≡ −δ−1

A δB is well

deﬁned, at least, in the domain DA. Thus, the existence of δA→B has been shown,

but it is not unique. In fact, we put

δA→Bf (A) = F (A, B)

(2.3)

which is constructed by the above procedure. Then, F (A, B) + G(A) may be also
a solution of (−δ−1

A δB)f (A), because

− δBf (A) = δAF (A, B) + δAG(A)

(2.4)

for any operator G(A) in a Banach space. If we impose, besides the Leibniz rule,

the linearity of the hyperoperator δA→B, namely

δA→B(f (A) + g(A)) = δA→Bf (A) + δA→Bg(A),

(2.5)

4

and

δA→B(af (A)) = aδA→Bf (A)

(2.6)

for a complex number a, then the uniqueness of δA→B is assured.

In fact, the

expression F (A, B) in (2.3) is obtained explicitly by using this linearity of the

hyperoperator δA→B.

In order to study the role of the hyperoperator δA→B more explicitly, we intro-

duce the symmetrized product {AmBn}sym(A,B) by

{AmBn}sym(A,B) ≡

Ak1BAk2 · · · AknBAkn+1,

(2.7)

k1+···+kn+1=m,kj≥0
X

where m, n, {kj} denote non-negative integers. This symmetrized product is also

written as

{AmBn}sym(A,B) =

#x=0

Then, Eq.(2.2) is expressed by

δA→BAm = {Am−1B}sym(A,B).

(2.8)

(2.9)

Hereafter, we write {· · ·}sym(A,B) simply as {· · ·}sym, when no confusion arises.

δA→B{AmB}sym = {Am−1B2}sym,

(2.10)

Similarly we obtain

because

namely

Consequently, the domain of the hyperoperator δA→B is extended to the region

Dsym(A,B) which is a set of convergent noncommuting symmetrized power series of

The proof of this formula is given as follows. First note that

δA+xB(A + xB)m+n = 0,

− xδB(A + xB)m+n = δA(A + xB)m+n.

By comparing the (n + 1)-th terms of the both sides of (2.16) in x and using

the relation (2.8), we obtain Eq.(2.13) and consequently Eq.(2.14). An alterna-

tive derivation of Eq.(2.13) will be given by extending the procedure shown in

Next we study the property of the power hyperoperators {δk

An operator H deﬁned by

(2.19)

does not necessarily exist, as is well known. However, the hyperoperator δ(−δ−1
A B) is
well deﬁned, at least, when it operates on f (A) in the domain DA for an operator

A in a Banach space. In fact, we can interpret it as

as a hyperoperator operating on the left-hand-side hyperoperator δA (not on the

right-hand-side operator B). In this interpretation, the hyperoperator δ(−δ−1

(2.23)

This new hyperoperator dA→B is deﬁned in the domain DA,B which is a set of

convergent noncommuting power series of the operators A and B. Clearly, dA→B

is a kind of diﬀerential satisfying the Leibniz rule for B = dA.

Next we study the power hyperoperators {dn

A→B}. Clearly they are also dif-
ferentials deﬁned in the domain DA,B. It will be interesting to ﬁnd the relation
between dn

The proof of Formula 5 is given by mathematical induction using the following

B in a Banach space, we have

dA→B{AmBn}sym = (n + 1){Am−1Bn+1}sym.

(2.27)

This is easily proved by using the deﬁnition (2.7) of {AmBn}sym as in Eq.(2.24).

Formula 5 can be also conﬁrmed directly from the consideration on the num-
ber of permutations of Bn. More intuitively, δn

With these preparations, we discuss a general theory of derivatives of f (A)

with respect to the operator A itself in the succeeding section.

III. Quantum Derivative, its Invariance and Operator Taylor Expan-

sion

In the present section, we give a general formulation of quantum derivatives

{dnf (A)/dAn} which do not depend on the deﬁnition of the diﬀerential df (A).

Our starting point of this general theory is that the diﬀerential hyperoperator “d”

satisﬁes the Leibniz rule (1.9) and that it is a linear hyperoperator.

(i) Quantum derivative and its invariance

Now we start with the following identity

when f (A) ∈ DA. Then, we have

Af (A) = f (A)A,

d(Af (A)) = d(f (A)A),

which is rewritten as

(dA)f (A) + Adf (A) = (df (A))A + f (A)dA,

(3.3)

using the Leibniz rule. This is rearranged as follows :

Adf (A) − (df (A))A = f (A)dA − (dA)f (A).

(3.4)

That is, we have

δAdf (A) = δf (A)dA.

This is our desired formula on the diﬀerential df (A).

In order to discuss the solution of Eq.(3.5), we rewrite Eq.(3.5) as

Obviously, df (A) has a linearity property with respect to f (A). Thus, the solution

df (A) of Eq.(3.6) is uniquely given in the form

δAdf (A) = −δdAf (A).

df (A) = δA→dAf (A),

(A − δA)n · dA = (dA) · An.

(3.11)

Thus, the second equality of Eq.(3.8) holds for f (A) ∈ DA.

11

Furthermore we can derive the following relation.

Lemma 2 : When f (A) ∈ DA, we have

δf (A) = f (A) − f (A − δA).

(3.12)

Using this lemma, we obtain

δf (A) = f (A) − f (A − δA)

Thus, summarizing Eqs.(3.5),(3.7),(3.8) and (3.14), we obtain the following

(3.13)

(3.14)

theorem on the diﬀerenial df (A).

Theorem I : When f (A) ∈ DA, we have

and consequently

for any choice of deﬁnitions of the diﬀerential df (A).

It should be noted that the ratio of the two hyperoperators δf (A) and δA is well
deﬁned for f (A) ∈ DA, as was discussed in the preceding section. We deﬁne10−12

the quantum derivative df (A)/dA in Eq.(1.8), namely

df (A) =

· dA.

(3.17)

df (A)
dA

12

That is, the derivative df (A)/dA is a hyperoperator which maps an arbitrary

operator dA to the diﬀerential df (A) given by Eq.(3.16). Thus, we arrive at the

following invariance theorem on the quantum derivative deﬁned in Eq.(3.17).

Theorem II (Invariance of Quantum Derivative) : When f (A) ∈ DA, the

quantum derivative df (A)/dA is invariant for any choice of deﬁnitions of the

diﬀerential df (A) satisfying the Leibniz rule, and it is given by

the choice of deﬁnitions of the diﬀerential df (A). This invariance has been also

discussed by Nazaikinskii et al9. in a diﬀerent formulation based on the Feynman

index method. The present conﬁrmation of the invariance is more direct and

transparent.

{dnf (A)/dAn}.

(ii) Higher derivatives and operator Taylor expansion

Now we discuss higher-order diﬀerentials {dnf (A)} and higher derivatives

(ii-1) Higher-order diﬀerentials and derivatives

The hyperoperator dA→B introduced in Eq.(2.22) is a derivation satisfying the

Leibniz rule (1.9). Thus, dA→B is a kind of diﬀerential hyperoperator, when

B = dA. We prove here the following theorem.

Theorem III: The nth diﬀerential dnf (A) is expressed by

dnf (A) = dn

A→dAf (A)

(3.19)

for any choice of deﬁnitions of the diﬀerential df (A), when f (A) ∈ DA.

The proof is given as follows. First note the following recursive formula10(3.21)

13

obtained by diﬀerentiating Eq.(3.5), namely

δAdf (A) = δf (A)dA

(3.20)

repeatedly.

Formula 6 : When f (A) ∈ DA, we have

This gives the following result :

Formula 7 : When f (A) ∈ DA, we have

δAdnf (A) = nδdn−1f (A)dA = −nδdAdn−1f (A).

(3.21)

dnf (A) = nδA→dAdn−1f (A) = n!δn

A→dAf (A),

(3.22)

using the hyperoperator δA→B = −δ−1

A δB introduced in Sec.II.

Here we have also used the relation df (A) = δA→dAf (A) given in Eq.(3.7).

Using Formula 5, namely Eq.(2.26), we arrive at Theorem III. This result means

that any diﬀerential hyperoperator d is generally expressed by

d = dA→dA

(3.23)

in the domain DA,dA.

Next we deﬁne10 the higher derivatives {dnf (A)/dAn} through the relation

dnf (A) =

dnf (A)
dAn

n

.

Here, dnf (A)/dAn denotes a hyperoperator which maps a set of the operators

(dA, · · · , dA) ≡: dA · - - - · dA to dnf (A). In an ordinary mathematical notation,

However, as was emphasized before10, the product form (3.24) is essential in the

present quantum analysis. That is, we use the product form (3.24) only when

the derivative dnf (A)/dAn is expressed explicitly in terms of A and the inner

derivations {δj} deﬁned by10

δj : dA · - - - · dA

= (dA)j−1(δAdA)(dA)n−j.

(ii-2) Integral representation of dnf (A)/dAn

Here we express dnf (A)/dAn explicitly in an integral form in terms of the above

inner derivations {δj}. Our result is given by the following theorem.

Theorem IV : When f (x) is analytic and f (A) ∈ DA, any higher derivative
dnf (A)/dAn exists uniquely for any choice of deﬁnitions of the diﬀerential df (A),

and it is given explicitly in the form

When f (A) = Ak, Eq.(3.31a) means that

δAdnAk = n(dn−1AkdA − dn−1(A − δA)kdA),

(3.31b)

which is equivalent by Formula 6 to saying that

dAdn−1Ak = dn−1(A − δA)kdA.

Proof of Formula 8 : Let hn,m(t; x, x1, · · · , xn) be the left-hand side of (3.33)

hn,m(t; x, x1, · · · , xn) = xhn,m+1(t; x, x1, · · · , xn) + hn−1,m(t; x − x1, x2, · · · , xn).

(3.34)

If we assume that hn−1,m(t; x, x1, · · · , xn−1) = 0 for all positive integers m and for

hn,m(t; x, x1, · · · , xn) = xhn,m+1(t; x, x1, · · · , xn).

Thus, we derive

dN
dtN hn,m(t; x, x1, · · · , xn) = xhn,m+N (t; x, x1, · · · , xn)
for any positive integer N . Thus, when f (x) is a polynomial of x, we have

(3.36)

hn,m+N (t; x, x1, · · · , xn) = 0 for a large N . Clearly we have

(3.38)

for any positive integers n and m. Therefore, when f (x) is a convergent power

series of x, we obtain Formula 8 by mathematical induction, because both sides

of Eq.(3.33) is linear with respect to the function f (x).

Thus, Theorem IV has been proven. An alternative proof of it is given in

IV. Multivariate Quantum Analysis

In this section, we formulate multivariate quantum analysis, in which we con-

sider a set of noncommuting power series {f (A1, · · · , Aq)} ≡ {f ({Ak})}. This

domain is denoted by D{Ak}, namely f ({Ak}) ∈ D{Ak}. If we start from a complex

number function f ({xk}), it is a problem how to deﬁne the operator function

f ({Ak}), as is well known in quantum mechanics. Here, we start from the opera-

tor function f ({Ak}) itself which is speciﬁed in some appropriate procedures such

as normal ordering.

given by

A deﬁnition of the partial diﬀerential djf ({Ak}) corresponding to Eq.(1.1) is

djf = lim
h→0

f (A1, · · · , Aj + hdAj, · · · , Aq) − f ({Ak})
h

.

(4.1)

18

Norm convergence of Eq.(4.1) can be discussed in a Banach space and strong con-

vergence is appropriate for unbounded operators. An algebraic partial diﬀerential

corresponding to Eq.(1.2) is given by

djf ({Ak}) = [Hj, f ({Ak})]

(4.2)

with some auxiliary operators {Hj}. Both satisfy the Leibniz rule. In the present

paper, we study general properties of multivariate quantum derivatives which are

invariant for any choice of deﬁnitions of diﬀerentials. This invariance can be easily

proved by extending the procedure shown in IIIA. Namely we have dj = δBjdAj;Aj
with Bj = −δ−1

Aj . The total diﬀerential df is deﬁned by
q

when f ∈ D{Ak}. The nth diﬀerential dnf is also deﬁned by

df =

djf = (

dj)f,

Xj=1

Xj

dnf = (

dj)nf.

(4.3)

(4.4)

Xj
Clearly, {dj} commute with each other, namely djdk = dkdj, in the domain D{Ak}.
One of the key points in the multivariate quantum analysis is to express dnf in

the form

dnf = n!

f (n)
j1,···,jn : dAj1 · - - - · dAjn.

(4.5)

Xj1,···,jn

Then, we study how to calculate the hyperoperators {f (n)

j1,···,jn} in Eq.(4.5).

(i) Ordered diﬀerential hyperoperator

In order to study f (n)

j1,···,jn, we introduce here an ordered diﬀerential hyperoper-

ator dj1,j2,···,jn as follows :

dj1,j2,···,jn = (dj1dj2 · · · djn)ordered,

(4.6)

which means dj1,j2,···,jnf ({Ak}) is given by those terms (found via the Leibniz rule)

of dj1dj2 · · · djnf ({Ak}) in which the diﬀerentials appear in the order dAj1dAj2 · · · dAjn.

19

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

For example, we consider an operator function f (A, B) = ABA2. Then we

have

dA,Bf = (dA)(dB)A2, dB,Af = A(dB)(dA2) = A(dB)[(dA)A + AdA],

dA,Af = (dA)BdA2, dB,Bf = 0.

Thus, using this ordered diﬀerential, we obtain the following formula.

Formula 9 : In the domain D{Ak}, we have

dj1 · · · djn =

dj1,···,jn.

XP

Here, ΣP denotes the summation all over the permutations of (j1, · · · , jn).

The proof will be self-evident. In particular, we have the following formulas.

Formula 10 : In the domain D{Ak}, we have djdk = dj,k + dk,j and

Formula 11 : In the domain D{Ak}, we have

j = n! dj,···,j

dnf = n!

dj1,···,jnf

Xj1,···,jn

for any positive integer n.

Under these preparations, we ﬁnd a procedure to calculate {f (n)

j1,···,jn} in Eq.(4.5).

In principle, they are obtained through the following relation :

f (n)
j1,···,jn : dAj1 · - - - · dAjn = dj1,···,jnf.

(4.11)

Here, dj1,···,jnf is expressed in the form

dj1,···,jnf =

fk,0(dAj1)fk,1(dAj2)fk,2 · · · (dAjn)fk,n

(4.12)

Xk

20

with some appropriate operators {fk,j}. In order to ﬁnd {f (n)

j1,···,jn} explicitly, we
have to rearrange Eq.(4.12) in the form of the left-hand side of Eq.(4.11). For this

purpose, the following rearrangement formula13 will be useful.

Formula 12 (Rearrangement formula) : Any product Q1f1Q2f2 · · · Qnfn can

be rearranged in the form

Q1f1 · · · Qnfn =

f1f2 · · · fj−1

∂π(j,j1)∂π(j1,j2) · · · ∂π(jk,n+1) : Q1 ·- - -·Qn (4.13)

n+1

Xj=1

π
X

with f0 = 1. Here, Σπ denotes the summation all over the ways of the following

division of the set of natural numbers (j, j + 1, · · · , n − 1, n) :

(j, j + 1, · · · , n − 1, n) = π(j, j1)π(j1, j2) · · · π(jk, n + 1),

(4.14)

and

π(j, k) = (j, j + 1, · · · , k − 1)

(4.15)

with j < j1 < · · · < jk ≤ n. Furthermore, the hyperoperator ∂π(j,k) is deﬁned by

∂π(j,k) = −δfjfj+1···fk−1;Qj,

(4.16)

using the partial inner derivation δf ;Qj ≡ δf ;j which operates only on Qj in (4.13).

The proof of Formula 12 is easily given by mathematical induction.

It will be instructive to give here some examples :

Q1f1 = (f1 − δf1) : Q1,

Q1f1Q2f2 = (f1f2 − f1δf2;2 − δf1f2;1 + δf1;1δf2;2) : Q1 · Q2,

Q1f1Q2f2Q3f3 = (f1f2f3 − f1f2δf3;3 + f1δf2;2δf3;3 − f1δf2f3;2

−δf1f2f3;1 + δf1;1δf2f3;2 + δf1f2;1δf3;3 − δf1;1δf2;2δf3;3) : Q1 · Q2 · Q3. (4.17)

(ii) Partial derivative and multivariate operator Taylor expansion

j1,···,jn,

(4.18)

using the hyperoperators {f (n)

we obtain the following theorem.

V. Auxiliary Operator Method

It will be convenient to introduce the auxiliary operators {Hj} satisfying the

[Hj, Hk] = 0, [Hj, Ak] = 0, [Hj, [Hk, Ak]] = 0,

for j 6= k

(5.1)

Equivalently, we have

In particular,

with d = Σjdj.

following conditions:

and

[Hj, [Hj, Aj]] = 0.

(5.2)

22

Using these auxiliary operators {Hj}, we introduce the following partial diﬀeren-

In particular, we have

and

The total diﬀerential df is given by

djf ≡ [Hj, f ] ≡ δHjf.

dAj = djAj = [Hj, Aj],

d2Aj = 0 and dj(dAk) = 0.

df ≡

[Hj, f ] = (

dj)f.

One of the merits of this auxiliary operator method is that we can easily obtain

the operator Taylor expansion as follows :

exp(

xjδHj)f ({Aj}) = f ({exp(xjδHj)Aj})

Xj
= f ({Aj + xjδHjAj}) = f ({Aj + xjdAj}),

using Eqs. (5.2) and (5.4). That is, we have

f ({Aj + xjdAj}) = exp(

xjδHj)f ({Aj}) = eΣjxj djf ({Aj}),

(5.8)

Xj

using the relation (5.3).

VI. Some General Remarks and Applications to Exponential Product

It will be instructive to remark that when the operator A depends on a param-

eter t, namely A = A(t), we have10

df (A(t))
dt

=

df (A(t))
dA(t)

·

dA(t)
dt

.

(6.1)

23

This formula insures again the invariance of the derivative df (A(t))/dA, because

df (A(t))/dt and dA(t)/dt do not depend on the choice of the diﬀerential df (A(t)).

Furthermore, we have

df (g(A))
dA

=

df (g(A))

It will be also interesting to note the derivative of hyperoperators. The ﬁrst

diﬀerential of a hyperoperator f (δA) is given by10

d(f (δA)dA) =

dt[f (1)(tδ1 + δ2) − f (1)(δ1 + tδ2)] : (dA)2.

Here, f (1)(x; x1 · · · , xn) denotes the ﬁrst derivative of f (x; x1 · · · , xn) with respect

to xk. Note that A and {δk} commute with each other. These formulas will be

also useful in proving Theorem IV. In fact, we obtain

Similarly we can derive Theorem IV using the above formula (6.5).

There are many applications of quantum analysis to exponential product formulas11−15

such as the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ formula.

For example, if we put

eA1(x)eA2(x) · · · eAr(x) = eΦ(x),

(6.7)

the operator Φ(x) is shown to satisfy the operator equation14

(6.13)

The feature of these formulas is that Φ(x) and log(eA1 · · · eAr) are expressed

only in terms of linear combinations of {Aj} and their commutators.

25

These formulas will be useful in studying higher-order decomposition formulas17.

VII. Summary and Discussion

In the present paper, we have uniﬁed an analytic formulation of quantum anal-

ysis based on the Gˆateaux diﬀerential and an algebraic formulation of quantum

analysis based on commutators, by introducing the two hyperoperators δA→B ≡
−δ−1

A B);A. This general theory of quantum analysis gives
a proof of the invariance of quantum derivatives for any choice of the deﬁnitions

A δB and dA→B ≡ δ(−δ−1

of diﬀerentials in the domain DA. This domain can be easily extended12 to the
region ˜DA which is a set of convergent Laurent series of the operator A in a Ba-

nach space. Multivariate quantum derivatives have also been formulated using

the rearrangement formula.

The present general formulation will be used eﬀectively in studying quantum

ﬂuctuations in condensed matter physics and it will be also useful in mathematical

physics. The present quantum analysis can also be extended to an inﬁnite number

of variables14. The quantum analysis has been also used15 in extending Kubo’s

linear response theory18 and Zubarev’s theory of statistical operator19 to more gen-

eral nonlinear situations11. The invariant property of quantum derivatives derived

in Sec.III is closely related15 to the general feauture of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation

theorem18−21. General quantum correlation identities are also derived15 using the

quantum analysis. For the convergence of unbounded operators, see the second

paper of Ref.17.

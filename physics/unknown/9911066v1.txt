The Rest Mass of the Hydrogen Atom from First Principles

Ernst Karl Kunst

The rest mass of the hydrogen ( H) atom in its ground state is calculated from
first physical principles and elementary geometric considerations.

Key Words: Equivalence of mass and time - masss of the hydrogen atom

Previously  has  been  shown  [1]  that  rest  mass  “m”  and  relativistic  mass  m’  =  m(cid:11)   -0
where (cid:11)  is the Lorentz factor (1 - v /c )
 based on composite velocity v  [2] - must be
of  like  origin  (are  equivalent)  and  hence  the  former  seems  to  be  generated  by  the
movement  of  a  fourth  spatial  dimension  of  matter  relative  to  a  fourth  dimensional
manifold  R ,  in  which  our  R -world  is  embedded.  This  implies  that  -  apart  from  a
numerical factor - the following must be valid

where E means rest energy. As is widely known does the first term mc  of the right-
hand  side  express  the  rest  mass  and  the  second  term  mv /2  the  classical  kinetic

energy of the material particle under consideration. Thus, the third term 3mv /(8c )
must  be  the  energy,  which  is  due  alone  to  the  relativistic  expansion  of  the  moving
material particle [2]. Therefore, if rest mass is generated by the movement of (cid:27)  relative
to R  at velocity c it must be valid 3mc /8 = (cid:27) /c or

m   the  mass  of  the  gravitational  field,  G  the  gravitatonal  constant  and  R  the  radial
distance  from  the  center  of  the  body.  Therefore,  the  integrated  mass  of  the  sub-
microscopic  H-atom in our medioscopic world must be composite of the central rest

mass (3) of the atom and the surrounding (gravitational) field vacuum. The mass of the
gravitational field cannot be calculated straightforwardly, because there is no means to
determine  a  boundary  of  R.  But  if  the  mass  of  the  field  vacuum  of  the  H-atom  is
compared  with  the  mass  of  the  gravitational  field  of  a  body  of  equal  density  but
different mass, according to (5) the ratios

where R  = a  is the first Bohrian radius. Calculation delivers 1,673559 × 10  g, which
fits exactly the experimental result [3].
It seems that (7) denotes the exact value of the rest mass of the smallest possible,
electrically neutral and durable piece of matter - as seen from our medioscopic level.
Of  course,  the  theory  delivers  no  explanation  yet  of  the  masses  of  the  elementary
particles.  Presumably those masses are due to a hitherto not yet understood layered
structure of space-time on the sub-microscopic level.

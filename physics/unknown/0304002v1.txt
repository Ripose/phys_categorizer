Q factor in numerical simulations of DPSK with 
optical delay demodulation

Abstract—A  simple  model  is  used  to  estimate  the  Q  factor  in 
numerical  simulations  of    differential  phase  shift  keying  (DPSK) 
with  optical  delay  demodulation  and  balanced  detection.  It  is 
found  that  an  alternative  definition  of  Q  is  needed  for  DPSK  in 
order  to  have  a  more  accurate  prediction  of  the  bit  error  ratio 
(BER).

I.  INTRODUCTION 

D 

IFFERENTIAL  PHASE  SHIFT  KEYING  (DPSK)  was 
studied in the early days of optical fiber communications 
[1-4].  Recently,  direct-detection  (no  local  oscillator)  DPSK 
has  attracted  much  attention  for  applications  in  high  bit-rate 
wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) systems, and studies 
were carried out both numerically [5-7] and experimentally [8-
10]. Using DPSK, a transmission distance of 4,000 km at 42.7 
Gb/s bit-rate has been demonstrated [10]. 

It  is  well-known  that  in  a  linear  channel  DPSK  has  a 
receiver  sensitivity  advantage  over  on-off  keying  (OOK)  by 
approximately  3  dB  with  optical  delay  demodulation  and 
balanced detection [11-14]. However, to our knowledge, such 
benefit of balanced detection has not been properly taken into 
account in DPSK numerical simulations published so far. For 
example,  it  was  reported  in  [5]  that  “at  the  level  of  the 
practical  optical-signal-to-noise  (OSNR)  regime,  balanced 
detection  gives  only  marginal  improvement”,  which  seems  to 
contradict  the  results  of  earlier  theoretical  and  experimental 
studies of DPSK. 

We  note  that  one  challenge  in  numerical  simulations  is  to 
provide  a  reliable  estimate  of  the  BER.  To  save  the 
computation  time,  a  typical  simulation  program  uses  only 
hundreds of bits, and therefore, the BER is usually not counted 
directly  but  estimated  by  evaluating  the  statistical  fluctuation 
in the received signal. In simulations of OOK, such fluctuation 
is often characterized by a Q factor defined as

levels  of  “1”  and  “0”,  and  s 1+s 0  is  the  sum  of  the  standard 
deviations of the intensities around the levels of “1” and “0”. 
Based on the Gaussian approximation for the noise distribution 
in  the  received  signal,  one  can  derive  the  relation  between 
BER and Q, i.e.,

For OOK, it is known that this method coincidentally gives a 
fairly  good  prediction  of  the  BER,  although  the  noise 
distribution  in  the  intensity  domain  is  not  exactly  Gaussian 
[11]. However, as will be explained in this Letter, direct use of 
(1)  and  (2)  in  simulations  of  DPSK  may  lead  to  wrong 
prediction  of  the  BER  even  in  the  linear  regime.  This  is  not 
due  to  the  patterning  effect  which  has  been  discussed  before 
for  OOK  [15],  but  due  to  the  fundamentally  non-Gaussian 
nature  of  the  noise  distribution  in  the  output  signal  of  the 
DPSK balanced receiver. 

In  Sec.  II,  we  present  a  simplified  model  for  a  rigorous 
analysis  of  the  BER  in  DPSK  and  show  how  the  Q  factor 
definition (1) can be modified to predict the BER consistently. 
In Sec. III, we consider the effect of the nonlinear phase noise, 
which is the dominating nonlinear penalty in DPSK [16].  

 

II.  DPSK IN A LINEAR CHANNEL 

In  a 

linear  optical 

transmission  system  with  optical 
amplifiers, the field of N return-to-zero (RZ) pulses at the end 
of the transmission can be expressed as

where  w c  is  the  angular  frequency  of  the  optical  carrier,  T  is 
the bit period, u(t-nT) is the envelope function of the RZ pulse 
in the n-th timeslot, an is the (complex) amplitude of the n-th 
pulse,  and  z(t)  represents  a  classical  additive  Gaussian  noise 
(the  optical  noise  with  a  different  polarization  will  be 
neglected  for  simplicity).  For  DPSK,  the  information  is 
encoded in a relative phase change of the signal amplitude an 
with  respect  to  the  previous  symbol  an-1.  In  this  Letter,  we 
choose  an=  – 1,  a  digital  “0”  will  be  represented  by  a  phase 
change of p  or an = - an-1, and a digital “1” will be represented 
by no phase change or an = an-1. 

To  optimize  the  receiver  performance,  in  front  of  the 
receiver  we  use  a  matched  optical  filter  with  an  impulse

It can be easily proven that 2s 2 is equal to the power spectral 
density  N0  of 
the  unfiltered  white  noise  z(t)  (single 
polarization), although this is not critical for this Letter.  

The  filtered  DPSK  signal  can  then  be  decoded  with  an 
optical  delay  interferometer  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  optical 
output  of  the  delay  interferometer  is  either  a  constructive 
interference  or  a  destructive  interference  depending  on  the 
relative  phase  between    fn  and    fn-1.  The  signals  measured  by 
the two photodiodes are

We  note  that  the  above  expression  represents  the  “inner 
product”  of  two  vectors  associated  with  the  two  complex 
quantities fn and fn-1. Depending on the relative sign of an and 
an-1, Ibal is either around Eb (for “1”) or around - Eb (for “0”), 
and  the  decision  level  is  at  zero.  The  BER  is  the  probability 
for  Ibal  to  have  a  wrong  sign.  Using  the  Gaussian  probability 
density  function  (PDF)  of  xn  and  yn  ,  one  can  calculate  the 
BER analytically. The result of the calculation is

which agrees with earlier results for an ideal DPSK system [1, 
13].  We  further  note  that  (15)  is  only  valid  for  DPSK  with 
balanced  detection.  If  only  one  output  of 
the  delay 
interferometer  (I+  or  I- )  is  used  for  direct  detection,  the 
performance of DPSK would degrade by approximately 3 dB 
and become equivalent to OOK. 

Now  we  compare  the  analytical  BER  result  (15)  with  what 
one  would  obtain  by  estimation using the Q factor defined in 
(1). From (14), we find the balanced receiver output Ibal »
 – Eb, 
  2Eb.  Since  xn  and  xn-1  are 
corresponding  to 
independent,  we  find  that  the  standard  deviation  of  Ibal  is

If this Q factor were used in (2), the predicted BER would be 
much too worse (by approximately 3 dB) than the correct BER 
expression (15). 

(16) 

 .   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In order to predict the BER more accurately, we propose to 
estimate Q in DPSK simulations by evaluating the variance of 
the  field  amplitude  |fn|  before  the  delay  interferometer.  We 
introduce an alternative "amplitude-Q", or QA, defined as 
f

When we substitute QA for Q in (2), we find the BER result is 
consistent with (15) except for a less important factor in front 
of the exponential function. We note that QA is larger than the 
result of (16) by a factor of  2  (or 3 dB). 
 

III.  EFFECT OF NONLINEAR PHASE NOISE 

So  far  we  have  restricted  our  discussion  to  the  linear  case. 
As  the  optical  power  increases,  the  above  theory  on  BER 
estimation  will  eventually  break  down.  One  such  nonlinear 
effect  is  the  Gordon-Mollenauer  phase  noise  which  limits the 
performance of DPSK at high power levels [16]. In that case,  
QA  may  be  an  overestimate  of  the  performance  and  is  no 
longer reliable. 

When  the  BER  is  dominated  by  the  such  excessive  phase 
noise,  we  find  it  helpful  to  evaluate  Q  directly  in  the  phase 

domain.  Using  polar  coordinates

assumption  that  the  fluctuation  of 
distribution. Although the exact distribution of the phase noise 
remains 
the  Gaussian 
approximation of the phase noise seems to capture the essence 
of the phase noise problem relatively well. For example, using 
this  model  we  find  that  the  nonlinear  phase  noise  starts  to 
impact  the  system  performance  when  the  total  accumulated 
nonlinear  phase shift of a WDM channel is on the order of 1 
radian,  as  predicted  by  [16].  More  studies  on  the  nonlinear 
phase noise will be published elsewhere [17]. 
We note that in the low power regime QD

f  is larger than QA 

by  a  factor  of 

  (or  ~  0.9  dB),  and  the  BER  is  still

dominated by QA. To take into account the contributions from 
both  amplitude  noise  and  phase  noise  as  we  vary  the  optical 
power levels in DPSK simulations, we choose the smaller one 
from QA and QD

f  as the overall Q for the BER estimation. 

 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

We have shown that in numerical simulations of DPSK, the 
Q factor should be defined in the field domain, in contrast to 
the usual practice for OOK. Although we have discussed only 
an ideal case with matched filter detection, the principle can be 
generalized  to  more  realistic  systems  with  sub-optimum 
receivers.  In  addition,  the  excessive  phase  noise  must  be 
considered 
the  Kerr 
nonlinearity  of  the  fiber  plays  a  role.  The  exact  nature  of  the 
noise distribution due to nonlinearity is yet to be explored.

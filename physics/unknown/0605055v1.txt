Abstract 
 
The  perfect  lens  property  of  a  dispersive  and  lossy  left-handed  metamaterial  (LHM)  disk  is 
exploited to superimpose a source of electromagnetic radiation onto its mirror image, formed 
as  a  result  of  reflection  from  a  perfect  electric  conductor  (PEC)  or  a  perfect  magnetic 
conductor  (PMC).  The  superposition  of  a  vertical  wire-dipole  antenna  with  its  PEC-image 
results in an increase of the radiation resistance of the antenna compared to that of an antenna 
emitting in free space. On the other hand, if the same antenna is coupled to a PMC-image it is 
shown that the result is the formation of a non-radiating configuration. The finite-difference 
time-domain (FDTD) analysis is performed and this allows a detailed characterization of the 
systems.  It  is  shown  that  the  non-radiating  system  allows  relatively  large  amounts  of 
electromagnetic  energy  to  be  stored  in  the  LHM-disk  and  that  is  indicative  of  strong 
electromagnetic  fields  inside  the  material.  This  property  is  employed  in  a  second-harmonic 
generation  (SHG)  process  and  the  potential  of  a  non-radiating  configuration  as  an  efficient 
nonlinear device is demonstrated.

1. Introduction 

Non-radiating configurations [1-7] are time-dependent charge-current distributions that do not 

radiate electromagnetic energy. Trivial systems – e.g. an antenna in a Faraday cage – are of no 

interest. The early work on the subject ([1] and the references therein) appeared in the early 

days  of  atomic  physics  and  it  was  related  to  the  question  of  stability  of  atoms.  The  general 

conditions under which a charge-current distribution does not radiate electromagnetic energy 

have been derived already [1, 2]. It has been shown that the fundamental non-uniqueness of 

the solution of the inverse source problem – the problem of reconstructing the mathematical 

form of a wave-source from the fields it generates outside its own volume – is, in fact, due to 

the existence of non-radiating components [3]. Therefore, additional information, in the form 

of a constraint, is necessary in order to reconstruct a source from the field it generates. Using 

the  “minimum  energy”  constraint,  source  decomposition  into  a  sum  of  non-radiating  and 

purely  radiating  components  has  been  demonstrated.  In  addition  the  question  of  possible 

optimization of antenna performance, by manipulating its non-radiating component, has been 

also discussed [4].  

Non-radiating  systems  can  be  constructed  by  combining  toroidal  and  supertoroidal 

solenoids with electric and magnetic dipoles. The ability of some of these systems to generate 

time-dependent electromagnetic potentials in the absence of electromagnetic fields has been 

investigated [5-7]. Such systems can be used as detectors for the permittivity of the ambient 

matter [8, 9].  

The “superlens” property of the LHMs [10] can be exploited to create a non-radiating 

system  [11-14].  A  frequency-domain  analysis  [11-13],  carried  out  analytically,  can  give  a 

detailed picture of the distribution of both the propagating and the evanescent electromagnetic 

field components. On the other hand, FDTD embodies the advantage that features too difficult 

(or impossible) to deal with analytically can be included in the model. Besides, it also yields a

system  analysis  in  terms  of  observable  quantities  like  input  impedance,  radiation  resistance 

and loss resistance [14].  

 

An  important  outstanding  question  concerns  the  possible  applications  that  non-

radiating  systems  might  have.  In  this  connection,  it  should  be  emphasized  that  it  is  not  the 

mere absence of radiation that attracts the attention. Rather it is the unique field configuration, 

formed “inside” any non-radiating system. It is clear, therefore, that suitable system designs 

are  needed  in  order  to  assess,  on  a  practical  level,  the  potential  of  these  systems  for 

applications  and  device  construction.  One  way  of  addressing  this  issue  is  to  realize  that  the 

condition for absence of radiation [1, 2] is a relation between the system parameters and the 

parameters of the ambient environment. Hence, any deviation from this condition stimulates 

radiation.  This  possibility  has  been  explored,  partially,  [8,  9,  14],  where  the  application  of 

non-radiating systems as sensitive detectors has been demonstrated.  

 

Here radiating and non-radiating systems, based on LHMs are considered. It is shown 

that the radiation resistance of a wire-dipole antenna can be increased or decreased, by using 

the “perfect lens” property of the LHMs to effectively superimpose the antenna onto its mirror 

image. The latter is formed as a result of a reflection from a PEC, or PMC boundary. Also, by 

using  a  non-radiating  system,  the  efficiency  of  a  second  harmonic  generation  process, 

resulting from the presence of diodes introduced into the LHM [15], is investigated and the 

outcome shows the advantage provided by the non-radiating system.  

2. System design and principle of operation 

Figure  1  illustrates  how  LHMs  can  be  used  to  control  the  radiation  properties  of  a  vertical 

wire-dipole  antenna.  Basic  image  theory  (see  e.g.  [16])  states  that  the  electromagnetic  field 

created by a source emitting near a PEC, or PMC, mirror can be presented as a superposition 

of the field of the source and the field created by its image [Figs. 1 (a) and 1 (b)]. Without loss 

 

 

3

of  generality  vertical  wire-dipoles  with  azimuthal  symmetry  are  considered.  Horizontal 

dipoles can be used as well [12]. The mirror images of vertical dipoles are dipoles of the same 

magnitude  and  in  the  case  of  a  PEC  point  in  the  same  direction,  whereas  for  a  PMC  their 

direction  is  reversed.  If  the  antenna  is  relatively  far  (on  a  wavelength  scale)  from  the 

boundary, the presence of the latter affects the radiation pattern of the antenna but has very 

little  effect  on  the  radiation  resistance.  The  total  emitted  power  is  that  of  the  same  antenna 

emitting  in  free  space.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  antenna  is  close  to  the  boundary  the  total 

emitted power must take into account the presence of the boundary. Hence, if an infinitesimal 

electric dipole is placed on a PMC-surface this action will, effectively, superimpose the dipole 

and its image (Fig. 1(c)). In this case no power is emitted at all. In contrast, placing the same 

dipole on a PEC-surface leads to doubling the antenna radiation resistance as compared with 

that of the same antenna emitting in free space (Fig. 1(d)). Both the situations shown in Fig. 1 

(c)  and  (d)  are  known  from  antenna  theory.  Even  though  a  vertical  electric  dipole  emitting 

close to a PMC surface (or, equivalently, a horizontal electric dipole emitting close to a PEC-

surface)  form  non-radiating  configurations,  these  particular  systems  are  nevertheless  trivial 

and of no interest, since the fields they create are zero everywhere. On the other hand LHM-

driven non-radiating systems are capable of creating large (on a wavelength scale) volumes of 

non-propagating fields and are likely to find applications. This type of system can be used as a 

sensitive detector [14]. 

 

The  LHM  permits  the  creation  of  a  non-radiating  property  of  a  vertical  dipole  on  a 

PMC surface without bringing the dipole into contact with the surface as Fig. 1(e) shows. An 

LHM disk of thickness D with 

Re

( )
−=ε

1

 and 

Re

(
)

−=µ

 is used here. This situation, shown 

in Fig 1(e), is equivalent to the situation depicted in Fig. 1(c). The explanation of this outcome 

derives from the fact that an LHM disk with an effective permittivity and permeability both 

equal to -1 is, in fact, an electromagnetic annihilator. The meaning of the latter term becomes 

 

4

apparent when it is realized that any changes attained by the electromagnetic field as a result 

of  propagation  in  a  slab  of  free  space  of  thickness  D  will  be  undone  (annihilated)  by  a 

subsequent propagation in a slab of LHM of the same thickness with an effective refractive 

index equal to -1. Thus, as far as electromagnetic field is concerned, the antenna is effectively 

located on the surface. This results in no radiation being emitted, according to Fig. 1(c). At 

the  same  time  it  is  clear  that  a  non-propagating  electromagnetic  field  exists  in  the  volume 

between the antenna and the disk shown in Fig. 1(e).  

The same “annihilation” property of the LHM disk produces the equivalence between 

the systems shown in Fig. 1(d) and Fig. 1(f). In this case coupling the antenna with its image 

yields an increase of the antenna radiation resistance.  

The  PMC  boundary  is  a  fictitious  but  useful  concept.  Physically  the  effect  can  be 

created  by  placing  a  pair  of  identical  dipoles  fed  with  π-out-of-phase  voltages  in  the  focal 

points  of  the  LHM  disk  [13,  14].  Another  way  to  suppress  the  radiation  is  to  abandon  the 

PMC in favor of a single horizontal dipole located above a LHM disk sitting on a PEC surface 

[12]. Note, however, that an actual PMC-like metamaterial has recently been reported [17]. 

3. Results and discussion 

The systems shown in Fig. 1(e) and Fig. 1(f) are modeled with the FDTD method [18]. The 

LHM disk of radius 

LR  and thickness D is the isotropic homogenized outcome of an array of 

wires and an array of split-ring resonators [19-21]. Such homogenization permits the use of an 

effective relative permittivity and permeability functions of the material, given by

the wires in a cubic lattice [20]. In (1) and (2) ω is the excitation angular frequency, 

pω  is 

the  effective  plasma  frequency, 

0ω   is  the  resonant  frequency,  ν  and  γ  are  the  loss 

parameters  and  F  is  the  filling  factor.  A  thin-wire  model  [22]  has  been  employed  for  the 

center-fed  wire-dipole  antenna  of  radius

DL .  This  model  has  the 

advantage that it makes no assumptions for the current  distribution  along  the  antenna.  With

FDTD model of the dispersive and lossy LHM, with  ε and  µ given by (1) and (2) can be 

found in [23]. The accuracy of the simulation is controlled by monitoring the extent to which 

the energy conservation law  

is satisfied. In (3),

and

Figure  2  shows  the  input  resistance 

inR ,  the  radiation  resistance 

radR   and  the  loss 

resistance 

lossR   for  the  non-radiating  system  shown  in  Fig.  1(e).  Provided  that  the  antenna 

length  DL  is smaller than the thickness of the LHM slab, the radiation resistance of the system 

remains  a  small  fraction  of  the  input  resistance.  This  means  that  the  input  power  is  almost 

entirely absorbed by the material, with only a small amount of it being radiated. As Fig. 2(b) 

shows, in the absence of the LHM disk, the PMC boundary by itself has practically no impact 

 

6

on the input resistance of the antenna. Note that the distance between the center of the antenna 

and the PMC boundary is 

2 =D

λ5.1

 and this is sufficiently far away. If the antenna length is 

greater  than  the  thickness  of  the  LHM  disk,  then  the  coupling  between  the  antenna  and  its 

image  is  only  partial  and  the  result  is  that  the  current  distribution  in  the  antenna  becomes 

highly asymmetric.  

 

According  to  Fig.  2  the  system  shown  in  Fig.  1(e)  has  a  nearly  zero  radiation 

resistance. If the PMC plate is replaced by a PEC plate (Fig. 1(f)) an increase of the radiation 

resistance  is  expected,  since  in  this  case  the  image  of  the  dipole  is  a  dipole  pointing  in  the 

same direction. Indeed, placing an infinitesimal vertical dipole directly on a PEC surface (Fig. 

1(d)) increases the radiation resistance of the dipole by a factor of two. The same upper limit 

for the relative increase of the radiation resistance of a finite dipole emitting over a LHM disk 

in  contact  with  a  PEC  plate  is  expected.  The  results  for  the  normalized  input  and  radiation 

resistance of such a system presented in Fig. 3 show severe limitation by losses in the disk. In 

fact, for the parameter values chosen, the presence of the LHM disk offers no advantage in 

comparison  with  a  dipole  antenna  placed  directly  on  top  of  the  PEC  plate  (the  curve 

inR , 

contact).  Decreasing  the  thickness  of  the  LHM  disk  from 

λ75.0=D

  to 

λ5.0=D

,  indeed, 

produces  a  higher  radiation  resistance.  However,  the  increase  of  the  loss  resistance  is  even 

stronger.  Note  the  decrease  of  both  the  normalized  input  resistance  and  the  normalized 

radiation resistance for antenna lengths greater than the LHM thickness. This is because the 

complete superposition of the antenna and its image is no longer possible. The increase of the 

radiation resistance of a system of two identical emitters, coupled by a slab of an LHM has 

been  reported  recently  [14].  As  shown  here  this  can  be  explained  by  the  effective 

superposition of the two sources (or the source and its image) ensured by the LHM slab.  

The  radiation  enhancement  and  radiation  suppression  properties  demonstrated  so  far 

offer a straightforward way to test experimentally the ability of a given sample of an LHM to 

 

 

7

create a “perfect” image of a realistic radiation source, such as a wire-dipole antenna. Placing 

the sample on a PEC plate and measuring the input resistance and the radiation resistance of a 

vertical and a horizontal dipole antenna, and then comparing the data with that obtained in the 

absence  of  the  LHM  will  provide  a  quick  assessment  of  the  quality  of  the  sample  of  the 

metamaterial.  An  attempt  to  “measure”  the  image  of  the  antenna  directly  would  require 

collecting and processing a three dimensional array of data and this is not an easy task.

permeability functions given by (1) and (2) is [23]

are the electric field, magnetic field, polarization and magnetization vectors, respectively.  

 

In order to compare the amount of electromagnetic energy stored into the LHM disk, 

expressions  (5)  and  (6)  have  been  integrated  over  the  volume  of  the  disk  for  a  radiating 

system Fig. 1(f) and a non-radiating system Fig. 1(e). The results are presented in Fig. 4. The 

energy stored in the LHM in the absence of a PMC, or PEC plate is also shown. The input 

power is the same in all three cases. Figure 4 shows that the amount of energy stored in the 

LHM  is  largest  for  a  non-radiating  system.  This  outcome  is  intuitively  acceptable.  The 

characteristic  time  of  the  formation  of  the  “non-radiating  state”  is  large  in  comparison  with 

the period T of the excitation frequency. The relatively  large  amount  of  stored  energy  is  an 

 

8

indication  that  strong  electromagnetic  field  can  be  created  inside  the  LHM  disk  by  using  a 

non-radiating system. This suggests the possible use of a non-radiating system as a non-linear 

device.  To  illustrate  this,  an  LHM  disk  with  second-order  nonlinearity  is  considered.  It  has 

been shown [15] that by connecting diodes to the split-ring resonators of the metamaterial an 

effective, second-order, non-linear magnetization is induced. Detailed analysis of the second 

harmonic  generation  process  in  a  left-handed  metamaterial  has  been  presented  [24].  Here  a

is  used.  Figure  5  compares  the  second  harmonic  generation  efficiency  for  a  non-radiating 

system “LHM and PMC”, radiating system “LHM and PEC” and for a LHM disk irradiated 

by the same antenna without PEC, or PMC plate. The second-harmonic power depends upon 

the square of the input power, but the efficiencies of the conversion process are quite different 

for  the  three  devices.  The  non-radiating  system  offers  a  clear  advantage,  giving  the  highest 

efficiency,  as  Fig.  5  shows.  This  can  be  associated  with  the  strong  non-propagating  fields 

existing in the material in full accordance with Fig. 4. This suggests a possible application of 

a non-radiating configuration as a parametric amplifier.  

The advantage in the conversion efficiency, provided by the non-radiating system, is 

illustrated  in  Fig.  6  where  the  magnetic  field  distributions,  created  by  each  of  the  systems 

considered  are  plotted.  Note,  that  the  non-radiating  system  generates  the  highest  amount  of 

second harmonic power although the amount of input – fundamental frequency power – is the 

field 

lowest.

4. Conclusions 

The perfect lens property of the LHMs has been exploited to couple a wire dipole antenna to 

its  mirror  image.  Both  PEC  and  PMC-mirrors  have  been  considered.  It  is  shown  that  with 

vertical antennae the PMC mirror results in a non-radiating configuration, whereas the PEC 

mirror  stimulates 

radiation.  The  non-radiating  system  allows 

large  amounts  of 

electromagnetic  energy  to  be  stored  in  the  metamaterial  and  this  indicates  that  strong  non-

propagating  electromagnetic  field  exists  in  this  case.  The  latter  suggests  the  use  of  non-

radiating systems as non-linear devices. The advantage provided by such systems in a second-

harmonic generation process is demonstrated.

Figure 1. Non-radiating and radiating systems formed by coupling a vertical electric dipole to 
its  mirror  image.  The  images  formed  by  a  PMC-  (a)  or  a  PEC-mirror  (b)  are  dipoles  of  the 
same  magnitude:  inverted  (PMC)  or  non-inverted  (PEC).  Infinitesimal  dipole  on  a  PMC 
surface (c) does not radiate whereas the presence of a PEC surface (d) will double its radiation 
resistance. A slab made of an LHM of thickness D with an index of refraction equal to -1 is 
used to superimpose a dipole of finite length onto its mirror image: (e) PMC and (f) PEC.

has no impact on the antenna radiation resistance.

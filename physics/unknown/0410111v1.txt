Abstract. Two-fluid  flowing  equilibrium  configurations  of  a  helicity-driven  spherical  torus  (HD-ST)  are  numerically
determined  by using  the combination  of  the  finite  difference and  the  boundary element  methods.  It  is  found  from  the 
numerical results that electron fluids near the central conductor are tied to an external toroidal field and ion fluids are not. 
The magnetic configurations change from the high-q HD-ST (q>1) with paramagnetic toroidal field and low-(cid:69) (volume
average (cid:69)(cid:3)value,  <(cid:69)> 2  %) through  the  helicity-driven  spheromak and  RFP  to  the  ultra low-q  HD-ST  (0<q<1)  with
diamagnetic toroidal field and high-(cid:69) (<(cid:69)> 18 %) as the external toroidal field at the inner edge regions decreases and
reverses the sign. The two-fluid effects are more significant in this equilibrium transition when the ion diamagnetic drift 
is dominant in the flowing two-fluid.

INTRODUCTION

During  coaxial  helicity injection,  toroidal  ion flow  related  to  a  rotating  toroidal  mode  number n=1  magnetic
structure has been  observed  in  many  helcity-driven  spherical  torus (HD-ST)  experiments  such  as  CTX, HIST,
SPHEX,  SSPX,  HIT,  and  NSTX.  The n=1  mode  structure  is  considered  to be playing  an  essential  role  in driving
current on closed flux surfaces of the HD-ST. On the HIT experiments [1], it is found that the n=1 mode is locked to 
electrons and not to ions, suggesting a rotating magnetic field current drive. Because of this feature, the equilibrium 
computation of a HD-ST is required to take into account two-fluid effects [2-3]. The two-fluid effects are expected
to explain the stability of high-(cid:69)ST. However, the details of how such the flowing two-fluid model affects the MHD
equilibrium configurations of the HD-ST are not numerically investigated.

The  purpose  of  this  study is to  numerically determine  the  two-fluid flowing  equilibria  of  the  HD-ST  and  to
investigate  their  fundamental  properties. We  focus our  attention on  contribution of  the  ion  flow  to  the  magnetic
configuration, the two-fluid effects, and (cid:69)values. The formalism for flowing two-fluid equilibrium is developed by
Steinhauer, Ishida and co-workers [4]. It is an extension of the MHD equilibrium problem for a non-flowing single-
fluid which is governed by the Grad-Shafranov equation. The axisymmetric equilibrium of the flowing two-fluid is
described by a pair of second-order partial differential equations for the magnetic and ion flow stream functions, and
Bernoulli equation for the density [4]. By applying the two-fluid formulation to the HD-ST equilibrium with purely
toroidal  ion flow,  we  modify  the  non-flowing  single-fluid  equilibrium  code  [5]  which  computes  the  HD-ST 
equilibrium in the more realistic region including the spherical flux conserver (FC) and the coaxial helicity source
(CHS) of HIST [6]. In this code, the equilibrium computation of the HD-ST reflects the realistic condition that the 
bias coil flux penetrates the FC wall and the electrodes. In order to solve the governing equations of the flowing two-
fluid  equilibrium,  we  employ  the finite difference  and  the  boundary  element  methods  as  the  numerical  approach
incorporating this boundary condition.

NUMERICAL MODEL

For  numerical  computation,  we  model  the more  realistic  region  including  the  FC  and  the  CHS  of  HIST.
According to HIST geometry, the spherical FC is 1.0 m in diameter. The FC adjoins the CHS. The CHS consists of
the  outer  electrode  (0.276  m  in  diameter,  0.35  m  in  length),  the  inner  electrode (0.18  m  in  diameter, 0.309  m  in
length),  and  the  outer  bias  coil  (0.362  m  in  diameter,  0.3  m  in  length)  of rectangular  cross  section.  The  central
conductor (0.114  m  in  diameter)  is  inserted  along  the  symmetry axis.  Insertion  of  a  toroidal field  coil  current Itf
along the geometry axis inside the central conductor produces an external toroidal field. In Fig. 1 we show the model
of the FC and the CHS which will be used in this paper. We divide the region in which the equilibrium is determined
into three subregions, (cid:58)1, (cid:58)2, and (cid:58)3. In the HIST experiment, the bias field is generated long before the plasma is
injected  into  the  FC.  Thus, the  bias  field  penetrates  the FC  wall,  the  electrodes,  and the  central  conductor,  and
extends  all  over  the  space  when  the  equilibrium  configuration  is  formed. On  the  other hands,  the  lifetime  of  the
plasma is much shorter than the resisitive penetration time of the FC, the inner electrode, and the central conductor
and it is much longer than that of the outer electrode. Therefore, we assume that the magnetic field generated by the
plasma current penetrates the outer electrode and that it does not penetrate the FC wall, the inner electrode and the
central conductor.

Let  us use  a  cylindrical  coordinate system  (r, (cid:84), z)  in which  the z-axis lies  along  the symmetry  axis  of  HIST
geometry. Since the two-fluid flowing equilibrium configuration of the HD-ST plasma is axially symmetric, we can

Here n denotes the unit vector whose direction is outward normal to the boundary. The boundary condition for (cid:60)e on
the surface (cid:42)c is obtained by setting at an unknown constant. After the linearization of Eqs. (1) and (2), the problem
can be solved numerically by means of the combination of the finite difference and the boundary element methods
[5]. This computation is performed so that the total toroidal current It is constant.

The magnetic field profiles on the midplane are shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2(a) shows the case of small ion flow
(CHi1=1.0)  and  the high-q  ST  with  paramagnetic  toroidal  field Bt  profile. We  indicate  the flow velocity u and  the
safety factor q later. As the effect of the ion flow becomes more significant, the external toroidal field Bt.e decreases
and further reverses its sign. Figure 2(b) shows the spheromak configuration without Bt.e. In Fig. 2(c), Bt at the edge
regions reverses the sign, which indicates the RFP-like configuration. Eventually, Bt at the whole regions reverses
the sign as shown in Fig. 2(d). The magnetic configuration then changes to the ultra low-q ST with diamagnetic Bt
profile.

and blue lines indicate the toroidal field, the external toroidal field, and the poloidal field, respectively.

The flow velocity profiles on the midplane are shown in Fig. 3. It is found from Fig. 3(a) that the toroidal current
is dominantly carried by the electron fluids. The electron fluids at the inner edge region are tied to Bt.e while the ion
fluids are not. Figure 3(c) shows the electron flow at the inner edge region reverses the sign due to the reversal of Bt.e
at the inner edge region. As the effect of the ion flow becomes more significant, the reversed region of the toroidal
electron flow extends as shown in Fig. 3(d).

The toroidal current density profiles on the midplane are shown in Fig. 4. As the effect of the ion flow becomes
larger, the toroidal current density changes from the hollow profile to the peaked one. Further, due to the reversal of
the toroidal electron flow, it reverses the sign at the inner edge region.

We show the safety factor q as a function of the normalized poloidal flux function

of the ion flow becomes larger, the q-value comes down and reverses the sign at the inner edge region. Finally, it
reverses the sign at the whole region, and becomes the ultra low-q (0<q<1).

The polodal  flux  contours  are  shown  in Fig. 6.  All  these  flux surfaces  have  the open flux penetrating  the
electrodes, and form the helicity-driven configurations. This suggests the possibility of the current drive by coaxial
helicity injection. As the effect of the ion flow becomes more significant, the amount of closed flux increases. The
HD-STs have significantly lower <(cid:79)> values than the helicity-driven spheromak and RFP. Note that the ultra low-q
HD-ST with diamagnetic Bt and high-(cid:69) appears in the regime of <(cid:79)> value lower than the lowest eigenvalue (cid:79)e=9.29

uitmax increases with the transition of the high-q HD-ST to the helicity-driven RFP, <(cid:69)> increases due to the decrease
in Bt.e. On the other hand, <(cid:69)> gradually decreases as uitmax increases from the helicity-driven RFP to the ultra low-q
HD-ST. It is also found from Fig. 7(b) that except for the region of negative uitmax, all the values of f2F are larger than
unity. In the region of slow ion flow, f2F has a sharply peaked value (uitmax=0.032).

CONCLUSIONS

We  have  investigated  the  two-fluid  effects  on  the  MHD  equilibrium  configurations  of  the  HIST  HD-ST. 
Conclusions obtained in this paper are summarized as follows. 1) Equilibrium of the HD-ST based on the two-fluid
model with flow in the region including the FC and CHS are numerically determined by using the finite difference
and  the boundary  element  methods. 2)  The  magnetic  configurations  change from  the high-q  HD-ST  (q>1)  with
paramagnetic toroidal field and low-(cid:69) (<(cid:69)> 2 %) through the helicity-driven spheromak and RFP to the ultra low-q
(cid:124) 18 %) as the external toroidal field at the inner 
HD-ST (0<q<1) with diamagnetic toroidal field and high-(cid:69) (<(cid:69)>
edge regions decreases and reverses the sign. 3) In the ultra low-q HD-ST, the toroidal field reverses the sign, but the
poloidal field does not do it. Thus, it is different from the flipped ST observed in the experiment. Also, the ultra low-
q HD-ST  appears  in  the regime  of  <(cid:79)>  value  (<(cid:79)>=  -0.673  m-1)  lower than  the  lowest  eigenvalue (cid:79)e  =9.29  m-1.
Therefore, it could be observed in the experiment. 4) The two-fluid effects are more significant in this equilibrium
transition when the ion diamagnetic drift is dominant in the flowing two-fluid.

The fundamental properties of the HD-ST equilibrium based on the two-fluid model with flow outlined here are 
generally  very  available  for predicting what  equilibrium  configuration  is  formed  in  the  HD-ST  experiment.  There
are further  issues related  to the  equilibrium  of  the  ultra low-q  HD-ST:  1)  Can  the generalized  helicities  conserve
during this equilibrium transition? 2) How do we experimentally drive a flow of Alfven Mach number MA (cid:124) 0.7 for
producing  the  ultra  low-q HD-ST? 3)  Stability  analysis  of  the flowing  two-fluid  equilibrium  of the  HD-ST  is 
required.

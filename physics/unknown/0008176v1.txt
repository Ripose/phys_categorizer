Abstract 

The  peak  current  limit  for  the  Fermilab  Linac 
was  recently  studied.  The  purpose  was  to  learn  what 
components of the present Linac can be used for the first 
stage of a proposed proton driver[1]. For this application 
the Linac must provide a H- beam in excess of 5000 mA-
m sec per pulse. The original Fermilab Linac was designed 
for  protons  with  a  peak  current  of  75  mA  and  a  pulse 
length of four Booster turns (~10 m sec). The high energy 
replacement  was  designed  for  a  peak  current  of  35  mA 
and  a  beam  pulse  length  of  50  m sec.  The  present  H- 
source cannot deliver more than ~80 mA which produces 
55  mA  in  the  Linac.  Using  a  proton  source  allows  the 
system  to  be  tested  to  currents  of  ~100  mA  and  pulse 
lengths long enough to observe the effects of long pulses. 
This test has shown that the present Linac can accelerate 
beam having a peak current up to ~85 mA with beam loss 
comparable to the present Linac operation (~45 mA). The 
results of the test will be presented. 

1  INTRODUCTION 

current  at  the  end  of  the  Linac  was  between  28  and  36 
mA.  Since  the  energy  upgrade  there  have  been  small 
changes  in  operating  parameters  of  the  ion  source,  low 
energy  transport  line  and  Linac  that  have  resulted  in  a 
steady  increase  in  peak  beam  current extracted from the 
Linac. Figure 1 shows the peak beam current in the Linac 
and  corresponding  Booster  beam  intensity  over  the  past 
thirty years of operations. In the constant quest for higher 
beam  intensity  and  considering  that  the  side-coupled 
structure was design for a maximum beam current of 35 
mA, the intensity at 400 MeV has been greatly increased.

2  SYSTEM MODIFICATION 

Figure 1. Linac and Booster intensity with time  

During its lifetime the Fermilab Linac has gone 
through  two  mayor  modifications.  In  both  cases  these 
improvements  were  motivated  by  the  need  for  higher 
beam 
synchrotron. 
Construction of the Linac began in 1968 and a 200-MeV 
proton beam was first produced on November 30, 1970. 
The design goal[2] of 75 mA and 10 m sec (four Booster 
turns) was achieved quickly and surpassed. Although the 
design  intensity  was  75  mA,  the  Linac  was  built  to 
accelerate  at  least  100  mA with similar beam emittance. 
Emittance  preservation 
for  successful 
horizontal  injection  and  stacking  of  four  turns  in  the 
Booster. Eight years later the proton source was replaced 
by a H- source to accelerate a long, low-intensity H- beam 
of 25 mA and build intensity in the Booster using multi-
turn charge-exchange injection. In the summer[3] of 1993 
the  Linac  was  upgraded  again.  The  last  four  drift-tube 
tanks were removed and a side-coupled structure installed 
to  increase  the  final  energy  to  400  MeV.  The  higher 
injection  energy  in  the  Booster  increased  the  magnetic 
guide  field  at  injection,  reduced  the  frequency  range  of 
the  RF  accelerating  system  and  increased  the  Booster’s 
space-charge  limit  at  injection  and  therefore  its  possible 
intensity.  Although  the  Linac  energy  upgrade  was 
designed  for  a  peak  beam  current  of  35  mA,  typical

Obtaining  the  anticipated  current  using  an  H-  source 
would  have  required  a  significant  source  development 
program  which,  in  part,  was  the  purpose  of  this  study. 
Therefore  an  old  proton  source,  a  duoplasmatron,  was 
reinstalled 
the  Cockcroft-Walton  pre-
accelerators. This source once produced several hundred 
milliamperes  for  short  pulse  (3-5  m sec)  200-MeV  Linac 
operation and could easily provide a proton beam with a 
current  for 
test.  Other  modifications  required 
changing  the  polarity  of  the  preaccelerator  high  voltage 
and  magnetic  transport  dipoles.  Also  the  750-keV  input 
and 400-MeV output transport lines had to be retuned for 
protons.  The  750-keV  transfer  line  is  short.  It  has  only 
three quad triplets and a Buncher cavity. The polarity of 
the  quads  were  kept  as  for  H-  operation.  A  Trace2D 

in  one  of 

this 

model was used to tune the line, see Figure 2. This model 
was  also  used  to  show  that  the  line  has  sufficient 
flexibility  to  match  to  the  Linac  with  no  change  in  the 
Linac polarities or settings. 

result  of  gain  and  feed-forward  adjustments.  The  feed-
forward correction compensates for beam loading starting 
at  the  head  of  the  beam  pulse  and  lasting  through  the 
duration of the pulse.

3  COURSE OF TEST 

H-  operating  conditions  for  beam  transmission  and 
capture  in  the  low-energy  linac  is  74%  and  95%  in  the 
high-energy linac. Thus there is a loss of ~30% that must 
be accommodated by the source.

It  was  assumed  that  all  limits  on  beam  current  will  be 
visible for a beam pulse between 10 to 30 m sec. Sparking 
rates in the side-couple modules were monitored for any 
increase,  as  were  the  amplitudes and reflected power on 
the  each  RF  station.  The  beam  loss  monitors  were 
carefully  watched  at  all  times.  All  high  peak  current 
related measurements were done with a minimal number 
of pulses. Figure 3 shows the RF gradient envelope and 
reflected power signals for Station 7 of the side-coupled 
linac. Red traces are RF signals with beam. Yellow traces

These  signal  were  watched  for  signs  of  RF  saturation 
during high peak current running. Similar RF signals for 
the low-energy linac tanks were watched. Figure 4 shows 
a  low-energy  gradient  and  reflected  power  signal  with 
and  without  beam.  This  portion  of  the  Linac  was 
originally design for higher peak currents. The dip in the 
signal is present only during beam time and is a result of 
beam 
loading 
compensation. Every attempt is made to keep the gradient 
signal constant during beam time.

Energy variation during the pulse can be observed at the 
end of the Linac following a spectrometer magnet. These 
variations  are  believed  due  to  the  variation  of  the 
gradients  along  the  drift-tube  linac.  Figure  5  shows  the 
horizontal  position  of  the  beam  during  the  pulse.To 
insure  that  the  emittance  of  the  high  current  beam  from 
the  source  was  not  degraded,  the  beam  emittance  at  the 
entrance to the Linac was measured, see Table 1. Clearly, 
the  beam  emittance 
rather  constant  and  not 
significantly  dependant  on  the  beam  current  for  values 
between 78 and 92 mA. This is important because there 

is 

was significant change in the beam loss going from 85 to 
95 mA or higher. Figure 6 shows toroids and beam loss 
monitors along the Linac for a current of ~85 mA.

3  SUMMARY 

A proton beam with a peak current up to 90 mA 
was accelerated through the Linac with similar losses as a 
lower intensity H- beam. For currents above 90 mA there 
is additional loss with indications that this loss is related 
to  a  large  energy  spread  and  lack  of  RF  voltage  to 
properly accelerate the beam and keep it in the bucket. It 
is believe that the present Fermilab Linac can accelerate 
up  to  90  mA  of  H-  beam  for  future  uses with a suitable 
source.

The  authors  would  like  to  acknowledge  the 
work of several people who were instrumental in carrying 
out  this  test. Although the test was relatively simple the 
preparation  and  restoration  of  the  Linac  was  extensive. 
From the Linac, James Wendt and Ray Hren prepared the 
source,  its  installation  and  later  removal;  Lester  Wahl 
assisted  with  RF  monitoring  and  control.  From  the 
Mechanical  group,  Danny  Douglas,  Mike  Ziomek  and 
Ben Ogert prepared and restored the Cockcroft-Walton.

Abstract 

Two approximations are frequently used in statistical physics: the first one, which we shall 

name the mean values approximation, is generally (and improperly) named as “maximum 

term  approximation”.  The  second  is  the  “Stirling  approximation”.  In  this  paper  we 

demonstrate that the error introduced by the first approximation is exactly compensated by 

the second approximation in the calculation of mean values of multinomial distributions. 

 

I-Introduction. Use of  approximations. 

In  the  traditional  formulation  of  statistical thermodynamics  it  is  of  common use the 

application of two approximations: the first one is the improperly named  “maximum term 

approximation”,  and  is  customarily  followed  by  the  “Stirling  approximation”.  We 

consider  that  the  first  approximation  is  improperly  named  bacause  the  procedure  it 

prescribes is just to replace the number of occurrences of the events of interest, ni , by its 

mean value, 

in . 

In this note we show that the mentioned approximations has the remarkable property 

of exactly compensate the errors introduced by each other, irrespectevely of the value of 

the numbers ni, in the calculation of the mean value of  random variables. 

II- Approximation using the mean values of ni. 

Let  us  consider  the  random  variable  X  wich  can  assume  the  value  x1,  x2,...xR,  with 

probabilities p1, p2,...pR.. Its mean value is: 

m1= p1x1 + p2x2+ ……+ pRxR

Let  us  consider  now  the  random  variable  YN  ,  sum  of  N  independent  random 

variables with the same probability distribution as X. Its first  moment will be:    

     YN = N m1. 

 

 

 

(2) 

If  we  now  calculate  the  first  moment  YN  using  the  multinomial  probability  of  the 

occurrence of n1 results x1 , n2 results x2 , etc, we obtain the following expression:

The “maximum term approximation” supposes that this sum may be approximated by 

one term in which the variables ni are replaced by their mean values, 

in  = pi N. We obtain 

then the first approximation for

III-The Stirling approximation  

If we now apply on expression (4) the approximation ln (s!) = s ln s – s we obtain for 

the second approximation to

That  is  to  say,  we  obtain  again  the  exact  value  (note  that  the  same  result  would  be 

obtained if we use simply ln (s!) = s ln s). 

We  have  demonstrated  the  following  theorem:  “The  approximation  ln  (s!)  =  s  ln  s 

compensates  exactly  the  errors  introduced  by  the  approximation  that  uses  the  mean 

values”

Abstract 

Results from previous laboratory experiments indicate that both the protonated water 

dimer  H3O+(H2O),  and  molecular  cluster-ions,  X+(H2O)n  absorb  infra-red  (IR) 

radiation  in  the  water  vapour  continuum  region  between  4-14µm  (2500-714cm-1). 

Protonated water clusters are a common species of atmospheric molecular cluster-ion, 

produced  by  cosmic  rays  throughout  the  troposphere  and  stratosphere.  Under  clear-

sky  conditions  or  periods  of  increased  atmospheric  ionisation,  such  as  solar  proton 

events, the IR absorption by atmospheric ions may affect climate through the radiative 

balance. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry in a long path cell, of  path length 

545m has  been used to detect  IR  absorption by  corona-generated positive molecular 

cluster-ions.  The  column  concentration  of  ions  in  the  laboratory  spectroscopy 

experiment  was  estimated  to  be  ~1013  m-2;  the  column  concentration  of  protonated

atmospheric  ions  estimated  using  a  simple  model  is  ~1014  m-2.  Two  regions  of 

absorption, at 12.3 and 9.1µm are associated with enhanced ion concentrations. After 

filtering  of  the  measured  spectra  to  compensate  for  spurious  signals  from  neutral 

water vapour and residual carbon dioxide, the strongest absorption region is at 9.5 to 

8.8 µm (1050 cm-1 to 1140 cm-1) with a fractional change in transmissivity of 0.03 ± 

0.015, and the absorption at 12.5 to 12.1 µm (800 cm-1 to 825 cm-1) is 0.015 ± 0.008.

1. Introduction: atmospheric ionisation 

The  electrical  conductivity  of  air  is  sustained  by  continual  ionisation  from  cosmic 

rays.  Cosmic  rays  are  highly  energetic  particles  that  enter  Earth’s  atmosphere  from 

space. The number of ions created by cosmic rays depends on air’s interaction cross-

section, which is proportional to its density. Many primary cosmic ray particles pass 

through the thin ionosphere and mesosphere without encountering any  air molecules 

to ionise, but at a pressure surface of 100-200 hPa, (in the upper troposphere or lower 

stratosphere),  the air density is  sufficiently high  for the  primaries  to  collide with  air 

molecules  (Sandström,  1965).  These  collisions  form  a  cascade  of  secondary 

subatomic  particles,  which  lose  energy  through  causing  ionisation  events  as  they 

propagate downwards. The peak cosmic ray atmospheric ionisation rate occurs at the 

layer where the secondary particles are produced, and decreases down to the surface, 

where cosmic ionisation rates are ~2 cm-3s-1. Ionisation close to the terrestrial surface 

is enhanced by the emission of natural radioactive gases, such as radon, from the soil 

 

 

 

2 

so  that  the  total  surface  ionisation  rate  is  ~10  cm-3s-1.  Above  the  boundary  layer, 

~1km, the ion concentration increases with altitude.  

Ionisation  of  a  gaseous  air  molecule  such  as  N2 produces  a  primary  air  ion  e.g.  N2

+ 

and an electron. The electron quickly attaches to another molecule to give a negative 

primary  ion.  Primary  ions  become  stable  by  reacting  with  other  atmospheric 

molecules, and through charge-driven clustering with polar molecules like water and 

ammonia  (Harrison  and  Carslaw,  2003).  Atmospheric  ions  are  charged  molecular 

clusters,  usually  X+(H2O)n  or  Y-(H2O)n  (common  species  are  listed  in  Harrison  and 

Carslaw  (2003)).  Atmospheric  ions  are  sufficiently  mobile  to  permit  electric  current 

flow in response to a potential difference, and form the fair weather conduction part of 

the  global  electric  circuit.  Between  the  ionosphere  and  surface,  a  net  conduction 

current  flows  of  density  ~2  pAm-2.  The  electrical  conductivity  of  tropospheric  and 

stratospheric air σ is related to the total bipolar ion number concentration n, and the 

mean ionic mobility µ. Typically, atmospheric cluster-ions have µ~1 cm2V-1s-1 and a 

radius  of  0.5  nm  (e.g.  Hõrrak  et  al,  2000).  Ion  number  concentrations  n  in  the 

atmosphere  depend  on  a  balance  between  the  ionisation  rate  and  the  number 

concentration of any aerosol present.  

Whilst  many  aspects  of  terrestrial  atmospheric  electricity  have  been  studied 

quantitatively  for  over  two  centuries,  understanding  of  the  relevance  of  atmospheric 

ionisation to climate through the radiative balance has only recently begun to develop. 

Discussion of the topic has increased following evidence that cosmic rays could affect 

climate  (Carslaw  et  al,  2003).  Connections  between  cosmic  ray  ionisation  and 

changes in radiative properties have been suggested on many timescales, from half a 

 

 

 

3 

billion years (Shaviv, 2002) down to a few minutes (Harrison and Aplin, 2001). One 

postulated mechanism is that ions formed by  cosmic rays enhance the abundance  of 

particles  that  may  act  as  condensation  nuclei  for  cloud  formation.  This  ion-induced 

particle formation is plausible in Earth’s atmosphere (e.g. Vohra et al, 1984), but the 

quantitative  links  between  it  and  cloud  formation  are  not  yet  firmly  established. 

Another mechanism is that the potential of the ionosphere could be changed by long-

term  variations  in  cosmic  rays,  modifying  the  conduction  current  and  charges  on 

clouds (Harrison and Carslaw, 2003). However, making the necessary measurements 

to  confirm  or  refute  both  these  effects  is  difficult,  and  the  hypotheses  are  primarily 

supported  by  models  (Lovejoy  et  al,  2004;  Yu  and  Turco,  2001;  Tripathi  and 

Harrison, 2001).  

This  paper  investigates  a  further  mechanism  by  which  cosmic  ray  ionisation  could 

modulate  radiative  processes:  the  infra-red  (IR)  absorption  of  atmospheric  ions. 

Following laboratory studies by Carlon (1982) in which artificially produced charged 

clusters  absorbed  IR  radiation  in  a  long  path  cell,  Aplin  (2003)  suggested  that  this 

process  should  be  expected  to  exist  in  the  atmosphere.  Direct  absorption  of  IR 

radiation by ions is another potential mechanism by which heliospheric changes could 

affect Earth’s radiative balance through modulation of cosmic ray ion production. It is 

likely that this effect is usually dominated by more significant changes,  for example 

IR  emission  from  clouds.  However  it  is  well  known  that  under  some  conditions 

atmospheric  ionisation  can  increase  by  orders  of  magnitude,  and  in  these  cases  IR 

absorption  could  become  more  significant.  For  example  during  solar  proton  events, 

energetic solar particles can produce 1032 atmospheric ions at ionisation rates of 600-

800  cm-3s-1  (Bazilevskaya  et  al,  2000).  If,  as  occasionally  happens,  these  solar 

 

 

4 

particles penetrate downwards through the entire atmospheric column to the surface, 

there  is  a  greater  chance  of  a  detectable  radiative  effect.  This  presents  a  further 

motivation to determine the magnitude of charged cluster absorption. Another reason 

is to permit accurate assessment of the neutral cluster contribution to the water vapour 

continuum absorption, which is still poorly understood. 

This  paper  describes  laboratory  experiments  designed  to  identify  and  quantify  the 

presence of IR absorption by ion clusters typical of those present in the atmosphere. 

Evidence  for 

the  atmospheric  IR  absorption  of  cluster-ions,  and  suggested 

mechanisms  are  discussed  in  section  2.  Laboratory  spectroscopy  experiments  using 

artificially  enhanced  ion  concentrations  to  increase  the  IR  absorption  of  charged 

clusters are described, and the results and data analysis presented in section 3. Finally, 

the significance of the findings is assessed in section 4.  

2. Infra-red absorption by cluster ions 

The IR atmospheric radiative properties of the  water molecule result from rotational 

and  vibrational  transitions  of  its  molecular  bonds  (e.g.  Houghton,  2002).  There  also 

exists a poorly understood weak IR absorption in the 8-50 µm (200-1250 cm-1) region, 

with  pressure  and  temperature  dependency  greater  than  any  known  water  vapour 

absorption. This anomaly between accepted theory and observations is referred to as 

the  IR  continuum  problem.  The  possible  presence  of  atmospheric  water  dimers, 

(H2O)2, is a long-established explanation for the properties of the IR continuum region 

(Bignell,  1970).  Recent 

theoretical  work 

implies 

that  atmospheric  clusters, 

 

 

 

 

5 

particularly  dimers  and  trimers,  exist  in  sufficient  concentrations  to  account  for  the 

continuum (Goldman et al, 2001; Evans and Vaida, 2000).  

2.1 Laboratory experiments 

Asmis et al (2003) confirmed the IR signature of charged water clusters by observing 

protonated  water  dimer  H3O+(H2O)  absorption  at  6-14  µm  (1666-714  cm-1).  The 

absorption  mechanism  is  by  hydrogen  bond  transitions,  similar  to  those  responsible 

for  the  IR  absorption  of  neutral  clusters.  Carlon  (1982)  used  a  radioactive  source  to 

generate  charged  water  clusters  in  a  humid  atmosphere  and  demonstrated  that  this 

mixture  of  species  showed  IR  absorption  bands  between  4-13  µm  (2500-746  cm-1) 

over path lengths of 50-100m. Ion concentrations were ~104-106 cm-3 giving column 

concentrations  of  ~1011-1014  m-2.  Carlon  and  Harden  (1980)  hypothesised  that  the 

attachment and recombination reactions between the different clusters caused the  IR 

absorption signal. 

2.2 Absorption by atmospheric ions 

As  was  discussed  in  Section  1,  hydrated  molecular  clusters  are  formed  in  the 

atmosphere  by  cosmic  ray  ionisation.  The  protonated  water  cluster  H3O+(H2O)n  is  a 

common  atmospheric  ion  species,  and  many  positive  and  negative  ion  clusters  are 

partially or  completely  hydrated.  The  existence of a  size distribution of atmospheric 

ions  is  well  established,  through  both  mass  spectrometry  (Eisele,  1988),  and  ion 

mobility  spectra  (Hõrrak  et  al,  2000).  Attachment  and  recombination  reactions 

between charged atmospheric species are also well known (e.g. Harrison and Carslaw, 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

2003),  and  contribute  to  the  variability  of  the  ion  mobility  spectrum.  Therefore  it 

appears reasonable to expect at least some atmospheric ion species to absorb in the IR 

continuum region.  

As  mentioned  in  Section  1,  the  atmospheric  ion  concentration  varies  with  height 

because  of  changing  ionisation  rates  throughout  the  atmosphere.  Near  the  surface, 

radioactive  emissions  from  the  ground  dominate,  so  the  ionisation  rate  decreases 

slightly within the boundary layer. Above about 1 km the cosmic ray ionisation rate 

increases  with  height  up  to  ~30  km,  after  which  it  is  limited  by  decreasing 

atmospheric  density.  The  ionisation  rate  parameterisation  of  Makino  and  Ogawa 

(1985) has been used to estimate the positive ion column concentration n+, for which 

there  is  most  evidence  for  IR  absorption  (Asmis  et  al,  2003),  in  an  aerosol-free 

atmosphere  up  to  50  km.  The  calculation  assumes  that  ion  concentrations  are  only 

limited  by  self-recombination  with  coefficient  α  so  the  positive  ion  concentration

  where  q  is  the  ionisation  rate  (see  Eq  2  in  Section  3.2).  The 

assumption that self-recombination dominates over attachment to aerosol particles is 

restricted  to  the  troposphere  and  above,  as  atmospheric  aerosol  concentrations  are 

negligible  outside  the  boundary  layer.  Ionisation  rate  q  depends  on  geomagnetic 

latitude, which modulates cosmic ray penetration into the atmosphere. In this example 

a  geomagnetic latitude of 50º has  been assumed  to  give  an  average  estimate  for  ion 

concentration,  which  is  highest  near  the  geomagnetic  poles  and  lowest  at  the 

geomagnetic equator. Typical ion pair production rates are shown in Figure 1a, with 

the estimated positive ion profile in Figure 1b. Integrating over 50 km to obtain an ion 

 

 

7 

column concentration, as shown in Figure 1c, gives a column concentration of ~1014 

m-2, which is proportional to the positive electrical conductivity of air in the column. 

The vertical column concentration of dimers, which are thought to account for much 

of  the  water  vapour  continuum  is  ~1022-1023  m-2  (Vaida  et  al,  2001).  As  this  is  six 

orders of magnitude greater than the estimated column abundance of ions, it is almost 

certain that any IR absorption from ions would only contribute a small fraction of the 

water  vapour  continuum  absorption  under  the  standard  conditions  represented  by 

Figure  1.  However,  the  distribution  of  atmospheric  ion  species  is  not  well  known, 

particularly  in  the  free  troposphere,  and  may  be  very  sensitive  to  atmospheric  trace 

gas concentrations, aerosol concentrations and ionisation rates. Furthermore, dramatic 

increases in ion concentrations can be expected during periods of strong solar activity. 

For  these  reasons,  laboratory  experiments  have  been  developed  to  measure  ionic  IR 

absorption  at  high  ionisation  rates  with  the  aim  of  estimating  the  magnitude  of  the 

atmospheric signal.  Laboratory experiments  are  not  completely  representative  of  the 

many  complex  atmospheric  feedback  processes  and  cannot  conclusively  prove  the 

existence  of  an  atmospheric  effect.  However,  results from experiments  in controlled 

conditions  can  provide  valuable  constraints  for  subsequent  atmospheric  experiments 

by estimating magnitudes and sensitivities over a range of conditions.

3. Molecular spectroscopy experiments 

3.1 Methodology 

The spectroscopy  experiments in this section were  all  carried  out  at the  UK Natural 

Environment  Research  Council  (NERC)  Molecular  Spectroscopy  Facility  (MSF), 

located  at  the  Rutherford  Appleton  Laboratory  (RAL).  The  MSF  long  path-length 

absorption cell (LPAC) at RAL (Ballard et al, 1992) is a 9-metre long stainless-steel 

vessel  containing  multi-pass  reflective  optics  (White,  1942)  for  broadband  high-

resolution spectroscopy at long optical path-lengths of up to ~1 km. As the maximum 

LPAC  path  length  is  much  shorter  than  vertical  tropospheric  path  lengths,  any 

integrated  signal  from  natural  surface  ion  concentrations  would  be  smaller  than  an 

integrated atmospheric signal from a vertical column. A corona ion source was used 

to artificially enhance the ionisation rate q and compensate for the short path length.  

Positive  corona  was  selected,  as  the  strongest  evidence  for  IR  absorption  is  for 

positive  ions  (Asmis  et  al,  2003;  Carlon,  1982).  A  Programmable  Ion  Mobility 

Spectrometer  (PIMS)  (Aplin  and  Harrison  2000,  2001)  was  used  to  measure  ion 

concentrations  inside  the  LPAC. Using  artificial  air  (to be described in section 3.3), 

the  LPAC  temperature  and  humidity  can  be  kept  relatively  constant,  and  IR 

absorption  spectra  can  be  compared  with  the  corona  source  activated  and  disabled. 

The relative locations of PIMS, ion source and environmental sensors in the cell are 

shown in Figure 2.

3.2 Ion generation and detection 

The PIMS instrument is fully computer controlled and incorporates compensation for 

temperature-dependent  leakage  currents  (Aplin  and  Harrison,  2001).  For  this 

application,  the  PIMS  sensing  capacitor  was  inserted  inside  the  LPAC,  with  air 

sucked out of the LPAC into the PIMS. A flexible metallic pipe was attached to the 

exhaust  of  the  PIMS  to  permit  recirculation  of  air  back  to  the  LPAC.  The  LPAC  is 

constructed  of  ~10mm  thick  stainless  steel,  and  screens  out  much  of  the  ionisation 

from natural radioactivity. For this reason, the ambient positive conductivity of air in 

the cell  (proportional to  the number of  positive ions;  see Eq 1 below), is 3-6  fSm-1, 

lower  than  typical  urban  outdoor  values  of  ~10  fSm-1  (Aplin  and  Harrison  2000, 

2001).  

The positive ion corona source used an Applied Kilovolts HP10P 10kV 1mA positive 

high  voltage  supply,  connected  to  8  sharp  stainless  steel  electrodes  of  tip  diameter 

~1mm  to  geometrically  generate  the  high  electric  fields  required  for  corona 

generation. A 24V 80mm dc fan was mounted above the corona electrodes to circulate 

the ions generated throughout the spectroscopy cell; it had no other effects on the ion 

concentrations  measured  during  the  experiment.  The  corona  source  current  was 

monitored, and the voltage applied to the electrodes could also be controlled. Corona 

onset was at ~3.6 kV for the duration of this experiment. The  corona source current 

started  to  increase  non-linearly  and  the  positive  ions  measured  also  increased 

immediately, once the corona onset voltage was reached, as shown in Figure 3a. This 

is caused by local breakdown of the air producing positive air ions and electrons. The 

electrons immediately  attach to other  air  molecules  to form negative air  ions,  which 

 

 

 

10 

recombine  with  the  positive  corona  electrode  resulting  in  unipolar  positive  ion 

production. (The positive ions are then stabilised by clustering with water molecules, 

as described in Section 1.) Only the generation of corona ions could be responsible for 

the  synchronous  non-linear  increases  in  both  positive  ion  concentration  and  corona 

current, as the two measurements were independent. This effect was found to occur at 

a repeatable value of corona voltage. 

The PIMS instrument was originally optimised for natural outdoor ion concentrations, 

and its femtoammeter was saturated by the much greater concentrations of artificially 

produced corona ions. Rather than reduce sensitivity at ambient ion concentrations by 

modifying the PIMS femtoammeter, a Keithley 487 picoammeter was used to detect 

the ions at the PIMS sensing electrodes, instead of the femtoammeter included in the 

PIMS  sensing  electronics  (Harrison  and  Aplin,  2000).  Positive  air  conductivity 

calculated from measurements using the Keithley picoammeter, with and without the 

corona  source,  is  shown  in  Figure  3b.  Ion  measurements  were  sampled  at  1Hz  and 

logged  using  the  RS232  interface  (PIMS  femtoammeter)  or  the  GPIB  IEEE-4888 

interface (Keithley 487 picoammeter). 

The  ion  measurements  can  be  verified  by  comparing  ion  production  rates  estimated 

using  two  independent  techniques:  (1)  from  the  measured  conductivity  and  ion-

aerosol theory, and (2) from the current  leaving  the  corona  source.  The  positive  ion 

concentration can be estimated from the positive conductivity and mobility from

. 

Eq 1 

The minimum mobility of ion entering the PIMS sensing capacitor is a function of the 

applied field, sensor geometry and air flow rate (Aplin and Harrison, 2000), and was 

 

 

 

 

11 

calculated to be 0.58 cm-2V-1s-1. If inserted into Eq 1, this can be used to estimate an 

upper limit on the ion concentration of 106 cm-3. In aerosol-free air the steady state ion 

concentration n is related to the ionisation rate q by a recombination coefficient α (1.6 

x 10-6 cm3s-1) (e.g. Harrison and Carslaw, 2003) 

 

q α=
2n

. 

Eq 2 

If the air in the tank is assumed to be free of aerosol particles, then Eq 2 gives the ion 

production rate as ~1.6 x 106 cm-3s-1. The current from the corona source can be used 

to  independently  estimate  an  ion  production  rate  by  calculating  the  number  of 

electrons required to produce the measured corona current (2.25 µA), divided by the 

volume of the tank (~ 4 m3). This order of magnitude estimate suggested a corona ion 

production  rate  of  ~2.5  x  106  cm-3s-1,  which  is  within  a  factor  of  2  of  the  ion 

production rate estimated from the measured ion concentration. It also indicates that 

the  corona  source  is  <100%  efficient  at  ion  production,  which  is  expected  from 

leakage currents within the corona source circuitry, or because not all the corona ions 

generated  are  detected  due  to,  for  example,  losses  to  the  LPAC  walls.  It  is 

conservative  to  assume  that  the  ion  concentration  in  the  LPAC  can  be  measured  to 

±50%. 

 

 

If a constant  corona source voltage  was used,  then both  the  corona  currents  and the 

measured 

ion  concentrations  were  repeatable,  Figure  3b.  The  spectroscopy 

experiments were carried out at a corona current of 2.25  µA, corresponding to ~106 

ions cm-3. This was close to the threshold current for corona emission for this source. 

Whilst using higher currents would have increased the signal, they were not used in 

this  experiment  for  two  reasons:  firstly  because  of  the  increased  likelihood  of  trace 

gases being produced by the corona  (this will be discussed in more detail in section 

12 

3.3),  and  secondly  to  reduce  any  capacitative  coupling  effects  from  the  very  high 

electric fields generated from the clouds of space charge inside the LPAC. 

3.3 Spectroscopy  

The spectra were measured on a Bruker IFS 120HR Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 

spectrometer  at  a  resolution,  defined  as  (0.9/maximum  optical  path  difference),  of 

0.03cm-1 (0.3nm at 10 µm) over a spectral range of 500-4000cm-1 (2.5-20 µm).  The 

spectrometer  employed  a  silicon  carbide  globar  source  operating  at  approximately 

1000K,  a  germanium/potassium  bromide  (Ge/KBr)  beamsplitter  and  a  broadband 

mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector,  optimal  for  this  wavelength  range.   For 

each spectrum 200 scans were co-added taking just over 1 hour.   

The optical system of the LPAC provides very long absorption paths through the gas, 

or mixture of gases, contained in the inner vessel.  It comprises three spherical mirrors 

of  305  mm  diameter  and  8.000  m  radius-of-curvature.  The  configuration  is  a 

modification of the simple ‘White’ multi-pass optics design (White, 1942), described 

by Bernstein and Herzberg (1948), in which a side extension (tab) on the field mirror 

allows  the  number  of  non-overlapping  images  that  can  be  stacked  across  the  field 

mirror to be doubled, hence doubling the optical pathlength.  Each mirror is mounted 

on kinematic adjusters that allow tilt and focus adjustments to be made from outside 

the  LPAC  when  the  inner  vessel  is  evacuated  or  filled  with  gas,  and  at  any 

temperature.  Thus the absorption path length can be adjusted from the minimum of 

32.75 m to over 1 km, in steps of 32.00 m.  The longest optical pathlength achievable 

depends on the mirror reflectivity for the wavelengths of interest.  For this work gold 

 

 

 

 

13 

coated mirrors providing broadband, high reflectivity (>98%) in the infrared spectral 

region allowed a pathlength of 544.75m.  The LPAC was fitted with KBr windows to 

allow the spectrometer to be connected to the LPAC using  a fully evacuated optical 

path  to  avoid  absorption  by  atmospheric  water  vapour  and  carbon  dioxide.  Ionic 

column concentrations in the cell were ~1013 m-2. 

As the PIMS was designed for use at ambient air pressure, the LPAC was filled with 

synthetic  air  by  pumping  with  a  throttled  rotary  pump  from  the  centre  of  the  cell 

whilst maintaining a flow of 79% nitrogen / 21% oxygen mix (Air products Zero Air) 

over  a  water  bath  to  humidify  the  artificial  air,  into  one  end  of  the  LPAC.  

Unfortunately  a  small  amount  of  natural  air  remained,  which  caused  some  residual 

carbon  dioxide  absorption.  The  relative  humidity  and  temperature  of  the  gas  mix 

inside  the  LPAC  were  measured  using  humidity  and  temperature  sensors  (Vaisala 

Type HMP234) mounted inside the LPAC and in direct contact with the gas, one at 

each end.  The pressures of gas samples contained in the LPAC were measured using 

a high precision Baratron capacitance gauge system with a 1330 hPa full-scale sensor 

(MKS  Type  690).  The  humidity  and  pressure  were  recorded  at  10s  intervals  via  a 

RS232  interface.  The  temperatures  of  gas  samples  contained  in  the  LPAC  were 

measured using 15 platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) in direct thermal contact 

with the  gases, and logged using  a National  Instruments  data logger  NI-4351 at 10s 

intervals.   

Due  to  the  weak  absorption  expected  a  large  number  of  spectra  were  required,  both 

with  the  natural  background  ionisation  and  the  enhancement  provided  by  corona. 

Averages could then be computed to exclude the effects of natural variability in, for 

 

 

 

14 

example,  trace  gases  affecting  ion  composition.  To  minimise  the  effects  of  any 

thermal or temporal drift in the spectrometer, spectra  were recorded  alternately  with 

the  corona  on  or  off,  allowing  30  minutes  between  spectra  for  the  ion  count  to 

stabilise.  To  increase  the  amount  of  data  available,  spectra  were  also  recorded 

overnight, with the corona source switched on and switched off on alternate evenings. 

In  order  to  eliminate  contamination  by  species  created  by  the  positive  corona 

discharge  the  spectra  were  compared  to  simulated  spectra  for  ozone  and  oxides  of 

nitrogen created using the Hitran database (Rothman et al, 2003). No absorption lines 

of any contaminant were seen. A typical raw spectrum, showing absorption from the 

residual carbon dioxide, can be seen in Figure 4. The ratio of all the spectra measured 

with  enhanced  ion  concentrations,  compared  to  spectra  measured  under  ambient  ion 

concentrations  showed  two  absorption  bands  at  12.3  and  9.1µm  (810  and  1095  

cm-1).  These  bands  are  in  similar  locations  to  ionic  absorption  bands  identified  by 

Carlon  (1982)  at  11.8  and  9.3  µm  (847  and  1075  cm-1),  but  further  analysis  was 

necessary to confirm the magnitude of any ionic absorption. The dominant absorption 

signals from residual gases such as CO2 prevented unambiguous identification of any 

other absorption bands. 

3.4 Analysis of spectroscopic data 

To detect continuum absorption due to charged clusters in a spectral region dominated 

by neutral water absorption lines, it was decided to fit the known neutral water vapour 

absorption lines and ratio the spectra to obtain just the continuum spectrum. A similar 

approach  was  used  to  compensate  for  the  absorption  by  residual  carbon  dioxide.  A 

15 

 

 

 

 

sinusoidal  absorption  feature  known  as  channelling,  caused  by  interference  between 

IR radiation being multiply reflected inside one of the optical windows, was evident 

in  the  data  (see  the  vertical  lines  in  Figure  5)  and  was  removed  by  preprocessing. 

Simulated transmission spectra of water and carbon dioxide were generated using the 

Reference  Forward  Model  (Dudhia,  1997)  with  Hitran-2000  data  (Rothman  et  al, 

2003).  A polynomial fit to the background was used to create a simulated absorption 

spectrum  in  the  10.20-11.05  µm  (905-980  cm-1)  region  to  allow  the  water  vapour 

concentration to be fitted to minimise the residual in this region. The carbon dioxide 

was  fitted  in  a  similar  way  between  13.04-13.07  µm  (756-767  cm-1).  Using  these 

fitted  concentrations  of  water  vapour  and carbon dioxide a  final simulated spectrum 

was generated and used to ratio the measured spectra and produce an absorption line 

free  spectrum.  Data  were  excluded  where  strong  absorption  lines  reduced  the 

transmission to below 25% to avoid areas of saturated absorption in the detector. As 

this  removed  sharp  features  in  the  spectrum,  the  resolution  was  reduced  to  increase 

the  signal  to  noise  ratio.  The  spectra  for  both  background  and  enhanced  ionisation 

were  averaged  and  smoothed  using  a  9-point  Savitzky-Golay  filter.  The  enhanced 

spectrum  was  ratioed  by  the  background  to  remove  the  spectral  response  of  the 

spectrometer  and  is  shown  in  Figure  6.  Two  regions  of  enhanced  absorption  can  be 

seen: from 9.5 to 8.8 µm (1050 cm-1 to 1140 cm-1) there is a fractional change in the 

absorption of ~0.03 ± 0.015 and a weaker absorption of ~0.015 ± 0.008 at 12.5 to 12.1 

µm  (800  cm-1  to  825  cm-1).  The  fractional  error  in  these  absorption  signals  is 

conservatively  estimated  based  on  the  variability  in  the  corona  ion  measurements, 

discussed in section 3.2.

4. Conclusions 

Figure  6  shows  two  IR  absorption  bands  measured  in  the  presence  of  cluster-ion 

column concentrations of ~1013 m-2. The location of these bands is very close to two 

of  the  bands  detected  by  Carlon  (1982)  in  a  similar  experiment,  with  ion  column 

concentrations of 1011-1014 m-2. It appears likely that the two regions identified at 12.3 

and  9.1µm  are  related  to  the  presence  of  artificially  generated  positive  molecular-

cluster  ions  causing  a  fractional  change  in  the  IR  transmissivity  in  the  spectroscopy 

cell.  As  was  discussed  in  section  2.2,  typical  columnar  concentrations  of  positive 

atmospheric ions ~1014 m-2. Although atmospheric conditions clearly differ from the 

LPAC  with  substantial  pressure  and  temperature  variations  over  a  50km  vertical 

atmospheric  column,  a  similar  order  of  magnitude  of  absorption  could  be  expected 

from  typical  atmospheric  ion  concentrations.  This  may  be  detectable  in  the 

atmospheric  downwelling  longwave  radiation  at  12.3  and  9.1µm  under  cloud-free 

conditions.  Further  work  is  required  to  quantify  the  sensitivity  of  the  absorption  to 

variations in the ion concentration, and the effect of changing the neutral water vapour 

concentration.

It has recently been argued that quantization can be established within classical theory as 
a  consequence  of  lost  information.    In  this  view,  classical  mechanics  is  regarded  as  a 
union  of  quantum  mechanics  and  what  are  called  (cid:145)hidden  variables(cid:146).  Hidden  variable 
theories  were  first  considered  some  years  ago  and  abandoned,  because  they  did  not 
produce  new  physics.  They  have  now  been  revived  however,  because  they  appear  to 
provide a logically sound means of relating classical and quantum theories.  It is argued 
here that the Heisenberg uncertainty relations constitute a necessary condition for gauge 
invariance  in  the  5-dimensional  Kaluza-Klein  theory,  where  the  fifth  dimension  of  a  5-
spacetime  is  hidden  as  a  5-dimensional  theory  of  general  relativity  is  projected  onto  4-
spacetime.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

1.  Introduction 
 
Quantum mechanics has superceded all classical theories other than the general theory of 
relativity (GTR), and indeed, it has traditionally been expected that GTR will ultimately 
be regarded  as an approximation of a quantum theory of gravity.  Einstein rejected this 
view  however,  and  argued  that  quantum  mechanics  would  ultimately  give  way  to 
classical  physics.    It  was  traditionally  a  (cid:145)hard  call(cid:146),  because  both  GTR  and  quantum 
mechanics  are  incomplete.    While  GTR  cannot  account  for  stellar  collapse  beyond  the 
singularities  that  characterize  the  theory,  quantum  mechanics  cannot  account  for 
individual  events.  But  classical  theory  contains  more  information  than  quantum  theory, 
and in this context, it was argued that a classical theory can become a quantum theory if 
the former, for some reason, loses information.  In this view, classical theory is regarded 
as a union of quantum mechanics and certain (cid:145)hidden variables(cid:146).  The approach involving 
hidden variables was considered by Einstein, but ultimately discarded by him, and by the 
physics community,  because  hidden variable theories produced no new physical results. 
Because the hidden variable approach appears to be logically sound however, it has been 
revived.    One  such  theory  was  proposed  by  this  author.    It  was  demonstrated  that  the 
Bohr  radii  constitute  a  necessary  condition  for  gauge  invariance  in  the  5-dimensional 
Kaluza-Klein  theory.    Specifically,  it  was  demonstrated  that  if  GTR  on  5-spacetime  is 
projected onto 4-spacetime, then the Bohr radii constitute a necessary condition for U(1) 
invariance  [J.  Towe.  1988].    A  second  such  theory  was  proposed  by  B.  Muller,  who 
demonstrated  that  a  classical  system  in  five  dimensions  becomes  a  quantum  system  if 
observed  in  four  dimensions  [B.  Muller,  2001].    A  complementary  result  is  due  to  R. 
Bousso,  who  derived  the  Heisenberg  relation  from  the  holographic  limit  [R.  Bousso, 
2004].  Complimenting these results, G.  (cid:145)t Hooft contributed an  argument that classical 
theories may lose information due to dissipative forces [G. (cid:145)t Hooft, 1999].   
     A theory that was similar to the above described efforts was proposed in the context of 
Hermann  Weyl(cid:146)s  theory  of  gravitation  and  classical  electrodynamics  [H.  Weyl,  1918].  
The  latter theory  postulated  a  generalization  of  Riemannian  geometry  in  which  vectors 
can undergo increments both of orientation and scale when parallel transported around a 
closed  curve.  The  degrees  of  freedom  that  result  from  this  hypothesis  are  precisely 
sufficient  to  produce  Einstein(cid:146)s  gravitation  in  the  astrophysical  domain  of  4-spacetime 
and classical electrodynamics  in the  macroscopic domain.  The discovery that the Weyl 
theory  also  requires  quantization  conditions  occurred  when  Einstein  critiqued  Weyl(cid:146)s 
theory,  observing  that  the  orbital  motions  of  electrons  would,  in  this  theory,  associate 
with increments of proper time scale that would contradict observation [H. Weyl, 1922].  
This  claim  motivated  F.  London  to  demonstrate that  the  Klein-Gordon  equation  can  be 
derived, in the context of the Weyl theory, as a necessary condition for the preservation 
of  proper  time  under  Weyl  scale  transformations  [F.  London,  1927].    Although  these 
results  are  interesting,  the  theories  of  Weyl  and  London  were  not  extensively  studied, 
because they produced no new physical results.   
     The  theory  that  is  introduced  here  parallels  the  theory  of  London,  and  constitutes  a 
generalization  of  the  theory  which  was  introduced  by  this  author  in  1988.    The  fifth 
spacetime  dimension  is  again  regarded  as  a  hidden  variable  and  discarded;  i.e.  general 
relativity  in  five  dimensions  is  again  projected  onto  4-spacetime.  The  relevance  of  the 

proposed  generalization  of  the  1988  theory  is  that  it  derives  general  quantization  (the 
Heisenberg relations) as a necessary condition for gauge invariance. The proposed theory 
also parallels the theory of Muller in that it produces a quantum mechanical version of a 
classical  system  by  hiding  a  fifth  spacetime  dimension,  and  complements  the  theory  of 
Bousso in that it establishes the very general Heisenberg relation.  The proposed theory  
should  also  be  compared  with  the  thinking  of  van  de  Bruck,  who  speculated  that  the 
dissipative  forces,  discussed  by  (cid:145)t  Hooft,  may  be  related  to  gravity  [C.  van  de  Bruck 
2000].  But the approach proposed here is strictly in the tradition of Einstein, because it is 
exclusively  differential  geometric  in  character,  and  derives  general  quantization 
conditions  from  the  5-dimensional  theory  of  general  relativity.    Finally,  it  should  be 
observed that the theory proposed here appears to be complemented by recent discussions 
regarding an ultimate superunification.  Specifically, the proposed theory models, from a 
strictly  differential  geometric  perspective,  the  (quantum  electrodynamical)  stationary 
states of Dirac and Klein-Gordon particles; e.g. of electrons.  Based upon recent results, it 
appears that supergravity in the context of superstring compactification, can be regarded 
as modeling (supergravitational) stationary states of the baryon [J. Towe, 2005].

which Kaluza and Klein interpreted as constituting the electromagnetic field tensor on  4-
spacetime. Let us now consider the energy of this electromagnetic field in the presence of 
4-current. If the Lagrangian, L , is described in terms of  Fµ
ν, if L is invariant under the 
group U(1) of 1-parameter phase transformations, and if the variational principle  
 
                                                                 δ∫ L d4x = 0, 
 
is restricted to a variation of action with respect to the metrical coefficients gµ5, then the 
(that  describe  classical 
Euler-Lagrange  equations  are 
electromagnetic  interactions  in  4-spacetime).    If  these  are  integrated,  the  result  is  a 
classical  electromagnetic  wave  in  4-spacetime.    But  this  electromagnetic  wave  is 
distinguished from the ordinary electromagnetic wave.  This wave, due to its origin in the 
Kaluza-Klein theory, is characterized by special invariance properties.  Specifically, this 
wave  is  invariant  under  phase  transformations  that  constitute  a  group,  which  can  be 
parameterized in terms of either electrical charge or 4-momentum.       
     The group U(1) consists (to first order in the parameter u = uµdx
phase transformations

U(1)  is  usually  parameterized  in  terms  of  electrical  charge,  so  that  invariance  of  an 
interaction  under  U(1)  is,  by  Noether(cid:146)s  theorem,  equivalent  to  conservation  by  that 
interaction  of  electrical  charge. 
this 
parameterization  in terms of  electrical charge  is equivalent to parameterization  in terms 
of  4-momentum.  To  demonstrate this,  let  us  consider  the  tensorial  equations  describing 
the acceleration of an electrical charge in an electromagnetic field:

one observes that electrical charge, e, constitutes the 5th component of 5-momentum that 
is, in the context of the Kaluza-Klein theory, represented by the charge of a test particle 
in an electromagnetic field.  In the Kaluza-Klein context then, 5-action is given by

  on  4-spacetime.    In  the  4-spacetime 
projection  of  5-dimensional  GTR,  which  is  required  by  the  Kaluza-Klein  theory  then, 
parameterization of the group U(1) of phase transformations in terms of electrical charge 
edx5 is equivalent to parameterization in terms of 4-momentum Pµdx
     In this context, consider a classical wave propagating in 4-spacetime; and consider the

Since  division  by  zero  is  mathematically  precluded,  and  since  negative  action  is  not 
contemplated, it must be concluded that k>0 (as stipulated above), so that   
 
                                                                 Pµdx

Moreover, if axes are aligned so that motion is parallel to the µ-axis, one can write  
 
                                                                  Pµdx
   
where summation is not implied.  Thus, since every axis can be aligned with motion, one 
can write                                                  
 
                                                      Pµdx
  
 
 
Finally, since k has the dimensions of action, one can assign to k a constant value: 
 

µ  ≥  2πk: µ = 1, 2, 3, 4.                                       (12) 

                                                                     k =

so that (11) reduces to

     The  notion  that  quantum  mechanics  can  emerge  from  classical  theory;  e.g.  from 
general  relativity  is  often  described  as  infeasible  due  to  the  counterintuitive  nature  of 
quantum  theory.  Even  though  quantum  physics  contains  less  information  than  classical 
physics, it is argued that the many strange and counterintuitive concepts that are involved 
in  the  former  can  hardly  be  accounted  for  in  terms  of  classical  physics.    It  should  be 
recognized  however, that one  is  not obligated to account, one  by one,  for the details of 
quantum  theory.    All  of  quantum  mechanics  (up  to  relativistic  considerations)  can  be 
derived  from  the  Heisenberg  uncertainty  principle,  or  from  the  logically  equivalent 
Schrodinger  formulation.    The  essential  element  is  simply  the  non-zero  value  of  the 
quantum of action.

Forces arising from overlap between the guided waves of parallel, microphotonic 

waveguides are calculated. Both attractive and repulsive forces, determined by the 

choice of relative input phase, are found. Using realistic parameters for a silicon-

on-insulator material system, we estimate that the forces are large enough to cause 

observable displacements. Our results illustrate the potential for a broader class of 

optically-tunable microphotonic devices and microstructured artificial materials.

Electronic bonding, resulting from overlap between electron wavefunctions, is a ubiquitous 

phenomenon that gives rise to material structure. It is intriguing to consider an analogous 

phenomenon of “optical bonding,” where overlapping modes of linear optical waveguides result 

in the attractive or repulsive force between the waveguides.  

 

It is known that intense, “external” laser illumination can create forces between dielectric 

or metallic spheres, due to interactions between the spheres’ induced dipole moments (1-5). The 

nature of the force (attractive or repulsive) depends on the relative phase of the dipole moments 

(3, 6, 7). Our work identifies forces arising from “internal” illumination by light traveling in 

coupled waveguides. Unlike in previous work, we show that the sign of the force can be changed 

from attractive to repulsive at fixed frequency simply by tuning the relative phase of the system’s 

inputs. Already, research has shown that evanescent fields can be used to trap (8), manipulate 

(9), and propel (10) nanoparticles. Our work extends the study of optical forces to interacting, 

evanescent waveguide modes, suggesting that coupling forces could provide a mechanism for 

optical positioning and control within integrated optical devices.  

We consider two parallel, silicon strip waveguides (refractive index  n = 3.45) separated 

by a distance d, as shown in Figure 1(a). Each waveguide has a square cross section of 

dimensions a × a. We will characterize the modes of the two-waveguide system as even or odd 

with respect to the mirror planes at y=0 and z=0, according to the symmetry of the vector field. 

Vector symmetry implies that individual electric field components parallel to a mirror plane are 

symmetric (anti-symmetric), and components perpendicular to a mirror plane are anti-symmetric 

(symmetric) in the case of even (odd) modes (11).  

The dispersion relation for y-odd modes (odd with respect to y=0 plane) of the two-

waveguide system is shown in Figure 1(b). Modes lying outside the light cone (shaded yellow)

are guided. For infinite separation of the waveguides  (d /a = ∞), no coupling occurs. Modes of 

the two, isolated waveguides are degenerate, and the dispersion relation is that of a single strip 

waveguide, shown as a solid, black line. As the waveguides come closer, the degeneracy is 

broken and two distinct eigenmodes appear. Data for a separation of d /a = 1.0 are shown by a 

dashed red line, and data for  d /a = 0.1 are shown by a dotted blue line. Modes tending to lie 

above the isolated waveguide mode have z-odd symmetry (Ey is anti-symmetric with respect to 

z=0) and modes lying below the isolated waveguide mode have z-even symmetry (Ey is 

symmetric).

on either waveguide (12). Negative values here correspond to attractive forces. We used Eq. 1 to 

calculate the optically-induced force for a dimensionless frequency of νa /c = a /λ= 0.2. Results 

are shown as symbols in Figure 1(c). The force was also calculated using the Maxwell stress 

tensor (13, 6), using the full numerical eigenmode solution of the two-waveguide system (14), 

and is shown by solid lines. Excellent agreement was obtained.  The dimensionless force per unit 

length  (F /L)(ac /P)  is plotted as a function of dimensionless waveguide separation  d /a on the 

left and bottom axes; c is the speed of light in vacuum and  P = v gU /L is the total power 

transmitted through the coupled waveguides ( gv  is the group velocity). Numerical values of 

force per unit length can be obtained by substituting typical  experimental parameter values. For

νa /c = 0.2, operation at  λ= 1.55μ m requires that  a = 310nm. The right and top axes show the 

dependence of the force per unit length on separation for an input power  P = 100mW . 

 

For separations  d /a greater than about 0.3, the anti-symmetric mode gives a repulsive 

force, while the symmetric mode gives an attractive force. The force decays exponentially with 

increasing separation, as expected from a tight-binding picture (15, 16): the two waveguides 

couple through the overlap of their evanescent modal tails. Intuitively, the lower-frequency, 

symmetric mode is attractive since its frequency decreases as the waveguides come together. 

Using the Maxwell stress tensor formalism, it is easy to show that modal contributions add 

incoherently to the spatially-averaged force. The force can thus be tuned from attractive to 

repulsive at fixed frequency by controlling the relative phase of the waveguide inputs. 

 

For smaller separations, the tight-binding picture is no longer accurate. For the anti-

symmetric mode, the force is nonmonotonic: repulsive for large separations and attractive for 

small separations. The zero-separation limit values were calculated to be -1.49 for the symmetric 

(y-odd, z-even) mode and -21.54 for the antisymmetric (y-odd, z-odd) mode. The strong 

attractive force associated with the antisymmetric mode is due to the enhancement of  E z  inside 

(cid:2) 
the slit due to the boundary conditions at the interface.   
E -field enhancement was previously 

discussed in (17) for modes with y-even symmetry. For larger separations, we found that the y-

even, z-odd mode is attractive and the y-even, z-even mode is weakly repulsive. In the zero-

separation limit, the y-even, z-odd mode is strongly attractive due to field enhancement: 

(F /L)(ac /P) =-19.55. The y-even, z-even mode is weakly attractive: (F /L)(ac /P) =-0.21. 

We next estimate the deflection (w) that a waveguide experiences due to an attractive, 

optically-induced force (y-odd, z-even mode). Figure 2(a) shows a potential implementation of 

our two-waveguide system in silicon on insulator material. Two Si waveguides, each of cross-

sectional dimensions 

ha × , rest on a SiO2 substrate with a free-standing section of length L. 

Each waveguide can be described as a double-clamped beam loaded with force per unit length q 

(18) that can be approximated with a linear function for small separations (Figure 1(c)):

where I=ha3/12 is the moment of inertia of the waveguide and E=169GPa is the Young modulus 

of Si. We assume that the change in phase velocity with distance along the bent waveguide is 

adiabatic and causes no reflection, valid assumptions for (L>>wmax ). Reflection from the ends of 

the suspended section is also neglected. In Figure 2(b) we plot the displacement as a function of 

position along the waveguides for P=100mW (λ=1.55μ m). Displacement of wmax≈20nm is 

obtained at the center of suspended section of each waveguide when L=30μ m , h=a=310nm and 

d=46.5nm. Figure 2(c) shows the dependence of wmax on L and P; longer suspended regions 

deflect more for the same input power. The required power can be significantly reduced by 

reducing the waveguide core size (e.g. P=50mW when h=a=264nm) as well as making tall and 

narrow waveguides (h>a). This increases the fraction of energy in the air region between the 

waveguides, increasing the strength of the interaction, and also decreases the moment of inertia. 

The opto-mechanical response can also be improved by exploiting the mechanical resonance (19) 

of the suspended beams. Exciting the structure with a laser beam pulsed at the resonant 

frequency (MHz range) will significantly increase the beam deflection for a given input power.  

 

An intriguing possibility for further increasing the magnitude of the force is slow-light 

enhancement, since the force increases as 1/vg  for fixed input power (20). We note that the 

electrostatic force due to trapped or induced charges in Si waveguides is estimated to be at least 

an order of magnitude smaller than the optically-induced force. The Casimir-Lifshitz force is 

even smaller. Optical evanescent-wave bonding forces are not restricted to the specific geometry

and material system studied above. We have calculated that significant forces also arise, for 

example, between coupled silica microspheres (12). More generally, the use of optical, guided-

wave signals to reposition the constituent parts of microphotonic devices suggests a new class of 

artificial, microstructured materials in which the internal mechanical configuration and resultant 

optical properties are coupled to incoming light signals.

Abstract

In the framework of density functional theory a new formulation of electronegativity that recovers the

Mulliken definition is proposed and its reliability is checked by computing electronegativity values for

a large number of elements. It is found that the obtained values, which are compared with previously

proposed electronegativity scales, fulfill the main periodic criteria.

Introduction

properties [1].

In modern chemistry, the concept of electronegativity (χ), firstly proposed by J. J. Berzelius in 1811,

plays a crucial role because it can be considered as one of the most important chemical descriptors in

order to account for the tendency of the atoms to build up a molecular system.

About 70 years ago, Pauling by an ingenious mixing of thermodynamical and quantum mechanical

arguments  introduced  an  electronegativity  scale,  which  has  enriched  the  concept  of  atomic  periodic

A  step  forward  was  took  in  1934  and  1935  [2]    by  Mulliken,  which  introduced  a  different

formulation in terms of two other periodic properties, namely the ionization potential and the electron

affinity, and enabled the extension of this concept to molecules.

In the history of electronegativity formulations has to be remarked the classical Allred-Rochow scale

that introduces the idea of force into the electronegativity theory [3].

The  electronegativity  definition  was  subsequently  modified  and  enriched  toward  a  gradual

appreciation of the various complexities involved in the concept [4-21].

In a continuous effort to better define the rather intuitive concept of electronegativity, the Parr idea

to  define  χ  as  the  negative  of  the  chemical  potential  of  the  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  of

Hohenberg  and  Kohn,  i.e.  as  the  first  derivative  of  the  energy  functional,  the  connection  between

electronegativity  and  quantum  mechanics  has  been  established  [21,  22].  This  result  has  opened  up

exciting  perspectives  to  calculate  χ  for  whatever  many  electron  systems  such  as  atoms,  molecules,

clusters.  Moreover,  in  order  to  measure  the  “power  of  atoms  to  attract  electrons  to  themselves”  [1],

using the arsenal of different formulation, working formulas and modern quantum mechanical methods,

a series of electronegativity scales has been proposed [23].

In this work, a new electronegativity formulation is proposed within the density functional theory,

which  appears  to  be  the  natural  and  convenient  tool  to  investigate  this  quantity.  In  the  same  context

some  attention  is  given  to  the  analysis  of  the  equivalence  between  the  Mulliken  and  the  differential

definitions  of  χ.  The  calculated  electronegativities  for  52  atoms  are  organized  in  an  electronegativity

scale that is compared with those previously proposed [24-26] using several definitions. Furthermore,

the orbital electronegativities for C, N, and O atoms are also given.

Theoretical Method

Density Functional reactivity indices background

Among the chemical concepts that have found a rigorous quantitative definition in the framework of

the DFT a special attention was given to the electronegativity formulation [27, 28].  

For an N-electronic system placed into an external potential 

)(rV

 the general (first order) equation

of the change in the chemical potential, 

rVNµ=µ
[
(

,

)]

, can be written as [21]:

in  which  the  variation  of  the  chemical  potential  µ   (or  the  electronegativity  in  the  Parr  definition

χ−=µ

)  for  an  electronic  system  is  correlated  with  variation  of  the  number  of  electrons  and  of  the

external potential through the chemical hardness ( η):

                                                         (2)

and the Fukui function (f):

Thus, the chemical potential (or the electronegativity) concept appears to be strictly connected

with  the  other  two,  chemical  hardness  and  Fukui  function,  extensively  used  reactivity  criteria.  It  is

noteworthy  that  although  in  the  original  hardness  definition  the  factor  ½  was  put  in  to  make  it

symmetrical  with  respect  to  the  chemical  potential  definition  [29],  nowadays  the  convention  without

Using  the  Parr  definition  of  electronegativity  for  the  chemical  potential,  from  equation  5  this

chemical descriptor takes the form:

Furthermore,  using  the  same  equation  5  incorporated  in  the  hardness  definition,  equation  2,  the

expression for the hardness, as the second order derivative of the total energy with respect to the total

number of electrons, assumes the form:

Turning  now  to  the  Maxwell  identity,  equation  7,  the  Fukui  index  given  by  equation  3  can  be

defined in terms of the density and the number of electrons as:

electronegativity is obtained:

it is easily recognized that equation 11 has the same form as equations 1 and 4.

However, in order to find the electronegativity we propose the alternative integration of equation 1

in the following way.

First, let us express the hardness and Fukui function through the relations [21]:

where S and s(r) represent the global and the local softness defined as:

All  these  chemical  descriptors  depend  on  the  electronic  density  and  will  be  usefully  combined  in

order to derive the desired Mulliken electronegativity.

The Absolute Electronegativity Formula

Introducing  the  expressions  21  and  22  into  the  hardness  and  Fukui  functions  definitions  (see

equations 13 and 14) we can integrate the equation 1 for the electronegativity, assuming the initial zero

electronegativity value as V(x)→0, to obtain:

The Mulliken  Electronegativity from DFT Principles

Starting from the proposed electronegativity expression (eq. 27), the identification of the Mulliken

and  the  Parr  differential  electronegativity  definitions  is  demonstrated,  without  to  have  recourse  the

application  of  the  finite  difference  scheme  to  equation  8.  Moreover,  a  reformulation  of  the  Mulliken

electronegativity definition is obtained as a generalization of the classical one when the DFT concepts

are included.

Starting from the traditional Mulliken electronegativity formula, in terms of ionization potential (IP)

and electron affinity (EA) [2], the following series of identities can be considered:

As a consequence of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, each of the last two terms of the right side of

equation  34  vanish.  This  can  be  accomplished  in  the  virtue  of  the  equivalence  31,  that  permits  to

rewrite the variational equation for the ground-state density functional theory:

                                                             {

It  is  worth  to  note  that  the  last  expression  combines  the  first  and  second  Hohenberg-Kohn  theorems,

providing  the  context  in  which  the  last  two  terms  of  eq.  34  become  zero.    Thus,  the  Mulliken

electronegativity within DFT is obtained:

As  eq.  37  clearly  shows,  the  relationship  between  the  Mulliken  electronegativity  and  the  Parr

differential one does not involve the use of the finite difference approximation and does not depend on

the particular form of E(N).

Taking into account equation 8, the  identity in eq. 37, becomes:

The  result  38,  which  is  here  rigorously  density  functional  principles  based,  was  also  previously

By performing the definite integration required in the equation 38, using equation 27, we arrive to

the present density functional Mulliken version of electronegativity:

Although we have started from a formulation in terms of ionization and affinity terms we have

derived  a  reformulation  depending  on  different  quantities,  such  as  total  number  of  electrons,  density,

external  potential  and  their  gradients.  This  new  approach  allows  to  extend  the  description  of  various

chemical situations as atoms involved in bonds.

Equations 27 and 39 are consistent with the electronegativity equalization principle as shown in

the  Appendix.    The  electronegativity  expression  given  in  the  equation  39  represents  our  proposed

working  electronegativity  formula  that  will  be  used  in  order  to  derive  an  electronegativity  scale  for

almost the entire periodic table.

In this section we list the steps that have to take into account in order to apply the proposed Mulliken

The electrons of the atomic system are distinguished as core and valence ones.

The core produces an effective potential in which the valence electrons are moving.

The  effective  potential  of  the  core  is  represented  as  a  pseudo-potential.  In  this  work,  the

Stuttgart/Bonn group pseudo-potentials have been employed, starting from lithium [34].

The valence electrons are represented by the pseudo-potential wave-function  [34,] which is forced

normalize to one, to simplify the computations. To fulfill the normalization condition:

a sort of  ”scaling factor” (q) has to be involved in the wave function  expansion:

and the Mulliken electronegativity (39) is computed.

Since the condition of eq. 40 is very restrictive, the scaling factor, q, has been fixed also considering

an  additional  constrain  that  takes  into  consideration  the  number  of  valence  electrons.  This  aim  was

accomplished noting that previous atomic electronegativity formulations fit our definition of chemical

action, CA, through the use of a Coulombic potential [35]:

Results and Discussion

Before to discuss the reliability of our results, we would like to underline that the main goal of our

work  resides  in  the  demonstration  that  the  Mulliken  electronegativity  can  be  rigorously  expressed

within the density functional theory and, consequently, we do not propose a new scale that aspires to

replace the previous electronegativity scales. However,  we emphasize that although the  starting point

In any case the obtained results for 52 elements from Lithium through Xenon seem to satisfy most of

the criteria for the acceptability of an electronegativity scale.

Results coming from the application of equation 39 are listed in Table 1 together with some previous

electronegativity scales.

In particular, we have reported the Mulliken electronegativity, named experimental, obtained using

experimental values of ionisation potentials and electron affinities [25, 37].

11

Amongst the theoretical approaches, we have chosen to report the Mulliken-Jaffé scale [24, 36] and

the electronegativity values, calculated by a simple Xα method employing the transition-state approach

[26], that we have called Xα scale.

Concerning the acceptability guidelines our results can be summarized as follows [38]:

(i) 

the scale was built up for isolated atoms;

(ii) 

two  significant  figures  are  able  to  distinguish  the  electronegativities  of  all  the  considered

elements;

(iii) 

the given values are expressed in electronvolts;

(iv) 

all the valence electrons were included in the electronegativity computation;

(v) 

values obtained for the elements (N, O, F, Ne, Cl, Ar, Br, Kr) that present oxidation states

lower than their valence electrons follow the appropriate requirement with the exception of

the chlorine and fluorine  atoms that have a  χ  values higher than that of the nearest noble gas

atoms,  Ne  and  Ar,  respectively.  The  electronegativity 

trend  for 

these  atoms 

is

F>Cl>Ne>Ar>O>N>Kr>Br. We consider that the use of functions of spherical symmetry can

be  indicated  as  the  main  source  of  error  in  the  chlorine  and  fluorine  electronegativity

determinations;

(vi) 

the six considered metalloid elements (B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te) that separate the metals from

the  non-metals  have  electronegativity  values,  which  do  not  allow  overlaps  between  metals

and non-metals. Furthermore, looking at the  χ  metal values the requirement that they have

to  have  electronegativities  lower  than  that  found  for  the  silicon,  the  so-called  silicon  rule

[38], is satisfied although silicon does not show the lowest  χ   value in the metalloid band.

On the other hand this result well agrees with the experimental [37] and previous theoretical

[26]  determination  performed  at  Xα  level  of  theory.  Finally  we  note  that  this  behavior

respects the fundamental rule of the decreasing of electronegativity down groups;

(vii) 

for  binary  compounds  the  difference  in  electronegativity  satisfies  the  definition  of  ionic,

covalent and metallic bonds as required by the Ketelaar’s triangle;

12

(viii)  our definition is fully quantum mechanical;

(ix) 

the decreasing of  χ  along the group is respected as well as its difference in going from light

to heavy atoms of the same period increases left to right across rows taking into account that

for  some  heavy  elements  the  relativistic  effects,  which  are  not  considered  in  the

computations,  can  affect  this  trend.  Correctly,  the  halogen  atoms  have  the  highest

electronegativity  values  with  respect  to  their  left  row  neighbors.  Looking  to  the  transition

metal  atoms,  we  underline  that  the  obtained  electronegativities  fall  in  a  narrow  range  of

values compared with those of the main group atoms.

In order to verify the adopted symmetry influence, we have recalculated the electronegativity  for C,

O and N atoms by using p-type orbitals and the sp, sp2 and sp3 hybridization states.

Results, reported in Figure 1, show how the introduction of more realistic basis sets for the valence

orbital description increases the agreement amongst electronegativity trends.

Indeed,  the computed χ  values follow the trends previously obtained by Mulliken – Jaffè by using s-

and p- orbital basis and the same hybridized states.

Finally,  it  should  be  remarked  analysing  Fig.1,  that  the  electronegativity  trend  from  a  type  of

hybridization to another is similar.

sensitive to the hybrid orbitals as well.

and of other periodic properties [40].

This indicates that the actual electronegativity formulation preserves also the orbital hierarchy and is

Moreover, the usefulness of this approach can be tested performing calculation of reactivity indices

Conclusions

In  the  framework  of  density  functional  theory,  we  propose  a  new  electronegativity  formulation

which  is  used  to  compute  a  scale  for  almost  the  entire  periodic  table.  Furthermore,  we  show  an

analytical way for the determination of the density functional Mulliken electronegativity  that properly

links the electronic local quantities, such as the density and the potential, with the global ones, as the

number of electrons neither involving the direct energy computation nor assuming a particular behavior

for energy, E(N).

The  proposed  electronegativity  values  follow  almost  all  the  general  criteria  of  acceptability  of  the

proposed  χ  scales, although the data are basis-set dependent on the way in which the valence orbital

electrons  are  described.  The  present  approach  opens  also  other  perspectives.  For  instance,  the  actual

study  can  be  extended  also  to  the  molecular  systems  by  the  appropriate  implementation  of  the

molecular density and the (effective) potential.

Appendix

The  electronegativity  of  an  atom  in  a  molecule  ( χ )  can  be  evaluated  starting  from  the  atomic

electronegativity (χ0) and hardness (η0) through the relations [18a-c, 20]:

being γ a fall-off parameter [18b].

The  reliability  of  the  proposed  electronegativity  expressions,  eqs.  27  and  39,  can  be  checked

showing that they are consistent with A.1 equations.

To do this, one can consider the atom placed at the center of a sphere of infinite radius in which has

to be evaluated the influence of the electronegativity of the same atom, up to where the probability to

find  electrons  is  very  low.  Therefore,  if  we  apply  the  limit  N(r→∞)→0,  on  the  actual  27  and  39

absolute and Mulliken electronegativity formulations, the following equations are obtained:

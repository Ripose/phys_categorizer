ABSTRACT 
I suggest to consider a proton as a body in a state of free precession. Such approach allows to 
define  a  proton  as  periodic  system  with  two  rotary  degrees  of  freedom  with  corresponding 
frequency ratio and resonances. In result on a power scale the points corresponding to a birth of 
leptons are designated. The interrelation between masses of leptons is established through a fine 
structure constant. The given approach is distributed to a nucleus. Other representation is given 
on the nature of X-rays which connect with a charge of a nucleus and its mass.

This  paper  proposes  a  model  of  the  proton  that  makes  possible  a  new  approach  to 
description  of  elementary  physical  phenomena  and  allows  one  to  calculate  some  fundamental 
constants[1] previously known only from experiment. The proposed hypothesis is based on the a 
priori assumption that the proton can be presented as a gyroscope that has a shape of an ellipsoid 
and undergoes a free precession. Such an approach allows one to describe a proton as the object 
undergoing  simultaneously  two  rotations,  basic  and  precessional,  that  creates  conditions  for 
appearing resonances between these periodic movements. 

1.  The proton as a gyroscope in a state of free precession 

Let us turn to the theory of the gyroscope. This will help us find out why a proton can be 
thought  of  as  a  freely  precessing  gyroscope  and  what  known  physical  phenomena  can  be 
explained in terms of that concept. 

According to the theory of the gyroscope, when a rotor is in a state of steady precession, 
the OZ axis of the rotor, about which the rotor rotates at a constant angular speed φ, precesses at 
a constant angular speed Ω about the OZ1 axis, which makes an angle θ with this OZ axis. The 
components  of  the  external  moment  M  for  this  steady  precession,  if  it  has  occurred,  to  be 
sustained are expressed as

The  steady  precession  can  convert  into  a  free  precession  when  the  external  moment

As long as that condition is fulfilled, the free precession will last indefinitely; at θ close to 900,

At borderline case when angular velocity of precession Ω considerably exceeds angular 
 
velocity  of  the  basic  rotation  φ,  axis  Z  turns  on  a  corner  close  to  900  (the  gyroscope  turns 
sideways, fig. 1b), and as though carries out simultaneously two rotations. Such an extreme case 
is realized, if А/B=2+δ where δ has a very small value.  

Let  us  accept  a  priori  that  the  proton  is  an  ellipsoid  and,  for  any  reason,  is  in  a  free 
precession state. Thus it makes the basic rotation with angular speed φ around the axis ОZ and 
precessional rotation with angular speed Ω around the axis OX, i.e. the extreme case of the free 
precession realizes. Its moments of inertia: В=0.2mpb2 - the moment of inertia of ellipsoid with 
respect to the axis ОZ, А=0.2mpa2 - the moment of inertia of ellipsoid with respect to the axis 
OX, (mp - mass of a proton, b - small half-axle of ellipsoid, a - big half-axle of ellipsoid). At 
А/B=2+δ accordingly a/b =

δ+2

.

We  allow  that  in  the  course  of  its  appearing  in  the  Big  Bang  the  proton  has  come  in  a 
state of the free precession. Thus it has incorporated a maximum of the energy concentrated in its 
precessional  rotation  due  to  what  linear  speed  of  the  ellipsoid’s  top  has  achieved  the  greatest 
possible  speed  –  the  speed  of  light.  How  will  it  react  to  any  external  influence?  It  should  tear 
away the energy brought from the outside. According to the third law of Newton, the gyroscope 
develops equal on value and the opposite moment on a direction, interfering external influence. 
This moment M is called a gyroscopic reactionary torque. But this reaction should be expressed 
in  a  specific  way.  As  the  proton  in  our  representation  is  a  periodic  system  with  two  rotary 
degrees  of  freedom,  the  fault  of  energy  should  be  carried  out  according  to  the  frequency 
correlations  inherent  in  periodic  systems  and  resonances.  In  other  words,  the  excessive  energy 
should  be  removed  by  electromagnetic  quantums  or  irraradiation  of  particles.  The  latter  is  the 
assumption that should be checked-up. 

 

2. Proton and radiations 
 
If our proposed idea takes place indeed, then it is possible to assume that appearance of 

the electron is a result of some external influence on proton being in a free precession state.   

Being guided by only intuitive guess, we take that at the moment of electron appearance 
the  relation  of  angular  velocity  of  precession  to  angular  speed  of  the  basic  rotation  is  equal  to 
Ω/φ = 1836.156, i.e. to the relation of the proton mass to electron mass mp/me. Then according 
to (1.1) А/B=2.0000082 and, accordingly, it is possible to take a/b= 2 .  

As we assumed in Section 1, in the considered extreme case the linear speed of the top of 
light 
the  ellipsoid-proton  making  precessional 
rotation, 
с=2.997924·108m/s,  i.e.  Vpr=Ωa=c.  As  frequencies  of  the  basic  and  precessional  rotations  of 
the gyroscope are interconnected, we can determine the linear speed of the end of small half-axle 
Vmain which with the account a/b= 2  and Ω/φ = 1836.156 is calculated from (2.1):

The value Еmain with accuracy of 2.3 % coincides with Ridberg energy ЕR =13.605667 
eV which is determined by the top border of Layman series (the so-called optical limit) and is 
taken as the energy of ionization of the hydrogen atom. This result is a surprising one since it is 
obtained  on  the  basis  of  only  mechanistic  representation  and  provides  a  way  to  consider  the 
suggested model in more detail. Therefore, we shall continue our estimations. To the explanation 
of the difference between Еmain and ЕR we shall return later.  

 
Interrelationship of fundamental constants in frames of the model

Let us make an arbitrary assumption that νmain=c/Λе (Λе=2.426310·10-12m – Compton 
length  of  electron)  that  gives  value  νmain=1.23559.1020  Hz.  Validity  of  this  assumption  is 
justified by the results obtained below. We transform, accordingly, the formula (2.3) into (2.4):

i.e. the angular momentum of a point with mass mp moving on a circumference of radius a, is 
equal to Planck's constant h divided on 2π (ħ=h/2π).  
Thus,  in  the  framework  of  the  proposed  model  and  accepted  arbitrary  νmain=c/Λе  we 
 
have precisely calculated the sizes of the proton, the Compton length of the proton and Planck's 
constant. Hence, it is possible to approve that the assumption is correct. 

Let  us  comment  the  obtained  result.  The  concept  of  the  Compton  length  of  electron 
Λе=h/mеc  appeared  in  1923  after  the  experiment  performed  by  Compton  on  the  angular 
scattering of X-rays. It has been shown that the spectra of scattered X-rays displace aside longer 
waves  in  comparison  with  the  spectra  of  initial  X-rays,  and  the  value  of  displacement  ∆λ 
depends  only  on  scattering  angle  θ.  The  experimental  data  were  fitted  by  the  formula 

λ∆ =

С

sin

2

, where C was the universal constant having a length dimension and numerically 

equal  to  2

.  At  theoretical  interpretation  of  the  Compton  effect,  the  following  physical 

assumption has been entered: if the X-ray quantum scattered by electron in atom and takes up a

part of energy and a impulse of the falling quantum. The laws of conservation of energy and a 
impulse were applied. The quantum energy was determined as Еγ=hν, the impulse as рγ=hν/c 

(by  A.Einstein).  Thus  the  formula 

λ∆ =

  has  been  obtained.  But  it  is  necessary  to

note that occurrence of universal value Λе=h/mеc in this formula was only formal, following 
mathematical  calculations.  Reflections  of  physicists  about  physical  sense  of  Λе  have  led  to 
representation  about  the  dual  nature  of  radiation  –  wave-corpuscular.  According  to  this 
conception,  the  particle  can  be  presented  as  a  quantum  with  energy  Еγ=hν=mc2  and, 
accordingly,  as  a  wave  with  a  wavelength  Λ=c/ν=h/mc.[4]  The  Compton-effect  has  been 
recognized as the experimental evidence of this dual nature. In our representation the Compton 
length has another physical maintenance. With reference to proton Λp corresponds to frequency 
of free precession. With reference to electron Λе corresponds to frequency of the basic rotation 
of  the  proton  at  the  moment  of  electron  birth.  How  to  interpret  the  Compton  effect  in  this 
representation? The author is at a loss to answer. For this purpose, one should assume that there 
is a certain interaction between the frequency of X-ray radiation and the frequency of the basic 
rotation of the proton. 
 
From  the  previous  consideration  it  is  possible  to  deduce  more  conclusions.  Let  us 
calculate  the  frequency  of  precession  νpr  from  с=Ωа=2πνprа:    νpr=2.26873.1023  Hz.  The 
energy  of  the  quantum  corresponding  to  this  frequency  of  rotation:  Е=hνpr=938.27157  МeV, 
that  coincides  with  the  energy  of  the  proton  rest  mass,  calculated  under  Einstein's  formula 
Е=mрс2. 

Let us see that the energy 

determined under formula Е=mрс2 is the total energy of a

It  is  easy  to  be  convinced  that  with  the  calculated  values  a  and  νpr  product  4π2mpa2νpr=h. 
Introduction of analogy between the precessional rotation of a proton-ellipsoid and the rotation 
of  the  thin  ring,  having  the  same  mass  and  frequency  of  rotation,  has  allowed  us  to  look 
differently at the nature of the energy of rest mass. 
However, there is a question. The energy of any quantum is determined as Еγ=hν, where 
 
ν - the frequency inherent in quantum. At the same time, the earlier calculated value h includes 
as a multiplier frequency νpr, inherent to precessional rotation of the proton. It turns out that Еγ 
is proportional to product νprν. According to the theory of a gyroscope in precession state, this 
should be. The matter is that the reactive moment M with which a gyroscope reacts to external 
influence, is determined as М=Iωprωmain, where I - the moment of inertia, ωpr - angular speed 
of precession, ωmain - angular speed of the basic rotation[3]. According to Euler's equation for a 
rotating body in a state of free precession angular speed ωpr=const[5]  From here it is clear why 
h=const.  Clearly  also,  the  reaction  of  such  a  gyroscope  on  the  external  influence  should  be 
expressed in change of angular speed of the basic rotation and to corresponding dump of energy 
as radiation of particles or γ-quanta. It is shown below how it occurs in reality.

The proposed model allows one to obtain some more interesting results. We shall use an 

Let  us  return  to  the  formula  (2.3)  and  make  one  more  assumption.  We  admit  that  the 
energy of basic rotation Еmain=13.914928 eV calculated by (2.2) is the energy of the quantum 
having a corresponding frequency, according to the formula of Planck Еmain=hν. On the other 
hand, we shall define the same energy as energy of a rotating ring with mass mр and with the 
frequency equal to the frequency of quantum. For a rotating ring kinetic energy is determined as

It is possible to conclude that we deal with the latent parametrical resonance at which the

Hypothetical particles 
It  is  necessary  to  elucidate  one  interesting  question:  what  mean  Rydberg  energy ЕR  in 
our consideration? In Bohr`s model of hydrogen atom ЕR is electron kinetic energy in 1-st orbit 
and  is  accepted  as  upper  limit  of  an  optical  spectrum.  Under  formula  ЕR=hν  the  value 
ν=3.28987·1015  Hz  coincide  fine  with  upper  limit  of  short-wave  Layman  series.  This  fact  has 
defined success of the planetary model. In our model energy Еmain=14.098727 eV is close to ЕR 
(a difference ~0,5 eV). But we shall show that ЕR has other physical contents.

frequency 
that  arbitrary  choice  of 
νmain=c/Λе=1,23·1020 Hz appeared to be proved due to the fact of coincidence of values br and 
Λе  (a  condition  of  resonance).  It  has  allowed  one  to  calculate  values  of  some  fundamental 
constants  correctly.  But  this  value  νmain  corresponds  to  the  upper  limit  of  X-ray  range  on  a 
power  scale.  In  the  logic  of  our  consideration  it  turns  out  that  the  electron  birth  occurs  at  this 
frequency.  Then  due  to  the  same  logic,  we  should  assume  that  at  frequency ν=3.2880,1015  Hz 
calculated under formula ЕR=hν there is a birth of particle X with mass mxc2=ER =13,605 eV.

But there is a question: what does the particle with mass mxc2=ER =13,605 eV mean? If 
it  really  exists,  we  should  assume  that  it  have  an  electric  charge.  It  is  possible  to  explain 
occurrence  of  charges  at  triboelectrification  or  in  the  piezoelectric  phenomena  because  the 
energy necessary for such excitation is small enough (Vmain≈3m/s) Secondly, its mass is close to 
the expected neutrino mass, and on this basis it is possible to name this particle "electrino". The 
following question: how to compare it to the available representations about hydrogen atom? We 
shall try to answer this question below. 

The resonant approach suggested here allows one to solve another problem: the problem 

of definition of the muon mass. It is clear that the ratio

The  calculated  value  mxc2  differs  from  the  experimental  value  of  muon  mass  mµc2= 

105.65839 MeV by the factor of 1.0006.  

Thus, a row of leptons is built: muon, electron and hypothetical electrino whose masses 

are defined equally and correspond to the certain resonances.  

There is a question: whether is it possible to connect the masses of these particles by a 
uniform  dependence?  It  is  guessed  in  expression  (2.10).  In  case  of  a  muon  birth Emain=0.602 
MeV and differs from a rest mass energy of electron mec2=0.511 meV by the factor of 1.178. In 
case of electron birth Emain=14.1 eV it differs from the rest mass energy of electrino melc2=13.6 
eV already by the factor of 1.036. It would be seductive to use an outlined law for extrapolations 
aside low and high energies. Actually, the question on interrelation of leptons masses is not so 
simple. We shall consider it in Section 5. Here we are limited to the assumption that expression 
(2.10) can be used for calculation of the critical energy necessary for electrino birth, i.e.

While  we  shall  be  limited  to  this  assumption,  however  now  there  is  an  idea  that  on  a 
power scale there are critical values of energy at which there is a birth of corresponding particles 
in a resonant process. That is a reaction of proton in a free precession state. This brings up the 
question: what will take place if the energy of external influence gets in an interval between the 
specified critical values? The answer is prompted by experience. The fault of excessive energy 
will be carried out by electromagnetic radiation, but according to frequency parities, installation-
specific  for  periodic  systems.  We  shall  demonstrate  the  correctness  of  this  statement  by  an 
example of optical spectra.

Thus, in the proposed model the radiation is defined by differences of frequencies of the 
proton basic rotation. The choice of frequencies ν* submits to the rule n2hν*=hνx=mxc2. The 
particle  birth  occurs  at  the  frequencies  corresponding  to  a  condition  of  resonance  (2.13).  This 
concept  differs  from  Bohr's  model  according  to  which  radiation  takes  place  between  the 
quantized energy levels of electron rotating around the proton. The proposed model removes the 
difficulties  of  classical  physics  which  have  arisen  in  due  time  at  interpretation  of  the  optical 
spectrum of the hydrogen atom. Moreover, the model does not require use of electric interaction 
between  proton  and  electron.  We  shall  say  about  the  nature  of  the  electric  interaction  with 
reference to the nuclear phenomena below.

It  will  be  shown  below  that  introduction  of  spin  energy  of  electron  in  model  is  rather

masses of leptons. 
 

4. About the nature of elementary electric charge 

 
 
Let us build the following succession of reasonings. In the framework of the analogy of a 
material point rotating in a circle (or ring), the centripetal force F acting on a point is equal to 

F

=

  (m  -  weight,  V  -  orbital  velocity,  r  -  radius  of  a  circle).  We  shall  redefine  force  F

The  calculated  value  q=1,6029.10-19  C  differs  from  experimental  value е=1,602176.10-19  C  on 
factor 1,00046. 

It  is  noteworthy  that  mass  of  the  particle  was  excluded  when  we  derived  the  formula 
(4.5).  It  means  finally  that  any  irradiated  particle  should  have  the  same  electric  charge.  And 
naturally  one  can  make  a  conclusion  that  the  constancy  of  the  elementary  electric  charge  is  a 
consequence of the 3-rd law of Kepler, and its absolute value is initially set by velocity с/π at 
which a birth of any particle takes place. 

The  obtained  result  brings  us  to  a  fundamental  question  on  a  physical  sense  of  the 
elementary electric charge. In the book "Electrodynamics"  [8] A.Sommerfeld writes that we are 
compelled  to  accept  existence  of  electric  charges  as  a  reality  of  the  Nature.  All  attempts  to 
reduce  the  electric  phenomena  to  mechanical  ones  suffered  failure.  The  charge  was  prescribed 
own  dimension,  exceeding  the  bounds  of  mechanics.  Maxwell`s  theory  does  not  consider  the 
atomic structure of the charge at all. The charge is taken as an absolute constant. In Maxwell`s 
theory  the  concept  of  vector  D,  dielectric  displacement  (or  electric  excitation  under  offer 
Sommerfeld)  is  entered.  To  connect  the  concept  of  the  charge  with  the  viewpoint  of  the  field 
theory,  it  is  necessary  to  imagine  some  excitations  of  the  environment  which  start  with  the 
charged  center.  The  concept  of  the  charge  is  connected  historically  to  the  theory  of  the  long-
range action that existed in the 2-nd half of the XIX century and was practically forgotten. This 
theory  explained  the  phenomena  of  attraction  and  pushing  away  as  the  interaction  of  periodic 
systems[9].  

Return  to  this  theory  can  give  a  key  to  understanding  the  result  obtained  above  with 
calculation  of  the  elementary  electric  charge  value  because  it  was  obtained  owing  to 
consideration of birth of the charged particle as a resonance in a periodic process. After birth, the 
proton and electron, being in turn periodic systems, interact with each other, probably, under the 
laws  established  by  the  theory  of  long-range  action.  This  question  is  quite  complicated  and 
demands special studying.

The fine structure constant 

α

=

 (in system of SI) plays an important role 

in modern physics. Its occurrence in atomic physics is connected to observed splitting of spectral 
lines  of  atoms  explained  by  spin-orbital  interaction.  All  distances  between  the  components  of 
splitting  a  line  can  be  expressed  as  a  product  of  α2  on  rational  numbers.  The  theory  of  fine 
structure is built on the basis of relativistic consideration of keplerian motion of electron around 
the  nucleus.  In  quantum  electrodynamics  the  value  α  is  taken  as  a  constant  of  interaction  of 
photon  with  electron.  A.  Sommerfeld  emphasized  a  special  role  of  this  constant  because  in  it 
three  mainstreams  of  modern  physics  were  reflected:  the  electronic  theory  (a  charge  е),  the 
quantum theory (Planck's constant h) and the theory of relativity (speed of light с).  
The fine structure constant appears in our consideration as follows:

the relation of  ER=13,605667 eV and Emain=14,098727 eV (see 2.10). 

The  equality  (5.1)  should  hold  for  all  elementary  charged  particles  because  α  is  a 
universal constant. We shall see how it holds in a line of leptons if the particle with the rest mass

Thus,  the  interrelation  of  lepton  masses  with  each  other  and  with  the  proton  mass  is 
established  through  a  fine  structure  constant.  The  calculated  threshold  energies  coincide  with 
experimental ones. 

H

It is seen that a discrepancy arises with threshold value 

crE =14,1 eV which appeared to 
be  3,6  %  more  than  the  taken  value  of  potential  of  ionization  of  hydrogen  atom  of  hydrogen 
ionE =13,6  eV.  But  it  should  be  noted  that  this  value  was  not  obtained  in  direct  experiment. 
ionE   by 
Sommerfeld  took  note  of  that  [4].  Different  values  were  obtained  at  measurement  of 
ionE =15,34  eV  was  measured  in  experiences  with  electronic 
ionE   on  the  top  border  of 
ionE =14,098727 eV, and ER=13,605667 

various  methods.  For  example, 
impacts  in  system  Н2→+Н2+electron.  Finally,  it  was  agreed  to  take 
Layman series (on an optical limit). In our consideration 
eV is rest mass melc2 of the particle named "electrino".

Those ratios are performed exactly in row: electron – electrino – ch-particle.  

How much do these hypothetical particles correspond to the reality? We shall show that 
the  ch-particle  concerns  a  fine  structure  of  lines  of  the  optical  spectrum  of  atomic  hydrogen. 
Experiment[10]  has  shown  that  in  Balmer  series  lines  are  split  into  doublets  with  a  constant 
distance  between  components  ∆ν ≈ 36,45м-1  (in  a  scale  of  wave  numbers).  In  Sommerfeld`s 
theory  which  was  developed  on  the  basis  of  a  relativistic  consideration  of  keplerian  motion  of 

electron  around  the  nucleus,  the  value  ∆ν  is  expressed  as

From  the  viewpoint  of  our  approach,  construction  of  the  spectrum  of  the  ch-particle 
through  its  overtones,  similar  to  the  electrino  spectrum,  sounds  logical  (see  page  7).  It  should 

have  an  analogue  of  Balmer  series  where  the  first  term  is

exactly twice exceeds the energy of wave shift. In our understanding, the shift on the frequency, 
corresponding to ∆ν, takes place when the excitation energy exceeds the threshold corresponding 
to  the  electrino  birth.  Surplus  of  the  brought  energy  is  irradiated  as  quanta  whose  energy  is  a 
multiple energy of the rest mass of the ch-particle. 

The  value  of  super-thin  splitting  for  hydrogen  ∆ν=1,420405.109  Hz  (λ=0,211m, 
hv=5,87454.10-6 eV) was measured experimentally[11]. This value is obtained precisely from the

However, the experimental facts are needed to confirm the validity of such forecasts.

Thus,  the  critical  points  in  which  birth  of  particular  leptons  occur  is  designated  on  an 
energy scale. If to start from low energies, the rule (5.8) is observed up to electron. The hydrogen 
atom possesses enough internal energy for generation of younger leptons, and it reacts to weak 
external  influence  in  a  resonant  manner.  However,  for  generation  of  heavy  leptons  (muon  and 
etc.)  it  is  necessary  to  give  extra  energy  to  the  proton.  In  this  case  the  critical  values  are 
determined by the rule (5.2). 
 

6. About magnetic moments 
 

In  the  framework  of  the  presented  hypothesis,  another  idea  arises  on  the  magnetic 

moment of particles.  

In the existing theory the magnetic moment µ is defined as a product of closed current I 
on  streamline  area  S:  µ=IS.  Accepting  that  electron  moves  in  atom  on  a  circular  orbit,  a 
connection between the magnetic moment and the angular moment L=h/2π=ħ is established.

This  way  of  calculating  the  magnetic  moment  of  the  proton,  i.e.  by  dividing  µе  by  the 
relation  of  masses  of  the  proton  and  the  electron,  looks  a  little  bit  strange.  In  accordance  with 
definition µ=IS it means that either the current created by the proton decreases 1836 times at the 
expense  of  reducing  the  frequency  (the  charge  cannot  decrease),  or  the  area  of  the  contour 
reduces the same time (radius decreases ~43 times). According to Bohr`s model, the radius of the 
first electron’s orbit is equal to 0,528.10-10m, accordingly the rotation radius of the proton should 
be 43 times less, i.e. about 1,23.10-12m, what is not real. 

In the framework of the suggested model, the anomaly of the proton magnetic moment 
can be explained as follows. Considering the proton as a body undergoing simultaneously two 
rotations (the basic and precession ones), we have shown that the resonance arises, if the length 
of  the  wave  corresponding  to  a  particular  periodic  process  is  comparable  to  some  geometrical 
sizes. Let us pay attention that the double Compton length of the proton 2
pΛ  (accordingly, the 2 
time  smaller  frequency,  the  overtone  of  the  precession  frequency)  is  equal  to  the  length  of  the 
the  ellipsoid-proton).  Λр=1,32141.10-15m,

b=1,48711.10-16m.  We  also  have  established  that  the  hit  in  the  resonance  occurs  at  a  lower 

frequency (factor 

). The condition of appearing such a resonance can be written as: 

=

2.7915

                                                    

(6.3) 

The obtained value differs from 

 by the factor of ∆=1,00047. Thus, it is possible to 

assume that at experimental definition of the proton magnetic moment this resonance manifests 
itself  at  the  frequency  not  1836  times  smaller  than  it  was  expected,  but  at  the  frequency 
1836,1516
2, 7915

  times  smaller  the  frequency  of  precession  rotation.  If  to  uphold  the

Thus, in the suggested model the manifestation of the magnetic moment is reduced to a 
resonant effect. It is in agreement with the experimental practice in which the resonant methods 
of measurement of the magnetic moments are used. 
 

 
7. X-ray spectra and a nucleus 

X-ray spectra 
To show generality of the selected approach in the definition of the radiation spectra, we 
apply it to definition of spectra of characteristic X-ray radiation. Research on these spectra has 
shown that with reference to a specific chemical element with atomic number Z the structure of 
the spectrum submits the same ratio as the structure of optical spectra of a hydrogen atom. For 
each  element  some  series  are  allocated:  K,  L,  M  …,  in  which  the  observable  wavelengths  are 
determined by relation:

The form of expressions (7.1) is similar to expressions for definition of the structure of 
series of an optical spectrum of a hydrogen atom. First is similar to definition of Layman series 
and has a difference that R is replaced R(Z-1)2. The second expression is similar to definition 
of  Balmer  series;  accordingly,  R  is  replaced  R(Z-σ)2.  Such  a  replacement  follows  from  the 
empirical Mozely law that has found out a connection between values λКά and Z (7.2).

Practically  the  linear  dependence  of  number  QКά  from  Z  (fig.  6)  has  initiated  a  lot  of 
hypotheses  about  the  nature  of  the  characteristic  X-ray  radiation.  They  were  reduced  to  the 
following:  а)  this  radiation  arises  at  energy  transitions  in  internal  shells  of  atoms,  b)  electrons 
rotating  around  the  nucleus  shield  in  part  a  nucleus  charge,  c)  Rydberg  constant  plays  a 
particular fundamental role. It is necessary to note that Mozely law is of approximated character. 
The error at the determination of Z is shown on fig. 7.

  has  a  smooth  growth  with  small  recessions  aside  big  M.  It  is  seen  that 

these recessions coincide with the advent of natural radio-activity. They are marked on fig. 15. 
Restoration of stability takes places quite quickly. For example, in the area behind Bi (Po-Ra) it 
needs  5  atomic  numbers.  This  allows  one  to  make  a  conclusion  that  restoration  of  the  relative 
stability  will  take  place  and  in  the  area  Z>107  much  earlier  than  it  is  supposed  according  to 
theoretical representations available now. Identification of isotope 105Db268 with Т1/2=25h in [12] is 
the  indication  on  the  competency  of  such  an  assumption.  Fig.15  gives  a  hypothetical  stable 
nucleus 114А298 . It is seen that curve 

 tends to this point.

by ρ. It follows Mendeleyev's Periodic Law with allocation of peaks of alkaline elements. On the

Dependence  Vat=f(Z)  has  been  established  by  Meyer  at  the  end  of  the  XIX  century.  It  is 
considered that Vat does not mean the volume of one atom, but the volume of many atoms in a 
volume unit. It was also considered that the periodicity in the properties of elements is in no way 

is

reflected on the dependence ЕКά=f(Z) as X-ray spectra arise inside the atom, nearby a nucleus, 
instead  of  the  periphery  of  the  atom  where  optical  spectra  appear  and  where  the  action  of  the 
nucleus  charge  completely  weakens  due  to  shielding  of  the  internal  electrons  cloud  [4].  Now 
there is reason to be doubtful of this statement.

It is necessary to notice that we seemingly to run into contradiction by accepting the mass 
distributed  on  the  whole  volume  of  the  atom  but  not  concentrated  in  its  nucleus.  As  we  have 
found  out  earlier,  the  sizes  of  the  proton  are:  b ≈ 1.5·10-16m  and  а= 2 b ≈ 2.1·10-16m, 
≈ 20.10-48m3  (ellipsoid volume). In accordance with fig. 20, the volume

of  hydrogen  atom  is  equal  to VH ≈ 10.10-30m3  и ř=1,3.10-10м  (volume  and  radius  of  a  sphere). 

 

22

 

 

Therefore  one  can  conclude  that  the  density  of  matter  in  the  atom  changes  6  orders  along  its 
linear size from the nucleus to periphery. But under what law?  
 

About the chemical nature of elements 
The  further  analysis  of  the  known  experimental  data  shows  a  number  of  interesting 
peculiarities  in  the  periodicity  of  the  atom  properties.  They  are  related  to  the  periodicity  of 

nuclear volume Vat=f(Z) and to the relation 

 as well.

It  is  known  that  the  energy  of  single  ionization  of  atoms  Еion=f(Z)  correlates  with

This figure is a surprisingly informative one. The periodicity of the chemical properties 
of  elements  obtains  its  certain  quantitative  expression.  As  a  whole,  the  picture  is  similar  to  a 
unwrapping accordion. The periods of Mendeleyev`s table (from alkaline elements up to noble 
gases)  are  as  though  stretched  keeping  their  similarity.  This  is  clearly  seen  on  elements  B,  Al, 
Ga,  In,  Tl  incorporated  in  column  3А  of  the  Periodic  table.  It  is  known  that  the  number  of 
elements N in the periods submits rule N=2n2, n - an integer, i.e. N=2, 8, 18, 32 … Numbers 8 
and 18 repeat twice: 10Ne – 2He, 18Ar – 10Ne и 36Kr – 18Ar, 54Xe – 36Kr, number 32 "works" from 
54Xe up to  86Rn. The behaviour of dependence χ =f (Z) behind Fr suggests that the next period 
can contain more than 32 elements. Naturally, the dependence χ =f (Z) should be discussed, but 
it is not a subject of this work. 
 

General remarks 
The mentioned representation of experimental data on X-ray radiation gives basis to draw 
some  general  conclusions.  The  proton  and  the  atoms  of  elements  are  as  a  whole  the  periodic 
system  resounding  on  an  external  influence.  Reaction  to  external  influence  in  the  process  of 
increasing its energy is radiation of particles in the critical points determined in (2.15), while in 
the intervals - electromagnetic radiation, the spectrum of which submits to harmonious rules. The 

23

atoms  of  each  element  are  individual  on  their  physical  and  chemical  properties.  It  is  generally 
agreed that this individuality is defined, first of all, by atomic number Z, namely by the number 
of protons in a nucleus. In the suggested concept the role of Z looks different.  

We  have  convinced  that  the  reaction  of  atom  to  external  influence  in  an  X-ray  energy 
range is expressed by X-ray characteristic radiation (or radiation of Auger electrons). We have 
convinced that the energy of X-ray quanta depends not only on Z but it is directly proportional to 

the  product  ZM  with  small  variations  of  coefficient  ε,  depending  upon  value 

  and  upon 

M
Z

change  of  the  atomic  volume.  If  to  take  that  the  nucleus  of  an  atom,  similar  to  a  proton,  is  of 
ellipsoid form and is in a free precession, then it looks important to know the energy of the main 
rotation  and  its  velocity  after  the  nucleus  react  to  external  influence  by  changing  the  basic 
rotation  velocity  in  a  resonant  manner.  According  to  (2.2)

Why  does  the  number  of  protons  Z  in  a  nucleus  only  set  the  speed  of  rotation?  An 
explanation  to  this  fact  is  that  number  Z  for  each  particular  nucleus  designates  a  resonance 
arising  at  external  influence  on  the  nucleus  as  a  whole  rotating  body.  These  resonances  are 
distributed in a quadratic manner over the power scale and linearly over scale ZM. But it does 
not  mean  that  the  nucleus  is  a  continuous  body.  It  consists  of  separate  parts  which  we  name 
protons  and  neutrons  forming  a  granular  structure.  They,  in  turn,  undergo  rotation  connecting 
with  each  other  someway  and  forming  stable  structures  of  various  configurations.  Deviations 
from  the  stable  structure  under  effect  of  external  influence  or  internal  movement  result  in 
radioactive processes.  

By  what  is  the  stability  determined?  This  is  a  special  question.  In  paper[13]  there  is  an 
attempt  to  find  some  general  regularities.  The  author  proceeds  from  an  abstract  principle,  “the 
whole is stable, if it consists of the greatest number of parts, each is different one from another”. 
He  has  deduced  mathematical  expressions  for  calculation  of  magic  numbers  A  and  atomic 
numbers  C  for  noble  gases  (see  7.6a,b).  The  number  A  means  the  maximal  number  of  rotary 
degrees of freedom (including both the right-hand and left-hand rotation) realized in the system 
of  identical  particles  forming  a  shell,  plus  2  rotary  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  system  as  the 

 

24

whole.  Numbers  A  and  C  are  formed  in  essence  by  a  uniform  way  with  use  of  tools  of 
combinatory  mathematics.  The  numbers  of  natural  scale  n=1,  2,  3  …  are  some  quantum 
numbers.  The  known  magic  numbers  8,  20  and  40  drop  out  from  the  obtained  row,  but  the 
property  of  additivity  of  magic  numbers  is  known  too.  Therefore,  the  missing  numbers  are 
formed  as  2+6=8,  6+14=20,  20+20=40.  The  numbers  C  is  formed  by  deduction  from  A  of 
member 2n2 corresponding to the numbers of filling the periods of the Periodic system. It can be 
named  as  a  figure  game,  but  it  is  possible  that  such  an  approach  reflects  physical  contents. 
Formally the formulas (7.6а,b) are similar to quantum-mechanical expressions for description of 
the structure of atoms and nuclei. Probably, it is possible to find decisions of specific tasks on 
this way.

7. Conclusion 
 

From all the variety of physical processes we have allocated the particles related to weak 
interactions. Is it possible to apply the suggested approach to strong interactions? The author did 
not  study  this  question  specially.  However,  Gareeev's  paper[14]  gives  a  new  systematization  of 
elementary particle resonances  using  a  resonant  approach.  Practically  all  masses  of  resonances 
have  been  calculated  with  surprising  accuracy  in  the  assumption  that  its  decay  impulses  are 
multiple to a decay impulse of a pion: Рn=nPπ; n=1,2,3…, Pπ=29,7918 МeV/c. 

The  idea  of  similarity  of  the  physical  processes  available  in  various  energy  intervals  is 
not a new one. V.Weisskopf  [15] stated the generalizing ideas on  the structure of atomic optical 
spectra,  nuclear  spectra  and  a  mass  spectrum  of  elementary  particles.  R.Feynman[16]  built 
physical  processes  along  a  frequency  scale  designating  critical  points.  In  the  presented  paper 
such critical points are designated by birth of leptons with a certain mass. The author did not put 
the  task  to  analyze  in  details  the  processes  in  each  energy  range  and  to  review  the  existing 
theoretical representations. In the present paper a different original interpretation of the known 
experimental facts is given at estimation level only. 

The hypothesis suggested in this paper is based on the principles of classical physics. It 
contains  a  completely  different  sight  at  the  nature  of  elementary  physical  processes.  The 
simplicity and accuracy of the found decisions allow one to approve that the hypothesis is correct 
in its basis. At the same time, it is paradoxical. It is difficult to imagine that the free precession is 
the basic state of the proton. A necessary condition is a predetermined form of the proton as an 
ellipsoid (egg). Another necessary condition is the equality of the velocity of precession to the 
velocity of light, what is in a drastiс contradiction with the available representations. The mass of 
particles  and  electromagnetic  radiation  are  different  concepts  in  the  idea,  as  distinct  from  the 
supposed  electromagnetic  origin  of  mass.  At  the  same  time,  for  birth  of  heavy  leptons  as 
individual objects with a fixed mass it is required to spend energy. What way the energy converts 
into the mass is an ancient question, but the given hypothesis does not make it more clear. The 
refusal  of  the  concepts  of  electromagnetism  has  not  prevented  us  to  determine  correctly  the 
structure of optical spectra. In addition, the concepts of electric  charge  and  magnetic  moments 

 
 

 

25

have  received  a  mechanistic  interpretation.  Definition  of  spin  energy  has  enabled  to  connect 
weights of leptons through a constant of thin structure. In the hypothesis the quantum nature of 
nuclear  processes  has  the  other  content  and  reduces  to  resonant  processes  of  periodic  systems. 
The author realizes perfectly well that such serious statements look irritating, but he hopes that 
physicists will apprehend the presented results seriously.

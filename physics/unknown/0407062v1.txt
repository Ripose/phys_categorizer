Abstract 

The  difference  between  the  rf  voltage  seen  by  the  beam  and  the  accelerating 

voltage  required  to  match  the  rate  of  change  of  the  Booster  magnetic  field  is  used  to 

estimate  the  energy  loss  per  beam  turn.    Because  the  rf  voltage  (RFSUM)  and  the 

synchronous  phase  can  be  experimentally  measured,  they  can  be  used  to  calculate  the 

effective accelerating voltage.  Also an RFSUM reduction technique has been applied to 

measure  experimentally  the  RFSUM  limit  at  which  the  beam  loss  starts.    With 

information on beam energy loss, the running conditions, especially for the high intensity 

beam,  can  be  optimized  in  order  to  achieve  a  higher  intensity  beam  from  the  Fermilab 

Booster. 

Introduction 

The  energy  loss  per  beam  turn  in  a  Booster cycle  can  be  estimated  from  the  difference 

between the effective accelerating voltage and the accelerating voltage required by dB/dt.  

The measured synchronous phase (ϕs) [1] and RFSUM (V) [2] are used to calculate the 

effective  accelerating  voltage  (V×Sin(ϕs)).    RFSUM  is  the  vector  sum  of  rf  voltages  at 

the cavity gaps of all Booster rf stations.  Since one  can vary RFSUM to  values below 

normal  at  any  time,  [3]  it  is  useful  to  determine  experimentally  the  RFSUM  values  at 

which the beam loss starts.  Furthermore, how much rf voltage is used to provide the rf 

bucket  area,  as  well  as  the  longitudinal  emittance,  can  be  estimated  by  comparing  the 

RFSUM  limit  and  the  effective  accelerating  voltage.    Finally,  the  optimal  running 

condition  can  be  achieved  by  modifying  the  rf  amplitude  curve,  for  example  by

increasing the RFSUM during the transition crossing period to provide sufficient bucket 

area for a mismatched bunch developed right after transition, especially at high intensity.  

It may also be possible to decrease RFSUM in the early part of the cycle to maximize the 

transmission efficiency and control the longitudinal emittance growth at the same time. 

Experimental results 

All  data  were  taken  under  similar  conditions  with  the  extracted  beam  intensity  about 

5.1×1012  protons.    The  synchronous  phase  was  measured  using  the  synchronous  phase 

detector  recently  developed  for  the  Fermilab  Booster.[1]    Results  are  shown  in  Fig.  1.  

The method for determining the lower limit for RFSUM is to reduce it slowly to the value 

at which the beam loss starts.  The purpose of slow reduction is to avoid the complication 

of the beam recapture.[3]  In our experiment, the RFSUM limit was measured at 3.5 ms, 

6.5 ms, 9.5 ms, 12.5 ms, 15.5 ms, 18.5 ms, 21.5 ms, 24.5 ms, 27.5 ms, 30.5 ms, and 32 

ms  separately.    The  beam  was  injected  at  0  ms.    RFSUM  and  RFSUM  limit  were 

obtained by digitizing the results shown in Fig. 2.  Afterwards, the effective accelerating 

voltage is calculated using Eq. 1.

Here, VRFSUM(t) is the RFSUM at time t in a Booster cycle, and ϕs(t) is the synchronous 

phase at time t.  The RFSUM in a Booster cycle is shown as the black curve in Fig. 3.  

Also,  the  RFSUM  limit,  the  effective  accelerating  voltage,  and  the  accelerating  voltage 

required by dB/dt are shown as red curve, green curve and blue curve separately in Fig. 3.  

The early fluctuations in the effective accelerating voltage seem real and repeatable, and 

are  associated  with  the  fluctuations  in  RFSUM.    These  fluctuations  are  not  well 

understood.  The difference between the effective accelerating voltage (green curve) and 

the accelerating voltage required by the magnet ramp (blue curve) gives the information 

to estimate beam loading, as shown in Fig. 4. 

The bucket area of the beam can be calculated from the RFSUM limit and beam loading.  

Because the RFSUM limit is the minimum rf voltage which is required for providing the 

bucket area as well as compensating the energy loss per Booster turn.  Results are shown 

in Fig. 5.  The beam has a nearly constant bucket area of 0.05 eVs before transition and 

0.07  eVs  after  transition.    The  longitudinal  emittance  growth  is  about  40%  after 

transition,  and  it  is  smaller  than  one  expects.    The  effective  accelerating  voltage  is 

 

2

expected  to  be  higher  when  the  beam  intensity  goes  higher,  because  beam  loading 

linearly increases with the beam intensity, as shown in Fig. 6 [4], while the accelerating 

voltage required by dB/dt is independent of the beam intensity.  

Comments 

The RFSUM limit and the effective accelerating voltage are nearly equal near transition 

crossing,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.    This  implies  that  more  rf  voltage  will  be  needed  during 

transition crossing for Booster running at higher intensities.  However, there is too much 

rf  voltage  in  the  early  part  of  the  Booster  cycle,  and  this  is  true  even  at  high  intensity.  

One can expect more rf voltage from the Booster rf stations to be available at transition 

crossing if the rf accelerating voltage is lowered in the beginning of the cycle.  Booster 

could run at higher intensity either if the rf voltage curve is appropriately modified in the 

present rf configuration or if more rf stations are installed to provide more rf power near 

transition.

Abstract.   The polarizable vacuum (PV) representation of general relativity (GR), derived from a
model by Dicke and related to the “ THεµ” formalism used in comparative studies of gravitational
theories, provides for a compact derivation of the Levi-Civita Effect (both magnetic and electric),
herein demonstrated.

1.  INTRODUCTION

In  the  polarizable  vacuum  (PV)  representation  of  GR,  the  vacuum  is  treated  as  a
polarizable  medium  of  variable  refractive  index  [1].   Specifically,  based  on  the
isomorphism between Maxwell’s equations in curved space and a medium with variable
refractive index in flat space [2,3], the curved metric is treated in terms of variations in
the permittivity and permeability constants of the vacuum,  ε
o, along the lines of
the “ THεµ” formalism used in comparative studies of alternative gravitational theories
[4].  The PV approach, introduced by Wilson [5], developed by Dicke [6,7], and recently
elaborated by Puthoff [1], reproduces results predicted by GR for standard (weak-field)
astrophysical conditions while posing testable modifications for strong-field conditions
[1].   It  is  in  application  that  the  PV  approach  demonstrates  its  intuitive  appeal  and
provides additional insight into what is meant by a curved metric.  The derivation of the
Levi-Civita Effect presented herein provides just such an example.

2.  BACKGROUND

Paralleling  the  development  of  the  standard  tensor  formulation  of  GR,  alternative
approaches have emerged that provide convenient methodologies for investigating metric
changes in other formalisms.   Of particular utility in calculating the magnitudes of GR
effects while providing insight of an engineering nature is the formalism in which the
dielectric  constant  of  the  vacuum  plays  the  role  of  a  variable  refractive  index  under
conditions in which vacuum polarizability alters in response to GR-type influences.   In
this approach the bending of a light ray near a massive body is seen as due to an induced
spatial variation in the refractive index of the vacuum near the body, the reduction in the
velocity of light in a gravitational potential is due to an effective increase in the refractive
index,  and  so  forth.   This  optical-engineering  approach  has  been  shown  to  be  quite
general [8,9], and to reproduce to required order both the equations of GR, and the match
to the classical experimental tests of those equations.

3.  METHODOLOGY

The PV methodology employed here follows that of Ref. [1].  As explained in detail
there, the PV treatment of GR effects is based on an action principle (Lagrangian) that
holds  in  special  relativity,  but  with  the  modification  that  the  velocity  of  light c  in  the
Lorentz factors and elsewhere is replaced by the velocity of light in a medium of variable
refractive index, c/K; expressions such as  E = mc2   are still valid, but take into account
)  are now functions of K; the vacuum
that c → c/K; and E  = Eo K
polarization energy associated with the variable K  is  explicitly  included,  and  so  forth.
The Lagrangian density and resulting Euler-Lagrange particle and field equations that
lead to GR-compatible results to testable order are given in Appendix A.   For the Levi-
Civita Effect, we examine Eq. (A-3) as it applies to empty space (static case),

Here we see that changes in the vacuum dielectric constant K are driven by the energy
densities of the EM fields and the vacuum polarization.

4.  LEVI-CIVITA EFFECT

Soon  after  Einstein  published  his  theory  of  General  Relativity,  the  Italian
mathematical physicist Tullio Levi-Civita considered the possibility of the creation of an
artificial gravitational field via generation of a static uniform magnetic or electric field
(see  Appendix  B  for  a  detailed  description)  [10,11].   In  the  context  of  the  modern

investigation of the theory of traversable wormholes [12] it was originally thought by one
of us (Maccone) that the Levi-Civita spacetime metric would be considered a magnetic or
electric field induced wormhole, and examined its implications for interstellar travel and
communication  [13,14].   However,  it  was  later  proved  [15,16]  that  the  Levi-Civita
spacetime  metric  actually  describes  a  spatial  hypercylinder  with  a  position  dependent
gravitational potential, and possessing none of the required characteristics of a traversable
wormhole  (see  Appendix  B).   The  geometry  is  nonetheless  interesting  from  the
standpoint that it describes a unique cylindrically shaped “trapped” space.

5.  MAGNETIC HYPERCYLINDER SOLUTION IN THE PV FORMALISM

To examine the magnetic Levi-Civita Effect, we consider the case of a homogeneous,
static magnetic field oriented in the z direction (e.g., in the interior of a solenoid).  Eq. (1)
then takes the form

d 2 K
dz 2

= 1
K

⎡ 
⎛

⎜

⎟ 
⎠ 

− 4πGB 2
µ
0c4

⎤ 
⎥ 
⎥ 
⎦ 

,

where we have used  ∇K(

(
) 2 = 4K ∇ K

)2

.

The solution to (2) takes the form

where we have placed the maximum deviation of K from unity at the origin, and the as-
yet-undetermined integration constants α and β are found to satisfy the constraint

K = αcosβz

,

α2β2 = 4πGB2
0c 4

µ

.

(2)

(3)

(4)

For  even  the  strongest  fields  of  interest  (e.g.,  those  of  pulsars,  B ~ 109   Tesla)
perturbation of the spacetime metric is sufficiently small that Eq. (3) can be approximated
by

K ≈ α 1−

⎛ 
⎜ 
⎝ 

β2z2
2

⎞ 
⎟ 
⎠ 

.

       (5)

We  now  determine  the  constants  α  and  β  by  requiring  that  the  velocity  of  light
′ c  z( ) = c / K z( ) transitions to c (i.e., K=1) at a certain distance L/2 above and below the
origin  (e.g.,  at  the  ends  of  a  solenoid  of  length  L  centered  at  the  origin).   With  the
constants thereby determined, we obtain the solution

and thus the velocity of light 

′ c  z( ) within the magnetic field region is given by

K ≈ 1 + 2πGB2
µ
0c4

⎡ 
⎛

⎦

Therefore  the  velocity  of  light  is  slowed  within  the  magnetic  field,  with  its  minimum
value at the origin, equidistant from the ends of the magnetic field region.   The transit
time for a light ray through the magnetic field region is thus not L/c but rather

6. ELECTRIC HYPERCYLINDER SOLUTION IN THE PV FORMALISM

The  solution  for  the  electric  Levi-Civita  Effect  parallels  the  magnetic  case.   We
consider a homogeneous static electric field oriented in the z direction (e.g., between two
charged plates).  For the electric field case Eq. (1) takes the form

d 2 K
dz 2

= 1
K

⎡ 
⎛

⎥ 
⎦ 

.

       (9)

The solution to (9) takes the form

K = αsechβz

,

     (10)

where again we have placed the maximum deviation of K from unity at the origin.  Here
the integration constants α and β satisfy the constraint

As in the magnetic case it can be assumed that for even the strongest fields of interest
perturbation  of  the  spacetime  metric  is  sufficiently  small  that  Eq.  (10)  can  be
approximated by

β2 = 4πε
0GE 2

K ≈ α 1−

⎛ 
⎜ 
⎝

⎞ 
⎟ 
⎠ 

.

     (11)

     (12)

Following the procedure for the magnetic case, we require that the velocity of light
′ c  z( ) = c / K z( ) to c at L/2 above and below the origin (e.g., at charged
transition from 
plates spaced L apart and centered at the origin).  With the constants thereby determined,
we obtain the solution for the electric hypercylinder case as

The velocity of light 

′ c  z( ) within the electric field region is therefore given by

K ≈ 1 + 2πε

7. CONCLUSION

In this short note we demonstrate how the polarizable vacuum (PV) formulation of
general  relativity  (GR)  lends  itself  to  straightforward  and  compact  derivations  of  GR
effects, in this case the Levi-Civita Effect for both the magnetic and electric field induced
hypercylinder  space  cases.   Specifically,  it  is  shown  how  the  perturbation  of  the
spacetime metric by the presence of uniform, static magnetic and electric fields can be
understood  as  a  perturbation  of  the  effective  refractive  index  of  the  vacuum,  and
summarized in terms of its effect on the propagation of a light ray through the region
containing the fields.

We  see  in  (A-2)  that  accompanying  the  usual  Lorentz  force  is  an  additional
dielectric force proportional to the gradient of the vacuum dielectric constant. This term
is equally effective with regard to both charged and neutral particles and accounts for the
familiar gravitational potential, whether Newtonian in form or taken to higher order to
account for GR effects.  In (A-3) we see that changes in the vacuum dielectric constant K
are driven by mass density (first term), EM energy density (second term), and the vacuum
polarization  energy  density  itself  (third  term).  Eqns.  (A-2)  and  (A-3),  together  with
Maxwell's equations for propagation in a medium with variable dielectric constant, thus
constitute the master equations to be used in discussing general matter-field interactions
in a vacuum of variable dielectric constant as employed in the PV formulation of GR.

Levi-Civita’s spacetime metric for a static uniform magnetic field [10] was originally

expressed by Pauli in the form [11]:

where  c1  and  c2   are integration constants that are determined by appropriate boundary
conditions,  and  x1… x 4   are  Cartesian  coordinates  ( x1… x 3  =  space,  x 4   =  time)  with
orthographic projection.  The important parameter in (B-1) is:

               (B-2)

which measures the radius of spacetime curvature induced by a homogeneous magnetic
field with cylindrical symmetry (axis,  x 3 = z ) about the direction of the field (quantities
expressed  in  MKSA  units).   Note  that  (B-1)  is  also  the  spacetime  metric  for  a  static

uniform electric field in which the magnetic field intensity in (B-2) is replaced by the
electric  field  intensity  E  along  with  an  appropriate  change  in  the  related  vacuum
electromagnetic constants (i.e.,  B µ
→ E ε
o ).   The metric in (B-1) does not form a
traversable  wormhole  according  to  [15,16].   To  clarify  this  point  we  change  the
c y l i n d r i c a l  
c o o r d i n a t e s
c o o r d i n a t e  
s y s t e m  
), which transforms (B-1) into the form [15,16]:

dr2 + r2dϕ2 + dz 2             (B-3)

This is a simpler form, and we can now inquire as to what spacetime geometry the Levi-
Civita metric specifically describes.  This is clarified this by a change of (radial) variable,
r = asinθ, dr = a(cosθ)dθ, and substitution into (B-3) to obtain:

[
ds2 = − c1 exp z a(

]2
)

dt2 + a2 dθ2 + sin 2 θdϕ2

[

[

where  a   is  the  constant  radius  defined  in  (B-2).   The  spatial  part  of  (B-4),
] + dz2 ,  is  recognized  as  the  three-metric  of  a  hypercylinder
dσ2 = a 2 dθ2 + sin 2 θdϕ2
S 2 × ℜ .  So (B-4) reveals that the Levi-Civita spacetime metric is simply a hypercylinder
with a position dependent gravitational potential possessing no asymptotically flat region,
no flared-out wormhole mouth and no wormhole throat.

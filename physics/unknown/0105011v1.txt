Abstract - A simple general relativity theory for objects moving in gravitational fields is developed
based  on  studying  the  behavior  of  an  atom  in  a  gravitational  field.  The  approach  to  the  new  theory
introduced here is radically different from the geometric approach used by Einstein's general relativity. The
theory is field based where the potential energy of a system of masses can be easily calculated and the force
can be found as the gradient of the potential field in analogy to the Newtonian mechanics. The resulting field
equations become the traditional Newton's equations when week gravitational effects are present. The theory
complies  with  all  the  known  experimental  results  such  as  the  gravitational  time  dilation  and  faster  light
speeds higher in the gravitational field. The special relativity theory of an object moving without experiencing
gravitational fields can be derived directly from the gravitational field equations introduced here. The theory
introduced here has crucial differences to Einstein's general relativity theory. For example, the gravitational
field cannot accelerate an object to higher than the speed of light and the event horizon of a black hole (where
light cannot escape) has to be of zero radius, essentially meaning that light can escape any object unless the
object has infinite density. Another primary consequence of this study is that the principle of equivalence of
gravitational and inertial mass has only limited validity and  a  new  definition  of  gravitational  mass  is  given
here. Besides its extreme simplicity as compared to Einstein's general relativity, the new theory removes all
the known infinities and puzzles that can result from Einstein's general relativity and Newtonian mechanics.
In  addition,  the  new  theory  is  in  full  compliance  with  quantum  mechanical  concepts  and  can  represent  a
milestone in reconciling gravitational forces with quantum mechanics. It is even shown that the very essence
of  quantum  mechanics  is  gravitational  in  nature.  Also,  electrons  are  shown  to  be  black  holes.  Finally,  a
striking relation between the potential energy stored in the universe and the total mass energy of the universe
flows  naturally  from  the  field  equations  introduced  here  which  explains  an  observation  that  Feynman
referred to as the great mystery.

I. Introduction

In this paper, a radically different approach from Einstein's geometric model is followed
to  arrive  at  a  relativistic  gravitational  field  model.  This  new  model  is  based  on  examining  the
behavior of  an atom  moving in a gravitational field and generalizing the  observations  deduced
from this behavior. An atom is one of the basic structures of the universe where energy and mass
are  bound  together  and  are  interchangeable.  Hence,  the  observations  made  by  examining  the
behavior of an atom in a gravitational field can be extended to larger objects. In addition to the
behavior  of  an  atom  in  a  gravitational  field,  the  principle  of  relativity  is  maintained  when
deriving the field equations. Einstein's definition of the principle of relativity [1], [2] is used here
which  states  that  all  the  physical  laws  should  be  maintained  in  different  frames  of  reference.
Alternatively,  if  an  experiment  is  performed  and  observed  at  a  certain  frame  of  reference,  the
results should be identical to when the experiment is repeated and observed in a different frame

of reference. The definition of a frame of reference depends on the speed of the frame in special
relativity  [1].  Another  definition  is  given  later  in  this  paper  for  a  frame  of  reference  in  a
gravitational field based on an atom's behavior.

Using the approach described above, simple field equations are derived that describe a
complete relativistic gravitational model where all the effects of a distribution of masses in space
can be deduced, including motion, energy conservation, and time dilation. The new theory also
removes  the  flows  and  contradictions  that  result  from  the  general  relativity  theory.  One  may
wonder  how  a  simpler  model  can  be  more  accurate  and  more  correct.  A  good  example  is  the
Aristotle-Potlemy  model  of  the  solar  system  versus  Copernicus's  model.  When  Potlemy
developed  his model, he assumed the  earth  to  be  at  the  center  based  on  Aristotle's  assumption
and insisted on finding the orbits of all the planets and the sun around the earth. The result was
an  extremely  complex  model.  By  following  other  leads,  Copernicus  arrived  at  a  much  simpler
and more intuitive model by putting the sun at the center and making plants orbit the sun. This
shows that one different fundamental assumption that a theory is based on can lead to extremely
different models. Also, it shows that the reality of physics is usually simple and intuitive. If the
developed model is not so, then probably something is wrong or missing.

There is a large amount of evidence that is provided in the paper for the correctness of
the new model and its compliance with most of the known physical facts about gravitation. The
first evidence is the way the model  is derived. When we  start  by  an  atom  and  the  principle  of
relativity and arrive at all the known effects of gravitation, then this shows consistency in favor
of the new approach. A second major evidence is that all the equations of the special theory of
relativity can be directly derived from the new gravitational model as a special case despite the
fact  that  the  approach  used  to  derive  the  gravitational  model  uses  nothing  from  the  special
relativity  theory.  Other  evidences  come  from  the  self-consistency  of  the  new  model.  For
example, the derived potential is such that if an observer at higher potential sees another observer
at lower potential twice as slow, the lower observer sees the higher one twice as fast. Note that
Newtonian-like potentials cannot support such a behavior as will be explained later. Another set
of  evidence  comes  from  the  physical  and  intuitive  nature  of  the  solution  where  many  of  the
infinities  and  puzzles  of  gravitation  are  eliminated.  Also,  the  gravitational  model  shows
unmistakable relations to quantum mechanics, which can be a milestone in unifying gravitation
and quantum mechanics. It is actually shown that gravitation is the fundamental force controlling
the interactions between photons and electrons. Dirac among many other scientists struggled to
undertake  the  impossible  task  of  unifying  general  relativity  with  quantum  mechanics  [3],  and
naturally, all failed. This task is referred to here as impossible since general relativity has subtle
flows  that  appear  exactly  where  quantum  mechanics  and  gravitation  meet  (i.e.,  at  very  high
gravitational  effects)  as  will  be  explained.  The  mathematical  complexity  of  general  relativity
makes discovering such subtleties a formidable task.

In  addition  to  the  above  evidences,  one  major  evidence  comes  from  the  natural  and
successful  explanation  of  a  previously  unexplained  observation  at  the  cosmological  level.  By
using the available estimates of the universe density and size, many people have pointed  out a
"spectacular coincidence" as Feynman refers to it in his lectures on gravitation [4]. This fact is
that if the total potential energy stored in the universe is calculated, it is found to be  the  same
order of magnitude as the total energy stored in the mass of the universe (given by Mc2, where M
is  the  total  mass  of  the  universe  and  c  is  the  speed  of  light)  [4],  [5].  The  field  equations
introduced  here  show  that  these  two  quantities  have  to  be  exactly  equal  for  any  system  of
masses, not only for the universe because of some huge coincidence. The general relativity can

2

provide no explanation of this fact and that is why Feynman referred to it as a great mystery. To
quote Feynman, he referred to this observation as "With this estimate, we get the exciting result
that the total energy of the universe is zero. Why this should be so is one of the great mysteries -
and  therefore  one  of  the  important  questions  of  physics.  After  all  what  would  be  the  use  of
studying physics if the mysteries were not the most important things to investigate." See page 10
of [4]. This fact has large physical implications as will be explained.

The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  section  II,  the  quantum  mechanical
behavior of an atom in a gravitational field and the concept of relativity are used to derive the
physical laws governing gravitation. In section III, the field equations are derived and shown to
reduce to Newton's equations at low gravitation. The energy conservation and deduction of the
special relativity equations from  the gravitational model are  also discussed  in  section  II.  Some
physical  implications  of  the  new  gravitational  model  are  discussed  in  section  IV  including  the
"great mystery" and relations to quantum mechanics. In section V, the fundamental differences
in  the  assumptions  underlying  this  theory  and  those  underlying  general  relativity  are  stressed.
Several important questions are considered in section V such as why does general relativity seem
to  work  (for  example  in  calculating  Mercury's  orbit),  where  it  fails,  and  what  physical
contradictions can general relativity cause. Finally, conclusions are given in section VI.

II Physical Concepts Underlying Gravitation

The physical concepts and laws governing gravitation are established in this section. The
behavior of an atom in gravitation is discussed in subsection A from which the gravitational time
dilation  and  frequency  shifts  can  be  directly  deduced.  In  subsection  B,  it  is  shown  that  the
principle of relativity implies space dilation in association with gravitation. This space dilation is
shown  to  be  necessary  for  compliance  with  the  known  results  of  the  varying  speed  of  light  in
gravitational fields which  causes light to fall into gravitational fields. In subsection C, a major
contradiction  between  the  principle  of  equivalence  of  inertial  and  gravitational  masses  [2]  and
energy  conservation is pointed out and hence the principle of  equivalence has  to  be  discarded.
Note that the fact that gravitational and inertial mass are not generally equal does not contradict
well known experiments that illustrate their equivalence as will be explained in subsection C. A
definition  of  gravitational  mass  is  thus  given  and  its  relation  to  energy  and  inertial  mass  are
discussed.

A.  Behavior of Atoms in Gravitational Fields

In this section, Bohr's model of a hydrogen atom [6] is used to investigate the effects of
gravitation. A hydrogen atom has one electron orbiting a heavy nucleus with one proton and one
neutron  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  According  to  Bohr's  model,  the  electron  is  allowed  only  specific
orbits related to the energy of the electron. The radii of these orbits are given by

where n is an integer taking the values 1, 2, 3, … and rn is the nth allowed electron orbit with n =
1 representing the orbit closest to the nucleus. The mass and charge of an electron are given by
me and e, respectively. h is Plank's constant and e
o is the permittivity of vacuum. The velocity of
the electron at the nth orbit is given by

For an electron to move from one orbit to an adjacent orbit, the electron has to absorb or emit a
photon carrying the amount of energy given by the energy difference of the two orbits. Hence,
for an electron to move from the second to the first orbit, the electron has to emit a photon with a
frequency given by

since the energy of a photon is given by the well known formula Eph = hfph.

Now consider moving an atom from a low position close to the earth surface to a higher
position  (say  into  a  satellite).  The  atom  gains  gravitational  potential  energy  which  can  be
retained as kinetic energy if the atom freely falls under the effect of gravity. But where exactly
does this energy go and how is it distributed among the different energies constituting the atom.
A  good  point  to  start  with  is  to  consider  what  happens  to  the  constituent  particles  (such  as
electrons and protons) of the atom as they are raised individually against gravitation. The inertial
mass of a particle of mass m at earth increases to m+Epot/c2 where the famous formula E = mc2 has
been  employed  and  Epot  is  the  potential  energy  gained  by  the  mass  m.  Hence,  the  mass  of  the
electron at the higher position is given by

Note that l  is independent of the mass of the object and only depends on the starting and ending
positions of the object. This result is due to the fact that Epot gained by any object is proportional
to the mass of this object as will be illustrated later. Note also that l  represents the increase in the
total energy of the body as it moves from a lower to a higher potential since the total energy of
the  body  is  given  by  mc2.  By  substituting  (5)  into  Bohr's  atom  model,  the  following  relations

The radius of the atom shrinks by l , the velocity of the electron in any orbit remains constant,
the binding energy of the electrons increases by l , and the photons emitted by the atom are blue
shifted  by  a  factor  of  l .  Note  that  the  number  of  revolutions  of  the  electron  around  the  atom
increases by a factor of l  since the speed remains constant while the orbit radius shrinks. Thus,
the potential energy gained by the whole atom is distributed uniformly among the masses of the
constituting particles, the binding energy, and the emitted or absorbed photons, with each type of
energy increasing by a factor of l . Bohr's atom model guarantees both the conservation of energy
and the uniformity of energy distribution in the atom, which makes physical sense since there is
no reason the added potential energy should concentrate in one type of energy rather than others.
Note  also  that  an  emitted  photon  travelling  with  the  speed  of  light  would  travel  the  distance
occupied by a number of atoms that increases by l  at high positions as compared to earth since
the size of each atom has shrunk by l .

Several  observations  in  agreement  with  the  known  effects  of  gravitation  can  be  made
based on the above discussion. For someone observing the high atom from earth, he will notice
that  the  number  of  revolutions  of  the  electron  around  the  atom  has  increased  in  relation  to  a
similar atom on earth. If he takes that as a measure of time, he can interpret this observation as
time is running faster at the higher potential. Also, he will notice that the photons emitted by the
higher atom are blue shifted relative to the photons emitted by an atom on earth. This blue shift
is a well-known effect of gravitation [4]. To see what an observer at the same height as the atom
notices, assume l  = 2. This observer will measure that a photon has traveled between two points
a distance given by twice that he would measure at earth since all his measuring rods (made of
atoms) shrunk in size. However, he also measures the time taken to cut the distance between the
two  points  as  doubled  since  his  clock  works  twice  as  fast.  Hence,  the  higher  observer  will
measure the same speed of light and won't feel any change in the physical laws as required by
the principle of relativity. He would also shrink in size so he cannot tell that anything has shrunk
around him.

B. Space Dilation

The  above  study  of  the  behavior  of  an  atom  in  a  gravitational  field  shows  very  good
agreement with the known effects of gravitation and the principle of relativity which states that
someone moving from one frame of reference to another frame of reference should experience
the same physical laws. Alternatively, a person should have absolutely no way to tell that he has

(6)

(7)

5

changed his frame of reference by making any experiment in his frame of reference. Now is a
good  point  to  make  a  more  precise  definition  of  a  frame  of  reference  for  stationary  (or  low
speed) objects in a gravitational field. A frame of reference in a gravitational field is defined here
as  an  equipotential  surface.  This  definition  is  due  to  the  fact  that  it  is  potential  energy  that
changes the time and atom sizes in such a way that any observer in the same potential will not
feel  any  change  in  the  physical  laws.  However,  an  observer  at  a  different  potential  would  see
changes in the physical  laws and quantities when observing  an object that changes its position
moving between different potentials.

However,  there  is  a  serious  violation  of  the  principle  of  relativity.  Consider  a  person
measuring the distance between two objects in his frame of reference using his rulers. The two
objects have vacuum in between (see Fig. 2). As he moves to a higher potential, his rulers shrink.
If we assume that space does not shrink he will measure more distance as he moves to a higher
potential and thus be able to tell that he has changed his frame of reference in direct violation to
the principle of relativity. In fact there are numerous experiments that will violate the principle of
relativity if space does not shrink.

Hence,  the  space  should  shrink  with  a  factor  1/l ,  which  is  the  same  as  the  shrinking
factor of an atom to maintain the principle of relativity. In this case, an observer moving from a
lower potential to a higher one will measure exactly the same distance between any two points in
his  frame  of  reference.  Note  also  that  this  space  shrinking  is  omni-directional  since  the  atom
shrinks in size in all directions. Moreover, the higher observer will not perceive an object in his
frame smaller than a similar object at a lower potential since the whole space has shrunk from his
point of view  including  the  lower  objects.  See  Fig.  3.  Hence,  as  objects  change  their  frame  of
reference they always perceive similar objects at other frames as of the same size. Alternatively,
the size of objects at any frame of reference appears to same no matter which frame of reference
they are observed from.

This space shrinking is also necessary for the conservation of energy in electromagnetic
fields. For example consider two charges that move form a lower potential to a higher one. The
distance between the two charges shrinks by a factor of 1/l . Hence, the force between the two
charges increases as l 2 since the electromagnetic force has an inverse square dependence on the
distance  between  charges.  The  potential  energy  between  the  two  charges  is  given  by  the
integration  of  Fdr,  where  F  is  the  force  between  the  two  charges  and  dr  is  an  incremental
distance between two points. Hence, the potential energy increases linearly with l  as required by
the  law  of  conservation  of  energy.  Also,  the  quadratic  increase  with  l   of  the  force  between
charges will make all the movements of the charges faster in proportion to l  which is required by
the principle of relativity since all the clocks also run faster.

Now we have to update our view of how the lower observer will observe the changes in
an atom's behavior as it is raised to a higher gravitational potential. The lower observer will see
the atom having the same size as on earth. He will still see the electron making a larger number
of  revolutions  around  the  nucleus  per  second,  which  he  will  interpret  as  the  electron  is  going
faster, and he will see the emitted photons blue shifted. Most importantly, he will see the speed
of light at the higher potential as larger than the speed of light on earth. This is a well-known fact
and causes the light to fall (or bend) under the effect of gravity. Actually, this is the observation
that initiated Einstein's interest in gravitation and led to the theory of general relativity. Hence, in
summary, the lower observer will see all the objects at a higher potential having the same size
and  will  see  everything  at  the  higher  potential  faster  than  in  his  frame,  including  the  speed  of
light.  A  higher  observer  will  see  all  the  processes  slower  at  the  lower  potential.  Also,  all  the
physical laws will be maintained no matter what frame of reference an experiment is conducted
in given that the results are observed from the same frame of reference.

C.  Inertial and Gravitational Mass

So  far,  it  was  shown  that  all  the  phenomena  of  gravitation  can  be  deduced  from  the
behavior  of  an  atom  in  a  gravitational  field  and  by  maintaining  the  principle  of  relativity.  If
someone did not know any of the gravitational effects he could have deduced them in the manner
described in the preceding sections. Note that this is an important result since all the effects of
gravitation have been deduced using quantum mechanics which is well-known not to match the
theory of general relativity.

However, the effect of gravitation on one more process is not discussed yet. This is the
effect of gravitational potential on gravitation. To illustrate what this means, consider two small
objects  of  masses  m1  and  m2  moving  from  one  frame  of  reference  to  another  in  the  field  of  a

7

much larger mass M. See Fig. 4. An observer in the same frame of reference of the two masses
will measure a force between the two masses given by Newton's law as

where r is the distance between the two bodies and G is the gravitational constant as defined in
Newton's law. The potential energy change in this system of two masses as the distance between
the two of them change from r1 to r2 is given by

Finally, if the two masses start at rest at a distance d from each other and are only acted upon by
the gravitational force between them in the direction of the line connecting the radii, the speed of
m2 at any radius r < d when m1 is held in position is given by

Now if the two masses are moved to a higher potential, and if the gravitational mass is
assumed equal to the inertial mass, then both m1 and m2 should increase in all the above equations
by  a  factor  of  l .  Also,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  space  dilation  is  necessary  to
maintain the principle of relativity. Hence, the space between the two masses shrinks by a factor
of 1/l . These transformations results in the following relations

(11)

These relations directly violate the law of conservation of  energy  since  all  the  energies  should
increase by a factor of l . Also, the principle of relativity is violated since the time at which the
two particles collide will decrease quadratically with l  since the speed increased while the space
between  the  two  masses  decreased  with  l .  Hence,  an  observer  making  experiments  involving
gravitation  and  other  forces  such  as  the  electromagnetic  force  or  atomic  processes  would  find
that the experiment changes as he moves to a higher position. If he is using an atomic clock to
measure the time at which the two particles collide, he will find this time decreasing as he moves
to a higher potential since his clock speeds up linearly with l  while the collision time speeds up
quadratically  with  l .  Also,  the  ratio  between  the  electromagnetic  and  gravitational  forces
changes  as  the  frame  of  reference  changes.  Hence,  all  the  physics  and  experiments  involving
gravitation are scrambled if performed at higher positions or if some other heavy object comes
close to earth.

the field of a much larger mass M.

A  way  to  resolve  all  these  inconsistencies  is  to  question  the  principle  of  equivalence.
Assume two different types of masses, the gravitational mass which determines the gravitational
force and the inertial mass which determines the acceleration due to any type of force. Also, it is
assumed that the energy does not add to the gravitational mass while it adds to inertial mass. The
gravitational  mass  is  differentiated  from  the  inertial  mass  by  adding  a  g  suffix  to  the  mass.
Hence,  m1  is  the  inertial  mass  while  m1g  is  the  corresponding  gravitational  mass.  Under  these
assumptions, equations (8)-(10) become

Using  these  relations,  as  the  experiment  is  performed  at  a  higher  potential,  the  following
transformations in the gravitational force, potential energy, and speed result

Note that the gravitational mass remains constant while the inertial mass increases. These results
are  in  complete  compliance  with  energy  conservation  and  with  the  principle  of  relativity.  The
gravitational force, electromagnetic force, and all other forces scale quadratically with l . Also,
the time it takes for the two masses to collide decreases by l  since the speed remains constant
while the distance shrinks. Hence, all the physical laws and energy conservation are maintained
under this model.

But  what  about  all  the  experiments  that  have  been  performed  to  detect  any  difference
between the gravitational and inertial mass and concluded to a very high degree of accuracy that
these masses are equal. The answer is that all these experiments can never detect any difference
since the experiments are performed and the results are observed in the same frame of reference.

A person will never be able to detect any difference between the gravitational and inertial mass
in his frame of reference. To clarify this statement, consider some one measuring the two masses
once on earth and another at a higher position. As the experiment is moved to a higher position,
the  gravitational  mass  remains  constant  while  the  inertial  mass  increases  by  a  factor  of  l .
However, when performing experiments to measure the inertial mass in the higher position, the
same value will result as that measured on earth because the inertial mass has increased but so
did all the forces and energies. The changes are always such that the same value for inertial mass
is always measured, which is actually required by the principle of relativity. This behavior is in
analogy  to  the  speed  of  light.  The  speed  of  light  will  always  be  measured  the  same  no  matter
what frame of reference the experiment is performed in. However, when observing the speed of
light from a different frame of reference, the value changes. Einstein's thought experiments about
gravitational and inertial mass as well as all the experiments performed to detect any difference
between these two masses were performed in the same frame of reference. Hence, the principle
of equivalence, on which the general relativity theory is based, has fatal flows. Also, as will be
discussed in section V, the principle of equivalence leads to violation of energy conservation in
atoms based on the quantum mechanical model of an atom and causes non-uniform scaling of the
physical forces.

The following definitions and rules can be made about gravitational and inertial mass:

1.  The  gravitational  mass  of  a  body  is  the  mass  measured  by  any  kind  of  experiment  in  any

frame of reference.

2.  The gravitational mass determines the force of gravitation.
3.  This mass remains the same when viewed from any frame of reference.
4.  The  previous  point  can  also  be  restated  as:  energy  does  not  add  to  gravitational  mass.
Gravitational  mass  is  conserved  in  the  same  way  the  charge  is  conserved  [1],  [7]  when  a
body moves between frames of reference.

5.  The inertial mass is the mass determining the acceleration of a body when acted on by forces.
6.  Energy (from potential or motion) adds to this mass.
7.  Thus, this mass appears different when viewed from different frames of reference.
8.  The inertial and gravitational masses are always equal when measured in the same frame of

III. Relativistic Gravitational Field Model

In  this  section  simple  relativistic  field  equations  are  derived  based  on  the  physical
characteristics  of  gravitation  that  were  discussed  in  the  previous  section.  The  potential  field
equations  are  first  derived  for  the  special  case  of  two  masses  in  subsection  A  where  the  basic
characteristics of the new potential field are discussed. The potential field equations are extended
to  multi-mass  systems  in  subsection  B.  In  subsection  C,  the  type  of  kinetic  energy  that  is
conserved under the new potential field is derived and the special relativity equations are shown
to naturally result from the potential field. Finally, the general equations governing the motion of
masses under the effect of gravity are discussed in subsection D.

Fig. 5. An object of mass mg is moved from a distance r1 to a larger distance r2 in the
gravitational field of another mass Mg.

Consider  a  mass  mg  that  is  moved  from  a  distance  r1  to  a  larger  distance  r2  in  the
gravitational field of another mass Mg as shown in Fig. 5. The body gains potential energy due to
moving it against the gravitational force. This potential energy can be found by integrating the
incremental  energy  gained  by  mg  when  the  body  is  moved  a  small  distance  dr  at  a  distance  r
where r varies from r1 to r2. However, this potential energy has to be referred to some frame of
reference since  each observer measures  energy  differently  according  to  his  frame  of  reference.
An observer at r1 would measure the same amount of energy higher by l  as compared to what an
observer at r2 would measure. When referred to r1, the force acting on mg at a radius r is given by

The reason the l 2 factor appears in the above equation is that mg sees a space that is shrunk at a
radius r by a factor of l  with respect what an observer at r1 sees and hence, mg feels itself closer
to Mg by a factor of l , increasing the force quadratically. The incremental energy  added to the
body when moving a distance dr is given by F(r)dr/l  which is given by

dE

g

r
The division by  l  is because the distance  dr as seen by an observer at  r1 appears smaller by  a
factor  of  l   in  the  reference  frame  of  mg  due  to  the  space  shrinking.  Since  Epot1  is  taken  as  the
reference, Epot1 can be set to zero which results in l (r) given by

which are simply the Newtonian potential energy change when mg moves form r1 to r2 and from
r2 to r1, respectively. This is a very important feature since Newton's law has proved exceptional
success at low gravitational effects.

21 and l

Another important feature is that the dilation factors l

12 are the reciprocal of each
other. This is a crucial feature for the solution  to  be  physically  meaningful.  This  characteristic
indicates that if an observer at r1 sees processes running twice as fast at r2, then an observer at r2
sees processes running twice as slow at r1, which is a physical requirement. The same can be said
about space dilation (which maintains the same sizes of objects when perceived from different
frames) and all types of energy. Note also that the maximum time and space dilations are infinity
and the minimum is zero. The infinite value results only if there is some mass inside a radius r1 =
0, which necessarily implies an infinite density. No negative or imaginary quantities are allowed.
This is also a physically intuitive result since the theory can produce no infinities with masses of
finite density. Also, no negative or imaginary time or journeys to the past are allowed. Note also
that  the  reciprocal  feature  between  l
12  is  not  a  likely  coincidence  since  many  other
potential  fields  will  simply  not  produce  this  result.  For  example,  a  Newtonian  potential  would
have Epot12 = -Epot21 in which case l

21  is  not  equal  to  1/l

Obviously,  l
12.  In  the  new  model,  the  potential  energy  measured  by  an
observer  at  r2  is  not  negative  of  that  measured  by  an  observer  at  r1.  The  two  energies  have
different  magnitudes  as  given  by  (20)  and  (23).  These  different  magnitudes  are  such  that  the
reciprocal relation between  l
12 is guaranteed.  Note  also  that  these  different  magnitudes
does not imply any physical inconsistency since each observer measures the energy in reference
to the  energy  level  of  his  frame  of  reference  which  differ  between  r2  and  r1  by  a  factor  of  l
12.
Equation (23) can be deduced from (20) by multiplication with -l
12. The negative sign is due to
the fact that energy is lost in one direction and gained in the other.

21 and  l

l

32

21=l

Note also that if the potential at r2 in reference to r1 is given by Epot21, and the potential at
some other radius  r3  in  reference  to  r1  is  given  by  Epot31,  the  potential  of  r3  in  reference  to  r2  is
always such that l
31. This characteristic can be verified by using (20) once with r1 and r2,
another  time  with  r1  and  r3,  and  a  third  time  with  r3  and  r2.  This  feature  also  has  a  physical
meaning since if an observer at r1 sees the physical processes running two times faster at r2 and
four times faster at r3, then an observer at r2 will see the physical processes at r3 running twice as
fast. Note that Epot31 is not equal to Epot32-Epot21 as in the case of Newtonian mechanics. The correct
31/l
potential should be found from the relation l

21.
Another important feature is that the equipotential surfaces around a spherical mass are
still spheres and the value of the potential depends only on the radius of the sphere in analogy to

Newtonian  potentials.  However,  the  dependence  on  the  radius  is  exponential  in  this  solution
while  the  dependence  is  proportional  to  1/r  in  the  case  of  Newtonian  potentials.  Note  that  the
potential energy as measured by an observer at r2 is bound to a minimum of -mgc2 at r1 = 0. Note
that  the  Newtonian  potential  becomes  negative  infinity  at  r1  =  0,  which  leads  to  some
nonphysical conclusions as discussed later. This difference has large physical implications that
will be discussed in more detail in section IV.

ldF

Finally, note that the field equations in (20) and (23) are conservative and the integration
 over any closed path is equal to zero. This characteristic can be easily proven using the
of 
traditional  graphical  interpretation  used  in  Newtonian  fields  and  in  electromagnetic  fields  and
noticing that to make a closed loop the object has to cross each frame of reference twice, once
with the gravitational force in the same direction as dl and another with the gravitational force in
opposite  direction  to  dl.  Hence,  the  whole  integration  reduces  to  zero.  This  is  an  important
feature  indicating  that  energy  is  conserved  under  this  gravitational  model.  The  energy
conservation will be discussed in more detail in subsection C.

This equation can be proven mathematically using (34) and (35). Note that in the differentiation
with respect to space coordinates, the space dilation factor of l
oa between a and o should be taken
into  account  by  using  dsa  =  dso/l
oa,  where  dsa  is  the  distance  at  a  and  dso  is  the  distance  at  o.
However, (36) has also a physical meaning. In the reference frame of mg, the object sees a space
dilation  as  compared  to  an  observer  at  o  given  by  l
oa.  This  space  dilation  causes  a  quadratic
scaling of the gravitational force by a factor of l
2. Hence, the solution in (36) has the traditional
Newton's force multiplied by l

2 represented by the exponential.

relative to his frame of reference.

C.  Energy Conservation and Relation to Special Relativity

Consider  the  two  mass  problem  shown  in  Fig.  5.  An  object  of  mass  mg  is  moved  from  a
distance  r1  to  a  larger  distance  r2  in  the  gravitational  field  of  another  mass  Mg.  The  object
acquires  potential  energy  and  is  at  rest  at  r2.  If  the  object  is  left  to  fall  freely  under  gravity,  it
gains kinetic energy (represented by speed  and motion) while falling to lower potential energy
regions.  The  total  energy  should  remain  constant  as  required  by  energy  conservation,  which
means that the potential energy lost should be exactly equal to the kinetic energy gained by mg.
Hence, if an observer at r1 calculates the potential energy gained by the body when moving to r2
in his frame of reference and observes the speed of the body when it falls back to r1, the observer
can find out the form of the kinetic energy conserved by the given potential field. To illustrate
this  process,  assume  mg  is  moving  in  a  Newtonian  gravitational  field.  The  potential  energy
gained by mg as seen by the observer at r1, is given by

Substituting  the  factor

  from  (39)  into  (37)  the  potential  energy  which  is

transformed into kinetic energy is given by

Of course, this formula is well known and can be derived in other ways completely independent
from  the  Newtonian  gravitational  potential.  However,  if  someone  does  not  know  what  is  the
form  of  the  kinetic  conserved  by  a  Newtonian  gravitational  potential,  he  can  conclude  it  as
described above.

The  same  procedure  is  applied  here  to  find  out  the  form  of  kinetic  energy  that  is
conserved by the gravitational model introduced here. The potential energy gained by mg when
moved from r1 to r2 in the reference frame of an observer at r1 is given by

To find out the speed when the object falls from r2 to r1, it is easier to perform this task in the
reference frame of r2 since the moving object maintains the same energy level as that at r2 due to
the conservation of energy. Maintaining the same energy level as r2 implies that the moving body
maintains the same inertial mass (mg in the reference frame of r2) and space dilation (see section
II) and hence sees the same forces as an observer at r2. Hence, the speed of the moving body can
be calculated from

from  r2  to  r1.  The  extra  exponential  on  the  left  hand  side  is  because  an  observer  at  r1  sees  the
inertial mass of the moving object greater than the mg he measures by l
21 since the moving object
conserves the energy level at r2 during its gravitational free fall. The right hand side represents
the force as seen by an observer at r1 divided by l
21 since the moving body sees a space dilation
as that of an observer at r2 relative to r1. The resulting speed is again given by (43).

Note that this speed cannot exceed the speed of light which means that gravitation cannot
accelerate  (or  decelerate)  an  object  to  more  than  the  speed  of  light.  The  speed  of  light  occurs
only at r1 = 0, which requires that the whole of Mg is located inside a zero radius sphere implying
an infinite density. This conclusion has significant physical implications but will be discussed in
more details in section IV.

To continue the procedure of determining what type of kinetic energy is conserved by the
gravitational  model  introduced  here,  note  that  the  exponential  in  (41)  can  be  determined  from
(43) as

The two above equations are the well-known equations describing the time dilation and kinetic
energy  in  the  special  relativity  theory.  This  result  is  a  very  strong  evidence  in  favor  of  the
gravitational model introduced here since the reader can easily verify that special relativity was
not used anywhere in the derivation of the model. Hence, this gravitational model conserves the
relativistic  kinetic  energy  instead  of  the  classical  kinetic  energy  conserved  by  Newtonian
gravitational fields. Also, note that the time dilation of the moving object relative to any observer
in another reference frame remains the same during a gravitational free fall. This fact is implied
by (45). An observer on the moving object will measure his time to be faster than the time at r1
when the object is at rest at r2 due to the higher potential. As the body starts to moves towards r1,
the observer on the moving object will have two opposite effects on time. He will feel that his

time is losing speed relative to time at r1 due to moving to a lower potential. However, due to its
motion  at  increasing  speed,  the  observer  on  the  moving  object  will  feel  that  the  time  at  r1  is
slowing  down.  This  two  opposite  effects  exactly  cancel  each  other.  (45)  illustrates  that  the
moving  observer will see the time  at  r1  when  he  reaches  r1  to  run  slower  due  to  its  motion  by
exactly the same amount he was seeing the time slower at r1 when the object was stationary at r2.
Hence, a general rule can be made that an object moves under gravitational forces such that it
maintains its time frame and hence, its view of the world in terms of relative times at different
potentials remains the same.

D.  General Equations of Motion in Gravitational Fields

Consider a set of n masses M1-Mn in motion under their gravitational field with certain
distribution  in  space.  The  objective  of  this  section  is  to  determine  the  general  equations
governing the motion of an object Mgj at any instant of time t, determining its position and speed
given the positions and speeds of the ensemble of masses at any instant of time t0. To accomplish
this goal, an observation point (or frame) has to be chosen since in general, observers at different
frames measure different speeds of the masses. Hence, the image is rather like Fig. 7 but with the
masses  in  motion  and  the  general  equation  sought  is  the  same  as  (36)  but  with  moving  rather
than stationary masses.

calculating the force on Mgi. There are two sources of space dilation, one due to the motion of Mgj
relative to O and the other due to the potential difference between Mgj and O.

Refer to Fig. 8, which represents the effective distance between the two masses Mgj and
Mgi as seen by an observer O when calculating the force on Mgi. There are two sources of space
dilation, one due to the motion of Mgj relative to O and the other due to the potential difference
between Mgj and O. The object Mgj moves by a speed vj. The object Mgj sees the force between
itself and any other object Mi as given by Newton's law of gravitation without any modification
as discussed before. This force depends on the distance between the two masses in their frame of
reference  rji  which  is  decomposed  into  two  components,  one  in  the  direction  of  motion  and  is
denoted rv and the other in the normal plane and is denoted rn. These components are given by

From the point of view of O, the space appears shrunk in the direction of motion of Mgj
and hence the distance felt by Mgj appears larger in the frame of reference of O as shown in Fig.
8. The normal distance to motion appear the same [1]. Hence, the effective distance observed by
O is denoted by rji_m where the extra suffix m stands for motion since the space dilation is due to
motion. Referring to Fig. 8, rji_m is given by

since the inertial mass of Mgj in the reference frame of O is higher due to the kinetic energy of Mj
and also scales by l

where vj is given by drj/dt and rji_m is given by (48). If all the other masses are stationary, this
second order vector differential equation describes the motion of Mj given the initial speed and
position of Mj. The variable solved for in the equation is rj(t) which represents the motion of Mj
as observed from O. In the case when all the n masses are in motion, the motion of the whole
system can be determined by solving n coupled differential equations as given by (55) with j = 1
to  n.  The  n  variables  solved  for  are  r1  to  rn.  Hence,  if  the  speeds  and  positions  of  all  the
interacting masses in a  certain system (such as the  solar  system)  are  recorder  at  any  instant  of
time t0 as seen from some observation point (such as the earth or a satellite), the motion of the
system as viewed from O can be completely determined.

To illustrate the use of this equation, consider the two mass problem shown in Fig. 5. An
object of mass mg is at rest at r2 and falls under gravity to a smaller distance r1 from another mass
Mg. An observer at distance rO determines the motion of mg according to his frame of reference.

This relation illustrates again the conservation of the relativistic energy under this gravitational
model. Equation (57) deserves some investigation. If rO is chosen to be r1, (57) becomes (43) as
expected, and the maximum speed of the falling object in this frame is c in the limiting case as
explained  before.  If  the  observation  is  made  from  rO  =  r2,  and  r1  is  zero,  the  speed  that  the

3=
2

observer at r2 sees when mg reaches r1 is 

v

c

. It can be verified that for any r2, r1, and rO, the

maximum  speed  that  can  be  observed  from  any  frame  of  reference  is  c  when  r1  =  0  and  the
observation is made from r1. This is an important result since it indicates that celestial objects can
never be observed to travel at a speed higher than light if the only force acting on them is gravity
(which is a reasonable  assumption). This result agrees with  observations,  since  it  has  not  been
recorded  yet  that  a  celestial  object  was  observed  to  travel  at  a  speed  higher  than  that  of  light.
Note that this result is not as trivial as it may appear since the speed of light is faster at higher
potential regions. Hence, an observer at a lower potential can see an object traveling at a speed
higher  than  the  speed  of  light  in  the  observers  frame  of  reference  if  the  object  is  at  a  higher
potential region. It is just that gravity will not do it. If a rocket carries some strong fuel that can
accelerate  it  to  very  high  speeds  close  to  that  of  light  in  its  frame  of  reference,  it  will  be
measured to travel faster than light if observed from regions where the speed of light is slower.

A  final  observation  is  that  gravity  cannot  accelerate  or  decelerate  an  object  travelling
with  the  speed  of  light  in  the  direction  of  its  motion.  This  fact  is  due  to  the  motional  space
dilation  discussed  when  driving  the  equations  of  motion  in  this  section.  This  space  dilation
becomes infinite when the object travels at the speed of light making objects infinitely far away
in the direction of motion and eliminating any gravitational effect (and actually any other effect).
However, objects travelling at the speed of light can be accelerated or decelerated by gravity in
the  direction  perpendicular  to  their  motion.  That  is  why  light  never  changes  its  speed  in  the
direction  of  motion  but  can  bend  under  gravity  and  any  observer  measuring  the  speed  of  light
will find it constant at c in his frame of reference.

IV. Physical Implications

The  physical  implications  of  this  new  model  can  hardly  be  overstated.  Already,  many
new concepts have been introduced throughout the paper. These concepts are elaborated in this
section  and  other  physical  implications  are  also  discussed.  This  section  is  not  intended  as  a
comprehensive  analysis  of  the  physical  impact  of  the  new  model.  Rather,  this  section  briefly
points out some of the most significant implications of the new model and how the new concepts
agree  with  physical  intuition  and  observational  facts.  Hence,  this  section  should  serve  as
providing a set of evidences in  favor  of  this  theory  as  well  as  a  pointer  to  interesting  research
areas that are motivated by the new theory.

The section is arranged as follows. In subsection A, it is shown that this model removes
all  the  mathematical  and  physical  infinities  that  can  arise  in  general  relativity  and  Newtonian
mechanics. In subsection B, Feynman's great mystery is shown to flow naturally out of the new
model and it is shown that the physical meaning of this mystery is that the gravitational potential
energy is the source of all other known forces including the electromagnetic forces. In subsection
C,  the  unmistakable  signs  of  the  compatibility  of  this  model  with  quantum  mechanics  are
discussed. In fact, it is shown that the essence of quantum mechanical behavior is gravitational
and  that  electrons  are  real  black  holes.  Finally,  exciting  possibilities  for  the  dark  matter
constituting the majority of the mass (gravitational) in the universe are discussed in subsection
D.

A.  Removing the Infinities in General Relativity and Newtonian Mechanics

The theory of general relativity has several infinities that arise in special cases of very
strong gravity and lead to many mathematical and physical puzzles. These infinities have been
taken by many highly respected scientists (including Einstein himself) as signs of serious flows
in the theory [5], [8]. The first physical inconsistency is that the theory of general relativity leads
to solutions where time can become imaginary such as in the interior of a black hole where all
mathematics break. It was shown that according to the new theory the gravitational time dilation
is  given  by  exponential  functions  (e.g.,  see  (32)).  Hence,  the  value  of  time  dilation  is  always
positive and cannot be imaginary or negative.

Another  dilemma  that  general  relativity  leads  to  is  that  gravitational  forces  can
accelerate  or  decelerate  an  object  to  higher  than  the  speed  of  light  even  with  finite  mass
densities.  This  problem  is  also  related  to  black  holes.  Since  the  body  can  exceed  the  speed  of
light, time dilation again can become imaginary. According to the theory of special relativity, an
infinite  amount  of  energy  is  required  to  reach  the  speed  of  light.  Where  did  the  gravitational
force  get  this  infinite  amount  of  energy  from?  A  question  with  no  convincing  answers.  The
traditional argument is that the time stops at the event horizon of the black hole and hence, the
event  never  really  happens.  This  argument  is  extremely  wrong  but  its  explanation  will  be
postponed until subsection C where evidence is given against this argument. For now, a simple
counter argument is that from the point of view of a far observer, the energy is not conserved if
the object stops at the edge of a black hole. The object starts having potential energy  and as it
falls  into  the  black  hole,  the  potential  energy  is  transformed  into  kinetic  energy.  Hence,  a  far
observer should see the object continuously accelerating as it falls into the black hole since the
potential  decreases  as  the  object  approaches  the  hole.  But  if  the  object  stops,  this  means  that
somehow the potential energy evaporated from the point of view of the far observer. Also, this
means that the observer will see gravity doing a very weird thing. He will see the gravity first
accelerating the object towards the black hole and then decelerating it as it comes closer until the

23

object  stops.  From  his  frame  of  reference,  the  observer  will  perceive  gravity  as  exerting  a
repulsive force on the moving object. Besides these mathematical and physical inconsistencies,
many philosophical dilemmas arise when trying to figure out what happens inside a black hole.
So, in short, black holes as they are described by the theory of general relativity are one of the
greatest puzzles of science and have lead to a huge amount of confusion and dispute.

In the new theory, it was shown that the gravity can never accelerate or decelerate any
object to higher than the speed of light according to (43). An object can be accelerated to exactly
the speed of light if there is an infinite mass density at some region of space where all the mass is
concentrated  in  zero  radius.  Still,  time  can  never  get  imaginary  under  the  gravitational  model,
even at the speed of light. An alternative way to state this characteristic is that light can escape
any  object of finite mass density. Hence, under this  new  theory,  black  holes  cannot  be  objects
with finite densities. This characteristic eliminates all the puzzles associated with black holes and
the possibility of travelling to higher than the speed of light under gravitational forces.

It  is  interesting  to  notice  the  behavior  of  the  scientific  community  in  relation  to  black
holes. By their definition, black holes cannot emit energy or electromagnetic radiation (including
light) [9]-[11]. However, when non-visible objects were discovered by their influence on other
visible stars, they were found to emit large amounts of X and gamma radiation in direct violation
of the definition of a black hole. The estimated mass of these objects (based on their effects on
the other stars) exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit [9]. According to general relativity, if any object
exceeds this limit, it has to behave as a black hole and emit no radiation. Hence, the scientific
community was faced with this obvious contradiction between general relativity predictions and
observations.  Instead  of  questioning  general  relativity,  complex  theories  were  developed  to
account for this radiation [5]. Hence, more complexities are added to an already complex model.
The  patching  process  of  theories  whenever  they  fail  is  always  a  sign  that  there  is  something
wrong.

According to  the  theory  introduced  here,  these  observations  are  understandable.  These
alleged black holes are objects of extremely high but finite density, which means that they can
never trap light and will radiate. There  are two opposing effects as an object collapses to such
large densities. The radiation from such an object is red shifted due to its high gravity but also
the radiation itself is at very high frequency due to the extreme density of the matter inside such
an object. Hence, if the increase of the radiation frequency due to higher density is faster than the
decrease in frequency due to the red shift, denser objects will radiate at higher frequencies. There
is evidence that neutron stars radiate at higher frequencies than normal stars which supports the
above assumption. Hence,  there  are  no  puzzles  under  the  new  gravitational  model.  These  dark
objects are normal stars that radiate at the X and gamma frequency ranges and hence these stars
are not visible in the red to blue frequencies.

Note that  it  is  not  claimed  here  that  the  above  description  is  a  theory.  This  discussion
just  points  out  that  there  may  be  much  simpler  and  physically  intuitive  explanations  for  these
objects  under  the  new  theory.  Also,  note  that  it  is  not  claimed  that  black  holes  do  not  exist.
Actually, they do exist, but in the most unexpected manner and are the most unexpected objects
as will be discussed in subsection C. The behavior of these black holes is however very different
from the behavior of traditional black holes and leads to no puzzles.

Another  serious  infinity  that  arises  in  the  general  relativity  theory  and  Newtonian
mechanics, is that the potential energy of an object in reference to r = 0 is infinite. That is why
the  potential  energy  reference  is  always  taken  at  infinity  in  these  theories.  However,  the

24

physically meaningful potential energy is the one referred to r = 0. This topic will be discussed in
the next section.

B.  Feynman's Great Mystery

As mentioned in the introduction, Feynman among many others [4], [5] has pointed out
the equivalence between the total potential energy of the universe and the rest energy given by
Mc2  with  M  as  the  total  mass  of  the  universe.  This  observation  cannot  be  explained  using  the
general  relativity  theory  or  Newtonian  mechanics.  To  show  why  this  is  so,  first  the  correct
potential energy reference should be defined. Consider again the potential energy of a mass mg in
the gravitational field of another mass Mg. As long as there is nonzero distance between the two
objects, the objects still have potential energy since they can still move and fall on each other if
left on their own. If the objects have nonzero radius and touch each other, the potential energy
appears as pressure between the two objects. Hence, the objects have some energy to use unless
the  two  objects  are  stationary  at  zero  distance  from  each  other.  That  is  why  the  real  potential
energy  should  be  calculated  in  reference  to  r  =  0  between  the  two  objects  where  the  potential
energy  is  really  zero  and  there  is  no  more  energy  to  spend.  If  this  is  attempted  in  Newtonian
mechanics, the potential energy of any body is infinite since the Newtonian potential is given by

Hence, a body has to lose an infinite amount of energy to reach ra = 0, although the total energy
of the object is given by mgc2. Even at a finite ra, a body can lose more than its total energy as it
falls from rb to ra. The condition is very similar to the condition for having a black hole, namely

The  same  behavior  occurs  in  general  relativity.  This  behavior  proves  non-physical  and  very
problematic  when  dealing  with  elementary  point  particles  such  as  photons  and  electrons  in
quantum  mechanics.  Also,  this  behavior  is  not  compatible  with  theories  that  assume  that  the
space is filled with particles and antiparticles since this would imply infinite energy [5].

However, the total potential energy in the universe was calculated by many scientists in
reference to r = 0. The idea is to model the universe as a sphere with uniform density. Under this
model, Newton's law allows the calculation of the potential energy of the mass in the sphere in
reference  to  r  =  0,  which  represents  the  real  potential  energy.  Performing  this  task  requires
calculating  a  double  integral  using  Newton's  law.  This  calculation  has  been  repeated  several
times  using  the  best  known  estimates  of  the  universe  size  and  density  only  to  confirm  more
accurately the relation between the rest mass and potential energy of the universe. This is now a
well-accepted fact but with no viable explanation.

To illustrate how the new model naturally supports this fact, consider again the potential
energy of  a mass  mg in the gravitational field of  another mass  Mg.  The equation describing the
potential energy lost when moving mg from a larger radius rb to a smaller one  ra as seen  by  an
observer at rb was shown in section III to be given by

It is trivial to check that an observer at rb will see that mg lost exactly its whole energy given by
mgc2 as it falls to ra = 0. Note that Mg also loses its whole energy in this process since from its
perspective it has fell to ra = 0 in the field of mg. Hence, the total potential energy of the system
of masses is equal to the total rest energy of the masses. Note that mg and Mg will also lose all
their energy if brought in rest to zero distance even if there are other masses in the universe. This
can be easily checked form the multiple mass potential energy equation given by

as  described  in  section  III.  Hence,  if  a  particle  or  mass  is  forced  to  zero  distance  at  rest  from
another particle or mass, both masses lose their full potential energy. It can be also easily verified
that if the whole universe is brought in rest to zero radius, the universe losses all its rest energy.
This discussion clearly shows that it is inherent in the new gravitational model that the potential
energy  of  any  system  of  particles  or  masses  is  equal  to  their  rest  energy.  Note  that  it  is  not
required here to model the universe as a sphere of uniform density. The universe can be made of
arbitrary  discrete  and  uniform  mass  distributions  and  the  equivalence  between  the  potential
energy and rest energy still holds.

So far, what was shown is that Feynman's great mystery is supported by the mathematics
of the theory introduced here. But what is the physical interpretation of this fact. To clarify this
point, the hydrogen atom behavior in a gravitational field, which initiated this whole theory, is
examined again. By referring to Bohr's model, as a hydrogen atom approaches a mass, it losses
potential energy. As discussed in section II, losing this energy means less electron mass, which
in  turn  results  in  expanding  the  orbit  of  the  electron  around  the  nucleus  according  to  Bohr's
equations. This size expansion is canceled by an  equivalent space dilation as discussed before.
Hence, the net result that an observer at higher  potential  will  see  is  that  as  the  hydrogen  atom
moves towards the other mass, it keeps its size, but all the forces become weaker which results in
slowing  all  the  physical  processes  relative  to  the  higher  observer.  As  the  hydrogen  atom
approaches r = 0, it losses all the forces and energies within it from the perspective of the higher
observer. Hence, a statement can be made here that all the energy in the universe is gravitational
potential  energy  and  this  energy  translates  into  all  other  types  of  energies  such  as
electromagnetic energy and atomic binding energy. Hence, the potential energy of any individual
body in the universe is equal to the rest energy of that body. This rest energy represents all the
internal forces and energies within that body. Hence, gravitation is the source of all other forces.
Also,  gravitational  mass  is  the  essential  characteristic  that  any  particle  has  to  have  to  exist.
Particles can have no charge or no rest mass, but always have to have a gravitational mass. As far
as the author knows, there is no known particle that is not affected by gravity.

C.  Relations to Quantum Mechanical Behavior

The  gravitational  theory  introduced  here  agrees  with  the  well-known  quantum
mechanical  concepts  and  facts.  Actually,  it  is  shown  in  this  section  that  gravity  is  the  force
governing  the  quantum  mechanical  behavior  of  elementary  particles.  To  start  this  discussion,

consider bringing two particles together somehow to rest at zero distance. Theoretically, this is
not  impossible  since  unlike  Newtonian  mechanics  and  general  relativity,  this  process  does  not
require infinite energy in the new theory. This process requires energy equal to the rest energies
of  the  two  particles.  As  discussed  in  the  previous  section  the  two  particles  lose  all  their  rest
energy  as  the  particles  reach  zero  distance  from  each  other.  Assume  that  each  particle  has  a
gravitational  mass  of  mg/2.  This  particle  will  have  a  gravitational  mass  of  mg  since  the
gravitational mass is always  conserved.  However,  the  rest  inertial  mass  of  this  particle  will  be
zero1.  Hence,  under  the  slightest  gravitational  force,  this  particle  will  experience  infinite
acceleration  since  its  inertial  mass  is  zero  while  its  gravitational  mass  is  finite.  This  finite
gravitational mass results in a gravitational force on a particle that has no resistance to motion.
As the velocity of this particle increases, its inertial mass changes according to the formula

(63)

The inertial mass will remain zero at all speeds except at the speed of light c, in which case the
value minertial becomes undetermined and can be nonzero. The gravitational theory introduced here
cannot predict what will minertial be at the speed of light and extra information about the physical
nature of the problem and the energy exchange involved is needed to determine the inertial mass.
Also, once the particle reaches the speed of light, it cannot be accelerated further in the direction
of its motion by any force. This is due to the motion space dilation discussed in section III D,
which makes all the objects in the direction of  motion  look  infinitely  far  and  hence  exert  zero
force on the moving body.

The gravitational theory introduced here predicts many interesting characteristics for this
particle. This particle is a point particle with no dimensions (zero radius) and has to travel at the
speed of light as long as there is gravity. Even if the particle can be put to halt by an infinitely
accurate  gravitational  equilibrium  condition,  this  condition  is  unstable,  and  the  slightest
fluctuation will cause this particle to fly at the speed of light. The time it takes this particle to go
from rest to the speed of light is zero due to the infinite acceleration. Hence, such a particle can
only be found running at the speed of light and is a point particle. This description perfectly fits
the  behavior  of  a  photon.  Hence,  starting  from  the  gravitational  theory,  we  can  predict  the
existence of photons. As for the inertial mass of a photon at the speed of light, it is well known
from quantum mechanics to be equal to hf/c2 for a photon of frequency f. The gravitational mass
of a photon is an open question, but it has to be proportional to frequency if all light bends by the
same amount under gravitation, which requires a constant ratio of gravitational and inertial mass
at  all  frequencies.  Together  with  the  zero  rest  mass  property  and  the  zero  dimension  property,
these set of parameters completely determines the behavior of any photon.

Another interesting conclusion can be made by trying to answer the question of what are
the characteristics of a particle that can trap a photon based on the new gravitational theory. As
discussed before, an object going at the speed of light can escape any object, except if the object

                                                
1 Note that the fact that the gravitational mass and the inertial mass of a particle are not equal does not contradict the
conclusions  made  in  section  II  C.  The  difference  between  these  masses  is  because  they  are  observed  by  a  far
observer who is in a different frame of reference. To measure the inertial mass of a point particle, the observer has to
reach it first. As the observer and his tools approach the particle, they lose all their energy and the rest mass will be
measured the same as the gravitational mass rather than zero.

has zero radius. In that case, if a photon falls into that object, it cannot escape, since the photon
falls on it with the speed of light which is exactly the speed of escape. In fact, it is more accurate
to say that that it is  undetermined  if  the  photon  will  be  trapped  or  not  by  this  object  since  the
speed of light is exactly equal to the escape speed from this object. In any case, an object that can
trap a photon has one definite characteristic. It has to be a point particle with zero dimensions
according  to  the  new  gravitational  theory.  In  effect,  the  object  should  be  a  black  hole  to  trap
light. But what object  traps  photons.  It  is  the  electron.  Hence,  this  theory  also  predicts  that  an
electron has to be a point particle with zero dimensions. No wonder all the experiments made to
measure  the  radius  of  an  electron  or  a  photon  failed  [5].  It  is  now  a  well-accepted  fact  of
quantum  mechanics  that  photons  and  electrons  are  point  particles  [5].  Note  that  according  to
general  relativity,  an  electron  is  not  required  to  be  of  zero  dimensions  to  trap  light  since  the
theory  of  general  relativity  allows  black  holes  of  nonzero  dimensions.  This  can  be  counted  as
another evidence in favor of the new theory. Note also that any element with a finite radius, such
as  protons,  cannot  absorb  photons  according  to  the  theory  introduced  here,  which  agrees  with
quantum mechanical observational facts. It is interesting that the black hole theory can be tested
on electrons.

As aforementioned, it is undetermined whether  a photon falling on an electron will  be
trapped  or  not  since  the  speed  of  the  photon  is  exactly  equal  to  the  escape  speed  form  the
electron. If the escape speed from a black hole were just a little larger than that of light, then any
photon falling onto any electron would be trapped. It is well known that this is not how electrons
and photons interact. In some cases an electron traps a photon and in the over whelming majority
of cases the photon escapes. The conditions that determine if a photon is trapped or not requires
further investigations. However, the  new theory introduced  here  allows  both  cases.  Note  again
that general relativity would predict that any electron would trap any photon since a black hole in
general  relativity  have  regions  beyond  the  event  horizon  where  the  escape  velocity  has  to  be
greater than that of light.

Another question is how does a photon fall into and escape from an electron. According
to the theory of general relativity, the time stops at the event horizon. Hence, a far observer can
never see the event of the photon falling into the black hole. This argument is an example of the
confused  statements  made  to  circumvent  the  puzzles  created  by  general  relativity.  If  that  were
true, then how do we experience electrons absorbing and emitting photons all the time. Note that
according to the theory introduce here, a far observer will see the photon hitting the electron at a

3
2

speed  slightly  less  than  the  speed  of  light  (such  as 

c

)  while  an  observer  very  close  to  the

electron will see the photon hitting the electron at almost the speed of light (see section III D).
Thus, in the new theory there are no issues and photons can be absorbed an emitted by electrons.
The confusion arises from making arbitrary statements such as "time stops". Time does not really
stop. All that happens is that if an experiment is performed at a high potential frame of reference
and repeated at a lower potential frame of reference, an observer at some stationary position will
see  the  experiment  at  the  lower  potential  run  slower.  This  phenomenon  is  due  to  the  fact  that
there is less energy at the lower potential frame of reference, which scales all the physical forces
down  and  slows  the  experiment  as  discussed  in  section  II.  However,  a  photon  falling  into  an
electron (or a black hole) crosses many equipotential surfaces and carries much higher energies
than the low gravitational potential frames close to the electron. Hence, the rules of time dilation

28

do not apply to such an object. The fact that electrons and photons interact all the time represents
another evidence in favor of the new theory over general relativity.

Also,  another  consistency  between  quantum  mechanical  observations  and  the  theory
introduced here is the quantum leaps an electron makes between different orbits of an atom. It is
well-known that an electron bound to an atom does not move in a continuous manner between
orbits. It rather changes orbits in quantum leaps. This fact can be understood by recalling that a
trapped  photon  moving  under  the  speed  of  light,  once  released  will  experience  infinite
acceleration  to  the  speed  of  light.  Hence,  the  photon's  energy  changes  from  zero  to  hf  in  zero
time. The initial zero energy of a photon is due to its zero inertial mass below the speed of light
as discussed before. This violent change of energy and speed results in an infinite force, which
by  Newton's  third  law,  results  in  an  infinite  reaction  force  on  the  electron  until  the  electron
reaches  the  other  orbit.  Hence,  if  both  momentum  and  energy  conservation  are  considered
together  under  the  new  theory,  the  quantum  leaps  of  an  electron  between  atom  orbits  can  be
easily understood.

Therefore,  it  was  illustrated  in  this  section  that  the  force  governing  the  behavior  of
photons and the interaction between photons and electrons is gravity. At a first glance, this fact
may  appear  amazing.  Yet  once  the  facts  are  put  together,  it  just  appears  natural.  After  all,  a
photon is only affected by gravity and mechanical collisions. Electromagnetic forces for example
have  no  effect  on  photons  since  photons  carry  no  charge.  Hence,  it  only  seems  natural  that
gravity  determines  the  behavior  of  photons.  This  fact  may  appear  amazing  however  from  the
perspective  of  the  quantum  mechanical  community,  since  it  is  traditionally  believed  that
quantum mechanics and gravitation does not match. But they do. It is general relativity that does
not  match  quantum  mechanics  because  of  its  flaws.  Also,  quantum  mechanics  is  usually
classified as relativistic and non-relativistic. According to this discussion, quantum mechanics in
all its forms is just extreme relativity. The link is essential. This section just points out some of
the  remarkable  agreements  between  the  new  theory  of  gravitation  and  quantum  mechanics.
Significant  more  research  is  required  to  fully  unify  the  two  theories.  This  new  work  on
gravitation can be a milestone in unifying the two theories. The author believes that the way to
better  understand  quantum  mechanics  is  to  follow  the  link  between  gravitation  (relativity)  and
quantum mechanics.

D.  Dark Matter

Another  exciting  possibility  arises  from  the  gravitational  theory  introduced  here.
Following the same logic as in subsection C, a particle can exist with zero rest mass and finite
gravitational  mass.  Hence,  this  particle  has  to  travel  at  the  speed  of  light.  However,  such  a
particle,  in  general,  is  not  required  to  have  a  nonzero  inertial  mass  at  the  speed  of  light.  The
inertial mass according to (63) is undetermined at the speed of light and can be anything. Once
the  particle  reaches  the  speed  of  light,  it  cannot  be  accelerated  further  in  the  direction  of  its
motion by any force. This is due to the motion space dilation discussed in section III D, which
makes all the objects in the direction of motion look infinitely far and hence exert zero force on
the moving body. So we can assume that, unlike photons, these particles have zero inertial mass
at the speed of light. If such particles exist, there will be absolutely no way to detect them except
by their gravitational effects. These particles carry no energy to radiate and carry no momentum.
So,  if  such  a  particle  hits  you,  you  will  feel  absolutely  nothing.  Also,  if  these  particles  are
uniformly distributed across the space, their direct effect on a moving rocket for example is zero
since  the  net  force  is  zero.  However,  the  existence  of  these  particles  in  a  sphere  would  exert

29

significant gravitational force on objects outside the sphere. So, if we consider ourselves at the
center of the universe, we will feel no significant gravitational effects due to this black matter.
However,  we  will  see  the  far  away  galaxies  accelerating  or  decelerating  at  a  different  rate  as
compared to the case when this black matter is nonexistent. The difference depends on the ratio
of  normal  matter  (with  energy)  to  these  particles.  Note  also  that  a  very  small  density  of  these
particles  in  space  can  make  a  huge  difference  at  the  cosmological  level  due  to  the  vast  space
between galaxies. Due to this very small density, the effects of such particles on small structures
like the solar system can be negligible. These particles can be called pure gravitational particles
PGPs  since  these  particles  are  just  pure  gravitation.  All  these  effects  agree  perfectly  with  the
observed  but unexplained effects of the  so-called  dark  matter.  Note  that  under  the  principle  of
equivalence,  such  particles  cannot  exist  since  they  should  have  energy  proportional  to  their
gravitational  mass.  If  these  particles  have  energy,  they  cannot  be  running  around  us  with  the
speed of light without being detected. Hence, the theory introduced here opens the door for many
possible  new  explanations  of  the  universe  around  us  starting  form  the  smallest  particles  to  the
acceleration rates of galaxies.

V. Where Did General Relativity Go Wrong

The answer to this question is clear from the previous discussion. The general relativity
depends  fundamentally  on  the  equivalence  principal  between  the  inertial  and  gravitational
masses.  It  was  shown  in  this  paper  that  this  is  not  true.  It  is  only  true  if  an  experiment  and
observations  are  made  in  the  same  frame  of  reference  but  is  not  true  when  observations  to  an
experiment are made from a different frame of reference. But why does general relativity appear
to work in some cases such as the calculation of Mercury's orbit and calculating the time dilation
of  a  satellite.  The  answer  is  that  general  relativity  works  at  low  gravity  but  fails  at  strong
gravitation [8]. Intuitively, if the gravity is weak, assuming that the gravitational mass is equal to
the inertial mass is valid as a first order approximation. Note that what happens when moving an
object from a lower potential to a higher potential is that the gravitational mass remains constant
while  the  inertial  mass  increases  by  an  amount  equal  to  the  potential  energy  over  c2.  If  the
gravitation is low, the difference can be neglected. This fact can be illustrated using a specific
example. Consider a mass mg that is moved from a distance r1 from earth to a higher distance r2.
Since the earth gravitation is weak, Newton's law can be used as a good approximation. In that
case the potential energy difference is given by

Hence, according to the theory introduced here, the time dilation between r1 and r2 is given by

According  to  the  principle  of  equivalence,  acceleration  is  equivalent  to  gravitation.  Hence,  a
body accelerated by the same acceleration as the gravity of the earth between r1 and r2, reaches a
velocity given by

The time dilations according to the theory introduced here and according to general relativity are
approximately the same when the potential energy is small as compared to the rest energy of the
body but are completely different when these two energies become comparable. This fact can be
easily  verified  by  expanding  the  square  root  in  (68)  into  a  series.  Hence,  general  relativity
appears to make reasonable predictions at low gravitation but fails at extreme gravity, such as in
the case of black holes and point particles in quantum mechanics.

There are two major mistakes in deriving the theory of general relativity. First, a special
case  (special  relativity)  was  used  to  derive  a  general  case,  which  is  always  an  unreliable  way
when developing theories. In the work described in this paper, the general theory of gravitation
was derived first and the special theory followed naturally from it as described in section III C.
The other mistake is that the link between special relativity and general relativity was taken to be
acceleration. It can be shown that the real link is energy not acceleration. For example, the time
dilation formula in special relativity can be put as

Note  that  the  formula  of  time  dilation  is  exactly  the  same  in  terms  of  energy  both  in  the
gravitational  theory  introduced  here  and  in  special  relativity.  Hence,  the  link  is  energy  not
acceleration.  Note  that  energy  is  by  nature  a  relative  quantity.  An  absolute  value  of  energy  is
meaningless. Only the relative values of energy are important and energy has to be measured in
reference to another energy level. It is this relativity of energy that underlies the special relativity
in case of kinetic energy and as shown here gravitational relativity based on the potential energy.
Hence, the fact that the correct link is energy is physically intuitive. The subtle mistake of using
acceleration  instead  of  energy  as  the  link  between  special  and  general  relativity,  confused  the
world for almost one hundred years and prevented the unification of gravitation with other forces
and quantum mechanics.

VI. Conclusions

A  new  relativistic  gravitational  model  has  been  introduced  in  this  paper.  Many
evidences were provided that support this model such as: the model's self consistency, reduction
to Newton's law at low gravitation, removing the infinities in general relativity, special relativity
theory  deduction  from  the  new  model,  remarkable  agreement  with  quantum  mechanics,  and
explaining  Feynman's  great  mystery.  The  model  was  not  derived  by  collecting  this  set  of
observations and requirements and trying to fit a theory to them. Rather, the model was derived
from a completely different perspective by examining the behavior of an atom in a gravitational
field and maintaining energy conservation and the principle of relativity. The agreement of the
model  developed  here  with  all  the  known  requirements  of  a  correct  gravitational  model  and
observational  facts  is  a  strong  evidence  in  favor  of  the  new  theory.  The  agreement  was  not
forced.  Also,  it  was  pointed  out  where  general  relativity  went  wrong  and  that  the  principle  of
equivalence was fundamentally wrong.

Many  serious  physical  implications  follow  from  the  new  gravitational  model.  One
implication is that a black hole as defined and characterized by general relativity is wrong. Only
an object of infinite density (a point object) can trap light. Also, it was shown that under the new
theory  an  object  cannot  be  accelerated  to  higher  than  the  speed  of  light  by  gravity  which  is
physically intuitive and in agreement  with special relativity. It is also shown that time  dilation
under the new theory has to be positive and cannot be negative or imaginary. The speed of light
limit and positive time dilation characteristics seem to be strict rules of physics. Feynman's great
mystery  was  shown  to  be  in  absolute  agreement  with  the  new  theory  and  has  a  significant
physical  meaning.  The  equivalence  between  the  rest  energy  and  gravitational  potential  energy
means that gravitational potential energy is the source of all energies and forces in the universe.
This potential energy simply translates to other forces and fields as discussed in section II.

However, the greatest area to test the new theory is in quantum mechanics and optics. It
was  shown  that  the  force  determining  the  behavior  and  interaction  between  photons  and
electrons is gravity. And not any gravity, it is gravity in its extreme when gravity is so strong to
trap light. It was shown that electrons are real black holes (but charged ones). Two great mergers
between different theories result from this relation. Gravitation and quantum mechanics, which
are  traditionally  thought  of  as  non-compatible  theories,  are  actually  shown  here  to  be
fundamentally  related.  Relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  are  also  shown  to  be  fundamentally
related, with the very basic concepts of quantum mechanics (such as electron-photon interaction)
being extreme relativistic effects. Hence, two important missing links are established by the new
theory. The promise of improved understanding of quantum mechanics and the universe is just
huge.

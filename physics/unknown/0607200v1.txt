OMPACT-SIZE  high-Q  WG  mode  resonators  have  long 
become  essential  components  for  a  variety  of  photonic 
applications 
from  narrow-linewidth  wavelength-
selective  filters  to  low-threshold  semiconductor  microdisk 
lasers  and  to  sensitive  optical  biosensors  [1].  To  enable  stable 
operation  of  microcavity-based  devices  and 
the 
thresholds  of  microcavity  lasers,  cavities  supporting  high-Q 
modes  with  wide  spectral  range  (FSR)  are  required.  The 
technological advances of recent years made possible shrinking 
of  the  microcavity  resonators  to  the  scale  of  the  optical 
wavelength.  This  enables  significant  increasing  of  the  cavity 
FSR  so  that  only  one  mode  is  observed  near  the  peak  of  the 
material  gain  spectrum.  However,  the  WG-mode  Q-factors 
decrease exponentially with decreasing cavity size, and thus the 
demands  for  the  high  working mode Q-factor and a wide FSR

Clearly, new functionalities of optical microcavities could be 
achieved  if  a  general  mechanism  was  established enabling one 
to  split  double-degenerate  WG  modes,  to  suppress  parasitic 
modes,  and 
light  output  from  a 
microcavity.  Some  ways  to  obtain  directional  emission  from 
cavities  with  sizes  much  larger  than  the  optical  wavelength  by 
shape  have  been  previously 
tuning 
demonstrated, both theoretically (by studying the ray dynamics 
in  deformed  microcavities)  and  experimentally 
[2-10]. 
However, it cannot be assumed that the principles of obtaining 
large 
directional 
microcavities will necessarily yield the desired result in the case 
when  the  cavity  size  is  of  the  order  of  the  optical  wavelength. 
Furthermore, as optical effects in such small cavities cannot be

techniques,  tailoring  their  optical  properties  presents  a  design 
challenge,  which  can  only  be  met  by  rigorous  analytical 
techniques and robust numerical modeling.

In  this  paper,  we  formulate  and  test  basic  design  rules  for 
constructing  wavelength-scale  microcavity  structures 
that 
enable both efficient splitting of a double-degenerate mode and 
shaping  of  the  working  mode  emission  pattern.  We  give  an 
overview  of  wavelength-scale  quasi-single-mode  microcavity 
structures with directional emission obtained by using some or 
all  of  these  rules,  discuss  and  compare  cavity  features,  and 
demonstrate ways to tune their characteristics. These structures 
include: microdisk resonators with either global or local contour 
deformations, coupled-cavity clusters (photonic molecules) with 
non-symmetrical  geometries,  and  photonic-crystal-assisted 
microdisk resonators with a preferred direction of light escape. 

II.  METHODOLOGY 

All  the  numerical  results  presented  in  this  paper  have  been 
obtained  with  a  highly  efficient  method  based  on  the  rigorous 
boundary  integral  equation  formulation  and  trigonometric-
trigonometric  Galerkin  discretization  combined  with 
the 
singularity  extraction  procedure.  Here,  we  will  briefly  review 
the basic features of the method and the numerical algorithms;

referred  to  [11].  Among  several  alternative  ways  to  formulate 
the eigenvalue problem for the complex natural frequencies of a 
microcavity in terms of integral equations, we chose the Muller 
boundary integral equations (MBIEs) formulation [12]. Among 
the advantages of MBIEs is a reduced solution domain (only the 
cavity  boundary  is  discretized)  and  absence  of  spurious 
numerical  solutions.  Note,  that  for  a  general  case  of  N 
electromagnetically  coupled  microcavities,  the  integrals  over  a 
contour  of  a  single  cavity  in  [11]  should  be  replaced  with  the 
sums from 1 to N of the integrals over the contours of all the N 
cavities. 

integrals  with 

Next, to obtain a discrete form of MBIEs, we use a spectral 
Galerkin  method  with  the  global  trigonometric  expansion  and 
trial  functions.  This  procedure  yields  small  final  matrices  yet 
logarithmically 
requires  computing  double 
singular kernels. Numerical accuracy of the singular integrals is 
crucial  for  the  algorithm  convergence  rate  and  accuracy, 
especially in the near field computing. To address this problem, 
we use a singularity extraction technique. Each integral operator 
is  decomposed  into  a  sum  of  a  main part given by the explicit 
Fourier  representation,  and  the  remaining  part  with  a  smooth 
kernel that is integrated numerically. The algorithm thus has an 
exponential  convergence  rate  provided  that  the  numerical 
integration can be performed exactly. In the cases where this is 
not  possible,  however,  the  convergence  rate  of  the  fully 
discretized scheme can be progressively improved by increasing 
the  order  of  the  numerical  integration  quadrature.  The  final 
block-matrix equation is of the Fredholm second kind and has a 
small matrix size. 

Complex  eigenfrequencies  of  microcavity  modes  are 
obtained by searching for zeros of the matrix determinant in the 
complex  frequency  plane.  After  the  eigenfrequency  is  found, 
the  matrix  equation  is  solved  to  obtain  the  modal  field 
distribution  at  any  point  in  space.  A  mode  emission  pattern  is 
then calculated by using the asymptotic expression for the field 
in the far zone. 

III.  CIRCULAR MICRODISKS: ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS 

High lateral and vertical optical confinement in thin-disk high-
index-contrast  circular  microcavities  results  in  extremely  high 
Q-factors  of  the  WG  modes  they  support  (classified  as 
WGE(H)m,n  modes,  m  being  the  azimuthal  number,  and  n  the 
radial number [11]). However, unidirectional in-plane emission 
required for laser applications cannot be achieved in WG-mode 
circular  cavities  due  to  the  symmetry  of  the  cavity  geometry. 
This  symmetry  of  the  structure  also  results  in  double-
degeneracy  of  the  WG  modes  (corresponding  to  mode  angular 
field  variations  cos(mφ)  and  sin(mφ)),  which  is  an  important 
issue  in  view  of  the  use  of  circular  microdisks  as  building 
blocks of optoelectronic devices. First, this degeneracy is often

IV.  GLOBAL AND LOCAL CAVITY SHAPE DEFORMATIONS 

It  has  long  been  recognized  that  a  microcavity’s  shape  can  be 
used  as  a  design  parameter  in  engineering  microcavity-based 
optoelectronic  components  [3].  Several  cavity  designs  with 
intentional  contour  deformations  have  been  demonstrated,  for 
both  optically-large  (R(cavity  size)>>λ)  and  wavelength-scale 
cavities.  They  include:  elliptical  and  stadium-shape  [2-5,  15-
20], spiral [10], and square [6-8, 21-23] microcavities as well as 
microgear  [23-25],  and  notched  microdisk  resonators  [9,  26]. 
Certainly,  automated  optimization  routines  can  be  used  to 
search  for  optimal  cavity  designs  that  would  yield  directional 
emission combined with mode selection and preservation of the 
high lasing mode Q-factor. However, without clear insight into 
the  physical  effects  in  optical  microcavities,  it  can  be  quite 
difficult  (or  even  impossible)  to  correct  a  faulty  initial 
configuration.  To  this  end,  in  the  following  sections  we 
compare various cavity shape deformations and develop general 
design  rules  as  for  choosing  the  specific  deformation  type  and 
amplitude that would be the most efficient for tuning the optical 
characteristics of a specific cavity mode. 
 

A.  Elliptical and stadium-shape microcavities 

In  optically  large  cavities,  the  directional  light  emission 
observed has been attributed to closed ray orbits, such as four-
bounce resonances in square microcavities or bow-tie modes in 
quadrupole or stadium-shape resonators (Fig. 1a).  

In  the  wavelength-scale  cavities,  the  only  such  modes  are 
Fabry-Perot-like modes with the field patterns similar to the one 
shown in Fig. 1b (see [18] for classification of all the stadium-
cavity resonances in the range 4 < Re(kR) < 5.5). These modes 
have  low  Q-factors  and  thus  high  thresholds.  Thus,  the  only 
modes  in  smaller-size  elliptical  or  quadrupolar  microcavities 
that  potentially  can  have  high  Q-factors  are  distorted  WG 
modes  [11,  18].  As  such  cavities  no  longer  have  rotational 
symmetry, but only symmetry with respect to the x- (horizontal) 
and y- (vertical) axes, the WG-modes’ degeneracy is removed. 
Instead  of  a  single  double-degenerate  WG  mode,  two  WG 
modes having either odd (O) or even (E) symmetry with respect 
to the x-axis appear in the deformed cavity spectrum.

Fig. 1. Near-field intensity portraits of (a) a bow-tie mode in an optically-large 
stadium  microcavity  (Re  (kR)  =  12.5)  and  (b)  a  Fabry-Perot-type  mode  in  a

Fig.  2  a,b  shows  shift  and  splitting  of  the  wavelengths  and 
the  change  of  the  Q-factors  of  a  transverse-magnetic  WGH6,1 
mode  in  an  elliptical  microcavity  with  the  increased  degree  of 
deformation  (here  and  thereafter,  normalized  Q-factor  values 
are  plotted,  with  Q  =  1  corresponding  to  the  circular-cavity 
value).  The  near-field  intensity  portraits  and  far-field  emission 
patterns  of  the  two  split  modes  with  odd  (Fig.  3 a,c) and even 
(Fig. 3 b,d) symmetry along the x-axis are presented in Fig. 3. It 
can be seen that the emission from elliptical microcavities is not 
unidirectional, the light emitted from the cavity collimates into 
several beams in the far-zone (Fig. 3 c,d) (see also [19] for the 
experimental demonstration of this phenomenon).

the 

By studying the modal characteristics plotted in Fig. 2, the 
following  important  observations  can  be  made:  (i)  due  to  the 
increase  of 
resonant 
the  effective  cavity  volume, 
wavelengths  of  both  WG-modes  are  red-shifted;  (ii)  the 
wavelength  spacing  between  the  two  modes  is  negligible  in 
slightly  or  moderately  deformed  cavities;  (iii)  the  Q-factors  of 
both  modes  degrade  rapidly  as  the  degree  of  deformation  is 
increased.  The  WG-mode  Q-factor  damping  in  deformed 
microcavities  has  been  experimentally  shown  to  become 
progressively  more  severe  as  the  cavity  size  was decreased. In 
[20], the dependence of the stadium-shape microlaser thresholds 
on  the  degree  of  deformation  has  been  studied  and  it  was 
revealed that the smaller the radius of the resonator, the smaller 
is the highest deformation for which stimulated emission can be 

achieved.  As  Fig.  2a  shows,  however,  the  difference  of  the 
wavelengths of the two modes in the doublet is insignificant for 
small  deformations.  This  near-degeneracy  of  the  modes  can 
result  in  mode-locking  and  asymmetrical  emission  patterns, 
similar to the circular cavity case [15, 16].

B.  Square microcavities 

Another type of global cavity deformation that has been shown 
to  split  double-degenerate  WG-modes  is  a  square  shape 
deformation  [21,  22].  Fig.  4a  demonstrates  how  changing  the 
cavity  shape  from  a  circle  to  almost  a  square  moves  the 
wavelengths of the two split TE-polarized WGE8,1 modes away 
from each other. Furthermore, as can be seen from Fig. 4b, the 
O-mode  (odd  with  respect  to  the  diagonals)  has  noticeably 
higher  Q-factor  than  the  E-mode  (even  with  respect  to  the 
diagonals).  Following 
the  original 
publications where such modes have been observed and studied, 
[21,  22],  we  classify  them  as  a  WG-like  mode  and  a 
intensity 
symmetrical  volume 
distributions of both modes are presented in Fig. 5 a,b.

It should be noted that not all the WG-modes are split by the 
square  deformation,  but  only  those  with  even  values  of  the

azimuthal  mode  numbers  (i.e.,  WG2m,1  (
[22].  The  WG2m+1,1  modes  of  the  square  cavity  are  double-
degenerate  and  have  low  Q-factors.  Thus,  the  free  spectral 
range  is  doubled  in  a  square  microcavity  in  comparison  to  its 
circular  counterpart.  However,  the  emission  patterns  of  the 
high-Q WG-like modes are not directional. Furthermore, similar 
to  the  circular  microcavity  case,  the  Q-factors  of  the  square-
cavity  WG-like  modes  are  degraded  dramatically  when  the 
cavity size is reduced to the scale of the wavelength. 

Fabrication errors can also lead to the degradation of the high 
Q-factors  of  the  square  cavity  WG-like  modes.  Among  these, 
cavity elongation along one axis is the most unfavorable type of 
deformation  [23].  However,  it  has  been  shown  that  low-
azimuthal-order  WG-like  modes  in  wavelength-scale  cavities

imperfections  (such  as  convex  walls  and  rounded  corners)  can

C.  Microgear and notched microcavities 
By  comparing  the  two  examples  discussed  above  we  can 
conclude  that  a  shape  deformation  that  is  more  discriminative 
with respect to the two mode fields enables more efficient mode 
splitting  [24].  A  deformed  microcavity  design  where  such 
discrimination  is  maximized  is  a  microgear  (microflower) 
cavity. The microgear (microflower) cavity has a sinusoidal or a 
rectangular grating at the disk edge with the period equal to the 
half  wavelength  of the WG mode in the disk material [24-26]. 
As  Fig.  6  demonstrates,  a  sinusoidal  contour  corrugation  with 
ten  full  periods  along  the  cavity  perimeter  can  be  used  to 
double-degenerate  WGE5,1  mode. 
efficiently 
Furthermore,  such  deformation  affects  one  of  the  modes  (E-
mode)  favorably  and  the  other  one  (O-mode)  unfavorably  (see 
Figs.  7  a,b).  This  makes  possible  enhancement  of  the  E-mode 
and simultaneous damping of the competing O-mode (Fig. 6b). 
However,  cavities  with  periodic  deformations  have  emission 
patterns very similar to those of circular ones.

Fig.  7.  Near-field  intensity  portraits  (a,b)  of  the  O-(suppressed)  and  E-
(enhanced) WGE5,1 modes in a microgear resonator with δ/R = 0.2. 

  
To  achieve  both  efficient  mode  splitting  and  emission 
directionality,  the  shape  deformation  should  be  discriminative 
and  at  the  same  time  should  introduce  asymmetry  in  the 
structure [4, 27]. An example of such local shape deformation, 
which we have recently proposed and studied [28], is a notched 
microdisk resonator. To maximize the mode discrimination, the 
width  of  the  notch  has  to  be  chosen  as  a  half  of  the  distance 
between  a  neighboring  maximum  and  minimum 
the 
unperturbed  WG-mode  field  pattern.  As  Fig.  8  shows,  such  a 
notch has a more significant effect on the E-mode, which has a 
field  maximum  on  the  x-axis,  i.e.,  in  the  region  of  the  notch, 
than on the O-mode, which has a zero field at the same location 
(see Fig. 9 for the near-field portraits of these modes). 

in 

It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the two modes are efficiently 
split  by  such  a  deformation.  Unfortunately,  the  unidirectional 
emission  is  observed  for  the  E-mode  (Fig.  9d),  which  has  a 
lower Q-factor than the O-mode. However, the mode splitting is 
rather  significant  even  for  shallow  notches.  Furthermore,  the 
unidirectional  emission  pattern  forms  even  for  small  values  of 
the  notch  depth  and  is  relatively  stable  to  small  variations  in 
notch  width  and  depth  [28].  Thus,  the  E-mode  can  still  offer 
potential for realizing low-threshold lasing with directional light 
output.

D.  Coupled-microdisk photonic molecules 
Photonic  molecules 

(i.e.,  clusters  of  closely-located 
electromagnetically-coupled microcavities [29-35]) offer higher 
design flexibility than deformed microdisk resonators.  Careful 
control  of  the  mutual  coupling  between  individual  resonators 
forming  photonic  molecules  makes  possible  manipulation  of 
their  modal  frequencies  and  quality  factors.  When  individual 
microdisks  are  brought  close  to  each  other,  in  place  of  every 
double-degenerate  WG-mode  in  their  optical  spectrum  there 

appears  a  number  (equal  to  double  the  number  of  cavities)  of 
coupled photonic molecule supermodes [29]. Properly designed 
and  optimally  tuned  photonic  molecule  configurations  have 
been  shown  to  enable  efficient  WG-mode  degeneracy  splitting 
accompanied  by  a  significant  enhancement  of  the  Q-factor  of 
non-degenerate  molecule  modes  [31,  34,  35].  However,  the 
non-degenerate  modes  studied  before  in  various  symmetrical 
configurations do not produce directional emission patterns. 

Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrate the 
possibility  of  intentional  manipulation  of  the  emission  patterns 
of  the  photonic  molecule  modes  by  tuning  the  molecule 
geometry. As one of possible photonic molecule configurations, 
we consider a cross-shaped structure composed of five identical 
evanescently-coupled  microdisk  resonators.  In  an  ideal  cross, 
some  of  the  photonic  molecule  modes  are  again  double-
degenerate due to the symmetry of the structure. By introducing 
asymmetry  in  the  cross-shaped  photonic  molecule  (increasing 
the cavity separation in the horizontal direction) we can observe 
(Fig.  10)  splitting  of  a  double-degenerate  WG-mode  into  two 
non-degenerate  modes  of  different  symmetry  (EO:  even  with 
respect  to  the  x-axis  and  odd  with  respect  to  the  y-axis,  and 
OE). Furthermore, this procedure yields enhancement of the EO 
mode  with  a  highly  directional  emission  pattern  (Fig.  11  a,c) 
and  suppression  of  the  competing  OE  mode  (Fig.  11  b,d) 
considered parasitic. However, the Q-factor of the enhanced EO 
mode  is  still  only  a  quarter  of  that  of  the  WGE7,1  mode  in  the 
isolated circular microcavity.

Fig.  10.  Wavelength  shift  (a)  and  Q-factor  change  (b)  of  the  EO  (high-Q)  and 
OE (low-Q) modes in a cross-shaped photonic molecule vs the sideways shift of 
the  left  and  the  right  cavities  from  their  positions  in  a  symmetrical  molecule 
geometry.  R  (microdisk  radius)  =  0.75  μm,  d/R  (edge-to-edge  distance  in  a 
symmetrical configuration) = 0.15 μm, n = 3.162. 

 
It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the two modes are efficiently 
split  by  such  a  deformation.  Unfortunately,  the  unidirectional 
emission  is  observed  for  the  E-mode  (Fig.  9d),  which  has  a 
lower Q-factor than the O-mode. However, the mode splitting is 
rather  significant  even  for  shallow  notches.  Furthermore,  the 
unidirectional  emission  pattern  forms  even  for  small  values  of 
the  notch  depth  and  is  relatively  stable  to  small  variations  in 
notch  width  and  depth  [28].  Thus,  the  E-mode  can  still  offer 
potential for realizing low-threshold lasing with directional light 
output.

As  we  have  shown  before,  low-azimuthal-order  WG  modes

molecule  geometry 
Nevertheless,  highly  directional  emission  patterns  have  also 
been  demonstrated  in  optically-large  double-disk  molecules 
operating  on  high-azimuthal-order  WG  modes  [36].  Precise 
positioning of the cavities in the optimized configuration can be 
achieved  with  modern  fabrication  techniques  [30],  and  the 
estimates of the sensitivity of photonic molecule characteristics 
to  size  and  position  disorder  can  be  found  in  [37]  and  [31].  It 
should also be noted that while TE and TM spectra of photonic 
molecules  of  the  same  configuration  have  similar  features  that 
are  mainly  determined  by  the  symmetry  properties  of  the 
molecular  geometry  and  inter-cavity  coupling  distances  [34], 
their  emission  patterns  can  differ  drastically  [37].  This  feature 
makes  possible  using  the  polarization  of  the  electromagnetic 
field  as  another  tuning  parameter  for  cavity  optimization,  and 
also  paves  a  way  for  designing  polarization  splitters  and 
detectors based on photonic molecules. 

optical microcavity with the help of distributed Bragg reflectors 
has been used before in the designs of grating-assisted standing-
wave  rectangular  microresonators  [38]  and  annular  Bragg 
resonators  [39,  40].  The  former  employs  a  number  of  linear 
Bragg  reflectors  on  both  sides  of  the  rectangular  microcavity, 
while  the  latter  is  based  on  a  set  of  radial  Bragg-reflectors 
surrounding  a  circular  micro-resonator.  In  both  cases,  the 
structures  support  non-degenerate  optical  modes  (either  due  to 
the non-symmetry of the rectangular resonator [38] or due to the 
choice  of  a  small-radius  circular  microdisk  supporting  a  non-
degenerate fundamental mode as a core of the annular structure 
[39]).  Neither  of  these  structures  enables  directional  light 
output,  although  in-plane  coupling  into  and  out  of  annular 
Bragg  resonators  with  optical  waveguides  has  recently  been 
demonstrated [40].

of the EO- (high-Q) and OE- (low-Q) WGH7,1 modes in an asymmetrical cross-
shaped photonic molecule with Δx = 0.15 μm. 

E.  Photonic-crystal-assisted microdisk resonator 
As mentioned before, due to the exponential decrease of the 
circular-cavity WG-mode Q-factors with decreasing cavity size, 
it is challenging to achieve stimulated emission in wavelength- 
and sub-wavelength size microdisk resonators. To suppress the 
in-plane mode energy leakage and enhance the mode Q-factor, 
we  propose  to  enclose  a  microdisk  resonator  in  a  finite-size 
square-lattice  photonic  crystal  composed  of  rods  of  the  same 
material  as  the  microdisk  resonator.  The  radii  of  the  rods  and 
the lattice constant are chosen in such a way that the frequency 
of the microdisk WGE6,1 mode is located inside the bandgap of 
the photonic crystal.  

The idea of enhancing the in-plane mode confinement in the

of  the  E  (λ  =  3.075  μm,  Qnorm  =  5.605)  and  O  (λ  =  3.069  μm,  Qnorm  =  5.3) 
WGH6,1 modes in a PhC-assisted microdisk. R (microdisk radius) = 1.25 μm, r 
(rods radii) = 0.2 μm, a (lattice constant) = 1.0 μm, n = 3.4. 
 

In the proposed photonic-crystal-assisted microdisk structure 
(Fig.  12),  due  to  the  C4ν  symmetry  of  the  enclosing  photonic 
crystal lattice, the degeneracy of the WGE6,1 mode is removed. 
Here, the modes are classified as E- and O-modes (having either 
even or odd symmetry along the square diagonals, respectively). 
Both  the  split  modes  are  enhanced  in  comparison  with  the 
single-microdisk  case.  It  should  also  be noted that because the 
inner  microdisk  operates  on  a  WG-mode,  radiation  in  the 
direction perpendicular to the cavity plane (which is a dominant 
loss  mechanism  in  point-defect  photonic  crystal  microcavities 
is  also 
and  small-radius-core  annular  Bragg  resonators) 
efficiently suppressed.  

Furthermore,  by  removing  the  two  rods  from  the  square-
lattice  photonic  crystal  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  12  a,b,  we  can 
obtain not only degenerate mode splitting, but also a directional

emission  pattern  of  the  E-mode  (Fig.  12  a,c).  The  structure 
discussed above is only one of many possible configurations of 
hybrid  microcavity  structures  based  on  the  combined  effect  of 
TIR  and  DBR 
light  confinement  mechanisms.  Another 
promising  design  would  be  a  circular  cavity  enclosed  in  a 
triangular  photonic  crystal  lattice  that  is  also  expected  to  yield 
both  mode  enhancement  and  degeneracy  removal.  However, 
both structures enable manipulation of the TM-polarized modes 
only, as the TE modes do not have a practically useful bandgap 
in the photonic crystal lattice composed of dielectric rods. 

V.  OTHER MECHANISMS OF SELECTIVE MODE ENHANCEMENT 

It  should  be  noted  that  further  enhancement  of  the 
microcavity modes can be achieved by enabling better spectral 
alignment  of  the  mode  wavelength  with  the  semiconductor 
material  gain  peak  [41].  As  a  possible  way  to  selectively 
enhance  only  one  of  the  split  WG-modes,  both  spatial  and 
spectral alignment with the gain media (i.e., with a needle pump 
or a selectively-grown quantum dot (QD)) should be achieved. 
For  example,  selective  needle-point  pumping  of  the  central 
region  of  the  quadrupolar  microcavity  is  believed  to  yield 
enhancement of the bow-tie modes, which have high intensity at 
the  resonator  center,  over  the  distorted  WG-modes  with 
comparable Q-factors [5, 17].

cross-shaped molecule, and (c) photonic-crystal-assisted microdisk together with 
possible  locations  of  the  selectively-grown  quantum  dots  that  would  enable 
enhancing one of the WG-modes with directional emission. 
 

Furthermore, the possibility of achieving spectral and spatial 
alignment  of  the  photonic  crystal  defect  cavity  mode  with  a 
selectively  grown  QD  has  also  been  demonstrated  [42].  Based 
on the above examples, we can predict that placing selectively-
grown  QDs  in  pre-defined  locations,  where  the  best  spatial 
overlap with the mode field will be achieved (as shown in Fig. 
13),  could  selectively  enhance  the  WG-modes  with  the 
directional emission patterns. 

VI.  CONCLUSIONS 

Based  on  previously  developed  highly  accurate  integral-
equation  method  and  simulation  tools,  we  have  found  general 
design  rules  to  find  specific  local  and  global  deformations  of 
wavelength-scale  microcavities  that  yield  quasi-single-mode 
operation  and  directional  light  output.  These  rules  can  be 
summarized as follows. First, the deformation should affect two 
competing WG modes in a different way (i.e., favor one mode 
of  a  doublet  and  disfavor  the  other  or  shift  their  resonant 

frequencies in opposite directions). Second, it should break the 
geometrical  symmetry  of  the  structure  in  order  to  single  out  a 
preferred direction of the emission and thus obtain a directional 
light  output.  Finally,  the  deformation  should  be  size-  and/or 
shape-matched  to  the  mode  near-field  distribution  in  order  to 
have  a  noticeable  effect  on  the  mode  spectral  and  emission 
characteristics.  Several  previously  studied  and  two  novel 
microcavity  designs  built  by  applying  these  rules  have  been 
presented  and  studied.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  some  cases 
directional  emission  can  only  be  obtained  at  the  expense  of 
lowering  the  corresponding  mode  Q-factor.  However,  some 
ways to selectively enhance the mode with directional emission 
pattern have been discussed.

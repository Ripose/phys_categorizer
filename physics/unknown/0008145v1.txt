Abstract 

A  5-MeV  RFQ  designed  for  a  proton  current  up  to 
100-mA  CW  is  now  under  construction  as  part  of  the 
High  Intensity  Proton  Injector  project  (IPHI).  Its 
computed  transmission  is  greater  than  99 %.  The  main 
goals  of  the  project  are  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the 
design codes, to gain the know-how on fabrication, tuning 
procedures  and  operations,  to  measure  the  output  beam 
characteristics in order to optimise the higher energy part 
of the linac, and to reach a high availability with minimum 
beam  trips.  A  cold  model  has  been  built  to  develop  the 
tuning  procedure.  The  present  status  of  the  IPHI  RFQ  is 
presented.

INTRODUCTION 

intense  spallation  neutron 

Over  the  last  10  years,  in-depth  studies  have  been 
carried  out  on  the  feasibility  of  high-power  proton 
accelerators capable of producing beams of several tens of 
MW.  With  heavy  targets,  such  beams  can  produce 
extremely 
flux.  Several 
applications  could  benefit  from  the  performance  of  this 
new  generation  of  high-power  proton  accelerators  [1]: 
spallation  neutron  sources  for  condensed  matter  studies, 
hybrid  reactors  for  nuclear  waste  transmutation,  neutrino 
and  muon  factories, 
tools, 
production  of  radioactive  ion  beams,  production  of 
radioisotopes, etc.

irradiation 

IPHI  (“Injector  of  Protons  for  High-Intensity  beams”) 
is a 1 MW low energy prototype, which could be used as 
front  end  for  such  high-power  proton  accelerators  [2]. 
This  demonstrator  is  made  up  of  the  SILHI  ECR  source 
able  to  deliver  more  than  100 mA  CW  at  95 keV,  the 
5 MeV  RFQ  and  a  10 MeV  DTL.  IPHI  is  designed  to 
operate up to 100% duty factor (CW). 

2  RFQ BEAM DYNAMICS 

The  input  energy  of  95 keV  results  of  a  compromise 
between  RFQ  length,  source  reliability  and  space-charge 
control.  The  5 MeV  output  energy 
results  of  a 
compromise between cavity length, feasibility of the DTL 
using  EM  quadrupoles,  and  high  beam transmission. The 
use  of  existing  klystron  at  352.2 MHz  leads  to  an 
optimum size of the cavity. The design current of 100 mA 
has  been  selected  to  reach  a  high  reliability  at  the  lower 
currents  needed  by 
the  different  applications.  The 
expected  normalised  rms  emittance  from  the  source  is 
0.2 p
.mm.mrad.  Nevertheless,  a  safety  margin  is  taken 
using 0.25 p

.mm.mrad in beam dynamics calculations. 

The maximum electric field has been limited to 1.7 Kp 

(31.34 MV/m)  taking  into  account  experiences  with  the 
CRITS Experiment at Los Alamos and RFQs operated at 
Saclay in the past. The RFQ cavity length was set to 8 m. 
Great  care  was taken on lost particles in the RFQ cavity. 
The final design has been selected to avoid localised and 
high-energy losses (activation), and to provide the highest 
transmission  avoiding  any  bottle  neck  [3].  Many  beam 
dynamics computations including error studies have been 
done  using  several  complementary  codes  (PARMTEQM, 
TOUTATIS  [4,6],  and  LIDOS.RFQ  [5]).  Table  1  gives 
the main parameters of the RFQ.

The  new  TOUTATIS  code  [6]  allows  to  take  into 
account the field errors in the coupling section as well as 
the mechanical defaults (vane extremities displacement...). 
The  LIDOS.RFQ  code  allowed  to  establish  the  required 
machining  precision.  Lots  of  errors  were  simulated  with 
the coupling gaps to ensure a “faults tolerant” design.

3  RFQ CAVITY 

The  structure  is  made  up  of  8  one-meter  long  sections 
accurately  machined  and  brazed  then  assembled  with  a 
resonant  coupling  every  2  meters  (similar  to  the  LEDA 
design  [8]).  Details  of  the  "Main  steps  for  fabrication  of 
the  IPHI  RFQ"  are  published  in  these  proceedings 
(THD03, M Painchault et al.).

The  coupling  plates  allow  a  damping  of  the  rf 
longitudinal  parasitic  modes  and  the  introduction  of 
fingers to push away the dipolar modes. The RF design of 
the  cavity 
intensive  3D  simulations  and 
developments [7] with cross-checking on the cold model. 
The  field  will  be  tuned  using  128  tuners  equally 
distributed  along  the  RFQ.  The  8  Thomson  RF  windows 
are  already  on  hand,  similar  windows  have  been 
successfully tested up to 700 kW at LANL for LEDA [8]. 
The low level RF is still under definition. A pick-up will 
be  used  for  the  fast  phase  and  amplitude  control  using 
DSP.  The  slow  frequency  tuning  will  be  done  using  the 
cooling  system  of  the  cavity  based  on  the  LEDA  design 
[8].  The  inlet  water  temperature  is 10°C/50°F with water 
flows tuneable up to 6 m/s. An erosion/corrosion analysis 
is presently done. 

Great  care  has  been  put  into  the  optimization  of  the 
pumping  system.  Two  of  the  1-m  long  sections  are 
dedicated  to  the  rf  feed  while  all  the  remaining  sections 
are  equipped  with  a  total  of  72  pumping  ports  carefully 
designed  to  maximize  the  pumping  speed.  The  running 
pressure is expected to be 8 10-6 Pa.

4  COLD MODEL 

3.1  Objectives 

The  fabrication  of  a  RFQ  cold  model  started  at  the 
beginning  of  1999.  The  aluminium  cavities  have  been 
designed close to those of the final RFQ with possible fast 
adjustments  of  the  geometry  to  test  different  end  vane 

configurations,  consequences  of  vane  position  errors...  It 
is  now  mainly  used  to  develop  the  RF  tuning  procedures 
and  the  associated  hardware  and  software.  Some  of  the 
development  will  be  used  to  help  on  vane  positioning 
before  the  brazing  step  with  an  expected  precision  better 
than 10-5 m.  

3.2  Design 

The  1:1  scale  cold  model  has  been  designed  using 
SUPERFISH for the main region and MAFIA for the end 
regions.  The  transverse  section  is  composed  of  flat  faces 
only,  the  tips  of  the  electrodes  are  circular  (r /r0  =  0,85). 
The  design  has  been  done  for  a  resonance  frequency  of 
350.7 MHz  with  all  the  tuners  flush  mounted  and 
352.2 MHz with the tuners 5 mm inside the cavity. 

3.3  Modularity 

 

Figure 4 : transverse view of the RFQ cold model. 

The  cold  model  consists  of  octagonal  1-meter  long 
sections  in  which  the  4  electrodes  are  screwed.  Three 
different kinds of end pieces may be screwed to the main 
electrodes:  input/output  beam,  coupling  region  and  plain 
pieces. This last type allows to form a 2 meters long RFQ 
with  a  continuous  electrode.  Three  different  kinds  of 
segments can be used : 
1-  “pumping” type with the same slug tuners distribution 

as the final pumping segments, 

2-  “RF  coupling”  type  with  one  rectangular  hole  per 
quadrant  to  allow  the  study  of  RF  power  coupling 
through irises, 

type  with  8 

3-  “Tuners  over-equipped” 

tuners  per 
quadrant  instead  of  4  for  an  accurate  study  of  the 
voltage law tuning. 
One  “pumping”  section  and  one  “Tuners  over-
equipped”  section  are  tested  since  August  99.  The 
measured  resonance  frequencies  with  the  tuners  at  the 
nominal  position  are  respectively  350.054 MHz  and 
351.24 MHz,  the  relative  error  is  less  than  3.10-3.  The 
lower 2 dipole modes are about 700 kHz apart. Four more 
segments will be tested soon. 

An  elaborated  pulley  system  guides  the  bead  on 
the  4  quadrants  allowing  a

Figure 6 shows the result of a 4-quadrant analysis. The 
magnetic  field  of  the  “over-equipped”  type  segment  has 
been perturbed with a titanium bead guided close to flush 
mounted  tuners.  The  left  hand  side  figures  are  plots  of 
modal  combinations  of  capacitances  over  the  theoretical 
capacitance C versus the longitudinal position z [m]. The 
plots at right are the Ci/C for each quadrant. All the curves 
are  well  within  plus  and  minus  1%  indicating  a  very 
accurate  machining  and  positioning  of  the  4  quadrants. 
The  measurement  of  the  capacitances  is  reproducible 
within 2.10-3 . 

5  CONCLUSION 

The  detailed  design  of  the  IPHI  RFQ  is  now  nearly 
completed.  Great  progress  has  been  done  on  the  RF 
tuning procedures using the cold model. The construction 
of  a  one-meter  long  copper  prototype  will  be  finished  in 
September.  The  delivery  of  the  first  RFQ  section  is 
expected  for  the  end  of  2000  and  the  8  sections  must  be 
available  mid  2002.  The  assembly  will  start  before  the 
reception  of  the  last  section  as  shown  in  the  planning 
below.  The  first  beam  is  expected  late  2002  /  beginning 
2003.

3.4  RF diagnostics 

The  fields  are  measured  using  the  common  bead–pull 
perturbation  method.  A  DC  motor  drives  the  bead  and  a 
vector network analyser (VNA) measures the phase of the 
transmission coefficient (s21). Operation of the DC motor 
and  the  VNA  is  fully  automatic,  both  being  driven  by  a 
LabView  program  on  PC.  Measurements  are  readily 
available in data files. 

3.5  Measurement analysis 

The  data  are  then  treated  through  a  Matlab  code.  The 
first  step  is  the  conversion  of  the  measured  phases  into 
voltages  versus  position  for  each  quadrant,  all  expressed 
in  arbitrary  units  since  no  attempt  is  made  to  derive  the 
polarisability  of  the  bead  or  the  phase  versus  frequency 
slope  of  the  s21.  Smoothing  and  windowing  produce 
direct  usable  data.  The  second  step  is  the  analysis  of  the 
data  from  the  4-quadrants.  The  RFQ  is  modelled  as  a 
4-wire  line  system.  The  spectral  theory  of  differential 
operators is used to relate the measured voltages along the 
line  to  the  physical  parameters  describing  the  whole  RF 
circuit  (the  parallel  capacitances  Ci  or  inductances  Li  of 
each quadrant i versus the position and the end loads).

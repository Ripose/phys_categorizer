 Short and long range interactions between earthquakes are attracting increasing interest1,2,3,4. 

Scale invariant properties of seismicity5,6,7,8 in time, space and energy argue for the presence 

of complex triggering mechanisms9 where, like a cascade process, each event produces 

aftershocks10. A definitive method to assess any connection between two earthquakes 

separated in time and distance does not exist. Here we propose a novel method of data 

analysis that, based on the space-time combined generalization of the correlation integral11 

leads to a self-consistent visualization and analysis of both spatial and temporal correlations. 

When analyzing global seismicity we discovered a universal relation linking the spatial 

Influence Length  of a given earthquake to the time 

τ elapsed from the event itself:

ατ−≈iR

. Following an event, time correlations (i.e. causality effects) exist in a 

region of radius 

 that shrinks over time, suggesting a long-range dissipating stress transfer.

A different process is acting in the short-range where events are randomly set, evidencing a

sub-diffusive growth
 
Earthquakes appear to occur in clusters with scale invariant patterns in both space and time 7,8,15. To date, analysis has 
tended  to  focus  separately  on  either  spatial  or  temporal  correlations,  with  some  notable  exceptions  16,17.  Many 

earthquake  properties  point  to  a  hierarchical  organization,  suggesting  a  connection  among  events  that  could  be 

explained physically by stress transfer mechanisms and a scale invariant fracturing of the crust. Due to the complexity 

2 

of the phenomenon, the influence of an earthquake over surrounding areas cannot be simply assessed, especially for 

long range effects. Seismicity is a multidimensional scale invariant process and every catalogue choice corresponds to 

an implicit multidimensional sizing (a defined window in energy, time and space: often dependent on data availability). 
In our opinion all these features are inextricably linked18, calling for a combined analytical approach that can reveal 

important  features  previously  not  apparent.  In  this  paper,  a  new  method  that  leads  to  a  self-consistent  analysis  and 

visualization  of  both  spatial  and  temporal  correlations  is  introduced.  We  have  defined  the  space-time  combined 

correlation integral as:

. When applied over all possible values of 

τ or  r , the well-known Grassberger-Procaccia correlation integral11 is returned. Such a definition takes into account 

the  distribution  of  all  time  intervals  and  epicentral  inter-distances  between  all  pairs  of  events,  irrespective  of  the 

relationship between the main event and any aftershock.  

From the space-time combined correlation integral we define the time correlation dimension for sets of events within 
space-time distances r  and τ , as:  

Similarly we define the space correlation dimension, for sets of events within space-time distances r  and τ , as:

If 

),( τrC

was  a  pure  power-law  in  both  variables,  then

tD

 and 

sD would  correspond  to  the  temporal  and  spatial 

fractal  dimensions,  respectively.  More  generally,  the  behaviour  of 

tD

 and 

sD  as  a  function  of  r  and τ will 

characterise the clustering features of earthquakes in space and in time. The possibility of handling a combined space-

time  correlation  function  allows  for  the  investigation  of  seismic  features  where  space  and  time  are  inextricably 
linked9,19.  It  is  important  to  remark  how  the  advantage  of  the  method  of  analysis  proposed  lies  in  the  possibility  to 

simultaneously consider space and time correlations without a priori hypothesis: in fact, the method does not require 

any arbitrary choice of space or time windows. 

We have started our analysis by considering world wide seismicity with the intention of making clear the most general 

space-time correlations. Subsequently, we compare our results with those obtained using local catalogues. From global 

seismic records we have selected epicenters in the time period between 1973 and 2002, with magnitudes greater than 5 

(National  Earthquake  Information  Center,  U.S.G.S).  This  catalogue  selection  was  conditioned  by  a  criteria  of 

 

scale.

and time interval.

clustering.  In  Fig.  1.b  the  same  key  applies  to  the  colour-coded  map  of  the  space  correlation  dimension

sD as  a 

function of space and time. In this case, values of 

sD  approaching 2.0 on the scale identify sets of events uniformly 

distributed in space, while lower values of 

sD indicate a clustered spatial distribution of the epicenters (always within 

a  given  distance  and  time  interval).    It  is  remarkable  to  note  how  the  patterns  observed  in  Figs.  1.a  and  1.b,  which 

correspond  to  non-trivial  structures  in  space  and  time  for  the  correlations,  significantly  support  our  realisation  that 

earthquakes do interact in space and in time. In order to check this hypothesis we have applied the same analysis to the 

global catalogue after reshuffling the time and epicenter locations of the events (keeping epicentral coordinates fixed 

and  mixing  occurrence  dates).  The  results  reported  in  Fig.  1.c  and  1.d    show  that  all  patterns  vanish,  evidencing 

constant high values of 

tD

 and 

sD  at all distance and time intervals. These results point strongly in favour of non-

trivial interactions among earthquakes. Let us now comment on specific features emerging from our analysis. 

Time  clustering.  In  figure  1.a  two  main  domains  appear:  one  at  shorter  inter-distances  with  low 

tD

 (time 

clustering)  representing  a  causal  connection;  the  other  with 

tD ≅  indicating  a  random  time  occurrence  of  events.

The boundary between these two domains is not sharp but, by defining the randomness limit at 

tD =

0.8

, a functional 

relationship  can  be  extracted  between  the  spatial  separation and  the  temporal  distance

τ .  The  results  reported  in 

r

Figure 2 indicate dependence of r

ατ−∝

, with

α≅

±

. If we now interpret τ  as the time elapsed since a 

given  earthquake  and  we  define  the  distance  from  its  epicenter  r  as  Influence  Length 

iR ,  we  could  argue  that  the 

functional relation 

 describes how the size of the region causally connected to the given earthquake changes 

iR

ατ−∝

over  time.  In  particular,  a  power-law  shrinkage  of  the  region  can  be  seen.  If  compared  to  a  homogeneous  time 

distribution, this area of influence can be interpreted as a region of modified probability of earthquake time occurrence. 

Valid for worldwide seismicity, this relation has been verified for local catalogues with different magnitude ranges and 

tectonic  settings  (see  captions  of  figures  2.a  and  2.b  for  details).  In  Fig.  2.b  it  is  important  to  note  that  raising  the 

threshold  level  of  lower  magnitude  data  does  not  alter  the  power-law  behaviour

iR ,  with  approximately  the  same 

exponent and a pre-factor appearing dependent on the magnitude cut-off. In perspective, the relation seems to express a 

universal feature of the response properties of the earth crust to the occurrence of an earthquake. 

Space clustering properties are shown in Figure 1.b for the worldwide seismicity catalogue: different domains are 

easily  recognised.  At  short  distances  a  high  space  correlation  dimension  behaviour  is  clearly  separated  from  space 

clustering (

) that is present at greater distances: both conditions last for inter-time up to 100 days. There is 

 

4 

no clear demarcation between the two regions but, when fixing the limit of clustering at

, it appears that the area 

sD =

with  high  correlation  dimension  is  evolving  with  time.  In  particular,  the  line  separating  randomly  filled  areas  from 

g
those with space clustering follows the relation  lo

 (with τ and r defined as above). Localisation 

errors  play  an  important  role  at  short  spatial  ranges,  giving  high  values  of

sD ,  but  the  increasing  limit  detected 

advocates the presence of a physical process. The separation line defines a radius

oR , slowly growing in time, within 

which seismic events are spatially uniformly distributed. This finding is in agreement with the accepted migration of 
aftershocks  away  from  a  main  shock20    based  on  the  interpretation  of  uniformly  spatially  distributed  events  as 

aftershocks.  Many  authors  have  described  this  migration  in  terms  of  a  law

 corresponding  to  a 

sub-diffusive process

12,13,14 often observed for local situations. Different behaviour can be observed over larger spatial 

ranges depending on the time intervals between events. 

 We summarize the results in Figure 3 where we recognize a ‘near field’ domain, evidenced by the behaviour of the 

space correlation dimension, and a ‘far field’ domain, defined by the behaviour of the time correlation dimension. Both 

domain ranges evolve in time: the first one slowly increasing and the latter quickly shrinking. An interpretation of this 
scenario in terms of stress transfer mechanisms21 is possible.  

A given earthquake induces different  kinds  of  stress  transfer  mechanisms  that  can  generally  be  categorised  as  either 

coseismic  or  postseismic.  The  first  group  is  based  on  the  elastic  properties  of  the  crust  and  can  be  either  static  or 

dynamic.  Postseismic  stress  transfer  (sometimes  referred  to  as  quasi-static)  is  associated  with  the  slow  viscous 

relaxation of the lower part of the crust and the upper part of the mantle. The debate is wide open as to which of these 

mechanisms is principally responsible for triggering an  earthquake.  It  is  generally  accepted4 that  stress  changes  σd  

decay  over  distance  s  as  the  power-law 

sσ
d

−∝
| a
|

with  the  exponent  a  dependent  on  the  specific  mechanisms  of 

stress  transfer  and  on  the  lithosphere  rheology.  A  general  distinction  can  be  made  between  ‘near  field’  behaviour, 

occurring at distances from the triggering event in the order of the fault length (and more generally of the order of the 

size  of  the  seismogenic  structure),  and  ‘far  field’  or  long-range  behaviour.  Many  factors  drive  stress  transfer  and 

seismicity in the near field such as: complicated source mechanisms, pre-existing weakness zones, heterogeneity of the 
fault plane22 and fluid migration23. When focusing on the far field, i.e. on what happens in a region much larger than 

the fault length, many of these factors integrate out and a general statistical description appears possible. This longer 

range indicates an ever changing stress field that tends to weaken over time, either by earthquake occurrences or by 

aseismic creep (slow slips not generating elastic waves) and, more generally, by all the mechanisms falling under the 
denomination  of  stress  leakage24,  25.  Depending  on  the  distance  from  the  main  event,  an  alteration  in  stress  can 
statistically affect the failure probability26 and, hence, the seismicity rate27. Greater the stress change detected, greater 

should  be  the  seismicity  rate  change.  Consequently,  for  very  small  stress  changes  the  triggering/shadowing  effect  is 

negligible and suggests the existence of some sort of elastic threshold, below which the stress change should not be 

able to affect the seismicity rate. Such a lower cut-off could be identified, for instance, with the level of  ‘tidal stress’ 

that  is  induced  by  the  distortion  of  the  earth  caused  by  the  pull  of  the  sun  and  moon.  Typical  values  of  tidal  stress 

5 

changes  are  in  the  order  of  0.01  bars,  and  do  not  directly  influence  seismicity28.  Adoption  of  this  threshold  allows 

identification  of  a  length  scale, 

,  defined  as  the  distance  from  the  main  event’s  epicenter  for  which  the  stress 

)(tR

change falls below the lower cut-off. We interpret this length scale 

 as the radius of the region causally connected 

)(tR

to the main event  t seconds after the event itself. Since the level of stress change drops over time one should expect 

that 

)(tR

 decreases  over  time.  This  is  what  can  be  observed  if  we  interpret

)(tR

 and 

t

 as  the  previously 

defined

iR andτ .  

In summary, we have introduced a new statistical tool, the combined space-time correlation integral, which allows us 

to  perform  a  simultaneous  and  self-consistent  investigation  of  the  spatial  and  temporal  correlation  properties  of 

earthquakes. This tool leads to the discovery, visualization and deep analysis of the complex interrelationships existing 

between  the  spatial  distribution  of  epicenters  and  their  occurrence  in  time.  Three  main  results  emerged:  The 

comparison  between  space  and  time  correlations  performed  on  the  worldwide  seismicity  catalogue  and  the 

corresponding reshuffled catalogue, strongly suggests that earthquakes do interact spatially and temporally. From the 

study of time clustering, a new universal relation linking the so-called ‘Influence Length’ of an earthquake and the time 

elapsed  since  its  occurrence  is  discovered.  Finally,  analysis  of  the  space  clustering  reveals  the  existence  of  a  region 

where events are uniformly distributed in space. The size of this region increases slowly with time, supporting existing 

theories on aftershock diffusion. Together the results set the basis for basis further validation on both worldwide and 
local  scales,  as  well  as  for  suitable  modelling29.  Beyond  relevance  in  seismology  it  is  worth  stressing  how  our 

contribution  could  be  potentially  important  in  a  wider  context,  where  understanding  the  interplay  of  spatial  and 

temporal  correlations  is  crucial  for  the  correct  interpretation  of  phenomena  such  as  solar  flares,  acoustic  emissions, 

dynamical systems theory, and the dynamics of extended systems in physics and biology.

tD

which clearly depend on time. The spatial range correlation tends to increase during the time interval from within hours 

to a few days after each event, although without a marked limit. This period of time is characterised by a perturbation 

propagation ranging from the source neighbourhood to hundreds of kilometres away. The time correlation spatial range 

decreases during the interval from few days to circa 

days, clearly defining a region of seismic time related activity 

410

from random event occurrence. (Figure 2 shows this correlation boundary with further details.) b = Spatial correlation 

of global seismicity. The epicenter space correlation dimension ranges from extreme clustering (

sD =

) to random 

space  distribution  (

).  At  short  distances  in  the  order  of  seismic  source  dimensions  (10-30  km),  there  are 

sD =

2

prevailing high values (

sD >

1.5

): this can be interpreted as the elevated random space filling tendency of epicenters 

over  the  seismogenic  zone.  Separation  between  space  randomness  and  space  clustering  as  a  function  of  time  is 

evidenced (continuous line). The upper limit (dotted line) shows a decreasing range in time of around two orders of 

magnitude.  This  can  be  interpreted  as  a  space  connection:  seismic  sources  act  like  a  seismic  attractor  over  a  space 

whose range is shrinking over time. It should be noted that low space correlation does not imply the uniqueness of a 

10 

seismic  source,  but  that  seismicity  is  allowed  on  specific  correlated  structures.  The  disappearance  of  clustering  with 

time  leaves  room  to  a  general

 correlation  dimension,  interpreted  as  the  activity  of  seismicity  on  plate

of their occurrence.

the  stress  perturbation  reaches  long  distances  (typically  of  the  order  of  thousands  of  kilometres  for  medium-large 

magnitudes)  and  seismicity  is  modified  inside  a  range  that  we  name  Influence  Length 

iR  (blue  circle).  This  causal 

connection region then shrinks over time with a power-law behaviour. Meanwhile, in the near-field, aftershocks slowly 

diffuse in random patterns, within an area of increasing size (red circle).

Abstract

The scales of the Standard Model correspond to the positions of domain wall intersections on a

straight line in a noncompact two-dimensional extra space. The domain walls partition an Anti-

de Sitter spacetime. We show that domain wall intersections mark the orthogonal intersections

of 1-cycles winding around a rectangular compact space and a hierarchy of subspaces, and that

the  noncompact  extra  space  of  the  model  is  a  covering  space.  4-branes  wrap  1-cycles  of  the

compact spaces and intersect orthogonally in 3-branes, upon which the particles propagate. We

show that particles are located precisely at domain wall intersections in the covering space.

1   Introduction

In a previous paper [1], we related four-dimensional mass parameters to the positions of lattice

points  in  two  infinite  extra  dimensions,  building  on  the  brane  world  models  of  Randall  and

Sundrum [2, 3]. We conjectured that the two lattices extend in two directions, y and z, in a two-

dimensional  extra  space.  Domain  walls  extending  through  the  lattice  points  partition  a  bulk

Anti-de  Sitter  (AdS)  spacetime.  The  domain  walls  lie  along  and  parallel  to  the  sides  of  cells

which tile the extra space. The scales of the Standard Model were shown to correspond to the

positions of domain wall intersections on the line y = z. Here, we will show that domain wall

intersections mark the positions of 1-cycle intersections in the covering space of a rectangular

compact space.

In  the  Randall  and  Sundrum  RSI  model  [2],  the  Standard  Model  particles  and  forces  are
confined to a 3-brane, the ‘weak’ brane, at a fixed point of the S1/Z2 orbifold. The Planck brane

is located at the other fixed point of the orbifold. The two branes are separated by a slice of AdS

spacetime, of curvature k. The natural scale on the weak brane is suppressed from Planck-scale

by a warp factor exp(-ky), where y is the coordinate of the extra dimension. In the RSII model

[3], there is only one brane, at y = 0 in an infinite dimension, upon which the Standard Model

particles and forces are confined. Lykken and Randall [4], and Oda [5, 6], have shown that we

can live on a brane, separate from the Planck brane, in the infinite dimension. Arkani-Hamed,

Dimopoulos, Dvali and Kaloper have shown that gravity can be localized to the intersection of

orthogonal  (2+n)-branes  lying  in  an  infinite  AdSn+4  spacetime  [7].  Aldazabal,  Franco,  Ibanez,

Rabadan  and  Uranga  have  proposed  a  model  in  which  chiral  fermions  propagate  at  brane

intersections located at different positions in an extra space, in particular at the intersections of

D4-branes wrapping 1-cycles of a 2-torus [8].

In Section 2, we will review our previous work [1]. In Section 3, we will provide evidence that

the noncompact extra space of the model is the cover of a rectangular compact space. We will

show that 1-cycles winding around the fundamental 1-cycles of the rectangle intersect upon the

line y = z in the covering space at positions that correspond to the scales of the Standard Model.

In Section 4, we will show that particles are located at the orthogonal intersections of 1-cycles

on the line y = z. 4-branes wrapping the 1-cycles intersect in 3-branes, upon which the particles

propagate.

2   Mass hierarchies from two extra dimensions

A  lattice  of  points  extending  from  the  Planck  brane  with  spacing  d/k  in  a  semi-infinite  extra

dimension corresponds, in four dimensions, to a geometric sequence of mass-energy scales that
descends  from  the  Planck  Mass  MP  (1.221  x  1019  GeV)  with  common  ratio  exp(-d),  provided

that  MP  =  M*,  where  M*  is  the  Planck  scale  of  the  higher  dimensional,  AdS,  spacetime.  By

computation,  we  found  that  the  masses  of  particles  of  all  types  fall  upon  the  levels  and

sublevels,  described  below,  of  two  such  geometric  sequences,  suggesting  that  particles  are

located  at  lattice  points  within  two  extra  dimensions.  Sequence  1  and  Sequence  2  are  of

common  ratio  2/π  and  1/π,  respectively,  to  within  1  in  105.  The  mass  mi  of  the  ith  level  of

Sequence 1 is given by

where i ≥ 0. The mass mj of the jth level of Sequence 2 is given by

where  j  ≥  0.  Principal  mass  levels  in  Sequence  1  and  Sequence  2  are  of  integer  i  and  j,

respectively. Higher order mass levels (sublevels) are of fractional i and j. For example, 1st order
levels  in  Sequence  1  are  of  half-integer  i,  while  2nd  order  levels  are  of  quarter-integer  i.  The

dimensionless  variables  i  and  j  also  measure  the  corresponding  distance  along  the  two  extra

dimensions,  from  the  Planck  region  (i  =  0,  j  =  0),  in  units  of  (1/k)ln(π/2)  and  (1/k)lnπ,

respectively. At principal lattice points in the two extra dimensions, i and j are of integer value.
Higher order lattice points divide the space between the principal (0th order) lattice points into 2n

intervals of equal length, where n is the order.

Quark  masses  in  the  MS   scheme,  as  evaluated  by  the  Particle  Data  Group  [9],  are  consistent

with the masses of principal levels in Sequence 1. The up quark mass of the model is 3.26 MeV

(i = 110). The down quark mass is 8.05 MeV (i = 108). The strange quark mass is 121 MeV (i =

102). The charm quark mass is 1.16 GeV (i = 97). The bottom quark mass is 4.48 GeV (i = 94).

The top quark mass is 166 GeV (i = 86).

The  lightest  flavoured  baryons  are  associated  with  principal  and  first  order  mass  levels  in

Sequence 1. The masses of the uds baryons Λ and Σ0 lie either side of a principal level, while

the  masses  of  Λc

+  (udc)  and  Λb

0  (udb)  lie  close  to  1st  order  levels,  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  The

masses  of  the  lightest  flavoured  mesons,  K±  and  K0,  and  the  electron  are  situated  close  to

principal levels in Sequence 2, as shown in Figure 1.

By conjecturing that the two lattices we have identified lie in two different directions, y and z,

in  a  noncompact  two-dimensional  extra  space  and  that  domain  walls  extending  through  the

lattice  points  partition  an  AdS  spacetime,  we  have  found  that  the  major  scales  of  physics

correspond to the positions of domain wall intersections (i, j) lying on the line y = z. Principal

domain  walls  intersect  at  y  =  z  where  (i/k)ln(π/2)  =  (j/k)lnπ;  that  is,  where  i/j  =  lnπ/ln(π/2)  =

2.5349. This condition is met closely at the intersection (71, 28) where i/j = 2.5357, at (109, 43)

where i/j = 2.5349, and at (147, 58) where i/j = 2.5345. The positions of these principal domain

wall intersections correspond to scales in a geometric sequence of common ratio (π/2)38 ≈ π15.

This  sequence  of  mass-energy  levels  has  its  own  set  of  sublevels,  also  corresponding  to  the

positions of domain wall intersections lying on the line y = z.

The position of the principal, or 0th order, domain wall intersection (109, 43) corresponds to a

four-dimensional  scale  of  5.12  MeV,  and  lies  exactly  half-way  between  the  positions

corresponding to the masses of the up and down quarks of Family 1 of the Standard Model. The

position  of  the  principal  intersection  (147,  58)  corresponds  to  a  scale  of  0.18  eV,  the  quasi-
degenerate neutrino mass scale [10]. The position of the 1st order domain wall intersection (14,
5.5)  corresponds  to  a  scale  of  2  x  1016  GeV,  the  GUT  scale  of  the  MSSM.  The  1st  order

intersection (90, 35.5) lies exactly half-way between the positions corresponding to the masses
of the bottom and top quarks of Standard Model Family 3. The position of the 2nd order domain

wall intersection (99.5, 39.25) corresponds to a scale of 375 MeV, the QCD scale  Λ  [11]. This

intersection also lies exactly half-way between the positions corresponding to the masses of the

strange and charm quarks of Standard Model Family 2. The Rydberg constant R∞ (13.6 eV) and
the Higgs field vacuum expectation value (246 GeV) correspond closely with 2nd and 3rd order

domain  wall  intersections,  respectively.  The  positions  of  those  intersections  corresponding  to

the scales of the Standard Model are shown in Figure 2.

3   Standard Model scales from the geometry of spacetime

We  will  hypothesize  that  the  noncompact  extra  space  of  the  model  is  the  cover  of  a  compact

space that is either a parallelogram or a rectangle with sides of length Rln(π/2) and Rlnπ, where

R is the AdS radius of curvature. We will denote by (1, 0) and (0, 1) the fundamental 1-cycles of

the compact space. The 1-cycle along the diagonal will be denoted by (1, 1). The distance in the

covering  space  from  the  Planck  region  (0,  0)  to  the  domain  wall  intersection  (i,  j)  equals  the

length of i (1, 0) cycles and j (0, 1) cycles of the compact space. In a rectangular compact space,

the (1, 1) cycle will be of length L = R{[ln(π/2)]2 + [lnπ]2}1/2. At the position of the principal

domain  wall  intersection  (109,  43),  which  corresponds  to  the  quark  mass  scale  of  Standard

Model Family 1, we find that

The principal intersection (109, 43) therefore lies at a distance from the Planck region (0, 0) that

is equal to the length of 109 (1, 0) cycles, 43 (0, 1) cycles and 40 (1, 1) cycles of a rectangular

compact space (the principal rectangle) with sides of length Rln(π/2) and Rlnπ. And since

the principal intersection (147, 58), upon which the natural scale is that of the quasi-degenerate

neutrino mass scale, lies at a distance from the Planck region (0, 0) that is equal to the length of

147 (1, 0) cycles, 58 (0, 1) cycles and, approximately, 54 (1, 1) cycles of the principal rectangle.

Also, the principal intersection (71, 28) lies at a distance from the Planck region that is equal to

the  length  of  71  (1,  0)  cycles,  28  (0,  1)  cycles  and,  approximately,  26  (1,  1)  cycles  of  the

principal  rectangle.  1-cycles  winding  around  the  (1,  0)  and  (0,  1)  cycles  of  the  principal

rectangle therefore meet, close to the line y = z in the covering space, in the principal domain

wall intersections identified earlier.

The distance from the Planck region (0, 0) to the 1st order domain wall intersection (90, 35.5),

the position of which corresponds to the quark mass scale of Standard Model Family 3, equals

the length of 90 (1, 0) cycles, 35.5 (0, 1) cycles and 33 (1, 1) cycles of the principal rectangle.

The  fractional  number  of  (0,  1)  cycles  of  the  principal  rectangle,  up  to  the  point  of  the
intersection, can be interpreted as an integer number of (0, 1) cycles of the 1st order rectangle,

with  sides  of  length  ½Rln(π/2)  and  ½Rlnπ,  which  is  also  covered  by  the  noncompact  two-

dimensional extra space. The distance from (0, 0) to the 2nd order intersection (99.5, 39.25), the

position of which corresponds to the quark mass scale of Standard Model Family 2, equals the

length of 99.5 (1, 0) cycles, 39.25 (0, 1) cycles and 36.5 (1, 1) cycles of the principal rectangle.

The  fractional  numbers  of  (0,  1)  and  (1,  1)  cycles,  up  to  the  point  of  the  intersection,  can  be
interpreted as integer numbers of (0, 1) and (1, 1) cycles of the 2nd order rectangle, with sides of

length ¼Rln(π/2) and ¼Rlnπ, which is also covered by the noncompact two-dimensional extra

space.  Similarly,  we  can  interpret  3rd  order  intersections  as  the  intersections,  in  the  covering
space, of 1-cycles winding around the 3rd order rectangle.

1-cycles winding around the (1, 0) and (0, 1) cycles of the principal rectangle and a hierarchy of

rectangular  subspaces  meet,  upon  the  line  y  =  z  in  the  covering  space,  in  intersections  upon

which the natural scales are the scales of the Standard Model.

4   The intersecting brane world

We have shown that the three families of quarks are associated with the intersections (109, 43),

(99.5, 39.25) and (90, 35.5). The hadrons and the weak gauge bosons are also associated with

domain  wall  intersections  in  the  noncompact  extra  space,  and  therefore  with  the  orthogonal

intersections of 1-cycles winding around the compact spaces of the  model. 4-branes wrapping

the 1-cycles intersect orthogonally in 3-branes, upon which the particles propagate. The neutral

hadrons  π0,  K0,  φ  and  Λb

0,  and  the  exotic  baryon  θ+,  are  located  adjacent  to  the  intersections

(101.75, 40.125), (98.875, 39), (97.25, 38.375), (93.5, 36.875) and (96.375, 38), respectively, as

shown in Figure 3. Each of these hadrons appears to lie precisely upon a low order domain wall

in one direction, and upon a high order domain wall  in  the  other  direction.  Other  hadrons  are
associated with the intersections of domain walls of higher order. For example, K*0 is located
adjacent to the intersection of domain walls of 4th and 1st order.

Groups of particles are also associated with the intersections of low order domain walls in the

noncompact extra space. The groups πo - π±, K± - K0, ρ - ω, Λ - Σ0 and W± - Z0 are centred on

locations  adjacent  to  the  intersections  (101.75,  40.125),  (98.875,  39),  (97.875,  38.625),  (97,

38.25) and (87.5, 34.5), respectively, as shown in Figure 4.

Abstract 

There are many subtle issues associated with solving the Navier-Stokes equations.  In this 

paper, several of these issues, which have been observed previously in research involving 

the Navier-Stokes equations, are studied within the framework of the one-dimensional 

Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, a model nonlinear partial-differential equation.  

This alternative approach is expected to more easily expose major points and hopefully 

identify open questions that are related to the Navier-Stokes equations.  In particular, four 

interesting issues are discussed.  The first is related to the difficulty in defining regions of 

linear stability and instability for a time-dependent governing parameter; this is 

equivalent to a time-dependent base flow for the Navier-Stokes equations.  The next two 

issues are consequences of nonlinear interactions.  These include the evolution of the 

solution by exciting its harmonics (Fourier components) in the presence of a constant or a 

time-dependent governing parameter; and the sensitivity of the long-time solution to 

initial conditions.  The final issue is concerned with the lack of convergent numerical 

chaotic solutions, an issue that has not been previously studied for the Navier-Stokes 

equations.  Conclusions and questions uncovered by the numerical results are discussed.  

The reasons behind each issue are provided with the expectation that they will stimulate 

interest in further study. 

1.  Introduction. 

It is well known that many difficult phenomena associated with the Navier-Stokes 

equations are subtle and subject to different interpretations.  In this regard, four issues are 

of interest here.  The first is a linear-stability analysis for a time-dependent governing 

parameter; the next two are related to nonlinear interactions; and the last is concerned 

 

1

with the lack of convergent numerical chaotic solutions. The understanding of these 

issues is not straightforward since no general analytical solutions exist.  The purpose of 

this paper is to communicate the results of some recent progress on these issues and other 

related matters that are the results of a study of a model partial different equation, the 

one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation.  Hopefully, this simple model 

equation will help to clarify the role of nonlinear terms and their consequences.  The 

spectral method used to solve the KS equation is described in section 2.   

In section 3, it is shown that a linear-stability analysis for an unsteady governing 

parameter can be carried out by a direct numerical integration of the linearized 

differential equations to find its critical state, the boundary between stable and unstable 

states.  Such an approach is equivalent to the classical linear-stability analysis, which 

calculates eigenvalues when the parameter is a constant.  In a benchmark paper, Hall [2] 

used this direct method to analyze the linear spatial instability of developing Taylor-

Görtler vortices.   

The next two issues involve the behaviors of solutions when the value of the governing 

parameter is above the critical state; in this case, nonlinear interactions among 

disturbances of non-zero amplitudes become important.  Such behaviors are the key 

factors in the understanding of various transition processes in fluid flows.  Classical 

treatments of nonlinear interactions can be traced to the pioneering efforts of Landau [5], 

Stuart [9], and Watson [10] for shear flows, and Philips [6] for water waves.  In section 

4a, it is shown that a linearly stable or unstable initial condition always excites the entire 

set of harmonics appearing in its Fourier components, no matter how small their 

amplitudes.  Consequently, at the critical state, the solution is nonlinearly stable since the 

influence of the linear term vanishes for the critical wave, which can transfer energy 

simultaneously to its dissipative harmonics.  Another natural consequence is that a single-

wave (Fourier component) solution does not exist for a non-linear partial differential 

equation since the entire set of harmonics is excited.  This result provides a simple 

explanation as to why a long wave can trigger many short waves simultaneously, and 

why energy is not necessarily transferred from long waves to short waves in cascade.   

 

2

It has been previously demonstrated [13, 14] that the nonlinear terms of the Navier-

Stokes equations can be interpreted as forced and resonant vibrations, and can induce 

“energy” transfer among waves.  Here energy is expressed by the square of the wave 

amplitude.  These ideas appear originally in the pioneering work of Phillips [6] for water 

waves.  Since forced vibrations do not cause significant transfer of energy among 

individual waves, they do not change the spatial structure of the solution.  However, they 

do excite all wave harmonics, thereby providing a starting point for resonant energy 

transfers.  In contrast, the energy transferred due to resonance is substantial, and can lead 

to observable changes in the solution structure.  Consequently, the energy transfer 

associated with the nonlinear terms cannot be ignored as long as wave amplitudes are not 

zero.  Examples are presented in sections 4a and 4b to illustrate the existence of such 

behaviors for the KS equations when the governing parameter is constant (4a) or time-

dependent (4b).  These numerical results also show that the energy can be transferred to 

sub-harmonics. 

In section 4c, examples are used to show that the long-time solutions of the KS equation 

at a fixed parameter value are sensitive to initial conditions.  Previous work has shown 

that such behavior exists for the Navier-Stokes equations [2, 12, 13].  This suggests that 

the classical principle of “dynamic similarity” is strictly valid only if the governing 

parameter is below its critical value. 

The final issue involves the non-convergence of numerical computations for values of the 

parameters that allow chaotic solutions for the KS equation.  Rössler [7] first noted this 

issue while commenting on the numerical approximation of the chaotic solution of the 

celebrated Rössler system of three ordinary differential equations.  In section 5, it is 

shown that no convergent, long-time numerical chaotic solution can be found by all time-

discrete methods and time steps tested in this study.  The lack of convergent 

computational results for chaos has also been found for the Lorenz system [15].  This 

leads to an interesting question: Is it possible to obtain a convergent direct numerical 

turbulent solution of the much more complicated Navier-Stokes equations?

individual wave energies.  Since the wave corresponding to n = 0 does not interact with 

any others, as is common, it is not included in this discussion.

This system shows that energy transfers can occur from small to large wave numbers 

(small to large n) in sequence, which is an energy cascade.  However, this cascade is only 

one of many possible nonlinear energy-transfer mechanisms; moreover, it is not 

necessarily the dominant one.  This conclusion is also valid for the Navier-Stokes 

equations since they take on a similar structure to (3) when expressed in terms of a 

suitable problem-dependent version of the expansion in (2) [14]. 

 

4

A large number of computations for (3) have demonstrated that energy transfers usually 

occur from high-amplitude waves to low-amplitude waves, but the transfers do not 

always follow this “rule.”  Otherwise, this discrete system is similar to the discrete 

system for the amplitude-density functions of a Fourier-eigenfunction spectral method for 

the Navier-Stokes equations [2, 12, 13], which suggests that the solution properties 

studied in this paper are relevant to those of the Navier-Stokes equations. 

  Two different time-integration methods are used for the temporal discretization of (3).  

The first method, which will be referred to as the explicit method, approximates the non-

linear terms by an explicit second-order-accurate Adams-Bashforth method and the linear 

terms by an implicit Crank-Nicholson method.  The second method, which will be 

referred to as the implicit method, uses a second-order Crank-Nicholson method for both 

nonlinear and linear terms.  A careful comparison of many numerical computations show 

that N = 32 is sufficient for the examples of this paper. 

3.  Linear Stability Analysis 

Like in the well-studied linear hydrodynamic stability, the linear terms of (3) represent 

the difference between energy production and dissipation.  If this difference has a 

positive value, then a mode grows after being excited and is classified as linearly 

unstable.  Ignoring the nonlinear terms in (3), the amplitude functions An can be easily 

determined.  This leads to the following conclusion.  The linear-stability boundary can be 

determined by the condition dAn/dt = 0, even with λ time-dependent.  This states that a 

wave is linearly unstable when the time derivative of its amplitude is positive or linearly 

stable when it is negative.  This is consistent with the traditional linear stability analysis 

of hydrodynamics of steady bases flows that computes eigenvalues.  The advantage of 

directly solving an initial-value problem to determine the sign of dAn/dt is that this 

approach is not limited to problems with a constant λ or a steady base flow.  Its weakness 

is that it may require assuming initial values for the dependent variables in order to carry 

out the computation for more complex equations such as the Navier-Stokes equations.  

Hall [2] used this direct method to analyze the linear spatial instability of developing 

Taylor-Görtler vortices, and resolved several controversies.  For the KS equation, the 

 

5

linear-stability analysis is trivial, and the stability boundary can be determined by either 
an eigenvalue method or a direct method:  An is neutrally stable at λ = 4n2. 

4.  Nonlinear Stability Analysis 

4a. Constant λ 

The first nonlinear case considered uses λ = 4, for which the wave A1 is neutrally stable 

according to a linear-stability analysis.  The initial condition is A1 = 1, with all other 

amplitudes zero.  The time step is 0.001 and N=32.  It has been shown that the non-linear 

terms represent many wave resonances and are not just limited to resonant trios [12].  

Results obtained with the implicit method showing that the energy transfers from A1 to its 

harmonics occur simultaneously are displayed in Figure 1.  The energy transfer from A1 

causes the initial growth of all harmonics.  All waves start to slowly decay after 60 time 

steps, as shown in Figure 2.  Consequently, the critical wave is not neutrally stable at the 

critical point if non-linear effects are considered. 

On the other hand, results obtained by the explicit method show an energy cascade in 

Figure 1.  In agreement with the resonance conditions associated with nonlinear wave-

interactions [6, 15], at the first time step A2 starts to grow; at the second time step, A3 and 

A4 are excited, and so forth.  These numerical results are incorrect initially because they 

are only functions of the number of integration time-steps, and not of the time, as shown 

in Figure 1.  The initially incorrect results of the explicit method eventually coincide with 

the convergent ones of the implicit method.  This time delay in transferring energy from 

small to large wave numbers can be traced to the limitations of the explicit method for 

nonlinear differential equations.  Comparing the results of the computations for the 

explicit and implicit methods shows that there is a small time delay in the response of 

short waves as predicted by the explicit method in the presence of an initial condition that 

favors long waves.  Thus, an implicit scheme may be more attractive for unsteady 

nonlinear problems. 

The next example presented in Figure 3 shows that energy can transfer to sub-harmonics 

when the resonant conditions are satisfied.  The value of l is 4, the initial conditions are 

 

6

A2 = A3 =1, with all others zero.  The computational time-step is set at 

∆ =t

510−

and 

N = 40 in order to show clearly its quick development for small time.  The results show 

that A1 gains energy initially from its harmonics since it is neutrally stable at l = 4. 

4b. Time-Dependent λ 

For cases in which λ is a function of time, solutions may reflect a wide range of the 

governing parameter.  In the following examples, 

40tλ=

is selected, with N=50 and 

∆ = x

6
5 10 ,−

t

 in order to obtain convergent results.  The results for an initial amplitude A1 

= 1, with all other amplitudes zero, are given in Figure 4.  Initially, the amplitude of A1 

decreases because this mode is linearly neutrally stable until λ becomes larger than 4.  

The important non-linear effect is that A1 produces and transfers energy to its entire range 

of harmonics, demonstrating that these effects can generate harmonics almost 

instantaneously.  The initial amplitudes of the harmonics of A1 are very small, but, when 

they become unstable, they grow quickly as indicated by the linear terms of equation (3).  

Different waves become dominant as the value of λ increases in time.  

After t = 4, the computed results becomes chaotic, and no convergent computational 

results can be obtained.  This topic is the subject of the next section.  It is interesting to 

note that the computed result becomes non-chaotic again after t ~ 5.  This agrees with 

previous studies showing that the KS equation has several narrow windows for λ that 

allow chaos [4].   

The second unsteady case has A2 = 1, with all other amplitudes zero, at t = 0.  The results 

are plotted in figure 5.  Initially A2 decreases, but then increases when it becomes 

unstable according to the linear-stability analysis as λ increases beyond 16 at t = 0.4.  The 

initial energy transfers from A2 to A4, A6, etc. occur simultaneously.  After t = 0.4, the 

amplitudes of all waves start to increase due to the fact that A2 becomes unstable and has 

more energy, which can be transferred to other waves.  This is why the evolution of the 

amplitudes of all even waves is almost the same as the evolution of A2 initially.  No odd 

waves are excited in this example since they are not harmonics of A2 and their initial 

amplitudes are zero.   

 

7

These cases demonstrate an important non-linear effect showing that any disturbance can 

produce its entire range of harmonics.  This is a fast seeding process and does not occur 

slowly in sequence.  As a result, some of the induced waves may become unstable and 

lead to a transition from stable behavior to chaos.  Unfortunately, no convergent 

computed results can be found once transition starts; this topic will be addressed in the 

next section.  Since a wave can simultaneously transfer energy to its entire set of 

harmonics, a long disturbance wave can trigger short waves.  The well-known Tollmien-

Schlichting waves of boundary-layer instability are an example of such a natural non-

linear process.   

4c. Sensitivity to Initial Conditions 

Another important observation already apparent in Figures 4 and 5 is that computed 

results are sensitive to initial conditions.  To pursue this property more fully, two cases 

with a fixed value of λ = 17 are plotted in Figures 6 and 7 to demonstrate the existence of 

multiple equilibrium solutions.  The integration time-step is set at 10-4 and N=64.  When λ 

= 17, the first two waves are unstable.  In Figure 6, the initial condition is A1 = 0, A2 =0.1, 
with all remaining waves having amplitudes set at 10-5.  Since A3 is stable and its initial 
amplitude is 10-5, energy is transferred to it via resonance.  After A3 gains energy, it can 

resonant with A2 and A3 to transfer energy to A1.  This is an example of reverse energy 

transfer to subharmonics.  If the initial condition is changed to A2 = 0.1, with all others 

zero, then only even waves will be excited.   

The case plotted in Figure 7 has a slightly different initial condition (A1 = 10-5) from the 

case plotted in Figure 6.   Since the initial amplitude of A1 is not exactly zero, A1 gains 

energy linearly because it is unstable at λ = 17.  These two figures clearly indicate that 

slightly different initial conditions can lead to different equilibrium solutions.  This 

shows that stable long-time solutions can be sensitive to initial conditions without 

necessarily being chaotic solutions.  These results imply the existence of different 

domains of attraction.  The starting point of a computation within a particular domain of 

attraction determines the particular position of the final numerical solution.  Testing 

many cases with slightly different initial conditions leads to the conclusion that infinitely 

 

8

many long-time periodic solutions can exist for a given λ.  Consequently, a rich variety of 

long-time solutions can be expected.   

The existence of multiple long-time flows is widely recognized for certain problems in 

fluid mechanics.  Coles [1] and Snyder [8], in benchmark papers, demonstrated that these 

flows depend on the initial conditions for a given final Taylor number in Taylor-Couette 

flows.  The essence of their observations has been confirmed by recent direct numerical 

solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations [2, 12].  Similar numerical results are available 

for the totally different physical example of mixed convection in a vertical annulus [13].  

This work establishes the possibility that a instability can lead to multiple solutions.  If 

this is so, initial conditions might be additional factors to be considered in the application 

of the principle of dynamic similarity.   

The question of extending this conclusion to turbulence lacks consensus.  Indeed, this is a 

very difficult question to answer experimentally.  Unfortunately, its answer is also 

beyond the scope of current numerical methods.  The reason is described in the next 

section.   

5. Chaos 

It has been shown that the numerical solution of the KS equation is chaotic for λ  = 69 

[4].  The results presented in this section are computed with N = 64.  A computation with 

the initial condition of a single non-zero wave, with the remaining waves at zero, 

indicates that the numerical solution is not chaotic.  If the initial amplitudes of the 

linearly unstable waves corresponding to n = 1 to 4 are set to a small number, then the 

numerical solution becomes chaotic.  Once such computed solutions become chaotic, 

they are time-step sensitive and break down after a very short time, about t

≥

0.41

.  The 

results presented in Figures 8 and 9 are obtained with the initial amplitude of all waves 
set at 10-5.  Since the difference between the production and dissipation for A3 has a 

maximum value at λ = 69 and its shape is representative, only A3 is plotted.   

The time history of A3 obtained by the explicit method is plotted in Figure 8 for five 

different values of ∆t.  The numerical result grows without bound for ∆t > 0.0007.  

 

9

Reduction of the time step to 10-4 extends the convergent solution from t = 0.2 to t = 0.4.  

Further reduction of ∆t to a value smaller than 10-4 does not improve the results.  The 

solution becomes time-step sensitive after t = 0.4.  Several different numerical methods 

(Adam-Bashforth methods up to the fifth order; the implicit method mentioned in section 

3; fourth-order Runge-Kutta method; and other methods involving variable time steps) 

did not yield a convergent solution.

in Figure 9 shows that the time-averaged solutions also depend on the time-step.  The 

case labeled FFT in Figure 9 is obtained by a pseudo-spectral method.  This spectrum is 

an important statistical property for chaos, and cannot be a function of the integration 

time-step used in obtaining it; otherwise the integration time-step becomes an additional 

artificial problem parameter without a physical meaning. 

The lack of convergence in the results of Figures 8 and 9 is, at first glance, unexpected.  

Attempts to justify this behavior frequently rely on two generic properties of chaos.  

However, such arguments cannot withstand careful scrutiny, as is discussed in the 

following two paragraphs.  A plausible explanation closes this section.  

Argument 1:  Since a necessary property of chaos is that it has a positive Liapunov 

exponent, or a positive nonlinear exponential growth-rate, the truncation error introduced 

by various numerical methods can be amplified exponentially.  Hence, erroneous 

solutions develop differently due to different truncation errors.  This is equivalent to 

saying that the finite-difference equations, which approximate the differential equations, 

are unstable.  This argument may be correct in general, but is not valid uniformly in the 

entire geometric space [10, 15].  This is because problem-dependent numerical solutions 

can be locally stable or unstable; such solutions are rarely uniformly unstable in the entire 

geometric space.  

Argument 2:  It is well known that chaotic solutions of differential equations are sensitive 

to initial conditions.  The different truncation errors associated with different integration 

 

10

time-steps, in effect, lead to a series of modified initial conditions for later times.  

Consequently, computed chaotic solutions are integration time-step dependent, and 

cannot be considered to be an approximate, in any sense, solution of the differential 

equations.  On the other hand, as demonstrated in section 4c, stable long-time flows are 

also sensitive to initial conditions but all computed solutions are convergent and 

independent of the integration time-steps. 

A recent study [15] showed that any numerical errors, no matter how small, in the 

numerical solution of the Lorenz system of differential equations can be amplified 

dramatically.  This is due to the fact that these equations are not a “hyperbolic” system 

and have a finite number of singularities [10].  The inset of a singular point (a collection 

of points such that all trajectories starting at those points travel toward the singular point) 

forms a local (virtual) “separatrix” (a finite surface separating two regions in a geometric 

space).  From a geometric viewpoint, any trajectory touching a virtual separatrix will 

approach the singular point asymptotically; thus, a solution trajectory cannot penetrate a 

separatrix.  The breakdown of the numerical computations is a consequence of the fact 

that a small numerical error can force the trajectory to penetrate the virtual “separatrix,” 

hence, violating the uniqueness theory for differential equations.  This behavior can cause 

a dramatic amplification of numerical errors, and can occur repeatedly.  It would be 

worthwhile to study whether this is a generic mechanism for inducing numerical errors in 

all chaotic differential equations.

6.  Conclusions 

It is noteworthy that the simple one-dimensional KS equation, as a model, contains 

considerable information closely related to many important problems that have been 

extensively studied in fluid dynamics.  Since the required analysis for the KS equation is 

relatively simple, the computed results can be interpreted more readily than the more 

complex Navier-Stokes equations.   

The conclusions of this paper are outlined in the following remarks, with reference to the 

four issues identified in section 1.  It is significant to note that the conclusions for the first 

three issues are also valid, at least in some problems, for the Navier-Stokes equations: 

1.  The linear-stability boundary can be identified by a direct numerical integration of the 

linearized differential equation for either a steady or a time-dependent parameter.   

2.  A small disturbance can excite the entire set of Fourier components instantaneously 

so that, while the effect of nonlinear interactions may be small initially, they can 

determine the long-time evolution of the solutions.   

3.  There are multiple stable long-time solutions dependent on the imposed initial 

conditions beyond the onset of instability.   

4.  Current discrete numerical methods can compute solutions beyond the onset of 

instability very efficiently as long as they are not chaotic.  This issue has not been 

addressed for the Navier-Stokes equations.

Figure 3. The value of lis 4, so A1 is neutrally stable and other waves are stable.  The 
initial condition is A1 = A2 =1 and other waves are zero.  The results show A1 
gain energy from A2 and A3 initially.  This is an example of reverse resonant 
energy transfer that energy is transferred to sub-harmonics when the resonant 
conditions are satisfied.

Figure 4.  The initial amplitude of A1=1 and λ=40t.  The entire harmonics of A1 are 
excited.  The initial increase of A2 is completely due to resonant energy 
transfer  from  A1.    The  wave  A1  starts  to  decrease  after  A2  becomes 
unstable at λ=16.   This example shows that a long-wave disturbance can 
excite  a  full  spectral  of  disturbances  by  non-linearly  producing  its 
harmonics.  Only the first 12 waves are plotted.

Figure 5.  The initial amplitude of the wave A2 =1 and λ=40t.  Only the first 20 waves are 

plotted.  No odd number waves are excited since their initial amplitudes are 
zero.  All harmonics of A2 grow almost simultaneously initially

Figure  6.    The  value  of  λ  is  17,  so  the  first  two  waves  are  unstable.  The  initial 
amplitude  of  A1=0,  A2=0.1  and  the  amplitude  of  the  rest  waves  is  set  at 
10-5.    Since  A3  is  stable  and  its  initial  amplitude  is  10-5,  the  energy  is 
transferred to it via resonance.  Then A3 transfer energy to A1 resonantly.  
This  is  a  reverse  transfer  to  subharmonics.    If  the  initial  condition  is 
A2=0.1 and all other waves are zero, then only even waves will be excited.

Figure  7.    The  value  of  λ  is  17,  so  the  first  two  waves  are  unstable.  The  initial 
amplitude  of  A2=0.1  and  the  amplitude  of  the  rest  waves  is  set  at  10-5.  
Since  the  initial  amplitude  of  A1  is  not  exact  zero,  the  increase  of  A1  is 
due to it is unstable.  The solutions of Figures 5 and 6 are obviously not 
same  due  small  difference  of  the  initial  conditions,  even  though  the  λ 
values of two cases are same.

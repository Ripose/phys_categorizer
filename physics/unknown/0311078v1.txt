The  non-stationary  nonlinear  models  of  magnetostatic  waves 
propagation  in  layered  ferromagnetic structures are developed. This  models 
are  based  on  use  of  the  coupled  nonlinear  Schrodinger  equations  for 
amplitude  of  a  bending  around  taking  into  account  an  electrodynamic 
coupling between layers. The basic nonlinear processes in such structures, in 
particular, the  effects  of  self-modulation  and  solitons  formation  are  studied 
numerically,  in  comparison  with  the  similar  effects  in  single  ferromagnetic 
films. 

1.  To  the  present  time  nonlinear  self-influence  processes  (self-modulation,  self-
focusing,  formation  of  envelope  solitons  etc.)  in  one-film  ferromagnetic  structures  are 
investigated  in  detail,  both  theoretically  and  experimentally  for  different  types  of 
magnetostatic  waves  (MSW)  [1].  The  wide  possibilities  for  research  of  the  indicated 
nonlinear effects present multilayer ferromagnetic structures, which can include as layers 
of  a  different  physical  nature  [2],  so  and  several  ferromagnetic  films  [3-4].  The  linear 
wave  processes  in  multilayer  ferromagnetic  structures  are  investigated  enough.  The 
coupling influence on nonlinear wave processes in multilayer ferromagnetic structures can 
result  in  a  modification  not  only  a  dispersion  low  of  magnetostatic  waves,  but  also  
nonlinearity of a system.  

The  present  report  is  devoted  to  a  numerical  modeling  of  self-influence  processes, 
which  is  accompanied  by  a  modulation  instability,  as  applied  to  structure  consisting  of 
two  ferromagnetic  layers.  We    study  the  features  of  these  nonlinear  processes  in 
comparison with similar in single films. The special attention is given to a problem, which 
is  connected  with  a  pulse  propagation  in  similar  structure  and  possibility  of  envelope 
«solitons»  formation.  The  propagation  of  continuous  signals  in  similar  structures,  being 
accompanied  with  a  self-modulation  of  a  signal,  is  also  considered  for  different  type  of 
excitation  of  system  on  distances  there  is  a  lot  of  smaller  length  of  linear  swapping  of 
energy between layers. 

 
2. The analysis was conducted with reference to ferromagnetic structure consisting of 
0M , 
two identical  ferromagnetic  layers by the width  D, with a  saturation  magnetization 
separated by a dielectric  layer of width d. The considered structure is  infinite  in x and y 
direction,  the  constant  magnetic  field  H0  is  enclosed  on  a  normal  in  a  surface  of  layers, 
that  corresponds  to  distribution  of  forward  volume  MSW  in  ferromagnetic  layers 
(FVMSW).  The  coefficient  of  coupling  between  layers  is  determined  as  exp[-kd].  In  a 
layered structure the dispersing curve for a single film, is decomposed on two, appropriate

In assumption of the electrodynamics coupling of a high-frequency fields in a coupled

3.  The  main  results  obtained  on  the  basis  of  a  numerical  solution  of  a  system  of 

equations (1) are reduced to the following: 

!  When  is  injected  signals  of  equal  amplitude  in  coupled  films  (in  a  phase  or 
antiphase) the wave in a system can be both stable, or unstable of rather small longitudinal 
envelope perturbations;  in a  single  film  FVMSW  is always unstable. The given effect is 
connected with a changing of a sign of  normal modes dispersion (fig.1). Since for given 
type of excitation, the system (1) is degenerated  in 2 disconnected equations  for each of 
normal modes; the Lighthill criterion is not satisfied, for example, in the areas II and IV, 
in which FVMSW in a coupled system are stable. 
! The  nonlinear  nature  of  coupling  in  structure  is  reveals  itself  in  following:  at 
excitement  of  one  of  the  films,  the  signal  of  large  amplitude  is  divided  between 
coupled films, the signal of small amplitude is not redistributed between films (fig.2). 
The  division  of  a  signal  has  a  place  on  length  of  structure,  which  is  inversely 
proportional to power of an input signal and depends on distance between films.  

Under pulsed excitement of structure: 
! When  is  injected  signal  in  one  of  the  coupled  films  of  structure  a  velocity  and 
amplitude  of  soliton-like  formation  on  receive  antenna  is  more,  than  in  a  single  line 
and  increases  in  accordance  with    the  films  convergence  in  structure  (increasing  of 
coupling). That is connected with change the velocities of normal waves depending on 
coupling (fig.1) and simultaneous influence of losses. 

! At  excitation  of  one  film  in  coupled  structure  the  splitting  of  an  input  pulse  is 
observed,  as  against  a  single  line.  Thus,  using  electrodynamics  coupling  between 
magnetostatic waves, is possible to control processes of a soliton-like pulse formation 
in multilayer ferromagnetic structures. 
At excitement of system by continuous signal: 
! Under  inphase  or  antiphase  excitement  of  coupled  structure  a  decreasing  of 
«threshold» value of an input amplitude, necessary for existence of a self-modulation 
in system, in comparison with appropriate «threshold» value without of coupling, has 
a place.

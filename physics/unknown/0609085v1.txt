A  new  and  rather  independent  research  field  is  now  emerging  on  intermodalism,  because  
intermodalism,  that  is  the  intermodal  transportation,  must  study  the  behavior  of    systems    different  
from  single-mode  transport  systems.  In  fact,  the  importance  of  this  new  research  field,  its  potential 
interdisciplinary  of  modeling  the  problem  with  the  science  of  complex    networks,  are    not  yet 
completely appreciated by the scientific community. This is due to several reasons, among others the 
lack  of  a  common  background  and    a  rather  cumbersome  approach  of  operation  research  to  the 
modeling of  transportation.
In  this  paper  we  review  the  concept  of  intermodalism  and      the  approach  to  intermodalism    in  the 
operation  research  field.  Then  we  discuss  the  intermodal  networks  in  the  framework  of  real  world 
networks to understand  the behavior of  intermodal systems as a whole.

INTRODUCTION

 

 

is 

to 

the  natural  answer 

Intermodal transportation, or intermodalism for 
short, 
the 
requirements for moving  people or cargoes. It 
can  be  viewed  as    a  consequence  of  the 
existing  social,  marketing  and  distribution 
connections and,  at the same time, as a source 
of new and more wider connections [1-3].
The  term  “intermodalism”  gained  currency 
when  the  marketing  advantages  of  a  transport 
network  based  on  different  size  carriers  with 
global    alliances  and  strategies  turned  the  
intermodal 
into  an 
transportation 
system  - 
trailer-sized 
in  particular  when 
containers  began  to  be  widely  used.  Until  the 
introduction  of  modern  containerization,  the 
process  of 
freights  between 
different  modes    of  transportation    remained 
substantially unchanged. Containerization, that 
is the use of common containers with common 

transferring 

industry

shipping  documents  and 
tracking,  uses  a 
seamless  transport  network    moving  freight 
from    origin  to  destination  in  a  continuous 
pattern.
If  the    level  of  disjunction  between  modes  is 
high,  freight  transportation  can  be  described 
and  modeled  in  terms  of  the  separate  modes, 
rather  than  by  the  common  activities  at  the 
interface between modes. In fact, each mode of 
transportation has its different network model. 
But 
  networks  cannot  be  considered  as 
independent    when  they  are  highly  integrated 
and then new intermodal network models must 
be developed.
As  pointed  out  by  A.  Donovan  [4],    the  term 
“intermodalism”  was at the beginning used to 
describe  a  transportation  system  composed  of 
modes  whose  differences  are  more  important 
than  their  common  concerns.  But  today  it  is 
used not to emphasize  the differences between 
the modes but rather a highly integrated system 

2

with different manifolds.  The evolution of the 
contemporary industry of transportation  into a 
comprehensive  system  is  definitively  moving 
beyond modalism to intermodalism.
Let  us  start  with  a  survey  of  operation 
researches  on  intermodalism.  Then  we  will 
discuss  the  most  recent  idea  on  modeling 
which  networks  the  routing  on  freights  and 
passengers.

research 

Studies  on  transportation  systems  are  still 
under  the  domain  of  operations  research.  In 
this  research  area,  the  rather  independent 
research  field  on  intermodalism  is  emerging 
because the intermodal transportation system is 
intrinsically  different 
from  single-mode 
transport  systems  [5].    The  importance  of  this 
new  research  field  and  its  interdisciplinary, 
such  as the possibility of  modeling it  with the 
science  of  complex  systems  and  networks,  is, 
in fact,  not yet completely appreciated.
To 
on 
effective, 
intermodalism  needs  a  common  ground 
terminology that is still lacking. Each transport 
mode has its own terminology  persisting in the 
operation  of  the  current  transportation  system 
with  limited  coordination  in  the  development 
of  intermodalism  [5,6].  The  use  of  a  different 
terminology    hinders  a  faster  development  of 
integrated models.
Four modes of transportation carry freight and 
passengers:  water,  air,  rail  and  road.  Water 
transport  moves  bulk  cargo  and  passengers  at 
limited  speeds  to  limited  destinations.   Air 
transport  rapidly  moves  cargo  and  passengers 
in  limited  quantities  and  numbers  to  limited 
large 
destinations.  Rail 
quantities of  cargo  over land  routes to  limited 
destinations.   Road transport  moves  cargo  and 
passengers  to  virtually  any  destination  in 
limited  quantities.  Each  mode  is  developed 
independently.  And  if  the  connections  among 
the modes is limited, each transportation mode 
has  its  own  network  model.  From  the  above  
description  of  mode  characteristics, 
is 
evident  that  air  and  water  transport  have 
networks  with  a  limited  low  number  of  nodes

research,  a  scientific  discipline  dealing  with 
the problems of   methods for decision making, 
that  is  developing  models  for  transportation.
In  [8,9],    literature  reviews  of    mathematical 
modeling  of    intermodal  transportation  are 
given.  Ship  terminal  models  dominate  the 
intermodal freight literature [10-13]. In  [10], a

Statistical  or  deterministic  inputs  have  been 
used  in  [19]  to    simulate    the  flow  among 
intermodal terminal units in a rail-road system 
where  intermodal  terminals  are  connected  by 
rail corridors. From a survey of the literature, it 
is evident that the  operation research approach 
is  not    discussing  the  statistic  nature  of  the 
network involved in transportation.

3.  PERFORMANCES, 
COMPLEXITIES OF  MODELS

ISSUES  AND 

From  an  operations  research  approach  to 
intermodal  systems,  the  intermodal  system  is 
viewed  as  a  collection  of  items  that  act 
together  toward  the  accomplishment  of  some 
end.  A  model of  the  system  is  developed as  a 
simplified  representation  of  a  system.  Besides  
iconic and analog models, symbolic model are  
used  to  analyze  the  behavior  of  the    system.
Iconic  models  are  scaled models  of  the  actual 
(real) systems and analog models are  physical 
models    used  to  describe  the  original  system 
(for  instance,  the  use  of  electrical  circuits  to 
model thermal conductivity). Symbolic models 
are   often referred to  as mathematical  models, 
because the system behavior is described using 
only  equations  and 
relationships 
[20,21].
In these models, variables and parameters must 
be  carefully  chosen.  Variables,  or  decision 
variables, are   those quantities over which the 
system manager has a control, often limited by 
constraints.   Parameters are values over which 
control. 
the 
Performance  measures  are  quantities 
that 
capture  the  level  to  which  the  system  is 
operating.  Examples of performance measures 
are  equipment utilization, operating costs, and 
so  on.   An  objective  function  identifies  an

the 
optimization  goal  (maximize  or  minimize)  for 
the  measure.   For  example,  an  objective 
function  may  minimize  operating  costs  or 
maximize the profit.  In a mathematical model, 
decision  variables,  parameters,  constraints, 
performance measures, and objective functions 
are all captured using equations and/or logical 
relationships.   The  transportation  terms  are 
needed  to  complete  the  terminology  base  for 
modeling intermodal transportation systems.  
There are many issues that must be considered 
when  addressing 
transportation 
routing.  First  of  all,  the  fixed  and  variable 
transportation  costs  are  different 
in  each 
transportation mode. In the intermodalism,  the 
model must consider not only the cost for each 
different mode, but also the transfer cost from 
mode  to  mode  and  the  transfer  time.  Transfer 
costs  depend  upon  the  transfer  point  at  which 
they occur  [22].  In the  model then, costs and 
times  are  represented  by  means  of  functions 
which must be  minimized of maximized. 
transportation 
When  modeling 
systems,  various 
the 
representation  of  the  reality  of  the  system.  
One  factor  to  be  investigated  by  a  modeler  is 
the  consideration  of  single  or  multiple  routes 
between shipment origin and destination. With 
each  additional  path  considered,  the  modeler 
must face a large increase in the complexity of 
model  behavior.  Assuming  that  there  are    a 
number of modes available at each city  in the 
transportation network, transport of passengers 
or  freights  from  the  starting  point  to  the 
destination will have several possible paths on 
a network. 
The main issue of an intermodal transportation  
lies  in  minimizing    the  overall  transportation 
cost.    This  cost  can  be  estimated  adding  the 
equipment and crew costs, overhead costs, and 
general  and  administration  costs.  Sometimes, 
in 
multiple  objectives  must  be 
modeling. That   is,   for   instance,   not   only 
minimizing  total  cost,  but  also  minimizing 
total  time and/or  maximizing the  service  level 
and social benefits.  A possible approach is to 
weight  the  different  objectives  based  on  their 
importance  [23-25].  One  of  the    objectives  of 
developing

methodologies  to  select  the  best  combination 
of  transportation  modes  to  move  a  shipment 
from  an  origin 
including 
transfer  costs  between  modes.  The  goal    is  to 
obtain a  decision support system for real-time 
routing  of  shipments  through  an  intermodal 
network. 
A  report  about  the  studies  on  transportation 
problems  with  operative  programs  is  rather 
wide  and  dispersive.  We  prefer  avoiding 
deeper  descriptions  of    these  studies  and 
devote our attention to networks, starting with 
a simple problem related to transportation; that 
is, the problem of the shortest path.

Fixing  our  attention  on  the    network,  the

primary  problem 
between the nodes of the network to determine 
possible paths from origin to destination and to 
define  costs  functions  for  each  path.  In  the 
network,  cities  are  represented  by  nodes,  and 
routes  are  represented  by  links  between  the 
nodes.    The  distances  of  these  links  represent 
transportation  cost  or  time  as  opposed  to  the 
traditional  linear  distance  in  miles.  Single  or 
multiple routes between  origin and destination 
are  possible.  Each  additional  node  or  path 
increases the complexity of the model. 
One of the main problems in the modeling and 
analysis of  transportation and communication 
networks  is  to  find  the  shortest  path  for  the 
lowest  cost  of 
  transportation.    It  could 
desirable,  however,  to  determine  not  only  the 
shortest path through a network, but to identify 
several sets  of  paths on the network where the 
choice  is  dependent  upon  multiple  objectives 
or  special circumstances [26-28]. 
In  the  modeling  of  transportation    involving 
multiple  modes  between  each  node  of  the  
two  manners  of  approach  are 
network, 
possible. One way is to represent a node in the 
network  once  for  each  mode  of  transportation 
that can enter that city.  For example, if a city 
has three modes of transportation  available to 
enter  the  city,  the  city  is  represented  by  three 
nodes.  Then,  there  is    only  one  link  between 
each  pair  of  nodes  in  this  modeling  method.  

Each  link  corresponds  to  the  transportation 
cost  of  the  mode  represented  by  the  node  to 
which it is linked.  The transfer cost from one 
type  of  node to  another is    represented in  this 
method with a link. It is a link  leaving a node 
designated  as  one  transportation  type,  and 
entering  a  node  designated  as  another.  These 
kind of links represent  transfer costs.

between  cities.    One  and  only  one  node 
represents  each  city.    Each  link  contains  the

This  type  of  model  is  smaller  by  definition 
than the multiple node method, but in this case 
the  transfer  cost  from  one  type  of  node  to 
another  must  be  represented  by  loop  on  the

understanding their structures and properties is 
just the beginning.
In  this  section,  we  want  to  show    the  most 
important  properties  of  real-world  networks. 
Of course, the knowledge of such properties is 
of fundamental importance in the development 
of accurate models.
The modeling of networks is rather simple and 
natural. It can be represented with a graph with 
nodes  and  links  connecting  nodes.  Social 
networks have been the first complex networks 
explored. One of the most famous experiments 
in  social  systems  was  performed  by  S. 
Milgram in 1960. This small world experiment 
showed that the average number of steps in an 
acquaintance  chain  length  was  only  about  six 
[34].  Analyses  on  other  networks  showed  a 
similar property,  that  it is possible to reach a 
node  from  another  one  by  going  through  a 
number of links, small if compared to the total 
number of existing nodes [35-40].
All the functions defining the performances of 
networks  modeled  with  graphs,  are  built  with  
numbers  of  nodes  and  links  and  with  the 
lengths of   the  links. For  instance, to  measure 
the  typical  separation  between  two  generic 
nodes  in  a  graph  G,  the  characteristic  path 
length L coefficient was introduced [36]:

proportional to the shortest path length. When 
the graph is  not connected, efficiency is equal 
to 0. 
A high clustering is another important property 
of  real–world  networks  [36].  To  estimate    the  
clustering of a graph G, a clustering coefficient 
C is defined as follows. For each i-node, a sub-
graph Gi of G is considered, where the nodes 
are  just the first neighbors of the i-node. The i-

node  (a  link  that  leaves  a  node  and  enters  the 
same  node).
A starting and an ending node representing the 
origin  and  destination  are  placed  on  the 
network.  The analysis of paths from origin to 
destination  allows  for  cost  calculations.    The 
shortest  path  methodology  needs  one  specific 
node  at  which  to  start  the  shortest  path 
calculations,  and  one  specific  node  at  which 
the calculated paths should end. This is what is

5.  SMALL WORLDS.

What  is  happening  now    in  the  transportation 
system  is  similar  to  what  is  observed  in  the 
development  of  the  World  Wide  Web.  Until 
recently,    all  researches  devoted  to  internet 
development  concentrated  on  improving  the  
communication protocols.  Now it is starting a 
deep investigation  on  what exactly the web is 
and  what  could  be  in  the  future  the  WWW 
under  development.    A.  Barabási  pointed  out 
that the behavior of the web is appearing much 
more  as    an  ecological  system  than    a  huge 
electronic  system  and  that,  to  understand  the 
WWW  nature  and  evolution,  it  requires  much 
more  attention  to  the  topology  of  the  network 
behind it [32,33].
The  pervasiveness  of  networks  is  evident: 
networks are the internet, the power grids, and 
the  transportation  systems,  such  as  human 
societies  and  ecosystems.  Finding  models 
which describe and predict the global behavior 
of  networks  is  then,  quite    appealing  for 
scientists.  Nevertheless, 
the 
importance    of  networks,  the  research  for

node  and  all  the  links  incident  in  it  are 
removed. If the node i has ki neighbors, Gi will 
have ki nodes and at most ki (ki-1)/2 links. Ci is 
the fraction of  links actually existing and C is 
the average of Ci, calculated over all nodes:

in 
Several  definitions  of  C  are  present 
literature  [42].    Global  and  local  scales  of  the 
system  are  therefore  analyzed  by  means  of 
these two parameters.  Let us note that a “high 
clustering”  of  a  network  means  an  high  
efficient system on a local scale.
Another important parameter is the degree of a 
node,  defined  as  the  number  of  links  incident 
with  the  node.  Consistently  the  distribution 
P(k) of degrees is defined as the probability of 
finding  nodes  with  k  links:  P(k)=N(k)/N, 
where  N(k)  is  the  number  of  nodes  with  k 
links.  Many  very  large  networks  have  the   
distribution following a power law for large k:

 
kP

~

k

(4)

where    is  an  exponent  that  often  varies 
between  2  and  3.  Networks  with  such  
distribution are  scale-free networks.
As  we  have  seen  in  the  previous  sections,  in 
real-world  networks  each  link  has  its  cost. 
Transportation  systems  are  not  interested  in 
realizing high cost networks, i.e. networks with 
a  large  number  of  links.  The  same  is  in  the 
nature  networks  minimizing  the  free  energy. 
To  estimate  the  cost  of  a  graph  G,  with  N 
nodes  and  K  links,  the  following  normalized 
number of links can be used [43]:

It  is  possible  to  define  some  simple  special 
networks,  but  these  are  rather  far  from  the 
model  of  real  networks.  One  is  the  regular 
network,  where  each  node  has  the  same 
number  of  links.  Because  of  its  excessive 
regularity, this model is a bad representation of 
reality.  Though  this  network    can  possess  a 
high clustering,  it lacks good global properties 
(LN/2k>>1).  In  the  Cayley  tree  (or  Bethe 
lattice), each node has k links as in the regular 
lattice, but no cycles exist. Such a network can 
simply  explain  the  phenomenon  of  the  “six 
degrees  of  separation”  law.  The  minimum 
number  of  steps  necessary  to  reach  a  generic 
node  from  the  root,  that  is  the  origin  of  the 
tree, is at most D=log(N)/log(k). If we assume 
in  the  world a population of  about N=109  and  
k=102,  we  find  that    4.5  average  steps  are 
enough to reach any person from the root. 

6. RANDOM NETWORKS.

Regural  or  Bethe  lattices  are  not  able  to 
describe  complex  systems.  In  1959, 
two 
Hungarian  mathematicians,  Paul  Erdôs  and 
Alfréd  Rényi,  proposed  to  randomly  build  the 
networks used to  describe communication  and 
life systems [44,45].  Their recipe was simple: 
a  random  graph  can  be  constructed  from  an 
initial  condition  with  N  nodes  and  no 
connections  by  adding  K  edges  (in  average  k 
per  node),  randomly  selecting  the  couples  of 
nodes  to  be  connected.  This  model  and  the 
related theorems proposed by Erdôs and Rényi 
revitalized  the  graph  theory,  leading  to  the 
emergence of a new research field  focusing on 
random networks [46].
In  a  random  network  the  nodes  follow  a 
Poisson  distribution  with  a  bell  shape,  with  a 
low  probability 
that  have 
significantly  more  or  fewer  links  than  the 
average  node  (see  Fig.4).  Random  networks 
are also called “exponential networks” because 
the  probability  that  a  node  is  connected  to  k 
other  nodes  decreases  exponentially  for  large 
k.

FIG.5: A free-scale network with a power law

If low cost is assumed, the Erdös-Rényi model 
presents  a  small  characteristic  path  length 
(L=log(N)/log(k)), but  low clustering (C=k/N) 
with a Poissonian degree distribution. 
A  random  network  could  model  a  highway 
network,  in  which    nodes  are  the  cities,  and  
links  are the major highways connecting them. 
Indeed,  most  cities  are  served  by  roughly  the 
same  number  of  highways.  In  contrast,  if  we 
consider  the  air  traffic  system,  we  see  that 
most nodes have only  few links (Fig.5, in the 
Appendix,  an  example  from  history).  The 
network  is  held  together by  a    low  number of 
highly  connected  hubs.  A  large  number  of 
small  airports  are  connected  to  each  other  via 
these major hubs. In this case, it is a power law 
degree  distribution  which  describes  a  scale-
free network predicting where most nodes have 
only  a  few  links.  This  was  discovered  by  A. 
Barabási  and  his  colleagues  at  the  University 
of  Notre Dame in  Indiana, when in  1999 they 
mapped the connections of the Web. The Web 
did  not  have  an  even  distribution  of 
connectivity,  that  is,  a  random  connectivity, 
but  rather  a  scale-free  distribution.  Barabási 
and  his  collaborators  called 
the  highly 
connected  nodes  "hubs"  and  coined  the  term 
"scale-free  network"  to  describe  the  class  of 
networks  that  exhibit  a  power-law  degree 
distribution  which  they  presumed  to  describe 
all real-world networks of interest.

It was shown later that most of the real-world 
networks  can  be  classified  into  two  large 
categories  according  to  the  decay  of  P(k)  for 
large k [47].
Improvements on the Erdös-Rényi model were 
proposed by Watts and Strogatz [36] and by by 
Molloy  and  Reed  [48].  The  model  of  Watts 
and  Strogatz  is  interpolating  between  regular 
and  random  graphs,  with  few  long  range 
connections leading to  good global properties, 
without  altering  the  high clustering, typical  of 
regular  networks.      The  model  proposed  by 
Molloy  and  Reed    realizes  a  random  graphs 
with  a  generic  degree  distribution  with    small  
path  length  and  low  clustering.  Though  the  
model    is  able  to  generate  networks  with  a 
scale-free  degree  distribution,  it  does  not

with an exponent  = 3, independent of m and 
of  the  size    of  the  network.  The  BA  network 
has  connectivity  properties  ensuring  a  good 
efficiency  in  communication  between  nodes. 
The  drawback  of  the  model  is  its  high 
vulnerability  to  attacks,  because  it  is  enough  
to remove few “hubs” and the efficiency of the 
network  is  destroyed  [49].  Moreover,  the 
exponent    is  fixed  and  cannot  be  tuned  to 
simulate different real networks.
An  improvement of BA model was developed 
by  Klemm  and  Eguìluz  [50,51],  which  gives  
low cost scale-free networks, both globally and 
locally  efficient.    The  model  is  based  on  the 
fact that nodes can age and that their state can

If  we  consider 
intermodal 
transport,  the  network  model  must  be  able  to 
describe the random  network properties of the 
road mode and the free-scale properties of the 
air  mode.  To  the  authors’  knowledge,  such  a 
complex  network  model  has  not  jet  been 
developed,  but 
  models  that  seem  more 
promising  to  be  modified    for  describing  the 
intermodalism are those belonging to the group 
of inhomogeneous networks. 
The  model  of  an  inhomogeneous  network  is 
usually  consisting  of  two  types  of  nodes 
denoted  by A  and  B.  Type  A  nodes  can  be 
linked  and  link  to  other  nodes,  while  type  B
nodes  can  only  link  to  others  but  not  allowed 
to  be  linked.  That  means  links between  two 
type  B  nodes  are  prohibited.  At  each  step  in  
generating the network,  a new node (A or B) 
is  created  with  probability  p  or  1-p 
ik  of the i-node
respectively. The connectivity 
is defined as the total number of links pointing 
to  it.  The presence  of  nodes  with a  very large 
number of connections is the key characteristic 
of these networks.
The probability  P(k)  that  a  node  has  k 
incoming  links  is  following  a  power  law

than  that  of  BA  model.  In  an  inhomogeneous 
network, when probability p increases from 0.1 
to  1,  the  centralization  index  changes  from 
about 0.1 to the value of the BA model.

APPENDIX

In 
the  history,  an  example  of  complex 
transportation  network  was  the  system  of 
Roman  roads.  The  network  has  Rome  at  a 
center from which  roads are  fanning  out  from 
it.  With the growing of the empire, other cities 
become hubs of the system.
In  fact,  this  network  has  a  structure  more 
similar  to  a  modern air  transport system, with 
few  hubs and links of  rather  different  lengths. 
Essential  for  the  growth  of  the  empire,  by 
enabling  it  to  move  armies,  this  network  was 
fundamental  in  maintaining    both  the  stability 
and expansion of the empire.
Was  the  roman  road  system  a  free-scale 
network? It is not simply to answer. A possible 
starting point  for approaching such a problem 
is  to  understand  how  the  Romans  displayed 
their road system.  The Romans, as the ancient 
travelers  in  general,  have  no  maps.  However, 
to have an idea about runs and distances, they 
used  "itineraria".  In  origin,    itineraria  were 
simply   lists  of  cities  along  the  roads.  To  sort 
out  the  lists,  the  Romans  drew    parallel  lines 
showing the branches of the roads. On the lines 
they  placed  symbols  for  cities,  way  stations, 
water  courses,  and  so  on.  Because 
the 
itinerarium  does  not  represent  landform,  it  is 
not a map, it is a graph. A beautiful example of 
an  ancient  graph  is  the  Tabula  Peutingeriana, 
one of  the master itineraries showing the  road 
network  which  covers  Europe,  parts  of  Asia 
and North-Africa.

destroy  the  nodes  which  have  the  most  links. 
These nodes  turn out to be removed with their 
links  from  the network.  The  measure  of  the 
possible  damage  provoked  in  the  network can 
then  be  obtained  by  evaluating  the  local  
clustering  (Eq.3)  of  the  network  and the

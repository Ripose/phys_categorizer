Abstract. We present a relativistic space-time diagram that displays in true magnitudes 
the readings  (daytimes) of two inertial reference frames clocks. One reference frame is 
the  rest  frame  for  one  clock.  This  diagram  shows  that  two  events  simultaneous  in  one 
reference frames are not compulsory simultaneous in the other frame. This approach has 
a bi-dimensional character. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
While teaching special relativity the physics professor is in the same 
 
position  as  a  parent  who  helps  his  little  child  solving  a  math  problem. 
Knowing  algebra  the  parent  could  solve  the  problem  in  two  lines,  but  he 
may have serious problems explaining it in simple but insightful terms that 
are comprehensible for the child. Without knowing or applying the algebra 
the math professor should invent intuitive solutions for each problem despite 
the fact that algebra would otherwise work comfortably in these cases.  
 
In physics the Lorentz-Einstein transformations (LET) are the algebra 
of  special  relativity.  Using  them  correctly  we  can  solve  all  the  problems 
encountered in relativistic kinematics and avoid paradoxes at same time. It is 
considered  that1:  “The  LET  is  the  standard  way  to  derive  formulas  for 
relativistic  phenomena.  Although  the  derivation  of  these  formulas  is 
straightforward, it is rather formal and not very transparent from the point of 
view of physics.” 
 
Presenting them as:

Those who use the LET should be aware of the physics behind them.

•  Events  E  and  E′  take place at the same point in space, whose position is 
defined  in  K  by  the  space  coordinates  (x,y)  respectively  in    K’  by  the 
space coordinates (x’,y’). 

•  The  clocks  of  the  two  reference  frames  are  synchronized  following  a 
procedure proposed by Einstein. The symbol c in the LET represents the 
speed  of  the  light  signal  propagating  in  vacuum  and  performing  the 
synchronization of the distant clocks. The time coordinates t and t’ (date 
  shortly 
times)  represent  the  readings  of  clocks 
located in front of each other at the point where the events take place. 
•  When the clocks of the two reference frames read a zero time (t=t’=0) 
the origins O and O’ of the two frames are located at the same point in 
space.

•  Homogeneity and isotropy of space makes that each point in space is a 
convenient host for the origins O and O’ and that each orientation of the 
axes of the two reference frames is as good as all the others.  

•  Homogeneity of time makes that there is no preferred origin for time. 

 

Omission  of  anyone  of  the  conditions  imposed  above  could  lead  to 
paradoxes and to fierce debates in order to eliminate or avoid them. This is 
the  reason  why  we  consider  that  the  investigation  of  the  difficulties 
encountered  by  students  while  learning  the  special  relativity  should  start 
with  finding  out  if  these  students  are  aware  of  the  conditions  imposed 
above2,3. 
 
 
2 Generating simultaneous events 
When  we  speak  about  a  physical  quantity  it  is  advisable  to  mention 
 
the observer(s) or the device(s) that detect or measure it, when and where the 
detection  takes  place  and  the  measuring  devices  involved.  In  our  paper we 
concentrate  on  the  concept  of  simultaneity  and  on  its  relative  character.  A 
thought  experiment  introduced  by  Einstein4  and  an  alternative  of  it5, 
subsequently borrowed by countless text books and journal papers, gave rise 
to discussions concerning the foundational and pedagogical aspects of these 
experiments6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Analysing the different approaches to the problem of 
teaching  the  relative  character of  simultaneity  we  conclude  that  they  either 
involve  the  somehow  non-intuitive  fundamental  relativistic  effects  (time 

 

2

dilation  and  length  contraction)  or  they  perform  the  LET  of  the  events 
involved in the experiment (from the reference frame where the experiment 
takes  place  toward  the  reference  frame  relative  to  which  the  experimental 
device moves). In our approach we start with some very clear definitions for 
the simultaneity of two distant events in an inertial reference frame: 
•  Two distant events are simultaneous in a given inertial reference frame if 
the clocks located at the points where the events take place display the 
same time. 

•  Two distant events are simultaneous in a given inertial reference frame if 
the light signals originating from the points where the events take place 
arrive simultaneously at the middle point in-between these origin points. 
•  Two distant clocks display the same running time after synchronization. 
All  Einstein  synchronized  clocks  within  an  inertial  reference  frame 
display the same running time. 

•  If  a  point-like  light  source  located  at  the  origin  of  an  inertial  reference 
frame  starts  emitting  light  at  t=0  in  vacuum  then  all  the  events  it 
generates after the propagation time = t further occurring on a sphere of 
radius 

 are simultaneous.

The  LET  take  a  particular  form  if  we  use  them  for  transforming  the

4. Conclusions 
 
 “Nature  has  unfortunately  denied  me  the  gift  of  being  able  to 
 
communicate,  so  that  what  I  write  is  correct,  but  also  thoroughly 
says  Albert  Einstein  about  himself13.  However  his 
indigestible” 
transformation equations succeeded to become a universal tool that reduces 
communication to zero and avoids paradoxes at same time. 
 
The relativistic diagram that we propose here illustrates quantitatively 
the  way  in  which  the  transformation  equations  differently  change  the  time 
coordinates of simultaneous events in a given inertial reference frame.

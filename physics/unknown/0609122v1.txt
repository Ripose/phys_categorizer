Abstract

We give the correct interpretation of the new metric, found lately by the author.

This metric results as an exact solution of the Einstein field equations, without the

cosmological constant. The new feature is the introduction, from the beginning, of

two rotations attributed to the Universe. As a result also an expanding, and indeed in

accelerating rate, Universe is obtained. Thus “dark energy” is not necessary at all.  We

explore some properties of this Universe in the present paper. In particular, all old

properties  of  the  Universe  concerning the  Hubble  law  remain  in  a modified   way,

implying anisotropy. Besides, we explore the validity of the Ryle-Clarke effect, which

is verified, and we find the correct age of the Universe. Finally, the resulting shape of

the Universe is examined, and it is found to be hypertoroidal.

Introduction

In our previous paper [1] we considered our three-dimensional space embedded in

a fictitious four-dimensional space, which we allowed to perform two independent

rotations, each on a coordinate plane, these two planes having in common only the

origin. Then we wrote down the appropriate for this case form of the metric in the

four-dimensional space-time. After a lot of intermediate calculations, we wrote down

the resulting Einstein field equations, which we solved analytically after a lot of effort

too.

(1.4) that the expansion is accelerated.

The coordinate system in which the above solution of Einstein´s field equations is

described is not “inertial”. We can though take from it an “inertial” coordinate system

This metric resembles the flat Friedmann model (space flat – spacetime curved), but

of course this is not that model (look at eq. 1.4). Note that the “inertial” coordinate

system   is  synchronous,   and   thus   the   proper   time  τ  =   t.   This   is   not   true   for   the

comoving coordinate system, as we will see in section 2.

In the comoving coordinate system we have for a material point of course

Thus from the metric (1.6) we get that in the “inertial” coordinate system the material

point performs two rotations, with angular velocities

   ,                                                                                   (1.8)

the first being a differential rotation and the second being a rigid rotation, or, as we

may say , the particle (or the  Universe,  since it consists of all particles) is  doubly

rotating.

In ref. [1], we have found also that, for the energy density, ε = constant· G. That is

we had obtained a steady state for the Universe. Then, we had commented as follows:

since 1) from the Ryle-Clarke effect a steady state has been excluded (for  ε  „

  0 of

course), and 2) from the time-symmetric theory of the author (for a brief account of it

see e-Appendix B in ref. [1]) we have to have ε = 0, we were obliged to take G = 0,

with the result to obtain in addition a constant gravitational field, that is no expansion

at   all,   and   besides,   because   of   the   form   of   the   metric   (1.6),   merely   a   flat

(Minkowskian) space-time (we had attributed the galactic recession, and especially in

accelerating rate, to other reasons, as it can be seen in ref. [1] after p. 55).

In ref. [1] the coordinate r was named z. And since it was a comoving coordinate,

a material particle had to move accelerating, in the “inertial” coordinate system, on a z

= constant plane. Its velocity was proportional to its distance (there) r from the z-axis,

and it had to go to a maximum distance r = z, where its velocity became equal to c. It

could of course start from r = 0, that is from the z-axis. And since it was valid for all

z, the big-bang had to be the whole z-axis. But the big-bang is very well established

up to now to be a point rather than an axis. Thus we have to abandon that picture, and

accept G „

 0, in order to recover the expansion (from a point of course, the origin).

But then besides the desired expansion (and indeed accelerating), we have to now

accept  ε  = constant  „

  0, that is  a steady state. We  will see that the author´s time

symmetric theory mentioned before eventually is not violated in section 6. Concerning

the Ryle-Clarke effect we will try to explore its validity, and we surprisingly see that,

because of the new geometry, it is also fulfilled , after a derivation in section 3.

In sections 4 & 5 we will see that Hubble´s law continues to hold, if we neglect

the angular velocities ω1 & ω2. And, in section 6, we will see that if we take them into

account, an anisotropy in the Hubble flow results, even to the first order both in ω1

2 &

ω2

2, and in the distance from the source, holding thus for small distances and small ω1

2

& ω2

2, too.

And a few words on the interpretation of the new metric, in particular in the form

(1.6). At first, we see that it describes a rigid rotation about the origin on the (r, Φ)

plane with angular velocity ω2. Then the whole (r, Φ) plane rotates differentially with

angular velocity ω1 about an axis, say Z, perpendicular to the plane of φ´s, which axis

we can take as the common original axis for measuring Φ´s on the (r,Φ) planes (Fig.1)

5

Alternatively, we can rename (because of the absence of coefficient in dφ2) φ to z,

so that it is recognized that the metric inside the curly brackets in (1.6) is just the line

element, say dσ2, of flat space in cylindrical coordinates, and we may write
d

2.                                                                                         (1.9)

We have to mention however that z (”

 φ) cannot take all real vales, since it represents

actually an angle (φ), and thus it can take only the values from 0 to 2π, where it must

be meant that the value 2π  is identified with the value 0. In this  picture we may

imagine the planes (r, Φ) as being parallel to one another , and perpendicular to the z

axis from z = 0 to z = 2π, where the plane for z = 2π is identified with the plane z = 0

(see Fig. 2). Obviously, a particle moves on a solid helix with axis the z-axis, in this

2nd picture.

For   more   on   the   correct   interpretation   of   the   coordinates,   and   the   resulting

geometrical shape of the Universe see Appendix B.

Obviously the quantity under the square root sign has to be positive, in order for

the coordinate system to be realizable by real bodies. Thus, for a certain time t, there

is a maximum allowed value of r. At greater r the bodies realizing the coordinate

system have to move simply with velocities greater than c, which is absurd. For a

fixed r on the other hand, there is a minimum allowed value of t, namely it must

for which we take from (2.5) that τ = 0. It has no meaning to consider τ < 0, because

then the body at r must move again with a velocity greater than c.

The Ryle-Clarke effect

For simplicity, we assume that ω1 @

 ω2 ,which can be achieved by taking ξ @

 η. This is justified from the fact that, if ω1 and ω2  had appreciable values, then we

would have discovered the (double) rotation of the Universe earlier. Thus we will take

which is the same with the “inertial” metric (1.6). Now since the spatial metric (the

metric inside the curly brackets) is flat, we can assume that we have taken the origin at

the observer.

“distance” R apart with frequency ν, and received by the observer at the frequency ν0,

where J is the intensity function, and z the redshift, with one crucial difference: we do

not write the Euclidean value 4πU0

source and of radius our “distance” R, but rather the correct for our case value (2π)

Thus we found F0 as a function of R, too, say F0 = g(R).

Thus, we have found the number of radio-galaxies m inside a sphere of “radius”

R, i.e. brighter than those with flux density F0, as a function of F0, which function is

given parametrically, with parameter the “distance” R, by (3.12) & (3.23), which is of

This relation has to fit the data of the  empirical relation logm = F(logF0), that is to

conform with the Ryle-Clarke effect [6, 2].

With some suitable choices of the constants C1  & C2  , we plotted the function

(3.28), with the help of “Mathematica”, which we expose in Fig. 3. The observational

                                Fig.3                                                  Fig. 4 (from [6])     

curve, due to Ryle, is shown in Fig. 4 [7]. We cannot help admiring the excellent

agreement   of   the   two   curves!   Note   that   the   actual   curve   of   radio   counts   ”is   not

consistent with static Euclidean space, the steady-state model, or simple Friedmann

models” [6].

We remark that by appropriately fitting exactly the theoretical curve to the data by

choosing the best values of C1 & C2 , we can find first U0 from C1. Then we can find G

from C2 as well. Also, as we will see in section 7, knowing H0 (observable) we can

determine the particle horizon, given by U0σ0 , by the relation

Then, having found U0  above, we can also determine  σ0, the “coordinate” particle

horizon.

Hubble´s law

We work in the same approximation as in the preceding section.

The Hubble parameter is defined by
= &

Substituting U(t) from (1.4), we obtain
H G=

,                                                                                                                       (4.2)

at all times.

The element of spatial distance dl is given by
=

dl U t ds
( )

.                                                                                                             (4.3)

The “instantaneous” finite distance at time t, will then be
l U t

U t

( ) .                                                                                               (4.4)

For two galaxies separated by this distance, the rate of change of their distance, that is

their relative “velocity” of recession, will be given by

=

so that

This is  Hubble´s law. Note that this velocity is not a local concept, and so  it is not

limited to be less than c. It can be even superluminal!

But what we are actually observing is not the velocity v, but rather the redshift z of

a galaxy. We can find the Hubble law in terms of z as follows.

We have

where  λ0  is the wavelength of light coming from some (cosmological) source at the

observer, and  λ  the wavelength of the same light at the source. But, because of the

smallness of this wavelength, as compared with cosmological distances, we may set λ0

= dl0 & λ = dl. Then we have

Writing U = U(t0  – (t0  –t)), with   t0  – t   being small, we have approximately, if we

We have met three kinds of distance: the instantaneous distance l = Uσ , the light

distance d = cΔt, and the luminosity distance D = (cid:214) (S/4π) (*). But, since we work to the

lowest order, it is evident that l @

 d @

 D. Also, in the same approximation, we observe

that cz @

 v, resembling the Doppler shift. Of course it is not a Doppler shift, since the

matter is comoving in our coordinate system.

Using the luminosity distance D, we can write for Hubble´s law

(*)  The luminosity distance D is defined by the requirement that the flux density F0  of a source with

luminosity L is given by the relation F0 = L/(4πD).

The deceleration parameter and the distance-redshift relation

As we have seen, the Hubble parameter is given by

&

0                                                                                                      (5.1)

The deceleration parameter is defined by

Thus substituting U, U(cid:215) , and U(cid:215)

(cid:215)  in (5.2), we find for the deceleration parameter

1.                                                                                                       (5.5)

This corresponds to the steady-state model, and it means that the Universe is actually

accelerating its expansion.

The distance-redshift relation is now derived in a completely similar fashion with

the Friedmann models [2]. It gives the redshift z versus the luminosity distance D,

with parameters H & q, and it is given by

This relation has to be satisfied approximately for q = -1, and H = G (we emphasize

Anisotropic Universe

A very important issue concerning our model Universe is the issue of isotropy.

Obviously   it   is  not  isotropic,   not   even   homogeneous   (the   space-time).   It   can

magnificently be manifested by the anisotropy of the Hubble flow, as we will see in

this section. And perhaps it is the proper time for an introduction of an anisotropy in

our real Universe, since lately there is plenty evidence of an anisotropy at large scales

in   the   distribution   of   redshifts   on   the   sky,   and   moreover   of   the   temperature,   the

polarization,   and   the   morphology  of   the   3K   microwave   radiation   on   the   celestial

sphere (see arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/…). Of course this anisotropy is much smaller in

magnitude,   by  about   a   factor   of   10-3,   than   the   one   induced  by  the   motion   of  the

observer.   It  is   however   measurable,   if   we   subtract   the   anisotropy  resulted   by  our

motion. We will see in the following theoretical treatment that the anisotropy we are

speaking of shows up even in the first approximation,  and is a result  of the non-

vanishing of ω1 & ω2.

where G stands for the Hubble constant, and τ is the travel time of light. We assume

of course that the light comes tangent to the   r-curve passing through the observer,

with the result to take dφ1 = dφ2. Use is also made of formulae (A24) in the Appendix

A. We see thus that in the case on hand we have

We   have   to   remark   that   perhaps   the   above   anisotropy   caused   the   fact   of

disagreement among almost all determinations of the Hubble constant even up to our

days, with the result for the astronomer to have no absolutely reliable value of that

constant at his disposal up to now.

A new time coordinate, the Hubble law, and the age of cosmos

If in the metric (1.6) we set for the scale factor 

GtEe

=

cT s

0 ,                                                                                                        (7.1)

where  σ0  is   the   coordinate   particle   horizon   today,   we   can   introduce   a   new   time

coordinate T in the metric. From (7.1) we find

,                                                                                                               (7.2)

An interresting feature of the new metric is the following. From (7.4) we get

,                                                                                                             (7.5)

   (7.8)

Thus, for T > 0 we take our familiar Universe, which we call cosmos, while for T < 0

we take the anti-cosmos (cf. e-Appendix B in [1]). In other words, the Universe for T

< 0 is the right place for anti-cosmos!

Concerning the  age  of cosmos, it is easy to see that it is infinite in terms of the

coordinate t, or even of the proper time τ. However it is interesting to see that it is not

the case for the new coordinate T (this was the underlying motivation for introducing

I f we denote by G the Hubble constant in the t-time from now on, and by H the

(cf. with (7.18)). Note that from

we get differentiating

Finally, we have to justify why T0 gives in fact the age of the Universe. This can

be   easily  done   by  noting   that   the   particle   horizon,   which   is   given   by  the   proper

distance U0σ0 , has to be set equal to the actual age of the Universe times the velocity

of light c. We have in fact then

And thus we correctly take this age from formulae (7.10), and/or (7.11), as given by
T
0

.                                                                                                                (7.29)

H=

0

Note that H0 is observable. Thus we can find T0 from H0 .

Note concerning non-cosmological implications

It has to be noted that of course non-cosmological implications  of the present

model Universe exist as well. We can distinguish among them the implications on the

structure and dynamical evolution of galaxies. We mention in particular two of them.

First,   the   explanation   of   the   galactic   flat   rotation   curves,   attributed   to   the

differential rotation of the Universe. See physics/0602035.

Second,   the   explanation   of   the   spiral   structure   in   spiral   galaxies,   attributed   to

Coriolis forces, coming from the rigid rotation of the Universe. See physics/0607214.

In these two applications we have assumed the constant metric (G = 0), but the

analysis remains valid approximately even when we assume the general metric(G „

 0)

of the present paper. It is sufficient to assume in addition that the field changes slowly,

or that the analysis applies for a short period of time.

Appendix B: The shape and the equations of the Universe

1. One may ask: how can we identify the (r, Φ) planes for z = 0 & z = 2π (see fig.

2), since all (r, Φ) planes remain parallel to one another. The answer is that we can do

it   if   we   imagine   our   three-dimensional   space   embedded   in   a   fictitious   four-

dimensional (Euclidean) space. (Thus we return to the picture from where we started

in the beginning). To make things clear, suppose that we suppress the Z coordinate on

these planes, and we retain only one dimension, say x (x  ^

  Z), from each of these

planes. Then our three-dimensional space will become a two-dimensional space, (x,

z),  which we can imagine embedded in  a three-dimensional  Euclidean  space (not

necessarily in the former one). As long as we move on the two dimensional space (x,

z), we may consider it flat (its metric is indeed flat). If however take in mind the third

dimension   of   the   Euclidean   space   mentioned,   we   can   see   that   in   reality  the   line

segment [0, 2π) must be curved in the circumference of a circle, with center outside

the space (x, z) and unit radius, perpendicular to all x´s axes (being parallel to one

another) in a way which permits us to identify 0 with 2π. The two-dimensional space

will thus be in reality the surface of an infinite circular cylinder. Its metric permits it,

since there is no difference in the line element on a plane and on a cylinder. Now

suppose that instead of the straight lines x we have the planes (r,  Φ)  ”

  (x,  Ζ), and

instead of the two-dimensional space (x,z) we have our three-dimensional space. Then

we will need a fictitious Euclidean four-dimensional space instead of the above three-

dimensional Euclidean space, in order to perform the same process.

It   is   now   evident   that   the   origin   O,   which   has   been   taken   as   the   center   of

differential rotation on the  φ´s plane (see fig. 1) must be taken  outside  our three-

dimensional  space (C). In this respect the earlier picture of the center of differential

rotation   belonging   in   our   three-dimensional   space   is   naïve.   It   is   simply   as   if   we

attributed a rotational motion of the x-axes around O on the surface (x, z), which we

imagine as a plane and not as a cylindrical surface. Only the Φ-rotation on an (r, Φ)

plane has its center, say O, in our three-dimensional space (see fig. 1). Indeed, in this

case the  Φ-rotations of all (r,  Φ) planes will take place around those centers, which

form the Oz axis (see fig. 2) from 0 to 2π. Of course the line segment [0, 2π) will be

the circumference of a circle of unit radius, as explained above.

Thus, from the above considerations we see that: 1) the surfaces of constant φ are

the (r, Φ) planes, 2) the surfaces of constant Φ are truncated conical, because of the φ

rotation, with a common axis Cx, passing the latter through the center C of Universal

rotation (lying outside our Universe) (see fig.5), and parallel to the direction Ox, & 3)

the surfaces of constant r will be tori  with the common center of the torus´ great circle

identified with the center of Universal (φ-)rotation (C), and the centers of the small

circles along the line segment [0, 2π) curved to the circumference O (see fig. 6). As a

conclusion   we   may   say   with   confidence   that  the   shape   of   our   Universe   is

hypertoroidal.

27

This   is   the   case   mainly   because   the   orbit   of   a   particle   of   the   cosmic   fluid,

considered earlier as a solid helix, is a helix on the surface of a torus. Thus, a particle

of the cosmic fluid will remain on the surface of one and the same member of a family

of tori, because right r is a commoving coordinate and does not change for the particle

on hand. And on this toroidal surface it will perform the two rotational motions: one

around the O curve (circle) (see fig. 6) with angular velocity ω2 = dΦ/dt, and the other

around the center C of Universal rotation (lying outside our three-dimensional space)

with angular velocity ω1 = dφ/dt.

We can take the torus mentioned above from topological considerations, too. We

know that a torus can be taken from a square by identifying its opposite sides, one pair

after the other. After the first identification we will take a cylindrical surface limited

by two end-circles, which are the   other pair of sides of the square curved until they

close to circles. Thus, the second identification concerns these two limiting circles,

and it leads right to the torus.

Now, in our case the cylindrical surface already exists. It is the cylindrical surface

with axis Oz and radius r, limited by its circles at z = 0 and z = 2π (see fig. 2). It is

then simple to identify these circles and take topologically the torus.

Then, of course the various cylinders for different r´s, as being “one inside the

other”, will result in a family of tori “one inside the other”, our Universe.

So far we have examined the purely spatial part dσ2  of the metric. If we take in

mind also the scale factor U(t), we will see that our 3-dimensional space will expand

accelerating, with the angular velocities  ω1  &  ω2  relaxing. As we go back in time

following the shrinking of the Universe, we will approach at the limit the center C,

where the big-bang took place.

28

The total volume of the hypertorus (of our Universe) will be obviously infinite

concerning   the   metric   dσ2,   since   it   contains   points   lying  at   infinity  (r   =  ¥

).   But

concerning the spatial metric dl2  = U2(t)dσ2  at some instance t0  the volume of the

Universe will be finite. In fact, we have to take (for negligible ω1 & ω2)

2. Another approach, more formal, to find the shape of the Universe is to find directly

the equations which describe it, as follows. If we imagine our Universe embedded in

the fictitious Euclidean four-dimensional space (x1, x2, x3, x4) from which we started

our investigation at the first place (see [1], pp. 11-12), the equation (35) of [1], which

gives the line element of this four-space, if we take in mind the equations of p. 52 of

[1], becomes (remember that we have renamed z to r)

in complete agreement with (1.6), which gives (1.9). Thus our results are first verified.

Next, if we take in mind eq. (305) of [1], namely

We see at once that, for the comoving coordinate r fixed (thus for two parameters:

φ  &  Φ), eqns. (B7) describe a torus in four (4) dimensions, since they describe the

Cartesian product of two circles.

we have the equations of the orbit of a particle of the cosmic fluid in parametric form.

The section by the plane (x3, x4) gives an harmonic motion. The same applies to the

(x1, x2) section, giving another harmonic motion. Finally the (x1, x3), (x1, x4), (x2, x3),

(x2, x4) sections give simply Lissajous pictures. Of course, in the case of the orbits the

scale factor U(t) has to be also taken into account.

The area of this torus is obviously (see (B5), where we disregard U(t), set dr = 0,

and we apply the Pythagorean theorem)

Now, allow r to come into play. We then will have a family of tori, parametrized

by r, which have common great circle of radius 1 (unity) and “cross-section” a circle

of radius r, in a way being “one inside another”. In this sense we may, thus, say that

our Universe is a “hypertorus” with the meaning described above as a family of tori.

If finally we take also in mind the scale factor U(t), the resulting situation is easy

to be understood, and has been described  in 1. above.

Conclusion

As a conclusion, we may say about the shape of the Universe that, for a given

instant of time t0 , it is a hypertorus, that is a family of toroidal surfaces, “built” upon

the circumference of a circle with radius U(t0). All this has to be meant as accelerating

expanding with time t, in such a way that the family remains similar to itself. We have

even   found   the   equations   giving   the   shape   of   the   hypersurface   representing   the

Universe, which are right eqns. (B7).

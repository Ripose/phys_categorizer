Abstract

We propose two ways for determining the Green’s matrix for problems ad-
mitting Hamiltonians that have inﬁnite symmetric tridiagonal (i.e. Jacobi)
matrix form on some basis representation. In addition to the recurrence re-
lation comming from the Jacobi-matrix, the ﬁrst approach also requires the
matrix elements of the Green’s operator between the ﬁrst elements of the
basis.
In the second approach the recurrence relation is solved directly by
continued fractions and the solution is continued analytically to the whole
complex plane. Both approaches are illustrated with the non-trivial but cal-
culable example of the D-dimensional Coulomb Green’s matrix. We give the
corresponding formulas for the D-dimensional harmonic oscillator as well.

I. INTRODUCTION

Green’s operators play a central role in theoretical physics, especially in quantum me-
chanics, since the fundamental equations are formulated as integral equations containing
Green’s operators in their kernels.
Integral equation formalisms have an advantage over
those based on diﬀerential equations because they automatically incorporate the boundary
conditions. In spite of this fact diﬀerential equations are more extensively used in practi-
cal calculations. The reason certainly is that the Green’s operators occurring in integral
equations are much more complicated than the corresponding terms in the Hamiltonian.

A possible way of compensating this drawback is using a representation in which the
Green’s operator appears in a simple form. In this respect the momentum-space representa-
tion is rather appealing, as the free Green’s operator is very simple there. This is the main
reason why momentum-space techniques are so frequently used and also why they are ca-
pable of coping with complicated integral equations like the Faddeev equations (see Ref. [1]
for a review).

The free Green’s operator can also be given analytically between harmonic oscillator
(HO) states [2]. This allowed the construction of a ﬂexible method for solving the Lippmann–
Schwinger equation in HO-space, which contains the free Green’s operator in its kernel [3].
The representation of operators on a ﬁnite subset of a countable basis, such as the HO
basis, turns the Lippmann–Schwinger equation into a matrix equation. The completeness of
the basis ensures the convergence of the method. Actually, this is equivalent to a separable
expansion of the potential (see e.g. Ref. [4] for a review). In this approach only the potential
term is approximated, the terms in the Green’s operator (the kinetic energy term in the case
of the free Green’s operator) are not. Thus, although one is working with ﬁnite matrices,
the solution possesses correct asymptotic behavior.

To give account of the fact that Coulombic asymptotics are genuinely diﬀerent from the
free one, the kernel of the integral equations describing Coulombic systems should include
Coulombic, rather than free Green’s operators. For the two-body Coulomb Green’s operator
there exists a Hilbert-space basis in which its representation is very simple, namely the
Coulomb–Sturmian (CS) basis. In CS-space the Coulomb Green’s operator can be given by
simple and well-computable special functions, which can be continued analytically to the
complex plane [5]. This is also a countable basis, so we have a matrix representation.

In the past few years a quantum mechanical approximation method for treating Coulomb-
like interactions in two-body calculations was developed along this line. The analytic
Coulomb Green’s matrix allows the extension of the method to resonant- and scattering-state
calculations [6]. Since only the asymptotically irrelevant short-range interaction is approx-
imated, the correct (two-body) Coulomb asymptotics is guaranteed. The corresponding
computer codes for solving two-body bound-, resonant- and scattering-state problems were
also published [7].

Recently the CS-space representation approach to the Faddeev integral equations has
been applied to solving the three-body bound- and scattering-state problem with Coulomb
interactions [8,9]. In this formulation of the equations the most crucial point is calculat-
ing the resolvent of the sum of two independent, thus commuting, two-body Coulombic
Hamiltonians. This is given by the convolution integral [10]

2

(z − h1 − h2)−1 =

dw (z − w − h1)−1 (w − h2)−1.

(1.1)

Here the contour C should encircle, in counterclockwise direction, the spectrum of h2 without
penetrating into the spectrum of h1 . The analytic nature of the two-body Green’s matrix
made the evaluation of the contour integral, also in practice, possible. In fact, the convolution
integral follows directly from the Dunford–Taylor integral representation of operators [11].
A function of an operator h is deﬁned as

f (h) =

dw f (w)(w − h)−1,

(1.2)

2πi IC

2πi IC

where f should be analytic on C. This way we can calculate complicated functions of
operators as well.

Making use of (1.1), we can solve problems which otherwise would amount to solving
non-separable partial diﬀerential equations with unknown boundary conditions. So we be-
lieve that the analytic representation of simple Green’s operators is of extreme importance,
probably in other ﬁelds of physics too, but certainly for the solution of the underlying integral
equations of quantum mechanics.

S(r) and

C(r). The Jacobi-matrix solutions

Hamiltonians having Jacobi-matrix forms were also extensively studied in the context of
the L2 approach to quantum scattering theory [12,13]. Here the Hamiltonian is represented
on an appropriate L2 basis, which is chosen in such a way, that the asymptotic part of the
Hamiltonian possesses a Jacobi-matrix form. The resulting three-term recurrence relation
S(r)
can be solved analytically, yielding the expansion coeﬃcients of both a ”sine-like”
C(r) are then
and the ”cosine-like” solution
used to obtain the exact solution to a model scattering problem deﬁned by approximating
the potential V by its projection V N onto the ﬁnite subspace spanned by the ﬁrst N basis
functions. So, on the level of physical assumptions the L2 approach and the methods used in
Refs. [3] and [5–7] are equivalent in the same sense as the Schr¨odinger equation is equivalent
to the Lippmann–Schwinger equation. However, we believe that the approaches starting
from integral equations, especially those in Refs. [5–7], are superior since they allow us to
cope with problems still lacking satisfactory solution, such as three-body scattering problems
with Coulomb interactions. We note that in the L2 approach the Green’s function of a
Jacobi-matrix Hamiltonian can also be constructed from the coeﬃcients of the solutions
C(r) [13]. However, this construction is applicable only in very exceptional cases.
S(r) and
In this paper we wish to demonstrate that, if the Hamiltonian appears in a symmetric
e
inﬁnite tridiagonal, i.e. Jacobi-matrix form in some basis representation with analytically
known matrix elements, then the corresponding Green’s matrix can be given in terms of
three-term recurrence relation. We present two independent methods for determining the
Green’s matrix from a three-term recurrence relation.

e

In our ﬁrst method (method A) we consider this relation only as a useful computational
tool. In addition to the recurrence relation this approach also requires,the matrix element
of the Green’s operator between the ﬁrst elements of the basis. This often necessitates the
analytical evaluation of complicated integrals, which restricts its use to exceptional cases
only. Once this matrix element has been calculated, we can resort to the recurrence relation
in order to determine the Green’s matrix. However, from the numerical point of view the
recurrence relations can lead to calculational problems and instabilities [14].

3

In our second approach (method B) we propose direct solution of this recurrence relation
by continued fractions. The richness of the theory of recurrence relations and continued
fractions enable us to avoid the diﬃcult and strenuous procedure of method A. The inverse
of the Green’s matrix can be evaluated solely from the ratio of two successive elements of
the recurrence relation. In method B this ratio is provided by a continued fraction. This
means that, all the above mentioned numerical problems can be avoided, since the recurrence
relation is completely ignored as a computational tool.

In Sec. II below we sketch methods A and B. In Sec. III we illustrate method A with a
non-trivial but calculable example, the D-dimensional Coulomb problem. The corresponding
3-dimensional formulas had been presented earlier [5–7] and were extensively used in both
two- and three-body calculations. A summary of the relevant mathematical formulas for
continued fractions and three-term recurrence relations is given in Sec. IV. In Sec. V method
B is presented using the example of the D-dimensional Coulomb problem. This is followed
by numerical illustrations in Sec. VI. Finally, in the Appendix the D-dimensional harmonic
oscillator is considered. We show, that the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian takes a Jacobi-
matrix form on a harmonic oscillator basis that has a diﬀerent frequency parameter.

II. JACOBI-MATRIX REPRESENTATION

We ﬁrst deﬁne our representation space for the quantum mechanical problem. Let us
consider the basis states {|ii} and {|˜ii}, with i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., which form a complete bi-
orthogonal set, i.e.

h˜i|ji = hi|˜ji = δij

1 =

|˜iihi| =

|iih˜i|,

1 = (E − H)G,

|˜ji = (E − H)G|˜ji.

δij =

hi|(E − H)|i′ih˜i′|G|˜ji.

∞

Xi′=0

4

Let us start with the deﬁning equation of the Green’s operator G corresponding to Hamil-
tonian H

and apply it to the ket |˜ji

Inserting a completeness relation between E − H and G, and multiplying form the left by
the bra hj| we get

If hi|(E − H)|i′i takes a Jacobi-matrix form the inﬁnite sum is reduced only to three terms
and we arrive at a recurrence relation for the matrix elements Gij = h˜i|G|˜ji:

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

δij = Jii−1Gi−1j + JiiGij + Jii+1Gi+1j,

i = 1, 2, . . . , j = 0, 1, . . . ,

(2.6)

where Jij = hi|(E − H)|ji are the elements of the Jacobi-matrix. For the i = j = 0 case Eq.
(2.5) takes the form

1 = J01G10 + J00G00.

(2.7)

In method A, if G00 is known, we can calculate G10 from (2.7), and then can continue
to Gj0 using Eq. (2.6). Interchanging the indices in Eq. (2.6) we again get a three-term
recurrence relation which can be utilized to generate the Gij elements from the known
G0j terms. The analytic calculation of G00 together with the application of the recurrence
relation (2.6) with (2.7) constitutes the basic idea of method A.

In method B we compute the Green’s matrix without the explicit use of the recurrence
relation. From the theory of special matrices we know that the inverse of a Jacobi-matrix,
i.e. the Green’s matrix, possesses the property [15]

Gij =

piqj,
pjqi,

(

if

i ≤ j
j ≤ i

.

(2.8)

Therefore, for j ≤ N and i ≤ N we can write the resolvent equation (2.5) as

δij =

(Jii′Gi′i − δiN JiN +1 GjN +1)

(Jii′ − δiN δi′N JiN +1 pN +1/pN )Gi′j

(Jii′ − δiN δi′N JiN +1 G0N +1/G0N )Gi′j,

(2.9)

i.e. the inverse of the truncated N × N G(N )

ij Green’s matrix is given as

(G(N )

ij )−1 = Jij − δjN δiN JN N +1 G0N +1/G0N .

(2.10)

Eq. (2.10) asserts that the inverse of the truncated Green’s matrix is determined by the
elements of the Jacobi-matrix and the ratio G0N +1/G0N . This later will be calculated by
continued fractions derived only from the elements of Jacobi-matrix. This is the basic idea
of method B. We notice, that in many practical applications, like the solution of Lippmann–
Schwinger equations, it is directly the (G(N )

j,i )−1 that is really needed (see e.g. Ref. [8,9]).

III. D-DIMENSIONAL COULOMB GREEN’S MATRIX IN
COULOMB–STURMIAN REPRESENTATION

Here we deﬁne the Coulomb–Sturmian basis and show that on this particular basis the
D-dimensional Coulomb Hamiltonian has a Jacobi-matrix structure. We also derive the
corresponding three-term recurrence relation for the Green’s matrix and present its solution

5

via method A. In doing so we apply techniques established already for the three-dimensional
(D = 3) case [5].

Let us consider the radial Schr¨odinger equation for the D-dimensional hydrogen atom in

IV. CONTINUED FRACTIONS AND THREE-TERM RECURRENCE
RELATIONS

Based on the mathematical literature [20,14] we give a brief review of the underlying
mathematical theorems. Let {an(z)}∞
1 and {bn(z)}∞
0 , an(z) 6= 0, be two sequences of com-
plex valued functions deﬁned on the region D of the complex plane. We deﬁne the linear
fractional transformation sn(w, z) as

sn(wn, z) =

, n ≥ 1,

s0(w0, z) = b0(z) + w0,

(4.1)

an(z)
bn(z) + wn

and

Sn(wn, z) = Sn−1(sn(wn, z), z),

S0(w0, z) = s0(w0, z).

(4.2)

A continued fraction is an ordered pair

7

(({an(z)}, {bn(z)}), {fn(z)}),

where {fn(z)} is given by

fn(z) = Sn(0, z),

n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .

Here Sn(wn, z) is called the nth approximant of the continued fraction with respect to the
{wn}∞
n=0 complex series. Sn(wn, z) can be written, using one of the standard notations, as

Sn(wn, z) = b0(z) +

a1(z)
b1(z) +

a2(z)
b2(z) + · · · +

an(z)
bn(z) + wn

.

The convergence of a continued fraction means the convergence of the sequence of approxi-
mants Sn(wn, z) to an extended complex number

where

f (z) = lim
n→∞

Sn(wn, z) = b0(z) + K∞
n=1

an(z)
bn(z) !

,

 

K∞
n=1

an(z)
bn(z) !

 

=

a1(z)
b1(z) +

a2(z)
b2(z) + · · · +

an(z)
bn(z) + · · ·

.

It should be noted that if f (z) exists for two diﬀerent sequences of {ωn} then f (z) is unique.

A special class of continued fractions for which the limits

lim
n→∞

an(z) = a(z)

and

lim
n→∞

bn(z) = b(z)

exist for all z ∈ D is called limit 1-periodic continued fractions. The ﬁxed points w±(z) of
the linear fractional transformation

where w = limn→∞ wn, are given as the solution of the quadratic equation

s(w, z) = lim
n→∞

sn(wn, z) =

a(z)
b(z) + w

,

w =

a(z)
b(z) + w

,

w±(z) = −b(z)/2 ±

(b(z)/2)2 + a(z).

The w±(z) with smaller modulus is called attractive ﬁxed point, while the other one is
called as repulsive ﬁxed point. Since w±(z) represent the tail of a limit 1-periodic continued
fraction we can speed up the convergence using the attractive ﬁxed point in the approximant
Sn(w, z).

The idea of the analytic continuation of the continued fraction f (z) in Eq. (4.6) is based
on the proper choice of {wn} in the approximant Sn(wn, z) [20,21]. If a continued fraction
exists in a certain complex region z ∈ D then in many cases it is possible to extend the

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

region of convergence to a larger domain D∗ ⊇ D, where D∗ depends on the choice of the
functions wn(z). In the case of limit 1-periodic continued fractions the analytic continuation
is deﬁned with the help of the ﬁxed points w±(z) of Eq. (4.10) as

fD∗(z) = lim
n→∞

Sn(w±(z), z).

(4.12)

The computation of the approximants Sn(w±(z), z) might be unstable for certain z,
which leads to unsatisfactory convergence. This problem can be overcome by using
the Bauer–Muir transformation [20]. The Bauer–Muir transform of a continued fraction
b0(z) + K (an(z)/bn(z)) with respect to a sequence of complex numbers {wn}∞
n=0 is the con-
tinued fraction d0(z) + K (cn(z)/dn(z)), whose “classical” approximants Sn(0, z) are equal
to the modiﬁed approximants Sn(wn, z) of the original continued fraction. The transformed
continued fraction exists and can be calculated as

d0 = b0 + w0,
ci = ai−1qi−1,
λi = ai − wi−1(bi + wi),

d1 = b1 + w1,
c1 = λ1,
di = bi + wi − wi−2qi−1,
qi = λi+1/λi

i ≥ 2,

i ≥ 1,

(4.13)

if and only if λi 6= 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . .

We now return to the three-term recurrence relation focusing on their intimate relations

to continued fractions. A three-term recurrence relation can be written as

Xn+1 = bnXn + anXn−1

n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,

(4.14)

where an, bn are complex numbers and an 6= 0. The solutions of a three-term recurrence
relation span a two-dimensional linear space. The {xn} nontrivial (i.e.6= {0}) solution is
said to be minimal if there exists another solution {yn} such that

lim
n→∞

xn/yn = 0.

(4.15)

Solution {yn} here is called dominant. The minimal solution is unique, apart from a multi-
plicative constant.

The existence of the minimal solution is strongly related to the convergence of a continued
fraction constructed from the coeﬃcients of the recurrence relation. This connection is
revealed by Pincherle’s theorem [14,20]. According to this the following statements hold:
A: (4.14) has a minimal solution if and only if the continued fraction

The second statement asserts that the ratio of two successive element of the minimal solution
is provided by a continued fraction.

V. CONTINUED FRACTION FOR G0N +1/G0N

First we show that in certain domain of the complex plane the physical relevant solution
of the recurrence relation (2.6) for the Green’s matrix is the minimal solution. In case of
short-range potentials the Green’s function can be constructed as [22]

G(r, r′, k) = ϕl(k, r<)f (+)

l

(k, r>)/F (k),

where ϕl(k, r) is the regular solution, f (+)
and k is the wave number. The Jost solution is deﬁned by the relation

l

(k, r) is the Jost solution, F (k) is the Jost function

lim
r→∞

e∓ikr f (±)

l

(k, r) = 1.

Let us deﬁne a “new” Green’s function as

G(r, r′, k) = ϕl(k, r<)fl(k, r>)/F (k),

where fl is a linear combination of f (+)
decreasing and f (−)

l

is exponentially increasing. Thus, for any

if ℜE < 0.

e

We note, that both G and
G satisfy the deﬁning equation Eq. (2.3), but only G of Eq. (5.1)
is the physical Green’s function. The above considerations, with a slight modiﬁcation in Eq.
(5.2), are also valid for the Coulomb case.

e

e

An interesting result of the study of Ref. [13] is that the Green’s matrix from Jacobi-
matrix Hamiltonian, in correspondence with (2.8), has an analogous structure to Eq. (5.1)

Gii′(k) = (ϕl)i<(k)(f (+)

l

)i>(k)/F (k),

where (ϕl)i(k) = hϕl(k)|

On the ℜE < 0 region of the complex plane as r → ∞ fl(k, r) exponentially dominates over

(k, r), thus for their L2 representation the following relation holds

So, in the ℜE < 0 region of complex E-plane the physical relevant Green’s matrix Gii′
appears as the minimal solution of recurrence relation (2.6). Thus, according to Pincherle’s
theorem (4.17), the ratio needed in Eq. (2.10) for the Green’s matrix can be calculated by
the continued fraction

where ai = −Jii−1/Jii+1, bi = −Jii/Jii+1 and Jij is the Jacobi-matrix.
In the case of D-dimensional Coulomb Green’s matrix we have

with ǫ = 2mE/¯h2, Z ′ = 2mZ/¯h2 and l

= l + (D − 3)/2.
On the region of scattering states the recurrence relation does not have minimal solution
and the continued fraction (5.9) diverges. On the other hand, G0N +1(ǫ)/G0N (ǫ) is an analytic
function of ǫ, and there is a region of the complex plane where we have a representation for
this function, thus values on other regions can be obtained by the analytic continuation of
the bound-state formula, i.e. by the analytic continuation of the continued fraction (5.9).
Since now we have a limit 1-periodic continued fraction this, according to Eq. (4.12), can
be achieved with ﬁxed points

where

where ψ(E) is the scattering wave function, and the analytic properties of Green’s operators
ii should be negative. This
we can readily derive that the imaginary part of h
condition can only be fulﬁlled with the choice of w+. This choice gives an analytic contin-
uation to the physical sheet, while w−, which also converges, gives an analytic continuation
to the unphysical sheet.

¿From the above considerations it follows that utilizing the Jacobi-matrix only the
Green’s matrix can be obtained for arbitrary complex energies by simply evaluating a con-
tinued fraction.

VI. NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATIONS

Below we demonstrate the convergence and the numerical accuracy of method B. We
calculate the matrix element GC
00(ǫ) of D-dimensional Coulomb Green’s operator for the
l = 0 and D = 3 case at bound- and scattering-state energies. We examine the convergence
of continued fraction with diﬀerent choice of {wn} in Eq. (4.6) and the eﬀect of Bauer-Muir
transformation. For comparison we also give the exact value for GC

00(ǫ) (3.12).

In case of ℜǫ ≤ 0 we take the wn = 0, wn = w+ and wn = w− choices. In Table I we can
observe excellent convergence to the exact value in all cases. The choice of wn inﬂuences
only the speed of convergence.

In the region of ℜǫ ≥ 0, in complete accordance with Pincherle’s theorem, the contin-
ued fraction (5.9) diverges, only its analytic continuation with wn = w+ and wn = w− is
convergent. However, as the ﬁrst column in Table II shows, the convergence is rather poor.
This can considerably be improved by the repeated application of Bauer-Muir transforms.
In fact, an accuracy similar to the bound-state case can easily be reached here with e.g. an
eightfold Bauer-Muir transform.

In order that we have a more stringent test we have performed the contour integral

I(C) =

dǫ G00(ǫ).

2πi IC

(6.1)

If the domain surrounded by C does not contain any pole, then I(C) ≡ 0. If this domain
0i must hold, while if C circumvents
contains a single bound-state pole, then I(C) = h
the whole spectrum then I(C) = h
0i is expected. With appropriate selection of Gauss
integration points we could reach 12 digits accuracy in all cases. This demonstrates that
the calculation of the Green’s matrices from J-matrices via continued fractions is accurate
on the whole complex plane.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have shown that if in some basis representation the Hamiltonian takes a
Jacobi-matrix form the corresponding Green’s matrix can be calculated on the whole com-
plex energy plane by a continued fraction, whose coeﬃcients are related to the elements of
the Jacobi-matrix. To justify this statement we presented the example of the D-dimensional
Coulomb problem, in particular, we calculated the Coulomb–Sturmian-space representation
of the D-dimensional Coulomb Green’s operator. Numerical examples proved the accuracy
and the eﬃciency of the method.

The applicability of the techniques presented here can be extended beyond the examples
discussed above. We may have a physical situation in which only the asymptotic part of
the Hamiltonian has Jacobi-matrix structure. In this case, like in the L2 approach we can
approximate V by its projection V N onto a ﬁnite subspace spanned by the ﬁrst N basis
states and can generate the analytic Green’s matrix as a solution of a Lippmann–Schwinger
matrix equation (see e.g. in Ref. [8,9]). Also, our analytic two-body Green’s matrices may
be used to derive Green’s matrices of composite systems via convolution integrals based on
two-body problems.

12

It should be emphasized that we used the Jacobi-matrix form of a particular Hamil-
tonian only and the method is applicable to any Jacobi-matrix Hamiltonian if the matrix
elements are know analytically. This later requirement may be relaxed and thus we can de-
termine approximate Green’s matrices from J-matrices generated by the numerical Lanczos
procedure.

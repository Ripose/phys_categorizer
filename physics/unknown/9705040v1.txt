Abstract

A class of Fock representations of a four-parameter non-central
extension of the diﬀeomorphism algebra in N +1 dimensions is con-
structed, generalizing work of Eswara-Rao and Moody. The repre-
sentations act on trajectories in N -dimensional space, and functions
along such trajectories. Non-trivial relations and singular vectors are
found. Analogous representations of current algebras are also con-
structed. The Virasoro and Kac-Moody algebras are recovered when
N = 0.

1 Introduction

This paper concerns the algebra of diﬀeomorphisms in N +1-dimensional
space-time, dif f (N +1). The classical representations act on space-time
functions (more generally, tensor densities), which may be viewed in two
ways. First, as a ﬁnite-dimensional but non-linear realization acting on
space-time points, too small to be of interest in the construction of lowest-
energy representations. Alternatively, we can consider the linear but inﬁnite-
dimensional realization on function space. Now an energy can be deﬁned by
Fourier transformation with respect to an arbitrarily chosen time direction,
but this realization is too big to be useful, because the Fock construction

1

fails. More precisely, normal ordering formally gives rise to a central ex-
tension proportional to the number of time-independent functions, which is
inﬁnite except in 0 + 1 dimensions, where the Virasoro algebra is obtained.
This is in accordance with the appearently well-known fact that dif f (N +1)
does not admit central extensions except when N = 0.

The solution to this problem (on which I was stuck for almost a decade)
was obtained by Eswara-Rao and Moody [7], who started from a realization
which in size lies between the two above. Their work is restricted to certain
vertex representations for diﬀeomorphisms on a torus, but their ideas have
wider applicability. The purpose of the present paper is to rephrase their
results in arbitrary local coordinates, in order to extract the geometrical
meaning, and to generalize in several directions.
It turns out that they
considered the action of space-time diﬀeomorphisms on trajectories in space
(not space-time!), the extra time dimension being the parameter along the
trajectory. This realization is both non-linear and inﬁnite-dimensional, but
essentially smaller than space-time functions. The crucial observation is that
a trajectory is always one-dimensional, irrespective of the dimensionality of
space-time, and hence normal ordering is possible. The result is a certain non-
central extension of dif f (N +1). Albeit non-central, the extension is abelian
in the sense its various components commute among themselves, but not with
the diﬀeomorphism generators. The construction above can be generalized to
include functions along the trajectories (“trajectory ﬁelds”) and ﬁnitely many
transverse derivatives, in addition to the trajectories themselves, because the
property of having only one independent variable is not destroyed.

The situation is similar for the algebra of g-valued functions on space-
time, map(N +1, g). Earlier work on diﬀeomorphism algebras also include
[1], [3], [5], [6], [10], [13], [14], [19] and [20].

Section 2 contains some background information on Virasoro and Kac-
Moody algebras. This serves mainly to ﬁx notation and collect useful for-
mulas needed in subsequent sections. In section 3 we give the classical (new,
but not normal ordered) form of the dif f (N +1) action on trajectories. For
every representation of dif f (1) ⋉ map(1, gl(N +1)) we obtain a new repre-
sentation of dif f (N +1). Section 4 contains an explicit description of certain
non-central Lie algebra extensions of dif f (N +1), some of which are new. By
normal ordering the realization in section 3, we obtain in section 5 a Fock
representation of these Lie algebras for each representation of V ir⋉ \
gl(N +1),

2

thus considerably generalizing the vertex representations in [7].

Clearly, diﬀerential geometry on space-time can be phrased in the lan-
guage of dif f (N +1) modules. In section 6 we investigate how this observa-
tion can be generalized to trajectories. We prove a certain correspondence
between tensor ﬁelds and trajectory ﬁelds, which allows us to construct a
trajectory analog of almost every aspect of local diﬀerential geometry, while
retaining normal orderability. Some modules have a natural interpretation
as quantum theories of gravity.

As discussed in section 7, the same construction can be applied to current
algebras ([4], [8], [17]). Of particular interest here is the case so(N +1),
because trajectory analogs of the Dirac and Einstein-Cartan equations can
be constructed. An application to Mickelsson-Faddeev type extensions is
also discussed. Section 8 contains the construction of singular vectors in
some modules.

2 Preliminaries

We take space-time to be periodic in the temporal direction. This means
that generalized (operator-valued) functions on space-time may be expanded
in a Fourier series.

The operator ψ is a two-valued function of t, but any non-zero matrix element
consists of an even number of fermions and is thus single-valued. Analogous
modules can be constructed for several bosonic ﬁelds φi and fermionic ﬁelds

ﬁelds such as the connection, as well as for other algebras.

3 Classical representations

Now consider the algebra of diﬀeomorphisms in N +1-dimensional space-
time, dif f (N +1). Denote space-time points by x = (x0, xi) and the partial
derivative by ∂µ = ∂/∂xµ. Here and henceforth we use greek letters µ, ν =
0, 1, ..., N for space-time indices and latin letters i, j = 1, 2, ..., N for spatial

we consider vector ﬁelds which are polynomial in exp(ix0) and the spatial
coordinates xi, i.e. ﬁnite sums of monomials of the type

although most formulas presumably hold for more general vector ﬁelds. The
bracket of two vector ﬁelds ξ and η reads

4 The non-central extension

In this section we describe a seven-parameter non-central extension of dif f (N +1)
as an abstract Lie algebra. We denote this algebra by ]dif f(N +1; c1, c2, c3, c4;
a1, a2, a3), or simply ]dif f(N +1) if the parameters are understood. Only the
four parameters ci are cohomologically non-trival; the ai can be absorbed
into a redeﬁnition of the generators but are included for convenience.
A symmetrized n-tensor is an object that can be expanded as

f = fµ1..µn(x)dxµ1

dxµn,

..

◦

◦

(4.1)

where fµ1..µn(x) is some function of space-time, totally symmetric in all in-
dices, and the ring (
) denotes the symmetrized tensor product of diﬀeren-
◦
tials. This object transforms under dif f (N +1) as

Lξ, f ] = ℓξf

We refer to the various terms as extensions of type ci and ai, respectively.
The extension of type c1 was ﬁrst described in [7], whereas c2 was found by

17

this author using trial and error [13], [14]. The c3 and c4 types have not been
explicitly described before. Dzhumadildaev [3] has given an exhaustive list
of all cohomologically non-trivial extensions of dif f (N +1) by tensor density
modules. In his table 1, the c2 extension is denoted by ψW
1 ; strangely enough,
I have not been able to identify type c1. Moreover, two more cocycles in his
list are closely related to c1 and c2. Consider an operator Λ2(ω) deﬁned for
Lξ, Λ2(ω)] = Λ2(ℓξω). A
every two-form ω, with the dif f (N +1) action [
symmetric one-tensor f is also a one-form, and hence the following equality
can be written down.

(4.33)

4 and ψW

S1(f ) = Λ2(d∧f ),
where d∧ denotes the exterior derivative (not to be confused with the sym-
metric derivative d). With this substitution, the extensions of type c1 and
c2 give rise to Dzhumadildaev’s cocycles ψW
3 , respectively. The ex-
tensions of types c3 and c4 are not included in Dzhumadildaev’s list, because
of the operators in (4.31), only S1 transforms as a tensor density. More pre-
cisely, if we denote the smallest module containing Sn or Rn by the same
letter, we have the following inclusions

satisfy a certain Lie algebra extension of dif f (N +1). Although (4.47) is ill
deﬁned for n = 1, this algebra is not; it is the extension of type c4.

The explicit description of the extension immediately yields some con-
straints on the parameters in unitary representations. Consider the temporal

(4.46)

(4.47)

subalgebra generated by vector ﬁelds of the form ξ = ξ0(t)∂0. The extension
becomes

c1S1( ˙ξ0 ¨η0dt) + c2S1( ˙ξ0 ¨η0dt) + c3(R1( ˙η0dt, ˙ξ0dt) + S3( ˙ξ0 ¨η0dt3))

In view of the normalization (4.18), the temporal subalgebra is a Virasoro
algebra (2.10) with central charge cT emp, where

(4.48)

(4.49)

c1 + c2 + c3 + 2c4 =

cT emp
12

,

provided that we choose a2 = cT emp/24. Eq. (4.49) gives a necessary con-
dition on unitary representations of ]dif f(N +1). It is not clear if it is suﬃ-
cient; unitarity for ]dif f(N +1) may well be more restrictive than that of its
temporal subalgebra. Since ]dif f (1) coincides with its temporal subalgebra,
theorem 4.3 may be viewed as a natural higher-dimensional generalization of
the Virasoro algebra.

The spatial subalgebra is generated by vector ﬁelds satisfying ξ0 = ∂0ξi =

0. The last two types of extensions vanish and we are left with

ext(ξ, η) = c1S1(∂jξid∂iηj) + c2S1(∂iξid∂jηj).

(4.50)

We are now in the position to prove the non-triviality of the extensions of type
ci in theorem 4.3, by noting that the restriction to the temporal subalgebra is
the Virasoro algebra, which is a non-trivial extension of dif f (1). Moreover,
the ﬁrst two extension, which are included in Dzhumadildaev’s list, can not be
equivalent to the two others, because the restriction to the spatial subalgebra
(4.50) is diﬀerent.

Some ﬁnite-dimensional subalgebras are also of interest. Consider ﬁrst the
L−i∂µ which generates translations (the Hamilto-
µ, we see that ext(Pµ, η) = 0 for every vector
Lxµ∂ν . The cohomologically non-

momentum operator Pµ =

The temporal subalgebra is Virasoro algebra with central charge (4.49)

cT emp = c + 2N + 12(k1 + k2)

(5.24)

and the Hamiltonian has the same vacuum value as L0: hT emp = h. In a
unitary representation, cT emp > 2N.

The generators in theorem 5.5 act on the Fock space in a manifestly
consistent fashion. With the vector ﬁeld ξ of the form (3.1),
Lξ becomes an
inﬁnite sum of ﬁnite, normal-ordered monomials in the Fourier modes qi
m,
pjm, Lm and T µ
νm. However, only ﬁnitely many terms in this sum contain
no negative energy modes. The space of states obtained by acting on the
vacuum with ﬁnitely many positive energy modes is thus preserved by any
ﬁnite normal-ordered power of
Lξ, and matrix elements of any such operator
are ﬁnite.
This is a good point to compare our results with those obtained by
Eswara-Rao and Moody [7]. Consider the free Z-module on generators αM ,
M = 1, 2, .., ℓ + 2N. Set

δi = αℓ+i,

dj = αℓ+N +j,

6 Diﬀerential geometry of trajectories

We will now show that the non-linear realization in theorem 3.2 corresponds
to tensor ﬁelds (3.5) in the sense of deﬁnition 3.1. Since diﬀerential geometry
largely is the theory of tensor ﬁelds, we expect that it possesses a trajectory
analog. This analogy is pursued here.

In this section, we ignore normal ordering and work with the classical
generators of theorem 3.2, but the results are relevant also for Fock modules.

To distinguish between the two diﬀerent kinds of weights, we refer to λ as
the causal weight and to κ as the ordinary weight.

(λ, ω; κ, p, q) is not a dif f (N +1) module by itself, since the transfor-
(q) and

mation law involves the trajectory qi(t). However,

(λ, ω; κ, p, q)

(λ, ω; κ, p, q)

By theorem 3.2, every dif f (1) ⋉ map(1, gl(N +1)) module is a dif f (N +1)
metamodule. Submetamodules and metamodule maps are deﬁned in the
obvious fashion.

Here and henceforth in this section we suppress the time dependence.

The last three terms prevent the time derivative from being a primary ﬁeld.

homogeneously, since the time derivative shifts the causal weight by one. To
compensate for this, we introduce a priviledged scalar trajectory ﬁeld, the

gl(N +1) connection (2.35) to represent dif f (1) and map(1, gl(N +1)), re-

weight do not seem to correspond to tensor ﬁelds in any natural fashion. Cor-
respondence can also be applied to more complicated objects; e.g, the trajec-
tory connection of type III corresponds to the ordinary connection (Cristoﬀel
symbol).

We may now ask what corresponds to the derivative of a tensor ﬁeld. Since
a trajectory ﬁeld depends on one variable only, it can contain no information
about derivatives transverse to the trajectory. This is a necessary price for
normal orderability, but it is nevertheless fruitful to introduce the concept of
a partial derivative φ,µ by enlarging the set of ﬁelds.

as for ordinary tensor ﬁelds, consists of noting that anti-symmetry makes

The derivative can be extended to the product of two (not necessarily
primary) trajectory ﬁelds by Leibniz’ rule. This is consistent with (6.31),

The derivative can further be extended to an arbitrary polynomial in trajec-
tory ﬁelds and their derivatives by linearity and Leibniz’ rule. This polyno-
mial will transform in the same fashion as the corresponding tensor expres-
sion.
In particular, if the tensor expression transforms homogeneously, so
does its trajectory analog, and it may consistently be put to zero.

the covariant derivative does furnish a representation of dif f (N +1). The

The original ﬁelds (qi, pj; φ, α; φ,ν, α,µ) were restricted to (qi, ˜pj; φ, ˜α; φ,j, ˜α,i)
in (6.36). In the general case, we only write down equations for the ﬁelds,
because the canonical momenta are automatically eliminated.

p2 = m2. Note that it is not possible to impose conditions
involving the momentum pj(t) itself, because that would not commute
with the other constraints which depend on qi(t). Eq. (6.51) can be

Due to the non-linear nature of the Einstein equation, we have not been

be given. Consider ﬁrst the case n = 1. The Einstein equation is of second

Finally we note that an analogous construction can be carried out for the

undeﬁned. Apart from these modiﬁcations, the corresponding construction
for tensor ﬁelds goes through, yielding a dif f (N +1) action on the set of
solutions to classical gravity in empty space.

Equations (8.32) and (8.34) yield suﬃcient conditions for the existence of a
singular vector of the form (8.33) in the module

(rB(n)).

We stress that these modules, with singular vectors modded out, are
perfectly well deﬁned. However, it would be desirable to describe them more
explicitly; in particular we want to express the lowest energy h in terms of
the parameters κ and ω. To make progress, we make the following

Assumption: The temporal subalgebra acts as a Virasoro algebra with
the independent primary ﬁelds listed in (7.21): B(n) fermions ψ,i1..in with
conformal weight κ and shift ω, and C(n) bosons eI
µ,i1..in with λ =
ω = 0.

µ,i1..in−1, eI

This assumption is not completely unjustiﬁed. Indeed, we saw in section
6 that the derivative condition (6.31) could be solved explicitly (6.36), and

60

the restriction to the temporal subalgebra (6.38) gave precisely the analogous
result. If the assumption is true, the Virasoro parameters have independent
contributions from the vielbein and fermion sectors: cT emp = ce + cψ and
hT emp = he + hψ. It can be shown that a single boson contributes

he = 0.

The central charge of the temporal algebra is not so interesting, although it
can be used to distinguish between inequivalent modules; the prime motiva-
tion for considering the temporal subalgebra is that it gives an expression
for the Hamiltonian eigenvalue h. Equations (8.17), (8.32), (8.34) and (8.37)
(r) (modulo the assumption
now give reducibility conditions for the module
above).

where cV ir and hV ir label the discrete series of irreducible Virasoro represen-

]dif f(2) modules whose restriction to (4.57) yield the Virasoro discrete series,
e.g. the ]dif f(2) module induced from V ir
V ir. It appears that we have
constructed such ]dif f (2) modules.

However, there is an embarresment of riches. For other values of ℓ, e.g.
the simpler choice ℓ = 1, there are singular vectors that do not correspond to

Physically, it is quite natural that a ]dif f (2) module isomorphic to the
two-dimensional Ising model exists. From a passive point of view, a diﬀeo-
morphism is simply a coordinate transformation; an object is a ]dif f (N +1)
representation if it is generally covariant, rather than an artifact of the choice
of coordinate system. It appears to me that every sensible object living in
N +1 dimensions must have this property; in particular, it should be true
also for the three-dimensional Ising model. By analogy with the N = 1 case,
it seems natural that its critical exponents could be found by solving (8.17),
(8.32), (8.34) and (8.37) with N = 2; however, numerical attempts indicate
that this hypothesis is false.

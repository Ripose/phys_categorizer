Particle symbols and Feynman diagrams often used in particle physics can be generated by a 
word document processor. Standard office packages have their built in symbols such as solid-
line,  dashed-line,  arrows,  etc.  which  are  also  used  in  particle  physics.    Three  symbols 
corresponding  to  photon,  gluon  and  fermion  line  are  not  present  in  the  standard  office 
packages. By importing these two symbols and using the built in symbols, tree-level Feynman 
diagrams can be easily generated in an office program.  
 
1. Particle Symbols 
 
This is a simple guide to generate a Feynman diagram [1] in Openoffice.org [2] or other office 
packages [3,4]. Standard office packages have their own symbols and more can be generated 
easily  by using the drawing toolbar  menu. Furthermore, selecting  more than one symbols or 
drawings can be grouped into a figure.  
 
Some  of  the  particle  symbols  used  in  particle  physics  to  draw  Feynman  diagrams  are  not 
present standard drawing toolbar menu. We need to be supply these symbols from an external 
input. Most used symbols in quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics 
(QCD) are photon and gluon, respectively. These symbols are shown in Table I.

2. Feynman Diagram   
 
A  Feynman  diagram  corresponding  to  a 
process can be formed by copying and/or 
rotating  the  above  symbols  according  to 
related  physics  model.  As  an 
the 
example, a diagram for the process γq(cid:198) 
gq  is shown in Fig. 1. A different size of 
these  symbols  can  be  obtained  by 
clicking on the object and pulling out

from  the  corner.  Orientation  of  these  symbols  can  be  changed  by  rotating  it  around  their 
centers.  After  a  careful  drawing  and  linearization  of  the  diagram,  a  publication  quality 
Feynman diagram can  be obtained. The diagram  can  be converted to other  formats such as 
postscript  (PS) or  printer  file  (PRN)  using  a  postscript  printer  driver  and  the  “print  to  file” 
facility of the office package. Furthermore using the program Ghostview [5], the file with an 
extension PS or PRN can be converted to an encapsulated postscript (EPS) or a PNG figure 
file providing the original file must be a single page document. 
 
 
3. Conclusion 
 
This  simple  guide  for  Feynman  diagram  drawing  in  office  packages  can  be  used  and 
distributed  without  changing  its  original  form.  For  a  colourful  example,  see  some  particle 
symbols and Feynman digrams in the APPENDIX A. Upon usage of these symbols, it should 
be referred to the preprint number physics/0411006.

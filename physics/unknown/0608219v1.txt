Studies  on  polymeric  metal  compounds  are  receiving  more  and 
more  attention  in  recent  years  due  to  their  properties,  which  lie 
isolated  molecules  and  bulk  material.1  The  major 
between 
developments  in  this  area  are  synthesis  of  conducting  polymeric 
materials and metal cluster trapped within the channels of zeolite.2, 3 
In  recent  years  bimetallic  compounds  containing  alkali  metal 
  synthesized.1a  For  example,  gallium

phosphonates have been shown to form cages containing  lithium,1a 
sodium, and potassium4 ions with short metal-metal contacts. In the 
lithium  compound  the  lithium  ions  are  arranged  in  a  finite 
unidimensional wire. These compounds are potential precursors for 
preparation of ion conductors and molecular sieves. 1a

in  alkali  metal  complexes  of

cesium  compound,  a  helical  1D  infinite  chain  of  [Cs2  (Mo2O5L2). 
H2O]n.5  We  were  interested  in  exploring  methods  for  assembly  of 
larger  cluster.  We  report  here  synthesis  and  structure  of  a  new 
metalloligand and its sodium complex [Na2MoO3L(H2O)]n (1) {L = 
iminodiacetate},  which  contains  infinite  one  dimensional  chain  of 
hexagonal sodium ions with short Na – Na contacts and theoretical 
investigation (DFT calculation) of the stability and reactivity of that 
compound .

Our  synthetic  strategy  is  to  use  a tridentate,  dibasic ligand  (L), 
containing two carboxylate donor sites, that is expected to form the 
metalloligand,  [LMoO2(μ-O)MoO2L]2-  or  [LMoO3]2-.    The  Ligand 
has a potential to coordinate alkali – metal cations through bridging 
carboxylate and self-assemble into various architectures.  

Accordingly,  a  reaction  of  Na2MoO4.  2H2O  and  iminodiacetic 
acid  has  been  carried  out  in  water  and  the  compound  1  has  been 
isolated  in  high  yield.  The  compound  has  been  characterized  by 
(TGA),  and 
elemental  analyses,

spectroscopic  studies  as  well  as  a  single  crystal  X-ray  diffraction 
studies. 

X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that, the asymmetric unit of 1 
contains half of the molybdenum coordinated iminodiacetate, two –
oxo oxygens, two sodium, and one water as it sits on the inversion 
centre.  The  molybdenum  atom 
is  in  a  distorted  octahedral 
environment  and  is  coordinated  to  three  –oxo  oxygens  and  two 
carboxylate  oxygens  and  a  nitrogen  (Figure  1a).  Each  of  the  two 
carboxylates  of  the  ligand  bridge  one  molybdenum  atom  and  two 
sodium (Na2). Each of the three Mo=O oxygens bridges two sodium 
ions in a μ3 fashion (Figure 1b). In addition, the two sodium ions are 
bridged by one μ2-oxygen of water. Thus, each of the sodium ions is 
hexacoordinated and is in an distorted octahedral environment.  The 
distinctive feature of the structure is the formation of hexagonal 1D 
chain  of  sodium  ions  (Figure  2).  The  observed  Na….Na  distances 
{Na1…Na1  =  3.074  (4)  Å  and  Na1….Na2  =  3.2733  (18)  Å}  are 
distinctly shorter compared to that in elemental sodium (3.82 Å).

slightly  longer  Na….Na  contacts  in    galophosphonates  containing 
sodium ions.4Another, interesting feature of the 1D chain is that, the 
hexagonal ring (Na6) is almost planer like benzene {∠Na1 Na1 Na2 
= 123.83 (4) and ∠Na2 Na1 Na2 = 112.34 (8) }. Interestingly, the 
compound forms a porous 3D network through bridging carboxylate 
groups (Figure 3).    

The  observed  geometry  of  the  (Na6)  units  in  the  1D  chain 
prompted  us  to  investigate  the  characteristics  of  this  cluster 
theoretically  and  look  for  a  possible  aromatic  behavior.  In  recent 
years, all metal aromaticity has attracted a great deal of attention.7 A 
few  organometallic  all  metal  aromatic  compounds  have  been 
reported.7e Apart form these report, the major focus has been on the 
gas  phase  synthesis  and  theoretical  studies  on  aluminium  cluster.7  
Starting  from  the  experimental  geometry  of  (Na4n  +  2),  n  =  1  –  5, 
clusters  single  point  calculations  have  been  performed  at  the 
B3LYP/6-311+G* (for n = 1 – 4) and B3LYP/6-31G* (for n =  5) 
levels  of  theory.  In  the  case  of  n  =  5  the calculated  values did  not 
converge  and  thus  in  this  case  the  B3LYP/6-31G*  level  of  theory 
has been used. For all C4n+2H2n+4, n=1-5, B3LYP/6-311+G* basis set 
is  used.  The  electronic  properties  were  also  calculated  at  the 
B3LYP/LanL2DZ  level  of  theory.  It  has  been  found  that,  except 
absolute  values,  the  trends  of  various  electronic  properties  remain 
same  as  those  calculated  using  B3LYP/LanL2DZ  level  of  theory 
(supplementary  material).  Various  electronic  properties  like  energy 
(E),  hardness  (η)8,  polarizability  (α)9,  eletrophilicity  (ω)10,  and 
nucleus  independent  chemical  shift  at  the  ring  center  {NICS(0)}11 
have been calculated using standard techniques.12 Figure 4 presents 
the  plots  of  E,  η,  α,  and  ω  of  (Na4n  +  2),  n  =  1  to  5  clusters.  The 
overall  cluster  gets  softer,  more  polarizable  and  more  electrophilic 
as  n  increases.  Corresponding  plots  per  (Na6)  unit  are  shown  in 
Figure 5, which provides more transparent view of the stability and 
reactivity.  As  the  chain  length  increases,  its  energy  per  (Na6)  unit 
increases and the hardness decreases as expected from the maximum 
hardness  principle.13  This  implies  that,  the  average  reactivity 
increases  with  the  increase  in  chain  length.  Except  for  one  or  two 
smallest clusters, the observed trend of variation in α and  ω are as 
expected  form  the  principles  of  the  minimum  polarizability14  and

structure  principles  have  been  shown  to  be  adequate  in  explaining 
the  aromatic  and  antiaromatic  behaviour  of  all  metal  compounds16 
4-  or  the  prototypical  organic  analogues  like 
like  Al4
benzene  and  cyclobutadiene.17  In  order  to  check  the  possible 
aromatic character of the Na4n+2 clusters, their NICS(0) values have 
been  calculated  and  compared  with  those  values  (B3LYP/6-
311+G*)  of  the  corresponding  linear  arenes.18  The  comparison  is 
shown  in  Figure  6.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that,  these  (Na4n  +  2), 
clusters  exhibit  striking  resemblance,  in  their  aromatic  behaviour, 
with  that  of  linear  polyacenes.  Not  only  their  NICS  (0)  values  are 
comparable,  “the  more  reactive  inner  rings  actually  are  more 
aromatic  than  the less reactive outer rings and even more aromatic 
than  benzene  itself”19  for  the  linear  arenes  as  well  as  (Na4n  +  2) 
clusters.  

In  conclusion,  a  unique  hexagonal  chain  of  sodium  has  been 
synthesized  and  structurally  characterized.  The  DFT  calculations 
show  that,  the  (Na6)  rings  in  the  chain  are  highly  aromatic  in 
character and the NICS(0) values of the Na6 rings are almost same 
as their polyacene analogues. The stability and reactivity pattern of 
the Na6 rings also follow the same pattern as their organic analogues. 
Thus, the inorganic Na6 chain shows organic like aromaticity.

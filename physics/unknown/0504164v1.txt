In this paper it  is demonstrated that a  1/f power spectrum appears in the process originated by the 
superposition of many similar single-sided RTN processes with the same relaxation time. The non-
relaxed  regime,  the  Gaussian  nature  and  the  average  periodicity  of  the  resulting  fluctuation,  are 
responsible for the generation of  1/f noise, thanks to the coincidences of these RTN processes. The 
decomposition  of  the  resulting  fluctuation  in  a  set  of  further  single-sided  RTN  processes  with  a 
distribution of the relaxation times,  permits  us  to demonstrate once more the generation of the  1/f 
noise. 
 
1.  Introduction 
 
The main feature of  1/f  noise  is  that  its  power  spectrum  increases  with  decreasing 
frequency  f  down  to  the  lowest  possible  frequencies  for  conducting  measurements. 
This  noise  is  therefore  spectrally  scaling,  that  is,  it  is  statistically  identical  to  its 
transformation by contraction in time or another independent variable, followed by a 
corresponding change in intensity. This scaling property is typical of the  fractals [1] 
and it reveals the presence of long-term correlations. 
Despite  great  progress  being  made  in  1/f  noise  physics  the  source  of  these 
fluctuations remains unknown in the case of most systems and the problem remains 
largely unsolved in its generality. 
 It would be too lengthy to report all references concerning 1/f noise but an extensive 
bibliography has been drawn up in [2]. 
 The aim of this contribution is to furnish further focus and explanation, in respect to 
a previous work [3], to go back to the origin and the essence of the 1/f noise.  
  We  shall  see  that  a  1/f  power  spectrum  appears  in  the  resulting  fluctuation  from 
many,  microscopic  or  macroscopic,  similar  single-sided  RTN  (random  telegraph 
noise)  processes  with  the  same  relaxation  time,  tanks  to  a  surprising  cooperative 
process.  
In the following, we refer only to time phenomena.  
 
 
2.  Role of the coincidences  
 
Consider N similar two-state processes generated by the random presence, and by the 
absence, of a same physical  object (one electron,  one photon,  one car, etc). These 
processes can be represented by the two-level independent variables  u1, u2, u3, …, uN 
having the same: amplitude  u, probability  p and relaxation time  t (the average time 

 

 

 

1 

spent in a level before making a transition to the other or the inverse of the total rate 
of transitions back and forth in the process).  
 The variable  ui appears as a single-sided RTN process which ranges from the value 
zero to the value u.  
  Consider  the  number  c of  coincidences  which  result  in  the  superposition  of    the 
processes  ui.    These  coincidences  correspond  to  the  number  of  contemporary  high   
levels during  the sampling time D T, while the entire measurement time is T. 
Call P(c) the probability of c coincidences in the interval  D T. 
 If  U  represents the summation of all the  ui processes, we call  D U  the  double-sided 
fluctuation  of  U  from  the  mean  U   and  D c  the  corresponding  double-sided 
fluctuation of c from the mean  c . 
  The statistics which govern the probability  P(c)  is binomial, where the processes ui 
generate N independent trials. The memory of the processes  ui does not compromise 
the final distribution of the coincidences,  for it depends only from the probability  p 
and from N, although this memory is transmitted to the resulting process D U. 
 
2.1. Biunique correspondence 
 
  The  particularity  of  the  amplitudes  D U  is  their  biunique  correspondence  with  the 
coincidences, thanks  to  the  single-sided  originating  processes.  In  other  words,  the 
values of  U are discrete and they can be reached only through the eventuality of  c = 
U/u coincidences, while the fluctuation D U requires an increment D c=D U/u from  c .  
 In this respect, we note that also in the simple case of RTN double-sided originating 
processes  this  biunique  correspondence  does  not  appear,  due  to  the  impossibility  to 
go back to the number of coincidences causing the fluctuations. 
 
2.2. Rarity of the fluctuations 
 
 In the case of a number sufficiently high of originating RTN processes, the biunique 
correspondence of U with c is responsible of the rarity of the fluctuations D U of great 
amplitude, in comparison to fluctuations of the same amplitude generated by random 
variables of continuous type. In fact, in this latter case, the same value of  D U can be 
reached by various and different combinations of the generating processes and not by 
a unique possibility.  
 For example, supposing to have one hundred of RTN single-sided processes with p = 
0.5  and  t  =  1ms, the probability of  the coincidence of all hundred processes during  
1ms,  corresponds,  on  average,  to  one  possibility  in  about  4(cid:215)   1016  years,  when  the 
retained age of the Universe is 2(cid:215)  109 years. 
 The rarity of the fluctuations explains also, as we shall see, the long-term memory.

2.3. Periodic structure of the average process 
 
 The  crucial  role  of  the  coincidences is  the  locking  of  the  originating  process. This 
locking is  responsible of  the convergence of the  resulting random process  D U to an 
average  periodic  process.  Indeed,  the  locking  of  c  processes  requires  the 
contemporary  locking  of  the  fluctuations  related  to  c-1,  c-2,  …  ,  c-  (c-1) 
coincidences, permitting to the process D U to reach averagely a self-similar periodic 
structure. 
 The  fundamental  frequency  of  this  average  process  is  the  inferior  limit  of  the 
bandwidth  of  the  process  itself.  On  the  contrary,  the  resulting  fluctuations  from 
originating  processes  different  from  single-sided  RTN  ones  cannot  converge  to  a 
periodic signal due to the lack of biunique correspondence between c and D U. 
 Fig.A  and  Fig.B  display  as  the  coincidences  of  five  single-sided  similar  RTN 
processes work to create the resulting process D U. 
 
2.4. Waveform of the fluctuations 
 
 The fluctuation D U, as we can see in Fig.A and Fig.B (page 12), show the following 
characteristics:  

1.  The  average  structure  is  self-similar  “fractal”  and  reveals  a  self-organization 

process such as the generation of one-dimension sand-piles [4]. 
     2.  The amplitude of the fluctuations scales inversely with their frequency. 
     3.  The  duration  (or  the  probability  p)  of  the  fluctuations  at  the  same  level  of 

amplitude appears decreasing as their average frequency.  

     4. The waveform of  D U  is  represented  by  symmetrical spikes whose sharpening 
naturally  evolves  with  the  number  of  the  coincidences.  This  waveform  is 
similar to the simulated signal in ref. [5] having a power spectrum proportional 
to 1/f. 
 

2.5. Gaussian distribution 
 
 When the number of the originating RTN processes  is high, and the probability  p is 
not too small, the binomial distribution approaches the Gaussian distribution.  In any 
case,  the  Gaussian  distribution  can  be  reached  also  thanks  to  the  central  limit 
theorem. Therefore, if s ? c
 

2 is the variance of  the distribution, it results

 Under the experimental point of view, we conduct measurements only during a finite 
time T. So, on T/D T alternatives there can be various values of power which have the 
same  probability  P(D Ui)  (ratio  of  the  number  of  the  favourable  trials  ni  with  the 
number of the possible trials ntot = T/D T). Hence, D U1 
2 represents the average power 
of the events which have the same ratio n1 / ntot  = P(D U1) in the time T.  
 
  
3.  Relaxed and non-relaxed regime 
 
 In  general,  the  relaxation  time  of  a  process  is  the  time  t  necessary  to  its 
autocorrelation function to decrease of a factor 1/e . 
 Hence, a process U can result relaxed or non-relaxed depending on the measurement 
time  T.  Indeed,  the  process  appears  relaxed  if  the  measurement  time  exceeds  its 
relaxation time (T > t), otherwise the process is non-relaxed (T < t).  
  We recall that, in the case of generating RTN processes, t is also the inverse of the 
total rate of transitions back and forth in the process [2]. Therefore, if a fluctuation 
of  discrete  amplitude  ? U  does  not  reappear  within  the  measurement  time  T,  the 
process is non-relaxed because T < t. 
Considering the example of   Sec. 2.2, and supposing ten  generating RTN processes, 
the  coincidence  of  all  ten  these  processes  will  appear  averagely  every  millisecond. 
So,  with  T  >  1ms  the  process  will  be  relaxed,  but  with  T  <  1ms  the  process will 
become  non-relaxed,  while  with  one  hundred  of  processes    the  resulting  process 
appears non-relaxed for any experimental T. 
 On  the  contrary,  when  a  process  results  from  the  summation  of  many  independent 
continuous random variables its regime is practically relaxed for any experimental T, 
due to the high statistics of the fluctuations and to the lack of memory of the process.

3.1. Relaxation and memory 
 
  The  relaxation  time  of  a  process  is  accepted  to  represents  its  memory  time. 
Therefore,  if  a  fluctuation  of  discrete  amplitude  ?U  does  not  reappear  within  the 
measurement time  T,  the  memory  of  this  fluctuation  is  not  lost.  Hence,  the process 
? U generated by  many RTN processes, with the same relaxation time shows a long-
term memory, due to the presence of the rare fluctuations. 
 The  long-term  memory  results  also  from  the  possibility  to  decompose  the  ? U  
process  in  a  set  of  single-sided  processes  with  a  distribution  of  relaxation  times 
(Sec.6). 
 Instead,  a  process  without  memory  (white  noise)  will  be  always  relaxed  for  any 
experimental  T,  while  a  relaxed  process  not  necessarily  implies  a  process  without 
memory (Sec.4). 
 
3.2. Non-relaxation and bandwidth  
 
 The sampling time D T limits the bandwidth of the process D U at fs = 1/(2? T) and the 
measurement time  T  does  not  permit  the  detection  of  spectral  components  with  a 
frequency lower than fT =1/(2T).  
  Therefore, the measurement time  T,  and the sampling time  D T, filter the spectral 
components of a process D U.  
In addition to the limits introduced by D T and T, the bandwidth of the process is also 
determined by the bandwidth  f2  < f < f1 of the measuring device, which interferes in 
various  ways  with  the  interval  fT  ,  fs.  For  instance,  if  f2  is  the  inferior  limit  of  the 
  f2, or 1/(2T) £
bandwidth, it is necessary have fT £
 In conclusion, to be sure to conduct measurements in the non-relaxed regime, it must 
be T < t, then 1/T > t -1, namely 
 
                                                       t -1 < 2fT = 1/T.                                       (6) 
 
 
4. The power spectrum of the fluctuations  
 
We  are  interested  to  determine  the  power  spectrum  of  the  fluctuations  D U  of  U. 
Therefore, it is useful to analyse these fluctuations in the relaxed regime and to see 
the difference with the non-relaxed regime.

  In Eq.(7) the terms with  i=j correspond to the autocorrelation functions of the single 
processes ui  ,  while  the  other  terms  (i„  j)    are  responsible  for  the  cross-correlation 
contributions to U. In general we can write 
 
                                        
 
where  y a(q)  denotes  the  identical  autocorrelation  function  for  each  involved  ui  
process and y c(q) the  identical cross-correlation function between any two different 
ui  processes. 
 As the processes ui are uncorrelated, but non-orthogonal 
 
                                           
 
Therefore the  average power of U will be

 Eq.(13) confirms that, in the frequency domain, the dc components of the originating 
processes introduce still a dc component in the resulting process, while for any other 
frequency the power spectrum results from the summation of the single power spectra 
of the processes ui.  
 Hence, being Lorentzian the power spectrum of the originating RTN  processes in a 
relaxed regime, the power spectrum of the resulting process ? U, in the same regime, 
will be still Lorentzian. 
  As a consequence, the power spectrum of  D U will can be of 1/f type only during a 
non-relaxed regime. 
 
4.2. Non-relaxed regime 
 
 This  regime  appears  when  the  measurement  time  T  does  not  permit  to  the 
fluctuations  D U,  with  a  average  frequency  lower  than  fT =  1/(2T),  to  appear    with 
repetition. Hence, the autocorrelation function does not relax and the process does not 
loss its memory within T. Therefore, the resulting process of many similar originating 
RTN processes  will  be  always  non-relaxed  within  experimental  measurement  times 
and its power spectrum will be different from a Lorentzian.    
  
 
5.  1/f  power spectrum and Gaussian distribution  
  
We have seen that the process D U, derived from the summation of many independent 
RTN processes,  follows a Gaussian distribution and it  is almost always non-relaxed, 
within  experimental  measurement  times  (or  equivalent  bandwidth)  due  to  the  rare 
coincidences. On the other hand, the law of large numbers allows us to introduce an 
average  frequency  of  the  coincidences  proportional  to  their  probabilities,  thereby 
enabling  us  to  substitute,  in  the  Eq.  (5),  the  discrete  probability  P(D U)  with  the 
discrete frequency f = P(D U)/D T.   
 In the frequency domain Eq. (5) becomes

6. 1/f  power spectrum by summation of many similar RTN processes 
 
Fig. 1A shows a simple example of fluctuation D U, due a summation of similar RTN 
processes of amplitude u, where the maximum amplitude of the fluctuations is limited 
to D U=5u and the process is viewed only on side of the fluctuations D U .  
We see in Fig.C that  D U can also be generated by an equivalent set of similar RTN 
processes of amplitude u and with a relaxation time which scales as D U.  
 Each of these processes has its own relaxation time  t ? c, probability  p? c (in the high 
level) and it  is in biunique correspondence with D c of average frequency  f? c . 
 The  relaxation time t ? c obeys the relationship

those of Fig.C, since they are single-sided. 
 In the case of a superposition of many RTN processes with a continuous distribution 
of the relaxation times, S(w ) has to be averaged over this distribution with a function 
weight  p(t)  dt  which  includes  the  contribution  to  the  variance  of  processes  whose 
relaxation time lies in the interval from  t to t + dt . Supposing we have  p(t) (cid:181)
 1/t in 
-1   and zero outside this interval, one has S(w ) (cid:181)

  This result has been possible thanks to the following conditions: 
 

1.  The  fluctuations  D U  are  originated  by  RTN  processes  of  the  same 
amplitude, so they can be decomposed by  one set of RTN processes of the 
same amplitude with a distribution of relaxation times. 
2.  The non-relaxed regime is guaranteed  by the condition t2

-1 << 2p f, namely  

-1 < 2f  [see Eq.(6)] and this requires a measurement time T=1/(2f).  

t2

 
 Now, these  conditions can be respected if the  fluctuations D U are just generated by 
the  coincidences  of  many  originating  RTN  processes,  with  the  same  amplitude  and 
relaxation time.  
 It is evident in Fig.B that the long-term memory  results also by  the presence, in the 
equivalent set of RTN processes, with a relaxation time increasing with the decrease 
of the average frequency of D U.  
 At  least,  the  1/f  power  spectrum  conducts  to  a  Gaussian  distribution  of  the 
fluctuations  D U  through  the  reverse  of  the  path  described  in  Sec.5.  Indeed,  the 
average power of the fluctuation D U in the frequency range fmax , f1 will be

7.  Serial 1/f noise 
 
 A  serial  single-sided  RTN  process  is  very  common  in  nature,  for  example  the 
sequential flow, along the same path, of identical objects such as electrons, photons, 
cars, etc.  
 If  D
t  is  the  minimum  time  necessary  to  detect  one  object  which  flows    through  a 
cross-section of the path, N = T/D T  represents the number of attempts in the time T.  
 If p is the probability of detecting one of these objects in time D T then the probability 
P(n) to detect n objects in the time T follows the binomial distribution. 
  In  particular,  if  the  objects  have  the  same  velocity,  the  time  T  can  be  viewed  as   
space S. 
 When  N  is  large  and  the  probability  p  is  not  very  small,  P(n)  will  follow  the 
Gaussian distribution, so

 Thanks to the  law of large numbers, the mean frequency  f of the fluctuations D n is 
proportional to their probabilities and therefore we can substitute P(n) with f . In fact 
f = P(D n) / D T and fmax= P(D n)max/D T. 
 D n2  represents    the  average  power  of  the  fluctuations  D n  of  average  frequency  f 
which spectral components lie in the range f,fmax .  
Thus, as in Sec.6, we introduce the power spectrum S? n(f) such that

8.  Conclusions 
 
  In this paper it has been demonstrated that 1/f noise is produced when a superposition 
exists of many similar single-sided RTN processes. This result is possible thanks: 

•  the  non-relaxed  regime  of  the  resulting  process  D U,  guaranteed  by  an 
measurement  time  shorter  than  the  relaxation  time,  or  by  the  equivalent 
bandwidth; 

•  the Gaussian distribution of the fluctuations D U; 
•  the periodic average structure of D U.    

   The  resulting  process  D U  can be  also  decomposed  by  an  equivalent  set  of  RTN 
processes with relaxation  time scaling as the amplitude of the fluctuations  D U. This 
set  of  RTN  processes,  with  a  distribution  of  relaxation  times, permits to  operate on 
the  frequency  range  of  a  the  non-relaxed  regime  D U  and  to  find  an  1/f  power 
spectrum. In this case the Gaussian  distribution derives as a consequence of an exact 
1/f noise.

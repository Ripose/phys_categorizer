The paper presents an investigation of local-time effect - one of the manifestations of macroscopic 
fluctuations phenomena. Was shown the existence of the named effect for longitudinal distance 
between locations of measurements up to 500 meters. Also a structure of intervals distribution in 
neighborhood of local-time peak was studied and splitting of the peak was found out. Obtained results 
lead to conclusion about sharp anisotropy of space-time. 
 
 
 

 
1. Introduction. 
 
Present work was carried out as further investigations of macroscopic fluctuations phenomena 
[1 – 4]. The local time effect, which is the main subject of this paper, is synchronous in local 
time appearance of pairs of histograms with similar fine structure constructed on the base of 
measurements  of  fluctuations  in  processes  of  different  nature  fulfilled  in  different 
geographical  locations.  The  effect  points  out  on  the  dependence  of  fine  structure  of  the 
histograms on the Earth rotations around its axis and around the Sun. The existence of local 
time effect was studied for different distances between places of measurement from hundred 
kilometers up to highest possible on the Earth distances (~ 15000 km). The goal of the present 
work is the investigations of the existence of the local time effect for relatively small distances 
between places of measurements. 

The main problem of experimental investigations of local-time effect at the small space 
distances  is  resolution  enhancement  of  the  macroscopic  fluctuations  method.  As  a  rule  all 
above-mentioned  investigations  of  local-time  effect  were  carried  out  by  using  α-decay  rate 
fluctuations of 239Pu source. But such source of fluctuations becomes uselessness for distances 
in tens of kilometers or less when histograms duration must be about one second or less. By 
this reason in the present work we refuse α-decay sources of fluctuations. As such a source 
was  chosen  noise  generated  by  germanium  semiconductor  diode.  Such  source  gives  noise 
signal  with  frequency  band  up  to  tens  of  megahertz  and  because  of  this  satisfies  the 
requirements of present investigations.  

To  check  convenience  of  selected  noise  source  for  local-time  effect  investigations  it 
was tested on distances for which existence of the effect was proved [5]. In cited work was 
shown appropriateness of semiconductor noise diode for studies of local-time effect.

∆l, equal ∆l=15 km.  

Fluctuations  from  noise  generator  were  digitized  with  sampling  frequency  equal  to 
44100 Hz. In this way in Pushchino and Bolshevik were obtained 10-minute time series. From 
this  initial  time  series  with  three  different  steps  (pointed  in  second  line  of  Table 1)  were 
extracted single measurements and obtained three time series with frequency pointed in third 
line of Table 1. On the base of this time series in a standard way [1-3] were constructed three 
sets of histograms. All histograms were constructed using sample length pointed in fourth line 
of  Table 1.  Number  of  histograms  per  second  and  durations  of  histogram  for  every  set  are 
given in the fifth and sixth line of Table 1 correspondingly.

Fig. 1  presents  intervals  distribution  obtained  after  expert  comparisons  of  1-sec  histogram 
sets. The distribution has a peak, which corresponds to time interval equal to 63±1 sec. Taking 
into  account  accuracy  of  synchronization  of  measurements  beginning  (0.1 - 0.2 sec)  and 
duration of histograms one can consider this peak to be corresponding with good accuracy to 
local time difference ∆t = 62.7 sec between places of measurements. 

Local time peak ordinary obtained on the interval distributions is very sharp and consists 
of  1-2  histograms  [1-3]  i.e.  is  practically  structureless.  Peak  on  the  Fig. 1 a)  also  can  be 
considered  as  structureless.  This  fact  leads  us  to  the  problem  of  further  investigating  of 
structure of local time peak. 

The  fact  that  all  sets  of  histograms  were  obtained  on  the  base  of  the  same  initial  time 
series enables enhancement of time resolution of the method of investigation. Using of 0.2-sec 
histograms  set  (forth  column  of  Table 1)  increase  resolution  in  five  times  and  allows  more 
detailed  investigations  of  local-time  peak  structure.  Since  the  positions  of  the  peak  on  the 
intervals distribution (Fig. 1) are known it is possible to select their neighborhood by means of 
60 sec  relative  shift  of  initial  time  series  and  prepare  after  this  0.2-sec  histograms  set  for 
further expert comparison. 

Intervals distribution obtained in result of expert comparisons for 0.2-sec histograms set 
is presented on Fig. 1b). One can see that maximum similarity of histograms shape is observed 
for pairs of histograms separated by interval in 63±0.2 sec. This value is the same as for 1-sec 
histograms intervals distribution, but in latter case it is defined with accuracy in 0.2 sec.  

It’s  easy  to  see  from  intervals  distribution,  Fig. 1b),  that  after  5-times  enhancement  of 
resolution the distribution has single sharp peak again. So, change of time scale in this case 
doesn’t  lead  to  change  of  intervals  distribution.  This  means  that  we  must  enhance  time 
resolution again to study the local time peak. We can do this by using of 0.02-sec histograms 
(third line of Table 1). 

Intervals  distribution  for  case  of  0.002-sec  histograms  is  presented  on  the  Fig. 1c). 
Unlike  to  intervals  distributions  on  the  Fig. 1a)  and  Fig. 1b)  distribution  on  the  Fig. 1c) 
consists  of  two  distinct  peaks.  The  first  peak  corresponds  to  local  time  difference  equal 
62.98±0.002 sec,  the  second  one  to  63.16±0.002 sec.  The  difference  between  the  peaks  is 
∆t′ = 0.18±0.002 sec. 

Splitting of local-time peak on the Fig 1 c) is similar to splitting of daily period on two 
peaks with periods, which equal to solar and sidereal days [6-8]. This fact will be discussed 
below.

3.  Investigation  of  local-time  effect  for  longitudinal  distance  between 
locations of measurements from 6 km to 0.5 km. Mobile experiment. 

 
Above presented experiment  demonstrates the existence of local-time effect for longitudinal 
distance  between  locations  of  measurements  in  15 km  and  splitting  of  local-time  peak 
corresponding  to  the distance. It is natural to investigate the question: which is the minimal 
distance of local time effect existence? Next step in this direction is the experiment presented 
below.

In the experiment two measurement systems were used: stationary with location in Pushchino 
(Lat. 54°50.037′  N,  Lon. 37°37.589′  E)  and  mobile  one.  Four  series  of  measurements  were 
carried  out.  Locations  of  mobile  measurement  system  for  every  series  of  measurements  are 
given  in  second  column  of  Table 2.  Angular  longitudinal  difference  of  locations  of 
measurements,  α,  is  presented  in  third  column  of  the  table.  Local  time  difference  ∆t  and 
longitudinal difference of locations of measurements ∆l, are given in fourth and fifth columns 
of Table 2 correspondingly. Last column gives splitting value of local-time peak, ∆t′. 

Method  of  experimental  data  processing  was  the  same  as  for  experiment  presented  in 
second  section  of  the  paper.  Was  found  that  within  accuracy  of  experiment  the  local  time 
value ∆t and the local-time peak splitting value ∆t′ can be observed. 
 
 
4. Discussions. 
 
Local-time  effect  as  pointed  in  [1],  is  linked  to  rotatory  movement  of  Earth.  The  simplest 
explanation of the fact can be following. Due to the rotatory movement of the Earth after time 
∆t measurement system No. 2 appears in the same places where was system No. 1. The same 
places  cause  the  same  shape  of  fine  structure  of  histograms.  Actually  such  explanation  is 
incorrect  because of orbital motion of Earth, which noticeably exceeds rotatory movements. 
Therefore  measurement  system  No. 2  cannot  appear  in  the  same  places  where  was  system 
No. 1.  But  if  we  consider  two  directions  defined  by  center  of  Earth  and  two  points  of 
measurement  then  after  time  ∆t  measurement  system  No. 2  take  the  same  directions  in  the 
space as system No. 1 before. From this it follows that similarity of histograms shapes in some 
way  is  connected  with  the  same  space  directions.  This  supposition  also  agrees  with 
experimental results presented in [9-10]. 

Four-minute  splitting  of  daily  period  of  repetition  of  histograms  shape  on  solar  and 
stellar sub-periods [3] is the evidence of existence of two preferential directions: to the Sun 
and  to  the  coelosphere.  Really  after  time  interval  equal  1436 min  the  Earth  makes  one 
complete revolution and measurement system plane has the same direction in the space as one 
stellar  day  before.  After  four  minutes  from  this  moment  measurement  system  plane  will  be 
directed to the Sun. This is the cause of solar-day period – 1440 min.  

Let  us  suppose  that  splitting  described  in  the  present  paper  has  the  same  nature  as 
min  its 

splitting  of  daily  period.  Then  from  daily  period  splitting  T∆ ,  which  equal 
possible to obtain proportionality coefficient

Longitudinal  difference  between  places  of  measurements  presented  in  second  section  is 
∆t = 62.7 sec and we can calculate splitting of local-time peak for this value of 
(2) 
62.7 2.78 10
As it is easy to see from Fig. 1c) splitting of local-time peak is equal to 0.18±0.02 sec. This 
value  agrees  with  estimation  (2).  Values  of  splitting  of  the  local-time  peak,  which  are 
presented in last column of Table 2 also were calculated by help of formula (2). Experiment 
described in third section shows good agreement of the values with experimentally obtained.

This  result  allows  us  to  consider  sub-peaks  of  local-time  peak  as  stellar  and  solar  and 

suppose that in this case the cause of splitting is the same as for daily-period splitting.  

Speaking about preferential directions we implicitly supposed that measurement system 
is  directional  and  because  of  this  can  resolve  these  directions.  Such  supposition  is  quit 
reasonable for the case of daily period splitting but for splitting of local-time peak observed on 
the  small  distances  becomes  problematic  since  an  angle,  which  must  be  resolved  by  the 
measurement  system  is  neglible.  Most  likely  that  in  this  case  we  deal  with  space-time 
fluctuations,  which  in  some  way  are  connected  with  preferential  directions  to  the  Sun  and 
coelosphire. In other words we can speak about sharp anisotropy of near-earth space-time.  

Results obtained in the present work prove possibility of local-time effect investigation 
on small space scale up to 0.5 km. Farther decreasing of this scale is our immediate task. In 
the same time sub-peaks obtained as result of splitting of local-time peak also consist of one-
two histograms, so are structureless. This fact poses a problem of more detailed investigations 
of local-time peak structure.

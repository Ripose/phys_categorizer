Abstract

The  nonlinear  dynamics  of  dissipative  quantum  systems  in  incoherent  laser  fields  is

studied  in  the  framework  of  master  equation  with  random  telegraph  model  describing  the

laser noise and Markovian approximation for dealing with the system-bath couplings. Floquet

theory  and  time-dependent  perturbation  methods  are  used  to  facilitate  both  analytical  and

numerical solutions. We develop a theoretical formalism that provides a powerful tool for the

detailed analysis of the dissipative quantum dynamics of multilevel systems driven by intense

stochastic laser fields. It is found that the system relaxes to a steady state by the effect of laser

phase  and  frequency  noises  and  the  kinetic  of  this  relaxation  increases  with  the  addition  of

dissipative  terms,  introduced  by  the  coupling  to  the  reservoir.  The  case  of  amplitude

fluctuations shows a different behavior. Other results concerning the destruction of quantum

coherence  and  the  dynamical  localization  will  be  established  and  further  relaxation

mechanisms such spontaneous emission and ionization process will be also considered.

I- INTRODUCTION

The study of the time evolution of quantum systems, which are on the one hand driven

by an external field and in contact with a heat bath (reservoir) on the other hand, has received

a  great  deal  of  attention  in  recent  years  [1-4].  In  quantum  optics,  such  systems  are

investigated in the dressed-atom picture of resonance fluorescence [5], where a beam of atoms

interacts  with  a  coherent  laser  field  and  all  the  electromagnetic  modes  of  the  vacuum  [6].

Moreover,  it  is  by  now  recognized  that  nearly  all  types  of  laser–atom  interactions  can  be

strongly  affected  by  laser  noise.  Indeed  one  practical  reason  to  this  fact  is  the  use,  in

experiments, of high powers which are obtained in pulsed operation, and thus at the expense

of  poorly  stabilized  laser  beams.  Furthermore,  real  atoms  experience  a  fluctuating

environment of many perturbing interactions and ideal lasers exist only in theoretical models,

while  the  used  laser  sources  are  subjected  to  many  types  of  fluctuations  notably  in  phase,

amplitude  and  frequency  [7-10].  Other  kinds  of  fluctuations  due  to  collisional  effects  can

affect the atomic transition frequencies [9,11]. Therefore, we cannot establish, without taking

into account of the dissipative action of the environment and the statistical properties of the

laser light, a rigorous comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental results.

Different  approaches to the dissipative dynamics of open quantum systems in strong

external fields has been proposed and applied to the description of atoms under the influence

of thermal noise [1-4]. While for the incoherence of laser field, a series of models, all based

on

so-called  pre-Gaussian  Markovian  processes  [7-10]  has  been  used  in  order  to  describe  the

stochastic behavior of the laser field. It is important to mention a few technical features of this

model.  It  is  based  on  the  two-state  random  telegraph.  It  is  not  a  Gaussian  model  but  rather

‘‘pre-Gaussian’’ and has a Gaussian limit [8]. Our choice of the random telegraph is based on

the simplicity of this model that permits a unified treatment of different noisy laser in phase,

amplitude and frequency. Several works have reported on the action of random process on a

two–level system [7-10,12-15], particularly the evolution populations s

nn and the ionization

In  the  present  paper,  we  want  to  elucidate  the  role  of  quantum  dissipation  and  laser

noise on the atomic response. For this purpose, we derive a master equation, which provides a

general framework for the dynamics of atoms interacting with strong laser noisy and thermal

The  basic  idea  underlying  the  theoretical  formalism  of  that  paper  is  to  take  into

account  the  exact  dynamics  of  the  interaction  between  atomic  system  and  external  field  by

employing  the  Floquet  basis  for  the  reduced  system  rather  than  the  stationary  unperturbed

probability.

reservoir.

states

[1,2]. The interaction of the system (laser–atom) with the reservoir will be treated by the time-

dependent perturbation theory, this treatment leads to a generalized quantum master equation

for  the  reduced  density  matrix.  Such  statistical  fundamental  equation  firstly  introduced  in

quantum  optic  by  Burshtein  [16-18],  contains  all  information  concerning,  respectively,  the

atomic  transition  dynamics,  the  stochastic  evolution  of  laser  field  fluctuations  and  the

dissipative  mechanisms.  We  are  concerned  here  with  an  important  theme  of  contemporary

research,  namely  the  interplay  between  quantum  coherence  and  external  noise.  In  fact,  the

destruction  of  quantum  coherence  by  noise  is  central  to  many  fields  and  is  reflected  in  the

large number of papers recently published on this subject [19-23].

Since our computations are made at exact resonance, where the effects of spontaneous

emission  are  important  [24]  and  for  strong  laser  field,  where  the  probability  to  realize  an

ionization of atoms is highest. Therefore we shall here extend our theory by the inclusion of

the  relaxation  rates  corresponding  to  the  spontaneous  emission  and  the  ionization  processes

and present the corresponding numerical results.

 

The  theory  is  developed  in  section  2,  by  considering  the  case  of  strong  laser–atom

interaction in the presence of laser noise and dissipative effects, which are introduced by the

coupling  to  the  reservoir.  Within  the  framework  of  the  Floquet  representation  and  the

Markovian approximation, detailed theoretical calculations are feasible to obtain the reduced

matrix density  elements.  The  account  of  Floquet  theory  given  here  is  rather  brief,  since  the

theory has been discussed at length in the recent literature (see e. g. refs. [25-29]). Moreover,

the  influence of ionization process  on  the  response  atomic  function  is  presented.  Numerical

results  concerning  a  model  of  two–level  system  is  presented  in  section  3.  At  the  end  a

summary of our results is given.

II- THEORY

We consider in this paper an atomic system, which interacts with an external classical

laser  field.  Moreover,  the  system  (laser-atom)  is  coupled  to  a  quantified  radiation  field  in

thermal equilibrium. In the following we will consider the behavior of the atom coupled to a

reservoir with many degrees of freedom.

The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  provide  a  description  of  the  dynamics  in  terms  of  the

degrees of freedom of the atomic system alone by elimination of the reservoir variables. Since

the atoms are driven strongly by an external laser field, our master equation is based on the

atomic Floquet states rather than the unperturbed atomic states.

The  total  Hamiltonian  governing  the  dynamics  of  the  coupled  system  of  matter  and

radiation degrees of freedom takes the form

instantaneous phase of the laser (fluctuating around the mean value). In this paper, we use an

intense  laser  field  affected  by  a  temporal  stochastic  process  of  jumps.  These  fluctuation

mechanisms  are  described  by  the  pre-Gaussian  Markovian  models  [7-10].  In  particular,  we

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  general  master  equation  (54)  contains  dissipative  terms

Eq. (55) and Eq. (56) that explicitly depend on time. This is the main difference to the usual

optical Bloch equations. The physical interpretation to this fact is the strong distortion of the

atomic dipole moment, which is induced by the external laser field. Since the atom couples to

the environment via its dipole moment, the laser field also strongly influences the dissipation

process [2].

III- Results and discussion.

In this section we gather typical numerical results for the excitation and ionization of

two-level  atoms by  strong laser  fields in the  presence  of  noise  and  dissipation  mechanisms.

To illustrate the effects of dissipation and laser noise on the atomic response, we present the

evolution  of  atomic populations 

, which are obtained by numerical  integration  of  the

)t(nn

master  equation  (54).  Our  theoretical  formalism  is  valid  for  the  general  case  of  multilevel

systems  but  in  order  to  keep  the  discussion  simple;  we  will  restrict  our  application  to  the

two-level  atoms  for  which  a  detailed  study  of  the  dissipative  non-linear  dynamics  will  be

presented. A particular attention will be paid to the case of strong laser field, where the dipole
operator  is  taken  between  the  Floquet  eigenstates  {

  rather  than  between

})t(s,

unperturbed atomic states {

}n .

Having  established  the  effects  of  strong  laser  noise  on  the  atomic  response  and

explored  some  features  of  different  sources  of  noise  (phase,  amplitude  and  frequency).  We

concentrate our attention in this paper to the examination of quantum dissipation induced by

coupling to the reservoir and when the noise is added to the laser field. We choose the inverse

Rabi frequency W

 as time unit in the aim to analyze the obtained results in term of the noise

magnitude. We are interested by a large light intensity such that the Rabi frequency is set to

be equal to the atomic unit (W

 = 1 a.u.), This certainly is a very strong intensity.

     III. 1 Dissipative nonlinear quantum dynamics in the excitation of two-level systems.

We  begin  by  representing  only  the  effects  of  quantum  dissipation  on  the  atomic

response.  Figures  1(a)  and  1(b)  show  time  evolution  of  populations  of  a  two-level  atomic

system  driven  by  strong  coherent  laser  field  sufficiently  intense  to  remove  a  significant

fraction  of  the  population  from  the  atomic  ground  state.  One  might  think  that  the  only

consequence of a field this intense would be to lower the overall of the atom. The optical field

is  nearly  resonant  with  allowed  transition  between  discrete  states  of  two-level  atom.  In

absence  of  spontaneous  emission  decay  and  ionization  effects,  Figure  1(a)  represents  the

atomic response without dissipation, the atomic system oscillates between the ground state  1

and some other discrete level  2  and we have the ordinary Rabi oscillations. In Figure 1(b)

the  dissipation  effect  introduces  a  damping  of  Rabi  oscillations.  If  damping  effects  are

present, we expect that the Rabi oscillations will eventually become damped out and that the

population’s difference will approach some steady-state value for large scale of time. Hence,

Rabi oscillations are not present in the steady state.

It’s interesting to note the presence of an irregular behavior on the oscillations of the

two populations for a strong laser field; in fact we observe small oscillations which come to

superpose to the Rabi oscillations, their amplitude is weak  and disappears when the electric

field strength F0 becomes small with respect to the atomic unit of field strength. These little

oscillations  represent  the  fast  no-rotating  variable  phases

)

)t

'nn

  in  laser-atom

interaction, which is treated in a non-perturbative way (Floquet theory).

Figure 2, shows some typical results,  in fact we take into account of both laser phase

noise  and  dissipation  influences.  Taking  a  phase  jump  a  =  0.4p

  and  three  switching  rates

(W T  =  0.1,  1  and  10).  We  display  the  time  evolution  populations  on  two  column,  in  the

–
column  (A),  only  the  effect  of  laser  noise  is  considered,  we  remark  in  this  case  that  for  a

switching rate (W T = 1), i.e., the noise frequency (1/T) is of the  same size order that the Rabi

frequency W

, a destruction of the atomic coherence is observed. The damping  rate is strong

and  the  relaxation  to  the  steady  state  is  rapid.  The  Rabi  oscillations  are  restored  when  we

consider  the  case  of  slow  fluctuations    (W T  =  10)  and  fast  fluctuations  (W T  =0.1)  and  the

damping  rate    is  weak.  The  column  (B)  represents  the  same  situation  but  by  introducing

moreover of the laser noise the dissipative terms (see Eqs (55) and (56)). A similar behavior is

remarked  as  the  column  (A),  but  with  damping  rate  more  intense.  For  a  switching  rate

(W T = 0.1), a partial destruction of the atomic coherence is induced by the dissipation effects.

The kinetic  of  populations  relaxation  is  more  rapid  that  in  the  column  (A).  We  remark  that

one  of  the  effects  of  the  quantum  dissipation  is  the  breaking  of  the  atomic  coherence

especially  for  the  case  of  (W T  =  0.1)  and  the  establishment  of  the  dynamical  localization

regime for the  case of (W T =  1).  In  Figure  3,  we  plot  the  time  evolution  of  two-level  atom

populations in two situations,    in  first  time,  by  neglecting  the  effect  of  quantum  dissipation

(column  (A))  and  considering  only  an  amplitude  telegraph  noise  and  in  second  time  we

combine  the  two  influences  of  noise  and  quantum  dissipation.  Taking  an  amplitude  jump

a = 0.1 a.u. and three different switching rates (W T = 0.1, 1 and 100). The column (A) shows

pronounced quasi-oscillations, we remark a very weak damping at (W T = 1 and W T=100) and

rapid relaxation for (W T = 0.1) with respect to the both cases of  (W T = 1 and 100). In order to

lead the system to the steady state we must use a large number of Rabi periods rather than in

the case of phase fluctuations. The column (B) shows closely similar behavior that in column

(A).  The  complicated  structure  of  these  curves  is  a  consequence  of  the  action  of  amplitude

laser noisy on the reduced system  dynamics.  In fact, one observes a separation between the

two  occupation  probabilities,  every  population 

)t(11

  and 

)t(22

  performs    independently

s
s
irregular oscillations, which converge to stationary state. In constraints to the case of phase,

the addition of dissipation in Figure 3 (column (B)) introduces a weakness of the damping.

Figure 4 illustrates the case of frequency fluctuations, this kind of noise is introduced

by collisional effects, indeed the transition frequency w 21 can also fluctuate around its fixed

value.  The  simplest  model  of  such  interruption  collisions  [9,11]  assumes  that  the  atomic

transition  frequency  w 21  should  be  replaced  by  w 21  (t)  =  w 21  +  x(t).  By  taking  a  jump

parameter

a = 0.1 a.u. and three different frequency switching rates (W T = 1, 10 and 100). We remark in

the  column  (A)  damped  quasiperiodic  oscillations.  The  case  of  (W T  =  10)  corresponds  to

strong  damping  without  any  convergence  to  a  steady  state.  While  the  relaxation  to  an

equilibrium state of value 1/2 is clear for a switching rate  (W T = 1). The damping becomes

weak for (W T = 100) and two independent beats phenomena are observed. The complicated

time  evolution  of  populations  is  a  result  of  Rabi  oscillation  interference.  In  the  column  (B)

where we take into account of quantum dissipation, the two populations relax to equilibrium

state. The thermal noise induced by coupling to the bath introduces a complete destruction of

the atomic coherence. The kinetic of relaxation and rate damping decrease from the  case of

fast fluctuations (W T = 0.1)  to the slow fluctuations (W T = 100).

In Figures 2 and 4, the comparison between the two columns (A) and (B) shows that

the  dissipation which behaves as  a noise (thermal noise) leads the system to an  equilibrium

state with rapid kinetic of relaxation. The damping rates become large when we introduce the

dissipation  terms  (column  B).  In  other  hand,  we  clearly  see  the  destruction  of  atomic

coherence,  which  increases,  when  we  take  into  account  of  dissipation  .  The  dynamical

localization  regime  appears  for  phase  and  frequency  noises.  However  Figure  3  shows

important  asymmetries.  This  behavior  is  justified  by  the  fact  that  in  the  case  of  amplitude

fluctuations,  the  jump  parameter  a,  assigned  to  stochastic  process,  appear  in  term  of  laser

  a  ),  while  in  the  case  of  phase  noisy  ,  the  dependence  occurs  in  term  of

intensity  F0  (1  –

    III. 2  Dissipative nonlinear quantum dynamics in the ionization of two-level systems.

Having  established a formal  framework  for the  excitation of atoms by  laser  noisy  in

presence of the reservoir action and explored some of its general predictions. We turn now to

the  examination  of  ionization  effects  on  the  populations  and  the  illustration  of  the

modifications  generated  by  the  different  kinds  of  noise  and  quantum  dissipation  on  the

ionization  rates.  In  order  to  analyze  the  ionization  effects  we  adopt  the  extended  two-level

system model proposed by Yeh and Eberly [14,32]. The computation of ionization probability

is  made  by  the  incorporation  of  responsible  term  of  ionization  [

,  with

 and 

ncR  is the relaxation rate from the excited state

|næ   to  the  continuum  |cæ ]  in  the  motion  equation  (54).  The  trace  of  s over  a  complete  set

atomic states leads to the expression 

-=
1)t(P

ion

 for the total ionization probability of

nn

2

=
1n

the system [4,13,33].

We begin by showing successively the effects of laser noise and reservoir dissipation

on the ionization probability. As illustrated in Figure 5, we have plotted total ionization as a

function  of  Rabi  periods.  Taking  an  intense  electric  laser  field  such  as  (W

  =  1  a.u.)  and  a

resonant laser frequency. The four curves of Figure 5 correspond respectively to the situations

where:  noise  and  dissipation  are  neglected,  only  the  noise  is  considered,  only  dissipation

effect  is  retained  and  both  noise  and  dissipation  exist.  In  Figure  5(a)  we  have  considered  a

s
t
-
d
-

t
(cid:229)
s
phase noise of a = 0.4p

, the results depend on the fluctuations time scale (1/T) compared to

the other characteristic time scales of the problem such the Rabi frequency W

. The minimum

variations  of  the  ionization  probability  are  obtained,  where  we  neglect  both  noise  and

dissipation.  When  we  take  into  account  of  dissipation,  the  ionization  probability  increases.

For  large  number  of  Rabi  period,  we  remark  that  the  phase  fluctuations  effect  is  more

important that the reservoir action, in fact, the ionization probability  rapidly increases when

we  introduce  phase  fluctuations  corresponding  to  the  case  of  (W T  =  0.1).  In  presence  of

dissipation terms, the ionization probability variations remain closely constant. We conclude

that noise and dissipation rapidly leads the atom to the ionization states. Figure 5(b) shows the

case of amplitude noise, where the jump parameter is taken a = 0.1 a.u. and a switching rate

(W T = 1). A close behavior is observed as Figure 5(a) but the amplitude noise effect is very

weak. The technique that we have used will be applied subsequently to frequency noise.

A  plot  that  gives  a  pictorial  sense  of  how  ionization  proceeds  in  time  is  given  in

Figure 6. The total probability of ionization Pion(t) as a function of the Rabi period is plotted

together  with  the  occupation  probabilities  of  bound  states.  The  oscillations  in  these  curves

reflect  the  Rabi  oscillations  of  the  atom  between  the  resonantly  coupled  states  1   and  2 .

These oscillations are damped by ionization in a few W

t’s. This behavior is well known from

the study of bound states coupled by an intense field. The column (A) of Figure 6 shows the

response of two–level in presence of phase noise and (B column) by considering moreover the

effect of dissipation. The same parameters are taken as Figure 2. The populations, which have

not been lost through direct ionization to the atomic continuum, oscillate in the same manner

that in absence of ionization effect, but there is a progressive decay to a zero probability.  The

ionization probability can be viewed as dominant in a few Rabi periods and increases rapidly

in  time  when  the  quantum  dissipative  effects  are  considered.  Figure  7  displays  the  same

behavior that Figure 6 but for an amplitude noise.

CONCLUSION

In  this  paper  we  have  investigated  at  length  the  non-linear  dynamics  of  dissipative

quantum atomic systems subjected to the action of heat bath and periodically driven by strong

laser field which is affected by classical noise. We have derived and solved a master equation

for  atoms  in  strong  noisy  laser  fields  and  in  presence  of  reservoir  dissipative  effects.  Such

equation  based  on  the  Floquet  states  rather  than  the  unperturbed  atomic  states  has  given

typical and interesting results concerning the atomic dynamics. In fact, we have demonstrated

how  the  master  equation  formalism,  the  Floquet  theory,  the  pre-Gaussian  models  of  laser

noise  and  the  Markovian  coupling  of  quantum  system  to  an  environment  can  be  combined

together in order to tackle a general theoretical formalism and a powerful tool for the detailed

analysis of the interaction of an atomic system with intense incoherent laser field and with a

large reservoir.

We have shown that the dissipation terms, which are time dependent respect to those

in  the  Bloch  equations,  force  the  system  to  settle  to  some  ‘‘  preferred  states  ’’  it  is  the

dynamical  localization  regime  observed  in  the  cases  of  phase  and  frequency  noises,  as  we

have  explored  in  this  paper.  Moreover  under  the  action  of  these  decay  mechanisms,  the

atomic system exhibits different regimes such as the destruction of coherence, the relaxation

to equilibrium state. In general, the strength of damping and the kinetic of relaxation increase

with the addition of dissipation effects but the case of amplitude fluctuations show a different

behavior. We have also analyzed the modifications induced by ionization effects.

ABSTRACT:  A  method  of  slicing  of  high-energy  electron  beams  following  their  interaction  with  the  transverse 

component of the wakefield left in a plasma behind a high intensity ultra short laser pulse is proposed. The transverse 

component of the wakefield focuses a portion of the electron bunch, which experiences betatron oscillations. The length 

of the focused part of the electron bunch can be made substantially less than the wakefield wavelength.

Introduction 

An  important  scientific  problem  in  future  accelerators  is  the  generation  of  extremely  short 

relativistic  electron  bunches.  Electron  bunches  of  a  femtosecond  duration  can  be  employed  for  a 

myriad  of  applications,  including  the  femtosecond  x-ray  pulse  generation,  in  particular,  for  the 

purposes  to  investigate  the  matter  dynamics  in  the  interatomic  time  scale  and  the  rapid  biological 

dynamics.  

The  utilization  of  intense  laser  to  accelerate  electrons  in  a  compact  fashion  through  laser 

wakefield is well known [1]. Here we introduce a method to efficaciously utilize the wakefield for 

the  purpose  of  focusing  the  accelerated  beam.  As  well  known,  the  laser  radiation  produces  the 

ponderomotive  force  that  acts  on  charged  particles  and  allows  the  controlled  manipulation  of 

electrons. The ponderomotive acceleration of electrons by strong electromagnetic force in vacuum

has  been  proposed  in  Ref.  [2]  and  it  has  been  discussed  actively  since  then  [3-6].  The 

ponderomotive  force  is  capable  of  trapping  charged  particles,  as  it  has  been  observed  in  the 

experiment  presented  in  Ref.  [7].  A  combination  of  the  ponderomotive  electron  trapping  in  the 

transverse direction and their acceleration in the longitudinal direction has been discussed in Refs. 

[5,6],  where  the  relativistic  electron  bunch  slicing  by  the  ponderomotive  force  in  both  the 

longitudinal  and  transverse  directions  has  been  described  in  detail.  We  notice  here  the  relativistic 

electron  bunching  produced  as  a  result  of  its  interaction  with  the  laser  pulse  during  the  electron 

propagation  inside  the  wakefield  wiggler.  An  ultrashort  laser  pulse  in  this  case  modulates  the 

electron energy and then energy modulated electrons are spatially separated by the magnetic field. 

This  technique  has  been  used  in  Ref.  [8]  in  order  to  generate  femtosecond  x-ray  pulses.  The 

relativistic electron bunching may also occur as a result of the radiation instability development as it 

has been shown in Ref. [9]. 

Due  to  the  very  high  electric  field  it  can  sustain,  plasma  may  be  used  as  a  medium  for  the 

relativistic  electron beam  slicing  [10]  in the  longitudinal direction.  The  plasma  lens has  also been 

proposed  as  a  final  focusing  element  to  improve  the  luminosity  of  future  high  energy  electron-

positron colliders [11]. When the laser pulse propagates in an underdense plasma, its ponderomotive 

pressure  forms  regions  with  strong electric  charge  separation,  which propagates with the  speed  of 

the laser pulse. Charged particle acceleration by these wake plasma waves left in a plasma behind a 

high  intensity  ultra  short  laser  pulse  has  been  attracting  a  great  attention  for  a  long  time  because 

wake  waves  can  have  electric  field  that  is  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  those  found  in 

conventional  accelerators  [1].  The  longitudinal  component  of  the  electric  field  contributes  to  the 

acceleration  of  charged  particles  and  the  transverse  component  affects  the  particle  motion  in  the 

direction perpendicular to the laser pulse propagation (see Figs. 2 and 6 in Ref. [12]).  

In order to examine the detailed structure of the electric field inside the first period of the wake 

wave,  we  carried  out  2D  PIC  simulations  with  the  code  REMP  based  on  the  “density 

 

2

decomposition” scheme [13]. In the simulations, the laser pulse linearly polarizes along the z axis; it 

propagates along the x axis. Its dimensionless amplitude is a = 5, corresponding to the peak intensity 

I = 5.36ä1018 (0.8 µm/λ)2 W/cm2. Here, x and y are normalized to the laser pulse wavelength λ = 

2πc/ω;  the  time  unite  is  equal  to  the  laser  radiation  period,  T  =  2π/ω;  and  the  plasma  density  is 

normalized to the critical density, ncr =  meω2/4πe2. The  laser pulse has a size  of 10ä60. The laser 

pulse interacts with a 225ä150 plasma slab with the density n =1ä10-4 ncr. In Fig. 1, we present the 

results  of  simulations.  Here,  we  show  the  electron  density  distribution  (a),  the  x  (b)  and  y  (c) 

components of the electric field, in the (x, y) plane for t = 200. We see that the x and y components 

of the electric field in the vicinity of the laser pulse axis are linear functions of the coordinates x and 

y, respectively.

Within a substantially long portion of the wakefield the transverse electric field focuses electrons 

toward the axis. As a result, an unmatched beam oscillates with the betatron frequency, periodically 

focusing and defocusing. In Ref. [14] observed were radial jets of low energy electrons, which were 

likely caused by the transverse ejection of electrons due to the radial structure of the wakefield and 

space charge deflection of electrons, as they exit the laser focus. Multiple betatron oscillations of the 

ultra-relativistic electron beam caused by the transverse component of the beam excited wake field 

have been studied experimentally in Ref. [15]. The length of the focused part of the electron beam is 

approximately equal to the wavelength of the wake wave. If the plasma slab length is chosen to be 

slightly less than the betatron oscillation length, the electron bunch is focused in a vacuum region at 

the  rear  side  of  the  slab.  By  using  a  narrow  collimator,  we  can  extract  a  focused  portion  of  the 

electron  beam.  This  opens  a  way  for  slicing  ultrarelativistic  electron  beams  into  sub-picosecond 

beamlets.  

The proposed scheme is illustrated in Fig. 2. In this simplified picture the electron beam slicer 

consists of a finite length underdense plasma slab and a narrow collimator.  At the first stage shown 

in Fig. 2 a, a relativistically intense laser pulse generates the wake wave. Inside the wake wave there 

is  a  transverse  electric  field  which  focuses  the  co-propagating  electron  beam.  Then,  at  the  second 

stage  explained  in  Fig.  2  b,  the  electron  beam  leaves  the  plasma  slab  with  the  negative  radial 

velocity and continues to focus. At the position of the focus we put the collimator with the pin-hole 

diameter of the order of the focused beam waist. After the beam has passed through the collimator it 

appears at the rear side in the form of a beamlet with the length less than the wake wave wavelength 

(see Fig. 2 c).

3. Discussion and Conclusions 

We here presented an approach for slicing of high-energy electron beams due to focusing of the 

electron by the transverse component of the wakefield generated in a plasma slab by a high intensity 

laser. Then, the electron beam leaves the plasma slab with the negative radial velocity and continues 

to focus. At the position of the focus the collimator with the pin-hole diameter of the order of the 

focused beam waist, after the beam has passed through the collimator it appears at the rear side in 

the form of a beamlet with the length less than the wake wave wavelength. We note that the present 

method is efficient because the focusing transverse field propagates with the electron beam, thereby 

 

9

elongating the interaction time by a factor of 

γ . The current method may constitute of novel ways 

ph

in what we call relativistic engineering. The intensity of the wakefield focusing field amounts to 100 

GeV/m, allowing the effectiveness in extreme high energy applications as well as efficient compact 

focusing.  

As compared to vacuum focusing method [5], where focusing force arises due to the transverse 

component  of  the  ponderomotive  force  or/and  the  laser  transverse  fields  in  a  capillary  tube,  this 

focal force is subject to the breakdown of the surface material of the capillary and surely much less 

than GeV/m, order of magnitude smaller than what we consider here.  

We  also  note  an  analogy  between  the  present  method  for  the  electron  beam  slicing  and  the 

approach for manipulating the laser accelerated ion beam quality by using the electrostatic focusing 

system. Within the framework of the ion focusing technique [18] a thin hollow cylindrical shell is 

irradiated  by  a  femtosecond  high-power  laser  pulse  when  the  ion  bunch  flies  through  it.  In  their 

method the heated plasma in the cylinder ablates inwards. Due to the electric charge separation at 

the  plasma  front  the  radial  electric  field  is  generated,  which  affects  on  the  transverse  ion  motion 

similar to the effect produced by the transverse component of the wake field on fast electrons. As 

experimentally demonstrated in [18], this technique allows one to simultaneously focus the proton 

beam and to cut it onto quasi-monoenergetic beamlets.  

Extremely short bunches thus created through the presented method may be beneficial to many 

applications, including femtosecond and attosecond X-ray generations, fast time-resolved radiolysis, 

and high energy accelerators.

When  two  of  three  pairs  of  the  Gaussian  laser  beams  of  a  traditional  MOT  are  misaligned  in  the  “racetrack” 
configuration the effective coordinate-dependent vortex force do arise. Then an atom is accelerated by this vortex force 
until its velocity not balanced by the damping force. This situation may produce a stable ring of revolving atoms of a 
certain radius. Due to the different frequency and laser beams intensity dependences of the vortex, damping and trapping 
forces it is possible to equalize the radii of two orbiting groups of atoms in two-species or dual-isotope magneto-optical 
trap and so to arrange a continuing collider of cooled atoms with the prescribed relative velocity. A collider setup for 
atoms of two different types rotating with different angular velocities along the same ring-like trajectory into MOT of the 

conventional six-beam geometry is proposed and designed on example of two rubidium isotopes

1.  Introduction 

 
Laser cooling and trapping of atoms in MOT is a powerful method to produce a large number of atoms at very low 
temperature  and  investigate  their  interactions.  During  development  of  such  techniques,  it  became  evident  that  atomic 
collisions  were  one  of  the  main  limiting  factors  in  achievement  of  high  density  samples  on  the  road  to  Bose-Einstein 
condensation since the loss mechanisms were caused by laser-induced collisions. 

On the other hand, the laser-cooling technique could be used as a tool to study collision processes at energy range by 
more than six orders of magnitude lesser in comparison with the thermal collisions. A large fraction of atoms in MOT are 
in the excited state and so the excited-state collisions play an important role. It should be mentioned as well that their 
cross section may be many orders of magnitude larger than for ground-state collisions.   

 Long duration excited- state collisions between slow particles in presence of a light field became a fruitful subject 
from  which  high-resolution  information  on  molecular  structure  could  be  obtained.  For  typical  temperatures  in  optical 
traps, the velocities of the atoms are sufficiently low so that a spontaneous decay may take place before or in the process 
of collision. Therefore, the collision dynamics is very sensitive to tuning of the laser frequency. Last years achievements 
in  construction  of  the  duel-isotopes  [1-3]  (DIMOT)  and  two-species  [4-6]  (TSMOT)  magneto-optical  traps  open  new 
possibilities  for  cold  and  ultra-cold  collisions  studies  and  photo-associative  spectroscopy.  Here  I  propose  use  specific 
spatial ( rotating ring-like) modes of different atoms or isotopes for design of a circular atomic collider for cold atoms 
with the calculated velocity and a given level of excitation. 

2.  Calculation of the orbits in conventional misaligned MOT 

 

Ring-like spatial distributions (modes) of atoms orbiting around a core were firstly observed in a misaligned 
cesium MOT [7] and explained in terms of the conventional MOT forces acting on each individual atom plus the 
assumption about influence of the collective interatomic forces  acting between  the trapped atoms [7,8]. After 
observation in sodium MOT the variety of spatial structures of cooled atoms (including coreless rings),[9], a simple 
model of coordinate-dependent vortex forces was developed which allowed to explain all observed cooled atoms 
structures and the transitions between them in terms of forces acting on each individual atom [10,11].

Let us consider the misaligned in the xy plane trapping laser beam configuration as shown in Fig. 1(a) with the 

perfectly aligned beams in the z direction. We assume all beams as ideal Gaussian functions, so that the Rabi

(adopted from Ref. [10]). 

 
Due to the misalignment, the radiative force acting on the atom along the y direction has an x dependence and vice 
versa. In other words, beside the velocity and field-intensity dependent terms in the force expression an extra azimuthal 
component do appears, which is referred to as the vortex force. It is clear from consideration of the forces in xy plane.  
For a Gaussian beam propagating exactly along the x-direction, the velocity-independent part of the radiative force has 
the form [12,9]

effective potential well and the effective restoring (trapping) force have azimuthal dependence with the period 
r
This  restoring  force  is  proportional  to  the  gradient  B
  regulating  the  light  pressure.  The 
Doppler shift in the restoring force provides a velocity-dependent damping force that makes the atomic motion in MOT 
to  be  strongly  overdamping  [8,9].  The  azimuthal  dependence  of  the  damping  (friction)  force  is  identical  to  the 
dependence of the trapping force. 
Misalignment of the laser beams (Fig. 1(a)) makes the trapping potential to be slightly nonharmonic and (what is much 
more important) introduces the vortex force.

The nonmonotonic dependence of  the −ϕ function on detuning means that due to the different dependences of the 
trapping (damping) forces and the vortex force on the detuning there is a certain frequency interval where to each value 
of the ring radius corresponds two values of the negative detuning (“frequency bistability”). The right branch of this 
curve-increasing of the ring radius on the detuning – was steadily established in Refs. [9-11]. For not so strong fields the

It means that to ensure rather noticeable dependence of ring radius one should maintain quite large value of the 
parameter  B in Eq. (7), which depends on the gradient of the magnetic field and the misalignment parameter s . In the 
conditions of the experiments  [9-11] the value of this unitless  parameter was of the order of  
noticeable variation of ring radius under detuning. . 
Now we apply these results to consideration of ring structures in dual-isotope and two-species magneto-optical traps.

are different by 1126 MHz. The master laser is 
85Rb . One slave laser is locked to the master laser without frequency shift, whereas the second 
tuned to the cooling frequency of 
slave laser is shifted by -1126 MHz by the electro-optical modulator. A beam splitter combines the light of two slave lasers to a two-
frequency beam that cool both isotopes simultaneously. There are yet two free-running repumping lasers not shown at the setup (Fig. 
from Ref. [1]). 
 
This setup was typically operated at the beams intensity

. The achieved densities of the trapped isotopes in DIMOT were of the order of
comparable with densities in the conventional rubidium MOT. Since it was conventional MOT with the carefully aligned 
pairs of beams only flat-topped spatial core atomic structures were observed. 
It is interesting to estimate the possibility of observation of the ring spatial structures in the misaligned DIMOT with the 
similar parameters of a trap. First of all let us estimate magnitude of the function

The physical sense of the condition (11) consists in the balance of the trapping and centrifugal forces in the radial 
direction and the vortex and damping (friction) forces in the azimuthal one. 
In our oversimplified model of the isotropic harmonic trap neither of the forces depends on the angle of the rotation. In

fact, due to anisotropy of the trap there is very strong azimuthal  (on the angle ϕ) dependence of the vortex force

Fortunately, the friction force has exactly the same angular dependence. As a result, rotation of an atom occurs with 
constant angular velocity ω. This fact turned out to be important under consideration of the beam imbalance and 
crosswind elevating force effects in the optical supermolasses  setups [13,14].

Variant of the experiment with rubidium isotopes is considered here due to its relative simplicity because of possibility to 
employ for cooling only one master laser in six-beam geometry. Using two maser lasers one may cool any types of atoms 
and employ such collider setup for investigation of different atomic collisions under prescribed relative velocities. Note 
that one of the most vivid manifestation of the atomic collisions should be increase of thicknesses of two atomic rings 
with equal radii under their overlapping.

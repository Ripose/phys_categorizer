Abstract 

The  binary  model  of  physical  vacuum  is  considered.  This  model 
reveals  unified  cause-and-effect  mechanism  of  electromagnetic  and 
gravitational interactions. 

The model of binary vacuum does not identify physical vacuum to a 
substance  as  the  model  of  mechanical  ether  does,  but  presents 
physical  vacuum  as  the  unity  of  two  simultaneously  everywhere 
existed  non-structural  electrical  elementary  media  symbolically 
designated  EM+  and  EM-.  They  are  just  the  same  except  for  their

Lorentz forces; why are the electromagnetic waves transversal.

1. Introduction 

The fundamental physical theories of the twentieth century have improved the life 
of  the  mankind  radically,  having  opened  before  it  practical  ways  of  fast  technological 
progress. 

However  any  physical  theory  yet  has  not  answered  profound  questions  of 

knowledge of a nature: 

1.   What's the internal structure of electric charges? 
2.   What’s  the  internal  arrangement  of  electric  and  magnetic  fields  near  these 

charges? 

zero? 

3.   What’s the nature of an energy of these fields? And why is it always more then 

4.   How does the interaction of electric charges and fields result in the occurrence 
of  Coulomb  and  Lorentz  forces?  What’s  the  cause-and-effect  mechanism  of 
these forces? 

5.   What’s the internal arrangement of the gravitational fields? 
6.   What’s 

the  density  of  a  gravitational-field  energy?  And  what’s 

the 
cause-and-effect foundation for the localization of this energy near a solid body? 
Why should it always be less then zero? 

7.   How does the Newton gravitation force arise between solids? 
The model of binary physical vacuum takes up all these questions and allows to 

answer them exchausively, opening new horizons of knowledge. 

The  binary  model  of  physical  vacuum  obliges  all  bodies  to  interact  so  as  it  is 
observed  in  a  nature.  It  reveals  the  uniform  mechanism  of  electromagnetic  and 
gravitational interactions. 

2. Definition. 

2.1. It is used as the basic the following units of measurement: 
 m, C, J, s. 
2.2.  The  Medium  is  called  a  part  of  a  space  except  for  its  boundaries,  admitting 

local accumulation and movement of the energy in themselves. 

2.3. Bodies are called the limited-in-space formations containing an energy. 
2.4. The Vacuum is called the medium which does not contain any bodies. 
2.5.  The  Interaction  is  called  a  cause-and-effect  process  and  a  state  of  the 

deformations interchanging between bodies and media. 

2.6. This process connects with the energy movement and cannot be instantaneous. 

Therefore causes and effects can be observed separately, and it is the course of time: 

Т interaction = Т effect - Т cause > 0 - for any observer.

3. The binary model of vacuum. 

3.1. The  vacuum consists of the two eternal, simultaneously existing, unstructured 
elementary  media  (EM)  conditionally  named  «EM+»  and  «EM−».  They  do  not  differ 
anything else except for their name (sign). Absolute values of their undisturbed density are 
equal to: 

=+

(3.1) 

 
3.2.  They  penetrate  each  other  diffusively  and  uniformly.  Each  of  them  has  the 

solidity and the elasticity in relation to an individual dilatation and mutual shearing. 

3.3.  It  is  impossible  for  the  observer  to  distinguish  one  point  from  another  in  the 

strainless vacuum − he cannot individualize them. 

So the elementary volumes do not interact, there is no also course of time. Therefore 
it  is  impossible  to  determine  any  system  of  coordinates  and  any  course  of  time  in  the 
undisturbed vacuum. Hence, it is no meaning the concept of a velocity (as an individual 
derivative  of  elementary-volume  coordinates  with  respect  a  time)  for  the  undisturbed 
vacuum. Thus the binary vacuum is not an "ether". Each point (an elementary volume) of 
the strained vacuum is individualized, at least, the own deformation tensor. Hence, there 
are an equivalent geometry, kinematics and dynamics (all mutually relativistic) for every 
area of the strained vacuum. 

3.4. As the measure of the relative (diffusive) shearing of elementary media we shall

4. Bodies. 

4.1.  An  electro-charged  body  is  a  body,  which  has  retracted  some  superfluous 
volume of the single elementary medium in itself from own neighbourhood by means of 
this medium shearing. As it is shown in fig. 4.1, this volume is equal to:

In  static  problems  as  a  neutral  body  we  may  consider  any  configuration  of 
motionless or moving charges if an instantaneuos relative shearing λ (in the volume of an 
observer N) is less than the resolving power of the observer. 

 
5. The electric field. 
 
5.1. The electric field in the vacuum outside of a body is described completely by 

the vector relative diffusive shearing strain of the displacement (fig. 4.1).

5.2. Owing to a small extensibility of elementary media, this field is propagated in a 

vacuum unlimitedly with the conservation of the displacement volume. This implies, that

It  appears  that  the  experimental  fact  of  the  superposition  of  electric  fields  is  a 

necessary consequence of the proposed model.

signs follows equally.

and the charge q2 − with speed U2, then (as a result of relativistic properties of space−time 
and  energy−impulse,  and  also  according  to  items  5.1,  6.1.2,  6.3)  the  more  complicated 
fields and their interactions are established in the neighbourhood of N.

it is necessary, that each of the elementary media on one’s own and independently

disturbed forces disappear. 

However,  thus  elasticity  to  absolute  contraction  is  the  alien  property  for  the 
elementary  media  (according  to  item  3.2.).  And  in  order  that  locally  expanded  and 
contracted EM elements were restored elastically, it is necessary, that the initial (“zero”)

 from the

7.3.  During  the  forming  of  the  neutral  body  spherical  surface  R2  divides  all  the 
space into two subspaces SSin with R < R2 and SSout with R > R2. The transformation of 
the  external-force  work  into  the  energy  of  the  shearing-strain  field  inside  the  surface  R2 
takes place just on the surface R2. During this process the external subspace (as a source of 
external forces) loses this energy. 

7.4.  Such  process  of  the  energy  redistribution  is  realized  by  three  different  local 

deformations of the binary vacuum:

The Binary Model of Physical Vacuum 

8.4.  The  mechanism  of  the  possible  radiation  of  gravitational  waves  (both 
longitudinal – according to 8.1, and transversal – according to 8.2) has not been clear yet. 
Any observation of these waves in a nature has not been presented yet. 

8.5.  The  mechanism  of  the  radiation  of  transversal  electromagnetic  waves 

(described in 8.3) is well known. 

 
9. The distribution of gravitational-energy density  
 
It  is  experimentally  established,  that  the  vacuum  has  the  complex  structure 
admitting in the polarization, the creation, the annihilation and mutual transformations of 
various microparticles and fields, and also grandiose cosmogonic processes. 

The  binary  vacuum  model,  revealing  the  general  constructure  of  electromagnetic 
and  gravitational  fields,  defines  also  the  density  of  the  gravitational-field  energy  (as  the 
energy of the binary-vacuum deformation) in the following form (according to 7.7.2): 

 

where  R  is  the  distance  from  the  mass  center  M  and  G  =  6,67·10-11  m5·J-1·s-4  −  the 
gravitation constant.

It  is  equal  to  the  potential  energy  of  Newton  gravitation  forces  in  accuracy,  that 

verified by all experience and observations of humanity (see, for example, [2], page 192). 

It  convinces  us  that  the  equation  (7.7.2.)  inferred  by  the  author  speculatively  is 
corrected objectively, and in the same time it allows to give the phenomenological Newton 
gravitation law the profound energetic essence.  

 

10. Conclusions 

the  quantum  model  of  four  fundamental 

 
This work deals with the unsolved problem of natural sciences of 19-20 centuries - 
the mechanism of the physical interaction of bodies at the distance (through the vacuum). 
Not pretending on its common decision, the author develops the consistent general model 
of electromagnetic and gravitational interactions, that allows to present these interactions 
evidently. 
Now 

interactions  (strong,  weak, 
electromagnetic  and  gravitational),  as  result  of  discrete  (pair)  exchanges  of  interaction 
quantums  (including  photons  and  gravitons)  between  bodies  of  a  microcosm  is  widely 
used in physics. To be universal for a macrocosm, this model requires that each microbody 
interacted personally with all other bodies, i.e. emitted interaction quantums continuously 
and isotropically. For example, to describe electromagnetic and gravitational interactions 
between three electrons (positrons) only, wandering far from each other among galaxies, it 
is necessary to assume, that during billion years each of them was emitting the isotropical 
and continuous radiation of photons and gravitons, that is not proved energetically.  

Now  the  classical  (not  quantum)  representation  of  the  gravitation  physics  is  the 
general theory of the relativity (GTR), based on the Riemann geometrization of a space-
time  continuum  in  a  gravitation  field.  It  explains  many  experimental  and  observant 
phenomena of the bodies’ kinematics and radiations and has predictive force. But GTR is 
powerless to explain the basic experimental fact of the gravitation - the negative density of 
the gravitational-field energy.

The Binary Model of Physical Vacuum 

Now the classical (not quantum) model for an electromagnetic field is not present in 
general. It (the field) is defined in the electrodynamics as " the special form of a matter ". 
Such definition is not, certainly, the physical model of a field, and reflects, most soon, the 
general physicists’s belief in the future omnipotence of the human genius. 

After Einstein had created in 1915 his theory of the relativity tens GTR modifications 
were  worked  out.  But  all  their  authors  emphasized  themselves,  that  any  this  theory  does 
not define the internal structure of the gravitational field or its energy because all they are 
not  dynamical,  but  are  kinematical,  i.e.  proceed  from  the  equivalence  principle:  the 
noninertial  system  of  coordinates  is  equivalent  to  the  gravitational  field,  which 
unequivocally  determined  by  the  metrical  tensor  gik  so  that  in  the  noninertial 
(gravitational) frame of reference the square of an interval would satisfy the parity ds2 = 
gik·dxi·dxk .  

Thus all GTR modifications proceed from the idea that any gravitational field is non 

others then the variation of the space-time metrics and its operations. 

The  binary  vacuum  model  does  not  require  the  definition  of  the  kinematical  (four-
dimensional)  gik  metrics,  because  it  is  relativistically  dynamical  (as  electrodynamics!), 
instead  of  kinematical  (does  not  proceed  from  the  kinematical  equivalence  principle),  as 
GTR.  

There  is  not  any  borrowings  from  today's  interactions  models  in  the  our  work. 

Definitions of fundamental physical conceptions are taken from a nature only (chapter 2). 

The  binary  vacuum  model  is  relativistic  (chapter  3).  It  consistently  constitutes 
models  of  the  neutral  and  charged  bodies  (chapter  4),  electromagnetic  and  gravitational 
fields (chapters 5, 7), the relativistic electrodynamics and gravidynamics (chapters 6, 7). 

Here it is revealed the essence of world constants E0 and G and the cause-and-effect 
essence of Coulomb, Lorentz and Newton forces, and also wave processes in the vacuum 
(chapters 5-8).  

All  this  may  be  the  contribution  into  the  theory  of  great  unification  of  interactions, 
because the macroscopical gravitational constant is related to (by function 7.7.1) the radius 
of the elementary particles prevailing in a nature.  

The binary vacuum model is not yet a physical theory, but only the sketch. But it has 
resulted in that already, that was inaccessible to all GTR modifications: the discovery of 
two  new  physical  concepts:  the  physical  structure  and  the  energy  of  the  gravitational 
field (a parities 7.7.2 and 9.4).

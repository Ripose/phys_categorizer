Abstract : The importance and the advantages of the covariant projection finite elements 

are highlighted . The covariant projection finite element is applied for two different cross 

sections  of  a  rectangular  wave  guide.  Its  results  are  compared  with  the  nodal  cartesian 

component  formulation  validating  the  practical  efficiency  of  the  covariant  projection 

formulation over the nodal cartesian formulation. 

 
Key words : Covariant projection , cartesian formulation, spurious modes 
 
Introduction  :  The  finite  element    method  has  proved  to  be  a  versatile  tool  for  the 

analysis  of  the  electromagnetic  field  problems.  In  particular,  the  vector  finite  element 

method  has  been  successful  in  dealing  with  problems  concerning  the  computation  of 

electromagnetic  fields  subject  to  the  boundary  conditions  occurring  by  virtue  of  the 

physical shape of the geometry under consideration. However the finite element method 

had been troubled by the occurrence of the spurious modes in the solution of the resulting 

eigen  value  equation.  The  spurious  modes  are  those  non  physical  modes  which  are 

characterized by the non zero divergence of the magnetic field associated with that mode. 

Hence  adequate  care  is  necessary  in  the  finite  element  analysis  for  modeling  the  zero 

divergence of the magnetic field to prevent the occurrence of spurious modes. Among the 

various approaches suggested for the prevention of spurious modes,  one of the approach 

is to use the mixed order covariant projection elements in the series expansion of the  

unknown field and to enforce only the tangential continuity between the elements [1]. The

covariant projections was initially introduced by Crowley, Silvester and Hurwitz for 3D 

vector  field  problems.  With  these  elements,  vector  finite  element  methods  can  be 

implemented  as  directly  as  scalar  finite  element  methods  :  boundary  and  interface 

conditions  are  easily  imposed  and  spurious  modes  are  removed  without  resorting  to 

global penalty terms or constraints [2]. 

 
Theory :  The covariant projections  of a vector field E are simply its components in a 

curvilinear coordinate system [2] . In terms of the components , the projections are  

represented as ,

Any  point  can  be  represented  by  nodal  cartesian  coordinates  as  (x,y,z).  To  introduce 

covariant projections, a new coordinate system with variables (ξ,η,ν) can be constructed 

so that only one variable changes along the side of the element. Unitary vectors

It is shown in [1] that in all the covariant projection expansions, the condition m<n and 

neither  m  nor  n  equal  to  zero  and  only  the  tangential  continuity should be  imposed for 

avoiding  the  spurious  solutions.  The  limits  of  (ξ,η,υ)  in  all  the  covariant  projection  is 

from –1 to 1.

boundary  segments  and  ‘ib’  refers  to  inter-element  boundary  contours  and  ‘*  ‘denotes 

complex  conjugate  of  the  field.  The  expression  in  (8a)  indicates  summation  over 

elemental  ,inter-element  and  outer    boundary  segment  contributions.  The  expression  in 

(8c) vanishes when the outer boundary of the waveguide is a good conductor , since the 

first term in the integrand  vanishes on the surface of a good conductor. The integration 

over  inter  element  boundary  segments  will  also  vanish  as  these  integrals  will  appear 

twice but with opposite directions of integration and having the same integrand.

The E field variation with υ is assumed to have the form exp(-jβυ) and υ component of E 

is 90 degree out of phase as compared to the other components. 

Substituting  the  matrix  representations  in  the  functional  applying  the  condition  of  the 

vanishing  of  the  variation  of  the  functional  with  respect  to  the  nodal  electric  field 

components, and assembling together after obtaining individual S and T matrices for each

following cross-sections : 

a)  Cross sectional sides parallel to the X and Y axes. 

b)  Cross sectional sides inclined to the X and Y axes. 

 
The  computer  program  written  in  TURBO  BASIC  for  nodal  cartesian  formulation  and 

covariant formulation for rectangular cross-section having its sides parallel and inclined 

to  the  cartesian  axes  were  developed  and  the  results  are  tabulated.  The  corresponding 

figures representing the two cases are given in Fig.(1) and Fig.(2) respectively. 

 

 
The  dimensions  are  taken  as    a=2.4  cm  and  b=1.2  cm.  The  cross-sectional  geometry  is 

divided into 72 rectangular elements having 4 nodes with each element. The total number 

of  nodes  are  91  and  total  number  of  field  components  are  273,  being  3  components  at 

each node. The program in TURBO BASIC was used to find the cut – off frequencies of 

different modes . The program was run for both orientations of wave guide cross-sections 

(ie rotated with 30 degree angle and without rotation). The results are given below in the 

form of a table.

Results  and  Discussion  :  The  above  table  shows  that  the  cut  off  wave  numbers  of 

different  modes  obtained  with  covariant  elements  do  not  change  due  to  rotation  of  the 

wave  guide  in  cross-sectional  plane.  This  is  what  is  expected  physically.  Further,  the 

absence of boundary conditions with two unknowns, less time is required for processing 

and  elimination  of  spurious  solutions  are  observed  to  be  the  advantages  of  covariant 

elements for the considered wave guides. 

Conclusion  :  The  application  of  the  covariant  projection  elements  for  wave  guide 

analysis is explained and its ease of implementation over the nodal cartesian formulation 

is validated by numerical implementation.

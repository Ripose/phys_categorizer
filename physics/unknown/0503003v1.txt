1. Introduction 

Rosser  [1]  presents  relativity  optics  at  an  introductory  level.  The  topics  involves  the 
aberration of light effect, the transformation of plane waves in vacuum, the Doppler Effect, 
the  reflection  of  light  on  a  moving  mirror  and  the  visual  appearance  of  rapidly  moving 
objects.  Relativists  have  developed  relativistic  diagrams  usefully  in  relativistic  kinematics, 
which display in true or in distorted values the space-time coordinates of the same event, as 
detected from two inertial reference frames in relative motion [2]. Constructing the diagram, 
the  Authors  use  the  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations  and  transform  a  kinematics  problem 
into a movie.  
The  purpose  of  our  paper  is  to  construct  a  relativistic  diagram  that  visualizes  the  optical 
effects mentioned above, displaying in true values the magnitudes of the physical quantities 
introduced  in  order  to  characterize  the  effects  we  study  as  detected  from  two  inertial 
reference  frames  in    relative  motion.  We  have  in  mind  position  vectors,  time  coordinates, 
wavelengths  and  periods,  incidence  and  reflection  angles,  visual  and  radar  detected 
appearances of rapidly moving objects.  
We say that observers from two inertial reference frames in relative motion detect the same 
event if both of them agree that it takes place at the same point in space at times displayed by 
two clocks of the two reference frames instantly located at that point. The synchronization of 
the two clocks took place in theirs own rest frames in accordance with a procedure proposed 
by Einstein. If in a two space dimensions approach, the space-time coordinates of the same 
event  are  in  one  of  the  involved  reference  frames 
  whereas  in  the  other  they  are

  then the Lorentz-Einstein transformations relate them.

Consider  that  in  one  of  the  involved  inertial  reference  frames  the  corresponding  observers 
perform an experiment. It is characterized by different events taking place at different points 

 

 

in  space  at  different  times.  We  say  that  observers  from  another  inertial  reference  frame 
perform  the  same  experiment  if  it  involves  the  same  events.  In  accordance  with  the 
relativistic  postulate,  the  same  experiments  performed  in  the  two  reference  frames  should 
lead to the same results, which do not allow detecting if the reference frames are in a state of 
rest or in a state of uniform motion. The space-time coordinates of the same events are related 
by the Lorentz-Einstein transformations. Such an approach avoids paradoxes.

The  simplest  way  to  construct  the  diagram  is  to  start  with  a  spherical  mirror  (circular  in  a 
two-space dimensions approach) with a point-like source located at its center. The center of 
the  mirror  coincides  with  the  origin  O’  of  its  rest  frame  K’(X’;O’;Y’)  where  we  find  the 
source  of  light  S’  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  We  characterize  an  event  by  its  space-time

  where  (x’;y’)  and  (r’;θ’)  are  the  Cartesian

θ
and  the  polar  coordinates  of  the  point  where  the  event  takes  place  and  t’  the  time  when  it 
takes place. Consider that S’ emits light signals in all directions in space (event 
). 
One of the light signals emitted along a direction, which makes an angle θ’ with the positive 
direction of the O’X’ axis (that is the way in which we define angles), generates arriving at

the  mirror’s  rest  frame  whereas  M(M1)  located  on  the  ellipse  represents  the  same  event  detected  from  the 
stationary frame. Establishing the relationship between them, we have considered the invariance of distances 
measured  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  relative  motion.  The  diagram  displays  in  true  values  the  space 
(Cartesian and polar) and the time coordinates of events related by the Lorentz-Einstein transformations, the 
corresponding components of the velocity of light signals (outgoing) and the Doppler shifted wavelengths and 
periods.  Constructing the diagram we have taken into account that the transformation equation for the length 
of the position vector and for the time coordinate have the same algebraic structure.

two  events  taking  into  account  the  invariance  of  distances  measured  perpendicular  to  the

in K and in K’ as well. 
The relativistic diagram we have just constructed displays in true values the corresponding

polar angles θ and θ’. At corresponding scales, the segment 
of the position vector r’ of event M’, its time coordinate t’, the wave length λ’ and the period

relativistic diagram ensure the fact that  OM  represents the corresponding physical quantities 
,O M  and OM  on the axes O’X’ and O’Y’ and on OX 
as measured in K. The projections of 
and  OY  respectively  could  represent  the  components  of  the  velocity  of  light  signal  or  the 
Cartesian coordinates as well. As we see, the circular mirror in K’ becomes when detected 
from K an elliptical mirror. The geometrical properties of the ellipse make that at point M 
where the incidence takes place when detected from K, the ray, which comes from the focal 
point F1, reflects itself towards the other focal point F2. The normal to the ellipse at point M is 
the bisecting line of the angle made by the incident ray with the reflected one, in accordance 
with the reflection law (Figure 3).

Figure 3. In the rest frame of the mirror the incident ray starts from the center of the mirror O’, reflects itself on 
the mirror and returns to its starting point. Detected from the stationary frame the circular mirror becomes an 
elliptic one. The ray starts from its focal point F1 and returns to the other focal point F2. The geometric 
properties of the ellipse make that at the reflection point the normal is the bisecting line of the angle made by 
the incident and the reflected rays, in accordance with the reflection law convincing us that it holds in all inertial

describe  the  Doppler  effect  in  the  case  of  incoming  rays.  We  obtain  the  corresponding 
relativistic diagram by overlapping the circle r’=R0 with the ellipse (26) as we show in Figure 
4.  The  diagram  displays  in  true  values  the  corresponding  values  of  the  physical  quantities 
involved in the studied experiment as detected from K’ and K respectively (r,x,y,θ,λ,T) and 
(r’,x’,y’,θ’,λ’,T’).

Figure 4. The relativistic space-time diagram for incoming ray. Event M’(

1M ) is associated with the fact that 
the reflected ray starts from a point on the circular mirror being received at O’ at a time t’=0. The corresponding 
event is M(M1). The diagram displays in true values the space (Cartesian and polar) and time coordinates of 
events  related  by  the  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations,  the  components  of  the  velocity  of  light  signals,  the 
Doppler  shifted  wavelengths  and  periods,  as  detected  from  the  two  involved  reference  frames  in  relative 
motion. 
 
In  the  case  of  the  outgoing  rays  as  in  the  case  of  the  incoming  ones,  we  do  not  detect 
relativistic effects along a well-defined direction. Imposing the condition r = r’ we obtain in 
the case of the outgoing rays for the angle θ0 along which we do not detect relativistic effects

The relativistic diagram we have constructed so far displays those directions as the line which 
joins  the  overlapped  origins  O  and  O’  with  the  point  where  the  circle  and  ellipse  intersect 
each other as we show in Figures 5a and 5b. 

 

 

 

  

Figure 5a. The intersection of the circle with the ellipse determines the events M0,1(R,θ0) and M0,2(R,-θ0). Along the directions 
OM0,1 and OM0,2 we do not detect relativistic effects for the outgoing rays. The mentioned directions separate the directions 
along which a red shift takes place (λ>λ’) from the directions along which a blue shift takes place (λ<λ’).

which a red shift takes place (λ>λ’) from the directions along which a blue shift takes place (λ<λ’). 

3. Reflection of light on moving mirrors 

We know that the reflection of light in the rest frame of the mirror takes place in accordance 
with the reflection law: 
.Incident and reflected rays are located in the same plane, 
..Incidence and reflection angles are equal to each other, 
The reflection of light on a mirror involves an incoming ray (incident) and an outgoing ray 
(reflected). That peculiarity suggests that we could solve the problem of reflection on moving 
mirrors, overlapping the two relativistic diagrams constructed above in a single one. 

3.1 Horizontal mirror located on the overlapped axes, point like 
source or incident plane wave 

The  plane  mirror  under  consideration  is  on  the  overlapped  axes  OX(O’X’)  at  rest  in  K’ 
(Figure  6).  We  present  an  incident  ray  (incident)’  and  the  corresponding  reflected  ray 
(reflected)’  assuming  that  the reflection  law  holds  in  that  frame.  The  rules  of  handling  the 

 

 

 

 

relativistic diagram enable us to find out the corresponding incident (incident) and reflected 
rays (reflected) as detected from the K reference frame. If α0 and (π-α0) represent the angles 
made by the reflected and the incident rays respectively with the overlapped axes as detected 
from  the  rest  frame  of  the  mirror  (K’),  then  when  detected  from  K  the  reflected  ray 
propagates in the direction 

whereas the incident ray propagates in a direction

(32) 

The  symmetry  of  the  results  (αi=π-αr)  convinces  us  that  the  reflection  law  holds  in  the  K 
reference frame as well. Taking into account the handling rules of the relativistic diagram, we 
see that it leads to the same result. 

 

Figure 6. The considered mirror is on the overlapped axes OX(O’X’) and at rest in the moving reference frame. 
The reflection law holds in the rest frame of the mirror and so the (incident’) and the (reflected’) rays make the 
same angle with the normal to the mirror. The relativistic space-time diagram tells us that when detected from 
the  stationary  frame,  the  reflection  law  works  as  well,  the  (incident)  and  (reflected)  rays  making  the  same 
angles with the normal to the mirror. 
 
The  (incident)’  ray  we  have  considered  so  far  can  be  one  of  the  rays  in  a  plane  wave  in 
oblique incidence or one of the rays emitted by a point-like source S’. In the first case, the 
incidence conditions are the same at all the points of the horizontal mirror. In the second case, 
the  incidence  conditions  are  different  at  its  different  points  but  the  reflection  law  holds  in 
both cases in all inertial reference frames in relative motion. 
We  reverse  now  the  paths  of  the  rays  we  have  considered  so  far  (Figure  7).  The  rules  of 
handling the relativistic diagram tell us that as detected from K the incident and the reflected 
rays change theirs previous paths. Even if the reflection law still works in K, the reversibility 
of the paths does not hold in the case of relativistic mirrors. 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure  7.  The  space-time  diagram  illustrates  the  relativistic  invariance  of  the  paths  of  the  incident  and  of  the 
reflected rays in the rest frame of the mirror. If in that reference we reverse the direction of the rays then in the 
stationary reference frame the corresponding rays do not overlap. We can say that the invariance of the paths 
of the incident and of the reflected rays is not a relativistic invariance. 

3.2 Vertical mirror and plane wave in oblique incidence 

We consider one of the rays of a plane wave in oblique incidence on a vertical mirror located 
on the O’Y’ axis of its rest frame K’ at point O’ at a time t=t’=0 (Figure 8). It reflects itself in 
accordance with the reflection law. Using the relativistic diagram, we find out easily the paths 
of the incident and of the reflected rays as detected from K. In accordance with the formulas, 
which describe the aberration of light effect we have for the incident ray

The results obtained so far suggest that the reflection law does not hold in the K frame. In 
order to clarify the problem we consider a part of the vertical mirror of length 2a and two rays 
of the plane wave in oblique incidence arriving at the lower (1’) and at the upper (2’) of its 
ends (Figure 9).

Using the derived values of the angles αi, αr and θ we can show that the reflection law works 
in the stationary reference frame as well. 

4. Transforming monochromatic radiation in a polychromatic 
one via the Doppler effect. 

Consider that the point-like source S’ located at the origin O’ of its rest frame K’ emits for the 
observers  of  that  frame  a  monochromatic  radiation.  The  problem  is  to  find  out  what  does 
become that radiation for the observers of K. The relativistic diagram (Figure 5a and 5b) tells 
02α  increases whereas the 
us that the wavelength of the radiation emitted inside the angle   
 decreases. We say that in the 
wavelength of the radiation emitted inside the angle 
first case the radiation is red shifted and that in the second case it is blue shifted. As we have 
seen above, the angle   defines the direction along which we do not detect relativistic effects. 
If the source S’ emits N photons uniformly in all directions, then

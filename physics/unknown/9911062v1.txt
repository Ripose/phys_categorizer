for his insight on the way photons propagate through the quantum vacuum.

ABSTRACT

Our theory of quantum gravity called Electro-Magnetic Quantum Gravity (EMQG) depends heavily on
an important property of the quantum vacuum; it’s ability to effect the velocity of photon propagation
under  two  very  special  physical  conditions.  In  the  first  case,  photon  propagation  in  the  vacuum  is
altered when the electrically charged virtual particle density changes, as it does between the Casimir
plates.  In  the  second  case,  photon  propagation  in  the  vacuum  is  also  altered  when  there  is  a
coordinated  acceleration  given  to  the  electrically  charged  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum,
such as near a large mass like the earth (EMQG). These effects can be understood through the familiar
process  that  photons  partake  when  interacting  with  all  electrically  charged  particles;  ‘Photon
Scattering’.

Here  we  propose  experiments  that  might  be  set  up  to  detect  the  increase  in  the  velocity  of  light  in  a
vacuum  in  the  laboratory  frame  for  the  first  case,  that  is  when  photons  travel  between  (and
perpendicular to) the Casimir plates in vacuum. The Casimir plates are two closely spaced, conductive
plates, where an attractive force is observed to exist between the plates called the ‘Casimir Force’. We
propose that the velocity of light in a vacuum increases when propagating between the Casimir Plates,
which are in a vacuum. We call this effect the ‘Light Velocity Casimir Effect’  or  LVC  effect.  In  the
second case where light propagates upwards or downwards on the earth, the change in light velocity
predicted  by  EMQG  is  associated  with  a  corresponding  curved  4D  space-time  in  general  relativity,
where light velocity is taken as constant. We find that it is impossible to distinguish between these two
conflicting views of light propagation in large gravitational fields by experimental means at this time.

The LVC effect happens because the vacuum energy density in between the plates is lower than that
outside the Casimir plates. The conductive plates  disallow  certain  frequencies  of  electrically  charged
virtual particles to exist inside the plates, thus lowering the inside vacuum particle density, compared to
the density outside the plates. The Casimir plates also disallow certain wavelengths of virtual photons
as  well,  which  is  the  basis  for  the  calculation  of  the  Casimir  force  first  done  by  H.B.  G.  Casimir  in
1948.  The  reduced  (electrically  charged)  virtual  particle  density  results  in  fewer  photon  scattering
events  inside  the  plates,  which  should  increase  the  light  velocity  between  the  plates  in  a  vacuum
relative to the normal vacuum light speed (as measured with instruments in the laboratory frame). A
similar  effect,  involving  light  velocity  change,  happens  when  light  travels  through  two  different  real
material  densities;  for  example  when  light  propagates  from  water  to  air,  a  process  known  as  optical
refraction. We also propose an experiment to demonstrate the Casimir refraction of light moving at a
shallow angle that is nearly perpendicular to a series of unequally spaced Casimir plates, which cause
a permanent shift in the direction of light propagation. Furthermore we propose a method to determine
the  index  of  refraction  for  light  propagating  from  the  ordinary  vacuum  to  the  less  dense  Casimir
vacuum.

INTRODUCTION

“The  relativistic  treatment  of  gravitation  creates  serious  difficulties.  I  consider  it  probable  that  the
principle  of  the  constancy  of  the  velocity  of  light  in  its  customary  version  holds  only  for  spaces  with
constant gravitational potential.”

- Albert Einstein  (in a letter to his friend Laub, August 10, 1911)

The subject of this work might seem like scientific heresy to the reader. No doubt many of
you  will  instantly  reject  this  proposal  on  the  grounds  that  it  violates  special  relativity.
Einstein’s 1905 prediction that the speed of light in a vacuum is an absolute constant for
all  inertial  observers  has  now  been  well  established  theoretically  and  experimentally,
although there may still be a few small cracks in the armor as witnessed by quantum non-
locality and quantum tunneling effects (section 4). Special relativity has stood the test of
time  for  95  years  without  any  evidence  to  the  contrary,  and  has  thus  become  a  corner
stone of modern theoretical physics. It would seem to be a career ending move for anyone
to propose that the light velocity in a vacuum is anything but the accepted fixed value!

Yet  we  nevertheless  propose  an  experiment  which  we  call  the  ‘Light  Velocity  Casimir’
experiment  or  the  ‘LVC’  experiment,  to  prove  that  the velocity  of  light  (front  velocity)
propagating  in  vacuum  inside  and  perpendicular  to  two  closely  spaced,  electrically
conducting and transparent plates called the Casimir plates,  will actually increase  inside
the  plates  compared  to  the  light  velocity  in  the  normal  vacuum  as  measured  in  the
laboratory  frame  (figure  1).  The  Casimir  plates  are  a  pair  of  closely  spaced,  conductive
plates, where an attractive force is observed to exist between the plates called the ‘Casimir
Force’. H.B.G. Casimir theoretically predicted the existence of this force in 1948 (ref. 6).
Recently the Casimir force has been verified experimentally for a plate spacing of about 1
micrometer,  with  an  accuracy  of  about  5%  (1996,  ref.  7),  by  using  an  electromagnetic-
based torsion pendulum. More recently U. Mohideen and A. Roy have made an even more
precise measurement of the Casimir force in the 0.1 to 0.9 micrometer plate spacing to an
accuracy of about  1% (1998, ref. 8) using the techniques of atomic force microscopy.

We believe that there must exist a ‘Vacuum Casimir Index of Refraction’  called ‘nvac’  for
light  traveling  from  outside,  and  then  through  the  Casimir  plates.  The  Casimir  vacuum
index  of  refraction  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  velocity  of  light  in  normal  vacuum
conditions  (‘c‘  or  299,792.458  km/sec)  divided  by  the  light  velocity  measured
perpendicular  to  the  Casimir  plates  in  vacuum  (‘cc‘  or  slightly  greater  than  299,792.458
km/sec). The vacuum Casimir index of refraction ‘nvac’  is given by: nvac = c / cc , which is
slightly  less  than  one  for  the  Light  Velocity  Casimir  (LVC)  experiment.  The  process  is
comparable  to  the  familiar  index  of  refraction  for  light  propagating  from  water  to  air,
where the light velocity in air is greater than the light velocity in water. Figure #2 shows a
possible experiment to observe the Casimir vacuum index of refraction by witnessing the
deflection  of  light  on  a  shallow  angle  propagating  through  a  series  of  unequally  spaced,
Casimir plates (described in section 5).

Furthermore  we  have  theoretical  reason  to  believe  that  the  index  of  refraction  nvac  will
vary with the Casimir plate spacing ‘d’, just as the Casimir force varies with plate spacing.
In  the  Casimir  force  effect  the  force  varies  as  the  inverse  fourth  power  of  the  plate
spacing.  The  light  velocity  dependence  on  plate  spacing  is  unknown  at  this  time.  Before
we  go  into  details  on  the  LVC  experiment  we  explain  precisely  what  we  mean  by  the
increase in light velocity in the vacuum.

1.1

DEFINITION OF EINSTEIN CAUSALITY

Often  in  the  literature  we  find  statements  made  regarding  Einstein  causality,  and    that
nothing  propagates  faster  than  the  speed  of  light  in  the  vacuum.  Since  light  consists  of
photons, which have both particle and wave properties, care must be taken to ensure that
velocity of light is properly defined. This is especially important when taking into account
the quantum wave packet properties of photons. In L. Brillouin classic book titled ‘Wave
Propagation  and  Group  Velocity,  1960’,  he  identified  five  different  definitions  for  the
velocity  of  a  finite-bandwidth  pulse  of  electromagnetic  radiation.  We  will  be  concerned
only with the ‘front velocity’  of light, which is defined below.

The proper definition for light velocity that we use here is the ‘front velocity’, which was
given by Sommerfield and L. Brillouin and (ref. 33). Suppose that there is a light source at
point x=0, which is switched on at the time t=0. Some distance ‘d’  away from the source
at  x,  no  effect  can  be  detected  that  is  coming  from  point  x  before  the  time  ‘d/c’.  The
beginning of the signal is a discontinuity in the signal envelope (or in a higher derivative).
The  beginning  of  the  signal  is  known  as  the  front  velocity  and  this  may  not  exceed  the
velocity  of  light  in  a  vacuum  in  order  to  fulfill  the  Einstein  causality  condition.  We
maintain that the front velocity for a beam of light traveling through the Casimir plates will
exceed  the  velocity  of  light  in  the  ordinary  vacuum  during  transit  through  the  Casimir
plates.

1.2

INTRODUCTION TO THE QUANTUM VACUUM LIGHT SCATTERING

How did we come to such a drastic conclusion regarding the increased velocity of light, in
spite  of  the  heavy  body  of  scientific  evidence  to  the  contrary?  This  conclusion  is  partly
based on our work on a new quantum theory of gravity called Electro-Magnetic Quantum
Gravity  (EMQG)  ref.  1,  which  depends  heavily  on  an  important  characteristic  of  the
quantum  vacuum;  it’s  ability  to  affect  the  velocity  of  photon  propagation  under  certain
special conditions through the familiar process called ‘Photon Scattering’.

EMQG requires a photon scattering process, photon scattering in the accelerated quantum
vacuum near the earth, in order to understand gravity and the Newtonian equivalence of
inertial  mass  and  gravitational  mass  on  a  quantum  scale.  According  to  EMQG  the  light
velocity in a region where the virtual particle vacuum density is lower than in the normal
vacuum,  is  greater  than  the  light  velocity  in  the  normal  vacuum.  This  occurs  for  an

5

observer in the laboratory frame using his clocks and rulers to measure the front velocity
of light.

According to the general principles of EMQG theory, the LVC effect occurs because:

1.  The fundamental virtual matter particles (fermions) that make up the quantum vacuum
(not  the  ZPF  or  virtual  photons  as  in  the  Casimir  force  effect)  are  ultimately
electrically charged at the lowest level, just as we believe for real ordinary matter.
2.  Since  at  the  lowest  level  the  virtual  particles  of  the  vacuum  are  electrically  charged,

they will interact with light (photon particles) propagating through the vacuum.

3.  According  to  quantum  theory  when  a  photon  interacts  with  an  electrically  charged
virtual particle, the propagation is delayed at each electrically charged virtual particle
of  the  quantum  vacuum,  before  the  photon  continues  propagating.  Why  is  there  a
photon delay? There is a time delay during the absorption and subsequent re-emission
of  the  photon  by  a  given  charged  virtual  particle.  The  uncertainty  principle  places  a
lower  limit  on  this  time  delay,  and  forbids  it  from  being  zero.  In  other  words,
according  to  the  uncertainty  principle  the  time  delay  due  to  the  absorption  and  re-
emission time of the photon cannot be exactly equal to zero.

4.  The time delay caused by the absorption and subsequent re-emission of the photon by
a  given  electrically  charged  virtual  particle  results  in  a  lower  TOTAL  AVERAGE
velocity  for  the  propagation  of  the  photons  on  the  macroscopic  distance  scale,  as
compared  to  the  average  velocity  of  the  photon  without  the  presence  of  any
constraining Casimir plates.

5.  In  the  case  of  the  vacuum  between  the  Casimir  plates,  the  virtual  fermion  particle
density in the vacuum is lower between the plates compared to that outside the plates.
The  Casimir  plates  prohibit  certain  wavelengths  of  the  fermion  wave  function  from
existing (as it does for certain photon wavelengths in the Casimir force calculation).
6.  Therefore,  the  TOTAL AVERAGE    light  velocity  inside  the  plates  must  be  greater

than that outside the plates.

 
Our review of the physics literature has not revealed any previous work on the time delay
analysis of photon propagation through the ordinary quantum vacuum or any evidence to
contradict our hypothesis of photon vacuum delay, presumably because of the precedent
set by Einstein’s postulate of light speed constancy.

Note:  Suppose  we  can  place  a  tiny  observer  A  and  his  clocks  and  rulers  (somehow)  in
between the Casimir plates. We would find for observer A that  his measurement of the
speed of light is the same as the conventional value! However for an observer B outside
the  plates  in  the  laboratory  frame,  his  measurement  does  show  an  increase  in  light
velocity  through  the  plates.  Furthermore,  the  individual  space  and  time  measurements
‘dlab’  and ‘tlab’  made by observer B in the laboratory frame do not agree with the same
measurements of ‘dplate’  and ‘tplate’  made by our tiny observer A inside the Casimir plates.
The  general  relativists  could  argue  that  the  4D  space-time  inside  the  Casimir  plates  is
altered compared to outside, and that the light velocity is still an absolute constant in all
cases!  This  argument  results  because  of  the  crucial  importance  of  light  propagation  to

6

the  fundamental  nature  of  space  and  time  measurements,  a  theme  that  was  first
championed by Einstein. This same controversy rears it’s ugly head in gravity where we
are forced to choose between the two experimentally indistinguishable views; 4D curved
space-time  in  general  relativity  and  variable  light  velocity  proposal  of  EMQG.  It  turns
out to be impossible to distinguish between curved 4D space-time in gravitational frames,
and variations in light velocity in gravitational frames experimentally. More will be said
on this important point in appendix A (section A10 and ref. 1).

Another result from EMQG states that the velocity of light without the existence of any of
the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum ought to be  much greater than the observed
average light velocity in the vacuum. The electrically charged virtual fermion particles of
the quantum vacuum frequently scatter photons, which introduce many tiny delays for the
photon propagation. This causes a great reduction in the total average light velocity in the
vacuum that is populated by countless numbers of virtual, electrically charged, particles. In
other  words;  the  low  level  light  velocity  (between  virtual  particle  scattering  events)  is
much greater than the measured average light velocity after vacuum scattering in the
normal vacuum. A similar effect is known to occur when light propagates through glass,
where photons scatter with electrons in the glass molecules, which subsequently reduces
the average light velocity through glass compared to the normal vacuum light velocity.

Here we propose an experiment that might be able to detect this predicted increase in the
velocity  of  light  between  the  Casimir  plates  in  vacuum.  The  experiment  is  designed  to
compare  the  velocity  of  light  in  the  ordinary  vacuum  against  the  light  velocity  that  is
propagating  in  between  the  Casimir  plates,  also  in  a  vacuum  state  (figure  1).  A  light
source is split into two parallel paths by a beam splitter; one path is the reference vacuum
path  of  light,  and  in  the  other  path  the  light  is  allowed  to  propagate  in  vacuum
perpendicular  to  two  closely  spaced,  electrically  conductive  and  transparent  plates.  The
two paths are then recombined by a beam splitter, and routed to an interferometer. After
the apparatus is calibrated (and if our prediction is correct), the phase of the interference
pattern will indicate that light travels faster in the Casimir plate leg of the interferometer.
Furthermore,  it  might  be  possible  to  measure  the  index  of  refraction  for  light  traveling
from the normal vacuum to the Casimir vacuum.

As  we  have  said  the  light  velocity  increases  between  the  Casimir  plates  because  the
vacuum  energy-density  in  between  the  plates  is  lower  than  that  outside  the  plates.  This
difference  in  vacuum  energy-density  or  ‘pressure’  is  actually  the  cause  of  the  attractive
force between the plates, where the energy-density is greater outside.  This implies that it
might  be  possible  to  extract  a  virtually  unlimited  supply  of  energy  the  quantum  vacuum,
which  is  an  active  area  of  recent  research  (ref.  11).  Before  we  go  into  detail  on  the
proposed LVC experiments, we present a brief introduction to the virtual particles of the
quantum vacuum that is crucial to the understanding of the LVC effect.

THE VIRTUAL PARTICLES OF THE QUANTUM VACUUM

Philosophers:

“Nature abhors a vacuum.”

In  order  to  make  a  complete  vacuum,  one  must  remove  all  matter  from  an  enclosure.
However  one  would  find  that  this  is  still  not  good  enough.  One  must  also  lower  the
temperature  inside  the  closure  to  absolute  zero  in  order  to  remove  all  thermal
electromagnetic radiation. Nernst correctly deduced in 1916 (ref. 32) that empty space is
still not completely devoid of all radiation after this is done. He predicted that the vacuum
is  still  permanently  filled  with  an  electromagnetic  field  propagating  at  the  speed  of  light,
called  the  zero-point  fluctuations  (or  sometimes  called  by  the  generic  name  ‘vacuum
fluctuations’).  This  result  was  later  confirmed  theoretically  by  the  newly  developed
quantum field theory that was developed in the 1920’s and 30’s.

Later with the development of QED (the quantum theory of electrons and photons), it was
realized  that  all  quantum  fields  should  contribute  to  the  vacuum  state.  This  means  that
virtual electrons and positron particles should not be excluded from consideration. These
particles possess mass and have multiples of half integer spin (such as the electron), and
therefore  belong  to  the  generic  class  of  particles  known  as  fermions.  We  refer  to  virtual
electrons and virtual anti-electrons (positron) particles as virtual fermions. We believe that
ultimately all fermions can be broken down to a fundamental entity that is also electrically
charged,  as  well  as  having  half  integer  spin  and  mass  (technically,  mass-charge  as
described in Appendix A).

According to modern quantum field theory, the perfect vacuum is teeming with activity as
all  types  of  quantum  virtual  particles  (and  virtual  bosons  or  the  force  carrying  particles)
from the various quantum fields appear and disappear spontaneously. These particles are
called  ‘virtual’  particles  because  they  result  from  quantum  processes  that  generally  have
short  lifetimes,  and  are  mostly  undetectable.  One  way  to  look  at  the  existence  of  the
quantum  vacuum  is  to  consider  that  quantum  theory  forbids  the  complete  absence  of
propagating fields. This is in accordance with the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
In  general,  it  is  known  that  all  the  possible  real  particles  types  (for  example  electrons,
quarks, etc.) will also be present in the quantum vacuum in their virtual particle form.

In  the  QED  vacuum,  the  quantum  fermion  vacuum  is  produced  from  the  virtual  particle
pair creation and annihilation processes that create enormous numbers of virtual electron
and virtual positron pairs. We also have in QED the creation of the zero-point-fluctuation
(ZPF)  of  the  vacuum  consisting  of  the  electromagnetic  field  or  virtual  photon  particles.
Indeed  in  the  standard  model,  we  also  find  in  the  vacuum  every  possible  boson  particle,
such as the gluons, gravitons, etc., and also every possible fermion particle, such as virtual
quarks, virtual neutrinos, etc.

2.1

INTRODUCTION TO THE CASIMIR FORCE EFFECT

The  existence  of  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  reveals  itself  in  the  famous
Casimir  effect  (ref.  6),  which  is  an  effect  predicted  theoretically  by  the  Dutch  scientist
Hendrik Casimir in 1948. The Casimir effect refers to the tiny attractive force that occurs
between two neutral metal plates suspended in a vacuum. He predicted theoretically that
the force ‘F’  per unit area ‘A’  for plate separation D is given by:

F/A    =   -  p 2 h c /(240 D4 )    Newton’s per square meter   (Casimir Force ‘F’)     (2.1)

Casimir  obtained  this  formula  by  calculating  the  sum  of  the  quantum-mechanical  zero-
point energies of the normal modes of the electromagnetic field (virtual photons) between
two conductive plates.

The  origin  of  this  minute  force  can  be  traced  to  the  disruption  of  the  normal  quantum
vacuum virtual photon distribution between two nearby metallic plates as compared to the
vacuum  state  outside  the  plates.  Certain  virtual  photon  wavelengths  (and  therefore
energies)  are  forbidden  to  exist  between  the  plates,  because  these  waves  do  not  ‘fit’
between the two plates (which are both at a relative classical electrical potential of zero).
This creates a negative pressure due to the unequal energy distribution of virtual particles
inside  the  plates  as  compared  to  those  outside  the  plate  region.  The  pressure  imbalance
can  be  visualized  as  causing  the  two  plates  to  be  drawn  together  by  radiation  pressure.
Note:  Even  in  the  vacuum  state,  the  virtual  photon  particles  do  carry  energy  and
momentum while they exist.

Although the Casimir effect has been attributed to the zero-point fluctuations (ZPF) in the
EM field inside the plates, Schwinger showed in the late 70’s that the Casimir effect can
also be derived in terms of his source theory (ref. 13), which has no explicit reference to
the ZPF of the EM field between the plates. Recently Milonni and Shih have developed a
theory of the Casimir force effect, which is totally within the framework of conventional
QED (ref. 15). Therefore it seems that it is only a matter of taste whether we attribute the
Casimir force effect to the ZPF fields or to the matter fields in vacuum (ref. 23).

Recently  Lamoreaux  made  accurate  experimental  measurements  for  the  first  time  of  the
Casimir force existing between two gold-coated quartz surfaces that were spaced on the
order of a micrometer apart (ref. 7). Lamoreaux found a force value of about 1 billionth of
a  Newton,  agreeing  with  the  Casimir  theory  to  within  an  accuracy  of  about  5%.  More
recently, U. Mohideen and A. Roy have made an even more precise measurement in the
0.1 to 0.9 micrometer plate spacing to an accuracy of about  1% (1998, ref. 8). Therefore
the experimental reality of this effect is beyond question.

Can the vacuum state be disrupted by other physical processes besides the Casimir plates?
One  might  ask  what  happens  to  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  that  are
subjected  to  a  large  gravitational  field  like  the  earth?  Since  the  quantum  vacuum  is
composed of virtual fermions (as well as virtual bosons), the conclusion is inescapable: all

9

the  virtual  fermions  possessing  mass  must  be  falling  (accelerating)  on  the  average
towards  the  earth  during  their  very  brief  lifetimes.  This  vacuum  state  is  definitely
different  from  the  vacuum  of  far  outer  space  away  from  gravitational  fields.  Yet  to  our
knowledge, no previous authors have acknowledged the existence of this effect, or studied
the physical consequences that result from this. It turns out that the free fall state of the
virtual,  electrically  charged  fermion  particles  of  the  vacuum  is  actually  the  root  cause  of
4D  space-time  curvature  and  also  leads  to  a  full  understanding  of  the  principle  of
equivalence. In EMQG (appendix A) we fully study the consequences of a falling quantum
vacuum in quantum gravity, which does lead to new experimentally testable predictions.

The  physics  of  the  Casimir  force  effect  implies  that  the  quantum  vacuum  contains  an
enormous  reservoir  of  energy  (ref.  11).  Although  in  standard  quantum  field  theory  the
number density of virtual particles is unlimited, some estimates place a high frequency cut-
off at the plank scale which is estimated to be a density of 1090 particles per cubic meter
(ref.  11)!  Generally  this  energy-density  is  not  available  because  the  energy-density  is
uniform and it permeates everything. It’s like the situation in the deep ocean, where deep
sea  fishes  easily  tolerate  the  extreme  pressures  in  the  abyss,  because  the  pressure  inside
and outside the fish’s body balance. If a human goes into these depths, a great difference
in  pressure  must  be  maintained  to  support  atmospheric  pressure  inside  the  human  body.
Some physicists are looking at ways in which this vast energy reservoir can be tapped (ref.
11)

If the vacuum is capable of exerting a mechanical force between the two Casimir plates,
might  the  vacuum’s  effect  be  felt  in  a  less  exotic  way?  Most  physicists  believe  that  the
answer is no. Yet there is a small number of physicist who believe otherwise. In 1994, R.
Haisch,  A.  Rueda,  and  H.  Puthoff  (ref.  5)  were  the  first  to  propose  a  theory  of  inertia
(known  here  as  HRP  Inertia),  where  the  quantum  vacuum  played  a  central  role  in
Newtonian  inertia.  They  suggested  that  inertia  is  due  to  the  strictly  local  electrical  force
interactions of charged matter particles with the immediate background virtual particles of
the  quantum  vacuum.  We  have  built  on  their  work  and  developed  a  theory  of  quantum
gravity  and  quantum  inertia  based  on  their  idea.  According  to  EMQG,  the  quantum
vacuum  affects  all  masses  that  are  in  the  state  of  acceleration.  In  the  EMQG  model,  the
force of inertia is actually caused by the resistance force to acceleration by the electrical
force  interactions  between  charged  particles  that  make  up  a  mass  and  the  electrically
charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. We call this quantum inertia, which plays
a  central  role  in  our  quantum  theory  of  gravity  that  closely  links  inertia  and  gravity.  We
introduce  this  important  concept  in  section  2.3  (this  section  can  be  omitted  if  desired,
since it is not essential in order to understand the LVC experiments).

EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF VIRTUAL PARTICLES (** Optional)

There  is  other  evidence  for  the  existence  of  virtual  particles  besides  the  Casimir  force
effect. We present a very brief review of some theoretical and experimental evidence for
the existence of the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum:

(1) The extreme precision in the theoretical calculations of the hyper-fine structure of the
energy levels of the hydrogen atom, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron
and muon are both based on the existence of virtual particles in the framework of QED.
These  effects  have  been  calculated  in  QED  to  a  very  high  precision  (approximately  10
decimal  places),  and  these  values  have  also  been  verified  experimentally  to  an
unprecedented accuracy. This indeed is a great achievement for QED, which is essentially
a  perturbation  theory  of  the  electromagnetic  quantum  vacuum.  Indeed,  this  is  one  of
physics greatest achievements.

(2)  Recently,  vacuum  polarization  (the  polarization  of  electron-positron  pairs  near  a  real
electron  particle)  has  been  observed  experimentally  by  a  team  of  physicists  led  by  David
Koltick.  Vacuum  polarization  causes  a  cloud  of  virtual  particles  to  form  around  the
electron in such a way as to produce an electron charge screening effect. This is because
virtual positrons tend to migrate towards the real electron, and the virtual electrons tend
to migrate away. A team of physicists fired high-energy particles at electrons, and found
that the effect of this cloud of virtual particles was reduced the closer a particle penetrated
towards the electron. They reported that the effect of the higher charge for the penetration
of the electron cloud with energetic 58 giga-electron volt particles was equivalent to a fine
structure constant of 1/129.6. This agreed well with their theoretical prediction of 128.5
of QED. This can be taken as verification of the vacuum polarization effect predicted by
QED, and further evidence for the existence of the quantum vacuum.

(3)  The  quantum  vacuum  explains  why  cooling  alone  will  never  freeze  liquid  helium.
Unless  pressure  is  applied,  vacuum  energy  fluctuations  prevent  its  atoms  from  getting
close enough to trigger solidification.

(4) For fluorescent strip lamps, the random energy fluctuations of the virtual particles of
the  quantum  vacuum  cause  the  atoms  of  mercury,  which  are  in  their  exited  state,  to
spontaneously  emit  photons  by  eventually  knocking  them  out  of  their  unstable  energy
orbital.  In  this  way,  spontaneous  emission  in  an  atom  can  be  viewed  as  being  directly
caused by the state of the surrounding quantum vacuum.

(5) In electronics, there is a limit as to how much a radio signal can be amplified. Random
noise  signals  are  always  added  to  the  original  signal.  This  is  due  to  the  presence  of  the
virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  as  the  real  radio  photons  from  the  transmitter
propagate in space. The vacuum fluctuations add a random noise pattern to the signal by
slightly modifying the energy of the propagating radio photons.

(6)  Recent  theoretical  and  experimental  work  done  in  the  field  of  Cavity  Quantum
Electrodynamics suggests that the orbital electron transition time for excited atoms can be
affected  by  the  state  of  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  immediately
surrounding  the  excited  atom  in  a  cavity,  where  the  size  of  the  cavity  modifies  the
spectrum of the virtual particles.

In the weight of all this evidence, only a few physicists doubt the existence of the virtual
particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum.  Yet  to  us,  it  seems  strange  that  the  quantum  vacuum
should  barely  reveal  it’s  presence  to  us,  and  that  we  only  know  about  it’s  existence
through  rather  obscure  physical  effects  like  the  Casimir  force  effect  and  Davies-Unruh
effect.  This  is  especially  odd  considering  that  the  observable  particles  of  ordinary  real
matter in an average cubic meter of space in the universe constitute a minute fraction of
the  total  population  of  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  at  any  given  instant  of
time.

Some estimates of the quantum vacuum particle density (ref. 11) place the vacuum particle
numbers  at  about  1090  particles  per  cubic  meter!  Instead,  we  believe  that  the  quantum
vacuum plays a much more prominent role in physics. We maintain that the effects of the
quantum vacuum are present in virtually all physical activity. In fact, Newton’s three laws
of motion can be understood to originate directly from the effects of the quantum vacuum
(Appendix  A).  Furthermore,  the  quantum  vacuum  plays  an  extremely  important  role  in
gravity, which is generally well understood by the physics community.

In order not to distract the reader from the main theme of this paper, we have included a
brief review of EMQG theory which summarizes the central role that light scattering in the
accelerated quantum vacuum has in our quantum gravity theory; and for the principle of
equivalence, inertia, and 4D space-time curvature. This can be found in Appendix A of this
paper.  A  full  account  is  given  in  reference  1.  We  provide  an  optional  introduction  to
Quantum Inertia in the next section for those readers who are interested.

2.3

INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM INERTIA THEORY (** Optional)

Recently  it  has  been  proposed  that  Newtonian  Inertia  is  strictly  a  quantum  vacuum
phenomenon! If this is true, then the existence of the quantum vacuum actually reveals it’s
presence to us in all daily activities! Unlike the hard-to-measure Casimir force effect, the
presence  of  the  inertial  force  is  universal  and  it’s  presence  prevails  throughout  all  of
physics.  For  example,  the  orbital  motion  of  the  earth  around  the  sun  is  a  balancing  act
between  inertia  force  and  gravitational  force.  If  quantum  inertia  is  true,  every  time  you
accelerate, you are witnessing a quantum vacuum effect! This is a far cry from an exotic
and almost impossible measurement of the feeble Casimir force between two plates.

In 1994, R. Haisch, A. Rueda, and H. Puthoff (ref. 5) were the first to propose a theory of
inertia (known here as HRP Inertia), where the quantum vacuum played a central role in
Newtonian  inertia.  They  suggested  that  inertia  is  due  to  the  strictly  local  electrical  force

12

interactions of charged matter particles with the immediate background virtual particles of
the  quantum  vacuum  (in  particular  the  virtual  photons  or  ZPF  as  the  authors  called  it).
They found that inertia is caused by the magnetic component of the Lorentz force, which
arises  between  what  the  author’s  call  the  charged  ‘parton’  particles  in  an  accelerated
reference  frame  interacting  with  the  background  quantum  vacuum  virtual  particles.  The
sum of all these tiny forces in this process is the source of the resistance force opposing
accelerated  motion  in  Newton’s  F=MA.  The  ‘parton’  is  a  term  that  Richard  Feynman
coined  for  the  constituents  of  the  nuclear  particles  such  as  the  proton  and  neutron  (now
called quarks).

We have found it necessary to make a small modification to HRP Inertia theory as a result
of our investigation of the principle of equivalence. Our modified version of HRP inertia is
called  “Quantum  Inertia”  (or  QI),  and  is  described  in  detail  in  Appendix  A.  This  theory
also  resolves  the  long  outstanding  problems  and  paradoxes  of  accelerated  motion
introduced by Mach’s principle, by suggesting that the vacuum particles themselves serve
as Mach’s universal reference frame (for acceleration only), without violating the principle
of relativity of constant velocity motion. In other words our universe offers no observable
reference frame to gauge inertial frames (non-accelerated frames where Newton’s laws of
inertia  are  valid),  because  the  quantum  vacuum  offers  no  means  to  determine  absolute
constant  velocity  motion.  However  for  accelerated  motion,  the  quantum  vacuum  plays  a
very  important  role  by  offering  a  resistance  to  acceleration,  which  results  in  an  inertial
force  opposing  the  acceleration  of  the  mass.  Thus  the  very  existence  of  inertial  force
reveals  the  absolute  value  of  the  acceleration  with  respect  to  the  net  statistical  average
acceleration  of  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum.  If  this  is  correct  then
Newton’s three famous laws of motion can be understood at the quantum level (ref. 20).

There  have  been  various  clues  to  the  importance  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum
vacuum for the accelerated motion of real charged particles. One example is the so-called
Davies-Unruh effect (ref. 18), where uniform and linearly accelerated charged particles in
the vacuum are immersed in a heat bath, with a temperature proportional to acceleration
(with  the  scale  of  the  quantum  heat  effects  being  very  low).  However,  the  work  of
reference 5 is the first place we have clearly seen the identification of inertial forces as the
direct consequence of the interactions of real matter particles with the quantum vacuum.

It  has  also  even  been  suggested  that  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  are
somehow  involved  in  gravitational  interactions.  The  prominent  Russian  physicist  A.
Sakharov proposed in 1968 (ref. 16) that Newtonian gravity could be interpreted as a van
der Waals type of force induced by the electromagnetic fluctuations of the virtual particles
of  the  quantum  vacuum.  Sakharov  visualized  ordinary  neutral  matter  as  a  collection  of
electromagnetically,  interacting  polarizable  particles  made  of  charged  point-mass  sub-
particles  (partons).  He  associated  the  Newtonian  gravitational  field  with  the  Van  Der
Waals force present in neutral matter, where the long-range radiation fields are generated
by the parton ‘Zitterbewegung’. Sakharov went on to develop what he called the ‘metric
elasticity’  concept,  where  space-time  is  somehow  identified  with  the  ‘hydrodynamic
elasticity’  of the vacuum. However, he did not understand the important clues about the

13

quantum  vacuum  that  are  revealed  by  the  equivalence  principle,  nor  the  role  that  the
quantum  vacuum  played  in  inertia  and  Mach’s  principle.  We  maintain  that  the  quantum
vacuum  also  make  it’s  presence  felt  in  a  very big  way  in  all  gravitational  interactions
(Appendix A) just as it does in inertia!

There  have  been  further  hints  that  the  quantum  vacuum  is  involved  in  gravitational
physics. In 1974 Hawkings (ref. 17) announced that black holes are not completely black.
Black holes emit an outgoing thermal flux of radiation due to gravitational interactions of
the black hole with the virtual particle pairs created in the quantum vacuum near the event
horizon.  At  first  sight  the  emission  of  thermal  radiation  from  a  black  hole  seems
paradoxical, since nothing can escape from the event horizon. However the spontaneous
creation  of  virtual  particle  and  anti-particle  pairs  in  the  quantum  vacuum  near  the  event
horizon can be used to explain this effect (ref. 18). Heuristically one can imagine that the
virtual particle pairs (that are created with wavelength l
 that is approximately equal to the
size  of  the  black  hole)  ‘tunnel’  out  of  the  event  horizon.  For  a  virtual  particle  with  a
wavelength comparable to the size of the hole, strong tidal forces operate to prevent re-
annihilation.  One  virtual  particle  escapes  to  infinity  with  positive  energy  to  contribute  to
the  Hawking  radiation,  while  the  corresponding  antiparticle  enters  the  black  hole  to  be
trapped forever by the deep gravitational potential. Thus the quantum vacuum is important
in order to properly understand the Hawking radiation.

As a result of all these and other considerations, we have developed a new approach to the
unification  of  quantum  theory  with  general  relativity  referred  to  as  Electro-Magnetic
Quantum  Gravity  or  EMQG  (ref.  1  and  summary  in  appendix  A).  EMQG  had  its  early
origins  in  Cellular  Automata  (CA)  theory  (ref.  2,4,9  and  34),  and  on  a  theory  of  inertia
proposed  by  R.  Haisch,  A.  Rueda,  and  H.  Puthoff  (ref.  5).  In  EMQG,  the  quantum
vacuum plays an extremely important, if not a central role, in both inertia and gravitation.
It  also  plays  a  major  role  in  the  origin  of  4D  curved  space-time  curvature  near
gravitational sources.

We  maintain  that  anybody  who  believes  in  the  existence  of  the  virtual  particles  of  the
quantum  vacuum  and  accepts  the  fact  that  many  virtual  particles  carry  mass  (virtual
fermions),  will  have  no  trouble  in  believing  that  the  virtual  particles  of  the  vacuum  are
falling  in  the  presence  of  a  large  gravitational  mass  like  the  earth  during  their  brief
lifetimes.  We  believe  the  existence  of  the  downward  accelerating  virtual  particles,  under
the  action  of  a  large  gravitational  field,  turns  out  to  be  the  missing link  between  inertia
and  gravity.  It  leads  us  directly  to  a  full  understanding  of  the  principle  of  equivalence.
Although  the  quantum  vacuum  has  been  studied  in  much  detail  in  the  past,  to  our
knowledge no one has examined the direct consequences of a quantum vacuum in a state
of free-fall near the earth. This concept is the central theme behind EMQG. Reference 14
offers  an  excellent  introduction  to  the  motion  of  matter  in  the  presence  of  the  quantum
vacuum,  and  on  the  history  of  the  discovery  of  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum
vacuum.

14

We propose that the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum can be viewed as kind of a
transparent  fluid  medium,  sort  of  like  a  kind  of  a  21th  century  “ether”.  Unlike  ordinary
transparent  fluids  like  water,  the  vacuum  does  not  resist  constant  velocity  motion.
However  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  can  be  made  to  take  on  a
coordinated  (average)  accelerated  motion  with  respect  to  an  observer  in  two  different
physical  instances,  and  this  has  very  important  consequences  for  mass  particles  in  the
following two cases:

(1)  The  quantum  vacuum  looks  disturbed  from  the  perspective  of  a  mass  that  is  being
accelerated (by a rocket for example). Here the observer and his mass are the physical
entities  that  are  actually  accelerating,  and  the  quantum  vacuum  only  appears  to  be
accelerated in the reference frame of the observer. Here the vacuum acceleration is not
actually real!  However,  the  quantum  vacuum  effects  are  very  real,  and  are  the  root
cause of inertial force.

(2)  The vacuum actually is disturbed by the presence of a near-by gravitational field of a
large mass, like the earth. In this case, the coordinated vacuum particle (net average)
acceleration with respect to the earth’s surface is real, and is caused by direct graviton
exchanges  between  the  earth  and  the  individual  virtual  fermion  particles  of  the
quantum  vacuum.  Therefore,  the  vacuum  fluid  can  be  viewed  as  falling  just  as  the
Niagara  Water  Falls.  However  the  vacuum  fluid  does  not  accumulate  at  the  earth’s
surface as a real liquid water fluid might, because the virtual particles are short lived
and are constantly being replaced by new ones.

These  considerations  imply  that  Newton’s  principle  of  equivalence  of  gravitational  mass
and inertial mass can be understood to be caused by the virtual particles of the quantum
vacuum.  The  inertial  mass  ‘m’  is  defined  in  the  formula  F  =  ma,  and  has  the  same
magnitude  as  the  gravitational  mass  ‘m’  defined  in  F  =  GmMe/r2,  which  are  two
independent definitions for the same mass value. Newton equivalence results because:

The  quantum  vacuum  looks  the  same  from  the  perspective  of  an
accelerated mass ‘m’  on the floor of a rocket accelerated at 1g, as it does
from the perspective of a stationary mass ‘m’  on the earth!

In order to see how the Newtonian Equivalence principle of inertia and gravitational mass
follows from the accelerated quantum vacuum effects, we only have to recall our Quantum
Inertia principle:

The  cause  of  inertia  is  the  electrical  resistance  force  that  appears  between  the
electrically charged, real matter particles that constitute a mass, and the surrounding
electrically  charged,  virtual  fermions  of  the  quantum  vacuum,  where  there  exists  a
state of relative acceleration between the real and virtual particle species.

In  other  words,  an  accelerated  mass  feels  the  inertial  force  from  the  sum  of  the  tiny
electrical forces that originate from each electrically charged particle that make up a mass.

15

Similarly the gravitational mass of the same object, stationary on the earth’s surface, also
feels the exact same sum of the tiny electrical forces that originate from each electrically
charged particle that make up a mass, where now it’s the virtual particles of the quantum
vacuum  that  accelerates  downwards.  What  is  the  cause  of  the  vacuum  particle
acceleration  on  the  earth?  According  to  EMQG,  which  is  a  quantum  field  theory  of
gravity,  it  is  the  graviton  exchanges  between  the  fermion  particles  of  the  earth  and  the
virtual  fermion  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum.  These  ideas  are  fully  elaborated  in
EMQG  theory  in  Appendix  A  (attached).  We  now  review  the  basic  notions  of  photon
scattering in real matter and in the quantum vacuum.

3. 

LIGHT SCATTERING THEORY

Since  photon  scattering  is  essential  to  our  model  of  the  predicted  LVC  effect  (and  in
EMQG theory), we will examine the general principles of photon scattering in some detail.
First we review the conventional physics of light scattering in a  real media such as water
or glass, including the concept of the index of refraction and Snell’s Law of refraction. We
also  introduce  photon  scattering  when  the  real  media  is  moving  at  a  constant  velocity,
where  the  velocity  of  light  varies  in  the  moving  media  and  known  as  the  Fizeau  effect.
Next  we  introduce  an  accelerated  medium  for  the  real  medium  and  examine  how  the
photons scatter. This is important to understanding EMQG theory. Readers that are only
interested  in  the  LVC  affect  can  skip  sections  3.3,  3.5  and  3.6.  We  generalize  these
arguments  to  examine  photon  scattering  with  the  electrically  charged  virtual  particles  of
the quantum vacuum.

3.1

CLASSICAL SCATTERING OF PHOTONS IN REAL MATTER

It is a well-known result of classical optics that light moves slower in glass than in air.
Furthermore it is recognized that the velocity of light in air is slower than that of light’s
vacuum velocity. This effect is described by the index of refraction ‘n’, which is the ratio
of light velocities in the two different media. The Feynman Lectures on Physics gives one
of the best accounts of the classical theory for the origin of the refractive index and the
slowing of light through a transparent material like glass (ref. 42, chap. 31 contains the
mathematical details).

When light passes from a vacuum into glass, with an incident angle of q 0 it deflects and
changes it’s direction and moves at a new angle q 1 , where the angles follow Snell’s law:

n = sin q 0 / sin q 1 

          (3.11)

This follows geometrically because the wave crests on both sides of the surface of the
glass must have the same spacing, since they must travel together (ref. 42). The shortest
distance between crests of the wave is the wavelength divided by the frequency. On the
vacuum side of the glass surface it is l 0 = 2p c/w
 =

, and on the other side it is given by l

16

 or 2p c / w n since we define v=c/n. If we accept this, then Snell’s law follows
2p v/w
geometrically (ref. 42). In some sense, the existence of the index of refraction in Snell’s
law is confirmation of the change in light speed going from the vacuum to glass.

Snell’s law does not tell us why we have a change in light velocity, nor does it give us any
insight into the phenomena of dispersion and back scattering of light in refraction. A good
classical account of the derivation of the index of refraction is given by Feynman himself in
ref.  42.  Feynman  derives  the  index  of  refraction  for  a  transparent  medium  by  accepting
that the total electric field in any physical circumstance can be represented by the sum of
the fields from all charge sources, and by accepting that the field from a single charge is
given by it’s acceleration evaluated with a retardation speed ‘c’  (the propagation speed of
the exchanged photons). We only summarize the important points of his argument below,
and the full details are available in reference 42:

(1) The  incoming  source  electromagnetic  wave  (light)  consists  of  an  oscillating  electric
and magnetic field. The glass consists of electrons bound elastically to the atoms, such
that if a force is applied to an electron the displacement from its normal position will
be proportional to the force.

(2) The  oscillating  electric  field  of  the  light  causes  the  electron  to  be  driven  in  an
oscillating  motion,  thus  acting  like  a  new  radiator  generating  a  new  electromagnetic
wave. This new wave is always delayed, or retarded in phase. These delays result from
the time delay required for the bound electron to oscillate to full amplitude. Recall that
the  electron  carries  mass  and  therefore  inertia.  Therefore  some  time  is  required  to
move the electron.

(3) The  total  resulting  electromagnetic  wave  is  the  sum  of  the  source  electromagnetic
wave  plus  the  new  phase-delayed  electromagnetic  wave,  where  the  total  resulting
wave is phase-shifted.

(4) The resulting phase delay of the electromagnetic wave is the root cause of the reduced

velocity of light observed in the medium.

Feynman goes on to derive the classic formula for the index of refraction for atoms with
several different resonant frequency w

k which is given by:

n = 1 +  [qe

2 / (2e0m)]   S

k  Nk / [ w

2 - w 2 + ig kw ]

k

             (3.12)

where n is the index of refraction, qe is the electron charge, m is the electron mass, w
 is the
incoming light frequency, g k is the damping factor, and Nk is the number of atoms per unit
volume.  This  formula  describes  the  index  of  refraction  for  many  substances,  and  also
describes the dispersion of light through the medium. Dispersion is the phenomenon where
the index of refraction of a media varies with the frequency of the incoming light, and is
the  reason  that  a  glass  prism  bends  light  more  in  the  blue  end  than  the  red  end  of  the
spectrum.

17

If the medium consists of free, unbound electrons in the form of a gas such as in a plasma
(or  as  the  conduction  electrons  in  a  simple  metal)  then  the  index  of  refraction  with  the
conditions g k <<  w

k = 0 is given by (ref. 42):

 QUANTUM FIELD THEORY OF PHOTON SCATTERING IN MATTER

Although the classical account of scattering predicts the experimentally confirmed results,
the  correct  account  must  be  a  quantum  mechanical  account.  To  quote  R.  Feynman
himself:                               “  …  yes, but the world is quantum not classical  dam-it”.

The propagation of light through a transparent medium is a very difficult subject in QED.
It is impossible to compute the interaction of a collection of atoms with light exactly. In
fact,  it  is  impossible  to  treat  even  one  atom’s  interaction  with  light  exactly  in  QED.
However  the  interaction  of  a  real  atom  with  photons  can  be  approximated  by  a  simpler
quantum system. Since in many cases only two atomic energy levels play a significant role
in the interaction of the electromagnetic field with atoms, the atom can be represented by a
quantum system with only two energy eigenstates.

In  the  text  book  “Optical  Coherence  and  Quantum  Optics”  a  thorough  treatment  of  the
absorption  and  emission  of  photons  in  two-level  atoms  is  given  (ref.  43,  Chap.  15,  pg.
762).  When  a  photon  is  absorbed,  and  later  a  new  photon  of  the  same  frequency  is  re-
emitted by an electron bound to an atom, there exists a time delay before the photon re-
emission. The probabilities for emission and absorption of a photon is given as a function
of time D

t for an atom frequency of w 0 and photon frequency of w 1 :

Probability of Photon Absorption is:    K  [ sin (0.5(w 1 - w 0) D
Probability of Photon Emission  is:      M  [ sin (0.5(w 1 - w 0) D

t)  / ( 0.5(w 1 - w 0)) ]2
t)  / ( 0.5(w 1 - w 0)) ]2

            (3.21)

(where K and M are complex expressions defined in ref. 43)

The important point we want to make from eq. 3.21 is that the probability of absorption or
emission depends on the length of time D
t, where the probability of the emission is zero, if
the  time  D
t  =  0.  In  other  words  according  to  QED,  a  finite  time  is  required  before  re-
emission of the photon. There are other factors that affect the probability, of course. For
example, the closer the frequency of the photon matches the atomic frequency, the higher
the probability of re-emission in some given time period. We maintain that these delays are
the actual route cause of the index of refraction in a medium.

18

»
We  believe  that  a  similar  thing  happens  when  photons  propagate  through  the  quantum
vacuum. Therefore, we want to address the effect of the virtual particles of the quantum
vacuum on the propagation velocity of real (non-virtual) photons, a subject that is largely
ignored in the physics literature.

3.3

THE SCATTERING OF PHOTONS IN THE QUANTUM VACUUM

In  section  3.1  we  discussed  photon  scattering  in  a  real  matter  medium  and  in  a  real
negatively  charged  electron  gas.  The  electron  gas  model  is  the  closest  model  we  have
towards understanding the Casimir index of refraction of the quantum vacuum. However,
there are several important differences between the charged electron gas medium and the
electrically charged virtual fermion particles of the quantum vacuum as a medium.

First, and most importantly, virtual particles do not carry any net average energy. Instead
an  individual  virtual  particle  ‘borrows’  a  small  amount  of  energy  during  it’s  brief
existence, which is then paid back quickly in accordance to the uncertainty principle. It is
because  quantum  mechanics  forbids  knowing  the  value  of  two  complementary  variables
precisely (in this case energy and existence time) for a virtual particle that virtual particles
are  allowed  to  exist  at  all.  Therefore  unlike  the  electron  gas,  the  vacuum  is  incapable  of
permanently absorbing light that propagates through it.

Thus  the  quantum  vacuum  does  not  absorb  any  light  over  macroscopic  distance  scales.
This  statement  seems  trivial,  but  it  is  never-the-less  important  when  considering  the
quantum vacuum as a medium. On microscopic scales real photons are absorbed and re-
emitted by individual virtual particles, in accordance with QED. Photon energy is lost in
some collisions and regained in others so that on the average the energy loss is zero. This
is because during the brief existence time of a virtual fermion particle, the virtual particle
does  possess  energy,  which  is  paid  back  almost  immediately.  This  quantum  process
happens  an  enormous  number  of  times  as  light  travels  through  macroscopic  distance
scales. The energy balances out to zero over sufficiently large distance scales.

Furthermore  unlike  the  electron  gas,  there  can  be  no  dispersion  of  light  in  the  quantum
vacuum.  In  other  words  all  frequencies  of  electromagnetic  radiation  move  at  the  same
speed  through the quantum vacuum in spite of the incredible numbers of virtual particle
interactions  that  occur  for  any  particular  frequency  of  photon.  Zero  dispersion  follows
experimentally from many astronomical observations of distant supernova, where there is
a  dramatic  change  in  light  and  electromagnetic  radiation  with  time.  Observations  have
been made of specific events in the light curves of supernovae light curves that range from
the  radio  band  frequencies  to  the  X-ray  /  Gamma  Ray  frequencies.  All  the  different
frequencies are observed to arrive on the earth at the same time.

With distances of thousands or millions of light years away, any discrepancy in the photon
velocity of supernovae at different frequencies would be very apparent. For example with

19

the  relatively  nearby  supernova  1987A  (which  exploded  about  160,000  years  ago  in  the
Large  Magellanic  cloud)  all  the  different  frequencies  of  EM  waves  has  reached  us  very
much at the same time. If there had been a dispersion of only 0.01 m/sec in light velocity
(i.e.  3  parts  in  10-11)  between  two  different  frequencies,  then  the  light  of  one  frequency
would arrive on the earth:

160000 x 365.25 x 24 x 60 x 60 x 10-2 / (3x10-8) =170 seconds or 2.8 minutes later!

A  result  like  this  obviously  disagrees  with  observations  made  of  the  spectrum  of
supernova  1987A.  Spectra  have  been  obtained  for  very  distant  supernovae  up  to  a  few
billion  light  years  away  in  other  galaxies.  One  study  places  the  maximum  allowed
dispersion to be on the order of 1 part in 10-21 (ref. xx). Thus we conclude that there is no
dispersion of light in the vacuum.

Is  there  a  possibility  for  an  index  of  refraction  in  the  vacuum,  as  we  have  in  an  electron
gas?  Remember  that  an  index  of  refraction  requires  two  different  media  in  which  to
compare the relative velocities of light. However the vacuum particle density must nearly
uniform, with no transitions in density. Let us imagine a situation where somehow we have
removed all the virtual particles in half of an empty box in vacuum, and the other half has
the  normal  population  of  virtual  particles  in  the  normal  quantum  vacuum  state.  Would
there be an index of refraction as light traveled from one side of the box to the other?

This  is  a  very  important  question  because  the  validity  of  special  relativity  at  the  sub-
microscopic distance scales comes into question here. You might think that if the vacuum
has no energy, there should no effect on the propagation speed of photons. However we
believe  that  the  virtual  particles  in  the  quantum  vacuum  do  indeed  delay  the  progress  of
photons  through  electrically  charged  vacuum  particle  scattering  effects.  Thus  we  believe
that  photon  scattering  reduces  the  light  velocity  on  the  half  of  the  box  with  electrically
charged  virtual  particles.  How  can  we  justify  this  belief,  in  spite  of  the  contradiction  to
special  relativity?  Special  relativity  is  a  classical  theory,  and  was  developed  in  the
macroscopic domain of physics. It is almost impossible to measure light velocities over the
extremely short distance scales that we are talking about.

t, which satisfies the uncertainty principle: D E  D

The electrically charged virtual particles in the quantum vacuum all have random velocities
and move in random directions. They also have random energies D E during their brief life
t  >  h/(2p ).  Imagine  a  real  photon
time D
propagating in a straight path through the electrically charged virtual particles in a given
direction.  The  real  photon  will  encounter  an  equal  number  of  virtual  particles  moving
towards it as it does moving away from it. The end result is that the electrically charged
quantum vacuum particles do not contribute anything different than the situation where all
the virtual particles in the it’s path were at relative rest. Thus we can consider the vacuum
as  some  sort  of  stationary  crystal  medium  of  virtual  particles  with  a  very  high  density,
where each virtual particle is short-lived and constantly replaced (and carry no net average
energy as discussed above).

20

The  progress  of  the  real  photon  is  delayed  as  it  travels  through  this  quantum  vacuum
‘crystal’,  where  it  meets  uncountable  numbers  of  electrically  charged  virtual  particles.
Light  travels  through  this  with  no  absorption  or  dispersion.  Based  on  our  general
arguments in the sections 3.1 to 3.4 above, we  postulate that the photon is delayed as it
travels through the quantum vacuum. We can definitely say that the uncertainty principle
places a lower limit on the emission and absorption time delay, and forbids the time delay
from being exactly equal to zero.

Therefore  we  conclude  that  the  electrically  charged  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum
vacuum  frequently  absorb  and  re-emit  the  real  photons  moving  through  the  vacuum
by  introducing  small  delays  during  absorption  and  subsequent  re-emission  of  the
photon,  thus  reducing  the  average  propagation  speed  of  the  photons  in  the  vacuum
(compared to the light speed of photons between absorption/re-emission events).

Our  examination  of  the  physics  literature  has  not  revealed  any  previous  work  on  a
quantum  time  delay  analysis  of  photon  propagation  through  the  quantum  vacuum,
presumably because of the precedent set by Einstein’s postulate of light speed constancy in
the  vacuum  under  all  circumstances.  We  will  take  the  position  that  the  delays  due  to
photon  scattering  through  the  quantum  vacuum  are  real.  These  delays  reduce  the  much
faster  and  absolutely  fixed  ‘low-level  light  velocity  cl’  (defined  as  the  photon  velocity
between  vacuum  particle  scattering  events)  to  the  average  observed  light  velocity  ‘c’  in
the vacuum (300,000 km/sec) that we observe in our actual experiments.

Furthermore, we propose that the quantum vacuum introduces a sort of Vacuum Index of
Refraction ‘nvac’  (compared to a vacuum without all virtual particles) such that c = cl / nvac.
If this is true, what is the low-level light velocity? It is unknown at this time, but it must be
significantly  larger  than  300,000  km/sec.  In  fact  we  believe  that  the  vacuum  index  of
refraction ‘nvac’ must be very large because of the  high density of virtual particles in the
vacuum.  This  concept  is  required  in  EMQG  theory,  and  has  become  central  to
understanding the equivalence principle and 4D space-time curvature in accelerated frames
and in gravitational fields (Appendix A).

FIZEAU EFFECT: LIGHT VELOCITY IN A MOVING MEDIA (** Optional)

It also has been known for over a century that the velocity of light in a moving medium
differs  from  its  value  in  the  same  stationary  medium.  Fizeau  demonstrated  this
experimentally  in  1851  (ref.  41).  For  example,  with  a  current  of  water  (with  refractive
index  of  the  medium  of  n=4/3)  flowing  with  a  velocity  V  of  about  5  m/sec,  the  relative
variation in the light velocity is 10-8 (which he measured by use of interferometry). Fresnel
first  derived  the  formula  (ref.  41)  in  1810  with  his  ether  dragging  theory.  The  resulting
formula  relates  the  longitudinal  light  velocity  ‘vc’  moving  in  the  same  direction  as  a
transparent medium of an index of refraction ‘n’  defined such that ‘c/n’  is the light velocity
in  the  stationary  medium,  which  is  moving  with  velocity  ‘V’  (with  respect  to  the
laboratory frame), where c is the velocity of light in the vacuum:

21

Fresnel Formula:   vc = c/n  +  (1 – 1/n2) V 

             (3.41)

Why  does  the  velocity  of  light  vary  in  a  moving  (and  non-moving)  transparent  medium?
According  to  the  principles  of  special  relativity,  the  velocity  of  light  is  a  constant  in  the
vacuum  with  respect  to  all  inertial  observers.  When  Einstein  proposed  this  postulate,  he
was not aware that the vacuum is not empty. However he was aware of Fresnel’s formula
and derived it by the special relativistic velocity addition formula for parallel velocities (to
first  order).  According  to  special  relativity,  the  velocity  of  light  relative  to  the  proper
frame of the transparent medium depends only on the medium. The velocity of light in the
stationary medium is defined as ‘c/n’. Recall that velocities u and v add according to the
formula:  (u + v) / (1 + uv/c2)
Therefore:

vc = [ c/n + V ] / [ 1 + (c/n) (V)/c2 ]   =  (c/n + V) / ( 1 + V/(nc) )  »

  c/n + (1 – 1/n2) V

  (3.42)

The special relativistic approach to deriving the Fresnel formula does not say much about
the actual quantum processes going on at the atomic level. At this scale, there are several
explanations  for  the  detailed  scattering  process  in  conventional  physics.  We  investigate
these different approaches in more detail below.

3.5

 LORENTZ SEMI-CLASSICAL PHOTON SCATTERING (** Optional)

The  microscopic  theory  of  the  light  propagation  in  matter  was  developed  as  a
consequence of Lorentz’s  non-relativistic,  semi-classical  electromagnetic  theory.  We  will
review and summarize this approach to photon scattering, which will not only prove useful
for  our  analysis  of  the  Fizeau  effect,  but  has  become  the  basis  of  the  ‘Fizeau-like’
scattering  of  photons  in  the  accelerated  quantum  vacuum  near  large  gravitational  fields
(EMQG theory, Appendix A).

To  understand  what  happens  in  photon  scattering  inside  a  moving  medium,  imagine  a
simplified  one-dimensional  quantum  model  of  the  propagation  of  light  in  a  refractive
medium. The medium consisting of an idealized moving crystal of velocity  ‘V’,  which  is
composed  of  evenly  spaced,  point-like  atoms  of  spacing  ‘l’.  When  a  photon  traveling
between atoms at a speed ‘c’  (vacuum light speed) encounters an atom, that atom absorbs
it  and  another  photon  of  the  same  wavelength  is  emitted  after  a  time  lag  ‘t ’.  In  the
classical  wave  interpretation,  the  scattered  photon  is  out  of  phase  with  the  incident
photon.  We  can  thus  consider  the  propagation  of  the  photon  through  the  crystal  is  a
composite  signal.  As  the  photon  propagates,  part  of  the  time  it  exists  in  the  atom
(technically, existing as an electron bound elastically to some atom), and part of the time
as  a  photon  propagating  with  the  undisturbed  low-level  light  velocity  ‘c’.  When  the
photon changes existence to being a bound electron, the velocity is ‘V’. From this, it can

22

be shown (ref. 41, an exercise in algebra and geometry) that the velocity of the composite
signal ‘vc’  (ignoring atom recoil, which is shown to be negligible) is:

vc = c  [1 + (Vt /l) (1 - V/c)] / [1 + (ct /l)  (1 - V/c)]

             (3.51)

If we set V=0, then vc = c  / (1 + ct /l) = c/n. Therefore, t /l = (n – 1)/c. Inserting this in the
above equations give:

vc =   [(c/n)  +  (1 – 1/n) V (1 - V/c)] /[1 -  (1 – 1/n)(V/c)] »
        
(to first order in V/c).

  c/n + (1 – 1/n2) V

             (3.52)

Again,  this  is  Fresnel’s  formula.  Thus  the  simplified  non-relativistic  atomic  model  of  the
propagation of light through matter explains the Fresnel formula to the first order in V/c
through  the  simple  introduction  of  a  scattering  delay  between  photon  absorption  and
subsequent  re-emission.  This  analysis  is  based  on  a  semi-classical  approach.  What  does
quantum theory say about this scattering process? The best theory we have to answer this
question is QED.

3.6

 PHOTON SCATTERING IN THE ACCELERATED VACUUM (** Optional)

Anyone who believes in the existence of virtual fermion particles in the quantum vacuum
that  carry  mass,  will  acknowledge  the  existence  of  a  coordinated  general  downward
acceleration  of  these  virtual  particles  near  any  large  gravitational  field.  In  EMQG
(Appendix A) gravitons from the real fermions on the earth exchange gravitons with the
virtual  fermions  of  the  vacuum  (which  carry  electric  charge),  causing  a  downward
acceleration.  The  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  (now  accelerated  by  a  large
mass) acts on light (and matter) in a similar manner as a stream of moving water acts on
light in the Fizeau effect. How does this work mathematically?

Again,  it  is  impossible  to  compute  the  interaction  of  an  accelerated  collection  of  virtual
particles of the quantum vacuum with light exactly. However, a simplified model can yield
useful  results.  We  will  proceed  using  the  semi-classical  model  proposed  by  Lorentz,
above. We have defined the raw light velocity ‘cr’  (EMQG, ref. 1) as the photon velocity
in  between  virtual  particle  scattering.  Recall  that  raw  light  velocity  is  the  shifting  of  the
photon  information  pattern  by  one  cell  at  every  clock  cycle  on  the  CA,  so  that  in
fundamental  units  it  is  an  absolute  constant.  Again,  we  assume  that  the  photon  delay
between absorption and subsequent re-emission by a virtual particle is ‘t ’, and the average
distance between virtual particle scattering is ‘l’. The scattered light velocity vc(t) is now a
function of time, because we assume that it is constantly varying as it moves downwards
towards  the  surface  in  the  same  direction  of  the  virtual  particles.  The  virtual  particles
move according to: a =gt, where g = GM/R2.

Therefore we can write the velocity of light after scattering with the accelerated quantum
vacuum:

23

vc(t) = cr  [1 + (gtt /l) (1 - gt/cr)] / [1 + (crt /l)  (1 - gt/cr)]

 (3.61)

If we set the acceleration to zero, or gt = 0, then vc(t) = cr  / (1 + crt /l) = cr/n. Therefore,
t /l = (n – 1)/cr. Inserting this in the above equation gives:

vc(t)  =   [(cr/n)  +  (1 – 1/n) gt (1 - gt/cr)] / [1 -  (1 – 1/n)(gt/cr)]  »
to first order in gt/cr. 

  cr/n  +  (1 – 1/n2) gt
 (3.62)

Since  the  average  distance  between  virtual  charged  particles  is  very  small,  the  photons
(which are always created at velocity cr) spend most of the time existing as some virtual
charged  particle  undergoing  downward  acceleration.  Because  the  electrically  charged
virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  are  falling  in  their  brief  existence,  the  photon
effectively takes on the same downward acceleration as the virtual vacuum particles (as an
average  over  macroscopic  distances).  In  other  words,  because  the  index  of  refraction  of
the quantum vacuum ‘n’  is so large (relative to no vacuum particles), and because c = cr/n
and we can write in equation 3.62:

vc(t) =  cr/n  +  (1 – 1/n2) gt = c + gt = c (1 + gt/c)  if n >>1.

 (3.63)

Similarly, for photons going against the flow (upwards): vc(t) = c (1 - gt/c) 

 (3.64)

This formula is used in EMQG for the variation of light velocity near a large gravitational
field,  and  leads  to  the  correct  amount  of  general  relativistic  space-time  curvature  taking
into account some additional assumptions as shown in Appendix A. It is this path Einstein
followed

4. 

NON-LOCALITY AND SUPERLUMINAL PHOTONIC TUNNELING

Is there any other evidence in physics for phenomena that potentially exhibit faster-than-
light propagation? In quantum mechanics there definitely exist such phenomena:

(1)  The  Quantum  Non-Locality  of  quantum  entangled  particles,  which  apparently

communicate each other’s quantum state faster-than-light.

(2)  Apparent  faster-than-light  tunneling  of  photons  through  a  potential  barrier,

which is classically too large for the photon to penetrate.

Both phenomena are well known and described in standard text books on quantum theory.
A  good  account  of  both  is  given  in  an  article  titled  “FASTER  THAN  LIGHT?”.  In
Scientific  American,  August  1993  by  R.  Chiao,  P.  Kwiat,  A.  Steinberg  (ref.  26).  Non-
locality is an effect where two particles (or more) are causally connected or entangled (in
other  words  where  the  two  particle’s  wave  functions  are  dependent  on  each  other),  can
influence  each  other  apparently  instantaneously  no  matter  how  far  apart  they  are.  A
famous example of entanglement is the famous Einstein EPR proposal of 1935 (ref. 10),

24

and subsequent experimental verification by Aspect (ref. 12). It was J.S. Bell (ref. 28) that
first  derived  a  set  of  inequalities  that  Nature  should  obey  if  locality  and  reality  were
obeyed,  and  in  which  are  violated  by  quantum  mechanics.    In  some  interpretations  of
quantum theory this appears to be contradiction of strict Einstein locality or causality, and
therefore provides evidence for faster-than-light signaling. However to our knowledge no
one  has  been  able  to  devise  a  method  of  sending  information  faster  than  light  from  one
location to another using quantum non-locality methods (excluding the claims by  Nimtz,
ref. 27.

Quantum  Tunneling  is  a  phenomenon  that  is  in  some  sense  related  to  non-locality.  In
photon  tunneling,  a  photon  has  a  finite  probability  of  moving  through  a  barrier  that  it
should  not  be  able  to  pass  through  according  to  classical  physics.  What  is  remarkable
about  tunneling  of  photons  (or  for  other  types  of  quantum  particles)  is  that  when  a
measurement  is  made  for  the  tunneling  velocity,  one  finds  that  it  is  greater  than  the
velocity of light in a vacuum. However some physicists maintain that it is not possible to
talk about the photon actually having a definite velocity while it passes through the barrier.
Indeed  the  act  of  assigning  a  definite  time  to  the  tunneling  process  has  also  been
questioned  (ref.  24).  These  arguments  appeal  to  the  probabilistic  nature  of  the  wave
packet  that  describes  the  photon.  The  problem  of  defining  the  tunneling  time  of  photon
penetration  through  a  barrier  has  a  long  history,  which  dates  back  to  the  1920’s,  when
Hund first proposed the quantum mechanical “barrier penetration”  phenomena. Quantum
tunneling  has  important  applications  in  electronics,  and  the  very  operation  of  the  tunnel
diode depends on the existence of the quantum tunneling phenomenon.

An excellent account of quantum tunneling of photons is given by R. Y. Chiao, P. Kwiat,
and A. Steinberg in the August 1993 (ref. 26) Scientific American magazine titled “Faster
than Light?”. These authors claim that their “Experiments in quantum optics show that
two distant events can influence each other faster than any signal could have traveled
between them.” They report that during several days of data collection (of more than one
million  photons  tunneling  through  their  barrier),  that  on  average  the  tunneling  photons
arrived  before  the  unimpeded  photons.  Their  results  imply  that  the  average  tunneling
velocity  for  the  photons  is  about  1.7  times  that  of  light  (ref.  25).  What  is  even  more
bizarre is that the ‘tunneling velocity’  (which is a questionable concept) does not depend
on the width of the barrier!

R. Chiao et al. provide an explanation for faster-than-light tunneling that is not based on
the concept of a tunneling velocity or a tunneling time. They point out that the photon’s
quantum mechanical wave function of the tunneling photon is greatly reduced in amplitude
in comparison to the unimpeded photon’s wave function. Recall that the amplitude of the
wave function at a point represents the probability of finding a photon at that point. They
point out that the center of the photon wave packet is the place of greatest probability of
detection  in  the  experiment.  They  claim  that  the  wave  front  of  the  tunneling  and
unimpeded photons move together at the same rate, but that the tunneling photons arrive
first  because  of  the  change  in  wave  shape.  They  illustrate  this  elegantly  with  racing
tortoises, where the two noses of the tortoises are locked in step, but the smaller one has a

25

narrower wave packet width and subsequently is detected first  (illustration on bottom of
page 55, ref. 26).

Other  experiments  by  G.  Nimitz  using  microwave  frequency  photons  instead  of  light,
demonstrate that the microwave ‘tunneling velocity’  is 4.7 times light speed. Furthermore
in  order  to  illustrate  that  tunneling  can  convey  information  faster-than-light,  they
modulated the microwave beam with the audio track of the 1st movement of Mozart’s 40th
symphony. They report that they were able to send this message through the barrier at 4.7
times light speed (ref. 27).

The proposed LVC experiments borrow much of the same techniques used by R. Chiao et.
al. to measure the increase in light velocity in quantum tunneling. The task is similar, that
is to compare the arrival times of photons from two different photon paths that started at
the same time, where the difference in arrival times is incredibly small and hard to detect.
The speed of light is so great at laboratory distances that conventional electronics is tens
of  thousands  of  times  too  slow  to  measure  the  small  differences  in  light  arrival  time.  To
solve  this  problem  they  used  twin  photon  interferometers  to  measure  the  required  time
delays, a technique that we will borrow for our proposed experiments.

5. 

THE PROPOSED CASIMIR LIGHT VELOCITY EXPERIMENTS

We  propose  experiments  to  look  for  the  Light  Velocity  Casimir  (LVC)  effect  and  to
measure  the  Casimir  vacuum  index  of  refraction.  Figure  1  shows  the  conceptual  block
diagram of the first experiment to observe the increase in light velocity. Figure 3 gives a
more  detailed  account,  which  we  will  describe  later.  Here  we  have  two  identical  light
paths  that  originated  from  a  common  light  source  such  as  a  laser,  where  one  light  path
travels straight through the vacuum unimpeded, and becomes our standard reference path
for the light velocity in the vacuum. The other light path travels between two transparent
electrically conducting, Casimir plates in a vacuum, which are closely spaced and have an
adjustable  plate  spacing  ‘d’.  When  the  laser  light  source  is  switched  on,  the  light  path
through  the  Casimir  plates  arrives  at  its  detector  first,  where  the  arrival  time  becomes
sooner with decreasing plate spacing.

NOTE: Light must  propagate  perpendicular through the  plates in the LVC experiment,
because  it  is  in  this  direction  that  vacuum  density  decreases.  If  light  travels  parallel
through the Casimir plates (which would offer a longer path to increase light velocity),
the  vacuum  density  and  light  velocity  along  this  direction  are  not  changed.  This
illustrates  that  the  vacuum  process  inside  the  Casimir  plates  is  a  dynamic  effect.  If  the
Casimir plates are visualized as being part of a rectangular enclosure and air is pumped
out  of  the  box,  the  velocity  of  light  would  increase  compared  to  the  velocity  of  light  in
air, no matter what direction light traveled in the box. If the two ends of the rectangular
box are removed, then the inside and outside air pressure would balance. This is not so
for the Casimir plates. Even though the two ends of the ‘Casimir’  box are removed, the
Casimir  plates  maintain  a  decreased  vacuum  density,  but  only  in  the  direction

26

perpendicular  to  the  plates.  This  pressure  change  is  maintained  dynamically  by  the
quantum vacuum process discussed in section 2.1.

We  claim  that  the  front  velocity  of  the  light  traveling  through  the  Casimir  plates  will
exceed the velocity of light in the ordinary vacuum, as defined in section 1.1. In order to
enhance the magnitude of the light velocity increase, it is desirable to increase the optical
path  length  for  the  laser  light  through  the  Casimir  plates.  This  can  be  done  by  optically
arranging  a  set  of  mirrors  to  direct  the  light  back  and  forth  several  times  through  the
Casimir  plates  (which  must  also  be  done  in  the  reference  path).  In  order  to  simplify  the
discussions,  this  arrangement  is  not  shown  in  any  of  the  diagrams,  and  the  method  used
depends on the detailed experimental arrangement chosen. The two beams are then routed
to  two  individual  detectors  (Figure  3).  The  detectors  electronic  outputs  are  fed  to  an
electronic instrument that can accurately measure time delays between the two outputs.

Although  we  have  been  unable  to  compute  the  value  of  the  light  velocity  increase,  we
expect it to be very small. We believe that using an ordinary laser beam (which contains
enormous  numbers  of  photons)  as  a  light  source  will  not  be  effective  in  measuring  the
LVC  effect.  Instead  we  borrow  some  techniques  from  quantum  optics  and  from  the
measurement of optical tunneling times to detect the LVC effect for single photons. The
time that it takes light to transverse the Casimir plate spacing (assuming the plates are not
there) with a 1m m spacing is 33 fs (33x10-15 seconds)! Therefore we expect that the time
to propagate through the plates to be smaller than this value. That means we would like to
have  perhaps  0.1  fs  resolution  in  time.  Currently  the  best  photon  detectors  only  have  a
picosecond-scale response time, which is not fast enough for this application. However a
device  called 
resolution, which is ideal for this experiment.

the  ‘Hong-Ou-Mandel  Interferometer’  has  femtosecond-scale 

time

Figure 3 shows a conceptual Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer-based setup that should be
capable of measuring the Casimir light velocity increase for individual photons! It is very
similar  to  the  experimental  arrangement  to  measure  the  quantum  tunneling  of  individual
photons through a barrier used by R. Chiao et al. (ref. 25 and 26). In order to make sure
both photons start traveling at the same time through the apparatus we suggest the use of
a  ‘Spontaneous  Parametric  Down-Conversion’  crystal,  which  absorbs  the  incoming
ultraviolet  photon  from  an  argon  laser  and  emits  two  new  photons  simultaneously,  and
which  are  strongly  correlated.  The  energies  of  the  two  photons  equal  the  energy  of  the
incoming  photon.  Furthermore  the  two  photons  are  quantum  mechanically  entangled,
which is beneficial to overcoming potential sources of errors in performing the experiment
(ref. 25). The two photons reflect off the two mirrors and travel through two equal length
paths and meet at the beam splitter. One path is the reference vacuum path, and the other
is the Casimir plate path, where the plates are originally removed to calibrate the optical
paths to null the interferometer (ref. 25).

The advantage of using the Hong-Ou-Mandel Interferometer is that it results in a narrow
null  in  the  coincidence  count  rate  as  a  function  of  the  relative  delay  between  the  two
photons,  a  destructive  interference  effect  that  was  first  observed  by  Hong,  Ou,  and

27

Mandel.  The  narrowness  of  the  coincidence  minimum  combined  with  a  good  signal  to
noise ratio should provide a measurement of the relative delay between the two photons to
a precision of – 0.2 fs (ref. 25).

There are four possible outcomes at the beam splitter: both photons might pass through,
both  might  be  reflected  from  the  beam  splitter,  both  might  go  off  to  one  side  (one
reflected, and one transmitted), or both may go off the other side. We are interested in the
first two cases, where the two photons reach different detectors that result in coincidence
detection. We adjust the optical lengths until coincidence detection disappears. This means
that  any  deviation  in  the  relative  velocities  of  the  two  path’s  results  will  become readily
apparent because of the narrowness of the interference null. The detectors chosen for the
tunneling experiment (ref. 25) are Geiger-mode silicon avalanche photo-diodes. Aslo, care
must be taken not to choose a Casimir plate spacing which nulls out the photon (multiples
of the photon frequency), since the Casimir plates are electrically conductive.

The Vacuum Casimir Index of Refraction given by nvac = c / cc (which should be slightly
less  than  one)  where  ‘cc’  is  the  light  velocity  between  the  Casimir  plates.  This  can  be
measured  in  the  experimental  arrangement  of  figure  3,  assuming  the  LVC  effect  is
observed. In order to calculate nvac one must measure cc. Let ‘h’  be the optical path length
of  the  reference  leg  of  the  interferometer.  Let  ‘d’  be  the  distance  between  the  Casimir
plates. Let ‘d t’  be the time a photon takes to traverse the Casimir plates. Let ‘D
t’  be the
time  a  photon  takes  to  traverse  the  plate  spacing,  with  no  plates  present.  The
interferometer  measures  the  time  tdiff  =  D
t  -  d t,  or  the  decrease  in  the  relative  time  of
propagation of the photon through Casimir plate distance ‘d’. In order to calculate nvac:

•  Determine the optical length ‘h’  through the reference leg of the interferometer, which

is also equal to the optical length of the Casimir plate leg of the interferometer.

•  Determine the time delay tdiff = D

t - d t , which is also the time difference between the

arrival of a photon first at detector 2 followed by the detection at detector 1.

•  Calculate D
• 

t = d/c, and then calculate d t = D

t - tdiff .

It follows that the light velocity inside the Casimir plates is given by:  cc = d / d t, which
should be slightly less than ‘c’  in the reference leg.
Finally we have the Vacuum Casimir Index of Refraction:   nvac = c / cc

• 

Figure 2 shows an alternate way to demonstrate the Light Velocity Casimir effect, based
on  the  classical  idea  of  light  refraction.  Conceptually  we  start  with  a  single  laser  light
source and direct the light at a shallow angle ‘t0‘  that is close to the perpendicular of the
two  transparent,  electrically  conducting  Casimir  plates  (see  the  bubble  in  figure  2).  This
must  be  so,  because  the  refraction  only  happens  in  the  nearly  perpendicular  direction  of
the Casimir plates (see the note at the beginning of section 5).

The light deflects at the first plate by an angle t1, such that nvac = sin(t0) / sin(t1). When the
light exits the second plate it returns to the original direction because it goes to the normal
vacuum state which is an increase in density. The end result is that the light beam is still in
line  with  the  incoming  beam,  but  slightly  shifted  to  the  right.  In  these  discussions  we

28

ignore  any  refraction  through  the  transparent  plate  material,  which  must  be  taken  into
account when performing the actual experiment. Because the spacing between the plates is
quite small, the light bending effect would be very hard to detect with only a two Casimir
plate experiment.

In  order  to  enhance  the  bending  effect  it  is  desirable  to  have  a  series  of  transparent  and
conductive Casimir plates, such that the spacing between the subsequent plates decreases
with  distance.  Figure  2  shows  an  example  arrangement  of  four  such  Casimir  plates  for
illustration  purposes.  With  this  arrangement  the  exit  angle  of  the  light  is  permanently
different from the original angle, because the vacuum density between the plates varies in
different steps between each new pair of plates. This means that over a large distance the
angle can be easily measured. In practice the resulting angle is going to be extremely small,
because of the very slight differences in energy-density per pair of plates.

However  a  small  angle  can  translate  to  a  large  shift  or  deflection  in  the  total  light  path,
when the light is allowed to travel over a large distance in normal air. For example if the
difference in angle of the incoming and outgoing light paths is D
 = 0.001 degrees (which
is only 3.6 seconds of arc), at a distance of h=100 meters the difference in position of the
expected light beam is given by: h tan(D
q ) = 1.7 millimeters, which is a distance that can
be easily measured.

6. 

CONCLUSIONS

1.  We believe that the velocity of light (specifically the front velocity) propagating in
vacuum inside (and perpendicular) two closely spaced, electrically conducting and
transparent plates called the Casimir plates, will increase inside the plates compared to
the light velocity in the normal vacuum, measured in the laboratory frame. This
conclusion should be subjected to future experimental verification. We have proposed
two such experiments; an interferometer, which is designed to resolve the difference in
arrival time of individual photons, and another experiment to measure the refraction of
light propagating at a shallow angle (nearly perpendicular) through a series of Casimir
plates with gradually decreasing plate separation.

2.  We believe that there must exist a ‘Vacuum Casimir Index of Refraction’  called ‘nvac’

for light traveling from outside, and through the Casimir plates in vacuum. The
Casimir vacuum index of refraction is defined as the ratio of the velocity of light in
normal vacuum conditions divided by the light velocity measured propagating inside
the Casimir plates in vacuum ‘cc‘. The vacuum Casimir index of refraction ‘nvac’  is thus
defined as: nvac = c / cc , which should be slightly less than one. This should manifest
itself as a slight change in direction of the light beam through the Casimir plates in
accordance with Snell’s law of refraction: n = sin q 0 / sin q 1.

APPENDIX A:

BRIEF REVIEW OF EMQG

34

This appendix gives a very brief review of Electromagnetic Quantum Gravity (EMQG)
and it’s connection to the quantum vacuum and the Casimir Light Velocity effect. The full
paper can be found in reference A1. This review is intended to briefly summarize the
essential ideas of EMQG  and the central role that the quantum vacuum plays in EMQG.

We  have  developed  a  new  approach  to  the  unification  of  quantum  theory  with  general
relativity referred to as Electro-Magnetic Quantum Gravity or EMQG (ref. 1). Figure A1
at  the  end  of  the  appendix  illustrates  the  relationship  between  EMQG  and  the  rest  of
physical  theory.  EMQG  has  its  origins  in  Cellular  Automata  (CA)  theory  (ref.  2,4,9  and
34), and is also based on the new theory of inertia that has been proposed by R. Haisch, A.
Rueda,  and  H.  Puthoff  (ref.  5)  known  here  as  the  HRP  Inertia  theory.  These  authors
suggest that inertia is due to the strictly local force interactions of charged matter particles
with their immediate background virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. They found that
inertia  is  caused  by  the  magnetic  component  of  the  Lorentz  force,  which  arises  between
what  the  author’s  call  the  charged  ‘parton’  particles  in  an  accelerated  reference  frame
interacting  with  the  background  quantum  vacuum  virtual  particles.  The  sum  of  all  these
tiny forces in this process is the source of the resistance force opposing accelerated motion
in  Newton’s  F=MA.  We  have  found  it  necessary  to  make  a  small  modification  of  HRP
Inertia theory as a result of our investigation of the principle of equivalence. The modified
version of HRP inertia is called “Quantum Inertia”  (or QI). In EMQG, a new elementary
particle is required to fully understand inertia, gravitation, and the principle of equivalence
(described  in  the  next  section).  This  theory  also  resolves  the  long  outstanding  problems
and  paradoxes  of  accelerated  motion  introduced  by  Mach’s  principle,  by  suggesting  that
the  vacuum  particles  themselves  serve  as  Mach’s  universal  reference  frame  (for
acceleration only), without violating the principle of relativity of constant velocity motion.
In other words, our universe offers no observable reference frame to gauge inertial frames,
because  the  quantum  vacuum  offers  no  means  to  determine  absolute  constant  velocity
motion. However for accelerated motion, the quantum vacuum plays a very important role
by  offering  a  resistance  to  acceleration,  which  results  in  an  inertial  force  opposing  the
acceleration  of  the  mass.  Thus  the  very  existence  of  inertial  force  reveals  the  absolute
value  of  the  acceleration  with  respect  to  the  net  statistical  average  acceleration  of  the
virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. Reference 14 offers an excellent introduction to
the motion of matter in the quantum vacuum, and on the history of the discovery of the
virtual particles of the quantum vacuum.

(A-1) EMQG and the Quantum Theory of Inertia

EMQG  theory  presents  a  unified  approach  to  Inertia,  Gravity,  the  Principle  of
Equivalence,  space-time  Curvature,  Gravitational  Waves,  and  Mach’s  Principle.  These
apparently different phenomena are the common results of the quantum interactions of the
real  (charged)  matter  particles  (of  a  mass)  with  the  surrounding  virtual  particles  of  the
quantum  vacuum  through  the  exchange  of  two  force  particles:  the  photon  and  the
graviton. Furthermore, the problem of the cosmological constant is solved automatically in
the  framework  of  EMQG.  This  new  approach  to  quantum  gravity  is  definitely  non-
geometric  on  the  tiniest  of  distance  scales  (Plank  Scales  of  distance  and  time).  This  is

35

because  the  large  scale  relativistic  4D  space-time  curvature  is  caused  purely  by  the
accelerated state of virtual particles of the quantum vacuum with respect to a mass, and
their  discrete  interactions  with  real  matter  particles  of  a  mass  through  the  particle  force
exchange  process.  Because  of  this  departure  from  a  universe  with  fundamentally  curved
space-time,  EMQG  is  a  complete  change  in  paradigm  over  conventional  gravitational
physics. This paper should be considered as a framework, or outline of a new approach to
gravitational physics that will hopefully lead to a full theory of quantum gravity.

We  modified  the  HRP  theory  of  Inertia  (ref.  5)  based  on  a  detailed  examination  of  the
principle of equivalence. In EMQG, the modified version of inertia is known as “Quantum
Inertia”,  or  QI.  In  EMQG,  a  new  elementary  particle  is  required  to  fully  understand
inertia,  gravitation,  and  the  principle  of  equivalence.  All  matter,  including  electrons  and
quarks, must be made of nature’s  most  fundamental  mass  unit  or  particle,  which  we  call
the  ‘masseon’  particle.  These  particles  contain  one  fixed,  fundamental  ‘quanta’  of  both
inertial and gravitational mass. The masseons also carry one basic, smallest unit or quanta
of  electrical  charge  as  well,  of  which  they  can  be  either  positive  or  negative.  Masseons
exist  in  the  particle  or  in  the  anti-particle  form  (called  anti-masseon),  that  can  appear  at
random in the vacuum as virtual masseon/anti-masseon particle pairs of opposite electric
charge and opposite ‘mass charge’. The earth consists of ordinary masseons (with no anti-
masseons),  of  which  there  are  equal  numbers  of  positive  and  negative  electric  charge
varieties. In HRP Inertia theory, the electrically charged ‘parton’  particles  (that  make  up
an  inertial  mass  in  an  accelerated  reference  frame)  interact  with  the  background  vacuum
electromagnetic  zero-point-field  (or  virtual  photons)  creating  a  resistance  to  acceleration
called  inertia.  We  have  modified  this  slightly  by  postulating  that  the  real  masseons  (that
make  up  an  accelerating  mass)  interacts  with  the  surrounding,  virtual  masseons  of  the
quantum  vacuum,  electromagnetically  (although  the  details  of  this  process  are  still  not
fully  understood).  The  properties  of  the  masseon  particle  and  gravitons  are  developed
later.

(A-2) EMQG and the Quantum Origin of Newton’s Laws of Motion

We are now in a position to understand the quantum nature of Newton’s classical laws of
motion. According to the standard textbooks of physics, Newton’s three laws of laws of
motion are:

An object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will continue in motion with a
constant velocity unless it experiences a net external force.
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on it and
inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically: S F = ma, where F and a are vectors.

If two bodies interact, the force exerted on body 1 by body 2 is equal to and opposite the
force exerted on body 2 by body 1. Mathematically: F12 = -F21.

Newton’s  first  law  explains  what  happens  to  a  mass  when  the  resultant  of  all  external
forces on it is zero. Newton’s second law explains what happens to a mass when there is a

36

nonzero resultant force acting on it. Newton’s third law tells us that forces always come in
pairs. In other words, a single isolated force cannot exist. The force that body 1 exerts on
body 2 is called the action force, and the force of body 2 on body 1 is called the reaction
force.

In the framework of EMQG theory, Newton’s first two laws are the direct consequence of
the  (electromagnetic)  force  interaction  of  the  (charged)  elementary  particles  of  the  mass
interacting with the (charged) virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. Newton’s third law
of motion is the direct consequence of the fact that all forces are the end result of a boson
particle exchange process.

(A-3) NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF MOTION:

In  EMQG,  the  first  law  is  a  trivial  result,  which  follows  directly  from  the  quantum
principle  of  inertia  (postulate  #3,  appendix  A-11).  First  a  mass  is  at  relative  rest  with
respect to an observer in deep space. If no external forces act on the mass, the (charged)
elementary  particles  that  make  up  the  mass  maintain  a  net  acceleration  of  zero  with
respect  to  the  (charged)  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  through  the
electromagnetic force exchange process. This means that no change in velocity is possible
(zero  acceleration)  and  the  mass  remains  at  rest.  Secondly,  a  mass  has  some  given
constant  velocity  with  respect  to  an  observer  in  deep  space.  If  no  external  forces  act  on
the  mass,  the  (charged)  elementary  particles  that  make  up  the  mass  also  maintain  a  net
acceleration of zero with respect to the (charged) virtual particles of the quantum vacuum
through  the  electromagnetic  force  exchange  process.  Again,  no  change  in  velocity  is
possible (zero acceleration) and the mass remains at the same constant velocity.

(A-4) NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION:

In EMQG, the second law is the quantum theory of inertia discussed above. Basically the
state of relative acceleration of the charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum with
respect to the charged particles of the mass is what is responsible for the inertial force. By
this we mean that it is the tiny (electromagnetic) force contributed by each mass particle
undergoing  an  acceleration  ‘A’,  with  respect  to  the  net  statistical  average  of  the  virtual
particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum,  that  results  in  the  property  of  inertia  possessed  by  all
masses. The sum of all these tiny (electromagnetic) forces contributed from each charged
particle of the mass (from the vacuum)  is  the  source  of  the  total  inertial  resistance  force
opposing accelerated motion in Newton’s F=MA. Therefore, inertial mass ‘M’  of a mass
simply represents the total resistance to acceleration of all the mass particles.

(A-5) NEWTON’S THIRD LAW OF MOTION:

According  to  the  boson  force  particle  exchange  paradigm  (originated  from  QED)  all
forces  (including  gravity,  as  we  shall  see)  result  from  particle  exchanges.  Therefore,  the
force that body 1 exerts on body 2 (called the action force), is the result of the emission of

37

force  exchange  particles  from  (the  charged  particles  that  make  up)  body  1,  which  are
readily absorbed by (the charged particles that make up) body 2, resulting in a force acting
on body 2. Similarly, the force of body 2 on body 1 (called the reaction force), is the result
of  the  absorption  of  force  exchange  particles  that  are  originating  from  (the  charged
particles that make up) body 2, and received by (the charged particles that make up) body
1, resulting in a force acting on body 1. An important property of charge is the ability to
readily  emit  and  absorb  boson  force  exchange  particles.  Therefore,  body  1  is  both  an
emitter and an absorber of the force exchange particles. Similarly, body 2 is also both an
emitter  and  an  absorber  of  the  force  exchange  particles.  This  is  the  reason  that  there  is
both an action and reaction force. For example, the contact forces (the mechanical forces
that  Newton  was  thinking  of  when  he  formulated  this  law)  that  results  from  a  person
pushing on a mass (and the reaction force from the mass pushing on the person) is really
the  exchange  of  photon  particles  from  the  charged  electrons  bound  to  the  atoms  of  the
person’s hand and the charged electrons bound to the atoms of the mass on the quantum
level.  Therefore,  on  the  quantum  level  there  is  really  is  no  contact  here.  The  hand  gets
very close to the mass, but does not actually touch. The electrons in one’s hand exchange
photons with the electrons in the mass. The force exchange process works both directions
in  equal  numbers,  because  all  the  electrons  in  the  hand  and  in  the  mass  are  electrically
charged  and  therefore  the  exchange  process  gives  forces  that  are  equal  and  opposite  in
both directions.

(A-6) Introduction to the Principle of Equivalence and EMQG

Are  virtual  particle  force  exchange  processes  originating  from  the  quantum  vacuum  also
present  for  gravitational  mass?  The  answer  turns  out  to  be  a  resounding  yes!  As  we
suggested,  there  is  some  evidence  of  the  interplay  between  the  virtual  particles  of  the
quantum  vacuum  and  gravitational  phenomena.  In  order  to  see  how  this  impacts  our
understanding  of  the  nature  of  gravitational  mass,  we  found  it  necessary  to  perform  a
thorough  investigation  of  Einstein’s  Principle  of  Equivalence  of  inertial  and  gravitational
mass in general relativity under the guidance of the new theory of quantum inertia.

We  have  uncovered  some  theoretical  evidence  that  the  SEP  may  not  hold  for  certain
experiments. There are two basic theoretical problems with the SEP in regard to quantum
gravity.  First,  if  gravitons  (the  proposed  force  exchange  particle)  can  be  detected  with
some new form of a sensitive graviton detector, we would be able to distinguish between
an accelerated reference frame and a gravitational frame with this detector. This is because
accelerated  frames  would  have  virtually  no  graviton  particles  present,  whereas  a  large
gravitational  field  like  the  earth  has  enormous  numbers  of  graviton  particles  associated
with  it.  Secondly,  theoretical  considerations  from  several  authors  regarding  the  emission
of  electromagnetic  waves  from  a  uniformly  accelerated  charge,  and  the  lack  of  radiation
from  the  same  charge  subjected  to  a  static  gravitational  field  leads  us  to  question  the
validity of the SEP for charged particles radiating electromagnetically.

How  does  the  WEP  hold  out  in  EMQG?  The  WEP  has  been  tested  to  a  phenomenal
accuracy (ref 24.) in recent times. Yet in our current understanding of the WEP, we can

38

only specify the accuracy as to which the two different mass values (or types) have been
shown experimentally to be equal inside an inertial or gravitational field. There exists no
physical or mathematical proof that the WEP is precisely true. It is still only a postulate of
general  relativity.  We  have  applied  the  recent  work  on  quantum  inertia  (ref.  5)  to  the
investigation of the weak principle of equivalence, and have found theoretical reasons to
believe  that  the  WEP  is  not  precisely  correct  when  measured  in  extremely  accurate
experiments.  Imagine  an  experiment  with  two  masses;  one  mass  M1  being  very  large  in
value,  and  the  other  mass  M2  is  very  small  (M1  >>  M2).  These  two  masses  are  dropped
simultaneously in a uniform gravitational field of 1g from a height ‘h’, and the same pair of
masses  are  also  dropped  inside  a  rocket  accelerating  at  1g,  at  the  same  height  ‘h’.  We
predict that there should be a minute deviation in arrival times on the surface of the earth
(only) for the two masses, with the heavier mass arriving just slightly ahead of the smaller
mass. This is due to a small deviation in the magnitude of the force of gravity on the mass
pair (in favor of M1) on the order of  (N1-N2)i * d , where (N1-N2) is the difference in the
low level mass specified in terms of the difference in the number of masseon particles in
the two masses (defined latter) times the single masseon mass ‘i’, and d  is the ratio of the
gravitational to electromagnetic forces for a single (charged) masseon. This experiment is
very difficult to perform on the earth, because d  is extremely small (» 10-40), and D N = (N1-
N2) cannot in practice be made sufficiently large in order to produce a measurable effect.
However, inside the accelerated rocket, the arrival times are exactly identical for the same
pair of masses. This, of course, violates the principle of equivalence, since the motion of
the  masses  in  the  inertial  frame  is  slightly  different  then  in  the  gravitational  frame.  This
imbalance is minute because of the dominance of the strong electromagnetic force, which
is also acting on the masseons of the two masses from the virtual particles of the quantum
vacuum. This acts to stabilize the fall rate, giving us nearly perfect equivalence.

This  conclusion  is  based  on  the  discovery  that  the  weak  principle  of  equivalence  results
from lower level physical processes. Mass equivalence arises from the equivalence of the
force  generated  between  the  net  statistical  average  acceleration  vectors  of  the  charged
matter particles inside a mass with respect to the immediate surrounding quantum vacuum
virtual  particles  inside  an  accelerating  rocket.  This  is  almost  exactly  the  same  physical
force  occurring  between  the  stationary  (charged)  matter  particles  and  the  immediate
surrounding accelerating virtual particles of the same mass near the earth. It turns out that
equivalence  is  not  perfect  in  the  presence  of  a  large  gravitational  field  like  the  earth.
Equivalence breaks down due to an extremely minute force imbalance in favor of a larger
mass dropped simultaneously with respect to a smaller mass. This force imbalance can be
traced to the pure graviton exchange force component occurring in the gravitational field
that is not present in the case of the identically dropped masses in an accelerated rocket.
This imbalance contributes a minute amount of extra force for the larger mass compared
to  the  smaller  mass  (due  to  many  more  gravitons  exchanged  between  the  larger  mass  as
compared to the smaller mass), which might be detected in highly accurate measurements.
In the case of the rocket, the equivalence of two different falling masses is perfect, since it
is  the  floor  of  the  rocket  that  accelerates  up  to  meet  the  two  masses  simultaneously.  Of
course, the breakdown of the WEP also means the downfall of the SEP.

In  EMQG,  the  gravitational  interactions  involve  the  same  electromagnetic  force
interaction  as  found  in  inertia  based  on  our  QI  theory.  We  also  found  that  the  weak
principle of equivalence itself is a physical phenomenon originating from the hidden lower
level  quantum  processes  involving  the  quantum  vacuum  particles,  graviton  exchange
particles, and photon exchange particles. In other words, gravitation is purely a quantum
force  particle  exchange  process,  and  is  not  based  on  low  level  fundamental  4D  curved
space-time  geometry  of  the  universe  as  believed  in  general  relativity.  The  perceived  4D
curvature  is  a  manifestation  of  the  dynamic  state  of  the  falling  virtual  particles  of  the
quantum  vacuum  in  accelerated  frames,  and  gravitational  frames.  The  only  difference
between the inertial and gravitation force is that gravity also involves graviton exchanges
(between  the  earth  and  the  quantum  vacuum  virtual  particles,  which  become  accelerated
downwards),  whereas  inertia  does  not.  Gravitons  have  been  proposed  in  the  past  as  the
exchange particle for gravitational interactions in a quantum field theory of gravity without
much success. The reason for the lack of success is that graviton exchange is not the only
exchange process occurring in large-scale gravitational interactions; photon exchanges are
also  involved!  It  turns  out  that  not  only  are  there  both  graviton  and  photon  exchange
processes occurring simultaneously in large scale gravitational interactions such as on the
earth, but that both exchange particles are almost identical in their fundamental nature (Of
course, the strength of the two forces differs greatly).

The equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass is ultimately traced down to the reversal
of all the relative acceleration vectors of the charged particles of the accelerated mass with
respect to the (net statistical) average acceleration of the quantum vacuum particles, that
occurs  when  changing  from  inertial  to  gravitational  frames.  The  inertial  mass  ‘M’  of  an
object with acceleration ‘a’  (in a rocket traveling in deep space, away from gravitational
fields) results from the sum of all the tiny forces of the charged elementary particles that
make up that mass with respect to the immediate quantum vacuum particles. This inertial
force  is  in  the  opposite  direction  to  the  motion  of  the  rocket.  The  (charged  masseon)
particles building up the mass in the rocket will have a net statistical average acceleration
‘a’  with respect to the local (charged masseon) virtual particles of the immediate quantum
vacuum.  A  stationary  gravitational  mass  resting  on  the  earth’s  surface  has  this  same
quantum process occurring as for the accelerated mass, but with the acceleration vectors
reversed. What we mean by this is that under gravity, it is now the virtual particles of the
quantum vacuum that carries the net statistical average acceleration ‘A’  downward.  This
downward  virtual  particle  acceleration  is  caused  by  the  graviton  exchanges  between  the
earth and the mass, where the mass is not accelerated with respect to the center of mass of
the  earth.  (Note:  On  an  individual  basis,  the  velocity  vectors  of  these  quantum  vacuum
particles  actually  point  in  all  directions,  and  also  have  random  amplitudes.  Furthermore,
random  accelerations  occur  due  to  force  interactions  between  the  virtual  particles
themselves. This is why we refer to the statistical nature of the acceleration.) We now see
that the gravitational force of a stationary mass is also the same sum of the tiny forces that
originate for a mass undergoing accelerated motion in a gravitational field from the virtual
particles of the quantum vacuum according to Newton’s law  ‘F  =  MA’.  In  other  words,
the  same  inertial  force  F=MA  is  also  found  hidden  inside  gravitational  interactions  of

40

masses! Mathematically, this fact can be seen in Newton’s laws of inertia and in Newton’s
gravitational force law by slightly rearranging the formulas as follows:

Fi  = Mi (Ai)   ...  the inertial force Fi opposes the acceleration Ai of mass Mi in the rocket,
caused by the sum of the tiny forces from the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum.

Fg= Mg (Ag) = Mg (GMe/r2) ... the gravitational force Fg is the result of a kind of an inertial
force given by ‘Mg Ag’  where Ag  = GMe/r2 is now due to the sum of the tiny forces from
the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum (now accelerating downwards).

Since Fi=Fg, and since the acceleration of gravity is chosen to be the same as the inertial
acceleration, where the virtual particles now have: Ag = Ai = GMe/r2 , therefore Mi=Mg ,
or the inertia mass is equal to the gravitational mass (Me is the mass of the earth). Here,
Newton’s  law  of  gravity  is  rearranged  slightly  to  emphasis  it’s  form  as  a  kind  of  an
‘inertial  force’  of  the  form  F=MA,  where  the  acceleration  (GMe/r2)  is  now  the  net
statistical average downward acceleration of the quantum vacuum virtual particles near the
vicinity of the earth.

This derivation is not complete, unless we can provide a clear explanation as to why Fi=Fg
,  which  we  know  to  be  true  from  experimental  observation.  In  EMQG,  both  of  these
forces  are  understood  to  arise  from  an  almost  identical  quantum  vacuum  process!  For
accelerated masses, inertia is the force Fi caused by the sum of all the tiny electromagnetic
forces from each of the accelerated charged particles inside the mass; with respect to the
non-accelerating surrounding virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. Under the influence
of a gravitational field, the same force Fg exists as it does in inertia, but now the quantum
vacuum  particles  are  the  ones  undergoing  the  same  acceleration  Ai  (through  graviton
exchanges with the earth); the charged particles of the mass are stationary with respect to
earth’s  center.  The  same  force  arises,  but  the  arrows  of  the  acceleration  vectors  are
reversed. To elaborate on this, imagine that you are in the reference frame of a stationary
mass resting on the surface with respect to earth’s center. An average charged particle of
this  mass  ‘sees’ 
the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  in  the  same  state  of
acceleration, as does an average charged particle of an identical mass sitting on the floor
of an accelerated rocket (1 g). In other words, the background quantum vacuum ‘looks’
exactly the same from both points of view (neglecting the very small imbalance caused by
a  very  large  number  of  gravitons  interacting  with  the  mass  directly  under  gravity,  this
imbalance is swamped by the strength of the electromagnetic forces existing).

These equations and methodology illustrate equivalence in a special case: that is between
an  accelerated  mass  Mi  and  the  same  stationary  gravitational  mass  Mg.  In  EMQG,  the
weak  equivalence  principle  of  gravitational  and  inertial  frames  holds  for  many  other
scenarios such as for free falling masses, for masses that have considerable self gravity and
energy  (like  the  earth),  for  elementary  particles,  and  for  the  propagation  of  light.
However,  equivalence  is  not  perfect,  and  in  some  situations  (for  example,  antimatter
discussed in section 7.1) it simply does not hold at all!

41

An  astute  observer  may  question  why  all  the  virtual  particles  (electrons,  quarks,  etc.,  all
having  different  masses)  are  accelerating  downwards  on  the  earth  with  the  same
acceleration.  This  definitely  would  be  the  case  from  the  perspective  of  a  mass  being
accelerated  by  a  rocket  (where  the  observer  is  accelerating).  Since  the  masses  of  the
different  types  of  virtual  particles  are  all  different  according  to  the  standard  model  of
particle physics, why are they all falling at the same rate? Since we are trying to derive the
equivalence principle, we cannot invoke this principle to state that all virtual particles must
be  accelerating  downward  at  the  same  rate.  It  turns  out  that  the  all  quantum  vacuum
virtual particles are accelerating at the same rate because all particles with mass (virtual or
not)  are  composed  of  combinations  of  a  new  fundamental  “masseon”  particle,  which
carries  just  one  fixed  quanta  of  mass.  Therefore,  all  the  elementary  virtual  masseon
particles of the quantum vacuum are accelerated by the same amount. These masseons can
bind  together  to  form  the  familiar  particles  of  the  standard  model,  like  virtual  electrons,
virtual  positrons,  virtual  quarks,  etc.  Recalling  that  the  masseon  also  carries  electrical
charge, we see that all the constituent masseons of the quantum vacuum particles fall to
earth at same rate through the electromagnetic interaction (or photon exchange) process,
no  matter  how  the  virtual  masseons  combine  to  give  the  familiar  virtual  particles.  This
process works like a microscopic principle of equivalence for falling virtual particles, with
the same action occurring for virtual particles as for large falling masses.

The properties of the masseon particle is elaborated in section 7 (the masseon may be the
unification particle sought out by physicist, in which case it will have other properties to
do  with  the  other  forces  of  nature).  For  now,  note  that  the  masseon  also  carries  the
fundamental unit of electric charge as well. This fundamental unit of electric charge turns
out to be the source of inertia for all matter according to Quantum Inertia. By postulating
the  existence  of  the  masseon  particle  (which  is  the  fundamental  unit  of  ‘mass  charge’  as
well as ‘electrical charge’) all the quantum vacuum virtual particles accelerate at the same
rate  with  respect  to  an  observer  on  the  surface  of  the  earth.  We  have  postulated  the
existence  of  a  fundamental  “low  level  gravitational  mass  charge”  of  a  particle,  which
results  from  the  graviton  particle  exchange  process  similar  to  the  process  found  for
electrical charges. This ‘mass charge’  is  not  affected  when  a  particle  achieves  relativistic
velocities,  so  we  can  state  that  ‘low  level  mass  charge’  is  an  absolute  constant.  For
particles  accelerated  to  relativistic  speeds,  a  high  relative  velocity  between  the  source  of
the force and the receiving mass affects the ordinary measurable inertial mass, as we have
seen (in accordance to Einstein’s mass-velocity formula).

(A-7) Summary of the Basic Mass Definitions in EMQG

EMQG proposes three different mass definitions for an object:

(1) INERTIAL MASS is the measurable mass defined in Newton’s force law F=MA. This
is  considered  as  the  absolute  mass  in  EMQG,  because  it  results  from  force  produced  by
the  relative  (statistical  average)  acceleration  of  the  charged  virtual  particles  of  the
quantum vacuum with respect to the charged particles that make up the inertial mass. The

42

virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  become  Newton’s  absolute  reference  frame.  In
special relativity this mass is equivalent to the rest mass.

(2) GRAVITATIONAL MASS is the measurable mass involved in the gravitational force
as defined in Newton’s law F=GM1M2/R2. This is what is measured on a weighing scale.
This is also considered as absolute mass, and is almost exactly the same as inertial mass.

(3) LOW LEVEL GRAVITATIONAL ‘MASS CHARGE’, which is the origin of the pure
gravitational  force,  is  defined  as  the  force  that  results  through  the  exchange  of  graviton
particles  between  two  (or  more)  quantum  particles.  This  type  of  mass  analogous  to
‘electrical  charge’,  where  photon  particles  are  exchanged  between  electrically  charged
particles. Note: This force is very hard to measure because it is masked by the background
quantum  vacuum  electromagnetic  force  interactions,  which  dominates  over  the  graviton
force processes.

These three forms of mass are not necessarily equal! We have seen that the inertial mass is
almost exactly the same as gravitational mass, but not perfectly equal. All quantum mass
particles  (fermions)  have  all  three  mass  types  defined  above.  Note  that  bosons  (only
photons and gravitons are considered here) have only the first two mass types. This means
that  photons  and  gravitons  transfer  momentum,  and  do  react  to  the  presence  of  inertial
frames and to gravitational fields, but they do not emit or absorb gravitons. Gravitational
fields effect photons, and this is linked to the concept of space-time curvature, described in
detail  later  (section  9).  It  is  important  to  realize  that  gravitational  fields  deflect  photons
(and  gravitons),  but  not  by  force  particle  exchanges  directly.  Instead,  it  is  due  to  a
scattering process (described later).

To  summarize,  both  the  photon  and  the  graviton  do  not  carry  low  level  ‘mass  charge’,
even  though  they  both  carry  inertial  and  gravitational  mass.  The  graviton  exchange
particle, although responsible for a major part of the gravitational mass process, does not
itself carry the property of ‘mass charge’. Contrast this with conventional physics, where
the photon and the graviton both carry a non-zero mass given by M=E/C2. According to
this reasoning, the photon and the graviton both carry mass (since they carry energy), and
therefore  both  must  have  ‘mass  charge’  and  exchange  gravitons.  In  other  words,  the
graviton  particle  not  only  participates  in  the  exchange  process,  it  also  undergoes  further
exchanges while it is being exchanged! This is the source of great difficulty for canonical
quantum gravity theories, and causes all sorts of mathematical renormalization problems in
the  corresponding  quantum  field  theory.  Furthermore,  in  gravitational  force  interactions
with  photons,  the  strength  of  the  force  (which  depends  on  the  number  of  gravitons
exchanged with photon) varies with the energy that the photon carries! In modern physics,
we do not distinguish between inertial, gravitational, or low level ‘mass charge’. They are
assumed  to  be  equivalent,  and  given  a  generic  name  ‘mass’.  In  EMQG,  the  photon  and
graviton  carry  measurable  inertial  and  gravitational  mass,  but  neither  particle  carries  the
‘low level mass charge’, and therefore do not participate in graviton exchanges.

43

We  must  emphasize  that  gravitons  do  not  interact  with  each  other  through  force
exchanges in EMQG, just as photons do not interact with each other with force exchanges
in  QED.  Imagine  if  gravitons  did  interact  with  other  gravitons.  One  might  ask  how  it  is
possible for a graviton particle (that always moves at the speed of light) to emit graviton
particles  that  are  also  moving  at  the  speed  of  light.  For  one  thing,  this  violates  the
principles of special relativity theory. Imagine two gravitons moving in the same direction
at the speed of light, which are separated by a distance d, with the leading graviton called
‘A’  and the lagging graviton called ‘B’. How can graviton ‘B’  emit another graviton (also
moving at the speed of light) that becomes absorbed by graviton ‘A’  moving at the speed
of light? As we have seen, these difficulties are resolved by realizing that there are actually
three  different  types  of  mass.  There  is  measurable  inertial  mass  and  measurable
gravitational mass, and low level ‘mass charge’  that cannot be directly measured. Inertial
and  gravitational  masses  have  already  been  discussed  and  arise  from  different  physical
circumstances,  but  in  most  cases  give  identical  results.  However,  the  ‘low  level  mass
charge’  of a particle is defined simply as the force existing between two identical particles
due  to  the  exchange  of  graviton  particles  only,  which  are  the  vector  bosons  of  the
gravitational  force.  Low  level  mass  charge  is  not  directly  measurable,  because  of  the
complications due to the electromagnetic forces that are present simultaneously from the
virtual particles.

It  would  be  interesting  to  speculate  what  the  universe  might  be  like  if  there  were  no
quantum  vacuum  virtual  particles  present.  Bearing  in  mind  that  the  graviton  exchange
process  is  almost  identical  to  the  photon  exchange  process,  and  bearing  in  mind  the
complete  absence  of  the  electromagnetic  component  in  gravitational  interactions,  the
universe would be a very strange place indeed. We would find that large masses would fall
faster than smaller masses, just as a large positive electric charge would ‘fall’  faster than a
small positive charge towards a very large negative charge. There would be no inertia as
we know it, and basically no force would be required to accelerate or stop a large mass.

(A-8) The Quantum Field Theory of the Masseon and Graviton Particles

EMQG  addresses  gravitational  force,  inertia,  and  electromagnetic  forces  only,  and  the
weak and strong nuclear forces are excluded from consideration. EMQG is based on the
idea  that  all  elementary  matter  particles  must  get  their  quantum  mass  numbers  from
combinations  of  just  one  fundamental  matter  (and  corresponding  anti-matter  particle),
which has just one fixed unit or quanta of mass that we call the ‘masseon’  particle.  This
fundamental  particle  generates  a  fixed  flux  of  gravitons  that  are  exchanged  during
gravitational interactions. The exchange process is not affected by the state of motion of
the  masseon  (as  you  might  expect  from  the  special  relativistic  variation  of  mass  with
velocity). We also purpose that nature does not have two completely different long-range
forces, for example gravity and electromagnetism. Instead we believe that there exists an
almost  perfect  symmetry  between  the  two  forces,  which  is  hidden  from  view  because  of
the mixing of these two forces in all measurable gravitational interactions. In EMQG the
graviton and photon exchange process are found to be essentially the same, except for the
strength  of  the  force  coupling  (and  a  minor  difference  in  the  treatment  of  positive  and

44

negative masses discussed later). EMQG treats graviton exchanges by the same successful
methods  developed  for  the  behavior  of  photons  in  QED.  The  dimensionless  coupling
constant that governs the graviton exchange process is what we call ‘b ‘  in close analogy
with the dimensionless coupling constant ‘a ‘  in QED, where b

.

As  we  stated,  EMQG  requires  the  existence  of  a  new  fundamental  matter  particle  called
the  ‘masseon’  (and a corresponding ‘anti-masseon’  particle), which are held together by a
new  unidentified  strong  force.  Furthermore,  EMQG  requires  that  masseons  and  anti-
masseons emit gravitons analogous with the electrons and anti-electrons (positrons) which
emit photons in QED. Virtual masseons and anti-masseons are created in equal amounts in
the quantum vacuum as virtual particle pairs. A masseon generates a fixed flux of graviton
particles with wave functions that induce attraction when absorbed by another masseon or
anti-masseon;  and  an  anti-masseon  generates  a  fixed  flux  of  graviton  particles  with  an
opposite wave function (anti-gravitons) that induces repulsion when absorbed by another
masseon  or  anti-masseon.  A  graviton  is  its  own  anti-particle,  just  as  a  photon  is  its  own
antiparticle. This process is similar to, but not identical to the photon exchange processes
in  QED  for  electrons  of  opposite  charge.  In  QED,  an  electron  produces  a  fixed  flux  of
photon  particles  with  wave  functions  that  induces  repulsion  when  absorbed  by  another
electron, and induces attraction when absorbed by a positron. A positron produces a fixed
flux  of  photon  particles  with  wave  functions  that  induces  attraction  when  absorbed  by
another electron, and induces repulsion when absorbed by a positron. From this it can be
seen  that  if  two  sufficiently  large  pieces  of  anti-matter  can  be  fabricated  which  are  both
electrically neutral, they will be found to repel each other gravitationally! Thus anti-matter
can  actually  be  thought  of  as  ‘negative’  mass  (-M),  and  therefore  negative  energy.  This
grossly violates the equivalence principle.

These  subtle  differences  in  the  exchange  process  in  QED  and  EMQG  produce  some
interesting effects for gravitation that are not found in electromagnetism. For example, a
large  gravitational  mass  like  the  earth  does  not  produce  vacuum  polarization  of  virtual
particles  from  the  point  of  view  of  ‘mass-charge’ 
(unlike  electromagnetism).  In
gravitational fields, all the virtual masseon and anti-masseon particles of the vacuum have
a  net  average  statistical  acceleration  directed  downwards  towards  a  large  mass.  This
produces a net downward accelerated flux of vacuum particles (acceleration vectors only)
that effects other masses immersed in this flux.

In contrast to this, an electrically charged object  does  produce  vacuum  polarization.  For
example,  a  negatively  charged  object  will  cause  the  positive  and  negative  (electrically
charged) virtual particles to accelerate towards and away, respectively from the negatively
charged object. Therefore, there is no energy contribution to other real electrically charged
test  particles  placed  near  the  charged  object  from  the  vacuum  particles,  because  the
electrically  charged  vacuum  particles  contribute  equal  amounts  of  force  from  both  the
upward and downward directions. The individual electrical forces from the vacuum cancel
out to zero.

45

In  gravitational  fields,  the  vacuum  particles  are  responsible  for  the  principle  of
equivalence,  precisely  because  of  the  lack  of  vacuum  polarization  due  to  gravitational
fields.  Recall  that  ‘masseon’  particles  of  EMQG  are  equivalent  to  the  ‘parton’  particle
concept  that  was  introduced  by  the  authors  of  reference  5  concerning  HRP  Quantum
Inertia.  Recall  that  the  masseons  and  anti-masseons  also  carry  one  quantum  of  electric
charge of which there are two types; positive and negative charges. For example masseons
come in positive and negative electric charge, and anti-masseons also come in positive and
negative charge. A single charged masseon particle accelerating at 1g sees a certain fixed
amount  of  inertial  force  generated  by  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum.  In  a
gravitational field of 1g, a single charged masseon particle on the surface of the earth sees
the same quantum vacuum electromagnetic force. In other words, from the vantage point
of  a  masseon  particle  that  makes  up  the  total  mass,  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum
vacuum look exactly the same from the point of view of motion and forces whether it is in
an inertial reference frame or in a gravitational field. We propose a new universal constant
“i”  called  the  ‘inertion’,  which  is  defined  as  the  inertial  force  produced  by  the  action  of
virtual  particles  on  a  single  (real  charged)  masseon  particle  undergoing  a  relative
acceleration  of  1  g.  This  force  is  the  lowest  possible  quanta  of  inertial  mass.  All  other
masses  are  fixed  integer  combinations  of  this  number.  This  same  constant  ‘i’  is  also  the
lowest possible quanta of gravitational force.

The electric charge that is carried by the electron, positron, quark and anti-quark originate
from combinations of masseons, which is the fundamental source of the electrical charge.
This  explains  why  a  fixed  charge  relationship  exists  between  the  quarks  and  the  leptons,
which  belong  to  different  families  in  the  standard  model.  For  example,  according  to  the
standard  model,  1  proton  charge  precisely  equals  1  electron  charge  (opposite  polarity),
where  the  proton  is  made  of  3  quarks.  This  precise  equality  arises  from  the  fact  that
charged masseon particles are present in the internal structure of both the quarks and the
electrons (and every other mass particle).

The  mathematical  renormalization  process  is  applied  to  particles  to  avoid  infinities
encountered in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) calculations. This is justified by postulating a
high  frequency  cutoff  of  the  vacuum  processes  in  the  summation  of  the  Feynman
diagrams.  Recall  that  QED  is  formulated  on  the  assumption  that  a  perfect  space-time
continuum  exists.  In  EMQG,  a  high  frequency  cutoff  is  essential  because  space  is
quantized  as  ‘cells’,  specified  by  Cellular  Automata  (CA)  theory.  In  CA  theory  there  is
quantization  of  space  as  cells.  If  particles  are  sufficiently  close  enough,  they  completely
lose their identity as particles in CA theory, and QFT does not apply at this scale. Since
graviton  exchanges  are  almost  identical  to  photon  exchanges,  we  suspect  that  EMQG  is
also  renormalizable  as  is  QED,  with  a  high  frequency  cutoff  as  well.  This  has  not  been
proven yet. The reason that some current quantum gravity theories are not renormalizable
boils  down  to  the  fact  that  the  graviton  is  assumed  to  be  the  only  boson  involved  in
gravitational interactions. The graviton must therefore exhibit all the characteristics of the
gravitational field, including space-time curvature.

46

In EMQG, the photon exchange and graviton exchange process is virtually identical in its
basic nature, which shows the great symmetry between these two forces. As a byproduct
of this, the quantum vacuum becomes ‘neutral’  in terms of gravitational ‘mass charge’, as
the quantum vacuum is known to be neutral with respect to electric charge. This is due to
an  equal  number  of  positive  and  negative  electrical  charged  virtual  particles  and
‘gravitational charged’  virtual particles created in the quantum vacuum at any given time.
This  in  turn  is  due  to  the  symmetrical  masseon  and  anti-masseon  pair  creation  process.
(EMQG does not resolve the problem of why the universe was created with an apparent
imbalance of real ordinary matter and anti-matter mass particles.)

This  distortion  of  the  acceleration  vectors  of  the  quantum  vacuum  ‘stream’  serves  as  an
effective  ‘electromagnetic  guide’  for  the  motion  of  nearby  test  masses  (themselves
consisting  of  masseons)  through  space  and  time.  This  ‘electromagnetic  guide’  concept
replaces  the  4D  space-time  geodesics  (which  is  the  path  that  light  takes  through  curved
4D  space-time)  that  guide  light  and  matter  in  motion.  Because  the  quantum  vacuum
virtual particle density is quite high, but not infinite (at least about 1090 particles/m3), the
quantum vacuum acts as a very effective and energetic guide for the motion of light and
matter.

(A-9) Introduction to 4D Space-Time Curvature and EMQG

The physicist A. Wheeler once said that: “space-time geometry ‘tells’  mass-energy how to
move,  and  mass-energy  ‘tells’  space-time  geometry  how  to  curve”.  In  EMQG,  this
statement  must  be  somewhat  revised  on  the  quantum  particle  level  to  read:  large  mass-
energy  concentrations  (consisting  of  quantum  particles)  exchanges  gravitons  with  the
immediate  surrounding  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum,  causing  a  downward
acceleration  (of  the  net  statistical  average  acceleration  vectors)  of  the  quantum  vacuum
particles.  This  downward  acceleration  of  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum
‘tells’  a  nearby  test  mass  (also  consisting  of  real  quantum  particles)  how  to  move
electromagnetically,  by  the  exchange  of  photons  between  the  electrically  charged,  and
falling  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  and  the  electrical  charged,  real  particles
inside the test mass. This new view of gravity is totally based on the ideas of quantum field
theory,  and  thus  acknowledging  the  true  particle  nature  of  both  matter  and  forces.  It  is
also shows how nature is non-geometric when examined on the smallest of distance scales,
where Riemann geometry is now replaced solely by the interactions of quantum particles
existing on a kind of quantized 3D space and separate time on the CA.

Since  this  downward  accelerated  stream  of  charged  virtual  particles  also  affects  light  or
real photons and the motion of real matter (for example, matter making up a clock), the
concept of space-time must be revised. For example, a light beam moving parallel to the
surface of the earth is affected by the downward acceleration of charged virtual particles
(electromagnetically), and moves in a curved path. Since light is at the foundation of the
measurement  process  as  Einstein  showed  in  special  relativity,  the  concept  of  space-time
must  also  be  affected  near  the  earth  by  this  accelerated  ‘stream’  of  virtual  particles.
Nothing escapes this ‘flow’, and one can imagine that not even a clock is expected to keep

47

the  same  time  as  it  would  in  far  space.  As  a  result,  a  radically  new  picture  of  Einstein’s
curved space-time concept arises from these considerations in EMQG.

The variation of the value of the net statistical average (directional) acceleration vector of
the quantum vacuum particles from point to point in space (with respect to the center of a
massive object) guides the motion of nearby test masses and the motion of light through
electromagnetic means. This process leads to the 4D space-time metric curvature concept
of general relativity. With this new viewpoint, it is now easy to understand how one can
switch  between  accelerated  and  gravitational  reference  frames.  Gravity  can  be  made  to
cancel  out  inside  a  free  falling  frame  (technically  at  a  point)  above  the  earth  because  we
are simply taking on the same net acceleration as the virtual particles at that point. In this
scenario,  the  falling  reference  frame  creates  the  same  quantum  vacuum  particle
background  environment  as  found  in  an  non-accelerated  frame,  far  from  all  gravitational
fields. As a result, light travels in perfectly straight lines when viewed by a falling observer,
as specified by special relativity.

Thus  in  the  falling  reference  frame,  a  mass  ‘feels’  no  force  or  curvature  as  it  would  in
empty  space,  and  light  travels  in  straight  lines  (defined  as  ‘flat’  space-time).  Thus  the
mystery  as  to  why  different  reference  frames  produce  different  space-time  curvature  is
solved in EMQG. It is interesting that in an accelerated rocket 4D space-time curvature is
also present, but now is caused by another mechanism; the accelerated motion of the floor
of the rocket itself. In other words, the space-time curvature, manifesting itself as the path
of curved light, is really caused by the accelerated motion of the observer! The observer
(now in a state of acceleration with respect to the vacuum), ‘sees’  the accelerated virtual
particle motion in his frame. Furthermore, the motion appears to him to be almost exactly
the  same  as  if  he  were  in  an  equivalent  gravitational  field.  This  is  why  the  space-time
curvature  appears  the  same  in  both  a  gravitational  field  and  an  equivalent  accelerated
frame.  These  differences  between  accelerated  and  gravitational  frames  imply  that
equivalence  is  not  a  basic  element  of  reality,  but  merely  a  result  of  different  physical
processes, which happen to give the same results. In fact, equivalence is not perfect!

According  to  EMQG,  all  metric  theories  of  gravity,  including  general  relativity,  have  a
limited  range  of  application.  These  theories  are  useful  only  when  a  sufficient  mass  is
available to significantly distort the virtual particle motion surrounding the mass; and only
where  the  electromagnetic  interaction  dominates  over  the  graviton  processes  (or  where
the  graviton  flux  is  not  too  large).  For  precise  calculation  of  gravitational  force
interactions  of  small  masses,  EMQG  requires  that  the  gravitational  interaction  be
calculated  by  adding  the  specific  Feynman  diagrams  for  both  photon  and  graviton
exchanges.  Thus,  the  use  of  the  general  relativistic  Schwarzchild  Metric  for  spherical
bodies  (even  if  modified  by  including  the  uncertainty  principle)  is  totally  useless  for
understanding the gravitational interactions of elementary particles. The whole concept of
space-time ‘foam’  is incorrect according to EMQG, along with all the causality problems
associated with this complex mathematical concept.

(A-10) Space-Time Curvature is a Pure Virtual Particle Quantum Vacuum Process

4D Minkowski curved space-time takes on a radically new meaning in EMQG, and is no
longer a basic physical element of our reality. Instead, it is merely the result of quantum
particle interactions alone. The curved space-time of general relativity arises strictly out of
the interactions between the falling virtual particles of the quantum vacuum near a massive
object  and  a  nearby  test  mass.  The  effect  of  the  falling  quantum  vacuum  acts  somewhat
like  a  special  kind  of  “Fizeau-Fluid”  or  media,  that  effects  the  propagation  of  light;  and
also effects clocks, rulers, and measuring instruments. Fizeau demonstrated in the middle
1850’s that moving water varies the velocity of light propagating through it.

This  effect  was  analyzed  mathematically  by  Lorentz.  He  used  his  newly  developed
microscopic theory for the propagation of light in matter to study how photons move in a
flowing  stream  of  transparent  fluid.  He  reasoned  that  photons  would  change  velocity  by
frequent scattering with the molecules of the water, where the photons are absorbed and
later remitted after a small time delay. This concept is discussed in detail in section 9.3.

If  Einstein  himself  had  known  about  the  existence  of  the  quantum  vacuum  when  he  was
developing general relativity theory, he may have deduced that space-time curvature was
caused by the “accelerated quantum vacuum fluid”. He was aware of the work by Fizeau,
but  was  unaware  of  the  existence  of  the  quantum  vacuum.  After  all,  Einstein  certainly
realized  that  clocks  were  not  expected  to  keep  time  correctly  when  immersed  in  an
accelerated  stream  of  water!  We  show  mathematically  in  this  paper  that  the  quantity  of
space-time  curvature  near  a  spherical  object  predicted  by  the  Schwarzchild  metric  is
identical to the value given by the ‘Fizeau-like’  scattering process in EMQG.

In EMQG when we find an accelerated vacuum disturbance, there follows a corresponding
space-time  distortion  (including  the  possibility  of  gravitational  waves  for  dynamic
accelerated  disturbances).  We  have  seen  that  both  accelerated  and  gravitational  frames
qualify  for  the  status  of  curved  4D  space-time  (although  caused  by  different  physical
circumstances).  We  have  found  that  in  EMQG  there  exists  two,  separate  but  related
space-time  coordinate  systems.  First,  there  is  the  familiar  global  four  dimensional
relativistic  space-time  of  Minkowski,  as  defined  by  our  measuring  instruments,  and  is
designated by the x,y,z,t in Cartesian coordinates. The amount of 4D space-time curvature
is influenced by accelerated frames and by gravitational frames, which is the cause of the
accelerated state of the quantum vacuum.

Secondly there is a kind of a quantized absolute space, and separate time as required by
cellular automaton theory. Absolute space consists of an array of numbers or cells C(x,y,z)
that changes state after every new clock operation D
t. C(x,y,z) acts like the absolute three
dimensional  pre-relativistic  space,  with  a  separate  absolute  time  that  acts  to  evolve  the
numerical state of the cellular automata. The CA space (and separate time) is not affected
by any physical interactions or directly accessible through any measuring instruments, and
currently  remains  a  postulate  of  EMQG.  Note  that  EMQG  absolute  space  does  not
correspond  to  Newton’s  idea  of  absolute  space.  Newton  postulated  the  existence  of

49

absolute space in his work on inertia. He realized that absolute space was required in order
to resolve the puzzle of what reference frame nature uses to gauge accelerated motion. In
EMQG,  this  reference  frame  is  not  the  absolute  quantized  cell  space  (which  is
unobservable),  but  instead  consists  of  the  net  average  state  of  acceleration  of  the  virtual
particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  with  respect  to  matter  (particles).  A  very  important
consequence of the existence of absolute quantized space and quantized time (required by
cellular automaton theory) is the fact that our universe must have a maximum speed limit!

(A-11) THE BASIC POSTULATES OF EMQG

Here  is  a  summary  of  the  basic  postulates  of  EMQG.  Reference  1  gives  a  much  more
complete  description  of  the  postulates  and  their  consequences.  Note  that  we  do  not
include Einstein’s principle of equivalence as one of our basic postulates. This is because
equivalence is not a fundamental principle. Instead equivalence is simply a consequence of
quantum particle interactions. The basic postulates of EMQG are:

POSTULATE #1:      CELLULAR AUTOMATA

The universe is a vast cellular automaton computation, which has an inherently quantized
absolute  3D  space  consisting  of  ‘cells’,  and  absolute  time.  The  numeric  information  in  a
cell changes state through the action of the numeric content of the immediate neighboring
cells  (26  neighbors)  and  the  local  mathematical  rules,  which  are  repeated  for  each  and
every  cell.  The  action  of  absolute  time  (through  clock  cycles)  synchronizes  the  state
transition of all the cells. The number of ‘clock cycles’  elapsed between the change of the
numeric  state  on  the  CA  is  a  measure  of  the  absolute  time  elapsed.  The  cells  are
interconnected  (mathematically)  to  form  a  simple  3D  geometric  CA.  Matter,  forces,  and
motion are the end result of information changing in the cells as absolute time progresses.
Gravity, motion, and any other physical process do not effect low-level absolute 3D space
and absolute time in any way. Photons propagate in the simplest possible manner on the
CA.  Photons  simply  shift  from  cell  to  adjacent  cell  on  each  and  every  'clock  cycle'  in  a
given  direction.  This  rate  represents  the  maximum  speed  that  information  can  be  moved
during a CA ‘clock cycle’. The quantization scale is not known yet, but it must be much
finer than the Plank Scale for distance and time.

POSTULATE #2:      GRAVITON-MASSEON PARTICLES

The masseon is the most elementary form of matter (or anti-matter), and carries the lowest
possible quanta of low level, gravitational ‘mass charge’. The masseon carries the lowest
possible quanta of positive gravitational ‘mass  charge’,  where  the  low  level  gravitational
‘mass charge’  is defined as the (probability) fixed rate of emission of graviton particles in
close  analogy  to  electric  charge  in  QED.  Gravitational  ‘mass  charge’  is  a  fixed  constant
and  analogous  to  the  fixed  electrical  charge  concept.  Gravitational  ‘mass  charge’  is not
governed  by  the  ordinary  physical  laws  of  observable  mass,  which  appear  as  ‘m’  in  the
various physical theories, including Einstein’s special relativity mass-velocity relationship:
E=mc2  or  m  =  m0  (1  -  v2/c2)-1/2.  Masseons  simultaneously  carry  a  positive  gravitational

50

‘mass  charge’,  and  either  a  positive  or  negative  electrical  charge  (defined  exactly  as  in
QED). Therefore we conclude that masseons also exchange photons with other masseon
particles.  Masseons  are  fermions  with  half  integer  spin,  which  behave  according  to  the
rules of quantum field theory. Gravitons (which are closely analogous to photons) have a
spin of one (not spin two, as is commonly thought), and travel at the speed of light. Anti-
masseons carry the lowest quanta of negative gravitational ‘mass charge’. Anti-masseons
also carry either positive or negative electrical charge, with electrical charge being defined
according  to  QED.  An  anti-masseon  is  always  created  with  an  ordinary  masseon  in  a
particle  pair  as  required  by  quantum  field  theory  (specifically,  the  Dirac  equation).  The
anti-masseon  is  the  negative  energy  solution  of  the  Dirac  equation  for  a  fermion,  where
now  the  mass  is  taken  to  be  ‘negative’  as  well,  in  clear  violation  of  the  principle  of
equivalence. Another important property exhibited by the graviton particle is the principle
of  superposition.  This  property  works  the  same  way  as  for  photons.  The  action  of  the
gravitons  originating  from  all  sources  acts  to  yield  a  net  vector  sum  for  the  receiving
particle. EMQG treats graviton exchanges by the same successful methods developed for
the  behavior  of  photons  in  QED.  The  dimensionless  coupling  constant  that  governs  the
graviton  exchange  process  is  what  we  call  ‘b ‘  in  close  analogy  with  the  dimensionless
 10-40 a
coupling constant ‘a ‘  in QED, where b

 »

.

POSTULATE #3:      QUANTUM THEORY OF INERTIA

The property which Newton called the inertial mass of an object, is caused by the vacuum
resistance to acceleration of all the individual, electrically charged masseon particles that
make up the mass. This resistance force is caused by the electromagnetic force interaction
(where  the  details  of  this  process  are  unknown  at  this  time)  occurring  between  the
electrically charged virtual masseon/anti-masseon particle pairs created in the surrounding
quantum  vacuum,  and  all  the  real  masseons  particles  making  up  the  accelerated  mass.
Therefore  inertia  originates  in  the  photon  exchanges  with  the  electrically  charged  virtual
masseon particles of the quantum vacuum. The total inertial force Fi  of  a  mass  is  simply
the sum of all the little forces fp contributed by each of the individual masseons, where the
sum is: Fi = (S

 fp) = MA (Newton’s law of inertia).

POSTULATE #4:      PHOTON FIZEAU-LIKE SCATTERING IN THE VACUUM

Photons  have  an  absolute,  fixed  velocity  resulting  from  its  special  motion  on  the  CA,
where photons simply shift from cell to adjacent cell on every CA ‘clock cycle’. This ‘low
level’  photon velocity (measured in CA absolute space and time units) is much higher (by
an unknown amount) than the observed light velocity of 300,000 km/sec. This is because a
photon traveling in the vacuum (in an inertial frame) takes on a path through the quantum
vacuum,  that  is  the  end  result  of  a  vast  number  of  electromagnetic  scattering  processes
with  the  surrounding  electrically  charged  virtual  particles.  Each  scattering  process
introduces a small random delay in the subsequent remission of the photon, and results in a
cumulative reduction in the velocity of photon propagation. Real photons that travel near
a large mass like the earth, take a path through the quantum vacuum that is the end result
of  a  large  number  of  electromagnetic  scattering  processes  with  the  falling  (statistical

51

average) electrically charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. The resulting path is
one where the photons maintain a net statistical average acceleration of zero with respect
to the electrically charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum, through a process that
is  very  similar  to  the  Fizeau  scattering  of  light  through  moving  water.  Through  very
frequent  absorption  and  re-emission  (which  introduces  a  small  delay)  by  the  accelerated
charged  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum,  the  apparent  light  velocity  assumes  an
accelerated value with respect to the center of mass in absolute CA space and time units.
(Note: The light velocity is still an absolute constant when moving in between virtual
particles, and is always created at this fixed constant velocity dictated by the CA rules).
The accelerated virtual particles of the quantum vacuum that appears in gravitational and
accelerated  reference  frames  can  be  viewed  as  a  special  Fizeau-like  vacuum  fluid.  This
fluid effects the motion of matter and light in the direction of the fluid acceleration, which
is ultimately responsible for 4D space-time curvature.

(A-12) Experimental Verification of EMQG Theory

EMQG  proposes  several  new  experimental  tests  that  give  results  that  differ  from  the
conventional general relativistic physics, and can thus be used to verify the theory.

(1)  EMQG  opens  up  a  new  field  of  physics,  which  we  call  anti-matter  gravitational
physics. We propose that if two sufficiently large pieces of anti-matter are manufactured
to  allow  measurement  of  the  mutual  gravitational  interaction  (with  a  torsion  balance
apparatus  for  example),  then  the  gravitational  force  will  be  found  to  be  repulsive!  The
force will be equal in magnitude to -GM2/r2 where M is the mass of each of the anti-matter
masses,  r  is  their  mutual  separation,  and  G  is  Newton’s  gravitational  constant.  This  is  a
gross violation of the principle of equivalence, since in this case, Mi  =  - Mg , instead of
being strictly equal. Antimatter that is accelerated in far space has the same inertial mass
‘Mi’  as ordinary matter, but when interacting gravitationally with another antimatter mass
it  is  repelled  (Mg).  Note  that  the  earth  will  attract  bulk  anti-matter  because  of  the  large
abundance of gravitons originating from the earth of the type that induce attraction. This
means  that  no  violation  of  equivalence  is  expected  for  anti-matter  dropped  on  the  earth,
where  anti-matter  falls  normally.  However,  an  antimatter  earth  will  repel  a  nearby
antimatter  mass.  Recent  attempts  at  measuring  earth’s  gravitational  force  on  anti-matter
(for example on anti-protons) will not reveal any deviation from equivalence, according to
EMQG. However, if there were two large identical masses of matter and anti-matter close
to each other, there would be no gravitational force existing between them because of the
balance  of  “positive  and  negative”  masses,  for  example  equal  numbers  of  gravitons  that
induce  attraction  and  repulsion.  This  gravitational  system  is  considered  gravitationally
‘neutral’  as is the quantum vacuum, which is also gravitationally neutral.

(2)  For  an  extremely  large  test  mass  and  a  very  small  test  mass  that  is  dropped
simultaneously on the earth (in a vacuum), there will be an  extremely small difference in
the arrival time of the masses on the surface of the earth in slight violation of the principle
of equivalence. This effect is on the order of  »
 D N x d , where D N is the difference in the
number of masseon particles in the two masses, and  d   is  the  ratio  of  the  gravitational  to

52

electric forces for one masseon. This experiment is very difficult to perform on the earth,
because  d   is  extremely  small  (» 10-40),  and  D N  cannot  be  made  sufficiently  large.  To
achieve  a  difference  of  D N  =1030  masseons  particles  between  the  small  and  large  mass
requires dropping a molecular-sized cluster and a large military tank simultaneously in the
vacuum in order to give a measurable deviation. Note that for ordinary objects that might
seem to have a large enough difference in mass (like dropping a feather and a tank), the
difference in arrival time would be obscured by background interference, and possibly by
quantum  effects  like  the  Heisenberg  uncertainty  principle  which  restrict  the  accuracy  of
arrival time measurements.

(3) If gravitons can be detected by the invention of a graviton detector/counter in the far
future,  then  there  will  be  experimental  proof  for  the  violation  of  the  strong  principle  of
equivalence.  The  strong  equivalence  principle  states  that  all  the  laws  of  physics  are  the
same  for  an  observer  situated  on  the  surface  of  the  earth  as  it  is  for  an  accelerated
observer  at  1  g.  The  graviton  detector  will  find  a  tremendous  difference  in  the  graviton
count in these two cases. This is because gravitons are vastly more numerous here on the
earth.  Thus  a  detector  can  manufactured  with  an  indicator  that  distinguishes  between
whether an observer is in an inertial frame or in a gravitational frame. This of course is a
gross violation of the strong equivalence principle.

(4) Since the gravitational mass of an object has a strong electrical force component, mass
measurements near the earth might be disrupted experimentally by manipulating some of
the  electrically  charged  virtual  particles  of  the  nearby  quantum  vacuum  through
electromagnetic means. If a rapidly fluctuating magnetic field (or rotating magnetic field)
is produced directly under a mass it might effect the instantaneous charged virtual particle
spectrum and disrupt the tiny electrical forces for many of the masseons in the mass. This
may reduce the measured gravitational (and inertial masses) of a test mass. In a sense this
device would act like a primitive and weak “anti-gravity” machine.

The  virtual  particles  are  constantly  being  “turned-over”  in  the  vacuum  at  different  rates,
with the high frequency virtual particles (and therefore, the high-energy virtual particles)
being replaced the quickest. If a magnetic field is made to fluctuate fast enough so that it
does  not  allow  the  new  electrically  charged  virtual  particle  pairs  to  replace  the  old  and
smooth  out  the  disruption,  the  spectrum  of  the  virtual  particles  in  the  vicinity  may  be
altered.  According  to  conventional  physics,  the  energy  density  of  virtual  particles  is
infinite, which means that all frequencies of virtual particles are present. In EMQG there is
an  upper  cut-off  to  the  frequency,  and  therefore  the  highest  energy  according  to  the
Plank’s law: E=hu
 is the frequency that a virtual particle can have. We can state
that the smallest wavelength that a virtual particle can have is about 10-35 meters, e.g. the
plank wavelength (or a corresponding maximum Plank frequency of about 1043  hertz  for
very high velocity (» c) virtual particles). Unfortunately for our “anti-gravity”  device, it is
technologically  impossible  to  disrupt  these  highest  frequencies.  Recall  that  according  to
t > h/(2p ). This
the uncertainty principle, the relationship between energy and time is: D E D
means that the high frequency end of the spectrum consists of virtual particles that “turns-
over”  the  fastest.  To  give  maximum  disruption  to  a  significant  percentage  of  the  high

, where u

53

frequency virtual particles require magnetic fluctuations on the order of at least 1020 cycles
per  seconds.  Therefore  only  lower  frequencies  virtual  particles  of  the  vacuum  can  be
practically  affected  in  the  future,  and  only  small  changes  in  the  measured  mass  can  be
expected with today’s technology.

As  a  result  of  this  we  conclude  that  the  higher  the  frequency  the  greater  the  mass  loss.
Recent  work  on  the  Quantum  Hall  Effect  by  Laughlin  on  fractional  electron  charge
suggests  that,  under  the  influence  of  a  strong  magnetic  field,  electrons  might  move  in
concert with swirling vortices created in the 2D electron gas. This leads to the possibility
that  this  ‘whirlpool’  phenomenon  also  holds  for  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum
vacuum  under  the  influence  of  a  strongly  fluctuating  magnetic  field.  These  high-speed
whirlpools might disrupt the high frequency end of the distribution of electrically charged
virtual  particles  into  small  pockets.  Therefore,  there  might  be  a  greater  mass  loss  under
these circumstances, an idea this is very speculative at this time. Experiments that report
mass reduction associated with rapidly rotating superconducting magnets, which generate
high frequency rotating magnetic fields are inconclusive at this time. Reference 6 gives an
excellent  and  detailed  review  of  the  various  experiments  on  reducing  the  gravitational
force with superconducting magnets.

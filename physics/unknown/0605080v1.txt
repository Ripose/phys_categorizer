Introduction: the atmospheric electrical environment on Venus 
All  planetary  atmospheres  are  electrified  to  some  extent  by  cosmic  ray  ionization,  and  Venus  is  no 
exception.  There  is  increasing  awareness  that  ion-aerosol  interactions  could  modulate  terrestrial 
radiative  processes,  and  this  possibility  will  be  investigated  for  the  Venusian  atmosphere.  The 
likelihood of a Venusian global atmospheric electric circuit (defined below) will also be discussed.  
 
Venus’ atmosphere is dense enough for ions and electrons formed by cosmic rays to rapidly produce 
ion  clusters1.  Common  predicted  positive  species  are  H3O+(H2O)n  (n  =  3  or  4),  H3O+(SO2)  and 
H3O+(H2O)(SO2). Sulphate species dominate predicted negative ion species, and free electrons are also 
expected above 60km. Because of the ubiquity of the cloud cover (at ~50-70km), attachment to cloud 
particles  is  an  important  global  ion  loss  mechanism,  significantly  reducing  charged  particle 
concentrations1. 

Could there be a global electric circuit on Venus? 
A  global  atmospheric  at  electric  circuit  needs,  at  the  minimum,  electrostatic  discharge  or  charged 
particle  precipitation  balanced  by  current  carried  by  mobile  charged  particles  between  a  conductive 
ionosphere and surface2. A global circuit causes transport of charged particles between different parts 
of the atmosphere. At the moment, the existence of a Venusian global electric circuit seems unlikely 
due to the lack of proof for electrostatic discharges3. If lightning is unambiguously observed, then there 
is a good basis for the existence of a global circuit because of the presence of ions and electrons and a 
conducting ionosphere. 

Electrification and particle formation 
A  potentially  important  mechanism  for  cloud  formation  at  the  bottom  of  the  cloud  layer  is  vapour 
condensing  onto  aerosol  particles4.  The  atmosphere  is  supersaturated  with  respect  to  sulphuric  acid 
from  40km  upwards,  where  H2SO4  vapour  can  condense  onto  hydrated  sulphuric  acid  particles.  As 
Venusian  atmospheric  ions  are  predicted  to  be  sulphuric  acid  hydrates,  appropriate  conditions  may 
exist for aerosols to form by ion-induced nucleation. The supersaturation required for ions to grow into 
ultrafine  droplets  by  direct  condensation  can  be  determined  using  the  Thompson  equation5.  This 
equation  describes  the  equilibrium  saturation  ratio  needed  for  ion-induced  nucleation  to  become 
energetically favourable. The equilibrium condition is defined at a saturation ratio S, where r is radius, 
ρ fluid density, M the mass of the molecule, q charge, γT the surface tension, kB Boltzmann’s constant, 
T temperature, ro the initial radius (all in SI units), and εr relative permittivity:

(1)  can  be  used  to  assess  if  condensation  of  gaseous  H2SO4  onto  ions  is  likely  to  occur  in  the  lower 
cloud-forming regions at ~40km. To calculate S, H2SO4 concentrations and supersaturations determined 
from  microwave  absorption  measurements  are  used6.  Temperatures  were  obtained  from  a  model 
atmosphere . Surface tension, density and dielectric constant for ~

temperatures  reduce  the  SS  needed  for  activation.  Figure  1  shows  the  solution  of  (1)  at  395K.  SS  is 
never  high  enough  to  activate  particles  with  one  electronic  charge,  but  doubly  charged  particles  of 
radius 1nm can nucleate at SS=7%, and particles with 5 charges of radius 2nm are activated at SS=1-
2%,  relatively  easily  attained  SS  levels6.  The  number  of  doubly  charged  particles  can  be  estimated 
from  the  aerosol  charge  distribution  arising  from  ion-aerosol  attachment  processes.  The  steady  state 
charge  distribution  of  a  monodisperse  aerosol  population,  represented  as  the  ratio  of  the  number  of 
particles with charge j, Nj, to the number of neutral particles, N0, can be given by

where j is the electronic charge, a the mean aerosol radius, and x is the “ion asymmetry factor”7. The 
charge distribution can be calculated for T=395K and typical ion properties at 40km. The mobility of 
positive  ions  was  assumed  to  be  7%  higher  than  negative  ions,  with  no  free  electrons  below  60km1. 
Positive and negative ions were assumed to exist in equal concentrations. The aerosol diameter at 40km 
was  assumed  to be 0.25μm1.  Substituting  for a,  T  and  x  in (2)  indicates  that  84% of  aerosols  in  this 
region  carry  some  charge, with  the  most  common  single  charge  state  being  +1.    The mean  charge  is 
+0.2, but, across the estimated charge distribution, Figure 2, j ≥ 2 is relatively common with 54% of 
Venusian aerosols carry enough charge f
on-induced nucleation at supersaturations of 7%, and 7% 
of the aerosol population carries enough c
rge for nucleation at 1-2% supersaturation. These estimates 
suggest  that  it  may  be  possible  for  gase
s  sulphuric  acid  to  condense  onto  ions  and  form  aerosol 
particles.

Abstract 

The TOTEM experiment will detect leading protons scattered in angles of microradians from the interaction point at the Large 
Hadron  Collider.  This  will  be  achieved  using  detectors  with  a  minimized  dead  area  at  the  edge.  The  collaboration  has 
developed an innovative structure at the detector edge reducing the conventional dead width to less than 100 μm, still using 
standard  planar fabrication  technology.  In  this new  development,  the current  of  the  surface  is decoupled  from the  sensitive 
volume current within a few tens of micrometers. The basic working principle is explained in this paper. Final size detectors 
have  been  produced  using  this  approach.  The  current-voltage  and  current-temperature  characteristics  of  the  detectors  were 
studied and the detectors were successfully tested in a coasting beam experiment.

1. Introduction 

‘edgeless’  microstrip 

 The  TOTEM  experiment  [1],[2]  will  detect 
leading protons  scattered  in angles of  microradians 
at  the  Large  Hadron  Collider  (LHC).  This  will  be 
achieved  using 
tracking 
detectors  with  a  minimized  dead  width  located  in 
special  insertions  called  Roman  Pots  [3].  The 
detectors  will  approach  the  beam  center  to  a 
distance of 10 σ + 0.5 mm (=1.3 mm), and the dead 
space  near  the  detector  edge  must  not  exceed  100 
μm  to  ensure  the  required  acceptance  in  leading 
proton detection.  

The  working  principle  of  planar  edgeless 
detectors  has  been  introduced  in  [1].  The  typical 
distance  between  the  strips  of  the  detector  and  the 
cut edge is 50 μm, allowing the sensitive volume to 
be  as  close  as  60  μm  from  the  cut  edge  of  the 
detector [4]. 

Final  size  planar  edgeless  detectors  for  the 
TOTEM experiment have been produced and tested. 
Their  electrical  and  thermal  performance  has  been 
studied. The detectors were inserted in a Roman Pot 
prototype  attached  to  the  beam  pipe  of  the  Super 
Proton  Synchrotron,  and  their  response  to  high 
energy  protons  in  a  coasting  beam  experiment  was 
investigated. 

2. Planar edgeless detector: working principle 

Standard  planar  silicon  detectors  have  a  typical 
insensitive  border  region  around  the  sensitive  area 
of  0.5  mm  occupied  by  guardrings.  This  voltage 
terminating  structure  drops  the  voltage  gradually 
between the detector sensitive area and the detector 
edge. 

The basic idea of this new approach is to reduce 
the insensitive border below 100 μm by applying a 
large fraction of the detector bias across the detector 
chip  cut  through  an  outer  current  terminating  ring 
(CTR)  that  collects  the  major  part  of  the  resulting 
surface generated current ICTR (see Figure 1).

3. Final size planar edgeless detector 

Final  size  planar  edgeless  detectors  have  been 
developed  and  produced  in  a  joint  effort  of  the 
TOTEM  group  at  CERN  and  the  Megaimpulse,  a 
spin-off company from the Ioffe Physico-Technical 
Institute in St. Petersburg (RUSSIA). These devices 
are microstrip detectors with 512 strips, with a pitch 
of  66  μm  processed  on  very  high  resistivity  n-type 
silicon  wafer  (>10  kΩ·cm),  300  μm  thick.  All  of 
them have a CTR as described in Section 2 on one 
edge (the bottom edge in Figure 2) and AC coupled 
strips biased through the biasing electrode. In these 
devices, 
is  electrically 
connected to the clean-up ring. For these detectors, 
the nominal d value was set to 20 μm. A picture of a 
final size detector mounted on the readout board is 
shown in Figure 2.  

the  biasing  electrode 

The  strips  (sketched  in  Figure  5)  are  at  a  45° 
angle  from  the  vertical  axis.  Flipping  around  the 
vertical axis yields strips reoriented orthogonally. 

3.1. Electric Characterisation 

The  produced  samples  were  tested  on  a  sample 
holder  with  CR  and  CTR  both  bonded  to  allow 
current/voltage  (I-V)  and  current/temperature  (I-T) 
measurements using the biasing scheme of Figure 1. 
Typical values of currents measured at the CTR and 
the  CR,  ICTR  and  ICR  in  Figure  1,  are  shown  in 
Figure 3.  

There is a difference of four orders of magnitude 
between the current at the CR and the CTR. This is 
strong  evidence  that  a  very  large  fraction  of  the 
leakage current generated at the surface is collected 
by  the  CTR,  preserving  the  detector  active  area 
from almost any surface current, which would make 
the detector operation impossible.  

The low current flowing in the CR confirms the 
validity  of  the  current  termination  approach:  the 
sensitive  bulk,  even  if  it  extends  to  a  few  tens  of 
micrometers  from  the  cut  edge  is  free  of  the  large 
current flowing at the surface.  

These  detectors  deplete  fully  at  the  reverse  bias 
of  ~30  V  and  have  shown  to  be  stable  for  biases 
higher  than  150  V.  In  order  to  study  the  nature  of 
the  bulk  and  the  surface  currents,  their  behaviour 
with  different  temperatures  was  also  measured.  A

and  the  readout  board.  Only  the  bottom  edge  has  a  CTS.  The 
strips are oriented at a 45° angle from the vertical axis. (Bottom)

these 

The  current  collected  by  the  CR  shows  an 
exponential  increase  with  the  temperature.  The 
current  flowing  through  the  CTR  increases  with 
temperature  but  at  a  lower  rate  than  the  bulk 
current.  The  average  activation  energy  of  0.6  eV 
gathered from ICR(T) in Figure 4 allows to conclude 
that  the  current  measured  at  the  clean-up  ring 
consists  in  mainly  bulk  generated  current.  These 
data still confirm the basic idea of the CTS and the 
decoupling  of  the  bulk  current  from  the  surface 
current  (a  difference  of  three  orders  of  magnitude 
even higher at lower temperatures) and show that a 
the  surface  current  with 
further  reduction  of 
temperature is possible.

4. Beam Tests 

4.1. Experimental Setup  

bottom pots, located along the beamline of the SPS 
accelerator ring hosted a set of detectors each. The 
secondary  vacuum  of  the  detectors  was  separated 
from  the  primary  beam  vacuum  by  a  thin  window 
foil (140 μm for the bottom pot and 210 μm for the 
top one).  

The  vertical  position  of  the  Roman  Pots  was 
adjusted  by  micrometric  screws  controlled  by 
stepping  motors  allowing  one  set  of  detectors  to 
approach the beam axis from the top, and the other 
one  from  the  bottom.  Both  sets  of  detectors 
consisted  of  four  pairs  of  edgeless  detectors,  each 
pair consisting of detectors mounted together back-
to-back,  defining  an  (x,y)  coordinate  point.  Three 
pairs were used for tracking and were read out with 
analogue  APV25  chips  [6].  One  pair  was  read  out 
with  digital  VFAT  chips  delivering  the  fast-or 
signal of all 512 strips [7]. The latter were used for 
triggering 
in 
coincidence with the sum signal of the four pick-up 
electrodes of a beam position monitor located close 
to the detectors.

the  SPS  accelerator:  1  single  bunch

equally spaced trains of 4 bunches of 8 × 1010 270 
GeV protons with a revolution period of 23 μs [8].

4.2. Analysis and Results 

Detector  data  were  taken  with  the  two  pots 
moving  independently  between  6  mm  and  14  mm 
(σbeam = 0.8 mm) from the beam pipe centre. Beam 
halo protons were detected at typical rates of 3 kHz. 
Figure  5  shows  the  halo  profiles  measured  by  two 
orthogonal detector planes of this pot. 

 The detectors had a typical signal-to-noise ratio 
of  22.  There  were  a  few  noisy  channels  on  both 
detectors  which  have  been  removed  from  the 
profiles. 

The  edgeless  planar  silicon  detectors  were 
studied in a coasting beam experiment in the Super 
Proton  Synchrotron (SPS)  at  CERN. A  Roman  Pot 
unit  prototype  consisting  of  a  vacuum  chamber 
equipped  with  two  vertical  insertions,  top  and

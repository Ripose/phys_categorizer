Abstract 

In  this  paper  we  present  a  systematic  study  of  photonic  bandgap  engineering  using 

aperiodic lattices (AL’s). Up to now AL’s have tended to be defined by specific formulae 

(e.g. Fibonacci, Cantor), and theories have neglected other useful AL’s along with the vast 

majority of non-useful (random)  AL’s.  Here, we  present  a  practical  and  efficient  Fourier 

space-based general theory to identify all those AL’s having useful band properties, which 

are  characterized  by  well-defined  Fourier  (i.e.  lattice  momentum)  components.  Direct 

control of field localization comes via control of the Parseval strength competition between 

the different Fourier components characterizing a lattice. Real-space optimization of AL’s 

tends to be computationally demanding. However, via our Fourier space-based simulated 

annealing inverse optimization algorithm, we efficiently tailor the relative strength of the 

AL Fourier components for precise control of photonic band and localization properties.

1. Introduction 

In  the  design  of  photonic  crystals  used  in  photonic  integrated  circuits  and  dense 

wavelength  division  multiplexing  (DWDM)  systems,  increasing  importance  is  being  placed  on 

careful control of the transmission  characteristics, which derive from the device photonic band 

properties. One particular requirement is high transmission and high resolution operation. There 

is thus a high premium on the ability to engineer the band properties of a photonic crystal in a 

systematic  manner.  Photonic  crystals  [1]  are  usually  characterized  by  a  well-defined  lattice 

periodicity.  In  the  simplest  case,  for  a  periodic  1D  lattice,  where  the  wavelength  of  the 

electromagnetic (EM) radiation is twice the optical lattice constant (L

), Bragg-resonance occurs 

and  a  bandgap  forms  in  the  dispersion  characteristic,  which  results  in  a  dip  in  the  spectral 

transmission  characteristic,  but  no  useful  photon  localization.  In  order  to  achieve  field 

localization or fine tuning of the band properties, photonic bandgap (PBG) engineering [2,3] is 

needed, which requires breaking of the lattice periodicity thorough the introduction of single or 

multiple  defects  (missing  or  extra  scattering  sites)  [4-7].  In  real-space,  they  determine  the 

localized cavities storing energy at those defect sites. In general, when an EM field is localized in 

a  lattice-based  cavity,  the  associated  cavity  mode  provides  the  basis  for  useful  filtering 

functionality.  In  finite  lattices,  such  modes  couple  to  propagating  modes  to  appear  as  a 

dramatically  enhanced  transmission  in  comparison  with  other  frequencies  in  the  vicinity  [4]. 

Although  Bragg  resonances  are  responsible  for  determining  the  photon  propagation  through  a 

lattice, it is worth mentioning that fundamentally, such localization phenomena of the EM wave 

can also be related to Bragg resonances. 

Conventional  PBG  engineering  has  tended  to  be  based  mostly  on  a  ‘forward’  process  of 

defining  a  lattice  structure  and  then  determining  the  band  properties,  e.g.,  through  the  use  of 

 

3 

constraining  formulae  such  as  the  Fibonacci  or  Cantor-based  quasi-periodic  lattices  [8-10]; 

through  coupled-cavity  structures,  proposed  by  Yariv  et  al.  [6];  or  by  intuition  (accumulated 

design experience) and trial-and-error, such as the high-Q cavity structures reported by Akahane 

et  al.  [11].  There  has  also  been  a  growing  interest  in  the  ‘inverse’  process  of  determining 

appropriate aperiodic photonic lattices from the desired scattering properties (functionality) [12-

16]. With the exception of quasiperiodic lattices, which can form stop-bands considerably away 

from  the  conventional  Bragg  frequency,  these  techniques  modify  the  spectral  functionality 

mostly within or around the Bragg stop-band. Also, in most cases (both ‘forward’ and ‘inverse’) 

the underlying principle is the direct optimization of the band properties by characterization of 

the  lattices  in  real-space.  Even  for  a  moderate  number  of  scattering  sites  and  defects,  these 

methods become computationally extremely demanding and complex to generalise beyond 1D. 

While  PBG  engineering  renders  the  lattice  essentially  aperiodic  [17,18]  in  the  most  general 

sense,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  a  randomly  chosen  aperiodic  lattice  (AL)  will  have  any  useful 

field localization or band properties. Hence, the question is how to identify the relatively small 

number of useful AL’s (in terms of their band properties) from the very large number of possible 

AL’s?  

In this paper we present a general theory and systematic design tool to reveal a previously 

unknown  landscape  of  essentially  aperiodic  lattices,  which  show  useful  and  novel  spectral 

functionalities,  e.g.,  tuneable  bandgaps  and  multiple  localized  states.  Previous  theories  have 

discarded these useful AL’s along with the vast majority of non-useful (random) AL’s, because 

they  have  characterized  photonic  lattices  only  with  regular  periodicity  of  the  real  space  lattice. 

However, as we explain in our paper, we have adopted a Fourier-space (k-space) approach [19], 

where  AL’s  having  useful  band  properties  are  characterized  by  well-defined  spatial  frequency 

 

4 

(i.e.,  lattice  momentum)  components.  We  have  used  a  discrete  Fourier  transform  (DFT)-based 

inverse  optimization  algorithm  to  tailor  the  Fourier  components  of  an  AL  to  match  that  of  a 

“target”  function;  the  target  function,  also,  of  course,  being  defined  in  Fourier-space  and 

equating to the desired band properties. Overall, the entire scheme turns out to be more practical 

and  efficient  in  achieving  desired  and  controllable  photonic  band  functionality.  Indeed,  we 

demonstrate  that  AL’s  [20-23]  inherently  offer  the  most  flexible  platform  to  achieve  novel 

spectral functionalities. In this context, our method provides answers to questions such as: For a 

given  overall  length  and  lattice  constant  L

  of  a  1D  lattice,  what  are  the  various  defect 

combinations  that  produce  discontinuities  along  the  angular  frequency  w-axis corresponding to 

various  discrete  wavevector  points  between,  say,  kBR=  p/L 

(edge  of  the  Brillouin  zone)  and 

0.5kBR?  Or  more  importantly  in  the  context  of  optical  telecommunications,  e.g.,  DWDM 

components: What defect combinations for this lattice will provide localized photon states (i.e., 

high  photon  transmission)  at  desired  optical  frequencies,  useful  for  multi-wavelength 

narrowband  optical  filters  and  tuneable  semiconductor  lasers?  Although  some  of  the  resulting 

aperiodic structures may appear ‘intuitive’ and ‘expected’ from the optimisation algorithm, we 

emphasise  the  fact  that  the  scattering  positions  in  a  lattice  structure  are  subtly  balanced  to 

provide  both  the  requisite  photonic  bandgap  and  also  the  localised  states  within  that  bandgap. 

This  is  because  the  presence  of  a  bandgap  requires  the  appropriate  constructive  phase 

relationships  between  the  Fourier  components  of  the  lattice,  while  the  introduction  of  defects 

must  be  controlled  such  that  bandgap  impairment  is  minimised,  while  localised  states  appear 

both within that bandgap, but also with reasonable finesse. Hence, the resulting structures should 

not  be  considered  as  post-facto  ‘obvious’  or  ‘trivial’  results,  but  as  delicately  engineered 

optimised compromises.

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we establish a powerful link between PBG 

engineering and digital signal processing (DSP) to enable a Fourier transform (FT) based inverse 

optimization  process,  e.g.,  for  photon  localization.  In  section  3  we  present  the  mathematical 

framework  for  our  inverse  optimization  technique  using  simulated  annealing  (SA).  Section  4 

provides  results  and  discussions  for  shifting  the  photonic  bandgap  away  from  the  Bragg 

frequency, and for photon localization. Finally, in section 5 we present some conclusions. 

2. Photonic bandgap, EM wave localization and digital signal processing 

The  underlying  physics  behind  the  PBG  effect  and  EM  wave  localization  is  Bragg 

resonance between the wavevector k of EM radiation and lattice momentum G. In the simplest 

case  of  a  periodic  1D  lattice,  composed  of  layers  of  two  different  materials  with  geometric 

thicknesses,  H  and  L,  and  refractive  indices,  nH  and  nL,  respectively,  when  Bragg’s  law

  is  satisfied  for  a  photon  of  wavevector 

,  (with  Gˆ   the  unit  lattice

transmission through the structure about an angular frequency wBR (the Bragg frequency) given 

by

Fourier  component  at  an  optical  spatial  frequency  (momentum)  given  by

L =nHH+nLL  is  the  periodicity  in  optical  space.  In  our  paper,  real-space  and  reciprocal-space 

variables are all assumed the appropriate optical quantity [24] (i.e., optical space or path-length

 where l is geometric real-space, and optical reciprocal-space is given by 

(cid:242)=

),  unless  otherwise  stated.  It  is  widely  known  in  DSP  that  the  DFT  of  a  real  series 

produces a symmetric amplitude spectrum about the highest sampling frequency (known as the 

Nyquist  frequency).  This  principle,  taken  together  with  the  symmetry  observed  in  the  spectral

responses  of  1D  quasiperiodic  superlattices  [9],  suggests  that  the  scattering  sites  of  any  real-

space  AL  can  be  regarded  as  samples  with  a  spatial  frequency  less  than  the  highest  spatial 

frequency GBR (the Nyquist frequency). Hence, the FT of an AL defined by a set of scattering 

sites {xp} will give a set of spatial frequency components {Gq} that forms a symmetric spectrum 

about  the  highest  spatial  frequency  GBR,  where  the  lattice  reciprocal-space  variable  G  is  the 

Fourier  conjugate  to  the  real-space  variable  x.  Generalising  the  Bragg  resonance  condition 

between all of these spatial frequency components {Gq} and the set of EM angular frequencies

characteristic for EM wave propagation through the AL, indicated in Fig. 1. The strength of the

We  note  that  the  localization  of  the  EM  wave  is  determined  by  those  wavevectors  of  the  EM 

wave  spectrum,  which  have  their  Bragg  resonating  partner  in  the  Fourier  spectrum  of  the 

scattering dielectric function. Localization of the EM wave inside a lattice can be thought of as 

originating  from  the  interaction  of  different  Bragg  resonances,  i.e.,  those  finite  Fourier 

components  characterising  the  lattice.  Multiple  Bragg  resonances  can  therefore  be  used  as  the 

basis  of  controlling  EM  localization  in  a  fashion  not  available  from  a  conventional  periodic 

lattice  (which  exhibits  only  a  single  Bragg  resonance).  The  FT-basis  of  the  localization 

phenomenon, as qualitatively outlined above, allows us the additional benefit of exploiting DSP 

techniques,  as  explained  above.  A  DFT  of  a  (purely-real)  distribution  produces  a  symmetric 

Fourier spectrum about GBR, where each component is responsible for a Bragg resonance. Due to 

considerations of power conservation (i.e., Parseval’s theorem), the wave localization properties 

 

7 

of  the  lattice  are  determined  by  the  strength  competition  between  those  Fourier  components. 

Overall, this is an initial clue that the transmission characteristic of a photonic lattice is closely 

related  to  its  spectral-distribution  characteristics,  i.e.,  the  FT  of  its  real-space  structure 

(equivalent to the first Born approximation [25]). This FT link is the basis of our inverse design 

approach. 

3. Inverse optimization 

For  mathematical  convenience,  the  following  DFT-based  inverse  analysis  has  been 

conducted in 1D only. However, we note that since the analysis is FT-based, it can be extended 

to higher-dimension photonic lattices. We consider a binary relative permittivity lattice structure

 of N sites located at the set of positions {xp} in optical space. Each site is 

taken  to  be  either  nH  or  nL,  of  respective  geometric  thicknesses,  H  and  L.  We  use

binary lattice function (analogous to the Bravais lattice function for a periodic structure), where 

fp=+1  equates  to  a  high  refractive  index  nH,  and fp  = - 1  to  the  low  refractive  index  nL,  so  that 

defects  inside  the  lattice  can  be  controlled  simply  by  manipulating  the  polarity  fp  of  any 

individual site. Consider an arbitrary hth configuration of the photonic lattice denoted by eh{xp}.

for the following  analysis is sufficient due  to the symmetric redundancy in the spectrum about 

the  Nyquist  frequency,  discussed  above.  We  can  tailor  the  Fourier  components  distribution, 

given  by  Eqs.  (1)  and  (2)  according  to  our  need,  and  a  subsequent  inverse  FT  will  generate  a 

real-space  lattice  configuration.  Various  band  properties,  e.g.,  the  strength  of  bandgaps  or 

localized  states,  depend  only  on  the  amplitude  of  the  associated  Fourier  component,  with  the 

phase characteristic, therefore, being a degree of freedom (i.e., arbitrary). This makes the inverse 

calculation analogous to the calculation of a computer-generated hologram (CGH) [26], with the 

formidable computational challenge of identifying those purely real CGH solutions from within 

the  factorially-large  search  space.  We  use  a  non-deterministic  simulated  annealing  (SA) 

optimization algorithm to search this configuration space. By controlling the defects in the lattice

each  is  close  to  an  overall  global  optimum  in  cost-space.  From  a  practical  point  of  view,  the 

functionality of these solutions tends to be indistinguishable. As part of the design process, the

size  of  the  lattice,  with  G  existing  in  a  quasi-continuous  space  as  N  tends  to  infinity.  Having 

generated  an  AL,  we  check  that  its  transmission  properties  (i.e.,  band  properties)  are  in 

agreement with the desired transmission characteristics. Conventional methods for this forward 

determination  of  the  transmission  characteristics  of  an  AL  use  either  transfer  matrix  (TM) 

methods,  finite-difference  time-domain  (FDTD)  approaches,  or  eigen-mode  expansion  (EME) 

techniques. However, we use the Fourier transform Eq. (4), which has been derived in Ref. [24] 

by  solving  the  Ricatti  equation  for  the  scattering  coefficient  between  a  pair  of  forward-  and 

backward-propagating  coupled-modes,  for  quick  and  efficient  (yet  reasonably  accurate) 

calculation of the transmission characteristics of our AL’s.

4. Results and discussions 

Having designed an AL, a commercial software package (FIMMPROP-3D) [27] was used 

to verify the performance of the resulting AL. The aperiodic binary photonic bandgap lattice was 

assumed to be realised in a rib-type waveguide by implementing the required changes in relative 

permittivity through binary modulation of the waveguide width. The effective refractive indices 

of  the  fundamental  mode  in  the  two  widths  of  the  waveguide  were  found  to  be  nH=2.6  and 

nL=2.42,  respectively.  The  optical  path  length  for  each  waveguide-section  was  chosen  to  be  a 

quarter Bragg-wavelength, with the Bragg wavelength lBR =1550nm, so that the two geometric 

lengths  are  H=lBR/4nH  » 149nm  and  L=lBR/4nL  » 160nm.  This  gives  the  smallest  geometric 

spatial period in the lattice as L

¢ = H + L = 309nm (i.e., L=  nHH+ nLL= 775nm in optical space). 

Employing N=112 unit-cells, with the normalised DFT Nyquist frequency (GBR) corresponding 

to  N/2 = 56,  we have 28 discrete points (indexed by the DFT variable q) between the edge of 

the Brillouin  zone (corresponding to  kBR, q=56)  and  0.5kBR, where q=28.  To  illustrate  this,  we 

present results for the first five points corresponding to q=56,55,54,53, and 52, respectively. We 

emphasize,  though,  that  the  lattice  can  be  designed  to  exhibit  a  stop  band  ‘on  demand’  at  any 

position corresponding to q=1 through to q=56; however, space constraints allow us to show in 

Fig. 2 (i-v) only examples for the first five positions (the corresponding lattice configurations are 

presented in Table I). Figure 2(i) shows the spectrum for a conventional periodic lattice with a 

bandgap at the edge of the Brillouin zone (i.e., q=56). Transmission characteristics in Fig. 2 (ii-v) 

show the symmetric photonic stop gaps being shifted in incremental steps of about 0.02fBR, (i.e., 

2fBR/N)  away  from  the  Brillouin  zone  edge,  by  using  defects  in  well-defined  locations  in  the 

photonic  lattice.  We  also  note  the  occurrence  of  resonant  peaks  between  the  two  symmetric 

photonic  stop  bands.  These  resonant  peaks  form  as  a  result  of  interference  of  different  Bragg 

 

11 

stop-bands, i.e., those Fourier components which make the lattice. Precise control of these peaks, 

important for DWDM components (e.g., when realised within the cavity of a semiconductor laser 

to enable tuning [28]) thus requires tailoring of the relative strength of the different Bragg stop-

bands. An important example is the so-called single-defect (0.5L

) Fabry-Perot-type lattice [29] 

(used in a quarter-wave shifted DFB laser), corresponding to the q=55 AL. The high-frequency 

band-edge  transmission  peak  of  the  lower  bandgap  (at  0.98fBR),  and  the  low-frequency  band-

edge transmission peak of the upper bandgap (at 1.02fBR) overlap to form a single, very narrow 

resonant (localized) transmission peak at the Bragg frequency. In the example spectra of Fig. 2 

(ii-v)  we  haven’t  tried  controlling  these  peaks,  as  the  intention  is  more  to  demonstrate  the 

controlled  tunability  of  Bragg  stop-bands.  By  introducing  ever  more  defects,  Fig.  2  shows  a 

progression  from  a  periodic  to  ever-more  aperiodic  lattices,  with  the  bandgap  being  shifted 

further away from the Brillouin zone edge. In so doing, the number of scatterers is reduced, so 

that the overall bandgap strength is reduced, but we note that we can straightforwardly increase 

the PBG bandgap strength again by simply increasing N, or the refractive index contrast D e. 

As  a  design  example  of  an  aperiodic  lattice,  with  precisely  defined  wave  localization 

properties, we have chosen to modify the spectral response, reported in Foresi et al. [4], from a 

single  resonant  high-Q  defect  state  to  a  doubly  resonant  system  with  two  high-Q  defect  states 

within a wide photonic stop band. In order to achieve this modification in the same system, we 

need  to  identify  a  real-space  lattice  with  two  properties;  first,  the  lattice  must  have  the  same 

number (eight) of refractive index contrast elements (e.g., etched air holes in a Si-waveguide), 

i.e., N=16; second, the length of any defect is 0.5L.

 We also used silicon-silicon dioxide as our 

material system, which provides a sufficiently large contrast (the refractive index difference D n 

is  about  2)  so  that  the  optical  wave  is  strongly  confined.  The  waveguide  cross-section  can, 

 

12 

therefore, also be made very small (in this case 0.5 m m wide and 0.26 m m thick), which is useful 

in  microphotonic  integrated  circuits  at  optical  telecommunication  wavelengths  requiring 

microscale optical elements. The resulting device transmissivities in Fig. 3 were simulated using 

FIMMPROP-3D, discussed previously. 

Figure 3 (i-b) shows the DFT spectrum for the single defect lattice shown in Fig. 3 (i-a), 

which produces a single high-Q resonant state within the photonic stop band, as seen in Fig. 3 (i-

c). The Fourier amplitude is zero at the Nyquist frequency point GBR, with the strongest Fourier 

components  existing  at  the  neighbouring  Fourier  positions,  calculated  as  0.875GBR  with  its 

symmetric  partner  at  1.125GBR.  The  Bragg  resonances,  which  originate  from  these  main  two 

Fourier  components,  interfere  to  form  a  very  narrow  (i.e.,  high-Q)  transmission  peak  at  the 

conventional Bragg frequency fBR, i.e., a Fabry-Perot mode equivalent to Fig. 2 (ii). Figure 3 (ii) 

and  (iii)  show  the  DFT  responses  and  the  spectral  transmission  characteristics  of  two  further 

lattices doped with multiple defects. The defects control the strength of the Fourier component at 

the Nyquist frequency, and, hence, the transmissivity at the Bragg-frequency. In accordance with 

Parseval’s  theorem,  we  note  that  the  Fourier  component  at  GBR  in  Fig.  3  (ii-b)  and  (iii-b) 

strengthens at the cost of the component amplitudes of the neighbouring Fourier locations. The 

strengths of the Fourier components (i.e., closely equivalent to reflection coefficients) determine 

the finesses associated with the two resonant peaks, and combined with cavity losses (e.g., lattice 

absorption,  diffractive  radiation)  control  the  overall  Q-values  of  the  peaks.  By  inspection,  the 

individual resonances in Fig. 3 (ii-c) and (iii-c) have lower finesses (and, hence, Q-values) than 

the  single  resonant  peak  of  Fig.  3  (i-c).  Figure  3  (iv-a)  shows  an  AL  forming  two  high-Q 

transmission  peaks.  With  two  defects  of  size  d=0.5L,

  the  two  resonating  defect  states  appear 

deep  within  the  stop  band  at  frequencies  0.92  fBR  and  1.05  fBR  (the  asymmetry  apparent  with 

 

13 

respect  to  the  Bragg  frequency  being  due  to  the  additional  lattice  material  dispersion  as 

calculated by FIMMPROP-3D). Evident are the higher finesses of the peaks of Fig. 3 (iv-c) as 

compared  with  Fig.  3  (ii-c)  and  (iii-c).  We  also  observe  an  interesting  inverse  relationship 

between the relative distance separating the spatial defects, and the frequency distance between 

the  resulting  resonating  peaks.  Such  behaviour  is perhaps to be  expected, due to the reciprocal 

symmetries  between  the  FT  conjugate  planes.  The  simulated  field  intensity  patterns  in  the  xy-

plane corresponding to these modes and at the Bragg frequency have been plotted in Fig. 4. At 

the  resonating  frequencies  each  defect  site  acts  as  a  cavity,  where  the  electromagnetic  wave  is 

spatially  localized.  However,  the  evanescent  tail  of  each  mode  can  overlap  and  couple  to  the 

propagating  modes  resulting  in  an  enhanced  transmission  for  the  corresponding  resonant 

frequency. It also can be seen from Fig. 4., that although the spatial field distributions for both 

frequencies show maxima at the defect regions, there is a node between the defects for the low 

frequency resonance (Fig. 4 (a)). As might be expected, the symmetries exhibited by the spatial 

field  distributions  at  the  resonating  frequencies  have  a  close  analogy  with  the  bonding  and 

antibonding wavefunctions well-known in  solidstate  physics.  At  the  Bragg  frequency, the high 

intensity  of  light  entering  from  the  left,  but  being  reflected  (i.e.,  not  allowed  to  propagate)  is 

clearly evident. 

5. Conclusions 

In  conclusion,  we  have  presented  a  Fourier-space  based  design  approach  for  systematic 

control of the photonic band properties and the number of resonant states within a photonic stop 

band  using  aperiodic  lattices.  Using  a  simulated  annealing  optimisation  algorithm,  we  have 

demonstrated  that  we  can  manipulate  the  Fourier  components  (constrained  by  Parseval’s 

theorem)  of  an  AL,  to  inverse  design  and  engineer  any  desired  bandgap  and  field  localization 

 

14 

characteristic. Our theory takes advantage of the analogies between PBG engineering and DSP, 

both underpinned with a common FFT formalism, to enable a computationally efficient inverse 

design methodology. Overall, in addition to the design of DWDM components, we believe this 

work  will  help  PBG  engineering  find  new  applications,  for  example,  with  multiple  defects 

introduced  into  a  3D  photonic  crystal  fabricated  using  holographic  lithography  [30].

Figure  2.  Optical  transmission  spectra  (transmission  t  versus  normalized  frequency  f/fBR), 

calculated  using  FIMMPROP-3D.  Figures  (i-v)  show  use  of  AL’s  to  shift  the  PBG  into  the 

Brillouin Zone in steps of ~0.02fBR from the edge of the Bragg frequency fBR.

Fig.3.The  Fourier  component  distributions  and  spectral  transmission  characteristics  of  four 

different  aperiodic  lattices  doped  with  defects.  We  have  used  N=16  unit-cells,  with  the 
normalised DFT Nyquist frequency (GBR) corresponding to q=N/2 = 8. Evident is the systematic 

progression from a single high-Q transmission peak to double high-Q transmission peaks.

FIG.  1:  Qualitative  understanding  of  how  we  can  combine  simple  rules  of  DSP  with  Bragg’s 

Law, in order to predict the position of the dips in the electromagnetic transmission spectrum of 

any real AL. 

Figure  2.  Optical  transmission  spectra  (transmission  t  versus  normalized  frequency  f/fBR), 

calculated  using  FIMMPROP-3D.  Figures  (i-v)  show  use  of  AL’s  to  shift  the  PBG  into  the 

Brillouin Zone in steps of ~0.02fBR from the edge of the Bragg frequency fBR.

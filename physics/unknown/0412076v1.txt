Abstract: The  effects  of the exposure  of  the  bacterium, Leptospira interrogans

serovar canicola  to  a  constant  magnetic  field  with magnetic  flux  density  from  a

permanent ferrite magnet = 140±5 mT  were stud ied.  Changes in Leptospira cells after

their  exposure  to  the  field  were  determined  on  the  basis  of  changes  in  their  growth

behavior and agglutination immunoreactivity with a homologous antiserum using dark-

field  microscopy  together  with  visual  imaging.    The  data  showed  that  the  exposed 

Leptospira  cells have lower densities and  lower agglutination  immunoreactivity than 

the unexposed  control  group.  Interestingly,  some  of  the  exposed Leptospira  cells 

showed  abnormal  morphologies  such  as  large  lengths.  We  discussed  some  of  the 

possible reasons for these observations.

INTRODUCTION

Leptospirosis is an acute febrile illness caused by pathogenic spirochete bacteria 

of the genus  Leptospira (1, 2).  This disease has emerged as an important public health 

problem  worldwide.    The symptoms  of  this  disease  can  range from  mild-flu- like

symptoms  to  severe  (often  fatal)    complications  such  as  renal  and/or  liver  failure  and 

hemorrhage  (referred to as Weil’s syndrome) (3).  Most outbreaks tend to be seasonal 

in nature and are often  associated with environmental factors,  animals, and agricultural 

and occupational cycles such as rice cultivation in marshy lands.  Mammals such as rats 

and  cattle  are  commonly  involved  in  the  transmission  of  this  disease  to  humans  via 

direct  or  indirect  exposure  to  contaminated  tissues  or  urine  (1,  2, 4).    Out-breaks of 

leptospirosis  occur  mainly  after  flood,  making it an  occupational  hazard  for  sanitary 

and  agricultural  workers,  as  well  as  a recreational  hazard  for  humans  (5).  Some 

pathogenic  leptospira species have also been found to be associated with domesticated

animals.  For  example,  serovar  canicola  (Leptospira  canicola)  has  adapted  itself  to 

canines;  therefore,  it  has  become  common  in  many  human  communities.  Although

there has been no report of leptospirosis in canines in Thailand, there  is a great potential 

for the transmission  of  the  disease  between  humans  and  dogs  kept  as  household  pets, 

unless one is aware of the disease.

L. canicola cells used in our study are motile aerobes that are very thin, flexible 

and  spiral-shaped  of  about  0.1  µm  width  and  6-20  µm  length. Leptospira  cells  are 

difficult to observe under a light microscope.  They can, however, be observed by dark-

field microscopy  using wet samples. This allows for the  determination of  agglutination

TRIAMPO ET AL.

immunoreactivity  to  be  determined.    The  leptospiral  outer  membrane  or  surface

antigens can be detected through its agglutination with a homologous  [antiserum]. The 

optimal  conditions  for  its  growth  and  as  well,  its  biology  are  well  documented  in  the 

literature (1, 2).  Moist environments with a neutral pH  are suitable conditions for the

survival  of  leptospira  outside  the  host.    The optimal cultivation  temperature  is

approximately  20-32°C.      In  general, Leptospira  species  are  highly  susceptible  to 

adverse environmental conditions  such  as  exposure  to  dry  air,  chemicals such  as

chlorine or 

iodine in detergents,  unfavorable  pH (  >  8.0  or  <  6.5),  strong

electromagnetic fields and high temperatures (above 40°C). 

Magnetic  fields  (MFs)  also  affect  various  biological  functions  of  living

organisms,  for  example, DNA  synthesis  and  transcription  (6),  as  well  as  ion

transportation through cell membranes  (7).  Almost all living organisms are exposed to

magnetic fields from various sources. The geomagnetic field on the surface of the earth 

is approximately 0.50-0.75 gauss in strength.   There have been several studies on the 

effects of exposure to  MFs  and  several  of  these  have  given  rise  to  controversies over 

the  past  decades.  The  growth  rate  of  the  Burgundy  wine  yeast  has  been  shown  to 

decrease when an extremely low magnetic flux density (MFD) of 4 gauss is applied (8).

The growth of  Trichomonas  vaginalis  is  accelerated  when  it  is  exposed  to  460-1200

gauss (9).   The growth  rate of Bacillus  subtilis increases when exposed to 150 gauss 

and decreases when exposed to more than 300 gauss (10).  Similar results were reported 

for Chlorella; an exposure of less than 400 gauss increases the growth, while exposure 

to 580 gauss decreases the growth rate (11). Several studies point to the MF as a factor

influencing the growth and survival of  living organisms, which  vary at different MFDs

TRIAMPO ET AL.

(12, 13, 14, 15).  Other researchers  have studied the effects of MFs on  bacteria at the 

enzyme (16) or genetic (17) level.

To study the efficacy of using magnetic field to control or prevent the growth of 

Leptospira,  we  applied  MF  on  selected  Leptospira cells  at  various  intensities  and

exposure  duration levels.    We then  determined  the  agglutinating  activity of

experimental bacteria using dark field microscopy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Pathogenic Leptospira interrogans,  serovar  canicola was used  in this study.

Bacteria l cells were  grown  in  the Ellinghausen and McCullough modified by Johnson 

and Harris [EMJH]  liquid  medium (2). The bacterial cells were grown at a temperature

of 27±1°C in the dark.

A cylindrical permanent ferrite magnet  5 cm in diameter  was placed beside  15

ml  culture  glass  tube (less than  1 ml  apart)  containing  1  ml  of  a  suspension  of  newly 

subcultured  leptospira  cells  in  the  EMJH  liquid  medium. MF  and  homogeneity of 

140 –

5

 mT (northpole) were checked using a teslameter (Hall effect Teslameter digital, 

order no.  13610.93;  Phywe  Systeme Gottingen,  Germany).    The  intensity  of  static 

magnetic  field  used  in  our  experiments  was  chosen  on  the  basis  of  Genkov  et  al.  (9) 

findings.  Genkov et al. had used  more or less  this intensity of a constant MF to induce 

the growth and development of Trichomanas vaginalis. For this type of  exposure,  no 

shielding  against  the  natural  variations  of  terrestrial  MF  was  required,  the  value  of 

approximately  0.050  mT is  negligible  with  respect  to  the  MF  intensities  applied.  An

TRIAMPO ET AL.

6

experiment using cells not exposed to MF was simultaneously performed as the control,

which was placed at a distance of about 100 cm from the exposed group.

  In  the  absence  of  magnets,  MFD  was  0.05±0.01  mT.    All  bacterial  samples

were exposed to MF for different durations, that is, 0 (control sample), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 

6 d.    After  MF exposure,  individual  samples were  further  incubated for 7  d.

Immediately after 7 days of incubation, dark- field micrographs were taken using a CCD 

camera to observe cell development.  The growth and agglutination properties using the 

microscopy  agglutination 

test 

(MAT)  with

a

homologous  antiserum  and

immunoreactivity were scored as follows:

4+ = 100 % absence of Leptospira cells from the field 

3+ =  75 % absence of Leptospira cells from the field

2+ =  50% absence of Leptospira cells from the field

1+ =  25% absence of Leptospira cells from the field

stet

repeated twice.

MAT has been  commonly used as a diagnostic tool for leptospirosis. This may not be 

the most reliable  test. It,  however, is arguably the most appropriate test  for  this  study.

The same  set  of conditions and specimens  were  used  in  the  experiment s,  which  were

microscopy (SPM) (Digital Instruments Veeco Metrology Group, New York, USA)

was used for AFM surface morphology imaging. Images were acquired in the contact 

mode showing height contours that highlight the spiral shape and fine surface 

morphology of Leptospira cells. An AFM scanner with hardware correction for the

nonlinearities of the piezoelectric element was used. The scanner has a maximum xy 

range of 125 by 125 µm and a z range of 6µm. The cantilevers of Si3N4, 125 µm long 

and 35 µm wide with a spring constant of 0.58 Nm-1 were used. To locate the area of 

interest in the samples and identify any bacteria, we used a built- in long-range on-axis

microscope, capable of a 5:1 zoom and x 3,500 magnification.  Imaging was carried out 

at scan speeds between 1 and 50 µm/s. Images were acquired at 256x256 pixels.  A 

typical imaging session began using a built- in optical microscope and by moving the x-

y table to search for bacterial cells. The AFM cantilever was then moved forward to the 

surface close to the chosen bacterial cell.

Each sample was prepared using the method described above. It was then

dropped on a microscope glass slide and dried in air. 

RESULTS

Figure 1 shows the AFM picture of a L. interrogans serovar canicola cell taken 

with a Digital Instrument Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Instruments Veeco Metrology Group, 

New  York,  USA) in  the  contact  mode.  The  image shows  a  normal  morphology  of L.

interrogans  serovar  canicola,  that  is,  the  spiral shape.    It  is  worth  noting  that  AFM 

usually reveals  the  actual  roughness  of  the  surface  of  the  bacteria l  envelope. Other

types  of  microscopy  frequently  show  the  surface  to  be  relatively  smooth.    This

TRIAMPO ET AL.

8

technique was also used to observe the surface morphology of bacterial cells before and 

after the exposure to MF. It should be noted that  this  image does not demonstrate the

rough envelope very clearly. However, it does show the normal bacterial morphology.

Figure 1

Figure 2 shows  some  representative  dark field  micrographs  of  L.  interrogans 

serovar  canicola  taken  at  the logarithmic  growth  phase  (at 1:10 dilution  of  culture 

samples) and for different durations of MF exposure, that is, 0, 2, 3, and 6 d.  After 7 d

of  incubation,  the  samples were observed under  a  dark  field  microscope  and  images

were taken using a CCD camera.  Even though there are some noises in the images, the

inhibition of cell growth could be observed.  The implications of these observations are 

significant  given  the  results  of  other  studies(6-17).   From  Figs.  2A  to  2D,  one  can 

clearly observe that  cell density decreased with exposure time, particularly after more

than    3  d.  This  indicates  the  decrease  in  growth  rate  resulting  in  the  decrease in the 

number of bacterial cells. This is  one of the factors that  explain the  lower agglutination

immunoreactivity,  which  is there  were fewer remaining  living  bacteria l  cells  to

agglutinate.

Figure 3  shows the dark field micrographs of agglutinated bacteria l cells after 

reacting  with  the specific  antiserum;  Fig.3A shows a  complete  agglutination  (100% 

immuno) and Fig.3B  shows  50%  agglutination  (with  only  one half  of  free- living

bacterial cells present).

On  the  basis  of  the  criteria  mentioned  at  the  end  of  the  previous  section,  the

agglutination reactivities of the  L.  interrogans  serovar  canicola exposed  to  different 

intensities  of  MF  are  listed  in  Table 1  (with longer  exposure  time,  the  leptospiral

bacterial  cells  demonstrated  a  lower  agglutination immunoreactivity  than  that  of the

reference  antiserum  tested.  The  end  point  of  reactivity  was  50%  agglutination  (2+)).

The agglutination immunoreactivity score decreased  with  exposure  time of  Lectospire

cells as shown  in Fig 4.  Comparing the MAT results  of control Leptospire cells  (0 d

exposure)  and  those  of  bacteria l  cells after  exposed to  MF,  we  found  that  the  latter 

groups (particularly those with longer exposure) showed lower agglutination reactivies.

These  findings  may indicate  the  presence  of  a  lower  amount  of  agglutinin  or  number

(density)  of Leptospires cells in the exposed samples  than  in  the  control  samples.  It 

should be emphasized that the same set of conditions and specimens   were  used  in the 

experiments that  were  repeated  twice,  and  the  experiments  yields  exactly  the  same

(semiquantitative) results. The scoring data therefore did not show  an error. Once again, 

each experimental setup, it has one control (nonexposed) group and six exposed groups 

with different durations of exposure.

Figure 4

Besides the  decrease  in  the  number  of  Leptospira  cells as  the  cause  of  the 

decrease in agglutination immunoreactivity as mentioned above, the “denaturing effect”

of

the antigen-antibody  reaction  may  be an  other  contributing  factor  to  this

phenomenon, which can be explained as follows: Typically, antibodies are large soluble 

TRIAMPO ET AL.

10

protein molecules known as immunoglobins and are produced by B-cells.  They bind to 

specific antigens in a lock-and-key fashion (lock = antibody; key = antigen) (18). Their

shape  should,  therefore,  be  specific  to  particular  antigens.    Whe n a  specific  antibody 

encounters an  antigen,  it  will  form  an  antigen-antibody  complex  through  some

noncovalent  forces  such  as  electrostatic  force,  hydrogen  bond,  van  der  Waal  force  or

hydrophobic force.  When a change  in what of a single atom occurs, the complex can 

become  unbound.    This  specificity could be the  underlying  factor for  the denaturation

of the antigen-antibody reaction.  Under the conditions used in the study, the motion or 

transfer  of  any  electrons  or  ions onto  the  cell  membrane  could  induce  an  electric 

current.    This  current  may  perturb  the  other  charge  particle  motion  in  the  cell  thus 

resulting in the loss of binding  (19).

Figure 5

Surprisingly,  we  observed  that  some Leptospira  cells  exposed  for  3  or  more

days were  longer than the control bacterial cells (see Fig. 5). This preliminary finding 

probably  indicates  that  there  is  some  disturbance  in  cell  division.    More  experiments 

must be  carried  out to  examine and  determine  the  exact  mechanism  underlying these

observed phenomena. Our  present  explanation  for  this  abnormality  in  cell  division  is 

based  on  the  following:    Like  most bacteria  and  archaea, Leptospira  cells  divide 

symmetrically  possibly  via  the  formation  of  a  septum  in  the  middle  of  the  cell  (we

consider  that  binary  fission  is  less  likely).  For  the  time  being,  we  use  AFM  in  the

investigation of  division-related morphologies.  Recent   evidence 

indicates

that

synthesized proteins  dedicated  to  cell  division are  assembled  between  segregated 

chromosomes at an appropriate time (20).  The key to this  assembly is  the filamentous 

TRIAMPO ET AL.

11

temperature exposure sensitive (Ftsz structural) analogue of tubulin (21). DNA damage 

caused by MF  exposure induces  mutation,  resulting in the abnormal synthesis of  FtsZ,

which  in turn could  interfere  or  stop  cell  division.  Similar  to previous  studies  of

Escherichia  coli, FtsZ  appears  to  induce  the  earliest  (known)  step  in  cell  division. 

E.coli  cells  with  a  mutation  of  ftsz  caused  by  exposure  to  certain  conditions  do  not 

divide.    This  result  in  the  formation  of  long  filamentous  cells  that  can  replicate  and 

segregate their chromosomes (22).

Our  finding  is  at  least  the  first  step  toward  a  grater  understanding  of  this  the 

development  of  diagnostics,  treatment,  and      prevention  schemes  for  bacterium  and 

leptospirosis.  We  hope  that  further  studies  of  leptospirosis  will  lead  to  this  disease  in 

the near future.

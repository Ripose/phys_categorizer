Abstract 
 
The  recent  demonstration  that  nanoparticles  associated  with  various  biological 
molecules  and  pharmacological  agents  can  be  administered  systemically  to 
humans, without toxicity from the particles, has opened a new era in the targeting 
of  such  particles  to  specific  tissues  in  the  body  for  the  imaging  and  therapy  of 
disease.    The  majority  of  particles  used  for  this  purpose  contain  iron  and  are 
detected  in  the  body  by  magnetic  resonance  imaging. 
  We  believe  a 
superconducting  quantum 
(SQUID)  could  provide  
interference  device 
quantitative and spatial information relevant to localization of superparamagnetic 
nanoparticles directed to a specific cell target in vivo.  We envision a  scanning 
system  consisting  of  a  DC  induction  field,  a  transport  device,  and  an  array  of  
planar  first  order  gradiometer  coils  coupled  to  DC  SQUID  amplifiers.  We 
performed a set of computer simulations using experimentally determined values 
for concentrations of paramagnetic particles achievable in specific tissues of the 
mouse    in  vivo  and  concentrations  of  particles  linked  to  monoclonal  antibodies 
specific  to  antigens  of  two  human  cancer  cell  lines  in  vitro.  An  instrument  to 
target  distance  of  10  centimeters  was  selected  so  that  for  an  average  adult 
scanning both the anterior and posterior surfaces could provide coverage of most 
of the body. The simulations demonstrate the feasibility of SQUID magnetometry 
for  monitoring  achievable  concentrations  of  superparamagnetic  particles  in  vivo 
and raise the possibility of using this approach to detect and localize collections of 
abnormal cells targeted by such particles.

Introduction 
 
 
Diagnosis  of  cancers  at  an  early  stage  of  development  allowing  complete 
surgical  removal  remains  the  most  effective  means  of  curing  these  diseases 
despite  intensive  efforts  for  half  a  century  to  develop  curative  pharmacologic 
regimens.   Technological advances in imaging of abnormal structural features in 
organs  has  led  to  more  effective  methods  for  population  screening  for  cancers 
but  the  successes  are  vastly  outnumbered  by  the  failures.    For  example,  the 
overall  cure  rate  for  breast  cancer  in  the  United  States  is  about  85%  because 
there  are  effective  if  imperfect  methods  for  early  detection  e.g.  mammography 
and physical examination.  However, for a tumor such as ovarian cancer, which 
produces  few  symptoms  until  it  has  spread  regionally  and  for  which  there  is  no 
satisfactory method for population screening, the overall cure rate is about 35%.  
Detected  at  an  early  stage,  usually  by  chance,  ovarian  cancer  is  almost  100  % 
curable. 
 
Thus, much cancer research has concentrated on developing better methods for 
detecting  the  presence  of  the  disease  at  an  early  stage  with  a  low  cost  non-
invasive  technique  suitable  for  population  screening1.  The  most  widely  used 
methods for cancer imaging include plain x-ray with or without contrast medium, 
(MRI), 
(CT),  magnetic 
x-ray  computed 
ultrasound, and positron emission tomography (PET). The most precise imaging 
techniques, MRI, PET, and CT are expensive and prohibitively so for large scale 
screening for cancer.  
 
Over  the  past  decade,  there  have  been  many  attempts  to  develop  non-toxic 
reagents that target abnormal collections of cells and which can be detected by a 
non-invasive  procedure.    One  of  the  most  promising  approaches  is  the  use  of 
superparamagnetic  nanoparticles  (spnps)  that  are  either  actively  concentrated 
into  tissue  such  as  lymph  nodes,  often  the  first  site  of  cancer  spread,  or  which 
are directed selectively to specific cell types by targeting molecules bound to the 
surface of the particles.    
 
 
Superparamagnetic  nanoparticles,  consisting  usually  of 
iron  oxide  cores 
surrounded by dextran, are remarkably non-toxic in vivo in animals and humans.  
Thus,  spnps  linked  to  monoclonal  antibodies  with  specificity  to  unique  or 
overexpressed  surface  antigens  have  been  used  extensively  to  purify  bone 
marrow  stem  cells  constituting  0.1%  or  less  of  the  total  cell  population,  from 
unprocessed samples of human bone marrow. The antibodies cling to stem cell 
allowing  their  isolation  from  the  mass  of  cellular  material  by  magnetic  column 
chromatography.    The  particles  neither  impair  the  ability  of  these  stem  cells  to 
reconstitute the marrow of a leukemia patient nor do the particles appear to have 
any other toxic effects in humans.

Linking peptide sequences of the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus-
type 1 (HIV-1) particles can enhance the uptake of spnps into specific cell types.  
Using  this  approach,  Lewin  et  al2  showed  concentrations  of  10  to  30  pg  of 
superparamagnetic iron (0.5-2x107 nanoparticles/cell) could be incorporated into 
several types of human and mouse cells.  The particles did not affect cell viability 
and human bone marrow progenitor cells (CD34+ ) homed to the bone marrow in 
immunodeficient  mice.    Individual  cells  loaded  with  spnps  could  be  detected  as 
signal  voids  in  MRI  images  and  the  presence  of  spnps  in  specific  organs  eg, 
liver,  were  readily  detected  in  vivo  by  a  reduction  in  MRI  signal  intensity,  in  the 
environment of the particles. 
 
A striking demonstration of the safety and potential value of spnps in detection of 
prostate  cancer  metastatic  to  pelvic  lymph  nodes  was  reported  recently  by 
Harisinghani et al3 .  They administered spnps at a dose of 2.6 mg per kilogram 
of body weight to eighty patients with various clinical stages of prostate cancer.  
The  particles  concentrate  in  lymph  nodes  as  one  of  a  few  preferential  sites  of 
tissue  localization.    By  performing  MRI  before  and  after  particle  administration, 
90.5  %  of  nodes  found  to  have  metastatic  cancer    (documented  histologically 
after  surgical  resection  or  biopsy)  after  spnps  compared  to  only  35.4  percent 
detection  by  standard  MRI  (before  spnps).      The  basis  for  enhanced  detection 
was  distortion  of  the  plain  MRI  image  by  the  non-uniform  suppression  of  the 
intensity of the T2 signal by spnps irregularly distributed in lymph nodes infiltrated 
by cancer cells. 
 
A  more  direct  method  to  capitalize  on  the  magnetic  susceptibility  of  spnps  for 
cancer  therapy  is  in  development.    Iron  oxide  particles  bound  to  cancer 
chemotherapeutic  agents  are  injected  intraaterially and drawn through the walls 
of  capillaries  into  the  site  of  a  cancer  by  an  external  magnet  placed  over  the 
target  site4.  A  clinical  Phase  I/II  trial  was  recently  completed  in  which  the  anti-
cancer  drug  doxorubicin  absorbed  onto  microparticles  was  magnetically 
concentrated  in  the  liver  of  patients  with  unresectable  hepatocellular  cancer.  
Concentrations  of  the  drug  at  the  target  were  not  measured  in  patients  but 
localization  of  the  drug  in  the  liver,  caused  by  the  by  the  magnet  field,  was 
assumed  because  of  little  doxorubicin  in  the  systemic  circulation.  Evaluation  of 
the  therapeutic  benefit  of  this  approach  has  been  approved  for  evaluation  in  a 
multinational clinical study (see web site for FeRx, Inc.:www.FeRx.com). 
 
Spnps  offer  many  possibilities  for  specific  cellular,  disease  and  organ  targeting 
for imaging and, potentially to achieve higher concentrations of molecules at sites 
of disease than are obtainable following systemic administration.  We believe the 
low  toxicity  of  spnps  in  vivo  in  humans  and  the  ability  to  target  specific  tissues, 
including cancers in vivo, make them their inducible magnetic fields attractive as 
a  new  modality  for  cancer  screening.    The  challenge  is  to  create  a  detector 
sufficiently sensitive to rapidly acquire data on foci of increased magnetic signal 
in spatially defined volumes, which reveal the presence, and location of disease.

Iron  Oxide)8  and  USPIO 

The objective of this study was to determine the physical parameters involved in 
detecting  and  localizing  the  magnetic  field  created  by  superparamagnetic 
particles  localized  on  the  tumor  through  phagocytosis  or  attached  to  tumor 
antigen-specific  monoclonal  antibodies  targeted  to  occult  human  cancers    Over 
the last two decades dextran coated magnetic nanoparticles have found a variety 
of  applications  in  the  biological  and  medical  sciences.  Molday  and  Mackenzie5 
first  describe  the  use  of  dextran-coated  particles  with  a  15  nm  iron  oxide  core 
coupled to antibodies and other ligand for cell separation in the laboratory. More 
recently  a  variety  of  smaller  particles  MIONS  (Monocrystalline  Iron  Oxide 
Nanocolloid)  6,  PION  (Polycrystalline  Iron  Oxide  Nanocolloid)7,  LCDIO  (Long 
Circulating  Dextran-coated 
(Ultra  Small 
Superparamagnetic  Iron  Oxide)9  have  found  application  as  contrast  agents  in 
MRI  studies.  These  particles  have  been  introduced  in  vivo  and  are  found  to  be 
non-toxic.  Maximum  localization  on  a  specifically  targeted  region  (tumors,  liver, 
lungs,  lymph  nodes)  occur  approximately  24  hours  after  injection  and  typically 
the majority of nanoparticles have passed out of the body within a week.  
 
There are approximately 109 cells in one gram of tissue.  If these cells formed a 
sphere,  there  would  be  about  106      cells  comprising    the  surface.    The  recent 
demonstration by Lewin et al2  that , in vitro , biologic transporter molecules such 
as  certain  peptide  sequences  of  HIV-1  attached  to  spnps  can    achieve 
intracellular  concentrations  of  iron  of  10  to 30 pg of iron per cell or 10 to 30 ug 
per  106  cells,  an  amount  for  paramagnetic  iron  which  should  be  detectable  by 
induction  of  a  local  magnetic  signal  arising  from  the  tumor  volume.    Such 
concentrations  have  not  yet  been  achieved  in  vivo  but  as  methods  of  targeting 
cancer  cells  in  vivo  improve,  achieving  such  concentrations  of  spnps  in  early 
stage  cancer  seems  within  the  realm  of  possibility.    Even  current  methods  of 
targeting result in concentrations of spnps in experimental tumors that we believe 
should be detectable by virtue of their magnetic susceptibility.  Thus Moore et al 8    
achieved  concentrations  between  11.9ng  and  118ng  of  iron  per  million  tumor 
cells growing as a mass in a rodent model after systemic injection of LCDIO.  We 
have  modeled  the  ability  of  ultrasensitve  SQUIDS  to  detect  the  magnetic  fields 
that would be generated by these concentrations of iron.  
 
Ultra-sensitive  SQUID 
Interference  Device) 
(Superconducting  Quantum 
amplifiers have been used for imaging the magnetic fields produced by electrical 
activities  in  the  brain  and  heart.  Naturally  occurring  biomagnetic  signals  in  the 
body are very small it was not until the advent of SQUID technology that practical 
measurements  of  these  signals  have  been  attainable.  Since  the  advent  of 
SQUID  technology  much  effort  has  gone  into  imaging  and  mapping  the 
biomagnetic signals produced by electromagnetic signals in the brain and heart. 
SQUID  helmets  with  large  numbers  of  array  elements10  (>100)  have  been 
produced to measure and map brain signals. Magnetocardiography (MCG)11 and 
Magneto-Encephalography  (MEG)10  signals  are  time  varying  and  produce 
changes  in  the  magnetic  flux  outside  the  body.  Since  the  inherent  sensitivity  
(noise  limit)  is  about  2  x  10-14T  / Hz 12,  operational  bandwidths,  we  are 

 

4

considering  (.1-40  Hz),  allow  for  sensitivities  as  low  as  approximately  1.5x10-13 
Tesla.  System  design  and  the  ambient  fields  in  the  vicinity  of  the  probe 
determine  noise  levels.  Using  gradiometer  configuration  pick-up  coils  signal 
levels  on  the  order  of  2  x  10-15T  /cm  are  readily  achievable  with  good  system 
design13  in  an  unscreened  relatively  low  noise  environment.  A  diagram,  which 
summarizes  the  sensitivities  of  some  of  the  more  common  magnetometry 
techniques as a function of frequency, is Figure12.1 in Bioelectromagnetism14.  
 
SQUID  scanner  systems  have  been  developed  for  use  in  Non-Destructive 
Evaluation15  (NDE)  of  materials.  Limitations  in  the  cost  effectiveness  and 
penetration  depths  have  hindered  the  techniques  commercial  introduction  and 
most  SQUID  NDE  evaluation  still  takes  place  in  university  laboratories.  SQUID 
scanners  using  an  ac  field16  have  been  used  to  determine  the  magnetic 
susceptibility  of  human  organs  in  the  body.  While  this  type  of  system  could 
potentially be used for the application we are describing, the ac field introduces a 
range  of  issues  (electronic  stability,  balancing,  eddy  current  noise  etc.)  that  are 
for  the  most  part  avoided  with  our  design.  R.  Ilmoniemi  et  al.12  developed  a 
SQUID scanner with many of the attributes of  the system we are proposing. The 
main  difference  being  that  they  were  looking  for  a  ferromagnetic  inclusion 
(acupuncture  needle)  and  hence  their  system  has  no  inducing  magnetic  field. 
Other  similar  systems,  used  to  measure  iron  stores  in  the  liver  have  been 
described in the literature17 
 
 
We    investigate  the  limits  of  SQUID  detection  and  localization  on  spnps  at 
concentrations and at distances required for use of this technology as a rapid low 
cost method for screening for many types of cancers.  

 

Simulations 
A system for measuring the signature of a localized superparamagnetic particles 
within the body must have the following properties: 

1)  An induction field. 
2)  Method  for  inducing  a  magnetization  induced  flux  change  (ac  field  or 

motion). 

3)  Method for measuring a magnetization flux change. 
4)  Extreme stability  
5)  Extreme sensitivity 

the  physical  parameters 

 
While 
to  be  measured  are  necessarily  design 
dependent,  we  have  chosen  to  simulate  the  system  described  below  as  it 
appears to be a straight forward and solves some of the problems inherent in the 
design of this type of measurement. 
 
The  initial  simulations  were  performed  to  identify  theoretical  limitations  and 
determine  the  physical  parameters  under  which  a  SQUID  coupled  sensing

device  could  obtain  a  signal  from  a  superparamagnetic  inclusion  located  in  the 
body.  To do this we developed a brute force three-dimensional simulation of the 
body, superparamagnetic inclusion, applied magnetic field, and sensing coils. By 
necessity a scanner design must be chosen and a particular protocol simulated. 
We have chosen a scanner, which incorporates a DC superconducting induction 
field  (low  noise  and  highly  stable)  and  uses  motion  of  the  patient  to  produce  a 
flux change in the pick up coils. This design is simple, cost effective and flexible.  
 
The  magnetic  field  was  modeled  as  a  racetrack  geometry  extending  across  the 
width of the body (Figure 1). Neglecting end effects (extending the magnet well 
past  the  width  of  the  body),  the  magnetic  field  could  then  be  modeled  as  a 
contribution  from  two  wires  separated  by  14cm,  each  wire  located  7cm  on 
opposite sides of the scan point. To minimize ambient noise and the background 
signal,  the  pickup  coils  were  modeled  in  a  planar  first-order  gradiometer 
configuration18  with  each  of  the  counter  wound  pickup  coils  having  an  area  of 
1cm2  and  each  coil  located  along  the  length-axis  with  the  center  of  the  coils 
displaced  2.5  cm  on  either  side  of  the  scan  point,  Figure  1.  The  magnetic  field 
signal due to the inclusion and/or a background cube is calculated at a point at 
the center of each coil.  
 
The  phantom  torso  (body)  in  our  simulations  was  modeled  as  an  ellipsoid  filled 
with  water.  This  approximation  was  used  to  determine  the  maximum  absolute 
contribution  of  a  large  slowly  varying  diamagnetic  background  (of  approximate 
torso dimensions) with rapidly varying edges. There are clearly limitations on the 
information that can be obtained from this simple model but the model is useful 
for determining some of the limitations of the technique. 
 
A  three  dimensional  rectangle  was  formed  with  dimensions  of  length  120cm, 
width 20cm and thickness 20cm, Figure 2. The dimensions of the rectangle were 
then  divided  into  mm3  cubes  and  the  magnetization  from  each  cube  contributes 
to  the  measured  signal.  The  torso  was  modeled  in  the  rectangular  box  as  an 
elongated ellipsoid with the same maximum dimensions as the rectangle. During 
the  summing  of  the  magnetic  field  contributions  of  the  magnetization,  cubes 
located outside the ellipsoid produced no contribution to the field at the sensing 
coils.  Cubes  located  inside  the  ellipsoid  had  a  diamagnetic  response  to  the 
applied field and produce a corresponding contribution to the field at the SQUID 
sensing  coil.  The  Molar  Diamagnetic  susceptibility  of  water  is  –13x10-6 
(emu/mole). The tumor was modeled as a paramagnetic inclusion and could be 
located at various positions within the ellipsoid. The tumor with magnetic particles 
was represented as the contribution from 1mm square cube located within a 1cm 
diameter  sphere.  These  “tumor”  cubes  had  both  a  diamagnetic  contribution 
(body)  and  a  paramagnetic  contribution  due  to  the  magnetic  nanoparticles. 
Experimentally  determined  values  for  the  paramagnetic  contributions  will  be 
described in the next section.

The magnetic field located at a distance r from a solenoid wire has a magnitude 
equal to B(r)=C/r where C is a constant determined by the magnetic field at 1 cm. 
This field was taken to be 3500 G, producing a total magnetic field of 1kG at the 
central  scan  point.  The  field  is  a  vector  quantity  radiating  tangentially  from  a 
circle or radius r centered on the wire. The field due to the second wire circulates 
in  the  opposite  direction  giving  a  significant  cancellation  of  the  x  components 
near  the  vertical  line  passing  through  the  scan  point.  The  y-components  of  the 
magnetic fields located near the same vertical line add, producing strong vertical 
polarization  of  the  diamagnetic  ellipsoid  and  the  magnetically  enhanced  tumor. 
By knowing the direction of the magnetic field and magnetic susceptibility at any 
point  in  the  matrix  we  can  calculate  the  magnetization  vector.  Treating  the 
magnetization  of  a  mm3  cube  as  a  magnetic  dipole  we  can  calculate  the 
magnetic field produced by the sample magnetization at the position of the pick 
up coils.  
 
The scan covers the upper positive quadrant of the three dimensional rectangle 
and hence the upper quadrant of the ellipsoid. The rectangle and ellipsoid were 
shifted by 10cm from the X-Y plane to allow for a scan across the full width of the 
body.  In general the pickup coils were placed 1 cm from the top of the ellipsoid. 
A  scan  at  any  one  scan  point  includes  a  scan  volume  of  140  mm  along  the 
length, 200mm along the width and 100 mm of thickness and the magnetic field 
is  calculated  at  each  of  the  two  counterwound  pickup  coils  for  each  of  the  ten 
scan  elements.  The  140  mm  finite  length  of  the  scan  volume  has  the  effect  of 
clipping the generated signal at distances greater then or equal to 7 cm from the 
tumor along the length axis. As the scanner is moved the length of the body 600 
of these scan volumes are included in the total scan. We estimate that the total 
11  SQUID  simulation  includes  approximately  1x1011  calculations  and  takes 
approximately  9.5  hours  on  a  960MHz  Pentium  III  PC.  Even  so  the  mm3  grain 
size  appears  as  rapid  jumps  in  the  torso  contribution  as  the  mm3  grains  are 
limited  by  the  smooth  ellipsoidal  function  and  in  the  tumor  contribution  as  the 
mm3 grains are limited by a smooth spherical function. 
 

Experimental Determination of Simulation Parameters 

Magnetic Nanoparticles 
Two types of targeted nanoparticle contributions to the paramagnetic moment of 
the  tumors  were  considered.    The  first  targeted  nanoparticle  we  will  consider  is 
used  in  MRI  contrast  imaging.  The  paramagnetic  contribution  was  calculated 
using the parameters given in Shen et al.6, who studied the behavior of magnetic 
nanoparticles uptake by mouse brain tumors as a contrast agent for MRI. Tumor 
cell  uptake  of  LCDIO,  in  a  rodent  model,  was  found  to  be  between  11.9ng  and 
118ng  of  iron  per  million  cells8.    In  this  study  the  LCDIO  data  is  being  used  to 
determine  that  the  minimum  signal  and  we  therefore  use  a  value  of  (12.5ng  of 
iron)/(1  million  tumor  cells),  at  the  bottom  range  of  their  reported  results.  Using 
the  reasonable  assumption  that  there  are  approximately  1x106  cells/mm3,  we 

 

7

estimate  that  a  1  cm3  tumor  to  contain  12.5µg  of  Fe.  From  the  graph  of  the 
magnetization  vs.  field  in  Shen  et  al.  we  observed  that  the  saturation 
magnetization  occur  for  magnetic  fields  >  5  kG.    In  the  field  range  we  will  be 
working, < 2 kG, the magnetization vs. field is approximately a straight line and 
from this observation we took the magnetic susceptibility for fields less then 2kG 
to  be  2.2x10-2  emu/gm  (Fe).    Simulation  results  using  these  parameters  are 
labeled LCDIO.   

The  second  set  of  parameters  which  we  used  to  simulate  maximal  targeting  of 
the cancer tumor were obtained from in vitro targeting to specific lines of cancer 
cells  with  monoclonal  antibody  attached  magnetic  nanoparticles.    These 
conjugates are produced commercially by Miltenyi  Inc. for use in cell separation. 
Due to the high number of potential binding sites on the cancer cells, we chose to 
use  Miltenyi’s  anti-cytokeratin  monoclonal  antibodies  that  were  conjugated  to 
magnetic  nanoparticles.    Simulation  results  using  these  parameters  are  labeled 
MACS. 
 
LNCaP human prostate cancer cells and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were 
grown  at  37°  C  and  100%  humidity  in  Dulbecco’s  modified  Eagle’s  medium 
containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Both cell lines were routinely subpassaged to 
maintain them in log-growth phase. To label the LNCaP and MCF-7 cells with the 
magnetic  anti-cytokeratin  antibodies, 
the  cells  were  harvested  by  quick 
trypsinization,  and  pelleted  in  a  clinical  centrifuge.  Following  a  short  wash  with 
phosphate buffered saline solution, the cells were again pelleted and allowed to 
dry  briefly.  The  antibodies  were  then  bound  to  the  LNCaP  and  MCF-7  cancer 
cells  as  per  the  manufacturer’s  protocol.  Following  antibody  binding,  the  cells 
were  counted  with  a  hemocytometer  and  aliquoted  into  microfuge  tubes  for 
SQUID analysis. 
 
To determine the physical parameters associated with using the MACS particles 
in the simulation we performed a series of experiments using a Quantum Design 
SQUID  magnetometer. 
their  particles  as 
polysaccharide coated iron oxide nanoparticles approximately 50 nm in diameter.  
To  obtain  an  estimation  of  the  mean  size  of  the  iron  oxide  component  of  the 
nanoparticles  we  have  measured  the  field  cooled  and  zero  field  cooled 
magnetization  as  a  function  of  temperature  (Figure  3a).    The  blocking 
temperature  of  iron  oxide  nanoparticles  is  well-known  as  a  function  of 
temperature  and  from  the  observed  blocking  temperature  we  estimate  that  the 
iron  oxide  particles  in  the  Miltenyi  microbeads  have  a  mean  in  diameter  of 
approximately 6-10 nm. We do not expect that the distribution contains significant 
number of particles greater then 10 nm since this would produce of remanence at 
temperatures  greater  than  the  measured  blocking  temperature.  To  determine  if 
the  nanoparticles  are  truly  superparamagnetic  or  if  they  have  some  remnant 
moment we measured in the in-phase and out-of-phase magnetic susceptibility of 
the particles, between 1 Hz and 1000 Hz, at 310 K (Figure 3b). it can easily be 
seen  that  these  particles  are  paramagnetic.    There  is  a  large  approximately

the  magnetic  susceptibility  and  the  out-of-phase 
constant  component  of 
component is very small over the whole frequency range in but does increase as 
a function of frequency.   
 
To determine the magnetization values to be used in the simulation we measured 
the magnetization as a function of magnetic field for the particles targeted to the 
LNCaP and MCF-7 cancer cells at 310 K (Figure 4).  One significant difference 
between the MACS particles and the LCDIO particles is that the MACS particles 
require a much lower magnetic field to obtain saturation magnetization. The data 
was fit to a Langevin function for a collection paramagnetic particles.  From these 
fits  the  magnetization/particle  was  determined  and  found  to  be  consistent  with 
what  would  be  expected  for  8-10  nm  sized  Fe3O4  nanoparticle.    The  breast 
cancer  cells  were  each  determined  to  have  picked  up  approximately  3.3  x  105 
MACS particles.  The prostate cancer cells had binding values approximately one 
of order of magnitude less then that obtained for the breast cancer cells.  We fit a 
9th  order  polynomial  function  to  the  magnetization  (M)  vs.  magnetic  field  (H) 
curve and used the function M(H) in the simulations.  At each cube of tumor cell, 
in the simulation, we first determine the value and direction of the magnetic field.  
Then  using  the  M(H)  function  we  determine  the  magnetization  vector  for  that 
cube.  
  
Based on the concentration of  LCDIO nanoparticles achievable in tumor cells in 
vivo  in  a  rodent  model,  we  determined  what  we  consider  to  be  the  minimum 
values  required  for  detection  of  a  useful  signal  in  a  screening  system.    The 
MACS  data  provide  the  maximum  possible  targeting  of  a  specific  monoclonal 
antibody  to  two  types  of  cancer  cell  lines.  The  MACS  data  provide  a  more 
idealized  situation  but  one  which  points  to  the  possibilities  inherent  in  this 
technique. 
 
 
Results 
We  first  determined  the  feasibility  of  detecting    the  magnetic  field  generated  by 
the maximum number of MACS expected to be localized in tumor with a volume 
of one cubic centimeter.  To address this question, we need to consider the limits 
of SQUID technology and the effects of ambient noise. Our initial approach is to 
model detection of different strengths of generated signal assuming zero external 
noise and then to address the realities of background signal. 
 
The  absolute  magnetic  field  generated  by  a  1  cm3  tumor  at  various  distances 
from  the  SQUID  scanner  is  shown  is  Figure  5.    In  this  range,  the  signals  are 
above  detection  limits.  For  example,  magnetocardiogram  signals  have  been 
detected with SQUID scanners in the sub pico-Tesla range. The signal from the 
LCDIO particles at a depth of 11 cm is  in the pico-Tesla range.  The signal from 
the MACS particles attached to the human breast cancer, at this depth,  is  four 
orders of magnitude greater than those from the LCDIO particles.

Far  field  noise  reductions  of  two  to  four  orders  of  magnitude  can  be  achieved 
with  a  well-balanced  gradiometer  configuration  for  the  pick-up  coils.  Currently 
lithographic techniques used to pattern planar pickup coils can provide excellent 
balance.  While 
field  detected  by  gradiometer 
configurations is smaller then the absolute magnetic field, this difference is more 
then compensated for by the reduction (cancellation) in ambient noise. Figure 6 
is the scan, for an 11 SQUID scanner, neglecting the signal from the body. The 
spatial  distribution  of  the  differential  scan  signal  at  the  various  pickup  coils, 
generated from a signal a depth of 5cm from the central pickup coil, is plotted. As 
the scanner moves across the length of the scan rectangle, the pickup coil on the 
near  side  begins  to  pickup  the  signal.  The  signal  reaches  a  maximum  close  to 
the point where the pickup coil is positioned vertically over the tumor. The signal 
then  goes  to  zero  when  the  scan  point  is  directly  over  the  tumor  and  becomes  
negative as the other counterwound coil passes over the tumor.  
 
We believe that the pickup coils must  to be able to sense at a minimum of 10 cm 
into the body. For a maximum body thickness of 20 cm (for a patient lying on a 
flat  table),  the  anterior  and  posterior  surfaces  would  be  scanned  to  include  the 
entire  anatomy.  Allowing  for  1cm  clearance  between  the  pickup  coils  and  the 
body  surface,  the  minimum  scanning  distance  is  11  cm.  The  raw  signal  for  a 
tumor located 11 cm from the pickup coils is shown if Figure 7 and the  maximum 
differential signals (signal from the pickup coil) from the tumor as a function of the 
vertical distance of the tumor from the scan point of the detector (for both LCDIO 
and MACS targeted MCF-7 human breast cancer cells) are shown in Figure 8. 
 
The magnitude of the signal for the LCDIO particles exceeds the resolution of the 
technique  in  an  unscreened  environment.  However,  the  signal  to  noise  ratio  is 
probably not adequate for realistic and reproducible detection with  an expected 
ambient  noise  of  about    10-12  Tesla.  The  LCDIO  particles  represent  a  minimum 
signal that has  been achieved in vivo. The targeted MACS produce a signal four 
orders of magnitude greater then that produced by LCDIO particles and are well 
within the detection limits of a SQUID scanner.  The MACS particles represent a 
maximum  signal  for  cell  targeting  and  as  such  provide  an  upper  bound  for 
targeting  a  1  cm3  tumor  with  this  particular  size  and  type  of  magnetic 
nanoparticle. 
 
We  simulated  the  effects  of  the  diamagnetic  background  of  the  body.  A  tumor 
located in an ellipsoid of the susceptibility of water and positioned 11 cm from the 
SQUID sensor is illustrated in Figure 9.  The LCDIO value  at 6 cm results in a 
signal  approximately  equal 
the  diamagnetic 
background  and  can  therefore  be  resolved.  It  should  be  noted  that  the 
background  has  a  noise  associated  with  it,  which  appears  as  ripples.  These 
“ripples” are an artifact of the algorithm, as previously described, but provide an 
artificially  implemented  noise  level  at  approximately  0.1  nano-Tesla.  While 
signals in this sub pico-Tesla regime have been measured in scanners, it is likely 
that  the  addition  of  the  superconducting  solenoid  with  a  DC  magnetic  field  of 

the  maximum  signal  of 

to 

 

10

approximately  0.1  Tesla  will  significantly  increase  the  noise  level.    Unlike  a 
Helholtz coil where the vast majority of noise is induced through the electronics, 
a  superconducting  solenoid  in  its  persistent  mode  is  very  stable  and  introduces 
very  little  noise.  We  expect  the  main  source  of  noise  to  be  from  vibrations  of 
surrounding materials in this magnetic field.  We believe a scanner, operating in 
the described magnetic fields, can be constructed with an intrinsic noise level  of 
~0  .1  nano-Tesla.  We  selected  this  level  of  noise  to  begin  to  set  limits  on  this 
technique. This artificial noise is more then an order of magnitude larger then the 
signal of an LCDIO tumor at 11 cm making detection impossible.  To resolve a 1 
cm3  tumor  at  11  cm,  at  this  noise  level,  requires  approximately  two  orders  of 
magnitude  more  signal  strength.  Such  signals  are  likely  to  be  achievable  as  in 
vivo targeting of spnps evolve. 
 
To  consider  background  signal,  we  investigated  the  effects  of  a  uniform 
background signal upon detection of a tumor located in a large organ.  Moore et 
al.8  considered  this  issue  with  regard  to  9L gliosarcoma brain tumors labeled in 
vivo  in  a  rodent  model..  In  this  study,  uptake  by  the  brain  tumor  was 
approximately  0.11%  of  injected  dose  and    the  surrounding  normal  brain  tissue 
had about on tenth of the tumor concentration of LCDIO. The effect of this type of 
background signal was investigated in Figure 11. We modeled a   1.0 cm3  tumor 
located  in  an  organ  at  5  cm  from  the  scanner.  The  organ  was  modeled  as  a 
rectangular box with thickness 2.5 cm on either side of the tumor, width 5cm on 
either  side  of  the  tumor  and  length  5  cm  on  either  side  of  the  tumor  in  the 
direction of the scan length.  The organ was given an Iron Oxide concentration of 
1%  of  the  tumor  concentration.  The  diamagnetic  background  of  the  body  was 
included. The scan in Figure 11 shows that a 1% organ background produces a 
signal  comparable  to  the  signal  due  to  the  tumor.  At  1%  the  signal  due  to  the 
tumor  is  still  resolvable.  Simulations  were  also  done  with  a  10%  background 
tumor. In these simulations the background signal is orders of magnitude greater 
then  the  tumor  signal.  Subtraction  of  this  background  signal  is  problematic  and 
sets  limits  on  contributions  due  to  surrounding  tissue.  On  the  other  hand  for 
intravenously  administered 
Iron  Oxide  particles  conjugated  with 
monoclonal  antibodies  it  was  found  that  tissue  surrounding  the  tumor  had 
“modest” uptake but no evidence of the presence of monoclonal antibodies. This 
suggests that well constructed magnetic label-target specific vector conjugate will 
provide 
tumor  uptake  while  minimizing 
background.  
 
The  body scans in the plane of the scanner, the XY plane, show that localization 
of the signal is a function of the number of pickup coils comprising the scanner. 
There are several attributes of the signal that may be used to determine depth in 
the  body.    One  well-known  attribute  is  that  the  peak  of  the  differential  signal 
changes  in  position  as  a  function  of  depth  (Figure  1a).  Another    perhaps  more 
useful  way  of  determining  depth  is  suggested  by  the  form  of  the  magnetization 
vs. the magnetic field curve in Figure 4.  The deeper the tumor in the body, i.e. 
from  the  greater  the  distance  to  the  scanner,  the  smaller  the  magnetic  field.

When  the tumor signal is in the XY plane, a series of shorter length scans can 
be  performed  with  increasing  magnetic  field.    This  type  of  field  scan,  using  the 
signal  obtained  from  MACS  attached  to  MCF-7A  cells,    is  illustrated    in  Figure 
11b.  The  data  as  a  function  of  magnetic  field  can  be  fit  reasonably  well  by  a 
power law and the exponent of the power law changes significantly as a function 
of tumor depth..  Therefore, it is possible to expand the signal as a function of the 
power law's and determine the signal has a function of depth.  
 
 
Discussion 
 
In  a  practical  embodiment  of  the  proposed  scanner,  the  magnetic  field  solenoid 
and  scan  elements  would  be  located  beneath  the  patient  facing  upward.    The 
patient  would  be  moved  over  the  scanner  on  a  flat  conveyor  system  without 
contact with scanner.  Thus,  the scanner is  isolated from vibrations associated 
with  patient  movement.  The  magnetic  field  solenoid  and  pickup  coil  loops  must 
be  rigidly  connected  to  each  other.    In  magnetic  fields  of  a  few  kG,  vibration  or 
motion  of  the  pickup  coils  will  produce  noise  levels  greater  than  the  sample 
signals.  
 
The SQUID sensor is located approximately 30 cm from the pickup coils in a Nb 
enclosure.  The magnetic field should not  affect the SQUID.  Before  a scan, the 
SQUIDs  can  be  reset  to  lock  the  trapped  flux  due  to  the  superconducting 
solenoid in the pickup coil loops. Variations of magnetic field are measured with 
respect  to  this  constant  amount  of  trap  magnetic  flux.  At  reasonable  transport 
rates of 5 to 10 cm per second so that  a body scan would be completed in 20 to 
40 seconds.  This rapid scan rate allows multiple scans to be averaged, reducing  
the  signal  to  noise  ratio.  SQUID  drift  would  be  measured    measured  before    a 
scan and compensated for over the duration  of the scan. 
 
While SQUID magnetometers have intrinsically high sensitivity, their behavior is 
usually  limited  by  the  ambient  noise  of  the  environment.    In  the  measurement 
mode  considering,    the  SQUID  effectively  integrates  its  signal  over  a  large 
frequency  range.    Although,  noise  can  occur  over  a  large  range  of  frequencies.  
High  pass  filtering  (>  1  Hz),  by  shorting  the  SQUID  terminals  with  copper  wire, 
can  reduce the inherent low-frequency noise..  A low pass filter less then 104 Hz 
will  reduce noise from radio waves.  However, geomagnetic noise, general low-
frequency  noise  due  to  motion  of  cars,  trucks,  air-conditioning,  human  activity, 
etc.,  and  line  frequency  noise  associated  higher  harmonics,  may  require  
enclosing  the scanner and transport mechanism in a room with electromagnetic 
and  mu  metal  shielding.    Specific  filtering  of  the  SQUID  signal  at  the  line 
frequency and higher harmonics may also be needed.. 
 
In  terms  of  the  physical  parameters  analyzed  in  this  simple  model,  values  of 
magnetization  in  realistic  magnetic  induction  fields  are  measurable  with  SQUID 
technology.  There  are  several  variables  that  can  be  potentially  modified  to 

 

12

enhance  the  signals  generated  using  this  technique.  It  is  clear  that  the  4  nm 
LCDIO  particles,  and  uptake  rates  reported  from  MRI  studies,  provide  enough 
signal for a 1 cm3 tumor to be detected at 10 cm depth in the body.  Even so the 
signal to noise ratio will be poor.  Uptake of the LCDIO particles occurs through 
phagocytosis  and  as  such  they  are  not  specifically  targeted  to  the  tumor  cells.  
The LCDIO samples are also not specifically designed to maximize the signal in 
a SQUID scanner.  Data from the MACS targeted samples offers an example of 
what maybe possible.  The MACS data is four orders of magnitude greater then 
the  LCDIO  data  and  would  provide  sufficient  signal  to  noise  ratio  for  a  1  cm3 
tumor to be observed at distances greater then 12 cm from the scanner.  In the 
body  one  would  not  expect  this  type  of  the  maximal  targeting  that  we  have 
presented  from  in  vitro  combination  of  cells  and  targeted  nanoparticles.    One 
might expect targeting ratios of the few percent of possible antigen sites thereby 
dropping the signal by one to two orders of magnitude. One possible direction for 
enhancing  signal  is  therefore  to  maximize  nanoparticle  to  tumor  binding.  The 
main  parameters  available  for  enhancement  of  the  signal  are  related  to  the 
characteristics of the nanoparticles.  Nanoparticles moments, above the blocking 
temperature, increase as a function of the radius of the nanoparticles19. It could 
be argued that this increase goes approximately as the radius cubed.  Increasing 
the size of the iron oxide nanoparticles from a radius of 5 nm to radius of 25 nm 
(the maximum size for single crystal iron oxide nanoparticles) would give a signal 
increase of approximately two orders of magnitude.  This increase in size would 
also significantly raise the blocking temperature and increase resonance.  There 
is  a  large  amount  of  work  being  done  to  develop  nanoparticles  for  a  variety  of 
applications.  For  this  application  ideal  nanoparticles  would  have  the  following 
properties: 

1)  A blocking temperature less then 310K,  
2)  Maximized magnetic moment (as a function of size and constituents)   
3)  Non-toxic 
4)  Small enough to pass though the endothelio-reticular system. 
5)  Coated to evade the bodies defenses 

 
 
We  also  analyzed  a  1cm3  tumor  at  5cm  within  a  simulated  organ  of  thickness, 
width  and 
length,  5cmx10cmx10cm  consisting  of  a  diamagnetic  water 
concentration and a 1% of tumor concentration superparamagnetic contribution. 
The organ contribution was as large as the tumor signal suggesting the need for 
efficient targeting. One other way to reduce contributions from an organ would be 
to  measure  and  then  model  the  organ  uptake  and  subtract  the  signal  from  the 
scan.    Theoretically  any  tumor  with  signal  greater  than  the  minimum  noise 
constraints could be identified. 
 
In  conclusion,  magnetic  field  signals  from  a  1  cm3  tumor  loaded  with  in  vivo 
determined  values  (LCDIO)  of  iron  oxide  nanoparticles  produces  significant 
enough  signal  to  be  measured  with  a  DC  SQUID  scanner  at  depth  of  11  cm.  
However when the expected level of noise for this particular type of scanner, is 

 

13

taken into account, the signal is not resolvable. It must be pointed out, that these 
contrast  agents  were  not  designed  for  this  type  of  magnetization  measurement 
and  hence  it  is  likely  that  the  signal  could  be  greatly  improved.    Nanoparticles 
targeted to cells in vitro (MACS) produce signals four orders of magnitude larger 
than those produced by LCDIO particles. At these signal levels tumors, at depths 
greater  than  11  cm,  can  be  detected  by  a  SQUID  scanner  with  signal  to  noise 
ratios  greater  then  100:  1.    We  believe  that  highly  efficient  tumor  targeting  and 
maximization  of  nanoparticle  magnetic  moment  will  be  achieved  in  the  near 
future making SQUID magnetometry an important modality for cancer screening.

Scanner is composed of  ten planar first order gradiometrer pickup coils located 
to the interior of and on the same platform as a superconducting solenoid. The 
value of the magnetic field is the field generated at the midpoint of a set of coils 
of a pickup coil. This is also defined as the scan point. End effects of the solenoid 
are neglected.

The scan covers the upper positive quadrant of the three dimensional rectangle 
and hence the upper quadrant of the ellipsoid. The rectangle and ellipsoid were 
shifted  by  10cm  from  the  X-Y  plane  for  mathematical  simplicity  (all  positions  in 
this quadrant are positive definite).  The pickup coils, located in the scanner are 
located 1 cm above the top of the rectangle.  The magnetic field is in a racetrack 
configuration centered around the scanner platform.

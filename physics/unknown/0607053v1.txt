Abstract 

 
In this paper we investigate the  diffusion of the thermal pulse  eiωt in Planck Gas. 

We show that the Fourier diffusion equation gives the speed of diffusion, v > c and 

breaks  the  causality  of  the  thermal  processes  in  Planck  gas  .For  hyperbolic  heat 

transport v<c and causality is valid

1  INTRODUCTION 

 

In  this  paper  we  develop  a  description  of  heat  transport  in  Planck  gas    We 

consider  the  Planck  gas  of  the  Planck  particles  i.e.    particles  with  the  masses 
equal  to Planck mass~10-5 g     Within the context of special relativity theory we 

investigate the Fourier and hyperbolic diffusion equations. We calculate the speed 

of  thermal  diffusion  in  the  Fourier  approximation  and  show  that  the  thermal 

diffusion  velocity exceeds the speed of light. We show that this result breaks the 

causality  The  same  phenomena  we  describe  within  the  framework  of  the 

hyperbolic  thermal  diffusion  equation  and  show  that  in  that  case  the  speed  of 

diffusion is always less than the speed of light. 

 

2  MINKOWSKI  SPACE-TIME 

We  may  use  the  concept  that  the  speed  of  light  in  vacuo  is  the  upper  limit  of 

speed  and  also  in  which  a  signal  can  travel  between  two  events  to  establish 

whether or not any two events could be connected. In the interest of simplicity we 

shall work with one space dimension x1 = x and the time dimension xo = ct of the 

Minkowski space-time. Let us consider events (1) and (2): their Minkowski interval 

Δs satisfies the relationship:

Δ−Δ=Δ

(1) 

Without  loss of generality we can take Event 1 to be at x = 0, t = 0. Then Event 2 

can be only related to Event 1 if it is possible for a signal  travelling  at the speed 

of  light,  to  connect  them.  If  Event  2  is  at  (Δx,  cΔt),  its  relationship  to  Event  1 

depends on whether Δs > 0, = 0, or < 0. 

We may summarise  the three possibilities as follows: 

Case A  

 time-like  interval, 

Δ

x A

tc
Δ<

,  or 

2 >Δs

0

.  Event  2  can  be  related  to 

Event 1, 

 Events 1 and 2 can be in causal relation. 

 

 

 

 

 

      Case B 

light-like interval, 

Δ

tc
Δ=

, or 

2 =Δs

. Event 2 can only be related to  

Event 1 by  a light signal. 

      Case C  space-like interval 

Δ

x A

tc

, or 

2 <Δs

0

. Event 2 cannot be related to  

Event 1, for  in that case v > c. 

Now let us consider case C in more detail. At first sight, it seems that in case C we 
can  find  out  the  reference  frame  in  which  two  Events  c>  and  c<  always  fulfils  the 

relationship

4   HYPERBOLIC DIFFUSION AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY 

In  monograph  [2]  the  hyperbolic  model  of  the  thermal  transport  phenomena  was 

formulated.  It  was  shown  that  the  description  of  the  ultra-short  thermal  energy 

transport needs the hyperbolic diffusion equation (one dimensional transport)

constant  and  c  is  the  speed  of  light  in  vacuum,  T(x,t)  is  the  temperature  field  and

theory and the causality is not broken

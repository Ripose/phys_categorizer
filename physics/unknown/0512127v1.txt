Abstract 

   A new method, based on the original theory of conservation of sum of kinetic and potential 
energy defined for prices is proposed and applied on Dow Jones Industrials Average (DJIA). 
The general trends averaged over months or years gave a roughly conserved total energy, with 
three  different  potential  energies,  i.e.  positive  definite  quadratic,  negative  definite  quadratic 
and  linear  potential  energy  for  exponential  rises  (and  falls),  sinusoidal  oscillations  and 
parabolic  trajectories,  respectively.  Corresponding  expressions  for  force  (impact)  are  also 
given.

1. Introduction 
 
A wide diversity of literature emphasizes randomness in short-range behavior of market. Yet, 
short-  and  long-range  behaviors  may  differ  in  many  characteristic  aspects.  We  claim  in  the 
present work that, there may exist some fundamental and deep lying structures, which are not 
displayed  in  short-range  fluctuations.  Similar  to  the  difference  in  several  properties  of  shell 
and core electrons in atom, and the difference between surface and bulk properties of crystal, 
and so forth, the pronounced deeper structures in time series may be quite different than those 
of short-range states. We propose that, some quantities as a function of value (price) χ(t) of 
the index (share) and its nth-time derivatives with arbitrary n, may be conserved during market 
journeys (composed of fluctuations, oscillations, rises and falls, crashes, etc). We will focus in 
the present work on these functions with only two arguments, namely χ, and v (=dχ/dt), i.e. 
speed. We will search the forms, where the variables are separated, and furthermore the speed 
part  is  ½v2.  These  functions  may  be  visualized  simply  as  algebraic  mappings  of  χ-v  space 
onto  real  number  space.  The  quantity  of  ½v2  and  χ-part  may  be  called  arbitrarily.  Or,  by 
assuming unit mass for value (price), one may define and consider ½v2 term as the “kinetic 
energy”,  and  the  rest  as  the  “potential  energy”,  and  the  total  as  (we  prefer  to  call)  “total 
energy”,  respectively.  In  the  existing  perspective,  χ,  v,  a=d2χ/dt2,  etc.  may  be  deduced  in 
terms of analytical functions of these conserved quantities. And finally, the whole formalism 
may  lead  to  describe  the  time  series,  epoch  by  epoch,  where  the  corresponding  potential 
energy expression remains constant in form and in parameters. Yet, there may be some other 
conserved quantities which have more complicated, i.e., non-linear, terms in χ and dχ/dt. 

   In  summary,  our  message  is  fourfold:  Any  time  series  may  involve  conserved  quantities. 
Some of these quantities may be named (and considered) as energy, which may be utilized to 
obtain  analytical  expressions  for  price  (χ),  time  rate  of  change  of  price,  i.e.  speed  (v),  and 
acceleration  (a=d2χ/dt2),  etc.,  as  a  function  of  time.  Thirdly,  long-range  behaviors  may  be 
described  epoch  by  epoch,  each  characterized  by  different  potential  energies  involving 
different  forms  and  parameters.  And,  the  last,  all  these  long-range  properties  may  be  quite 
different than those obtainable via short-range fluctuations. 
  
 
 
Kinetic,  potential, and total energy 
 
One may define kinetic energy for prices χ(t) (taking mass equal to unity) as 
 

K = ½v2    , 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

 

 

 

 

(2) 

U + K + EO = ET   , 

U = h0 + h1(χ – χav) + h2(χ – χav)2 + Γ(3)    ,  

 
where  v  is  the  usual  speed  i.e.,  v(t)=dχ(t)/dt.  Furthermore,  a  potential  energy  U  in  terms  of 
difference in prices (χ(t) – χav) may be defined for any time series. In general,  U is assumed 
to involve terms, which may be written as a sum like 
 
 
 
where χav is some time average of prices, which defines the zero-potential-level if h0=0, and 
Γ(3) stands for the sum of third- and higher-order terms. The coefficients hn are proportional 
to  price  derivatives  dnU/dχn  evaluated  at  (χ=χav)  for  n=0,  1,  2,  and  h1=h2=0,  |h0/Γ(3)|<<1 
expresses a constant potential energy. Without any loss of generality, χav and h0 in Eq. (2) is 
set to zero for any epoch. 
   We may write the total energy ET as 
 
 
 
where EO represents any other form of energy (like Gibb’s energy, entropy) may be present in 
the  market,  else  then  U  and  K.  In  this  work  we  will  confine  ourselves  to  study  only  these 
epochs, for which EO≅0, Γ'(3)≅0 (EO/ET<<1, |Γ(3)/h1χ|<<1, and |Γ(3)/h2χ2| <<1) and assume 
conservation of the sum of potential and kinetic energies, as long as friction forces, damping 
etc. are negligible. The dimensional unit of energy terms (K, U, and E) may be taken as (local 
currency unit/time)2 for shares, e.g.,  (¢/day)2 or ($/day)2 in USA. For indices local currency 
unit  (lcu)  may  be  kept  in  the  units  or  it  may  be  substituted  by  “value”.  In  potential  energy 
expression,  h1  and  h2  terms  will  have  the  unit  (lcu/time2),  and  the  unit  of  (time–2),  i.e., 
frequency squared, respectively. 
 
 
 
Energy conservation and equations of motion 
 
Assuming conservation of total energy, time differentiation of Eq. (3) yields 
 

(3) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

h1 + 2h2χ + dv/dt = 0   , 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(4) 

 
where the common term v is dropped. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(6) 

(7) 

χ(t) = χ0 + v0t + ½ h1 t2    , 

   One has, for |h2/h1|<<1 and h2<0 in Eq. (4) the familiar equation of motion for rises and falls 
in constant acceleration field, e.g. gravitation  as in classical particle mechanics 
 
 
 
where  χ0,  and  v0  designate  initial  price  and  speed,  respectively.  Time  runs  over  exchange 
process days (t) and may be set to zero for the beginning of any epoch. For |h1/h2|<<1, and 0< 
h2 Eq. (4) yields oscillations; 
 

(5) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

χ(t) = χ0 + vavt + Asin(wt + Φ)   , 

 

 
where  A,  w,  and  Φ  is  the  usual  amplitude,  angular  frequency  (here,  (2h2)½),  and  phase, 
respectively.  Such  oscillations  are  observed  in  general  to  have  some  medium  range  time 
periods, and fade away after a few (two, or three) full periods, where the sign and magnitude 
of vav indicates the up, down or horizontal character of oscillatory trends. For |h1/h2|<<1, and 
h2 <0 in Eq. (4), we have exponential growths, 
 

χ(t) = χ0 exp(βt) +  χ’0 exp(-βt)   , 

 

 
with β2=-2h2, and after a short transition interval the decaying part can be neglected. 
   It may be underlined that, U=0 corresponds to a zero impact stituation in market under the 
assumption of conservation of total energy, i.e., supply (offer) and demand meet and price is 
stable, since F=a= –∂U/∂χ. The case h2=0, and |Γ(3)/h1χ|<<1 describes a linear potential, (as 
gravity on the earth surface), where h1 becomes the gravitational (anti-gravitational) constant 
with 0<h1 (0>h1). For h1=0, and |Γ(3)/h2χ2|<<1 we have a quadratic potential energy, which 
may result in an exponential growth or oscillations for a spring-mass potential energy with a 
spring constant (Hooke constant) equal to 2h2. 
   The parameters of Eq. (2) i.e., hn, may differ from one epoch to the other for any share and 
also from one share to another in any epoch. Whenever two nonnegligible terms exist in Eqs. 
(2) and (3), these cases can be treated by perturbational methods. Furthermore, we may give 
an accurate definition for epoch in energy language as, an epoch in a time series is the period 
of time when the (form of and the parameters involved in) potential energy remains the same. 
So,  as  long  as  the  present  form  of  U  does  not  change,  the  present  epoch  survives,  and  vice 
versa. Furthermore, some additive potential energy terms may exist in the full expression, in 
order  to  involve  the  relatively  small  deviations  (decorations)  in  price.  Such  cases,  may  be 
indicated as time terms within epochs. 
   It is worth to note that a similar (but not the same) approach has been followed by Ide and 
Sornette[1, 2], where the time derivative of speed was written in terms of a linear combination 
of χn and vm, with arbitrary powers (See Eqs. (11)-(13), (32), (33), in [1], and Eqs. (1)-(3) in 
[2].)  There, no assumption about the conservation of the sum of kinetic and potential energies 
was made. They have obtained oscillations and up (down) trends by neglecting the speed and 
restoring terms, respectively. 
   In the next section, DJIA is investigated in terms of epochs with different potential energies, 
where we ignore the day-to-day variations and claim only that  long-term and medium-term 
trends of the DJIA conserve energy. Last paragraph is devoted to conclusion. 
 
 
 
 
 

 
2.  The index of DJIA 
 
DJIA is selected here, because its time domain is the longest and volume is largest of all the 
world  indices.  And  the  whole  history  of  DJIA,  (Fig.  1.)  from  01.10.1928  up  to  the  present, 
can  be  decomposed  into  five  main  epochs,  (utilizing  daily  real  data  in  [3])  each  with  a 
different length of duration, as: 

1: 

First  3,560  days  (around  Great  Depression)  till  about  01.01.1943  (χ=120.25). 

Transition and squezing the price are the main characteristics of this epoch. 

2:  

From 01.01.1943 (χ=120.25) till nearly 13.02.1964 (the 8854th day, χ=794.42). 
Duration  is  about  5,294  days.  Exponential  growth  with  the  exponent  (=β)  nearly  equal  to 
0.0003 day-1 is the main characteristic of this epoch. 

3:  

From 13.02.1964 till 01.01.1982 (13340th day χ=1000) Duration is about 4,488 
days. Oscillations with angular frequency (=w) equal to 0.0084 day-1 between 750 and 1,000 
levels is the main characteristic. 

From 01.01.1982 till 2000 crash (18000th day). Duration is about  4,660  days. 
This  epoch  consists  of  two  long  terms  (partial  epochs),  each  displaying  exponential  growth 
with  different  exponents  of  0.0005  (day-1)  between  01.01.1982  and  08.12.1994,  and  0.0008 
(day-1) afterwards till 2000 crash, all respectively.  

4:  

5:  

Current epoch. Rough constancy about the index level of 10,000 is the main 

characteristics of this epoch. 
   It is worth to note that, the pronounced epochs do not seperate from each other sharply, but 
some transition terms occur in general between them. 
 
 
   First  epoch  and  the  fundamental  line  of  DJIA:  Referring  to  Fig.  1.,  which  is  obtained 
utilizing daily real data in [3], the first epoch is the transitional period and lasted about 3,565 
days around Great Depression. The main characteristics of this epoch is triangular squeezing 
of  the  prices  with  the  climax  meeting  the  beginning  of  the  Sept.1929  crash  at  a  value  of 
381.17, which ended after about 700 days at a value of 41.22. Then a sharp rise occured till 
the value of about 200. Afterwards some decrease came reaching its deepest value at 92.92. 
These  two  successive  local  minima,  i.e.,  41.22  and  92.92  are  very  important  figures  in  the 
history  of  DJIA  since,  the  line  passing  through  them  defines  the  lower  rising  edge  of  the 
pronounced  triangle  and  moreover  the  rightward  extension  of  this  line  matches  with  the 
minima of prices for many decades, till the value increases to 1,000. (See, the longest straight 
line in Fig. 1.) The exponential increase, corresponding to the long straight line in Fig.1 is in 
fact worth to be considered as the fundamental line of DJIA, because of several reasons. First 
of  all,  this  line  can  be  taken  as  the  0th-order  approximation  for  the  index,  since  the 
corresponding time series is observed to evolve about (below and above of) it. Secondly the 
fundamental line, has played the role of supporting line till the date of 16.June.1989 (10,172th 
day).  The  day  after,  i.e.  at  17.June.1989  the  index  has  broken  down  from  it  (after  many 
previous  hits)  and  later  has  never  crossed  it.  Starting  in  Apr.1999  DJIA  has  approached  it 
from below many times, (at index values between 11,000 and 11,700) till the end of the same 
year, but has ceased to override it, and the last log-periodic crash has followed. (For detailed 
studies of this crash, in a power law formalism, see [4-23].) The log-linear slope of increase 
of the fundamental line is calculated to be β=ln(92.92/41.22)/(3390-946)=0.000333day–1. The 
0th-order  potential  energy  and  the  corresponding  equation  of  motion,  utilizing  the 
conservation of total energy, for DJIA may be written as  
 
 

Uzeroth-order = h2χ2 = – 0.5β2exp(2βt) + C   , 

(8) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(9) 

χ(t) zeroth-order = χ0exp(0.000333 t)   ,   

 
and 
 
 
 
respectively. In Eq. (8) the constant C takes care of the initial potential energy and it can be 
absorbed within U, and in Eq. (9), t0=0 is set, as can be done anew for each epoch. Note that, 
we have the price velocity and acceleration as v=βχ, and a=β2χ, respectively, and both also 
increase exponentially in time. The 0th-order force (and so, the acceleration) expression may 
also be written as F zeroth-order = –∂U/∂χ = (0.000333)2χ0exp(0.000333 t). Yet, it is obvious that 
the pronounced approximation can not be considered as a very successful one for the whole 
history of DJIA (Fig. 1.). 
   As a better approximation, one may try Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) onto index 
values. DFA is a common method in literature, widely used to eliminate effects of short-range 
fluctuations in computations. In DFA, the time series is considered segment by segment, and 
averages are computed by integrating prices over each segment and then dividing the result by 
the  length  of  time  duration.  In  the  present  application  of  DFA,  it  is  utilized  with  moving 
averages, where a linear-DFA with running average is performed. DFA line could barely be 
distinguished  from  the  real  data  and  is  thus  not  shown  in  Fig.1.  The  present  DFA  curve  is 
definitely not unique, i.e. infinitely many similars may be obtained on different criteria, such 
as accuracy wanted in results, limiting lengths of each segment to be less than a desired value, 
etc. (For the details and several applications of DFA, see [24-34].) 
 
 
   Second  epoch  and  psychological  resistances:  It  is  also  displayed  in  Fig.  1.  that, 
exponential rise in χ(t) survives till it reaches the value of 1,000, i.e., upto a “psychological 
resistance”. Many people believe that such round figures in share prices and index values play 
the role of resistance, and maybe their belief is what makes these figures resistive in reality. In 
any  case,  it  can  be  observed  that  there  already  exist  three  such  “round  resistance”  in  DJIA; 
namely,  100,  1,000  and  10,000  as  shown  (by  horizontal  lines  for  1,000  and  10,000 
resistances) in Fig. 1., around which price displays the habit of spending some thousand days. 
The second epoch, between the initial transition period and the 1,000 resistance level displays 
exponential growth as described in Eq. (9) with the potential energy given in Eq. (8), since the 
fundamental line passes through the minima of the second epoch. 
 
 
   Third  epoch:  The  term  taking  place  between  the  1,000  resistance  horizontal  line  and  the 
horizontal  line  at  the  level  of  750,  may  be  considered  as  being  composed  of  six  sinusoidal 
oscillations  with  a  period  of  T=750  day  (Fig.  2.).  This  period  corresponds  to  h2=  3.5x10-5 
(rad/day)2 of the Eq. (2), and with A from Eq.(6) taken as 125 lcu, its full expression may be 
written as 
 
 
 
where vav=0, (Eq. (6)), and t0 is taken at the date of 11.Apr.1963. It can be shown that, Eq. 
(10) is the resulting equation of motion with a positive h2 in the potential energy (Eq. (2)) of  
 
 
 

χ(t)epoch 3 = 875 + 125sin((2π/750)t  – π/2)  ,  

Uepoch 3 = h2 (χ(t)epoch 3 )2   ,

(13) 

χ(t)epoch 4 = χ0

epoch 4exp(0.0005 t)   , 

Uepoch 4 = –1.25x10-7exp(0.001 t)   ,   

where the constant term corresponding to χav = 875 lcu is absorbed in U. Then, total energy 
ET  can  be  calculated  as  ET  =½v2  +  ½(2h2)χ2  =2(πA/T)2  =  π2/18  =  0.55  (lcu/day)2,  which  is 
conserved throughout the whole epoch. 
   Oscillatory  epochs  end  up  with  an  abrupt  change,  in  general.  The  third  epoch,  surviving 
about  5,000  trading  days  (nearly  20  calender  years)  did  not  alter  the  “rule”,  and  terminated 
with an abrupt rise. And so, the third epoch is closed and the gate to the fourth one is opened. 
 
 
   Fourth epoch: We meet exponential rise again, with a steeper slope this time (arrow 2, in 
Fig. 1.), with 0.0005 lcu/day (=ln(3674.63/776.92)/(16,603-13,496). The equation of motion 
is 
 
 
 
epoch 4 may be taken as 776.92 at 12.Aug.1982 as the 13,494th day (counting from the 
where χ0
date  01.10.1928  on),  which  must  be  set  now  as  the  first  day  for  the  fourth  epoch. 
Corresponding potential energy becomes as 
 
 
 
where the constant term is dropped in usual manner. In fact, this epoch may be considered (in 
more details) as composed of two partial-epochs, with two different slopes, as discussed right 
after the beginning of this section. 
 
 
   The  final  (current)  epoch  is,  naturally,  the  most  interesting  one  of  all  considered  here, 
since it is not completed yet. Will it oscillate many times again as it did in the third epoch, or 
will it follow a different evolution nowadays? Certainly, nobody can answer this and similar 
questions with certainty. Yet, several scenarii may be proposed relying upon several criteria. 
   Firstly,  as  a  personal  feeling  it  may  be  phrased  that,  the  present  epoch  will  not  be  of 
sinusoidal oscillatory type. Because, the maximum of the second rise beginning in Apr2003 is 
below  the  previous  one  as  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  3.  Moreover,  the  second  maximum  is  much 
lower  than  the  first  one  in  S&P500  and  NASDAQ  too,  which  had  displayed  sinusoidal 
oscillations in the same time period with the third epoch of DJIA. Resting on this perspective, 
we  suggest  a  gravitational  potential  energy  of  the  form  U=h1χ  to  describe  the  current 
stituation. The general equation of motion deduced out of the given potential form is the Eq. 
(5). Utilizing the real data [6], we obtain (See Fig. 1 in [34]) 
 
 
 
 
 
for the first and second portions (with respect to the local minimum at the beginning of 2003), 
respectively. Notice that the gravitational acceleration of h1/2=–0.00606 lcu/day2 remains the 
same for both of the parts, i.e., full time domain (8 calender years) of the current epoch. 
   Is  this  an  accidental  result?  We  obtained  the  similar  constancy  of  the  acceleration  for 
S&P500, and NASDAQ (See Figs. 1-3 in [34]). So, the stituation may not be considered as 
accidental result, since it occurs in three different indices for sufficiently long time domains. 
   Within the existing perspective, one may imagine a price particle shot upward at a height of 
6415.3 lcu with an initial speed of (rounding the speed figures to two digits) 10.17 lcu/day in 

χ(t)epoch 5 =  7692.1 +  8.43 t – 0.00606 t2   ,    

χ(t)epoch 5 = 6415.3 + 10.17t – 0.00606 t2    , 

(14) 

 

 

 

 

a downward gravitational field of |h1|. It reaches the first maximum, which can be calculated 
2/(2|h1|),  the  very  familiar  formula  from  the  physics  of  particle 
utilizing  χmax  –  χ0  =  v0
kinematics.  Afterwards,  it  starts  to  fall  freely  back  to  the  initial  level,  and  strikes  with  the 
(initial) speed of 10.17 lcu/day. This collision may not be considered as an elastic one, since 
the departure (bouncing back) speed of 8.43 lcu/day is less than the original one, accounting 
to  30%  loss  in  kinetic  (and  total)  energy.  It  already  (at  the  date  of  March2005)  arrived  the 
second  maximum,  which  can  again  be  calculated  utilizing  the  equation  of  χmax  –  χ0  = 
2/(2|h1|), after substituting the new speed for v0. A new free fall back to 8,000’s at least, may 
v0
be  expected  within  the  coming  500  days...  Similar  interpretations  and  predictions  about 
S&P500 and NASDAQ may easily be developed as done in [34]. S&P500 and NASDAQ are 
expected  to  recede  back  in  500  days,  to  800’s  and  1,400’s,  respectively.  As  the  second 
scenario, it may be stated that, if a price squezing occurs below the line passing through the 
local maxima after 2000, DJIA may very well display a new transitional period in future of 
about some years, except for some short time periods. As the third scenario, DJIA may enter 
into a new sinusoidal oscillatory epoch about the 10,000 index level, for some years again, as 
it had sailed horizontally below the 1,000 level; provided it rises up sharply towards 12,000 
within a few months. In fact, this choice can be considered as a more consistent one with the 
previous  epochs,  (with  respect to,  constant  gravitational  acceleration  case,  especially)  since, 
oscillations  have  quadratic  potential  energy,  and  quadratic  potential  energy  is  the  dominant 
form  in  DJIA.  With  respect  to  any  of  the  three  scenarii  discussed  above,  DJIA  (and  so, 
S&P500 and NASDAQ) may be expected to fall in the coming months. 
 
 
Energy conservation in DJIA 
 
In the previous paragraphs, the given potential energies for each epoch were assumed without 
any proof, except that the resulting equations of motion suit well to describe the characteristic 
behavior  of  each  epoch.  By  utilizing  DFA  with  moving  averages,  we  calculated  fluctuation 
detrended price. And utilizing this price we calculated the kinetic and potential energies and 
their sum for each epochs. Many of the aspects of each DJIA epoch (except the first epoch, 
where not any potential energy expression is attained due to transition) may be overviewed in 
energy language. 
 
   Second  epoch:  Due  to  exponential  growth,  as  the  main  characteristics  of  this  epoch,    the 
potential  energy  is  quadratic  with  a  negative  factor,  which  is  equal  to  half  of  the  minus  the 
square  of  the  exponential.  And  the  total  energy  becomes  zero.  Utilizing  DFA  segments  
centered  at  each  t  (day),  we  obtained  that  total  energy  is  fluctuating  in  very  small  amounts 
about zero. As we approach to the next epoch the pronounced fluctuation increases. This term 
may be considered as the transition term between the second and the third epochs. The DFA 
segments utilized, have 100 days of half length, which are almost uniformly distributed on t. 
 
   Third  epoch:  Almost  sinusoidal  oscillations,  as  given  in  detail  in  Fig.  2.,  involve  a 
quadratic potential energy with a positive multiplier being equal to half of the square of the 
angular  frequency  associated.  So,  the  energy  is  nonzero  and  equal  to  0.55  (lcu2/day2),  as 
described in the paragraph just following Eq. (11) above. 
 
   Fourth epoch: Moving averages, (which could barely be distinguished from the real data 
and are thus not shown in Fig.3.) are obtained utilizing DFA with segments of half length 
equal to 500 days maximally, where the exponent is taken as equal to 0.0005 (day-1) for the 
whole epoch. (Yet, the time term after 01.01.1966 has a steeper increase, which is indicated 

by a thinner line of arrow 2 in Fig. 1. As a result, total energy calculated with the pronounced 
exponential, ceases to be valid in time term after 01.01.1966. 
 
   Fifth  epoch:  The  gravitational  potential  energy  involved  in  the  current  epoch  is  equal  to 
0.01212χ, where χ is measured with respect to the 7,500 level of index, since the epoch starts 
to take place there. Therefore, the total energy, being equal to gravitational potential energy at 
maximum  price  height,  is  about  36  (lcu2/day2).  The  outcoming  total  energy  in  our 
computations  is  found  to  be  fluctuating  in  small  amounts  about  the  level  of  36  (lcu2/day2), 
proving roughly the conservation. 
   In summary, we have the total energy as roughly conserved in each epoch, where the second 
and the fourth epochs involve zero and the third and the current epochs, non-zero and positive 
total energies. The moving average curve utilized in the present DFA analysis is not unique 
and  infinitely  many  of  similars  to  it  may  be  utilized  in  the  original  formalism.  So,  the 
proposed method is general and it is not constrained to any fittings, provided the characteristic 
parameters are given. Yet, if the pronounced parameters are utilized with wrong values, the 
correponding invalidity may be easily and directly detectable by the method. In this manner, 
one  may  even  scan  all  the  possible  values  for  each  parameter  in  blindfold  manner,  and 
investigating the outcoming results, one may pick up the correct values.

Fig. 1.  
DJIA,  with  logarithmic  price  axis.  Five  fundamental  epochs  composing  the 
history  can  be  selected.  The  first  “transitional”  epoch  is  characterized  by  its  triangular 
squeezing  the  price  about  the  first  “psychological  resistance”  of  the  value  of  100.  In  the 
second  and  the  fourth  epochs  log-linear  (i.e.,  exponential)  ascending  of  the  price  can  be 
distinguished  (arrows  1  and  2).  In  the  third  epoch,  just  below  the  second  “psychological 
resistance” of the value of 1,000 oscillations are dominant. In the fifth, and the final epoch, 
the evolution of formation (about the third “psychological resistance” of 10,000 index) is not 
completed yet.  
 
 
Fig. 2.  
The oscillatory third epoch of DJIA, taking place just below 1,000 and above 
750  index  values.  Sinusoidal  fit  may  not  be  considered  as  perfect,  yet  as  the  period  of  any 
oscillation elongates, the corresponding amplitude increases, and ET = 2(πA/T)2 remains the 
same. Oscillations terminate with an abrupt rise. 
 
 
 
Fig. 3.  
DJIA  about  the  Apr-Sep2000  climax  is  (ignoring  short-term  fluctuations) 
described by a rise and a fall of the price in a gravity h1/2= –0.00303 (lcu/day2). The initial 
(shooting) speed at the beginning of 1995 is v01= 10.17 (lcu/day). The price fall down after 
the  maximum  height  and  inelastically  bounces  back  with  v02=  8.43  (lcu/day)  in  the  same 
2/(2|h1|).  A 
gravity,  and  rises  up  to  11,000’s  in  accordance  with  the  expression  χ  –  χ0  =  v0
recession, back to 8,000’s and below is expected within the coming 500 days.

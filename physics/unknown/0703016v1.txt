1. INTRODUCTION
The problem of forced  convection along an isothermal,  constantly moving   plate is 
a classical problem of fluid mechanics that has been solved for the first time in 1961 
by  Sakiadis  (1961).  Thereafter,  many  solutions  have  been  obtained  for  different 
aspects  of  this  class  of  boundary  layer  problems.    Solutions  have  been  appeared 
including  mass  transfer,  varying  plate  velocity,  varying  plate  temperature,    fluid 
injection and fluid suction at the plate. The work by Hassanien  (1997) belongs to the 
above class of  problems, including a linearly varying velocity  and the variation of 
fluid viscosity with temperature. The author obtained similarity solutions considering 
that  viscosity  varies  as  an  inverse  function  of  temperature.  However,  the  Prandtl 
number,  which  is  a  function  of  viscosity,    has  been  considered  constant  across  the 
boundary layer. It has been already confirmed in the literature that the assumption of 
constant Prandtl  number  leads  to unrealistic results   (Pantokratoras, 2004, 2005).   
The  objective  of  the present     paper  is  to  obtain    results considering both viscosity 
and   Prandtl number variable across the boundary layer. As will be shown later the 
differences of the two methods are very large in some cases. 

2. THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL
Consider  the flow along a  moving plate placed in a calm environment with u and v 
denoting respectively the velocity components in the x and y direction, where x is the 
coordinate  along  the  plate  and  y  is  the  coordinate  perpendicular  to  x.    For  steady, 
two-dimensional flow the boundary layer equations including variable viscosity  are

where  T  is  the  fluid  temperature,    μ    is  the  dynamic  viscosity,  α  is  the  thermal 
diffusivity,  and  ρa is the ambient fluid density. 
The boundary conditions are as  follows:

at   y = 0      U=bx, v=0, T=Tw                                                                                 (4)           
as  y →      u =0, T = Ta                                                            (5)

where Tw  is the plate  temperature,  Ta   is the ambient fluid temperature and bx is the 
velocity of the moving surface. 
     The viscosity is assumed to be an inverse linear function of temperature  given by 
the following equation  (Hassanien  1997)

where c=γ/μa and  Te =Ta -1/γ  are constants and their values depend on the reference 
state and the thermal property of the fluid.                                                     
     The equations (1), (2) and (3) form a parabolic system and were solved directly, 
without  any  transformation,  by  a  method  described  by  Patankar  (1980).  The  finite 
difference  method  is  used  with  primitive  variables  x,  y  and  a  space  marching 
procedure is used in x direction with an expanding grid. A detailed description of the 
solution procedure may be found in Pantokratoras (2002) where all  fluid properties ( 
viscosity,  thermal  diffusivity  and  density)  have  been  considered  as  functions  of 
temperature.

It  should be  mentioned  here that  when θe → the  fluid viscosity becomes equal  to 
ambient viscosity.  
     In  order  to  test  the accuracy of  the  present  method, results were  compared  with 
those  available in the literature. The wall heat transfer θ'(0) and the wall shear stress 
f''(0) for the present problem with constant viscosity and Pr =0.7 are –0.454449 and –
1.0  respectively  (Abo-Eldahab  and  El  Aziz  2004).    The  corresponding  quantities 
calculated  by  the  present  method  are  –0.4541  and  –1.0.  The  comparison  is 
satisfactory and this happens  for other  Pr numbers.   
   In  contrast  to  the  above    direct  solution  of  equations  (1),  (2)  and  (3),  Hassanien 
(1997) transformed these equations  into the following similarity equations

It should be mentioned here that in the transformed energy equation (15) the Prandtl 
number has been assumed constant across the boundary layer. Hassanien (1997) have 
calculated this Prandtl number  at ambient temperature from the following equation

                                                                                                                     (16) 

However, the Prandtl number is a function of viscosity and as viscosity varies across 
the    boundary  layer,  the  Prandtl  number  varies,  too.    As  will  be  shown  below  this 
assumption leads to unrealistic results in some cases. 
    In  table  1    the  wall  shear  stress  and  the  wall  heat  transfer are  given  for  ambient 
Prandtl  number  0.7.  In  the  table  the  results  by  Hassanien  (1997)    have  been  also 
included for comparison. In the last column of  the  table  the Prandtl  number at the 
plate (Prw) is included.

From table 1 it is seen that the wall shear stress, calculated by  the two methods, are 
in  agreement.    For  wall  heat  transfer  things  are  different.  For  large  values  of  the 
parameter |θe| the results are in agreement but as |θe|  decreases the results of the two 
methods diverge. It is advocated here that the wall heat transfer  for Pra=0.7 and low   
|θe|  calculated by Hassanien are unrealistic.  In figure 1 the temperature profiles are
shown  for  Pra=0.7  and  θe  =-0.01  and  –0.025.  It  is  seen  that  the  real  temperature 
profiles,  calculated  with    variable  Pr  number,  are  much  wider  than  those  given  by 
Hassanien  (1997)  calculated  with  constant  ambient  Pr  number.    The  error  is 
introduced by considering that the ambient Pr number is valid in the entire boundary
layer but this is  valid only for large values of  |θe|. For low values of of  |θe|  the real 
Pr  number  inside  the  boundary  layer  is  much smaller  than  the  ambient one  as  it  is 
shown in figure 2.  From  table 1  we see that   for  θe =-0.01 the Prandtl  number at 
the plate is 100 times smaller than  the ambient one. It is well known in the boundary 
layer theory that large Pr numbers correspond to  “narrow” temperature profiles and 
small Pr numbers to  wider  temperature profiles. This is the reason for the difference 
in the temperature profiles and the wall heat transfer between the two methods.

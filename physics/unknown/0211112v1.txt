Abstract 
 
 In this paper a general and unified treatment of the DQE is exposed, both in the space-domain and in the 
frequency-domain. The meaning of the DQE as quantum efficiency appears to be of paramount importance 
for  a  correct  interpretation  of  the  physical  parameters  involved  in  its  formulation  and  measurement. The 
treatment in the frequency-domain turns out to be a direct extension of  that in the space-domain. 
 An operational procedure is introduced  to consider the effect of the filtering of the detector in the space-
domain. 
 
1.  Introduction 
  
 The detective  quantum  efficiency  (DQE)  is  a  parameter  introduced  to  assess  the 
varying levels of performance of imaging detectors with the aim of comparing their 
imaging capabilities by an unified approach [1][2].  
  Despite  its  being  widespread,  this  parameter  is  not  generally  well  understood  and 
consequently it is not well measured or used. 
 As we shall see, various and subtle problems appear in the concept, the formulation, 
and in the appropriate use of the DQE.  
 The words "quantum efficiency" have a precise meaning, because the DQE measures 
the quantum efficiency of an  equivalent virtual detector which produces at its output 
the  same  signal-to-noise  ratio  of  the  real  detector  even  when  the  input  signal  is  the 
same.  
 In this context the  quantum efficiency  (QE) of a detector is intended as the  average 
fraction  of  the  input  quanta  which  is  used  in  the  formation  of  the  output  signal, no 
matter if the single input quantum generates a distinct output signal or not.  
 The DQE is generally defined by the ratio of the squared output signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNRo)2 to the  squared input signal-to-noise ratio (SNRi) 2  of the imaging detector. 
This definition of the DQE, in accordance with the exact meaning of the terms used, 
is, however, a consequence of its primary meaning of quantum efficiency.  
The  discussion  which  follows  will  be  carried  out  at  first  within  the  space-domain, 
since the DQE treatment in the spatial frequency-domain is an extension of concepts 
established in the more familiar space-domain.  
 The DQE formulation in the spatial  frequency-domain is useful for highlighting the 
detector  capabilities  at  a  done  spatial  frequency  for  a  done  input  signal.  The  DQE 
expressed in the  space-domain reveals the efficiency of the detector as depending on

the input signal. In any case, as we shall see, the DQE expressed in the space-domain 
can also be affected by the spatial resolution of the detector. 
 
 
 
 
2. The quasi-ideal imaging detector 
 
  A  good  understanding  of  the  DQE  is  impossible  without  having  as  a  reference  the 
"virtual"  detector  termed    quasi-ideal by R.C. Jones [2].  This  quasi-ideal imaging 
detector  only  has  noise  due  to  the  input  Poisson  statistics  and  to  the  fluctuations 
introduced by the binomial statistics due to a QE < 1 [3].  These two noises are not 
correlated, so the noise variance at the output of a  quasi-ideal imaging detector will 
be:

 Supposing the ergodicity of the various signals and noises, any single measurement 
can be executed  irrespective of the space domain or the time domain. In other words, 
if the signals refer to a single pixel, the averaging operation and the fluctuations from 
the mean must be conceived within the time. On the contrary, when we operate only 
on a single frame the averaging operation and the variance measurement are intended 
among the various pixels. 
 The introduction of the squared SNRs allows us to discover a  key  property of the 
quasi-ideal  imaging detectors. In fact

These elementary operations are very important because they contain the concept of 
DQE. 
  It  is  necessary  to  keep  in  mind  that  in  the  equation  (5)  the  noises  are  intended  as 
fluctuations (in quanta) with respect to an average summation of input quanta ( iS ) or 
. 
of output quanta 
 
3.  The real imaging detector 
          
 A real imaging detector has adjunctive noise sources (of variance 
ns ) and adjunctive 
backgrounds, compared to a quasi-ideal detector. In this case, being as the noises are 
not correlated, 
  
                                                
 
 The QE of a real detector is the same as the corresponding  quasi-ideal detector. In 
oS ,    the  backgrounds  must  be  subtracted  from  the  average  output 
fact,  to  obtain 
oS  
because  they  are  steady  quantities.  Instead,  the  noises  do  not  interfere  with 
because they have zero means.  
Therefore, for a real detector

Consequently,  our  real  detector  has  a  smaller  SNRo  than  that  of  the  corresponding 
quasi-ideal detector (which has  same QE and same SNRi). 
 We can conclude that the equation (5) cannot represent the QE of a real detector, but 
rather the QE of the equivalent  quasi-ideal detector which has same SNRo and same 
SNRi as the real detector. This equivalent QE is the DQE: 

oS  is a variance measured by quanta2.

 In practice, the performance of any real imaging detector is translated by DQE into 
that  of  the  equivalent  quasi-ideal  detector,  so  the  imaging  capabilities  of  different 
detectors  can  be  effectively  compared.  Obviously,  QE  and  DQE  of  quasi-ideal  
detectors are coincidental.           
 Using the equation (8), DQE can be written  in the following manner:

  Unlike  QE,  the  DQE  is  not  a  simple  constant  characteristic  of  the  detector,  and 
depends not only on QE,  but also on the average input signal 
iS  (the variance of the 
ns   of  the  adjunctive  noise  of  the  imaging 
input Poisson noise) and on the variance 
detector.  
 From equation (10) stems the relation: 
 
                                                        
 
 It  can  be  demonstrated  that  the  knowledge  of  the  DQE  is  equivalent  to  the 
knowledge  of  other  parameters  of  an  imaging  detector  like  the detectable minimum 
signal difference, the  maximum number of resolvable grey levels, and the  detectable 
minimum contrast [4].

possibilities, assuming that the saturation value of 
 Curve A considers the case of QE = 0.8 and  
detector with the same QE, but with 
0,3 with the value of  
quanta2. 
  These  plots  indicate  that  at  high  input  signals  the  DQE  is  determined  only  by  QE 
while, at low 

ns  = 105 quanta2. Curve B pertains a 
ns  = 10 quanta2. Curve C treats the case of QE = 
ns  = 103 

ns  = 0.1 quanta2 and curve D the case of QE = 1 with 

iS , the adjunctive detector noise plays a relevant role.  

iS  is  108 quanta.

 Plot  C  of  Fig.1  is  emblematic  insofar  as  at  low 
performance, while at high 
worst performance).  
  Concluding,  in  the  interest  of  obtaining  the  highest  DQE,  we  can  operate  on  three 
parameters: QE, 
iS , as shown in equation (10). In any case, the improvement 
ns  and 
of QE is always convenient if we maintain  
 Conversely, at low values of 
ns  can dominate (improving the 
DQE) in the presence of a contemporary lowering of QE (see plot C vs. plots A, B, 
D). 
 In practice, the selection of the right detector requires the preliminary knowledge of 
iS , that is the rate of the input quanta and the integration time. Thereafter, once 
iS  is 
known we can verify if the DQE of our detector is satisfactory. On the contrary, it is 
interesting  to  see  in  Fig.1  how  the  comparison  of  different  imaging  systems 
performed only at a single value of 
 
5. The single quantum detection 
  
 It  is  a  common  conviction  that  a  detector  with  sensitivity  heightened  to  detect  a 
single input quantum has the best DQE, especially if QE = 1. This opinion ignores the 
fact  that  an  image  is  built  by  a  summing  of  events,  or  that  the  effect  of    the 
"additional"  noises  which  determine 
ns     can  influence  the  DQE,  as  shown  by 
equation (10). 
The  detection  of  the  single  input  quanta  is  necessary  only  when  a  decision  must  be 
reached on the basis of the intensity or timing of  the signal generated by the single 
event. In any case, the detection of single quanta in "counting" detectors can limit the 
rate of the detector itself, because generally in this type of detectors the concomitant 
events cannot be resolved spatially. 
 When  a  "counting"  detector  detects  a  fraction  of  the  input  quanta  during  an 
integration time, 
ns  derives from the fluctuations of the "spurious" events produced 
by spikes of the "additional" noise which exceed the acceptance threshold. 
 When  the  threshold  level  is  maintained  high,  to  avoid  the  "spurious"  events,  a  QE 
loss  may  appear  due  to  the  intrinsic  fluctuations  of  the  single  event  signals.  In  this 
latter case 
  The variance

 The counting of the single events is also possible using "integrating" detectors if the 
spots generated at the detector output by the single input quanta can be detected and 
spatially resolved within a frame by a pattern recognition procedure. A further image 
analysis  is necessary to determine the pixel which is the "centroide" of these spots.  
The  final  image  is  obtained  using  these  pixels  as  counts  by  adding  together  the 
content of consecutive frames.

6.  How does an image intensifier work? 
 
 Contrary to its name, an image intensifier does not always improve the DQE of an 
imaging detector. In some circumstances, the use of an image intensifier can worsen 
the DQE of the detector, especially at high values of 
  For  example,  the  C  curve  in  Fig.1  can  pertain  the  DQE  of  an  intensified  imaging 
detector, where the image intensifier is used with the aim of raising the DQE at low 
iS .    In  this  detector  a  QE  of  0.3  is  likely  because  the  image  intensifier  has  a 
photocathode  at  its  input  and,  as  we  know,  the  quantum  efficiency  of  the 
photocathode is low. 
  Numerical  examples  of  DQE  calculations  in  intensified,  or  non  intensified,  CCD 
imaging detector can be found in reference [6]. 
 With reference to equation (10), the raising of the DQE in spite of the lowering of 
QE and of 
ns . The image intensifier operates in exactly the 
ns   (expressed  in  quanta2)  this  is  because  it  "intensifies"  the 
same  way  reducing   
signal due to the single input quantum.   
 
7.  The analog integration of events 
 
 When signals and noises are integrated in analog form in an "integrating" detector, 
the variance of the "adjunctive" noise is

 Using equation (12), equation (10) becomes:

 Therefore, in the "integrating" detectors we always have DQE < QE.

 The best imaging procedure using an "integrating" detector would be the analysis of 
the spots (if detected) generated by the input quanta, as described in paragraph 5 and 
practically using the "integrating" detectors as "counting" detectors. 
  
8.  Spatial resolution and DQE of the detector 
 
S =
oS  represents how much 
 The equation

iS  are detected, apart from the average area (pixel2) covered by 
of the input quanta 
the signals relating to 
oS . This area is the circular portion of the detector output frame 
determined by scattering and/or diffusion phenomena due to the secondary products  
generated by each single input quantum. 
iS  is generally referred to one pixel, so the average area  n  (pixel2) covered by the 
 
oS   represents  the  minimum  area    which  can  be  resolved  by  the 
events pertaining 
ns  and of 
detector.    This  area  is  very  important  because  it  determines  the  value  of 
ds . 
 In fact, Fig. 2 clearly shows, if 
per pixel in the "counting" detectors and 
per pixel in the "integrating" detectors  
 
                                    
 
Therefore, SNRo , and then DQE  depend on  n . 
 The average area  n  is related to the spatial resolution of the detector expressed by 
the MTF, which is the module of the Optical Transfer Function (OTF) of the system 
[7].  
 Fig.2 shows the line pairs of a square-wave pattern placed at the  input of the detector 
and as it is viewed at the output when the line pairs are barely resolved sufficiently.  
 The line pairs of Fig.2 have the frequency limit flim , that is the maximum number of 
line pairs per millimetre (lp/mm) which can be spatially resolved by the detector. In 
fact, the circular spot of average area  n   contains  exactly  one  pair  of  these  lines  of 
frequency flim.

 The square-wave  pattern  pertains  the  so-called  Contrast  Transfer  Function  (CTF) 
instead  of  the  sine-wave pattern which connects the MTF, but for our purposes the 
result obtained by the CTF is practically the same as that by the MTF [8]. 
 The spatial frequency flim corresponds to that in which the CTF (or the MTF) reaches 
the zero value. Therefore,  if pixel of the detector are squares (the pixel size Dx = Dy), 
the average area   n , will be:

 9. The DQE in the frequency-domain 
 
 The passage from the  space-domain to the  frequency-domain can take place by the 
introduction of the power spectral density, or simply the power spectrum (also called 
the Wiener spectrum), which is the average power of the signal (or of the noise) in a 
unitary bandwidth centred at the frequency f. 
Therefore, we can decide the calculation or the measurement of the DQE in function 
of the spatial frequencies  f
  It  is  convenient  to  write  equation  (9)  according  to  equation  (8)  and  (10)  in  the 
following manner:

10. Conclusions 
 
 In this paper the DQE of the imaging detectors has been treated under the point of 
view of a quantum efficiency, both in the space-domain and in the frequency-domain. 
The  meaning  of  quantum  efficiency  of  the  DQE  is  essential  for  a  correct 
interpretation of the involved parameters in its formulation and measurement. 
 The treatment of the DQE in the frequency-domain turns out to be a consequence of 
that in the space-domain. 
 An operational procedure has been exposed to consider the filtering of the detector 
also in the space-domain.

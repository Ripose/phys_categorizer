Abstract

We report that liquids perform self-propelled motion when they are placed in contact

with hot surfaces with asymmetric (ratchet-like) topology. The pumping effect is

observed when the liquid is in the film-boiling regime, for many liquids and over a wide

temperature range. We propose that liquid motion is driven by a viscous force exerted

by vapor flow between the solid and the liquid.

The ability to control the dynamics of liquids is crucial in applications such as lab-on-a-

chip technology, ink-jet printing, thermal management, spray cooling and painting. It

has previously been observed that millimeter-scale liquid droplets on substrates can

move spontaneously due to an imbalance of surface tension forces (the Marangoni

effect) [1-3], caused by a chemical [4-10], thermal [4, 11, 12], or electrical [13]

gradient.  In these systems, hysteresis forces [3] due to the wetting contact between

droplet and surface limit the droplet speed to a few mm/s, unless additional power is

supplied [14]. The resulting displacement is usually a few centimetres or less, because a

finite gradient along the direction of motion is needed. Here we report self-propelled

film-boiling droplets, which are separated from the supporting solid by a lubricating

vapor layer. Droplet motion is driven by a thermal gradient perpendicular to the

direction of motion, and is controlled by a saw tooth shaped substrate topology, without

the need for a gradient along the flow direction (Movie 1). Millimeter-sized droplets

accelerate at rates of up to 1 – 2 m/s2, can climb against inclines, and sustain speeds of

order 5 cm/s over distances up to a meter. We propose that droplet motion is due to a

viscous force exerted by vapor flow between the droplet and the asymmetric surface.

Figure 1(a) shows a sequence of video images demonstrating droplet motion

perpendicular to the thermal gradient that powers the liquid motion. A droplet of

refrigerant R134a (1,1,1,2 tetrafluorethane, boiling point Tb = - 26.1 °C) was placed on a

room-temperature, brass surface that was milled into a periodic, ratchet-like topology.

The droplet is observed to move perpendicular to the ratchet features (in positive x-

direction in Fig. 1(a)), reaching a terminal speed of several cm/s. The motion is

sustained over the entire structured surface area, limited only by the evaporation time of

the droplet (several tens of seconds). No external force or gradient (other than the

vertical temperature difference between solid and liquid) is applied. We have observed

- 2 -

this effect for all liquids we have investigated (including nitrogen, acetone, methanol,

ethanol, water, and hexadecane, with boiling points ranging from – 196 °C to + 151 °C),

provided the ratchet temperature is above the liquid’s Leidenfrost point TL (about 20 °C

for R134a on brass), where a vapor layer levitates the droplet. The effect is observed

independent of the ratchet material and its precise geometry in the size ranges we have

investigated (1 mm < s < 3 mm, 0.1 mm < d < 0.3 mm; see Fig. 1(a)).

Figure 2(a) shows the time evolution of the velocity of R134a droplets (radius r ≈

1.5 mm, comparable to the liquid’s capillary length κ-1 = (γ/ρg)1/2 = 1.1 mm, where γ =

15.5 mN/m is the liquid’s surface tension at Tb, ρ = 1377 kg/m3 is the mass density at

Tb, and g is the gravitational acceleration) on a horizontally levelled brass ratchet.

Droplets were given an initial velocity v0 before entering the ratchet (5 x 18 cm2). The

droplet trajectory was recorded using a video camera (frame rate 30/s), digitized using

the software VideoPoint (Lenox, MA), and the velocity’s x-component vx was

calculated. Droplets that initially move in the negative x-direction in Fig. 1 (v0x < 0) turn

around and accelerate until they reach a terminal velocity vt (see Fig. 2(a) and Movies 3

and 4). The vx(t) data fit the equation

which, for a droplet of mass m, is the solution of the equation of motion

€ 

 m(dvx/dt) = -βvx(t) + F, with a velocity-dependent drag force (-βvx), a positive, constant

accelerating force F = ma, and resulting terminal velocity vt = a/(β/m). v0x, a and β/m

are fit parameters.

In Figs. 2(b-d), we show results for droplets of R134a, ethanol (Tb = 78.5 °C, γ =

18.2 mN/m, ρ = 727 kg/m3, κ-1 = 1.6 mm), and water (γ = 58.9 mN/m, ρ = 957 kg/m3,

- 3 -

κ-1 = 2.5 mm), respectively, as a function of the superheat ∆T = (TR – Tb), where TR is

the ratchet temperature (determined using NiCr/NiAl thermocouples inserted into

horizontal, 2 mm wide holes approximately 4 mm underneath the ratchet surface). For

each liquid, two temperature regimes can be distinguished. At temperatures within

about 20 – 50 °C above the onset of self-propelled motion (Regime L), we find the

highest accelerations (up to 1 –2 m/s2), and the highest values for the drag parameter

β/m. However, the results in Regime L vary from droplet to droplet, and the velocity of

individual droplets can fluctuate significantly (see inset to Fig. 2(a)). At higher

temperatures (Regime H), we observe significantly lower a and β/m, and much smaller

fluctuations.

We speculate that in Regime L droplets on a ratchet are not fully in the film-

boiling regime, and nucleate boiling events introduce fluctuations. This interpretation is

supported by our observation that in Regime L the ratchet-cleaning method influences

the droplet dynamics (Fig. 2 (b-c)), and by the fact that a liquid’s Leidenfrost point is

known to vary substantially with surface roughness and contamination [15, 16]. In

Regime H, however, we find that surface contamination has little influence on a and

β/m, consistent with the liquid and substrate being fully separated by a vapor layer.

The orientation of the ratchet plane relative to gravity is not critical: droplets or

slugs placed in a flat-bottomed, open channel (width 2-4 mm) with ratcheted, vertical

side walls, accelerate against significant inclines, with the effect becoming stronger with

decreasing channel width (Movie 5). This observation suggests that the role of gravity is

limited to keeping the liquid in contact with the ratchet.

For ratchet periods s ≈ 1 - 2 mm we do not observe motion for droplets with

radius r < 0.3 s. Droplets spanning multiple s do accelerate (Movies 5 and 6), but

puddles tend to break up into smaller droplets once r exceeds several κ−1. If confined

- 4 -

into a channel we observe acceleration of slugs tens of millimetres in length, interacting

with many ratchet periods simultaneously (Movie 5).

To explain our observations, we propose that an asymmetry in the vapor-flow

pattern underneath the droplet, induced by the substrate topology, exerts a viscous force

on the droplet. In the following we present a model based on this notion.

A droplet placed on a ratchet (see Fig. 3(a)) tends to curve concavely around the

tops of the ridges (point A) while assuming a convex shape elsewhere. This variation in

droplet curvature implies a pressure differential along the vapor layer as explained in

the following. The local difference between the droplet’s internal pressure pi (assumed

constant along the bottom surface) and the pressure in the vapor film is given

approximately by the Laplace pressure ∆p = γ/R, where R is the local radius of the

curvature (assuming no curvature parallel to the ratchet ridges) [3]. A concave surface

shape (near point A) corresponds to a curvature RA < 0 and pA > pi, while the convex

curvature at points B1 and B2 implies RB > 0 and pB < pi, such that pA > pB. We therefore

expect net vapor flow from point A to points B1 and B2. Flow from A to B2 is expected

to create a viscous force in forward direction, which we estimate below. In contrast,

vapor flowing from A “backward” can escape sideways along the wide ratchet grooves

(into and out of the page in Fig. 3(a)), because of the small flow resistance in this

direction [17]. Therefore, net forces due to vapor flow between A and B1 should be

relatively small.

The force exerted by the vapor on the liquid between points A and B2 has two

components. First, a forward shear force due to Poiseuille vapor flow caused by the

pressure differential ∆P = (pA – pB). Using nonslip boundary conditions and a parallel-

plate model, the horizontal component of this force is [18]

- 5 -

F = 0.5 Aeff h |dP/dx| cosθ

where Aeff is the total area over which this force contributes (depending on droplet size,

multiple ratchet periods are involved), h is the thickness of the vapor layer in this area,

and θ is defined in Fig. 3(b). Second, if the droplet glides with vx relative to the

substrate there is a viscous drag force given by [18]

 (2)

(3)

- βvx = - (η Aeff/h) vx 

where η is the vapor’s viscosity.

In Fig. 4(a) we show measured values of a for water droplets as a function of their

volume V. For droplets that are too small to cover about three full ratchet periods (r <

1.5 s, where s = 1.5 mm), there is considerable scatter in the data. We therefore focus

on the range V > 50 µl (r > 2.3 mm) when we compare data and model in the following.

To calculate a from Eq. (2), we estimate the fraction 

α = Aeff / Ac , where Ac(V) = (5/4)

κ1/2 V5/6 is the droplet’s volume-dependent contact area [19], by measuring the distance l

between points of type A and B2 in high-resolution photographs of droplets with r ≈ 1.5
€ 

s and find α ≈ 0.6 for water. The value of h is typically 10 – 100 µm on flat surfaces

[20, 21], but varies with position on a ratchet surface (see Fig. 3(a)). We determine h

from the measured values for β/m using Eq. (3), neglecting contributions to the drag

force from areas outside Aeff = αAc(V). We find that h varies weakly with droplet size

for V > 50 µl (see Fig. 4 (b)) and use the averaged value in this range, h = 10.2 µm, for

the further analysis. We determine RA and RB from high-resolution photographs to find

pressure gradients dP/dx ≈ (pA – pB)/l of order 102 Pa/mm [22], confirming that the

hydrostatic variations in pi of order of ρgd/s ≈ 3 Pa/mm are negligible.

The droplet acceleration a = F/m of water droplets as a function of V derived from Eq.

(2) is plotted in Fig. 4(a), along with the observed data. The model quantitatively agrees

- 6 -

with the data within the uncertainty of the calculation, which is mainly due to error in α,

RA, RB, and h. Note that the expression for Ac(V) used here [19], as well as expressions

proposed more recently [21], assume circular droplets, while our droplets are typically

elongated in the x-direction. This may account for why the model deviates from the data

for larger droplets (r > 3 mm) which are more likely to elongate. Consistent with

experiment, the model predicts that droplets with r < 0.5 s, for which no curvature

differentials are expected, should not accelerate. For droplets with s ≈ r, the droplet

curvature changes with time in a complex manner, which may explain the scatter in the

data for a in this range.

The above model is relevant to Regime H. We propose that in Regime L nucleate

boiling occurs near the ratchet ridges, explaining the occasionally observed high values

of β/m (hysteresis forces during wetting events introduce additional drag), and of a (due

to the additional bursts of vapor flow). Nucleate boiling may also contribute to the

acceleration of a liquid nitrogen droplet across the edge of a piece of tape (VWR

scientific tape) placed on a brass surface (see Fig. 1(b) and Movie 8). We observe no

acceleration when we use a brass step of equal height, and propose that vapor flow

associated with a nucleate boiling event at the tape edge (which is expected to cool

much faster than brass, promoting nucleate boiling) exerts a forward force on the

droplet (see Fig. 3(c)).

Thermocapillary flow [3] along the droplet’s bottom surface may also be

important. For instance, during a nucleate boiling event at a tape edge (Fig. 1(b)), the

liquid surface closest to the wetting point is likely to be heated above Tb, inducing

thermocapillary flow along the x-direction, away from the wetting point (Fig. 3(c)). Due

to the broken symmetry at the step this may result in net pumping action, with the

hysteresis forces at the wetting point providing a reaction force. A similar mechanism

may be at work in periodic ratchets in Regime L. In Regime H, where frictional forces

- 7 -

between liquid and solid are almost absent, a mechanism for direct momentum

exchange between solid and liquid is less obvious, but may occur when the ratchet

topology forces a change in the direction of thermocapillary flow (at point B in Fig.

3(b)). We speculate that by relying on thermocapillary flow it may be possible to use a

ratchet-like topology to propel droplets at TR < TL if a ratchet with superhydrophobic

coating is used to mitigate friction.

The ratchet effect [23] reported here may be used to construct pumps consisting

of channels with ratchet-shaped inner walls. Such ratchet pumps could be powered by

waste heat, making them attractive for use in millimeter-scale closed loop, two-phase

cooling systems with no moving parts and no external power need, for example for

microprocessor cooling. It remains to be explored whether the pumping is sustained for

ratchet dimensions below the millimeter-scale, enabling microfluidic applications.

The basic features of the vapor flow pattern described here are confirmed by

visualization of the vapor flow using glitter particles (see Movie 7). In particular,

we observe net vapor flow in the forward direction. This observation supports

the model proposed here, but is not consistent with, for instance, a type of

rocket-propulsion mechanism where the droplet experiences a reaction force due

to momentum outflow carried by the vapor.

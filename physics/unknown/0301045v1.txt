The  problem  of  determination  of  the  maximum  of  second  harmonic  generation  in  the
potential  well  containing  a  rectangular  barrier  is  considered.  It  is  shown  that,  in  general,  the
problem of finding the ensemble of structures with equidistant first three levels has two types of
solutions.  For  the  first  type  the  second  and  third  energy  levels  are  located  above  a  rectangular
barrier, and for the second type the third level is located above the barrier only. It is also shown,
that generation corresponding to the second type of solution always is less than generation for the
first  one.  Taking  into  account  the  effective  mass  changes  the  problem  of  finding  the  generation
maximum for a finite depth well is exactly solved.

1.  Introduction

  Thanks  to  the  recent  progresses  in  epitaxy  technology,  the  fabrication  of  ultra-

thin  layered  systems  from  semiconductor  materials  with  various  values  of  width  of  the

forbidden  bands  and  electronic  affinity  has  become  possible.  To  get  the  required

characteristics  of  various  one-electronic  devices,  heterostructures  from  two  wells  of

GaAs  dividing by a potential barrier of  AlAs  is usually used [1-3]. It is well known that

in  symmetric  wells  the  selection  rule  takes  place,  and  overlapping  integrals  for  states

belonging to different subband of quantized spectrum are equal to zero or unit. However,

in  many  interesting  cases  the  quantum  wells  with  a  complex  structure  or  simple  wells

made  asymmetric  by  application  of  electric  field  are  examined.  In  these  cases  the

selection rule is broken, this leads to changes the radiation and absorption conditions for

light in such systems.

 As it is known in the semiconductor size-quantized structures, the dipole matrix

elements  have  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  the  quantum  well  width  (a  few

nanometers). The last leads to extremely large nonlinear susceptibility for such structures

in comparison with molecular and ionic systems, in which the dipole matrix elements are

about  few  picometers.  As  a  result  of  the  subband  and  band  -  to  -  band  transitions,  the

problem  of  second  harmonic  generation  (SHG)  for  an  electromagnetic  radiation  in  the

1

infra-red  region  of  wavelengths,  recently  the  study  of  every  possible  asymmetric  low-

dimensional structures having equidistantly located energy levels has been the subject of

considerable attention [4-12].

 The intersubband SHG coefficient is given by [13]:

studies of  the SHG focus on the so-called double  resonance regime, when in  the  three-

level  system  the  generation  coefficient  is  maximal.  In  this  case  the  system’s  levels  are
located equidistantly and the photon energy  ω

asymmetric  potential  only,  since  in  that  case  all  dipole  matrix  elements  are  differ  from

.

For the given configuration of confinement potential at the double resonance the

SHG  can  be  maximized  by  means  of  variation  of  structure  parameters.  To  do  this  it  is

necessary  except  the  determination  of  the  ensemble  of  structures  with  given  value  of

levels equidistant to determine the such structure, for which the product of dipole matrix

elements  is  maximum.  In  the  general  case,  the  determination  of  optimal  confinement

potential is a very difficult nonlinear variation problem. Moreover, both the structural and

material parameters of the optimal potential depend on the radiation frequency.

 In  papers  [13,  14]  the  problem  of  determination  of  the  SHG  maximum  was

considered for an infinite deep well containing a rectangular barrier directly adjoining to

the  wall  of  the  well.  Regarding  to  the  above  mentioned  papers  for  the  given  type  of

asymmetric potential the procedure of determination of optimal structure can be done at

once for all wavelengths. The last has allowed definition of the structure constructing on

with rather large coefficient of SHG in the infra-red

region of frequencies and to experimentally observe the generation. At the same time the

authors of papers [13, 14] did not receive optimal parameters for finite depth well. As our

consideration shows for the well chosen in papers [13, 14] for experimental observation

of  SHG  the  condition  of  equidistant  energy  levels  does  not  take  place.  Moreover,  for

exact realization of the structure one has to take into account the effective mass changes

in the different areas of the heterostructure also.

 This paper is devoted to the problem of determination of optimal parameters for

the structure, presenting the finite depth well containing a rectangular barrier adjoining to

the one wall of the well, which give the maximum value for the SHG coefficient taking

into account the effective mass changes.

2. The maximum of the SHG coefficient for infinite deep quantum well

 Let us consider the problem of finding the possible values of parameters for the

infinite  deep  well  with  adjoining  to  the  one  wall  rectangular  barrier,  for  the  which  the

first three energy levels are equidistantly located from each other. The potential has the

form of:

To solve the formulated problem we shall consider the equation determining the

electron energy spectrum for potential (1). Without taking into account the effective mass

changes this equation looks like [15]

At  any  fixed  value  of  x   Eq.  (6)  -  (8)  can  be  considered  as  the  set  from  three
1e ,  ∆   and  u .  As  consideration

transcendental  equations  for  three  unknown  parameters 

shows the set (6) - (8) has solutions for values  x  more than

 only. For each

value  of  x   there  are  two  collections  of  the  quantities 

u

  satisfying  the  set  of

e ∆

equations (6) - (8). So, for example, at 

41.0=x

 we have {3.0729, 7.9236, 8.9329} and

{3.2696,  8.8434,  12.2986}.  Each  of  collection  of  the  quantities 

e ∆
,{ 1

u
},

  represents  a

separate type of solution for the  equations  (6) -  (8).  In  the  figure 1  for  the first  type  of

solution we plot the dependencies of quantities

 and  ∆  from the variable  x .

As one can see from the figure for any value  x  the positions of the second and

third levels are in over-barrier region of energies. It should be noted, that according to the

right side of   figure 1,  there  are  two potential  wells for  which the  distance between the

levels is equal to the value of potential of rectangular barriers and there is one potential

well  for  which  distance  between  the  levels  is  equal  to  the  value  of  energy  of  the  first

level.

In figures 2 for the second type of solution we plot the dependencies of quantities
 and  ∆  from the variable  x . As seen from the figure for at any value of  x  the

first and second levels always are in under barrier region of energies.

Taking the above-mentioned results as a base, we have calculated the product of

normalized  dipole  matrix  elements  of  transitions

- the width infinite deep well with energy of the first

level equals to photon energy) depending on dimensionless parameter  x .

As seen from the figure 3а, the coefficient of generation gets its maximum value
at x = 0.5685. According to the result of paper [13]  χ is a maximum at x = 0.5677, that

means, that the result obtained here coincides with result of paper [13]. As is visible from

the  figure  3в  for  the  second  type  of  solution  the  maximal  generation  takes  place  at  the

smallest  value  of  parameter  x .  Essentially  here  we  have  the  intensity  of  generation

corresponding to the second type of solution always remains smaller then the generation

corresponding to the first type for any  x . The last allows the problem to be completely

solved, being limited by the first type of solution only.

According  to  the  above-mentioned,  independent  from  the  photon  frequency  the
SHG  becomes  the  maximum  when  dimensionless  parameters  x ,  ∆ ,  u   take  the  certain

values, namely

are defined as follows:

As seen from Eq.(10) the increase of photon energy leads to the decrease of  the

barrier  and  well  widths  while  the  height  of  the  barrier  increases.  At  electron  energy

.  As  we  shall  see  below,  the  account  of  finiteness  of  the

well brings to the significant corrections in the values of the well parameters.

2.  Generation in the finite depth well

Above  we  have  considered  the  problem  of  finding  the  maximum  of  SHG  for

infinite deep well containing inside a rectangular barrier, without taking into account the

changes of effective mass. We have actually repeated calculations of work [14] by using

the method suggested in the paper [15] for demonstration of its accuracy and efficiency.

 In  the  given  section  we  will  consider  the  same  problem,  but  for  a  finite  depth

well  taking  into  account  the  changes  of  electron  effective  mass  in  difference  layers  of

heterostructure. Dependencies of an electron potential energy and its effective mass from

the coordinate have the form:

As  can  be  seem  from  Eq.(11)  the  considered  potential  has  four  independent

parameters  V ,U , d , L   in  contrast  to  the  potential  (3)  which  had  three  independent

parameters. This essentially makes the solution more difficult compared with the solution

considered  in  the  Sec.2.  In  particular,  here  for  the  each  value  of  photon  energy  the

optimization of SHG should be done separately. For potential (11) the energy spectrum is

  which  corresponds  to  well  depth  about

.

 It is important to note that as in the case of infinite deep well the finite depth well

has two types of solutions also. The first is that when one level is in underbarrier region

only and the second one is that when in underbarrier region there are two levels. Due to

that for infinite deep well the SHG coefficient corresponding to second type of solution is

always less  than  the SHG  coefficient corresponding to the  first  type  (see  above)  at  any

values of  problem  parameters,  for  the  potential  (11)  we  are  limited  by  consideration  of

the first type of solution only.

 It is visible from (12) - (14), that for the given depth of the quantum well and the

photon energy (the difference of levels energies:

the dependencies of

changes.  In  figures  4e  and  4f  similar  dependencies  are  shown  but  without  taking  into

account  effective  changes  (

m

).  It  is  visible  that  the  levels  can  only  be

.0=

equidistant for values of  d more than  nm4

. The graphs show the increase of  d  leads to

the  increase 

1E ,  U   while  dependence  well  of  width  L   from  d is  non-monotonic

function. It is important to note that at any value of  d  taking into account the effective

mass changes reduces the well width smaller to then the well width determined without

the taking into account effective mass changes.

 . As it is seen

from figures 4с and 4g the increase of  d  decreases the transition probability between the

first and second, and the second and third levels, while the electron transition probability

from  the  third  level  to  the  first  one  increases.  It  should  be  mentioned  that  taking  into

account effective mass changes results in an increase of value of the SHG coefficient, in

comparison with the case when the effective mass was taken constant. The maximum of

 and 

. In the papers [14, 18] for experimental observation of SHG

for  wavelength 

the  heterostructure  had  been  chosen  with  parameters

  and 

d

5.4≈

  which  were  calculated  taking  into  account  the  effect

effective  mass  changes.  Our  calculations  show  that  these  values  of  parameters  do  not

provide  the  equidistance  of

  and 

E −

  (see  figure  4f),  and  maximality  the

SHG  coefficient  also  (see  figure  4h).  So,  in  particular,  at 

d

5.4≈

nm

  the  required

equidistance takes place at 

L

86.10≈

nm

. If for experiment one use the heterosystem with

values of parameters suggested in the present work the SHG well increases twice.

In figure 6 we present the table in which the maximum of the SHG coefficient and

the potential parameters are given for different values of radiation wavelengths. As it can

be seen the increase of radiation frequency decreases the coefficient maximum value.

CONCLUSION

In  this  paper  the  problem  of  determination  of  the  maximum  of  SHG  for  the

potential  well  containing  inside  a  rectangular  barrier  is  considered.  Consideration  was

carried out both for the case of infinite deep well and for the case of finite depth well. It is

shown that the problem of determination of ensemble of structures with equidistant first

three levels has two types of solutions. For the first type the second and third levels are

located in underbarrier region and for the second type of solutions above the barrier the

third level is located  only.  It  is also shown  that  generation  corresponding to  the second

type of solution always is less than generation for the second type.

The problem of finding the maximum of SHG coefficient for the finite depth well

both with and without taking into account the effective mass changes is solved precisely.

It is shown that  the  structural and  composite parameters  of  the  structural  chosen earlier

for experimental observation of the SHG can be essentially updated [18].

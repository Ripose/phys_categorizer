Abstract.  We  show  that  invariance  of  the  electric  charge  and  relativistic  kinematics  lead  to 
the transformation equations for electric field intensity and the magnetic induction. 
 
1. Introduction 
Teaching relativistic electrodynamics, the instructor starts with the statement that the electric 
charge  of  a  particle  is  a  relativistic  invariant,  i.e.  it  has  the  same  magnitude  for  all  inertial 
observers relative to whom it moves with different velocities. The neutrality of an atom inside 
which  the  positively  charged  nucleus  and  the  negatively  charged  electrons  move  with  very 
different relative velocities supports the statement. 
The approach requires the students to already posses understanding of the elementary notions 
in relativity (kinematics and dynamics) and classical electrodynamics, specifically: 
-  An  electric  field  of  intensity  E  acts  on  a  particle  carrying  an  electric  charge  q  with  an 
electric force 
E
q=F
which is velocity independent; 
-An  electric  charge  q  moving  with  velocity  u  in  a  magnetic  field  of  magnetic  induction  B 
detects the action of a magnetic force 
F
m
u representing the velocity of the charged particle relative to the rest frame of the observers 
who measure B. 
The  purpose  of  our  paper  is  to  derive  transformation  equations  for  the  physical  quantities 
introduced in order to characterize effects generated by stationary (electrostatics) or moving 
(electrodynamics)  charged  particles,  mainly  based  on  the  composition  law  of  relativistic 
velocities which can be derived using1 or avoiding2 the Lorentz-Einstein transformations for 
the space-time coordinates of the same event. 
2. Transformation equations for the components of E and B 
The  transformation  equations  for  the  field  quantities  E  and  B  are  a  starting  point  for 
relativistic  electrodynamics.  Rosser3  presents  two  derivations  of  them.  The  first  one  starts 
with  the  covariance  of  Maxwell’s  equations,  involves  the  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations 
for the space-time coordinates of the same event, which lead to the transformation equations 
for the partial derivatives with respect to the space and the time coordinates. The second one 
takes  into  account  the  transformation  equations  for  the  components  of  the  force  and  the 
transformation equations for relativistic velocities as well.                                                                                           
The involved inertial reference frames are K(XOY) and K'(X'O'Y'). Their corresponding axes 
are  parallel  to  each  other  and  the  OX(O'X')  axes  are  overlapped.  K'  moves  with  velocity  V 
relative to K in the positive direction of the overlapped axes. At the origin of time in the two 
frames (t=t'=0) the origins O and O' of the two frames are shortly located at the same point in 
space. We also consider a third inertial reference frame K0(X0,O0,Y0) that moves with velocity 
ux relative to K but with velocity 
The scenario we follow involves a very large conducting surface at rest in K0 reference frame 
and  confined  in  the  X0O0Y0  plane.  It  carries  a  charge  σ0  per  unit  area.  The  symmetry  of  the 
problem  indicates  that  the  lines  of  force  are  perpendicular  to  the  plane,  and  if  the  charge  is 

,                                                                                                  (2)

We have taken into account the fact that the true laws of physics are the same in all inertial 
reference frames, that distances measured perpendicular to the direction of relative motion are 
relativistic invariants, the Lorentz contraction of lengths measured in the direction of relative 
motion and the invariance of the vacuum permittivity ε0. We are interested in a relationship 
, the electric intensities of the same electric field measured by observers 
between Ey and 
from K and K' respectively. We obtain it combining Eqs. (4) and (5), and the result is

Eq.(6)  becomes  a  genuine  transformation  equation  if  we  express  its  right  hand  side  as  a 
function  of  physical  quantities  measured  by  observers  of  the  K'  frame.  Because  the

The motion of the charged plane does not generate a magnetic field. 
For deriving the transformation equations for the OX(O'X') components of the magnetic field, 
we consider a solenoid composed of several coaxial loops, all carrying the same current. Its 
axis coincides with the overlapped axes OX(O'X'). All the loops carry the same current. In its

As compared with other derivations of the transformations for E and B, we can consider that 
our  derivation  is  a  two  lines  one.  The  main  relativistic  ingredient  we  used  is  the 
transformation  of  relativistic  velocities.  The  strategy  we  have  followed  deriving  the 
transformations  for  E  and  B  leads  to  the  transformation  equations  for  charge  and  current 
densities.--

we  present  a  derivation  for  the  components  of  E  and  B    based  on    the  transformation  of 
relativistic velocities. 
Consider a particle that carries a positive charge q. It enters with velocity ux in a space where 
the observers of the K frame detect an electric field intensity Ey and a magnetic induction Bz. 
If the condition 
qE
is fulfilled, the particle continues to move along the OX axis. The principle of relativity tells 
us that (24) reads in K'

Comparing  (34)  and  (36)  we  see  that  the  OY(O'Y')  components  of  E  transform  as  the 
frequency  in  an  acoustic  wave  does.  Comparing  (35)  and  (37)  we  see  that  the  OZ(O'Z') 
components of B transform as the wave vector in an acoustic wave does.

4. Conclusions 
The traditional way to derive the transformation equations for the components of E and B use 
the Lorentz-Einstein transformations for the space-time coordinates and the transformation of 
force  as  well.  Our  derivation  uses  only  the  relativistic  velocity  transformation  and  the 
invariance  of  the  electric  charge.    The  usual  transformation  equations  present  the  Ey 
zB  as well. Our derivation presents Ey as a function of 
component as a function of 
  and  of  a  transformation  factor  that  depends  on  V  and  on  u   (15).  We  find  the  same 

yE
situation in the case of the transformation of the component of B.  
Our derivation shows clearly that a magnetic field is no more then a moving electric field and 
does not make use of Maxwell’s equations.

Abstract. The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) project will extract 120 GeV protons from 
the FNAL Main Injector in 8.56 µsec spills of 4×1013 protons every 1.9 sec.  We have designed 
secondary emission monitor (SEM) detectors to measure beam profile and halo along the proton 
beam  transport  line.    The  SEM’s  are  Ti  foils  5µm  in  thickness  segmented  in  either  1 mm  or 
0.5 mm  pitch  strips,  resulting  in  beam  loss  ~5×10-6.    We  discuss  aspects  of  the  mechanical 
design, calculations of expected beam heating, and results of a beam test at the 8 GeV transport 
line to MiniBoone at FNAL.  

INTRODUCTION 

The NuMI beamline [1,2] at Fermilab will deliver an intense muon neutrino beam 
to  the  MINOS  detectors  at  FNAL  and  at  the  Soudan  Laboratory  in  Minnesota.    The 
primary beam is fast-extracted onto the NuMI pion production target in 8.56µsec spills 
from the 120 GeV FNAL Main Injector.  The beam line is designed to accept 4×1013 
protons/spill.  Along most of the transport line, the spot size is 1-2 mm.  Because of 
the large 400kW average beam power, beam loss must be kept to of <10-5 in order to 
keep  residual  activation  of  beam  components  to  a  manageable  level  and  in  order  to 
prevent activation of water from aquifers near the underground NuMI tunnel. 

Instrumentation  along  the  700m  primary  beam  line  is  to  include  beam  profile 
monitors, capacitative beam position monitors (BPM’s), a resistive wall monitor, and 
two  beam  current  toroids  (BCT’s).    Additionally,  the  NuMI  target  is  electrically 
isolated,  so  may  be  read  out  as  a  Budal-type  monitor  [3],  and  an  ion  chamber  array 
near the beam dump measures the remnant primary beam after a long 725m free drift, 
so  acts  as  an  accurate  measure  of  the  final  proton  beam  angle  [4].    The  intercepting 
profile monitor SEM’s serve as the initial calibration of the BPM’s and ion chamber. 

Some  of  the  requirements  of  the  profile  monitor  SEM’s  are  as  follows:    (1)    the 
device  must  survive  ~1020  particles/cm2  per  year;    (2)  groundwater  activation  in  the 
carrier  tunnel  region  requires  beam  loss  ~10-6;  (3)    the  beam  centroid  position 
accuracy  must  be  ~100µm  along  the  transport  line  and  ~50µm  for  the  pre-target 
SEM’s;    (4)  the  SEM  chamber  vacuum  must  be  10-8  Torr;    (5)    the  measurement 
aperture must be ~2” and clear aperture 4”;  (6)  the device must be removable from 
the beam without turning off the beam, and replacing the device in the beam must be 
achieved to 50µm positional accuracy.

2.2cm radius.  A wide strip measures beam halo out to 3.8cm radius.  Accordion springs pressed into 
the  signal  and  HV  foils  maintain  tension  against  beam  heating.    The  strips  are  0.75 mm  wide  at  the 
ends,  where  accordion  springs  are  pressed  in  to  maintain  strip  tension.    In  the  area  traversed  by  the 
beam, the strips are 0.15 mm wide.  

 

PROFILE MONITOR SEM DESIGN 

We  have  borrowed  from  a  foil  SEM  at  CERN  [5]  and  designed  a  large-aperture 
SEM  constructed  from  5µm  Ti  foils.    Titanium  is  selected  because  it  appears  to 
maintain its secondary electron yield even after large particle fluences [6].  This is in 
contrast  to  the  standard  “multiwire”  SEM’s  in  use  at  FNAL  which  utilize  Au-plated 
W-Rh wires, which were observed to degrade in signal yield by more than 20% over 
the course of fixed target operations to KTeV [7].   

A view of the foil SEM paddle is shown in Figure 1.  Three planes of solid Ti foil, 
2.5µm in thickness, are interleaved with segmented foils intended for X and Y profiles.  
The signal foils are 5µm thick.  In this figure, the strip pitch is 1 mm.  Over the 8cm 
diameter area of the SEM traversed by the beam, the signal foil strips are 0.15 mm in 
width.  A total of 44 strips are etched into the foil, along with 1.5cm wide strips to to 
measure beam halo out to 3.8cm radius.  The paddle completely surrounds the beam, 
so  the  foils  may  be  inserted  into  the  beam  or  retracted  without  the  paddle  frame 
traversing the beam.  The foils are mounted on precise ceramic  combs which define 
the  strip  pitch  and  the  foil  location  on  the  paddle  [8].    A  “beam  hole”  of  12 mm 
diameter in the bias foil permits most of the 1 mm beam spot to pass through without 
beam loss, while still permitting adequate voltage bias to maintain signal yield. 
 

 

 

FIGURE 2.  Schematic drawing of the foil SEM vacuum can and actuator assembly.  The beam ports 
are  10cm  diameter  quick-disconnect  flanges.    The  actuator  and  foil  paddle  are  mounted  on  a  25cm 
diameter flange.  The actuator consists of a stepper motor and linear stage driving a vacuum bellows to 
which is rigidly connected a 5cm hollow shaft.  The foil paddle is cantilevered off the shaft. 

 
Each  signal  strip  has  32  accordion  springs  pressed  into  its  ends.    The  springs  are 
elongated  by  approximately  4 mm  prior  to  installation  on  the  paddle.    At  this 
extension, our measurements indicate a tension of ~1g is attained on each strip.  The 
mechanical  sag  δy  of  a  strip  of  cross-sectional  area  A,  length  L,  density  ρ,  may  be 
approximated  as  δy  =  gρAL2/T.    This  expression  gives,  for  L=12 cm,  a  tension 
T=1.0 g,  the  density  of  Titanium  ρ=4.5 g/cm3,  and  a  5 µm × 0.15 mm  strip,  a  sag 
δy=40 µm. Digital photographs of the mounted signal foils confirm a pitch of 1.0 mm, 
with strip-to-strip variation <15µm (the resolution of the photographs is 15 µm). 

The  foil  actuating  mechanism  and  vacuum  can  are  shown  in  Figure  2.    The  foil 
paddle  is  cantilevered  on  a  5cm  diameter  hollow  shaft,  the  other  end  of  which  is 
welded to a 12cm “conflat” flange.  A linear motion stage and stepper motor actuate 
the  assembly  into  or  out  of  the  beam.    A  9cm  outer  diameter,  6.4cm  inner  diameter 
bellows forms the vacuum seal for the actuator.  Ceramic-insulated limit switches [9] 
halt the stepper travel at either end, while a 1.25 mm range linear variable differential 
transformer  (LVDT)  confirms  the  final  beam  “in”  position  of  the  foils  with  1µm 
accuracy [10].  Kapton-insulated signal cables are routed through the hollow shaft to 
feedthroughs  at  its  end.    The  cables  are  bonded  to  the  foil  strips  using  a  conducting 
epoxy appropriate for ultra-high vacuum [11], which is also how the strips are bonded 
to the ceramics.  Brackets mount the linear stage to the large 25cm diameter conflate 
flange  on the end of the SEM’s vacuum chamber.  Precise dowel holes in the 25cm 
flange and in the moving flange at the end of the bellows allow in situ optical survey 
of the foil position when installed in the beam line.  The 16 liter vacuum chamber is 
20cm  diameter  cylinder  with  10cm  diameter  quick-disconnect  flanges  at  the  beam 
ports.   

 

 
FIGURE  3.    Vacuum  tests  of  completed  a  SEM.    Both  measurements  were  performed  on  a  vacuum 
system pumped on by a 30 liter/sec ion pump, with a gate valve which could isolate or include the SEM 
chamber.  (left) Pump-down curves.  (right)  Residual gas analysis.  

 
Tests have been performed of the linear motion actuator’s repeatability.  These tests 
include  tests  under  vacuum  load  and  in  air.    We  find  the  repeatability  is  better  than 
15 µm  over  24-48 hour  periods,  consistent  with  temperature  variations  in  the 
laboratory and the differential thermal expansion of the materials in the actuator.   

Vacuum tests were performed on a system which could isolate or include the SEM 
chamber via a UHV gate valve between the SEM and the rest of the system.  When the 
SEM  was  isolated,  a  rate-of-rise  measurement  indicates  an  outgas  rate  of  1.2×10-
7 Torr-liter/sec.  This outgas rate, furthermore, is consistent with the ultimate pressure 
achieved with the SEM included in the vacuum system (see Figure 3). 

THERMAL SIMULATIONS 

We have performed detailed finite element calculations of the temperature induced 
in the foil SEM’s due to heating by the NuMI beam [12].  The heat input to the SEM 
comes from the energy lost by the beam, and the power dissipated by the SEM comes 
from  blackbody  radiation  and  from  thermal  conduction  through  the  SEM  material.   
We performed the calculations for several materials using thermal conductivity, heat 
capacity, and density values from Ref. [13].  We also compared the heating of wires 
and foils; wire SEM’s cool less efficiently because blackbody radiation is proportional 
to the surface area of the emitter. 

The temperature rise in the SEM material results from ionization energy loss by the 
120 GeV protons.  We use the “restricted energy loss”, which accounts for ionization 
leading to electrons less than a cutoff energy Tcut:  dE/dx(Te<Tcut) [14].  For the cutoff 
energy Tcut, we use the energy at which the range of an electron is ½ the thickness of 
the SEM material.  The range values are taken from Ref [15].  This restricted dE/dx 
accounts properly for the fact that some δ rays escape out the back of the SEM, so do 
not deposit their energy in the SEM.  The restricted dE/dx values are given in Table 1.  
The  effect  of  restricted  energy  loss  is  greater  for  thin  foils  than  for  wire  SEM’s  and 
tends to lower the predicted energy deposited in the SEM, so this effect tends to again 
yield larger temperature predictions for a wire SEM as compared to a foil SEM.

Figure 4 shows the results of the thermal model for a Ti foil 5 µm in thickness.  The 
left  plot  of  Figure  4  shows  the  temperature  profile  along  the  center-most  strip  at 
several  times  during  the  1.9sec  beam  cycle,  after  many  transpired  beam  cycles.    As 
seen in the graph, the beam causes a sharp rise in temperature at t=0 sec.  The cooling 
between  spills  is  predominantly  due  to  blackbody  radiation.    The  (small)  effect  of 
thermal conduction is evident by the broadening temperature profile over the course of 
the cooling cycle.  The right graph of Figure 4 shows the linear expansion of the foil 
strip, and compares to the elongation expected for a Ti wire 50 µm in diameter.

Table 1 provides the temperature rise ∆T, maximum linear elongation ∆L, as well 
as dynamic stress S=αE∆T,  where α is the coefficient  of linear  expansion and E the 
Young’s Modulus.  The dynamic stress may be compared to the “yield stress” for the 
material, the point at which the material may deform plastically.  Beryllium, Carbon 
fiber  and  Titanium  are  preferable  from  the  point  of  view  of  long  term  material 
damage, ie: have dynamic stress values below the yield stress.

the  center  most  strip  at  several  time  increments  through  one  beam  cycle:    at  t=0sec  the  beam  passes 
through the foil, and at t=1.8 sec the foil has cooled to its minimum temperature, just prior to the next 
spill.  (right) Net elongation of a 12cm long, 5µm thick, Ti foil strip as a function of time, showing the

FIGURE 5.  Fraction of SEM charge collected vs the bias voltage.  The vertical scale is normalized to 
1.0 for the data point at 100V and 4×1011/spill.  The study is repeated for 5 beam intensities. 

 
The Ti foil SEM experiences 12µm elongation.  Because of the 4 mm extension in 
the  accordion  springs,  we  note  that  this  elongation  results  in  <1%  tension  loss.    Of 
note as well is the fact that a W-wire SEM, when strung on a frame at the maximum 
stress (the yield stress), stretches the wires by 160µm;  thus, beam heating will drop 
the  tension  of  such  a  wire  SEM  by  nearly  ⅓.    Such  loss  motivates  the  accordion 
springs  for  the  foil  SEM  or  individual  springs  on  wire  SEM’s  as  has  been  used  by 
previous workers [16].   

BEAM TEST RESULTS 

A prototype foil SEM detector was tested in the 8 GeV transfer line from the FNAL 
Booster  to  the  MiniBoone  experiment.    The  8 GeV  beam  has  σbeam≈3 mm  at  the 
location  of the  SEM, and the spill  is  1.56 µsec in duration.  The beam intensity was 
varied from 4×1011/spill to 4×1012/spill.  A BPM was available within 3m of the SEM 
and the beam intensity was measured at Booster extraction with a BCT.  

The first test was to measure the signal yield off the SEM as a function of voltage 
on the bias foils.  The results are shown in Figure 5 for several spill intensities.  The 
vertical axis in Figure 5 is the fractional charge collected, normalized to be 1.0 for the 
data point at 100Volts and 4×1011/spill intensity.  The data suggest a need for larger 
applied voltage as the beam intensity increases.   

The  second  purpose  of  this  test  was  to  study  the  SEM  resolution  for  determining 
the  beam  centroid.    This  was  accomplished  by  combining  two  studies,  one  in  which 
beam was at a stable position, and one in which it wandered over the SEM.

BPM centroid measurement for the same range of spills as the middle plot for the SEM. 

 
The results of the first resolution study are shown in Figure 6.  The beam appears to 
be stable for spills 16000-18000.   A histogram of the SEM and BPM centroids over 
this spill range are shown in the middle and right graphs of Figure 6, showing RMS 
values of 90 µm and 125µm, respectively.  These magnitudes are a combination of the 
detector resolutions as well as the extent to which the beam wanders.  We have:

The factor α=1.13 is a scale factor between the SEM and BPM, and reflects that the 
calibration of the two detectors may be imperfect;  ie: one millimeter in the SEM may 
be more than a millimeter as read out by the BPM.  The value of α is obtained below. 
To factor out the effect of beam wandering, we take the difference of these results:

In  the  second  resolution  study,  we  correlated  the  fitted  SEM  centroid  with  the

spills histogramed over a several hour period.  During this period, the beam wandered 
by ~2 mm, as is seen in both detectors.  These plots likewise suggest σSEM<σBPM. 

The  lower  left  plot  of  Figure  7  shows  the  correlation  of  the  BPM  and  SEM

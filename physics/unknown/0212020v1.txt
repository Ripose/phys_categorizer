The physical meaning of synchronization and simultaneity in
Special Relativity

Departamento de Física do IST, Universidade Técnica de Lisboa

     Rodrigo de Abreu

Based  on  two  previous  papers,  the  physical  meaning  of  synchronization  and
simultaneity  as  is  presented  in  Einstein's  Special  Relativity  paper  of  1905  is
reconsidered.  We  follow  Einstein's  argumentation  to  introduce  a  criterium  of
synchronization  and  for  the  same  arguments  we  arrive  at  a  different  criterium  for
synchronization. From that we conclude that simultaneity is absolute.

Abstract

Introduction

On  two  previous  papers  [1,  2]  we  have  analyzed  the  concepts  of  synchronization  and
simultaneity.  We  have  shown  in  those  two  papers  that  Einstein's  criterium  of
synchronization  only  in  one  system  holds.  We  call  that  system  the  rest  system.  If  we
introduce a time t' at a x' through x'=ct'  [2] for a system S' moving in relation to the rest
system we obtain Lorentz Transformation with desynchronized clocks. But if we assign
another t' with a similar relation where c is substituted by the one-way velocity of light
we obtain a Synchronized Transformation where the clocks at S' are synchronized. We
can pass from the Synchronized Transformation to the Lorentz Transformation through
a Transformation of t', trough  a  desynchronization.  We  have  also  shown    how  can  we
conceive  a  method  to  determine  by  experiment  the  absolute  velocity,  the  velocity  in
relation to the rest system [3].
Now we are going to follow some of the physical arguments presented by Einstein [4]
and we arrive to the same conclusions of the referred papers [1, 2]. Therefore we clarify
the physical meaning of synchronization and simultaneity.

1. On simultaneity and synchronization.

Einstein affirms  that  for  a  "rest  system"  the  velocity  of  light  is  c.  If  we  know  for that
system  the  velocity  of  light  we  can  synchronize  the  clocks  at  a  given  position  by
sending light between the several pairs of clocks that we can consider. If we know the
position of two clocks we can calculate the time required for light to travel from a clock
located  at  a  position  A  to  a  clock  located  to  a  position  B.  The  time  for  light  to  travel
from clock at position B to the clock at position A is the same since we admit that the
velocity  of  light  is  c  in  that  frame.  Therefore  we  can  establish  a  "common  time"  for
clocks A and B by putting clock B marking a time tB when the ray of light emitted at A
at a time tA, arrives at B.

This  is what Einstein  introduced  as  a  criterium  of  synchronization,  obvious  in  the  rest
system, the system where we assume that the velocity of light is c.

For  another  system  moving  in  relation  to  the  rest  system  the  same  criterium  with  the
same physical  meaning can  be applied  if we know the velocity of  light in that system.
Einstein continues the analysis of  the meaning of simultaneity and synchronization [4]
[Einstein, A. p. 127] considering, based on experience, the quantity

as a universal constant (the velocity of  light  in empty space). The two-way  velocity of
light (5) is equal to the one-way velocity of light in the rest system. Of course (5) holds
for the rest system since for the rest system the one-way velocity of light is also c. We
also assume as Einstein the validity of (5) for every frame moving in relation to the rest
system but we are not assuming that the one-way velocity of light in that system is also
c. We cannot assume that [1, 2].

In short we accept two principles:

I. 
II. 

For every system the two-way velocity of light (5) is c.
For one system, the velocity of  light one-way  is c. We call that system the rest
system.

At reference [2] we had concluded from these two principles that a coordinate x' at t=0
has at the rest system the value x0 with

where v is the velocity  of system S' in relation to the rest system.
Therefore the x' axes is contracted in relation to the rest system x axes.

We  also  concluded  from  I  and  II  that  the  time  t'  elapsed  for  the  clock  situated  at  the
origin of  S' (x'=0) is  related to the time t elapsed for the clocks at the rest system by:

Acknowledging  those  results,  let  us  follow  Einstein  analysis  of  simultaneity  [4]
[Einstein, A. p. 129]:

Consider a rod with length rAB as measured in the rest system with velocity v in relation
to the rest system. A and B are the two ends of the rod "equipped with  clocks  that  are
synchronous with the clocks of the rest system,  i.e. whose readings always correspond
to the "time of the system at rest" at the locations the clocks happen to occupy; hence,
the clocks are "synchronous in the rest system". We further imagine that each clock has
an  observer  co-moving  with  it,  and  that  these  observers  apply  to  the  two  clocks  the
criterium  for  the  synchronous  rate  of  two  clocks  formulated  in  section  1."  [4].  But  in
section 1 the referred criterium was formulated for the clocks at the rest system and can
not be extended for others systems. I and II implies that the one-way velocity of light in
a system S' moving in relation to the rest system is not c, as we have demonstrated [1,
2]. Therefore, the referred criterium can not be used for the system of the rod.

Acknowledging that, let's continue with Einstein analysis [4] [Einstein, A. p.129]:

Let a ray of light start out of A at time tA and reflected from B at time tB arriving at A at
time  t'A.  If  we  consider  the  rest  system,  since  the  velocity  of  light  in  that  system  is  c
from postulate I, we have

And Einstein concludes:

-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
"Observers  co-moving  with  the  rod  would  thus  find  that  the  two  clocks  do  not  run
synchronously, while observers in the system at rest would declare them to be running
synchronously"  and  therefore  "we  cannot  ascribe  absolute  meaning  to  the  concept  of
simultaneity".  (If  the  clocks  are  marking  the  same  time  of  the  the  rest  system  clocks
how  can  they  not  be  synchronized  ?  How  can  we  be  certain  that  the  criterium  can  be
applied to the system moving with the rod ? How can we be certain that the velocity of
light is also c in that system).

From  postulate  I  and  II  we  cannot  achieve  that  conclusion  [1,  2].  From  I  and  II  the
conclusion is the following:

The clocks  moving with the rod have rhythms slower compared with the  clocks  at the
rests system, eq. (6a). If we admit that the clocks at the ends of the rod are synchronized
at an instant with the clocks of the rest system, since those clocks have a slower rhythm,
for another instant those clocks are desynchronized with the  clocks  of  the  rest  system.
But  this  conclusion  does  not  implies  that  the  clocks  at  the  ends  of  the  rod  are
desynchronized  between  each  other.  Indeed  if  the  clocks  at  the  ends  of  the  rod  at  an
instant are synchronized with the clocks at the rest system they pass  for every clock at
the  rest  system  marking  both  the  same  "time"  although  different  of  the  "time"  of  the
clocks of the rest system. The same rhythm, the same velocity, implies that. Therefore,
if we have two events that are simultaneous for the rest system we conclude that are also
for  a  system  moving  in  relation  to  that  system.  The  generalization  for  any  other  two
systems is obvious.

2. Theory of Transformations of Coordinate and Time.

Einstein [4] [Einstein, A. p. 132] affirms that a ray of light emitted in time tA at a point
A of S' moving with velocity v in relation to the rest system S and reflected at a point B
toward the point A  arrives there at time t'A with

This  condition  (11)  is  the  same  condition  (4)  for  the  rest  system.  But  for  a  system  S'
moving  with  velocity  v  to the  rest  system  the  condition  for the  synchronization  of  the
clocks is other. We cannot use the velocity of light as c for the system S'.

We can synchronize the clocks at S' if we  know  the  velocity  of  light  from  A  to  B and
from  B  to  A.  We  can  obtain  the  physical  synchronization  of  that  clocks,  with  the
physical criterium introduced  by Einstein to obtain synchronization, but of course with
the velocity of light in that system

The  postulate  I  implies  that  for the  rest  system  eq.  (15)  is  verified.  But  for  S'  we  can

for  another  system.  Only  for one  system,  the  rest  system,  we  have  the  condition  (18).
The Einstein's method of synchronization with condition (18) only for one system holds.
However we can synchronize the clocks in all systems. Since we consider S as the rest
system  we  can  synchronize  the  clocks  at  S'  because  we  know  the  velocity  of  S'  in
relation to S and therefore we know the velocity of  light one-way,  (16) and (17). The
result of that synchronization  is obvious. All the clocks at S' mark time t', the  same  t'.
That time is related with the time for the rest system through eq. (6a). But we are going
to synchronize the clocks confirming the obvious result sending in the usual manner  a
ray of light between the two clocks. Suppose the clock at x'=0 at t'=0. From that point
and  instant  a  ray  of  light  is  emitted  and  absorbed  at  another  x'>0  at  an  instant  t'.  The
clocks are synchronized if

 This condition must be equivalent to the other condition that all the clocks are marking
the  same  instant  t'.  The  ray  of  light  emitted  at  x'=0  passes  by  a  clock  at  x  when  this
clock  marks  t=x/c  since  the  velocity  of  light  at  S  is  c.  The  ray  of  light  passes  by  a
corresponding clock at S' when this clock marks t' eq. (20). Indeed

where x0 is the the position of the second clock  in S at t=0 [2];

relation we send a ray of light from x'=0 to x' and reflected back to x'=0. From postulate

3. The Transformation with synchronized clocks (ST).

If  the  clocks  at  S'  are  synchronized  we  have  therefore  the  following  transformation

Of  course  we  can  made  another  mapping.  When  the  ray  of  light  emitted  at  x'=0,  t'=0
passes  by  a  clock  at  x'  we  can  put  the  clock  marking  t'=x'/c  and  we  obtain  Lorentz
Transformation  [1].  Since  the  velocity  of  light  at  S'  is  not  c  the  clocks  of  S'  with  this
mapping  are  no  synchronized.  One  of  the  arguments  usually  presented  to  affirm  that
Einstein  method  of  synchronization  holds  in  any  system  is  that  we  don't  know  what
system  is the rest system. Therefore  it is  often  said  that  any  system  can  be  considered
the rest system. But that affirmation does not mean that after admitting that  a system is
the rest system the others can also be considered as the rest system. If we choose, for the
analysis, that a system is the rest system the others are not. Only by an experiment can
we determine the rest system.

4.  Relation  between  a  Transformation  with  synchronized  clocks  (ST)  and
Lorentz Transformation (LT).

How can we pass  from ST eq. (30) and (31) to LT. From (30) and (31) we can obtain
LT if  X=x' and if we transform t' to T by

We have with eq.(36) and (38) LT. We obtain LT  introducing a dessynchronization of

5. A gedanken experiment to determine the absolute velocity.

Consider two  systems  S'  and  S''  with  velocities  v1  and  v2  in  relation  to  a  system  S  the
rest system [3]. Consider that v2 > v1.  We assume that the origins of the three reference
systems coincide when the clocks fixed at the origin of each system mark the same time
t=t’=t”=0. We can calculate the "time" elapsed in S for the origin of S'', x''=0, to arrive
at coordinate x'. That "time" t can be calculated by

This "time"  is the "time"  marked  by the  clock  at  x'  for the  ST.  We  can  pass  from  this

This step is needed, since the observer in S’ doesn’t know yet his absolute velocity and,
naturally,  has  “synchronized”  his  clocks,  namely  the  clock  at  x’  with  the  clock  at  the
origin of S', by the Einstein´s method.

We  can  also  measure  the  "time"  t''  elapsed  at  the  clock  located  at  x''=0.  That  time  is

From (43) and (44) we determine v1 and v2 .

In  synthesis:  for  two  systems  S’  and  S’’  in  relative  motion,  i)  begin  by  adjusting  the
clocks located at the origins of the reference systems for the same reading when the two
origins pass by each other; ii) mark a distance x´ at S’; iii) “synchronize” the clocks at S’
with  light  by  the  Einstein´s  method  (in  order that the  clock  at  x´  could  be  used  later);
iv) when the origin of S” passes by the mark x’ at S´, read the clock at the origin of S”
(time  t’’)  and  read  the  clock  at  x´  in  S’  (time  T);  v)  from  (43)  and  (44)  calculate  the
absolute velocities v1 and v2 of  S´and S´´, respectively, in relation to the rest system S.

Conclusion

We have shown in this paper that following the arguments used by Einstein at the article
of 1905 about Special Relativity we are conducted to the same conclusions achieved at
other two previous papers.  Only in one system, the rest system, the velocity of light can
be c, the two way velocity measured by experiment. The Lorentz Transformation is one
possible  transformation  that  we  can  obtain  relating  two  systems.  The  Lorentz
Transformation  results  from  a  particular  assignment  of  time  at  a  system  S'  moving  in
relation to the rest system S. Since that assignment is x'=ct' and the velocity of light in
S´ is not c, the clocks marking the time t' at different x' are not synchronized.  We also
obtain  a  Synchronized  Transformation  relating  the  same  two  systems.  For  that
Transformation  the  clocks  in  each  system  are  synchronized  between  each  other  for
different x' since the assignment of time is made by the one-way speed of light.  We also
have  shown  how  can  we  pass  from  one  Transformation  to  the  other  by  introducing
another clock at a x' marking  a  time  desynchronized  to the  clock  correspondent to the
Synchronized Transformation.

If we admit that we know the laws of physics in one system and if we wrote  those Laws
of physics  in a covariant form,  for example  with  differential  forms,  in  other  system  in
relative uniform  movement we have the same  laws, the same  forms.  We  are  assuming
that.  Therefore  the  covariance  of  physical  laws  does  not  depend  of  the  system  of
coordinates that we choose. The ST Transformation is one possible Transformation that
relates two systems in relative uniform movement. Therefore if we admit that we know
a physical law in one system we have the same  law  in  any other system  independently
of the use of ST or LT. The Lorentz Transformation reveals a symmetry that permits an

-
-
-
-
introduction of mathematical entities that have the same form for the components of that
entities but we must be aware of the physical meaning of that entities since the clocks of
the  Lorentz  Transformation  are  desynchronized.  For  example  the  velocity  of  two
systems  is  not  reciprocal  although  the  usual  entitie  "velocity"  defined  with  LT
coordinates is reciprocal.

 A  clarification  of  the  physical  meaning  of  synchronization  and  simultaneity  has  been
presented and we also have shown how can we conceive the experimental determination
of the absolute velocity.

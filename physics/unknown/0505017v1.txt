Abstract  Instabilities at interface of two stream granular flows have been reported in 

recent  experiment  [1]  that  breaking  waves  can  form  at  the  interface  between  two 

streams of identical grains flowing on an inclined plane downstream of a splitter plate. 

In this report, the theory of hydrodynamic instability is used to analyze the shear flow 

of  granular  materials.  It  is  shown  that  the  shear  instability  in  two-stream  granular 

flows actually comes from the competition between the energy gradients in transverse 

and streamwise directions as well as the interaction of two streams.  We argue that the 

flow  energy  loss  in  the  streamwise  direction  has  a  stabilizing  effect,  while  the 

transverse component of the friction force formed by grain surface friction acts as the 

source  of  instabilities.  An  equation  has  been  derived  to  characterize  the  transition 

between  steady  and  wavy  flows.  Good  qualitative  agreement  with  the  experimental

1. INTRODUCTION 

Granular  flows  have  displayed  a  variety  of  instabilities  under  various  flow  and 

geometric conditions which are responsible for the phenomena of mixing, segregation, 

jamming,  earthquakes  and  faulting  etc  [1-8].  Recently,  Goldfarb  et  al  [1]  reported  a 

study on wave instability in granular flows down on an inclined chute (Fig.1a). They

observed  experimentally  that  breaking  waves  can  form  at  the  interface  between  two 

streams of identical grains flowing on an inclined plane downstream of a splitter plate. 

Changes  in  either  the  shear  rate  or  the  angle  of  incline  cause  such  waves  to  appear 

abruptly.  The  instability  is  more  intensive  as  the  inclined  angle  of  the  plate  to  the 

horizontal  is  decreased.  They  suggested  that  the  wave  results  from  the  competition 

contention  between  shear  and  extensional  strains  in  the  flowing  granular  bed,  and 

proposed  a  dimensionless  shear  number  to  express  the  extent  for  transition  between 

steady  and  wavy  flows.  The  proposed  mechanism  and  the  criterion,  however,  could 

not  be  used  to  explain  certain  observed  phenomena.  For  example,  the  sheared  flow 

with  glass  beads  does  not  generate  the  supposedly  wave  instability,  while  the 

competition  between  shear  and  elongation  still  exists.  Flows  with  unsieved  sands 

generate more extensive waves than the sieved sands, and but the competition of the 

shear and elongation may act equally with the sieved sands and unsieved sands. These 

unanswered issues provided the motivation for this study. 

 

Dou  (2002)  [9]  proposed  an  energy  gradient  theory  with  the  aim  to  clarify  the 

mechanism of transition from laminar to turbulence. It is thought that the gradient of 

total energy in the transverse direction of the main flow and the viscous friction in the 

streamwise direction dominate the instability phenomena and hence the flow transition 

for given disturbance. The energy gradient in the transverse direction has the potential 

to  amplify  a  small  velocity  disturbance,  while  the  viscous  friction  loss  in  the 

streamwise  direction  can  resist  and  absorb  this  small  disturbance  energy.  The 

transition to turbulence depends on the relative magnitude of the two roles of energy 

gradient amplifying and viscous friction damping to the initial disturbance. Based on 

 

2

such,  a  new  dimensionless  parameter,  K  (the  ratio  of  the  energy  gradient  in  the 

transverse direction to that in the streamwise direction), can be written as,

 is the total energy for incompressible flows with ξ as the

coordinate  perpendicular  to  the  ground,  n  denotes  the  direction  normal  to  the 

streamwise direction and s denotes the streamwise direction. The parameter K in Eq.(1) 

is  a  field  variable.  The  occurrence  of  instability  depends  upon  the  magnitude  of  this 

dimensionless parameter K and the critical condition is determined by the maximum 

value of K in the flow,  maxK

. For a given flow geometry and fluid properties, when 

maxK

 in  the  flow  field  is  larger  than  a  critical  value,  it  is  expected  that  instability 

would occur for certain initial disturbance [9]. The analysis show that the transition to 

turbulence is due to the energy gradient and the disturbance amplification, rather than 

a linear eigenvalue instability type [10-12]. Dou (2002) demonstrated that the criterion 

has  obtained  excellent  agreement  with  the  experimental  data  for  parallel  flows.  The 

critical value of  maxK

 is about 370-380 for plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille 

flow  as  well  as  plane  Couette  flow.  Dou  also  suggested  that  this  theory  may  be 

extended to the other areas such as flow instability in granular flows.   

  

 

In this work, a simple and yet reasonably useful constitutive relation is proposed 

for slow flows of frictional granular materials under gravity. Then the energy gradient 

theory of hydrodynamic instability [9] is used to study and analyze sheared flows of 

granular  material,  and  an  equation  to  characterize  the  transition  between  steady  and 

wavy  flows  is  derived.  The  experiments  observed  phenomena  in  [1]  are  reasonably

where  t  is  the  time,  V  the  velocity  vector,  ρ  the  density  of  the  material,  p  the 

hydrodynamic  pressure,  T  the  stress  tensor,  and  F  is  the  gravity  force  with 

gravitational acceleration g.  

  Models of fluid mechanics like have been used in granular materials [13-21]. In 

some models, the stress among the particle of grains is considered to be composed of 

collision  and  friction  mechanisms  [2,14].  We  reckoned  that  these  two  roles  produce 

the  apparent  “viscosity”  of  the  flow  and  the  contact  stress.  The  stress  tensor  for  the 

flow of granular material is split into two parts, with analogy to Oldroyd-B model [22],

D  is the Newtonian stress tensor with µ as the dynamic viscosity 

of the fluid and D is the tensor of rate-of-strain, and 

2T  is the surface frictional stress 

tensor  of  grains.  We  consider  that µ is  the  apparent  viscosity  of  the  fluid  cell  and 

comes  primarily  from  the  collision  and  deformation  of  the  materials,  and 

2T comes 

mainly  from  the  surface  friction  among  particles.  For  frictionless  material  such  as 

smoothed glass balls, 

0=T

 and

Introducing above relations into Eq.(1), we obtain,

3.  FLOW INSTABILITY 

 

Next, we apply the theory of flow instability developed for turbulence transition 

[9]  to  the  granular  flows.  We  utilize  the  governing  equations  (7,  8)  for  the  energy 

gradient  to  calculate  the  value  of  K  in  the  flow  field.  According  to  [9],  the  position 

with  a  maximum  of  K  in  the  flow  should  be  the  most  “unstable”  location  if  the 

instability appears.

along the transversal direction. K attains its maximum value at the position where  a  is 

maximized.  It  should  be  mentioned  that  Eq.(11)  is  exact  for  inertialess  flows 

regardless of how the frictional stress tensor 

2T  is constructed.  

For two stream flows side by side shown as in Fig.1, we assume that the flow is

As shown in Fig.2a, a band with high value of K will be formed at the interface. 

  We made the following observations:  

(1) Interface instability: For two-stream sheared flows, when the velocity difference 

between the two streams is small and the inclined angle is large,  maxK

 is small. Thus, 

the  flow  is  stable  and  no  wavy  instability  appears.  When  the  velocity  difference 

between  the  two  streams  becomes  large  and  the  inclined  angle  is  reduced,  maxK

 

increases. When  maxK

 reaches beyond a critical value, the flow instability may appear 

at interface following Eq.(13). This instability occurrence displays a three-dimensional 

behavior  of  the  interaction,  i.e,  the behaviour  in  x-y  plane  at  interface  results  in  the 

wavy  instability  in  the  third  direction.  This  is  possibly  the  reason  why  the  wavy 

interface instability is formed with interfacial shear of two streams. This phenomenon 

is  different  from  the  Kelvin-Helmholtz  instability  in  free  shear  flows  of  Newtonian 

fluids.  In  Kelvin-Helmholtz  instability,  the  instability  is  due  to  the  formation  of 

inflexion profile and the high Reynolds number. The instability can be considered as 

that it is induced by increasing the kinetic energy gradient in transverse direction. The 

flow  can  be  only  two-dimensional,  and  there  is  formation  of  vortices  along  the 

interface. In experiment [1], only wavy instability and wave breaking appear, and no 

vortex is found. The reason is explained as below. Although there is shear between the 

two streams, the kinetic energy gradient in the direction normal to x-y plane is small 

 

7

owing to the low Reynolds number.  Therefore, vortices like in free shear flows could 

not be formed.   

 

The  effect  of  velocity  profile  on  stresses  has  been  studied  in  [23]  and  it  was 

shown  that  the  amplitude  of  avalanche  depends  on  the  velocity  profile.  Hartley  and 

Behringer [24] also demonstrated that there is a logarithmic velocity profile in shear 

flows of granular matters, rather than the stresses being independent of the shear rate 

as in some studies (see [24]). This is consistent with the assumption in our proposed 

model that the stress is related to the shear rate. 

 (2)  Effect  of  inclined  angle:  Equation  (13)  indicates  that 

maxK

 is  inversely 

proportional  to  αtan

.  When α is  reduced,  maxK

 increases.  Thus,  a  smaller α leads 

to  the  flow  being  more  unstable.  In  other  words,  making  the  inclined  angle  to  the 

horizontal leads to a more intense instability, in agreement with experiments shown on 

wavy  breaking  when  the  angle  is  reduced  [1].  We  also  noted  that  maxK

 in  Eq.(13) 

becomes singular when the inclined angle is reduced to zero. This should not happen 

because there is a critical value of α for a given material thickness below which the 

flow cannot be sustained [20, 25-26]. In [1], the critical value obtained is 19.6 degree.  

 

Fig.  3  shows  the  possible  comparison  of  theory  with  the  experiments  from  [1].  

When  the  surface  frictional  factor  of  grains  is  large,  the  effect  of  the  parameter  1a  

and 2a  on the value of K is small. In this case, the value of K mainly depends on the 

distribution  of  frictional  force  (

yx
ηλ )
,(

).  If  we  further  assume  that  the  value  of 

(

 is  not  strongly  dependent  on α ,  we  have 

K

)
∝ α

 roughly  from  Eq.(13).  This  relation  is  provided  in  Fig.  3,  together 

−

1

 

8

with the experimental data in [1].  Although it is not exactly that the wave amplitude is 

proportional to  maxK

, the trend is observed here.  

(3)  Smoothed  grains:  For  smoothed  grains, 

0=η  and 

K

max =

0

 in  Eq.(13). 

Therefore, the interface instability will never occur. Glass balls are nearly frictionless 

and η is  very  small  (thus  maxK

 small),  and  instability  should  not  occur  with  two-

stream glass ball flows.  

(4)  Unsieved  sand  versus  sieved  sand:  Unsieved  sand  contributes  to  the  non-

uniformity of grains, and leads to a large value of the apparent surface friction factor 

of  grains.  Thus,  this  will  result  in  an  increased  maxK

 according  to  Eq.(13).  The  two 

stream flows will be more unstable with unsieved sand.   

(5)  Roughness  of  the  bottom  wall:  Experiments  showed  that  the  bottom  wall 

roughness makes the flow more unstable [1]. Goldfarb et al [1] thought that it might be 

due to the reduced elongation of the flow. From the present theory, this phenomenon 

may be attributed to the following reasons. The roughness of the bottom wall results in 

disturbance to the flow and increases the friction of the media. Thus, the flow will be 

more unstable from Eq.(13).  

 

It  is  clear  that  the  reason  and  mechanism  for  the  interfacial  wavy  instability  of 

sheared flows can be broadly traced to the grain surface friction and the inclined angle 

as well as the velocity profile of the sheared flow. The grain surface friction generates 

normal stresses which lead to energy drop across the transversal direction. This energy 

gradient (drop) acts on the flow of materials transversely. These roles constructed the 

distribution of the parameter K in x-y plane for each stream. The interaction of two-

streams makes the value of K large at interface. When the value of  maxK

 is larger than 

 

9

some critical value for a given flow condition, wavy instability may occur. Owing to 

the transversal energy gradient is proportional to the frictional factor, the grains with 

larger  frictional  factor  will  produce  wavy  instability  easily.  The  discovery  of  the 

physics  of  shear  instability  will  help  the  understanding  of  the  flow  of  granular 

materials  and  to  improve  the  constitutive  relation  development.  These  results  have 

significant  interests  in  the  design  of  industrial  processing  and  the  prediction  of 

catastrophic events.

An equation for the constitutive model (

(

)

g ) in Eq.(3) 

and (4) of granular flows under gravity is proposed with an analogy to the Oldroyd-B 

model for the frictional granular materials. This model gives the equilibrium relation 

for both smoothed and frictional materials. The instabilities at interface of two-stream 

granular flows can be described using the energy gradient theory which was proposed 

for laminar-turbulence transition. An equation has been derived for characterizing the 

extent  of  instability  and  the  transition  between  steady  and  wavy  flows.  Good 

qualitative agreement with the experimental data is obtained. The argument of waves 

resulting  from  a  competition  between  shear  and  extensional  strains  in  the  flowing 

granular bed as presented in [1] may not have provided a full picture; we show that the 

shear  instability  in  granular  flows  comes  from  the  competition  between  the  energy 

gradients  in  the  two  directions  (x,y)  and  the  interaction  between  the  two  streams 

(leading  to  large  K  value  at  interface).  The  wavy  instability  appearance  displays  a 

three-dimensional  behaviour  of  the  interaction,  i.e.,  the  behaviour  in  x-y  plane  at 

interface results in the wavy instability in the third direction.

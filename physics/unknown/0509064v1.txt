Abstract 
 

The formal structure of quantum electrodynamics consists of various elements.  

These include the Schrödinger equation which evolves the system forward in time, the 

vacuum state which is assumed to be the state with a free field energy of zero, and the 

principle of gauge invariance.  In this paper we will examine the mathematical 

consistency of these elements.  It will be shown that these elements, which are basic to 

the formal structure of the theory, are not mathematically consistent.

1. Introduction 

In this paper we will examine the formal structure of quantum electrodynamics 

(QED).  We will consider a quantized fermion field which is acted on by an applied 

classical electromagnetic field.  QED is a mathematical theory in that it consists of 

various elements that are assumed to be mathematically consistent.  These elements 

include the following:  First, there is the Schrödinger equation which governs the 

dynamics of the theory, that is, it evolves the system forward in time.  Second, there is 

the vacuum state  0

.  The key feature of the vacuum state is that its free field energy is 

assumed to be zero and all other states have a free field energy greater than zero.  The 

free field energy is the expectation value of the free field Hamiltonian and will be 

formally defined later.  A third element of the theory is that it is assumed to be gauge 

invariant.  The question that will be addressed here is whether or not these elements are 

mathematically consistent.  It will be shown that they are not.  Throughout this discussion 

we assume 

=(cid:61)

c 1=

. 

In the Schrödinger representation of QED the field operators are time independent 

and the state vector 

 evolves in time according to the Schrödinger equation [1,2],

2. The vacuum state 

The state vector  0  is defined as the vacuum state and is the state in which no 

particles or anti-particles exist.  It is an eigenvector of the free field Hamiltonian operator 

ˆH

0

 with an eigenvalue of zero, 

ˆH 0
0

0=  

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy, 

and 

 

n m = δ

 

 

mn

A complete set of orthonormal eigenstates  n  can be produced by acting on the vacuum 

state  0  by creation operators which produce additional states.  The eigenstates  n  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(14) 

(15) 

(16) 

(17) 

(18) 

ˆH n
0

=

E n  where E

>

0 for  n

≠

0

 

 

n

n

Any arbitrary state  Ω  can be expresses as a Fourier sum of the eigenstates   n  

(including the vacuum state  0 ), e.g., 

Ω = ∑
j

c n
j

j

 and 

Ω = ∑
j

c n∗
j

j

 

 

where  c  are the expansion coefficients. Use (15) and (16) to show that, 

j

 

Ω

ˆH

0

Ω = ∑
j

2

c

j

jE  

7

 

  

 

 

 

 Due to the fact that all the

jE ≥ 0

 it is evident that for an arbitrary state 

Ω  the following 

relationship holds, 

Ω

ˆ
H

0

Ω ≥

ˆ
0 H 0
0

= 0    

 

 

 

 

 

(19) 

Therefore the free field energy of any arbitrary state is non-negative. 

3. Gauge invariance 

 

In Section 1 and 2 we have introduced some elements of the formal theory.  In 

this section we will add another element.  We will assume that the theory is gauge 

invariant. We will try to determine the effect, if any, that this assumption has on the 

elements of the theory introduced so far.  What we are looking for is mathematical 

consistency.  Is the assumption of gauge invariance mathematically consistent with the 

material presented in the last two sections? 

Gauge invariance is an important requirement that quantum theory must satisfy 

[3].  A change in the gauge is a change in the electric potential that leaves the electric and 

magnetic fields unchanged.  Such a transformation is given by, 

A

′→ − ∇χ

A

;  A

→ +′
A

0

0

 

 

 

 

 

(20) 

∂χ
t
∂

 

where  χ

( , tx )

 is an arbitrary real valued function. 

If a theory is gauge invariant then the observables of the theory are invariant 

under a gauge transformation.  This includes the current and charge expectation values 

and the quantity  ξ → .  Now consider the following problem.  Assume that at the 

t

( i
t

)

f

initial time

the electric potential is zero and the state vector is 

it

)itΩ
(

.  Next apply a 

non-zero electric potential for 

t

t>

, i.e., 

i

8

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(

(
A x

)
, t , A

0

(

x
, t

)

)

=

0 at t

=

t ;   
i

(

(
A x

)
, t , A

0

(

x
, t

)

)

≠

0 for t

>

t

i  

 

(21) 

Now, under the action of the electric potential, the state vector evolves from the initial 

state 

)itΩ
(

 into some final state 

)ftΩ
(

 at 

ft > it

.  Suppose that we have picked an 

initial state and electric potential so that in some region of space at the final time 

ft

 the 

time derivative of the charge expectation of the final state 

 is non-zero, that is, 

)ftΩ
(

∂ρ

e

x
, t

f

)

(
t
∂

f

≠

0 in some region

 

 

 

 

 

 

(22) 

How are we justified in assuming that this it is possible to achieve this condition?  

Well we assume that our theory models the real world.  And in the real world there are 

many situations where the time derivative of the charge density is non-zero.  A trivial 

example would be an electrically charged object moving with any non-zero velocity.   

Next consider a similar  problem but using, instead, the electric potential, 

(

A

′
, A

)0
′ =

A

− ∇χ

, A

+

0

 

 





∂χ
t
∂





 

where  χ

( , tx )

 is a real valued function that satisfies, 

χ

(

x

, t

)

=

0 for t

=

t

i

 and  

∂χ

, t
x

)

(
t
∂

t

=

t

i

=

0

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(23) 

(24) 

Note that at the initial time 

, the quantity 

it

(
χ x

), t

and its first derivative with respect to 

time is zero.  Therefore at the initial time the electric potential (

A

′
, A

)
′ =
0

(

A

, A

)

0

=

0

. 

Under the action of the electric potential of Eq. (23) the initial state vector 

)itΩ
(

 will evolve into the final state vector 

 where, in general, 

)ft′Ω
(

(
ft′Ω

)

(
≠ Ω ft

)

 because (

′A
, A′
0

)

 does not equal 

, AA

.  However we can use (20) 

(

)0

9

 

 

(25) 

(26) 

to show that 

(

′A
, A′
0

)

 is related to 

, AA

 by a gauge transformation.  We have 

(

)0

postulated that the theory must be gauge invariant.  Therefore the current and charge 

expectation values must be the same for both problems, i.e., 

J

the right of Eq. (30), are all independent of

χ x

.  That is, 

(
χ x

 can take on any 

value, subject to the initial conditions (24) without changing the values of the rest of the 

quantities on the right hand side of (30).  We will use this fact to show that we can always 

find a 

χ x )
( , t

 which makes 

′Ω

 a negative number.  This is a direct 

contradiction to the relationship given by  (19). 

 

Note that the equation 

0=

 is the continuity equation.  Since local charge 

(
x
L , t

)

conservation is an experimental fact it would be reasonable, at this point, to set 

(
x
L , t

)

∂  to zero.  However, we have not assumed local charge conservation, just 
t

gauge invariance,  therefore we shall consider two possible cases.  First, consider the case

What we have shown is that if we assume that the theory is gauge invariant then 

there must exist state vectors whose free field energy is negative with respect to the 

vacuum state.  This is in contradiction to (19).  Therefore if we assume that QED is gauge 

invariant we find that there is an inconsistency in the formal theory.  

4. Discussion 

Let us review the results so far.  We start with equations (1) and (2).  These 

equations govern the dynamics of the theory.  From these we then use the basic rules of 

12

 

 

 

 

 

algebra and calculus to derive (13).  Note that the current and charge operators are 

defined in terms of the field operators in Eq. (4), however this relationship is not used (it 

is introduced for informational purposes only).  Therefore Eq. (13) follows directly from 

(1) and (2).   

So far the theory is incomplete.  We have a dynamical equation that describes 

how a state vector evolves in time but we not have provided any information on the state 

vectors that the operators act on.  In Section 2 we make some comments on the state 

vectors.  The key relationship derived in that section is Eq. (19) which states that the free 

field energy of any arbitrary state vector must be non-negative. 

Note that the theory at this point is still incomplete.  To complete the formal 

theory we would have to define the field operators, in the usual manner,  in terms of 

raising and lowering operators and define the commutator relationships between these 

operators.  The state vectors are then defined in terms of creation operators acting on the 

vacuum state.  At this point we would be able to, in principle, solve actual problems. 

However, it is not the purpose of this paper to introduce the complete formal 

theory which is more then adequately covered in the physics literature.  The purpose of 

this paper is to examine some of the elements of the formal theory and determine if they 

are mathematically consistent. 

In Section 3 we show that these elements are not mathematically consistent.  Here 

we examine an initial state that is acted on by two different electric potentials that differ 

by a gauge transformation.  If we assume that the theory is gauge invariant then we can 

assume that the physical observables for both potentials are the same.  This allows us to 

13

 

 

derive (30) from (13).  From  (30) it is easy to show that there must exist state vectors 

Ω  such that 

ˆHΩ

0

Ω < 0  which violate the relationship given by (19). 

Note that (13) follows directly from the dynamical equations and (30) follows 

from (13) and the assumption of gauge invariance.  Therefore the fact that there must 

exist states where 

Ω

Ω <  follows from the dynamical equation and the 

0

ˆH

0

assumption of gauge invariance.  Therefore for a mathematically consistent theory the 

state vector must be defined in such a way that there exist states whose free field energy 

is less than the vacuum state.  A possible way to do this was discussed in [2,4].  

5. The Vacuum current 

 

At this point we have proved that there is a mathematical inconsistency in some of 

the elements that make up formal QED.  In order to examine this inconsistency further 

we will solve equation (13) for an actual problem.  In order to evaluate (13) for a given 

applied electromagnetic field we need to be able to determine the current and charge 

expectation values which is a complicated problem.  However, if the initial state is the 

vacuum state  0  then there are expressions from the literature that give the current and 

charge expectation value as a function of the applied electromagnetic field for small 

fields.  So in the limit that the applied electromagnetic field is small the we can solve 

equation (13) if the initial state is  0 .  In this paper the results of G. Scharf [5] will be 

used.

Using standard 4-vector notation the Fourier transform of the vacuum current is 

given in terms of the Fourier transform of the electric potential by (See Section 2.10 of

Now we will work the following problem.  At the initial time  t

i = −∞

 assume that 

the system is in the vacuum state 

0  and the applied electric potential is zero.  Next 

apply a non-zero electric potential.  According to the Schrödinger equation (1) this will 

cause the initial vacuum state to evolve into some other state

(

t

.  

Assume that this applied electrical potential is sufficiently small so that we can use 

equation (42) for the vacuum current.  Using the results for the vacuum current in (13) we 

can then solve for

where the quantity  O A  means terms to the third order in the electric potential or

higher.  The rest of the expression on the right of the equals sign is to the second order in 

the electric potential when we use (42) for the vacuum current.  Therefore we will drop 

the 

(
3O A

)

 term and just assume the electric potential is sufficiently small for the 

equality to hold to the second order.   

16

 

 

 

Now let us apply the above results to the following problem.  Assume that the 

system is in initially in the vacuum state.  Apply a classical current which is given by,

confirms that there is a mathematical inconsistency in the formal theory. 

6. Conclusion. 

 

We have examined some of the elements of the formal theory of QED.  These 

were the Schrödinger equation introduced in Section 1,  a requirement that the free field 

energy of the state vectors is non-negative as discussed in Section 2, and the assumption 

of gauge invariance as discussed in Section 3.  It was shown that these elements are not 

mathematically consistent.  In addition we solved Eq. (13) for the case where the initial 

state is the vacuum state.  We did this by using results from the literature for the vacuum 

17

 

 

 

 

 

 

current.  This allowed us to solve for the vacuum current, electric field, and vector 

potential for the case when the applied current given by Eq. (45).  This confirms the 

results of the previous section.  It is evident that for the formal theory of QED to be 

mathematically consistent then there must exist state vectors whose free field energy is 

negative with respect to the vacuum state. 

Appendix  

We want to solve (44) for the case where the applied current is given by Eq. (45) 

and the initial state is the vacuum state.  This allows us to use (42) for the vacuum 

current.  First take the Fourier transform of (45) to obtain,

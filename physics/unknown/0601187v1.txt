Abstract. We compare the results obtained by interpreting some fundamental relativistic 
experiments  from  the  point  of  view  of  two  alternative  theories:  Einstein’s  special 
relativity  theory  and  the  Lorentz-Poincare  theory  admitting  the  existence  of  a  special 
reference  frame  relative  to  which  we  can  measure  absolute  velocities.  The  experiments 
that we consider here are the time dilation, the radar echo, the Doppler Effect and the 
radar  detection.  The  most  important  result  is  that  both  theories  lead  to  the  Lorentz-
Einstein  transformations  for  the  space-time  coordinates  of  the  same  event.  This 
conclusion enables us to assert that the anisotropy in the light propagation fades away in 
the case of these particular experiments.  
 
 
1. Introduction 
There  are  two  competitive  approaches  to  the  relativity  theory,  which 
 
differ  in  essence  in  the  aspect  of  admitting  or  denying  the  possibility  to 
measure the absolute velocity of particles: 

1.  In  the  first  approach  the  concepts  of  “really  resting”  and  “really 

moving” are meaningless (Einstein). 

2.  In the second approach there is indeed a state of real rest defined by 
the “ether” even tough the laws of physics conspire by preventing us 
to identify it experimentally (Lorentz-Poincare)1. 

This problem has many facets (convention in the synchronization of distant 
clocks,  immeasurability  of  the  one-way  speed  of  light,  anisotropy  of  light 
propagation) being covered largely in the literature2.
 
The first approach starts by stating Einstein’s principle of relativity: 

- 

- 

the  laws  of  physics  are  the  same  in  all  inertial  reference  frames  in 
relative motion, 
the light propagates in all directions with the same speed c relative to 
all  inertial  reference  frames  and  is  not  influenced  by  the  state  of 
motion or rest of the light source. 

The second approach starts by stating that: 

 

1

-  some medium exists (called “ether”) as well as an absolute reference 
frame  attached  to  it,  in  which  the  light  propagates  in  free  space  in  a 
straight line with the same speed c in all directions, 
in any other inertial reference frame the two-way propagation velocity 
of light is invariant.  

- 

Others state:  

-  all  good  clocks  can  be  used  to  measure  time,  independently  of  the 

- 

periodic physical phenomena they are built upon, 
time is measured in the same way in all inertial reference frames, i.e., 
if a particular clock can be used to measure time in the “rest system”, 
a  similar  clock  can  be  used  to  measure  time  in  any  other  moving 
inertial frame 

-  a speed limit exists in the rest “system”.3     

 
Let  K(XOY)  be  the  rest  frame  relative  to  which  we  measure  the 
absolute speed of particles. For Einstein’s theory it represents an arbitrarily 
chosen inertial reference frame. According to Lorentz’s theory it is a unique 
reference frame (discovered by chance i.e. don’t ask how) relative to which 
we are able to measure absolute speeds. The light propagates relative to it, in 
free space, in all directions with the same speed c independently of the speed 
of  the  source.  Let  K’(X’O’Y’)    be  another    inertial  reference  frame.  In 
Einstein’s special relativity it moves with constant speed u relative to K in 
the positive direction of the common OX(O’X’) axes, the light propagating 
relative to it under the same conditions as in K. In the Lorentz approach K’ 
moves with absolute velocity u relative to K, the light propagating relative to 
K’  with  different  speeds  in  different  directions.  Considering  only  the 
common  OX(O’X’)  axes,  the  light  propagates in its positive direction with 
speed c+ but with speed c- in its negative direction. The c+ and c- represent 
one-way velocities of light. Consider the following experiment performed in 
K’, having the properties imposed by Lorentz.  Let L0 be the proper length of 
a rod located along the O’X’. It is at rest relative to K’. A source of light at 
rest in K’ is located at its left end with a mirror being located at its right end. 
The  source  emits  a  light  signal,  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  O’X’  axis, 
that returns back, after reflection, to the left end. The trip of the light signals 
lasts:

All experiments performed in order to measure the speed of light may only 
determine  its  two-way  speed  c.  The  trip  of  the  light  signal  expressed  as  a 
function of the two-way light speed lasts:

and their wrist watches 

As  usually  the  corresponding  axes  of  the  two  frames  are  parallel  to 
 
each  other,  the  OX(O’X’)  axes  are  common  and  at  the  origin  of  time  the 
origins  O  and  O’  are  located  at  the  same  point  in  space.  In  the  reference 
frame K we have the rest observers

located  at  the  different  points  x

synchronize their clocks following a synchronization procedure proposed by 
Einstein. In the reference frame K’ we find the observers 
 and their 
. In Einstein’s approach we can also synchronize them 
wristwatches 
following his procedure. In the Lorentz approach Einstein’s synchronization 
procedure  doesn’t  work  and  consequently  other,  less  or  more  feasible 
synchronization procedures are proposed. In our approach an important part 
is played by the observers 
 located at the corresponding 
origins  O  and  O’  and  by  their  wristwatches 
.  An 
initialization procedure can ensure that the clocks 
 read a 
zero time when they are located at the same point in space.  
 
Consider a given physical object located somewhere in space. In order 
to  characterize  it  the  physicists  invent  physical  quantities.  Performing 
experiments 
that  establish  a 
relationship  between  different  physical  quantities.  The  physical  object  can 
be  studied  by  observers  from  K  and  by  observers  from  K’  as  well.  The 
problem of relativity is to find out a relationship between the same physical 
quantity, introduced to characterize the same physical object as measured by 
observers from K and respectively K’.  
 
should lead to the same results if we follow scenarios in which:

 and 

•  Clock  synchronization  is  not  performed  nor  in  K  neither  in  K’ 
because  the  anisotropy  in  the  light  propagation  has  no  occasion  to 
manifest itself,

•  Clock synchronization is performed in K but not in K’ because both 
theories  agree  that  clock  synchronization  could  be  performed  in  K 
(following Einstein’s clock synchronization procedure) but not in K’,  
•  Two-way  experiments  are  performed  in  both  reference  frames  and 
the  observers  from  the  two  frames  operate  exclusively  with  the  two-
way speed of light considering it a true relativistic invariant. 

 
We will revise the following particular experiments: 

•  The time dilation4: An experiment that requires clock synchronization 

in K but not in K’, 

•  The  radar  echo4:  A  two-way  experiment  that  doesn’t  require  clock 

synchronization in the reference frames involved, 

•  The  relativistic  Doppler  Effect4:  An  experiment  that  doesn’t  require 

clock synchronization in any of the reference frames involved, 

•  The radar detection5: An experiment that has a two-way character in 

both frames. 

 
2. Time dilation 
 
Many textbooks6 use the light clock shown in figure 1 for deriving the 
 
time  dilation  formula.  We  use  it  for  showing  that  it  relates  a  proper  time 
interval to a non-proper time interval: 

- 

- 

 0C′

the first is measured in K’ as a difference between the readings of the 
same clock 
the  second  is  measured  as  a  difference  between  the  readings  of  two 
distant  clocks  of  the  K  frame,  synchronized  following  a  clock 
synchronization  procedure proposed by Einstein. 

 
Figure 1.a shows how the clock 
period 
equates  the  reading

T ′   of  the  light  clock  at  rest  in  K’.  The  period  T ′   of  the  light  clock

violate the postulates on which they are based.  
 
2. The radar echo 
 
The  radar  echo  experiment  performed  in  the  K  frame  involves  a 
 
source  of  light  S0  located  at  O,  the  observer 
.  A 
mirror  M  is  moving  with  speed  u  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  OX  axis 
being  located  in  front  of  S
0  reads  t=0  the 
0C
source  S0  emits  a  first  light  signal  that  is  instantly  received  and  reflected 
back by the mirror. A second light signal is emitted when C0 reads te arriving 
at  the  mirror  when  a  clock  C  of  the  K  frame  located  just  in  front  of  the 
mirror  reads  t.  The  reflected  light  signal  arrives  at  R0  when  his  wristwatch 
reads tr. We write the obvious equations that expresses in two different ways 
the distances travelled by the mirror and by the direct and the reflected rays 
respectively as  
 
 
and 
 
 
Eliminating t between (7) and (8) we obtain

Considering  that  Te=te-0  represents  the  period  at  which  the  source  emits 
successive  light  signals  and  that  Tr=tr-0  represents  the  period  at  which  the 
reflected signals are received back, we can present (9) as

We underline that the time intervals Te and Tr are time intervals measured as 
differences  between  the  readings  of  the  same  clock  C0  and  therefore  no 
clock synchronization is involved.  
We have followed so far the first step of a hint that states: “When you 
 
have  a  situation  which  you  don’t  fully  understand  find  a  new  reference 
frame in which you do understand it. Examine it in this new reference frame. 
Then  translate  your  understanding  that  you  gained  in  the  new  frame  back 
into the language of the old frame.”7  Following the second step switch over 
to  the  K’  frame  in  the  Lorentz  approach.  The  observer 
  knowing  the 
properties  of  his  rest  frame  and  performing  the  radar  echo  experiment 
obtains

The important conclusion here is that the radar echo experiment leads to the 

invariant combinations of c and u+ and respectively of 

 and 

. This is 

0C

 being by definition a proper time interval. One observer 

why we can say that in the case of the radar echo experiment the anisotropy 
in the propagation of light fades away. 
 
 3. The Doppler Effect 
 
 
A Doppler Effect experiment involves in one of its simplest variants a 
stationary  source  of  light  S0  that  emits  successive  light  signals  at  constant 
time intervals Te measured as a difference between the readings of the same 
clock 
 moving 
with constant speed u
+ relative to K receives these light signals at constant 
 measured as a difference between the readings of his wrist 
time intervals 
 being by definition a proper time interval as well. The two periods

Because the postulates on which these two approaches are based don’t 
 
conflict in the case of the relativistic Doppler Effect we conclude that all the 
equations derived above shall hold exactly and shall lead to the same results. 
Convincingly  we  can  prove  it  by  expressing  the  right  side  of  (21)  as  a 
function of physical quantities measured in K’ or expressing the right hand 
side  of  (22)  as  a  function  of  physical  quantities  measured  in  K  via  the 
corresponding transformation equations derived above. This proves that the 
combination of physical quantities under the square root in (21) and (22) is a 
true invariant. 
 
4. Radar detection of the space-time coordinates of the same event 
 
The  radar  detection  procedure  of  the  space  time  coordinates  of  a 
 
distant  event  performed  in  the  K  frame,  involves  the  observer 
  and  his 
. In order to detect the space-time coordinates of an event he 
wrist watch
emits  a  light  signal  towards  the  point  where  the  event  E(x,0,t)  takes  place 
when  C
0  reads  te.  The  light  signal  is  reflected  by  a  mirror  M(x,o)  located 
where  the  event  takes  place  when  a  further  clock  C(x,o)  of  the  K  frame 
synchronized  with  clock  C0  reads  t.  The  reflected  light  signal  returns  to  O 
when clock C0 reads tr. We write the obvious equations 
 
and 
 
 
which  express  in  two  different  ways  the  distances  travelled  by  the  emitted 
and  respectively  the  reflected  light  signals.  Eliminating  t  between  (23)  and

In a consequent Lorentz approach9 the space coordinates of the same 
 
event transform in accordance with (32). An important conclusion is that in 
the case of the radar detection (a two-way experiment) both theories lead to 
the Lorentz-Einstein transformation, an unexpected result showing that it is 
not  correct  to  argue  like  “Poincare  versus  Einstein”  but  it  is  better  to  state 
“Poincare hand in hand with Einstein”.

Furthermore we have shown that the anisotropy fades away also in the 
 
case  of  the  relativistic  effects  in  which  synchronized  clocks  are  involved 
only in the K frame (time dilation) or no synchronization is involved in any 
frame (radar echo and radar detection). Both relativistic approaches lead to 
the  same  results  concerning  the  transformation  equations  of  the  space-time 
coordinates. A difference still persists concerning the symmetry. 
The  surprising  result  that  both  theories  lead  to  the  Lorentz-Einstein 
 
transformation  for  the  space-time  coordinates  of  the  same  event  suggests 
that they should lead to the same results in all other cases.

ABSTRACT: An understanding of the precise nature of a chemical reactivity descriptor 

is of utmost interest to quantum chemists. In the present investigation an attempt has been 

made to analyze whether the electrophilicity index is a reliable descriptor of the kinetic 

behaviour.  Relative  experimental  rates  of  Friedel-  Crafts  benzylation,  acetylation  and 

benzoylation  reactions  correlate  well  with  the  corresponding  calculated  electrophilicity 

values.  Chlorination  of  various  substituted  ethylenes  and  nitration  of  toluene  and 

chlorobenzene  are  studied  as  representative  examples  of  electrophilic  addition  and 

substitution reactions respectively. The correlation is not very good to assess that which, 

however,  improves  drastically  by  removing  a  few  data  points  to  show  that  the 

electrophilicity  is  a  kinetic  quantity  with  inherent  thermodynamic  information.  The 

correlation between the experimental and the calculated activation energies is studied for 

some  Markovnikov  and  anti-Markovnikov  addition  reactions  and  is  turned  out  to  be 

reasonably  well.  Reaction  electrophilicity,  local  electrophilicity  and  activation  hardness 

are  used  together  to  provide  a  transparent  picture  of  reaction  rates  as  well  as  the 

orientation of aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions. Ambiguity in the definition of 

the electrophilicity is highlighted.

Introduction 

Many of the organic reactions can be described in terms of the electro (nucleo) philic 

addition and substitution. These reactions have got large synthetic potentials and are most 

widely  studied  [1,  4].  Traditionally  the  electrophilicity  is  treated  [1,  4]  as  a  kinetic 

quantity,  which  explains  the  rate  of  a  reaction  through  its  correlation  with  activation 

energy  or  free  energy  of  activation  occasionally  supplemented  by  thermodynamic 

stabilities  of  various  species  involved.  On  the  other  hand,  the  nucleophilicity  and  the 

basicity are often analyzed at par [1, 4] since both involves the amount of electron density 

present in it and its potential to donate that, although the former correlates with 

‡G∆

 (a 

kinetic  quantity)  and  the  latter  with 

  (an  equilibrium  or  thermodynamic  property). 

rG∆

Although it has been known for a long time that the electrophilicity is a cardinal index of 

reactivity and selectivity, an acceptable definition of it was lacking. Based on the work of 

Maynard et al [5] a theoretical definition of electrophilicity has been introduced recently 

by Parr et al. [6] It may be noted that Maynard et al [5] and Parr et al [6] have prescribed 

the  same  definition  of  electrophilicity  through  essentially  kinetic  (via  correlation  with 

reaction rates) and thermodynamic (in terms of the energetically favorable charge transfer 

processes) routes respectively and hence it is expected that it will contain both kinetic and 

thermodynamic information. This electrophilicity, however does not correlate well with 

the electron affinity [6]. 

Density functional theory [7, 8] has been quite successful in providing theoretical 

background  of  popular  qualitative  chemical  concepts.  In  this  context,  several  reactivity 

descriptors  have  been  proposed  and  used  to  analyze  chemical  reactivity  and  site 

selectivity.  Hardness,  global  softness,  electronegativity  and  polarizability  are  the  global 

 

 

2

reactivity descriptors widely used to understand the global nature of molecules in terms 

of their stability and it is possible to gain knowledge about the reactivity of molecules. 

Atomic  charges,  Fukui  functions  (FF)  and  local  softness  are  the  local  reactivity 

descriptors,  which  provide  information  about  the  site  selectivity.  In  addition  to  these 

reactivity  descriptors,  Hard  and  Soft  Acids  and  Bases  (HSAB)  principle  has  been 

employed  in  number  of  cases  in  analyzing  both  nucleophilicity  and  basicity,  which 

encapsulates both thermodynamic and kinetic properties of numerous molecules [9, 10]. 

A hard (soft) nucleophile prefers to react with a hard (soft) electrophile for both kinetic 

and  thermodynamic  considerations  and  for  two  species  of  comparable  electronegativity 

values [9, 10]. 

Zhou  and  Parr  [11]  have  defined  the  activation  hardness  and  investigated  the 

electrophilic substitution of aromatic compounds using that. It is expected that the electro 

(nucleo)  philicity  should  have  both  kinetic  and  thermodynamic  requirements.  The  main 

objective  of  the  present  work  is  to  gain  insights  into  the  exact  nature  (kinetic  or 

thermodynamic) of the electrophilicity index. Different types of Friedel- Crafts reactions 

like  benzylation,  acetylation  and  benzoylation  are  studied  to  correlate  the  experimental 

rates  of  those  reactions  with  the  corresponding  theoretical  electrophilicity  values. 

Reliability  of  calculated  activation  energies  and  the  problems  associated  with  the 

definition of electrophilicity for more than one species are also discussed. Chlorination of 

various substituted ethylenes and nitration of toluene and chlorobenzene are taken as the 

representative  reactions  encompassing  the  electrophilic  addition  and  substitution 

respectively.

Theoretical Background 

described below. 

Activation  hardness:  Zhou  and  Parr  [11]  have  proposed  the  activation  hardness  in 

accordance with the transition state (TS) theory. The activation hardness is defined as

where

 is the activation hardness, 

Rη is the hardness of the reactant and 

TSη

 is the 

hardness of the transition state. Zhou and Parr [11] have shown that smaller the activation 

hardness, the faster is the reaction. 

 

One of the difficulties associated with the calculation of hardness of the reactants 

is that the hardness of the chemical species is not additive. The hardness of two chemical 

species, viz., A, the acceptor and D, the donor is calculated by the relationship [11]

where 

DI

 is the ionization potential of the donor and  A  is the electron affinity of the

Electrophilicity: Electrophilicity index ( ω) has been defined by Parr et al [6] as

In  Eq.  (3)    µ  ≈  -(I+A)/2  and  η  ≈  (I-A)/2  are  the  electronic  chemical  potential  and  the 

chemical hardness respectively, approximated in terms of the vertical ionization potential 

(I) and electron affinity (A). The electrophilicity is a descriptor of reactivity that allows a

quantitative classification of the global electrophilic nature of a molecule within a relative 

scale and effectively is the power of a system to ‘soak up’ electrons [6]. 

The local version of the electrophilicity index has been proposed by employing a 

resolution of identity as follows [12]: 

                                   

                                                                  (4)

where fk is the Fukui function at atom k in a molecule and (α= +, - and 0) represents local 

philic  quantities  describing  nucleophilic,  electrophilic  and  radical  attacks  respectively. 

Since,  electrophilicity  measures  the  energy  change  of  an  electrophile  as  it  is  saturated 

with  electrons,  it  may  be  considered  to  be  an  additive  parameter.  This  property  of 

electrophilicity  has  been  used  in  this  study  to  define  new  reactivity  quantities  such  as 

activation electrophilicity and reaction electrophilicity. 

Activation electrophilicity: Consider the following chemical reaction

For  the  reactions  involving  more  than  one  reactant  or  product  the  definition  of 

electrophilicity becomes ambiguous. We consider here some of the probable definitions. 

For a reaction of the type: A+B → TS → C+D we may define the electrophilicity of the 

reactant as:

Computational Details 

  

General reaction scheme for all the reactions considered in the study is presented 

in scheme I. All the geometries of the molecules concerned are  optimized  in gas  phase 

using  Becke’s  three  parameter  hybrid  density  functional,  [13]  B3LYP/6-31G*,  which 

includes both Hartree-Fock exchange and DFT exchange correlation functionals [14,15] 

using  the  Gaussian  98W  [16]  package.  The  minimum  energy  configurations  of  the 

reactants, intermediates and products and the saddle point nature of the transition states 

have been ensured with the help of the corresponding calculated vibrational frequencies. 

The reactants, intermediates and products are associated with zero imaginary frequencies, 

whereas there is one imaginary frequency for each transition state. Reactivity descriptors 

like  chemical  hardness  and  electrophilicity  index  have  been  calculated  using  standard 

working  equations  described  earlier.  AIM  analyses  for  the  π-complexes  are  carried  out 

with  the  help  of  AIM  2000  software  package  [17].  The  thermodynamic  parameters  for 

various  reactions  have  been  computed  by  the  standard  method  implemented  in  the 

Gaussian  package  [16].  Using  the  freq  keyword,  the  free  energies  of  various  reactions 

have been computed at T= 298.15K. From the calculated free energies of the transition 

states (GTS) and those of reactants (GR), the free energy of activation have been obtained 

by ∆G‡= GTS-GR. From the free energies of products (GP) and the reactants (GR), the free 

energy of reaction have been calculated using the following equation ∆Gr=GP-GR.

benzylation, acetylation and benzoylation reactions studied here are collected in     Figure

are  taken  from  reference  [18]  and  are  correlated  with  the  calculated  electrophilicity 

values.  Table  I  presents  the  theoretical  ω  values  along  with  the  experimental  and 

calculated 

ln(RR

)

 values. 

 

As  we  see  in  Figure  2,  the  experimental  ln(

)RR

  values  for  none  of  the 

benzylation, acetylation and benzoylation reactions correlate very well with the ω values. 

However, the correlation improves significantly (R=0.928, 0.898, 0.993) once we neglect 

some  of  the  points.  Mainly  the  nitro-  and  chloro-  substituted  compounds  in  the 

benzylation  reactions  and  highly  fluoro-  substituted  and  crowded  molecules  in  the 

benzoylation  reactions  exhibit  different  behaviour  than  the  rest.  It  may,  however,  be 

noted  that  there  is  no  a  priori  method  known  to  judge  those  points  causing  the 

“discrepancies” and to provide a rationale for that. Perhaps it stems from the quality of 

the  experiments  and/or  the  definition  of  electrophilicity  (to  especially  take  care  of  the 

kinetic aspects) and its method of calculation. Currently we are exploring the dependence 

of the reaction rates on both the global and the local electrophilicities. Preliminary results 

are  very  encouraging.  This  may  allow  us  to  consider  the  electrophilicity  as  a  kinetic 

quantity and may be used in estimating the rate of a chemical reaction and consequently 

the  associated  Hammett  constant  and  the  nucleus  independent  chemical  shift,  wherever 

 
applicable [19].

It  is  not  always  easy  to  gather  the  experimental  rates  and  reaction  energies  of 

several  reactions  to  come  to  a  definite  conclusion.  In  order  to  bypass  this  problem  we 

propose to calculate the activation and reaction energies of some reactions. For gaining 

 

 

8

confidence  we  first  calculate  the  activation  energies  of  some  Markovnikov  and  anti-

Markovnikov  addition  reactions  of  hydrogen  halides  to  alkenes  whose  experimental 

activation energies are known [20]. Table II presents the activation and reaction energies 

as  well  as  the  experimental  activation  energies  obtained  from  a  synchrotron  radiation 

experiment [20]. A linear correlation (Figure 3, R=0.970) between the experimental and 

the  theoretical  activation  energies  provides  confidence  and  helps  us  to  proceed  further 

with the corresponding theoretical quantities for the following reactions. 

 

Chlorination  of  various  substituted  ethylenes:  In  chlorination  of  various  substituted 

ethylenes, chlorine acts as an electrophile and π-electrons of the substituted ethylene are 

the nucleophile and the gas phase reaction proceeds via a cyclic chloronium bridged ion 

[1,  4].  The  substituted  ethylene  and  chlorine  form  a  π-complex  before  forming  the 

transition state. The π-electrons attack the chlorine and displace a chlorine ion to form a 

cationic cyclic chloronium ion as an intermediate. This step proceeds via a transition state 

that involves breaking of the Cl- Cl bond as well as breaking the π-bond in the substituted 

ethylene  in  a  concerted  manner.  Formation  of  chloronium  ion  is  the  slow  and  the  rate-

determining step. Therefore, the transition state formed in the rate-determining step is of 

much interest in calculating activation quantities. 

Figure  4  is  reserved  for  the  structures  and  selected  bond  lengths  for  these 

transition states (not shown because of space constraints). Chlorine (Cl2) and substituted 

ethylenes  (CH2CHR)  are  the  reactants.  Final  anti  product  is  the  product  considered  for 

calculating  reaction  quantities.  Various  substituents  on  ethylene  influence  the  rate  of 

electrophilic  addition  to  it.  It  is  well  known  that  electron-withdrawing  substituents 

decrease the reactivity whereas electron-donating ones increase the reactivity.

In  the  present  study  the  existence  of  a  weak  complex  between  substituted 

ethylenes  and  Cl2  have  been  analyzed  with  the  help  of  an  atoms-in-molecule  (AIM) 

approach developed by Bader and his group [21] by locating the critical points at which 

the gradient of electron density vanishes. The topographical features, i.e. the presence of 

bond critical points between the C atom and Cl2, the value of the electron density at the 

bond critical points ( ρ

substituted  ethylenes  studied,  the  NO2-  and  NO-  substituents  are  the  most  deactivating 

systems  towards  an  electrophilic  addition  reaction.  For  these  two  cases  the  π-  complex 

formation with Cl2 was not observed.

  is also attempted and are depicted in Figure 9. 

               It  is  evident  from  Figure  8  that  reaction  electrophilicity  exhibits  a  poor  linear

with

  and  thereby  confirming  that

However,

 does not show any linear relationship with these kinetic quantities. It may 

be noted that the

 versus  

rω  are not negligible and 

almost  comparable  to  that  of  the  plots  of

  (Figure  9).  The

hardness is also a kinetic parameter.  

Nitration of toluene and chlorobenzene: In an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction 

the electrophile replaces a proton from the ortho, meta or para position or another Lewis 

acid leaving group from the ipso position. The electrophile in the nitration reactions is the 

nitronium ion (NO2

+) formed via reaction of HNO3 and H2SO4. The reaction proceeds [1, 

4] through any of the three possible intermediates, viz. two types of π - complexes and a 

σ  -  complex,  called  a  benzenium  ion.  All  of  these  intermediates  are  stable  species  as 

vindicated by their nmr spectra. It has been long believed that the transition states (late) 

associated  with  electrophilic  aromatic  substitutions  resemble  the  σ  -  complexes  more 

than  the  two  types  of π  -  complexes  and  the  formation  of  the σ  -  complex  is  the  rate 

determining  step  in  most  cases  and  is  irreversible  for  all  practical  purposes  in  many 

reactions.  This  leads  to  the  general  rules  governing  these  reactions  as  [1]  a)  Electron 

donating (-I) groups increase the rates (activate by stabilizing the TS for the σ - complex 

formation) and direct the electrophile predominantly to the ortho- or the para- positions 

and  b)  Electron  withdrawing  (+I)  groups  decrease the rates (deactivate by destabilizing 

the TS for the σ - complex formation) and direct the electrophiles predominantly to the 

meta- positions. Of course the resonance effects ( M) of the substituents are also to be 

±

considered in understanding their effects on rates. It may be noted that in other text books 

(e.g. references [3] and [4]) electron donating and withdrawing effects are designated as 

(+I,  +M)  and  (-I,  -M)  respectively.  At  high  temperature  all  groups  show  preferences 

towards the meta- positions mainly because of thermodynamic control. It is expected that 

 

12

the reactions are effectively kinetically controlled at the temperature (298.15 K) in which 

the  free  energies  are  calculated.  Partial  rate  factors  are  argued  [1,  4]  to  be  better 

descriptors of the substituent effects on rates than their relative rates. Both –CH3 and –Cl 

groups  are  ortho-  para  directing  although  the  former  is  activating  (-I)  and  the  latter  is 

deactivating (+I) but having pronounced resonance effects. Various transition states and 

σ  -  complexes  associated  with  the  nitration  of  toluene  and  chlorobenzene  are  stored  in 

Figure  10  (not  shown).  Table  VII  reports  the  electrophilicity  values  of  all  the  species 

involved  in  these  reactions.  Their  relative  energies  and  electrophilicities  are  provided 

respectively in Figures 11 and 12. It is important to note that the transition states and the 

intermediates are always more electrophilic than the reactants and the products. 

 Table VIII presents ωr, Er, 

‡ω

, 

‡E

 and  η  of these species. It is clear from the 

‡

 values that both –CH

3 and –Cl will be o-p directing. Although the 

‡η

 values properly 

take care of –CH

3 it fails in case of –Cl. In case of intramolecular reactivity, ωr does not 

correlate well with 

‡E

 which may be due to the fact that the reactant is the same in all 

cases.  However,  ω

r  (like

‡E )  values  of  the  m-products  are  larger  than  those  of  the  o-p 

products in both cases. 

The philicity (

) values of toluene and chlorobenzene are reported in Table IX. 

−ωk

They clearly reveal that both –CH

3 and –Cl are o-p directing and are found to be better 

descriptors  of  orientation  of  aromatic  electrophilic  substitutions  than

.  Note  that  the 

‡η

respective Fukui functions will suffice in case the intramolecular reactivity is considered.

Concluding Remarks 

 

In  order  to  test  the  potential  of  the  electrophilicity as a descriptor of the kinetic 

characteristics,  Friedel-  Crafts  benzylation,  acetylation  and  benzoylation  reactions, 

electrophilic  addition  to  various  substituted  ethylenes  and  electrophilic  aromatic 

substitution reactions in toluene and chlorobenzene are studied. It has been observed that 

if  a  few  systems  are  neglected  the  electrophilicity  correlates  very  well  with  the 

experimental rates and hence is essentially a kinetic concept but it has also inherited an 

adequate amount of thermodynamic information due to their intercorrelations. Different 

ways  of  defining  electrophilicity  for  reactants  and  products  are  discussed.  A  linear 

correlation  between  the  experimental  and  the  calculated  activation  energies  for  some 

Markovnikov  and  anti-Markovnikov  addition  of  hydrogen  halides  to  alkenes  are 

observed.  Reaction  electrophilicity  complements  activation  hardness  concept 

in 

understanding  the  rates  of  the  electrophilic  addition  and  substitution  reactions  and  to 

some  extent  the  stability  of  the  associated  products  as  well.  Philicity  also  adequately 

describes the orientation of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions.

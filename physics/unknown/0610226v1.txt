Abstract. Observers of the uniformly accelerating observers or the observers who make 
up the system of uniformly accelerating observers reach the same velocity V at different 
times  ti  which  depends  on  V  and  on  theirs  acceleration  gi.  Considering  a  platform  that 
moves  with  constant  velocity  V,  the  observers  can  land  on  it  smoothly.  Their  ages  and 
locations  in  the  inertial  reference  frame  attached  to  the  platform  are  reckoned  and 
compared. 
 
 
1. Introduction  
 
 
For the purpose of the analysis below we will use the same scenario 
that we considered in a previous paper1: point-like observers equipped with 
identical clocks are initially in state of rest being located at the origin O of 
the K(XOY) inertial reference frame. When all their clocks read a zero time 
the  observers  start  moving  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  OX  axis  with 
different  proper  accelerations  gi.  Let 
  be  one  of  these  observers.  In 
accordance with the special relativity theory the acceleration gi can change 
 
in  the  range  of  values  0<gi< ∞ .  This  particular  motion  of  observer 
)
relative to frame K (also known as the hyperbolic motion2) is described by 
the equation:

The first problem we are confronted with is to find out the geometric 
locus of the points in the space-time diagram where all the velocities of the 
accelerating  observers  are  equal  to  V,  that  is  to  say  the  iso-velocity  lines. 
Eliminating gi between (1) and (2) we obtain that this locus is given by

Consider a very long platform that moves with constant velocity V in 
 
the  positive  direction  of  the  OX  axis  and  let  K’(X’O’Y’)  be  the  inertial 
reference frame commoving with this platform. The origin O’ of frame K’ is 
located at the middle point of the platform. At the time t given by (4), when

platform. Detected from the frame K’ and in  accordance with the Lorentz-

2. Differently accelerated twins without differential aging 
 
 
Some  students  still  struggle  with  the idea  that  the  acceleration  is  the 
root  cause  of  differential  aging  in  the  classical  twin  paradox.  To  convince 
them about the contrary an ideal scenario should exhibit differential aging in 
the absence of differential acceleration between the twins. Some authors3-14 
have  been  successful  in  this  regard  but  they  ignore  the  small  intervals  of 
acceleration at the point of return or they need to alter the original scenario 
(one of the twins remains at home while the second travels away with high-
velocity, subsequently turning around and speeding up to return home where 
it finds that its twin grew older).  
A  particular  scenario  known  as  the  Boughn’s  version  of  the  twins’ 
 
paradox10 maintains much of the original flavour of the classical paradox. In 
this  experiment  the  twins  experience  identical  acceleration  and  yet  present 
differential  aging.  However,  as  pointed  out  by  Desloge  and  Philpott14  and 
later by Price and Gruber12 the twins in the Boughn’s scenario10  perform  a 
critical  initial  separation  prior  to  their  acceleration  and  they  should  be 
reunited  at  the  end  of  their  trip  (to  evaluate  their  ages)  all  of  which 
complicates the possible causes of differential aging. Moreover, even in the 
Boughn’s  scenario  some  acceleration  is  needed  to  cause  whatever  aging  is 
seen. Therefore, it still might appear to some students that the acceleration is 
the direct cause of different aging. 
 
Attempting  to  find  out  the  best  way  to  convince  someone  that 
 
acceleration per se is not the cause of differential aging, Gruber and Price13  
analysed the opposite scenario: a simple twin paradox with the twins being 
subject  to  acceleration,  but  (in  the  limit)  without  exhibiting  differential 
aging.  This  scenario  involved  a  rocket  undergoing  periodic  (harmonic) 
motion.  The  derived  equations  demonstrate  that  time  dilation  is  dependent 
on the maximum velocity but not on acceleration. However one weak point 

 

 

 

3

of this scenario is that the harmonic motion can’t be expressed by an easy to 
handle analytic function of the parameters characterizing the motion.  
 
smoothly on the platform moving with velocity V at the times 

  that  we  introduced  above  land

Considering  only  two  observers 
.  After  landing  on  the  platform,  the  clocks 
lands  first  followed  by 
attached  to  the  accelerated  observers  start  clicking  in  the  rhythm  of  the 
2C′   of  the  frame  K’  that  are  located  where  the 
synchronized  clocks 
landings  take  place.  The  result  is  that  at  the  instant  when 
  lands  on 
2C′  display the same time and from now on they will 
platform both 
display the same running time. It means that the two accelerating observers 
who  started  to  move  at  the  same  time  from  the  same  point  in  space  shall 
have the same age after landing. 
We  can  now  bring  these  two  observers  at  the  middle  of  the  distance 
 
that  separates  their  landing  points,  via  some  slow-speed  transport,  which 
doesn’t  affect  their  synchrony,  thereby  convincing  them  that  even  if  they 
underwent different accelerations, they aged in the same way.   
 
We  have  landed  so  far  the  observers  who  make  up  the  system  of 
uniformly  accelerating  observers  onto  a  moving  platform.  We  present  now 
another scenario which enables us to move all observers from the origin O of 
the  K  frame  where  they  are  initially  in  a  rest  state  to  another  point  of  the 
same reference frame where they achieve the rest state as well. This process 
involves  an  acceleration  phase  followed  by  a  deceleration  phase.  Form 
classical  physics  we  know  the  following  problem:  a  particle  starts  moving 
from  a  state  of  rest  performing  an  accelerating  motion  with  constant 
acceleration  g  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  OX  axis  of  the  inertial 
reference frame K(XOY). After a given time of motion t1 , when his velocity 
becomes  V,  the  acceleration  changes  its  sign  instantaneously  and  after  a 
second time of motion t2 the particle stops. Let L1 be the distance travelled 
during  the  period  of  acceleration  and  L2  the  distance  travelled  during  the 
period of deceleration. We have

resulting  that  the  distances  covered  during  the  two  motion  phases  and  the 
time intervals during which they are performed are equal to each other.  
Considering  that  the  clock  performs  the  hyperbolic  motion,  Lorio15

The landing of the observers on a platform that moves with constant velocity 
V in the positive direction of the OX axis is smooth if they land whilst they

As  we  see  from  equation  (24)  the  accelerating  observers  recover  after 
landing the same longitudinal distribution they had initially along the X axis 
in the K frame, i.e. the landing of the observers who make up the uniformly 
accelerating  reference  frame  doesn’t  change  their  positions  in  space.  From 
equation  (25)  we  also  see  that  these  observers  didn’t  age  differently.  But 
because the observers didn’t start from the same point in space this scenario 
doesn’t meet the conditions imposed by the classical twin paradox. 
 
 
 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
 
The study of the landing of accelerating observers on a platform that 
moves  with  constant  proper  accelerations  leads  to  interesting  results 
concerning  theirs  ages  and  locations  in  the  reference  co-moving  with  the 
platform.  Differently  accelerating  observers  age  in  the  same  way  in  the 
conditions imposed by the classical definition of the clock paradox.

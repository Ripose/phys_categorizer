Abstract

We explore the use of bi-orthogonal basis for continuous wavelet
transformations, thus relaxing the so-called admissibility condition on
the analyzing wavelet. As an application, we determine the eigen-
values and corresponding radial eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of
relativistic Hydrogen-like atoms.

I - Introduction

Wavelet transforms have been successfully used in Mathematics, Physics and
Engineering [1, 2, 3]. In particular, in the context of Quantum Mechanics,
continuous wavelet transforms have proved very useful, giving rise - for ex-
ample - to entirely new approaches to problems with spherical symmetry.
For nonrelativistic Hydrogen-like atoms, an adequate choice of the analyzing
wavelet reduces the radial Schr¨odinger equation to a ﬁrst order diﬀerential
equation, and the analyticity of wavelet coeﬃcients leads, in a straightfor-
ward manner, to the determination of the eigenvalues and their corresponding
eigenfunctions [4].

In this context, the selection of an analyzing wavelet is constrained by
the ”admissibility condition”, which guarantees the existence of an inverse
transform [5, 4]. On the other hand, bi-orthogonal basis have been introduced
in the context of discrete [6, 7] as well as continuous [8, 9, 10] transforms.

However, in some cases, computational convenience may suggest that the
most adequate ”analyzing wavelet” be a non-admissible and even a non-
square- integrable function. This is the case, for example, for relativistic
Hydrogen-like atoms, as we will see later.

It is the aim of this paper to extend the wavelet analysis to such situations,
where it is not possible to construct an orthogonal continuous basis of L2,
via the ”ax + b” transform of the analyzing wavelet.
In order to get an
invertible transformation, we will rather restrict ourselves to a subspace of
L2 (containing the bounded eigenstates of the Hamiltonian to be treated)
and make use of bi-orthogonal continuous basis.

In section 2, we consider the space where this wavelet transform is well
deﬁned and some of its properties. We propose suﬃcient conditions for a
function to belong to the space of wavelet coeﬃcients. Such conditions are
satisﬁed by the transformed eigenfunctions of the relativistic Hamiltonian to
be treated later.

In section 3, the radial Dirac equation is solved for relativistic Hydrogen-
like atoms. As in the nonrelativistic case presented in reference [4], the
analyticity of the space of coeﬃcients is shown to determine the spectrum.
Moreover, the aymptotic behaviour of functions in this space allows for a
determination of the associated eigenfunctions.

Finally, in section 4, we present some comments and conclusions.

1Notice that, following [5, 4] we are calling ψγ(q) the analyzing wavelet while, in the
literature, this term is usually reserved to its Fourier (anti-)transform. So, usual transfor-
mation and reconstruction formulae are related to equations (4,5,6) by Fourier transform
(see, for instance, references [1, 2, 7]).

Now, for 1/2 < γ < 1, the analyzing wavelet chosen is not an admissible
one [5]. So, in this range, it is not possible to construct an orthogonal basis
1/2, ψγ(q)
leading to the reconstruction formula (6). Moreover, for 0 < γ
is not even a square integrable function, so that the integral in equation (5)
doesn’t exist for an arbitrary f (q)

L2(R+, q2dq).

In what follows, we will be interested in showing that it is still possible
to use the transform in equation (5) for solving an eigenvalue problem, pro-
vided certain regularity conditions are satisﬁed by its solutions. We will also
analyze which properties of an authentic wavelet transform do still hold in
such a situation.

To this end, we will introduce a bi-orthogonal continuous basis. That is,
we will make use of diﬀerent functions in the process of analysis and later
reconstruction:

IV - Conclusions

In conclusion, we have explored the use of bi-orthogonal basis for continuous
wavelet transformations, a generalization which is aimed at relaxing the so-
called admissibility condition on the analyzing wavelet, and turns out to be
useful for computational reasons.

L1

loc(R+, qγdq)

For deﬁniteness, we have considered the radial dependence of functions in
R3. As is well known, choosing as analyzing wavelet the function in equation
(2), with γ > 1, the wavelet transform in equation (5) is an isometry between
the Hilbert spaces L2(R+, q2dq) and

B2γ−1.
In Lemma 1, we have studied the transformation acting on functions
f (q)
), dq)), with 0 < γ < 1, a region where the
analyzing wavelet is not admissible and can even be non square integrable.
We have shown that the transform F (¯z) so deﬁned is an analytic function
in the half-plane Im ¯z < 0, such that F (¯z)
→|Re z|→∞ 0, with Im z = a > 0,
and F (¯z)
→Im z→∞ 0, and that the transformation maps diﬀerential operators
acting on f (q) into diﬀerential operators acting on F (¯z). Moreover, we have
proved that, if f (q)

behaviour as given by equation (16) - the transformation has a right inverse

B2γ+1).

In Lemma 3, we have shown that the transformation deﬁned by equation
(5), for 0 < γ < 1, is a mapping between a dense subspace of L2(R+, q2dq)
and a dense subspace of a pre-Hilbert space
Aγ, which preserves the norm
(deﬁned in
Aγ in terms of the scalar product of derivatives in
Finally, as an example of the interest of our results, we have studied the
spectrum of relativistic Hydrogen-like atoms. We have shown that, in the
determination of eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian of this system and of their
associated radial eigenfunctions, a wavelet transformation can be employed,
and the calculation is greatly simpliﬁed by the choice γ = +√χ2
λ2. For
physical reasons, γ can be any real number greater than zero, which makes ap-
parent the need for our generalization of wavelet transforms. By applying the
results proved in our three Lemmas, we have determined the spectrum from
the requirement of analyticity on the transform, and we have reconstructed
the associated radial eigenfunctions through the use of a bi-orthogonal ba-
sis. Both the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions thus obtained can be seen to
coincide with standard results.

This paper completes and comments on some aspects of our previous publications. In 
ref [1], we have derived a set of space-time transformations referred to as the extended 
space-time  transformations.  These  transformations,  which  assume  the  existence  of  a 
preferred  aether  frame  and  the  variability  of  the  one-way  speed  of  light  in  the  other 
frames, are compared to the Lorentz-Poincaré transformations. We demonstrate that the 
extended transformations can be converted into a set of equations that have a similar 
mathematical  form  to  the  Lorentz-Poincaré  transformations,  but  which  differ  from 
them  in  that  they  connect  reference  frames  whose  co-ordinates  are  altered  by  the 
systematic  unavoidable  measurement  distortions  due  to  length  contraction  and  clock 
retardation  and  by  the  usual  synchronization  procedures,  a  fact  that  the  conventional 
approaches  of  relativity  do  not  show.  As  a  result,  we  confirm  that  the  relativity 
principle is not a fundamental principle of physics [i.e, it does not rigorously apply in 
the  physical  world  when  the  true  co-odinates  are  used].  It  is  contingent  and  applies 
exclusively  when  the  distorted  co-ordinates  are  used.  The  apparent  invariance  of  the 
speed  of  light  also  results  from  the  measurement  distortions.  The  space-time 
transformations  relating  experimental  data,  therefore,  conceal  hidden  variables  which 
deserved to be disclosed for a deeper understanding of physics. 

 
1. Introduction 
Special relativity regards the relativity principle as a fundamental principle of 
physics [2]. In other words the laws of physics must be identical in all inertial 
frames*.  But  a  fundamental  principle  supposes  that  the  variables  which  are 
involved in the laws are exactly measured in all these frames. If the principle 
applies exclusively when the measurement brings about a certain distortion of 
the variables, it loses its character as a fundamental principle of physics. Such 
a principle must be qualified as contingent. A contingent principle may have a 
certain  practical  value,  but  it  does  not  enable  us  to  directly  know  the 
mechanisms  which  determine  the  physical  processes,  and  it  gives  a  distorted 
view of reality. It is therefore justified to try and show the contingent character 
of  a  principle  when  it  is  suspected  and  to  determine  the  true  co-ordinates 
which are not altered by the measurement distortions. 
A  contingent  principle  is  not  absolute,  it  depends  on  the  conventions  chosen 
for  the  measurements;  if  we  use  other  conventions,  the  principle  will  not 

* Poincaré gives the principle a different formulation. According to Poincaré’s relativity principle, it 
would be impossible by means of an experiment internal to a given inertial frame to know whether this 
frame is in motion or at rest with respect to the aether frame. 

apply. It is important to check to what extent these considerations concern the 
relativity principle. The question will be developed in the following chapters. 
Most authors today ignore the existence of a preferred aether frame despite the 
experimental and theoretical arguments that have been developed recently [1]. 
Others  regard  the  relativity  principle  as  a  fundamental  principle  compatible 
with  the  existence  of  a  preferred  aether  frame  [3].They  believe  that  inertial 
frames really exist in the physical world, which implies their equivalence for 
the description of the physical laws. (But, as we have seen in ref [1],  except 
for  the  preferred  aether  frame,  real  frames  are  never  perfectly  inertial,  and 
although we will use this term which is sanctioned by use, we must be aware 
that it is an approximation only valid when the aether drift is weak).  
In  previous  publications  [1],  assuming  the  existence  of  a  preferred  aether 
frame and the variability of the one-way speed of light in the other frames, we 
have  derived  a  set  of  space-time  transformations,  referred  to  as  the  extended 
space-time transformations, which do not obey the relativity principle in that 
the  transformations  connecting  the  aether  frame  with  any  other  “inertial” 
frame  possess  a  mathematical  form  different  from  the  transformations 
connecting any pair of “inertial” frames. 
In the following chapters, we shall demonstrate that these transformations can 
be converted into transformations which assume the same mathematical form 
as the Lorentz-Poincaré transformations, but which fundamentally differ from 
them in that the co-ordinates of the reference frames they connect, are shown 
to be altered by systematic measurement distortions. In particular they depend 
on  a  questionable  synchronization  procedure  which  generates  a  synchronism 
discrepancy effect, whose magnitude varies with the pair of “inertial” frames 
these 
considered,  and 
transformations  will  not  apply.  Therefore,  only  the  laws  of  physics  relating 
distorted variables will be invariant and not the true laws.  
As an example of this fact, let us revisit the case of the two rockets receding 
from  one  another  along  a  same  line  in  a  frame  S  different  from  the  aether 
frame.  At  the  initial  instant,  the  rockets  meet  at  a  point  O,  and  then  they 
continue on their way, symmetrically, at speed v , towards two points A and B 
placed  at  equal  distance  of  point  O.  We  first  suppose  that  the  speeds  of  the 
rockets  are  exactly  measured.  At  the  initial  instant,  the  clocks  inside  the 
rockets  are  synchronized.  Of  course  the  rockets  have  different  speeds  with 
respect to the aether frame and, therefore, due to clock retardation, their clocks 
will  display  different  readings  when  they  reach  points  A  and  B  in 
contradiction  with  the  relativity  principle.  (Only  if  frame  S  was  at  rest  with 
respect to the aether frame, would they display the same reading). But if the 
speeds  of  the  rockets  are  measured  with  clocks  placed  at  A,  O  and  B 

the  synchronization  procedure, 

if  we  change

synchronized  by  means  of  the  Einstein-Poincaré  procedure  with  light  signals 
(or by slow clock transport) the clocks inside the rockets will display the same 
reading when they reach points A and B, a fact which seems in agreement with 
the relativity principle. This result follows from the systematic error made in 
measuring  the  speeds,  when,  using  the  Einstein-Poincaré  procedure,  one 
assumes the isotropy of the one way speed of light.  
But one cannot conclude that the relativity principle is a fundamental principle 
of physics in the physical world, if it depends on a synchronization procedure 
which gives rise to a measurement error. 
After  a  brief  reminder  of  the  extended  space-time  transformations,  we  shall 
compare  them  to  the  Lorentz-Poincaré  transformations,  making  a  distinction 
between Einstein’s approach, which denies the existence of a preferred aether 
frame,  and  Poincaré’s  approach,  which  assumes  such  an  aether  frame.  We 
shall  verify  that  our  approach  departs  completely  from  those  we  have  just 
transformations,  and

transformations result from the distortions affecting the Galilean co-ordinates, 
which are in fact the true co-ordinates. Although this fact is not recognized by 
the  conventional  approaches  of  relativity  theory,  it  concerns  all  the 
measurements carried out in the Earth frame. 
 
2.  Brief reminder of the extended space-time transformations 
We start from the space-time transformations connecting any pair of “inertial” 
frames  which  are  not  submitted  to  measurement  distortions.  These  Galilean 
transformations  are  not  those  which  are  determined  experimentally  because 
the  distortions  cannot  be  avoided  when  the  experiments  are  performed  (such 
distortions result from length contraction, clock retardation and arbitrary clock 
synchronization  [4]).  Submitting  the  Galilean  transformations  to  these 
distortions,  we  obtain  the  extended  space-time  transformations  which  enable 
us to show how the distortions act. Finally these transformations will be given 
another mathematical form that will permit us to easily compare our approach 
to the conventional approaches of special relativity.  
(If the reader is already familiar with the subject, he may skip this paragraph). 
Consider  to  this  end  three  co-ordinate  systems  S0,  S1and  S2  (Fig  1).  S0  is  at 
rest in the Cosmic substratum (aether frame), S1 and S2 are moving along the 
common  x-axis  with  rectilinear  uniform  motion.  We  propose  to  derive  the 
space-time transformations connecting the co-ordinate systems S1and S2.  
At the initial instant, the origins of the three co-ordinate systems O, O’ and O” 
are coincident. At this instant a vehicle coming from the 
 region passes by

When  the  vehicle  reaches  point  B,  it  meets  a  clock  equipped  with  a  mirror 
firmly  fixed to the system S1 and standing at a point B’ in this system  (so that 
when the vehicle arrives at point B, B and B’ are coincident (figure 1). 
  

 
   Figure1. When the vehicle reaches point B, it meets a clock equipped with a mirror  
                   firmly fixed to the system S1 at a point B’ in this system. 
 
Let us determine the distance and the time needed by the vehicle to reach point 
B from the point of view of an observer at rest with respect to the co-ordinate 
system S1. We shall first determine the true co-ordinates. 
When the vehicle has covered the distance  l  relative to point O’, the rod has 
moved with respect to the system S1 a distance equal to:

additional distance equal to:

Now,  in  order  to  measure  in  S1  the  time  needed  by  the  vehicle  to  reach 
point B, we must beforehand synchronize two clocks placed in O’ and B’. To 
this  end,  we  send  a  light  signal  from  O’  to  B’.  After  reflection  the  signal 
comes back to O’.

Relativity  theory,  despite  its  limitations,  has  permitted  the  formulation  of 
several  physical  laws,  and  therefore,  it  appears  legitimate  to  appreciate  the 
differences  between  conventional  relativity  and  more  recent  approaches,  and 
to measure their implications. Actually the answer is not so easy because there 

 

6 

are  today  different  conceptions  of  relativity.  We  shall  envisage  successively 
the  most  generally  accepted  conceptions,  Einstein’s  relativity  and  Poincaré’s 
theory. 
 
3.1. Einstein’s relativity [2] 
The answer to our question is easier as regards Einstein’s relativity, since this 
approach does not assume the existence of a preferred aether frame. 
As we have seen, when we deal with two “inertial” systems S1 and S2 receding 
from  the  aether  frame  at  speeds 
  the  extended  space-time 
01v
transformations  for  a  vehicle  moving  at  speed  V  relative  to  the  aether  frame

We  note  that
  in  expressions  (11)  and  (12)  are  not  subjected  to 
measurement  alterations.  Here,  we  can  see  that  there  is  a  formal  similarity 
and  Einstein’s 
between 
transformations although their meaning is quite different. The similarity can be 
extended,  for  example,  to  the  cases  where  the  speed  of  the  moving  bodies 
under consideration is fast relative to the absolute speed of the Earth frame. 
 
3.2. Poincaré’s theory [5] 
Poincaré’s theory assumes the existence of a preferred aether frame and at the 
same  time  that  all  “inertial  frames”  are  equivalent  for  the  description  of  the 

transformations

physical laws. For Poincaré, the relativity principle applies without restrictions 
and, apparently, nothing differentiates the coordinates of the aether frame and 
the co-ordinates of the other frames. Therefore the space-time transformations 
connecting any pair of “inertial frames” take the form:

apparent  co-ordinates,  which  are  derived  from  the  Galilean  co-ordinates  by 
submitting  them  to  the  systematic  measurement  distortions  (due  to  length 
contraction, clock retardation and arbitrary clock synchronization).  
In our approach, the relations (13) and (14) in which x, t and v are the true co-
ordinates,  apply  exclusively  when  the  transformations  connect  the  aether 
frame with any other “inertial” frame. Indeed, from (7) and (8), assuming that 
S1 is at rest in the Cosmic substratum, we have:

These transformations differ from the Lorentz-Poincaré transformations in that 
they  relate  the  apparent  distances  and  times  measured  in  S1  and  S2.  The 
conventional transformations which do not recognize the existence of distorted 
co-ordinates do not apply.

With these variables, the transformations therefore do not constitute a group.

Conclusion 
Although the mathematical form of the equations we have derived is identical 
to  that  of  the  Lorentz-Poincaré  transformations,  their  meaning  is  completely 
different  because  they  relate  distorted  co-ordinates  and  are  dependent  on  an 
arbitrary  synchronization  procedure.  Yet,  these  transformations  are  those 
which  result  from  the  experimental  measurements.  As  we  have  seen  in 
formulas  (15)  and  (16), 
they  can  be  qualified  as  Lorentz-Poincaré 
transformations  only  when  they  connect  the  aether  frame  with  any  other 
“inertial frame”. 
The difference is all the more evident, since these transformations are derived 
from the extended space-time transformations, which assume the variability of 

 

11 

the one-way speed of light when this speed is exactly measured and show that 
the  apparent  invariance  of  the  speed  of  light  results  from  measurement 
distortions. If the synchronization was perfect, the speed of light would prove 
dependent on the relative speed between the fundamental frame and the frame 
where  it  is  measured,  a  fact  which  would  enable  us  to  measure  the  absolute 
speed  of  this  frame  in  contradiction  with  Poincaré’s  relativity  principle  [1]. 
And  a  near  perfect  clock  synchronization  is  not,  a  proiri,  an  objective 
impossible to reach. 
It  is  clear  that,  if  no  preferred  frame  existed,  the  celestial  bodies,  taken  as 
reference  systems,  would  in  all  probability  move  in  an  almost  absolute 
vacuum.  In  this  case,  the  existence  of  near  perfect  inertial  frames  would  be 
possible. Indeed, no physical effect could distinguish one frame from another. 
As a result, the laws of physics, relating exactly measured variables, would be 
identical  in  all  these  reference  frames.  But,  as  we  demonstrated  in  ref  [1],  a 
number  of  experimental  and  theoretical  arguments  lend  support  to  the 
existence of a preferred aether frame. 
A preferred frame can only be conceived if it is distinguished from the others, 
in that a body at rest in it is submitted to distinct physical effects. This implies 
the  existence  of  a  medium,  difficult  to  detect,  but  identifiable  by  its  effects, 
that we refer to as the aether. The magnitude of the interaction of the medium 
with  bodies  at  rest  in  a  certain  “inertial  frame”  must  therefore  vary  as  a 
function  of  the  relative  speed  between  the  frame  considered  and  the  aether 
frame.  As  the  example  of  the  two  rockets  demonstrates,  provided  that  the 
speeds  are  exactly  measured,  the  existence  of  the  preferred  aether  frame 
proves incompatible with the application of the relativity principle. The space-
time  transformations  we  have  derived,  therefore,  conceal  hidden  variables 
which deserved to be disclosed for a deeper understanding of physics.

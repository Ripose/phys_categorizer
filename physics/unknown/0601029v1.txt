We  discover  the  existence  of  vortex  solitons  supported  by  the  surface  between  two 

optical  lattices  imprinted  in  Kerr-type  nonlinear  media.  Such  solitons  can  feature 

strongly noncanonical profiles, and we found that their properties are dictated by the 

location  of  the  vortex  core  relative  to  the  surface.  The  refractive  index  modulation 

forming the lattices at both sides of the interface results in complete stability of the 

vortex  solitons  in  wide  domains  of  their  existence,  thus  introducing  the  first  known 

example of stable topological solitons supported by a surface.

Vortex  solitons,  i.e.  localized  excitations  which  carry  screw  topological  phase 

dislocations  in  nonlinear  materials  play  a  central  role  in  many  branches  of  physics, 

including  superfluids,  plasmas,  Bose-Einstein  condensates,  and  nonlinear  optics  (for 

recent reviews, see, e.g., [1]). Bright vortex solitons are typically prone to azimuthal 

modulation instabilities that cause their self-splitting into ground-state solitons that 

fly off the original state. Only a few examples of stable vortices in uniform materials 

were  found  to  date,  including  vortices  in  media  with  competing  nonlinearities, 

dissipative  systems,  and,  very  recently,  in nonlocal media [2]. Spatial modulation of 

parameters of nonlinear media can have strong stabilizing action on vortices. It was 

shown  in  Ref.  [3]  that  stable  vortices  can  exist  in  discrete  lattices,  e.g.  two-

dimensional  arrays  of  weakly  coupled  waveguides.  This  proposal  was  further 

confirmed  theoretically  for  vortices  in  continuous  lattices  imprinted  in  cubic  and 

saturable  nonlinear  materials  [4].  Lattice  vortex  solitons  have  been  observed  in 

photorefractive crystals [5], where periodic lattices were optically induced [6,7]. Stable

vortex solitons were also found in higher-order spectral bands of periodic lattices [8], 

in  three-dimensional  lattices  [9],  in  Bessel  lattices  [10],  in  materials  with  quadratic 

nonlinearities [11], and in photonic crystals [12]. Vortex solitons can be asymmetric in 

symmetric [13] and in anisotropic lattices [14]. 

A new important possibility, never addressed to date, is the existence of vortex 

solitons  at  the  surface  between  two  different  materials.  Surfaces  can  support  waves 

confined at the very interface, and nonlinear surface waves on various interfaces were 

studied  in  solid-state  physics,  in  nonlinear  and  near-field  optics  (see,  e.g.,  [15-17]). 

Nonlinearity  drastically  alters  refraction  scenario  for  optical  beams  and  results  in 

bistability  and  transition  between  regimes  of  total  internal  reflection  and  complete 

transmission  [18].  Optical  surface  waves  have  been  observed  in  photorefractive 

materials with diffusion nonlinearity [19] and at the interface of uniform and layered 

media,  including  photonic  crystals  [20].  Arrays  of  waveguides  made  with  currently 

available  technologies  allow  formation  of  solitons  at  the  interface  between  optical 

lattices, a landmark concept put forward recently in [21]. 

In  this  Letter  we  discover  the  existence  of  vortex  solitons  at  an  interface  of 

two periodic lattices imprinted in Kerr-type focusing nonlinear media. To the best of 

our knowledge, the existence of surface vortices has not been reported so far, not even 

for  interfaces  of  uniform  materials.  We  found  that  surface  vortex  solitons  feature 

strongly  asymmetric  shapes  and  noncanonical  phase  distributions.  Importantly,  we 

found that the lattices forming the interface results in complete stability of the vortex 

solitons  in  wide  domains  of  their  existence.  Also,  we  reveal  nontrivial  relation 

between interface parameters and existence domains of surface vortex solitons. 

We  consider  propagation  of  laser  radiation  at  the  interface  of  two  periodic 

lattices  imprinted  in  the  focusing  media  with  Kerr-type  saturable  nonlinearity, 

described by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation for dimensionless complex amplitude 

of the light field q :

 are small compared with 

unperturbed  refractive  index  of  material  and  are  of  the  order  of  nonlinear 

contribution  due  to  the  Kerr  effect.  Such  refractive  index  landscapes  can  be  either 

fabricated  (e.g.,  by  ion  implantation),  or  they  might  be  induced  optically  in  the 

photorefractive  crystals.  In  the  latter  case  the  periodic  part  of  the  lattice  might  be 

created  by  interfering  four  plane  waves,  while  nonuniform  incoherent  background 

illumination  of  the  proper  side  of  the  crystal  can  produce  a  sharp  step  in  the 

refractive index at  η

. Standard techniques [6] based on the vectorial interactions 

can  be  implemented  to  observe  soliton  propagation  in  optically  induced  refractive 

index  profile,  that  can  be  fine-tuned  by  intensities  of  lattice-creating  waves  and 

background  illumination.  It  should  be  pointed  out  that  other  types  of  nonlinear 

lattice interfaces could potentially be realized in the photorefractive crystals, e.g. by 

applying different voltages to the different crystal parts. Equation (1) admits several

Upon  searching  for  various  vortex  soliton  profiles  we  solved  system  (2)  numerically 

with a standard relaxation method. It is apparent that very far from interface located 

at 

η =

0

 the properties of vortex solitons supported by lattice, shown in Fig. 1(c), do 

not differ substantially from the properties of their counterparts in perfectly periodic 

lattices, but situation changes dramatically as soon as soliton energy concentrates in 

lattice periods adjacent to the interface. In this case the internal structure is different

for vortices shifted into lattice regions with lower (at  η

0<

) or higher (

η >

0

) mean 

refractive index values. The simplest situation occurs when vortex phase singularity 

is located close to the point 

η

ζ= =

0

. Representative examples of profiles of such 

vortices are depicted in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). By analogy with perfectly periodic lattice 

we term such vortices “off-site” since phase singularity is located between local lattice 

maxima. Four main intensity lobes (whose separation is minimal for off-site case) are 

clearly resolvable in vortex profile, but two of them located at 

η >

0

 are smaller than 

those located at  η

0<

, so that vortex become strongly asymmetric, especially for big 

refractive index steps  δ . The phase distributions for asymmetric surface vortices are 

p

noncanonical  [22],  i.e.  on  a  ring  of  radius  r   whose  center  coincides  with  phase 

singularity, phase does not grow linearly, but rather possesses alternating regions of 

slow (in the vicinity of local intensity maxima) and fast growth. While increasing  δ  

p

results in stronger asymmetry, the growth of the periodic modulation depth 

p

 leads 

to stronger localization of vortex energy near local lattice maxima. 

 

We found that at fixed  δ  and 

p

p

 there exist lower b

 and upper b

 cutoffs

for existence of off-site surface vortices. In contrast to canonical vortices in uniform 

media the ratio U

 is not constant and varies

quantities U  abruptly tends to zero. The domain of existence for surface vortices is 

r,i

presented in Fig. 2(a). The width of existence domain in  b  is maximal (though still 

limited)  for  δ

p

0→

,  and  quickly  shrinks  with  increase  of  δ , so that above certain 

p

critical  value 

δ

crp

  of  step  in  the  constant  part  of  refractive  index  off-site  surface 

vortices  do  not  exist  at  the  lattice  interface.  For  a  fixed  δ   the  width  of  existence 

p

domain  gets  broader  with  decrease  of  the  lattice  depth 

p

.  Though  dependencies 

)b

  are  nonmonotonic  close  to  cutoffs,  the  total  energy  flow  U   still  is  a 

r,i(U
monotonically increasing function of propagation constant (Fig. 2(b)). The maximal 

energy  flow  carried  by  the  vortex  soliton  residing  at  the  interface  quickly  decreases 

with increase of 

pδ

. We found that close to lower cutoff surface vortices are typically 

less localized than their counterparts near upper cutoff. This is especially pronounced 

at  small  and  moderate  values  of 

pδ ∼

1

,  when  low-energy  vortices  expand  over 

several neighboring lattice maximums, moreover, the expansion in the region 

η

0>

 

can  be  much  more  pronounced  than  that  for  η

0<

.  Vortices  with  strongly 

asymmetric shapes at  δ

p (cid:21)

1

 are typically well localized in both cutoffs. The striking 

feature of surface vortices is that critical value of refractive index step 

crpδ

 decreases 

 

4

with  increase  of  the  lattice  depth  (Fig.  2(c)),  i.e.  stronger  asymmetries  can  only  be 

achieved at interfaces formed by shallower lattices. 

 

One of the central results of this Letter is that strongly asymmetric vortices at 

interface of two lattices can be made completely stable in the substantial part of their 

existence domain. To analyze stability of surface vortex solitons, we searched for the 

perturbed  solutions  of  Eq.  (1)  in  the  form  q

find the perturbation profiles and associated growth rates  δ . The outcome of stability 

analysis for off-site surface vortices performed for various sets of parameters  δ  and 

p

p

 is summarized in Fig. 3. It was found that such strongly asymmetric vortices are 

stable in the most part of their existence domain at moderate 

p ∼

1

 and high depths 

of periodic modulation. There are two instability domains located near the lower and 

upper cutoffs (Fig. 3(c)). The instability domain near upper cutoff is too narrow and 

not even visible in the plot. The width of the lower instability domain decreases with 

growth  of  δ .  The  instabilities  encountered  for  the  asymmetric  surface  vortices  are 

p

associated with complex growth rates and, hence, are of oscillatory type. The typical 

dependencies of real part of perturbation growth rate on b  are depicted in Figs. 3(a) 

and  3(b).  Notice,  that  increase  of  the  depth 

p

  of  periodic  modulation  results  in 

further reduction of the widths of lower and upper instability domains. 

 

To confirm the results of the linear stability analysis we solved Eq. (1) directly 

with  the  input  conditions

.  The  results  obtained

noise

confirmed  the  conclusions  drawn  from  the  linear  stability  analysis  in  all  cases. 

Asymmetric surface vortices belonging to stability domain retain their input structure 

for  huge  distances,  far  exceeding  experimentally  achievable  crystal  lengths  (see  Fig. 

 

 

 

 

5

4(a)), while unstable representatives of off-site vortex families decay via progressively 

growing oscillations of their intensity lobes (Fig. 4(b)). 

 

In  addition,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that  besides  simplest  off-site  surface 

vortices  we  found  a  variety  of  other  asymmetric  vortex  solitons  families.  Most 

representative  examples  of  on-site  vortices  that  reside  mainly  at  the  left  or  at  the 

right of the interface are shown in Figs. 1(d) – 1(f) (notice, that upon searching for 

such  vortices  we  translated  the  lattice  by  π

/ Ω

  in  the  vertical  direction  for 

convenience). We found that on-site vortices are much more sensitive to variation in 

the  height  of  refractive  index  step  δ   and  typically  require  δ

p

p

p<
,

  so  that  the 

existence  domain  substantially  departs  from  that  for  their  off-site  counterparts. 

Nevertheless,  on-site  vortices  also  feature  strongly  asymmetric  shapes  (see,  e.g.  Fig. 

1(e)),  and  can  be  made  completely  stable  in  certain  domains  of  their  existence. 

Finally,  we  would  like  to  remark  that  we  also  found  that  lattices  with  defocusing 

nonlinearity also can support asymmetric vortex solitons. 

 

We  thus  conclude  stressing  that  we  have  reported,  for  the  first  time  to  our 

knowledge,  the  existence  of  surface  vortex  solitons.  We  found  that  such  vortex 

solitons exist only when the refractive index at the surface does not exceed a critical 

value, dictated by the depth of the lattices, they are stable and robust under proper 

conditions,  and  they  feature  strongly  asymmetric and noncanonical nature. Here we 

addressed  the  interface  between  two  distinct  periodic  lattices  with  focusing 

nonlinearity,  but  results  have  implications  for  other  physical  settings.  Also,  we 

believe  that  our  findings  reported  here  motivate  the  search  for  general  topological 

solitons supported by surfaces.

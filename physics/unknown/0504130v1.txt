I. Foreword: Sponsor’s View of the Importance of This Work 
 
   By Dr. Paul J. Werbos, NSF, pwerbos@nsf.gov 
 
The lab-scale tests reported here appear to represent an essential breakthrough in the 
global effort to protect energy security and reduce CO2 emissions soon enough to matter. 
Of course, these tests are only a beginning. In a rational world, we would immediately 
organize and fund new efforts to maximize the probability that this technology actually 
reaches the mass market for automobiles, at the soonest possible time, on a competitive 
free-market basis. By replacing the small internal combustion engine in advanced hybrid 
cars like the Toyota Harrier with this kind of fuel cell, we could hope to raise the 
efficiency of that part of the system from something like 30 percent or more to something 
like 60 percent or more, and vastly improve overall fuel use and emissions.  
This paper was submitted as the final report to a Small Grant for Exploratory 
 
Research (SGER), Number ECS-0342586, funded through myself and Dr. James A. 
Momoh of the Electrical and Communication Systems (ECS) Division of NSF. The 
authors have given me permission to make this report public. The views in this foreword 
are my own personal views, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the authors or the 
official views of NSF. Likewise, the paper itself does not necessarily reflect the official

or with reformed methanol and air, as the authors stress. However, Momoh and I have 
become more and more worried about the rapid growth in world dependence on oil from 
the Middle East, compared with the very very slow progress in transition to a truly pure 
hydrogen economy. The leaders of the US clearly agree that the problems involving oil 
and violence in the Middle East today demand the highest possible level of attention and 
effort, as does the spread of nuclear technology (even as associated with nuclear power 
plants) in the developing world. Rising gasoline prices are already high on the list of 
issues which concern the US public – and their fears about fuel supply have already cut 
deeply into revenues from the sale of cars and trucks. Yet when we look 20 to 40 years 
into the future, these problems appear to be on a path to becoming ten times as serious as 
they are today. They may even combine in a way that threatens our very survival.  There 
is no certain way to reverse these trends, but Momoh and I believe that new 
breakthroughs in technology – like the one reported here – do offer serious hope of 
reversing the trends within 20 to 40 years (hopefully 20!) if we follow up as hard as we 

The carbon-tolerant alkaline fuel cell could be used either with hydrogen and air,

Crudely speaking, most energy policy work (like the development of the Kyoto 

As part of that larger question, we may ask: how can we minimize the expected

may well be one of the essential steps on the path.

Treaty or the current Energy Bill) has focused on the question: what can we do now, that 
we are totally sure of, that can give immediate results in reducing oil dependency or 
emissions? However, the best that we can do now – as reflected in the Kyoto Treaty itself 
– adds up to something much smaller than the size of the problem. A 15% reduction does 
not change much. Conversely, others have asked how we can envision the perfectly CO2-
free renewable sustainable society of the future. For some researchers, this has led to a 
vision of a pure hydrogen economy, although there are other alternatives for a sustainable 
future. (Again, see our slides.) Momoh and I have focused on a third question: how can 
we minimize the expected delay between now and the time when we reduce oil 
dependency or CO2 emissions by a large enough factor to save us (a factor of three or 
four or more)? That is the basis for the energy strategy we have presented through IEEE-
USA. 
 
delay between now and the time when millions of consumers buy these new fuel cell 
cars? Certainly we have to work on the technology itself, and hedge our bets with regard 
to the risks involved.  But that is not enough. We do not expect that people will buy huge 
numbers of fuel cell cars until and unless the fuel for these cars is available in 10-20% of 
the gas stations in the region of the US where they live. (This estimate of 10-20% comes 
from studies reported by Roberta Nichols of Ford and others.) Thus to reach our goal for 
these cars, we must both develop the technology and reach this threshold of fuel 
availability, as soon as possible. 
 
Congress (or other regions?) could pass a fuel competition law, requiring that any new 
car which can use gasoline must also be able to use ethanol or methanol, starting 2-4 
years from now. This kind of retooling would be relatively inexpensive, because fuel 
flexibility is a well-established technology. (Also, there are some new technologies which 
can reduce the cost of flexibility.) Such a law would unleash the power of market 
competition between these fuels and between the many sources of such fuels. Methanol, 
in particular, can be made economically from remote natural gas, from “Clean Coal,” and 
from biological sources. Based on current technology, there is good reason to believe that 
the free market would supply enough methanol to solve our “chicken and egg” problem 
at the soonest possible time, without subsidies. Auto companies would benefit, on 
balance, because reduced insecurity about fuel would have a bigger effect on car sales 
than the small market-wide effect on the cost of making cars. Oil companies would 
benefit, because their proved reserves of car fuel would suddenly be enlarged by their 
methanol production capacity, which they could expand relatively quickly. Again, see the 
slides and citations in the slides for more analysis. 
 
carrier. But this idea has not worked out very well, for fundamental thermodynamic 
reasons, and DOE has recently cancelled research efforts to try to process gasoline to 
hydrogen on-board a car. By contrast, methanol is an excellent hydrogen carrier, and 

In the past, some have argued that we should use gasoline itself as a hydrogen 

In my view, the fastest way to do this is by focusing on the methanol option. 

small-scale efficient steam reformers for methanol have been around for decades. When 
intelligent control is used to integrate such reformers into a larger fuel cell system in an 
optimal way, the overall system may actually be more efficient than a hydrogen-carrying 
fuel cell car, if we account for losses in hydrogen storage systems. Nevertheless, this also 
requires a greater development and use of the kind of intelligent control which really does 
provide optimization over time in noisy, nonlinear systems; see the Handbook of 
Learning and Approximate Dynamic Programming, Si et al eds, IEEE Press/Wiley, 2004, 
for more information. It is interesting to consider how that new technology might also be 
attempted for enhanced oil recovery or hydrate extraction. 
 
but they are not enough by themselves to do the whole job. See the slides for other 
aspects.

Chapter 1. Introduction  

There  is  considerable  interest  in  the  U.S.  in  becoming  a  hydrocarbon-independent 
society.  The reasons include: minimizing the production of contaminants to protect the 
environment,  moving  to  non-OPEC-controlled  alternate  energy  sources,  becoming  less 
dependent on foreign sources of energy (oil), and shifting our dependence to “in house” 
resources such as gas. 

As  cited  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC,  Houghton,  et  al., 
1996), “From the point of view of global warming, CO2 is certainly a threat.”  Although 
CO2  is  the  most  important  greenhouse  gas  and  is  the  largest  emission,  the  greenhouse 
effect is a combination of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions.  The capacity of CH4 and N2O 
to  contribute  to  the  warming  of  the  atmosphere  is  21  and  310  times  higher  than  CO2, 
respectively.   

The exploration of alternate energy sources is the object of increased research.  Among 
the most popular new energy sources are hydrogen and methanol.  Hydrogen production 
may  be  cheaper  than  methanol,  but  both  cost  about  the  same  to  deliver.    However, 
hydrogen is more expensive to store than methanol. 

The term “pollution free”  is  closely  related to the fuel used by the  fuel cell.   The most 
common  “pollution  free”  fuel  used  is  hydrogen.    Among  the  “pollution  free”  or  “zero 
emission”  fuel  cells,  the  largest  research  funding  has  been  invested  in  solving  the 
scientific  and  engineering  problems  that  impede  the  wide  implementation  of  PEMFC 
technologies.    These  problems  can  be  summarized  as:  (a)  designing  and  producing 
electrode  structures  that  can  produce  useful  power  under  near  ambient  conditions  with 
minimal  catalyst  loading  or  with  cheap  catalysts,  and  (b)  immunity  inhibition  of  the 
anodic electrochemical reactions due to minor contaminants in the fuel stream (e.g., CO, 
H2S). 

Hydrogen Fuel 

It  is  important  to  clarify  that  the  “emission  free”  H2-based  fuel  cells  will  not  produce 
CO2, nor SOx or NxO, emissions where the hydrogen fuel cells are operated.  However, 
hydrogen  molecules  (H2)  do  not  exist  in  abundance  as  a  pure  molecule  on  earth.  
Therefore,  hydrogen  must  be  produced  other  ways:  from  hydrocarbons,  photosynthetic 
purple  non-sulphur  bacteria,  water  pyrolisis,  steam  reforming,  hydrocarbon  partial 
oxidation, or by using different sources of energy, such as plasma or nuclear sources, to 
electrolyze or decompose water.  For example, hydrogen is now made from natural gas 
(methane),  petroleum,  coal,  various  chemical  reactions,  and  biomass  (landfill  waste, 
wastewater  sludge,  and  livestock  waste).    When  hydrogen  is  produced  from  methane 
(CH4), CO2 and CH4 are emitted into the air.  Although the amount of CH4 emissions is 
considerably less than the CO2 emissions on a weight basis (10.621 kg of CO2/kg-of-H2-
produced versus 0.060 kg of CH4/kg-of-H2-produced), the CH4 has a 21 times higher heat 
capability than CO2.  CH4 emissions from H2 production account for 10.6% of the total 
greenhouse effect.

Not all methods for producing H2 are damaging to the environment.  This is usually true 
if the hydrogen comes from hydrocarbons.  However, until now there was not an existing 
economically  viable  method  to  cleanly  and  economically  produce  large  volumes  of  H2.  
Accordingly,  by  now,  H2/O2  fuel  cells  will  not  have  an  overall  effect  of  reducing  the 
greenhouse effect or soon becoming economically attractive. 

Methanol Fuel 

The  United  States  provides  almost  one  quarter  of  the  world’s  supply  of  methanol.    “In 
2001,  methanol  production  capacity  from  U.S.  plants  totaled  over  1.5  billion  gallons” 
(Methanol Institute and the Methanex Corporation).  U.S. plants meet about one-half of 
the  U.S.  methanol  demand,  with  the  remaining  supply  imported  from  Trinidad,  Chile, 
Venezuela, and Canada.   

The  largest  market  in  the  U.S.  for  methanol  is  the  production  of  methyl  tertiary  butyl 
ether, or MTBE.  Over 3 million tons of methanol, or 35% of methanol consumed in the 
U.S.,  goes  into  the  creation  of  MTBE.    MTBE  is  blended  in  clean,  reformulated  and 
oxygenated  gasoline,  serving  one-third  of  the  U.S.  gasoline  market.    Accordingly,  the 
need to fabricate MTBE would be considerable reduced if methanol were used as a fuel 
instead of gasoline.   

Methanol  can  be  produced  from  either  hydrocarbons  or  organic  material  fermentation.  
While  production  through  hydrocarbons  does  not  lead  to  a  hydrocarbon  independent 
society or an environmentally friendly society, organic material fermentation does.  The 
CO2  produced 
through  organic  material  fermentation  would  be  current  CO2 
contamination  and  not  “fossil”  contamination.    Trees  naturally  produce  CO2.    Cutting 
trees  to  transform  them  into  fuel  would  produce  the  same  amount  of  CO2  that  the  tree 
would produce were it to remain alive.  We call this “present contamination” as it does 
not represent a threat to nature.  On the other hand, oil represents “fossil” production of 
CO2 and release of that “fossil” CO2 in present time greatly impacts the environment. 

Fuel Cells-A Short Review 

Several types of Fuel Cells have been developed throughout the years.  The original one 
was an Alkaline Fuel Cells (AFC), followed by the Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) and 
the  Proton  Exchange  Membrane  Fuel  Cells  (PEMFCs).    The  name  of  the  fuel  cell  is 
usually  originated  by  the  type  of  electrolyte  used.    The  cells,  in  general,  have  some 
similar features: (a) the electrodes are mostly porous gas diffusion electrodes, (b) a metal 
catalyst (Ni, Pt) is needed at the electrode’s site, (c) the oxygen and fuel reactions happen 
at the electrodes, and (d) the catalysts have to be in contact with both the electronic and 
ionic (electrolyte) conductors.  The fuel is oxidized at the anode site while the oxygen is 
reduced at the cathode site.

H2-Fuel cells (PEMFC and AFC) 

Alkaline  fuel  cells  (AFC)  are  an  attractive,  non-conventional  source  of  energy.    AFC 
offer  several  advantages  over  the  more  commonly  used  and  researched  PEMFC.    The 
kinetics  of  the  electrode  reactions  are  superior  in  an  alkaline  environment  (AFC) 
compared  to  acidic  environment  (PEMFC)  [1-4].    The  inherently  faster  kinetics  of  the 
reactions in an alkaline fuel cell allows the use of non-noble, metal, electro-catalysts, like 
nickel,  silver  etc.  [5-8].    AFCs  also  exhibit  much  higher  current  densities  and 
electrochemical  efficiencies  at  comparable  temperatures  over  PEMFC.    In  addition,  the 
liquid  KOH  electrolyte  used  in  AFCs  is  much  cheaper  than  the  polymer  electrolyte 
(Nafion)  used  in  PEMFCs,  which  needs  constant  humidification  for  proper  functioning 
[9-11].  Water management is also not a major issue with AFCs as with PEMFCs, thus 
allowing  simplicity  in  design  and  fabrication.    AFCs  can  be  operated  at  a  higher 
temperature  (100°C  -120°C),  thereby  using  the  Arrhenius  effect  to  the  advantage  and, 
hence,  obtaining  higher  efficiencies.    PEMFCs  cannot  be  operated  above  90°C  due  to 
problems  with  the  hydration  of  the  nafion  membrane.    Moreover,  AFC  electrodes  are 
stable and not prone to the poisoning caused by carbon monoxide (CO) which poisons the 
platinum catalyst of the PEMFCs [12].  Therefore, considering the cost and the simplicity 
of  operation,  AFCs  are  more  advantageous  as  compared  to  PEMFCs  and  have  better 
prospects in the commercialization of fuel cells. 

The  reactions  that  take  place  at  the  electrodes  when  H2  is  used  as  a  fuel  can  be 
summarized as follows: 

O2 (g) + 2H2O (l) + 4e- (cid:217) 4OH- (aq)    E˚ = 0.40 V 

Cathode:  

Anode:  

H2 (g) + 2OH- (aq) (cid:217) 2H2O (l)  + 2e-    E˚ = 0.83 V   

The  by-product  water  and  heat  have  to  be  removed.    This  is  usually  achieved  by  re-
circulating the electrolyte and using it as the coolant liquid.  

Table  1.1  shows  a  comparison  in  cost  and  performance  between  AFCs  and  PEMFCs, 
without  considering  the  government  and  industry  research  investments.    Two  main 
attractions  that  the  AFC  presents  over  the  PEMFC  are  low  cost  and  robustness  of  the 
anode to poisoning by impurities.

Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC) 

These  cells  are  similar  to  the  PEM  cells  in  the  sense  that  they  both  use  a  polymer 
membrane  as  the  electrolyte.    However,  in  DMFCs  the  fuel  used  for  oxidation  at  the 
anode is methanol instead of hydrogen.  Efficiencies of about 40% are expected with this 
type of fuel cell, which would typically operate at a temperature between 50-100°C.  This 
is a relatively low temperature range, making this fuel cell attractive for tiny to mid-sized 
applications,  such  as  powering  cellular  phones  and  laptops.    Higher  efficiencies  are 
achieved at higher temperatures.  This type of cell produces CO2 as a sub-product. 

DMFC’s main drawbacks are 1) its high cost due to the expensive catalyst used because 
they operate in an acidic medium, 2) it is bulky due to the external recirculation pumps 
and  3)  it  has  a  low  efficiency  when  compared  to  thermal  engines.    Figure  1.1  shows  a 
schematic representation of this type of fuel cell. 

The reactions that take place at the electrodes can be summarized as follows:

Alkaline Fuel Cells fueled with Methanol 

Alkaline  fuel  cells  use  fuel,  an  oxidant  and  a  liquid  alkaline  electrolyte,  usually  KOH 
mixed  with  water.    When  methanol  is  used  as  the  fuel  instead  of  hydrogen,  the  cell 
becomes an alkaline fuel cell fueled with methanol.  The overall reactions are similar to 
DMFCs. 

This type of cell inherits some of the advantages and disadvantage of the hydrogen fueled 
alkaline fuel cells and the direct methanol fuel cells.  For example, some disadvantages 
might  be  cross  over  problems  similar  to  DMFCs,  being  heavier  and  bulkier  than 
PEMFCs,  having  lower  power  densities  than  PEMFCs  or  AFCs  fueled  with  H2.    An 
advantage might be operating with cheaper catalysts than DMFCs or PEMFCs. 

The  most  important  issue  to  study  in  this  cell  is  the  CO2  poisoning  of  the  alkaline 
electrolyte.    That  study  may  be  completely  focused  on  the  methanol  oxidation  in  an 
alkaline  media.    Over  the  past  few  years  there  has  been  a  resurgence  of  interest  in 
methanol  oxidation.    The  recent  literature  concerns  the  adsorption  and  oxidation 
processes occurring at the catalyst surface.   

Issues in Fuel Cells (PEMFCs and AFCs) 

PEMFC:  In general, the H2/O2 reactions in the fuel cells call for large electrode areas, 
high  temperatures,  and  expensive  catalysts  when  acidic  media  is  used  (polymer 
membranes).  The more acidic the electrolyte and the closer to room temperature the fuel 
cell  operates,  the  stronger  the  need  to  use  an  expensive  catalyst  (example  platinum, 
ruthenium) and a highly pure hydrogen fuel and oxygen. 

 

6

The main problem with PEMFCs is the need to work with very expensive, hard to find 
catalysts  in  order  to  increase  their  efficiency.    Those  catalysts  are  also  easily  poisoned 
with  minor  elements  that  contaminate  the  fuel  or  the  oxidant.    Moreover  the  polymer 
conducting  membrane,  i.e.  nafion,  is  very  expensive  and  is  hard  to  work  with  and 
engineer. The polymeric membrane requires highly controlled conditions in temperature 
and  humidity  for  optimum  performance.  Also,  PEMFCs  cannot  operate  at  temperatures 
greater than 80°C due to dehydration of the nafion membrane. 

AFC: AFCs are inherently plagued by the problem of carbon dioxide poisoning, which 
limits  their  use  as  air-breathing  energy  sources.    The  poisoning  reaction  depletes  the 
alkaline KOH electrolyte directly by the following reaction [10-12]: 

CO2+ 2KOH (aq.) (cid:198) K2CO3 (aq.) +H2O 

This  reaction  has  the  effect  of  reducing  the  number  of  hydroxyl  ions  available  for 
reaction at the electrodes.  This conversion from hydroxide to carbonate also reduces the 
ionic conductivity of the electrolyte solution.  In a very concentrated electrolyte solution, 
it may also have the effect of blocking the pores of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) by the 
precipitation of K2CO3 salt [14].  However, Gülzow et al. reported that, although carbon 
dioxide poisoning decreases an AFC performance, it does not cause any degradation of 
the electrodes [15].  Even after thousands of hours of operation in a carbon dioxide rich 
atmosphere, no additional electrode degradation, like deposition of K2CO3, was observed.  
Al Saleh et al. also showed the similar affect of carbon dioxide on a fuel cell performance 
[16].    It  was  observed  that  concentrations  of  up  to  1%  carbon  dioxide  in  the  oxidant 
stream  of  Ag/PTFE  electrodes  did  not  affect  the  cell  performance  over  a  period  of  200 
hours. 

Therefore,  the  most  probable  reason  for  the  decrease  in  the  cell  performance  is  the 
change in electrolyte composition.  Conversion of the electrolyte, from KOH to K2CO3, 
by the absorption of carbon dioxide slows down the rate of oxidation of fuel at the anode 
[17-18].  The sluggish anode kinetics decreases the performance of a fuel cell as a whole 
unless the electrolyte is being circulated continuously. In addition, decreased electrolyte 
conductivity  also  increases  the  ohmic  polarization  leading  to  lower  cell  efficiency.  
Although  the  harmful  effects  of  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  can  be  partly  reduced  by 
circulating  the  electrolyte  as  discussed  by  Cifrain  et  al.  [19],  a  permanent  solution  is 
sought after to increase the possibility of AFC commercialization.  

A  lot  of  effort  is  being  made  to  rectify  the  problem  of  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  in 
alkaline fuel cells.  Molecular sieves and polymeric membranes are being developed (see 
NIST, NSF, Air Products, etc.) and discussed for CO2 separation from air [20].  However, 
at the present time, those membranes require large areas of the sieves or membranes and 
low gas velocity to remove CO2 to ~10ppm.  

Another  alternative  proposed  in  the  literature  is  CO2  management,  which  involves  the 
synergistic possibility of using liquid hydrogen to condense the carbon dioxide out of the 
air.  Ahuja and Green [21, 22] discussed this at length and developed a model of the heat 

 

7

exchanger required for this.  This solution presents low parasitic energy consumption, but 
the condensation and re-vaporization of water and CO2 makes the structure complicated.  
Fyke  [23]  discussed  the  possibility  of  using  a  solid  ionomer  alkaline  membrane  that 
would enable a cell to run without  the  possibility  of  carbon dioxide poisoning,  as  there 
would be no free potassium cations to which the carbonate anions could attach.  This is 
an  intriguing  concept  but  no  progress  in  solid  ionomer  alkaline  membranes  have  been 
reported since Swette et al. [24] discussed this possibility for regenerative fuel cells.  

Kordesch  and  Gunter  [25]  mentioned  that  the  "Removal  of  the  0.03%  carbon  dioxide 
from  the  air  can  be  accomplished  by  chemical  absorption  in  a  tower  filled  with  “soda 
lime".  One kilogram of soda lime has the ability to clean 1000 m3 of air from 0.03% to 
0.001% CO2.  The only method commercially-employed, at the moment, to alleviate the 
oxidant  side  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  is  CO2  scrubbing  using  soda  lime.    Technically, 
this system works, but is not a strong candidate for commercial systems.  This suggests 
that  significant  benefits  could  be  obtained  from  the  use  of  other  scrubbing  techniques.  
However,  among  the  present  CO2  removal  methods,  the  soda  lime  CO2  scrubber  is  the 
only  practical  solution  for  removing  CO2  from  the  cathode  air  stream,  but  it  is 
cumbersome  due  to  the  periodic  maintenance  and  operational  costs  over  the  lifetime  of 
the  fuel  cells.    This  may  not  be  suitable  for  high  power  applications,  as  it  will  require 
frequent  replacement.    One  can  also  reduce  the  carbonate  poisoning  problem  by 
recirculation of the electrolyte [26]. 

Another  possible  remedy  of  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  is  the  use  of  a  three-phased 
fluidized electrode. This electrode has a completely different structure compared with a 
conventional porous gas-diffusion electrode.  It increases the CO2 tolerance of a fuel cell 
by  eliminating  the  structure  of  the  porous  gas  diffusion  electrode.    Also,  this  electrode 
can  increase  limiting  current  density  and  decrease  concentration  polarization  due  to  its 
large  electrode  area  and  high  rates  of  mass  transfer  to  the  surface  of  the  electrode 
particles by the gas bubbling and flow of electrolyte.  However, the research results are 
not  impressive,  mainly  due  to  the  poor  contact  between  the  current  collector  and  the 
electrode particles.  

CO2 Poisoning of AFC  

The electrolyte composition changes when CO2 is carried along with the oxygen through 
the air cathode. The CO2 dissolves in water.

The solubility of CO2 = 0.76 lt/lt-of-H2O at 25°C and 1 atmosphere CO2 or 0.76/24.5 = 
0.031 mole/liter; where 24.5 liter = volume occupied by gas at 25°C and 1 atmosphere.  
The dissolved CO2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid.

The H2CO3 undergoes slight dissociation.  H2CO3 dissociates stepwise:

If an alkaline solution is prepared by adding KOH to the water, H2CO3 and KOH reacts 
and comes in equilibrium with K2CO3 and water, as follows:  

H2CO3 + KOH (cid:217)K2CO3 + 2H2O  

 

If pH increases, the reaction shifts to the right; while pH decreases, the reaction shifts to 
the left.  K2CO3 can be presented as a salt or a solution in the electrolyte (dissociated).

The  equilibrium  between  the  ions  in  the  solution  is  dictated  by  pH  and  temperature.  
Reaction R2 tends to drive the potential to more acidic pHs, while reaction R5 tends to 
drive  the  pH  to  basic  pHs.    If  the  pH  decreases,  reactions  R4  and  R5  shift  to  the  left, 
increasing the concentration of H2CO3 (reaction R5).  If the pH increases, reaction R8 is 
2- increases.  Figure 1.2 shows a balance 
driven to the left and the concentration of CO3
between the H2CO3, HCO3

-, and CO3

2-. 

Accordingly,  when  KOH  is  dissolved  in  water  to  form  an  alkaline  electrolyte  and 
methanol is add to the electrolyte to be used as a fuel, if CO2 comes in contact with the 
electrolyte, potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is formed and the precipitation of the potassium 
in the cells will depend on the relative concentrations of the electrolyte composition (the

water,  the  methanol  and  the  formed  potassium  carbonate)  that  dictates  the  pH  and  the 
temperature.    From  reactions  R1,  R2,  and  R7,  it  is  evident  that  the  concentration  of 
H2CO3  (R2)  is  very  important  to  determine  the  concentration  of  K2CO3.    We  can 
immediately  say,  by  looking  at  Figure  1.2,  that  H2CO3  is  the  dominant  species  in  all 
-  is  dominant  in  the  pH  range  6.4-10.3,  and 
solutions  with  pH  <  6.4  or  H+  >  6.4,  HCO3
2-  is  dominant  at  a  pH  above  10.3.    From  the  figure,  we  can  conclude  that  if  the 
CO3
concentration  of  KOH  increases  (higher  pH),  the  K2CO3  will  increase  (Reaction  7  will 
shift to the right).

If one or more of the new compounds is insoluble, it will precipitate out of the solution 
and the reaction will go spontaneously.  You need to know the solubility rules for various 
ions so you can predict which reactions will occur and which ones will not. 

CO2 Poisoning of AFC Methanol fuelled 

Keep in mind that the ability of the electrolyte to dissolve CO2 and form K2CO2 depends 
on  the  KOH  concentration  in  the  electrolyte.    Figure  1.3  shows  the  triangle  phase 
equilibrium  between  K2CO3,  methanol,  and  water.    Each  vertex  corresponds  to  a  pure 
substance.  The substance at the vertex of the triangle concentration reads at the left of 
the arrow and in the direction of the arrow from 0 to 1 or 0 to 100%.  The side opposite to 
a vertex corresponds to a mixture of the other two substances.   

 

10

 

Figure 1.3:  Tr-phase diagram for a mixture of water, methanol and K2CO3 (which it is formed when the 

KOH electrolyte becomes contaminated with CO2.  

If A, B, and C are the vertices, the mole fraction of A is proportional to the distance from 
the opposite side and the 3 mole fractions add to 1.  It clearly indicates in what region to 
operate and where there will not be salt precipitation or formation.  It is clear that the area 
of interest in order of not having salt precipitating in the membranes pores for a fuel cell 
application is a mixture of the electrolyte from 0.65 up to 1 fraction mole of water, and 
from 0 to 0.45 of methanol depending on the mole fraction of K2CO3 as indicated in the 
phase  diagram  below.    That  “area”  of  interest  is  placed  from  the  top  right  side  of  the 
triangle.   

The  phase  diagram  clearly  delineates  the  areas’  mixtures  for  which  no  precipitation  of 
salt  will  occur  and  the  possibility  of  blocking  the  electrodes  is  minimal.    However,  in 
those areas for which the mixture remains liquid, the unbalance of the OH- concentration 
(changes in pH) may have a detrimental effect on the catalyst action. 

The  phase  diagram  and  the  reactions  indicated  above  gives  us  a  general  idea  of  under 
which  conditions  the  cell’s  membrane  may  be  blocked  by  potassium  carbonate 
precipitating on the pores.  However, as we investigate, it appears that the precipitation of 
potassium carbonate is not the most important problem plaguing the loss of efficiency on 
the alkaline fuel cells when the electrolyte is being CO2 contaminated. 

After reviewing the general problems that plague the fuel cells and the historic remedies 
that have been attempted to remediate those problems, we conclude that none of the cells 
named  above  (PEMFC,  AFC,  DMFC)  have  demonstrated  successful  stable  operation  if 
air  is  used  instead  of  pure  oxygen.    The  problem  is  due  to  the  contaminants  that  come 
with air and with the CO2 presence for AFCs.  The use of pure oxygen is too costly to 
consider.  Also, none of the cells named above have demonstrated successful and stable 
operation  if  they  use  “dirty”  H2  as  fuel  (i.e.  contaminated  with  CO2  or  others 
contaminants).    An  interesting  proposition  will  be  that  of  moving  to  use  air  instead  of 
pure  oxygen,  and  “dirty”  hydrogen  instead  of  hydrogen.    We  focused  our  research  in 
extending the life of alkaline fuel cells due to electrolyte CO2 poisoning to come up with 
a  simple  methodology  that  permits  engineers  to  quantify  the  cell  poisoning  and  take 

 

11

measures (as changing the electrolyte) needed to extend the cell’s life and to increase the 
understanding of the fundamental problems that cause the CO2 poisoning in AFCs. 

Objective: 

 (A).  We propose to study the CO2 poisoning problem on alkaline fuel cells (AFC) by 
means of a membrane that preferentially lets O2 pass over CO2 when air instead of pure 
O2  is  used  at  the  cathode  side.    Metal  chelates  will  be  used  for  selective  transport  of 
oxygen (O2) from air to the oxygen-catalyst/electrolyte surface.   

To  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  cathode  side  of  the  fuel  cell  and  making  the 
experimental procedures easier to handle, we adopted methanol as a fuel instead of H2.   

 (B)  For contaminate fuel as “dirty” H2, we will use a polymeric membrane for which the 
pores size is chosen to maximize the mixture gas separation between the H2 and the CO2. 

To study the effect of “dirty” hydrogen on the anode side of the AFC, we will use an AFC 
fueled with hydrogen and evaluate the effect of CO2 on the cell performance.

Chapter 2.  Membranes for Gas Separation Introduction 

One  way  of  reducing/eliminating  the  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  problem  is  to  prevent 
carbon dioxide from entering the electrolyte.  When “dirty” hydrogen (a mixture of CO2 
and  H2)  is  considered  as  a  fuel,  the  hydrogen  molecules  are  considerable  smaller  than 
CO2 molecules and they should be easier to separate if a membrane with the correct pore 
diameter  is  chosen.    On  the  other  hand,  when  air  instead  of  pure  oxygen  is  used  as  an 
oxidant,  the  molecules  of  CO2  and  O2  are  similar  in  size  and  it  is  difficult  to  separate 
them  using  a  size  selective  membrane.    However,  one  can  increase  the  permeance  of 
oxygen  across  by  chemically  modifying  a  membrane,  i.e.  by  using  chemical  selectivity 
over size selectivity. 

A membrane which is selectively permeable to oxygen and hydrogen and has the ability 
to  limit/stop  the  passage  of  carbon  dioxide  could,  in  principle,  eliminate  the  carbon 
dioxide  poisoning  effect.    Several  types  of  membranes  can  potentially  be  used  for  gas 
separations.  These include the following 

•  Polymer  based  membranes:  Polymers  containing  gas  binding  units  e.g.  oxygen 
limited

permeability.[1] 

•  Liquid  membranes:  Oxygen  binding  liquid  carrier  immobilized  in  a  polymer 

matrix.  They have moderate selectivity, but high permeability.[2] 

•  Nanoporous  carbon  membranes  (~  5  Å  pore  size):  The  separation  depends  on 

flow dynamic and gas particle size.[3] 

•  Ceramic  membranes:  La  &  Gd  based  ceramics  doped  with  impurities  to  create 

oxygen vacancies.  They actively transport oxygen at high temperatures.[4] 

•  Hollow  fiber  membranes:  Commercialized  by  Air  Products  to  separate  nitrogen 

from air.[5-7] 

In this study we developed and tested several membranes aimed at separating H2/CO2 and 
O2/CO2 to prevent carbon dioxide poisoning of alkaline fuel cells. 

Polymer Based Oxygen Selective Membrane: 

Many  metal  complexes  play  important  roles  in  oxygen  transport  by  reversibly  binding 
oxygen.    If  an  oxygen  binding  metal  complex  is  dispersed  in  a  polymer  membrane, 
oxygen can bind to it in a reversible manner and be transported through the membrane.  
Such a polymer-metal complex system can function as a gas separating membrane system 
exhibiting facilitated transport of oxygen across the polymer membrane.  Several Cobalt 
(II) porphyrin complexes (CoP), as shown in Figure 2.1, have been widely employed for 
this  purpose    [8-11].    The  porphyrin  ligand  around  the  cobalt  can  be  readily  tuned  to 
optimize oxygen-binding capabilities and facilitate transport.  Moreover, the ligands can 
be modified such that the oxygen-binding complex shows high solubility in a particular 
polymer matrix system.    

 

14

Figure 2.1: Structure of oxygen binding cobalt (II) porphyrin complexes 

Based  on  whether  the  carrier  is  fixed  or  mobile,  the  membranes  exhibiting  facilitated 
transport  can  be  broadly  classified  as  Fixed  Carrier  Polymer  Membranes  or  Mobile 
Carrier  Liquid  Membranes.    In  Fixed  Carrier  Polymer  Membranes,  the  oxygen-binding 
complex is either covalently bound to the solid polymer matrix or is physically dispersed 
in  the  solid  polymer.    The  stationary  porphyrin  molecules  reversibly  bind  and  unbind 
oxygen,  thereby  increasing  the  solubility  of  the  oxygen  in  the  membrane  and, 
consequently,  increasing  the  relative  flux  of  oxygen  through  the  polymer  matrix  (see 
Figure 2.2). 

Figure 2.2: Schematic of oxygen transport through Fixed Carrier Polymer Membrane 

In  Mobile  Carrier  Liquid  Membranes,  the  oxygen-binding  complex  is  dissolved  in  a 
liquid  medium,  which  is  immobilized  in  a  solid  polymer  matrix.    Since  the  oxygen-
binding  complex  molecule  is  mobile,  it  can  transport  oxygen  molecules  from  the  feed

stream  side  of  the  membrane  to  the  stripping  side  (see  Figure  2.3)  at  a  higher  rate 
compared to Fixed Carrier Polymer Membranes. 

Figure 2.3: Schematic of oxygen transport through Mobile Carrier Liquid Membrane 

A  comparison  of  the  two  membrane  systems  is  presented  in  Table  2.1  below.    A  large 
number of membrane systems exhibiting facilitated transport of oxygen over nitrogen by 
different  metal  complexes  have  been  reported  in  multiple  publications  [12].    A  few 
representative examples are given in Table 2. 2. 

Selection of Polymer Matrix for Immobilizing Oxygen Carrier: 

Polymers used for gas separation can be broadly classified as Size Selective or Solubility 
Selective.  The Size Selective membranes are made of stiff, chain, glassy polymers, such 
as polysulphone, polystyrene, etc.  They are more permeable to smaller molecules since 
they have a lower free volume.  The Solubility Selective membranes are made of highly 
flexible  polymers,  such  as  poly(dimethylsiloxane)  PDMS,  poly(1-trimethylsilyl-1-
propyne) PTMSP, etc.  They have higher free volumes and exhibit selectivity based on 
the solubility of different gases in the polymer.  The permeability and selectivity of the 
different gases by the two kinds of polymeric membranes are given in Table 2.3. 

It is clear that the nature of the polymer matrix has a large effect on both the permeability 
and  selectivity  of  the  membrane  towards  different  gases.    Hence,  the  oxygen  carrier 
Cobalt complex was incorporated into the range of different polymers (glassy, rigid with 
low free volume, somewhat rigid with high free volume and highly flexible and rubbery) 
to optimize the gas diffusion (permeability) and gas separation (selectivity) properties of 
the membrane.

H2/CO2  separation  and  Rationale  for  using  pure  polystyrene 
membranes for gas separation 

Any  polymeric  material  will  separate  gases  to  some  extent.  Proper  selection  of  the 
polymeric  material  comprising  the  membrane  is  extremely  important.  It  determines  the 
ultimate performance of the gas separation module. 

Module  productivity  for  a  given  base  material  is  determined  by  three  factors:  partial 
pressure  difference  across  the  membrane,  membrane  thickness  and  membrane  surface 
area.  The  partial  pressure  difference  is  typically  determined  by  the  specifics  of  the 
application. 

Figure  2.4  shows  the  separation  factor  for  several  gases-couples  as  a  function  of  pore 
diameters  in  the  membrane.    This  preferential  gas  separation  is  performed  mainly  on 
basis of molecule or atom size ratios.

From the table above it is clear that a pure polystyrene membrane would show a H2:CO2 
selectivity  of  2.15  and  would  effectively  filter  CO2  from  H2  in  a  dirty  hydrogen  fuel 
stream. Further chemical modifications in polystyrene( see Table 2.5 ) and modifications 
in membrane engineering could enable one to achieve even higher selectivity

A  number  of  other  polymers  also  exhibit  high  intrinsic  H2:CO2  selectivity  and  they  are 
listed  in  Table  2.6  below.    These  polymeric  materials  are  inexpensive  and  easy  to 
fabricate and could act as effective gas separation materials for use in alkaline fuel cells 
to prevent the CO2 poisoning problem.

Hence, a membrane made of pure poly vinyl chloride, which is a very inexpensive and 
readily available polymer should be able to theoretically improve the performance of an 
AFC running on dirty hydrogen by a factor of 10.8 times.  Once again further chemical 
and engineering modifications should enable one to achieve higher selectivity and lessen 
the  poisoning  of  the  electrolyte.    With  this  in  mind,  we  decided  to  use  “off  the  shelf”

polystyrene as the membrane matrix to try to separate H2/CO2 in dirty hydrogen fuel for 
alkaline fuel cells.  The results of the polystyrene interfaced H2/Air fuel cell operating on 
dirty hydrogen are discussed in the Results section of this report. 

Membrane Fabrication  

Four different kinds of polymers with different structures and properties were chosen as a 
membrane  matrix  for  the  described  application.    They  were  poly(styrene),  poly(methyl 
methacrylate),  poly(4-vinylpyridine)  and  poly(dimethylsiloxane).    Poly(styrene)  and 
poly(methyl  methacrylate)  were  chosen  for  their  toughness  and  durability/stability.  
Polyvinylpyridine  was  chosen  for  its  ability  to  coordinate  to  the  fifth  site  on  the  cobalt 
complex,  thereby  homogenously  fixing  the  cobalt  complex  to  the  polymer  matrix.  
Polydimethylsiloxane  was  chosen  for  its  high  gas  permeability  and  good  membrane 
forming  ability.    The  oxygen  binding  cobalt  complexes  used  were  5,  10,  15,  20-
Tetraphenyl-21H,  23H-porphine  cobalt(II)  –N-methylimidazole  (CoP)  and  Cobalt 
acetylacetonate  Co(acac).    CoP  was  synthesized  as  reported  in  literature[19].    Co(acac) 
was purchased from Aldrich and was used without further purification.  All solvents used 
were analytical grade with > 99.9% purity.  

The membrane fabrication technique is described as follows:  

Polystyrene  

Polystyrene (MW= 280,000), purchased from Aldrich, was dissolved in benzene to yield 
a 10wt% solution. Co(acac) and CoP solutions in chloroform were added to the polymer 
solution  to  yield  polymer  -  chelate  solutions  having  5wt%  and  10wt%  of  Co(acac)  and 
10wt% of CoP respectively. The additions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. 
The  resulting  polymer  –  chelate  solution  was  stirred  vigorously  to  homogenously 
distribute  the  cobalt  complex.  These  solutions  were  then  cast  onto  microporous  steel 
discs(  pore  size  =  200  micron  )  to  yield  supported  membranes.  After  the  initial  slow 
evaporation of the solvent for 24 hours, the polymer coated discs were kept in a vacuum 
for  another  24  hours  to  remove  any  solvents  present.  These  supported  polymer 
membranes were used to study gas selectivities, as described later. 

PMMA (Polymethylmethacrylate) 

Polymethylmethacrylate (MW=120,000) membranes were fabricated in the same way as 
polystyrene  membranes  described  above.  Microporous  steel  supported  PMMA 
membranes having 5wt% and 10wt% of Co(acac) and 10wt% of CoP, respectively, were 
prepared and used in gas selectivity studies, as described later. 

PDMS (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) 

A commercially available silicone elastomer, Sylgard 184 from Dow Corning, was used 
as the polymer matrix for the cobalt oxygen carrier complex.  Sylgard 184 consists of a 

 

21

silicone base and a curing agent which is mixed in a 10:1 ratio and cured to a solid by 
heating for an hour at 70°C.  We tried to cure the Sylgard 184 elastomer in the presence 
of  the  cobalt  complex  to  yield  PDMS  membranes  homogenously  embedded  with  the 
cobalt complex.  

CoP  and  Co(acac)  solutions  in  benzene  were  blended  with  the  silicone  base  to  get 
1.5wt% and 3wt% of the cobalt complex in the polymer.  The cobalt complex-polymer 
blend was kept under vacuum for 24 hours to remove the solvent from the blend.  The 
curing  agent  was  then  added  in  a  1:10  ratio  and  the  blend  was  mixed  thoroughly.    The 
viscous  mixture  was  then  spin  coated  onto  microporous  discs.    The  polymer  layer  was 
then  heated  at  70°C  in  a  nitrogen  atmosphere  to  cure  the  blend  into  a  solid  membrane.  
However,  even  after  24  hours  of  heating,  the  blend  failed  to  solidify  into  a  solid 
membrane.    Control  experiments  indicated  that  the  curing  agent  was  reacting  with  the 
cobalt porphyrin complex, thereby deactivating and failing to cross link the Sylgard base. 

The polymer coated discs were thoroughly wiped clean to remove the adhering viscous 
polymer blend.  It was thought that the viscous polymer blend would fill the 200 micron 
pores  of  the  microporous  disc,  thereby  effectively  yielding  a  liquid  membrane.    The 
microporous discs having pores filled with  the liquid PDMS–chelate was used to study 
gas selectivities, as described later.  

Polyvinylpyridine (PVP) 

(MW=160,000),  purchased 

from  Aldrich,  was  dissolved 

Polyvinylpyridine 
in 
nitromethane  to  yield  a  10  wt%  solution.    The  polymer  solution  was  deoxygenated  by 
bubbling nitrogen through the solution for 15 minutes. A 5, 10, 15, 20-Tetraphenyl-21H, 
23H-porphine cobalt (II) solution in chloroform was degassed and added to the polymer 
solution.    The  contents  were  then  stirred  under  nitrogen  for  3  hours  at  50°C  to  yield  a 
dark  red  solution.    The  pyridine  side  groups  of  polymer  coordinate  to  the  cobalt 
porphyrin molecules yielding the active oxygen carrier species.  This is shown in Figure 
2.5.    Two  solutions  having  5wt%  and  10wt%  CoP  w.r.t.  polymer  were  synthesized  as 
described above.  These solutions were then cast onto microporous steel discs(pore size = 
200  microns).    After  the  initial  slow  evaporation  of  the  solvent  for  24  hours,  the  discs 
were  kept  in  a  vacuum  for  another  24  hours  to  remove  any  solvents  present.    The 
microporous  discs,  along  with  the  adhering  membrane,  were  used  to  study  selectivity 
towards different gases.

N-Alkylated  polyvinylpyridine  was  also  synthesized  as  the  polymer  matrix  for 
immobilizing  the  oxygen-binding  cobalt  complex.  Polyvinylpyridine  from  Aldrich 
(MW= 160,000; Tg = 142 οC) was partially alkylated using 1-bromopropane to yield the 
polymer  having  the  desired  number  of  coordinating  pyridine  groups.  Polyvinylpyridine 
dissolved in nitromethane was heated with 1-bromopropane in a 1:0.8 molar ratio to yield 
the  partially  alkylated  polyvinylpyridine.  This  is  shown  schematically  in  Figure  2.6. 
NMR  analysis  of  the  polymer  showed  that  73%  of  the  pyridine  groups  were  alkylated. 
The polymer solution was degassed and 3wt% cobalt (II) tetraphenyl porphyrin solution 
in benzene was added to the polymer. The contents were then stirred together at 50°C for 
24 hours under nitrogen.  The dark red polymer–CoP solution obtained was used to cast 
membranes as described ahead. 

Freestanding  membranes  were  fabricated  by  spin  coating  the  polymer-CoP  solution  in 
nitromethane  on  a  glass  disc  (500  rpm  for  90  seconds)  using  a  Laurel  WS-400B  series 
spin coater.  The solution on the disc was allowed to evaporate and the spin coating was 
performed again.  After 5 such coatings, the polymer coated disc was dried for 5 hours 
under  vacuum.    However,  the  membranes  thus formed proved to be brittle and cracked 
during peeling from the glass disc.

To  make  more  robust  membranes,  the  polymer-CoP  solution  was  cast  onto  a  piece  of 
filter  paper  to  yield  supported  membranes.    Qualitative  filter  paper  by  VWR  (no-  415) 
was cut into the desired rectangular shape (5cm X 7cm) such that it could be mounted on 
top  of  the  air  cathode  of  the  fuel  cell.    Small  increments  of  the  polymer  solution  in 
nitromethane were poured on both sides of the filter paper.  The solution was allowed to 
evaporate slowly at room temperature to yield a dark brown polymer on the filter paper.  
After  an  appreciable  amount  of  polymer  had  been  deposited,  the  supported  membranes 
were  dried  under  vacuum  for  5  hours.    The  thickness  of  the  supported  membranes  was 
approximately 0.1 mm.  The dark brown supported membranes were interfaced with the 
fuel  cell  cathode  and  electrochemical  testing  of  the  cathode-membrane  unit  was 
performed to study the effect of carbonate poisoning.  

Membrane Permeation Studies 

We used a constant volume variable pressure (CVVP) gas permeation apparatus for our 
permeation studies.  The apparatus consists of an air tight stainless steel chamber divided 
in  two  halves  by  the  membrane  i.e.  upstream  and  downstream  chambers.    The  target 
membrane is cast on a micro-porous steel disc of specific dimensions which is designed 
to  fit  into  the  permeation  cell.    The  volume  of  the  downstream  chamber  is  known  and 
remains  constant.    The  upstream  side  is  maintained  at  a  known  fixed  pressure  of  the 
target  gas  (O2,  CO2  and  N2  )  while  the  downstream  chamber  (permeate  side)  is  under 
dynamic  vacuum.    The  dynamic  vacuum  is  then  switched  off  at  the  start  of  the 
measurement.    As  the  target  gas  permeates  from  the  upstream  side  to  the  downstream 
side through the membrane, the pressure increases in the downstream side chamber.  This 
pressure  increase  with  time  is  monitored  in  the  downstream  chamber  using  a  Baratron 
absolute pressure gauge.  Permeability of different gases can be measured using a simple 
formula.

The  methodology  and  laboratory  set  up  used  to  collect  data  needed  for  the 
quantification of the phenomenon of carbon dioxide poisoning of the alkaline

enriched atmosphere.

calculate  the  time  at  which  the  electrolyte  is  needed  to  be  flushed  out  to 
maintain the cell performance at a desired level.

Part  3.1  Quantification  of  Carbon  dioxide  Poisoning  in  Air 
Breathing Alkaline Fuel Cells 

Introduction 

Carbon  dioxide  intolerance  has  impeded  the  development  of  alkaline  fuel  cells  as  an 
alternate  power  source.    The  CO2  “poisoning”  of  the  fuel  cell  electrolyte  could  come 
from the anode side (if “dirty” H2 is used as fuel), from the cathode side (if air instead of 
pure  O2  is  used  as  an  oxidant),  or  from  inside  the  electrolyte  (if  methanol  is  used  as  a 
fuel).    In  this  work,  a  novel  analytical  approach  is  employed  to  study  and  quantify  the 
carbon dioxide poisoning problem.  Accelerated tests were carried out in an alkaline fuel 
cell using methanol as a fuel with different electrical loads and varying the concentration 
of carbon dioxide in a mixture of CO2/O2 used as oxidant.  Two characteristic quantities, 
tmax,  Rmax  and  α  (discussed  in  section  3.2),  were  specified,  which  were  shown  to 
comprehensively define the nature and extent of the carbon dioxide poisoning in alkaline 
fuel  cells.    Section  3.2  focuses  on  the  quantification  and  model  development  of  the 
carbon dioxide poisoning in alkaline fuel cells.   

Experimental 

Accelerated CO2 poisoning studies 

Small  alkaline  fuel  cells  operating  on  methanol  as  a  fuel  were  purchased  from  the 
Department of Chemistry at The University of Hong Kong (Model # HKU-002C).  The 
cathode was an AC-65 air cathode manufactured by Alupower, Inc. [1].  The anode was 
fabricated  on  a  nickel  foam  mat  with  a  mixture  of  Pt/Co/Ni  catalyst  for  methanol 
oxidation.  The area of the anode was 18 cm2 as compared to 10 cm2 of the cathode.  The 

 

27

anode  and  cathode  were  separated  by  approximately  0.8  cm  of  an  alkaline  electrolyte.  
The cell body was made of plexiglass, which can be hermetically sealed during operation.  
The  fuel  cells  were  soaked  with  deionized  water  for  24  hours  prior  to  each  cell  run  in 
order  to  ensure  that  the  air-cathode  had  been  properly  soaked  and  wetted  so  as  to 
maximize the active area for electrochemical reactions.  For each cell run, a mixture of 30 
ml of 1 M potassium hydroxide (purchased from Aldrich) and 3 ml of 99.8% anhydrous 
methanol  (purchased  from  Aldrich)  was  used  as  the  electrolyte.  Figure  3.1  shows  the 
polarization curves for these fuels at three different electrolyte concentrations. We notice 
that as the K2CO3 concentration increases in the electrolyte, both activation polarization 
and ohmic polarization increase, resulting in lower current output at a given voltage.

For  operating  the  fuel  cell  in  atmospheres  with  different  concentrations  of  oxygen  and 
carbon dioxide, an air-tight plexiglass chamber was designed in which the cell could be 
placed and operated. A schematic of our experimental setup is shown in Figure 3.2.  The 
chamber  had  an  inlet  for  the  gases  mixed  in  different  ratios  and  was  maintained  at  a 
slightly  positive  pressure  by  dipping  the  outlet  in  2  cm  of  water.    This  was  done  to 
prevent  any  gases  in  the  atmosphere  from  leaking  inside.    Appropriate  metal  contacts 
were provided so the cell could be connected to an external load and an electrochemical 
data  recorder  which  was  placed  outside.    Oxygen  and  carbon  dioxide  were  mixed  in 
different  ratios  using  a  gas  proportioner,  model  no.  7951-4-4,  obtained  from  Specialty 
Gas  Equipment  (Ohio).    The  gas  proportioner  was  capable  of  mixing  gases  in  any 
proportion with an accuracy of 1 - 2%.  Different mixtures of oxygen and carbon dioxide 
(99.99%  purity  purchased  from  MG  Industries,  PA)  were  introduced  into  the  test 
chamber  with  the  fuel  cell  operating  inside.    A  load  of  known  resistance  was  applied 

 

28

across the fuel cell and an electrochemical data recorder, Auto AC DSP purchased from 
ACM  Instruments  (UK),  was  used  to  measure  and  record  the  cell  current  for 
approximately 5 hours at an interval of 4 seconds each.

Figure 3.2 Schematic of the experimental setup used for accelerated CO2 poisoning experiments. 

Cell runs with carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere at 5%, 15%, 25%, 30%, 50% and 
80% were carried out as described above.  For every atmospheric composition, external 
loads of 1.3 Ω, 2.8 Ω, 5.2 Ω and 10.2 Ω were applied and the cell current was recorded.  
In this way, we generated a library of the fuel cell performances in different atmospheres 
and  with  different  applied  loads.  The  data  gathered  from  the  experiments,  explained 
above, were used in quantification and model development of CO2 observed in our fuel 
cells. 

Part  3.2.  Phenomenological  Model  of  Carbon  dioxide  Poisoning  in 
Alkaline Fuel Cells 

Introduction 

We developed a model which predicts CO2 poisoning effect in AFC, with non-circulating 
electrolyte  (KOH  aq.)  and  methanol  as  the  fuel,  under  conditions  of  accelerated 
poisoning.    These  accelerated  conditions  were  created  by  operating  the  fuel  cell  in 
atmosphere  enriched  with  CO2  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section.    Based  on  the 
experimental data generated as described in section 3.1, we have defined three variable 
parameters,  tmax,  Rmax  and  α  which  accurately  describe  and  predict  the  onset  and

magnitude  of  poisoning  in  AFCs  under  different  operating  conditions.    The  first  two 
quantities are shown in Figure 3.3, which plots the current vs. time and current decay rate 
vs. time for a fuel cell operating in CO2 enriched atmosphere (85%O2-15%CO2).  tmax is 
the time at which the current decay rate is maximum while Rmax is the value of current 
decay  rate  at  this  time.    Although  the  current  decay  rate  value  (Rmax)  is  negative,  its 
magnitude (absolute value) is plotted in the figure below.

The last quantity ‘α’ is the ratio of cell current at t = tmax to the initial steady state current 
observed.  The initial steady state current is generally taken as the current value observed 
after 600 seconds of the start of the experiment. 

How Does the Model Work?  

As  mentioned  earlier,  we  defined  three  quantities  tmax,  Rmax  and  α  which  are 
characteristics of a fuel cell’s performance in a carbon dioxide enriched atmosphere (for 
definitions  refer  section  1).    For  a  given  set  of  operating  conditions,  values  of  these 
characteristic quantities have a unique value.  The idea is to find out the dependency of 
these  quantities  on  the  chosen  operating  parameters  (CO2  concentration  and  applied 
load).  We carried out accelerated carbon dioxide poisoning experiments for different sets 
of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and applied load using the methodology and 
experimental setup discussed in section 3.1.  Values of tmax, Rmax and α were calculated

graphically and then their dependence on the operating parameters was determined.  We 
found  out  certain  unique  trends  in  which  the  characteristic  quantities  vary  with  the 
operating parameters.  For example, Variation of tmax with the applied load was linear for 
all  the  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  concentrations  (refer  to  Figure  3.4).    Similarly,  the 
variation of Rmax with the applied load was hyperbolic (refer to Figure 3.5).  

The value of α lies between 0.5 and 0.8, depending on the operating conditions.  Higher 
carbon dioxide concentration and lower applied load increases the value of α.  Using the 
plots in Figures 3.4 and 3.5, we could predict the value of tmax and Rmax for any carbon 
dioxide concentration in the range of 10% to 50% by volume and for any load between 
1Ω  and  10Ω.    Once  the  values  of  these  characteristic  quantities  are  known,  the 
methodology to theoretically predict the current vs. time plot of a fuel cell is described in 
the next section.

Methodology: 

The next question which arises is “how do we model the time dependency of current with 
the  prior  knowledge  of  tmax,  Rmax  and  α?”    Suppose  that  operating  conditions  (CO2 
concentration and applied load) are specified.  For these values of operating parameters 
we can accurately determine the values of our characteristics quantities (tmax, Rmax and α) 
as described earlier in this section.  Once these values are known, the following steps are 
carried  out  in  the  given  order  to  determine  the  current  vs.  time  curve  for  a  fuel  cell 
undergoing CO2 poisoning: 

On  a  two  dimensional  plot  with  X  axis  representing  time  ‘t’  (in  hours)  and  Y  axis 
representing cell current ‘i’ (in mA) 

1)  Two  straight  lines  are  plotted  with  equations  i  =  iss(KOH)  and  i  =  iss(K2CO3)  (refer 
Figure 3.6). The first straight line corresponds to steady state current given by the 
cell  when  it  has  100%  KOH  as  the  electrolyte.  While  the  other  straight  line 
corresponds to case of 100% K2CO3 electrolyte. The values of steady state current 
at  the  specified  load  can  be  determined  from  the  polarization  curves  of  our  fuel 
cells with pure KOH and K2CO3 as the electrolyte, as shown in figure 3.1. 

2)  The  point  corresponding  to  the  coordinate  (tmax,  α  X  iss(KOH))  is  plotted  on  the 
same graph (Figure 3.6). This point shows the state of the fuel cell at t = tmax as 

 

32

we know that cell current at this time is α times the steady state current when the 
electrolyte is 100% KOH (refer to the definition of α). 

3)  A  straight  line  is  plotted,  passing  through  this  point  and  with  a  slope  equal  to 
Rmax. This was done because we know that at t = tmax the rate of current decay is 
equal to Rmax (Figure 3.6). 

4)  The straight line plotted in step 3 intersects with the two straight lines plotted in 
step 1 resulting in a ‘Z’ shaped plot. We choose 5 points on this ‘Z’ shaped plot in 
such a way that we could plot a 4th degree Lagrange’s polynomial through these 
points.  1st  point  is  chosen  as  (0,  iss(KOH)),  which  marks  the  beginning  of  the 
experiment at t = 0 and 100% KOH as electrolyte. The 3rd point is chosen as (tmax, 
α X iss(KOH)) for the reason described in step 2. The 5th point is chosen as (3Xtmax, 
iss(K2CO3)) because it marks the end of the experiment. The rationale of choosing 
the 5th point is that at t = 3 X tmax we are certain that the entire electrolyte has been 
fully converted to K2CO3 irrespective of the operating conditions. The 2nd and 4th 
points are chosen such that they are the midpoints of the 1st point and the point of 
intersection of line 1 and line 3 and the 5th point and the point of intersection of 
line 2 and line 3, respectively. The coordinates of the 2nd point and the 4th point 
are  given  by  ([(1-α)iss(KOH)/Rmax  +  tmax],iss(KOH))  and  ([(  iss(K2CO3)  -  αiss(KOH) 
+Rmaxtmax)/Rmax]  ,iss(K2CO3)), respectively. Since we know the values of tmax, Rmax, 
α, iss(KOH) and  iss(K2CO3), we could find out the numerical values of these 5 points. 

5)  From step 4 we have 5 points as  

1st point: (0, iss(KOH)) 

2nd point: ([(1-α)iss(KOH)/Rmax + tmax],iss(KOH)) 

3rd point: (tmax, α iss(KOH)) 

4th point: ([( iss(K2CO3) - αiss(KOH) +Rmaxtmax)/Rmax]  ,iss(K2CO3)) 

5th point: (3tmax, iss(K2CO3)) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Through these 5 points, we can fit a Lagrange’s 4th degree polynomial which would be 
the modeled current vs. time curve of a fuel cell operating in specified accelerated 
poisoning conditions. We wrote a MATLAB program, which, when given an input of the 
characteristic  quantities  (tmax,  Rmax  and  α)  would  generate  the  modeled  i  vs.  t  curve 
(Figure 3.6).

Part 3.3: Polymer Membranes for Alkaline Fuel Cells Running 
on Dirty Hydrogen: Mitigation of the CO2 Poisoning Effect. 

Introduction 

One possible solution to the carbon dioxide poisoning in alkaline fuel cells is to filter out 
CO2 from the reactants gas streams.  The efficiency of filtration need not be 100% and 
would  depend  on  the  nature  of  the  filter  used  to  carry  out  the  CO2  separation.    In  this 
work  we  explored  the  possibility  of  using  polymer  membranes  to  mitigate  the  carbon 
dioxide poisoning in alkaline fuel cells.  The experiments were carried out with the fuel 
cells  operating  in  CO2  contaminated  hydrogen  on  the  anode  side  or  oxygen  on  the 
cathode side.  In general, because the comparative size of the molecules of H2, CO2, and 
O2,  it  is  relatively  easy  to  separate  CO2  from  H2  only  by  choosing  a  size  selective 
polymer  membrane  with  the  correct  pore  size  (Figure  3.9).    However,  it  is  extremely 
difficult  to  separate  the  CO2  from  the  O2  because  of  the  similarity  in  their  similar  size.  
Accordingly,  different  types  of  membranes  (Polymer-porphyrine  membranes)  are 
proposed  to  be  used  to  separate  CO2  from  O2.    We  independently  investigated  the 
efficiency of our membranes on the anode side and cathode side.  This part of the report 
presents the results of the polymer membrane study when the anode gas stream (H2) was 
contaminated  with  5  Vol%  CO2.  Air  (0.03  Vol%  CO2)  was  used  at  the  cathode  side. 

 

34

Owing  to  the  lesser  CO2  concentration,  poisoning  due  to  the  cathode  gas  stream  was 
assumed to be negligible.     

It was found that polymer membranes of polystyrene were highly effective in alleviating 
the detrimental effect of carbon dioxide poisoning from the use of “dirty” hydrogen as a 
fuel.  This reduction of CO2 poisoning is translated in a very significant increment in the 
life of a fuel cell simply by placing a polystyrene membrane in the anode gas stream in 
such  a  way  that  the  gases  pass  through  it.    To  quantify  the  effect,  we  compared  the 
current  output  of  our  cells  at  a  given  load  when  the  anode  gas  stream  was  with  and 
without  the  polymer  membranes.    The  techniques  used  and  the  results  achieved  are 
discussed below.  

Experimental 

Materials 

LabCell-50  alkaline  fuel  cells  were  purchased  from  Astris  Energi,  Inc.  for  the 
experiments.  They operated with 2-5 M KOH (aq.) as the electrolyte, H2 as the fuel on 
the  anode  side  and  O2  as  the  oxidant  on  the  cathode  side.    The  active  area  of  the 
electrodes  was  50  cm2  and  the  open  circuit  potential  (OCP)  was  0.9-1.0  V.    All  the 
experiments were conducted at room temperature.   

Any  polymeric  material  will  separate  gases  to  some  extent.    Proper  selection  of  the 
polymetric  material  comprising  the  membrane  is  extremely  important,  as  it  determines 
the ultimate performance of the gas separation module.  Module productivity for a given 
base  material  is  determined  by  three  factors:  partial  pressure  difference  across  the 
membrane,  membrane  thickness  and  membrane  surface  area.    The  partial  pressure 
difference is typically determined by the specifics of the application. 

Fuel Cell Testing 

Alkaline  fuel  cells  (LabCell  50  purchased  from  Astris  Energi  Inc)  operating  on 
air/hydrogen  were  used  for  the  experimentation.  The  electrolyte  was  aqueous  2  molar 
KOH  and  was  circulated  through  the  cell  using  a  peristaltic  pump  at  a  rate  of  1  ml/s.  
Pressurized air and hydrogen at an absolute pressure of 24.6 PSI were fed to the fuel cell 
cathode and anode as the oxidant and fuel source, respectively.  

In a typical experiment a load of 1 Ω was placed across the cell and the cell was operated 
on air/H2 for 2 hours. The H2 was contaminated by 5 Vol% CO2 which was introduced in 
the  anode  gas  stream  by  a  gas  proportioner  (model  no.  7951-4-4  purchased  from 
Specialty  Gas  Equipment,  OH).  All  gases  were  99.99%  pure  and  were  purchased  from 
MG  Industries,  PA.  An  electrochemical  data  recorder,  Auto  AC  DSP  purchased  from 
ACM  Instruments  (UK),  was  used  to  measure  and  record  the  cell  current  output  for  2 
hours. 

 

35

The  current  output  for  the  fuel  cells  running  on  “dirty”  hydrogen  and  air  at  a  constant 
load of 1 Ω, were digitally recorded, both with and without the polystyrene membranes 
placed in the hydrogen gas stream.  When a polystyrene membrane is placed in between 
the anode gas stream and the cell we expect some enrichment of H2 in the permeated gas 
because of the size selective nature of polystyrene polymer [3]. We observed that our fuel 
cell’s  life  increased  appreciably  when  using  the  polystyrene  membrane  as  compared  to 
the case when there was no membrane in the anode gas stream. The results are discussed 
in detail in the next section.

Chapter 1.  Findings, Discussion, and Recommendations 

This second part of the report contains five main Parts: 

Part  1:  Ppermeability  study  conducted  on  the  polymer-porphyrine  membranes.    The 
membranes were designed to show oxygen selectivity by incorporating cobalt porphyrine 
in the polymer matrix. 

Part  2:  Quantification  of  CO2  poisoning  in  alkaline  fuel  cells  under  conditions  of 
accelerated  poisoning.    The  quantification  was  based  on  only  two  operating  parameters 
viz. %CO2 in atmosphere and applied electric load. 

Part  3:  Experimental  validation  of  the  phenomenological  model  developed,  which  is 
capable  of  predicting  a  fuel  cell’s  performance  when  operating  in  CO2  enriched 
atmosphere.  Data gathered in part 2 was used to validate the model, which proved to be 
significantly accurate. 

Part  4:  Performance  study  of  the  fuel  cells  when  polymer  membranes  (polystyrene, 
polyvinyl pyridine) were interfaced with the air cathode.  The parameters defined in the 
quantification study of CO2 poisoning (part 2) were used to compare the efficiencies of 
the polymer membranes in reducing the CO2 poisoning in fuel cells.   

Part 5: Performance study of the fuel cells when polymer membranes (polystyrene) were 
interfaced  with  the  anode  stream.    Unlike  the  results  discussed  in  part  4,  the  hydrogen 
(anode) stream was contaminated with CO2 (“dirty” hydrogen) and air was used on the 
cathode side. 

These 5-parts are divided into two chapters.  Chapter 1 presents the results and discusses 
the findings of the five parts, while Chapter 2 presents future recommendations for each 
part.

The selectivity of the membrane for the two different gases was calculated by taking the 
ratio of molar fluxes for the two gases.  The selectivity of various polystyrene membranes 
towards oxygen/nitrogen and oxygen/carbon dioxide at an upstream side pressure of 25 
psi is summarized in Figure 1.1.1.

(measured at an upstream side pressure of 25 psi) 

 

 

As can be seen from fig 1.1.1, a pure polystyrene membrane has an O2/N2 and O2/CO2 
selectivity of less than 1.  This indicates that a pure polystyrene membrane has a higher 
permeability for N2 and CO2 than for oxygen.  Introduction of the oxygen binding cobalt 
complexes  slightly  increased  the  O2/N2  selectivity  to  above  1,  indicating  that  the 
membrane is becoming more permeable to oxygen.  This indicates facilitated transport of 
oxygen  across  the  membrane  due  to  the  cobalt  chelate.    However,  very  little  change/

increase was observed in O2/CO2 selectivity.  Moreover, all gas selectivities were close to 
1,  thereby,  clearly  indicating  that  this  type  of  membrane  was  not  very  effective  in 
separating gases under the test conditions.

The selectivity of the membrane for the two different gases was calculated by taking the 
ratio of molar fluxes for the two gases. The selectivity of various polymethylmethacrylate 
membranes  towards  oxygen/nitrogen  and  oxygen/carbon  dioxide  at  an  upstream  side 
pressure of 21 psi is given in Figure 1.1.2.

The results were similar to those seen for polystyrene based membranes described earlier.  
Slight  increases  in  O2/N2  selectivities  were  observed  for  membranes  having  the  cobalt 
chelates.    However  this  increase  was  not  substantial  and  all  measured  gas  selectivities 
were  close  to  1,  thereby,  indicating  that  the  membrane  was  not  effective  in  separating 
gases under the test conditions.  

(3) PDMS 

Sylgard  based  poly(dimethylsiloxane)membranes  failed  to  solidify  with  the  cobalt 
complexes.  We decided to go ahead and test these membranes as liquid membranes held 
in the pores of a solid support.  However, the CVVP apparatus could not be used to study 
the  selectivity  of  the  sylgard  based  PDMS  liquid  membrane  systems  where  the  oxygen 
binding  carrier  complex  is  dissolved  in  a  liquid/liquid-gel  and  held  in  a  micro  porous 
solid support matrix.  Due to the large pressure difference between the upstream and the 
downstream  chambers  (~14  psi)  the  liquid/liquid-gel was forced out of the pores of the 
solid support and no data on selectivity was obtained.

The  permeability  results  for  the  different  polyvinylpyridine  membranes  casted  on

10% polyvinylpyridine membranes towards oxygen/nitrogen and oxygen/carbon dioxide

an upstream side pressure of 16 psi).   

The permeability tests discussed above show the results for a stand alone membrane not 
interfaced  with  the  fuel  cell.    A  large  pressure  difference  between  the  two  sides  of  the 
membrane  resulted  in  a  larger  diffusion  of  the  gases  across  the  membrane,  which 
swamped  the  effect  of  the  selectivity,  i.e.  “facilitated  transport”  of  gases.    Hence, 
selectivity for most of the membranes studied yielded selectivity around 1, indicating that 
the  membranes  were  not  very  effective  in  keeping  out  carbon  dioxide  under  the  test 
conditions.    However,  one  trend  seen  in  the  CVVP  testing  of  all  membranes  was  that 
blending  the  cobalt  complexes  with  the  polymer  increased  the  O2/N2  selectivity,  albeit 
slightly.    We  think  that  this  indicates  that  a  positive  contribution  to  selective  oxygen 
permeability due to the cobalt complex is in fact occurring.  However, this contribution 
could  not  be  studied  and  quantified  accurately  by  the  CVVP  technique.    Therefore,  a 
recommendation to overcome this problem is discussed in the last section of this report.

Part  2.  Results  and  Discussion  on  the  Quantification  of  CO2 
Poisoning  in  Air  Breathing,  Methanol  Fueled  Alkaline  Fuel 
Cell. 

Accelerated Testing: tmax and Rmax

As  explained  in  Chapter  3.2  of  the  Activities  section  of  this  report,  we  defined  two 
variables,  tmax  (unit  of  time)  and  Rmax  (units  of  current/time),  to  quantify  the  CO2 
“poisoning”  in  alkaline  fuel  cells.    These  two  variables  were  used  to  compare  and 
contrast  the  cell  performances  when  operated  in  a  CO2  enriched  atmosphere.    To 
elucidate  the  physical  meaning  of  tmax  and  Rmax,  current  vs.  time  plots  of  a  fuel  cell 
running (1) in air and (2) in a gas mixture of 85% O2-15% CO2 are shown in Figure 1.2.1.  
The plot of the fuel cell running in a carbon dioxide enriched atmosphere has a sigmoid 
shape, which is characteristic of the fuel cells undergoing carbon dioxide poisoning with 
a  non-circulating  electrolyte.    At  the  beginning  of  the  experiment  when  most  of  the 
electrolyte was a mixture of KOH and methanol, the current output was recorded as 83 
mA  (for  HKU-002C  fuel  cells  obtained  from  Hong  Kong  University).    As  the  CO2 
poisoning began to affect the cell’s electrolyte, current output decreased gradually for the 
first hour but then started falling rapidly at around 1.5 hours.  At the end of the run, the 
current  stabilized  at  15  mA  and  remained  stable  no  matter  how  long  carbon  dioxide 
enriched oxygen was fed into the fuel cell.  At the time of 1.5 hours, the KOH had been 
completely converted to K2CO3 by the CO2 reacting in the electrolyte  The time at which 
current decay rate is the highest is referred to as tmax and the value of current decay rate 
(dI/dt) corresponding to this time is Rmax.  

These characteristic quantities are graphically represented in Figure 1.2.2, in which rate 
of current decay is plotted with time.  The value of the current decay rate was highest at 
1.5 hours (tmax) and had a value of -33.5 mA/hr (Rmax).  Since the CO2 “poisoning” would 
be negligible in a time span of 3-5 hours when the cell is running in air (0.03% CO2), tmax 
and Rmax were essentially absent as shown in Figure 1.2.2.  Thus, the inverted bell shaped 
curve  in  Figure  1.2.2  is  characteristic  of  a  fuel  cell  being  poisoned  in  an  atmosphere 
enriched with CO2 and was observed in all accelerated poisoning cell runs. 

What  is  the  rationale  of  quantifying  CO2  poisoning  in  terms  of  tmax  and  Rmax?  If  the 
values of tmax and Rmax are known for an alkaline fuel cell undergoing poisoning, one can 
precisely  predict  the  course  of  the  cell  current  with  the  passage  of  time  using  the 
phenomenological  model  developed  in  this  work  (refer  to  section  3.2  in  the  Activities 
section).

Thus,  we  found  the  dependence  of  tmax  and  Rmax  as  a  function  of  operating  parameters, 
i.e.  atmospheric  CO2  concentration  and  cell  applied  load,  so  that  by  knowing  these 
quantities, one can predict the cell performance over a period of time in a CO2 enriched 
atmosphere using the phenomenological model.  In addition, the quantities tmax and Rmax 
would  also  serve  as  benchmarks  to  compare  the  performance  of  a  cell  at  different  CO2 
“poisoning”  or  cell  life  scenarios.    Any  improvement  in  the  performance  at  a  given 
atmospheric composition and load is reflected on the values of these quantities.   

For  a  given  set  of  operating  conditions,  tmax  and  Rmax  have  specific  values  but  if  the 
process of poisoning is delayed or in other words, the cell life is prolonged, the value of 
tmax will go up and Rmax will go down. 

Dependence of tmax

a) tmax dependence on carbon dioxide concentration:  

tmax varies inversely with the rate of carbon dioxide poisoning.  The value of tmax would 
be  smaller  for  a  faster  rate  of  poisoning.      Accordingly,  as  the  percentage  of  carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the value of tmax decreases.   Figure 1.2.3 illustrates 
this  concept  by  showing  the  dependence  of  tmax  on  the  atmospheric  concentration  of 
carbon  dioxide  at  298oK.    As  shown  in  Figure  1.2.3,  tmax  varied  quasi-linearly  with  the 
carbon dioxide concentration between 10% and 30%.  As the concentration went higher 
than 30%, the relation lost linearity and eventually stabilized at 0.8 hours.  The deviation 
from  the  linearity  above  30%  can  be  explained  by  the  fixed  permeability  of  the  carbon 
dioxide  through  the  air  cathode.    Even  though  the  amount  of  carbon  dioxide  in  the 
atmosphere increased, its entry into the cell (electrolyte) was limited by the permeability 
of the air cathode.  On the other hand, at carbon dioxide concentrations below 10%, the 
plot again deviated from linearity and touched the Y-axis asymptotically.  The reason for 
the  sharp  increase  in  tmax  values  below  10%  is  that  as  the  carbon  dioxide  concentration 
approaches  zero,  a  fuel  cell  would  take  an  infinitely  long  time  to  degrade  (considering 
only  CO2  poisoning  as  the  degradating  factor).    Consequently,  tmax  would  approach 
infinity.  

b) tmax dependence on applied load:  

Interestingly, tmax was also found to be a strong function of the load applied on the fuel 
cell.    Figure  1.2.4  shows  the  dependence  of  tmax  on  the  applied  load  at  different 
concentrations  of  carbon  dioxide  in  the  atmosphere.    As  before,  all  experimental 
parameters,  other  than  the  applied  load  and  the  carbon  dioxide  concentration  in  the 
chamber,  were  kept  constant.    For  every  CO2  concentration,  as  the  applied  load  on  the 
cell was decreased, the value of tmax went down.  At 15% concentration of carbon dioxide 
in the atmosphere, the value of tmax was 3.6 hours with a load of 10.2 Ω as compared to 
1.5  hours  with  a  load  of  1.3  Ω.    Small  loads  seemed  to  expedite  the  carbon  dioxide 
poisoning in the fuel cells.  A smaller load would withdraw a higher current from the fuel 
cell.    It  would  mean  that  the  rate  at  which  oxygen  is  being  consumed  at  the  cathode  is 
also  high.    A  higher  consumption  rate  would  lead  to  higher  intake  of  oxygen  from  the

atmosphere.  Since, carbon dioxide is also present in the atmosphere, the rate of carbon 
dioxide intake would go up simultaneously, leading to faster cell degradation.

Figure 1.2.3: Dependence of tmax on the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere at 298 K with an 
applied load of 1.3 Ω. 

Dependence of Rmax

a) Rmax dependence on CO2 concentration:  

The  dependence  of  Rmax  on  the  concentration  of  carbon  dioxide  in  the  atmosphere  is 
straight  forward.    Higher  concentrations  of  carbon  dioxide  would  lead  to  higher 
poisoning rates and, hence, larger Rmax values.  Figure 1.2.5 shows the variation in Rmax 
with  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  concentration  when  the  applied  load  was  1.3  Ω.    It  is 
observed  that  Rmax varied  quasi-linearly  with  carbon  dioxide  concentration  between  5% 
and  30%  in  the  atmosphere.    As  the  concentration  of  carbon  dioxide  was  increased 
further,  the  linearity  was  lost  and  Rmax  stabilized  at  approximately  -65  mA/hour.    This 
observation  indicates  that  at  very  high  concentrations  of  carbon  dioxide  (>  60%),  Rmax 
essentially  becomes  constant  at  a  specified  load.    The  reason  for  this  departure  from 
linearity at high CO2 concentrations is similar to that observed with tmax in the preceding 
section,  i.e.  limited  permeability  of  the  air  cathode.    On  the  other  hand,  when  the 

12 

concentration of carbon dioxide approached zero, the Rmax value also tended to zero.  It 
can  be  confirmed  by  extrapolating  the  curve  in  Figure  1.2.5  towards  0%  concentration 
values.    This  suggests  that  at  infinitesimally  small  carbon  dioxide  concentrations,  Rmax 
would  be  infinitesimally  small  and,  hence,  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  would  be  too 
negligible to measure.

applied load of 1.3 Ω.  

b) Rmax dependence on applied load:  

Rmax was also found to be strongly influenced by the applied load, as in the case with tmax.  
Figure  1.2.6  shows  that  Rmax  varied  with  the  applied  load  in  a  hyperbolic  fashion.    It 
should be noted that in figure 1.2.6 the absolute value of Rmax is plotted.  In reality, the 
Rmax value is negative because of the decay of the current.  Reasons for higher absolute 
values of Rmax at smaller loads are the same as for lower tmax values at smaller loads.  But 
unlike  tmax,  Rmax  became  an  even  stronger  function  of  the  applied  load  at  very  high 
concentrations of carbon dioxide (>50%).  Figure 1.2.6 also indicates that as the carbon 
dioxide concentration was reduced, the dependence of Rmax on the applied load decreased 
and,  at  extremely  small  concentrations,  this  dependence  would  cease  to  exist.    This  is 
opposite  of  the  behavior  of  tmax,  which  became  sensitive  to  the  applied  load  at  lower 
carbon dioxide concentrations.   

Therefore, we suggest that at low carbon dioxide concentrations (< 2%), the poisoning is 
defined  by  tmax  as  Rmax  becomes  largely  invariable.    In  the  same  way,  at  high  carbon 
dioxide  concentrations  (>  60%),  the  poisoning  is  defined  by  Rmax  as  tmax  becomes 
constant.  And at intermediate concentrations of carbon dioxide, we need to specify both 
quantities in order to completely define the carbon dioxide poisoning in the AFC.  Thus, 
the  above  studies  lead  us  to  conclude  that  for  any  future  testing  of  AFCs  using  the 
accelerated  poisoning  methodology,  the  best  region  to  study  the  cell  is  between  10%–
30% of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

CO2 Production by Internal Oxidation of Methanol 

One  possible  complication  in  interpreting  the  results  could  arise  because  of  the  in  situ 
carbon dioxide production by the oxidation of the methanol.  Since methanol was used as 
the  fuel,  carbon  dioxide  was  produced  as  a  by-product  of  the  anodic  oxidation  of 
methanol according to the following reaction. 

CH3OH   +   6OH-    (cid:198)    CO2   +   5H2O   +   6e- 

The  above  reaction  shows  that  1  mole  of  methanol  produces  1  mole  of  carbon  dioxide 
during complete oxidation.   Thus, a passage of current would cause production of carbon 
dioxide  at  the  anode  and,  hence,  contribute  to  the  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  in  the  fuel 
cells.  In addition, another source of carbon dioxide inside the fuel cells is the parasitic 
oxidation of methanol at the cathode due to methanol reactions.  Therefore, it is necessary 
to quantify the cumulative production of carbon dioxide by the oxidation of methanol and 
delineate its contribution to the total carbon dioxide poisoning measured; i.e. we need to 
separate  the  contribution  of  the  CO2  poisoning  when  the  CO2  contamination  is  coming 
from the cathode and when the CO2 is coming from the methanol reactions. 

By  decreasing  the  applied  load  (allowing  higher  current  flows),  we  would  increase  the 
contribution of internally generated carbon dioxide (methanol oxidation reactions) in the 
total carbon dioxide poisoning effect.  In order to relate the amount of K2CO3 formed by 
CO2  contamination  of  the  alkaline  electrolyte  (see  Chapter  1  of  “Project  Activities” 

15 

section)  solely  due  to  the  internal  methanol  oxidation  to  the  total  amount  of  K2CO3 
formed when contaminated with CO2 oxidant is used at the air cathode, we ran our fuel 
cells in a 100% O2 environment for 3.33 hours.  Consequently, the conversion of KOH to 
K2CO3  will  be  solely  due  to  the  CO2  generated  internally  by  methanol  oxidation.    We 
started  each  run  with  1M  of  KOH  fresh  solution  as  the  electrolyte.    At  the  end  of  the 
experiment,  the  electrolyte  was  sampled  out  and  its  composition  was  determined  using 
Winkler’s method of volumetric hydroxide/carbonate estimation using bromocresol green 
and phenolphthalein as the indicators [1].  N2 was bubbled for 2-3 minutes through the 
sampled electrolyte before each titration was carried out.  This was done in order to get 
rid  of  any  dissolved  carbon  dioxide  in  the  electrolyte.    Dissolved  carbon  dioxide  might 
affect  the  titration  results  by  forming  traces  of  carbonic  acid  (H2CO3).    Results  of  this 
composition analysis are presented in Figure 1.2.7, which plots K2CO3 formed or KOH 
remaining  as  a  function  of  the  applied  load  after  a  run  of  3.33  hours  in  a  100%  O2 
environment.

load was determined (Figure 1.2.8).  Figure 1.2.8 shows a linear dependence of K2CO3 
formed with time at an applied load of 1Ω and an atmosphere of 100% O2.  The straight 
line describing this time dependence passes through the origin as shown in Figure 1.2.8.

other  applied  loads  for  further  calculations.    In  order  to  determine  the  contribution  of 
internally generated carbon dioxide in the net carbon dioxide poisoning, it was necessary 
to  know  the  time  at  which  all  of  the  KOH  converted  to  K2CO3  for  any  operating 
condition.  Using  the  Winkler’s  method  of  volumetric  titration  for  the  electrolyte 
composition analysis, it was found that at the time equal to twice of tmax (t = 2 X tmax) all 
of the KOH was converted to K2CO3 irrespective of the operating conditions.  Thus, the 
amount of K2CO3 formed by methanol oxidation only up to t = 2 X tmax was needed to be 
determined.  Since we knew the value of tmax for different CO2 concentrations and applied 
loads,  we  calculated  the  amount  of  K2CO3  produced  by  internally  generated  carbon 
dioxide  using  the  data  given  in  Figures  1.2.7  and  1.2.8.    From  Figure  1.2.7,  we 
determined  the  amount  of  K2CO3  formed  at  any  load  after  3.33  hours.    This  value  of 
K2CO3  concentration  was  then  scaled  down  using  the  fact  that  the  variation  of  K2CO3 
concentration with time is linear and the resulting straight line passes through the origin 
as shown in Figure 1.2.8.

This final value represented the fraction of K2CO3 formed by internally generated carbon 
dioxide in the total K2CO3 formed due to overall carbon dioxide poisoning (internally and 
from  the  air  cathode  contamination  when  pure  O2  was  not  used  as  an  oxidant).    The 
results  of  the  quantification  of  the  contribution  of  methanol  oxidation  in  the  net  (total) 
CO2 poisoning in our study are presented in Figure 1.2.9. 

We observe in Figure 1.2.9 that the contribution of methanol oxidation in the total K2CO3 
production decreases with the increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere 
and the applied load.  For the range of operating conditions in our experiments (Load = 1 
to  10Ω  and  %CO2  in  Atmosphere  =  10%  to  50%),  the  contribution  of  the  internally 
generated  carbon  dioxide  to  the  total  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  was  determined  to  be 
between 6% and 14% of the total CO2 poisoning depending if a 90% or 10% O2/CO2 gas 
mixture (at the air cathode) was used (Figure 1.2.9).

Electrolyte Compositional Analysis 

In  the  previous  sections,  we  related  parameters  defining  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  (tmax 
and  Rmax)  with  the  operating  parameters  (CO2  concentration  in  the  air  cathode  oxidant 
stream and applied load).  The variation in a cell performance is primarily attributed to 
the  change  in  the  composition  of  its  electrolyte  with  the  progress  in  poisoning.    In  this 
section, the dependence of the current output of a cell on the compositional changes of its 

18 

electrolyte due to carbon dioxide poisoning is elucidated.  To understand the relationship 
between the cell current and electrolyte composition, we carried out dynamic and static 
analyses of the electrolyte.  

Steady State Electrolyte Testing 

We made mixtures of KOH (aq) and K2CO3 (aq), with concentrations ranging from 0.0 M 
to 1.0 M. Using each mixture as an electrolyte, we measured the cell steady state current 
produced by the fuel cell under a load of 1.3 Ω and operated in a 100% O2 oxidant in the 
air cathode.  The concentration of methanol in the electrolyte was maintained at 2.5 M. 
The  mixture  combinations  used  to  define  the  alkaline  electrolyte,  along  with  the  cell 
current when a load of 1.3 Ω was applied, are listed in Table 1.2.1.

Figure  1.2.10  shows  the  plot  of  cell  steady  state  current  as  a  function  of  the  different 
KOH concentrations in the electrolyte mixture.  It can be seen that decreasing the KOH 
concentration decreases the cell current output, as expected.  But the cell current did not 
drop suddenly until the KOH concentration was reduced from 1 M to about 0.6 M.  The 
cell undergoing CO2 poisoning continues to give the desired current output until the KOH 
concentration in the electrolyte reached a value (≈0.6 M for our fuel cell system).  The 
dependence of the cell current on the KOH concentration explains the sigmoidal current 
vs. time plots obtained for fuel cells being CO2-poisoned (Figure 1.2.1).

Figure  1.2.10:  Variation  of  steady  state  current  output  of  a  fuel  cell,  at  a  load  of  1.3  Ω,  with  the  KOH 
concentration in its electrolyte. Operating atmosphere is maintained at 100% O2

We  called  this  analysis  steady  state  because  in  each  case,  while  measuring  the  steady 
state current, the electrolyte composition across the cell was uniform and the electrolyte 
in the vicinity of the anode and cathode was the same as in the bulk of the cell.  This will 
not be true in the case of a fuel cell undergoing “dynamic” carbon dioxide poisoning due 
to CO2 poisoning by the cathode side, because the majority of K2CO3 would be formed at 
the  cathode.  Therefore,  at  any  time,  the  concentration  of  K2CO3  around  the  cathode 
would be higher than the anode.  Thus, we also carried out “dynamic” or non steady state 
electrolyte  analysis  to  better  understand  the  current  dependence  on  the  compositional 
changes of the electrolyte.   

Dynamic Testing 

In dynamic electrolyte analyses, we started with a fuel cell having 1 M KOH, electrolyte 
and operating in a 70%O2-30%CO2 atmosphere fed by the air cathode to the cell and with 
an  applied  load  of  1.3  Ω.    The  fuel  cell  was  stopped  after  different  time  intervals  of 
operation  and  the  composition  of  the  electrolyte  was  sampled  and  determined  using 
Wrinkler’s method of titration [1].  Table 1.2.2 summarizes the results of the “dynamic” 
electrolyte analysis.

Table 1.2.2 shows the conversion rate of KOH to K2CO3 is higher in the beginning, at a 
value of 1.87 M/hour, as compared to 0.38 M/hour towards the end.  The decrease in the 
conversion rate of KOH can be attributed to the limited mass transfer of the reaction 
product (K2CO3) from the reaction site (cathode) to the bulk.  Current output of the cell 
also changed, accordingly, with the change in KOH concentration.  Figure 1.2.11 shows 
the plot of the current output with KOH concentration observed in dynamic electrolyte 
analysis.  It is compared with a similar plot in Figure 1.2.10 obtained from steady state 
analysis. 

A difference in the results obtained from steady state (static) and dynamic analysis can be 
observed in this plot at lower concentrations of KOH in the electrolyte.  At the same 
composition of electrolyte, the current output given by a cell is higher in dynamic 
analysis than in static.  This can be explained by the non-uniform concentration 
distribution of K2CO3 between the electrodes in a dynamically degrading fuel cell, as 
explained earlier.  Although the overall concentration of K2CO3 was the same in both 
steady state and “dynamic” analysis, K2CO3 concentration in the electrolyte was not 
uniform in the “dynamic” case.  The concentration of KOH around the anode is higher in 
the “dynamic” case.  Since it is the kinetics of methanol oxidation at the anode which is 
lower at higher K2CO3 concentrations [2, 3], the cell current output on the dynamic test is 
higher than in the “static” case.  The difference between results in the “static” and 
dynamic” cases becomes zero if the electrolyte between the electrodes is stirred or if the 
distance between the cathode and anode is reduced.

Electrode Polarization and Electrolyte Conductivity Studies 

The static and dynamic analysis of the electrolyte showed a strong dependence of current 
output of a fuel cell on its electrolyte composition.  The conversion of KOH to K2CO3 by 
carbon  dioxide  poisoning  makes  the  oxidation  of  fuel  at  the  anode  difficult.    This 
conclusion is supported in the potentiostatic polarization curves of the anode and cathode 
for  a  fuel  cell  running  on  1M  KOH  and  0.5M  K2CO3  separately,  as  shown  in  Figure 
1.2.12.  Methanol concentration in both cases was 2.47M.  Figure 1.2.12 suggests that the 
reason  for  low  current  output  given  by  a  cell  in  the  presence  of  K2CO3  is  the  sluggish 
kinetics of methanol fuel oxidation at the anode.  The kinetics of oxygen reduction at the 
cathode remains unchanged for both KOH and K2CO3 electrolytes.

Another  factor  which  may  decrease  the  current  output  of  a  fuel  cell  with  K2CO3  as  the 
electrolyte  is  the  increased  ohmic  loss  (refer  polarization  curves  for  HKU-002C  Fuel

Figure 1.2.13 plots the conductivities of mixtures, tabulated in Table 1.2.1, with the KOH 
concentration in the mixtures.  The dependence of the conductivity of the electrolyte on 
KOH concentration was found to be linear.  Therefore, lesser conductivity at lower mole 
fractions  of  KOH  as  compared  to  K2CO3  in  the  electrolyte  also  lowers  the  overall 
performance of a fuel cell as the carbon dioxide poisoning proliferates in it.

Part 3. Result and discussion of CO2 Poisoning Model 

We developed a model (as described in section 3.2 of “Project Activities”) to accurately 
determine a fuel cell’s performance in a carbon dioxide enriched atmosphere. The model 
is capable of determining the time when the electrolyte should be changed in the cell such 
that the cell’s life and efficiency are optimized. 

For  this  model  to  be  of  any  importance,  it  was  necessary  to  validate  the  model  results 
with the experimental results. For this purpose, we plotted a current vs. time curve of a 
fuel  cell  for  specified  operating  conditions  using  our  model.  Then  under  the  same 
conditions,  we  ran  our  fuel  cells  to  get  the  experimental  data.  We  observed  a  close 
matching  of  the  values  calculated  with  the  model  when  compared  to  the  data  obtained 
experimentally. Figure 1.3.1 and Figure 1.3.2 compare the results of our model with the 
experimental  data  at  operating  conditions  specified  as  (50%O2-50%CO2 and  2.7Ω)  and 
(85%O2-15%CO2 and 5.3Ω), respectively.  

The model created was validated and the results were satisfactory.

Part 4. Evaluation of Polymer Membranes Interfaced with the 
Air Cathode of an AFC 

After understanding the reasons of the CO2 poisoning and developing a methodology and 
a  model  to  evaluate  the  subsequent  degradation,  we  went  ahead  and  evaluated  the  cell 
performances when a polymeric membrane was placed upstream of the air cathode and 
the  alkaline  methanol  fuel  cell  was  fed  with  a  CO2/O2  mixture  as  an  oxidant.    The  gas 
mixture was feed to the cell by the air cathode. We show, herewith, the results obtained 
when Polystyrene and Polyvinyl Pyridine (PVP) membranes were interfaced with the air 
cathode.  

This  procedure  was  followed  for  fuel  cells  with  and  without  the  polymer  membranes.  
Membranes of polyvinyl pyridine (4) and polystyrene (1) were fabricated on a filter paper 
so as to give the membranes required mechanical stability.   

The  polymers  were  dissolved  in  toluene  at  room  temperature  and  then  poured  over 
1.97’’x  2.76’’  filter  paper  for  casting.    The  amount  of  solution  poured  was  directly 
proportional  to  the  required  thickness  of  the  membranes.    The  solvent  was  then 
evaporated in nitrogen until an absolutely dry membrane was obtained, 250 µm thick for 
a polystyrene membrane and 250 thick for a polyvinyl pyridine membrane.   

26 

These membranes were then mounted in the air-cathodes for the electrochemical testing, 
as described earlier.  The air-cathode of one fuel cell was unmasked in the carbon dioxide 
rich  atmosphere  while  the  other  two  were  coupled  with  polyvinyl  pyridine  and 
polystyrene membranes. 

The membranes were intended to be tested for their efficiency in dealing with the carbon 
dioxide  poisoning  problem  in  alkaline  fuel  cells.    To  test  these  polymer  membranes,  a 
similar  experimental  setup  was  used  as  shown  in  Figure  3.2  (Refer  Project  Activities).  
Results of the membrane evaluation are summarized in Figure 1.4.1.  Figure 1.4.1 shows 
that  a  pure  polystyrene  membrane  gives  the  fuel  cell  better  protection  from  CO2 
poisoning than pure PVP membrane. The decay in the current is less severe in the case of 
the  polystyrene  membrane,  as  shown  in  Figure  1.4.1,  than  in  the  case  of  the  PVP 
membrane.  The same observation is corroborated by the plot of the current decay rate vs. 
time in Figure 1.4.2.  The characteristic quantity tmax has gone up from 3.42 hours, in the 
case of a pure PVP membrane, to 6.0 hours, in the case of a polystyrene membrane.  Both 
these quantities are way more than in the case of fuel cell with no membrane where the 
tmax  value  is  just  1.42  hours  (Figure  1.4.2).    Therefore,  placing  a  pure  polystyrene 
membrane in the fuel cell increases the life of the fuel cell by 4.3 times as compared to 
the fuel cell left uncovered in the high CO2 atmosphere.

membrane  and  Pure  Polystyrene  membrane.  The  atmosphere was  maintained  at 70%O2-30%CO2  and  the 
load applied was 1.3 Ω. 

An important thing to note here is that a polystyrene membrane is not enriching the air as 
compared to a PVP membrane.  It is just that the polystyrene membrane we used in our 
experiments was more efficient in cutting down the diffusion of CO2 in the fuel cell as 

27 

compared  to  the  PVP  membrane.    It  could  either  be  because  of  the  thickness  of  the 
polystyrene membrane or because of the denser (high crosslink) structure of it.   

Therefore, it is concluded after doing a series of experiments, that both pure Polystyrene 
and  PVP  membranes  reduce  the  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  problem  by  lowering  the 
diffusion  of  the  gases  (both  O2  and  CO2)  to  the  air  cathode.  The  diffusion  of  any  gas 
through  a  solid  polymer  membrane  would  be  less  due  to  physical  barriers  for  gas 
transport.  The greater the thickness of this physical barrier, the less the diffusion of gases 
across it.

Part  5.    Results  and  Discussion  of  CO2  Poisoning  When  an 
AFC is fueled with “Dirty” Hydrogen. 

The alkaline fuel cells, as described in Chapter 3.3 of the “Project Activities” section of 
the report, operating on air/hydrogen uses an aqueous 2 M KOH electrolyte feed to the 
cell by using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 1 ml/s.  In a typical experiment, a load of 1 
ohm was placed across the cell and the cell was operated on air/pure-H2 for 2000 sec. to 
allow the cell current to stabilize.  We show the variation of the cell current with time due 
to the electrolyte CO2 poisoning due to the fact that “dirty” hydrogen instead of pure H2 

28 

was  fed  to  the  cell  at  the  anode  side  as  a fuel.    “Dirty”  hydrogen  was  defined  as  a  gas 
mixture of O2 and CO2 at different weight percentiles. 

Variation of fuel cell current output with time 

The  current  vs.  time  plots  for  a  fuel  cell  with  and  without  the  polystyrene  membrane 
placed  upstream  of  the  cell  gas  fuel  running  on  5%  CO2/95%  H2  contaminated  “dirty” 
hydrogen for a load of 1 Ω is shown in Figure 1.5.1.  

When CO2 is presented in the H2 stream, we noticed a sharp current decrease at the time 
that the CO2 was injected in the gas stream (0.5 hrs).  The sharp change in cell current is 
more  noticeable  when  a  membrane  is  not  present  and  less  noticeable  when  a  double 
membrane is placed upstream of the cell anode.  These results could be explained as the 
immediate blockage of the anodic membrane due to the formation of potassium carbonate 
at  the  membrane  pores  and  due  to  the  fact  that  a  2  M  KOH  concentration  in  the 
electrolyte was used [1, 2].  A  different  answer  to  the  sharp cell current drop when the 
cell becomes in contact with CO2 is non-specific adsorption of CO2 at the catalytic sites 
and  is  discussed  later  [3].      We  elucidate  in  this  research  program  the  reasons  for  this 
sharp change in cell current, the results are shown in the next sections of this Chapter.  

After this initial sharp drop, the plots exhibit a sigmoid shape which is characteristic of 
the poisoning effect on the cell electrolyte [4]. After that immediate cell current drop due 
to the partial blockage of the anode membrane pores, equilibrium is reached in the pores 
between  the  potassium  carbonate  precipitated  at  the  pores  and  the  electrolyte 
composition.   

The fuel cell starts with an initial current output of 640 - 670 mA which drops rapidly to 
550 – 600 mA as soon as CO2 is introduced into the H2 stream.  As the CO2 poisoning 
proceeds,  the  alkaline  KOH  electrolyte  is  slowly  converted  to  K2CO3  resulting  in  a 
gradual loss in cell output from about 550 mA to 430 mA.  When all the KOH has been 
converted to K2CO3, the current levels out to a constant value of about 430 mA.  For a 
fuel  cell  operating  on  dirty  H2,  complete  conversion  of  the  electrolyte  from  KOH  to 
K2CO3  occurs  within  an  hour  for  a  cell  without  the  polystyrene  membrane.    For  a  fuel 
cell having the protective polystyrene membrane to minimize the CO2 contaminant, the 
CO2  poisoning  process  is  delayed  to  1.5  hours  when  1  coat  membrane  is  used.    The 
process is delayed for 2.5 hours when a thicker 2 coat membrane is used.

Figure  1.5.1.  Comparison  of  the  current  output  vs.  time  for  an  alkaline  fuel  cell  with  and  without 
membranes operating on 5 % CO2 contaminated “dirty” hydrogen as  fuel 

Figure  1.5.1  shows  that  the  fuel  cell  operating  with  the  polystyrene  membrane  on  the 
anode  “dirty”  fuel  side  performed  better  than  the  cell  without  the  membrane.  After  2 
hours of operation, a cell without a membrane has a current output of 440 mA across a 1 
Ω load while a current of 560 mA is measured when a thick membrane is used to separate 
the  H2  from  the  “dirty”  fuel  contaminated  with  CO2.    The  current  is  obtained  in  a  cell 
with an active electrode area of 50 cm2.  In both cases, the initial current decrease when 
we introduce CO2 into the H2 stream and the gradual current decrease in cell output due 
to  the  poisoning  of  the  electrolyte  were  significantly  decreased  by  introducing  the 
polystyrene membrane in the dirty H2 fuel stream. 

In our work on carbon dioxide poisoning studies on air breathing methanol fuel cells, we 
defined two variable parameters, tmax and Rmax, which accurately describe the onset and 
magnitude  of  poisoning  in  AFCs  under  different  operating  conditions  [4].    The  time  at 
which the current decay rate was highest is referred to as tmax and the value of the current 
decay  rate  (dI/dt)  at  this  time  is  Rmax.  A  shorter  tmax  and  a  larger  magnitude  of  Rmax 
correspond  to  a  faster  poisoning  effect.    These  characteristic  quantities  for  the  AFC 
undergoing poisoning in dirty hydrogen are graphically represented in Figure 1.5.2.

CO2 contaminated “dirty” hydrogen as fuel.  Only data points after 0.6 hours (100 seconds after injection 
of the CO2 contaminant) are included in the plot above.  

As can be seen in Figure 1.5.2, Rmax and tmax values for the cell with a membrane indicate 
slower poisoning as compared to a cell with no membrane.  The time of maximum decay, 
i.e. tmax, is shifted from 0.83 hours for an alkaline fuel cell without a membrane to 1.36 
hours  for  a  cell  with  the  1  coat  polystyrene  membrane.    The  current  decay  plot  for  the 
fuel  cell  with  the  2  thicker  coats  of  polystyrene  essentially  shows  no  sharp  peaks 
corresponding to tmax and Rmax, thereby indicating that the poisoning process is very slow. 

Effect of Inert gas on Fuel Cell output 

While operating the AFC, we observed a sharp instantaneous drop in cell current output 
not related to the alkaline electrolyte poisoning occurring as soon as CO2 was introduced 
into the H2 stream.  This drop is reversible and the current returns to its initial value as 
soon  as  the  CO2  is  switched  off  from  the  H2  stream  (Figure  1.5.3).    This  effect  is  also 
observed when nitrogen is introduced into the H2 stream in place of CO2 (Figure 1.5.4).

This sharp drop is unlikely to be due to electrolyte poisoning, i.e. electrolyte conversion 
from KOH to K2CO3, since it is almost instantaneous (within ~ 15 seconds of injecting 
CO2) and the electrolyte has had no time to react with the CO2.  Hence, this effect should 
be present irrespective of whether the electrolyte is pure KOH (zero poisoning) or pure 
K2CO3 (100% poisoning).  To prove this point, fuel cells were run with pure 1 M K2CO3 
as the electrolyte with CO2 (Figure 1.5.5) and N2 (Figure 1.5.6) as the contaminants in the 
H2 fuel stream.  Sharp instantaneous drops in cell current outputs were observed in both 
cases  as  soon  as  the  contaminant  gas  was  introduced  into  the  H2  fuel  stream.    The  cell 
output decrease in both cases was reversible and the current returned to its initial value as 
soon as the contaminant source was shut off. 

This  current  decrease  can  be  attributed  to  competition  for  the  catalyst’s  active  site 
between the fuel, i.e. H2 and the inert gas such as CO2 or N2.  In the case of CO2, two 
additional  factors  result  in  this  initial  decrease  to  be  larger  in  magnitude  than  that  of 
nitrogen.  First, CO2 is more compressible and has a higher boiling point than nitrogen.  
This  would  result  in  a  stronger  adsorption  of  CO2  at  the  catalytic  active  sites  than  N2.  
Secondly, a reverse water gas shift reaction occurs at the catalyst active sites upon CO2 
adsorption  which  results  in  transient  formation  of  CO.    This  CO  formation  poisons  the 
catalytic  active  sites  and  interferes  with  the  normal  electrochemical  reduction  of 
hydrogen.

Chapter 2.  Conclusions and Recommendation  

Part  1. 
Drawbacks 

  Membrane  Permeability  Studies  and  CVVP 

After  testing  a  number  of  polymer  membranes  blended  with  different  oxygen-binding 
complexes, we came to the conclusion that the CVVP Gas Permeation Apparatus is not 
an ideal instrument for studying facilitated transport across membranes due to the large 
pressure  difference  between  the  two  sides  of  the  membrane(  >15  psi).    The  total 
permeability  of  a  gas  through  a  polymer  membrane  is  the  sum  of  its  physical  diffusion 
(1st term of the equation 1), and its chemical diffusion (2nd term of the equation 1). 

PO2 = KD DD + DC CC K / (1 + K  pO2) 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Where, PO2 is the total oxygen permeability, KD is the solubility of oxygen (ln KD = M + 
0.016 Tc, where M is the parameter depending on the polymer (free volume, interactions) 
and Tc is the critical temperature of the gas), DD equals the physical diffusion coefficient 
(DD  =  A  exp(-Ea/RT),  where  A  is  a  constant,  Ea  is  the  activation  energy,  R  is  the  gas 
constant, and T equals the temperature), DC is the chemical diffusion coefficient, CC is the 
saturated  amount  of  specifically absorbed oxygen, K is the oxygen binding equilibrium 
constant, and pO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the upstream side. 

A  large  pressure  difference  between  the  two  sides  of  the  membrane  results  in  a  large 
physical  diffusion  of  the  gases  across  the  membrane  (1st  term  of  the  equation),  which 
might  swamp  the  effect  of  the  selective  facilitated  transport  of  gases  (2nd  term  of  the 
equation).  Hence, selectivity for most of the membranes studied came out to be around 1, 
indicating that the membranes were not as effective in keeping out carbon dioxide under 
the  test  conditions.    To  study  the  permeability  of  the  liquid  membrane  systems  we 
developed, we fabricated a gas permeation apparatus coupled to a Gas Chromatograph or 
an  electrochemical  oxygen  sensor  which  will  not  have  such  a  large  pressure  difference 
between the inlet and the permeate sides of the liquid membrane, hence, allowing us to 
study selectivity in liquid membrane systems.  A schematic diagram of such a system is 
given in Figure2.1.1. 

35 

 

Figure 2.1.1: Schematic representation of the apparatus designed to measure membrane permeability. 

The  electrochemical  testing  of  the  fuel  cell  demonstrated  the  advantages  of  using 
membranes on the upstream flux of air to the air cathode, and the possibility of using air 
instead  of  pure  oxygen  as  an  oxidant  in  the  alkaline  fuel  cell  in  order  to  extend  their 
operational life and lower their maintenance.  

Part  2.  Conclusions  on  the  quantification  study  of  the  CO2 
poisoning  in  alkaline  fuel  cells  (fueled  by  methanol)  under 
accelerated poisoning conditions.  

Quantification of carbon dioxide poisoning in Alkaline Fuel Cells is of great importance 
because  it  enables  us  to  predict  the  current  output  of  a  fuel  cell  running  in  a  carbon 
dioxide enriched atmosphere, when the operating conditions are specified.  In this study, 
a novel method to study and quantify the carbon dioxide poisoning in AFCs, with non-
circulating electrolyte, under accelerated poisoning conditions was developed.   

Two  important  parameters,  i.e.  tmax  and  Rmax,  describing  the  poisoning  affect  under 
accelerated testing conditions, were defined.  A lower value of tmax or a higher value of 
Rmax  would  signify  a  higher  rate  of  carbon  dioxide  poisoning.    With  the  knowledge  of 
these  quantities,  carbon  dioxide  poisoning  can  be  defined,  provided  the  other  operating 
parameters, viz. temperature, electrolyte concentrations etc., remain the same.  Therefore, 
the poisoning was studied and quantified on the basis of tmax and Rmax.  tmax (time at which 
rate  of  current  decay  is  maximum)  was  found  to  decrease  with  the  increase  in 
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and increase with the applied load.  On 
the contrary, Rmax (maximum current decay rate) was found to decrease with the applied 
load and increase with the concentration of carbon dioxide.  At very low concentrations 
(< 2%) tmax alone defined the carbon dioxide poisoning as Rmax became a constant.  For 

36 

the  same  reason,  Rmax  represented  the  poisoning  completely  at  high  carbon  dioxide 
concentrations  (>  60%).    Lower  applied  loads  were  found  to  expedite  the  poisoning  in 
AFCs.    The  reasons  attributed  to  this  are  higher  carbon  dioxide  uptake  by  the  fuel  cell 
and larger production of carbon dioxide by the anodic oxidation of methanol.  A detailed 
study of the contribution of methanol oxidation to the total carbon dioxide poisoning for 
the loads and gas mixture percentile used in the experiment showed that the amount of 
internally  generated  CO2  was  from  6%  to  14%  to  the  total  CO2  (coming  from  the  air 
cathode (reach mixture of O2/CO2) and coming from the methanol reactions internally).  

The effect of electrolyte composition on the current output of the AFC was also studied.  
It was found that a significant decrease in the cell current starts to occur only after about 
60% of KOH has been converted to K2CO3.  This yields important practical information 
about  the  time  to  replenish  the  electrolyte  in  the  AFC  such  that  no  change  in  power 
output takes place.  

Also  the  potentiostatic  polarization  study  of  the  cathode  and  anode  in  the  presence  of 
KOH  (aq)  and  K2CO3  (aq)  electrolytes  was  carried  out.    It  indicated  that  the  primary 
reason for decreases in the cell current during poisoning was sluggish methanol oxidation 
kinetics  at  the  anode  in  the  presence  of  carbonate.    Better  catalyst  systems  which  are 
tolerant  to  carbonate  as  the  electrolyte  may,  in  future,  allow  the  use  of  AFCs  in  air  by 
reducing the carbon dioxide poisoning problem. 

Of  great  importance  will  be  the  evaluation  of  methanol  oxidation  on  different  catalyst 
surfaces  in  order  to  increase  and  speed  up  the  rate  of  the  electrochemical  oxidation  of 
methanol and to decrease and slow down the chemical oxidation of methanol that occurs 
as a parasitic reaction at the cathode (cross over). 

Part 3. Conclusion on Predictive Capability of the Model  

Our  model  predicts  the  variation  of  the  cell  current  with  time  when  the  operating 
conditions  are  specified.    Current  output  of  a  cell  under  such  accelerated  poisoning 
condition  depends  on  various  operating  parameters.    Following  is  the  list  of  such 
operating parameters that affect a fuel cell’s performance in our tests: 

1)  Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. 

2)  Load applied across the fuel cells electrodes. 

3)  Operating temperature. 

4)  Electrolyte (KOH) concentration. 

5)  Methanol concentration in the electrolyte. 

For the sake of simplicity, we modeled the time dependence of cell current on the basis of 
only the first two operating parameters. We showed that this simple model gives accurate 
results  for  the  alkaline  cells  fueled  with  methanol.  It  is  also  belived  that  a  similar 
phenomenological  model  can  be  developed  for  a  fuel  cell  operating  with  H2  fuel.  It  is 

37 

because  H2  fuel  cells  show  a  similar  “sigmoid”  current  decay  curve  as  observed  in 
methanol fueled alkaline cells.  

Therefore,  we  recommend  extending  the  model  to  account  for  the  cell  performances 
when the alkaline fuel cell is being fueled with H2 and the CO2 contamination occurring 
from  the  anode  side.  More  operating  parameters  (as  listed  above)  can  be  taken  into 
account in the modified model. Thus, to deal with the possible complexity of the model 
(more input variables), we intend to develop a neural network based model.  

Part 4.  Air Cathode Membranes Electrochemical Testing  

We recommend in a future work to first evaluate the membranes independently of the cell. 
After selecting the most promising one among the newly designed membranes, we would 
test them in conjugation with the fuel cells. Contaminations from both cathode and anode 
stream would be taken in account.  

We recommend to extend our membrane work to a more exhaustive and systematic work.  
There  are  several  parameters  and  variables  in  the  designing  and  making  of  the 
membranes that were not investigated in this research program due to the time and budget 
limitations. 

Part  5.    CO2  Poisoning  AFC  when  Fuelled  with  “Dirty” 
Hydrogen. 

To separate H2 from a mixture of CO2 and H2 is less challenging than to separate O2 and 
CO2.    The  reason  being,  there  is  a  large  size  difference  between  the  H2  and  the  CO2 
molecule, which is marginal between O2 and CO2 molecules.    

It is evident that interfacing “off the shelf” polystyrene membranes which have intrinsic 
gas selectivity towards H2 significantly improved the performance of the cell running in 
“dirty” hydrogen.  It should be emphasized that the results presented here are preliminary 
and significant further improvement is possible. Additional membrane optimizations like 
thickness, geometry and use of more selective polymers are being done and should yield 
significantly better results. In addition, ceramic based nanoporous membranes can also be 
fabricated and tested for their efficiencies in separating H2 from CO2.

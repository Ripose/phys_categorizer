Observations of enhanced Doppler frequency shift effect of the highly localized 

microwave  backscattering  in  the  upper  hybrid  resonance  are  reported.  The 

experiment is performed at FT-2 tokamak, where a steerable focusing antenna set, 

allowing  off  equatorial  plane  plasma  extraordinary  wave  probing  from  high 

magnetic  field  side,  was  installed.  A  separate  line  less  than  1.5  MHz  wide  and 

shifted  by  up  to  2  MHz  is  routinely  observed  in  the  backscattering  spectrum 

under  condition  of  accessible  upper  hybrid  resonance.  The  enhanced  frequency 

shift is explained by the growth of poloidal wave number of the probing wave in 

the  resonance.  The  new  scheme  for  local  diagnostics  of  fluctuations  poloidal 

rotation based on this effect is proposed. 

 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Investigation  of  tokamak  plasma  poloidal  rotation  attracts  considerable  attention 

nowadays  because  of  the  stabilizing  influence  of  its  inhomogeneity  on  several  types  of 

gradient  instability  and  suppression  of  associated  anomalous  transport  [1].  The  Doppler 

frequency  shift  of  backscattering  (BS)  signal  at  oblique  microwave  plasma  probing  in  the 

presence of cut off (Doppler reflectometry) is often used for diagnosing of poloidal plasma 

velocity  in  magnetic  fusion  devices  [2  –  4].  The  typical  value  of  frequency  shift  of  BS 

microwave  of  several  hundred  kHz  in  these  diagnostics  observed  in  ohmic  discharge  is 

usually  substantially  smaller  than  its  broadening,  which  complicates  interpretation  and 

reduces the accuracy and time resolution of measurements. 

In the present paper a possibility of a drastic increase of the Doppler frequency shift of 

microwave BS signal in toroidal devices, based on the upper hybrid resonance (UHR) BS is 

demonstrated  experimentally.  The  UHR  BS  or  enhanced  scattering  [5]  utilizes  for  local 

diagnostics of small-scale plasma fluctuations the growth of wave vector and electric field of 

the probing extraordinary (X-mode) wave in the UHR, where condition

magnetic  field  on  the  major  radius  R   (see  Fig.  2),  the  large  probing  wave  vector, 

perpendicular to the UHR surface, has a finite projection onto the poloidal direction. In the

2. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

In  this  paper,  the  first  observations  of  the  giant  Doppler  frequency  shift  effect  of  the 

highly localized microwave BS in the UHR are reported. The experiment was performed at 

small research FT-2 tokamak possessing major radius  R  = 55 cm and limiter’s radius  a  = 

7.9 cm. The measurements were carried out at toroidal field

32  kA  and  density  in  range:  3.5· 1019  m-3  < 

en   <  4.5· 1019  m-3.  Typical  discharge  duration 

was  90  ms.  The  microwave  BS  experiment  was  performed  with  a  new  steerable  focusing 

double antennae set, shown schematically in Fig. 2, allowing off equatorial plane plasma X-

mode probing from high magnetic field side. The maximal vertical displacement of antennae 

center  is 

ay   =  ±2  cm,  whereas  the  diameter  of  the  wave  beam  at  the  position  of  UHR,  as 

measured in vacuum is 1.5 – 1.7 cm, depending on the probing frequency. The coupling of 

emitting  and  receiving  antennae  is  less  than  -35  dB.  The  probing  was  performed  at  power 

level of 20 mW in the frequency range 53 – 69 GHz providing UHR position scanning from 

R   »

  60  cm  to  63  cm.  The  BS  signal  was  analyzed  with  quadrature  scheme,  which  allows 

measurements  of  BS  signal  phase  and  amplitude,  as  well  as  determination  of  BS  power 

spectra. Just after the new antennae set installation, a separate line shifted by up to 2 MHz 

became reliably observable in the BS spectrum under condition of accessible UHR. The BS 

power  spectrum  possessing  the  highest  (2  MHz)  shift,  observed  at  +2  cm  antenna  vertical 

displacement,  is  shown  in  Fig.  3(a)  (

sf –  scattering  frequency).  The  amplitude  of  BS  line

spectrum observed in equatorial plane 

and  possessing  no  shift  is  shown  in 

Fig.  3(b).  As  it  is  seen  the  width  of 

this  spectrum  is  smaller  than  in  the  case  of  Fig.  3(a),  which  is  in  agreement  with  the 

estimation (4). For comparison the BS spectrum observed with the same antenna set, shifted 

by +2 cm from equatorial plane, under conditions when the UHR is not accessible is shown 

in Fig. 3(c). This spectrum, which, in fact, corresponds to Doppler reflectometry with tilting 

angle of 14(cid:176) , is only slightly shifted. Its frequency shift can be estimated with poor accuracy 

at the level of 100 kHz. 

The  linear  frequency  shift  proportionality  to  the  displacement  of  BS  point  from  the 

equatorial plane is confirmed in a special experiment in which the antennae vertical position

to 

discharge  (see  Fig.  4)  at  different 

radial  UHR  positions  ( R =  60.1  cm  – 

 

circles;  61.7  cm  –  triangles).  As  it  is 

seen,  the  frequency  shift  of  the  BS 

satellite  changes  sign,  when 

the 

antennae  set  crosses  the  equatorial  plane.  The  spectrum  width  is  minimal  at  the  equatorial 

plane  probing  and  increases  with  absolute  value  of  antennae  vertical  displasement  in 

reasonable agreement with the estimation (4), predicting linear growth. 

As  it  is  shown  in  Fig.  5  the 

UHR  BS  satellite  frequency  shift 

 

appears to be strongly dependent on 

the probing frequency. It is positive

  =  -0.50)).  This  expression  is  obtained  neglecting  the  toroidal  rotation 

contribution, which should not be large in FT-2 ohmic discharge at the safty factor q(a)=5. 

The  theoreticaly  predicted  value  of  radial  electric  field  in  this  region  is  negative,  which 

corresponds  to  the  dominance  of  ion  channel  of  particle  losses.  The  dependence  of 

neoclassical  poloidal  rotation  velocity  on  major  radius,  determined  using  experimental  ion 

temperature  and  density  profiles  is  also  shown  in  Fig.  6.  As  it  is  seen,  in  the  inner  plasma 

region  the  neoclassical  curve  is  close  to  the  experimental  values.  The  poloidal  velocity 

decreases by a factor 2.7 at  R  »

 61.5 cm, but at the plasma edge the experimental value of 

the poloidal velocity increases again towards last closed field surface (LCFS) in agreement 

with  theoretical  expectations.  In  the  nearest  vicinity  of  LCFS,  at  R   »

  62.4  cm  the  rotation 

velocity quickly decreases and changes sign in the edge region, where it is natural to expect 

positive plasma electric field, caused by fast electron losses along open magnetic field lines. 

It is important to note that the calculated values of electron diamagnetic drift velocity all 

over  the  measurements  region  exceed  the  experimental  values  of  fluctuations  poloidal 

rotation velocity by a factor of 3 – 5. It means that the contribution of the fluctuation phase 

velocity 

phV   to  the  rotation,  if  any,  is  much  smaller  than  one  could  expect  for  the  electron 

drift eigen mode, possessing the spatial scale much smaller than ion Larmor radius. Based on 

this result we can conclude that the major part of the observed UHR BS signal is produced by 

non resonant fluctuations, probably resulted from nonlinear evolution of ion drift turbulence 

and  its  cascading  to  small  scales.  This  conclusion  is  quite  natural  also  because  the 

fluctuations producing BS in the UHR should possess radial wave number much higher than 

the poloidal one and thus are not similar to the electron drift wave eigen-modes [1]. 

3. CONCLUSIONS 

The  giant  Doppler  frequency  shift  is  observed  in  the  off  equatorial  plane  UHR  BS 

experiment at FT-2 tokamak in agreement with theoretical predictions. The enhancement of 

the  BS  signal  frequency  shift  is  explained  by  growth  of  poloidal  wave  number  of  probing 

wave  in  the  UHR,  which  should  occur  in  toroidal  devises,  where  the  UHR  and  magnetic 

surfaces do not coincide and thus the huge UHR wave vector, which is perpendicular to the 

UHR  surface,  have  a  big  projection  onto  poloidal  direction.  The  fluctuation’s  poloidal 

velocity  estimated  from  the  frequency  shift  is  close  to  the  neoclassical  theory  expectations 

and  much  smaller  than  electron  diamagnetic  drift  velosity.  The  last  result  favores  the 

conclusion that the observed frequency shift is rather associated with the plasma 

E BV ·

 drift 

flow  than  with  fluctuation  phase  velocity,  which  should  be  checked  by  spectroscopic  and 

Doppler reflectometry measurements in preparation now. 

The  found  robust  effect  has  a  potential  for  development  of  a  new  scheme  for  precise 

diagnostics of poloidal rotation of plasma fluctuations in tokamaks and stellarators possessing 

high spatial and temporal resolution.

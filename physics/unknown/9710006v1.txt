Abstract

It is well known that short-time expansions of heat kernels correlate to for-
It is also well known
mal high-frequency expansions of spectral densities.
that the latter expansions are generally not literally true beyond the ﬁrst
term. However, the terms in the heat-kernel expansion correspond rigorously
to quantities called Riesz means of the spectral expansion, which damp out
oscillations in the spectral density at high frequencies by dint of performing
an average over the density at all lower frequencies. In general, a change of
variables leads to new Riesz means that contain diﬀerent information from the
old ones. In particular, for the standard second-order elliptic operators, Riesz
means with respect to the square root of the spectral parameter correspond to
terms in the asymptotics of elliptic and hyperbolic Green functions associated
with the operator, and these quantities contain “nonlocal” information not
contained in the usual Riesz means and their correlates in the heat kernel.
Here the relationship between these two sets of Riesz means is worked out
in detail; this involves just classical one-dimensional analysis and calculation,
with no substantive input from spectral theory or quantum ﬁeld theory. This
work provides a general framework for calculations that are often carried out
piecemeal (and without precise understanding of their rigorous meaning) in
the physics literature.

I. PHYSICAL MOTIVATION

Let H be a positive, self-adjoint, elliptic, second-order partial diﬀerential operator. For
temporary expository simplicity, assume that H has purely discrete spectrum, with eigen-
values λn and normalized eigenfunctions φn(x). Quantum ﬁeld theorists, especially those
working in curved space, are accustomed to calculating (1) the heat kernel,

(3)

(2) the Wightman function,

K(t, x, y) =

which determines the vacuum energy density of a quantized ﬁeld in a static space-time
background. Of greatest interest are the behaviors of these functions with y = x (either
evaluated pointwise, or integrated over the whole spatial manifold) in the limit t

0.

Roughly speaking, the small-t asymptotics of both (1) and (2) are determined by the
large-λ (ultraviolet) asymptotics of the density of eigenvalues and of the eigenfunctions.
However, there is a major diﬀerence between the heat kernel and the Wightman function in
this regard. All the coeﬃcients bs(x) in the heat-kernel expansion

(m = dimension) are locally determined by the coeﬃcient functions in the diﬀerential oper-
ator H at the point x. The same is true of the leading, singular terms in an expansion of
W (t, x, y), which are removed by renormalization; the ﬁnite residue, however, is a nonlocal
functional of the coeﬃcients in H, containing information about, for example, the global
structure of the manifold — this is what makes vacuum energy interesting and nontrivial. It
follows that this nonlocal information is somehow contained in the ultraviolet asymptotics
of the spectrum, although it is lost in passing (pointwise) to K(t, x, x). The Wightman
function is more typical of Green functions associated with H; the striking and somewhat
mysterious thing is how special the heat kernel is.

The primary purpose of this paper is to point out that many of the facts of this subject
have nothing to do speciﬁcally with partial diﬀerential operators (much less with quantum
ﬁeld theory). Rather, they result from some classical real analysis (in one dimension) con-
cerning the summability of series and integrals, much of which was developed by M. Riesz
and G. H. Hardy early in the twentieth century. One consequence is that many formal rela-
tionships between the asymptotic expansions of Green functions and those of the associated
spectral measures, and between the asymptotic expansion of one Green function and that of
another, can be worked out in the abstract without reference to the detailed spectral theory
of any particular operator. The same is true, qualitatively, of the limitations of such rela-
tionships: The rigorous asymptotic expansion of a heat kernel suggests a formal asymptotic
expansion of an associated spectral measure, but the latter is usually valid only in some
averaged sense. It can be translated into rigorous statements about the Riesz means of the

2

measure. The construction of Riesz means not only washes out oscillations in the measure
at the ultraviolet end, but also incorporates some information about the measure at small or
moderate values of λ. The information contained in a Riesz mean depends on the variable
of integration; for example, the Riesz means with respect to √λ contain more information
than those with respect to λ. The diﬀerence between the nonlocal asymptotics of the Wight-
man function and the local asymptotics of the heat kernel is, at root, an example of this
phenomenon.

These relationships can be made yet more precise by introducing some concepts from

distribution theory1,2.

II. SURVEY OF THE PHENOMENA

To provide a concrete context for the later sections of the paper, we display here some
Green functions and asymptotic expansions associated with a constant-coeﬃcient diﬀerential
operator in one dimension. (The later sections are logically independent of this one and much
more general).

Here and in Sections VI and VII we use as a surrogate for the Wightman function a
technically simpler Green function that we call the cylinder kernel. This is the integral
kernel T (t, x, y) of the operator e−

t√H, and it is related to the elliptic equation

in the same way that the heat kernel (the integral kernel of e−
equation

tH ) is related to the parabolic

Because of the slow decay of the basic kernel in its role as image term, the expansion diﬀers

from (12) beyond the leading O(t−

the length, x + y, of a path between the two arguments that bounces oﬀ the endpoint3).

In comparison with (20) and (21), the leading terms of (26) and (27) have adjusted to reﬂect
the smaller size of the manifold, and the new second (t-independent) terms are the eﬀect of
the boundary. The minus sign on those terms distinguishes the Dirichlet boundary condition
from the Neumann. (A less trivial diﬀerential operator would yield more complicated ex-
pansions, with higher-order terms exhibiting an interaction between the boundary condition
and the coeﬃcients (potential, curvature) (see Ref. 5).)

It is worth noting that the most important dependence of (21) or (27) on the size of
(Indeed,
the manifold comes from the integration, not from the form of the integrand.
the L-dependence of (18) and (24) as written is downright misleading in this respect.) In
ignorance of both the size of
and the nature and location of any boundaries, knowledge
of the O(t) term in T (t, x, x) on a small interval of x would be a rather useless tool for the
inverse problem.

III. NOTATION AND BASIC FORMULAS

The basic references for this section and much of the next are Hardy6–8 and H¨orman-

der9,10. (The formulations given here are somewhat new, however.)
Let f (λ) be a function of locally bounded variation on [0,

) such that

f (0) = 0.

∞

Typically, f will be deﬁned as a Stieltjes integral

f (λ) =

a(σ) dµ(σ),

λ

0
Z

where µ(λ) is another function of the same kind, and a(λ) is (say) a continuous function.
By convention we take functions of locally bounded variation to be continuous from the left:

the integral (29) is summable by Riesz means of order α. Eq. (34) may be used to deﬁne
all these things for any α

integer α.

From this is proved Hardy’s ﬁrst theorem of consistency:

If an integral (29) is summable by Riesz means of order α0 , then it is
summable to the same value of means of order α for any α
α0 . In
particular, if the integral is convergent, then it is summable by means
of any order α

The proof is similar to that of (45), below.

Although Riesz and Hardy were primarily interested in deﬁning numerical values for non-
convergent series and integrals, our concern (following H¨ormander) is to use Riesz means as
a way of organizing the asymptotic information contained in a function, without interference
from small-scale ﬂuctuations. Thus we are more interested in the Riesz means themselves
than in the Riesz limits.

IV. THE RELATION BETWEEN MEANS WITH RESPECT TO DIFFERENT
VARIABLES

Let ω be related to λ by

λ = ωk

(k > 0, k

= 1).

We are primarily interested in the cases k = 2 and k = 1
2. (More generally, one could treat
two variables related by any orientation-preserving diﬀeomorphism of [0,
).) We write σ
and τ as integration variables corresponding to λ and ω respectively — hence σ = τ k. We
let

λf can be expressed in terms of the mean Rα

Adding R1 and R2 , one obtains the formula (43) to be proved.

As a corollary we see:

If an integral (29) is summable by αth-order Riesz means with respect
to λ, then it is summable to the same value by αth means with respect
to ω, and conversely.

and interchanges λ and ω. It suﬃces, since Riesz means are linear, to consider the special
cases (i) where the Riesz limit in question is 0, and (ii) where f (λ) = C, a constant, for all
λ
= 0. The latter case is trivial since all Riesz means and hence all Riesz limits are equal
to C. In case (i), we are given that Rα
; that is, for every ε > 0 there is a
0 as σ
τ f

A generalization of this argument (due to Riesz and Hardy6,7) proves the second theorem
of consistency (for α integer): Let λ = g(ω), where g is an increasing function in C ∞(IR+),
g(0) = 0, g(

Then (45) holds, except possibly for the clause “and conversely”. Conditions suﬃcient
together to guarantee (46) (given the other conditions on g) are

(46)

(47)

g(ω) = O(ω∆)

for some ∆ > 0

and

g(ω) is given (for suﬃciently large ω) by an explicit, ﬁnite formula
involving the logarithmic and exponential functions, real constants,
and (real, ﬁnite) elementary algebraic operations.

The signiﬁcance of this theorem is clearer in the following imprecise paraphrase: (1) If ω
, but more slowly than λ, then λ-summability implies ω-summability, provided
increases to
that the increase of ω with λ is suﬃciently “steady” — that is, derivatives of g must not
oscillate so as to disrupt (46). (2) Under those conditions, ω-summability does not ensure
λ-summability — e.g., an integral Rα-summable with respect to ω may not be Rα-summable
eω. However, if the rates of increase of λ and ω diﬀer only by a power,
with respect to λ
then the two types of summability are coextensive.

This is obtained from (36) by expanding the factor (1
the binomial theorem. In view of (40), (49) has the converse part of (45) as a corollary.
More signiﬁcantly, the absence of an integral in (49) as compared with (43) means that the
λf is entirely determined by the asymptotic behavior
asymptotic (λ
of Rβ
ωf , a conclusion which we shall reach independently below. We shall see also that the
converse is false: The asymptotic behavior of Rα
ωf is aﬀected by the values of f at small
λ, in a way that is not captured by the asymptotic behavior of Rβ
λf for any β, no matter
how large. Thus it is really essential in (49) that k is an integer (so that the binomial series
terminates).

Since µ is of locally bounded variation, it is bounded as λ

λ µ = O(λα) at
small λ (see Remark at end of Sec. V), so Rα
λ is bounded there. Thus there is no problem
with convergence at the lower limit of the integral in (51), as a whole. However, some of
the individual terms in (50), and hence the remainder term by itself, will be singular as
τ
m. Therefore, for each integral encountered when (50) is substituted into (51),
one must choose an appropriate lower limit of integration, τ0 . Let R be the part of the
σ µ(τ 2) for small τ , and
total integral thereby omitted; thus the integrand of R equals J 1
is redeﬁned as τ increases — in such a way that R is convergent and depends on ω only

no logarithms are “created” by the integration as in (54).) Since it must be possible to

V. THE MEANS OF A STIELTJES INTEGRAL IN TERMS OF THE MEANS OF

VI. HEAT KERNELS (LAPLACE TRANSFORMS) AND RIESZ MEANS

The standard heat kernel of a second-order operator has a natural association with the
variable we have called λ, while the cylinder kernel (introduced in Sec. II) is associated
in the same way with the variable ω. The terms in the asymptotic expansions of these
Green functions are in direct correspondence with those in the asymptotic expansions of the
associated Riesz means. However, it is instructive to try to calculate each Green function in
terms of the “wrong” variable, to observe how information gets lost, or needs to be resupplied,
in passing from one quantity to another. Therefore, this section divides naturally into four
parts.

we shall demonstrate detailed equivalence of (76) with (50).

In spectral theory, (75) has a number of possible interpretations. Let H be a positive,
elliptic, second-order diﬀerential operator on an m-dimensional manifold. Then: (1) If the
manifold is compact, K may be the integrated “trace” of the heat kernel of H, µ(λ) being
the number of eigenvalues less than or equal to λ. (2) K may be the diagonal value of the
heat kernel at a point x, µ(λ)
Eλ(x, x) being the diagonal value of the spectral function
(integral kernel of the spectral projection). In this case one knows that bs = 0 if s is odd.
(3) K may be the diagonal value of some spatial derivative of the heat kernel, µ being the
corresponding derivative of the spectral function. (In this case, m in (76) depends on the
order of the derivative as well as on the dimension.) If m = 1, µ is a Titchmarsh-Kodaira
spectral measure. (4) K = K(t, x, y) may be the full heat kernel (oﬀ-diagonal), µ being the
full spectral function.

Remark: When m

s is even, aαs is zero for small α, and the nonzero value for large α
(hence the nonzero value of bs) may be regarded as a constant of integration encountered in
the passage from a low-order Riesz mean to a higher-order one. A case of particular interest
is the local diagonal value of the heat kernel, for which bs = 0 when s is odd but generally
= 0 for s even. Here there is an essential diﬀerence between m even and m odd. If m
bs 6
is odd, then a0s is 0 for odd s and nonzero for even s, and the constants of integration are
also 0. If m is even, then a0s = 0 for all s > m, and the nonzero values of bs for s > m,
s even, come entirely from constants of integration. This dimensional property of a0s is
reﬂected in the poles of the zeta function.11,12

in (120) do not converge at the lower limit, although the integral as a whole is convergent.
Consequently, we must deal with integrals of the form

It can be seen that the integrals give rise to terms of the form (98), but without the restriction
that s
m be odd in the logarithmic terms. Moreover, the contribution from λ < 1 is analytic,
hence can be expanded as a series of positive integral powers of t with unknown coeﬃcients.

From (58) and (99)–(100), we would expect the coeﬃcient of t−
if s
m is odd. Therefore, we anticipate conspiracies among
the coeﬃcients in (119) which will eliminate both the logarithms and the undeterminable
coeﬃcients when s

m is even. Let us verify this for the case m = 1, α = 3:

(Here the ﬁrst four terms come from integrating all terms in the middle member involving ω
to a nonnegative power. To represent accurately the integral over small ω of the remaining
terms, it has been necessary to go back to the ﬁrst member and to note that the quantity
in square brackets there is O(ω6) by virtue of (120) and (73). Of the terms involving
7/2, the ﬁrst two have already been accounted for in the explicit integrations, and the

The bothersome term at the end could be removed by taking ω0 → ∞
. Now this term and
tω in (123)
its predecessor can be traced to the ﬁrst two terms in a Taylor expansion of e−
with n = 3. In analogy to the argument leading from (55) to (57), we may transfer this part
of the integral from the high-ω account to the low-ω account; this simply amounts to adding
something to the “O(ω6)” term, and the same cancellation of O(t2) terms just observed for
that term will occur for this other contribution as well. Thus we have derived the expected

Summary: The coeﬃcients bs in the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel, K(t),
are in one-to-one correspondence with the “diagonal” coeﬃcients ass in the asymptotic

λµ. The nondiagonal coeﬃcients, aαs,
in the expansions of the Rα
λµ diﬀer only by numerical factors from the ass; because these
factors may vanish, it is not possible to express ass in terms of aαs if α is too small. Similarly,
the coeﬃcients es and fs in the expansion of the cylinder kernel, T (t), are in one-to-one
correspondence with the diagonal coeﬃcients css and dss in the expansions of the Riesz
means with respect to ω, Rs
ωµ. The connection in this case involves a two-termed equation,
(111). Again the cαs and dαs can be expressed in terms of the css and dss, but not conversely
if α is too small. Finally, and perhaps most signiﬁcantly, the css and dss (or the es and fs)
contain information which is not contained in the ass (or the bs) (but not conversely). The
css for s
m odd and positive are “new spectral invariants” independent of the ass . In the
case of the heat and cylinder kernels, the css contain nonlocal geometrical information, while
the ass are strictly local.

These relations obviously induce similar relations between bs and (es, fs). The quantities css
(s
m odd and positive) summarize the information contained in the asymptotics of T but
not in that of K.

−

In the context of spectral theory of diﬀerential operators, the quantities bs , es , fs are
more accessible to calculation, because K(t) and T (t) are Green functions or their traces,
but ass , css , dss are more fundamental, since µ(λ) represents a spectral decomposition (the
integral kernel of the spectral projections in the local case, the density of eigenvalues in the
traced case). We expect that further work will bring the technically more diﬃcult case of the
Wightman function (and other Green functions of wave equations) into the same picture.

This picture clariﬁes and uniﬁes results that have appeared in the literature piecemeal
or imprecisely. One sees that the small-t expansion of K is not related in a one-to-one
way with the formal large-λ expansion of µ (i.e., the a0s); rather, the heat coeﬃcients bs
can involve constants of integration from the Riesz averaging of µ over small λ. This ex-
plains how the formal expansion of µ (and the associated zeta-function poles) can be strik-
ingly diﬀerent in even and odd dimensions, while the heat-kernel expansion is notoriously
dimension-independent. (See Remark below (84).) Further constants of integration appear
in the passage from λ-means to ω-means; these carry nonlocal geometrical information in
the spectral context. They are intimately related to the potential appearance of logarithmic
terms (fs, dss). On the other hand, the numerical relationships among the various series are
independent of the spectral application; in particular, they will be universal for all (positive,
elliptic) operators of a given order and dimension. (Only order 2 has been treated here.)

To conclude, we apply some of these formulas to the simple examples studied in Sec. II
and compare the results to the known spectral densities for those cases. In these examples,
m = 1.

One observes that (139) and (145)–(146) are related precisely as prescribed in (133)–(137).
Again, (145)–(146) could be established directly from (128a) and (141) by integration by
parts. (The earnest student who actually attempts these tedious exercises will ﬁnd that
certain endpoint terms that vanished in the previous case will produce the nonvanishing css
in this case.) The present case, however, is more easily treated by (128b).

Let us consider only the Dirichlet boundary condition. The heat-kernel asymptotics, and
hence the λ-means ass , are again trivial. The eﬀect of the boundary is seen (as dictated by
(133)) only in the even-order coeﬃcients of the cylinder kernel and the associated ω-means:

The calculation of Riesz means leads to sums that can be regarded as trapezoidal-rule
approximations to integrals of the types already considered. Therefore, the new features of
this case can be sought in the Euler–Maclaurin formula (Ref. 13, Sec. 1.8) for the diﬀerence
between the sum and the integral. The terms in that formula involve only the odd-order
derivatives of the integrand at the endpoints of the interval. In an integral such as (128a)
τ /ω)s to all relevant orders will vanish at
or (142), the derivatives of the factor such as (1

The novel feature of this case is that the trace (26) of the heat kernel contains a nontrivial
term, of order t0, and a similar term appears in the trace (27) of the cylinder kernel. The

The reader will have noted that in most of these instances it is easier to obtain the
Riesz means from the Green functions via (129)–(132) and Section II than to calculate the
Riesz means directly, even though the spectral functions are known exactly.
(Since the
direct calculations are merely consistency checks for us, we have carried out some of the
calculations only far enough to demonstrate the matching of the ﬁrst few terms, rather than
constructing complete proofs. The claims in this section are to be understood in that spirit.)

Most of this paper was written during the early 1980s when I was supported by the
National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY79–15229. During the earliest stage I
enjoyed the hospitality of the Institute for Theoretical Physics (University of California at
Santa Barbara). At both ITP and Texas A&M University I was able to discuss the ideas
in seminars and receive helpful comments from members of the audiences, including John
Cardy, David Gurarie, and especially Robert Gustafson, who has supplied a direct proof
of the identity (67) to which I had been led indirectly. Michael Taylor suggested that the
“cylinder kernel” of a diﬀerential operator H is an object worthy of study. Above all, I
am grateful to Ricardo Estrada, who reawakened my interest in this project after it lay
dormant for ten years, and advanced it in a diﬀerent direction in our joint paper.1 Any
integral or special-function identity cited above without a reference probably came from the
indispensable Ref. 15.

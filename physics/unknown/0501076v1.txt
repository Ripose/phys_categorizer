We study the existence and stability of cnoidal periodic wave arrays propagating in 

uniform quadratic nonlinear media and discover that they become completely stable 

above  a  threshold  light  intensity.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first 

example  in  physics  of  completely  stable  periodic  wave  patterns  propagating  in 

conservative uniform media supporting bright solitons.

Multiple-peaked  periodic  wave  structures  play  a  central  role  in  Nature  [1-6]. 

They are at the core of the development of modulational instabilities and turbulences 

in nonlinear systems, the eigenmodes of mechanical, molecular and electrical chains, 

Bloch  waves  in  solid-state  physics,  the  formation  of  matrices  of  ultracold  atoms  or 

trapped  Bose-Einstein  condensates,  or  the  creation  of  light-induced  reconfigurable 

photonic  lattices.  For  example,  self-sustained  periodic  wave  structures  find 

applications  in  Langmuir  plasma  waves  [5,7],  deep-water  gravity  waves  [4,8],  pulse 

trains in optical fibers [1-3,9], reconfigurable beam arrays in photorefractive crystals 

[6,10],  matter  waves  in  trapped  Bose-Einstein  condensates  [11],  or  synchronously 

pumped  optical  parametric  oscillators  [12],  to  mention  a  few.  By  and  large,  the 

concept  of  periodic  nonlinear  waves  allows  to  bridge  the  gap  between  localized 

solitons and linear harmonic or continuous waves [1,2]. 

However, to date stable periodic patterns are only known to occur in physical 

settings  modeled  by  self-defocusing  nonlinearities [3-5,7,8,13], in systems trapped by

external  potentials,  like  Bose-Einstein  condensates  in  periodical  traps  [11],  or  in 

dissipative  systems,  like  optical  cavities.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  all  previous 

examples  of  periodic  (or  cnoidal)  waves  in  conservative  uniform  medium  with  self-

focusing nonlinearity supporting bright solitons are dynamically unstable. Therefore, 

albeit  some  strategies  to  reduce  the  instability  strength  have  been  put  forward 

recently,  no  examples  of  completely  stable  cnoidal  waves  are  known  in  self-focusing 

media. 

In this Letter we report the existence of the first known example of such stable 

cnoidal wave families. We discovered them in quadratic nonlinear media. Thus, they 

are  multicolored  and  sustained  by  nonlinear  cross-phase-modulations  induced  in 

parametric wave-mixing processes. Similar to the cnoidal waves existing, e.g., in self-

focusing  cubic  nonlinear  media,  many  cnoidal  waves  supported  by  quadratic 

nonlinearities  suffer  from  modulational  instabilities  and  thus  self-destroy.  However, 

we  found  that  above  a  threshold  field  intensity  the  growth  rate  of  the  instabilities 

that  affect  so-called  cn-type  cnoidal  waves  suddenly  vanishes  completely,  thus 

turning  the  cn-waves  totally  stable.  Such  unconditional  stability  was  revealed  by  a 

mathematical  formalism  put  forward  to  elucidate  the  linear  stability  of  the  cnoidal 

wave solutions, and was confirmed by direct numerical simulations in the presence of 

multiplicative broadband random initial perturbations. 

Here  we  address  the  case  of  spatial  light  trapping  in  one-dimensional  phase-

matched second-harmonic generation, where a fundamental frequency wave (FF) and 

its  second-harmonic  (SH)  interact  with  each  other,  but  the  concept  is  expected  to 

hold  in  more  general  physical  geometries  and  settings.  The  propagation  of  the 

corresponding slowly-varying envelopes under conditions for non-critical type I phase-

matching is described by the system of reduced equations [14-16]

to obtain periodic waves with different periods from a given family, we selected  0r  is 
such  way  that  the  period  T   equals  to  2π ,  and  vary  the  propagation  constant. 

Particular examples of cnoidal wave solutions of Eqs. (1) can be obtained analytically 

with the aid of Hamiltonian formalisms, direct substitution, and Lie group techniques 

[17]. However, whole families of solutions must be obtained numerically [18]. Here we 

concentrate on two simplest types of cnoidal waves defined by their dn- and cn-type 

asymptotical  shapes  in  the  limit 

β (cid:21) .  Examples  of  the  dispersion  diagrams  and 

1

profiles  of  such  dn-  and  cn-type  waves  are  shown  in  Figs.  1(a)-1(c)  and  2(a)-2(c), 

respectively. Waves of cn- and dn-types exist for propagation constant values above a 

b
cut-off.  For  cn-waves  the  cut-off  is  given  by  1
b = −

β

decreases  with  increase  of  the  phase  mismatch,  and  approaches 

b

β= −

/ 2

  as 

β → −∞  [18]. In the high-energy, or high-localization limit, cn-type waves transform 

into arrays of out-of-phase bright solitons, while dn-type waves transform into arrays 

of  in-phase  bright  solitons.  In  the  low  energy  limit,  dn-type  waves  transform  into 

plane  waves,  whereas  cn-type  waves  transform  either  into  plane  or  small  amplitude 

harmonic  waves  depending  on  the  phase  mismatch  sign.  Numerical  simulations 

indicate  that  many  of  the  stationary  solutions,  including  all  the  solutions  obtained 

analytically [17], destabilize and decay [18], but the stability properties of the entire 

families  is  unknown.  However,  the  mathematical  techniques  commonly  used  to 

elucidate  the  linear  stability  of  localized  single  soliton  solutions  (see  [16])  are 

inapplicable to the cnoidal waves. Therefore, here we elaborate a new mathematical 

formalism put forward to elucidate the stability of such solutions for different degrees 

of localization. We thus seek for perturbed solutions of Eqs. (1) in the form:

.  Our  method 

is 

advantageous  in  comparison  with  standard  eigenvalue  solvers  since  only  8

8×  

matrices  are  required  for  construction  of  areas  of  existence  of  finite  perturbations. 

The only time consuming part is the calculation of the translation matrix 

( )ηP

. 

First  we  apply  the  method  to  dn-waves.  We  searched  for  all  types  of 

perturbations  with  general  complex  growth  rates,  and  scanned  the  whole  δ -plane 

with fine meshes (typically the step in the modulus of  δ  was  0.001 and the step in 

the  phase  was 

π

/1000

).  For  periodic  waves  the  areas  of  existence  of  finite 

perturbations have a band structure. Typical areas of existence of perturbations with 

purely  imaginary  δ   are  shown  in  Fig.  1(d)  for 

β = .  Such  areas  overlap  with  the 

0

regions where perturbations exhibit a harmful real growth rate. This is clearly seen in 

Fig.  1(e)  that  shows  the  areas  of  existence  of  finite  perturbations  corresponding  to 

real  δ  at 

β = . The corresponding instability is most pronounced at the low-energy 

0

limit, when  1b  approaches cut-off and the dn-wave transforms into a plane wave, and 
it is asymptotically suppressed in the high-energy limit, when the dn-wave transforms 

into an array of in-phase bright solitons. We did not find perturbations with complex 

δ   (corresponding  to  oscillatory  instabilities)  in  the  case  of  dn-waves.  The  typical 

destabilization  of  a  perturbed  dn-wave  is  shown  in  Fig.  1(f).  The  instability  of  dn-

wave always manifests as fusion of neighboring peaks. Similar results were obtained 

for  all  values  of  the  propagation  constant  at  different  phase-mismatches  inside  the 

interval  investigated,  namely 

− ≤ ≤ .  Therefore  we  conclude  that  the  entire 

20

20

β

families of multicolored dn-waves are unstable. 

Next we consider cn-waves. On intuitive grounds, such waves are expected to 

be more robust than the dn-waves because of the alternating phase of the FF, hence 

neighboring peaks might tend to repel each other and thus a stable balance might be 

possible.  Still,  such  is  not  the  case,  e.g.,  in  self-focusing  cubic  Kerr-type  nonlinear 

media where the cn-waves are unstable, too. The central result of this Letter is that 

such  stable  balance  does  occur  with  multicolor  cn-waves,  as  shown  in  Figs  2(e)-(g). 

The intrinsically saturable nature of quadratic nonlinearities appears to be important 

to  such  stabilization,  thus  similar  results  might  occur  in  other  systems  modeled  by 

saturable nonlinearities. The areas of existence of finite perturbations with imaginary 

 

5

growth rates for cn-waves (Fig. 2(d)) are analogous to that for dn-waves (Fig. 1(d)), 

but  the  important  result,  shown  in  Figs  2(e)-(g),  is  that  the  areas  of  existence  of 

perturbations  with  growth  rates  having  nonzero  real  part  vanish  when  the 

propagation  constant  exceeds  a  certain  critical  value 

crb .  Therefore,  above  the 
corresponding  energy  threshold,  the  families  of  multicolor  cn-waves  become 

completely  free  of  linear  instabilities  with  exponential  growth.  Figures  2(e)  and  2(f) 

indicate  that  the  threshold  energy  for  stabilization  decreases  when  the  phase 

mismatch  β   goes  from  −∞   to  approximately  0.25.  Thus,  stable  cn-waves  occur 

almost  in  the  whole  range  of  its  existence  at  small  positive  and  negative  β .  For 

example, at 

β = −  we have found stable cnoidal waves for  1

at

. The exponential instabilities 

of low-energy cn-waves associated to purely real growth rates exist at

β

1

In  the  region  0.25

(cid:49)

β < ∞

  we  have  found  oscillatory  instabilities  associated  to 

complex  growth  rates.  Such  instabilities  also  cease  to  exist  when  the  energy  flow 

exceeds  a  threshold  value.  Fig.  2(g)  illustrates  this  point  for 

β = .  For  oscillatory 

3

instabilities  the  critical  value  of  the  propagation  constant  also  decreases  as  β   goes 

from  ∞   to  approximately  0.25.  At  fixed  β   and  energy  flow,  the  complex  growth 

rates form the curves in the complex plane [Re( ), Im( )]

δ  shown in Fig. 2(h). The key 

δ

result of this paper is thus summarized in Fig. 2(i), which shows the threshold value 

of  the  propagation  constant  for  complete  stabilization  versus  phase  mismatch.  The 

left  curve  stands  for  exponential  instabilities  while  the  right  curve  stands  for 

oscillatory instabilities. 

To confirm the predictions of the linear stability analysis, we performed series 

of 

numerical 

simulations

pattern.  The  width  of  the  envelope  was  much  larger  than  the  cnoidal  wave  period. 

Figs 3(a)-(d) illustrate the outcome of the numerical simulations. The typical decay 

of low-energy cn-waves is shown in Fig. 3(a). Beyond the point of spontaneous onset 

of  the  instability,  the  wave  is  rapidly  destroyed.  In  clear  contrast,  Figs  3(b)-(d) 

illustrate  the  stable  propagation  of  perturbed  cnoidal  waves  for  several  values  of 

phase mismatch and energy flow. The cnoidal waves kept their input structure for all 

the monitored propagation distances, in some cases over several thousand units.

Therefore, in conclusion, the stability analysis of periodic cnoidal wave arrays 

in  quadratic  medium  performed  by  a  newly  developed  mathematical  formalism  has 

revealed the existence of completely stable patterns in the form of cn-waves. From an 

applied  point  of  view,  such  patterns  of  periodic  pixel-like  structures  can  find 

applications,  e.g.,  in  the  study  of  complex  light  patterns  generated  by  modulational 

instabilities,  or  in  the  implementation  of  digital  image  processing  schemes  based  on 

soliton-like  arrays  [19].  From  a  fundamental  viewpoint,  we  stress  that  the  reported 

multicolor cn-waves are the first known example in physics of stable periodic waves 

propagating in a conservative uniform medium supporting bright solitons.

We present results of high-resolution experiments on single ionization of He, Ne and Ar by 

ultra-short (25 fs, 6 fs) 795 nm laser pulses at intensities 0.15 – 2.0.1015 W/cm2. We show that 

the ATI-like pattern can survive deep  in the  tunneling  regime  and that  the atomic structure 

plays an important role in the formation of the low-energy photoelectron spectra even at high 

intensities.  The  absence  of  ponderomotive  shifts,  the  splitting  of  the  peaks  and  their 

degeneration  for  few-cycle  pulses  indicate  that  the  observed  structures  originate  from  a 

resonant process.

Single electron emission from atoms exposed to intense short-pulse laser fields is one 

of the most fundamental and well-studied reaction channels in non-linear strong-field physics 

[1]. One of the basic questions, however, which still disturbs a comprehensive understanding 

of the ionization dynamics, concerns the intensity regime that might be characterised by the 

transition  from  a  “photon”  to  a  “field”  based  view  of  the  problem.  Usually,  ionization  is 

considered  as either  a “multiphoton” or “tunnelling” process  depending  on the value of  the 

so-called  Keldysh  parameter

  (where 

pI   is  the  ionization  potential  and 

U p =

 the ponderomotive potential. I is the light intensity and ω its frequency; atomic 

units are used throughout). For 

1>γ  numerous experiments revealed the multiphoton nature 

of ionization reflected in a rich structure in the photoelectron spectra. Various field induced 

processes,  such  as 

resonant  and  non-resonant  above-threshold 

ionization 

(ATI), 

ponderomotive effects, channel-opening  and  closing  etc. were studied, and good agreement 

between theory and experiment has been achieved [2-7].  

For  the  other  extreme  case  of  very  low  γonly  few  experimental  results  have  been 

reported.  Early  experiments  performed  with  low-frequency  radiation  [8]  showed  a  good 

agreement  with  a  quasistatic  tunnelling  model  [9],  which  assumes  that  the  electron  first 

tunnels  into  the  continuum  and  then  moves  classically  driven  by  the  oscillating  laser  field. 

Later,  experiments  at  optical  frequencies  observed  a  significant  fraction  of  electrons  with 

energies higher than the maximal drift energy of 2 Up that an electron can gain in the field, 

forming a plateau-like structure in the high-energy part of the electron spectra [10,11]. Since 

then,  efforts  strongly  concentrated  to  explore  this  feature,  which  has  been  explained  within 

the tunnelling picture by considering the return of the electron to the ion core and subsequent 

elastic rescattering [11].  

Recently,  high-resolution  experiments  [12,13]  provided  evidences  for  the  resonant 

origin  of  detailed  narrow  structures  within  the  plateau,  in  agreement  with  a  series  of 

numerical simulations [14,15]. A comprehensive  analysis of the problem  performed in [15] 

revealed a close relation between resonant-like behaviour within the plateau and the existence 

of  electron  trajectories  which  lead  to  multiple  recollisions  with  the  parent  ion  [16].  The 

significance  of  multiphoton  resonances  for  “super-ponderomotive”  photoelectrons  in  the 

tunnelling  regime  was  predicted  in  [17]  for  the  case  of  He,  but  was  never  confirmed 

experimentally.  

The lowest value of the Keldysh parameter for which some regular ATI structure was 

ever observed is, to the best of our knowledge, γ~ 0.7 [6]. Experiments performed at lower 

γ either revealed a smooth decrease of the photoelectron spectra, with changes of the slope 

in the plateau region [8,11], or observed in addition some hardly resolved structure below 20 

eV [6,18]. Very recently precise measurements of ultra-low energy electron emission found a 

clear double-peak structure around zero [19] in the electron momentum distribution parallel 

to the laser polarization for Ne at the intensity 1.1015 W/cm2 (γ= 0.42). This minimum was 

predicted by recent semiclassical calculations [20] and was related to the Coulomb interaction 

of the emitted electron with the parent ion.  

In  this  Letter  we  report  on  the  first  experimental  observation  of  well  resolved 

pronounced and regular pattern in the electron emission characteristics for single ionization 

of He, Ne and Ar  at intensities of up to 1.5.1015  W/cm2 (γ < 0.5). We show that for 25  fs 

laser  pulses  the  low-energy  part  of  the  photoelectron  spectra  consists  of  a  series  of  wide 

peaks  separated  by  the  photon  energy,  which  exhibit  features  (absence  of  ponderomotive 

shifts, narrow substructures resolved within different peaks) typical for resonantly-enhanced 

ionization. These features are considerably washed out for 6-7 fs pulses. For ultra-low energy 

electrons  we  observe  clear  signatures  of  the  atomic  structure,  while  for  higher  energies  the 

spectra are similar for different atomic species.  

 The experiments were performed using a newly designed “reaction microscope” [21] 

with  further  improved  momentum  resolution  along  the  laser  polarization  direction  (∆P||  < 

0.02 a.u.). We used linearly polarized radiation of a Kerr-lens mode locked Ti:sapphire laser 

at 795 nm wavelength amplified to pulse energies of up to 350 µJ at 3 kHz. The width of the 

amplified pulses was 25 fs. To generate few-cycle pulses they are spectrally broadened in a 

gas-filled  hollow  fiber  and  then  compressed  to  6-7  fs  by  chirped  mirrors  and  a  prism 

compressor.  The  laser  beam  was  focused  to  a  spot  size  of  ~  7  µm  on  the  collimated 

supersonic gas jet in the ultra-high vacuum chamber (2.10−11 mbar). Fluctuations of the laser 

intensity from pulse to pulse were monitored during the experiment and did not exceed 5%. 

Absolute calibration of the peak intensity was performed using a clear kink in the measured 

photoelectron momentum distribution, which corresponds to the maximum drift momentum 

of 

pU2

that electrons can gain from the laser field (inset of Fig.1, for details see [22]).  

Ions  and  electrons  were  guided  to  two  position-sensitive  channel  plate  detectors  by 

weak  electric  (1V/cm)  and  magnetic  (5G)  fields  applied  along  the  laser  polarization  axis. 

From  the  time  of  flight  and  position  the  full  momentum  vectors  of  coincident  ions  and 

electrons  were  calculated.  Neglecting  the  small  momentum  of  the  absorbed  photons, 

momentum  conservation  was  ensured  for  each  single  event.  This  allows  one  to  exclude 

possible  influences  of  space-charge  effects  or  ponderomotive  acceleration  in  the  spatially 

inhomogeneous laser field since both would act differently on electrons and ions, and ensures 

that absolutely no contributions from higher charge states or impurities enter the spectra.  

Fig.  1  displays  momentum  distributions  of  singly  charged  ions  along  the  laser 

polarization  axis  for  He,  Ne  and  Ar  at  different  intensities  (γvaries  from  1.1  to  0.29)  for 

pulse lengths of 25 fs (Fig. 1a-c) and 6 fs (Fig. 1d), respectively. The data are integrated over 

the  transverse  momenta.  For  all  three  targets  the  spectra  at  the  lowest  intensity  manifest  a 

clear  set  of  peaks  that  are  broadened  as  the  intensity  grows,  emerging  for  the  highest 

intensities  into  a  shoulder-like  structure  at  the  positions  of  the  first  two  peaks.  Several 

surprising features can be observed. First, at least remnants of the lowest order peaks can be 

clearly followed up to the highest intensities, deep in the tunneling regime. Second, all peak 

positions are independent of the intensity. Third, clear remnants of the peaks can be observed 

even for the 6 fs pulses, although they are considerably smoothed. 

Apart from the overall similarity of the observed pattern for all the targets there is one 

striking difference, the appearance of a pronounced minimum at zero longitudinal momentum 

for He and Ne, whereas there is a clear maximum for Ar. Within semiclassical calculations 

[20], the dip at zero momentum was attributed to the interaction of electrons with their parent 

ion  through  many  recollisions  at  very  low  energy.  Accordingly,  the  shape  of  the  scattering 

potential should influence the emission of ultra-low energy electrons and therefore they might 

be the only ones that remain sensitive to the target structure at very high intensities. 

In order to clarify the origin of the observed structures, we next examine the electron 

energy spectra. As it is shown in Fig. 2 for the case of Ne, electron energy distributions also 

exhibit  a  series  of  peaks,  which  are  separated  by  the  photon  energy  and  broadened  with 

increasing intensity. Thus, we do observe the evolution of the ATI-like structure and again, as 

in  the  momentum  representation,  the  peaks  do  not  exhibit  intensity-dependent  shifts  (see 

vertical  dashed  lines  in  Fig.  1-2).  Zooming  into  the  details  by  fully  exploiting  the  high 

resolution  of  our  electron  imaging  system  along  the  longitudinal  direction  and  plotting  the 

longitudinal part of the electron kinetic energy only, we find a pronounced fine structure with 

at least two sub-peaks repeated within different ATI orders at different intensities (Fig. 2b).  

The  splitting  of  the  ATI-like  peaks  together  with  the  absence  of  any  detectable 

pondermotive shifts might lead to assume them to be of resonant nature. Non-resonant ATI 

peaks  are  known  to  shift  towards  lower  energies  as  the  intensity  grows  due  to  the  field–

induced  increase  of  the  ionization  potential,  which  is  approximately  equal  to  the 

ponderomotive energy Up. For λ = 795 nm at a laser peak intensity of 1.0 PW/cm2 Up is as 

high as 60 eV. Thus, averaging over different intensities (spatio-temporal pulse distribution 

and intensity fluctuations) on a level of less than 3% will result in variations of Up exceeding 

the photon energy, so that any non-resonant ATI peaks will definitely be smeared out.  

The situation is different for the case of resonantly-enhanced ionization, which occurs 

through an excited atomic level shifted into multiphoton resonance with the ground state. In 

early  studies  two  scenarios  resulting  in  the  intensity-independent  ATI  peak  positions  were 

suggested.  First  one  [4]  assumes  that  ionization  from  an  excited  state  occurs  before  the 

intensity  has  considerably  changed,  so  that  it  always  proceeds  at  the  intensity  required  to 

fulfil  the  resonance  condition  and  accordingly,  at  some  certain  value  of  the  ponderomotive 

shift. If the peak intensity is higher than the resonant value, the resonance condition can be 

fulfilled somewhere in the laser focus. The second scenario [5] suggests that the excited state 

survives longer in the laser pulse and is ionized later by one- or multi-photon absorption. If 

the  excited  state  is  a  high-lying  Rydberg  state,  it  is  shifted  upwards  almost  as  much  as  the 

continuum level, again giving rise to intensity-independent peak positions.  

Of  course,  such  considerations  can  hardly  be  directly  applied  at  high  intensities, 

where  any  intermediate  state  must  be  completely  deformed  by  the  laser  field.  However, 

numerical  simulations  [14,15,17]  have  shown  that  some  excited  states  may  remain 

surprisingly stable or even be induced by the laser field (light induced states). The part of the 

wave function that tunnels out of the atom might effectively populate these extended quasi-

bound states producing resonant-like structures in the photoelectron spectra [13,17]. 

Contributions from any resonant-like mechanisms should be sensitive to the length of 

the laser pulse. For pulse durations of less than  10 fs all Rydberg states have Kepler orbits 

considerably  longer,  which  can  result  in  a  suppression  of  resonantly-enhanced  ionization 

[23]. Besides that, if the lifetime of the excited state is comparable to the pulse length, their 

mutual interrelation starts to play a role.  In our data, comparing results obtained with 23 fs 

and 6-7  fs pulses  for  Ne (Figures 1b  and 1d), one can see that  with shorter pulses the ATI 

peaks are smoothed out, and are only distinguishable for the lowest intensity.  

Even  more  information  about  the  ionization  dynamics  can  be  obtained  by 

consideration of the angular-resolved data. Figure 3 presents density plots of 2-dimensional 

electron  momentum  distributions  for  different  atomic  species  and  pulse  lengths.  In  this 

representation ATI peaks manifest themselves  as ring-like structures.  In striking contrast to 

the  common  belief,  the  electron  emission  characteristics  show  a  surprisingly  rich  structure, 

even in the tunneling regime. The spectra clearly contain target-specific features in the low-

energy  region;  however,  for  higher  longitudinal  momenta  the  spectra  for  different  targets 

exhibit similar pattern with pronounced maxima and minima in the angular distribution. All 

these features are noticeably washed out for short 6-7 fs pulses (compare Fig. 3c and 3d).  

As  of  now,  the  origin  of  the  structures  observed  in  the  two-dimensional  momentum 

distributions in terms of simple pictures remains completely unclear. The angular distribution 

of  any  resonant–enhanced  contribution  should  reflect  the  symmetry  of  the  state  through 

which  ionization  has  occurred  [7].  This  can  result  in  an  atomic  species  dependence  of  the 

data, in particular, in different behaviour in the ultra-low energy region, as observed in Fig.3. 

Taking into account low peak-to-valley contrast of the spectra, we assume that the resonantly 

enhanced part is embedded into a strong nonresonant contribution, and thus, superposition of 

both should define the angular distribution of the emitted electrons.  

In order to perform a detailed comparison between theory and experiment one should 

not only properly describe the atomic structure modified by the laser field, but also account 

for contributions from resonant and nonresonant intensities realized in different parts of the 

spatio-temporal distribution of the pulse. This way single ionization of Ar at intensities up to 

1014  W/cm2  was  perfectly  described  within  a  single  active  electron  model  by  solving 

numerically the time-dependent Schrödinger equation [7]. The extension of this approach to 

higher intensities will, of course, require larger  computational efforts. However, our  results 

show  that  truly  quantum  dynamical  effects  definitely  play  an  important  role  even  at  high 

intensities,  where  the  electron  motion  after  the  tunnelling  is  often  viewed  to  proceed 

classically.  If  one  considers  tunnelling  ionization  as  a  periodic  ejection  of  electron  wave 

packets at the maxima of the oscillating laser field [24], quantum interferences between the 

coherent  wave  packets  will  lead  to  the  well  known  ATI  structure  in  the  electron  spectrum. 

For shorter pulses, only a few maxima contribute making the peak structure less pronounced.   

In conclusion, we have studied the evolution of ATI-like structures in electron spectra 

over a broad range of Keldysh parameters (1.1 > γ > 0.29). We have shown that low-order 

ATI  peaks  with  some  target-dependent  substructure  can  be  resolved  deep  in  the  tunnelling 

regime. The peaks do not exhibit ponderomotive shifts and are less pronounced for ionization 

by few-cycle laser pulses. These are typical features for resonant-enhanced ionization, well-

known for the case of much lower intensities. The importance of resonant enhancement and 

its  connection  to  recollision  phenomena  was  recently  demonstrated  for  the  plateau  in  the 

photoelectron  spectra  [12-17].  Taking  into  account  latest  results  showing  that  recollision 

effects  also  manifest  themselves  at  low  electron  energies  [19,20],  we  conclude  that  the 

structures presented in our data originate from a similar type of resonant process. However, a 

detailed description of the intermediate states involved, their relation to the field-free atomic 

levels and influence on the electron energy and angular distributions remains the subject of 

forthcoming analyses.

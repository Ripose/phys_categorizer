Abstract 
 
A  mechanism  that  explains the increase of  electromagnetic  (EM)  perturbations during 

earthquakes  is  proposed.  When  earthquakes  occur,  surface  waves  propagate  along  the 

globe  surface  inducing  a  globe  surface  rippling,  which  is  reproduced  in  an  amplified 

manner  at  the  atmosphere- ionosphere  interface.  A  surface  EM  wave  that  imparts  a 

quiver  velocity  to  electrons  propagates  along  the  rippled  interface  encountering  a 

periodic plasma density. A non-linear density current is consequently generated that is a 

source of EM waves. The wave equation is solved and the EM field is determined. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

When a stored energy of a chemical, gravitational or simply an elastic form is released 

suddenly in the earth, an earthquake occurs. It is manifested at our level by the shaking 

of  the  soil.    The  shaking  is  a  response  to  elastic  waves  that  travel  through  the  rocks. 

However, for the facture of the rocks to occur, the accumulated stress ought to exceed 

the  strength  of  these  rocks.  Earthquakes  may  be  induced  as  well,  by  some  human 

activities,  such  as,  detonation  of  large  underground  explosions,  and  filling  of  large 

reservoirs.  Around  the  fracture,  seismic  waves  are  generated  and  radiated  in  all 

directions.  These  waves  may  be  classified  into  volume  and  surface  waves.  The  volume 

waves  that  propagate  within  the  earth  contain  the  primary  wave s  (p),  which  are 

longitudinal  and  capable  to propagate in solids as well as in  liquids, and the secondary 

waves (s), which are transverse and are transmitted only in solids by way of shearing of 
rocks1-3. On the other hand, the surface waves that are confined to propagate along the 

earth surface, consist of  Love and  Rayleigh  waves.  Both  the  waves  induce  horizontal 

motion,  nonetheless  only  Ra yleigh  waves  are  a  source  of  vertical  soil  movement.  In 

fact, at distances greater that 100 km form the source, the ma in damage is primarily due 

to  surface  waves.  During  the  deformation, rocks  exhibit  an  increase  in  volume,  which 

affects consequently the seismic velocities, electric resistivity, as well as soil and water 

levels.  Furthermore,  the  coupling  between  the  ground  in  motion  and  the  atmosphere 

leads  to  an  increase  of  wave  processes  activity.  For  instance,  hours  before  an 
earthquake,  a  green  light  attributed  to  atomic  oxygen  is  radiated1,4.  It  is  confirmed 

experimentally  also,  that  in  connection  with  earthquakes,  electromagnetic  waves  are 
generated  in  the  ionosphere5. Besides, by way of ionosondes and GPS receivers, it has 

been  measured  an  increase  of  the  variability  of  electron  concentration  in  the 
ionosphere6.The  mechanism  at  the  root  of  the  transformation  of  acous tic  waves 

generated  at  the  globe  surface,  in  EM  waves  in  the  ionosphere  has  not  been 

satisfactorily  elucidated.  To  this  end,  a  satellite  called  Demeter  (Detection  of  EM 

Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions) has been recently launched by CNES 
(the French Centre National des études Spatiales)7. Nonetheless, there was an attempt to 

shine  some  light  on  this  issue  in  Ref.[8],  where  a  collisional  model  is  suggested.  We 

believe   however,  that  this  model  does  not  reproduce  an  actual  picture  of  the  wave 

transformation  mechanism,  since  it  overlooks  the  effect  of  the  atmosphere-ionosphere 

interface physics. We propose in this note a model that takes into account the coupling 

between the soil movement and the atmosphere, as well as the physics of the interface.  

 

 

 

Prior to any analysis, let’s expose the main idea of our theory related to the generation 

of  EM  waves  as  a  response  to  earthquakes.  Any  rippling  of  the  soil  due  to  the 

propagation  of  a  seismic  surface  wave  such  as  a  Ra yleigh  wave  is  transmitted  to  the 

ionosphere  by  way  of  an  acoustic  wave  that  propagates  in  the  atmosphere.  As  a 

consequence,  the  interface  between  the  neutral  atmosphere  and  the  ionized  ionosphere 

gets rippled. It may be recalled, that periodical structures are induced by powerful laser 

irradiation on metallic surfaces that enhance the energy transfer through coupling with 
surface electromagnetic waves9-11. Consequently we  dwell an analogy with the problem 

of  laser/metal  interaction  cited  above,  and  model  the  rippled  atmosphere/iono sphere 

interface by a periodic electron density (c.f. Ref.[12]). The equation of the interface may 

be written as follows,

In  our  case,  the  surface  wave  does  not  propagate  along  the  zˆ  axis in  a  homogeneous  

plasma,  but  rather  in  an  inhomogeneous  plasma  with  a  periodic  density.  During  its 

propagation,  the  surface  wave  encounters  matter  on  a  segment  of 

    length,  and

vacuum  on  the  subsequent  one,  in  an  alternating  manner.  Hence,  the  plasma  density 

may be modeled by the following function,

and  thought  to  be  a  tool  for  earthquakes  prediction.  We  present  in  this  note  a  new 

mechanism to  explain  the  EM  waves’ generation during the earthquakes.  As such, the 

phenomenon is not relevant for prediction, but we believe it could be a diagnostic tool. 

We  state  tha t  when  an  earthquake  occurs,  surface  waves  propagate  along  the  globe 

surface, and the variation of the soil level induces an acoustic wave that propagates in 

the atmosphere up  to the ionosphere. Hence, the ripple of the soil is reproduced at the 

level  of  the  atmosphere/  ionosphere  interface.  After  having  developed  the  model,  we 

fortunately, found an earlier work that gives justifications to our hypothesis. Indeed, it  is 

stated  in  Ref.[15]  that  Rayleigh  waves  induce  atmospheric  pressure  disturbances  by 
vertical  pulsed  action.  The  waves  may  even  propagate  up  to  heights  of  ~

110 Km 

without  noticeable  damping  for  the  low  frequency  components.  Moreover,  the 

amplitude  increases  with  increasing  altitude.  The  soil  ripple  amplitude  is magnified  at 

the atmosphere-ionosphere  interface. Furthermore,  it is established that at the interface 

of vacuum/plasma, a surface wave propagates. Now that the ripple is formed, we show 

that  the  SEW  (surface  EM  wave)  encounters  a  periodic  plasma  density.  The  SEW 

imparts to electrons. As a consequence a non- linear current density vector is generated, 

which is a source of EM waves.

Operating the SLAC/KEK DDS (Damped Detuned Structure) X-band linacs at high gradients (in excess of 70MV/m) 
has recently been found to be limited by the accelerator structures breaking down and as a consequence severe damage 
occurs to the cells which makes the structures inoperable.  A series of recent experiments at SLAC indicates that arcing 
in the structures is significantly reduced if the group velocity of the accelerating mode is reduced and additionally it has 
been discovered that reducing the length of the accelerating structure also limits the number and intensity of breakdown 
events  [1].    However,  in  designing  new  accelerating  structures  care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  beam-induced 
transverse wakefields do not cause the beam to become unstable.  Here, we report on damping transverse wakefields in 
two different short structures: a 90cm traveling  wave structure in which the wakefield is coupled out to four attached 
manifolds  and  secondly,  in  a  standing  wave  structure  in  which  a  limited  number  of  cells  heavily  damp  down  the 
wakefield

Abstract 
Operating 
(Damped  Detuned 
Structure)  X-band  linacs  at  high  gradients  (in  excess  of 
70MV/m)  has  recently  been  found  to  be  limited  by  the 
accelerator structures breaking down and as a consequence 
severe  damage  occurs  to  the  cells  which  makes  the 
structures  inoperable.    A  series  of  recent  experiments  at 
SLAC indicates that arcing in the structures is significantly 
reduced  if  the  group  velocity  of  the  accelerating  mode  is 
reduced  and  additionally  it  has  been  discovered  that 
reducing the length of the accelerating structure also limits 
the  number  and 
intensity  of  breakdown  events  [1].  
However,  in  designing  new  accelerating  structures  care 
must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  beam-induced  transverse 
wakefields  do  not  cause  the  beam  to  become  unstable.  
Here,  we  report  on  damping  transverse  wakefields  in  two 
different  short  structures:  a  90cm  traveling  wave  structure 
in  which  the  wakefield  is  coupled  out  to  four  attached 
manifolds  and  secondly,  in  a  standing  wave  structure  in 
which  a  limited  number  of  cells  heavily  damp  down  the 
wakefield

   The transverse wakefield is proportional to the transverse 
force on the beam integrated along the principal axis of the 
accelerator.    The  long-range  transverse  wakefield  is  an 
important  parameter  in  the  design  of  linear  colliders 
because 
transverse 
deflections of the beam which can lead to a dilution in the 
beam  luminosity  and  to  a  BBU  (Beam  Break  Up) 
instability.  Over half a decade ago the transverse wakefield 
of  the  first  1.8  meter  structure,  of  what  would  become  a 
series,  of  damped  and  detuned  structures  (DDS)  was 
measured at SLAC[2].  The wakefield was found to be well 
predicted  by  the  circuit  model  and  the  built-in  structure 
diagnostics  were  confirmed 
(namely,  beam  position 
monitoring  and  structure  alignment  through  monitoring  a 
small portion of the dipole signal radiated to the manifold).   
However,  recently  it  has  been  found  that  these  structures 
suffer  from  RF  breakdown  and  this  results  in  severe  cell 
damage.    In  order  to  alleviate  this  problem  shorter  (90cm 
and 60cm) structures with a fundamental phase advance of 
5π/6  (rather  than  2π/3  as  in  the  past  RDDS  series)  have 
been designed at SLAC and KEK and these structures have 
been  analysed  with  local  damping  in  mind  for  future 
structures.    It  is  the  purpose  of  section  2  of  this  paper  to

investigate as to whether or not a manifold damped version 
of these LDS (locally damped structures) is able to dampthe 
transverse wakefield adequately for this shorter structure at 
an accelerating phase advance of 5π/6. 
   Also under consideration are standing wave structures of 
lengths 20cm and 30cm.  These structures require a reduced 
incident  energy  to  obtain  accelerating  gradients  equivalent 
to  the  proposed  high  phase  advance  travelling  wave 
structures  and  they  have  the  added  benefit  that  once  a 
breakdown occurs at an iris then the field collapses and the 
power  is  immediately  reflected  with  little  power  being 
dissipated  directly  in  the  structure  itself  [3].    In  the  third 
section a method for damping the transverse wakefield in a 
group  of  standing  wave  structures  which  taken  together, 
allows a Gaussian fall off in the wake function.  Additional 
damping  is  provided  by  heavily  loading  down  a  limited 
number  of  cells.      The  final  calculation  of  the  wakefield 
indicates that loading down 7 cells with a Q of 10 out of a 
total  of  138  cells  provides  excellent  damping  of  the  lower 
dipole band. 

2.  MANIFOLD  DAMPED  WAKES  IN 
TRAVELING-WAVE STRUCTURES 

   In  order  to  calculate  the  beam-induced  wakefield  in  a 
multi-cell  structure  we  utilize  a  circuit  model  to  calculate 
the  dispersion  curves  of  the  structure.    The  circuit  model 
described  in  [4]  is  modified  to  take  into  account  variable 
cell  loading  through  resistors  placed  in  series  with  each 
capacitor.  We focus on the structure under design  at SLAC

 namely,  H90VG5,  a  structure  consisting  of  83  cells  in 
which the initial group velocity of the accelerating mode is 
0.0506%  of  the  velocity  of  light  and  the  phase  advance  at 
the  accelerating  frequency  (11.424  GHz.)  is  chosen  to  be

  This  structure  has  been  designed  with  a  2-
dimensional computer code Omega2D [5] without attaching 
manifolds.    In  order  to  model  the  effect  of  adding  four 
manifolds the dipole dispersion curves are supplemented by 
the  manifold  dispersion  curve    (prior  to  coupling  to  the 
structure).    The  parameters  for  the  manifold  are  chosen  to 
be similar to those  used in the design RDDS1 [6] in order

process  we  chose  three  representative  cells  (1,42  and  83) 
and from these cells we obtain all remaining parameters by 
fitting  quadratic  functions  to  the  known  parameters  as  
function  of  the  synchronous  frequency.      The  Brillioun

intensity of the coupling of the dipole mode to the manifold 
mode is directly proportional to the minimum separation of 
the lower two dispersion curves. 
   The  wake  function  is  calculated  by  utilizing  the  spectral 
function  method  [7]  and  this  technique  is  applied  to  the 
LDS (locally damped structure) and to the same structure in 
which a manifold is coupled through coupling slots at each 
cell.  The spectral functions that result from this calculation 
are shown in Fig.  3 and  it is evident that the DDS  shows 
superior damping properties compared to the LDS 
  The inverse transform of the spectral function enables the 
wake function to be calculated and this is shown in Fig. 4.  
The wake field is well damped in the DDS compared to the 
LDS where BBU will occur unless the structure frequencies   
are interleaved [8].

3.  DAMPING  WAKEFIELDS  IN  STANDING 
WAVE ACCELERATOR STRUCTURES 
   To  demonstrate  the  damping  of  dipole  wakefields  in 
standing  wave  structures  we  consider  an  amalgamated 
structure  consisting  of  6  individual  accelerating  structures 
each  of  which  has  23  cells  (making  a  total  of  138  cells).

The mode density of the “super-structure” is made to follow 
a  Gaussian  functional  form  by  enforcing  an  error  function 
variation on  the tapering down of the iris dimensions  with 
increasing cell number.   This makes the wakefield initially 
fall off rapidly with a Gaussian distribution but as there are 
of course a  finite  number of  cells then the  wake recoheres 
and  thus  additional  damping  is  required.    We  consider 
direct local damping to accomplish the task of maintaining

remaining points fit the curves generated.  The synchronous 
point  (shown  in  Fig.  5  and  Fig.  6)  is  considerably  shifted 
away  from  the  π  point  compared  to  the  traveling  wave 
structure and thus the lower band TE modal content will be 
significantly  enhanced.    The  lower  band  kick  factors  (K, 
shown  in  Fig.  6)  do  not  have  a  linear  variation  with 
synchronous frequency as they did in all previous traveling 
structures  designed  at  SLAC  even  though  the  TM  content 
increases  as  the  irises  pinch  down  with  increasing  cell 
number.   However, the TE content also increases markedly 
and  this  leads  to  a  decrease  in  the  kick  factors  of  the  first 
band towards the end of the amalgamated structure.  This of 
course  has  a  beneficial  effect  on  the  wakefield  as  the 
spectral  function  (shown  in  Fig.  7)  has  an  almost  equal 
spacing of modes in the upper and lower

the fall off in the wakefield    The local damping is limited 
to the first cell of each individual structure so that there are 
in total only 7 cells which we load down heavily  with a Q 
of  10  for  both  the  TE  and  TM  modes.    We  envisage  the 
cells in which the dipole mode are damped to be cut-off to 
the accelerating mode and thus to have little impact on the 
shunt  impedance  of  that  mode.    The  practicality  of 
simultaneously  loading  down  both  TE  and  TM  modes  is 
currently under investigation. 
   Three  cells  are  chosen 
to  parameterize  the  dipole 
characteristics of the structure and the dispersion curve for 
cell  69  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.    The  zero  and  π  modes  are

the  high 
structures  previously  considered 
frequency  modes  were  widely  spaced  relative  to  the  lower 
band  modes).    The  wake  function  (shown  in  Fig.  8), 
obtained  as  a  Fourier  transform  of  the  spectral  function 
benefits  from  this  new  modal  distribution  in  that  the 
damping  of  the  wakefield  is  well  sustained.      The  wake 
initially damps with a Gaussian roll-off due to the detuning 
of the cells and at later distances the loaded Q of the modes 
starts to play a role.  In the region 0.42cm to 400cm the Q is 
approximately 300.     
   However,  higher  order  dipole  bands  must  also  be 
analyzed.  Preliminary calculations on the second band, for 
example,  indicate  that  the  kick  factors  have  a  similar 
magnitude  as  the  lower  dipole  band  and  these  will  also 
require damping.

 In this paper we reveal an additional new cause for decreasing of particles
 interference. We found that particle which, transmits kinetic energy to the detector
 decrease its wave packet area size. A detector that transmits kinetic energy to the
 particle increases the particle wave packet area. We found these phenomena cause
 decrease in the interference pattern .We show that the interference pattern decrease is
 graduate and proportional to the amount of the particle kinetic energy change. We
 show that our findings are in agreement with the results of different experiments like
 the two slits experiment and the two paths interferometer experiment. We conclude
 the wave like behavior of the particle, is not have to lost in the detection process, it
 changes its area size.

Recent  development  in  the  experimental  technology  enables  to  study
quantum  mechanics  at  the  level  of  a  single  particle.For  instance,
experimental  realization  of  the  two  slits  experiment  [1,2]  .In  this
experiment a single particle can propagate through two slits and exhibits
a self interference characteristic. The particle interference patterns is
loss when a particle location detector is activated.
Additional  experiment  is  the  two  path  interferometer  experiment  of
Heiblum  et  al    [3].In this experiment  an  electron  can  propagate  through
two separate channels made of quantum wires,with joint beginning and
ending. Electron interference effect is obtained at the joint ending of the
two channels. Once a detector, which is located in proximity to one of the
channels, is activated a reduction of the interference visibility is obtained.
The experiment is explained by dephasing of the electron [3-6] .

Analyzing  the  two  slits  and  two  paths  experiments  we  revealed  a  new
additional cause for the loss of particle interference pattern. In this paper
we show that the particle wave function size changes, due to energy
exchange with a detector. Causing decreasing in the interference pattern.

We describes the particle wavefuncion as a wave packet [7,8].Looking at
the  detection  operation  in  the  two  slits  experiment,  we  show  that  a
particle  observed  by  a  detector  that  absorbs  kinetic  energy  from  the
particle,  result  in  decrease  of  the  particle  wave  function  size    .  This
detector  can  be  for  example,  a  photo  electric  detector  or  some  types  of
electronic  detectors.  We  show  that  an  increase  in    the  particle  kinetic
energy  which  can  be  caused  by  a  second  type  of  detector  increase  the
wave packet size.

There are various kinds of wave packets that are appropriate solution of
the Schrodinger equation.These wave packet differ by the weight function
A(k)  .  Equation.1  is  a  general  equation  for  a  one  dimensional  wave
packet,

choose this function because it has small dispersion .

We  now obtain a three dimensional solution to the problem of reduction
of the particle wave packet size distribution in space due to loss of kinetic
energy.

Equation 4 is a solution of  the Schrodinger function for free particle in
spherical coordinates.
Inserting  the  free  wave  function  into  a  potential  step  cause  loss  of  the
wave  function  kinetic  energy  at  an  amount  of  the  potential  energy  step.
On condition the free wave function`s initial kinetic energy is higher than
the step potential.We choose  the constant radial potential U =U0
for r > 0, this potential can be for example a coulomb potential between
an  electron  and  a  proton  the  attraction  potential  slows  the  electron
movement  and  the  electron  loss  kinetic  energy.Different  values  of  the
potential represent different values of kinetic energy, our aim is to show
correlation  between  the particle  (in  this  example  the  electron)amount  of
kinetic  energy  loss  and  decrease  in  the  particle  wavefuction  size    .The
constant radial potential can be for instance a coulomb potential act on a
distance  larger  than  the  electron  wave  packet  size,  in  this  case  the
coulomb potential can be approximated as constant in all the wave packet
area.The  constant potential  represents  the  net loss  of the particle  kinetic
energy.

We approximate the weight function A (k) as unchanged after the kinetic
energy  change.  Because  the  main  wavevector  region,  which  is  the
is  narrow
wavevectors  region  with  high  probability  coefficients 
comparing  to  the  all  wavevectors  region.  Additional  reason  is  although
A(k) is not changed after the energy change .Each A(k) coefficients relate
after  the  energy  change  to  a  different  wavevector  than  the  wavevector
before the change. Instead of the wave vector k ,after the kinetic energy
loss A(k) is the weight coefficient of the wavevector  (k^2-K0 ^2) ^0.5.
We  get  proportional  distribution  weight  coefficient  for  a  different
wavevectors  region.      The  weight  function  indicate  that  most  of
wavevectors  are  distributed  in  a  small  region  around  k0.,  the  probability
coefficient  of  the  wave  vectors  outside  this  region  is  negligible.  In  the
main wavevectors region the kinetic energy of the  wavevectors is larger
than  U0  and  the  transmission  coefficient  is  close  to  unity.We  then
t as 1 and the reflected part
approximated the transmission coefficient of

The  kinetic  energy  decrease  of  the  wave  function  is  expressed  by  a
change  in  the  wavevector  value  as  seen  in  eq.7  The  width  of  a  wave
packet  is  determined  by  interference  between  the  wavevectors  of  the
wave packet. Let the main range of the wavevectors in the wave  packet
be [k1,k2]  .  When the  particle    loss  kinetic  energy  as  in various  detection
processes the wave vectors are changing. Kinetic energy decrease of 
E
will change the wave vector k to (k^2-K0^2)^0.5 where K0 is defined in
eq.5.The main wavevectors range changes to
 [(k1^2-K0^2)^0.5,(k2^2-K0^2)^0.5 ] the main  region after the decrease in
the  particle  kinetic  energy  is  larger  than    [k1,k2]      a  broader  range  of
wavevectors  influencing  the  interference  in  the  wave  packet  result  in
decrease of the wave packet volume size.

We  now  look  at  the  dynamics  of  the  process.We  discuss  the  one
dimension case but it can extent to two and three dimensions. Let a free
electron  wave  packet  propagate  in  the  x    direction.The  electron  total
energy E is,E=<Ek > + <U> .Where Ek is the electron kinetic energy and
U is the electron potential energy. The electron wave packet encounter a
potential  step  of  value  U0  ,We  take  E  >U0  .  Transmission  through  the
potential step causes the particle to lose kinetic energy at the amount of
the potential value  U0  ,  U0  = 
Ek.  The  change  in the  energy  is  shown  in
figure.2,  figure.2a  shows  the  potential  of  a  free  propagating  electron
one-dimensional  wave  packet  then  reaching  a  potential  step  and
transmitted through it, we assume the reflected part is negligible. Fig .2b
is  the  graph  of  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  electron,  the  electron    has  a
constant  value  until  it  transmits  through  the  potential  step  then  the
electron`s  kinetic  energy  is  reduced  in  an  amount  equal  to  the  potential
energy  U0.    A  potential  step  constant  in  space  and  time  is  similar  to
irreversible  loss  of  kinetic  energy.  Then  the  Schrodinger  equation  in  a
potential step is appropriate for describing an irreversible kinetic energy
loss. At least for cases when the kinetic energy before transmitted through
the potential step is higher than the potential step.

To demonstrate the effect of a particle detection we look at the two slits
experiment[1,2],in the experiment a particle that propagates through
two microscopic slits, exhibits an interference pattern of a particle wave
function which pass through the two slits and interferes with itself. When

S

the  particle  interact  with  a  detector  which  detect  through  which  slit  the
particle  propagate  the  interference  pattern  decreases.Our  finding  is  that
kinetic  energy  is  transmitted  in  irreversible  way  from  the  particle  to  the
detector causing the particle wave function area to decrease.The decrease
in the particle wave function in the axis parallel to the line connecting  the
two slits cause the wave function to be narrow enough to pass through

only one slit.For this case we solve the two dimensional time dependent
Schrodinger`s equation ,

be interpreted as interaction of the electron with electronic detector where
at  a  certain  distance  the  coulomb  potential  can  be  approximated  as

st is the transmitted wave function area, reduced due to the electron loss

 
  of kinetic energy.

We  take  k0x  >  k0y    to  have  a  dominant  propagation  direction  of  the  free
electron  along  the  x  direction.  Transmitting  some  of  it`s  energy  to  the
detector we obtain that electron wave packet size st  is reduced.This  size
reduction  causes  the  electron  wave  function  to  become  too  narrow  to
propagate through  two slits and the electron is propagating through only
one slit as a result there is no interference pattern.

For explanation of the two slits experiment with a detector type that emits
energy signal and by the change in the emitting signal detect the electron
location.  We  look  at  the  two  paths  interferometer  experiment[2].In  this

experiment  an  electron  wave  function  propagate  through  two  separate
paths  ,the  paths  have  joint  beginning  and  ending.  The  interference  is
determined by the phase difference between in the wave function an the
ending of the two paths.When a detector is  operating on one  of  the  two
paths, the quantum point contact detector`s [10]  electron current interacts
with  the  electron  wave  function  in  this  path  .The  detector  transmits
kinetic energy to the measured electron through the coulomb interaction
between  the  electron  in  the  path  and  the  electron  current  in  the
detector.This can be obtained  from the experimental results that indicate
reduction in the detector voltage Vd when the measured electron interact
with the detector. Looking at eq .14 we see that decreasing the detector`s
electrons  effective  voltage  V  decrease  the  electrons  velocity  and  its
kinetic energy.

where m is the electron mass e is the electron charge, V is the effective
voltage  through  the  detector,  c  is  the  speed  of  light,
  =v/c  ,v  is  the
electron  velocity.Since  the  propagation  direction  of  the  detector`s
electron is the same as the propagation direction of  the  measured  single
electron in the path. A momentum transfer to the single electron increase
its  kinetic  energy.  Equation.14  is  an  approximated  equation  for  electron
current behavior in solid state.When increasing externally the voltage as
seen from eq.14 the electrons increase their velocity and  kinetic  energy.
Since the propagation direction of the detector`s electrons is the same as
the  propagation  direction  of  the  measured  single  electron  in  the  path.
Interacting with the single electrons the detector`s electrons transfer to the
single electron  more kinetic energy.

We  write  the  single  electron  wave  function  as  a  product  of  the  wave
function confined at the boundaries potential in the lateral y direction, and
a free wave packet moving along the propagation x direction.

We looked at the interference along the propagation in x direction.
The increase in the electron kinetic energy is considered as the solution of
Schroedinger  equation  with  approximated  potential  U=-Ux        for  x>a
where a is the coordinate at the end of the interaction region between the
electron  in  the  path  and  the  detector`s  electrons  current.  Since  the
electron`s interaction with the detector is only in the small region of the
point contact, after the single electron pass through this region we define
that  the  potential  Ux    equals  to  the  net  amount  of  the  observed  electron
kinetic gain along the propagation direction x.
 We consider the electron wave vector main region is around k0

After  the  electron  wave  packet  increase  due  to  receiving  kinetic  energy
from the detector`s electrons current there is still interference between the
two  paths  where  the  wave  function  in  the  path  with  no  detector  is
unchanged.The  interference  pattern  obtain  in  this  case  is  between  two
wave  packets  with  different  longitude  widths  which  consisted  of  two
different main regions of wavevectors

The  interference  equation  when  considering  only  the  main  wavevector

Where P is the probability density .The third term in eq.16 is a cosine of
the difference between the main wavevectors of the two wave functions,
cause reduction of the inference pattern visibility. Summing over all the
wavevectors range and not only on the main value and adding wavevector
changes  in  the  y  axis,will  reduce  the  interference  visibility  even
more.Small increasing in the kinetic energy of the single electron

would  increase less the wave packet size and the interference loss would
be smaller.This is obtained in the experiment result of Heiblum et al [2].
In the experiment the interference visibility reduced gradually, correlated
to  increase  of  the  voltage  through  the  detector.This  is  as  we  discussed
result  in  increasing  of  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  electrons  current  in  the
detector,which  increase  the  kinetic  energy  gained  by  the  electron  in  the
path.  Changes  in  kinetic  energy  of  the  particle  wave  packet  doesn`t
necessarily cause loss of coherence .In some cases there is a continuation
of  phase  during  the  energy  change  process,this  appears  for  example  in
D.E Pritchard et al, experience [12]. In this experiment a coherent beam
of  atomic  sodium`s  scattered  by  photons.  The  photons  changed  the  x
component  of  the  atoms  momentum  resulting  loss  of  the  interference
pattern  created  by  propagating  the  atomic  beam  through  diffraction
grating. When detecting only a narrow part of the scattered beam ,which
relate  to  a  certain  momentum  change  most  of  the  interference  pattern
regain.This  indicate  that  wavevectors  change  in  the  particle  wavepakect
due  to  kinetic  energy  gaining,  did  not  cause  loss  of  the  wave  packet
coherence.  Then  two  particles  that  were  coherent  before  the  kinetic
energy change are coherent after this energy change.
In a strongly disordered environment and noise it is not expected that the
particle remain coherent, in these cases an additional effect of dephasing
occur [6].

The  results  of  our  research  can  be  extended  to  Schroedinger  equation
with variable potential that represents a successive discrete or  continuos
transmission of energy between the single particle and the detector.
             In  conclusion  the  detection  process  causes  changes  in  the  wave
function size due to energy exchanges between the particle wave function
and the detector .In experiment where the particle transmit energy to the
detector, the particle wave function, described as a wave packet, reduced
it`s distribution uncertainty size. We described these changes in two and
three  dimensions  for  area  and  volume  reduction  respectively.This  size
reduction  cause  loss  of  inference  pattern.The  magnitude  of  the  size
change  is  correlated  to  the  amount  of  kinetic  energy  lost.When  the
particle  gains  kinetic  energy  from  a  detector  the  particle  wave  function
distribution  size  increases  .The  interference  loss  in  the  two  paths
interferometer  experiment  explained  in  addition  to  the  dephasing  effect,
as  an  interference  between  one  path  in  which  the  wave  function  is
unchanged and a second path that it`s wave function increased it`s wave
packet length due to kinetic energy gains from the detector.
         I like to thank G. Kventsel for valuable discussions.

We  address  Bessel  photonic  lattices  of  radial  symmetry  imprinted  in  cubic  Kerr-type 

nonlinear  media  and  show  that  they  support  families  of  stable  dipole-mode  solitons 

featuring two out-of-phase light spots located in different lattice rings. We show that the 

radial  symmetry  of  the  Bessel  lattices  afford  a  variety  of  unique  soliton  dynamics 

including controlled radiation-free rotation of the dipole-mode solitons.

The  basic  features  of  propagation  of  optical  radiation  in  media  with  transverse 

modulation  of  the  refractive  index  are  known  to  depart  considerably  from  those  for 

uniform  media.  Local  refractive  index  maxima  with  appropriate  characteristics  forms 

waveguides  that  enable  self-trapping  and  guiding  of  light  beams.  When  the  refractive 

index is modulated periodically, thus creating array of evanescently coupled waveguides, 

the formation of discrete solitons is possible in the neighboring array sites [1,2]. Discrete 

solitons  exhibit  a  number  of  unique  features  including  controllable  steering  and 

switching  that  makes  them  promising  to  demonstrate  all-optical  routing  concepts  [3]. 

Here  we  study  the  intermediate  regime  encountered  in  lattices  with  variable  refractive 

index  modulation  depth,  capable  of  operating  in  both  regimes  of  weak  and  strong 

coupling  between  neighboring  sites  [4,5].  The  concept  behind  such  regime  might  be 

termed  tunable  discreteness,  with  the  strength  of  modulation  being  the  parameter  that

tunes  the  system  properties  from  predominantly  continuous  to  predominantly  discrete. 

In  recent  landmark  experiments  it  was  showed  that  lattices  with  flexibly  controlled 

refractive  index  modulation  period  and  depth  can  be  induced  optically  [6-10],  which 

exhibits  a  number  of  advantages  in  comparison  with  technological  fabrication  of  the 

evanescently  coupled  waveguide  arrays.  The  properties  of  lattice  solitons  supported  by 

such kind of periodic lattices are being comprehensively investigated (see Refs [4-15]). 

The  possibilities  afforded  by  the  lattices  for  soliton  control  depend  crucially  on 

the lattice overall symmetry. In particular, the periodicity of lattices dictates the band-

gap  structure  of  the  existence  domain  for  lowest-order  solitons  and  their  low-power 

asymptotical  profiles  (Bloch  waves);  it  also  defines  the  permitted  configurations  of 

soliton  arrays,  and  the  symmetry  of  the  corresponding  field  distributions  (e.g.,  quasi-

discrete  vortices).  Therefore,  a  new  wealth  of  possibilities  is  open,  in  both  optics  and 

matter  wave  fields,  by  lattices  of  radial  symmetry  created  with  non-diffracting  Bessel 

beams. Those feature a cylindrical symmetry, thus new phenomena non-accessible with 

periodic (pixel-like) lattices. In this paper we address unique possibilities afforded by the 

Bessel  lattices.  In  particular  we  introduce  families  of  dipole-mode  spatial  solitons 

supported by Bessel photonic lattice imprinted in focusing cubic nonlinear medium and 

perform their stability analysis. We show that such dipole-mode solitons are stable under 

propagation  above  a  minimum  power  threshold,  and  we  illustrate  the  concept  of  the 

controlled rotation and reorientation of the dipole-mode solitons by an auxiliary control 

We consider propagation of optical radiation along  z  axis in a bulk cubic medium

This system was solved numerically with a split-step Fourier method in order to find the 

perturbation profiles and the corresponding growth rates. 

First we consider dipole-mode solitons that intuitively can be viewed as nonlinear 

superposition  of  out-of-phase  soliton  beams  supported  by  the  central  core  and  the  first 

lattice  ring.  Because  of  the  repulsive  interaction  between  the  out-of-phase  beams,  such 

localized states can not exist in the absence of Bessel lattice. The lattice compensates the 

repulsion and leads to stationary propagation. The typical profile of a stationary dipole-

mode  soliton  calculated  from  Eq.  (1)  by  relaxation  method  is  presented  in  Fig.  1(a). 

From  now  on,  these  solutions  will  be  referred  to  as  centered  dipole-mode  solitons.  The 

energy flow of centered dipole-mode soliton is nonmonotonic function of the propagation 

constant 

b

, as shown in Fig. 1(b). At high energy flows dipole-mode soliton transforms 

into  a  pair  of  narrow  non-interacting  bright  solitons.  When  b

→ ∞

,  the  total  energy 

flows  tends  to  twice  the  energy  of  the  so-called  Townes  soliton.  There  exist  a  lower 

cutoff 

cob

  on  propagation  constant  that  is  a  non-monotonic  function  of  lattice  depth 

(Fig. 1(c)). Close to the lower cutoff the dipole-mode solitons become spatially extended 

and cover several lattice rings. At approximately 

p ≤

8.2

 centered dipole-mode solitons 

cease to exist at lower cutoff without any topological transformation, while at 

p >

8.2

 it 

transforms  into  radially-symmetric  solutions  that  appears  as  a  bright  central  peak 

surrounded  by  concentric  rings  with  the  shape  of  the  linear  guided  mode  of  radially 

symmetric  Bessel  lattice.  This  transformation  of  the  asymptotical  soliton  shapes 

corresponds to the discontinuity in the  b

 dependence (Fig. 1(c)). Notice that with 

co( )p

growth of 

p

 the part of soliton energy carried out by the core decreases and at  p

→ ∞

 

most of the soliton energy is concentrated in the first lattice ring.

Our stability analysis revealed that centered dipole-mode solution becomes free of 

linear instabilities above certain energy flow threshold (above the corresponding critical 

value of propagation constant). The instability domain is located near the cutoff and the 

corresponding  perturbation  growth  is  of  oscillatory  type  (Fig.  1(d)).  Our  calculations 

reveal  that  the  width  of  the  instability  region  reduces  when  the  lattice  depth  grows. 

Close  to  cutoff  we  found  complex  narrow  stability  bands,  whose  detailed  study  falls 

beyond the scope of this paper, thus we do not display them in Fig. 1(d). 

Besides the centered dipole-solitons discussed above, we have found a new type of 

dipole-mode solitons, which are supported by the first lattice ring (Fig. 2(a)). Those will 

be  referred  to  as  ring  dipole-mode  solitons.  At  approximately 

p >

7.5

  such  solitons 

transform  into  linear  waves  at  lower  cutoff  and  their  energy  flow  vanishes,  while  at 

p ≤

7.5

 ring dipole-mode ceases to exist at cutoff without any topological transformation 

(Fig. 2(b)). As in the case of centered solitons this is accompanied by the discontinuity 

of  the  b

co( )p

  dependence  (Fig.  2(c)).  At  high  energy  flows  the  two  beams  forming  the 

ring  dipole-mode  solitons  become  very  narrow,  while  at  low  energies  they  spread  over 

the first lattice ring (Fig. 1(a)), so that their overlap becomes high. The same behavior 

is encountered with growth of the lattice depth at fixed energy flow. 

The linear stability analysis shows that ring dipole-mode solitons also turn to be 

completely  stable  above  energy  flow  threshold  (Fig.  2(d)).  Instability  band  is  located 

near  lower  cutoff  and  its  width  decreases  with  growth  of  the  lattice  depth  so  that  at 

p =

20

  ring  dipole-mode  solitons  become  stable  almost  in  the  entire  domain  of  their 

existence.  It  should  be  mentioned  that  at  critical for stabilization value of propagation 

constant, the two beams forming the ring dipole-mode soliton still overlap considerably. 

This indicates that stabilization is due to the lattice. Notice that, inside the instability 

bands, both oscillatory and exponential instabilities occur with ring dipole-mode solitons. 

The central new possibilities open by the Bessel lattices are linked to their radial 

symmetry, which makes possible to set solitons, and in particular dipole-mode solitons, 

into  controlled  rotation.  Rotation  of  the  so-called  centered  dipole-mode  solitons  can  be 

achieved  by  launching  one  component  trapped  in  first  lattice  ring  tangentially  to  the 

ring at an angle  α . Ring dipole-mode solitons can be set into rotary motion by imposing 

on them an initial phase twist  exp(

iνφ

)

, where  φ  is the azimuth angle and  ν  is stands 

for  the  so-called  winding  number  or  phase  twist  (Fig.  3).  In  contrast  to  solitons 

 

5

supported  by  periodic  lattices,  that  always  radiate  energy  upon  its  motion  across  the 

lattice  because  they  ought  to  overcome  opposing  potential  across  the  lattice,3  rotating 

dipole-mode solitons in Bessel lattices do not radiate. This property of solitons supported 

by Bessel lattices gives rise for a number of unique interaction types. 

For example, the symmetry-axis of the dipole-mode solitons can jump, e.g., upon 

the  action  of  an  additional  control  beam  launched  into  the  second  lattice  ring.  If  the 

energy flow of the control beam largely exceeds that of dipole-mode solitons, the control 

beam does not experience considerable displacement upon interaction, while the axis of 

dipole-mode solitons can rotate for angles up to 180 degrees. This concept is illustrated 

in Fig. 4, where the arrows show the direction of reorientation of the dipole-mode soliton 

axis and the direction of displacement of the control beam. The control beam is out-of-

phase with the dipole-mode soliton located in the first lattice ring. The direction of the 

rotation  and  its  rate  are  dictated  by  the  position  of  the  control  beam,  and  by  the 

relative  phase  between  the  control  beam  and  the  dipole-mode  soliton.  .  Notice  that 

nonlinearity is necessary for the observed behavior throughout the paper, because even 

though linear guided modes analogous to the ring dipole-mode solitons that we describe 

here  can  in  principle  be  supported  by  linear  Bessel  lattices,  their  rotation  is  always 

accompanied by radiation losses. 

 

In  conclusion,  we  have  revealed  properties  of  two  types  of  dipole-mode  solitons 

supported  by  radially  symmetric  Bessel  photonic  lattices  in  Kerr-type  cubic  nonlinear 

media. We showed that such solitons become completely stable above a minimum power 

threshold. Because of the radial symmetry of the lattice, we showed that the solitons can 

be set into controlled, radiation-free rotation, thus featuring a number of unique soliton 

dynamics.

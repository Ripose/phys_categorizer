Abstract 

A one parameter expression for the single ionization cross-section of atoms by electron 

impact is presented. Using this expression, the agreement obtained with available experimental 

data  for  45  elements  (from  ionization  threshold  up  to  200  eV  ionizing  electron  energy)  is 

shown  to  be  comparable  with  (or  better  than)  that  achieved  using  other  multi-parameter 

approaches.  We  suggest  that  the  single  parameter  used  here  is  associated  with  the  effective 

reduction in the number of equivalent electrons within a given shell accessible for ionization by 

electron impact. We attribute this reduction effect to intra-shell shadowing of part of the shell 
electrons  by  other  electrons  of  the  same  shell.  For  atoms  with  2s2pi  (i  =  3,4,5,6)  outer  shell 

configurations  we  suggest  also  an  inter-shell  shadowing  effect.  Finally,  we  discuss  the 

possibility of a meaningful contribution of inner shell ionization to the single ionization cross-

section  due  to  various  post-collision  interactions.  These  interactions  may  be  responsible  for 

decreasing the formation probability of doubly charged ions.

1.   Introduction 

 Electron impact ionization of atoms and molecules was studied during the last hundred 

years,  from  the  very  early  days  of  modern  physics  (see  Reviews  [1,2])  .Nevertheless,    the 

interest  in  this  field  has  hot  weakened  also  during  the  last  decade.  The  recent    theoretical 

studies of  Kim and Rudde and co-workers [3-7] and Deutsch and Märk and co-workers [8-12], 

as well as of  Rost [13], Saksena et al. [14], Khare et al. [15] and Joshipura et al. [15-16] should 

be mentioned along with numerous experimental studies (see, for example  Refs. [18-27]).An 

important  driving  force  for  these  studies  are  various  applications  such  as  electron  impact 

ionization  mass-spectrometry,  simulation  of  plasma  related  phenomena,  astrophysics  and 

astrochemistry etc. 

The  major  challenge  in  the  field  of  electron  impact  ionization  of  atoms  is  to  develop  a 

general  theoretical  framework,  which  will  provide  an  accurate  ionization  cross-section  for 

many  atoms  over  a  practically  relevant  impact  energy  range.  Due  to  its  complexity,  the  fully 

quantum-mechanical treatment of electron impact ionization of atoms is possible only for the 

simplest  cases  of  hydrogen  and  helium.  Even  in  these  cases  the  accuracy  in  the  low  energy 

range  of  E  ≤  100 Enl  is  quite  limited  (with  E  as  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  ionizing  (primary) 

electron and Enl  as the bond energy (absolute value of the full energy) of the atomic electron in 

the (nl) shell) [1]. With regards to heavier atoms, very recently Joshipura  et al. [16,17] have 

reported a quantum-mechanical numerical calculation of a total ionization cross section σ ion for 

electron  impact  ionization  of  halogen  atoms.  However,  the  calculations  were  actually  of  the 

total inelastic cross section σinel (including ionization and excitation for all allowed electronic 

channels).  The  transition  from σinel(E)  to σ  ion(E)  was  done  by  multiplying σ  ion(E)  by  some 

function  R(E).  The  specific  form  of  this  function  was  chosen  to  provide  best  agreement  of  

σ ion(E)  with experiment [17]. 

Given the limited success of the fully quantum treatment it turns out that various classical 

and  semi-classical  approaches  are  more  fruitful.    In  the  following  background  section    we 

review some semiclassical approaches aimed at calculating single ionization cross section σ +.  

The degree of agreement between calculated and experimental σ +(E) dependences is presented 

and the predictive power of the different approaches is discussed. We try to assess advantages 

and  disadvantages  of  the  different  approaches.  In  section  3  we  describe  a  parameter  free 

method  for  calculating σ  +(E).  In  section  4  we  present  the  central  part  of  the  paper,  a  single 

fitting  parameter  expression,  which  gives  a  satisfactory  agreement  between  calculated  and 

2

 

 

 

 

 

experimental σ +(E) dependences for 45 elements. The possible physical basis of this parameter 

is  discussed  in  section  5.  Finally,  in  section  6  we  consider  the  possibility  of  a  meaningful 

contribution of inner shell ionization to the single ionization cross section in terms of the (so-

called) post-collision interactions.

Let us assume that within the classical approximation the single ionization cross-section 

nσ+

(cid:65)  of the atomic electron shell (nl) is defined by only two parameters: the bond energy Enl and 

the ratio E/Enl.  From dimensional analysis (in atomic units) one then gets a general expression 

where f(E/Enl) is some function of the ratio E/Enl. Converting this expression to ordinary units 

for 

nσ+

(cid:65)  in the form: 

we obtain:

with  Ry  as  the  ionization  potential  (IP)  of  a  hydrogen  atom  and  ao  as  the  Bohr  radius.  One 

should  note  that  the  factor  π,  which  was  included  due  to  azimuthal  symmetry  of  the  cross-

section,  could  be  introduced  inside  the  function  f.  The  overall  cross-section  σ+  for  single 

ionization of an atom will be:

The  σ  +(E)  dependence  was  calculated  within  the  binary  encounter  model  for  the 

electron-atom collision, using both classical and semiclassical approaches [28-34].  However, 

one  should  note  that  in  Ref.  [29-34]  the  atomic  electron  was  characterized  not  only  by  the 

absolute  value  of  its  total  energy  Enl,  but  also  by  an  additional  parameter,  its  average  kinetic 

energy 

k

nE (cid:65)

.  Namely,  the  function  f  in  Eqs.  (2)  and  (4)  is  actually  a  function  of    two  energy 

ratios:   

f

≡

(
f E / E , E

(cid:65)

k
(cid:65)

(cid:65)

.

  Only  for  the  case  of  the  hydrogen  atom  the  equality 

k

nE

E=(cid:65)

n(cid:65)

 holds. However, Gryzinski [29] used this equality for all atoms such that in the final 

 

3

expression  for σ  +(E)  the  function    f   depends  only  on  the  ratio  E/Enl  as  in  Eqs.  (2)  and  (4).  

Burgess  [32,  33]  and  Vriens  [35-37]  combined  the  classical  binary  encounter  approximation 

with a quantum effect namely an exchange interaction (similar to Mott’s treatment of this effect 

[38, 39]).    They  have  argued  [32, 33, 35-37]  that  the  primary  (incoming)  electron  with  initial 

energy  E  gains  a  kinetic  energy W  before  it  interacts  with  the  atomic  electron.    The  function 

(
f E E , E

k
(cid:65)

)

  derived  by  these  authors  contains  the  general  factor  En/El  in  which  E  is 

replaced  by  E+W.    Burgess  [32, 33]  used  W=Enl  while  Vriens    [35-37]  argued  that 

k
W E
+(cid:65)
=
n

E

n(cid:65)

.  Since  then,  this  so-called  “acceleration  correction”  was  adopted  by  others  as 

well  and  introduced  into  several  electron  impact  ionization  models  (see,  for  example                

[4-6,  34]).    We  think  that  this  transition  from  E  to 

E

+

(

E

k
+(cid:65)
n

E

)
(cid:65)   overestimates  the 

n

“acceleration” effect.  The question rises due to the vague meaning of the expression “before 

primary  electron  interacts  (or  collides)  with  the  atomic  electron”,  specifically,  the  ill-defined 

nature of the word “before” in this context.  

To  clarify  this  issue,  let  us  consider    the  simplest  case  of  hydrogen  atom  ionization. 

Vriens  [35-37]  and  Ochkur  [34]  assumed  that  collision  occurs  at  the  crossing  of  the  primary 

electron trajectory and the orbit of the atomic electron. For the ground state hydrogen atom they 

used 

k
W E
=
s
1

+

E
1

s

=

2Ry

, namely here W is the absolute value of the potential energy of the 

atomic  electron  in  the  field  of  the  nucleus.  For  the  sake  of  clarity,  let  us  define  the  phrase 

“before collision” in terms of the relative position of the incoming electron with respect to the 

atomic  electron,  such  that  absolute  value  of  their  interaction  potential  energy  |U|  is  much 

smaller  than  the  bond  energy  Enl  of  the  atomic  electron.  For  the  hydrogen  atom  it  means 

|U|<<Ry.  The  condition  |U|~Ry  holds  when  the  incoming  electron  crosses  a  spherical  surface 

with radius 2ao (0.67 Ry < |U| < 2Ry).  One can therefore say that electron – electron collision 

occurs already at the 2ao  radius. Consequently, the condition |U|<< Ry holds when the distance 

between  the  incoming  electron  and  the  nucleus  is  much  larger  than  2ao.  However,  at  this 

distance the energy gain of the primary electron “before collision” with the atomic electron will 

be much smaller than e2/2ao ≡ Ry and certainly much smaller than 

( E
1

s

+

E ) 2Ry
=

. For the 

k
s
1

general case it means that the energy gain “before collision” with the outer shell electron has to 

be  much  smaller  than  Enl  + 

.  Indeed  Ochkur  [34]  and  Kim  et  al.[4-6]  (see  below) 

k

nE (cid:65)

empirically found that in order to improve the agreement between theory and experiment (for 

multi-electron atoms) one has to decrease the value of 

 by a factor of 4-5 [Ref. 34] or by a 

k

nE (cid:65)

4

 

 

 

 

 

factor of  n [Ref. 4-6], that is practically to set 

 as was done by Gryzinski [29]. We 

k

E≈(cid:65)

n(cid:65)

think  that  the  argumentation  given  above  is  providing  the  physical  basis  for  their  empirical 

conclusion.  

We will present here the expression for f(E/Enl) which was derived by Gryzinski [29].  As 

will  be  shown  later,  this  expression  leads  in  some  cases  to  a  rather  good  agreement  between 

calculated and measured σ +(E) dependences. This expression is given by:

From this point and on the function fG(x) will be called the Gryzinski function, while Eq.

In the limit of high electron energies E the generally accepted theory of atomic ionization 

is the quantum asymptotical (E/Enl>>1) theory by Bethe [40] (see also ref. [1]) that results in 

the following expression for

where C=(8/3)Ry, τ has a numerical value smaller than one and

of the (n ) shell. From Eq. (7) one can see that the Bethe function fB(E, Enl) is not a function of 
E/Enl  alone  but  also  includes  the  factor  E-1  common  for  all    shells.    Mann  [41]  suggested  to 

extend the use of the Bethe approximation to the range of small E values down to E=Enl. He 

has  simplified  and  modified  expressions  (6)  and  (7)  by  putting  4τ = 1  and  introducing  the 

fitting parameters Al and p, such that

where p=1 for l=0 and p=3/4 for l ≥ 1. Please note that the fitting parameter Al in Eq. (8) has 
dimension of [energy p] and therefore depends on l. However, it seems that Mann choose to use 

this factor with the same numerical value A for all l, such that

with  x≡E/Enl.  The  A  value  was  derived  by  equating  the  maximal  value  of σ  +  calculated  by     

Eq.  (9)  to  the  corresponding  measured  value  for  electron  impact  single  ionization  of  argon

l=0 and has the same numerical value (but in units of eV3/4) for l ≥1. 

Kim et al. [3-6] developed the binary-encounter-dipole (BED) model for electron impact 

ionization  of  atoms  and  molecules.  They  combined  the  modified  Vrien’s  symmetric  binary 

encounter theory [35-37] including interference between the direct and the exchange terms and 

the  Bethe  theory  [40]  for  fast  incident  electrons.  Their  final  formula  for 

n ( E )σ+

(cid:65)

does  not 

contain any fitting parameter but accurate experimental or theoretical data on photoionization 

cross-sections  of  (nl)-shells  are  required  in  order  to  derive  the  differential  dipole  oscillator 

strength for ionization. The BED theory gives very good agreement with experimental σ  +(E) 

dependences for several light atoms (H, He, Ne) in the range of IP ≤ E ≤ 104 eV but due to the 

lack  of  accurate  data  on  the  differential  oscillator  strength  for  the  majority  of  multi-electron 

atoms  it  is  practically  applicable  only  to  a  very  limited  number  of  atoms.  For  the  case  that 

nothing  is  known  about  the  differential  or  total  dipole  oscillator  strengths  a  simplified  model 

(the  Binary-encounter-Bethe  (BEB)  model)  was  proposed  [3].  This  BEB  model,  which  was 

applied also for some multi-electron atoms [6,7],  “leads  to ionization cross sections of correct 

orders of magnitude” [3].  

We would like to make one comment regarding the BED and BEB models: 

Kim  and  Rudd  have  elegantly  shown  [3]  that  the  differential  ionization  cross-section  dσ /dw 

(energy distribution of electrons after an electron – atom ionizing collision) can be represented 

as  the  sum  of  three  pairs  of  some  functions 

F ( t )[ f ( w 1 )

i

  with  relative

∑

energies  t=E/Enl  and  w=E2/Enl  (E2  is  the  ejected  electron  energy).    The  functions  fi(w+1) 

representing  the  ejected  electrons,    fi(t-w)  representing  the  scattered  electrons  and  their  sums  

are symmetric in w  within the [0, t-1] interval relative to its center. This symmetry is due to the 

indistinguishability  of  ejected  and  scattered  electrons  after  collision.  The  integrated  (over  w) 

cross  section  can  be  obtained  either  by  integration  of  each  pair  of  the  sum  over  the  

[0,(t  -  1)/2]  interval  or  by  integration  of  only  one  term  (irrespective  whether  the  first  or  the 

second one) of each (or any) pair in the sum within the [0,t - 1] interval (leaving out the other 

term of the pair). For example, the cross section σ  +(E)  in  the  binary-encounter-Bethe (BEB) 

model 

(formula 

(57) 

in 

ref. 

[3])  could  be  obtained  either  by

model (formula (55) in Ref. [3]), since the F3(t)f3(t-w) term in this model was left out [3] the 

integration of the other symmetric term F3(t)f3(w+1) of the third pair in the sum must be carried 

out over the interval  [0,t - 1]. Consequently, in Eq. (56) of Ref.[3] for 

D( t )

≡

the upper limit of the integral must be  (t – 1) and not ( t – 1)/2 (see also [15, 42]). This change 

results  in  some  underestimation  of  calculated  BED  cross-sections  σ  +(E)  relative  to  these 

presented in  [3] for H, He, Ne and H2 in the range of low E energies. 

Deutsch  and  Märk  [43]  introduced  a  modification  of  formula  (4).    It  was  suggested, 

quoting  from  ref.  [43],  “to  replace

fitting  factor  (named  a  weighing  factor  in  ref.  [43])  depending  only  on  orbital  quantum 

number  l.  The modified Eq. (4) (with fG) now takes the form:

It was suggested to set gs=3 (s electrons) and gl =0.5 (electrons with l ≠ 0) independent of 
the  electron  bond  energy  Enl.    The  contribution  of  s-electrons  to  σ +  is  therefore  6-fold  as 
compared  to  l≠ 0  electrons  (for  a  given  rmax  value).  As  will  be  shown  later,  the  σ +(E) 

dependencies  calculated  according  to  Eq.  (10)  for  a  number  of  elements  agree  with  the 

measured ones rather poorly.  To improve agreement with experiment Margreith et al. 

 [8] 

suggested to treat the weighing factor g in Eq. (10) as depending not only on l but also on n, Nnl 

and Enl such that the g factor used is given by

where  the  value  of  C(n,l,Nnl)  is  considered  to  be  a  free  fitting  parameter.    In  addition,  the 

Gryzinski function fG(x) (Eq. (5)) was modified by using additional fitting parameters (see also 

ref. [11]) which change its shape and maximum value, such that

For  each  of  the  s, p, d  and  f  orbitals  a  different  set  of  a, b, c, d  parameters  was  fitted.

where the a, b, c, d parameters depend on l. For the calculation of σ +(E) dependencies for 45 

elements  (refs.  [8, 11]),  a  matrix  with  50  fitting  parameters  C(n,l,Nnl)  was  used.    Combined 

7

 

 

with 4 sets of a, b, c, d parameters for s, p, d and f electrons the number of fitting parameters 

exceeded  60.  The  authors  of  Refs.  [8,11,43]  named  this  multi-parameter  approach  the  DM-

formalism∗.  

In what follows we will show that the σ +(E) dependence can be presented by Eq. (13)-

like  expression  but  without  any  fitting  parameters.  We  will  then  present  a  single  parameter 

expression,  which  will  allow  us  to  describe  experimental σ +(E)  curves  for  45  elements.  The 

possible  physical  basis  of  this  parameter  will  be  discussed.  The  agreement  achieved  between 

the calculated and measured σ +(E) curves using our method is comparable to (not worse than) 

that achieved by the DM-formalism using several tens of fitting parameters. 

3.  Calculation of σ +(E) without any fitting parameters 

Here we will show that the general expression (4) for the cross-section of electron impact 

ionization  can  be  reduced  to  the  form  of  expression  (13)  in  which,  however,  the  factors 

C(n,l,Nnl) are not fitting parameters any more. Namely, we show how an expression like that in 

Eq. (13) can be obtained in a systematic way, as opposed to the fully empirical approach in the 

DM-formalism.  We will start with Slater’s radial one-electron  wave functions Ψn [45]:

∗  Only  in  the  first  variant  of  the  DM  formalism  [43],  the  authors  correctly  define    the  (rmax)nl  in  formula  (10)  

(rn  in  [43])  as  radius  of  maximum  charge  density  in  line  with  the  numerical  values  that  were  used  in  ref.  [21].  

However,  in  the  following numerous  publications  (see for  example        [9,  11, 12])  using  as before  the  values  of 

radius of maximum charge density from Desclaux tables [44], the authors incorrectly named these values as root 

mean square radii (or 

 as mean square radius). Please note that if one is using in formula (13) the mean square

together  with  the  values  of  fitting  parameters  C(N,  l,Nnl)  from  table  in    [8]  or  table  1  in  [11]  or  [12],  then  the 
calculated values of  σ +(E)  will be overestimated compared with the  experimental ones by a factors of 1.5 ÷ 3.

In many cases the calculated values of rmax (using Slater’s rules) agree rather well with 

the Dirac-Fock calculation of rmax [44].  For example, Slater’s and Dirac-Fock values of  rmax 

for p- electrons agree within an accuracy of better than 10% and in many cases even better than 
3%.  For  filled  inner  s2-shells  the  agreement  between  Slater  and  Dirac-Fock  values  of  rmax  is 
also satisfactory. However, with regard to outer ns1 and ns2 shells and d-electrons, Dirac-Fock 

values  for  rmax  are  substantially  smaller  than  the  corresponding  Slater’s  rmax  values.  We  will 

show that this difference is highly important.

Comparing Eq. (13) and Eq. (17) we see their complete similarity with the exception that 

the factors Snl in Eq. (17) are not free fitting parameters anymore. 

If one now calculates the values of Zeff and n* according to Slater’s rules [45] (namely the 

values  of  rmax  and  Bnl),  then  Eq.  (17)  does  not  contain  any  additional  information  compared 

with Eq. (4).  For example, using the Gryzinski function fG (Eq. (5)) in Eq. (17) we will obtain 
the σ  +(E)  dependences,  exactly  as  calculated  by  Gryzinski  [29]  (Eq. (4)).  However,  if  one 

calculates the Snl factors according to Slater’s rules, but replaces Slater’s rmax values (Eq. (15)) 

with the more accurate Dirac-Fock values for rmax [44], a very different situation occurs.  In the 

case  that  the  Dirac-Fock  values  of  rmax  (for  the  shells  having  the  largest  contribution  to  the 
ionization  cross-section)  are  considerably  different  from  Slater’s  rmax,  the  values  of  σ  +(E) 
calculated  according  to  Eq.  (17)  will  be  quite  different  from  the  σ  +(E)  values  calculated 

according to Eq. (4) (using the fG function, for example). This situation takes place for example 

 

9

for transition and noble metals elements (see table 1), for which the σ +(E) values calculated by 

Gryzinski’s formula (4) are very much overestimated, as compared with experiment. The σ +(E) 

curves for single ionization of Fe, Ni, Cu and Ag calculated by Eqs. (4) and (17) (with the fG 
function) are presented in Fig. 1.  For comparison, the σ +(E) curves calculated according to the 

DM  formalism  [8,  11]  (Eq.  (13)  with  fitting  parameters  C(n,l,Nnl)  and  the  modified  

fG  (E/Enl,a,b,c,d)  function  (see  Eq.  (12))  are  also  plotted.    The  values  of  rmax  are  taken  from 

Dirac-Fock  calculations  [44]  and  the  values  of  Enl  for  the  outermost    s-  and  d-electrons  are 

taken  from  [46[  and  for  the  inner  shells  from  [47]    .  From    Fig.  1  one  can  see  that  the 

calculation with Gryzinski Eqs. (4) and (5) overestimate σ  +(E). The calculation of σ  +(E) by 

Eq. (17) (using Dirac-Fock  rmax values) without any fitting parameters agrees with experiment 

practically to the same degree as that using  the multi-parameter DM-formalism. The reason for 

the  dramatic  difference  between  the  σ  +(E)  values  calculated  using  Eq. (17)  and  those 

calculated using Gryzinski’s Eqs. (4) and (5) is the use of Dirac-Fock values for rmax instead of 

Slater’s values. Both of them are for the outermost electron shells of Fe, Ni, Cu and Ag atoms 

(most contributing to σ +(E)), are presented in Table 1 along with the corresponding values of 

the  

S (n,l,z) factors (Eqs. (17), (18)) and the analogous fitting parameters C(n,l,Nnl) (for Eq. (13)) as 

taken  from  refs.  [8,  11].    For  adequate  comparison  between  the  calculated  factors  and  the 

corresponding  fitting  parameters  C(n,l,Nnl),  the  last  ones  were  multiplied  by  the  ratios αl  of 

maximum  values  of  the  function  fG(x,a,b,c,d)  for  s-  and  d-electrons  [8,11]  to  the  maximum 

value  of  the  fG  function  equals  0.217  (see  Eq.  (5))  resulting  in αs=1.14  and αd=2.09.  From 

Table  1  one  can  see  that  in  some  cases  (as  for  d-electrons  of  Ag  or  s-electrons  of  Cu)  the 

factors  S  are  close  to  the  corresponding  values  of  αl·C(n,l,Nnl).  In  other  cases  they  differ 

considerably.  For  example,  the  contribution  of  3d-electrons  in  the  ionization  cross-section  of 

Fe, Ni and Cu, calculated by Eqs. (17), (18) is substantially overestimated as compared to the 

DM-formalism (Eq. (13)), while the contribution of 4s-electrons is somewhat underestimated. 
The parameter-free calculation of σ +(E) according to Eqs. (17), (18) (with fG as in Eq. (5) and 

Dirac-Fock rmax values) yields a rather good agreement with experiment for many elements. If 

we  quantify  the  agreement  in  terms  of  the  maximum  cross-section 

σ+

max( E )

  we  find  that  7 

elements agree with experiment to within  ± 10% (Li, Fe, Se, Br, Kr, Ag, I) and 11 elements 

agrees within ± 25% (H, He, Mg, Si, P, S, Cl, Ni, Cu, Te, Xe).  For other elements such as Na, 

Al, Ga, In, Cs, Pb there are experimental 

maxσ+ values that agree with the calculated ones within 

10

 

 

the range of ~15-20% as well as others with poorer agreement. A comparison of the calculation 

of σ  +(E)  according  to  Eqs.(17),  (18)  with  DM-formalism  will  be  considered  also  in  the  next 

section.

dependence will be different than the Bethe E-1fB(E/

with the Gryzinski function fG(E/Enl) used for the function f. The factor gl equals 1 except for 
filled or nearly filled shells with  l ≥1, for example for np5 and np6 shells or nd6÷nd10 shells.  In 

these  cases  the  factor  gl  (which  will  be  shown  later-on  to  have  a  clear  physical  meaning)  is 

treated  as  the  only  fitting  parameter.  The  choice  of  gl  =0.57  (for  l≥1  and  Nnl≥5)    in  Eq. (19) 
resulted in a sufficiently good agreement between calculated and measured σ +(E) dependencies 

for most of the data published until now. In Fig. 2a, b, c, d, e we present the calculated σ +(E) 

curves  (E ≤ 200 eV)  using  Eq.  (19)  for  45  elements  together  with  experimental  results.  Also 

presented,  for  the  sake  of  comparison,  calculated  σ  +(E)  curves  according  to  Gryzinski’s 

formulae (4) and (5), Mann’s equation (9) with three fitting parameters, and the two variants of 

the  DM-formalism:  Eq.  (18)  with  two  fitting  parameters  and  Eq.  (13)  with  several  tens  of 

fitting  parameters.  The  values  of Enl    for  the  outermost  shells  were  taken  from  Moor’s  tables 

[46] and for the internal shells – from Ref. [47] except for the cases of alkali atoms and inert 

gas atoms for which the 

 values of the shells, next to the outermost ones, were also taken 

nE (cid:65)

 

11

from  [46].  The  binding  energies  of  (n-1)s2  –electrons  for  alkali  atoms  (with  ground  state 
configuration (n-1)s2p6ns) were estimated as described in the Appendix.  

        Let us consider now the agreement of the calculations using the different approaches 

with  the  corresponding  measured  results.  Again,  to  a  first  approximation,  the  degree  of  this 

agreement will be given by comparing calculated and measured maximum cross-section values 

maxσ+

. In case that there are two or more experimental σ +(E)  curves for a given element (all of 

them  are  shown  in        Fig.  2)  we  will  evaluate  the  agreement  limits  (percentage  of  deviation 

from measured value) using the data that gives best agreement with calculation. First, we will 
consider  the  calculation  of  σ  +(E)  by  Gryzinski  (Eq. (4)  with  fG  as  in  Eq.  (5)),  which  is 

completely  parameter  free.  We  are  not  concerned  here  with  the  validity  of  the  various 

approximations used in deriving the function fG (for this matter, see for example comments in 

refs. [1, 34]). As can be seen from Fig. 2, for 15 elements (H, Li, Na, Mg, P, K, Ca, Ga, Se, Rb, 

Te, Cs, Ba, Pb, Bi) the value of  maxσ+

, calculated by the Gryzinski equations differs by no more 

than ~10% from the measured values.  As for the rest of the elements, 14 of them are within 

(12-30)%  of  the  measured  values  (He,  Al,  Si,  S,  Ge,  As,  Br,  Kr,  Sr,  In,  Sn,  Sb,  I,  Xe),  7 

elements are within   31-100%  (C, N, Cl, Ar, Ti, V, Hg) and for 9 elements (O, F, Ne, Fe, Ni, 

Cu, Ag, Yb, V) σmax is overestimated by a factor of 2.4 ÷ 4.7. 

As  for  Mann’s  formula  (9)  with  the  three-fitting  parameters,  a  major  drawback  is  the 

underestimated values of 

 for H and He (2.8 and 3.7 times correspondingly smaller than 

maxσ+

measured  maxσ+

). But at the same time  maxσ+ values for 24 elements (O, F, Na, Al, S, Cl, Ar, K, 

Ca, Fe, Ni, Cu, Ga, Br, Kr, Rb, Ag, I, Cs, Ba, Yb, Hg, Pb, Bi) are within ±10% agreement with 

measured values. This is much better than for the Gryzinski formula. 18 elements (Li, C, N, Ne, 

Mg, Si, P, Ti, V, Ge, As, Se, Sr, Sn, Sb, Te, I, Xe) lie within the (12-33)% agreement range. 

Very  large  overestimation  (similar  to  that  for  Gryzinski  formula)  is  found  for  uranium  for 

which the calculated  maxσ+ value is 2.5 times larger than the measured one. 

Next  we  will  consider  the  calculated  results  using  the  DM-formalism.  First,  we  discuss 

the two fitting parameters’ variant [43] (Eq. (10)). The two free parameters (weighing factors  

gs  =3  and  g(l≥1)=0.5)  were  fitted  to  obtain  the  best  agreement  between  calculated  and 
measured σ +(E) dependencies for ionization of noble gas atoms. Only for 15 elements (H, He, 

N, F, Ne, Na, Al, Ar, V, Cu, Kr, Ag, In, Xe and Pb) the calculated 

maxσ+ values agree with the 

measured values to within ±10%.  This is substantially worse than for Mann’s formula but it 

should be mentioned that the last one has one additional fitting parameter. 

 

12

Another characteristic feature of the first DM-variant is that for all elements with outer 

np-shells the calculated σ +(E) curve in the range of small E values (the rise region) is less steep 

than the measured one. Also, at the energy  E=Ens for the nearest ns-subshell there is a rather 
sharp  bend  in  the  calculated  σ+(E)  dependence  which  is  not  observed  experimentally.    This 

bend  is  particularly  distinct  for  the  elements  O,  F,  Ne,  Cl,  Ar,  Se,  Br,  Kr  (namely  for  the 
configuration  ns2pi  with  i=3,4,5,6).  This  artificial  feature  clearly  demonstrates  that  the 

proportion of weight factors gl for s- and p-electrons, as used in ref. [43], strongly overestimate 

the weight of s-electrons in the range of 

. This overestimation of go is clearly manifested 

maxσ+

also  in  the  overestimated σ  +(E)  for  alkali  and  particularly  (1.5-2  times  larger)  alkaline-earth 

metals.  On  the  other  hand,  the  underestimation  of  the  gp  factor  leads  to  underestimation  of 

calculated  maxσ+

 by 15-40% for most elements with unfilled outer p-subshell. 

The  second  variant  of  the  DM-formalism  (Eq.  (13)),  which  is  using  over  60  adjustable 

parameters, naturally yields the best agreement with experiment, as compared with the first DM 

variant,  Gryzinski’s  formula  and  Mann’s  formula  (at  least  according  to  the  criterion  of 

agreement between calculated and measured  maxσ+ values). We would like to remind the reader 

that  Eq.  (13)  (the  multi-parameter  DM  variant)  is  identical  in  form  with  Eq.  (17),  which  was 

derived by us, based on Slater’s wave functions and which has no adjustable parameters at all. 

Improving the agreement between calculated and measured σ +(E) values by using Eq. (13), as 

compared  with  Eq.  (17),  is  achieved  at  the  price  of  replacing  the  calculated  Snl  factors  in 

Eq. (17)  (defined  by  Eq.  (18))  by  free  fitting  parameters  C(n,l,Nnl)  in  Eq.  (13)  and  by 

simultaneous deformation of the fG function by adding another 4 parameters for each of the s, p, 

d, and f orbitals.  

Further comparison of the Snl factors and the C(n,l,Nnl) fitting parameters shows that the 

Snl    factors  in  the  Slater-formalism  depend  on  the  atomic  number  Z  (see  table  1  for  s-  and  

d-electrons), while the analogous C(n,l,Nnl) parameters in the DM-formalism are stated to be Z-

independent  for  completely  filled  subshells  [8,  11,  12].  The  justification  for  this  statement 

clearly deserves further examination. We will show that the Z-independence of C(n,l,Nnl) (for a 

given n) cannot be verified experimentally and merely reflects the fact that the contribution of 
the  inner  shells  to σ  +(E)  is  small.  The  Z-independence  of  C(n,l,Nnl)  parameters  is  assumed 
within  the  DM-formalism  [8,  11,  12]  for  filled  ns2,  np6  and  nf14  shells  and  also  for  d-shells 

occupied by any number of electrons. With regards to np6 shells, their contribution to 

maxσ+

 is 

the  largest  for  the  outermost  shells  of  the  noble  gases.  However,  for  the  next  elements  (the 

 

13

alkali and alkaline earth columns) the calculated contribution  of  the np6  shells  for  the  energy 

range  near  Emax  is  either  non-existing  (Na,  K,  Mg,  Ca)  or  quite  small  (Rb,  Cs,  Sr,  Ba).  For 

example, a change by a factor of 1.5 of the np6 contribution will change the 

maxσ+ value by no 

more than 5-20% (Rb, Cs, Sr, Ba). This change is within the spread in experimental results (Rb, 

Cs)  or  within  the  degree  of  agreement  of  calculation  and  experiment  (Sr,  Ba).  For  the  next 

(within  each  period)  elements  the  least  deep  np6-  shells  contribute  to σ  +(E)  only  at  electron 

impact  energies  E  much  higher  than  Emax  (corresponding  to 

).  Even  for  these  energies, 

maxσ+

again  the  degree  of  agreement  between  calculation  and  experiment  does  not  enable  one  to 

conclude  that  the  corresponding  parameters      C(n,  p,  6)  does  not  depend  on  Z.  Similar 

conclusions  can  be  made  also 

for  ns2  shells  and  d-electrons.  To  sum-up, 

the  

Z-independence of the parameters C(n, s, 2), C(n, p, 6) and C(n, d, 1÷10) (for a given n) within 

the  DM-formalism  cannot  be  established  experimentally.    Obviously  this  approach  is  only 

aimed at keeping down the already large number of adjustable parameters. 

It is interesting to note that the multi-parameter DM-formalism is the only approach that 

provides  satisfactory  agreement  between  calculation  and  experiment  for  σ  +(E)  of  uranium 

(50%  overestimation  of  calculated 

,  as  compared  with  the  measured  one,  while  all  other 

maxσ+

approaches are overestimating the measured 

 by factors of 2.5÷4.8 (see Fig. 2)). A closer 

maxσ+

inspection reveals that out of 6 C(n,l,Nnl) parameters used within the DM-formalism for the 6 
electronic shells (5d10f36s2p6d17s2), the bond energies of which lie below 200 eV, 4 parameters 

are specific only for uranium. These parameters are C(7, s, 2), C(6, d, 1), C(6, p, 6) and C(5, f, 

3) (see Eq. (13)). All these 4 parameters were chosen specifically for the corresponding shells 

of uranium and were not used for any other element. Actually, it can easily be shown that one 

can  choose  other  sets  of  these  4  parameters,  which  provide  much  better  agreement  between 

calculation and experiment than the set suggested in Ref. [8]. 

Finally, we would like to compare the measured σ  +(E) dependencies with the results of 

the calculation according to Eq. (19) containing a single parameter gl=0.57 for filled or nearly 
filled  electron  shells  with  l≥1.  The  calculated σ  +(E)  curves,  according  to  this  approach,  are 

given  in      Fig.  2  together  the  other  calculations  using  the  other  approaches  and  experimental 

results.    According  to  the  formerly  used  criterion  of  degree  of  agreement  (percentage 

difference) between calculated and measured 

maxσ+ values, we find that 30 elements (H, C, Na, 

Mg, Al, P, S, Cl, Ar, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, Cu,Ga,As, Se, Kr, Sr, Ag, In, Sb, Te, Xe, Cs, Ba, Yb, Hg, 

Pb, Bi) fall within the ±10% agreement range. For some elements out of this list (H, C, P, Cl, 

 

14

As, Se, Te) and also for Li and He (20% difference between calculated and measured values of 

maxσ+

)  the  calculation  of  the  σ  +(E)  dependence  for  the  E  range  around  Emax  is  free  of  any 

adjustable  parameter.  For  another  10  elements  (He,  F,  K,  Si,  V,  Ge,  Br,  Rb,  Sn,  I)  the 

agreement between calculated and measured values of  

  lies  within  the  (13÷30)% range. 

maxσ+

The agreement is worse for four light elements with principal quantum number 2 and electron 
configurations  2p3(N),  2p4(O),  2p5(F)  and  2p6(Ne).  For  N,  O  and  Ne  the  calculated  value  of 

maxσ+

  exceeds  the  measured  value  by  45-50%.  The  largest  difference  (factor  of   2)  between 

calculated and measured value is found for uranium. One should note that this is the case also 

for the Gryzinski and Mann equations and the first variant of the DM-formalism (see Fig. 2e). 

5.  On  the  origin  of  the  gl  (l≥1)  factor  –  Intra-shell  and  inter-shell 

shadow effects of atomic electrons during electron impact ionization.   

Let  us  consider  the  possible  physical  meaning  of  the  factor  gl  in  Eq.  (19).  Correct 

interpretation  of  this  factor  can  help  us  improve  the  agreement  between  the  calculated  and 

measured  σ  +(E)  dependence  and  can  also  provide  a  basis  for  a  more  elaborate  theoretical 

approach that will derive the gl  factor from fundamental principles. We remind the reader that, 

according  to  our  model,  the  factor  gl  ≠1  only  for  filled  or  nearly  filled  shells  with    l≥1.  For 

these  shells  gl  was  treated  as  a  fitting  parameter.  It  was  found  that  for  a  large  number  of 
elements  the  best  agreement  between  the  calculated  and  measured  σ  +(E)  dependence  was 

obtained with 

g(cid:65)

=0.57. We associate  the factor 

 with the effective decrease of the number 

g(cid:65)

Nnl of equivalent electrons of the (nl) shell accessible for ionization by impact of the primary 

electron.  We  suggest  that  this  is  due  to  effects  of  intra-shell  shadowing  of  part  of  the  shell 

electrons by other electrons of the same shell, such that (Nnl)eff = gl ⋅Nnl. Indeed, from a classical 

point of view, the “movement” of the equivalent electrons in the shell is constantly correlated, 

such that at each instant half of the electrons in a filled shell reside on the frontal hemisphere 

(as  “seen”  by  the  approaching  primary  electron)  and  thus  are  screening  (for  the  primary 

electron) the second half of the electrons in the back hemisphere. Under the extreme condition 

of full shadowing (shielding) of the back electrons, only frontal electrons (e.g., half of the filled 

shell  electrons)  are  subjected  to  ionization  by  the  incoming  electron,  resulting  in  a  singly-

ionized atom. In this case, the factor g for completely filled shells equals 0.5.  In all other cases, 

when shadowing is not complete, one should get 0.5<g<1. 

Let us discuss now the behavior of gl for different shells. With regard to filled ns2-shells, 

the correlated movement of the two electrons means that appreciable shadowing of one electron 

15

 

 

by  th

e  other  can  take  place  only  for  the  unique  orientation  where  both  of  them  are  situated 

along  the  approach  line  of  the  primary  electron  (or  close  to  it).  Since  such  orientations 
constitute  a  small  part  of  all  possible  orientations,  the  effect  of  intra-shell  shadowing  for  ns2 

shells,  can  be  neglected.  Following  similar  arguments,  one  can  neglect  intra-shell  shadowing 

effects  for  np-shells  with  Nnp ≤ 4.  To  estimate  the  intra-shell  shadowing  for  np-shells  with 

Nnp = 5, or 6 we will use a rather crude model of shadowing. For a filled p-shell one can assume 

that  three  electrons  out  of  six  always  reside  on  the  frontal  hemisphere  (as  viewed  by  the 

incoming  electron)  and  therefore  are  not  subjected  to  any  shadow  effects.  At  the  same  time, 

each  of  these  3  electrons  shadows  a  certain  part  β  of  each  of  the  3  electrons  in  the  back 

hemisphere. The effective number of electrons (Nnp)eff  accessible for ionization by the primary 

electron can then be given by the expression 

(Nnp)eff. = 3+3{1-β-(1-β)β-[1-β-(1-β)β]β}. 

(20) 

On the other hand, within our model w

e have found (Nnp)eff. = 0.57 Nnl for filled shells. 

Takin  this into account and 

g

using Eq. (20) we get β6=0.48  (the  subscript  is  standing  for  the 

numb

er of electrons Nnp in the shell and here for Nnp=6). 

In order to find (Nnp)eff for Nnp=5 one has to take into account that in this case either 2 or 3 

electrons  can  populate  the  front  hemisphere.  Accordi

ngly,  3  or  2  electrons  in  the  back 

hemis

phere can be shadowed. Writing an expression similar to Eq. (20) for this configuration, 

one can use (zero order approximation) the already calculated β6 as β5 and thus find for the first 

case (Nnp)eff = 2.81 and for the second case (Nnp)eff = 3.28. The average value is (Nnp)eff = 3.04 

and gp(Nnp=5) = (Nnp)eff / Nnp = 0.61. 

Clearly, the shadowing coefficient β depends on the number of electrons in the shell. We 

neglect  the  shadowing  effect  for  Nnp

  ≤  4,  while  we  find  that β6  =  0.48.  Therefore,  using  the 

value

  of β6  for β5  as  was  done  above,  we  overestimate  the  shadowing  effect  for  shell  with  

Nnp  =  5.  The  value  gp(Nnp=5)=0.61  that  was  obtained  is  thus  a  lower  boundary  and  actually 
gp(Nnp = 5) > 0.61. Indeed, as can be seen from Fig. 3, calculating σ  +(E) using Eq. (19) with 

gp(Nnp = 5) = 0.61  instead  of  the  former  gp = 0.57  value  yields  a  somewhat  better  agreement 

with the measured values for Cl, Br and I (five p-electrons in the outermost shell). However, an 

even  better  agreement  with  experiment  is  achieved  using  gp  (Nnp = 5) = 0.7,  in  line  with  the 

argument presented above regarding the lower limit of gp(Nnp = 5).  With regard to  nd  electron 

shells  with  Nnd  ≥  6  one  can  expect  that  0.5  ≤  gd  ≤  0.57,  where  the  minimal  value  of  gd 
corresponds to full shadowing of half of the filled  nd10  shell (by the other half shell) and the 

 

16

maximum value of  gd  is taken to be the same as for six electrons in np6-shells.  For simplicity 

we use the value of gd = 0.57 independent on Nnd. 

In what follows we would like to present and discuss a specific electronic configuration 

that does not obey the conclusions derived from the intrashell shadowing effects. Included in 

this group are the F, Ne, N and O atoms, as presented in Fig. 2a. Using  gp  =  0.61  instead  of  
gp = 0.57 for the fluorine atom (2s2p5 configuration) is actually increasing (rather than reducing) 
the  disagreement  between  calculated  and  measured  σ  +(E)  curves.  Also  for  the  neon  atom 
(2s2p6) with fully filled outer shell using the factor gp = 0.57 yields a large overestimation of the 
measured σ +(E). The last finding for fully filled shell is in sharp contrast with the situation for 
Ar  (3s2p6),  Kr (4s2p6),  and  Xe  (5s2p6)  for  which  gp=0.57  gives  a  good  agreement  between 

calculation  and  experiment  (±  10%  agreement  for 

maxσ+

).  Also  the  N (2s2p3)  and  O (2s2p4) 

atoms, for which gp=1 according to the proposed model, do not obey the former conclusions. 
One can therefore generalize and conclude that elements with outer shell configurations 2s2pi 

(i=3,4,5,6) exhibit a clear exception to the general agreement between calculated and measured 

σ  +(E) as achieved by our standard model. A possible explanation to this unique behavior can 
e found by examining the features of radial electron density distributions for outer shells 2s2 

b

and  2pi  (i=3÷6)  in  comparison  the  distributions  for  the  shells  ns2  and  npi  (i=3÷6)  with  n ≥ 3.  

According  to  Desclaux’s  tables  [44],  the  value  of    rmax    for  2pi-shells  is  smaller  (by  4  ÷7  %) 
than  rmax  value for 2s2-shells.  Namely, 2s2 electrons can be viewed, to some extent, as outer 
electrons  relatively  to  electrons  of  2pi-shells.  For  n ≥ 3  the  situation  is  the  opposite,  ns2-
electrons are always “inner” electrons relative to npi-electrons. Therefore, it is possible that on 

the  average  one  of  the  “outer”  2s  electrons,  residing  between  the  incoming  electron  and  2p-

electrons, partially shadows these p-electrons. If we now introduce the coefficient βinter for the 

intershell shadow caused by this outer 2s-electron on each of the inner 2p-electrons, then: 

 

(N2p)eff = (1 – βinter) gp (N2p) ⋅ N2p                           (21) 

As a crude approximation we will assume that βinter is equal to β6 = 0.48, found 
above for 
hell  shadowing  for  np6-shells.  We  would  like  to  remind  the  reader  that  according  to  

intras

Eq.  (20)  gp (Nnp = 6) = 0.57,  gp (Nnp = 5) = 0.61  and  gp  (Nnp ≤ 4) = 1  (please  note  that  in  this 

simple model the only fitting parameter is β6 = 0.48 in Eq. (20)). Then from formula (21) we 

obtain (N2p)eff = 1.78 for Ne, (N2p)eff = 1.59 for F, (N2p)eff = 2.08 for O and (N2p)eff = 1.56 for N. 
Measured  and  calculated  σ  +(E)  dependences  (using  Eq.  (19))  for  n=2  outer  shel

nts are presented in Fig. 4. The thin solid lines are presenting calculations with gp = 0.57 

for Ne, gp = 0.61 for F and gp = 1.0 for O and N, namely taking into account only the intrashell 

17

 

 

shadow effect for Ne and F. The thick solid lines stand for the calculation (using Eq. (19)) with 

the  additional  intershell  shadowing  effect  of  2p-electrons  by  one  of  the  2s-electrons,  namely 

using the factor (1-βinter) = 0.52 in the definition of (N2p)eff.  according to Eq. (21).  It is clear 

that taking the intershell shadowing effect into account results in considerable improvement of 

the  agreement  between  the  experiment  and  the  calculation.  For  the  fluorine  atom  the  factor 

gp(N2p=5)  =  0.61  was  used.  As  was  noted  above,  this  value  is  a  lower  boundary  and  actually 
gp(N2p=5) > 0.61. For the elements with outer shell configuration np5 with n ≥ 3 (Cl, Br, I) the 

best agreement with experiment is achieved with gp = 0.7 (see Fig. 3).  If we use this value in  

Eq. (21) for the fluorine atom together with  1-βinter = 0.52 we obtain (1-βinter)⋅gp = 0.364.  The 
result of the calculation of σ +(E) for the fluorine atom using this factor is presented in Fig. 3 by 

a dashed line, which is in better agreement with experiment. 

6.  On  the  inner  shell  contribution  to  the  atomic  single  ionization  

cross-section    

The  contributions

ioniza

tion  cross-section  a

re  pres

ented  separately  in  Fig. 2.  As  can  be  seen,  for  several  atoms 

(such as Fe, Ni, As, Se, Br, Kr, Te, I, Xe) taking into account single ionization of these shells 

results in considerable improvement of the agreement between the measured σ +(E) dependence 

and  calculated  one,  as  given  for  example  by  the  expression  of  Mann  (Eq.  9)  or  our  one-

parameter  Eq.  (19).  The  better  agreement  is  manifested  by  the  shape  of   σ  +(E),  mainly  the 

high-energy tail behavior.  

However,  a  singly-ch

arged  ion  formed  following  inner  shell  ionization  is  highly  over-

excite

d  with  respect  to  the  inner-shell  vacancy  and  therefore  should  be  relaxed  via  an  Auger 

process  resulting  in  the  formation  of  a  doubly-charged  ion.  The  calculated  lifetime  of  M45 
vacancies  in  Se+,  Br+,  Kr+  and  N45  vacancies  in  Te+,  I+,  Xe+  is  about  6.5 ⋅ 10-15  sec.  (with  a 

corresponding level width Γ ~ 0.1 eV) [69]. During this time the singly charged ion (having a 

vacancy in its inner shell) cannot escape the ionization zone and therefore should be registered 

as a doubly charged ion. This conclusion implies that inner shell ionization cannot contribute to 

the cross-section of a singly charged ion production and is therefore in disagreement with our 

conclusion (see above) that inner shell ionization contributes meaningfully to single ionization 

cross  section σ  +.  In  order  to  reconcile  this  (seemingly)  contradiction,  one  has  to  assume  the 

existence  of  some  process  that  reduces  the  formation  probability  of  the  doubly-charged  ions 

 

18

due to Auger relaxation of ions with inner shell vacancy. The effect of this hypothetical process 

has  to  be  manifested  also  by  a  decreased  yield  of  Auger  electrons,  as  compared  with  that 

expected  based  on  the  ionization  cross-section  of  the  inner-shells  under  consideration  (other 

possible mechanisms, such as autoionization, will be briefly discussed later). 

The  last  conclusion  can  be  examined  using  the  data  in  Refs.  [21,70-72]  where  the 

σ+
(cid:65)

n ( E )  dependence for the production of M45 vacancies in Kr atoms and N45 vacancies in Xe 

atoms a

re presented over the energy range which is of interest here. The 

n ( E )σ+

(cid:65)

measurements 

in all these studies are based on measurements of the corresponding yield

s of A

uger electrons. 

From the data presented in Refs. [21,70-72] it is clear that the ionization  cross-sections for 3d-

shell of Kr and 4d-shell of Xe are much smaller than those predicted by Mann’s expression (8) 

and our one-parameter expression (Eq. (19)). At this point we would like to remind the reader 

that the last two expressions provide a rather good agreement with the experimental σ +(E) for 

transition  metal  atoms  with  a  large  contribution  of  outer  3d  and  4d  shells  (see  Fig.  1).  For 

example,  for  M45  vacancies  of  Kr,  the  experimental  value  is 

σ+ (200  eV)  ~  1.75 ⋅ 10-18  cm2 

3d

[70, 71] while the calculated value of 

3dσ+ (200 eV) is 3.2 ⋅ 10

-17 c

m2 according to Eq. (19) or 

1.1 ⋅ 10-17 cm2 according to Mann’s expression (8). For N45 vacancies in Xe the measured cross 

section  is 

σ+ (200  eV)  =  1.3 ⋅ 10-17  cm2  [21,  72],  while  the  calculated  value  is  

4d

4dσ+ (200 eV) = 9.2 ⋅ 10-17 cm2 according to Eq. (19) and 3.9 ⋅ 10-17 cm2 according to Mann’s 

expr

ession (8). Following these comparisons, one can conclude that indeed the measured yields 

of Auger electrons resulting from the ionization of 3d- and 4d-shells are substantially reduced 

as compared with the yields predicted by the ionization cross-sections of these shells calculated 

according to formulae (8) or (19). 

We  suggest  that  the  kind  o

f  processes  that  may  be  responsible  for  the  decrease  in 

probability  of  Auger  transitions  (leading  to  the ejection  of  Auger  electrons  and  generation  of 

doubly-charged ions) are associated with a variety of post-collision interactions (PCI) [73-75]. 

During the process of ionization of the bound electron there is some probability that either the 

inelastically  scattered  electron  or  the  directly  ionized  (atomic)  electron  will  be  moving  so 

slowly that at the instant of the Auger transition this slow electron will still be at the vicinity of 

the atom. The subsequently emitted fast Auger electron will overtake this slow electron, which 

will suddenly be subjected to the filed of a doubly charged ion. The slow electron can then be 

recaptured,  resulting  in  the  formation  of  an  excited  (Rydberg  state)  singly-charged  core.  The 

probability for this process is larger in the near-threshold (for inner-shell ionization) range of 

 

19

the  ionizing  electron  energy  E.  The  above  mechanism  described  in  the  literature  for  the 

interaction  between  the  Auger  electron  and  the  slowly  outgoing  electron  is  experimentally 

manifested by a shift of the Auger peak (in the energy spectrum of the secondary electrons) and 

the tailing towards the high energy side [73-75]. 

However,  one  may  consider  another  possibility  where  the  slow  electron  is  actively 

partic

ipating  in  the  Auger  process.  The  energy  released  during  the  filling  of  the  inner  shell 

vacancy  is  transferred  to  this  slow  electron  and,  as  a  result,  the  slow  electron  turns  to  be  the 

“fast” Auger electron, leaving the singly charged ion. The energy spectrum of such “converted” 

electrons has to be very broad because of their initial continuous energy distribution (before the 

instant of filling the vacancy) and to some extent also, due to the lifetime of this vacancy in the 

neutral  system,  consisting  of  a  singly-charged  positive  ion  and  a  slowly  outgoing  electron.  

Observing this possible process by detecting these smeared energy electrons against the large 

background of the inelastically scattered or the ejected electrons (with a broad and continuous 

energy distribution) is not an easy task. An additional background contributions is usually not 

an experimental feature that can be detected accidentally. It is possible that due to this reason, 

the proposed process was not yet discussed in the literature. The probability of this process can 

be quite high, even for large distances between the atom and the slowly departing free electron, 

due to a strong overlap between wave functions of initial and final states of the outgoing (free) 

electron. This situation closely resembles the process of direct Auger relaxation of an excited 

atom  in  the  vicinity  of  a  metal  surface  (Auger  de-excitation)  [76,77].  Within  this  collisional 

process the energy released by the de-excitation of the atom into its ground state is transferred 

by  an  Auger  mechanism  to  one  of  the  conduction  (nearly  free)  electrons  of  the  metal.  It  was 

found  [76,  77]  that  for  dipole  transitions  in  the  atom  this  process  is  very  long  range  with  a 
power  law  distance  dependence  (R-4)  of  the  transition  rate  (rather  than  the  usual  exponential 

one). Finally, one should also note that there are atoms, such as Si, Ga, Ge, In, Sn, Sb, Te, I, 
Xe,  Hg,  Pb,  and  Bi,  for  which  inner  shell  contributions  to  σ  +(E)  with  Enl ≥ 100 ÷  150  eV 
calculated by Eq. (19) lead to overestimation, as compared with the experimental σ +(E) for the 

relevant (high) energy range of E (see Fig. 2).  One can assume that in these cases the Auger 

decay of the inner shell vacancies results in the production of multicharge ions.  It seems that 
this is the case also for less deep inner shells (with Enl ≈ 20-60 eV) of atoms with outer  ns2  

configurations such as Mg, Ca. Sr, Ba. 

Some contribution to the integral single ionization cross-section 

σ +(E) can be given also 

by  an

  autoionization  process.  The  autoionizing  states  are  created  via  excitation  of  more  than 

one electron or via the formation of a vacancy in any inner shell followed by transition of the 

 

20

electron  of  this  shell  to  one  of  the  unoccupied  states  and  an  Auger  relaxation  resulting  in  a 

single charge ion production. For example, for the case discussed above of the Xe ionization, 
the question addressed is the creation of N45 vacancy resulting in the configuration 4d95s25p6ns 

(n ≥6). The lowest of these excited states is the 6p state whose excitation energy is 65 eV [46]. 

Indeed, the bend in the experimental σ +(E) dependence (see Fig. 2), which can be attributed to 

N45 vacancies, appears at an energy value (E ≈ 60 eV) below the energy needed for the creation 

of N5 vacancy  (with  direct ionization  of  the  atom)  which  is  67.5  eV  [46].  It  is  quite  possible 

that in the range of 60 eV ≤ E ≤ 65 eV, excitation of the Xe atom to the excited configuration 

4d95s25p6ns (n≥6) takes place. 

Kim et al. [4] associated the second maximum in the σ +(E) dependence (see Fig. 2d and 
5)  for  a  rubidium  atom  (ground  state  configuration  4s2p65s)  with  the  autoionizing 

Fig. 

excitation  of  the  4p  core  electrons.  Using  the  plane-wave  Born  approximation  they  have 
calculated the contribution of these autoionized states to the integral yield of Rb+ ions. As can 

be  seen  from  Fig. (5),  in  the  range  of  E  =  40–100  eV  the  contributions  of  the  autoionizing 

excitations 4p →  4d  or  5s  or  5p  to σ+(E) is 2.7  ÷1.4  times  higher  than  direct  core  ionization 
(4p6 and 4s2 shells). At the same time, the direct core ionization in this energy range is 19-65% 

of the 5s-shells direct ionization cross section.

than the one calculated within the plane wave Born approximation, as presented in Fig. (5). A 

very  similar  structure  in  the  low  energy  region  of  the σ  +(E)  dependence  exists  also  for  the 

ionization of  K and Cs (see Fig. 2).

  Summary 

Reliable  models 

for  the  energy  dependent  single  ionization  cross-section  of  atoms  by 

electr

on  impact  constitute  a  basic  pre-requisite  for  any  quantitative  modeling  of  processes 

involving  energetic  electrons  and  neutral  atoms  or  molecules.  Unfortunately,  it  seems  that 

 

21

currently available models are either very difficult to apply for most elements or lack predictive 

power.  In  this  paper  we  have  critically  reviewed  and  analyzed  some  currently  accepted 

approaches. We have then suggested a one-fitting-parameter expression that was shown to be in 

good  agreement  with  most  of  the  measured  cross-sections  reported  in  the  literature  (from 

ionization threshold up to 200 eV ionizing electron energy). The agreement obtained between 

our one-parameter method as presented here and the experimental result, is at least as good as 

that obtained by other methods using from several to tens of fitting parameters.  

We have discussed the physical basis of the single parameter used. We  propose that this 

param

eter  is  associated  with  the  effective  reduction  in  the  number  of  equivalent  electrons 

within  a  given  atomic  shell  accessible  for  ionization  by  electron  impact.  This  effective 

reduction  was  crudely  modeled  (classically)  in  terms  of  intra-shell  shadowing  of  part  of  the 

shell electrons by the other electrons in the same shell. Elements with outer shell configuration 
2s22pi  (i  =  3,4,5,6),  namely  N,  O,  F  and  Ne  atoms,  exhibit  a  clear  exception  to  the  general 

agreement between calculated and measured cross-sections. The required minor changes in the 

fitting parameter (effective reduction in the number of electrons accessible for ionization) for 

these elements were rationalized in terms of sp inter-shell shadowing. 

A  fully  parameter  free  expression  was  also  derived,  based 

on  Slater’s  formalism. 

Howe

ver,  agreement  with  experiment  is  less  satisfactory  as  compared  with  the  one  achieved 

using the one-parameter expression. 

We have also discussed the con

tribution of inner shell ionization to the single ionization 

cross-

section. For several atoms, taking into account single ionization of inner shells leads to 

better  agreement  between  measured  and  calculated  cross-sections.  The  better  agreement  is 

mainly manifested in the shape of the high-energy tail of the cross–section (100-200 eV). For 

other atoms, contributions due to deeper inner levels may lead  to  overestimation  of  the  high-

energy tail of the cross-section. We suggest that a variety of post-collision interactions (some of 

them already discussed in the literature) can explain the contribution of inner shell ionization to 

the single ionization cross-section. One possible mechanism involves the recapture of a slowly 

outgoing  electron  resulting  in  the  formation  of  an  excited  singly  charged  core.  The  other 

process  we  describe  is  basically  Auger  de-excitation  of  an  over-excited  atom  where  a  slow 

electron is actively participating in the Auger process.

Appendix 

There is some problem finding the binding energies for the inner  (n-1)s2 – electrons of 
alkali atoms with electron configurations  (n-1)s2p6ns. Dirac – Fock calculations by Desclaux 
[44] of the binding energies for  (n-1)s2 – shells are larger by ~ 10.5 eV than the corresponding 
values given by Lotz [47] (see 5th column in  Table A1). Here we shall estimate these binding 

energies  using  the  following  simple  procedure.  Let  us  consider  a  three  stage  process  starting 

from a ground state alkali atom and leading to double charged ion in the excited configuration  
(n-1)s p6  :

(A2) 

The  energy  needed  for  the  first  transition  in  process  (A2)  is  the  binding  energy  of  an 
electron in the inner  (n-1)s2 – shell, which is the one we are interested in. The second transition 

in  (A2)  is  ejection  of  ns  –  electron  from  single  charged  ion  having  vacancy  in  the  

(n-1)s – shell. The energy needed for this transition is not known. However, one can expect that 

for an alkali element with atomic number  Z  this energy is close to the one needed for ejection 

of    ns  –  electron  from  the  singly  charged  ion  of  element  with  atomic  number    Z+1  and 
configuration (n-1)s2p6ns . The basis for this assumption is that the effective charge (according 

to  Slater’s  rules  [45])  acting  on  the  ns  –  electron  in  alkali  ion  with  atomic  number    Z    and 
configuration (n-1)s p6ns  is very close to that in an alkaline earth ion with atomic number  Z+1  
and configuration  (n-1)s2p6ns , namely 3.05 and 3.20 correspondingly. The IP values of ground 
state ions with atomic numbers  Z+1 taken from Ref. [46] are presented in the 4th column of 

Table A1. Using these IP values instead of the energies needed for the second transition in the 
process (A2) together with the (A1) process energies given in the 3rd column in Table A1, one 

can  calculate  the  energies  needed  for  the  first  transition  in  the  process  (A2).  These  are  the 
binding energies of the alkali atoms (n-1)s2  electrons as listed in the 5th column. For the sake of 

comparison, the corresponding values from Desclaux [44] and Lotz [47] data are also presented 

at the same column.

Fig. 5.  Electron impact single ionization cross-section σ +(E) calculated for the Rb atom. The 
thick solid and dashed lines represent the total single ionization cross-section σ +(E) and partial 
5sσ+ (E)  cross-section  as  calculated  by  formula  (19)  and  by  the  5s-term  in  this  formula 
correspondingly. The total single ionization cross- section σ +(E) calculated by Kim et al. [6] is 
5sσ+ (E)  (BED  theory  [3,6])  is  given  by  the  thin 
given  by  the  thin  s
dashed  line.  The  difference  between  the  thin  dashed  line 
d  the  dotted  line epresents  the 
contribution of direct ionization of core electrons and the difference between the dotted line and 
the  thin  solid  line  represents  the  contribution  of  autoionization  of  Rb  atoms  with  excited  
4p-core electrons [6]. In order to properly compare between σ +(E) calculations by the different 
approaches,  all  Enl  values,  used  in  these  calculations,  were  taken  from  Ref.  (6).  The 
experimental  data  are  from  Zapesochnyi  and  Aleksakhin  [55]  (●)  (gross σ  +),  from  Nygaard

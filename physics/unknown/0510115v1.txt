An exact calculation of the retarded electric field in the source region of a system of individual charges, 
expanded to third order in velocity, shows that all nonrelativistic accelerated charges in a system emit 
dipole electromagnetic energy at the Larmor rate.  In general, some of the emitted dipole power is reab-
sorbed by doing work on other charges in the system, and some is radiated.  If the system has zero net 
dipole moment, all the emitted dipole power is reabsorbed, and none is radiated.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

  A solitary accelerating charge produces dipole (and higher 
order  multipole)  electromagnetic  radiation.    But  a  system  of 
neighboring  accelerating  charges  that  has  zero  net  electric 
dipole moment produces no dipole radiation. 
  Each  accelerating  charge  in  a  system  of  charges  has  no 
information  about  the  instantaneous  net  electric  dipole  mo-
ment of the system.  At every instant, therefore, each acceler-
ated charge must expend electromagnetic energy at a rate that 
depends only on its own acceleration, and that is independent 
of  the  acceleration  of  other  charges  in  the  system.    Each  ac-
celerated  charge  expends  electromagnetic  energy  at  the  Lar-
mor  rate.    This  paper  analyzes  what  happens  to  that  electro-
magnetic power after it is emitted, that is, whether it becomes 
radiated or absorbed. 
  What happens to the dipole electromagnetic power emitted 
by each accelerating charge in a  system  with zero net dipole 
moment?    Does  radiated  power  become  undetectable  or  un-
physical by destructive interference?  Or is the power  some-
how switched off at the source?  Or, as has been suggested for 
a different context [1], does electromagnetic energy flow from 
large  radius  into  the  source  region?    This  paper  provides  an 
answer based  wholly on physics  in the source region, an an-
swer  that  avoids  the  usual  explanations  of  interference  of 
fields in the far (radiation) zone. 
  Equally of interest is what happens when N parallel, iden-
tical  neighboring  dipoles  undergo  an  identical  acceleration.  
Then the total dipole electromagnetic power is not N times the 
2N .    From  where 
power  radiated  by  a  solitary  dipole,  but 
does the extra electromagnetic power come? 
  This  paper  calculates  the  work  done  by  accelerating 
charges  on  each  other  in  a  simple  system  having  zero  net 
dipole moment.  The work done on each charge accounts for 
the  vanishing  dipole  radiation  from  each  charge.    And  when 
the dipole moment of a simple system of charges is doubled, 
then the work done by the charges accounts for a quadrupling 
of power radiated from the system. 
  These insights into the question of vanishing dipole radia-
tion  may  not  seem  surprising.    Perhaps  more  surprising, 
though,  is  that  the  nonrelativistic,  velocity-independent  Lar-
mor  power  vanishes  from  a  system  having  zero  dipole  mo-
ment owing to a high-order relativistic correction to the elec-
tric field. 
 
In  the  nonrelativistic  limit,  the  Larmor  (dipole)  radiation 
power  is  known  to  be  independent  of  particle  velocity.    The 
instantaneous  Larmor  power  from  an  accelerating  charge  is 
about the same for a motionless charge as for one traveling at 
one-tenth  the  speed  of  light.    Yet,  in  order  to  show  that  the 
work  done  by   a  system  of  charges  with  zero  net   dipole

moment  accounts  for  vanishing  dipole  radiation,  we  must 
calculate the rate of work to order 
 , where    is the ratio 
of particle speed to speed of light, c. 
  The  Larmor  power  radiated  by  a  solitary  accelerating 
charge  can  be  derived  simply  from  first  principles  within  a 
factor of order unity.  Consider two identical masses that un-
dergo identical accelerations, but one is charged and the other 
is not.  A greater force must be applied to the charged mass to 
produce the same acceleration, because the electrostatic field 
energy of the charged mass must be accelerated with the mass 
[2–4]. 
  Suppose  a  charge  q  is  given  an  acceleration  a  during  a 
t extends 
t .  The field that is accelerated during 
brief time 
to a radius  c t .  The electrostatic field energy that has not yet 
been  accelerated  during 
 .    This 
c t
unaccelerated  electrostatic  energy  has  an  equivalent  mass 
.  The work to be done by the radiation field on this 
m
equivalent  mass  to  accelerate  it  to  speed  a t   is  about 
.  And since this radiation was produced in a time

Viewed  in  this  way,  Larmor  radiation  is  seen  to  be  an  ac-
counting  mechanism  that  adjusts  electromagnetic  fields  at  a 
distance  to  correspond  to  the  state  of  their  source.    This  ap-
proximate derivation is discussed further in Sec. V. 
 
II.  MODEL 

  Next, we consider a system of charges in which the magni-
tudes  of  both  the  accelerations  and  the  velocities  of  the 
charges remain constant.  The charges are caused to move in 
circular  orbits  of  radius  b  at  constant  angular  frequency .  
2b .  
The  constant  magnitude  of  centripetal  acceleration  is 
The constant magnitude of tangential velocity is  b . 
  This  model  is  useful  in  its  simplicity.    Such  a  model  is 
simpler to treat than a model of parallel, coherently oscillating 
electric dipoles, owing to the constant magnitudes in uniform 
circular motion of such quantities as ranges, speeds, accelera-
tions,  kinetic  energies,  rates  of  work  done  on  other  charges, 
radiated powers, etc. 
  A  similar  model  of  symmetrically  distributed  charges  in 
uniform  circular  motion  has  been  used  for  related  calcula-
tions.    The  model  was  used  to  calculate  radiated  power  and 
the radiative reaction force to low orders in   [6], and to cal-
culate the exact radiated power in certain external electric and

2q  revolving on

1q  is also shown at the 

 
magnetic  fields  [7].    In  this  paper,  the  relativistic  model  is 
used to calculate the exact rate of work done by one charge on 
another,  and  to  show  how  the  dipole  electromagnetic  energy 
expended  by  each  accelerating  charge  is  partitioned  between 
radiation and work done on other charges in the system. 
  As shown by a textbook calculation [8], and later empha-
sized  for  just  this  sort  of  model  [9],  care  must  be  taken  in 
calculating  the  radiated  power  of  multipoles  higher  than  di-
pole.    Relativistic  effects  contribute  to  radiation  at  higher 
order  terms  in     not  only  through  harmonics  in  the  funda-
mental frequency   , but also in relativistic modifications to 
the  nonrelativistic  multipole-radiation  formulas  [9],  like  Eq. 
(1).  This caveat does not apply to the rate of work calculated 
in this paper of charges on other charges, which is correct to 
all orders of  , and does not apply to radiation calculations if 
one  considers  only  lowest-order  dipole  radiation,  which  is 
sufficient for the purposes of this paper. 
  Many  approaches  can  be  used  to  show  what  ultimately 
happens to the electromagnetic power emitted by accelerating 
charges.  For example, a general derivation of electromagnetic 
conservation laws has been based on the freedom to consider 
charge and current sources subdivided in different ways [10].  
For the particular calculation of this paper, however, the most 
instructive approach has been deemed to be an explicit exact 
relativistic  calculation  of  work  done  by  charges  on  other 
charges in a system. 
  Consider the configuration shown in Fig. 1.  Two charges, 
2q , are caused to revolve clockwise in a circular orbit 
1q  and 
at constant speed, such that 
.  Since the charges are 
/b c

on  opposite  sides  of  the  circular  orbit,  their  velocities  are 
always equal and opposite.

If the charges

is  a  linear  combination  of  a  monopole  moment,  2q

where 
LP , defined in Eq. (1), is the Larmor power that would 
be  radiated  by  each  of  the  accelerated  charges  without  the 
other. 
  Thus, if the net dipole moment vanishes
, the total 
power radiated by the simple system of charges in Fig. 1 is a 
factor  of 
  less  than  the  dipole  power  that  would  be 
radiated  by  each  charge  alone.    To  find  out  why  the  dipole 
radiation  vanishes  for  this  simple  system,  we  calculate  the 
work  done  on  each  charge  by  the  other.    By  symmetry,  the 
work done by 
2q  on 
1q .    Therefore,  we  only  need  to  consider  the  field  at 
q t produced by 1q  at the retarded time  t .  We only need to 
2 ( )
consider the electric field, since the magnetic field can do no 
work.    And  we  only  need  to  consider  the  component  of  the 
electric field in the direction of motion of 
2q  (the y direction 
in Fig. 1), since that is the only component that can do work 
at time t.  By rotational symmetry and constant angular veloc-
ity, whatever rate of work is done on 
2q  at time t is the same 
for all time.

rate of work done by each charge on the other is equal to the 
nonrelativistic  Larmor  power

  This  system  of  two  charges,  having  zero  dipole  moment, 
produces no dipole radiation.  Each charge does work on the 
other  at  the  same  rate  (the  Larmor  power)  that  work  is  done 
on  it.    Suppose  the  system  is  a  nonrelativistic,  frictionless 
spinning wheel, with two equal point charges fixed on oppo-
site sides of the circumference of the  wheel.  The  wheel  can 
only  lose  kinetic  energy  by  producing  radiation.    The  only 
radiation it can produce, however, is from the quadrupole and 
higher  multipole  moments.    Therefore  from  Eq.  (2),  the  me-
chanical  power  needed  to  sustain  a  constant  angular  veloc-
ity  of the frictionless wheel with zero dipole moment is less 
than LP  by a factor 10 times smaller than

motion  of

The total power radiated from this system is  4 LP .  Therefore, 
the mechanical power needed to sustain the constant angular 
velocity  of  this  frictionless  system  must  be  4 LP   or  2 LP   per 
charge, since that  much power is carried away  from the sys-
tem by radiation.

Although  the  expression  for  the  electric  field  in  Eq.  (3)  is 
exact  everywhere,  including  the  source  region,  the  field 
within  the  source  region  cannot  even  be  considered  to  be  in 
the “near (static) zone,” which begins only at a distance much 
greater than  2b  [15].  In this discussion, therefore, “emitted 
dipole  power”  refers  to  the  rate  of  loss  of  electromagnetic 
energy from a charge, whether by radiation or by work done 
on other charges, and “absorbed dipole power” refers only to 
the  rate  of  work  done  by  the  fields  of  charges  in  the  source 
region, and not to any radiation process.

  So,  what  happens  to  the  dipole  electromagnetic  power 
emitted by each accelerating charge in a system with zero net 
dipole  moment?    The  analysis  gives  a  clear  answer.    Each 
charge  in  such  a  system  emits  power  at  the  Larmor  rate,  as 
though  it  were  alone.    But  all  of  the  emitted  power  gets  ab-

sorbed by doing work on other charges.  None of the emitted 
dipole power gets radiated from a system with zero net dipole 
moment. 
  This conclusion is very different from supposing that elec-
tromagnetic power does not even get emitted from accelerat-
ing charges in a system with zero dipole moment, or that the 
dipole power somehow gets switched off at the source.  That 
supposition  might  suggest,  for  example,  that  there  is  no 
broadening of spectral lines  from radiative reaction in a sys-
tem with zero net dipole moment. 
  Neither is it helpful to suppose that the dipole power emit-
ted from charges in a system with zero dipole moment is radi-
ated, but that the radiation is cancelled by destructive interfer-
ence in the far (radiation) zone.  That supposition might sug-
gest  that  positive  energy  densities  of  the  radiation  fields  of 
each of the charges are somehow annihilated in the far zone. 
  The same conclusions hold true for a system of antennas, 
which  is  just  equivalent  to  a  system  of  accelerating  charges.  
The  electromagnetic  field  in  the  immediate  neighborhood  of 
an antenna was calculated in [16].  For example, consider two 
identical  parallel  dipole  antennas,  each  emitting  the  same 
dipole power 
antP  at the same frequency.  If the two antennas 
are  exactly  out  of  phase,  then  the  dipole  power  emitted  by 
each is absorbed by the other, and no net dipole power is radi-
ated from the system.  The power of each antenna is absorbed 
by the electric field of each antenna doing work on the current 
antP .  In that case, the dipole radiation 
in the other at the rate 
resistance of each antenna is zero [17]. 
  Next,  consider  the  same  two  dipole  antennas,  but  each 
emitting 
antP  exactly in phase.  Then the electric field of each 
antenna does work against the current in the other at the rate 
antP .  In that case, the dipole radiation resistance is doubled in 
each antenna, and the dipole power radiated from the pair of 
antennas is four times the power that would be radiated from 
each antenna in the absence of the other. 
In  the  introduction  to  this  paper,  the  approximate  Larmor 
 
power formula was derived from first principles.  That deriva-
tion  raises  some  interesting  fundamental  questions  about  the 
mass-energy of electromagnetic fields and about the radiative 
reaction force.   
2 / 8E   
  The energy density of a static electric field  E  is 
[18].    This  energy  density  has  an  equivalent  mass density of 
2
c .    For  example,  the  equivalent  mass  of  the  electric 
/ 8E
field of a static charge q outside a radius R is 
Rc .  This 
mass  is  a  real  physical  quantity.    The  distributed  mass  of  an 
electromagnetic  field  even  attracts  other  masses  gravitation-
ally [19].  The mass of the electromagnetic field differs from 
the mass of the charged particle that produced it, however, in 
that it is distributed over space, and not localized at the parti-
cle. 
 
It  is  the  finite  speed  c  of  disturbances  to  the  distributed 
mass  of  electromagnetic  fields  that  gives  rise  to  radiation 
from accelerated charges.  From the derivations in this paper, 
it is easy to see that in the limit  c   , the power radiated by 
an  accelerated  charge  vanishes.    In  this unphysical  limit,  the 
static  field  of  a  charge  would  move  rigidly  everywhere  with 
the  charge,  and  would not  do  work  on  its  self  field.    And  in 
this unphysical limit, presumably the mass of the field would 
effectively be included in the mass of the charge, because any 
acceleration  of  the  mass  of  the  charge  would  produce  an  in-
stantaneous  acceleration  of  the  entire  mass  of  the  distributed 
field. 
  Since  c  is  not  infinite,  the  mass  of  the  electromagnetic 
field is easily distinguished from the mass of the charge that 
produced it.  That is why a greater force must be applied to a

charged particle to produce the same acceleration as an iden-
tical uncharged particle.  Both the mass of the charged parti-
cle  and  the  mass  of  the  electromagnetic  field  beyond  the 
charged particle must be accelerated. 
  Another  way  of  looking  at  the  fact  that  a  greater  force  is 
needed to produce the same acceleration of a charged particle 
as  an  identical  uncharged  particle  is  to  recognize  that  the 
charged  accelerated  particle  produces  radiation,  and  the  un-
charged  particle  does  not.    Conservation  of  energy  therefore 
requires that more work be done on the charged particle than 
on  the  uncharged  particle  to  produce  the  same  acceleration.  
The additional force that is needed to produce the same accel-
eration of a charged particle as an identical uncharged particle 
is  known  as  the  radiative  reaction  force  [20].    In  the  model 
presented in this paper, the radiative reaction force is provided 
to the system by the mechanical force 
c  that keeps the 
system rotating at constant velocity, even as energy is radiated 
away. 
  Since the dipole power radiated by a source depends on the 
work done by charges on other charges in the source region, 
one  might  expect  that  modifications  to  the  source  region 
might  affect  the  radiated  power  just  as  modifications  to  the 
source would.  For example, an experiment was recently pro-
posed  to  demonstrate  that  “almost  all  far-field  power  can  be 
provided  by  evanescent  waves”  by  modifying  the  index  of 
refraction in the neighborhood of a radiating dipole [21].   
  As  another  example,  certain  laser-target  plasmas  in  vac-
uum have no electric dipole moment.  But because just a part 
of  the  poloidal  electron  current  passes  through  an  overdense 
plasma  plume,  where  the  electromagnetic  power  emitted  by 
the  current  is  converted  to  electroacoustic  waves,  dipole 
power  is  radiated  from  the  other  part  of  the  current,  even 
though  the  poloidal  current  has  no  electric  dipole  moment 
[22].   
  An  analogy  to  this  process  would  be  if  one  of  the  two 
charges  in  Fig.  1  were  shielded.    Then,  even  if  the  charges 
were  equal,  so  that  the  system  had  no  dipole  moment,  the 
unshielded  charge  would produce  dipole  radiation because  it 
could do no work on the shielded charge. 
 
In conclusion, an exact calculation of high-order relativis-
tic corrections of the electric fields of dipoles in their source 
 

regions  accounts  for  dipole  power  radiated  in  the  far  field.  
The Larmor power emitted by each dipole in a system of zero 
dipole  moment  is  absorbed  by  doing  work  on  the  other  di-
poles in the system.    And in a system of N parallel identical 
dipoles  oscillating  in  phase,  each  of  the  dipoles  must  work 
against the retarded fields of all  the other dipoles in the sys-
tem.  Each dipole therefore radiates N times as much power as 
2N  times as 
a solitary dipole would, and the system radiates 
much as a solitary dipole.

Abstract. Ab initio quantum chemistry reveals how the charge-antisymmetric antihydrogenic HH+ state, 
deriving from conventional positional antisymmetry of a 3-unit charge system, is hidden in the PEC 
(potential energy curve) of the molecular hydrogen cation. Only with internal charge inversion and 
Coulomb’s law, the anti-symmetry generated by positional coordinates can be understood but this solution 
was persistently overlooked. Stabilizing matter-antimatter interactions not only exist in nature, they are an 
essential element, even in wave mechanics, for explaining stable composite matter with a Coulomb model.

Introduction 
 
Stating that matter-antimatter systems must not annihilate [1] contradicts the so-called matter-
antimatter asymmetry of the Universe [2]. Recent claims on the production of neutral antimatter 
(artificial antihydrogen H) [3] boosted work on matter-antimatter interactions like H-H to calculate 
their PECs (potential energy curves) [4]. Yet, these HH PECs are contradictory on the issue of 
cusp formation, despite the highly sophisticated quantum mechanical calculations used [1,5].  
Anti-symmetry is important for the stability of quantum systems but it can be due to positional 
coordinates (parity P), spin symmetries (S), charge symmetries (C)… With intra-atomic charge-inversion, 
one expects stable charge-symmetric HH to transform in unstable and exotic charge-antisymmetric HH [1]. 
We now verify how a trivial Coulomb anti-symmetry scheme is hidden in the framework of wave 
mechanics for the molecular hydrogen cation (charged 3-particle Coulomb system). Historically, 
the wave mechanical analysis for this charged two center system, as well as for neutral 3-unit charge 
one center Coulomb system He, proved decisive for the development of quantum mechanics for 
many particle systems [6]. We focus on the simplest bond imaginable, charge-symmetric hydrogenic 
cation HH+, extensively studied theoretically and experimentally [6] and on charge-anti-symmetric or 
antihydrogenic cation HH+, unknown in the early days of wave mechanics. 
 
Coulomb-based antisymmetry in the molecular hydrogenic cation 
 
Anti-symmetry by intra-atomic charge inversion invariantly leads to a parity operator (algebra) 
within the 2-center 3-particle Hamiltonian for the molecular hydrogen cation 
 
 
 
exactly as for 2-center 4-unit charge system H2 [1]. The result for the cation is simpler, since there 
are only 4 terms, instead of 10 for H2 [1], and only 2 Coulomb terms are perturbing, since 
(1b) 

 
The + solution applies for charge-symmetric hydrogenic HH+, the negative for charge-anti-symmetric 
antihydrogenic HH+. Lepton-nucleon separation rA appears in H0 for neutral atom H or H 
(Coulomb potential energy –e2/rA), whereas lepton-nucleon separation rB appears in a perturbing 
term, just like nucleon-nucleon separation rAB in both Hp+ and Hp+. The proton is at the second 
center because of the total cation charge.  
Many will find it difficult to accept that an exotic antihydrogenic state like HH+ is needed to account 
for the stability of the observed molecular hydrogen cation [1]. Hence, (1a) must also be tested

with wave mechanics to see if it makes sense. It is obvious from (1b) that the observed PEC of the 
cation must be checked for a the presence of a cusp, pointing to a switch from repulsive charge-
symmetric +e2/rAB for HH+ to attractive charge-anti-symmetric –e2/rAB for HH+, in order to validate 
(1b) and the many drastic consequences it may have [1].  
 
Generic Coulomb cusp for matter-antimatter antisymmetry 
 
Finding a signature for a (reversible) but discrete hydrogen-antihydrogen transition of type 
 
between two mutually exclusive states for interacting nucleons, anywhere in the observed PEC of the 
molecular hydrogen cation, is essential. This makes (1c) of crucial importance to validate [1]. It would 
be nice if we could predict exactly where transition (1c) must occur and how this could be 
understood with first principles, say the classical Coulomb law. 
To understand the formation of a molecular hydrogen cation, two different asymptotes are 
required. Their difference is an energy gap of –½ Hartree, i.e. H0=-½e2/rA=-½e2/a0 in (1a). With 
separation R between the unit charges in au, the scaled variable is D=R/a0. Obviously, Coulomb 
attraction ~–1/D sets in at asymptote 0 for infinite separation, whereas repulsion ~+1/D must 
set in at asymptote –1/2 Hartree, giving interaction  

(1c) 

 

 

 

 

W+(D)=–½+1/D= -½(1-2/D) 

(1d) 
which approaches the zero asymptote from below. By Coulomb symmetry (parity ±1), the 
associated attractive interaction approaches the same zero asymptote from above or  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1f) 

W±(D)= ±(1-2/D)  

W-(D)= -(-½(1-2/D))= ½(1-2/D).  

(1e) 
Similarly, the scaled classical Coulomb interactions viewed from the zero asymptote now 
becomes repulsive +2/D for hydrogenic HH+ and attractive –2/D for antihydrogenic HH+. 
The general naïve Coulomb picture for (1a) is completely described with PECs obeying 
 
the basis of our discussion of (1b) and to be confronted with wave mechanics (see below). 
The four classical PECs of type W(D), e.g. ±2/D and ±(1-2/D) for unit asymptotes ±1 instead 
of ±½ as in (1d) and (1e), are depicted in Fig. 1a with variable D and in Fig. 1b with 1/D [7]. 
This is the rather trivial effect of the Coulomb law for 2 unit charge systems. In either scheme, 
the zero asymptote is reproduced exactly by summing conjugated Coulomb PECs like +2/D-
2/D=0. In this sense, one would conclude that matter would annihilate with anti-matter 
although, strictly spoken, only the pair-wise conjugated point charges, deriving from an imposed 
Coulomb model to describe the particles, are annihilated (see below).  
Yet there are differences between representations with and without asymptotes +1 and –1, 
connected by the parity operator P, deriving from interacting charges or from C:  
(i) Unlike the model with the zero asymptote, only the model with 2 asymptotes ±1 is capable of 
predicting a cusp for the system. By symmetry, this Coulomb cusp is theoretically fixed exactly at 
2D, i.e. R=2a0, which is also exactly the observed equilibrium separation of the molecular hydrogen cation [6].  
(ii) And if this generically predicted cusp for the cation makes sense, the two asymptotes must 
make sense also. This means in concreto that the quantum state with asymptote +1 applies to 
antihydrogenic HH+, whereas asymptote –1 is valid for the quantum state with hydrogenic HH+. But 
this also means that both states (or asymptotes) HH+ and HH+ are required to understand the naturally 
observed molecular hydrogen cation, e.g. its Coulomb cusp. These bold but inescapable conclusions from 
(1a)-(1c) must be confronted with wave mechanics (see below). 
 
Cusps with generalized Coulomb interactions 
 
Changing from potential energies ±1/D to forces ±1/D2 (or to any conjugated pair of another 
type1 of interaction ±1/Dn, even enforced or attenuated symmetrically…) will never alter 
                                                 
1 In this sense, an interaction varying as D0, D1, D2…(like Hooke’s law), cannot be excluded a priori [7].

conceptually the PEC behavior in Fig. 1 for a stable unit system, since the generic cusp at D=2 is 
always conserved by symmetry. For instance, we could easily mimic a slowly attenuated 
interaction using a continuously varying function like e-D (see further below). 
Whatever the degree of attenuation or whatever the value of n in 1/Dn, the position of the Coulomb cusp remains 
invariantly at D=2. This mechanism can become an important trompe-l’oeil effect in the interpretation of PECs 
for stable systems [7b]. In particular, a generic cusp at D=2 in any PEC can always be interpreted as deriving 
from Coulomb charge-anti-symmetry and its two conjugated asymptotes or Coulomb quantum states ±1. As soon 
as the pure Coulomb law is not obeyed exactly, the zero asymptote is no longer reproduced by adding attractive and 
repulsive branches and, instead, a PEC of type W(D) will have to appear around the zero asymptote. Only an 
asymmetry in the repulsive and attractive branches can, eventually, also distort the position of the Coulomb cusp. 
With Fig. 1, the anti-symmetry problem due to intra-atomic charge inversion obeying Coulomb’s 
law is quantitatively well defined classically. We must analyze in detail the observed and calculated 
PECs for unit charge Coulomb systems, charge-conjugated cations HH+ and HH+, verify if a generic 
cusp at D=2 like in Fig. 1 can be detected and, finally, how this is interpreted with wave 
mechanics.  
 
Coulomb splitting with 2 quantum states ±1: ionic or covalent bonding models 
 
Coulomb recipe (1f) is one of the oldest examples of 2 charge-conjugated quantum states +1 and 
–1 possible for a neutral system. In essence, it is a recipe for describing a neutral system at the 
zero asymptote (say axis x) with the help of two new asymptotes (virtual or real) at ±1, obtained 
after symmetrically unfolding the origin along the y-axis if the system is on the x-axis. This creates an extra 
symmetrical biaxial reference frame to describe the system. 
The oldest application in chemistry is ionic bonding between cation A+ and anion B-, interacting 
by means of Coulomb’s law –1/rAB. As discussed in full elsewhere [7], the complete PEC for this 
interaction has an attractive branch for a charge-antisymmetric system (ion-anti-ion system) 
following –1/rAB, whereas its repulsive branch for the charge-symmetrical system follows +1/rAB 
with a cusp at rAB=2r0, the equilibrium separation. This is the basis of an ionic approximation to 
chemical bonding. In first order, this ionic PEC can be generated very easily with the Kratzer 
potential, even for covalent molecules [1,7]. 
In contrast to ionic bonding schemes, covalent bonding, proposed by Heitler and London [8], explains bonding 
directly from the zero asymptote, i.e. seemingly without any assistance of the Coulomb asymptotes ±1, typical for 
ionic bonding and, finally, also seemingly without the recipe provided by (1f) and the PECs as described in Fig. 1. 
This is why ionic bonding models were immediately abandoned and superseded with the Heitler-London (HL) 
model, published in 1927, although we argued that this may well have been an unjust decision [1]. 
This controversy on chemical bonding (covalent or ionic) can now be made very concrete: does wave mechanical HL 
theory rely or not on the Coulomb PECs with asymptotes or quantum states ±1, respectively for the atom-atom 
and the atom-anti-atom states as depicted in Fig. 1? 
In fact, we will show below that, despite all appearances, even wave mechanical HL-theory is 
based upon this very same classical Coulomb recipe (1f) and its old fashioned ionic but generic 
PECs as depicted in Fig. 1. To prove this analytically, we only need a simple transparent example 
of quantum mechanical Heitler-London bonding, which is provided with the one lepton two 
center molecular hydrogen cation. 
 
Ab initio wave mechanical calculation of the PEC for the hydrogen molecular cation 
 
To retrace the essentials of the PECs in Fig. 1 in a wave mechanical framework, we need a 
standard calculation with straightforward interpretation of all terms evaluated. Fortunately, 
Pauling and Wilson [6] proposed a very transparent wave mechanical analysis for HH+, similar to 
that used by Heitler and London for H2 [8] and which we will therefore use here in the greatest 
detail. This PW-model [6] analysis starts with the typical secular equation

Since there is only one lepton, spin symmetries must not be considered to secure anti-symmetry 
of the total wave function for a 2 center 2-lepton system like H2 [1,6]. We must only verify if 
there is a correspondence between anti-symmetry generated by positional coordinates or by 
charge inversion2 (when charge-symmetrical state H e-p+ goes over in charge-anti-symmetrical H e+p-, as 
in (1c) and as argued in [1]).  
Following [6], we introduce eigenvalue WH, given by 
 
reminding this relation should, in a reasonable first approximation, apply for both H and H [1].  
Due to the relative simplicity of the cation, all integrals are easily calculated analytically [6]:

already introduced above for the construction of the Coulomb schemes in Fig. 1. 
We notice that, without further differentiation by scaling, proton-proton repulsion +e2/rAB would be 
exactly canceled by the attractive term –e2/rAB in J (but see further below).  
Similarly 
HBA = ∫ u1s(B)(WH –e2/rB +e2/rAB)u1s(A)dτ

2 It is important to realize that in the 1930s [6], the concept of antiparticles in the newly developed theory of the H2 
chemical bond by Heitler and London in 1927 [8] was much too new to be incorporated as a possibility for bonding, 
as remarked in [1].

With all integrals available, standard solutions (3) follow immediately. Exponential e-D in (8) could 
eventually attenuate Coulomb interactions without affecting the position of the cusp at D= 2 (see 
above). 
In the PW scheme, most if not all terms for the nucleonic interaction are repulsive +e2/rAB. This 
will make it difficult, if not impossible, to find evidence for the reality of cusp (1c) at D=2 and 
for the antihydrogenic asymptote explicitly needed for attractive –e2/rAB to make sense.  
In the hypothesis that the hydrogenic molecular cation be denoted as HH+ (or H2

as illustrated in Fig. 42-2 of [6]. Splitting of bonding and anti-bonding states is caused by virtue of 
the 2-center exchange or resonance integral ±K (also called overlap), although K itself is a continuous 
function in the range 0<D≤+∞. If so, K itself cannot be responsible for a cusp. Also overlap S is 
a continuous function in the same range, devoid of any cusp.  
A conventional W, D representation for S and A solutions (9) is given in Fig. 2, which illustrates 
the achievements of wave mechanics for this problem [6]. The solutions, unknown in classical 
physics, seem to derive solely from quantum theory. Pauling and Wilson repeatedly argue that 
Heitler and London used a similar procedure [8] to explain H2 bonding with wave mechanics, a 
solution we revisited recently [1]. 
The cusp problem (1c) can only be solved by adding/subtracting some of the primary integrals 
above (1/D, J, K, S…). The PECs generated by all integrals are given in Fig. 3 to verify that all 
are rather continuous without any cusp. 
To illustrate also the behavior of functions HAA (5a) and HAB (7a), we give their PECs in Fig. 4. It 
is evident that by adding them a cusp will be formed in the end but HAA is continuously repulsive 
whereas HAB is attractive at long range but becomes repulsive at shorter range, indicating that 
cusp formation in wave mechanics relies solely on HAB. 
After some mathematical manipulation (scaling and shifting it to asymptote zero instead of WH), 
it is easily shown that WS in (9a) leads to a rather cryptic end result 
W’S =+2{S/D + e-D[e-D(1+1/D)-(1+D)]}/(1+S) 

(9c) 

 

 

 

which can hardly be recognized with classical physics. This PEC is given in Fig. 2. It does not 
bear any resemblance with the elementary even trivial Coulomb functions (1f), given in Fig. 1. 
Equations like (9c) were considered as a triumph for wave mechanics in the case of H2 [6], as they 
seemed to be completely out of reach for classical physics. This, however, happens to be a 
misjudgment [1], as we show below.  
Our proof relies mainly on scaling. If, for instance, we would have scaled (9a) and (9b) with 
absolute3 |WH|= |e2/2a0|, the mathematically correct scaled versions are 

WS/|WH|= -1 +2/D + 2(J+K)/(1+S) 
WA/|WH|= -1 +2/D + 2(J-K)/(1-S)

suggesting indeed, just like everybody would have expected, that wave mechanics exclusively uses 
the repulsive interaction +e2/rAB, typical for the HH+ asymptote for the molecular hydrogen 
cation and, therefore, would have excluded asymptote +1 for HH+ with its attractive Coulomb 
interaction –e2/rAB from its calculations. If this were really true, wave mechanics could never have 
made full advantage of the generic cusp condition deriving from the Coulomb scheme above. As 
a matter of fact, the cusp condition –1+2/D=0 applied to (9d) and (9e) would only generate a 
crossing point with the zero asymptote, without any further symmetry implication and, especially, 
without having to refer to the Coulomb symmetry for 2 asymptotes or 2 quantum states ±1 (see 
above). 
 

                                                 
3 It is easily verified that scaling with the eigenvalue WH= -e2/2a0 would invert the character of all interactions 
involved. Attractive would become repulsive, and repulsive attractive. Even with this odd assumption, the more 
essential two asymptote problem ±1 can never be never avoided.

D=2 Coulomb cusp for a hydrogen-antihydrogen transition in ab initio wave mechanics: 
analytical method 
 
The real problem is therefore to retrace exactly the nature of the wave mechanical cusp in Fig. 2 
for bound state (9a). In [1], we collected all repulsive and attractive terms in the Hamiltonian to 
arrive at a molecular Kratzer potential. We can now refine the same procedure more rigorously 
with all the terms and their values in (9a), obtained with the PW ab initio wave mechanical 
calculation. The true solution for the Coulomb cusp requires only three very elementary 
mathematical but physically very essential steps, which we could not yet retrace in the literature. 
(i) Let us first reposition WS in (9a) at the zero asymptote by adding -½WH, giving W0
S or 
 
(ii) Let us now scale like for (9d) and (9e). Since WH= -½e2/a0, scaling (10a) with |WH|=+½e2/a0 
gives a different result as in (9d). This is W’S=W0
W’S = -1 + 2/D + 2(J’ +K’)/(1+S) +1  

S/(+e2/2a0) or 
 
 

S = WS -½WH 

in which J’=J/(e2/2a0) and K’=K/(e2/2a0). Unlike (9a) and (9d), function (10b) starts from the 
zero asymptote at large D. For some strange reason to become clear below, we did not yet decide 
to replace +1-1 in (10b) by 0.  
(iii) For the last step, we refer to (5b), use the identity J’= -2/D + J’’ with J’’= +2e-2D(1+1/D), 
respect the sign of K and obtain instead of (9a) its mathematical equivalent

where we have managed to collect all repulsive terms belonging to asymptote or quantum state –1 
HH+ (subscript r) and all attractive terms for asymptote or quantum state +1 HH+ (subscript a). 
Square brackets give the terms corresponding with the classical Coulomb functions (–1+2/D)r 
and (1-2/D)a used for PECs (1f) in Fig. 1.  
We immediately verify that, leaving out the asymptotes +1 an –1, the two functions start off as 
±2/D, exactly as in Fig. 1 for the classical Coulomb recipe. 
This means that, like in (9d), the main and first repulsive term between square brackets is 
analytically exact the repulsive term in the asymptote directed Coulomb scheme in Fig. 1 for 
asymptote or quantum state –1, i.e. HH+. However, the new result is that the main attractive term 
between the second pair of square brackets, necessarily belonging to mutually exclusive Coulomb quantum 
state +1 or HH+, only differs through the appearance of factor 1/(1+S), which reduces to 1 for 
small S (at large D). For small S, this term is equal to +1-2/D as in (1f). Looking at the first 
principles involved, we cannot but conclude, analytically, that at long range, where the 
perturbation of atomic H or H by a proton sets in, the classical Coulomb approach (1f) with its 
inescapable antihydrogenic asymptote, is hardly discernable from the wave-mechanical approach (10c). 
As explained above, only in the more complex format (10c), taken directly from wave mechanics 
although it is hidden therein, it is possible to position a really generic Coulomb cusp at R=2a0 needed 
to explain the stability of the molecular hydrogen cation.  
The generic Coulomb cusp condition of Fig. 1 would have remained invisible if we had directly 
(be it correctly) simplified (9a) to analytical form (9c). But by rushing into (9c) by overlooking 
intermediary (10c) from which it derives, all essential information pointing towards Coulomb 
scheme Fig. 1, and in particular this important cusp formation mechanism would have been lost. 
Then, denying that this strictly wave mechanical scheme (10c) essentially derives from a 
seemingly naive Coulomb antisymmetry would be unfair. This negation, by hiding the first 
principles Coulomb model, would have led us indeed to the premature and unjust conclusion that 
only wave mechanics can cope with the essentials of chemical bonding. Failing to have seen this 
at an earlier stage with a simple exercise as done here and whereby the hydrogen-antihydrogen 
interaction must play a fundamental role, is exactly what led us the revisit the Heitler-London 
model for H2 [1].

Results and discussion 
 
The PEC resulting from (10c), identical with PW-relation (9a), is given in Fig. 5a for variable D 
and in Fig. 5b for 1/D. In this form, it can directly and quantitatively be confronted with the 
classical Coulomb scheme given in Fig. 1. 
We easily see in Fig. 5a that the repulsive contributions in the naïve Coulomb scheme and in the 
ab initio PW scheme are almost identical in the complete D-range. The attractive branch is 
slightly more distorted in order to produce the PEC given by (9c). These details are more visible 
in Fig. 5b. 
But the result is particularly interesting for the cusp formation mechanism. With a Coulomb 
scheme, this is almost trivial but would be mathematically impossible with the standard wave 
mechanical procedure if one would adhere only to end result (9c). The Coulomb cusp is, by definition, 
exactly at R=2a0=1,06 Å, the observed value [6], whereas the PW-result is much larger 1,32 Å [6].  
In Coulomb terms, this means that the PW-approach fails to respect the strict Coulomb cusp condition by wrongly 
estimating the deviations from pure Coulomb behavior, shown in Fig 5. And looking at (10c), it is easily 
verified that this error can, analytically, only reside in the wave functions used, as argued in [1]. 
The PW-result for the well depth for the bound state of the molecular hydrogen cation is 1,77 
eV, whereas experiment gives 2,78 eV [6]. Although we predicted the cusp correctly at a very 
early stage (see Fig. 1), we admit we cannot yet give an alternative classical solution for the well 
depth. Yet, we see that the analytical form of the final (9c) PW-solution is completely dependent 
on the analytical form of their wave functions (hydrogenic STOs) [5]. However, it can be 
anticipated with classical physics that, around the cusp, the simple Coulomb law will have to be 
adapted anyhow. In fact, in the neighborhood of the Coulomb cusp at D=2, it can be expected 
with classical physics indeed that the (circular) motion of the lepton will interfere with the Coulomb 
force. It is evident that kinetic energies are always repulsive and of type +b/r2 [1]. 
To quantify these classical views, we can easily give 2 phenomenological examples, inspired by 
the Kratzer and Morse potentials, since both potentials are also centered at the Coulomb cusp [7b], 
predicted by the matter-antimatter scheme in Fig. 1. 
Using the observed well depth of 2,78 eV [6], we looked for slowly varying cusp-respecting 
perturbing functions and found good behaving functions 0,15S[(1±2/D)2-1] ( exponentially attenuated 
Kratzer-type) and 4,5e-D(e-D±0,3) (exponential Morse-type). In each case, the + sign is correlated 
the repulsive or anti-bonding state (without cusp), the – sign with the bound or attractive state 
(with cusp), as prescribed in [1]. The 2 phenomenological PECs for bonding and anti-bonding states  
of Kratzer and Morse type are all depicted in Fig. 6, together with the PW functions (9a)-(9b) to 
accentuate the differences possible at the level of PEC construction.  
It is obvious from Fig. 6 that other asymmetries for or deviations from the original Coulomb law 
are, at least, possible and even plausible. We will not discuss here in full the differences between 
Morse and Kratzer functions, since this was done extensively elsewhere [7b]. In addition, wave 
mechanics is still confronted with the problem of the analytical differences between STOs and 
GTOs [5], which will greatly affect the final outcome of PW-functions like (9c). Also this 
problem cannot be discussed here in further detail [5].  
The analytical development for state WA runs completely parallel to that given for (10c). Only 
here, the attraction is greatly enhanced, even more than for state WS, but the enhancement for the 
repulsive terms turns out to be even greater, which makes this a repulsive state without extreme. 
These extremely interesting details on wave mechanical procedures, inspired by Coulomb 
behavior in Fig. 1, were never mentioned in the literature: this is why, conventionally, chemical 
bonding is still regarded as a one asymptote problem which can only be left with a repulsive force 
+e2/rAB. Our results prove why this restricted view must not be true after all. 
Moreover, looking for deviations of pure Coulomb behavior is not an exclusivity of wave 
mechanics. It is known for long from classical physics/chemistry that the original formulation of 
the Coulomb potential 1/R or force 1/R2 can be put in doubt, since a series with a number terms

like A/Rn is very well possible [7a], as is evident from the many molecular potentials proposed in 
the literature throughout the years [7] (see also the Kratzer function above). Realizing this, there 
is a great resemblance between classical physics and wave mechanics, typified by Fig. 1 and 5. 
Both are trying to find out more about deviations from Coulomb’s law. In classical physics, this is 
done by trial and error to find a universal molecular function or universal equation of state (UEOS) 
using spectral data and the PEC they generate [7]. In wave mechanics, this is done by trial and error 
by looking for the best wave functions possible using the same spectral data and the same PEC.  
It is now certain by all means that standard ab initio wave mechanics almost secretly but nevertheless 
formally and analytically admits the reality of and the need for the antihydrogenic HH+ asymptote as 
shown by the resemblance of Fig. 5 with Fig. 1. We easily verify that the wave mechanical 
solution tries to quantify the small deviations from pure Coulomb behavior with its 2 asymptotes 
as in Fig. 1, which is a conclusion never made before, to the best of my knowledge. This result 
makes it the more difficult to understand why the theoretical physics and chemistry establishment 
are so strongly opposed to bonding schemes using the crucial matter-antimatter asymptote, 
apparent from the first Hamiltonian symmetry in (1a), suggested in [1].  
Finally, the Coulomb interaction between charged species plays an important role only in the ionic 
approximation to chemical bonding [1]. Here, an anion interacts with a cation by means of Coulomb –
1/R attraction, which, in essence, is an annihilative charge-conjugated ion-anti-ion Coulomb interaction in 
the original Dirac sense [1].  
The confrontation of Fig. 5 with Fig. 1 leads to the same conclusion as Coulson’s [9] that ‘it has 
been laughingly said that quantum mechanics weighs the captain of a ship by weighing the ship when he is and is 
not on board’. In this terminology, the weight of the ship corresponds with the classical Coulomb anti-
symmetry scheme in Fig. 1. Its slight distortions, seemingly hidden in its wave mechanical version in 
Fig. 5, would correspond with the weight of the captain.  
 The zero asymptote approximation used in the complex apparatus of quantum chemistry as we 
know it today is devoted almost exclusively to the relatively small deviations in Fig. 5 from the original 
and generic Coulomb recipe in Fig. 1 with its matter-matter and matter-antimatter asymptotes and the transitions 
between them. Zooming in only on these otherwise interesting deviations of pure Coulomb 
behavior at large as in Fig. 5, fails to recognize the importance of the global Coulomb ±1/R 
scheme itself for chemical bonding. This is even more apparent when looking at the shape of the 
Coulomb PECs in Fig. 1 and at the pure Coulomb –1/R interaction, typical for centuries old ionic or ion-
anti-ion approximations to chemical bonding [1]. Exploiting consistently this strange similarity between 
pure ion-anti-ion and generic Coulomb PECs, leads straightforwardly to other approaches to 
chemical bonding [1,7a] with essentially the same atom-anti-atom asymptotes and interactions in 
(1f). Despite appearances, matter-antimatter asymptotes are used identically but secretly in the 
covalent HL wave mechanical approximation [1]. Ionic and covalent bonding models rely on the 
very same Coulomb symmetry principles (1f) and on the very same matter-matter and matter-
antimatter asymptotes or quantum states ±1, which is exactly as we argued in [1]. 
 
Conclusion 
 
We proved explicitly that generic algebraic Coulomb Hamiltonian (1a) is also a cornerstone for 
wave mechanical solutions for chemical bonding. Unfortunately, the underlying Coulomb recipe 
is hidden instead of made apparent in approximations like (9c) of Pauling and Wilson for the 
molecular hydrogen cation and, by extension, of Heitler and London for molecular hydrogen, 
exactly as we argued in [1]. Simple mathematics as in (10c) suffices to undo this unjust hiding of 
fundamental process with 2 Coulomb quantum states ±1 (1a), (1f) in wave mechanics. We also 
showed explicitly why, to understand wave mechanics from a classical point of view, it is indeed 
helpful to replace the value of the wave function throughout by +1 [1]. Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 reveal 
that classical and wave mechanical bonding schemes are very similar indeed, although wave 
mechanics merely focuses on details (distortions of the global scheme) rather than on the global

scheme itself. With the present ab initio analysis, it seems difficult to contest the reality of 
hydrogen-antihydrogen interactions even for explaining covalent bonding in molecular hydrogen 
[1]. With the results above, one should admit, sooner or later, that something very elementary 
went wrong indeed at a very early instance with antimatter and its interactions with matter [1].

The well-known simplest plasma model One-Component Plasma (OCP) is the system of free

moving charges of the same sign in the uniform compensating background of opposite sign. This 

model is studied carefully nowadays [1(cid:121)3]. It should be emphasized that this model is not the single

one  but  it  is  the  family  of  models,  in  fact.  The  difference  may  be  in  the  additional  short-range

interaction  and  in  the  type  of  statistics,  but  the  main  subject  for  the  following  discussion  is  the

difference in the nature and the thermodynamic role of background. 

In the ordinary version of the model OCP with the rigid background - the volume variations are

not  defined.  The  system  can  not  collapse  or  explode  spontaneously  and  so  the  well-known 

negativity [1] of formally defined pressure and compressibility does not signify the thermodynamic

instability.  The  only  phase  transition  –  crystallization  occurs  without  change  of  density  in  this 

version of OCP. 

Now  the  main  subject  of  our  interest  is  another  variant  of  this  model.  It  is  OCP  with  the 

compressible  but  still  uniform background.  It  means  that  the  background  does  not  screen  the

moving charges individually but does it in average only. More precisely, this version of model may

be defined by means of two variants of definitions:

A) Through the overall electroneutral Grand canonical ensemble [4] 

B)  Through  the  density  functional  with  the  strong  gradient  correction  at  the  Helmholtz  free
energy  of  background  so  that  this  term  would  tend  to  infinity  (A (cid:111) (cid:102))  after  the  thermodynamic
limit (N (cid:111) (cid:102), N/V = n = const)

(The contribution of Coulomb interaction is included in (1) into the "OCP"-term).

It is known that the crystallization occurs with the small density variation in this model [5]. But

the main statement of this report is the appearance of a new first-order phase transition [6], with the 

properties  strongly  depending  on  the  precise  definition  of  a  background  thermodynamic

contribution.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  existence  of  this  phase  transition  may  be  proved 

independently  of  a  calculation  of  phase  transition  parameters.  The  simple  arguments  [7]  with  the 

87

use of the Gibbs-Bogolubov inequality, dimensionless analysis and the well known lower bound for

the pressure correction of OCP [4] tend us to the form of equation of state of this model in the high

density limit (n (cid:314) (cid:146)).

Two conclusions may be done: 

1.  The  OCP  of  classical  point  charges  in  the  Boltzmann  ideal  gas  uniform  background  is 

thermodynamically unstable against a collapse at any temperature and density. This statement is in 

agreement,  firstly,  with  the  result  of  Lieb  and  Narnhofer  [4]  on  a  divergence  of  the  OCP  overall 

electroneutral  grand  canonical  ensemble,  and  secondly,  with  the  conclusion  of  Dyson  [8]  that 

thermodynamic stability of Coulomb system requires at least one sort of particles to be fermions.

2. In the case of ideal Fermi-gas background the phase transition of gas-liquid type with upper 

critical point appears at the sufficiently low temperature or sufficiently large value of charge. 

Classical Point Charges in the Ideal Fermi-Gas Background 

The equation of state of both these subsystems (OCP and background) are known almost 

exactly, so we can carry out direct calculations of the parameters of this phase transition. In this 

calculations we have used the analytical fits from [1, 5] (OCP) and [9, 10] (ideal Fermi-gas). The 

results are presented in Tab.I and Figs.1÷3 in standard notations.

remarked.

Some remarks should be done to these results: 

   1) The compressibility factor Zc (cid:123) {P/(ni + ne)kT}c in critical point has almost the same rather low 
value for all charge numbers (*).

   2) For Z > Z* (cid:167) 46 the melting curve (line (cid:42) = 178) crosses the gaseous part of binodal and thus it 
forms specific picture of the phase diagram.

3) The density variation between crystalline and fluid phases in the triple point is fairly small (see

Table  I)  when  this  point  does  not  coincide  with  the  critical  point,  in  this  latter  case  (Z = Z*)  the 

value  of  this  variation  increases remarkably.  Besides  that,  this  variation  is  much  greater  than  the 
value estimated in [5] ((cid:39)V/V (cid:167) 0.0003).

4)  For  present  phase  transition  the  deviation  from  the  well-known  semi-empirical  rule  of 

rectangular diameter is similar to those for alkali metals (Fig.2), but the slope of this diameter and a 

relation of normal to critical densities are rather great in comparison with the real substances. For
example, for alkali metals nc/n0 (cid:35) 4 - 5. 

   5) The critical point of this phase transition is not the genuine one because the density fluctuations 
in the vicinity of the critical point are absent in the model definition "A" and are suppressed by the 
gradient term in the definition "B". In the limit of the infinite gradient term the critical exponents 
must tend to their classical values. In the case of strong but finite gradient term in (1) the critical 
point position must slightly deviate from its limiting value.

6)  Remarkable  feature  of  any  non-uniformity  in 
equilibrium system of Coulomb particles (in particular 
of  inter-phase  boundary)  is  a  finite  difference  at  the
this  non-
average  electrostatic  potential 
uniformity.  The  equality  of  two  electrochemical
potentials for every kind of Coulomb particles at both 
sides  of  non-uniformity  leads  to  inter-phase  potential
drop depending on temperature (Fig.3)

The  zero-temperature  limit  of  this  drop,  (cid:39)(cid:77)0  is  the 
supplementary  thermo-electrophysical  constant  of  a
substance.  The high value of this drop for OCP model 

(see Fig.3) ought to be noted. Estimations for several metals [13] give the value e(cid:39)(cid:77)0/kT ~ 2-3.

Quantum Electron Gas

In this variant of OCP the moving charges are the electrons. When the background is rigid the 

melting curve changes its shape in the high density limit because of cold melting appearance. The 

estimations  [14]  give  the  Wigner  crystallization  inside  the  boundaries:  (cid:573) (cid:149) 178;  rs (cid:149) 67  [11]
(classical  and  quantum  melting)  and  T (cid:148) 10–5 Ry  [14].  Transition  to  the  electron  gas  in  the

compressible  but  uniform  background  changes  this  phase  diagram  essentially  because  of 

appearance of a vast phase transition of gas-liquid type. If we suppose that the parameters of this

phase transition for Quantum Electron Gas are close to those of Classical OCP on the ideal Fermi-

gas background, we should conclude that this new phase transition completely excludes the electron 

gas  Wigner  crystallization  because  of  its  melting  curve  placed  deeply  inside  not  only  two-phase

coexistence region, but just inside the spinodal curve (Fig.1). Therefore, at non-zero temperatures

this crystal is absolutely unstable against the phase decomposition into two fluid phases of weakly

coupled plasma: a dense phase and a rare one. For T (cid:124) 0 this supposition was declared previously in

[15].

Double OCP model. 

The background thermodynamic properties may be defined more meaningfully with the use of 

the variational principle of statistical mechanics. The choice of the N-particle distribution function 

in a multiplicative form as a product for nucleus and electron multipliers (cid:85)N = (cid:85)(+)(cid:152)(cid:85)((cid:16)) is equivalent 

to  the  complete  switching  off  individual  correlations  between  two  subsystems  of  charges  while

(+)(cid:316)(+) and ((cid:16))(cid:316)((cid:16)) correlations are completely permitted. So the nucleus and electrons turn for

each other into the uniform and compressible compensating background. This combination of two 

inserted  one  into  another  OCP-models  will  be  called  here  with  the  term  "Double  OCP".  By 

switching  off  other  kinds  of  dynamic  correlations  inside  each  sub-systems  one  can  obtain  the 

hierarchy  of  simplest  plasma  models  with  the  decreasing  free  energy.  Each  of  them  presents  the 

upper bound for a free energy of real plasma, the Double OCP being the best.

Being applied to the real substances, the Double OCP model gives the phase diagram depending on 

the masses of positive charges. For heavy particles the phase diagram is similar to those in Fig.1.

The  main  difference  is  additional  cold  melting  in  the  nuclear  subsystem  in  the  high  density  limit

(Fig.4). For the mass-symmetrical plasmas (electron-positron and electron-holes plasmas) the phase 

diagram  is  similar  to  this  for  electron  gas  with  the  only  phase  transition  of  gas-liquid  type.  The

91

Double OCP model gives a simple estimation for the critical temperature of this phase transition. 

For example in electron-positron plasma kTC (cid:124) 0.6 eV.

OCP Phase Transition and Anomalies in the Equilibrium Spatial Charge Distribution

The  discussed  OCP  phase  transition  seems  to  be  practically  unknown.  Let  us  consider  the 

situation where our knowledge of the properties of this phase transition may be useful. It is so in 

every case of a thermodynamically equilibrium spatial charge distribution in non-uniform plasma.

An example is the quantum electron distribution in atomic cell. This problem may be formulated in 

terms  of  the  Density  Functional  (for  example  [16]).  The  Free  Energy  Functional  F[n(W)]  is

minimized over the electron density n(r) with the additional normalization condition

When F(N,V,T) is the free energy of Boltzmann or Fermi ideal gas, we deal with the well-known

Poisson-Boltzmann or Thomas-Fermi approximations [16]. It ought to be emphasized that in frames 

of  approximation  (5)(6)  any  attempt  to  take  into  account  electron  correlations  by  using  the  exact 

expression for the free energy of electron gas, F(N,V,T) will require the equation of state of OCP 

with  the  uniformly  compressible  background.  As  a  result  the  discussed  OCP  phase  transition 

appears in the case of sufficiently low density and temperature (T < T*) in the form of discontinuity

in a spatial charge distribution inside the cell. So the smooth Thomas-Fermi (or Poisson-Boltzmann

92

in  classical  case)  distribution  will  be  subdivided  into  the  condensed  "drop"  around  the  attractive

center  and  diffuse  "atmosphere"  at  the  cell  periphery.  In  terms  of  the  OCP  phase  transition  the 

boundary  temperature  T*  is  just  equal  to  the  OCP  critical temperature  (for  electron  gas  it  is

Tc ~ 1 eV), and two values of local densities, n1* and n2* (see Fig.5) are equal to the densities of 

coexisting phases, condensed and gaseous, which are depending on temperature only. It ought to be

noted  especially  that  this  phase  decomposition  occurs  in  the  system  of  particles  with  entirely

repulsive interaction.

The curve under the main figure represents presently supposed profile of <Z> at low temperatures
0 < T < T(cid:619)

OCP ~ 1 eV. 

This  example  allows  one  to  predict  the  appearance  of  similar  phase  stratifications  in  all  the 

cases  when  the  equation  of  state  of  strongly  coupled  OCP  is  being  used  to  calculate  the  non-

uniform  charge  distribution  in  local  approximation (6).  For  example,  it  occurs  in  the  case  of 

equilibrium  charges  near  charged  hard  wall  or  in  the  case  of  the  background  edge,  the  same-sign

charges in macroscopic shell or cavity and etc. [7, 17].

It should be noted that it is not necessary to use in (6) the exact equation of state of strongly 

coupled OCP for the appearance of discussed discontinuity. For this it is sufficient to use any local 

attractive  correction  (exchange  or  correlation).  Therefore  this  discontinuity  must  appear  as  a

consequence  of  the  Thomas-Fermi-Dirac  approximations  or  other  local  modifications.  It  is  really

so,  just  the  same  discontinuities  were  shown  in  the  figures  (12÷15)  at  the  famous  book  of 

P. Gombash [18]. Note that the density of a "gaseous" part of the profile in the Fig.5 is equal to zero 

93

in the case T = 0. For the case T (cid:143) 0 the calculations of electron distribution in atomic cell in TFD-

approximation  have  been  made  in  [19].  The  degree  of  ionization  was  defined  in  [19]  to  be

proportional  to  the  boundary  electron  density.  One  can  conclude  this  quantity  should  be 
OCP ~ 1.0 eV. Unfortunately this part of results was omitted in the figures 1 
OCP  is  shown 

and  2  of  [19].  The  supposed  structure  of  omitted  part  of  this  curves  at  T  <  T(cid:619)

discontinuous for T < T(cid:619)

schematically under the Fig.6. It ought to be noted that the value of this discontinuity must increase 

when T (cid:314) 0 so that <Z*>1 (cid:314) 0 and <Z*>2 (cid:314) const (cid:167) 0.035 (this latter value corresponds to the

boundary electron density at rS (cid:124) 4.2 and P = 0).

Conclusions

Next models from OCP-family mentioned above (with the compressible but uniform background)

seem to be interesting for future study:

1. Double OCP plasmas (exact parameters calculation) 

2. Binary ionic mixture (BIM). Interrelation of presently studied phase transition with the well-

known phase decomposition in BIM-model [2,3].

3. Classical OCP of charged hard and soft spheres. 
4. Classical point charges (+background) with the repulsion ~ 1/rs (s (cid:148) 2), and Hard Spheres 

with the repulsion ~ 1/rs (s (cid:148) 3).

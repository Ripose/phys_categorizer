When a  high voltage (~30 kV) is applied to a capacitor whose electrodes have different physical dimen-
sions, the capacitor experiences a net force toward the smaller electrode (Biefeld-Brown effect).   We have 
verified this effect by building four capacitors of different shapes. The effect may have applications to 
vehicle propulsion and dielectric pumps.  We review the history of this effect briefly through the history of 
patents by Thomas Townsend Brown.  At present, the physical basis for the Biefeld-Brown effect is not 
understood.  The order of magnitude of the net force on the asymmetric capacitor is estimated assuming two 
different mechanisms of charge conduction between its electrodes:   ballistic ionic wind and ionic drift. The 
calculations indicate that ionic wind is at least three orders of magnitude too small to explain the magnitude 
of the observed force on the capacitor.  The ionic drift transport assumption leads to the correct order of 
magnitude for the force, however, it is difficult to see how ionic drift enters into the theory. Finally, we 
present a detailed thermodynamic treatment of the net force on an asymmetric capacitor.   In the future, to 
understand this effect, a detailed theoretical model must be constructed that takes into account plasma 
effects:  ionization of gas (or air)  in the high electric field region, charge transport, and resulting dynamic 
forces on the electrodes.  The next series of experiments should determine whether the effect occurs in 
vacuum, and a careful study should be carried out to determine the dependence of the observed force on gas 
pressure, gas species and applied voltage.

Introduction

Recently, there  is  a  great  deal  of  interest  in  the  Biefeld-Brown  effect:    when  a  high  voltage  (~30  kV)  is applied  to the
electrodes of an asymmetric capacitor, a net force is observed on the capacitor. By asymmetric, we mean that the physical
dimensions of the two electrodes are different, i.e., one electrode is large and the other small.  According to the classical
Biefeld-Brown effect (see Brown's original 1960, 1962, and 1965 patents cited in Appendix A, and a partial reproduction
below),  the  largest  force  on  the  capacitor  is  in  a  direction  from  the  negative  (larger)  electrode  toward  the  positive
(smaller) electrode.    Today,  there  are  numerous  demonstrations  of  this  effect  on  the  internet  in  devices  called "lifters",
which show that the force on the capacitor exceeds its weight
.  In fact, these experiments indicate that there is a force
on the capacitor independent of polarity of applied voltage.  In the future, the Biefeld-Brown effect may have application
to  aircraft  or  vehicle  propulsion,  with  no  moving  parts.    At  the  present  time, there  is  no  detailed theory to explain  this
effect, and hence the potential of this effect for applications is unknown.

In  Section  2  below,  we  describe  the  history  of  the  Biefeld-Brown  effect.    The  effect  of  a  net  force  on  an  asymmetric
capacitor is so surprising, that we carried out preliminary simple experiments at the Army Research Laboratory to verify
that the effect is real.  The results of these experiments are described in Section 3.  Section 4 contains  estimates of the
force  on  the  capacitor  for  the  case  of  ballistic  ionic  wind  and  drift  of  carriers  across  the  capacitor's  gap  between  elec-
trodes.  In Section 5, we present a detailed thermodynamic treatment of the force on an asymmetric capacitor, assuming
that a non-linear dielectric fluid fills the region between capacitor electrodes.  Section 6 is a summary and recommenda-
tion for future experimental and theoretical work. 

2.  Biefeld-Brown Effect

During the 1920's, Thomas Townsend Brown was experimenting with an X-ray tube known as a "Coolidge tube", which
was invented in 1913 by the American physical chemist William D. Coolidge [1].  Brown found that the Coolidge tube
exhibited a net force (a thrust) when it was turned on.   He believed that he had discovered a new principle of electromag-
netism and  gravity.  Brown  applied  for  a British patent  on  April  15,  1927,  which  was issued  on  November 15,  1928  as
patent  No.  300,311,  entitled,  "Method  of  Producing  Force  or  Motion".    The  patent  and  its  figures  clearly  describe
Brown's early work  on forces  on asymmetric capacitors, although  the electromagnetic concepts are mixed with gravita-
tional concepts:

The discovery of the Biefeld-Brown effect is generally credited to Thomas Townsend Brown.  However, it is also named
in  honor  of  Brown's  mentor,  Dr.  Paul  Alfred  Biefeld,  a  professor  of  physics  and  astronomy  at  Denison  University  in
Granville, Ohio, where Brown was a lab assistant in electronics in the Department of Physics. During the 1920's, Biefeld
and Brown  together experimented  on capacitors. 

In order to find a technical description of the Biefeld-Brown effect, I performed a search of the standard article literature,
and found no references to this effect.  It is prudent to ask whether this effect is real or rumor.   On the other hand, the
, see also Appendix A.
Internet is full of discussions and references to this effect, including citations of patents issued
In fact, patents seem to be the only official publications that describe this effect.

On July 3,1957, Brown filed another patent entitled "Electrokinetic Apparatus", and was issued a US Patent No. 2949550
on August 16, 1960.  The effect in this patent is described more lucidly than his previous patent No. 300,311, of Novem-
ber 15, 1928.   In this 1960 patent, entitled "Electrokinetic Apparatus", Brown makes no reference to gravitational effects: 

Figure 1:  Excerpt from Thomas Townsend Brown US Patent No. 2949550 entitled "Electrokinetic Apparatus",  issued a on August 16, 1960.

The claims, as well as the drawings in this patent clearly show that Brown had conceived that the force developed on an
asymmetrical capacitor could be used for vehicle propulsion. His drawings in this patent are strikingly similar to some of
the  capacitors  designs  on  the  Internet  today.    In  this  1960  patent,  entitled  "Electrokinetic  Apparatus",  Brown  gives  the
clearest explanation of the physics of the Biefeld-Brown effect. Brown makes several important statements, including:

† the greatest force on the capacitor is created when the small electrode is positive

† the effect occurs in a dielectric medium (air)

† the effect can be used for vehicle propulsion, or as a pump of dielectric fluid

† Brown's understanding of the effect, in terms of ionic motion

† the detailed physics of the effect is not understood

Below I reproduce Brown's first two figures and partial text explaining the effect:

Soon  after Brown's 1957 filing for  the above  patent, on May 12, 1958,   A.H.  Bahnson  Jr. filed for an improved patent
entitled "Electrical thrust producing device", which was granted a US Patent No. 2958790 on November 1, 1960.

On July 3, 1957, Brown filed another patent  (granted on Jan 23, 1962, as US patent No. 3018394) for an  "Electrokinetic
Transducer".  This patent deals with the inverse effect:   when a dielectric medium is made to move between high voltage
electrodes, there is a change in the voltage on the electrodes.  (This is reminiscent of Faraday's law of induction.)  Quot-
ing  from the 1962 patent by Thomas Townsend Brown:

Figure 4:  Excerpt from Thomas Townsend Brown US patent No. 3018394 entitled "Electrokinetic Transducer",  issued on January 23, 1962.

Until this time, the net force on an asymmetric capacitor was reported as occurring when the capacitor was in a dielectric
medium.  On May 9, 1958, Brown filed for another  patent (improving upon his previous work) entitled "Electrokinetic
Apparatus". The patent was issued on June 1, 1965 as Patent No. 3,187,206.  The significance of this new patent is that it
describes the existence of a net force on the asymmetric capacitor as occurring even in vacuum.  Brown states that, "The

6

AsymmetricCapacitorForce_v51_ARL-TR.nb

propelling force however is not reduced to zero when all environmental bodies are removed beyond the apparent effec-
tive range of the electric field".  Here is a quote from the patent:

Figure 5:  Excerpt from Thomas Townsend Brown Patent No. 3,187,206, entitled, "Electrokinetic Apparatus",  issued on June 1, 1965. 

In the above patent, Brown reports that the asymmetric capacitor does show a net force, even in vacuum.  However, at
present, there is little experimental evidence, except for two reports
, which do not explain the origin of the observed
force.   If the Biefeld-Brown effect is to be understood  on a firm basis, it is imperative to determine whether the effect
occurs in vacuum.    Enclosed in Appendix B, is my email correspondence with J. Naudin, where Naudin quotes from a
D
letter by Thomas Townsend Brown, who discusses the effect in vacuum.

The main question to be answered is:  what is the physical mechanism that is responsible for the net force on an asymmet-
ric capacitor?  The answer to this question may depend on whether the asymmetric capacitor is in a polarizable medium,
in air, or in vacuum.   However, to date the physical mechanism is unknown, and until it is understood, it will be impossi-
ble to determine its potential for practical applications.

3.  Preliminary Experiments at Army Research Laboratory

The Biefeld-Brown  effect is  reported  many places on the Internet, however,  it is not described in any physics journals.
Therefore,  we  decided  to  verify  that  the  effect  was  real.     C.  Fazi  (Army  Research  Laboratory(ARL))  and  T.  Bahder
(ARL) have fabricated  three simple asymmetric capacitors,  using the designs reported on the Internet
.   In all three
cases, we have verified that a net force is exerted on the capacitors when a high  D. C. voltage is applied to the electrodes.
The  three  asymmetric capacitors  that  we  tested  had  different  geometries,  but  they  all had  the  common feature  that  one
electrode was thin and the other very wide (asymmetric dimensions).    Also, a suspended wire, representing a capacitor
with the second electrode at infinity, showed lift.

Our  first  model  was  made  by  Tom  Bahder,  and  was    triangular  shape,  which  is  a  typical  construction  reported  on  the
Internet, see Figure 6.  One electrode is made from thin 38 gauge (0.005 mil) wire, and the other electrode is made from
ordinary  Aluminum  foil.    The  capacitor  is  approximately  20  cm  on  a  side,  the  foil  sides  are  20  cm  ×  4  cm,  and  the
distance of the top of the foil to the thin wire electrode is 3 cm. The foil and wire are supported by a Balsa wood frame,
so  that  the  whole  capacitor  is  very  light,  approximately  5  grams.    Initially,  we  made  the  Balsa  wood  frame  too  heavy
(capacitor weight about 7 grams), and later we cut away much of the frame to lighten the construction to about 5 grams.
We found that in order to demonstrate the lifting effect, the capacitor must be made of minimum weight. (Typical weights
reported on the internet for the design in Figure 6 are 2.3 grams to 4 grams.)

Figure  6:    Our  first  attempt  at  making  an  asymmetric  capacitor  (a  "lifter"),  according  to  the  specifications  given  by  J.  Naudin  on  Internet  web  site
http://jnaudin.free.fr/.

.

When about 37 kV was applied to the capacitor in Figure 6, the current was about 1.5 mA.  The capacitor lifted off its
resting surface.   However, this capacitor was not a vigorous flier, as reported by others on the Internet.  One problem that
occurred was arcing from the thin wire electrode to the foil. The thin wire electrode was too close to the foil.  We have
found  that  arcing  reduces  the  force  developed  on  the  capacitor.  Also,  compared  to  other  constructions,  ours  was  too
heavy, 5 grams.  We found  that a ground  plane beneath the capacitor is not essential for the lifting force to exceed the
capacitor's weight.

Consequently,  we decided to make a second version of an asymmetric capacitor, using a styrofoam lunch box and plastic
drinking  straws  from  the  ARL  cafeteria.    See  Figure  7.    The  capacitor  had  a  square  geometry  18  cm  ×  20  cm.    The
distance of  the thin wire (38 gauge)   to the foil was adjustable, and we found  that making a 6 cm gap resulted in little
arcing. When 30 kV was applied, the capacitor drew about 1.5 mA, and hovered vigorously above the floor.   

8

AsymmetricCapacitorForce_v51_ARL-TR.nb

Figure 7:  The second attempt at making a lighter asymmetric capacitor.

A question  occurred:   is  the toroidal (closed  circular) geometry of the capacitor electrodes essential to the lifting effect
that we have observed.   Consequently,  Tom Bahder made a flat-shaped, or wing-shaped,  capacitor as shown in Figure
8.  This  capacitor  was  made  from  two  (red)  plastic  coffee  stirrers  and  a  (clear)  plastic  drinking  straw  to  support  the
Aluminum foil.  The significance of  the clear  plastic straw was that  the foil could  be wrapped over  it, thereby avoiding
sharp foil edges that would lead to corona discharge or arcing.  The dimensions of the foil on this capacitor were 20 cm ×
4 cm, as shown in Figure 8.  The distance between the thin wire electrode (38 gauge wire) and edge of the foil was 6.3
cm.  This capacitor showed a net force on it when about 30 kV was applied, drawing about 500 mA.  The force on this
capacitor greatly exceeded its weight, so much so that it would vigorously fly into the air when the voltage was increased
from zero.   Therefore, we have concluded that the closed geometry of the electrodes is not a factor in the net force on an
asymmetric capacitor.    Furthermore,  the  force  on  the  capacitor  always  appeared  in  the  direction  toward  the  small elec-
trode--independent of the orientation of the capacitor with respect to the plane of the Earth's surface.  The significance of
this observation  is that  the force  has nothing  to do  with  the gravitational field of  the Earth,  and  nothing  to  do  with the
electric potential of the Earth's atmosphere.  (There are numerous claims on the Internet that asymmetric capacitors are
anti gravity devices, or devices that demonstrate that there is an interaction of gravity with electric phenomena, called.)  

Figure 8:  Flat shaped (or wing-shaped) asymmetric capacitor used to test whether closed electrode geometry is needed.

The  thin wire electrode must be at a sufficient distance away from the foil so that  arcing  does  not  occur  from the thin
wire electrode to the foil, at the operating voltage.  In fact, in our first model, shown in Figure 6,  the 3 cm gap from top
of the foil to thin wire electrode was not sufficiently large, and significant arcing occurred.   We have found that when
arcing occurs, there is little net force on the capacitor.  An essential part of the design of the capacitor is that the edges of
the  foil,  nearest to the thin wire,  must be  rounded  (over  the supporting  Balsa wood,  or  plastic straw,  frame) to prevent

AsymmetricCapacitorForce_v51_ARL-TR.nb

arcing  or  corona  discharge  at  sharp  foil  edges  (which  are  closest  to  the  thin  wire).    The  capacitor  in  Figure  6  showed
improved lift when rounded foil was put over the foil electrode closest to the thin wire, thereby smoothing-over the sharp
foil  edges.    Physically, this  means that  the  radius  of  curvature  of  the foil nearest to the small wire electrode was made
larger, creating a greater asymmetry in radii of curvature of the two electrodes.  

Figure 9: The capacitor consisting of a single wire. No bias applied.

When operated in air, the asymmetric capacitors exhibit a net force toward the smaller conductor, and in all three capaci-
tors,    we  found  that  this  force  is  independent  of  the  D.C.  voltage  polarity.    The  detailed  shape  of  the  capacitor  seems
immaterial, as long as there is a large asymmetry between the characteristic size of the two electrodes.    A suspended thin
wire (approximately 12 in length) also showed lift with about 37 kV and 1 mA current, see Figure 8.

When the asymmetric capacitors have an applied D. C. voltage,  and they are producing a net force in air, they all emit a
peculiar hissing sound with pitch varying with the applied voltage. This sound is similar to static on a television or radio
set when it is not tuned to a good channel.  We believe that this sound may be a clue to the mechanism responsible for the
net force.

Figure 10:  The wire capacitor showing displacement from the vertical. 35 kV applied.

The simplest capacitor configuration consists of a suspended thin wire from the hot electrode of the high voltage power
supply, as shown in Figure 9.  To observe the wire movement, a small piece of transparent tape was attached at the lower
end of the thin wire. From a vertical position, the wire lifted,  as shown in Figure 10 by as much as 30 degrees, once the
high voltage approached 35KV.  The usual air breakdown hissing sound of the other capacitors was heard when current
drain  reached  about  1mA.  Actually the  wire  did  not  remain suspended,  but  oscillated back  and  forth  approximately 60
degrees  from  vertical,  and  the  hissing  pitch  followed  the  oscillation  period  with  amplitude  and  frequency  changes.
Without the piece of tape at the end, the wire did not lift as much and the sound was considerably weaker. The piece of
tape seems to increase the capacitance and or the air ionization. This suspended wire configuration can be viewed also as
a  capacitor  surrounded  by  the  ground  system located  several  feet  away  (metallic benches,  floor  and  ceiling).  As  in  the
other capacitor experiments, it also did not exhibit a polarity dependence. 

4.  Previously Proposed Explanations for the Biefeld-Brown Force 

There are two proposed explanations for the Biefeld-Brown force. Both os these have been discussed on the Internet in
various places.  The first proposed scheme is that there exists an ionic wind in the high field region between the capacitor
electrodes,  and  that  this  ionic  wind  causes  the  electrodes  to  move  as  a  result  of  the  momentum  recoil.    This  scheme,
described in Section A below, leads to a force that is incorrect by at least three orders order of magnitude compared to
what is observed.  (This scheme also assumes ballistic transport of charges in the atmosphere between electrodes of the
capacitor, and it is is known that instead drift current exists.)  

In Section B below, we present the second scheme, which assumes that a drift current exists between the capacitor plates.
This  scheme  is  basically  a  scaling  argument,  and  not  a  detailed  treatment  of  the  force.    In  this  scheme,  the  order  of
magnitude of the force on an asymmetric capacitor is correct, however, this scheme is only a scaling theory. 

Finally, in Section 5 below, we present our thermodynamic treatment of the force on an asymmetric capacitor.

A.  Ionic Wind: Force too Small

The most common explanation for the net force on an asymmetric capacitor invokes ionic wind.  Under a high voltage D.
C.  bias,  ions  are  thought  to  be  accelerated  by  the  high  potential  difference  between  electrodes,  and  the  recoil  force  is
observed  on  an  asymmetric  capacitor.  A  simple  upper  limit  on  the  ion  wind  force  shows  that  the  ion  wind  effect  is  a
factor of at least three orders of magnitude too small.  Consider a capacitor that operates at voltage V.  Charged particles
of mass m, having charge q, such as electrons or (heavy) ions, are accelerated to a velocity v , having a kinetic energy 

The force exerted on an asymmetric capacitor is given by the rate of change of momentum

where I  is the current flowing through the capacitor gap, and I assume that all the ionic momentum, m v , is transferred to
the capacitor when the charged particles leave an electrode. Also, I assume that none of this momentum is captured at the
other electrode.  This is a gross over-estimation of the force due to ionic effects, so  Eq. (2) is an upper limit to the ionic
force.

Solving Eq.(1) for the velocity, and using it in Eq.(2) gives the upper limit on the force due to ionic wind

When the force F  is equal to the weight of an object, M g , where g  is the acceleration due to gravity, the force will lift a

If  I  assume  that  electrons  are  the  charged  particles  responsible  for  force  of  the  ionic  wind,  then  I  must  us  mass    m=

Another  possibility is that heavy ions (from the air or stripped off  the wire) are responsible for the ionic wind.  As the
heaviest ions around, assume that Cu  is being stripped from the wire. Using Cu for the ions, the mass of the ions is 63.55
m p ,  where 63.55 is the atomic mass of Cu and m p  is the mass of a proton.  The weight that could be lifted with Cu ionic
wind is then (upper limit):

Again, this value is three orders of magnitude too small to account for lifting a capacitor with a mass of  3 to 5 grams.
Therefore,  the  ionic  wind  contribution  is  too  small,  by  at  least  three  orders  of  magnitude,  to  account  for  the  observed

force on an asymmetric capacitor.

While the force of the ionic wind computed above is too small to explain the experiments in air, it should be noted that
this effect will operate in vacuum, and may contribute to the overall force on a capacitor. 

B.  The  Ion Drift Picture: Scaling Theory of Force

In the previous section, we computed an upper limit to the force on a capacitor due to ionic wind effects.  Ionic wind is a
ballistic flow of charges from one electrode to the other.  Clearly the force due to ionic wind is at least three orders of
magnitude  too  small  to  account  for  the  observed  force  on  an  asymmetric capacitor  (in  air).      There  is  another  type  of
classical  transport:    drift  of  charge  carriers  in  an  electric  field.    In  the  case  of  drift,  the  carriers  do  not  have  ballistic
trajectories,  instead  they  experience  collisions  on  their  paths  between  electrodes.  However,  due  to  the  presence  of  an
electric field, the carriers have a net motion toward the opposite electrode.  This type of transport picture is more accurate
(than ballistic ionic wind) for a capacitor whose gap contains air.  Drift transport is used by Evgenij Barsoukov  to explain
the net force on an asymmetric capacitor

The general picture of the physics is that the positive and negative electrodes of the capacitor are charged and that these
charges experience different forces, because the electric field surrounding  the capacitor is non-uniform.  See Figure 10.
The  electric  field  surrounding  the  capacitor  is  created  by  the  potential  applied  to  the  capacitor  electrodes  and  partial
ionization  of  air  into  positive  ions  and  electrons.    These  charge  carriers  experience  drift  and  diffusion  in  the  resulting
electric field.    The battery supplies the energy that is dissipated by transport of carriers in the electric field. The electric
field is particularly complicated because it is the result of a steady state: the  interplay between the dynamics of ionization
of  the  air  in  the  high-field  region  surrounding  the  electrodes,  and  charge  transport  (drift  and  diffusion  of  positive  and
negative carriers) in the resulting electric field.    

If the capacitor is surrounded by vacuum (rather than a dielectric, such as air), the net force F  on the asymmetric capaci-
tor can be computed by the sum of two surface integrals, one over the surface of the positive electrode and one over the
surface of the negative electrode[4]:

where  E  is  the  electric  field  due  to  charges  in  the  ionized  air  between  electrodes  (excluding  the  field  due  to  surface
charge  on the capacitor electrodes) and S+  and  S-  are the positive and negative electrode surfaces of  the capacitor. As
stated above, the complexity of the calculation is contained in computing the electric field E .    In Section 5, we give an
expression for the net force on the capacitor assuming that it is surronded by a dielectric, such as air.

{

An alternative but equivalent picture is that the capacitor is an electric dipole in an non-uniform electric field that it has
produced, and the ions form a molasses, due to their high mass and resulting low mobility. We will develop both pictures
below in scaling arguments.

Figure 11: Schematic diagram of the side view of electric field for the asymmetric capacitor in Figure 8. 

The electric field around the small wire electrode is much stronger than the field around the foil, see Figure 8 and 11.  In
our experiments, there is a big difference in the radii of curvature of the two capacitor electrodes:  the thin wire electrode
has  a  radius  r1 = 0.0025 inch,  and  the  edge  of  the  foil  has    a  radius  of  curvature  of  r2 = .125  inch.  This  difference  in
curvature leads to an electric field with a strong gradient.  The ratios of electric fields at the thin wire electrode to that at

the rounded edge of the foil is inversely proportional to the square of the radii of curvatures:  E1
However,  the  applied  voltage  is  on  the  order  of  30  kV,  over  a  gap  of  6  cm,  so  an  electric  field  of  magnitude

2500 µ 30 kV
ring due to the dielectric effects of charged air ions and electrons, as well as polarized air atoms.   When a positive high
voltage is applied to the asymmetric capacitor, ionization of  air atoms, such as Nitrogen, probably occurs first near the
thin  wire  electrode.    The  ionization  of  Nitrogen  atoms  leads  to  free  electrons  and  ions  near  the  small  electrode.    The
electron  mobility  is  significantly  larger  for  electrons  than  for  Nitrogen  ions.  This  can  be  expected  since  the  current
density J = s E = n e v where s = n e2 t
m  is the electrical conductivity,  n  is charge density, t  is the scattering time,
m.  Since electrons are three orders of magni-
and the mean drift velocity v = m E .  So the mobility behaves as m = e t
tude more massive than ions, it is expected that they are correspondingly more mobile.  Experimentally, it is found that
the electron mobility in air at atmospheric pressure and electric field E = 104 Volt

Therefore, the physical picture is that in the high field region the electrons, with their high mobility,  are swept out by the
electric field, toward the thin wire electrode and cause dynamic screening of the potential.  (Dielectric screening due to
polarized  air  atoms  will  also  take  place.)    However,  the  massive  (probably  positive)  ions  are  less  mobile  and  are  left
behind in a plasma surrounding the thin wire electrode.

A scaling argument can be made as follows.  The lower foil conductor feels a force F  of magnitude

where Q  is the charge on the foil electrode V  is the voltage between the capacitor conductors, and l  is the length of the
gap  between  thin  wire  electrode  and  foil.    The  charge  Q  and  voltage  V  are  quantities  that  are  actually  present  with
shielding taking place.   The negative charge on the foil, -Q, can be approximated in terms of the measured current, I
~1 mA, by saying that all the carriers are swept out in a time t : 

where t  is the time for carriers to move across the capacitor gap, l , if they are travelling at an average drift velocity, v.
Note  that  the  measured  current  is  due  to  the  electrons  .  Eliminating  the  charge  Q  from  Eq.  (10)  and  (11),  leads  to  an
expression for the net force on the capacitor

In Eq. (11), the current I  is a measured quantity, the voltage V  is on the order of 30 kV, and the drift velocity for elec-
trons is [5]

Alternatively, the electron drift velocity, ve , can be expressed  in  terms of  the mobility, me  given  in Eq.(8),  and electric
field, E .  The net force on the asymmetric capacitor is then given by

The  typical  asymmetric capacitor  has  a  mass  that  is  two  orders  or  magnitude  greater.    Consequently,  drift  of  electrons
cannot explain the observed force on the capacitor.

An  alternative to  using  the value  of  electron  mobility is  to  use  the  smaller value of  ionic mobility. (This  will lead to a
larger force because the force in Eq. (14) is inversely proportional to the mobility.)  It is not clear how this can be justi-
fied,  however,  the  numbers  come  out  closer  to  what  is  observed.  Using  the  mobility  of  nitrogen  ions  in  air,    given  in

The force on the capacitor, given in Eq. (18), is within a factor of 3, assuming a capacitor of mass 5 grams.  However, it
is difficult to see why the ion mobility is the appropriate quantity to use in the derivation of the force.

As alternative derivation of the scaling Eq. (14), consider the asymmetric capacitor as being essentially an electric dipole
of magnitude,  

p

= p = Q l

»

»

where  Q  is  the  charge  on  one  plate  and  l  is  the  average  effective  separation  between  plates.  When  a  high  voltage  is
applied to the asymmetric capacitor (assume positive voltage on the thin wire and negative on the foil),  the high electric
field  around  the  thin  wire  ionizes  the  atoms of  the  air.    There  is  comparatively little ionization  near  the  foil due  to the
lower  magnitude  electric  field  near  the  foil.    The  ionized  atoms  around  the  foil  form  a  plasma,  consisting  of  charged
electrons and positively charged ions.  The force on the capacitor must scale like 

where E is the electric field.  The gradient operates on the electric field, producing a magnitude d E
this value in Eq.(18), together with the size of the dipole, leads to a force on the capacitor

which is identical to Eq.(14).

From the scaling derivations presented above, it is clear that electron drift current leads to a force on the capacitor that is
too  small.      Using  the  value  of  mobility  appropriate  for  (nitrogen)  ions  leads  to  a  force  magnitude  in  agreement  with
experiment.  However, it is not clear why the mobility of the ions should be used in the calculation.

Note that the force, given by Eq. (14), scales inversely with the mobility m.  If the ions are responsible for providing the
required small mobility, then the picture is that the ions are like a low-mobility molasses, which provides a large space-
charge to attract the negatively charged foil electrode.  As soon as the foil electrode moves toward the positive ion cloud,
another positive ionic cloud is set up around the thin electrode, using the energy from the voltage source. In this way, the
dipole (asymmetric capacitor) moves in the non-uniform electric field that it has created.  Physically, this is  a compelling
picture, however, much work must be done (experimentally and theoretically)  to fill in important details to determine if
this picture has any merit.

5.  Thermodynamic Analysis of the Biefeld-Brown Force

In  this  section,  we  present  our  hypothesis  that  the  Biefeld-Brown  force,  generated  on  an  asymmetric capacitor,  can  be
described by the thermodynamics of a fluid dielectric in an external electric field produced by charged conductors.   The
(partially ionized) air between capacitor electrodes is the fluid dielectric. Although the air is partially ionized, we assume
that this fluid dielectric is close to neutral on the macroscopic scale.   The charged conductors are the asymmetric elec-
trodes of the capacitor.  The battery provides the charge on the electrodes and the energy sustain the electric field in the
air (dielectric) surrounding the capacitor electrodes.  

The total system is composed of three parts:  the partially ionized air dielectric, the metal electrodes of the capacitor and
the  battery (voltage  source),  and  the  electromagnetic field.    The  battery is  simply a large reservoir  of  charge.  The total
momentum (including the electromagnetic field) of this system must be constant [9]

Pdielectric + Pelectrodes + Pfield = constant

where Pdielectric  is the momentum of the fluid dielectric (air in the capacitor gap and surrounding region),  Pelectrodes  is the
momentum of  the metallic electrodes and  battery, and  Pfield  is the momentum of  the electromagnetic field.  Taking  the
time derivative of Eq. (22), the forces must sum to zero

As far as the electric field is concerned, its total momentum changes little during the operation of the capacitor, because
the  field  is  in  a  steady state;  energy  is  supplied  by  the battery  (charge  reservoir).  So  we  set  the  rate  of  change  of  field
momentum to zero, giving a relation between the force on the electrodes and the dielectric: 

A lengthy derivation based on thermodynamic arguments leads to an expression for the stress tensor, si k , for a dielectric
medium in an electric field [4,7,8]

isotropic,  but  nonlinear,  polarizable  medium,  due  to  the  high  electric  fields  between  plates.  Therefore,  we  take  the

where  we  have  dropped  the  term  containing  the  gradient  in  the  pressure,  assuming  that  it  is  negligible.  Equation  (33)

on the square of the electric field, which is in agreement with the fact that the observed force direction is independent of
the polarity of the applied bias.

There are four terms in the force.  The first term is proportional to the gradient of the dielectric constant, “¶.  We expect
that the dielectric constant has a large variation in between regions of low and high electric field, such as near the smaller
electrode. We expect that there is a strong nonlinear dielectric response due to ionization of the air.   The resulting free

charges can move large distances, leading to a highly nonlinear response at high electric fields. Therefore , it is possible
that this first term in the integrand in Eq. (33) has the dominate contribution.   We expect this term to contribute to a force
that  points  toward  the  smaller  electrode  (as  observed  experimentally),  and  we  expect  that  this  contribution  is  nearly
independent of polarity of applied bias (except for asymmetric plasma effects under change of polarity).

The second term in the force Eq. (33) is proportional to the gradient of the product of the square of the electric field and
the  difference  in  dielectric  constants.    The  difference  in  the  dielectric  constants,  eeff - ¶ ,  can  be  expanded  in  a  Taylor

The third term in the force Eq. (33) is difficult to evaluate. It may well be negligible, especially compared to the first term

For a linear medium, the first term in Eq. (35) contributes to a force pointing in a direction that is opposite to the gradient

force).  In order to obtain a net force from Eq. (35) that is oriented toward the smaller electrode, the second term in Eq.
(35) would have to dominate, i.e., the net force on the capacitor would be due to external charge effects.    The magnitude
of  the  external  charges  (from  battery  and  surrounding  air)  on  the  dielectric  fluid  is  unknown  and  must  be  determined

where the charge density rext  is a complicated quantity, due to emission of electrode material and free charges, such as
exists in a vacuum tube.    The magnitude and  sign  of  the force  cannot  be determined until a calculation is done  of the
charge density,  rext , and electric field, E .

The thermodynamic theory presented here provides a general expression in  Eq. (33) for the net force on a capacitor in
terms of the macroscopic electric field E.  This electric field in Eq. (33) must be determined by a microscopic calculation,
taking into account the ionization of gas between capacitor plates, and details of charge transport. 

In summary, at the present time, the relative magnitudes of the fours terms in the force expression given in Eq. (33) are
unknown. The magnitudes of these terms must be determined by constructing a set of experiments designed to determine
the field-dependent dielectric properties of the fluid  (given by ¶) surrounding the asymmetric capacitor electrodes. These
experiments will permit us to verify if the thermodynamic theory presented here can explain the magnitude and sign of
the observed force. 

6.  Summary and Suggested Future Work

We have presented a brief history of the Biefeld-Brown effect: a net force is observed on an asymmetric capacitor when a
high  voltage  bias  is  applied.      The  physical  mechanism responsible  for  this  effect  is  unknown.    In  section  4,  we  have
presented  estimates  of  the  force  on  the  capacitor  due  to  the  effect  of  an  ionic  wind  and  due  to  charge  drift  between
capacitor electrodes. The force due to ionic wind  is at least three orders of magnitude too small.  The force due to the
effect of charge drift is plausible, however, the estimates are only scaling estimates, not a microscopic model.  

In  Section  5,  we  have  presented  a  detailed thermodynamic theory  of  the  net  force  on  a capacitor that  is immersed in a
nonlinear dielectric fluid, such as air in a high electric field.   The main result for the net force on the capacitor is given in
Eq. (33). The thermodynamic theory requires knowledge of the dielectric properties of the gas surrounding the capacitor
plates.  It is not possible to estimate the various contributions to the force until we have detailed knowledge about
the high-field dielectric properties of the fluid.  

Much  more  experimental  and  theoretical  work  is  needed  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the  Biefeld-Brown  effect.  As
discussed above, the most pressing question is whether the Biefeld-Brown effect occurs in vacuum.  It seems that Brown
may have  tested the effect in vacuum,  but not reported  it, see Appendix  B.   More recently, there is some preliminary
work that tested the effect in vacuum, and claimed that there is some small effect--smaller than the force observed in air,
see the second report cited in Ref. [2].  Further work must be done to understand the effect in detail.

A set of experiments must be performed in vacuum,  and at various gas pressures, to determine the actual facts about the
effect.  A careful study must be made of the force as a function of applied voltage, gas species, and gas pressure.  In light
of the thermodynamic theory presented here, the dielectric properties of the gas used in the experiments must be carefully
measured.    Obtaining  such  data  will  be  a  big  step  toward  developing  a  theoretical  explanation  of  the  effect.    On  the
theoretical side, a microscopic model of the capacitor (for a given geometry) must be constructed, taking into account the
complex  physics  of  ionization  of  air  (or  other  gas)  in  the  presence  of  high  electric  fields.    Only  by  understanding  the
Biefeld-Brown effect in detail can its potential for applications be evaluated.

is due to ionic wind, but that there is another effect that would still operate in a vacuum.

Now Gravitec has a report on their website from Purdue University, Energy Conversion Lab

See:  http://foldedspace.com/EKP%20Ionic%20Wind%20Study%20-%20Purdue.doc

The purpose of the report is to explore the possibility that Electrokinetic Propulsion is just another manifesta-
tion of  the Ionic  Wind Effect. Three  different cases  were  explored; the first  being normal atmospheric  opera-
tion, in which the surrounding atmosphere was ionized. The second case used 
atmospheric ions present within a vacuum. The last case used the actual dielectric media as the ions.

Also the expected theoretical result in vacuum is off by a factor of more than a thousand (being a thrust of 3.65
e-4 mN expected, whereas a force of at least .31mN was observed at a lower voltage of 17kV). These were
the  only  observations  recorded,  since  it  was  deemed  unnecessary  to  try  to  take  readings  within  a  vacuum
since the observed and experimental currents are off by orders of magnitude and not enough to produce any
meaningful effect during Electrokinetic Propulsion experiments.

Gravitec admits the following:
The  initial  vacuum  test  showed  as  suspected  that  field  propulsion  did  not  require  any  exhaust  gasses  to
operate. These tests, while good, are not enough to bring to the scientific community, because something this
extraordinary  in  nature  needs  extraordinary  proof.  We  currently  need  to  perform  a  more  controlled  and
metered vacuum experiment to eliminate all doubts that have surrounded the phenomenon in the past.

It is our desire that the new vacuum test be done at one of the vacuum facilities at the Naval Research Labora-
tories (NRL ) in Washington DC, a NASA testing facility or in some other well equiped French labs sometime
in the near future. The test and the set ups will be created by Gravitec, in co-operation with the testing facility.
There will also be other participants including Dr. John Rusek and members of various interested government
agencies.

Dear ....,

You have  asked  several  question  which  I shall  try  to answer.The  experiments  in vacuum were conducted  at
"Societe Nationale de Construction Aeronautique" in Paris in 1955-56, in the Bahnson Laboratories, Winston-

22

AsymmetricCapacitorForce_v51_ARL-TR.nb

Salem,  North  Carolina  in  1957-58  and  at  the  "General  Electric  Space  Center"  at  King  of  Prussia,  Penna,  in
1959.

Laboratory  notes  were  made,  but  these  notes  were  never  published  and  are  not  availible  to  me  now.  The
results  were  varied,  depending  upon  the  purpose  of  the  experiment.  We  were  aware  that  the  thrust  on  the
electrode  structures  were  caused  largely  by  ambiant  ion  momentum  transfer  when  the  experiments  were
conducted in air. Many of the tests, therefore, were directed to the exploration of this component of the total
thrust.In the case of the G.E. test, cesium ions were seeded into the environment and the additional thrust due
to seeding was observed. 

In  the  Paris  test  miniature  saucer  type  airfoils  were  operated  in  a  vaccum  exceeding  10-6mm  Hg.Bursts  of
thrust  (towards  the  positive)  were  observed  every  time  there  was  a  vaccum  spark  within  the  large  bell  jar.-
These  vacuum sparks  represented  momentary ionization, principally  of the metal ions in the electrode mate-
rial. The DC potential used ranged from 70kV to 220kV.

Condensers  of  various  types,  air  dielectric  and  barium  titanate were  assembled on  a  rotary  support  to  elimi-
nate  the  electrostatic  effect  of  chamber  walls  and  observations  were  made  of  the  rate  of  rotation.Intense
acceleration was always observed during the vacuum spark (which, incidentally, illuminated the entire interior
of the vacuum chamber). Barium Titanate dielectrique always exceeded air dielectric in total thrust. The results
which  were  most  significant  from the  -standpoint  of  the  Biefeld-Brown  effect was  that  thrust  continued,  even
when  there  was  no  vacuum  spark,  causing  the rotor to accelerate  in the negative to positive direction to the
point  where  voltage  had  to  be  reduced  or  the  experiment  discontinued  because  of  the  danger  that  the  rotor
would fly apart.

In  short,  it  appears  there  is  strong  evidence  that  Biefeld-Brown  effect  does  exist  in  the  negative  to  positive
direction in a vacuum of at least 10-6 Torr. The residual thrust is several orders of magnitude larger than the
remaining  ambient  ionization  can  account  for.Going  further  in  your  letter  of  January  28th,  the  condenser
"Gravitor" as described in my British patent, only showed a loss of weight when vertically oriented so that the
negative-to-postive thrust was upward. In other words, the thrust tended to "lift" the gravitor. Maximum thrust
observed  in  1928  for  one  gravitor  weighing  approximately  10  kilograms  was  100  kilodynes  at  150kV  DC.
These gravitors were very heavy, many of them made with a molded dielectric of lead monoxide and beeswax
and encased in bakelite. None of these units ever "floated" in the air. 

There  were  two  methods  of  testing,  either  as  a  pendulum,  in  which  the  angle  of  rise  against  gravity  was
measured  and  charted  against  the  applied  voltage,  or,  as  a  rotor  4ft.  in  diameter,  on  which  four  "gravitors"
were mounted on the periphery. This 4 ft. wheel was tested in air and also under transformer oil.The total thust
or torque remained virtually the same in both instances, seeming to prove that aero-ionization was not wholly
responsible  for  the  thrust  observed.Voltage  used  on  the  experiments  under  oil  could  be  increased  to  about
300kV DC and the thrust appeared to be linear with voltage.

In subsequent years, from 1930 to 1955, critical experiments were performed at the Naval Research Labora-
tory, Washington, DC.; the Randall-Morgan Laboratory of Physics, University of Penna., Philadelphia; at a field
station  in Zanesvill,  Ohio, and  two  field stations  in Southern  California,  of the  torque  was measured  continu-
ously  day  and  night  for  many  years.  Large  magnitude  variations  were  consistenly  observed  under  carefully
controlled conditions of constant voltage, temperature, under oil, in magnetic and electrostatic shields, not only
underground  but  at  various  elevations.  These  variations,  recorded  automatically  on  tape,  were  statistically

processed and several significant facts were revealed.

There were pronounced correlations with mean solar time, sideral time and lunar hour angle. This seemed to
prove beyond a doubt that the thrust of "gravitors" varied with time in a way that related to solar and lunar tides
and  sideral  correlation  of  unknown  origin.  These  automatic  records,  acquired  in  so  many  different  locations
over  such  a  long  period  of  time,  appear  to  indicate  that  the  electrogravitic  coupling  is  subject  to  an  extra-
terrestrial  factor,  possibly  related  to  the  universal  gravitational  potential  or  some  other  (as  yet)  unidentified
cosmic  variable.In  response  to  additional  questions,  a  reply  of  T.T.  Brown,  dated  April,  1973,  stated  :"The
apparatus  which  lifted itself and floated in the air, which was  described by Mr Kitselman, was not a massive
dielectric  as  described  in  the  English  patent.Mr  Kitselman  witnessed  an  experiment  utilising  a  15"  circular,
dome-shaped aluminum electrode, wired and energized as in the attached sketch. When the high voltage was
applied, this device, althrough tethered by wires from the high voltage equipment, did rise in the air, lifting not
only its own weight but also a small balance weight which was attached to it on the uderside. It is true that this
apparatus would exert a force upward of 110% of its weight.

The above experiment was an improvement on the experiment performed in Paris in 1955 and 1956 on disc
air foils. The Paris experiments were the same as those shown to Admiral Radford in Pearl Harbor in 1950.

These  experiments  were  explained  by  scientific  community  as  due  entirely  to  "ion-momentum  transfer",  or
"electric wind". It was predicted categorically by many "would-be" authorities that such an apparatus would not
operate in vaccum. The Navy rejected the research proposal (for further research) for this reason. The experi-
ments  performed  in  Paris  several  years  later,  proved  that  ion  wind  was  not  entirely  responsible  for  the
observed motion and proved quite conclusively that the apparatus would indeed operate in high vacuum.

Later  these  effects  were  confirmed  in  a  laboratory  at  Winston-Salem,  N.C.,  especially  constructed  for  this
purpose. Again continuous force was observed when the ionization in the medium surrounding the apparatus
was virtually nil.In reviewing my letter of April 5th, I notice, in the drawing which I attached, that I specified the
power supply to be 50kV. Actually, I should have indicated that it was 50 to 250kV DC for the reason that the
experiments were conducted throughout that entire range. 

The  higher  the  voltage,  the  greater  was  the  force  observed.  It  appeared  that,  in  these  rough  tests,  that  the
increase in force was approximately linear with voltage. In vaccum the same test was carried on with a canopy
electrode approximately 6" in diameter, with substantial force being displayed at 150 kV DC. I have a short trip
of movie film showing this motion within the vacuum chamber as the potential is applied."

Kindest personal regards,

Sincerely,
T.Townsend Brown.>>

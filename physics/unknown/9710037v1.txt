Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to provide deﬁnitions for, and proofs of, the asymptotic
formulae given by Edmonds [1], which relate the 3j and 6j symbols to rotation
matrices.

The study of the asymptotics of the 6j symbol dates back to Racah [2], who
stated an asymptotic formula relating 6j symbols and Legendre polynomials. Ed-
monds [1] later generalized Racah’s formula by replacing the Legendre polynomial
by a rotation matrix. For a, b, c

Edmonds also gave a further result which related the 3j symbol to a rotation matrix.
For a, c

Edmonds did not give a proof of either result, nor did he deﬁne how the angular
momenta scaled or how the 3j and 6j symbols approached the rotation matrices.
Edmonds reasoned that, for suﬃciently large c, (4) could be replaced by

cos θ =

γ
c

.

Brussaard and Tolhoek [3], following a suggestion of Edmonds, argued heuristically,
that if a, c
b and θ is deﬁned by (5) then (3) holds. Brussaard and Tolhoek did
not deﬁne how a and c scaled, nor did they deﬁne how the 3j symbol approached
the rotation matrix.

Some years later, Ponzano and Regge [4] discussed the geometry of the asymp-
totics of the 3j and 6j symbols. To each asymptotic 6j symbol, Ponzano and Regge
associated a tetrahedron whose edges had length j + 1
2 , where j is an entry in the 6j
symbol, and to each asymptotic 3j symbol they associated a triangle whose edges
were labelled in the same manner. Thus, the tetrahedron associated to the above
6j symbol is that given in ﬁgure 1, from which

Hence there is a discrepancy between the geometrical aspect, given by Ponzano
and Regge, and the algebraic aspect, given by Edmonds, Brussaard and Tolhoek. If
j(j + 1) instead
we relabel the edges of the associated tetrahedron and triangle by
of j + 1
2 then φ and θ are deﬁned by (2) and (4) respectively. In [4], Ponzano and
Regge give an important asymptotic formula for the 6j symbol in which the associ-
ated tetrahedron is label as above. If we relabel the edges of the associated tetra-
j(j + 1) and apply the relevant modiﬁcations to Ponzano and Regge’s
hedron by
asymptotic formula, then this modiﬁed formula provides a worse approximation to
the 6j symbol than Ponzano and Regge’s original formula. This is discussed in the
ﬁrst part of section four. We deﬁne φ and θ by (6) and (7) respectively, rather than
by (2) and (4) for the following two reasons. The ﬁrst is that all the formulae are
simpler with these deﬁnitions and the second is that these deﬁnitions are consistent
with Ponzano and Regge which is important for the above reasons.

The purpose of this paper is to provide deﬁnitions for, and proofs of, the asymp-
totic formulae which relate the 3j symbol and rotation matrix of (3), and the 6j
symbol and rotation matrix of (1). In both cases, we deﬁne how the angular mo-
menta scale, and we also deﬁne how these particular 3j and 6j symbols approach
the rotation matrices of (3) and (1) respectively. These deﬁnitions make precise
a, c
. With these deﬁnitions, in section 2, we prove
(3), where θ is deﬁned by (7), and in section 3, we prove (1), where φ is deﬁned by
(6). In the ﬁrst part of section 4, we discuss why φ and θ are deﬁned by (6) and (7)
rather than by (2) and (4). In the last part of section 4, we discuss the relationship
between the results proved in sections 2 and 3. This entails using the result proved
in section 2 to arrive at an expression of a similar type to that proved in section 3.
The study of the asymptotics of 3j and 6j symbols is important in understanding
the Ponzano-Regge model of three dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity [4]. In
this approach, three dimensional spacetime is approximated by a simplicial manifold
formed by gluing together tetrahedra. To each edge of a tetrahedron in this simplicial
manifold Ponzano and Regge associate a half integer j, with the length of that edge
deﬁned as j + 1
2 , in such a way that the triangle inequality is satisﬁed on all the faces
of that tetrahedron. They then thus associate to each such labeled tetrahedron a 6j
symbol.

Any potential candidate for the quantum theory of gravity must reduce to gen-
eral relativity in some suitable limit. By allowing various combinations of the edges
in each tetrahedron in the simplicial manifold to become large, the Ponzano-Regge
model reduces to three dimensional general relativity without a cosmological con-
stant. Thus, to understand the relationship between the Ponzano-Regge model of
quantum gravity and general relativity the asymptotics of the 3j and 6j symbols
is important. The reduction of the above asymptotic 6j symbol to the rotation
matrix df
nm(θ) plays a crucial role in understanding the relationship between the
Ponzano-Regge model of three dimensional quantum gravity and the construction
of topological state sums from tensor categories [5].

Figure 3 [6] shows all the possible asymptotic limits of the 6j symbol. These
limits correspond to moving various combinations of the four vertices of the asso-
ciated tetrahedron. At the top of ﬁgure 3 is the unscaled 6j symbol in which the
four vertices remain ﬁxed. In the 1 + 3 case, one vertex is taken to inﬁnity while
the remaining three remain ﬁxed. This represents the reduction of a 6j symbol to
a 3j symbol [4].
In the 1 + 1 + 2 case, two of the vertices remain ﬁxed and the
remaining two move away from the ﬁxed vertices as well as away from each other.
This represents (1).

Following Edmonds [1], we ﬁrst deﬁne the 3j symbol and then the rotation matrix.

representation of rotations about a ﬁxed axis.

We have divided the discussion of the relationship between the 3j symbol and
the rotation matrix into two cases depending upon γ. We discuss the case where

As a and c tend to inﬁnity in the manner deﬁned above, it is important that
the range of summation in (10) remains ﬁnite. If this is not the case then the error
generated by the approximations used to reduce the 3j symbol to a rotation matrix
may not converge to zero. Brussaard and Tolhoek [4] did not discuss the eﬀect
the asymptotic limit had on the range of summation. The summation variable z is

III Rotation matrices and 6j symbols

Following Edmonds [1], we deﬁne the 6j symbol as follows. Let a, b, c, d, e and f
and
be non-negative half integers such that each of the triples
bdf
satisﬁes the triangle inequality and the sum of the entries in each triple is an

The scaling used in theorem 3 is clearly diﬀerent from that used in theorem 1.
The reason for this is that as λ tends to inﬁnity, φ is preserved, whereas, if we had
scaled a0, b0 and c0 as we did in theorem 1 then φ would not have been preserved.
Theorem 3 is non-trivial as df
nm (φ) does not converge to zero under this asymptotic
limit.

Proof. Changing the summation variable from z to t, where z = a+b+c+m+n+t,

As in the proof of theorem 1, the constraints on t ensure that as a, b and c tend
to inﬁnity in the manner deﬁned above, the range of summation remains ﬁnite so
that the error generated by applying various approximations to the factorials in
Φi, i = 1, 2, ..., 6, will converge to zero. By applying (11) to Φ1 and Φ2 and (12)
to the rest and following the arguments used in the proof of theorem 1 the result
follows. 2

IV Discussion

In the ﬁrst part of this section we discuss why φ and θ are deﬁned by (6) and (7)
rather than by (2) and (4). In the last part of this section we discuss the relationship
between theorems 1 and 3 which entails using theorem 1 to arrive at an expression
of a similar type to that in theorem 3.

9

p

In the introduction we noted that there was a discrepancy between the geomet-
rical and algebraic parts of the asymptotics of the 6j symbol. Edmonds deﬁned
φ and θ by (2) and (4) respectively, whereas the geometrical interpretation of the
asymptotics, given by Ponzano and Regge, leads to φ and θ being deﬁned by (6) and
(7). Of course, (2) is asymptotic to (6), and (4) is asymptotic to (7), because, if we
j(j + 1) into each of the terms in (2) and (4)
substitute the binomial expansion of
then (2) will converge to (6), and (4) will converge to (7), but, the geometry which
leads to φ and θ being deﬁned as in (2) and (4), when applied to a certain asymp-
totic formula, leads to a worse approximation to the 6j symbol.
In [4], Ponzano
and Regge give an asymptotic formula for the 6j symbol in which all the entries
all large. They label the edges of the tetrahedron associated to this asymptotic 6j
symbol by j + 1
2 where j is an entry in the 6j symbol. Suppose we now relabel the
j(j + 1) and apply the relevant modiﬁcations to
edges of the this tetrahedron by
the Ponzano-Regge asymptotic formula. Then as can be seen in the table below,
this modiﬁed asymptotic formula provides a worse approximation to the 6j symbol
than Ponzano and Regge’s original formula. Thus the labelling of the edges of the
associated tetrahedron by j + 1
2 is critical in the Ponzano-Regge asymptotic formula
and as (1) and (3) should give rise to an asymptotic formula of the Ponzano-Regge
type under some further asymptotic limit, we shall deﬁned φ and θ as in (6) and
(7). Also, by deﬁning φ and θ by (6) and (7), all the formulae are simpler, which
can be seen in the proofs of theorems 1 and 3.

Superﬁcially, theorems 1 and 3 appear to be similar as they both involve the
reduction of the primary object to a rotation matrix. It is thus natural to ask if
it is possible to arrive at an expression of a similar type to that in theorem 3 by
using theorem 1. This is indeed possible, but it is important to point out that the
asymptotic limit in this result will be the limit used in theorem 1 which is not the
same as the scaling used in theorem 3.

j(j + 1) has replaced j + 1

The following arguments are not intended to prove the link between theorems 1

and 3 but are to be regarded as a possible justiﬁcation for there being a link.

To discuss the existence of such a link we shall use two limits, both of which are
of the same type used in theorem 1. The ﬁrst limit reduces the relevant 6j symbol
to a 3j symbol [4], and the second limit when applied to this 3j symbol reduces it,
by theorem 1, to a rotation matrix. The overall result is an expression of the same
type as in theorem 3 but with a diﬀerent scaling of the nonnegative half integers.

In [4], Ponzano and Regge discuss how the 6j symbol

The geometrical interpretation of the above result is discussed by Ponzano and
Regge in [4]. As R
in the above 6j symbol, three of the vertices of the
associated tetrahedron remain ﬁxed and the remaining one moves further and further
away from the others. This causes the edges labelled by d, e and f to become parallel
to each other and it is these edges which deﬁne a z axis, with α, β and γ being the
projections of the edges labelled by a, b and c onto this axis (see ﬁgure 4). The
triangle associated to the above 3j symbol is the unscaled triangle in the associated
tetrahedron formed by the three ﬁxed vertices.

Now, replace a by b, b by b + m, c by f , d by a + n, e by a and f by c in (14)

ω1 = 2R + 1 and ξ = 2b + m + f + 2n + 2(c + R).

We now scale b by adding to it a real number R′ which is tending to inﬁnity.

This result is of the same type as Theorem 3 but with two scalings.

In the introduction we had ﬁgure 3 which represented the diﬀerent asymptotic
limits of the 6j symbol in terms of the tetrahedron associated to that 6j symbol.
The above result is represented by the arrow from 4 to 1 + 1 + 2 via 1 + 3. The
arrow from 4 to 1 + 3 is Ponzano and Regge’s reduction of a 6j symbol to a 3j
symbol in which one vertex of the associated tetrahedron is taken to inﬁnity while
the remaining three are ﬁxed, and the arrow from 1 + 3 to 1 + 1 + 2 is where one of
the three previously ﬁxed vertices is taken to inﬁnity. Hence the present paper has
completed the triangle with vertices 4, 1 + 3 and 1 + 1 + 2.

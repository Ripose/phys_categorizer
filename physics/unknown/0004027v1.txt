ABSTRACT

We  provide  a  quantum  derivation  of  Einstein’s  Weak  Equivalence  Principle  (WEP)  of  general
relativity  using  a  new  quantum  gravity  theory  proposed  by  the  authors  called  Electro-Magnetic
Quantum  Gravity  or  EMQG  (ref.  1).  EMQG  is  manifestly  compatible  with  Cellular  Automata  (CA)
theory (ref. 2 and 4), and is also based on a new theory of inertia (ref. 5) proposed by R.  Haisch, A.
Rueda, and H.  Puthoff (which we modified and called Quantum Inertia, QI). QI states that classical
Newtonian  Inertia  is  a  property  of  matter  due  to  the  strictly  local  electrical  force  interactions
contributed by each of the (electrically charged) elementary particles of the mass with the surrounding
(electrically charged) virtual particles (virtual  masseons) of the quantum vacuum. The sum of all the
tiny  electrical  forces  (photon  exchanges  with  the  vacuum  particles)  originating  in  each  charged
elementary particle of the accelerated mass is the source of the total inertial force  of  a  mass  which
opposes  accelerated  motion  in  Newton’s  law  ‘F  =  MA’.  The  well  known  paradoxes  that  arise  from
considerations of accelerated motion (Mach’s principle) are resolved, and Newton’s laws of motion are
now understood at the deeper quantum level.

We found that gravity also involves the same ‘inertial’  electromagnetic force component that exists in
inertial  mass.  We  propose  that  Einstein’s  general  relativistic  Weak  Equivalence  Principle  (WEP)
originates from common ‘lower level’  quantum vacuum processes occurring in both inertial mass and
gravitational  mass,  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  quantum  field  theory.  Gravitational  mass
results from the quantum activities of both the electrical force (photon exchanges) component and the
pure  gravitational  force  (graviton  exchanges)  component,  acting  simultaneously  on  the  elementary
particles  that  make  up  a  mass.  However,  inertial  mass  is  strictly  the  result  of  the  electrical  force
process only, as given by quantum inertia principle (with negligible graviton processes present).

Under gravitation, the elementary particles of a test mass near the earth exchanges gravitons with the
earth.  However  what  is  frequently  neglected  is  that  the  surrounding  (electrically  charged)  virtual
fermion  particles  also  exchange  gravitons  with  the  earth,  causing  the  virtual  fermion  particles  to
accelerate (fall) towards the earth. A test mass does move under the influence of these direct graviton
exchanges,  but  more  importantly,  moves  under  the  influence  of  the  falling  (electrically  charged)
virtual particles of the quantum vacuum, which dominates the total quantum force process. Therefore
a test mass under gravity ‘sees’  that the quantum vacuum accelerate in the same way as it did when the
test  mass  was  subjected  to  acceleration  alone.  Thus,  equivalence  arises  from  the  reversal  of  the
acceleration vectors of the quantum vacuum with respect to a test mass undergoing acceleration, as
compared to a test mass subjected to a gravitational field. In accelerated frames, it is  the  mass  that
accelerates.  Inside  gravitational  fields  it  is  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  that
accelerates.

A consequence of EMQG is that all elementary mass particles must consist of combinations of just one
fundamental matter particle type, which we call the ‘masseon’  particle. The masseon has one, fixed
(smallest) quanta of mass (similar to a quanta of electric charge), which we call ‘mass charge’. The
masseon  also  carries  either  a  positive  or  negative  quanta  of  electric  charge.  The  masseon  particle
generates a fixed flux of graviton exchange particles, with a flux rate being  completely unaffected by
high speed motion (like electric charge). The graviton is the vector boson exchange particle of the pure
gravitational  force  interaction.  The  physics  of  graviton  exchanges  is  nearly  identical  to  the  photon
exchanges of QED, with the same concept of positive and negative gravitational ‘mass charge’  carried
by masseons and anti-masseons respectively. The ratio of the strength of graviton to photon exchange
force  coupling  is  about  10-40  for  an  electron.  In  QED,  the  quantum  vacuum  consists  of  virtual
electrons,  virtual  anti-electrons,  and  virtual  photons.  In  EMQG,  the  quantum  vacuum  consists  of
virtual  masseons,  virtual  anti-masseons,  and  virtual  gravitons,  which  also  posses  both  positive  and
negative electrical charge and positive and negative ‘mass charge’. There are almost equal numbers of
virtual masseon and anti-masseon particles existing in the quantum vacuum everywhere, and at any
given time. This is why the cosmological constant is very close to zero.

 INTRODUCTION

“I have never been able to understand this principle (principle of equivalence) ... I suggest that it be
now buried with appropriate honors.”

- Synge:  Relativity- The General Theory

Imagine that you are stationary, and standing on the surface of the earth. Gravity feels like
a force that is holding your gravitational mass to the earth’s surface. Yet when you are
standing in a rocket undergoing accelerated motion (far from gravitational fields, moving
with an acceleration of 1 g), the principle of equivalence tells us that there is an identical
force exerted against the rocket floor by your inertial mass. However, this force is now
caused by your dynamic accelerated motion through empty space. While standing on the
earth,  however,  you  were  definitely  not  in  motion.  Why  should  there  be  such  a  deep
connection between what  appears to be two completely different physical phenomena: a
static force of gravity with no apparent motion, and a dynamic force due to the accelerated
motion of your mass? In other words, why should you weigh the same in the rocket as you
do on the earth?

The  principle  of  equivalence  encompasses  this  strange  ‘coincidence’,  and  is  one  of  the
founding postulates of general relativity theory. In it’s stronger form, it states that all the
laws of physics are the same in the above thought experiment. When stated in it’s weaker
form,  it  implies  that  objects  of  different  mass  fall  at  the  same  rate  of  acceleration  in  a
uniform gravity field, and that only laws of motion of physics are the same.

Equivalence also means that the inertial mass, i.e. the mass defined by Newton’s law of

  is exactly  equal  to  the  gravitational  mass,  which  is  mass  defined  by  a

motion:  m
i

F
i=
g

F r
g=
completely  different  law  given  by  Newton’s  universal  gravitational  law:  m
g
GM
(where mi and mg are the inertial and gravitational mass of an object, Fi  and  Fg  are  the
inertial and gravitational forces exerted on the object, g is the acceleration of the object, M
is the mass of the earth, r is the distance from earth’s center, and G is Newton’s universal
gravitational constant). Newton was well aware of this coincidence of mass equivalence,
which we refer to here as the Newtonian mass equivalence principle.

2

The  equivalence  principle  demands  that  that  mi  =  mg.  Why  should  this  be  true  in  our
universe?  It  has  been  about  85  years  since  the  discovery  of  the  Einstein  equivalence
principle,  and  hundreds  of  years  since  the  discovery  of  Newton’s  mass  equivalence
principle. Yet, it is still not understood why inertial mass exists in the first place, or why a
mass opposes acceleration with a back acting inertial force. More importantly, it is also
not  known  why  there  are  two  totally  different  physical  definitions  for  inertial  and
gravitational mass (instead of just one).

5

Furthermore,  masses  can  have  different  temperatures  (and  therefore  different  energy
content), and may be composed of different materials like lead, wood, water. Again, why
should mi = mg,, no matter what the material composition and the energy content that a
mass may contain? In short, the principle of equivalence is one of the deepest, unsolved
mysteries that exists in fundamental physics today!

Lacking  any  deeper  understanding  of  this  question,  most  physicists  prefer  to  accept
equivalence  as  the  fundamental  way  in  which  the  universe  operates.  Other  physicists
maintain  that  the  origin  of  the  principle  of  equivalence  is  one  of  the  deepest,  unsolved
mystery of modern physics, and deserves an explanation. In this paper we reveal for the
first time, the low-level quantum processes that are hidden from our view, and provide a
quantum field theoretic solution to the principle of equivalence. In other words, we show
how the principle of equivalence turns out to be purely a quantum process. Equivalence
results from the activities of quantum particles interacting with quantum particles, while
obeying  the  general  laws  of  quantum  field  theory.  This  paper  is  also  an  invitation  to
explore a new theory of gravity called ElectroMagnetic Quantum Gravity, or EMQG (ref.
1).  EMQG  is  based  on  a  new  understanding  of  both  inertia  and  the  principle  of
equivalence, which exists on the distance scales of quantum particles.

How is the Einstein principle of equivalence precisely defined? Physicists recognize two
main formulations of the principle of equivalence (with some minor variations): the Weak
Equivalence  Principle  (WEP),  and  the  Strong  Equivalence  Principle  (SEP).  The  strong
equivalence  principle  states  that  the  results  of  any  given  physical  experiment  will  be
precisely identical for an accelerated observer in free space as it is for a non-accelerated
observer  in  a  perfectly  uniform  gravitational  field.  This  is  the  form  of  the  equivalence
principle used by Einstein to formulate his theory of general relativity in 1915.

A weaker form of equivalence principle (WEP) restricts itself only to the laws of motion
of masses in these two situations. In other words, the weak principle of equivalence states
that only the laws of motion of a mass on the earth is identical to the laws of motion of the
same  mass  inside  an  accelerated  rocket  (at  1g).  Technically,  when  comparing  the
equivalence of a mass in a rocket to a mass on the earth, we assume that the motion is
restricted to short distances (mathematically, at a point) on the earth, where gravity does
not vary with height. The WEP implies that objects of different mass, different material
composition, and different energy content all fall at the same rate of acceleration towards
the earth (as they do in a rocket accelerating at 1g). How do we know that the WEP holds
true in general?

Newton was well aware that inertial mass was equivalent to gravitational mass (which we
call Newtonian equivalence). In fact even before Newton, there was an early experimental
demonstration  of  the  equivalence  principle  at  work.  This  historical  experiment  was
performed  by  Galileo  in  Pisa,  where  two  objects  of  significantly  different  mass  were
dropped off the leaning tower of Pisa. Galileo observed that the two masses arrived on the
ground roughly at the same time. The weak equivalence principle implies that these two
different  masses  should  fall  at  exactly  the  same  rate  (as  they  obviously  do  inside  an

6

accelerated  rocket).  Since  this  early  experiment,  the  equivalence  of  inertia  and
gravitational mass has been verified to a phenomenal accuracy of about one part in about
10-15 (ref 24). Einstein is generally credited with the elevation of the equivalence principle
to a fundamental symmetry of nature in 1915.

Conventional wisdom in physics assumes that the strong principle of equivalence is exact,
and somehow reflects a fundamental aspect of nature. It is assumed to be applicable under
any physical circumstance. It is believed to hold true at the elementary particle level, and
under enormously large gravitational fields such as on a neutron star. As a consequence,
Einstein’s  general  relativity  theory  (which  is  based  on  this  principle)  is  also  assumed  to
hold true under any physical condition. The principle of equivalence has been tested under
a wide variety of gravitational field strengths and distance scales. It has been tested with
different material types (ref. 6 and 7). It has been tested to an extremely high precision for
laboratory bodies (up to 3 parts in 10-12). It also has been checked to 1 part in 10-12 for the
acceleration of the moon and earth towards the sun. It has even been tested for individual
elementary particles, such as the neutron. To our knowledge, no confirmed violation of
the equivalence principle has been reported to date.

Yet after 80 years of close scrutiny, the principle of equivalence has still remained only a
postulate  of  general  relativity.  It  cannot  be  proven  from  more  fundamental  principles.
Some of the better literature on general relativity have drawn attention to this fact, and
admit  that  no  explanation  can  be  found  as  to;  “why  our  universe  has  a  deep  and
mysterious connection between acceleration and gravity”  (ref. 8). One must bear in mind
that mass is really nothing more than a vast collection of quantum particles, which interact
with each other through forces. Forces are also ultimately the result of quantum particles
called  bosons,  which  act  like  the  exchange  particles  that  transmit  momentum  from  one
particle to another. Therefore, it is essential that equivalence be understood at a quantum
particle level in order for a deeper understanding to emerge.

We  will  show  why  there  is  equivalence,  and  also  demonstrate  that  the  principle  of
equivalence  is  just  an  approximation,  albeit  an  extremely  close  approximation.  We  will
also  show  that  there  is  actually  a  tiny  imbalance  in  the  equivalence  of  inertial  and
gravitational mass, with the gravitational mass of an object being (every so slightly) larger
than the inertial mass. This effect is magnified when comparing the free fall times of very
large mass to that of an extremely tiny mass on the earth. Furthermore this effect may be
measured experimentally in the near future. We will also show that in certain extremely
rare physical circumstances, the equivalence principle does not hold at all (for example,
anti-matter; described in section 8)!

In  order  to  understand  the  equivalence  principle  (and  inertia)  on  the  quantum  level,  we
must  have  an  understanding  of  the  basic  concepts  of  a  new  theory  of  gravity  called
ElectroMagnetic  Quantum  Gravity  (EMQG,  ref.  1,  1998).  The  motivation  for  the
development  of  EMQG  was  the  consideration  that  the  universe  may  be  a  vast  Cellular
Automaton process (ref. 57). In the process of developing EMQG theory with this goal in
mind, we discovered the hidden quantum processes that are responsible for the principle of

7

equivalence. Before we can present our derivation of the equivalence principle, we must
first  briefly  review  the  important  concepts  of  EMQG  theory  that  are  required  to
understand the principle of equivalence. Reference 1 (1998) contains the entire work.

 INTRODUCTION TO ELECTROMAGNETIC QUANTUM GRAVITY

“The interpretation of geometry advocated here cannot be directly applied to submolecular spaces  …
it  might  turn  out  that  such  an  extrapolation  is  just  as  incorrect  as  an  extension  of  the  concept  of
temperature to particles of a solid of molecular dimensions”

A. Einstein (1921)

Two years ago we introduced a theory of gravity based solely on the activities of quantum
particles, which consist of quantum mass particles (fermions) and quantum force particles
(bosons). ElectroMagnetic Quantum Gravity (EMQG, ref. 1) grew out of an attempt to
understand  not  just  gravity  on  a  quantum  scale,  but  also  inertia  and  the  principle  of
equivalence. Various attempts at the unification of general relativity with quantum theory
have not been entirely successful in the past, because these theories do not grasp the true
quantum nature of inertia and the hidden quantum processes behind Einstein’s principle of
equivalence.  In  developing  a  theory  of  quantum  gravity,  one  might  ask  which  of  the
existing  approaches  is  more  relevant  or  fundamental;  quantum  field  theory  or  classical
general  relativity  (with  conventional  4D  space-time  continuum)?  Currently  it  seems  that
both theories are generally not compatible with each other.

EMQG is based on a postulate that the universe operates like some form of a vast Cellular
Automaton (CA) (ref. 2, 3, 4, 34, 57). Figure 21 shows a tentative model for the universal
CA. This led us to the position that quantum field theory is actually in closer touch to the
true  inner  workings  of  our  universe,  than  general  relativity.  This  is  because  many  CA’s
inherently    produce  stable,  oscillating  particle-like  patterns  that  are  reminiscent  of
elementary particles interacting. The CA requires strict locality, and therefore forces can
only  be  possible  through  the  exchange  of  ‘force  particles’.  On  the  other  hand  general
relativity  is  taken  as  a  global,  classical  description  of  space-time,  gravity  and  matter.
General relativity reveals the large-scale patterns and organizing principles that arise from
the hidden, local quantum processes existing on the quantum particle distance scales.

A  Cellular  Automaton  consists  of  a  huge  array  of  'cells'  or  memory  locations  that  are
capable of storing numerical data. The numeric state of all the cells, everywhere, changes
at  a  regular  synchronized  interval  called  a  ‘clock  cycle’.  The  change  in  numeric  state
depends on the numeric values of a cell’s neighbors and on the same set of fixed rules or
algorithm,  which  are  located  in  each  and  every  cell  of  the  cellular  automaton.  It  is
important to note that the ‘clock cycle’  marks events related to the CA operation, and is
not the same thing as events in our measure of time.

Unlike  the  ordinary  desktop  computer,  the  cellular  automata  computer  updates  all  it’s
memory  locations  in  a  single  ‘clock  cycle’,  thus  making  the  CA  computer  vastly  more
faster and powerful than any of the common computers systems in use today. It should be

8

noted that there already exists computational machines modeled on the CA architecture,
which  are  being  used  by  physicists  for  various  physical  modeling  projects.  These  CA
machines are used to model nature, such as problems in fluid flow and turbulence, rather
then for computing things like income tax or other business applications. However, it is
interesting to note how well the CA computer model is suited to modeling various particle
interactions,  such  as  for  elementary  particle  physics  problems,  fluid  mechanics,  and
turbulence problems. The CA structures used for these type of simulations are known as
‘Lattice Gases’.

The  cellular  automaton  computer  was  discovered  theoretically  by  Konrad  Zuse  and
Stanislav Ulam in the late 1940’s, and later was put to use by John von Neumann to model
the real world behavior of complex spatially extended structures. The best known example
of  a  CA  is  the  ‘game  of  life’  originated  by  John Horton  Conway  and  published  in  the
famous mathematical games department of Scientific American magazine in the 1970’s. A
direct  consequence  of  CA  theory  is  that  our  universe  must  be  utterly  simple  on  the
smallest scales. Furthermore, the universe must be completely deterministic, or at least be
deterministic in principle. The apparent randomness of nature set forth by quantum theory
must  reflect our general ignorance of the exact numeric state of a system on the CA. If we
know the structure of the universal CA, the exact mathematical rules that govern the cells
of the CA, and the exact numeric state of all the cells in the universe at a given instant,
then we have all the information needed to predict the exact future state of the system. Of
course this is completely impossible to do in practice, for a variety of reasons. Even if we
can somehow gather all this information, we would need a computer just as powerful as
the universal CA to process the data in a reasonable period of time!

We  believe  that  Quantum  Field  Theory  (QFT)  is  currently  our  best  mathematical
description of the inner fundamental workings of the universe. QFT tells us that all forces
originate  from  a  quantum  particle  exchange  process.  These  particle  exchanges  transfer
momentum  from  one  quantum  particle  to  another,  and  the  huge  numbers  of  particles
exchanged  produces  generates  what  appears  to  be  a  smooth  force  interaction.  The
exchange  process  is  universal,  and  applies  to  electromagnetic,  weak  and  strong  nuclear
forces, and also (as we hope to show here) for the gravitational force. The generic name
given to the force exchange particle is the ‘vector boson’  particle.

ElectroMagnetic Quantum Gravity (EMQG) is basically a quantum field theory model of
gravity. Figure 17 shows a block diagram of the relationship of EMQG with the rest of
physics.  Basically  EMQG  supports  the  view  that  gravity  is  based  on  particle  exchange
processes  in  accordance  with  the  general  principles  of  quantum  field  theory.  EMQG  is
based on the graviton (the exchange particle for the pure gravitational force), and also on
the photon (the exchange particle for electromagnetic force) exchange particles. What is
unique  about  EMQG  theory  is  that  gravitation  involves  both  the  photon  and  graviton
exchange  particles  operating  at  the  same  time,  where  now  the  photon  plays  a  very
important role in gravity! In fact, the photon exchange process dominates all gravitational
interactions and is, in most part, responsible for the principle of equivalence. The photon

9

particle  is  also  responsible  for  another  important  property  that  all  matter  possesses;
Newtonian inertia.

When  formulating  a  new  theory  of  quantum  gravity,  a  mechanism  must  be  found  that
produces  the  gravitational  force,  while  somehow  being  linked  to  the  principle  of
equivalence. In addition, this mechanism should naturally lead to 4D space-time curvature
and  should  be  compatible  with  the  principles  of  general  relativity  theory.  Nature  has
another  long-range  force  called  electromagnetism,  which  is  extremely  prominent  in  all
physical  interactions,  and  has  been  described  quite  successfully  by  the  principles  of
quantum field theory. This well-known theory is called Quantum ElectroDynamics (QED),
and  this  theory  has  been  tested  for  electromagnetic  phenomena  to  an  unprecedented
accuracy. Electromagnetism plays the essential role of atomic and molecular interactions,
and is responsible for most observable phenomena, including virtually all of chemistry and
biology.

Electromagnetic force is a long range force. Gravitational force is also a long range force.
Therefore  we  believe  that  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  gravitational  force  should,
somehow, result from a similar process as electromagnetism. The similarity between the
two  basic  forces  is  also  evident  from  classical  physics,  which  describe  the  Coulomb
electrical force and Newton’s law for the gravitational force. However a few obstacles lie
in the way for this line of reasoning.

First, gravitational force is observed to be always attractive, and never repulsive! In QED,
electrical  forces  can  be  both  attractive  or  repulsive.  One  result  of  this  is  that  there  are
equal numbers of positive and negative charged virtual particles in the quantum vacuum at
any given instant of time. This is because virtual particles are always created in equal and
opposite charged particle pairs, according to quantum field theory. Thus, there is a balance
of  attractive  and  repulsive  electrical  forces  in  the  quantum  vacuum,  and  the  quantum
vacuum is electrically neutral, overall. If this were not the case, the electrically charged
virtual charged particles of one charge type in the vacuum would dominate over all other
physical  interactions  involving  real  matter,  due  to  the  enormous  number  of  vacuum
particles involved.

Secondly,  QED  is  formulated  in  a  relativistic,  flat  4D  space-time  with  no  curvature.  In
QED,  electrical  charge  is  defined  as  the  fixed  rate  of  emission  of  photons  (strictly
speaking,  the  fixed  probability  of  emitting  a  photon)  from  a  given  charged  particle.
Electromagnetic forces are caused by the exchange of photons, which propagate between
the  charged  particles.  The  photons  transfer  momentum  from  the  source  charge  to  the
destination  charge,  and  travel  in  flat  4D  space-time  (assuming  no  gravity).  From  these
basic  considerations,  a  successful  theory  of  quantum  gravity  should  have  an  exchange
particle or graviton, which is emitted from a mass particle at a fixed rate as in QED. This
is  called  ‘mass  charge’,  and  is  analogous  to  electrical  charge  in  QED.  Therefore,  the
graviton  transfers  momentum  from  one  mass  to  another,  which  is  the  root  cause  of
gravitational force. Yet, the graviton exchanges must somehow produce disturbances of
the normally flat space and time, when originating from a very large mass.

10

Since mass is known to vary with velocity (special relativity), one might expect that ‘mass
charge’  of  a  particle  might  also  vary  with  velocity.  In  QED  the  electromagnetic  force
exchange process is governed by a fixed, universal constant (a ) which is not affected by
anything like motion (more will be said about this point later). Should this not be true for
graviton exchange process in quantum gravity as well? As we hinted, gravity is a long-
range  force,  governed  by  a  similar  mathematical  law  as  found  in  Coulomb’s  Electrical
Force  law.  Coulomb’s  Electric  Force  law  states:  F  =  KQ1Q2/R2  ,  and  Newton’s
Gravitational Force law: F=GM1M2/R2. Both are inverse square laws, both depend linearly
on the product of the two masses (or charges). Both obey the principle of superposition.

We  believe  that  this  suggests  that  there  is  a  deep  connection  between  gravity  and
electromagnetism.  Yet,  gravity  supposedly  has  no  counterpart  to  negative  electrical
charge.  Thus  might  leads  one  to  believe  that  there  is  no  such  thing  as  negative  ‘mass
charge’  for gravity. Furthermore, QED also has no analogous phenomena as the principle
of equivalence. Why should gravity be connected with the principle of equivalence, and
thus inertia, and yet no analogy of this phenomena exists for electromagnetic phenomena?

To  answer  the  question  of  negative  ‘mass  charge’,  EMQG  postulates  the  existence  of
negative ‘mass charge’  for gravity, in close analogy to electromagnetism. Furthermore, we
claim  that  this  property  of  matter  is  possessed  by  all  anti-particles  that  carry  mass.
Therefore anti-particles, which are opposite in electrical charge to ordinary particles, are
also  opposite  in  ‘mass  charge’.  In  fact,  negative  ‘mass  charge’  is  not  only  abundant  in
nature, it comprises nearly half of all the mass particles in the form of ‘virtual’  particles in
the universe! The other half exists as positive ‘mass charge’, also in the form of virtual
particles. Furthermore, all familiar ordinary (real) matter comprises only a tiny fraction of
the  total  ‘mass  charge’  in  the  universe,  and  is  experimentally  found  to  be  almost  all
positive! Real anti-matter seems to be very scarce in nature, and no search for it in the
cosmos has revealed any to date.

Both positive and negative ‘mass charge’  appear in huge numbers in the form of virtual
particles, which quickly pop in and out of existence in the quantum vacuum (section 3),
everywhere in empty space. We suggest that the existence of negative ‘mass charge’  is the
key to the solution to the famous problem of the cosmological constant (ref. 46), which is
one  of  the  great  unresolved  mysteries  of  modern  physics.  Finally,  we  propose  that  the
negative energy, or the antimatter solution of the famous Dirac equation of quantum field
theory is also the negative ‘mass charge’  solution for fermions.

Previous attempts at quantizing the gravitational field have been made using the principles
of quantum field theory. They focused on using the graviton force exchange particle alone,
which  is  proposed  as  the  quanta  of  the  gravitational  field  in  direct  analogy  with  the
quantization of electromagnetic fields with photons. The graviton particle is chosen with
the right mathematical characteristic to quantize gravity in accordance with quantum field
theory  and  general  relativity.  These  attempts  however,  fail  to  account  for  the  origin  of
space-time  curvature.  Specifically,  how  does  a  graviton  ‘produce’  curvature  when

11

propagating from one mass to another? Does the graviton move in an already existing 4D
space-time curvature? If it does, how is the space-time produced by the graviton? If not,
how is 4D space-time curvature produced? In other words, if the 4D space-time curvature
is not caused by the graviton exchanges, then what is the cause?

Furthermore, why do the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum not contribute a nearly
infinite  amount  of  curvature  to  the  whole  universe?  After  all,  the  force  of  gravity  is
universally attractive. According to quantum field theory, virtual gravitons should exist in
huge numbers in the quantum vacuum, and should therefore contribute huge amounts of
attractive  forces  and  a  large  amount  of  space-time  curvature.  This  infamous  question  is
known as the problem of the cosmological constant.

Does graviton exchange processes get affected by high velocity motion (with respect to
some  other  reference  frame)?  In  other  words,  do  the  number  of  gravitons  exchanged
increase  as  the  velocity  of  the  mass  increases,  as  seems  to  be  required  by  the  special
relativistic  mass  increase  with  velocity  formula?  Why  does  the  state  of  motion  of  an
observer near a gravitational field affect his local 4D space-time curvature? For example,
why does an observer in free fall near the earth affect his local space-time conditions in
such a way as to match an observer in far space (who lives in flat space-time)? EMQG
provides answers for many of these questions. Interested readers should refer to reference
1 (this is quite lengthy) for the answers to these and other questions to do with EMQG. In
the interest of being concise, this work presents only the important results from EMQG
that  are  needed  to  understand  the  principle  of  equivalence.  One  of  the  key  players  of
gravity  in  EQMG  is  the  quantum  vacuum.  Knowledge  of  this  important  medium  is
essential to the understanding of the principle of equivalence. Therefore we now briefly
review this subject.

THE QUANTUM VACUUM AND IT’S RELATIONSHIP EMQG

Philosophers:

“Nature abhors a vacuum.”

On  pondering  the  vacuum,  one  might  think  that  the  vacuum  is  completely  devoid  of
everything.  In  fact,  the  physical  vacuum  is  really  far  from  being  empty.  The  recipe  for
creating  a  complete  vacuum  is  to  remove  all  matter  from  an  enclosure.  However,  one
would find that this is still not good enough. One must also lower the temperature down
to  absolute  zero  in  order  to  remove  all  thermal  electromagnetic  radiation.  However,
Nernst correctly deduced in 1916 (ref. 32) that empty space is still not completely devoid
of all radiation after this is done. He predicted that the vacuum is still permanently filled
with  an  electromagnetic  field  propagating  at  the  speed  of  light,  called  the  zero-point
fluctuations (sometimes called vacuum fluctuations). This was later confirmed by the full
quantum field theory developed in the 1920’s and 30’s.  Later,  with  the  development  of
QED, it was realized that all quantum fields should contribute to the vacuum state, like
virtual electrons and positron particles, for example.

still not completely devoid of all radiation after this is done. He predicted that the vacuum
is still permanently filled with an electromagnetic field propagating at the speed of light,
called  the  zero-point  fluctuations  (or  sometimes  called  by  the  generic  name  ‘vacuum
fluctuations’).  This  result  was  later  confirmed  theoretically  by  the  newly  developed
quantum field theory that was developed in the 1920’s and 30’s.

Later with the development of QED (the quantum theory of electrons and photons), it was
realized  that  all  quantum  fields  should  contribute  to  the  vacuum  state.  This  means  that
virtual electrons and positron particles should not be excluded from consideration. These
particles possess mass and have multiples of half integer spin (such as the electron), and
therefore belong to the generic class of particles known as fermions. We refer to virtual
electrons and virtual anti-electrons (positron) particles as virtual fermions. We believe that
ultimately all fermions can be broken down to a fundamental entity that is also electrically
charged, as well as having half integer spin and mass.

According to modern quantum field theory, the perfect vacuum is teeming with activity as
all types of quantum virtual particles (and virtual bosons or the force carrying particles)
from the various quantum fields appear and disappear spontaneously. These particles are
called ‘virtual’  particles because they result from quantum processes that generally have
short  lifetimes,  and  are  mostly  undetectable.  One  way  to  look  at  the  existence  of  the
quantum  vacuum  is  to  consider  that  quantum  theory  forbids  the  complete  absence  of
propagating fields. This is in accordance with the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
In  general,  it  is  known  that  all  the  possible  real  particles  types  (for  example  electrons,
quarks, etc.) will also be present in the quantum vacuum in their virtual particle form.

In the QED vacuum, the quantum fermion vacuum is produced from the virtual particle
pair creation and annihilation processes that create enormous numbers of virtual electron
and virtual positron pairs. We also have in QED the creation of the zero-point-fluctuation
(ZPF)  of  the  vacuum  consisting  of  the  electromagnetic  field  or  virtual  photon  particles.
Indeed in the standard model, we also find in the vacuum every possible boson particle,
such as the gluons, gravitons, etc., and also every possible fermion particle, such as virtual
quarks, virtual neutrinos, etc.

Some estimates of the quantum vacuum particle density (ref. 11) maintain that the number
of  vacuum  particle  is  a  staggering  1090  particles  per  cubic  meter  of  empty  space!  The
densest places in the universe, for example neutron stars, contain nowhere near this many
particles. For comparison purposes, a neutron star contains about 1045 nucleons per cubic
meter, and therefore the quantum vacuum particles has on the order of 1045 times more
density  than  a  neutron  star!!  We  believe  that  the  quantum  vacuum  plays  a  much  more
prominent role in physics than is generally believed by most physicists. We maintain that

13

the  effects  of  the  quantum  vacuum  are  present  in  virtually  all  physical  activity.  In  fact,
Newton’s three laws of motion can be understood to originate directly from the effects of
the quantum vacuum (ref. 48).

One of the most important experimental evidence for the vacuum particles is the  Casimir
effect, which we discuss in detail.

3.1

INTRODUCTION TO THE CASIMIR FORCE EFFECT

The  existence  of  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  reveals  itself  in  the  famous
Casimir effect (ref. 49), which is an effect predicted theoretically by the Dutch scientist
Hendrik Casimir in 1948. The Casimir effect refers to the tiny attractive force that occurs
between two neutral metal plates suspended in a vacuum. He predicted theoretically that
the force ‘F’  per unit area ‘A’  for plate separation D is given by:

=

F
A

- p2
hc
4
D
240

 

…

Newton’s per square meter   (Casimir Force ‘F’)

    (3.1)

Casimir  obtained  this  formula  by  calculating  the  sum  of  the  quantum-mechanical  zero-
point energies of the normal modes of the electromagnetic field (virtual photons) between
two conductive plates.

The  origin  of  this  minute  force  can  be  traced  to  the  disruption  of  the  normal  quantum
vacuum virtual photon distribution between two nearby metallic plates as compared to the
vacuum  state  outside  the  plates.  Certain  virtual  photon  wavelengths  (and  therefore
energies)  are  forbidden  to  exist  between  the  plates,  because  these  waves  do  not  ‘fit’
between the two plates (which are both at a relative classical electrical potential of zero).
This creates a negative pressure due to the unequal energy distribution of virtual particles
inside the plates as compared to those outside the plate region. The pressure imbalance
can  be  visualized  as  causing  the  two  plates  to  be  drawn  together  by  radiation  pressure.
Note:  Even  in  the  vacuum  state,  the  virtual  photon  particles  do  carry  energy  and
momentum while they exist.

Although the Casimir effect has been attributed to the zero-point fluctuations (ZPF) in the
EM field inside the plates,  Schwinger showed in the late 70’s that the Casimir effect can
also be derived in terms of his source theory (ref. 50), which has no explicit reference to
the ZPF of the EM field between the plates. Recently Milonni and Shih have developed a
theory of the  Casimir force effect, which is totally within the framework of conventional
QED (ref. 51). Therefore it seems that it is only a matter of taste whether we attribute the
Casimir force effect to the ZPF fields or to the matter fields in vacuum (ref. 52).

Recently Lamoreaux made accurate experimental measurements for the first time of the
Casimir force existing between two gold-coated quartz surfaces that were spaced on the
order of a micrometer apart (ref. 53). Lamoreaux found a force value of about 1 billionth

14

of a Newton, agreeing with the Casimir theory to within an accuracy of about 5%. More
recently, U. Mohideen and A. Roy have made an even more precise measurement in the
0.1  to  0.9  micrometer  plate  spacing  to  an  accuracy  of  about    1%  (1998,  ref.  54).
Therefore the experimental reality of this effect is beyond question.

Can the vacuum state be disrupted by other physical processes besides the Casimir plates?
One  might  ask  what  happens  to  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  that  are
subjected  to  a  large  gravitational  field  like  the  earth?  Since  the  quantum  vacuum  is
composed of virtual fermions (as well as virtual bosons), the conclusion is inescapable: all
the  virtual  fermions  possessing  mass  must  be  falling  (accelerating)  on  the  average
towards  the  earth  during  their  very  brief  lifetimes.  This  vacuum  state  is  definitely
different from the vacuum of far outer space away from gravitational fields. Yet to our
knowledge, no previous authors have acknowledged the existence of this effect, or studied
the physical consequences that result from this. It turns out that the free fall state of the
virtual, electrically charged fermion particles of the vacuum is actually the root cause of
4D  space-time  curvature  and  also  leads  to  a  full  understanding  of  the  principle  of
equivalence. In EMQG we fully study the consequences of a falling quantum vacuum in
quantum gravity, which does lead to new experimentally testable predictions.

The  physics  of  the  Casimir  force  effect  implies  that  the  quantum  vacuum  contains  an
enormous  reservoir  of  energy  (ref.  11).  Although  in  standard  quantum  field  theory  the
number density of virtual particles is unlimited, some estimates place a high frequency cut-
off at the plank scale which is estimated to be a density of 1090 particles per cubic meter
(ref.  11)!  Generally  this  energy-density  is  not  available  because  the  energy-density  is
uniform and it permeates everything. It’s like the situation in the deep ocean, where deep
sea fishes easily tolerate the extreme pressures in the abyss, because the pressure inside
and outside the fish’s body balance. If a human goes into these depths, a great difference
in pressure must be maintained to support atmospheric pressure inside the human body.
Some physicists are looking at ways in which this vast energy reservoir can be tapped (ref.
11). Is there any other evidence for the existence of the quantum vacuum?

3.2

EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF VIRTUAL PARTICLES

Aside from the Casimir force effect, there is other evidence in theoretical and experimental
physics  for  the  existence  of  virtual  particles.  We  present  a  very  brief  review  of  some
theoretical  and  experimental  evidence  for  the  existence  of  the  virtual  particles  of  the
quantum vacuum. Some knowledgeable readers may wish to skip this section.

(1) The extreme precision in the theoretical calculations of the hyper-fine structure of the
energy levels of the hydrogen atom, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron
and muon are both based on the existence of virtual particles in the framework of QED.
These  effects  have  been  calculated  in  QED  to  a  very  high  precision  (approximately  10
decimal  places),  and  these  values  have  also  been  verified  experimentally  to  an
unprecedented accuracy. This indeed is a great achievement for QED, which is essentially

15

a  perturbation  theory  of  the  electromagnetic  quantum  vacuum.  Indeed,  this  is  one  of
physics greatest achievements.

(2) Recently, vacuum polarization (the polarization of electron-positron pairs near a real
electron particle) has been observed experimentally by a team of physicists led by David
Koltick.  Vacuum  polarization  causes  a  cloud  of  virtual  particles  to  form  around  the
electron in such a way as to produce an electron charge screening effect. This is because
virtual positrons tend to migrate towards the real electron, and the virtual electrons tend
to migrate away. A team of physicists fired high-energy particles at electrons, and found
that the effect of this cloud of virtual particles was reduced the closer a particle penetrated
towards the electron. They reported that the effect of the higher charge for the penetration
of the electron cloud with energetic 58 giga-electron volt particles was equivalent to a fine
structure constant of 1/129.6. This agreed well with their theoretical prediction of 128.5
of QED. This can be taken as verification of the vacuum polarization effect predicted by
QED, and further evidence for the existence of the quantum vacuum.

(3)  The  quantum  vacuum  explains  why  cooling  alone  will  never  freeze  liquid  helium.
Unless  pressure  is  applied,  vacuum  energy  fluctuations  prevent  its  atoms  from  getting
close enough to trigger solidification.

(4) For fluorescent strip lamps, the random energy fluctuations of the virtual particles of
the  quantum  vacuum  cause  the  atoms  of  mercury,  which  are  in  their  exited  state,  to
spontaneously  emit  photons  by  eventually  knocking  them  out  of  their  unstable  energy
orbital.  In  this  way,  spontaneous  emission  in  an  atom  can  be  viewed  as  being  directly
caused by the state of the surrounding quantum vacuum.

(5) In electronics, there is a limit as to how much a radio signal can be amplified. Random
noise signals are always added to the original signal. This is due to the presence of the
virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  as  the  real  radio  photons  from  the  transmitter
propagate in space. The vacuum fluctuations add a random noise pattern to the signal by
slightly modifying the energy of the propagating radio photons.

(6)  Recent  theoretical  and  experimental  work  done  in  the  field  of  Cavity  Quantum
Electrodynamics suggests that the orbital electron transition time for excited atoms can be
affected  by  the  state  of  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  immediately
surrounding  the  excited  atom  in  a  cavity,  where  the  size  of  the  cavity  modifies  the
spectrum of the virtual particles.

In the weight of all this evidence, only a few physicists doubt the existence of the virtual
particles of the quantum vacuum. Yet to us, it seems strange that the quantum vacuum
should  barely  reveal  it’s  presence  to  us,  and  that  we  only  know  about  it’s  existence
through  rather  obscure  physical  effects  like  the  Casimir  force  effect  and  Davies-Unruh
effect. This is especially odd considering that the real observable particles in our universe
constitute  a  minute  fraction  of  the  total  population  of  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum

16

vacuum  in  any  given  point  in  time  (even  when  considering  in  the  densest  places  in  the
universe).

We believe that the vacuum particle plays a much more prominent role in physics, and is
totally  responsible  for  Newtonian  Inertia.  Furthermore,  it  plays  a  major  role  in  the
principle  of  equivalence.  The  quantum  vacuum  mechanism  responsible  for  inertia  is  the
common  electrical  force  process  originating  from  photon  exchanges.  We  describe  this
process for inertia in more detail in the next section.

 INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM INERTIA THEORY

“Under  the  hypothesis  that  ordinary  matter  is  ultimately  made  of  subelementary  constitutive
primary  charged  entities  or  ‘partons’  bound  in  the  manner  of  traditional  elementary  Plank
oscillators,  it  is  shown  that  a  heretofore  uninvestigated  Lorentz  force  (specifically,  the  magnetic
component of the  Lorentz force) arises in any accelerated reference frame from the interaction of
the partons with the vacuum electromagnetic zero-point-field (ZPF).  ... The  Lorentz force, though
originating at the subelementary parton level,  appears to produce an opposition to the acceleration
of  material  objects  at  a  macroscopic  level  having  the  correct  characteristics  to  account  for  the
property of inertia.”

- B. Haisch, A. Rueda, H. E. Puthoff  (1994)

It has been recently proposed (1994) that Newtonian Inertia is strictly a quantum vacuum
phenomenon  (as  the  quote  above  suggests)!  If  this  is  true,  then  the  existence  of  the
quantum vacuum actually reveals it’s presence to us in all daily activities! Unlike the hard-
to-measure quantum vacuum effects such as the Casimir force, the presence of the inertial
force is universal and it’s presence prevails throughout all of physics. For example, when
you step on the gas pedal of your car you feel an inertial force pushing you against the
seat. If inertia is truly a quantum vacuum effect, then every time you are accelerating you
are witnessing the effects of the quantum vacuum! This is a far cry from the rather obscure
and exotic status that the quantum vacuum now holds in current physical thought.

In 1994 three physicists, R. Haisch, A. Rueda, and H. Puthoff (ref. 5), were the first to
propose  such  a  vacuum  theory  of  inertia  (known  here  as  HRP  Inertia),  in  which  the
quantum  vacuum  played  a  central  role  in  acceleration  and  inertial  mass.  They  proposed
that  inertia  is  due  to  the  strictly  local  electrical  force  interactions  of  charged  matter
particles  with  the  immediate  background  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  (in
particular the virtual photons, or ZPF as the authors called it). They found that inertia is
caused by the magnetic component of the Lorentz force, which arises between what the
author’s call the charged ‘parton’  particles  in  an  accelerated  reference  frame  interacting
with the background quantum vacuum virtual particles. The sum of all these tiny forces in
this process is the source of the resistance force opposing accelerated motion in Newton’s
F=MA. The ‘parton’  is a term that Richard Feynman  coined  for  the  constituents  of  the
nuclear particles such as the proton and neutron. Partons are now generally called quarks.

We have found it necessary to make a small modification to HRP Inertia theory as a result
of our investigation into the principle of equivalence. Our modified version of HRP inertia

17

is  called  “Quantum  Inertia”  (or  QI).  This  theory  also  resolves  the  long  outstanding
problems  and  paradoxes  of  accelerated  motion  introduced  by  Mach’s  principle,  by
suggesting that the vacuum particles themselves serve as Mach’s universal reference frame
(for  acceleration  only),  without  violating  the  principle  of  relativity  of  constant  velocity
motion.

In other words, our universe offers no observable reference frame to gauge inertial frames
(a non-accelerated frame, where Newton’s laws of inertia is valid), because the quantum
vacuum  offers  no  means  to  determine  absolute  constant  velocity  motion.  However  for
accelerated  motion,  the  quantum  vacuum  plays  a  very  important  role  by  offering  a
resistance to the acceleration of a mass, which results in an opposing inertial force. Thus,
the  very  existence  of  inertial  force  reveals  the  absolute  value  of  the  acceleration  with
respect to the net statistical average acceleration of the virtual particles of the quantum
vacuum.

In  the  past  there  have  been  various  clues  to  the  importance  of  the  state  of  the  virtual
particles of the quantum vacuum, with respect to the accelerated motion of real charged
particles. One example is the so-called  Davies-Unruh effect (ref. 15), where uniform and
linearly accelerated charged particles in the vacuum are immersed in a heat bath, with a
temperature proportional to acceleration (with the scale of the quantum heat effects being
very low). However, the work of reference 5 is the first place we have clearly seen the
identification of inertial forces as the direct consequence of the interactions of real matter
particles with the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum.

It has even been suggested that the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum are somehow
involved in gravitational interactions, a central concept of EMQG. The prominent Russian
physicist  A.  Sakharov  proposed  in  1968  (ref.  16)  that  Newtonian  gravity  could  be
interpreted as a van der Waals type of force induced by the electromagnetic fluctuations of
the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum.  Sakharov visualized ordinary neutral matter
as  a  collection  of  electromagnetically,  interacting  polarizable  particles  made  of  charged
point-mass subparticles (partons). He associated the Newtonian gravitational field with the
Van Der Waals force present in neutral matter, where the long-range radiation fields are
generated by the parton ‘Zitterbewegung’. Sakharov went on to develop what he called
the  ‘metric  elasticity’  concept,  where  space-time  is  somehow  identified  with  the
‘hydrodynamic elasticity’  of the vacuum. However, he did not understand the important
clues  offered  in  understanding  the  equivalence  principle,  nor  the  important  role  that  the
quantum vacuum plays in inertia and in Mach’s principle. We will see that the quantum
vacuum  also  make  it’s  presence  felt  in  a  very  important  way  in  all  gravitational
interactions.

After  Sakharov  there  has  been  further  hints  that  the  quantum  vacuum  is  involved  in
gravitational  physics.  In  1974  Hawkings  (ref.  17)  announced  that  black  holes  are  not
completely  black.  Black  holes  emit  an  outgoing  thermal  flux  of  radiation  due  to
gravitational  interactions  of  the  black  hole  with  the  virtual  particle  pairs  created  in  the
quantum vacuum near the event horizon. At first sight, the emission of thermal radiation

18

from a black hole seems paradoxical (since nothing can escape from the event horizon).
However,  the  spontaneous  creation  of  virtual  particle  and  anti-particle  pairs  in  the
quantum  vacuum  near  the  event  horizon  can  be  used  to  explain  this  effect  (ref.  18).
Heuristically, one can imagine that the virtual particle pairs (created with wavelength l
 are
approximately equal to the size of the black hole) ‘tunnel’  out of the event horizon. For a
virtual particle with a wavelength comparable to the size of the hole, strong tidal forces
operate  to  prevent  re-annihilation.  One  virtual  particle  escapes  to  infinity  with  positive
energy to contribute to the Hawking radiation, while the corresponding antiparticle enters
the black hole to be trapped forever by the deep gravitational potential. Thus, the quantum
vacuum is important in order to properly understand the Hawking radiation.

According to Quantum Inertia theory, the property which Newton called the inertial mass
of  an  object,  is  caused  by  the  vacuum  resistance  to  acceleration  of  all  the  individual,
electrically charged masseon particles (section 6) that make up the mass. This resistance
force is caused by the electromagnetic force interaction (where the details of this process
are  still  unknown  at  this  time)  occurring  between  the  electrically  charged  virtual
masseon/anti-masseon particle pairs created in the surrounding quantum vacuum (section
6.1), and all the real masseons particles making up the accelerated mass. Therefore inertia
originates in the photon exchanges with the electrically charged virtual  masseon particles
of the quantum vacuum. The total inertial force  Fi of a mass is simply the sum of all the
little forces fp contributed by each of the individual masseons, where the sum is: Fi = (S
 fp)
= MA (Newton’s law of inertia). Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of this process for a
mass accelerated by a rocket motor..

Any physicist that believes in the existence of the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum
and accepts the fact that many virtual particles carry mass (in the form of virtual fermions
such as virtual electrons and virtual quarks), will have no trouble in believing that virtual
fermion  particles  are  falling  in  the  presence  of  a  large  gravitational  mass  like  the  earth.
Figures  4  and  5  show  the  falling  state  of  the  quantum  vacuum,  and  it’s  effect  on  test
masses.  Yet  no  one  has  examined  the  full  ramifications  of  this  phenomena,  which  is
extremely important to EQMG theory.

We  believe  the  existence  of  the  downward  accelerating  virtual  particles  (which  are
accelerating during their very brief lifetimes) under the action of a large gravitational field
turns  out  to  be  the  missing  link  between  inertia  and  gravity.  It  leads  us  more  or  less
directly  towards  a  full  understanding  of  the  principle  of  equivalence.  Although  the
quantum  vacuum  has  been  studied  in  detail  in  the  past,  to  our  knowledge  no  one  has
examined  the  direct  consequences  of  a  quantum  vacuum  in  a  state  of  free-fall  near  the
earth. Before we continue studying these concepts, we present a rather brief review of the
important results from general relativity.

GENERAL RELATIVITY, ACCELERATION, GRAVITY AND CA

“The general laws of physics (and gravitation) are to be expressed by equations which hold good for
all systems of coordinates.”

- Albert Einstein

From  the  perspective  of  EMQG,  Einstein’s  gravitational  field  equations  are  a  set  of
observer  dependent  equations,  for  observers  that  are  subjected  to  gravity  and/or  to
acceleration.  These  equations  are  based  on  measurable  relativistic  4D  space-time.  The
core  of  Einstein’s  theory  is  the  principle  of  equivalence  and  the  principle  of  general
covariance, which allows an observer in any state of motion (and coordinate system) to
describe  gravity  and  acceleration.  We  very  briefly  review  these  basic  postulates,  and
important concepts of Einstein’s general theory of relativity.

POSTULATES OF GENERAL RELATIVITY

General  relativity  is  a  classical  field  theory  founded  on  all  the  postulates  and  results  of
special relativity. It is also based on Newtonian inertia and Newton’s laws of motion, as
well as on the following new postulates introduced by Einstein:

(1)  PRINCIPLE  OF  EQUIVALENCE  (STRONG)  -  The  results  of  any  given
physical  experiment  will  be  precisely  identical  for  an  accelerated  observer  in  free
space  as  it  is  for  a  non-accelerated  observer  in  a  perfectly  uniform  gravitational
field. A weaker form of this postulate states that: objects of different mass fall at the
same rate of acceleration in a uniform gravity field.

(2) PRINCIPLE OF COVARIANCE - The general laws of physics can be expressed
in a form that is independent of the choice of space-time coordinates and the state of
motion of an observer.

As  a  consequence  of  postulate  1,  the  inertial  mass  of  an  object  is  equivalent  to  it's
gravitational  mass.  Einstein  uses  this  principle  to  encompass  gravity  and  inertia  into  his
single framework of general relativity in the form of a metric theory of acceleration and
gravity, based on quasi-Riemann geometry (where time also enters as a coordinate, unlike
pure Riemann geometry).

These postulates, and the additional assumption that when gravitational fields are present
nearby, space-time takes the form of a quasi-Riemannian manifold endowed with a metric
curvature of the form ds2 = gik dxi dxj, led Einstein to discover his famous gravitational
field equations given below:

where, gik is the metric tensor, Rik is the covariant Riemann curvature tensor. The left-hand
side of the above equation is called the Einstein tensor or  Gik, which is the mathematical
statement  of  space-time  curvature  that  is  reference  frame  independent,  and  generally
covariant. The right hand side  Tik  is  the  stress-energy  tensor  which  is  the  mathematical
statement  of  the  special  relativistic  treatment  of  mass-energy  density,  G  is  Newton’s
gravitational constant, and c the velocity of light.

Einstein’s law of gravitation (eq 5.1) cannot be derived from any ‘rigorous’  proof.  The
famous physicist S. Chandrasekhar writes in regards to this (ref 37):

“... It seems to this writer that in fact no such derivation exists and that, at the present
time, no such can be given.  ... It is the object of this paper to show how a mixture of
physical  reasonableness,  mathematical  simplicity,  and  aesthetic  sensibility  lead  one,
more or less uniquely, to Einstein’s field equations.”

In Einstein’s  field  equation  (eq.  5.1)  the  principle  of  equivalence  (in  its  strong  form)  is
incorporated in the above framework by the assertion that all accelerations are caused by
either gravitational or inertial forces, and are metrical in nature. In other words, the space-
time is equivalent in inertial frame of a rocket at 1g and gravitational field on the earth (in
a small vicinity). More precisely, the presence of acceleration caused by either an inertial
force or a gravitational field modifies the geometry of space-time such that it is a quasi-
Riemannian manifold endowed with a metric.

Furthermore, point particles move in gravitational fields along geodesic paths governed by
the equation:

The most striking consequence of general relativity is the existence of curved 4D space-
time specified by the metric tensor gik. We will see that in EMQG theory, the meaning of
the  geodesic  is  very  simple;  it  is  the  path  taken  by  light  or  (force  free)  point  particles
through  the  falling,  electrically  charged,  virtual  particles  undergoing  acceleration  in  the
absence of any other external forces, that maintains a relative, average acceleration of zero
with the vacuum particles. In other words for light traveling through the falling quantum
vacuum, the photons frequently scatter with the electrically charged virtual particles of the
quantum vacuum causing a deflected path. We will see that curvature can be completely
understood at the particle level, as a pure vacuum-particle process. Furthermore, we will
see  that  the  principle  of  equivalence  is  a  pure  particle  interaction  process,  and  not  a
fundamental  law  of  nature.  Before  we  can  show  this,  we  must  carefully  review  the
principle of equivalence from the context of general relativity theory.

INTRODUCTION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUIVALENCE

“I have never been able to understand this principle (principle of equivalence) ... I suggest that it be
now buried with appropriate honors.”

- Synge:  Relativity- The General Theory

Again  we  would  like  to  emphasize  that  Einstein  did  not  explain  the  origin  of  inertia  in
general relativity. Instead he retained the classical Newtonian theory of inertia. Inertia is
described by Newton in his famous law: F=MA; which states that an object resists being
accelerated by a force (F). In other words, a force is required to accelerate an object of
mass (M) to an acceleration (A) in order to overcome the inertial back-acting force. Since
acceleration is a form of motion, it would seem that a reference frame is required in order
to gauge this motion. But this is not the case in Newtonian physics. All observers agree as
to  which  frame  is  actually  accelerating  (without  observing  the  actual  motions  of  other
observers),  by  finding  out  which  frames  has  a  force  associated  with  it.  Only  non-
accelerated frames are relative.

If  the  observers  are  placed  in  three  rockets  with  no  windows  available,  and  only  one
observer has the rocket motor running, it is easy for each of the observer to determine if it
is their rocket engine that is turned on. The observer simply looks for the presence of a
force  on  his  body.  Two  observers  will  feel  no  forces,  and  the  third  will.  However,  the
observers  who’s  rocket  engine  is  turned  on  might  conclude  that  one  of  the  observers
who’s  rocket  engine  is  turned  he  is  accelerating  by  measure  x  and  t  through  relative
measurements of space and time.

So constant velocities are always relative. Accelerations may be absolute (because we do
not  need  to  know  x  or  t  to  determine  a=d2x/dt2,  and  can  determine  acceleration  by
measuring  F  and  m,  where  a=F/m),  or  acceleration  may  be  relative  (if  we  decide  to
measure a by direct determination of x and t) in special relativity. To us this seems very
paradoxical. Einstein did not solve this anomaly (which relates to Mach’s principle), nor
did he provide a reason why the inertial and gravitation masses of an object are equal. This
also  still  remains  as  a  postulate  in  his  theory.    It  is  widely  known  that  the  principle  of
equivalence has been tested to great accuracy. The equivalence of inertia and gravitational
mass has been verified to an accuracy of one part in about 10-15 (ref 24).

Einstein's  general  theory  of  relativity  is  considered  a  "classical"  theory,  because  matter,
space,  and  time  are  treated  as  continuous  classical  variables.  It  is  known  however,  that
matter is made of discrete particles, and that forces are caused by particle exchanges as
described by quantum field theory. A more complete theory of gravity should encompass a
detailed  quantum  process  for  gravity  involving  particle  interactions  only.  In  the  next
section  we  introduce  another  important  player  in  EMQG,  the  masseon  particle.  This
particle is required in order to understand the principle of equivalence. The masseon turns
out to be the fundamental particle that makes up all fermions.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE GRAVITON AND THE MASSEON

The theory that best describes the quantization of the electromagnetic force field is called
Quantum  Electrodynamics  (QED).  Here  the  charged  particles  (electrons,  positrons)  act
upon each other through the exchange of force particles, which are called photons. The
photons  represent  the  quantization  of  the  classical  electromagnetic  field.  In  classical
electromagnetic theory, the force due to two charged particles decreases with the inverse
square of their separation distance (Coulomb’s inverse square law: F = kq1q2/r2, where k is
a constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance of separation).

QED accounts for this inverse square law by postulating the exchange of photons between
the charged particles. The number of photons emitted and absorbed by a given charge (per
unit of time) is fixed and is called the charge of the particle. Thus, if the charge doubles,
the  force  doubles  because  twice  as  many  photons  are  exchanged  during  the  force
interaction. This force interaction process causes the affected particles to accelerate either
towards  or  away  from  each  other  depending  on  if  the  charge  is  positive  or  negative
(because  positive  and  negative  charges  transmit  photons  with  slightly  different  wave
functions that induce attraction or repulsive accelerations).

The strength of the electromagnetic force varies as the inverse square of the distance of
separation  between  the  charges  in  the  following  way:  each  charge  sends  and  receives
photons  from  every  direction.  But,  the  number  of  photons  per  unit  area,  emitted  or
received, decreases by the factor 1/4p r2 (the surface area of a sphere) at a distance ‘r’  due
to the photon emission pattern spreading in all directions. Thus, if the distance doubles,
the number of photons exchanged decreases by a factor of four.

Imagine that an electron particle is at the center of a sphere sending out virtual photons in
all directions. Imagine that another electron is on the surface of a sphere at a distance ‘r’
from the emitter, which absorbs some of these photons. The absorption of these photons
causes an outward acceleration, and thus a repulsive force. If the charge is doubled on the
central electron, there is twice as many photons appearing at the surface of the sphere, and
twice the force acting on the other electron. This accounts for the linear product of charge
terms in the numerator of the inverse square law. In QED, photons do not interact with
each other (through force exchanges). As a result, in-going and out-going photons do not
affect  each  other  during  the  exchange  process,  thorugh  the  exchange  of  other  force
particles.

For gravitational forces, it is experimentally observed that the force originating from two
particles possessing mass decreases with the inverse square of their separation distance,
and is given by Newton’s inverse square law: F = Gm1m2 / r2, where G is the gravitational
constant, m1 and m2 are the masses, and r is the distance of separation. We have seen that
the two force laws are very similar in form. QED theory accounts for Coulomb’s law by
the photon exchange process. Following the lead from the highly successful QED, EMQG
replaces the concept of electrical ‘charges’  exchanging ‘photons’  with the idea that ‘mass
charges’  exchange  gravitons.  Hence,  gravitational  mass  at  a  fundamental  level  is  simply

23

the ability to emit or absorb gravitons, and pure low-level gravitational mass is interpreted
as ‘mass charge’  of a fermion.

For gravity there are gravitons instead of photons, which are the force exchange particles
of gravity. Like charge, it is the property called mass-charge that determines the number of
exchange gravitons. The larger the mass, the greater the number of gravitons exchanged.
Like electromagnetism, the strength of the gravity force decreases with the inverse square
of the distance. This conceptual framework for quantum gravity has been around for some
time  now,  but  how  are  we  to  merge  these  simple  ideas  to  be  compatible  with  the
framework  of  general  relativity?  We  must  be  able  to  explain  the  Einstein's  Principle  of
Equivalence and the physical connection between inertia, gravity, and curved space-time
all within the general framework of graviton particle exchange. General Relativity is based
on  the  idea  that  the  forces  experienced  in  a  gravitational  field  and  the  forces  due  to
acceleration are equivalent, and both are due to the space-time curvature.

In  classical  electromagnetism,  if  a  charged  particle  is  accelerated  towards  an  opposite
charged  particle,  the  rate  of  acceleration  depends  on  the  electrical  charge  value.  If  the
charge is doubled, the force doubles, and the rate of acceleration is doubled. If quantum
gravity were to work in the exact same way, we would expect that the rate of acceleration
of a mass near the earth would double if the mass doubles. The reason for this expectation
is that the exchange process for gravitons should be very similar to electromagnetism. In
other words, if the ‘mass-charge’  is doubled, the gravitational force is doubled. The only
difference between the two forces is that gravity is a lot weaker by a factor of about 10-40.
The  weakness  of  the  gravitational  forces  might  be  attributed  either  to  the  very  small
interaction cross-section of the graviton particle as compared to the photon particle, or to
a  very  weak  coupling  constant  (the  absorption  of  a  single  graviton  causing  a  minute
amount of acceleration), or both.

Unfortunately, if the graviton exchange process worked exactly like QED, it would not
reproduce  the  known  nature  of  gravity.  First,  there  is  the  problem  of  variation  of  mass
with velocity as described by special relativity as m= m0  (1-v2/c2)-1/2 . At face value, this
would  mean  that  the  number  of  gravitons  exchanged  depends  on  velocity  of  the
gravitational mass, which does not easily fit into the framework of a QED type approach
to quantum gravity.

Secondly, if two masses are sitting on a table with mass ‘M’  and mass ‘2M’, the forces
against  the  tabletop  varies  with  the  mass,  just  as  you  would  expect  in  a  QED-like
exchange of graviton particles. If the mass doubles, the force on the table doubles. Yet,
the rate of acceleration is the same for these two masses in free fall. Why? Since twice the
number of gravitons is exchanged under mass ‘2M’  in free, you would expect twice the
force, and therefore mass ‘2M’  should arrive early. Matter has inertia, and this complicates
everything.  In  almost  all  quantum  gravity  theories  inertia  appears  as  a  separate  process
that is ‘tacked’  on in an ad hoc manner. As we said, the principle of equivalence merely
raises  this  relationship  between  inertia  and  gravitation  to  the  status  of  a  postulate  as  in
Einstein’s theory of general relativity.

24

All test masses accelerate at the same rate (g=9.8 m/sec2 on the earth) no matter what the
value  of  the  test  mass  is.  This  is  a  direct  consequence  of  the  principle  of  equivalence.
Mathematically, this follows from Newton's two  different force laws: inertia and gravity
as follows:

Fi = ma        
Fg = GmM / r2 

..... (Inertial force)
..... (Gravitational force)

(6. 1)
(6. 2)

If in free fall, an object (mass m) in the presence of the earth's pull (mass M) is force free,
then Fi = Fg (since no other forces are present). Note that the same mass value ‘m’  appears
in the two mass definition formulas for equations 6.1 and 6.2.

Therefore,  ma = GmM/ r2   or  a = GM/ r2  for the mass, independent of the value of the
mass m. Thus we see that the rate of acceleration does not depend on the test mass m. All
test masses accelerate at the same rate. Thus, inertia and gravity are intimately connected
in a deep way because the measure of mass m is the same for acceleration as for gravity.

What  is  mass?  In  EMQG,  gravitational  mass  originates  from  a  low-level  graviton
exchange  process  that  results  from  ‘mass  charge’,  where  there  the  emission  rate  is
constant. In fact, mass is quantized in exactly the same way as electric charge in QED.
(There exists a fundamental unit of mass charge that is carried by the masseon particle, the
lowest quanta of mass). The graviton ultimately responsible for the gravitational force.

We have seen that the graviton particle is the fundamental boson of the pure gravitational
force.  In  EMQG,  the  graviton  is  very  similar  to  the  photon  in  physical  characteristics.
Both  particles  move  at  the  speed  of  light,  and  have  the  same  spin  1  (contrary  to
conventional wisdom). Both bosons have rest mass of zero. The following table compares
the properties of the graviton with the photon particle:

Gravitons  are  emitted  and  absorbed  by  the  ‘masseon’  particle,  which  is  the  most
elementary form of matter or anti-matter. The masseon carries the lowest possible quanta
of gravitational ‘mass charge’. This elementary particle is called the masseon particle (and
also  comes  in  anti-masseon  varieties,  which  is  the  corresponding  anti-particle).  The
masseon is postulated to be the smallest fundamental mass particle and readily combines

25

g
with other masseons through a new, hypothetical force coupling, which we call the ‘primal
force’. Presumably, the primal force comes in positive and negative ‘primal charge’  types.
The proposed mediator of this force is called the ‘primon’  particle.

Since the masseon has not yet been detected by particle collisions, we can safely assume
that the primal force is very strong. It is not necessary to understand the exact nature of
the primal force to achieve and understanding of the principle of equivalence. Suffice it to
say that the primal force binds together masseon particles to make all the known  fermion
particles of the standard model. The masseon carries the lowest possible quanta of positive
gravitational ‘mass charge’.

Gravitational ‘mass charge’  is defined as the fixed rate of emission of graviton particles in
close analogy to electric charge in QED  (actually the probability of emission/absorption).
Recall that the graviton is the vector boson of the pure gravitational force. Gravitational
‘mass charge’  is a fixed constant in EMQG, and is analogous to the fixed electrical charge
concept.  Gravitational  ‘mass  charge’  is not  governed  by  the  ordinary  physical  laws  of
observable mass, which includes Einstein’s energy and mass-velocity variation formulae:
E=mc2 and m = m0 (1 - v2/c2)-1/2 .

Gravitational  ‘mass  charge’  is  the low-level  mass  of  a  particle,  should  not  be  confused
with  the  ordinary  observable  inertial  or  observable  gravitational  mass  properties  of  a
particle. These are not the same. It will be assumed that when we use the term ‘low level
mass charge’  in this paper, we are talking about the low level gravitational ‘mass charge’
property of a particle, and the associated graviton exchange process. Gravitational mass is
the observable mass property that is measured in actual experiments.

Another  important  property  exhibited  by  the  graviton  particle  is  the  principle  of
superposition.  This  property  works  exactly  the  same  way  as  it  does  for  photons.  The
action  of  the  gravitons  originating  from  several  different  sources  acts  to  yield  a  net
acceleration vector sum that determines the state of acceleration for a receiving particle.
EMQG  treats  graviton  exchanges  by  the  same  successful  methods  developed  for  the
behavior  of  photons  in  QED.  The  dimensionless  coupling  constant  that  governs  the
graviton  exchange  process  is  what  we  call  ‘b ‘  in  close  analogy  with  the dimensionless
coupling  constant  ‘a ‘  in  QED,  where b
,  tremendously  weaker  than  electrical
forces.

As  we  said,  the  masseon  particle  is  the  fundamental  fermion  that  carries  both  electrical
charge and mass charge. It is very similar to the electron in physical characteristics, where
the  electron  is  a  composite  of  many  masseons.  The  following  tables  compares  the
properties of the masseon particle with the electron particle:

Masseons simultaneously carry a positive gravitational ‘mass charge’, and either a positive
or  negative  electrical  charge  (defined  exactly  as  in  QED).  Therefore,  masseons  also
exchange photons with other  masseon particles. It is important to note that the graviton
exchange process is responsible for the low-level gravitational interaction only, which is
not directly accessible to our measurements (as we will see later), and is also masked by
the presence of the electromagnetic force component in all gravitational measurements.

Masseons  are  fermions  with  half  integer  spin,  which  behave  according  to  the  rules  of
quantum  field  theory.  Gravitons  have  a  spin  of  one  (not  spin  two,  as  is  commonly
thought),  and  travel  at  the  speed  of  light.  This  paper  addresses  the  gravitational  and
electromagnetic  force  interactions  only,  and  the  strong  and  weak  nuclear  forces  are
ignored here. (Masseons also carry the strong and weak ‘nuclear charge’  as well, which is
outside the scope of this work).

Anti-masseons  carry  the  lowest  quanta  of  negative  gravitational  ‘mass  charge’.  Anti-
masseons  also  carry  either  positive  or  negative  electrical  charge,  with  electrical  charge
being  defined  according  to  QED.  An  anti-masseon  is  always  created  with  ordinary
masseon in a particle pair, as required by quantum field theory. The negative energy, or
the antimatter solution to the famous Dirac equation for fermions in quantum field theory
is also the  negative ‘mass charge’  solution for that fermion. Therefore we propose that
the  symmetry  between  matter  and  anti-matter  is  perfect  in  Dirac’s  equation. Every
physical parameter is reversed in the anti-matter solution of Diarc’s equation, where
previously  mass  remained  positive,  and  the  other  physical  quantities  such  as,  energy,
electrical charge, spin, etc. were reversed when going from matter to anti-matter.

Ordinarily the standard model requires that the mass of any anti-particle is always positive,
in order to comply with the Einstein principle of equivalence, or M  i= Mg. In EMQG, the
principle  of  equivalence  is  not  taken  to  be  an  absolute  law  of  nature,  and  is  definitely
grossly violated for anti-particles (the reasons will become clear in section 8). The anti-
particles can have both positive inertia mass and negative gravitational mass, or Mi = -Mg.
This  violates  equivalence  and  general  relativity,  and  so  is  an  experimentally  testable
consequence of EMQG theory (section 10, and ref. 1).

There  exists  a  beautiful  symmetry  between  EMQG  and  QED  for  gravitational  and
electromagnetic forces. The masseon-graviton interaction becomes almost identical to the
electron-photon  interaction.  There  are  only  two  differences  between  these  forces.  First,
the ratio of the strength of the electromagnetic over the gravitational forces is on the order

27

of 1040 for an electron. Secondly, there exists a difference in the nature of attraction and
repulsion  between  positive  and  negative  gravitational  ‘mass-charges’  (as  detailed  in  the
table #3 and 4 below). The reason for this slight asymmetry is still an unresolved problem
in  EMQG  theory.  We  would  normally  expect  that  a  perfect  symmetry  should  exist
between the photon and the graviton.

In  QED,  the  quantum  vacuum,  as  a  whole,  is  electrically  neutral  over  macroscopic
distance scales,  because the virtual electron and positron (negative electron) particles are
always  created  in  particle  pairs  with  equal  numbers  of  positive  and  negative  electrical
charge. In EMQG,  the quantum vacuum is also gravitationally ‘neutral’  for the same
reason.  At  any  given  instant  of  time,  there  is  a  50-50  mixture  of  positive  and  negative
virtual  gravitational  ‘mass  charge’,  which  is  carried  by  the  virtual masseon  and  anti-
masseon  pairs.  These  masseon  /  anti-masseon  particle  pairs  are  created  with  equal  and
opposite gravitational ‘mass charge’. This is the reason why the cosmological constant is
zero (or very close to zero, ref. 1). Half the graviton exchanges between quantum vacuum
particles  result  in  attraction,  while  the  other  half  result  in  gravitational  repulsion.  The
result is a neutral masseon vacuum. To see how this works, we will closely examine how
masseons and anti-masseons interact.

The following tables compares the fundamental attractive and repulsive characteristics of
two  electrical  charged  electrons  or  anti-electrons,  and  two  masseons  or  anti-masseons
possessing ‘mass charge’, all undergoing electrical or gravitational force interactions:

28

In QED, if the source particle is an electron, it emits photons whose wave function induce
repulsion  when  absorbed  by  the  destination  electron,  and  induces  attraction  when
absorbed by a destination anti-electron. Similarly, if the source is an anti-electron, it emits
photons whose wave function induce attraction when absorbed by the destination electron,
and induces repulsion when absorbed by a destination anti-electron.

In  EMQG,  if  the  source  particle  is  a  masseon,  it  emits  gravitons  whose  wave  function
induces attraction when absorbed by a destination masseon, and induces attraction when
absorbed by a destination anti-masseon. If the source is an anti-masseon, it emits gravitons
whose  wave  function  induces  repulsion  when  absorbed  by  a  destination  masseon,  and
induces repulsion when absorbed by a destination anti-masseon. This subtle difference in
the nature of graviton exchange process is responsible for some major differences in the
way that low-level gravitational ‘mass charge’  and the electrical charges operate.

It is convenient to think of the photon as occurring in photon and anti-photon varieties
(the  photon  is  its  own  anti-particle).  Similarly,  the  graviton  comes  in  graviton  and  anti-
graviton varieties. Thus, we can say that the  masseons emit gravitons, and anti-masseons
emit  anti-gravitons.  The  absorption  of  a  graviton  by  either  a  masseon  or  anti-masseon
induces attraction. The absorption of an anti-graviton by either a masseon or anti-masseon
induces repulsion. Similarly, we can say the electrons emit photons and anti-electrons emit
anti-photons.  The  absorption  of  a  photon  by  an  electron  induces  repulsion,  and  the
absorption of a photon by an anti-electron induces attraction. The absorption of an anti-
photon by an electron induces attraction, and the absorption of an anti-photon by an anti-
electron induces repulsion. Now that we have characterized the masseons and gravitons,
let us reexamine the nature of the quantum vacuum from the perspective of EMQG.

6.1

THE QUANTUM VACUUM AND VIRTUAL MASSEON PARTICLES

In this paper we talk extensively about virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. Precisely
what kinds of virtual particles are present in the quantum vacuum? In QED, we talk about
the vacuum being populated with virtual electrons and anti-electrons (and virtual muons
and  tauons  in  the  second  and  third  generation  of  elementary  particles),  along  with  the
associated virtual photons. In the standard model of particle physics the quantum vacuum
consists  of  all  varieties  of  virtual  fermion  and  virtual  boson  particles  representing  the
known virtual matter and virtual force particles, respectively. These include fermions such
as virtual electrons, virtual quarks, virtual neutrinos. This also includes bosons such as the
virtual photons, virtual gluons, and virtual W and Z bosons.

In EMQG, we restrict ourselves to the study of gravity and electromagnetism. Therefore,
the EMQG quantum vacuum consists of the virtual masseons and virtual anti-masseons,
and  the  associated  virtual  photons  and  virtual  graviton  particles  (virtual  masseon  can
combine to form virtual electrons, etc.). Recall that ordinary matter consists only of real
masseons bound together in certain combinations to form the familiar elementary particles.

29

We now ask how the virtual electrons and positrons of the QED vacuum behave in the
vicinity of a real electrical charge. We want to compare this behavior with virtual masseon
and virtual anti-masseon near a real and very large mass-charge like the earth.

First, we review how the QED quantum vacuum is affected by the introduction of a real
negative  electrical  charge.  According  to  QED,  the  nearby  virtual  particle  pairs  become
polarized around the central charge. This means that the virtual electrons of the quantum
vacuum are repelled away from the central negative charge, while the virtual positrons are
crowded  towards  the  central  negative  charge.  For  real  electrons  this  process  is  called
‘vacuum  polarization’,  and  produces  the  well  known  phenomena  of  electric  charge
screening. Electric charge screening reduces the apparent electric charge of a real electron,
when measured over relatively long distances away from the charge.

According to QED, each electron is surrounded by a cloud of virtual particles that winks
in and out of existence in pairs (lasting tiny fractions of a second), and this cloud is always
present and acts like an electrical shield against the real charge of the electron. Recently, a
team  of  physicists  led  by  D.  Koltick  of  Purdue  University  in  Indiana  reported  charge
screening for an electron, experimentally, at the KEK collider (ref. 33). They fired high-
energy  particles  at  electrons  and  found  that  the  charge  screening  effect  of  this  cloud  of
virtual particles was reduced the closer a high-energy charged particle penetrated towards
the  electron.  They  report  that  the  effect  of  the  higher  charge  for  an  electron,  that  was
penetrated  by  particles  accelerated  to  an  energy  58  giga-electron  volts,  was  equivalent
experimentally  to  a  fine  structure  constant  of  1/129.6.  This  agreed  well  with  the
theoretical prediction of 1/128.5, based on QED.

Now we study how the EMQG quantum vacuum is affected by the introduction of a large
mass like the earth. According to EMQG, the quantum vacuum virtual masseon particle
pairs are not polarized near a large mass, as we found for electrons (as can be seen from
table #3 above). The virtual masseon and anti-masseon pairs are both attracted towards
the mass. It is this lack of vacuum polarization that results in the main difference between
electromagnetism and gravity. This is an extremely important result of EMQG theory.

The earth does not produce vacuum polarization of virtual particles (as far as mass charge
is concerned). In large gravitational fields, all the virtual masseon and virtual anti-masseon
particles  of  the  vacuum  have  more  or  less  the  same  net  average  statistical  acceleration
directed towards a large mass, and produces a net inward flux of quantum vacuum virtual
masseon/anti-masseon particles (acceleration vectors only) that can, and does, affect other
masses placed nearby. In contrast to this, a large electrically charged object does produce
vacuum polarization in QED; where the positive and negative electric charges accelerates
towards and away, respectively from the charged object. Hence in QED there is no energy
contribution  to  other  electrical  test  charges  placed  nearby  (from  the  vacuum  particles
only),  because  the  charged  vacuum  particles  contributes  equal  amounts  of  force
contributions from both directions, i.e. towards and away from the large charge.

30

On  the  earth,  the  lack  of  vacuum  polarization  leads  us  towards  the  weak  equivalence
principle.  This  is  because  both  the  electrically  charged  positive  and  negative  virtual
masseons  and  anti-masseon  particles  can  act  in  unison  against  the  electrically  charged
particles  that  make  up  a  test  mass  dropped  on  the  earth.  Had  there  been  vacuum
polarization for the masseons as far as mass-charge was concerned, the virtual and anti-
virtual vacuum particles would accelerate in the two opposite directions from the earth,
and  hence  no  net  vacuum  force  would  result  against  a  test  mass  from  the  vacuum.  We
have introduced all the major players in EMQG, and we are now ready to state our basic
postulates. At this time, these postulates cannot be derived from more basic principles.

VIRTUAL PARTICLES NEAR SPHERICAL MASS LIKE THE EARTH

We  now  have  enough  background  material  to  determine  the  quantum  nature  of  the
gravitational  field  for  a  spherically  symmetrical,  large  mass  like  the  earth.  In  general
relativity, Einstein’s field equation has been solved exactly for this special case (ref. 39),
and the solution is called the Schwarzchild metric (after the discoverer) and is given by:

This is a complete mathematical description of the 4D space-time curvature according to
general relativity, and also describes the motion of mass near the earth. The metric is given
in  spherical  coordinates.  This  equation  describes  the  path  that  light  (or  matter  with
additional considerations) takes through the curved 4 D space-time. We will find that this
solution  is  a  very  good  approximation  to  the  quantum  gravitational  field.  There  are,
however,  hidden  quantum  processes  involving  the  virtual  particles  in  EMQG  that  are
responsible  for  this  curvature,  and  for  the  very  tiny  inaccuracy  of  this  metric  due  to  a
slight violation of the principle of equivalence (section 8). We will also see that the metric
has a limited range of applicability, and cannot be used on the individual particle scale as r
(cid:224) 0 (due to quantization).

A  large  spherical  mass  turns  out  to  have  a  very  simple  motion  associated  with  the
electrically charged virtual particles that makes up the surrounding quantum vacuum. The
normal vacuum condition of the virtual particles near a massive spherical distribution of
matter is disrupted, compared to the similar vacuum state in far empty space. Surrounding
a  large  spherically  symmetrical  mass  like  the  earth,  the  virtual  particles  created  in  the
quantum  vacuum  have  a  net  average  acceleration  vector  that  is  directed  downward
towards  the  earth's  center  along  radius  vectors.  (Note:  We  are  ignoring  the  mutual
interactions  of  the  vacuum  particles,  which  are  why  this  statement  must  remain  as  a
statistical statement of an average virtual particle).

The cause of this downward acceleration of the vacuum is the  direct graviton exchanges
between the real masseons that constitute the earth and the virtual masseon particles of the

31

-
-
-
W
quantum vacuum, which propagate at the speed of light. At any one instant, the vacuum
particles have random velocity vectors, which point in all directions (even including the up
direction).  However,  the  acceleration  vectors  are  generally  pointing  in  the  downward
direction, on the whole.

The closer the virtual particles are to the earth, the greater the acceleration, as you would
expect  from  the  inverse  square  law.  On  the  quantum  scale  is  due  to  the  geometric
spreading of the graviton flux (ref. 1), which gives less graviton flux at greater distances.
We  conclude  that  the  net  average  acceleration  of  the  falling  virtual  particles  is  directed
towards the earth’s center, and the magnitude of the acceleration vector varies with the
inverse square of the height ‘r’.

This  accelerated  vacuum  ‘flow’,  which  permeates  all  matter  on  the  earth,  plays  an
important  role  in  the  dynamics  of  gravity  in  EMQG.  It  also  naturally  ties  in  with  the
problem  of  inertia  and  the  equivalence  principle.  We  suggest  that  the  average  net
acceleration vector of the electrically charged vacuum particles, which varies in magnitude
and direction at different points near the earth, interacts with test masses and with light in
such  a  way  as  to  be  equivalent  to  Schwarzschild  4D  space-time  metric  concept  above.
This is because the average net acceleration vector of the charged virtual particles at each
point 
in  space  surrounding  the  mass,  guides  the  motion  of  the  real  photons
electromagnetically,  and  also  guides  the  motion  of  real  electrically  charged  masseon
particles that make up a mass. From simple considerations of the inverse square law of
gravity, we easily obtain the general motion of the falling vacuum particles near the earth,
and is given by:

The  magnitude  and  direction  of  the  acceleration  of  an  average,  falling,  electrically
charged  virtual  masseon  particle  of  the  surrounding  quantum  vacuum  at  point  ‘r’
above the earth of mass Me is given by:

r
a

=

r
re

GM
r

3

(7.2)

where  rr  is the radius vector and  ra  is the acceleration vector. The direction of the virtual
particle acceleration is along the earth’s radius vectors. It is also possible to calculate this
from  the  basic  EMQG  field  equations  for  a  general,  slow  mass  (ref.  1).  However,  this
complex calculation of the state of motion of the vacuum particles is not required in the
case of large spherically symmetrical masses like the earth, because of the symmetry and
simplicity of the inverse square law for a spherically large mass like the earth.

When  a  small  test  mass  moves  through  the  space  surrounding  the  earth,  the  electrical
interactions between the real charged masseon  particles  in  the  mass  with  respect  to  the
virtual  charged  particles  quantum  vacuum  dominates  over  the  pure  graviton  exchange
process between the test mass and the earth. This electrical component plays the major
role  in  the  dynamics  of  motion  of  a  nearby  test  mass.  The  real  masseon  particles  that
constitute  the  mass  of  the  earth  exchanges  gravitons  with  the  virtual  masseons  of  the

32

-
quantum  vacuum,  causing  a  downward  acceleration  of  the  quantum  vacuum  with  a
magnitude of 1g at the earth’s surface.

If we now introduce a test mass near the earth, the real masseons making up the test mass
will fall at the same average rate as that of the net statistical average of virtual particles of
the  vacuum.  This  is  due  to  the  vastly  stronger  electrical  forces  acting  between  the
electrically charged virtual  masseons of the surrounding vacuum and the real, electrically
charged masseons of the test mass. In some sense, the vacuum acts like a much stronger
constraining force that guides the motion of a masseon so that it follows a ‘geodesic’  path
through space.

Note:  We  have  not  proved  that  equation  (7.2)  is  correct.  Instead,  it  is  based  on  the
general  observations  of  the  motion  of  a  test  mass  falling  near  the  earth  based  on  the
inverse sqaure law, where the electrical forces from the falling vacuum constrains the fall
rate of a point-like test mass.. However, this equation can be derived from first principles
using  the  semi-classical  EMQG  equations  of  motion  (ref.  1).  Because  equation  7.2
involves  space  and  time,  a  small  correction  (for  the  earth)  needs  to  be  applied  to
compensate for space-time effects as well, since equation 7.2 involves distance and time
(ref. 1).

To fully understand the gravitational field around a spherically symmetrical massive object
like the earth, the motion of light near the earth must also be accounted for in EMQG. We
will find that the altered behavior of light near a massive object drastically modifies the
nature of space-time in equation. This is because the acceleration a=dv/dt, and the velocity
v=dx/dt involves distance and time measurements. We will return to this important issue
of the meaning of curved 4D space-time in section 9, after deriving the weak principle of
equivalence for the motion of matter, from the fundamental postulates of EMQG.

DERIVATION OF THE WEAK PRINCIPLE OF EQUIVALENCE

“The  principle  of  equivalence  performed  the  essential  office  of  midwife  at  the  birth  of  general
relativity, but, as Einstein remarked, the infant would never have got beyond its long clothes had it not
been for Minkowski’s concept [of space-time geometry]. I suggest that the midwife be now buried with
appropriate honors and the facts of absolute space-time faced.”

- Synge

We now derive the principle of equivalence from the motion of the virtual particles in the
vacuum surrounding the earth. As we stated, the equality of inertial and gravitational mass
is known to be true only through physical observation and through experience. Yet until
recently, it has been generally believed that it cannot be derived from more fundamental
principles. However is the equivalence principle truly an exact statement of the nature of
physical reality?

33

8.1

INTRODUCTION

Again,  there  are  two  main  formulations  of  the  principle  of  equivalence.  The  strong
equivalence  principle  states  that  the  results  of  any  given  physical  experiment  will  be
precisely identical for an accelerated observer in free space as it is for a non-accelerated
observer in a perfectly uniform gravitational field. A weaker form of this postulate restricts
itself to the laws of motion of masses only. In other words, the laws of motion of identical
masses on the earth are identical to the same situation inside an accelerated rocket (at 1g).
We  have  shown  (section  5.1)  that  objects  of  different  mass  all  fall  at  the  same  rate  of
acceleration  in  a  uniform  gravity  field.  In  regards  to  the  strong  equivalence  principle,
Synge writes:

 “…  I never been able to understand this Principle …  Does it mean that the effects of a
gravitational field are indistinguishable from the effects of an observer’s acceleration? If
so, it is false. In Einstein’s theory, either there is a gravitational field or there’s none,
according as the Riemann tensor does not or does vanish. This is an absolute property. It
has  nothing  to  do  with  any  observer’s  world  line  …  The  principle  of  equivalence
performed  the  essential  office  of  midwife  at  the  birth  of  general  relativity,  but,  as
Einstein  remarked,  the  infant  would  never  have  got  beyond  its  long  clothes  had  it  not
been for  Minkowski’s  concept  [of  space-time  geometry].  I  suggest  that  the  midwife  be
now buried with appropriate honors and the facts of absolute space-time faced.”

Few physicists would doubt the validity of his statement. Synge has hit on an important
point in regards to the nature of the equivalence principle and space-time. He is right to
say that “either there is a gravitational field or there’s none, according as the Riemann
tensor does not or does vanish. This is an absolute property (of space near a large mass)”.

What he means is that the Riemann tensor describing curvature is there, or is not there,
depending on whether or not there is a large mass present to distort space-time. (in other
words,  whether  there  exists  a  global  space-time  curvature  or  not).  There  is  nothing
relative  about  this  fact.  The  existence  of  a  global  space-time  curvature  reveals  whether
you are in a gravitational field. In an accelerated frame, the space-time curvature is local to
your  motion  only,  and  is  not  global  property  of  4D  space-time.  For  accelerated  motion
from gravitational fields, the global 4D space-time is flat, but the local 4D space-time for
the accelerated observer is curved.

There is no mystery here according to EMQG. If a large mass is present, the mass emits
huge  numbers  of  graviton  particles,  and  distorts  the  surrounding  virtual  particles  of  the
quantum vacuum. This is an absolute statement about the physical nature of the vacuum
there. In an accelerated frame, there are very few gravitons, and the quantum vacuum is
not affected. However, an observer in the accelerated frame ‘sees’  the quantum vacuum
accelerating with respect to his frame in the same way, and hence the background vacuum
state  is  the  same.  However,  globally  the  quantum  vacuum  still  remains  (mostly)
undisturbed for accelerated motion.

34

In other words, on a global scale, i.e. on a scale larger that the accelerated observer and
his local frame, the state of relative acceleration of the quantum vacuum is uniform. Thus
we conclude that the equivalence principle can be regarded as being a coincidence, due to
local  quantum  vacuum  acceleration  state  happening  to  appear  the  same  for  accelerated
observers as it does for a specific observer on the earth.

Recently,  we  uncovered  theoretical  evidence  that  suggests  that  the  strong  equivalence
principle  does  not  hold  in  certain  circumstances.  First,  if  gravitons  could  be  detected
experimentally  with  a  new  and  sensitive  graviton  detector  (which  is  not  likely  to  be
possible in the near future), we would be able to distinguish between an inertial frame and
a  gravitational  frame  with  this  detector.  This  would  be  possible  because  inertial  frames
would have virtually no graviton particles present, whereas the gravitational fields like the
earth  have  enormous  numbers  of  graviton  particles.  We  would  be  able  to  construct  a
device  with  an 
that  reads  ‘GRAVITATIONAL  FRAME’  or
‘ACCELERATED  FRAME’  by  setting  a  certain  threshold  on  the  graviton  count,  and
lighting the appropriate electronic indicator.

light 

Thus, we would have performed a physics experiment that can easily detect whether you
are  in  a  gravitational  field  or  an  accelerated  frame  in  clear  violation  of  the  strong
equivalence  principle.  Secondly,  recent  theoretical  considerations  of  the  emission  of
electromagnetic waves from a uniformly accelerated charge, and the lack of radiation from
the same charge subjected to a static gravitational field leads us to the conclusion that the
strong  equivalence  principle  also  does  not  hold  for  radiating  charged  particles.  Stephen
Parrott (ref 23) has done an extensive analysis of the electromagnetic energy released from
an accelerated charge in Minkowski space and a stationary charge in Schwarzchild space.
He  writes  in  his  paper  on  “Radiation  from  a  Uniformly  Accelerated  Charge  and  the
Equivalence Principle”:

“It  is  generally  accepted  that  any  accelerated  charge  in  Minkowski  space  radiates
energy. It is also accepted that a stationary charge in a static gravitational field does not
radiate energy. It would seem that these two facts imply that some forms of Einstein’s
Equivalence Principle do not apply to charged particles.

To  put  the  matter  in  an  easily  visualized  physical  framework,  imagine  that  the
acceleration  of  a  charged  particle  in  Minkowski  space  is  produced  by  a  tiny  rocket
engine  attached  to  the  particle.  Since  the  particle  is  radiating  energy,  that  can  be
detected  and  used,  conservation  of  energy  suggests  that  the  radiated  energy  must  be
furnished by the rocket. We must burn more fuel to produce a given accelerated world
line  than  we  would  to  produce  the  same  world  line  for  a  neutral  particle  of  the  same
mass.  Now  consider  a  stationary  charge  in  Schwarzchild  space-time,  and  suppose  a
rocket holds it stationary relative to the coordinate frame (accelerating with respect to
local inertial frames). In this case, since no radiation is produced, the rocket should use
the  same  amount  of  fuel  as  would  be  required  to  hold  stationary  a  similar  neutral
particle. This gives an experimental test by which we can determine locally whether we

35

are  accelerating  in  Minkowski  space  or  stationary  in  a  gravitational  field  -  simply
observe the rocket’s fuel consumption.”

He does a detailed analysis of the energy in Minkowski and Schwarzchild space-time, and
concludes  that  strong  principle  of  equivalence  does  not  hold  for  charged  particles  in
general. This is because the readout of the fuel consumed by the two rocket could be used
to  drive  an  indicator  light  to  reveal  whether  you  are  in  a  gravitational  field  or  in  an
accelerated frame.

As for the weak equivalence principle, so far we can now only specify the accuracy as to
which  the  two  different  mass  types  have  been  shown  experimentally  to  be  equal  in  an
inertial and gravitational field. In EMQG, we show that the equivalence principle follows
from lower level physical processes, and the basic postulates of EMQG. We will see that
mass equivalence arises from the equivalence of the electrical force generated between
the  net  statistical  average  acceleration  vectors  of  the  matter  particles  inside  a  mass
interacting  with  the  surrounding  quantum  vacuum  virtual  particles  inside  an
accelerating  rocket.  The  same  force  occurs  between  the  matter  particles  and  virtual
particles for a mass near the earth. We will show that weak equivalence is not perfect, and
breaks down when the accuracy of the measurement approaches forty decimal places of
accuracy!

Basically  mass  equivalence  arises  from  the  reversal  of  the  net  statistical  average
acceleration vectors between the charged matter particles and virtual, electrically charged,
particles in the famous Einstein rocket, with the same matter particles and virtual particles
process  occurring  near  the  earth  (figures  2  through  5).  To  fully  understand  the  hidden
quantum processes in the principle of equivalence on the earth, we will detail the behavior
of test masses and the propagation of light near the earth. Equivalence is shown to hold
for the motion of masses in two cases: stationary test masses on the floor, and for freely
falling test masses.

First we derive mass equivalence for stationary and falling masses. Next, we show that a
quantum principle of equivalence holds for individual elementary particles. Next, we will
demonstrate that equivalence also holds for large spherical masses with considerable self-
gravity (and self-energy) such as the earth with a hot molten core, and the moon with a
considerably colder core, with respect to the motion of third mass which is the sun. We
will see that if both the earth and the moon fall towards the sun, they would arrive at the
same time to a high degree of precision in the framework of EMQG. Finally, we examine
the principle of equivalence for curved Minkowski 4D space-time curvature in a rocket,
and on the earth, which is the 4D space-time equivalence.

8.1 MASSES INSIDE AN ACCELERATED ROCKET AT 1g

Figure  #2:  There  are  two  different  masses  at  rest  on  the  floor  of  a  rocket  which  is
accelerated  upwards  at  1  g  far  from  any  gravitational  sources.  The  floor  of  the  rocket

36

experiences a force under the mass ‘2M’  that  is  twice  as  great  as  for  the  mass  ‘M’.  In
Newtonian  physics,  the  inertial  mass  is  defined  in  precisely  this  way,  the  force  ‘F’  that
occurs when a mass ‘M’  is accelerated at rate ‘g’  as given by F=Mg. The quantum inertia
explanation for this is that the two masses are accelerated with respect to the net average
statistical motion of the virtual particles of the vacuum by the rocket. Since mass ‘2M’  has
twice  the  masseon  particle  count  as  mass  ‘M’,  the  sum  of  all  the  tiny  electrical  forces
between the virtual vacuum and the  masseon particles of mass ‘2M’  is twice as great as
compared  to  mass  ‘M’,  i.e.  for  mass  ‘M’,  F1=Mg  and  for  mass  ‘2M’,  F2=2Mg=2F1.
Because the particles that make up the masses do not maintain a net zero acceleration with
respect to the virtual particles, a force is always present from the rocket floor.

Figure #3: There are two different masses (M and 2M) that have just been released, and
are in free fall inside the rocket. According to Newtonian physics, no forces are present on
the two masses since the acceleration of both masses is zero (the masses are no longer
attached to the rocket frame). The two masses hit the rocket floor at the same time. The
quantum  inertia  explanation  for  this  is  trivial.  The  net  acceleration  between  all  the  real
masseons that make up both masses and virtual  masseon particles of the vacuum is a net
(statistical average) value of zero. The rocket floor simply reaches up to the two masses at
the same time, and thus unequal masses fall at the same rate inside an accelerated rocket
and arrive at the floor at the same time.

8.2 MASSES INSIDE A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD (THE EARTH)

Figure #4: There are the same two masses (2M and M) which are at rest on the surface of
the earth. The surface of the earth experiences a force under mass ‘2M’  that is twice as
great as for that under mass ‘M’. The reason for this is that the two stationary masses do
not  maintain  a  net  acceleration  of  zero  with  respect  to  the  net  statistical  average
acceleration  of  the  virtual  masseons  in  the  neighborhood.  This  is  because  the  virtual
particles are all (falling) accelerating towards the center of the earth (a=GM/r2) due to the
graviton  exchanges  between  the  real  masseons  consisting  of  the  earth  and  the  virtual
masseons of the vacuum. Since mass ‘2M’  has twice the masseon particles as mass ‘M’,
the  sum  of  all  the  tiny  electrical  forces  between  the  virtual  masseon  particles  of  the
vacuum and the real masseon particles of mass ‘2M’  is twice as great as that for mass ‘M’.
Thus, a force is required from the surface of the earth to maintain these masses at rest,
with mass ‘2M’  having twice the force of mass ‘M’. The physics of this force is the same
as  for  figure  #3  in  the  rocket,  but  now  the  relative  acceleration  frames  of  the  virtual
charged masseons and the real charged masseon particles of the mass are interchanged
(with the exception of the direct graviton induced forces on the masses, which is negligible
and discussed later).

Figure #5: There are two different masses (M and 2M) that have just been released, and
are in free fall towards the earth (no external forces are present on the two masses). The
two masses hit the earth at the same time. The relative average acceleration of the real
masseon  particles  that  make  up  the  two  masses  with  respect  to  the  electrically  charged

37

virtual  masseon  particles  of  the  vacuum  is  zero,  because  both  masses  and  the  quantum
vacuum are accelerated at the same rate through graviton exchanges with the earth.

The electrical forces between the virtual particles and the matter particles of the test mass
dominates the local interactions, because the electrical force is 1040 times stronger than the
graviton  component.  Although  mass  ‘2M’  has  twice  the pure  gravitational  force  (i.e.
forces contributed from direct graviton exchanges with the earth) due to twice the number
of  graviton  exchanges,  this  is  totally  swamped  out  by  the  electrical  interaction,  and  the
accelerated  virtual  particles  and  the  test  masses  are  in  a  state  of  electrical  force
equilibrium, as far as acceleration vectors are concerned. Both masses fall at the same rate
(neglecting  the  slight  imbalance  of  the  graviton  component).  In  fact,  in  both  cases  (i.e.
accelerated and gravitational) there is a net equilibrium between the accelerated state of
masseons in the mass and virtual masseons of the quantum vacuum (as far as their relative
acceleration is concerned, which is zero). Therefore, the two unequal masses fall to the
surface of the earth at the same acceleration, and arrive at the same time.

NEWTONIAN MASS EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE

Newton  was  aware  of  the  mass  equivalence  principle,  i.e.  the  inertial  mass  and  the
gravitational  mass  of  an  object  are  the  same.  We  now  revisit  the  equivalence  principle
from  Newton’s  perspective,  bearing  in  mind  these  hidden  quantum  processes  we  just
described.  Now  the  elegant  picture  developed  above  can  even  be  seen  to  be  hidden  in
Newton’s formulation of accelerated motion and gravity. Equivalence between the inertial
mass ‘M’  on a rocket moving with acceleration ‘A’, and gravitational mass ‘M’  under the
influence  of  a  gravitational  field  with  acceleration  ‘A’  can  be  seen  to  follow  from
Newton’s laws if we look at them in the slightly different way:

Fi  = M (A)         ... Stationary vacuum opposes acceleration A of the mass ‘M’  in rocket.
Fg = M (GMe/r2) ... Accelerated vacuum (A= GMe/r2) opposes the stationary mass ‘M’.

Viewed in this way, even Newton’s law of gravity looks a lot like his famous third law
of inertia, i.e. Newton’s ‘F = GMeM/r2’  looks a lot like ‘F = M A’. Under gravity, the
magnitude  of  the  gravitational  acceleration  is  ‘A=GMe/r2’,  which  is  the  same  as  the
magnitude  of  the  acceleration  of  the  rocket.  Switching  to  the  reference  frame  of  an
average  electrically  charged  masseon  in  the  mass  ‘M’  in  both  cases,  it  ‘sees’  a  typical
virtual masseon particle in the vacuum near the earth in exactly the same way as a typical
virtual masseon in the rocket. In other words, the accelerated quantum vacuum particle
state appears the same from the perspective of the mass in an accelerated frame and
the same mass on the earth. This is the basis of Newtonian mass equivalence.

This example shows why both the masses of figure 2 and 3 are equivalent to the masses in
figure  4  and  5.  The  force  magnitude  is  the  same  because  the  calculation  of  the  force
involves the same sum of all the tiny electrical forces between the virtual charged masseon
particles and the real masseon particles of the mass. The only difference in the physics of

38

the  masses  is  that  the  relative  motions  of  all  the  tiny  electrical  force  vectors  are
interchanged.  The  other  difference  is  that  large  numbers  of  graviton  particles  (that
originate from the earth’s mass) are absorbed by the masses in figures 4 and 5 for the earth
case, while for the rocket there are negligible gravitons present.

To summarize, two unequal masses in free fall hit the surface of the earth at the same time.
The  net  statistical  average  acceleration  of  the  real  masseon  particles  that  make  up  the
masses and virtual charged masseon particles of the vacuum is zero, because this process
is dominated by the electrical force (where the direct graviton exchanges are negligible).
The electrical forces between the virtual particles and the matter particles of the test mass
dominates  the  interactions,  because  the  electrical  force  is  1040  times  stronger  than  the
graviton component.

Although mass ‘2M’  has twice the pure gravitational force (i.e. forces contributed from
direct  graviton  exchanges  only  with  the  earth)  due  to  twice  the  number  of  graviton
exchanges,  this  is  totally  swamped  out  by  the  electrical  interaction,  and  the  accelerated
virtual  particles  and  the  test  masses  are  in  a  state  of  electrical  equilibrium  as  far  as
acceleration vectors are concerned. Both masses fall at the same rate. In fact, in both cases
(i.e. accelerated and gravitational) there is a net equilibrium between the accelerated state
of  masseons  in  the  mass  and  virtual  masseons  of  the  quantum  vacuum  as  far  as  their
relative acceleration is concerned.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MASS EQUIVALENCE IS NOT PERFECT IN
THE ROCKET AND IN THE EARTH-BOUND EXPERIMENTS ABOVE!

First, the processes in figures 2 and 3 are physically different then in figure 4 and 5. The
most important difference is that gravitons are present on the earth, but not in the rocket
(strictly  speaking  there  are  negligible  numbers  of  gravitons  from  the  rocket  structure).
Secondly, the force contributed by the direct graviton exchanges between the mass and the
earth slightly imbalance the equivalence of the fall rate for the two unequal masses. This
discrepancy  in  the  free  fall  rate  of  test  masses  near  the  earth  is  extremely  minute  in
magnitude because there is a ratio of about 1040 in the field strength existing between the
electromagnetic and gravitational forces. In principle it could be measured by extremely
sensitive  experiments,  if  two  test  masses  are  chosen  with  a  very  large  mass  difference,
which would amplify this effect (ref. 1).

Does the weak equivalence principle hold for an individual elementary particle?

8.3 MICROSCOPIC EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE OF PARTICLES

We  have  been  talking  about  macroscopic  masses  until  now.  What  about  the  case  for
elementary particles? For example, does a proton and an electron simultaneously dropped
on  the  surface  of  the  earth  fall  at  the  same  rate?  In  other  words,  if  both  particles  are
dropped inside a rocket that is accelerating at 1 g and also on the earth, would they arrive

39

on the floor at the same time? The answer is yes. In fact, the equivalence principle has
actually been experimentally verified for the case of the neutron (ref. 40).

An astute observer may have questioned our reasoning all along, by asking why all the
virtual particles (for example, virtual neutrons, virtual electrons, virtual quarks, etc., which
all  consist  of  different  mass  values)  are  falling  at  the  same  rate.  Certainly  inside  an
accelerated  rocket  an  observer  who  is  stationed  on  the  floor  will  view  all  the  virtual
particles of the quantum accelerating with respect to him at the same rate, no matter what
the  masses  of  the  virtual  particles  are.  This  is  simply  because  the  floor  of  the  rocket
accelerates upwards at 1g to meet them, giving the illusion (to an observer on the rocket)
that virtual particles of different mass are falling at the same rate.

Since the masses of the different types of virtual particles are all different according to the
standard model of particle physics, why are they all falling at the same rate on the earth?
Here the cause of the downward acceleration is due to graviton exchanges with the earth.
Shouldn’t the virtual particles with with greater mass charge fall at a faster rate? Since we
are trying to derive the equivalence principle from fundamental concepts, we cannot resort
to this principle itself to state that the virtual particles must be accelerating at the same
rate on the earth.  In order to solve this puzzle, we have to postulate the existence of a
fundamental  mass  charge  unit  for  all  fermion  particles,  which  is  carried  by  the
masseon particle.

As  we  have  indicated,  all  particles  with  mass  (virtual  or  not)  must  be  composed  of
combinations of the fundamental “masseon”  particle, which carries just one fixed quanta of
mass charge (postulate #2). Since all virtual masseon  particles  exchange  the  same  fixed
flux of gravitons with the earth, all the virtual masseons are all falling at the same rate.
However,  we  must  bear  in  mind  that  virtual  masseons  can  bind  momentarily  combine
together  to  form  all  the  familiar  virtual  particles,  such  as  virtual  electrons,  virtual
positrons, virtual quarks, etc. or even currently unknown species of virtual particles.

Recall that masseons carry both gravitational ‘mass charge’  and ordinary electrical charge.
However, the electrical interactions (photon exchanges) will work to equalize the fall rate
of virtual masseons  that  combine  to  make  virtual  particles  such  as  virtual  electrons  and
virtual quarks.  If a virtual quark consists of say 100 bound masseons (the actual number is
not known), the graviton exchanges would normally be cumulative. We would expect to
have  100  times  more  acceleration  imparted  to  the  virtual  quark,  compared  to  a  single
virtual masseon. However, virtual masseons dominate the quantum vacuum since they are
the fundamental mass particle, and do not have to bound with other  masseons  to  exist.
Therefore  the  lone,  unbound  virtual  masseon  is  by  far  the  most  common  virtual  mass
particle in the quantum vacuum (this is illustrated in figures 10).

No  matter  how  many  virtual  masseons  combine  to  give  other  virtual  particles  such  as
quarks,  the  local  electrical  interaction  between  the  far  more  numerous  lone  virtual
masseons and the virtual quark will tend to equalize the fall rate in exactly the same as we
discussed above for macroscopic masses. This process works like a microscopic version

40

of  the  EMQG  weak  principle  of  equivalence  for  the  wide  variety  of  falling  virtual
particles. In other words, the same action occurring on the particle level for large falling
masses is happening on the microscopic scale for elementary particles.

Figure  10  shows  the  microscopic  equivalence  principle  at  work  for  free  falling  virtual
particles  in  a  gravitational  field.  To  summarize,  the  electrical  forces  from  the  vastly
numerous, free virtual masseons of the quantum vacuum (which all fall at the same rate
due to equal mass charge) dominates over the action of the more familiar virtual particles
that  consist  of  combinations  of  virtual  masseons.  The  virtual  quark  would  normally  fall
faster  than  the  virtual  electron  and  the  virtual  electron  faster  than  an  individual  virtual
masseon if there were no quantum vacuum.

8.4

THE INERTION: AN ELEMENTARY QUANTA OF INERTIA

real  electrically  charged  masseon  particles,  which 

Recall that a real neutron particle with no net electrical charge has inertial mass because it
is  composed  of 
interact
electromagnetically  with  the  charged  virtual  masseon  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum
(recall  that  the  number  of  positive  and  negative  electrically  charged  masseons  inside  a
neutron are equal). Each real masseon inside the neutron contributes a fundamental unit or
‘quanta’  of  inertia  to  the  neutron,  because  of  the  electrical  force  interaction  with  the
immediate  surrounding  virtual  masseons  of  the  vacuum.  Therefore,  the  sum  of  the  real
masseon force contribution to the inertial mass of the neutron defines the neutron’s total
inertial mass.

We  propose  that  the  electrical  force  that  exists  between  one  real  masseon  particle
accelerating at a rate of 1g with respect to the surrounding quantum vacuum be given the
status of a new universal constant. We call this new constant the ‘inertion’  constant, or
“i”. The inertion has measurement units of force. Thus the  inertion represents the lowest
possible quanta of inertia force. In order to determine the numerical value of the  inertion
in the lab, one must determine the number of masseons inside a neutron for example, and
divide this into the observable (inertial) mass of the neutron. These numbers are currently
unknown at this time.

How does the background quantum vacuum look like from the frame of reference of the
neutron particle sitting on the surface of the earth? The answer is that it is the same as it
appears for a neutron on a rocket (1g). As we have found, the virtual  masseon and anti-
masseon particles of the quantum vacuum are accelerated by the direct graviton exchanges
with the earth. Therefore, we can conclude that the ‘inertion’  also represents the lowest
possible quanta of gravitational force on the earth.

8.5

EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE FOR THE SUN-EARTH-MOON SYSTEM

So far we only considered the weak equivalence principle for medium sized masses and
elementary particle. Does the weak equivalence principle hold for the following imaginary
scenario: the earth and the moon are simultaneously in free fall towards the sun with an
acceleration of gravity equal to ‘Gsun? In other words, would the earth and moon arrive at
the same time on the surface of the sun? Would they also arrive on the floor at the same
time when free falling inside a huge rocket undergoing acceleration Gsun in space (far from
any  other  large  masses)?  This  question  is  important  because  large  astronomical  bodies
have  their  own  internal  gravity,  and  are  able  to  significantly  disrupt  the  virtual  particles
around them. In other words, the earth’s gravity further modifies the acceleration vectors
of  the  virtual  particles  in  it’s  neighborhood,  and  adds  to  contribution  from  the  sun’s
gravity.

This question also turns out to be at the heart of the so-called metric theories of gravity. In
metric theories such as general relativity, all objects with any kind of internal composition
follow the natural curvature of space-time. This includes objects with considerable internal
energy sources and self-gravity. Any deviation from perfect equivalence would constitute
what is generally called the Nordtvedt effect (ref. 8), after the discoverer in 1968. Because
the earth’s core is molten and very hot, the earth contains a significant internal energy. The
earth  is  also  a  fairly  large  source  of  gravitational  energy  as  well,  which  significantly
contributes to the acceleration to the nearby virtual particles of the quantum vacuum in the
earth’s vicinity. Contrast this with the moon, which is relatively cool and less energetic,
with considerably less gravitational energy.

To see if the weak equivalence works, we start with the fantastic situation where the earth
and  moon  are  ‘dropped’  simultaneously  from  a  height  ‘h’  inside  a  huge  rocket  (with
negligible mass) accelerating with the same Gsun as exists on the surface of the sun (figure
12). The result of this experiment should be obvious. They both arrive on the floor of the
rocket at the same time. Actually, it is the floor of the rocket that accelerates upwards and
greets both bodies at the same time!

However,  one  should  be  aware  that  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  are
disturbed near these large bodies (by direct graviton exchanges between these bodies and
the nearby vacuum), particularly the acceleration vectors of the virtual particles which are
in  close  proximity  with  the  earth  and  the  moon.  The  vacuum  acceleration  vectors  now
tend to point towards the centers of the two bodies, near these regions. This, however,
does not affect the results of this experiment. The results are no different than if two small
masses are dropped inside the rocket; again because it is the floor that accelerates up to
meet them at the same time. However, one must note that the shape of the nearby virtual
particle distribution around the bodies in this case (figure 12).

Now we turn to another fantastic situation near the surface of the sun, where the earth and
moon are ‘dropped’  on the sun from the same height ‘h’  (figure 11). This situation is far
more complex than the same experiment inside the rocket. Now all three bodies disturb

42

the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum!  The  sun  sets  up  a  strong  GMsun/r2
acceleration field of virtual particles, which applies over very long distances, and points
towards  the  center  of  the  sun.  The  earth  and  moon  also  produce  their  own  vacuum
particle acceleration fields GMearth/r2 and GMmoon/r2 , respectively in their vicinity, although
much weaker over large distances. The sun’s acceleration dominates over the surrounding
space,  except  near  the  moon  and  near  the  earth;  where  some  of  the  virtual  particles
actually are moving away from the sun (as happens near the surface of the earth on the
night side).

How  can  equivalence  with  the  rocket  possibly  hold  in  this  scenario?  Recall  that  the
electrical action of the virtual particles of the vacuum on the real particles inside the bodies
that  determines  the  motion  of  the  earth  and  the  moon  undergoing  gravitational
acceleration.  However,  in  different  regions  of  the  earth,  the  virtual  particles  are
accelerating  in  different  directions!  Part  of  the  answer  to  this  problem  comes  from  an
important property exhibited by the  masseon-graviton particles, which is the principle of
superposition. This is a property that is also shared by the electron-photon particle. The
action of the gravitons originating from all three sources on a given virtual particle of the
quantum vacuum yields a net acceleration that is the net vector sum of the action of all the
gravitons received by that virtual particle.

To explain equivalence, we must first recall that equivalence only holds in a sufficiently
small region of space (technically, at a given point above the sun) when compared to the
equivalent accelerated reference frame. This is because the acceleration of the sun varies
with the distance ‘r’  from the sun’s center, whereas inside an accelerated rocket it does
not vary with height. Secondly, we must recall that the motion of the virtual particles in
the rocket is also disturbed near the vicinity of the earth and the moon. In fact, inside the
rocket the virtual particles are also directed along the radius vectors of both the earth and
the moon in their vicinity (figure 12). Yet we believe that the sun and the moon still reach
the floor of the rocket at the same time. Therefore, the quantum vacuum can be disturbed
in the case of the free fall of the earth and the moon in a rocket, and yet can still cause
both bodies to fall at the same rate in this case.

A close examination of figures 11 and 12 reveals that the quantum vacuum pattern is the
same for the two different experiments, when viewed from the correct reference frame. In
figure 11, the observer is stationed on the surface of the sun, so that we can see the reason
why both bodies are attracted to the sun. Recall that the electrical interaction between the
acceleration vectors of the falling virtual masseons and the real masseons in the earth and
moon is the primary reason for the attraction. The direct graviton action is negligible in
comparison.  Now  in  order  to  compare  the  two  experiments  of  figure  11  and  12,  the
reference frame for the sun experiment should be equivalent to the rocket.

In  the  rocket  experiment,  the  frame  chosen  for  our  observer  is  outside  the  rocket  (the
quantum  vacuum  has  a  relative  acceleration  of  zero)  in  order  to  understand  the  results.
Therefore  for  the  sun,  the  observer’s  frame  should  be  in  free  fall,  thus  restoring  the
relative acceleration of the quantum vacuum to zero just as for the observer outside the

43

rocket.    When  this  is  done,  we  have  to  correct  the  acceleration  vectors  of  the  virtual
particles near the earth and moon in figure 12. It is easy to show that the result of this
operation  gives  an  identical  result  as  figure  12.  Therefore,  equivalence  holds  in  both
experiments, because the vacuum acceleration patterns are the same!

Next  we  address  the  important,  and  more  complex  issue  of  light  motion  equivalence  in
accelerated and gravitational frames.

8.6

LIGHT MOTION IN A ROCKET: SPACE-TIME EFFECTS

According to general relativity, the strong equivalence principle demands that all physical
phenomena  are  equivalent  in  a  rocket  (1g)  and  on  the  earth,  for  a  sufficiently  small
volume.  This  includes  the  motion  of  light.  Furthermore,  there  ought  to  be  equivalent
curvature of 4D space-time.

We now review the Einstein famous thought experiment in regards to the motion of light
in accelerated and gravitational frames. First we carefully examine three scenarios for the
motion of light in a rocket (figures 6 and 7), which is accelerated upwards at 1 g (far from
any gravitational sources) and the same situation on the earth (figure 8 and 9). The 1 g
acceleration  is  purposely  chosen  to  match  the  earth’s  acceleration.  First  we  study  light
moving  from  the  floor  of  the  rocket  to  the  ceiling  where  it  is  detected  by  an  observer
there. Next we look at light moving from the ceiling of the rocket to the floor where it is
detected by an observer there. Finally, we examine more closely to what happens to light
moving parallel with the floor of the rocket (figure 14) and the same situation on the earth
(figure 13), where it follows a curved path.

(A) LIGHT MOVING FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING OF THE ROCKET

FIGURE  6  -  Here  the  light  is  positioned  on  the  floor  of  the  rocket  which  is  being
accelerating upwards at 1 g, and propagates in a straight line up to the observer on the
ceiling. Meanwhile, the rocket has accelerated upwards while the light is in flight. What
happens  to  the  light?  Experimentally,  we  observer  a  red  shift  in  the  color  of  the  light.
Furthermore, one can also conclude that there is a Doppler shift towards the red end of
the spectrum. This conclusion is based on to the motion of the observer on the ceiling,
who obtains an additional velocity over the light source during the time of flight of the
light, when velocities are compared to a third observer outside the rocket. What happens
to the velocity of light? To answer this, we must consider the nature of space and time,
since velocity is defined as distance/time..

According  to  general  relativity,  all  observers  measure  the  light  velocity  as  being  the
standard  vacuum  value,  where  each  use  their  measuring  instruments  that  are  identically
constructed, and calibrated inside each of their reference frame. In other words, the speed
of light does not vary under all these circumstances. Closer examination reveals that the

44

clocks in the ceiling differ from the clocks stationed on the floor. In particular, the clock
on the floor of the rocket runs slower than the one on the ceiling. Distances measurements
are also affected. General relativity explains all these observations with the 4D space-time
curvature  existing  inside  accelerated  frames.  We  will  return  to  this  example  with  our
EMQG interpretation of these measurements.

(B) LIGHT MOVING FROM THE CEILING TO THE FLOOR OF THE ROCKET

FIGURE 6 - Here the light is positioned on the ceiling of the rocket which is accelerating
upwards  at  1  g,  and  propagates  in  a  straight  line  down  to  the  observer  on  the  floor.
Meanwhile, the rocket has accelerated upwards while the light is in flight. What happens
to  the  light?  Experimentally,  we  observer  a  Doppler  blue  shift  in  the  color  of  the  light.
According  to  general  relativity,  all  observers  measure  the  light  velocity  as  being  the
standard  vacuum  value,  where  each  use  their  measuring  instruments  that  are  identically
constructed,  and  calibrated  inside  each  reference  frame.  Closer  examination  reveals  that
the  clocks  in  the  ceiling  differ  from  the  clocks  stationed  on  the  floor.  Distances
measurements are also affected. General relativity explains all these observations with the
4D space-time curvature existing inside accelerated frames. We will return to this example
with our EMQG interpretation of these measurements.

(C) LIGHT MOVING PARALLEL TO THE FLOOR OF THE ROCKET

FIGURE 7 - Here the light leaves the light source on the left wall of the rocket which is
accelerating upwards at 1 g, and propagates in a straight line towards the observer on the
right  wall.  Meanwhile,  the  rocket  has  accelerated  upwards  while  the  light  is  in  flight.
Therefore an observer in the rocket observes a curved light path. An observer outside the
rocket sees a straight light path. With the introduction of the third observer outside the
rocket, the reason for curvature becomes readily apparent. Outside the rocket the observer
sees  the  light  path  go  straight  across  the  rocket.  Meanwhile,  inside  the  rocket  the  light
leaves the source and is totally de-coupled from the source and moves straight (as seen
outside). However, the observer on the floor is drawn upwards by the accelerated motion
of the floor. This causes the inside observer to see a curved path.

According to general relativity, the space-time inside the rocket is curved (in the direction
of  motion),  and  light  moves  along  the  natural  geodesics  of  curved  4D  space-time.
Meanwhile,  the  observer  outside  the  rocket  lives  in  flat  4D  space-time,  and  therefore
observes  light  moving  in  a  perfect  straight  line,  which  is  the  geodesic  path  in  flat  4D
space-time.  We  will  return  to  this  example  with  our  EMQG  interpretation  of  these
measurements. Next we will examine the same scenarios for light motion on the surface of
the earth..

45

8.7

LIGHT MOTION NEAR EARTH’S SURFACE - SPACE-TIME EFFECTS

Now we carefully examine the same three scenarios for the motion of light, but now we
are on the surface of the earth. We will ignore the variation of acceleration with height
found on the earth, by selecting a room that is sufficiently low height and narrowness as to
ignore  the  slight  change  in  the  direction  of  acceleration  caused  by  acceleration  vectors
being directed along earth’s radius vectors. First, light moves from the floor of the room
on the surface of the earth to the ceiling, where it is detected. Next, light is moving from
the  ceiling  of  the  room  to  the  surface  of  the  earth  where  it  is  detected  by  an  observer.
Finally, light is moving parallel with the earth’s surface from the left side of the room to
the right, and follows a curved path.

(A) LIGHT MOVING FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING ON EARTH

FIGURE 8 - Light is positioned on the floor of a room on the surface of the earth, and
propagates in a straight line up to the observer on the ceiling. What happens to the light?
According to the principle of equivalence, the light behaves the same way as in the rocket,
i.e.  it  is  red-shifted.  However,  one  cannot  claim  a  Doppler  red  shift,  since  there  is  no
relative motion of the source and the detector according to general relativity. Is there any
other physical justification for the red shift, other the principle of equivalence? Since light
is  moving  through  a  gravitational  potential,  it  ought  to  lose  energy  as  it  gains  height.
According to E=hn
 decreases, and we
have  a  red  shift.  Therefore,  when  we  look  at  the  physics  behind  accelerated  and
gravitational frames for this situation (without resorting to the principle of equivalence),
we  find  two  different  explanations;  i.e.  Doppler  shift  and  gravitational  energy  loss.  In
EMQG, we find that the virtual particle dynamics alone gives an adequate explanation for
this.

, if the energy ‘E‘  goes down, then the frequency n

What happens to the velocity of light? To answer this, we must again consider the nature
of  space  and  time,  since  velocity  is  defined  as  distance/time.  According  to  general
relativity,  all  observers  measure  the  light  velocity  as  being  the  standard  vacuum  value,
where each use their measuring instruments that are identically constructed, and calibrated
inside  each  reference  frame.  In  other  words,  the  speed  of  light  does  not  vary  under  all
circumstances.  Closer  examination  reveals  that  the  clocks  in  the  ceiling  differ  from  the
clocks stationed on the floor. In particular, the clock on the floor on the earth runs slower
than  the  one  that  is  on  the  ceiling.  Distances  measurements  are  also  affected.  General
relativity explains all these observations with the 4D space-time curvature existing inside
accelerated frames. We will return to this example with our EMQG interpretation of these
measurements.

46

(B) LIGHT MOVING FROM THE CEILING TO THE FLOOR ON EARTH

FIGURE 8 - Here the light is positioned on the ceiling of the room on the surface of the
earth,  and  propagates  straight  down  to  the  observer  on  the  floor.  What  happens  to  the
light? Again to answer this, we must again consider the nature of space and time, since
velocity is defined as distance/time. According to general relativity, all observers measure
the light velocity as being the standard vacuum value, where each one uses their measuring
instruments that are identically constructed, and calibrated inside each reference frame. In
other words, the speed of light does not vary under all circumstances. Closer examination
reveals  that  the  clocks  in  the  ceiling  differ  from  the  clocks  stationed  on  the  floor.  In
particular, the clock on the floor on the earth runs slower than one that is on the ceiling.
Distances measurements are also affected. General relativity explains all these observations
with the 4D space-time curvature existing inside accelerated frames.

According to general relativity, an observer outside the room in free fall observes the light
moving downward at the speed of light in a straight path. Meanwhile, according to general
relativity,  an  observer  inside  the  room  stationed  on  the  floor  also  observes  the  light
moving downwards in a straight line. He also observes that the light is blue-shifted. He
makes  a  measurement  of  the  light  velocity  with  his  measuring  instruments  (which  were
calibrated within his reference frame) and observes that the velocity of light is the same on
the floor as he found when he measured received light speed in his internal reference frame
with the same instruments. In other words, the speed of light does not vary in all cases.
Closer  examination  reveals  that  clocks  measured  in  his  reference  frame  differ  from  the
clocks on the ceiling. In particular, the clock on the ceiling of the room runs faster than the
one  on  the  floor.  Distances  are  also  affected.  In  general  relativity,  all  these  conclusions
follow directly from 4D space-time curvature.

(C) LIGHT MOVING PARALLEL TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH

FIGURE  9  - Here the light leaves the light source on the left wall of the room on the
earth and propagates in a curved path towards the observer on the right wall. Meanwhile,
an observer in free fall towards the earth’s  surface  sees  light  moving  in  a  straight  path.
According to general relativity, and light moves along the natural geodesics of curved 4D
space-time in the room. Meanwhile, an observer in free fall lives in flat 4D space-time, and
hence  an  observer  sees  straight-line  paths  for  light.  In  general  relativity,  all  these
conclusions are identical as for the observer accelerated in the rocket at 1g in accordance
with  the  principle  of  equivalence.  Now  we  look  at  4D  space-time  curvature  from  the
perspective of EMQG.

8.8

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS FOR THE EQUIVALENCE OF LIGHT MOTION

The three elementary observables discussed above are:

47

(1)  The red-shift for light moving straight up in a rocket, or on the earth.
(2)  The blue-shift for light moving straight down in a rocket, or on the earth.
(3)  The curved light path when light moves parallel to the earth, or in a rocket.
 
One can easily conclude that there is a Doppler shift for light moving up or down in the
rocket,  because  the  detector  obtains  an  additional  velocity  with  respect  to  the  source
during the travel time of the photons (as seen by the observer outside the rocket).

It is also clear that one cannot conclude that a Doppler shift is responsible for the shift in
color of the light as it climbs or descends in the case of light motion in a gravitational
field. This conclusion is based on the fact that there is no relative motion between the light
source and the detector during the light travel time. The Doppler shift requires motion.

However, in general relativity the actual motion of the light is identical on the earth and
inside  the  accelerated  rocket.  It  does  not  say  anything  about  the  low  level,  quantum
processes responsible for the light, and why they give that same results! In other words,
general  relativity  prescribes  a  common  cause  for  the  light  motion  inside  the  accelerated
rocket on the earth; that is the curvature of space and time in both reference frames. We
maintain  that  the  actual  low  level  physical  causes  cannot  be  the  same,  however
because the physics at the quantum level are different for accelerated and gravitational
frames!  This  is  a  central  idea  in  EMQG,  where  there  actually  is  no  strong  equivalence
principle.  We    acknowledge  that  the  physical  details  of  the  low  level  processes  are
different, and we provide an explanation at the quantum scale in this section.

We can view the wave crests of light moving upwards against a gravitational field as a true
representation of the emitted history of the light wave. This is because the light crests are
conserved during propagation. No wave crests are created on route. Also, no wave crests
are lost during the motion of light. For each wave crest that enters the space between the
light  source  and  the  detector,  there  must  another  wave  crest  leaving  that  same  space.
Einstein himself gave a simple and elegant explanation of this in his 1911 paper.

The question to ask is why does an atom that emits a photon upwards in a gravitational
field  produce  a  photon  of  different  frequency  then  the  same  atom  in  far  empty  space?
Furthermore why does the atom in an accelerated rocket (1g) that emits light upwards,
produce the same frequency as the same atom in the earth’s gravitational field? Einstein’s
answer to these questions is to resort to the strong principle of equivalence and the metric
(although in 1911 he used the considerations of gravitational potential energy and arrived
at an answer that was off by a factor of two). The strong equivalence principle states that
time  is  slowed  in  the  same  way  in  the  rocket  and  on  the  earth,  thus  slowing  all  atomic
processes (without recourse to lower level quantum phenomena).

EMQG  provides  a  simple  answer  to  these  questions.  The  accelerated  state  of  the
electrically charged quantum vacuum appears the same from the perspective of both
the atom in a rocket and an atom on the earth that emits photons. That is, the vacuum
background  conditions  for  the  atom  in  an  accelerated  rocket  (1g)  that  emits  photons

48

upwards  is  identical  to  the  same  vacuum  background  for  the  same  atom  that  is  on  the
earth’s  surface  (neglecting  the  graviton  background  for  the  case  of  the  earth)!
Furthermore, the electrically charged virtual particles affect the motion of photons. We
will  elaborate  on  this  after  reviewing  photon  scattering  theory,  and  the  effects  of
accelerated electrical charges on the propagation of light.

We  would  like  to  point  out  an  important  problem  with  the  standard  general  relativistic
interpretation of the blue shift of light (when light travels straight down on the surface of
the earth) that has recently been pointed out to us by V. Petkov (ref. 47, 1999). In this
scenario,  light  propagates  downwards  from  the  ceiling  to  the  floor  of  the  gravitational
field and light becomes blue-shifted rather than red-shifted (figure 6). Why is this so?

V.  Petkov  makes  a  strong  case  for  what  he  calls  the  anisotropic  light  velocity  in  non-
inertial frames. He argues that the proper velocity of light changes in a gravitational field.
Light  moves  faster  when  propagates  downwards,  and  light  moves  slower  when  it
propagates upwards compared to the vacuum value. The proper light velocity is defined
by the proper length and proper time measurements. It turns out that Petkov’s approach is
very similar to the approach we adopted in EQMG, which we now examine fully in the
next section (with the exception of a difference in opinion on the nature of the 4D space-
time).

THE EQUIVALENCE OF 4D SPACE-TIME CURVATURE

Here we will contrast the two very different approaches to the problem of 4D space-time
curvature, and the equivalence of 4D space-time in accelerated and gravitational frames:

General Relativity: Light velocity is constant, and we have 4D space-time curvature.
EMQG&Scattering: Photons scatter with the electrically charged falling vacuum.

The central theme in general relativity is the constancy of light velocity. The curvature of
4D space-time is the root cause of all the observable aspects of light motion in the rocket
and on the earth. A deflected light path in a gravitational field would seem to violate the
constancy of light velocity, but it is the curving of 4D space-time that is the culprit.

The  central  theme  in  EMQG  is  that  photons  scatter  with  the  electrically  charged,  and
falling (accelerated) virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. Photon scattering accounts
for the illusion of 4D space-time curvature! Furthermore, matter also reacts to the falling
vacuum, and together a 4D space-time curvature phenomena emerges from the low level
activities of quantum particles on a kind of absolute space and time background (the CA).

We have already presented a unified picture of the equivalence of real matter motion in an
accelerated  rocket  and  on  the  earth,  with  the  model  of  the  falling  electrically  charged
quantum vacuum. We now wish to extend this model to cover the motion of light under

49

the action of the falling vacuum in an  accelerated frame and on the surface of the earth,
which we claim encompasses the relativistic standard model of 4D space and time.

First we will derive the gravitational time dilation equation in the conventional way, using
the  general  relativistic  solution  to  Einstein’s  gravitational  field  equations  for  a  large
spherical, non-rotating mass. This solution is called the Schwarzschild  metric.  Next,  we
fully  develop  the  EQMG  theory  of  light  scattering  and  4D  space-time  curvature.  From
this, we calculate the quantity of space-time curvature using EMQG theory, and show that
the results are the same as relativity for spherical masses. In EMQG the light velocity is
anisotropic as Petkov has suggested, but the changes in light velocity (compared to the
vacuum value) occur not in proper units of length and time (Petkov, ref. 47), but in the
CA absolute units of cells and clock cycles. For this work, we will not go into the details
of the absolute CA space and time, and reference 1 gives a complete account.

GENERAL RELATIVISTIC 4D SPACE-TIME CURVATURE

It  is  well  known  that  general  relativity  accounts  for  the  motion  of  light  near  a  large
spherical  mass,  using  the  concept  of  4D  space-time  curvature.  General  Relativity
postulates space-time curvature in order to preserve the constancy of the light velocity (a
notion  first  introduced  in  special  relativity)  in  an  accelerated  frame  or  in  a  gravitational
field. The 4D space-time metric must satisfy Einstein’s Gravitational field equations:

This is a complete mathematical description of the 4D space-time curvature near the large
spherical  mass  in  spherical  coordinates  in  differential  form  called  the  4D  space-time
metric. It is of the form of the element of distance ‘ds’  between two closely spaced points
expressed  in  terms  of  the  chosen  coordinates,  where  ds2  =  gik(x)  dxi  dxk,  and  the  time
coordinate  is  g00.  From  this,  it  is  easy  to  show  (ref.  39)  that  the  comparison  of  time
measurements between a clock outside a gravitational field (called proper time t( ¥
 ) to a
clock at distance r from the center of a spherical mass distribution (called the coordinate
time t( r ) is given by:

This gives the amount of time dilation between a clock on the earth “t( r )”  compared to a
clock positioned at infinity “t( ¥
 )”. From this, we see that clocks on the earth run slower
then  at  infinity.  The  deeper  a  clock  is  in  a  gravitational  potential  the  slower  it  runs,  as
compared to it’s identically constructed cousin at infinity. So does the frequency of light
that is emitted from an atom on the earth.

Similarly, from this metric, we find that the distance D r at point s( r ) compared to the
same distance D r at infinity follows as:

This  gives  the  amount  of  space  distortion  for  a  ruler  of  length  D r  on  the  earth  “s(  r  )”
compared to the identically constructed ruler of length D r positioned at infinity “s( ¥

 )”.

Observationally, equation 9.13 has been verified experimentally by atomic clocks mounted
on board an airplane (ref. 6 and 7). In these experiments, an atomic clock had spent many
hours at a high altitude inside and was returned to the ground and compared to an atomic
clock  in  the  laboratory.  After  correcting  for  various  background  effects,  the  laboratory
clock lagged behind the airplanes atomic clock by the predicted amount.

EMQG, LIGHT MOTION, AND 4D SPACE-TIME CURVATURE

The general principles of EMQG are applied here in order to understand 4D space-time
curvature and the principle of equivalence of all light motion in an accelerated rocket (1g)

on  the  surface  of  the  earth.  To  do  this  we  must  examine  in  detail  the  effects  of  the
background electrically charged, and falling, virtual particles of the quantum vacuum on
the propagation of light.  The big question to consider is:

Is  the  general  downward  acceleration  of  the  electrically  virtual  particles  of  the
quantum  vacuum  near  a  large  mass  responsible  for  the  motion  of  photons  in  a
gravitational  field,  or  is  this  motion  truly  the  result  of  an  actual  4D  space-time
geometric curvature that exists near the earth (and which holds to the absolute tiniest
distance scales)?

The  answer  to  this  very  important  question  hinges  on  whether  our  universe  is  truly  a
curved,  geometric  Minkowski  4D  space-time  on  the  smallest  of  distance  scales,  or
whether curved 4D space-time results merely from the activities of quantum particles such
as bosons and fermions (living in an absolute CA space and time) interacting with other
virtual  quantum  particles  in  the  background  quantum  vacuum.  EMQG  takes  the  second
approach,  in  order  to  be  compatible  with  quantum  inertia  and  CA  theory.  The  second
approach also leads to an in- depth understanding of the principle of equivalence on the
quantum scale.

According to EMQG theory, light takes on the same general acceleration component as
the net statistical average value of the falling, electrically charged, virtual particles of the
quantum vacuum, through an electrical ‘Fizeau-like’  scattering process. By this we mean
that the photons are frequently absorbed and re-emitted by the electrically charged virtual
particles,  which  are  (on  the  average)  accelerating  towards  the  center  of  the  large  mass.
When a virtual particle absorbs the real photon, a new photon is re-emitted after a small
time delay in the same average downward direction that the original photon takes. This
process is called photon scattering. Photon scattering is well understood for real matter,
and the effects of scattering on light velocity are also well known in field of optics. We
will see that photon scattering in an accelerated quantum vacuum (where the vacuum can
be  considered  as  a  fluid  medium)  is  also  central  to  the  understanding  of  4D  space-time
curvature.

One of the most important (and completely undisputed) results of classical optics is that
light  moves  slower  in  water  than  it  does  in  air.  Furthermore  it  is  recognized  that  the
velocity  of  light  in  air  is  slower  than  that  of  light’s  vacuum  velocity.  This  effect  is
described by the index of refraction ‘n’, which is defined as the ratio of light velocities in
the two different media. What is also an interesting result from classical physics is that the
velocity of light in an ordinary transparent and moving medium (such as moving water)
is known to differ from its value in the same stationary medium (such as stationary water).
Fizeau (1851) is credited for demonstrated this experimentally in the laboratory with light
propagating through pipes containing currents of water, flowing with a constant velocity
in two opposite directions.

In 1915 Lorentz identified the physics of this phenomena as being due to his microscopic
semi-classical electromagnetic theory of photon propagation. Einstein was also aware of

52

these  results  and  attributed  this  to  the  special  relativistic  velocity  addition  rule  for  the
addition of the light and water velocities, without consideration of the low level quantum
processes involved.

In EMQG, we propose that in gravitational fields (and for accelerated motion) the moving
water of Fizeau’s experiment is now replaced by the accelerated and electrically charged
virtual  particle  flow  of  the  quantum  vacuum.  Like  in  the  Fizeau  experiment,  photons
scatter with the accelerated virtual particles of the quantum vacuum and vary their motion.

Imagine what would happen if you place a clock inside a stream of moving water in the
Fizeau experiment. Would the clock keep time properly, when compared to an identically
constructed clock placed in stationary water. Of course not! The very idea of this seems
almost ridiculous. Of course one could argue that the nature of the hydrodynamic forces in
moving  and  stationary  water  would  alter  the  dynamics  of  how  the  clock  operates.  We
suggest that you should also not be surprised to find that the accelerated flow of virtual
particles affects both clocks and rulers placed in a gravitational field, as compared to the
identical measuring instruments in far space where the vacuum is undisturbed.

Another important result from EMQG and scattering theory is that the velocity of light in
a vacuum, without the existence of any virtual particles of the quantum vacuum, should be
much  greater  than  the  observed  average  light  velocity  in  the  vacuum.  The  electrically
charged virtual fermion particles of the quantum vacuum frequently scatter photons, which
introduce many tiny delays for the photon propagation. This causes a great reduction in
the total average light velocity in the vacuum that is populated by countless numbers of
virtual,  electrically  charged,  particles.  In  other  words;  the  low  level  light  velocity
(between virtual particle scattering events) is much greater than the measured average
light velocity after vacuum scattering in the normal vacuum. A similar effect is known
to occur when light propagates through glass, where photons scatter with electrons in the
glass  molecules,  which  subsequently  reduces  the  average  light  velocity  through  glass
compared  to  the  normal  vacuum  light  velocity.  This  result  is  frequently  overlooked  by
physicists.

In our study of special relativity, we have seen the importance of the propagation of light
in  understanding  the  nature  of  space  and  time  measurements.  Recall  that  according  to
standard  text  books  (for  example,  Serway  ref.  19)  the  definition  of  an  inertial  frame  in
space is a vast rigid 3D grid of identically constructed clocks placed at regular intervals
with a ruler (figure 20). These clocks are viewed by an observer with ordinary light, i.e.
one can simply ‘look’  at a clock and determine the time. Since light has a finite speed, we
are forced to conclude in this scheme of things that two clocks cannot be simultaneous! If
light is somehow affected by gravitational fields, this is bound to distort this concept of
space and time, using the above definition of an inertial frame. Therefore, we will closely
examine the behavior of light near the earth and in an accelerated rocket.

We must remind the readers that the constancy of light velocity in gravitational frames still
remains a postulate of general relativity, in spite of 90 years of close scrutiny. General

53

relativity incorporates all the results of special relativity, including the second postulate of
light constancy for all inertial observers. In other words, it is impossible experimentally to
distinguish  between  whether  the  light  velocity  changes  when  light  moves  upwards,  or
whether 4D space-time changes with height. What is lacking is a standard to gauge these
alternatives.  In  other  words,  what  measurement  standard  is  assumed  in  discussions
regarding  the  rates  of  clocks,  the  lengths  of  rulers,  and  the  speed  of  light.  The
measurements of local observers cannot be used to answer this question, because we are
considering  changes  to  the  actual  measurement  standards  that  are  used  by  different
observers!

First we must carefully understand what is meant by light velocity. Velocity is  defined as
distance  divided  by  time,  or  c=d/t.  Light  has  very  few  observable  characteristics  in  this
regard: we can measure velocity c (the ratio of d/t); frequency n ; wavelength l
; and we
can also measure velocity by the relationship c=n
. It is important to note that all these
observables  are  closely  interrelated.  We  know  that  n
  =  1/t  (t  is  the  period  of  one  light
cycle)  and  l =d  (the  length  of  one  light  cycle).  Thus,  c=d/t  and  c=n
  are  equivalent
expressions of space and time. If we transmit green light to an observer on the ceiling of a
room on the earth, and he claims that the light is red shifted, it is impossible for him to tell
if the red shift was caused by the light velocity changing, or by space and time distortions
which causes the timing and length of each of the light cycles to change.

This is very important, and we illustrate this with an example. Imagine that the frequency
of light is halved, or n
i , and that you were
not aware of both of these changes. Then you would conclude that the velocity of light
remains unchanged (c=n
l ). However, if the velocity of light is halved, and you were not
aware of it, then you could conclude that the frequency is halved, n
i  and  the
wavelength doubles l

i and the wavelength doubles l

f =  (1/2)  n

f  = 2l

f = (1/2) n

f  = 2l

i.

To  illustrate  this  point,  we  will  now  examine  what  happens  if  an  observer  on  the  floor
feeds a ladder (which represents the wave character of light) with equally spaced rungs to
an observer on the ceiling, where each observer cannot see what the other observer does
with the ladder. A ladder is used as an analogy for the wave characteristic of light, where
the distance between rungs represent the wavelength of light (figure 15).

Imagine a perfect ladder with equally space rungs of known length being passed up to you
at a known velocity (figure 15), such that it is impossible to tell the motion of the ladder
other than by observing the rungs moving past you. If the rung spacing are made larger,
you  would  conclude  that  either  the  ladder  is  slowing  down,  or  that  the  spacing  of  the
ladder  rungs  was  increased.  But  it  would  be  impossible  to  tell  which  is  which.  Let  us
assume that you make a measurement on the moving rungs, and observe a spacing of 1
meter  between  any  two  rungs.  Then  you  observe  that  two  rungs  move  past  you  every
second. You therefore conclude the velocity of the ladder is 2 m/sec.

Now suppose that the ladder is fed to you at half speed or at 1 m/sec, and that you are not
aware of this change in velocity. You could conclude that the velocity halved from your

54

l
l
measurements, because you now observe that one rung appears in view for every second
that  elapses  instead  of  two  rungs,  and  that  the  velocity  was  thus  reduced  to  1  m/sec.
However, you could just as well concluded that your space and time was altered, and that
the velocity of the ladder is constant or unaffected. Since you observe only one rung in
view per second instead of the usual two rungs, you could claim that the rung spacing on
the  ladder  is  enlarged  (red-shifted)  or  doubled  to  2  m  by  distortions  of  your  measuring
equipment, and that the velocity still remained unaltered. From this, you might conclude
that  the  frequency  is  halved,  and  that  time  measurements  that  might  be  based  on  this
ladder are now dilated by a factor of two.

Which of these two approaches to the ladder problem is truly correct? It is impossible to
say  by  measurement,  unless  you  know  before  hand  what  trait  of  the  ladder  was  truly
altered. For photons, the same problem exists. No known measurement of photons in an
accelerated  rocket  or  on  the  surface  of  the  earth  can  reveal  whether  space  and  time  is
affected, or whether the velocity of light has changed. This is why the constancy of light
remains a postulate in general relativity.

In  EMQG  theory,  the  variable  light  velocity  approach  is  chosen  for  several  important
reasons. First, the equivalence of light motion in accelerated and gravitational frames
now  becomes  fully  understood  as  a  dynamic  process  having  to  do  with  motion  rather
then a fundamental principle of physics. For gravity, it is the hidden virtual particle motion,
and  for  accelerated  frames  it  is  the  motion  of  the  frame  itself.  Furthermore,  this  model
retains the same basic behavior as for ordinary matter in motion in accelerated frames and
gravitational  frames.  The  equivalence  principle  now  becomes  understood  on  a  quantum
scale for both light and matter, using the same background vacuum concept.

Secondly, the physical basis of the curvature of Minkowski 4D space-time near a large
mass  now  becomes  clear.  It  arises  from  the  interaction  of  light  and  matter  with  the
background  accelerated  virtual  particle  processes.  This  process  can  be  visualized  as  an
accelerated quantum vacuum fluid flow in both frames types. However, in gravitation the
vacuum fluid flow is caused by direct graviton exchanges acting between the earth and the
electrically charged, virtual fermions of the quantum vacuum. In accelerated frames, the
vacuum  fluid  flow  is  apparent  and  caused  by  the  actual  acceleration  of  the  observer’s
frame and his light sources (and the measuring instruments he possesses).

Finally, and most importantly,  the  mysterious  physical  action  that  occurs  between  the
earth  and  the  surrounding  4D  space-time  curvature  now  becomes  very  clearly
understood.  The  earth  acts  on  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  through
graviton exchanges, causing them to accelerate towards the earth. The accelerated virtual
particles in turn act on light and matter to produce the effects of curved 4D space-time.

Since photon scattering is essential to our understanding of the details of 4D space-time
curvature, we will examine scattering in some detail in the following sections. Readers that
are familiar with photon scattering theory may wish to skip ahead to section 9.9. First we
review the conventional physics of light scattering in a real media such as water or glass,

55

introducing the concept of the index of refraction and Snell’s Law of refraction. Next we
introduce  photon  scattering  for  a  real  media  moving  at  a  constant  velocity,  where  the
velocity  of  light  varies  in  the  moving  media  (known  as  the  Fizeau  effect).  Next  we
introduce an accelerated motion for the real medium and examine how the photons scatter
there.  This  is  an  important  step  towards  understanding  EMQG  theory.  Finally  we
generalize  these  arguments  to  examine  photon  scattering  with  the  electrically  charged
virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. In the next sub-section we show the relationship
between photon scattering and 4D space-time curvature.

9.3

CLASSICAL SCATTERING OF PHOTONS IN REAL MATTER

It is a well-known result of classical optics that light moves slower in glass than in air. This
effect is described by the index of refraction ‘n’, which is the ratio of light velocities in the
two different media. The Feynman Lectures on Physics gives one of the best accounts of
the classical theory for the origin of the refractive index and the slowing of light through a
transparent material like glass (ref. 42, chap. 31).

When light passes from a vacuum into glass, with an incident angle of q 0 it deflects and
changes it’s direction and moves at a new angle q 1 , where the angles follow Snell’s law:

n = sin q 0 / sin q 1 

          (9.31)

This follows geometrically because the wave crests on both sides of the surface of the
glass must have the same spacing, since they must travel together (ref. 42). The shortest
distance between crests of the wave is the wavelength divided by the frequency. On the
vacuum side of the glass surface it is l 0 = 2p c/w
 =
2p v/w
geometrically (ref. 42). In some sense, the existence of the index of refraction in Snell’s
law is confirmation of the change in light speed going from the vacuum to glass.

, and on the other side it is given by l
 or 2p c / w n since we define v=c/n. If we accept this, then Snell’s law follows

Snell’s law does not tell us why we have a change in light velocity, nor does it give us any
insight into the phenomena of dispersion and back scattering of light in refraction. A good
classical account of the derivation of the index of refraction is given by Feynman himself in
ref. 42. Feynman  derives  the  index  of  refraction  for  a  transparent  medium  by  accepting
that the total electric field in any physical circumstance can be represented by the sum of
the fields from all charge sources, and by accepting that the field from a single charge is
given by it’s acceleration evaluated with a retardation speed ‘c’  (the propagation speed of
the exchanged photons). We only summarize the important points of his argument below,
and the full details are available in reference 42:

(1) The  incoming  source  electromagnetic  wave  (light)  consists  of  an  oscillating  electric
and magnetic field. The glass consists of electrons bound elastically to the atoms, such
that if a force is applied to an electron the displacement from its normal position will
be proportional to the force.

56

(2) The  oscillating  electric  field  of  the  light  causes  the  electron  to  be  driven  in  an
oscillating motion, thus acting like a new radiator generating a new electromagnetic
wave. This new wave is always delayed, or retarded in phase. These delays result from
the time delay required for the bound electron to oscillate to full amplitude. Recall that
the  electron  carries  mass  and  therefore  inertia.  Therefore  some  time  is  required  to
move the electron.

(3) The  total  resulting  electromagnetic  wave  is  the  sum  of  the  source  electromagnetic
wave  plus  the  new  phase-delayed  electromagnetic  wave,  where  the  total  resulting
wave is phase-shifted.

(4) The resulting phase delay of the electromagnetic wave is the root cause of the reduced

velocity of light observed in the medium.

Feynman goes on to derive the classic formula for the index of refraction for atoms with
several different resonant frequency w k which is given by:

where n is the index of refraction, qe is the electron charge, m is the electron mass, w
 is the
incoming light frequency, g k is the damping factor, and Nk is the number of atoms per unit
volume.  This  formula  describes  the  index  of  refraction  for  many  substances,  and  also
describes the dispersion of light through the medium. Dispersion is the phenomenon where
the index of refraction of a media varies with the frequency of the incoming light, and is
the  reason  that  a  glass  prism  bends  light  more  in  the  blue  end  than  the  red  end  of  the
spectrum.

If the medium consists of free, unbound electrons in the form of a gas such as in a plasma
(or  as  the  conduction  electrons  in  a  simple  metal)  then  the  index  of  refraction  with  the
conditions g k <<  w

 QUANTUM FIELD THEORY OF PHOTON SCATTERING IN MATTER

the correct account must be a quantum mechanical account.

To quote R. Feynman:  “  …  yes, but the world is quantum not classical dam-it”.

The propagation of light through a transparent medium is a very difficult subject in QED.
It is impossible to compute the interaction of a collection of atoms with light exactly. In
fact,  it  is  impossible  to  treat  even  one  atom’s  interaction  with  light  exactly  in  QED.
However the interaction of a real atom with photons can be approximated by a simpler
quantum system. Since in many cases only two atomic energy levels play a significant role
in the interaction of the electromagnetic field with atoms, the atom can be represented by a
quantum system with only two energy eigenstates.

In the text book “Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics”  a thorough treatment of the
absorption  and  emission  of  photons  in  two-level  atoms  is  given  (ref.  43,  Chap.  15,  pg.
762).  When  a  photon  is  absorbed,  and  later  a  new  photon  of  the  same  frequency  is  re-
emitted by an electron bound to an atom, there exists a time delay before the photon re-
emission. The probabilities for emission and absorption of a photon is given as a function
of time D

t for an atom frequency of w 0 and photon frequency of w 1 :

Probability of Photon Absorption is:    K  [ sin (0.5(w 1 - w 0) D
Probability of Photon Emission  is:      M  [ sin (0.5(w 1 - w 0) D

(where K and M are complex expressions defined in ref. 43)

t)  / ( 0.5(w 1 - w 0)) ]2
t)  / ( 0.5(w 1 - w 0)) ]2

            (9.41)

The important point we want to make from eq. 16.41 is that the probability of absorption
or  emission  depends  on  the  length  of  time  D
t,  where  the  probability  of  the  emission  is
zero, if the time D
t = 0. In other words according to QED, a finite time is required before
re-emission of the photon. There are other factors that affect the probability, of course.
For  example,  the  closer  the  frequency  of  the  photon  matches  the  atomic  frequency,  the
higher the probability of re-emission in some given time period. We maintain that these
delays are the actual route cause of the index of refraction in a medium.

We  believe  that  a  similar  thing  happens  when  photons  propagate  through  the  quantum
vacuum. Therefore, we want to address the effect of the virtual particles of the quantum
vacuum on the propagation velocity of real (non-virtual) photons, a subject that is largely
ignored in the physics literature.

THE SCATTERING OF PHOTONS IN THE QUANTUM VACUUM

In  section  9.3  we  discussed  photon  scattering  in  a  real  matter  medium  and  in  a  real
negatively  charged  electron  gas.  The  electron  gas  model  is  the  closest  model  we  have
towards  understanding  photon  scattering  of  the  quantum  vacuum.  However,  there  are
several  important  differences  between  the  charged  electron  gas  medium  and  the
electrically charged virtual fermion particles of the quantum vacuum as a medium.

58

First, and most importantly, virtual particles do not carry any net average energy. Instead
an  individual  virtual  particle  ‘borrows’  a  small  amount  of  energy  during  it’s  brief
existence, which is then paid back quickly in accordance to the uncertainty principle. It is
because  quantum  mechanics  forbids  knowing  the  value  of  two  complementary  variables
precisely (in this case energy and existence time) for a virtual particle that virtual particles
are allowed to exist at all. Therefore unlike the electron gas, the vacuum is incapable of
permanently absorbing light that propagates through it.

Thus  the  quantum  vacuum  does  not  absorb  any  light  over  macroscopic  distance  scales.
This  statement  seems  trivial,  but  it  is  never-the-less  important  when  considering  the
quantum vacuum as a medium. On microscopic scales real photons are absorbed and re-
emitted by individual virtual particles, in accordance with QED. Photon energy is lost in
some collisions and regained in others so that on the average the energy loss is zero. This
is because during the brief existence time of a virtual fermion particle, the virtual particle
does  possess  energy,  which  is  paid  back  almost  immediately.  This  quantum  process
happens  an  enormous  number  of  times  as  light  travels  through  macroscopic  distance
scales. The energy balances out to zero over sufficiently large distance scales.

Furthermore unlike the electron gas, there can be no dispersion of light in the quantum
vacuum.  In  other  words  all  frequencies  of  electromagnetic  radiation  move  at  the  same
speed  through the quantum vacuum in spite of the incredible numbers of virtual particle
interactions  that  occur  for  any  particular  frequency  of  photon.  Zero  dispersion  follows
experimentally from many astronomical observations of distant supernova, where there is
a  dramatic  change  in  light  and  electromagnetic  radiation  with  time.  Observations  have
been made of specific events in the light curves of supernovae light curves that range from
the  radio  band  frequencies  to  the  X-ray  /  Gamma  Ray  frequencies.  All  the  different
frequencies are observed to arrive on the earth at the same time.

With distances of thousands or millions of light years away, any discrepancy in the photon
velocity of supernovae at different frequencies would be very apparent. For example with
the relatively nearby supernova 1987A (which exploded about 160,000 years ago in the
Large Magellanic  cloud)  all  the  different  frequencies  of  EM  waves  has  reached  us  very
much at the same time. If there had been a dispersion of only 0.01 m/sec in light velocity
(i.e. 3 parts in 10-11) between two different frequencies, then the light of one frequency
would arrive on the earth:

160000 x 365.25 x 24 x 60 x 60 x 10-2 / (3x10-8) =170 seconds or 2.8 minutes later!

A  result  like  this  obviously  disagrees  with  observations  made  of  the  spectrum  of
supernova  1987A.  Spectra  have  been  obtained  for  very  distant  supernovae  up  to  a  few
billion  light  years  away  in  other  galaxies.  One  study  places  the  maximum  allowed
dispersion  to  be  on  the  order  of  1  part  in  10-21.  Thus  we  conclude  that  there  is  no
dispersion of light in the vacuum.

59

Is there a possibility for an index of refraction in the vacuum, as we have in an electron
gas?  Remember  that  an  index  of  refraction  requires  two  different  media  in  which  to
compare the relative velocities of light. However the vacuum particle density must nearly
uniform, with no transitions in density. Let us imagine a situation where somehow we have
removed all the virtual particles in half of an empty box in vacuum, and the other half has
the  normal  population  of  virtual  particles  in  the  normal  quantum  vacuum  state.  Would
there be an index of refraction as light traveled from one side of the box to the other?

This  is  a  very  important  question  because  the  validity  of  special  relativity  at  the  sub-
microscopic distance scales comes into question here. You might think that if the vacuum
has no energy, there should no effect on the propagation speed of photons. However we
believe that the virtual particles in the quantum vacuum do indeed delay the progress of
photons through electrically charged vacuum particle scattering effects. Thus we believe
that  photon  scattering  reduces  the  light  velocity  on  the  half  of  the  box  with  electrically
charged virtual particles. How can we justify this belief, in spite of the contradiction to
special  relativity?  Special  relativity  is  a  classical  theory,  and  was  developed  in  the
macroscopic domain of physics. It is almost impossible to measure light velocities over the
extremely short distance scales that we are talking about.

t, which satisfies the uncertainty principle: D E D

The electrically charged virtual particles in the quantum vacuum all have random velocities
and move in random directions. They also have random energies D E during their brief life
time D
t > h/(2p ). Imagine a real photon
propagating in a straight path through the electrically charged virtual particles in a given
direction.  The  real  photon  will  encounter  an  equal  number  of  virtual  particles  moving
towards it as it does moving away from it. The end result is that the electrically charged
quantum vacuum particles do not contribute anything different than the situation where all
the virtual particles in the it’s path were at relative rest. Thus we can consider the vacuum
as  some  sort  of  stationary  crystal  medium  of  virtual  particles  with  a  very  high  density,
where each virtual particle is short-lived and constantly replaced (and carry no net average
energy as discussed above).

The  progress  of  the  real  photon  is  delayed  as  it  travels  through  this  quantum  vacuum
‘crystal’,  where  it  meets  uncountable  numbers  of  electrically  charged  virtual  particles.
Light  travels  through  this  with  no  absorption  or  dispersion.  Based  on  our  general
arguments  above,  we  postulate  that  the  photon  is  delayed  as  it  travels  through  the
quantum vacuum. We can definitely say that the uncertainty principle places a lower limit
on the emission and absorption time delay, and forbids the time delay from being  exactly
equal to zero.

Therefore  we  conclude  that  the  electrically  charged  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum
vacuum frequently absorb and re-emit the real photons moving through the vacuum
by  introducing  small  delays  during  absorption  and  subsequent  re-emission  of  the
photon,  thus  reducing  the  average  propagation  speed  of  the  photons  in  the  vacuum
(compared to the light speed of photons between absorption/re-emission events).

60

Our  examination  of  the  physics  literature  has  not  revealed  any  previous  work  on  a
quantum  time  delay  analysis  of  photon  propagation  through  the  quantum  vacuum,
presumably because of the precedent set by Einstein’s postulate of light speed constancy in
the  vacuum  under  all  circumstances.  We  will  take  the  position  that  the  delays  due  to
photon  scattering  through  the  quantum  vacuum  are  real.  These  delays  reduce  the  much
faster  and  absolutely  fixed  ‘low-level  light  velocity cl’  (defined  as  the  photon  velocity
between vacuum particle scattering events) to the average observed light velocity ‘c’  in
the vacuum (300,000 km/sec) that we observe in our actual experiments.

Furthermore, we propose that the quantum vacuum introduces a sort of Vacuum Index of
Refraction ‘nvac’  (compared to a vacuum without all virtual particles) such that c = cl / nvac.
If this is true, what is the low-level light velocity? It is unknown at this time, but it must be
significantly  larger  than  300,000  km/sec.  In  fact  we  believe  that  the  vacuum  index  of
refraction ‘nvac’ must be very large because of the high density of virtual particles in the
vacuum.  This  concept  is  required  in  EMQG  theory,  and  has  become  central  to
understanding the equivalence principle and 4D space-time curvature in accelerated frames
and in gravitational fields.

9.6

THE FIZEAU EFFECT:  LIGHT VELOCITY IN A MOVING MEDIA

It also has been known for over a century that the velocity of light in a moving medium
differs  from  its  value  in  the  same  stationary  medium.  Fizeau  demonstrated  this
experimentally  in  1851  (ref.  41).  For  example,  with  a  current  of  water  (with  refractive
index of the medium of n=4/3) flowing with a velocity V of about 5 m/sec, the relative
variation in the light velocity is 10-8 (which he measured by use of interferometry). Fresnel
first derived the formula (ref. 41) in 1810 with his ether dragging theory. The resulting
formula  relates  the  longitudinal  light  velocity  ‘vc’  moving  in  the  same  direction  as  a
transparent medium of an index of refraction ‘n’  defined such that ‘c/n’  is the light velocity
in  the  stationary  medium,  which  is  moving  with  velocity  ‘V’  (with  respect  to  the
laboratory frame), where c is the velocity of light in the vacuum:

Fresnel Formula:   vc = c/n  +  (1 – 1/n2) V 

            (9.61)

Why does the velocity of light vary in a moving (and non-moving) transparent medium?
According to the principles of special relativity, the velocity of light is a constant in the
vacuum with respect to all inertial observers. When Einstein proposed this postulate, he
was not aware that the vacuum is not empty. However he was aware of Fresnel’s formula
and derived it by the special relativistic velocity addition formula for parallel velocities (to
first  order).  According  to  special  relativity,  the  velocity  of  light  relative  to  the  proper
frame of the transparent medium depends only on the medium. The velocity of light in the
stationary medium is defined as ‘c/n’. Recall that velocities u and v add according to the
formula:  (u + v) / (1 + uv/c2)
Therefore:

61

vc = [ c/n + V ] / [ 1 + (c/n) (V)/c2 ]   =  (c/n + V) / ( 1 + V/(nc) )  »

  c/n + (1 – 1/n2) V

           (9.62)

The special relativistic approach to deriving the Fresnel formula does not say much about
the actual quantum processes going on at the atomic level. At this scale, there are several
explanations  for  the  detailed  scattering  process  in  conventional  physics.  We  investigate
these different approaches in more detail below.

9.7

 LORENTZ SEMI-CLASSICAL PHOTON SCATTERING

The  microscopic  theory  of  the  light  propagation  in  matter  was  developed  as  a
consequence of  Lorentz’s non-relativistic, semi-classical electromagnetic theory. We will
review and summarize this approach to photon scattering, which will not only prove useful
for  our  analysis  of  the  Fizeau  effect,  but  has  become  the  basis  of  the  ‘Fizeau-like’
scattering of photons in the accelerated quantum vacuum near large gravitational fields.

To  understand  what  happens  in  photon  scattering  inside  a  moving  medium,  imagine  a
simplified  one-dimensional  quantum  model  of  the  propagation  of  light  in  a  refractive
medium. The medium consisting of an idealized moving crystal of velocity ‘V’, which is
composed  of  evenly  spaced,  point-like  atoms  of  spacing  ‘l’.  When  a  photon  traveling
between atoms at a speed ‘c’  (vacuum light speed) encounters an atom, that atom absorbs
it  and  another  photon  of  the  same  wavelength  is  emitted  after  a  time  lag  ‘t ’.  In  the
classical  wave  interpretation,  the  scattered  photon  is  out  of  phase  with  the  incident
photon.  We  can  thus  consider  the  propagation  of  the  photon  through  the  crystal  is  a
composite  signal.  As  the  photon  propagates,  part  of  the  time  it  exists  in  the  atom
(technically, existing as an electron bound elastically to some atom), and part of the time
as  a  photon  propagating  with  the  undisturbed  low-level  light  velocity  ‘c’.  When  the
photon changes existence to being a bound electron, the velocity is ‘V’. From this, it can
be shown (ref. 41, an exercise in algebra and geometry) that the velocity of the composite
signal ‘vc’  (ignoring atom recoil, which is shown to be negligible) is:

vc = c  [1 + (Vt /l) (1 - V/c)] / [1 + (ct /l)  (1 - V/c)]

       

                        (9.71)

If we set V=0, then vc = c  / (1 + ct /l) = c/n. Therefore, t /l = (n – 1)/c. Inserting this in the
above equations give:

vc =   [(c/n)  +  (1 – 1/n) V (1 - V/c)] /[1 -  (1 – 1/n)(V/c)] »
(to first order in V/c).
        

  c/n + (1 – 1/n2) V

            (9.72)

Again, this is Fresnel’s formula. Thus the simplified non-relativistic atomic model of the
propagation of light through matter explains the  Fresnel formula to the first order in V/c
through  the  simple  introduction  of  a  scattering  delay  between  photon  absorption  and
subsequent  re-emission.  This  analysis  is  based  on  a  semi-classical  approach.  What  does

62

quantum theory say about this scattering process? The best theory we have to answer this
question is QED.

9.8

 PHOTON SCATTERING IN THE ACCELERATED VACUUM

Anyone who believes in the existence of virtual fermion particles in the quantum vacuum
that  carry  mass,  will  acknowledge  the  existence  of  a  coordinated  general  downward
acceleration  of  these  virtual  particles  near  any  large  gravitational  field.  In  EMQG
gravitons from the real fermions on the earth exchange gravitons with the virtual fermions
of the vacuum (which carry electric charge), causing a downward acceleration. The virtual
particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  (now  accelerated  by  a  large  mass)  acts  on  light  (and
matter) in a similar manner as a stream of moving water acts on light (and matter) in the
Fizeau effect. How does this work mathematically?

Again, it is impossible to compute the interaction of an accelerated collection of virtual
particles of the quantum vacuum with light exactly. However, a simplified model can yield
useful  results.  We  will  proceed  using  the  semi-classical  model  proposed  by  Lorentz,
above. We have defined the raw light velocity ‘cr’  (EMQG, ref. 1) as the photon velocity
in between virtual particle scattering. Recall that raw light velocity is the shifting of the
photon  information  pattern  by  one  cell  at  every  clock  cycle  on  the  CA,  so  that  in
fundamental  units  it  is  an  absolute  constant.  Again,  we  assume  that  the  photon  delay
between absorption and subsequent re-emission by a virtual particle is ‘t ’, and the average
distance between virtual particle scattering is ‘l’. The scattered light velocity vc(t) is now a
function of time, because we assume that it is constantly varying as it moves downwards
towards  the  surface  in  the  same  direction  of  the  virtual  particles.  The  virtual  particles
move according to: a =gt, where g = GM/R2.

Therefore we can write the velocity of light after scattering with the accelerated quantum
vacuum:

vc(t) = cr  [1 + (gtt /l) (1 - gt/cr)] / [1 + (crt /l)  (1 - gt/cr)]

(9.81)

If we set the acceleration to zero, or gt = 0, then vc(t) = cr  / (1 + crt /l) = cr/n. Therefore,
t /l = (n – 1)/cr. Inserting this in the above equation gives:

vc(t)  =   [(cr/n)  +  (1 – 1/n) gt (1 - gt/cr)] / [1 -  (1 – 1/n)(gt/cr)]  »
…. to first order in  gt/cr. 

  cr/n  +  (1 – 1/n2) gt
(9.82)

Since  the  average  distance  between  virtual  charged  particles  is  very  small,  the  photons
(which are always created at velocity  cr) spend most of the time existing as some virtual
charged  particle  undergoing  downward  acceleration.  Because  the  electrically  charged
virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  are  falling  in  their  brief  existence,  the  photon
effectively takes on the same downward acceleration as the virtual vacuum particles (as
an average acceleration over macroscopic distances). In other words, because the index of

63

refraction of the quantum vacuum ‘n’  is so large (compared to no vacuum particles), and
because c = cr/n and we can write in equation 9.61:

vc(t) =  cr/n  +  (1 – 1/n2) gt = c + gt = c (1 + gt/c)  if n >>1.

Therefore for photons going with the flow (downwards): vc(t) = c (1 + gt/c) 
Similarly, for photons going against the flow (upwards):  vc(t) = c (1 - gt/c) 
as the refractive index of the quantum vacuum n ﬁ  ¥ .

(9.83)

(9.84)
(9.85)

Remember that this is a semi-classical derivation, and does not constitute an actual proof
of the scattering effects on photons. An important limitation of these results is the issue of
space-time,  which  we  cover  in  the  next  section.  This  issue  limits  the  accuracy  of  these
expressions to small local regions of distance and time.

These formulas are used by EMQG as a starting point for the expression for the variation
of light velocity near a large gravitational field at a point, and we show that this leads to
the  correct  amount  of  general  relativistic  4D  space-time  curvature,  taking  into  account
some  additional  assumptions.  To  see  the  connection  between  variable  light  velocity  and
space-time  effects  consider  the  following  thought  experiment.  Imagine  that  two  clocks
that are identically constructed, and each calibrated with a highly stable monochromatic
light source in the same reference frame. These clocks keep time by using a high-speed
electronic  divider  circuit  that  divides  the  light  output  frequency  by  “n”  such  that  an
electrical voltage pulse is produced every second. For example, the light frequency used as
the  clock  is  precisely  calibrated  to  1015  Hz;  this  light  frequency  is  converted  in  to  an
electronic  pulse  train  of  the  same  frequency,  where  it  is  divided  by  1015  to  give  one
electronic pulse every second. Another counter in this clock increments every time a pulse
is sent, thus displaying the total time elapsed in seconds on the clock display.

Now, let us place these two clocks in a gravitational field on earth with one of them on the
surface,  and  the  other  at  a  height  “h”  above  the  surface.  Imagine  that  the  clocks  are
compared every second to see if they are still running in unison in the gravitational field by
exchanging  light  signals.  We  would  find  that  as  time  progresses,  the  clocks  loose
synchronism, where the lower clock appears to run slower than the higher. According to
general relativity, light always maintains a constant speed, and 4D space-time curvature is
responsible for the difference in the timing of the two clocks, where the lower clock runs
slower. We argue that the accelerated  Fizeau-like quantum vacuum fluid affects the light
velocity  of  the  exchanged  light  signals,  and  it  also  affects  the  atomic  photon  emission
process. In the next section we derive the same time dilation effect predicted by general
relativity  using  eq.  9.85,  which  assumes  that  the  light  velocity  has  exactly  the  same
downward  acceleration  component  of  the  falling  electrically  charged  virtual  particles  of
the quantum vacuum (and a very high vacuum index of refraction).

9.9

SPACE-TIME CURVATURE OBTAINED FROM SCATTERING THEORY

In  this  section  we  are  in  a  position  to  mathematically  formulate  EMQG  4D  space-time
curvature for the specific example of spherically symmetric mass. We derive the expected
amount  of  space-time  curvature  effects  near  a  spherical,  non-rotating,  massive  object
using our results from scattering theory in the previous section. We compare our results to
those obtained from the Schwarzchild metric in section 9.1, which is the standard textbook
method of general relativity.

We now take a bold step (that we justify later, with certain qualifiers to do with space and
time that is inherent in these formulas) and assume that for the case on the surface of the
earth, equation 9.85 holds. Therefore:

ch = c(1 - gt/c) = c(1 - gh/c2), where t=h/c.

This  describes  the  propagation  of  photons  moving  upwards  for  a  distance  h,  but  we
assume it holds only for very short distances, where hﬁ 0. Technically this is true only at
a point, which means that this equation must be written in differential form. The reason
that we cannot say that it holds for large distances is because light velocity happens to
also depend on the very nature of space and time,  because the expression ‘c(1 - gh/c2)’
involves both space and time, implicitly.

Einstein  himself  derived  a  similar  expression  in  1911  for  the  velocity  of  light  in  a
gravitational field (ref. 55), before developing his general theory of relativity (ref. 56):

(9.90)

where  D
SO  is  the  difference  of  the  gravitational  potential  of  the  source  and  the
observation points S and O. This, however, leads to incorrect experimental values. Later
this was corrected by himself in 1915. However, Einstein was not aware of the existence
of the quantum vacuum at that time, and attributed this result to the degradation of the
photon energy as it climbs out of a gravitational potential.

In  what  follows,  we  ignore  the  special  relativistic  postulate  of  the  constancy  of  light
velocity  for  now,  and  return  to  this  issue  later.  We  will  take  the  position  that  photons
continuously vary their velocity (remember that on the CA, the velocity of light is still an
absolute  constant  in  between  vacuum  particle  scattering  events)  by  scattering  with  the
falling, electrically charged virtual particles.

In the scattering picture of light propagation, we found that the velocity of light takes on a
different  value  when  traveling  straight  upwards,  compared  to  straight  downwards,  an
effect  that  was  independently  proposed  by  V.  Petkov  (ref.  47,  1999).  According  to
Petkov:

F
“Up to now little attention has been paid to an expression for the velocity of light in a
gravitational field derived by Einstein in 1911. …  it is shown that the proper velocity of
light is anisotropic in non-inertial frames …”

Petkov believes that this can actually be measured experimentally (ref. 47). However, we
disagree! Light plays a central role in defining the nature of space and time.

If  light  velocity  varies  on  the  earth,  then  why  is  it  that  we  do  not  actually  observe  this
variation  in  light  velocity  in  real  experiments?  Part  of  the  answer,  of  course,  lies  in  the
incredibly small variation of light velocity on the earth (on the order of one part in 10-15).
More importantly, it involves the deep connection between the nature of space-time and
the propagation of light itself, first discovered by Einstein himself in his work on special
relativity  (1905)!  Einstein  showed  that  many  concepts  related  to  space  and  time  are
traceable to the behavior of light.

For example, the concept of simultaneous events is deeply related to the motion of light
(ref.  19,  20,  21).  The  derivation  of  the  Lorentz  transformations  and  the  resulting  time
dilation and Lorentz contraction effects are solely based on the behavior of light. These
considerations,  and  the  results  of  section  9.2  lead  us  to  believe  that  variations  of  light
velocity will result in space-time variations on actual clocks and rulers.

EMQG  provides  a  plausible  mechanism  for  light  velocity  variation:  the  scattering  of
photons with the falling vacuum near a large gravitational mass. This concept is based on
the concept that the vacuum acts like Fizeau-like quantum vacuum fluid. We will assume
that  light  velocity  varies,  (but  only  for  short  distances)  as  it  moves  upward  from  the
surface of the earth. As the photon moves upward from point r to point r+D r it decelerates
at -1g according to equation 16.54, and obtains a new velocity a short time D

earth from an identically constructed reference laser light source (l
r) to measure the same
length, and finds that when he counts the standard 1,000,000 wavelengths the reference
length has shortened (because of the wavelength increase). In general he concludes that
the distances at infinity s( ¥

which  is  again,  exactly  the  same  expression  for  length  that  we  obtained  from  the
Schwarzchild metric in eq. 16.15.

This equation specifies the amount of distortion for rulers on the earth “s( r )”  compared
to rulers positioned at infinity “s( ¥
 )”. Thus by postulating that it is the light velocity that
is actually varying (and not space-time curvature), we are led to the same amount of red
shift, and the same amount of space-time curvature.

DISCUSSION

So why insist that it is light velocity rather than space-time that is responsible for these
effects  on  earth,  especially  when  it  becomes  impossible  experimentally  to  tell  the
difference  between  the  two  results?  With  the  space-time  approach  we  have  to  assume,
without any prior reason, that a large mass curves space-time. We have to accept that it
just does this, without understanding the action principle! With the variable light velocity
approach  the  physical  action  that  exists  between  matter  and  space-time  becomes  well
understood! Matter acts on the vacuum particles, and the vacuum particles act on matter
and light, to give a curved space-time.

The  other  advantage  with  the  EMQG  approach  is  that  the  equivalence  of  space-time  in
accelerated  and  gravitational  fields  also  becomes  clear.  Therefore,  the  principle  of
equivalence  is  seen  to  hold  from  a  common  cause,  the  action  of  the  quantum  vacuum
which appears to be the same to a light particle or a mass in accelerated frames and in
gravitational frames. In short, we have closure as to why the principle of equivalence holds
for space-time!

We can now see that in order to formulate a theory of gravity involving observers with
measuring instruments (such as clocks and rulers) we must take into account how these

measurements are affected by the local conditions of the quantum vacuum. Our analysis
above  shows  that  quantum  vacuum  can  be  viewed  as  a  Fizeau-like  fluid  undergoing
downward acceleration near a massive object, which affects the velocity of light. Indeed,
not only is the velocity of light affected, it is all the particle exchange processes including
graviton exchanges. Therefore, we find that the accelerated Fizeau-like ‘quantum vacuum
fluid’  effects all forces.

This has consequences for the behavior of clocks, which are constructed with matter and
forces. After all, nobody questions the fact that a mechanical clock submerged in moving
water cannot keep proper time with respect to an external clock. Similarly, a clock near a
gravitational field (with a Fizeau-like, quantum vacuum fluid flow through the clock) also
cannot  be  expected  to  keep  proper  time  with  respect  to  an  observer  outside  the
gravitational  field.  The  accelerated  Fizeau-like  ‘quantum  vacuum  fluid’  moves  along
radius vectors directed towards the center of the earth, and thus has a specific direction of
action.  Therefore,  the  associated  space-time  effects  should  also  work  along  the  radius
vectors (and not parallel to the earth).

For the case of light moving parallel to the earth's surface, the light path is the result of a
tremendous number of photon to virtual particle scattering interactions (figure 10). Again
in between virtual particle scattering, the light velocity is constant and ‘straight’. The total
path  is  curved  as  shown  in  figure  10.  The  path  the  light  takes  is  called  a  geodesic  in
general relativity. In EMQG, this path simply represents the natural path that light takes
through the accelerated vacuum, which affects the motion of light. For the case of light
moving parallel to the floor of the accelerated rocket (figure 11), the path for light is also
the result of virtual particle scattering, but now the quantum vacuum is not in a state of
relative  acceleration.  Therefore,  the  path  is  straight  for  the  observer  outside  the  rocket.
The  observer  inside  the  rocket  sees  a  curved  path  simply  because  he  is  accelerating
upwards.

We now see why Einstein’s gravitational theory takes the form that it does. Because of the
continuously  varying  frequency  and  wavelength  of  the  light  with  height,  Einstein
interpreted  this  as  a  variation  of  space  and  time  with  height.  We  postulated  that  the
scattering of light with the falling vacuum changes the light velocity in absolute CA units,
which cause the measurements of space and time to be affected. As we have already seen,
these two alternative explanations cannot be distinguished by direct experimentation. This
is why the principle of the constancy of light velocity is still a postulate in general relativity
(through the acceptance of special relativity).

We are now in a position to understand the concept of the geodesic proposed by Einstein.
The  downward  acceleration  of  the  virtual  electrically  charged  masseons  of  the
quantum vacuum serves as an effective ‘electrical guide’  for the motion of light (and
for test masses) through space and time. This ‘electrical guide’  concept replaces the 4D
space-time geodesics that guide matter in motion in relativity. For light, this guiding action
is  through  the  electromagnetic  scattering  process  of  section  9.4.  For  matter,  the
electrically  charged  virtual  particles  guide  the  particles  of  a  mass  by  the  electrical  force

69

interaction that results from the relative acceleration. Because the quantum vacuum virtual
particle density is quite high, but not infinite (at least about 1090 particles/m3), the quantum
vacuum acts as a very effective reservoir of energy to guide the motion of light or matter.

The relative nature of 4D space-time can now be easily seen. Whenever the background
virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum  are  in  a  state  of  relative  acceleration  with
respect  to  an  observer,  the  observer  lives  in  curved  4D  space-time.  Why  should  the
reader accept this new approach, when both approaches give the same result? The reason
for accepting EMQG is that the action between a large mass and 4D space-time curvature
becomes quite clear. The reason that 4D space-time is curved in an accelerated reference
is also clear, and very much related to the gravitational case.

The  relative  nature  of  curved  4D  space-time  also  becomes  very  obvious.  An  observer
inside a gravitational field would normally live in a curved 4D space-time. If he decides to
free-fall, he cancels his relative acceleration with respect to the quantum vacuum, and 4D
space-time  is  restored  to  flat  4D  space-time  for  the  observer.  The  principle  of  general
covariance  no  longer  becomes  a  principle,  but  merely  results  for  the  deep  connection
between the quantum vacuum state for accelerated frames and gravitational frames. Last,
but  not  least,  the  principle  of  equivalence  is  completely  understood  as  a  reversal  of  the
(net  statistical)  relative  acceleration  vectors  of  the  charged  virtual  masseons  of  the
quantum vacuum, and real masseons that make up a test mass.

EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF THE EQUIVALENCE MODEL

We have suggested that the strong principle of equivalence does not hold at all in section
8. Mass Equivalence is also not perfect (section 8). Imagine that a very large test mass and
a very small test mass are dropped simultaneously on the earth (in a vacuum), We predict
that there will be an extremely small difference in the arrival time of the masses on the
surface of the earth, which is in slight violation of the principle of equivalence. This occurs
because on the earth there are direct graviton exchanges between the test mass and the
earth, which tend to unbalance perfect equivalence. The larger test mass has a much larger
excess  of  gravitons  exchanged  compared  to  the  tiny  mass,  resulting  in  a  greater  pure
gravitational  force  of  attraction.  However,  the  electrically  charge  quantum  vacuum
dominates  over  these  pure  graviton  forces,  and  stabilizes  the  fall  rate  and  causes  the
masses to reach the ground almost at the same time. This is because the electrical force
from the vacuum is on the order of 1040 times greater than the pure graviton generated
force for these test masses.

We  propose  several  new  experimental  tests  of  the  principle  of  equivalence  that  gives
results  that  are  different  from  the  conventional  general  relativistic  physics.  These
experiments are designed to show that the equivalence principle is not a perfect symmetry
of nature, and contains has a few flaws.

70

(1)  ANTI-MATTER  GRAVITATIONAL  PHYSICS  -  EMQG  opens  up  a  new  field  of
investigation, which we call anti-matter gravitational physics. We propose that if two
sufficiently large pieces of anti-matter are manufactured to allow measurement of the
mutual  gravitational  interaction,  then  the  gravitational  force  will  be  found  to  be
repulsive! The force will be equal in magnitude to -GM2/r2  where  M  is  the  mass  of
each of the equal anti-matter masses, r is their mutual separation, and G is Newton’s
gravitational constant). This is in clear violation of the principle of equivalence, since
in this case Mi = - Mg , instead of masses Mi = Mg. Antimatter that is accelerated in far
space  has  the  same  inertial  mass  ‘Mi’  as  ordinary  matter,  but  when  interacting
gravitationally with another antimatter mass it is repelled (Mg). (Note: The earth will
attract bulk anti-matter because of the large abundance of gravitons originating from
the  earth  of  the  type  that  induce  attraction).  This  means  that  no  violation  of
equivalence is expected for anti-matter dropped on the earth, where anti-matter falls
normally  (recall  that  virtual  masseons  and  anti-masseons  are  both  attracted  to  the
earth).  However,  an  antimatter  earth  will  repel  an  antimatter  mass  dropped  on  the
earth.  Recent  attempts  at  measuring  earth’s  gravitational  force  on  anti-matter  (e.g.
anti-protons will not reveal any deviation from the principle of equivalence).

 
(2)  VIOLATION  OF  THE  WEAK  EQUIVALENCE  PRINCIPLE  -  For  an  extremely
large test mass and a very small test mass dropped simultaneously on the earth (in a
vacuum free of air resistance), there will be an extremely small difference in the arrival
time of the masses, in slight violation of the principle of equivalence. This effect is on
the order of »
 D N x d , where D N is the difference in the number of masseon particles
in  the  two  masses,  and  d   is  the  ratio  of  the  gravitational  to  electric  forces  for  one
masseon.  This  experiment  is  very  difficult  to  perform  on  the  earth,  because  d   is
extremely  small  (» 10-40),  and  D N  cannot  be  made  sufficiently  large.  To  achieve  a
difference of D N =1030 particles between the small and large mass requires dropping a
molecular-sized atomic cluster and a large military tank simultaneously in the vacuum
in order to give a measurable deviation. Note: For ordinary objects that might seem to
have  a  large  enough  difference  in  mass  (like  dropping  a  feather  and  a  tank),  the
difference in arrival time may be obscured by background interference, or by quantum
effects  like  the  Heisenberg  uncertainty  principle  which  restrict  the  accuracy  of  time
measurements.

 
(3)  DETECTION  OF  THE  VIOLATION  OF  THE  STRONG  PRINCIPLE  OF
EQUIVALENCE  USING  A  GRAVITON  DETECTOR  -  The  strong  equivalence
principle does not hold at all, as we suggested in section 8! To see this, we suggest a
thought  experiment  involving  a  hypothetical  graviton  detector.  If  gravitons  can  be
detected  by  the  invention  of  a  graviton  detector/counter  in  the  distant  future,  then
there  will  be  easy  experimental  proof  for  the  violation  of  the  strong  principle  of
equivalence. The strong equivalence principle states that all the laws of physics are the
same  for  an  observer  situated  on  the  surface  of  the  earth  as  it  is  for  an  accelerated
observer on a rocket (1 g). The graviton detector will find a tremendous difference in
the  graviton  count  in  these  two  cases,  because  gravitons  are  vastly  more  numerous
here on the earth due to the vast numbers of masseons in the earth. On the rocket, the

71

graviton count would be negligible. Therefore a visual indicator could be placed on the
graviton  detector  box  that  would  easily  distinguish  between  accelerated  frames  and
gravitational frames. This is a gross violation of the strong equivalence principle.

 
(4)  REDUCTION OF GRAVITATIONAL MASS ELECTROMAGNETICALY - Since
mass  has  a  strong  electromagnetic  force  component,  a  sensitive  gravitational  mass
measurement  near  the  earth  might  be  disrupted  by  experimentally  manipulating  the
electrically  charged  virtual  particles  of  the  nearby  quantum  vacuum  through
electromagnetic means. If a rapidly fluctuating magnetic field (or rotating magnetic
field)  is  produced  under  a  mass  it  might  effect  the  instantaneous  virtual  charged
particle spectrum, and disrupt the tiny electrical forces contributed by each electrically
charged masseon of the mass. This may reduce the measured gravitational mass of an
object in the vicinity (this would also affect the inertial mass). In a sense, this device
would  act  like  a  primitive  weak  “anti-gravity”  device.  The  virtual  particles  are
constantly  being  “turned-over”  in  the  vacuum  at  different  rates  depending  on  the
energy, with the high frequency particles (and therefore, high-energy particles) being
replaced the quickest. If a magnetic field is made to fluctuate fast enough so that it
does  not  allow  the  new  virtual  particle  pairs  to  replace  the  old  and  smooth  out  the
disruption,  the  spectrum  of  the  vacuum  will  be  altered.  According  to  conventional
physics,  the  energy  density  of  virtual  particles  is  infinite,  which  means  that  all
frequencies of virtual particles are present. In EMQG there is a definite upper cut-off
to the frequency, and therefore the highest energy according to the Plank’s law: E=hu
,
where u
 is the frequency that a virtual particle can have. This frequency cutoff is very
roughly  on  the  order  of  the  plank  distance  scale.  We  can  therefore  state  that  the
smallest  wavelength  that  a  virtual  particle  can  have  is  on  the  order  of  about  10-35
meters, e.g. the plank wavelength (or a corresponding maximum Plank frequency of
about 1043  hertz  for  very  high  velocity  (» c)  virtual  particles).  Unfortunately  for  our
“anti-gravity”  device, it is technologically impossible to disrupt the highest frequencies.
According to the uncertainty principle, the relationship between energy and time is: D E
x D
t < h. This means that the high frequency end of the spectrum consists of virtual
particles  that  “turns-over”  the  fastest.  To  give  measurable  mass  change  the  higher
frequencies of the vacuum must be disrupted, which requires magnetic fluctuations on
the order of at least 1020 cycles per seconds. Therefore, only lower frequencies virtual
particles  of  the  vacuum  can  be  practically  affected,  and  only  small  changes  in  the
measured  mass  can  be  expected  with  today’s  technology.  As  a  result  of  this,  a
relationship  should  exist  between  the  amount  of  gravitational  (or  inertial)  mass  loss
and  the  frequency  of  electromagnetic  fluctuation  or  disruption.  The  higher  the
frequency  the  greater  the  mass  loss.  Work  on  the  Quantum  Hall  Effect  (ref.  29)  by
Laughlin has suggested that the electron density in a two-dimensional sheet under the
influence of a strong magnetic field causes the electrons to move in concert, with very
high  speed  swirling  vortices  created  in  the  resulting  2D  electron  gas.  In  ordinary
magnetic fields, electrons are merely  ‘pushed’  around,  while  a  strong  magnetic  field
causes the electrons to swirl in high-speed ‘whirlpools’. There is also a possibility that
this  ‘whirlpool’  phenomena  holds  for  the  virtual  particles  of  the  quantum  vacuum
under  the  influence  of  a  strongly  fluctuating  magnetic  field.  These  high-speed

72

whirlpools  might  disrupt  the  high  frequency  end  of  the  spectral  distribution  of
electrically  charged  virtual  particles  in  small  pockets.  Therefore,  there  might  be  a
greater  mass  loss  under  these  circumstances.  Recent  experiments  on  mass  reduction
with rapidly rotating magnetic fields are inconclusive at this time. Reference 30 gives
an  excellent  and  detailed  review  of  the  various  experiments  on  reducing  the
gravitational force with superconducting magnets.

11.

CONCLUSIONS

Using a newly developed quantum field theory of gravity theory called EMQG, we have
illustrated the hidden quantum processes involved in Einstein’s  principle  of  equivalence.
We  found  that  almost  the  same  quantum  processes  occurring  in  inertial  mass  are  also
happening in gravitational mass. We found that gravity involves  two pure, quantum force
particle  exchange  processes.  Both  the  photon  and  graviton  particle  exchanges  occur
simultaneously for a test mass in a large gravitational field, whereas for inertial mass only
photon exchanges are involved.

We modified a new theory of inertia first introduced by Haisch, Rueda, and Puthoff, which
we  call  HRP  inertia.  In  HRP  inertia,  inertia  is  the  resulting  electromagnetic  force
interaction of the charged ‘parton’  particles making up a mass with the background virtual
photon  field,  which  is  called  the  zero  point  fluctuations  (or  ZPF).  We  modified  HRP
inertia, (which we call Quantum Inertia, or QI), which involves the introduction of a new
particle of nature called the  masseon. The masseon contains the smallest possible quanta
of electric charge as well as the smallest possible quanta of ‘mass-charge’.

Masseons combine with other masseons to produce all the known  fermion mass particles
of the standard model. The masseon is electrically charged, as well as possessing a new
form of charge called ‘mass-charge’. Mass-charge is analogous to electric charge, where
gravitons  take  the  place  of  photons  as  the  exchange  particle  for  the  pure  gravitational
force, and masseons take the place of electrons as the charge source and destination. The
physics  of  graviton  exchanges  between  masseons  is  virtually  the  same  as  photon
exchanges for electrons in QED. Gravitons have spin 1, just as the photon (not spin 2).

Quantum Inertia is based on the idea that inertial force is due to the tiny electromagnetic
force  interactions  originating  from  each  charged  masseon  particle  of  real  matter
undergoing  relative  acceleration  with  respect  to  the  vast  swarm  of  virtual,  electrically
charged masseon particles of the nearby quantum vacuum. These tiny forces add up to the
total resistance force opposing the accelerated motion in Newton’s law ‘F = MA’, where
the sum of each of the tiny masseon forces equals the total inertial force. When masseons
move through the vacuum at a constant velocity (i.e., an inertial frame), the sum of the
total vacuum forces is zero, and the vacuum does not oppose the motion. Therefore, the
virtual masseons of the quantum do not act as a form of an ether for inertial observers.

73

We  proposed  that  gravity  also  involves  this  very  same  ‘inertial’  electromagnetic  force
component  found  inside  an  accelerated  mass  above.  This  is  the  source  of  the  deep
connection  between  inertia  and  gravity,  which  is  at  the  heart  of  Newtonian  mass
equivalence. Since virtual masseons possesses mass-charge, and the earth (composed of
real masseons) possesses mass-charge, the result is that virtual  masseons of the quantum
vacuum fall during their very brief life-times, which has profound effects on test masses.

Newtonian mass equivalence has been explained as a consequence of the falling quantum
vacuum. Inside a test mass subjected to a large gravitational fields, there exists a similar
quantum  vacuum  process  that  occurs  for  an  inertial  mass,  where  the  roles  of  the  real
charged masseon particles of the mass and the virtual, electrically charged masseons of the
quantum vacuum are reversed. Now it is the electrically charged virtual masseon particles
of  the  quantum  vacuum  that  are  accelerating  (falling),  while  the  mass  particles  are  at
relative rest. The reason why the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum fall in a large
gravitational field is the huge numbers of graviton particles that are exchanged between
the earth and the surrounding virtual masseon particles of the quantum vacuum.

Furthermore, the general relativistic Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) also results from
this common physical process existing at the quantum level in both gravitational mass and
inertial mass. The falling, electrically charged, virtual  masseons  of  the  quantum  vacuum
affect both the motion of real test masses, and also the motion of light. The action of the
falling quantum vacuum on light is very much reminiscent of the action of flowing water
on the motion of light in the Fizeau experiment. The path that light takes while moving
parallel to the surface of the earth, through the falling quantum vacuum, is curved. This
implies  space-time  curvature.  The  action  of  falling  ‘Fizeau-like’  quantum  vacuum  on
clocks and rulers is responsible for the origin Riemannian curved 4D space-time geometry
near the earth, and is the basis of a quantum theory of general relativity.

Therefore based on a new theory of quantum gravity called EMQG, we have discovered
the  hidden  quantum  interactions  that  occur  in  Newtonian  inertia  and  the  quantum
machinery responsible for Einstein’s Weak Equivalence Principle.

The Observer is stationed on the surface of the
Sun. The virtual particle pattern is disrupted by
the Earth and Moon. It is difficult to see that the
resulting virtual particle pattern causes the two

bodies to reach the Sun at the same time.

However, if the observer is placed in free fall,
the virtual pattern is the same as Figure #8,

The Earth and Moon arrive on the floor of the huge rocket at the same time (the floor

simply moves up to meet these bodies). But now, the virtual masseon particles near these

two bodies are distorted and interacting with the real masseons in these two bodies.

Figure #13 - MOTION OF REAL PHOTONS IN THE PRESENCE OF VIRTUAL PARTICLE NEAR EARTH

The Observer is stationed on the surface of the

Earth. The virtual particles are accelerating
downwards at1g through graviton exchanges

with the earth. Light scatters with the electrically
charged virtual particles, thus altering the path.

Electrically charged virtual particles

are  accelerated (1g) through
graviton exchanges with Earth.

FIZEAU-LIKE SCATTERING OF LIGHT THROUGH THE ACCELERATED VACUUM

The  photons scatter with the electrically

charged virtual particles, which are

accelerating downward at 1g. Photons
travel perfectly straight, and at a much

higher velocity (in absolute units)  than the

measured light velocity (which is

constant). The scattering deflects the
photon path, and reduces it's velocity
through Fizeau-like vacuum scattering.

This segment of the light beam travels in a

perfect straight path and at an absolute

constant speed, and represents  the actual
low-level CA photon velocity (Cabs) between

the electrically charged virtual particle

scattering, and is not affected by anything.

However, the Fizeau-like scattering
reduces the absolute light velocity.

PROCESS

Observer A is stationed outside the rocket at rest

(non-accelerated). The virtual particles are at
relative rest with respect to him (accelerated

state). Light travels perfectly straight for Observer

A outside the rocket, but appears to curve for
observer B stationed on the floor of the rocket

Only the rungs of the ladder are

discernible to observer A

Ladder Velocity  = c

Observer A wishes to measure
both the velocity of the ladder
and the spacing of the rungs

The ladders represent different wavelengths
of light, where the wavelength of the light is
represented by the spacing of the rungs.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH

BETWEEN THE CHANGE IN VELOCITY

OF THE LIGHT AND A CHANGE IN

FREQUENCY AND WAVLENGTH DUE TO

4D SPACE-TIME CURVATURE

If Observer A and B agree on the spacing of the

rungs on the ladder and Observer B moves the ladder

upward at velocity c. Observer A can measure the
velocity of the ladder by measuring the rung spacing
'd' and by measuring the time 't' for a pair of rungs to

pass the fixed distance 'd' on his ruler. The ladder

velocity is given by c = d/t.

Ladder Velocity  = c

Observer B

Observer B can choose among three different

ladder types, and he can also choose the
velocity that the ladder moves upwards

Figure #15 - It is impossible to distinguish between the change in the
velocity of light versus space-time curvature when light propagates from a
lower to a higher gravitational potential. Light is represented by a ladder
where the peaks of the wave are replaced by rungs on a ladder.

ENCOUNTER

In the vacuum far from earth, we illustrate a short segment on the Plank scale. Light velocity reduces to the average light velocity of 'c' we measure  in  the lab over
macroscopic distance scales by virtual particle scattering. If the CA absolute velocity is 'Cabs' then: c = Cabs / n,   where n is the 'vacuum index of refraction' of  light

IN EMPTY SPACE, PHOTONS FREQUENTLY

ENCOUNTER ELECTRICALLY CHARGED VIRTUAL
PARTICLES WHICH REDUCE THE AVERAGE LIGHT

VELOCITY TO THE MEASURED VALUE OF C

Unlike the case illustrated above for
light travel in the far vacuum away
from gravity, the electrically charged

virtual particle encounters are
modified, where  now the virtual
particles are in free fall. This

reduces the velocity of light further
by c (r +delta r) = c  (1-g delta t / c)

where this is applicable only for
infinitesimal distances and time.

acceleration given by:  GM / r2

NOTE: It is important to
realize that a photon is

propagates at an absolute

The electrically charged virtual
particle absorbs the photon here,
and the photon momentarily ceases
to exist for a brief time. Meanwhile

the virtual particle is falling.

In this region the photon propagates

at an absolute constant rate,
determined by the CA cells and
clock cycle.  It is unaffected here.

This theory is based on both Photon and Graviton exchanges occuring with the virtual

exchanges with the vacuum particles. The Equivalence Principle  is derived from this.

In a 3D Geometric Cellular Automata, the numeric content of Cell Ci,j,k is uniquely determined by the numeric

contents of each of the surrounding 26 neighbouring cells (and possibly with it's own numeric state). On the next
CA 'clock cycle' the contents of cell Ci,j,k is determined by a function (or algorithm) Fi,j,k such that the contents of

the cell Ci,j,k = F(Ci+x,j+y,k+z) where x,y,z take on all the following values: -1,0,1. This same function F is

programmed into each and every cell in the entire CA. In the figure below, the binary number system is chosen
for illustration purposes (any number system can be used). The dotted lines indicate what cells affect cell Ci,j,k.

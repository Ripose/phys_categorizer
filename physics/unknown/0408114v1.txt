Abstract 
 
 
Laboratory  observation  of  high-density  filamentation  or  clustering  of  electronic 
charge suggests that under certain conditions strong coulomb repulsion can be overcome 
by  cohesive  forces  as  yet  imprecisely  defined.    Following  an  earlier  suggestion  by 
Casimir,  we  investigate  here  the  possibility  that  Casimir  forces  can  lead  to  charge 
clustering  of  the  type  observed,  and  conclude  that  such  forces  may  play  a  role  in  the 
generation of robust high-charge-density effects.

Introduction 
 
The  formation  of  high-density,  electronic  charge  clusters  has  been  reported  to 
occur under certain precisely-defined laboratory conditions, ranging from quantum dots 
for nanotechnology applications [1], through high-power-density microelectronic devices 
utilizing  micro-arc  discharge  processes  [2,3],  to  the  containment  of  plasma  for  fusion 
purposes [4]. 
 
Aside  from  the  trivial  case  of  electron  charge  neutralization  by  positive  ions, 
mechanisms  proposed  in  the  literature  for  high-density  charge  confinement  range  from 
standard magnetic pinch models to exotic, soliton-like localized-wave (LW) solutions in 
plasma-EM wave interactions [5]. 

 
Another  candidate  mechanism  that  has  yet  to  be  fully  explored  with  regard  to 
high-density charge confinement is provided by the short-range, attractive van der Waals 
and Casimir forces driven by vacuum-fluctuation phenomena.  Such forces derive from 
the  fact  that  the  vacuum,  rather  than  being  the  void  of  classical  theory,  is  the  seat  of 

electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations (ZPF) comprising significant energy density and 
radiation pressure.  Theory predicts and experiments verify the existence of ZPF-driven 
van der Waals-type forces between closely-spaced metallic or dielectric boundaries, and 
between  free-charge  distributions.    One  particular  example  is  the  Casimir  force,  the 
attractive ZPF-induced quantum force between conducting parallel plates [6-9], recently 
measured with good precision [10,11].  Detailed analysis shows that the attractive force 
can be modeled as due to partial shielding of the ZPF radiation pressure from the interior 
region of the plates which results in the plates being pushed together [12]. 

 
As  to  the  issue  of  charge  confinement  specifically,  it  was  Casimir  himself  who 
first  proposed  that  the  ZPF-induced  pressure  forces  might  provide  a  mechanism  for  the 
confinement of charge in (semi-classical models of) elementary particles [13], a problem 
even  more  challenging  than  the  laboratory  observations  under  consideration  here.    To 
explore this concept we examine the consequences of collective behavior of multiparticle 
charge distribution in the geometries proposed by Casimir. 

 
 

II.  Multiparticle van der Waals/Casimir-Force Interaction 
 
  
Early  investigation  by  Casimir  of  vacuum-fluctuation-driven,  multiparticle  van 
der Waals interactions led to the realization that summation over the collective particle-
particle interactions could be recast to advantage in terms of the restructuring of vacuum 
energy  in  response  to  the  boundaries  defined  by  the  particle  distribution  [6].    This  is 
because  charge  distributions  which  can  respond  to  fields  constitute  boundaries  which 
reconfigure those fields, vacuum ZPF fields included.  The classic example is the Casimir 
Effect itself in which parallel conducting plates exclude all but a finite number of modes 
in the interior spacing, with  the consequence that the radiation pressure outward on the 
plates  associated  with  the  interior  modes  is  less  that  the  pressure  inward  due  to  the 
(essentially infinite in number) external modes.  This yields a net radiation pressure that 
drives the plates together with a force per unit area given by [12]

where d is the spacing between the plates. 
 
With  regard  to  the  problem  of  interest  here,  the  containment  of  high-density 
 
charge,  Casimir  suggested  that  a  shell-like  distribution  of  charge  might  partially  shield 
vacuum fields from the interior of the shell with the result that net inward pressure would 
compensate  outwardly-directed  coulomb  forces  to  yield  a  stable  configuration  at  small 
dimensions.  Along these lines Casimir offered two models for consideration [13], one in 
which interior fields associated with discrete states permitted by boundary conditions are 
assumed to exist as in the parallel-plates example above (Casimir Shell Model I), and a 
second which assumes total shielding of interior fields up to a Compton-frequency cutoff 
for electron-ZPF field interactions (Casimir Shell Model II). 
 

III.  Casimir Shell Models 
 

In Casimir’s Shell Model I, interior fields associated with discrete states permitted 
by boundary conditions are assumed to exist.  One of the first applications of this model 
to charge confinement considered a semiclassical electron as a conducting spherical shell 
carrying  a  homogeneously-distributed  surface  charge  e  whose  tendency  to  expand  by 
coulomb repulsion is checked by inwardly-directed ZPF radiation pressure (the Casimir 
force).    Unfortunately  for  the  model,  a  detailed  analysis  found  that  for  this  case  the 
Casimir pressure was outwardly-directed, augmenting rather than canceling the coulomb 
pressure [14-17]. 
 
With  regard  to  Casimir’s  Shell  Model  II  (total  shielding  of  interior  fields  up  to 
some cutoff frequency) its plausibility finds some degree of support in work by one of the 
authors (H.P.) that traces the source of the ZPF fields to the quantum-fluctuation motion 
of charged particles distributed over cosmological space [18].  Such fields could then in 
principle be shielded from an interior space by a sufficiently dense charge distribution.  It 
is this second model that shows some promise. 

 
With the spectral energy density of the ZPF fields given by 
 

integration  over  frequency  from  zero  up  to  a  cutoff  frequency 
interactions yields a vacuum energy density  Vu  effective in such interactions

With regard to the cutoff frequency

example in calculations of the Lamb shift [19,20].  Substitution into the above equation 
then yields an expression for the diameter  d  of the spherical-shell distribution,

We  see  that  the  diameter  d   for  the  spherical-shell  distribution  predicted  by  this 
 multiplied by the square root of the 
calculation is simply the Compton wavelength 
number  of  electrons  on  the  shell.    Such  numbers  are  in  rough  correspondence  with 
claimed observations of charge clustering phenomena.  
 
 
As  an  additional  check  on  this  simple  model  we  examine  whether  the  so-called 
Schrödinger pressure plays a confounding role in this configuration.2  The expression for 
the Schrödinger pressure exerted by N electrons confined to a volume V in their lowest 
state (N/2 with spin up, N/2 with spin down) is [21]

A  direct  comparison  of  the  magnitude  of  the  Schrödinger  pressure  against  the  vacuum

and  coulomb  pressures  given  by  (
eu ,  respectively,  indicates  that  the 
Schrödinger pressure can be neglected for electron numbers of interest here, say 
. 
 
Finally,  we  note  that  the  simple  spherical-shell  configuration  analyzed  here 
 
satisfies  a  first-order  stability  condition  that,  once  configured,  a  slight  change  in  radius 
results in a restoring force that tends to return the sphere to its original size.

Laboratory  observation  of  high-density  filamentation  or  clustering  of  electronic 
charge  has  motivated  an  investigation  into  potential  cohesive  mechanisms  whereby 
repulsive  coulomb  forces  could  be  overcome  by  some  form  of  compensatory  force  of 
attraction.    Of  the  various  possibilities  discussed  in  the  literature,  we  have  chosen  to 

                                                 
2 The Schrödinger pressure is a force that resists particle confinement due to the wave nature of matter that 
derives from a combination of the uncertainty and Pauli Exclusion principles.   

examine a model suggested by Casimir that invokes the possibility of charge confinement 
by  Casimir  forces.    The  resulting  analysis  indicates  that  the  cooperative  action  of  large 
numbers of charges by Casimir-type effects does provide a potential candidate for charge 
confinement of roughly the right order of magnitude to correlate with reported laboratory 
observations.

Abstract:  The  statistical  properties  of  acoustic  emission  signals  for  tool
condition monitoring (TCM) applications in mechanical lathe machining are
analyzed in this paper. Time series data and root mean square (RMS) values
at various tool wear levels are shown to exhibit features that can be put into
relation with ageing in both cases. In particular, the histograms of raw data
show  power-law  distributions  above  a  cross-over  value,  in  which  newer
cutting  tools  exhibit  more  numerous  larger  events  compared  with  more
worn-out  ones.  For  practical  purposes,  statistics  based  on  RMS  values  are
more  feasible,  and  the  analysis  of  these  also  reveals  discriminating  age-
related features. The assumption that experimental RMS histograms follow a
Beta  (b )(cid:31) distribution has also been tested. The residuals of the modeling b
functions indicate that the search for a more appropriate fitting function for
the experimental distribution is desirable.

1. Introduction

The challenge of extensively using TCM devices and techniques in industrial manufacturing
processes has become ever more important. In this field, a continuous improvement in terms
of reliability and practicality of sensor fusion systems and algorithms is the actual challenge
[Govekar  et  al.,  2000].  In  fact,  advanced  sensor  design,  coupled  with  signal  processing
technologies, enables one to have more refined information regarding process conditions, so
that optimized control leads to product quality improvements, reduced non-productive times,
and thus, considerable cost savings.

An  excellent  review  of  the  state-of-the-art,  technological  challenges  and  future
developments  of  these  systems  is  described  by  [Byrne  et  al.,1995].  This  paper  describes  in
great detail the physical parameters to be analyzed for industrial control applications, together
with their appropriate sensory systems. Among these, acoustic emission (AE) signal analysis
has been demonstrated to be one of the most efficient TCM techniques that can be applied to
machining  processes  control,  as  the  impressive  amount  of  literature  on  this  subject  shows.
Using  this  framework,  our  paper  tackles  the  problem  of  gaining  greater  insight  into  the
fundamental  statistical  properties  of  AE  signals  generated  during  turning  machining
processes,  so  that  an  appropriate  implementation  of  AE  sensor-based  devices  will  lead  to
efficient TCM systems.

Results of the effects of tool wear on the signal's statistical characteristics have been

studied, both on their time series and RMS (root mean squared) values.

2. Operational conditions and experimental set-up

Measurements have been performed of machining stainless steel (AISI 303) bars on a SAG14
GRAZIANO  lathe  machine.  Cutting  speeds  range  from  0.5  to  1  m/s,  while  feed  rates  and
cutting depths are kept constant at 0.0195 mm/turn and 2 mm respectively. These low-fatigue
machining  conditions  have  been  chosen  for  the  purposes  of  the  present  paper.  In  all
measurements,  cutting  tool  inserts  are  ''IMPERO''  PCLNR  with  2020/12  type  tungsten

carbide;  the  acquisitions  have  been  performed  on  inserts  with  various  degrees  of  wear.
Specifically, inserts have been grouped into three different wear categories: new ones, those
estimated to be half-way through their life-cycle (50%),  and  those  completely  worn  through
(100%).  In  the  new  and  100%  worn  cases,  8  cutting  edges  were  analyzed  per  wear  level,
whereas only 4 edges were utilized in the 50% case. For each edge, one acquisition run was
conducted, collecting 15 banks of 40.960 AE time series points corresponding to 16.38 ms,
for a total of 614.400 points for run. Hence, a total of 12.288.000 (4.9152s) AE time series
points were collected over the 20 runs. To achieve this, a custom-built AE sensor was used,
made of a small rectangular-shaped  piezoelectric  ceramic  (PZT-5),  5.0x1.5x0.7  mm  in  size,
housed inside a little cavity bored into the cutting tool holder to protect it from chip damages
and liquid coolant effects, and placed about two centimeters from the AE signal sources. In
fact,  the  propagation  of  AE  signals  in  the  investigated  range  is  characterized  by  significant
attenuation. Thus, to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio, the sensor should be placed as close
as possible to the machining point where the AE signal is generated [Jemielniak, 2000]. As an
added  benefit,  reduction  of  the  signal  distortion  due  to  the  number  of  interfaces  and
mechanical resonance is also achieved by avoiding a long measurement chain. An electrically
conductive adhesive is used to bond the ceramic to the internal face of the cavity. The actual
experimental set-up is roughly sketched in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of experimental set-up.

The  signal  detected  by  the  transducer  is  amplified  and  filtered  in  the  200  kHz-1000  kHz
range. The filtered signal is then captured by a Tektronix digital oscilloscope (TDS420) using
a  2.5  MHz    sampling  rate  and  finally  stored  in  a  Personal  Computer  through  an  IEEE488
interface.  Blank  measurements  performed  just  prior  to  machining  indicate  no  significant
electrical  noise.  The  data  have  been  analyzed  both  directly  in  their  time  series  form  and
through root mean squared (RMS) values.

3. Experimental results

3.1  Time series analysis

performed using inserts in three stages of wear are portrayed in Fig. 2.

These frequency distributions are normalized to their area and grouped into 126 classes. The
curves exhibit a power-law behavior:

above a cross-over value. The value of the slope (nearly a=-3.7) is similar for all three stages
of wear, and the corresponding exponent for the energy is a=-2.35, because it can be derived
from the amplitude exponent. In this range, data from measurements using tools with greater
wear  show  a  smaller  frequency  count  for  a  given  value  in  amplitude.  This  leads  to  the
conclusion  that  in  this  set  of  trials,  the  newer  tools  are  the  most  active  ones  in  terms  of
acoustic emission. It is interesting to note that this power-law behavior has been observed in
many studies on acoustic emission signals, e.g,. those associated with the formation of micro-
fractures  [Petri,  1996].  Power-law  characteristics  are  associated  with  scale  invariant
properties underlying the physical phenomena under study, and in some cases, this has been
explained  by  self-organized  criticality  (SOC)  [Bak  et  al.,  1997]  models.  These  promising
results should stimulate future investigations of these AE power-law features correlated with
tool wear.

3.2 RMS analysis

The  analysis  of  the  RMS  has  been  conducted  calculating  values  on  the  basis  of  100  points,
corresponding to 40 ms. This makes this choice effective in making RMS signal sensitive to
the different contributions from burst and continuous events. A substantial effort in the past
has been dedicated to analyzing the relationship between RMS and tool wear level in various
experimental  situations,  e.g.,  see  [Kannatey-Asibu  and  Dornfeld,  1982]  for  high-speed  steel
tools  and  [Jemielniak  and  Otman,  1998]  for  identifying  catastrophic  tool  failure  (CTF)
conditions  in  carbide  inserts.  To  obtain  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  RMS  properties  as  a
function of ageing, we have analyzed their frequency distribution by grouping the values into
60 classes. For each wear level, the average histograms with their error bars are shown on the
left side of Fig.3. Each bin value is obtained by dividing it by the largest of the entire sample
set, and the curves are normalized to the unit area. The curves show a noticeable shift toward
lower levels of the modal value of the frequency distribution for increasing levels of wear, and
a change in the skewness tending toward values compatible with a symmetrical shape. To test
the difference among these graphs, we have performed a T-test analysis regarding the sample
means. The null hypothesis of equal means can be rejected with a confidence level of 95%.

This approach seems to be effective in showing discriminating tool wear features and could be
used as the basis for implementing algorithms for TCM systems.

In  the  literature,  borrowing  from  a  technique  used  in  the  description  of  surface
roughness [Whitehouse, 1978], various attempts have been made to determine tool condition
relying on the hypothesis that a Beta distribution  f(x) [Kannatey-Asibu and Dornfeld, 1982]
[Jemielniak and Otman, 1998], properly describes the probability density function pdf  of the
RMS values:

                                                    
where  b

                                             (2)

With this assumption, it is possible to characterize the moments of the distribution in terms of
the two parameters r and s, and vice-versa. In particular, as far as mean m and variance s2 are
concerned, we have:

                                                (3)

Thus, values for r and s can be estimated on the basis of the mean and variance of the data set.
Past  studies  have  shown  that  r,s  pairs  are  scattered  in  different  ways,  depending  on  tool
conditions [Kannatey-Asibu and Dornfeld, 1982]. One shortcoming of this method is that no
estimate of the errors on the r and s parameters is directly available; this is particularly serious
because  real-life  signals  often  contain  outliers  that  can  bring  a  noticeable  shift  in  the  actual
values  of  both  mean  and  variance.  One  possibility  is  to  use  more  robust  estimators  (e.g.,
median instead of mean), although this still does not give an error estimate for the calculated
parameters.  A  further  choice  is  to  perform  a  nonlinear  best-fit  on  the  data  set  using  the
function given in Eq.(1).

Fitting the function given in Eq.(1) requires a nontrivial effort, because this function
cannot  be  linearized,  so  that  the  fitting  process  requires  initial  seed  values;  these  might  be
obtained  using  the  r,s  estimation  technique  described  above.  Additionally,  fully  automating
the  fitting  process  requires  appropriate  handling  of  specific  exceptions  that  can  occur  in
nonlinear regressions (e.g., singular matrix conditions, reaching iteration limits without having
satisfied tolerance criteria, etc.). In this paper, no attempt to automate this process has been
made.

In the right side of Fig.3, the best-fit of the frequency distributions of the same data
sets  as  in  the  left  part  are  shown.  From  these  graphs,  we  see  that  although  there  is  a  good
matching between the fitting function and the data sets in the neighborhood of the peaks, some
discrepancies  are  visible  in  the  residual  for  RMS  bin  values  just  above  the  peak  where  the
curves level off. This indicates that in this range, the data sets are richer in events than Eq.(1)
indicates. This suggests that a better empirical fitting-function may exist. In Fig.4 r,s estimates
from Eq.(2) are compared to the ones obtained by the best-fitting process. It is evident that the
two groups differ greatly and that these discrepancies are not compatible considering the error
estimates given on the fitted parameters. Furthermore, the scattering

pattern of these two groups are entirely different; whereas both the best-fitted r,s parameters
tend  to  increase  with  wear,  the  estimated  ones  show  an  essentially  opposite  behavior.  One
possible  explanation  for  this  difference  is  that  while  the  best-fit  process  minimizes  mean-
square differences between the fitting function and the frequency distribution (so that heavily
populated  bins  are  weighted  more),  the  estimate  method  relies  on  m and  s2.Variance,  in
particular,  is  highly  sensitive  to  outliers.  Values  far  from  the  mean  weigh  heavily  on  its
determination.

4. Discussion and conclusions

Various ways of analyzing the statistical properties of AE signals in a TCM application have
been  illustrated.  In  particular,  we  have  seen  that  it  is  possible  to  observe  tool  wear  level
related features both in AE time series and their RMS values. Particularly interesting are the
statistical  properties  of  the  former,  in  which  power  law  characteristics  have  been  identified
through  the  use  of  log-log  histograms.  This  behavior  has  already  been  observed  in  the
properties of acoustic emission signals in numerous other fields.

The frequency distributions of the RMS values have also been studied as a function
of  wear,  showing  that  even  in  this  case  it  is  possible  to  identify  discriminating  features.
Moreover,  a  beta  function  model  for  describing  the  RMS's  pdf  has  been  tested.  We  have
compared the parameters r,s of the beta distribution obtained by a best-fit procedure to their
estimates  computed  directly.  The  residuals  in  the  best-fitted  function  indicate  that  a  more
appropriate  fitting  model  should  be  sought,  and  that  the  comparison  of  the  parameters
obtained  in  this  way  are  entirely  different  from  those  estimated  through  the  statistical
moments  of  the  data.  For  these  reasons,  future  efforts  will  be  dedicated  in  investigating  the
theoretical form of the pdf of RMS values related to power-law distributed time series.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The object of this paper is to gain an insight into  black holes.   This is first 

done by finding the simplest possible equation for black hole radiation.  Then we 

shall find the simplest possible model which can give some comprehension as to 

why black hole entropy appears to be related only to its surface area.  This attempt 

at understanding black hole entropy is done in the same spirit as was the paper on

The strategy here will be to find the number of elementary constituents, 

N, which fill a black hole, simply modeled as a gravitational bottle.   The 

constitutents are unspecified and may be gravitons or more exotic entities such 

as branes.  We shall find that they have a mass that is inversely proportional to 

the horizon radius of the black hole.  Once we have N, statistical mechanics will 

be employed to determine their entropy, although it is not clear that it is 

applicable to black holes.  And even if it is applicable, it is not obvious  how to 

apply it.  We can see this by briefly considering the applicability and limitations 

of Liouville's theorem with respect to black hole thermodynamics,  since it is so 

central to statistical mechanics.  In turn, statistical mechanics represents a 

foundation for thermodynamics.   

 

First  of  all  Liouville's  theorem  applies  only  to  a  non-dissipative 

system in which energy (KE + PE) is conserved.  To a good approximation 

energy is conserved for a large black hole as it hardly radiates, but this is 

not  a  good  approximation  for  a  small  black  hole  due  to  Hawking 

radiation.    The  system  of  any  size  black  hole  and  Hawking  radiation 

conserves mass-energy.  However, this is not conserved for the black hole 

itself.    

 

 

Second  and  perhaps  even  more  importantly,  correlation  with 

thermodynamics  depends  subtly  on  the  ergodic  hypothesis,  since  it  is 

assumed that the system can indeed move from one region of phase space 

to  another  based  upon  the  equations  of  motion,  consistent  with 

conservation of energy.  The ergodic hypothesis implies that every state of 

-3- of 11 

the  system  can  be  reached  directly  or  indirectly  from  every  other  state.  

This means that if the energy of the system is determined within a range  
D E,  the  probability  of  finding  the  system  in  a  certain  state  compatible 

with that energy is the same for each state.   

 

Third and most importantly in not only the ergodic hypothesis, but 

as the basis of statistical mechanics, the time average over the evolution of 

the system is replaced by the average over the different states.  Black hole 

thermodynamics in general, and black hole entropy in particular does not 

clearly  specify  what  the  states are.  Nor is the validity of doing this self-

evident in general relativity, because of the elasticity of space-time.  How 

is it applied to the surface of a black hole where time appears to stand still 

from the perspective of a distant observer?    

Although the simple analysis that will be presented (starting with Sec. 3) 

may seem to also skirt these issues, it circumvents them much less than the area 

entropy algorithm as well as indicating why it works so well.  At least partial 

success is attained in obtaining an expression for entropy that agrees remarkably 

well with the black hole entropy functional dependence that was obtained by 

Bekenstein (1972, 1973, 1974).   

It is noteworthy that the prime critic of Bekenstein's 1972 conception  was 

Hawking, who three years later (Hawking,1975) embraced the concept and 

found the constant of proportionality to be 1/4.  Hawking's main criticism had 

been that if black holes have entropy, they must have temperature, and if they 

have temperature they must radiate; and everyone knows that black holes can't 

radiate.  He withdrew this criticism when he realized that black holes can 

radiate.    

2.   SIMPLEST EQUATIONS FOR BLACK HOLE RADIATION

  Hawking (1974, 1975) introduced what is now called Hawking radiation as 

the effective black body radiation from a black hole in terms of the 4th power of 

the black hole temperature and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.  In terms of 

fundamental parameters the power radiated from a black hole of mass M is 

 

 

 

given by (Rabinowitz, 1999):

(3) 

which is the simplest possible expression for the power radiated from a black 

hole.  It is also the most intuitive in saying that the radiated power is 

proportional to the black hole density, 

. When the density is high as it is for 

small black holes, the power is high.  When the density is low as it is for large 

black holes, the power is low.   

  Other  radiation mechanisms such as gravitational tunneling radiation 

(GTR)  generalized  to  n-space,  and  higher  dimensional  entropy  are 

explored  in  Rabinowitz  (2001a,  b).    If  we  combine  the  GTR  power  with 

Eq. (2) we obtain

Equations  (3)  and  (4)  are  intuitive  in  saying  that  the  radiated  power 

increases as the density of the black hole increases.

3.  UTILIZING THE IDEAL GAS LAW INSIDE A BLACK HOLE  

General  relativity  (GR)  is  very  non-linear  inside  the  black  hole  horizon 

where  time  and  space  exchange  roles.    Even  Einstein  stated  his  concerns  about 

black holes,  According to GR, after a sufficiently long time a black hole should 

be  empty  inside  the  horizon,  except  for  a  theoretical  but  not  a  physical  

singularity at its center.   To gain a new  insight into the entropy of black holes, 

let us model a black hole of mass M as a spherical gravitational bottle filled with 

an ideal free gas of N elementary constituents, of average mass m.  This model of 

an ideal gas inside a black hole leads to an equation that agrees remarkably well 

with standard black hole entropy.   At this early stage, it should be judged by its 

results rather than by our judgments about what is inside a black hole. 

     We start with the ideal gas law in terms of the mass density  r

 of the black 

hole

If an estimate is 

made for the collision cross section, the collision frequency of the constituents 

can be calculated from their number density   

r / m  as given by Eq. (10)/m.  From 

the collision frequency one can estimate the time for the black hole to reach 

equilibrium after an interaction with matter or another black hole.

accessible to a system.  According to Sommerfeld (1952)  it was Planck, in 1906, 

that cast Boltzmann's principle in the form of Eq. (12).

6.  DISCUSSION 

In the prevailing point of view, it is not clear what distinct  black hole 

states are being counted by Ns in the expression   Sbh

= k ln N s .  A further 

problem is that since entropy and temperature are statistical quantities dealing 

with many bodies, what does it mean to speak of them with respect to a black 

hole viewed as a single body, which is all that the Schwarzschild solution deals 

with.  A given black hole appears to have only 1 state that is  unconditionally 

characterized by its mass M, angular momentum L, and charge Q.  With 0 = Q = 

L = M, there is no black hole, and Eq. (12) is consistent with SBek since A = 0.  

 0, there would appear to be only 1 state making Eq. (12) = 0, which is

inconsistent if not totally incompatible with SBek which is (cid:181) A „

 0.

The interpretation of this paper with N constituents inside the black hole 

avoids this inconsistency.  Furthermore it permits straightforward exploration of 

the dynamics and time scale by which equilibrium is achieved in terms of the 

internal collision frequency of the constituents.  Though black holes are far from 

being well understood, the general orthodox view is that black hole entropy as 

related to the black hole's area is on a firm and well understood basis.  This 

aspect of black holes has been most diffficult to fathom because it is contrary to 

all other known aspects of the entropy principle where entropy is an extensive 

quantity and the volume of a system makes a major contribution to its entropy.  

We still have much to learn about black holes as they are clandestine about their 

interiors, hiding a theoretical gravitational singularity, but most likely not a real 

physical singularity.   

        Not  only  has  an  equivalent  volume  contribution  for  black  hole  entropy 

been found , but we also found out something about the number of constituents.  

In  a  recent  extensive  review,  Bekenstein  (2003)  examines  the  relationship 

between black hole entropy and information theory.  However, the fundamental 

tenet that black hole entropy is only a function of its area is not questioned.  Two 

biases  have  contributed  to  the  view  that black hole entropy is purely related to 

the area of a black hole.  One is that we can have no knowledge of what is inside 

a black hole.  On the basis of my analysis, I would modify this statement to "no 

direct  knowledge."    The  other  is  an  historical  bias  since  in  their  paper  on  the 

laws  of  thermodynamics  of  black  holes,  Bardeen,  Carter,  and  Hawking  (1973) 

showed that the increase of the area of a black hole is analogous to entropy.   

Black hole temperature is obtained quantum mechanically by means of an 

analysis (Hawking, 1974, 1975) that is unconventional with respect to 

thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.  This makes temperature seem like a 

not well-defined concept for a black hole, without consideration of the 

-9- of 11 

 

 

constituents introduced in this paper.  Temperature is fundamentally a statistical 

concept requiring many bodies.  If the distribution of energies is broad, the 

temperature is high.  If the distribution of energies is narrow, the temperature is 

low.  Temperature is basically a measure of the half-width of the distribution. 

For a black hole it not clear what the distribution is or what the states are for 

determining the entropy.   

 

In their paper on the laws of thermodynamics of black holes, Bardeen, 

Carter, and Hawking (1973) very specifically said that the temperature they 

assigned was not real, but just an effective temperature.  They also were very 

careful to add that for them the real temperature of a black hole is zero.  The 

latter was the basis on which Hawking attacked Bekenstein's concept of black 

hole entropy.  Hawking argued that if a black hole has entropy this implies that 

a black hole has a real temperature greater than 0, and that we all know that the 

temperature of a black hole must be 0.  If a black hole has a real temperature (is 

thermalized), then it must radiate leading to reductio ad aburdum;  but Hawking 

made this his argument before discovering Hawking radiation.   

6.  CONCLUSION 

    

Black hole density led to the simplest possible equation for black hole 

radiation.  Similarly black hole density led to a novel insight into black hole 

entropy.  Black hole entropy may prove to be as malleable as the conservation of 

energy.  Whenever energy conservation was challenged, a way was found to 

preserve it.  It is not clear why my simple model works so well.  For little black 

holes this may be due to asymptotic freedom because the constituents can be at 

extremely high density.   Another possibility is that there are neutralizing effects 

similar to those that permit a free gas model of electrons inside a metal.  

Nevertheless this model addresses and to some degree answers the question of 

why the entropy of a black hole is  directly related to its horizon area, even in the 

 

-10- of 11 

non-equilibrium state.  It says that the black hole area reflects the number and

entropy of the constituents inside it.

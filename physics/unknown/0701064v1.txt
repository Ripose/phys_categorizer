ABSTRACT 
 

Noise  measurement  on 

a  population  of  gearbox 
manufactured in large number often reveals high variability due to 
tolerances  on  each  gear  design  parameter  (manufacturing  errors). 
Gearbox  noise  results  mainly  from  housing  vibration  induced  by 
the  gear  meshing  process.  High  acoustic  levels  correspond  to 
excitation  in  a  resonant  manner  of  some  critical  modes.  All 
gearbox  modes  and  especially  these  critical  modes  depend  on 
tolerances  related  to  gear design parameters through the meshing 
stiffness. 

Tolerances  are  considered  on  shaft  misalignment  errors, 
teeth  profile  errors  and  teeth  longitudinal  errors.  We  introduce 
these  tolerances  as  geometric  random  gaussian  parameters.  The 
critical  modes  are  extracted  using  an  efficient  procedure.  The 
retained  “statistical”  method  to  treat  tolerances  is  the  Taguchi’s 
method. We illustrate this methodology considering two different 
gearbox  dynamic  models  fitted  out  with  a  single  spur  gear. 
Obtained  dispersion  results  are  validated  by  comparison  with 
Monte-Carlo simulations. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 

The  vibratory and acoustical behaviour of gearboxes results 
from numerous sources. Among these, it is generally admitted that 
the  main  source is the static transmission error under load (STE) 
[1].  STE  is  mainly  governed  by  periodic  components  at  the 
meshing  frequency  due  to  (1)  elastic  deflections  of  gear  teeth 
under  load  (periodic  meshing  stiffness)  and  (2)  teeth  geometry 
modifications,  manufacturing  errors  and  shaft  misalignments. 
Under  operating  conditions,  STE  generates  dynamic  mesh  forces 
leading  to  dynamic  forces  and  moments  transmitted  through 
bearings, housing vibration and noise.  

Further,  critical  rotation  speeds  associated  with  high 
dynamic  mesh  forces  and  high  noise  levels,  correspond  to  the 
excitation  of  some  critical  modes  having  a  high  potential  energy 
stored  by  the  meshing  stiffness  [2].  These  critical  speeds  are 
mainly controlled by the time-average meshing stiffness. 

At  last,  considering  gearbox  manufactured  in  large number, 
we  observe  dispersion  of  critical  speeds  and  excitation  levels 
mainly due to variability of STE and meshing stiffness. Sources of 
dispersion  result  mainly  from  geometry  faults  authorised  by 
designers  who  introduce  necessary  tolerances.  We  model  these 
uncertain parameters (geometry faults) by random parameters. 

In  this  context,  the  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  deal  with  some 
results  about  variabilities  of  peak  to  peak  STE,  time-average 
meshing  stiffness  and  critical  speeds.  Two  different  dynamic 
gearboxes  are  investigated  to  show  efficiency  of  used  process. 
Statistics are obtained from Taguchi's method and are compared to 
Monte-Carlo  simulations.  Sources  of  variability  are  teeth  profile 

manufacturing errors, teeth longitudinal manufacturing errors and 
shaft misalignments. 

 

 

 

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF STATISTICAL METHODS 
 
Monte-Carlo method 

Well-known  Monte-Carlo  simulations  are  generally  used  to 
obtain  reference  predictions  in  order  to  test  other  methods. 
Requirement  of  a large number of samples increases strongly the 
computation time. In this study, we used 30000 samples. Further, 
the accuracy is also determined by the selected random generator. 
In order to generate Gaussian variables, we have used a Box and 
Muller algorithm. 

Taguchi’s method 

Taguchi's  method  allows  to  estimate  in  a  very  simple  way 
the statistical moments of a function of multiple random variables 
whose probability densities are known [3]. Statistical moments are 
estimated  from  numerical  integration  of  Gauss  quadrature  type. 
Then,  the  response  function  is  calculated  for  a  relatively  short 
number  of  samples,  judiciously  chosen.  For  each  uncertain 
variable, a number of samples up to three is necessary to take into 
account  the  eventual  non-linear  behaviour  of  the  response 
function. Precision increases rapidly with this number of samples. 
In this study, we used 81 samples to treat four random parameters. 
The  principal  advantages  of  this  method  are  the  ease  of  its 
time. 
numerical 
Unfortunately, Taguchi’s method can’t provide response function 
probability density function (PDF).

FIRST GEARBOX DYNAMIC MODEL 
 

In  this  section,  we  defined  all  the  steps  required  for  the 
computation of critical speeds variability (STE statistics, meshing 
stiffness  statistics,  critical  modes  variability)  and  we  present 
results associated to a simple gearbox dynamic model. 
 
Description of gear teeth geometry 

A  single-stage  involute  spur  gear  has  been  investigated 
(Table 1).  Profile  and  longitudinal  parabolic  teeth  modifications 
are introduced in order to minimize peak to peak STE for a design 
load  equal  to  F=6000 N.  This  gear  geometry  configuration  is 
considered as the deterministic case. 

In this study, tolerance ranges of profile errors, longitudinal 
errors and misalignments are chosen considering the quality class 
7 of the AFNOR French Standard NF E23-006. This quality class 
is often used in industrial applications (gearbox, machine tool,…). 
All  the  geometry  faults  are  assumed  to  be  truncated  gaussian 
parameters.  They  induce  a  gap  between  the  actual  teeth  surfaces 
and  theoretical  teeth  surfaces.  This  gap  is  expressed  by  two 

parameters Hα and Fα governing profile errors and two parameters 
Hβ and Fβ governing longitudinal errors (see Fig. 1). The F symbol 
concerns  quadratic  errors  while  H  symbol  concerns  linear  errors. 
These  four  parameters  are  linear  combination  of  manufacturing 
errors and shaft misalignments. They are also gaussian parameters. 
The two first statistical moments for these parameters are given in 
Table 2.

Statistics of STE 

In order to compute STE time history, it is necessary to solve 
the static equilibrium of gear contact for each angular position of 
the pinion. A cinematic analysis of gear mesh allows to locate the 
line  of  contact  between  teeth.  Equations of static equilibrium are 
generated  from  discretisation  of  theoretical  contact  lines  in  N 
nodes. 

Unknown  variables  are  STE  expressed  as  a  displacement 
∆ along the action line, the (N×1) normal load vector {P} and the 
(N×1)  vector  of  slack  variables  {Y}.  [H]  is  the  (N×N)  non-
diagonal compliance matrix computed by using FEM modelling of 
toothed  wheel.  {I}  is  the  (N×1)  identity  vector  and  {e}  is  the 
(N×1)  vector  of 
teeth 
modifications  and  geometrical  faults.  F  is  the  input  normal  load. 
For  this  example,  we  considered  rigid  wheel  bodies  with  teeth 
geometry  described  above.  We  have  used  a  modified  simplex 
algorithm described in [4] to solve these equations. 

initial  gaps  which  corresponds 

to 

Introducing  manufacturing  tolerances,  we  used  Taguchi's 
method  to  estimate  the  two  first  statistical  moments  of  peak  to 
peak STE ∆pp. The use of pertubation method to treat randomness 
is not adapted because equation (3) introduces non-linearity in the 
equation  system.  Results  are  validated  by  comparison  with  those 
obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations. Results are given in Table 3 
for  input  normal  loads  F=6000 N  and  F=3000 N.  The  standard 
deviation/mean  value  ratio  is  very  high  for  both  loads.  Then,  we 
can  conclude  on  a  high  dispersion  of  dynamic  response  levels. 
Further,  STE  PDF  is  clearly  dissymmetric  (Fig. 2).  Finally,  we 
observe  good  agreement  between  Taguchi's  method  and  Monte-
Carlo simulations.

Statistics of meshing stiffness 

For  each  pinion  angular  position,  the  STE  computation 

allows to estimate the meshing stiffness km as follows : 

km = ∂F/∂∆ 

km ≈ δF /[∆(F+δF) − ∆(F)] 

(5) 

(6) 

Time-average  meshing  stiffness  Km,  which  governs  critical 
speed values, is estimated by averaging km over a meshing period. 
Statistical  moments  of  Km  are  obtained  from  Taguchi's  method 
compared  with  Monte-Carlo  simulations.  Results  for  F=3000 N 
and  F=6000 N  are  given  in  Table 3.  First,  mean  value  of  Km 
depends  strongly  on  the  input  load.  Second,  we  observe  a 
significant  standard  deviation/mean  value  ratio  close  to  7 % 
(respectively 5 %) for F=3000 N (respectively 6000 N) even if this 
ratio is smaller than the one computed for STE. Third, we notice 
good agreement between the two methods. At last, STE and time-
average  meshing  stiffness  are  not  randomly  independent  with  a 
correlation  coefficient  close  to −0.37 for the case F=3000 N. For 
F=6000 N,  this  statistical  correlation  is  close  to  −0.04,  so  that  it 
strongly depends on the input load F. 

 

Gear dynamic model and critical modes 

The dynamic model is displayed on Fig. 3. It corresponds to 
two  rigid  discs  connecting  by  the  meshing  stiffness.  Bearing 
stiffnesses Kb are also introduced. The four degrees-of-freedom of 
this semi-definite elastic system are the two disc displacements Y 
parallel to the action line and the two angular positions θ.

Fig. 3 Dynamic model of the gearbox. 

The four corresponding modes are extracted analytically and 
the detection of the critical ones is done as follows : for each mode 
i, we compute the energetic coefficient defined in equation (7). 

ρi=t{φi}[km]{φi} / t{φi}[K]{φi} 

(7) 

where  {φi}  is  the  ith  eigenvector,  [km]  is  the  stiffness  matrix 
including only the meshing terms and [K] is the complete stiffness 
matrix. The higher ρi is, the more critical the mode is [2]. For this 
dynamic model, only two modes (defined as modes 1 and 3) have 
a significant contribution (ρi≠0). Statistical moments of frequency 
f1 and f3 are given in Table 4. We can notice that the mean value 
of stochastic frequencies is different from the deterministic values 

without  manufacturing  errors.  A  zero  order  Taylor  expansion 
would  not  be  valid.  Second,  the  standard  deviation/mean  value 
ratio can be higher than 2%, so that variability of geometry faults 
has significant effect on critical modes.

Statistical  moments  of  ρi  are  given  in  Table 5.  Energetic 
repartition  between  modes  depends  on  the  input  load.  Standard 
deviations  are  equal  because  summation  of  energetic  coefficients 
for  the  two  modes  must  be  100 %  for  each  sample.  If  one 
energetic  coefficient  decreases, 
increases. 
Eigenfrequencies are well separated so that energetic dispersion is 
quite small, but an energetic crossover between the two modes is 
not excluded, especially for F=3000 N.

Critical rotation speeds and associated ranges 

Critical  speeds  correspond  to  the  excitation  by  STE  of 
critical  modes  such  that  their  eigenfrequencies  correspond  to 
meshing frequency or its harmonics : 

where  n  is  an  integer,  j  represents  the  wheel  (1-input  or  2-
output)  and  i  represents  the  critical  mode  (1  or  3).  For  a  critical

The  critical  speed  ranges  are  obtained  with  Tchebycheff’s 
inequality.  Results  are  displayed  in  Fig. 4  for  the  driven  wheel 
rotation speed (j=2) and the meshing frequency (n=1). According 
to  Tchebycheff,  critical  speed  has  a  minimum  probability  to  be

Gearbox dynamic model and critical modes 

The  gearbox  is  modelled  using  F.E.  method  (Fig. 6).  The 
pinion  and  the  driven  wheel  are  modelled  with  concentrated 
masses  and  rotary  inertia.  A  specific  12×12  stiffness  matrix  is 
introduced  to  couple  the  6  d.o.f.  of  pinion  and  6  d.o.f.  of  driven 
wheel.  This  matrix  is  defined  from  geometric  characteristics  of 
gear and from meshing stiffness previously computed. The shafts 
are  discretized  using  beam  elements  with  two  nodes  and  6  d.o.f 
per  node.  Shaft  radius  are  equal  to  45 mm  and  85 mm.  Distance 
between  bearings  is  equal  to  75 mm.  The  motor  and  the external 
load  are  connected  to  shafts  using  rotary  inertia  and  torsion 
stiffness  elements.  A  10×10  stiffness  matrix  is  introduced  to 
model  tapered  roller  bearings  with  use  of  a  method  described  in 
[6]. This gearbox model contains 40 elements and 200 d.o.f..

SECOND GEARBOX DYNAMIC MODEL 
 
Statistics of meshing stiffness 

The computational method of meshing stiffness is described 
above.  New  spur  gear  model  is  introduced  and  consists  on  thin-
rimmed  wheels  with  the  teeth  geometry  described  in  the  first 
section.  The  computed  compliance  matrix  [H]  is  considerably 
affected  [5].  Considering  the  same  profile  and  longitudinal 
parabolic  teeth  modifications,  the  optimal  design  load  is  close to 
F=3000 N.  Deterministic  value  of  time-average  meshing stiffness 
is then Km=252 N/µm. 

Monte-Carlo  simulations  with  statistical  moments  given  in 
Table  2,  lead  to  a  density  probability  function  (PDF)  of  Km 
displayed  in  Fig. 5.  A  theoretical  gaussian  PDF  with  computed 
first  statistical  moments  (see  Table 6)  is  also  displayed.  Meshing 
stiffness  PDF  may  be  approximated  by  a  gaussian  PDF,  but  the 
extension of this assumption to other input loads had to be proved. 
At last, Taguchi’s method provides results very close to the ones 
obtained with Monte-Carlo simulations.

Three critical modes are identified (7th, 10th and 12th modes). 
critical  frequency  variability  is  not  high.  The  Taguchi’s  method 
gives  accurate  results  close  the  ones  provided  by  Monte-Carlo 
simulations  excepted  for  two  neighbours  modes  (7th  and  8th 
modes).  Contrary  to  the  deterministic  case,  mean  value  of  7th 
critical natural frequency is higher than mean value of 8th natural 
frequency.  An  energetic  cross-over  and  a  frequency  cross-over 
between modes are observed. Standard deviation of (ρi) is higher 
than  its  mean  value  for  7th  mode.  Taguchi’s  method  does  not 
provide accurate results in this particular case.  

Critical speed ranges 

For  input  speed  varying  from  0  to  5000 rpm,  critical  speed 
ranges  are  obtained  from  Tchebycheff’s  inequality  and  displayed 
on  Fig. 7.  According  to  Tchebycheff,  critical  input  speed  has  a 
minimum  probability  to  be  inside  ranges  equal  to  96%  for  each 
manufactured  gearbox.  They  correspond  to  excitation  in  a 
resonant manner of 7th and 10th modes by the meshing frequency 
(n=1)  and  at  its  first  harmonic  (n=2).  Range’s  length  is  about 
200 rpm for the 7th and the 10th modes.

Fig. 7 Two main critical input speed ranges (r.p.m.) for excitation 
at meshing frequency (n=1) and at first harmonic (n=2). 

As a confirmation of these predicted critical ranges, we show 
one  dynamic  response  obtained  for  a  possible  teeth  geometry 
configuration  (Fig. 8).  This  dynamic  response  is  obtained  after 
solving  the  gearbox  differential  motion  equation  with  a  spectral 
and iterative method [7]. 

It corresponds to dynamic meshing force  versus input speed. 
Main resonant phenomena are observed for input speeds close to 

3000 rpm  and  4000 rpm.  Other  secondary  phenomena  are 
observed for input speeds close to 2000 rpm and 1500 rpm. They 
are due to excitation of critical modes by the second harmonic of 
meshing  frequency.  All  these  rotation  speeds  are  included  in  the 
predicted critical ranges.

CONCLUSION 

 
For  gearbox  manufactured  in  large  number,  we  have 
the  stochastic 
quantified  excitation 
levels  dispersion  and 
frequency  ranges  where  resonant  phenomena  may  occur.  The 
dispersion  values  show  that  it  is  necessary  to  control  gear-
manufacturing  tolerances  to  reduce  mean  value  of  radiated  noise 
as well as its variability.

The  statistical  Taguchi’s  method  offers  a  powerful  and 
simple 
treating  gear  dynamical  behaviour  with 
manufacturing tolerances. In most of treated cases, the prediction 
of  statistical  moments  is  close  to  the  ones  given  by Monte-Carlo 
simulationss. The computation time required by Taguchi’s method 
is  300  times  smaller  than  the  one  required  for  Monte-Carlo 
simulation  with  30000  samples.  This  methodology  had  to  be 
applied on more complex systems having a lot of energetic modes.

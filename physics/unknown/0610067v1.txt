We study the case of two rockets which meet at a point O of an “inertial” co-ordinate 
system  S,  and  move  symmetrically  toward  two  targets  A  and  B  placed  at  equal 
distances  of  point  O.  At  the  instant  they  meet,  the  clocks  inside  the  rockets  are 
synchronized.  This  question  which  was  tackled  in  ref  [1]  is  studied  here  in  depth. 
Assuming the existence of a preferred aether frame S0 and the anisotropy of the one-
way  speed  of  light  in  the  other  frames,  we  show  that  if  the  speed  of  the  rockets  is 
determined exactly, the clocks inside the rockets will display different readings when 
they reach points A and B in contradiction with the relativity principle. Conversely, if 
the determination of the speed of the rockets is made with clocks placed at A and B 
synchronized  by  means  of  the  Einstein-Poincaré  procedure,  the  clocks  inside  the 
rockets  will  display  the  same  reading,  a  fact  which  seems  in  agreement  with  the 
relativity principle. But this synchronization procedure presupposes the invariance of 
the  one-way  speed  of  light,  in  contradiction  with  the  assumptions  made,  and, 
therefore,  introduces  an  error  in  the  measurements.  This  demonstrates  that  if  we 
assume the existence of an aether frame, the relativity principle is not a fundamental 
principle; it depends on an arbitrary synchronization procedure. In any case, this is an 
example  of  an  experimental  measurement  which  can  be  explained  by  aether  theory 
without the assumption of the invariance of the one-way speed of light in all inertial 
frames. 

 
 

 

 

A number of arguments today lend support to the existence of a preferred aether frame [1] and 
to  the  anisotropy  of  the  one-way  speed  of  light  in  the  other  frames,  and  it  is  of  the  utmost 
importance to know whether such a preferred frame is compatible with the application of the 
relativity  principle  in  the  physical  world.  Physicists  remain  divided  about  this  question. 
Einstein was convinced that the existence of a preferred frame is at variance with relativity. In 
the  original  formulation  of  his  theory  [2],  he  definitely  regarded  the  existence  of  aether  as 
superfluous. Later he changed his mind in order to formulate the theory of general relativity. 
But,  the  aether  of  Einstein  is  not  associated  with  a  preferred  frame.  In  his  little  book 
“Sidelights on relativity” [3], he expressed his views in the following terms:  
 

“..according to the theory of general relativity, space is endowed with  physical qualities. In this sense, 
therefore there exists an aether… But this aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality of 
ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may 
not be applied to it”. 

 
On the contrary, Poincaré acknowledged the Lorentz assumptions which assume the existence 
of  a  preferred  aether  frame,  and  in  which  length  contraction  and  clock  retardation  are  real 
processes depending on the velocity of the rods and clocks relative to the aether frame. The 
agreement of Poincaré with the approach of Lorentz is expressed in the following sentence: 
 

“The  results  I  have  obtained  agree  with  those  of  Mr.  Lorentz  in  all  important  points.  I  was  led  to 
complete and modify them in a few points of detail” [4].

 His belief in the aether was expressed in the citations that follow: 
 

Does an aether really exist? The reason why we believe in an aether is simple. If light comes from a 
distant star and takes many years to reach us, it is (during its travel) no longer on the star, but not yet 
near the earth. Nevertheless, it must be somewhere and supported by a material medium; (La science et 
l’hypothèse chapter 10 p 180 of the French edition “Les theories de la physique moderne”.) [5] 

“Let us remark that an isolated electron moving through the aether, generates an electric current, that is 
to say an electromagnetic field. This field corresponds to a certain quantity of energy localized in the 
aether rather than in the electron” [6]. 

 
But, at the same time, Poincaré acknowledged the relativity principle, as the following 
sentence shows: 
 

“It  seems  that  the  impossibility  of  observing  the  absolute  motion  of  the  Earth  is  a  general  law  of 
nature.  We  are  naturally  inclined  to  admit  this  law  that  we  shall  call  the  relativity  postulate,  and  to 
admit it without restriction” [7]. 

 
In this text, we propose to check these different opinions starting from a simple experimental 
test. 
Let us consider two rockets moving uniformly in opposite directions along a straight line. At 
the initial instant (0) the rockets meet at a point O of an ‘inertial’ co-ordinate system S, before 
continuing their transit, at speed v, toward two points A and B placed at equal distances from 
point  O.  At  the  instant  they  meet,  the  clocks inside  the rockets are synchronized. When the 
rockets reach points A and B, these clocks are stopped and then compared. (Note that during a 
short time the Earth frame can be seen as almost inertial and, therefore, the co-ordinate system 
S can be chosen in the Earth frame) 
According  to  Einstein’s  special  relativity,  the  clocks  should  display  the  same  reading  when 
they stop; indeed, since Einstein’s special relativity does not acknowledge the existence of a 
preferred aether frame, there is a complete symmetry between the two clocks.  
According to Poincaré’s theory, as we have seen, there is no assumed incompatibility between 
the existence of a privilege frame and the principle of relativity. Is this really the case? This 
test will enable us to answer this question. (Let us bear in mind that, in aether theory, clock 
retardation is defined with respect to the privileged aether frame which is represented here by 
the co-ordinate system ).

The problem must be envisaged successively from two different points of view.

1. The first point of view assumes that one can exactly measure the speeds of the rockets. 
 
This  implies  that  one  can  determine  exactly  the  time  needed  by  the  rockets  to  move  from 
point O to points A and B. The problem is made difficult because, in order to do so, we must 
synchronize two clocks placed at points A and B with another placed at point O, but we know 
that synchronizing clocks exactly is not an easy process [8]. Yet, an accurate synchronization 
is  not  impossible  knowing  that  different  experiments  and  astronomical  observations  have 
permitted estimation of the absolute speed of the Earth frame and, therefore, of the magnitude 
of  the  one-way  speed  of  light  [1].  Most  probably,  in  the  near  future,  a  more  accurate 
determination of this speed will enable us to synchronize the clocks almost exactly.  
In any case an exact synchronisation can be assumed. 
Let us therefore first suppose, for our purpose, that this exact synchronization of clocks has 
been carried out. 
Assuming  in  agreement  with  aether  theory  that  clock  retardation  results  from  the  motion  of 
the rockets with respect to the aether frame, the resolution of the problem is easy. Insofar as 
the rockets do not have the same speed with respect to the aether frame, the slowing down of 
their clocks will be different, and they will display different readings. (Only if the co-ordinate 
system  S  was  at  rest  with  respect  to  the  aether  frame,  the  clocks  inside  the  vehicles  would 
display the same reading). Of course, this would inform us whether S is at rest or in motion 
relative to
, and the absolute motion of the Earth could be estimated in contradiction with 
the principle of relativity.  
Therefore  Poincaré’s  relativity  principle  is  shown  to  be  at  variance  with  the  existence  of  a 
preferred aether frame. 
 
2. We shall now study what happens when the transit time of the rockets is measured, in the 
co-ordinate  system  S,  with  clocks  synchronized  by  means  of  the  usual  Einstein-Poincaré 
procedure.  
In  order  to  synchronize  the  clocks  placed  at  A  and  B,  we  shall  make  use  of  the  Einstein-
Poincaré synchronization procedure which  assumes that the speed of light is isotropic in  all 
inertial frames. To this end, we send a light signal at time  = 0 from clock O to clock A (or 
B).  After  reflection,  the  signal  returns  to  O.  The  clock  is  supposed  to  be  synchronous  with 
clock O if, at the instant of reflection, it displays the reading t = T/2, where T is the reading 
displayed by clock O at the instant when the signal comes back to it.  
Insofar as the one-way speed of light is not isotropic in co-ordinate systems which are not at 
rest with respect to the aether frame, this method introduces an error that must be corrected, as 
we shall see below. 
For convenience, we shall assume that the segment AB is aligned and moves along the x-axis 
of the co-ordinate system  which is at rest with respect to the aether frame. Let us refer to 
the length of the segment when it is at rest in the aether frame as 2 . Since it is moving with 

l
respect to the aether frame at speed v, half of its length will measure
Actually, according to aether theory, the real speed of light relative to the co-ordinate system 
S along the direction A(cid:198)B is equal to C – v, and in the opposite direction to C + v. Although 
the  magnitude  of  v  is  not  exactly  known,  this  assumption  will  be  helpful  for  our  purpose. 
(These formulas were the expressions used by Lorentz to explain the Michelson experiment. 
As  we  have  seen  in  ref  [1],  only  speeds  whose  measurements  are  altered  by  the  systematic 
measurement distortions obey the relativistic law of composition of velocities). 
The real time needed by the light signal to travel from point O to point B is therefore:

is the time that a clock not slowed down by motion and exactly synchronized with clock O

would display when the signal which starts at instant zero from point O reaches point B.  
Taking  account  of  clock  retardation  in  S,  the  clock  reading  in  the  absence  of  synchronism

With  clocks  not  slowed  down  by  motion,  the  apparent  time  needed  by  the  light  signal  to 
travel from point O to point B would be:

(this apparent time is equal to t = T/2 as we have seen above) 
(We can see that, contrary to special relativity, aether theory does not consider the ratio 
as the real time of light transit from O to B). 
Thus, taking account of clock retardation in S, the synchronism discrepancy of clock B with 
respect to clock O is:

It is the time that a clock not slowed by motion and exactly synchronized with clock O would

synchronization procedure, the reading displayed by clock A would be:

We note that, contrary to clock B the apparent time given by clock A is longer than the real 
time. 
 
Let us now study the effect of the synchronism discrepancy on the clocks placed inside the 
rockets. 
In  the  experiment,  the  apparent  speeds  of  the  rockets  relative  to  point  O,  measured  by  an 
observer  at  rest  in  frame  S  using  the  Einstein-Poincaré  synchronization  procedure,  are 
identical by definition; therefore, when the rockets reach points A and B, the clocks placed at 
A and B will display the same readingτ. But due to the synchronism discrepancy effect this 
reading  is  erroneous  and  must  be  corrected  and,  as  we  shall  see  in  the  following  pages,  the 
real speeds of the rockets are in fact different. 
In fact, in the absence of synchronism error, the reading of clock B would have been: 

Let  us  now  determine  the  real  transit  times 
attached to frame  when the rockets reach points A and B. We have:

3. Conclusion 
This result is very enlightening. It demonstrates that, if the measurement of the speeds of the 
rockets  by  the  observer  at  rest  in  S  was  exactly  determined,  the  clocks  inside  the  rockets 
would  display  different  times  when  they  reach  points  A  and  B.  Therefore  the  relativity 
principle does not apply with real speeds. 
Conversely,  if  one  uses  the  Einstein-Poincaré  procedure  in  S  to  determine  the  transit  times 
(and therefore the speeds) of the rockets, then the clocks inside the rockets display the same 
reading.  This  result  is  due  to  the  systematic  error  made  when,  assuming  the  isotropy  of  the 
one-way  speed  of  light,  one  trusts  this  synchronization  procedure  with  light  signals.  We 
should  note  that  the  same  conclusions  can  be  drawn  with  the  slow  clock  transport 
synchronization procedure, which has been shown by several authors to be equivalent to the 
method proposed by Poincaré and Einstein [8]. 
Therefore,  assuming  the  existence  of  a  preferred  aether  frame,  we  show  that  the  relativity 
principle  is  not  a  fundamental  postulate  of  physics;  it  depends  on  arbitrary  synchronization 
procedures.   
We  emphasize  that,  although  the  use  of  the  synchronization  procedures  mentioned  above 
make  sure  that  the  clocks  inside  the  rockets  will  display  the  same  reading  when  they  reach 
points A and B, in agreement with what special relativity asserts, the interpretation of this fact 
by  aether  theory  is  completely  different.  In  particular,  this  result  has  been  obtained  without 
assuming the isotropy of the one-way speed of light in the co-ordinate system S, a fact which 
should result in significant consequences for the understanding of physics.

In addition to the ponderomotive acceleration of highly relativistic electrons at interaction of very 
short  and  very  intense  laser  pulses,  a  further  acceleration  is  derived  from  the  interaction  of  these 
electron beams with the spontaneous magnetic fields of about 100 MG. This additional acceleration is 
the  result  of  a  laser-magnetic  resonance  acceleration  (LMRA)[1]  around  the  peak  of  the  azimuthal 
magnetic field. This causes the electrons to gain energy within a laser period. Using a Gaussian laser 
pulse, the  LMRA acceleration of  the  electrons  depends on  the  laser polarization. Since  this is  in  the 
resonance  regime,  the  strong  magnetic  fields  affect  the  electron  acceleration  considerably.  The 
mechanism results in good collimated high energetic electrons propagating along the center axis of the 
laser beam as has been observed by experiments and is reproduced by our numerical simulations.

1. INTRODUCTION 

plasma 

The use of very short laser pulses of picosecond or less duration with intensities of TW 
and up of PW and beyond arrived of a new category of interactions. The phenomena to 
be discussed now are polarization dependence effects[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], deviations of 
the generated plasmas from nearly space charge neutralization as in the earlier cases, and 
in  relativistic  effects.  The  earlier  observed  cases  could  mostly  be  described  by  space 
self 
neutralized 
focusing[11,12,13,14,15]  generated  ions  of  several100 MeV energy  because  the  Debye 
lengths involved were sufficiently short and the internal electric fields[16] were not yet of 
dominating  influence.  The  acceleration  of  free  electrons  by  laser  fields  was  well 
in  some  agreement  with  ps-TW 
discussed  separately  [15,17,18]  and  resulted 
measurements[19].  Nevertheless  very  high  density  relativistic  electron  beams  were 
measured  recently  which  resulted  in  a  new  situation  where  relativistic  self-focusing, 
plasma motion, and the beam generation described by particle-in-cell (PIC) methods [10] 
were covering the phenomena not completely depending on each situation.

The generation of extremely high magnetic fields in laser-produced plasmas [20] was 
known  since  a  long  time  but  there  is  a  basically  new  situation  with  the  very  intense 
relativistic electron beams and their mutual interaction with the very high magnetic fields.             
We  present  here  studies  of  these  interactions  of  the  electron-beams  with  the  magnetic 
fields as a basic new laser-magnetic resonance acceleration (LMRA)  mechanism  which 
results in a kind of pinch effect with a high degree of collimation of the electron beams. 
As  the  fast-ignitor  (FI)  concept[21]  for  inertial  confinement  fusion  relies  on  many  new

phenomena  such  as  explosive  channel  formation[22]  and  self-generated  huge  magnetic 
field[20],  much  interest  in  ultraintense  laser-plasma  interaction  studies  appeared.  More 
interestingly,  the  gigagause  self-generated  azimuthal  magnetic  field  has  been  observed 
recently[9].   

We  found  that  two  different  fast  electrons  exist  in  the  presence  of  self-generated 
azimuthal magnetic field. Two sources of multi-MeV electrons are distinguished from the 
relativistic laser-plasma interaction. The first is that the electron acceleration depends on 
the laser intensity, known as the pondermotive acceleration [17,16,18,19]. The second is 
that, around the peak of azimuthal magnetic field, LMRA partly occurs which causes the 
electron  to  gain  energy  from  the  ratio  between  electron  Larmor  frequency  and  laser 
frequency within one laser period[23]. If we consider a linearly polarized (LP) laser pulse, 
the  LMRA  results  in  a  dependence  of  the  laser  accelerated  electrons  on  the  laser 
polarization.  Because  in  the  resonance  regime,  the  strong  magnetic  field  affects  the 
electron  acceleration  dramatically.  Only  just  from  the  second  source,  polarization 
dependence  of  electron  is  appeared.  In  our  knowledge,  these  different  sources  of  fast 
electrons  are  mentioned  for  the  first  time.  This  clears  up  many  experiments  and  PIC 
simulations which are related with polarization dependence phenomena. 

A  fully  relativistic  single  particle  code  is  developed  to  investigate  the  dynamical 
properties  of  the  energetic  electrons.  The  single  test  electron  model  is  a  simple  but 
effective  one.  It  has  been  used  to  analyze  the  direct  laser  acceleration  of  relativistic 
electrons  in  plasma  channels,  e.  g.  M.Schmitz  et  al.[24]  have  analyzed  the  LP  laser 
system  with  self-generated  static  electric  field  and  discussed  the  electron  resonant 
acceleration  mechanism.  K.P.Singh[25]  found  that  resonance  occurs  between  the 
electrons  and  electric  field  of  the  laser  pulse.  We  find  a  big  difference  between  the 
pondermotive  acceleration  and  LMRA  mechanism  in  this  paper.  We  discuss  LMRA 
mechanism of electrons  in  strong  LP laser pulse  and self-generated  azimuthal magnetic 
field. In our simulation, the laser field is a Gaussian profile and the quasistatic magnetic 
field  is  in  a  circle  profile  which  lies  on  the  laser  intensity  and  as  a  function  of  circle 
radius. Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, we describe the dynamical behavior 
of relativistic electrons in a combined LP laser and quasistatic azimuthal magnetic field 
numerically. Two regimes (the peak of laser and the peak of quasistatic magnetic field) 
090   turned  from  the 
and  two  typical  directions  (in  polarization  direction  and 
polarization  direction)  are  discussed.  We  also  show  an  approximate  analytical  equation 
which  provides  a  full  understanding  of  the  LMRA  mechanism  for  comparison.  The 
numerical results clearly demonstrate that LMRA partly occurs within one laser period. 
Our discussion and conclusion are given in Sec.III.

electric field can be ignored.

variations  of  the  ponderomative  force  exerted  by  the  laser  on  the  plasma  electrons.  In

circularly  polarized  laser  and  an  axial  static  magnetic  field,  it  indicates  the  resonance 
between the laser field and the magnetic field. Because the energy Eq.(9) is independence 
on time, we use it to explain what drives the energy of electron to high energy along the 
strong  magnetic  field presence. That is when the  LMRA occurs or partly occurs within 
laser period, the electron will gain energy from the near resonance point (singularity) at a 
negative  bθ( ω≈ ). The electron acceleration depends not only on the laser intensity, but 
also on the ratio between electron Larmor frequency and laser frequency.

self-generated azimuthal magnetic field presence, things will be changed. When  a   and

max
LMRA mechanism can partly occur and give chance to let electron rest in one phase of 
the laser for a while. This relatively rest makes the electron in a slowly motion and gain 
energy  from  the  laser  field.  The  efficiency  of  energy  transfer  will  be  high.  This  is  the 
laser-magnetic  resonance  acceleration.  It's  very  different  from  the  pondermotive 
acceleration  which  does  not  concern  the  laser  period.  In  our  profile  of  θb ,  a  lower 
component quassistatic magnetic field exists in the center regime. So the electron energy 
gain  is  high  than  the  ponderomotive  acceleration  energy.  Anyway  in  this  regime 
(  r λ≤   ) ponderomotive acceleration is in dominant and polarization independence still 
remain.

dependent appears which shows in Fig.3. Because of the different initial position in or not 
in  polarization  direction,  the  electron  has  different  chance  to  utilize  quiver  energy  and 
make LMRA to occur.

Our simulations satisfy with the phenomena which have been reported by experiments 
and  numerical  simulations  e.g.  [4,5,6,7,10].  For  example  in  Ref.[4]  authors  pointed  out 
that a narrow plasma jet is formed at the rear surface which is consistent with a beam of 
fast electrons traveling through the target, collimated by a magnetic field in the target. In 
Ref.[5] L.Gremillet et al. observed two narrow long jets originating from the focal spot. 
These may be caused by the  θb   in the second region. Even the  θb   has more than one 
peak, more electron jets can be produced. As given in Ref.6 the snake like electron orbit 
is very similar to our Fig.2(a), (b) and Fig. 3(a). If the amplitude of  a   and  θb   can be 
comparable,  an elliptical heating area  appears, such as pointed out  by  Kodama et al. in 
experiment  [7].  In  Ref.[10]  A.  Pukhov  et  al.  pointed  out  that  distribution  of  electron 
current  J   and  quasistatic  magnetic  field  B   at  the  positions  of  tight  focusing  is 
elongated in the direction of polarization and heavy  relativistic electrons sprayed in the 
direction of polarization. From above analysis, the polarization dependence of LP system 
is  a  typical  different  feature  with  a  circularly  polarized  (CP)  system  when  the 
self-generated azimuthal magnetic fields are present.. 
IV. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 

Using a single test electron model, we study the energetic electrons in combined strong 
azimuthal magnetic field and Gaussian profile linearly polarized laser field numerically. 
Two different source of fast electron are distinguished. In the presence of magnetic field 
in  LP  system,  polarization  independence  is  being  modified  by  the  increasing  value  of 
magnetic  field.  If  the  laser  intense  is  in  dominant,  the  polarization  dependence  is  not 
evident, If the value of magnetic field becomes comparable with the laser intensity, the 
polarization dependent appears. Comparing with  an energy analytic solution of electron

which contains the laser-magnetic resonance  acceleration mechanism, we point out that 
strong quasistatic magnetic field affect electron acceleration dramatically  from the ratio 
between  the  Larmor  frequency  and  the  laser  frequency.  As  the  ratio  approaches  unity, 
clear  resonance  peaks  are  observed.  From  the  physical  parameters  available  for 
laboratory  experiments,  we  find  that  the  electron  acceleration  depends  not  only  on  the 
laser  intensity,  but  also  on  the  ratio  between  electron  Larmor  frequency  and  the  laser 
frequency.  The  different  fast  electrons  which  produce  by  LMRA  and  pondermotive 
acceleration mechanism give an clear explain of the polarization dependent phenomena. 
Because  the  LMRA  relates  with  laser  period,  an  averaged  calculation  over  one  laser 
period will lost the effect of  θb .    This is different from the pondermotive acceleration 
mechanism. 

For the study of relativistic strong laser pulse along with a hundreds of MG azimuthal 
quassistatic magnetic field is a complex process, related with several mechanisms. In this 
paper we simply treat the laser pulse in channel and the quassistatic magnetic fields, even 
not  consider  the  energetic  electrons  interact  with  and  are  deflected  by  background 
particles. Our purpose is to make clear how the fast electron behavior in the presence of a 
magnetic field. For the polarization dependent phenomena only appears in LP laser case, 
whereas  the  CP  laser  case  hasn't,  so  the  efficiency  of  energy  transfer  will  be  different. 
The  value  in  CP  case  is  higher  than  in  LP  case.  For  the  quassistatic  magnetic  field 
modifying the polarization independence is very important in laser-plasma interactions, it 
will have good application in fast-ignitor scheme and particle accelerators.

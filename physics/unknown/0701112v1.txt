The  contribution  of  the  “rapid”  part  of  the  pressure  diffusion  to  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy 

balance  is  analyzed,  and  a  new  model  to  describe  its  effect  is  suggested.  A  new  transport 

equation  for  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  is  derived.  The  new  k-equation  does  not  require  any 

modification in the standard ε-equation. A new k-ε model, which includes the new k-equation and 

the standard ε-equation, is validated in four separated flows: a planar diffuser, over a backstep, in 

a channel with wavy walls, and in an axisymmetric combustion chamber. It is shown that a new 

model  reproduces  the  mean  velocity,  shear  stress,  and  turbulent  kinetic  energy  profiles  and  the 

skin friction coefficient in very good agreement with experimental data

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

Two-equation turbulence models (Jones and Launder1; Launder and Sharma2) are widely 

used  in  industrial  CFD  applications  although  their  shortcomings  are  well  known.  Among  these 

shortcomings  are  i)  the  limitations  of  the  linear  eddy  viscosity  assumption,  or  Boussinesq 

approximation, as a representation of the  Reynolds stresses  and  ii)  the  difficulties  in forming a 

transport equation for the length-scale determining quantity needed to build the eddy viscosity. 
Both questions have been thoroughly investigated in, e.g., Cousteix and Aupoix3 and Apsley and 
Leschziner4.  Rather  than  questioning  either  of  these  points,  the  current  paper  focuses  on  the 

adequacy of the standard model transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy k

make  any  contribution  to  the  exact  transport  equation  for  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy.  In 

inhomogeneous  turbulent  flows,  however,  there  is  a  contribution  of  the  pressure-diffusion  term

from  free  shear  flows  (Rogers  and  Moser5,  Moser  et  al.6)  show  that  the  contribution  of  the 

pressure  diffusion  to  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  balance  is  not  negligible,  especially  in  the 

central  core  of  these  flows.  These  data  also  show  that  modeling  the  pressure  diffusion  and 

turbulent  diffusion  terms  together  is  not  likely to be successful because they have  qualitatively 
different  profiles  (see  Fig.  21  in  Rogers  and  Moser5  and  Fig.  12  in  Moser  et  al.6).  In  fact,  the

(Lumley7).  In  (2),  ρ  is  the  density  and 

∂ <

> ∂   is  the  turbulent  diffusion.  Thus,  the 

“rapid” pressure-diffusion term does not appear in equation (1) and requires modeling.  

Evidence  that  important  information  is  missing  in  equation  (1)  is  that  two-equation 

models  employing  this  equation  can  generally  reproduce  the  mean  velocity  and  shear  stress 

profiles accurately, but the turbulent kinetic energy level is not well predicted, even in the central 
core  of  free  shear  flows  (Poroseva8;  Poroseva  and  Bézard9)  where  wall  effects  are  irrelevant. 

Notice  also  that  the  transport  equation  for  the  dissipation  ε  (or  any  other  second  scale)  is 

formally derived from the k-equation. Therefore, any physics missing in the k-equation causes the 

loss of accuracy in describing the second scale transport regardless the choice for this scale.  

It was shown by Poroseva8 that the turbulent kinetic energy level could be corrected if the 

“rapid” part of the pressure diffusion term (related to the mean velocity gradients) is included in 

the  k-equation  as  an  extra  term  related  to  the  production  P.  The  contribution  of  the  pressure 

diffusion  to  the  transport  equation  for  ε  (ε-equation)  appears  through  one  of  the  modeling 

coefficients in the  ε-equation. A two-equation model with the new k-equation was validated in 
Poroseva8 in self-similar free shear flows (plane wake, plane mixing layer, plane and round jets) 

and  equilibrium  boundary  layers  with  and  without  pressure  gradients.  The  objective  of  the 

current paper is to investigate further potential of the model in application to simulations of the 

separated  flows  in  a  planar  diffuser,  over  a  backstep,  in  a  channel  with  wavy  walls,  and  in  an 

axisymmetric combustion chamber (Fig. 1). 

II. MODELING THE PRESSURE DIFFUSION  

Excluding  from  the  consideration  a  flow  area  very  close  to  the  flow  boundary,  the 

pressure diffusion correlation in the exact transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy can

be presented as a sum of “rapid” and “slow” parts

(Chou10).  The  second  term  on  the  right  hand  side  of  (3)  can  be  modeled  by  expression  (2)  as 

discussed  above.  Therefore,  its  contribution  in  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  balance  is  absorbed 

by an adopted model for the turbulent diffusion. The first term on the right hand side of (3)  is 

called  the “rapid” part due to its relation to the mean velocity gradient. A model for this term

In expression (7), 

ijδ  is the Kronecker symbol; the model coefficients 

1C

 and 

2C

 are generally 

(6) and  (7) is described in 
unknown  functions  of  several  parameters. Derivation of expressions 
detail  in  Poroseva11.  Notice  that  these  expressions  are  derived  without  the  assumption  of 

homogeneity.   

In the transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy, expression (6) with  model (7) 

for the tensor function 

nmjia

 contracts to 

(4), where

In general, the coefficient 

 is a function of the same parameters as the coefficients 

kC

1C

 and 

2C

. 

In homogeneous turbulence, however, the coefficients 

1C

 and 

2C

 are linked:

(Poroseva11). Substitution of (9) in expression (8) yields the universal constant value of 

kC

 equal 

to  0 6 . That is, in homogeneous turbulence, the pressure diffusion term does not contribute to the 

.

turbulent kinetic energy balance as expected. 

It  should  be  pointed  out  that  model  expression  (4)  for  the  “rapid”  part  of  the  pressure

diffusion  is  similar  to  the  model  derived  ad  hoc  by  Demuren  et  al.12  by  analyzing  direct 

numerical simulation (DNS) data. 

 

An important question in modeling 

iu p<

should  be  of  the  diffusive  type.  In  regard  to  the  “rapid”  part  of  the  correlation 

u p<

  (see 

expression 

(5)), there is no indication that the model for this term should be of the diffusive type. 

What  “diffusive  type”  requires  is  that  the  integral  of  the  sum  of  three  correlations 

u p<
i

i
,

(

i

)  taken  over  the  entire  flow  volume  vanishes.  It  does  not  imply  that  the  sum  of  three 

correlations

 vanishes at every point in the flow, or that any one of

 vanishes throughout the flow. This requirement does not also imply that each of the 

terms  in  expression 

(3)  (which  in  its  complete  form  includes  boundary  effects)  would  vanish 

separately.  Finally,  even  assuming  that  the  integral  of  (4)  taken  over  the  entire  flow  volume 

should vanish, one can argue that this result can be achieved with different functional forms of 

the coefficient 

kC

, not necessarily of the diffusive type. (More discussion on a functional form of 

the model coefficients is provided in Section IV.) This question clearly requires more study in the 

future.  Notice,  however,  that  expressions 

(4)  and  (7)  hold  regardless  of  the  models  for  the 

coefficients

1C

, 

2C

, and 

kC

.  

III. TURBULENCE MODEL 

 

 

Using  model  expression  (4)  for  the  “rapid”  part  of  the  pressure  diffusion,  one  obtains  a 

new model equation for the turbulent kinetic energy transport:

where 

1Cε , 

2Cε ,  and  εσ   are  model  coefficients.  The  effect  of  the  “rapid”  part  of  the  pressure 

diffusion  comes  from  the  coefficient 

1Cε ,  which  generally  should  be  a  function  of  the  same 

parameters as the coefficient 

. However, since a functional form is currently unavailable for 

kC

both  coefficients,  we  approximate  them  in  this  study  by  constant  values  and  then,  investigate 

whether this approximation results in improvement of simulation results.  

Indeed,  if  one  allows  the  coefficient 

1Cε   being  constant  in  any  given  flow,  but  variable 

from flow to flow, even the standard  k ε−  model (equations (1) and (11)) reproduces the mean 

velocity and shear stress profiles in a good agreement with experimental data in free shear flows 
and equilibrium boundary layers under different pressure gradients (Poroseva and Bézard9). The 

results of simulations obtained with 

1Cε  variable from flow to flow (see Table 2 in Poroseva and 

Bézard9) and the rest of the coefficients given by

are  better  than  the  results  obtained  with  the  k-ω  (Wilcox13)  and  k-ϕ  (Cousteix  et  al.14)  models. 

However,  the  axis  level  of  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  is  either  overestimated  (plane  wake)  or 

underestimated  (plane  jet,  mixing  layer,  boundary  layers).  Only  in  the  round  jet,  the  turbulent 

kinetic energy level is reproduced correctly with

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  same  value

homogeneous flows also (Kassinos et al.15). 

Allowing the coefficient

kC

  and 

1Cε   vary  from  flow  to  flow  as  shown  in  Table  1,  one  can  reproduce  well  not  only  the 

mean  velocity  and  shear  stress  profiles,  but  also  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  level  in  the  plane 

wake,  the  plane  jet,  and  the  mixing  layer,  as  well  as  in  the  equilibrium  boundary  layers 
(Poroseva8).

in  a  channel  with  wavy  walls,  and  in  an  axisymmetric  combustion  chamber  (Fig.  1).  We  will 

denote this model as LS-RPD. The performance of the LS-RPD model will be compared with the 
performance  of  the  standard  k ε−   model  (Launder  and  Sharma2).  This  model  (hereinafter 

referred  as  LS)  includes  equations  (1)  and  (11),  with  the  model  coefficients  being  set  to  their

.  Results  obtained 

using the four-equation

 model (Durbin

16) are also included for comparison. 

Equations  (1),  (10),  and  (11)  are  written  in  the  high  Reynolds  number  form.  Since, 

modeling wall effects (or low Reynolds number effects) is not in the focus of the current paper, 
the standard damping function approach proposed by Launder and Sharma2 is used to correct the 

behavior of turbulent quantities in the viscous dominated near-wall regions. Steady equations are 

solved using the commercial code Fluent. 

 

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The  first  problem  selected  is  the  backstep  flow  (Jovic  and  Driver17)  shown  in  Fig.1(a). 

The Reynolds number based on the inlet velocity (

) and the step height (H) is 5,100. The flow 

iu

at the inlet is a fully developed boundary layer. Separation is fixed at the step and the expansion 

generates  a  large  recirculating  region  with  strong  negative  velocity  and  high  turbulent  kinetic 

energy (measurements are available at several stations downstream the step). The coefficients 

kC

 

and 

1Cε  for the model LS-RPD are given in Table 2. Their values are chosen such as to fit the 

experimental  data.  Figure  2  shows  the  experimental  and  calculated  profiles  of  the  streamwise 

velocity  and  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  (both  scaled  by  the  inlet  velocity)  at  three  spatial 

locations  in  the  streamwise  direction  x;  y  is  the  vertical  direction.  All  three  models  –  LS,  LS-

RPD, and 

2v<

> − f

– give the same mean velocity profile upstream (

x / H = −

3

) of the backstep 

(Fig. 2(a)). The level of the turbulent kinetic energy at this location is overpredicted by the LS-

RPD model and underpredicted by the LS model. On this and other figures, dashed lines show 

the profiles calculated with the LS model, solid lines show the LS-RPD model profiles, and the 
 
8

dash-double-dotted  lines  correspond  to  the  results  produced  with  the 

2v<

> −

f

  model. 

Experimental data are given by white circles.  

Downstream,  the  LS  model  does  not  correctly  reproduce  the  separation  zone  at  both 

locations  (

x / H =

4

  and  6),  whereas  other  two  models  are  in  a  good  agreement  with  the 

experimental data. In addition, the LS model fails to calculate the correct friction coefficient 

fc  

in the recirculating bubble and underestimates 

fc  in the recovery region, whilst the LS-RPD and 

2v<

> − f

 models produce similar friction levels (Fig. 3) 

 The second test case is the flow in the asymmetric diffuser shown in Fig. 1(b). The flow 

is fully developed at the inlet. The Reynolds number based on the bulk velocity (

) and the inlet 

iu

height (H) is 20,000. The presence of a mild adverse pressure gradient induces a separation on a 

smooth  surface,  which  is  very  challenging  for  turbulence  models.  Mean  velocity  and  turbulent 
18) to identify 

kinetic energy profiles are available as well as wall skin friction (Buice and Eaton

with the measurements (Fig. 4) at three streamwise locations (

). Both LS-RPD 

(with  the  coefficients 

kC

  and 

1Cε   shown  in  Table  2)  and 

<

2v

> −   models  produce  results, 

f

which  are  comparable  in  accuracy  for  the  mean  velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy at all 

three  locations.  These  results  are  in  a  good  agreement  with  the  experimental  data.  Also,  both 

models capture the extent of the separation region very well (Fig. 5). 

The third case is the flow in a periodic wavy channel  (Fig. 1(c)). The Reynolds number 

based on the bulk velocity (

) and the average channel height (H) is 11,000. The flow separates 

iu

on the downhill slope and reattaches on the uphill. Only velocity measurements are available in 
19). Since the level of the turbulent kinetic energy is not known in this case, the 

this case (Kuzan

value  of 

kC

  cannot  be  chosen  and  is  set  to  0.6,  its  homogeneous  value.  The  value  of 

1Cε   is 

chosen  to  fit  the  experimental  data  for  the  mean  velocity  (see  Table  2)).  As  Figure  6 

demonstrates,  three  models  produce  reasonably  accurate  results  at  two  spatial  locations 

x / H

.=

0 25

 and 0.75.  

The  fourth  case  consists  of  the  axisymmetric  combustion  chamber  (Fig.1(d)).  A  central 

pipe stream and an annular swirling stream enter a large cylindrical chamber, and in response to a 

 

9

strong adverse pressure gradient, a recirculating region is created. The Reynolds number based 

on the pipe bulk velocity (

) and diameter (

2R=

) is 75,000. Streamwise (u) and swirl velocities 

iu

(w)  are  measured  at  three  stations  (

x / R

=

0 7 1 68 3 6
.

, .

,

.

)  in  the  chamber  (Hagiwara  et  al.20) 

Again, because experimental data is not available for the turbulent kinetic energy, the coefficient 

kC

 in the LS-RDT model is set (not chosen) to 0.6. The value of 

1Cε  is given in Table 2. The LS 

model  considerably  overestimates  the  extent  of  the  recirculating  bubble  and  reproduces  poorly 

the streamwise and swirl velocities at the location 

x / R

.=

1 68

 (Fig. 7 (b)). At other locations, the 

performance  of  three  models  is  comparable  in  accuracy  and  is  in  good  agreement  with  the 

experimental data. 

The results reported in this paper and Poroseva8 demonstrate that the approximation of the 

coefficients 

kC

 and 

1Cε  by constants works well in all test flows with different geometries and at 

different Reynolds numbers provided that the values of these coefficients are allowed to change 

from flow to flow. However, to use equations (10) and (11) for predictions, that is, in simulation 

of flows for which experimental data are not available, a general functional form should be found 

for 

kC

 and 

1Cε . Currently, only few conclusions about the coefficients 

kC

 and 

1Cε  can be drawn 

based on available experimental and DNS data.  

In  each  test  flow,  the  mean  velocity  and  shear  stress  profiles  (if  available)  appear  to  be 

insensitive to the value of the coefficient 

. That is, they can be well reproduced with 

kC

kC

.=

0 6

 

corresponding to homogeneous turbulence and 

1Cε  chosen to fit the experimental mean velocity 

profile. (The rest of coefficients is set to (12).) Interesting enough, in the round jet and diffuser 

flows, the optimal value found for 

1Cε  (

C

1 1 5
.
ε =

) is the same as recommended for homogeneous 

turbulence in Kassinos et al.15. What determines the final choice of the set (

, kC

1Cε ) in a given 

flow is the turbulent kinetic energy level controlled by the coefficient 

. It appears, however, 

kC

that  in  geometrically-equivalent  flow  situations  at  the  same  Reynolds  number,  multiple 
5 and Moser et al.6) That 

asymptotic states can be observed (see discussion in Rogers and Moser

is, whereas the mean velocity and shear stress profiles are universal (or nearly universal) under 

appropriate  scaling,  the  normal  stresses  and  turbulent  kinetic  energy  profiles  are  non-unique. 

DNS confirms that multiple asymptotic states reflect the differences in the large-scale structure of 

 

10

turbulence,  which  depends  strongly  on  the  Reynolds  number,  “uncontrolled  and  possibly 
unknown  properties  of  the  initial  or  inlet  conditions”  (Moser et  al.6),  flow  geometry,  boundary 

conditions, external forces etc. (Tsinober21). Since this is the coefficient 

kC

, which controls the 

level  of  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy,  the  large-scale  structure  should  be  reflected  through  this 

coefficient.  

The coefficient 

kC

 is linked to the coefficients 

1C

 and 

2C

 through expression 

(8). Thus, 

kC

  should  be  a  function  of  the  same  parameters  as  these  two  coefficients.  Considering  the 

limiting states of turbulence (Poroseva

11), one can show that 

1C

 and 

2C

 are functions at least of 

the  mean  velocity  gradients  and  the  Reynolds  stresses  even  in  homogeneous  turbulence.  No 

universal constant values exist for 

1C

 and 

2C

. Nevertheless, the coefficient 

 does have such a 

kC

value  in  homogeneous  turbulence: 

.=

0 6

.  This  fact  clearly  indicates  that 

kC

1C

  and 

2C

  should 

also depend on parameters which directly relate to inhomogeneous effects such as, e.g., second 

derivatives of flow characteristics and other parameters not specified yet. More study (including 

DNS) is necessary to determine general functional forms for the coefficients 

1C

, 

2C

, and 

kC

.  

As for the coefficient 

1Cε , its value in different flows is close to each other (see Tables 1 

and 2). However, no single value can be recommended for all considered flows. Since variability 

of both coefficients 

kC

 and 

1Cε  is linked to the same mechanism, that is, to the pressure diffusion 

effects, functional forms for both coefficients cannot be considered separately. 

 

 

V. SUMMARY 

In the current paper, the contribution of the “rapid” part of the pressure diffusion to the 

turbulent kinetic energy balance was modeled. In the transport equation, the effect of the “rapid” 

part of the pressure diffusion manifests itself through an additional term related to the production 

term.  This  term  contains  the  model  coefficient 

,  which  is  generally  a  function  of  unknown 

kC

parameters  related  to  the  large-scale  structure  of  turbulence  and  inhomogeneous  effects.  In 

homogeneous turbulence, the coefficient takes the universal value: 

kC

0 6
.=

.  

A new  k ε−  model with the additional term linked to the pressure diffusion effects in the 

transport  equation  for  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  was  derived.  The  standard  ε-equation  does 

 

11

not require any modification. The pressure diffusion effects influence this equation through the 

coefficient 

1Cε , which is a counterpart of the coefficient 

kC

 in the k-equation. The new model 

was validated in four separated flows: a planar diffuser, over a backstep, in a channel with wavy 

walls,  and  in  an  axisymmetric  combustion  chamber.  The  results  obtained  in  these  flows 

complement the results for free shear flows and equilibrium boundary layers reported previously 

in Poroseva

8.  

Since a general functional form is currently unavailable for both coefficients 

kC

 and 

1Cε , 

they  were  approximated  by  constant  values  in  simulations  of  all  test  flows.  The  general 

conclusion  is  that  a  very  good  agreement  between  experimental  and  calculated  profiles  of  the 

mean  velocity,  the  shear  stress,  and  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  as  well  as  the  skin  friction 

coefficient can be achieved if one sets these two coefficients to be constant in any given flow, but 

variable  from  flow  to  flow.  Variability  in  values  of  the  coefficients  can  be  linked,  at  least 

partially,  to  the  large-scale  turbulence  structure.  Available  data,  however,  are  not  sufficient  to 

understand  and  describe  this  connection  between  the  model  coefficients  and  the  large-scale 

structure in a general form.  

The  results  of  simulations  of  the  separated  flows  with  the  new  k ε−   model  are  much 

better than the results produced with the standard  k ε−  model and comparable in accuracy with 

the computational results of more complex four-equation 

<

2v

> −  model.  

f

The  proposed  form  of  the  k-equation  is  not  complete  in  a  sense  that  model  expressions 

used  in  the  equation  to  represent  other  terms  are  not  consistent  with  each  other  and  with  the 

models for both parts of the pressure diffusion term. “Consistency” of models for different terms 

means  that  all  models  are  derived  based  on  the  same  assumptions  and  approximations.  In  this 

sense, however, no two-equation model, which can be called “complete”, is currently available. 

This issue should be addressed in future studies.

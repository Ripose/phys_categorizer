The term beta-beam has been coined for the production of a pure beam of electron 
neutrinos or their antiparticles through the decay of radioactive ions circulating in a 
storage ring. This concept requires radioactive ions to be accelerated to as high Lorentz γ 
as 150. The neutrino source itself consists of a storage ring for this energy range, with 
long straight sections in line with the experiment(s). Such a decay ring does not exist at 
CERN today, nor does a high-intensity proton source for the production of the radioactive 
ions. Nevertheless, the existing CERN accelerator infrastructure could be used as this 
would still represent an important saving for a beta-beam facility.

1. Introduction 
 
The proposed beta-beam facility [1] can be divided in two parts, the low energy part 
stretching up to 100 MeV/u and the high energy part for the acceleration to higher 
energies and for the stacking process in the decay ring (see figure 1). The division is 
logical as the low energy part corresponds to the requirements for a radioactive beam 
factory of ISOL type as proposed and promoted by the Nuclear Physics community. The 
high energy part, which serves the neutrino physics community, would only be one of 
several clients of such a radioactive beam facility and would consequently share the cost 
and use of the low energy part with other physics communities. 
 
The radioactive ions (6He and 18Ne) will be produced in an ISOL system using the 
proposed Superconducting Proton Linac (SPL) as a driver. They will be ionised, bunched  
and accelerated with a linac to approximately 100 MeV/u. From the linac they will be 
injected into a storage ring and ejected to a fast cycling synchrotron for acceleration to 
300 MeV/u. The ions will be extracted into the existing Proton Synchrotron (PS) and 
accelerated to PS top energy in several bunches. Following this they will be transferred to 
the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and accelerated to top energy. Finally, they will be 
transferred to the new decay ring where they will be merged with the already circulating 
bunch through a longitudinal stacking procedure. While this might appear 
straightforward, several bottlenecks exist in this process, not least the bunching at low 
energy, space charge limitations in the PS and the SPS, decay losses in the acceleration 
chain and the longitudinal stacking procedure at high energy in the decay ring. In this 
paper we will discuss the problems encountered and some possible solutions that have 
been proposed. 

2. Ion production 
The flux of neutrinos in the decay ring will be determined by the half life at a given 
Lorentz γ of the radioactive ions and the equilibrium intensity stored. The flux at the 
detector will further depend on the average energy of the neutrinos at rest as this will 
determine the focusing of the neutrino beam. A further constraint is set by the decay 
losses in the accelerator chain that will increase with shorter half lives and possible decay 
products that could create long lived contamination in the low energy part. All these 
constrains together points towards two isotopes of particular interest, 6He giving a beam 
of anti-ν and 18Ne for ν [2].  Both can be produced in large quantities through the so 
called ISOL method. The helium isotope is best produced in a beryllium target using a 
very intense primary proton beam impinging on a so called neutron converter (fission) 
and the Neon isotope through spallation of a MgO target with a less intense 2 GeV proton 
beam hitting the target material directly. It is possible to produce a factor of ten more 
helium isotopes than neon isotopes thanks to the converter technology. 

3. Ionization, bunching and pre-acceleration 
The isotope can be transported from the ISOL target in gas form given the fact that the 
chosen elements are noble gases. Alternatively a high efficiency (for noble gases) mono 
charge ECR source [3,4] can be used close to the target and the singly charged ions can 

CERN AB 2003 (DRAFT) 

be transported using classical beam transport. In either case the beam has subsequently to 
be bunched for the further acceleration and injection into synchrotrons. Efficient 
bunching (<20 microseconds) and full stripping of a high intensity beam can be achieved 
using a high frequency (60 GHz) ECR source [5]. While such a system does not exist 
today theoretical calculations show that it can be constructed. Furthermore, the necessary 
components will soon be available and the required RF generator is available off the shelf 
and could be assembled for a first feasibility test in the close future. 
 
Acceleration of high intensity radioactive beams to 100 MeV/u has already been studied 
within the EU financed RTD study EURISOL [6] using a linac. This study is planned to 
be pursued in a design study within the EU 6th framework programme.  

4. Acceleration 
The existing CERN accelerator infrastructure can handle high intensity ion beams but 
space charge constrains at injection into the first major CERN synchrotron, the PS, would 
require an injection energy of at least 300 MeV/u for the intensities required for the beta-
beam. Furthermore, the linac beam will indeed be bunched (from the ECR source) but 
will need further shortening to fit the necessary intensity into the PS. A first stage of 
additional bunching and fast acceleration is pictured to take place in a combined storage 
ring and rapid cycling synchrotron. The most promising scenario is injection by classical 
multi-turn injection of the linac beam into the storage ring followed by fast acceleration 
and transfer to the PS. The ion bunches will wait in the PS until all buckets (8-16 
bunches) are filled for acceleration to higher energies. The top energy of the PS will 
depend on the mass charge ratio of the ions and will be slightly different for Neon and 
Helium. The transfer to the next CERN synchrotron, the SPS, will encounter space 
charge limitations [2], which will require that the transverse emittance is increased 
possibly by multiple passages through a foil. The SPS has to be fitted with a new 40 MHz 
RF system to handle these long bunches but transfer to the existing 200 MHz system can 
take place at the transition energy, something that will reduce the costs for the necessary 
modifications [2].  

5. Stacking 
The energy of the ν and anti-ν beam from the beta-beam facility will be in the range of 
the atmospheric neutrinos so the ions have to be kept in short bunches  in the decay ring 
to permit a efficient back-ground suppression in the detector. A target value of in total 
four bunches not longer than 10 ns each have been chosen for the conceptual design. The 
intensity of the individual bunches can be increased through stacking of neon and helium 
ions. Stacking has been used for many particle types in different applications and consists 
of a regular re-fill of the bunch before the already present particles ceased being useful. 
Many recent stacking methods use some form of beam cooling to reduce the phase space 
density and make room for more particles within a given transverse and longitudinal 
emittance. Cooling times for heavy light ions at high energies using classical methods 
such as electron cooling and stochastic cooling are long and can not easily be reduced. A 
new scheme of longitudinal stacking has been proposed for the beta beam [2] using a 
combination of bunch rotation and asymmetric bunch merging. The freshly injected ion 
bunches (as many as permanently circulating bunches) are initially placed on a dispersion 

CERN AB 2003 (DRAFT) 

orbit to avoid that the injection elements, septa and kicker magnets, influence the 
circulating beam. In a second stage the fresh beam is rotated in longitudinal phase space 
which means that they lose or gain energy in such a way that they are physically moved 
to the orbit of the residing bunches. This is achieved by capturing the residing bunches 
and the injected bunches in a common large RF bucket in which the bunches can rotate 
ending up on the same orbit. In the next stage the RF bucket is manipulated by an 
additional RF system so that the injected bunch is moved and mixed with an equal 
proportion of the centre of the residing bunch. This is a common beam manipulation in 
synchrotrons named bunch merging or splitting, but in this case it is modified so that it 
only affects the actual populated part of phase space avoiding merging a large proportion 
of empty space from the smaller injected bunch with the residing bunch. The fact that 
only the central part of the residing bunch is affected will result in a net increase in the 
core intensity pushing the surrounding “older” ions out towards the bucket separatrix 
where eventually the “oldest” ions will be lost. The latter part of this operation - the 
asymmetric bunch merging - has recently been tested in the CERN PS with success [7]. 
Empty phase phase space from an imaginary adjacent smaller bucket was merged with a 
high intensity proton beam (see figure 2). The PS RF system could be modified to permit 
full longitudinal beam control of the process yielding a high degree of efficiency. 

6. Intensity

completed stacking cycle is, assuming no beam losses,

The experience at CERN is that the losses through the accelerator chain will be less than 
50% excluding decay losses. Taking the given production rates after the ECR source, 
allowing for decay in the accelerator chain we arrive at the values given in table 1 for the 
intensities stored for our conceptual design. Note that the γ for the Neon ions is only 70 
compared to 150 for the helium ions. Early simulations showed that this was a reasonable 
approach.

Table 1: Intensities and average loss power for the 6He (top) and  18Ne (bottom) beam, 
assuming a 16 Hz fast cycling synchrotron and 8 s SPS cycle time. Only beta-decay 
losses are taken into account. To get an approximate number for Ntot with losses taken 
into account, the number of ions in the decay ring should be multiplied with a factor 0.5. 

 

7. Decay losses 
The main difference between the acceleration to high energies of stable ions and 
radioactive ions are the losses induced by the radioactive decay during the acceleration 
process. The isotopes proposed for the beta-beam conceptual design have been chosen so 
that no long-lived activity is left to contaminate the low energy part. At high energies the 
ions are likely to break up and it has been shown that the induced activity is well 
approximated by the simultaneous loss of the same number of protons as the total A of 
the studied ion type [8]. A first simulation of losses in the decay ring for the conceptual 
design [9] yields that the dose rate of the arcs is limited to 2.5 mSv/h after 30 days of 
operation and 1 day of cooling. Furthermore, the induced radioactivity in the ground 
water will have no major impact on public safety. It has also been confirmed that the total 
loss in the accelerator chain will be beyond the nominal 1 W/m for hands on maintenance 
except in the PS [10], something that will require further thought, see table 1.  

8. Possible improvements 
A number of more speculative improvements to the conceptual design have recently been 
proposed [11], they will all require much more work to reach the same maturity as the 
parameters in the conceptual design. However, it is worth presenting them here to permit 
a larger community to participate in the evaluation process of their feasibility. 
 
The decay losses in the PS can be dramatically reduced by the construction of a new fast 
cycling synchrotron. The synchrotron should also have a higher maximum magnetic 
rigidity permitting a reduction of space charge constrains at PS-SPS transfer. An increase 
of the Neon production is highly wished for and a possible design with multiple targets in 
sequence making use of the same proton beam has been proposed. It is imagined that the 
Neon production could be increased with as much as factor of three using this concept 
[12]. A very important improvement of the ν and anti-ν flux could be achieved by storing 
Neon and Helium ions simultaneously in the decay ring [13]. This is possible even if the 
mass to charge ratio is different for these two types of ions if the required difference in 
mean bending radius is small or if an artificial total orbit length is added through an 
insertion for one particle type. In the latter case it is probably necessary to consider the 

CERN AB 2003 (DRAFT) 

use of two independent RF systems for the two particle types. That would also simplify 
the stacking procedure as the two ion types would be longitudinally independent. The 
difference in mean bending radius ρ is, assuming a fixed magnetic rigidity, Bρdipole, set 
by the magnetic field B and the bending radius of the dipoles ρdipole in the ring:

The acceleration of two ion types for simultaneous use in the decay ring will require 
separate acceleration cycles, something that necessarily will lengthen the interval 
between stacking in the decay ring which will reduce the maximum number of ions 
stored and require special RF manipulations (e.g independent RF systems) to avoid 
disturbing the “wrong” ions during stacking. An increased longitudinal acceptance can 
compensate for most of the losses. Evidently, the maximum stored intensity can also be 
increased by a shorter total accelerator cycle. The actual magnetic cycle time for the SPS, 
which determines the length of the overall cycle can probably be decreased if the beta-
beam was the only user of the SPS. However, the beta-beam facility is imagined to be 
taken into operation while LHC operation, CNGS operation and possibly new fixed target 
physics still are part of the CERN physics programme. Still, an optimization of the 
machine use can probably yield a shorter average cycling time, in particular if the 
required maximum γ for ions can be reduced. 
 
Taking all this improvements into account a new simulation of the physics reach for this 
more speculative scenario has been performed [14]. While the earlier simulations [15] 
based on the conceptual design are already showing an impressive physics reach and 
clearly motivates a continued study of a beta-beam facility, the new simulation results 
show that the here discussed upgrade options are well worth pursuing. The target values 
from the latest simulation [14] for γ and intensity in the decay ring with both ion types 
present are for helium at γ=60 a total of 4x1013 ions in the ring and for neon at γ=100 a 
total of 2x1013 in the ring. 
 
It also been proposed that experiments relevant for astrophysics and nuclear structure 
could be performed with a low energy beta-beam [16]. The advantage compared to static 
neutrino sources, such as nuclear power plants and spallation sources are the possibility 
to choose either a ν beam or an anti-ν beam and the fact that the neutrinos are delivered 
as a beam with a preferred direction. There are two possibilities, either experiments in a 
close detector at the here proposed beta-beam facility or a dedicated low energy ring with 
possibly other more long lived isotopes and an almost continues injection to produce a 
very intense ν or anti-ν beam. 

9. Conclusions 
The conceptual design for the beta-beam is based on realistic estimates and conservative 
extrapolations. The only point that raises some concern is the losses in the PS which 

CERN AB 2003 (DRAFT) 

would make it difficult to continue hands on maintenance for at least parts of the 
machine. It is probably necessary to at least envisage an upgrade of the cycling time to 
reduce these losses and increase the overall efficiency of the accelerator chain.  
 
The more speculative scenario with increased Neon production and simultaneous storage 
of both ion types requires much more work before it can be set on the same firm ground 
as the conceptual design. Still, it is clearly well worth pursuing.  
 
The low energy beta-beam opens new fields of physics for a beta-beam facility. A 
detailed analysis of the requirements on the flux is in progress together with first 
estimations for the design parameters of the associated low energy decay ring.

Photosystem 0 (PS0) is a proposed membrane-based mechanism for free energy gain as ATP 
from fluctuating light. The PS0 reaction centers have no reducing power: charge transport is 
only temporary. Light induces within the reaction centers metastable dipoles that generate a 
membrane potential that drives ATP synthesis while protons move through the ATPsynthase 
enzyme. After the decay of the dipole potential in the dark, the protons either (1) return across 
the membrane by conduction or (2) are pumped back by ATPsynthase, backwards active as 
ATPase at a higher H+/ATP ratio. PS0 constitutes a link to previously proposed free energy 
sources for early evolution that work on thermal cycling. Several contemporary 
photosynthetic phenomena may be relics of PS0.

from the MTS (membrane-associated  
thermosynthesis) machinery by stepwise 
addition of temporary charge carriers (Fig. 3) 
until it spans the membrane, or even beyond: 
the stalk present in many bacterial RCs (BRCs) 
has in PS0 the function of increasing the RC 
dipole moment.  
 
The present study elaborates on PS0 and

states, inactive RCs, effects of intermittent

Introduction 

A scenario has been proposed for the 
emergence of bacterial photosynthesis (BPS) 
in which progenitors of the photosynthetic 
machinery work as heat engines during 
thermal cycling (Muller 1993, 1995, 1996, 
1998). Fig. 1 shows the proposed stepwise 
evolutionary path that starts with the F1 moiety 
of ATPsynthase (or, more precisely, its β 
subunit) and ends with a membrane-diffusible 
lipid-bound quinone (acquisition of the bc1 
complex and light harvesting complex (LHC) 
is not shown). The heat engines are linked to 
BPS by Photosystem 0 (PS0), a mechanism 
that, in the absence of charge transfer across 
the membrane, works on light-dark cycling 
(Fig. 2). The PS0 reaction centers (RCs) form 
metastable dipoles in the light that decay in the 
dark, and generate a dipole potential that 
results in a membrane potential that in turn 
drives ATP synthesis in the standard

Photosynthesis.  
The components of the machinery of bacterial 
photosynthesis are acquired in the sequence: 
1. the F1 part of ATPsynthase, during the 
emergence of protein-associated thermosynthesis 
(PTS); 
2. the Fo part of ATPsynthase and the lipids of an 
asymmetric membrane, during the emergence of 
membrane-associated thermosynthesis (MTS); 
3. the reaction center acquired the stepping stones 
for the excited electron one after the other during 
the emergence of photosystem 0 (PS0); 
4. membrane-diffusible lipid-bound quinones, 
during the emergence of bacterial photosynthesis 
(BPS). 
 
 

 

 

 
Fig. 2. Basic principle of the PS0 mechanism. A 
membrane contains reaction centers and an 
ATPsynthase that can charge and discharge the 
membrane at different H+/ATP stoichiometries or 
modes, here 3 and 5 H+/ATP. Upon illumination (a 
> b) electric dipoles are formed in the PS0 reaction 
centers. The dipoles result in a dipole potential of 
the membrane (c), which in turn increases the 
potential across the membrane. The ATPsynthase 
discharges the membrane in 10 turnovers, 
transporting 30 protons, yielding, in mode 3, 10 
ATP molecules (d). After the light-dark switch the 
electric dipoles decay again (d > e), causing the 
dipole potential to vanish and the membrane 
potential to drop (e). The ATPsynthase charges the 
membrane at a high H+/ATP mode of 5. In 6 
turnovers, 30 protons are transported, at a cost of 6 
ATP molecules (f). At the end of the light-dark 
cycle (a), a net profit has been made of 10 - 6 = 4 
ATP molecules.

carrying stepping stones. The elongated ellipse

The Photosystem 0 mechanism 

Fluctuating light PS0 works on light-dark 
cycling, or fluctuating light, which occurs in 
natural waters due to variable focusing and 
defocusing of sunlight by surface waves 
(Schenck 1957; Snyder and Dera 1970). A 
quickly moving light-dark pattern results that 
can be seen on the sea bed and at the bottom of 
swimming pools. The cycle times of these 
fluctuations range between 0,1 and 10 s. 
 

Fig. 4. The dipole potential: across a layer of 
dipoles a potential difference is present. 
 
The dipole potential In standard photosynthesis 
the membrane acts as a capacitor during the 
generation of the membrane potential ∆Ψ. 
After a saturating flash, ∆Ψ equals ∆Q / Cm, 
with ∆Q the charge transported across the 
membrane per unit area, and Cm the electric 
capacity per unit area (typically ~1 µF/cm2). 
This ∆Ψ is called 'Charge-Separation Potential' 
(CSP), symbol ∆ΨCS. ∆Q equals the product 
of N, the surface density of the RCs, ne, the 
number of electrons transported per RC per 
flash, and e, the elementary charge; Cm equals 
ε/ d, where ε = εr εo is the dielectric constant 
of the membrane and d its thickness. Thus, 
∆ΨCS =  N ne e d / εo εr 
N is the inverse of A, the membrane area per 
RC. Hence,  
 
∆ΨCS  = ne e d / A εo εr   
 
 
The potential generated across a layer of 
dipoles is called ‘dipole potential’, or ‘dipole 
layer potential’ (Fig. 4). The photosynthetic 
dipole potential (PDP), ∆ΨPDP, is formed 
when the electrons excited by a flash halt after 
a displacement x within the RCs, i.e. inside the 
membrane. The Helmholtz formula (Jones 
1975, p. 38; Schuhmann 1990) then applies, 
the potential across a layer of dipoles with 

(Junge 1977; Witt 1979)

=  ne e x / A εo εr                      (1) 

dipole moment µ, placed at a surface density 
N in a medium with dielectric constant ε, 
equals N µ / ε . µ equals ne e x. Substitution 
gives, 
 
∆ΨPDP  =  N ne e x / εo εr  
 
 
Note that ∆ΨPDP / ∆ΨCS = x / d (Jursinic et al. 
1978; Höök and Brzezinski 1994; Popovic et 
al. 1986). For x = d, ∆ΨPDP = ∆ΨCS. Although 
the values can be identical, the potentials are 
essentially different: upon illumination with 
multiple saturating flashes the CSP will 
continue to increase while the PDP remains 
constant after the first flash.  

The surface area per RC, A, follows directly 
from the number of RC particles per square 
micron visible in the electron microscope 
(Staehelin 1986). The lower limit of A equals 
the surface area of the RC, ARC. Removing 
LHCs decreases ARC. A may be 25 nm2 for 
crystallized central RC cores, 120 nm2 for 
thylakoids with crystallized RCs (Staehelin 
1986), and 150 nm2 for BRCs in 
chromatophores (Golecki and Oelze 1980). 
Since the RC particle visible under the 
electron microscope is a dimer (Boekema et 
al. 1994; Santini et al. 1994) old reported 
values of RCII densities in chloroplasts and 
cyanobacteria (Staehelin 1986) can be 
doubled, this yields for chloroplasts a value of 
450 nm2 for A.  
 
Estimated PDP values Eqn (1) can be 
written as1,  
 
∆ΨPDP [mV]  

 

= 18070 ne x[nm] / εr A[nm2] 

 
The range of possible ∆ΨPDP values is wide, 
from < 5 to 6000 mV: substituting the feasible 
values of ne 4, x 4, εr 2 and A 25, yields 5800 

                                                           
1 18070 
 = 103 * 1,6 10-19 * 10-9 / 8,854 10-12 / 10-18 

mV, whereas substituting ne 1, x 1, εr 4,5 and 
A 500 yields 8 mV. The PDP increases with 
high ne and x, and low εr and A values. 

 

Comparable CSP values of up to a few 
hundreds of mV have previously been 
calculated and observed. For chromatophores 
Jackson and Crofts (1969) reported a CSP of 
430 mV directly after a dark-light switch. 
Packham et al. (1978) assumed values of ne 1, 
x 3, εr 3,8 and A 311, which gives 46 mV, the 
observed value in their single saturating flash 
experiments. For a single RC turnover, 
Wraight et al. (1978) calculated a CSP of 100-
140 mV. For chloroplasts Witt assumed ne 2, x 
3, εr 2, A 1000, resulting in a CSP of 55 mV. 
Zimányi and Garab (1982) assumed for 
chloroplasts ne 1, x 7, εr 2 and A 970, which 
yields 65 mV.  
 

The smaller PDP precedes the CSP, and may 
approach single-flash CSP values. PDP values 
higher than 50 mV are feasible for 
chloroplasts. Where crystallized RCs are 
present in the membrane, or for 
chromatophores, even higher values of ~ 200 
mV seem feasible. 
 
ATPsynthase /ATPase The protons driven 
through ATPsynthase by the PDP must 
eventually return. This can simply be effected 
by letting the protons return by conduction. A 
more interesting but more complex way is to 
pump the protons back by the same  
ATPsynthase, now active as an ATPase. A 
symmetry break is involved: for a net gain of  
ATP the backward reaction has to occur at a 
higher H+/ATP ratio or ‘mode’. In Fig. 2, for 
example, the two modes are 3 and 5. Fig. 5 
shows the proposed regulation of  
ATPsynthase: at high ∆Ψ active in a low 
mode, at low ∆Ψ active in a high mode, and at 
intermediate ∆Ψ inactive. This type of 
regulation was previously proposed for  
membrane-associated thermosynthesis 
 (Muller 1993). Van Walraven et al. (1997) 
have reported a similar dependence of the 
H+/ATP ratio on the light intensity and

Fig. 5. The Photosystem 0 cycle, the membrane voltage - 
photosynthetic dipole potential (∆Ψ - ∆ΨPDP) cycle of 
the proposed mechanism. Changes in ∆ΨPDP are due to 
a changing light intensity. The graph of the cycle 
consists of isocharges and isopotentials. Isocharges (a, b 
and c) result from the linear relation between ∆Ψ and 
∆ΨPDP in the absence of charge transfer across the 
membrane such as ATPsynthase activity. The isocharges 
Vn and Vm depict the equilibrium potentials for mode n 
(n H+/ATP) and mode m (m H+ /ATP) activities; Vn and 
Vm also constitute activity treshold potentials, enzyme 
activity is switched-on or -off at these potentials. 
ATPsynthase is active either for ∆Ψ ≥ Vn in mode n, or 
for ∆Ψ ≤ Vm in mode m; this restricts ∆Ψ to Vm ≤ ∆Ψ ≤ 
Vn. 
The cycle starts in 1, with ∆Ψ = Vm, where a light 
intensity increase inactivates mode m because ∆Ψ has 
increased by the ∆ΨPDP increase. Isocharge b is 
followed until Vn is reached (2) and mode n is activated. 
∆ΨPDP continues to rise (total change: ∆∆ΨPDP), but 
charge transfer by ATPsynthase keeps ∆Ψ at Vn  
(2 > 3). The free energy obtained as ATP by the charge 
transfer equals dQ Vn, in which dQ =  
Cm (∆Ψb(3) -Vn) = Cm {∆∆ΨPDP -(Vn -Vm)}  
is the charge transferred. A subsequent decrease in light 
intensity in 3 decreases ∆Ψ, which inactivates mode n. 
Isocharge c is followed until ∆Ψ drops below Vm, and 
mode m is activated (4). Along isopotential Vm the 
membrane is recharged (4 > 1), at a cost of dQ Vm, until 
point 1 is reached again. The net free chemical energy 
gained as ATP is  dQ (Vn - Vm)=  
Cm { ∆∆ΨPDP - (Vn - Vm) } (Vn - Vm).  

As example, consider ∆∆ΨPDP of 200 mV, with n and 
m values of 3 and 5 (V3 = 157 mV, V5 = 94 mV, see 
text): this yields 9 nJ/cm2 for the work done on the 
ATP/ADP system in one PS0 cycle. 
 
 
temperature when these conditions remain 
constant. In practice the regulation of 
ATPsynthase is indeed complex, depending 
strongly on ∆µH+. At low ∆µH+, ADP binding 
can inactivate chloroplast ATPsynthase, but at 
a high ∆µH+ the enzyme can be reactivated 
with simultaneous release of the bound ADP 
(Junesch and Gräber 1987). Provided the 
mode changes appropriately, the ∆GP and 
redox state may regulate this enzyme similar 
to as proposed here (Muller 1993). 

 

The Photosystem 0 Cycle with a variable 
ATPsynthase stoichiometry 
Figure 5 gives the trajectory of the membrane 
voltage ∆Ψ on a ∆Ψ-∆ΨPDP plot during a PS0 
cycle. The cycle is similar to the MTS cycle 
(Muller 1993), the PDP replacing the 
temperature as variable. Both the ∆ΨPDP, and 
the membrane voltage ∆Ψ rise with the light 
intensity until ATPsynthase is activated in a 
low mode. Further increase in ∆ΨPDP results 
in a discharge of the membrane through the 
ATPsynthase, which stabilizes ∆Ψ at the low 
mode activation potential. Lowering the light 
intensity causes ∆ΨPDP, and as a consequence, 
∆Ψ, to decrease, inactivating the low mode. 
Upon a further ∆Ψ decrease the enzyme is 
reactivated in the backwards direction in the 
high mode, which stabilizes the low ∆Ψ until 
the end of the cycle. 
 
The cycle time may be as small as seconds, 
since electron transport within the RC occurs 
in milliseconds, and in vivo the ATPsynthase 
of chloroplasts can be activated and 
deactivated within milliseconds and seconds, 
respectively (Harris and Crofts 1978; Inoue et 
al. 1978). At this cycle time, the power of PS0 
will be larger than the power of membrane-
associated thermosynthesis, where the cycling 
time is the one due to convection, and 
estimated to be larger than 10 s (Muller 1993). 

On the other hand the power of PS0 shall be 
smaller than the power of BPS, as the 
comparable cycle time in the latter is the 
diffusion time of the quinone across the 
membrane, which is in the millisecond range. 
 
Evolution of PS0 from MTS 
MTS works on thermal cycling, caused by 
convection in a natural water such as a 
volcanic hot spring. The temperature changes 
result in thermotropic phase transitions of the 
membrane, which in turn change the dipole 
potentials of the two lipid monolayers that 
constitute it. Such lipid dipole potential 
changes of monolayers have been well 
documented for lipid monolayers at the 
water/air interface (MacDonald and Simon 
1987). In MTS, using  an symmetric 
biomembrane, the resulting membrane 
potential drives ATP synthesis in the standard 
chemiosmotic manner, using the same 
ATPsynthase with a variable H+/ATP ratio as 
proposed here for PS0 (Muller 1993).  
 
MTS is assumed to have yielded the 
scaffolding for the emergence of PS0 (Fig 1) 
as follows. 
The first PS0 system consisted of a membrane 
protein that contained a single pigment, for 
instance a chlorophyll molecule. During the 
MTS convection cycle the pigment would be 
subject to cyclic illumination because of the 
higher light intensity near the surface of the 
convection cell. In daylight a single 
chlorophyll molecule will absorb a photon 
about every second (Clayton 1980). The 
excited state resulting from light absorption 
was stabilized by the formation of a triplet 
state, which has a lifetime in the range of 
seconds (Hoff 1986). Excited states having a 
higher polarizability, the pigment would 
contribute to the net polarization of the 
membrane, a contribution varying in 
synchrony with the convection cycle. A 
macroscopic energy-conversion device 
similarly working on polarization changes of a 
dielectric due to light-induced excited states 
has previously been proposed (Glazebrook and 
Thomas, 1982).  
In this combined MTS/PS0 system the 
contribution of the excited state of a pigment 

 

5

to the overall dipole potential can at first only 
have been small. By addition of charge 
carriers to the mentioned protein, and allowing 
for transfer of the excited electron to these 
carriers, larger light-induced dipoles were 
obtained (Fig. 3). In this way the contribution 
of light-induced polarization changes steadily 
increased with respect to the temperature-
induced polarization changes. In the end, 
temperature cycling would not be required for 
energy conversion any more, although some 
dependency may have remained in other 
physiological processes. 
 

Phenomena during contemporary 
photosynthesis possibly related to PS0 
Metastable dipole states in RCs These states 
are related to delayed fluorescence, 
luminescence, and phosphorescence. 
Metastable states with decay times between 1 
ms and 10 s have cycle times similar to that of 
in situ fluctuating light. 
 
Contrast by the’ two-electron gate’ PS0 
benefits from 'contrast' , a PDP vs. light 
intensity resembling a step-function. Contrast 
could be obtained by stabilization in the light 
and destabilization in the dark of the light-
induced dipole, such as effected by the 'two-
electron gate' (Vermeglio 1977; Wraight 1977, 
1982).  
 
Inactive RCII In green algae and chloroplasts a 
significant RCII fraction is ‘inactive’, the 
quinone QA cannot reduce the quinone QB 
(Chylla et al. 1987; Chylla and Whitmarsh 
1989, 1990; Lavergne and Leci 1993). 
Inactive centers contribute to the membrane 
potential. Their decay half-time is on the PS0 
time scale range, t½ ∼1,7 s.  
 
Etiolation of Chloroplasts Submitting growing 
chloroplasts to intermittent light (2-118 min 
LD) stops their development in the so-called 
etiolated phase, in which the antenna is 
smaller (Glick and Melis 1988) and the RC 
density higher (Akoyunoglou 1977). Such 
etiolated, or intermittent light thylakoids are 
however completely active.  
 

Chloroplast Oscillations Chloroplasts oscillate 
on the same time scale range as PS0. 
”Everything oscillates” (Walker 1992): 
fluorescence, ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, 
∆pH, stacking and swelling, oxygen evolution 
and CO2 assimilation. PS0-like processes may 
be involved in the oscillations, or their 
biogenesis. 
 
State 1-State 2 Transitions Both temperature 
(Weis 1985) and light intensity changes 
(Rouag and Dominy 1994) have been 
proposed as causes for state transitions.  
 
Stacking and Swelling of Chloroplasts 
Stacking may effectively remove LHCs from 
the membrane, increasing the RC density, 
since the stacked area may not function as 
capacitor, a dielectric that separates lumen and 
stroma (Williams 1978; Barber 1979). Inactive 
RCII is found mainly in the stroma exposed 
region (Guenther and Melis 1990), active RCII 
in the grana (Staehelin and Arntzen 1979). 
Upon heat treatment RCII cores move to the 
stroma (Staehelin 1986; Anderson and 
Andersson 1988), effectively increasing the 
RC density in the stroma exposed membrane. 
Stacking therefore can decrease the capacitor 
area and increase the RC density, which would 
benefit PS0 activity by a PDP increase. The 
small and short charge separation in PS0 may 
lessen the chance of damage by highly 
oxidized or reduced species. 
 

Discussion 

Many photosynthetic phenomena are 
reminiscent of PS0 and may be relics of a 
light-cycling requirement in early metabolism. 
Another possible metabolic relic is the light-
dark switch requiring synthesis of a 17,5 kDa 
translation intermediate of the D1 protein of 
RCII, which is not formed during continuous 
darkness or illumination (Inagaki and Satoh 
1992). Similarly, a light-dark switch is 
required by protochlorophyllide synthesis in 
etiolated leaves (Sironval et al. 1969).  
Many photoperiodic phenomena are known, 
with the molecular mechanisms often still 
unresolved—PS0 may help in disentangling 
their ontogeny and phylogeny. Bacterial 

 

6

genomes may contain vestiges of genes that 
coded for proteins that supported functional 
reconstructions such as PS0.  
PS0 is of interest as a possibly verifiable 
solution to the unsolved problems (Scherer 
1983) of the biogenesis of cyclic 
photosynthetic electron transport, the nature of 
the first photosynthetic reaction centers 
(Blankenship 1992) and why things happen in 
reaction centers as they do (Gunner 1991).  
 

Conclusion 
Photosystem 0 allows a stepwise model for the 
emergence and early evolution of 
photosynthesis, is a possible ancestor of the 
chloroplast, and gives a new viewpoint on 
many observations and experimental findings 
in photosynthesis.

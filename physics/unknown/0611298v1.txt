Abstract 

 
Velocity-modulation  Fourier  transform  emission  spectra  from  a  N2O/He  discharge  plasma 
recorded between 1 and 5.5 µm are described. Surprisingly, they show Doppler-shifted lines for 
the E  2Σ+- D  2Σ+, C  2Π- A  2Σ+, and D  2Σ+- A  2Σ+ Rydberg-Rydberg rovibronic transitions of the 
nitric  oxide  neutral  molecule.  These  polarity-dependent  Doppler-shifts  are  those  of  positively 
charged particles. Vibration-rotation lines of NO and transitions from other neutral molecules like 
N2 are also present in the spectra with comparable intensities and remain unshifted. Experimental 
investigations and possible explanations are discussed.

1.  Introduction 
Selective detection spectroscopic techniques are attractive because they discriminate transient 
molecules  against  the  more  abundant  precursor  molecules.  As  a  consequence  they  have  been 
popular  for  a  long  time  in  laser  absorption  spectroscopy.  Amongst  them  velocity  modulation 
(VM)  [1]  has  been  since  1983  successfully  implemented  for  the  search  and  characterization  of 
molecular  ions.    Selective  approach  has  not  been  widely  adopted  for  high-resolution  work  in 
Fourier  Transform  Spectroscopy  (FTS).  Double  modulation  FTS  (DMFTS)  [2,3]  developed  at 
Laboratoire  de  PhotoPhysique  Moléculaire  (Orsay,  France)  a  few  years  ago,  enable  the 
simultaneous  acquisition  of  selective  and  non-selective  high-resolution  emission  or  absorption 
interferograms.  The  resulting  combined  advantages  of  broad  spectral  coverage  and  accurate 
wavenumber  determination  have  for  instance  proven  to  be  useful  [4]  for  Doppler  shifts 
measurements  leading  to  an  investigation  on  the  vibrational  and  rotational  dependence  of  the 
average mobility of ArH+ in the positive column of an Ar/He glow discharge.   

In this letter, emission spectra from an N2O/He discharge plasma recorded between 1800 and 
10 000 cm-1 with DMFTS using VM selection are presented.  Surprisingly, the selective spectra 
show  strong  first-derivative-type  lines  of  Rydberg-Rydberg  rovibronic  transitions  of  the  nitric 
oxide neutral molecule. This results from Doppler shifts that would be encountered by positively 
charged  particles.  Polarity-dependent  lineshifts  from  neutrals  in  glow  discharges  have  already 
been seldomly reported.  They are restricted to Doppler shifts in the light molecules H2 [5,6] or 
He  [7,8]  induced  by  momentum  transferred  from  colliding  electrons.  Consequently  the  neutral 
behave  like  anions.  To  our  knowledge,  this  experiment  presents,  with  NO,  the  first  high 
resolution  spectroscopic  detection  of  a  cation-like drift-velocity of a neutral molecule. Detailed 
description of the experimental investigations is given and tentative explanations are discussed.  

2.  Experiment 
Experimental observations described in this paper were initiated by unexpected results while 
running  preliminary  tests  for  another  experiment.  The  VMFT    spectra  of  a  N2O/He  discharge 
exhibited strong first-derivative-type profiles belonging to the E 2Σ+- D 2Σ+, C 2Π- A 2Σ+, and D 
2Σ+- A 2Σ+ Rydberg-Rydberg rovibronic transitions of NO. Various experimental conditions were 
then explored to investigate the phenomenon. They are presented hereafter . 

The emission source is a discharge tube, identical to the one described in [9]. It has an inner 
diameter equal to 0.7 cm and the discharge zone length is 25 cm long. The gas N2O/He (or N2O 
or NO/He) flows through the tube at a constant rate from a central inlet to two exit ports located 
at both ends.  Gas pressures are not measured inside the discharge. As a consequence, their ratio 
is more accurate than their absolute values. The discharge is applied between two water-cooled 
stainless steel electrodes, one electrode being kept to the ground. Both ac- and dc- excitations of 
the plasma are used. The ac high voltage power-supply consists by two audio amplifiers, stepped 
up by two 50-kHz 3-dB bandwidth transformers. The emitting plasma  is optically conjugated to 
the high-resolution stepping-mode interferometer of Laboratoire de Photophysique Moléculaire.  
When  the  plasma  is  produced  in  an  ac  discharge,  a  selective  VMFT  spectrum  is  recorded 
simultaneously  with    the  usual  non-selective  emission  spectrum.  A  detailed  description  of  the 
acquisition  procedure  is  given  in  [2].  Briefly,  path  difference  modulation  is  practiced  as  usual 
with  stepping  mode  FTS  and  related  synchronous  detection  leads  to  the  classical  non-selective 
interferogram. Additionally, velocity modulation provides the selective detection of ionic species. 
An  alternative  electric  field  inside  a  discharge  changes  the  net  drift-velocity  of  the  ions  at  the 
discharge  excitation  current  frequency.  This  results  in    synchronous  Doppler  shifts  of  the

frequency  of  their  transitions.  An  appropriate  lock-in  detection    keeps  only  the  field-sensitive 
transitions.

The experimental conditions of the spectra are summarized in Table 1. In the 5500-10000 
cm-1 region, when using N2O/He as precursors, the DM spectrum (nb.3534 in Table 1) illustrated 
on Figs. 1, 2 and 3 is observed. As shown on Fig.1, the nonselective component reports  N2 lines

not indicated on the figure. NO lines from the E 
(∆v  =0)  [12,13]  Rydberg-Rydberg  rovibronic  transitions  are  also  present.  The  selective 
component  is  only  made  of  NO  transitions.  In  spite  of  the  advantage  of  a  higher  frequency 
modulation, NO transitions in the selective component are seen with smaller signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) respectively reduced by a factor of 20, 6 and 7 for the E-D, C-A and D-A transitions. This 
is due Doppler shifts smaller than half-widths of line profiles [2]. With an expanded scale the NO 
C-A transition is shown on Fig. 2 in order to better illustrate the selectivity efficiency. A small 
portion of the spectrum is again expanded on Fig. 3 where the selective component appears free 
from Ν2 lines and the NO lineshapes have the expected appearance induced by the VM approach. 
In order to check that instrumental artefacts were not at the origin of this unexpected VM 
detection of NO, additional spectra listed on Table 1 were recorded. Classical spectra 3538 and 
3539 sequentially recorded with opposite dc excitations of the discharge confirmed real shifts for 
only NO lines together with their cation-like behavior. Figure 4 reports the individual lineshifts 
extracted  from  these  two  spectra  for  each  of  the  NO  transitions.  Particular  attention  was  also 
brought  to  the  possible  shift  effects  due  to  improper  optical  connection  between  the  discharge 
tube and the interferometer. DM spectrum 3540 obtained with a reduced entrance Jacquinot-stop 
(J-stop) diameter (1.4 intead of 5.7 mm) still presents the NO lineshifts with the same reduction 
factor on the respective SNR in the selective and nonselective components.  

Precursor  gas  composition  influence  was  also  examined.  Discharge  in  N2O  (spectrum 
nb.3551)  produces  similar  results  with  a  SNR  about  5  times  lower  for  the  NO  Rydberg 
transitions. SNR reduction factors from nonselective to selective components are still the same as 
in spectrum 3534 for NO Rydberg lines. Looking for a similar shift on the 1-0 vibration-rotation 
band of NO in the X 2Π electronic state revealed unsuccessful. Spectrum (nb. 3554) in the 1800-
6500  cm-1
  range  with  N2O/He  as  gas  precursors  displays  easily  observed  (1-0)  NO  and  N2O 
vibration-rotation  bands,  which  both  appear  only  in  the  nonselective  component.  When  using 
NO/He as a precursor (spectrum nb.3560), the nonselective component looks approximately the 
same as with N2O on Fig.1, but no spectral signature is observed on the selective component.  
 

3.  Tentative interpretation. 

In  summary,  with  N2O/He  as  precursors,  the  line  positions  of  the  Rydberg-Rydberg  NO 
transitions encounter an apparent systematic polarity-dependent wavenumber shift of the order of 
2 10-3 cm-1, while N2 lines with similar intensity remain unshifted. Moreover, the observed shifts 
of  NO  in  Rydberg  states  correspond  to  those  of  a  cation.  Furthermore  no  ion  transitions  are 
detected.  The  presence  of  the  NO  Doppler  shifts  is  gas  precursor  dependent.  Shifts  are  only 
observed in the experiments made with N2O or N2O + He. However, with N2O +He no shift was 
measurable in the observed fundamental 1-0 NO vibration-rotation band.   

Several  qualitative  conclusions  can  be  settled  from  the  experimental  investigations 
summarized above. Since NO line shifts are discharge-polarity dependent, they are not related to 
shifts or splittings of the energy levels (for instance, Stark effect). In the complete set of spectra 
+  and  NO+  transitions  were 
evoked  above,  no  molecular  ion  transitions  could  be  identified.  N2

specifically looked for within the explored spectral range (1800-10 000 cm-1). N2O+ could not be 
probed. All its known transitions [14] lie in the near UV range, which is not currently accessible 
to  our  experimental  facility.  Since  NO  behaves  like  a  positively  charged  particle,  the  observed 
Doppler  shifts  cannot  be  due  to  momentum  transferred  in  the  electron-molecule  collisions,  as 
already reported for H2 [5,6] and He [7,8].  
Two  hypotheses:  electron-NO+  recombination  and  momentum  transfer  in  positive  ion-molecule 
collisions, may be examined with more details. An electron - NO+ recombination could indeed be 
the origin of the observations: NO+ drifts under electric field influence and recombines with an 
electron  to  form  NO  in  Rydberg  states.  If  NO+  forms  NO  in  a  time  short  compared  to  the 
radiative  lifetime  of  the  ion,  the  absence  of  NO+  transitions  in  the  spectra  is  not  contradictory. 
Observation  of  different  Doppler  shifts  for  the  three  vibronic  transitions  could  be  due  to  state-
dependant  rate  constant.  However,  with  this  assumption,  we  did  not  find  any  satisfactory 
explanation  to  the  lack  of  Doppler-shifted  NO  transitions  when  NO  is  used  as  a  discharge 
precursor (while these intense NO Rydberg-Rydberg transitions are observed in the nonselective 
spectrum).  The  second  hypothesis  is  that  NO  Doppler  shifts  could  derive  from  momentum 
transfer  in  positive  ion  -  molecule  collisions.  The  involved  positive  ion  might  be  N2O+. 
Furthermore,  the  interaction  potential  between  an  ion  and  a  polar  molecule  is  given  [15]  by: 
V(r,θ) = -α q²/2r4 - µ q cosθ/r² , where r is the ion-dipole distance, q is the ion charge, α and µ are 
respectively  the  polarizability  and  dipole  moment  of  the  neutral  molecule  and  θ  is  the  angle 
between  the  dipole  and  the  ion-dipole  directions.  Dipole  moments  and  polarizability  [16]  of 
Rydberg states are usely larger than valence states. In particular, Ref. [17] and [18] respectively 
report  µ(NO,  X2Π  (v  =1))=0.141  D,  µ(NO,  D2Σ+)=2.21  D.  This  should  lead  to  more  important 
collisional  state  dependant  cross-sections  for  NO  when  it  is  in  Rydberg  states  than  in  valence 
states. 
With the above second assumption, a simple modelling of the lineshape has been implemented. 
Cationic molecules, drifting under electric field influence, collide elastically a given proportion 
of  the  NO  molecules  in  Rydberg  states.  Both  types  of  molecules  are  being  considered  as  hard 
spheres.  A  classical  momentum  transfer  calculation  shows  that,  after  collision,  NO  molecules 
acquire, following an equiprobable distribution, a velocity component along the electric field axis 
varying between 0 and v. As a consequence, in the nonselective component, a lineshape centered 
at wavenumber ν0 is considered to be the superposition of a non-shifted Doppler profile and of 
the  integral  on  the  velocity  distribution  of  Lorentz profiles  with Doppler  shift varying between 
+δmax ~ ν0  v/c and -δmax. VM lineshapes are derived and discussed in [2,4,19,20]. In the present 
simple calculation, a lineshape in the selective component is made of the difference between the 
sum  of  the  red-shifted  Lorentz  profiles  and  the  sum  of  the  blue-shifted  Lorentz  profiles.  In 
practice  the  non-shifted  Doppler  profile  was  numerically  determined  from  N2  line  shapes  and 
twenty Lorentz profiles were used to represent the velocity distribution. Individual line fits of a 
few NO C-A profiles in the selective and nonselective components were performed. An example 
is given on Figure 5. The fits provide a rough estimate of the proportion of the population of each 
state undergoing collisions and of the maximum Doppler shift. They are respectively of the order 
of  20  %  and  8  10-3  cm-1  (corresponding  to  a  drift-velocity  of  about  300  m.s-1).  Reciprocally, 
computed line profiles based on these parameters in dc excitation conditions enable to reproduce 
the order of magnitude of the observed Doppler shift from line position subtraction.

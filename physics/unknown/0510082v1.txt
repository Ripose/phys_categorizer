Abstract 

The  system  of  equations  of  electromagnetic  self-consistency  in  a  plasma  is 

analytically solved for the case of a two-component homogeneous plasma in the non-

 

 

relativistic approximation. 

1. Introduction 

It is shown in this paper that the equations of electromagnetic self-consistency in 

a (two-component) plasma, found in a previous paper [Ch] as being 14 equations (12 

main  equations  plus  2  auxiliary  equationsa)  in  12  unknowns,  have  a  solution  for  a 

homogeneous non-relativistic plasma, since any two of them are compatible with the 

remaining ones. 

We  expose  the  equations  and  specialize  the  problem  to  the  case  of  a 

"pressureless" plasma (strictly speaking to one without pressure gradient), in sec. 2. 

2 

We  work  necessarily  in  the  Lorentz  gauge,  since  the  equations  contain  this 

gauge. Then equation (2), without the pressure term, is solved in sec.3. 

We  insert  the  solution  found  in  eq.  (1),  and  this  is  reduced  to  a  solvable  form, 

because  of  the  equation  of  continuity,  in  sec.4,  in  which  section  we  also  introduce 

some simplifications as being necessary. 

In sec.5 we solve this equation (analytically). 

 

2. Exposition of the equations and specialization of the problem 

The  main  equations  of  electromagnetic  self-consistency  in  a  (two-component) 

plasma are [Ch]

The  two  auxiliary  equations  (3)  &  (4)  are  necessary,  since  we  used  them  in 

finding the main equations (1) & (2) respectively [Ch]. Thus we have 4+2x4 +1+1=14 

equations  for  12  unknowns

.  Ordinarily,  in  order  for  a  

system of equations to have a solution, the number of equations must agree with the 

number of unknowns. Thus it is possible in principle any two of our equations to be 

either  compatible  or  incompatible  with  the  remaining  ones.  We  will  see  that  the 

former is the case. 

Note that the equation of motion (2) can be written as

Thus,  we  see  from  (c)  that,  the  terms  containing  the  four-gradient  of  n  here  have  to  be  identified  as 

pressure forces, while the last term in (c) has to be taken as the external force due to the field. Note that 

then, if we neglect the pressure forces, we find for the "external force"

or (7)) in the absence of a pressure gradient. This is why we identify the term (8) with 

a  pressure  term,  and  this  is  why they are the same mathematically, if we equate the 

term (8) to zero. Equating the pressure term to zero amounts to setting

3. The Lorentz gauge and the solution of Eq. (2) 

First  of  all  we  have  to  work  in  the  Lorentz  gauge,  as  it  has  been  mentioned 

above. This is so because the Lorentz gauge is itself a part of the set of equations to 

be solved (these equations are valid only in this gauge). Thus we have 

0(cid:7)

.                                                                                       (16')   We

will  work  for  simplicity  in  the  non-relativistic  approximation.  But  this  fact  will  not 

affect  significantly  our  results,  because  we  are  going  to  apply  them  to  the  case  of  a 

laboratory plasma.(*)  

                                                 

(*)  Nevertheless,  there  are  cases  of  even  laboratory  plasmas  which  are  not  non-relativistic.  For 

example the electrons in the Ion-Channel Laser, which belong to a laboratory plasma, are relativistic 

[cf.  D.H.  Whittum  et  al.,  Phys.  Rev.  Lett.,  64  (1990)  2511].  Thanks  to  the  anonymous  referee,  who 

pointed it out to me. 

5 

Starting  now  the  solution  of  our  pressureless  (more  strictly:  without  pressure 

gradient)  problem from Eq. (10), we see that solving it is very simple. The solution 

immediately can be taken as

,  apart  from  the  integration  constants,  which  does  not  damage  the 

generality, since the integration constants can always be incorporated in the potentials 

(cid:26)A  because, in the Lorentz gauge (16'), we always have this gauge freedom. Here 3 

of  the  2x3=6  integration  constants  (corresponding,  say,  to  the  +  equations)  are 

incorporated  directly  in  the  potentials.  The  remaining  3  integration  constants 

(corresponding to the - equations) are set to equal zero, which means that we consider 

motion without "initial velocity". 

If we take also the k=0 equation into account, we will have

This  equation  results  in    ö  =  constant,  so  that  we  can  set  it  to  equal  zero  without 

affecting  the  equations  (1)  -  (4)  in  our  case,  the  Lorentz  gauge  (16')  thus  reducing

In fact, Eqs. (17) and (18) satisfy Eq. (2), as long as the condition (cf. (8))

constant.

Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for the absence of the pressure term (8) is 

that the charge densities, and with them the mass density, should remain constant.

6. Application 

The  solution  found  above  may  help  in  heating  a  homogeneous  plasma  in  a 

plasma  reactor  until  the  plasma  reaches  the  high  temperatures  necessary  for  nuclear 

reactions to take place. Up to now the heating is based mainly on the pinch effect. In 

this way it is possible to adiabatically compress inward the plasma, which collapses 

towards  the  axis  of  the  cylindrical  plasma  column  involved.  The  temperatures  so 

reached  are  indeed  high  enough  for  nuclear  reactions  to  begin,  but  this  mechanism 

contains in itself a great disadvantage: it lasts only for an extremely short interval of 

time. Exactly this can be overcome by the method described below.

If we are given a cylindrical column of (homogeneous) plasma of length d, as in 

Fig.1,  we  place  two  spirals  at  its  ends,  and  we  supply  them  with  two  alternating 

currents i  & i of the same direction, as in the figure, of suitable (cyclic) frequency (cid:31), 

(cid:1)
such that standing waves of  H

, with nodes at the ends and antinode in the middle, are 

created.  Thus  resonance  results  in  the  space  of  the  plasma,  between  the  spirals, 

10 

(cid:1)
concerning  the  field  intensity  H

.  This  intensity  results  of  course  from  a  vector 

(cid:1)
potential  A
(cid:1)
H

(cid:7)

(cid:1)
,Acurl

, which of course will be also in resonance inside the column. Because 

and because of the positions of the spirals, 

                                                                                                   (49) 
(cid:1)

 will be as in the figure. 

and 

(cid:1)
H

Then, because of (29) and (44), the plasma can be said to be "excited" and two 

streams  of  particles  (namely  ions  and  electrons)  of  opposite  velocities  will  be 

generated, which both will move in circles rotationally oscillating in this way about 

the axis of the cylinder (see Fig.1), since their velocities 

(cid:1)
(cid:6)v

(cid:1)
 are colinear to  A

. Thus, 

collisions  of electrons with ions (protons) will take place continuously, resulting in 

heating the plasma inside the column. 

Equating  the  right  hand  side  of  formulae  (43)  and  (45),  we  can  determine  the 

resonant 

frequency 

at  which 

the 

resonance 

takes  place,  by

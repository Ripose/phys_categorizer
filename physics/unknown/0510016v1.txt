Abstract 

 

 

 

JKR  theory  is  an  accurate  model  for  strong  adhesion  energies  of  soft  slightly  deformable 

material. Little is known about the validity of this theory on complex systems such as living cells. 

We  have  addressed  this  problem  using  a  depletion  controlled  cell  adhesion  and  measured  the 

force  necessary  to  separate  the  cells  with  a  micropipette  technique.  We  show  that  the 

cytoskeleton  can  provide  the  cells  with  a  3-D  structure  that  is  sufficiently  elastic  and  has 

sufficiently  low  deformability  for  JKR  theory  to  be  valid.  When  the  cytoskeleton  is  disrupted, 

JKR theory is no longer applicable.

A  quantitative  understanding  of  the  adhesion  of  living  cells  is  not  often  possible  and  the  study 

reported  here  is  one  of  the  rare  exceptions.  In  contrast,  the  adhesion  of  solid elastic  bodies has 
been extensively studied in the past and a complete mathematical description has been derived1. 

In  general,  when  the  contacting  surfaces  adhere  only  weakly  and  deform  little,  the  DMT 
approach2 allows prediction of the behavior of the system. At higher adhesion and deformability, 

when adhering surfaces are subject to a separating force, there is a finite, non-zero contact area at 
separation.  In  this  case,  JKR  theory3  gives  the  relation  between  the  pull  off  force  Fs  and  the 

adhesion energy Wadh via the radii of curvature of the materials. For solid, homogeneous spheres, 

this relation becomes: 
Wadh=2Fs/(3p Rm) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Where Rm is the geometrical mean of the radii of the two spheres. 
Many experimental studies on simple elastic materials have verified this description4. Similarly, 

the  relation  between  Fs  and  Wadh  has  been  derived  for  spherical  shells  by  Brochard  and  de 
Gennes5:  
Wadh=Fs/(p Rm) 

(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However, the adhesion of soft bodies such as cells is much more difficult to characterize. Several 

attempts to probe the adhesion strength of two biological cells have been made using techniques 
including  shear  flow  or  centrifugation6.  Adhesion  experiments  using  micromanipulation  were 
conducted more than a decade ago7,8 using red blood cells, which have well-defined membrane 

elasticity and a relatively simple, liquid interior. In contrast, it is much more difficult to extract 

quantitative  results  from  adhesion  measurements  involving  nucleated  cells,  which  are  often 

characterized  by  an  irregular  surface  with  folds  and  wrinkles  and  whose  interior  exhibits  a 
complex  rheology.  Chien’s  group  has  developed  a  model  inspired  by  Evans’  results9  involving 

the mechanical equilibrium of the cell membrane. Using this model, they measured the adhesion 
between  cytolytic  T  cells  and  target  cells10,11.  Treating  the  separation  of  the  cells  as  a  peeling 

process, they analyzed their experiments in terms of adhesion energies and junction avidity.  

The  present  study  involves  living  cells  which  do  not  spontaneously  adhere.  We  cause  them  to 

adhere  through  a  depletion  effect  in  the  suspending  medium.  We  show  that,  when  the 

cytoskeleton  of  the  cells  has  a  complete  3-D  structure  that  maintains  a  slightly  deformable 

spherical shape, JKR theory is applicable to relate the separation force to the adhesion energy. It 

gives  an  elastic  modulus  coherent  with  the  one  independently  measured  with  a  surface  force 

3/10/05

apparatus  and  with  those  found  in  the  literature12.  In  this  case  where  the  3-D  cytoskeleton  is 

responsible  for  their  spherical  shape,  the  cells  do  not  behave  like  shells  but  like  solid  elastic 

spheres. 

 

The general principle of our approach consists of micromanipulating two murine sarcoma S180 
cells13  with  micropipettes,  making  them  adhere  in  a  highly  concentrated  dextran  solution  and 

balancing the depletion-induced adhesion by the aspiration pressure in a micropipette.  

It  is  well  documented  that  non-adsorbing,  water-soluble  polymers  can  induce  an  attraction  of 
phospholipid  bilayers14-15.  The  adhesion  energy  Wadh  induced  by  the  depletion  of  dextran    has 
been  measured  experimentally  on  lipid  vesicles16  and  analyzed  theoretically17.  De  Gennes  has 
derived the expression of Wadh as a function of the volume fraction of polymers f :  
Wadh=(kBT/a2)f 1.5 

(3) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where kBT is the thermal energy and a the size of a monomer.  
For this study, we used a protocol similar to that used by Chien’s group11. It is described in figure 

1. Before analyzing the adhesion behavior,  we establish that the adhesion observed in polymer 

solution is due only to this depletion effect. It was already known that S180 cells are devoid of 
intrinsic  intercellular  adhesion  properties18  because  they  do  not  express  cell-cell  adhesion 

receptors at their surface. This is consistent with our observation that S180 cells brought to close 

contact  do  not  adhere  without  dextran.  In  contrast,  in  the  presence  of  dextran,  S180  cells  do 

adhere  when  they  are  mechanically  pushed  together  with  the  micropipettes.  Equilibrium  under 

zero compression is reached after this mechanical constraint is removed (after less than a second). 

Further, the observation that adhering cells separated immediately after transfer in a dextran-free 

chamber shows that no receptor was activated during the adhesion phase. This indicates that the 

adhesion of S180 cells observed here was purely a depletion effect.  

During separation, the cells appear elastic and slightly deformable (see figure 1) and the contact 

area at separation remains finite. Therefore, it is interesting to analyze the separation process with 

JKR theory and with the spherical shell model. For this purpose, it is necessary to measure the 

pull-off force.  
As shown by Yeung and Evans19, the cells may display viscoelastic behaviors that could induce 

force  gradients.  To  avoid  any  artifact  due  to  this  problem,  we  have  checked  that  the  aspiration 

force in the pipette equals the force transmitted to the contact zone: we used a direct method of 

3/10/05 

5 

probing this transmitted force by aspirating a cell in a 4-5 µm micropipette with a gentle suction 

and placing the opposite side of the cell on a spring (a microneedle with a known stiffness), the 

results of these force experiments indicate that, in the range of force, time and velocity used, the 

measured force equals exactly the aspiration one. 

 

Thus,  it  is  possible  to  test  the  validity  of  JKR  and  spherical  shell  theories  on  these  cells.  The 

separation force Fs is close to the average of the aspiration forces of the penultimate cycle n-1 and 

the last cycle n: 
Fs=  p (D Pn-1+D Pn) Rp
 
where Rp is the pipette inner radius, D Pi being the aspiration during cycle i.

The adhesion energy predicted by JKR and spherical shells theories can be calculated from the 

measurements  of  Fs  and  the  radii  of  the  cells.  These  values  can  be  compared  (figure  2)  to  the 
theoretical17 expression for the energy due to the depletion effects (eqn 3) and the experimental 
measurements16  of  that  energy.  Figure  3  shows  a  very  good  agreement  with  JKR  theory  while 

spherical shells theory does not seem to be suitable. 

To check that JKR theory is indeed valid, we have measured the variation of the contact area Rc 
during the separation process and deduced the elastic modulus K from the relation3:

where F is the (positive) pulling force. The results are plotted in figure 3 and give: K= 3500 +/- 
1500  Pa.  To  check  this  value,  we  have  conducted  Surface  Force  Apparatus20  experiments 

between  two  layers  of  cells  in  which  the  reduction  of  the  two  layers  thickness  with  the  load  is 

measured  (figure  4).  These  measurements  give:  K=  4200  +/-  1000  Pa  which  is  in  excellent 
agreement with values obtained by micromanipulation and with values from the literature12 (1-5 

kPa).  As  a  final  proof  of  the  validity  of  JKR  theory,  the  ratio  between  the  contact  radius  at 

separation and the one under zero load was measured. The obtained value is 0.65 +/- 0.12, again 

in excellent agreement with the expected one, 0.63. Therefore, the main features of JKR theory 

are verified here. This result may seem surprising as living cells in general display very complex 

mechanical behaviors and JKR should obviously not be valid for all types of cells. In the present 

case, the cytoskeleton is responsible for the shape of the cells and its 3-D elastic properties. We 

have  verified  by  imaging  actin,  tubulin  and  vimentin  filaments  that  the  S180  cells  have  an 

p
3/10/05 

6 

extended 3D-cytoskeleton (data not shown). However, elasticity is only expected of the behavior 

of  the  cytoskeleton  for  shape  changes  that  are  sufficiently  rapid  that  there  is  no  time  for  the 

cytoskeleton  to  exhibit  plastic  flow  during  the  detachment.  This  is  the  case  here.  These 

experiments lasted a few tens of seconds, whereas the time taken by a cell to regain its spherical 

shape after it has been expelled from a pipette was a few minutes. 

To  confirm  the  assumption  that  the  cytoskeleton  is  responsible  for  the  elastic    behavior  of  the 

cell, the same micromanipulation experiments were done in the presence of 0.1 µM or 1.5 µM of 
Latrunculin  B  (Lat)  which  inhibits  actin  polymerization  and  sequesters  actin  monomers21,22. 

When the cell is made more deformable by alteration (0.1 µM Lat) or disruption (1.5 µM Lat) of 

the actin cytoskeleton network, there is a drastic change in the adhesion measurements as shown 

in  Figure  5.  In  the  first  concentration,  JKR  theory  seems  to  work  correctly  at  low  dextran 

concentrations  (weak  forces)  while  it  is  not  applicable  at  higher  ones.  In  1.5  µM  Lat,  the 

measured apparent adhesion is weak and independent of the dextran concentration. In these cases, 

the  cells  present  a  much  larger  deformation  and  take  a  long  time  (up  to  several  minutes)  to 

recover  their  initial  shape  and  it  is  meaningless  to  try  to  deduce  adhesion  energies  with  the 

approach  presented  here.  The  actin  cytoskeleton  is  mostly  cortical  in  round  cells  in  suspension 

and allows the mechanical connection of the membrane to the tridimensional elastic structure of 

the rest of the cell. It is therefore not surprising that in this case JKR and spherical shell theories 

are not valid anymore.  

These  measurements  show  that  JKR  theory  can  reasonably  be  applied  to  predict  the  adhesion 

energy  of  these  cells.  Micropipette  experiments  are  ideal  to  measure  such  an  adhesion  as  the 

aspiration  pressure  gives  a  good  measurement  of  the  separation  force.  Whether  such 

measurements are valid for cells of other kinds remains open. The applicability of JKR theory to 

the  adhesion  of  other  living  cells  could  be  checked  directly  using  depletion  forces,  as  here. 

However these results suggest that the deformation of the cell during the detachment process is a 

good  indicator  of  whether  JKR  or  spherical  shells  theories  are  applicable:  if  the  cells  present  a 

small deformation with a finite contact area at separation, this suggests a nearly elastic behavior 

of the cytoplasm and therefore the likelihood that these theories will be applicable.

cultures  were  trypsinized  with  0.05%  trypsin,  0.02%  EDTA  (In  Vitrogen)  and  seeded  at 

sufficiently high density to yield a nearly confluent culture 18 to 24 h later. At that point, cells 

were  treated  with  0.01%  trypsin  in  HMF  (magnesium-free  HEPES-based  buffer  containing  10 

mM  calcium,  pH  7.4).    After  centrifugation,  the  cell  suspension  was  pipetted  gently  in  HCMF 

(calcium- and magnesium-free, HEPES-based) to yield isolated cells.  

Micromanipulation  measurements  were  performed  on  a  Leica inverted microscope  at 37°C. All 

surfaces in contact with the cells were precoated with bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml; fraction 

V,  Sigma).  Before  the  assay,  the  chamber  was  charged  with  CO2-independent  medium  (In 
Vitrogen)  supplemented  with  1%  FCS,  penicillin  (100  IU/ml)  and  streptomycin  (100  m g/ml). 

Pipettes  were  filled  with  sterile  isotonic  sucrose  solution  (300-330  mOs)  and  preincubated  in 

bovine  serum  albumin.  The  pressure  sensor  to  control  the  aspiration  pressure  was  a  Validyne,

Separation  process  (c,  d,  e):  One  cell  is  held  by  micropipette  B  under  strong  aspiration.  The 

aspiration applied to the other cell is increased and the micropipette A displaced away. Either the 

cell leaves micropipette A (c) or both cells separate (e). In the first case, the cell is reseized by the 

micropipette A (d), the aspiration incremented and the micropipette A displaced again. This cycle 

is  repeated  until  the  cells  separate  and  the  separation  force  is  deduced  from  the  last  aspiration 

pressures. During the measurements, the pipettes were moved at a velocity of about 20µm/s. The 

whole process of separation lasted one minute at most. The aspiration level on pressure employed 

in each cycle was monitored continuously.

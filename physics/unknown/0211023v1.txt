 Future  colliders  that  require  low-emittance  highly-polarized  electron  beams 
are the main motivation for developing a polarized rf gun. However there are 
both technical and physics issues in generating highly polarized electron beams 
using  rf  guns  that  remain  to  be  resolved.  The  PWT  design  offers  promising 
features  that  may  facilitate  solutions  to  technical  problems  such  as  field 
emission and poor vacuum. Physics issues such as emission time now seem to 
be satisfactorily resolved. Other issues, such as the effect of magnetic fields at 
the  cathode—both  those  associated  with  the  rf  field  and  those  imposed  by 
schemes to produce flat beams—are still open questions. Potential solution of 
remaining problems will be discussed in the context of the PWT design.

Abstract. Future colliders that require low-emittance highly-polarized electron beams are the 
main  motivation  for  developing  a  polarized  rf  gun.  However  there  are  both  technical  and 
physics  issues  in  generating  highly  polarized  electron  beams  using  rf  guns  that  remain  to  be 
resolved. The PWT design offers promising features that may facilitate solutions to technical 
problems such as field emission and poor vacuum. Physics issues such as emission time now 
seem  to  be  satisfactorily  resolved.  Other  issues,  such  as  the  effect  of  magnetic  fields  at  the 
cathode—both those associated with the rf field and those imposed by schemes to produce flat 
beams—are still open questions. Potential solution of remaining problems will be discussed in 
the context of the PWT design.    

INTRODUCTION 

Colliders presently being designed require ~ 1 nC of charge per microbunch with 
an emittance of 10-8 m in the vertical plane for both the electron and positron beams. 
The electron beam  is  required to  be polarized.  To date  all polarized  electron  beams 
for  accelerators  have  been  produced  by  dc-biased  photocathode  guns.  For  a  bias  of 
100 kV, the typical transverse emittance for a solid-state photocathode gun is on the 
order of 10-5 m for a 1-nC bunch. Primarily because of the longitudinal space-charge 
force associated with high charge density, a relatively long pulse is generated at the 
dc gun, then an rf buncher following the gun is used to reduce the microbunch length 
sufficiently to allow injection into one cycle of the accelerating rf,  where additional 
compression  can  take  place.  The  rf  buncher  increases  the  emittance  to  the  10-4-m 
level.  RF  guns  operate  with  much  higher  fields  at  the  cathode,  which  permits 
generation of short pulses without significant blow up of the longitudinal emittance, 
which in turn makes an rf buncher unnecessary. A transverse emittance of 1.2×10-6 m 
has been demonstrated for an S-band rf gun for a charge of 1-nC bunch and square-
shaped  bunch  length  of  9  ps  FWHM  [1].  In  addition,  the  potential  to  reduce  the 
transverse emittance in one plane to the 10-8-m level using an optical transformation 
[2] is being actively investigated [3].

The  proposal  here  is  to  adapt  an  rf  gun  to  the  production  of  polarized  electron 
beams  by  using  a  highly  p-doped  GaAs  crystal  for  the    cathode  and  exciting  with 
circularly  polarized  laser  light  of  the  required  wavelength  (in  the  range  of  750-850 
nm). The plane-wave-transformer (PWT) gun is chosen as a design that best matches 
the requirements  for continuously operating an NEA GaAs  crystal  in a high rf field 
for long time periods. These requirements will next be outlined. 

REQUIREMENTS FOR A POLARIZED SOURCE 

There is much experience operating GaAs crystals in dc guns biased at about 100 
kV [4]. An atomically clean GaAs crystal must be activated with Cs and an oxidizer 
to  produce  a  negative  electron  affinity  (NEA)  surface.  This  is  best  done  in  a  UHV 
chamber  isolated  from  the  gun  by  a  gate  valve,  after  which  the  crystal  must  be 
inserted  into  the  gun  without  breaking  vacuum.  For  an  rf  gun,  the  crystal  diameter 
must  be  kept  small,  typically  about  1-cm,  and  the  holder  designed  to  eliminate  rf 
breakdown. To produce  a low emittance beam, the laser spot on the cathode should 
have  a  radius  of  about  1  mm  and  a  pulse  length  that  is  (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)º  rf  phase,  which  for  S-
band is (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:6)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:18)(cid:13)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:17)(cid:20)(cid:4)(cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:21)(cid:14)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:16)(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:4)(cid:22)(cid:12)(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:12)(cid:25)(cid:4)
care must be taken to choose a cathode design that is unaffected by the surface charge 
limit [5]. For high polarization, the active layer of the GaAs crystal will be only about 
100  nm  thick,  which  ensures  that  the  low-charge  extraction  time  is  only  a  few 
picoseconds [6]. 

Successful  dc  guns  operate  with  a  vacuum  of  <10-11  Torr.  The  best  pressures 
achieved  with  presently  operating  rf  guns  are  on  the  order  of  10-10  Torr.  Some  gas 
species, such as H2O and C02, affect the quantum efficiency (QE) of the cathode more 
than others, such as H2 or CO. The dynamics of contamination and surface damage of 
the GaAs by gas molecules and ions formed in the rf cavity have yet to be explored 
experimentally. 

HV breakdowns in dc guns have a devastating effect on the QE. One can assume 
the same will happen with rf breakdowns. Thus the gun rf cavities must be designed 
and processed to eliminate this phenomenon. The rf processing must be done with a 
dummy  cathode.  Based  on  experience with dc guns, the resulting dark  current  must 
be <<1 nC per µs of rf. The large dark current observed in the BINP experiment with 
an activated GaAs cathode in a prototype S-band rf gun was attributed to secondary 
electron  emission  [7],  which  can  be  high  for  NEA  GaAs.  Reducing  electron 
bombardment as well as keeping the emission time short may prove to be crucial. 

Magnetic  fields  at  the  cathode  can  potentially  decrease  the  beam  polarization. 
Since  the  initial  spin  vector  is  axial,  transverse  magnetic  fields  are  the  principal 
concern.  Azimuthal  rf  magnetic  fields,  Bθ(r),  exist  on  the  cathode  during  extraction 
 up to R0/2, where E0 is 
that are of zero magnitude at r=0 and increase as ~

the electric field on the  cathode at the time of extraction and R0 is the radius of the 
cavity. In this proposal these fields are negligible at r=1 mm ≈ 0.025R0. 

 THE INTEGRATED PWT PHOTOINJECTOR 

An  example  of  an  S-band  integrated  PWT  photojector  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  It 
consists of a standing wave structure of ½+10+½ cells operating in the π-mode. The 
disks,  which are  suspended  from  4 water-carrying rods,  are mounted inside a large 
cylindrical  tank. The rf  power couples  first into the annular region of the tank  in  a 
TEM-like  mode,  then  couples  into  the  accelerating  cells  in  a  TM-like  mode  on 
axis—thus the name. 
 

 

FIGURE 1. The integrated PWT photoinjector. 

 

There are several reasons for choosing the PWT design over the 1.6-cell gun plus 
booster.  Parmela  simulations  indicate  that  a  peak  field  of  120-140  MV/m  at  the 
cathode is required to achieve a transverse emittance of 10-6 m for a 1-nC bunch, 10 
ps pulse. However, the growth in emittance as the peak field is lowered to 60 MV/m 
is much  less for the PWT injector. Thus for collider  applications  the PWT  injector 
can be operated at lower fields, which generally will reduce dark current and avoids 
any  field  emission  from  the  GaAs  due  to  an  inversion  layer.1  In  addition,  the 
separation of the tank from the disks improves the conductance for vacuum pumping 
and also allows a wide range of Q values  and thus filling times. Long filling times 
may reduce rf breakdown. 

For polarized beam applications, the PWT gun shown in Fig. 1 can be improved 
as follows. To reduce dark current and rf breakdown, Class 1 OFHC Cu forged using 
the  hot  isostatic  pressure  (HIP)  method  and  single-point  diamond  machining  to  a 
                                                 
1 When the field into the surface of a p-doped semiconductor is strong enough that the conduction band at the surface is bent 
closer to the Fermi level than the valence band, then the surface becomes n-type with electrons occupying states in the 
conduction band near the surface. See ref. [9] for a fuller discussion.

roughness  of  0.5  µm  or  better  can  be  used.  The  final  assembly  should  undergo  a 
simple  rinsing  in  ultra-pure  water  [8].  Vacuum  pumping  can  be  improved  by 
increasing  the  tank  diameter  and  coating  its  inner  surface  with  a  thin  film  getter 
material such as TiZr or TiZrV [10]. The increased tank diameter will also increase 
the  stored  energy,  which  is  desirable  for  pulse  trains.  It  is  possible  to  increase  the 
water cooling to handle 25 MW peak rf power at 180 Hz. The design parameters for 
a prototype PWTS-band polarized photoinjector are given in Table 1.

GaAs  crystals  must  be  prepared  to  have  an  NEA  surface  in  a  separate  UHV 
chamber, and then inserted into the gun without venting. Such systems are in routine 
use for dc-biased guns, but will require some careful development for an rf gun since 
an  rf  seal  must  be  made  while  the  crystal  itself,  which  is  quite  fragile,  must  not 
undergo significant stress. 

FUTURE PLANS AND CONCLUSIONS 

An  SBIR-I  has  recently  been  awarded  to  DULY  Research,  Inc.  to  begin  the 
engineering  design  of  an  S-band  PWT  integrated  photoinjector  with  load  lock  for 
polarized electron beams.  If this is followed by a Phase  II award, the photoinjector 
will be tested at the Gun Test Facility at SLAC. The test will be for QE in a high rf 
field  of  an  activated  GaAs  cathode  at  20  MeV.  The  QE  during  the  test  will  be 
monitored  using  a  green  laser  (532  nm)  of  2-10  ps  pulse  length.  Polarization  and 
emittance measurements will be performed in subsequent testing. 

A  PWT  integrated  rf  photoinjector  built  specifically  for  polarized  electrons  has 
many  features  that  will  be  important  for  successful  operation  of  polarized  electron 
beams. Such a gun can be built and tested in the near future.

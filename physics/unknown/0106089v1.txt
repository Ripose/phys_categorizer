A  facility  for  sub-nanosecond  time-resolved  (pump-probe)  infrared  spectroscopy  has  been 
developed  at  the  National  Synchrotron  Light  Source  of  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory.  A 
mode-locked  Ti:sapphire  laser  produces  2 ps  duration,  tunable  near-IR  pump  pulses 
synchronized to probe pulses from a synchrotron storage ring. The facility is unique on account 
of  the  broadband  infrared  from  the  synchrotron,  which  allows  the  entire  spectral  range  from 
2 cm-1  (0.25  meV)  to  20,000  cm-1  (2.5  eV)  to  be  probed.  A  temporal  resolution  of  200  ps, 
limited  by  the  infrared  synchrotron-pulse  duration,  is  achieved.  A  maximum  time  delay  of 
170 ns  is  available  without  gating  the  infrared  detector.  To  illustrate  the  performance  of  the 
facility,  a  measurement  of  electron-hole  recombination  dynamics  for  an  HgCdTe 
semiconductor film in the far- and mid infrared range is presented.  

I. INTRODUCTION 

Synchrotron radiation is the light emitted by highly 
relativistic electrons (or other charged particles) as they 
transit  the  magnetic  fields  used  to  guide  them  along  a 
closed  orbit.  The  emitted  radiation  extends  from 
microwaves  to  the  hard  x-ray  region,  and  therefore 
includes  the  entire  spectral  range  conventionally  used 
for studies of the optical properties of solids. Numerous 
beamlines  that  are  dedicated  to  infrared  spectroscopy 
have  been  developed  at  synchrotron  radiation  facilities 
throughout the world.1(cid:150)4 Most were designed to exploit 
the  very  high  brightness  of 
infrared  synchrotron 
radiation  for  microscopy  and  other  throughput-limited 
techniques.  A  few  have  been  instrumented  for  the  far-
infrared,  where  the  synchrotron  source  offers  both  a 
brightness  and  power  advantage  over  alternative 
spectroscopic sources.5 Until recently, most studies with 
the  high 
infrared  synchrotron 
brightness  of  the  source.  Grazing  incidence  methods 
for  surface  science  studies),6 
(such  as 
infrared 
microscopy,7,8  and  ellipsometry9  are  examples  of 
techniques that substantially benefit from the brightness 
of infrared synchrotron radiation.  

radiation  utilized 

A  key  difference  between  the  synchrotron  infrared 
source  and  a  conventional  thermal  source  is  that  the 
light is pulsed, with typically sub-nanosecond duration. 
These pulses are a direct consequence of the manner in 
which  a  synchrotron  operates.  The  accelerating  fields 
inside a radio frequency (RF) cavity restore the energy 
lost  by 
through  radiation 
emission. Because the RF field oscillates, only electrons 
arriving  at  a  particular 
the  proper 
acceleration,  leading  to  electron  bunching.  A  typical 
bunch length is a few cm, leading to pulse durations of 
about 100 ps.

Broadband, time-dependent measurements might resolve 
these  differences.  In  the  underdoped  cuprates,  pair

phases of high-Tc superconductors show a photoinduced

and mid-infrared regions to illustrate the capabilities of 
our system.  

II. PUMP-PROBE 

II.1 The technique 

Time-resolved spectroscopy determines a material(cid:146)s 
spectral properties at various instants of time after some 
stimulus  has  been  applied.  There  are  two  common 
approaches  for  achieving  time  resolution:  (i)  signal

gating  by  sampling  the  output  of  a  fast  responding 
photodetector or (ii) probing with a short duration pulse 
of light. Although detectors with a fast response exist for 
many  portions  of  the  spectrum,  few  are  available  that 
operate at long  wavelengths.27,28 For example, the  most 
sensitive  bolometric  detectors  for  the  far  infrared  have 
response  times  of  about  1 ms.  Consequently,  achieving 
high temporal resolution by gating the detector is simply 
unworkable. Even when fast detectors are available, the 
detector  noise  increases  as  (B)1/2  where  B  is  the 
detector’s  response  bandwidth.  Thus  the  signal-to-noise 
for  a  detector  with  B = 1 GHz  (for  achieving  1 ns  time 
resolution)  will  be  100  times  poorer  than  for  a  similar 
detector  having  B = 100 kHz  (as  is  typical  for  infrared 
spectrometers).   
Pump-probe 

established 
spectroscopy  (cid:151) 
technique  for  obtaining  high  temporal  resolution  of 
repeatable,  photo-stimulated  events29  (cid:151)  can  overcome 
these limitations.  As  illustrated in  Fig. 1, a pump pulse 
excites the sample and a probe pulse, arriving at a time 
∆t  after  the  pump,  analyzes  the  sample’s  response  at  a 
time  ∆t  into  its  relaxation  process.  The  combination  of 
pump-and-probe  can  be  repeated  at  a  high  rate,  and  as 
long as a constant delay time ∆t is maintained, the probe 
queries  the  system  in  the  same  state  every  time.  A 
complete  spectrum  can  be  measured  for  this  particular 
delay,  representing  a  "snapshot"  of  the  sample’s  state. 
This process is repeated for a wide range of ∆t values to 
build  up  a  complete  time  history  of  the  sample’s 
relaxation dynamics.

The  duration  of  the  pump  and  probe  pulses,  along 
with  the  impulse  response  function  of  the  sample,

where  Ipump(t)  and  Iprobe(t)  are  respectively  the  temporal 
intensity profiles of the pump and probe pulses and G(t) 
is  the  sample’s  impulse  response  function  (the  quantity 
of  interest).  Setting  G(t) = δ(t)  yields  the  the  cross 
correlation of the pump and probe pulses, which defines 
the minimum temporal resolution. Note that achieving a 
high temporal resolution is independent of the sensitivity 
and  response  time  of  spectrometer  and  detector.  Also, 
Eq. 1  assumes  sample  excitation  only  by  the  pump 
pulse. Typically, this is achieved by selecting the probe 
pulse  to  be  much  less  intense  than  the  pump  pulse,  but 
may also be achieved by limiting the probe to a spectral 
range below some photon energy threshold.  

II.2 Pulsed IR Sources 

Pump-probe measurements can be performed using a

commonly)  a  light  pulse.  An  ideal  facility  for  studying 

field,  or 

 

 

all  potentially  interesting  scientific  problems  would 
have  a  completely  tunable  pump  source  that  provides 
adequate  energy  density  (fluence)  to  create  the  desired 
density of excitations in the sample. Pulse duration and 
repetition frequencies (PRFs) would also be variable to 
match a specimen’s relaxation time. The probe would be 
suitable  for  high-performance  spectroscopy  over  a 
broad spectral range. Such features are never realized in 
one  single  facility,  and  concessions  are  always  made. 
Most  facilities  use  lasers  for  both  the  pump  and  probe 
sources.  Many  types  of  tunable  pulsed  lasers  are 
available for the near-IR, visible, and near UV. Optical 
parametric  oscillators  (OPOs),  which  utilize 
laser 
mixing  in  nonlinear  crystals,  provide  tunable,  high-
brightness,  pulses  spanning  much  of  the  infrared. 
However, they do not reach into the far-infrared region 
due  to  limitations  imposed  by  absorption  and  phase 
matching in the non-linear mixing crystal. Their output 
can be parametrically amplified (OPA) to provide more 
power,  but  at  much  lower  PRFs.  Free-electron  lasers 
(FELs)  are  moderately  tunable  and  have  a  high  power 
and  brightness,  but  tend  to  have  poor  stability.  Most 
have  been  built  for  the  spectral  range  above  250 cm-1 
(wavelengths  smaller  than  40 µm).  Femtosecond  lasers 
can be used to produce coherent THz pulses through the 
rapid  acceleration  of  photocarriers 
in  a  biased 
semiconductor. Such THz pulses are useful as the probe 
in  a  pump-probe  experiment,  and  provide  high 
spectroscopic  signal-to-noise.  However,  because  the 
rate  of  change  in  the  generated  photocurrent  is  limited 
to about 30 fs, the upper frequency limit for this method 
is about 100 cm-1.30 Recently, electro-optic rectification 
in  thin  chalcogenides  crystals  has  been  shown  to 
increase the spectral range to above 1500 cm-1, but the

From 

that  a  common 
limitation  of  most  pump-probe  arrangements  is  a 
restricted  spectral  range.  This  restriction  is  particularly 
onerous  if  the  system  under  study  relaxes  through  a 
wide range of energies. Synchrotron radiation, a pulsed 
continuum  source  spanning  the  spectral  regions  from 
microwaves

to  x-rays,  completely 
constraint on spectral range, although at the expense of 
temporal  resolution.  Whereas  FELs,  OPOs,  and  THz 
emitters  can  have  sub-picosecond  pulse  widths, 
synchrotron  pulse  durations  are  typically  from  tens  of 
picoseconds  up  to  about  1  nanosecond,  depending  on 
the synchrotron facility and its mode of operation.

II.3 Pump-probe and interferometry 

Most  infrared  spectrometry  is  accomplished  by 
interferometric 
a  Michelson 
interferometer,  the  incoming  light  is  divided  into  two 
beams  with  a  variable  optical  delay  (or  retardation) 
introduced into one of the beams by a movable mirror. 

techniques. 

In 

The beams are recombined, producing interference, and 
detected.  The  detected  signal  as  a  function  of  (optical) 
path  difference,  known  as  an  (cid:147)interferogram,(cid:148)  is  the 
Fourier transform of the incident light power  spectrum. 
Thus,  an  inverse  Fourier  transform  of  this  signal  yields 
the spectral content of the light. When used with a single 
element 
this  Fourier-transform 
infrared  (FTIR)  spectrometer  (or  interferometer)  has 
significant  multiplex  and  throughput  advantages  over 
diffraction grating or prism spectrometers, allowing high 
signal to noise ratio (S/N) spectra to be acquired in short 
periods of time. 

infrared  detector, 

A considerable portion of the infrared flux reaching 
the  detector  is  from  the  300  K  environment.  Because 
this  flux  is  approximately  constant  with  time,  FTIR 
spectrometers  modulate  the  desired  signal  so  that  ac 
detection  can  be  employed  and  the  background  signal 
rejected.  There  are  two  methods  for  achieving  this 
modulation. One method, known as (cid:147)rapid scan,(cid:148) moves 
the  mirror  at  a  constant  velocity  through  the  complete 
optical path difference range. A typical velocity has the 
optical path changing at about 1 cm/s. A broadband AC 
signal  results,  which  for  the  mid-IR  spectral  range 
(600 cm-1 
to  4000 cm-1)  spans  600 Hz 
to  4 kHz, 
compatible with typical infrared detector response times 
(bandwidth),  low-noise  amplifiers,  and  high-resolution 
digitizers.  

referred 

The  other  method, 

to  as  step-scan, 
sequentially  positions  the  movable  mirror  at  discrete 
intervals,  pausing  at  each  step  to  acquire  the  signal 
(often  integrated  for a  few  seconds to improve  S/N).  A 
chopper  modulates  the  beam  signal,  allowing  lock-in 
detection  methods.  This  technique  is  used  in  very  far 
infrared spectrometers where it is difficult to move large 
mirrors  at  the  velocities  needed  to  bring  modulation 
frequencies  out  from  the  detector’s  1/f  noise  regime. 
Step-scan  is  also  used  in  modulation-type  experiments 
and a class of time-resolved measurements employing a 
fast (gated) detector.  

The  sample  to  be  investigated  is  usually  placed 
between the interferometer and the detector to minimize 
false  signals  from  modulation  of  the  sample’s  own 
thermal  emission.  This  situation  raises  an  interesting 
question  for  the  case  of  a  pulsed  light  source.  The 
interferometer  necessarily  delays  one  of  the  beams  in 
time with respect to the other, so that the light traveling 
toward  the  sample  and  detector  consists  of  two  pulses 
for every pulse incident on the beam splitter. If the delay 
is short the pulses overlap temporally, but if the delay is 
sufficiently  long,  the  two  pulses  may  not  overlap. 
Although this situation  might lead to concern about the 
interference  process  and  the  possible  loss  of  time 
resolution,  it  should  not.  The  interference  process  for  a 
pulsed  source  is  no  different  than  for  a  continuous 
source.  Consider  a  spectrometer  system  with  a 
continuous,  spectrally  smooth  source  limited  to  the

In  particular,  l 

spectral  range  below  a  high  frequency  cutoff  ν0. 
Assuming  that  the  spectrometer  optics  do  not  impart 
any  sharp  spectral  structure,  the  coherence  length  for 
this  system  is  l0 = c/ν0,  which  is  the  maximum  optical 
path  difference  for  which  the  interferometer  will 
produce measurable interference. Placing an object with 
a  narrow  spectral  feature  into  the  optical  system 
changes the coherence length. If the feature has a width 
δν < ν0, then the coherence length increases to l = c/δν 
> l0 and observable interference occurs out to a greater 
optical  path  difference. 
the 
interferometer  path  difference  necessary  to  yield  a 
spectral resolution of δν. Now consider a pulsed source 
with pulse length L. When L > l (where l = c/δν and δν 
is  the  narrowest  spectral  feature  to  be  detected)  the 
situation  is  clearly  the  same  as  for  the  continuous 
source.  The  optical  path  difference  needed  to  resolve 
the spectral feature is less than the pulse length, so the 
light  from  the  two  arms  of  the  interferometer  readily 
overlap in time, producing interference as required. But 
when l exceeds L, it might seem impossible to achieve 
the  interference  necessary  for  resolving  a  narrow 
feature,  since  the  two  light  pulses  (produced  by  the 
interferometer),  no  longer  overlap  when  brought  back 
together. Fortunately this is not the case, since a proper 
treatment  of  the  sample’s  response  requires  expressing 
the  infrared  pulse  as  the  superposition  of  spectrally 
narrow  Fourier  components.  These  components 
normally  cancel  each  other  beyond  the  extent  of  the 
pulse,  but  when  separated  out  by  a  sample  having 
narrow (δν) spectral response, they persist over a length 
scale  l  =  c/δν  that  can  be  much  greater  than  L. 
Therefore interference continues out to the optical path 
difference  necessary  for  resolving  a  spectral  feature 
even when it exceeds the pulse length. High-resolution 
spectroscopic measurements performed at the NSLS, at 
MAXLAB  (Lund),  and  at  LURE  (Orsay)  synchrotron 
facilities  confirm  the  presence  of  interference  under 
such circumstances. 

the  highest 

The  other  concern  is  the  potential  loss  in  temporal 
resolution  due  to  the  time-separated  pulses  from  the 
interferometer.  Again,  we  consider  a  spectral  feature 
having width δν. The transform-limited relaxation time 
for such a spectral feature is δτ = 1/δν. This relaxation 
time  sets 
time  resolution  for  which 
meaningful  information  can  be  obtained.  To  resolve 
such a feature, the interferogram must be sampled to an 
optical  path  difference  of  l = c/δν,  imparting  a  time 
delay  between  the  two  probe  pulses  (split  by  the 
interferometer) of δt = 1/δν. Thus the uncertainty of the 
probe  arrival  time  is  the  same  as  the  transform-limited 
minimum  relaxation  time,  and  the  loss  of  temporal 
resolution is insignificant. 

Lastly,  we  note  that  the  pump  and  probe  repetition 
frequencies  (PRFs)  should  be  greater  than  the  IR 
detector system bandwidth (and the FTIR spectrometer’s 
modulation  frequency).  This  restriction  ensures  that  the

arrival of a probe pulse, and not the instant of time when 
the detector is sampled, determines the delay time and is 
equivalent to having the detector sample (average) over 
many 
rapid-scan 
modulation  frequencies  are  in  the  100  kHz  range, 
whereas PRF’s for synchrotrons are tens of MHz, at least 
two  orders  of  magnitude  higher.  Thus,  in  normal 
conditions,  each  position  of 
the  scanning  mirror 
averages over a few hundred to a few thousands pump-
probe  events.  Since  most  FTIR  systems  allow  for  a 
choice  of  modulation  frequencies,  it  is  not  difficult  to 
meet this requirement, even if a pump-probe experiment 
is performed at a very low repetition rate. The rather low 
modulation  (chopping)  frequency  in  a  step-scan  system 
avoids this problem in all practical situations.  

III. INSTRUMENTATION 

III.1 Pump-probe pulses and synchronization  

Fig. 2 shows schematically the pump-probe setup at 
NSLS.  Our  pump-probe  apparatus  utilizes  a  mode-
locked Ti:sapphire laser as the excitation source and the 
synchrotron  light  as  the  probe.  Here,  we  elucidate 
system  details.  The  vacuum  ultraviolet  (VUV)  ring  at 
the  NSLS  operates  with  a  52.9  MHz  RF  accelerating 
system.  Thus  the  minimum  spacing  between  electron 
bunches is 18.9 ns. The revolution period (time for one 
full orbit) for a single bunch around the VUV ring’s 51 
m  circumference  is  170  ns,  or  9  times  the  minimum 
bunch  separation.  Thus,  the  ring  can  simultaneously 
support  a  maximum  of  9  equally  spaced  electron 
bunches, in which case synchrotron radiation is emitted 
at  a  52.9  MHz  PRF.  Each  position  where  a  bunch  of 
electrons  can  be  maintained  is  referred  to  as  an  (cid:147)RF 
bucket.(cid:148)  The  ring  can  be  operated  with  specific  RF 
buckets  filled  and  others  left  empty.  Symmetric  bunch

patterns,  having  filled  buckets  at  equally  spaced 
intervals, are convenient for synchronizing with a laser. 
The  NSLS  VUV  ring  has  three  such  patterns;  1-bunch 
(a  single  bucket  filled  and  the  remaining  8  buckets 
empty), 3-bunch (every 3rd bucket filled), and 9 bunch, 
yielding  PRFs  of  5.88,  17.6  and  52.9  MHz 
respectively.34  For  normal  operations,  a  second  higher 
frequency RF system stretches the bunches (to increase 
the  on-orbit  lifetime  of  the  electrons),  resulting  in  a 
synchrotron  emission  pulse  length  in  the  nanosecond 
range.  When  this  bunch  stretching  is  disabled,  the 
typical  bunch  length  is  between  500 ps  and  1 ns.  This 
second RF system can also be used in special operations 
to  compress  the  electron  bunches  and  achieve  pulse 
durations of 400 ps or less. In general, the pulse length 
varies  with  electron  beam  current  in  the  storage  ring, 
but  can  be  held  reasonably  constant  over  a  modest 
range  of  currents  by  adjusting  the  degree  of  bunch 
compression  from  the  second  RF  system.  Additional 
reductions  in  bunch  length  can  be  attained  through 
adjustments  of  the  storage  ring  magnet  system35  or

reduces the high-energy cutoff for synchrotron radiation

Presently,  the  shortest  available  synchrotron  pulses,

the  VUV  ring

The  pulsed  pump  source  is  a  custom-engineered 
Ti:Sapphire  mode-locked  laser  (Coherent  Laser  Group 
Mira  900P)  producing  2 ps  duration  pulses  at  a 
repetition  rate  of  105.8 MHz  (cid:151)  twice  the  VUV  ring 
fundamental RF frequency (attempts to produce a longer 
cavity  laser  producing  stable  pulses  at  52.9 MHz  were 
unsuccessful.) The laser is tunable from 700 nm to 1000 
nm  and  delivers  an  average  power  of  nearly  1 W.  A 
Coherent  (cid:147)Synchro-lock(cid:148)  system  (also  modified  by  the 
manufacturer  for  operation  with  a  52.9 MHz  reference 
signal)  is  used  to  synchronize  the  laser’s  output  pulse 
train to the VUV ring’s pulses. For the latter, we derive a 
reference  signal  directly  from  the  storage  ring’s  RF 
is 
cavity.  This  source  of  synchronization  signal 
preferable to the use of the RF system drive electronics 
because  the  phase  relationship  of  the  latter  with  the 
electron  bunches  may  vary  with  the  degree  of  beam 
loading. The synchro-lock system mixes the pulsed laser 
output  signal  with  the  reference  signal  (doubled  to 
produce  105.8 MHz),  producing  an  error  signal  that  is 
used  to  correct  the  Mira  cavity  length.  When  the  error 
signal is driven to zero, the laser is synchronized to the 
RF reference, in this case the VUV ring pulse train, but 
at a frequency of 105.8 MHz, twice the VUV ring PRF 
of 52.9 MHz. To reduce the laser repetition rate, a tuned 
electro-optic  modulator  (EOM,  ConOptics  model  360-
40)  rejects  every  other  laser  pulse.  The  laser  power 
output  is  recovered  by  collecting  the  rejected  pulse, 
delaying it by 9.45 ns (to fall in step with the next laser 
pulse in the stream), sending  it through a ‰-wave plate 
(to  bring 
the  original 
orientation)  and  inserting  it  back  into  the  pulse  stream. 
Measurements  with  a  fast  photodiode  show  that  the 
pulses can be made coincident to within 10 ps. 

the  polarization  back 

to 

A  second  (cid:147)divide  by  n(cid:148)  EOM  (ConOptics  model 
350-60)  follows  the  first  EOM  to  enable  matching  the 
laser  PRF  to  the  symmetric  3-bunch  and  1-bunch 
patterns  of  the  VUV  ring.  Thus  the  operating  PRFs  for 
our  pump  source  are  52.9 MHz,  17.6 MHz  and 
5.88 MHz.  

An adjustable delay between the pump and probe is 
necessary  to  carry  out  a  time-resolved  measurement. 
Since  we  desire  delay  times  up  to  170 ns,  optical 
techniques  are  not  practical.  Instead,  we  employ  an 
electronic delay on the laser, taking the VUV ring pulses 
as  a  fixed  reference.  In  the  present  configuration,  a 
voltage  controlled  phase  shifter  on  the  RF  reference 
signal provides for a continuously adjustable delay up to 
9.45 ns.  Alternatively,  a  DC  signal  can  be  fed  into  the 
synchro-lock  mixer  circuit,  providing  a  comparable 
range  of  pulse  delay  settings.  Since  the  laser  pulse 
period  is  9.45 ns,  larger  delays  can  be  obtained  by 
switching the EOM to select a different pulse. Fig. 4(a) 
shows  the  laser  pulses  and  their  synchronization  to  the 
VUV  ring  light.  Note  that  the  normal  multi-bunch 
operation  of  the  VUV  ring  leaves  two  buckets  empty. 

This  detail  does  not  give  rise  to  any  detrimental  effect 
in  the  pump-probe  measurements,  although  two  out  of 
nine  laser  pulses  are  not  useful  for  the  measurement. 
Fig. 4(b)  shows  the  pulse  repetition  rate  from  the  laser 
(top curve) and  in 9, 3, and  1 bunch operations  modes 
when the laser beam passes through the EOM(cid:146)s.

FIG. 4. (a) Synchronization between laser and synchrotron pulses for
a 4 ns delay. As the synchrotron light also covers the near-infrared and

and  synchrotron  pulses.  (b)  From  top  to  bottom  105.9  MHz  laser

harmonic loop, and the solid circles are for harmonic-loop plus high-

A final important issue to consider is the accuracy of 
the  laser  synchronization  to  the  storage  ring  pulses. 
Fig. 4(c)  shows  the  measured  width  and  jitter  of  the 
laser pulses using the synchrotron RF cavity signal as a

pulses to record data at each time point and produce the 
entire pulse shape.  Timing jitter between the laser and 
the  synchrotron  reference  can  be  detected  as  scatter 
along 
(time)  axis.  The  asterisks 
correspond  to  using  just  the  fundamental  loop  of  the

synchro-lock system leading to a RMS jitter of at about 
150 ps. The open circles are for the harmonic loop, and 
the  solid  circles  are  for  harmonic-loop  plus  high-
bandwidth where the jitter is well under 50 ps.  

III.2 Pulse delivery 

Because  the  laser  is  physically  separated  from  the 
infrared  beamlines  and  their  spectrometers,  the  laser 
light is transported to a given spectrometer using a 30 m 
length  of  multimode,  graded-index  optical  fiber.  An 
advantage  of  fiber  delivery  is  the  ease  by  which  laser 
pulses  can  be  fed  to  other  beamlines  at  the  NSLS.  For 
2 ps  pulses  at  800 nm  (the  fundamental  of 
the 
Ti:Sapphire  laser),  the  intrinsic  dispersion  due  to  the 
variation  of  the  refractive  index  in  glass,  is  0.12 ps/m 
resulting  in  a  pulse  broadening  of  approximately  4 ps; 
this value does not require any dispersion compensation. 
Because our synchrotron pulses are not likely to be less 
than 100 ps long, this broadening can be neglected. The 
situation  is  different  for  a  Ti:sapphire  laser  producing 
transform  limited  100 fs  pulses.  In  this  case  30  m  of 
single  mode  fiber  broadens  the  pulse  to  about  30  ps. 
This  broadening  rises  to  about  80  ps  if  the  pulses  are 
frequency-doubled to produce light at 400 nm. In fact, as 
we use the laser with its picosecond optics, the temporal 
resolution of our complete system is determined entirely 
by  the  duration  of  the  synchrotron  pulse.  Thus,  we  can 
take Ipump(t’’) = I0 δ(t’’) and rewrite Eq. 1. as

showing that the measured response is a convolution of 
the  synchrotron  pulse  shape  with  the  sample(cid:146)s  intrinsic 
response. The nature of damping in a storage ring leads 
to a Gaussian-shaped electron bunch and probe intensity 
profile.  

Due  to  coupling  losses,  the  output  power  from  the 
optical  fiber  is  reduced  to  approximately  70 %  of  the 
input  value.  The  maximum  average  power  that  can  be 
delivered  to  a  specimen  is  500 mW,  corresponding  to 
10 nJ/pulse,  or  about  4 x 1010 photons/pulse.  At  the 
sample  location,  temporal  coincidence  between  the 
pump  and  probe  can  be  determined  using  a  high-speed 
photodiode  (150 ps  rise  time)  and  fast  oscilloscope. 
Since the synchrotron output spans the near infrared and 
visible,  a  single  detector  can  be  used  to  monitor  both 
pump and probe pulses. An example of this is shown in 
Fig. 4(a) for a pump-probe delay of 4 ns.  

III.3 Spectrometry: Infrared beamlines U12IR 
and U10A 

Before describing the particular techniques used for 
collecting time-resolved spectra, we briefly describe two 
of the NSLS infrared beamlines (designed for solid state

the spectral range from about 50 cm-1 up to 40000 cm-1,

and  is  instrumented  with  a  Bruker  IFS66v/S  FTIR 
spectrometer  that  operates  in  either  rapid  scan  or  step 
scan  modes.  U12IR  is  capable  of  similar  spectral 
coverage,  but  is  optimized  for  long  wavelengths.  The 
originally  installed  spectrometers  (a  Bruker  IFS113v 
and lamellar grating interferometer) have been replaced 
by  a  single  step-scan  instrument:  a  Sciencetech  SPS-
200  polarizing  interferometer.  The  primary  spectral 
range extends from about 500 cm-1 down to about 2 cm-
1.  Thus,  between  U12IR  and  U10A,  time  resolved 
spectroscopy  can  be  performed  for  photon  energies 
from  250 (cid:181)eV  up  to  several  eV.  In  addition,  both 
beamlines  maintain 
the 
synchrotron  source,  enabling  small  regions  (limited 
only  by  diffraction)  to  be  probed.  Though  most 
experiments are performed using pulse fluencies of less 
than  1 (cid:181)J/cm2,  an  excitation  fluence  of  100 (cid:181)J/cm2  per 
pulse can be achieved when the pump beam is focused 
to  a  100 (cid:181)m  diameter  spot,  compatible  with  optimally 
focused  synchrotron  radiation  out  to  wavelengths  of 
50 (cid:181)m.

IV. PHOTOINDUCED SPECTROSCOPIC 
METHODS 

Pump-probe  measurements  can  be  performed  by  a 
variety  of  techniques.  The  basic  approach  is  to  set  a 
particular  pump-probe  delay  and  then  measure  the 
specimen’s  spectral  response  (e.g.,  transmission  or 
reflection)  with  the  pump  source  "on"  and  "off";  the 
difference  being  the  photoinduced  signal,  ∆T  or  ∆R. 
Generally  one  plots  ∆T / T  or  ∆R / R  as  a  function  of 
frequency. The transmission or reflection can of course 
be used to compute an intrinsic response function (such 
as  the  optical  conductivity),  which  is  now  also  a 
function of time (cf., G(t) in Eq. 1). The measurement is 
repeated  for  other  delay  times  until  a  complete  picture 
of  the  decay  has  been  built-up.  As  with  conventional 
photoinduced  spectroscopy,  the  challenge  is  to  detect 
small  spectroscopic  changes,  and  high-sensitivity 
differential methods are employed whenever possible. 

technique 

that  varies  only 

Because the particular changes of interest are those 
that  occur  as  a  function  of  time,  we  employ  a 
differential 
time 
difference  between  the  pump  and  probe  pulses.  The 
pump-probe  delay  is  modulated  by  a  small  amount  δt 
around a particular delay time ∆t using a sine or square 
wave signal. Thus δS(∆t), the change in response S(∆t) 
due to modulation δt, is given by the time derivative of 
Eq. 2.

When the amplitude of the temporal modulation δt is 
small, this measurement essentially gives the derivative 
of the photoinduced signal with respect to time.  

In  our  setup,  the  synchro-lock  electronics  system 
provides  a  signal  input  for  this  purpose,  but  a  voltage-
controlled  phase  shifter  on  the  RF  reference  signal 
works  equally  well.  The  modulation  signal  serves  as  a 
reference  for lock-in detection,  with the detected  signal 
being  the  difference  in  the  system’s  response  between 
delay  times  ∆t1  and  ∆t2.  We  typically  use  a  temporal 
modulation  of  a  few  hundred  picoseconds.  In  general, 
one  may  dither  either  the  laser  (pump)  pulse  or  the 
infrared  (probe)  pulse,  but  varying  the  arrival  times  of 
electron bunches in the storage ring is not practical.  

A  key  benefit  of  this  differential  technique  is  the 
rejection of false thermal signals. Though the properties 
of  some  mounted  specimens  can  lead  to  thermal  time 
constants  of  a  few  nanoseconds,  longer  thermal  decay 
times  (larger  than  20 ns)  are  more  common.  In  these 
situations,  laser  excitation  using  a  50 MHz  PRF  causes 
sample  heating  until  a  new  equilibrium  temperature  is 
achieved.  If  the  sample(cid:146)s  optical  properties  are  a 
function of temperature, then a measurement comparing 
the  optical  response  between  laser  (cid:147)off(cid:148)  and  laser  (cid:147)on(cid:148) 
will  have  a  significant  thermal  contribution  that  may 
dominate  over  the  photoexcitation  signal  of  interest.  In 
the  differential 
is  always 
illuminating  the  sample,  maintaining  a  thermal  steady 
state. The measurement is only sensitive to those optical 
properties changing on the  ns time  scale. This situation 
is in contrast to the case where the photoinduced signal 
is  obtained  by  mechanically  chopping  the  laser  beam; 
the latter directly modulates the thermal signal as well.

Limitations in the response time of the laser system 
limit  the  dithering  frequency  to  a  few  hundred  Hz 
(depending  on  amplitude  and  choice  of  square  wave  or 
sinusoidal  modulation).  Such 
low  frequencies  are 
compatible  with  essentially  all  infrared  detectors  of 
interest (including high sensitivity bolometers for the far 
IR),  but  are  not  suitable 
rapid-scan  FTIR 
spectrometers. For this reason, step-scan interferometers 
(typical of most spectrometers for the very far IR36) are 
used in this differential technique. A different procedure 
is needed to perform a differential pump-probe measure 
with  a  rapid-scan  interferometer.  For  this  situation,  a 
number  of  interferometer  scans  (one  scan  contains  the 
full 
infrared  spectral  response)  are  collected  and 
averaged  for  a  particular  pump-probe  delay  ∆t.    The 
time difference is set to ∆t+δt and another set of scans is 
taken.  The  delay  is  set  back  to  ∆t,  and  the  entire 
procedure is repeated a number of times, resulting in an 
interleaved  set  of  spectra  for  times  ∆t  and  ∆t+δt.  The 
difference between the two sets of data is equivalent to 
the  difference  in  the  spectral  response  obtained  by  the 
lock-in  differential  measurement.  The  guiding  principle 
is  to  prevent  the  various  modulation  frequencies  from 
overlapping  and  mixing.  The  laser  and  synchrotron 
PRFs  are  greater  than  5 MHz;  well  above  the  sampling 
frequencies  for  any  interferometric  technique.  In  the

lock-in  differential  method,  the  dither  modulation 
frequency is ~ 100Hz while the interferogram sampling 
frequency  for  a  step-scan  instrument  is  usually  on  the 
order  of  1 Hz  (or  less).  In  the  rapid  scan  method,  the 
interferogram sampling frequency is between 10 Hz and

V. ELECTRON-HOLE RECOMBINATION IN  
Hg1-xCdxTe 

investigated 

As  an  example  of  the  measurement  capabilities  of 
our  system,  we  have 
the  dynamical 
response  of  Hg1-xCdxTe  (MCT).  The  infrared  and 
electrical properties of this semiconductor, an important 
infrared  detector  material,  have  been  widely 
investigated  and  are  very  well  known.37(cid:150)39  In  this 
experiment,  we  monitored 
of 
photogenerated free carriers in the MCT film. Pumping 
Hg1-xCdxTe  using  light  with  photon  energies  greater 
than  its  bandgap  creates  mobile  electrons  and  holes. 
Although  photocarrier  lifetimes  for  this  material  are 
nominally  microseconds  (for  n-type)  or  hundreds  of 
nanoseconds  (for  p-type),  the  lifetime  can  be  much 
shorter  in  the  presence  of  defects  or  a  large  surface 
recombination  rate.  Such  photocarriers  dynamics,  in 
this and other semiconductors, is intrinsically related to 
the operation of fast infrared detectors.

The  sample  consisted  of  an  approximately  10 (cid:181)m 
thick  layer  of  MCT  grown  epitaxially  on  a  Cd(Zn)Te 
substrate. The specimen  studied had no special surface 
preparation (i.e., was unpassivated) and the surface had 
been left unprotected and exposed for some time; thus,

a fast carrier relaxation could be expected due to a high 
surface recombination rate. At the laser wavelength (800 
nm), MCT has a penetration depth of about 1 µm, much 
less  than  the  MCT  film  thickness.  Therefore,  the  laser 
creates  no  photo-carriers  in  the  substrate.  300  mW  of 
laser  power  was  delivered  to  the  sample.  The  far-
infrared measurement (below 50 cm-1) was performed in 
the  lamellar  grating  step-scan  spectrometer.  The  mid-
infrared  measurements  (near  the  MCT  band  gap), 
employed the Bruker 113v fast-scan interferometer with 
Ge/KBr  beamsplitter.  The  transmission  of  the  sample 
was measured at several fixed temperatures between 4 K 
and  300  K  in  a  flow  cryostat.  Polyethylene  and  KRS-5 
windows  were  used  for  the  far-  and  mid-  infrared 
respectively.  A  liquid-He  cooled  silicon  bolometer 
(response  time  around  0.5 ms)  was  used  in  the  far 
infrared;  a  liquid  nitrogen  cooled  InSb  photodiode 
(response time of 1 (cid:181)s including its amplifier) was used 
for  the  mid-infrared  measurements.  The  measurements 
were taken during normal operations of the synchrotron 
ring. 

The  pump-probe  measurement  requires  that  the 
probe  create  a  negligible  excitation  in  the  sample 
relative  to  the  pump  pulse.  Since  the  synchrotron 
provides  light  over  a  very  broad  spectral  range,  the 
integrated  intensity  can  be  substantial  (close  to  50 mW 
across  the  entire  infrared)  and  may  create  a  significant 
population  of  excitations.  Fortunately, 
the  various 
optical  elements  (e.g.  the  interferometer(cid:146)s  beamsplitter 
and vacuum windows) reduce the intensity and limit the 
spectral  range  sufficiently  to  alleviate  this  problem  in 
most  cases.  For  those  where  it  does  not,  spectral 
bandpass  filters  can  be  used  to  constrain  the  spectral 
range to the region of interest and eliminate the problem.   
To  determine  the  overall  time  decay  of  the  sample, 
we  first  do  a  spectrally  integrated  measurement.  The 
interferometer  modulator  is  left  at  a  fixed  position 
(preferably at the zero path difference (cid:151) ZPD) and the 
detector signal is monitored for changes as the pump-to-
probe  delay  time  is  varied  around  coincidence  (zero 
relative  delay  time).  The  resulting  signal  represents  the 
photoexcited  response  averaged  across 
the  entire 
spectral  range  of  the  experiment.  From  this  we  can 
determine the total time range and interval for collecting 
specific photo-induced spectra.  

V. 2 .  Re su lt s 

In  Fig.  5  the  sample  transmission  is  shown  at  room 
temperature  and  at  77  K.  Cooling  the  sample  sharpens 
the phonons, reduces multi-phonon absorption processes 
and freezes out thermally generated carriers, all of which 
increase  the  low  frequency  transmission.  The  CdTe 
substrate  phonons  dominate  the  response  between  100 
and  400 cm-1.  The  MCT  band  gap  can  be  observed  at

confirm that the oscillator strength sum rule holds as a 
function  of  time  by  integrating  each  −∆T/T  curve  of 
Fig. 8.  The  results  are  shown  in  Fig. 9  for  both  the  far 
and  mid  IR  measurements.  The  two  curves  are  indeed 
opposite in sign. We attribute the small difference (less

We  have  presented  the  characterization  of  a  sub-
nanosecond  infrared  time-resolved  pump-probe  facility 
using  synchrotron  light.  Our  facility  can  obtain  time-
resolved  data  as  a  function  of 
temperature  and 
frequency.  A  mode  locked  Ti:Sapphire  tunable  laser 
(700  (cid:150)  1000 nm)  is  used  as  pump.  The  spectral  range 
covered  by  the  probe  spectrometers  spans  2 cm-1 
(0.25 meV)  to  20 000 cm-1  (2.5 eV).  The  capability  to 
perform  pump-probe  measurements  with  either  a  step-
scan or a fast-scan spectrometer has been demonstrated. 
A  time  resolution  of  300 ps  is  achieved  and  a  window 
for  phenomena  decaying  as  slowly  as  170 ns  is 
this 
available  at  present.  The  time  resolution  in 
technique  is  independent  of  the  intrinsic  detector 
response  time.  The  facility  is  demonstrated  in  a 
measurement  of  photo-carrier  relaxation  dynamics  for 
an  MCT  film,  where  decay  times  in  the  order  of  1  ns 
were observed.

Abstract:  Magnetic  reconnection is one of  the  most  important  processes  in  astrophysical,  space 
and laboratory plasmas. Identifying the structure around the point at which the magnetic 
field lines break and subsequently reform, known as the magnetic null point, is crucial to 
improving our understanding reconnection. But owing to the inherently three-dimensional 
nature of this process, magnetic nulls are only detectable through measurements obtained 
simultaneously  from  at  least  four  points  in  space.  Using  data  collected  by  the  four 
spacecraft of the Cluster constellation as they traversed a diffusion region in the Earth's 
magnetotail  on  15  September,  2001,  we  report  here  the  first  in  situ  evidence  for  the 
structure  of  an  isolated  magnetic  null.  The  results  indicate  that  it  has  a  positive-spiral 
structure  whose  spatial extent is  of  the  same order  as the local  ion inertial length scale, 
suggesting that the Hall effect could play an important role in 3D reconnection dynamics.

Magnetic reconnection is considered to be of crucial importance not only to space science but also 
to magnetically confined fusion studies and many basic processes in astrophysics and cosmology. 
The very concept of reconnection was at first suggested at a topologically distinct location called a 
null  point,  where  the  magnetic  field  is  annihilated  and  magnetic  energy  is  dissipated  [1,  2].  In 
magnetospheric  plasmas,  reconnection  configurations  with  nulls  in  two-dimensional  (2D) 
geometry,  i.e.,  X-points,  for  southward  or  northward  interplanetary  magnetic  field  (IMF),  have 
been  proposed  and  studied  for  many  years  [3-12].  For  an  arbitrary  IMF  orientation  however, 
reconnection  is  predicted  to  occur  along  a  field  line  linking  a  pair  of  nulls  in  three-dimensional 
(3D) geometry, called the separator, and separatrix surfaces, called Σ-surfaces or preferably fans 
[13],  generated  by  the  nulls  [13-15].  Observations  in  solar  and  other  astrophysical  plasmas  also 
indicate that reconnection is essentially three dimensional [16-19]. On the other hand, nulls and their 
3D  properties  are  as  well  of  crucial  importance  in  topology,  nonlinear  dynamics  and  the 
interaction of complex fields [20, 21]. It is therefore necessary to go beyond the well developed 2D 
literature to 3D reconnection studies. 
 
Steady state and kinematic fluid approaches have been developed in 3D reconnection studies, and 
a  few  possible  topologies  of  reconnection  with  or  without  nulls  have  been  discussed [15-18, 22-24]. 
Nevertheless,  detailed  study  of  3D  reconnection  dynamics  with  nulls  started  only  recently [25,26]. 
Furthermore,  though  null  points  have  been  reported  in  several  simulation  results  [18, 27-29],  it  is  a 
hard  task  to  find  them  either  in  satellite  observations  or  in  laboratory  experiments.  Certain 
pioneering attempts to understand the physics of 3D nulls have been made in solar plasma studies 
[13,  29-35].  Since  the  solar  magnetic  field  measurement  is  currently  limited  to  the  photosphere 
surface, indirect methods have been developed to search for magnetic nulls three dimensionally, 
such as from the observed chromospheric and coronal intensity structures [31] or extrapolating the 
3D magnetic configurations above the photosphere by solving the boundary problem under either 
a  current-free,  or  force-free  approximation  [32-34].  Magnetic  field  measurement  technique  in 
laboratory  plasmas  is  still  under  development  [36].  Thus,  the  Earth’s  magnetosphere  presents  a 
most promising site for direct observation and characterization of 3D magnetic nulls.   
 
Though providing some evidence for reconnection features [8-12], single-satellite data are not useful 
for in-situ null detection, since geometrically the topological measure of a null point in space is 
zero  and  at  least  4-point  measurements  are  needed  to  characterize  3D  structures.  With  four 
identical  spacecraft  in  elliptical  orbits  of  4×19.6  Earth  radii  (RE)  and  spacing  in  a  range  of 
hundreds to thousands of kilometers, Cluster [37] is explicitly designed for studying small-scale 3D 
structures  and  multi-scale  dynamics  in  key  regions  of  the  magnetosphere.  The  mission  thus 
provides  the  first  opportunity  to  detect  a  magnetic  null  point  in  the  reconnection  region  of 
magnetospheric plasmas. We report here for the first time the in situ evidence for a 3D magnetic 
null by the Cluster constellation. Important topological and physical properties of the null are also 
revealed by the high resolution data of the magnetic field. 
 
The event lasted from 05:00 to 05:15 UT on 15 September 2001, as Cluster traversed the central 
current  sheet  of  the  magnetotail  at  ~  (-18.7,  3.5,  -2.9)  RE  (GSM  coordinates)  [38].  While  C3 
remained  south  of  the  current  sheet,  C1,  C2  and  C4  meandered  through  the  diffusion  region 
several times. The magnetic field (B) and plasma velocity (V) data of the FGM and CIS onboard

Cluster [39, 40] (no V measurement for C2) during the interval 05:03-05:04 UT are plotted in Figure 
1. C1 and C4 first detected earthward plasma jets (Vx>0, BBz>0) followed by tailward jets (Vx<0, 
Bz<0).  A  distinct  quadrupolar  Hall  magnetic  field  component  ByB   was  clearly  present.  All  these 
characteristics  are  in  a  good  agreement  with  a  crossing  of  the  typical  diffusion  region  in 
collisionless reconnection [7] (see the schematic illustration in Figure 2a). Of particular interest is 
the  position  of  four  satellites  around  the  X-point  of  2D  projection  of  the  reconnection 
configuration at 05:03:36 UT, shown in Figure 2a. Based on reconnection theories, if there exists a 
null point in 3D geometry, it is most likely to be located within the tetrahedron formed by the four 
spacecraft (Figure 2b).   
 
The fact that the magnetic null (

) is a mathematically isolated neutral point makes it hard to 

0=B

identify the null from magnetic field data. First, right at the null, the relative measurement error is 
infinite. Secondly, in principle a single point measurement cannot distinguish an isolated null from 
a magnetic neutral line or a neutral sheet, since the null is always associated with the topological 
property of its neighborhood. In general a null point is structurally or topologically stable (in the 
sense that it is preserved when the field is perturbed), whereas a neutral sheet or line with open 
 [16] On the other hand, though a closed neutral line is also structurally stable, a single 
ends is not.
point measurement of the magnetic field across the line is still indistinguishable from an isolated 
null. To distinguish the null, there are a few methods in the literature, such as the Poincaré index 
and linear interpolation methods, first introduced to plasma physics studies by Greene  [22,41] then 
developed  by others  [ 34, 42],  to  characterize  a  null  from  data  around  it.  We  then  first  identify  the 
null  point  using  the  topological  degree  method  to  calculate  the  Poincaré  index,  the  winding 
number of a vector field in global differential topology [41]. The topological degree of a magnetic 

field  can  be  defined  as  follows.  The  magnetic  field

isolated magnetic null will be mapped as the origin of “M” space, and any closed surface in the 
configuration space can be mapped as a “balloon”, e.g., a closed manifold in the “M” space. Thus 
if a closed surface in the configuration space surrounds an isolated singular point, the solid angle 
subtended by the corresponding “balloon” in the “M” space should be 4π. Otherwise, it is zero [34, 
41].  The  topological  degree,  therefore  the  Poincaré  index,  then  can  be  the  solid  angle  (with  the 
direction of the surface) normalized by 4π. In certain previous work [34, 41], the cubic surface was 
used to as the closed surface in the configuration space to calculate the Poincaré index. For Cluster 
measurement  with  only  four  satellites,  we  then  have  to  use  the  tetrahedron,  composed  by  four 
triangles, with the spacecraft at its vertices as the closed. surface Thus the solid angle subtended 
by the “M” space mapping of any one of the three triangles can be determined by the magnetic 
field  vectors  on  its  three  vertices.  Summing  up  the  four  solid  angles  corresponding  to  the  four 

triangles  of  the  tetrahedron  and  divided  it  by  4π,  we  obtain  the  Poincaré  index.  Note  that  the 
topological degree method requires the closed surface to approach the null and the magnetic field 
inside  it  to  be  continuous.  without  significant  variations.  Furthermore,  the  more  data  points  are 
used the better result it makes. Therefore the finite distance to the null and noteworthy nonlinear 
changes of the field, as well as the data from only four points, the least number needed, would cast 
a  certain  degree  of  uncertainty  on  the  calculation.  Nonetheless,  Cluster  measurement  is  the  best

mean for three-dimensionality up-to-date. On the other hand, the numerical calculation should also 
bring an error bar to the result so that the index would not be exact integers. In this event however 
the error is up to the order of 10-6. To further justify the method, a linear interpolation method is 
then applied to reconfirm the existence of the null [41]. 
 
We  here  choose  a  tetrahedron  with  the  four-spacecraft  being  its  vertices  as  the  closed  surface 
(Figure 2b), and calculate the Poincaré index with simultaneous 4s-resolution magnetic field data. 
Figure  2c  shows  the  result  indicating  that  the  Poincaré  index  is  0.9793,  very  close  to  unity  at 
05:03:36 UT. Using intercalibrated simultaneous high resolution (0.04s) magnetic field data of the 
four spacecraft (shown Figures 3a-3d) from 05:03 to 05:04 UT, we find the same result, i.e. the 
Poincaré index becomes unity for a brief interval around 05:03:36 (see Figure 3e), the error is up 
to the order of 10-6. On the other hand, outside this interval the Poincaré index is always found to 
be  zero.  These  results  demonstrate  the  evidence  of  an  isolated  null  point  presented  within  the 
tetrahedron. Furthermore, making use of the linear interpolation from the four spacecraft data and 
assuming a constant gradient of magnetic field inside the tetrahedron, we can approximately locate 
  is 
the position of the magnetic null if it exists. For example, at 05:03:36 UT, a point with 

0=B

indeed  found  inside  the  tetrahedron  at  (85.3,  -81.5,  901.5)  km  relative  to  C3  at  (-119264.3, 
22423.1,-18303.8)  km  (GSM  coordinates).  These  strongly  support  the  early  topological  analysis 
of  Poincaré  index  (see  Figure  2c),  confirming  the  evidence  for  the  existence  of  the  null  point 
inside the tetrahedron.   
 
The  high  resolution  magnetic  field  data  are  also  used  to  further  analyze  the  3D  structure  in  the 
vicinity of the null.   
 
Shown in Figure 3a (By), 3b (Bz) and 3d (Bz), a bipolar magnetic structure was detected during the 
interval  05:03:33-05:03:40UT.  The  bipolar  structure  may  indicate  a  satellite  crossing  of  either  a 
reconnection location or a flux tube. Since the crossing occurs immediately after the plasma flow 
reversal from earthward to tailward and with a positive Bx, i.e., the Cluster spacecraft moved from 
Quadrant  (II)  to  (I),  it  is  clear  that  the  flux  tube  is  only  located  in  Quadrant  (I)  of  the  diffusion 
region marked in Figure 2a where BBx>0 and Vx<0. Therefore it is unlikely that the bipolar structure 
shows a reconnection site traversing, but a flux tube.   
 
The bipolar structure also cannot be explained as a local flux rope formed in 2D reconnection. As 
shown  in  Figure  4a,  since  the  satellites  are  traveling  tailward  relatively  to  the  structure,  in  the 
magnetotail, if it were a flux rope crossing in 2D reconnection frame, then the Bz component of 
the bipolar structure should have changed from negative to positive, while the direction of the By 
component should not have changed. The observed bipolar component shown in Figures 3a , 3b , 
and 3d however always changes from positive to negative. This is no doubt a great challenge to 
conventional 2D reconnection models. The other challenge is the axis orientation of the flux tube, 
which  is  typically  in  the  y-direction  for  2D  reconnection  in  the  magnetotail.  Due  to  the  relative 
satellite  position  in  the  x-direction  as  shown  in  Figure  2a,  such  a  2D  bipolar  structure  with  a 
y-direction  axis  would  have  been  first  detected  by  C4,  then  C2  and  C1,  as  shown  in  Figure  4a. 
However, the tube in fact is detected first by C2, and then by C4 and C1 three seconds later (see 
Figure 3a, 3b and 3d). Applying the minimum variance analysis (MVA) method [43] to C1, C2 and

C4 data, we are able to show in Figure 4c that the axis orientation of the flux tube lies basically in 
the  x-z  plane,  but  not  in  the  y-direction  (φC1=206.10,  θC1=40.50; φC2=199.70,  θC2=71.50; φC4=185.80, 
θC4=90.20 in GSM coordinates). Meanwhile, during the flux tube crossing of the Cluster satellites, 
the dominant plasma flow is almost anti-parallel to the y-axis (e.g., V4x = -119.5 km/s, V4y = -605.2 
km/s, V4z = 72.6 km/s as shown in Figure (1b) and (1g)), the perpendicular (to the flux tube axis) 
is  V4⊥,y  =447.8km/s.  Therefore  the  distance  of 
component  of  V4

  could be passed by V

4⊥,y in about 3.5 seconds. In fact, C4 sees the 

structure  ~3  seconds  later  than  C2,  as  shown  in  Figure  4b.  This  strongly  suggests  a  y-direction 
crossing, but not the x-direction crossing. The relative motion of C1 is similar to C4. 
 
Thus,  to  understand  the  observed  features  of  the  flux  tube,  we  combine  the  axis  orientation 
analysis  with  the  spiral  property  of  the  flux  tube  characterized  by  the  polarity  of  the  bipolar 
component variation presented in Figure 4c. We can then infer a 3D structure in the vicinity of the 
null  as  shown  in  the  cartoon  of  Figure  4d.  To  further  understand  this  structure  and  its  spiral 
orientation, a topological model can be applied. In the model the topological property of the null 

can  be  obtained  from  the  eigenvalues  of  the  matrix

the 3D isolated null in the diffusion region observed at 05:03:36 UT is positive spiral type [13] with 

a spine in the x-z plane (determined by eigenvector of 

3λ ). Of course there are still uncertainties 

in the linear interpolation approximation if the magnetic field varies dramatically in the region. To 
justify the approximation, we apply the constraint:  ∇ ⋅B   as a test of the accuracy. In this event it 
is up to 10-5 based on

Furthermore, the intercalibration of the magnetometers is good to 0.1 nT [39], and in a field of 
order 10-20 nT, the accuracy of FGM measurement is about 1 part in 100 or 200. Even though, 
with this accuracy level, the characteristic of the null point is reliable, because it only depends on 

the signs of the eigenvalues, particularly the real eigenvalue (

3λ   in this paper).

Figure  4c  shows  a  sketch  of  the  separatrix  surface  structure  and  the  spine  of  the  positive  spiral 
type null. [13, 15, 22] The axis orientation of the flux tube calculated above in MVA from C1, C2 and 
C4  data  matches  the  spine  coincidentally.  The  geometrical  structure  of  the  magnetic  field  lines 
around the positive spiral type null is schematically illustrated in Figure 4d, where the magnetic 
field lines spiral around the spine and form a flux tube. Obviously the theoretical structure of the 
null  is  in  agreement  with  the  bipolar  polarity  and  axis  orientation  of  the  flux  tube  very  well. 
Therefore the bipolar structure can be naturally identified as the spiraling field lines generated by 
the null along the spine. Also significantly, in the above observation the maximum cross section 
size  of  the  flux  tube,  i.e.,  the  width  of  the  localized  current  density  profile,  can  be  estimated  as 
~1500km  for  a  bipolar  structure  crossing  interval  of  ~2.5  seconds  with  a  crossing  velocity  of 
~600km/s.  Then  the  upper  limit  of  the  spine  flux  structure  size  is  about  the  order  of  local  ion 

inertial length 

id

  (

≈

509km

  in this case [38]).   

 
The existence of nulls is of fundamental significance to the 3D reconnection process. It is also of 
crucial importance in vector field topology and the interaction of complex differential manifolds. 
We  have  used  full  3D  in  situ  measurements  from  the  four  Cluster  spacecrafts  at  high  time 
resolution  to  reveal  the  evidence  of  a  magnetic  null  in  the  geomagnetotail.  The  challenge  in 
identifying a 3D null is theoretically the geometrical measure of a spatial null is zero. Nevertheless, 
we  have  been  able  to  show  the  evidence  of  the  null  by  using  the  Poincaré  index.  We  have  also 
been  able  to  characterize  the  properties  of  the  local  structure  through  analysis  of  the  magnetic 

difference matrix, δB, concluding that the magnetic null is a positive spiral type point. Besides the 
topological  features,  the  analysis  of  spacecraft  in-situ  measurements  also  shows  that  the 
characteristic size of the spine structure is about the order of the local ion inertial length, a result 
not  previously  reported  either  in  observations  or  in  theory  and  simulations.  This  ion  inertial 
scaling  of  the  null  structure  shows  that,  similar  to  2D  reconnection,  3D  reconnection  in 
collisionless plasmas is most probably similar to 2D reconnection in being dominated by the Hall 

effect  featured  by  the 

-scaling 

[47,  48].  It  should  be  fundamental  to  the  dynamics  of  3D 

id

collisionless reconnection around nulls.   
 
With only one null point identified, we can not establish if there are any other nulls or null-null 
lines existing in the diffusion region nor can we suggest which 3D reconnection model with nulls, 
namely  fan  reconnection,  spine  reconnection  or  separator  reconnection  [13, 15-17, 22],  is  present  in 
this event.  Furthermore,  lacking of  high-resolution  plasma  data,  we must  look  forward  to  future 
work to characterize plasma dynamics in 3D reconnection around the null.

Figure 1: The 4s resolution magnetic field (B) and plasma velocity (V) data of C1-C4 (no V2 data) 
during the interval 05:03-05:04 UT on 15 September 2001. Four-spacecraft crossing of a typical 
diffusion  region  from  earthward  (Vx>0,  Bz>0)  to  tailward  (Vx<0,  BBz<0)  can  be  identified.  The 
vertical blue line through all panels at 05:03:36 UT identifies a time of particular interest when 
the satellite positions surround the reconnecting point (V1x>0, V4x<0).

Figure  4:  Cartoons  of  a  positive-spiral-type  null  and  positions  of  satellites  crossing.  (a)  A 
schematic illustration of the tailward crossing of a flux tube in a two dimensional model where the 
polarity of the observed field is shown changing from negative to positive (i.e. a bipolar signature 
as plotted above left) as the spacecraft motion relative to the structure follows the arrow shown in 
the lower portion (b) A schematic illustration of the Cluster satellites crossing the flux tube in the 
–y-direction  (again  following  the  green  arrow)  where  the  bipolar  signature  is  shown  changing 
from positive to negative; (c) The axis orientations of the bipolar structure in GSM coordinates, 
presented in dashed lines and calculated in MVA method from data measured by C1 (black), C2 
(red)  and  C4  (blue)  (φC1=206.10  ,  θC1=40.50; φC2=199.70,  θC2=71.50; φC4=185.80,  θC4=90.20),  as 
well  as  the  orientation  of  the  spine  line,  shown  in  the  green  line  and  calculated  as  φ0=169.50, 
θ0=20.30  by  the  eigenvector  with  the  real  eigenvalue  of  δB  matrix  at  05:03:36  UT,  clearly 
matching  the  axis  orientations  coincidentally.  It  illustrates  a  positive-spiral-type  null  geometry 

with its fan (Σ-surface) and spine line (γ-line). (d) The spiral structure of the magnetic field around 
the null.

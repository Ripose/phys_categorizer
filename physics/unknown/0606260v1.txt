Abstract
A new type of pulse high voltage electric discharge through a thin conducting layer on the surface of glass plate
has been investigated. The afterglow plasma of this discharge forms quasi-spherical object with a lifetime about
0.2–0.3 s. Electric properties of the objects were studied by electric probe method. Measurements of plasma
radiation spectra  kinetics  at  visible  and near  ultraviolet   spectral  ranges  have been  carried  out.  Comparative
analysis of the physical properties of the plasmoids appearing in this discharges and of ones generated via thin
metal wires burning is  given. Possible mechanism of the plasma  metastability are discussed.

1. Introduction
Recently a particular attention is attracted to autonomous long-living plasma formations
arising at different types of erosional electric discharges which have a seeming resemblance
with   the   ball  lightning  (BL)  at   beginning  of   their   living,   namely,  a   quasi-spherical   form,
average size about 10 cm and sufficiently bright luminescence. There exist several ways to
generate similar objects, for example UHF discharge [1], electric explosion of a thin metal
diaphragm  [2],  high-voltage   erosive   water   discharge   (HVEWD)   [3,4],   non-stationary
discharge from a 380V power mains (RPMD) [5,6], burning of thin metal wires by electric
discharge (MW) [5,7]. 

In [6] we have pointed out that these dust-gas fireballs have only partial (but possibly
deep)  similarity with the natural  ball  lightning and can be interesting only on three main
aspects: the nature of energy storing, of radiation and shape stability of some possible BL
types.   In   paper  [4]  we   have   revealed   the   physical   nature   of   such   formations   as   objects
appearing due to structure-energy self-organization processes of chemically-active non-ideal
plasma with smallest metal and/or dielectric particles. 

Fireballs generation via a high-voltage discharge through thin conducting layers (TL) was
proposed   by   us   in   [5].   The   present   paper   is   devoted   to   the   further   studies   of   physical
properties TL plasmoids, as well as of the MW ones.

2. Experimental setup
The discharge circuit  consists  of  a pulse storage capacitor  0.9 to 2.55 mF  x 5kV, an
inductance L= 40μH – 7.6mH integrated with pulse ignition transformer (resonance frequency
0.03 – 0.3MHz, pulse voltage up to 50kV), current limiting resistor (R=10–400 Ω), protecting
spark gap (4 mm in length) and main discharger (TL or MW).

TL discharger had a dielectric base on which two poles were installed with a dielectric
partition between them.  To the each of the poles at height 100 mm narrow dielectric support
was   fastened   with   possibility   to   turn   around   parallel   horizontal   axes.   Glass   plates
100x25x2.4 mm with thin conducting SnO2 layer and current-carrying electrodes (copper foil)

placed above the layer were fixed on the supports by slats. Viewed from the side the glass
plates had the form of the greek letter Λ. Resistance of the plates was varied in the range from
150 up to 300 Ω.

MW discharger had a similar construction, see [5].
For   studying  the   discharge   and   the   afterglow   plasma   spectrum   dynamics   we   used   an
original   spectrograph   described   in   [6].   The   spectrograph   enabled   to   register   the   spectral
distribution along the vertical direction at the spectral range 380–650 nm on a camcorder Sony
DCR-TRV11E with the frame rate 50 field per second, the maximal spectral resolution being
~0.5   A.   As   a   reference   source   a   He-Hg   lamp   with   a   reflector   was   installed   behind   the
discharger. We carried out simultaneous video recording of the objects via another camcorder
Sony DCR-HC30E. 

Electric properties of the fireballs were studied via electric probe method. Several types of
single and double probes were used. The probes were connected to a two-channel oscilloscope
C1-83 through a resistive divider with input impedance 150 MΩ.

3. Experimental results.
3.1. General overview of the TL discharge. 
The discharge processes and the fireballs evolution is similar to MW, RPMD or HVEWD
ones. After discharge ignition a plasma cord appears, on the top of which a mushroom-like
object   formes.   After   current-breaking   the   object   turns   into   a   plasmoid   of   oval   or   of   an
irregular shape, see Figs. 1–3 below. 

Fig.1. Evolution of a TL fireball. Time interval between frames is 20 ms. The current breaking occurs on the
second frame (180 ms after the ignition). The wires are before and behind the object, it does not touch them.

It should be noted that the shape of plasmoids is strongly depends on some aerodynamic
factors, primarily on presence and structure of airflows, disposition of surrounding objects, as

well   as   on   the   ignition   parameters   and   characteristic   time   of   the   discharge.   At   optimal
combination of these factors enables to generate the plasmoids of a quasi-spherical shape, but
for   TL  discharge  it   is  sufficiently  more   difficult   then  for   MW   or   RPMD   ones.   Also,  no
apparent correlation was found between shape and lifetime of TL fireballs. Relaxation of the
objects can occur in two different ways. In most cases they turns into plasma torus (Figs. 1,2),
their luminescent lasts ~ 0.2 s, while the residual dust toroid exists up to 1–2 s. Sometimes
during the relaxation stage objects decreases in size with formation of a more bright oval area
in the center, their shape becoming irregular. 

Comparison of  Fig.2 below and Fig.7 of paper [6] shows that surface tension of  the TL
objects is sufficiently weaker then in the case of RPMD ones, due to a lower concentration of
dust particles. 

Fig.2. Relaxation of surface tension of a TL plasmoid. Indicated time is counted off from the discharge ignition.

Fig. 3. Cotton wool firing by a TL plasmoid.

Similarly to RPMD, MW and HVEWD fireballs, at the beginning of the relaxation stage
TL plasmoids are capable to set fire on cotton wool, but they can not set fire on a sheet of
newsprint or burn through a thin aluminium foil. 

3.2. Electric properties of TL and MW plasmoids
By evidences of eyewitnesses, the natural BLs have some unusual electric manifestations,
which seems to be related with a large uncompensated electric charge. Our investigations
shows   that   none   of   type   of   the   objects   (TL,   MW,   RPMD,   HVEWD)   have   similar
manifestation. 

Firstly, it should be noted that at the same conditions the form and amplitude of probe
signal were sufficiently varying from one experiment to another. It is most probably connected
with low reproducibility of the shape, the internal gas-dynamics and the structure of fireballs
and of its position relative to the probe.  

For single probe measurements we used the following type of the probe: (a) a thin wire
with uncovered end 3 mm in length, orientated vertically or horizontally; (b) a horizontal
located copper foil plate 15x15 mm; (c) a horizontal located copper foil plate 100x100 mm;
(d) the same plate but located vertically. Fig. 4 shows a signal from a TL fireball obtained
with the probe (a). A pulse at ~150 ms corresponds to an interference at the moment of the
current breaking, small sinusoidal components are noise from 50 Hz power main. The probe
was located at the height 160 mm above the glasses tops. The sharp peak corresponds to the
moment   when   the   upper   part   of   the   object   attained   the   probe   (~25 ms   after   the   current
breaking, which is  also confirmed by simultaneous video recording; so, the object can be
considered as autonomous). The measured peak voltage was ~56 V. Taking into account that
input impedance of the divider Rd  = 150 MΩ, we find by integrating   the signal that total
charge passing to the ground is about  3 nC.  In general, the average charge was about 1.5 nC
for TL objects and 2 nC for MW ones. Its polarity always corresponds to the one of the power
supply ungrounded terminal. 

Fig. 4. Typical signal from a TL object registered with single electric probe.

In some cases two or three successive peaks were observed, which shows that only a part
of the total charge of the plasmoid is taken by the probe. So, it is probable that the trailing
edge of the pulse (which is an exponential decay with a characteristic time ~ 9 ms) is related
to the conductivity decrease rather then to discharging of the object by the probe. The video

recording gives the object vertical velocity ~0.75 m/s, hence the thickness of the conductive
envelope is ~ 7 mm. 

Assuming   that   the   probe   current   is   limited   by  the   plasma   conductivity  we   find   total
resistance of the discharge circuit is about Rt= 9 ms/6 pF = 1.5 GΩ >> Rd , so the real plasma
potential is 56 V * Rt/Rd=560 V, which is about a half of the storage capacitor voltage at the
moment of  the current breaking. 

For MW objects, the use of probes (a), (b) and (d) give similar signals, their amplitude
being generally 25% greater then for the probe (a) on TL objects. For TL objects no signals
were registered with (d) probe, but amplitude of the 50 Hz noise increased in several times
after the object had touched the probe and remained at this level during more than 250 ms (a
similar but weaker effect can be seen even for (a) probe, see Fig. 4). Signal from probe (c) has
low amplitude ( 8 – 12 V in the best cases) and longer duration (~ 45 ms and more). Total
collected charge was ~2.5 nC in the best cases. 

For   double   probe   measurements   we   used   a   vertically  located   twisted   pair   cable   with
horizontally bent uncovered ends placed at different heights at the right angle. The height
difference   between   the   ends   was   varied   from   3   to   20   mm.   Each   wire   of   the   cable   was
connected   to   through   identical   resistive   dividers   to   the   corresponding   channel   of   the
oscilloscope operating at differential or alternate (switching frequency 500 KHz) mode. 

For MW objects at the differential mode the signal was similar to one shown on Fig. 4.
Measurements at the alternate mode shows that the upper probe gives very low signal, so the
differential one was almost entirely due to the low probe.

So, we can conclude that both MW and TL objects obtain their charge from the discharge

plasma cord; self-generated field of the objects, if present, is sufficiently lower.

3.3. Spectral characteristics of  TL and MW discharges and objects
Spectra of TL and MW discharges and objects from UV to red spectral ranges are shown
on   the   figures   5   –   20.   When   a   discharge/objects   spectrum   was   located   on   the   image   at
sufficiently far from the reference one, a part of the image between them was cut out, on the
corresponding figure the spectra are separated by a white line and reference lines are marked
(Ref *) (otherwise – simply (Ref)). In this case especially a circular distortion should be taken
into account when analyzing the spectra. Note that the time from discharge ignition when a
spectrum was taken could be evaluated (by analyzing corresponding parallel videorecording
of the discharge) only approximately, so the error can be ±10 ms and more, the same refer to
the current breaking moment.

For   TL  the  spectral   range  are  divided  into   five   overlapping   subranges:  3700–4390 A,
4340–5040 A, 4980–5490 A, 5400–5920 A, 5850–6475 A. MW spectra were taken with a
lower resolution and are divided into three subranges: 3735–4900 A, 4850–5920A, 5850–
6410 A.   Note   that   the   camcorder   sensitivity   decreases   rapidly   from   3800 A   to   shorter
wavelengths.  

In paper [6] the presence of short-living and long-living components was found in the
RPMD discharge radiation. For TL and MW ones the situation is similar. Fig. 5 shows the
presence of a molecular bands CN 4216.0, 4197.2, 4181.0 in the TL discharge spectrum in
~30 ms after the ignition; a band at λ≤3890 is most likely also due to CN. They disappear in
~40 ms, see Fig. 6.   Lines 3968 A and 3933 A belong most likely to Ca II ion (ionization
energy 6.11 eV), i.e. 3968.47 (Eex=3.12 eV) and 3933.67 (3.12 eV), but the  presence of  a
residual Fe impurity cannot be totally excluded. Ca I lines, marked (1)-(6) on the Fig. 6,  are
4318.65 (4.77 eV), 4307.74 (4.76 eV), 4302.53  (4.78 eV), 4298.99  (4.77 eV), 4289.36  (4.77
eV), 4283.01  (4.78 eV).

The line Ca I 4226.73 (2.93 eV) is present during the whole discharge; it is a unique

atomic line at this range visible after the current breaking, see Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. TL object spectrum at UV–Blue range (3800 – 4390 A)  just after the current breaking (~190 ms after the
ignition). This image was processed to increase the brightness.

Radiation of both the discharge and object at blue-cyan range (4340–5040 A) is mainly
due to AlO bands, but in bright lines of Ca I and Sr I are present, some of them can be seen
still just after current breaking (see Figs. 8, 9).

Fig. 9. TL object spectrum at Blue-Cyan range (4340 – 5040 A)  just after the current breaking (~190 ms after

The MW discharge spectrum at UV-Cyan range is rather different (Fig.10). Because of the
lower resolution some lines and band can not be surely identified. Very bright lines Cu I
4062.7 (6.87 eV),   4063.29   (6.87 eV),  Ca I  4226.73  and bands CaO 4221.9,  NO2 4448.0
are present.

Fig. 10. MW discharge spectrum at UV–Cyan range (3735 – 4900 A)  in ~60 ms after the ignition.

The   MW   object   spectrum   (Fig. 11)   includes   several   unidentified   bands   at   4470–4790

(possibly, due to Cu2O) and the line Ca I 4226.73.

. Fig.11. MW object spectrum at UV–Cyan range (3735 – 4900 A)  ~ 10 ms after the current breaking (~200 ms
after the ignition).

At the cyan-yellow range (4890–5920) the TL discharge spectrum (Figs. 12, 14) is formed
by Cu I lines 5105.54 (3.82 eV), 5153.24 and 5218.20 ( 6.19 eV), 5292.52 (7.74 eV), 5200.87
(7.8 eV),   5700.24   (3.82 eV),   5782.13   (3.79   eV),   Mg   I   lines   5183.61,   5172.68,   5167.33
(5.11 eV),   and   Na   I   lines   5889.95   (2.11 eV),   5895.92   (2.10 eV)   together   with   weaker
molecular   bands   which   are   possibly   due   to   CuO   and   Cu2O.   In   the   afterglow   spectrum
(Figs. 13, 15) just after current breaking the line Cu I 5105.54 (3.82 eV) is visible, but then
only Na I lines remains.

The MW discharge and afterglow have sufficiently higher intensity at this spectral range,
see Fig. 16, 17.    In the afterglow several Cu I lines are visible as well as molecular bands
belonging most probably to CuO and Cu2O. 

At the red-yellow range TL and MW discharges and afterglows have similar spectra (see
Figs. 18–20), but MW ones have higher intensity. The afterglow is mainly due to Na I lines
and CuO bands.

4. Conclusions

The results of our researches presented in this article confirm main ideas stated in our
paper [6]. Summarizing them and also taking into account results of [5,7], we arrive at the
following conclusions:

all   laboratory  fireballs,   i.e.   MW,   TL,   RPMD   and   HVEWD   objects   have   only
partial similarity to the natural phenomenon;
the   afterglow   luminescence   has   a   non-thermal,   non-equilibrium   and   collective
character;   the   metastability  of   the   objects   is   supported   by  a  catalytic  decay  of
chemically active plasma created during the discharge; 
the objects obtain their charge from the discharge plasma cord, their self-generated
electric field, if present, is sufficiently weaker;
presence or absence of an electric charge of the objects, as well as proximity their
shape to spherical one, have no apparent influence on the afterglow duration.

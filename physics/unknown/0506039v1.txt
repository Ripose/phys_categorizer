Abstract 

 

 

We study the effect of rotation on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in slow-light 

waveguide structures consisting of coupled micro-ring resonators. We show that such 

configurations exhibit new a type of the Sagnac effect which can be used for the 

realization of highly-compact integrated rotation sensors and gyroscopes.

When an electromagnetic wave propagates in a moving medium it accumulates additional 

phase shift, compared to a wave propagating in a stationary medium, which depends on 

the scalar product between the wave propagation direction and the velocity vector of the 

medium [1, 2]. A particularly interesting configuration is that of a wave propagating 

along a circular path in a rotating medium. In such scenario, the additional phase 

accumulated by the wave depends on the relation between the propagation directions of 

the medium and the wave (co-directional or counter-directional). This phase difference is 

often referred to as the Sagnac effect and in addition to its scientific importance, it has 

numerous practical application such as detection and high-precision measurement of 

rotation.  

In the past few years, much attention was devoted to slowing down the propagation speed 

of light and to coherently stop and store pulses of light [3-6]. There are two major 

approaches to achieve significant reduction of the group velocity of light, which employ 

either electronic or optic resonances. Because of the inherent constraints associated with 

the conversion of the optical signals to coherent electronic states, the electronic resonance 

approach is less attractive for practical implementations of slow-light devices. 

Consequently, significant efforts were focused on controlling the speed of light using 

photonic structure incorporating microcavities and photonic crystals. Substantial delays 

and storage of light pulses were predicted in various coupled-cavities structures such as 

coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) [7] and side-coupled integrated spaced 

sequence of resonators (SCISSORs) [8]. 

Recently, Leonhardt et al. pointed out the advantages of using the Sagnac effect is slow-

light medium generated by electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) for the 

realization of an ultra-sensitive optical gyroscope [9]. Subsequently, Steinberg studied the 

effect of rotation in coupled photonic crystal defect cavities [10] and Matsko et al. 

proposed to utilize the dispersive characteristics of slow-light propagation in a closed 

loop SCISSOR-like configuration to realize a high-sensitivity miniaturized optical 

gyroscope [11]. In that study, however, the SCISSOR was modeled as a highly-dispersive 

conventional waveguide where the slow group velocity of the light in the SCISSOR 

stems from the average interaction of the light with the high-Q resonators. 

In this letter, we study the properties of the Sagnac effect in a CROW which is wrapped 

around itself, with application for a highly compact rotation sensor or an optical 

gyroscope. Figure 1 illustrates the geometrical configuration: light is launched into the 

input waveguide and equally divided between the two channels of the 3dB coupler. The 

signal in each arm is coupled to a different end of the circular CROW consisting of 

directly coupled ring resonators. Finally, the counter propagating signals (marked by the 

black and white arrows) are combined by the 3dB coupler where the output signal in each 

arm of the coupler depends on the relative phase difference between the signals:

where Ein and ∆φ are correspondingly the input amplitude and the phase difference 

between the counter-rotating fields. When the device is stationary, the overall phases 

accumulated by both signals are identical i.e., ∆φ = 0, resulting in complete cancellation 

of Br. On the other hand, when the device is rotating, the phases accumulated by the 

signals differ, resulting in a non-vanishing intensity Br. 

To evaluate the phase difference ∆φ in a CROW it is convenient to divide the structure 

into sections as illustrated in Fig. 1: An input section which consists of the input coupler 

and part of the first micro-ring (this section is marked by the dashed white line “I”); A 

recurring section consisting of two halves of a micro-ring coupled to a complete ring, 

constituting the main body of the CROW (this section is defined by two successive 

dashed white lines: I→S1, S1→S2, etc.); And an output section which is similar to the 

input section (from the line marked by “O” to the output coupler). Because of the 

recurring section, it is convenient to represent each section by a transfer matrix linking 

between the input and output ports of the section. The overall transfer matrix of the 

structure is then found simply by multiplying these matrices in the correct order. 

The phase accumulated by a wave propagating in non-stationary waveguide depends 

primarily on the scalar product of the waveguide velocity and the wave-vector k. In the 
configuration studied here, the contribution of each segment  rdr  in each micro-ring is 

different because the center of rotation does not necessarily coincide with the center of 

any of the micro-rings. Therefore, in order to construct the transfer matrix of each section 

we have to evaluate the phase accumulated by a wave propagating along a curved 

waveguide segment which is rotating around an arbitrary point. 

Figure 2 illustrate the geometry of this problem: a wave propagating in micro-ring 

resonator with radius R while the center of this ring is rotating with angular velocity Ω 

around a fixed point. The distance between the center of the micro-ring and the center of

Eq. (3) exhibits several interesting properties that should be noted. First, the rotation-

related phase shift is independent of the waveguide index of refraction n. This is a well-

known property of the Sagnac effect which does not depend on the refractive index of the 

medium comprising the loop. Second, for a complete loop the second term in (3) vanishes 

and thus the phase shift is independent of the center of the rotation. However, in the 

structure analyzed here, the propagation section between two couplers does not form a 

complete loop, and therefore, the second term must be included. 

For simplicity, we assume that the micro-rings are identical and lossless and that the 

coupling coefficients κ between adjacent micro-rings are also identical. The transfer 

matrices for the three types of section are straightforwardly given by:

where MI, MO, and MR are respectively the transfer matrices for the input section, the 

output section and the recurring section, D=1 for the signal propagating with the device 

rotation and –1 for the signal counter propagating to the device rotation. α is the angle 

between adjacent micro-rings (see Fig. 1). The overall transfer matrix connecting 

between the inputs and outputs of the CROW is, therefore, given by:

configuration illustrated in Fig. 1.  

Equations (5), (4) and (1) allow us to calculate the output signal Br for various 

parameters. A closer inspection of (4) allows us to eliminate some of the terms because 

we are not interested in the complete transmission function of the CROW but rather in 

the phase difference between the two paths. The phase terms proportional to 

~
R  can be 
0

rewritten as unit matrices multiplied by a common phase factor. Since this phase factor is 

identical for both paths, it has no effect on the outcome of (1), and therefore, the output 

signal Br is independent of 

~
R . This is an important conclusion because 
0

~
R  defines the 
0

area of the effective CROW ring. The Sagnac effect in conventional waveguide loops is 

directly related to the area of the loop, thus we cannot analyze this effect in the CROW 

loop simply by assuming an effective ring waveguide with the dispersion relation of a 

CROW. 

Fig. 3a depicts the output intensity |Br |2 as a function of Ω for CROWs with different 

number of resonators. The parameters of these CROWs are defined in the figure caption. 

As can be expected, the output intensity increases for larger Ω with steeper slope 

(responsivity) for larger number of micro-rings. For rotation-sensing application, a 

steeper slope is advantageous because it corresponds to higher sensitivity, i.e., ability to 

detect slower rotation rates. Figures 3b-3d show the relative responsivity of the CROW 

loop for varying number of rings (3b), coupling coefficient (3c) and the micro-rings 

radius (3d). The responsivity increases for larger number of micro-rings N, smaller 

coupling coefficient κ, and larger micro-rings radius R.  

It is worthy to quantify some of these trends because they reveal the inherent differences 

between the Sagnac effect in CROWs and in conventional waveguides. Figure 3b shows 

a quadratic fit to the dependence of the responsivity on the number of rings comprising 

the CROW. The fit indicates that the responsivity of a closed-loop CROW, SN, consisting 
of N micro-rings is related to that of a single ring according to SN = (N+1)2/4·S1. It is well 

known that the slope of the output signal of a single-ring device is proportional to the 

square of the ring area [12], and therefore, the responsivity of the CROW-based device is 

proportional to the square of the total area of the micro-rings composing it. It should be 

emphasized that, unlike the conventional Sagnac effect, the overall area circumscribed by 

the coupled-resonator waveguide does not affect the output signal. This result, which 

clearly demonstrates the difference between the Sagnac effect in conventional and in 

CROWs, is interesting and, to some extent, counter-intuitive because one might expect 

the Sagnac effect contributions from adjacent micro-rings to cancel each other. Figure 3c 

also compares between the numerically calculated responsivity according to (5) and an 

analytic expression derived according to the responsivity of a single micro-ring and the 

quadratic dependence of the responsivity on the number of micro-rings in the CROW. 

For practical applications, the CROW-based gyroscope exhibits several inherent 

advantages compared to conventional Sagnac loops: 1) The dependence of the gyro 

output signal on the inter-ring coupling allows to improve the device sensitivity without 
~
R  
0

requiring larger area; 2) The independence of the responsivity of the CROW-gyro on 

indicates that the arrangement of micro-rings comprising the CROW is insignificant, and 

thus, enabling a more efficient utilization of the chip area. 

The limiting factor of the ability of a rotation sensor to detect low angular velocity is the 
output power |Br|2 compared to the Shot noise. While ideal micro-ring resonators are 

lossless, when light propagates in real resonators it experiences propagation loss that can 

be introduced into our analysis by introducing an imaginary part to the index of refraction 

in (4). The propagation loss decreases the output signal and reduces the attainable 

sensitivity of the rotation sensor. Figure 4 shows the responsivity of a CROW rotation 

sensor as a function of the resonators’ Quality-factor (Q). As shown in the figure, for 
resonators with Q>107, the influence of the propagation loss is negligible and has small 
effect on the device response. Since high-Q (>107) single-mode, planar-technology-based 

micro-ring resonators are being fabricated by many research groups [13], the propagation 

losses in the cavities do not limit significantly the sensitivity of the CROW rotation 

sensor.

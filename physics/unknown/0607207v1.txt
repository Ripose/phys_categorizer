Abstract 

In the standard minority game, every agent switches to his best strategy in hand 

at each time step. If only a small number of agents are allowed to switch their 

strategies at each time step, the population variance of the system plunges. The 

variance reaches a low value and remains steady for a period of time. Then without 

any sign it starts to rise abruptly to a high value and then decreases smoothly to the 

previous low value again. The process of an abrupt rise followed by a gentle decrease 

repeats again and again but without obvious characteristic length as time goes on. The 

phenomenon is similar to the collapse of a sand pile with sands being added 

continuously from the top. We define the scale of collapse of the population variance 

by the difference of the variance before and after an abrupt rise. We then find that the 

logarithmic plot of the frequency versus scale of the collapses follows a power law.

Introduction: the concept of self-organized criticality 

I. 

 

Suppose the grains of sands are dropped from above the center of a sand pile. 

The pile will be build up gradually with a conical surface. When the slope of the 

surface reaches a certain maximal slope, adding sands further will induce avalanches 

of various sizes. Bak et al[1] simulated the process of the formation of a sand pile and 

found that the distribution of the size of avalanches shows a power law. The sand pile 

will repeatedly self-organize itself to the critical state with maximal slope and then 

collapse in various scales. Many other systems such as earthquakes[2], granular 

stick-slip system[3], traffic jam[4] were also shown to have self-organization behavior. 

Even evolution of life or economic growth is suspected to be a self-organized critical 

system[5].   

The distinct features of the self-organized critical systems are the existence of 

a critical state to which the system will self-organize itself, and a power law 

distribution of certain physical quantity. In this article, we present our finding that the 

minority game (MG)[6] will behave as a self-organized critical system if the 

constraint of limiting number of agents in changing strategy is imposed. In particular, 

we show that the constrained MG self-organizes itself to a critical state, and the 

critical state collapses irregularly in various scales. The distribution of the collapse 

scale shows a power-law relation. 

In Sec. II we introduce the standard MG and describe some of its properties 

that lead to our discovery of its self-organization behavior described in Sec. III. In Sec. 

IV we make a link between the constrained MG and a sand pile model to show they 

behave similarly so that the self-organized criticality appears in one system if it does 

in the other. Sec. V is the conclusion. 

II. 

The standard Minority Game 

 

             

The MG was recently introduced to simulate the adaptive evolution of a 

population of agents. The game is played by N agents in choosing one of two 

decisions. Those who are in the minority are rewarded one point. When the game is 

played repeatedly, agents use strategies in order to gain more points. The standard MG 

defines a strategy as a list of 

M2   entries, each prescribes in what decision to make 

according to the winning history of last M time steps. The winning history is updated 

according to current outcome on every time step. A basic property of the game is the 

variation of population in the minority group as time goes on. The standard deviation 

σ  to the mean value N/2 is a convenient measure of how effective the system is at 

distributing resources. The smaller  σ  is, the larger the global gain is. A remarkable 

result[7] was found that variance per agent, 

N/2σ

, is a function of 

NM /2=ρ

. 

Suppose N agents are assigned S strategies each arbitrarily in the beginning of 

the game. Each agent i uses one of his strategies 

is   to play the game at each time 

step. There exists a best set { is , i =1,2, …, N} such that average of the variance over 

all possible histories (i.e., all entries of the strategies) is minimal. We determine this 

minimal value 

minσ   by picking a best strategy (which makes average variance 

2

smallest) for every agent once at a time and stop the process when a stable minimum 

is found. The results of 

minσ   are plotted as a function of  ρ  in Fig. 1.   

2

In real game, each agent has neither enough information nor intention to choose 

a strategy that makes average variance minimal. Instead, he will choose the strategy 

which seems the best to him. A possible way which allows each agent to judge which 

strategy is best to him is that each agent assigns a virtual point to every strategy he has 

which makes correct prediction. The best strategy to an agent is then simply the one 

with highest virtual score. Now each agent chooses his highest score strategy each 

time to play the game, what can one expect for average variance? Savit et al[7] found 

out that average variance is slightly better (i.e. smaller) than that of not using strategy 

at all when  ρ  is large, but is much worse (i.e. larger) when  ρ  is small(Fig. 1). This 

comes as something of a surprise. Presumably, when each agent uses his highest score 

strategy, he will win the game more often than not using strategy. If all agents gain 

more, the global gain increases, so average variance should decrease. The 

presumption that one switches to a higher score strategy will win the game more often 

in the subsequent time steps actually fails because other agents might switch strategies 

in the same time. In simulation we found that many agents switch strategies 

simultaneously when  ρ  is small[8], so they are likely to form majority and therefore 

lose the game. 

To test the effect of the number of agents who switch strategies, we play the 

game by limiting one agent to switch strategy at each time step and calculate average 

variance per agent. We indeed see average variance decreases to a low value close to 

its minimum 

2

minσ   for any  ρ(Fig. 1). 

 

 

III.  The state with minimal variance is critical 

Playing the MG by allowing only one agent to switch strategy at a time, 

average variance will gradually reach a low value close to 

2

minσ . Keep playing the 

game in the same way, average variance stays near the minimal value with small 

fluctuation for some time. But then it rises sharply now and then with no characteristic 

size[Fig. 2]. The long term variation of average variance behaves very like the 

avalanches of a sand pile. The minimal variance state is the critical state which the 

system will self-organize itself to approach. But it is unstable. A small random 

perturbation caused by an agent’s move of changing his strategy might lead other 

agents to change strategies in the direction to the verge of collapse, which is, in 

current case, a large amount of increase in variance. After a sudden collapse of certain 

size, the system approaches gradually the critical state again. The process repeats 

again and again. We define the size of collapse by the difference of the variance right 

before an abrupt rise and the peak value of the rise. A logarithmic plot of the 

frequency of occurrence versus size of the collapses for the case of 

6=M

  is given 

in Fig. 3(a). We see that the plot obeys a power law up to a certain size of 

collapse:

)(
xf

α−∝ x

, 

1≈α   with an exponential cutoff. When the size of the system, 

that is N in the game, is larger, the power law is valid for a larger range. This is 

consistent with experimental data for the avalanches of a pile of rice[9], and also with 

the analysis of avalanches models[10]. The value of  α  is function of M only, 

independent of the size of the system (N). A similar plot for the case M = 5 is given in 

Fig. 3(b). Its  α  value is about 3.5.   

               

 

IV. 

Similarity between the sand pile and the constrained minority game 

The power-law behavior of the constrained minority game which allows only 

one agent to change strategy at a time comes naturally when we make a similarity 

connection between the game and a sand pile model. Consider a sand pile built up by 

adding a grain of sand particle per unit time from the top. The newly added grain of 

sand rolls down the hill of the sand pile seeking a stable place to stay. This process is 

similar to the constrained MG in searching an agent to change strategy. Once the sand 

particle stops at some point, it changes the stability condition of at least its 

neighborhood. Similarly in the MG, when an agent changes his strategy, his 

predictions at some other histories change accordingly so that it will affect the 

searching results at subsequent time steps. Consider the sand pile is confined in a 

cylindrical container, the radius of lower surface defines the size of the sand pile 

inside. A grain of sand which falls from the top goes in random directions to the 

bottom. The size and direction play the similar roles of N and M respectively in the 

MG. 

Keeping adding sand particles, the sand pile will reach a state with a maximal 

slope. Adding sands further will the induce avalanches of all sizes. In MG, changing 

strategy one at a time, the system will reach a state with minimal variance in 

population. Further changes of strategy will induce sudden increases in variance of 

various sizes. Both systems have a power-law behavior. 

To strengthen the similarity between the sand pile system and the constrained 

MG, let us consider the effect of the searching process in both cases on the critical 

value. In the case of sand pile confined in the container, we drop sands randomly from 

the top within central area of radius r. We would expect the critical value, which is the 

maximal slope of the surface in this case, will be a monotonic decreasing function of r, 

since the slope has to be zero when r is equal to the radius of the cylinder. Our 

simulation using a sand-pile model similar to the one used by Bak et al[1] confirms 

this expectation(Fig. 4(a)). For the MG case, we first order all the agents. At each time 

step, we begin randomly at the rth agent, 

Nr ≤

, and search downward for one agent 

to change strategy. The variance will approach a critical value which is a minimum 

repeatedly. The minimal variance per agent is found to be monotonic increasing 

function of r(Fig. 4(b)). This is consistent with the picture that the state with the 

minimal variance in the MG is corresponding to the state with the maximal slope in 

the sand pile. 

We are currently investigating the dependence of the probability density on the 

parameters N, M, and its possible relation to real data of earthquakes, avalanches of 

sand piles[9], rice piles[10], and granular stick-slip experiment[3]. 

V. 

Conclusion 

 

The minority game was originally invented to simulate the variation of a 

system in which individual competes with one another and adapts to the global change. 

In the standard game, all agents change his strategy to the best one in hand at each 

time. We add a constraint by allowing only one agent to change strategy each time and 

find that the constrained minority game behaves like a self-organized critical system. 

In particular, we see that the variance of the number of the winning agents is attracted 

to a minimal value, and it arises intermittently to some large values. A power law is 

observed in the distribution of the variance. A comparison of the constrained minority 

game with the building process of a sand pile, which is generally accepted to be a 

typical self-organized system, shows that they both behave qualitatively the same. 

There are only three free parameters (N, M, and S) in the constrained minority game, 

and its statistical behavior can be understood based on the probability theory. Thus it 

seems possible to develop a calculable model of the self-organized critical systems 

 

 

using the constrained minority game.

Measuring Bullet Velocity with a PC Soundcard
Michael Courtney and Brian Edwards

Abstract:
This article describes a simple method for using a PC soundcard to accurately measure bullet 
velocity.  The method involves placing the microphone within a foot of the muzzle and firing at a 
steel target between 50 and 100 yards away.  The time of flight for the bullet is simply the 
recorded time between muzzle blast and sound of the bullet hitting the target minus the time it 
takes the sound to return from the target to the microphone.  The average bullet velocity is simply 
the distance from the muzzle to the target divided by the time of flight of the bullet.  This method 
can also be applied to measurement of paintball velocities.

Introduction
Physics has a long and important relationship with the measurement of bullet velocity.  
The earliest accurate measurements of bullet velocity relied on the ballistic pendulum.  
The ballistic pendulum remains an important laboratory tool for demonstrating 
conservation of momentum and energy, as well as providing a method for measuring the 
velocity generated by potato cannons.1

As firearms design matured, higher velocities made capture of a bullet in a pendulum 
more difficult.  Longer range applications from higher velocity and increased accuracy 
also mandated more accurate velocity measurements in order to accurately predict long 
range trajectories.  This led to the development of the optical chronograph (commonly 
known simply as the chronograph in modern ballistics) which measures bullet velocity by 
optically detecting the bullet passing over fixed points and using the time interval to 
compute the velocity.

As paintball has become increasingly popular, most paintball facilities require that 
paintball markers (the devices which shoot paintballs are called “markers” rather than 
“guns”) be adjusted to keep the projectile velocity under 250 feet per second.   This 
ensures the safety of participants, since injury becomes more likely as velocities exceed 
250 feet per second.  Optical chronographs have long been used in this application, but 
recently less expensive paintball chronographs have become available that employ the 
Doppler effect.

Measuring the velocity of a bullet or paintball with an optical chronograph is a relatively 
simple process and the price of these instruments has become more affordable in the last 
several years.  However, shooters who use their chronographs regularly and under a 
variety of conditions have probably noticed some drawbacks.  This technique requires 
putting the instrument in front of the gun and shooting through skyscreens, which contain 
a photodiode, a lens, and light diffuser.  Some models require the electronics to also be 
placed in front of the gun.  

Consequently, replacing skyscreens and electronics can become a recurring operational 
expense, especially if one’s aim is poor or if one regularly chronographs shotgun loads or 
saboted muzzleloader projectiles.  Shotgun wads and plastic sabots can quickly separate 

1

from the projectile(s) and damage the equipment.  An important rule of firearms safety is 
never allow the muzzle to point at anything you are not willing to destroy.  Many 
chronographs end up vivid demonstrations of this important safety rule.

Optical chronographs can also be inconsistent in some lighting conditions such as late 
afternoon, early morning, or the covered shooting area of a range.  Cables and sky 
screens can be an irritation to set-up.  Fiddling around with a chronograph in front of the 
firing line is an unwelcome activity at many range facilities.

This article describes a simple method for using a PC soundcard to accurately measure 
bullet or paintball velocity.  Soundcards are inexpensive and readily available, and the 
most computers today include a soundcard.  The biggest advantage of the method is that 
no expensive equipment needs to be placed in front of the gun.  Non-marking (paintless) 
projectiles are available to measure the muzzle velocity of paintball markers with less 
mess.  

The Soundcard Method
The soundcard method involves placing the microphone within a foot of the muzzle, 
preferably a bit to the side and slightly behind the muzzle.  A steel target that makes a 
loud noise when hit is placed at a carefully measured distance between 50 and 100 yards 
away.  Targets that make a resonating sound like a gong work better than targets which 
make more “clink” type of sounds.  For paintball markers, much shorter distances (15-30 
feet) should be used.

The soundcard should be operated with software (such as Audacity2) that allows the user 
to view the sound waveform and accurately determine the time difference between the 
beginning of the muzzle blast and the beginning of the sound of the bullet hitting the steel 
target.  One can also use a Vernier LabPro with a microphone.  Under some conditions, 
especially if the range is covered and the target is close, reverberation of the muzzle blast 
will be loud enough to mask the sound of the bullet hitting the target.  If this occurs, the 
easiest solution is increasing the distance to the target to give the muzzle blast more time 
to dissipate before the sound of the bullet hitting the target arrives back at the 
microphone.  

The time of flight of the bullet (tbullet) is determined by subtracting the time it takes sound 
to travel from the target back to the microphone (tsound) from the time recorded between 
the muzzle blast and the sound of the bullet hitting the target (ttotal).  Expressed as a 
formula, 

tbullet = ttotal – tsound.

tsound = d / Vsound.

The time it takes the sound to travel back from the steel target to the microphone is 
simply the distance (d) divided by the velocity of sound (Vsound),

The velocity of sound is roughly 1100 feet per second (ft/s), but it varies with temperature 
as shown in Table 1.  In addition to having an accurate distance measurement (tape 
measure rather than range finder), one needs the ambient temperature within 2 degrees to 
have an accurate Vsound.

Once the time of flight of the bullet is determined, the average velocity of the bullet is 
Vbullet = d / tbullet.

Results and Analysis
The first load tested is a mild .223 Remington load.  The resulting sound waveform is 
shown in Figure 1.  Our software is set to begin recording the waveform when a loud 
noise is detected, so the beginning of the muzzle blast is at t = 0.  As shown in Figure 1,

the sound level saturates the equipment for the first 0.04 seconds, and there are some 
prominent peaks intermittently through the signal that correspond to echoes.  There is a 
large peak at t = 0.1883s that records the bullet hitting the steel target.

We shot a metal target located 150 feet away.  The speed of sound at 82° F is 1139.6 
ft/sec.  Consequently, the time for the sound to return from the target to the microphone is 
tsound = 150 ft/ (1139.6 ft/s) = 0.1316 s.  

Analysis of the sound waveform shown in Figure 1 (zooming in is required) shows the 
time between the muzzle blast and sound of the bullet hitting the target is ttotal = 0.1875 s.  
Subtracting the time it takes the sound to return from the target to the microphone gives

tbullet = ttotal – tsound  = 0.1875 s – 0.1316 s = 0.0559 s.

The average velocity of the bullet over the distance of 50 yards is then

Vbullet = d / tbullet = 150 ft/ (0.0559 s) = 2684 ft/s.

For comparison, the velocity measured on an Oehler Model 35 optical chronograph 
placed 6 feet in front of the muzzle is 2763 ft/s.  At first glance, these measurements do 
not seem to agree, but it is important to note that our acoustic method measures the 
average velocity between the bullet and the target. This average velocity is slightly 
slower than the muzzle velocity because the bullet slows down in flight as a result of air 
resistance.

There are a number of public access ballistics programs that one can use for computing 
time of flight and trajectory for a given muzzle velocity and ballistic coefficient.  The 
ballistic coefficient is the specification describing how air resistance slows down a bullet 
in flight.  The ballistic coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that roughly corresponds to 
the fraction of 1000 yards that a bullet must travel to lose 50% of its initial kinetic energy 
(or 29.3% of its initial velocity).  For example, a bullet with a ballistic coefficient of 0.4 
has lost 50% of its kinetic energy at a range of 400 yards.  Performing a Google search 
for “ballistic calculator” will provide several options.  We have found the JBM ballistic 
calculator reliable and easy to use.3

Using the manufacturer’s published ballistic coefficient of 0.200 for the .223 bullet, the 
JBM ballistics calculator predicts a time of flight of 0.056 s for 50 yards, thus an average 
velocity 2679 ft/s for a 50 yard flight.  Consequently, our acoustic measurement of bullet 
velocity is in excellent agreement with the optical chronograph, with a relative error of 
0.2%.

Looking again at Figure 1, one might be tempted to misinterpret one of the earlier echo 
peaks as corresponding to the sound of the bullet hitting the plate, but more careful 
analysis rules out this possibility.  For example, consider the peak labeled “A” with a 
magnitude close to 3.7 located at a time of 0.1400 s.  Since sound takes 0.1316 s to return 
from the target, this peak would correspond to a bullet time of flight of 0.0084 s 
suggesting an impossible velocity over 17,000 ft/s.

We also tested the acoustic method of measuring bullet velocity using a 38 grain hollow 
point load in the 22 Long Rifle cartridge (22LR).  A sound waveform is shown in Figure 
2.  The sound level saturates the equipment for the first 0.025 seconds, and there are 
some prominent peaks between 0.06 s and 0.12 s corresponding to echoes.  As explained 
above, it is not possible to interpret these early peaks as the sound of the bullet hitting the 
target because it takes sound over 0.13 s to return from the target.  

There is a large peak with a magnitude of 3.5 at t = 0.2594 s.  This is the peak that 
records the bullet hitting the steel target.  

The speed of sound at 76° F is 1133.2 ft/s.  The time for the sound to return from the 
target to the microphone is tsound = 150 ft/ (1113.2 ft/s) = 0.1324 s.  

The total time between the muzzle blast and sound of the bullet hitting the target is ttotal = 
0.2594 s.  Subtracting the time it takes the sound to return from the target to the 
microphone gives

tbullet = ttotal – tsound  = 0.2594s – 0.1324s = 0.1270s.

The average velocity of the bullet over the distance of 50 yards is then

Vbullet = d / tbullet  = 150 ft/ (0.1270s) = 1181 ft/s.

The optical chronograph velocity for this shot is 1270 ft/s.  As expected, the average 
velocity from the acoustic method is slightly slower than the chronographed muzzle 
velocity because the bullet slows down in flight. Using a ballistic coefficient of 0.124, we 
compute the time of flight for the measured chronograph velocity to predict a time of 
flight of 0.126 s for 50 yards, thus an average velocity 1190 ft/s.  The acoustic 
measurement of bullet velocity is in excellent agreement with a chronograph with a 
relative error of 0.8%.

Since this technique is partly motivated by the propensity for muzzleloaders to be tough 
on chronographs (sabots and corrosive residue), we also tested the acoustic method on a  
muzzleloader.  Our test load was 40 grains of Hodgdon Triple Seven powder in a 45 
caliber muzzleloader behind a saboted .357 caliber 180 grain bullet.  

Our test load is relatively quiet.  Many muzzleloader loads have a muzzle blast of 
significantly longer duration that requires placing the target at 100 yards to prevent the 
muzzle blast from obscuring the sound of the bullet hitting the target in the sound 
waveform.  We were able to test this milder load at 50 yards.

As shown in Figure 3, the sound level saturates the equipment for the first 0.05 seconds, 
and there are some prominent peaks in the 0.06 to 0.17 second range that correspond to 

6

echoes.  We cannot interpret these peaks as the sound of the bullet hitting the target 
because they occur either before sound could even travel 50 yards, or they correspond to 
velocities over 3000 ft/s.  The large peak with magnitude of 3.8 at t = 0.2487 s
corresponds to the bullet hitting the steel target.

time [seconds]

From Table 1, the speed of sound under the ambient conditions of 78° F is 1135.4 ft/s.  
The time for the sound to return from the target to the microphone is tsound = 150 ft/ 
(1135.4 ft/s) = 0.1321 s.  

The total time between the muzzle blast and sound of the bullet hitting the target is ttotal = 
0.2487 s.  Subtracting the time it takes the sound to return from the target to the 
microphone gives

tbullet = ttotal – tsound  = 0.2487 s – 0.1321 s = 0.1166 s.

The average velocity of the bullet over the distance of 50 yards is then

Vbullet = d / tbullet  = 150 ft/ (0.1166 s) = 1286 ft/s.

For comparison, the velocity measured on the optical chronograph is 1328 ft/s.  Once 
again, this average velocity is slightly slower than the muzzle velocity because the bullet 
slows down in flight as a result of air resistance.  In this case, detailed comparison with 
the chronograph is not possible because the ballistic coefficient of the projectile changes 
mid-flight when the plastic sabot separates from the bullet.

Discussion and Conclusions
One might consider using this acoustic time of flight measurement technique along with 
an optical chronograph to measure an unknown ballistic coefficient.  Many ballistic 
software programs will compute the ballistic coefficient given the muzzle velocity from a 
chronograph and time of flight from the soundcard.  If the software program lacks this 
feature, one might guess different ballistic coefficients until the software gives the 
measured time of flight.  We should caution those considering this approach that very 
small errors in the time of flight determination yield relatively large errors in the 
determination of ballistic coefficients.  

Even though the acoustic technique described above can measure the time of flight and 
bullet velocity reliably with an accuracy better than 1%, attempts to determine an 
unknown ballistic coefficient by this method can be off by as much as 10-20% due to 
uncertainties introduced by errors in the distance measurement and speed of sound 
determination.  

Accurately determining the time of flight well enough to reasonably estimate the ballistic 
coefficient requires both measuring the distance to the target within a couple of inches 
and placing a second microphone within two inches of the target and recording the time 
difference between the muzzle blast on the near microphone and the sound of impact on 
the far microphone.  The safest place for the far microphone is behind an impenetrable 
steel target.

We believe that the soundcard method of measuring bullet velocity has potential 
commercial software application in a program that uses a soundcard and automates the 
processes described above.  However, reliable commercial application will require 
discerning the sound of the bullet hitting the target even in cases where the muzzle blast 
and other sounds prevent the clear discrimination of a peak when the bullet hits the target.  
This can be accomplished with standard techniques of Fourier analysis where the 
program learns the unique spectral signature of the target and detects the time at which 
this spectral signature occurs in the sound waveform.  The Audacity software program 
has a sound spectrogram feature that facilitates this and can be used to demonstrate the 
benefits of a resonant target.

In conclusion, we have presented a useful method for measuring bullet velocity with a PC 
soundcard or Vernier LabPro.  This method provides reasonable accuracy (1%) but 
requires some care.  Admittedly our method of measuring bullet velocity with a 
soundcard has some drawbacks.  Loud noise can interfere with the measurement.  The 
technique requires some computations, but these are relatively simple and are not hard to 
set up in a spreadsheet program.  On the positive side, the PC soundcard method of 
measuring bullet velocity is a great example of Physics and technology working together 
to accomplish a technically challenging goal without putting specialized equipment in 
front of the barrel of a gun.

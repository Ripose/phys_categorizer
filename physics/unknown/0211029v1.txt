We analyze a monetary system of random money transfer on the basis of double entry bookkeeping.

Without boundary conditions, we do not reach a price equilibrium and violate text-book formulas of

economist’s  quantity  theory  (MV=PQ).  To  match  the  resulting  quantity  of  money  with  the  model

assumption of a constant price, we have to impose boundary conditions. They either restrict specific

transfers globally or impose transfers locally. Both connect through a general framework of transfer

potentials. We show that either restricted or imposed transfers can shape gaussian, tent-shape expo-

nential,  boltzmann-exponential,  pareto  or  periodic  equilibrium  distributions.  We  derive  the  master

equation and find its general time dependent approximate solution. An equivalent of quantity theory

for random money transfer under the boundary conditions of transfer potentials is given.

Recently, economic models of money transfer were connected to statistical mechanics [1]-[7]. Under

the boundary condition of a constant number of assets, the description of wealth was related to the

statistical mechanics of physics such as Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions [1][2][4] or distributions with

pareto  tails  [2]-[4].  Evidence  for  this  approach  has  been  found  in  income  data  [5][6].  We  further

explore this statistical approach [7] to the monetary part of the economy. In contrast to previous work,

we base our analysis on the more general laws of double entry bookkeeping [8]-[12]. Assets are now

balanced by liabilities and the distribution of monetary wealth has an asset and a liability side. Under

a  most  simple  model  of  random  money transfer, we  confirm  the  Boltzmann-Gibbs  distribution  [1]

when the  liability per  agent  is  limited.  However,  when  we use  other boundary conditions, we  find

gaussian,  tent-shape  exponential  or  pareto  distributions  although  the  mode  of  transfer  has  not

changed. 

Interestingly, random money transfer without boundary conditions contradicts economist’s quantity

theory. Quantity theory was the basis for monetary policies for a long time and relates the quantity of

money M and the money velocity V with the price level P [9][10][18]. In quantity theory, when quan-

tity M or velocity V rises, the price level P rises accordingly (see eq.(5)). Yet random money transfer

shows a different behavior: the quantity M increases without bounds although the price level and all

other parameters of quantity theory are held fix. We therefore argue that the choice of boundary con-

dition is a major factor in determining the final distribution. Probably for many monetary systems, the

dynamics of the agents only play a minor role. This would justify the approach to use random transfer

schemes to model the monetary part of the economy.

We develop a potential-based approach which allows to model the boundary conditions of limited or

imposed transfers. The boundary conditions are thus given by the potential. We find the master equa-

tion and are able to give an analytical time dependent approximation which converges for large times

to the correct distribution. From this solution, we find that the transfer potential directly determines

the final distribution. The wealth distributions can be shaped at will with a suitable transfer potential.

This potential approach to random money transfer is very similar in structure to the quantum mechan-

ics of the Schrödinger equation.

1. Double entry bookkeeping of money transfer

In  double  entry  bookkeeping,  transfer  of  money  is  intrinsically  linked  to  the  creation  of  debt

[11][14][15][16]. A monetary transfer from agent A to agent C triggers one of four different cases

2

registered with four different bookkeeping records. The four cases are chosen based on the initial con-

ditions of asset and liability of A and C (Fig. 1a):

1. Transfer by creation if A has liabilities and C has assets. A will increase its liabilities

and C will increase its assets.

2. Transfer of asset if both A and C have assets. A will decrease and C will increase their

assets.

their liabilities.

3. Transfer of liability if both A and C have liabilities. A will increase and C will decrease

4. Transfer by annihilation is applied if A has assets and C has liabilities. A will decreases

its assets and C decreases its liabilities.

These four cases mean that the monetary transfer in double entry bookkeeping is directly linked to

creation  and  reduction  of  the  quantity  of  money.  Instead  of  counting  assets  ai  and  liabilities  li  of
agent i, we can implement all four cases numerically by using a single wealth variable

In a transfer, we decrease the wealth pA of A and increase the wealth pC of C. The same four cases
still apply in the money transfer, but they are now hidden behind the sign arithmetic of summation

pi = ai - li

(1)

and subtraction of pi.

We have translated the bookkeeping records to Feynman-graphs (Fig. 1a) using a recently established

connection from bookkeeping to the bouncing of particles called bookkeeping mechanics [14]-[16].

In  this  mechanical  picture,  the  statistical  mechanics  of  monetary  transfer  becomes  the  statistical

mechanics of a gas. Differing from an ideal gas, the monetary gas does not implement conservation of

energy. Some transfer collisions will lead to particle creation or annihilation.

The quantity of money in bookkeeping can be generalized from economics by counting the absolute

value 

 of the number of currency units pic of agent i and currency c. This definition super-
sedes the economical definition which counts only certain bank deposits. We can infer the change in
M  induced  by  a  transfer.  We  have  to  split  the  transferred  currency  units  ∆pic  into  a  change  from

The novelty in both quantity definitions Mic and Eic is that we can identify the agent i who changed
the quantity of currency c. Quantity becomes a microscopic variable. In the random model discus-

sions below, we will calculate M and E from the distribution of monetary wealth n(p,t):

By doing so, we exclude the assets and liabilities of the bank and count only their mirrored part in the

bookkeepings of the agents. The bank is not considered to be counted as an agent in the following

models.

2. Economy of random money transfer: Contradiction to quantity theory

The random transfer of the model is simple: Each of the N agents indexed by i have no initial cur-

rency units: pi(t=0)=0. They choose transfer partners randomly at each time step t, yielding N transfer
pairs. Each pair transfers ∆p currency units. Such a simplified model is motivated from the finding

that details of the monetary exchange models do not appear to be essential [1]. By choosing a random

transfer scheme, we implement the most simple money transfer economy which does not follow the

dogma of money moving in circles. For example random money transfer implements N farmers with-
out surplus, but a fluctuating harvest of p0-∆p, p0 or p0+∆p given in monetary units. Each year, they
balance their luck by exchanging harvest against money. 

Random money transfer leads to an expansive diffusion process with a diffusion constant given by 

D=(∆p)2/∆t

As expected, the distribution of monetary units n(p,t) is gaussian and the total quantity of money M

follows a square root time evolution:

The analytical results have been checked against a numerical simulation [17]. We show distributions
for N=2000 for ∆p=1 at t=100∆t, 200∆t and 300∆t together with the time evolution of the quantity of

money per agent M/N in Fig. 1b.

We count the frequency of the applied bookkeeping records. We find only creations or annihilations

for N=2, transfers of assets and liabilities appear only for N>2. Creations occur more often than anni-

hilations, accounting for the same increase in M, independent of N. This is due to the asymmetry of

the initial conditions. For a transfer between two agents with p=0 each, only a creation and no annihi-

lation can be performed.

This basic model of random money transfer contradicts text-book versions of quantity theory. With M

the money ’supply’, V the money velocity, P the price ’level’ and Q the ’real’ gross national product

(GNP), quantity theory [9][10][18] states

MV = PQ
(7)
The random money transfer yields a fixed V=∆p/∆t, a fixed price level P=∆p and a fixed GNP given
by the number of agents N multiplied by the exchanged prices over the time span Q=N∆p/∆t. We thus
expect a constant M=N∆p. Yet, we find an increase of M without bounds. Quantity theory is therefore

not  applicable  to  random  money  transfer  which  creates  of  asset-liability  pairs  from  loans.  Such

important restrictions were known to the inventors of quantity theory, but subsequently dropped (see

discussion in [18], p. 40ff).

In the case when agents transfer through a bank B, the bookkeeping splits into two independent cur-

rencies. One is used for the assets of the agents (black deposit currency) and the other for the liabili-

ties (white loan currency) of the agents as shown in the bookkeeping records (Fig. 1c) and discussed

thoroughly  elsewhere  [16].  In  such  a  bicurrency  system,  a  transfer  between  agents  involves  two

prices: a deposit price if paid by deposits and a loan price if paid from a loan. As an example, we

Fig. 1: Bookkeeping of money transfer and random money transfer. (a) Money transfer from agents A to C without a
bank yields four possibilities depending on the initial stock of asset and liability of A and C. (b) Random money transfer
results in an expanding gaussian distribution of monetary wealth. The quantity of money increases without bounds. (c)
The four cases of money transfer from agents A to C through a bank B establishes a bicurrency system of deposit cur-
rency and loan currency [16]. (d) For an exchange rate of 1:2 between deposit currency and loan currency, we find a
step in the distribution. The quantity of both currencies differ by a factor of 2.

5

choose  a  transfer  of  ∆pD=1  deposit  currency  units  and  ∆pL=2  loan  currency  units,  establishing  an
exchange rate of 1:2. In this case, the liability side of distribution expands faster with twice the quan-

tity of money (Fig. 1d). Note that the discontinuity at p=0 in the distribution is no artefact, since we

apply the four bank bookkeeping records of the bicurrency system (Fig. 1c). It means we cannot use

anymore  the  compactification  of  (eq. 1),  but  have  to  account  assets  and  liabilities  independently.

Although it would be instructive (and easily possible) to use a bicurrency system in the following, we

will restrict ourselves again to one currency which describes the bank bookkeeping practice of today

[16].

3. Forbidden transfers equilibrate the random economy globally

We have seen so far, that a small economy with no surplus, but with a random choice of transfer part-

ners  will  increase  the  quantity  of  money  without  bounds.  In  the  following  we  will  discuss,  how

boundary conditions can equilibrate the system. In most cases, a  constant quantity level M will be

reached. We will try to match the results with quantity theory

We can impose an equilibrium by forbidding transfers which would increase the quadratic measure of

the quantity of money E over a target E0. This is a global, non-local approach. Before each transfer, it
has to be tested whether the total E will be increased over the limit E0. Which such a transfer restric-
tion,  the  distribution  converges  to  a  gaussian  profile  (E0=25πΝ;  Fig. 2a:  distribution  at  t=300∆t,
Fig. 2b solid line: quantity M over time):

Another  way  to  equilibrate  the  random  monetary  system  is  to  forbid  all  transfers  which  would

increase the total quantity of money over a target quantity M0. Now the random economy converges
to a tent-shaped exponential distribution (M0=10N; Fig. 2d: distribution at t=300∆t, Fig. 2e solid line:

For the last two cases of transfer restrictions, we could find the result of quantity theory if we would

M N p∆

, meaning that the limit M or E would somehow know the

explicitly assume a scaling of 
price level ∆p of the system.

Typically in model systems, a liability limit is applied to simulations of monetary systems [1]-[7]. We

simulate also this case and forbid all transfers which would increase the liabilities of an agent above a

(8)

limit L. This loan restriction leads to an exponential Boltzmann distribution n(p) in accordance with
the results in the literature [1]-[7] (L=5e; Fig. 2g: distribution at t=300∆t, Fig. 2h solid line: quantity

M over time):

The  quantity  theory  (eq. 7)  would  be  fulfilled,  if  the  liability  limit  would  explicitly  scale  with  the
price  level  ∆p  as  L=e∆p/2,  yielding  a  quite  low  liability  limit  of  L=1.36  for  ∆p=1.  Note  that  this

boundary condition was thoroughly discussed by Dragulescu and Yakovenko [1].

We can impose a pareto distribution by defining a logarithmic money quantity 

Gic

ln=

pic

 and for-

bidding all transfers which would increase the total G above a limit G0. In this case the distribution
tries to converge to a pareto distribution (G0=0.8N; Fig. 2k: distribution at t=300∆t, Fig. 2l solid line:
quantity M over time):

n

=

k p 1 D⁄–

M ∞→

The  quantity  of  money  M  is  slowly  diverging.  Since  the  pareto  distribution  cannot  be  normalized

[20], we had to fit k=215 to match the grain and timing of our numerical implementation. Further-

more  the  simulation  assumed  G=0  for  p=0.  Still,  the  pareto  distribution  in  its  hyperbolic  form  is
found. The tails of the distribution are not fully filled by the diffusion process at t=300∆t. A change in
price level ∆p affects D and therefore the functional shape of the distribution.

We have to note that nonlinear quantity definitions such as E or G work only with properly indexed

agents i. Splitting the wealth of one agent into the wealth of subagents would change the total E0 or
G0. This problem is solvable: all bookkeeping must be directly connected to real agents.

4. Imposed transfers equilibrate the random economy locally: Transfer potentials

Until now, the boundary conditions forbid specific transfers. A second class of boundary conditions

allow all transfers, but act on the stock of assets and liabilities. This gives us a local approach. We do

not  have  to  measure  the  total  quantity  of  money  before  each  transfer.  We  will  show  how  locally

imposed transfers lead to the identical equilibrium of the global method of forbidden transfers as dis-

cussed before.

For example, we reach an equilibrium by imposing a negative interest rate r to both assets and liabili-
ties. The unit of interest is % per infinitesimal time interval δt. Within macroscopic time ∆t, the inter-

est  application  changes  the  assets  and  liabilities  by  a  factor  of 
r˜

This example gives us a working model. We might be able to reach the same distribution by forbid-

ding transfers or by imposing transfers. The imposed transfers are local and are not a function of the
price level ∆p or the transfer velocity ∆p/∆t. Nevertheless the final distribution does depend on D as

expected from a monetary system in which the wealth distribution reflects the price level. We will

show in the following that both approaches to a monetary equilibrium can be connected by reinter-

preting the quantity of money definition (M,E or G) as transfer potential U. We will be able to derive

and to approximate the general master equation of potential restricted random money transfer.

We introduce a transfer potential U(p). It models all additional imposed external transfers F given by
the transferred amount ∆p per time interval ∆t. We define F by the negative derivative of a potential

U(p) as usual in physics:

One should think of F as an interest rate progression table or a legal system to impose tax inputs and

outputs depending only on the wealth p of the agents. Typically, we would infer U(p) from integrating

the imposed transfers F(p). Adding the monetary flow 

nF p( )

 from the transfers F to Fick’s first law,

we find:

The potential U has the same units as the diffusion constant D. The approach is quite similar to the

treatment  of  thermophoresis  with  U  being  the  temperature  [19].  Within  the  logics  of  bookkeeping

mechanics [14][15][16], the units for D and U would be power and for F force. By inserting Fick’s

law as usual into the continuity equation, we derive the master equation of random money transfer

under a transfer potential:

(eq. 16) and (eq. 17).

The potential U(p) might impose an asymmetry onto the final distribution (eq. 17). The quantity of

money M could differ for the total assets MA and for the total liabilities ML. This means that an exter-
nal transfer pext was extracted (-) or injected (+) from the system between the times t1 and t2:

Logically, when

for the missing assets and liabilities. One would expect that such an additional agent is a bank or the

state. For example, we could use pext to model deficit spending. In the following however, we discuss
only potentials U which impose no total external transfer pext.

In the first part of the paper, we have shown four boundary condition scenarios which restricted ran-

dom money transfer (eq. 8)-(eq. 11). Now we achieve the same final distributions without restricting

any transfers, but by imposing additional transfers (eq. 13)-(eq. 17). The transfer potential biases the

We call the relationship (eq. 21) the quantity theory of random money transfer under boundary condi-

tions. It connects the measurement functional of monetary quantity U with the number of agents N
and the market diffusion parameter D. The units of the equation (N∆p²/∆t) are identical to the classi-

cal quantity equation (eq. 7). 

In a way, (eq. 21) resembles the equipartition theorem of statistical mechanics with U the energy and

D the temperature. With D as temperature, we can reinterpret the equilibrium distribution of (eq. 17)

as  boltzmann  distribution  of  statistical  mechanics:  the  structure  of  statistical  thermodynamics

By imposing transfers instead of forbidding transfers, no difficult measurement has to be undertaken
for of the price level ∆p, the diffusion constant D and the number of agents N. The monetary system

will converge to a distribution depending on D and N, although the regulatory transfers 
 do
not  depend  on  the  market  parameters  ∆p,  N  and  D.  This  is  true  for  the  absolute  linear  case

The second advantage of imposed transfers from a transfer potential is the local nature of the equilib-

rium regulation. Only the local rule (eq. 13) has to be implemented, the total quantities M, E or G do

not have to be measured. This is a very important practical advantage of imposed transfers.

Fig.  3:  Random  money  transfer  under  a  sinusoidal  transfer  potential.  The  general  time  dependent  approximation
[(eq. 16), solid line] describes well the histogram of random money transfer shown as dots. The imposed transfers yield
distribution maxima at the potential minima according to (eq. 17).

In the real world, the transfer potentials U(pi,i) among the agents i are defined by the bias of the sub-
jects to deviate from a random money transfer, for example induced by the input and output charac-

teristics of banks and the government. We applied here the approximation that the transfer potential

U(pi)  only  depends  on  the  wealth  p  of  the  agent  i.  Secondly  we  assume  that  the  economy  can  be
described as agents which are forced by an outside environment to do random transfers of money. On

a random money transfer assumption, we would be able to calculate from tax laws and interest rate

characteristics the final wealth distribution n(p) according to (eq. 17).

Towards the end, we want to demonstrate that the potential theory can shape all kinds of wealth distri-

butions. It should also show that the general time dependent approximation of (eq. 16) is quite pre-

cise. Assume that we impose a sinusoidal transfer potential U:

We simulate this monetary system with the usual parameters N=2000, D=1 and show the simulated
distribution together with the theoretical approximation from (eq. 16) at times t=5∆t, 25∆t, 100∆t and
300∆t in Fig. 3a,b,c,d. The imposed transfers F stamp a grating into the wealth distribution as the dif-

fusion  spreads  without  converging  to  an  equilibrium.  The  approximation  of  (eq. 16)  describes  the

simulation results over time with high precision. 

Any one familiar with solutions of the Schrödinger equation will spot similarities between potential

restricted  random  money  transfer  and  quantum  mechanics.  The  ’wave  packet’  diffuses  without  a

potential.  A  gaussian  distribution  is  found  for  a  parabolic  potential.  The  time  dependent  solution

yields an exponential prefactor. Energy is allowed to fluctuate. This is probably just a coincidence due

to the diffusive similarities of (eq. 15) and the Schrödinger equation. Also note that we are operating

here in momentum space according to the analogy of bookkeeping mechanics. Nevertheless the simi-

13

larities should be very helpful in approaching random money transfer from physics. We have chosen

variable letters from physics to enhance this transition. The physical analog is a gas [14] where parti-

cles bounce, create and annihilate under random momentum transfer and momentum conservation.

Energy  conservation  is  not  achieved  unless  a  suitable  transfer  potential  is  imposed.  The  potential

models a viscous friction by a medium to allow energy conservation.

5. Conclusions

We have discussed an economy of random monetary transfer between agents. We based our analysis

on explicit bookkeeping records of assets and liabilities, shown as Feynman-graphs using the momen-

tum analogy of bookkeeping mechanics. Interestingly, we cannot reach a price equilibrium without

restrictive  boundary  conditions.  The  boundary  conditions  either  forbid  certain  transfers  or  impose

transfers. We can switch between both pictures analytically by identifying the monetary quantity def-

inition as transfer potential. We find a variety of distributions by using different potentials. With the

approach of imposing a potential, we have a powerful technique to describe distributions and their

underlaying imposed transfers. The master equation of random transfer (eq. 15) converges to the gen-

eral distribution (eq. 17) and allows to discuss analytical results for a large variety of biased random

money transfer scenarios. Since the approach is so near to the mathematics of quantum mechanics,

we  expect  many  more  insights  and  cross-transfers  from  physics.  Moreover,  the  given  potential

approach can be applied to other quantities which are exchanged or regulated in an economy.

We have found that any application of quantity theory has to operate under imposed boundary condi-

tions. Central banks have changed their definition of the quantity of money several times. The FED

and the swiss central bank eventually gave up to  define it.  Our findings  suggest that the boundary

conditions are essential and their change over time has to be considered. When central banks want to

regulate monetary value over time, they may profit from the shown general potential theory of mone-

tary systems.

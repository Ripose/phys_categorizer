Abstract 

The  SLAC  PES,  developed  in  the  early  1990s  for  the  SLC,  has  been  in 
continuous  use  since  1992,  during  which  time  it  has  undergone  numerous 
upgrades.  The  upgrades  include  improved  cathodes  with  their  matching  laser 
systems,  modified  activation  techniques  and  better  diagnostics.  The  source 
itself  and  its  performance  with  these  upgrades  will  be  described  with  special 
attention  given  to  recent  high-intensity  long-pulse  operation  for  the  E-158 
fixed-target parity-violating experiment.

Abstract. The SLAC PES, developed in the early 1990s for the SLC, has been in continuous 
use since 1992, during which time it has undergone numerous upgrades. The upgrades include 
improved  cathodes  with  their  matching  laser  systems,  modified  activation  techniques  and 
better diagnostics. The source itself and its performance with these upgrades will be described 
with special attention given to recent high-intensity long-pulse operation for the E-158 fixed-
target parity-violating experiment. 

1 INTRODUCTION 

The polarized electron source (PES) [1] was initially commissioned for the SLC 
in early 1992. The present post-SLC configuration is shown in Fig. 1. The all solid-
state Nd:YLF-pumped Ti:sapphire short-pulse laser is used for filling PEP-II and for 
other  experiments  not  requiring  polarized  electrons.  The  flash  lamp-pumped  long-
pulse  Ti:sapphire  laser1  has  been  recently  improved    for  a  fixed-target  experiment2 
that requires a high-charge polarized beam. The characteristics of the PES are listed 
in Table 1. Which of the two laser beams is delivered to the cathode is chosen on a 
pulse-to-pulse basis.  Improvements to the source are discussed in Section 2 and its 
present performance in Section 3.   

2 IMPROVEMENTS 

Given the uncertainties of operating a major accelerator with a polarized electron 
source,  four  guns  were  built  for  the  following  purposes:  one  operating,  one  on 
standby,  one  being  repaired,  and  one  for  experiments  in  the  off-line  laboratory 
consisting  of  a  duplicate  of  the  first  few  meters  of  the  3-km  linac.  However,  the 
addition of a load-lock3 in 1993 improved the reliability of the PES to such an extent

3Before biasing the cathode, most of the load-lock apparatus must be removed and a corona shield installed around the high-

voltage (HV) electrode. Because of space constraints in the linac housing, the HV insulator and corona shield is surrounded 
by dry gas contained within a sealed shroud.

that certainly no more than  3  guns are now needed.  All activations4 are done in the 
load-lock  with  the  gun  isolated.  Re-application  of  Cs  to  the  cathode  is  done 
periodically in the gun chamber under computer control (operator initiated) with the 
bias  voltage  reduced  to  1  kV.  Cesium  channels  from  SAES  are  used  exclusively. 
Additional NF3 is not added inbetween activations. To monitor the cathode quantum 
efficiency (QE), a low-power cw diode laser is mounted on a side window of the gun 
with a view of the cathode. The laser is modulated at a few hertz to minimize the cw 
beam  in  the  linac.  A  fiber-optically  coupled  nanoammeter  installed  at  the  gun  HV 
electrode support flange supplies a modulated current signal to a lock-in amplifier as 
shown in Fig. 2. The control chassis also blanks off the diode laser during the linac rf 
accelerating  pulse  to  prevent  any  acceleration  of  photoelectrons  generated  by  this 
source.5

The addition of the load-lock required the cathode to be mounted on a detachable 
puck that is supported by a 2.5-cm diameter emitter tube made from a 8-cm long Mo 
cup  brazed  to  a  Kovar  tube,  which  is  welded  to  a  304L  stainless-steel  (SST)  tube. 
During  operation,  cold  N2  is  circulated  inside  the  tube  to  lower  the  cathode 
temperature to about 0  (cid:1)C. When activating, a  resistive heater is installed. To bring 
the GaAs crystal to the desired 600 (cid:1)C, even with a heat shield on the vacuum side of

the  crystal,  the  puck  end  of  the  emitter  tube  reaches  about  800(cid:1)C,  which  formerly 
resulted  in    frequent  vacuum  failures  of  the  Mo-Kovar  brazed  joint.    Ni-plating  the 
Kovar prior to brazing helped.6 Eventually  an ANSYS 5.1 study of the temperature 
response  was  used  to  determine  the  optimum  length  of  the  Mo  cup  to  keep  the 
temperature  of  the  brazed  joint  below  250  (cid:1)C  [2].  A  new  Mo-length  of  31  cm  was 
chosen. Computer controlled temperature-cycling tests resulted in no failures after 70 
cycles. To reduce hazards, the gas mixture in the shroud can now be readily switched 
from  SF6  to  dry  air  or  to  a  mixture  of  both.  Generally  SF6  is  used  only  in  the  first 
couple days of operation following closure of the shroud.

The  major  improvement  is  in  the  cathode  itself.  The  progress  toward  higher 
polarization  is  illustrated  in  Table  2.  There  has  been  only  limited  success  in 
improving  the  cathode  preparation  technique.  A  vacuum  transfer  vessel  allows  the 
cathode to be activated in the laboratory and then transferred to the load-lock system 
at the gun under vacuum. The vessel has a small battery-operated IP, but nonetheless 
a  final  re-activation  in  the  load-lock  is  generally  necessary.  A  glove-box  for 
performing  the  initial  cathode  cleaning  in  an  N2  atmosphere  has  also  been 
constructed, but so far not used. Presently H* cleaning at 400 (cid:1)C is being studied. 7 

3 PERFORMANCE 

Since  1992  the  polarized  electron  source  has  provided  ~80%  of  the  electron 
beams  for  the  SLAC  linac,  accumulating  nearly  40,000  h  of  operation  with 
availability >>95%. Except for 1992  (when there was no load-lock) the pattern has 
been  as  follows,  independent  of  the  type  of  cathode  used  (listed  in  Table  2).  After 
initial  activation  in  the  load-lock,  the  cathode  is  inserted  into  the  gun.  Neither  the 
cathode  bias  HV  nor  the  presence  of  the  electron  beam  are  observed  to  have  any

effect on the QE. When the QE decreases to the point where the required current can 
no longer be obtained—because of limited laser energy and/or because of the surface 
charge limit—the cathode is re-cesiated in the gun with the cathode bias reduced to –
1 kV. This typically occurs every 3-5 days and takes ~20 min., the time dominated 
by  cycling  of  the  bias  voltage.  About  0.5  ML  Cs  is  estimated  to  be  added  per  re-
cesiation. No NF3 is added. The re-cesiation completely restores the original QE. The 
rate  of  decrease  of  the  QE  (QE  lifetime)  changes  over  long  periods  (generally  to 
shorter lifetimes), but not between re-cesiations. Re-cesiations are repeated up to 50 
times  over  the  period  of  a  year,  limited  only  by  operational  considerations  to 
preemptively change the cathode during the accelerator scheduled major mainte-

An RGA scan for the present gun, which has not been back-filled for several years, is 
shown in Fig. 3. The RGA is operated continuously. 

The high charge that can be generated with the new gradient-doped strained-layer 
GaAsP-GaAs  cathodes  [3]  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  4.  Note  the  absence  of  saturation 
effects in the upper curve, which is generated using a 100-ns laser pulse. Due to the 
longer  pulse  length  of  300-ns,  the  current  density  in  the  lower  curve  is  much  less 
than the upper one for the same laser energy. For both curves, the laser illuminates a 
20-mm  diameter  spot  on  the  cathode.  The  parameters  achieved  for  the  currently 
running E158 using this new cathode are compared with those required for NLC in 
Table 3.

4 CONCLUSIONS 

The SLAC polarized electron source has proven to be an outstanding performer 
since  its  initial  commissioning  in  1992.  The  source  produces  a  charge  for  the 
presently running E158 that is close to that required for an NLC macropulse. Even 
higher charge has been demonstrated. Work continues at SLAC to develop a reliable 
low-temperature  activation  technique  to  provide  more  flexibility  for  the  gradient-
doped cathodes. Higher polarization is being explored, principally using superlattice 
semiconductor structures.

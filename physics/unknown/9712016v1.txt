Abstract

In this work we present a formal generalization of the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism,

recently developed for singular systems, to include the case of Lagrangians con-

taining variables which are elements of Berezin algebra. We derive the Hamilton-

Jacobi equation for such systems, analizing the singular case in order to obtain

the equations of motion as total diﬀerential equations and study the integrability

conditions for such equations. An example is solved using both Hamilton-Jacobi

and Dirac’s Hamiltonian formalisms and the results are compared.

1 Introduction

In this work we intend to study singular systems with Lagrangians containing

elements of Berezin algebra from the point of view of the Hamilton-Jacobi for-

malism recently developed [1, 2]. The study of such systems through Dirac’s

generalized Hamiltonian formalism has already been extensively developed in lit-

erature [3, 4, 5] and will be used for comparative purposes.

Despite the success of Dirac’s approach in studying singular systems, which

is demonstrated by the wide number of physical systems to which this formal-

ism has been applied, it is always instructive to study singular systems through

other formalisms, since diﬀerent procedures will provide diﬀerent views for the

same problems, even for nonsingular systems. The Hamilton-Jacobi formalism

that we study in this work has been already generalized to higher order singular

systems [6, 7] and applied only to a few number of physical examples as the elec-

tromagnetic ﬁeld [8], relativistic particle in an external Electromagnetic ﬁeld [9]

and Podolsky’s Electrodynamics [6]. But a better understanding of this approach

utility in the studying singular systems is still lacking, and such understanding

can only be achieved through its application to other interesting physical systems.

Besides that, Berezin algebra is a useful way to deal simultaneously with

bosonic and fermionic variables in a unique and compact notation, what justiﬁes

the interest in studying systems composed by its elements using new formalisms.

The aim of this work is not only to generalize the Hamilton-Jacobi approach

for singular systems to the case of Lagrangians containing Berezinian variables

but to present an example of its application to a well known physical system,

comparing the results to those obtained through Dirac’s method.

We will start in section 2 with some basic deﬁnitions and next, in section

3, we will introduce the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to Berezinian systems using

Carath´eodory’s equivalent Lagrangians method. In section 4 the singular case

is considered and the equations of motion are obtained as a system of total dif-

ferential equations whose integrability conditions are analyzed in section 5. The

equivalence among these integrability conditions and Dirac’s consistency condi-

tions will be discussed separately in the appendix. In section 6 we present, as

an example, the electromagnetic ﬁeld coupled to a spinor, which is studied using

both the formalism presented in this work and Dirac’s Hamiltonian one. Finally,

the conclusions are presented in section 7.

2 Basic deﬁnitions

We will start from a Lagrangian L

that must be an even function of a set

.
q

q,

(cid:17)
of N variables qi that are elements of Berezin algebra. For a basic introduction

(cid:16)

in such algebra we suggest the reader to refer to ref. [3], appendix D, from which

we took the deﬁnitions used in this paper. A more complete treatment can be

found in ref. [10].

ciples from the action S =

Ldt

The Lagrangian equations of motion can be obtained through variational prin-

were we must call attention to the use of right derivatives.

The passage to Hamiltonian formalism is made, as usual, by deﬁning the

momenta variables through right derivatives as

H = pi

.
qi

−L,

were the ordering of momenta to the left of velocities shall be observed since they

were deﬁned as right derivatives. This ordering will be, of course, irrelevant when

we deal with even elements of the Berezin algebra. The Hamiltonian equations

of motion will be given by

pi= −

∂qi = − (−1)P(i) ∂lH

If we use the Poisson bracket in the Berezin algebra, given by

{F, G}B =

− (−1)P(F )P(G) ∂rG

,

we get the known expressions

For simplicity and clarity we will refer to these brackets as Berezin brackets.

These brackets have similar properties to the usual Poisson brackets

{F, G}B = − (−1)P(F )P(G) {G, F }B ,

{F, GK}B = {F, G}B K + (−1)P(F )P(G) G {F, K}B ,

+ (−1)P(K)P(G) {K, {F, G}B}B = 0,

(9)

were the last expression is the analogue of Jacobi’s identity.

Similarly to the usual case, the transition to phase space is only possible if the

momenta variables, given by Eq. (2), are independent variables among themselves

6

(10)

so that we can express all velocities

.qi as functions of canonical variables (qi, pi).

Such necessity implies that the Hessian supermatrix

Hij ≡

∂rpi
qj =
.
∂

∂2
r L
.
qi

.
qj

∂

must be nonsingular. Otherwise, if the Hessian has a rank P = N − R, there will

be R relations among the momenta variables and coordinates qi that are primary

constraints (that we suppose to have deﬁnite parity), while R velocities

.qi

will

remain arbitrary variables in the theory. The development of Dirac’s General-

ized Hamiltonian Formalism is straightforward: the primary constraints have to

be added to the Hamiltonian, we have to work out the consistency conditions,

separate the constraints in ﬁrst and second-class ones and deﬁne the Dirac brack-

ets using the supermatrix whose elements are the Poisson brackets among the

second-class constraints [3].

3 Hamilton-Jacobi formalism

From Carath´eodory’s equivalent Lagrangians method [11] we can obtain the Ha-

milton-Jacobi equation for the even Lagrangian L

. The procedure is similar

to the one applied to usual variables: given a Lagrangian L, we can obtain a

completely equivalent one given by

L′ = L

.
qi

qi,

−

dS (qi, t)
dt

,

(cid:17)
were S (qi, t) is an even function in order to keep the equivalent Lagrangian even.

(cid:16)

These Lagrangians are equivalent because their respective action integrals

have simultaneous extremum. Then we choose the function S (qi, t) in such a way
that we get an extremum of L′ and, consequently, an extremum of the Lagrangian

L.

For this purpose, it is enough to ﬁnd a set of functions βi(qj, t) and S (qi, t)

such that

and for all neighborhood of

(cid:16)

> 0.

(cid:17)
With these conditions satisﬁed, the Lagrangian L′ (and consequently L) will

(cid:16)

have a minimum in

= βi(qj, t) so that the solutions of the diﬀerential equations

.
qi

will correspond to an extremum of the action integral.

Now, using the deﬁnitions for the conjugated momenta given by Eq. (2), we

get

We can see from this result and from Eq. (13) that, in order to obtaining an

extremum of the action, we must get a function S (qj, t) such that

where H0 is the canonical Hamiltonian

and the momenta pi are given by Eq. (15). Besides, Eq. (16) is the Hamilton-

Jacobi partial diﬀerential equation (HJPDE).

4 The singular case

We now consider the case of a system with a singular Lagrangian. When the

Hessian supermatrix is singular with a rank P = N −R we can deﬁne the variables

qi in such order that the P × P supermatrix in the right bottom corner of the

Hessian supermatrix be nonsingular, i.e.

det |Hab| 6= 0; Hab =

This allows us to solve the velocities

as functions of coordinates q′s and

momenta pa, i.e.,

= f a (qi, pb).

.
qa

There will remain R momenta variables pα dependent upon the other canonical

variables, and we can always [3, 4, 12] write expressions like

pα = −Hα

; α = 1, ..., R;

(21)

(23)

(24)

that correspond to the Dirac’s primary constraints Φα ≡ pα + Hα (qi; pa) ≈ 0.

The Hamiltonian H0, given by Eq. (17), becomes

H0 = paf a + pα|pβ=−Hβ

Now we will adopt the following notation: the time parameter t will be called

t0 ≡ q0; the coordinates qα will be called tα; the momenta pα will be called Pα

and the momentum p0 ≡ P0 will be deﬁned as

P0 ≡

∂S
∂t

.

Then, to get an extremum of the action integral, we must ﬁnd a function

S (tα; qa, t) that satisﬁes the following set of HJPDE

H ′

0 ≡ P0 + H0

t, tβ; qa; pa =

where α, β = 1, ..., R. If we let the indexes α and β run from 0 to R we can write

both equations as

H ′

α ≡ Pα + Hα

tβ; qa; pa =

 

∂rS

S (tα; qa) uniquely from the initial conditions.

5 Integrability conditions

The analysis of integrability conditions of the total diﬀerential equations (26),

(30) and (31) can be carried out using standard techniques. This have already

been made [2, 13, 14] for systems with usual variables, and here we will present

the analysis of the integrability conditions for Berezinian singular systems.

To a given set of total diﬀerential equations

(i, j = 0, 1, ..., N and α, β = 0, 1, ..., R < N) we may associate a set of partial

where

Given any twice diﬀerentiable solution of the set (33), it should also satisfy

[Xα, Xβ] f =

XαXβ − (−1)P(α)P(β) XβXα

(cid:17)

is the bracket among the operators Xα. This implies that we should have

[Xα, Xβ] f = Cαβ

13

So, the commutation relations (35) will give the maximal number of linearly

independent equations. Any commutator that results in a expression that can’t

be written as Eq. (36) must be written as a new operator X and be joined to
the original set (33), having all commutators with the other X ′s calculated. The

process is repeated until all operators X satisfy Eq. (36).

If all operators Xα satisfy the commutation relations given by Eq. (36) the

system of partial diﬀerential equations (33) is said to be complete and the corre-

sponding system of total diﬀerential equations (32) is integrable if, and only if,

the system (33) is complete.

Now, we consider the system of diﬀerential equations obtained in the previous

section. First we shall observe that if the total diﬀerential equations (26) and (30)

are integrable the solutions of Eq. (31) can be obtained by a quadrature, so we

only need to analyze the integrability conditions for the last ones, since the former

will be integrable as a consequence.

The operators Xα corresponding to the system of total diﬀerential equations

formed by Eq. (26) and Eq. (30) are given by,

6 Example

As an example we analyze the case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld coupled to a

spinor, whose Hamiltonian formalism was analyzed in references [3, 4]. We will

consider the Lagrangian density written as

L = −

FµνF µν + i ψ γµ (∂µ + ieAµ) ψ − m ψ ψ,

(47)

4

where Aµ are even variables while ψ and ψ are odd ones. The electromagnetic

tensor is deﬁned as F µν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ and we are adopting the Minkowski

metric ηµν = diag(+1, −1, −1, −1).

6.1 Hamiltonian formalism

Let’s ﬁrst review Dirac’s Hamiltonian formalism. The momenta variables conju-

gated, respectively, to Aµ, ψ and ψ, are

pµ =

µ = −F0µ,

where we must call attention to the necessity of being careful with the spinor

indexes. Considering, as usual, ψ as a column vector and ψ as a row vector

implies that pψ will be a row vector while pψ will be a column vector.
From the momenta expressions we have the primary constraints

φ1 = p0 ≈ 0,

φ2 = pψ − i ψ γ0, φ3 = pψ ≈ 0.

where λ1 is an even variable and λ2, λ3 are odd variables, λ2 being a column vector

and λ3 a row vector. The fundamental nonvanishing Berezin brackets (here the

brackets are the ones deﬁned by Eq. (5) in the 2N phase space) are

{Aµ (x) , pν (y)}B = δµ

{φ3, HP }B = −i (∂j + ieAj) γjψ + eγ0A0ψ + mψ − iγ0λ2 ≈ 0.

The last two ones will determine λ2 and λ3 while the ﬁrst one will give rise to

the secondary constraint

χ = ∂ipi − e ψ γ0ψ ≈ 0,

for which the consistency condition will be identically satisﬁed with the use of

the expressions for λ2 and λ3 given by Eq. (59) and Eq. (60). Taking the Berezin

have this supermatrix in normal form (see ref.[3], appendix D) given, with spinor

7 Conclusions

In this work we presented a formal generalization of the Hamilton-Jacobi for-

malism for singular systems with Berezinian variables, obtaining the equations

of motion as total diﬀerential equations (26) and (30). In these equations, the

coordinates qα = tα (α = 1, ..., R), whose momenta are constrained, play the role

of evolution parameters of the system, together with the time parameter t = t0.

So, the system’s evolution is described by contact transformations generated by
the “Hamiltonians” H ′
related to the canonical Hamiltonian by Eq. (22) and the other H ′

α and parametrized by tα (with α = 0, 1, ..., R), were H ′

α (α = 1, ..., R)

0 is

are the constraints given by Eq. (23). This evolution is considered as being always

restricted to the constraints surface in phase space, there is no complete phase

space treatment that is latter reduced to the constraints surface, as in Dirac’s

formalism with the use of weak equalities.

We should observe that, in the case of systems composed exclusively by even

variables, all parities are equal to zero and equations (26), (30), (31) reduce to

the results obtained in ref.[1]. Furthermore, if the system is nonsingular, we have
H ′

α ≡ 0 except for α = 0, so the total diﬀerential equations (26) and (30) will be

reduced to the expressions given by Eq. (4).

The integrability conditions (which relation to the consistency conditions in

Dirac’s formalism is discussed in the appendix) were shown to be equivalent to the
necessity of the vanishing of the variation of each H ′

α (α = 0, ..., R), i.e. dH ′

α = 0.

The example presented was chosen for its completeness: it is a singular system

with even and odd variables and its Hamiltonian treatment contains all kinds of

constraints (primary and secondary, ﬁrst and second class ones). This example

is very illustrative, since it allows a comparison between all features of Dirac’s

and Hamilton-Jacobi formalisms. For example, the fact that the integrability

24

conditions dH ′

3 = 0 give expressions involving some diﬀerentials dtα
is related to the fact that the corresponding Hamiltonian constraints φ2 and φ3

2 = 0 and dH ′

are second class constraints and determine some of the arbitrary parameters in
the primary Hamiltonian (54). Similarly, the fact that the condition dH ′
generated an expression like H ′

4 = 0 is related to the fact that the corresponding

1 = 0

Hamiltonian constraint φ1 is a ﬁrst class one (see appendix).

Finally, we must call attention to the presence of arbitrary variables in some

of the Hamiltonian equations of motion due to the fact that we have gauge de-

pendent variables and we have not made any gauge ﬁxing. This does not occur

in Hamilton-Jacobi formalism since it provides a gauge-independent description

of the systems evolution due to the fact that the Hamilton-Jacobi function S

contains all the solutions that are related by gauge transformations.

8 Appendix: Equivalence among consistency

and integrability conditions

In this appendix we will show the equivalence among the integrability conditions

of the formalism showed above and the consistency conditions in Dirac’s Hamil-

tonian formalism, in a similar way to what was made for usual variables [16]. In

the notation used in this paper the Dirac’s primary constraints are written, from

Eq. (23), as

where α = 1, ..., R; i = 1, ..., N. The canonical Hamiltonian is given by H0 in Eq.

(20), so the primary Hamiltonian HP is

HP ≡ H0 + H ′

(108)

25

.qα

where the vα are unknown coeﬁcients related to the undetermined velocities
[4]. The ordering of the vα with respect to the H ′

α is a matter of choice, since it

will simply produce a change of sign, but the natural procedure, that identiﬁes

vα and

.
qα

, suggests the ordering above as a consequence of the ordering adopted

in the Hamiltonian (3). This ordering is also the most natural choice to our

purpose but is, of course, irrelevant for systems containing only usual variables.

The consistency conditions, which demand that the constraints preserved by time

evolition, are written as

have dH ′

consistency conditions are satisﬁed. The Hamiltonian equation of motion for H ′

dH ′

0 ≈ {H ′

(111)

(112)

Remembering that the “momentum” P0 in H ′

0 is independent of the canonical

variables qi and pi, we have

dH ′

0 ≈ {H0, H0}B dt + {H0, H ′

α}B dtα = {H0, H ′

α}B dtα.

(113)

26

(114)

But, if Dirac’s consistency conditions are satisﬁed, we must have only pri-

mary ﬁrst class constraints, otherwise we would have conditions imposed on the

unknown velocities

. So, the preservation of constraints in time will reduce to

.qα

H ′
n

µ, H0

≈ 0,

B

o

and the right side of Eq. (113) will be zero. This is simply a consequence of the

fact that, once all Dirac’s conditions are satisﬁed, the Hamiltonian is preserved.
So the condition dH ′

0 = 0 is satisﬁed when Dirac’s consistency conditions are

satisﬁed.

This shows that the integrability conditions in Hamilton-Jacobi formulation

will be satisﬁed when Dirac’s consistency are satisﬁed. Similarly, we can consider
that we have the integrability conditions satisﬁed so that dH ′

µ = 0 and

0 = dH ′

then Eq. (110), which is equivalent to Eq. (109), implies that Dirac’s conditions

are satisﬁed. So, both conditions are equivalent.

Now, we will consider that these conditions are not initialy satisﬁed. When

we have only ﬁrst class constraints in Hamiltonian formalism we will simply get

a new constraint from some of the conditions (109). From Eq.
(110) we see
µ = H ′dt (H ′ ≈ 0 is the secondary
that this will imply an expression like dH ′
Hamiltonian constraint) which means that there will be a new H ′ in Hamilton-
Jacobi formalism that have to satisfy dH ′ = 0.

If we have some second class Hamiltonian constraints the consistency condi-

tions (109) will imply a condition over some of the velocities

we see that, in Hamilton-Jacobi approach, there will be conditions imposed on

some diﬀerentials dtα.

presented in this paper.

Such correspondence among the formalisms can be clearly seen in the example

were now α, µ = 0, 1, ..., R and the Berezin bracket is again deﬁned in the 2N + 2

dimensional phase space containing t0 and P0. This equation is obviously identical
to Eq. (45), that leads to the integrability condition dH ′

µ = 0, and its right hand

side was showed to correspond to Dirac’s consistency conditions. Consequently,

this expression shows directly the relation among consistency and integrability

conditions.

It’s important to notice that here we are not considering any explicity de-

pendence on time, neither of the constraints nor of the canonical Hamiltonian,

because it is an usual procedure in Hamiltonian approach. But the equations

of Hamilton-Jacobi formalism were obtained without considering this condition

and, consequently, remain valid if we consider systems with Lagrangians that are

explicitily time dependent.

But Hamiltonian approach is also applicable to such systems (see reference [3],

page 229) and in this case we can follow a procedure similar to that one showed

here and demonstrate the correspondence among Dirac’s consistency conditions

and integrability conditions.

Finally, some words about the simpletic structure. Using Eq. (38), we can

writte Eq. (26) and Eq. (30) in terms of left derivatives as

where, as before, i = 0, 1, ..., N and α = 0, 1, ..., R. These expressions can be

compactly written as

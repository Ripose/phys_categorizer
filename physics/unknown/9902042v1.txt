We  implemented  a  low  noise  current  looped  preamplifier  for  the  readout  of

resistive bolometers. We tested the apparatus on thermometer resistances ranging from

1 kW

 to 500 MW

. The use of looped  preamplifier overcomes constraints introduced by

the readout time constant due to the thermometer  resistance  and  the  input  capacitance.

Using  cold  JFETs,  this  preamplifier  board  is  shown  to  have  very  low  noise:  the

Johnson noise of the source resistor (1 fA/Hz-1/2) dominated in our noise measurements.

We  also  implemented  a  lock-in  chain  using  this  preamplifier.  Because  of  fast

risetime,  compensation  of  the  phase  shift  may  be  unnecessary.  If  implemented,  no

tuning is necessary when the sensor impedance changes. Transients are very short,  and

thus low-passing or sampling of the signal is simplified. In case of spurious noise,  the

1

modulation  frequency  can  be  chosen  in  a  much  wider  frequency  range,  without

requiring a new calibration of the apparatus.

Introduction

Low  temperature  bolometers  address  detection  problems  that  require  high

sensitivity,  high-energy  resolution  and/or  low  thresholds:  X-ray  and  far  infrared

spectroscopy, double beta decay, Dark Matter particle searches. To reduce thermal noise

they must be operated at temperature generally in  the  10-300  milliKelvin  range.  Their

performance  critically  depends  on  the  quality  of  the  thermometer  and  on  the  readout

electronics and wiring of the apparatus. This work  relies on the experience acquired by

the  detector  community  [3,  4].  In  ref.  [1]  we  discussed  different  preamplifiers

configurations. This paper describes the implementation and  test  results  of  the  looped

current preamplifier, and the design of a lock-in detection chain using it.

Cryogenic  constraints:

We assume in the following that the thermometers used are resistive, of the order

of 1 MW

 resistance, or more.  In this context, JFETs,  MOSFET, AsGa  MESFET  and

HEMT are natural candidates for front end devices. For  example, Allessandrello  et  al.

[5] designed a voltage preamplifier using AsGa transistors,  working at a temperature of

1K,  and dissipating only 54 mW.  The  main  drawback  of  MOSFET  and  MESFET  is

that up to now, their low frequency noise performance is poorer than the commercially

available JFET.  Since we expect detector Johnson  noises of the order of few nV/Hz1/2

(few fA/Hz1/2), we were led to choose JFETs,  known  to achieve voltage noises of the

order of 1 nV/Hz1/2 and current noises of the order of 0.1 fA/Hz1/2. One could consider

placing the  full  preamplifier  at  cryogenic  temperature  as  in  [5],  but  this  is  expensive

because  of  liquid  helium  consumption.  We  decided  to  run  the  preamplifier  at  room

temperature, only the JFET being cold.  We used JFET power dissipation ranging from

0.5  mW to 10 mW,  per channel: the  more  power  in  the  JFET,  the  lower  the  voltage

noise. In some cryostats, the JFET can be anchored to the liquid nitrogen shield, where

thermal dissipation is not expensive. But most dilution or  3He  cryostats  do  not  allow

this,  and  the  JFET  has  to  be  placed  at  4K  stage.  Then  the  user  has  to  make  a

2

compromise  between  the  helium  boiling  rate  and  voltage  noise  in  the  JFET.

Unfortunately, silicon JFETs  do not work  at 4 K  and to minimise voltage  and  current

noise, the JFET has to be cooled to a temperature between 130 K  and 180 K.  Thus we

had to place the JFET on a computed thermal impedance.

The temperature increase of the bolometer (due to particle interaction or Infrared

incoming  power)  induces  a  variation  of  the  thermometer  impedance.  Signals  may  be

slow: from 1 second to few m s.  We wish  then to use a DC coupled preamplifier. But,

when  powered,  the  JFET  self  heats  to  a  temperature  around  150  K.  Gate  to  source

JFET voltage do depends on the temperature. To prevent the amplification of the offset

voltage  one  may  use  a  differential  preamplifier  [6].  This  option  is  expensive  in  a

cryogenic environment, because it requires four wires per channel to bias the JFETs  of

the first stage,  doubles the power dissipation  at  4  K,  and  increases  the  white  voltage

noise by a factor of  2 .  We choose to use single JFET,  with  the  drawback  that  it  is

more sensitive to pickup noise and a biasing regulation of the JFET is necessary. This

JFET biasing regulation will bring a very low  frequency  high-pass  filter  behaviour  in

the preamplifier.

The  coldest  stage  of  most  low  temperature  cryostats  cannot  handle  power

dissipation  larger  than  1  m W.  Thus  the  readout  JFET  cannot  stay  right  next  to  the

detector. Typically, front end JFETs are placed at 20 to 40 cm from the detector. Due to

the  thermometer  high  impedance,  microphonics  and  electromagnetic  noise  pickup  as

well as capacitance of the wiring then become  crucial problems, and great care has to be

taken, to optimise the wiring from these points of view. We decided to design and order

low capacitance, low noise cryogenic coaxial cables. Their performance turned out to be

quite satisfactory.

To  summarise  the  configuration,  we  chose  to  design  a  low  noise  wide

bandwidth,  DC  coupled  JFET  preamplifier.  Active  regulation  of  the  current  flowing

through the JFET will high-pass frequencies below 0.1  Hz.  The power  applied  to  the

JFET range from 0.5 mW to 10 mW. It is thermally anchored to the 4.2K  liquid helium

3

or liquid nitrogen bath, depending of the cryostat schematic, through computed thermal

impedance so as to achieve a stabilised temperature close of 150 K.

Preamplifier        design

From the electronics point of view, the goal was  to design a state of the art low

noise preamplifier to achieve the best threshold and resolution performances.  So  as  to

allow  detector  characterisation  and  optimisation,  readout  had  to  induce  minimal

distortion of the thermal signal of the bolometer. But large thermometer impedance and

stray capacitance low-pass the signal. Since reference [2] we rediscovered and enhanced

what Silver et al. [7] had previously used to readout fast microcalorimeter.

Schematic

Figure  1  shows 

the  simplified  schematic  of 

the 

looped  preamplifier

configuration. A heat pulse induces a resistance change of the thermometer.  A  biasing

voltage Vp is applied to the thermometer. The operational amplifier actively regulates the

voltage at its inverted input to be zero and the stray capacitance Cs does not charge. Thus

the signal is not low-passed with the time constant Rb Cs.

   where s  is the Laplace variable,  Rb

and  Rf    are  the  bolometer  and  feedback  resistance,  Cb,  Cf  are  the  bolometer  and  the

feedback stray capacitance, and Cs  the input capacitance of the preamplifier.

To  achieve  this  in  the  context  presented  in  the  introduction,  we  designed  a

preamplifier board whose schematic is given in figure 2.

The electronic circuit runs  at room temperature  outside  the  cryostat,  except  for

the JFET,  staying at 77K  or 4 K,  and the bolometer and feedback resistor on the cold

plate of the cryostat.

Preamplifier  loop

The preamplifier loop (figure 2) includes two circuits. First a very fast common

base  current  amplifier  of  gain  5  amplifies  the  small  signal  current  coming  from  the

4

JFET.  This amplifier raises the current above the input  current  noise  of  the  following

AD844.  The AD844 further amplifies the current with an open loop transresistance gain

of 3 MW

 yielding the preamplifier output. A feedback resistor (R 18)  has  been  added

between the output and inverted input of the AD844 to allow the tuning the open  loop

gain of the preamplifier.

FET biasing circuit

From the basic schematic, when no voltage bias is applied, we expect the output

of  the  preamplifier  to  be  close  to  ground.  Since  the  gate  current  of  the  cold  FET  is

negligible, this is the equilibrium condition of this preamplifier too.  To achieve this,  we

have  to  adjust  the  JFET  source  voltage,  to  ensure  the  proper  DC  conditions.  This

voltage depends of the FET temperature and an active correction of offset is necessary to

prevent the output from saturating. This is the purpose of the OPA111 based integrator

circuit.  Assuming  no  input  voltage  from  “Polar  DC”  (a  lock-in  symmetrical  square

waveform  is  used),  the  integrator  integrates  the  output  voltage  of  the  preamplifier.

Through R22, the OP111 output drives the JFET source voltage and cancels the offset

drifts.  The time constant of the  integrator  has  to  be  much  slower  than  the  pulse  time

scale,  since  it  high-passes  the  input  signals.  We  chose  t =1 s 

to  ensure  that  a

preamplifier is active one minute after being powered.  The biasing voltage is then low-

pass filtered to suppress noise from noise OPA 111.

Thermometer biasing circuits

The  biasing  of  the  thermometer  may  look  odd  in  this  configuration.  Two

common biasing conditions had to be implemented: when used to measure slow  signals

AC biasing and lock-in detection is often optimal, when used with fast bolometers  for

particle  interactions  DC  biasing  is  preferred.  The  difficulty  comes  from  the  fact  that

modulation is applied to the  lowest  noise  stage  of  the  preamplifier  so  the  modulation

voltage noise has to be lower than preamplifier noise.

Good oscillators generate signals of volts amplitude with noise level lower than

100 nV/Hz1/2.  It has to be divided by at  least  a  factor  100  to  meet  our  requirements.

This is the purpose of the R28 and R29 resistor divider. The carrier  signal  then  feeds

directly  the  thermometer.  We  emphasise  that  the  JFET  biasing  system  requires  the

modulation frequency to be above 20 Hz.

Applying a DC voltage to bias the thermistor is somehow incompatible with the

FET biasing circuit. If a constant voltage V is applied through the AC biasing circuit the

bolometer, the FET biasing circuit changes the FET source voltage to recover ground at

the  preamplifier  output.  The  FET  gate  potential  rises  to V
g

,  inducing  an

effective  polarisation  voltage  on  the  bolometer  V
p

.  Typical  operating

biasing potentials of thermometer  are  in  the  10 mV  range,  and  the  resistor  ratios  are

typically  of  10.  This  induces  gate  potentials  of  few  100  mV,  and  sets  two  potential

problems. First when the gate wire  is  no  longer  grounded,  microphonics  interference

happens  through  the  varying  capacitance  between  the  gate  wire  and  its  grounded

shielding. Second, because of low power cryogenic requirements, the FET is run with a

drain voltage below 3 volts.  Changing the source and gate potential by a 100 mV may

To prevent this,  we implemented an additional feature for DC biasing. We apply a DC

before further amplification of the signal, but  we  assumed  our  signals  were  relatively

fast in this detection mode. This is the purpose of the C5 capacitor, when not shorted.

Tests  results

Noise measurements

Noise  measurements  were  performed  in  two  conditions.  The  first  one  with  a

300 K JFET, and liquid nitrogen cooled high value feedback resistors. We operated our

apparatus with feedback resistors up to 10 GW

  the  thermometer  being  open  circuited.

The bandwidth of the preamplifier was limited to w

f =  1/( Rf  Cf).  We measured (figure

3)  current  noise  refereed  to  the  input  as  low  as  10—15 A.Hz-1/2,  dominated  by  the

Johnson  noise  of  the  feedback  resistor.  Noise  measurements  were  also  performed

within a cryostat. As described in the introduction, the JFET ran at 150 K  in  a  77 K

environment.  However  we  use  regular  cryogenic  coaxial  wiring,  because  we  cannot

afford  the  heat  load  of  the  available  low  noise  coaxial  wires.  Not  surprisingly,  the

observed spectrum on a 10 MW 

resistor at 320 mK  displays strong  microphonics  and

50 Hz  contamination.  Nevertheless,  on  the  plateau  we  measure  in~1.8 fA.Hz-1/2,

corresponding to the predicted value of resistor Johnson  noise.  Previous measurements

using a 50 MW  cold  resistor and  a  dilution  fridge  at  20 mK,  showed  the  cold  JFET

current noise is as low as 0.2 fA.Hz-1/2.

Bandwidth measurements

For this test, we placed the cold circuits in the 300 mK cryostat. A 1 MW

 resistor

was  readout  by  a  NJ132L  Interfet  JFET,  and  placed  in  series  with  a  Rf =  10  MW

MiniSystem  cold  resistor  [13].  Then  we  plugged  a  regular  voltage  amplifier  [2]  and

measured a bandwidth of 2.05 kHz,  corresponding to an input  capacitance  of  80  pF.

Plugging the above current preamplifier, we measured a bandwidth  of  45 kHz,  much

larger than the previous one  as  expected.  The  corresponding  stray  capacitance  on  the

feedback resistor is C f= 0.36 pF,  in accordance with the provider data  sheet  value  of

0.2 pF, and additional capacitance due to the wiring of the surface mount resistor chip.

Stability

When we first ran this preamplifier on a cold  very  resistive  bolometer  (Rb>Rf)

with Rf=107 W

 and C f=0.2 pF,  we saw    low  frequency  oscillations  of  the  amplifier,

similar to “motorboarding”. The  surprising  fact  was,  the  slower  the  preamplifier,  the

stronger were the oscillations. This effect can be understood as the following. Figure 4

shows a model of the poles of the circuit. The gain 5 current amplifier is fast enough so

that its effect is negligible is this discussion. The first pole of the open-loop amplifier is

dominated by AD844 chip.  The  cutting  angular  frequency  w

1  can  be  easily  computed

from  the  transresistance  of  the  chip  Rt=3 MW

  and  the  known  internal  lag  capacitor

Cl=5 pF:  w

1=1/(Rt Cl).  Assuming  that  the  thermometer  has  a  very  large  impedance,

two other poles are important:w

instability, w

f is a stabilising pole.  The purpose of the current looped preamplifier is to

move the first pole. To ensure stability w

f has to be less than w

1.  That was  not the case

since  w

1~6.6 104 rad.s-1  and  w

f~5 105 rad.s-1.  To  ensure  stability,  and  keep  a

relatively large bandwidth, we reduced the transresistance gain of the AD844 using the

200  kW

  R18  resistor,  and  achieving  w

l~106  rad.s-1  and  stability  on  high  impedance

thermometer.

Then,  starting  our  preamplifier  when  the  cryostat  was  at  4K,  and  the

thermometer  of  few  Ohms  impedance,  we  observed  the  output  of  the  preamplifier

oscillate rail to rail at a few Hz.  This behaviour does not happen when the thermometer

is of high impedance (Rb/Rf >0.01).  It is related to the FET biasing circuit, which is a

second slow loop. When the DC gain of the loop 

 is greater than unity the

circuit enters slow oscillation. If necessary, this oscillation can be prevented by placing

a cold resistor in series with the bolometer, without worsening the noise performance.

Practical limitations.

From the above discussion, two technological limitations to the rise-time appear.

The first one comes from the availability of low temperature feedback resistors.  The rise

time is set by the feedback resistor pole w

f =  1/(Rf Cf).  Most high ohmic value resistors

diverge to very high resistance, when placed at temperatures lower than 4K.  Using  the

MSI 10 MW

 resistors[13]  available on the market, (Cf =  0.2  pF)  we expect a rise time

of  4.4  m s,  independent  of  the  thermometer  impedance.  The  second  comes  from  the

stability criterion: w

f has to be lower than w

1.  This sets the shortest rise time achievable

with this board to 1 m s.

It must be pointed out that the thermal relaxation time of the bolometer is slower

using  the  looped  current  amplifier  configuration  than  a  looped  or  unlooped  voltage

amplifier. If this turns out to be a problem, the  same  preamplifier  could  be  used  as  a

very  good  looped  voltage  amplifier  [1].  Also,  under  extremely  strong  biasing,  the

detector preamplifier chain could become thermally unstable. This was  never  observed

by us as expected from simple calculations (see for example in reference [1]).

Lock-in        design        using       the       current        amplifier

When  the  thermal  signal  is  slower  than  a  few  tens  of  millisecond,  classical

readout electronics includes a lock-in amplifier to extract the signal from 1/f preamplifier

noise and microphonics. We designed test boards to demonstrate the  performance  and

convenience of a lock –in design using a current amplifier. So as to simplify design and

debugging we  placed  the  preamplifier,  oscillator  and  modulator/demodulator  on  three

distinct boards. Necessary signal exchanges was achieved through shielded twisted pair

cables,  to  prevent  pick  up.  This  choice  necessitated  the  use  of  numerous  differential

receivers  and  driver  chips.  In  future  implementations  of  this  circuit,  these  could  be

removed using a single board design.  The  test  boards  were  made  of  a  few  modules,

whose schematics are drawn at figure 5.  

10

A  pulse  generator  provides  an  adequate  frequency  reference  that  drives  the

modulator  and  the  time-delayed  carrier  mono-polar  square  waves.  These  are  used  to

trigger the modulator and demodulator AD630 chips.

Oscillator

Modulator

The modulator provides a square wave signal of chosen amplitude. So  as not to

degrade the resolution of measurements three  main  features  have  to  be  achieved.  The

noise on the square wave signal has to be smaller than 100 nV.Hz-1/2. Chips available on

the  market  meet  this  requirement  easily.  More  difficult  is  to  achieve  an  amplitude

stability of few 10-6/°C on a digitally chosen signal amplitude. This uncommon  feature

can be achieved on square wave signals using high performance DAC resistor  bridges

and a good voltage reference. The LM299 voltage reference  output  is  chopped  by  the

AD630 to produce a fixed amplitude stable symmetric square wave.  This square  wave

enters the reference  voltage  input  of  a  DAC  7541A  and  is  divided  by  the  DAC  high

stability  resistor’s  bridge  and  AD743  operational  amplifier.  The  C3  capacitor  allows

smoothing of ringing due to stray capacitors in the DAC. The output provides the square

wave biasing of the thermometer. Every part or chip relevant for the amplitude stability

was chosen to have a temperature coefficient smaller than 10-6/°C.

Demodulator

The  preamplifier  provides  a  detected  square  wave  with  minimal  distortion

(figure 6a): the  phase shift (time delay) is small and does not dependent on the sensor

impedance,  but  only  on  the  feedback  resistor.  Compensation  of  time  delay  might  be

unnecessary.  If  implemented,  it  will  reduce  transient  amplitudes  and  the  delay

adjustment is fixed: no tuning is necessary when sensor impedance changes.

The  demodulator  block  has  to  meet  the  same  amplitude  stability  requirement.

SSM2141  chips  provide  adequate  temperature  coefficients.  Then  the  time-delayed

oscillator output triggers the AD630 chip that  rectifies  the  square  wave.  The  resulting

signal is close to a constant voltage (figure 6b) with fast spike down to ground.  The DC

value  of  this  voltage  is  directly  related  to  the  thermometer  impedance,  and  is  an

11

important datum to register. Thus we implemented a “slow  output”  after  a  2  Hz  low-

pass filter. Most of the time however we are interested in faster very small signals.  Thus

for the “fast output”, we subtracted the signal DC value, and further amplified the signal

using an OP27A. To generate the offset tension, we used again a DAC7541A chip,  and

the same voltage reference as for the modulation (same board).  If this voltage reference

drifts,  then it generates no DC signal on the fast output. After  baseline  subtraction,  in

most applications a temperature coefficient of 10-4/°C is adequate. Commercial products

commonly achieve this.

Baseline subtraction and filtering issues.

Baseline subtraction induces another noise contribution. When  low-passing  the

OP 27A output, we get the average DC value of the signal. This value is offset from the

“true” value by the average of the integral of transients and can be easily corrected by the

offset subtraction. This implies that the gain of the lock-in loop depends somewhat on

the modulation frequency. If the modulation frequency is unstable, the gain and induced

offset changes too. This additional noise voltage is less than eoffset given by:

  e

offset

=

ATf
G

f
f

where  eoffset    is  the  equivalent  noise  contribution  (V.Hz-1/2)  at  the  input  of  the

preamplifier, A and T are the amplitude and the duration of transients, G  is the gain of

the electronic chain before subtraction, and f is  the  modulation  frequency.  For  typical

values (A= 10 V, T= 10m s,  G=5.103,  f=1kHz),  a frequency stability of 10-4 is enough

to ensure negligible noise contribution.

 After demodulation and offset subtraction, the output signal has to be low-pass

filtered in order to get rid  of  the  short  transients  (Figure  6b).  This  is  relatively  easy,

since the transients are of high frequency (more than 50 kHz) far above the harmonics

of  regular  modulating  frequencies.  But  unlike  in  most  lock-in  designs  in  order  to

remove  the  high  frequency  preamplifier  white  noise,  the  filter  has  to  be  at  least  of

second  order [1].

Tests       results   

We  measured  noise  spectrum  of  the  full  lock-in  chain.  All  of  measurements

showed  that  the  noise  of  the  lock-in  chain  is  dominated  by  the  preamplifier

contributions.  We  then  used  the  above  preamplifier  and  lock-in  to  study  two

bolometers, one constructed by Infrared Labs [11] and one fast bolometer model useful

for particle detectors.

As a validation tool for these developments we constructed a  300 mK  cryostat

and instrumented it with four channel cold  JFET  readout  electronic.  The  cryostat  is  a

Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) test cryostat [8] consisting of liquid nitrogen  cooled

first stage on which the JFET and wiring are thermally anchored, then of a pumped  4He

1.8 K  cold plate, where all the wiring is thermalised. Finally, we bought a single shot

pumped  3He  cryocooler from L. Duband[9].  This apparatus achieved a temperature of

315mK,  limited by the thermal load from the  25  cryogenic  coaxial  cables  used  in  the

readout electronics, with a  cold  plate  of  100  cm2  surface.  Computer  control  and  data

acquisition was  achieved through a GPIB  interface. The following measurements have

been made using the above presented current loop preamplifier and when necessary the

lock in chain.

Infrared  bolometer

 We  first  measured  the  IV  curves  of  the  Infrared  Labs  bolometer  [11]  kindly

provided by J-M. Lamarre. Figure 7 plots the results of the measurements, presented as

the  “blind”  bolometer  impedance  (no  infrared  light  power  incoming  the  bolometer)

versus  of the biasing thermal power load.  This  allowed  to  determine  the  thermometer

law  R(T)  and  the  thermal  conductivity  to  bath.  We  find  R T

complex, not dominated by a Kapitza resistance or a metal-like conductivity.

These measurements were performed at  a  modulation  frequency  of  20  Hz,  on

thermometer resistances up to 450 MW

. Using  a regular voltage preamplifier, the input

stray capacitance would have required measuring at modulation frequencies below 1 Hz,

considerably  lengthening  data  taking,  an  annoying  fact  on  a  single  shot  cryostat!

Furthermore, in case of spurious noise,  the modulation  frequency  can  be  chosen  in  a

much wider frequency range, without requiring a new calibration of the apparatus.

Pulses  data  acquisition

We use the current looped preamplifier to readout a fast bolometer model, made

of a 8x12x0.3mm3 Sapphire test plate onto which an NbSi thin film thermometer [10] is

evaporated. Heat leak was made of a gold wire,  wire-bonded on the Sapphire plate. An

241Am alpha source induced the detected heat pulses.

Figure 8 plots typical alpha  events  obtained  at  a  temperature  of  350  mK.  The

pulse shape displays two different regimes. A fast part, and a slow  relaxation. As stated

in [10,12],  the fast part is due to conversion of out of equilibrium phonons in the thin

film thermometer: the thermometer overheats relative to the Sapphire  substrate.  Within

few  tens  of  microseconds,  the  thermometer  temperature  relaxes  to  the  substrate

temperature, and then the whole device temperature relaxes through the heat leak. Had

we been using an unlooped voltage amplifier the fast signal part would have been low-

passed filtered by the input capacitance and thermometer resistance (80 pF  and 300 kW

)

of this device. Historically, this effect remained unknown until it was  found on  a  low

resistance thermometer (few kW

).

Conclusion

We  implemented  a  current  looped  preamplifier  for  the  readout  of  resistive

bolometers. We tested the apparatus on thermometer resistances ranging from 1 kW

  to

500 MW

.  We  showed  that  the  looped  current  amplifier  allows  much  flexibility  and

convenience in the design. Looped preamplifier overcomes constraints introduced by the

readout  time  constant  due  to  the  thermometer  resistance  and  the  input  capacitance.  It

allows the study of pulse shapes and detector behaviour that would be unnoticed using

unlooped  voltage  amplifier.  Using  a  cold  JFET,  this  preamplifier  board  is  shown  to

14

have very low noise: the Johnson noise of the source resistor (1 fA/Hz1/2) dominated in

our noise measurements.

We also implemented a lock-in chain. We showed  that it  is  very  convenient  to

use a looped preamplifier in a lock-in chain, with square wave biasing.  Compensation

of phase shifts might be unnecessary. If implemented, the adjustment is fixed, no tuning

is necessary when sensor impedance changes. Transients are very short,  and thus low-

passing  and  sampling  of  the  signal  is  simplified.  In  case  of  spurious  noise,  the

modulation  frequency  can  be  chosen  in  a  much  wider  frequency  range,  without

requiring a new calibration of the apparatus.

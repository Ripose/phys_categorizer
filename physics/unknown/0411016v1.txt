Abstract 

The far field asymptotic of internal waves is constructed for the case when a point source of mass moves in a 

layer of arbitrarily stratified fluid with slowly varying bottom. The solutions obtained describe the far field both near the 

wave fronts of each individual mode and away from the wave fronts and are expansions in Airy or Fresnel waves with the 

argument  determined  from  the  solution  of  the  corresponding  eikonal  equation.  The  amplitude  of  the  wave  field  is 

determined  from  the  energy  conservation  law  along  the  ray  tube.  For  model  distributions  of  the  bottom  shape  and  the 

stratification describing the typical pattern of the ocean shelf exact analytic expressions are obtained for the rays, and the 

properties of the phase structure of the wave field are analyzed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

INTRODUCTION 

1

The propagation of internal gravity waves in stratified natural media (ocean and atmosphere) is affected by the 

horizontal  nonuniformity  of  the  medium.  The  most  characteristic  horizontal  nonuniformities  of  the  real  ocean  include 

variations  of  the  bottom  topography,  nonuniformity  of  the  density  field,  and  variations  of  the  mean  flow.  In  the  present 

paper the propagation of internal gravity waves of arbitrarily stratified fluid in a layer of varying depth is considered. The 

difficulty of this problem consist in the fact that when H=H(x,y) (H- function of bottom shape)   the partial differential 

equations  describing  the  internal  waves  do  not  admit  the  separations  of  variables.  An  exact  analytic  solution  of  this 

problem  can  be  derived,  for  example  by  separation  of  variables,  only  in  the  case  when  the  density  distribution  and  the 

shape of the bottom are described by quite simple model functions [2]. For an arbitrary bottom shape and stratification, it is 

possible to construct only asymptotic representations of the solution in the near and far regions; however, for describing 

the internal wave field between these regions an exact numerical solution of the problem is required [2]. 

If  the  ocean  depth  varies  slowly  as  compared  with  the  characteristic  length  of  the  internal  waves,  which  is 

reasonably true for a real ocean, then the method of geometric optics (WKB method)  can be used for solving the problem 

of internal wave propagation above a varying bottom [1,6]. Using the asymptotic representation of the wave field at large 

distances, from the source [2], we can solve the problem of constructing the uniform asymptotic of the internal waves by a 

modification  of  the  geometric  optics  method,  namely  by  the  "vertical  modes  -  horizontal  rays"  method    which  does  not 

assume that the medium parameters vary slowly with the vertical coordinate[1,3]. In [2] the uniform asymptotic of the far 

field of the internal waves were constructed for the constant depth case, and  it was shown that the far internal waves field 

is a sum of individual modes each of which is enclosed within its own Mach cone, the asymptotic form of each mode near 

the  corresponding  wave  front  being expressed in terms of certain special function - the Airy function and its derivative, 

Fresnel integrals [2,5].  Therefore in investigating the problem of internal gravity waves propagation in a stratified fluid 

with slowly varying bottom must be sought not in the form of usual WKB expansion in harmonic waves but in the form of 

waves  of a special types - Airy and Fresnel waves. In [3] the uniform far field asymptotic were constructed for a source 

moving in a medium with a density ρ ρ=

x y z
( ,

, ),

 and in this case the solution was represented as an expansion in Airy 

In the present paper, the problem of the far field of internal waves excited when a source moves in an arbitrarily 

stratified fluid layer with slowly varying bottom is considered and the uniform asymptotic are found for an isolated mode

fluid with the Brunt-Vaisala frequency N z2 ( ) . It is assumed that the velocity V of the source motion along the x axis is 

greater than the maximum group velocity of the internal waves, that is that the source is moving with supercritical velocity. 

The linearized hydrodynamic system of equations in the Boussinesq approximation gives [2,4]

solution of the problem (1.1)—(1.2) will be sought in the form of a sum of modes, each mode propagating independently

of the Fresnel wave since by of the linearity of the problem it is possible to go over from the vertical

It  is  convenient  to  assign  the  initial  conditions  for  the  system  (2.4)  in  the  three-dimensional  space 

(x,y,t)  on  certain  surface:  t

t= 0 , x

Thus, in the three-dimensional space (x,y,t)  the solution of system (2.4) defines a family of spatial-

moment  of  departure  of  the  ray 

0t   play  the  part  of  ray  coordinates,  and  the  variable  t is  simultaneously  a 

Cartesian and ray coordinates. As distinct from the from the characteristic system for a monochromatic wave [1], 

the  projections  of  the  spatial-time  rays  on  the  plane  (x,y)      define  a  two-parameter  family  of  rays,  which  for 

fixed   0t  goes over into the usual one-parameter family of rays with ray coordinates   t and    l . Nevertheless, 

in what follows we will call the variables  l and   0t  the ray coordinates. As may be seen from (2.4) , along the

For  numerical  analysis  of  internal  wave  phase  structure  we  will  consider  the  following  as  a  model 

example  admitting  analytic  solution  of  the  system  (2.4)  and  at  the  same  time  giving  a  qualitatively  correct 

description  of 

the  bottom

assume 

that 

the  Brunt-Vaisaala 

frequency 

is 

constant, N z

We introduce the coordinate system with  x  axis along the shore  y = 0 . We assume that a point mass source is 

moving from right to left in the negative direction along the  x  axis with the velocity V  at a distance  y 0  from 

the  shore,  and  that  at  any  instant  t   it  radiates  waves  at  all  frequencies  in  the  range  0 <

<ω N   We  will 

consider the First mode. Then for  N z( ) = const  from (2.2) there follows

 along which the frequency ω is

ξ ξ=

)y  satisfying both (2.8) and the condition

= 0 . Therefore, Fresnel wave with a given value of the

dy

phase  S *   has  corresponding  critical  values  in  the  variable  y   bounding  its  region  of  propagation  from  the 

traverse  of  the  source  motion.  From  the  results  presented  it  can  be  seen  that  as  the  phase  S *   increases  the 

region of ray penetration (with respect to  y ) increases. 

Thus,  an  increase  in  the  distance  y   from  the  traverse  of  the  source  motion  leads  in  the  incoming 

wave  field  to  a  decrease  in  the  share  of  the  low-frequency  components,  that  is  the  Fresnel  waves  with  small 

phase  values  (the  group  velocity  decreases  with  increase  in  frequency)  and  with  the  chosen  relation  for  the 

bottom  topography  (the  group  velocity  increases  with  increase  in  the  distance  from  the  shore  y = 0 ),  and  in 

view of this the relatively high-frequency components of the field with a lower group velocity may propagate to 

larger distances  y  from the shore than the low-frequency components.

3. ENERGY CONSERVATION AND AMPLITUDE DETERMINATION 

In order to determine the amplitude A  we substitute (1.3) and (1.4) in (1.1) and (1.2) and equate the 

terms of the order of ε 3 2/

. As a result, using the properties of the Fresnel integral, we obtain

In fact, from the averaged hydrodynamic equations it follows that if the non-perturbed density is a function of

existence  of  steady  flows  will  follow.  However,  as  these  flows  are  slow,  they  can  be  neglected  in  the  first

(
for example, by experiment . Since the medium is not at equilibrium whenρ ρ=

is  not  constant  along  the  ray  tube.  However,  the  system  with  a  source and uneven bottom considered in the 

present  study  is conservative, there is no energy flux from outside, and therefore the law (3.6) is the law of 

wave energy conservation along the ray tube.

4.RAY AND AMPLITUDE SOLUTION STRUCTURE IN A LAYER OF CONSTANT DEPTH 

We will now describe the ray and amplitude structure of the solution for a source moving in a stratified 

fluid layer of constant depth, which will later make it possible to construct the uniform asymptotic of an isolated 

mode.  We  assume  that  a  point  mass  source  moving  in  the  negative  direction  along  the x axis  at  the  velocity 

V passes  through  the  coordinate  origin  at  the  time  t = 0 .  At  each  instant  the  source  radiates  waves  at  all 

frequencies  in  the  range  0 <

<ω

max N z( ) .  The  frequency  ω  is  constant  on  a  ray  directed  along  the 

z

vector  k ( , )p q , where

Next we write the equations of the rays. In doing so, it is convenient to use the frequency ω  and the 

instant  t 0  a ray leaves the source as the ray coordinates. In the case under consideration  (

H x y = const )

 is a certain function which is determined by the particular form of the problem in question and 

can be found using the solution of the problem of the motion of a point mass source in a stratified fluid layer of 

constant depth. To do this, we use the localization principle, that is we will assume that at typical distances at 

which the uniform asymptotic (4.3) hold true in a layer of constant depth (of the order of several times the layer 

thickness [2]) the bottom depth can be assumed to be locally constant. Therefore, at these distances the stratified 

fluid  layer  has  a  locally-constant  depth.  In  this  case  the  function  on  the  right  side  of  (5.1)  can  be  calculated 

assuming the depth to be locally constant and using frozen horizontal parameters. 

At the time  t

t= 0  let the moving source be at the point x

0

,

y

0

,

z

. Then, by using (4.2) and (4.4), it 

is possible to obtain

As a result, for a source moving in a stratified fluid layer with slowly varying bottom the first term of 

the uniform asymptotic of the elevation of the Fresnel wave has the form

Therefore, the solution obtained describes in very general form the uniform asymptotic of the far field 

of the internal gravity waves for a source moving above a slowly varying bottom, since for  H

=

(

,
x y

)

=

const 

this  solution  coincides  with  the  uniform  asymptotic  [2].  For  large  values  of σ* (far  from  the  wave  front),  by 

using  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  the  Fresnel  integrals  for  large  arguments  [5],  it  is  possible  to  obtain  the 

representation of the solution in the form of an expansion in locally-harmonic waves - usual WKB expansion. 

For small values of σ*  the solutions obtained describe the asymptotic of the field in the vicinity of the wave 

front of an isolated mode.

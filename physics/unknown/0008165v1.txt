Abstract

The next generation of radiographic machines based on
induction  accelerators  is  expected  to  generate  multiple,
small diameter x-ray spots of high  intensity.  Experiments
to study the interaction of the electron beam with  plasmas
generated at  the  x-ray converter and at  beamline septa are
being  performed  at  the  Lawrence  Livermore  National
Laboratory (LLNL) using the  6-MeV, 2-kA Experimental
Test Accelerator (ETA) electron beam. The physics  issues
of  concern  can  be  separated  into  two  categories.  The
interaction of subsequent beam pulses  with  the  expanding
plasma plume  generated by  earlier pulses  striking  the  x-
ray  converter  or  a  septum,  and  the  more  subtle  effect
involving  the  extraction of  light  ions  from  a  plasma  by
the head of the  beam pulse.  These light  ions  may  be due
to  contaminants  on  the  surface  of  the  beam  pipe  or
converter, or, for subsequent pulses, in the material of  the
converter. The space charge depression of  the  beam could
accelerate the  light  ions  to  velocities  of  several  mm/ns.
As  the  ions  moved  through  the  body  of  the  incoming
pulse,  the  beam would be pinched resulting  in  a moving
focus prior to the converter and a time varying x-ray spot.
Studies  of  the  beam-generated  plasma  at 
the  x-ray
converter have been previously  reported. In  this  paper we
describe  Faraday  cup  measurements  performed  to  detect
and quantify the  flow  of  backstreaming ions  as  the  ETA
beam pulse impinges on preformed plasma.

1  INTRODUCTION

The  interaction  of  an  intense  electron  beam  with  the
x–ray converter in radiographic machines is  an active area
of  research[1].  A  small,  stable  (constant  diameter  and
position)  electron  beam  spot  size  on  the  converter  is
essential  to  achieving  a  high-quality  radiograph.  Beam
parameters  such  as  emittance  and  energy  variation  have
been considered limiting factors for realizing the  optimum
spot size. However, advancements in  induction accelerator
technology have improved beam quality to  a level  where
the  beam  interaction  with  the  converter  may  be  the
limitation 
radiographic
machines. Two areas of concern are the  emission  of  light
ions  [2]  that  can “backstream”  through  the  beam  due  to
space charge potential,  and interaction between  the  beam
and  the  plasma  generated  by  previous  pulses  during
multiple pulse operation.

for 

Previously  reported  studies  have  described  the  use  of
Faraday cups  to  characterize  the  plasma  plume  generated
by the beam at  the  x-ray converter[3].  We have now  used
Faraday  cups  to  detect  ions  that  are  extracted  from  a
plasma  plume  by  the  electron  beam  and  “backstream”

through  the  beam.  The  studies  reported  below  were
performed  on  the  ETA-II  accelerator  at  LLNL  using  a
6–MeV,  2-kA,  70-ns  electron  beam.  The  plasma  plume
was generated by either a laser or a flashboard.

2  EXPERIMENTAL  LAYOUT

2.1  Faraday  Cups

The Faraday  cups  were  comprised  of  two,  electrically
isolated, concentric cylinders as  illustrated in  Fig.  1.  The
inner cylinder could be biased up  to  1.2  kV  with  respect
to the grounded outer cylinder. The OD was 5  cm  with  an
aperture  of  1.9  cm.  The  low  ratio  of  aperture  to  cup
length was to  minimize  the  escape of  secondary electrons
generated  by  the  impact  of  the  positive  ions  with  the
inner cylinder. As shown in Fig. 2, the cups  were situated
at  the  entrance  of  a  solenoid  operating  with  an  on-axis
peak field of approximately 5 kG.

The inner cup discharged to  ground  through  the  50-Ω
input  of  an  oscilloscope,  permitting  the  rate  of  charge
interception (current) to  be  measured.  The  sensitivity  of
the cups to ion density, assuming single ionization, is:

nmin  is  the  minimum  density,  Imin  is

detectable current, A is the  aperture area, and v  is  the  ion
velocity. For a nominal v of 2 mm/ns,  nmin  is  2x105 cm-3
(Imin was 80 µA).

2.2  Target Chamber

The x-ray converter was comprised of  a rotating  wheel
that held several “targets” to  permit  multiple  shots  before
the  x-ray  converter  had  to  be  replaced.  The  majority  of
data was taken for tantalum targets of  three thicknesses: 1
mm,  0.25  mm,  and 0.127  mm.  A  series  of  experiments
were also  performed wherein a thin  foil  was  placed  from
5 mm  to  15  mm  in  front  of  the  target  to  prevent  ions
produced at the  target from backstreaming into  the  beam.
Two-micron  thick  nitrocellulose  and  five-micron  thick
Mylar foils  were used. For  some  runs,  Al  was  sputtered
onto the Mylar film to produce a conducting surface.

Figure  2:  Schematic  showing  relative  positions  of  the
faraday cups with respect to the beam line and target.

Two different target chambers were used. The principal
differences between their configurations were the  location
of  the  focusing  solenoid  with  respect  to  the  target,  the
angle  of  the  viewing  ports  with  respect  to  axis,  and
number of  ports  (six  or  eight)  that  contained the  Faraday
cups.  The  cups  were  located  about  25  cm  from  the
beam/target  intersection  for  both  configurations.  In  the
first  configuration the  cups were at  an angle of  30° from
the beam axis and located partially under the solenoid. The
second configuration reduced the angle to 20° and the  cups
were just outside the solenoid entrance. Data shown below
are for two  cups  located approximately on  opposite  sides
of the beamline; cup #1  was towards the  bottom  and cup
#2 was at the top.

The actual chambers did not have the  perfect cylindrical
symmetry  shown  in  Figure  2.  Various  diagnostics  and
access ports  were located around the  chambers.  However,
the  largest  deviation  from  the  axial  symmetry  was  the
target wheel. The axis  of  this  wheel  was  located  several
centimeters below the beam axis to avoid being struck and
damaged by the beam. The OD of the wheel extended from
about two cm above the axis to about  7  cm  below.  Some
combination  of  the  physical geometry of  the  system  led
to azimuthal asymmetries in the Faraday cup data.
2.3  Laser and Flashboard

An 0.8J, 10 ns FWHM,   Nd:YAG laser was directed at
the  target  and  timed  to  produce  a  plasma  of  sufficient
density that would simulate target debris such  as  multiple
pulse electron beams might encounter near the  target.  The
pulse  energy given  below is  the  energy  measured  at  the
laser. The energy at the target was approximately half that
value  and  decreased  as  the  window  was  covered  with
debris.

A flashboard was added to  the  experiment to  generate a
"cooler"  plasma  than  was  possible  with  the  laser.  The
flashboard was constructed from semi-rigid coax cable by
cutting  an end so  the  inner  conductor  protruded  about  3
mm. The inner conductor was flattened and covered with  a
graphite solution  (aerodag)  to  enhance  breakdown  to  the

outer conductor. A  5  kV  pulse  was  applied  to  the  cable
producing an arc at  the  tip  that  was  sustained  for  a  few
microseconds. Although relatively simple in construction,
the  flashboard  produced  plasma  plumes  that  were  more
consistent  in  density  and  velocity  than  those  generated
using  the  laser.  The  tip  of  the  flashboard  was  located
about 1.5 cm from the beam/target intersection.

3  RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION

The first  ion  signature  measured  by  the  Faraday  cups
occurred when a 250-mJ laser pulse impacted the converter
about 30 ns prior to beam time. The  output  of  one of  the
cups is shown in Figure 3 superimposed on a signal  when
there  was  no  prebeam  laser  pulse.  The  small  signal
labeled "laser pulse at converter" was due to  UV radiation
(generated by the laser at the converter) knocking electrons
off the  surface  of  the  cup.  The  larger  signal  labeled  "e-
Beam Signal"  is  due  to  beam  electrons  scattered  off  the
converter[4].  Both signals  are detected at  the  Faraday  cup
within  1  ns  of  the  respective  events  and  were  used  as
timing fiduciaries. The large positive signal following  the
beam was caused by ions extracted from the laser produced
plasma  plume.  In  the  30  ns  before  beam  arrival,  this
plume  would  have  expanded  only  a  few  mm  from  the
converter's  surface.  Ions  were  detected  for  experiments
where the laser pulses arrived on  target as  late as midway
through the e-beam pulse.

 The  species and energy of  the  ions  can  be  inferred  if
some assumptions are  made about  the  path  the  ions  took
to the cup, the relative time the  ions  were accelerated into
the e-beam, and the magnitude of the  e-beam space charge
depression. With  a  number  of  qualifications,  we  believe
that  the  ion  signal  was  due  primarily  to  H+  ions  with
energy on  the  order of  100  KeV. An  order  of  magnitude
estimate of the ion density can be made by  assuming  that
the  cup intersected a portion  of  a  uniform  2π-stereradian
distribution of ions expanding from the target.  For  Figure
3,  the  ion  density in  the  vicinity  of  the  target  is  about
1013 cm-3.

Figure  6:  Faraday cup signals  showing  effect of  film  on

Figure  4  shows  Faraday  Cup  signals  when  the  beam
impacted the plasma plume generated by  the  flashboard in
front of  the  target superimposed on  the  baseline  Cup  #2
signal  for  no  flashboard.  The  figure  also  illustrates  the
difference  in  signals  received  at  different  azimuthal
positions.  The flashboard was  fired  about  a  microsecond
before beam arrival to  ensure that  the  plasma  plume  had
reached the  beam/target  intersection.  The  later  arrival  of
the main ion signal infers that  heavier ions  were involved
than for the case shown in Figure 3. For  this  case the  ion
signal could have been caused by  C+ ions  with  energy on
the order of 100 KeV in addition to H+ ions.

A non-conducting, thin  film  was suspended in  front of
the  target to  impede the  flow  of  ions  into  the  beam.  We
did not  believe that  sufficient energy  would  be  deposited
into the film by the  beam to  ionize material. The lack of
ions  generated by  the  beam on  Ta  targets  supported  this
scheme.  However,  as  shown  in  Figure  5,  the  beam
striking  the  film  could generate a  large  ion  signal.  This
occurred sporadically when the  film  was 1.5  cm  in  front
of the  target,  essentially  every time  at  1.0  cm,  and never
at 0.5 cm. A conductive coating on the film  prevented ion
generation.  A  similar  effect  was  noted  on  experiments
performed on the PIVAIR accelerator at CESTA[5].

The film was effective at  blocking  ions  in  some  cases.
Figure  6  shows  the  difference between  film  and  no  film

4  SUMMARY

ions  backstreaming 

The  Faraday  cups  proved  effective  at  detecting  and
identifying 
the  e-beam..
Indications of  these ions  were  also  supported  by  a  time
varying beam spot on target as observed by the  x-ray spot
produced. No ions were detected for the  e-beam impinging
on a metallic target without a preformed plasma.

We investigate the work dissipated during the irreversible unfold-
ing of single molecules by mechanical force, using the simplest
model necessary to represent experimental data. The model con-
sists of two levels (folded and unfolded states) separated by an
intermediate barrier. We compute the probability distribution for
the dissipated work and give analytical expressions for the average
and variance of the distribution. To ﬁrst order, the amount of
dissipated work is directly proportional to the rate of application
of force (the loading rate) and to the relaxation time of the
molecule. The model yields estimates for parameters that charac-
terize the unfolding kinetics under force in agreement with those
obtained in recent experimental results. We obtain a general
equation for the minimum number of repeated experiments
needed to obtain an equilibrium free energy, to within kBT, from
nonequilibrium experiments by using the Jarzynski formula. The
number of irreversible experiments grows exponentially with the
ratio of the average dissipated work, Wdis to kBT.

M anipulation of individual biomolecules has led to new

insights about their stability and their interactions in
biologically relevant processes (1, 2). For example, force is
applied to the ends of a single molecule of DNA to stretch it from
a coil to an extended form, and force is applied to DNA or RNA
hairpins to break base pairs and convert double-stranded regions
into single strands (3–6). These ‘‘pulling experiments’’ are
beginning to provide individual molecular trajectories amenable
to treatment by simple statistical-mechanical models. In these
experiments a new reaction coordinate (the end-to-end distance
of the molecule under tension) can be used to describe the
kinetics of the unfolding process. Recently, the pulling of RNA
hairpins has shown the existence of two-state hopping transitions
under force, and new kinetic effects such as hysteresis cycles,
possible intermediate states, and sensitivity of specific binding
sites to metal ions in solution (7, 8). Most of these experiments
are done in nonequilibrium conditions where the folding-
unfolding molecular relaxation time for the transition is slow
compared with the time scale of the pulling experiment. In these
conditions the unfolding process is irreversible. Although this
nonequilibrium regime could be relevant to in vivo conditions
where unfolding events are carried out by protein machines such
as helicases and ribosomes, information about the thermody-
namics parameters of the unfolding process is highly desirable.
Unfortunately, current experimental limitations (thermal drift
and instrumental stability) may not allow the pulling process to
be slower than the molecular relaxation time. Thus, novel
strategies to obtain the equilibrium parameters of the reaction
from nonequilibrium realizations of the process are needed.

To this end, a remarkable identity was proposed by Jarzynski
(9) that describes how equilibrium free energies (cid:1)G can be
obtained from nonequilibrium experiments by averaging the
exponential of the work W done on the system over the non-
equilibrium trajectories, exp((cid:2)(cid:1)G(cid:2)kBT) (cid:3) exp((cid:2)W(cid:2)kBT). This
identity is related to a previously discovered fluctuation theorem
that quantifies transient violations of the second law of thermo-
dynamics (10, 11). A recent experimental test of this identity

used the mechanical unfolding of a single RNA molecule, P5abc
(8). This study showed that the Jarzynski average of successive
nonequilibrium (irreversible) pulling work trajectories provides
an estimate of the free energy change of the unfolding reaction
within an error of order kBT. Moreover, the study also provides
measurements of the average dissipated work that gives addi-
tional information about the nature of the irreversible compo-
nent of the process.

The purpose of the present article is 2-fold. We want to show
how to obtain useful information about the kinetics of the
unfolding process by studying the mean and the variance of the
work probability distribution over many pulling trajectories. We
also want to illustrate, in the framework of the present model,
what conditions must be satisfied for the Jarzynski average to be
a useful and practical method to estimate, from nonequilibrium
trajectories, equilibrium free energies within an error no larger
than kBT.

Model and Methods
Because our main goal is to provide simple expressions, exper-
imentally accessible, we will analyze the simplest model that
incorporates the minimum required set of parameters necessary
to fit the experimental data. We model an RNA molecule as a
two-level system with an intermediate barrier as depicted in Fig.
1. The two-level system corresponds to the energies of the folded
and unfolded molecule, Ef,Eu, separated by an intermediate
energy barrier of height B. The unfolded state has a constant
length xm longer than the folded state and is thus favored by
increasing force. The force necessary to unfold the hairpin in a
reversible process if (cid:1)E0
(cid:2)xm,
where xm is the distance between the folded and the unfolded
hairpin, along the reaction coordinate. Two-level systems are
good approximations for small DNA (12) or RNA (13) hairpins,
known to display strong unfolding-refolding cooperativity.

(cid:2)kBT (cid:4)(cid:4) 1 is approximately Ft

(cid:3) (cid:1)E0

At constant temperature and pressure, the differential change
in Gibbs free energy, dG, of a system when force is applied is
equal to the differential reversible work, Fdx. However for our
two-state system with the unfolded state of constant length, xm,
it is convenient for us to define a Legendre transformation, G (cid:2)
Fx, so that the effect of force on the system is an effective work,
(cid:2)xdF. We use a microscopic description of the two-level system
in terms of an integer variable (cid:1), which takes the values 0 or 1
if the molecule is folded or unfolded. In terms of these variables
the free energy change of the two-level system at a given force
F is expressed as (cid:2)Fxm
(cid:1). In a pulling experiment the molecule
starts in a folded state and the force is progressively increased
from zero up to a maximum force Fm. Different dynamical
trajectories are then generated by pulling many times the same
type of molecule according to the same protocol. Our main goal
is to evaluate the probability distribution function for all of the
possible values of work done.

state (cid:1)
j at the preceding time j. The initial state is P0((cid:1)
0). The
probabilities depend on the rates for a transition from the folded
to unfolded state and vice versa. The transition rates in the
presence of force (17) are given by kf3u(F) (cid:3) kmk0exp((cid:2)(cid:5)(B (cid:2)
F(cid:1)xf3u)), ku3f(F) (cid:3) kmk0exp((cid:2)(cid:5)(B (cid:2) (cid:1)E0

1(cid:2)kBT, where k0 is an attempt frequency and km represents the
contributions from the experimental design (for instance, bead
and handle fluctuations in the optical tweezers machine). The
intermediate barrier is located at distances (cid:1)xf3u, (cid:1)xu3f
(cid:2)
(cid:1)xf3u from the folded and the unfolded states, respectively.
Because the molecule stays in contact with a thermal bath the
rate constants kf3u, ku3f satisfy detailed balance, kf3u(F)(cid:2)

general, here we apply it to an unfolding pathway in which the
unfolding transition under force is basically a first-order passage
process (18, 19). For this reason in Fig. 1 we only represent the
unfolding pathway. The conditional probabilities are: pj(0,1) (cid:3)

and the initial condition vM(cid:10)1
cannot be solved exactly, but most of the information about the
probability distribution can be obtained for the case where the
free energy change of the reaction, (cid:1)G0, is much bigger than kBT,
which is the case we are mostly concerned with (typical unfolding
free energies are many tens of kBT). For this case, the moments
of the distribution P(W) can be evaluated by applying the saddle
point method (method of steepest descents) and solving the
resulting equations by a standard perturbative expansion in
powers of (cid:8). Although our result is general and valid for any
initial state, we are interested in the case where the initial state
P0((cid:1)
0) is in equilibrium at temperature T. We skip mathematical
details and quote only the final result that is obtained after
taking the continuum time limit. The first two cumulants of the
distribution are

The two-state model with an intermediate barrier. The parameters
are: the energy gap (cid:1)E0, the unfolding distance xm, the intermediate barrier
height B, and the distance (cid:1)xf3u of the intermediate barrier to the folded state
(and (cid:1)xu3f (cid:3) xm (cid:2) (cid:1)xf3u).

For the sake of simplicity we have chosen to discretize the time
in integer steps k separated by an elementary time step t0.
Although continuous-time stochastic approaches are possible
(14), our choice results in an easier procedure to carry out the
path integral. The pulling protocol is described by the time
evolution of the force {Fk; 1 (cid:2) k (cid:2) M}, where M is the total
(cid:3) Fm. A dynamical path is

described by the sequence {(cid:1)

continuum limit we take M 3 (cid:5) at the end of the calculation. The

of dissipating it. It is our purpose here to investigate those
deviations around the average behavior and in particular those
rare deviations that are responsible for the validity of the
Jarzynski (9) relation exp((cid:2)(cid:5)Wdis) (cid:3) 1 in the limit of infinite
number of pulls. The probability distribution we want to evalu-

ku3f (F) stands for the total (folding and unfolding) rate. The
term r(F) is the force loading rate applied to the molecule in
units of force(cid:2)time. In the most general case this rate depends
on the pulling speed v and stiffness kF of the transducer (optical
trap, cantilever, etc.) and the compliance (cid:10)L(F)(cid:2)(cid:10)F of the

(cid:2)c(F) with c(F) (cid:3) 1 (cid:10) kF

We can understand the physical meaning of Eq. 5 as follows.
The dynamical paths in a first-time passage process can be
classified in two sets: those in which the unfolding occurs at
forces F (cid:4) Ft (i.e., those that dissipate heat into the bath Wdis
(cid:4)
0) and those that unfold before at F (cid:11) Ft (i.e., those in which heat
(cid:11) 0). Each
from the bath is transformed into useful work, Wdis
unfolding at an intermediate force F(cid:15) contributes an amount of
(cid:10)b(F(cid:15))(cid:2)(cid:10)F(cid:15) to the dissipated work in 5. It can easily be seen that
all those paths with F (cid:4) Ft increase dissipation whereas the ones
with F (cid:11) Ft yield a negative contribution. The memory kernel
g(F, F(cid:15)) is related to the probability that unfolding occurs
between F(cid:15) and F.

(cid:4)(cid:4) 1 and (cid:1)E0

Eqs. 5–8 can be solved exactly numerically to obtain the
moments of the distribution of dissipated work for any loading
rate. We can also obtain explicit equations for the limit of small
(cid:3) (cid:1)G0 we can approximate
loading rates. As (cid:5)(cid:1)E0

where folding and unfolding rates coincide ku3f (Ft) (cid:3) kf3u(Ft),
therefore at that force both states are observed with the same
frequency. In the slow pulling limit r 3 0 all integrals in 5 and
6 can be evaluated, yielding

where (cid:13) is a dimensionless pulling rate. The linear dependence
of Wdis with (cid:13)defines the linear response (LR) regime. Thus, the
average dissipated work for low force-loading rates is directly
proportional to the pulling rate and the reversible free energy
change (cid:1)G0. It is inversely proportional to the product of the
transition force Ft and the total transition rate at the critical
force, which is a measure of the inverse of the relaxation time
of the molecular system at that force. Therefore, a plot of
the average dissipated work for different pulling rates gives
a measure of the fold-unfold relaxation time (at force Ft):
relax(Ft) (cid:3) (kt(Ft))(cid:2)1.

Kinetics from the Average Moments of the Dissipated Work
We now compare the prediction of this model with the main
experimental results. Liphardt et al. (8) have measured the
probability distribution of dissipated work for an RNA molecule,
P5abc, in aqueous solution. The kinetics of this molecule was
studied (7), although extraction of kinetic information proved
(cid:8) 10 pN the molecule was found to oscillate or
difficult. At Ft
‘‘hop’’ between the folded and unfolded configurations at an
approximate rate of 10 Hz. Although P5abc does not exactly
behave like a two-state state system§§ our approach should be
able to capture the kinetics of the rate-determining step [i.e., the
one with smallest kt(Ft)], because this is the one expected to
contribute the most to the dissipated work. Actually, in ref. 8 it
(cid:8) 10 pN and
is shown that the slowest process occurs at Ft

corresponds to a jump xm
kBT.¶¶ In Fig. 2 we show the average dissipated work calculated
for the best-fitting kinetic parameters. The curve was obtained
by numerical evaluation of the integral, Eq. 5, and fitting the
experimental results of ref. 8 at two loading rates for the largest
distance z (cid:3) 35 nm (two points in Fig. 2). The two kinetic
parameters, kt(Ft) and (cid:1)xf3u, were varied to give the best fit for
a given value of (cid:1)G0, and Ft
(cid:3) 10 pN, T (cid:3) 298 K. A set of curves
that fit the experimental data reasonably well for different values

parameters: (cid:1)xf3u

(compatible with ref. 7). This set of values obtained by analyzing
the average dissipated work yields a set of kinetic parameters
consistent with the experimental ones. Furthermore, Fig. 2

‡‡In what follows we assume that all our estimates for the kinetic parameters include the
response of the machine (bead plus handles) so they are effective kinetic parameters, our
main goal being to compare our calculated results with their corresponding experimental
estimates (which are also effective parameters).

§§Pulling curves hint at the existence of another intermediate state at forces around 14 pN

(see refs. 7 and 8).

¶¶In ref. 8 it is estimated (cid:1)G0 (cid:3) 60 kBT for the total reversible work in the pulling
experiment, but around half of the difference with the free energy of the slowest contact
is due to handle contributions.

estimates give very good estimates for the dissipated work at the
maximum force, only the Jarzynski average gives a good estimate
over the whole range of forces. It reproduces the free energy
landscape along the entire pulling coordinate. The fact that the
FD estimate works well at the maximum force is not surprising,
after all R (cid:8) 1 as shown in Fig. 5). Comparing the experimental
results of ref. 8, we observe that the FD estimate first increases
with force, then reaches a maximum and decreases again. The
value of the force corresponding to the position of the maximum
dissipated work increases with the pulling rate as expected (18,
19). Interestingly, as in the experiment, the Jarzynski estimate

clearly shows that the pulling experiments of ref. 8 were not done
in the LR regime (shown by the dashed line).

Let us consider now the information contained in the variance
of the distribution (8) and the fluctuation-dissipation (FD) ratio
R, defined by the expression,

,

R (cid:3)

[10]

where the denominator is the magnitude of the mean-quadratic
fluctuation of the dissipated work as predicted by the FD
theorem (20). Thus, R (cid:3) 1 in the LR regime and deviates as we
depart from that regime. In Fig. 2 Right we plot the value of R
for different pulling rates. Comparison of this quantity with the
results in ref. 8 is difficult because of the large systematic
experimental errors in the SD. However, experimental results
are compatible with a value of R in the neighborhood of 1 and
compatible with the prediction shown in Fig. 2 Right. Note that
although R is close to 1 in the whole range 1 to 100 pN(cid:2)sec, its
behavior is highly nonmonotonic, confirming that the pulling
rates 34(cid:2)52 pN(cid:2)sec in ref. 8 drive the molecule far from
equilibrium. This proves that, although in the LR regime R (cid:8) 1,
the contrary is not necessarily true. Therefore the value of R is
not necessarily a good criteria to establish the LR regime.
Comparison of the work distributions between the experimental
results and the theory yields a remarkable similarity. Because the
whole distribution (2) is difficult to compute analytically we have
carried out numerical simulation pulling experiments using our
model. The results are shown in Fig. 3 where we have checked
that the first two cumulants of the expansion (5, 6) (shown in Fig.
2) exactly match the numerical results. Note that also the
nonsymmetric shape of the distributions for 34 and 52 pN(cid:2)sec is
an indication that the pulling rates are far from the LR regime.

Jarzynski Relation
What about the applicability of the Jarzynski relation (9)?
By performing numerical pulling experiments we have investi-
JE (cid:3)
gated the convergence of
(cid:2)kBT log(exp((cid:2)(cid:5)Wdis)) and compared it with the two possible
estimates obtained from the first and second moments of the
distribution. These are the average dissipated work Wdis and the
FD (cid:3) Wdis(1 (cid:2) R), where R is given in Eq. 10.

be used to recover the shape of the free energy landscape (21).
How many pulls are needed to determine free energy within
kBT? The answer to this question is as follows. Consider the work
distribution P(W) and the variance (cid:1)(cid:2)

(cid:2) 0 that violate the second law and define the
jectories with Wdis
restricted ratio R(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:1)(cid:2)

times in the experiment. Because the largest contribution in this
integral is peaked around the saddle point Wdis* (cid:3) (1 (cid:2) 2R(cid:2))Wdis

the probability that a finite number of trajectories fall in the

where Erfc(x) (cid:3) (2(cid:2)(cid:22)(cid:9))(cid:21)
exp((cid:2)t2)dt is the complementary
error function. In Fig. 5 we show the number of pulls needed to
estimate the free energy within kBT at five pulling rates calcu-
lated from computer simulation of our simple model. The points
are fit to the theoretical expression, Eq. 11, with R(cid:2) as the only
parameter. We note good agreement between the computer
simulations and Eq. 11. For an average dissipated work of less
than 4 kBT, fewer than 100 experiments must be done to obtain
a free energy from Jarzynski’s equation. However, as the average
dissipated work rises past 5 kBT, more than 1,000 experiments
are needed.

Conclusions
We have described a method to analyze dissipation of work
during the unfolding by mechanical force of molecules that can
be approximated as two-state systems. We have shown how the
average dissipated work is proportional to the pulling rate in the
LR regime, the constant being proportional to folding-unfolding
reversible energy associated to the slowest kinetic contacts and
inversely proportional to the folding-unfolding rate at the critical
force. Beyond the LR regime the present approach gives esti-
mates for the kinetic coefficients of such a two-state system from
nonequilibrium experiments. This represents a practical advan-
tage if the folding-unfolding relaxation time is so large that the
pulling process cannot be done reversibly. Furthermore, because
dissipated work gets contribution only from the slowest kinetic
processes, the present approach provides an indirect way to
recognize and isolate specific binding contacts in large molecules
and estimate their free energy. Finally, we have confirmed that
it is possible to use Jarzynski’s identity to obtain good estimates
(within kBT) for equilibrium free energies by averaging over a
number of pulls that asymptotically grows exponentially with the
average dissipated work relative to kBT, Eq. 11. This formula is
general: the only system dependence is expected to enter
through the constant R(cid:2) that is generally of order 1.

Notice that only in the nanoscale is the Jarzynski identity
(cid:2)kBT is typically much larger than
useful. Beyond that scale Wdis
1 (e.g., of the order of the Avogadro number in a macroscopic
system), so the number of trajectories needed to adequately
sample the tails of the distribution is too large to be realizable.
Equivalently, one could say that time scales of order of the
Poincare recurrent time are needed to find some of those rare
trajectories that validate the Jarzynski identity. It would be
interesting to extend this analysis to the case of more complex
molecules with intermediate states and more complex unfolding
pathways such as multidomain proteins and RNAs.

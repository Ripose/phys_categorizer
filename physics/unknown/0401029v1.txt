INTRODUCTION 

The  maximum  luminosity  at  the  Φ-energy  has  been 
reached  in  DAΦNE,  the  Frascati  Φ-factory,  with  values 
near  1032  cm-2sec-1.  The  super-factory  regime,  with  two 
order of magnitude higher luminosities, cannot be reached 
by a simple upgrade of the collider based on stressing the 
present parameters. 

Keeping  the  DAΦNE  main  characteristics  (double 
symmetric  ring  collider  in  multibunch  configuration  and 
flat beams) the design of the super Φ-factory, DAΦNE-II, 
includes  the  innovative  strong  RF  focusing  principle[1] 
with 
and  negative 
radiation  damping 
momentum  compaction.  Many  contributions  to  this 
workshop describe different aspects of the design[2]. 

enhanced 

This paper presents the general characteristics of a ring 
whose  lattice  fulfills  all  these  conditions,  and  whose 
layout fits the existing DAΦNE hall (see Fig.1). 

The  damping  decrements  in  terms  of  the  synchrotron 
radiation  integrals  In  (see  Appendix)  exhibit  strong 
dependence on the energy E:

with Cα = 2113.1m2/GeV3/s and C the ring circumference. 
Presently at DAΦNE the horizontal damping time is of 
the  order  of  105  turns  (35msec),  with  almost  equal 
contributions  coming  from  the  dipoles  (whose  bending 
radius is ρ = 1.4 m) and from the wigglers (ρ = 0.94 m). 
Since  I4  is  negligible  with  respect  to  I2,  the  longitudinal 
damping time is half the horizontal one. 

According  to  beam-beam  simulations[8],  beam-beam 
tune shifts higher than the present limit can be obtained at 
the  Φ-energy  only  if  damping  times  are  lowered  to  few  
milliseconds,  for  the  typical  ring  length  of  100  m;  with 
respect  to  the  DAΦNE  design  values,  a  factor  2  on  the 
beam-beam tune shift corresponds roughly to a factor 10 
on the damping time. For a 100 m long isomagnetic ring 
and  neglecting  the  contribution  of  I4,  the  damping  time 
depends on the total length of dipoles or wigglers, Lmag:

High radiation damping 

Experience  in  all  lepton  factories  demonstrates  the 
importance of radiation emission and short damping time 
in  obtaining  high  beam-beam  tune  shifts.  All  the  low 
energy  rings  for  lepton  collisions  are  equipped  with 
wigglers to increase the radiation: DAΦNE[3], the LERs 
of both B-factories[4][5],CESR-c[6], VEPP2M[7].

This expression is reported in Fig.2 for different values 
of  the  magnetic  field,  including  the  superconducting 
option at 4 T: damping times shorter than 10 msec can be 
obtained  only  if  a  large  part  of  the  ring  is  filled  with 
magnets or wigglers, leading to an All-Wiggler-Machine, 
a  concept  which  was  first  introduced  years  ago  as  a 
possible solution for synchrotron radiation facilities[9]. A 
high  luminosity  collider  must  be  based  on  a  similar 
solution. 

of  the  bending  angle,  and  therefore  each  dipole  focuses 
almost equally in the horizontal and vertical planes. 

The dispersion self solution η inside the dipoles has the 
sign  opposite  to  the  bending  radius'  one,  so  that  the 
contribution  to  the  momentum  compaction  is  negative 
from all the dipoles. The maximum of the absolute value 
of  the dispersion  function occurs inside the magnets and 
therefore the cell longitudinal phase advance, represented 
by the term R56 of the first order transport matrix, is high.

are  described  in  a  contribution  to  this  workshop[10]. 
The  shorter  bunch 
regular 
length  and 
longitudinal  distribution  in  a  lattice  with  negative αc  are 
beneficial to the luminosity while the longitudinal beam-
beam  effect  is  counteracted  by  the  slope  of  the  RF 
voltage. All present storage rings work in the positive αc 
regime;  in  some  of  them,  with  enough  flexibility  in  the 
lattice,  experiments  have  been  done,  setting  the machine 
to  a  negative  momentum  compaction  configuration. 
Results  confirm  simulations:  bunch  lengths  shorter  than 
those  corresponding  to  positive  momentum  compaction 
have been obtained[11]. 

The DAΦNE-II design is based on negative αc. 

Strong RF focusing 

In the flat beam regime the bunch length at the IP must 
be  of  the  order  of  the  vertical  betatron  function,  i.e.  few 
millimiters  for  the  very  high  luminosities.  Such  short 
bunches  cannot  be  obtained  in  the  low  energy  rings 
because  of  the  microwave  instability  lengthening.  The 
modulation of the bunch length along the ring introduced 
with  the  strong  RF  focusing[1][12]  yields  very  short 
bunches  at  the  IP  while  mantaining  the  average  bunch 
length  above  the  microwave  threshold  instability,  if  the 
impedance  sources  are  concentrated  in  the  high  bunch 
length  region.  High  RF  voltage  and  strong  correlation 
between  longitudinal  position  in  the  bunch  and  energy 
deviation  produce  the  high  synchrotron  phase  advance 
necessary to focus the beam longitudinally. 

 

 

 

LATTICE CELL 

A magnetic lattice has been designed based on the three 
above  principles:  high  radiation  damping,  negative 
momentum compaction, large longitudinal phase advance.  
The  arc  structure  is  based  on  cells  with  negative  and 
positive  bending  magnets[13].  Figure  3  shows  the  cell 
layout and fig.4 the betatron functions and the dispersion. 
In the dipoles the wedge angles correspond to one fourth

 Figure 3 - Schematic cell layout 
 

 

Figure 4 - Cell betatron functions and dispersion 

 
In  such  a  cell  the  betatron  functions  are  naturally 
splitted between the dipoles, and chromaticity is corrected 
by  sextupoles  placed  there,  all  with  the  same  field 
orientation,  acting  alternatively  on  the  vertical  plane  in 
the negative dispersion region and on the horizontal plane 
in the positive one.   

The most effective parameter for tuning the momentum 
compaction  is  the  distance  between  the  positive  and  the 
negative dipoles, since it changes the maximum values of 
the self solution of the dispersion function. By tuning the 
quadrupole  settings,  the  momentum  compaction  can  still 
be  modified  by  an  amount  of  the  order  of  10%  without 
changing  significantly  the  transverse  betatron  functions. 
The  phase  advance  per  cell  is  similar  in  the  two  planes, 
and can also be tuned to set the whole ring working point. 

STORAGE RING 

The minimum bunch length along the ring occurs at the 
position  where  the  longitudinal  phase  advance  measured 
from  the  rf  cavity  is  half  the  total  one[1]:  the  R56  term 
between the cavity position and the IP must be the same 
on both sides of the ring. The ring layout is similar to the 
DAΦNE  one,  with  a  shorter  inner  arc  consisting  of  five 
cells  and  a  longer  outer  of  six  (see  Fig.1).  All  the  cells 
have the same dipoles and the same bending angle, while 
the drift lengths and the quadrupole settings are different 
in the long and short part in order to fulfill the condition:

Dispersion  suppressors  (DS's)  are  placed  at  the  arc 
ends. They are based on one dipole with the same bending 
radius  of  the  cell  dipoles  and  a  quadrupole  doublet  to 
match  dispersion  and  R56  tunability  in  the  arcs.  An 
example  of  the  DS  region  between  the  short  arc  and  the 
IR  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.  The  other  three  DS's  are  similar. 
Matching  between  the  DS  and  the  IR  is  performed  by 
means of a quadrupole triplet.  

The IR design, described in detail in [14], is based on a 
10  m  long  Interaction  Region,  with  two  sets  of  four 
symmetric quadrupoles yielding βx=0.5 m, βy* between 2 
and 4 mm. The Interaction Region is compatible with the 
present KLOE detector with minor modifications.

suppressor near the IR  
 
The  long  section  opposite  to  the  IR  has  space  for

quadrupoles match the adjacent dispersion suppressors. In 
the  second  crossing  point  of  the  rings  the  beams  are 
vertically separated, and so are the vacuum chambers, in 
order to avoid any cross-talk between the two beams.

with ρ =  0.94  m[16].  The  enhancement  factor  FD  =  5.6 
represents the increase of dipole length with respect to a 
ring  with  only  positive  bending  radius,  at  the  same 
magnetic  field.  The  synchrotron  radiation  integrals  are 
given in the  Appendix. The integral I4 is negative and not 
negligible  if  compared  to  I2.  It  influences  strongly  the 
damping  partition  numbers,  and  damping  is  transferred 
from the longitudinal to the horizontal plane, since:

5.7 msec. 

Damping times are therefore: τx = 7.2, τy = 9.6 and τs = 

Another consequence of the large negative value of I4 is 
that the natural energy spread is increased: its expression 
in terms of the synchrotron radiation integrals is given by: 

 

 

 

 

where Cq = 3.8319.10-13 m. Since the energy spread in the 
presence  of  SRFF  is  higher  than  the  natural  one,  this  is 
one of the crucial parameters of the design.  

The  total  energy  loss  per  turn  is  35  keV  and  the 

horizontal emittance is 0.3 mm mrad.  

The RF frequency for the ring is near 500 MHz, which 
is  a  good  compromise  between  the  energy  acceptance 
requirements and the required voltage level[12]. 

The  lattice  as  described  so  far  can  work  in  a  low  RF 
focusing  regime,  with  a  voltage  of  the  order  of  few 
hundreds  of  kV  and  the  corresponding  bunch  length, 
almost constant along the ring, is of the order of 2 cm for 
250 kV with a longitudinal phase advance of ~16º. 

By  increasing  the  RF  voltage  we  switch  to  the  strong 
RF  focusing  regime.  Its  complete  treatment  is  described 
in  [1].  The  main  parameters  are  here  reported.  The 
longitudinal phase advance is given by:

LUMINOSITY 

APPENDIX  

 

The  single  bunch  luminosity  parameters  are  listed  in 
table I. The main difference in luminosity with respect to 
the  present  DAΦNE  values  comes  from  the  smaller 
vertical betatron function, almost by a factor 10, thanks to 
the  bunch  length  reduction  by  the  same  order  of 
magnitude.  The  bunch  current  is  of  the  order  of  20  mA, 
similar 
luminosity 
improvement comes from the smaller emittance and from 
the  lower  beam-beam  blow-up  due  to  the  stronger 
radiation damping. The higher RF frequency shortens the 
bunch  spacing  to  1.8  nsec,  and  increases  the  collision 
frequency.  Expected  beam-beam  tune  shifts,  neglecting 
the crossing angle effect, are:

DYNAMIC APERTURE 
The  dynamic  aperture  of    the  ring  is  very  large  on 
energy  and  off-energy  without  synchrotron  oscillations. 
Sextupoles are naturally placed in the best position for the 
chromaticity correction. The structure is not critical at low 
synchrotron tune as well. 

On the other hand the preliminary 6-D tracking shows a 
very strong correlation between the dynamic aperture and 
the working point in the three phase space planes [17]. In 
the  strong  RF  focusing  regime  the  dynamic  aperture  is 
reduced  as  compared  to  the  weak  focusing  case  or 
constant  energy deviation. A  possible mechanism of this 
reduction 
the  synchrotron  motion  produces 
satellites  of  the  strong  sextupole  resonances  and  reduces 
the stable area.  

that 

is 

The  dependence  of  the  dynamic  aperture  on  the  tune 

point in three dimensions has to be explored.  
 

CONCLUSIONS 
A ring lattice based on the strong RF focusing principle 
has  been  designed.  The  conditions  of  high  radiation 
damping  and  negative  momentum  compaction  are  also 
fulfilled.  

The ring layout fits the existing DAΦNE hall, and the 
existing KLOE detector with minor modifications for this 
one.  

A  first  set  of  parameters  fulfilling  the  requirement  of 
luminosity in the order of 1034 cm-2sec-1 has been defined. 
The  criticality  of  each  parameter  must  be  weighted  in 
order to optimize the overall reliability of the complex. 

 

Synchrotron radiation integrals 

 
The  lattice  of  the  DAΦNE-II  ring  has  been  calculated 
with  the  MAD8  code  [18].  The  synchrotron  radiation 
integrals  are  one  ot  the  MAD8  outputs.  They  have  also 
been evaluated indipendently and a discrepancy has been 
found in the calculation of the synchrotron integral I4. For 
rings  with  achromatic  cells  and  small  momentum 
compaction the value of I4 is negligible with respect to I2 
and so are its contributions to the value of emittance and 
energy  spread.  This  is  not  the  case  in  the  DAΦNE-II 
lattice. Here we assume that the.contribution to I4 by each 
dipole  for  an  isomagnetic  ring  is  given  by  the  definition 
of [19]:

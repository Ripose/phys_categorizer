1. Introduction

Finite Element (FE) analysis is a widely used method in the field of biomechanics and

customized   meshes   are   of   great   interest   since   they   can   integrate   both   geometry   and

mechanical   properties   of   the   patient.   Recently,   the  Mesh   Matching   (M-M)   algorithm

(Couteau et al., 2000) was introduced to  automatically  generate customised hexahedron

and  wedge  3D  patient  meshes  from  an  existing  3D  generic  mesh. The  algorithm   was

successfully applied  to proximal  (Couteau  et  al,  2000)  and  entire  (Luboz  et  al,  2001)

femora. However, the application to a more complicated geometry, namely a FE model of

the human face (Chabanas and Payan, 2000), provided non-satisfying mesh irregularities

that made the mechanical analysis impossible.

In   commercial   products,   automatically   meshing   a   3D   structure   generally   uses   the

tetrahedral meshing technique, which is  the  most  common  form  of  unstructured mesh

generation. This technique is frequently based on the Delaunay criterion (Delaunay et al.,

1934) followed by the advancing front technique (Lo, 1991). The advantage of hexahedral

meshes, compared with tetrahedral meshes, is their increased accuracy. Their drawback is

that hexahedral meshing of complicated geometry is difficult (Owen, 1998) and requires a

large amount of manual intervention.

Before numerical computation can be carried out, the manually designed meshes often

need to be corrected, which is also time consuming. Several regularization techniques are

proposed in the literature and are generally adapted to tetrahedral elements. They involve a

reconnection algorithm (Joe, 1995) or a node point adjustment  method (Amezua et al.,

1995). Geometrically correcting a set of elements inside a 3D mesh is a complex problem

without any straightforward solution (Cannan et al., 1993; Freitag and Plassmann, 1999).

Indeed, correcting a single element can distort its neighbours although they were originally

regular. Elements must therefore be considered together for the mesh to be corrected.

The goal of this study is to develop an automatic mesh regularization procedure in order

to achieve the numerical feasibility of the Finite Element Analysis. The method can be

applied to any element type (tetrahedron, hexahedron, wedge). The locations of the nodes

of irregular elements are iteratively corrected using the Jacobian determinant variations.

The   method  is   first   evaluated  on   an  academic  test   case   (cubic   structure  meshed   with

hexahedrons).   The   method   is   then   applied   to   seven   human   faces   to   investigate   the

feasibility of a clinical application. 

2. Materials and Methods

The   patient   mesh   generation   is   obtained   in   two   steps.   First,   the   M-M   algorithm

(Couteau et al., 2000) is applied to a standard model. Then, irregular elements that might

have   been   generated   by  the   M-M   algorithm   are   automatically  regularized.   This   paper

focuses on the second phase and will only briefly describe the M-M algorithm. 

2.1. M-M Algorithm Application

The steps of the M-M algorithm:

1. A FE  model of the structure  is  chosen. This  model  is  often built  from a standard

patient morphology. Its 3D mesh is assumed to be optimal in terms of mesh refinement

and mesh regularity. This model is called the “generic model” since it is used in the M-

M algorithm as a starting point to define other FE meshes of the same anatomical

structure corresponding to other patient morphologies.

2. The external surface of the patient anatomical structure is extracted through CT (or

MRI) acquisition. On each CT (or MRI) slice, the external contour of the structure is

segmented, providing a set of 3D points located on the surface.

3. An elastic registration method, originally proposed in the field of computer-assisted

surgery (Lavallée et al., 1995; 1996), is used to match the extracted patient surface

points with the nodes located on the external surface of the generic FE model. This

matching aims at finding a volumetric transform T, which is a combination of global

(rigid)   and   local   (elastic)   transforms.   The   idea   underlying   the   matching   algorithm

consists (1) in aligning the two datasets (the rigid part of T) and (2) in finding local

cubic   B-Splines   functions   (Szeliski   and   Lavallée,   1996).   The   unknowns   of   the

transform are all the B-Splines parameters. Those parameters are obtained through an

optimization process (the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and a modified conjugate

gradient algorithm) that aims at minimizing the distance between the two surfaces,

namely the points extracted from the patient data and the external nodes of the generic

FE model.

4. The volumetric transform  T  is then applied  to every node of the FE generic mesh,

namely the nodes located on the external surface as well as the internal nodes that

define   the   FE   volume.   A   new   volumetric   mesh   is   thus   automatically  obtained   by

assembling the transformed nodes into elements, with a topology similar to that of the

generic FE model: same number of elements and same element types.

2.2. Regularization of the Mesh

2.2.1 Regularity Criteria

Before improving the quality of the Finite Element mesh, the regularization

phase   checks   whether   each   element   of   the   mesh   is   regular.   This   regularity  notion   is

associated   with   the  Jacobian   matrix   transform,   coupling   the   reference   element   (unit

reference   framework)   and   the  actual  element   (real   reference   framework)  (Touzot   and

Dhatt, 1984, Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 1994).

Finite Element Analysis is carried out only if the transform can be computed on each

point inside the element, that is to say if the Jacobian determinant value (detJ) is larger

than zero anywhere inside the element. The Jacobian determinant detJ   is computed at

each node of each element. If a negative or nil value is obtained for one of the nodes, the

element is classified as irregular. 

2.2.2 Regularization Algorithm

The   regularization   algorithm   consists   of   an   iterative   process:   nodes   of   irregular

elements   are  slightly  shifted   at   each   step,   until   each  element   becomes   regular.   In  the

following development, the subscript variables are:  k  - irregular element;  i  - node(s) of

element k with nil or negative Jacobian determinant; j - nodes attached to element k; n -

number of nodes of element k.

The regularization procedure consists of two main steps:

- Computation of the Jacobian  determinant (which has no dimension) at each  node of

the mesh and detection of irregular element k (detJi 0). 

- Automatic correction of irregular element  k  using a numerical sensitivity procedure

based on gradient evaluation.

The idea is to iteratively move each node i (where detJi  0) in a direction that tends to

increase the detJi value. As an analytical expression of the gradient vector (detJi)j can be

found. The algorithm consists of moving the node in the direction of the gradient vector in

order to increase detJi.

As expressed in equation (1), the gradient vector (detJi)j (whose dimension is : length-

1) is first computed using actual coordinates Xj(xj, yj, zj) of nodes j attached to the distorted

element k (with a first order Taylor Series). This gradient vector provides an evaluation of

the sensitivity of the geometrical transform (reference framework / actual framework) to

the  nodes  locations.  Analytical   expressions   of     detJi  and  (detJi)j  are derived  using  a

computer algebra system (Maple©).

The directional vector  Vj, expressed by  equation (2), is determined  for updating the

node locations. The dimension of Vj and its Euclidian norm ||Vj|| is length. For a node with

index j, the gradient vectors (1) are summed at the element k level. If n is the number of

nodes of this element k, the gradient vector is computed and summed for each node i (from

1 to n) of the element. Taking into account that only gradient vectors of irregular nodes are

summed,   a   coefficient  i  is   introduced.   The   value   of   this   coefficient   is   1   when   the

determinant of the Jacobian is negative or null at the point i and 0 when detJi  is positive.

The procedure is then repeated for each distorted element and finally, the residual vector is

derived from the summation over  p,  p  being the index of all the elements in the mesh

having the node j in their connectivity.

where i = 1 if  detJi  0 and i = 0 if detJi > 0.

The modification of node locations is based on equation (3) where Xj and X’

j are the old

and the new coordinates of the node  j,  and  w  is a factor depending on the scale of the

structure, taken here as a percentage of the average edge length,  averLength, taking into

account the dimension of the mesh. The directional vector is finally normalized with the

Euclidian norm so that Vj / ||Vj|| has no dimension.

In addition to the algorithm, maximal node displacements are constrained so that the

regularized mesh still fits the patient morphology. The constraints for internal and external

nodes differ but they are both based on a percentage of the displacement of the nodes from

their initial  positions, computed after the M-M algorithm (with a small percentage for

external surface nodes in order to still fit the patient geometry).

3. Results

The   regularization   method   is   first   evaluated   on   the   simple   test   case   presented   in

Figure 1-a. The cubic structure is meshed with hexahedrons  starting from a controlled

irregular mesh, shown in Figure 1-b. To get this distorted mesh, the node located inside

the original cube was manually moved. The minimum Jacobian determinant is - 0.1125,

thus no FE analysis is feasible. The regularization method succeeded, providing a regular

mesh (figure 1-c) with a threshold value of 10-4 for the Jacobian determinant. Increasing

the lower admissible value of the Jacobian determinant in the algorithm also improves the

meshing and allows the convergence towards perfect cubic elements (figure 1-d). 

The following clinical application concerns the automatic mesh generation  of human

faces in orthognatic surgery (Chabanas et al., 2003). The generic model used to run the M-

M algorithm is plotted in  Figure 2a  and the regularized meshing of the new patient is

plotted in Figure 2b. The human face mesh is made of 2884 elements and 4216 nodes and

represents the soft tissues (skin, muscles and fat tissues) as a homogenous material. The

M-M algorithm generates 149 irregular elements that were detected by the procedure. As

an   example,   a   distorted   element   selected   within   the   lips   is   plotted   before   and   after

regularization, in Figure 2c.

It took about one minute and 130 iterations (on a DEC Alpha 500 MHz computer) to

correct the irregular elements. The new mesh remains very close to the one generated by

the   M-M   algorithm   and   no   geometrical   difference   can   be   visually   observed.   More

quantitatively, among the 4216 nodes of the mesh, 614 were finally moved by the iterative

regularization   technique,   with   a   2.2   mm   mean   displacement   value   (maximum

displacement = 2.692 mm; minimum displacement = 0.001 mm).  In this test, the Jacobian

determinant threshold value was 10-9. 

The  regularization method was  successfully applied to  six other  patient FE  models

generated by the M-M  algorithm. Two of  the six regularized meshes are  presented in

Figure 3.  Note that the mesh after regularization is still close to the CT data.  Table 1

summarizes   the   regularization   computation   time,   the   number   of   irregular   nodes,   node

displacements and the number  of  shifted nodes.  For  all the  test  cases,  5%  to  10%  of

irregular elements have been detected and automatically regularized. Despite the obvious

variation in geometries, good results were obtained and the computation time was less

than four minutes.

Recently, the combination of the M-M algorithm and of the regularization phase has

been applied to FE orbit meshes. As for the face, these two processes were required to

generate a great number of meshes from a manually meshed orbit used as an atlas. This

generic mesh is composed of 1375 elements and 6948 nodes and represents the soft tissues

of   the   orbit,   i.e.   the   fat   tissues,   the   muscles   and   the   optic   nerve   as   a   homogeneous

poroelastic material. It has been developed to simulate orbital surgeries and more specially

exophthalmia reduction (Luboz et al., 2004) in a computer assisted diagnosis framework.

Eleven patient-specific meshes were generated with the M-M algorithm. Each mesh had

irregular elements: approximately 158 elements (with a standard deviation of 28). The

regularization phase achieved to correct all of them by moving around 566 nodes (standard

deviation: 99) with a mean displacement of 0.11 mm (standard deviation: 0.03). In this

test,   the   Jacobian   determinant   was   set   to   10-1.   Table   2   summarizes   the  regularization

computation time, the number of irregular nodes, node displacements and the number of

shifted  nodes.  All  irregular   elements   were automatically  regularized by our  algorithm.

Figure 4 plots two patient specific meshes thus generated and regularized. After a mean

regularization   time   of   about   3   min   (standard   deviation:   40   seconds),   each   mesh   was

corrected without any visible change in the geometry of the mesh surface. 

4.  Discussion and conclusion

In  previous   studies,   it   was   demonstrated,   for   simple   anatomical   structures   like   the

femora, that the M-M algorithm is efficient at  automatically generating different patient

meshes   from   an   existing   regular   FE   mesh.  But   some   problems   occurred   when   the

geometry of the modelled anatomical structure became complex. In that case, the meshes

automatically generated by the M-M algorithm were found irregular for a FE analysis. This

paper introduced a new, fully automatic  regularization procedure (based on the Jacobian

determinant) that applies to these kind of irregular meshes. The procedure was illustrated

in a simple test case (cubic mesh) and it was successfully evaluated for the regularization

of seven FE meshes of the human face and eleven FE meshes of the orbit.

The  regularization   algorithm  succeeds  to   automatically  correct  the  irregular   meshes

generated by the M-M method. The patient meshes can then be used to carry out a Finite

Element Analysis (in orthognatic surgery for the face model and in orbitopathy surgery for

the orbit model). 

Nevertheless, one must first notice that this regularization algorithm has been tested on

a mesh that was originally manually designed. This means that the original elements of the

generic mesh, matched to patient data with the M-M algorithm, were designed to be as

regular as possible (with hexahedrons and wedges). In other words, the generated patient

mesh   was   probably   “less   irregular”   than   a   rough   and   unstructured   tetrahedral   mesh

deformed by the M-M algorithm would have been. 

Another limitation  of the method is our inability to guarantee  that the regularization

algorithm  will  correct  any irregular mesh.  Indeed, due to  its  formulation,  the iterative

process of the algorithm tries to find a global solution, without any theoretical guarantee to

converge.   As   can   be   seen   on   tables   1   and   2,   some   mesh   regularizations   need   more

iterations than other ones, but all of them finally converge to a stable solution.

In  the   next   phase,  we   plan   to   deal   with   other  clinical   applications   involving  other

geometrical FE models such as shoulder and liver. Another important perspective is to

include quality criteria for the FE mesh into the iterative regularization algorithm (warping

factor, parallel deviation, aspect ratio, edge angle, skew angle or twist angle).

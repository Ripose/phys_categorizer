Relativistic angle-changes and frequency-changes  
Eric Baird  (eric_baird@compuserve.com) 

We generate a set of "relativistic" predictions for the relationship between viewing angle 
and apparent frequency, for each of three different non-transverse shift equations. We find 
that a detector aimed transversely (in the lab frame) at a moving object should report a 
redshift effect with two out of the three equations. 

 
1.  Introduction 
One of the advantages of Einstein’s special 
theory [1] over other contemporary models was 
that it provided clear and comparatively 
straightforward predictions for angle-changes 
and frequency changes at different angles. 
These calculations could be rather confusing in 
the variety of aether models that were available 
at the time  (see e.g. Lodge, 1894 [2] ). 

In this paper, we derive the relativistic angle-
changes and wavelength-changes that would be 
associated with each of the three main non-
transverse Doppler equations, if used as the 
basis of a relativistic model.  

2.  Geometry 

Wavefront shape 
If a “stationary” observer emits a unidirectional 
pulse of light and watches the progress of the 
spreading wavefront, the signal that they detect 
is not the outgoing wavefront itself, but a 
secondary (incoming) signal generated when 
the outgoing wavefront illuminates dust or 
other objects in the surrounding region.  

 

If we assumed that the speed of light was 
constant in the observer’s own frame, any dust-
particles that the observer saw to be illuminated 
at the same moment would be said to lie on a 
spherical surface, and these  “illumination-
events” would be said to be simultaneous.  

In a different inertial frame, the observer’s 
spatial coordinates change while these light-
signals are in flight. The description of the 
same light-rays and illuminated surfaces now 
involves rays emanating from one spatial 
position, striking dust-particles, and generating 
secondary signals which then converge on a 
different spatial position.  

In the new frame, our original illuminated 
spherical surface now has to obey the condition 
that the round-trip flight-time from 
Aﬁ
surfaceﬁ B is the same for rays sent in any 
direction, and a map of a cross-section through 
the surface now gives us an elongated ellipse, 
with the emission and absorption points being 
the two ellipse foci. 

 

The same set of illumination-events can mark 
out a spherical spatial surface in one frame and 
a spheroidal spatial surface in the other. [3][4] 

Ellipse dimensions  
Instead of using the “fixed flat aether approach” 
for calculating distances in our diagram (setting 
the distance between foci as v and the round-
trip distance as 2c), we will instead construct 
our map around the wavelength-distances that 
must be fitted into it, regardless of whether or 
not these distances are expected to fit nicely 
into flat spacetime.  

The three Doppler formulae used are: 

      freq’ / freq =  (c-v) / c

      freq’ / freq =  c / (c+v) 

)v

 

+

… (1) 

… (2) 

… (3) 

, where v is recession velocity 

Equation (1) is often associated with emitter 
theories, (3) is usually associated with an 
absolute aether stationary in the observer’s 
frame, and (2) is the intermediate prediction 
used by special relativity (and is the root 
product of the other two equations). [5]

3.  Resulting wavefront maps 

Ellipse proportions 

Each of our three Doppler equations (1), (2), 
(3) has the same ratio l 0°: l 180° , so all three 
ellipses share the same proportions and  angles. 
Each ellipse is related to its immediate 
neighbours by a Lorentz magnification or 
reduction. 

Reading information from the 
wavefront map 
Each wavefront map is drawn for a specific 
velocity, and includes the reference-angles and 
wavelengths for a “stationary” object (dashed 
circular outline) and the corresponding angles 
and wavelength distances for the moving object 
(solid ellipse).    

Each ray drawn on our map then has two 
nominal angles (defined by where the ray hits 
the perimeter of each wavefront outline), and 
two nominal wavelengths (defined by the 
distance from the common focus to each 
wavefront outline).  

Thus, for special relativity at v=0.75c (second 
diagram), we can immediately see that a light-
ray aimed at the moving particle at 90° in the 
background frame will strike the front of the 
particle at slightly less than 45° from the  
particle’s path, and will have a  
 

wavelength that is about two thirds of the 
original wavelength.  Conversely, when the 
particle emits a ray that is received at 90° in the 
background frame, we can see that the 
wavelength is magnified about 1½  times, and in 
the particle’s frame was aimed rearwards at 
roughly 45° from the perpendicular.   

Precise calculations are given in section 5.  

4.  Special relativity 

Lorentz contraction 
The elliptical outline of the second map can be 
converted back into a circle of radius c by 
applying a Lorentz contraction in the direction 
of motion.  

 

 

The resulting diagram (above) then shows the 
non-relativistic Nineteenth-Century predictions 
for angle-changes and wavelength changes 
associated with an object moving through a flat 
stationary aether, viewed by a stationary 
observer (Lodge [2], fig 4, pp.739).  

Minkowski diagrams 
We can also obtain special relativity’s elliptical 
wavefront diagram by taking a standard 
Minkowski light-cone diagram, [6] and slicing 
it at an angle parallel with the plane of 
simultaneity of an object in a different frame. 

 
Lorentz transforms can then be used to turn the 
“skewed” lightcone diagram back into the usual 
“unskewed” version.

5.  Resulting formulae  

Angle changes 
All three diagrams produce the same angle-
change relationships presented in Einstein’s 
1905 paper [1] as “the law of aberration in its 
most general form”,  

Labﬁﬁemitter 
If a signal is aimed at the moving object at 90° 
in the lab frame, the wavelength changes seen 
by the object should be:

Wavelength changes at all angles 
The wavelength-changes in rays arriving in the 
laboratory frame, if angle A is measured in the 
lab frame (and v is positive for recession when 
A=0°), are: 

      l ’/l =

… (iii) 

The wavelengths generated by the second 
diagram are those given in section 7 of the 
1905 electrodynamics paper.  Wavelengths 
generated by (1) and (3) are simply special 
relativity’s values, multiplied or divided by a  
Lorentz term.  

6.   “Transverse” shift 
predictions  
Emitterﬁﬁlab 
If we aim a detector transversely at a moving 
object (with our “ninety degrees” being 
measured in the detector’s frame), the predicted 
wavelength changes seen by the detector are:  

        freq’/freq = 1 – v²/c²       

        freq’/freq = 

v-

2

2 /

c

     

        freq’/freq = 1       

… (i) 

… (ii) 

… (iii) 

As with the non-transverse predictions (1), (2), 
(3), special relativity’s “transverse” predictions 
for observed frequencies and apparent ruler-
changes are the root product average of the 
“non-relativistic” predictions made by 
assuming a fixed speed of light in each frame.   

        freq’/freq = 1 / (1 – v²/c²) 

… (iii) 

These predictions differ from the earlier set 
because of our asymmetrical decision to 
measure all angles in the laboratory frame. 

7.  Round-trip shift predictions 

… transverse  
If we aim a signal at a moving transponder and 
catch the retransmitted signal, then if both 
signals paths are transverse to the transponder 
path in the laboratory frame, multiplying the 
two previous sets of results together gives us 
final round-trip predictions of:  

        freq’/freq = 1 – v²/c²       

        freq’/freq = 1       

… (i) 

… (ii) 

        freq’/freq = 1/ (1 – v²/c²)        … (iii) 

Equation (1) predicts a Lorentz-squared 
redshift after two lab-transverse frame 
transitions, and special relativity gives a null 
result.  

… non-transverse 
We could also aim our source and detector at 
the transponder non-transversely. Multiplying 
the approach and recession shifts gives:

These round-trip frequency shifts are the same 
as in the previous “transverse” calculation.

… at any angle 
If we mount our detector and signal source on a 
turntable, the angle that the sourceﬁ
detector 
line makes with the transponder path has no 
effect on the final calculated round-trip shift.  

If we aim two lasers collinearly into an ion 
beam, and measure the non-transverse 
frequency shifts by measuring how far the 
lasers need to be detuned in order to achieve 
resonance in the beam, [7] the relationship 
between the product of the shifted frequencies 
and the original frequency should be unaffected 
by any misalignment of the lasers or spread of 
observation angles, [8] provided that the 
angular error is the same for both observations. 

8.  Consequences  
Generality of the E=mc 2 result 
In a previous paper [9] we showed that the 
E=mc2 mass-energy relationship can be derived 
from the frame-dependent total momentum of 
two plane waves emitted directly forwards and 
backwards along the direction of motion, if the 
non-transverse shift law is (1), with the 
equivalent calculation using (2) giving   
E=mc2 / (cid:214) ( 1 – v2/c2). Einstein’s 1905 “inertia” 
paper [10] gives a more general calculation for 
an opposing pair of plane waves tilted at any 
angle in the emitter-frame. 

Since the angle-dependent information needed 
to calculate the momentum components of 
light-rays in the first two elliptical maps differs 
only by a Lorentz scaling, the angle-
independence of the 1905 derivation also 
applies to our “emitter-theory” derivation. 

Reworking special relativity 
Ellipse 3(ii) contains the same key relationships 
as special relativity, but without explicitly 
using the special theory’s assumption of flat 
spacetime, or by dividing the phenomena into 
separate “propagation” and “Lorentz” 
components.  

It is possible that other researchers may be 
interested in examining a class of model in 
which local lightspeed constancy is regulated 
by spacetime distortions associated with the 
relative motion of physical particles (e.g. [11]), 
but which generates the same basic shift 
predictions as special theory.  

We do not expect to see a theory based on 
3(iii). 

9.  Conclusions 
The wavefront maps presented in section 3 can 
be useful as a visualisation aid for relativistic 
problems.  

Investigating the properties of these maps 
raised three additional points:   
•  Special relativity’s aberration formula can 

be calculated from general principles 
without committing to special relativity’s 
shift equations.  

•  Transverse redshifts can also be derived 

from a first-order Doppler equation, 
although the strength of the effect is 
different under special relativity.  

•  Special relativity’s key relationships can be 

deduced from the principle of relativity 
and the “relativistic Doppler” shift 
equation without assuming that spacetime 
is flat, suggesting the possibility of a “non-
flat” variation on special relativity.     

Although these points are probably not new, 
they can be difficult to derive by other means.

axis, and these rings illuminate sequentially, the result is a

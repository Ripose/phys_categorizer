Abstract 

Optical  interference  holography  has  been  proved  to  be  a  useful  technique  in  fabricating 

periodic photonic crystals in which electromagnetic waves are forbidden in certain frequency 

bandgaps.   Compared to periodic crystals quasicrystals, having higher point group symmetry, 

are more favourable in achieving complete bandgaps.   In this report, we propose two seven-

beam  optical  interference  configurations  based  on  the  reciprocal  vector  space  representations 

for  quasicrystals  to  fabricate  icosahedral  quasicrystals.    Interference  simulations  for  the 

quasicrystals  exhibit  the  full  symmetry  of  an  icosahedron.    The  result  paves  the  path  for  the 

fabrication of photonic quasicrystals using holographic lithography. 

Keywords: quasicrystals, photonic bandgap materials, holography

  Quasicrystalline  structures  (quasicrystals),  discovered  in  alloys  in  the  early  eighties,  have 

higher  point  group  symmetry  than  ordinary  periodic  crystals.    They  exhibit  long-range 

aperiodic  order  and  rotational  symmetries  that  fall  outside  the  traditional  crystallographic 

classification  schemes.[1]    It  was  suggested[2]  that  quasicrystals,  with  mesoscale  features,  can 

possess  photonic  bandgaps  in  which  electromagnetic  wave  propagation  is  forbidden.[3] 

Furthermore, because of the higher rotational symmetry of the quasicrystals, the bandgaps are 

more isotropic and thus are more favourable in achieving complete bandgaps than conventional 

photonic  crystals.    Photonic  crystals  have  been  fabricated  by  techniques  such  as  the  self-

assembly  of  colloidal  microspheres  or  micro-fabrication,  and  recently,  the  holographic 

lithography  and  the  multi-photon  direct  laser  writing.[4-7]  However,  it  is  difficult  to  fabricate 

quasicrystals  by  the  self-assembly  and  micro-fabricating  techniques  in  2D  and  nearly 

impossible  in  3D.[8]  Using  a  stereo  lithography  method,  photonic  icosahedral  quasicrystals 

have  recently  been  fabricated  exhibiting  sizeable  bandgaps  in  the  microwave  range.[9]  

However, it is still a challenge to fabricate quasicrystals in the visible range.  Recently, it has 

been  demonstrated  that  holographic  lithography  can  be  used  to  fabricate  2D  and  quasi-3D 

quasicrystals  in  photoresists  in  the  submicron  scales.[10]    To  create  periodic  interference 

patterns  for  the  holographic  lithography,  coherent  beams  from  a  single  source  have  to  be 

configured  with  the  wave  vectors 

 such  that

 of  the  periodic  structures.    For  the  usual  periodic  crystals  the  reciprocal  base 

vectors  are  known,  e.g.  FCC  lattice  can  be  obtained  from  BCC  reciprocal  lattice  constructed 

from  a  4-beam  interference  with  an  “inverted-umbrella”  configuration.

[6]    For  quasicrystals, 

more than 4 (usually 6) reciprocal base vectors are needed, making the task highly non-trivial.   

Here  we  report  two  optical  interference  configurations  for  icosahedral  quasicrystals  using 

seven  coherent  beams  from  a  single  light  source.    The  interference  patterns  display  the  full 

symmetry  of  an  icosahedron.    More  importantly,  these  beam  configurations  are  accessible  in

experimental setups commonly used in holographic lithography.  Our result paves the road for 

the realization of complete bandgaps for quasicrystals in the optical range.   

  Quasicrystals  can  be  classified  either  as  physical  3D  projections  of  higher-dimensional 

periodic  structures  or  in  terms  of  wave  vectors  in  the  reciprocal  space  corresponding  to  the 

diffraction  patterns  of  the  quasicrystals.[11]    It  is  the  reciprocal  vector  space  approach  that 

provides the basis for fabricating quasicrystals using optical interference holography.  For the 

icosahedral  lattice,  it  was  shown  that  there  are  three  distinct  reciprocal  icosahedral  basis: 

primitive P*, face-centered F*, and body-centered I*, corresponding to the conventional P, I, 

and F real-space lattices[11,12] spanned by the linear combinations of six base vectors

.    (The  asterisk  denotes  the  reciprocal vector space.) Equations 1(a) 

and (b) in Table 1 are two bases for the icosahedral quasicrystal dictating the six base vectors 

along 5-fold axes of an icosahedron.  In one basis five base vectors are arranged symmetrically 

about  the  sixth  vector  (Fig.  1(a))  while  in  the  other  basis  all  six  base  vectors  are  arranged 

around a 3-fold axis (Fig. 1(b)).

[11,13]  We have identified two sets, lattices A[11] and B[12], of 

reciprocal  primitive  base  vectors 

 (i = 0-5 and 1-6 for lattices A and B, respectively) for 

}{ iqr

the  face-centered  F*  lattice  (Eqs.  2(a)  and  (b)  in  Table  1)  that  can  be  generated  by  seven 

interfering wave vectors 

 (Eqs. 3(a) and (b) in Table 1).   Note that not all the 

iqr  have the 

same magnitude while 

 are all equal, satisfying the condition that the interfering light beams 

have to be from a single source.  No such set of wave vectors is found for the primitive P* and 

body-centered  I*  lattices.    Equations  4(a)  and  (b)  show  the  relations  between  the  reciprocal 

base  vectors  and  the  wave  vectors  for  the  two  lattices  while  Figs.  1(c)  and  (d)  show  the 

geometrical arrangements of the reciprocal base vectors (green arrows) and the wave vectors

easily achieved by seven light beams from a single light source, enabling possible realization 

of the icosahedral quasicrystals using the standard holographic lithography technique.[6,14]  

  With the wave vectors from Eqs. 3(a) and (b), the interference pattern of the seven coherent

 as the angle

 and the central wave

can  be  taken  as  the  same  for  all  wave  vectors,  leaving  only

adjustable  parameters.    We  determine  the  polarization  of  each  side  beam  by  requiring 

r
maximum  contrast  between  the  individual  side  beam lk

 and  the  central  beam 

.    As  for  the 

r

phases, four of them can be arbitrarily set to zero because it is the differences of the phases that 

determine  the  final  pattern,  leaving  only  three  phases  as  free  parameters.    In  principle  more 

sophisticated methods can be used to select the optimal parameters.[15]  Here, we take it as a 

“proof-of-principle” and vary the parameters to study their effects. 

 

Figure 2(b) shows the interference pattern as intensity contour surfaces for lattice A from 

Eq.  (6)  using  wave  vectors  given  by  Eq.  3(a)  with  maximum  contrast  polarizations

.    The 

3D  perspective  image  viewed  along  the  [111]  direction  in  Fig.  2(b)  consists  of  contour 

surfaces, shown as “dots”, at 60% intensity cutoff.  The 3-fold symmetry is clearly shown.  The 

other images in Fig. 2(b) are projections along the different symmetry axes as indicated in the 

icosahedral quasicrystal shown in the figure.  The 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold symmetries of the 

icosahedron are clearly shown and compare well to corresponding projections in Fig. 2(a) for 

an  icosahedron  obtained  by  placing  “atoms”  at  lattice  sites  using  Eq.  (5)  with

±±=in
{

}2,1,0

.  

Note  that  the  construction  projections  will  look  denser  when  larger  values  are  used  for  ni.  

Nevertheless, the simulation and the construction agree very well, despite the small difference 

in the sharp and size of individual “dots” in the simulation.  Note that for lower intensity cutoff 

the “dots” will become interconnected making it more complicated for analysis.  Figure 2(c) is 

the  simulation  with  60% 

intensity  cutoff 

for 

lattice  B  using  Eq.  3(b)  with

  The 

agreement with the icosahedron construction is as equally good. 

  While 

the  full 

icosahedral  symmetry 

is  obtained  using 

the  maximum  contrast 

configurations, it turns out that the interference pattern is very sensitive to the polarizations of 

the beams as shown in Fig. 3(a) a simulation for lattice A using

.  Except the 5-fold symmetry along the axis of symmetry of 

the interfering beams, the 2-fold and 3-fold symmetries are lost as shown in the P (2-fold) and 

 

5

Q  (3-fold)  projections,  demonstrating  that  this  set  of  parameters  does  not  produce  the  full 

symmetry  of  the  icosahedral  quasicrystal.    In  contrast  to  the  polarizations,  the  phases  of  the 

beams do not seem to be critical as shown in Fig. 3(b) a simulation with arbitrary phases but 

keeping the polarizations as used in Fig. 2(b).  The full symmetry for the icosahedron is still 

discernible  except  that  the  patterns  are  shifted  as  compared  to  those  shown  in  Fig.  2(b).   

Similar  results  are  obtained  for  more  than  100  simulations  with  random  phases.    This 

insensitiveness to the phases of the interfering beams increases the success rate of fabricating 

the  icosahedral  quasicrystal  using  the  holographic  lithography  technique  as  implemented 

recently in an experiment for the visible range.[14]   

 

  To conclude, we have identified two sets of reciprocal base vectors in the face-centered 

F* lattice representation for the icosahedral quasicrystals such that they can be obtained from 

seven  wave  vectors  with  a  single  wavelength.    The  interference  patterns  obtained  from  the 

seven  beams  display  the  full  symmetry  of  the  icosahedron.    More  importantly,  the  beam 

configurations  are  easily  accessible  to  experiment  in  usual  holographic  lithography  setups, 

paving the path to obtain complete bandgaps photonic quasicrystals.

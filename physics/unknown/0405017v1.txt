Energy resonance in scattering is usually investigated either directly in the complex 
 
energy plane (E-plane) or indirectly in the complex angular momentum plane (L-plane). 
Another formulation complementing these two approaches was introduced recently. It is 
an indirect algebraic method that studies resonances in a complex charge plane (Z-plane). 
This  latter  approach  will  be  generalized  to  provide  a  unified  algebraic  treatment  of 
resonances  in  the  complex  E-,  L-,  and Z-planes. The complex scaling (rotation) method 
will  be  used  in  the  development  of  this  approach.  The  resolvent  operators  (Green’s 
functions)  are  formally  defined  in  these  three  spaces.  Bound  states  spectrum  and 
resonance energies in the E-plane are mapped onto a discrete set of poles of the respective 
resolvent  operator  on  the  real  line  of  the  L-  and  Z-planes.  These  poles  move  along 
trajectories  as  the  energy  is  varied.  A  finite  square  integrable  basis  is  used  in  the 
numerical  implementation  of  this  approach.  Stability  of  poles  and  trajectories  against 
variation in all computational parameters is demonstrated. Resonance energies for a given 
potential are calculated and compared with those obtained by other studies.

Studying energy resonances associated with the scattering of a projectile by a target 
is essential for the understanding of both the structure of the target and the interaction of 
the projectile-target system. Several techniques have been developed for the investigation 
of  resonances  and  the  analysis  of  scattering  data  in  the  search  for  their  specific 
signatures.  The  objective  of  most  theoretical  studies  on  resonances  is  to  increase  the 
accuracy of the values obtained and to improve the computational efficiency in locating 
their positions and widths [1]. Resonance energies are identified with the complex poles

−
located  in  the  lower  half  of  the  complex  energy  plane  for  systems  with  a  self-adjoint 
Hamiltonian, H. Resonance states are bound-like states that are unstable and decay with a 
rate  that  increases  with  the  (negative)  value  of  the  imaginary  part  of  the  resonance 
energy. Sharp or “shallow” resonances (those located below and close to the real energy 
axis in the complex E-plane) are more stable; they decay more slowly and are easier to 
obtain  than  broad  or  “deep”  resonances  that  are  located  below,  but  far  from,  the  real 
energy  axis.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  resonances  are  not  necessarily  confined 
only  to  the  continuum.  Resonance  states  for  certain  potentials  (e.g., 
)  may 
also  be  found  embedded  between  bound  states,  such  that  the  real  part  of  the  resonance 
energy becomes negative [2]. In such cases, however, these states are typically the most 
unstable,  with  the  negative  imaginary  part  of  the  energy  of  these  resonances  being  the 
largest.  Most of the algebraic methods used for the study of resonances are performed 
directly  in  the  complex  energy  plane,  whereas  most  of  the  analytic  investigations  are 
performed  in  the  complex  angular  momentum  plane.  An  example  of  the  algebraic 
approach  is  the  use  of  the  R-matrix  method  of  scattering  [3],  whereas  the  Regge-
Sommerfeld-Watson method [4] is an example of an analytic approach.

The energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian (poles of the Green’s function 

 for 
 
real  (cid:65)   and  Z)  in  the  complex  energy  plane  consists,  generally,  of  three  parts:  (1)  a 
discrete set of real points on the negative energy axis corresponding to the bound states, 
(2) the real positive energy line which corresponds to the continuum scattering states, and 
(3)  another  discrete  set  of  points  in  the  lower  half  of  the  complex  energy  plane 
corresponding to the resonance states. Figure 1 shows such a structure, associated with

An alternative approach was introduced recently for the study of resonances which 
complements the two methods mentioned above [5]. It is an algebraic method that was 
developed  in  the  complex  charge  plane  (Z-plane),  and  is  consequently  best  suited  for 
applications of scattering processes involving charged particles. The scattering of neutral 
particles is obviously a special case. Bound states spectrum and resonance energies in the 
E-plane  are  mapped  onto  a  discrete  set  of  poles  of  the  resolvent  operator  (the  Green’s 
)  on  the  real  line  of  the  complex  Z-plane.  These  poles  are  located  at 
function 
integral  values  of  Z  for  scattering  involving  elementary  particles,  such  that  Z  = 
. As we vary the (complex) energy, these poles move along trajectories in the 
0, 1, 2,..
± ±
Z-plane.  One  of  the  biggest  advantages  of  this  formulation  is  its  close  formal  and 
computational  affinity  to  Regge  theory  in  the  complex  angular  momentum  plane  [4,6] 
allowing  for  the  use  of  all  the  analytic  and  numerical  tools  used  in  that  theoretical 
scheme. In particular, the scattering matrix could be studied by the analysis of the poles 
and their trajectories in the complex Z-plane in much the same way as that involving the 
analysis of Regge poles and Regge trajectories in the complex  (cid:65) –plane. 
 
 
The basic underlying principle in the various numerical methods used for the study 
of  resonances  is  that  the  position  of  a  resonance  is  stable  against  variation  in  all 
computational  parameters.  In  this  paper  we  use  the  same  principle  to  generalize  the 
algebraic  approach,  developed  in  the  complex  Z-plane  [5],  to  give  a  unified  algebraic 
treatment of resonances in the complex E−,  (cid:65) −, and Z–planes. We employ the complex 
scaling (rotation) method [7] in the generalization of this approach. A brief presentation 
detailing  the  implementation  of  this  approach  in  the  E-plane  will  be  given  in  the 
following section. A short description of the development of the same approach in the Z-
plane will be given in Section III. This is followed by an algebraic reformulation of the 
Regge poles and Regge trajectories in the complex  (cid:65) –plane in Section IV. Examples of 
simple  potential  scattering  will  be  given  to  illustrate  the  utility  and  demonstrate  the 
accuracy of the approach. The paper concludes with a short discussion. 
 
 

II. RESONANCE IN THE E–PLANE 

)

 
Direct  study  of  resonances  is  usually  done  in  the  complex  energy  plane.  As 
 
mentioned above, resonance energies are the subset of the poles of the Green’s function 
  (for  real  (cid:65)   and  Z),  which  are  located  in  the  lower  half  of  the  complex  energy 
ZG E(cid:65)
, (
plane. One way to uncover these resonances, which are “hidden” below the real line in 
the  E-plane,  is  to  use  the  complex  scaling  (a.k.a.  complex  rotation)  method  [7].  This 
method  exposes  the  resonance  poles  and  makes  their  study  easier  and  manipulation 
re θ→ , where θ is a 
simpler. In this method, the radial coordinate gets transformed as

real  angular  parameter.  The  effect  of  this  transformation  on  the  pole  structure  of 
 in the E-plane, where  H θ  is the complex-rotated full Hamiltonian, 
ZG E
, (
consists of the following: (1) the discrete bound state spectrum that lies on the negative 
energy  axis  remains  unchanged;  (2)  the  branch  cut  (the  discontinuity)  along  the  real 
positive energy axis rotates clockwise by the angle 2θ ; (3) resonances in the lower half 
of the complex energy plane located in the sector bound by the new rotated cut line and 
the positive energy axis get exposed and become isolated. However, due to the finite size 
of  the  basis  used  in  performing  the  calculation,  the  matrix  representation  of  the 
Hamiltonian is finite resulting in a discrete set of eigenvalues. Consequently, the rotated 
cut  line  gets  replaced  by  a  string  of  interleaved  poles  and  zeros  of  the  finite  Green’s 
function,  which  tries  to  mimic  the  cut  structure.  Nonetheless,  the  subset  of  these 
eigenvalues  that  corresponds  to  the  bound  states  and  resonance  spectra  remain  stable 
against variations in all computational parameters (including θ, as long as these poles are 
far  enough  from  the  cut  “line”).  The  objects  and  tools  of  this  approach  that  enable  the 
calculation  of  resonances  and  manipulation  of  their  trajectories  in  the  complex  E-plane 
will now be presented.

To illustrate these findings, we consider the Hamiltonian with the potential 
V r

Such  a  representation  is  the  fundamental  underlying  structure  of  certain  algebraic 
scattering methods, such as the R-matrix [3] and J-matrix [10] methods. Nevertheless, we 
will  confine  our  present  implementation  of  the  approach  to  the  finite  matrix 
representation (in the subspace { } 1

reported in the near future.

which has been studied frequently in the literature [2,11-13]. Figure 2 shows snapshots 
from  a  video  that  shows  how  resonances  become  exposed  as  the  cut  “line”  sweeps  the 
lower half of the E-plane. These snapshots are for different values of Z and  (cid:65) , and  are 
taken when the angle θ of the complex rotation reaches 1.0 rad. We make no attempt to 
calculate  resonance  energies  in  this  case  since  the  method  of  complex  rotation  in  the 
energy plane is well-known. However, initial estimates obtained by this method will be 
used  as  input  for  the  next  two  methods  to  illustrate  the  extent  of  their  accuracy  and  to 
determine the degree to which they improve on these values. 
 
In the following two sections the above findings will be extended to the study and 
 
analysis of resonances and their structure for the potential 
 in the complex Z-
plane  and  (cid:65) -plane.  The  first  case  has  been  developed  in  detail  [5]  and  will  be 
summarized in the following section.

comparing  it  with  the  corresponding  behavior  in  the  complex  energy  plane,  and  noting

sweeps  the  upper  half  of  the  complex  charge  plane.  Two  strings  of  poles  are  clearly 
exposed while a third just starting to appear. The snapshot is taken at θ = 1.0 rad. As we 
vary the energy, which is generally complex, these poles move along trajectories in the 
complex  Z-plane.  The  points  where  the  stable  trajectories  cross  the  real  Z-axis 
correspond to resonances. The relevant crossings involving the scattering of elementary 
particles are those at 
. Therefore, one simple and direct strategy to search 
for  resonances  in  the  complex  Z-plane  is  to  calculate  the  poles  of  the  Green’s  function 
ˆ
 for a given real  (cid:65)  and complex E. Subsequently, E is varied until one or more of 
EG Z(cid:65)
(
the  trajectories  cross  the  real  Z-axis  at  integral  values.  In  practice,  one  starts  with  an 
initial estimate for the energy value of a resonance obtained by an approximate method. 
One  then  zooms  in  at  the  crossings  to  refine  the  search.  A  numerical  algorithm  using 
bisection or Newton-Raphson routines [14] could be developed to automate the search. 
 
To illustrate the utility and demonstrate the accuracy of this approach, we use it in 
 
the  calculation  of  the  energy  spectrum  (including  bound  states  and  resonances)  of  the 
Hamiltonian with the potential (1.1). Table I lists some values for resonance energies and 
bound  states  obtained  by  this  approach,  in  which  we  also  compare  these  values  with 
those obtained by other studies. The size of the basis used in our calculation is N = 200. 
Stability of this calculation is observed for a substantial variation in the parameters λ and 
θ. To provide a graphical illustration of our findings we consider the potential function in 
(2.10). Figure 4 shows the lowest p-wave trajectories for real energies; they start on the 
real  Z-axis  for  low  energies  and  bend  upwards  as  the  energy  increases.  Bound  states 
correspond to points on the trajectories that coincide with the real Z-axis, and for which 
the  energy  is  negative  and  Z  is  an  integer.  On  the  other  hand,  resonance  information 
could also be extracted from residues of the poles along these trajectories for which the 
energy is positive and the real part of the pole is an integer. These properties are similar 
to  those  of  the  Regge  trajectories  in  the  complex  angular  momentum  plane.  The  same 
illustration for s-wave trajectories is repeated in Figure 5, but now the energy has a non-
vanishing  imaginary  part.  It  shows  several  crossings  at,  or  near,  Z  =  −8,  −4,  and  9, 
indicating resonances. 
 
 

IV. RESONANCE IN THE (cid:65) -PLANE 

 
The  study  of  the  analytic  properties  of  the  S-matrix  in  the  complex  angular 
 
momentum  plane  is  one  of  the  most  active  areas  of  research  in  scattering  theory, 
especially  in  high  energy  physics.  In  these  analytic  studies,  Regge  poles  and  their 
residues and trajectories are the main objects used in the investigation. In this section we 
give  an  algebraic  representation  of  Regge  poles  and  Regge  trajectories  in  the  (cid:65) –plane

in the  (cid:65) –plane. These are the poles of the resolvent operator 

(cid:65)
, ( )
This operator has a discontinuity along the vertical axis 
 in the upper half of the 
complex  (cid:65) –plane.  However,  this  discontinuity  does  not  rotate  under  the  action  of 
complex scaling, in contrast to results obtained from the E- and Z-planes. Variations in 
the values of the computational parameters ν, λ and θ produce changes in the location of 
most of these poles. However, those poles that are stable against these variations (around 
a plateau) are the ones that are physically significant. In fact, for real values of Z these 
poles  are  points  on  the  Regge  trajectories  in  the  complex  (cid:65) –plane.  As  we  vary  the 
energy, these points move along their respective trajectories. Figure 6 shows the lowest 
Regge trajectories associated with the potential (1.1) for real energies while Z = −1. They 
start  on  the  real  (cid:65) -axis  for  low  energies  and  bend  upwards  as  the  energy  increases. 
Bound  states  correspond  to  points  on  the  trajectories  that  coincide  with  the  real  (cid:65) -axis 
0,1,2,..
for which the energy is negative and 
. The same (with Z  =  0)  is  repeated  as 
Figure 7 but for complex values of energy. It shows one of the trajectories crossing the 
real line at  (cid:65)  = 3, indicating resonance.

V. DISCUSSION 

The  reference  Hamiltonian 

 
 
0H   which  we  have  considered  in  this  paper  involves 
the Coulomb potential  Z r . However, the algebraic approach for the study of resonances 
presented  here  could  easily  be  extended  to  other  reference  potentials.  In  fact,  all 
potentials that belong to the class of exactly solvable problems are compatible with this 
approach. In particular, shape invariant potentials [15] constitute such a class. This class 
includes the Oscillator, Coulomb, Morse, Scarf, Pöschl-Teller, amongst others. It might 
also  be  possible  that  conditionally  exactly  and  quasi-exactly  solvable  potentials  are 
compatible  with  this  algebraic  approach.  We  consider  briefly  the  Morse  potential  to 
illustrate these possibilities. 
 
 
The  time-independent  Schrödinger  equation  for  a  one-dimensional  system  under 
the influence of the potential V(x) in the presence of the background Morse potential is 
represented as follows:

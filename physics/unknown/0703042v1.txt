We consider a far infrared (terahertz), room-temperature detector based on a  microcantilever 
sensor  of  the  radiation  pressure.  This  system  has  a  significantly  higher  sensitivity  than  existing 
uncooled  detectors  in  the  far  infrared  (terahertz)  spectral  region.  The  significant  enhancement  of 
sensitivity  is  due  the  combination  non-absorption  detection  method  and  high  quality  optical 
microcavity.  Our  theoretical  analysis  of  the  detector  sensitivity  and  numerical  simulations 
demonstrate  that  the  narrowband  heterodyne  detector  with  the  band  width  30  MHz  has  a  minimal 
measurable intensity by three orders of magnitude less than conventional uncooled detectors. In the 
case of the broadband detector, the noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) is 7.6 mK, which 
is significantly smaller  than for conventional uncooled thermal detectors.  

I. Introduction 

Improvement  of  the  sensitivity  of  detection  in  the  far  infrared  (terahertz)  region  is  very 

important  for  many  applications  including  remote  sensing  of  explosive  materials,  chemical,  and 

biological agents, surveillance, night-vision, and medical imaging. Uncooled thermal detectors are 

very  desirable  because  cooling  systems  add  cost  and  cause  reliability  problems  that  are 

incompatible  with  most  applications.  Recently,  significant  progress  has  been  demonstrated  for 

 

 

 

uncooled  thermal  detectors  based  on  microcantilever  arrays1-4.  Microcantilever  systems  are 

potentially  more  sensitive  and  have  shorter  response  times  than  conventional  thermoelectric  and 

semiconductor solid state detectors.  In conventional thermoelectric imagers the temperature rise in 

each  pixel  is  measured  electrically.  The  electrical  connectivity  to  each  pixel  causes  prohibitive 

complexity and cost. A microcantilever-based imager could have full optical readout, eliminating 

readout electronics, a very attractive feature. Currently microcantilever-based detectors exploit the 

thermo-mechanical  effect,  in  which  a  bilayer  microcantilever  illuminated  by  radiation  exhibits 

banding  due  to  the  difference  in  the  thermal  expansion  coefficients  of  the  different  layers.    This 

measurement  method  has  some  limitations  for  the  sensitivity  and  response  time.  In  the  present 

paper,  we  propose  to  utilize  the  radiation  pressure  to  measure  the  radiation  power.  We  showed 
recently5,6 that, using the radiation pressure, the microcantilever detector significantly improves the 

sensitivity  of  the  frequency  modulation  spectroscopy.  One  of  the  significant  advantages  of 

radiation pressure measurements is the possibility of using a high quality microcavity, which leads 

to a significant sensitivity enhancement due to this non-absorption mechanism of detection. Note 

that application of an optical microcavity to absorption detectors leads to a moderate enhancement 

of  sensitivity  because  absorption  at  the  photosensitive  surface  affects  the  quality  of  optical 

resonator. We consider two applications: i) a narrowband heterodyne detector and ii) a broadband 

detector.  The  narrowband 

heterodyne  detector  could  be 

used 

as 

a  miniature 

spectrometer.  The  broadband 

detector  potentially  could  be 

used in a new type of thermal 

imager.  In  the  case  of  the 

narrowband 

detector, 

a 

 

microcantilever  senses 

the 

beats between the heterodyne 

field and spectral components

of the signal. The frequencies of the signal spectral components which we detect are shifted to the 

red and blue relative to the heterodyne frequency by an amount equal to the cantilever resonance 

frequency.  The  spectrum  of  the  signal  can  be  scanned  by  tuning  the  heterodyne  frequency.  

 

 

Fortunately,  compact,  uncooled  far  infrared  solid  state  lasers  are  available7,8.  Application  of  the 

standard  microcavity  techniques  gives  an  additional  increase  of  sensitivity  due  to  cavity 

enhancements of both the heterodyne and the 

signal  fields.  In  the  present  paper,  we 

describe 

the 

results  of  our 

theoretical 

analysis  and  numerical  simulations  of  the 

microcantilever-based 

detectors 

schematically  depicted  in  Figs.  1  and  2.  We 

show 

that 

i) 

the  proposed  narrowband 

detector  is  expected  to  have  a  sensitivity 

three  orders  of  magnitude  better  than  the 

typical  sensitivity  of  conventional  uncooled 

far  infrared  (terahertz)  detectors,  and  ii)  the 

Fig. 2. Setup of the  broadband thermal radiation detector.

 

broadband detector potentially has the sensitivity one order of magnitude better than conventional 

uncooled thermal detectors.  

II. Sensitivity analysis of a narrow band heterodyne detector 

Figure  1  shows  a  possible  setup  for  a  microcantilever-based  narrowband  detector  as  a  radiation 

pressure  sensor.  This  optical  scheme  is  similar  to  that  used  for  efficient  laser  cooling  of 
microcantilever9,10, which could cool the microcantilever to its quantum mechanical ground state. 

The  radiation  of  the  heterodyne  laser  is  mixed  with  the  signal  and  sent  through  an  optical 

waveguide,  the  other  end  of  which  is  polished  and  coated  with  a  high  reflectivity  material  (for 

example a Bragg mirror).  

The  coated  waveguide  end,  in  combination  with  the  coated  surface  of  the  cantilever,  forms  a 

Fabry-Perot  optical  resonator.  The  cantilever  oscillations  are  measured  by  a  Michelson 

interferometer.  We  use  a  model  that  describes  the  oscillations  of  the  cantilever  as  a  damped 

harmonic oscillator driven by light pressure and thermal noise. The fields in the Fabry-Perot cavity 

are  described  by  resonator  equations,  which  include  damping  and  incident  waves.  The 

electromagnetic fields are written in the form

  It  is  known9  that  this  term  leads  to  a 

steady  state  shift  of  the  cantilever  amplitude  to  a  new  point  of  equilibrium,  and  it  changes  the 

frequency and damping rate of the cantilever oscillations. The analysis of influence of this term on 

the  sensitivity  of  the  detector  is  performed  in  Section  III.    We  assume  that  the  signal  is  the

that  the  system  of  equations  for  the  harmonic  oscillator  and  the  field  in  the  optical  cavity  (Eqs. 

5a,b) is a nonlinear problem due to the nonlinear dependence of the field amplitude in the resonator 

on  the  microcantilever  coordinate  given  by  Eq.  (3).  We  consider  a  linear  approximation  for  the 

solution of Eqs. (5a,b). We assume that for realistic values of parameters the oscillation amplitude 

of  the  cantilever  is  much  smaller  than  the  region  of  dispersion  of  the  optical  resonator.  Our 

numerical simulations, presented below, confirm this assumption. The equilibrium position of the 

microcantilever can be chosen to provide the maximal field enhancement inside the resonator. In 

this case Eq. (3) gives

negligibly  small  compared  with  the  resonator  line  width.  Thus  Eq.  (10)  could  be  satisfied

  Comparison  of  these  two  cases  shows  that  most  critical  parameter  is  the 

coefficient  of  reflection, R .  The  value  of  the  reflectance  obtained  for  micromechanical  Bragg 
mirrors10,11 is not highest for this technology. As authors11 note, the Bragg mirror technology can 

provide the reflection coefficient even higher than 0.999999. Mirrors with reflectance 0.9999 for 

infrared  radiation  are  commercially  available.  The  adaptation  of 

this 

technology  for 

micromechanical  mirrors  leads  to  tremendous  progress  in  the  sensitivity.  For  example,  using  the 

value of a reflection coefficient 

R =

 and the values of others parameters used in Example

spectrometer described above is defined by the heterodyne laser line width. For comparison of the 

sensitivity of the proposed spectrometer with a standard IR-spectrometer with uncooled detector, 

consider a numerical example. If the heterodyne laser has the line width,

spectral  interval,  8 14  mµ−

Thus, the microcantilever spectrometer has a sensitivity that is three orders of magnitude better.

 

      In  our  estimations  we  use  a  rather  high  quality  factor  of  the  microcantilever  oscillator, 

ω Γ =

    This  quality  factor  is  typical  for  microcantilevers  placed  in  a  vacuum 

chamber.  The  vacuum  technology  is  well  developed  and  is  commonly  used  in  microcantilever 
based thermal imagers4.  

 

III. Thermal radiation detector 

 

Thermal  imaging  usually  exploits  broad  band  infrared  radiation  corresponding  to  the  window  of 

atmospheric  transparency  8  –  14 mµ .  For  these  applications  we  consider  a  scheme  in  which  IR 

radiation intensity is modulated by the optical modulator (see Fig. 2) at a frequency equal to the 

resonance  cantilever  frequency, 

0ω .  In  order  to  fulfill  the  resonance  condition  for  each  spectral 

amplitude of the radiation field, a certain spectral amplitude must be sent into the resonator at the 

proper angle. This could be obtained, for example, using a volume holographic grating (see Fig. 2).  

The intensity modulation coefficient can be presented in the form

 This value of NETD is an order of magnitude less than conventional 

uncooled bolometers usually have, and it is comparable with a theoretical limit, 9.2 mK,  for  the 
thermo-mechanical detectors4.  Note that the radiation pressure measurements are less affected by 

temperature fluctuations compared with thermo-mechanical detectors.  

IV. Numerical simulations 

For numerical simulations we use Eqs. (2,4). The thermal noise and the signal are simulated  by a 

standard  random  number  generator,  which  produces  a  random  sequence  of  pulses.  The  time 

duration  of 

these  pulses, 

,t∆  

is  much  shorter 

than 

the  oscillation  period  of 

the 

microcantilever,

interval


 .    To  avoid  undesirable  correlations  between  the  signal  and  thermal  noise 

processes,  we  use  two  different  generators  of  random  pulses.  We  find  that  for  nonlinear 

oscillations,  when  the  amplitude  of  thermal  oscillations, Tx ,  is  comparable  with  the  optical 

resonator  dispersion  length,  l ,    the  nonlinearity  leads  to  a  significant  decrease  in  the  signal-to- 

noise  ratio.    Thus,  the  nonlinearity  is  an  undesirable  feature.  The  values  of  parameters,  chosen 

above in Section II, provide a linear regime of microcantilever oscillations. To control the linearity, 

we  calculate  the  mean  square  amplitude  for  the  thermal  noise 

  only  (with  a  zero  signal), 

2 ( )
Tx t

then calculate the mean square signal amplitude 

 without the thermal noise, and calculate 

2 ( )
sx t

the mean square amplitude 

2 ( )
x t

 for conditions in which   both noises exist. In the linear case, 

the last sum is equal to the sum of mean square amplitudes calculated separately:

As  shown  in  the  Section  II,  the 

highest sensitivity is obtained when 

the  optical  resonator  is  tuned  to 

exact 

resonance  with 

the  both 

heterodyne 

and 

signal 

fields. 

However,  the  non-resonant  term  in 

Eq.  (4)  induces  a  shift  of  the 

equilibrium 

position 

of 

the 

amplitude 

of 

oscillations. 

Nevertheless,  the  optimal  position 

can  be  obtained  by  introducing  an 

cantilever relative to the resonance. 

(See  Fig.  3.)

These  dependences  demonstrate  the  well-known12  bi-stable  type  of  curves.  To  avoid  undesirable 

instability, a practically acceptable region must 

be chosen outside of the bi-stable region.

IV. Conclusion 

 

 

We  have  described  a  far  infrared  (terahertz),  uncooled  detector  based  on  a  microcantilever  as  a 

radiation pressure sensor, which is expected to have a significantly higher sensitivity than existing 

uncooled  detectors  in  the  far  infrared-terahertz  spectral  region.  The  significant  enhancement  of 

sensitivity  is  due  the  combination  non-absorption  detection  method  and  high  quality  optical

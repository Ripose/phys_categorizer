Igor D. Kaganovich 
Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, 08543, USA 

Most plasmas have a very thin sheath compared with the plasma dimension. This necessitates 
separate  calculations  of  the  plasma  and  sheath.    The  Bohm  criterion  provides  the  boundary 
condition for calculation of plasma profiles. To calculate sheath properties a value of electric field 
at the plasma-sheath interface has to be specified in addition to the Bohm criterion. The value of 
the boundary electric field and robust procedure to approximately patch plasma and collisionless 
sheath with a very good accuracy are reported. 

I. 

Introduction 

The  calculation  of  plasma  profiles  is  nowadays  a 
routine task. In most plasmas employed in applications the 
Debye  length  λD  is  small  compared  with  the  plasma  half 
width L. Resolving the small Debye length throughout the 
whole plasma requires solving Poisson equation, which is 
challenging computationally because the electric field has 
to be obtained from small differences between the electron 
and  ion  densities.  To  avoid  the  inconvenience,  the 
standard  procedure  is  to  separate  the  plasma  and  sheath 
regions, and to employ the quasineutrality condition in the 
plasma  region  instead  of  Poisson’s  equation.  The  Bohm 
criterion – setting the ion velocity equal to the ion  sound 
velocity  -  gives  the  boundary  condition  for  the  plasma 
region and uniquely defines plasma profiles. In contrast to 
the plasma region, the Bohm criterion is not sufficient for 
a unique determination of sheath properties.  

If the sheath potential is much larger than the electron 
temperature,  it  follows  from  the  Boltzmann  relation  that 
the  electron  density  in  the  sheath  can  be  neglected,  the  
plasma  sheath  boundary  can  be  assumed  infinitely  thin, 
and the electric field at the plasma-sheath interface can be 
set  to  zero.  This  approach  has  been  successfully  applied 
for  calculating  sheath  parameters  in  dc  (Child-Langmuir 
law [1]) and rf discharges [2, 3, and 4].  

The  relevant  question  is:  is  it  possible  to  calculate 
sheath properties with higher accuracy? If all regions with 
a length of order λD and a potential drop order the electron 
temperature  Te  have  to  be  resolved,  an  accurate  patching 
between  the  plasma  and  the  sheath  region  has  to  be 
performed. In general, it requires either a direct numerical 
solution of Poisson’s equation throughout the plasma and 
sheath 
asymptotic 
approximations,  as  described  in  Refs.  5,  and  6,  and  in 
references  there  in.  Numerical  simulation  of  Poisson’s 
equation  for  the  whole  discharge  is  computationally 
intensive  and  inefficient.  The  utilization  of  matched 
asymptotic  approximations  requires  a  great  deal  of 
mathematical  expertise  and 
is  not  very  robust  for 
engineering  purposes.  Therefore,  there  were  a  number  of 
attempts to patch the plasma and sheath approximately.  

applying  matched 

regions  or 

Poisson’s  equation  is  a  second  order  equation,  and  it 
requires  two  boundary  conditions:  the  potential  on  the 
wall,  and  another  condition  set  at  the  plasma-sheath

interface.  Because 
the  plasma-sheath 
the  position  of 
interface  is  unknown  a  priori,  the  values  of  both  the 
potential and the electric field have to be specified. In Refs. 
)
7 and 8 the value 
 was proposed for the electric 
field  at  the  plasma-sheath  patching  point,  where  λDs  is  the 
Debye length corresponding to the plasma density ns at the 
plasma-sheath interface. This electric field has been utilized 
as the boundary condition  to join the plasma and sheath in 
discrete  plasma-sheath  models  and  was  used 
the 
calculations of dc [7] and rf [3] sheaths.

This  approach  has  been  recently  criticized  in  Ref.  9, 
where  it  was  claimed  that  such  a  procedure  results  in  “the 
disjunction  between  the  plasma  and  sheath”.  In  their 
response  [10],  the  authors  of  Ref. 8  refuted  this  claim,  and 
explained that the sheath solution in Ref. 9 was taken with 
zero electric field at the plasma-sheath boundary instead of

In  this  Letter,  a  new  procedure  for  approximate

the  plasma-sheath  boundary  is  determined  from  numerical

addition,  it  was  found  that  accounting  for  the  small

Patching sheath and plasma 

The  Poisson  equation  (4)  is  a  second  order  equation, 
therefore, it requires two boundary conditions. One is the 
wV ,  and  another 
value  of  the  potential  at  the  wall 
boundary  condition  is  determined  from  correct  patching 
with the plasma. Using direct numerical integration of the

Fig.1 shows very good agreement between the exact

sheath interface was used, thus, producing an oversimplified 
patching, as described in Ref.10.   

Fig.2 depicts the electric field as a function of the 
normalized potential (-eV/Te). This figure is similar to Fig.2 
of Ref.9 but instead of patching the plasma solution Eq.(6)

very close to the exact solution, in disagreement with the

The patching of the sheath solution of Eq. (9) with the

apparently  gives  continuous  of  electric  field  profiles, 
because  the  electric  field  is  assumed  continous  in  the

same  time,  in  accord  with  Ref.9  the  value  of  the  electric 
field 
  (proposed  for  patching  in  Ref.7) 
corresponds to the point of exact solution V=-3Te  which is

IV. 

Transition layer 

The transition layer appears due to a sonic singularity 
in plasma equations.  As shown by Bohm [14], the sheath 
electric  field  can  be  smoothly  patched  with  the  small 
electric  field  in  the  plasma  (small  compared  with  the 
sheath) only if the ion flow velocity at the plasma-sheath 
boundary  is  larger  or  equal  to  the  ion  sound  velocity. 
Therefore,  a  transition  through  the  ion  sound  velocity 
should  occur  in  the  plasma.  It  follows  from  Eqs.(6)  that 
the ion sound velocity can not be exceeded in plasma with 
a  slab  geometry,  and,  therefore,  the  ion  sound  velocity 
must be reached at the boundary between the  sheath and 
plasma  regions.  The  situation  is  different  for  non  slab 
geometry.  If  plasma  expands  in  some  kind  of  plasma 
nozzle  with  cross-sectional  area  A(x).  The  continuity 
equations become instead of Eqs.(1) and (2)

other  side,  even  though  Poisson’s  equation  is  used  to 
determine the properties of the transition region, this region

Appendix I. Note on wall potential  
 

The  wall potential is to be determined by equating the 
ion  and  electron  fluxes.  The  ion  flux  is 
,  from 
Eq.(13).  The  electron  flux  is  given  by  an  integral  over  the 
electron  velocity  distribution  function  (EVDF)  for  all 
electrons with velocity directed toward the wall

Equation  (AI.3)  is  correct  for  a  collisionless  sheath  and 
either collisional or collisionless plasmas. For the case of a

Though  in  the  present  paper  only  the  Boltzmann 
relation is used, it is necessary to note that the Boltzmann 
relation  is  not  accurate  for  electrons  leaving  the  plasma 
and  being  lost  at  the  wall  (so  called  loss  cone).  The 
Boltzmann relation requires a Maxwellian EVDF and that 
the  electrons  are  trapped  in  a  potential  well.  Because  of 
fast losses to the wall, the EVDF is non-Maxwellian in the 
loss  cone.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  solve  the  kinetic 
equation for fast electrons to obtain a correct EVDF in the 
loss cone, and, subsequently, to predict the wall potential. 
Examples  of  such  a  calculation  are  given  in  Ref.16.  The 
analytical solution of the EVDF in the loss cone is given in 
Ref.17.

Published survival data for Chinese hamster ovarian cells CHO-K1 and their radiosensitive mutant xrs5 after irradiation 
by carbon ions of energies from 2.4 to 266.4 MeV/u have been analyzed using the probabilistic two-stage radiobiological 
model, which enables to represent the interplay of damage induction and repair processes. The results give support for 
the hypothesis that the differences in radiation sensitivity of diverse cell lines are given primarily by their different repair 
capabilities, and indicate the need  for explicitly representing the outcome of repair processes in radiobiological models 
and treatment planning approaches in radiotherapy. 

INTRODUCTION 

Differences  in  damage  induction,  especially  in  the 
yields  of  complex  double-strand  breaks  (DSBs)  and 
other types of clustered lesions(1), have been shown to 
correlate  with  the  differences  in  the  response  to 
radiations  of  diverse  quality.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
differences  in  the  response  to  the  same  radiation  kind 
observed  among  different  cell  lines  seem  to  be  given 
primarily  by  their  different  repair  capacities.  To  test 
this hypothesis, survival data for two hamster cell lines 
irradiated by carbon beams of different energies(2) have 
been  analyzed  in  detail.  The  studied  cell  lines  are  the 
wild-type  Chinese  hamster  ovarian  line  CHO-K1  and 
its  radiosensitive  mutant  xrs5,  which  differs  from  the 
wild-type  line  by  lacking  the  Ku80  subunit  of  the 
active  DNA-PK  complex  involved  in  the  DSB  repair. 
Accordingly,  the  two  lines  were  found  to  differ 
significantly  in  the  probabilities  of  repairing  the 
damage  successfully,  while  it  has  been  possible  to 
neglect minor differences in damage induction.

nucleus. Average probability that a single track induces 
lethal  damage  to  DNA  has  been  denoted  by  a. 
Similarly, b stands for the probability that a less severe 
lesion has been formed, which has to combine with at 
least  another  one  to  be  lethal  (“combined  lesions”)(3); 
the  term  (1-b2)k(k-1)  approximates  the  combined  effects 
of k tracks(3,4).

only  lesions  that  are  not  repaired  by  xrs5  cells  have

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 

While  the  differences  between  the  two  cell  lines  in 
damage  induction  by  single  carbon  tracks  might  have 
been  neglected,  the  derived  repair  success  probability 
(Figure 3)  demonstrates  that  the  wild-type  CHO-K1 
cells succeed in repairing large amounts of damage not 
repaired by xrs5 cells. This finding directly reflects the 
reduced DSB repair capacity of xrs5 cells. 

The present results indicate that differences in repair 
capacities  among  diverse  cell  lines  account  for  the 
differences  in  their  intrinsic  radiation  sensitivity.  In 
simplified  model  schemes(4-6),  only 
the  effective 
damage yields (yields of lethal damage not repaired by 
the cell) have been considered, i.e. the effects of repair 
processes  have  been 
the 
included 
description  of  damage 
induction.  Although  such 
simplified  approaches  can  be  used  successfully  in 
analyzing 
to  diverse 
the  differences  in  response 
radiation  qualities,  their  drawback  is  that  the  intrinsic 
radiation  sensitivity  of  different  cell  lines  is  only 
approximated.  The  present  results  stress  the  need  for 
further developing detailed biology-oriented models of 
radiobiological effects, which should reflect the results 
of damage induction and repair studies.

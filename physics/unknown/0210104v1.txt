ABSTRACT

The mobility 

  of excess electrons in dense Argon gas has been measured as a function

of  the  applied  electric  field  E    and  of  the  gas  density  N  at  several  temperatures  in  the

range  142.6<T<200  K,  encompassing  the  critical  temperature  Tc=150.86  K.  We  report

here measurements at densities up to N 7 nm-3, close to the critical density, Nc  8.1 nm-3,

reached for the isotherm closest to the critical one. At all temperatures, below as well as

above Tc, and up to moderately high densities, the density-normalized mobility  N shows

the usual electric field dependence present in a gas with a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum

due  to  the  mainly  attractive  electron-atom  interaction.  N  is  constant  and  field

independent for small values of E, shows a maximum for a reduced field E/N 

 4 mTd,

and  then  decreases  rapidly  with  the  field,  approximately  proportional  to  (E/N)-1/2.  The

zero-field  density-normalized  mobility 

0N,  for  all  T>Tc,  shows  the  well  known

anomalous  positive  density  effect,  i.e., 

0N  increases  with  increasing  N,  confirming

previous  results  obtained  for  T=300  K  and  162.7  K.  Below  Tc,  however, 

0N  does  not

show  the  expected  anomalous  positive  density  effect,  but  it  rather  features  a  broad

maximum.  This  appears  to  be  a  crossover  behavior  between  the  positive  density  effect

shown  for  T>Tc  and  the  small  negative  effect  previously  observed  for  T 90  K.  In  any

case,  the  data  at  all  temperatures  confirm  the  interpretation  of  the  anomalous  density

effect  as  being  essentially  due  by  the  density-dependent  quantum  shift  of  the  electron

ground state kinetic energy in a disordered medium as a result of multiple scattering (MS)

processes, although other MS processes do influence the outcome of the experiment.

1.  INTRODUCTION

The mobility 

 of excess electrons in dense non-polar gases is a well suited probe

to investigate the nature of the electronic states in a disordered system. In a dense gas the

transport  properties  of  electrons  depend  in  a  complicated  way  on  the  interplay  between

the dense environment and the quantum nature of the electron.

The  usual  picture  of  classical  kinetic  theory,  i.e.,  that  of  binary  electron-atom

collisions well separated in space and time, breaks down because of the short interatomic

distance  at  high  density  and  because  of  the  fairly  large  extension  of  the  electron

wavepacket,  especially  at  low  temperature.  As  the  gas  density  is  increased,  possibly  at

low  temperature,  the  electron  mean  free  path  gets  shorter  and  shorter  and  it  eventually

becomes  comparable  in  magnitude  to  the  electron  thermal  wavelength.  Moreover,  the

long thermal wavelength of the electrons makes them interact simultaneously with more

than one atom at once. In these conditions, multiple scattering (MS) processes influence

the electron energetics and, hence, its transport properties.

The classical kinetic theory for the electron mobility [1] predicts that the so called

zero-field  density-normalized  mobility 

0N,  at  constant  temperature  T,  does  not  depend

on the gas density N, and depends on the type of the gas only through the electron-atom

momentum transfer scattering cross section, s

mt, that embodies the quantum nature of the

electron-atom interaction. According to that theory, the density-normalized mobility for

near thermal electrons is given by

where m and e are the electron mass and charge, respectively, and kB is the Boltzmann’s

constant.  Eq.  (1)  shows  that,  once  the  type  of  the  host  atoms  is  known,  the  density-

normalized  mobility  for  near  thermal  electrons  depends  only  on  the  gas  temperature  T,

but not on  the gas density N.

However, the experiments have shown quite early that, even in the noble gases, the

simplest  possible  systems,  and  even  at  moderate  density,  the  mobility  significantly

deviates  from  the  classical  prediction,  Eq.  (1).  Anomalous  density  effects  have  been

experimentally  observed  in  a  number  of  compressed  gases  [2-13].  A  negative  density

effect,  i.e.,  the  density-normalized  mobility  at  thermal  energies, 

0N,  decreases  with

incresing N at constant T (and eventually drops rapidly to very low values because of the

formation  of  localized  electron  states),  is  shown  by  gases,  such  as  He  and  Ne,  whose

interaction with the excess electrons is dominated by the short-range repulsive exchange

forces. These repulsive gases are endowed with a positive scattering length a.

On  the  contrary,  a  positive  density  effect,  i.e., 

0N  increases  with  increasing  N,  is

shown  by  gases,  such  as  Ar,  whose  scattering  length  a  is  negative  because  of  the

predominant long-range, attractive polarization electron-atom interaction. In Argon, and

in the heavier noble gases, the electron mobility remains high also in the liquid and in the

crystalline  solid  phases  [14,15],  therefore  leaning  support  to  the  idea  that  electrons  in

these gases remain in extended states.

The  experimentally  observed  anomalous  density  effects  have  been  interpreted  in

terms  of  the  appearance,  at  high  density,  of  the  effects  of  multiple  scattering  as  a

consequence of two major facts: the mean free path l of electrons becomes comparable to

4

its thermal wavelength l

T  and the electron wavepacket spans over a region so large as to

contain in it several (even thousands) scatterers.

Several  multiple  scattering  theories  have  been  developed,  in  the  limit  of

vanishingly  small  electric  fields,  to  rationalize  the  experimental  observations  [17-19].

They are all based on the presence of a density-dependent quantum shift of the electron

energy in a dense disordered medium [20-22], and, for repulsive gases like Neon and He,

introduce a mobility edge. In their present form, the theories disagree more or less with

the experimental data, although the main idea of the energy shift is now well accepted.

However, the results and the analysis of accurate measurements in Ne [10,11] and

in Ar [12,13] (but also in liquid Ar [16]), two gases, whose momentum transfer scattering

cross  sections,  though  for  different  physical  reasons,  depend  strongly  on  the  electron

energy, have shown that the different behavior of the mobility in repulsive and attractive

gases can be rationalized in an unified picture, if all multiple scattering effects are taken

into account heuristically.

The heuristic model, henceforth referred to as BSL [12], has identified three main

multiple  scattering  effects  that  are  simultaneously  at  work  to  modify  the  measured

mobility with respect to the classical prediction:

a)  The density-dependent quantum shift of the electron kinetic energy;

b)  The  correlation  among  scatterers,  which  is  very  important  in  the  proximity  of

c)  An enhancement of the backscattering rate due to the quantum self-interference

of  the  electron  wavepacket  along  paths  connected  by  time-reversal  symmetry

the critical point [23];

[24,25].

5

With the choice of the proper parameters for each gas, namely the appropriate cross

section and equation of state, the heuristic BSL model does describe accurately both the

positive and negative density effect on the mobility.

This model strongly relies on the existence of the density-dependent quantum shift

of the ground state energy of excess electrons in the dense medium. However, in contrast

to the MS theories, it assumes that only the kinetic part of the shift affects the mobility in

the same way for both attractive and repulsive gases, whereas the MS theories introduce

different mechanisms of action according to the sign of the total energy shift [17-19, 25].

An other unsolved question in Ar is whether the anomalous density effect remains

positive at all temperatures. In fact, there are measurements in a restricted density range

for T 

 90 K showing that the density effect has changed to negative [26].

We have therefore carried out further mobility measurements in Ar gas in a wide

density  and  temperature  range  in  order  to  get  an  experimental  assessment  of  these  two

issues. We report here mobility measurements in Ar gas as a  function of the gas density

at three temperatures above Tc (T=152.6, 177.3, and 199.7 K) up to a maximum density

of N 

 7 nm -3 for the isotherm closest to the critical one. We also report measurements at

a temperature (T=142.6 K) below Tc up to a density N 

 3.2 nm-3.

2.  EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

We  have  used  the  well  known  pulsed  photoemission  method  as  in  our  previous

measurements  in  Ne  gas  [10]  and  we  have  exploited  the  same  experimental  apparatus

used  for  electron  drift  mobility  measurements  in  liquid  and  critical  Ar  [14].  For  details

we  refer  to  previous  papers.  We  want  to  recall  here  only  some  important  experimental

features.

6

The  production  of  photoelectrons 

is  accomplished  by 

irradiating  a  gold

photocathode  with a 1- s short UV-pulse of a Xe-flashlamp (Hamamatsu model L2435).

The lamp repetition rate has been chosen low, »

 2 – 5 Hz, in order to avoid pile up of O2

-

ions  in  the  drift  space.  The  current  induced  by  the  drifting  electrons  is  integrated  by

means  of  a  charge-sensitive  amplifier,  whose  output  is  connected  to  a  digital  storage

oscilloscope. Each signal acquisition is sent over the GPIB bus to a Personal Computer.

For  each  temperature  and  field  strength  settings,  approximately  256  signals  were

software-averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The analysis of the signal in order

to  determine  the  electron  time-of-flight  has  been  carried  out  by  exploiting  the

mathematical  methods  developed  for  the  Ne  measurements  [27].  The  induced  signal

waveform of the electron drifting at constant speed in a very pure gas sample is a straight

line, and the drift time is easily determined by the analysis of the waveform. The overall

accuracy of the mobility measurements is |

|»

 5 %.

In order to reduce the influence of O2

-  impurities on both amplitude and shape of

the  signal,  particularly  severe  at  low  field  strengths  where  the  drift  time  is  large,  great

care has been devoted to purify the gas. We used ultra-high purity Ar “60” (99.9999 % by

vol.),  further  purified  by  an  Oxisorb  filter.  We  also  used  high-temperature  bakeable

stainless  steel  tubings  and  valves.  The  impurity  concentration    is  estimated  to  be  in  the

p.p.b. range [28].

The gas pressure was measured by means of a Heise Bourdon gauge (model 710B).

The  cell  in  the  cryostat  was  thermoregulated  at  the  desired  temperature  within  – 1  mK.

The  temperature  is  measured  by  means  of  a  calibrated  PT-1001  platinum  resistor

(Lakeshore  CryotronicsInc.).  Pressure    readings  were  converted  to  density  values  by

7

using  the  equation  of  state  given  by  Tegeler  et  al.  [29].  The  estimated  error  in  the

calculated density values is <  0.5 %.

3.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We  have  carried  out  measurements  at  four  temperatures,  namely,  T=199.7,  177.3,  and

152.6  K  above  the  critical  temperature,  and  T=142.6  K,  below  it.  The  explored  density

range depends on the temperature, since the experimental cell can withstand pressures up

to 

 6.0 MPa. Therefore, the highest values of the density, N 

 7 nm-3, has been reached

at the temperature closest to the critical one.

For all densities and temperatures we have measured the drift mobilities as a function of

the  electric  field  strength  E.  It  is  customary  to  introduce  the  reduced  electric  field  E/N

because it is related to the energy that electrons gain from the field. We have investigated

a three-orders-of-magnitude range in E/N, 0.1<E/N<100 mTd (1 mTd = 10-24 Vm 2). This

range  corresponds  to  electron  energies  from  a  few  meV  (the  thermal  energy  around

T=150 K amounts to 

 20 meV) up to a few (2-3) eV.

Ramsauer-Townsend minimum at an electron energy of about 0.24 eV.

The  field  dependence  of  N  shows  the  features  typical  of  a  gas  whose  scattering  cross

section has a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum. By focusing the attention on the curve of

the lowest density in Figure 1, we note that  N is nearly constant at small fields. Then, it

9

shows  a  maximum  for  a  reduced  field  (E/N)max 

  4  mTd.  Finally,  N  decreases

approximately as (E/N)-1/2 for large values of  E/N. The mobility maximum is due to the

Ramsauer-Townsend (RT) minimum of the momentum transfer scattering cross section,

shown in Figure 2 [30,31]. The RT minimum is located at an electron energy of  RT

» 230-

240 meV. The mobility maximum appears at a value of the reduced field E/N such that

the average electron energy < > equals  RT.

By inspecting Figure 1, again, it is easily observed that the values of  N at small

fields increase with increasing density N. This is the well known positive density effect.

We also note that the position of the mobility maximum (E/N)max clearly shifts to smaller

values as the gas density increases. Since the maximum appears at the lowest densities, it

must be related to the RT minimum of the cross section even at higher densities. Its shift

to smaller values when N increases means that at higher densities less energy is required

from  the  field  for  the  mean  electron  energy  to  reach  RT.  In  some  sense,  as  it  will  be

specified later on, the environment, through the density, appears to supply an increasing,

positive contribution to the mean electron energy.

A  very  striking,  experimental  confirmation  that  the  mean  electron  energy  has  a

positive contribution from the density and that the density produces on the mean electron

energy an effect equivalent to that due to the temperature is shown in Figures 3 and 4.

In  Figure  3  we  show  the  density-normalized  mobility  N  as  a  function  of  the

reduced field for several temperatures at fixed density N  2.5 nm-3. Literature data [12] at

an intermediate temperature are also shown for comparison.

At constant density, the temperature produces several important effects on  N. On

one hand, the zero-field value, 

0N, increases with increasing T. This effect is a

temperature  and  of  the  energy  dependence  of  the  cross  section  shown  in  Figure  2.  For

energies  below  the  RT  minimum  mt  decreases  rapidly  with  energy  and  therefore  the

zero-field  mobility,  which  can  be  considered  as  a  suitable  average  of  the  inverse  cross

section  (see  Eq.  1),  increases  with  temperature.  (We  note  that  at  high  field  the

dependence on the temperature fades away and all curves drop onto a single one. This is

because at high fields the thermal contribution to the mean electron energy is negligible

with respect to the energy contributed by the electric field.)

On the other hand, we observe also that the position of the mobility maximum, (E/N)max,

in Figure 3 shifts to smaller values as the temperature increases. Again, this observation

is rationalized by noting that, at the mobility maximum, <e >» e

T increases the  thermal contribution of the mean electron energy so that less energy is

T=177.3 K  for some values of the density and compare these data with those reported in

12

Figure 3. With increasing density, at constant T, the zero-field values of  N increase, the

position  of  the  mobility  maximum  shifts  to  smaller  values,  and  all  curve  merge  into  a

single one at large E/N values. In other words, the behavior of  N  as a function of E/N is

affected in much the same way by either temperature or density.

In  some  sense,  T  and  N  can  be  interchanged  as  far  as  their  effect  on  the  electron

mobility  is  concerned.  The  obvious  conclusion  to  be  drawn  from  the  comparison  of

Figures 3 and 4 is that the density increases the average kinetic energy of the electrons by

a  positive  contribution  since 

the 

increase  of 

temperature  does 

the  same.

13

The  same  conclusion,  i.e.,  that  the  density  provides  a  positive  contribution  to  the  mean

electron kinetic energy, is drawn by inspecting the density dependence of the mobility at

near thermal energies 

0N, shown in Figure 5 for the three supercritical isotherms. In this

Figure we also show literature data for comparison. Our 

0N data at T=199.7, 177.3, and

152.6 K fit well with previous results and show the expected increase with N. We note

that, up to moderately high values of density, N 

 6 nm-3, the rate of increase of

0N  with

N decreases when the temperature is lowered toward the critical temperature. The 152.6

K isotherm represents a special case because here we have been able to reach quite large

density  values,  N 

  7  nm-3.  Further  new  measurements  at  this  temperature  up  to  N 9.5

nm-3 are presently under scrutiny but they apparently confirm the present results and, in

particular,  the  concept  of  the  density-dependent  energy  shift.  These  new  data  and  the

relative discussion, however, will be presented in detail in a subsequent publication.

The positive density effect shown by the near thermal density-normalized mobility

in Figure 5 can be rationalized by introducing the above mentioned three MS effects in

the framework of kinetic theory according to the BSL model [12]. The first effect is the

density-dependent  quantum  shift  of  the  electron  ground-state  kinetic  energy.  Clues  for

this  effect  have  been  shown  previously.  According  to  MS  theories  [20-22],  the  ground

state energy of an electron in a dense medium is shifted by a quantity V0(N) that, for Ar,

is negative. According to calculations of Springett et al. [32], V0(N) can be written as

V0(N ) = UP (N) + E k (N)                                                   (2)

UP  is a potential energy contribution arising from the screened polarization interaction of

the electron with the atoms of the environment. Ek is a kinetic energy contribution, due

essentially to excluded volume effects and from the short-range translational symmetry of

14

the  medium.  Owing  to  its  nature  of  kinetic  energy,  Ek  is  positive  and  increases  with

increasing  N,  since  the  volume  accessible  to  electrons  shrinks.  This  kinetic  energy

contribution  has  to  be  added  to  the  usual  electron  kinetic  energy    when  the  scattering

properties, namely, the cross sections, have to be calculated.

The second MS effect is due to the correlation among the scatterers, described by

the static structure factor of the gas, S(k), where k is the transferred momentum. At low

temperatures,  the  thermal  wavelength  of  the  electrons  is  so  large  as  to  encompass  a

region  containing  several  atoms.  Close  to  the  critical  point,  this  number  can  be  of  the

order  of  several  hundreds  or  thousands  of  atoms.  The  electron  wavepacket  is  then

scattered  simultaneously  by  many  scatterers  and  the  total  scattered  wavepacket  is

obtained by summing up coherently all partial scattering amplitudes contributed by each

atom [23].

The  third  MS  effect  is  an  enhancement  of  the  backscattering  rate  due  to  the

quantum  self-interference  of  the  electron  wavepacket  scattered  off  atoms  located  along

paths connected by a symmetry operation of time-reversal [24]. This phenomenon has its

analogue in the so called weak localization regime of electronic conduction in disordered

solids,  precursor  of  the  Anderson  localization  [33].  This  effect  depends  on  the  ratio

between the electron wavelength and its mean free path (l

T / l).  For Ar, in the condition

of the experiment, (l

T / l)= N mt

T <1, and to first order the cross section is enhanced by

the factor (1+ N mt

T/ ) [25].

The density-normalized mobility, in the density-modified kinetic BSL model [12],

is  then  obtained  by  inserting  these  MS  effects  in  a  heuristic  way  into  the  equation  of

classical kinetic theory. We start with the usual equation for  N [1]

The  procedure  of  the  analysis  of  the  experimental  data  with  the  previous  equations

consists in adjusting the value of Ek  until the calculated zero-field mobility agrees with

the  experimental  value  within  1%.  We  therefore  show  in  Figure  6  the  comparison

between  the  values  of  Ek  (N)  determined  by  this  fitting  procedure  and  the  prediction  of

the WS model, Eq. (8).

The comparison is shown only for two temperatures, namely T=142.6 and 199.7 K.

The  agreement  between  the  experimentally  determined  data  and  the  model  is  very

satisfactory.  The  results  for  all  other  temperatures  agree  similarly  well  up  to  highest

densities investigated on each isotherm.

These results confirm the great success of this model obtained for Ar at T=162.7 K

[12] and T=152.15 K up to densities N 7 nm-3 [13]. For larger N, it has been shown that a

positive Ek (N)  makes the model reproduce the experimental 

0N data very well but that

it deviates significantly from the WS model for N>7 nm-3. It has been therefore suggested

that  the  use  of  the  WS  model  at  such  high  densities  might  not  be  appropriate  anymore

[12,13,16].

The second question addressed in the introduction is whether the anomalous density

effect  remains  positive  at  all  temperatures,  even  below  the  critical  one.  The  question

arises  from  the  experimental  observations  [26]  that  at  T=90  K 

0N  decreases  with

increasing N for pressures up to 105 MPa.

In order to answer this question we have carried out measurements at T=142.6 K,

up to a density N 3.2 nm-3. In Figure 7 we report our experimental results for 

0N. While

the electric field dependence of  N, though not shown here, is similar to that shown in

Figure 1, including the maximum related to the RT minimum of the cross section and its

18

shift to smaller field strength as N is increased, its behavior at near thermal energies  as a

function of the density is quite different from that of the isotherms above Tc.

Figure 7. Zero-field density-normalized mobility 

0N as a function of the density N at constant

T=142.6 K,  below the critical temperature (Tc=150.86 K). The solid line is the prediction of the

heuristic BSL model.

At  this  temperature,  the  anomalous  density  effect  on 

0N  is  neither  positive  nor

negative.  For  small  densities,  up  to  N 1.3  nm-3, 

0N  increases  with  N,  but  it  shows  a

broad maximum, approximately located in the range (1<N<2) nm-3 and decreases, though

slightly, with increasing N for larger N. This is the only other experimental evidence that

the anomalous density effect in Ar is not only positive as acknowledged until now. There

is  apparently  a  crossover  between  the  density  dependence  of 

0N  at  temperatures  well

above and well below Tc . The density effect changes from positive above Tc to negative

19

well  below.  In  any  case,  the  heuristic  BSL  model  describes  accurately  this  unexpected

density  dependence  of 

0N,  as  it  is  shown  in  Figure  7.  The  solid  line  in  the  Figure  is

obtained by inserting the kinetic energy shift Ek(N), as calculated within the WS model,

Eq. (8).

Figure  8.  Density  dependence  of  the  reduced  field  at  the  mobility  maximum,  (E/N)max,  for

T=177.3 K. The circles are the experimentally determined data, the solid line is the prediction of

the  BSL  model  based  on  the  WS  calculation  of  the  quantum  shift  of  the  electron  ground  state

kinetic energy. Similar plots are obtained at all temperatures.

As  a  final  evidence  that  the  BSL  model,  with  the  strong  hypotheses  made  on  the

energy shift and on the other MS effects, does accurately describe all of the experimental

features,  we  show  in  Figure  8  the  decrease  of  the  reduced  electric  field  at  the  mobility

20

maximum, (E/N)max, as a function of the gas density. The data reported in the figure refer

to  the  177.3  K  isotherm,  but  similar  results  are  obtained  for  all  temperatures,  above  as

well as below Tc. The solid line is obtained by computing the full field dependence of  N

for  each  density  according  to  the  equations  of  the  BSL  model  and  then  locating  the

maximum in the computed curve. Again, the agreement between theory and experiment

is very satisfactory. This picture confirms the idea that less energy is required from the

electric field, when the density increases, for the mean electron energy to become equal

to the energy of the RT minimum. More explicitly, this picture once again tells that there

is a positive, density-dependent shift of the electron kinetic energy and that this shift is

satisfactorily computed from the WS model, at least up to densities N  7 nm-3 .

5. CONCLUSIONS

 The  new  mobility  data  presented  here,  measured  at  temperatures  well  above,  close  to,

and well below Tc, confirm the results obtained previously in Ar gas. The interpretation

of  the  anomalous  density  effects  arisen  from  the  previous  measurement  in  dense  Neon

and Argon gases receives strong support from these new measurements. The positive and

negative  density  effects  on  the  electron  mobility  in  dense  gases  can  now  be  described

within  an  unified  picture,  where  all  MS  and  quantum  effects  are  taken  into  account

heuristically. It is interesting to note that these measurements confirm also the fact that in

Ar  gas  the  anomalous  density  effect  does  even  change  sign  upon  lowering  the

temperature below the critical one. This confutes the old idea that the anomalous density

effect always has a direction opposite to the sign of the electron-atom scattering length.

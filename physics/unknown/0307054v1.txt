Abstract 

At high field levels, field emission losses in superconducting 

cavities have an adverse effect in both reducing the otherwise 
extremely high Q > 109 , and the magnetic breakdown field 
bringing it well below the critical magnetic field of the super-

conductor.  The two effects may well be related as field enhancing 

whiskers responsible for the field emission losses can be driven 

normal thus reducing the magnetic breakdown field.  Both the 

beneficial and deleterious effects of anodizing the inner surface of 

superconducting cavities are discussed and analyzed. 

It has been reported [1, 2] that anodic oxidation of Nb cavities leads to an 

improvement  by  a  factor  of  ~  2  in  both  the  superconducting  Q  and  Magnetic 

breakdown  field  Hp'.  Coating  the  surface  of  superconducting  cavities  with  a 

dielectric  was  proposed  both  to  reduce  field  emission  losses  and  to  protect  the 

cavity froin deleterious effects of air exposure [3]. Experiments carried out [3] to 

determine the effect on field emission of dielectric films showed that Pb whiskers 

could  grow  through  an  Al2O3  overcoating  and  vitiate  any  reduction  of  the 

electric field by the dielectric. 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

We propose that rather than merely adding to the metal a dielectric layer 

which  reduces  the  local  electric  field  by  a  factor  k  (the  dielectric  constant), 

anodization  of  niobium  converts  small  conducting  protrusions  into  dielectric 

material,  thus  vastly  reducing  or  entirely  eliminating  their  ability  to  enhance 

both electric and magnetic fields. This mechanism is especially important for the 

Martens et al. [1] cavity which was operated in the TE011 mode, with no electric 

field  on  the  cavity  surface.  Our  suggestion  [4]  has  generated  interest  in  the 

possibility  that  successive  anodization  and  stripping  of  the  oxide  may  be  a 

partial  substitute  for  the  technique  of  high-temperature  firing  of  cavities  to 

improve their Q and Hp'. This may allow the use of cheaper, lower-temperature 

processing  ovens.  We  feel  that  the  presence  of  an  anodic  dielectric  such  as 

Nb2O5, may ultimately lead to deleterious effects in a superconducting cavity. 

Since the reported work (1,2) made no mention of the loss tangent tg δ of 

Nb2O5  and  it  is  not  available  in  the  published  literature,  we  here  make  an 

upper-limit calculation. The average dielectric power loss per unit volume is

k tg δ  ~ 10-4 .  Extrapolating the data of Duffy et al. [5], k ≈  6 at 2.6 GHz

Extrapolating the data of Duffy et al. [5], k ≈  6 at 2.6 GHz  assuming no 
resonance in this region.  Therefore, for Nb2O5, tg δ  ~ 10-5 at 2.6 GHz and  

T ~ 2 K. 

 

It should be borne in mind that Nb2O5 is an ionic dielectric [6].  Because of 

the distribution of relaxation times in these materials, there is no sound basis for 

extrapolation  of  the  value  of  the  loss  tangent  calculated  above  to  considerably 

different frequencies and temperatures.  For example, the loss tangent of another 

ionic dielectric, NaCl, has been measilre [7] over, the frequency range 40 to 1000 

MHz. The loss tangent shows rapid variations with frequency and temperature. 

The 4.2K  tg δ values increase from 3.2 x 10-5 at 434 MHz to  

9.7 x 10-5 at 996 MHz. The loss tangent at, 996 MHz (9.7 x 10-5) decereases to  

5.3  x  10-5  at  2.2K  and  further  to  3.2  x  10-5  at  1.8K.  Thesc  dramatic  and  rapid 

variations  indicate  that extreme caution  should  be  used  in extrapolating  results 

obtained for Nb2O5 at 2.6 GHz and ~ 2K to other frequencies and temperatures, 

partieularly  L-band  (~1.3  GHz)  at  which  a  large  inachine  is  presently  being 

constructed. 

 

It  has  been  established  that  irradiation  of  diclectrics  [8]  can  inerease,  the 

low-temperature  value,  of  the  loss  tangent  by  a  factor  between  10  and  100. 

Oxide-coated  cavities  in  an  acclerator  would  certainly  find  themselves  in  a 

radiation  environment.    A  reduction  of  Q  by  a  factor  of  10  during  operation 

would  probably  not  be  acceptable  .  The  dielectric  with  the  lowest  loss  prior  to 

irradiation may not be the most radiation resistant. 

It  is  well  known  that,  color  centers  may  be  formed  in  dieltectrics 

irradiated  by  photons  of  enerlgy  a  few  tens  of  eV  and  higher,  as  well  as  by 

particle  bombardment.    A  color  center  is  a  lattice,  defect  (binding  a  charged 

particle), which absorbs light. Therefore (aside from radiation produced by beam 

missteering  and  accidents),  field-emitted  electrons  as  well  as  the  synchrotron 

radiation  concomitant  with  necessary  bending  of  the  electrion  beam  (as  in  a 

recirculator) will produce charge traps in many dielectrics.  The interaction of the 

bound  charge  in  these  defects  with  the  electric  field  will  greatly  increase  the 

dielectric loss as has been observed for quartz [8]. 

 

To minimize the effects of a large dielectric loss, one might be tempted to 

make  the  dielectric  thinner.  Aside  from  the  problenis  of  making  a  continuous 

dielectric  film  which  is  substantially  thinner  (30  Å  rather  than  300  Å),  one 

encounters the Malter [9], Stern, Gossling and Fowler [10] effect. If the dielectric 

charges positively (due to a secondary-electron emission coetficient greater than 

one, and/or positive ion impact), then, for thin films, the electric field across the 

layer  can  produce  copious  electron  ernission  from  the  substrate  by  a  tunneling 

process  [11].  This  is  an  additional  source  of  power  loss.  For  thick  films,  the 

electric  field  usually  does  not  build  up  to  a  higlh  enough  value  for  this  to 

happen,  but  dielectric  voltage  breakdown  or  substantial  conduction  losses  may 

occur. 

 

 

 

 

The presence of the dielectric enhances the secondary- electron emission yield 

over  that  of  the  metal,  further  increasing  the  likelihood  of  multipactoring  and 

associated problems. 

In  addition  to  reducing  field  emission,  a  dielectric  coating  on  a  cathode  may 

also  increase  the  breakdown  voltage  [3].  Jedynak  [12]  has  increased  the 

breakdown voltage by almost a factor of 2 by using dielectric films thicker than 

2000  Å  on  his  cathodes.  However,  a  dielectric  coating  on  an  anode  can  severely 

lower  the  breakdown  voltage.  For  radiofreqnency  fields,  the  net  effect  on 

breakdown  voltage  due  to  dielectric  coatings  is  yet  to  be  determined.  If  the 

coating  is  not  self-healing,  a  breakdown  which  punctures  the  dielectric  will 

generally  cause  subsequent  breakdown  at  voltages  lower  than  if  the  dielectric 

were not present at all [12]. 

Stress induced, during thermal cycling, due to lattice mismatch between 

dielectric and substrate can enhance the probability of whisker growth. As was 

observed [3] whiskers were capable of growing right through the dielectric. 

Though 

the  addition  of  a  dielectric  coating  might  possibly  be 

advantageous, unless the above effects are understood and studied, any overall 

advantageous result may turn out to be serendipitous.

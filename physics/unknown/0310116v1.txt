Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of information transfer based on Landauer’s 
principle  (i.e.  erasure  of information  is  associated  with an  increase in  entropy),  as well  as 
considerations  of  analyticity  and  causality.  We  demonstrate  that  holomorphic  functions 
allowing  complete  analytic  continuation  cannot  propagate  any  information,  such  that 
information transfer only occurs with analytic functions having points of non-analyticity (i.e. 
meromorphic functions). Such points of non-analyticity (or discontinuities) are incompatible 
with  adiabaticity, so that information transfer must always  be accompanied by  a change in 
entropy: a dynamic reformulation of Landauer’s Principle. In addition, since Brillouin proved 
that  discontinuities  cannot  travel  faster  than  the  speed  of  light  c,  this  also  implies  that 
information cannot be transferred at superluminal speeds. 
 

 

1. Introduction 
Recent  reports  of  “fast  light”,  e.g.  [1],  have  excited  interest  due  to  the  implications  for 
superluminal  data  transmission.  However,  the  theoretical  analyses  associated  with  these 
reports have neglected to include Landauer’s principle [2] and have not fully considered the 
relationship  between  entropy  and  information  in  a  complete  information-thermodynamic 
treatment. The close association of information and entropy has already been well described 
[3,4],  often  in  negative  correlation,  e.g.  Brillouin’s  concept  of  negentropy  (i.e.  negative 
entropy)  for  information  [5].  In  the  following  analysis,  we  will  demonstrate  that  proper 
inclusion  of  these  information-thermodynamic  principles  yields  both  a  more  rigorous 
definition of what we mean by information, and leads to a full retention of classical causality. 
 
Landauer's principle [2], in essence, says that the erasure of information requires energy, and 
hence is associated with an increase in entropy; whilst in contrast, information creation does 
not require energy, and is not associated with a change (e.g. decrease) in entropy. This  is a 
'static'  statement,  since  it  only  relates  to  the  erasure/creation  of  information  at  a  particular 
spatial  position.  In  this  paper,  we  apply  Landauer's  principle  to  the  'dynamic'  situation  of 
information transfer, where  information is moved  or translated  from  one  spatial  position  to 
another.  Hence,  the  mathematical  arguments  and  discussions  in  this  paper  are  directed 
towards the idea that the transfer of information from one spatial position A to another spatial 
position B is associated with a change (i.e., in general, an increase) in entropy. 
 
Sommerfeld and Brillouin pioneered the use of a step-discontinuity to analyse group velocity 
[6], and found that in any causal medium a step-front travels at the speed of light in vacuum c, 
via forerunners, such that causality is not compromised. Propagation of truncated Gaussian or 
cosine  pulses  in  a  dispersive  medium  has  also  been  extensively  analysed,  e.g.  [7-12].  In 
contrast to the step-discontinuity, such pulses allow the process of analytic continuation. It has 
been suggested that a complete temporal/frequency description of the pulse may be found in 

the leading edge of the pulse. Thus a replica of the complete pulse can be ‘carved’ out of the 
energy pedestal of the leading  edge (forerunner travelling  at  c) of  the pulse and allowed to 
propagate.  Comparing  the  spacetime  positions  of  the  centroids  of  the  initial  pulse  and  the 
transmitted  (i.e.  replica)  pulse  appears  to  indicate  a  superluminal  velocity.  This  is  an 
inappropriate comparison, however, since the replica pulse was already present in the leading 
edge of the pulse (which precedes the centroid), and which travels at c. Hence any information 
associated with the pulse was already in the forerunner that travels at a speed c (or less), and 
physical superluminal velocities do not occur.  

 

2. Differential Information and Entropy Change 
2.1 Analytic Functions & Filter Theory 
Complex  calculus  theory  has  been  extensively  applied  to  the  problem  of  group  velocity 
determination,  e.g.  [6].  However,  the  properties  of  analytic  functions  have  not  to  our 
knowledge  been  explicitly  applied  to  information  transfer.  These  functions  have  both local 
and global (i.e. distributed) properties, and obey the Cauchy-Riemann equations.  An analytic 
function  that  contains  isolated  poles  in  the  complex  plane  is  known  as  meromorphic  [13]. 
Analytic  continuation  can  be  used  to  reconstruct  a  meromorphic  function  over  the  whole 
complex plane,  except for the points of non-analyticity (poles), where the Cauchy-Riemann 
equations no longer apply. Hence, when a signal used to ‘transmit’ information from A to B 
allows  analytic  continuation  between  those  two  points,  no  information  transfer  takes  place 
between A and B, since such a signal is already completely defined at the destination point B.  
 
In  an important paper by  Toll  [14], it was  found  that  a  function,  which  is causal (i.e.  non-
anticipative) in time, has an analytic Fourier transform (FT). Its frequency components in the 
complex frequency plane are analytic and obey the Cauchy-Riemann equations. We note that 
a sufficient condition  for the analyticity of  a  function  is  that  it  obeys  the  Cauchy-Riemann 
equations [15]. An analytic function allows analytic continuation at any point in the complex 
plane  where  the  Cauchy-Riemann  conditions  hold.  Generalising  Toll’s  paper,  any  function 
that is zero from a fixed point back to minus infinity on the real axis (i.e. a ‘spatial’ causality 
or boundedness) will  have  an  analytic  FT.  This  means  that  any  ‘windowed’ or  ‘apertured’ 
function has an analytic FT. Hence, a Young’s twin-slit interference pattern, for example, is 
analytic  and  allows  for  analytic  continuation.  Likewise,  reflection  and  transmission 
coefficients  are  given  by  the  FT  of  the  finite  spatial  distribution  of  scatterers  (bounded  in 
spatial  extent)  [16],  such  that  they  too  are  analytic.  Thus  both  transverse  and  longitudinal 
grating structures scatter light analytically. Since the Maxwell equations are also an example 
of  the  Cauchy-Riemann  equations  [17], solutions  to equations  describing  wave  propagation 
through finite structures are therefore analytic. 
 
Filter  theory  has  also  been  extensively  developed  via  analytic  function  theory  to  describe 
physically  realizable  network  transfer  functions.  Two  important  tenets  are  concerned  with 
causality (non-anticipative functions) and stability. The first of these is satisfied by the Paley-
Wiener criterion [18,19], whilst  stability  is  ensured  if  the  filter  function’s  denominator  is a 
Hurwitz polynomial [18]. We now show (we believe for the first time) that these criteria must 
also define physically realizable information-bearing signals. We point out that the Gaussian 
function does not satisfy the Paley-Wiener criterion, whilst standard trigonometric functions 
fail the Hurwitz requirement by having poles in the lower-half of the complex plane.  
 
2.2 Differential Information and Complex Function Theory 
If  we  are  to  have  a  meaningful  concept  of  information  transfer,  and  therefore  associated 
spatial  differences  in  information,  that  aspect  can  only  be  described  by  the  differential 
information. The differential information (in units of bits) of a continuously-varying function 
( )p x  in space x is given by [20]:

In the infinitesimal limit of the well-known discrete summation describing information, there 
is  a  diverging  part  that  we  ignore  in  (1a).  This  is  because  when  considering  differences 
between differential informations the diverging parts cancel; the constant (infinite) divergent 
part  due  to  the  infinitesimal  limit being the same  everywhere.  Since  we are comparing the 
relative information  between two spatial  positions, A  and  B,  comparison  of  the  differential 
information at each of these two locations is therefore the meaningful metric. We assume that 
  satisfying  a  wave 
( )p x   is  the  intensity  distribution  of  a  wave  amplitude  distribution

The  products  of analytic  functions, and power series of  analytic  functions are  also  analytic 
[13],  hence  the  integrand  in  equation  (2)  can  be  analytically  continued  to  yield  a  closed 
contour integration in the complex z-plane:

conventional manner, we can express the closed contour integral as an integral along the real 
x-axis, followed by an anti-clockwise semicircular line integral W in the upper-half complex z-
plane, and let the range along the x-axis and the radius of W tend to infinity, so as to yield:

Residues are due to singularities and poles, where analytic continuation cannot be performed 
(and the Cauchy-Riemann equations do not locally hold), such that equation (5) indicates that 
the  differential  information  of  a  function  is  therefore  associated  with  these  points  of 
discontinuity. A holomorphic function allowing analytic continuation across the whole of the 
complex plane does not have any points of discontinuity, such that the sum of the residues is 
zero. Hence, according to equation (5) a holomorphic wave function contains zero differential 
information,  and  therefore  cannot  be  used  to  transmit  information  anywhere.  Only 
meromorphic  functions  (which  have  points  of  non-analyticity) have  differential  information 
associated  with  them.  The  information  associated  with a physically realizable  meromorphic 
(information-bearing)  function  is  thus  simply  given  by  the  Cauchy  residue  theorem  of 
equation  (5).  We  believe  this  to  be  a  novel  application  of  the  calculus  of  residues  to 
information  theory.  An  information-bearing  signal  must  therefore  have  points  of  non-
analyticity  [21,22],  so as not  to  allow  complete  ‘prediction’  or analytic  continuation  in the 
complex plane. We note that a point of non-analyticity cannot be a zero-order discontinuity, 
since that has finite power at infinite frequencies and hence does not fulfill the Paley-Wiener 
criterion  [23].  Since  information  is  associated  with  points  of  non-analyticity  (i.e. 
discontinuities), Brillouin’s work [6] shows that superluminal information propagation is not 
possible.  
 
2.3 Information Transfer and Entropy Change 
Landauer’s principle requires the erasure of information to be associated with an increase in 
entropy;  whilst  creation  of  information  is  not  associated  with  a  change  (e.g.  reduction)  in 
entropy. Hence, transfer of information from A to B can be understood to be the erasure of the 
information at location A (which from Landauer’s Principle is accompanied by an increase in 
entropy),  proceeded  by  the  re-creation  of  that  same  information  at  B.  Thus  transferring 
information is associated with an increase in entropy. Likewise, the points of non-analyticity 
and discontinuities associated with information are inimical to assumptions of ‘smoothness’ 
and adiabaticity in a dynamic system. Hence, information transfer must be accompanied by 
changes  in  entropy:  a  dynamic reformulation  of  Landauer’s principle.  Finally, we note that 
information  transfer  is  distinct  from  cloning  or  copying  of information  from  A  to  B.  This 
action  cannot  be  perfectly  performed  due  to  the  no-cloning  theorem  [24],  and  the 
impossibility  of  noiseless  amplification.  Both  of  these  processes  are  related  to  information 
loss and hence entropy increase; the main thrust of this paper. 
 
3. Conclusions 
In this paper we have demonstrated that information can only be carried by non-holomorphic 
functions.  The  points  of  non-analyticity  associated  with  these  functions  are  points  of 
discontinuity,  such  that  adiabatic  conditions  cannot  be  maintained  for information  transfer. 
Thus  information  transfer  must  be  accompanied  by  a  change  in  entropy:  a  dynamic 
reformulation  of  Landauer’s  principle.  Points  of  non-analyticity  and  discontinuities,  i.e. 
information, cannot travel faster than c in any medium, thus maintaining causality.

Abstract 

 

 

This paper has pedagogical motivation.  It is not uncommon that students have great difficulty in 
accepting the new concepts of standard special relativity, since these seem contrary to common 
sense. Experience shows that geometrical or graphically exposition of the basic ideas of relativity 
theory  improves  student’s  understanding  of  the  algebraic  expressions  of  the  theory.  What  we 
suggest here may complement standard textbook approaches. 
 
 

I - Spacetime Diagram 
 

postulates 1: 

the observer motions. 

The  two  pillars  of  Einstein’s  special  relativity  theory  are  the  following  two 

1) All  laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames;  
2) In empty space, light travels with constant speed c independent of the source or 

Any physical phenomenon takes place at a space position and at a certain time. To 
characterize  this  “event”  we  need  to  know  the  spatial  and  time  coordinates  in  a  four 
dimensional  spacetime,  as  one  usually  refers  to  the  set  of  all  possible  events.  In  such 
spacetime,  an  event  is  a  point  with  coordinates  (x,y,z,t)  or  as  most  conventionally  used 
(x,y,z,ct), the c being the absolute value of light speed in free space∗.  

One given event has different coordinates depending on the reference system one 
is  adopting.  Special  relativity  deals  with  the  transformation  of  the  set  of  coordinates  of 
any  event  in  a  given  inertial  frame  into  another  set  in  any  other  inertial  frame.  The 
observers  can  measure  space  distances  with  measuring-rods  and  time  with  measuring-
clocks. Both rods and clocks are assumed to be in all respects alike. 

Minkowski  spacetime  diagram2  is  a  graphical  representation  of  events  and 
sequences  of  events  in  spacetime  as  “seen”  by  observer  at  rest.  Such  sequences  are 
named  wordlines.  A  two-dimensional  spacetime  example  is  given  in  Figure  1,  where  x 
and ct are the two coordinates. A light ray emitted at the origin along the x-axis towards 
positive  values  of  x  in  space  is  represented  by  a  straight  line  ct  =  x  (OW).  You  should 
notice  that  OW    bisects  the  quadrant  formed  by  ct-axis  and  x-axis);  GH  (ct  =  -x) 
represents  a  light  ray  emitted  at  the  origin  traveling  along  the  x-axis  towards  negative 
values of x; OP represents anything traveling with moderate constant speed as compared 
to c ; the slope  of the  worldline gives a measure of the speed; OQ  represents anything 
traveling  with  constant  speed  close  to  that  of  light;  IJ  represents  events  happening 
simultaneously;  The  ct-axis  itself  represents  anything  standing  still  at  point  O  (x,ct  )  = 

                                                 
∗ The exact speed of light, in vacuum, is 2.99792458 x 108  km/s.

(0,ct);  the  x-axis  represents  simultaneous  events  at  (x,ct)=(x,0)  (you  may  understand  
them  as  occurring    “now”).    The  light  worldline  is  called  lightline.  The  locus  of  all 
lightlines  starting  at  the  origin  constitutes  a  light  cone,  as  shown  in  Figure  2  for  three-
dimensional spacetime. In two dimensions, as shown in Figure 1, GOW constitutes a light 
“cone”.  Although real physical phenomenon happens in four dimensional spacetime, one 
usually  stick  with  the  two-dimensional  representation  because  most  of  what  can  be 
deduced from Minkowski diagrams can be done in this simple scenario.

The  circles  centered  at  ct-axis  define  simultaneity

represented on a piece of paper. However most of the

two and three dimensional spacetimes. 

effects  between

in 

 
Let  two  inertial  reference  frames  named  K  =  K(x,ct)  and  K’  =  K’(x’,ct’)  have 
 
rectilinear uniform relative motion, with speed V. For simplicity we will keep considering 
two-dimensional spacetime only.

Suppose now that you, the reader, are in the inertial frame K, at its spatial origin 
(x,ct) = (0,ct) and some friend of yours is in K’,  also at its origin (x’,ct’) = (0,ct’) which 
moves  away  with  speed  V,  along  x-axis.    You  may  consider  yourself      to  be  in  a 
“stationary”  frame  while  your  friend  is  in  “non-stationary”  frame.  Since  K    and  K’  are 
both  inertial  frames,  your  friend  may  also,  by  himself,  consider  to  be  in  a  “stationary” 
frame, and judge that you are in a “non-stationary” inertial frame.  

Assume that both K and K’ are coincident at (x,ct) = (0,0) = (x’,ct’). 
As  you  have  seen  in  Figure  1,  the  line  which  represents  the  light  ray  going  to 
right, from the origin, bisects the angle between ct-axis and x-axis. In Figure 3 both K and 
K’  are  drawn  according  to  the  viewpoint  of  the  observer  in  K  (you).  An  arbitrary  point 
event E is also represented in the diagram and has coordinates (xE,ctE) in K  and (x’E,ct’E) 
in K’. The angle θ, shown in the Figure 3, indicates the speed of K’ relative to K (tan(θ) = 
V/c).  Such  an  event  E  and  any  other  event  with  the  same  time  coordinate  ctE  are 
considered simultaneous in K.  Event E and any other event with the same coordinate ct’E 
are  simultaneous  in  K’.  So  simultaneity  is  not  an  absolute  concept,  on  the  contrary, 
simultaneity is relative; the judgments of simultaneity of events will vary according to the 
state  of  motion  of  the  observer.  We  should  mention  also  that  all  the  clocks  at  rest  in  a 
given inertial frame should be considered synchronized 1. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure  3  –  Both  inertial  reference 
frames  K  and  K’  are  shown.  As 
“seen” in frame K, the event E has 
ctE  and  xE  coordinates.  As  “seen” 
in  frame  K’  the  event  E  has  ct’E 
and  x’E  coordinates;  tan(θ)  =  V/c, 
where  V  is  the  speed  with  which  
K’  is receding from K. 

 
At this point you might be questioning if Minkowski spacetime is Euclidean. It is 
not.  In  two-dimensional  spacetime  diagram,  a  Minkowski  space  is  represented  on  a 
Euclidean  plane  (sheet  of  paper)  because  the  points  in  the  Euclidean  plane  (events  in 
spacetime) are labeled by pairs of real numbers (one for space and one for time).

Since  Minkowski  spacetime  is  not  Euclidean,  you  cannot  use  the  Pythagorean 
theorem in its familiar (Euclidean) form to calculate physical properties from Minkowski 
diagram. Later on in this paper you will find the substitute for such theorem. 

All the events inside the lightcone centered at O belong to the future of O (ct>0 
and  |V|<c).  Obviously  the  lightcone  has  its  counterpart  on  the  negative  side  of  ct-axis 
(ct<0 and |V|<c); it embodies all events which belong to the past of O. All region outside 
the lightcone is inaccessible to O (|V|>c). You may call it elsewhere. 
 

in  K.  The 

 
 
Figure 4 – Here the inertial frame K’, moving 
with  constant  speed  V<c    to  the  right,  is 
represented  as  “seen” 
initial 
conditions are (x,ct) = (0,0) = (x’,ct’). A light 
source at the spatial origin in K emits a pulse 
towards  K’  where exists a mirror  that reflects 
it  back.  Your  clock  says  that  the    pulse  is 
emitted  at  event  (0,  cT1)  and  is  back  at  event 
(0,  cT2).    According  the  postulate  of  constant 
that  cT  = 
light  one  can  get 
speed  of 
(cT2+cT1)/2.  Events    (0,cT)  and  (0,cT’)  are 
simultaneous in K.  
 

 
 
II - Doppler Factor  
 

 

Consider  now  the  Figure  4  in  which  K’,  moving  with  constant  speed  V  to  the 
right, is represented as “seen” in K. The initial conditions are the same as before (x,ct) = 
(0,0) = (x’,ct’). Suppose you (in K) have a light source at the origin which emits a pulse 
towards K’ (your friend) where exists a mirror that reflects it back. Your clock says that 
the  pulse is emitted at event (0, cT1) and is back at event (0, cT2).  From Figure 4 you can 
get that the event (0,cT) where

is  simultaneous  to  the  event  (0,cT’  ),  in  K’,  at  which  the  pulse  is  reflected.  It  worth 
mentioning that cT’ is

The event (0,cT1) at which the light ray is emitted is arbitrary;  the ratios cT2/cT’ and

III - Time Dilation 
 

The  light  ray  that  leaves  the  origin  of  your  frame  K  at  event  (0,  cT1)    hits  the 
mirror at (x=β cT, cT),  according to K .   For your friend (in K’) such event occurs  at 
(x’=0,cT’).  We  want  to  know  the  relation  between  cT  and  cT’,  elapsed  time  since  the 
common  origin  according  to  K  and  K’,  respectively.  From  expressions  (4)  and  (7)  it

where

                                                                          (12) 

Since γ > 1 you conclude that cT > cT’ which means that time flows slower for K’.  

 
The elapsed time measured by a clock at rest is  called a proper time. Then time 
cT’  measured  by  the  clock  in  K’  at  the  same  spatial  position  (x’=0)  is  called  a  proper 
time. 

IV - Length Contraction 

 
Let a rod be at rest in K   and let its length to be known by applying the standard 
measuring-rod as many times as necessary.  Let such length be L0   - the proper length - 
according to your inertial frame K. The proper length is the measured length of anything 
which is at rest in a given inertial frame. Let a light source be placed at the left end of the 
rod and a mirror  at the right end. The mirror is  placed in such way that  it reflects back 
any  ray  coming  from  the  other  end  of  the  rod.  The  rod  is  at  rest  in  K  and  its  left  end 
coincides with the origin, and  you have a standard clock at the light source position, so 
you are able to measure the time a light ray spends along the rod to go and come back to 
the starting point position. Suppose you measure the elapsed time and call it 2T0.  Since 
the  speed  of  light  is  constant  no  matter  the  direction  it  goes,  according  to  Einstein’s 
principle, you may say that L0 = cT0. 

Now  suppose  this  same  rod  appears  to  be  at  rest  in  K’.    The  rod  length,  as 
measured by your friend in K’ in which it is at rest, is L’0.  As before the rod has the left 
end at (x’,ct’) = (0,ct’)  and the right end at  (x’,ct’) = (L’0 , ct’). 

In  Figure  5  the  rod  which  is  along  x-axis  (and  x’-axis)  is  represented  by  the 
double line segment with length labeled L’0 between O’ and A points and is seen to be at 
rest in K’.  The light ray emitted at the common origin of both frames moves along x-axis 
(and x’-axis) and reaches the right end of the rod at point event Q which has coordinates 
(x,ct)=(L02 ,cTR) in your frame K.  The spatial distance traveled by light to reach the right 
end of the rod is OB = ctR, as measured in  K,

Figure  5  –  Inertial  frame  K’, 
moving  with  constant  speed  V<c  
to  the  right,  is  represented  as 
“seen” in K. The initial conditions 
are  (x,ct)  =  (0,0)  =  (x’,ct’).  A  rod 
which is along x-axis (and x’-axis) 
is  represented  by  the  double  line 
segment  with  length  labeled  L’0 
between  O’  and  A  points  and  is 
seen to be at rest in K’. Its left end 
is at (x’,ct’) = (0,ct’)  and the right 
end at  (x’,ct’) = (L’0 , ct’). A  light 
ray  emitted  at  the  common  origin 
of    both  frames  moves  along  x-
axis  (and  x’-axis)  and  reaches  the 
right  end  of  the  rod  at  event  Q 
(x,ct)=(OB,cTR), according to K.  
 

 

 

 
According to your friend (in K’) the time the light ray spent from the left end to the right 
end of the rod is cT’0.  From equation (10) you calculate that 
 
 
 
is  the  time  you  judge  that  the  mirror  at  the  right end  of  the  rod  reflects  back  the  pulse. 
You do not have a direct measure of such time since your clock is at origin of K. But you 
can  have  a  direct  measure  of  the  full  back  and  forth  time  light  spent    (  2cTR).  Then 

                                                                              (14)

is the length the moving rod  appears to have (L<L0). This is the length contraction effect 
predicted by special relativity. 

In  a  recent  paper  3,  one  of  us  used  two  rods  to  prove  the  relativistic  length 
contraction (expression 17). The scenario is similar to the one shown in Figure 5: one rod 
has proper length L01 (equal to ours L0) which is moving to the right with speed V and a 
second rod, at rest, with proper length L02. A light ray is emitted at the origin when both 
left ends coincide. Such light ray is expected to meet coincidently both rod’s right ends. 
This triple meeting only occurs if L02 is equal to distance OB in our Figure 5. That means 
L02 = k L01. So one sentence is missing in that paper, such as “The proper length of both 
rods should be such that their right ends and the light ray meet at the same point in time, 
which means L02 = k L01 where k = ((1+V/c)/(1-V/c))1/2  is Doppler factor.” 
 
 
V - Addition of Velocities 
 

It is interesting to notice that the Doppler factor enables  us to derive the addition 
of velocities expression in a quite straight work. Let three inertial frames K, K1 and K2, 
which clocks were all synchronized at the common origin. Let V1 and V2  be the velocities 
of K1 and K2  with respect to K.

Figure  6  –  K1  and  K2  are  inertial  reference 
frames  traveling  along  x-axis  with  speeds 
(velocities)  V1  and  V2  with  respect  to  K. 
Imagine a light ray emitted in K at (0,ct) which 
reaches K1 at (0,ct1) and K2 at (0,ct2). Knowing 
that  (ct1/ct)  =  k1  and  (ct2/ct)  =  k2  one  gets 
(ct2/ct1)  =  k12  =  k1k2,  from  which  follows  the 
expression for addition of speeds or velocities.

where s does not depend upon which inertial frame one is dealing with, independs on the 
observer, it is invariant. 
 

 
 
 
Figure 7 – A light ray is emitted at (0,ct1) 
in  K,  reaches  K’  at  (0,ct1’)  and  then  is 
reflected  back  at  (x,ct)  according  to  K.  In 
returnig to the spatial origin in K it crosses 
K’  at  (0,ct2’)  and  then  hits  back  to  K  at 
(0,ct2);    ct  is  the  midpoint  between ct1  and 
ct2, and is simultaneous with P in K; ct’ is 
also the midpoint between ct1’ and ct2’ and 
is simultaneous to P in K’.  

 

 
It  should  be  clear  that  when  one  talks  about  coordinates  of  a  given  event  E  in 
spacetime one actually is dealing with two events: event E = (x,ct) and event origin O = 
(0,0). Very commonly one considers the observer at rest at the origin, or, the origin at the 
observer. Then one can write, with no loss of generality that

The  quantity  ∆s  is  called  spacetime  interval  and  it  is  an  invariant  in  special 
relativity. If one were talking about Euclidean space this would play the rolle of distance 
between  two  points.  If  spacetime  were  Euclidean  one  would  calculate  such  interval  as 
(c2∆t2  +  ∆x2),  by  using  the  Pythagorean  theorem.    So  here  there  is  a  critical  difference 
between Euclidean space and spacetime: “Pythagorean thorem” is much different here.  

 
There  is  a  good  paradigm  for  a  proper  time,  which  is  the  time  your  wristwatch 
shows,  assuming  of  course  that  it  is  at  rest  relative  to  you.  It  is  common  among  the 
physicists to refer to proper time by the greek letter τ. Then for ∆x’ = 0, ∆τ = ∆t’   you 
have:

You  can  easily  see  that ∆s2  =  c2∆τ2  (or  ds2  =  c2dτ2)  can  be  greater  than  zero,  equal  to 
zero  or  less  than  zero.  In  the  first  case  (∆s2  >  0)  the  spacetime  interval  is  said  to  be 
“timelike”;  in  the  second  case  (∆s2    =  0)  it  is  “lightlike”;  the  last  case  (∆s2  <  0)  the 
spacetime  interval  is  said  to  be  “spacelike”.  This  spacetime  interval  is  an  important 
quantity in further studies in relativity.

VIII – Calibrating Minkowski Diagram 
 

At this point one should talk about calibration of spacetime diagram. The ct-axis 
and x-axis in all diagrams we have been using in this paper are already calibrated, as one 
tacitly  assumed;  the  units  of ct  and  x  are  assumed  to  be  the  same  as  it  naturally  results 
from  the  choice  of  coordinates  (x,ct).  They  both  have  dimensions  of  distance.  This 
actually is a reflex of the interdependence of space and time.  

 

11 

If  spacetime  were  Euclidean  one  would  draw  a  diagram  as  the  one  shown  in 
Figure  8  and  the  calibration  would  be  done  through  the  use  of  circles  (c2t2  +  x2  =  n2), 
centered  at  the  origin,  where  n  are  integer  numbers.  The  calibrating  circles  define  the 
locus of all points whose distance from the origin is multiple of the unit.  
 
 
 
Figure 8 – Spacetime is not Euclidean, 
but if it were one would draw a diagram 
as 
the 
the  one  shown  here  and 
calibration  would  be  done  through  the 
use  of  circles  (c2t2  +  x2 =  n2),  centered 
at  the  origin,  where  n  are  integer 
numbers.  The  calibrating  circles  define 
the  locus  of  all  points  whose  distance 
from the origin is multiple of the unit 

Spacetime  is  not  Euclidean  and  in  order  to  do  the  calibration  one  has  to  use 
calibrating hyperbolas (c2t2 - x2 = ±n2), with n being integer numbers. You have seen that  
∆s2 = c2∆τ2 can be positive, null or positive, and this explains the ± signs in the hyperbola 
equations. In Figure 9 you can see the spacetime diagram with the calibrating hyperbolas 
(two branches for n = 1 and two branches for n = 2).   

Let us consider the  case for which ∆s2 =  +1. The 1 on  ct-axis defines the event 
(x,ct) = (0,1) in reference frame K (you). Along the same hyperbola (∆s2 = +1), the 1 on 
ct’-axis defines the event (x’,ct’) = (0,1) in K’ (your friend).   You can promptly see that 
while the time is ∆t = 1, in accord to K, in K’ the time should be ∆t’ < 1. This just the 
time dilation phenomenon: ∆t = 1 = γ ∆t’, ∆t’  = 1/γ < 1. So time flows slower for K’, 
under the viewpoint of K. A symmetrical situation occurs for the observer in K’. To him 
while  his  clock  is  showing ∆t’  =  1,  following  K’  simultaneity  line,  you  would  find  out 
that your clock shows ∆t < 1. This just the same time dilation phenomenon as “seen” by 
the observer in K’; ∆t’  = 1  = γ ∆t, ∆t  = 1/γ  <  1. So time flows slower  for K, which is 
receding with speed –V under the viewpoint of K’.  
Now  the  case  for  which ∆s2  =  -  1.  The  1  on  x-axis  defines  the  event  (x,ct)  =  (1,0)  in 
reference  frame K  (you).  Along  the  same  hyperbola  (∆s2 =  -1),  the  1  on x’-axis  defines 
the event (1,0) in K’ (your friend).   You can promptly see that the length ∆x = 1  (at ∆t  
= 0) in K should be, according to K’, ∆x’ = 1/γ  < 1. So a unit length in frame K is “seen” 
as less than unit length in frame K’. This is the phenomenon of length contraction. Again 
here a symmetrical situation occurs. The 1 on x’-axis defines the event (x’,ct) = (1,0) in 
reference  frame  K’  (your  friend).  Along  the  same  hyperbola  (∆s2  =  -1),  the  1  on  x-axis 
defines the event (1,0) in K (you). While ∆x’ = 1 in K’, you find out that the same length 

 

 

 

12 

in  K  should  be  smaller  (∆x  =  1/γ    <  1);  just  follow  the  equilocality  line  (same  spatial 
position according to K’) starting from (x’,ct’) = (1,ct’).   

 

 
 
Figure  9  –  Spacetime 
diagram  is  calibrated 
by  using  calibrating 
hyperbolas  (c2t2  -  x2  = 
±n2),  with  n  being 
integer  numbers.  Here 
two  
draws 
one 
hyperbolas  (for  n  =  1 
and  n  =  2).    One  can 
see quite clear, at least 
qualitatively,  the  time 
dilation  and  the  length 
contraction  properties 
and  their  symmetrical 
aspects. 
 

 

 
 
Conclusion 
 
Starting with Minkowski diagram we get Doppler k-factor, time dilation, length 
contraction, addition of velocities, invariant spacetime  interval and Lorentz 
Transformations. Hope this approach may be useful in complementing standard 
textbooks on special relativity.

A  combined  method  for  analyzing  quantum  dynamical  equations which  uses  the  Bohmian  mechanics  and  the  quantum 
phase  space  representation  is  proposed.  It  is  based  on  a  presentation  of  the  wave  function  in  phase  space  in  a  polar  form.  The 
combined method is very effective for comparison of classical and quantum dynamics for polynomial potentials of order no higher 
than second. Application for the harmonic oscillator and quartic double well potential is performed. Quantum fluxes and particle 
energy are derived by means of the proposed method. 

Introduction 

 

Governing  processes  in  the  microworld,  quantum 
mechanics appears as an exact theory  which provides full 
information  about  microsystem.  But  even  at  present  time 
of  powerful  calculating-machines  it  cannot  be  employed 
successfully  for  the  realistic  many-dimensional  systems 
due  to  numerical  difficulties  arisen  from  dealing  with 
matrices  of  a  big  size.  Therefore  classical-quantum 
correspondence  is  one  of  the  central  problem  in  modern 
physics. In current paper we consider only two approaches 
widely used for its handling. 

form 

[1].  Then 

The first approach is a Bohmian mechanics (BM) or 
hydrodynamic 
formulation  of  quantum  mechanics. 
According to the BM the wave function is represented in a 
polar 
the  Schroedinger  equation 
decomposes  into  two  parts:  an  analogue  of  the  classical 
Hamilton-Jacobi 
probability 
conservation  equation.  Quantum  effects  are  included  into 
an  additional  term  in  the  HJ  equation,  called  quantum 
potential. The presence of the latter gives rise to a problem 
associated with numerical difficulties of its calculation.  

equation 

(HJ) 

and 

The  second  approach  is  a  quantum  phase  space 
representation  (QPSR).  Due  to  the  uncertainty  principle 
there exists a variety of them. It is hard to pick out one as 
ideal  because  each  approach  has  its  advantages  and 
disadvantages. In current work we do not pursue an aim to 
characterize them and will consider only one, proposed by 
Go.Torres-Vega  and  Frederick  [2].  The  main  idea  of  it  is 
to formulate a definition of coordinate  Qˆ  and  momentum 
Pˆ   operators  in  phase  space  in  a  way  the  uncertainty 
principle is satisfied. From that operators the Hamiltonian 
operator 
time-dependent 
Schroedinger  equation  in  phase  space  which  governs  the 
wave  function  dependent  on  momentum  and  coordinate 
simultaneously can be derived. Both BM and QPSR are as 
learning  of  classical-quantum

correspondence rather than a simulation tool. However, the 
quantum  trajectory  method  based  on  direct  integration  of

CM formulation 
 

Despite  of  diversity  of  both  methods  we  propose  a 
combined  method  (CM)  based  on  the  BM  and  QPSR.  The

 is determined by 
The form of 
specifying the potential. Equation (3) can be considered as 
an  analogue  of  the  classical  HJ  equation  and  (4)  as  a 
quantum  Liouville  equation.  Unlike  BM,  they  include 
additional  terms  due  to  dependence  of  amplitude  R  and 
phase S on p and q. 
 
It  can  be  shown  that  for  any  polynomial  potential 
parameters V and G are reduced to a form containing only 
P, Q (not p,q) and their derivatives with respect to p and q. 
Moreover, as concluded from (4)

i.e., the quantum fluxes are derived automatically  without

We have to admit that our approach suffers from an 
obvious  shortcoming  associated  with  presence  of  high 
order  momentum  derivatives  in  equations.  The  similar 
inconvenience  is  typical  for  momentum  representation  in 
quantum mechanics.  
 
 

Harmonic oscillator potential 

 
 
The  CM  is  especially  effective  in  description  for 
polynomial potentials of order no higher than second. We 
demonstrate  it  for  the  harmonic  potential  with

a quantum potential as in the BM because its derivatives are 
included in both equations.  
 
An  interesting  point  is  to  study  the  behavior  of 
quantum trajectories. The Gaussian wave packet is the best 
choice as initial state because there exists an exact analytical 
solution. According to [2]

It is not possible to derive from (21)-(22) equations similar 
to (11)-(12) as in case of the harmonic oscillator potential. 
But  from  (23)  one  can  still  construct  equations  for 
quantum  trajectories  and  integrate  them  numerically.  The 
tunneling  path  between  the  wells  can  be  studied  in  this 
way [6]. 
 

Summary 

 
 
In  this  paper,  we  have  introduced  a  method  which 
combines the Bohmian mechanics and the quantum phase 
space  representation.  Being  combined,  it  absorbs  some 
advantages and disadvantages of both of them as well. The 
 

is 

for 

the 

tool 

a  better 

classical-quantum 
CM 
correspondence  than  the  BM  and  QPSR  individually.  It 
generates the quantum Liouville equation automatically and 
allows to introduce the quantum particle energy as negative 
time derivative of phase. An obvious drawback of the CM is 
an  appearance  of  cumbersome  equations  for  high  order 
potential.  However,  using  the  similar  routine  from  the  BM 
which  consist  in  numerical  integration  of  the  Schroedinger 
equation and then recovering  the amplitude and phase, one 
can  obtain  the  quantum  fluxes  required  to  derive  quantum 
trajectories in phase space.

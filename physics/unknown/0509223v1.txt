ABSTRACT 
      
     The physics of wavefunction “collapse” from Hilbert space to a classically real 

spacetime,  accompanied  by  wave-particle  duality,  is,  fundamentally,  “reduction” 

of the complex psi to reality.  We introduce new terminology for new physics. 

     The superposition s

 ~ y

 + f   of system and apparatus is postulated.    

     A simple and obvious thing to test is the ensemble probability (Sect. 1). 

     Weinberg  (2005)  suggests  three  types  of  experiments  for  energy,  position, 

and momentum observable ensemble averages which should all be tested (Sect. 

2  -  4).    This  Reference  is  intended  to  serve  as  general  background  for  the 

present paper which is self-contained.

      We  introduce  and  use  throughout  this  paper  the    phrase  “redox  of  the 

wavefunction”,  choosing 

this  over 

traditional  Copenhagen 

interpretation 

“collapse-reduction  of  the  wavefunction”.    (see  Addendum  for  coining  of  this 

term)                                                                                                        

PREFACE 

 

 

SECTION 1.  ENSEMBLE PROBABILITY.  In this Section, we develop the first of 

four experiments, in principle, to test the Artscience interpretation (hereinafter  

AS ; Ref. 1).  To begin, we define a probability density 

P ( x i, t )  =    s  ( x i , t ) 

                                                 ”   (1/C)  y  +  f 

  2         

                             Eq. (1) 

for   

 

  a  system    wavefunction, 

 

 

 

y  =  y 

(  x  i  ,  t  )    ,    and  a  detector 

wavefunction,  f  =  f 

( x i, t )  , both normalized.  The spatial coordinate index  i = 

1,  2,  3      in      D  =  3  +  1      spacetime  dimensions.    The  superposition  s

  is  also 

normalized by the constant  C. 

     In analogy  to Ref.1 [Eqs. (3) and  (5) therein], we let 

               

 

 ( t )  =  V ∫ P d3x     ,                                                  Eq. (2) 

which  is  the  probability  of  finding  a  “redoxed”  state  of    s 

in  volume  V  at  time  t.  

One  subtlety,  which  we  will  treat    in  this  Section,    is  that  we  cannot  possibly 

expect  the  whole  detector  to  redox  in  volume  V.    This  takes  additional 

interpretation and introduction of what we shall call an f-factor (Sect. 3). 

P

     To continue, with time-dependence implicit, we write out  Eq. (2) : 

      

 

P    =  (1/C)  V  ∫  (  y  2  +  f

* y  +  y

* f   +  

f  2 )  d3x       .   Eq. (3) 

It is predicted that an ensemble-type experiment will measure this. 

     Including normalization in the denominator explicitly  

       P  =     _______________________         ,                     Eq. (4) 

                                                 y  2  +   f
     
 
                            
                                              ∫  ( y   2  +   f

terms  

“observation-created” as in the Copenhagen interpretation, i.e., an experimental 

“contextual reality”.  (see Ref. 1) 

     In  Eq.  (4),    the  probability  density,  P  ,  does  not  vanish  if    f

ﬁ 0 

or  in  some 

sense  becomes small, perhaps an unphysical limit.  In the numerator, a change 

in    f

terms, e.g.,  if  we  “tune”    the  apparatus,  does  not  affect     y  2   

.    Even 

changing  the  denominator-normalization,  the  functional  form  of    y

    is  not 

metaphysically “created” by  f . 

     This may be checked with an ensemble test of Eq. (3). 

     We note that the  f  2  

term

 
has to be zeroed-out in calibrating the apparatus. 

      Let us take a detailed look at what happens. 

 

 

SECTION 1a. DISCUSSION.  We next define two integrals containing  f ,   called  

I and J  [Eqs. (5) and (8) below, resp.].

     In  Eq.  (3),  the  mathematics  (formalism)  is  alright,  but  the  interpretation  is 

somewhat  subtle.  Let   l

  be the deBroglie wavelength of the detector.  For the 

limit   V  <  l

 3   ,  the the whole detector does not redox in V.  We will only find a 

part or “fraction” of it occupying V.  ( V >l

 3   is an unphysical  measurement) 

     Firstly, we define the integral (taken from Eq. (3)) 

  

 

 

I ”   (1/C)   V  ∫ ( f

* y + y

* f   )  

d3x      .                          Eq. (5) 

The  range  V    <      l

  3    is  consistent  with  the  system  being  smaller  than  the 

     The  detection  of      I    over    V    is  effected  by    f   ,  effectively  a  probability 

amplitude  of    the  fraction  of  the  detector  as  a  matter-wave  that  occupies  the 

volume.  For  a matter-wave ( l

 ) ,  we expect intuitively that the fraction obtains 

detector. 

as 

 

 

 

I  (cid:181)

  V /  l 3       .                                                                                 Eq. (6) 

While  y

  redoxes, f -fraction detects it , and although  this argument is only semi-

quantitative, Eq. (3) remains the prediction for an experiment (Sect. 1). 

    We  perform  a  more  detailed  dimensional  analysis  of  Eq.  (5)    with  the 

assumption that  y

 ~ l 1 -3 / 2   and  f  ~ l 2 -3 / 2  , where l 1  is the system deBroglie 

wavelength, l 2  ”  l , and thus 

where the factor  

 

 

 

 

I  (cid:181)

  f V / (l 1 l 2 ) 3 / 2        ,                                                          Eq. (7a) 

f = (l 1 / l 2 ) 3 / 2                                                            Eq. (7b)

if  Eq.  (6)  is  accurate.    There  must  be  this    additional  factor  of    f    ,  and  we  can 

show where it comes from now. 

     As mentioned above, a second integral (also from Eq. (3)) is given by 

 

 

J  ”   (1/C)   V ∫  f  2  d3x      .                                                Eq. (8) 

J  is  to  be  zeroed-out  in  calibration  of  the  apparatus.    However,  J  does  in  fact 

dimensionally go like  J ~ V /  l 3  ,  which substantiates the f-factor. 

     Dimensionally,    I-type  redox  is    related  to  J-redox  including  the  system    and 

an f-factor .   

      It may turn out than Eq. (6) is an over-simplification: A detailed model for this 

would be useful.  We still assume Eq. (5) in the remainder of this paper. 

SECTION 2. ENERGY ENSEMBLE AVERAGE.  An energy  experimental test of 

the AS interpretation is next.  The equation for the energy variable (observable) 

ensemble average with Hamiltonian operator Hop  ”   H (x i, pi , t) op    is   

 

 

< E >s    =  ∫ s * Hop   s

 d3x     ,                                        Eq. (9) 

integrating  over  all  space  (cf.    Eq.  (14b)  below).  A    ‘subscript  s

’    indicates  the 

superposition. 

     Eq.  (9)  is  one  case  of  the  dynamical  variable  ensemble  average,  the  main 

result of Ref. 1.  N.B.:  When in brackets < V >  ,  V  is a variable and not volume, 

which occurs only in Eq. (10a). The result  [cf. Eq. (8) in Ref. 1]  is 

 

 

 

< V >  =  ∫ O (x i, t )  d3x       ,                                    Eq. (10a)                                    

 

 

 

the variable, gives 

 

 

 

 

integrating  over  all  space,  where    the    Hermitian  operator  ,  O ,    associated  with 

6 

O (x i, t )   ”   s * O  s

      .                                           Eq. (10b) 

     The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle  gives us insights into a test of Eq. (9) 

by writing the uncertainty in time as 

t  ‡   h  /  2 D Es

         .                                                                 Eq. (11) 

The notation  D Es

 denotes the usual uncertainty formula calculated with  s

.   The 

precise value  of   D

t  is not of importance in principle; we only  need < E >s

 from 

experiment  to prove AS correct.  We should observe redox at a time t ~ D

t  for 

large D

t .  (Another experiment for small D

t should measure a time t  > D

t.) 

     An interesting quantity to look at is 

 

 

 

  ”    D Es

 D

t  +  (D E  D T)disturb

       ,                               Eq. (12) 

assuming  that  the  uncertainties  add  (qualitatively).    The  second  term  is  for  the 

disturbed system (at redox),  and T is a time parameter  defined by  T = t - t   ,  

measured  from  redox  (physical  reality)    at    t  =  t     .    The  initial  state  has  been 

prepared at  t = 0  (if appropriate to the experiment).  

     We easily see that 

 

 

 

  ‡   h       ,                                                                  Eq. (13) 

which  has  been  derived  by  applying  the  uncertainty  principle  twice,  once 

including the system and apparatus  (the first term of Eq. (12)), and secondly at 

redox (T = 0), to the disturbed system (second term). 

D
h

7 

     Are we including the system twice?  The answer is no, because the term  in 

Eq. (12) containing D

t  is to be looked at as an initial condition for the disturbance 

of the system.  The uncertainty of the detector  is neglible following redox if there 

is  non-mutual  disturbance.    If  states  y

  and  f   mutually  disturb  each  other,  then 

there would be a third term in Eq. (12). 

     We  would  like  to  discuss  the  integral  analogous  to  I  but  appropriate  to  this 

Section, for the Hamiltonian operator, i.e.,   

 (1/C) V  ∫ (f

*   Hop  y   +  y

* 

Hop f)    d3x       ,             Eq. (14a) 

 

 

 

where 

 

 

 

 

Hop = - ( h  2  / 2 m

  )  (cid:209)

 2    +  coupling  P.E.     ,        Eq. (14b) 

and  we  have  to  put  in  by  hand  masses  m

  =  m1  or  m2  .    Coupling  P.E.  is  the 

potential energy,  F

( x i, t ) , and  F

 s

  is  F 2  y

   +  F 1  f   (see Eq. (9)) .  We 

have assumed weak coupling  for simplicity.  For a time-dependent Schrodinger 

equation Hop = (h/ i)  ¶  t  .  Note  (cid:209)

 2  = ¶  i ¶  i. 

     The  cross-term  energy  of    Eq.  (14a)  is  not  present  at  calibration,  and 

physically is deposited in or “seen” by the detector (fraction), and so it is real and 

measurable.  The same holds true for  y * Hop y

 .  This is the physics (two models  

are forthcoming in another paper).    

     Lastly, to end this  sub-section, we may calculate exactly (mathematically) the 

expression 

 

 

 

 < E >s

    >   D Es

          ,                                                  Eq. (15) 

i.e., we have a formula for each side of this inequality.  A result  “greater than”  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

would  mean  that  the  energy  may  be  “resolved”    experimentally,  with  some 

accuracy.  The sense “less than” would indicate imprecision.   

     Anyhow, part of designing an experiment is  ‘to choose’    f  ( x i, t )  such that  

Eq. (15) is physically satisfied (in principle). 

SECTION  2a.  A  COMMENT  ON  UNCERTAINTY.    Consider    a  four-volume           

(without the term  ( -g )1/2)   for uncertainty 

W = D x D y D z D ct      ,                                               Eq. (16a) 

generally supressing the ‘subscript s

’ .  Furthermore let 

U = D px  D py D pz D E/c     .                                         Eq. (16b). 

 

 

 

Hence 

WU ‡   ( h / 2 ) 4         ,                                                                   Eq. (17) 

by the uncertainty principle, which is essentially the equation 

           [ x m  , p n  ] = i h g m

      .                                                                        Eq. (18) 

     Nature  quantizes  the  vierbein    giving    a  four-momentum  operator  on  the 

manifold, e.g.,  (h / i)  ¶

 4  .  (cf. Sect. 4) 

     Our three-volume, V, must satisfy 

    

 

V  > D x D y D z                                                              Eq. (19) 

for accuracy.  The opposite sense  “less than” would indicate imprecision. 

     Anyway, these quantities , Eqs. (16ab), and Eq. (12) , result in the equation 

(2/ h ) 3 [ W U ] s

     +  (disturbed system)  ‡  h

     .                  Eq. (20) 

     This sub-section is only intended as a brief account of  Eq. (20).

SECTION  3.  POSITION  ENSEMBLE  AVERAGE.    Referring  again  to  Eq.  (10a), 

this time for the position operator, we find that  

 

< x i >s    =  ∫ s *  x i  s

  d3x      ,                                    Eq. (21) 

integrating over all space.   

     The next thing that we do is to put down the equation 

            

< x i >detector   =  ∫ f  *  x i   f   d3x     ,                            Eq. (22) 

integrating over all space. 

     This  equation  is  related  to  the  Bohr  Correspondence  Principle.    Physically, 

when  Eq.  (22)  redoxes 

to 

its  (possibly  macroscopic)  boundaries, 

the 

correspondence  principle  tells  us  that  the  deBroglie  wavelength  of  the  detector 

“Bohr  corresponds” 

to  spatial  dimensions  of 

the  detector,  Di. 

  Bohr 

correspondence is denoted generally by 

 

 

 

quantum law    -  B ﬁ

   classical law   .                     Eq. (23a) 

Our Bohr correspondence then obtains as 

< x i >detector    ~   (h/ pi )detector 

                      -  B ﬁ

   Di       . 

 

                 Eq. (23b) 

     The  Di    are  measurable  at  any  time,  as  the  correspondence  Eq.  (23b)  and 

wave-particle duality  explain.  One plan would be to measure the Di without 

disturbing  the  detector.    The  experimenters  know,  presumably,  what  they  have 

built  and  must  estimate    f     ,  perhaps  with  the  use  of  computers,  as  a 

superposition of  all the detector atoms (if appropriate to the experiment).

SECTION 4.  MOMENTUM ENSEMBLE AVERAGE.  The equation for  < p i >  is 

just mentioned here and reads 

taken from Eq. (10a). 

 

 

< p i >s    =  ∫ s *  (h / i)  ¶

 i s

 d3x       ,                           Eq. (24) 

SECTION  5.  CONCLUSIONS.    Of  the  four  types  of  measurements,  i.e., 

probability,  energy,  position,  and  momentum,    those  of    P

    and    <  E  >s

      have 

been  treated  in  the  most  detail  as    ways  to  access  the  AS  interpretation 

experimentally.

ADDENDUM 

     The  author  would  wish  to  point  out  that the    historical  name  “collapse  of  the 

wavefunction”    in  the  Copenhagen  interpretation  is  used  in  a  context  where 

nothing  actually  physically  collapses.    We  also  do  not  want  to  use  the  other 

standard term “reduction of the wavefunction” . 

     It would be nice to make-up a catchy name  to use in AS for going from Hilbert 

space  to  physical  reality.    We  have  proposed  coining  the  phrase  “redox  of  the 

wavefunction”  - for reduction with a difference (borrowing from Chemistry).

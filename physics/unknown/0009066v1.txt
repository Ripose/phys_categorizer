A previously proposed geometric definition of mass in terms of energy, in a geometrical unified
theory, is used to obtain a numerical expression for a ratio of masses of geometrical excitations.
The resultant geometric ratio is approximately equal the ratio of the proton to electron physical
masses.

1. Introduction.

We have presented a definition of mass [1 ], within our geometric unified theory of gravitation and other interac-
tions, in terms of the concept of self energy of the non linear self interaction in a geometric space, leading to the mass
term in Dirac’s equation. The concept of mass plays a fundamental role in relativity as shown by the relation between
mass and energy and the principle of equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass. It is then of interest to find
a method to carry a numerical calculation to test the proposed geometric model.

On the other hand we also have considered an approximation to the geometric non linear theory [2 ] where the
microscopic  physical  objects  (geometric  particles)  are  realized  as  linear  geometric  excitations,  geometrically  de-
scribed in a jet bundle formalism shown to lead to the standard quantum field theory techniques. These geometric
excitations are essentially perturbations around a non linear geometric background space, where the excitations may
be considered to evolve with time. In this framework, a geometric particle is acted upon by the background and is
never really free except in absolute empty background space (zero background curvature). The background space
carries the universal inertial properties which should be consistent with the ideas of Mach [3 ] and Einstein [4 ] that
assign  fundamental  importance  of  far-away  matter  in  determining  the  inertial  properties  of  local  matter.  We  may
interpret  the  geometric  excitations  as  geometric  particles  and  the  background  as  the  particle  vacuum.  This  is  a
generalization of what is normally done in quantum field theory when particles are interpreted as vacuum excitations.
The vacuum is replaced by a geometric symmetric curved background space.

In quantum electrodynamis the self energy is a source of problems. The infinite energy of the vacuum state is
resolved by subtracting the infinite self energy by using the ordered products of operators. Similarly, the electron mass
is infinite in quantum electrodynamics. This problem is resolved by subtracting the infinite self energy effect and
assuming the experimental value for the mass, in the process of renormalization.

These problems do not arise in our treatment. If we consider geometric excitations on a background, the expres-
sion defining mass may be expanded in a perturbation series around the background with a finite zeroth order term
given entirely by the system self energy in terms of  the background current and connection. The higher order terms
are corrections depending on the excitation self interaction. As indicated in previous work, these corrections corre-
spond to a geometric quantum field theory and may be taken care by the standard quantum field techinques. There is
no ad-hoc assumption on our calculation because it is based, as indicated in the first paragraph, in a definition of mass
given in a unified theory long before this calculation was attempted.

In this article we limit ourselves to the zeroth order background contribution, which we consider a bare mass,
subject to further corrections. The existence of a simple particular solution to the background field equations allows
the possibility of calculating these geometrical bare masses and obtain mass ratios using ratios of volumes of symmet-
ric spaces, obtained from the structure group as cosets with respect to some of its subgroups. It should be noted that
the structure group G of the theory, SL(4,R), has been used to describe particle properties [5 ,6 ,7 ] in another ap-
proach. First we shall review the concept of geometric excitations.

The fundamental dynamic process in the theory is the action of the connection on the frame. Since the connection
is valued in the Lie algebra of G and the frame is an element of the group G, the dynamics is realized by the action of
the group on itself. The principal bundle structure of the group, (G,K,L), provides a natural geometric interpretation
of its action on itself. A particular subgroup L defines a symmetric space K, the coset G/L, the base space of the
bundle. The subgroup L, the fiber of the bundle, is the isotropy subgroup of the coset K acts on itself. The complemen-
tary coset elements act as translations on the symmetric coset.

This geometric interpretation may be transformed into a physical interpretation if we choose L to be homomorphic
to the spinor group, SL(2,C), related to the Lorentz group. The action of L is then interpreted as a pseudo rotation
(Lorentz transformation) of the external space, the tangent space TM of the physical space time manifold M, defining
a metric. The action of the complementary coset K is  interpreted as a translation in an internal space, the symmetric
coset K itself. There is then a non trivial geometric relation between the internal and external spaces determined by
the Clifford algebra structure of the manifold. The space K is the exponentiation of the odd sector of the Clifford
algebra and is related to local copies of the tangent space TM and its dual cotangent space T*M and may be interpreted
as a generalized momentum space. The states of momentum k would correspond to a point of K.

It follows that the frame excitations are also acted by the connection and evolve as representations of G. Different
observers would measure different relative momenta k for a given excitation. A measurement for each k corresponds
to a function in momentum space. An abstract excitation is an equivalence class of these functions, under the relativ-
ity group. Since the group space itself carries its own representations, the realization of excitations as representations
defined on the group space have a fundamental geometric character. The geometric action of the K sector is a trans-

3

lation on itself and the functions on K are the observable internal linear representations. The action of the L sector is
a Lorentz transformation and sl(2,C) spinors are the observable external representations. For these reasons, we must
represent  physically  observable  excitations  by  classes  of  spinor  valued  functions  on  the  symmetric  K  space.  In
particular,  we  realize  them  on  a  vector  bundle,  associated  to  the  principal  bundle  (E,M,G),  with  fiber  the  sl(2,C)
representation valued functions on the symmetric K space. In mathematics, these representations are called represen-
tations  of  SL(4,R)  induced  from  SL(2,C).  Essentially,  this  is,  in  fact,  done  in  particle  physics  when  considering
representations of the Poincare group.

From our geometric point of view, it has been indicated [8 ] that the three stable particles, proton, electron and
neutrino appear to be representations of the only three dynamical subgroups of SL(4,R) induced respectively from the
even subgroups SL1(2,C) and SL(2,C). This is a generalization of particles as representations of the Poincare group
induced from its Lorentz subgroup. Therefore we shall apply the proposed definition of mass to these representations,
thus obtaining a physical and mathematically different calculation. It should be noted that there is no contradiction in
this calculation with present physical theories, which may be considered as effective theories derived under certain
conditions and limits from other theories.

2. Bare Masses.

The definition of the mass parameter m, in terms of a connection ω on the principal fiber bundle (E, M, G), has
been given in the fundamental defining representation of SL(4,R) in terms of 4×4 matrices, but in general, may be
written for other representations using the Cartan-Killing metric gC, defined by the trace. The definition of this metric
may be extended to the Clifford algebra A, which is an enveloping algebra of both sl(4,R) and sp(4,R). The Clifford
algebra  A  is  a  representation  and  a  subalgebra  of  the  universal  enveloping  algebra  U  of  these  Lie  algebras.  The
dimension of the vector space carrying the group representations is the trace of the representation of the identity in A.
We may write the definition of the mass parameter in any representation of the algebras sl(4,R) and sp(4,R) and the
corresponding representation of the common enveloping Clifford algebra ,(A) as

It is known that the Cartan metric depends on the representations, but we shall only apply this expression to find
ratios within a particular fixed induced representation of the enveloping algebra.

If we consider geometric excitations on a background, this mass may be expanded as a perturbation around the

background in terms of the only small parameter α, characterizing the excitation,

indicating that the zeroth order term is given entirely by the background current and connection, with corrections
depending on the excitation self interaction. As indicated in previous work [9 ], these corrections correspond to a
geometric quantum field theory. In this article we limit ourselves to the zeroth order term which we consider the bare
mass of QFT.

The structure group G is SL(4,R) and the even subgroup G+ is SL1(2,C). The subgroup L is the subgroup of G+ with
real determinant in other words, Sl(2,C). There is another subgroup H in the group chain G⊃H⊃L which is Sp(4,R).
The corresponding symmetric spaces and their isomorphisms are discussed in appendix B. We are dealing with two

These groups have a principal bundle structure over the cosets and themselves carry representations. The geometric
action of the K generators are translations on the coset K. The functions on K are the natural internal representations.

4

We shall consider, then, the representations of SL(4,R) and Sp(4,R) induced from the subgroups SL1(2,C) and
SL(2,C)  over  the  symmetric  spaces  SL(4,R)/SL1(2,C)  and  Sp(4,R)/SL(2,C),  respectively.  The  geometric  induced
representations may be realized as sections of a homogeneous vector bundle (D, K, ,[SL1(2,C)], G+) with SL1(2,C)
representations , as fiber F over the coset K [10 ]. To the induced representation of SL(4,R) on D, there corresponds
an induced representation of the enveloping Clifford algebra A on D [11 ]. Furthermore, to the latter also corresponds
a representation of the subgroup Sp(4,R) on D. In other words, the vector bundle D carries corresponding representations
of A, SL(4,R) and Sp(4,R). These three representations are functions on K valued on representations of SL1(2,C). At
each point of the base space M we consider the function space Σ of all sections of the homogeneous vector bundle D.
Define a vector bundle S≡ (S, M, Σ, G), associated to the principal bundle E, with fiber the function space Σ of sections
of D. The fiber of S is formed by induced representations of G.

There is an induced connection acting, as the adjoint representation of G, on the bundle S. The connection ω is
represented by matrix operators (Lorentz rotations on L and translations on K). The induced connection ω may be
decomposed in terms of a set of basis functions characterized by a parameter k, the generalized spherical functions Yk
on  the  symmetric  space  [12 ].  If  K  were  compact,  the  basis  of  this  function  space  would  be  discrete,  of  infinite
dimensions d. The components, relative to this basis would be labeled by an infinite number of discrete indices k.
Expressing the Cartan-Killing metric in the induced representation, we formally would have for the mass parameter,

Since  the  spaces  under  discussion  are  non  compact,  the  discrete  indices  k  that  label  the  components,  become
continuous labels and the summation in matrix multiplication becomes integration over the continuous parameter k.
In addition, we are working with 4 dimensional matrices and continuous functions on the cosets, and the Cartan-
Killing metric in A, expressed by trace and integration, introduces a 4V(KR) dimensionality factor for the common
carrier space D, giving,

where V(AR) is a volume characterizing the dimension of the continuous representation of A. We interpret the value of
a function at k as the component with respect to the basis functions Y(kx) of the symmetric space K, parametrized by
k, as usually done in flat space in terms of a Fourier expansion. We may say that there are as many “translations” as
points in K. It should be noted that these “translations” do not form the well known Abelian translation group.
The G-connection on E induces a SO(3,1)-connection on TM. The combined action of the connections, under the
even subgroup G+, leaves the orthonormal set κµ invariant [13 ], defining a geometric relativistic equivalence relation
R in the odd subspace K. Each element of the coset is a group element k that corresponds to an odd moving frame. A
class of equivalent moving frames k is represented, up to an SL1(2,C) transformation, by a single rest frame, a point
k0.  Decomposition  of Γ  and  J  is  into  equivalence  classes  of  state  functions  Y(kx).  The  dimension  of  the  induced
representation space, or number of classes of state functions Y(kx) (independent bases), is the volume of a subspace
⊂K of classes (non equivalent) of points. The current and connection components are functions over the coset K.

Physically the integral represents summation of the connection × current product, over all inequivalent odd observers,

There is a constant solution [14 ] for the non linear differential equations (see the appendix) that provides a trivial
connection ϖ to the principal fiber bundle (E,M,G). This SL(4,R) valued 1-form on E represents the class of equivalent
local connection forms represented by the constant solution. At some particular frame s, that we may take as origin of
the coset, the local expression for ϖ is the constant
∗ = −

s
All points of K or C may be reached by the action of a translation by k, restricted to the corresponding subgroup,
from the origin of the coset. As the reference frame changes from s at the origin to sk at point k of the coset, the  local
connection form changes

class ϖ, seen in the different frames of the coset.

In the principal bundle the constant connection ϖ, combines with the constant J to produce a product constant
over  the  coset  K,  as  long  as  the  transformation  is  orthogonal  to  J  [15 ].  As  indicated  before,  the  mass  variation,
produced by the last term in the equation due to an arbitrary choice of frame, corresponds to inertial effects. The non
inertial effects are due to the first term in the right hand side of the equation which corresponds to the symbol Λ. It is
clear that its subtraction from the connection transforms as a connection, because the current J is a tensorial form, and
corresponds to the inertial connection. The latter connection is expressed by the last term in the equation and only has
a k dependence. The physical contribution to the bare mass parameter may be calculated in the special frame s giving,

The bare mass parameters m are related to integration on certain subspaces of the coset spaces, depending proportionally
on the volumes of the respective coset spaces. In other words, the ratio of the bare mass parameters for representations
of SL(4,R) and Sp(4,R), induced from the same SL(2,C) representation as functions on cosets K and C⊂K would be
equal to the ratio of the volumes of the respective subspaces.

It is known that the Hermitian symmetric spaces are classified by certain group quotients. The symmetric space K
is  a  non  compact  real  form  of  the  complex  symmetric  space  corresponding  to  the  complex  extension  of  the  non
compact group SU(2,2) and its quotients as shown in appendix B. This space coincides with the quotient SO(3,3)/
SO(3,1)SO(2) of the SO(4,2) series. In particular we have the 8 dimensional spaces

which are the five real forms characterized by SO(4,2). The extreme spaces correspond to the two Hermitian spaces,
compact and non compact R.

Between the extremes we find the three non Hermitian non compact spaces, in particular the space of interest K.

In the regular representation these quotients have the matricial structure,

metric, related to the Euclidian metric by Weyl’s unitary trick. As in the previous case, this condition determines a
unit symmetric space.

Since these conditions are difficult to analyze, it is convenient to find the volume using the complex structure of
µ

 on K. In this way we obtain a symmetric bilinear complex

There  are  two  standard  projections  of  the  complex  numbers  C  on  the  real  numbers  R,  the  real  part  and  the
modulus. In a similar manner as the modulus projects the complex plane to the real half line , we define an equivalence
relation S in the points on K by defining equivalent points as points with equal moduli coordinates. This equivalence
relation may be expressed by
S
where S1 is the one dimensional phase sphere. We may define the 4 dimensional quotient Q by

It  is  then  convenient  to  parametrize  K  in  accordance  with  this  equivalence  relation  S.  Each  of  the  4  complex
coordinates z has a modulus zand a phase ψ  which will be used as parameters. The Haar measure in terms of the
Euclidian measure should correspond to integration on a complex 4 dimensional space. We choose the parameters

The  Jacobian  does  not  depend  on  the  phases  and  the  volume  element  of  S  is  separable  from  dµ  defining  a
complementary volume element corresponding to the quotient Q. The volume of K will then be the product of the
volumes of S and Q, as indicated also by eq. ( 3.2.27). It may be seen that Q is a symmetric space, by taking as its
representative points those with real coordinates. On the other hand Q must be non compact, otherwise K would also
be compact since the relation S is compact. The quotient cannot be a product of a manifold times a discrete set because
then K would have disconnected components. The SO(4,R) subgroup of SO(4,C), which acts on this subspace Q of K
preserving the bilinear metric in this space, has S3 as orbit. Therefore Q is symmetric, four dimensional, non compact
with a three dimensional compact subspace Σ

S equal to the Riemannian sphere S3,

3.3 Ratio of Geometric Volumes

We expect that the ratio of the volumes V  of the inequivalent subspaces corresponding to fundamental representations
of spin 1/2 should be related to the ratio of the corresponding physical bare masses. As indicated in section 2, there is
a subset of points of the symmetric spaces that are relativistic equivalent. We have to eliminate these equivalent points
by dividing by the equivalence relation R under the boosts of SO(3,1). Equivalent points are related by a Lorentz boost
transformation of magnitude β . There are as many equivalent points as the volume of the orbit developed by the
parameter  β.

The respective inequivalent volumes are, for C,

Although the volumes of the non compact spaces diverge, their ratio taking in consideration the equivalence relation

We  actually  have  shown  in  this  section  a  theorem  that  says:  The  ratio  of  the  volumes  of  K  and  C,  up  to  the

equivalence relation R under the relativity isotropy subgroup, is finite and has the value 6π5 .

4. Physical Mass Ratios.

It is clear from the discussion in section 1 that, for a constant solution, the masses are proportional to the respective
volumes V(KR). The constants of proportionality only depend on the specified inducing SL(2,C) representations. In
particular for any two representation induced from the the spin 1/2 representation of L, the respective constants are
equal.

Armed with the theorem of the previous section, the ratio of masses of G-excitations and H-excitations given by
the fundamental representations of the groups G and its subgroup H induced from the spin 1/2 representation of L, for
the constant solution, equals the ratio of the volumes of the inequivalent subspaces of the respective cosets G/L1 and
H/L. The ratio of bare masses for these geometric excitations has the finite exact value,

which is a very good approximation for the ratio of the experimental physical values for the proton mass and the
electron mass. This geometrical expression was previously known but not physically explained [19 ,20 ,21 ].

If we reject the easy explanation that this result is a pure coincidence, we should try to relate the G group to the
proton and the H group to the electron. If this were the case the only other dynamical subgroup L=SL(2,C) of G should
lead to a similar mass ratio. Previously we have related L to the neutrino. In this case the quotient space is the identity
and we get,

5. Conclusion.

The ratio of geometrical masses  mL/mH, given by the volumes of the quotients SL(4,R)/SL1(2,C) and Sp(4,R)/
SL(2,C)) up to the equivalence relation under SL(2,C) is equal, with a discrepancy of 2×10-5, to the value of the ratio
of the masses of the proton and the electron.

It appears that the values of the bare masses of the proton and electron may be calculated as masses of geometric
excitations  in  this  unified  theory.  These  values  necessarily  need  correction  terms  to  obtain  the  physical  masses,
because of the interactions of the excitations. These corrections, due to the self interaction of the excitations may be
expected to be of the order of α2, equal to the order of the discrepancy.

6. Appendix A.

The non linear equations of the theory are applicable to an isolated background physical system interacting with
itself. Of course the equations must be expressed in terms of components with respect to an arbitrary reference frame.
A reference frame adapted to an arbitrary observer introduces arbitrary fields which do not contain any information
related to the physical system in question.

Any excitation must be associated to a definite background. An arbitrary observation of an excitation property
depends on both the excitation and the background, but the physical observer must be the same for both excitation and
background.  We  may  use  the  freedom  to  select  the  reference  frame,  to  refer  the  excitation  to  the  physical  frame
defined by its own background.

We have chosen the current density 3-form J corresponding to the vector,
µκ= ~ 

in terms of the matter spinor frame e and the orthonormal space-time tetrad u .

Since we selected that the background be referred to itself, the background matter frame eb, referred to er becomes
the group identity I. Actually this generalizes comoving coordinates (coordinates adapted to dust matter geodesics)
[22 ]. We adopt coordinates adapted to local background matter frames (the only non arbitrary frame is itself, as are
the  comoving  coordinates  defined  by  an  isolated  fluid).  If  the  frame  e  becomes  the  identity  I  (in  the  group),  the
background current density becomes a constant, invariant under the action of the connections,
J
Comparison of an object with itself gives trivial information. For example free matter or an observer are always at rest
with themselves, no velocity, no acceleration, no self forces, etc. In its own reference frame these effects actually
disappear. Only constant self energy terms, determined by the non linearity, makes sense and should be the origin of
the constant mass.

The trivial connection is essentially proportional to the current, up to an automorphism. It should be noted that in
the expression for ω, the term containing the current J is the potential tensorial form Λ, used in chapter 8 in the
definition of mass. Its subtraction from ω gives an object, e-1de, that transforms as a connection.

7. Appendix B.

The series of quotient spaces related to the A3 Cartan space are of interest. In particular we choose the involutive
automorphism of type AIII(p=2,q=2) that determines a seven dimensional compact subgroup G+. We obtain, in this
manner, a series of eight dimensional spaces, characterized by the non compact group SU(2,2), corresponding to the
Riemannian space G/G+ and its dual G*/G+,

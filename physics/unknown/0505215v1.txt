Abstract.  A  new  method  for  characterization  of  periodically  poled  crystals  is  developed  based  on 

spontaneous  parametric  down-conversion.  The  method  is  demonstrated  on  crystals  of  Y:LiNbO3, 

Mg:Y:LiNbO3 with non-uniform periodically poled structures, obtained directly under Czochralski growth 

procedure  and  designed  for  application  of  1.064  µm-pumped  OPO  in  the  mid  infrared  range.  Infrared 

dispersion  of  refractive  index,  effective  working  periods  and  wavelengths  of  OPO  were  determined  by 

special  treatment  of  frequency-angular  spectra  of  spontaneous  parametric  down-conversion  in  the  visible 

range.  Two-dimensional  mapping  via  spontaneous  parametric  down-conversion  is  proposed  for 

characterizing  spatial  distribution  of  bulk  quasi-phase  matching  efficiency  across  the  input  window  of  a 

periodically poled sample.

1. Introduction 

During  the  last  two  decades,  the  use  of  periodically  poled  (PP)  crystals  has  greatly  extended  the  area  of 

new  nonlinear  optical  ideas  and  devices  [1,2].  At  the  same  time,  various  methods  for  fabricating  PP 

elements  are  widely  developed  [3]  and  the  problem  of  characterization  for  such  PP  structures  becomes 

essential. Usually, the PP structures have the desired periods and directions with respect to crystal axes, but 

the  degree  of  their  periodicity  is  limited,  and  domain  walls  can  be  non-planar;  other  defects  occur 

depending  on  the  poling  technique.    Evidently,  these  effects  decrease  non-linear  efficiencies  of  PP 

elements, and the methods for estimating final efficiencies are crucial.

The most prevalent method of characterizing PP structures is imaging of chemically etched crystal 

surfaces  [4],  based  on  unequal  etching  rates  for  domains  of  anti-parallel  polarization.  As  other  surface-

based methods, such as electro-optic imaging microscopy [5], scanning electron microscopy [6], near-field 

scanning  optical  microscopy  [7],  scanning  atomic  force  microscopy  [4],  x-ray  diffraction  imaging  [8], 

optical  microscopy  of  etched  samples  enable  us  to  measure  directly  sizes  of  domains  along  a  selected 

plane. Nevertheless, only a limited area of the structure is studied, the inner parts are inaccessible without 

destruction of the sample. One needs to make a statistical treatment of the data on domain widths, obtained 

from  the  whole  surface  of  the  structure,  to  make  conclusion  about  its  quality  for  a  nonlinear  optical 

application. On the other hand, the methods based on non-linear optical effects such as imaging via second-

harmonic generation [9-11], domain mapping via terahertz wave form analysis [12], and the method based 

on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) [13-15] are free of these disadvantages. Usually, an 

appropriate non-linear effect is taken as an initial probing process to test inner parts of a PP structure and to 

predict its general characteristics in other non-linear applications. Among these methods, SPDC provides 

information for the widest spectral range, and can be organized in different quasi-phase matching regimes 

for  the  largest  variety  of  PP  crystals.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  a  large  reservoir  of  zero  vacuum 

fluctuations  acts  during  SPDC  process  as  probe  idler  waves  of  all  possible  directions  and  in  the  whole 

spectral range below a pump frequency [16].  

In  this  paper,  we  further  develop  the  SPDC-based  characterization  technique,  for  the  first  time 

propose  the  SPDC-based  mapping  of  PP  samples,  and  demonstrate  the  ability  of  this  method  by  the 

example  of  PP  crystals  of  doped  lithium  niobate  (PPLN),  Y:LiNbO3  and  Mg:Y:LiNbO3,  designed  for 

applications  in  OPO  schemes  for  generation  of  mid  infrared  (MIR)  radiation  near  4  mm.  The  crystals 

contained 1-dimensional domain grating produced directly under Czochralski growth procedure [17]. This 

enabled  PPLN  samples  of  larger  transverse  sizes,  with  domain  walls  of  higher  threshold  upon  possible 

thermal and radiation influence [18-19] in comparison with PPLN crystal chips obtained under post-growth 

techniques [1,4,21,22].  Nevertheless, degree of periodicity is not so high everywhere and can be different 

in  different  parts  of  the  grown  bole.  The  initial  characterization  and  selection  of  the  best  part  is  much 

desired  so  as  to  derive  maximum  efficiency  in  further  applications.  Apart  from  the  applications,  where 

some special types of aperiodicity are necessary (for example, Fibonacci- or Cantor-type nonlinear gratings 

[23-25], stochastic disordered structures [2,25-27]), a higher regularity is required.  Thus, it is appropriate 

to select  the  regular parts  by  analyzing  the visible nonlinear  signal,  and  then  to  recommend  this  part  for 

applications in other spectral ranges. For example, tuning curves for quasi-synchronous eee-type MIR OPO 

are  known  to  be  very  sensitive  to  dispersion  of  refractive  index  and  to  period  of  nonlinear  grating  [28]. 

This fact further strengthens the need for greater accuracy in characterization. 

The paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 contains requirements for the samples from the viewpoint 

of MIR-range generation, details of the samples fabrication procedure, and results of their primary study by 

chemical etching. Further these results are compared with the data of SPDC–based characterization, which 

consist of  three steps. Obtained as the first step of characterization, overview SPDC spectra are presented 

in  Sec.  3.  In  Sec.  4,  we  discuss  how  such  spectra  are  formed  in  crystals  with  periodic  and  non-periodic 

spatial distribution of second-order optical susceptibility and present results of their treatment at the second 

characterization step. SPDC-based mapping, made finally at the third step, is considered in Sec. 5. Results 

are summarized in Sec. 6. 

 

2. Samples 

The samples were cut from 2 boules of bulk PPLN, with chemical formula Y:LiNbO3 and Mg:Y:LiNbO3.  

The  boules  were  grown  using  Czochralski  technique  along  X-axis  from  close  to  congruently  melting 

composition Li/Nb = 0.942 with 1 wt % Y2O3 and, in case of Mg:Y:LiNbO3, with 2 mol% MgO. Doping 

by Y was used to form PP domain structure on the basis of rotation-induced growth striations in the bulk of 

LiNbO3  single  crystals.  Codoping  by  Mg,  not  only  reduces  photorefractive  damage,  provides  additional 

fixing of domain walls at the growth striations.  As it is established for this domain fabrication technique, 

period of a nonlinear grating is determined by the ratio between pulling and rotation rates under the growth 

procedure  [17,29].  In  our  case  pulling  and  rotation  rates  were  10  mm/h  and  6  rpm,  correspondingly,  the 

expected value of PP structure period was 28 µm. The samples of 17-18 mm long were cut normally to the 

crystal X-axis from central parts of the boules. Parallel to domain walls, the input and output surfaces of 

the samples were polished. These surfaces were of 6-10 mm along Z-axis, and of 2-3 mm along Y-axis.  

 

The  primary  view  of  the  ferroelectric  domain  structure  was  studied  in  all  samples  by  selective 

chemical etching. The crystal surfaces normal to Z-axis were polished and subsequently etched in 1:2 v/v 

mixture of HF and HNO3 acid in Pt-crucible for 2-3 min at boiling temperature. We observed the profile of 

the  etched  surfaces  and  made  optical  images  of  them  using  a  digital  camera  and  an  optical  microscope 

Nikon  MM-40.  Examples  of  optical  micrographs  are  shown  in  Fig.1a,b.  Analysis  of  surface  images  for 

Mg:Y:LiNbO3 crystal shows that the structure is rather regular in the middle parts of the sample surface, 

but some irregularities can be noticed in parts located near peripheral areas of the bole. As it was expected, 

the degree of periodicity in Y:LiNbO3 crystal samples was not uniform in all parts of their surfaces (Fig. 

1b).  Usually, the etching technique enables one to measure periods of the PP structure at Z surfaces, but 

may  be  inconsistent  in  estimating  the  thicknesses  of  positive  and  negative  domains  because  of  too  deep 

etching, which masks a real ratio of the thicknesses. Relative thicknesses of positive and negative domains 

in  our  samples  were  studied  by  electric  force  microscopy(Fig.1c).  The  distribution  of  electric  field  at  Z-

surfaces  indicated  that  adjacent  domain  layers  were  of  the  same  width  and  a  duty  cycle  of  50%  was 

characteristic for the structures on average.  

The  typical  periods  of  nonlinear  gratings  were  found  to  be  within  32-33  mm  for  Y:Mg:LiNbO3 

crystal samples and within 30-34 mm for Y:LiNbO3 samples. The increasing of the period size as compared 

with  calculated  period  (28  mm)  was  connected  with  decreasing  of  the  melt  level  in  the  crystal  growth 

process.  Nevertheless,  the  values  beyond  these  intervals  were  also  observed.  It  became  obvious  that 

laborious statistical treatments of images via the whole sample lengths would be necessary for formulating 

any  reliable  conclusions  about  the  most  effective  average  period  for  each  sample.  At  the  same  time, 

necessary  requirements for  parameters of nonlinear gratings  are usually quite  strict.  Using  available data 

[30-34]  on  refractive  index  dispersion  for  pure  congruent  and  Mg-doped  crystals,  we  determined 

wavelengths  of  MIR  idler  radiation  near  4  mm  under  eee-type  parametric  down-coversion  of  pump 

radiation at 1.064 mm in PPLN and Mg:PPLN crystals  with nonlinear gratings of different periods (Fig.2). 

It was shown that   

1)  when period of a non-linear grating changes very slightly - on 0.1 µm, the wavelength of idler radiation 

in MIR is shifted appreciably - to about 0.035 mm; 

2)  temperature tuning in the range 20-200 0C changes the idler wavelength up to about 0.055 mm (increase 

of the temperature leads to decrease of the MIR wavelength); 

3)  decrease of Mg-content leads to decrease of an idler wavelength, which can be compensated by proper 

decrease of a grating period.  

In  order  to  clarify  how  much  the  samples  satisfy  the  conditions  necessary  for  non-linear  optical 

applications, the SPDC-based characterization was utilized. 

 

3. Observation of frequency-angular SPDC spectra  

Fig.3  illustrates  the  principal  scheme  of  SPDC-spectrograph  -  the  experimental  set-up  for 

registration of two-dimensional frequency-angular spectra of SPDC in nonlinear crystals [35]. The linearly 

polarized  pump  beam  of  laser  source  is  incident  on  a  crystal.  The  scattered  radiation  passes  through  an 

optical registration system, which includes an analyzer, lenses, and a spectrograph, to be finally recorded 

by  a  scanning  detector  or  by  a  photographic  film  mounted  at  the  spectrograph  output  window.  SPDC 

process  in  any  medium  with  second-order  susceptibility  can  be  treated  as  a  spontaneous  decay  of  pump 

photons  of  frequency  wp  into  signal  and  idler  photons  of  frequencies  ws  and  wi:  wp=ws+ wi  [16].  In 

spectroscopic  schemes,  wp  and  ws  are  in  a  spectral  region  of  crystal  transparency,  usually,  in  a  visible 

range; idler frequencies wi <ws and can occupy the IR transparency region, as well as the range of phonon 

absorption.  When  wi  hits  the  spectral  range  of  optical  phonons,  SPDC  is  transformed  into  near-forward 

Raman  scattering  by  polaritons,  which  is  also  observable  via  SPDC-spectrograph  [35-38].  In  SPDC-

spectrograph  the  signal  radiation  is  sorted  according  to  its  frequency  and  according  to  its  angle  of 

direction. Usually, a frequency sweep is made along the axis, which is oriented normally to a spectrograph 

entrance slit. An additional angle sweep is made along the transverse axis, which is parallel to the slit. The 

angle sweep is arranged by a lens system, which focuses the signal radiation on the slit. Displacement of 

the  focus position  from  the  center of  the  slit is proportional  to  tgθs,  where qs  is  the  angle of  the  signal 

direction with respect to the optical axis of the system (Fig.3). 

 Fig.4 and Fig.5a show the examples of SPDC overview spectra obtained for our samples in ooe-

geometry: pump was directed along crystallographic X-axis and extraordinarily polarized along Z-axis, the 

idler and signal waves were directed in XZ plane and ordinarily polarized along Y-axis. Ar-laser radiation 

at a wavelength of 488 nm was used as a pump beam. The horizontal spectral sweep is given in terms of 

signal  wavelengths  and  represents  the  parts  of  the  whole  spectra  which  correspond  to  SPDC  in 

transparency region (in other words, to near-forward Raman scattering at the upper polariton branch). Here 
the  idler  frequencies  are  more  than  the  largest  longitudinal  phonon  frequency:  ni= wi/2pc  >  880  cm-1. 

Formally,  the  region of  crystal  transparency begins  from  this  side,  phonon-induced absorption  decreases 

when  the  idler  frequency  is  further  increased.  In  this  region  the  SPDC  spectra  consist  of  curves,  which 

display actually the quasi-synchronous tuning curves valid for any types of parametric three-wave mixing 

processes (parametric generation, amplification, frequency conversion, etc.) in the corresponding crystal, 

type of polarization, and frequency conditions. 

 

4. Characterization of crystals via SPDC spectra 

As  it  was  shown  theoretically  [39],  distribution  of  signal  intensity  across  SPDC  spectrum 

P ω θ  is described by general relation, which presents the signal intensity as a function of the wave

wavevectors. For the first approximation, we used Sellmeier formulas, obtained in [31] for pure congruent 

LiNbO3  while  calculating  the  spectra  of  Y:LiNbO3.  For    Mg:Y:LiNbO3  we  used  our  previous  data  on 

refractive index dispersion in Mg:Nd:LiNbO3 [33]. Mg-doping concentrations were the same in both cases, 

but  rare-earth  elements  were  different.  Since  they  enter  crystals  at  very  low  concentrations,  it  seems 

justified to expect their influence on refractive indexes to be small. Following these assumptions, we have 

determined,  which  closed  tuning  curve  is  the  result  of  synchronous  interaction,  characterized  by  m=0 

(

 Different  curves  in  each  group  at  SPDC  spectrum  correspond  to  the  same  order  of  quasi-

is representative of an irregular distribution of domain thickness, when the structure period in (1) is taken 

equal  to  the  length  of  the  whole  crystal  L.  Special  treatment  shows  [14,15]  that  one  can  measure  the

. By making an inverse Fourier treatment (2), one can determine the whole 

distribution 

(2) ( )xχ

  in  a  sample  along  the  pump  beam  [14].  Nevertheless,  this  inverse  treatment 

procedure is not quite necessary when the sample is characterized for further applications. Indeed, in other 

three-wave  interactions,  in  the  initial  low-amplification  stage,  the  intensity  dependence  on  the  phase 

mismatch will be of the same character, assigned by exp. (1). Only the magnitude (4) of the mismatches as 

functions of frequencies and/or angles will be modified in accordance with new dispersion characteristics 

of  the  crystal  in  another  frequency  range.  We  can  thus  regard  a  crystal  sample  as  a  number  of  built-in 

nonlinear gratings, characterized by different working periods with their individual non-linear efficiencies. 

The characteristic efficiency is described by a square of corresponding

corresponding working periods. As  for  example,  the  corresponding values of  MIR  idler  wavelengths  for 

1.064 µm-pumped OPO are indicated at additional horizontal axis in Fig.5b. 

 

5. SPDC mapping 

  

Each SPDC spectrum can be used to characterize that part of a sample volume, which has been a 

source of a signal measured under SPDC, and is regarded as a source in other applications. In case of our 

SPDC  spectra,  it  had  transverse  sizes  of  a  pump  beam  and  was  as  long  as  a  whole  sample.    A  set  of 

overview  spectra,  obtained  for  different  parts  of  each  crystal  sample,  showed,  that  distribution  of 

efficiencies among various working periods is different. To characterize the whole volume of the samples, 

we organized the special SPDC-based mapping procedure. 

The polarized Ar-laser pumping beam of 1 W was focused on a sample with a spot size of about 50 

µm  along  the  whole  sample  length.  The  sample  was  mounted  on  YZ-motorized  stage  for  subsequent 

scanning  of  the  pumping  spot  across  the  sample.  The  forward  SPDC  signal  at  qs=0  was  selected  using 

diaphragms, analyzer, and filter, and detected by a Jobin Yvon T64000 spectrometer for each position of 

the  spot  with  a  dwelling  time  of  60s.  The  numerous  curves  such  as  examples  in  Fig.5b  were  measured. 

After subtracting the noise background, the intensity of the peak at 603nm was measured as a function of 

crystal position. This peak corresponds to the

(2)

mχ  Fourier harmonic, which determines intensity of idler 

wave  at  4.25  µm  in  OPO  application  under  pumping  at  1.064  µm.  The  scanning  was  made  along 

crystallographic Y and Z axes with steps of 0.1 mm. Finally, it enabled us to build the map of efficiency 

distribution  across  the  sample  surface.  The  map  for  the  mostly  non-uniform  sample  of  Y:LiNbO3  is 

presented in Fig.6. The brighter areas on the map correspond to more effective parts of the sample input 

window.  SPDC  map  characterizes  distribution  of  the  sample  efficiency  across  the  input  and  output 

surfaces, accounting the integral effect of the overall sample length and help to choose the best place for 

further applications.  

  

6. Summary 

We proposed the optical method for mapping the quality of periodically polled crystals for application in 

quasi-phase matching regime. It is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion and enables one to 

characterize  the  overall  non-linear  optical  efficiency  of  inner  parts  of  crystal  samples.  The  method  was 

probed on periodically poled crystals of Y:Mg:LiNbO3 and Y: LiNbO3 grown by Czochralski technique. It 

was  shown  how  the  working  periods  can  be  measured  for  non-regular  nonlinear  superlattices,  and  how 

relative distribution of their non-linear efficiencies can be determined. Although all the measurements are 

made in the visible range, results are suitable for applications in other spectral regions, which can be more 

difficult for direct access. As an illustration, the testing was made for a possible utilization of the samples 

in  the  MIR  range.  A  two-dimensional  map  was  recorded  for  the  spatial  distribution  of  efficiency  of  a 

selected  working  period  across  the  input  window  of  a  sample,  characterizing  the  integral  effect  of  its 

overall length at any points of the input window.

Fig.1.  Images  of  the  etched  Z-  surfaces  of  Mg:Y:LiNbO3  (a,c)  and  Y:LiNbO3  (b)  crystals,  obtained  via 

optical (a,b) and electric force (c) microscopes.  

Fig.2. Mid infrared wavelength of 1.064 mm-pumped eee-type OPO based on congruent pure PPLN (solid 

line)  or  2  mol  %  Mg-doped  PPLN  (dashed  line)  at  room  temperature,  as  a  function  of  domain  grating 

Fig.3. Scheme of SPDC-spectrograph for registration of two-dimensional frequency-angular distribution of 

signal radiation under spontaneous parametric down-conversion. 

Fig.4. Photographic spectrum of SPDC in a periodically poled Mg:Y:LiNbO3 crystal. Vertical axes: angles 

between signal and pump waves (outside a crystal), horizontal axes: wavelength of signal waves.  

Fig.5. a: Photographic spectrum of SPDC in a periodically poled Y:LiNbO3 crystal. b: Spectral distribution 

of  SPDC  signal  intensity  in  the  spectrum  area,  marked by a  dashed  line  for  two different  regions of  the 

crystal.  Phase  mismatches  under  SPDC,  working  periods  of  the  irregular  non-linear  grating,  and  OPO 

wavelengths  in  MIR  range,  all  corresponding  to  SPDC  signal  wavelengths,  are  given  at  additional 

horizontal axes.  

Fig.6. Map of spatial distribution of collinear quasi-phase matched SPDC signal (at a wavelength 603nm) 

across the input window of Y:LiNbO3 periodically poled crystal.

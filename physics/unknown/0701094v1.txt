Abstract

In  recent  years,  industry  has  produced  high-temperature  fiber  and  whiskers.  The  author  examined 
the  atmospheric  reentry  of  the  USA’s  Space  Shuttles  and  proposed  the  use  of  high  temperature 
tolerant  parachute  for  atmospheric  air  braking.  Though  it  is  not  large,  a  light  parachute  decreases 
Shuttle speed from 8 km/s to 1 km/s and Shuttle  heat flow by 3-4 times. The parachute surface is 
opened  with  backside  so  that  it  can  emit  the  heat  radiation  efficiently  to  Earth-atmosphere.  The 
temperature of parachute is about 1000-1300o C. The carbon fiber is able to keep its functionality up 
to  a  temperature  of  1500-2000o  C.  There is  no  conceivable  problem  to  manufacture  the  parachute 
from carbon fiber. The proposed new method of braking may be applied to the old Space Shuttles as 
well as to newer spacecraft designs.

Key words: Atmospheric reentry, Space Shuttle, thermal protection of space apparatus, parachute braking.

Introduction
In  1969  Alexander  A.  Bolonkin  applied  a  new  method  of  global  optimization  to  the  problem  of 
atmospheric reentry of spaceships [1 p. 188]. The general analysis presented an additional method to 
the well-known method of outer space to Earth-atmosphere reentry ("high-speed corridor"). There is 
a low-speed corridor when the total heat is less than in a conventional high-speed passage.  In that 
time for significantly decreasing the speed of a spaceship retro- and landing rocket engine needed to 
be  used.  That  requires  a  lot  of  fuel.    It  is  not  acceptable  for  modern  spaceships.    Nowadays  the 
textile industry produces heat resistant fiber that can be used for a new parachute system to be used 
in a high-temperature environment.

low speed the parachute area can be decreased or parachute can be detached. That case not 
computed. Used control is not optimal.

Discussion of results

  
Fig.5 shows the parachute significantly decreases the shuttle speed from 8000 m/s to 350 - 2900 m/s 
after 550 sec of reentry flight. Practically, the Space Shuttle overpasses the heat barrier (maximum 
of  heat  flow)  near  200  sec  into  its  reentry (see  Fig.  8).  The  heat  flow  depends  on  the  power 3.15 

6

from  speed  (see  the  second  equation  in  (2))  and  the  speed  strongly  influences  the  heat  flow.  For 
example, the decreasing of speed in two times decreases the heat flows in 8.9 times!

Fig. 6 shows: at altitude 41 - 44 km the ship has speed 350 - 2900 m/s which is acceptable for high 

speed vehicle in short time of reentry.
  Fig. 7 shows the maximum temperature in a stagnation point of the parachute. It is 1000 - 1300o C. 
The parachute can be made from carbon fiber that can keep the temperature 1500 - 2000o C (carbon 
melting temperature is over 3000o C). At present a carbon fiber composite matters uses by Shuttle 
for leader edges of Shuttle where temperature reaches 1550o C. 
  Fig.  8  gives  the  heat  flow  through  1  m2/s of  Shuttle  without  or with  a  parachute.  If  we  continue 
flight  time  up  750  sec,  the  special  total  heat  will  be  following:  without  parachute  it  is  11.84108
J/m2, for parachute having area 1000 m2 - 7108 J/m2, for 2000 m2 parachute  - 5108 J/m2, for 4000 
m2 parachute  - 3.5108 J/m2. That is about 1.7 - 3.4 times less then without parachute. It means the 
future  Space  Shuttles  can  have  a  different  system  of  heat  protection  and  a  modern  design  can  be 
made lighter and cheaper. 

Estimation Parachute System

 The weight of the parachute system and a comparison with current heat protection is key moment 
for  this  innovative  method.  Industry  has  produced  many  metal  and  mineral  fibers  and  whiskers 
having very high tensile stress at high temperatures. Let us to estimate the mass of parachute system. 
Assume the carbon fiber having the maximum tensile stress  = 565 kg/mm2 ( = 5.65109 N/m2) at 
temperature T =  1500 - 2000o C is used for parachute.  Let us  take the  safety  margin 2.3  - 3. That
means  = 150 kg/mm2 for canopy and  = 200 kg/mm2 for cord. The fiber density is taken  = 3000 
kg/m3. 
The computation is presented in Table #1.

Currently,  the  mass  of  the  heat  protection  in  Shuttle  is  9575  kg.  If  we  decrease  this  protection 
proportional the decreasing of the heat flow (in 2 - 3 times) we save the 4 - 6 tons of Shuttle mass.
At  the  present  time,  the  changing  of  hundreds  of  hull  protection  tiles  after  every  flight  takes  two 
weeks  and  very  costly  to  do.  The  new  method  requires  only  a  few  tile  replacements  (maximum 
temperature is less) or allows using a protective cooling method.
  The  Command  Module  of  spacecraft "Apollo"  had  a  heat  protection  of  approximately  1/3  of  the 
total  take-off/touchdown  weight.  The  gain  to  be  had  from  a  new  method  reentering  may  be 
significantly more.   

Conclusion

The  widespread  production  of  high  temperature  fibers  and  whiskers  allows  us  to  design  high-
temperature tolerant parachutes, which may be used by space apparatus of all types for braking in a 
rarified  planet  atmosphere.  The  parachute  has  open  backside  surface  that  rapidly  emits  the  heat 
radiation  to  outer  space  thereby  quickly  decreasing  the  parachute  temperature.  The  proposed  new 
method  significantly  decreases  the  maximum  temperature  and  heat  flow  to  main  space  apparatus. 
That decreases the heat protection mass and increases the useful load of the spacecraft. The method 
may be also used during an emergency reentering when spaceship heat protection is damaged (as in 
horrific instance of the Space Shuttle "Columbia").

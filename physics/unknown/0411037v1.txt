The influence of nitrogen impurities on the parameters of the self-sustained normal dc glow discharge 
at atmospheric pressure was studied. The concentrations of the low-excited helium atoms in states 21s, 21p, 
23s and 23p were determined in the atmospheric pressure glow discharge in helium (99.98%He) and in helium 
with  a  nitrogen  admixture.  It  was  shown  that  the  adding  of  nitrogen  into  helium  (less  5%)  leads  to  the 
increase of both interelectrode gap voltage and gas temperature. At the same time the drastically reduction of 
concentration  of  the  low-excited  helium  atoms  in  cathode  region  even  at  nitrogen  admixture  of  0.5  %  is 
occurred. 
 

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

 

There is large increasing interest in atmospheric pressure glow discharges (APGD) because 

they  can  be  used  for  a  wide  range  of  technological  applications  without  the  need  of  vacuum 

systems.  As  a  rule,  helium  in  mixture  with  other  gases  is  used  as  working  gas  in  discharges  at 

atmospheric pressure [1, 2]. However, at present there isn’t a complete understanding of the gas 

discharge physics in gas mixtures at atmospheric pressure. As it was shown in [2], for example, a 

small addition of other gases (~1%) into working gas of barrier discharge plays a significant role in 

stability of this discharge. On the base of numerical calculation it is approved in [3] that even the 
residual  gas  admixtures  with  concentration  ~0.5·10-4  %  exert  a  significant  influence  on  both  the 

plasma composition and the gas discharge parameters in atmospheric pressure discharge.  

The self-sustained normal dc APGD in helium [4] is a convenient object for investigations of 

the kinetics of the weakly ionized nonequilibrium plasma with complicated composition. The low-

excited  levels  of  helium  are  participated  at  many  plasma  chemical  reactions.  Therefore  their 

concentrations  are  one  of  major  parameters  of  nonequilibrium  plasma  of  the  APGD.  In  present 
work  the  concentrations  of  the  low-excited  helium  atoms  in  states  21S,  21P,  23S  and  23P  in  the 

APGD  in  helium  (99.98%He)  and  in  helium  with  a  nitrogen  admixture  (He  99.5%  +  N2  0.5%) 

were determined. 

 

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

The  self-sustained  normal  dc  APGD  was  created  in  the  pressurized  chamber  between  two 

electrodes: the weakly rounded tungsten anode  (diameter 6 mm) and flat circular cooper cathode 

(diameter 30 mm). The intensive water cooling of cathode was ensured due to its special design. 

 

2

The  interelectrode  gap  was  about  4  mm. A weak flow of helium through the discharge chamber 

(less 1 litre/min) was provided. The impurity concentrations in helium flow (H2, N2, O2, Ar, CO2, 

CO, Ne, H2O) did not exceed 0.02 %. The mixtures of helium with nitrogen were prepared in gas-

cylinder in advance.  

As  it  is  seen  in  Fig. 

1a,  the  structure  of  the 

glow  discharge 

is  as 

follows:  a  thin  (less  than 

1-mm  thick)  disc  of  glow 

emission resides above the 

 

cathode  surface,  whereas 

the  glowing  column 

is

and (b) tilted with respect to the cathode surface. 
 

adjacent to anode. There is the Faraday dark space between these glow regions. The anode surface 

is covered with a glowing layer. The positive column contracts to a diameter of about 3–5 mm.  

The voltage- current characteristic of the APGD (Fig. 2) in case of a water-cooled cathode is 

slowly rising in the current and voltage ranges 0.05–15 A and 180–250 V respectively [5]. More 

quick  growth  of  the  interelectrode  voltage, 

when  discharge  current  is  increasing  from  1  A 

to  15  A,  is  the  result  of  the  insufficiency  of 

cathode  cooling.  As  was  shown  in  [6],  the 

potential  profile  along  the  discharge  gap  has  a 

shape  typical  for  classical  glow  discharges  [7]: 

the  major  voltage  drop  (150–200  V)  occurs  in 

the  cathode  region,  whereas  the  minor  voltage 

drop  (40–50  V)  is  shared  between  both  the 

positive column and anode region.

Fig. 2. Voltage-current characteristic of the 
APGD in helium 
 

apparatus  for  an  absorption line profile registration is shown in fig. 3. The discharge image was 

focused on entrance slit of a double grating monochromator (MDD 500x2) of high resolution. A 

Gaussian  instrumental  profile  was  ~  0.01  nm.  To  determine  the  concentrations  of  the  excited 

helium  atoms  the  absorption  spectroscopy  method  was  used  [8].  The  APGD  was  highlighted 

parallel to the cathode surface by a probing emission. A halogen incandescent lamp KGM-12-50 

was  used  as  probing  light  source  for  getting  the  absorption  lines  in  visible  spectral  region.  The 

original light source on the base of an arc with thermionic cathode [9] was used in the UV region. 

A  probing  emission  was  focused  in  plasma  volume  located  on  the  discharge  axes  and  than  was

collected on entrance slit of monochromator 

together  with  a  discharge  emission.  To 

obtain 

the  needed 

resolution 

in  axial 

direction  two  slit-diaphragms  were  used. 

The  electrical  signal  proportionate  to  the 

probing  emission  intensity  was  separated 

from  a  common  photomultiplier  signal  due 

to  both  the  modulation  of  the  probing 

emission  and  the  using  of  a  selective 

amplifier.  To  make  better  a  signal/noise 

ratio the synchronous detection was used as 

well. 

The  spectra  of  the  probing  emission 

before  and  after  passing  through  plasma 

were 

registered 

in 

the 

experiments. 

Calculation  of  the  excited  helium  atom 
concentrations  in  states  21S,  21P,  23S  and 
23P was fulfilled by numerical integration of 

the  measured  absorption  line  profiles  at  the 

the  experimental

concentration distribution was obtained due to a moving of discharge chamber by step motor in the 

discharge axes direction.  

 

 

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  

Experiments  were  performed  at  discharge  current  1  A.  This  value  of  discharge  current  was 

chosen due to a few causes. First, the sufficient cooling of cathode is provided in this case.  And 

second,  the  diameter  of  negative  glow  consist  of  about  8  mm.  That  allows  to  obtain  a  needed 

spatial  resolution  in  cathode  region  at  side-on  observation.  Normal  current  density  was  about  2 
A/cm2.  

In fig. 4a the dependence of the interelectrode voltage on nitrogen bulk concentration in helium 

flow is presented. Measurements were performed at interelectrode gap ~2.5 mm. As it is seen the 

interelectrode voltage is about 195 V when the helium flow does not contain a nitrogen admixture. 

This  voltage  value  is  pictured  in  fig.  4a  by  the  dotted  line.  But  the  adding  of  small  quantity  of 

nitrogen  in  helium  flow  leads  to  voltage  growth.  So  at  nitrogen  bulk  concentration  of  5%  the 

 

4

voltage is equal to about 330 V. That exceeds on 135 V  the interelectrode voltage observed in the 

APGD in helium. It is necessary to notice, current density almost does not change at nitrogen bulk 

concentrations less 5%, but it increases a few at higher ones.     

The increase of interelectrode voltage takes place non-uniformly along the interelectrode gap.

Fig. 4.  Dependences of interelectrode voltage on both (a) the nitrogen bulk concentration and (b) 
interelectrode gap at different nitrogen bulk concentrations. 

 

 

The voltage increase occurs in both cathode and anode region. This fact is confirmed by fig. 4b, 

where the voltage dependence on an interelectrode gap at different nitrogen bulk concentrations is 

presented. A change of gap does not lead to the visible changing in neither the cathode nor anode 

region. But in the case of the gap decrease the reducing of the positive column takes place. There 

is  no  positive  column  at  interelectrode  gap  less  than  0.5  mm.  This  confirms  that  the  voltage 

increase  is  connected  with  the  near-electrode  regions,  especially,  with  the  cathode  region. 

Probably,  the  changes  in  positive  column  at  nitrogen  adding  are  not  considerable,  because  the 

obtained experimental data are located on parallel lines (Fig. 4b). As it seen in fig. 4b the cathode 

fall value in helium APGD is close to one in the lower pressure glow discharge [7]. At adding of 

nitrogen in helium the cathode fall increases. At nitrogen bulk concentration about 0.5% cathode 

fall is already exceeding significant the one in pure nitrogen glow discharge.  

The  significant  increase  of  voltage  drop  takes  place  in  cathode  region  including  both  the 

cathode fall region and negative glow. The thickness of this region in axial direction consists of 

0.2-0.3  mm.  The  voltage  drop  increase  in  such  thin  layer  should  lead  to  considerable  growth  of 

volumetric heat generation and, as a consequence, a gas temperature increase. The gas temperature 

in the APGD was determined in experiments using the molecular bands in emission spectrum. The 

emission spectrum of the APGD plasma mainly consists of intensive lines of neutral helium atoms. 

However the more weak lines of the hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and other elements are observed 

as  well  (see  fig  5a,  for  example).  The

in helium  and (b) in helium-nitrogen mixture. 

The  gas  temperature  Tg  determined  using  the  relative  intensities  of  the  N2

+  band  in  negative 

glow of the APGD in helium is about 720 K. The adding of nitrogen into working gas helium leads 

to an increase of intensities of the electron systems of molecular nitrogen (Fig. 5b). This spectrum 

was registered in mixture containing 5% of nitrogen. If we compare these two spectra we will find 

the two other important differences. Firstly, it is obvious that the relative distribution of intensities 
+ band lines changed. The increase of intensities of molecular ion band lines with large 

of the N2

number shows the increase of gas temperature. And really, the gas temperature in negative glow 

increased  up  to  860  K  and  1055  K  at  values  of  nitrogen  bulk  concentrations  0.5%  and  5% 

correspondingly.   

A  second  interesting  fact  is  that  the  intensity  of  the  second  positive  system  of  nitrogen 

increases  more  quickly  in  comparison  with  one  of  the  first  negative  system  of  nitrogen  while 

concentration  of  nitrogen  in  mixture  is  increased.  The  bands  of  the  second  positive  system  of 

nitrogen  are  not  practically  observed  in  the  helium  APGD  (Fig.  4a).  At  the  same  time  the 

difference between the band intensities of both the first negative system and the second positive 

system of nitrogen becomes less in the APGD in helium-nitrogen mixture (Fig. 4b). It is necessary 

to  notice  that  the  intensities  of  nitrogen  bands  are  increasing  quickly  (in  one  hundred  times)  at 

 

increase  of  nitrogen  bulk  concentration  up  to  0.2%  (Fig. 5a). Therefore, a significant population 
+(B2Σ+) and the N2(С3Пu) levels takes place in the APGD in helium-nitrogen 

growth of both the N2

mixture. At higher bulk concentration the intensities of nitrogen bands are changed slightly.

The intensities of helium atom lines in mixture are changed in limits of 20% from its intensity

IV. DISCUSSION 

Let us make the analysis of the main reactions in the mentioned both APGDs. The low-exited 

levels  of  helium  atoms  play  an  important  role  in  stepped  ionization  processes.  The  role  of  this 

ionization  mechanism  in  the  APGD  is  more  significant  in  comparison  with  one  in  the  lower 
pressure glow discharge. In the electric fields E/N0 ≤ 10-15V·cm2 and at the ionization degree more 
10-5  a  stepped  ionization  in  the  APGD  plasma  is  more  important  than  a  direct  ionization  by 

electron collision even at free exit of light emission [11]. Naturally, a light reabsorption increases 

the  stepped  ionization  efficiency.  The  charged  particles  are  produced  in  follow  reactions  with 
participation of excited helium atoms He* [12]:  

He* + He* → He+ + He +e ,   

He*(n=3) + He → He2

Reaction (4) is in charge of a decrease of the excited helium atom concentrations at a nitrogen 
adding,  because  a  decrease  of  the  He*  atom  concentration  due  to  the  temperature  growth  is 

neglible. Since a significant part (a few tens of percents) of generated molecular ions of nitrogen is 
in the excited B2Σ+ state, the quenching of excited helium atoms is accompanied by emission in the 

first  negative  system  of  nitrogen.  The  generation  of  molecular  nitrogen  ion  is  a  result  of  a 
quenching process of the He2(23S u

+) molecule at collision of metastable helium atom with nitrogen 

molecule (reaction 5). Reactions (6), (7) describe the processes of recharge at collision of both the 

atomic and molecular helium with nitrogen molecules.  

Thus, the adding of nitrogen into helium leads to the reduction of concentration of both the low-

excited helium atoms and ions. As result the nitrogen becomes in charge of the maintenance of the 

APGD in helium-nitrogen mixture even in presence of small nitrogen admixture.

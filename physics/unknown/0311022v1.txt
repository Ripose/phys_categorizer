ABSTRACT 

The essential feature of the method is the employment of elasto-magnetic resonance spectroscopy 

(EMRS) [1,2] for precise measurement of the absorption of transverse elastic waves introduced 

into a biological sample. Such a measurement can be accomplished by combining the EMRS 

method with such methods, in which collective dislocations of spins are induced by external 

physical factors, e.g. variable electric field, strong magnetic field gradient or longitudinal elastic 

wave. This has been illustrated herein on the example of Electrical Mobility Magnetic Resonance 

Spectroscopy (EMMRS) [3]. 

INTRODUCTION 

The imaging of the shear coefficient distribution (of a longitudinal or transverse wave) has 

become an important diagnostic tool and can be accomplished using the method of nuclear 

magnetic resonance (MRE) [2,4-23], as well as ultrasonic methods (Sonoelasticity) [24-43]. In 

recent years, several new methods were proposed for determining mechanical properties of 

tissues, as regards both magnetic resonance [26,27] and ultrasonic methods [46]. Elastography 

has found numerous applications in medical diagnostics, e.g. for identification of neoplastic 

tumours of the breast, prostate, brain or liver, the rigidity of which generally differs markedly 

from that typical of healthy surrounding tissues [11,14], in hypothermia [13,17], palpation of the 

brain [11], surgical interventions, sports medicine (e.g. for determination of muscular tension) 

[18] etc.  

The diagnostic potential and specificity of the methods mentioned above can be substantially 

expanded by the determination of additional physical parameters, such as viscosity or the 

1 

coefficient of elastic waves attenuation in the matter. So far, these parameters were determined in 

several different ways: i) by determining the local shear waves length in the medium and, hence, 

evaluating the amplitude of the dislocation of the medium elements; as a result, by adjusting to a 

suitable theoretical model, elasticity coefficients of the medium for a transverse wave could be 

determined [47], mainly by the MR methods, ii) by measuring the phase propagation velocity of 

shear waves and using correlation techniques of calculations [42], or by the use of ultrasonic 

methods based of the Doppler effect. 

In the present work, a completely novel method has been proposed, which permits the 

determination of the local value of the absorption coefficient of a shear wave in the medium, 

based on the combination of the EMRS and EMMRS methods. 

THE PRINCIPLES OF THE METOD 

r

The method proposed is based on the measurement of phase changes, 

DF, of the transverse 

magnetization component. The transverse magnetization phase changes are proportional to the 

scalar product of the amplitude of the magnetic field gradient 

 and the effective displacement 

r
0G

of the paramagnetic elements 

 in the sample, caused by the above-mentioned factors. The 

effective dislocation of spins is the superposition of a dislocation evoked by a shear wave 

propagating in the sample, 

, and the dislocation induced by an external force causing 

collective spin dislocation, 

, within the whole sample. 

We assume that the magnetic field gradient is given by

Fig. 1. DF as a function of relative frequencies: a  = wx /wG, b  = wF /wG. Maximum changes in transverse 

magnetization occur when a  = b  = 1, i.e. wG  = wF  = wx . 

 

These phase changes described by eq. (1) are time-independent, and display the character of a 

triple resonance (Fig. 1.) (maximum changes for  wG =  wF =  wx) and spatial selectivity. This 

facilitates precise determination of their spatial dependence, and allows to: i) calibrate the 

selected methods, ii) sweep the sample investigated by changing the phase or frequency of factors 

which force the movement, iii) sweep the sample by changing the frequency of the magnetic field 

gradient, iv) measure the viscoelastic properties of the sample, v) image the spatial distribution of 

the attenuation coefficient of shear wave with angular frequency  w propagated in the sample; if 

one knows the distribution of the elasticity and the electrical mobility of the charged 

paramagnetic elements (ions, chemical radicals).

THE FORMS OF THE FORCING FACTOR 

The external factor inducing the collective spin dislocation may originate, as already mentioned, 

from: i) an electric field [3], ii) a strong magnetic field gradient [48,49] (then, the Stern-Gerlach 

are possible (see Table 1.). The marks there are: 

interaction is present), iii) a very long elastic wave. Therefore, the following forms of this factor 
0Er - the amplitude of the electric field with 
r
0,SGG

frequency  wE applied to the sample investigated, 

- the amplitude of the strong applied 

magnetic field gradient with frequency  wSG, 

0ur - the amplitude of the long elastic wave with 

frequency wu; jE ,  jSG, ju - the phases of the electric field, magnetic field gradient, and the 

elastic wave, respectively.

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ATTENUATION COEFFICIENT 

Since the external force, 

, causes the collective movement of spins in the whole sample 

r
)(tF

volume, i.e. independent of the position on the shear wave propagation direction (the x-axis), the 

measurement can be carried out as follows.  

 

Fig. 2.   The method of measuring the shear wave attenuation coefficient in the sample investigated.  Df 

denotes phase changes of the transverse magnetization component, 

x  is the direction of shear wave 

propagation in space,  Dx  is the spatial resolution of the method (the minimum segment of the sample, 

along which the phase change difference,  df  =  Df 1  -  Df2, can be measured,  j1,  j2 are different of 

individual runs of functions  Df1(x), Df2(x). One should note the proportionality of the  df changes to the 

external factor, 

, inducing the collective spin movement within the sample.

Let us choose a local minimum (or local maximum) of the function as its characteristic point. By 

changing the elastic wave phase by  Djx or slightly changing the gradient frequency by  DwG, or 

changing both quantities, we succeed in the dislocation of the chosen minimum of the function 

(i.e. we dislocate the point which is the source of the MR response) by Dx (see Fig. 2). 

Next, by changing the amplitude of the factor which dislocates the spins within the whole sample 
r , the chosen minimum can be 
0F

, which is performed by changing the value of 

volume, 

r
0,Fz

brought to a zero value. Since the changes in the transverse magnetization component are 

proportional to the dislocation induced by the external factor, 

changes can be measured by measuring the amplitude, 

r
)(tF

, the magnetization phase 
r , or by the direct measurement of 
0F

magnetization phase changes,  DF. By repeating this procedure many times, we will be able to 

sweep the selected area of the sample and determine its visco-elastic properties. 

EXPECTED RESULTS 

 
Based on data given by Muthupillai et al. [9]: Dx ~ 50 nm, x0  ~ 1m m, Vmech  ~ 3 m/s, w G  ~ 2p
(cid:215) 500 
Hz and assuming standard values of technical parameters in MR tomographs:  G0  ~ 23 · 10-3 T/m, 

g = 42,58 Hz/T, a conclusion can be drawn that it is possible to determine phase changes of the 
transverse magnetization component of the order of  dF =  |DF1  - DF2|  ~ 10 -4  ‚ 10-5 deg at an 
accumulation of n = 10 ‚

 20.  

The elastic wave phase change or/and a slight off-tuning from the resonance may result in spatial 

dislocation of the observation point which is the source of the MR response and, hence, it 

becomes possible to measure the local elastic wave attenuation coefficient in the medium. For 

example, by changing the elastic wave phase by about  Djx  = 0.05  degree or the magnetic field 
(cid:215) 0.001 Hz, one can determine phase changes on a length of 
gradient frequency by about DwG  ~ 2p
the order of Dx ~ 10-7 m. This is equivalent to the spatial resolution of the method of the order of 

some tens of a micrometer.  

Taking into account the technical parameters of modern MRI methods, such as an ability to 

measure relative phase changes of the transverse magnetization component of the order of 10
‚ 10-5 degrees, it is possible to measure the changes in the absorption coefficient of the order of 

-4 

6 

Dm ~ 10-3 ‚

 10-4 dB/cm with the above-given resolution Dx. The limitations involved in the use of 

the method result from the dependence of the magnetization phase changes on the scalar product

(

). In view of the absorption of the considered transverse elastic wave in the sample, the 

resolution of the method will decrease together with the decrease of the amplitude 

r

.  

CONCLUSIONS 

This method, based on the combination of EMRS and EMMRS, allows precise determination and 

imaging of the absorption coefficient by the dislocation-phase transformation of the transverse 

magnetization component,  DF, thus substantially improving the research and application 

potential of the MRI methods [50].

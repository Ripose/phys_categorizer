Abstract.  An  absolutely  secure,  fast,  inexpensive,  robust,  maintenance-free  and  low-power-

consumption communication is proposed. The states of the information bit are represented by two

resistance values. The sender and the receiver have such resistors available and they randomly select

and connect one of them to the channel at the beginning of each clock period. The thermal noise

voltage and current can be observed but Kirchoff's law provides only a second-order equation. A

secure bit is communicated when the actual resistance values at the sender's side and the receiver's

side differ. Then the second order equation yields the two resistance values but the eavesdropper is

unable to determine the actual locations of the resistors and to find out the state of the sender's bit.
The receiver knows that the sender has the inverse of his bit, similarly to quantum entanglement.

The  eavesdropper  can  decode  the  message  if,  for  each  bits,  she  inject  current  in  the  wire  and

measures the voltage change and the current changes in the two directions. However, in this way she

gets discovered by the very first bit she decodes. Instead of thermal noise, proper external noise

generators should be used when the communication is not aimed to be stealth.

Keywords:  Secure  communication;  stealth  communication;  classical  information;  eavesdropper

detection; classical bit entanglement.

1. Introduction

Much  effort  has  been  spent  to  find  a  data  communication  methods  which  is  absolutely  secure.

Quantum key distribution offers methods where the eavesdropper gets discovered, as soon as she

extracts a certain number of (noisy) bits (the number depends on the specific method), because of

the  extra  noise  she  is  introducing  in  the  communication  channel.  Thus  quantum  encryption  is

considered  to  be  absolutely  secure.  However  they  are  expensive,  slow,  maintenance-needy,  and

work only for short distances without a repeater.

Concerning  classical  physical  information,  there  is  a  widespread  opinion  that  classical

information channels cannot be made secure. Such an opinion sounds reasonable because either the

collapse  of  wavefunction  during  measurement or the quantum  no-cloning  theorem,  which  make

quantum  encryption  secure,  do  not  hold  for  classical  information.  Concerning  today's  classical

encryptions,  the  weak  point  of  the  generally  used  mathematical  methods  is  that  the  sender  and

receiver have to somehow share the key they will use to encode and decode the message. They have
to somehow share this key while the eavesdropper is recording the communication between them.

To  reach  this  goal,  they  start  with  common  public  information,  which  they  are  mathematically

manipulating in a successive way, and sending it to/back several times until they are able to extract

the key. The problem with this approach is that the eavesdropper records everything and, though she

has  less  information  because  she  is  only  a  passive  observer,  when  she  has  a  sufficiently  great

computational  power  at  hand  (such  as  a  fictional  quantum  computer  for  factoring),  she  can  also

extract the key. Therefore, those encryption methods (such as RSA encryption systems [1,2]), where

the sender and receiver share some public information about the key, are not absolutely secure.

The cipher to be described in this paper provides absolute security with classical information and

it is based on the simultaneous physical encrypting of the information by both the sender and the
receiver.  It  is  relevant  to  mention  that  we  have  made  an  earlier  mathematical  attempt  to  double
encrypt the message while bouncing it between the sender and receiver; the mathematical operator

version  of  double-padlock  method  [3].  However,  the  finding  of  proper  encryption  (padlock)

operators satisfying the necessary mathematical conditions of working/security is hopeless [2] with
classical information, unless we use operators like those of RSA encryption systems [1], where there
is a common public knowledge about the key that is making the cipher not absolutely secure. On the
other  hand,  quantum  operators  can  be  applied  easily  and  the  result  is  a  quantum  communication

scheme  more  secure  than  earlier  quantum  key  distribution  systems  [4].  However,  even  at  this

improved quantum case, the eavesdropper can extract many noisy bits until she will be discovered

with a reasonable probability [5].

Another attempt [6] with classical (and quantum) information, stealth  communication, which is a

zero-signal-power  communication  method  utilizing  parametric  modulation  of  the  classical  or

quantum noise in the information channel, can provide absolute security for radio waves however

only in thermal equilibrium. If the eavesdropper uses cooled devices, she can hide for a longer time

period than one bit.

In the present paper, a new classical physical method is shown to make absolutely secure data

transfer  with  classical  information  where,  similarly  to  the  double-padlock  systems  [3,4],  the
information is encrypted by both the sender and the receiver. However the way of communication is

very different from the double-padlock system, and it is very special, because these encryptions take

place simultaneously, and because the information is carried by two physical quantities: voltage and

current. The method succeeds to achieve the difficult goal that there is no public knowledge about

the  keys,  which  are  independent  random  sequences  of  the  numbers  0  and  1  and  independent

Gaussian voltage noises generated locally at the two sides; they are not communicated to anywhere

and they are not saved, either. These properties makes the communication absolute secure.

While this communication is also absolutely secure like quantum communication, there are some

major advantages compared to it: this communication is inexpensive to set up; robust; maintenance-

free;  the  eavesdropper  is  recognized  after  she  extracts  a  single  bit;  it  works  for  much  longer

distances without the need of repeaters; or if it is used for the same distance as the range of quantum

communication, it is much faster.

2. Thermal noise voltage and current of two parallel resistors

For  the  sake  of  readers  unfamiliar  with  thermal  noise  in  resistors,  here  we  present  some  simple
considerations  and  well-known  facts  [7].  In  thermal  equilibrium,  at  temperature  T ,  in  the  low-
frequency limit, the power density spectrum of the thermal noise voltage on an open-ended resistor
R is given by the Johnson formula:

  Su, th ( f ) = 4kTR

(1)

If the two ends of the resistor are shorted with a wire then, due to Ohm's law, the current in this loop

Let us suppose that we have two resistors,  R0 and  R1, which are connected parallel. Then from Eq. 1
and the Kirchoff's laws it follows that the power density spectrum of the resultant noise voltage on

will be

Si, th ( f ) =
  

4kT
R

.

the two parallel resistors will be:

Su, R ||( f ) = 4kT
  

R0 R1
R0 + R1

.

consisting of the two resistors is:

Si, R ||( f ) =
  

4kT
R0 + R1

From Eq. 2, it follows that the power density spectrum of the noise current flowing through the loop

(2)

3. Secure, threefold-encrypted Kirchoff-loop-Johnson-noise (KLJN) cipher

3.1 Physical base

Let  us  suppose  that  the  sender  and  the  receiver  have  one  resistor  each  and  these  resistors  are

connected parallel by a pair of wires, which represent the information channel between the sender

and the receiver. The eavesdropper has no information about the resistances of these resistors. The
key questions are:

i) Can the eavesdropper find out the resistance values from voltage and current measurements?

ii) If yes, can she find out the location of the resistances; which resistor is at the sender and which

one is at the receiver?

The answer to question i) is yes. By measuring the current in the wire and the voltage between the

wires, the eavesdropper can determine  Su, R ||( f ) and  Si, R ||( f ) . Then using Eqs. 3,4 she can set up a
second order equation and the two solutions provide the two resistance values. However, the answer

to question ii) is no and this answer guarantees the absolute security of the KLJN cipher. There is no

way to determine the exact location of these resistances. The specific scaling between the resistance

and  the  thermal  noise  voltage  and  current  (see Eqs.  1,2)  makes  it  sure  that  the  net  energy  flow

between  the  sender  and  the  receiver  is  zero,  thus  even  the  Pointing  vector,  or  similar  cross-

correlation measures, provide zero information about the location.

3.2 The absolutely secure communication scheme

Accordingly, the absolute secure classical communication scheme utilizing Kirchoff laws and

Johnson noise is shown in Fig. 1. The information channel is a wire. The sent information bit is

carried  by  the  sender's  choice  of  resistor  Rs  selected  from  two  significantly  different  values,
  R0 << R1 , where the two values represent that two states of the information bit (0 and 1). The sender
encrypts this message with the random generator voltage U S (t) of the actual resistor. The receiver
double-encrypts the message by using his randomly chosen resistor RR , which (for simplicity but not
necessarily) can selected from the same set of two resistance values and the corresponding random

generator voltage U R(t) . At each clock period, a new information bit is sent and, at the same time,
the receiver's resistance is changing randomly between the two values. The clock period is selected

so that a sufficiently good statistics can be made on the measured noise voltage or current in the
channel. The random voltage generators are either the Johnson noises of the resistors or they are

artificial noise generator with much larger noise voltage but with the same linear scaling relation

between  the  resistance  and  the  noise  voltage  spectrum  as  that  of  Johnson  noise.  We  call  this  a
threefold  encryption  scheme  because  the  data  are  encrypted  by  three  independent  stochastic
processes: the two noise voltage generators and the resistance at the receiver. Because the sender and
receiver know their own resistor value they can both determine the resistor value at the other side by
measuring either the voltage or the current and using Eq. 3 or 4, respectively. It is necessary that the
sender also determines the resistance value at the other side and that can be used for a simultaneous
two-way communication, see below.

The eavesdropper may also have access to the measurement of the voltage and current in the

channel, see Figure 2, however this information is not enough to break the code. As we have shown

it above, by measuring both the voltage and current in the channel, she can extract only the two

momentary resistance values however she is unable to locate the resistors when their resistances are

different, consequently she cannot decide if the sender is communicating 0 or 1.

3.3. Non-secure bits and simultaneous two-way communication.

However,  if  both  the  sender  and  receiver  use  the  same  resistance  value,  the  eavesdropper  can

recognize that fact, so she can find out the resistor value and the status of the information bit at the

sender. Thus such a bit is not secure and cannot be used. Because on the average, in 50% of the

cases, the sender's bit and receiver's one will be different, we can use only that 50% of the bits for
communication. Similar situations are well known in classical and quantum communication and it is

easy to make use of the successfully communicated secure bits because the sender is aware of the

security or non-security of the communicated bit. For example, after a whole random sequence is

sent, it is possible to announce through a public channel which secure bits forms the message and

what  is  their  proper  order.  In  this  way,  both  the  sender  and  the  receiver  can  simultaneously

communicate a random message and the random message will be the inverse of each other at the two

sides, similarly to quantum-entanglement in quantum information processing. Thus also the receiver

can send information, simultaneously; therefore both sides can simultaneously act as senders and

receivers.  In  this  way  the  50%  bit  loss  due  to  the  security  requirement  is  made  up  by  the

simultaneous operation mode.

3.4 External noise generators

We have already mentioned above that proper external noise generators can and should also be used

because the same considerations hold for resistances and the corresponding external noise voltage
generators  that  follow  the  same  scaling  law  between  the  resistance  and  the  mean-square  voltage
noise as that of the thermal noise:

  Su, th ( f ) = VR 

,

(5)

where  V  is the scaling coefficient and its value has to be equal at the senders and the receiver's
sides. Then all considerations and conclusions described above remain valid including the absolute
security. The advantage of using external noise generators is that  V  can be arbitrarily large instead

of the  4kT  value resulting in the case of thermal noise. Thus, with using external noise generator of
large  V  makes the communication free of background noise effects, which is a strong advantage
compared  to  quantum  communication  where  the  background  noise  of  the  quantum  source,  the

channel  and  the  detectors  is  significantly  reducing  performance  and  compromising  security.  The

only advantage of the thermal noise driving originally shown is that it is a stealth  communication

method using the background noise in the channel, see [6]. On the other hand, Figure 1 shows the

way to provide absolute security for the stealth communication arrangement with wire connection

which has not been achieved in the original proposal of secure communication [6].

4. Breaking the code and the immediate detection of the eavesdropper

It is possible to break the KLJN cipher if the eavesdropper injects a small stochastic current   DI E (t)
into the channel and determines the following crosscorrelation functions:

CES = DI E (t)DI ES (t)
  

and 

CES = DI E (t)DI ES (t)   ,
  

where    DI ES (t)   and    DI ES (t)   are  the  induced  current  changes  by  the  induced  voltage  change
  DU E,Ch (t) and the linear response. Obviously, the following rule due to Kirchoff's law allows the
determination of the information bit:

 

  RR / RS = CES / CER  , 

where  RS  and  RR  are the actual resistances at the sender and the receiver, respectively. The easiest
way to uncover the eavesdropper is to use a public channel to exchange and compare the measured
current  values  at  the  sender  and  the  receiver.  In  this  case,  the  eavesdropper  is  immediately
discovered,  before  she  can  make  any  statistics,  because  she  needs  to  cause  a  measurable  current
difference while the entangled bits are communicated. Thus the eavesdropper has only one choice:
instead using small current and making a statistics, to inject a fast and large current spike in the
channel and use the relation

(6)

(7)

(8)

  RR / RS = DI ES / DI ER

to extract the bit values. Thus the eavesdropper can extract a single bit but she gets immediately

uncovered. Therefore the communication is absolutely secure.

5. Practical questions: speed, range and cost

There are two factors limiting speed and range. Firstly, Kirchoff's laws should hold. That means that

  L << l max = c / fmax    

or

  fmaxL << c

,

(9)

where  L ,  fmax  and  c are the range, the maximal frequency bandwidth and the velocity of EM waves
in the wire, respectively. Secondly, the clock  frequency (effective  bandwidth)  fc  should  be  low-
enough for a reasonably good noise statistics to securely distinguish the resistors    R0 << R1 ,  thus
  fc << fmax . For this reason, it is much more efficient to use the measurement of the mean-square
noise voltage and current which are the integral of the corresponding power density spectra [7].

For  a  practical  estimation,  let  us  suppose  that    c = 2 *108   meter/s  ,    fmaxL = 0.1* c  ,  and
  fc = 0.1* fmax .  Then  the  effective  bandwidth-distance  product   fcL = 2 *106   meterHz.  This  is
slightly better than present quantum communicator arrangements [8].

However,  there  is  a  simple  and  inexpensive  way  to  radically  improve  speed.  Because  this
communicator is extremely inexpensive, 100-1000 times cheaper than quantum communicators of

the similar performance, it is natural to build parallel channels to enhance speed and security. Using

chip technology and a multi-wire cable with 100 wires, the speed of the system can be increased by
a factor of 100 and the price would still be below the price of a quantum communicator. Moreover,
the  security  can  further  be  enhanced  because  the  information  can  be  cross-encrypted  among  the
wires so, if the eavesdropper would read out a single bit from a single wire, that would still be zero
bit of information without reading our the other 99 wires.
Finally  we  should  mention  that  this  technology  is  not  only  inexpensive  but  also  very  robust  and
virtually maintenance-free compared to quantum communicators, moreover it consumes much lower
power.  It  is  very  robust:  vibrations,  dust,  temperature  gradients  and  material  ageing,  which  are
serious problems in quantum communication, cause no problem here.

6. Summary

In this Letter, we outlined a new way of communication through a wire. The main advantages of this

method are that it is absolutely secure moreover it is using classical information in the form that is

fast, inexpensive, robust (vibration, dust, temperature and aging resistant), maintenance free and it

has low power consumption. If it is applied for the same range as a secure quantum communicator,

its speed can easily be made 100 times greater; or alternatively, at the same speed it can go for a 100

times longer distance without the need of repeater stations. The communication can also use stealth

mode, when the noise generators are the thermal noise of the resistors.

Absolute secure classical communication scheme utilizing Kirchoff laws and a threefold encryption.

The information channel is a wire. The message is carried by the sender's choice of resistor value.
The sender encrypts this message the random generator voltage US.. The receiver double-encrypts
the message by using his randomly chosen resistor RR and the random generator voltage UR. The
random voltage generators are either the Johnson noises of the resistors or artificial noise generator

with much larger noise voltage but with the same scaling relation between the resistance and the
noise  voltage  spectrum  as  that  of  Johnson  noise.  The  eavesdropper  may  have  access  to  the

measurement of the voltage and current in the channel, however this information is not enough to

Circuit models for the calculation of the channel voltage and current via the Kirchoff's law and the

Johnson  noise  equation.  The  eavesdropper  can  measure  the  voltage  and  the  current  and,  after

determining the spectra she can derive the resistor values from Eqs. 3 and 4, but not their location.

Breaking into the system needs to inject a current in the channel. The current has to have different

dynamical and statistical characteristics than the voltage noises used by the sender and the receiver.

However, as soon as the eavesdropper extracts a single bit her action gets discovered because the
sender and the received observe the same deviations in the voltage, the current and their statistical
properties.

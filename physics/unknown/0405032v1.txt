Abstract 

Seismic  data  users  and  people  managing  a  sesimic  network  are  both  interested  in  the 

potentiality  of  the  data,  with  the  difference  that  the  former  look  at  stability,  the  second  at 

improvements. In this work we measure the performances of the Italian Telemetered Seismic 

Network in 1985-2002 by defining basic significant parameters and studying their evolution 

during the years. Then, we deal with the geological methods used to characterise or to plan a 

seismic  station  deployment  in  a  few  cases.  Last,  we  define  the  gain  of  the  network  as  the 

percentage of located earthquakes with respect to the total recorded earthquakes. By analysing 

the distribution of non-located (“missed”) earthquakes, we suggest possible actions to take in 

order to increase the gain.  

Results show that completeness magnitude is 2.4 in the average over the analysed period, 

and  it  can  be  as  low  as  2.2  when  we  consider  non-located  earthquakes  as  well.  Parameters 

such  as  the  distance  between  an  earthquake  and  the  closest  station,  and  the  RMS  location 

decrease with time, reflecting improvements in the location quality. Methods for geologic and 

seismological  characterisation  of  a  possible  station  site  also  proved  to  be  effective.  Finally, 

we  represent  the  number  of  missed  earthquakes  at  each  station,  showing  that  nine  stations 

control  more  that  50%  of  all  missed  earthquakes,  and  suggesting  areas  in  Italy  where  the 

network might be easily improved.

Introduction 

Seismic data analysis at the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) begins 

as soon as the data are acquired, going from automatic processing for very rapid earthquake 

response  to  analysts  review  for  earthquake  catalogues  and  quality  control.  Immediate 

earthquake information for Italy and surrounding areas includes location, magnitude, expected 

damage, and, for larger events, source description and historical analysis. INGV then reports 

earthquake information to public and private agencies. 

On a daily basis, analysts revise the previously reported events and read new ones, picking 

phases,  locating  the  events,  and  reporting  magnitude.  In  addition  to  local  and  regional 

earthquake  location,  analysts  read  teleseismic  phases.  All  this work  converges  into  standard 

location reports commonly called “seismic bulletins”.  

Over the past 20 years, the INGV has invested in the development of the software needed 

for automated, real-time earthquake analysis. Specifically, in the very latest years the station 

density,  the  instrumentation  quality,  and  the  software  capabilities  strongly  increased;  this 

resulted  in  greater  quality,  quantity,  and  immediacy  of  earthquake  locations.  Analogue 

transmission  and  chemical  paper  recordings  gave  up  to  digital  connections  and  broadband 

seismometers, improving the accuracy of readings, whereas the greater station density allows 

recognising earthquake sources with more details.  

The long-lasting dataset allows studying changes of seismicity parameters with time, e.g., 

b-value,  moment  release  rate,  and  clustering  properties,  and  the  amount  of  new  analyses 

strictly follows the increase of data quality. The knowledge of human induced changes thus 

assumes a great importance in planning the analyses and evaluating the results.  

Parallel to these improvements in software and instrumentation, in the past 10-12 years a 

great  effort  has  been  made  to  come  up  to  good  standards  in  the  process  of  site  selection 

through  detailed  geological  surveys.  This  process  is  very  important,  because  accounting  for 

 

2

the geology of a potential site can improve the station efficiency maximizing the return of the 

above-described technological improvements.  

This  work  analyses  the  temporal  changes  of  quantities  that  depend  on  the  ongoing 

transformations,  e.g.,  minimum  hypocentral  distance,  completeness  magnitude,  and  RMS 

among the others. In addition, we also illustrate how the criteria of choosing installation sites 

changed  with  time,  showing  a  few  examples  of  some  of  the  most  interesting  geological 

situations  observed  in  the  field  since  when  the  standard  investigations  at  the  sites  are 

operating.  In  order  to  highlight  the  changes  due  to  the  network,  like  station  density  and 

recording quality, we relocate 1985-2002 earthquakes adopting year-2004 criteria (minimum 

number  of  phases,  weights,  etc.)  over  the  whole  dataset.  Such  information  gain  interest 

because of the widespread availability of data due to pagers, e-mail, and the www.  

Data and Instrumentation 

The Italian Telemetered Seismic Network 

The Italian Telemetered Seismic Network (ITSN) has been continuously operating short-

period  instrumentation  since  the  year  1980.  During  the  years,  there  have  been  two  major 

developments phases. The first occurred during the years 1981-1984: the network moved to 

digital  acquisition  (Taccetti  &  Mele,  1989;  Boschi  et  al.,  1990),  and  the  station  density 

strongly  increased  (De  Simoni,  1987).  The  second  has  been  occurring  since  the  year  2002: 

transmission  changed  from  analogue  to  digital (Badiali  and  Mele,  2000), including satellite, 

and  new  kind  of  instruments  have  been  deployed,  mostly  broadband.  Figure  1  shows  the 

location  of  seismic  stations  in  1984  and  in  2002,  in  between  the  two  largest  development 

phases.  

The Dataset 

We dealt with all the local and regional data recorded by the ITSN (Barba et  al., 1995a; 

1995b)  from  1  January  1985  to  31  August  2002  (hereinafter  1985-2002).  “All  data”  means 

that we did not select any subset a priori. More specifically, we used 1) earthquakes that have 

 

3

been located, 2) earthquakes that had no enough data to give a reliable location, and 3) sparse 

readings where the S-P time and magnitude are reliable. In all, the specified data set consists 

of  113199  seismic  events,  of  which  45191  have  been  reliably  located,  whereas  68008  are 

either  poorly  located  or  sparse  phase  readings.  Among  these  latter  events,  the  greatest 

majority (66698) have reliable S-P time reading at the closest station. These data get together 

into  the  public  seismic  bulletins,  available  through  the  www  (http://www.ingv.it/)  and  ftp 

(ftp://ftp.ingv.it/bollet/). 

Completeness magnitude 

Events  in  the  catalogue  have  magnitudes  between  M  ~  1.5  and  M  ~  6.0.  Completeness 

magnitude  is  somewhat  troublesome  to  establish  because  it  depends  on  area,  time,  and 

location quality. We used the maximum of the derivative of frequency magnitude distribution 

to derive the completeness magnitude for the whole dataset. We computed the completeness 

magnitude for the whole catalogue (1985-2002), and for two sub-catalogues, 1985-1993 and 

1997-2002,  respectively.  We  found  M  2.4  for  located  earthquake,  whereas  poorly-  or  not-

locatable events are complete from magnitude M 2.2. Only for the years 1997-2002, we find 

the  completeness  magnitude  for  located  earthquakes  to  be  M  2.3,  thus  reflecting  the 

improvement in the network geometry in the latter years.  

On the importance of poorly-located events 

The poorly-located and the not-locatable earthquakes (“missed” earthquakes) constitute the 

majority of events in the dataset. We call here “poorly-located” the local events defined by the 

seismic analysts as such. On the other side, “not-locatable” are local earthquakes with seven 

phase readings or less, that have both P- and S-wave readings at the closest station. If the S-

wave  is  not  reliable  at  the  closest  station  then  we  completely  discard  the  event  from  the 

dataset.  Some  analysis  can  still  successfully  make  use  of  such  data  if  the  location  accuracy 

concerns less than magnitude completeness. For example, analysing such data might be very 

 

4

useful in assessing the detection capabilities of the network, or in suggesting improvement for 

the network geometry.  

For sake of simplicity, we group together the poorly-located and the not locatable events, 

referring to them just as the poorly-located events. We assume as event parameters – in place 

of  origin  time  and  hypocentral  coordinates  –  the  arrival  time  of  earliest  P-wave,  the 

coordinates, and the S-P time difference, all relative to the closest seismic station. 

Looking inside seismic bulletins 

Increasing the seismic station number (from 41 in the year 1984 to more than 100 in year 

2002)  has  produced  a  huge  quantity  of  low-magnitude  recordings.  Percentage  of  magnitude 

M<= 2.5 events increased from 20% in 1982 up to 62% in 2002. This increase suggests that 

ITSN data quality improved with time, but it hardly quantifies such improvement. Thus, we 

study here how the possible indicators of data quality, like the location RMS, the minimum 

and  maximum  hypocentral  distance,  and  so  on,  changed  with  time.  These  changes  were 

mostly due to the network geometry and to the site characteristics. 

Variation of minimum and maximum distance with time 

In order to understand how the location quality improved with time, we first assume that 

the error on hypocentral coordinates decreases with the distance between the earthquake and 

the  closest  station  that  recorded  it.  Here,  we  are  neglecting  the  influence  of  the  velocity 

model,  and  we  are  assuming  that  the  network  geometry  might  be  considered  approximately 

constant around the hypocenter. We selected 36942 local events with minimum hypocentral 

distance  less  than  50  km  occurred  from  January  1985  to  August  2002.  Then  we  considered 

monthly averages of the minimum distance and the associated standard deviation. We observe 

(continuous line in Figure 2) that minimum distance decreased 1.4 km from 24.3 km to 22.9 

km  in  the  average  on  the  whole  Italian  territory.  Apparently,  this  decrement  might  be 

surprisingly  small,  but  it  is  not  if  we  consider  that  the  ITSN  also  developed  in  areas  with 

 

5

previous little instrumental coverage, and that coastal earthquakes contribute to the average, 

too. If we consider only areas that were already properly monitored,  we  find  that  minimum 

distance decreases much more. For example, 6 km in the Northern Apennines (5774 events, 

line “a” in Figure 3), 5 km in the Central Apennines (10866 events, line “b”), and even 15 km 

in  the  Matese-Irpinia,  Southern  Apennines  (3306  events,  line  “c”).  In  this  last  case,  the 

Sannio-Matese local seismic network (Di Maro & Marchetti, 1992) was incorporated into the 

ITSN,  lowering  the  station  spacing  to  15-20  km.  Changing  the  50-km  cut-off  to  other 

distances  produces  similar  results.  Therefore,  we  can  conclude  that  the  Network  was 

successfully  developed  in  the  well-known  hazardous  areas,  whereas  a  fair  expansion  was 

brought forth in less hazardous (or less known) areas.  

As  a  second  important  issue,  we  want  to  verify  how  the  detectability  of  an  earthquake 

improves  with  time.  There  are  two  ways  to  define  detectability.  At  short  distances,  we  say 

than an earthquake is detectable if it has reliable P- and S-wave arrival time readings at the 

closest  station,  so  detectability  improves  if  the  number  of  low-magnitude  earthquakes  with 

both  P-  and  S-readings  increases.  It  actually  improves,  increasing  the  percentage  of  low-

magnitude  events  from  20%  to  62%  as  above  described.  The  second  possible  definition 

concerns  the  maximum  distance  at  which  the  earthquake  gives  reliable  P-readings.  Many 

factors  affect  the  so  defined  detectability:  the  network  density  (only  at  short  distances),  the 

quality of the geological sites, the efficiency of transmission lines, the instrument sensitivity, 

and  the  reliability  of  the  detection  algorithm.  We  selected  40536  events,  with  maximum 

distance less than 600 km, occurred from January 1985 to August 2002, and plotted monthly 

averages  of  the  maximum  distance.  We  can  observe  (continuous  line  in  Figure  4)  that 

maximum distance slightly decreases until year 1997, and it slightly increases after the same 

year. This result suggests that the only intervening factor in 1985-2002 has been the network 

density, while the other characteristics have been nearly unchanged. We notice that after 2002 

great changes occurred in all the other areas, as described in the Network section: digital was 

 

6

used  instead  of  analogue  transmission,  many  broadband  instruments  were  deployed,  and 

digitisation from 16 bit moved to 24 bit. In addition, a strongly improved detection algorithm 

is running since 2002. 

Variation of RMS with time 

The  RMS  of  travel-time  residuals  is  commonly  used  to  assess  the  reliability  of  the 

earthquake  location.  This  practice  suffers  of  well-known  problems,  because  a  minimum  of 

RMS  does  not  insure  a  realistic  solution.  A  low  RMS  is  easily  achieved  with  few  phase 

readings, whereas a good location often is not. Despite of these limitations, RMS variations 

can indicate changes in the goodness of location, all the other conditions left constant. In this 

section, we describe how RMS varies with time, with magnitude and how it depends on the 

number of P- and S-readings actually used in locating the events.  

By representing monthly averages of the RMS travel-time residuals, we can see that RMS 

decreases with time until year 1997 (continuous and dashed lines in Figure 5). This reduction 

reflects the increase in station density through the years and the consequent improvement in 

location accuracy both for all-magnitude events (continuous line in Figure 5) and magnitude 

M>=3.3 events (dashed line). Since 1997, the RMS was approximately constant, confirming 

the  trend  in  station  number.  By  the  end  of  2002,  the  installed  stations  increased  from  90  to 

100. 

Magnitude  also  affects  RMS,  although  not  directly.  We  observe  that  RMS  is  nearly 

constant  (RMS  ≈0.6÷0.7)  for  events  of  magnitude  M>4.  For  lower  magnitudes,  the  RMS 

decreases, probably because of the fewer travel-time data involved in the earthquake location. 

This  result  confirms  that  fewer  phases  are  likely  to  produce  a  lower  RMS  with  a  possibly 

worse location accuracy. 

Dependence of RMS on the number of phases 

Finally, we verify how the number of P- and S-wave arrival-time data affect the RMS of 

the  solution.  Neglecting  the  events  located  with  very  few  data,  which  avoids  fictitious 

 

7

features, we can plot RMS averages versus the number of P- and S-wave arrival times. From 

Figure 6 we deduce that the minimum of RMS is reached for a number of P phase readings 

comprised  between  15  and  40.  For  more  than  40  P  phases,  the  RMS  is  nearly  constant, 

showing  that  additional  data  do  not  improve  the  RMS.  The  same  Figure  6  shows  that  the 

optimal number of S phases is 4, and that the use f more than 20 S phases does not improve 

the  RMS.  We  remember  that  these  are  “average”  results  and  that  might  therefore  vary  for 

specific areas or at the borders of the network. 

Geological characterisation of some ITSN station sites 

Methodology for station site characterisation 

The phases of development of the ITSN that have been observed during the years find their 

counterparts  in  the  process  of  selection  of  the  seismic  stations.  Indeed  part  of  the 

improvement in the quality of the “seismological datum” has to be related to more rigorous 

criteria of site selection. Following an early period in which a site was normally selected by a 

simple test of the signal with a portable recorder and by quick morphological observations, in 

1992 the INGV started a systematic geological and geomorphological survey (Cucci and Pirro 

1992,  1993)  along  with  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  seismic  noise  at  each  site.  This  important 

work allowed to 1) improve significantly the set of data available for each surveyed station of 

the  ITSN;  2)  try  to  link  the  geology  of  one  site  to  possible  anomalies  in  the  record  of  the 

seismic  waves  (different  signal  to  noise  ratios, capability  of  recording  seismic  events,  static 

residuals,  etc.);  3)  identify  the  best  possible  geological  conditions  at  sites  where  particular 

needs  suggested  to  move  the  seismometer;  4)  provide  useful  guidelines  to  be  followed  in 

In particular, in this article we will focus our attention on the geological characteristics of 

the sites and refer to Cimini et al. (1994) and Cucci et al. (1994) for the geophysical aspects of 

selecting new sites.  

the work. 

 

8

In theory, the best geological characteristics are those that supply the site with the lowest 

possible seismic noise. Consequently, the most frequent search is for competent rocks in low 

relief areas, along-depth continuity of outcrops, lack of fracturing, thin soil cover, absence of 

active  faults  and/or  slope  failure  processes  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site.  Nevertheless,  the 

geological characterisation is but one of the several features to be assessed when selecting a 

new site, so that often a favourable geological situation can be in conflict with other important 

logistic  needs  such  as  an  easy  access  to  the  site  or  the  availability  of  electricity  and  phone 

lines. This explains the complexity and variability of the situations that have been observed 

while surveying the sites of the ITSN. 

At  present,  we  collected  geological  data  regarding  more  than  thirty  already  existing 

seismic stations plus a number of sites for future stations. Our working methodology mainly 

follows two steps. In order to achieve a general overview of the study area we usually collect 

and analyse geological, hydrogeological and geomorphic data at regional scale (order of tens 

of kilometres from the site). The processing of these data provides 1:100000 scale maps and 

sections that allow recognising the most important geological structures. The second step of 

our  work  is  the  detailed  geological  survey  of  the  area  surrounding  the  site.  Each  outcrop  is 

briefly  described  in  terms  of  lithological  characteristics,  attitude,  state  of  fracturing  and 

possible displacements; further observations concerning the drainage pattern, erosion features 

and karst phenomena complete the survey. GPS measures provide elevation and coordinates 

of the site. The data collected in the field are often integrated by aerial photo analyses and by 

the stratigraphies of wells and boreholes. Geological maps and sections are the final product 

of the field survey; the scale used for the maps (1:5000) allows to put in evidence single ~20 

m-wide  outcrops  over  a  ~1  km2  large  area.  The  geological  section  shows  a  tentative 

reconstruction of the bedrock up to 200-300 metres below the site. 

At  present,  we  collected  geological  data  regarding  about  forty  existing  seismic  stations 

plus a number of sites for future stations. In the following, we show maps and sections of four 

 

9

ITSN  sites  that  are  representative  of  some  of  the  most  interesting  geological  situations 

observed in the field. 

Field cases 

Figure  7  shows  the  results  of  the  survey  at  the  FVI-Forni  Avoltri  station  in  the  Eastern 

Alps.  This  is  an  example  of  a  site  that  satisfies  many  of  the  above-mentioned  requirements 

and that exhibits scarce geological and/or  geomorphological  problems.  The  good  geological 

quality of this location is also confirmed by the seismic noise recorded at the site (Cucci et al. 

1994). 

Figure  8  shows  a  geological  section  at  the  site  RFI,  on  the  volcanic  edifice  of 

Roccamonfina  in  central-southern  Italy.  Although  the  choice  of  this  area  was  mainly 

suggested  by  the  criterion  of  maintaining  the  geometry  of  the  network,  the  field  survey 

allowed  us  the  selection  of  a  site  with  considerable  thickness  of  competent  rocks  by  the 

central latite dome. 

Moraines  are  heterogeneous  glacial  deposits  that  usually  appear  chaotic,  colluviated  and 

weakly cemented; these poor geotechical characteristics  make  moraines  not  very  suitable  to 

host seismic stations. At the site ORO (Oropa in the north-western Alps, see Figure 9, station 

deployed  before  1992),  <15  ka,  30-40  m-thick  Wurm  moraines  are  deeply  eroded  by  the 

adjacent  stream  and  poorly  cemented.  In  this  case,  the  geological  field  survey  suggested 

moving  the  station  to  a  near  site  with  bedrock  directly  outcropping,  with  a  consequent 

improvement of the signal/noise ratio. 

The map and section in Figure 10 represent the geological setting at the PII-Pisa station in 

Central Italy. Here, the stratigraphy of a number of boreholes greatly helped to evaluate the 

thickness of the alluvial deposits in the area and to choose the most favourable site where to 

deploy the seismometer. The preferred site exhibits a low level of seismic noise, with a peak 

at  0.7  Hz  (Cimini  et  al.  1994)  possibly  due  to a site resonance induced by the nearby Arno 

River. 

 

10

From past data to future developments 

In  the  period  from  1  January  2000  to  31  December  2002  (hereinafter  2000-2002)  have 

been recorded 24458 events, 35% of which have been reliably located (the “gain”). Despite of 

nearly doubling the absolute number of reliably located events, the gain decreased from 44% 

(1985-1987) down to 35% (2000-2002). This change depend on the network only, being all 

the  parameters  used  in  the  location  procedure  the  same.  In  this  section,  we  investigate  the 

reasons  of  such  earthquake  losses,  suggesting  actions  to  improve  network  gains.  Such 

improvements do not seem out of reach – where not yet undertaken, as nine (≈10%) stations 

record more than 50% of not-localised earthquakes (see Table 1). 

Among  the  15437  poorly-located  events  and  sparse readings, we select the 15437 with a 

reliable  S-P  reading  at  the  closest  station.  The  distribution  of  S-P  delay  times  is  positively 

skewed, and the central 99% range is 0.73 s-12.34 s. The median of such distribution is 3.91 

s, with an estimated standard error of 2.43 s. For each station, we computed the median of the 

S-P delays relative to non-located earthquakes recorded at the station; then we converted such 

median  to  a  distance  by  multiplying  the  delay  by  6.4  km/s.  We  represent  for  each  station  a 

circle  whose  radius  is  the  median  distance  from  the  station  (Figure  11)  and  whose  colour 

represents the number of non-located events recorded at the station. We can easily identify the 

areas that might need actions to improve the network gain (although in some cases the action 

has  already  taken  at  the  time  of  writing).  From  Figure  11,  we  select  the  following  cases 

(South to North, counter clockwise):  

1) 

In Northwestern Sicily, the USI station (red colour in Figure 11) recorded more than 

1000  events  as  the  closest  station  (Table  1).  Such  large  number  derives  from  a 

sequence  occurred  40  km  offshore  NW  Sicily  in  the  second  half  of  2002. 

Improvements in this case could have come only from offshore seismometers.  

2) 

In, Eastern (Belice Valley) and Central Sicily, despite of the good station coverage, a 

significant  number  of  earthquakes  were  missed  around  the  CLTB  (cyan)  and  GIB 

 

11

(green) stations. The low number of S-readings at CLTB might be a starting point for 

investigating ways to improve station quality in this area. In Southern Calabria, SOI 

(cyan) seems to indicate a similar problem. 

3) 

In Southeastern Sicily, the existence of only three stations apparently makes several 

earthquakes to get lost. Therefore, an additional station close to PZI and MEU (cyan) 

might be enough to add details to the local seismicity. 

4) 

In Southern Apennines, we find cyan and green stations along the Tyrrhenian coast 

(MRLC,  SGO,  MGR,  SLCN,  and  CSSN),  indicating  low  efficiency,  and  several 

sparse blue stations along the Ionian coast, indicating the presence of local seismicity 

hard  to  detail.  The  former  problem  might  be  due  to  high  attenuation  in  the 

Tyrrhenian side, whereas the latter to the scarce network coverage. Recently (2003), 

the station density increased in the area, possibly overcoming the latter problem. 

5) 

In  the  Central  Apennines,  stations  CPI2  (yellow),  SDI,  RNI2,  RVI2  (green),  and 

PTQR (cyan) indicate low network efficiency in a region with high station density. 

More  to  the  North,  the  high  number  of  non-located  earthquakes  at  MNS  (yellow), 

SNTG, ASS, and NRCA (red) indicate low station coverage. In this area, the station 

density recently increased. 

6) 

In  Northern  Apennines,  the  great  number  of  missed  earthquakes  at  CSNT  (cyan), 

CRE, SFI, and PGD (red) indicate a poor network density/geometry, especially at the 

West  of  the  chain.  Increasing  the  density  in  that  location  might  solve,  at  the  same 

time, the geometry problems evidenced by stations BDI, GSCL, ZCCA (cyan). 

7) 

In  the  Alps,  especially  around  ORO  station  (blue),  there  is  a  certain  amount  of 

diffuse seismicity that might easily detailed by increasing the station density. ORO 

shows  how  a  good  quality  station  allows  recordings  with  S-P  reliable  readings  at 

significant distances (median distance ∼65 km).

Conclusions 

We analysed performances of Italian seismic network in 1985-2002, i.e., we defined basic 

significant  parameters  whose  evolution  in  time  might  indicate  quality  of  the  earthquake 

locations.  Then  we  verified  the  gain  of  the  network,  defined  as  the  percentage  of  located 

earthquakes with respect to the recorded earthquakes, and suggested possible actions to take 

in order to increase the gain.  

Completeness magnitude can be as low as 2.2 when we consider non-located earthquakes, 

whereas  the  completeness  for  located  earthquakes  is  2.4  in  the  average,  over  the  analysed 

period. When the location reliability is not the prime concern, the non-located earthquakes can 

be used in specific studies, for example to analyse dependence of the b-value on time. 

The  distance  between  an  earthquake  and  the  closest  station  decreases  ∼6  km  (∼20%)  or 

even  ∼15  km  in  specific  areas.  Such  variation  are  real,  i.e.  they  are  measured  over  real 

earthquakes in real operating conditions, and not speculative. Therefore, this numbers do not 

account for density improvement brought forth in areas after a seismic sequence.  

RMS  of  the  location  decreases  regularly  with time, for both lower and higher magnitude 

events, from 0.5 s to 0.4 s, and from 0.7 s to 0.6 s respectively (Figure 5). This values do not 

account  for  improvements  in  the  velocity  model  obtained  during  the  year,  as  we  made 

calculations  by  using  only  one  model.  Therefore,  the  RMS  reduction  only  reflects  network 

changes.  

Methods  for  geologic  and  seismological  characterisation  of  a  possible  station  site  also 

proved  to  be  effective.  We  relate  the  good  performances  of  ORO  station  to  the  good  site 

quality achieved after a joint geological and seismological survey.  

Finally, we represented the number of missed earthquakes at each station. We showed that 

nine  stations  control  more  that  50%  of  all  missed  earthquakes,  and  suggested  areas  in  Italy 

where the network might be easily improved. The low gain is apparently due to insufficient 

coverage in some cases and to station or site quality in others.

Figure 1. The Italian Telemetered Seismic Network at the beginning of year 1985 (black 

triangles) and at the end of year 2002 (black and white triangles).  

Figure  2.  Monthly  averages  (dots)  of  minimum  hypocentral  distance  and  associated 

standard deviation (bars) from year 1985 to August 2002. Only events with minimum distance 

less than 50 km contributed to the average. The line represents the linear fit of the minimum 

distance versus time.  

Figure  3.  Monthly  averages  (continuous  lines)  of  minimum  hypocentral  distance  like  in 

Figure 2, but relative to (a) Northern Apennines (blue), (b) Central Apennines (red), and (c) 

Matese-Irpinia in Southern Apennines (green). The dashed lines represent the linear fit of the 

minimum distance versus time. 

Figure  4.  Monthly  averages  (dots)  of  maximum  hypocentral  distance  and  associated 

standard  deviation  (bars)  from  year  1985  to  August  2002.  Only  events  with  maximum 

distance less than 600 km contributed to the average. The line represents the linear fit of the 

maximum distance versus time. 

Figure  5.  Monthly  averages  (dots)  of  RMS  travel  time  residuals  and  associated  standard 

deviation  (bars).  The  lines  represent  the  linear  fit  of  the  RMS  versus  time.  Open  dots  and 

dashed line are relative to Magnitude M>=3.3 events, whereas closed dots and continuous line 

are relative to all events. 

Figure 6. Average of location RMS and its associated standard deviation versus the number 

of P- (dots) and S-wave (crosses) arrival time data actually used in the location. The “sweet 

spot” for RMS is with a number of P readings comprised between 15 and 40, and a number of 

S readings of 4. To avoid overlapping bars, the standard deviation bars versus the number of S 

readings  have  been  moved  to  the  right  side  of  the  figure,  whereas  at  the  left  side  only  the 

average values (crosses) are plotted.

Figure  11.  Average  S-P  distance  and  number  of  non-located  earthquakes,  with  the 

histogram of the no. of stations in bins of 100 events. The circle radius is proportional to the 

S-P time (50 km radius for 10 s), whereas the colour (blue, cyan, green, yellow, red) depends 

on  the  number  of  data  at  each  station.  Circles  with  more  events  lie  higher.  The  histogram 

adopts the same colour scheme of circles, but the vertical scale is cropped at 20 stations for 

number of events less than 100.

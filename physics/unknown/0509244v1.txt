Abstract 

       In  a  recent  paper  Özdoğan  (Z.  Naturforsch,  59a(2004)743)  published  formulas  for 

evaluating the two-center overlap and nuclear attraction integrals over integer and noninteger 

n

 Slater type orbitals. The purpose of this article is to point out that the same formulas have 

previously been established by Guseinov et al. (J.Mol.Model.,8(2002)272) by using the same 

method.  As  we  demonstrated  in  our  Comment  (Int.J.Quantum  Chem.,  91(2003)62),  the 

expansion  formula  for  the  product  of  two  normalized  associated  Legendre  functions  in 

elliptical  coordinates  and  the  expansion  coefficients 

presented  by  Özdoğan  are  obtained

from  the  use  of  given  in  our  papers  general  formulas  (I.I.Guseinov,  J.Phys.,B,3(1970)1399; 

Phys.Rev.,A,32(1985)1864;  J.Mol.Struct 

(Theochem),336(1995)17)  by  changing 

the 

summation indices. It should be noted that the published by Özdoğan results are on the use of 

formulas for the evaluation of multicenter integrals presented in his other papers, which are 

also obtained from the  literature  (see,  e.g.,  C.C.J.  Roothaan,  J.Chem.Phys.,  19  (1951)  1445; 

A.Lofthus, Mol. Phys., 5 (1962) 105) and our articles by changing the summation indices (see

I. Introduction 

     Özdoğan  in  Ref.[1]  published  the  formulas  for  the  calculation  of  two-center  overlap 

integrals  and  nuclear  attraction  integrals  of  types 

a

/1(

a )
br

  and 

a

/1(

b )
br

.  It  is  well 

known  that  these  types  of  two-center  nuclear  attraction  integrals  can  be  expressed  by  two-

center  overlap  integrals  [2].  In  this  Comment  we  demonstrate  that  the  results  published  by 

Özdoğan in two-center nuclear attraction integrals are derived from the formulas for overlap 

integrals.  The  presented  in  Ref[1]  formulas  for the two-center overlap integrals also are not 

original  and  can  easily  be  obtained  from  the  formulas  published  in  our  papers  [3-6]  by 

changing  the  summation  indices.  As  we  have  shown  in  Comments  [7-12],  all  of  the  works 

published  by  Özdoğan  et  al.  [13-19]  on  the  calculation  of  multicenter  integrals  are  also 

obtained from the formulas of our articles. 

2. Theory 

     It is well known that the two-center nuclear attraction integrals over integer and noninteger

Thus, we have only two kinds of independent two-center nuclear attraction integrals, namely, 

U   and  one  of   

)

( AU

  and 

)

( BU

  -  integrals  which  are  reduced  to  the  two-center  overlap 

integrals. In Ref.[1], the U -type nuclear attraction integrals is not discussed and, therefore, it 

is  necessary  to  point  out  that  the  published  by  Özdoğan  paper  sheds  no  new  light  on  the 

subject and that it is altogether misleading. 

    Now  we  can  move  on  to  the  discussion  of  formulas  occurring  in  Sections  3  and  4  of 

Ref.[1]. Özdoğan claims that, he has presented recently in Refs.[13, 15] (see Refs.[12, 13] in 

[1]) the following formula for the product of two normalized associated Legendre functions:

by  changing  the  summation  indices.  We  note  that  the  generalized  binomial  coefficients 

( NNFm

,

)

 that occur in Eqs.(14)-(17) of Ref.[1] were introduced in our articles [3, 5]. 

    Using  above  mentioned  Eqs.(7)  and  (8)  it  is  easy  to  show  that  the  nuclear  attraction 

integrals

and

occurring in Eq.(18) of Ref.[1] are reduced to 

the overlap integrals 

I

(

, therefore, Eq.(18) is not the unified formula for two-

center one-electron molecular integrals. In Comments [8, 9] we demonstrated that the Eq.(18) 

of Ref.[1] is also obtained from our formulas by changing the summation indices. It should be 

noted that Eqs.(19)-(22) of Ref.[1] can also be found in our papers [3-6]. 

    Thus,  the  formulas  presented  in  Ref.[1]  by  Özdoğan  for  expansion  of  the  product  of  two 

normalized  associated  Legendre  functions  in  elliptical  coordinates  and  two-center  overlap 

integrals are not original and they can easily be derived from the analytical relations given in 

our papers by changing the summation indices (see Refs. [3-6, 8,9]). It should be noted that 

the  symbolic  results  of  two-center  overlap  integrals  between  different  combinations  of 

quantum  numbers  given  in  Tables  1  and  2  occurring  in  published  by  Gümüş  and  Özdoğan 

paper [19] can also be obtained from the use of established in above mentioned our papers [3-

5] general formulas or presented in the literature relations for overlap integrals in terms of the 

products of molecular auxiliary functions An (p) and Bn (pt) (see, e.g.,Ref. [20]).

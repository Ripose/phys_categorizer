ABSTRACT 
Based  on  the  proposed  unifying  theory  of  dark  matter  and 
quintessence,  a  novel  nonlinear  structure  formation  scenario  is 
suggested. This top-down singular and turbulent scenario results in 
a  bottom-up  hierarchical  clustering  and  is  consistent  with  various 
challenging cosmological observations like the existence of massive 
galaxies  and  galaxy  clusters  at  very  large  redshifts  (z  ≥  5).  Strong 
non-linearity  is  formed  in  the  very  early  stage,  therefore  no  extra 
biasing process is needed.

1   Introduction 
 
  In  the  mean  time,  despite  rapid  advancement  in  theoretical  cosmology 
development,  there  are  certain  issues  that  remain  unexplainable  in  the 
presently  available  theories;  one  of  these  issues  concern  the  origin  and 
nature  of  gravitational  instability  (Coles  2002;  Gibson  1999).  Recent 
studies that have incorporated condensation and void formation occurring 

1

 

on  the  non-acoustic  density  nuclei  produced by turbulent mixing appear 
to indicate that the universe is inherently nonlinear nature. 
 
 
1.1   Observations to be explained 
 
  The  epoch  zd  ≈  1000  is  the  order  of  magnitude  of  the  epoch  of 
decoupling. Since the radiation was in equilibrium with the plasma at Td, 
the  uniformity  of  the  cosmic  microwave  background  (CMB)  radiation 
implies that the gas of Hydrogen was also almost perfectly uniform at that 
time.  In  contrast,  the  observed  structure  of  luminous  matter  is  strongly 
clustered,  intermittent,  and  fractal-like,  with  correlations  over  perhaps 
hundreds of millions of light years.  
  In  the  last  two  decades  there  have  been  a  number  of  observations 
affecting  galaxy  formation  and  large-scale  structure  that  have  been  a 
potential  problem  for  traditional  models  which  invoked  early  random 
Gaussian  fluctuations.  In  particular,  many  of  the  advocates  of  gaussian 
fluctuations  and  cold  dark  matter  have  tried  to  argue  that  these 
observations  are  statistical  flukes  that  have  yet  to  be  established. 
Obviously,  if  these  potential  observations  continue  to  hold  up  and  are 
verified and are shown to be ubiquitous rather than statistical rarities, then 
the traditional models are in serious trouble. Perhaps the most potentially 
damning would be observations of microwave anisotropies ∆T/T at levels 
significantly  below  10-5.  However,  at  the  present  time,  observations  of 
small  scale  anisotropy  are  at  the  level  of  a  couple  times  10-5. 
Observations on angular scales of degrees or more are also approaching a 
few 10-5. 
  Also not explained are the carefully reasoned conclusions of Einasto et 
al.  (1997):  ‘‘we  present  evidence  for  a  quasi-regular  three  dimensional 
network  of  superclusters  and  voids,  with  the  regions  of  high  density 
separated  by  120  Mpc.  If  this  describes  the  distribution  of  all  matter 
(luminous  and  dark),  then  there  must  exist  some  hitherto  unknown 
process  that  produces  regular  structure  on  large  scales.’’  Therefore  the 
next observation that can be a potential problem for traditional models is 
the existence of structures with scales greater than the order of 100 Mpc, 
like the great wall observed by (Geller & Huchra 1989). The observations 
of (Broadhurst et al. 1990) show evidence for a multiplicity of such great 
walls with the characteristic spacing comparable to the size of the Geller-
Huchra  wall  itself.  While  much  debate has been made about whether or 
not the multiple walls of Broadhurst et al. are periodic or quasi-periodic, 
it  does  seem  clear  from  their  observations,  as  well  as  the  work  reported 
by  Szalay  (1990),  that  there  is  significant  structure  in  the  Universe  on 
scales  of  ~100  Mpc.  This  is  thoroughly  supported  by  the  large  coherent 

2

 

velocity flows where the Seven Samurai and others have found evidence 
for  the  existence  of  an  object  they  call  the  “Great  Attractor”  towards 
which  the  Virgo  cluster  and  the  Hydro-Centaurus  cluster  all  seem  to  be 
flowing  with  a  velocity  ~  600  km/sec.  This  again  seems  to  indicate 
evidence of structures on the scales of at least 60 Mpc.  
  Perhaps most constraining of the traditional astronomical measurements 
is  the  existence  of  objects  at  very  large  redshifts.  In  particular,  the 
surprising  observations  of  Subaru  telescope  of  the  presence  of  galaxy 
clusters  around  z  ~  6  (Ouchi  et  al.  2005)  and  a  massive  post-starburst 
galaxy at z ~ 6.5 observed by Mobasher et al. (2005). Schneider, Schmidt 
&  Gunn  (1989)  have  found  a  quasar  with  a  redshift  of  4.73  and  the 
current  record  holder  has  z  =  6.28.  Phinney  (CalTech)  was  reported  in 
Sky  &  Telescope  to  be  concerned  that  with  CDM  one  would  not  have 
time  enough  to  form  huge  109  solar  mass  quasars  in  only  one  billion 
years,  as  observed.  Now,  from  Sloan,  there  are  more  huge  quasars, 
including one at an age of only 700 Million years. As Efstathiou and Rees 
(1988)  have  noted,  if  such  objects  are  ubiquitous,  this  would  be  serious 
for primordial gaussian fluctuation models. 
  Another potentially serious observation for gaussian fluctuation models 
comes  from  the  work  of  Bahcall  &  Soneira  (1983),  and  Klypin  & 
Khlopov (1983) where they find that clusters of galaxies seem to be more 
strongly correlated with each other than galaxies are correlated with each 
other.  While  Primack  &  Dekel  (1990)  have  warned  of  the  dangers  of 
projection  effects  on  such  observations,  it  seems  difficult  to  understand 
how  projection  effects  would  give  the  fractal-like  behavior  (Szalay  & 
Schramm  1985).  Furthermore,  the  southern  hemisphere  work  of  Huchra 
also  seems  to  support  high  cluster  correlations.  Van  den  Bergh  &  West 
(1991) have also found similar correlations for the CD galaxies observed 
at  cluster  centers.  The  CD’s  should  not  have  the  projection  effect 
problems  because  redshifts  are  known.  Even  Primack  &  Dekel  now 
acknowledge that there seems to be some excess in cluster correlations. If 
such  large  correlations  turn  out  to  be  real,  they  too  cannot  be  easily 
explained in the gaussian model, and, as Szalay & Schramm (1985) note, 
they seem to be best fit by some sort of fractal-like pattern. 
 
 
1.2   Late-Time cosmological Phase Transitions (LTPT)  
 
  As  proposed  by  many  researchers  (Wasserman  1986;  Schramm  1990; 
Press, Ryden & Spergel 1990; Gradwohl 1991; Frieman, Hill & Watkins 
1992; Sin 1994; Sandvik, Barrow & Magueijo 2002; Nishiyama, Morita 
&  Morikawa  2004;  etc.),  Late-Time  cosmological  Phase  Transitions 
(LTPTs) could be beneficial if the model assembled galaxies earlier than 

3

 

predicted  in  the  cold  dark  matter  model,  and  earlier  formation  better  fit 
the observations. The bottom line of the theory is that if phase transitions 
happen  after  decoupling,  one  can  avoid  the  constraint  imposed  by 
isotropy of microwave background.    
  By  LTPT  we  will  mean  any  non-linear  growth  occurring  shortly  after 
recombination.  It  is  also  possible  that  some  normal  random  gaussian 
pattern  from  the  very  early  universe  could  be  triggered  to  undergo  non-
linear  growth  by  some  sort  of  phase  transitions  or  related  phenomenon 
occurring  after  recombination  (Schramm  1990).  In  general  we  will  see 
that  these  late-time  transitions  can  give  the  smallest  possible  ∆T/T  for  a 
given  size  structure.  They  can  produce  non-gaussian  structural  patterns, 
fractal-like with large velocity flows.  
 
  As  mentioned  above,  the  very  dramatic  advantage  of  late-time 
transitions is that it can produce structure with δρ/ρ ≥ 1 at z ≥ 10. Thus, 
one could have significant structure and a significant number of objects at 
high  redshift,  which  is  a  problem  in  any  normal  model  with  the  seeds 
forming prior to recombination. Baryonic dark matter runs into problems 
since  it  cannot  get  the  structure  we  now  observe  formed  without 
generating too much anisotropy in the CMB radiation. LTPTs can serve 
as the seeds needed to generate large scale structure after decoupling, so 
there  is  no  need  to  the  decoupling  of  dark  matter  earlier  than 
recombination from ordinary baryonic matter. 
 
 
   In this paper, based on the proposed unifying theory of dark matter and 
quintessence  I  intend  to  reconstruct  the  jigsaw  puzzle  of  structure 
formation  in  the  universe.  In  this  immense  puzzle,  some  fragments  are 
not  discovered  yet  but  the  frame  of  the  scenario  is  proposed.  In  the 
subsequent papers several aspects of the scenario are discussed. In section 
2  the  outline  of  a  new  scenario  of  large-scale  structure  formation  was 
propounded. In the final section the consequences and novel predictions 
of the new theory are considered. 
 
 
2   Singular-turbulent structure formation in the dark ages 

 

2.1 Dark or bright matter? 
 
  After  an  inflationary  epoch,  the  vacuum  energy  transforms  itself  to 
radiation  energy  and  flows  into  the  form  of  more  familiar  particles, 
photons:  ‘the  Creation  of  light’.  The  boson  dark  matter  as  a  fluid  is 
produced as early as this time. Surprisingly, the boson dark matter which 

4

 

is  actually 

dominates  the  energy  density  of  the  universe  is  the  light  itself.  The 
background  radiation  energy  (CMB)  originates  here  and  therefore  the 
dark  matter  is  not  dark  at  all!  The  boson  dark  matter  reaches  the 
superfluid transition temperature Tc, below which an electromagnetically 
induced ‘‘gravity’’ appears in the universe and the gravity gradually starts 
to work. The earliest feasible time for the transition of boson dark matter 
to  superfluidity  or  BEC  state  is  after  inflation  and  reheating  stage 
(Mangano  et  al.  2001).  The  temperature  dependence  of  the  Newton 
constant  pretends  to  be  more  universal,  since  it  does  not  depend  on  the 
microscopic  parameters  of  the  system  (Volovik  2003).  Graviton  is  the 
superfluid  vacuum  (condensate)  of  superfluid  bosonic  dark  matter  or 
‘light’.    After  the  formation  of  quarks,  dense  quark  matter  at  low 
temperatures  is  expected  to  be  in  a  BCS-paired  superfluid  state  (Iida  & 
Baym  2002).  Therefore  the  essence  of  gluon  like  graviton  which  is  the 
superfluid  vacuum  of  superfluid  bosonic  dark  matter,  is  the  superfluid 
vacuum  of  superfluid  fermionic  quark  matter  and  the  coherent  and 
strongly  coupled  quark-gluon  plasma 
the  BCS-paired 
superfluid quark matter. Ordinary baryonic matter acts as the ‘impurities’ 
in the superfluid boson dark matter. 
  As  a  result,  after  a  phase 
transition  from  a  symmetry  state 
(homogeneous  fluid  including  matter  and  dark  matter)  to  a  broken-
symmetry  state  (universe  with  two  different  coexisting  phases  separated 
by  an  interface)  at  T  <  Tc,  the  superfluid  transition  temperature  of  the 
boson  dark  matter,  two  phases  [a  black  brew  of  primordial  gases 
‘‘matter’’ immersed in an ocean of ‘‘superfluid boson dark matter’’, we 
named it ‘‘liquid phase’’, and a vacuum like phase (an immiscible phase)] 
and  a  non-zero  interfacial  tension  appeared  in  the  system  (interfacial 
tension  have  a  determinant  role  in  the  evolution  of  universe).  The 
assumptions  of  incompressibility  [Compressibility  decreases  the  growth 
rate. This is an expected result, since the system has now more degrees of 
freedom  (e.g.,  now  the  perturbation  stores  thermal  energy  as  well)]  and 
vortical turbulent velocity are justified in the liquid phase.  
 
  Therefore, in my model, after the superfluid transition of the boson dark 
matter  and  establishment  of  gravity  in  the  universe,  we  treat  the  liquid 
phase as if it behaved like a strongly coupled, self-bound, incompressible, 
and non-expandable fluid [the liquid phase is treated as one single body 
fluid]  in  an  expanding  universe.  Then,  the  liquid  phase  can  no  longer 
respond  sufficiently  fast  to  the  expansion  and  the  expansion  tends  to  an 
expansion  into  a  vacuum.  We  thus  demand  that  matter  in  the  Universe 
exhibits  an  internal  attractive  interaction  that  simulates  connectivity  and 
viscosity;  that  there  is  a  tension  mediating  the  negative  hydrodynamic 
pressure from the Hubble expansion.  Therefore the liquid phase can not 

5

 

theory  after 

exist  in  a  state  of  negative  pressure  and  in  other  words,  hydrodynamic 
pressure  of  the  liquid  phase  would  become  negative  if  instablity  not 
proceeds (Bucher & Spergel 1999; Nørretranders, Bohr & Brunak 1993).   
  A perfect fluid with negative pressure is not possible because its sound 
speed  would  be  imaginary,  indicating  instabilities  on  a  short  timescale 
whose growth rate diverges as the wavelength approaches zero.  There is 
no elastic resistance to pure shear deformations (Bucher & Spergel 1999); 
therefore, the liquid phase vigorously churned by the counteraction of the 
gravity and universe expansion in the dark ages when T < Tc.  
 
  Because  of  the  phase  separation  by  superfluid  transition  of  the  boson 
dark matter, the fluctuations due to inflation will not influence mainly the 
process  of  structure  formation.  In  our  model,  cosmic  structure  is  not 
really a microscopic effect. 
 
 
2.2  LTPT:  Structure  formation  by  Newell-Zakharov 
decoupling and transition to superfluidity  
 
  (Silk  1973,  1974)  has  shown  that  the effects of expansion caused little 
deviation  in  turbulence  from  the  incompressible  case.  We  can  have  an 
incompressible turbulent medium in the liquid phase during the structure 
formation  at  T<Tc  and  as  a  consequence  of  large  Reynolds  number  and 
short  hydrodynamic 
if 
compressibility increase with time] should rapidly reach the Kolmogorov 
spectrum.   
 
  Situation of the structure formation in the universe by the counteraction 
of  gravity  and  universe  expansion  is  alike  to  the  excitation  of  surface 
waves  (Faraday  waves)  and  could  be  directly  verified  in  a  Faraday 
experiment.  When  the  excitation  of  free  surface  waves  exceeds  a  well 
defined threshold, the waves break and chaotic and turbulent bifurcations 
of Faraday surface waves lead to a low-dimensional aperiodic state with 
spikes,  droplet  ejection,  and  gas  entrainment  (Tao  Shi,  Goodridge  & 
Lathrop 1997).  
 
  Parametrically forced surface waves were first studied experimentally in 
1831 by Faraday. Since then, the onset of periodic surface waves and the 
existence  of  spatial  and  temporal  chaos  in  this  system  have  been 
extensively studied (Ciliberto & Gollub 1985; Simonelli & Gollub 1988; 
Meron  &  Procaccia  1986;  Meron  1987),  including  the  formation  of 
quasicrystals  and  other  wave  phenomena  (Tao  Shi,  Goodridge  &  Lathrop 
1997). Later theoretical and experimental observations have pointed to a

transition  leading  to  cusps  and  singularities  when  the  surface  changes 
topology  (Newell  &  Zakharov  1992).  Newell  &  Zakharov  (1992)  have 
proposed a nonlinear singular-turbulent theory for the excitation of waves 
by a shear flow. This theory is based on a weak-turbulence description of 
the  waves  using  kinetic  equations.  For  energy  fluxes  bigger  than  a 
threshold,  oscillations  are  excited  in  the  instability  region,  which  lies  in 
the  gravitational  part  of  the  spectrum.  The  growth  of  the  oscillations  is 
limited by cascade processes, as a result of which two Kolmogorov-type 
turbulent spectra are formed. One of them corresponds to a constant flux 
of  wave  action  or  of  the  number  of  waves  and  develops  in  the  long-
wavelength  region.  The  other  Kolmogorov  spectrum  corresponds  to  a 
constant energy flux directed to smaller scales:

P0 = (γg/ρ1)3/4 is a critical value of the energy flux per unit area P (for the 
resonant  states  that  (Boettcher,  Fineberg  &  Lathrop  2000)  used,  they 
found the threshold power for wave breaking to be much lower than that 
predicted by Newell & Zakharov. According to the Newell & Zakharov 
theory,  for  obtaining  the  critical  power  flux  per  unit  area  for  breaking 
waves to occur a broad driving spectrum was assumed).  
  If  during  the  formation  of  the  cosmic  foam,  the  density  of  the  liquid 
phase  was  constant  or  the  time  scale for structure formation by Newell-
Zakharov  theory,  τNZ,  is  smaller  than  the  characteristic  time  for  the 
decrease  in  density  of  the  liquid  phase  ( ρρ &/
)f,  then  the  relevant 
equations  in  the  liquid  phase  (like  cascade  processes  as  a  result  of  two 
Kolmogorov-type  turbulent  spectra  and  P0)  remains  unchanged  or 
unaffected by universe expansion. 
  Because of the decelerating nature of the universe expansion, the energy 
flux per unit area, P, is a decreasing function of time.

  For  values  P  <  P0  and  k  <  kcr,  the  energy  is  carried  to  high,  surface 
tension dominated wave numbers by E1(k), where the energy flux can be 
absorbed by surface tension wrinkling.  
  When  P  =  P0  will  the  equilibrium  spectrum  E2(k)  be  exactly  realized 
because only then is E1(kcr) = E2(kcr). 
  For P < P0 and k > kcr, E(k) > E2(k).  
   
  For this range of fluxes the interface of two phases stays smooth, energy 
is  transferred  to  scales  where  viscosity  is  important  by  wave-wave 
interactions and the topological boundary condition that a liquid particle 
on the surface stays there remains intact.

  It is interesting that the criterion that P > P0 is also the criterion for the 
Kolmogorov–Zakharov spectrum to meet the Phillip’s spectrum before k 
= kcr. P is too much for a smooth surface to handle. In order to absorb the 
energy flux, the surface must increase its area. But it cannot use a smooth 
surface on which surface tension waves redistribute the energy to smaller 
scales because kl < kcr . The only remaining way for the surface to achieve 
a greater area is for it to break and to spray droplets of liquid (matter & 
dark  matter)  into  the  phase  immediately  above  the  interface  causing  the 
formation of cosmic foam consisting of liquid droplets of a size at which 
surface  tension  effects  are  important.    Because  of  that  P0  is  a  constant 
value or an increasing function of time and P is a decreasing function of 
time, so if P > P0 early, soon or late, P becomes smaller than P0 and the 
cosmic foam formation is stopped. If P is strong enough (P > P0) early in 
the formation of cosmic foam (according to our theory, the liquid phase 
vigorously  churned  in  the  dark  ages),  then  because  of  the  short  τNZ 
(because of the collapsing singular nature of the process which leading to 
the  breakdown  of  the  interface)  and  long  characteristic  time  (in 
comparison  with  τNZ)  for  the  decrease  in  P  (
),  before  that  P 
becomes  smaller  than  P0,  a  fully  developed,  spatially  homogeneous 
cosmic foam can form, so we assume the cosmic foam to be distributed 
uniformly in the interface of two phases. In the course of the expansion of 
the  Universe  and  via  a  top-down  scenario,  the  large-scale  structure  is 
formed  by  the  present  epoch.  Earlier  interpretations  of  the  large  scale 
structure  as  Voronoi  foam  are  primarily  based  on  the  geometrical 
similarity; our model is rooted in a physical mechanism applicable to the 
cosmological  problem  and  resulting  morphology  is  consistent  with  the 
observed correlation functions, since a Voronoi tessellation in its original

assembled and collided on the interface of two phases and because of the 
dynamical  evolution  of  the  foam  a  cosmic  foam  where  the  voids  retain 
only approximate spherical formed as convex polyhedrons.   
 
  In  the  Newell-Zakharov  theory,  in  the  gravitational-capillary  transition 
region  the  spectrum  with  a  constant  energy  flux  must  be  joined  to  the 
Kolmogorov spectrum of the capillary waves.

  Wave collapse or breaking is the most effective mechanism of the wave-
energy  dissipation.  For  the  liquid  phase  surface  waves  the  analogous 
phenomenon leads to the infinite second derivative of the surface profile 
(so  that  angles  or  cones  appear  on  the  surface).  Checking  analyticity 
violation is the most sensitive tool for studying that set of collapses. Loss 
of  analyticity  of  vortex  sheets  at  the  nonlinear  stage  of  the  Kelvin-
Helmholtz  instability  is  such  an  example.  It  was  assumed  that  the 
singularity  formation  on  the  free  surface  of  the  ideal  fluid  or  in  a  more 
general  case,  for  the  boundary  between  two  ideal  fluids,  is  mainly 
connected  with  inertial  forces;  other  factors  give  minor  correction 
states 
(Kuznetsov,  Spector  &  Zakharov  1994).  Wave-breaking 
necessarily  contain  singularities,  since  they  exhibit  a  change  from  a 
simply  connected  free  surface  to  a  free  surface  connected  in  multiple 
ways with droplet ejection and entrainment of the other phase. Waves on 
the  open  fluid  that  break  can  also  show  several  types  of  singular 
phenomena. The spray and foam produced in liquid phase breaking also 
contain gravity-capillary singular phenomena associated with the change 
in  topology.  This  type  of  spray  production  also  occurs  in  rivers  and 
streams with significant surface and bulk turbulence. Therefore during the 
wave-breaking  process,  in  addition  to  the  explosion  of  liquid  phase 
(including  matter  and  dark-matter)  into  droplets,  one  can  also  have 
entrainment of the other phase into the liquid phase and the formation of 
a  cloud  of  other  phase  bubbles  (voids)  surrounded  by  a  connected  fluid 
region.  For  this  situation,  and  for  a  combination  of  other  immiscible 
phase bubbles (voids) in liquid phase and liquid phase bubbles (droplets) 
in immiscible phase, similar calculations would obtain.  
  In addition to the multiphase possibilities, our model must take account 
of the turbulence in the liquid phase itself. 
 
  A  harmonic  acceleration,  possibly  in  the  presence  of  a  constant  body 
force,  associated  with  Faraday  waves  (Wright,  Yon  &  Pozrikidis  2000). 
Droplet ejecting Faraday waves (surface wave singularities) are produced 
by  vertically  oscillating  a  fluid  surface  with  sufficient  acceleration.  The 
flat  surface  becomes  unstable  to  periodic  surface  waves  at  a  critical 
acceleration  (via  the  Faraday  instability).  As  the  excitation  is  increased 
further, we observe a sharp transition to a state with spikes on the surface 
which  eject  droplets  from  the  tip  (Goodridge,  Tao  Shi  &  Lathrop  1996; 
Tao Shi, Goodridge & Lathrop 1997; Saylor & Handler 1997; Hogrefe et 
al. 1998; Goodridge, Hentschel & Lathrop 1999).  
  As  mentioned  above,  the  ejection  is  preceded,  by  one  period;  by  a 
rounded  wave  peak  whose  amplitude  increases  until  the  slope  becomes 

10

 

infinite and a slight overhang is formed. This last smooth wave collapses 
into a sharp-cornered depression, which then focuses to form a growing 
spike.  The  spike  increases  in  amplitude  and  width  and  suffers  droplet 
producing  Rayleigh  instabilities  (which  cause  the  wave  tips  to  break 
under  the  influence  of  surface  tension  forces)  near  the  cylindrical  top. 
Finally, it collapses due to gravitational forces, leaving behind a stretched 
neck which also breaks into droplets. The collapsing spike often entrains 
bubbles into the fluid bulk (Goodridge, Tao Shi & Lathrop 1996). In low-
viscosity  liquids,  spikes  are  produced  which  immediately  break  up  into 
droplets. In high-viscosity fluids, these peaks maintain their structure and 
can produce long filaments before droplet breakoff occurs (Goodridge et 
al.  1997).  The  rate  of  breaking  events  approaches  zero  gradually  with 
decreasing  acceleration.  (Goodridge,  Hentschel  &  Lathrop  1999) 
experimentally  support  the  hypothesis  put  forward  by  (Newell  and 
Zakharov  1992)  that  a  continuous  transition  exists  from  unbroken 
surfaces to surfaces with droplets and spray.  
 
  Well-controlled  experiments  exhibiting  droplet  ejection  are  Faraday 
waves  forced  above  a  threshold  acceleration  (Goodridge,  Tao  Shi  & 
Lathrop 1996). The flux P can be easily controlled and the energy can be 
injected at whatever wave number k < k0 found to be suitable. Moreover, 
the  surface  tension  can  also  be  sensitively  controlled  so  that  a  fully 
developed  foam  is  formed  (Newell  &  Zakharov  1992).  Faraday  waves 
have been well studied and the ejection threshold has been characterized 
over a wide parametric range (Goodridge et al. 1997). Droplet ejection in 
Faraday  waves  is  a  random  and  uncorrelated  phenomenon.  Individual 
waves  eject  independently  of  other  waves  in  a  fashion  similar  to  a 
radioactive decay (Goodridge, Hentschel & Lathrop 1999). 
 
  Droplet ejection occurs in waves restored by gravitational forces (lower 
frequency  gravity  waves)  and  those  restored  by  surface  tension  forces 
(higher  frequency  capillary  waves).  It  is  notable  that  although  the 
excitation occurs in gravity length scales the fluid motion transfers energy 
to  capillary  length  scales  in  the  spike  (Goodridge,  Tao  Shi  &  Lathrop 
1996). 
 
  A  theory,  motivated  by  the  cylindrical  shape  of  the  pre-singularity 
surface depression in the Faraday experiment, predicted that the resulting 
shape of the singularity would grow according to the power law z = btr-
1/2. Investigation of the Faraday experiment resulted in a confirmation of 
the theory. Furthermore, information was derived about the velocity field 
of the fluid after the singularity occurred by comparing the experimental 
value for b to its predicted form (Hogrefe et al. 1998).

  Droplet  ejection  from  liquid  surfaces  is  a  ubiquitous  phenomenon  in 
nature.  Wave  breaking  on  the  surfaces  of  oceans  and  lakes,  the  spray 
from turbulent rivers, and the splash from a raindrop hitting a puddle all 
involve the production of small, energetic droplets which escape and then 
rejoin  the  main  body  of  the  liquid.  These  surface  waves  receive  the 
energy needed to create droplets from sources such as the shear flow or 
gravity driven flow and require a certain minimum energy flux to produce 
droplets  (Goodridge  et  al.  1997).  Viscous  dissipation  may  be  the 
dominant  sink  of  energy  for  very  short  waves,  but  breaking  affects  all 
part of the spectrum. It is probably the main cause of long gravity wave 
attenuation. Waves break when inertial accelerations exceed the restoring 
force,  or  when  particle  velocities  at  the  wave  crest  outstrip  the  phase 
velocity of the wave. Wave breaking manifests itself through whitecaps. 
Breaking serves to limiting height of surface waves, dissipating surface-
wave energy, some of which is available for turbulent mixing. Breaking 
is multi-scale process: from large-scale breaking waves and smaller-scale 
waves  breaking  on  longer  waves  to  micro-scale  breaking  (The  wave 
breaking  process  is  pictured  as  highly  nonlinear  in  wave  steepness, 
having no effect until some limiting steepness is reached when the wave 
becomes  unstable  and  spills  or  plunges  forward,  producing  whitecaps  at 
large scales or a micro breaker at small scales. At the end of the breaking 
event  a  substantial  energy  loss  may  occur).  Direct  measurements  show 
that  breaking  generates  spectra  of  the  intensive  outbursts  of  turbulence 
with  dissipation  rate  that  is  orders  of  magnitude  larger  than  the  mean 
lognormal  probability 
in 
value.  These  events  result 
distribution of the dissipation rate.

  Owing  to  the  surface  tension,  the  jet  of  the  immiscible  phase 
disintegrates into bubbles, the bubbles are broken to a certain limit, and 
the bubbles of sufficiently small diameter d are preserved, since for small 
d  the  breaking  forces  acting  on  them  due  to  the  velocity  differences, 
which  are  of  the  order  of  υd,  are  small  for  small  d  and  can  no  longer 
overcome the surface tension; or When the turbulent stresses are equal to 
the confining stresses, τt(d) = τs(d), a critical diameter, dc, is defined such 
that  particles  with  d  <  dc  are  stable  and  will  never  break  (Kolmogorov 
1949; Hinze 1955). A particle of size d > dc has a surface energy smaller 

12

 

than the deformation energy (τt(d) > τs(d)), and thus, the particle deforms 
and eventually breaks up.

Origin of lognormal droplet/void size distribution 
 
  In  the  past  decade,  if  many  papers  deal  with  the  3D  distribution  of 
galaxies  very  few  explore  how  the  voids  are  distributed.  Only  recently, 
the  void  size  distribution  as  an  indicator  of  the  dynamics  of  void 
formation  is  considered.  If  the  resemblance  of  large  scale  structure  to  a 
cosmic  foam  be  further  than  a  geometrical  analogy,  then  as  in 
hydrodynamic  foams,  the  distribution  of  void  size  is  a  function  of  the 
method of foam production (Weaire & Hutzler 1999). With a great degree 
of  accuracy,  the  PDF  of  void  size  in  different  large  surveys  like  LCRS 
(Müller  et  al.  2000)  and  2dFGRS  (Figure  1)  is  lognormal.  This 
distribution is considered for the first time by Zaninetti (1991) in order to 
simulate  the  CFA  data.  As  proposed  by  (Kolmogorov  1941,  1949),  a 
foam with a lognormal PDF is produced in a turbulent medium in which 
bubbles  (voids)  are  repeatedly  fragmented.  Therefore  the  observed  size 
distribution of voids in redshift surveys as in ancient cosmogonies further 
support  the  turbulent  nature  of  structure  formation  in  the  universe!    We 
can  interpret  the  observed  log-normal  void  size  distribution  as  a 
consequence of a mixing process, in which turbulent mixing at a material 
interface  between  two  phases  is  essential  to  the  evolution  of  the  large-
scale structure.

  According to the (Brovchenko & Maderich 2004), almost all statistical 
models of break-up of an immiscible fluid immersed into a turbulent flow 
were  not  able  to  reproduce  observed  distribution  of  oil  droplet  size 
entrained  by  breaking  waves  in  stormy  conditions.  Instead,  the  new 
model  of  the  breakup  based  on  (Kolmogorov  1941)  approach  was 
proposed  to  reproduce  observed  lognormal  distribution  of  oil  droplet 
sizes. The theory of break-up of bubbles immersed into a turbulent flow 
in principle is no different from that of drops. The only actual difference 
is  the  fact  that  the  critical  size  of  the  bubble  at  which  break-up  occurs 
differs  from  that  of  drops,  so  we  can  use  (Brovchenko  &  Maderich 
2004)’s results in the case of the breakup of entrained immiscible phase 
in the surface layer of the liquid phase.  
 
  For a given P, the droplets/bubbles will continue to break up by surface 
deformation  and  form  even  smaller  droplets/bubbles  until  they  reach  a 
size λ where all the energy flux can be absorbed. At this stage, the cosmic 
foam  will  cease  to  grow  and  the  liquid  droplets  will  simply  oscillate.  If

viscosity  is  present,  we  can  form  the  Kolmogorov  length  scale  (internal 
scale)

so l is an increasing function of time. 
However, the ratio 
g

λ
becomes  smaller  as  P  increases,  so  that  even  though  the  bubble  size 
decreases,  the  Kolmogorov  length  scale,  at  which  viscous  effects  would 
be expected to become important, decreases at a slightly faster rate. Thus 
the  mechanism  for  dissipation  of  the  cosmic  foam  must  involve  more 
complicated  dynamical  processes  such  as  a  weak  turbulence  energy 
transfer by small amplitude waves on the bubble surfaces. 
   
 
Late Time Phase Transition 
 
  In the case of cosmic foam formation, late time phase transition causes a 
change of topology. Order parameter - in the model - is the deviation of 
the  liquid  phase  surface  (including  matter  and  dark-matter)  from  the 
smoothness  and  connectivity  it  has  at  P  <  P0,  the  critical  value  of  the 
energy  flux  per  unit  area.  At  P  >  P0  the  smooth  surface  condition  is 
broken  and  cusps  and  singularities  (droplets,  spray,  and  foam,  produced 
by breaking deep fluid waves are examples of dynamical singularities on 
the  free  surface  of  a  fluid)  are  formed.  The  symmetry  breaking  is 
spontaneous. A phase transition from a symmetry state (unbroken surface 
or  turbulent  nonejecting  state)  to  a  broken-symmetry  state  (surface  with 
droplets and spray or turbulent ejecting state) was causing the formation 
of  an  [liquid  phase  (matter  &  dark  matter)  ―  other  immiscible  phase] 
foam. 
  Under hurricane-like conditions in the beginning of the dark ages which 
lead to uniform distribution of cosmic foam, with considering the effect 
of  long  waves  (as  a  “geometric  imperfection”)  which  makes  the  phase 
transition  continuous  (Newell  &  Zakharov  1992),  we  suggest  that  the 
behavior  near  P  =  P0  is  equivalent  to  a  second  order  phase  transition 
(Newell & Zakharov 1992; Goodridge, Hentschel & Lathrop 1999); thus 
geometric imperfections have a determinant role in resolving the order of 
phase transition. The phase transition is influenced by several factors: (1) 
the kinematic surface tension γ /ρ, (2) the kinematic viscosity of the fluid 
ν  =μ  /ρ,  and  (3)  the  applied  forcing  frequency  ω0.  Low-viscosity  fluids 

15

 

have  threshold  accelerations  which  depend  on  only  surface  tension  and 
forcing frequency. 
 
 
Turbulence in superfluids 
  
  Turbulence in superfluids is governed by two dimensionless parameters. 
One  of  them  is  the  intrinsic  parameter  q  =  α/(1  −  α′)(dimensionless 
parameters α′ and α come from the reactive and dissipative forces acting 
on a vortex when it moves with respect to the normal component) which 
characterizes the friction forces acting on a vortex moving with respect to 
the  normal  component,  with  q−1  playing  the  same  role  as  the  Reynolds 
number Re = UR/ν in classical hydrodynamics. The developed turbulence 
described  by  Kolmogorov  cascade  occurs  when  Re  >>  1  in  classical 
hydrodynamics,  and  q  <<  1  in  the  superfluid  hydrodynamics.  Another 
parameter of the superfluid turbulence is the superfluid Reynolds number 
Res  =  UR/κ,  which  contains  the  circulation  quantum  κ  characterizing 
quantized  vorticity  in  superfluids.  This  parameter  may  regulate  the 
crossover  or  transition  between  two  classes  of  superfluid  turbulence:  (i) 
the  classical  regime  of  Kolmogorov  cascade  where  vortices  are  locally 
polarized  and  the  quantization  of  vorticity  is  not  important;  and  (ii)  the 
quantum  Vinen  turbulence  whose  properties  are  determined  by  the 
quantization  of  vorticity.  The  phase  diagram  of  the  dynamical  vortex 
states is suggested (Volovik 2003). 
  The turbulence in the superfluid component with the normal component 
at  rest  is  referred  to  as  the  superfluid  turbulence  (Volovik  2003).  The 
important feature of the superfluid turbulence is that the vorticity of the 
superfluid component is quantized in terms of the elementary circulation 
quantum  κ.  So  the  superfluid  turbulence  is  the  chaotic  motion  of  well 
determined  and  well 
further 
separated  vortex 
simplification  comes  from  the  fact  that  the  dissipation  of  the  vortex 
motion  is  not  due  to  the  viscosity  term  in  the  Navier-Stokes  equation 
v2∇ in classical liquid, but 
which is proportional to the velocity gradients 
due to the friction force acting on the vortex when it moves with respect 
to  the  normal  component.  This  force  is  proportional  to  velocity  of  the 
v2∇ term  are 
vortex,  and  thus  the  complications  resulting  from  the 
avoided. 
vr = (ε r)1/3                                                                                               (12) 
  This  must  be  valid  both  in  classical  and  superfluid  liquids.  What  is 
different is the parameter ε: it is determined by the dissipation mechanism 
which is different in two liquids.

As distinct from the classical liquid where k0 is determined by viscosity, 
in the superfluid turbulence the cut-off k0 is determined by mutual friction 
parameter q: k0 = 1/r0 = R−1q−3/2. 
 
 At a very small q the quantization of circulation becomes important. The 
condition of the above consideration is that the relevant circulation can be 
considered as continuous, i.e. the circulation at the scale r0 is larger than 
the circulation quantum: vr0r0 > κ. This gives 
vr0r0 = q2UR = q2κRes > κ, Res = UR/κ                                                  (17) 
i.e. the constraint for the application of the Kolmogorov cascade is 
Res > 1/q2 >> 1                                                                                       (18) 
  So,  the  crossover  between  the  classical  and  quantum  regimes  of  the 
turbulent  states  occurs  at  Resq2  =  1  and  the  Vinen  state  which  probably 
occurs when Resq2 < 1. 
  The  transition  (or  maybe  crossover)  is  suggested  here  between  the 
quantum  and  classical  regimes  of  the  developed  superfluid  turbulence, 
though there are arguments that the classical regime can never be reached 
because  the  vortex  stretching  is  missing  in  the  superfluid  turbulence 
(Kivotides  &  Leonard  2003);  although,  (Kivotides  et  al.  2002)  study 
numerically statistics of superfluid turbulence. They generate a quantized 
superfluid  vortex  tangle  driven  by  a  realistic  model  of  normal-fluid 
turbulence whose energy spectrum obeys Kolmogorov classical k-5/3 law, 
where  k  is  the  wave  number.  They  find  that  the  resulting  superfluid 
velocity spectrum has approximately a k-1-dependence for wave numbers 
of the order of 1/δ and larger, where δ is the average intervortex spacing. 
This result is similar to what happens in a pure superflow (Araki, Tsubota 
& Nemirovskii 2002). (Kivotides et al. 2002) also find that the spectrum 
of  the  total  velocity  field  follows  the  classical  k-5/3  law,  even  at 
temperatures  low  enough  that  the  normal-fluid  mass  is  only  5%  of  the 
total helium mass.

  Tsubota  &  Kobayashi  (2005)  introduce  an  energy  injection  at  large 
scales  as  well  as  the  small-scale  dissipation,  and  obtain  the  statistically 
steady  turbulence  made  by  the  balance  of  the  injection  and  the 
dissipation. The inertial range still takes the Kolmogorov spectrum for the 
incompressible  kinetic  energy.  The  energy  flux,  which  transfers  the 
energy  from  large  to  small  scales,  is  almost  constant  in  time  and 
independent  of  the  wave  number,  being  consistent  with  the  energy 
dissipation  rate  at  small  scale.  These  discoveries  show  surprising 
properties of the inertial range of QT which have ever been unclear. The 
inertial range of QT is also sustained by the Richardson cascade process 
of quantized vortices. Kobayashi & Tsubota (2005), in their experiments, 
show a similarity between ST and CT. This can be understood using the 
idea  that  the  superfluid  and  the  normal  fluid  are  likely  to  be  coupled 
together  by  the  mutual  friction  between  them  and  thus  to  behave  like  a 
conventional  fluid.  Since  the  normal  fluid  is  negligible  at  very  low 
temperatures, an important question arises: even without the normal fluid, 
is ST still similar to CT or not? Quantum turbulence (QT) consisting of 
quantized  vortices  can  propose  a  prototype  of  turbulence  much  simpler 
than classical turbulence. One of the points is how QT can reproduce the 
essence  of  classical  turbulence.  Recently  they  made  the  numerical 
analysis  of  the  Gross-Pitaevskii  equation  with  a  dissipation  term  that 
works only in the scale smaller than the healing length, thus succeeding 
in  obtaining  clearly  the  Kolmogorov  spectrum which is one of the most 
important statistical laws in turbulence. 
 
  The turbulence in classical liquids is thought to be characterized by the 
dynamics of the vortex tubes, whose radii are of order of the dissipative 
Kolmogorov scale. In some regime, the superfluid turbulence is similar to 
that  in  classical  liquids  with  modified  dissipation.  Thus  the  quantum 
liquid  serves  as  a  physically  motivated  example  of  the  liquid  with  the 
non-canonical dissipation, which requires the general analysis of different 
models of dissipation and forcing. 
 
  As proposed by (Seidel & Maris 1994) the formation of structure by NZ 
theory  on  the  surface  of  a  levitated  superfluid  droplet,  is  possible. 
Because the surface of a levitated droplet has no boundaries, it is ideally-
suited for the study of non-linear interactions of capillary waves based on 
NZ theory. 
  Newell-Zakharov  theory  is  based  on  a  weak-turbulence  description  of 
the  waves  using  kinetic  equations.  The  growth  of  the  oscillations  is 
limited by cascade processes, as a result of which two Kolmogorov-type 
turbulent  spectra  are  formed.  So,  if  according  to  (Araki,  Tsubota  & 
Nemirovskii  2002;  Kobayashi  &  Tsubota  2005;  Kivotides  et  al.  2002), 

18

 

the  classical  regime  of  Kolmogorov  cascade  can  be  reached  in  the 
superfluid  dark  matter  (ρn  <<  ρs)  then  there  is  no  constraint  on  the  ratio 
ρs/ρ  for  the  cosmic  foam  formation  based  on  NZ;  otherwise  there  is  a 
constraint on the superfluid part of dark matter because for the structure 
formation  based  on  NZ  and  also  sequential  fragmentation  of  voids  in  a 
turbulent medium, the development of the Kolmogorov turbulent energy 
cascade is essential.  

 

  Cosmic foam is produced by agitation and the large-scale structure was 
born  on  the  surface  of  a  churning  liquid  phase.  The  voids  (bubbles) 
produced  under  conditions  where  strong  instabilities  in  the  interface  of 
two  phases  are  the  main  mechanism  for  bubble  (void)  production.  Such 
instabilities  are  believed  to  occur  during  liquid  wave  break-ups  or 
agitation of liquid-gas mixtures. Wave break-up fed by shaking energy is 
probably the main mechanism responsible to foam creation. 
 
 
2.3 Turbulent galaxy formation and clustering 
 
  (Gamov  1954)  suggested  that  the  space  and  mass  distributions  of 
galaxies were fossils of powerful primordial turbulence driven by the Big 
Bang because density fluctuations of the turbulence would influence the 
formation  of  such  gravitational  structures.  (Brown  1985)  explored  the 
idea  that  galaxies  might  have  resulted  from  eddies  in  a  turbulent  early 
universe.  He  has  explored  the  galaxy-forming  potential  of  an  early 
universe  that  fragmented  in  the  presence  of  large  scale  shearing  flows 
arising from turbulence. He also concludes that the dark matter must have 
accompanied  the  luminous  matter  in  the  viscous  evolution  in  order  to 
maintain the required gravitational potential. 
 
  Fragmentation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the structure formation of 
the  Universe  from  the  sequential  fragmentation  of  the  voids  to  the 
formation of the first galaxies and stars.  
   
  On the basis of our top-down model, after the formation of cosmic foam 
layer, a probable and plausible scenario for turbulent galaxy formation is:     
  Dark  matter  flow  or  coherent  motions  can  be  induced  by  the  fluid 
dynamics of the cosmic foam itself (such as cosmic foam drainage, local 
fluid  flow,  etc.).  Therefore  in  this  case  the  coherent  motions  in  foam 
sheets  become  turbulent  and  the  protogalaxies  and  the  first  massive 
galaxies  will  form  from  coherent  structures  like  eddies,  vortices,  etc.: 
Coherent structures emerge from chaos, under the action of an external 
constraint (instability of the inflectional basic velocity profile). 

19

 

 
  Turbulence always starts at small scales and cascades to large, therefore 
the  formation  of  the  clusters  of  galaxies  in  foam  sheets  is  bottom-up. 
(Krishan & Sivaram 1991) and (Prabhu & Krishan 1994) showed that the 
clustering and superclustering of galaxies and clusters respectively could 
be  viewed  as  the  outcome  of  the  ‘‘inverse  cascade’’  process  in  an 
incompressible  turbulent  medium.  Thus,  the  universe  is  a  hierarchy  of 
eddies. Eddies towards the small scale end can be identified with galaxies 
and  those  towards  the  large,  the  superclusters  (Figs.  2  and  3).  Here  we 
suggest  a  physical  mechanism  based  on  inverse  cascading  which  quite 
naturally yields a bottom-up hierarchical structure.

  In order for any physical process to operate in an expanding universe, its 
characteristic  time  scale  must  be  shorter  than  H-1(t).  In  the  case  of 
turbulence,  the  relevant  time  scale  is  that  of  the  nonlinear  interaction 
among eddies l/v(l), where l = a(t)π/k is the physical size corresponding 
to  the  wavenumber  k  (k  is  a  wavenumber  defined  with  respect  to  the 
comoving  coordinates  xi),    a(t)  is  cosmic  scale  factor  or  the  expansion 

parameter,  and  v(l)  is  given  by

turbulent  velocity  corresponding  to  k  and  E(k)  is  the  turbulent  kinetic 
energy spectrum; so that the above condition becomes 
l/v(l) ≤ H-1
  In  transition  to  superfluidity,  a  dense  system  of  strongly  interacting 
particles can be represented in the low-energy corner by a dilute system 
of  weakly  interacting  “elementary  excitations”  or  “quasiparticles” 
(Khalatnikov 1965). During and after the formation of turbulent coherent 
structures  the  compressibility  was  increased.  According  to  (Wetterich 

2003) a bound |R|=

velocity of sound in the medium is reduced (compressibility is increased) 
and  this  process  has  the  main  influence  on  the  process  of  structure 
formation  (transition  to  gravitational  instability).  It  is  possible  that  this 
monotonically  increasing  trend  of  w  extend  to  high-redshifts.  Then 
nonlinear  gravitational,  cooling  and  thin-shell  instabilities  may  play 
significant  roles  in  the  fragmentation  of  cosmological  sheets  (Anninos, 
Norman  &  Anninos  1995).  So 
fragmented  under 
hydrodynamical and gravitational instabilities and the first stars form by 
the  interplay  between  supersonic  turbulence  and  self-gravity  (Klessen 
2001).  When  the  energy  density  of  the  BEC  or  superfluid  part  of  DM 
exceeds  some  critical  value,  the  condensates  rapidly  collapses  on  the 
turbulent  coherent  structures  (maybe  into  some  structures  like  compact 
boson  stars  and  black  holes)  and  forms  SFDM  (equivalent  of  ΛCDM) 
which work as the standard cold dark matter halo of galaxies.

3.1    Strong  intra-cluster  motions  and  the  fluid  dynamics  of  the  cosmic 
foam (large coherent velocity flows) 
 
  The  peculiar  velocities  originate  from  motions  of  galaxies  within 
gravitationally  bound  systems  but  mainly  from  strong  coherent  motions 
in  matter  because  of  dynamical  evolution  of  the  cosmic  foam    such  as 
cosmic  foam  drainage,  local  fluid  flow,  flow  through  Plateau  border 
junctions  (in  liquid  foams,  the  liquid  largely  resides  in  a  network  of 

22

 

vertices  and  edges  –the  Plateau  borders.  Maybe  the  cosmological 
attractors  are  Plateau  borders);  (Figure  4).  For  example,  the  Great 
Attractor  seems  to  be  going  with  the  flow  rather  than  causing  it 
(Mathewson  &  Ford  1994).  The  flow  is  not  uniform  over  the  Great 
Attractor region. It seems to be associated with the denser regions which 
participate  in  the  flow  of  amplitude  about  400  km  s-1.  In  the  less  dense 
regions,  the  flow  is  small  or  nonexistent.  This  makes  the  flow  quite 
asymmetric and inconsistent with that expected from large-scale, parallel 
streaming flow that includes all galaxies out to 6000 km s-1 as previously 
thought. The flow cannot be modeled by a Great Attractor at 4300 km s-1 
or the Centaurus clusters at 3500 km s-1. Indeed, from the density maps 
derived  from  the  redshift  surveys  of  "optical"  and  IRAS  galaxies,  it  is 
difficult  to  see  how  the  mass  concentrations  can  be  responsible 
particularly as they themselves participate in the flow. These results bring 
into question the generally accepted reason for the peculiar velocities of 
galaxies  that  they  arise  solely  as  a  consequence  of  infall  into  the  dense 
regions  of  the  universe.  Also,  Hudson  (1994)  finds  that  the  Centaurus-
Hydra-Virgo and Pave supercluster complex is not primarily responsible 
for the large streaming motions of galaxies. Hudson believes that most of 
the  bulk  motion  of  the  405  km  s-1  which  is  required  to  agree  with  the 
predicted motion of the Local Group is due to sources beyond 8000 km s-
1. The main difficulty that the standard theory faces is to explain why the 
large visible mass centers of the Local Universe do not appear to produce 
large-scale  flows  but  instead  fully  participate  in  the  flows  themselves. 
Has the flow of the Great Wall been detected?

3.2  Thermodynamic instability of cosmic foam  
 
   Many naturally occurring structures, from the common soap froth to the 
large-scale distribution of galaxies in the universe, consist of statistically 
homogeneous domains separated from each other by distinct boundaries. 
These  boundaries  are  associated  with  an  interfacial  energy  (surface 
energy in three dimensions, wall energy in two dimensions). If the total 
energy  is  simply  the  product  of  the  boundary  area  times  a  ‘surface 
tension’  or  surface  energy,  any  reduction  in  total  interfacial  area  will 
reduce  the  energy.  Hence  such  structures  are  intrinsically  unstable, 
always  evolving  towards  patterns  with  less  surface  area,  unless  other 
factors  (such  as  boundary  pinning  or  short-range  repulsive  forces) 
intervene.  The  basic  mechanism  to  reduce  interfacial  area  is  the 
elimination of entire domains (Glazier & Weaire 1992). 
 
 
3.3  Precise determination of observed void size distribution (lognormal 
void size distribution) 
 
  One  of  the  important  differences  between  other  models  of  structure 
formation  and  my  model  (based  on  the  hydrodynamic  instability)  is  the 
predicted void size distribution; our model, based on the break up of the 
voids  in  a  turbulent  regime,  predicts  the  observed  lognormal  void  size 
distribution,  but  the  simulated  PDFs  of  void  size  in  other  models 
(expansion  of  underdensities  or  explosion  models)  have  some  degree  of 
disagreement to the observations.  
 
 
3.4  Prevention from shock wave problem of plasma turbulence theories 
 
  Our model helps to avoid one serious problem of all plasma turbulence 
models  including  that  of  Goldman  &  Canuto  (1993):  For  turbulent 
velocities,  in  other  models,  one  must  expect  the  generation  of  shock 
waves  at  large  scales  because  of  the  decrease  in  the  csound  at  decoupling 
epoch. Since these are not observed (Peebles 1980, 1993). In our model 
based on LTPTs, the problem will be avoided.

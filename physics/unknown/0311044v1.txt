Abstract : 

The  studies  realized  in  INRNE  (Institute  for  Nuclear  Research  and  Nuclear  Energy)  particulary  in 

cosmic rays detection and construction of Muonic Cerenkov Telescope in University of Blagoevgrad 

[1] shows the need to develop a theoretical model based on observed phenomenon and to refine it for 

the  detection  system  optimisation.  The  effect  was  introduced  in  EGS4  [2]  code  system.  The  first 

simulations were consecrated to different geometry’s of water tank in  total reflection. The model was 
compared  with  experimental  data  realised  with  gamma  source  60Co  using  the  telescope.  A  simple 

atmospheric model is introduced in EGS4. The comparison between CORSIKA [3] and EGS4 codes 

A Muonic telescope (fig.1) is developed in INRNE and University of Blagoevgrad Bulgaria [1]. The 

destination    is  the  registration  of  secondary  muons  and  measuring  the  cosmic  rays  variations.  The 

telescope is based on 18 water Cerenkov detectors split in 2 slabs of 3x3 cells.  

The  dimensions  of  the  tanks  are  50x50x12cm.  The  penetrating  muons  creates  Cerenkov  photons 

unregistered by photomultipliers (fig.2). The telescope is under absorber so the electrons are rejected. 

The  modelling  of  the  processes  and  the  development  of  theoretical  model  based  on  observed 

phenomenon  is  necessary  to  calibration  and  system  optimisation.  Most  of  the  available  codes 

permitting the simulation of Cerenkov effect are limited to one medium and geometry -Corsika code

permitting  the  Monte  Carlo  simulation  of  electron-photon  showers  in  different  media  give  us  the  

possibility to use it.  

2.Theoretical  studies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Cerenkov  radiation  is  emitted  if  the  velocity  v  of  charged  particles  exceeds  the  local  speed  of 

light which is given by the local  refractive index  of the medium n and the vacuum speed of light c 

[4]. So the condition of the effect is

photons per cm. 

The absorption of photons in the medium is not taken into account. The first step was consecrated to 

simulation  of  water Cerenkov detector in total reflection. The water is chosen for practical reasons 

existing detector and the model experimental verification. The photon trajectory is not simulated. The 

obtained results shows dependence in function of tank geometry and the energy of primary particle 

corresponding  to  our  expectations  because  the  effect  is  a  treshold  phenomenon.  The  number  of 

charged particles increase slightly with the lateral dimensions of the tank and is from a given energy 

almost constant (fig.3) . So the  quantity of Cerenkov photons saturation in function of tank’s depth is 

observed. An additional  Monte Carlo code « TRAMEAN » for  the mean  trajectory  calculation and 

(cid:242)
for  the  detection  efficiency  optimisation  is  made.  The  increasing  of  photomultiplier  surface  and 

decreasing of mean photon path results to efficiency increasing.  

 

2.Experimental studies 
The experimental studies was realized using a little most efficient tank and gamma source 60Co. The 

penetrating in the tank gamma quantum creates Compton electrons which creates Cerenkov photons. 

For  the  calibration  and  experimental  verification  of  the  model  we  need  the  different  quantities  of 

photons produced in the tank. So the response was measured for three depths of water in function of 

the systems off-set voltage -10 min. per experimental point (fig.4). The research of the working point 

corresponding to the best efficiency of PM is made using an approximation. On the other hand the 

total  number  of  Cerenkov  photons  in  the  tank  is  calculated  with  EGS4.  The  additional  modelling 

shows 79.2% efficiency of registration. On the other hand the photomultipliers registration efficiency

is  10%.  Moreover  one  can  see  the  similar  behaviour  of  experimental  and  theoretical  calculations 

(fig.5).  

 

3 Additional studies 

Other possible verification of the model is the comparison with another code for simulation the  

Cerenkov effect. We have introduced a simple model of the atmosphere in the EGS4. The atmosphere  

is divided in 21 layers of 5 km thickness. The variation of the refractive index is taken into account. 

This is important for the lateral distribution function of Cerenkov light. This simple model permits 

also to track the shower development. The angle of Cerenkov photons emission is also simulated with 

a  full  analogy  with  UPHI  subroutine.  The    comparison    with  CORSIKA  code    is  realized in large 

energetic  range.  We  take  into  account  only  the  total    number    of    Cerenkov    photons    at    sea  

observation  level. The results are shown in (fig.6). So replacing in EGS4 the electron rest mass with a 

muon rest mass and using our model the response simulation  of the telescope is possible

The  introduction  of  Cerenkov  effect  in  Egs4  code  system  was  made.  This  gives  a  possibility  to 

simulate the response of detectors based in registration of Cerenkov radiation in different media. On 

the  other  hand  the  calibration  of  existing  muon  telescope  and  system  registration  optimisation  is 

possible. The proposed methodology is based on experimental studies and on Monte Carlo simulation 

of  the  response.  Our  model  gives  a  possibility  to  simulate  the  response  of  detectors  based  in 

registration  of  Cerenkov  radiation  in  different  media.  On  the  other  hand  the  calibration  of  existing

on experimental studies and on Monte Carlo simulation of the response.

Previous efforts in complex networks research focused mainly on the topological features of 

such  networks,  but  now  also  encompass  the  dynamics.  In  this  Letter  we  discuss  the 

relationship  between  structure  and  dynamics,  with  an  emphasis  on  identifying  whether  a 

topological hub, i.e. a node with high degree or strength, is also a dynamical hub, i.e. a node 

with  high  activity.  We  employ  random  walk  dynamics  and  establish  the  necessary 

conditions  for  a  network  to  be  topologically  and  dynamically  fully  correlated,  with 

topological hubs that are also highly active. Zipf’s law is then shown to be a reflection of the 

match  between  structure  and  dynamics  in  a  fully  correlated  network,  as  well  as  a 

consequence  of  the  rich-get-richer  evolution  inherent  in  scale-free  networks.  We  also 

examine  a  number  of  real  networks  for  correlations  between  topology  and  dynamics  and 

find that many of them are not fully correlated.  

We address the relationship between structure and dynamics of complex networks by taking the 

steady-state distribution of the frequency of visits to nodes – a dynamical feature – obtained by 

performing random walks1 along the networks.  A complex network2-5 is taken as a graph with

directed edges with associated weights, which are represented in terms of the weight matrix W. 

The N nodes in the network are numbered as i = 1, 2, …, N and a directed edge with weight M, 

extending from  node j to  node i, is represented as W(i, j) = M. No  self-connections  (loops) are 

considered. The in- and outstrength of a node i – abbreviated as os(i) and is(i), correspond to the 

sum of the weights of the in- and outbound connections, respectively. The stochastic matrix S for 

such a network is  

S(i, j) = W(i, j) / os(j) 

(1) 

 
The matrix S is assumed irreducible, i.e. any of its nodes can be accessible from any other node, 

which  allows  the  definition  of  a  unique  and  stable  steady  state.  An  agent,  placed  at  any  initial 

node  j,  chooses  among  the  adjacent  outbound  edges  of  node  j  with  probability  equal  to  S(i,  j). 

This  step  is  repeated  a  large  number  of  times  T,  and  the  frequency  of  visits  to  each  node  i  is 

calculated as v(i) = (number of visits during the walk)/T.  In the steady state (i.e. after a long time 

period  T), 

r =
v

r
vS

  and  the  frequency  of  visits  to  each  node  along  the  random  walk  may  be 

calculated  in  terms  of  the  eigenvector  associated  to  the  unit  eigenvalue.  For  proper  statistical 

normalization  we  set

(

.    The  dominant  eigenvector  of  the  stochastic  matrix  has 

∑

p

theoretically  and  experimentally  been  verified  to  be  remarkably  similar  to  the  corresponding 

eigenvector of the weight matrix, implying that the adopted random  walk  model  shares  several 

features with other types of dynamics, including linear and non-linear summation of activations 

and flow in networks. 

With  the  frequency  of  visits  to  nodes  (i.e.  the  ‘activity’  of  the  nodes)  obtained  as  above,  the 

correlation  between  activity  and topology  can  be  quantified  in  terms  of  the  Pearson  correlation

coefficient,  r.  For  full  correlation,  i.e.  r  =  1,  two  conditions  must  be  jointly  satisfied:  (i)  the 

network must be completely connected, i.e. S is irreducible, and (ii) for any node, the instrength 

must be equal to the outstrength.  

The  proof  of  the  statement  above  is  as  follows.  Because  the  network  is  fully  connected,  its 

stochastic  matrix  S  has  a  unit  eigenvector  in  the  steady  state,  i.e. 

r =

visits and corresponding node strengths. 

An  implication  of  this  derivation  is  that  for  perfectly  correlated  networks,  the  frequency  of 

symbols  produced  by  random  walks  will  be  equal  to  the  outstrength/instrength  distributions. 

Therefore, an outstrength scale-free3 network must produce sequences obeying Zipf’s law6, and 

vice  versa.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  node  distribution  is  Gaussian,  the  frequency  of  visits  to 

nodes will also be a Gaussian function; that is to say, the distribution of nodes is replicated in the 

node activation. A fully correlated network will have r = 1. This is illustrated in Fig. 1a and b, 

which show r = 1 for a text by Darwin7 and the network of airports in the USA8. Zipf’s law is 

known to apply to the former type of networks9.

Fig.  1  –  The  activity  (frequency  of  visits)  of  each  node  in  terms  of  its  instrength  (also  called  cumulative  1st 

hierarchical instrength, as explained below) for the networks obtained from Darwin’s text (a) and American airports 

(b). The word association network was obtained by representing each distinct word as a node while the edges were 

established  by  the  sequence  of  immediately  adjacent  words  in  the  texts  after  the  removal  of  stopwords10  and 

lemmatization11.  More specifically, the fact that word U has been followed by word V M times during the text is 

represented  as  W(V,U)  =  M.  The  airports  network  presents  a  link  between  two  airports  if  there  exists  at  least  one 

flight between them. The number of flights performed in one month was used as the strength of the edges. 

We  obtained  r  for  various  real  networks  (Table  1),  including  the  fully  correlated  networks 

mentioned above. To interpret these data, we recall that a small r means that a hub (large in- or 

outstrength) in topology is not necessarily a center of activity. Notably, in all cases considered r 

is greater for the in- than for the outstrength. This may be understood with a trivial example of a 

node from which a high number of links emerge (implying large outstrength) but which has only 

very  few  inbound  links.  This  node,  in  a  random  walk  model,  will  be  rarely  occupied  and  thus 

cannot  be  a  center  of  activity,  though  it  will  strongly  affect  the  rest  of  the  network  by  sending 

activation to many other targets. Understanding why a hub in terms of instrength may fail to be 

very  active  is  more  subtle.  Consider  a  central  node  receiving  links  from  many  other  nodes 

4

arranged in a circle, i.e. the central node has a large instrength, but with the surrounding nodes 

possessing small instrength. In other words, if a node i receives several links from nodes with low 

activity, this node i will likewise be fairly inactive. In order to further analyze the latter case, we 

may examine the correlations between the frequency of visits to each node i and the cumulative 

hierarchical  in-  and  outstrengths  of  that  node.  The  hierarchical  degrees12-14  of  a  network  node 

provide a natural extension of the traditional concept of node degree. The cumulative hierarchical 

outstrength  of  a  node  i  at  the  hierarchical  level h  corresponds  to  the  sum  of  the  weights  of  the 

edges extending from the hierarchical level h to the subsequent level h+1, plus the outstrengths 

obtained from hierarchy 1 to h-1. Similarly, the cumulative instrength of a node i at hierarchical 

level h is the sum of the weights of the edges from hierarchical level h+1 to the previous level h, 

plus the instrengths obtained from hierarchy 1 to h-1. The traditional in- and outstrength are the 

cumulative  hierarchical  in-  and  outstrength  at  hierarchical  level  1  (see  Supplementary  Methods 

for a more detailed definition of cumulative hierarchical degree). Because complex networks are 

often also small world structures, it suffices to consider hierarchies up to 2 or 3 edges. 

 

 

For the least correlated network analyzed, viz. that of the largest connected cluster in the network 

of  WWW  links  between  the  pages  contained  in the  massey.ac.nz  domain  (Massey  University  - 

New Zealand)15,  16 – Fig. 2, activity could not be related to instrength at any hierarchical level. 

Because the Pearson coefficient corresponds to a single real value, it cannot adequately express 

the co-existence of the many relationships between activity and degrees present in this specific 

network,  as  well  as  possibly  heterogeneous  topologies.  Very  similar  results  were  obtained  for 

other  WWW  network,  which  indicates  that  the  reasons  why  topological  hubs  have  not  been 

highly  active  cannot  be  identified  at  the  present  moment  (see,  however,  discussion  for  higher 

correlated networks below).

Fig. 2 – Analysis of the correlation between activity and node instrength for the WWW links between New Zealand 

domains. No clear correlation exists with respect to the cumulative 1st hierarchical in- (a) or outstrengths (b). Such a 

result is a consequence of the great intricacy of this large network, which involves several correlation substructures, 

which cannot be expressed into the single Pearson correlation coefficient. 

However,  for  the  two  neuronal  structures  of  Table  1  that  are  not  fully  correlated,  activity  was 

shown  to  increase  with  the  cumulative  1st  and  2nd  hierarchical  instrengths,  as  illustrated  in 

comparing  Fig.  3a  and  3b  for  the  network  defined  by  the  interconnectivity  between  cortical 

regions of the cat17. Similar results were obtained for the network of synaptic connections in C. 

Elegans18.  In  the  cat  cortical  network,  each  cortical  region  is  represented  as  a  node,  and  the 

interconnections are reflected by the network edges. Significantly, in a previous paper19, it was 

shown  that  when  connections  between  cortex  and  thalamus  were  included,  the  correlation 

between  activity  and  outdegree  increased  significantly.  This  could  be  interpreted  as  a  result  of 

increased efficiency with the topological hubs becoming highly active.

Because of the many factors that may cause hubs failing to be active, one may gain insights into 

the importance of cumulative hierarchical instrengths by considering the model shown in Fig. 4a. 

Here, a star-shaped subnetwork (left-hand side of the figure) has been randomly attached, through 

P incoming edges, to a larger random network containing 50 nodes and 250 directed edges (right-

hand side of the figure). Note that the cumulative hierarchical indegree of node i at hierarchy 1 is 

equal to M (number of incoming neighbors), and its cumulative hierarchical indegree at hierarchy 

2 is equal to M + P. We quantified the activity at node i in terms of several values of P for 100 

different realizations (i.e. varying the target of the interconnections), obtaining the graph shown 

in Fig. 4b. The graph points to two regimes: an brief initial portion observed for small values of 

P,  indicating  strong  positive  correlation  between  the  activity  and  cumulative  hierarchical 

indegree,  followed  by  a  region  of  saturation,  where  the  correlation  is  greatly  diminished.  The 

region with small correlation grows when the number of connections P is increased relatively to 

the  number  of  nodes  in  the  larger  network.  This  construction  involving  two  attached  networks 

has also been considered for studying the effect of varying levels of clustering coefficients of the 

 

8

reference node i. The results, also obtained after 100 realizations of each case, are shown in the 

Fig. 4c, from which it is clear that the increase of the clustering coefficient reduces the relative 

activation of the reference node, as the random walk agent will spend more time going from each 

of the neighbors. Therefore, both the cumulative hierarchical degree structure and the clustering 

coefficient  contribute  to  changing  the  correlation  between  activation  and  node  degree  in  subtle 

ways.

Fig.  4  –  The  correlation  between  the  activity  of  node  i  and  its  cumulative  2nd  hierarchical  indegree  can  be 

investigated  by  randomly  attaching  a  subnetwork  such  as  that  in  the  left-hand  portion  of  the  structure  in  (a)  to  a 

substantially larger network (right-hand side). The two networks are connected through P directed edges which come 

from the right-hand side (9 in the case of this example, plus one edge in the opposite direction, to ensure a connected 

network), plus a single edge extending from left to right (in red). The curve quantifying the activity in terms of the 

cumulative  1st  hierarchical  degree  for  node  i,  considering  100  realizations  for  each  connectivity,  is  shown  in  (b), 

being characterized by two regimes. For P < 10, there is high positive correlation, while the correlation is diminished 

for P > 10. The effect of increasing clustering coefficients on reducing the activation of the reference node is shown 

in (c). 

 

 

 

This  model  shows  that  a  node  linked  to  a  set of  highly  connected  nodes  with  large  cumulative 

hierarchical  instrengths,  is  likely  to  be  more  active  than  another  node  with  the  same  instrength 

(cumulative  1st  hierarchical  instrength)  but  lower  cumulative  2nd  hierarchical  instrength,  as 

indicated  by  the  results  of  the  neuronal  networks  already  discussed.  Nevertheless,  a  more 

thorough  analysis  of  such  dependencies  should  consider  the  activation  flow  between  nodes. 

Furthermore,  for  the  fully  correlated  networks,  such  as  word  associations  obtained  for  texts  by 

Darwin7  and  Wodehouse20,  activity  increased  basically  with  the  square  of  the  cumulative  2nd 

hierarchical instrength (see Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, the correlations obtained for these 

two  authors  are  markedly  distinct,  as  the  Wodehouse  work  is  characterized  by  substantially 

steeper  increase  of  frequency  of  visits  for  large  instrength  values  (see  Supplementary  Fig.  3). 

Therefore, the results considering higher cumulative hierarchical degrees may serve as a feature 

for authorship identification.  

In conclusion, we have established a set of conditions for full correlation between topological and 

dynamical  features  of  complex  networks,  and  demonstrated  that  Zipf´s  law  can  be  naturally 

10

derived for fully correlated networks. In the cases where the network is not fully correlated, the 

Pearson  coefficient  may  be  used  as  a  characterizing  parameter.  For  a  network  with  very  small 

correlation, such as the WWW links between the pages in a New Zealand domain analyzed here, 

the  reasons  for  hubs  failing  to  be  active  could  not  be  identified,  probably  because  of  the 

substantially  higher  complexity  and  heterogeneity  of  this  network,  including  varying  levels  of 

clustering  coefficients,  as  compared  to  the  neuronal  networks.  For  the  latter,  it  was  possible  to 

verify  that  the  correlation  between  activity  and  topology  is  enhanced  if  higher  cumulative 

hierarchical  instrengths  were  taken  into  account.  With  an  artificially-constructed  network,  we 

demonstrated  this  should  indeed  be  expected  and  found  that  higher  clustering  coefficients 

contribute to decreasing activity.

SUPLEMENTARY METHODS 

Cumulative Hierarchical Degrees 

The concepts of cumulative hierarchical in- and outdegree are defined for a given node i taking 

into consideration its hierarchical level. The cumulative 1st hierarchical indegree is the number of 

incoming  edges  extending  from  the  immediate  neighbors  of  node  i  into  that  node,  i.e.  it 

corresponds to the traditional indegree of node i. These neighbors constitute the 1st hierarchical 

level (see Supplementary Fig. 1). This number of connections between the hierarchical levels 0 

and  1  plus  those  between  levels  1  and  2  define  the  cumulative  2nd  level  hierarchical  indegree. 

More  generally,  the  cumulative  hierarchical  indegree  of  node  i  at  hierarchy  h  is  equal  to  the 

number of directed edges extending from the nodes at hierarchy h+1 to the nodes at hierarchical 

level  h,  plus  the  indegrees  obtained  from  hierarchy  1  to  h-1.  The  cumulative  hierarchical 

outdegrees  are  calculated  similarly,  but  considering  opposite  edge  directions.  The  cumulative 

hierarchical in- and outstrenghts are analogously defined, taking into account the weights of the 

edges (instead of only the number of edges).

ABSTRACT 

 
     It is well known that magnetic force between two current carrying conductors  is a relativistic manifestation of net 
electrostatic force between relatively moving electrons & protons of the two wires. On similar grounds but with more 
accurate  considerations    i.e.,  of  second  order  relativistic  considerations,    it  is  shown  here    that  gravitational-force 
between two bodies is in-fact due to relativistic manifestation of net electrostatic force between protons & revolving 
electrons  in  atoms  of  the  two  bodies.    As  special-relativity  provides  a  bridge  between  electricity  and  magnetism,  in 
somewhat similar way (as described in the paper) it is shown that once again it is the special-relativity  which provides 
the much sought-after link between electrostatic force and gravitational force. If magnetism is the first-order (velocity-
dependant) effect of moving electrons in conductor, gravitation is the second-order (acceleration-dependant) effect of 
revolving  electrons  in  atoms.    The  new  proposed  gravitation-theory  seems  to  be  well    in  accordance  with  gravity 
behavior        i.e., it  correctly  predicts  that  gravity    is  a  long-range  attractive-force    proportional  to masses    &  follows 
inverse-square-law  and is transmitted with the velocity of light.   
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
 
Gravity  is  the  most  common  force  around  us.  But  it  is  surprising  that,  although  there  was 
Newton’s formula for gravitation, there was no explanation for ‘why gravity is there’ till Einstein’s [1-4] 
explanation (1915). Alternative theories of gravity  have been reported occasionally, specially on net, such 
as Kaluza-Klein theory [4-6] and others [7-11], though appealing  but not with much acceptance/success.  
Einstein,  through  general-relativity,  explains  that  gravity    is  not  a  force    but  appears  to  be  so    due  to 
curvature  of  4-dimensional  space-time.    Einstein’s  general-relativity  [1-4]  is  built  on  Riemannian  curved 
geometry. It appears as if  the gravity is disguised as space-time curvature in tensor notations.  Einstein’s 
general-relativity, however, has attained grand success. 
 
 
Gravitational  force  (Newton’s  formula)  is  similar  to  Electrostatic  force  (Coulomb’s  formula)  in 
many ways. Both follow inverse square law and are long range force. Thus it is tempting to find a clue of 
gravitational force into electrostatic force. The author proposes such a theory in this paper and claims that 
‘gravitation is  due to second-order relativistic-manifestation of electrostatic-force’. 
 
 
Out of the 5 forces namely: electrostatic, magnetic, gravitational, weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear 
forces;  the  electrostatic  &  magnetic  forces  are  already  united  (by  Faraday/Maxwell)  as  electro-magnetic 
force [12].  The electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force were further unified through  QED, Feynman 
rules, symmetry, group theory, gauge theory & renormalization etc.[13]  ( by Glashow, Weinberg, Salam) 
as  electro-weak  force  [13].  On  similar  lines  with  quantum-chromodynamics  (QCD)    the  strong  force  is 
further  considered  unified  leading  to  Standard-Model  /  GUT  [13-18].  The  standard  model  has  been 
extremely  successful;  but  problem  is  with  the  unification  of  gravitation    as  gravity  seems  to  be  quite 
‘refractive’ (difficult) toward unification [15-18]. The superstring/M(brane)- theory [15-20] and its variant 
supergravity/quantum-gravity,  currently,  are  the  leading  candidates  for  final  unification;  it  however  talks 
more  of  the  mathematics  of  much  higher  dimensions.  The  present  paper,    could  interestingly    provide  a 
possible simple link of gravitation to electromagnetic force;  it is shown that as if  gravitation is a ‘second-
order effect’ of electrostatic  force  as   magnetism is the  ‘first-order effect’ of electrostatic force,   or  in 
other words  as if  gravity is a second-order effect of magnetism between atoms.

It is well known that special-relativity is the ‘bridge’ between electricity and magnetism [12,21].        

 
In  the  present  paper  it  is  shown  that  ‘how  special-relativity  is  able  to  provide  further  link  between 
electrostatic force and gravitational force’. A brief review is given (in the following section - 2) however,    
to show  how the relativity provides a bridge between electricity & magnetism,  to illuminate the concept 
for  further  utilizing  this  approach  (with  little  refinement/accuracy  taking  the  relativistic  velocity  addition 
into account) subsequently (in sections - 3 & 4) for linking of  electrostatic force to gravitational force. 
 
 
2. Magnetism as First-order Relativistic-Manifestation of Electrostatic-Force 
 
 
Very few people appreciate that magnetism is an effect of electricity via relativity. In literature & 
books  it  is  explained  in  several  ways.  Faraday  &  Maxwell  Equations  relate  electricity  &  magnetism 
mathematically. Simple good explanations are found in some books [12,21], the ‘simplified’ approach [21] 
is briefly described in the next paragraph to illuminate the concept  for extending it further  in section-3  for 
explaining gravitation. 
 
 
Consider two parallel conductors I and II carrying current in same direction. Let the electrons and 
protons in conductor-I  be  A1 & P1, and that in conductor-II  be  A2 & P2. The electrons A1 see A2 at rest 
and P2  moving  with velocity v in opposite direction   and  thus there is a  length contraction  by  an amount  
½  v2/c2  =  β2/2  for  spacing  between  protons,  or  in  other  words  more  number  of  protons  appear  in  the 
conductor-II.  Similarly, to proton P1 more electrons appear in conductor-II. This leads to a net attraction 
between  the  two  conductors  proportional  to  v2/c2    which  otherwise  normally  is  considered  to  be  due  to 
magnetic effect (which  in fact   is   first-order relativistic-manifestation of electrostatic-force). 
 
 
3. The New Theory of Gravitation :  
    Gravitation  as  Second-Order  Relativistic-Manifestation  of  Electrostatic-Force 
 
 
It is well known, as explained above, that magnetism is a relativistic-effect of electrostatic force. 
On  similar  lines  the  concept  is  further  extended  to  show  that  even  gravity  too  is  a  relativistic-effect  of 
electrostatic  force.  This  new  theory  of  gravity  is  proposed  &  explained  in  this  section.  The  emphasis, 
however,  is  on  the  concept  &  qualitative  aspects    rather  than  on  an  accurate  quantitative  analysis.  For 
simplicity   and to make it more illustrative -  a simple  model  is described as following. 
 
 
Consider two atoms one each in two bodies I & II. For clarity of explanation consider ‘Helium’- 
like  atoms.  The  two  electrons  are  A1  &  B1  and  the  two  protons  are  grouped  as  P1  in  body-I,  and  that  in 
body-II  are  A2  &  B2  and  P2  (Fig.1,  neutrons  omitted    are  not  shown).  For  simplicity  it  is  assumed  that 
electrons revolve in circular-type orbits and  let their orbits, though in two bodies, be in same Y-Z plane. 
Consider  both  electrons  in  the  two  orbits  revolving  clockwise.  Furthermore,  the  position  of  electrons  are 
considered  to  be  such  that  (Fig.1)  A1  &  A2  are  moving  in  parallel(same)  direction  and  that  A1  &  B2  are 
moving in antiparallel(opposite) direction each with velocity v.  With this arrangement, the net attraction or 
repulsion factor between atoms in I and II can be found considering length contraction and are tabulated in 
the  important  Table  1,    without  relativistic  velocity  addition  in  the  middle  column    and  with  relativistic 
velocity addition in the last column.  
 
The author calls ‘length-contraction without relativistic velocity addition’ as ‘first-order relativistic 
 
effect’  and ‘length-contraction with relativistic velocity addition’, as ‘second-order relativistic effect’. It is 
to be noted (see Total in the table) that only the simple length contraction which is able to link electricity 
and magnetism, here fails to provide any resultant attraction between two atoms of the two bodies unless 
relativistic velocity addition is taken into account before the length contraction. Thus (in view of  Fig.1 and 
Table 1),  it  can  be  said  that  ‘gravitation    is    due  to    second  order  relativistic  effect  of  electrostatic  force 
between  atoms  of  the  two  bodies’.    Even  if      it  is  considered  that    the  electrons  in  body-I  revolving 
clockwise and that in body-II revolving anti-clockwise , the net result (last row of Total  in Table 1) would 
be same.  So, the second-order effect  always causes net attraction between two matter-bodies  irrespective 
of  direction of electron rotation.

The clue to link gravitational and electrostatic forces lies in the relativistic velocity addition due to 
inherent asymmetry hidden in it. In fact the velocity addition must be made relativistically before the length 
contraction (or net attraction or repulsion factor) estimation. For example, A1, as observer sees, B2 moving 
not with velocity 2v but with velocity  2v/(1 + v2/c2). It is seen that thus the resultant net attraction factor 
(total  of  last  column  in  Table1)  is  not  zero    but  equal  to  8β4  =  8(v/c)4  due  to  relativistic  velocity  added 
length  contraction  in  Y-direction  (Fig.1).      For  ‘Hydrogen’-like  atom  this  factor  will  be  less,    and    can  
similarly  be shown to be only 2β4 . 

 
If  both  bodies-atoms  are  considered  to  lie  in  X-Z  or  X-Y  plane  (Fig.1),  similar  results  could  be 
found. However, if the orbit plane in body-I lies in Y-Z plane  but that in body-II lies in X-Y plane,  the 
velocity of electrons in body I and II being perpendicular, the length-contraction(attraction-factor) will be 
zero.  Hence  it  is  concluded  that  total  net  attraction  factor  between  two  bodies  (containing  many  atoms 
having different orbit orientations) would be very much less than β4. Moreover, the likelihood of electrons 
positions as shown in Fig.1 is extremely-small  estimated of the order of (r/R)4, r & R being the electron-
radius & orbit-radius respectively; thus the total net resultant attraction factor is further drastically reduced 
by this factor (as follows) . 
 
 
4. Derivation of  Newton’s gravitational formula  from  Coulomb’s electrostatic force formula        
    and  Estimation of Gravitational Constant  G 
 
Probability of the electron(of radius r) at point A1 on the electron’s orbital cloud shell (of radius R) 
 
is approx. (πr2)/(4πR2). Similar probability is for the electron A2. Probability for such combination as A1 & 
A2 as shown in Fig.1 is thus estimated  as of the order of  (r/R)4. The net attraction factor due to second 
order relativistic effect for atoms (Fig.1) shown in the Table1 is of the order of (v/c)4.  Thus, considering 
the  extremely  less  likelihood  of  electrons  positions  as  depicted  in  Fig  1,  the  total  net  resultant  attraction 
factor    is  proportional  to  (v/c)4.(r/R)4.  In  absence  of  a  more  generalized/accurate  analysis,  it  is  better  to 
write  the  total  net  resultant  attraction  factor  as    f    =  K.(v/c)n1.(r/R)n2.  Also,  only  a  small  fraction  of  
electrons  (say,  2%)  in  one  body  may  be  compatible(position  &  orbit  wise),  in  view  of  relativistic  length 
contraction, with similar small fraction of electrons in the other body; thus K << 1 of the order of 4 x10-4 .  
It  may,  however,    be  noted  here  that  in  present  paper  the  emphasis  is  on  the  qualitative-concepts    rather 
than quantitative-estimation;  so even a rough estimate with a simple model will suffice the purpose.  
 
Now consider a body has mass m1  kg = 103m1 gram, and atomic weight A gram  & atomic number 
 
Z;    thus  number  of  moles  =  103m1/A,  number  of  atoms  =  (103m1/A).AN    where  Avogadro-number  AN  = 
6.02x1023 .  So,  number of protons or electrons = (m1103/A).AN.Z . Using mass number A = N + Z  and 
taking number of  neutrons N ≅ Z approximately;  A ≅ 2.Z . Thus  number of protons or electrons present 
would approximately be   ½ AN. 103m1 in body-I  and  ½ AN. 103m2 in body-II. 
 
So attraction force between the two bodies I & II, considering the number of electrons & protons  
 
and the total net resultant attraction factor as mentioned above, is the gravitational attraction between two 
bodies  I  &  II    resulting  in      due  to    second-order  relativistic-manifestation  of  electrostatic-force    and  is 
given by: 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 

   = {1/(4πε)}.(½ AN. 103m1.e).[( ½ AN. 103m2.e).{K.(v/c)n1.(r/R)n2}] / d2 
    
  = G. m1.m2 /d2

Taking {1/(4πε)} = 9x109, e = 1.6x10-19,  AN = 6.02 x 1023 ,  average  v/c ≅ 10-2  &  r/R ≅ 10-6 and  

 
selecting/adjusting   values of   n1= 4,   n2 = 4,  K ≅ 4 x10-4 ,  the value of  G  is  roughly  estimated as         
8 x10-11 which is of the same order of magnitude of the known value of  6.7 x10-11   in  SI units.  
 
 
5. Predictions of the New Gravitation Theory 
 
(A) Predictions which are  well in accordance with Gravity 
 

This  new  theory  of  gravitation  claims  that  ‘gravitation  is  due  to  second-order  relativistic- 
manifestation  of  electrostatic-force’  on  similar  lines  as  magnetism  is  known  to  be  relativistic  effect  of 
electricity.  Thus  gravitational  force  is  an  aspect  of  electromagnetic  force.    The  predictions  of  this  new 
theory that are well in accordance  are that :  ‘Gravitational force between the two matter bodies -

is attractive,  
is proportional to their masses, 
follows inverse square law,  
is a long range force as that of the Coulomb’s force, but  
is much weaker in strength, and 
the gravitational-signal travels as that for electric-force with speed of light. 

Following  new  predictions  could  be  thus  made  from  this  new  gravitational  theory,  which  can 

(B) New predictions for Gravity  for test / re-interpretation 
  
 
possibly be tested / re-interpreted  by scientists - 
 
(i) 

Gravitational constant G is not a universal constant. It should depend on the materials (atoms) of 
the  attracting  bodies  for  which  average  electron-velocity  v  and  orbit-radius  R  could  be different 
for different materials. Also, G should depend on permittivity  ε  of the medium. The dependence 
could  possibly  be  averaged-out  and  counter-balanced  /  masked  by  other  effects,  so  difficult  to 
verify. 

(a) The force between two matter bodies (I and II) is attractive. But the force between one matter-
body (I)  and another antimatter-body (II) would be not-attracting but it would be repulsive as per 
this  new  proposed    theory  of  gravitation  (as  per  Fig.1  in  Table1  the  Total  would  be  then  –8β4, 
negative  sign  would  mean  repulsion).    Force  between  two  antimatter  bodies  will  again  be 
attractive.  It is interesting to note that although charged particle & antiparticle attract each other, 
but matter (atoms) & antimatter (anti-atoms) would repel each other. 
 
(b) If  antimatter (such as anti-hydrogen) is made to collide with high velocity onto the matter, the 
high  velocity  can  possibly  overcome  the  repulsion  between  matter  &  antimatter    and  ultimately 
should annihilate each other producing short bursts of energy. 
 
(a)  According  to  Einstein’s  general-relativity,  the  outer  space-time  is  ‘curved’  around  material-
body as if causing gravity. Although  Einstein’s theory has passed several tests, but  the real  test 
of space-time curvature is on-the-way at Stanford-University [22] under the able guidance of  Dr. 
Francis Everitt  with NASA & Lockheed-Martin collaboration.  The presently proposed  theory of  
gravitation    claims  that  gravitation    is    second  order  effect  of  special-relativity  on  electrostatic 
force  between  atoms    and    all  this  comes  because  electrons  revolve  in  ‘closed’  thus  ‘curved’ 
orbital-path inside the material-body.  According to Einstein -  the space-time curvature is outside 
the body  whereas as per the new theory -  the orbit-curvature is inside the body.  String-theory 
[14-18] also talks about inside  curl-up of extra-dimensions but in a different context & size .  

(b)  Probably,  Einstein’s  general-relativity-based  theory  and  the  author’s  special-relativity-based 
(second-order atomic-magnetism) theory of gravitation, both altogether different,  may still come 
to be compatible (outside curvature of space-time may possibly be imprint of inside curvature of

electron’s orbit  through gravity);  possibly some modification and/or  re-interpretation of either or 
both may be needed  or some fundamental change in the concepts have to be made. For example 
one such fundamental change, in the concept of mass, has been proposed by the author in another 
paper  [23]  whereas  it  is  suggested  that  in  general    the  mass  M    is    quaternion  (scalar  +  vector) 
quantity:  the  scalar-part  establishes  the  particle-aspects  and  the  vector-part  governs  the  wave-
behavior; which explains the differently-looking  wave & particle and its duality,  and also  in a 
way  makes   wide-differing subjects  ‘Special-relativity’ & ‘Quantum-mechanics’  compatible.   
 

 
5. Discussions  
 
 
The  author  means  by  ‘first-order’  and  ‘second-order’  relativistic  effects  as  follows:-  if  velocity 
addition  is  done    non-relativistically    and  length  contraction  of  relativity  is  used  then  it  is  considered  as 
first-order  relativity  effect,  whereas  if  velocity  addition  is  done  relativistically  and  length  contraction  of 
relativity  is  used    then  it  is  considered  as  second-order  (relativity  being  used  at  two-stages)  relativistic 
effect  (see  Table  1).  It  is  concluded  that  ‘gravitation  is  due  to  second-order  relativistic-manifestation  of 
electrostatic-force    resulting  in      due  to  revolving  motion  of  electrons  in  atoms  of  the  two  bodies,  in  the 
same way  as magnetism is the first order relativistic manifestation of electrostatic force resulting in due to 
linear motion of electrons in two conductors’. In nutshell it can be said that: ‘if magnetism is the first-order 
(velocity-dependant) effect,  gravitation is the second-order (as if  acceleration-dependant) effect’;   or  in 
other words,  ‘gravity is the second-order-relativistic  atomic-magnetism  due to  revolving-electrons’.  The 
acceleration-dependence means  being function of centripetal-acceleration v2/R  of the orbiting  electrons . 
 
 
There  exists  well  known  [21,24]  ‘van  der  Wall’    force  (attractive)  between  molecules  and  also 
between  atoms  even  without  any  consideration  of  length-contraction  or  relativity,  this  may  be  said  as  if 
‘zeroth-order’ relativistic effect, meaning with ‘no’ relativistic effect at all. In fact, the van der Wall force is 
also  manifestation  of  electrostatic  force,  but  due  to  charge-distribution.  This  attractive  force  varies 
effectively with ‘inverse of seventh power’ of separation distance d  and  thus is almost truly zero at large 
distances;    it  is  a  short-range  force  responsible  for  several  common  phenomena  such  as  condensation  of 
gases,  freezing of liquid to solid, surface tension, viscosity, friction etc.  But it can not lead to gravitational 
effect  as it is short range force and varies sharply as 1/d7.  Any other variation (other than inverse square), 
if any, such as 1/d3  too  can not be responsible for gravitation. 
 
 
It  is  true  that,  most  of  small  differences  don’t  make  much  of  a  difference,  but  if  the  small 
difference pops up at crucial point  then it can make all the difference [25]. The second-order relativistic 
manifestation is very small but it adds up to make all the difference by giving birth of gravity from atomic- 
electricity.    Einstein  himself  said  [25]  that  ‘Books  on  physics  are  full  of  complicated  formulae.  But 
thoughts and ideas, not formulae, are the beginning of every physical theory’. So, emphasis in the present 
paper is on the concept; and the simple formulation  seems good enough to begin with. The gravitational-
theory  presented  here  that  ‘gravitational  force  is  second  order  relativistic  manifestation  of  electrostatic 
force’ seems reasonably correct  as it very-rightly predicts that  gravitation is long range inverse square law 
force, having features quite similar to electrostatic force but with much smaller strength.  
 

The theory developed in the paper indicates that gravitation  is a weak  electro-magnetic effect of 
atoms  of  the  mass,  so  it  seems  somewhat  obvious  that  light  (the  electro-magnetic  wave)  should  show 
deflection  and  red-shift  in  presence  of  gravity    due  to    electro-magnetic  ‘interactions’.    Moreover,  as  
gravity  is  caused  due  to  velocity  (v)  of  orbiting-electrons  of  atoms  of  the  mass;  and  if  the  mass  (planet) 
itself  is  moving,  its  own-velocity  (u)    addition  would  change  the  gravitational  force  a  bit    to  cause  a 
possible    precession  (advance)  of  perihelion  of  the  planet.    Detailed  mechanism  /  understanding, 
explanation & calculations of these, not that easy,  need to be worked out, however.  The author’s theory 
suggests  that  gravitation  is  electro-magnetic  phenomenon  and  its  electromagnetic-interaction  with  the 
electro-magnetic-wave can cause  light to move in curved path in the medium near the star-mass;  which 
otherwise is understood in general-relativity  as if gravity is   no-force  but the space-time itself is curved 
around  the  mass    and    test-particle  moves  in  such  geodesic.    Also,  since  gravity-signal  is  due  to 
electromagnetic-effect  it travels with velocity of light , and the exchange-particle   would have properties 
similar to photon (zero rest mass) but spin may be different than 1 (could be 2, as that of graviton) possibly

due to electromagnetic ‘interaction’ of  weak  photon-pair signals (as if coming from two positions ( as A1 
&  B1  and  A2  &  B2  in  Fig.1)  of  electrons  in  atomic-orbits).    Gravitation  is  in-fact  electro-magnetic 
phenomenon;  you  may  call  it  -  attraction/repulsion,  electromagnetic-interaction,  space-time  curvature  / 
warping  or  geodesic / light-bending  or  by  whatever-name. 
 
 
The biggest  impact of  new understanding of  gravitation  would be on understanding of  cosmos  / 
universe [26,27]. The known things such as  planet, star, galaxy & black-hole  and mysterious things such 
as dark-matter & dark-energy  may have to be looked-at  in  new-lights from different-perspective.  It may 
be noted that it seems possible [28] to explain some  general-relativity phenomena/tests,  including black-
hole,  without  general-relativity.  The proposed gravitation-theory (as second-order atomic-magnetism) can 
grow & develop subsequently, and could eventually prove to be a step forward for better understanding of 
physics, astro-physics & cosmology.  
 
 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
Gravity  is  the  most  common  force  around  us  but  unfortunately  there  is  no  simple  &  clear 
 
explanation for it. A simple, clear and alternative explanation is proposed in the present paper. Contrast to 
Einstein’s  general-relativity-based  explanation  of  gravity,  the  author’s  explanation  is  based  on  special-
relativity. The new proposed gravito-electro-magnetic  theory propounds that ‘gravitational-force is due to 
second-order relativistic-manifestation of electrostatic-force’  on somewhat similar lines  as magnetism is 
relativistic-effect  of  electricity.    The  proposed  theory  is  well  in  accordance  with  gravity-behavior 
(Newton’s    formula)  having  features  quite  similar  to  its  origin  electrostatic-force  (Coulomb’s    formula), 
and it thus provides a possible link towards unification of the forces.  The new gravitation-theory tells that 
gravitation is in-fact the second-order electro-magnetic phenomenon and the  gravitational-attraction and / 
or  space-time-curvature / geodesic  are  due to the electromagnetic-interaction.

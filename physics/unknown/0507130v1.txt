Abstract

The  understanding  of  the  crystal  collimation  and
extraction experiments performed in the recent decade at
CERN  SPS,  FNAL  Tevatron,  IHEP  U-70  and  RHIC  is
reviewed from the standpoint of Monte Carlo simulations.
The expectations for the LHC - the crystal efficiency and
the requirements to a crystal - are outlined basing on the
same computer model verified in the above experiments.
Finally, we discuss key issues for the future experiments
at  CERN  SPS  and  Tevatron  aiming  to  reach  the  most
efficient channeling and to bring these tests to the future
LHC as close as possible.

INTRODUCTION
The  idea  to  deflect  proton  beams  using  bent  crystals,
originally  proposed  by  E.N.  Tsyganov  in  1976  [1]  and
demonstrated in 1979 in Dubna [2] on proton beams of a
few  GeV  energy  has  received  strong  development.  The
physics related to channeling mechanisms was studied in
details,  first  in  the  early  1980’s  at  St.Petersburg,  Dubna,
CERN,  and  FNAL using  proton  beams  of  1  to  800  GeV
(see  Refs.,  e.g.  in  [3]).  Crystal-assisted  extraction  from
accelerator was demonstrated for the first time in 1984 in
Dubna at beam energies of 4-8 GeV [4].

Crystal  extraction  and  collimation  experiments  have
greatly  progressed  in  recent  decade,  spanning  over  three
decades in energy from 1 GeV [5] through nearly 1 TeV
[6-8]. The theory of crystal extraction is essentially based
on  Monte  Carlo  simulations  [9-13],  as  the  extraction
process  includes  multiple  passes  through  the  crystal,  and
turns in the accelerator, of the beam particles.

Even more importantly, tracking of a particle through a
bent  crystal  lattice  requires  not  only  a  calculation  of  a
particle  dynamics  in  this  nonlinear  field,  but  also  a
generation  of  random  events  of  scattering  on  the  crystal
electrons and nuclei.

To track particles through the curved crystal lattices in
simulation  we  apply  the  approach  with  a  continuous
potential  introduced  by  Lindhard  [14].  In  this  approach
one considers collisions of the incoming particle with the
atomic strings or planes instead of with separate atoms, if
the  particle  is  sufficiently  aligned  with  respect  to  the
crystallographic axis or plane.

 The  typical  step  size  along  the  crystal  length  in
simulation is about 1 micron or a fraction of it, as defined
by the particle dynamics in crystal channel. By every step
the  probabilities  of  scattering  events  on  electrons  and
nuclei  are  computed  depending  on  their  local  densities,
which are functions of coordinates.

This ensures correct orientational dependence of all the
processes  in  crystal  material.  Further  details  on  the
simulation code may be found in Refs.[10-13].

Leaving aside the details of channeling physics, it may
be  useful  to  mention  that  accelerator  physicist  will  find
many familiar things there:
•  Channeled  particle  oscillates 

transverse
nonlinear field of a crystal channel, which is the same
thing as the betatron oscillations in accelerator, but on
a much different scale (the wavelength is 0.1 mm at 1
TeV in silicon crystal). The number of oscillations per
crystal length can be several thousand in practice. The
concepts  of  beam  emittance,  or  particle  action  have
analogue in crystal channeling.

in  a 

•  The  crystal  nuclei  arranged  in  crystallographic
planes  represent  the  "vacuum  chamber  walls".  Any
particle  approached  the  nuclei  is  rapidly  lost  from
channeling  state.  Notice  a  different  scale  again:  the
"vacuum chamber" size is ~2 Angstroms.

•  The  well-channeled  particles  are  confined  far  from
nuclei  (from  "aperture").  They  are  lost  then  only  due
to  scattering  on  electrons.  This 
to
"scattering  on  residual  gas".  This  may  result  in  a
gradual  increase  of  the  particle  amplitude  or  just  a
catastrophic loss in a single scattering event.

is  analogy 

•  Like  the  real  accelerator  lattice  may  suffer  from
errors  of  alignment,  the  lattice  of  real  crystal  may
have  dislocations  too,  causing  an  extra  diffusion  of
particle amplitude or (more likely) a catastrophic loss
[13].

A  detailed  account 

THE SPS EXPERIMENTS
the  crystal  extraction
for 
experiments made at the CERN SPS can be found in this
volume and in refs. [16-18].

Before  these  SPS  studies,  the  theoretical  comparisons
[9] with extraction experiments [4,19] were restricted by
analytical  estimates  only,  which  gave  the  right  order  of
magnitude.  The  computer 
simulations  considered
idealized  models  only  and  predicted  the  extraction
efficiencies  always  in  the  order  of  90-99%  (see  e.g.
[9,20])  while  real  experiments  handled  much  smaller
efficiencies, in the order of 0.01% [4,19].

The  considered-below  theoretical  work  has  been  the
first and rather detailed comparison between the realistic
calculation 
(computer
from 
simulation) and the experiment.

the 

The 

simulation  was  performed 

[21-22]  with
parameters matching those of the SPS experiment. Over
105 protons have been tracked both in the crystal and in
the  accelerator  for  many  subsequent  passes  and  turns
until they were lost either at the aperture or in interaction
with crystal nuclei.

In  the  simulation,  different  assumptions  about  quality
of  the  crystal  surface  were  applied:  one  was  an  ideal
surface,  whereas  the  other  one  assumed  near-surface
irregularities  (a  `septum  width')  of  a  few  µm  due  to  a
miscut angle (between the Si(110) planes and the crystal
face)  200  µrad,  surface  nonflatness  1  µm,  plus  1  µm
thick  amorphous  layer  superposed.  Two  options  were
considered. The first, with impact parameter below 1 µm
and surface parameters as described above, excludes the
possibility  of  channeling  in  the  first  pass  through  the
crystal. This is compared to the second option, in which
the  crystal  surface  is  assumed  perfect,  i.e.,  with  a  zero
septum width.

 Table 1 shows the expected extraction efficiencies for
both  options  from  the  first  simulation  run  and  the
measured  lower  limit  of  extraction  efficiency  [23,24]  at
that early time.

The  efficiency  was  measured  in  the  SPS  experiment
with  the  first  tested  crystals  to  be  10±1.7%  [16].  The
detailed  simulations  [21]  have  shown  that  efficiency
should  be  a  function  of  the  vertical  coordinate  of  the
beam w.r.t. the crystal (for its given shape), and be from
12 to 18% at peak, with imperfect-surface option.

The  simulation  studies  for  a  new  crystal  with  another
geometry (``U-shaped'') were performed prior [21] to the
measurements.  The  model  followed  the  parameters  and
design of this crystal, with the same SPS setting.

Again  the  two  options,  an  imperfect  or  perfect  edge,
have  been  studied.  Figure  1  (borrowed  from  ref.  [25])
shows the angular scan (as narrow as 70 µrad FWHM) of
crystal extraction predicted in simulations [21] for the U-
shaped crystal with edge imperfections in comparison to
the measurements [26], in a rather good agreement. The

peak  efficiency,  ~19%,  was  expected  to  be  slightly
increased with the new crystal. For an ideal crystal and a
parallel  incident  beam,  the  simulation  predicted  a  peak
efficiency  of  ~50%  and  a  very  narrow  angular  scan  (25
µrad FWHM).

Another  SPS  experiment  employed  a  crystal  with  an
amorphous  layer  at  the  edge  to  suppress  the  channeling
in  the  first  passage  of  the  protons  [17].  The  extraction
efficiency with this crystal was indeed of the same order
of magnitude as found without an amorphous layer, thus
confirming  the  theoretical  prediction  [21-22]  that  the
first-pass channeling is suppressed in the SPS crystals.

THE TEVATRON EXPERIMENT
The  Tevatron  extraction  experiment  has  provided
another  check  of  theory  at  a  much  higher  energy  of  900
GeV. A detailed report of predictions for this experiment
from the Monte Carlo simulations was published [27] two
years  before  the  measurements  were  taken  [7].  The
simulation predicted the efficiency of 35% for a realistic
crystal in the Tevatron experiment [27].

During the FNAL test, the halo created by beam-beam
interaction  in  the  periphery  of  the  circulating  beam  was
extracted  from  the  beam  pipe  without  measurable  effect
on  the  background  seen  by  the  experimental  detectors.
The crystal was channeling a 900-GeV proton beam with
an  efficiency  of  ~30%  [7],  showing  a  rather  good
agreement with the theoretical expectation.

Apart  from  observing  the  channeled  particles,  this
experiment  has  measured  also  the  particles  dechanneled
from  the  crystal,  appearing  as  a  tail.    The  number  of
particles in the visible tail was measured 20% of the peak
[7]. A simulation of the experiment predicted 25% [27].

CRYSTAL OPTIMISATION
The  length  of  the  Si  crystals  used  in  the  SPS  and
Tevatron experiments was about optimal to bend protons
with  a  single  pass.  The  efficiency  of  the  multi-pass
extraction  is  defined  by  the  processes  of  channeling,

scattering,  and  nuclear  interaction  in  the  crystal,  which
depend essentially on the crystal length L.

In  order  to  let  the  circulating  particles  encounter  the
crystal  many times and suffer less scattering and nuclear
interactions in the crystal, one has to minimise the crystal
length  down  to  some  limit  set  by  the  physics  of
channeling 
in  a  strongly  bent  crystal  [9,28].  This
optimisation  was  studied  in  Monte  Carlo  simulations  in
general  and  for  the  experiments  at  CERN  SPS  and  the
Tevatron 
the
circulation  of  particle  in  the  accelerator  ring  over  many
turns with multiple encounters with a bent crystal.

THE IHEP EXPERIMENT ON CRYSTAL
COLLIMATION
Monte Carlo study done for the experiment undertaken
at  IHEP  has  predicted  [33]  that  a  crystal  can  be  shorten
quite a bit, down to ~1 mm along the 70-GeV beam in the
extraction  set-up  of  IHEP  U-70.  However,  the  benefits
from  this  optimisation  were  expected  tremendous:  the
crystal  extraction  efficiency  could  be  as  high  as  over
90%. Figure 3 shows both the predicted [33] dependence
of the IHEP crystal extraction efficiency as a function of
the crystal length, and some history of the measurements
since 1997 [5,34-40].

crystal length (cm)

The  optimization  with  the  simulations  was  made  with
the  assumption  of  a  uniform  crystal  curvature  and  is
shown  in  Figure  2  for  the  case  of  SPS  at  120  GeV  [21-
22].  For  a  crystal  with  an  imperfect  surface  there  is
important dependence on length. A new optimum around
L≈0.7  cm  more  than  doubles  the  efficiency  as  compared
to  that  for  the  4  cm  crystal.  Predicting  this  boost  in
efficiency was not a trivial matter: Fig. 2  shows  also  the
absolute  efficiency  from  another  simulation  [32],  which
predicted  just  15%  rise  from  a  change  of  crystal  length
from  4  to  2  cm.  The  same  Figure  shows  the  SPS
measurement with a U-shaped crystal of 4 cm length.

Similarly,  for  the  Tevatron  E853  experiment  it  was
found  that  the  efficiency  of  extraction  could  again  be
increased with the use of a shorter crystal. The efficiency
is  maximal,  near  70%,  in  the  crystal  length  range  from
0.4 to 1.0 cm [27,29].

Much  of  these  dependences,  and  even  the  absolute
figures  of  efficiency  of  multi-pass  extraction,  can  be
understood in the framework of analytical theory crystal
extraction.  We  refer  to  [30,31]  for  discussion  of  it,
together with more simulations repeated for the energies
of 14 and 270 GeV, where new measurements have been
done at the SPS.

Producing  bent  crystal  deflectors  of  required  size  and
curvature is not an easy task, moreover as one takes into
account  that  deflector  has  to  be  placed  in  a  circulating
beam and any extra disturbance to halo particles must be
avoided.  It  took  several  years  in  IHEP  to  approach  the
target set by theory. First IHEP crystal was a kind of strip,
7 mm along the 70 GeV beam, tested at the end of 1997.
Then IHEP turned to analog of U-shaped crystals of SPS;
the  required  deflectors  were  cut  and  polished  in  the
optical  workshop  of  PNPI.  The  decisive  step  was
invention  in  IHEP  of  strip-type  deflectors  (Fig.  4),  very
short – down to ~2 mm along the beam, without straight
parts  and  uniformly  bent.  This  breakthrough  in  bent
crystal technology in IHEP has lead to the dramatic boost
crystal
in 

efficiency.
Figure 4. Strip-type bent crystal invented in IHEP.

  Many  strip  deflectors  were  produced  in  IHEP  from
commercially  available  wafers  of  different  origin.  Now
crystal systems extract 70 GeV protons from IHEP  main
ring  with  efficiency  of  85%  at  intensity  of  1012.  Today,
six locations on the IHEP 70-GeV main ring are equipped
by  crystal  extraction  systems,  serving  mostly  for  routine
applications  rather  than  for  research.The  experimentally
recorded high efficiency followed nicely the prediction as
seen  in  Figure  3.  Compared  to  the  CERN  SPS  and
Tevatron  experiments,  the  efficiency  is  improved  by  a
factor  of  3-8  while  the  crystal  size  along  the  beam  was
reduced by a factor of 15-20 (from 30-40 mm to less than
2 mm).

Experimentally,  the  extraction  efficiency  in  IHEP  was
defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  extracted  beam  intensity  as
measured in the external beam line to all the beam loss in
the  circulating  beam.    A  remarkable feature  of  the  IHEP
extraction is that the record high efficiency of about 85%
is pertained even when the entire beam stored in the ring
is dumped onto the crystal.

particles  deflected  into  the  depth  of  the  collimator,  and
the  nonchanneled  multiply  scattered  particles  peaked  at
the  edge  of  the  collimator.  The  efficiency  figures  as
measured on the extraction set-up were reproduced on the
collimation  set-up  where  the  intensity  of  the  channeled
beam is obtained by integration of the peak in the profile.
 The  collimation  experiment  was  repeated  at  the
injection  plateau  of  the  U-70,  with  1.3  GeV  protons,  on
the same collimation set-up with the same crystal. As one
can  see  in  Figure  5  the  channeling  effect  is  still  quite
profound although the energy was lowered by two orders
of magnitude.

IHEP: Crystal collimation at a ramping energy
In  a  more  recent  IHEP  experiment  the  same  crystal
collimation  set-up  was  tested  in  a  broad  energy  range
made  available  in  the  main  ring  of  U-70  accelerator.
Earlier,  the  experiment  was  performed  at  the  top  energy
flattop, 70 GeV, and at the injection flattop, 1.3 GeV, of
U-70 machine. This time the tests [41] were done at seven
intermediate energies and, importantly, it was not possible
the
to  arrange  a  flattop  for  each  energy.  During 
acceleration  part  of  the  machine  cycle,  on  a  certain
moment corresponding to the energy of the test, the beam
was dumped in a short time onto the crystal.

 Figure  6.  Crystal  collimation  efficiency  (channeled
particles ratio to the entire beam dump) as measured and
as expected. The case of ramping energy in U-70.

These  measurements  are  summarized  in  Figure  6
showing the ratio of  the  channeled  particles  to  the  entire
beam  dump  (the  crystal  collimation  efficiency)  as
measured and as predicted by Monte Carlo simulation.

Figure 7 shows the examples of the radial beam profile
observed  at  the  entry  face  of  the  collimator  with  crystal
working  as  primary  scraper,  at  12  GeV  and  at  45  GeV.
One  can  see  that  the  same  crystal  shows  efficient  work
from injection through the ramping up to the top energy.

The background downstream of the collimator has been
measured  in  IHEP  U70  on  two  locations  with  crystal
working  as  a  primary  scraper.  This  background  plotted
versus  crystal  alignment  in  Figure  8  drops  by  factor  of
two when crystal is aligned. This experiment [42,43] has
been the world first demonstration of crystal collimation.
The factor of two was gained due to channeling with 50%
efficiency.

Figure  5.  The  radial  beam  profile  observed  at  the  entry
face  of  the  collimator  with  crystal  working  as  a  primary
scraper,  at  top  energy  (70  GeV,  top)  and  at  injection
plateau (1.3 GeV, bottom); crystal is the same.

IHEP  has  many  locations  on  the  U-70  ring  where
crystals  are  installed  for  extraction  and  collimation
studies.  Two  of  these  locations  are  dedicated  for  crystal
collimation. In a collimation experiment, a bent crystal is
positioned  upstream  of  a  secondary  collimator  (stainless
steel absorber 4 cm wide, 18 cm high, 250 cm long) and
closer 
the  horizontal  plane.  The
profilemeter records the radial distribution of the particles
incident  on  the  entry  face  of  the  secondary  collimator
(Fig. 5). This distribution includes the peak of channeled

the  beam 

in 

to 

even  higher  radiation  flux  of  70  GeV  protons  [5].  It
received  ~1014  proton  hits  per  spill  of  50  ms,  with  a
repetition  period  of  9.6  s.  Although  it  was  impossible  to
characterise the crystal efficiency in such a short time, the
channeling  properties  after  the  exposure  of  the  crystal
were tested in an external beam line. The deflected beam
observed  with  photo-emulsion  (Figure  9)  was  perfectly
normal,  without  breaks  nor  significant  tails  eventually
produced  by  dechanneled  particles.  This  is  a  good
indication  of  the  absence  of  thermal  and  radiation
damages.

face  of  the  collimator  with  crystal  working  as  primary

 IHEP: Crystal collimation at high intensity

Other  important  issues  to  be  addressed  for  a  practical
application  of  crystal-assisted  extraction  and  collimation
are thermal shock, radiation damage and crystal lifetime.
In typical collimation and extraction  tests  at IHEP U-70,
crystal  channeled  ~1012  protons  (up  to  3·1012  in  some
runs) in a spill of 0.5-1 s duration.

Let  us  illustrate  it  in  the  following  way.  Suppose,  all
the LHC store of 3·1014 protons is dumped on our single
crystal in a matter of 0.2 hour [44-46]. This makes a beam
of  4·1011  proton/s  incident  on  the  crystal  face.  In  IHEP,
this is just routine work for a crystal, practiced every day.
One of the crystals (5 mm long) located upstream of the
U-70  cleaning  area  was  exposed  for  several  minutes  to

Figure  9.  Photograph  of  the  deflected  (left)  and  incident
(right) beams as seen downstream of the crystal. Prior to
the  test,  the  crystal  was  exposed  in  the  ring  to  50-ms
pulses of very intense beam (~1014 proton hits per pulse).
No  damage  of  crystal  was  seen  in  the  test,  after  this
extreme exposure.

Let  us  translate  it  to  the  LHC  case.  One  bunch  of  the
LHC  is  1.1·1011  protons.  The  IHEP  crystal  survives  an
instant  dump  of  1000  bunches  of  the  LHC.  The  LHC
collimation  system  is  required  to  survive  a  hit  of  20
bunches [44-46], so the crystal conforms to it with a great
safety margin. As for the lifetime of a crystal, the CERN
experiment [18] with 450 GeV protons showed that at the
achieved  irradiation  of  5·1020  proton/cm2  the  crystal  lost
only 30% of its deflection efficiency, which means about
100  years  lifetime  in  the  intense  beam  of  NA48
experiment.  One  of  the  IHEP  crystals  served  in  the
vacuum  chamber  of  U-70  over  10  years,  from  1989  to
1999,  delivering  beam  to  particle  physicists,  until  a  new
crystal  replaced  it  (in  order  to  reduce  the  size  of  the
channeled beam).

RHIC EXPERIMENT ON CRYSTAL
COLLIMATION
Another experiment on crystal  collimation has been  in
progress  at  the  Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider  [47-51].
The yellow ring of the RHIC has a bent crystal collimator
of the same type as used in earlier IHEP experiments [34],
5 mm along the beam. By properly aligning the crystal to
the beam halo, particles entering the crystal are deflected
away  from  the  beam  and  intercepted  downstream  in  a
copper  scraper.  The  purpose  of  a  bent  crystal  is  to

improve  the  collimation  efficiency  as  compared  to  a
scraper alone.

Beam  losses  were  recorded  by  the  PIN  diodes,
hodoscope,  and  beam  loss  monitors.  Signals  from  the
RHIC  experiments  were  also  logged  to  monitor  their
background  rates.  Fig.  10  shows  a  typical  angular  scan
from the 2003 RHIC run with gold ions. The same Figure
10  shows  the  predicted  angular  scan.  The  simulation  is
done with the measured machine optics. The two angular
curves,  measured  and  predicted,  are 
in  reasonable
agreement.

Ten-fold improvement is expected from a crystal scraper.

Two cases have been compared:
1.  The Tevatron RUN-II collimation system with all
secondary  collimators  in  design  positions,  but  only
one (D17h) horizontal primary collimator in working
position.    This  primary  collimator  intercepts  large
amplitude  protons  and  protons  with  positive
momentum deviations.

2.  The  same  collimation  scheme,  but  silicon  bent

crystal is used instead of primary collimator.

SIMULATIONS FOR THE LHC
We evaluated the potential effect of crystal collimation
in  the  LHC  using  the  same  computer  model  [10-12]
already  validated  with  the  IHEP,  CERN  SPS,  Tevatron,
and  RHIC  experiments  on  channeling.  Simulations  were
done  in  the  LHC  both  at  the  collision  energy  of  7  TeV
and  at  the  injection  energy  of  450  GeV  for  a  nominal
beam emittance of 3.75 µm (at 1 σ, defined as r.m.s.).  In
the  model,  a  bent  crystal  was  positioned  as  a  primary
element at a horizontal coordinate of 6σ in the halo of the
LHC  beam,  on  one  of  the  locations  presently  chosen  for
amorphous  primary  elements  of  the  LHC  collimation
system design [46]. The LHC lattice functions were taken
corresponding to this position: αx=1.782 and β  x =119 m
in the horizontal plane, and α y = −2.02 and β y =143.6 in
the  vertical  plane.  With  the  previous  parameters  the
horizontal value of σ for the beam is of 0.95 mm.

In  this  study  we  did  not  investigate  the  effect  on
channeling  efficiency  of  the  lattice  functions  at  the
location  of  the  crystal.  Such  an  effect  may  be  rather
important  as  shown  by  recent  RHIC  results  [47-51],
where  a  good  agreement  was  found  between 
the
prediction  (based  on  the  same  model  used  here  for  the
LHC)  and  the  measurement  only  when  the  measured
lattice functions were also taken into account.

Instead,  we  varied  crystal  parameters  such  as  the  size,
bending, alignment angle, material, and the quality of the
surface.  We  observed  the  efficiency  of  channeling,  i.e.,
the  number  of  the  particles  deflected  at  the  full  bending
angle of the crystal, taking into account many turns in the
LHC ring and multiple encounters with the crystal.

Optimal size of the crystal

On the first encounter, the halo particles were assumed
to enter in the crystal face within ≤1 µm from the edge. In
addition,  the  first  1-µm  thick  near-surface  layer  of  the

function  of  crystal  alignment,  for  gold  ions.  Measured
data and simulation (CATCH).

The  efficiency  is  defined  as  maximum  depth  of  the
large  dip  divided  by  the  background  rate.    For  the  2003
RHIC run, the theory predicted the efficiency of 32%, and
averaging  over  the  data  for  this  run  gives  the  measured
efficiency of 26%.
The modest figure of efficiency ~30%, both in theory and
experiment, is attributed to the high angular spread of the
beam that hits the crystal face as set by machine optics. It
is worth to compare this figure of efficiency for gold ions
at  RHIC  to  the  40%  efficiency  achieved  with  similar
crystal for protons at IHEP in 1998 [34]. It is also worth
to notice that the crystal extraction efficiency observed at
CERN SPS with lead ions was 4 to 11% with a long (40
mm)  crystal  of  silicon  [52].  The  RHIC  study  was
demonstration of world first crystal collimation for heavy
ions, with efficiency record high for heavy ions.

TEVATRON SIMULATIONS ON CRYSTAL
COLLIMATION
A  possibility  to  improve  the  Tevatron  beam  halo
scraping using a bent channeling crystal instead of a thin
scattering  target  as  a  primary  collimator  was  studied  at
Fermilab  [53].  In  order  to  evaluate  the  efficiency  of  the
collimation  system,  realistic  simulations  have  been
performed  using  the  CATCH,  STRUCT  and  MARS
Monte Carlo codes.

It  was  shown  that  the  scraping  efficiency  can  be
increased  by  one  order  of  magnitude.  As  a  result,  the
beam-related  backgrounds  in  the  CDF  and  D0  collider
detectors can be reduced by a factor of 7 to 14. Calculated
results on the system performance taking into account the
thickness  of  near-surface  amorphous  layer  of  the  crystal
are presented in Table 2.

IHEP  in  70  GeV  beam.  This  technique  is  available  and
well established.

Choice of the crystal material: low and high Z

The  optics  of  traditional  (amorphous)  collimation  at
accelerators  and  technical  considerations  may  require
primary scrapers of different material (atomic number Z).
As the technique of bent crystal channeling is developed
also with other materials, e.g. germanium (Z=32) [55,56]
and  diamond  (Z=6)  [57,58],  we  continued  our  studies
with other crystals.

the  first  encounter, 

crystal  was  assumed  to  be  amorphous.  This  means  that,
during 
the  particles  were  not
channeled  at  all:  they  were just  scattered  after  traversing
the  full  crystal  length.  This  is  a  rather  conservative
approach. In principle, it is possible to make a crystal face
of a much better accuracy, with less that ~0.01 µm thick
amorphous  layer  (an  oxidized  layer  thickness)  [54].  In
this  case,  most  of  the  incident  halo  particles  would  be
channeled already on the very first encounter.

Fig. 11 shows the computed channeling efficiency as a
function of the crystal length along the LHC beam for two
cases: at flattop (7 TeV) and at injection (450 GeV). Two
bending angles were used. The optimal size of the silicon
crystal  is  about  10  mm  for  0.2-mrad  bending,  5  mm  for
0.1  mrad,  and  3  mm  for  0.05  mrad.  High  efficiency  of
channeling  can  be  obtained  with  the  same  (optimized)
crystal  both  at  7  TeV  and  at  450  GeV.  The  efficiency  is
expected  to  be  90-94%  in  the  case  of  crystal  bending
angle of 0.05-0.1 mrad.

crystal length along the LHC beam, shown for two cases:
at flattop and at injection. The top figure is for the crystal
bending of 0.2 mrad, the bottom one for 0.1 mrad.

Estimation of halo reduction

Different bending angles were examined (finding every
time  the  optimal  size  for  the  crystal)  and  the  channeling
efficiency  computed.  Fig.  12  (top)  shows  the  channeling
efficiency,  F,  as  a  function  of  the  crystal-bending  angle.
Fig.  12  (bottom)  shows  the  same  data  plotted  as  a
“background reduction factor” 1/(1-F), namely  the factor
that  halo  intensity  is  expected  to  be  reduced.  If  all
channeled  particles  were  fully 
the
secondary  collimator,  then  only  non-channeled  particles
should contribute to the background in the accelerator.

crystals.  Crystal  plane  (110)  and  bending  0.1  mrad  were
used  in  each  case.  We  see  that  comparable  efficiencies
can be obtained in all these cases. All these crystals, from
diamond  to  germanium,  can  serve  as  an  LHC  primary
scraper.  Another

possibility  might  be  the  use  of  nanostructured  material
[59-62],  single-wall  and  multi-wall  nanotubes  which
appear to be potentially useful as material for channeling
collimation [63]: see Figure 14.

Crystal surface specifications

The traditional approach to the LHC collimation system
requires that the primary scraper should have flat surface
with the accuracy (non-flatness) of 10 micron. The above
simulations  assumed  crystal  surface  roughness  of  1  µm.
We  have  studied  the  effect  of  surface  roughness  to
channeling  efficiency  at  the  LHC,  modeling  the  near-
surface  non-channeling  layer  (“septum  width”)  as  if  it
was amorphous.

Fig. 16 shows channeling efficiency as a function of the
crystal surface roughness. Even a crystal with a relatively
rough  surface—irregular  by  10  µm—shows  high
efficiency.  The  reason  of  such  behavior  relies  on  the
multi-turn  scheme  for  extraction.  By  making  the  surface
perfect  to  a  better  level  than  1  µm,  the  computed
efficiency will exceed 97%.

Alignment precision

For an efficient operation, the crystal must be oriented
parallel  to  the  envelope  of  the  circulating  beam.  Fig.  15
shows  the  computed  channeling  efficiency  as  a  function
of the crystal orientation angle w.r.t. the incident particles
in the LHC. The orientation curve has FWHM of about 7
µrad  at  top  energy.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  the  same
problem  of  alignment  accuracy 
in  a
conventional  collimation  system.  For  instance,  in  the
the  primary
baseline  collimation  system  for  LHC 
collimator should be aligned with an accuracy of 20 µrad.

POSSIBLE DESIGNS FOR CRYSTAL
SCRAPER: S-TYPE VS O-TYPE
At present, there are two options of what kind of crystal
to  try  for  the  collimation  experiments.  One  option  is  O-
type  crystals  heavily  used  at  IHEP  and  tested  at  RHIC,
another  option  is  Strip-type  crystal  (again,  Strip  types
were  heavily  tested  and  exploited  at  IHEP).  These  two
particular crystals, O-type and S-type, may have about the
same size (5 mm) along the beam and bending angle (e.g.
order  of  0.5  mrad),  however  they  strongly  differ  in
design. The O-type has straight sections (“legs”) while S-
type is bent uniformly  without  straight parts.  Apart  from
the choice from the crystal deflectors already available, it
is important to understand what kind of crystal should be
optimal for future studies.

Here we made a preliminary Monte Carlo simulation to
compare the two crystal designs, O-type and S-type. Both
crystals  had  5  mm  size  along  the  beam  of  900  GeV
protons, and bending of 0.5 mrad. The O-type had straight
parts  1+1  mm;  therefore  only  3  mm  were  bent.  These
parameters are close to what we have in some of the first
crystals prepared for next run of experiments at FNAL.

This is not as detailed simulation as the one published
at  PAC  1999  [53],  because  the  Tevatron  environment
relevant for collimation studies was not considered in full.
However this simulation is sufficient to make predictions
for  the  relative  performance  of  the  two  types  of  crystal.
We assumed that all channeled particles were intercepted
safely  by  an  absorber,  therefore  only  nonchanneled
particles contributed to the background in the Tevatron.

Figure  18  shows,  in  relative  units,  the  background
produced in the Tevatron ring by the two types of crystal
as  a  function  of  crystal  orientation.  The  orientation
angular  range  where  crystal  channels  best  is  about  8
microradian  full  width.  Under  this  orientation,  S-type
crystal  produces  background  lower  than  O-type  crystal
does, by a factor of 1.60±0.05 because of the channeling
with higher efficiency.

Figure 18. Comparison of two designs for crystal scraper.
The  conclusion  of  this  comparative  study:  Strip  type
crystal deflector produces essentially lower background in
Tevatron  than  O-type  crystal  does,  by  a  factor  of
1.60±0.05 according to tentative Monte Carlo simulations
for  crystal  channeling  scraping  in  Tevatron,  for  other
crystal parameters like size and bending being fixed. This
conclusion  agrees  with  the  IHEP  experimental  practice
where  typical  inefficiency  achieved  with  S-type  crystal
has  been  0.15  (i.e.  efficiency  of  85%)  while  O-type
crystals  have  shown  inefficiency  of  0.35-0.60  (i.e.
efficiency  of  40-65%),  i.e.  performance  factor  of  2-4
weaker than that of S-type crystal deflectors.

Tevatron  tests  of  crystal  collimation  will  provide  the
best opportunity for validation of the technique; however,
lots of new information can be gained from the tests in the
SPS.  First  preliminary  Monte  Carlo  studies  for  the  SPS
predict  that  S-type  crystal  could  show  efficiency  as  high
as 95% in collimation experiment if crystal size is chosen
close  to  the  one  used  at  IHEP,  2  mm  along  the  beam.
Here we assumed that crystal collimation tests are run at
270  GeV  in  straight  section  5  of  the  SPS  with  bending
angle of 0.2 mrad.

Simulations  and  experiment  have  identified  strip-type
crystals  as  the  choice  for  collimation  in  the  LHC,  SPS,
Tevatron.  It  is  advised  to  install  a  strip-type  crystal  as  a
scraper for the first collimation tests.

Further  Monte  Carlo  studies  are  advisable  with  a
realistic  account of collimation  settings  and  with  a  study
of other crystal parameters like size and bending angle in
order  to  find  the  best  crystal  option  for  the  planned
experiments  on  crystal  collimation,  and  to  have  detailed
theoretical predictions.

CONCLUSION

in 

Crystal  would  be  very  efficient 

the  LHC
environment.  The  expected  efficiency  figure,  ~90%,  is
already  experimentally  demonstrated  at 
IHEP  and
confirmed  by  simulations  for  the  Tevatron.  This  will
make the LHC 10 times (up to ~40 times) cleaner. Monte
Carlo model successfully predicts the crystal work in the
circulating  beam,  as  demonstrated  recently  in  crystal
collimation experiments at IHEP and RHIC, and in crystal
extraction experiments at up to 900 GeV (the Tevatron).

Crystal  works  efficiently  at  very  high  intensities
(~1012), actually much higher than the LHC requires, with
a  lifetime  of  many  years.  Crystal  survives  the  abnormal
dump of the LHC beam with ~100-fold safety margin (i.e.
survives the instant dump of 1000 LHC bunches or ~1014
protons) as demonstrated experimentally at 70 GeV.

The  same  crystal  scraper  works  efficiently  over  full
energy  range,  from  injection  through  ramping  up  to  top
energy,  as  demonstrated  experimentally  at  IHEP  from  1
through 70 GeV and as seen in simulations for the LHC.
Bent crystals of low-Z and high-Z material are available,
e.g.  diamond  and  germanium,  and  they  demonstrate  the
efficiency similar to that of silicon. Even when a crystal is
misaligned, nonchanneling, it still works as an amorphous
scatterer  so 
its
traditional scheme. This makes it safe.

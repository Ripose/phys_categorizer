We  demonstrate  that  twisting  one  part  of  a  chiral  photonic  structure  about  its  helical  axis 
produces a single circularly polarized localized mode that gives rise to an anomalous crossover in 
propagation.  Up  to  a  crossover  thickness,  this  defect  results  in  a  peak  in  transmission  and 
exponential  scaling  of the linewidth for a circularly polarized wave with the same handedness as 
structure.    Above  the  crossover,  however,  the  linewidth  saturates  and  the  defect  mode  can  be 
excited  only  by  the  oppositely  polarized  wave,  resulting  in  a  peak  in  reflection  instead  of 
transmission.

Localized  modes  produced  by  regular  defects  in  periodic  structures  can  serve  as  low 
threshold  lasers  [1],  low  loss  waveguides,  and  narrow  band  filters  in  an  expanding  array  of 
photonic  devices  [2,  3].  When  defects  are  randomly  positioned,  localized  states  are  produced 
within  the  photonic  band  gap  (PBG)  by  multiple  scattering  [4,  5].  The  photon  dwell  time  at 
resonance with a defect state generally increases exponentially with the structure thickness L. This 
suppresses the lasing threshold in an active structure without the use of external feedback. In 3D 
PBGs,  thresholdless  lasing  has  been  predicted  when  the  band  gap  exceeds  the  emission 
bandwidth  since  emission  can  then  couple  only  to  the  single  defect  mode  [1].  Exceptionally  low 
lasing thresholds have been achieved in vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), in which 
an  amplifying  defect  layer  is  sandwiched  between  stacks  of  layers  with  periodically  alternating 
refractive  index  [6].  A  rich  variety  of  physical  effects  have  been  observed  when  point,  line  and 
planar defects are introduced into periodic dielectric structures by the modifying refractive index or 
thickness  of  isotropic  material.  We  consider  here  the  unusual  photonic  properties  of  a  defect 
created  by  twisting  one  part  of  an  anisotropic  structure  relative  to  the  rest  of  the  sample.  This 
“chiral twist” provides an additional degree of freedom for the design of photonic structures. 

Periodic chiral media appear in nature and can be synthesized as self-organized cholesteric 
liquid crystals (CLCs) [7] or fabricated by a variety of techniques, for example, by glancing-angle 
deposition  on  a  rotating  substrate  [8].  In  CLCs,  the  director,  which  is  the  average  orientation  of 
molecules in a plane, rotates with pitch P as shown in Fig. 1a. A reflection band forms for circularly 
polarized  light  with  the  same  handedness  as  the  structure  itself.  Light  with  opposite  circular 
polarization  is  transmitted  through  the  structure  without  attenuation.  The  edges  of  the  band  are 
defined by two sharp optical modes peaked at a wavelength inside the medium equal to P. These 
correspond  to  circularly  polarized  standing  waves,  in  which  the  electric  field  in  the  bulk  of  the 
sample is aligned along either the ordinary or the extraordinary molecular axes [9]. It was in dye-
doped CLCs that suppression of the density of states in a stop band and lasing in long-lived modes 
at  the  band  edge  were  first  demonstrated  [10].  In  analogy  with  isotropic  periodic  structures,  a 
defect can be produced in a helical structure by adding an isotropic layer in the middle of a CLC 
[11, 12]. The reflection and transmission of radiation with opposite senses of circular polarization 
were  shown  to  be  equal  at  resonance  [12].  In  addition,  a  “chiral  twist”  defect  created  by  rotating 

1 

one part of the sample about its helical axis without separating the two parts was proposed (Fig. 1) 
[11, 13]. Recently, such a spacerless defect has been created in sculptured thin films composed of 
multiple helical columns [13], which have optical properties similar to anisotropic chiral media [14]. 
The peak in transmission was observed for circularly polarized light with the same handedness as 
the  structure  and  related  to  the  phase  shift  between  reflected  waves  from  the  two  parts  of  the 
structure  considered  separately  [13].  . Here we demonstrate that new phenomena emerge when 
we consider the optical interaction with the structure as a whole. 

In  this  Letter,  we  use  scattering  and  transfer  matrix  calculations  to  demonstrate  that  the 
“chiral  twist”  defect  results  in  a  new  type  of  localized  state  with  a  peak  in  reflection  instead  of 
transmission beyond a crossover length Lco . For specificity, we restrict our discussion to samples 
with a chiral twist of 90o in the center of the sample, which creates a photonic defect at a frequency 
in the center of the stop band. More generally, varying the chiral twist angle from 00 to 1800 tunes 
the  defect  frequency  from  the  low  to  the  high  frequency  band  edge.    The  chiral  twist  defect 
introduces a single localized mode into the band gap with a polarization with the same handedness 
as  the  structure.  In  contrast,  an  additional  spacing  introduced  into  isotropic  periodic  structures 
creates a degenerate pair of modes. As a result, the polarization of the chiral twist defect mode is 
independent  of  the  polarization  of  the  exciting  mode,  in  contrast  to  the  polarization  of  the  wave 
inside a 1D isotropic system, which matches that of the exciting radiation. Below Lco, the localized 
mode  is  excited  only  by  a  wave  with  the  same  handedness  as  the  structure  and  exhibits  an 
exponential  spatial  distribution  of  the  energy  density  and  a  peak  in  transmission  at  the  defect 
frequency  (Fig.  2a).  Above  the  crossover,  however,  the  defect  mode  can  be  excited  only  by  the 
oppositely  polarized  wave  and  a  resonant  peak  appears  in  reflection  (Fig.  2b).  Though  the 
polarization  is  transformed  within  the  sample,  the  polarization  of  the  transmitted  and  reflected 
waves is the same as that of the incident wave.  

We  use  scattering  [9]  and  transfer  matrix  [15]  approaches  to  calculate  the  energy  density 
inside  a  right-handed  CLC  sample  and  to  decompose  that  density  into  components  of  different 
circular  polarization  and  propagation  direction.  Identical  results  are  obtained  for  short  structures; 
however, the transfer matrix approach becomes unstable for thick structures for which we use the 
scattering matrix method exclusively. The indices of refraction of the sample are taken to be no = 
1.52 and ne = 1.58, which are typical values for CLCs. The sample is not absorbing and is nearly 
index matched to its surroundings, which has a background index of refraction nb = n ≡ (no + ne)/2 
= 1.55. The sample pitch is P = 400 nm, placing the center of the band gap at a wavelength of λc = 
nP = 620 nm.   

With  a  chiral  twist  of  90o  at  its  physical  center,  a  peak  appears  in  transmission  for  RCP 
radiation  at  λc  for  L  <  Lco  (Fig.  2a).  The  crossover  in  propagation  is  found  in  simulations  of 
transmission  of  right  circularly  polarized  (RCP)  radiation  and  reflection  of  left  circularly  polarized 
(LCP)  radiation  versus  L  at  the  frequency  of  the  localized  state  (Fig.  3).  Figure  2b  shows  the 
disappearance of the peak in transmission for RCP light and the growth of a peak in reflection for 
LCP light beyond Lco. The variation with thickness of transmittance and reflectance at the resonant 
peak  is  displayed  in  Fig.  3.  The crossover thickness, defined as the thickness at which resonant 
transmission and reflection equal 0.5, is seen in the figure to be 41.25 P. The sum of transmission 
of  RCP  light  and  reflection  of  LCP  light  is  shown  as  the  dotted  line  in  Fig.  3  and  seen  to  equal 
unity. The reason for this will be explained below in terms of the coupling of the wave to a localized 

2 

defect  mode.  In  addition,  resonant  transmission  for the right and left circular polarized wave and 
similarly the reflection for both polarizations are equal for any thickness.  

The crossover behavior at the chiral twist defect resonance reflects the anomalous energy 
distribution inside the sample (Fig. 4). The energy densities of the forward propagating wave inside 
the structure for incident RCP and LCP radiation are shown in Fig. 4a for samples with L/P = 10, 
20, 40, 80 and 160. For all samples, the intensity reaches a local maximum at the defect site in the 
middle of the sample. For L << Lco the intensity falls exponentially from the physical center of the 
sample for the incident RCP wave, as would occur for a defect in an isotropic medium, while the 
intensity for incident LCP light is constant throughout the sample. Thus only the incident RCP wave 
is effectively coupled to the localized state in this case. This coupling is the cause of the essentially 
complete  transmission  of  the  RCP  wave.  Since  the  intensity  for  the  incident  RCP  wave  at 
resonance scales exponentially, the photon dwell time within the sample does as well. This leads 
to  an  exponential  rise  in  the  inverse  linewidth  seen  in  Fig. 5. For L 
 Lco, the intensity inside the 
sample  for  an  incident  RCP  wave  is  everywhere  smaller  than  the  intensity  of  the  incident  wave. 
This indicates that the incident RCP wave and the localized mode become decoupled beyond the 
crossover. In contrast, the intensity for the incident LCP wave increases towards the defect site by 
more than three orders of magnitude. This reflects the strong coupling of this wave to the localized 
mode,  which  causes  strong  reflection  and  weak  transmission  of  the  LCP  wave.  Beyond Lco  ,  the 
peak  intensity  inside  the  structure  as  well  as  the  mode  linewidth,  which  is  the  same  in  reflection 
and transmission, saturates as seen in Fig. 5. 

To further analyze the nature of reflection of LCP and transmission of RCP radiation at the 
defect wavelength, we introduce weak absorption into the chiral structure. The results are shown in 
Fig. 6 for L = Lco for an absorption coefficient of 3 cm-1, which is sufficiently small that it only affects 
long-lived photonic modes. It can be seen, that indeed the transmission of the LCP or reflection of 
RCP  waves  are  nearly  equal  to  their  values  of  50%  in  the  absence  of  absorption,  however, 
reflection of LCP and transmission of RCP waves are equally reduced by almost a factor of two. 
This demonstrates that LCP reflection as well as RCP transmission is the result of coupling to the 
long-lived localized state.  

In  order  to  understand  the  nature  of  the  defect  mode,  we  examine  its  polarization  by 
decomposing the wave inside the medium into two circular polarized components for incident LCP 
(Fig.  4b)  and  RCP  (Fig.  4c)  waves  in  a  sample  with  thickness  L  =  160P  ≈  4Lco.  For  each 
polarization of the incident wave, the components propagating in the forward direction are shown.  

For  both  senses  of  circular  polarization  of  the  exciting  radiation,  at  any  sample  thickness, 
the wave near the defect is RCP and the wave intensities for the two directions of propagation are 
equal. Thus, the defect mode is a standing RCP wave near the defect, where most of the energy is 
stored.  Closer  to  the  boundaries,  however,  the  wave  is  in  general  elliptically  polarized  and 
determines  the  polarization  of  the  emission  emerging  from  the  structure  at  the  defect  frequency. 
An incident wave with the same polarization is most efficiently coupled to the localized state. The 
orthogonally polarized wave is completely decoupled from the localized state.  

Let  us  consider  the  coupled  waves  at  various  values  of  L/  Lco.  For  L<<  Lco,  the  incoming 
mode that excites the localized mode is a circularly polarized wave with the same handedness as 
the structure, RCP in our case. The orthogonal wave, LCP, cannot excite the localized state. At L = 

3 

Lco,  the  localized  mode  is  most  efficiently  excited  by  a  linearly  polarized  wave,  whereas  the 
perpendicularly  polarized  wave  does  not  excite  the  localized  state.  For  L  >>  Lco,  the  wave  that 
couples to the localized state has circular polarization opposite to the handedness of the structure 
(LCP  in  our  case),  while  the  orthogonal  wave,  (RCP)  does  not  excite  the  localized  mode.  It  is 
interesting  to  note,  that  for  L  =  Lco,  the  incoming  linearly  polarized  wave  is  split  50/50  in 
reflection/transmission. The polarization, which is coupled to the localized state, is transmitted as 
RCP and reflected as LCP, while the reverse holds for the perpendicularly polarized incident wave. 

As  mentioned  above,  both  the  transmission  of  the  RCP  wave  and  reflection  of  LCP  wave 
can occur only via the excitation of the localized state. The transmission of RCP is therefore the 
coupling  coefficient  between  the  RCP  wave  and  the  localized  state.  The  same  is  true  for  LCP 
radiation. The sum of the corresponding coupling coefficients for the energy is therefore equal to 
unity for any L, as is seen to be unity in Fig. 3 for the sum of the transmission of RCP and reflection 
of LCP. 

In conclusion, we have shown that the chiral twist defect creates a single circularly polarized 
localized  mode  in  contrast  to  a  defect  in  a  binary  layered  medium,  which  produces  two 
orthogonally  polarized  degenerate  localized  modes.  As  a  result,  right  or  left  circularly  polarized 
incoming waves can be decomposed into two orthogonal components one of which is coupled to 
and  another  is  decoupled  from  the  chiral  twist  defect  mode.  The  variation  with  thickness  in  the 
amplitudes of these components results in a crossover in reflection and transmission of circularly 
polarized  waves.  As  a  result,  the  intensity  at  the  site  of  the  localized  mode  saturates  instead  of 
scaling exponentially. Nonetheless, the intensity enhancement can be greater than 103 as in seen 
in  Fig.4b.  This  gives  a  resonant  Q-factor  of  more  than  30,000.  Much  larger  values  of  Q  are 
calculated for structures with lower anisotropy. Achieving such Q-factors in anisotropic media such 
as polymeric CLCs or sculptured thin films would open the way for a variety of active and passive 
integrated optical devices.

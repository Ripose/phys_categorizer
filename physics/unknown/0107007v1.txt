1. Introduction 

 
In the previous works [1-7] the generalization of a Einstein's special theory of relativity on 5-

dimensional extended space with the metric (+ ; -, -, -, -). 

Was constructed the model that unified electromagnetic and gravitational interactions. Models 
equations are formulated in extended space, in that space to usual space (x, y, z) and time t coordinates 
the fifth coordinate s was added.  

This 5-th coordinate has geometrical meaning - interval in space of the Minkowski. Physically 

we connect it with an index of refraction n. It is supposed, that in case of the motion in trajectory with a 
variable n the rest-mass of particles varies. This cause a modification of a gravitational field, created by 
these particles.  

In particular, particles with a zero mass (photons) gain a nonzero mass and begin to be for a 

source of a gravitational field, when move from blank space with n = 1 to the medium with n> 1. 
Offered in [4] unified set of equations is called to describe such processes. 

In this space the mechanics a mass point [1,2,6] and electrodynamics  [2,3] is constructed.  

Lienar-Vihert potentials appropriate to such model also are considered [5]. The properties of solutions, 
adequate them, of an extended set of equations of the Maxwell are analyzed [5].  

The gravitational effects in extended space were also considered: the second space velocity, red 
shift and deflection of starlight, retardation of radar-echo from Mars [7]. It was shown that it is possible 
to receive the same formula (which are received in a general theory of relativity for calculation of 
magnitude of these effects) completely in another way within the framework of a model of extended 
space. For this purpose it was supposed, that the gravitational field create in space some index of 
refraction n. Refraction index n depends on strength of this field. This index of refraction n determines 
motion both photons and massive particles in this space. Then the technique of turns in extended space 
[1-4] was applied. 

Basic outcomes obtained in the previous works are briefly reduced below (also some results in 

electronic versions could be found in [11,13]). 

It was offered such generalization of special theory of relativity, which takes into account 

processes under which a mass of a particle m also would be a variable. As a mass of a particle m we, 
following the recommendations of the review [8], shall understand it a rest-mass, which is a Lorenz 
scalar. For this purpose first of all we shall construct the extension (1 + 3) - dimensional space of the 
Minkowski 
space. 
As the 5-th additional coordinate we will use the interval S that already exists in Minkowski space  

 on (1 + 4) - dimensional space

Now mass m is not any more constant exterior parameter, and becomes variable. All these 5- vectors

  In Minkowski space all particles are separated on two types. At first massive, described by a

current. In a usual electrodynamics this 4-vector of a current, is received from a 4-vector of an energy - 
momentum of a charged particle by division it on a rest-mass of a particle m and multiplication on a 
denseness of a charge. 

Such current is a source of an electromagnetic field, which is described by a 4-vector potential. 

Each component of a current can be considered as a source, which corresponds to one of the 
components of a vector potential. 

In our model particle corresponds the 5-vector of energy - momentum-mass. The fifth 

component of the 5-vector expressed through a rest-mass of a particle. For this reason it is seems 
natural to connect it with a gravitational field. We want to have a current, which simultaneously would 
be a source both for electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Therefore, we multiply this 5-vector on a 
denseness of a charge. In a traditional statement the electromagnetic current is described by a 4-vector 
in space of the Minkowski. It is necessary to transform a 4-vector of a current to a 5-vector. As well as 
in case of a vector of energy - momentum we demand that this vector will be isotropic. Thus,  

we obtain [1,3].

these two fields are integrated in a uniform electromagnetic-gravitational field.

The change of a sign at strengths in a model of extended space is of interest from that point of 
view that in some case under certain conditions force of interaction between particles can change the 
sign too. In particular, the force of an attraction of two massive particles can change to force of 
repulsion. It can be interpreted as manifestation of "antigravitation ". 

 

2. Experimental 
 
In a model of extended space was obtained, that the electromagnetic field could be a source of a 

gravitational field. Besides the driven massive charged particle during deceleration can create around 
itself a gravitational field [1,3,4,5,7].  

For experimental check of this supposition was offered and carried on described below 
experiment. In this experiment the probable origin of a gravitational field during deceleration of the 
relativistic electrons was determined on a modification of oscillations of a massive rotating pendulum.   

The narrow bundle of relativistic electrons from a microthrone 1,  (average power of a bundle 

of 450 W, energy of electrons 30 MeV) was directed on the stopping target (position 2 or 3). The target 
was made from tungsten. The electrons deceleration happened in a position 2 or 3.    

For filing a gravitational field probably originating, during of electron deceleration near to the 

stopping target the special rotating pendulum placed. The pendulum was on vertical pendant 5. Pendant 
was made from a metal string with diameter of 1,8 mm. Pendant length was 85 sm. The pendulum 
could freely rotate on pendant only in a horizontal plane. 

The pendulum consists of easy aluminum bar 4 (length 120 sm). On ends of a bar 4 the massive 

cargoes 6 and 7 of a unmagnetized material of 4 kg each were fixed, in a center the pendulum was 
attached by special strengthening to vertical pendant 5. The pendulum was grounding and additionally 
shielded from different directions by metal grid for a diminution of influence electromagnetic noise. 
The period of free oscillations of a pendulum was about 40 seconds.  

The vertical pendant rigidity of a pendulum could vary by restriction of length of an effectively 

working part of the pendant. Therefore the period of oscillations could continuously be changed in 
limits from 40 about 27 seconds. For a diminution of influence of mechanical noise and the 

 

6 

introductions of additional damping in oscillations of a pendulum were used two liquid dampers 10 and 
11. The dampers 10 and 11 were placed near to the massive cargoes of a pendulum.   

Observation of deviations of a pendulum was carried out at a special screen by the deviation of 

a laser ray reflected from a flat mirror 8 attached to a pendulum. For this purpose the ray from 
continuous He-Ne laser 9 through an optical system 12 (narrowing down an angle of a laser ray) was 
directed on a mirror through the special narrow channel 14 in a ferroconcrete guard 13 around of the 
microthrone. The ray, reflected by a mirror, registered on a screen 16 located on a distance 500 sm 
from a mirror by a video system 15. The video system 15 allowed remotely inspecting oscillations of a 
laser spot and additionally increased a sight angle in 12 times. The diameter of a focussed laser ray on a 
screen 16 was 0,15 mm. The maximum turn angle of a pendulum, inside which reflected ray remained 
in limits of the receiving channel was approximately 2 degrees. Exactitude of fixing of a turn angle by 
all system was 

 degrees.

The pendulum was placed so that one of massive cargoes was near to the stopping target at a 

distance about 20 sm. There was also possibility to move the stopping target from one end of a 
pendulum (position 2) to other end (position 3). It allowed under constant parameters of all not taken 
into account mechanical and electromagnetic noises to change the place of stopping of an electron 
beam. Thus, was changed direction twisting of a pendulum under probable action of an originating 
gravitational radiation. 

 The scheme of experimental installation was placed on Fig.1. 
 
 

3. Calibration measurements 

 
For realization of measurements it was necessary to select optimum parameters of a pendulum 

(mass of cargoes, rigidity of pendant, magnitude of damping of oscillations). On the one hand, it is 
desirable, that during measurements the oscillation frequency of a pendulum was whenever possible 
maximum. On the other hand, the ray reflected from a mirror, should not fall outside the limit 
observations, limited to a diameter of the narrow observant channel in a radiation guard around the 
accelerator. Besides the characteristic operating time of the accelerator under a load usually was 10-15 
minutes. Necessity to accumulate during this time sufficient statistical material poses restriction on a 
period of the oscillations and time of establishing new position of equilibrium of a pendulum in case of 
exterior action. All these requirements were whenever possible taken into account under the choice of 
final parameters of the unit. 

The example of free oscillations of a pendulum in the case of availability of small mechanical 

vibrations from working vacuum pumps is reduced on Fig.2. –  series I (the experiment was carried out 
31.05.2001). On the graph are represented the amplitudes of oscillation on a screen of a laser ray (upper 
and lower series of values) that was reflected from a mirror attached to a pendulum, in dependence 
from number of oscillation and a position of an equilibrium (which was calculated from these 
amplitudes). The exactitude of the definition of a position of a center of a light spot was 0,1 mm. 
The measurements were carried out in this case involved one liquid damper and enlarged rigidity of the 
pendant (by restriction of effectively working pendant length). The period of free oscillations in this 
series was 29 seconds. Establishing of undamped oscillations of a pendulum around of the average 
value of equilibrium of 2,2 mm in this happened. The average amplitude of established oscillations was 
about 0,2   mm.  

For study of the response of a pendulum on a small constant exterior force the ventilation of one 
of massive cargoes by very weak constant stream of an air was carried out. In this case (Fig.2, series II) 
the noticeable variation of oscillations of a pendulum happened already through 3-4 periods. Full 
establishing of the new position of equilibrium happened through 7-8 oscillations.

Both liquid dampers were involved in the other series of calibration measurements (spent 
07.06.2001)  when in addition pendants rigidity was reduced. The period of free oscillations of a 
pendulum in this case was about 40 seconds. 

 Adding the second damper and the diminution of pendant rigidity leads diminishing of 

oscillation frequency of a pendulum under action of an exterior force. On the other hand noticeable 
modification of a position of equilibrium of a pendulum happened already through 1-2 oscillations. 

  Also periodical checking of an independence of an initial average position of equilibrium of a 

pendulum during the time was made. For example in a series of measurements 07.06.2001 were 
conducted not only measurement of a position of an equilibrium prior to the beginning principal series 
of measurements, but also in 2 hours after a termination of principal series.  

 

4. 

 Experimental results and discussion. 

 
For a period from 17.05.2001 to 07.06.2001 7 series of measurements under various operational 

modes of the accelerator and different parameters of a pendulum was conducted. 

Before switching on and after switching off of the electronic bundle the control of position of 

equilibrium of a pendulum was carried out, as well as in case of calibration measurements. In this case 
electrical and the mechanical noises remained constant during all phase of measurements. It was 
achieved with the help of preliminary switching on of all devices, which were used during the 
measurements (water and vacuum pumps, magnetron, deflecting magnets etc.) and their cut-off only 
after a full termination of measurements.  

At Fig.3 there are results of a measurement of an average position of a pendulum in case of 
position of the stopping target in a position 3 (see Fig.1). Series I and III at the graph corresponds to 
control measurements immediately before inclusion and in some minutes after deenergizing an 
electronic bundle. Series II-A and II-B reflects total oscillations of a pendulum during the moment of 
work of the accelerator (about 10 minutes) and some time after deenergizing a bundle. A line of a trend 
(average on 3 points) additionally plotted.  

 

  At Fig.4 there are results of similar experiment, which the only difference was position of the 

stoping target in a position 2. A line of a trend (average on 3 points) also is added. 

From a qualitative comparison of lines of a trend on Fig.3 and Fig.4 it is possible to conclude, 
that there is correlation between inclusion of an electronic bundle and mean deviation of a pendulum 
from a position of equilibrium on a comparison with a control series before and after inclusion. Also 
was found that the direction of a deviation varies in an association with near to which of the cargoes of 
a pendulum the stoping target was.  

The coefficients of variations that describing relative amplitude of a deviation of a pendulum 

V σ=

for a series I, II-A, II-B, III shown on Fig.3 were also calculated. Coefficient of variation V is equal 
under the definition to a ratio of dispersion of some variable to magnitude of average value of this 
variable 
work of the accelerator) is equal 38 %. These exceeds coefficients of variations not only for control 
series I and III (18 and 23 % accordingly), but also exceeds result for a transitional series II-B: 29 % 
(when the electron beam was present only at the beginning of a series).

x)x(

Unfortunately, for the reasons, independent from the author, at present it is difficult to improve 
accuracy of the experiments or to accumulate a large statistical material. So an additional evaluation by 
means of various methods of statistics was conducted, to prove that fact that the fixed deviations 
statistically are authentic. 

  Follow estimations was made: does the distinctions between control and principal series of 

measurements are statistically significant or not?  The results presented below are on the base of 
handlings of the experimental series I, II-A, II-B, III (that were presented on Fig.3.).

2χ see 
The evaluation of reliability of distinctions on a Pirson criterion was made (a criterion 
[10]) between a series I and III on the one hand and series II-A, B on the other hand. The theoretical 
reliability 99 % criterion that these series belong to various general sequences, is equal our case 13,3. 
Coefficient, calculated from the obtained experimental data, " 

2χ " has appeared equal to 30,6. 

Thus by a Pirson criterion the probability of authentic statistical distinction between outcomes 
of control measurements of oscillations of a pendulum on a comparison with phases of an exposure of 
the stoping target by relativistic electrons exceeds 99 %.   

In addition to parametrical significance test of distinction (criterion 

2χ ) between control I, III 

(the electron beam is absent) and basic II-A, II-B (the electron beam is present) series of measurements 
the checking with the help of the nonparametric criterions of distinction was made.  

The serial criterion of difference [10] (based on a probability evaluation of number, necessary 

for authentic difference of a continuous series of values of compared populations) has given 99 % 
reliability of probability of differences.  

The criterion of  Kolmogorov-Smirnov [10] (based on a comparison of series of accumulated 

particulars of two compared empirical populations) has given values lying between levels 95 % and 99 
% of reliability of distinction of a researched experimental series. 

Evaluation of magnitude of a force that can cause such a displacement of the equilibrium 

position of the pendulum also was made. In conducted experiments this deviation did not exceed 1-2 
mm (in terms of registering scale).   The calibration of the pendant gives an upper level of this force, if 
this force is applied on a massive cargo at the end of a pendulum - no more than

610−  N. 

5. Conclusion 
 

A series of experiments on checking of a prediction about the possibility of generation of the 

gravitational field during deceleration of charged massive particles in substance was conducted. 

As a source of charged particles the accelerator of electrons was used. The narrow bundle of 
relativistic electrons (average power of a bundle of 450 W, energy of electrons about 30 MeV) was 
directed on the stoping target from tungsten, where deceleration of the accelerated electrons happened. 
 The measurements have shown emerging of statistically reliable deviation of a rotating 
pendulum (one from which massive cargoes is near to the stoping target) in the moment of deceleration 
of the bundle of relativistic electrons.  

Modification of direction of pendulums deflection in the case of shifting of the stopping target 
from one end of the pendulum to another also was fixed. Estimation of the force that calls a deviation 
of a pendulum has an upper level of

610 −  N.  

Certainly, these first experimental results on checking of predictions which were made on the 

base of a model of extended space, have a preliminary character and require much more substantial 
check, as will be further basis for the future experiments.  

 The author expresses deep gratitude to B.S.Zakirov for the help in realization of the 

experiments on the accelerator.

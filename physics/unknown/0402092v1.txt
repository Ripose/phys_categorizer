Abstract. Measurements of 81Kr/Kr in deep groundwater from 
the  Nubian  Aquifer  (Egypt)  were  performed  by  a  new  laser-
based atom-counting method.  81Kr ages range from ~2×105 to 
~1×106 yr, correlate with 36Cl/Cl ratios, and are consistent with 
lateral  flow  of  groundwater  from  a  recharge  area  near  the 
Uweinat Uplift in SW Egypt. Low δ2H values of the 81Kr-dated 
groundwater reveal a recurrent Atlantic moisture source during 
Pleistocene pluvial periods. These results indicate that the 81Kr 
method  for  dating  old  groundwater  is  robust  and  such 
measurements  can  now  be  applied  to  a  wide  range  of 
hydrologic problems.

The age of groundwater is one of the most elusive geologic 
parameters  to  quantify,  despite  its  crucial  significance  for 
water  resources,  waste  management,  subsurface  reactive 
transport,  and  paleoclimate.  Groundwater  age  is  usually 
defined  as  the  mean  subsurface  residence  time  following 
isolation  from  the  atmosphere,  and  it  can  be  estimated  either 
from  Darcy's  Law  (based  upon  hydraulic  conductivity  and 
gradient) or from measurements of time-dependent abundances 
of  natural  isotopic  tracers.  The  only  available  quantitative 
method  for  dating  old  (5×104–106  yr)  groundwater  involves 
measurements of cosmogenic 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.01×105 yr) [Phillips, 
2000].  The  36Cl  method  is  complicated  by  variations  of  the 
initial  36Cl  activity  and  by  subsurface  input  of  both  stable 
chloride (Cl) and nucleogenic  36Cl [Park et al., 2002]. A more 
optimal  method  for  dating  old  groundwater  is  based  on 
cosmogenic  81Kr  (t1/2  =  2.29×105  yr),  which  has  a  more 
constant  initial  activity  than  36Cl  and  negligible  subsurface 
source  [Loosli  and  Oeschger,  1969],  but  has  been  heretofore 
almost  impossible  to  measure.  Many  groundwater  aquifers do 
not  meet  the  restrictive  criteria  for  application  of  the  36Cl 
method, such as those containing saline waters and brines and 
those  consisting  of  fractured  igneous  and  metamorphic  rocks, 
and  therefore  the  36Cl  method  cannot  be  applied  to  dating 
waters in these aquifers. The capability of making routine 81Kr 
measurements 
in  groundwater  and  other  environmental 
samples (e.g., glacial ice and hydrothermal fluid discharges) is 
needed,  and  in  this  paper  we  present  results  demonstrating  a

significant  advance  toward  the  routine  application  of  this 
method in hydrologic studies. 

81Kr (t1/2 = 2.29×105 yr) is produced in the upper atmosphere 
by  cosmic-ray  induced  spallation  and  neutron  activation  of 
stable Kr isotopes [Loosli and Oeschger, 1969]. As a result of 
its long lifetime and chemical inertness in the atmosphere, 81Kr 
is  expected 
to  have  a  constant  and  well-constrained 
atmospheric source with negligible subsurface sources or sinks 
other  than  radioactive  decay.  The  81Kr/Kr  ratios  of  samples 
extracted  from  air  before  and  after  the  development  of  the 
nuclear  industry  have  been  measured  and  were  found  to  be 
identical  within  the  measurement  error  of  ±8%  [Du  et  al., 
2003].  The  difficulty  in  analyzing  81Kr,  owing  to  its  low 
isotopic  abundance  (81Kr/Kr  ~  10-12)  and  low  solubility  of  Kr 
in water (e.g. one liter of surface water equilibrated with air at 
20°C and 1 atm contains only 7×10-5 cm3 STP of Kr and 2×103 
81Kr atoms), has been its main drawback. Two earlier methods 
of  analyzing  81Kr  were  applied  to  very  old  groundwater.  The 
first  used  resonance  ionization  mass  spectrometry  (RIMS) 
[Thonnard et al., 1987] after two steps of isotope enrichment to 
measure  81Kr  extracted  from  50  kg  of  water  from  the  Milk 
River  Aquifer,  Canada  [Lehmann  et  al.,  1991].  The  second, 
following  extraction  of  Kr 
from  16-ton  samples  of 
groundwater  from  the  Great  Artesian  Basin,  Australia,  used 
accelerator  mass  spectrometry  (AMS)  measurements  of  81Kr 
with a high-end cyclotron [Collon et al., 2000]. Both methods 
were  successful  in  their  proof-of-principle  measurements; 
however, their routine use for 81Kr measurement is hindered by 
the complex enrichment procedures required for RIMS and the 
limited accessibility of large accelerator facilities for AMS. 

tabletop  apparatus, 

Recent  developments  in  the  Atom  Trap  Trace  Analysis 
(ATTA) method, based upon laser manipulation of neutral Kr 
atoms  [Chen  et  al.,  1999;  Du  et  al.,  2003],  have  enabled  the 
analysis  of  81Kr  in  Kr  gas  extracted  directly  from  ~2-ton 
groundwater  samples  using  a 
thus 
providing  a  more  practical  approach  for  dating  very  old 
groundwater.  This  paper  demonstrates  the  first  use  of  ATTA 
for  groundwater  dating  by  the  81Kr  method.  The  Nubian 
Aquifer  of  the  Western  Desert  of  Egypt  [Thorweihe,  1990] 
was selected for study because of its relatively simple geology, 
potential  for  containing  very  old  groundwater,  and  favorable 
characteristics  for  comparison  of  the  81Kr  and  36Cl  methods. 
Until this work, no definitive evidence has been produced for 
either a gradient in groundwater age within the Nubian Aquifer 
or an upper limit to that age. 

Samples  of  Nubian  Aquifer  groundwater  from  wells  in  the 
Western  Desert  of  Egypt  were  measured  for  81Kr,  36Cl,  and 
other  chemical  and  isotopic  constituents  (Fig.  1).  For  81Kr 
dating, dissolved gas was extracted from several tons of water 
at  six  field  sites  using  a  vacuum-stripping  method  [Collon  et 
al.,  2000].  At  the  University  of  Bern,  Kr  was  separated  from 
the  gas  samples  by  molecular  sieve  absorption  and  gas 
chromatographic  methods;  low-level  counting  was  used  to 
confirm  that  the  abundances  of  85Kr  (t1/2  =  10.8  yr)  in  these 
samples  were  indeed  low  (85Kr/Kr  <3%  of  modern  air)  as 
for  old  groundwaters,  verifying  minimal  air 
expected 
contamination  during  sampling;  and,  for  normalization  in 
ATTA  analyses,  a  calibrated  amount  of  85Kr  was  mixed  with 
each Kr sample. The 81Kr/85Kr ratios in the spiked Kr samples

were  then  measured  using  ATTA  at  Argonne  National 
Laboratory [Du et al., 2003]. Chloride concentrations in water 
samples  were  measured  by  ion  chromatography  and  Cl  was 
then  precipitated  as  AgCl  for  measurements  of  36Cl  that  were 
done  by  accelerator  mass  spectrometry  at  the  PRIME  Lab  of 
Purdue University. 

Results  of  the  groundwater  analyses  are  shown  in  Table  1. 
81Kr is expressed in terms of the air-normalized ratio, R/Rair = 
[81Kr/Kr]sample/[81Kr/Kr]air,  where  Rair 
the  modern 
atmospheric  ratio  [81Kr/Kr]air=1.10(±0.05)×10-12  measured  by 
ATTA  [Du  et  al.,  2003].  R/Rair  values  range  from  4.8%  to 
52.6%. Using the simple expression for radioactive decay, and 
the 81Kr decay constant λKr = 3.03(±0.14)×10-6 yr-1, the age tKr 
of a groundwater sample is given by 

is 

 
 
 

  

tKr = –1/λKr ln (R/Rair). 

 

 

     (1) 

The  range  of  ages  thus  derived  is  0.2–1.0×106  yr;  these  are 
apparent ages because the extent of mixing within the sampled 
wells  is  unknown.  Ages  increase  progressively  along  flow 
vectors  predicted  by  numerical  hydrodynamic  models 
[Brinkmann et al., 1987], verifying distant lateral flow of deep 
groundwater  toward  the  northeast  from  a  recharge  area 
southwest of Dakhla. The general correspondence of  81Kr age 
with predicted hydrodynamic age indicates negligible input of 
81Kr  from  subsurface  sources,  in  agreement  with  conclusions 
reached  from  81Kr  measurements  of  groundwater  from  the 
Milk River Aquifer in Canada [Lehmann et al., 1991] and the 
Great  Artesian  Basin  in  Australia  [Collon  et  al.,  2000].  The 
estimated  diffusive  loss  of  81Kr  to  aquitards  was  limited  to 
≤20% for the Great Artesian Basin [Lehmann et al., 2003], and 
is  expected  to  be  even  lower  within  the  Nubian  Aquifer 
because  of  the  lower  porosity  and  smaller  proportion  of 
aquitard formations. 

their  spatial  distribution 

81Kr  ages  increase  progressively  with  distance  to  the  north 
and  east  of  Dakhla; 
indicates 
relatively  high  flow  velocities  (~2  m/yr)  from  Dakhla  toward 
Farafra,  and  low  velocities  (~0.2  m/yr)  from  Dakhla  toward 
Kharga  and  Baris  and  from  Farafra  to  Bahariya.  These 
observations  are  consistent  with  the  areal  distribution  of 
hydraulically conductive sandstone within the aquifer and they 
provide support to some of the existing hydrodynamic models 
[Brinkmann  et  al.,  1987;  Hesse  et  al.,  1987].  Southwestward 
extrapolation  of  the  ~2  m/yr  flow  rate  inferred  from  the 
difference  in  81Kr  ages  for  Dakhla  and  Farafra  is  consistent 
with recharge in the area of the Uweinat Uplift near the Egypt-
Sudan  border  (Fig.  1).  In  this  area,  the  Nubian  sandstone  is 
exposed (or buried beneath sand sheets or dunes) at elevations 
between  200  and  600  m  above  sea  level  over  a  wide  area, 
forming a broad catchment for recharge of the Nubian Aquifer.  
There  is  a  good  correlation between  36Cl/Cl ratios and  81Kr 
ages  (Fig.  2),  in  samples  for  which  both  measurements  were 
made, providing a firm basis for calibrating apparent 36Cl ages 
to an apparent value of [36Cl/Cl]initial for the Nubian Aquifer. A 
best-fit curve through the data using the function 

[36Cl/Cl]measured  
= [36Cl/Cl]seq+ ([36Cl/Cl]initial – [36Cl/Cl]seq) × exp(-tKr×λCl)     (2)

where tKr is the 81Kr-age in years, λCl = 2.30(±0.02)×10-6 yr-1 is 
the  36Cl  decay  constant,  and  [36Cl/Cl]seq  =  8(±3)×10-15  is  the 
secular  equilibrium  in-situ  production  value  for  the  aquifer 
[Phillips, 2000] (assuming constant Cl concentration in water) 
gives  [36Cl/Cl]initial  =  131(±11)×10-15,  which  agrees  well  with 
the  initial  value  of  125(±10)×10-15  estimated  for  the  Great 
Artesian Basin [Love et al., 2000]. 81Kr and  36Cl ages for four 
out  of  six  samples  agree  within  1σ,  but  two  samples  exhibit 
significant  age  discordance.  Sample  El  Zayat  12  (Cl  =  59 
mg/L)  has  a  36Cl  age  of  2.8×105  yr  [Eq.  (2)]  that  is 
significantly younger than its 81Kr age of 3.9×105 yr, indicating 
that  it  may  have  had  a  higher  initial  value  [36Cl/Cl]initial  or  it 
may  have  experienced  subsurface  input  of  nucleogenic  36Cl.  
Sample Sherka-36 (Cl = 95 mg/L) has a 36Cl age of 1.5×106 yr 
[Eq. (2)] that is significantly older than its 81Kr age of 6.8×105 
yr. Here the diagreement may be explained by the addition of 
subsurface  Cl  having  low  36Cl/Cl;  such  Cl  could  be  obtained 
either  by  dissolution  of  Cl-bearing  minerals  or  by  diffusion 
from stagnant, saline pore fluids in aquitards. Stable Cl isotope 
ratios  and  Cl  concentrations  for  these  and  other  Nubian 
Aquifer  groundwater  samples  measured  for  36Cl  support  such 
explanations of the observed  81Kr-36Cl discordance [Patterson, 
2003;  Patterson  et  al.,  2003].  These  results  demonstrate  that 
the integrity of the 36Cl “clock” is vulnerable to additions of Cl 
at  any  point  along  a  flowpath,  whereas,  in  contrast,  the 
potential  for  open-system  behavior  of  Kr  is  minimal  after 
water has reached the water table. 

Stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in the Nubian 
Aquifer  (and  equivalent)  groundwaters  from  across  Saharan 
North  Africa  indicate  a  clearly  defined  continental  isotope 
effect  involving  precipitation  from  air  masses  having  an 
Atlantic  moisture  source;  δ2H  values  decrease  gradually  from 
west  to  east  with  a  geographic  pattern  resembling  that 
observed  in  modern  European  groundwaters  [Sonntag  et  al., 
1978].  In  the  deep  Nubian  Aquifer  samples,  nearly  constant 
δ2H values (from –82 to –79) as a function of  81Kr age reveal 
that  this  Atlantic  moisture  source  was  recurrent  during  all 
major pre-Holocene pluvial periods throughout the past 1×106 
yr. 
isotopic  composition  of  modern 
precipitation in the study area, which mostly delivers moisture 
from  the  Mediterranean,  is  much  less  depleted  in  2H  (δ2H 
ranges from –28 to +14) [IAEA, 1990; Bakri et al., 1992].  

In  contrast, 

the 

Inferences  regarding  the  recharge  history  of  the  Nubian 
Aquifer,  based  on  the  chronology  developed  from  81Kr  and 
36Cl  measurements,  corroborate  available  chronologies  for 
other  terrestrial  and  marine  paleoclimate  indicators  in  the 
region  [Rossignol-Strick,  1983;  Szabo  et  al.,  1989;  Szabo  et 
al.,  1995;  Sultan  et  al.,  1997;  Crombie  et  al.,  1997].  The 
picture revealed by the Nubian Aquifer groundwater archive is 
a  diffuse  reflection  of  the  climate  history  of  Northeast  Africa 
for  the  past  ~1×106  yr.  Investigations  of  other  such  archives 
may  yield  useful  insights  into  the  hydrology  of  large 
groundwater  basins  (both  terrestrial  and  marine),  the  climatic 
evolution  of  continental  interiors,  and  groundwater-climate 
linkages  throughout  the  Late  Quaternary.  This  study  verifies 
that the 81Kr method is a robust tool for dating groundwater up 
to about one million years old. Application of this method to a

wide  range  of  hydrologic  problems,  even  those  involving 
saline  waters  and  brines,  appears  now  to  be  feasible  on  a 
routine basis.

Nubian Aquifer is toward northeast. 
 
 
Fig.  2.  36Cl/Cl  (×10-15)  vs.  81Kr  age  for  Nubian  Aquifer 
groundwater  samples  (±1σ  error  bars),  showing  best-fit 
exponential decay curve of 36Cl. Intercept on y-axis represents 
[36Cl/Cl]initial, the initial  36Cl/Cl ratio of groundwater, which is 
131(±11)×10-15  when  [36Cl/Cl]seq  =  8(±3)×10-15  is assumed for 
the secular equilibrium value of 36Cl/Cl in the sandstone.

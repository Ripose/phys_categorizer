Abstract

Hilbert Spaces of anharmonic oscillators are studied. It is shown that the

eigenvalue structure of all anharmonic oscillators have the same general form

and are dependent on only the ground state energy of the system and a single

function λ(H) of the Hamiltonian H whose form depends explicitly on H. It

is also found that the Hilbert Space of the anharmonic oscillator is unitarily

inequivalent to the Hilbert Space of the simple harmonic oscillator, providing

an explicit example of Haag’s Theorem.

I. INTRODUCTION

In this paper we shall study the general structure of the energy eigenvalues for anhar-

monic oscillators. To be speciﬁc, we are interested in Hamiltonians which have the form,

H = ǫ0

a†a +

+ V (a, a†) ,

1
2 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(1)

where V (a, a†) is the interaction hamiltonian and is a functional of a and a†, the creation

and annihilation operators for the simple harmonic oscillator (SHO). ǫ0 is the SHO energy

scale. When V is a polynomial of degree l

2, the Hamiltonian is easily diagonalizable by

≤

either shifting the operator by a constant (for l = 1) or by a Bogoluibov transformation (for

l = 2). Nonetheless, the results of these analysis have had far reaching applications including

the theory of coherent states, squeezed quantum states [1], and the theories superﬂuidity

and superconductivity [2].

When l > 2 the oscillator is usually called anharmonic with the classical example being

the oscillator with an x4 or (a + a†)4 interaction. This particular anharmonic oscillator

has been extensively studied since the early 1970’s ( [3]-

[6]; see [7] for a review of the

literature), mainly due to the equivalence between the x4 anharmonic oscillator and the φ4

quantum ﬁeld theory in one-dimension.

It was hoped that a detail study of this simpli-

ﬁed system would shed some light on the structure of the φ4 theory in higher dimensions.

Research on this oscillator continues today, mainly because it provides a natural test bed

for diﬀerent approximation schemes such as the strong coupling expansion [8], variational

modiﬁed perturbation theories

[9], lattice methods

[10], etc. Recently, however, Bender

and Bettencourt [11] provided a deeper understanding of the system by using multiple-scale

perturbation theory to show that the frequency of oscillation depends on the energy H of

the state. This was interpreted by them as an operator form of mass renormalization.

The main purpose of this paper is not to present a new method of calculating the energy

eigenvalues of anharmonic oscillators, although we shall end up doing so. Rather, it is

to study the general structure of both the Hilbert Space and the energy eigenvalues of

2

anharmonic oscillators with arbitrary V (a, a†). The approach we shall take follows most

closely the analysis done for the l

2 oscillators. Namely, we shall attempt to construct in

much the same way operators ˜a and ˜a† from a and a† which diagonalizes the hamiltonian.

We ﬁnd that unlike the SHO ˜a and ˜a† obey the commutation relation [˜a, ˜a†] = λ(H) where

in general λ(H) is a functional of H. Its precise form depends on the speciﬁc choice of H

and is a constant only when l

2. The study of any anharmonic oscillator reduces to the

study of operators having this commutation relation along with the determination of λ(H)

≤

≤

and the groundstate energy of the system.

II. GENERAL STRUCTURE

Given a hamiltonian H constructed from a, and a†, we seek solutions of the operator

equation

[˜a, H] = ǫ0λ(H)˜a .

(2)

This is an eigenvalue equation with ˜a being the “eigenoperator” of H and λ(H) its cor-

responding “left eigenvalue”. Unlike a standard eigenvalue equation, however, λ(H) is a

functional of H and the ordering in eq. (2) is important. Eq. (2) does not determine ˜a

exactly since if ˜a satisﬁes eq. (2), then so does g(h)˜a and ˜ag(H) where g is any functional

of H. A normalization for ˜a is needed,

which also diagonalizes the hamiltonian explicitly. ǫ0eg is the ground state energy of the

system and is a constant. This is very similar to the way one determines the Bogoluibov

transformation which diagonalizes the l = 2 hamiltonian H = ǫ0a†a + iǫ1(a2

(a†)2)/2, the

−

main diﬀerence being that λ(H) is now a functional of H. Combining eqs. (2) and (3),

From this, we see that if ˜a is an eigenoperator of H with left eigenvalue λ(H), then so is ˜an,

λ thereby determines the splitting between successive energy levels. Since λ is in general a

functional of H, this splitting depends on the energy of the lower energy state.

If λ(H) is a constant, then from eq. (10) we see that the energy levels of the oscillator are

equally spaced. As we shall show in the next section, this is only possible for l

2, which

≤

is well known. When l > 2, λ(H) is a functional of H and the energy levels are no longer

equally spaced as expected. Notice, however, that both eq. (3) and the communation relation

eq. (4) are invariant under unitary unitary transformations: ˜a

U ˜aU †. As usual, unitary

→

transformations are canonical transformations which preserves the commutation relation.

However, for the SHO, λ = 1, while for an anharmonic oscillator λ(H) is a functional of H.

Since a unitary transformation cannot change the functional form of λ, ˜a and a are unitarily

inequivalent. Consequently, the Hilbert Spaces

Hanhar and

HSHO are unitarily inequivalent

Hilbert Spaces.

If we consider now hamiltonians of the form eq. (1) in which V (a, a†) is controlled by

a single coupling constant ǫ1, we can label the Hilbert Space for each ǫ1 as

Hǫ1. Then
HSHO. Moreover, there cannot be a unitary transformation
If there were, then using a succession of these

Hǫ1 is unitarily inequivalent to
which maps

HSHO and the
two Hilbert Spaces would be unitarily equivalent. Thus for diﬀerent values of ǫ1 the Hilbert

Hǫ1 to

Spaces

Hǫ1 are inequivalent to one another. This is a concrete example of Haag’s Theorem

(see [12]), ﬁrst proved for quantum ﬁeld theories using translational invariance.

Because the spectrum of ˜a†˜a is no longer the non-negative integers, but instead depends

on the energy of the state, ˜a†˜a cannot in general be interpreted as the number operator for

anharmonic oscillators.

From eqs. (3) and (4) the study of anharmonic oscillators reduces to the determination

of the groundstate energy eg and the functional λ(H). This is non-trivial and a method for

doing so will be given in the next section. For now we shall limit ourselves to a qualitative

description of the energy levels by looking at diﬀerent possible behaviors of λ(e).

generically by e, the function λ(e) can be negative for some values of e as long as An > 0 for

all n. If λ(e) is a monotonically increasing function which is unbounded from above, then the

energy spacings between successive energy levels becomes wider as n increases and en grows

rapidly with n. If, on the other hand, λ(e)

constant as e

, then eventually the energy

→

→ ∞

spacing between successive en becomes a constant and we would once again obtain SHO type

of energy levels. Notice also that if we consider eq. (10) as a non-linear transformation of

en generated by λ(e), then the ﬁx point of this transformation λ(λ(e) + e) = λ(e) occurs

precisely when λ(e) goes to a constant. Next, when λ(e) is a monotonically decreasing

function of e that eventually becomes negative for e > ec, then there will be an upper bound

to the energy levels emax. Moreover, with increasing n, en will eventually tend to oscillate

about ec. Finally, if λ becomes imaginary for some eb, then the energy levels will be bounded

by eb and there will only be a ﬁnite number of bound states in the system.

Consider now time evolution. If H does not explicitly depend on t, time evolution is

generated by a unitary transformation [13],

˜a(t) = eitH/¯h˜a(0)e−itH/¯h ,

equation of motion is

˜a(t) = e−iǫ0λ(H)t/¯h˜a(0) ,

which preserves the commutation relation eq. (4). Then the solution to the Heisenberg

(11)

(12)

using eq. (2). The frequency of oscillation of a(t), ǫ0λ(H)/¯h, now depends on the hamiltonian

H. This agrees with the recent result of Bender and Bettencourt [11] and was interpreted

by them as an operator form of mass renormalization. An’s dependence on the energy of

the state is then wavefunction renormalization.

III. SOLUTION OF THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM

˜a and λ(H) can be determined in the following manner. Since H is given in terms of a

and a†, in general ˜a = ˜a(a, a†) which is understood in terms of a power series,

6

˜a =

brs(a†)ras .

∞

Xr,s=0

f (z, ¯z) =

brs ¯zrzs ,

∞

Xr,s=0

By using the commutation relation [a, a†] = 1, we can always reduce any expansion of ˜a to

this form. Eq. (13) is well deﬁned only if the corresponding function

is convergent on R2.

At this point we should also express λ(H) as a power series in H/ǫ0, insert this series and

as well as eq. (13) in eq. (2) and obtain an inﬁnite set of coupled equations between various

brs and the coeﬃcients of the λ expansion. The problem would quickly become intractable,

however. We shall therefore ﬁrst make the following drastic simpliﬁcation. Instead of eq. (2)

we shall solve the simpler equation

where : : denotes normal ordering. Correspondingly, the normalization condition becomes

: [˜a, H] := ǫ0

: λ(H)˜a : +

(cid:18)

1
2 (cid:19)

,

: H := ǫ0 : ˜a†˜a : .

We shall then use the solution of this equation as a guide to determining the solution to

eq. (2). Notice that corrections to the groundstate energy cannot be determined under this

simpliﬁcation and must also be determined separately.

Denoting the solution to eq. (15) by the superscript sc, we ﬁnd that for

b(sc)
rs

: λ(H)(a†)ras :=

r)(a†)ras + s : (a†)ras−1[a, V (a, a†)] : +

Under this normal ordering, solution of eq. (17) is equivalent to solving the diﬀerential

where m is the mass of the particle. We are therefore looking for a semi-classical type of

solution to eq. (3). Indeed, we shall see that the solution of eq. (19) is equivalent to the

WKB result for the energy level splittings of the x4 anharmonic oscillator.

Importantly, eq. (19) has the same symmetry properties as eq. (2). Namely, if f (sc)(z, ¯z)

is a solution to (19), then so is f (sc)(z, ¯z)g(e(sc)) where g(e(sc)) is any function of e(sc). Making

use of this symmetry, we change coordinates to e(sc) and θ =

The importance on the phase in determining the energy levels of the x4 anharmonic oscillator

was shown explicitly in [14].

Reconstruction of ˜a and λ(H) from f (sc)(z, ¯z) is now straightforward, although tedious.

˜a(sc) can be obtained by ﬁrst expanding f (sc) in a power series in z and ¯z and then taking

8

˜a(sc) = f (sc). Since ˜a(sc) was obtained via normal ordering, there is an ordering ambiguity

when we reconstruct ˜a from it. Fundamentally, this ordering ambiguity raises by we replace

z

→

a, ¯z

→

a† in f (sc)(a, a†) since the term ¯zz in the expansion can be replaced by either

a†a or aa† = 1 + a†a. Therefore, to determine ˜a we shall also take ˜a =

f (sc)(a, a†)

,

order
a†a + A where the A’s are constants. They are determined by

o

n

but now we replace ¯zz

→

requiring that the resulting expansions for ˜a and λ(H) satisfy both eq. (2) and eq. (3) (or

equivalently eq. (4)) term by term in the expansion. This will uniquely determine not only

˜a and λ(H), but eg as well.

From eq. (21) we see that for λ(H) to be independent of H, ∂e(sc)/∂

z

2 = k, where k

|

|

is a function of θ only. This limits l

2. Correspondingly, if l > 2, λ(H) is necessarily a

function of H.

In this section we shall apply the above analysis to a non-trivial system: the x4 anhar-

Notice that in both expansions the coeﬃcients of the highest power of energy in each term

are the same. This is a generic feature. Quantum mechanical corrections to λ(sc) results in

only the appearance of lower powers of H/ǫ0 in each term of the expansion. If we then use

V. DISCUSSION

(49)

(50)

(51)

We have shown that the study of anharmonic oscillators is equivalent to the study of

algebras satisfying eqs. (3) and (4); the SHO being a special case of this algebra. In addition,

the Hilbert Space eq. (8) and eigenvalues eq. (10) of these algebras all have the same form.

Analysis of anharmonic oscillators thereby reduces to determining the function λ(H) and the

groundstate eg of the oscillator. This is done by ﬁrst making a semi-classical approximation,

which requires only the evaluation of a single integral, and then using it as a guide to

constructing ˜a and ˜a† in terms of a and a†. This analysis was applied to the x4 interaction

and both the standard second order perturbation result as will as the WKB result were

obtained. Moreover, the recent results of Bender and Bettencourt were also obtained within

this framework.

Unlike the Bogoluibov transformation, the mapping between (˜a, ˜a†) and (a, a†) is non-

linear and cannot be generated by a simple unitary transformation. The two Hilbert Spaces

Hǫ1 and
Hilbert Spaces which are all inequivalent to one another. How these inequivalent Hilbert

HSHO are unitarily inequivalent.

Indeed, each value of ǫ1 determines separate

Spaces, especially their respective groundstates, are related to one another is still an open

question. For now, we note that this result provides a concrete example of Haag’s Theorem

proved ﬁrst for quantum ﬁeld theories in higher dimensions. Based on the results of this

theorem and the generality of our analysis, we expect a similar construction to hold for the

φ4 theory in higher dimensions. Notice, however, that this construction requires a natural

energy scale to deﬁne λ(H). For hamiltonians of the form eq. (1) we have such an energy

scale: ǫ0. For quantum ﬁeld theories, however, no such natural energy scale exists. We

would have to arbitrarily choose an energy scale, which provides a natural introduction of a

high (or low) energy cutoﬀ in the theory.

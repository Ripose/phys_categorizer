Abstract

The CLIC Test Facility  (CTF3) is an intermediate step
to  demonstrate  the  technical  feasibility  of  the  key
concepts  of  the  new  RF  power  source  for  CLIC.  CTF3
will use electron beams with  an  energy  range  adjustable
from  170  MeV  (3.5  A)  to  380 MeV  (with  low  current).
The injector is based on a thermionic gun followed by a
classical bunching system embedded in a long solenoidal
field. As an alternative, an RF photo-injector is also being
studied. The beam dynamics studies on how to reach the
stringent  beam  parameters  at  the  exit  of  the  injector  are
presented.  Simulations  performed  with  the  EGUN  code
showed  that  a  current  of  7  A  can  be  obtained  with  an
emittance 
the  gun  exit.
PARMELA  results  are  presented  and  compared  to  the
requested  beam  performance  at  the  injector  exit.  Sub-
Harmonic  Bunchers  (SHB)  are  foreseen,  to  switch  the
phase  of  the  bunch  trains  by  180  degrees  from  even  to
odd RF buckets. Specific issues of the thermionic gun and
of the SHB with fast phase switch are discussed.

1  INTRODUCTION

The  CTF3  construction  [1]  will  start  in  2001.  It  is
foreseen  in  3  stages  and  the  injector  will  also  have  3
stages  [2]  of  development.  The  first  one  is  called
"Preliminary  stage".  The  injector  is  the  same  as  the
present  one  used  for  LIL  [3]  except  for  the  thermionic
gun. The second one is called "Initial stage". The injector
has  all  new  components  (gun,  bunching,  focusing,  and
matching systems) and should deliver the nominal current
with  all  RF  buckets  filled.  The  third  one  is  called
"Nominal stage". The injector is identical to the previous
one except that SHBs will be added. Even and odd trains
are generated with every other bucket filled. The concepts
of fully-loaded linac and SHB with fast phase switch are
explained in [1]. However the process produces unwanted
satellite  bunches. 
  The  Preliminary  stage  is  being
implemented  [4],  so  this  paper  focuses  on  the  Nominal
stage.

2  BEAM PARAMETERS

2.1  Target parameters at injector exit

The  Preliminary  stage  is  based  on  the  existing  LIL
injector and therefore the beam parameters are  based  on

in  order 

experimental measurements.  For the Nominal stage, the
charge  in  the  satellite  bunches  should  be  as  small  as
possible 
to  get  maximum  RF  generation
efficiency  and  minimum  radiation  problems.  The  bunch
length  should  be  as  short  as  possible  to  get  both  good
beam stability (wake fields) in the following Drive Beam
accelerator, and flexibility for the bunch compressor. The
emittance  should  be  minimised 
(linac  acceptance,
funnelling  process  in  the  combiner  ring,  decelerator
linac). The single-bunch incoherent energy spread should
be  small  in  order  to  minimise  bunch  lengthening  after
bunch  compression.  The  energy  spread  over  the  pulse,
including beam-loading effects, should also be minimum.
This  will  reduce  the  phase  error  after 
the  bunch
compression  and 
the  30  GHz
generation  efficiency.  Table  1  summarises  the  beam
parameters requested at the injector exit for the 3 stages.

 2.2  Layout

 Figure 1 shows the layout for the Nominal stage. After
the  thermionic  gun  (140  kV),  there  are  3  sub-harmonic
bunchers SHB (1.5 GHz), one pre-buncher PB1 (3 GHz),
one buncher B1 (3 GHz, 6-cells TW) and 2 accelerating
structures  S1/S2  (3  GHz,  32-cells  TW).  All  components
between the gun and the injector exit are embedded in a
solenoidal  field  (SNL).  A  matching  section  with  beam
collimation and beam diagnostics is located  between  the
injector and the Drive Beam accelerator.

 3  EGUN SIMULATIONS

For  the  Preliminary  stage,  the  new  thermionic  gun
provides  2  A  at  90  kV.  A  classical  Pierce  gridded  gun,
called  CLIO  [5],  is  proposed.  It  has  a  thermoelectronic
dispenser  cathode  with  an  emitting  surface  of  0.5  cm2,
grid-cathode spacing of 0.15 mm, cathode-anode distance
of  24  mm  and  anode  hole  diameter  of  8 mm.  The
electrode geometry was modelled using the EGUN  code
[6]. The beam radius does not exceed 10 mm between the
anode  and  125  mm  downstream  of  the  anode,  where  a
capacitive  electrode  allows  beam  current  measurements.
The  normalised  emittance 
is  7 mm.mrad,  62  mm
downstream of the cathode. For the  Initial and Nominal
stages, the thermionic gun should provide 7A at 140 kV,
with 150 kV voltage capability. A thermionic gun of the
SLAC-type  is  proposed.  It  has  a  dispenser  cathode  with
an  emitting  surface  of  2  cm2,  cathode-anode  distance  of
45  mm  and  an  electrode  angle  45o.  Figure  2  shows  the
field  lines  and  electron  trajectories.  Simulations  in  a
space-charge-limited 
effect
(1223 oK) give a normalised emittance of 9.5 mm.mrad at
z  =  120  mm  for  a  beam  current  of  7.4  A  (perveance
0.128 2P). However, PARMELA simulations start at  the
anode  exit.  At  this  place,  the  normalised  emittance  is

regime  with 

thermal 

7 mm.mrad. The maximum electric field on the contour is
less than 10 MV/m.

 4  PARMELA SIMULATIONS

4.1  Longitudinal beam dynamics

Extensive  simulations 

[7,8]  are  performed  with
PARMELA  code  at  CERN,  LAL  and  SLAC.  They  start
from the gun exit with an initial normalised emittance of
7 mm.mrad, and 140 keV kinetic energy of the reference
particle.  The  total  number  of  particles  is  6000  over  a
range of 6 S-band cycles. One of the issues is to make the
satellite  charge  (in  a  20o  window)  less  than  5%  of  the
main bunch (in a 20o window). Results are based on beam
dynamics simulations assuming 400 kW RF power for 3
SHBs.  Figure  3  shows  the  phase  spaces  obtained  at  the
injector exit. The bunch length at the end of the injector is
close to 10 ps (fwhh) and about 82% of the particles are
captured in 20o.  Studies are going on based on a cluster
of 3 sub-harmonic bunchers with 3 different frequencies:
1.5  GHz,  3  GHz,  4.5  GHz.  Preliminary  results,  not
discussed  here,  with  a  bunch  length  of  10  ps  and  a
normalised rms emittance of 40 mm.mrad give 3% charge
in the satellites.

stages  (150 kV,  7A)  voltage  and  current  stability  of
@ 0.1%  are  requested  on  the  flat-top.  To  obtain  such
performances, high voltage capacitors will be installed on
a  modified  SLAC-type  gun.  Under  these  conditions  the
stored  energy  will  be  1  kJ  and  a  gun  protection  system
has to be designed.

Concerning  the  SHBs  1.5  GHz,  the  PARMELA
optimisation gives a gradient of 0.4 MV/m over a gap of
4  cm.  This  will  require  a  voltage  of  16 kV.  Based  on
HFSS simulation [9], a power of 124 kW is needed at the
input of each SHB. For 3 SHBs a total power of 372 kW
will be necessary. A fast phase switch of the order of 3 to
4  ns  is  envisaged  for  the  SHBs.  It  could  be  difficult  to
build  a  SHB  with  very  low  Q  (~10)  and  to  provide  a
400 kW power supply at 1.5 GHz with large bandwidth.

4.2  Transverse beam dynamics

To  simulate  the  transverse  beam  dynamics  correctly,
different  mesh  sizes  are  chosen  for  different  regions.
Emittance  variations  are  studied  as  a  function  of  the
strength  and  shape  of  the  solenoidal  magnetic  field.  An
optimum  is  found  for  a  value  of  0.1  T  along  the  2
accelerating structures, with a maximum value of 0.2 T in
the buncher. Table 2 compares the simulation results with
the goal.

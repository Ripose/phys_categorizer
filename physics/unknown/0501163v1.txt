A  Fourier-space  based  design approach  for  the  systematic  control  of  single  and  multiple 

photon  localization  states  in  a  1D  lattice  is  presented.  Resultant  lattices  are  aperiodic  in 

nature, such that lattice periodicity is not a useful optimization parameter to achieve novel 

field  localization  characteristics.  Instead,  direct  control  of  field  localization  comes  via 

control  of  the  Parseval  strength  competition  between  the  different  Fourier  components 

characterizing  a  lattice.  This  is  achieved  via  an  inverse  optimization  algorithm,  tailoring 

the  aperiodic  lattice  Fourier  components  to  match  that  of  a  target  Fourier  distribution 

appropriate for the desired photonic localization properties. We present simulation results 

indicating the performance of a novel aperiodic lattice exhibiting a doubly-resonant high-Q 

characteristic.

The  control  of  electromagnetic  (EM)  wave  localization  using  aperiodic  lattices1  is 

becoming  an  increasingly  important  topic  due  to  potential  applications  in  photonic  integrated 

circuits  (PIC’s)  and  dense  wavelength  division  multiplexing  (DWDM)  systems,  where  high 

transmission and high-resolution outputs are desired. In general, when an EM field is localized in 

a lattice-based cavity, the associated cavity modes exhibit dramatically enhanced transmission in 

comparison  with  other  frequencies  in  the  vicinity,  and  hence  is  the  basis  for  useful  filtering 

functionality.  Fundamentally,  such  localization  phenomena  of  the  EM  wave  can  be  related  to 

Bragg  resonances  which  are  responsible  for  determining  the  photon  propagation  through  a 

lattice. In the simplest case, for a periodic 1D lattice, where the wavelength of the EM radiation 

is  twice  the  optical  lattice  constant  (Λ),  Bragg-resonance  occurs  and  a  bandgap  forms  in  the 

dispersion characteristic, which results in a dip in the spectral transmission characteristic2, but no 

useful photon localization. In order to achieve localized states with a large quality factor, defects 

(missing  or  extra  scattering  sites)  must  be  introduced  into  the  lattice.  This  process,  known  as 

photonic bandgap (PBG) engineering, leads to the appearance of defect (impurity) modes, which 

in  real  space  determine  the  localized  cavities  storing  energy  at  those  defect  sites3,4.  In  finite 

lattices, such modes couple to propagating modes to appear as an enhanced transmission at the 

corresponding resonant frequency5. 

Conventional  PBG  engineering  with  single  or  multiple  defects  is  currently  achieved 

through  a  combination  of  either  a  direct  approach  of  defining  a  quasi-periodic  lattice  in  real 

space  using  constraining  formulae,  such  as  derived  from  Fibonacci,  Cantor  or  Thue-Morse 

series6-8;  coupled-cavity  structures,  proposed  by  Yariv  et  al.9;  or  by  intuition  (accumulated 

design experience) and trial-and-error, such as the high-Q cavity structures reported by Akahane 

et al.10. These methods, which render the lattice aperiodic in the most general sense, indicate that 

aperiodic lattices offer an important platform for the study of EM wave localization. However, 

the  problem  of  finding  the  general  selection  rule  for  choosing  the  relatively  small  number  of 

aperiodic  lattices  with  useful  localization  properties,  from  the  very  large  number  of  possible 

 

2 

aperiodic lattices, is computationally very demanding. In this letter, we present a more efficient 

approach  to  the  identification  of  those  useful  aperiodic  lattices  by  primarily  considering  the 

Fourier-space (k-space) distribution appropriate for the desired EM wave  localization property, 

rather than direct consideration of the real-space lattice.  

The  localization  of  the  EM  wave  is  determined  by  those  wavevectors  of  the  EM  wave 

spectrum,  which  have  their  Bragg  resonating  partner  in  the  Fourier  spectrum  of  the  scattering 

dielectric function. In the general case (i.e. in addition to the conventional periodic case) a Bragg 

resonance  is  the  interaction  of  an  EM  wavevector  k  with  a  Fourier  frequency  Gq  according  to 
2qGk =

.  The  strength  of  the  Bragg  resonance  at  that  frequency  is  controlled  by  the  Fourier 

coefficient  amplitude 

}

given  by  the  Fourier  transform  (FT)  of  the  scattering  dielectric 

{ qGε

function 

}{ pxε

.  Localization  of  the  EM  wave  inside  a  lattice  can  then  be  thought  of  as 

originating  from  the  interaction  of  different  Bragg  resonances,  i.e.,  those  finite  Fourier 

components  characterising  the  lattice.  Multiple  Bragg  resonances  can  therefore  be  used  as  the 

basis  of  controlling  EM  localization  in  a  fashion  not  available  from  a  conventional  periodic 

lattice  (which  exhibits  only  a  single  Bragg  resonance).  The  FT-basis  of  the  localization 

phenomenon,  as  qualitatively  outlined  above,  allows  us  the  additional  benefit  of  exploiting 

digital  signal  processing  techniques11.  For  example,  scattering  sites  of  a  lattice,  doped  with 

defects,  can  be  treated  as  samples  with  a  spatial  frequency  of  less  than  the  Nyquist  frequency 

(i.e.  highest  spatial  frequency  of  the  lattice).  The  Nyquist  frequency  is  denoted  by  the  symbol 

GB,  determined  by  the  reciprocal  of  the  minimum  optical path-length Λ  (optical  path-length  is 
  where  n  represents  refractive  index  distribution  and  l  is  geometric  real-

space) between adjacent scatterers, GB=2π/Λ, and determines the conventional Bragg frequency 

ωB=cGB/2, where c is the vacuum speed of light. A discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of such a 

(purely-real)  distribution  produces  a  symmetric  Fourier  spectrum  about  GB,  where  each 

component  is  responsible  for  a  Bragg  resonance.  Due  to  considerations  of  power  conservation 

 

3 

(i.e.  Parseval’s  theorem)  the  wave  localization  properties  of  the  lattice  are  determined  by  the 

strength competition between those Fourier components.

In this letter, our approach to the design of an aperiodic lattice, with precisely defined wave 

localization properties, is to manipulate the relative strength of the different Fourier components 

(i.e. different Bragg resonances) of the lattice spectrum, (Eq. 1), to match that of a target Fourier 

component  distribution

. In order to manipulate the Fourier components distribution, given by equation 1, the 

real-space lattice periodicity is broken by the introduction of defects in at least one of the sites,

,  and  T  is  the 

analogous  system  temperature.  Therefore  negative  values  for  ∆E  are  always  accepted.  The 

simulated annealing (SA) algorithm requires the system to start at a high temperature (found by 

trial-and-error) to ensure that changes causing an increase in ∆E initially tend to be accepted, so 

avoiding  the  problem  of  becoming  trapped  in  local  minima  during  the  early  stages  of  the 

annealing  process.  As  the  algorithm  iterates,  the  temperature  is  gradually  lowered  for  the  lth 

iteration  according  to  Tl+1  = αTl,  where  α (<1) is  the  cooling  rate.  As  the  system  cools  the 

probability of accepting positive changes in ∆E reduces, and the system tends towards a global 

minimum in cost space. We note that multiple runs of the SA algorithm will tend to find different 

solutions, each of which is close to an overall global optimum in cost-space. However, from a 

practical point of view, the functionality of these solutions tends to be indistinguishable. 

As a design example, we have chosen to modify the spectral response, reported in Foresi et 

al.5,  from  a  single  resonant  high-Q  defect  state  to  a  doubly  resonant  system  with  two  high-Q 

defect states within a wide photonic stop band. In order to achieve this modification in the same 

system,  we need to identify a real-space lattice with two properties; first, the lattice must have 

same  number  (eight)  of  refractive  index  contrast  elements  (e.g.  etched  air  holes  in  a  Si-

waveguide,  i.e.  N=16);  second,  the  length  of  any  defect  is  0.5Λ.  We  have  also  used  silicon-

silicon dioxide as our material system, which provides a sufficiently large contrast (the refractive 

index(cid:0)  difference  ∆n  is  about  2)  so  that  the  optical  wave  is  strongly  confined.  The  waveguide 

cross-section  can  therefore  also  be  made  very  small  (in  this  case  0.5  µm  wide  and  0.26  µm 

thick),  which  is  useful  in  microphotonic  integrated  circuits  at  optical  telecommunication 

wavelengths,  which  require  microscale  optical  elements.  The  k-space  design  was  carried  out 

using  a  software  program  written  in  MATLABTM,  taking  advantage  of  the  efficient  FFT 

 

5 

algorithm,  the  SA  optimisation  took  less  than  1  second  using  a  Pentium-IV  processor  with 

2.8GHz  clock  frequency,  and  512MB  RAM.  The  resulting  device  transmissivities  in  Fig.  1(c) 

was  simulated  using  a  commercial  software  package  (FIMMPROP-3D),  discussed  in  detail 

elsewhere12. 

Fig. 1 (i-a) shows the target DFT spectrum appropriate for a single high-Q resonant state 

within  the  photonic  stop  band,  as  seen  in  Fig.  1  (i-c).  The  Fourier  amplitude  is  zero  at  the 

Nyquist frequency point GB, with the strongest Fourier components existing at the neighbouring 

Fourier  positions,  calculated  as  0.875GB  with  its  symmetric  partner  at  1.125GB.  The  Bragg 

resonances, which originate from these main two Fourier components, interfere to  form a very 

narrow (i.e. high-Q) transmission peak at the conventional Bragg frequency ωB. Fig. 1 (ii) & (iii) 

show  the  DFT  responses  and  the  spectral  transmission  characteristics  of  two  further  lattices 

doped  with  multiple  defects.  The  defects  control  the  strength  of  the  Fourier  component  at  the 

Nyquist  frequency,  and  hence  the  transmissivity  at  the  Bragg-frequency.  In  accordance  with 

Parseval’s theorem, we note that the Fourier component at GB in Fig.1 (ii-a) & (iii-a) strengthens 

at the cost of the component amplitudes of the neighbouring Fourier locations. The strengths of 

the Fourier components (i.e. closely equivalent to reflection coefficients) determine the finesses 

associated with the two resonant peaks, and combined with cavity losses (e.g. lattice absorption, 

diffractive  radiation)  control  the  overall  Q-values  of  the  peaks.  By  inspection,  the  individual 

resonances  in  Fig.1  (ii-c)  &  (iii-c)  have  lower  finesses  (and  hence  Q-values)  than  the  single 

resonant  peak  of  Fig.1  (i-c).  Using  our  understanding  of  the  Parseval  competition  process  for 

systematic control of the strengths of the Fourier components, we now introduce a target DFT 

spectrum

, shown in Fig. 1 (iv-a), appropriate to form two high-Q transmission peaks. 

Fig.  1  (iv-b)  shows  the  resulting  optimal  aperiodic  lattice  solution  for  this  problem.  With  two 

defects  of  size  d=0.5Λ,  the  two  resonating  defect  states  appear  deep  within  the  stop  band  at 

frequencies  0.92ωB  and  1.05ωB  (the  asymmetry  apparent  with  respect  to  the  Bragg  frequency 

being due to the additional lattice dispersion as calculated by FIMMPROP3D). Evident are the 

 

6 

higher  finesses  of  the  peaks  of  Fig.1  (iv-c)  as  compared  with  Fig.1  (ii-c)  &  (iii-c).  We  also 

observe  an  interesting  inverse  relationship  between  the  relative  distance  separating  the  spatial 

defects,  and  the  frequency  distance  between  the  resulting  resonating  peaks.  Such  behaviour  is 

perhaps to be expected due to the reciprocal symmetries between the FT conjugate planes. The 

simulated field intensity patterns in the xy-plane corresponding to these modes and at the Bragg 

frequency  have  been  plotted  in  Fig.  2.  At  the  resonating  frequencies  each  defect  site  acts  as  a 

cavity,  where  the  electromagnetic  wave  is  spatially  localized.  However,  the  evanescent  tail  of 

each  mode  can  overlap  and  couple  to  the  propagating  modes  resulting  in  an  enhanced 

transmission  for  the  corresponding  resonant  frequency.  It  also  can  be  seen  from  Fig  2.,  that 

although the spatial field distributions for both frequencies show maxima at the defect regions, 

there  is  a  node  between  the  defects  for  the  low  frequency  resonance  (Fig  2  (a)).  As  might  be 

expected, the symmetries exhibited by the spatial field distributions at the resonating frequencies 

have a close analogy with the bonding and antibonding wavefunctions well known in solid-state 

physics.  At  the  Bragg  frequency  the  high  intensity  of  light  entering  from  the  left,  but  being 

reflected (i.e., not allowed to propagate) is clearly evident. 

In  conclusion,  we  have  presented  a  comprehensive  Fourier-space  based  design  approach 

for  systematic  control  of  the  number  of  resonant  states  within  a  photonic  stop  band.  We  have 

demonstrated  that  by  manipulating  the  Fourier  components  of  the  lattice  under  the  Parseval 

constraint,  we  are  able  to  achieve  a  desired  localization  charateristic.  As  an  example,  we  have 

presented  a  design  of  a  doubly  resonant  microcavity  structure  using  a  high  refractive  contrast 

material system. The optimum structure is a short and overall aperiodic lattice not known before. 

Such  structures  may  find  a  range  of  useful  spectroscopic  and  PIC  applications,  e.g.  ultrafast 

optical switching and modulation.

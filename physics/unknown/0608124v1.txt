Abstract: 
A  new  sapphire  cryogenic  microwave  resonator  oscillator  has  been  constructed,  which  now 
consistently exhibits the best measured long-term and fractional frequency performance for such 
an oscillator. The single oscillator long-term square root Allan variance is about 2 × 10-17√τ with 
a negative drift of about 2.2 × 10-15/day limited by diurnal environmental temperature cycles for 
integration times above 103 s. The short-term frequency is state-of-the-art (5.6 ×10-16 over 20 s 
of averaging), but highly repeatable and more reliable than previous versions. 
 
Introduction 
Cryogenic  sapphire  oscillators  (CSOs)  have  achieved  the  best  short  term  stabilities  at 
microwave  frequencies  of  any  electromagnetic  oscillator  or  clock  with  a  fractional  instability 
less than a part in 1015. It appears that only with the development of optical clocks could this be 
surpassed.  Such  oscillators  are  essential  for  interrogating  atomic  frequency  standards  at  the 
quantum limit of projection noise,1 otherwise aliasing effects will dominate due to the periodic 
sampling  between  successive  interrogations  of  the  atomic  transition.  For  this  reason,  the 
University of Western Australia (UWA) designed oscillators are now operational at the National 
Measurement  Institute  (NMI)  in  Sydney,2  Laboratoire  national  de  métrologie  et  d'essais  - 
Système  de  Références  Temps-Espace  (LNE-SYRTE)  in  Paris,  the  French  Space  Agency 
(CNES), in Toulouse, at the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ),1 in Tsukuba, and at  
the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) in Tokyo, Japan. 
Other  applications,  which  have  attracted  attention  in  recent  years,  include  generating  stable 
optical  frequencies  from  a  CSO  in  the  laboratory2  and  over  large  distances  with  compensated 
optical  fiber  networks.3  Also,  some  best  tests  of  fundamental  physics  have  been  undertaken, 
such  as  tests  of  Lorentz  invariance,  which  compare  a  CSO  with  a  H-maser,4-6  and  drift  in  the 
fine structure constants, which use fountain clocks with a CSO as the interrogation oscillator7,8 
or by comparing two modes of orthogonal polarization within a CSO9  
 
The increased activity in testing fundamental physics largely due to the advances in technology, 
which are capable of more precise measurement as well of the development of theoretical frame 
works that provide new interpretations.10-18 The first experiments relied on the Earth’s rotation, 
and  the  degraded  performance  at  the  semi-sidereal  and  sidereal  periods  limited  these 
measurements. The most recent (and most sensitive) include two CSOs rotating in the laboratory, 
which allows one to analyze the signal at the most sensitive time scale (20-30 seconds) and dig 
out from the noise any putative signal in a much shorter period of time. This has resulted in the 
measurement  of  the  isotropy  of  the  speed  of  light19  to  about  one  part  in  1016.  However,  the 
experiment used earlier versions of the CSO,20 with a short-term frequency instability a factor of 
40 worse than that of the CSOs reported in this letter. In the future new versions of the CSO will 
be  substituted  into  the  current  rotating  experiment  with  the  possibility  of  improving  our 
sensitivity  by  up  to  a  factor of  40.  In this  letter we  outline  the  design  and  performance  of  the 
new version of our CSO. 
 
Sapphire resonator 
A  highly  stable  CSO  has  been  built  based  on  Crystal  Systems  HEMEX  grade  single-crystal 
sapphire.  The  sapphire  crystal  was  mounted  inside  a  silver-plated  copper  cavity  with  internal 
dimensions of Dc = 80 mm and Lc = 50 mm. See fig. 1. The sapphire was cut with  its crystal 
axes  aligned  within  one  degree  of  the  cylinder  axis  and  a  very  high  degree  of  cylindrical 

geometry. It was optically polished on all surfaces. The crystal dimensions at room temperature 
are; D = 51.00 mm, L = 30.00 mm, with two support spindles of diameter 11.83 mm machined 
on the top and bottom along the cylinder axis. The top support spindle is 8 mm long while the 
bottom  one  is  19  mm  long.  The  latter  was  use  to  securely  support the  sapphire  in  a  clamping 
mechanism held from the bottom. The former was merely used as an aid to cleaning the sapphire. 
That is, the top spindle was used to support the sapphire while it was drying after being removed 
from the cleaning solution. Hence all contact with the main body of the sapphire was avoided.  
 
The  highest  Q-factor  modes  in  the  liquid  helium  cooled  sapphire  resonators  are  Whispering 
Gallery  (WG)  modes21  and  as  a  result  the  WGH16,0,0  mode  at  11.200  GHz  was  chosen  for the 
oscillator.  This  mode  is  quasi-TM  like  where  the  magnetic  energy  is  mostly  aligned 
perpendicular  to  the  cylinder  axis  and  exhibited  a  turning  point  in  the  frequency-temperature 
dependence at 7.2319 K. The sapphire resonator was coupled to two coaxial lines with a primary 
coupling  of  1.06  and  an  unloaded  Q-factor  of  1.5  ×  109  measured  at  the  turnover  point 
temperature.   
 
Loop oscillator performance 
A  loop  oscillator  was  implemented  using  a  high-gain  Endwave  JCA812-5001  microwave 
amplifier as the sustaining stage.20 The microwave amplifier provides about 47 dB of gain and 
hence  about  12  dBm  of  circulating  power  and  about  0  dBm  of  dissipated  power  inside  the 
resonator.  Also  frequency,  temperature,  power  control  and  spurious  AM  index  control  servos 
were implemented. The frequency control was achieved using standard Pound techniques with a 
SRS830  lockin  amplifier  and  two  GT  Microwave  voltage  controlled  phase  shifters,  one  as  a 
modulator of  the  microwave  loop  and the  other  as  an  error  corrector. The  temperature  control 
was achieved with a Lakeshore 340 temperature controller and a CGR-2000 carbon glass sensor. 
The  resonator  temperature  was  controlled  at  the  frequency-temperature  turnover  point  with  a 
control error of less than 100 μK. This was due to the exceptional quality of the particular model 
of temperature controller used. The power and AM index control was implemented using UWA 
custom designed control circuitry. 
 
To test the  oscillator over  long  time  scales  (τ  >103  s)  a  hydrogen  maser  was  used,  while  over 
time  scales  less  than  this  (τ  <103  s)  another  nominally  identical  CSO  was  used.  The  second 
oscillator was built for the atomic frequency standards group at NICT, in Tokyo, and allowed us 
to characterize the short term stability of our oscillator before it was shipped to Japan.  
 
For  short-term  stability  measurements,  the  beat  frequency  of  131.181  kHz  between  the  two 
CSOs was measured with an Agilent 53132A frequency counter referenced to a stable 10 MHz 
signal  from  a  hydrogen-maser.  The  resulting  fractional  frequency  stability  of  the  microwave 
signal  was  calculated  and  is  shown  in  fig.  2  as  the  square  root  Allan  variance  (SRAV)  as  a 
function of integration time, τ. The resulting SRAV is approximately 1.2 × 10-15/√τ between 1 s 
< τ < 4 s then falling to 5.6  × 10-16 at 20 s (a minimum) then climbing to 1.05  × 10-15 at 103 s. 
Between 1 s < τ < 8 s the frequency counter gate time was set 1 s (curve 1) and τ > 8 s a gate 
time of 10 s was selected (curve 2). The frequency stabilities are inferred for a single oscillator 
by  assuming  equal  contributions  to  the  overall  noise  from  each.  Therefore  a  factor  of  √2  has 
been  applied  to  the  short-term  data.  The  beat  signal  was  measured  many  times  and  for 
integration  times  τ  <  103  s  the  results  were  repeatable  within  statistical  errors.    The  oscillator 
short term frequency stability was not limited by the noise floor of the frequency counter shown 
by curve 3. 
 

For  long-term  stability  measurements  our  CSO  was  compared  to  a  synthesized  11.200  GHz 
signal derived  from a Kvarz H-maser by using a step recovery diode. A beat frequency of 386 
kHz was counted with a 10 s gate time and the SRAV calculated. This is shown in curve 4 of fig. 
2  and  is  compared  to the  specification  of  the  maser  manufacturer  (curve  5).  For  τ  >  103  s  we 
start to see the CSO instability over the maser intrinsic noise and therefore a factor of √2 need 
not  be  applied.  At  shorter  integration  times  we  see  the  maser  noise  only.  Judging  form  the 
dependence  of  oscillator  frequency  stability  on  integration  time,  its  long  term  performance  is 
limited by a random walk process. Curve 2 in fig. 2 indicates a SRAV dependence equal to 2 × 
10-17√τ  for  τ  >  103  s.  A  more  detailed  analysis  of  the  servos  and  noise  floors  of  the  control 
systems will be discussed elsewhere. 
 
These results may be compared to those of Chang et al.22 They quote for integration times where 
1 s < τ < 4 s an oscillator SRAV of about 5.4 × 10-16/√τ.  At 32s, a minimum of 2.4 ×10-16 is 
reached  and  for  integration  times  longer  than  100  s,  they  claimed  the  oscillator  frequency 
stability degrades approximately as 3 × 10-17√τ, with drift removed, which was of the order of 
10-13/day. However they only used about half an hour worth of data and showed no repeatability 
of their measurements. Thus no oscillator SRAV was shown above 300 s.  On the other hand our 
results  conclusively  show  that  short  data  segments  do  not  reliably  characterize  the  oscillator 
short term frequency instability. 
 
In our case the drift of oscillator fractional frequency was measured to be 2.2 × 10-15 /day, which 
is  almost two orders of  magnitude  lower than  that  reported  by  Chang  et  al.22  Such  a  low  drift 
rate,  we  believe,  was  achieved  due to the  optimal  geometry  of  the  shielded  sapphire  resonator 
characterized by the absence of any spurious modes in the vicinity of the operating one. This is 
highlighted  in  fig.  2  where  only  curve  2  has  had  drift  removed,  resulting  in  only  a  slight 
improvement  in  SRAV  for  τ  >  2000  s.  Also  the  measurements  were  repeatable  and  large 
amounts of data were collected over many days giving consistent results. See fig. 2 caption for 
details.  A  further  comparison  may  be  made  to  the  long  term  drift  of  the  LPMO  oscillator  of 
Bourgeois et al23 with a published fractional frequency drift of  -6 × 10-14/day and to other CSOs 
built at UWA,24 which have negative drifts of the order of 10-13/day. 
 
In order to evaluate the long term performance we measured our CSO against the synthesized H-
maser signal for long periods of time.  The data sets were taken over 9 days (fig. 3), 18 days (fig. 
4) and 8 days (fig. 5), in chronological order. But because of slight frequency offsets (of about 5 
to  10  mHz)  the  data  sets  cannot  be  represented  on  the  same  plot.  One  known  cause  of  these 
frequency  offsets  is  the  small  changes  in  the  level  of  circulating  power  associated  with  the 
adjustment of a set point of the power control system. Between the data of fig. 3 and fig. 4 the 
200 liter dewar holding the sapphire resonator was refilled with liquid helium, which introduced 
thermal gradients that shifted the frequency slightly.   
 
From  a  linear  fit  to the  data of  fig.  3  we  get  -2.2  ×  10-15/day  fractional  frequency  drift  and  to 
those of fig. 5  we get -3.3 × 10-15/day. The data run of fig. 4 had two disturbances, which we 
believe biases the measurements. Firstly after 5 days one of stoppers on the helium dewar came 
out and the internal  helium pressure dropped. Normally this  is  maintained at some  level  as the 
helium gas recovery  lines have a finite back pressure. The phenomenon  is seen at 4 × 106 s in 
the  fig. 5 plot. Secondly some  heavy objects were dropped near the experiment at about 1.4 × 
106 s but the oscillator slowly recovered. If we measure the drift rate between these two points 
we get -7.7 × 10-15/day.   
 

Clearly the oscillator is dependent on external environmental effects. In all three data sets (figs 3 
-5)  the  diurnal  oscillations  are  clearly  seen  and  mostly  due  to  daily  temperature  variations. 
Analysis of these 24 hours oscillations has shown that the peaks do not exactly occur with a 24 
hour  separation.  This  indicates  that  temperature  is  the  main  driver,  because  the  diurnal 
temperature effects may lag or advance from day to day due to specific weather conditions. To 
improve  the  long  term  stability  of  the  "sapphire  clock",  it  needs  to  be  placed  in  a  temperature 
control environment, which we are currently seeking. 
 
Conclusion 
We  report  on  the  measurement  of  the  long  term  performance  of  an  ultra-stable  cryogenic 
sapphire  oscillator  operating  at  11.200  GHz,  which  to  our  knowledge  is  the  best  measured  to 
date for such an oscillator.  This was achieved with the construction of two nominally identical 
sapphire  oscillators  with  measured  fractional  frequency  instabilities  of 5.6  ×10-16  over  20  s  of 
integration time. It is planned that two of these oscillators will be implemented in an advanced 
Lorentz invariance experiment shortly with a rotation period of 20 s to take advantage of their 
exceptional stability there.

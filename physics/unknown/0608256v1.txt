ABSTRACT: 

We  present  an  optical  experiment  which  permits  to  evaluate  the  information  exchange 

necessary  to  self-induce  cooperatively  a  well-organized  pattern  in  a  randomly  activated 

molecular  assembly.  A  low-power  coherent  beam  carrying  polarization  and  wavelength 

information is used to organize a surface relief grating on a photochromic polymer thin film 

which is photo-activated by a powerful incoherent beam. We demonstrate experimentally that 

less  than  1%  of  the  molecules  possessing  information cooperatively transmit it  to  the entire 

photo-activated polymer film.

Information  exchange  is  mandatory  to  induce  self-organization  [1-3].  Optical  recording  and 

photofabrication techniques use coherent beams and exploit changes in material properties. In 

this respect, surface relief gratings (SRG) in photosensitive organic molecular thin films have 

been  investigated  for  their  potential  applications  to  optoelectronic  devices  [4].  In  the 

conventional  method  to  inscribe  SRGs  in  photoactive  molecular  films,  a  periodic  intensity 

distribution  is  produced  on  the  film  surface  by  the  interference  between  two  optical  beams. 

The  intensity  pattern  induces  isomery,  reorientation  and  molecular  migration  of  the 

photochromic  molecules  inside  the  polymer  film  [5,6],  resulting  in  a  mass  transport  effect. 

Spatial  patterns  may  also  arise  spontaneously  as  a  consequence  of  nonlinear  wave  mixing 

processes in the transverse cross-section of coherent optical beams [7]. As a universal feature, 

these effects  require a coherent excitation which simultaneously  carries the information  and 

excites the degrees of freedom of the system: excitation, rotation and translation in the case of 

photochromic molecules. 

 

We have shown previously that under the assistance of a large-power incoherent beam, the 

information  carried  by  a  low-power  coherent  beam  permits  to  create  a  well  organized  SRG 

[8].  We  seek  in  this  paper  for  some  quantitative  insight  into  the  details  of  the  cognitive 

process: that is the minimum quantity of information exchange leading to self-organization. In 

this  respect,  the  spatial  coherence  of  the  large-power  assistance  beam  is  varied  from  low  to 

high  coherence  and  the  diffraction  efficiency  of  the  self-induced  SRG  is  monitored. 

Information  in  our  experiment  is  given  as  diffraction  characteristics  by  the  coherent  signal 

beam. We show that without coherence, no well defined diffraction pattern is induced. With 

some degree of coherence, a self induced diffraction pattern is formed more or less rapidly. 

We thus get a measurement of the information exchange duration in terms of coherence. We 

also  give  quantitative  insight  into  the  cooperativity  of  the  process.  Practically,  information

given by the signal beam is related to the orientation and pitch of the grating. Our experiments 

show that photoactive molecular films come into a unique cooperative organization although 

most of the individual molecules have a random light-assisted movement. 

 

Our  samples  are  polymer  films  made  from  a  highly  photoactive  azobenzene  derivative 

containing heterocyclic sulfonamide moieties [9]. The polymer (insert in figure 3) was chosen 

in  virtue  of  its  rather  low  glass  transition  temperature  Tg  =  71.1  °C,  leading  to  fast  light 

induced ripple growth. 1 μm-thick films were deposited on glass substrates by spin-coating of 

the polymer with a concentration of 50 mg/ml in a THF solution. The λ = 476.5 nm laser line 

of  a  continuous  argon  ion  laser  was  used  to  excite  the  azo-polymer  close  to  its  absorption 

maximum which peaks at 438 nm. Absorbance at the working wavelength is 1.6. 

A sketch of our experimental set-up is given in figure 1. The laser power is 500 mW. The 

beam width is increased to 5.8 mm by an afocal system made of two lenses. The beam is then 

divided  into  the  two  arms  of  a  Mach-Zehnder  interferometer.  In  the  first  arm,  the  beam  is 

reduced to a width of 2.1 mm by another afocal. This first beam acts as a signal beam. The 

second one acts as a totally incoherent or partially coherent pump beam. Incoherence in the 

second  arm  is  provided  by  focusing  the  laser  beam  through  a  diffuser  (a  frosted  glass 

produced  by  acid  etching  of  a  clear  sheet  glass).  By  adjusting  the  position  of  the  diffusing 

phase screen between the two lenses, we are able to tune the transverse coherence length σμ of 

the  pump  beam.  An  additional  hot-air  gun  is  used  as  a  turbulent  layer  generator  [10]  to 

generate  so-called  pseudo-thermal  light  [11].  It  is  inserted  along  the  beam  path  in  order  to 

obtain total incoherence and depolarization. The diffuser plus turbulence generator introduce 

a random phase which varies much faster than the time constant for grating formation in the 

sample.  The  two  beams  illuminate  the  polymer  sample:  signal  and  pump  beams  overlap 

spatially at the exit of the Mach-Zehnder, with the thinner signal beam fixed at the center of 

3

the pump (Fig.1). Signal beam power is 0.07 mW; its polarization is vertical; diameter is 2.1 

mm. Pump beam intensity is 87 mW; its diameter is 5.8 mm. 

 

In a first experiment, we verified that the surface grating stored can not be the result of one 

beam alone: the signal beam is sent alone onto the sample without the incoherent pump. The 

signal beam intensity is chosen below the intensity threshold for spontaneous SRG induction 

in the film. We get a visual proof of spontaneous SRG induction when first order diffraction 

appears  in  reflection  and  can  be  measured  with  an  appropriate  combination  of  lenses  and 

photodiode. First order diffraction appears with a power threshold of 0.7 mW for the coherent 

signal  beam.  No  self-structuring  of  the  polymer  surface  was  induced  below  this  threshold 

after  one  hour  exposure.  Following  the  same  verification,  when  the  large  87  mW  partially 

coherent  pump  beam  was  sent  alone  onto  the  film  with  only  the  diffuser  placed  behind  the 

first  lens  and  without  the  hot-air  gun,  no  SRG  was  induced  after  an  even  longer  exposure 

When  the  two  overlapping  beams  are  sent  together,  a  SRG  is  induced  after  ½  hour 

exposure without hot air gun, although the maximum incoherence is induced by the diffuser. 

The  diffraction  intensity  growth  shown  in  figure  2  was  measured  for  different  pump  beam 

coherence lengths σμ . Coherence length is measured as the speckle size 

NS /

 [12] in which 

S  is  the  illuminated  surface  and  N  the  number  of  speckle  spots.  Spatial  coherence  length 

varies  practically  from  0  to  1500⋅λ.  Almost  complete  incoherence  and  depolarization 

(

λσμ / ≈  0)  is  obtained  using  the  hot  air  gun.  In  this  condition,  grating  growth  rate  is  the 

time. 

slowest. 

For  all  gratings  stored  for  different  pump  coherent  lengths,  the  height  and  pitch  of  the 

gratings  were  retrieved  using  a  contact-mode  atomic  force  microscope  (AFM).  In  all  cases 

and in every region of the illuminated polymer area, the peak to peak height of the grating is 

4 

Cognitive ability experiment with photosensitive organic molecular thin films 

100  ±  5  nm;  its  mean  pitch  is  Λ  =  888  ±  30  nm;  the  grating  wave-vector  is  parallel  to  the 

polarisation  of  the  signal  beam.  The  pitch  Λ  is  close  to  the  theoretical  value  given  by  first 

order  diffraction  theory  in  the  backward  direction  with  angle  θ  =  32.6°  from  the  normal: 

λ sin2/2=Λ

θ

. The pitch is determined by the conditions of maximum diffraction efficiency 

out  of  the  self-induced  grating,  when  the  second  order  of  diffraction  occurs  along  the  film 

plane. This was initially interpreted as “stimulated Wood’s anomalies” by A.E. Siegman [13] 

for  similar  problems.  Importantly,  the  grating  area  expands  and  covers  all  the  illuminated 

area. The reason is that molecules which move permanently under light reduce their motion 

only if they find a shadowed region [14]. They thus organize collectively, finding the optimal 

way to scatter light out of the polymer film. Information about optimal scattering directions: 

namely  the  SRG  parameters;  is  given  by  the  coherent  beam  characteristics:  incidence  and 

polarization  direction  [8,  15].  The  molecules  which  respond  to  the  coherent  beam  create  a 

diffraction  pattern  and  then  transmit  the  pattern  step  by  step  to  all  their  neighbours. 

Information is exchanged locally via the relief: pits sending more light to the neighboring and 

dips sending less light, thus replicating the pattern. 

The  results  in  figure  2  show  that  partial  coherence  of  the  pump  beam  accelerates  the 

transfer of information from the signal to all the illuminated area in which self-organization 

takes  place.  It  is  illustrated  by  plotting  the  time  threshold  for  self-diffraction  of  the  pump 

beam as a function of pump coherence length (insert in figure 2). This one yields duration of 

the information exchange as a function of coherence. Time threshold is taken as the point at 

which a straight-line fit to the linear portion of the diffraction intensity curve intercepts the X-

axis (fig. 2). The result is fitted with the test function

The learning phenomenon in which the molecules under the incoherent light illumination self-

organize according to the coherent beam characteristics is exemplified by another experiment 

made  with  a  depolarized  pump  beam.  The  coherent  signal  beam  is  stopped  after  about  one 

hour of SRG self-organization and only the incoherent beam is left to irradiate the polymer. 

Figure  3  shows  that  the  diffraction  intensity  continues  to  increase,  proving  that  the  SRG 

continues  to  self-organize.  The  SRG  expands  laterally,  covering  finally  all  the  illuminated 

surface.  It  expands  step  by  step  due  to  the  short  range  interference  of  the  diffracted  waves 

with  the  incident  beam.  After  two  hours  the  hot-air  gun  is  stopped,  increasing  spatial 

coherence  of  the  pump.  We  see  that  the  diffracted  intensity  increases  about  15%  in  a  2 

minutes  time  lag,  without  modification  of  the  evolution  law.  This  shows  that  learning  is 

accelerated  by  coherence  (information  exchange)  without  modification  of  the  information 

content: namely the SRG characteristics. 

 

In another two-beam experiment, we measured the time evolution of the diffraction intensity 

when  polarization  of  one  of  the  beams  is  rotated.  The  hot  air  gun  is  not  used  and  pump 

polarization  is  maintained;  the  pump  is  then  partially  coherent.  In  figure  4,  the  signal  beam 

polarization  is  rotated  after  one  hour  of  interaction  (circles).  Diffraction  which  follows  the 

signal beam polarization [16] then changes direction. When the pump polarization is rotated, 

also after one hour of interaction while keeping the signal beam polarization unchanged (stars 

in fig.4), diffraction continues to increase after about 10 minutes of time lag. This shows that 

leadership  is  acquired  by  the  low  power  coherent  signal  beam,  whatever  its  direction  of 

polarization. The pump permits collective SRG growth but does not participate to the decision 

on the grating characteristics. The time lag after pump polarization rotation corresponds to the 

time needed for leadership to take place. Practically  it corresponds to the time  taken by the 

molecules  moving  under  the  partially  coherent  pump  action  outside  of  the  signal  region  to

receive  the  information  on  the  grating  characteristics  from  the  signal.  This  lag  may  be 

considered as the minimum learning time in our cognitive process. This last experiment gives 

further information on the leadership process within azo-polymers: a cooperative decision on 

the  grating  characteristics  is  driven  by  few  informed  molecules  differing  in  behaviour  from 

the majority which undergoes almost random molecular migration under the incoherent light 

exposure. 

 

by: 

In  order  to  find  a  quantitative  vision  of  the  cooperativity  of  the  process,  we  assume  that 

molecules  undergo  molecular  migration  when  they  are  brought  into  the  cis-state  [14].  The 

coherent signal intensity represents about 0.08% of the incoherent pump power and 13% of 

the  total  surface.  Let  us  consider  a  simplified  trans  -  cis  isomery  model  [17].  When  the 

polymer is illuminated by a depolarized background light superimposed to a linearly polarized 

signal beam with respective intensities Ib and IS, the cis-population in the steady state is given

where Nc is the concentration of molecules in the cis-state under illumination and Nto the total 

number of molecules in the dark; θ is the average angle between the molecular orientation of 

the  trans  molecules  and  the  signal  beam  polarization;  qT  and  qC  are  the  quantum  yields  for 

trans-to-cis and cis-to-trans isomery respectively; σT and σC are the absorption cross sections 

of  the  trans  and  cis  forms  respectively;  K  is  the  thermal  relaxation  rate  from  cis-to-trans. 

Equation  (1)  assumes  implicitly  that  molecules  in  the  cis-state  do  not  have  polarized 

absorption. We have Nto = 7.18·1020 cm-3. We use the following set of parameters: qT = 0.1; 

qC = 0.4 [18] and σT = 0.75·10-16 cm-2; σC = 0.11·10-16 cm-2; K = 0.094 s-1 [9]. We assume θ = 

0 for simplicity. The photon flux is 7.8·1015 cm-2s-1. We get Nc = 2.25·1020 cm-3 molecules for

This  result  illustrates  the  cooperativity  of  the  process:  0.3  %  of  the  molecules  possessing 

decisive information drive gradually the other molecules into a collective decision. Although 

the  detailed  process  is  different,  this  high  level  of  cooperativity  can  be  confronted  to  other 

experiments  borrowed  from  solid-state  physics.  For  example,  a  photoinduced  phase 

transitions from the neutral to ionic (ferroelectric) form in an organic charge-transfer crystal 

was  triggered  by  a  tiny  femtosecond  laser  pulse  [19].  The  phenomenon  is  triggered  by  less 

than  one  excited  molecule  for  about  100  molecules  in  the  crystal.  In  another  example, 

cooperative chiral order was induced in a copolymer containing a minority of chiral units (so-

called  sergeants)  among  achiral  units  (so-called  soldiers)  [20].  The  same  optical  activity  as 

using  a  pure  chiral  homopolymer  is  induced  with  only  15%  of  chiral  units  and  substantial 

activity  appears  with  as  low  as  0.5%  of  chiral  units.  In  our  experiment,  we  chose  a  surface 

ratio of 7.6 between pump and signal beams for demonstration purposes. Changing this ratio 

changes the speed of growth but not the final cognitive effect. We expect a threshold when 

the signal beam size becomes commensurate with the speckle size.  

 

 

In  conclusion  we  have  shown  a  mechanism  of  cooperative  decision  through  the  process  of 

SRG  self-organization.  In  this  work,  information  about  the  SRG  characteristics  (pitch  and 

orientation)  is  given  by  a  tiny  localized  coherent  signal  beam  and  molecular  migration  is 

powered  by  a  strong  incoherent  or  partially  coherent  pump  beam.  The  rate  of  information 

exchange  is  directly  related  to  the  coherence  of  the  pump  beam.  Cooperative  organization 

8 

Cognitive ability experiment with photosensitive organic molecular thin films 

outside  of  the  coherent  beam  area  between  the  informed  molecules  and  the  other 

photoactivated ones is the result of molecular migration which optimizes light scattering away 

from  the  polymer  film.  Learning  is  achieved  step  by  step  with  less  than  1%  of  molecules 

initially informed. Our system should find applications as a paradigm for studies on cognitive 

ability:  various  grating  parameters  can  indeed  be  accessed  by  tuning  the  coherent  beam 

characteristics [15]; this is the initial information from which the system finds optimal light 

scattering  efficiency  conditions.  A  practical  interest  of  surface  structuring  using  incoherent 

light could be that a powerful incoherent light is easier and cheaper to obtain than coherent 

light.

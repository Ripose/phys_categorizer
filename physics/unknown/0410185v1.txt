Abstract. It was reported that  the fuel core was heated up to ~ 0.8 [keV] in the fast ignition experiments

with  cone-guided  targets,  but  they  could  not  theoretically  explain  heating  mechanisms  and  achievement

of  such  high  temperature.  Thus  simulations  should  play  an  important  role  in  estimating  the  scheme

performance, and we must simulate each phenomenon with individual codes and integrate them under the

Fast Ignition Integrated Interconnecting code project. In the previous integrated simulations, fast electrons

generated  by the laser-plasma interaction were too  hot  to efficiently  heat  the core and we got  only 0.096

[keV]  temperature  rise.  Including  the  density  gap  at  the  contact  surface  between  the  cone  tip  and  the

imploded  plasma,  the  period  of  core  heating  became  longer  and  the  core  was  heated  by  0.162  [keV],

~69% higher increment compared with ignoring the density gap effect.

1. Introduction

The  fast  ignition  [1]  approach  to  inertial  fusion  energy  has  been  investigated  by  experiments  with

cone-guided targets [2,3], because this scheme is expected to reduce criteria for fuel burning. Simulations

should  play  an  important  role  in  estimating  the  scheme  performance,  and  the  scientifically  exciting  new

physics of the fast ignition should be self-consistently described in computations. Thus we must consider

1) overall fluid  dynamics of the implosion,  2) laser-plasma interaction and super fast electron generation,

and  3)  super  fast  electron  energy  deposition  within  the  core.  It  is,  however,  impossible  to  simulate  all

phenomena with a single simulation code, and we must simulate each phenomenon with individual codes
and  integrate  them.  Recently,  we  have  started  the  Fast  Ignition  Integrated  Interconnecting  code  (FI3)

project [4]. Under this project, the ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) hydro code (PINOCO: Precision

Integrated implosion Numerical Observation  COde) [5], the collective PIC code  (FISCOF1: Fast  Ignition

Simulation  code  with  COllective  and  Flexible  particles)  [4],  and  the  relativistic  Fokker-Planck  code

(RFP:  Relativistic  Fokker-Planck  code)  [6]  collaborate  each  other  with  data  transfer  via  the  computer

networks.  Since  communication  among  these  codes  is  very  straightforward,  we  have  designed  a

lightweight  TCP/IP  based  protocol,  Distributed  Computing  Collaboration  Protocol  (DCCP),  to  transfer

data between codes [7].

Typical  scenario  in  FI3  project  is  summarized  as  follows:  PINOCO  computes  implosion  dynamics,

including  the  absorption  of  a  main  implosion  laser.  FISCOF1  obtains  density  profile  at  the  maximum

compression  from  PINOCO  and  introduces  plasma  corresponding  to  that  profile  into  the  PIC  system.

Then  an  ultrahigh  intense  ignition  laser  is  launched  into  the  plasma,  and  we  can  simulate  laser-plasma

interactions under realistic conditions in PIC simulations. FISCOF1 computes generation of fast electrons

by  the  laser-plasma  interaction,  and  regularly  sends  distribution  functions  of  fast  electrons  to  RFP.  RFP

receives the distribution functions, and treats them as a time dependent source term of fast electrons. RFP

also gets the bulk plasma profile from PINOCO, and simulates core heating and fusion burning processes

under  obtained  conditions  [8].  Code  integration  diagram  and  physical  quantities  that  should  be

communicated between codes are shown in Fig. 1. Physical quantities  with solid arrows are primary data

that  should  be  transferred  between  codes  as  the  law  of  causality,  and  those  with  shaded  arrows  govern

feedback that can be neglected according to simulation circumstances.

We will present results of integrated fast ignition simulations that  are performed by three codes, and

demonstrate the capability of FI3.

2. Integrated Simulations
2.1 Three Codes

In  PINOCO,  mass,  momentum, electron  energy,  ion  energy,  equation  of states,  laser  ray-trace,  laser

absorption,  radiation  transport,  surface  tracing  and  other  related  equations  are  solved  simultaneously.

Hydrodynamic  is  solved  by  ALE-CIP  method,  which  can  avoid  the  distorted  mesh  problem  or

rezoning/remapping  problem  of  general  Lagrangian  based  implosion  codes.  In  the  energy  equations,

diffusion  equations  that  are  the  Spitzer-Harm  type  thermal  transport  model  are  solved  using  the  implicit

9-point  differencing  with ILUBCG method. For the radiation transport, multi-group diffusion type model

is installed in the code, in which we can use LTE or non-LTE (CRE) opacity database as table lookup.

Traditional  PIC  code  requires  an  unrealistic  huge  number  of  particles  to  simulate  such  parameters

and it  is  impossible  to run  the PIC  code  even  on  such massive  parallel computers.  To reduce  number of

particles  and  computations,  we  have  introduced  collective  particles  into  FISCOF1.  We  statically  get

together  many  particles  into  one  representative  particle  in  overdense  regions  at  an  initial  stage,  and

dynamically  split  a  collective  particle  into  many  normal  ones  under  appropriate  conditions,  but  don't

dynamically unify particles into one.

RFP has been developed for analysis of the fast electron transport and energy deposition processes in

dense core plasma, which was coupled with a Eulerian hydro code to examine core-heating properties. In

this code, a one-fluid  and  two-temperature hydro model  treats cold bulk electrons and  ions,  and the RFP

model  treats  the  fast  electrons  generated  by  the  ignition  laser-plasma  interactions.  In  the  coupled  RFP-

hydro  code,  electromagnetic  fields  generated  by  fast  electrons  are  evaluated  by  combining  generalized

Ohm's law, the Ampere-Maxwell equation, Faraday's law.

2.2 Distributed Computing Collaboration Protocol

We  are  trying  to  perform  simulations  that  need  to  smoothly  coordinate  multiple  codes,  which

communicate each other to integrate  computations.  For large-scale simulations,  execution of each code is

typically  managed  by  NQS  (Networking  Queuing  System;  a  job  management  system  that  assigns  the

queued task to idle processor by turns), and we cannot define when and where these codes are performed.

Meanwhile, in order to communicate between two codes, both codes have to be simultaneously executed,

and the sender code needs to know IP address of the receiver code. Thus communication between them is

not  necessarily  possible  due  to  NQS.  In  order  to  exchange  data  among  codes,  we  therefore  require  a

specific interface that has two features; sender and receiver codes do not have to be executed at the same

time,  and  they  can  be  performed  at  any  machines.  We  have  designed  Distributed  Computing

Collaboration  Protocol  (DCCP)  as  a  system  that  has  the  method  of  non-direct  communication  between

codes. DCCP is a high-level protocol that uses TCP/IP, and builds up a unique communication system for

exchanging  data  only.  Especially  collaboration  of  loosely  coupled  large-scale  simulation  codes  is  the

main object of DCCP.

DCCP has two daemon processes,  which are Arbitrator and Communicator, in the DCCP network  to

realize  the  feature  as  is  described  above.  Communicator  receives  data  that  is  sent  from  codes  or

transferred  from  other  Communicators,  deposits  the  data  in  its  storage,  and  sends  the  data  to  codes  that

request  the  data  or  to  other  Communicators.  In  other  words,  Communicator  actually  performs  data

transmission  instead  of  code  itself.  Arbitrator  administrates  all  Communicators  and  codes  in  the  DCCP

network.  Concretely  speaking,  it  instructs  Communicators  to  transfer  data  to  other  Communicators,  and

controls  communications  between  codes.  In  the  network  with  DCCP,  one  Arbitrator  and  multiple

Communicators  can  exist.  Fig.2  shows  the  configuration  of  DCCP.  Control  Signal  is  used  for

management  of  Communicators and  codes,  and  data  communication  means  transmission  of data  that  are

necessary for collaboration. Communicators use storage to temporarily store data for future usage.

Fig.2 The configuration of the Distributed Computing Collaboration Protocol.

α  version  of  DCCP  was  released  in  March  2004.  In  this  version,  the  communication  between

computers  with  different  Endian  was  invalid.  As  we  supposed  only  a  peer-to-peer  communication  and

implemented  a  send/receive  type  data  transfer,  it  was  very  inconvenient  when  one  code  wanted  to  send

data  to  another  two  codes.  The  send/receive  type  was  also  inconvenient  for  parameter  surveys  with  the

same  input  data  but  different  factors,  because  the  data  was  deleted  from  the  DCCP  system  once  the

receiver  code  got  it  and  the  sender  code  had  to  be  executed  just  the  same  manner.  Thus  we  fixed  the

Endian problem and introduced a multicast type communication, and released β version in Jun 2004. The

DCCP  version  1.0  was  released  in  August  2004  with  improvement  of  robustness,  and  Fortran  calling

interfaces  of  this  version  are  summarized  in  Fig.3.  The  communication  processes  in  the  codes  are  very

easily programmed using just five Fortran subroutines.

2.3 Estimation of Core Heating

In  the first  stage  of  FI3 project,  we  demonstrated  the integrated  simulations  for  a cone-guided  target

and  examined  the  implosion  dynamics,  the  fast  electron  generation,  and  the  core  heating  [9].  Time

evolution of (a) the core heating rate and (b) the ion temperature, which are averaged over the dense core
region (ρ > 50g/cm3), are shown for two different electron profiles,  namely PIC source and mono-energy
beam in Fig. 4. The PIC source is obtained by PIC simulations with the Gaussian pulse of λL = 1.06 [µm],
τFWHM = 300 [fs] and IL = 1020 [W/cm2], and mono-energy beam is the Gaussian profile of E0 = 1 [MeV],
τFWHM  =  300  [fs])  and  peak  intensity  of  3(cid:186)1019  [W/cm2].  The  electron  profile  obtained  from  the  PIC
simulation  for  IL  =  1020  [W/cm2]  has  almost  the  same  intensity  as  the  mono-energy  beam,  however,  the

average energy of electrons is excessively high so that the range is too long because the energy deposition

rate  per  unit path length  of  a fast electron  decreases with the electron  energy. Thus the core  heating rate

obtained in the PIC source case is too small to raise the bulk plasma temperature, and we could not expect

to heat the core in these simulations.

3. Two-Stream Instability and Sloshing Electrons

Main  reason why  we  could  not  get  enough  core heating  with  the PIC  source  was  that  fast  electrons

generated  by  the  laser-plasma  interaction  are  too  hot  to  deposit  their  energy  within  the  core.  Thus  we

must  consider  another  physics  which  are  not  taken  into  account  in  the  previous  integrated  simulations.

The  ignition  laser  can  directly  interact  with  the  cone  wall  like  an  oblique  incident,  and  the  vacuum

heating  could  be  important  [10].  In  addition,  fast  electrons  that  are  generated  at  the  cone  wall  travels

along  the  wall  and  are  accumulated  at  the  cone  tip  [11].  We  cannot  treat  those  effects  by  FISCOF1

because  of  one-dimensionality,  and  are  going  to  replace  it  with  FISCOF2,  which  is  a  two-dimensional

collective  PIC  code  under  development.  We  should  also  take  care  of  recoiling  electrons  that  are  pulled

back  by  the  electrostatic  potential  and  pass  through  the  core  many  times  with  many  chances  to  deposit

their  energy  [12],  and  RFP  should  treat  this  recoiling  effect.  As  a  point  of  electron  transport,  it  was

reported  by  three-dimensional  PIC  simulations  that  the  plasma  return  current  experienced  a  strong

anomalous  resistivity  due  to  diffusive  flow  of  cold  electrons  in  the  magnetic  perturbations,  and  the

resulting  electrostatic  field  leaded  to  an  anomalously  rapid  stopping  of  fast  MeV  electrons  [13].

Anomalous resistivity was also observed by three-dimensional hybrid simulations, and fast electron beam

rapidly lost its energy accompanying with the filamentation [14].

In the cone-guided  target, there is  a  density  gap between the  cone  tip  and the  imploded plasma,  and

fast electrons  must across  this boundary  to reach the  core.  So  we model  this density  gap in  FISCOF1 as

follows:  the  preformed  plasma  is  assumed  to  have  exponential  profile  of  the  scale  length  5  [µm]  with

density from 0.1nc up to 100nc, where nc is the critical density. Behind the preformed plasma, the cone tip

plasma  is  assumed as  10  [µm]  width  and  100nc,  following  the 50  [µm]  compressed  plasma with  2nc  (or

10nc).  Fast  electrons  are  expected  to  lose  their  energy  when  they  across  the  density  gap.  The  energy  of

fast electrons  is  evaluated  at 10  [µm] rear  of the  density  gap.  The temporal  profiles of  the electron  bean

intensity  and  the  time-averaged  electron  energy  distribution  for  compressed  plasma  density  of  100nc

(without the density gap), 10nc and 2nc with the Gaussian laser pulse of λL = 1.06 [µm], τFWHM = 150 [fs]
and IL = 1020 [W/cm2] are shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b), respectively.

Fig.  5  Evaluation  of  fast  electrons.  The  temporal  profiles  of  (a)  the  electron  bean  intensity  and  (b)  the

time-averaged  electron  energy  distribution  for  compressed  plasma  density  of  100nc(gray  solid),

10nc(black solid) and 2nc(black dash).

In  case  of  2nc,  the  electron  beam  intensity  does  not  drop  off  even  after  the  laser  pulse  vanishes,

keeping higher than that of 100nc case in Fig. 5(a), and sub-MeV electrons that are very efficient for core

heating  are  clearly  observed  much  more  in  Fig.  5(b).  When  the  plasmas  with  different  densities  are

adjacent,  the  contact  potential  is  built  up  at  the  boundary.  Amplitude  of  the  contact  potential  could  be

assessed by the current conservation across the boundary as a function of the density ratio and was found

to  be  the  same  order of  the  Boltzmann  potential.  Even  the  density  ratio  is 10,000,  the  amplitude  is  only

eφ/Te ~ 10  and fast electrons can  never be decelerated. Therefore  there would be another  mechanisms to

generate sub-MeV  electrons in case of 2nc.  We estimated the fast electron current in the cone  tip  plasma

in  simulations  and  found  that  it  reached  ~  0.1  x  (100nc  x  vte),  where  vte  is  the  thermal  velocity  of  bulk

electrons  and  the  electron  temperature  is  set  to  10  [keV]  in  simulations.  To  neutralize  this  current,  the

return current in the compressed plasma must be ~ 5 x (2nc x vte). This means that all of bulk electrons in

the compressed plasma must flow with 70% of the light speed  because the ratio of the light speed  to the

electron thermal velocity is 7.15. This stream  of bulk electrons excites a strong two-stream  instability,  in

which  bulk  electrons  are  heated  up.  This  is  one  reason  for  the  obtained  electron  energy  distribution  in

case of 2nc.  If more of the fast currents are injected into the compressed plasma, they cannot be canceled

due  to  limitation  of  the  light  speed,  and  the  electrostatic  field  will  be  built  up.  Thus  a  portion  of  fast

electrons which are generated by the laser-plasma interaction is confined inside the cone tip. On the other

hand,  the return  currents are  accelerated  at the  contact  surface  and injected  into  the cone  tip, and  finally

reflected  at  the  vacuum  boundary.  Therefore  the  cone  tip  is  filled  up  with  sloshing  fast  electrons,  and

some fractions of them are continuously released from there even after the laser pulse is dropped off, and

expected to heat the core more than the case without the density gap.

It  is  noted  that  the  density  ratio  of  the  cone  tip  to  the  compressed  plasma  is  not  important  but  the

density  difference  between  laser-produced  fast  electrons  and  bulk  electrons  of  the  compressed  plasma  is

essential  for  this  mechanism.  When  the  density  of  bulk  electrons  is  sufficiently  higher  than  that  of  fast

electrons, we can not expect this effect. It is also noted that the Weibel instability will occur instead of the

two-stream  instability  in  the  multi-dimensional  PIC  simulations  and  the  same  effect  for  heating  up  the

bulk will be expected.

4. Comparison with Experiments

We have performed FI3 integrated simulations for the recent core heating experiment of cone-guided

targets.  Evaluated  electrons  by  FISCOF1  in  the  previous  section  should  be  used  as  the  time-dependent

momentum  distribution  of  fast  electrons  for  RFP.  But  the  duration  of  the  ignition  laser  assumed  in

FISCOF1  simulations  was  shorter  than  that  of  experimental  values  (500~900fs).  In  addition,  the  laser-

plasma  interaction  at  the  cone  wall  could  not  be  included  in  the  one-dimensional  simulations,  and  the

amount  of  fast  electrons  would  be  underestimation.  Thus,  the  pulse  duration  and  energy  of  the  fast

electron  beam  estimated  above  are  so  smaller  than  those  expected  in  the  experiments.  To  fit  the  source

condition  to  the  experiment,  we  made  artificial  corrections  to  the  fast  electron  profile  obtained  by

FISCOF1.  First,  the  fast  electron  duration  was  stretched  by  a  factor  of  five.  Second,  the  fast  electron

intensity was adjusted so that the amount of “injected source electron energy” is equal to the laser energy

EL (here, we assumed EL = 300J) in the experiments multiplied by the “energy coupling from laser to fast

electron  assessed  by  FISCOF1”.  We  performed  integrated  simulations  with  corrected  fast  electron

profiles, and we estimated the core heating properties. The temporal profiles of (a) core heating rates and
(b) ion temperatures averaged over the dense core region (ρ > 50g/cm3) for compressed plasma density of

2nc(with the density gap) and 100nc(without it) are shown in Fig.6.

core region (ρ > 50g/cm3) with (solid line) and without (dash line) the density gap.

The  solid  line  shows  the  results  for  the  case  considering  the  density  gap  effect  behind  the  cone  tip,

while  the  dash  line  represents  the  case  neglecting  this  effect,  respectively.  In  the  case  including  the

density gap effect, the electron beam intensity is lower than that of the neglecting case in the early stage (t

<  2000  [fs])  because  fast  electrons  are  slightly  decelerated  by  the  electrostatic  potential.  As  a  result,  the

core  heating  rate  with  the  gap  is  also  lower  and  the  ion  temperature  increases  slowly.  The  core  heating

duration is, however, longer because the fast electrons with relatively low-energy, which are confined and

sloshing inside the cone tip, are constantly delivered to the core after finishing laser  irradiation. Thus the

core is heated up from 0.33 [keV] to 0.49 [keV], ~ 69% higher increment by the density gap effect, but it

is still lower than the temperature measured in the experiments, ~ 0.8 [keV].

5. Summary

We  have  shown  the  outline  of  the  FI3  project  and  the  preliminary  results  of  integrated  simulations

using  three  codes,  the  ALE  hydro  (PINOCO),  the  collective  PIC  code  (FISCOF1),  and  the  relativistic

Fokker-Planck  code  (RFP).  We  have  found  that  fast  electrons  generated  by  the  laser-plasma  interaction

were  too  hot  to  efficiently  heat  the core.  Considering  the  density  gap  at  the  contact  surface  between  the

cone  tip  and  the  imploded  plasma,  we  estimated  the  fast  electron  profiles  with  one-dimensional  PIC

simulations.  We found that the period of core heating became longer because bulk electrons were heated

up to enough temperature to contribute for core heating by the two-stream instability,  and some fractions

of  the  fast  electrons,  which  were  confined  and  sloshing  inside  the  cone,  continuously  exuded  after

vanishing the laser pulse and also heated the core.

  Including the density gap effect, we performed FI3 integrated simulations for the recent core heating

experiment  with  cone-guided  targets,  and  estimated  the  core  temperature.  The  core  was  found  to  reach

0.49 [keV] with ~ 69% higher increment compared  with the case neglecting the density  gap effect. Even

with  the  density  gap  effect,  we  cannot  get  core  heating  observed  in  the  experiments  by  the  present

integrated simulations. As we introduced artificial corrections to realize conditions of the experiments, we

should  try to  run  the  PIC code  under  the  same parameters  as  the  experiments. Each  of  the  codes  is  also

required to improve simulation model to fit more realistic situations.

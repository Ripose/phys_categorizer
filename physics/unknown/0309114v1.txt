Abstract 

The equilibrium of a finite-β cylindrical RFP plasma in the presence of saturated-amplitude tearing 

modes  is  investigated.  The  singularities  arising  from  the  perturbative  analysis  of  the  MHD  force 
balance equation J×B=∇p are resolved through a proper regularization of the cylindrical symmetric 

component of the pressure and parallel current density profiles, by setting to zero their gradient at 

the  modes  rational  surfaces.  An  equilibrium  model,  which  satisfies  the  regularization  rule  at  the 

various  rational  surfaces,  is  developed.  The  comparison  with  the  experimental  data  from  the 

Reversed Field eXperiment (RFX) gives encouraging results. The model provides an easy tool to 

extrapolate the magnetic data, ordinarily measured only at the plasma edge, inside the plasma. As 

an application, we present the computation of the particle and heat stochastic diffusion coefficient 

from the reconstructed magnetic field profile. 

1. Introduction 

The study of the equilibrium configuration in Reversed Field Pinches (RFPs) is a far more difficult 

subject  than  in  Tokamaks.  The  reason  is  that,  in  the  former  devices,  the  sustainment  of  the 

configuration against resistive diffusion is provided by the plasma itself through the generation of 

magnetohydrodinamical  (MHD)  modes  (dynamo  modes)  [1].  Moreover  it  has  been  demonstrated 

that  the  stationary  configuration  cannot  be  axisymmetric  [2]  (this  fact  is  commonly  called 

Cowling’s theorem). The result is that the RFP equilibrium configuration has to be recovered from 

a  self-consistent,  essentially  three-dimensional  (3-D)  MHD  calculation.  A  magnetic  configuration 

characterized  by  saturated-amplitude  MHD  modes  is  described  by  the  3-D  equilibrium  force 

balance equation, whose simplest form is

Note  that  the  flow  effects  related  to  the  convective  inertial  term  and  the  viscous  force  have  been 

neglected  in  (1.1):  our  system  of  equations  (1.1,1.2)  describes  an  equilibrium  in  which  the 

electromagnetic force dominates any other term in the motion equation. This simplifying hypothesis 

can  be  justified  by  the  fact  that  in  RFPs  plasma  the  modes  for  sufficiently  high  amplitude  are 

always  phase  locked  together.  According  to  the  analysis  discussed  in  [3]  the  phase-locking 

configuration  is  almost  entirely  determined  by  the  electromagnetic  force  and  only  very  weakly 

affected by plasma inertia and viscosity.  

Present days RFPs are endowed with rather large aspect ratios, hence toroidicity-induced effects are 

expected  to  be  subdominant  and  we  will  neglect  them  here.  Thus,  we  choose  to  work  in  a 

cylindrical  geometry:  the  system  is  taken  to  be  periodic  in  the  z-direction  with  periodicity  length 
2πR, and a simulated toroidal angle φ =z/R is defined, so the coordinates are (r,θ,φ). 

A  fully  3D  treatment  of  Eqns.  (1.1,1.2)  would  necessarily  imply  a  numerical  approach. 

Nevertheless the adoption of a perturbative method can be instructive as well. This is suggested by 

the  fact  that  the  dominant  part  of  the  magnetic  field  is  cylindrically  symmetric  (zeroth-order 

component), and any deviation from axisymmetry can be regarded as a perturbation. Therefore, any 
field A (which stands for Bi, Ji, or p) can be written as:  

1.3)  A(r,θ,φ) = A0 (r) + a1(r,θ,φ) + a2 (r,θ,φ) + ... ;                    ai (r,θ,φ) =

m,n (r)e
ai

)
(
i mθ− nφ

 

∑

m,n

where the terms ai indicates the perturbative order. The Fourier harmonics, associated to the plasma 
modes, are characterized by a poloidal mode number m, and a toroidal mode number n (n≠0). The 

most important instabilities thought to exist in an RFP are tearing modes [4, 5]. They are resonant 
m,n for which the cylindrical safety factor q(r) ≡ r / R B0

θ
φ
(r )satisfies the 
(r) / B0

modes, i.e. a radius rs

condition  q=m/n,  exists  inside  the  plasma.  The  (zeroth-order)  flux-surface  where  the  previous 

condition holds is named (m, n) rational surface. Therefore in the expansion (1.3) we will take into 

consideration  only  resonant  harmonics.  Tearing  modes  develop  owing  to  the  small  but  finite 

resistivity  of  the  plasma.  The  resistivity  breaks  the  flux-freezing  constraint  in  the  Faraday-Ohm’s 

2

 

 

 

 

law,  and  allows  the  tearing  and  reconnection  of  equilibrium  magnetic  flux  surfaces,  to  produce 

helical magnetic islands centered on each rational surface.  

It is known that for arbitrary zeroth-order fields the resonant harmonics ai

m,n exhibit singularities at 

the  modes  rational  surfaces.  Nevertheless,  a  proper  regulation  of  zeroth  order  field  avoids  the 

occurrence of such infinities [6]. The possibility of applying the regularization relies on the large 

latitude for the choice of the zeroth-order profiles. Moreover, the zeroth order field of the expansion 

(1.3) cannot be merely an arbitrary initial profile (such the one considered in the stability analysis), 

but  must  contain  the  modification  produced  by  the  presence  of  the  saturated  modes.  It  is  in  fact 

known  that  magnetic  islands  determine  a  localized  flattening  of  the  pressure  and  parallel  current 

density  profiles  at  the  rational  surfaces  [7].  It  will  be  shown  that  the  local  flattening  is  just  the 

zeroth-order  regularization  required.  This  can  have  an  important  global  effect  on  the  profiles.  In 

fact  in  the  presence  of  many  resonant  modes  the  combined  effect  of  the  regularizations  at  the 

different rational surfaces determines an overall flattening of the profiles: the more modes we have, 

the flatter the profile we get. Tokamak plasmas are almost totally driven by external means and it is 

likely that the influence of instabilities on equilibrium profile be small there. On the other hand, in 

RFPs  plasmas  the  dynamo  modes  determine  a  relaxation  (flattening)  of  the  equilibrium  profiles 

which  drive  the  configuration  near  the  Taylor’s  minimum  energy  state  [8]  characterized  by  a 

constant  parallel  current  density  (normalized  to  the  magnetic  field).  Therefore  the  regularization 

procedure seems a suitable way to quantify the relaxation of the zeroth-order profiles due to these 

modes.  There  are  mainly  two  experimental  observations  that  support  this  hypothesis:  a)  in  the 

Reversed  Field  eXperiment  (RFX)  device  [9],  several  resonant  instabilities  are  observed  and  the 

parallel  current  profile  is  very  flat.  This  is  not  only  indicated  by  the  standard  α-Θ0  equilibrium 

model  [1],  commonly  adopted  for  RFPs,  but  it  is  also  confirmed  and  reinforced  by  the  internal 

polarimetric measurements [10]. b) When some of the secondary m=1 modes disappear, either for a 
spontaneous  process  (α-mode  [11])  or  for  an  external  influence  (Pulsed  Poloidal  Current  Drive-

PPCD  [12]),  a  steepening  of  the  parallel  current  profile  is  observed.  The  same  behaviour  is 

observed  for  the  pressure,  even  if  only  the  electronic  component  can  be  measured  [13].  Another 

confirmation  of  these  ideas  comes  from  the  recently  published  reconstruction  of  the  MST 

equilibrium profiles [14].  

The plan of the work is the following: in Section 2 we analyze the problem of the equilibrium in the 

presence of saturated resonant instabilities, showing how to overcome the singularities by the ad-

hoc regularization. For simplicity we will discuss in detail only the first perturbative order, giving a 

comment for the higher order corrections. In Sections 3 we show how the regularization rule leads 

in  a  natural  way  to  a  numerical  model  for  computing,  under  some  reasonable  assumptions,  the 

 

3

zeroth-order  profiles.  The  required  informations  are  the  global  equilibrium  parameters  Θ,  F,  βp, 

commonly  adopted  for  the  description  of  the  RFPs  equilibria,  and  the  number  of  observed 

instabilities. Although to a large extent completely general, the actual numerical implementation of 

the algorithm relies here and there on specific features of the machine. We have chosen to adapt it 

to the RFX experiment. Section 4 is devoted to the description of the numerical algorithm adopted 

for  solving  equilibrium  equations.  Section  5  gives  examples  of  application  of  the  algorithm  to 

specific RFX plasmas: zeroth-order profiles derived by our model are computed and compared with 

the standard α-Θ0 prediction. We also give an estimate for the first-order perturbation profiles and 

amplitudes  inside  the  plasma,  starting  from  the  measurement  of  their  values  at  the  edge.  The 

analysis  [15]  indicates  that  the  perturbation  profiles  derived  from  the  first  order  equations  are  a 

good approximation of the overall perturbation profile. This allows the spatial reconstruction of the 

total  field  perturbation.  This  part  has  been  presented  elsewhere  [16].  The  knowledge  of  the  full 

magnetic field is essential also for an understanding of correlated quantities, e.g., transport. Particle 

transport  in  RFPs  is  known  to  be  anomalous;  the  Rechester-Rosembluth  theory  relates  it  to  the 

diffusive  motion  of  magnetic  field  lines.  In  sections  6,  7  we  accept  this  assumption,  and  use  the 

computed magnetic field profiles to estimate transport coefficients, to be compared with estimates 

from the experiment. These results are entirely new. Section 8 summarizes the whole work, points 

out  some  less-developed  points  as  well  as  possible  improvements.  Appendix  A  provides  a 

complementary justification of the regularization rule within the island formalism.

In a real experiment it is unlikely that the pressure gradient could have values significantly greater 
than zero. Therefore we set g(r) ≤ 0 , so our pressure profiles are monotonic decreasing.

This is the standard force-balance equation for a (m,n) radial field in finite-β cylindrical RFP. It is 

possible to demonstrate that this equation is equivalent to the one reported in [17]. 

2.3 Resonant modes 

As  written  in  the  introduction,  a  mode  (m,  n)  is  resonant  if  the  condition  F m,n (rs
satisfied  for  0 < rs
Fm,n≠0. Equation (2.17) must then be solved in the two separate regions between the axis and the 
m,n, rshell], 

m,n < a ,  where  a  is  the  plasma  radius.  Note  that  equations  (2.12-2.17)  hold  for 

m,n [, and between the rational surface and the external boundary ]rs

rational surface [0, rs

which is assumed to be given by an ideal shell located at r = rshell. Let us discuss the behaviour of

The  lowerscript  rs  means  that  all  the  quantities  in  the  right-hand  side  must  be  evaluated  at  the 
location of the resonant surface. Also, note that y≤ 0 since g0 ≤ 0. 

A regular solution of (2.19) is written as [18]: 

+ L1x ln x + L2 x + L3 x 2 ln x + o(x 2 )  

 
and ν≥ 0 , L0≠ 0. Inserting in (2.19) one gets the following conditions

which  will  be  hereafter  labeled  with  the  further  lowerscript  "L"  or  "S".  We  suppose  that  the 

condition 1+4y > 0 holds, otherwise the solution would exhibit oscillating singular behaviour for 
x→0. It is possible to show that this condition is just the Suydam criterion:

applied  at  the  rational  surface.  This  prescription  makes  the  solution  (2.22)  (i.e.  the  radial  field 

harmonic) a regular function approaching the rational surface.  

We require, furthermore, that also the poloidal, toroidal field and pressure harmonics (2.12, 2.13, 
2.15)  be  regular  (i.e.,  finite)  function  for  x →0.  By  inserting  expressions  (2.22,  2.23)  into  (2.12, 

2.13, 2.15), we note two potentially singular terms; the former arises from the term including the 
derivative of χ: 

2.30) 

χ= νx

ν−1 sgn( x)⋅ L(x) + x

ν

[
L1 ln x + o(1)

] 

 
The second is due to the 1/Fm,n  term: its contribution is of the form   

2.31) 

χ= g0 x

ν−1 sgn( x) ⋅ L(x )  

d
dx

g0
x

Since these expressions are differently linear combined in (2.12, 2.13, 2.15) it is not possible that 

the divergences cancel out each other, and instead they must be regularized separately.  

This  implies  g0  =  y  =  0,  otherwise  0<ν < 1 (see  (2.28))  and  the  terms  with  x

would  be 

ν−1

divergent. The condition g0 = y = 0 imposes that the radial derivative of the zeroth-order pressure 

vanishes  at  the  rational  surface.  Moreover,  the  request  of  having  a  monotonic  pressure  profile 

brings to the further condition g1 = 0 (there must be a saddle-point, otherwise the rational surface 

would be the location for a local extremum).  

Therefore the two possible exponents of (2.28) are  

 
2.32)  νL= 0 , νS= 1.  

The “large” solution gives a singular ‘ln|x|’ term in (2.30). Therefore we set  

2.33)  L1,L

= 0  

9

which, together with (2.26, 2.27), yields  

 
2.34)  w = 0; L3,L

= 0 . 

Therefore, the "large" solution reduces to

The condition w = 0, together with g0 = g1 =0 implies σ1 = 0: that is, the radial derivative of the 

parallel current profile also must vanish at the rational surface.  

Note  that  the  “large”  solution,  which  has  a  finite  radial  field  at  the  rational  surface,  is  not 

compatible  with  the  ideal  form  of  the  Faraday-Ohm’s  equation,  for  which  br  ∝  x  ξr    near  the 

rational  surface  [19]  (ξr  is  the  radial  plasma  displacement).  Our  discussion  assumes  therefore 

implicitly the effect of resistivity in the Faraday-Ohm’s law. 

Since we have imposed w = 0, for the "small" solution, using again Eqns. (2.25 - 2.27), one gets 

In  conclusion  the  request  that  the  first-order  harmonics  be  finite  when  approaching  the 

corresponding  rational  surface  impose  the  following  regularization  conditions  on  the  zeroth-order 

profiles

Equation  (2.17)  is  solved  imposing  the  suitable  conditions  at  the  origin  and  at  the  external

be possible to solve the problem with a first radial derivative dψ/dr continuous at rS. The jump of 
dψ/dr  across  the  rational  surface  corresponds  to  the  presence  of  a  localized  helical  current  sheet

is  a  much  more  complex  task,  due  to  the  presence  of  non-linear  coupling  terms  in  the  first-order 

perturbations.  This  has  been  carried  out  in  ref.  [20]  for  a  zero-pressure  equilibrium.  The 
generalization  to  the  finite-β  case  appears  wearisome.  Anyway,  we  are  confident  that  the 

regularization previously described holds also for these higher order equations. In fact in the zero-

pressure  case  equation  (2.14)  is  modified  just  to  incorporate  the  coupling  terms  (see  eqns.  (A43-

A61) of [20]). These extra terms are potentially singular at the modes rational surfaces, but they are 
all proportional to dσ/dr. Therefore these extra singularities can be healed by the same prescription 

here described, i.e. flattening σ(r) near the rational surfaces.  

3. A model for current    and pressure profiles 

According  to  the  previous  discussion,  in  the  presence  of  saturated  resonant  modes  the  quantities 
dσ/dr,  g(r)  and  dg/dr  must  vanish  at  the  mode  rational  surfaces.  In  RFX  we  have  m=0  modes 

resonant at the q = 0 surface (the reversal surface), and many m=1 modes whose rational surface is 

inside the reversal surface (internally resonant modes). Therefore we make the ansatz 

(3.1) 

(r) = M(r) f (r), g(r) = M 2 (r)h(r)

where M(r) is the “regularization” term

which automatically satisfies dσ/dr= g(r)= dg/dr= 0 at the m=1 and m= 0 mode rational surfaces, 

provided  that  the  shape  functions  f(r),  h(r)  (till  now  undefined)  are  there  regular  functions.  This 

11

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regularization  prescription  is  similar  to  that  discussed  in  [6].  If  we  want  a  monotonic  decreasing 
σ(r) profile then we set

together  with  the  supplementary  constrain  f(r)≤  0.  Note  that,  due  to  the  modulus,  in  this  case  the 

second  derivative  of  σ  is not defined at the rational surfaces. Nevertheless the expressions (2.18-

2.20)  require  the  first  derivative  only.  At  r=  0,  for  symmetry  reasons,  we  have  dσ(0)/dr=0  and 

Note that M is indeed a function of q; as long as q(r) is a monotonic function, we can use q in place

at r= 0 are automatically satisfied. From (3.1, 3.4) we get

where qa is the value at the plasma boundary, in RFX determined by a graphite wall placed at the 

radius  a  =  0.457  m.  The  graphite  wall  leans  against  an  inconel  vessel  located  at  r=  rV  ,  beyond 

which there is a vacuum region which extends up to the conducting shell placed at  rshell= 1.17⋅ a. 

In  a  situation  of  stationary  modes  (which  is  the  standard  situation  in  RFX)  helical  eddy  currents 

cannot  be  induced  in  the  vessel,  so  both  ψ  and  dψ/dr  are  continuous  at  r=  rV.  There  is  still  the 

possibility for zeroth-order current to flow in the inconel vessel; our fluid model fails there, but we 

are confident that its amplitude is so small that it can be safely neglected. Furthermore zeroth-order

currents  cannot  flow  at  all  in  the  graphite  wall  [21].  In  conclusion  we  treat  the  entire  region 

between the plasma boundary and the shell as vacuum:  

(3.7) 

 σ(r) = 0,  g(r)= 0   for  a< r< rshell  

Notice  that  if  we  want  equation  (2.14)  to  hold  at  the  boundary  r= a, then we need the quantities 
σ, dσ/dr, g(r), dg/dr to be defined there. The condition (3.7) then implies 

From g(a)= 0= dp0(a)/dr and p0(r>a)= 0 it follows p0(qa )= 0. Moreover, conditions (3.8) force the 

(3.8) 

 σ(a)= g(a)= dσ(a)/dr= dg(a)/dr = 0   

following constraints on the functions w, u:  

 
(3.9) w(qa ) = 0; u (qa ) = 0 = du
dq qa

 

The model depends upon some parameters to be chosen on the basis of supplementary assumptions: 

in RFX the zeroth-order profiles are characterized by the three experimental parameters

where Φt  is the toroidal flux. All the edge magnetic quantities are provided by a direct measure, so 
we can consider the determination of Θ, F to be exact. Instead, the integral which appears in the 
expression for βp depends on the assumption made on the pressure profile. At present, in RFX βp is 

computed assuming given polynomial expressions for the electron density and temperature profiles. 
Our pressure model is different, so we take this “experimental” βp only as a reference value. Note 

that  

(3.11)   qa

so qa can be used in place of F or Θ. 

13

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  we  require  that  different  triplets  (F, Θ,  βp)  correspond  to  different  profiles,  the  number  of  free 

parameters  must  be  at  least  three.  Another  element  to  take  into  consideration  is  the  Suydam 

criterion  (2.29)  for  the  pressure  gradient.  In  our  model  this  criterion  is  verified  in  most  of  the 

plasma,  due  to  the  prescriptions  (3.1-3.2)  which  flatten  the  pressure  profile  on  a  wide  region.  A 

violation  could  arise  in  the  edge  zone,  because  in  our  model  the  pressure  gradient  is  mostly 

concentrated  there.  Anyway  we  have  no  elements  to  say  that  in  RFX  the  Suydam  criterion  is 

everywhere fulfilled, and we cannot indeed exclude the presence of localized interchange modes at 

the  very  edge  of  the  plasma.  This  discussion  suggests  that  a  fourth  free  parameter  is  needed  to 

model the pressure profile near the plasma boundary: this parameter will be tuned in order satisfy, 

at least marginally, the Suydam criterion there.  

According to these arguments and to the condition (3.9), the simplest model for the functions w, u 

yields the expressions

where  the  four  free  parameters  are qa, the normalization constant  u0 and the exponents ξ, η. The 

normalization  constant  w0  is  not  free  but  depends  on  (qa  ,  ξ)  as  well  as  on  the  definition  of  the 

regularization term M(r). This will be demonstrated in the following discussion.  

4. Getting the solution: numerical scheme 

4.1 Computation of the zeroth-order profiles 

The actual procedure to obtain the zeroth-order profiles for a given triplet (F, Θ, βp) or (qa, F, βp) is 

quite  involved  and  in  principle,  there  is  not  guarantee  for  the  solution  to  be  unique,  though  we 

found that all of the admissible solutions are very close between them.  

4.1.1 Definition of M(r) 

First of all, the two possible choices (3.2, 3.3) for the regularization term M(r) discriminate between 
monotonic  and  not-monotonic  σ(r)  profiles.  An  integrated  analysis  [10]  of  the  external  magnetic 

signals and the data provided by a five-chord infrared (FIR) polarimeter indicates that in RFX the 
σ(r)  profiles  should  be  very  flat,  or  even  hollow  with  a  maximum  in  the  external  region  of  the 

plasma.  In  our  model  the  flattening  of  the  σ(r)  is  a  direct  consequence  of  the  regularization  term 

M(r). Moreover with the non-monotonic choice (3.2) we have a local maximum of σ(r) just at the 

reversal surface where q(r)=0. We will investigate both possibilities (3.2, 3.3).  

14

 

 

 

 

 

In  actual  calculations,  the  product  over  (1,  n)  modes  must  -of  course-  be  truncated  to  a  finite 

number of terms. The number of m=1 factors in M(r) is determined by the experimentally observed 

modes. Generally in RFX the dominant internally resonant m=1 modes have a toroidal number in 
the range n=7÷12. There is also a tail of secondary modes which in some pulses can also extend to 

high  (n≈18)  mode  numbers.  Taking  into  account  that  the  flattening  of  the  computed  σ(r),  p0(r) 

profiles  extends  beyond  the  resonance  position  of  the  m=1,  n=  nmax  mode  (this  effect  is  more 
pronounced for the pressure, because we have a term M2(r) there), the range [nmin, nmax] of factors 

in M(r) is chosen in order to include all of the dominant modes and most of the secondary modes, 

with the check a posteriori that the flat region of σ(r) and p0(r) includes all of the rational surfaces 

of the modes experimentally observed. The latter condition requires a lower number of factors for 
g(r) than for σ(r), so we leave the possibility that nmax appearing in the definition of M(r) could be 
different  for  σ(r)  and  g(r).  In  conclusion,  there  is  some  freedom  in  the  definition  of  M(r),  but 

different plausible choices of the m=1 factors do not substantially change the profiles.  

4.1.2 Computation of q(r) and σ(r) 

Having defined M(r), we set qa equal to the experimental value (3.11), and guess a value ξ>0 for 
the exponent of w(q). First of all we compute the q(r) and σ(r) profiles: in fact the two equations 

(2.5-2.6) can be combined to give a single equation for q(r) where the pressure gradient term g(r) 
does not appear. We combine this equation with the expression for dσ/dr to form the system

The system is solved in the interval [0, a] . The apparently more natural direction of integration is 
from the edge towards the centre, since one knows the boundary conditions q(a) = qa , σ(a) = 0. 
Note that the condition σ(a) = 0 forces the normalization constant w0 to be (see (3.5, 3.12)): 

that is, the r.h.s. of the latter of (4.1) depends upon the unknown value of σ at the centre. For this 

reason it is more convenient to solve eqns. (4.1) in the direction from the centre towards the edge, 

using guessed initial values q0, σ(0), and iterating until the matching at the edge with the boundary 

conditions is obtained. To this purpose, remember that the relation

must  be  satisfied.  Of  course,  the  value  of  σ(0)  must  also  be  consistent  with  the  resonant  modes 
− 1) / R < σ(0) < 2nmin / R must hold. We just 
taken in the product (3.2), so the condition  2(nmin
mention further that the r.h.s of the former of (4.1), in the limit r → 0, takes the form 0/0. Thus, 

some care must be exerted in handling this limit. 

4.1.3 Computation of B0φ(r), B0θ(r) 

The σ(r)  and q(r) profiles obtained from (4.1) are then used to determine the zeroth-order magnetic 

fields by solving equations (2.5, 2.6). The pressure gradient g(r) is given by

In (4.4) and (4.5) q(r) is just the solution derived from (4.1). The parameter u0 is tuned in order to 

have from the last of (3.10) a βp close to the experimental estimated value. The exponent η has little 

influence  on  βp.  It  only  determines  the  pressure  gradient  at  the  plasma  edge  and  is  chosen  by 

comparison with the Suydam criterion. 

In general the F and Θ parameters computed from the solutions B0φ(r), B0θ(r) are close (they stand 

in  the  correct  ratio)  but  not  equal  to  the  experimental  values.  To  match  the  desired  values  it  is 
sufficient  to  change  slightly  the  exponent  ξ  or  the  number  of  m=1  resonance  (  i.e.  nmax  )  and  to 

repeat the procedure starting from equation (4.1).

To  summarize,  our  procedure  involves  solving  equations  (2.5,  2.6,  4.1)  through  fitting  some  free 

parameters to experimental quantities. Roughly speaking, we can sketch the following recipe:

mostly related to the corresponding request of the left column.  
 

We remark that Table I must be considered just as a quick reminder: actually, varying any of the 

quantity in the right-hand column affects several quantities in left-hand column. 

It is convenient to adopt the following normalization for the zeroth-order quantities when working 

with the above equations (we remind again RFX parameters: R=2 m, a=0.457 m):  

4.6)    ˆ r = r / a;

ˆ R = R / a;

ˆ g = g ⋅ a;

ˆ σ = σ⋅ a;

4.2 First-order perturbation quantities 

As remarked in the introduction the first-order perturbation can be taken as a good approximation of 

the ‘true’ perturbation [15]. The radial profile of the various (m, n) first-order harmonics is obtained 
from  eq.  (2.17),  which  is  solved  using  the  zeroth-order  profiles  for  σ(r)  and  g(r),  computed 

17

 

 

 

 

 

 

according  to  the  method  just  outlined.  The  edge  boundary  conditions,  which  determine  the 

perturbation amplitudes, are given by the experimental measurements, in RFX available  at the shell:

m,n ( ˆ r shell ); 

The  first  condition  (4.10)  is  strictly  true  only  for  an  ideal  shell.  The  RFX  shell  is  thick  but  not 

exactly  ideal,  since  a  slow  penetration  of  the  radial  field  is  observed.  This  is  shown  by  the 

measurements of two poloidal arrays of radial field pick-up coils placed on the inner surface of the 

shell. At present toroidal arrays of radial field probes, which are necessary to obtain the harmonics 
m,n  (proportional to χm,n ) at a given radius, are not available. Therefore the simplest way to set the 

br
initial  value  for  χm,n  is  to  adopt  the  ideal  shell  approximation  (assumed  in  all  of  the  following 

examples).  

The second condition (4.10) is derived by a combination of (2.13, 2.16) applied in vacuum, and by 
the ideal shell constraint χm,n(rshell)=0. The harmonic  bφ
m,n is indeed measured at the shell (for the 

m= 0, 1, modes) by two toroidal arrays of 72 equally spaced toroidal field pick-up coils placed at 

opposite poloidal angles [22].  
The  condition  near  the  origin  is  χm,n ( ˆ r ) ∝ ˆ r m +1/ 2
phase ϕm,n of the harmonic ψm,n is taken constant with respect to r, so we can write  

  for  m≠0  and  χ0,n ( ˆ r ) ∝ ˆ r 3 / 2   for  m=0.  The

In the last equality of (4.13) we have taken into account that the third term in the square bracket of 

(2.12, 2.13) is zero at the rational surface, because g(r) has a second order zero there. 

5. Examples of application of the method 
5.1 Zeroth-order profiles: monotonic σ(r) 

Table  2  reports  some  examples  of  zeroth-order  profiles  computations  with  the  assumption  of  a 

monotonic  σ(r),  therefore  using  the  definition  (3.3)  for  M(r).  Note  that  in  this  case  w0  >  0,  so 
dσ(r)/dr is negative everywhere, being dq/dr<0.

Our model provides profiles which fit the global/edge measured parameters (F, Θ, βp). Comparing 

our results with whole radial shape of the profiles is at present impossible, since in RFX we have 

not a shot-by shot measurement of these profiles. Anyway, as told in sec 4.1, the first experimental 
reconstruction of σ(r) indicates a flat profile (see fig. 4 of Ref. [10]), which is largely compatible 

with  the  plots  shown  below.  The  same  is  true  for  the  pressure,  even  if  only  the  electronic 

component is measured (see fig. 4 of Ref. [13]).

predicts  a  weak  increase  of  σ(r)  towards  zero,  and  in  the  external  region  where  we  obtain  a  more 

extended  flat  zone,  a  further  flattening  in  correspondence  of  the  m=0  resonance  (r≈  0.9a)  and  a 

smoother behaviour near the plasma boundary. The flat region 0.3 < r < 0.8 corresponds to the location 

of m=1 modes. Figs. (2-4) show the other fundamental quantities calculated within the model.

Pulse 11029, t = 35 ms, during PPCD 

The  same  shot  is  considered  when  the  PPCD  [12]  is  active.  During  the  PPCD  some  of  the 

secondary  m=1  modes  disappear.  This  entails  a  reduction  of  nmax  in  M(r)  and  a  consequent 
steepening of the σ(r) profile (fig. 5).

Θ0 model 

The peaking of the profile is also predicted by the α-Θ0 model. A similar peaking is apparent in the 

pressure profile, and it is also observed experimentally [13]. Moreover the pressure gradient at the 

22

 

 

edge  is  found  to  decrease  in  our  model  (fig.6).  As  discussed  is  the  introduction  this  confirms  the 

existence of a connection between the number of the instabilities and the shape of the zeroth-order 

profiles. During the PPCD the activity of the dynamo modes is weaker and consequently the profile 

is less relaxed (steeper). 

 

 

 

Fig. 6. During the PPCD our model satisfies the Suydam criterion also at the very edge of the plasma. 

 

 

 
Alike the PPCD, the so called α-mode is characterized by a decrease of the secondary m=1 modes 

and  by  a  steepening  of  the  profiles.  In  the  α-mode  reported  in  the  table  our  model  satisfies  the 

Suydam criterion also at the very edge of the plasma. 

 
 
 
As mentioned before in sec.4.1, there are evidences supporting the possibility for σ profiles to be 

5.2 Zeroth-order profiles: non-monotonic σ(r) 

non-monotonic  in  RFX  plasmas.  In  our  formalism,  it  means  using  Eq.  (3.2)  instead  of  (3.3)  in 

computations. Note that in this case w0<0, because of the significant negative contribution of M(r) 

to the integral (4.2) in the region between the reversal and the edge. With this kind of profile we 
found that the convergence of equations (2.5, 2.6, 4.1) to the experimental desired values of (F, Θ, 
βp) is not guaranteed. We relate this to the following physical aspects of the problem:  
(I) we have found that a necessary condition is a decreasing σ(r) between the origin and the first 

m=1 rational surface. With the monotonic profile this condition is automatically fulfilled. Instead, 

using the definition (3.1) it is satisfied only with an odd number of m= 1 mode. This suggest that 
the non-monotonic model for σ(r) should be refined including an extra factor, e.g.:

(II) There should not be too much distance between the rational surface corresponding to nmax  and 
the reversal position, otherwise σ(r), which has a positive derivative in this region, could grow to 

unreasonable  values  at  the  reversal.  This  requires  a  configuration  with  a  considerable  number  of 

secondary m=1 modes, in other word a sufficiently relaxed profile.  
(III) Since in the non-monotonic case the maximum of σ(r) is reached at the reversal surface and it 

is unlikely that too much current be driven at the very edge of the plasma, the reversal should be at 

a suitable distance from the plasma boundary, i.e. the F parameter should be sufficiently negative, 

to make the profile plausible.  

Table 3 lists some specific cases. From fig.7 one can notice a significant departure from the α-Θ0 

reconstruction. Figure 8 instead compares the monotonic and non-monotonic models.

6. Application of the model: particle and heat transport following stochastic line fields  

The  particle  and  heat  radial  transport  is  a  problem  of  fundamental  importance  in  the  context  of 

performances of magnetically confined plasmas. It is well known that transport caused by Coulomb 

collisions in curved magnetic fields (neoclassical theory) only marginally accounts for transport in 

present tokamaks and is completely off the mark in present RFPs. This is ascribed to the destruction 

of magnetic surfaces due to MHD instabilities. Each mode, at the location of its resonance, leads to 

creation of magnetic islands and stochastic regions. The existence in RFPs of several modes, as we 

have just shown, leads to overlapping of the islands and hence to global stochasticity over a large 

fraction  of  the  volume.  Any  given  particle  performs  a  ballistic  motion  along  a  field  line  but  the 

overall  displacement,  due  to  the  wandering  nature  of  lines  themselves,  can  be  less  than  linearly 

increasing with time. Rechester and Rosenbluth [23] showed that, in a homogeneous magnetic field, 

the resulting motion along the radial direction is diffusive, with a diffusion coefficient

magnetic  perturbation).  A  precise  comparison  with  empirical  data  is  difficult  within  the  naive 

formulation  (6.1),  because  of  the  neglect  of  many  realistic  details.  A  full  account  is  given  in  the 

paper by Maluckov et al [24], although they were presented already in [25], where an approximated 

version of our calculations was introduced. Briefly, Eq. (6.1) “forgets”:     

28

 

 

 

 

 

 

(I) Coulomb collisions. The particle motion is ballistic along the field line only until it is abruptly 

scattered on a different line by a collision with another charged particle. This effect is important in 

low-temperature highly collisional plasmas. 

(II) Inhomogeneity of the magnetic field. This arises since fusionistic magnetic fields need a shear 

and,  unavoidably,  because  of  the  finite  size  of  the  plasma.  Authors  [24,25]  showed  that  the 

existence  of  boundaries  has  a  dramatic  qualitative  effect  on  the  long-time  transport,  altering  its 

nature  from  diffusive  to  sub-diffusive  (i.e.,  the  mean  squared  displacement  increases  less  than 

linearly  with  time):  a  field  line  can  freely  displace  from  its  initial  position  only  until  reaches  the 

proximity of the confining walls. After that, its motion is strongly constrained.   

These  limitations  can  be  overridden  only  under  some  plasma  regimes.  Another  obvious  reason 

~
precluding the simple use of (6.1) is that the normalized perturbation amplitude b

 should be known 

everywhere  inside  the  plasma,  and  this  was  not  possible:  ordinarily,  magnetic  probes  are  used  to 

measure fluctuations amplitudes only at the plasma edge.  Our model is well suited for overcoming 

this  difficulty:  it  provides  the  “true”  perturbations  all  over  the  plasma,  once  just  their  boundary 

values are measured. 

Once the total field B is known from the previous sections, the trajectory of a field line is recovered 

by solving the differential equations

or, equivalently

where dl is an infinitesimal path length, x the instantaneous position, B(x) the local total magnetic 

field (function of the position x). In the zero-mass limit, a particle follows exactly the field line. Its 

velocity  is  v  =  dl/dt.    The  zero-mass  limit  should  be  a  rather  good  approximations  for  electrons, 

whose Larmor radius around the field line is much smaller than the typical scale of variation of B. 

Drift  motion  is  neglected  within  this  approximation,  but  it  should  not  be  a  concern,  since  we  are 

interested in the diffusive part of the motion. 

The r.h.s. of (6.2) are implicit functions of x. Furthermore, field lines are likely to be chaotic, i.e., 

sensitive  to  any  perturbation,  either  physical  or  numerical.  For  these  reasons  Eqns.  (6.2)  must  be 

integrated  using  an  accurate  solver:  we  used  a  predictor-corrector  scheme  with  a  order-1  Adams-

Bashfort algorithm for the predictor stage, and order-0 Adams-Moulton for the corrector stage.   

A  large  number  N  of  trajectories  are  followed,  starting  from  the  same  radial  position  and  with 

random poloidal and toroidal positions. The following statistical quantities are recorded:

In our investigation, we are interested to those regions where plasma is poorly collisional, hence we

The diffusion coefficient D is a measure of the global stochasticity of the plasma, hence-rigorously-

it should be a simple number, constant over spatial coordinates. As we have said above, however, 

finite-size effects impose a crossover from the diffusive behaviour (6.4) for small times, to a sub-

diffusive one (

) for larger times. Sub-diffusive motion can be accommodated 

into generalized fluid continuity equations through the use of fractional derivatives. This conflicts, 

however,  with  the  common  practice  of  describing  particle  transport  within  the  fairly  intuitive 

“diffusion+convection”  scheme.    We  resorted,  therefore,  to  evaluate  an  effective  diffusion 

coefficient by stopping the integration of (6.2) to times where Eq. (6.4) holds with a constant (i.e., 
time-independent) D ≡ Deff . In practical terms, we fitted <dr2> of (6.4) with a straight line, limiting 

to  regions  where  no  sign  of  saturation  was  still  visible.  It  is  clear  that,  in  this  way,  we  are 

preventing  the  system  from  sampling  the  entire  space.  Hence,  Deff  comes  from  a  local  average 

around the starting position and is, therefore, function of the radius. 

Prior to entering into quantitative calculations, an important comment is needed. Harvey et al. [26] 

showed that both particle and heat transport, in stochastic magnetic fields, are characterized by the 

same  coefficient  (6.1).  However,  because  of  the  unavoidable  insurgence  of  ambipolar  electric 

fields, the effective particle transport is not determined by electrons, rather by main ions (provided 

that  impurity  content  is  negligible).  That  is,  the  effective  (i.e.,  measured)  particle  diffusion 

coefficient  is  given  by  (6.1)  with  thermal  velocity  corresponding  to  the  ionic  one.  The  same 

constraint  does  not  apply  to  thermal  transport,  for  which  electron  velocity  must  instead  be  used.  

Within  the  above  context,  the  terms  “particle  transport”  and  “heat  transport”  can  be  used 

30

. It is known that 

in  RFX  this  ratio  does  not  rigorously  hold,  i.e.,  either  heat  or  particle  transport  does  not  follow 

exactly  Rechester-Rosembluth’s  predictions  [28];  stating  which  one  between  them  is  difficult 

because of the large empirical errors. Indeed, any discussion on experimental error bars would be a 

tough  one.  Again,  there  are  at  least  two  main  reasons  for  the  large  uncertainties  involved  in  this 

kind  of  measurements:  (I)  first  of  all,  no  density  local  measurements  are  possible,  but  only 

inversion  of  line-of-sight  measurements,  on  a  relatively  small  number  of  chords;  (II)  transport 

coefficients are calculated as a flux-over-gradient ratio, e.g, 

χ

Γ=

∇

/

heat

T

 (we have used here the 

more customary symbol χ instead of Dheat ). Temperature and particle profiles are very flat over a 

large  fraction  of  the  minor  radius,  in  RFX,  i.e.,  the  denominator  is  almost  zero.  Hence,  any 

uncertainty on it -to a large extent induced by the former point I- causes large errors on transport 

coefficients (for an estimate of heat transport coefficients and associated error bars, see [12, 27]). 

 7. Transport coefficients for some sample cases 

For transport studies, we will consider the shot 11030, that features both standard confinement as 

well  as  a  temporal  window  of  good  PPCD-induced  improved  confinement,  and  has  been  already 

used  for  PPCD  studies  [28].  PPCD  (for  Pulsed  Poloidal  Current  Drive)  is  a  well-established 

technique  for  improving  RFPs’  plasma  parameters,  although  only  transiently.  It  can  induce  an 

increase  of  electron  temperature  of  order  30%-50%  in  the  best  cases.  The  physical  mechanisms 

underlying this enhancement are not completely understood. The prevailing opinion is that PPCD 

replaces part of the spontaneous dynamo action of the plasma, hence allowing for a decrease of the 

magnetic  fluctuations,  a  reduced  overlapping  of  magnetic  islands  and,  eventually,  a  dimished 

stochastic transport.    

Figure  14  features  the  progressive  destruction  of  magnetic  surfaces  for  pulse  11029.  From  top  to 

bottom,  we  have  a  poloidal  cross  section  of  the  magnetic  surfaces  with:  (I)  no  radial  magnetic 

perturbation (i.e., only the B0 field); (II) a single-mode perturbation (in this case, we have retained 

the m=1, n = 8 mode); (III) the full (m = 1) mode spectrum. All plots are referred at t = 30 ms (i.e., 

prior to the start of PPCD).

lower panel, full perturbation. 

 

 

 

Figure  15  shows,  instead,  an  example  of  <dr2>  from  Eq.  (6.3).  We  can  clearly  distinguish  two 

regions:  one  of  linear  increase  (diffusive  region)  and  another  of  saturated  -or  even  reduced- 
displacement  (subdiffusive  region).  A  further  region  of  superdiffusive  motion  (<dr2>  ∝  t2  )  can 

perhaps be identified at the beginning of the simulations, although it is more apparent in other runs. 

The  diffusive  region  is  the  part  of  interest.  In  the  course  of  our  numerical  investigations,  we 

(re)discovered  some  unwanted  features:  the  diffusive  region  decreases  when  one  samples  zones 

close to the center or to the edge. This is sensible, since we expect the boundaries to have a more 

marked  effect  as  one  approaches  them.  Indeed,  they  were  already  present  in  the  paper  [25]. 

However,  the  practical  result  is  that  the  diffusive  region  quickly  shrinks  to  an  extent  such  that 

fitting  becomes  impossible.  For  this  reason,  we  must  limit  our  investigation  to  the  middle  region 

(say, 1/5 < r/a < 2/3). This is not too severe a limitation. On the one hand, we have not reasons to 

expect drastical changes when going towards the core. On the other hand, the core region can be 

only  badly  diagnosed,  hence  any  eventual  numerical  estimate  should  match  empirical  evaluations 

subject  to  fairly  large  error  bars.  On  the  other  hand,  the  edge  region,  where  data  from  the 

experiment  are  relatively  better,  is  the  ground  of  several  other  physical  processes  not  taken  into 

32

account  within  the  present  approach  (high  collisionality,  electric  field  gradients,  …)  which 

dramatically affect transport. Above all, the edge region features the reversal surface where the m = 

0 modes resonate. We have not taken them into consideration because: I) there is a lot of them, thus 

making  calculations  burdensome,  and  II)  their  amplitude  is  rather  small,  if  compared  to  m  =  1 

modes, hence their effect -far from the reversal surface- is likely to be negligible.   

Fig. 15: mean square radial displacement versus time. 

 

 

We  have  plotted  in  Figure  16  the  resulting  radial  profile  of  effective  diffusion  coefficient  (6.4) 

(linear  fit  to  <dr2>  data),  together  with  the  inferred  one  from  interferometry  data,  using  an 

interpretative code [29], and from a heat transport analysis [12, 28]. This, for two instants of time, 

one prior and one during PPCD. We plot in Fig. 17 the corresponding first-order amplitudes br for 

all of the (m = 1) modes involved. The prevailing of one single mode over all the others is dubbed 

Quasi-Single-Helicity (QSH). Its theoretical limit -

the Single Helicity state- involves the complete disappearance of all modes but one. This limit has 

been theoretically predicted as a potential RFP state fulfilling Cowling’s theorem but without the 

need of turbulence for the generation of dynamo field, hence a very appreciable situation [30,31]. In 

our case we are in a situation akin to QSH states: one mode (n = 7) increases in the central region of 
the plasma at the expenses of the secondary (n ≥ 9) modes. 

The disappearance of the small outermost modes during PPCD reflects on a decrease of D, χ in the 

outer region. By contrast, in the core region, transport during PPCD is even enhanced, since the two 

main modes (n=7,8) increase there.  

Indeed, it is clear any agreement between theory and experiment can only be qualitative. There are 

a few points that deserve to be stressed: I) experimentally, it is hardly possible to identify a non-
monotonic  D,  χ    profile,  because  of  the  lack  of  mesh  resolution.  This  means  that  the  decrease  of 

these  coefficients  when  going  towards  the  origin  -in  the  pre-PPCD  case-  cannot  be  ruled  out, 

although it is not supported by experimental findings. II) the decrease of the transport coefficients 

during PPCD is not as dramatic as suggested by experiment on the whole radius, instead it features 

more a transport barrier (this will appear more clearly below).

In order to give a further intuitive picture, together with a test about the correctness of our results, 

we  plot  in  Fig.  18  our  computed  ratio  between  transport  coefficients  during  and  before  PPCD 

(squares). According to equations above, this ratio should be weakly dependent on geometric and/or 

plasma factors, but the normalized perturbations amplitudes: roughly,

line in Fig. 18 is the r.h.s. of this equation. We see that our expectation is rather well fulfilled but 
for the points r/a ≤ 0.2. This is due to the fact that, in this region, our procedure was not able to give 

a reliable estimate for D prior to PPCD: the <dr2> versus t curve was never a true straight line but 

there was almost only a smooth crossover to saturation. Therefore, unavoidably, part of the fitting 

collected  points  that  pertained  to  the  subdiffusive  region.  The  resulting  slope  was  below  its  true 

value. The same did not appear so clearly for the PPCD-case, hence the effective D was estimated 

better. 

From the point of view of physics, it is remarkable to notice that the improved confinement region 

(where the ratio is less than one) is not spread all over the radius but only over a region of it (r/a > 

0.3).  This  is  at  a  difference  with  the  most  common  picture  of  PPCD,  which  foresees  a  global 

improvement of transport.   

8. Conclusions 

The equilibrium in a finite-β RFP plasma in the presence of saturated-amplitude tearing modes has 

been  investigated  analytically  and  numerically.  The  singularities  of  the  force  balance  equation  at 

the  modes  rational  surfaces  have  been  dealt  with  by  a  proper  regularization  of  the  zeroth-order 
cylindrically symmetric profiles: the gradients of the pressure and parallel current density (σ) are 

forced  to  be  equal  to  zero  there.  This  rule  has  been  combined  with  some  considerations  about 

general  bounds  plasmas  are  constrained  to,  to  guess  equilibrium  profiles  which  match  the  global 
discharge parameters (F, Θ, βp). The combined effects of a large number of modes makes the σ and 

pressure profiles flat over a large portion of the plasma, with a steep gradient in the edge region, 
although  non-monotonic  σ  profiles,  with  a  maximum  at  the  reversal  surface,  are  also  allowed  in 

principle. A corollary of our regularization rule is that to obtain steeper profiles an RFP needs to 

reduce  drastically  the  dynamo  modes  amplitude.  This  is  not  surprising,  if  we  think  that  all  the 
improved regime of operations in RFX (α-mode [11], PPCD [12], “single-helicity” states [30]) are 

characterized by a reduced mode amplitude.

At present, in RFX we do not have a shot-by shot measurement of σ and pressure profile. Anyway, 

the first experimental analysis of σ(r) [10] is largely compatible with our model. The same is true 

for the pressure, even if only the electronic component is measured [13]. When some of the modes 

are suppressed, the profiles both in our model and in the experiment become steeper.  

The model can be regarded as a method to obtain the final stage of relaxation process produced by 

the tearing modes. This equilibrium model allows the use of a relatively simple equation to get the 

various perturbations profiles. In this way a complete magnetic reconstruction is obtained.  

Some of the reasonings which have led us to the results shown in previous sections, are forcefully 

semi-quantitative,  therefore  some  room  to  arbitrariness  is  left.  In  particular,  we  think  that  finding 

further constraints allowing to better define "shape" functions w, u (Eq. 3.12), would be a possible 

improvement. Furthermore, the present version of our model allows only an “on/off” picture of the 

flattening  effect  of  the  resonant  modes  over  the  equilibrium.  In  a  more  sophisticated  model  a 

correlation  between  the  mode  amplitude  and  the  width  of  the  induced  flattening  should  be  self-

consistently taken into account. 

As it is, the model already lends itself to applications. The calculation of transport coefficients in a 

RFP is, indeed, an important issue.  The results we have obtained in sections 6,7 must be considered 

as  preliminary,  since  there  is  a  large  uncertainty  both  about  them,  as  well  as  about  the  empirical 

data they have to be compared to. Notwithstanding this, they appear encouraging since they are not 

grossly away from experiment. Also, if verified by further analysis, they show a picture of transport 

reduction  by  PPCD  which  is  slightly  different  from  the  standard  one,  i.e.,  instead  of  an  overall 

decrease of transport along the whole radius, one gets a rather localized one, corresponding to the 

outer region where smaller modes collapse, with some affinities to transport barriers in tokamaks.    

Appendix  

This  appendix  attempts  a  different  approach  to  the  equilibrium  in  the  presence  of  resonant 

perturbations, and confirms the results obtained in Section 2. 

Let’s assume the existence of an island centred on the (m,n) rational surface. To the lowest order 

the standard representation for the helical magnetic flux in the island rest frame is [32]:

 so 

the  pressure  derivative  is  zero  at  the  rational  surface,  both  for  the  cylindrical  and  the  fluctuating 

part. As done in Section 2 we impose that the cylindrical component of the pressure is a monotonic 

function  nearby  the  rational  surface: 

= 0 .  Taking  the  radial  derivative  of  (A3)  at  the

this  is  possible  only  if  dp/dΨ=0  for  r=rs

we get a constant pressure, and the equilibrium becomes force free:

Th function µ(r,ζ) generalizes the cylindrical parameter σ(r) defined in Section 2. From  ∇ ⋅ J = 0  
we get B ⋅ ∇µ= 0 , so µ=µ(Ψ). To this function we can apply the same conditions (A2, A3) and get

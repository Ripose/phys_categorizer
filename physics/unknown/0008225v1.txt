Abstract.    The electric field of a point charge moving with constant velocity is derived
using the symmetry properties of Maxwell's equations - its Lorentz invariance. In contrast
to  conventional  treatments,  the  derivation  presented  does  not  use  retarded  integrals  or
relativistic relations.

     We are interested in a simple and consistent derivation of the electromagnetic filed generated by
an  electric  charge  moving  with  constant  velocity.  The  standard  textbook  method  of  derivation  is
commonly based on relativistic transformations of fields. The whole case looks such as if classical
electrodynamics is incomplete and needs external facilities in order to derive some of its formulas.
Really, of course, electrodymanics is a consistent theory and all necessary relations can be obtained
from  Maxwell’s  equations  without  recourse  to  extraneous  postulates.  Recently  Prof.  Jefimenko
demonstrated that in a series of works. However, the  method proposed below  is  more simple and
natural than that expounded in [1].
     The  symmetry  properties  of  electromagnetic  systems  are  constantly  accentuated.  An  even  a
whole theory is based on them – special relativity. However, then it is needed, they don’t use them.
It  may  indicate  that  the  authors  considering  electromagnetism  and  relativity  frequently  don’t
understand properly the subject, which they deal with.  In this connection I would like to emphasize
another time that the primary destination of the symmetry is to alleviate resolution of the equations.
     The starting point in our approach is the wave equations for electromagnetic potentials  A  and j

     Now,  we  must  resolve  equations  (1),  (2)  and  then  using  (3)  get  the  necessary  formulas.  We
consider the special case of the source functions: with the charge density

and the current density

where 
the form

. That implies the time-dependence of the  electromagnetic  potentials  also  having

   and   

(

With this one may take advantage of the symmetry properties of the left-hand side of the equations
(1), (2). The basic fact is that the left-hand side of the inhomogeneous d’Alambert equation

is  Lorentz-invariant.  However,  we  do  not  need  the  whole  Lorentz  invariance  for  our  purposes.
Insofar as we are searching the solution in the form 
 , let us pass to the coordinate frame
moving  with  the  velocity  v   along  the 
1x   axis.  This  can  be  done  using  the  half-Lorentz

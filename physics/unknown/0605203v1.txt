Abstract.  We  show  that  relativistic  dynamics  can  be  approached  without  using 
conservation laws (conservation of momentum, of energy and of the centre of mass). 
Our approach avoids collisions that are not easy to teach without mnemonic aids. The 
derivations are based on the principle of relativity and on its direct consequence, the 
addition law of relativistic velocities.

Einstein’s dynamics teaches us that the momentum of a particle is 

0m  represents the same Newtonian mass, relativists calling it 
where as we see 
rest mass, which accounts for the inertia of the particle at the moment when 
its  acceleration  starts  from  a  state  of  rest.  Relativists  also  introduce  the 
concept of relativistic mass

The  art  of  the  one  teaching  the  relativistic  dynamics  consists  in  offering  a 
justification  for  (3),(4),(5)  and  (6)  which  have  a  very  good  experimental 
confirmation. The job is done in different ways: 
(1)  Requiring  momentum  conservation  in  all  inertial  reference  frames  for 
collisions1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. However, teaching relativistic dynamics by this way 
without mnemonic aids is not an easy task. 
(2)  Involving  plane  electromagnetic  waves  or  photons  in  the  derivations. 
Classical  electrodynamics  teaches  us  that  that  a  plane  electromagnetic  wave 
carries energy  E  and momentum  p related by 

E
2c

 

p

=

c

. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(8) 

In  Einstein’s  thought  experiment,  a  body  at  rest  in  a  given  inertial  reference 

frame  simultaneously  emits  a  plane  electromagnetic  wave  of  energy 

  at  an 

E
2

angle  φ  with  the  OX  axis  and  another  plane  electromagnetic  wave  of  equal 
energy  in  the  opposite  direction12.  A  similar  approach  is  followed  by  other 
authors13,14. 
(3) As a result of guesswork or genial intuition, Einstein replaced the classical 
expression of the momentum  
dx

with

where  τd   represents  the  proper  (or  “wristwatch”  time).  Because  in 
accordance with the time dilation effect

If  an  alert  student  would  ask  why  we  do  that,  it  is  not  easy  to  find  out  a 
satisfactory answer15,16. 
(4) Many papers are devoted to the derivation of the mass-energy equivalence. 
The  derivations 
involve  the  concept  of  force  and  the  work  energy 
theorem17,18,19. 
(5)  Using  the  four  vectors  approach.  It  operates  with  the  concept  of  proper 
time and proper mass. As we will show later on, the approach we propose leads 
in a natural way to the components of a four vector20,21.

The derivation of (5) does not involve conservation laws. Tsai22 derives it 
considering  a  thought  experiment  using  a  balance  whose  arm  length  can  be 
varied  in  order  to  prove  that  both  inertial  masses  of  a  moving  body  obey  the 
relationship  (5)  within  the  scope  of  the  special  theory  of  relativity.  The 
derivation  involves  the  first  principle  (a  balance  in  equilibrium  in  a  given 
inertial  reference  frame  is  in  the  same  state  in  all  other  inertial  reference 
frames)  and  the  composition  law  of  relativistic velocities.  Equation  (5)  is  also 
the  consequence  of  a  Bucherer  type  experiment,  putting  in  accordance  the 
experimental  results  with  the  expected  results  on  the  basis  of  classical 
dynamics23. 
 
 
 
The inertial reference frames we involve are K(XOY) and K’(X’O’Y’). The 
 
corresponding axes of the two reference frames are parallel to each other and 
the  OX(O’X’)  are  common.  At  the  origin  of  time  in  the  two  frames  (
) 
the origins O and O’ are located at the same point in space. Reference frame 
K’ moves with constant velocity V in the positive direction of the common axes. 
Consider  a  particle  that  moves  with  velocity 
relative  to  K  and  with

relative to K’. At

 the particle goes through the point 
where the origins O and O’ of the two frames are located. When detected from 
K the particle moves along a direction that makes an angle θ with the positive 
direction of the OX axis given by 

t

Equations (15) and (16) represent the addition law of relativistic velocities and 
are  usually  derived  using  the  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations  for  the  space-
time coordinates of the same event24. We can derive them even without using 
the Lorentz-Einstein transformations.25,26,27,28  The angles θ and θ′  are related

The  inverse  transformation  can  be  obtained  by  changing  in  the  equations 
derived  above  the  corresponding  primed  physical  quantities  with  un-primed 
ones and changing the sign of V. Equations (15) and (16) enable us to construct 
the following relativistic identities

In  our  derivations  we  will  exploit  the  fact  that  (19),(20)  and  (21)  remain 
identities  if  we  multiply  both  their  sides  by  an  invariant  physical  quantity 
(proper time, proper mass). 
The  purpose  of  our  paper  is  to  show  that  the  relativistic  dynamics 
 
could  be  approached  without  using  conservation  of  momentum,  of 
relativistic mass (energy) or of the centre of mass but by using instead the 
composition law of relativistic velocities.

Physicists,  as  well  trained  godfathers,  find  out  names  for  the  physical 
quantities in the brackets, in concordance with theirs physical dimensions, and 
recover the transformation equations derived above.

5. Involving the photon 
 
As  we  have  mentioned  above,  many  relativistic  dynamics  derivations 
 
involve  the  photon,  a  particle  that  exists  only  moving  with  the  invariant 
velocity  c.  Electrodynamics  teaches  us,  without  involving  special  relativity, 
that  an  electromagnetic  wave,  propagating  in  empty  space,  carries  energy  E

both  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  common  OX(O’X’)  axes.  We  present  in  
Table  1  the  transformation  equations  that  relate  the  physical  quantities 
introduced  in  order  to  describe  the  motion  of  the  bullet  (tardyon)  and  of  the 
photon in K and in K’ respectively.

As  we  see,  the  transformation  factors  that  perform  the  transformation  in  the 
case  of  the  photon  are  the  limits  for  u’=c  of  the  factors  that  perform  the 
transformation in the case of the tardyon. 
Considering an acoustic wave detected from K and from K’ respectively,

equations  that  describe  the  behaviour  of  a  tardyon  to  the  behaviour  of  a

Conclusions 
 
 
We  have  presented  an  approach  to  relativistic  dynamics  that  avoids 
conservation  laws  (conservation  of  momentum,  conservation  of  relativistic 
mass (energy) and conservation of the centre of mass) and collisions, which are 
not  easy  to  teach  at  the  blackboard  without  using  mnemonic  aids.  Our 
approach  also  avoids  the  concept  of  force  and  the  kinetic  energy  theorem.  It 
implies a single scenario (a particle that moves along a given direction with the 
common  OX(O’X’)  axes  and  avoids  ad-hoc    assumptions  at  different  points  of 
the derivation.  
 
Evaluating  the  outcome  of  a  lecture  we  should  take  into  account  the 
time invested and the understanding achieved. We consider that our approach 
satisfies both conditions.

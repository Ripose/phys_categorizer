Abstract

The use of ultrafast pump-probe conductivity  (PPC)  for studies  of photoelectron

dynamics in nonpolar molecular liquids has been based upon the  perturbation  of geminate

recombination  dynamics  of  trapped  electrons  by  their  laser  photoexcitation  into  the

conduction  band.  Such  a  method  is  unsuitable  for  the  studies  of  electron  trapping

dynamics  of  quasifree  electrons  per  se.  We  demonstrate  that  the  PPC  method  can  be

extended to  study  such dynamics, provided that  the  time resolution of  the  conductivity
setup  is better  than  the  ratio  µτ µ

s  of the  mobility-lifetime product  for  the  quasifree

e

e

electron and the mobility  µ

s of the  trapped  electron. For  some liquids (e.g., supercritical

CO2) this  time is sufficiently long (> 100 ns)  and  the  standard  conductivity  equipment

can be used. Even if the time resolution cannot be increased (due to  the  adverse effect on

the  sensitivity),  the  trapping  dynamics  can  be  studied  provided  that  the  trapping

competes with cross  recombination of quasifree electrons with  holes in the  solvent bulk.

Since  the  mobility  of  these  quasifree  electrons  is  very  large  (10-103  cm2/Vs),  this

recombination is facile even when the density of ionization events is fairly low (< 1 µM).

Perturbation  of the  geminate  electron-hole  dynamics  is  not  required  for  this  method  to

work.

1. Introduction

The  injection  of  electron  into  a  molecular  liquid,  by  photoionization  of  the

solvent/solute molecules or electron photodetachment  from an anion or metallic cathode,
− ,  is  generated  in  the

results  in the  familiar scenario:  [1,2]  First,  a  quasifree  electron,  eqf

conduction  band  of  the  liquid.  Then,  this  electron  is  thermalized  and  localized  by  the

solvent. The nature of the resulting species depends on the nature of the  liquid. In liquids

whose constituent molecules have no electron affinity  and no accessible 2p-orbitals (such

as ammonia, water,  alcohols, ethers,  amines,  and  saturated  hydrocarbons),  the  so-called

solvated (cavity) electrons are generated. These species are s-orbital electrons localized in

the  interstices between the  solvent molecules; the  sharing of the  excess  electron  density

by these molecules is minor. In molecular liquids whose  molecules have positive  electron

affinity,  i.e.,  in  most  organic  liquids,  the  electrons  attach  to  one  or  several  molecules

forming monomer or multimer solvent anions (e.g., C6F6 [3] and CS2 [4]).

In water,  the  quasifree electron localizes very  rapidly,  in ca. 50  fs,  [5]  and  fully

stabilizes in < 1 ps, [5-14] forming a solvated electron with the energy ca. 2 eV below the

mobility edge of the  conduction  band.  Such  an  outcome  is  typical  for  other  hydrogen-

bonded polar liquids. For other liquids, more than one kind of negative charge carrier may

coexist shortly  after the  ionization. In  saturated  hydrocarbons,  the  electrons  in  shallow

traps are so close in energy to  the  mobility edge of the  liquid (ca. 100-200 meV) [2] that
−  is

thermal emission from these states into the conduction band readily occurs; that  is,  eqf

in  rapid  equilibrium  with  these  states.  [2]  A  solvent  molecule  can  also  be  a  reversible

electron  trap:  e.g.,  in  benzene  and  toluene  (ArH),  the  quasifree  electron  rapidly

equilibrates with the molecular anion (ArH-): [2,15]

In pressurized  aromatic  liquids,  rxn.  (1)  is  shifted  to  the  right,  and  the  resulting  anion

migrates  ca.  10  times  faster  than  any  other  ions  in  these  liquids,  by  resonant  charge

hopping. [15] Faster-than-diffusion hopping has also been observed for solvent anions in

other liquids, such as SF6, [16] C6F6, [3] CS2, [4] and supercritical CO2. [17,18,19] This

hopping  would  be  impossible  without  sharing  of  the  negative  charge  between  several

solvent molecules, i.e., the  electron  in  these  liquids  rapidly  samples  different  molecular

clusters. [1] The electron involved in the equilibria similar to  rxn. (1) does not  have to  be

quasifree: In liquid acetonitrile, the  dimer solvent  anion  CH CN3

  exists  in  equilibrium

(

)−

with the cavity electron; [20] in liquid (CH3)2S, the  anion and the  cavity  electron coexist

on the subnanosecond time scale. [21]

So far, most  of the  ultrafast  studies  have been carried out  for electrons  in  water,

[5-14,22-25]  alcohols,  [26]  and  ethers.  [27,28]  Pump-probe  transient  absorption  (TA)

spectroscopy was the main experimental approach. Solvation and geminate recombination

dynamics  of  localized  electrons  [6-14,25]  and  relaxation  dynamics  of  photoexcited

solvated  electrons  were  investigated  in  these  liquids.  [14]  Molecular  dynamics  models

have been developed [29-34] and the  details of electron dynamics are gradually becoming

understood.  The  progress in ultrafast  TA  studies  of nonpolar  liquids,  such  as  saturated

hydrocarbons,  has  been  less  spectacular,  [35-41]  one  of  the  reasons  being  that  the

photoexcitation of such  liquids  typically  yields  long-lived  excited  states  of  the  solvent

molecules as the ionization by-product,  and these  states  are frequently  much better  light

absorbers than  the  electrons.  Indeed,  trapped/solvated  electron  in  these  liquids  tend  to

absorb in the near- and mid-IR regions, a spectral region  which has only  recently become

routinely  accessible  to  ultrafast  spectroscopy.  With  a  few  exceptions,  [43,44]  the

research  agenda  was  limited  to  the  studies  of  recombination  dynamics  of  fully

solvated/trapped  electrons.  Even  that  limited  goal  was  difficult  to  attain:  The  initial

picosecond studies of the photoionization  of saturated  hydrocarbons  (e.g., ref [40]) were

often inadequate since the TA signal was dominated by the  solvent excited states.  One of

the  strategies for overcoming this  problem  was  to  use  ultrafast  mid-IR  [41]  and  far-IR

(THz)  spectroscopy.  [43]  With  the  letter  technique,  it  is  possible  to  directly  observe

Drude-like quasifree electrons. Another  approach  (which is only  suitable  for  thin  liquid

layers  on metal surface) was  to  use  ultrafast  pump-probe  photoelectron  spectroscopy.

[44] Yet another approach was to  use ultrafast  pump-probe  conductivity  (PPC).  [38,39]

The  latter  technique  provides  a  means  to  selectively  detect  charged  species.  There  is,

actually, a close similarity between PPC  and the  more familiar 3-pulse  TA  spectroscopy

practiced by Barbara and coworkers [14] and Schwartz and coworkers. [28] In the  latter

method, the change in the  fraction of electrons that  escape geminate recombination ("free

electrons") induced by  electron-detrapping laser pulse  is observed by  TA  spectroscopy,

whereas using the PPC it is observed through the dc conductivity.

2. 

PPC  method 

for  studies  of  geminate  recombination 

in  saturated

hydrocarbons.

For geminate pairs in saturated hydrocarbons, pump-probe  conductivity  was  first

demonstrated by  Braun and Scott  [38] and  further  developed  by  Lukin  and  coworkers.

The  resulting "hot"  electron rapidly  thermalizes, reaching  the  bottom  of  the  conduction

band, and localizes on the subpicosecond time scale:

The  rapid  migration  of  short-lived  "hot"  and  quasifree  electrons  changes  the  spatial

distribution  of  trapped  electrons  around  their  parent  holes.  That,  in  turn,  changes  the

yield of free electrons which escape the  Coulomb field of their geminate partner.  The  IR

pulse  is  delayed  relative  to  the  ionization  UV  pulse,  and  the  increase  in  the  relative
conductivity signal from the free electrons is plotted against this delay time τ.

eq. (4) is 0.35-0.5, [38] and the net conductivity increases after the  IR photoexcitation of

the trapped electron.

The PPC method considered above is possible in two  extreme situations:  (i) when

the electron is trapped extremely rapidly and irreversibly (as in water and alcohols) [5-16]

and (ii) when the  solvated/trapped  electron  is  in  a  rapid  equilibrium  with  the  quasifree

electron (as  in  saturated  hydrocarbons).  As  mentioned  in  section  1,  in  some  molecular

liquids quasifree electrons undergo rapid trapping,  but  the  time scale of this  trapping  can

be slower than  the  geminate recombination dynamics of this  electron. Below we analyze

the PPC experiment in such a situation. The  experimental realization of this  technique on

the  picosecond  time  scale  is  considered  elsewhere;  on  the  slower  time  scale  (for

conversion of the solvent anion to  a solute  anion), a similar method was  demonstrated in

ref. [17]. To understand this method, it is appropriate to give a specific example.

3. Electron dynamics in liquid-like supercritical CO2.

short (10-12 nm). [17,18] For  ρ ρ

 times less mobile than

c

−   (µs  ca.  0.016  cm2/Vs);  nevertheless,  it  has  2-10  times  higher  mobility  than  solute

anions.  [17,19]  The  electron  photodetachment  spectrum  of 

this  solvent  anion

corresponds  to  a  bound-to-free  transition  with  an  onset  at  1.76  eV.  [17,18]  The  large

binding energy (ca. 1.6±0.2 eV) [17] suggests that the negative charge is shared by  several

solvent molecules and migrates by  ultrafast  hopping.  [1,17] The  existence of a relatively

long-lived quasifree electron in sc-CO2 is surprising as it  is  known  [19,46]  that  in  low-

rate.  Apparently,  for  ρ ρ>

c ,  when  the  solvent  conduction  band  emerges,  the  electron

dynamics is quite different from that for  ρ ρ<
c .

It  is easy  to  see that  the  PPC  method based on the  perturbation  of the  geminate

dynamics via the  photoprocess  similar to  rxn. (2) cannot  be  used  to  study  the  electron

dynamics in sc-CO2. The  time constant  for the  geminate  recombination  is  given  by  the

dynamics of quasifree electrons in sc-CO2 would require femtosecond  pulses.  The  main

problem,  however,  is  that  these  quasifree  electrons  are  very  poor  light  absorbers

everywhere  except  for  the  far  IR.  Only  anions  (or  trapped  electrons)  can  be  readily

photoexcited by  a short  laser pulse,  and these  species  are  generated  when  the  geminate

recombination is nearly complete. Such a situation  may  occur in other  liquids where  the

mobility of quasifree electron is high and its trapping time is relatively long.

4. 

PPC method applied to the electron trapping.

While the photon  induced perturbation  of the  geminate dynamics in systems  like

sc-CO2 is difficult, the  PPC  method can still be used provided  that  (i)  the  conductivity

signal is acquired in a time-resolved fashion and/or (ii) the density of the  ionization events

is sufficiently high so that some quasifree electrons decay by homogeneous recombination

with holes in the solvent bulk. Given that  these  quasifree electrons are extremely mobile,

this density does not have to be excessively high: e.g., in pulse  radiolysis of sc-CO2, such

cross recombination was observed, albeit indirectly, when the  electron concentration was

in the micromolar range. [18] As for the  time resolution, it  does not  have to  be femto- or

pico-  seconds,  as  the  only  requirement  to  the  conductivity  setup  is  the  possibility  to
−   (that  follows  the

distinguish  between  the  prompt  conductivity  signal  from  eqf

convolution of the excitation pulse with the response  function of the  conductivity  setup)

and the long-lived conductivity  signal from the  anions. Specifically, the  response  time of
the detection system should be several times shorter than  µτ µ

s . For  sc-CO2, this  ratio

e

e

is  ca.  150  ns,  and  a  time  resolution  of  a  few  nanoseconds,  which  is  quite  standard  in

photoconductivity  studies,  [17,20] is more than  adequate. This  situation  is illustrated in

Fig. 1, where the "spike"-like prompt signal from quasifree electron generated by  the  248

nm pulse  (used for  photoionization)  and/or  532  nm  pulse  (used  to  detach  the  electron

from the  solvent  anion)  is  readily  time  resolved  against  the  background  of  the  weaker,

long-lived conductivity  signal from the  solvent anions. In the  PPC  experiments of Lukin

and coworkers, [39] the typical  load resistance of the  conductivity  cell was  1-2 GΩ  and

the time resolution was in the  millisecond range. The  high impedance made it  possible  to

detect picomolar concentrations of the  charge carriers; however, this  high sensitivity  was

offset  by  inferior  time  resolution.  However,  for  the  measurement  of  the  free  electron

yield, time resolution is not required.

Consider the simplest model in which a quasifree electron with the  lifetime  τ

mobility  µ

will assume that  the  geminate stage is much shorter  than  τ

while the concentration  A t

where  E0   is  the  initial  concentration  of  the  (free)  electrons.  The  prompt  conductivity

The obvious deficiency of this method is that  improvement in the  time resolution

of  the  detection  system  can  only  be  made  by  lowering  the  sensitivity.  That,  in  turn,

requires higher concentration  of  the  photogenerated  species.  As  discussed  above,  cross

recombination of quasifree electrons might then  become a concern. The  surprising fact is
that  for  φ<< 1,  the  same  eqs.  (19)  and  (20)  are  obtained  even  when  this  cross

i.e., the  relative change in the  long-lived conductivity  signal  follows  the  same  formation
kinetics  A τ( ) as the  quantities given by  eqs. (19) and (20). This  long-lived conductivity

signal can be sampled using high-impedance conductivity  cells, in the  same fashion as in

the PPC experiments of Lukin and coworkers [39] and Braun and Scott. [38]

5.  Conclusion.

It is shown that pump-probe photoconductivity method can be  extended to  study

electron-trapping  dynamics  in  nonpolar  molecular  liquids,  provided  that  the  time
resolution  of  the  conductivity  setup  is  better  than  the  ratio  µτ µ

s   of  the  mobility-

e

e

lifetime product  for the  quasifree electron and  the  mobility  µ

s  of  the  trapped  electron.

For  some liquids, this  time is sufficiently long (e.g., ca. 150 ns  in supercritical  CO2,  see

section 3) to  use  the  standard  low-impedance  photoconductivity  cells.  In  the  situation

when  the  time  resolution  cannot  be  increased  (due  to  the  adverse  effect  on  the

sensitivity), the electron trapping dynamics can still be studied provided that the trapping

competes  with  the  recombination of electrons and holes in the  solvent  bulk.  Given  that

the  mobility of  quasifree  electrons  is  very  large  (10-103  cm2/Vs),  this  recombination  is

facile even when the density of the ionization events is relatively low. Perturbation  of the

geminate electron-hole dynamics is not needed for this PPC method.

Laser-induced  d.c.  conductivity  observed  from  0.1  mM  benzene  in  liquid-like  sc-CO2
( ρ= 0.83 g/cm3,  T =41oC);  after  ref.  [17].  Benzene  was  photoionized  using  a  248  nm

laser pulse  (L2; 16 ns  fwhm); the  solvent anion was  subsequently  photoexcited  using  a

532 nm, 5 ns fwhm laser pulse (L2; 5 ns fwhm). Kinetics obtained for two  delay times of

the  532  nm  pulse  are  shown.  The  "spikes"  observed  during  the  248  nm  and  532  nm

photoexcitation  are  from  quasifree  electrons  generated  by  biphotonic  ionization  of  the

solute end electron photodetachment from the solvent anion, respectively. The area of the

"spike" in this plot gives the quantity  Sp  given by  eq. (12). The  slow  conductivity  signal

σ

i  is from solvent anions. The time profile of the  "spike"  follows the  time profile of the

excitation laser convoluted with the response function of the conductivity setup.

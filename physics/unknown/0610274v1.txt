Abstract 

 

We demonstrate phase and frequency stabilization of a diode laser at the thermal 

noise limit of a passive optical cavity.  The system is compact and exploits a cavity 

design that reduces vibration sensitivity.  The sub-Hz laser is characterized by 

comparison to a second independent system with similar fractional frequency stability (1 

x 10-15 at 1 s).  The laser is further characterized by resolving a 2 Hz wide, ultranarrow 

optical clock transition in ultracold strontium.

Highly frequency-stabilized lasers are essential in high resolution spectroscopy 

and quantum measurements [1], optical atomic clocks [2,3], and quantum information 

science [4].  To achieve superior stability with high bandwidth control, the laser output is 

traditionally servo locked to a highly isolated passive optical cavity using the Pound-

Drever-Hall (PDH) technique [5].  Typical limits to the resulting laser stability include 

vibration-induced cavity length fluctuation, photon detection shot noise, and thermal-

mechanical noise of the passive cavity components [6,7].  By thoughtful system design, 

the relative impact of these noise contributions can be adjusted.  Here we report a cavity-

laser system that achieves high stability with an appropriate compromise between 

acceleration sensitivity and thermal noise.   The compact, cavity-stabilized diode laser 

has a sub-Hz linewidth (at several seconds) and is thermal-noise-limited to fractional 

instability of ~1 x 10-15 at time scales of 0.5 to 300 s.  As further evidence of the laser’s 

optical stability, we use it to interrogate an ultranarrow optical atomic transition in neutral 

atomic strontium. We resolve an optical transition linewidth of ~2 Hz, the narrowest 

optical atomic resonance observed to date.  

The laser source in this work is a diode laser in an external cavity (ECDL) in the 

Littman configuration operating at 698 nm [Fig. 1(a)].  The laser is first pre-stabilized to 

a simple optical cavity with finesse of ~10,000.  The PDH stabilization is accomplished 

via feedback to the laser diode current and the laser cavity piezo transducer (PZT).  The 

servo bandwidth is 2–3 MHz.  The prestabilized laser light is first-order diffracted by an 

acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and fiber-coupled to a platform on which an ultrastable 

cavity resides.  This platform is mounted on a commercially available passive vibration 

isolation unit ([8], resonant frequency 0.5-1 Hz).  Both the platform and the isolation unit 

 

2

are within a temperature-controlled enclosure lined with acoustic-damping foam.  On the 

platform, the prestabilized laser light is phase modulated by an electro-optic modulator 

(EOM) operating at 5 MHz.  Approximately 10 µW of optical power is incident on the 

ultrastable cavity for PDH locking.  Stabilization to this cavity is accomplished via 

feedback to the AOM and a PZT controlling the prestabilization cavity length.  The servo 

bandwidth for this final locking stage is ~100 kHz. The useful output of the laser is 

delivered via a fiber port located near the ultrastable cavity on the same platform.  The 

entire optical set up occupies less than 1 m3.  

The ultrastable cavity has a finesse of 250,000 and is 7 cm long (cavity linewidth 

of ~7 kHz).  Both the spacer and the optically bonded mirror substrates are made of 

ultralow expansion glass (ULE).  To maintain small sensitivity of cavity length to 

acceleration, we implemented the following design features.  First, because the 

acceleration sensitivity of fractional cavity length scales with the cavity length, we chose 

a somewhat short cavity spacer (7 cm) [9].  Second, the cavity is held at its midplane to 

achieve symmetric stretching and compressing of the two halves of the cavity during 

acceleration to suppress vibration sensitivity [9,10,11].  The cavity is mounted vertically 

to exploit the intuitive symmetry in the vertical direction [see Fig. 1(b)]. This mounting is 

accomplished by a monolithically attached midplane ring resting on three Teflon rods.  

Third, the cavity is wider in the middle and tapered at the ends, allowing more rigid 

construction without excess material.  This cavity was designed in our laboratory and 

constructed in conjunction with a dozen other quantum metrology laboratories around the 

world.  It is now commercially available, facilitating 1 Hz laser stabilization to any 

interested research lab [12].  The cavity and supporting rods are held in vacuum (10-6 

 

3

torr) by an ion pump (2 l/s); the cavity spacer has symmetric evacuation holes 

perpendicular to the optical axis.  The vacuum can is single point temperature controlled 

to ~305 K within 500 µK over a 24 hour period.  Since the ion pump is not temperature 

controlled, we installed a blackbody radiation baffle between the vacuum can and the ion 

pump.  

To evaluate the final laser stability, a second cavity-laser system was constructed 

with a separate diode laser and a separate ultrastable cavity mounted on an independent 

vibration isolation platform in an independent enclosure.  Light was transferred from one 

system to the other via optical fiber (employing fiber-phase-noise cancellation [13]) and a 

heterodyne beat between the two stabilized lasers was detected (Fig. 2 inset).  Linear 

drifts of ≤ 1 Hz/s of the heterodyne beat were removed by applying a feedforward linear 

correction to reduce the drift to less than 50 mHz/s.  At 300 mHz resolution bandwidth 

(RBW), the laser linewidth is 400 mHz wide (full width at half maximum).  By reducing 

the RBW to 150 mHz, linewidths of 220 mHz can be observed with nonnegligible power 

in low-frequency noise sidebands.  The fractional linewidth is below 1 x 10-15.  The 

stability of one of the lasers as measured by the fractional Allan deviation is also shown 

in Fig. 2.  This measurement was taken directly by counting the heterodyne beat under 

linear drift cancellation.  The theoretical estimate of the thermal-noise-limited stability is 

indicated as a solid line in the figure.   This thermal noise limit has nearly negligible 

contribution from the ULE spacer itself, while the contribution from the ULE mirror 

substrates is approximately 1.5 times that from the dielectric high-reflective coating [6].  

Except for a small noise bump at 100 s, the laser stability from 0.5 to 300 s coincides 

precisely with the modeled thermal noise limit. 

 

4

Laser phase coherence was also observed via time domain measurements.  The 

heterodyne beat at ~200 MHz between the two laser systems was mixed down to 15 Hz.  

This 15 Hz signal and its sine wave fit are shown in Fig. 3(a), with a linear chirp to 

account for the simple residual linear drift between the two lasers.  The fit shows that the 

lasers remain phase coherent within 1 rad at the optical frequency of ~4 x 1014 Hz for a 

period > 2 s.  

The sensitivity of the cavity length to accelerations was measured by shaking the 

cavity and observing the additional frequency noise present on the laser tightly locked to 

the cavity resonance.  This was also an optical heterodyne measurement, with the system 

that was not shaken serving as the reference oscillator.  The vertical acceleration 

sensitivity was measured to be 30 kHz/m/s2.  The horizontal acceleration sensitivity was 

20 kHz/m/s2 at 5 Hz; it dropped to 5 kHz/m/s2 at 15 Hz because of mechanical isolation 

provided by the Teflon cavity mounting posts.  The relatively short cavity used here 

constitutes a compromise between cavity acceleration sensitivity and the fractional 

thermal noise contributions (from the mirrors) to the cavity length stability.  This 

compromise facilitates impressive diode laser stability at the 10-15 level with relatively 

straightforward vibration isolation.  The difference in performance between this system 

and that of the highest recorded stability is consistent with the difference in cavity length 

that scales the fractional thermal noise [14,6].   

To see this compromise more quantitatively, Fig. 3(b) shows the laser frequency 

noise spectrum.  Below 5 Hz, the laser noise is dominated by thermal noise.  Also shown 

is the laser noise contribution due to cavity acceleration—this is simply the measured 

acceleration noise spectrum on the vibration isolation platform scaled by the empirically 

 

5

determined acceleration sensitivity given above.  This contribution to laser noise is 

dominated by vertical sensitivity because the vertical acceleration spectral density greatly 

exceeds the horizontal.   The thermal noise contributes roughly a factor of 2 to 4 more 

than the acceleration noise. Consequently, the system could be further improved by using 

similar, but longer, mounted optical cavities together with fine tuning of the symmetrical 

rejection of acceleration sensitivity [9].  In this case, the combined thermal and 

acceleration noise contributions can be kept small enough for laser fractional frequency 

stability at the low side of the 10-16 decade. 

To further characterize the laser coherence properties, we used one of the stable 

698 nm lasers to probe an ultranarrow, doubly forbidden optical clock transition (1S0-3P0 , 

natural linewidth ~1 mHz) in atomic strontium [15].  We probed a collection of laser-

cooled Sr atoms trapped in an optical lattice at a temperature of 2 µK.  Atom 

interrogation was performed in the Lamb-Dicke regime where both Doppler and recoil 

effects were eliminated.  The recovered optical atomic transition is shown in Fig. 4.  The 

linewidth of 2 Hz is the narrowest optical atomic transition observed to date (line quality 

factor Q > 2 x 1014).  This linewidth corresponds closely to the Fourier limit given by the 

probe pulse duration (480 ms).  Such a spectrum requires 20–30 s overall scanning time.  

The heterodyne beat between the two stabilized lasers integrated over 30 s reveals a 

single laser linewidth of ~2 Hz, suggesting that laser stability is the limiting factor in 

observing the narrow spectra.  This atomic measurement provides a clean, independent 

confirmation of overall laser performance. 

We have demonstrated a simple, compact, and ultrastable laser system useful for 

high precision metrology, quantum measurements, and quantum information applications, 

 

6

all of which require long atom-light coherence times.  With the recent success of optical-

lattice-based clocks in observing very high line Q with large atom numbers [15,16], the 

fundamental quantum projection noise of such systems can allow for 1 s instabilities at 1 

x 10-17, achievable only if laser stability can further improve to permit observation of 

narrower atomic spectra.  Consequently, future progress in this field requires pushing 

lasers to even higher stability.   This requires improving the thermal noise limitation of 

passive optical cavities.  As discussed in the literature [6,7,11], this can be done in three 

ways: (1) lower temperatures, (2) longer cavities, and (3) substrate and dielectric coating 

materials with lower mechanical loss.  While technical challenges exist for any of these, 

the approach demonstrated here is compatible with each of these three routes to 

improvement.

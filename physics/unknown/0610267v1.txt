Introduction

In recent years, laser-plasma accelerators have gained

more ground on becoming a promising alternative to con-

ventional large scale particle acceleration facilities based on

if technology. In laser generated wakefields, the electrons

can experience accelerating fields of several hundred GV/m

This exceeds the fields of conventional accelerators by

several

orders

of magnitude.

Thus,

laser-plasma

accelerators

can generate high-energy particles over

distances of only a few hundred micrometers. Electron

energies of more than 300 MeV have been achieved in

experiments .Generally,

the generated electron beams

exhibit a broad exponential spectrum and large divergence.

Recent experiments have, however, demonstrated the

capability of

laser-plasma accelerators to produce quasi-

monoenergetic and well-collimated electron bunches. This

constitutes a major advance towards die application of laser-

plasma accelerators to high-energy physics, biology, or

medicine.

Scaling laws provide a very simple, even simplistic approach to

understanding the very small systems: nuclei and nanoparticles.

Detailed understanding

requires sophisticated model

dependent

calculations. But basic scaling law calculations, used with appropriate

care, can show why the very small systems have a very interesting

properties common for example for nanoparticles and nuclei.

In this paper considering results published in our monograph [1] , we

investigate the scaling of the relaxation times for the nuclei and

nanoparticles with N components- partons.

It is shown that for the

gas of N- partons the relaxation time for the system is scaled as τN→N

τ, where τis the microscopic relaxation time τ= ћ/ m(α c)2

and α is the coupling constant, α=1/137 for the electromagnetic

interactions and 0.16 for strong interaction , c

is the light vacuum

speed

Scaling law in quantum thermal phenomenal

In monograph [1] the quantum description of the quantum thermal

phenomena was presented. It was shown that in the case of the ultra

short laser pulses the heat transport is described by hyperbolic

quantum heat transport equation [1]:

τ ∂2T/∂2t + ∂T/∂t  = DΔT

(2.1)

3

where T denotes the temperature of the parton gas in the system,τis

the relaxation time , m is the parton mass and D is the thermal

diffusion coefficient. The relaxation time τis defined as [1]:

τ=h/mv2

(2.2)

where v is the thermal pulse propagation speed :

v= αi c

(2.3)

In formula (2.3) α i is the coupling constant, α 1 =

1/137 for

electromagnetic interactions and α2 =0.15 for strong interactions, c

denotes the light velocity in vacuum. Both parameters τ and v

completely characterize the thermal energy transport on the atomic

scale and can be named as “microscopic” relaxation time and

“microscopic” heat velocity.

In the following, starting with the microscopic τ and v we

describe thermal relaxation processes in system( nanoparticle or

nuclei) which consist of N partons. To that aim we use the Pauli-

Heisenberg inequality [1 ] :

Δr Δp> N1/3 ћ

(2.4)

4

where N denotes the heat carriers , partons, in structure : electrons in

nanoparticles or nucleons in the nuclei. From formula we conclude that

for the system with N partons we can introduce the effective
Heisenberg constant ћN

ћN= ћN1/3

(2.5)

According to formula (2.5) we recalculate the relaxation time τand

thermal velocity v for system consisting of N partons:

ћN = ћ N1/3

(2.5)

vN=N-1/3 v

(2.6)

τN=N τ

(2.7)

Formula (2.7) describes the scaling for the relaxation time for the

system of N noninteracting partons

Let us assume that system of N partons is heated and

energy

delivered to the system is equal E. As was shown in monograph [6]

the response of the system depends on the value of the ratio K, viz.,

Ki=E/mi(αic )2

(2.8)

For K<1 the heating of the systems can be described as the

thermal diffusion process. For K>1 the transport of the

5

thermal energy contains the wave component [1] In Fig 1

the calculations of the K are presented for the electron gas

and in Fig.2 for the nucleon gas. It is interesting to observe

that for both systems the K=1 is crossed for the nearly the

same value of energy scaled as 106

In Fig.3 the parameter K is calculated as a function of the

λ- wave length of the laser energy. It can be concluded that

for λ < 300nm in electron gas the heat transport contains

the wave component

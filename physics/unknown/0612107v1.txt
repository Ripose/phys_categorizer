Kurchatov squ.,1, Moscow, 123182, Russia 

By method of numerical simulation of heating of a dust conducting particle in homogeneous 

plasma it is shown, that depending on initial temperature of a particle both heating and 

cooling of a particle is possible with formation of two various quasi-stable conditions - 

temperature bistability. The upper condition ("hot") condition corresponds to positive charge 

of a particle whereas the lower ("cold") condition corresponds to negative charge of a 

particle. The method of experimental observation of the effect is proposed.

 Summary 

Introduction 

In the previous works of the author feature of radiating cooling of small conducting particles in 

conditions of the "cutoff" connected with reduction of the sizes of a particle less of wave length of a 

thermal electromagnetic radiation was considered and essential difference from the formula of the 

Stefan - Boltzmann [1, 2] is shown. In the present research influence of electric potential of a 

particle on energy exchange in conditions of homogeneous plasma is added. Effects of energy loss 

in plasma discharge at presence of metal inclusions were investigated in [3]. The effect considered  

in the present work can be of interest for research of behavior of a pellet, thrown in hot plasma in the 

diagnostic purposes [4]. It is shown, that the initial temperature of a particle can define character of 

consequent temperature dynamics of a particle, and under certain conditions results in to occurrence 

of two different quasi-stationary thermal conditions which it is possible to consider as existence of 

temperature bistability. Physically such effect is connected with braking an electronic flow at 

negative charge of a particle and an opportunity of positive charge at elevated temperatures owing to 

thermal electron emission [5, 6]. It is known, that a local warming up of a surface and as

consequence occurrence of strong thermal electron currents can result in such effect as an unipolar 

arch [5]. In case of the isolated particles thermal electron emission leads only to change of a charge 

of a particle. 

Model of process of heating  

Change of potential of a particle under action of electrons and ions of homogeneous 

hydrogen plasma on its surface and the current of thermal electron emission considered under the 

formula of Richardson [5], in approximation of the spherical form is described by the equation (1)

where C - electric capacity of a particle, T - temperature of a dust particle, R - its radius, Te, ne, Ve - 

temperature, density and speed of electrons in plasma (similar sizes with an index i correspond to 

positively charged ions), W – work function of electrons from a surface, A - Richardson's constant 

[5]. Multipliers in square brackets in both equations define braking electrons and positively charged 

ions of plasma at approach to a surface of a particle in view of a sign on a charge of a particle. It is 

supposed, that electrons and ions can only be braked on approach, but not «extracted» from plasma 

as sign on potential of a surface gets changed – it does not work because of Debye screening of 

electric fields of a particle in plasma [7]. 

Time changing of thermal energy of a target in an environment of homogeneous plasma is 

defined by a flow of high energy electrons and ions from plasma to the surface of a particle whereas 

energy losses are caused by the thermal radiation, the evaporation of substance, and also by thermal

where с and Cv - density and heat capacity of substance of a target, у - Stefan-Boltzmann constant, 

H and N - energy of sublimation and density of atoms of a target, Csnd - speed of a sound in 

substance [8]. Besides for simplification of consideration of effects, the radius of a particle was 

assumed to be constant.

It is possible to find potential in this approach from the second equation at stationary value of 

temperature, and then substituting in the first one to calculate time dynamics of temperature of a 

sphere in homogeneous plasma. The method allows to consider also time dependence of parameters 

of plasma under condition of its local homogeneity.  

 

 

Results 

Results of modelling of temperature of the carbon ball thrown in hydrogen plasma with 
density ne = ni = 1013 cm-3 and temperature Te = Ti = 10 eV, at various initial temperatures of a 

surface are shown in a Fig. 1. Coefficients for carbon dust pellet were taken from [9, 10]. Change of 

mass of a ball due to evaporation was not considered. As it is seen from figure, character of change 

of temperature is defined by an initial warming up of a surface of a ball. At initial temperatures T0 ≤ 

3 000 K the temperature of a ball aspires to accept quasistationary value T = 2 600 K. Thus the 

potential of a particle remains negative and is equal       -36.9 V. If initial temperature T0 ≥3 200 K at 

the same parameters of plasma there is a fast warming up of a particle and temperature aspires to 

quasi-stationary value T = 4 760 K and with positive potential + 1.8 V. Though change of the sizes 

of a ball due to evaporation within the frames of the model was not considered, probably 

3 

nevertheless it is possible to speak about realization of two various modes of heating of a particle in 

homogeneous plasma (temperature bistability) - at least the bottom "cold" quasi-equilibrium state 

can be reached in experimental conditions, and rise in temperature up to the top "hot" condition will 

result in to the strengthened evaporation which also can be observed in experiments.  

Dependence of a heat flux on a surface of a particle from plasma on surface temperature at 

various electronic temperatures and density is shown in a Fig. 2. It is seen, that in case of Te = Ti = 

10 eV the sign on a heat flux becomes negative between points 2 600 K ≤  T0 ≤ 3 100 K and then 

one more time at T0 ≥ 4 760 K. Under negative heat flux there will be a cooling of dust particle that 

reflects aspiration of temperature to bottom «quasi-equilibrium» value, that dynamics of temperature 

of particles reflects in a Fig. 1. At lower temperature of plasma Te = Ti = 0.1 and 1.0 eV only bottom 

"cold" condition with temperature 1 000 K - 1 500 K can take place. Dependence of a heat flux on 

surface temperature at various densities of plasma and Te = 10 eV is shown in a Fig. 3. 

Dependence of potential of a target on surface temperature in homogeneous plasma at 

electronic temperatures Te = Ti = 0.1-10 eV and density of electrons and ions ne = ni = 1013 cm-3 is 

shown in a Fig. 4. It is seen that with rise of temperature there a sign of potential of surface of the 

ball changes, caused by thermal electron emission and the temperature at which the potential 

changes a sign, corresponds to position of heap on curve of a heat flux density. 

In a Fig. 5 the contribution of various processes to a heat flux on a surface of a particle in 

homogeneous plasma at electronic temperature Te = 10 eV and is shown for density of electrons and 
ions ne = ni = 1013 cm-3. On the curve 1 all mechanisms of energy transmission are considered, on the 

curve 2 - radiating losses are rejected, on the curve 3 - cooling due to sublimation is rejected as well. 

It is seen, that change of a sign of a heat flux in the region of 3 000 K is connected with radiating 

losses. And the heat losses connected with sublimation of substance of a target become essential at 

temperatures above 4 000 K. Therefore the warming up of a target to a "hot" quasi-stationary state 

will result in evaporation of a target. However the "cold" quasi-stationary state can exist long 

enough time and it is possible to establish an experimental technique on this difference for 

experimental observation of the effect. At lower temperatures of plasma Te ≤ 10 eV the effect of 

bistability is absent and the "cold" mode is realized only.  

Experimentally  the  effect  of  temperature  bistability  of  a  dust  particle  in  plasma  can  be 

observed  by the intensity  of a luminescence of  a  pellet, thrown in  plasma with initial temperature

above or below the threshold. At parameters of plasma when the temperature bistability is possible 

higher temperatures of a particle will result in sharp increase of brightness of a luminescence due to 

evaporation  of  substance  or  on  the  contrary  for  lower  initial  temperatures  no  effect  on  brightness 

when the particle tends to cooling. In case of colder and less dense plasma such threshold effect will 

not be observed.

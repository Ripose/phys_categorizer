Abstract
  A new electrostatic ramjet space engine is proposed and analyzed. The upper atmosphere (85 -1000 
km) is extremely dense in ions (millions per cubic cm). The interplanetary medium contains positive 
protons from the solar wind. A charged ball collects the ions (protons) from the surrounding area 
and a special electric engine accelerates the ions to achieve thrust or decelerates the ions to achieve 
drag.  The thrust may have a magnitude of several Newtons. If the ions are decelerated, the engine 
produces a drag and generates electrical energy. The theory of the new engine is developed. It is 
shown that the proposed engine driven by a solar battery (or other energy source) can not only 
support satellites in their orbit for a very long time but can also work as a launcher of space 
apparatus.  The latter capability includes launch to high orbit, to the Moon, to far space, or to the 
Earth's atmosphere (as a return thruster for space apparatus or as a killer of space debris).  The 
proposed ramjet is very useful in interplanetary trips to far planets because it can simultaneously 
produce thrust or drag and large electric energy using the solar wind. Two scenarios, launch into the 
upper Earth atmosphere and an interplanetary trip, are simulated and the results illustrate the 
excellent possibilities of the new concept. 
  Key words:  Electrostatic ramjet space engine, ramjet space thruster, orbit launcher. Earth orbit space 
propulsion. Interplanetary propulsion, interstellar propulsion, AB-Ramjet space engine.

Introduction
General.  At present, we use only one method of launch for extra-planetary flight that being liquid-
fuel or solid-fuel rockets. This method is very complex, expensive, and dangerous.  
 The current method of flight has reached the peak of its development. In the last 30 years it has not 
allowed cheap delivery of loads to space nor made tourist trips to the cosmos, or even to the upper
atmosphere, affordable. Space flights are very expensive and not conceivable for the average person. 
The main method used for electrical energy separation is photomontage cells. Such solar cells are 
expensive and have low energy efficiency.
The aviation, space, and energy industries need revolutionary ideas which will significantly 
improve the capability of future air and space vehicles. The author has offered a series of new 
ideas1-60 contained in a) numerous patent applications,3 -18 b) manuscripts that have been presented at 
the World Space Congress (WSC)-1992, 199419 -22, the WSC-200223 -32 , and numerous Propulsion 
Conferences,32 -38 and c) other articles.39-59
      In this article a revolutionary method and implementations for future space flights are proposed.
The method uses a highly charged open ball made from thin film which collects space particles 
(protons) from a large area. The proposed propulsion system creates several Newtons of thrust and 
accelerates space apparatus to high speeds. 
    History. The author started closed research in this area as far back as 19651 -2. A series of patent 
applications3 -18 submitted during 1982 -1983 documented several methods and implementations for 
space propulsion and electric generators using solar wind and space particles.  In 1987 these ideas 
were described in Report ESTI16. In 1990 the author published brief information about this topic17

2

(see pp. 67 - 80) and in 1992 -1994 he reported on further research at the World Space Congresses -
1992, 1994, 200219 -32 and his manuscripts 33 -59.
  Brief information about space particles and space environment.  In Earth's atmosphere at 
altitudes between 200 - 400 km (fig. 8), the concentration of ions reaches several million per cubic 
cm. In the interplanetary medium at Earth orbit, the concentration of protons from the Solar Wind 
reaches 3  - 70 particles per cubic cm. In an interstellar medium the average concentration of protons 
is about one particle in 1 cm3, but in the space zones HII (planetary nebulas), which occupy about
5% of interstellar space, the average particle density may be 10 -20 g/cm3. 
   If we can collect these space particles from a large area, accelerate and brake them, we can get the 
high speed and braking of space apparatus and to generate energy,. The author is suggesting the 
method of collection and implementations of it for propulsion and braking systems and electric 
generators. He developed the initial theory of these systems.

Short Description of the Implementation

  A Primary Ramjet propulsion engine is shown in fig.1. Such an engine can work in one charge 
environment.  For example, the surrounding region of space medium contains the positive charge 
particles (protons, ions). The engine has two plates 1, 2, and a source of electric voltage and energy
(storage) 3. The plates are made from a thin dielectric film covered by a conducting layer. As the 
plates may be a net. The source can create an electric voltage U and electric field (electric intensity 
E) between the plates. One also can collect the electric energy from plate as an accumulator. 
  The engine works in the following way. Apparatus are moving (in left direction) with velocity V
(or particles 4 are moving in right direction). If voltage U is applied to the plates, it is well-known 
that main electric field is only between plates. If the particles are charged positive (protons, positive 
ions) and the first and second plate are charged positive and negative, respectively, then the particles 
are accelerated between the plates and achieve the additional velocity v > 0. The total velocity will 
be V+v behind the engine (fig.1a). This means that the apparatus will have thrust T > 0 and spend 
electric energy W < 0 (bias, displacement current). If the voltage U = 0, then v = 0, T = 0, and W = 0 
(fig.1b).
  If the first and second plates are charged negative and positive, respectively, the voltage changes 
sign Assume the velocity v is satisfying  -V < v < 0.   Thus the particles will be braked and the 
engine (apparatus) will have drag and will also be braked. The engine transfers braked vehicle 
energy into electric (bias, displacement) current. That energy can be collected and used. Note that 
velocity v cannot equal  -V.   If  v were equal to  -V, that would mean that the apparatus collected 
positive particles, accumulated a big positive charge and then repelled the positive charged particles.
   If the voltage is enough high, the brake is the highest (fig.1d). Maximum braking is achieved when 
v = -2V  (T < 0, W = 0). Note, the v cannot be more then  -2V, because it is full reflected speed.
   AB-Ramjet engine. The suggested Ramjet is different from the primary ramjet. The suggested 
ramjet has specific electrostatic collector 5 (fig. 2a,c,d,e,f,g). Other authors said the idea of space 
matter collection. But they did not give the principal design of collector. Their electrostatic collector 
cannot work. Really, for charging of collector we must move away from apparatus the charges. The 
charged collector attracts the same amount of the charged particles (charged protons, ions, electrons) 
from space medium. They discharged collector. All your work will be idle. That cannot work.
  The electrostatic collector cannot adsorb a matter (as offered some inventors) because it can adsorb 
ONLY opposed charges particles, which will be discharged the initial charge of collector. Physic 
law of conservation of charges does not allow to change charges of particles.
   The suggested collector and ramjet engine have a special design (thin film, net, special form of 
charge collector, particle accelerator). The collector/engine passes the charged particles ACROSS 
(through) the installation and changes their energy (speed), deflecting and focusing them. That is

3

why we refer to this engine as the AB-Ramjet engine. It can create thrust or drag, extract energy
from the kinetic energy of particles or convert the apparatus' kinetic energy into electric energy, and 
deflect and focus the particle beam.  The collector creates a local environment in space because it 
deletes (repeals) the same charged particles (electrons) from apparatus and allows the Ramjet to 
work when the apparatus speed is close to zero. The author developed the theory of the electrostatic 
collector and published it in [54]. The conventional electric engine cannot work in usual plasma 
without the main part of the AB-engine - the special pervious electrostatic collector.

  The plates of the suggested engine are different from the primary engine. They have a 
concentrically septa (partitions) which create additional radial electric fields (electric intensity) (fig. 
2b). They straighten, deflect and focus the particle beams and improve the efficiency coefficient of 
the engine. 
  The central charge can have a different form (core) and design (fig.2 c,d,e,f,g,h). It may be:
1) a sphere (fig. 2c) having a thin cover of plastic film and a very thin (some nanometers) 

conducting layer (aluminum), with the concentrical spheres inserted one into the other (fig.2d), 

2) a net formed from thin wires (fig. 2e);
3) a cylinder (without butt-end)(fig.2f); or 
4) a plate (fig.2g). 
   The design is chosen to produce minimum energy loss (maximum particle transparency - see 
section "Theory"). The safety (from discharging, emission of electrons) electric intensity in a 
vacuum is 108 V/m for an outer conducting layer and negative charge. The electric intensity is more 
for an inside conducting layer and thousands of times more for positive charge.
  The engine plates are attracted one to the other (see theoretical section). They can have different 
designs (fig.4a - 4d).  In the rotating film or net design (fig.4a), the centrifugal force prevents 
contact between the plates. In the inflatable design (fig. 4b), the low pressure gas prevents plate 
contact. A third design has (inflatable) rods supporting the film or net (fig. 4c). The fourth design is 
an inflatable toroid which supports the distance between plates or nets (fig. 4d).
  Electric gun.  The simplest electric gun (linear particle accelerator) for charging an apparatus ball 
is presented in fig. 4. The design is a long tube (up 10 m) which creates a strong electric field along 
the tube axis (100 MV/m and more). The gun consists of the tube with electrical isolated cylindrical 

4

electrodes, ion source, microwave frequency energy source, and voltage multiplier. This electric gun 
can accelerate charged particles up 1000 MeV. Electrostatic lens and special conditions allow the
creation of a focusing and self-focusing beam which can transfer the charge and energy long 
distances into space. The engine can be charged from a satellite, a space ship, the Moon, or a top 
atmosphere station. The beam may also be used as a particle beam weapon.

 Approximately tens years ago, the conventional linear pipe accelerated protons up to 40 MeV with 
a beam divergence of 10 -3 radian. However, acceleration of the multi-charged heavy ions may result 
in significantly `more energy.

 At present, the energy gradients as steep as 200 GeV/m have been achieved over millimeter-scale 
distances using laser pulsers. Gradients approaching 1 GeV/m are being produced on the multi-
centimeter-scale with electron-beam systems, in contrast to a limit of about 0.1 GeV/m for radio-
frequency acceleration alone. Existing electron accelerators such as SLAC 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLAC> could use electron-beam afterburners to increase the intensity 
of their particle beams. Electron systems in general can provide tightly collimated, reliable beams
while laser systems may offer more power and compactness.

Theory of Space AB-Ramjet propulsion

  
 The main part and innovation of the suggested system is the charged core. That may be a charged 
ball (fig. 2 c,d,e), a cylinder (fig. 2f), or a plate (fig. 2g). The big charge has some problems in 
space. We consider the major problems below.
  1. Blockading of the ball charge (AB-radius).  Blockading of the charge core by unlike particles 
is the main problem with this method. The charge on the core attracts unlike particles and repels like 
particles. The opposite charged particles accumulate near the core and block its charge. As a result, 
the area of ball (charged core) influence is many times less than the area of the interaction of the ball 
and the particles when there is no blockading. The forces are thus greatly reduced. 
    The author of this work proposed two models for estimation of the efficient charge radius, named 
AB-radius (radius of neutral working charge). That radius is analog of the Debaev shield radius for 
single charged particles in plasma theory.  In the first model, the radius of the efficient area is 
computed as the area where particles of like charge to the ball are absent and the density of 
opposite-charged (unlike) particles is the same as the space medium. This model gives the lower 
limit of the efficient area. In the second model, the radius of the efficient area is computed as the 
area where the density of unlike particles is less than the space medium density because the unlike 
particles inside the efficient area have generally higher velocity than a those outside this area. The 
neutral area (neutral sphere) in model 2 is larger than in model 1. Model 2 is better, but this problem 
needs more detailed research.  
   It is possible to find the minimum distance which space electrons can approach a negatively 
charged ball. The full energy of a charged particle (or body) is the sum of the kinetic and potential 
electric energy. Any change of energy equals zero:

4) The AB-radius of the neutral (blocking) sphere can be found from the condition Qr = 0. 
Note. For our estimation we can find it using the stronger condition Qr = 0.5Q, and call it the 
efficiency radius Re of the charge Q. We use the stronger condition because model 2 may yield a 
more accurate result (with the speed Vr being slower).
   The efficiency radius in Model 2 is significantly more than in Model 1. Model 1 gives the lower 
estimation of the efficiency radius; model 2 gives the top (more realistic) estimation of the 
efficiency AB-radius. In our computation we will use the model 2 with the note above.

Fig. 5.   Propulsion coefficient of efficiencies for Ramjet and conventional rocket engine (includes 

conventional electric rocket thrusters) versus relative jet speed.

 As can be seen, the efficiency of the conventional rocket engine seems better than of the AB-
Ramjet. However, full engine efficiency is a product of the propulsion and terminal efficiencies. The 
terminal coefficient of the conventional (liquid) rocket engine is large, with a value of 0.68 (nozzle 
loss), while the terminal coefficient of the conventional rocket electric (ion) thruster is small.  This 
is because the rocket ion thruster spends a lot of energy in the ionization of the jet mass. The 
proposed AB-engine's terminal coefficient depends on a transparency coefficient (discussed later) of 
plates and core and the terminal efficiency can be high. Note that the rocket propulsion having the 
high speed of the jet has low efficiency from an energy viewpoint. The rocket electric thruster with 
high specific impulse (jet speed) spends a significant amount of energy per unit of thrust. The 
photon rocket has top jet speed and the worst energy efficiency. The best efficiency ( 1) is achieved 
by a propulsion system which repels from a very large mass (for example, a planet). Our AB-Ramjet 
engine uses outer space mass. That is very big advantage in comparison to the conventional electric 
thruster and rocket which uses its own mass.

  8) Final relative speed of different propulsion systems. Assume we can covert mass into energy 
and back with an efficiency coefficient of 1. Assume the system coordinate is connected with 
apparatus. Compare the relative fuel consumption.

Fig.6. Expenses of relative mass (energy) versus relative apparatus speed for a different engines: photon 
engine, multi-reflex engine [52] located on the planet surface and located in the apparatus. The AB-Ramjet 
located between multi-reflex engine located on the vehicle and photon engine.  The curve depends from a 
flow of space mass through engine. Transfer efficiency coefficient (mass to energy) equals 1. Computations 
made in system coordinate connected with apparatus. The relativistic effect (for Earth's observer) can change 
these results for high speed. 

  Note that in many ways the AB-Ramjet engine is better than the photon engine (which is a dream 
of all space scientists). For example, if we want to reach the relative apparatus speed of 0.1c, the 
AB-Ramjet can spend 20 times less energy than the photon engine. Moreover, the AB-Ramjet 
engine can return spent energy (if it can transfer back self kinetic energy into mass with high 
efficiency). That means a space ship (using AB-Ramjet engine) can travel into space infinity time 
with stopping at planets (spending the mass for acceleration and return its mass in braking). But the 
photon engine losses part of self mass in the photon beam and can travel only limited time.

   4. Ball (Central charged core) discharge. The space apparatus or solar wind has high speed. This 
means the particles have a trajectory closed to a hyperbolic curve in the AB-area of charge influence 
and most of them will fly off into infinity. Only a proportion of them will travel through the ball. 
These particles decrease in speed and can discharge the ball. However, their speed and kinetic 
energy are very large because they are accelerated by the high voltage of the ball’s electric field 

10

(some tens or hundreds of MV). The necessary ball film (net) is very thin (measuring only a few 
microns). The particles pierce through the ball. If their loss of speed is less than their (apparatus) 
speed or the solar wind speed, their trajectory will be close to a hyperbolic curve and they will fly 
into space. If their loss of speed is more than the solar wind speed, their trajectory will be close to an 
ellipse, so they will return to the ball and, after many revolutions, they can discharge the ball if their 
perigee is less then the ball’s radius. This discharge may be compensated using special methods.  
  There are several possible methods for decreasing this discharge (Fig. 2c-g): a) A ball made of net;   
b), the central charge (core) has a cylindrical form (fig. 2f) without cover butt-end; c) the plates 
increase the particles speed to hyperbolic speed and reflect the returning particles. Note, the electric 
field does not depend on the form of the central charge at far distances, but does depend on the value 
of the charge.
  Let us estimate the discharging of the plates and the central charge (ball, core).
1) If the plate or ball has a net design, the particles will cross only the wires of plate. Note, the 

maximum coefficient of light transparency c1 is the ratio of the area of the wires, Sw, to the area of 
plate, Sp,

2) The particles crossing the wire lose a part of their energy. This loss may be calculated as a brake

  The particle (proton) track in the matter can be computed in following way:

  where l is track distance of the particles [cm]; Rt = Rt (U) is magnitude (from a table) [g/cm2]; γ is

particles. For protons the values of Rt  are presented in Table 1.

 For a = 6 m, E = 108 V/m,  the required ball cover thickness is δmax = 1.53 micron. For a = 4, 10 m 
δmax = 1.22 and 1.73 microns, respectively.
  This magnitude is less than the ball thickness required for the charge stress (see [54]) for current 
cover matter. That way the net and cylindrical core is better then the thin-filmed spherical ball. 
    For electrons, the thickness of half absorption may be calculated using equation [54]

infinity, which may be computed using the equation

computation is presented in fig. 7. As can be seen this energy not huge since it is only about 1 - 20 
kWh for a ball radius of a = 5 m and the electrical intensity is 25 - 100 MV/m. This energy may be 
restored through ball discharge by emitting the charge into space using a sharp edge.

Projects

Below the reader will find some examples which highlight the many benefits of the proposed AB-

Ramjet engines. Our parameters are not optimal. Our purpose is simply the demonstration of the 
potential of AB-Ramjet propulsion.

Example 1. AB-Ramjets for Earth orbits

1. Brief description of Earth's upper atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere consists of 79% nitrogen, 
20% oxygen, and 1% other gases. The atmosphere of the Earth may be divided into several distinct 
layers. The first two are the troposphere (0  - 18 km) and the stratosphere (18 - 90 km). Above the 
stratosphere is the mesosphere and above that is the ionosphere (or thermosphere), where many 
atoms are ionized (gain or lose electrons so they have a net electrical charge). The Sun's ultra-violet 
radiation and solar wind ionize molecules of the top atmosphere. The ionosphere is very thin, but it 
is where the aurora takes place, and it is also responsible for absorbing the most energetic photons 
from the Sun and solar wind. The concentration of ions (= electrons) at day and night time is shown 
in fig. 8. 

                               

ionosphere.

Fig. 8. Concentration/cm3 of ions (= electrons) in the day timeand night time in the D, E, F1, and F2 layers of 

   The ionosphere is divided into the layers D, E, F1, F2. Layer D contains ions of N2 and O2; the 
layers E, F1, F2  contain ions of O2 and O. 

2. Estimations of AB-Ramjet engine data for low-Earth satellite orbits. Computations are made for 
an apparatus (AB-Ramjet engine) having speed V0  = 8 km/s, a concentration of O2  ions = 105
ions/cm3, and the electric intensity E = 108 V/m.
  The computation of the AB-radius is presented in fig. 9. An electrostatic collector gathers ions 
from a surrounding area of more than10 km2.

electric intensity E=100 millions V/m, AB-Ramjet engine speed V0 = 8 km/s, O2 ion molar mass n = 32, 
ion density N = 105 ions/cm3. Equations are [4 - 6].

  Produced thrust and requested power are presented in figs. 10, 11. As can be seen, the thrust is 
significant enough to change the satellite's trajectory and increase the apparatus' speed to a velocity 
close to that required for an interplanetary trip. The required energy may be obtained from a solar 
battery.

energy. This energy may be used by apparatus devices or transferred to other space apparatus.

  The offered AB-engine may be used as an accelerator or brake for interplanetary space apparatus. 
The method of acceleration is shown in fig. 14. In the acceleration regime in region 7,  the thruster 
of the AB-engine accelerates a probe and increases the apogee of the elliptic trajectory. In the final 
trajectory, the probe is separated from the engine, gets a small impulse, and flies away into space. 
When the probe returns from space flight, the sequence is reversed and the AB-engine works as 
brake.

acceleration and brake, 8 - solar light. 

  The particle mass flow and the electric current flow (computed by equation [8],[9]) are shown in 
figs. 15, 16. The electric current is significantly large, creating a magnetic field which helps to 
straighten the particle's trajectory.

interplate voltage is shown in figure 17. Acceleration is produced in the thrust regime and 
deceleration is produced in the brake regime.

The size of the plates computed by equation [2b] is shown in fig. 18. As can be seen, the size is very 
small and the plates can be located inside of the cylindrical charged core (fig. 2f).

Example 2. Interplanetary AB-Ramjet.

  
  Brief information about the solar wind.  The Sun emits plasma which is a continuous outward 
flow (solar wind) of ionized solar gas throughout our solar system. The solar wind contains about 
90%  protons and electrons and some quantities of ionized -particles and gases. It attains speeds in 
the range of 300-750 km/s and has a flow density of 5107 - 5108 protons/ electrons/cm2s. The 
observed speed rises systematically from low values (300-400 km/s) to high values (650-700 km/s) 
in 1 or 2 days and then returns to low values during the next 3 to 5 days (Fig. 19).  Each of these 

18

high-speed streams tends to appear at approximately 27-day intervals or to recur with the rotation 
period of the Sun. On days of high Sun activity the solar wind speed reaches 1000 (and more) km/s 
and its flow density is109 - 1010 protons/electrons/ cm2s with 8 -70 particles per cm3. The Sun has 
high activity periods several days each year.
  The pressure of the solar wind is very small. For full braking it is in the interval  2.510 -10 ÷ 
6.310 -9 N/m2. This value is doubled when the particles have full reflection. The interstellar 
medium also has high-energy particles. Their density is about 1 particle/cm3.

Fig. 19. Speed and density variations in solar wind. The speed is in km/s, the density is in protons/cm3.

      

  Estimation of main parameters of the AB-engine. Let us estimate the main parameters of the 
AB-Ramjet engine for interplanetary apparatus. Interplanetary apparatus using a charged ball for 
solar wind drag was considered by the author in [54]. This work shows a great potential for these 
apparatus. The suggested AB-Ramjet engine (fig. 2) is different from the propulsion engine in [54].  
The AB-Ramjet has plates which can produce thrust, work as a generator of electrical energy, create 
stronger drag, and improve the control of the value and direction of both the drag and thrust. The 
central charge has a cylindrical form which dramatically decreases the discharging of the central 
charged core. The proposed AB-Ramjet can simultaneously produce useful drag (or thrust) and 
electric energy. It may seem astonishing, but an AB-Ramjet located in the strong solar wind would 
be capable of achieving a speed between 400  - 750 km/s. If we install the wind engine in a 
conventional space ship, the engine will produce sufficient energy and drag which would also useful 
if space ship moved in the wind direction. The drag produced by solar wind is a useful thrust for 
moving from Earth to outer Earth orbit: Saturn - Pluto. It may appear that this apparatus is lacking 
because it can only move away from the Sun. However, that is not the case. The AB-ramjet 
apparatus can decrease the orbit speed and the Sun's gravity will move it back to Earth orbit.
  Estimates of the main parameters of the AB-ramjet interplanetary engine and apparatus are
given below. The equations used in computing the estimates are in theoretical section [Eqs. 4 -6].  
Figure 20 shows the AB-radius of the efficiency area (catch area, clamp area) versus the charge 
radius of ball. Data used for computation: electric intensity E=100 millions V/m, solar wind speed 
V0 = 400 km/s, solar wind density N = 10 protons/cm3.

millions V/m, solar wind speed V0 = 400 km/s, solar wind density N = 10 protons/cm3. Equations are [4 -
6].

  Mass and charge flow (electric current) through the AB-engine were computed using equations [8]
and [9].  Results are presented in figs. 21 and 22 for the following conditions: electric intensity 
E=100 millions V/m, solar wind speed V0 = 400 km/s, solar wind density N = 10 protons/cm3. The 
flow mass is small (5 milligram/s), however the electric current is large.

   Figure 23 shows the maximal drag for full reflection versus the charge radius computed via 
equation 9a for the conditions: electric intensity E=100 millions V/m, solar wind speed V0 = 400 
km/s, solar wind density N = 10 protons/cm3.  As can be seen, the useful drag is sufficiently large 
and can produce significant acceleration for space apparatus. More detailed computations for the 
conventional charge are presented in [54].

V0 = 400 km/s, solar wind density N = 10 protons/cm3. Full reflection. 

  Thrust versus voltage between plates is shown in fig. 24 and the required energy for it is presented 
in fig. 25. For a thrust of 0.2 N, the required power is 4.5 kW. We can increase the voltage and 
obtain more thrust but the needed energy may not be acceptable for the apparatus.
  If we change polarity of the plates, we get the same energy (fig. 26) from apparatus braking, plus 
additional drag.

Fig.25. Requested AB-Ramjet engine power for thrust versus radius of charge and plate voltage for V0 = 400 

km/s and flow density 10 protons/cm3.

   The maximum energy and half of full reflection drag will be obtained when the positive value of 
(V0 - V) > 0  is close to zero. Here V0 is solar wind speed and V is apparatus speed (positive direction 
from Sun). Using equation [7] (mV2/2 = eU), for a wind speed V0 = 400 km/s, the calculation gives U
= 835 V. This means for a highly charged ball, U = 0 produces good reflection of the protons, near 
maximum drag, and zero positive electric energy.  A U slightly less than 835 V produces near 
maximum energy and a drag close to half of the maximum drag (fig.23). The computation for this 
case is presented in fig. 26. The power is significantly large and the engine may be used for both the 
apparatus and the charging of the electrostatic collector (core). 

22

Fig. 26. The maximum electric energy which can be obtained from the AB-Ramjet engine versus charge 

radius. In this case the drag (half of full drag) accelerates the apparatus to far planets.

  Let us find the size of the electrostatic collector. The maximal size of the plate radius is between 
the parameter Rh and the minimal radius of the hyperbolic trajectory. These magnitudes are 
presented for the outermost particles in fig. 27. The computation shows a particle flow that has 
maximum density in the plate center and small density in the plate ends. 

Fig.27. The minimal radius and parameter Rh of hyperbolic trajectory of outermost particles.

  We can determine a plate radius by the lower curve. For a charge (ball) radius of 10 meter, a plate 
radius of 20 meters is sufficient.  
   Let us estimate the discharging power for a radius of central charge of 10 meters. Let the wire 
diameter of the engine plate net be 0.1 mm with a cell size of 1010 cm. The light transparency 
coefficient is c1 = 4(0.001)2 = 410-6 (Eq. [19]. The brake coefficient of wire is c2 = 10-5 (Eq. [21]). 
The total transparency coefficient is c3 = c1c2 = 410 -11 (Eq. [22]).  Loss of energy in the plate is L
= c3IU = 410 -11450109 = 1.8 W. If we take into consideration the cylindrical central charge and 

23

other support elements and increase this value by 10, 100, 1000 times, the brake power  (750 kW, 
fig. 26) will be enough for the compensation this energy.
 The maximum electric force between plates for a distance of 2 meters and a voltage of 1000 V is 
0.14 N (eq. [18]). This means the support elements can be very light. The mass of the two quadratic 
plates of size 2020 m having aluminum wires is 1.7 kg.

Conclusion

  The primary research and computations of the suggested AB-engine show the numerous 
possibilities and perspectives of the space AB-ramjet engines. The density of the charged space 
particles is very small. But the proposed electrostatic collector can effectively gather the particles 
from a huge surrounding area and accelerate or brake them, generating thrust or braking on the order 
of several Newtons. The high speed solar wind allows simultaneously obtainment of useful drag 
(thrust) and great electrical energy. The simplest electrostatic gatherer accelerates a 100 kg probe up 
to a velocity of 100 km/s [54].  The probe offers flights into Mars orbit of about 70 days, to Jupiter 
orbit in about 150 days, to Saturn orbit in about 250 days, to Uranus orbit in about 450 days, to 
Neptune orbit in about 650 days, and to Pluto orbit in about 850 days. 
  The suggested electric gun is simple and can transfer energy (charge by electron beam) over a long 
distance to other space apparatus.
    The author has developed the initial theory and the initial computations to show the possibility of 
the offered concepts.  He calls on scientists, engineers, space organizations, and companies to 
research and develop the proposed perspective concepts.

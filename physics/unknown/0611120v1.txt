FATIGUE INDEPENDENT AMPLITUDE-FREQUENCY 
CORRELATIONS IN EMG SIGNALS 
  

to  assess  fatigue 

Summary.  In  order 

independent  amplitude-frequency 
correlations in EMG signals we asked nineteen male subjects to perform a series 
of  isometric  muscular  contractions  by  extensors  of  the  knee  joint.  Different 
amplitudes of the signal were due to randomly varying both the joint moment and 
the  overall  amplification  factor  of  the  EMG  apparatus.  Mean  and  median 
frequency, RMS and mean absolute value were calculated for every combination 
of  joint  moment  and  amplification at  the  original  sampling  rate  of  5  kHz  and  at 
several  simulated  lower  sampling  rates.  Negative  Spearman  and  Kendall 
amplitude-frequency  correlation  coefficients  were  found,  and  they  were  more 
pronounced at high sampling rates. 

 
  

 
 

1. INTRODUCTION 

 
Surface  electromyography  (SEMG)  signals  are  usually  processed  by  using  some  data 
reduction techniques to obtain quantities describing their amplitude and dominating frequency 
[1]. The four most often used are RMS and MAV (mean absolute value) for amplitude, and 
median frequency (Fmed) and mean frequency (Fmean) for frequency. All four are influenced by 
both  the  level  of  produced  muscular  force  and  fatigue.  It  is  also  commonly  accepted  in  the 
literature that fatigue can be deduced from SEMG signal behavior only when simultaneously 
a drop of Fmed or Fmean and an increase of signal amplitude is observed [2, 3]. In fact, when 
force produced by a muscle (or moment of force produced at a joint) is kept unchanged with 
time,  fatigue  results  in  a  downward  shift  of  the  frequency  spectrum  of  the  signal  and  an 
increase  of  signal  amplitude  [2,  3].  That  is  why  the  extent  or  onset  of  fatigue  is  typically 
assessed  by  simultaneous  monitoring  of  frequency  content  and  amplitude  of  surface  EMG 
signals collected from engaged muscles and not just the frequency parameters alone [1]. 

However, such negative amplitude-frequency correlations may occur also at no fatigue due 
to  the  varying  signal  to  noise  ratio,  which  could  blur  the  interpretation  of  EMG  signal 
frequency shifts in terms of fatigue. The objective of this work is therefore to perform a series 
of  EMG  measurements  under  conditions  leading  to  a  wide  range  of  signal  amplitudes  but 
minimizing the effects of fatigue, and to assess the resulting relationships between amplitude 
and frequency measures of the EMG signal. 

2. MATERIAL AND METHOD 

 
Nineteen healthy male volunteers, students of the University School of Physical Education 
in  Wrocław,  took  part  in  the  experiment.  Mean  values  and  standard  deviations  of  their  age, 
body height and body mass are gathered in Table 1.

EMG signals were collected by a pair of surface electrodes placed over the vastus medialis 
head of the quadriceps muscle, between its motor point and tendon, collinearly with muscle 
fibers.  The  signals  were  processed  by  the  Octopus  SEMG  device:  two  stage  amplification 
including  a  preamplifier  (ten 
few 
times)  placed 
centimeters  from  the  electrode 
site and the main amplifier (with 
amplification) 
adjustable 
overall 
an 
resulting 
amplification  factor  that  could 
be varied between 100 and 2000 
times. The amplified signals were sampled at a rate of 5000 Hz and recorded in digital form 
on the hard disk of a PC computer.

The subjects were asked to assume an upright sitting position on a measuring stand which 
included a stiff chair with adjustable back support. The position of their right lower limb was 
adjusted so as to place the knee joint transverse axis as collinearly as possible with the axis of 
the torque measuring device, and this was done for the knee angle of 90º. The subjects were 
then asked to try to extend their right limb at the knee joint by pushing against a fixed lever of 
the  torque  measuring  device  placed  just  above  the  ankle  joint,  which  resulted  in  isometric 
activity of the extensors of the knee joint. After a short warm-up, each subject was first asked 
to  produce  his  maximum  isometric  knee  extension  moment,  corresponding  to  maximum 
voluntary  contraction  (MVC)  of  the  quadriceps  muscle.  The  maximum  moment  of  force, 
produced at MVC, was recorded and later used as reference for all the remaining trials. Then, 
the  main  session  started  which  consisted  of  two-second-long  trials  realized  with  visual 
feedback at 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 50%, of MVC, and at the overall amplification factor of 
the  apparatus  equal  to  100,  200,  500,  1000,  2000.  The  sequence  of  torque  levels  and 
amplification  factors  was  random  to  minimize  the  effects  of  fatigue.  Also,  if  a  subject 
reported fatigue at some point of the session a rest break of a few minutes was provided. At 
the  end  of  the  session  the  knee  joint  moment  at  quadriceps  MVC  was  measured  again  as 
another test of possible presence of fatigue. 

For  each  subject,  the  experimental  session  was  repeated  on  the  next  day.  To  enhance 
repeatability of the results, the EMG electrodes were then placed at the sites marked during 
the first session. 

Two measures of the amplitude of the EMG signal, RMS and mean absolute value (MAV), 
and  two  measures  of  the  dominating  signal  frequency,  the  mean  frequency  (Fmean)  and  the 
median  frequency  (Fmed),  were  calculated  for  each  two-second-long  trial.  These  four 
quantities were evaluated both for the original signals sampled at the rate of 5 kHz and for a 
number  of  lower  sampling  rates  simulated  by  decimating  the  original  data  points  by integer 
factors. Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients were calculated between the measures 
of amplitude and frequency for some of those sampling rates. 

  

 
3. RESULTS 
 

The  measurement  results  for  one  subject  and  one  session  consist  of  four  numbers 
representing RMS, MAV, Fmean, Fmed calculated for each (out of five) muscle force level, each 
(out  of  five)  overall  amplification  factor  and  each  (out  of  one  hundred:  5000Hz,  2500Hz, 
1250Hz,  …,  50Hz)  sampling  rate.  Out  of  these  four  quantities  the  two  amplitude  measures 
behaved  quite  differently  from  the  frequency  measures  as  the  sampling  rate  increased.  The 
EMG  signal  amplitude  did  not  change  with  sampling  rate,  except  for  sampling  rates  below

such a behavior for RMS; the other amplitude measure – MAV – behaved similarly).

Contrasting with the above amplitude – sampling rate relationship was its counterpart for 
the two estimates of the dominating signal frequency. There was no chaotic behavior, even at 
very low sampling rates, in the dependence of the signal median frequency on sampling rate 
(Fig. 2), and all the five curves corresponding to knee joint extending moments equal to 5%-
50%  of  MVC  showed  a  consistent  growth,  which  was  more  pronounced  at  lower  muscle

As  for  the  mean  frequency  of  the  EMG  signal,  its  dependence  on  sampling  rate  was 
qualitatively  similar  to  that  shown  by  the  median  frequency  but  the  growth  rates  were 
generally higher and not vanishing even at the highest muscle forces investigated, i.e. 50 % 
MVC (Fig. 3).

behavior 
independent  of  the

muscle 
a 
produced 
of 
sampling 
about  500  Hz  was 
reached.  Indeed,  in 
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 the 
bunches  of  curves  corresponding  to  different  force  levels  start  as  essentially  one  curve  and 
then split at this frequency, giving 
rise 
to  a  possible  relationship 
between  amplitude  and  frequency 
measures,  the  more  pronounced 
the  more  split  the  curves  are. 
Above  500  Hz,  where  the  five 
curves  become  more  and  more 
signal 
increase 
split, 
amplitude  (i.e.  moving  vertically 
across a bunch of curves from the 
to  the  50%  curve) 
5%  curve 
should  result  in  a  decrease  of  the 
median  or  mean  frequency.  That 
is  why 
correlation 
negative 
between  amplitude  measures  and 
frequency  measures  of  EMG 
signal  should  be  expected  for 
sampling  rates  higher  than  500 
Hz.  Another  illustration  of  this 
effect is proposed in Fig. 4. where 
the  dependence  of 
the  mean 
frequency on force level and amplification factor is depicted as a surface graph. The height of 
the surface graph shows the value of the mean frequency for a given force level and a given 
amplification factor. At this high sampling rate, 5 kHz, the mean frequency of the EMG signal 
increases  rapidly  as  the  force  level  or  the  amplification  factor  (or  both)  decreases,  which, 
again, can be thought of as a negative amplitude-frequency correlation. 
In  order  to  assess  this  correlation  the  results  were  grouped  into  subsets  containing  data 
corresponding to a given amplification factor. Within each of those subsets were the results of 
calculation  of  the  two amplitude measures and  the  two  frequency  measures  found  in all  the 
subjects  at  five  different  force  levels  and  at  one  hundred  different  sampling  rates.  All  the 
subsets contained the same amount of data and they differed only by the overall amplification 
factor  of  the  EMG  apparatus.  Correlation  analysis  performed  within  those  subsets  of  data 
showed  that  the  amplitude and  frequency  measures  of  the  EMG  signals were  not  correlated

for low sampling rates but as the sampling rate increased passed the critical value of 500 Hz 
they became more and more interdependent.

    Two  examples  illustrating  this  tendency  of  amplitude-frequency  correlation  to  become 
more and more evident as sampling rate increased are shown in Fig. 5. and Fig. 6. In the first 
of these two figures the interdependence is shown between the mean frequency of the EMG 
signal and its RMS value, at the overall amplification factor 500 and sampling rate 2500 Hz. 
Most data points lie on or near a hyperbola and Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients 
between  mean  frequency  and  RMS  are  -0.93348  and  -0.80347,  respectively.  For  data 

A. Siemieński, A. Kebel, P. Klajner 
corresponding to sampling rate 5 kHz, they become -0.97702 and -0.89532, respectively, and 
the data points follow a hyperbola even more closely (Fig. 6). 
 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Our experimental protocol was designed to produce a wide variety of stationary EMG signals 
differing as much as possible by their amplitude, and to keep fatigue influence to a minimum. 
We looked at the behavior of measures of amplitude and measures of dominating frequency 
of the signals at sampling rates ranging from 50 Hz to 5 kHz. Our main conclusions are: 
•  amplitude measures such as RMS and MAV do not depend on sampling rate 
•  dominating frequency measures increase as sampling rate increases 
•  dominating  frequency  measures  do  not  depend  on  signal  amplitude  for  sampling  rates 
lower  than  500  Hz;  for  higher  sampling  rates,  the  smaller  signal  amplitude  the  more 
steeply the frequency measure increases with sampling rate 

•  this  gives  rise  to  negative  amplitude-frequency  correlations  that  occur  at  sampling  rates 

higher than 500 Hz and become more pronounced as sampling rate increases 

•  such correlations, found here in an experiment designed to minimize fatigue, could shadow 
the response of amplitude and frequency measures to fatigue and should therefore be taken 
into account when monitoring the onset and development of fatigue 

•  to minimize these effects oversampling of EMG signals should be avoided

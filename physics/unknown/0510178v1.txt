Abstract. Considering that the rays in the Michelson-Morley interferometer perform the 
radar detection of its mirrors, we use a relativistic diagram that displays, at a convenient 
scale, their location and the path of the rays. This approach convinces us that the rays 
that come from the two arms interfere with zero phase difference without using the usual 
ingredient, length contraction. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Telemetry1,2,3  is  associated  with  the  detection  of  the  space-time 
 
coordinates  of  distant  events  by  receiving  light  signals  that  have  left  the 
point  where  the  event  took  place  (photographic  detection)  or  by  sending 
light signals towards the point where the event takes place and receiving it 
back  after  reflection  (radar  detection).  In  the  case  of  the  photographic 
detection  of  a  luminous  profile  we  work  with  a  convergent  bundle  of  light 
rays  whereas  in  the  case  of  the  radar  detection  we  work  with  a  divergent 
bundle of light rays. The bundle ends at the observation point in the case of 
the  photographic  detection  but  starts  from  it  in  the  case  of  the  radar 
detection. 
 
The  plane  electromagnetic  wave  is  a  mathematical  construction  in 
which the rays are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the wave front. 
A  point  like  source  of  light  emits  a  spherical  electromagnetic  wave.  At  a 
very large distance from the source we can consider that the wave it emits is 
a plane wave. Relativistic telemetry could be operative in the plane wave as 
well. 
 
 An  approach  to  relativistic  telemetry,  which  is  free  of  paradoxes, 
works  with  the  events  generated  by  the  involved  light  signals  as  detected 
from two inertial reference frames in relative motion. One of them is the rest 
frame  of  the  profile  we  detect  and  respectively  of  the  source  of  light 
involved  in  the  telemetry.  Performing  the  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations 
on the space-time coordinates of the corresponding events, we can derive the 
equation that describes the detected profile in the reference frame relative to 
which it moves as a function of the relative velocity between the two frames 
and  proper  physical  quantities  (distance  and  angles)  measured  in  the  rest 
frame  of  the  source.  The  reference  frames  involved  are  K(XOY)  and 
K’(X’O’Y’).  The  corresponding  axes  of  the  two  reference  frames  are 
parallel  to  each  other,  the  OX(O’X’)  axes  are  common  and  K’(X’O’Y’)

If the electromagnetic wave propagates in the negative direction of the O’Y’ 
axis  we  obtain  the  corresponding  results  by  changing  the  sign  of  c  in  the 
equations derived above. All the equations are sensitive against this change 
in the scenario.

3. Illustrating the Michelson-Morley experiment.  
The  Michelson-Morley  experiment4  is  a  strong  convincing  argument 
 
in  the  favour  of  Einstein’s  second  postulate  that  is  otherwise  somehow 
counterintuitive  for  those  who  just  start  learning  special  relativity.  Its 
importance in teaching special relativity as an introductory subject is largely 
debated in the literature5. 
We  agree  with  Schumacher6  by  considering  that  the  Michelson-
 
Morley experiment should be taught to students who have the skill to handle 
the  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations.  Our  purpose  is  to  illustrate  how  the 
Michelson-Morley  interferometer  works  when  we  observe  it  from  the 
reference frame K and we know how it works in its rest frame K’. We intend 
to  illustrate  this  experiment  using  the  relativistic  diagrams  we  have 
presented 
the  Lorentz-Einstein 
transformations  into  a  movie  and  display  in  true  magnitudes  the  Cartesian 
and  polar  coordinates  of  the  events  involved  as  well  as  the  distances 
travelled  by  the  light  signals  inside  the  interferometer  arms.  They  should 
convince us that: 

far.  These  diagrams  convert 

so

•  The  semi-transparent  mirror  at  the  centre  of  the  interferometer 
correctly  reflects  the  light  to  and  from  the  interferometer  axes  and 
correctly  overlaps  the  longitudinal  ray  over  the  transverse  ray  at  the 
detector.  

•  The  distances  travelled  by  the  light  waves  interfering  at  the 
observation  point  are  equal  to  each  other,  the  waves  arriving  there 
without phase difference. 

 
 
Figures  7a  and  7b  shows  the  Michelson-Morley  interferometer  in 
action. Figure 7a depicts the situation when the half silvered mirror (HSM)’ 
reflects the incident plane wave propagating in the positive direction of the 
common axes (ray a’) towards the mirror 1 (M1)’ located at the end of the 
vertical  interferometer  arm  and  permits  it  to  propagate  farther  towards 
mirror (M2)’ located ate the end of the horizontal arm (ray d’). The origin of 
time  (t=t’=0)  coincides  with  the  ray  arriving  time  at  the  centre  of  the  half 
silvered mirror.

vertical arm (ray a’) and partially continues to propagate towards mirror 2’. 
 
 
Figure 7b depicts the situation when the ray b’ reflected by the mirror (M1)’ 
and the ray reflected by the mirror (M2)’ located at the end of the horizontal 
interferometer  arm  arrive  at  the  centre  of  the  half  silvered  mirror.  Without 
losing in generality we can make a time-shift considering that the arrival of 
the two rays at the centre of (HSM)’ takes place at t=t’=0.

mirror 1’ and ray e’ reflected by mirror 2’ arrive simultaneously at the half silvered 
mirror. The rays b’ and e’ are directed towards a microscope where they interfere with a 
zero shift in time. 
 
 
In  the  situation  depicted  in  Figure  7a  we  consider  parallel  rays  of  an 
electromagnetic wave propagating in the positive direction of the O’X’ axis 
and  detected  at  the  half  silvered  mirror  respectively  parallel  rays  of  an 
electromagnetic wave propagating in the positive direction of the O’Y’ axis 
detected at the half silvered mirror and at the mirror 1’ as well. In order to

propagate  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  O’Y’  axis  (10).  The  rules  of 
handling the diagram enable us to find out that if the segment 1’2’ represents

the case presented in Figure 8 the bisector of the angle made by the rays a

4. Conclusions 
 
 
Reducing  the  Michelson-Morley  to  radar  and  to  a  photographic 
detection  of  the  half  silvered  mirror  we  propose  a  relativistic  diagram  that 
envisages  the paths  of  the  light  rays  in  the  interferometer  as  detected  from 
the stationary reference frame. The diagrams display in true magnitudes the 
angles  and  the  apparent  shapes  of  the  mirrors.  Our  analysis  does  not  take 
into  account  the  length  contraction  of  the  horizontal  interferometer  arm  in 
contrast with Lorentz (1895) who considered that the negative result of the 
Michelson-Morley experiment could be explained by the contraction of the 
length  of  the  horizontal  arm.  A  qualitative  diagram  tracing  the  path  of  the 
rays is presented by Soni7.

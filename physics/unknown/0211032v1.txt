Abstract 

A novel conception of “sensitive mode” (SM) is proposed to apply in gravitational-
wave  advanced  interferometer  configuration  (AIC).  The  SM  is  resonant  oscillation  of 
electromagnetic  field in “white-light  cavity”  (WLC),  where  the  resonance  line is  broadened 
without  decreasing  cavity  quality.  The  resonant  field  frequency  of  the  SM  is  greatly 
susceptible  to  the  change  of  cavity  length,  and  the  SM  is  established  in  a  cavity  with  time 
constant  smaller  than  a  conventional  mode.  Due  to  these  advantages  the  sensitivity  and 
bandwidth of AIC can be increased 
Key words: gravitational waves, interferometer, sensitive mode, white-light cavity 
 
There  are  currently  several  projects  constructing  GW  detector  that  relay  on  ground-
based laser interferometers: TAMA, GEO, VIRGO, and LIGO [1]. In the VIRGO and 
the  LIGO  they  expect  to  measure  a  small  phase  shift  between  two  light  beams, 
traversing  two orthogonal arms  of interferometer. The  length  of the arm is arranged 
such  that  path  lengths  in  two  arms  differ  by  a  half  wavelength,  so  the  two  beams 
interfere  in  output  destructively,  producing  a  dark  fringe.  However,  a  passing  GW 
would stretch and squeeze the arms, causing a small phase shift, which is converted 
into  an  observable  light-power  change  at  interferometer  output.  Different  noise 
sources  deteriorate  output  signal-to-noise  ratio  [2].  To  increase  phase  shift  in  the 
LIGO two Fabry-Perot cavities are used in the arms, where light is reflected back and 
forth several times increasing effective path length. Similar effect will be achieved in 
signal recycling  configuration [3]  of  the GEO, where  an additional cavity is formed 
by  a  partly  transparent  mirror,  placed  in  interferometer  output.  Other  long  time 
development topics to increase the performance of the GW interferometer are using of 
cryogenic bar detectors, squeezed light, QND technique and white-light cavity (WLC) 
[4].  The  concept  of  the  WLC  has  been  proposed  to  increase  the  bandwidth  of 
interferometer [5]. For this purpose a transparent medium with anomalous dispersion 
was suggested to use in the cavity. At some value of dispersion slope the resonance 
line  considerably  broadens  (without  decreasing  of  cavity  quality),  providing  by  this 
the increasing of interferometer bandwidth. In a recent experiment [5] a medium with 
anomalous dispersion and low losses was prepared, proving that a transparent medium 
with anomalous dispersion can be realized. 
In this present paper we show that except of broadened line the oscillation in WLC is 
extremely sensitive to the change of cavity length, and define such oscillation as the 
SM. We derive analytical formulas describing the parameters of the SM and analyze 
the AIC based on the SM, as well as propose a new way to establish the SM by using 
a medium with normal dispersion. 
Consider a  Fabry-Perot  cavity with  an input mirror intensity  reflection  coefficient r2 
and  losses  p.  Instead  of  a  rear  mirror  a  small  cavity  with  input  mirror  intensity 
2 and losses p1 is used. The rear mirror of the small cavity is

where φ(ω)=argR1(ω). 
Here |ρ(ω)| is a narrow resonance function with central angular frequency ω0. As it is 
seen from (4) ω0 is a root of the equation ψ(ω, L) = 2πk (k is an integer). When the 
cavity length changes by ∆L the resonance angular frequency changes by ∆ω, and its 
new value ω0 + ∆ω must satisfy the equation 
∆+ω∆+ωψ

.                                             (6) 
To  approximately  solve  the  (6)  an  reveal  the  relationship  between ∆ω  and  ∆L,  it  is 
convenient to expand φ(ω0 + ∆ω) in series of Taylor around ω0. Since φ(ω) is an odd 
function of (ω − ω0), its second derivative in ω0 is zero, and (6) becomes

where φ′ is the first derivative of the phase (phase slope), φ′″ is the third derivative of 
the phase respect to ω calculated in ω0. 
In the case of a cavity with a conventional rear mirror having constant phase (φ′ = φ′″ 
= 0) the well known expression of frequency shift follows from (7) 

.                                                     (8) 
However in the case when a rear mirror (or a small cavity) has a frequency dependent 
phase with the negative slope complying with the condition 

L/L0∆ω−=ω∆

the solution of (7) essentially differs from (8), being with relative error ~(∆L/L)1/3

To estimate (10) note that negative phase slope is rather an unusual property, which 
takes place in a narrow frequency interval, where the phase changes on ~ π (see Fig. 
2). Since we require (9) it means that this angular frequency interval is dω ~ πc/2L. 
Therefore  φ′″  ~  π/dω3  ~  (L/c)3,  and  hence  from  (10)  we  obtain  the  approximate 
formula

where λ0 = 2πc/ω0 is the wavelength. 
Note that in [7], to estimate φ′′ (if φ is not an odd function) we used the crude formula 
φ′′ ~  L/cω obtaining an  overestimated value of  frequency  shift ∆f ~ f(∆L/L)1/2 ~ 10 
kHz  for  ∆L/L  =  10−21.  By  using  present  the  more  correct  approximation  of  the 
frequency  interval  where  the  negative  phase  slope  takes  place,  one  can  obtain  φ′′  ~ 
π/dω2  ~  (L/c)2,  and  better  estimation  of  the  frequency  shift  in  that  case:  ∆f    ~  
f(∆L/L)1/2(λ0/L)1/2  ~  0.1Hz. 
Formula (11) provides a good estimation for analyzing ∆f. It shows that the frequency 
shift  decreases,  when  cavity  length  increases.  Nevertheless,  due  to  the  cubic  root 
relationship,  the  value  of  (11)  even  for  L  =  4  km  still  considerably  surpasses 
conventional frequency shift (8). For example, if L = 4 km, λ0 = 1064 nm, and ∆L/L = 
10−21, formula (11) gives ∆ω/2π ~ 10 Hz, meanwhile a conventional frequency shift 
(8) is only about 10−7 Hz. 
Thus under condition (9) a special oscillation is established in cavity, being extremely 
susceptible  to  the  change  of  cavity  length.  When  this  condition  is  violated  and  the 
second  term  in  (7)  becomes  equal  to  the  third  one  in  the  order  of  smallness,  the 
frequency shift sharply decreases to the conventional value (8), which means that the 
SM  is  transformed  to  conventional  mode.  Note  that  condition  (9)  was  proposed  (in 
other definitions) for the first time in [5] to increase the bandwidth of cavity without 
decreasing its quality. Such novel cavity was defined as the WLC to emphasize that it 
resonates  in  wide  band  of  frequencies.  Here  we  showed  another  important 
consequence  of  (9)  missed  in  [5]:  under  condition  (9)  the  oscillation  becomes 
extremely susceptible to the change of cavity length. Because of that, we define such 
oscillations  as  the  SM  and  believe  that  the  SM  can  find  different  applications, 
particularly  in  interferometric  devices.  Thus,  the  SM  is  actually  the  resonant 
oscillations in the WLC. Nevertheless, introduction of a new term – the SM seems to 
be relevant, because the SM can be established not only in optical resonators, but for 
example in microwave [8] or acoustic resonators. On the other hand, the terminology 
WLC does not point out on the high susceptibility of oscillations in the WLC. 
Negative phase slope, being the key condition for establishing the SM (or for building 
the  WLC)  can  be  realized  by  using  a  transparent  medium  (gas)  having  anomalous 
dispersion [5, 8] (it should be noted that such gas has been investigated in the past [9] 
as  a  medium  supporting  superluminal  propagation  of  light  pulses).  Here  to  obtain 
negative slope we propose to use in the small cavity a gas, which is pumped to obtain 
the  population  inversion.  Refractive  index  and  amplification  coefficient  of  such  gas 
with  a  spectral  line  centered  on  the  ω0  can  be  written  as  a  conventional (absorbing) 
gas  using  a  simple  oscillator  model.  Assuming  that  all  the  atoms  are  pumped  to  a 
given energy level we will have

Here  A  =  Ne2/mω0,  N  is  density  of  the  gas,  e  and  m  are  the  charge  and  mass  of 
electron  and  γ  is  a  damping  constant  for  which  we  will  use  an  arbitrary  value  0.5 
MHz. 
Although  in  the  vicinity  of  ω0  such  gas  has  normal  dispersion  and  a  positive  phase 
slope,  nevertheless  by  appropriately  arranging  the  small  cavity  parameters  one  can 
achieve required negative phase slope satisfying (9). For this purpose, we will use r1 =

0.4, p1 = 0.8384243, Ab/λ0 = 36720.14 Hz. The last condition can be arranged both by 
tuning the length of the small cavity or the density of the gas. For example, if b = 10 
cm  and  λ0  =  1064  nm,  it  must  be  A  =  0.3907023  Hz.  Then,  calculating  in  (2)  the 
reflective  function  of  the  small  cavity  we  have  |R1(ω0)|  =  1.00000175,  and  φ′  =  − 
26.67·10−6  sec,  satisfying  eq.  (9)  for  L  =  4  km.  Thus,  the  SM  is  established  in  the 
large  cavity  or,  which  is  equivalent,  the  large  cavity  becomes  the  WLC,  providing 
greatly increased value of frequency shift (10). Calculating from (4), and substituting 
in (10) the value φ″′ =1.63·10−13 sec3 we obtain the exact formula for the shift ∆f of 
the SM resonance frequency 
]Hz[f

.                               (13) 
95.1
For  ∆L/L  =  10−21  this  formula  gives  ∆f  =  1.95  Hz,  unlike  to  above  mentioned 
approximated  value  10  Hz,  following  from  (11).  Note,  that  (10),  (11),  (13)  are  still 
valid  if  ∆ω  is  inside  the  frequency  interval  dω  ~  πc/2L,  where  the  phase  has  a 
negative  slope.  By  substituting  this  value  in  (11),  one  can  found  that  the  maximum 
shift of the cavity length ∆Lmax still allowing the existence of the SM is ∆Lmax ~ 0.1λ0. 
Further shift of the cavity length the cubic root dependence (11) transforms to linear 
one (8), which means that the SM is transformed to conventional mode, or the WLC 
becomes  a  conventional  cavity.  This  conclusion  follows  from  the  exact  numerical 
solution of eq. (6), which gives the SM resonance frequency shift versus the change of 
the cavity length (see Fig. 3). 
On the base of high susceptibility of SM frequency to the change of cavity length an 
AIC  scheme  can  be  proposed  where  the  shift  of  SM  frequency  is  converted  to 
appropriately increased phase shift. In this AIC the external laser is removed, and the 
lasing  of  the  SM  originates  in  the  large  cavity,  when  the  gas  in  the  small  cavity  is 
appropriately pumped. By using an additional transparent mirror (is shown in Fig. 1 
by the dotted line) a small portion of the light can be extracted from the large cavity in 
two  opposite  directions.  The  phase  difference  Φ  of  these  two  beams  is  Φ  =  2ω0d/c, 
where d is the distance between the additional mirror and the input mirror of the large 
cavity. When  cavity  length  will change on ∆L due to the GW, the frequency of the 
SM will also change according to (10), and Φ will change by ∆Φ = 2ω0∆d/c + 2∆ωd/c 
≈ 2∆ωd/c. For the parameters used in (13) and d ≈ 1 km we obtain ∆Φ ≈ 103(∆L/L)1/3, 
which gives a strongly increased value of the phase shift ∆Φ ≈ 10−4 rad for ∆L/L = 
10−21, and  ∆Φ ≈ 10−5 rad for ∆L/L = 10−24. Proposed AIC is suitable as well for the 
interferometers having one arm.  
Another feature of the SM and WLC is the broadened resonance line, which enhances 
interferometer bandwidth. Let us consider this feature in more details using the above 
obtained parameters of small cavity, which transforms the large cavity into the WLC. 
Numerical  calculations  of  (4)  give  the  resonance  function  |ρ(ω)|,  shown  in  Fig.  4 
(solid  lines).  The  dotted  lines  correspond  to  the  resonance  function  of  the 
conventional cavity, which is obtained from (4) by substituting |R1(ω)|=1, φ(ω) = π/2. 
It  is  seen  that  the  WLC  has  wider  resonance  line  and  consequently  shorter  storage 
time  than  a  conventional  cavity,  because  cavity  bandwidth  and  storage  time  are 
inversely  proportional  quantities  (it  follows  from  the  general  properties  of  Fourier 
transform  of  the  cavity  resonance  function  and  its  temporal  function,  describing  the 
processes of loading or decaying).  
It is useful to reveal the relation between the bandwidth and the finesse of the WLC. 
By  changing  r  in  (4),  one  can  numerically  derive  the  values  of  the  finesse  and

appropriate  bandwidths  for  both  conventional  cavity  and  the  WLC.  To  estimate 
analytically this relation, let us expand the exponent in (4) in Taylor series with three 
terms around ω0. Then the width 2δω of the resonance function at 0.71 amplitude is 
determined by the equation

where β0 =  |R1(ω0)|, β = |R1(ω0+δω)|,. 
For  a  conventional  cavity  (δψ  =  Lδω/c)  the  known  expressions  of  the  frequency 
bandwidth 2δf = 2δω/2π and the storage time τ follow from (14), by substituting β ≈ 
β0 = 1

Then  the  dependence  β  =  β0(1−  810δω2)  is  numerically  derived  from  (2),  and  after 
appropriate  transformations  of  (14)  the  following  simple  expression  for  the  WLC 
bandwidth is obtained

As  it  was  mentioned  above  the  WLC  storage  time  is  inversely  proportional  to  its 
bandwidth.  However,  the  appropriate  exact  formula  can  not  be  derived  within  the 
present  monochromatic  waves  consideration.  Therefore  we  have  the  following 
asymptotic formula for the WLC storage time

Corresponding to (15) - (17) curves are plotted in Fig. 5 by the solid and the dotted 
lines,  revealing  that  the  WLC  bandwidth  is  inversely  proportional,  and  the  storage 
time is directly proportional to the square root of cavity finesse. Because of that it is 
beneficially to employ the WLC with high finesse, to increase the GW induced output 
phase shift; by this the storage time increases not very much.  
In  conclusion,  we  revealed  that  the  frequency  of  resonant  oscillation  in  the  WLC  is 
extremely  susceptible  to  the  change  of  cavity  length,  and  introduced  for  such 
oscillation a new term – the SM. We

Fig. 4 Resonance functions of 4-km WLC (the solid lines) and conventional cavity (the dotted lines). 
For r = 0.97 (which corresponds to cavity finesse F = 103) the conventional cavity  has  line  width at 
0.71 amplitude 0.36 kHz, and the WLC has line width 1.24 kHz. For r = 0.999 (finesse is 3150) the line 
widths of the conventional cavity and the WLC are correspondingly 12 Hz, and 224 Hz.

Fig.  5  Storage  times  of  4-km  conventional  cavity  (the  dashed  line)  and  the  WLC  (the  solid  line), 
derived  from  numerical  analysis  of  the  resonance  function  (4).  The  dotted  line  corresponds  to 
approximate formula (17). Storage times of conventional cavity and the WLC are correspondingly 0.87 
ms, and ~ 0.3 ms for F = 103 (r = 0.97), and 26.67 ms and ~ 1.4 ms for F = 3150 (r = 0.999).

Abstract  
The  onset  of  thermoacoustic  instabilities  in  lean-premixed  gas-turbine  combustors  is  a  crucial  problem  leading  to 
degradation  in  engine  and  emissions  performance  and  shortened  component  life.  The  main  aim  of  this  study  is  to 
propose a methodology based both on concepts of nonlinear dynamics and on geometric-topological invariants, for 
the characterization of attractors related to measurements based on the flame spontaneous light emission, like OH* 
radical,  in  order  to  classify  different  phases  of  the  combustion  process  and  to  better  recognize  the  transition 
mechanisms  leading  to  the  thermoacoustic  instabilities.  Preliminary  results,  clearly  show  the  powerfulness  of  the  
approach  to show the dynamical evolution of the flame and to evidence the onset of the thermoacoustic instabilities: 
in particular the topological invariant index (genus and related quantities) appears as the best candidate for an early 
indicator  of  the  dynamical  transition,  characterized  by  the  onset  of  a  more  persistent,  low  entropy  torus  (quasi-
periodic motion), as the related “thermoacoustic attractor”.  

 
Introduction 

The 

instability 
investigation  of  combustion 
mechanisms in lean premixed gas turbine combustors 
is  of  great  interest  due  to  increasingly  stringent 
emissions  demands,  particularly  in  regards  to  NOx 
emissions. These systems produce significantly lower 
amounts  of  emissions  than  conventional  gas  turbine 
combustors  by  burning  the  fuel  at  low  temperatures. 
On  the  other  hand,  these  operating  conditions  are 
characterized  by 
the  occurrence  of  combustion 
instabilities,  which  are  mainly  manifested  as  large 
amplitude,  organized  oscillations  of  the  flow  field 
excited  and  coupled  by  unsteady  combustion 
processes.  Such  combustion  instabilities  can  cause  a 
significant 
combustion 
performances and a reduction of components life.

The  wavelet  cross-correlation  analysis  allows  to 
extend the standard Fourier cross-correlation analysis 
to  non-stationary  signals  whose  power  spectral 
characteristics are not constant in time.  

This  approach  gives  interesting  results  for  the 
recognition  of the states of dynamical systems but it 
cannot  be  used  for  an  early  diagnostic  because  state 
variations  appear  suddenly  in  the  graphic.  Moreover 
the 
time  required  makes  it 
inadequate to be used in real time. This brought us to 
study and to use methods based on nonlinear dynamic 
tools. 

long  computational 

The  first  step  is  to  consider  the  reconstruction of 
the  attractor  associated  to  the  dynamical  process  in 
the Embedding Space, using the Embedding Theorem 
[6].  Then  we  make  a  geometrical-topological 
characterization of attractors associated to the phases 
of  dynamical  evolution  using  some  dynamical 
indicators: 
•  Attractor entropy – a dispersion measure; 
•  Trajectory curvature – a geometrical index; 
•  Genus – a topological invariant index. 

Given an attractor in Rn associated to a dynamical 
system    we  define  the  attractor  entropy  as  the 
Shannon Entropy:[7]

Entropy  measures  the  dispersion  of  an  attractor 
and the regularity of a process: a very regular process 
has  a  small  attractor  and  low  entropy,  while  an 
irregular one has a large attractor and high entropy.

So  c  is  the  angular  deviation  velocity  of  the  unity

We  calculate  the  curvature  of  an  attractor  using  the 
discrete  versions  of  (1)  and  (2)  which  has  proven  to 
be a good dynamic index [7].  

The  genus  is  a  topological  invariant  which  for  a 
surface in a three dimensional space is defined as the 
number  of  holes  minus  the  number  of  connected 
components of the surface. 

Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem we can calculate 

the genus using the gaussian curvature K:

The  use  of  a  topological  property  to  characterize 
the  states  of  a  dynamical  process  is  justified  by  the 
observation  of  equivalence  between  dynamical  and 
topological equivalence [9][10]. 

To  calculate  the  genus  of  an  attractor  we  use  a 
discrete  formula,  valid  for  all  the  regular  polygonal 
surfaces in a three dimensional space:

where Vi  are the angles incident on the i-th vertex. 

In  fact,  we  implemented  an  algorithm  which 
approximates  the  attractor  surface  with  a  polygonal 
one made by cubes and calculates the genus using the 
relation (3).  

Our algorithm is based on that used by Gott et al. 
to determine the topological structure of the universe 
in [11] and described in [12]. 

 We  modified  the  original  algorithm  so  that  the 
fundamental parameters of the process, which are  the 
length  of  the  edge  of  every  cube  l   and  the  critical 
the 
density 

r c,  are  chosen  univocally  using

It  has  been  experimentally  verified  that  the 
thermoacoustic  instability  state  is  characterized  by 
having  toroidal  attractors  and  hence  genus  0.  This 
isn’t an unexpected result because this instability state 
can be seen as a quasi-periodic motion. 

So from the genus of the attractors of a dynamical 
process  we  extract  two  further  indices,  useful  to 
characterize the states of a process and to determine if 
they are stable or unstable. 

The  persistency  index  counts  the  percentage  of 
attractors with genus 0 during the system evolution so 
tells us how near we are to the instability.

In  order  to  follow  the  temporal  evolution  of  the 
above indices we used a moving time-window version 
of  their  mathematical  formulation.    In  this  way  we 
were  able  to  accurately  detect  the  transition between 
different dynamical states.

As  indicated  by  process  parameters  displayed  in 
Tab.  1,  this  time  series  is  not stationary, with a time 
changing  for  both  frequency  and  amplitude  content. 
Through  the  wavelet  analysis  we  are  able  to  follow 
the  evolution  of  the power spectrum: we start with a 
dominant  characteristic  frequency  at  105  Hz  and  a 
coupled secondary frequency at 125 Hz. The wavelet 
analysis  allows 
the  amplitude 
to  point  out 
intermittency  of  the  above  frequencies,  probably 
related  to  vortex  shedding  phenomena.  At  about  22 
seconds  there  is  a  clear  spontaneous  transition  to  a 
thermoacoustic instability, evidenced by a strong rise 
of  the  emission  amplitude  with  the  onset  of  the  next 
few  harmonics,  characteristic  of  the  acoustic field of 
the  combustion  system  considered.    This  fact  is 
confirmed  by  the  wavelet  map  of  the  pressure 
fluctuation signal shown in Fig. 3.  Indeed, the signal 
amplitude and the wavelet power reach values typical 
for thermoacoustic oscillations.

to the thermoacoustic instability, specially the entropy 
and the topological ones.  

 

In  fact,  the  entropy  value  makes  oscillation  near 
the value 7 during the phase of stability and near the 
value 5.5 during the instability one, with a finite time 
gradual  transition  between  them.  This  is  a  first 
indication  supporting  the  deterministic  nature  of  the 
processes  driving  the  transition  to  thermoacoustic 
oscillation state. 

The  curvature  initially  oscillates  near  the  value 
1.5, has some bigger oscillations during the transition 
phase  and  assumes  in  a  almost  stable  manner  the 
value 1.7 during the oscillating phase.  

The genus initially oscillates near the 0 value and 
in the second phase is always equal to 0, even if the 
transition for this index seems to be more sudden and 
unpredictable.

instead  oscillates  and 
sometimes  reaches  its  maximal  value  during  the 
stable  phase  and  is  always  equal  to  10  during  the 
unstable one, so with its behavior advises us about the 
possibility  of  thermoacoustic  instability  throughout 
the test. The behavior of this two indices confirms the 
fact  that  during  the  thermoacoustic  instability  the 
related  attractor  has  always  toroidal  shape.  This  fact 
is 
quasi-periodic  motion

characterizing the thermoacoustic oscillation (Fig. 5). 
 The torus quality index oscillates around the 0.15 
value  during  the  first  phase  and  around  0.18  during 
the  second,  with  a  finite  time  gradual  transition 
between them. From this we can deduce that although

The results of our non linear analysis are summarized 
by  Figs.  4  and  5  for  OH*  emission  and  pressure 
respectively. 

Before  to  analyze  the  signal  we  verified  that  the 
embedding  dimension  is  equal  to  three,  so  that  we 
could use the topological methods described before.  

Observing  Fig.  4  we  can  see  that  all  the  indices 
represented  allow  us  to  distinguish  the  different 
dynamical states and in particular the transition phase

optical  one  by  2.4  ms,  which  corresponds  to  an 
angular phase of 144°. This delay information can be 
very  useful  to  set  up  accurate  prediction  models  for 
combustion instabilities.

the  attractors  have  often  toroidal-like  shape  also 
during  the  non-oscillatory  phase,  we  can  distinguish 
between  them  considering  their  regularity:  the  torus 
of  the  oscillatory  phase  is  more  definite  and  less 
diffusive  than that of the non-oscillatory state. 
The  nonlinear  attractor  characterization  of  an 
unsteady  premixed  flame  tip  motion  of  a  rotating 
Bunsen  flame,  showed  the  possibility  of  a  transition 
from a cycle limit, a torus like quasi-periodic motion 
and  a  non-periodic  (chaotic)  motion,  depending  on 
the flow velocity [13].  

Similar results are obtained for pressure signal in 
Fig. 6, with the difference that in this case the genus 
and the quality index are less useful to recognize the 
transition. In fact we found transitions similar to those 
observed  for  OH*  signal  for 
the 
curvature and the TQI, while the genus in this case is 
almost always equal to 0, so the persistency index is 
almost always equal to 10 and the difference between 
the  two  phases  is  more  difficult  to  distinguish  using 
them.

The optical signal appears a good choice to obtain 
accurate  information  about  non  stationary    unstable 
combustion  processes.  However,  the  combination  of 
optical  and  pressure  signals  is  very  interesting  to 
know 
the 
amplitude-phase  correlations.  In  Fig.  7  we  show  the 
wavelet cross-correlation analysis for the case A. The 
edge  of  the  maximum  correlation,  indicated  by  the 
white line in the map, becomes very stable during the 
thermoacoustic phase. The related phase lag between 
the  dominant  mode  of    OH*  and  pressure  signals 
changes  toward  higher  absolute  values  during  the 
transition and the average value in the thermoacoustic

It  is  significant  to  observe that all the considered 
nonlinear indices allow us to recognize the transition 
between  the  two  regimes,  although  some  are  more 
interesting  if  calculated  using  the  OH*  rather  than 
pressure  signal,  and  that  all  the  transitions  are 
synchronous.  Moreover,  we  can  observe  that  the 
transition happens in a finite time interval, about 2-3 
seconds,  thus  the  process  that  brings  to  instability 
seems  to  be  predictable  in  advance,  following  a 
gradual deterministic behavior.

important  feature 

The reason for preferring these nonlinear methods 
to more classical ones, including the wavelet analysis, 
is mainly in the fact that the non linear analysis allows 
to  detect  the  transition  in  a  more  accurate  level, 
requiring  also  a  smaller  computational  time,  so  that 
they  appear  more  useful  for  real  time  applications.

design,  an  early  diagnostic  of  the  process.  It  is 
important  to  note  that  the  entropy  and  curvature 
parameters  can  be  applied  also  when  the  embedding 
space  dimension  is  greater  than  three,  probably  a 
common situation in full scale combustion systems.

  We selected a second combustion case, case B in 
Tab.  1,  to  check  the  performances  of  the  nonlinear 
methods in a different flow configuration. In this case 
we  eliminated  the  contribution  of  the  main  diffusion 
fuel flow rate.  

The 

time  behavior  of  the  nonlinear  indices 
presents  here  bigger  fluctuations,  because  of  the 
different conditions of the combustion process which 
make  the  interactions  between  flow  and  flame  more 
unstable. However, the main findings of the previous 
case  are  confirmed.  In  fact,  we  find  that  during  the 
instability  state  all  the  attractors  have  genus  0, 
confirming that they have low entropy toroidal shape 
with  a  quasi-periodic  motion,  and  the  transition  
occurs  in  a  finite  time  interval,  supporting  the 
underlying  deterministic  evolution  and  feeding  the 
hopes about its predictability.

ABSTRACT

The  regional  phase  Lg  is  often  used  to  estimate  location  and  magnitude    for  sources  closer  than  1500  km.

The complexity of Lg waveforms makes it difficult to consistently determine a unique Lg arrival time, thus

affecting source location with a single station or array.  This study tests an automatic method for timing Lg

arrivals using wavelet transforms to decompose the Lg signal into its components localized both in time and

scale.

A  Continuous  Wavelet  Transform  (CWT)  using  a  Daubechies  order  two  (db2)  wavelet  is  applied  to  10

seconds of raw data containing the start of Lg.  Initial positioning of the window is obtained using standard

Lg travel time tables.  The coefficients at scale 16 from the db2 decomposition are squared and the resulting

time series is represented by an approximation of the 4'th level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) using a

Haar  wavelet.    A  threshold  detector  is  then  applied  to  the  resulting  time  series  to  determine  the  Lg  arrival

time. The method was tested using well located earthquakes and explosions from known mines ( mb < 4.0 ),

recorded on the vertical components at TXAR (Lajitas, Texas) and PDAR (Pinedale, Wyoming) arrays.  The

Lg arrival time was automatically picked with a standard deviation of less than 1.5 seconds (less than 10 km

location error) for well known locations.  Location errors are larger with the increase of distance and smaller

with the increase in signal to noise ratio of events.

INTRODUCTION

Lg is one of the most used regional phases, both in location and discrimination, and

dominant  for  many  events  up  to  1500  km  epicentral  distance.    Lg  is  made  up  of  short

period guided waves including scattering contributions from crustal heterogeneity, modeled

as  a  sequence  of  multiply  reflected  postcritical  shear  waves  trapped  in  the  crustal  wave-

guide (Xie and Lay, 1994), or as a superposition of higher mode surface waves (Herrmann

and Kijko, 1983; Bollinger, 1979).  The properties of the phase include a period of 1 to 7

seconds,  a  tendency  to  horizontal  polarization,  and  a  mean  surface  velocity  of  about  3.5

km/s (Herrin and Minton, 1960). The physical mechanism of Lg generation is still under

study  (Gupta  et  al.,1997;  Patton  and  Taylor,  1995;  Zhang  and  Lay,  1995;  Xie  and  Lay,

1994) and there is no widely accepted automatic way of picking its arrival.

Different  types  of  seismic  phase  detectors,  in  time-domain  and  frequency-domain

and using particle motion processing or pattern matching were previously developed (see

Withers et al., 1998, for a good review).  None of them have proved to be acceptable for all

situations.  In their paper, containing the study of an automated, near-real-time, waveform

correlation  event-detection  and  location  system,  Withers  et  al.,  (1998),  use  the  idea  of

detecting  transients  in  the  frequency  content  of  seismograms  for  one  of  the  digital

algorithms which they test in order to detect seismic phases for teleseismic events.  Their

solution was to use adaptive STA/LTA processing (variable length window function of the

3

dominant frequency of the signal) and they were able to enhance a large variety of phase

arrivals  over  a  wide  range  of  source,  path,  receiver  and  noise  scenarios.    However,  the

length  of  the  windows  used  affected  the  precision  of  their  estimates,  even  in  the  case  of

adaptive processing.  Envelope processing, suitable for cases when original waveforms are

very complex, was used by Husebye et al., (1998), in local event semi-automatic locations,

for a frequency band between 3 and 6 Hz. Their procedure, while simple and suitable for

real-time  monitoring  purposes,  was  also  affected  by  the  lack  of  resolution  due  to

windowing.    Wavelet  transform  methods  were  used  for  P  and  S  phase  identification  in

three  -  component  seismograms  by  Anant  and  Dowla  (1997).    Assuming  that  strong

features of the seismic signal appear in the wavelet coefficients across several scales, they

used a multi-scalar representation to construct “locator” functions that identify the P and S

arrivals  and  developed  the  first  detector  based  on  an  alternative  method  of  signal

processing using wavelet decomposition of the signal.

We present an automatic method of picking Lg phases based on detecting transients

in  frequency  content  of  seismograms  and  obtain  the  envelopes  of  the  waveforms  with  a

discrete wavelet decomposition method.  The wavelet analysis is a windowing technique,

with variable sized regions, that allows the use of long time intervals in instances for which

we  want  precise  low  frequency  information  and  shorter  intervals  where  we  want  high

frequency information.  The method is based on the capacity of the wavelet transform for

detecting  changes  in  the  nature  of  a  process  and  to  express  frequency  (scale)  content

changing  in  time,  which  is  not  possible  with  Fourier  analysis  or  even  windowed  Fourier

analysis (Misiti et al., 1996; Strang and Nguyen, 1996).  We make the assumption that Lg,

being  composed  of  surface  waves  following  the  P  and  S  coda,  constitutes  a  change  in

4

process and is likely to be seen as a change of pattern in the time - scale representation of

the  continuous  wavelet  transform  (CWT).    We  also  assume  that  the  Lg  duration  on  the

seismogram is of the order of at least 3 seconds, based on the fact that the formation of Lg

requires a significant amount of energy propagating as shear waves trapped in the crustal

wave - guide (see also Xie and Lay, 1994).  The automatic detection method was tested on

events  recorded  at  two  arrays:  TXAR  (Lajitas,  Texas)  and  PDAR  (Pinedale,  Wyoming).

The location and station configuration of the arrays are presented in Figure 1.

THE DATA

The data set of small magnitude events (  mbLg  < 4.0 ) consists of explosions from

four mining districts and aftershocks of the April 14, 1995, mw = 5.8 Alpine (West Texas)

earthquake,  recorded  at  TXAR,  and  of  a  set  of  explosions  from  Black  Thunder  Mine

(Powder  River  Basin,  Wyoming),  recorded  at  PDAR.    The  data  from  the  vertical

component  of  one  of  the  elements  TX08  or  TX09  at  TXAR  and  PD03  at  PDAR  were

analyzed  for  each  event.    Locations  of  the  earthquakes  and  of  the  mines,  the  mine  status

(multiple  mines  or  single  mine),  the  distance  and  backazimuth  to  the  respective  array,  as

well as the number of events used in this study are presented in Table 1.  Locations relative

to TXAR and PDAR of the events used to assess the Lg detector are presented in Figure 2.

Red squares are mine locations, the blue square represents the Alpine aftershocks locations.

5

The  16  Alpine  aftershocks  were  located  by  USGS  (Preliminary  Determination  of

Epicenters Catalog) northeast of TXAR, at a distance of 108 km, backazimuth 19 degrees.

They were used because they are well located relative to the main shock.

Two  clusters  of  mines  were  found  in  Mexico  south  and  southeast  of  TXAR  by

Sorrells  et  al.  (1997).    For  the  21  events  from  Minas  de  Hercules  iron  mines,  Mexico

(approximately  150  km  distance  from  TXAR,  185  degrees  backazimuth)  and  22  events

from MICARE (Minera Carbonifera de Rio Escondito, Mexico), at approximately 329 km

from  TXAR,  backazimuth  110  degrees,  we  did  not  have  ground  truth.    We  believe  that

these events originate from a number of mines for which we do not have precise locations.

Nine  explosions  from  the  copper  mine  at  Tyrone,  New  Mexico  (579  km  distance

from  TXAR,  311  degrees  backazimuth)  were  confirmed  by  the  engineers  at  the  mine  as

either  simultaneous  or  delay  fired  blasts.    From  the  Morenci  copper  mine,  Southeastern

Arizona,  (681  km  from  TXAR,  backazimuth  309  degrees),  8  confirmed  delay  fired

explosions were analyzed.

The seven events from the Black Thunder  mine,  at 360 km distance from PDAR,

backazimuth 73 degrees, were well documented blasts (Stump and Pearson, 1997) located

in the same pit; one was a simultaneous explosion, the others were delay fired explosions.

Bonner  et  al,  (1997),  observed  that  a  relatively  smaller  yield  in  a  simultaneous

explosion from Tyrone produced a similar Lg magnitude to a larger delay fired explosion.

For this reason we did not use the magnitude to characterize the events, but the signal to

noise ratio (SNR) instead.  For this study, the SNR is defined as the ratio of the sum of the

squares of the coefficients of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) at scale 16 in a 5

seconds window after and immediately before the Lg arrival.

THE METHOD

Wavelets and Fourier Analysis

Fourier analysis assumes that the spectral content of the data does not change with

time within the analysis window.  Thus frequencies present at one time are presumed to be

present  with  the  same  intensities  at  all  times.    In  fact,  the  time  varying  spectrum  is

undefined in Fourier analysis.  However, seismic data is clearly time-varying in frequency,

a  fact  that  has  been  realized  for  some  time.    Previous  researchers  have  addressed  this

problem  by  computing  Fourier  spectra  with  overlapping  windows  and  piecing  them

together. Such an approach is not altogether satisfactory, is costly in computation time and

difficult to optimize, although it is headed in the right direction - the direction of wavelet

analysis.  In wavelet analysis, unlike the Fourier transform which is global in frequency and

independent  of  time,  the  wavelet  transform  is  a  localized  transform  in  space  (time)  and

scale  (generalized  frequency).    Figure  3  is  an  example  of  both  transforms  applied  to  a

signal  containing  the  same  frequencies  superposed  as  in  Figure  3  a,  or  successive  as  in

Figure  3  b.    The  sampling  rate  is  40  samples/second  and  a  Hanning  window  is  applied

before  calculation  of  the  Fast  Fourier  Transform  presented  in  subplots  2a  and  2b.    The

Daubechies order 10 (db10) continuous wavelet transform ( see Misiti et al., 1996; Strang

and  Nguyen,  1996),  in  subplots  3a  and  respectively  3b,  shows  the  frequency  content

changing in time, which is not possible to identify in the  Fourier analysis.  The y axis in

7

subplots 3a and 3b represents the scale; low scales correspond to high frequencies, larger

scales correspond to low frequencies.

A  first  approach  to  the  problem  of  obtaining  the  frequency  content  of  a  process

locally  in  time  was  a  windowing  technique  applied  to  the  signal,  called  the  Short  Time

Fourier Transform (STFT) that maps a signal into a two-dimensional function of time and

frequency  (Chui,  1997;  Kumar  and  Foufoula-Georgiou,  1996). 

  However, 

the

time/frequency  window  of  the  STFT  is  fixed  and  hence  unsuitable  for  detecting  signals

with both high and/or low frequencies.

In  essence,  wavelet  analysis  is  an  extension  of  the  STFT  in  such  a  way  that  the

time/frequency  window  is  no  longer  fixed,  but  can  be  varied.    The  use  of  long  time

intervals  where  we  want  more  precise  low  frequency  information  and  shorter  intervals

where we want high frequency information is accomplished through the introduction of a

location parameter and a scale parameter as opposed to the Fourier method which has only

a scale parameter.  One of the two parameters is the translation or location parameter as in

the windowed Fourier transform case.  The other parameter is a dilation or scale parameter,

the latter corresponding to the frequency ω  in the Fourier case.

A major advantage of analyzing a signal with wavelets as the analyzing kernels is

that it allows for the study of signal features locally with a detail matched to their scale, i.e.

broad features at a large scale and fine features on small scales.  This property is especially

useful  for  signals  that  are  non-stationary,  have  short-lived  transient  components,  have

features  at  different  scales  or  have  singularities,  discontinuities  in  higher  derivatives  and

self-similarity (Kumar and Foufoula-Georgiou, 1996).

8

Basic wavelets theory

The  essence  of  wavelet  analysis  is  to  expand  a  given  function  f(t)  as  a  sum  of

‘elementary’  functions  called  wavelets.    Wavelets  are  functions  that  satisfy  certain

requirements.    The  name  wavelet  comes  from  the  two  requirements  that  they  should

integrate to zero, waving above and below the x-axis and that the function has to be well

localized.    A  wavelet  is  a  waveform  of  effectively  limited  duration  that  has  an  average

value of zero.  They tend to be irregular and asymmetric (see Strang and Nguyen, 1996).

The wavelets are themselves derived from a single function ψ , called the mother

wavelet, by translations and dilations (Priestley, 1996).  The mother wavelet is chosen so

that it satisfies the following conditions:

ψ(t)dt = 0

ψ(t)

dt < ¥

2

(ω)

ω

dω < ¥

    

where   

(ω)  is the Fourier transform of     ψ(t)  and  Y

( )0

0= .  The mother wavelet is ‘well

localized’ and decays ‘quickly’ to zero at a suitable rate (has compact support).

A classical mother wavelet is the Haar function defined by:

and shown in Figure 4, subplot 1.  The Haar wavelet is not continuous, therefore the choice

of  the  Haar  basis  for  representing  smooth  functions,  for  example,  is  not  natural  and

economic.  However, when looking for a sudden change in the signal, the Haar wavelet is

recommended (Misiti et al., 1996).

Given a mother wavelet, a doubly infinite sequence of wavelets can be constructed

by applying varying degrees of translations and dilations to the mother wavelet.

For real a, b (a „ 0)

ψa ,b (t) = a

so that the parameter a, usually restricted to positive values, represents the scale parameter

and b the translation parameter.  The normalizing factor 

 is included so that

This equality is always true for     a > 0.

  Figure  4,  subplot  2  presents  the  compactly-supported  wavelet  db2  of  Ingrid

Daubechies  (named  Daubechies  order  two  wavelet).  The  names  of  the  Daubechies

wavelets  (  see  Misiti  et.  al,  1996)  are  written  dbN,  where  N  is  the  order  and  db  the

ìsurnameî of the wavelet.

Selection of the wavelet shape is an important decision.  Each may show a part of

the reality with specificity, and each may reveal something that the others had concealed.

Choosing the wavelet is an advantage of the wavelet application and it allows for flexibility

to  adjust  the  analysis  depending  on  the  signal  type,  but  there  is  no  generally  accepted

procedure  for  doing  so.    Anant  and  Dowla  (1997),  for  P  and  S  arrivals,  matched  the

wavelets with the arrival shape to help locate the arrival in the seismic signal.  They also

(cid:242)
(cid:242)
10

used a pseudo-wavelet constructed from the P arrival shape to locate the S arrival.  The Lg

arrival is too complicated for this procedure, so that we used a very simple wavelet, db2,

composed  of  only  one  cycle,  for  our  study.    Also,  for  the  best  characterization  of  the

beginning of the Lg arrival, the Haar wavelet (db1) was considered the most suitable.

. Wavelet analysis

As  Fourier  analysis  consists  of  breaking  up  a  signal  into  sine  waves  of  various

frequencies,  wavelet  analysis  is  the  breaking  up  of  a  signal  into  shifted  (translated)  and

scaled  (dilated  or  compressed)  versions  of  the  mother  wavelet,  each  multiplied  by  an

appropriate  coefficient.    Any  function      f(t) ˛ L
2 ,  the  space  of  square  integrable  functions,
{
ψa,b (t )
    

can be expressed as a linear superposition of 

}.

The process of Fourier analysis is represented by the Fourier transform:

f (t)e-

iωtdt

F(ω) =
    

which is the sum over all time of the signal f(t) multiplied by a complex exponential.  The

Fourier coefficients F(ω), when multiplied by a sinusoid of appropriate frequency ω, yield

the constituent sinusoidal components of the original signal.

Similarly,  the  Continuous  Wavelet  Transform  (CWT)  is  defined  as  the  sum  over

time of the signal multiplied by scaled, shifted versions of the wavelet function ψ :

C ( scale, position) =

f (t)ψa,b (t)

dt

 where C are the wavelet coefficients, functions of scale and position, which multiplied by

the appropriated scaled and shifted wavelet yields the constituent wavelets of the original

11

signal ( Misiti et al., 1996).  The continuous wavelet transform can operate at every scale

and  the  analyzing  wavelet  is  shifted  smoothly  over  the  full  domain  of  the  analyzing

function.    This  distinguishes  it  from  the  Discrete  Wavelet  Transform  (DWT).    A  good

review of theoretical aspects related to DWT was presented by Anant and Dowla, (1997)

and Priestley, (1996).

The  advantage  of  the  DWT  is  that,  using  dyadic  scales  and  positions  (based  on

powers of two) the analysis is more efficient and not redundant.  For fixed values a0 and b0,

if  a = a0

m, b = nb0a0

m, n,m = 0,– 1, – 2,... ,    and  for  a0  =  1/2  and  b0  =  1,  the  Daubechies

discrete wavelet family is:

    ψm,n (t) = 2

m / 2ψ(2

mt - n)

.

  This  class  of  wavelets  forms  a  complete  orthonormal  basis  for  the  space  of  square

integrable functions, so f(t) admits the representation:

  The mother wavelet ψ( )t

 is dilated by the factor 2-m and translated to the position n • 2-m.

    ψm , n (t)  is “localized” around the time point t = n  • 2-m and hence the wavelet coefficient

    cm, n  depends only on the local properties of f(t) in the neighborhood of t = n • 2-m.  A very

practical  filtering  algorithm  developed  in  1988  by  Mallat  (see  Misiti  et  al.,  1996;  Strang

and Nguyen, 1996) yields a fast wavelet transform.  Two filters, high pass and low pass,

are  used  to  obtain  respectively  the  detail  (D)  and  the  approximation  (A)  of  the  signal.

Downsampling  (  throwing  away  every  second  data  point)  is  introduced  to  keep  the  total

12

number  of  data  points  constant.    The  decomposition  process  can  be  iterated,  with

successive approximations (A) being decomposed in turn, so that the signal is broken down

into many lower resolution components (the wavelet decomposition tree).  A disadvantage

of DWT, from a seismological point of view, is the downsampling steps that result in the

length of detail j+1, j‡ 1, j ˛

 N being half the length of detail j (see also Anant and Dowla,

1997).  As an example, for a signal with a sampling rate of 40 samples/second, detail 1 and

approximation 1 will have 20 samples/sec, and detail 4 and approximation 4 will have 2.5

samples  /second.    When  looking  for  the  overall  trend  of  the  signal,  equivalent  to  its

behavior  at  low  frequencies,  the  trend  is  more  clear  with  each  approximation,  when  j

increases,  and  there  is  a  trade-off  between  the  resolution  (sampling  rate)  and  the

smoothness of the approximation.

Scaling a wavelet means stretching or compressing it.  In wavelet analysis the scale

factor is also related to the frequency of the signal.  Higher scales correspond to the most

ìstretchedî  wavelets  and  the  coefficients  measure  coarse  signal  features.    Low  scales

correspond to compressed wavelets which analyze rapidly changing details associated with

high frequencies.  The fact that the wavelet basis functions are indexed by two parameters

(a, b or m, n) whereas the Fourier basis functions are indexed by the single parameter ω,

means that wavelet transforms (or coefficients) are characteristics of the local behavior of

the  function  whereas  the  Fourier  transforms  (or  coefficients)  are  characteristics  of  the

global behavior of the function.

The  concept  of  “frequency”  is  related  purely  to  the  complex  exponential  function

and  has  no  precise  meaning  when  applied  to  other  families  of  functions,  unless  a  more

general  concept  of  “frequency”  can  be  defined  (Priestley,  1996).    In  a  loose  sense,  the

13

wavelet  parameters  a,  b,  or  m,  n  may  be  identified  with  generalized  frequency  and  with

time:  when  parameter  a  decreases,  the  “oscillations”  become  compressed  in  the  time

domain, i. e., they exhibit “high frequency” behavior, and as  the parameter a increases, the

“oscillations” exhibit ìlow frequencyî behavior.

The method

A plot of typical raw waveforms from all locations is presented in Figure 5.  The

first five (5) subplots represent events recorded at TXAR.  Subplot 6 represents an event

recorded  at  PDAR.    The  search  window  of  10  seconds  (400  samples)  is  also  represented

and  the  amplitude  in  nanometres  @  1  second  is  counts  x  0.0073 for  TXAR  and

counts  x  0.005  for PDAR.

A continuous wavelet transform is applied to the raw data, for a scale from 1 to 20,

with step 1, using the db2 wavelet.  We used the db2 CWT in order to maintain constant

sample  rate  of  the  signal.    The  method  is  illustrated  in  Figures  6-9  which  show  the

processing steps for two Tyrone events recorded at the station TX08.  Figure 6 shows the

October 11, 1996 simultaneous explosion and Figure 8 shows the September 9, 1997 delay

fired  explosion.    In  Figures  6  and  8,  subplot  1  contains  the  raw  data,  with  the  mean

removed,  for  each  of  the  two  explosions  at  Tyrone.    The  x  axis  represents  samples  (40

samples/sec) in all subplots.  Absolute values of the CWT coefficients using db2 wavelet

are presented in subplot 2 of each figure.  The y axis represents scale.  The color of each

point represents the magnitude of the wavelet coefficient.  Light colors correspond to large

14

coefficients, dark colors correspond to small coefficients.  Low scales are indicative of high

frequency, high scales are indicative of low frequency.  A clear change in color marks the

Lg arrival.

The coefficients at scale 16 were empirically chosen as the best to be analyzed for

all the events.  The range of frequency they correspond to is 0.9 to 2.1 Hz, centered on 1.5

Hz (see Chui, 1997) , which is a band with significant energy in the Lg Fourier spectrum

for all the events in this study as well as for events from other regions.  As an example, the

corner frequency for events with magnitude less than 4.0 in Eastern Canada, for distances

between  100  and  900  km,  was  calculated  by  Hasegawa,  (1983)  to  be  higher  than  2  Hz.

Also, 1 sec period Lg waves were used by Nuttli (1986) for estimating seismic magnitudes

because their anelastic attenuation is small in shield and other geologically stable regions.

Studies of the decay of spectral energy of Lg waves with distance for different frequencies

and  different  regions  generally  show  a  less  rapid  decay  in  the  range  of  0.5  Hz  to  2  Hz

(Campillo et al., 1985; Herrmann et al., 1997).  Subplot 3 of both Figures 6 and 8 presents

the coefficients at scale 16 ( the sampling rate of the initial signal is preserved).

Figures  7  and  9  represent  the  continuation  of  the  analysis  of  the  Tyrone  events.

Squared coefficients at scale 16 are presented in subplot 1 of each figure. The 10 sec search

window  for  Lg  is  expanded  in  subplot  2  for  each  event.    A  discrete  Haar  wavelet

decomposition of the signal in subplot 1 is performed and the approximation at level 4 in

the  10  seconds  search  window  is  represented  in  subplot  3  in  Figures  7  and  9.    The  time

series are  normalized  to  the  maximum  value  of  Lg  amplitude  over  a  15  second  window,

starting  at  the  same  point  as  the  10  second  search  window.    The  level  4,  selected

empirically,  using  a  trial  and  error  procedure,  has  a  sampling  rate  of  2.5  samples/second

15

and an initial error in picking the Lg arrival of 0.4 seconds representing an error in distance

estimated from Lg minus P times of approximately 2.5 to 2.8 km.

An  empirically  chosen  0.25  threshold  detector  is  applied  in  determining  the  Lg

arrival time for all the events.  The threshold was chosen as the one that gives lowest Lg

minus P travel time standard deviations for all locations.  The 0.25 threshold exceeds the

mean plus one standard deviation of the detail 5, (the ìnoiseî for the approximation at level

4), normalized to the maximum of approximation at level 4 for the majority of the events.

The detector includes a checking algorithm designed to verify that the amplitude of

the Lg envelope exceeds the threshold for several seconds.  For each envelope value that

exceeds the threshold, a linear interpolation is performed in a 4 seconds window centered

on the respective time, and if at least 70% of the values exceed the threshold, the point is

considered  to  be  the  time  of  Lg  arrival.    This  procedure  is  designed  to  eliminate  the

possibility of picking S arrivals coming before Lg and is based on the assumption that the

Lg duration is at least 3 seconds.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The standard deviation of the Lg and P arrival time difference, expressed in km, for

each location as a function of the distance to the respective array is presented in Figure 10.

Table  1  presents  the  numerical  values  of  the  standard  deviation  (km)  for  each  location.

The standard deviation was calculated with the formulas:

16

σd

= 7.58* σD

tLg - P

(km) for Pg first arrival, i.e. for the Alpine aftershocks and for the Minas

de Hercules events and

σd

= 6.22 *(6.5 +σD

t Lg - P ) (km) for Pn first arrival for all the other events, where  D

tLg - P

is  the  travel  time  difference  between  the  Lg  and  P  arrivals.    The  Lg  arrival  time  was

automatically picked with a standard deviation of less than 10 km for all the single mines.

The Mexico mines, considered to be multiple mines, have standard deviations greater than

10 km and less than 15 km.

The plot of the standard deviation as a function of Lg SNR threshold, in Figure 11,

for  all  the  single  mine  locations  generally  shows  smaller  errors  with  increase  in  SNR.

However for larger SNR fewer events were considered.  There is no significant variation in

the standard deviation with SNR for the Alpine aftershocks.

The  raw  data  with  the  mean  removed  for  the  October  11,  1996  simultaneous

explosion at Tyrone are presented in Figure 12, subplot 1.  Subplot 2 shows the db2 CWT

coefficients at scale 16 and the waveforms filtered between 0.9 and 2.1 Hz are presented in

subplot 3.  A zero phase, forward and reverse, 4’th order Butterworth filter was applied on

the  raw  data  in  subplot  1  and,  due  to  the  very  narrow  frequency  range,  the  resulting

waveforms  loose  features.    Also,  the  amplitude  difference  between  the  Lg  signal  and  the

ìnoiseî before Lg is much less than in the case of wavelet coefficients.  We conclude that

the wavelet transform is a more efficient way of filtering data in narrow frequency bands.

Comparing the shapes of the Lg envelopes for the simultaneously fired and for the

delay fired explosion at Tyrone (Figures 7 and 9, subplots 3) it is seen that the Lg signal

from  the  simultaneous  explosion  is  impulsive,  followed  by  an  exponential  decay,  like  a

delta function convolved with an exponential, while the delay fired Lg is emergent, like a

17

boxcar convolved with an exponential.  The same difference in shape is observed for the

approximations of Lg squared CWT coefficients for the events at Black Thunder Mine, not

only at scale 16, but also for the raw data.  We compare in Figure 13 two Black Thunder

events, a simultaneous explosion and a delay fired explosion.  The raw data with the mean

removed for the August 24, 1995 simultaneous explosion is presented in subplot 1 and the

raw data with the mean removed of the delay fired explosion on June 23, 1995 is presented

in subplot 3.  The Haar approximation at level 4 of the squared CWT coefficients at scale

16, in subplots 2 and 4, is different for each type of explosion; i.e., a sharp increase in Lg

for the simultaneous explosion and a less rapid rise of Lg followed by a slower decay of

amplitude  for  the  delay  fired  blast.    If  the  length  of  the  boxcar  could  be  considered

proportional to the duration of the source, then it is possible that this type of analysis could

be  used  as  a  discriminant  between  simultaneous  explosions  and  delay  fired  explosions,

provided  that  both  occur  in  the  same  location.    It  could  also  be  an  additional  tool  for

discrimination between simultaneous and delay fired explosions besides the study of long

period regional surface waves, described by Stump and Pearson (1997), applicable for the

large cast shots in same data set.

CONCLUSIONS

The automatic method for determination of Lg arrival times presented here results

in a location error of about 10 km or less for events at epicentral distances from 360 km up

to 700 km.  Larger location errors at the Micare coal mines and the Minas de Hercules iron

18

mines are probably caused by the existence of clusters of mines.  A future study will focus

on the statistical discrimination of individual mines in such a cluster.

The  method  described here allows  extraction  of  meaningful  signal  attributes  from

single  station  vertical  records  using  a  set  of  conditions  of  which  many  are  empirically

established.  The  use  of  different  wavelets  and,  specifically,  different  scales  will  be

investigated  in  future  studies.    An  automatic  method  to  choose  the  threshold  for  the

threshold  detector  as  well  as  a  better  way  of  recognizing  Lg  than  linear  interpolation  are

under study.

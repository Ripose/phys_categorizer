Abstract.  We  propose  a  simple  relativistic  derivation  of  the  electric  and  the  magnetic 
fields generated by an electric point charge moving with constant velocity. Our approach 
is  based  on  the  radar  detection  of  the  point  space  coordinates  where  the  fields  are 
measured. The same equations were previously derived in a relatively complicated way2 
based exclusively on general electromagnetic field equations and without making use of 
retarded potentials or relativistic equations. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Heaviside1  obtained  the  expressions  for  the  electric  and  magnetic 
 
fields produced by an electric point charge q moving with constant velocity 
V given by

where r is the distance between the point of observation and the charge, c is 
 is the angle between r and V. 
the velocity of light and 
Jefimenko2 presents the ways in which (1) and (2) could be  derived. 
 
Among  the  four  different  approaches  that  he  mentions,  one  particular 
approach  is  based  on  applying  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations  of  space-
time  coordinates  and  fields  to  a  stationary  point  charge.3  He  considers  that 
this  method  is  fairly  simple  mathematically,  but  it  doesn’t  fit  into  the 
classical theory of electromagnetism. 
 

In the literature covering this subject we found the following formulas

The  purpose  of  our  paper  is  to  present  the  relativistic  derivations  of 
(1) and (2) and of (3) and (4) in a simple and transparent way showing the 
difference between the physics behind them. We start with the hints that the 
relativists always have in mind: 
  When  you  speak  about  a  physical  quantity  then  always  define  it 
 
without ambiguity mentioning the observer who measures it, the measuring 
devices he uses and where and when he performs this measurement. 
 
 
moving with constant velocity. 
The  scenario  we  propose  involves  the  inertial  reference  frames 
 
K(XOY) and K'(X'O'Y') with parallel axes, K' moving with constant speed V 
relative  to  K  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  common  OX(O'X')  axes.  At  a 
time  t=t'=0  the  origins  O  and  O'  coincide  in  space.  A  point  charge  q  is  at 
rest  in  K'  being  located  at  its  origin  O'  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  electric  
field  generated  by  this  charge  (stationary  in  K')  is  measured  at  a  point 
 located 
at this point. Assuming that the Coulomb’s law holds true in the rest frame 
of the charge, then the point charge q creates a radial electric field in K'

In its rest frame K' the charge doesn’t’ generate a magnetic field thus B'=0.

It  is  customary  in  special  relativity  to  express  the  right  sides  of  (10) 
and  (11)  as  a  function  of  physical  quantities  measured  in  K.  Because  the 
charge is a velocity independent physical quantity, a fact best proved by the 
neutrality  of  an  atom  inside  which  negative  electrons  move  with  different 
values around the positive nucleus, the only thing we have to do is to express

In  a  second  approach,  which  is  more  in  the  spirit  of  classical 
electromagnetism,  we  consider  that  the  information  about  the  fact  that 
charge q arrives at t'=0 at point O'(0,0) propagates in free space with speed c

By  this  simple  deduction  we  recover  Jefimenko’s  result2.  However  his 
original  deduction  appears  to  us  as  a  veritable  “tour-de-force”  involving  a 
great number of intermediary steps.

The  magnetic  field  can  be  calculated  using  the  well  known  formula 

 
 
that relates the electric and the magnetic field 
 
 
 
We consider that our second approach to derive the space coordinates 
of  the  point  where  the  field  is  measured  involving  a  radar  detection 
procedure  is  more  in  the  spirit  of  electrodynamics  than  the  first  approach 
involving  the  simultaneous  detection  of  the  moving  rod  coordinates5.  We 
also  point  out  that  the  radar  detection  shares  much  in  common  with  the 
concept of retardation. 
 
Conclusions 
 
We  have  presented  a  new  method  to  calculate  the  electric  and 
 
magnetic  fields  generated  by  an  electric  charge  moving  with  constant 
velocity.  Our  method  is  based  on  the  radar  detection  of  the  point  space 
coordinates where the fields are measured. This calculation is much simpler  
than  an  alternative  approach2  based  exclusively  on  general  electromagnetic 
equations  which  doesn’t  make  use  of  retarded  potentials  or  relativistic 
equations. In accordance with a hint of Ockham we propose the use of our 
simpler  deduction  in  teaching  relativistic  electrodynamics  as  it  is  more 
transparent and time saving.

An array of pairs of parallel gold nanorods is shown to have a negative refractive 

index in the optical range, close to a wavelength of 1 µm. Such behaviour results 

from the plasmon resonance in the pairs of nanorods for both the electric and 

magnetic components of light. The metal rods act as inductive elements whereas 

the dielectric gaps perform as capacitive elements, forming an optical LC-circuit. 

Here we report both experiments and simulations that demonstrate a resonant 

behaviour for the index of refraction. Above the resonance, the refractive index 

becomes negative. Paired metal nanorods open new opportunities for developing 

negative-refraction materials in optics. 

One of the most fundamental notions in optics is that of refractive index, which gives 

the factor by which the phase velocity of light is decreased in a material compared to 

vacuum conditions. Negative-index materials (NIMs) have a negative refractive index 

so that electromagnetic waves in such media propagate in a direction opposite to the 

flow of energy, which is indeed unusual and counterintuitive. There are no known 

naturally-occurring NIMs. However, artificially designed materials (metamaterials) that 

can act as NIMs have recently been proposed. Metamaterials can open new avenues to 

achieving unprecedented physical properties and functionality unattainable with 

naturally-existing materials. Proof-of-principle experiments1 have shown that

metamaterials can act as NIMs at microwave wavelengths. NIMs drew a large amount 

of attention after Pendry predicted that NIMs with a refractive index 

n = −  can act, at 

1

least in principle, as a ‘perfect lens’ allowing imaging resolution which is limited not by 

the wavelength but rather by material quality2. Materials with structural units much 

smaller than the wavelength can be characterized by a dielectric permittivity

refraction4. In the latter case, light induces in the NIM an electric displacement and a 

magnetic induction, which are directed against the incident electric and magnetic fields, 

respectively. 

NIMs with negative refraction in the optical range could have applications that are 

particularly spectacular, encompassing such areas as nanophotonics, nanolithography, 

and biomedical sensing and imaging. However, while negative permittivity in the 

optical range is easy to attain for metals, there is no magnetic response for naturally-

occurring materials at such high frequencies. Two recent experiments employing 

lithographically-fabricated double and single split-ring resonators showed that a 

magnetic response and negative permeability can be accomplished in the terahertz5 and 

100 terahertz6 spectral ranges. These experiments were a breakthrough in the field and 

showed the feasibility of NIMs in the optical range because a negative magnetic 

response is a precursor for negative refraction. However, the ultimate goal of negative 

refraction was not accomplished in either of these two important experiments. Below 

we report our observation of a negative refractive index for the optical range, 

specifically, for the wavelengths close to 1 µm (300 THz frequency). The NIM 

structural design we used closely follows our recent theoretical prediction of negative 

refraction in a layer of pairs of parallel metal nanorods7, 8.

Figure 1a schematically shows the array of closely-spaced pairs of parallel metal 

nanorods used in our experiments. The two parallel rods form an open current loop, 

which acts as a transmission line and has a current resonance. Such a loop is ‘closed’ 

through the displacement current (blue arrows in Fig. 1a), and it therefore supports the 

resonant modes of both the electric and magnetic components of light. For normally-

incident light with the electric field polarized along the rods and the magnetic field 

perpendicular to the pair, the electric and magnetic responses both can experience a 

resonant behaviour at certain frequencies that depend on the rod dimensions and their 

separations7, 8. In this design, the electric component of the incident wave excites a 

symmetric current mode in the two metal rods, whereas the magnetic field component 

excites an anti-symmetric mode (see Fig. 1a). The excitation of such plasmon 

resonances for both the electric and magnetic light components results in the resonant 

response of the refractive index, which can become negative above the resonance as 

previously predicted7, 8. This resonance can be thought of as a resonance in an optical 

LC-circuit, where the metal rods act as inductive elements L and the dielectric gaps 

between the rods act as capacitive elements C. 

Experimental results were obtained using a 2 mm × 2 mm array of nanorods. Fig. 

1b shows a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) image of a portion 

of the sample as well as a closer view of a single pair of rods. A schematic for the whole 

sample is given in Fig. 1c, and the details of manufacturing are described in the 

Methods section. 

The optical characteristics of the periodic array of metal rods shown in Fig. 1a 

were simulated using a 3D finite difference time domain (FDTD) formulation, where 

the rectangular elementary cell of Fig. 1c represented the properties of the entire sample 

(for details, see the Methods section).

Figure 2 presents the results of our experimental measurements of transmittance 

(top), and reflectance (bottom) for light propagating through the sample and substrate 

described above. The scattering and diffraction of light for our sample was negligible.

Figure 2 Transmittance T (a and b) and reflectance R (c and d) of light for 

the layer of pairs of parallel gold nanorods placed on a substrate of ITO-

coated glass. Two different polarizations of light are used, one with the 

electric field along the rods ((cid:38)), as in a and c, and one normal to the rods (⊥), 

as in b and d. The transmittance of the whole sample is normalized by the 

transmittance of the substrate (ITO-coated glass) for both polarizations.

spectrophotometer from Perkin-Elmer using linearly polarized light. Two different light 

polarizations have been used, one with the electric field parallel (Figs. 2a and 2c) and 

the other with the electric field perpendicular (Figs. 2b and 2d) to the nanorod pair 

major axis. The transmission spectra are collected at normal incidence, and the 

reflection spectra are measured at a small incident angle of 8°. The divergence angle of 

the incident beam is up to ~15°. The transmittance for the whole sample is normalized 

by the transmittance of the substrate for both light polarizations. The measured 

frequency dependence of the substrate formed by ITO-coated glass is described with 

very high precision by the Drude formula (see also Methods and Supplementary 

Information). The refractive index of glass is 1.5. 

As seen in Fig. 2, the system of parallel gold nanorods shows a strong plasmonic 

resonance near 1.3 µm for light with the electric field polarized parallel to the rods. In 

this case, light excites both electric and magnetic responses such that the refractive 

index can become negative above the resonance. For light with the electrical field 

polarized perpendicular to the rods, only the electric (transverse) plasmon resonance is 

excited, with a resonant wavelength near 800 nm. The magnetic response is negligible 

in this case, and the refractive index is positive for all wavelengths. 

We note good qualitative agreement between our 3D FDTD simulations and 

experimental data – both the positions and the widths of the resonances are reproduced 

well. The observed difference in magnitudes at some wavelengths is related to 

insufficient spatial resolution of the grid used in our simulations. The grid size in 

simulations was 10 nm; a higher resolution would be beyond the computational 

capabilities of available computers. Yet, for simulations of metals in the optical range, 

which is known to be a hard problem, the accomplished level of agreement is very 

good.

To investigate the negative refraction of our material, we also used polarization 

and walk-off interferometers. These interference methods are capable of revealing that 

the light phase is advanced in NIMs, rather than being delayed as in normal, positive-

index materials. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 3. In the polarization 

interferometer, two optical channels have a common geometrical path and differ by the 

polarization of light. This allows one to measure the phase difference between 

orthogonally-polarized waves  φ

rods was used as the reference. Both the reference and the sample beams go through 

ITO-coated glass used as the substrate so that the phase acquired in the substrate does 

not contribute to the measured phase shift  δφ  if the substrate has no variations in 

optical thickness. The walk-off effect in calcite crystals is employed to separate the two 

beams and then bring them together to produce interference. The phase shifts  δφ(cid:38)  and 

δφ⊥  are measured for the two light polarizations, and their difference are compared 

with the phase anisotropy  φ∆ obtained from polarization interferometry (note that 

∆ =

). The instrumental error of the phase anisotropy measurement by 

polarization interferometer is ±1.7°. We note that variations in the substrate thickness 

do not affect the results of our phase anisotropy measurements, which is typical for 

common path interferometers. In the case of the walk-off interferometer, the thickness 

variation gives an additional source of error, causing an increase in the error for the 

absolute phase shift measurements up to ±4°.  

Figure 3 shows a very strong effect for our sample, with the phase difference

at λ ≈ 1.2 µm. As seen in Fig. 3, in the spectral range between 1 

and 1.6 µm the absolute phase shift  δφ⊥  measured with respect to the layer of air is 

positive and nearly flat (close to +10°) in magnitude. This means that the refractive 

index is positive and light is delayed in this case. In contrast,  δφ(cid:38)  shows a strong 

resonant dependence such that the difference  δφ

δφ⊥−(cid:38)

 agrees very well with our 

measurements of  φ∆  using polarization interferometry. For λ ≈ 1.2 µm, the phase 

advancement in the layer of nanorods with respect to the layer of air of the same 

thickness becomes very large (

δφ ≈ − °
40

). For a material with a metal filling factor of 

(cid:38)

only 8.3% and an overall structure thickness of about 165 nm, such phase advancement 

is indeed surprising and it indicates that the refractive index can be negative in this 

spectral range. 

9 

To find the refractive index we used Eq. (1) below, which provides the solution 

for retrieving the refractive index of a given thin layer of passive material (Im(n) > 0 

and Re(Z) > 0, where Z is the impedance) with unknown parameters9. Specifically, we 

obtain the impedance (not shown here) and the refractive index of the equivalent 

homogeneous layer with the same complex reflectance r and transmittance t as the 

actual array of nanorods, without the ITO + glass substrate. (Note that the T = |t|2 and R 

= |r|2 shown in Fig. 2 are the power transmittance and reflectance, respectively.) Such a 

homogeneous layer with equivalent n and Z gives the same far-field distribution outside 

the sample as the actual layer of metamaterial. 

The complex values of the reflected and transmitted electric fields, Er and Et, are 

calculated using 3D FDTD (see the Methods Section) for normally-incident light with

In Fig. 4 we show the refractive index obtained using the above retrieval 

procedure for two light polarizations: electric field parallel (Fig. 4a) and perpendicular 

(the insert of Fig. 4a) to the nanorod pair major axis. Clearly, the index of refraction has 

a resonant behaviour for the parallel polarization, which enables the coupling of the 

structure to both the electric and magnetic field components of the light. To estimate the 

possible error of the inversion (Eq. (1)), the standard deviation (σ) of the refractive

index was found using the deviation of reflected and transmitted fields obtained at the 

evaluation planes. Figure 4b shows a closer view of the wavelength domain for negative 

n with upper and lower boundaries of Re(n) ± σ. As seen in Fig. 4b, the effective 

refractive index is negative in the range between 1.1 µm and 1.4 µm, reaching the 

magnitude Re(n) ≈ −0.3 at λ ≈ 1.3 µm. 

For the perpendicular polarization, the magnetic response is negligible and the 

refractive index is always positive in this case (the insert of Fig. 4a). The two-peak 

structure in the insert can be explained by the interaction between the transverse 

plasmon oscillations in the two rods of a pair (the two overlapping peaks also can be 

traced in Figs. 2b and 2d). 

11 

We note that to introduce the effective dielectric permittivity ε(ω) and magnetic 

permeability µ(ω) depending only on frequency, the wavelength must be much larger 

than the dimensions of the elementary cell. This is not the case for our periodic structure 

of nanorods, where in general both µ and ε are tensors that depend on the quasi-

wavevector k. Accordingly, the effective-layer refractive index retrieved from Eq. (1) 

cannot be considered simply as the square root of the product of ε  and µ. However, as 

mentioned above, the refractive index and the impedance for the effective NIM layer 

reproduce the electric and magnetic fields outside the actual sample exactly, and hence 

the use of these effective parameters is fully justified. 

The relatively small magnitude of the negative refractive index obtained for our 

sample can indeed be enlarged by increasing the metal filling factor and by decreasing 

the separation of rods in the pairs7, 8. It is important to note that anomalously small 

refraction, |n| ≈ 0, is also of great interest because it can result in interesting phenomena 

such as the beaming effect, which provides conversion of divergent light into a highly 

collimated beam. 

The imaginary part of the refractive index also shows resonant behaviour and, for 

the parallel light polarization, it is rather large near the resonance. We note that by 

optimizing the system, losses can be significantly decreased. One of the possible ways 

to decrease losses is to fabricate structures much smaller than the wavelength so that the 

radiation loss would decrease. In accordance with this, loss is significantly lower for the 

perpendicular light polarization (Fig. 4b) because surface plasmon oscillations in this 

case occur along the smaller size (170 nm) of the system, normal to the nanorod major 

axis (note the smaller Im(n) and the narrower resonance width in the inset of Fig. 4a). 

The magnetic response of parallel nanorod pairs can be accomplished even for 

structures much smaller than the wavelength, which means that negative refraction with 

12 

lower loss Im(n) (and Re(n) < −1) can be obtained in this case10. Another possible way 

to decrease the effect of losses is to include an amplifying component into the NIM11, 12. 

In conclusion, for an array of pairs of parallel gold rods, we obtained a negative 

refractive index in the optical spectral range close to 1 µm. This is the first 

demonstration of negative refraction in the optical range. This new class of negative-

index materials is relatively easy to fabricate on the nanoscale. The frequency for 

negative refraction depends on both the size of metal rods and their separation. The 

negative-refraction frequency can span the visible and near-infrared parts of the 

spectrum through appropriate nanorod array design. Further optimization of the 

proposed structures would allow NIMs with lower losses and larger magnitudes of 

negative refraction, resulting in new applications based on this unique phenomenon. 

Methods 

Sample fabrication. A 2 mm × 2 mm array of nanorods was fabricated on a 180-nm 

layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) coated onto glass. Before applying the photo-resist for 

electron beam writing, the ITO-coated glass substrate was cleaned and baked at 160°C 

for 30 minutes. Next, a double layer of PMMA photo-resist was coated onto the ITO-

glass substrate. A JEOL JBX-6000FS electron beam writer with optimized dosage was 

used for writing. After the photo-resist was developed, the desired sandwich structure of 

metal rods and silicon dioxide (SiO2) was deposited in an electron beam evaporator at 

high vacuum. The thickness and sequence of the sandwich structure on the ITO-glass 

substrate are as follows: 5 nm of titanium (Ti), 50 nm of gold (Au), 5 nm of Ti, 50 nm 

of SiO2, 5 nm of Ti and finally 50 nm of Au. A lift-off process was then performed to 

obtain the array of paired nanorods. 

The fabrication resulted in rods that were trapezoidal in shape (with a top-down 

width difference of 20 nm for each rod) and had the sizes and separations specified in 

13 

Fig. 1c. Figure 1c shows the sizes (750 nm ×170 nm) of the bottom rods; the top rods 

are different in size and are 670 nm × 90 nm. This size difference is clearly seen in Fig. 

1b for the single rod pair. 

Simulation techniques. The core FDTD techniques have all been published 

extensively13. Our modelling was mainly focused on adequate integration of frequency-

dependent permittivity in the general 3D FDTD evolution equation. To simulate the 

permittivity, the matching Debye models were obtained from the Drude models for the 

gold nanorods,

illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave at normal incidence. The overall geometry 

of the nanorods inside the elementary cell followed the trapezoidal shape of the 

experimental sample. Since we used a uniform grid with a spatial resolution of 10 nm, 

the 5-nm Ti layers (Fig. 1c) were not taken into account in those simulations. The thick 

glass layer was considered infinite in the simulations with the substrate of ITO-coated 

glass (Fig. 2). The results in Fig.4 were obtained using exactly the same elementary cell, 

but without the ITO-glass substrate. Two perfectly matching layers13, which emulate 

infinite propagation of the scattered field, were arranged in front of and behind the 

nanorods. Standard periodic boundary conditions were applied to the elementary cell 

elsewhere to ensure periodicity of the entire array. The total-scattered field separation 

technique was used to obtain the scattered fields13. The field data for reflection and 

transmission coefficients were taken at selected evaluation planes in front of and behind 

the nanostructure using one-period sampling and additional Fourier filtering with 

averaging over the evaluation planes.

CG-411N from Delta Technologies with a thickness of 180 nm. In Fig. S1 the measured 

transmission and reflection of our ITO-coated glass are compared against the calculated 

values using the Drude model (S1). There is excellent agreement between the measured 

and calculated values as seen in Fig. S1.

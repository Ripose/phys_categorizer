ABSTRACT 

The question of annual stellar parallax is usually viewed as having been a “win-win 

situation” for seventeenth-century astronomers who subscribed to the Copernican view of 

universe in which the Earth orbits the Sun and the Sun is one of many suns (the fixed 

stars) scattered throughout space.  Detecting parallax would be solid evidence for the 

Earth’s motion, but failure to detect parallax could be explained by the stars lying at great 

distances.  Recent work pertaining to Galileo’s observations of double stars illustrates 

Galileo’s skill as an observer.  It also indicates that, given the knowledge of optics of the 

time, Galileo could expect his measurements to be accurate enough that they would have 

revealed stellar parallax had it existed.  Thus parallax was not a “win-win situation” after 

all.  It could be solid evidence against the Earth’s motion, evidence which fortunately did 

not dissuade Galileo from the Copernican view.

I. INTRODUCTION 

For the greater part of the five centuries that have elapsed since Copernicus proposed a 

heliocentric model of the universe in his De Revolutionibus Orbium Coellestium, 

astronomers who subscribed to Copernicus’s view had to deal with the issue of annual 

stellar parallax.  Until stellar parallax was actually observed roughly two centuries ago, 

heliocentrists had to argue that, while they believed the universe was populated with stars 

whose distances from Earth’s Sun varied and therefore stellar parallax should exist, lack 

of observable parallax did not disprove the heliocentric model.  After all, if the stars are 

sufficiently distant the stellar parallax would exist but simply be too small to measure.  

Copernicus himself stated that the lack of any parallax meant that the stars lay at vast 

distances beyond the planets.1  Stellar parallax was a “win-win situation” for 

heliocentrists – failure to detect it proved nothing, while a successful detection would be 

powerful evidence for heliocentrism.2 

                                                 
1 Copernicus, On the Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres [De Rev.], translated by Charles Glen Wallis, 

Prometheus Books (Amherst, New York, 1995).  After describing his heliocentric model, Copernicus 
states “…now the careful observer can note why progression and retrogradation appear greater in Jupiter 
than in Saturn and smaller than in Mars…. And why these reciprocal events appear more often in Saturn 
than in Jupiter, and even less often than in Mars….  In addition, why when Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars are 
in opposition they are nearer to the Earth than at the time of their occultation and their reappearance….  
All these things proceed from the same cause, which resides in the movement of the Earth.”  In other 
words, retrograde motion and varying brightness in the planets is essentially a manifestation of Earth’s 
motion – it is a planetary parallax akin to annual stellar parallax.  Copernicus then continues “But that 
there are no such appearances among the fixed stars argues that they are at an immense height away, 
which makes the circle of annual movement or its image disappear from before our eyes since every 
visible thing has a certain distance beyond which it is no longer seen, as in optics.  For the brilliance of 
their lights shows that there is a very great distance between Saturn the highest of the planets and the 
sphere of the fixed stars.  By this mark in particular they are distinguished from the planets, as it is proper 
to have the greatest difference between the moved and the unmoved.  How exceedingly fine is the 
godlike work of the Best and Greatest Artist! [pp. 26-27]”

History of Astronomy, Vol. 36 (2005), 251-271.  Siebert writes “Thus Copernicans were actually placed 
in a win-win situation to resolve the dispute over the true world system.  They had in hand the 
‘experimentum crucis’ of the debate, and Galileo himself, as he tells us in his Dialogo, was fully aware 
of this unequal balance…. [pp. 251-252] ”

Recent work has brought to light evidence that as early as the 1610’s Galileo 

Galilei and Benedetto Castelli were actively searching for stellar parallax using the newly 

developed telescope.3,4  However, the assumption in this recent work remains that 

parallax could not disprove heliocentrism – only prove it.  This assumption may not be 

correct.  In this paper I will argue the following: 

•  Galileo’s skill as instrument-builder and observer was such that 

Galileo recorded observations with arc-second accuracy.   

•  Such accuracy meant that Galileo could obtain reproducible 

measurements of stellar sizes and distances that, while today we 

know them to be erroneous, would be viewed as reliable given the 

knowledge of his time. 

•  Those measurements would mean that stellar parallax could and, 

given the knowledge of his time, did “disprove” heliocentrism. 

At the end of the paper I will discuss questions for future study relating to Galileo’s 

fortuitous decision to support heliocentrism despite what his observations told him. 

 

 

II.  GALILEO’S SKILL AND ACCURACY 

There are many reasons for believing that Galileo could make and record observations 

with arc-second accuracy.  For example, Galileo’s observations of Jupiter have been 

shown to be of high quality – he recorded the separations between Jupiter and its moons 

to within 0.1 Jovian radii; in his sketches he places Jupiter’s moons to an accuracy of less 

than the width of the dots he uses to mark the moons’ positions; he recorded positions of

objects as faint as Neptune.5  An interesting illustration of the accuracy of Galileo’s work 

can be seen by comparing some of his sketches of the Jovian system to a simulated 

telescopic view generated by planetarium software [Figure 1].  This accuracy is also on 

display in a sketch Galileo made on 4 February 1617 of a grouping of stars in Orion 

(including three stars in the Trapezium).6  A comparison of that sketch to modern data on 

those stars again reveals Galileo’s skill and the quality of his instruments – Galileo was 

able to produce an accurate sketch of stars that were separated by less than 15 arc-

seconds [Figure 2]. 

 

By 1612 Galileo had stated that he was able to make measurements accurate to 

within arc-seconds,7 and his statements about and measurements of stars are consistent 

with that claim.  In his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632) 

Galileo states that a first-magnitude star has a diameter of 5 arc-seconds while a sixth-

magnitude star has a diameter of one-sixth that size (50/60 arc-second or 0.83 arc-

second).8  He goes on to calculate the distance to a sixth-magnitude star based on the 

assumption that a star is equal to the Sun in actual size and that its apparent size is

linearly related:

150/60 or 2.50 arc-seconds 
100/60 or 1.67 arc-seconds 
  50/60 or 0.83 arc-seconds 

 
Today we know that the size of a star seen through a small but optically fine telescope10 

is largely a function of wave optics and does not reflect the physical size of the star.  

However, a linear relationship between magnitude, size, and distance would have been a 

defensible proposition for an observer such as Galileo who knew nothing of wave optics 

[Figure 3].  Galileo believed that a good telescope did not produce illusions – that it 

accurately showed the true sizes of stars.11 

Galileo’s recorded observations of stellar sizes agree with the values given above, 

although not perfectly.  For example, undated notes of Galileo’s show that he observed 

Sirius and measured its diameter to be 5 and 18/60 arc-seconds.12  This is consistent with 

the sizes implied in the Dialogue.  Galileo also observed the star Mizar and found it to 

consist of two component stars, the brighter of which (A) he measured to have a radius of 

3 arc-seconds, and the fainter of which (B) he measured to have a radius of 2 arc-

Fixed Stars”, Isis, Vol. 69 (March 1978), pp. 77-82.  Frankel discusses Galileo’s arguments that the 
telescope reliably revealed the true size of heavenly bodies, such as stars.  Frankel includes (p. 81) an 
argument of Galileo’s which discusses observing Sirius from dark through dawn to sunrise with both the 
eye and the telescope:  While Sirius seen with the eye diminishes in size and disappears as the sky 
brightens, as seen with the telescope the star’s appearance does not change.  This shows that what is seen 
through the telescope is the pure object.  The argument can be found in Opere, Vol. 6, p. 81.

seconds.13,14  This undated observation was probably made on 15 January 1617.15  Mizar 

A is about magnitude 2 and B is about magnitude 4, so the diameters of 6 and 4 arc-

seconds that Galileo determined in 1617 differ from the sizes implied in the Dialogue 

fifteen years later, but by less than two arc-seconds.  Galileo measured the center-to-

center separation between the two stars to be 15 arc-seconds.  Galileo’s separation 

measurement is within half an arc-second of modern measurements,16 and his radius 

measurements agree closely in proportions to what would be expected for optically good 

telescopes of the sizes he used [Figure 4].  

In short, Galileo’s notes and writings indicate that he was able to make and record 

observations to a high level of accuracy.  That Galileo achieved such results with some of 

the first telescopes known to be used to study the heavens, especially when his 

contemporaries were unable to see even relatively easy celestial sights with their 

telescopes, is a testament to his talent and work ethic.17 

III. STELLAR PARALLAX – NOT A “WIN-WIN” SITUATION 

Unless the previously mentioned results were all flukes, and his claim of arc-seconds 

accuracy an exaggeration, Galileo must have been able to produce similar-quality

Early Search…”, p. 259).  

17 For another testament to Galileo’s talent, and a further demonstration of his accuracy and of what he was 
able to achieve with his telescopes, the reader is advised to study Tom Pope and Jim Mosher’s web site, 
“CCD Images from a Galilean Telescope”, (www.pacifier.com/~tpope).  Pope and Mosher constructed a 
Galilean telescope and obtained afocal CCD images through it.  By comparing their CCD images with 
Galileo’s notes and sketches, they too find Galileo to be remarkably accurate in his observations.  Pope 
and Mosher’s work served as the inspiration for a large part of this paper.

observations at other times.  The quality of Galileo’s observations now comes to bear on 

the question of parallax and whether it was a “win-win situation” for heliocentrists. 

Galileo used his observation of Mizar to calculate that Mizar A, being 1/300 the 

apparent radius of the Sun, must be 300 times more distant than the Sun (300 A.U.).18  In 

doing this Galileo assumed that stars are suns.  By the same logic, Mizar B would be 450 

A.U. distant. 

Today we know these distances to be inaccurate in the extreme.  We know that 

the differing stellar radii Galileo was measuring represented nothing more than a 

combination of a wave optics diffraction pattern/Airy Disk and the limits of the human 

eye [Figures 3 and 4].  However, as mentioned earlier in this paper, he could not know 

this.  He thought he was seeing the physical bodies of stars.  For all other objects Galileo 

observed, size was inversely proportional to distance.  He used size arguments to argue, 

for example, that Mars and Venus orbited the Sun.19  An understanding of wave optics 

and Airy Disks was far in the future when Galileo was using his telescope.  There was no 

                                                 
18 Galileo, Opere, Vol. 3, part 2, p. 877. 
19 Galileo, Dialogue, “SIMP. How do you deduce that it is not the earth, but the sun, which is the center of 

the revolutions of the planets?  SALV. This is deduced from the most obvious and therefore most 
powerfully convincing observations.  The most palpable of these, which excludes the earth from the 
center and places the sun there, is that we find all the planets closer to the earth at one time and further 
from it at another.  The differences are so great that Venus, for example, is six times as distant from us at 
its farthest as at its closest, and Mars soars nearly eight times as high in the one state as in the other….  
SIMP. But what are the signs that they move around the sun?  SALV. This is reasoned out from finding 
the three outer planets – Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn – always quite close to the earth when they are in 
opposition to the sun, and very distant when they are in conjunction with it.  This approach and recession 
is of such moment that Mars when close looks sixty times as large as when it is most distant. [pg. 321-
322]”  When Galileo says sixty times he is referring to size in terms of area, which corresponds to a 
variation of just under eight times in terms of diameter or radius.  Galileo restates all this later:  “SALV. 
…if it were true that the distances of Mars from the earth varied as much from minimum to maximum as 
twice the distance from the earth to the sun, then when it is closest to us its disk would have to look sixty 
times as large as when it is most distant….[pg. 334]”  Galileo goes on to say that “…both Mars and 
Venus do show themselves variable in the assigned proportions….” but that these variations are only 
visible by means of the telescope (pg. 335).

reason for him to think that the size of a star was any less related to geometry and 

distance than was the size of Mars or Venus.   

At distances of 450 A.U. and 300 A.U., Mizar’s two components should have had 

parallax angles of 7.6 arc-minutes and 11.5 arc-minutes respectively.20  Over the course 

of a year, this would mean that the separation of the two would vary by several arc-

minutes.  Since they were separated by only 15 arc-seconds and since Galileo could 

observe with arc-seconds accuracy, the Earth’s motion should have revealed itself easily 

after a short time. 

A similar situation existed in the Trapezium.  Here the stars again have 

separations of almost 15 arc-seconds, but in this case their sizes as recorded by Galileo 

varied by a factor of 4 or 5, rather than by a factor of 1.5 as in the case of Mizar.21  This 

of course would translate into their distances varying by a factor of 4 or 5 under the 

assumptions that stars were Suns.  Even if we assume that the brightest of the Trapezium 

stars (Galileo’s star “g” in Figure 2 – a fifth magnitude star) was an order of magnitude 

more distant than Mizar A (and thus substantially more distant than even the distance of 

sixth magnitude stars that Galileo would later discuss in his Dialogue22), the difference in 

their parallax angles is such that their separation should show variations over the course 

of a year on the order of an arc-minute.23 

Of course such parallax-produced swings in the separations of Mizar and the 

Trapezium do not occur.24  Given that Galileo’s measurements and calculations were 

                                                 
20 tan-1(1/300) = 0.191o = 11.5’ = 688”.  tan-1(1/450) = 0.127o = 7.6’ = 458”. 
21 Galileo, Opere, Vol. 3, part 2, p. 880. 
22 Galileo, Dialogue, pp. 359-360. 
23 If star g [Figure 2] lies at 3000 A.U. and its fainter companion is only four times as distant (12,000 A.U.):  

tan-1(1/3000) = 0.0191o = 1.15’ = 69”.  tan-1(1/12,000) = 0.00478o = 0.29’ = 17”.   

24 Siebert argues that Galileo was aware of other close star groupings besides Mizar and the Trapezium.  

Parallax was not seen in them, either (Siebert, “The Early Search…”, pp. 258-262). 

 

8 

perfectly logical within the knowledge of his time, the lack of observable parallax would 

indicate that one of the assumptions involved in the observations and calculations was 

wrong.  Either the Earth was not moving, or the stars were not Suns at differing distances 

from Earth.25   

If the Earth is not moving, then heliocentrism is invalid.   

If the stars are not identical to the Sun, but rather vary in size so that, for example, 

Mizar A is Sun-like but Mizar B is smaller than the Sun, that could explain the lack of 

observable parallax in the two stars.  But this would require the stars to essentially lie on 

a sphere that is centered on the Sun.  If B was as much as two percent more distant than 

A Galileo could have detected parallax-induced variations in the A-B separation.26  If we 

operate on the assumption that the stars are much further away, as we did with the 

Trapezium, we find Galileo could have detected variations if stars differed by thirty 

                                                 
25 We could argue that it never occurred to Galileo to look for stellar parallax in close groupings of stars, as 
I know of no Galileo notes explicitly stating “I have been observing Mizar and the Trapezium for months 
now and there is no sign of parallax.”  However, Siebert presents a convincing case that Galileo had to be 
aware that close star groupings could reveal parallax, citing a letter from one Lodovico Ramponi to 
Galileo outlining the idea in 1611 (Siebert, “The Early Search…”, p. 254).  Ramponi’s letter can be 
found in the Opere (Vol. 11, pp. 159-162).  If we argue that Galileo never once looked for parallax in the 
close star groupings he found, then we must explain why he would have declined to do so – a tough 
proposition. 

26 Following the angle calculations used in previous notes:  If Mizar A lies at distance s from the Sun (in 
A.U.), if B lies k times further than A, and if Galileo can detect variations in the stars’ separations of 
amount ∆, then to a reasonable approximation ∆ = tan-1(1/s) - tan-1(1/(ks)), and  
k = {s[tan(tan-1(1/s)-∆]}-1.  For Mizar A, s = 300 A.U.  Galileo measured Mizar’s components to be 
separated by 15 arc-seconds.  Let us very conservatively assume that Galileo can detect variations in 
separations on the order of this value so ∆ = 15 arc-sec.  These values yield k = 1.022; Galileo could 
detect relative changes in the separation of Mizar A and B due to parallax if B was 2.2% more distant 
than A.  If we are less conservative and say that Galileo could detect changes comparable to the radii of 
the stars that he measured, so that ∆ = 3 arc-seconds, then k = 1.004.

percent in distance.27  The result in either case is that the heavens would be a great shell 

of stars centered on the Sun.28 

Another possibility was that the stars were not like the Sun at all.  If they were far 

vaster than the Sun they could lie at even vaster distances than we’ve calculated so far 

and the question of stellar parallax would again be a “win-win situation”.  If Mizar A was 

more than an order of magnitude larger than the Sun, and thus at a distance of 6,000 A.U. 

instead of 300 A.U., then the parallax might be difficult to detect.29  The heavens in this 

case would indeed be huge, but the heavens would be populated by stars that were twenty 

times the size of the Sun.  Instead of being similar to the Sun, the stars would be an 

unknown type of object.30 

IV. QUESTIONS 

 

 

Despite all this, Galileo apparently chose to stand by the view that heliocentrism was 

correct, with the stars in fact suns at varying distances from Earth.31  He even rather 

                                                 
27 Using the 3000 A.U. value for star “g” [Figure 2] and ∆ = 15 arc-sec, k = 1.279.  Using ∆ = 3 arc-sec,  

k = 1.046. 

28 Another possibility would be that stars could be of differing sizes and grouped, so that Mizar A and star 

“g” [Figure 2] lay at differing distances, but had smaller companions with them, so that close star 
groupings were not just chance line-of-sight alignments.  This idea lay well in the future. 

29 If Mizar A lay at 6000 A.U., B would lie at 9000 A.U. tan-1(1/6000) = 0.0095o = 0.57’ = 34”.   

tan-1(1/9000) = 0.0064o = .38’ = 23”.  This would be hard to detect under the ∆ = 15 arc-sec criterion 
stated in notes above.  If the ∆ = 3 arc-sec criterion is used then the stars would be all that much further 
and larger. 

30 One possibility that has been raised in discussions of this topic with colleagues has been that perhaps the 
lack of parallax could be explained if stars were suns but simply did gave off differing amounts of light.  
This possibility is not valid, however.  Galileo, not being aware of Airy Disks, etc. would have assumed 
he was seeing the full disk of a star, much as he might see the full disk of Mars or Jupiter.  Two stars of 
the same size at the same distance that gave off differing amounts of light would appear equal in radius 
but of differing surface brightness. 

31 Galileo, Dialogue.  Salviati states that the stars are suns: “See, then, how neatly the precipitous motion of 
each twenty-four hours is taken away from the universe, and how the fixed stars (which are so many 
suns) agree with our sun in enjoying perpetual rest [pg. 327].”  Salviati uses the assumption that stars are 
suns in calculating the distance to a sixth magnitude star (pg. 359).  This calculation is consistent with his 
Mizar calculations.  He later states “…I do not believe that the stars are spread over a spherical surface at 

10 

surprisingly proposed in the Dialogue that a close pairing of stars of different brightness 

could yield proof of Earth’s motion – as though such observations had never been tried.32   

Since Galileo was right in his views – the Earth does orbit the Sun and the stars 

are suns at varying distance from Earth – this apparently is a very fortuitous case of 

someone standing by a theory against contrary observational evidence.  We can imagine 

the history of science if Galileo had instead been swayed by his data into questioning his 

views and concluding that either the Earth was not moving and perhaps Tycho Brahe was 

right, or that the Sun was at the center of a universe bounded by a shell stars, or that the 

Sun was a unique body amid a vast universe of vast and alien stars.  Had Galileo put his 

forceful style of argument behind any of these propositions, it seems likely that a correct 

understanding of the nature of the universe would have been delayed by a significant 

amount of time.   

We can also imagine the history of science had Galileo not been particularly 

swayed by his lack of success in detecting stellar parallax, but still decided to publish his 

results anyway as interesting data regarding an important scientific question.  Galileo 

may not have been swayed from his views by his data, but it seems safe to say that others 

might have been swayed had they been given the chance to see it.  No doubt the 

geocentrists of Galileo’s time would have realized that stellar parallax was not a “win-

win situation” for heliocentrists after all.  They would have claimed that the data 

undermined Copernicus and probably would have hunted for more close star pairings as 

                                                                                                                                                 
equal distances from one center; I suppose their distances from us to vary so much that some are two or 
three times as remote as others [pg. 382].” 

32 Galileo, Dialogue.  “Thus if some tiny star were found by the telescope quite close to some of the larger 
ones, and if that one were therefore very remote, it might happen that some sensible alterations would 
take place among them corresponding to those of the outer planets. [pg. 382-383]” 

 

11 

further support for a geocentric view.  Again, it seems likely that a correct understanding 

of the nature of the universe would have been delayed by a significant amount of time.   

Lastly, it is not too speculative to suppose had the geocentrists known when the 

Dialogue appeared that Galileo’s double-star data had existed for over a decade, 

unpublished, while Galileo advocated in the Dialogue views that the data argued against, 

they would not have approved.  Whatever insights motivated Galileo to personally 

remain convinced of heliocentrism despite the data would probably not have impressed 

his opponents as much as the data.  They would have felt Galileo was withholding 

information that undermined his view of the universe. 

V.  CONCLUSION 

The quality of Galileo’s instruments and observations meant that stellar parallax was not 

a “win-win situation” for heliocentrists after all.  Careful observations combined with the 

limited understanding of optics of the time would yield results that challenged the view 

that the Earth circled the Sun, which in turn was one of many suns at scattered throughout 

the universe.  Fortunately for the progress of science, Galileo did not share all his 

observations with the world at large.  Scholars who have an interest in this topic can find 

much to explore regarding questions about the early search for stellar parallax, how that 

search supported or undermined the Copernican heliocentric model, why Galileo made 

the decisions he made about supporting heliocentrism and about which results to share 

with the world at large, and how Galileo’s parallax work would have been received by his 

opponents.

Figure 1 caption:  
Galileo’s drawings compared to output from the Stellarium open-source planetarium 
software (www.stellarium.org).  6 January 1613 shows Neptune in the lower-right corner.  
Stellarium shows Neptune as being magnitude 7.9 at the time.  The Stellarium User Guide 
states that positions of Galilean satellites are valid for 500 A.D. - 3500 A.D. but does not 
state a level of precision.  It states that the positions of Jupiter and Neptune are accurate to 
1 arc-second.  Differences exist between sketches and Stellarium due to Galileo’s errors, 

 

13 

Stellarium’s errors, and the author’s limits in estimating the moment in time a given sketch 
represents, but the comparison is remarkable nonetheless.

Figure 2 caption:  
Column A (top row) is Galileo’s sketch of five stars in Orion which Galileo labeled a, b, c, g, 
i.  The second row is a plot of the locations of stars HD 37042, HD 37041, HD 37023, HD 
37022, and HD 37020 plotted according to their ICRS 2000.0 coordinates as given by the 
SIMBAD astronomical database (http://simbad.harvard.edu/Simbad).  According to the 
SIMBAD database, none of the stars in question have large enough proper motions to 
produce substantial changes between 1617 and 2006. The third row superimposes these two, 
with Galileo’s sketch processed to show his markings as white areas circled by a black 
border, and rotated and enlarged to match the plot. Column B features the same method 
applied to a January 2001 image of the Trapezium from the European Southern 
Observatory (http://www.eso.org/outreach/gallery/vlt/images/Top20/Top20/press-rel/phot-
03a-01-normal.jpg) for the purpose of comparison, as well as of illustrating limits in the 
author’s software and skills in the area of image processing and alignment.

Figure 3 caption:  
The image of a star formed by a telescope is a diffraction pattern consisting of a central 
maximum (Airy Disk) whose angular radius is given by rA = 1.22λλλλ/D.  Here λλλλ is the 
wavelength of light (taken in this paper as 550 nm, the center of the visible spectrum) and D 
is the telescope’s aperture.  The intensity in the pattern as a function of radius is given by 
I=I0[J1(r)/r]2 where J1(r) is a Bessel function of the first kind.  In the top row we see plots of I 
vs. r along with an illustration of the diffraction pattern.  The plots of I vs. r include both a 
linear axis plot with which most readers will be most familiar, and a semi-log plot (insert) 
which will be more useful for the purposes of this paper.  While the images of all stars have 
the same Airy Disk radius (middle row, left), they do not all have the same intensities.  

 

16 

Consider a telescope system (consisting of telescope, eye, and sky conditions) which can 
detect stars of magnitude 6 but barely lacks the sensitivity to detect stars of magnitude 7.  
Thus there is an intensity limit below which the eye detects nothing, and above which the 
eye detects starlight.  This limit is shown as a horizontal line on the semi-log plot in the 
middle row (right), just above the intensity curve for a seventh magnitude star.  The result 
of this limit is that the stars will have differing sized apparent radii, shown by the diamond-
shaped markers on the plot where the stars’ intensities drop below the limit.  Thus a fifth 
magnitude star will have an apparent radius of about 0.65 rA, while a first magnitude star 
will have an apparent radius of 0.93 rA and a negative-first magnitude star will have an 
apparent radius nearly equal to the Airy Disk radius.  A plot of apparent radius vs. 
magnitude is shown in the bottom row.  Note that for middling magnitude stars, the 
relationship would appear essentially linear to observers.  This translates into a linear 
relationship between magnitude and distance if we assume that all stars are roughly equal 
in actual size and that their apparent size is a function of distance and geometry as is true 
for every other object.  This is especially true considering that truly bright stars that break 
from the line on the graph are comparably few in number and that faint stars that break 
from the line are a challenge to observe and measure.  For a larger telescope on a clear 
night both the limiting magnitude and rA would be smaller and the “brighter is bigger” 
linear relationship would be less obvious.  For a smaller telescope the relationship would be 
more pronounced.  But for a sufficiently skilled observer using a single telescope or similar 
telescopes, the idea that a sixth magnitude star is six times as distant as a first magnitude 
star was not just a convenient assumption but a defensible deduction.

Figure 4 caption:  
The magnitudes of Mizar A and B (HD 116656 and HD 116657) according to the SIMBAD 
database are 2.27 and 3.95 respectively.  Their relative motions are not significant enough to 
greatly alter their separation between 1617 and 2006.  Their separation according to 
Hipparcos data from the Millennium star atlas (http://www.rssd.esa.int/Hipparcos/msa-
tab7.html) is 14.4 arc-seconds.  Galileo observed A to have a radius of 3 arc-seconds and B 
to have a radius of 2 arc-seconds, with a center-to-center separation of 15 arc-seconds.  
Plotting the intensity curves for these two stars based on a 26 mm telescope (top left) and 
setting a detection level such that B will have a 2 arc-second radius yields an expected 
radius for A of 3.65 arc-seconds (shown by the diamond-shaped markers).  At top right we 
see a diagram of Mizar as Galileo measured it and as we would expect it to appear today via 
calculations for a 26 mm telescope system whose limit of detection gives B a 2 arc-second 
radius.  In the bottom row we see the same calculations done for a 38 mm telescope.  
Regardless of the telescope size used, the agreement between what Galileo observed and the 
results of the calculations is remarkable.

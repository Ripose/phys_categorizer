ABSTRACT

We describe a new method of calculating the renormalised energy of a field

obeying the Maxwell and Dirac equations. The method does not involve

evaluating integrals but relies instead on summing a geometric series. We

show that the new solution is equivalent to summing over the levels in the

gravitational hierarchies explored previously by Bell and Diaz [2004a]. We

augment our gravitational model by the introduction of a shell composed of

a smooth mixture of negative and positive energy. This separates the charge

from the mass of a body and leads to a more general hierarchy. Summing

over the levels in this then produces the renormalisation series found above

for the electromagnetic field, as well as the renormalisation series required

by gravity.

PRELIMINARIES

1.1 Note on Nomenclature

Matrices consisting of more than one row or column, quaternions and

maps are given boldface type.  T signifies transposition. † signifies Hermitian

conjugation. ‡ signifies quaternion conjugation [Altmann 1986]. A lowercase

Latin subscript stands for 1, 2 or 3 and indicates the space axes. A

lowercase Greek subscript stands for 0, 1, 2, or 3 and indicates the space-

time axes. i is the square root of

.1-

the potential in equations (1.2.C). Alternatively, we may revert to the more

usual expressions, as we did for the potential, and multiply the temporal

1.3 Bohr’s Equations

The Maxwell and Dirac equations describe the behaviour of two types

of radiation and associated particles [Bell and Diaz 2004b]. The first type,

called terrestrial, travels at the speed of light, while the second, called

celestial, travels infinitely fast between bodies at rest with respect to each

other. The difference between the two lies in the way the equations

transform between frames. In the terrestrial case, Lorentz transformations

apply. In the celestial, rotations between the temporal and spatial co-

ordinates using a real angle are appropriate.

The two-body interaction in which the Dirac equation describes the

behaviour of a point body feeling an inverse distance potential from a point

source, in the rest frame of the source, can be solved in the manner Dirac

prescribed [Dirac 1958]. The scalar potential is the same in the terrestrial

and celestial case [Bell and Diaz 2004b], nor is there is no overt mention of

any change of frame here. We therefore expect the same solution in the

celestial case, since the same trim Maxwell and Dirac equations can be

used. This means that our new derivation of Bohr’s equations from the

Maxwell and Dirac equations [Bell et al. 2004a&b] must be re-interpreted

in the celestial case, because Bohr’s equations were derived in a space  M

using the Lorentz transformations appropriate for the terrestrial case. M

arose when the Maxwell and Dirac equations were transformed from the

space we called L, where Dirac’s solution held [Bell et al. 2004a&b], [Bell

2004], into a new form in a new space, M. For the celestial case the factors

in the Lorentz transformation become [Bell and Diaz 2004b],

integer, with the proviso that charges with the opposite sign attract for the

terrestrial version and charges with the same sign attract for the celestial

version. We remark further on this below in section 2.2. Bohr’s second

equation depends entirely on the frame in which the quantisation is

performed and on what. If we wish to reproduce the terrestrial version

celestially,

we will need to assume that we are quantising a circular motion of the

system as a whole round the particle in the rest frame of the particle. This

follows because the energy of the system as a whole changes from the

terrestrial version, 

m -

to the celestial version,

m

from the

relations (1.3.A). The spatial component of the latter is obtained by

multiplying by the velocity, v, from the same relations. We then insist that

the spatial part of the wave function of the system as a whole is single-

valued, which produces Bohr’s second equation in the same way as it did in

the terrestrial case [Bell et al. 2004a&b]. We may re-interpret Bohr’s first

equation in the same way as a circular motion of the system as a whole in

the rest frame of the particle. We may find the unrenormalised velocity, v,

2. THE RENORMALISED SOLUTION

2.1 Derivation for a Constant Potential

We drop explicit mention of the charges in this section. We enhance

the unrenormalised solution of Bohr’s equations, (1.3.B), to provide a

solution to all orders, initially by following Greiner and Reinhardt’s [1996]

derivation. Let the free Dirac equation in L be given by,

This is the same as the unrenormalised solution obtained by solving the

switch the potential off and consider the development of

However, we gain nothing from propagating the scattered wave here, since

we do not have to allow the potential to vary with location and time and our

method is not sensitive to differences in the phase of the propagated wave

function. Nor do we want to switch the potential off for this bound state. So

we will pick the instant

adjusted potential.

2.2 An Arbitrary Field

We return to our demonstration that the particle version of QED

theory may be inferred from the information that the two-body interaction

obeys Bohr’s equations [Bell et al. 2004a&b]. We did this by showing that

we could calculate a wave function for a particle feeling the effects of an

arbitrary distribution of charge independently of the boundary conditions.

We split the charge into infinitesimal discs or spheres and calculated the

potential on the boundary or surface. Then we found the wave function of a

particle feeling that potential and obeying the Bohr equations. This wave

function satisfies the Dirac equation and we arranged for the surfaces of the

discs or spheres to be linked so that they covered the space L, providing, on

addition of the boundary conditions, a solution of the Dirac equation over L.

We can renormalise by adjusting the potential arising from each disc or

sphere using equation (2.1.T). This means that we must knowhand hence .v

We discover these from the renormalised solution to the Bohr equations.

Bohr’s first equation is derived from an inverse distance potential

[Bell et al. 2004a&b] and to reflect the renormalised solution this should

become the adjusted potential. We derived Bohr’s first equation using

equation (1.2.K) and de Broglie’s relations to give us the kinetic energy,

,h

of the free electron and energy of the system as a whole,

.n In the terrestrial

find a third possibility,

 We will comment on this after we have

finished describing the renormalised solution in an arbitrary field.

We may now calculate the adjusted potential using equation (2.1.T) or

equation (2.2.B). If this is used for the Dirac equation the result will be

accurate to all orders, given our discussion in section 2.1. The correction

could be summed up by deriving a new version of Maxwell’s equations

which delivered the adjusted potential but it would also be necessary to

specify which particle is to be influenced, because its mass, charge and

level of excitation,

,qn would necessarily appear. This new version of

Maxwell’s equations would therefore be a radical departure that we do not

undertake.

Finally, it may be that some of the interactions we classify under

different names, for example, quantum flavourdynamics or quantum

chromodynamics, might be reachable using the alternative values for the

fine structure constant given in equations (2.2.E) and the Dirac equation for

new particles. We say this more particularly because of the triune nature of

the electric charge in the trim Dirac equation [Bell and Diaz 2004b].

and the hierarchies of thin shells found for gravity in the terrestrial case

[Bell and Diaz 2004a], [Bell 2004]. These hierarchies also apply in the

celestial case, for two reasons. First, Bohr’s equations, which are the same

in both cases, specify the interaction at each level. Next, we define the

Dirac energy. This is the unrenormalised energy found by the usual energy

operator operating on a wave function obeying Dirac’s equation with a

potential obeying Maxwell’s equations. Then, second, the rules for going

from one level of a hierarchy to the next are the same, provided we suppose

that, for both in the same way, the Dirac energy at one level is the origin of

the charge on the source for the interaction at one level higher.

We obtained such a hierarchy for the unishell, a constant series that

appears whenever we consider a body feeling the effect of gravity [Bell and

Diaz 2004a].

from table 2 and equations (2.2.A) and (3.1.A). Renormalisation is now

defined in terms of a sum over the hierarchy, which we will refine in

section 3.4.

We will need to enhance the description of gravitational hierarchies

we gave previously [Bell and Diaz 2004a] to allow the factor 2 which

appeared ubiquitously there, for example in table 1, to take on other values,

as happens in the renormalisation series in equation (3.1.A) applied to

electromagnetism. We derived a more general hierarchy than the unishell,

which we called the copyshell, and it is this description that we will

generalise still further. The copyshell represents the combined effect of the

unishell and some other shell, the copy shell. The latter could represent the

earth, the solar system or some other gravitational body. The copyshell

hierarchy is

3.2  Matter and Charge

We derived the unishell and copyshell hierarchies by showing that the

curvature of space-time required by general relativity could also be

represented by motion in a flat space-time [Bell 2004], [Bell and Diaz

2004a]. A closed circular path in the curved space-time was compared with

circular motion in the flat space-time. These paths could be made arbitrarily

small, at which point the similarity between the former and the path used

for the derivation of the Riemann tensor is apparent [Martin 1995]. They

differ only in the assumption of how many limits there are. There is only

one if space is deemed continuous, usually reached by using the calculus,

while there may be more, if a space has an hierarchical character. The

Sarah Bell

19

20th June 2004

Renormalisation and hierarchies

difference can be illustrated with the difference between the a system at the

critical point and the system away from criticality [Bell 1992]. In the first

case, if we weight each tile or pixel equally, the size and shape of the clique

do not matter, while in the second they affect the parameters which may be

derived from a Markov model. If however, the cliques are given a discrete

fractal pattern, rather than an identical weight, then there is no longer a

single limiting state of criticality but many [Bell 1992]. The difference

between the system on or off criticality becomes a difference of criticalities.

In our current case, the continuous space of general relativity becomes a set

of discrete steps away from a source at each of the Bohr radii for each level

of the hierarchies [Bell and Diaz 2004a]. These radii were taken to be the

same for both the flat and curved space and the interval in the former was

set equal to the temporal co-ordinate in the latter. The angle turned in the

former,

,ˆq was related to the angle turned in the latter,

wherecis an adjustable parameter, allowing us to join the motion at one

level of the hierarchy smoothly onto the motion at the level below or above.

We may introducecby inserting a permittivity into the metric.

For electromagnetism, if our units are such that the permeability is

one, which we shall assume, we know that [Bleaney and Bleaney 1965],

2 =c

e

(3.2.B)

wheree is the permittivity and c is the velocity of an electromagnetic wave.

The same function is performed by the gravitational constant,

,G for gravity.

Sarah Bell

20

20th June 2004

Renormalisation and hierarchies

It would appear that we have no license to introduce a different permittivity

into either electromagnetism or gravity, because c is the value found

experimentally for the velocity of both light and gravitational waves.

However, the change is temporary because we shall absorb this factor into

the mass of the orbiting particle, once we have separated this from its

charge, as we shall below. In practice, adding

1„e to our previous account

[Bell and Diaz 2004a] can be achieved by replacing the mass of the

source,

To achieve the factor we wanted in equation (3.2.A),

the permittivity must become

We also need to introduce a more general parameter into our previous

description of the self-gravitating thin spherical shell [Bell and Diaz

2004a], which we used to generate and calculate parameters for the

copyshell. Here we supposed for the strength of the attraction,

where

~
2 was the mass of the shell, r its radius and we have added .e The
sM

factor of a half was introduced because each infinitesimal portion attracts

all the other portions except itself. We would like to generalise this by using

a free parameter,

We may do this by supposing that the shell is composed of an even mixture

of positive and negative mass in the ratio

:1 k The positive mass will

.

contribute a term proportional to 21 as before. Since two negative masses

leave the sign of F unchanged in equation (3.2.D), these will also attract,

contributing

,22k

 while a positive and negative mass will repel each other,

contributing .k  We calculate the average attraction per unit squared of the

material,

This resolves to give the factor a half we found previously [Bell and Diaz

Equations (3.2.L) quantise the hierarchy at level zero. This results in Bohr’s

equations for electromagnetism for that level, provided we set,

specialise to an hierarchy of the same form as the unishell, rather than the

copyshell, by setting

but in that case table 4 immediately below could

not be framed in the same way as some terms do not remain finite. This

occurs when we include level two, where the velocity would equal the

speed of light. We discuss other methods of avoiding the difficulty below.

The restriction picks the levels where the observer sees the temporal co-

ordinates lie in the same direction, that is, we have particles rather than

tachyons. Here we have found the renormalisation series for both

electromagnetism and gravity. For the former we set

[Bell et al. 2004a], [Bell and Diaz 2004a], that an imaginary value for the
,~a corresponded to charge conjugation. Converting from an

velocity,

attractive to a repulsive interaction also corresponds to a shift from the

terrestrial to the celestial case or vice versa because the sign of the potential

energy changes. This in its turn corresponds to the exchange of a

Minkowski space-time to one with a Euclidean signature [Bell and Diaz

2004b] or vice versa. Charge conjugation also, in addition, corresponds to a

shift from an electromagnetic interaction to a gravitational one or vice versa

because like charges repel in the first and attract in the second, but here we

do not usually see this as a change in signature of the space.

The tables all hold with the radius, r, and level of excitation,

,qn held

constant. If we allow the radius to vary we may adjust the mass of the

particle as we wish and still keep Bohr’s equations, (1.3.B) and (1.3.C),
valid and gh for any particular level constant. Changing qn will affecta~ and a

table with the new value is required but

gh does not alter if the level does

not. This is because of our assumption that j in the last of equations (3.2.L)

changes conformably [Bell and Diaz 2004a].

 Planck’s constant, if

we are quantising at level zero of the electroshell and describing

4. DISCUSSION

Four interrelated threads have run through this paper. We have

discussed in close conjunction, gravity, electromagnetism and their

terrestrial and celestial variants. Really, we have done no more than show

that many interactions have the same pattern. In this, the presence of the

other in some shape or form has caused a mutual rotation. The interesting

cases occur when more than one such rotation is involved. We suggest that

this provides the impetus to form the hierarchical patterns we have just

discussed. It is always necessary to choose a viewpoint, where the observer

stands, and this is not simply a point in a space, curved or otherwise, but a

level within a hierarchy. It is possible to move from viewpoint to another,

and we discussed how this might be achieved. Ways of doing so in flat

space are well known. For example, the observer might shift left or right,

forward or backward or up or down in the familiar space of a room. It is

equally possible to calculate how to do this in a hierarchy and when this is

done some unfamiliar interaction may look like a familiar one.

Electromagnetism, which is our best known interaction, can appear just like

the unishell and with quantifiable differences like the gravitation of any

body. Both may also have as adjuncts a field that travels infinitely fast,

whatever the velocity of light.

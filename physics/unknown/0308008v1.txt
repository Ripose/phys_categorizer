Abstract 

We study the second harmonic generation (SHG) in a suspension of small spherical particles 

confined  within  a  slab,  assuming  undepleted  pump  and  applying  (i)  single  scattering 

approximation  and  (ii)  diffusion  approximation.  In  the  case  (i),  the  angular  diagram,  the 

differential  and  total  crossections  of  the  SHG  process,  as  well  as  the  average  cosine  of  SH 

scattering angle are calculated. In the case (ii), the average SH intensity is found to show no 

explicit  dependence  on  the  linear  scattering  properties  of  the  suspension.  The  average 

intensity of SH wave scales as I0L/Λ2 in both cases (i) and (ii), where I0 is the intensity of the 

incident  wave,  L  is  the  slab  thickness,  and  Λ2  is  an  intensity-dependent  “SH  scattering” 

length.

1. Introduction 

 

Nonlinear optics of disordered media is a rapidly developing branch of modern optics [1,2]. 

The interplay of disorder and nonlinearity can lead to qualitatively different results depending 

on their relative strength. A relatively well studied case is that of laser beam propagation in a 

nonlinear  medium  with  an extremely  weak  disorder (e.g.,  turbulent  atmosphere),  where  the 
transport mean free path l* due to scattering is much larger that the characteristic length lNL of 
nonlinear  interaction:  l*  >>  lNL  (see  Ref.  2  for  a  review).  In  this  case,  the  nonlinear 

phenomena develop before the scattering destroys the initial beam and thus can be studied in 

the framework of paraxial (or parabolic) approximation, providing an adequate description of 
light  propagation  at  short  distances  z  from  the  source  of  radiation  (z  <<  l*  but  z  >  lNL). 

Paraxial  approximation  consists  in  assuming  the  variation  of  the  amplitude

  of  the  beam  along  the  direction  z  of  beam 

propagation  to  occur  only  over  distances  much  larger  than  the  optical  wavelength,  and 

neglecting the second-order derivative 

 in the wave equation (see, e.g. Ref. 3, p. 91).

This approximation  is  justifiable  insofar as the  wave 

 is propagating primarily along 

trE rr
),(

the  z  axis  (which  is  true  for  z  <<  l*  ).  In  this  regime,  propagation  of  light  is  governed  by 

nonlinear effects, while scattering can be taken into account as a small perturbation. Despite a 

considerable simplification of the problem due to the replacement of the full nonlinear wave 

equation  by  a  paraxial  one,  this  type  of  problems  is  still  under  active  study  (e.g.,  in 

connection with the filamentation of powerful laser pulses in the atmosphere [4,5]). 

From  the  theoretical  standpoint,  a  much  more  complicated  problem  is  that  of  light 
propagation  in  strongly  disordered  nonlinear  media,  where  l*  <<  lNL  and  z  >  l*.  Paraxial 

approximation does not apply in this case since the initial laser beam is completely destroyed 

by  scattering well before the  nonlinear phenomena start to play a role. One then deals with 

nonlinear  interaction  of  diffuse  waves.  This  problem  has  been  studied  in  nonlinear  media 

with  cubic  nonlinearity  (Kerr  effect)  and  proved  to  be  a  nontrivial  one  [6,7].  On  the  other 

hand, the lowest-order nonlinear effects – those quadratic in the wave field – have also been 
considered  in  the  limit  l*  <<  lNL  [8].  Recent  theoretical  [9,10]  and  experimental  [11]  work 

suggests  that  even  the  simplest  realization  of  a  nonlinear  disordered  medium,  a  dilute 

suspension of spherical particles, exhibits a rather unexpected and nontrivial behavior: second 

harmonic  (SH)  is  generated  by  a  single  spherical  particle  despite  its  central  symmetry  and 

seemingly  prohibited  second-order  nonlinear  effects,  and  a  measurable  SH  signal  can  be

obtained  from  a dilute suspension  of  such  particles  in  a  single  scattering  regime  [11].  Note 

that  although  SHG  in  1D  disordered  systems  of  spheres  has  been  studied  theoretically  in 

Refs.  12,  the  results  of  that  study  cannot  be  applied  to  describe  SHG  in  3D  samples  since 

disorder is known to have qualitatively different impacts on wave propagation in systems of 

different dimensionalities (for example, there is no diffusive regime in 1D) [13]. 

In  the  present  paper,  we  provide  a  theoretical  description  of  second  harmonic 

generation  (SHG)  in  a  suspension  of  small  spherical  particles,  restricting  ourselves  to  the 

following limiting cases: (i) dilute suspension (sample size L << than the scattering length l 
≤   l*  )  and  (ii)  concentrated  suspension  (L  >>  l*  ).  In  the  former  case,  we  apply  a  single 

scattering  approximation,  while  in  the  latter  case  a  diffusion  approximation  for  both  the 

fundamental and SH fields seems to be adequate. While the results obtained for the case (i) 

are in qualitative agreement with experimental data of Ref. 11 (quantitative agreement is not 

expected since the experiments of Ref. 11 were performed with particles of the order or larger 

than  optical  wavelength),  new  theoretical  predictions  are  made  for  the  case  (ii),  calling  for 

new experiments. 

2. SHG by an isolated spherical particle and a dilute suspension of particles 

We  start  with  a  brief  derivation  of  the  main  equations  describing  SHG  by  a  small  isolated 

spherical particle of radius

λ<<R

 (λ is the wavelength of the incident wave) surrounded by 

the  free  space  (see  Fig.  1).  Free  and  bounded  electric  charges  of  the  particle  (total  charge 

remaining zero) redistribute in space under the influence of electric field of the incident wave

,  the  multipole  (dipole,  quadrupole,  etc.)  moments  of  this  new  charge

distribution  being  nonzero  [9,10].  These  multipole  moments  oscillate  in  time  due  to  the 

oscillations  of  the  incident  electric  field  and  hence  the  particle  re-radiates  electromagnetic 

waves.  We  will  be  interested  in  the  re-radiation  at  the  fundamental  frequency ω  (“linear” 

scattered wave) and doubled frequency 2ω (SHG or “SH scattering” for brevity). While the 

linear  scattering  process  is  well  described  by  the  standard  scattering  theory  [14],  the  SH 

scattering requires special attention. Because of the central symmetry of the particle, the SH 

dipole  moment  of  the  particle 

exp(

)

  has  no  “local”  contribution  proportional  to

Note  that  the  first  term  in  the  curved  brackets  of  Eq.  (10)  corresponds  to  SHG  due  to  the 

nonlocal  dipole  radiation  of  the  sphere,  the  second  term  is  due  to  the  local  quadrupole 

radiation,  while  the  third  and  the  last  term  is  a  combined  term  originating  from  the 

interference of dipole and quadrupole radiation. 

The main results of the above analysis — Eqs. (6) and (10) — have been previously 

derived in Refs. 9 and 10. We now analyze them in more detail. Choosing the z axis parallel

1χ = 2χ  in Fig. 2. Note that F3 < 0 in 

the backward hemisphere (for π / 2 < θ < π) and Fig. 2(c) shows the absolute value of F3. It 

follows  from  Eq. (11)  that  if

linear  Rayleigh  scattering,  which  is  known  to  scale  as

  [14].  This  difference  is 

qualitatively  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  linear  scattered  wave  originates  from the  dipole 

radiation  with  the  dipole  moment 

∝ ,  while  in  the  case  of  SH  scattering  an  equivalent, 

r

local  dipole  contribution  is  prohibited  by  symmetry  and  the  radiated  SH field  is  due  to the 

second-order contribution to the dipole moment 

 [first term in Eq. (16)] and the

quadrupole  moment  [second  term  in  Eq.  (16)].  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  third, 

interference  term  in  the  angular  brackets  of  Eq.  (15)  for  the  differential  SH  scattering 

crossection  does  not  contribute  to  the  total  crossection  (16).  Hence,  the  role  interference 

between  dipole  and  quadrupole  radiations  amounts  to  redistribute  the  SH  energy  between 

different  directions  but  not  to  modify  the  total  radiated  energy.  In  the  case  of  complex

and 

Re χχ , respectively. Obviously, this does not change the angular dependence of the 

three terms contributing to the angular diagram of SHG but modifies their relative weights. 

While  Eq.  (16)  describes  the  total  power  of  SHG  by  a  small  spherical  particle,  the 

anisotropy of SHG can be characterized by the average cosine of SH scattering angle:

noting  that  while  the  interference  term  in  Eq.  (15)  for  the  differential  crossection  does  not 

contribute to the total crossection of SH scattering, Eq. (16), (as we have noted above), it is 

this and only this term that leads to the anisotropy of SH scattering, since the pure dipole and 

quadrupole terms are symmetric with respect to a mirror transformation

Taking into account that the SH signal  generated by a single spherical particle  is, in 

general,  small  (partly  because 

1χ   and 

2χ   are  small,  and  partly  because

), its experimental observation can be accomplished for an ensemble (suspension) 

of many particles only. We therefore consider a slab of surface area A, perpendicular to the z 

axis  and  located  in  between  the  planes  z  =  0  and  z  =  L,  filled  with  a  dilute  suspension  of 

identical spherical particles (particle number density n). We assume that n is small enough for 

the condition L << l, l2 to be fulfilled. Here l = 1/nσ and l2 = 1/nσ2 are the linear scattering 

lengths and σ and σ2 are the linear scattering crossections for the fundamental wave and the 

second harmonic, respectively. The SH scattering of an incident plane wave in the suspension 

can be then treated in the single scattering approximation. In addition, we assume that only a 

small  amount  of  energy  of  the  incident  wave  is  transferred  to  the  SH  wave  and  that  the 

intensity  of  the  fundamental  wave  always  remains  much  larger  that  the  intensity  of  the  SH 

wave.  We  can  then  neglect  the  decrease  of  the  intensity  of  the  fundamental  wave  as  it 

propagates  through  the  suspension  (the  so-called  undepleted-pump  approximation)  and 

assume  than  all  particles  in  the  suspension  experience  the  incidence  of  the  same  plane, 

linearly  polarized  wave

It is worthwhile to note that 

I ∝2

L

. The angular diagrams of SH scattering (see Fig. 2) as 

well as the average cosine of the scattering angle (Fig. 3) coincide with those obtained for an 

isolated particle [see Eqs. (11), (17)]. A characteristic dip in the forward direction seen in the 

diagram of Fig. 2(d) is in a good agreement with the recent experimental measurements [11]. 

A  quantitative  comparison  of  the  theory  and  experiment  is  complicated by  the  fact that  the 

size of colloidal particles used in Ref. 11 was of the order or even larger than the wavelength 

λ. Quantitative description of this case requires more sophisticated theoretical treatment and 

is not a subject of the present paper. 

To  conclude this  section,  we comment  on  the  issue of phase  matching  known to be 

very important in the context of optical harmonic generation (see, e.g., Ref. 3, pp. 58 and 65). 

In the  above analysis  of  SHG  in  a  dilute  suspension  of  small  particles,  we  assume  that  SH 

waves generated by  individual particles add incoherently at the measurement point (leading 

to linear scaling of SH intensity with particle number). This assumption is justified as long as 

(a)  SH  wave  generated  by  a  given  particle  acquires  large  random  phase  shift,  uncorrelated 

with  phase  shifts  of  SH  waves  generated  by  other  particles,  during  its  propagation  to  the 

measurement point, and (b) phase difference between SH waves generated by any two (even 

neighboring) particles is typically >> 2π. Both conditions (a) and (b) should be satisfied for a 

dilute suspension where (a) particle positions are random and completely uncorrelated and (b) 

typical inter-particle distance d much exceeds the optical wavelength λ. In the experiments of 

9

Ref. 11, for example, d ~ 10 µm which is at least an order of magnitude larger than λ. This 

illustrates  the  relevance  of  our  analysis  to  real  experimental  situations.  However,  if  the 

particle concentration is increased and d approaches λ, or if some order is introduced in the 

spatial distribution of particles in suspension, our results will not be valid any longer and one 

has to take into account the (partially) coherent addition of SH waves generated by different 

particles (“collective” SH scattering). Finally, relation between dielectric constants ε(ω) and 

ε(2ω)  inside  the  particle  (phase  matching  inside  the  particle)  can  also  play  some  role  but 

enters our results only via parameters 

1χ  and 

2χ  (which are sensitive to ε(ω) and ε(2ω) [10]) 

without any influence on the qualitative features of SHG discussed above. 

3. SHG by a concentrated suspension of spherical particles 

In order to enhance the SH signal, one could try to increase the density n of particles in the 

suspension. As n increases, the scattering lengths l, l2 decrease, the condition L << l, l2 breaks 

down,  and  the  single  scattering  approximation  adopted  in  the  previous  section  becomes 

invalid [15]. While the intermediate regime L ~ l, l2 is generally hard to describe even in the 

case  of  pure  linear  scattering  [14,15],  both  incident  and  SH  wave  can  be  treated  in  the 
diffusion approximation [15] in the  limit L >> l*, l2
* >> 1. Physically, 

*, if kl* >> 1 and k2l2

this  means  that  the  incident  wave  at  frequency  ω  experiences  multiple  scattering  events 

before  leaving  the  sample,  SH  being  generated  at  each  scattering  event.  Similarly,  the  SH 

waves  are  generated  all  over  the  sample  and  experience  multiple  elastic  scattering  before 

leaving the sample. Again, as in the previous section, we assume low SH intensity and work 

in the undepleted-pump approximation. The ensemble- and angle-averaged intensity U of the 

fundamental wave (proportional to its energy density) then obeys a diffusion equation [15]

be understood as an approximate result because the diffusion approximation is not expected 

to hold near the surface of  scattering medium and source of light. For simplicity, we  apply 

Eq. (22) for all z in what follows. This does not have any considerable impact on our results 
as long as L >> l*. 

Nonlinear  interaction  of  diffusely  scattered  fundamental  wave  with  particles  in 

suspension  leads  to  generation of  SH  waves  which,  in  their  turn, are  diffusely  scattered  by 

other  particles.  Since  we  assume

scattering  events  before  leaving  the  sample  and  hence  its  ensemble-  and  angle-averaged 

intensity  U2(z)  (proportional  to  the  density  of  optical energy  associated  with  the  SH  wave) 

can be described in the diffusion approximation. This amounts to write a diffusion equation 

for U2(z) with a source term

*/3 is the diffusion constant of the SH wave, 

2Σ  is given by Eq. (16), and β is 

a numerical factor of order unity, describing the conversion of the ballistic SH radiation to the 

diffuse one at small distances from the particle. The latter conversion is a weak point of the 

diffusion approximation. Although it can be treated almost exactly for a plane wave incident 

on  a  slab,  such  a  treatment  appears  to  be  rather  complicated  (if  possible  at  all)  in  the 

considered  case.  Fortunately, the  exact  value  of β  can  only  affect  the  absolute  value  of  SH 

intensity by a numerical factor of order unity. In the following, we put β = 1. 

Note that all the properties of a single particle relevant to generation of SH radiation 

(including parameters 

1χ  and 

2χ ) enter Eq. (23) via a single parameter Σ2 given by Eq. (16). 

The  anisotropy  of  SH  radiation,  described  by  the  average  cosine  of  SH  scattering  angle 

θcos

  [see  Eq.  (17)],  has  no  importance  in  the  case  of  concentrated  suspension  since 

11

anyway the radiation becomes isotropic at distances of the order of l2

* due to (linear) multiple 

scattering of SH waves on the particles in suspension.

 describes the 

evolution  of  SH  intensity  with  the  depth  z.  While  f(ξ)  decreases  linearly  with  z  due  to 

scattering,  f2(ξ)  shows  a  nonmonotonic  behavior  (see  Fig.  4).  The  energy  of  SH  wave  is 

concentrated at a distance about L/3 from the front surface of the slab. 

Average intensities of fundamental and SH waves at the back surface of the slab can 

be  found  by  applying  the  Fick’s  law  [16]  that  states  that  the  flux  of  a  quantity  exhibiting 

diffusion behavior [in our case, optical energy associated with fundamental or SH wave and 
proportional  to  U(z)  or  U2(z),  respectively]  is  proportional  to  the  gradient  of  its  density3. 

Because intensity is proportional to the energy flux, we get

 for transmission 

of  a  wave  through  a  disordered  but  linear  medium.  Curiously,  the  scaling 

I ∝2

  can  be 

qualitatively understood by considering SHG in a disordered medium as a two-step process: 

first, the SH is generated in a homogeneous slab of thickness L, and then the resulting wave is 

transmitted through a disordered but linear slab of the same thickness. The second important 

feature of Eq. (26) is that I2 does not depend explicitly on the linear scattering properties of 

                                                          
3 Fick’s law for diffuse light is the basic relation of the diffusion approximation and can be justified both based 
on the phenomenological radiative transfer theory [15,16] and more rigorous diagrammatic treatment of 
Maxwell equations [17]. It appears to be identical to that for particle diffusion [16].

the medium, i.e. neither on l and l2, nor on the corresponding transport mean free paths. It is 

an  interesting  theoretical  prediction  that  should  be  possible  to  verify  experimentally  by 

performing SHG measurements for suspensions of particles with similar nonlinear properties 

(same Λ2) but different  linear scattering properties (i.e. different l et l2). A rather surprising 

feature  of  Eq.  (26)  derived  in  the  diffusion  approximation,  is  that  it  coincides  (up  to  a 

numerical factor of order unity) with Eq. (19) obtained in the single scattering approximation. 

This suggests that the scaling law 

I

 can be rather general and weakly sensitive to 

particular experimental conditions. 

Finally, we comment on the conditions of validity of our approach. The undepleted-

pump approximation requires that I2 << I. On the other hand, the slab thickness L should be 
large compared to l* and l2
* for the diffusion approximation to hold. We find therefore that 

the following inequalities should be verified for the results of the present section to be valid:

(27) 

In addition to this condition, our analysis assumes that SHG on a given particle in the bulk of 

the medium occurs in the field of fundamental wave resulting from incoherent sum of many 

partial  waves  scattered  along  various  multiple-scattering  paths  in  the  medium. This  implies 
statistical  independence  of  these  paths  which  is  generally  accepted  to  be  true  for  kl*  >>  1 

[17].  The  discussion  of  phase  matching  in  the  case  of  dilute  suspension  at  the  end  of  the 

previous  section  also  applies  (with  evident  modifications)  in  the  case  of  concentrated 

suspension,  requiring  (a)  complete disorder in  particle  positions  and  (b)  large  (>> λ)  inter-

particle distance for our analysis to hold. 

 

 

 

4. Conclusion 

 

 

In the present paper we provide a theoretical description of the second harmonic generation 

(SHG)  by  a  suspension  of  small  spherical  particles  in  the  undepleted-pump approximation, 

assuming Raleigh limit (particle radius R << λ). For SHG by an isolated particle, we obtain 

explicit  expressions  for  the  angular  diagram  of  SH  scattering,  the  total power of  SH  wave, 

and the average cosine of SH scattering angle 

θcos

. Three different contributions (dipole, 

quadrupole,  and  interference  one)  to  the  differential  and  total  SH  scattering  crossections 

13

dΣ2/dΩ and Σ2, respectively, are identified and analyzed. We show that Σ2 scales as (R/λ)6 in 

contrast to the crossection 

σ R∝

( λ
/

 of linear Raleigh scattering, and that 

θcos

 can vary 

between -0.22 and 0.22 in the case of real-valued 

1χ  and 

2χ  considered in the present study. 

Based on the results obtained for an isolated particle, we consider SHG by (i) dilute and (ii) 

concentrated  suspensions  of  identical  particles,  assuming  that  the  suspension  is  confined 

within a slab of thickness L, illuminated by a plane monochromatic wave of intensity 0I . In 

the case (i), we apply the single scattering approximation, while in the case (ii) the diffusion 

approximation  is  used  for  both  the  fundamental  and  SH  waves.  Introducing  a  new  SH 

scattering  length 

=Λ
2

/(1

nIΣ

,  where 

2Σ   is  the  SH scattering  crossection  of an  isolated 

particle  and  n  is  the  particle  number  density,  we  show  that  the  average  intensity  I2  of  the 

“transmitted” SH wave exhibits the same scaling 

I

2

∝ LI
0

/ Λ

2

 in both cases (i) and (ii). In 

the case (i), this is simply due to the linear increase of the total particle number with L, but in 

the  case  (ii)  such  a  scaling  can  be  understood  as  resulting  from  a  combined  effect  of  the 

quadratic increase of SHG efficiency with L, on the one hand, and attenuation of the resulting 

signal  due  to  scattering,  on  the  other  hand.  The  angular  diagram  of  SHG  by  a  dilute 

suspension  of  small  spherical  particles  shows  the  same  qualitative  features  as  the 

experimental  data  of  Ref.  11  (in  particular,  SHG  in  the  forward  direction  is  absent).  An 

interesting  feature  of  the  result  obtained  for  a  concentrated  suspension  of  particles  in  the 

diffusion approximation  is the  independence of the SH intensity of the scattering properties 
of the  medium  for  L >>  l*,  l2
*.  Together  with  the  linear  scaling  of  I2  with  L  this  should be 

possible to verify experimentally.

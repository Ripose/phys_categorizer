For a given conﬁguration space M and Lie algebra G whose action is deﬁned on M the
space V0.0 of weakly G-invariant Lagrangians (i.e. Lagrangians whose motion equations left
hand sides are G-invariant) is studied. The problem is reformulated in terms of the double
complex of Lie algebra cochains with values in the complex of Lagrangians. Calculating
the cohomology of this complex using the method of spectral sequences we arrive at the
hierarchy in the space V0.0: The double ﬁltration {Vs.σ} (s = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, σ = 0, 1) and the
homomorphisms on every space Vs.σ are constructed. These homomorphisms take values
in the cohomologies of the algebra G and conﬁguration space M . On one hand every space
Vs,σ is the kernel of the corresponding homomorphism, on the other hand this space is
deﬁned by its physical properties.

I Introduction

The cohomology of the symmetries algebra has important consequences for proper-
ties of corresponding theory [1,2] and cohomological methods play essential role in many
problems of modern ﬁelds theory. For example their application made more clear the un-
derstanding of algebraic origin of gauge anomalies. As it was shown in [1] one can consider
axial anomalies of four-dimensional gauge theory in terms of inﬁnitesimal cocycles in a
representation of gauge group.

Another example is BRST formalism which at beginning was formulated in terms of
symplectic geometry of phase space expanded by the ghosts and antighosts, then it was
understood [3,4,5,6,7] that the language of homological algebra is more deeply related with
physical meaning of this formalism: Inclusion of ghosts and antighosts corresponds to the
construction of the chain of free modules (free resolvent) on phase space of constrained
system where the constrains cannot be resolved in a direct way. The operator corresponding
to BRST charge becomes the diﬀerential of the complex of these resolvents. Further the
investigation of local BRST cohomology was performed with use of developed homological
methods. (See [8,9,10] with citations there.)

In this paper we consider more modest problem. We study relations between Noether
identities and related phenomena for global symmetries of Lagrangians and cohomological
properties of the algebra of these symmetries.

Our considerations will be carried out for mechanics but the scheme has straightfor-

ward generalization on the case of ﬁeld theory Lagrangians.

The standard statement (Noether 1-st Theorem) is that if the Lagrangian L is invari-
ant under the action of Lie algebra G of rigid symmetries {δi} then to every symmetry δi
corresponds the charge Ni(L) which is preserved on the equations of motion [11].

If to {δi} corresponds the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds {Xi = X µ
i

transformations of conﬁguration space) then δiqµ ∼ X µ

(1.1)

is the left hand side (l.h.s.) of the equations of motion Fµ = 0 of the Lagrangian L.

The statement of Noether theorem is valid also in a case if under the actions of
transformations {δi} Lagrangian is preserved up to a full derivative of some functions
{αi(q)}

δiL = 0 → δiL = dαi, then Ni(L) → Ni(L) − αi .

(1.2)

At what extent this full derivative is essential? The redeﬁnition of L on a full derivative
L → L + df changes αi on αi + δif . The algebra of symmetries of the Lagrangian can be
considered as generalized if dαi is not equal 0 in (1.2), and it is essentially generalized if
it cannot be canceled by redeﬁnition of Lagrangian on a full derivative i.e. δiL = dαi but
the equations

have no solutions.
Using the basic properties of operators δ and d: δ2 = d2 = 0, dδ = δd (see the Section

d(αi + δif ) = 0 .

(1.3)

II) we obtain from (1.2) that

0 = δ2L = δdαi = dδαi, so (δα)ij = wij = constant,

(1.4)

where (δα)ij = Liαj − Ljαi − αkck
algebra.

ij and ck

ij are structure constants of the symmetries Lie

It is easy to see that wij is the cocycle of algebra G in constants. In a case if wij
is not coboundary one can see that the symmetries are essentially generalized. Indeed if
according to (1.3) αi = −δif + ti where ti are constants then wij in (1.4) is coboundary
in constants: wij = (δt)ij = −ck

ij tk.

Let us consider for example the algebra of space translations. This algebra has 2-
cohomology in constants which are represented by antisymmetric tensors Bik. (This alge-
bra is abelian, so δB = 0 and the equation B = δt has no solutions in constants.) To obtain
Lagrangian which possesses generalized translation symmetries corresponding to these co-
cycles, we note that for this Lagrangian αi = Aijqj. By redeﬁnition of a Lagrangian on a
full derivative one can reduce Aij to antisymmetric tensor and we come to Lagrangian
L = f ( ˙q) + qiBij ˙qj .

(1.5)

2

If f ( ˙q) = m ˙q2
it is the well-known Lagrangian of particle in constant magnetic ﬁeld.
2
In the Section V we consider an analogous statement for Galilean group: we show
that one comes to the Lagrangian of free particle as a unique Lagrangian corresponding
to Bargman cocycle of Lie algebra of Galilean group.

We see that one of the reasons of generalized symmetries appearing is the existence of
2-cohomology of corresponding Lie algebra [2,12]. Of course situation is more complicated.
For example by evident reasons for this phenomenon is responsible de Rham cohomology
of conﬁguration space. If Linv is G-invariant Lagrangian and L = Linv + Aµ(q) ˙qµ where
Aµ(q)dqµ is a closed diﬀerential 1-form which is not exact (Aµ(q)dqµ 6= df ) then in general
L is not G-invariant.
It has the same equations of motion but it diﬀers from Linv on
Aharonov-Bohm like eﬀects.

Even in the case if de Rham cohomology is trivial and the cocycle wij in (1.4) is
coboundary the symmetries of Lagrangian can be essentially generalized. The coboundary
condition wij = −ck
ij tk is necessary but not suﬃcient for (1.3) to have a solution. It is
another cohomologies of symmetries algebra which prevent a Lagrangian to be reduced to
G-invariant by redeﬁnition on a full derivative.

The purpose of our paper is to investigate systematically this phenomenon.
For the algebra G of vector ﬁelds on the conﬁguration space M and a Lagrangian
L(q, ˙q) on M we considered the following possible cases of generalized symmetries appearing

1) The action of G on the Lagrangian L produces the 2-cocycle on G:

δiL(q, ˙q) = d

dt αi(q), wij = δiαj − δj αi − ck

ij αk .

2) The action of G on the Lagrangian L produces the 2-cocycle, but it is trivial:

wij = −ck

ij tk .

3) The Lagrangian L diﬀers from invariant one on a closed form:
L = Linv + Aµ(q) ˙qµ, (∂µAν − ∂νAµ = 0)
dt (AµX µ
4) The Lagrangian L diﬀers from G-invariant one on an exact form (full derivative):

i ) and wij = 0.

hence δiL = d

L = Linv + ∂µf (q) ˙qµ = Linv + d

dt f (q), δiLinv = 0.

(1.6)

One can see that

(1.7)
We brieﬂy discuss how the generalized symmetries reveal itself in Hamiltonian me-

”4” ⇒ ”3” ⇒ ”2” ⇒ ”1”

chanics and in a quasiclassical approximation of quantum mechanics.

If the Lagrangian is G-invariant, then to the Noether charges Ni(L) in (1.1) in Hamil-

In quasiclassical approximation of quantum mechanics to these charges correspond

the operators X µ
sentation is reduced to inﬁnitesimal transformation of wave functions argument:

ıˆδiΨ = Ψ(qµ + δiqµ) − Ψ(qµ).
In the case if symmetries algebra is generalized, one can see that correspondingly to (1.2)

but on its phase too:

(1.9)

In the case if the Lagrangian does not possess the property ”2” in (1.6), i.e. the generalized
symmetries lead to non-trivial cocycle, the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian Noether charges
N ham
is the central extension of the Lie algebra G which corresponds to the cohomology

class of the cocycle wij.

(1.10)

Correspondingly in this case in (1.9) is realized an essentially projective representation

of the Lie algebra G.

In the case if the Lagrangian possesses the property ”2” in (1.6), then one can choose
αi such that (1.8) is satisﬁed and the quantum representation (1.9) of G becomes linear.
But if this Lagrangian does not possess the property ”4” in (1.6) then the action of quan-
tum transformation on the phase factor cannot be removed by redeﬁnition Ψ → eif Ψ
of the wave function corresponding to redeﬁnition of Lagrangian on a full derivative.
In this case one can say that the linear transformation (1.9) is splitted on a space-like
transformation+intrinsic spin-like transformation. Nevertheless if the Lagrangian pos-
sesses the property ”3”, i.e. it diﬀers of an invariant Lagrangian on Bohm-Aharonov like
eﬀects, then the action on phase in (1.9) can be removed locally.

We call time-independent Lagrangian L(q, ˙q) weakly G-invariant if l.h.s. of its motion
equations (1.1) is G-invariant. For example the Lagrangian L in (1.2) is weakly G-invariant.
One can show that if L is weakly G-invariant Lagrangian then

(1.11)
where ci are constants and wi correspond to closed forms: wi = wiµ(q) ˙q where diﬀer-

δiL = ci + wi,

ential 1-forms wiµ(q)dqµ are closed. (See in details later.)

If {wi} correspond to exact forms: wiµ(q)dqµ = dai(q), wiµ(q) ˙qµ = ∂µαi(q) ˙qµ =

(1.12)
then we come to (1.2). In the case if (1.12) is not obeyed the corresponding Noether

ci = 0

Ni = Xi

µ ∂L
∂ ˙qµ − αi − cit

We denote by V0.0 the space of weakly G-invariant Lagrangians on M and by V0.1 the
subspace of V0.0 for which the condition (1.12) is satisﬁed. We denote by Vs.1 (s = 1, 2, 3, 4,)
the space of Lagrangians for which the property ”s” in (1.6) is satisﬁed. According to (1.7)

V4.1 ⊆ V3.1 ⊆ V2.1 ⊆ V1.1 ⊆ V0.1 ⊆ V0.0 .

One can consider also subspaces {Vs.0} of the space V0.0

V4.0 ⊆ V3.0 ⊆ V2.0 ⊆ V1.0 ⊆ V0.0, Vs.1 ⊆ Vs.0

dαi(q)/dt and

charges

depend on time.

which correspond to {Vs.1} if we ignore the condition (1.12): The weakly G-invariant
Lagrangian L belongs to V1.0 if δiL = dαi + ci. It is easy to see that in this case δα is also
2-cocycle as in (1.4). L ∈ V2.0 if this cocycle is trivial, L ∈ V4.0 if αi = δif and L ∈ V3.0 if
it diﬀers from V4.0 on a closed form. Lagrangians in Vs.0 in general have time-dependent
Noether currents (1.13).

What can we say more about embeddings (1.14, 1.15)? Does weakly G-invariant
Lagrangian possesses generalized symmetries (1.2)? Can it be reduced to G-invariant?
Does there exist Lagrangian which belongs to the space Vs.0 and which does not belong to
the space Vs+1.0 or Vs.1? If an answer is ”no” what are the reasons of it.

To answer on these questions we establish the hierarchy in the space of weakly G-
invariant Lagrangians. This hierarchy relates the phenomena discussed above with coho-
mologies groups of the Lie algebra G and the conﬁguration space M .

The scheme of our considerations is the following. We are ﬁxing conﬁguration space
M and ﬁnite-dimensional algebra G of its transformations. Then we establish relations
between weakly G-invariant Lagrangians on M and the cohomologies of algebra G and
M . From considerations above we see that in the phenomena which we are investigating
are interplaying two diﬀerentials δ and dE.L where the diﬀerential δ corresponds to the
symmetries and dE.L is the prolongation of exterior diﬀerential which acts on Lagrangians.
(It is variational derivative, whose action leads to Euler-Lagrange equation. See in details
the Section II). These diﬀerentials as well as diﬀerentials d and δ satisfy the conditions:
δ2 = d2
E.L = dE.Lδ − δdE.L = 0. We naturally come to the diﬀerential Q = dE.L ± δ
which is strictly related with our problem. For example to condition δL = dα in (1.2)
corresponds the condition Q(L, αi) = (dE.LL, 0, w = δα). To redeﬁnition of Lagrangian on
a full derivative L → L+df corresponds the changing of the cochain (L, αi) on coboundary:
(L, αi) → (L, αi) + Qf = (L + df, αi + δif ).

It is the cohomology of the diﬀerential Q which allow us to reveal the relations between
generalized symmetries of Lagrangians and cohomologies of the conﬁguration space and
the symmetries Lie algebra. We do it in a following way. Using a technique of spectral
sequences we calculate the cohomology of Q via cohomology of dE.L by modulo δ, then
vice versa via cohomology of δ by modulo dE.L. Calculating cohomology of operator Q in
the ﬁrst way we come to the spaces Ks which are expressed in terms of cohomologies of
Lie algebra and conﬁguration space. On the other hand, calculating the same cohomology
in the second way, we come naturally to the space V0.0 of weakly G-invariant Lagrangians
and to its subspaces {Vs.σ} (1.14,1.15). Natural relations which arise between the results
of calculations in the ﬁrst and in the second way lead to the sequence of homomorphisms
between the spaces {Vs.σ} and {Ks} which deﬁne these spaces in a recurrent way via the
kernels of corresponding homomorphisms.

This construction establishes hierarchy in the space of weakly G-invariant Lagrangians
making links between the physical properties of Lagrangians and pure mathematical ob-
jects: The condition that Lagrangian belongs to some space Vs.σ and it does not belong to
the space Vs+1.σ or Vs.σ+1 in terms of this hierarchy is reformulated to the condition that
the value of the corresponding homomorphism on it, is not equal to zero. The problem of
analyzing the content of the spaces {Vs.σ} and their diﬀerences is reduced to the problem
of calculating the corresponding homomorphisms. For example in the case if the space Ks

5

is trivial, then Vs−1.σ = Vs.σ. In particular if all the spaces Ks are trivial then all weakly
invariant Lagrangians are invariant (up to a full derivative).

The plan of the paper is the following.
In the Section II we consider the complex of Lagrangians, clarify its relations with

corresponding complex of diﬀerential forms.

In the Section III we present the calculations of cohomology of the diﬀerential Q of
the double complex of cochains which are deﬁned on the Lie algebra G and take values
in the functions on M and in Lagrangians of classical mechanics. Using the results of
these calculations in the Section IV we establish hierarchy in the space of weakly invariant
Lagrangians and consider some general properties of this hierarchy. It is the main result
of the paper. In this Section from our point of view we consider also the hierarchy for
Lagrangians polynomial in velocities.

In the Section V using this hierarchy we calculate the content of the subspaces Vs.σ
in (1.14, 1.15) for some special cases of conﬁguration spaces and symmetries algebras. In
particular we perform this analysis for so(3), Poincar´e and Galilean algebras.

In the Section VI we give some motivations for the technique we used in this paper.
In Appendixes we give a brief sketch on the notion of Lie algebra cohomology and

calculation of double complexes cohomology via corresponding spectral sequences.

II The complexes of Lagrangians and Diﬀerential Forms

Let M be an n-dimensional manifold (conﬁguration space) and G be Lie algebra acting
on it. It means that it is deﬁned the homomorphism Φ from G in the Lie algebra of vector
ﬁelds on M :

G ∋ x Φ−→˜x (fundamental vector ﬁelds) :

[˜x, ˜y] = ˜[x, y] .

(2.1)

We denote this construction by [G, M ] pair.

Let Ωq(M ) be the space of diﬀerential q-forms on M . The linear spaces Ωq(M ) for
any given q can be considered as modules on G if we deﬁne the action of algebra on forms
via Lie derivatives along corresponding fundamental vector ﬁelds: h ◦ w = L˜hw. One can
consider the G-diﬀerential corresponding to this module structure and cohomologies spaces
H q(G, Ωq(M )) which are G-cohomologies with coeﬃcients in Ωq(M ). (See Appendix 1).

On the manifold M endowed with the action of Lie algebra G one can also consider
usual de Rham cohomologies H q(M ) of the diﬀerential forms complex {Ωq, d}, where d is
exterior diﬀerential. One can naturally prolongate the action of exterior diﬀerential d from
the spaces Ωq(M ) (0-cochains) on the spaces Cp(G, Ωq(M )) = Cp(G)⊗Ωq(M ) of p-cochains
on the Lie algebra G with values in Ωq, taking values of d on cochains in constants to be
zero. The diﬀerentials d and δ commute with each other: dδ = δd and one can consider
the corresponding double complex {Cp(G, Ωq(M )), d, δ}.

To include Lagrangians in a game we enlarge the complex {Ωq, d} of diﬀerential forms

to the complex {Λq(M ), dE.L} of Lagrangians, following [13].

We deﬁne the space Λq(M ) of q-Lagrangians (q ≥ 1) as the space of functions (La-

grangians) which depend on points qµ of manifold M and on derivatives
∂qµ
∂ξα1 ,...,∂ξαk of an arbitrary but ﬁnite order k of parameters (ξ1, . . . , ξq) which
∂ξα , . . . ,
take values in q-dimensional space Rq. In the case q = 0 we put Λ0(M ) = Ω0(M ) is the

∂kqµ

6

space of functions on M . We say that Lagrangian has the rank k if the highest degree
of derivatives on whose it depends is equal to k and we denote by Λq
k the subspace of Λq
which contains q-Lagrangians of the rank k. The Lagrangians of classical mechanics which
we consider in the following Sections belong to Λ1
1.

If L is the Lagrangian in Λq(M ) then to every map (q-dimensional path)
qµ(ξ1, . . . , ξq): Rq → M

(2.2)

corresponds the integral

(2.3)

This deﬁnes the natural embedding of the space Ωq(M ) of diﬀerential q-forms in Λq

w = wi1...iq (q)dqi1 ∧ . . . ∧ dqiq −→ Lw = n!wi1...iq (q) ∂qi1

1(M ):
(2.4)
The integral SLw ([q(ξ)]) is equal to the integral of diﬀerential form w over the surface
which is the image of the map (2.2). It does not depend on choice of parametrization q(ξ)
of this surface. We say that Lagrangian Lw corresponds to the diﬀerential form w and
later on we often will not diﬀer w and Lw.

∂ξ1 · . . . · ∂qiq
∂ξq .

Remark In general for an arbitrary Lagrangian the l.h.s. of (2.3) is not correctly
deﬁned on images of maps (2.2). It can be considered as functional on embedded surfaces
which does not depend on its parametrization in a case if Lagrangian L is a density, i.e.
under reparametrization q(ξ) → q(ξ( ˜ξ)), L → L · det(∂ξ/∂ ˜ξ) (see for example [14,15.]).
The Lagrangians corresponding to diﬀerential forms are the special examples of densities.

To deﬁne the complex of Lagrangians which is the generalization of de Rham complex
we consider following [13] the diﬀerential dE.L, using Euler-Lagrange equations of motion
for the functional (2.3):

dE.L: Λq → Λq+1,

(2.5)

where ˜α = (1, . . . , q, q +1), α = (1, . . . , q) and Fµ(L) are l.h.s. of Euler–Lagrange equations
of the Lagrangian L, i.e. variational derivatives of the corresponding functional (2.3):
Fµ(L) = δ

From the deﬁnition of dE.L and (2.4) it follows that: Ldw = dE.LLw. The complex
{Ωm(M ), d} of diﬀerential forms is subcomplex of the complex (2.7).

The spaces Λq(M ) of Lagrangians for any given q (and their subspaces Λq

k(M ) for any
given q and k) as well as Ωq(M ) can be naturally considered as modules on Lie algebra G
if we deﬁne the action of Lie algebra elements on Lagrangians via Lie derivative: if x ∈ G

Considering G-diﬀerential δ corresponding to this module structure we come to the

spaces H p(G, Λq

k(M )) of G-cohomologies with coeﬃcients in Λq

k(M ).

In the same way like for diﬀerential forms one can prolongate the action of dE.L
on the spaces Cp(G, Λq) of p-cochains with values in Λq and consider the double com-
plex {Cp(G, Λq), dE.L, δ} because for Lagrangians dE.L and δ commute also. The complex
{Cp(G, Ωq), d, δ} is embedded in this complex.

The cohomology of the complex (2.7) evidently is diﬀerent from de Rham cohomology,

but on the other hand
Proposition 1 ∗
1.If Lagrangian L is exact: L = dE.LL′ and it is a density (see the Remark above),

then it corresponds to an exact diﬀerential form.

2. If Lagrangian L is closed and it depends only on ﬁrst derivatives: dE.LL = 0, L ∈ Λq
1,

then it corresponds to closed diﬀerential form up to a constant

L = Lw + c, dw = 0 .

(2.9)

In the case if L in (2.9) is a density then c = 0.

The 2-nd statement immediately follows from (2.6) and the deﬁnition of the density.

The 1-st one we do not need here and we omit its proof.

We use this Proposition to consider the following subcomplex (C∗, dE.L) of the complex

(2.7), which will be of use in this paper:

(C∗, dE.L):

Λ0(M )

dE.L−→Λ1

1(M )

dE.L−→dE.LΛ1

1(M ) −→ 0

(2.10)

where as well as in (2.7) C0 = Λ0(M ) is the space of functions on M ; C1 = Λ1
1(M ) is the
space of Lagrangians L(qµ, ˙qµ) of classical mechanics deﬁned on the conﬁguration space M ,

∗ The complex (2.7) diﬀers from the standard variational complex (See for example
It was introduced by Th. Voronov in [13] for the Lagrangians on superspace.
[16].)
This complex and Proposition are useful in supermathematics where the concept of usual
diﬀerential form is ill-deﬁned [15,17].

8

C2 is the subspace of coboundaries in Λ2
of motion of some Lagrangian from Λ1
that a = dE.LL.

2. It contains elements corresponding to equations
1(M ) iﬀ there exists Lagrangian L such

1: a ∈ dE.LΛ1

From the 2-nd statement of Proposition 1 it follows that cohomology of this truncated

complex is strictly related with de Rham cohomology:

H 0(C∗, dE.L) = H 0(M ) , H 1(C∗, dE.L) = H 1(M ) + R, H 2(C∗, dE.L) = 0 .

(2.11)

For our purposes it is useful to consider also the following modiﬁcation of the complex
(2.7). We consider the spaces {Λq} where Λq = Λq/R if q ≥ 1 and Λ0 = Λ0 = Ω0(M ).
Elements of Λq (q ≥ 1) are q-Lagrangians which are deﬁned up to constants. We denote
by L the equivalence class of Lagrangian L in Λ. One can consider instead the complex
(2.7) the complex

{Λq(M ), dE.L}: Λ0(M )

dE.L−→Λ1(M )

dE.L−→Λ2(M )

dE.L−→ . . . .

(2.12)

and correspondingly the double complex {Cp(G, Λq), dE.L, δ} of p-cochains on G with values
¯λ ˙=dE.Lλ
in Λq. The diﬀerentials dE.L and δ are correctly deﬁned in a natural way: dE.L
and ¯δ¯λ = δλ where λ is equivalence class in C∗(G, Λ∗) of the cochain λ in C∗(G, Λ∗).
The diﬀerential dE.L does not diﬀer essentially from dE.L: If λ is cochain with values in
Lagrangians then it is easy to see that

dE.Lλ = 0, ⇐⇒ dE.Lλ = 0

(2.13)

To (2.10) corresponds the subcomplex

(C∗, dE.L):

Λ0(M )

dE.L−→Λ1

1(M )

dE.L−→(dE.LΛ1

1(M )) −→ 0

(2.14)

of the complex (2.12). From (2.13) it follows that for the truncated complex C∗

H 0(C∗, dE.L) = H 0(M ), H 1(C∗, dE.L) = H 1(M ), H 2(C∗, dE.L) = 0 .

(2.15)

We avoid here an appearance of non-pleasant constants like in (2.11). The diﬀerence
between the complex {Cp(G, Λq), dE.L, δ} and the complex {Cp(G, Λq), dE.L, δ} becomes
non-trivial at least on the level of 1-cochains.
It corresponds to the diﬀerence of time
independent and time dependent Noether charges. (See for e.g. the Example 1 in the
Section V.)

Finally we want to note that to every Lagrangian L on M corresponds the density
AL on the space ˆM = M × {space of parameters}. (It is so called formalism where ﬁelds
and space variables are on an equal footing [18]). To the functional (2.3) corresponds the
integral of the density over the surface in ˆM which is the graph of the map (2.2). For
example to Lagrangian L(qµ, dqµ

dt ) of classical mechanics one can correspond the density

if τ → τ ′(τ ), then AL →

(2.16)

To a path qµ(t) corresponds curve (qµ(τ ), t(τ )) and SL([q(t)]) = SAL ([q(τ ), t(τ )]) for any
parametrization q(τ ). It is easy to see that for densities AL the diﬀerence between com-
plexes (2.10) and (2.14) is removed. To redeﬁnition of Lagrangian L on the constant c
corresponds redeﬁnition of AL on the form cdt.)

III Cohomology of Lagrangians Double Complex and
and its Spectral Sequences.

Now using the technique brieﬂy described in the previous Section and in Appendix 2

we investigate systematically the problem which we considered in Introduction.

We study simultaneously two double complexes, the double complex (E∗.∗, dE.L, δ) of
cochains on G with values in the spaces of the complex C∗ deﬁned by (2.10), {Ep.q, dE.L, δ}
= {Cp(G, Cq), δ, dE.L)} and the double complex (E∗.∗, dE.L, δ) of cochains on G with values
deﬁned by (2.14), {Ep.q, dE.L, δ} = {Cp(G, Cq), dE.L , δ)}.

(The table represented the complex (E∗.∗, dE.L, δ) diﬀers from (3.1) by putting the ”bar”s

The diﬀerential Q of the complex (3.1) is equal to

Q = (−1)qδ + dE.L, for the complex E∗.∗

(3.2)

and correspondingly Q = (−1)qδ + dE.L for the complex E∗.∗.

The problem of weakly invariant Lagrangians classiﬁcation can be reformulated in

terms of these double complexes.

We denote by V0.0 (see Introduction) the subspace of weakly G-invariant Lagrangians

in the space E0.1, i.e. Lagrangians whose motions equations l.h.s. are G-invariant:

V0.0 = {L: L ∈ Λ1

1 and δdE.LL = 0} .

(3.3)

10

One can see that the cochain f = (dE.LL, 0, 0) is the cocycle of diﬀerential Q iﬀ L ∈ V0.0.
The cohomology class [(dE.LL, 0, 0)] of this cocycle belongs to H 2(Q). If we express the
cohomology of diﬀerential Q via the stable terms of transposed spectral sequence { tE∗.∗
r },
i.e. calculating H ∗(Q) in perturbation theory, considering in (3.1) the diﬀerential δ as
zeroth order approximation for the diﬀerential Q, we see that [dE.LV0.0]∞ = tE0.2
∞ is the
subspace of H 2(Q). On the other hand if we express the cohomology of diﬀerential Q via
the stable terms of spectral sequence {E∗.∗

considering in (3.1) the diﬀerential dE.L as zeroth order approximation, we express H 2(Q)

acts operator d1 which is generated by δ and according to

2 .

Indeed if c ∈ E0.1

Now we prove that E0.1

is a constant (c ∈ R) then
d1c is evidently equal to zero. To prove that d1H 1(M ) = 0 we consider the following
homomorphism π from the space of diﬀerential 1-forms into the space of 1-cochains on G
with values in functions on M (the space Λ0(M )):
(πw)(h) = w⌋˜h,

(3.5)
where ˜h is the fundamental vector ﬁeld Φh corresponding to the element h of the Lie

1

algebra G by (2.1).

From the standard formulae of diﬀerential geometry it follows that

(3.6)
Hence for the cohomology class [w] in H 1(M ) d1[w] = [δw] = [dπw] = 0 in E1.1
1 .

if dw = 0 then δπw = 0 and δw = dπw.

Hence Z0.1

Now we calculate E1.1

The straightforward calculations using (3.5, 3.6) give that

d1[c]1 =

[δt(λ) ⊗ w(λ) + δt′ + d(. . .)] = 0 ⇒ δt(λ) = 0 and δt′ = 0 .

One can show that the spaces {Ep.q

are stable: Ep.q

2 = Ep.q

3 = . . . = Ep.q

∞ . (The same for {Ep.q

2 }.)

It is evident without any calculations for the spaces E0.0

because diﬀerentials
d2 which acts on these spaces goes out of the table and the boundaries are zero by the
same reasons. The spaces E0.1
are stable because the diﬀerential d2 acting
2
from the space E0.1
transforms it to zero. It follows from eq. (3.5):
d2[w] = [Q(w, πw)] = [δπw] = 0. The same arguments lead to the stability of the space
E1.1

2 . One can perform the analogous considerations for the spaces {Ep.q

into the space E2.0

and E2.0

Hence the tables (3.9) establish the relations between the spaces H m(Q), H m(Q)

see from (A2.11) that

H 1(G) ⊆ H 1(Q) and H 1(M ) ⊕ R = H 1(Q)

(3.10)
These relations deﬁne canonical projection p1 of H 1(Q) on H 1(M ) ⊕ R and isomor-
phism ι1 of kerp1 on H 1(G): If L = (L, α) is a cocycle of Q then L = w + c where w is a
closed form and c is a constant and p1([L]) = [w] + c. If c = 0 and w = df then α − δf is
1-cocycle in constants which is equal to ι1([L]).

(cid:14)

Using the homomorphism (3.5) one can establish also the isomorphism
[w] + t + c −→ [w + c, t + πw]

H 1(M ) ⊕ H 1(G) ⊕ R −→ H 1(Q):

(3.11)

which corresponds to (3.10) and splits H 1(Q) on components.
The analogous considerations for the table E∗.∗

lead to formulae analogous to (3.10,

2

3.11): H 1(G) ⊆ H 1(Q) and H 1(M ) = H 1(Q)

H 1(G); H 1(M ) ⊕ H 1(G) = H 1(Q).

Considering in the same way the second ”antidiagonal” {E0.2

∞ , E1.1

∞ , E2.0

∞ } in (3.9) we

see that

H 2(G) ⊆ H 2(Q) and H 1(M ) ⊗ H 1(G) ⊕ H 1(G) = H 2(Q)

H 2(G) .

(3.12)

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

These relations deﬁne canonical projection

p2: H 2(Q) −→ H 1(M ) ⊗ H 1(G) + H 1(G)

and on the kernel of p2 the isomorphism

ι2: kerp2 −→ H 2(G).

(3.13)

(3.14)

We consider now (3.13) and (3.14) in components.
Let f = [F , λ, f ] ∈ H 2(Q) be a cohomology class of cocycle (F , λ, f ): Q(F , λ, f ) = 0.
dE.Lλ = −δF , δλ = df, δf = 0. (F ∈ E0.2, λ ∈ E1.1, f ∈ E0.2). The space E0.2 contains
only coboundaries, so cocycle (F , λ, f ) is cohomological to (0, λ′, f ) where λ′ = λ − δL
(L: F = dE.LL). dE.Lλ′ = 0, so from Proposition 1 it follows that 1-cochain λ′ takes values
in closed diﬀerential 1-forms + constants:

(3.15)
Using (3.7,3.8) we see that to λ′ corresponds element of H 1(M ) ⊗ H 1(G) ⊕ H 1(G)

∀h ∈ G λ′(h) = w(h) + t(h).

which is nothing but p2(f ).

In the case if p2(f ) = 0 then it means that λ′ = dα where α ∈ E1.0 and the cocycle
(0, λ′, f ) is cohomological to a cocycle (0, 0, f − δα). d(f − δα) = 0 so f − δα is cocycle in
Z2(G). The cohomology class of f − δα in H 2(G) is nothing but ι2(f ).

The analogous considerations for the second ”antidiagonal” in the table E∗.∗
lead
to the analogous conclusions for H 2(Q): H 2(G) ⊆ H 2(Q) and H 1(M ) ⊗ H 1(G) =
H 2(Q)
H 2(G); p2: H 2(Q) −→ H 1(M )⊗H 1(G). On the kernel of p2 is deﬁned isomorphism
ι2:

kerp2 −→ H 2(G).
(cid:14)
From the considerations above we see that natural relations between complexes

2

(E∗.∗, dE.L, δ), (E∗.∗, dE.L, δ) lead to isomorphisms

H 1(Q) = H 1(Q) ⊕ R, H 2(Q) = H 2(Q) ⊕ H 1(G) .

(3.16)

The decomposition of H 2(Q) deﬁnes the projection
σ: H 2(Q) → H 1(G).

(3.17)
σ(f ) is equal to the element of H 1(G) in the r.h.s. of the eq. (3.15). This projection
will be useful for extracting Lagrangians whose Noether charges are time independent in
the space V0.0 of weakly invariant Lagrangians.

Now we return again to the complex (3.1) and express the cohomologies of H(Q) and

H(Q) in terms of transposed spectral sequences { tE∗.∗

follows that tE0.2 = dE.LV0.0 also.

weakly G-invariant Lagrangians.

IV The calculation of the hierarchy

Now using the calculations of the previous section for a given pair [G, M ] we establish

the hierarchy in the space of weakly G-invariant Lagrangians.

Let U be an arbitrary subspace in the space Λ1

1(M ) of the classical mechanics La-

grangians on M .

Let U0.0 be the subspace of weakly G-invariant Lagrangians in U: U0.0 = V0.0∩U, where
V0.0 is the subspace (3.3) of the all weakly G-invariant Lagrangians in Λ1
1(M ). From the
Proposition 1 and (3.3) it follows that for an arbitrary L in U the condition that L ∈ U0.0
is equivalent to the condition that the cochain δL takes values in closed diﬀerential forms
+ constants:

δdE.LL = 0 ⇔ δiL = wiµ ˙qµ + ti and dwi = dti = 0 .
(Compare with (1.11).)

(4.1)

δiL is the value of the cochain δL on the basis vector ei of the Lie algebra G. (As always
we identify diﬀerential forms with Lagrangians corresponding to them by (2.4))

Using the homomorphism Π3 deﬁned by (3.22) and the projection homomorphism
(3.17) σ2 of H 2(Q) on H 1(G) we consider the following composed homomorphism: Ψ =
σ ◦ Π3: U0.0 → H 2(Q) → K0 = H 1(G). In the components according to (3.15), Ψi(L) = ti
where ti is deﬁned by (4.1). We denote by U0.1 the kernel of this homomorphism. In the
case U = Λ1

1(M ) it is just the space V0.1 in (1.14) deﬁned by the condition (1.12).
Now on the subspaces of U0.1 and on the subspaces of U0.0 using the Proposition 2 we
deﬁne in the recurrent way the homomorphisms {φs} and correspondingly {φs} such that
every homomorphism is deﬁned on the kernel of previous one. Moreover the deﬁnition
spaces for these homomorphisms will be related via the homomorphism Ψ.

Using the statement a) of the Proposition 2 we consider the composed homomorphisms
φ1 = p2 ◦ Π3: U0.0 → H 2(Q) → H 1(M ) ⊗ H 1(G) ⊕ H 1(G) and φ1 = p2 ◦ Π3: U0.0 →
H 2(Q) → K1 = H 1(M ) ⊗ H 1(G). From (3.15, 16) it follows that the restriction of φ1 on

15

the subspace U0.1 coincides with φ1. We denote by U1.0 the kernel of the homomorphism φ1
and by U1.1 the kernel of the homomorphism φ1. U1.1 is also the kernel of homomorphism Ψ
restricted on U1.0 . On the spaces U1.1 and U1.0 one can consider composed homomorphisms
φ2 = ι2 ◦ Π3: U1.1 → H 2(Q) → K2 = H 2(G) and φ2 = ι2 ◦ Π3: U1.0 → H 2(Q) → K2
correspondingly. φ2 evidently coincides with φ2 on U1.1.

For example if for Lagrangian L in U the condition (4.1) is satisﬁed, i.e. L ∈ U0.0,
then φ1(L) is equal to the cohomology class of wiµdqµ in H 1(G) ⊗ H 1(M ) deﬁned by (3.7);
L ∈ U1.0 iﬀ {wiµdqµ} are exact forms. In this case φ2(L) is equal to the cohomology class
in H 2(G) of the cocycle fij = (δα)ij where dαi = wi. If ti = 0 also then L ∈ U1.1.

We denote by U2.0 the kernel of homomorphism φ2 and by U2.1 the kernel of homo-

morphism φ2. It is easy to see that U2.1 = kerΨ|U2.0 .

For every Lagrangian L ∈ U2.1, Π3(L) = 0. From the statement b) of the Proposition

2 it follows that one can consider the composed homomorphism

φ3 = ( td2)−1 ◦ Π2: U2.1 → tE0.2

2 → K3 =
Performing the analogous considerations for the space U2.0 we can consider the com-

H1(G,Λ0(M ))
(H1(M )⊕H1 (G))/H1

inv(M )

posed homomorphism φ3 = ( td2)−1 ◦ Π2: U2.0 → tE0.2

2 → K3.

One can see that in this case as in the previous ones, φ3|U2.1 = φ3 and U3.1 = kerΨ|U3.0

also, where we denote by U3.1, U3.0 the kernels of φ3 and φ3 correspondingly.

For example in the case if L in (4.1) belongs to U2.1 then one can choose αi such that
dai = wiµdxµ and (δα)ij = 0 because φ2(L) = 0. The equivalence class of αi in K3 is
φ3(L).

In the case if L ∈ U3.1 then Π2(L) = 0. It means that the value of the homomorphism
Π1 (see 3.22) on this Lagrangian is equal to the value of this homomorphism on some G-
invariant Lagrangian: Π1(L) = dE.LL = dE.LLinv. From Proposition 1 it follows that L =
Linv +w where closed diﬀerential 1-form w is deﬁned uniquely up to closed G-invariant form
and exact form. This deﬁnes the homomorphism φ4(L): U3.1 → K4 = H 1(M )/(H 1
inv(M ))∗
where (H 1
inv(M ) in H 1(M ) under the canonical homomorphism.
More formally φ4 can be deﬁned as composed homomorphism with values in the kernel
tE0.1
(3.21) of the diﬀerential td2 (see the statement c) of the Proposition 2): On the
3
space U3.1 the image of Π1 belongs to the image of diﬀerential td1 acting on the space
in the table (3.18), hence φ4 = π ◦ (id − ( td1)−1dE.L): U3.1 → E0.1 → K4 ⊆ tE1.0
tE0.1
1
where π is deﬁned by (3.5).

inv(M ))∗ is the image of H 1

3

Analogously one can deﬁne the homomorphism φ4(L): U3.0 → K4.
Similarly to previous cases φ4|U3.1 = φ4 and U4.1 = kerΨ|U4.0 also, where we denote

by U4.1, U4.0 the kernels of φ3 and φ3 correspondingly.

From the deﬁnitions of φ4 and φ4 it is evident that Lagrangians belonging to U4.1 can

be reduced to G-invariant by the redeﬁnition on exact form (full derivative.)

The spaces {Us.1, Us.0} constructed here coincide with the spaces {Vs.1, Vs.0} consid-

ered in the Introduction. (see (1.14, 1.15)) in the case if U = Λ1

1(M ).

These considerations can be summarized in the
Theorem. Let U be an arbitrary subspace in the space of classical mechanics La-
grangians for a given [G, M ] pair. Let U0.0 be the subspace of U deﬁned by (4.1) which
contains the weakly G-invariant Lagrangians in U. Then the following relations which

The spaces Us.σ are intersections of the space U with the spaces Vs.σ deﬁned in Introduc-
tion (see 1.6–1.15); the double ﬁltration {Us.σ} is subordinated to the homomorphisms
{φs, φs, Ψ} constructed above:

Us.0 = ker(φs: Us−1.0 → Ks), Us.1 = ker(φs: Us−1.1 → Ks),

Us.1 = ker(Ψ: Us.0 → K0), φs

= φs.

We denote the diagram (4.2) by D([G, M ], U) and call it the hierarchy diagram for the
1(M ) is the space of all Lagrangians of classical mechanics

subspace U. In the case if U = Λ1
on M we denote the diagram D([G, M ], U) shortly by D([G, M ]).

The diagram D([G, M ], U) measures the diﬀerences in the spaces {Us.σ} for an arbi-

Us−1.1
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

trary subspace U.

We say that weakly G-invariant Lagrangian L ∈ U is on the ﬂoor ”s” if L ∈ Us.0 and

L 6∈ Us+1.0. (All Lagrangians from U4.0 are on the 4-th ﬂoor.)

We say that weakly G-invariant Lagrangian L is on the ﬂoor ”s+” if this Lagrangian
is on the ﬂoor ”s” and it belongs to Us.1. All other Lagrangians from the ﬂoor ”s” are on
the ﬂoor ”s−”.

All Lagrangians which are on the ” + ”-th ﬂoors have time independent Noether

charges, except Lagrangians in zeroth ﬂoor.

The Lagrangians which are on the ﬂoor ”s” have non-trivial image in the space Ks+1
in (4.2). The Lagrangian on ﬂoor ”s−” have also non-trivial image in K0 under homomor-
phism Ψ.

Returning to the table (1.6) in Introduction we can conclude that a Lagrangian which
possesses the property ”s” in (1.6) and which does not possesses the property ”s + 1” in
(1.6) does have non-trivial image in the space Ks+1.

The evident but important corollary of the hierarchy diagram is that the ﬂoor is
empty if the corresponding space Ks is trivial. For example in the case if the ﬁrst de
Rham cohomology of conﬁguration space are trivial then K1 = K4 = 0 and the zeroth
ﬂoor and the third ﬂoors are empty. In the case if the algebra G is semisimple only the
ﬂoors 2+, 3+, 4+ can be non empty, because in this case H 1(G) = H 2(G) = 0, hence
K0 = K1 = K2 = 0.

17

The hierarchy diagram will be called trivial if all the spaces Ks are equal to zero.
In general the inverse statement is not valid. From the fact that the space Ks is not
trivial does not follow that the ﬂoor ”s − 1” is not empty, because the homomorphisms in
(4.2) are not in general surjective. For example homomorphism φ2 in general is not sur-
jective because the map td2 which induces this homomorphism is deﬁned on the subspace
tE0.1
2

of the space H 1(G, Λ0(M )).

We say that the diagram D([G, M ], U) is full on the ﬂoor ”s+” (s < 4) if φs+1 is
homomorphism onto the space Ks (surjective homomorphism), we say that this diagram
is full on the ﬂoor ”s−”- if the restriction of Ψ on Us.1 is the surjective homomorphism.
In the case if the diagram is full on the ﬂoors ”s+” and ”s−” we say that it is full on the
ﬂoor ”s”.

For a given pair [G, M ] two subspaces U and U ′ in the space Λ1

1(M ) of classical
mechanics Lagrangians on M will be called equivalent with respect to the hierarchy if the
images of all the homomorphisms {φs, φs, Ψ|Us.1} for the diagram D([G, M ], U ′) coincide
It is
with the images of corresponding homomorphisms for the diagram D([G, M ], U).
evident that in this case for arbitrary L ∈ U there exists L′ ∈ U ′ such that L′ − L belongs
to the space U4.1, i.e.

L′ = L + Linv + full derivative.
This construction can be used for deﬁning in the space U0.0 a gradation corresponding to
the ﬁltration (4.2) (See the examples in the next Section.)

(4.3)

Now we use it for simplifying the diagram (4.2) for physically important subspace U pol
of Lagrangians which are polynomial in velocities. Let U f = Ω1(M ) be a subspace of formal
Lagrangians in U pol which correspond to diﬀerential forms by (2.4), and U sc = Λ0(M ) be
a subspace of formal Lagrangians in U pol which are functions on M .

One can see that the space U pol is equivalent to the space U f ⊕ U sc with respect to

the hierarchy.

To prove it we note that every L in U pol can be represented as

L(q, ˙q) =

Ln(q, ˙q) =

Ln(q, ˙q) + Aµ(q) ˙qµ + ϕ(q) .

(4.4)

Xn≥0

Xn≥2
where Ln(q, ˙q) is the polynom of ˙q of the order n. Using the fact that the Lie derivative does
not change the order of polynom ((δL)n = δ(Ln)) one can see that for homomorphism Ψ are
responsible the functions on M and for homomorphisms φs, φs are responsible polynoms
which are linear by velocities, i.e. diﬀerential 1-forms: Ψ(L) = Ψ(ϕ), φs(L) = φs(L) =
φs(Aµ ˙qµ). This proves the equivalence.

The homomorphism Ψ takes values in the subspace of H 1(G) which is isomorphic to the
inv(M ),

inv(M ) which are trivial in H 1(M ): If δϕ ∈ H 1(G) then dϕ ∈ H 1

cohomologies of H 1
if w ∈ H 1

inv(M ) and w = dϕ then δϕ ∈ H 1(G).

From these facts it follows that for the diagram D([G, M ], U pol) the following additional

relations are satisﬁed:

Here B = U sc

s.1 ⊕ B, U pol

s.0 = U pol

Weakly G-invariant Lagrangians which belong to the space U pol diﬀer from the La-
grangians in U pol
4.1 (G-invariant Lagrangians up to a full derivative) on the interaction with
”electromagnetic ﬁeld” whose ﬁeld strength is G-invariant.
In particular a Lagrangian
which is on the ﬂoor ”s−” diﬀers from Lagrangian which is on the ﬂoor ”s+” on the in-
teraction with ”electric” ﬁeld”–1-form Eµ = ∂ϕ/∂qµ. The value of this 1-form on every
symmetries vector ﬁeld is constant: Eµ(q)eµ
i (q)} are fundamental vec-
tor ﬁelds corresponding to the basis {ei} in Lie algebra G via the map (2.1). The time
dependence of corresponding Noether charge is proportional to ti.

i (q) = ti where {eµ

In general for an arbitrary Lagrangian in V these properties are not satisﬁed. (See

e.g. Example 1 in the Section 5.)

The second physically important example of the subspace is the subspace U dens of

Lagrangians on M which are densities. (See the Remark in the 2-nd Section).

It is easy to see that in this case Us.1 = Us.0, i.e. all the ﬂoors ”s−” are empty, because

the homomorphism Ψ is trivial. (See the end of the 2-nd Section).

We do not consider here systematically the general methods to handle with calcula-
tions of the spaces Ks and corresponding homomorphisms for an arbitrary pair [G, M ], but
we note only some points which can be useful for analyzing the content of the space K3 in
the hierarchy diagram and the groups H 1(G, Λ0(M )) which generate these spaces.

First we note that the basic example of the [G, M ] pair is provided with the following
construction. Let M ⊆ N be the subspace of a space N and the action of a Lie group G is
deﬁned on N . The action of G on N deﬁnes the pair [G, N ] as well as the pair [G, M ] where
G = G(G) is the Lie algebra of the group G. This pair in general cannot be generated by
the action of a group on M .

We say that the pair [G, M ] is transitive if fundamental vector ﬁelds span the tangent

bundle T M : ∀q ∈ M ImΦ

For example it is the case if the action of Lie algebra G on M is generated by transitive

q = TqM . (Φ deﬁnes the action of G on M by (2.1).)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

action of Lie group.

For a given [G, M ] we can consider the stability subalgebra Gst(q) for every point
q ∈ M : Gst(q) = {G ∋ x: Φ(x)|q = 0}. In the case if the pair [G, M ] is generated by the
action of a group G, Gst(q) is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of stability subgroup of any
point q0.

Let [G, M ] be a transitive pair. (The constructions below can be generalized on non-

transitive case also).

If α is cocycle representing the cohomology class in H 1(G, Λ0(M )) then at arbitrary
point q0 it vanishes on the vectors in commutant [Gst(q0), Gst(q0)]. If this cocycle is gen-
erated by one-form w via homomorphism π, deﬁned by (3.5) (α = πw) then it vanishes
at arbitrary point q0 on all the vectors in Gst(q0). Moreover πw is a coboundary iﬀ w is
coboundary. Thus for any point q ∈ M one can consider homomorphisms

H 1(M )

[π]
֒→H 1(G, Λ0(M ))

ρq−→H 1(Gst(q0)), [π] is the injection and ρq ◦ [π] = 0, .

(4.6)

In the case if the pair [G, M ] is generated by transitive action of Lie group G (on
N : M ⊆ N ), then the image of the injection [π] coincides with the kernel of ρq for an
arbitrary point q, because the homomorphisms ρq for diﬀerent points q are related by the
adjoint action of the group transformation:

19

(4.7)

(4.8)

∀(q, q0), ∀ξ ∈ Gst(q0) α(q, Adgξ) = α(q0, ξ) if q = g ◦ q0.

Hence in this case K3 can be injected in the factorspace of H 1Gst(q) for any q:

K3 ⊆ Imρq

Imρq

H1(G)

(cid:14)
It gives the upper estimation for the dimension of the space K3. (To calculate (4.8) it
is useful to note that from deﬁnition of the space K3, (3.21) and (3.5) it follows that
the elements of K3 are cocycles in Z1(G, Λ0(M )) factorized by cocycles which can be
representing in the form: α = πw + t, where w is closed 1-form and t ∈ H 1(G).)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

One can say more in the case if the pair [G, M ] is generated by the transitive action
of the compact connected Lie group on the same space M . In this case taking the average
of the group action on cocycle one comes to the injective homomorphism of H 1(G, Λ0(M ))
in H 1(G):

δα = 0 ⇒

αgdµG = ¯α: H 1(G, Λ0(M )) ֒→ H 1(G) .

(4.9)

V ol(G)

Z

(dµG is invariant measure on G.)

For example if the pair [G, M ] is transitive and it is generated by the action of
semisimple compact connected Lie group on the space M then using Whitehead lemmas
(H 1(G) = H 2(G) = 0), (4.8, 4.9) we see that all Ks are equal to zero and the hierarchy
diagram is trivial.

The analogous conclusions can be made too in the case if the action is not transitive.

V Examples

Example 1

In this Section using the hierarchy diagram (4.2) and considerations below we consider

some examples of weakly G-invariant Lagrangians classiﬁcation.

This example is the model example. But here we describe in details how to use the
construction (4.3) for establishing gradation corresponding to the hierarchy ﬁltration (4.2).
We consider the following pair [G, M ]. Let G be Lie algebra ℓ3 with generators e1, e2, e3
such that [e1, e2] = e3, [e2, e3] = [e3, e1] = 0. Let a conﬁguration space M be cylinder:
M = R × S1 with coordinates (z, ϕ). The homomorphism Φ (see 2.1) is deﬁned by the
relations

Φe1 = ˜e1 =

, Φe2 = ˜e2 = z

, Φe3 = ˜e3 =

(5.1)

∂
∂ϕ

∂
∂ϕ

.

∂
∂z

This deﬁnes the pair [ℓ3, S1 × R]. For this pair ﬁrst we calculate the hierarchy diagram
D([ℓ3, S1 × R]). We consider as U the whole space Λ1
1(M ). From (5.1) it follows that every
ℓ3-invariant Lagrangian has the form F ( ˙z) where F is an arbitrary function.

Now we calculate the spaces {Ks}. K0 = H 1(G) = R2 is generated by the cochains
e1 and e2 ({ei} are dual to {ej }: ei(ej) = δi
j ). The elements from H 1(G) in components
are ti = (a, b, 0). H 1(M ) = R is generated by 1-form dϕ. Hence K1 = R2 is generated by
cochains (dϕ, 0, 0) and (0, dϕ, 0). K2 = H 2(G) = R2: the cocycles fij such that f12 = 0

20

represent its cohomology class. It is easy to see that H 1
inv(M ) = R is generated by 1-
form dz. The stability subalgebra in every point (z, ϕ) is generated by the vector e2 − ze3,
hence from (4.7) and the result for H 1(G) it follows that K3 = 0. (The explicit calculations
without (4.7) give that H 1(G, Λ0(M )) = R2 is generated by the cocycles αi = (0, az +b, a);
d(0, az + b, a) = (0, adz, 0) = δiadϕ, hence tE1.0

2 = H 1(G, Λ0(M )) and K3 = 0.)

3 = tE1.0

The space K4 = R is generated by the form dϕ. We come to the result

K0 = K1 = K2 = R2, K3 = 0, K4 = R.

(5.2)

We already see that second ﬂoor of D([ℓ3, S1 × R]) is empty.
The special analyze of the homomorphism φ2 leads to the fact that 1-st ﬂoor is empty
∞ and

too: the image of φ2 in K2 is trivial because in this special case the subspaces tE0.2
E2.0

∞ of H 2(Q) have zero intersection.

Now we show that the diagram D([ℓ3, S1 × R]) is full on the all ﬂoors except the

second one and study the content of the spaces {Vs.1, Vs.0}.

For this purpose we consider the following 5-dimensional subspace of formal La-

grangians on S1 × R:

U = {L: L = a ˙ϕ + bz ˙ϕ + cz + d

+

(5.3)

˙ϕ
˙z

q
2

˙ϕ2
˙z

},

where (a, b, c, d, q) are constants.

We show that the diagram D([ℓ3, S1 × R], U ) is full on all the ﬂoors except the ﬁrst
one. From this fact and from the emptiness of ﬁrst ﬂoor for the diagram D([ℓ3, S1 × R])
it follows that the whole space V of classical mechanics Lagrangians on M is equivalent to
its subspace U with respect to the hierarchy. (See (4.3).)

The straightforward calculations give that for arbitrary Lagrangian from U

δ1L = L ∂

L = bdϕ + c, δ2L = Lz ∂

∂z

∂ϕ

L = adz + bzdz + d + qdϕ, δ3L = L ∂

L = 0 .

(5.4)

∂ϕ

Comparing (5,4) with (4.1) we see that U = U0.0.

Calculate the homomorphisms {Ψ, φs, φs} for the diagram D([ℓ3, S1 × R], U ) using
(5.2–5.4). φ2 = φ2 = φ3 = φ3 = 0. ∀L ∈ U, Ψ(L) = (c, d, 0) ∈ K0.
If c = d = 0
then L ∈ U0.1. φ1(L) = φ1(L) = (bdφ, qdϕ, 0) ∈ K1.
If b = q = 0 then L ∈ U1.0
and if c = d = b = 0 then L ∈ U1.1. Hence U3.0 = U2.0 = U1.0 and correspondingly
U3.1 = U2.1 = U1.0. φ4(L) = φ4(L) = adϕ ∈ K4. If a = b = q = 0 then we come to U4.0. If
also c = d = 0 then we come to U4.1 = 0.

All these homomorphisms except φ2, φ2 are surjective. Hence the space Λ1
1(M ) is
reduced to its subspace U with respect to the hierarchy. Moreover these homomorphisms
are injective on corresponding factor spaces. (ImΨ = U0.0/U1.0, Imφs = Us−1.1/Us.1 and
Imφs = Us−1.0/Us.0 if s 6= 2.)

From these considerations and (4.3) it follows that for every weakly ℓ3-invariant La-

grangian there exists unique Lagrangian in U such that their diﬀerence belongs to V4.1:

∀L ∈ V0.0 ∃!(a, b, c, d, q): L = F ( ˙z) + full derivative + a ˙ϕ + bz ˙ϕ + cz + d

+

. (5.5)

Finally we come to the following gradation in the space V0.0 of weakly ℓ3-invariant La-
grangians on S1 × R:

V3.1 = V2.1 = V1.1 = V4.1 ⊕ K4 = V4.1 ⊕ R,
V0.1 = V1.1 ⊕ K1 = V1.1 ⊕ R2, Vs.0 = Vs.1 ⊕ K0 = Vs.1 ⊕ R2 .

(5.6)

We consider also brieﬂy the diagram D([ℓ3, S1 × R], U pol) where U pol is the subspace of
Lagrangians which are polynomial in velocities. (See the end of 4-th Section.) It is easy
to see that U pol is reduced to the three-dimensional space U pol which is the subspace of U
deﬁned by the additional conditions d = q = 0 in (5.3). The diagram D([ℓ3, S1×R], U pol) is
not full on all the ﬂoors {s−} and on the ﬂoors 0+ and 1+. (One can show that in this case
ImΨ = R 6= K0, Imφ1 = R 6= K1). The space U pol
0.0 is parametrized by three-dimensional
space U pol (up to U pol

4.1 ) analogously to (5.5, 5.6) with conditions d = q = 0.
We note that in (5.5) the term d( ˙ϕ/ ˙z) which is responsible for time dependent Noether
charges cannot be considered as interaction with ”electric ﬁeld” as in the case of La-
grangians in U pol.

We want to note also that all the considerations which lead to the formula (5.6) (except
the property of homomorphism φ2) where based on general relations which are established
by the diagram (4.2).

Example 2

Let M = Rn be an n-dimensional linear space which acts on itself by translations. It
deﬁnes the pair [Rn, Rn]. (We identify the aﬃne space with corresponding linear space
and with abelian algebra of translations.) It is easy to see that K0 = Rn, K2 = Rn ∧
Rn, K1 = K3 = K4 = 0. The space of Lagrangians on Rn is equivalent to the space
U = {L: L = w2(q, ˙q) + w1(q)} with respect to the hierarchy, where w2, w1 are 2-cocycle
and 1-cocycle correspondingly on the Lie algebra Rn. (The tangent vectors on Rn can be
identiﬁed with points.) In the same way like in (5.3–5.5) we come to the statement that
every weakly G-invariant Lagrangian in this case has the form

L = F ( ˙q1, . . . , ˙qn)+ full derivative +Bikqi ˙qk + Eiqi.

It describes the interaction with constant ”magnetic” and ”electric” ﬁelds. (Compare
with (1.5)). The corresponding Noether charges are Ni(q, ˙q, t) = ∂L/∂ ˙qi − Bikqk − Eit.
The corresponding gradation of the space V0.0 is the following:
V4.1 = V3.1 = V2.1, V1.1 = V0.1 = V4.1 ⊕ R

, Vs.0 = Vs.1 ⊕ Rn.

n(n−1)

This case is famous in literature as ”arising of constant magnetic ﬁled as central

extension of translations algebra [2].”

Example 3. so(3) algebra.

In this example we consider the Lie algebra so(3) which is the special case of semisimple
algebra. Let M = R3 be 3-dimensional linear space with cartesian coordinates (x1, x2, x3).
We consider ﬁrst the pairs [so(3), R3] and [so(3), S2] where S2 is the sphere xixi = 1 in
R3 and the action of so(3) on R3 is generated by the standard action of the group SO(3)
if {e1, e2, e3} is a basis in so(3) such that [ei, ej] = εijkek then Φ(ei) = ˜Li =
on R3:
−εijkxj∂/∂xk. For the pair [so(3), R3] the hierarchy diagram is trivial because SO(3) is
semisimple compact group. (See the end of the Section IV.)

22

Alternatively one can see it by the following explicit calculations: From commutation
relations it is evident that H 1(so(3)) = H 2(so(3)) = 0. Hence K0 = K1 = K2 = K4 = 0.
If αi is a cocycle with values in functions on S2 then 0 = δα = ˜Liαk − ˜Lkαi − εijkαk.
F l
Hence ˜L2αk = ˜Lk( ˜Liαi) = ˜LkF and αk = δ ˜F is coboundary where ˜F =
l(l+1) . (F l is
deﬁned by the expansion over the spherical harmonics of F . The term F 0 = 0 because it
leads to cocycle in constants and H 1(so(3)) = 0.) Hence K3 = 0 also.

P

l

The calculations and the result are the same for the diagram [so(3), R3].
We come to the result that all weakly so(3) invariant Lagrangians of classical mechan-

ics on R3 and on S2 are exhausted by so(3)-invariant ones (up to a full derivative).

Now bearing in mind the construction (4.6) we modify little bit this example con-
sidering instead the sphere S2 the domain in it, the sphere without North pole (punc-
tured sphere) S2\N ] (x3 6= 1). Thus we come from the pair [so(3), S2] to the pair
[so(3), S2\N ]. In the same way we come to the pair [so(3), R3\L+], taking out the ray L+
(x1 = 0, x2 = 0, x3 ≥ 0) from R3.

The essential diﬀerence of these pairs from the previous ones is that they cannot be

generated by the action of the corresponding Lie group.

We perform the calculations for the diagram D([so(3), S2\N ]).
It is evident that for this diagram K0 = K1 = K2 = K4 = 0, also. Now we show that

for this diagram K3 = R and this hierarchy is full.

The stability algebra for this pair is one dimensional, hence from (4.6–4.8) it follows

that K3 = 0 or K3 = R. It remains to prove that K3 is not trivial.

To show it we consider the Lagrangian L which corresponds to the diﬀerential form
A = −(1 + cosθ)dϕ on the punctured sphere S2\N . (θ, ϕ are spherical coordinates.) The
two-form dA = F = sinθdθdϕ corresponding to its motion equations is so(3)-invariant,
hence this Lagrangian is weakly so(3)-invariant. On the other hand it cannot be reduced
to so(3)-invariant by redeﬁnition on a full derivative df because so(3)-invariant 1-form on
the sphere is equal to zero. Hence, because all other spaces Ks are equal to zero. this
Lagrangian belongs to the ﬂoor 2+. We come to the result:

K3 = H 1(so(3), Λ0(S2\N )) = R and φ2(A) ∈ K3 6= 0,

(5.7)

For this special case the explicit realization of (4.6-4.8) is the following: We identify the
vectors in R3 with the vectors in the linear space of the Lie algebra so(3) by the linear
map γ: (x1, x2, x3) → x1e1 + x2e2 + x3e3. For any point x ∈ S2 the corresponding stability
subalgebra is generated by γ(x). To (4.6–4.7) corresponds the following statement: If α is
a 1-cocycle with values in functions on the punctured sphere then
α(x, γ(x)) = xiαi(x) is a constant on the sphere,
this constant is equal to zero iﬀ this cocycle is a coboundary.

(5.8a)
(5.8b)
(This statement can be easily proved in a straightforward way without using (4.6,4.7)).
We proved that K3 = R and all other Ks are equal to zero and presented in (5.7) the
Lagrangian with non-trivial image in K3. Hence the hierarchy diagram D([so(3), S2\N ])
is full on all the ﬂoors and the space of classiclal mechanics Lagrangians is equivalent to
the one-dimensional space U = {L: L = −q(1 + cosθ ˙ϕ)} with respect to this hierarchy. So
using (4.3) we arrive at the statement that every weakly so(3) invariant Lagrangian on the

23

punctured sphere has the form

L = Linv + full derivatives − g(1 + cosθ) ˙ϕ .

(5.9)

In the case g 6= 0 it belongs to the ﬂoor 2+ of the hierarchy.

The calculations for the diagram D[so(3), R3\l+] are analogous and the result is the

same: every weakly so(3) invariant Lagrangian on the R3\l+ has the form (5.9).

One can see that in the case if Linv is free particle Lagrangian, then (5.9) corresponds

to the Lagrangian which describes the interaction of particle with Dirac monopole.

The explicit calculations for (5.7) give that φ2(L) for the Lagrangian (5.9) is equal to

the cohomology class in H 1(so(3), S2\N ) of the following cocycle:

α1 = −gctg

cosϕ, α2 = −gctg

sinϕ, α3 = g,

(δL = dα, δα = 0)

(5.10)

θ
2

θ

and αixi = −g.

Finally we make the following remark about the Lagrangian (5.9)
Via stereographic projection of the punctured sphere on R2 one comes from the pair
[so(3], S2\N ] to the pair [so(3), R2], where the fundamental vector ﬁeld corresponding to e3
corresponds to rotations and fundamental vector ﬁelds corresponding to e1, e2 correspond
to non-linear inﬁnitesimal transformations. The weakly so(3)-invariant Lagrangian (5.9)
transforms to the

L =

m( ˙u2 + ˙v2)

2(1 + u2 + v2)2 + g

u ˙v − v ˙u
1 + u2 + v2

(5.11)

in the case if Linv is free particle Lagrangian.

The Lagrangian (5.11) in the case g = 0 is strictly related with the Lagrangian which
describes the interaction of free particle in 2-dimensional plane with Coulomb potential.
To the vector ﬁelds ˜e1, ˜e2 correspond so called hiiden symmetries of Coulomb interaction
which lead to Runge–Lentz vector [19]. So, Lagrangian (5.11) leads to the Lagrangian
which possesses essentially generalized hidden symmetries of two-dimensional Coulomb
potential. These consideration deal with so called higher symmetries which are not in the
frame of this paper.

Example 4. Galilean and Poincar´e Lie algebras

To threat these algebras simultaneously we consider 1-parametric family of Poincar´e
Lie algebras G(Pc) (c is the ”velocity of light”). Their action (2.1) on the space R4
with cartesian coordinates (t, x1, x2, x3) is generated in a standard way via the following
fundamental vector ﬁelds:

˜p0 =

, ˜pi =

∂
∂t

∂
∂xi , ˜Bi = t

∂
∂xi +

1

c2 xi ∂

∂t

, ˜Li = −εijkxj ∂

∂xk .

(5.12)

which correspond to its basis. The relations (5.12) deﬁne the pair [G(Pc), R4].

In the case c → ∞ Lie algebra G(Pc) is contracted to the Lie algebra G(Γ) of Galilean
(All the commutation

group (non-relativistic limit) which we denote also by G(P∞).

24

relations of basis vectors in G(Pc) do not depend on c, except the relations [ ˜Bi, ˜Bk] =
−1/c2εijk ˜Lk, [˜pi, ˜Bk] = −1/c2p0δik which tend to zero if c tends to zero.)

Correspondingly to (5.12) the action of the Galilean Lie algebra G(P∞) on R4 is

generated via the vector ﬁelds:

∂
∂t

,

∂
∂xi ,

t

∂

∂xi , Li = −εijkxj ∂
∂xk .

(5.13)

(5.14)

It deﬁnes the pair [G(P∞), R4]. (The vector ﬁeld corresponding to Lorentz boost trans-
forms to vector ﬁeld corresponding to special Galilean transformation.)

The ﬁrst two cohomologies groups for algebras G(Pc) are

H 1(G(Pc)) = 0, H 2(G(Pc)) = 0,
H 1(G(P∞)) = 0, H 2(G(P∞)) = R.

if c 6= ∞

The second cohomology group of the Galilean Lie algebra is generated by 2-cocycle cB
(Bargmann cocycle) whose non-vanishing components in the basis (5.13) are only
cB(pi, Bj) = −cB(Bj, pi) = δij.

(5.15)
The relations (5.14) make trivial the calculations of the all spaces Ks except the
space K3 for the hierarchy diagram D(G(Pc), R4). From the formula (4.6) it follows that
K3 = 0 because the stability subalgebra of every point (t0, xi
0) in R4 is isomorphic to the
subalgebra generated by the vectors (Li, Bj) which has only trivial 1-cocycles.

Hence for the hierarchy diagram D(G(Pc), R4) all the spaces Ks are equal to zero,
except K2 which is equal to R for Galilean algebra and which is equal to zero for Poincar´e
algebra.

We see that the hierarchy diagram D(G(Pc), R4) for Poincar´e algebra is trivial. For
Galilean algebra in the diagram D(G(P∞), R4) only the ﬂoors 1+, 4+ can be non-empty.
It has to be noted that the space of Lagrangians L(t, xi, dt/dτ, dxi/dτ ) in R4 is more
wide that the space of classical mechanics Lagrangians L(xi, dxi/dt) on the conﬁguration
space R3. To every Lagrangian in R3 according to (2.16) corresponds Lagrangian which
is a density in R4. On the other hand to every Lagrangian–density L in R4 which does
not depend explicitly on time corresponds the classical mechanics Lagrangian, if we put
the parameter τ = t. For example to the Lagrangian of free non-relativistic particle
corresponds the density in R4 Lnonrel = m ˙xi ˙xi/2 ˙t and to the Lagrangian of free relativistic
c2 ˙t2 − ˙xi ˙xi. (The ˙xi, ˙t means derivatives
particle corresponds the density Lrel(c) = −mc
of x, t with respect to the parameter τ .) The Lagrangian Lrel(c) + mc2 ˙t which diﬀers from
Lrel(c) on the full derivative tends to Lnonrel if c → ∞.

p

The Lagrangian Lrel(c) is G(Pc)-invariant. Lrel(c) is the unique (up to multiplier)

G(Pc)-invariant Lagrangian in the space of densities on R4.

On the other hand it is evident that there are no G(P∞)-invariant Lagrangians in the
space of densities on R4, except trivial ones. The Lagrangian Lnonrel is weakly G(P∞)-
invariant:

Lp0 Lnonrel = LpiLnonrel = LLiLnonrel = 0, LBiLnonrel = m ˙xi .

(5.16)

From (5.16) it follows that δL = dα where the values of the cocycle α on the basis vectors
Bi are equal to mxi, on all other basis vectors α is equal to zero. Hence

25

δα = mcB,

(5.17)

where cB is Bargmann cocycle (5.15).
We proved before that for the diagram D([G(P∞)], R4), K2 = R and all other Ks are
equal to zero. On the other hand it follows from (5.16,5.17) that the homomorphism φ2
for the diagram D([G(P∞)], R4) has non-trivial image in K2 at the Lagrangian Lnonrel.
Hence the space of all weakly G(P∞)-invariant Lagrangians on R4 is equivalent to the
one-dimensional space generated by the Lagrangian of free non-relativistic particle.

We come to the following conclusion:
Every weakly G(P∞)-invariant Lagrangian which is a density in R4 belongs to the
ﬂoor 1+ and is proportional to Lnonrel (up to full derivative and a constant). The ﬂoor
4+ contains only trivial Lagrangians.

Correspondingly for the Poincar´e algebra every weakly G(Pc)-invariant Lagrangian-

density coincides (up to full derivatives) with G(Pc)-invariant Lagrangian Lrel(c).

On one hand to the contraction of Poincar´e algebra to Galilean algebra corresponds
the arising of Bargmann cocycle. On the other hand the unique non-trivial component
V4.1 of the hierarchy diagram for Poincar´e algebra transforms to the unique non-trivial
component V1.1 of the hierarchy diagram for Galilean algebra.

The vanishing of H 2(G(Pc)) is the reason why in relativistic quantum mechanics the
projective representation of Poincar´e symmetries in the space of states (which are rays
in linear Hilbert space) can be reduced to linear one and because of (5.15) it is not the
case in non-relativistic mechanics. The considerations of this example are reﬂection of this
phenomenon.

VI Discussions

The problem considered here and the technique which we used to study it can be
generalized in a few directions. The considerations of this paper can be easily translated
to Hamiltonian language. One can consider the classiﬁcation of Lagrangians not only for
symmetries induced by point transformations of conﬁguration space but by the so called
higher symmetries. For example from this point of view it is interesting to analyze the
generalized Runge–Lentz symmetries (see the end of Example 3 in Section V).

It is interesting to apply this method to supersymmetrical case [12]. It seems to be
interesting also to analyze the phenomena of spin-like transformations (1.9) arising for
Lagrangians from the second ﬂoor of the hierarchy (4.2), in order to apply it to Dirac
monopoles [20].

We hope that a generalization of this method on ﬁeld theory Lagrangians will be
fruitful. From this point of view we want to note the relations of our considerations with
the problem of the Ward identities anomaly absence for ﬁeld theory Lagrangians which
possess classically the given symmetry [21,10].

To develop this technique for ﬁeld theory Lagrangians, the ﬁrst order formalism and
multisymplectic formalism become very useful [19]. We would wish to develop these con-
siderations on the ﬁrm ground of investigations of A.M. Vinogradov and his collaborators
[22].

On the other hand, in our opinion, the method considered in this paper maybe is more

important than the problem we applied it to.

26

We give here only three examples, one of them pure mathematical, where the calcu-
lations of double comlex cohomology (the method we use in this paper) make a bridge
between the corresponding structures.

1. The calculation of de Rham cohomology in terms of Chech cohomology.
When manifold M is covered by the family {Uα} of open sets one can consider Chech
cohomology of this covering. Then one can consider double complex of q-forms which
are deﬁned on the sets {Uα}. The diﬀerential Q of this complex is the sum of de Rham
exterior diﬀerential and Chech diﬀerential. Considering the diﬀerential Q ”perturbatively”
around Chech diﬀerential one arrives naturally at de Rham cohomology of M , hence the
”perturbative” calculations around de Rham diﬀerential lead in general to calculation of
spectral sequence which tends to de Rham cohomology of M . In the case if the covering
is Leray covering, i.e. all the sets and their intersections are convex connected sets then
Chech cohomology coincide with de Rham one; the application of Poincar´e lemma reduces
spectral sequence calculations to trivial resolutions of descent equations. But practically
it is more convenient to use for calculations a suitable covering which generally is not a
Leray covering. (See for details e.g. [23].).

2. The relations between Hamiltonian reduction method and BRST cohomology for

classical mechanics

One can say that the relations between these two methods are encoded in the coho-
mology of double complex diﬀerential Q = ∂ + δ in the case if constraints form Lie algebra
(so called closed groups.) Here ∂ corresponds to Koszul diﬀerential of complex generated
by constraints and δ is diﬀerential corresponding to Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds which are
induced by these constraints. Perturbative expansion of Q around δ leads to standard
Hamiltonian methods, and expansion around ∂ leads to BRST. In the case if constraints
form so called open group, one has to consider the corresponding ﬁltered space instead of
this double complex [3,4,6]. This approach seems to be very fruitful.

3. Local BRST Cohomology
Considering BRST physical observables as integrals of local functions one comes nat-
urally to diﬀerential Q = s + d, where s is BRST diﬀerential, acting on integrand which is
local function and d is the usual de Rham diﬀerential. It turns out that the consideration
of cohomology of this double complex is a very powerful tool for BRST cohomology inves-
tigations in ﬁeld theory, especially in Lagrangian framework. (See [8,9,10,24] and citations
there).

In spite of these examples one has to note that the method of spectral sequences was

not used actively in these calculations.

May be at ﬁrst the method of spectral sequences was applied in physics by J. Dixon
in [8] in analysis of local BRST cohomology.
In series of works the so called method
of descent equations which is in fact a special case reminiscent of this technique was
applied successfully to these problems. (See the review [10] and the papers citated there).
Nowadays the technique of spectral sequences seems to be not very popular in theoretical
physics. We hope to pay attention to importance of this technique which is used here in a
simple physical frame. In principal using the method ”Deus ex machina” one can formulate
the hierarchy without using explicitly the method used in this paper which indeed seems
to be very tedious. But in our opinion this method is inherent to this problem and it is

27

the adequate technique in other important problems such as constrained dynamics theory;
it may have useful applications in future.

Appendix 1. Lie algebra cohomologies

Let G be Lie algebra and A be a linear space which is module on G, i.e. the action of

G on A which respects the structure of the Lie algebra G and the space A is deﬁned:

h ∈ G, m ∈ A (h, m) → h ◦ m ∈ A:

(λh1 + µh2) ◦ m = λ(h1 ◦ m) + µ(h2 ◦ m),
h ◦ (λm1 + µm2) = λ(h ◦ m1) + µ(h ◦ m2),

(λ, µ ∈ R)

(A1.1)

h1 ◦ (h2 ◦ m) − h2 ◦ (h1 ◦ m) = [h1, h2] ◦ m .

([ , ] deﬁnes commutator in G. A and G are linear spaces on R).

The complex (Cq(G, A), δ) of cochains can be deﬁned in the following way. Let
Cq(G, A) be a space of skewsymmetric q-linear functions on G (q-cochains) which take
values in A (If q = 0, C0(G, A) = A). G-diﬀerential δ on {Cq} δ: Cq → Cq+1, δ2 = 0 is
deﬁned in the following way:

δ: C0 → C1
δ: C1 → C2

(δc)(h) = h ◦ c, (c ∈ C0 = A)

(δc)(h1, h2) = h1 ◦ c(h2) − h2 ◦ c(h1) − c([h1, h2]),

(A1.2)

and so on:

δ: Cq → Cq+1

(δc)(h1, . . . , hq+1) =

(−1)i+1hi ◦ c(h1, . . . , ˆhi . . . , hq+1)+

X1≤i≤q+1

X1≤i<j≤q+1

(−1)i+jc([hi, hj], h1, . . . , ˆhi, . . . , ˆhj . . . , hq+1)

( ˆhi means omitting of the variable hi)). The cohomologies H q(G, A) of the complex
({Cq}, δ) are called cohomologies of Lie algebra G with coeﬃcients in the module A. (See
in details for example [23].)

H q(G, A) =

ker δ: Cq → Cq+1

Im δ: Cq−1 → Cq

.

(cid:1)

If module A is R and G acts trivially on it: h ◦ λ = 0, Cq(G, R) is denoted by Cq(G)
and correspondingly H q(G, R) is denoted by H q(G). In this case cochains are constant
antisymmetrical tensors and G-diﬀerential δ is expressed only via structure constants {tn
ik}
of Lie algebra G.

H 0(G) = R, H 1(G) is deﬁned by the solutions of the equation cm

ikbm = 0 and it is

nothing but the space dual to the G/[G, G].

In a case if G is abelian H q(G) = Cq(G) = (∧G∗)q where G∗ is the linear space dual

to the linear space of G.

In a case if G is semisimple Lie algebra then H 1G=H 2G=0. This statement is valid
in a general case too. Very important Whitehead lemmas state that if G is semisimple Lie
algebra then H 1(G, A) = H 2(G, A) = 0 in the case if A is an arbitrary module which is
ﬁnite-dimensional vector space on R [23]

Appendix 2. Double complex and its spectral sequences.

Now we give a brief sketch on the topic how to apply spectral sequences technique for

calculations of cohomology of double complexes. (See for the details for example [23].)

Let E∗∗ = {Ep.q} (p, q = 0, 1, 2, ...) be a family of abelian groups (modules, vector
spaces) on which are deﬁned two diﬀerentials ∂1 and ∂2 which deﬁne complexes in rows
and in columns of E∗.∗ and which commute with each other:

∂1: Ep.q → Ep.q+1 , ∂2

1 = 0, ∂2: Ep.q → Ep+1.q , ∂2

2 = 0, ∂1∂2 = ∂2∂1 .

(A2.1)

{E∗∗, ∂1, ∂2} is called double complex.

( It is convenient to consider Ep.q for all integers p and q ﬁxing that Ep.q = 0 if p < 0

One can consider ”antidiagonals”: Dm = {Ep.m−p} (p = 0, 1, ..., m) which form com-

or q < 0.)

The rows and the columns complexes deﬁne the cohomologies H(∂1) and H(∂2) of

E∗∗.

One can consider the ﬁltration corresponding to the double complex {E∗.∗, ∂1, ∂2}

d0 = ∂1, → td0 = ∂2 ; d1[c]1 = [∂2c]1, → td1[c]1 = [∂1c]1 ,

and so on.

The relations between spaces {Ep.q

∞ } and {tEp.q

∞ } which express in diﬀerent ways the

cohomology H(Q) is one of the applications of the method described here.

Example. Let c = (c0, c1.c2) where c0 ∈ E0.2, c1 ∈ E1.1, c2 ∈ E2.0 be cocycle of the
diﬀerential Q: Q(c0, c1.c2) = 0 i.e. ∂1c0 = 0, ∂2c0 = −∂1c1, ∂2c1 = ∂1c2. To the leading
term c0 of this cocycle w.r.t. the ﬁltration (A2.4) corresponds the element [c0]∞ in E0.2
∞
which represents the cohomology class of the cocycle c in E0.2
∞ .

In the case if the equation (c0, c1.c2) + Q(b0, b1) = (0, c′

2) has a solution, i.e. the
leading term c0 of the cocycle c can be cancelled by changing of this cocycle on a cobound-
ary, then the element [c′
∞ represents the cohomology class of the cocycle c in
E1.1
∞ .

In the case if the equation (c0, c1.c2) + Q(b0, b1) = (0, 0, ˜c2) have a solution, i.e. the
leading term and next one both can be cancelled, by redeﬁnition on a coboundary, then
[˜c2]∞ ∈ E2.0

∞ represents the cohomology class of the cocycle c in E2.0
∞ .

To put correspondences between the cohomology class of the cocycle c and correspond-
ing elements from transposed spaces tE0.2
∞ , tE1.1
∞ we have to do the same, changing
∞
only the deﬁnition of leading terms, which we have to consider now w.r.t. the ﬁltration
(A2.14).

To the leading term c2 of this cocycle w.r.t. the ﬁltration (A2.14) corresponds the
element [c2]∞ in tE2.0

the case if the equation (c0, c1.c2) + Q(b0, b1) = (c′

term c0 of the cocycle c can be cancelled by changing of on a coboundary, then the element
[c′

(c0, c1.c2) + Q(b0, b1) = (˜c0, 0, 0) has a solution, then [˜c0] represents the cohomology class
of the cocycle c in tE0.2

Abstract:  A  family  of  coupled  nano-strips  with  varying  dimensions  is  fabricated  to 
obtain optical magnetic responses across the whole visible spectrum, from red to blue. 
The  proposed  approach  provides  one  with  a  universal  building  block  and  a  general 
for  various  practical 
recipe 
implementations. 

for  producing  controllable  optical  magnetism 

Light, as  an electromagnetic  wave with  both electric and  magnetic components, 
interacts  with  natural  materials  in  a  “one-handed”  manner.  Almost  all  conventional 
optical phenomena result from effects associated with the electric component of light, 
while the magnetic component barely plays a role. A partial explanation may be given 
within the regime of classical atomic electrodynamics, which shows that the effect of 
light  on  the  magnetic  polarizability  is  roughly  α2  (<  10-4)  weaker  than  its  electric 
counterpart,  with  α  being  the  fine  structure  constant  [1].  There  are  two  additional 
facts  that further prohibit any  natural optical magnetism. First, the selection rule  for 
non-relativistic  magnetic  dipole  transitions  determines  that  such  transitions  are 
allowed only between states with the same spatial parts of wavefunctions [2], and the 
energy  difference  between  such  two  states  is  much  smaller  than  the  usual  photon 
energy,  which  is  on  the  order  of  1  eV.  Second,  there  are  no  existing  magnetic 
monopoles, therefore one cannot produce a magnetic plasma as can be accomplished 
with  electrons  in metals  at optical frequencies. Consequently, as instructed by many 
textbook  writers,  including  Lev  Landau,  “there  is  certainly  no  meaning  in  using  the 
magnetic  susceptibility  from  optical  frequencies  onwards,  and  in  discussion  of  such 
phenomena we must put µ = 1 [3].” 

This situation has started to change in recent years since Pendry suggested using 
artificially  structured  “atoms”  of  a  metamaterial  to  mimic  magnetism  at  higher 
frequencies  [4].  Magnetic  responses  based  on  split-ring  resonators  (SRRs)  and  their 
analogues have  been  reported from C-band microwave  frequencies up to the optical 
wavelength  of 800 nm [5-9]*. At visible wavelengths, however, other structures like 
coupled nano-rods [10] or nano-strips [11-13] are preferred because there are intrinsic 
limits to scaling SRR sizes in order to exhibit a magnetic response in the optical range 
[14,15]**.  We  note  that  any  controllable  optical  magnetic  responses,  whether  they 
have  a  positive  or  negative  permeability,  are  important  for  various  implementations 
such as negative refraction [18-20], subwavelength waveguides and antennas [21,22], 
spectral  selective  filters  [23],  total  external  reflection  [24],  and  electromagnetic 
                                                        
* Here we use frequency-dispersive permittivity ε(ω) and permeability μ(ω) to characterize the electromagnetic 
response of a metamaterial. There is also an alternative description based on the generalized, spatially dispersive 
permittivity tensor
** Herein we do not consider the reported magnetism at the green light by coupled nano-pillars [16] because 
subsequent studies by two independent groups show that the claim is unjustified [17].

cloaking devices [25,26]. 
 
In this work we study the general resonant properties of magnetic metamaterials 
consisting of arrays of paired thin silver strips. The magnetism in such a structure has 
been discussed theoretically [11,12] and was recently demonstrated experimentally at 
the  very  red  end  of  the  visible  range  [27].  Here  we  extend  the  studies  to  obtain 
magnetic  responses  across  the  whole  visible  spectrum.  We  create  a  family  of 
paired-strip  samples  with  varying  geometries.  The  dependence  of  the  magnetic 
resonance wavelength on the geometric parameters is studied both experimentally and 
theoretically. 
Fig.  1a  shows  a  cross-sectional  schematic  of  the  coupled  nano-strip  samples.  A 
 
pair  of  thin  silver  strips  with  thickness  t  is  separated  by  an  alumina  spacer  with 
thickness d and refractive index nd ≈ 1.62. The whole sandwich stack is trapezoidally 
shaped with an average width of w and a bottom width of wb to reflect the reality of 
fabrication. The thickness of each silver layer and the alumina spacer are t = 35 nm 
and d = 40 nm, respectively. These parameters are optimized values based on spatial 
harmonic analysis. For different samples, we vary the width w of the strips to obtain 
optical  magnetic  resonances  at  a  set  of  wavelengths.  The  periodicity  p  changes 
accordingly, such that the overall coverage ratio (defined by the ratio of bottom width 
wb to the periodicity p) of each sample is roughly 50%. This ensures that the strengths 
of the magnetic resonances in different samples are comparable. 

The  samples  were  fabricated  by  electron  beam  lithography  (EBL)  techniques. 
Each sample is 160 μm × 160 μm in size. During electron beam deposition two thin 
alumina  layers  of  10  nm  were  added  to  the  top  and  bottom  of  the  Ag-Al2O3-Ag 
sandwich  stacks  for  fabrication  stability.  The  geometric  parameters  of  the  six 
magnetic  nano-strip  samples  are  given  in  Table  1.  All  six  samples  are  on  the  same 
substrate and were fabricated simultaneously to ensure a fair comparison. Fig. 1b and 
1c show the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and atomic force 
microscope (AFM) images of a typical paired nano-strip structure. 

It  has  been  demonstrated  that  nano-strip  structures  exhibit  both  magnetic  and 
electric resonances under TM illumination with the magnetic field polarized along the 
strips (see Fig. 1a for polarization definition). However, for TE polarization with the 
electric  field  aligned  with  the  strips,  the  structure  has  no  resonant  effects.  To 
qualitatively illustrate the resonance properties of the magnetic samples with different 
strip  widths,  we  took  microscopic  images  of  the  samples  for  two  orthogonal 
polarizations  using  an  advanced  optical  microscope  (Nikon  Eclipse  E1000)  with 
polarization  control.  The  microscopic  images  of  all  the  samples  within  the  same 
microscope view are shown in Fig. 2. For the resonant TM polarization case (Fig. 2a 
& 2c), we observe distinct colors in different samples in both transmission mode and 
reflection mode, which indicate the different resonant frequencies in different samples. 
For the non-resonant TE polarization, however, the colors are the same for all samples. 
In this case the samples act as diluted metals with a behavior similar to perfect metals: 
more  reflection  and  less  transmission  at  longer  wavelengths.  This  is  why  the 
non-resonant images appear blue in transmission mode (Fig. 2b) and red in reflection 
mode (Fig. 2d).

In  order  to  test  samples  with  distinct  resonance  properties,  we  measured  the 
 
broadband  transmission  and  reflection  spectra  of  the  nano-strip  samples  using  a 
custom  apparatus  with  polarization  control.  The  transmission  and  reflection  spectra 
were  normalized  to  a  bare  substrate  and  a  calibrated  silver  mirror,  respectively.  The 
collected spectra are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, we observe strong resonances from 
both transmission and reflection spectra for the TM polarization (Fig. 3a and 3c). For 
TE polarization, however, the spectra display a non-resonant wavelength dependence 
over a broad wavelength range (Fig. 3b and 3d). The slopes of the spectra in TE mode 
confirm our claim regarding diluted metal as discussed before and explain again why 
samples look blue in transmission mode (Fig. 2b) and red in reflection mode (Fig. 2d) 
for TE polarization. The six samples were fabricated with a range of strip widths from 
50  nm  (Sample  A)  to  127  nm  (Sample  F),  and  we  obtained  magnetic  resonances 
occurring from 491 nm to 754 nm, covering the majority of the visible spectrum. The 
positions  of  the  resonant  wavelengths  in  TM  mode  move  towards  the  blue  when 
decreasing  the  width  of  the  strips  from  Sample  F  to  Sample  A.  This  verifies  the 
scaling property of the magnetic structure of coupled nano-strips. 
The  spectra  for  TM  polarization  exhibit  multiple  resonances  and  several 
 
important  characteristic  wavelengths.  In  Fig.  4  we  plot  the  transmission,  reflection 
and  absorption  (including  diffractive  scattering)  spectra  of  a  typical  paired-strip 
sample  (Sample  E)  under  TM  polarization  with  three  characteristic  wavelengths 
marked  on  the  curves.  The  magnetic  resonance  around  λres,M  results  from  an 
anti-symmetric  current  flow  in  the  upper  and  lower  strips.  Therefore,  a  circular 
current is excited in the cross-section plane of the structure by the incident magnetic 
filed  and  gives  rise  to  a  magnetic  dipole  response.  This  magnetic  resonance  is  the 
major feature that we are pursuing in such a coupled nano-strips structure. In addition 
to the anti-symmetric  current mode, the strip pair also supports a  symmetric current 
mode  at  around λres,E,  which  results  in  an  electric  resonance.  These  two  resonances 
induce  the  two  local  minima  in  the  transmission  spectra  and  local  maxima  in 
reflection, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The absorption spectrum in Fig. 4 shows that extra 
absorption  occurs  near  the  two  resonance  wavelengths  λres,M  and  λres,E,  which  is 
natural  for  plasmonic  resonances  in  metal-dielectric  structures.  The  transmission 
spectrum also displays a sharp turn-back at a relatively shorter wavelength λdiff, which 
indicates the diffraction threshold of the grating-like structure. For a one dimensional 
grating with a periodicity p, a diffraction channel is created whenever the wavelength 

λ reaches below a diffraction threshold given by

λ =
,
diff
j

sn p j
/

,

where j is an integer 

and  ns  is  the  refractive  index  of  the  grating  substrate  (in  our  case,  ns  =  1.52  for  the 
glass substrate) [29]. When the wavelength λ falls below λdiff,j, strong distortion in the 
transmission  is  present,  which  is  usually  attributed  to  Wood’s  anomaly  [30].  In  our 
experiments  this  threshold  is  observed  for  Samples  D,  E  and  F,  whose  first-order 
threshold λdiff,1  is  within  the  detection  range  of λ  >  400  nm.  The  positions  of λdiff,1 
obtained  from  Fig.  3a  for  the  three  samples  agree  extremely  well  with  calculated 
values, exhibiting deviations of less than 1%. When a diffraction channel is opened at 
λ  <  λdiff,  substantial  optical  power  transfers  to  diffractive  scattering.  This  is  also

observed from the spectra in Fig. 4. 
 
In  addition  to  experimental  characterization,  the  properties  of  the  coupled-strip 
samples were investigated by numerical simulations with a commercial finite element 
package. The material properties of silver are taken from well-accepted experimental 
data  [31],  with  the  imaginary  part  of  the  permittivity  serving  as  an  adjustable 
parameter  to  reflect  the  actual  imperfection  of  the  metal  quality  in  EBL  fabrication. 
The detailed techniques in simulating such structures were published elsewhere [27]. 
The  transmission,  reflection  and  absorption  spectra  for  a  representative  sample 
(Sample E) are plotted in Fig. 4 along with the experimental data. All of the features 
observed in the experimental spectra are reproduced remarkably well in our numerical 
simulations. 
 
For  practical  designs  and  applications,  it  is  desirable  to  have  an  analytical 
expression for the relation between the magnetic resonance wavelength λres (identical 
to  λres,M  previously)  and  the  geometric  parameters  (w,  d,  t)  of  the  paired-strip 
structures.  Following  the  cavity  model  approach  discussed  in  [32],  we  find  that λres 
satisfies the following equation:

where ε′m is the real part of the metal permittivity. Due to the trapezoidal shape of the 
actual paired strips, the actual resonant wavelength is longer than that predicted by Eq. 
(1)  by  an  adjustment  constant  η.  That  is,  all λres  in  the  above  equation  should  be 
replaced by λres/η. 
Eq. (1) has no analytical solution and can only be solved numerically. To obtain 
 
an explicit solution, we use the first-order approximations for the square root and the 
hyperbolic tangent functions in Eq. (1). The permittivity ε′m of silver is given by the

silver. After some algebra we obtain the following approximate solution to Eq. (1):

This  solution  verifies  the  intuitive  conclusion  that  scaling  down  the  width  w  of  the 
strips results in a shorter resonant wavelength λres. Moreover, there is a less intuitive 
conclusion that reducing the thickness t of the metal strips tends to give λres a red-shift, 
which  has  been  observed  in  our  recent  experiments  [27].  Another  interesting 
observation from Eq. (1) is that, if the coupled strips are made of perfect metal with 
ε′m → −∞, Eq. (1) would require that the square root in the denominator equal zero. 
Therefore,  in  this  case  the  resonant  wavelength  λres  would  only  depend  on  one 
geometric parameter w and would be independent of the thickness t or separation d. 
This  claim  is  consistent  with  the  work  on  microwave  magnetic  media  with  paired

metal wires [33], where the resonant wavelength solely depends on the length of the 
wires.  Not  surprisingly,  for  a  perfect  metal  Eq.  (1)  gives  λres/nd  =  2w,  which  is  a 
natural solution for the basic mode of an electromagnetic cavity with a characteristic 
size of w. 
In  Fig.  5  we  plot  the  dependence  of  the  magnetic  resonance  wavelength λres  on 
 
the  average  width  w  of  the  trapezoidal-shape  paired  strip  samples  both  from 
experiments  and  analytical  approaches.  The  experimental  data  for  the  relationship 
between λres and w is taken from Fig. 3 (a,c). In the analytical approach of Eq. (1) and 
the approximate solution given by Eq. (2), the adjusting constant η is set to be 1.48. 
From Fig. 5 we can see that the results obtained from the Eq. (1) analytical method 
match the experimental data perfectly, and the approximate solution of Eq. (2) fits the 
experimental λres(w) relation remarkably well. Therefore, equations (1) and (2) can be 
used  as  a  general  recipe  for  producing  paired-strip  magnetic  metamaterials  at  any 
desired  optical  wavelengths.  Fig.  5  also  exhibits  negligible  saturation  due  to 
size-scaling,  which  indicates  that  such  a  structure  is  capable  of  producing  optical 
magnetism at even shorter wavelengths. 
As for the strength of the magnetic responses in those samples, we retrieved the 
 
effective permeability μ′ of each sample  around  the magnetic resonance  wavelength 
λres using numerical simulations with the homogenization technique [11,34]. For each 
sample,  the  material  properties  and  geometrical  parameters  used  in  the  retrieval 
procedure  guarantee  good  agreement  between  the  simulated  and  experimental 
broadband  spectra.  The  minimum  values  of  permeability  for  the  six  coupled-strips 
samples  are  shown  in  Fig.  5.  The  permeability  obtained  in  each  sample  is  distinct 
from unity, as it would be in conventional optical materials, and is found to be -1.6 in 
Sample F for dark-red light of 750 nm and 0.5 in Sample A at the blue wavelength of 
less  than  500nm.  We  note  that  for  all  the  samples  we  study  the  magnetic  resonance 
wavelength λres  is  at  least  5  times  larger  than  the  strip  width  w,  and  therefore  the 
coupled-strips  samples  can  indeed  be  regarded  as  two-dimensional  metamaterials  at 
the wavelengths of interest. 
In  summary,  we  have  demonstrated  a  universal  structure  based  on  coupled 
 
nano-strips  to  create  optical  magnetic  responses  across  the  whole  visible  spectrum. 
The resonant properties of a family of such structures with varying dimensions were 
studied  both  experimentally  and  numerically.  We  obtained  the  dependence  of  the 
magnetic resonance wavelength on the geometric parameters from both experimental 
observations  and  an  analytical  model,  which  provides  us  with  a  general  recipe  for 
designing such magnetic metamaterials at any desired optical frequency. Additionally, 
it is possible to tune the magnitude of the effective permeability μ′ by  changing the 
coverage  percentage  of  the  stripes.  Therefore,  to  a  large  extent,  the  coupled 
nano-strips structure can serve as a general building block for producing controllable 
optical magnetism for various practical implementations.

Abstract 

We compare 45 years of the reanalyses of NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF in terms of their 

representation of the mid-latitude winter atmospheric variability for the overlapping time 

frame 1957-2002. We adopt the classical approach of computing the Hayashi spectra of 

the 500 hPa geopotential height fields. Discrepancies are found especially in the first 15 

years  of  the  records  in  the  high-frequency-high  wavenumber  propagating  waves  and 

secondly on low frequency-low wavenumber standing waves. This implies that in the first 

period the two datasets have a different representation of the baroclinic available energy 

conversion  processes.  In  the  period  starting  from  1973  a  positive  impact  of  the  aircraft 

data on the Euro-Atlantic synoptic waves has been highlighted. Since in the first period 

the assimilated data are scarcer and of lower quality than later on, they provide a weaker 

constraint to the model dynamics. Therefore, the resulting discrepancies in the reanalysis 

products may be mainly attributed to differences in the models’ behavior.

1. Introduction 

Reanalysis  products  are  designed  to  obtain  global,  homogeneous  and  self-

consistent datasets of the atmospheric dynamics on the longest time scale allowed 

by  the  currently  available  instrumental  data  (Kistler  et  al.,  2001).  Recently,  the 

National  Center  for  Environmental  Prediction  (NCEP),  in  collaboration  with  the 

National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (Kistler et al., 2001), and the 

European  Center  for  Mid-Range  Weather  Forecast  (ECMWF)  (Simmons  and 

Gibson, 2000) have released re-analysed datasets for the time frames 1948-2004 

and  1957-2002,  respectively.  We  henceforth  refer  to  such  reanalyses  with  the 

names of NCEP and ERA 40, respectively.  

The re-analysed data have been used in a large variety of contexts, ranging from 

the  direct cross validation with independent observations (Josey, 2001; Renfew et 

al., 2002), to the study of specific aspects of  atmospheric dynamics (Annamalai et 

al., 1999; Hodges et al., 2003), to their usage as external input for the modeling of 

other components of the climate system (Harrison et al., 2002; Josey et al., 2002).  

Since they represent the best available homogeneous datasets for climate studies 

and  for  validation  of  climate  general  circulation  models  (GCMs),  it  is  of 

paramount  importance  to  assess  the  consistency  of  these  reanalyses  in  the 

representation of the variability of the atmosphere. Moreover, the reanalyses can 

presently  be  considered  long  enough  to  allow  for  the  detection  of  significant 

changes (trends) in the climate system. Any robust change in climate occurring on 

the  time  scales  of  a  few  decades  should  be  detectable  in  both  reanalyses.  The 

presence  of  an  overlapping  period  of  almost  five  decades  (1957-2002)  between 

the NCEP and ERA 40 datasets provides the baseline for intercomparison studies. 

In a sense, the assimilation processes employed to produce the two reanalyses are 

2 

to  be  envisioned  as  slightly  different  dynamically  consistent  interpolations  of 

similar  data.  In  this  view,  the  two  dataset  are  expected  to  provide  equivalent 

pictures  of  atmospheric  variability  and  changes.  However,  the  reanalyses  differ 

under  several  aspects.  The  assimilation  of data is  based upon the  use of slightly 

modified  version  of  the  numerical  model  employed  for  operational  weather 

forecast. The numerical models employed for producing NCEP and ERA 40 differ 

mainly in their resolution and in the parameterization of small scale physics. The 

resulting discrepancies between the two datasets should be taken into account in 

intercomparison  studies  (Caires  et  al.,  2004;  Ruiz-Barradas  et  al.,  2004;  Sterl, 

2004). Other inhomogeneities which are internal to each of the two dataset may 

arise from the unequal spatial and temporal density of instrumental data available 

during  the  period  covered  by  the  reanalyses  (Kistler  et  al.,  2001).    Most 

importantly,  the  assimilation  of  satellite  data  has  dramatically  improved  the 

quality of the reanalyses over the last three decades (Sturaro, 2003). Sterl (2004), 

analyzing monthly averaged variables, showed that the two reanalyses differ the 

most where less instrumental data are available (i.e. in the southern hemisphere).  

In  the  work  of  Sterl  (2004),  no  significant  difference  is  reported  in  the  northern 

hemisphere.  However,  large  inhomogeneities  exist  in  the  spatial  and  temporal 

distribution  of  data,  even  in  the  northern  hemisphere.  Therefore,  discrepancies 

may exist between the two reanalyses which are not captured within the low time 

resolution employed by Sterl (2004). 

In this work, we reconsider the differences observed in the mid-latitude northern 

hemispheric  winters  observed  in  the  NCEP  and  ERA  40  reanalyses  by  allowing 

for a time resolution of one day. 

3 

We use classical space time Fourier decomposition techniques to characterize the 

discrepancies  in  the  500hPa  geopotential  height  fields  provided  by  the  two 

reanalyses. 

Theoretical  and  observational  arguments  suggest  that  two  main  features  of  mid-

latitude northern hemispheric winter variability can be somewath unambiguously 

separated, both in terms of signal and physical processes (Benzi et al., 1986).  

The synoptic phenomena are traveling waves characterized by time scales of the 

order of 2-7 days and by spatial scales of the order of few thousands kilometers, 

and  can  be  associated  with  release  of  available  energy  driven  by  conventional 

baroclinic conversion (Blackmon, 1976; Speranza, 1983 Wallace et al, 1988). At 

lower  frequencies,  (period  of  10-40  days)  the  variability  is  mostly  due  to  the 

dynamics  of  long  stationary  waves,  locked  by  orography  (Charney  and  Straus, 

1980; Hansen and Sutera, 1983; Buzzi et al. 1984; Benzi et al., 1986).  

Building  upon  this  conceptual  framework,  we  first  measure  the  difference 

between  the  two  reanalyses  in  the  spectral  space  explored  by  means  of  the 

Hayashi decomposition (Hayashi, 1971, 1979; Pratt, 1976; Fraedrich and Bottger, 

1978)  into  standing  and  traveling  waves.  Then,  we  suggest  some  possible 

explanation based on actual observations of the 500hPa geopotential height field 

and of our knowledge of the assimilation process. 

This  study  is  also  a  preliminary  test  for  some  of  the  methodologies  and 

diagnostics  tools  which  will  be  employed  in  the  broader  context  of  a  sub-

diagnostic  project  presented  to  the  Program  for  Climate  Model  Diagnosis  and 

Intercomparison (PCMDI), sponsored by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 

Change Assessment Report 4 (IPCC-AR4).  

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  section  2  we  describe  the  data  and  how 

spectral  methods  can  be  used  to  select  the  latitudinal  band  relevant  for  mid-

4 

latitudes  atmospheric  variability.  In  section  3  we  show  the  results  of  Hayashi 

spectral  analysis  for  the  two  datasets  and  discuss  the  emerging  differences.  In 

section 4 we compare the variability of the 500hPa geopotential height fields for 

the two datasets before and after the onset of satellites observations. In section 5 

we present our conclusions and outlook on future studies.

2. Data and methods 

The  500hPa  geopotential  height  is  the  most  relevant  variable  descriptive  of  the 

large  scale  atmospheric  circulation  (Holton,  1992).  Therefore,  it  constitutes  a 

fundamental  benchmark  for  the  comparison  of  different  atmospheric  datasets  of 

climatological relevance. We use the freely available northern hemisphere 500hPa 

geopotential  height  reanalysis  provided  by  the  NCEP  and  ERA  40  datasets.  We 

consider the datasets for the overlapping time frame ranging from September 1st 

1957  to  August  31st  2002.  Both  reanalyses  are  publicly  released  with  spatial 

resolution  of  2.5°  x  2.5°,  with  a  resulting  effective  horizontal  grid  of  144  x  73 

points. The maximum time resolution is six hours. However, in order to focus on 

time  scales  longer  than  one  day,  for  both  reanalyses  we  consider  daily  data,  

obtained by arithmetically averaging the available 4 times daily data. 

Our  study  focuses  on  the  northern  hemisphere  mid-latitude  atmospheric  winter 

variability.  To  this  aim,  we  follow  Benzi  and  Speranza  (1989)  and  select  the 

December-January-February (DJF) data relative to the latitudinal belt 30°N-75°N 

where the bulk of the baroclinic and of the low frequency planetary waves activity 

is observed. We average day wise the geopotential field over such latitudinal belt 

in  order  to  derive  a  one  dimensional  longitudinal  field  representative  of  the 

atmospheric variability in the mid-latitudes. 

The variability of the one dimensional field  in terms of waves of different periods 

and wavelengths can be effectively described by means of the space-time Fourier 

decomposition  introduced  by  Hayashi  (1971,  1979).  By  computing  the  cross-

spectra and the coherence of the signal, such method allows for a separation of the 

eastward  and  westward  wave  propagating  components  from  the  standing 

component. In the Appendix we present a full account of this methodology.

3a. Climatological average  

Figures  1a-1d  show  the  various  components  of  the  45-winters  averages  of  the 

Hayashi  spectra  as  computed  from  the  NCEP  reanalysis  dataset.  The  spectra 

express  the  energy  density  of  the  wave  field  with  respect  to  frequency  and 

wavenumber  and  its  decomposition  into  standing  and  propagating  components.

, the energy spectrum  of the westward propagating waves. The overbar 

indicates the operation of averaging over the N=45 winters. Throughout the paper, 

the  indexes  T,  S,  E,  and  W  indicate  total,  standing  and  eastward/westward 

propagating  components,  respectively.  As  customary  in  literature,  the  Hayashi 

spectra  have  been  obtained  by  multiplying  the  energy  spectra  by 

⋅k

πω 2

,  in 

order to compensate for the non-constant density of points in a log-log plot (see 

Appendix A). 

A  large  portion  of  the  total  energy  is  concentrated  in  the  low  frequency  –  low 

wavenumber  domain,  and  can  be  related  mostly  to  standing  waves  and  to 

westward propagating waves, as can be deduced from figures 1b and 1d. The high 

frequency  -  small  wavelength  domain,  corresponding  mainly  to  synoptic 

disturbances,  contains  a  smaller  portion  of  the  total  energy,  and  is  essentially 

related to eastward propagating waves. The fact that eastward propagating waves 

are  essentially  characterized  by  short  wavelength  and  that  long  wavelengths 

7 

characterize  westward  propagating  waves  is  consistent  with  the  Rossby  waves 

picture. Accordingly, in figure 1c we observe that it is possible to recognize the 

frame  of  a  monotonic  dispersion  relation 

( )kωω=

  for  eastward  propagating 

waves. Instead, in figure 1d the appearance of a dispersion relation for westward 

propagating waves is unclear. These results have a good agreement with the past 

analyses performed along the same lines (Fraedrich and Bottger, 1978; Speranza, 

A first insight of the discrepancies between the two reanalyses can be gained by 

considering  the  difference  between  the  two  mean  Hayashi  spectra,  portrayed  in 

1983). 

figures 2a-2d. 

When considering the difference of the two total energy spectra (figure 2a), major 

discrepancies  can  be  observed  in  the  high-frequency  range,  corresponding  to 

synoptic, eastward propagating disturbances. This feature is confirmed in Fig. 2c 

where  a  significant  discrepancy  is  observed  in  this  component  of  the  Hayashi 

decomposition.  Instead,  no  significant  difference  is  found  in  the  westward 

propagating signal (figure 2d). 

When  considering  the  difference  spectrum  of  the  standing  waves  energy  (figure 

2b),  we  observe  that  the  most  significant  contribution  comes  from  the  low 

frequency-low  wavenumber  sector.  In  particular,  large  differences  are  observed 

for wavenumbers ranging from 3 to 5, and for periods longer than 20 days. In this 

domain  we  do  not  observe  large  discrepancies  for  the  total  energy  spectra.  This 

implies that the two datasets should differ in the repartition of the energy between 

standing and traveling waves. 

Such disagreements are quite impressive because the Hayashi spectra have been 

averaged  over  the  45  winters,  thus  proving  that  the  climatology  of  the  winter 

atmospheric variability of the two datasets is not fully equivalent.

3b. Interannual variability  

In  this  paragraph  we  inspect  the  temporal  behavior  of  the  previously  observed 

discrepancies  by  considering  specific  spectral  subdomains.  We  introduce  the

features.

eastward/westward propagating components (figure 3), reveal a systematic bias in 

the  period  1958-1972,  with  a  major  contribution  from  the  eastward  propagating 

component. The mean difference in the following period is negligible.  

For  various  choices  of  the  spectral  sub-domain  Ω ,  the  comparison  of  the

identifying 

differences  in  the  capability  of  the  two  reanalyses  in  describing  processes 

occurring  on  a  given  spatial  and  temporal  domain  and  pertaining  to  different 

physical  processes.  In  table  2  we  propose  a  clear-cut  division  of  the  waves  into 

four categories, on the basis of the definition of  Ω . The four categories are well-

separated  and  comprehend  most  of  the  wave  energy  of  the  atmosphere.  As  a 

consequence of what shown in figures 1a-1d, we have that by computing 

)ΩjE
(

 

for the spectral sub-domains defined in table 2, we obtain that most of the energy 

has to be attributed to the LFLW and HFHW waves. The absolute values of the 

total  energy  content  for  each  spectral  subdomain  are  not  reported.  Instead,  in 

figure 4a-b we plot the corresponding difference time series for the sub-domains 

LFLW  and  HFHW.  The  other  sub-domains  do  not  show  significant  differences. 

We observe that the HFHW component (figure 4b) has a very large ratio between 

the bias recorded in the first 15 years and the variability of the signal. The LFLW 

term (figure 4a) also seems to have a bias in the first period, but of the same order 

10 

of  magnitude  of  the  overall  interannual  variability.  The  systematic  differences 

observed  for  the  components  HFHW  and  LFLW  before  1973  correspond  to 

discrepancies of about 8% and 3% respectively, relative to the corresponding total 

energy content.

4.  Differences  of  the  geopotential  height  fields 

before and after 1973 

 

In  section  3  we  have  examined  the  discrepancies  between  the  two  reanalyses 

emerging  from  a  synthetic  description  of  the  activity  of  planetary  and  synoptic 

waves. We now proceed by analysing the spatial distribution of the difference in 

atmospheric variability reproduced by NCEP and ERA40 reanalysis. 

In the previous section, a systematic bias was observed during the first 15 years of 

the analysis. Therefore, we now divide the whole dataset into two periods, before 

and after 1973. A preliminary comment is the concomitance of the date with the 

use of the first meteorological information from satellites and aircraft data, both 

assimilated 

in 

the 

reanalysis 

models 

(see 

http://www.ecmwf.int/research/era/Data_Services/section3.html). 

In  figures  5a-d  we  plot  the  total  variability  for  the  NCEP  data  for  the  periods 

1958-72  (Fig.  5a)  and  1973-2002  (Fig.  5b),  and  the  corresponding  differences 

with the same data for the ERA40 reanalysis (Figs. 5c-5d, respectively). The two 

plots of the NCEP variance show that the atmospheric variability maximizes over 

the  oceanic  basins  (Blackmon,  1976).  The  main  differences  occur  over  these 

regions  for  the  whole  period  covered  by  the reanalyses, thus suggesting that the 

representation  of  small  scale  features  may  be  at  the  core  of  a  systematic  bias 

between  the  two  reanalyses.  In  the  Atlantic  sector  the  two  reanalysis  differ 

strongly in the earlier period, while in the second period the accordance becomes 

stricter. The relative differences in the total variability for the first period over the 

Pacific  and  Atlantic  regions  are  10%  and  3%  respectively.  We  note  also  a 

12 

significant discrepancy over the Okhostsk Sea, where ERA40 has more variability 

than NCEP (first period relative difference of the order of 10%).

The spatial pattern of the high frequency (HF) variability (

feature of the synoptic disturbances, concentrated downstream of the jet maxima 

in  storm-track  regions  (Blackmon  et  al.,  1977,  Speranza,  1983,  Wallace  et  al., 

1988). In the first period the ERA40 has more variability both over the Pacific and 

the Atlantic sectors; the relative differences are of the order of 10%, with peaks of 

about 20% over the Pacific on the central and exit area of the storm-track regions. 

The difference pattern of the Atlantic sector entails the whole region between the 

Hudson Bay and the Mediterranean basin. This latter difference disappears in the 

second  period,  while  the  Pacific  discrepancy  reduces  to  a  smaller  area  on  the 

eastern part of the basin. We emphasize that the discrepancies observed in the HF 

component cannot be explained by a corresponding change in the jet stream where 

the baroclinic waves grow (figure not shown).

5. Discussion and conclusions 

The NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses have been compared for the overlapping period 

1957-2002.  Differences  in  the  description  of  the  northern  hemispheric  winters 

have  been  quantitatively  estimated  by  employing  the  space-time  Fourier 

decomposition  introduced  by  Hayashi  (1971,  1979).  A  few  remarks  should  be 

made about the limits of the methodology employed in this work. By computing 

the  cross-spectra  and  the  coherence  of  the  signal,  the  Hayashi  decomposition 

allows for the discrimination of the propagating and standing components of the 

wavy  patterns  living  on  a  given  latitudinal  circle  or  latitudinal  belt.  Therefore, 

Hayashi  spectra  can    capture  only  fundamentally  one-dimensional  features. 

Instead,  the  two-dimensional  dynamics  of  synoptic  systems  on  the  sphere  have 

considerable impact on the evolution of features that are tangent or that cross the 

latitudinal  belt  considered  for  this  work.  The  presence  of  such  features  leaves 

spurious traces in the spectra considered in section 3. A second limit of Hayashi 

spectra  is  that  they  necessarily  describe  features  that  have  a  periodic  extension 

over  the  whole  latitudinal  circle.  Instead,  important  tropospheric  features  in  the 

high frequency subdomain, originate and decay at specific geographical location 

(Tibaldi and Molteni, 1990). Nevertheless, Hayashi spectra have proved useful in 

identifying some of the major biases between the two considered reanalyses. 

We have focused on two main regions (HF and LF) of the total spectrum, where 

reasonably well distinguishable processes are thought to affect the dynamics.  

Our  results  show  that,  considering  the  HF  and  LF  spectral  features  of  the 

atmosphere, disagreements between the two reanalyses can be found in the period 

prior  to  1973.  In  particular,  the  HF  spectral  component  shows  a  sudden 

improvement of the bias between the first and the second period. Instead, in the 

14 

low-frequency spectral region, it is more difficult to identify a similar transition. 

In  the  high-frequency  domain,  the  improvement  is  observe  mainly  over  the 

Atlantic basin, while in the Pacific basin differences in the variability  described 

by the two reanalyses  remain approximately constant before and after 1973. 

The coverage of the Northern Hemisphere by radiosondes, dominant over the land 

regions,  is  relatively  good  and,  to  a  large  extent,  uniform  throughout  the  period 

1958-1973  and  further  (Uppala  et  al.,  2004).  Therefore,  the  main  discrepancies 

between the two reanalysis in the early period should be due to other data source.. 

The analysis performed by Bengtsson et al. (2004) highlights the positive impact 

of the radiosondes data over the land and of the satellite data over the ocean. Our 

work confirms this behavior in the reanalysis and suggests also a relevant positive 

impact of the aircraft data, introduced in the data assimilation process in 1973. In 

fact  the  main  improvement  in  the  HF  component  of  the  Hayashi  spectra  can  be 

geographically located over the Atlantic Ocean (see figure 6), where the aircraft 

data  are  mainly  available.  Besides,  over  the  Pacific  Ocean  basin,  where  the 

additional  data  are  mainly  from  satellites,  a  weaker  improvement  is  observed  in 

the  atmospheric  baroclinic  waves  description  .  These  results  suggest  a  caveat  in 

using the reanalysis data for the analysis of the low and high frequency variability 

and  trends  prior  to  1973.  The  investigation  performed  in  this  work  provides  us 

some confidence level to use the reanalyses to validate the 500 hPa geopotential 

height variability in climate models. 

Thereby,  our  results  agree  with  the  findings  of  Hodges  et  al.  (2003)  and 

Bengtsson  et  al.  (2004)  that  when  considering  the  analyzed  fields  prior  to  1979 

caution  should  be  used  because  the  analyses  can  be  influenced  by  the  model 

deficiencies.  

15 

It remains to understand why the two models have different behaviors, both in the 

HF and LF components , in the first period where data available are scarcer.  The 

possibility  of  verifying  the  actual  relevance  of  our  interpretation  is  out  of  our 

reach  since  we  can  not  re-run  portions  of  the  assimilation  processes  for  both 

reanalyses and check for consistency. However, we suggest some possible causes 

of the observed discrepancies. 

Dynamically, the simultaneous occurrence of significant discrepancies in both the 

HF  and  LF  spectral  sub-domains  may  have  two  fundamentally  different 

interpretations.  If  the  two  spectral  subdomains  were  dynamically  independent, 

then the two reanalysis procedures should differ both in the treatment of physical 

processes which are responsible for LF variability and for processes related to the 

development  of  synoptic  disturbances.  However,  robust  arguments  about  energy 

cascades  in  geostrophic  turbulence,  suggest  that  energy  can  be  transferred  from 

high  to  low-frequency.  In  this  case,  a  difference  observed  in  the  standing 

component  could  be  attributed  to  the  transfer  of  energy  from  smaller  to  larger 

scale. (Savijarvi, 1978; Weeks et al., 1997). In support to the latter argument, we 

found  that  a  strong  bias  in  the  HFHW  sub-domain  exist  in  the  first  period  and 

corresponds to a noticeable bias in the LFLW. 

After  1973,  when  the  bias  in  the  HFHW  disappears,  the  bias  in  the  LFLW  also 

disappears. However, the variability of the interannual discrepancies in the LFLW 

sub-domain, remains larger than the initial bias itself, indicating that a mechanism 

during all the reanalysis period acts to produce this error. 

Such  discrepancies  in  the  description  of  basic  physical  processes  may  be 

attributed most likely to one or both of the following characteristics of the models 

used for the reanalyses. 

16 

The first is the resolution of the two models. The two models used for ERA40 and 

NCEP  reanalyses  use  spectral  methods  in  the  horizontal  and  finite  difference 

methods  in  the  vertical.  They  mainly  differ  in  the  level  of  the  truncation  in  the 

horizontal (T63 for NCEP, T159 for ERA40) and in the number of vertical levels 

(28 for NCEP, 60 for ERA40). The truncation level can influence the enstrophy 

inverse cascade, and it can also affect the horizontal convergence of momentum, 

which  in  turn  alters  the  horizontal  wind  shear  and  controls  the  growth  of  the 

baroclinically unstable eddies. Moreover, the vertical resolution should impact the 

meridional  and  vertical  heat  fluxes  associated  to  baroclinic  perturbations  that 

modify the thermal vertical structure of the atmosphere in the midlatitudes (Barry 

et al., 2000; Dell’Aquila, 2004).  

Another aspect of the reanalyses ,which has been demonstrated to affect the low 

frequency  variability  ,is  the  envelope  orography,  i.e.  subgrid-scale  orography 

parameterization  (Wallace  et  al.,  1983;  Tibaldi  1986).  ERA40  uses  an  envelope 

orography,  whereas  NCEP  has  a  mean  orography.  For  this  parameterization  the 

smaller  scales  of  the  orography    directly  affect  the  zonal  flow  (Tibaldi,  1986). 

This  fact  could  explain  the  variability  of  the  interannual  discrepancies  in  the 

LFLW sub-domain in the period after 1973.

Appendix: Space-time spectral analysis 

The  space-time  spectral  analysis,  introduced  by  Hayashi  (1971),  provides 

information about the direction or speed at which the eddies move. 

This  information  may  be  obtained  by,  firstly,  Fourier-analysing  the  spatial  field 

and then computing the time-power spectrum of each spatial Fourier component. 

The difficulty here lies in the fact that straightforward space-time decomposition 

will not distinguish between standing and traveling waves: a standing wave will 

give  two  spectral  peaks  corresponding  to  traveling  waves  moving  eastward  and 

westward  at  the  same  speed  and  the  same  phase.  The  problem  can  only  be 

circumvented  by  making  assumptions  regarding  the  nature  of  the  wave.  For 

instance, we may assume complete coherence between the eastward and westward 

components of standing waves and attribute the incoherent part of the spectrum to 

real traveling waves (Pratt, 1976, Fraedrich and Bottger, 1978; Hayashi,1979). 

In this formulation,  for each winter considered, the energy spectrum

at  a  zonal  wavenumber  k  and  temporal  frequency  ω  for  the  eastward    and

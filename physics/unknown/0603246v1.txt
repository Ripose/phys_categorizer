Abstract 

 

 

 

 

 

An  analytic  expansion  of  the  exact  one-electron  momentum  density  of  the  Hooke’s 

atom is derived for the case k = ¼. Electron correlation is shown to have opposite effects on 

the momentum density, compared with the Moshinsky’s atom, but is qualitatively similar to 

classical two-electron atomic systems at large momenta. 

 
Keywords: Momentum space, Hooke’s atom, Moshinsky’s atom, two-electron atoms, momentum density.

1.  Introduction and definitions 

The  Hooke’s  atom  is  a  system  of  two  electrons  repelling  classically  while 

harmonically trapped about a nucleus, for which an exact ground-state wave function can be 

written in closed-form [1]. This model atom is therefore often used in literature to investigate 

exact electron distributions [2,3,4,5,6]. So far, the one-electron momentum properties of this 

model system have however not drawn much attention.  

The  one-electron  momentum  density  n(p)  is  related  to  fundamental  functions,  which 

are recalled now [7]. First, the one-electron reduced density-matrix (or 1RDM) derived from a 

N-electron wave function y  is usually written as [8]:

Integrating eq. (1) over spin variables leads to a “spinless” 1RDM

2.  Exact  vs.  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  momentum  densities  of  the 

Moshinsky’s and Hooke’s atom 

The ground-state singlet HF momentum density of a two-particle system is determined 

by  the  unique  momentum  space  orbital 

HFc   as 

HFn

(cid:6)

p

(cid:5)

c=

HF

(cid:6)

p

(cid:5)

  (see  for  instance  ref. 

2

[7]). Such an expression reflects the fact that a determinantal 1RDM can be written as a finite 

sum of orbital products, e.g. only one in the present case. In contrast, the exact 1RDM of a 

correlated system is known to involve more orbital products, possibly an infinite sum thereof, 

reflecting the fact that r and r’ are not separable anymore [8]. 

2.1 Moshinsky’s atom 

This point can be easily understood through a simple example: the Moshinsky’s atom, 

in  which  two  fermions  are  bounded  from  a  harmonic  potential

. Such a system is exactly solvable [9], 

allowing for the calculation of exact closed-form densities [8], and thus for the comparison of 

exact and HF density matrices, respectively

Notice that one-particle densities derived from the 1RDMs above will differ from each 

other  by  a  simple  scale  factor.  Yet,  as  a  „  b (unless  l  =  0),  the  exponent  in 1r   is  not 

proportional to 

2
r +

2

'r

, so that the exact

1r  can not be rewritten as a single orbital product, in 

contrast with 

HF(cid:1)1r . Rather, it may be expanded as an infinite sum of orbital products, e.g. by 

developing 

e

1
- 2

(
)
(cid:7)rrba-

(cid:3)

 and rearranging expanded terms as products of orbitals.   

The  HF  kinetic  energies  is  0.612372  atomic  units  (which  are  assumed  throughout), 

that  is,  in  error  of  +3.5%,  with  respect  to  the  exact  kinetic  energy  (0.591506).  Here,  virial 

theorem  implies  the  exact  kinetic  energy  of  the  Moshinsky’s  atom  in  its  ground  state  to  be 

minimal, by virtue of the relation 

½ E = T = Uext + Uee, 

where Uext is the potential energy of electrons in the external harmonic force field while Uee is 

the electron-electron repulsion energy. Consistently, the difference

 becomes 

negative at large momenta for the Moshinsky’s atom, see figure 1. 

2.2 Hooke’s atom 

In  the  Hooke’s  atom,  the  electrons  are  still  bounded  from  the  harmonic  potential

,  which 

asymptotic form is not easily recovered by the expansion of eq. (9).  

Accordingly, truncating eq. (9) at any order m = mmax leads to some inaccuracy of the 

gaussian expansion at large values of p12. For instance, stopping the expansion at mmax = 4, 16, 

64 and 256 leads to relative errors of about 1.00, 0.10, 0.01 and 0.001% on the kinetic energy, 

respectively (the converged value being found to be 0.664417 by numerical integration). This 

slow  convergence  of  n(p)  is  somehow  a  consequence  of  the  inter-electron  potential 

/1 r , 
12

which  reflects  in  the  exact  wave  function,  and  in  turn  makes  r  and  r’  non-separable  in  the 

1RDM.  

The  HF  momentum  density  can  be  obtained  by  expanding  the  HF  orbital  over 

harmonic-oscillator eigenfunctions, following ref. [3] (the five first eigenfunctions were used 

in  the  present  case).  Hence,  using  the  converged  value  T  =  0.664417  for  the  exact  kinetic 

energy,  the  difference  with  respect  to  the  HF  value  amounts  to  0.031883  (by  numerical 

integration). The correlation kinetic energy is thus of the same order of magnitude as that of 

the helium atom (about 0.04204). 

The  momentum  moments  of  Hooke’s  atom  obtained  thanks  to  the  expanded 

momentum density of eq. (10) are reported in table 2 (accurate to the last digit) together with 

those of H- and He atomic systems.  

In  reference  to  figures  1  and  2,  while  the  momentum  densities  look  pretty  much  the 

same  for  either  the  Moshinsky’s  or  Hooke’s  atom,  the  differences  between  exact  and  HF 

curves  show  opposite  behaviors.  In  the  Hooke’s  case  (figure  2),  nHF(p)  overestimates  the 

exact  number  of  electrons  of  low  momenta,  consistently  with  the  kinetic  energies  and  other 

momentum moments reported in table 2. This is further consistent with the implications that 

6 

the virial theorem has in the present case. Indeed, as discussed in ref. [4,5], the virial theorem 

implies here  

T = Uext – ½ Uee. 

Thus, since correlation tends to substantially decrease Uee, while not affecting too much Uext, 

the  exact  kinetic  energy  T  must  therefore  be  greater  than  the  HF  one.  Accordingly,  one 

expects the difference 

)pn
(

- 

nHF

(

)p

 to be positive at high momenta (see figure 3 and table 

2), owing to the momentum induced by the electrons repelling. Such a phenomenon is in fact 

rather  systematic  for  coulombic  systems  of  two  electrons  (see  e.g.  ref.  [11,12])  or  even  for 

molecular systems [13,14].

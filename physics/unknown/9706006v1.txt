Abstract

The forms of the invariant primitive tensors for the simple Lie algebras Al, Bl, Cl
and Dl are investigated. A new family of symmetric invariant tensors is introduced
using the non-trivial cocycles for the Lie algebra cohomology. For the Al algebra it
is explicitly shown that the generic forms of these tensors become zero except for the
l primitive ones and that they give rise to the l primitive Casimir operators. Some
recurrence and duality relations are given for the Lie algebra cocycles. Tables for
the 3- and 5-cocycles for su(3) and su(4) are also provided. Finally, new relations
involving the d and f su(n) tensors are given.

We devote this paper to a systematic study of the symmetric and skewsymmetric primitive
invariant tensors that may be constructed on a compact simple Lie algebra
. The sym-
; the skewsymmetric ones determine
metric invariant tensors give rise to the Casimirs of
the non-trivial cocycles for the Lie algebra cohomology (see e.g.
It is well known
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] that there are l such invariant symmetric primitive polynomials of
order mi (i = 1, . . . , l = rank of
), which determine l independent primitive Casimir op-
erators of the same order, as well as l skewsymmetric invariant primitive tensors Ω(2mi−1)
of order (2mi −
1). The latter determine the non-trivial cocycles for the Lie algebra coho-
mology, their order being related to the topological properties of the associated compact
group manifold G which, from the point of view of the real homology, behaves as products
of l S(2mi−1) spheres [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. The lowest examples of these ten-
sors/polynomials (m1 = 2) are the Killing tensor (which is a multiple of δij for a compact
algebra), the quadratic Casimir operator and the fully skewsymmetric structure constants
(see Example 3.1 below).

G

The simplest way of obtaining an invariant symmetric tensor k(r) on

The study of the invariant primitive tensors on
(and especially in the most interesting
G
= su(n)) is not only mathematically relevant; their properties determine essential
case
aspects of the physical theories based on the associated group G. These range from the
form of the vertices in Feynman diagrams to the presence or absence of non-abelian anoma-
lies in gauge theories (see in this last respect the articles in [19] and references therein; see
also [20]). They are also relevant in other instances as e.g., in (higher order) Yang-Mills
-symmetry
duality problems [21], WZWN terms (see, e.g. [22] and references therein),
W
in conformal ﬁeld theory [23], the construction of eﬀective actions [24], etc.
It is then
convenient to have an explicit expression for the primitive tensors of the diﬀerent orders
as well as a convenient basis for the vector spaces of the invariant tensors of a given order.
is by computing
the trace of the symmetrised product of r generators. This symmetric trace (which may
give a zero result depending on r and on the speciﬁc algebra
being considered) will
not vanish, however, for arbitrary r. As a result, the trace will give rise to arbitrarily
higher order tensors that cannot be primitive and independent of those of lower order mi
(i = 1, . . . , l), and the same will apply to the Casimir operators constructed from them.
This indicates that it is convenient to introduce a new family of tensors which is free of this
problem. We shall do this in Sec. 3 by introducing a new family of symmetric invariant
1)-cocycles Ω(2mi−1), (i = 1, . . . , l). These tensors
tensors t(mi) from the l primitive (2mi −
will turn out to be ‘orthogonal’ in a precise sense (see Lemma 3.3). We shall also show
how the l primitive Casimirs may be equivalently obtained from the t(mi) tensors or from
the cocycles Ω(2mi−1).

For the su(n) algebras many results and techniques are already available. For instance,
we can construct recursively [25] (see also [26, 4]) the so-called d-family of symmetric
invariant tensors of order m starting from the symmetric dijk (for su(n), n > 2) and
symmetrising the result d(i1...im). This family (see Sec. 6.1) has a status like the k family
i.e., for n ﬁxed and m large enough the d(m) tensors may be expressed as linear combinations
of products of lower order ones. For ﬁxed m and n (in su(n)) suﬃciently large (in fact, for
(m) of invariant symmetric
n
tensors of order m, and via known identities for the d(m), how this basis reduces when
n < m. We use these properties in our discussion of the t(mi) family. In particular we
see that a formal attempt to construct t-tensors of higher rank than is allowed from their
deﬁnition necessarily yields an identically vanishing result (Sec.6.2). In proving this, we
have needed to extend the set of identities for the d and f su(n) tensors in the literature
known to us.

The paper is organised as follows. After a short general discussion of the invariance
properties of tensors and Casimir operators on
1)-
cocycles is given in Sec.3, where the t(mi) family of invariant symmetric tensors is intro-
duced. Sec.4 illustrates these general considerations for the su(3) and su(4) algebras.
Sec.5 provides a general discussion of the primitivity of the invariant symmetric tensors
and Casimir operators for the four inﬁnite series Al, Bl, Cl and Dl and shows explicitly,
if not systematically, how a given primitive polynomial becomes algebraically dependent
is reduced suﬃciently. Due to the special

relevance of the su(n) algebras, Sec.6 is devoted to illustrate these ideas for the Al case
and, in particular, the usefulness of the t(mi) family of tensors. Sec.7 discusses, again for
the four inﬁnite series, the properties of the (2mi −
1)-cocycles. The topological properties
underlying the compact group manifolds provide a clue to establish, using the Hodge star
operator, duality properties for the Lie algebra cocycles. This is done in Sec.8, and some
∗
of the formulae are illustrated by using the explicit results in Sec.4. Finally an Appendix
develops some properties of the d and f su(n) tensors for arbitrary n, and collects a number
of new expressions which are needed for the derivation of crucial results in the main text.

It is well known [2, 3, 6, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9] that a simple algebra of rank l has l independent
(primitive) Casimir-Racah operators of order m1, . . . , ml, the ﬁrst of them given by the
standard Casimir [27] operator KijX iX j obtained from the Killing tensor (m1 = 2) Thus,
there must be (Cayley-Hamilton) relations among the invariant tensors obtained from (2.3)
for m > ml or otherwise one would obtain an arbitrary number of primitive Casimirs. We
shall study this problem in Sec.5 and apply our results to the su(n) algebras in Sec.6.

where we have used the invariance of h in the second equality, the Jacobi identity in the

By deﬁnition, primitive tensors are not the product of lower order tensors, but may contain
non-primitive terms. It follows from Corollary 3.1 that only the primitive term in k con-
tributes to the cocycle (3.6). As a result, diﬀerent families of symmetric tensors diﬀering
in non-primitive terms lead to proportional cocycles. Thus, and as far as the construction
of the cocycles is concerned, we may use any family h(m) of symmetric invariant primitive
tensors in (3.6), not necessarily that given by (2.3); for instance, for su(n) we may use the
d family of Sec 6.1. We shall use (3.6) with the deﬁnition (2.3) unless otherwise indicated.
We introduce now a new type of symmetric invariant polynomials by using the cocycles.

Their interest will be made explicit in Sec. 6.

where we have used the invariance (3.10) of Ω(2m−1) in the second equality, the Jacobi
identity in the third and the skewsymmetry of Ω(2m−1) in the fourth. Thus t is invariant

Since ki1i2 ∝

δi1i2, the tracelessness of (3.15) may be seen as ti1...im having zero con-
traction with kij. This extends to the full contractions with all higher order symmetric
invariant tensors by means of the following

Let ti1...im be the symmetric invariant polynomial given by (3.15). Then

considered before (see, e.g., [31, 26, 25]) but to our knowledge there is no uniﬁed treatment
available in the literature for the four simple inﬁnite series.

Let us start by recalling the case of su(n) [31] and consider

α1...αn+1(Ti1)α1
ǫβ1...βn+1

(Tin+1)αn+1

·βn+1 = 0

(5.1)

This expression is symmetric in the generator indices i1 . . . in+1 and is obviously zero since
the matrix representation indices α, β range from 1 to n. Using (3.5), it follows that the
above expression is a sum of (n+1)!-terms which may be grouped in classes, each class being
a sum of terms all involving a product of the same number ν1, . . . , νn+1 of products of traces
of products of 1, . . . , n+1 matrices respectively, where 1
ν2+. . .+(n+1)νn+1 = (n+1).
In other words, the diﬀerent types of products appearing in (3.5) are characterised by the
partitions of (n + 1) elements i.e. by the Young patterns (see, e.g., [32]) associated with
Sn+1,

ν1+2

·

·

[(n + 1)νn+1, nνn, . . . , 2ν2, 1ν1]

(5.2)

(obviously, νn+1 = 1 or 0). All the elements of Sn+1 for a given pattern (a set of ﬁxed
integers ν1, . . . , νn+1) determine products of traces of matrices with the same grouping
pattern and, moreover, appear in (5.1) with the same sign (they correspond in Sn+1 to
the same conjugation class). The number of SN elements associated with a given Young
pattern is given by the 1844 Cauchy formula

and since they correspond to permutations σ

(5.4)

they all contribute to (5.1) with the same sign.

The mechanism which expresses the higher-order symmetric invariant polynomials in
terms of the primitive ones is now clear. A given Young pattern determines a speciﬁc
product of invariant symmetric tensors with the sign (5.4) and weighted by the factor (5.3).
Since one of the terms in the sum (5.1) corresponds to the partition ν1 = . . . = νN −1 =
0 , νN = 1, it follows that the invariant symmetric tensor of order m = n + 1 = l + 2 will
be expressed, through (5.1), in terms of the l tensors of order 2, 3, . . . , l + 1 and that only
these are primitive for n = l + 1.

We are thus lead to the following

Lemma 5.1 (Invariant symmetric polynomials on su(n))
There are l invariant polynomials of order 2, 3, . . . , l + 1; the others are not primitive, and
may be expressed in terms of products of them.

The simplest application is that di1i2i3 = 0 for su(2). For the next higher order we have

the following

symmetric tensor can be expressed in terms of the Killing second-order one. Using (4.2)

Lemma 5.2 (Generation of higher order invariant symmetric polynomials for Bl, Cl, Dl)
Let vi1i2i3i4 be the second lowest symmetric invariant polynomial for Bl, Cl, Dl. Then, the
higher order symmetric polynomials ki1...i2p may be written in terms of vi1i2i3i4 by means
of (5.12) and (5.10).

G

Let now

be Bl (Cl) and let Xi be a basis for Bl (Cl) given by (2l+1)- (2l)- dimensional
matrices. Then, since the symmetric trace of a product of an odd number of X’s is zero,
and any partition of an odd number of elements will always include a symmetric trace of
an odd number of X’s we have to consider an even product

Lemma 5.3 (Invariant symmetric polynomials for Bl, Cl)
The symmetric invariant polynomials for Bl, Cl given by (2.3) are all of even order m = 2k

This expression relates the eighth-order invariant symmetric polynomial with those of lower
degree.

The case of the even orthogonal Dl is diﬀerent because, in this case, there is an invariant
polynomial which is related to the square root of the determinant of an even dimensional
matrix (the Pfaﬃan).

Lemma 5.4 (Invariant symmetric polynomials for Dl)
The symmetric invariant polynomials for Dl given by (2.3) are of even order and primitive
for m = 2, 4 . . . , 2l

6 Invariant symmetric tensors for su(n): a detailed

study

The case of su(n) is specially important since SU(n)-invariant tensors appear in many
physical theories as e.g., QCD. The properties of the su(n)-algebra tensors have already
been discussed in [33, 29, 31, 26, 25] (and tables for the fijk and the dijk for su(n) up to
n=6 have been given in [30]), but we need to perform here a more complete and systematic
study. The case of the cocycles was already discussed in Sec.4. We consider now the
symmetric tensors, exhibiting in particular how the relations deﬁning them for general n
produce primitive tensors up to a given order ml and non-primitive ones when this order
is exceeded. To this aim, we shall use Lemma 3.3 and its Corollary 3.2.

6.1 d-tensors

We begin our study of totally symmetric tensors of arbitrary ranks for su(n) by considering
the d-tensor family [25] (see also [4]). For ranks r = 2 and 3 we have d(2)
ijk = dijk,
where the latter is the well-known totally symmetric and traceless su(n) tensor, which
exists for n

3. Higher order tensors are deﬁned recursively via

ij = δij, d(3)

i1...ir−1irir+1 = d(r)

r = 3, 4, . . .

i = 1, ..., (n2
3, the above tensors are not symmetric in all their indices, so
the required totally symmetric tensors are deﬁned from their symmetrisation which gives

1). For r

(6.1)

(6.2)

Due to the fact that dijk is already symmetric, (6.2) normally represents the sum of p < r!
distinct terms divided by p. The construction deﬁnes a family of symmetric invariant
tensors of order r.

We want to know the dimension and a basis for the vector space

(m) of invariant
symmetric tensors of a given order m (Corollary 3.2). For example, for n large enough

(i1i2i3i4i5)

d(i1i2i3δi4i5)

In fact, dim

(4) = 2, only for n

d(4)
(i1i2i3i4) =

d(i1i2i3δi4i5)

,

d(5)
(i1i2i3i4i5) =

d(i1i2i3δi4i5)

.

These results will serve as a check on some calculations done later. They are a consequence
of Corollary 3.2; eqs. (6.5) and (6.6) also follow from work in [25] and in [31], both of which
(4) and suggest possible bases to use for increasing r. The recursive
supply values for dim
procedure of [25] actually supplies more information, but the work in [31] is also useful,
providing direct access to results for each ﬁxed n.

V

One way to see that not all families of symmetric invariant tensors of a given order are

equally useful arises when one uses them to construct Casimir operators by (2.6)

C

(r) = d(r)

(i1...ir)X i1 . . . X ir

In principle this yields an arbitrary number of
2. But since su(n) has (n
Casimir operators, one of each order r
1) primitive Casimir
operators of order 2, 3, . . . , n, it must be possible to express those with order r > n in
terms of the primitive ones. It is well known how to do this for su(3), where (6.5), (6.7)

It is not possible in practice to treat such matters explicitly or even systematically for
arbitrarily large n, r. It is thus convenient to replace the family of symmetrised d-tensors
by a family for which no similar diﬃculties arise. This is achieved by using the t-tensors
introduced in Lemma 3.2 and taking advantage of their property (3.18).

(6.10)

6.2 t-tensors

Working within the t family, we can build from t(m) only one non-vanishing scalar quantity,

K (m)(n) = t(m) i1...imt(m)

i1...im ;

(6.11)

all other contractions are zero by Lemma 3.3. Since the standard su(n) Gell-Mann matrices
λi allow easy computation of the d-tensors, and a well-developed technology to operate
with them exists (which can be completed when necessary with additional relations, see
Appendix), we give the expressions of our t-tensors in terms of the d-tensors in Sec. 6.1.
From (3.8) we trivially obtain

Similarly, for m=3,4 eqs. (3.15), (3.6) give

These results exhibit the crucial property of the t-tensors. They are in one-to-one corre-
spondence with the Ω tensors and hence, as we discuss below, provide an ideal way (free
from problems associated with d-tensors noted above) to discuss Casimir operators. For
low n, for which only (2m
1 can be non-zero, the generic
results for t(m)-tensors (6.12)-(6.15) collapse according to (6.16)-(6.18), as they must when
m > n, to give vanishing tensors.

It is now plausible to conclude that the pattern persists for all su(n) algebras, and that
with the required modiﬁcations it remains true for other classical families.

For low rank groups, for which cocycles above a certain order cannot appear, the
corresponding possibly non-zero scalars K (m) that can be formed can be seen to vanish
identically, as expected since the t-tensors used to deﬁne them also do so.

6.4 Some technical remarks

The crucial results (6.14) and (6.15), which provide explicit expressions for the fourth
and ﬁfth-order invariant symmetric su(n)-tensors require, for their derivation, a series
of expressions involving properties of the f and d tensors of su(n) which at present are
not available in the literature. The same applies to the calculations (6.20)-(6.23) for the
canonical su(n) scalars K (n), on which we have based some generalisations. In addition to
early work [29] containing a modest amount of generic su(n) material, we have used [33]
which contains a wide class of identities for f and d tensors. To proceed further here, we
make use of the fact that an arbitrary symmetric SU(n)-invariant tensor may be expanded
(m) as explained in Subsec.6.1 (see also [25, 31] for low values of m).

7 Recurrence relations for primitive cocycles

Consider ﬁrst the case of su(n). In the deﬁning representation, the unit matrix and the
Ti’s span a basis for the space of hermitian n
n matrices. This means that, since the
symmetrised product of hermitian matrices is also a hermitian matrix, we can write

×

{

i1...imTσ + ˆki1...imI

i1...im and ˆki1...im are invariant symmetric polynomials (of order (m+ 1) and m) that
where ˜kσ
can be related to the k tensors deﬁned by (2.3). However, to give recurrence relations we
want to use here the invariant symmetric tensors d ([25]; see also [4]) deﬁned by eq. (6.1)6.
The d(m) polynomials are not traceless, and hence diﬀer from those of (3.15). Let
ij themselves provide a

us use them to deﬁne cocycles. Since the structure constants C k

Extending the procedure to an arbitrary Ω(2m−1) cocycle we now get the following

6Other expressions such as (2.3) could be used here, since the non-primitive parts in (2.3) do not

contribute to the cocycle deﬁnition due to Corollary 3.1.

7Note that, in the above examples, it is not necessary to introduce a ﬁve [seven] index ǫ tensor in the
r.h.s.; instead, skewsymmetry in i2i3i4 [i1...i6] will suﬃce in (7.2) [(7.5)] because d(ijk) = dijk [d(4)
(ijkl) =
d(4)
(ijk)l]. However, for the ﬁfth-order polynomial d(5)
ijklm we cannot use such a simpliﬁcation (although in the
symmetrisation there are fewer than 5! diﬀerent terms). In this case (and for higher order d-polynomials)
we need the complete (2m

1)-th order ǫ tensor, eq. (3.4), to remove the non-symmetric parts in (6.1).

8 Duality relations for skewsymmetric primitive ten-

sors

The interpretation of the primitive cocycles as closed forms on the group manifold of
a simple compact group G provides another intuitive way to obtain additional relations
among them. Consider the case of su(2). The identiﬁcation of the su(2)-three-cocycle with
S3 tells us that this form is (up to a constant)
the closed de Rham three-form on SU(2)
the volume form on the SU(2) group manifold. It is known [10, 11, 12, 13, 1, 14, 15, 16, 17]

(A.10)

Now we illustrate the method of derivation of the above results and perform a variety of
checks of their correctness. In the framework of Sec. 6, we set out from an expansion of
an arbitrary totally symmetric fourth-rank tensor in

(4) and write

TrF(aFbFcFd) = Ad(4)

V
(abcd) + Bδ(abδcd)

.

(A.11)

Contracting both sides with δab and dabe in turn and using results such as (A.2) allows us
easily to ﬁnd A = n/4, B = 2. Various checks on, e.g., (A.5) and its consequences now
exist. Firstly, in [33] we ﬁnd identities for contractions of (A.5), (A.7) and (A.10) with dace
and face. Performing such contractions explicitly on our expressions for these traces, we
ﬁnd total agreement for all SU(n). For the case of SU(3) a more elementary derivation
of, e.g. TrFaFbFcFd is available because additional identities for SU(3) D and F matrices
exist as described in [29]. One can thus get the n = 3 version of, e.g. TrF(aFbFcFd) without
using any assumptions about symmetric tensors. In particular, for SU(3), we have

TrF(aFbFcFd) =

δ(abδcd),

Analogously, from

TrD(aDbDcDd) = A′d(4)

(abcd) + B′δ(abδcd)

(A.15)

and contracting with δab and dabs we deduce that A′ = (n2

4)/n2.
Armed with the results (A.5) to (A.10) as well as those of (A.2), we can consider

32)/4n and B′ = 2(n2

ﬁve-fold traces. Thus we postulate (see (6.4))

TrD(aDbDcDdDe) = Ad(5)

(abcde) + Bδ(abdcde)

,

(A.16)

Contracting this with δab and dabf in turn gives three linear equations for the coeﬃcients
A and B; in the latter construction equating coeﬃcients of d(4)
(cdef ) and δ(cdδe)f =

(cde)f = d(4)

δ(cdδef ) has actually given rise to two equations. These three equations are consistent and

The major cancellations that bring (A.17) to the form displayed convince us of the cor-
rectness of our results. There are also other independent checks available because results
for various ﬁve-fold traces with no more than three free indices (vertex corrections, in the
diagrammatic language) are known, which we can reproduce. We also note that (A.16)
simpliﬁes, not only in the case of SU(3) when (6.7) is used to obtain

TrD(aDbDcDdDe) =

d(abcδde)

,

(A.18)

but also for SU(4), after use of (6.6), giving

Note that (A.18) and (A.19) may be obtained by contracting the expression

d(abcδde).

TrD(aDbDcDdDe) = A′′d(abcδde)

(A.20)

with δab; the resulting equation gives A′′ =

Finally, we note that, once (A.16) has been evaluated and further ﬁve-fold traces ob-

This involves expansion of the left side in terms of a basis [25, 31], of totally symmetric

Some further comments are now in order. Many of the procedures followed above

line loops with the aid of (A.2). Then we learn how to handle in turn all loops of four
and ﬁve internal lines. The calculations associated with (A.21) are organised by looking
at contractions diagrammatically, preferring to simplify at all times by identifying loops of
as few lines as possible. It should be noted that many of the identities of this appendix
have been evaluated by diﬀerent means including the use of MAPLE. Also. we emphasise

30

that a large number of checks of our results were made by passing to subcases for which
identities were given in [33].

We turn next to the use of the identities presented in this appendix in the derivation

of results quoted in the body of the paper. Consider, e.g. (6.14)

tp1p2p3p4 = Ad(4)

(p1p2p3p4) + Bδ(p1p2δp3p4).

(A.22)

Contractions with δp1p2 and dp1p2q on the right are easy to do, as is the contraction of the
left side with δp1p2. The latter gives zero by direct calculation as required by Lemma 3.2.
The contraction tp1p2p3p4dp1p2q is not governed by any general argument. To compute it,
we set out from (see (3.15)),

and the cocycles deﬁned using the d-family

tpqrg = Ω(7)

abcdef gfabpfcdqfef r,

Ω(7)
abcdef g = Ω(5)

((7.5), cf. (7.2)) for SU(n). Patient evaluation of the terms involved can be completed with
the aid of four-fold traces evaluated earlier in this appendix and not (it seems) without
them. It is clear that the occurrence of f -tensors in the cocycle deﬁnitions is what requires
us to know how to treat traces involving F as well as D matrices. Equation (6.14) emerges
after typical and reassuring cancellations. To obtain (6.15) with λ(n) left undetermined, it
is necessary only to compute the ratio of the two scalars occurring in the expansion with
(5) of the left side of (6.15). This requires only contraction
respect to the basis [25, 31] of
with δp1p2 which is zero.

V

To prove the result for K (5)(n) in (6.23), we set out from (6.15). The only hard part

involves

d(5)
(abcde)d(5)

(abcde) = d(5)

(abcde)d(5)

abcde = d(5)

(abcde)dabxdxcydyde

,

(A.26)

and at worst two equal terms of the ﬁfteen involved lead to a contracted four-fold trace of
D matrices known from [33]. The result is d(5)

96n2 + 480).

abcde = (n2−4)(n2−1)

(abcde)d(5)

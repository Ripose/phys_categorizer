Highest resolution laser spectroscopy has generally been limited to single trapped ion 

systems due to rapid decoherence which plagues neutral atom ensembles.  Here, precision 

spectroscopy of ultracold neutral atoms confined in a trapping potential shows superior 

optical coherence without any deleterious effects from motional degrees of freedom, 

revealing optical resonance linewidths at the hertz level with an excellent signal to noise 

ratio. The resonance quality factor of 2.4 x 1014 is the highest ever recovered in any form 

of coherent spectroscopy. The spectral resolution permits direct observation of the 

breaking of nuclear spin degeneracy for the 1S0 and 3P0 optical clock states of 87Sr under a 

small magnetic bias field. This optical NMR-like approach allows an accurate 

measurement of the differential Landé g-factor between the two states. The optical 

atomic coherence demonstrated for collective excitation of a large number of atoms will 

have a strong impact on quantum measurement and precision frequency metrology.

The relative rates of coherent interaction and decoherence in a quantum system are of 

fundamental importance for both quantum information science (1) and precision 

metrology (2). Enhancing their ratio, which is equivalent to improving spectral resolving 

power, characterizes much of the recent progress in these fields. Trapped ions have so far 

provided the best platform for research along this direction, resulting in a number of 

seminal achievements (3-8). The principal advantage of the ion system lies in the clean 

separation between the internal atomic state and the external center-of-mass motion, 

leading to long coherence times associated with both degrees of freedom. A large 

ensemble of neutral atoms offers obvious benefits in the signal size and scalability of a 

quantum system (9, 10). Multi-atom collective effects can also dramatically enhance the 

coherent matter-field interaction strength (11). However, systems based on neutral atoms 

normally suffer from decoherence due to coupling between their internal and external 

degrees of freedom (12).  In this article we report a record-level spectral resolution in the 

optical domain based on a doubly forbidden transition in neutral atomic strontium. The 

atoms are confined in an optical trapping potential engineered for accurate separation 

between these degrees of freedom (13). The large number of quantum absorbers provides 

a dramatic enhancement in signal size for the recovered hertz-linewidth optical resonance 

profile.  

 

The demonstrated neutral atom coherence properties will impact a number of research 

fields, with some initial results reported here. Optical atomic clocks (14) benefit directly 

from the enhanced signal size and the high resonance quality factor. Tests of atomic 

theory can be performed with increased precision. The available spectral resolution also 

3 

enables a direct optical manipulation of nuclear spins that are decoupled from the 

electronic angular momentum. Nuclear spins can have an exceedingly long relaxation 

time, making them a valuable alternative for quantum information processing and storage 

(15). Two ground state nuclear spins can, for example, be entangled through dipolar 

interactions when photoassociation channels to high-lying electronic states (such as 3P1) 

are excited (16). Combined with a quantum degenerate gas, the enhanced measurement 

precision will further strengthen the prospects of using optical lattices to engineer 

condensed matter systems, e.g. allowing massively parallel quantum measurements.  

 

 

Much of the recent interest in alkaline earth atoms (and similar atoms and ions such as 

Yb, Hg, In+, and Al+) arises from the study of the forbidden optical transitions both for 

metrological applications and as a handle for quantum control, with an important 

achievement being highly effective narrow line laser cooling (17-19).  The spin-forbidden 

1S0 - 3P1 transition has been extensively studied as a potential optical frequency standard 

in Mg (20), Ca (21), and Sr (22), and has recently been explored as a tool for high 

resolution molecular spectroscopy via photoassociation in ultracold Sr (16).  The doubly 

forbidden 1S0-3P0 transition is weakly allowed due to hyperfine-induced state mixing, 

yielding a linewidth of ~1 mHz for 87Sr with a nuclear spin of 9/2.  This transition is a 

particularly attractive candidate for optical domain experiments where long coherence 

times are desirable, and is currently being aggressively pursued for the realization of an 

optical atomic clock (23-25). Furthermore, due to the lack of electronic angular 

momentum, the level shifts of the two states can be matched with high accuracy in an 

optical trap (13), such that external motions do not decohere the superposition of the two 

 

 

 

4 

states. Using optically cooled 87Sr atoms in a zero-differential-Stark-shift 1D optical 

lattice and a cavity-stabilized probe laser with a sub-Hz spectral width, we have achieved 

probe-time-limited resonance linewidths of 1.8 Hz at the optical carrier frequency of 

4.3x1014 Hz. The ratio of these frequencies, corresponding to a resonance quality factor Q 

≈ 2.4 x1014, is the highest obtained for any coherent spectral feature.  

This ultrahigh spectral resolution allows us to perform experiments in the optical domain 

analogous to radio-frequency nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. Under a small 

magnetic bias field, we make direct observations of the magnetic sublevels associated 

with the nuclear spin. Furthermore, we have precisely determined the differential Landé 

g-factor between 1S0 and 3P0 that arises from hyperfine mixing of 3P0 with 3P1 and 1P1. 

This optical measurement approach uses only a small magnetic bias field, whereas 

traditional NMR experiments performed on a single state (either 1S0 or 3P0) would need 

large magnetic fields to induce splitting in the radio frequency range. As the state mixing 

between 3P0, 3P1, and 1P1 arises from both hyperfine interactions and external fields, the 

use of a small field permits an accurate, unperturbed measurement of mixing effects. 

Optical manipulation of nuclear spins shielded by two spin-paired valence electrons, 

performed with a superior spatial and atomic state selectivity, may provide an attractive 

choice for quantum information science.  

Optical atomic clocks based on neutral atoms benefit directly from a large signal to noise 

ratio (S/N) and a superior line Q.  Resolving nuclear sublevels with optical spectroscopy 

permits improved measurements of systematic errors associated with the nuclear spin, 

5 

such as linear Zeeman shifts, and tensor polarizability that manifests itself as nuclear 

spin-dependent trap polarization sensitivity. Tensor polarizability of the 3P0 state is one of 

the important potential systematic uncertainties for fermion-based clocks, and is one of 

the primary motivations for recent proposals involving electromagnetically induced 

transparency resonances or DC magnetic field-induced state mixing in bosonic isotopes 

(26-28). The work reported here has permitted control of these systematic effects to 

~5x10-16 (29). Given the superior S/N from the large number of quantum absorbers, we 

expect this system to be competitive among the best performing clocks in terms of 

stability. Accuracy is already approaching the level of the best atomic fountain clocks 

(30, 31), and absolute frequency measurement is limited by the Cs-clock-calibrated maser 

signal available to us via a fiber link (32). An all-optical clock comparison is necessary to 

reveal its greater potential.   

 

 

To fully exploit the ultranarrow hyperfine-induced transition for high precision 

spectroscopy it is critical to minimize decoherence from both fundamental and technical 

origins. The ~100-s coherence time available from the 87Sr atoms is not yet 

experimentally practical due to environmental perturbations to the probe laser phase at 

long time scales, but atomic coherence in the optical domain at 1 s can already greatly 

improve the current optical clock and quantum measurements.  To achieve long atomic 

coherence times, we trap atoms in an optical lattice with a zero net AC Stark shift 

between the two clock states, enabling a large number of neutral atoms to be interrogated 

free of perturbations.  The tight atomic confinement enables long probing times and 

permits spectroscopy free of broadening by atomic motion and photon recoil.  

6 

 

 

 

For the highest spectral resolution, it is necessary for the probe laser to have a narrow 

intrinsic linewidth and a stable center frequency.  A cavity-stabilized 698 nm diode laser 

is used as the optical local oscillator for 1S0 – 3P0 spectroscopy. The linewidth of this 

oscillator has been characterized by comparison with a second laser operating at 1064 nm 

(33) via an optical frequency comb linking the two distant colors.  A heterodyne optical 

beat signal between the two lasers, measured by the frequency comb, reveals a laser 

linewidth of < 0.3 Hz (resolution-bandwidth-limited) at 1064 nm for a 3-s integration 

time.  This result demonstrates the ability of the frequency comb to transfer optical phase 

coherence (~1 rad/s) across hundreds of terahertz.  Our frequency comb is also referenced 

to a hydrogen maser calibrated by the NIST F1 Cs fountain clock (30), allowing us to 

accurately measure the probe laser frequency to 3 x 10-13 at 1 s.  Additionally, the 698 nm 

laser has been compared with an independent laser system operating at the same 

wavelength, revealing resolution-bandwidth-limited laser linewidth of 0.2 Hz, which 

increases to ~2 Hz for a 30 s integration time. After removing the linear drift, the stability 

of this local oscillator is about 1x10-15 from 1 s to 1000 s, limited by the thermal noise of 

the cavity mirrors (34). Thus the probe laser provides the optical coherence needed to 

perform experiments at the 1 s time scale.  

87Sr atoms are captured from an atomic beam and cooled to 1 mK using a magneto-

optical trap (MOT) acting on the strong 1S0 - 1P1 transition (Fig. 1A).  This step is 

followed by a second-stage MOT using the narrow 1S0 - 3P1 intercombination line that 

cools the atoms to ~1.5 µK.  During narrow line cooling, a nearly vertical one 

7 

dimensional lattice is overlapped with the atom cloud for simultaneous cooling and 

trapping.  The lattice is generated by a ~300 mW standing wave with a 60 µm beam waist 

at the wavelength of 813.428(1) nm, where the 1S0 and 3P0 ac Stark shifts from the 

trapping field are equal (35).  The cooling and loading stages take roughly 0.7 s and result 

in a sample of 104 atoms, spread among ~100 lattice sites.  The vacuum-limited lattice 

lifetime is > 1 s. The atoms are confined in the Lamb-Dicke regime along the axis of the 

optical lattice. The Lamb-Dicke parameter, or the square root of the ratio of recoil 

frequency to trap oscillation frequency, is ~0.3. Both the axial and radial trap frequencies 

are much larger than the 1S0 - 3P0 transition linewidth, leading to the spectral feature 

comprised of a sharp optical carrier and two sets of resolved motional sidebands. One 

pair of sidebands is observed ± 40 kHz away from the carrier, corresponding to the axial 

oscillation frequency in the lattice. The red-detuned sideband is strongly suppressed, 

indicating that nearly all atoms are in the motional ground state along the lattice axis. The 

second pair of sidebands at ±125 Hz from the carrier, with nearly equal amplitudes, 

corresponds to the trap oscillation frequency in the transverse plane.   

 

 

With atoms confined in the lattice, the linearly polarized (parallel to the lattice 

polarization) 698 nm laser drives the π transitions (Fig. 1B) for probe times between 0.08 

and 1 s, depending on the desired spectral resolution limited by the Fourier transform of 

the probe time. The effect of the probe laser is detected in two ways. First, after some 

atoms are excited to the long-lived 3P0 state by the probe laser, the remaining 1S0 

population is measured by exciting the strong 1S0-1P1 transition with a resonant pulse at 

461 nm. The 1S0 - 1P1 pulse scatters a large number of signal photons and heats the 1S0 

8 

atoms out of the lattice, leaving only the 3P0 atoms.  Once the 1S0 atoms have been 

removed, the 3P0 population is determined by driving the 3P0 - 3S1 and 3P2 - 3S1 transitions 

(Fig. 1A) resulting in atomic decay to the ground state via 3P1 for a second measurement 

using the 1S0 - 1P1 pulse. The second measurement provides superior S/N because only 

atoms initially excited by the 698 nm probe laser contribute to the fluorescence signal, 

and the zero background is not affected by shot-to-shot atom number fluctuations. 

Combining both approaches permits signal normalization against atom number 

fluctuations.   

 

 

Although the 3P0 and 1S0 states are magnetically insensitive to first order, the hyperfine-

induced state mixing, which allows the otherwise forbidden transition, modifies the 3P0 

nuclear g-factor by about 50%. This results in a linear Zeeman shift in the 1S0 - 3P0 

transition of ~ -100 Hz/G per magnetic sublevel mF (36, 37), where we use the convention 

that the g-factor and nuclear magnetic moment carry the same sign and 1 G = 10-4 T. This 

effect is shown schematically in Fig. 1B where the 10 nuclear spin sublevels are resolved 

for the 1S0 and 3P0 states in the presence of a magnetic field.  The linear Zeeman shift is 

an important issue for high resolution spectroscopy as the magnetic sensitivity can cause 

significant broadening of the transition, as well as line center shifts due to unbalanced 

population distribution among the sublevels.  To achieve the narrowest resonance, the 

ambient magnetic field must be compensated with three orthogonal sets of Helmholtz 

coils. An example of this zeroing process is shown in Fig. 2A, where the transition 

linewidths are measured under various field strengths. After zeroing the field, narrow 

resonances as in Fig. 2B are routinely obtained.  The displayed transition linewidth of 4.5 

9 

Hz (full width at half maximum, or FWHM) represents a resonance Q of ~1014.  The 

good S/N for the narrow line resonance achieved without any averaging or normalization 

arises from the contribution of 104 atoms. The ultrahigh spectral resolution has allowed a 

recent measurement of systematic effects for the optical clock transition at the 9x10-16 

level (29). 

The high resolution spectroscopy enables direct measurement of the differential Landé g-

factor (∆g) between 3P0 and 1S0.  To observe this state mixing effect, a small magnetic 

field (< 1 G) is applied along the direction of the lattice polarization, and the probe laser 

polarization is again fixed along this quantization axis to drive π transitions. Figure 2C 

shows a direct observation of the hyperfine-induced state mixing in the form of 10 

resolved transition components, with their relative amplitudes influenced by the Clebsch-

Gordan coefficients. The narrow linewidth of the forbidden transition allows this NMR-

like experiment to be performed optically at small magnetic fields.  The magnitude of ∆g 

can be measured by mapping out the line splitting vs. magnetic field.  Alternatively, 

eighteen σ+

 and σ- transitions (Fig. 1B) can be employed to extract both the magnitude 

and sign (relative to the known 1S0 g-factor (38)) of ∆g, without accurate calibration of 

the field.  Using the latter approach, we find ∆g = -108.8(4) Hz/(G mF). The measured ∆g 

permits determination of the 3P0 lifetime of 140 (40) s, in agreement with recent ab initio 

calculations (39, 40). The uncertainty is largely dominated by inconsistencies among 

hyperfine mixing models (36, 37).

The linewidth of each spectral feature in Fig. 2C is Fourier limited by the 80 ms probe 

time to ~10 Hz. With the nuclear spin degeneracy removed by a small magnetic field, 

individual transition components allow exploration of the ultimate limit of our spectral 

resolution by eliminating any broadening mechanisms due to residual magnetic fields or 

light shifts, the likely limitation for data such as in Fig. 2B.  To reduce the Fourier limit 

for the linewidth, the spectra of a single resolved sublevel (mF = 5/2 in this case) are 

probed using π-polarization with the time window extended to ~480 ms. Figures 3 A and 

B show some sample spectra of the isolated 1S0 (mF = 5/2) – 3P0 (mF = 5/2) transition with 

a Fourier limited linewidth of 1.8 Hz, representing a line Q of ~ 2.4x1014.  This Q is 

reproduced reliably, as evidenced by the histogram of linewidths measured in the course 

of one hour (Fig. 3C). Typical linewidths are ~1 – 3 Hz with the statistical scatter owing 

to residual probe laser noise at the 10-s time scale.   

 

 

To further explore the limit of coherent atom-light interactions, two-pulse optical Ramsey 

experiments have also been performed on an isolated π transition. When a system is 

lifetime limited, the Ramsey technique can achieve higher spectral resolution at the 

expense of signal-to-noise ratio, leading to useful information on the decoherence 

process. By performing the experiment in the lattice, the Ramsey interrogation pulse can 

be prolonged, resulting in a drastically reduced Rabi pedestal width compared to free-

space spectroscopy. The reduced number of fringes greatly simplifies identification of the 

central fringe for applications such as frequency metrology.  The fringe period (in Hz) is 

determined by the sum of the pulse interrogation time, τR, and the free-evolution time 

between pulses, TR, and is given by 

(1

R T+τ

)

.  Figure 3D shows a sample Ramsey 

 

 

 

11 

spectrum, where τR = 20 ms and TR = 25 ms, yielding a fringe pattern with a period of 

20.8(3) Hz and fringe FWHM 10.4(2) Hz. For the same transition with τR  raised to 80 ms 

and TR to 200 ms (Fig. 3D inset) the width of the Rabi pedestal is reduced to ~10 Hz and 

the recorded fringe linewidth is 1.7(1) Hz.  

This linewidth is recovered without significant degradation of the fringe S/N, suggesting 

that the spectral resolution is limited by phase decoherence between light and atoms, and 

not effects such as trap lifetime.  A limit of 1 - 2 Hz is consistent with our measurements 

of the probe laser noise integrated over the timescales used for spectroscopy.  Other 

potential limitations to the spectral width include Doppler broadening due to relative 

motion between the lattice and probe beams, and broadening due to tunneling in the 

lattice. Future measurements will be improved by locking the probe laser to one of the 

resolved nuclear spin transitions to further suppress residual laser fluctuations. Although 

the S/N associated with a sublevel resonance is reduced compared to a measurement 

involving all degenerate sublevels, >103 atoms still contribute to the signal, which allows 

measurement to proceed without averaging.  Improvements to the S/N by a factor of ~3 

could be achieved by spin-polarizing the atoms into a single sublevel. Employing DC or 

optical mixing schemes using the bosonic isotope 88Sr could further enhance the S/N by a 

factor of ~4 due to the increased natural abundance and a non-degenerate ground state.     

The line Q of ~2.4x1014 achieved here provides practical improvements in the fields of 

precision spectroscopy and quantum measurement. The neutral atom-based spectroscopic 

system now parallels the best ion systems in terms of fractional resolution but greatly 

12 

surpasses the latter in signal size.  For optical frequency standards, the high resolution 

presented here has improved studies of systematic errors for clock accuracy evaluation.  

With these narrow resonances, clock instability below 10-16 at 100 s is anticipated in the 

near future.  For quantum physics and engineering, this system opens the door to using 

neutral atoms for experiments where long coherence times are necessary, motional and 

internal atomic quantum states must be controlled independently, and many parallel 

processors are desired.

Fig. 1  (A) Partial 87Sr energy level diagram.  Solid arrows show relevant electric dipole 

transitions with wavelengths in nm.  Dashed arrows show the hyperfine 

interaction-induced state mixing between 3P0 and 3P1 and between 3P0 and 1P1, 

which provides the non-zero electric dipole moment for the doubly forbidden 698 

nm transition.  (B) The mixing alters the Landé g-factor of the 3P0 state such that 

it is ~50% larger than that of 1S0, resulting in a linear Zeeman shift for the 1S0-3P0 

transition in the presence of a small magnetic field.  The large nuclear spin of 87Sr 

(I=9/2) results in 10 sublevels for the 1S0 and 3P0 states, providing 28 possible 

transitions from the ground state.

Fig. 2  Spectroscopy of the 1S0-3P0 transition in 87Sr.  A pair of Helmholtz coils provides 

a variable field along the lattice (and probe) polarization axis allowing a 

measurement of the field-dependent transition linewidth as shown in (A) where an 

80 ms interrogation pulse is used, limiting the width to ~10 Hz.  (B) A 

representative spectrum when the ambient field is well controlled.  Here a longer 

pulse is used (~480ms, or a 1.8 Hz Fourier limit) but the linewidth is limited to 

4.5 Hz by residual magnetic fields and possibly residual Stark shifts. (C) A field 

of 0.77 G is applied along the polarization axis, and the individual Fourier-limited 

18 

(10 Hz) π transitions are easily resolved.  Data are shown in red and a fit of 10 

evenly spaced transitions is shown in blue. The calculated transition probabilities 

based on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are included in the inset.  In (B) and (C) the 

population is scaled by the total number of atoms available for spectroscopy 

(~104).

Fig. 3  Spectroscopy of the isolated 1S0 (mF = 5/2) – 3P0 (mF = 5/2) transition.  Resolving 

individual sublevels allows spectroscopy without magnetic or Stark broadening.  

Spectra in (A) and (B) are taken under identical experimental conditions using a 

pulse time of 480 ms, and linewidths of 1.5(2) and 2.1(2) Hz are achieved. (C) A 

histogram of the linewidths of 28 traces within ~1 hour.  The average linewidth in 

(C) is near the 1.8-Hz Fourier limit. (D) Ramsey fringes with a 20.8(3) Hz period 

and 10.4(2) Hz fringe width, with data shown as open circles. Inset shows a 

Ramsey pattern with a 1.7(1) Hz fringe FWHM.

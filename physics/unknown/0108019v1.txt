ABSTRACT 
 
The  influence  of  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO)  on  membrane  thickness,  multilamellar 
repeat  distance,  and  phase  transitions  of  1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine 
(DPPC)  was  investigated  by  X-ray  diffraction  and  small-angle  neutron  scattering  (SANS). 
The  differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC)  study  of  water  freezing  and  ice  melting  was 
performed  in  the  ternary  DPPC /DMSO /water  and  binary  DMSO /water  systems.  The 
methods applied demonstrated the differences in membrane structure in three sub-regions of 
the DMSO mole fraction (XDMSO): from 0.0 to 0.3 for the first, from 0.3 to 0.8 for the second, 
and  from  0.9  to  1.0  for  the  third  sub-region.  The  thickness  of  the  intermembrane  solvent  at 
T =20oC decreases from 14.4 ± 1.8 Å at XDMSO =0.0 to 7.8 ± 1.8 Å at XDMSO =0.1. The data 
were used to determine the number of free water molecules in the intermembrane space in the 
presence  of  DMSO.  The  results  for  0.0 ≤ XDMSO ≤ 0.3  were  explained  in  the  framework  of 
DMSO-induced dehydration of the intermembrane space.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Dimethyl sulfoxide has two very important biological properties: a) ability to protect a 
variety of cells from the damaging effects of freezing and storage at a very low temperature, 
b)  the  modification  of  X-ray  induced  damage  in  cells  and  whole  animals  when  DMSO  is 
present before and during exposure to radiation [1]. 
 
The  main  purpose  of  cryobiology  is  to  find  an  "optimal"  way  of  cooling  biological 
systems to low temperatures (about the temperature of liquid nitrogen) and, at the same time, 
prevent  the  formation  of  ice  inside  the  biological  tissue.  The  mechanism  of  DMSO 
cryoprotection is still debated and, on the molecular level, it is not clear [2].  
 
DMSO  makes  hydrogen  bonds  with  water  molecules.  The  structure  of  the  binary 
DMSO /water  system  has  been  studied  by  means  of  the  spin–lattice  relaxation  and  the 
chemical shift behavior of water and DMSO protons [3]. It was found that DMSO and water 
molecules  tend  to  form  hydrogen  bonds  in  the  relation  1/2  (mole  DMSO  fraction 
XDMSO = 0.33)  or  1/3  (XDMSO = 0.25).  The  DMSO /water  phase  diagram  is  well  known  [4] 
and  the  phase  behavior  of  the  binary  DPPC /water  system  has  been  investigated  by 
calorimetry [5]. The influence of DMSO fraction on the pre–transition existence and on the 
repeat distance of the DPPC multilamellar structure has been studied for the region of a small 
DMSO  mole  fraction,  XDMSO ≤ 0.13.  From  the  calculation  of  the  electron  density  profile,  it 
was  established  that  the  intermembrane  solvent  space  decreases  with  the  increasing  DMSO 
concentration [6].  
 
In  the  present  paper,  the  influence  of  DMSO  on  1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphatidylcholine  (DPPC)  membranes  was  studied  by  X-ray  diffraction,  small-angle 
neutron scattering (SANS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Our purpose was to 
obtain information on changes in the structure of DPPC in the presence of DMSO at T=20oC 
and  during  the  formation  of  ice.  Calorimetric  and  time  resolved  X-ray  diffraction 
the 
measurements  were  performed 
DPPC/DMSO/water system for 0.0 ≤ XDMSO ≤ 1.0.

the  phospholipid/water  system.  Water 
in 
molecules are divided into three fractions: the 
first  −  free  water  molecules  located  in  the 
center of the intermembrane space; the second 
−  bound  water  molecules  located  in  the 
intermembrane  space  near  the  polar  heads  of 
DPPC  molecules;  the  third  -  bound  water 
molecules  located  in  the  spatial  region  of 
DPPC head groups. 
 

 
 
The  phospholipid /water  multilayer  system  (multilamellar  membrane)  can  be 
represented as described in Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 presents the model for the water arrangement 
in  the  intermembrane  space.  It  is  possible  to  divide  water  molecules  into  two  fractions:  a) 
bound  water  −  where  water  molecules  are  bonded  to  the  polar  head  groups  of  the 
phospholipid molecules; b) free water molecules, which exist between lipid bilayers without 
any  interaction  with  membrane  surface.  The  bound  water  can  be  further  divided  into  the 
fraction of molecules embedded in the spatial region of the polar head groups and the fraction 
located in the intermembrane space near the polar head groups. The number of bound water

molecules located in the region of the polar head groups and in the intermembrane space is 
equal to 2.2 and 8.6 per DPPC molecule, respectively; the number of free water molecules per 
DPPC molecule is equal to four [5, 7]. 

2. MATERIALS 
 
1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC, > 99% purity) was purchased 
from  Sigma  corporation  (Paris,  France).  Spectrophotometric  grade  dimethyl  sulfoxide 
(DMSO, > 99% purity) and deuterated DMSO (99.9%) were purchased from Aldrich (Paris, 
France). Water was of Millipore standard (18 MΩ ⋅ cm). 
 
3. SAMPLE PREPARATION 
The samples were prepared either in eppendorfs for calorimetry or in capillaries for X-
 
ray  diffraction.  The  X-ray  quartz  capillaries  (1.5 mm  in  diameter  with  0.01 mm  wall 
thickness)  were  purchased  from  GLAS  company (W.Muller, Berlin, Germany). The desired 
amount  of  lipid  and  DMSO / water  solution  was  placed  in  the  containers.  Both,  eppendorfs 
and  capillaries  were  hermetically  sealed  with  paraffin.  The  samples  were  heated  to  a 
temperature  above  the  main  phase  transition  temperature  and  sonicated  in  the  Branson 
sonicator for 5 min. After sonication, the samples were stored at a temperature above the main 
phase  transition  temperature  for  about  3  hours  and  then  cooled    to  room  temperature.  The 
heating/cooling  process  was  repeated  4  times  in  order  to  obtain  a  homogeneous  DPPC 
multilamellar  suspension,  which  is  necessary  for  calorimetry  and  for  powder  diffraction 
studies  of  the  membrane  structure  [8].  One  drop  of  the  sample  was  placed  in  each  sealed 
aluminium  platelet  for  the  differential  scanning  calorimetry  measurements.  The  sample 
weight in the platelets was 10 to 15 mg.  
 
The weight ratio between DPPC and solvent was chosen to keep the number of solvent 
molecules  per  DPPC  molecule  constant.  Let  us  denote  the  number  of  DMSO,  water,  and 
DPPC molecules as NDMSO, Nw, and Nlip, respectively. We denote the weights of the solvent 
and  DPPC  in  the  sample  as  Wsol  and  WDPPC.  For  DPPC  in  pure  water,  the  ratio 
Nw / Nlip = 40.8 corresponds to the ratio Wsol /  WDPPC = 1. For DPPC in the DMSO / water 
mixture,  the  ratio  (NDMSO + Nw) / Nlip  was  kept  equal  to  40.8  for  all  samples  used  in  the 
diffraction  and  calorimetry  study.  This  means  that  the  solvent  concentration  in  the  sample 
Wsol / (Wsol + WDPPC)  is  larger  than  0.5  for  all  DMSO  concentrations.  All  measurements 
were performed with an excess of the solvent. The mole fraction of DMSO XDMSO is defined 
as the mole fraction of DMSO in the solvent mixture NDMSO / (NDMSO + Nw). 
 
For  the  SANS  study,  we  used  large  unilamellar  vesicles  prepared  by  the  extrusion  of 
heated  (50-60°C)  1%  (w/w)  DPPC  dispersion  through  Nuclepore  membrane  filters  (pores 
2000 Å in diameter) [9]. 
 
4. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 
 
The X-ray diffraction experiment was carried out at the D-22 and D-24 spectrometers of 
the  DCI  synchrotron  ring.  Fig. 3  presents  the  X-ray  diffraction  pattern  for  the  DPPC/water 
system at T = 20°C measured at the D-24 spectrometer. The sample-to-detector distance was 
chosen to be small enough (314mm) to measure the small-angle diffraction pattern from the 
multilamellar DPPC structure (the region of scattering vector q of 0.0 Å-1≤ q ≤ 0.5 Å-1) and to 
also measure, at the same time, the wide-angle diffraction peaks from the hydrocarbon chains 
of  DPPC  (q ≈ 1.5 Å-1).  The  five  diffraction  peaks  from  the  multilamellar  DPPC  structure 
correspond to the membrane repeat distance d = 63.7 ± 3.2Å (see Fig. 2). 

 

 

 

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 286 (1999) 195-202 
 

In  the  region  of  q ≈ 1.5 Å-1,  the  diffraction  pattern  is  interpreted  as  diffraction  on  a 
  
quasihexagonal  lattice  from  the  hydrocarborn  chains.  The  sharp  reflex  at  q = 1.50Å-1 
corresponds  to  the  lattice  constant  4.19 ± 0.06Å,  the  “shoulder”  on  the  side  of  large q is  an 
additional  wide  diffraction  peak  (q = 1.53Å-1)  from  the  lattice  constant  4.11 ± 0.06Å.  The 
diffraction  pattern  on  Fig. 3  contains  a  full  information  about  lamellar  and  lateral  DPPC 
membrane  structures,  nevertheless  this  geometry  results  in  a  large  uncertainty  in  the 
determination  of  the  repeat  distance  (about  5 %)  compared  with  the  uncertainty  in  the 
determination  of  the  lattice  constants  for  hydrocarbon  chains  (about  1.5 %).  An  increase  in 
sample-to-detector distance reduces the experimental errors in the determination of d, which 
is necessary for the phase transitions investigation in the DPPC/DMSO/water system. For this 
reason,  the  sample-to-detector  distance  Ls-d  was  chosen  to  be  788mm,  which  gives  an 
uncertainty  in  the  determination  of  the  repeat  distance  of  1.2 %  -  1.4 %  for  different  DPPC 
phases. 
 
The  D22  spectrometer  was  chosen  because  it  had  better  resolution  than  the  D24 
spectrometer.  With Ls-d = 788mm. and  with direct beam location in the center  of the linear 
position  sensitive  detector,  only  the  first  order  diffraction  was  detected  from  the  DPPC 
multilamellar  structure.  Fig. 4  shows  the  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  measured  at  the  D22 
spectrometer.  The  repeat  distance  d  of  the  multilamellar  structure  was  determined  from  the 
position of the diffraction peak using the Bragg equation 2d sinθ = n λ, where θ is the half of 
the scattering angle and n is the order of the diffraction peak, which is n=1 in our experiment.

SANS measurements were performed at the YuMO time-of-flight small-angle 
spectrometer  (pulse  neutron  source  IBR-2)  in  the  Frank  Laboratory  of  Neutron 
Physics.  Guinier  approximation  of  the  scattering  cross-section  was  used  to  interpret 
the  neutron  small-angle  scattering  spectra  [10, 11].  For  unilamellar  vesicles  with  a

where ∆ρ is the scattering length density relative to the solvent. For a homogeneous 
12  [10, 
membrane, the membrane thickness dl is calculated by the formula  d
11, 12]. 
 
Differential  thermal  analysis  measurements  were  performed  using  the  Perkin 
Elmer  DSC 4  calorimeter.  For  investigations  of  the  main  phase  transition  and  pre-
transition,  the  temperature  interval  from  0°C  to  85°C  and  the  scanning  rate  of  2.0 
degrees  per  minute  were  used.  The  phase  transition  of  lauric  acid  (Tph = 43.7°C, 
∆H = 42.58 cal / g) was used for calibration. To study the phase transitions associated 
with the freezing of water and melting of ice, the temperature interval from 20°C to –
130°C and the scanning rate of 10 degrees per minute were used. In this case, we used 
the melting temperature of pure water for calibration. 
 
5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
5.1. Influence of DMSO on the Structure and Main Phase Transitions  

Fig. 4 depicts the sequence of diffraction patterns recorded with an acquisition 
time  of  2 min  on  heating  the  sample  from  T = 25°C  to  T = 80°C.  The  heating  rate 
1°C/min  was  used  in  the  temperature  ranges  25°C - 40°C  and  50°C `- 80°C.  In  the 
temperature  range  from  40°C  to  50°C,  the  heating  rate  was  decreased  down  to 
0.5°C/min,  which  gave  us  a  1°C  step  between  the  diffraction  patterns.  For  precise 
measurements,  the  heating  rate  of  0.2°C/min  was  used  in  the  region  near  the  main 
phase  transition  in  order  to  obtain  a  more  accurate  determination  of  the  phase 
transition temperature. This gave us an accuracy of ± 0.4°C for the determination of 
the phase transition temperature. 

In  the  temperature  interval  25°C - 33°C,  the  diffraction  patterns  (see  Fig. 4) 
correspond to the gel Lβ′ - phase. From T = 35°C to T = 41°C, the membrane exhibits 
the ripple phase Pβ′, which is characterized by a shift of the diffraction peak to the 
region  of  smaller  q,  by  a  decrease  in  the  diffraction  peak  intensity,  and  by  peak 
broadening. The origin and structure of Pβ′ - phase is still debated. Nevertheless, the 
membrane  undulations  are  a  common  Pβ′ - phase  property  [13].  At  T = 41.5°C,  the 
membrane undergoes a phase transition from the Pβ′ - phase to the liquid crystalline 
Lα - phase,  the  so-called  main  phase  transition  [14].  In  the  temperature  interval  of 
42°C   ≤ T ≤ 80°C  the  diffraction  pattern  correspond  to  the  liquid  crystalline  Lα -
 phase, which is characterized by a melted hydrocarbon chains.  

As the DMSO mole fraction increases, the region of Pβ′ - phase decreases and 
membrane undulations disappear at XDMSO = 0.10. At the same time, the temperature 
of the main phase transition increases with increasing DMSO mole fraction. The same 
result was obtained by differential thermal analysis. Fig. 5 shows the DSC curves for

fractions 

from  XDMSO = 0.00 

to 
six  samples  with  different  DMSO  mole 
XDMSO = 0.10. For example, for the curve recorded from the DPPC /water system, the 
first  endothermic  peak  (so  called  pre-transition)  at  a  temperature  of  about  37°C 
corresponds  to  the  transition  from  the  Lβ′ - phase  to  the  Pβ′ - phase.  The  second 
endothermic  peak  corresponds  to  the  main  phase  transition  from  the  Pβ′   - phase  to 
Lα - phase.  The  difference  between  the  pre-transition  and  the  main  phase  transition 
temperatures  diminishes while XDMSO increases. At XDMSO = 0.10, two endothermic 
peaks merge together and the pre-transition peak disappears. The same phenomenon 
has been recently observed [6], but with a different concentration (XDMSO = 0.04) for 
the pre-transition disappearance. 
 
Fig. 6  presents  the  dependence  of  the  main  phase  transition  temperature  Tch 
and of the repeat distance d on the mole DMSO fraction at T = 20°C measured by X-
ray diffraction and calorimetry. The values of Tch obtained by X-ray diffraction and 
by  calorimetry  are  in  good  agreement.  We  can  divide  the  range  of  the  DMSO 
fractions  into  three  regions.  The  first  is  that  of  small  DMSO  mole  fractions 
(0.0 ≤ XDMSO ≤ 0.3), where important changes in the d and the Tch are observed. The 
second  is  the  region  of  intermediate  DMSO  mole  fractions  (0.3 ≤ XDMSO ≤ 0.8), 
where d and Tch are constant. In the third region, near pure DMSO solvent, the DPPC 
membrane  undergoes  a  transition  towards  a  phase  characterized  by  a  small  repeat 
distance of 52 Å and a high transition temperature of 74.2 ± 0.2oC.  

To  understand  the  described  results  for  the  ternary  DPPC/ DMSO/ water 
system,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  absence  of  the  pre-transition  and  increased 
phase transition temperature are properties of the partly dehydrated DPPC membranes 
in the case of the binary DPPC/ water system [5].

The  repeat  distance  d  of  the  DPPC  multilayer  is  connected  with  the  membrane 
thickness  dl  and  thickness  of  the  solvent  dw  in  the  intermembrane  space  via  the  expression 
d = dl + dw. A decrease in the DPPC membrane repeat distance at T = 20°C can occur as a 
result of dl or dw decrease. The SANS experiment with large unilamellar DPPC vesicles was 
carried  out  to  determine  the  influence  of  DMSO  concentration  on  the  bilayer  thickness  dl. 
The values of dl obtained at T = 20°C with an accuracy of ± 1 Å in the Guinier approximation 
(1) are 49.6 Å  for XDMSO = 0.0, 49.2 Å for XDMSO = 0.05, and 50.1 Å for XDMSO = 0.10. The 
same  results  concerning  the  absence  of  DMSO  influence  on  the  membrane  thickness  were 
obtained  recently  from  the  electron  density  profile  of  the  DPPC /DMSO /water  system  for 
0.0 ≤ XDMSO ≤ 0.13  [6].  This  important  fact  obtained  by  two  different  techniques  applies  to 
the  interaction  of  DMSO  with  respect  to  the  region  of  the  polar  head  groups.  The  DMSO 
molecules  do not penetrate to  the region of the polar head groups of DPPC membrane and, 
thus, have no influence on the membrane thickness.  

Fig. 7  demonstrates  SANS  curves  for  DPPC  vesicles  in  the  deuterated  DMSO /D2O 
solvent.  The  scattering  curves  from  vesicles  in  pure  D2O  and  from  vesicles  in  deuterated 
DMSO /D2O solvent with XDMSO = 0.1 practically coincide. As can be seen from Fig.6, the 
region  0.0 ≤ XDMSO ≤ 0.10  is  the  region  where  the  main  changes  in  the  DPPC  membrane 
repeat  distance  occur.  The  d  decreases  from  64.0 ± 0.8 Å  at  XDMSO = 0.0  to  57.9 ± 0.8 Å  at 
XDMSO =0.1 and, with further increases in XDMSO, the repeat distance diminishes slowly to a 
constant  value  of  about  57 Å.  These  changes  in  the  membrane  structure  correspond  to  a 
decrease  in  the  intermembrane  solvent  thickness  dw  from  14.4 ± 1.8 Å  at  XDMSO =0.0  to 
7.8 ± 1.8 Å  at  XDMSO =0.1,  which  can  be  explained  as  a  reduction of the solvent amount in 
the intermembrane space.  

The  values  of  d = 64.0 ± 0.8 Å  and  dl = 49.6 ± 1.0 Å  obtained  in  our  work  for  the 
DPPC /water system at T = 20°C are in good agreement with the values measured by X-ray

Fig. 8a presents the calorimetric curves (XDMSO = 0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, and 
0.15) for the binary DMSO /water system on cooling from 20°C to –130°C with the rate of –
10°C / min. For the binary DMSO /water system, only one exothermic transition is observed 
in this temperature range. The shape of the transition remains narrow up to XDMSO = 0.1, but 
for larger cryoprotector concentrations, XDMSO = 0.15, the transition becomes broader, as can 
be noted from Fig. 8a. The multiplication factor k was introduced to scale the curves such that 
the amplitude of the transition remains approximately constant. This factor was found to be 
necessary because of the fast decrease in the transition enthalpy when DMSO is added. The 
transitions  for  solutions  with  XDMSO ≤ 0.10  correspond  to  the  creation  of  a  binary  system 
consisting  of  an  ice  and  liquid  DMSO /water  mixture.  The  eutectic  temperature  for  the 
DMSO /water  system  is  – 63°±1°C  [4].  Consequently,  the  exothermic  transition  in  the 
solution  with  XDMSO = 0.15  at  T= – 74.5°C  corresponds  to  the  formation  of  ice  and  solid 
DMSO·3 H2O hydrate.

Fig.  8b  shows  the  calorimetric  curves  (XDMSO = 0.0,  0.01,  0.03,  0.05,  0.06, 
0.07,  0.08,  and  0.1)  for  the  ternary  DPPC /DMSO /water  systems  obtained  under  the  same 
conditions as described above for the binary system. Two exothermic transitions are observed 
at cooling from T = 20°C  to T = –130°C. The first (the temperature is close to the transition 
temperature of the solvent) can be attributed to the ice formation in the DMSO /water solvent 
(ice formation out of the intermembrane space in the bulk solvent). The second transition (the 
temperature  is  from  20  to  45°C  lower  than  that  of  the  first  one)  can  be  attributed  to  the 
freezing of the solvent trapped in the bilayers [5]. A multiplication factor was also introduced 
here  to  scale  the  data.  It  can  be  noticed  that  these  two  transitions  have  distinct  amplitude 
variations  with  the  DMSO  concentration.  While  the  amplitude  of  the  first  transition  is  kept 
roughly  constant,  the  relative  importance  of  the  second  increases  when  DMSO  is  added.

According to our results and the phase diagram of DMSO /water system [4], the ratio between 
the  first  and  the  second  exothermic  transitions  in  the  ternary  DPPC /DMSO /water  system 
corresponds  to  a  decrease  in  the  amount  of  ice  created  outside  the  intermembrane  space 
compared  to  the  amount  of  ice  created  within  the  intermembrane  space.  For  XDMSO ≥ 0.06, 
the second phase transition corresponds to the eutectic transition.

As a result, the actual DMSO concentration X′

 
DMSO in the bulk solvent of the 
ternary  system  will  be  higher  compared  with  the  DMSO /water  solvent  used  for  the 
ternary system preparation. It is possible to estimate the number of water molecules 
that are not mixed with the DMSO molecules from the results presented in Fig. 9. The 
line fitting for the binary and ternary systems of the melting temperature dependence 
on  the  DMSO  fraction  (see  Fig. 9)  gives  the  following  values:  Tbin(XDMSO) = –
 230.3 · XDMSO + 1.7  and  Tter(XDMSO ) = – 302.4 · XDMSO + 0.58,  respectively. 
From 
condition 
(NDMSO + Nw) / Nlip = 40.8, it is possible to calculate that 10 ± 2.6 H2O molecules 
per  DPPC  molecule  are  never  mixed  with  DMSO  and  X′
DMSO = 1.32 XDMSO.  The 
obtained  value  of  unmixed  water  molecules  is  in  agreement  with  a  well-known 
number  of  water  molecules  connected  with  the  polar  head  group  of  one  DPPC 
molecule  nwb ,  which  was  determined  from  DSC  measurement  and  is  equal  to 
10 ÷ 11  molecules  [5].  The  bound  water  has  two  important  properties:  a)  it  is  not 
frozen  at  the  first  exothermic  transition  as  was  established  in  [5],  b)  it  is  not  mixed 
with  DMSO  molecules.  This  fact  supports  the  idea  that  DMSO  molecules  do  not 
penetrate to the region of polar head groups. Moreover, the DSC results give evidence 
that  DMSO  molecules  do  not  penetrate  to  the  region  of  bound  water  (see  Fig. 1). 
DMSO  molecules  penetrate  only  to  the  region  of  free  water  molecules  and,  thus, 
strongly influence the intermembrane space and decrease the solvent thickness. This 
phenomena  can  be  assigned  to  DMSO-induced  dehydration  of  the  intermembrane 
space.

From  equations  (2),  (3),  and  the  experimental  DSC  result,  which  concerns  the 
constant value of the amount of bound water nwb = 10 ±2.6, the decrease in d in the

distance  from  64 Å  to  57 Å  corresponds  to  a  decrease  in  the  number  of  free  water 
molecules by the value of 2.9 ± 0.4.  
As  a  result,  the  region  of  small  DMSO  mole  fractions  corresponds  to  the

relation  1/2  (XDMSO = 0.33)  or  1/3  (XDMSO = 0.25)  [3].  From  this  approach,  the 
property of ternary system at XDMSO ≥0.3 can be tentatively explained as a result of 
the  strong  connection  of  free  water  molecules  and  DMSO  molecules  in  the  bulk 
solvent.  At  0.3≤ XDMSO ≤0.8,  only  bound  water  exists  in  the  DPPC /DMSO /water 
system.  In  this  region,  the  repeat  distance  d = 57 Å  and  the  main  phase  transition 
temperature Tch ≈ 52oC are constant values.  
 
6. CONCLUSIONS 

transition 

The  properties  of  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO),  a  cryoprotector  that  is  well 
known  for  its  biological  and  therapeutic  applications,  were  investigated  for  lipid 
membranes  by  X-ray  diffraction,  small-angle  neutron  scattering,  and  differential 
scanning calorimetry.  

The  more  important  changes  in  the  property  and  structure  of  the  ternary 
DPPC/ DMSO /water system occur at small DMSO fractions of 0.0≤ XDMSO ≤0.3. In 
this  region,  the  main  phase  transition  temperature  increases  from  41.7± 0.2oC  to 
41.7± 0.2oC,  the  pre-transition  disappears,  and  the  thickness  of  the  intermembrane 
solvent dw decreases from 14.4 ± 1.8 Å at XDMSO =0.0 to 7.8 ± 1.8 Å at XDMSO =0.1. 
At  0.3≤ XDMSO ≤0.8,  the  repeat  distance  d = 57 Å  and  the  main  phase  transition 
temperature  Tch ≈ 52oC  are  constant  values.  In  the  region  of  0.9≤ XDMSO ≤1.0,  the 
DPPC  membrane  undergoes  a  transition  towards  a  phase  characterized  by  a  small 
repeat distance of 52 ± 0.8 Å Å and a high transition temperature of 74.2± 0.2oC. 

For 0.0≤ XDMSO ≤0.3  the  DMSO  molecules do not  penetrate to the region of 
the polar head groups of DPPC membrane and, thus, do not influence the membrane 
thickness.  This  was  established  from  the  SANS  experiments.  Moreover,  DMSO 
molecules do not penetrate to the region of the bound water as established from the 
DSC  experiment.  The  decrease  in  the  intermembrane  space  under  the  influence  of 
DMSO  was  determined  from  complementary  SANS  and  X-ray  diffraction 
experiments. 

The DMSO molecules strongly interact with water molecules. This interaction 
is more intensive than the interaction between the DMSO and the polar head groups 
of  DPPC  membrane.  The  DMSO  molecules  penetrate  neither  to  the  region  of  the 
polar  head  groups  nor  to  the  region  of  bound  water,  nevertheless,  they  strongly 
influence  the  intermembrane  solvent  thickness  and,  as  a  result,  create  the  DMSO-
induced dehydration of the intermembrane space. The number of free water molecules 
in  the  intermembrane  space  was  calculated  from  the  common  X-ray  diffraction, 
SANS, and DSC results. At room temperature, the number of free water molecules in 
the  intermembrane  solvent  decreases  with  increasing  DMSO  mole  fraction  and,  at 
XDMSO = 0.14,  only  1.1 ± 0.4  water  molecules  per  DPPC  molecule  exist  without 
connection to the polar head groups.

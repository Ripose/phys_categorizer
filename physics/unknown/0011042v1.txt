Introduction 
 
Throughout history, the human mind has sought to understand its surroundings.  One of 
the  most  fundamental  aspects  of  our  universal  surroundings  is  the  array  of  spatial  and 
temporal  dimensions  within  which  we exist.   Humanity  has slowly  and  discontinuously 
managed to unfold eleven (or twelve) of these dimensions over the last 2550 years or so.  
In  this  paper  the  historical  development  of  the  mathematics  and  physics  behind  the 
discovery of these dimensions is examined from the earliest records of Greek geometers 
and scientists starting in the sixth century BCE through to the most recent developments 
in theoretical physics.  Historical glimpses of the people who have helped to shape these 
developments  are  given  as  a  basis  for  the  mathematical  processes  that  build  up  to  the 
overall worldview.  It is wise to note that there were many parallel developments, notably 
during ancient times, in the Middle East and Far East.  For the sake of brevity they have 
not  been  included  here,  however,  the  reader  is  encouraged  to  explore  these  areas  in 
greater  depth.    In  particular,  the  legacy  of  Euclid  and  Klein  are  developed  in  depth 
working  from  the  Euclidean  concept  that  the  topology  of  the  universe  is  inherently  flat 
and  moving  into  Klein’s  first  use  of  a  curved  dimension  in  modifying  Kaluza’s  initial 
work on five dimensions.  This paper relies heavily on secondary sources as it is merely 
meant to be an introduction to the topic. 
 

Early Developments 
 
The  earliest  developments  in  Greek  mathematics  are  attributed  to  Pythagoras  and  his 
followers.  Pythagoras was born around 570 BCE on the island of Samos off the Ionian 
coast.    He  supposedly  left  the  island  around  540  BCE  out  of  disenchantment  with  the 
ruling Polycrates and fled to Croton.  Croton was a Greek settlement on the southeastern 
coast  of  Italy  on  the  lower  Adriatic.    Once  in  Croton  he  attracted  a  group  of  followers 
who  have  since  been  known  as  the  Pythagoreans,  a  mysterious  group  who  have  been 
revered and copied, reportedly, by druids, masons, and secret societies over the centuries.  
Their  teachings  and,  as  a  result,  those  of  Pythagoras  himself  were  kept  secret.    Most 
knowledge of their teachings was not revealed until nearly a century later in the writings 
of  Philolaus.    Thus  the  teachings  are  far  from  a  direct  account  of  Pythagorean  thought.  
Recent tradition even indicates Pythagoras may have learned much of his teachings from 
other  sources, possibly on a series of travels he had undertaken.  It is said these travels 
were in the East, though there is a persistent legend that quotes him as saying:

All I know I learned from a Druid.2 
 

The  earliest  written  evidence  of  Greek  mathematics  is  in  fact  Euclid’s  Elements.    This 
work dates from the fourth century BCE though much of it is thought to be the work of 
earlier mathematicians, including the Pythagoreans.  Eudemus the Peripatetic attributes to 
them the theorem that describes the sum of the interior angles in a triangle being equal to 
the sum of two right angles.  His description of the Pythagoreans’ proof of the theorem is 
as follows: 
 

 

Let ABC be a triangle, and let the line DE be drawn through 
A parallel  to BC.   Now  since  BC and DE are parallel, and 
the alternate angles are equal, the angle DAB is equal to the 
angle ABC and the angle EAC is equal to the angle ACB. 
 
Let the angle BAC be added to them both.  Then the angles 
DAB,  BAC,  and  CAE  (that  is  to  say,  the  angles  DAB  and 
BAE, i.e., two right angles) are equal to the three angles of 
the triangle ABC. 
 
Hence the three angles of the triangle are equal to two right 
angles.3 
 

According  to  this  proof,  the  Pythagoreans  were  already  familiar  with  the  concept  of 
parallel lines as well as two-dimensional objects.  Certainly, humans were aware of two 
dimensions  from  simple  sensory  perceptions,  however,  this  proof  is  one  of  the  earliest 
pieces  of  evidence  that  indicates  an  understanding  of  the  mathematical  nuances  lying 
behind the physical reality. 
 
Of course, the more famous mathematical construct attributed to the Pythagoreans is the 
famous  Pythagorean  theorem  that  describes  the  sum  of  the  squares  on  the  shortest  two 
sides  of  a  right triangle as being equal  to  the square of  the hypotenuse, or  longest  side.  
The Pythagoreans’ use of one-dimensional lines laid down to describe a two-dimensional 
feature  was  one  of  the  earliest  examples  of  extending  a  single  dimension  in  a  way  that 
creates  an  extra  or  “higher”  orthogonal  dimension.    In  fact,  if  a  single  straight  line  is

considered to be one-dimensional, and a second straight line, non-parallel to the first, is 
laid  down  and  connected  at  any  point  to  the  first,  a  two-dimensional  space  is 
automatically created where a minimum of two position coordinates must be specified in 
order  to  describe  a  single  point  in  that  space.    Realizing  that  such  abstract  spaces  as 
Riemannian  geometry  had  yet  to  be  developed,  this  can  be  considered  one  of  the  first 
mathematical realizations of multi-dimensional space. 
 
In contrast, other Greek geometers used a method that consisted of applying a method of 
“area mathematics” to decipher algebraic problems.  Since they did not possess a form of 
algebra similar to our own, this method of area application allowed them to solve second-
degree equations and formed the basis of Euclid’s work on irrationals. 
 

Euclid’s Elements 
 
Euclid was born around 325 BC.  Not much is known of his life other than the fact that he 
lived  and  worked  in  Alexandria,  Egypt.    From  various  accounts  including  those  of 
Proclus, Euclid compiled and refined the work of many of his predecessors in his famous 
anthology,  The  Elements.    The  exact  nature  of  his  personal  contribution  and  ideas  is 
sketchy.  However, Proclus wrote that Euclid also brought “to irrefutable demonstration 
the things which had been only loosely proved by his predecessors.”4 
 
Euclid’s  Elements  begins  by  defining  certain  terms  vital  to  the  understanding  of 
geometrical space.  It is important to make note of a few of these definitions in our study 
of advancing dimensions. 
 
First,  Euclid  defines  a  point  as  “that  which  has  no  part.”5    He  also  defines  a  line  as  a 
“breadthless point”6 asserting the Pythagorean use of lines as one dimensional objects.  In 
addition,  the  definition  of  a  point  is  of  particular  importance  as  it  is  one  of  the  earliest 
assertions that zero-dimensional objects can be represented mathematically.  As we will 
see,  this  plays  an  important  role  later  in  the  definition  of  string  theory  as  the  original 
concept  of  point-particles  based  on  the  Euclidean  assumption  of  an  indivisible  point  is 
amended and the actual definition of “point-like” is no longer quite the same thing. 
 
Euclid defines a surface as “that which has length and breadth only.”7  It is interesting to 
note  that  Euclid  differentiated  between  this  simple  definition  of  a  surface  and  that  of  a 
plane surface which he defined as “a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on 
itself.”8  What is interesting to note is that the definition of height (as a separate concept 
from  length  and  breadth)  is  not  given  until  Book  VI  and  is  given  completely 
independently of length  and  breadth as “the perpendicular drawn from the vertex to the 
base.”9

that  a 

indication 

 
Euclid’s  first 
third  spatial  dimension  exists  specifically  and 
mathematically  in  relation  to  the  first  two  spatial  dimensions,  comes  in  Book  XI.  
However in Book VII he states that “when three numbers having multiplied one another 
make  some  number,  the  number  so  produced  be  called  solid,  and  its  sides  are  the 
numbers  which  have  multiplied  one  another.”10    The definition in Book XI is the more 
familiar  one.    Here  a  solid  is  defined  as  “that  which  has  length,  breadth,  and  depth.”11  
Further,  a  surface  is  defined  as  the  side  of  a  solid.    Thus  Euclid  took  the  Pythagorean 
concept a step further (at least in ‘print’) and created a third dimension orthogonal to both 
the previous two.  Relating this to my assertion that by simply creating two non-parallel, 
yet  connected  lines,  a  two-dimensional  space  is  immediately  created,  to  ensure  the 
existence  of  the  third  dimension  in  an  additional  space,  three  lines  must  be  connected 
(only once each) and be completely non-parallel, and one must be non-coplanar, to each 
other to ensure three spatial dimensions.  The easiest way to do both of these extensions 
is  to  make  the  lines  themselves  completely  orthogonal,  thus  creating  a  visual  aide  in 
perceiving three orthogonal dimensions much as we create x, y, and z axes when plotting 
a  point  in  three-dimensions  (it  should  be  noted,  the  dimensions  are  always  orthogonal, 
but  to  create  them,  the  lines  only  need  to  be  non-parallel,  with  one  non-coplanar,  and 
connected once – a moment or two of thought should confirm this). 
 
It  is  interesting  to  note  that  nowhere  does  Euclid  define  addition  and  subtraction.    He 
assumes that these basic functions are known and understood.  However, multiplication is 
specifically defined.  Euclid also represents numbers solely in the context of a line while 
it was apparent that the Pythagoreans represented numbers as figures.12 
 
Thus,  by  the  end  of  the  third  century  BCE,  the  three  spatial  dimensions  as  we  can 
perceive them, were mathematically known and rigorously defined.  Euclidean geometry 
then  remained  the  only  accepted  description  of  the  spatial  universe  until  well  into  the 
Renaissance in the 17th century CE. 
 
There  is  one  aspect  of  Euclid’s  work  that  bedeviled  mathematicians  and  physicists  for 
nearly two millennia.  This is frequently referred to as Euclid’s fifth postulate.  The fifth 
postulate  states  “that  if  a  straight  line  falling  on  two  straight  lines  makes  the  interior 
angles  on  the  same  side  less  than  two  right  angles,  the  two  straight  lines,  if  produced 
indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than the two right angles.”13  
This, it turns out, is the essence of Euclidean geometry.  It assumes a non-curved space in 
all  dimensions.    Every  other  postulate  of  Euclidean  geometry  can  hold  true  on  certain 
surfaces  except  the  fifth  postulate.    Mathematicians  struggled  to  prove  or  disprove  or 
disassociate  this  principle  until  well  into  the  19th  century  when  it  seems  Gauss  was the 
first to accept the possibility of non-Euclidean geometry and, in conjunction with Bolyai 
and  Lobachevski,  showed  through  the  development  of  curved  geometrical  spaces,  that

Euclid’s fifth postulate was indeed independent.14  This opened the door to a vastly new 
way  of  representing  dimensions.    We  will  see  that  this  has  an  important  impact  on  the 
discovery of the dimensions beyond the fourth (time) and third (spatial).  The difficulty in 
proving this postulate also secured Euclid’s legacy for two millennia as dimensions were 
seen  as  completely  flat.    It  should  be  noted  that  Farkas  Bolyai,  a  geometer  in  his  own 
right  and  a  lifelong  friend  of  Gauss,  attempted,  in  vain,  to  stop  his  son  Janos  from 
contemplating this problem, but, luckily, failed in his attempt.15 
 

A Brief Foray into Phase Space 
 
The dimensions described here are limited to actual physical dimensions.  However, the 
use of a mathematical tool called phase space has utilized the concept of a dimension as a 
direction orthogonal to other defined directions in a unique and handy way.  Phase space 
is  defined  as  the  number  of  dimensions  that  can  be  utilized  to  represent  the  state  of  a 
particular system at a given time and is equal to the number of degrees of freedom of the 
that  system.    Frequently  momentum  is  the  quantity  represented  in  addition  to  our 
customary space and time, although, in the first known representation of its kind, in 1698 
by  Varignon,  velocity  was  instead  used  in  place  of  momentum16.    The  important 
distinction  of  phase  space  is  that  it  is  a  useful  mathematical  tool  but  does  not  describe 
dimensions in  the same way used here.  It merely allows for an easier representation of 
the  state  of  a  particular  system  at  a  given  time.    This  is  particularly  useful  in  the 
representation  of  quantum  states  where  momentum  (through  the  uncertainty  principle) 
plays an important role  in the description  of the  given state.   This actually does end up 
playing  an  important role  later  on as we will see that string theory relies heavily on the 
principles  outlined  by  the  uncertainty  principle  and  draws  on  the  fundamentals  of 
quantum mechanics.  However, strictly  speaking, it is not the type of dimension we are 
interested  in.    We  will  pay  close  attention  only  to  those  dimensions  that  are  physical 
actualities and allow the physical transfer of energy in one or two directions within that 
dimension (finding a clear cut definition of a dimension in physics is not an easy task, as 
we  will  see,  particularly  in  the  context  of  temporal  dimensions)  and  that  can  be 
represented in length units alone (this includes temporal dimensions). 
 

Time as a Dimension 
 
The  use  of  time  as  a  dimension  in  mathematical  plots  dates  from  well  before  the  19th 
century.  It was in the latter portion of this century, however, when the use of time as a 
true dimension, able to be represented by a length, and consistent with the previous uses 
of spatial dimensions, was brought to bear.  Actually, for the first representation of time 
as an independent orthogonal coordinate in a four-dimensional space-time, we must look 
to  the  early  20th  century.    In  fact,  Einstein  used  a  purely  algebraic  form  of  math  to 
describe  special  relativity  in  1905.    It  was  not  until  1908  that  time  was  included  as  a

coordinate  in  a  four-dimensional  space-time  by  Minkowski.17    This  gave  rise  to  the 
geometrical  representation  of  relativity  and  led  directly  to  the  development  of  general  
relativity in 1914-16.  It is imperative to remember, however, that until we reach Klein’s 
formation  of  the  fifth  dimension,  we  are  still  in  Euclidean  space-time  which  means  all 
dimensions are still flat. 
 
At  first,  it  is  not  imperative  to  represent  time  in  spatial  units  to  visualize  the  logical 
extension of space to space-time.  However, in order to do any meaningful mathematics, 
it would be desirable to develop some way in which to represent time with the same unit 
measurement  as  space.    Building  on  Einstein’s  postulate  that  the  speed  of  light  is 
invariant  and  universal,  it  can  be  represented  as  a  unitless  number.    The  most  logical 
choice of number in this case is 1.  Therefore, if the speed of light is c then c = 1. 
 
More specifically, the speed of light is defined as: 

 

In order to ensure that this number is unitless, we must represent time spatially.  So, in SI 
units,  applied  to  relativity,  time  is  measured  in  meters.    This  representation  is  often 
referred  to  as  natural  units.  This  allows  us  to  construct  yet  another  useful  tool  in 
relativity: the space-time diagram.  In this diagram, a spatial coordinate (usually x in two 
dimensions)  is  plotted  as  one  axis  with  time  as  the  other,  both  being  represented  in 
natural units as meters: 
 

 

 

In  this  diagram,  the  angles  A and B are both equal to  45°.  This equality represents the 
invariability of the speed of light.  The time and space axes are not always at right angles 
in this diagram but they cannot ‘pass through’ the world-line of light which represents a 
barrier.    The slope of  this line is dt/dx = 1/v.   Given  an event (any single point  on  this

So in brief review, by 1908, we have seen the recognition of four dimensions beginning 
with  Pythagorean  representations  of  two-dimensional  objects  and  properties,  working 
through Euclid’s definitions surrounding three-dimensional objects, and finally reaching, 
over  two  millennia  later,  the  representation  by  Minkowski  and  Einstein  of  time  as  the 
fourth dimension. 
 
It is presumably safe to say that the four dimensions of space and time as presented here, 
represent the limit of human sensory perception.  This limitation is most likely the reason 
that over two thousand years passed between the establishment of the initial three spatial 
dimensions and the addition of the next spatial dimension.  The perception of time as a 
dimension  could  quite  possibly  be  viewed  as  a  concept  behind  its  time.    It  certainly 
contains a sophisticated level of mathematics, but is consistent enough in its linearity that 
it could be considered a mere fluke that it had not been perceived as a dimension by even 
the  Greeks.    Evidence  points  to  its  having  appeared  on  the  same  plot  as  spatial 
coordinates  two-hundred  years  prior  to  Minkowski’s  use  of  time  as  a  coordinate.  
However, ignoring this fact, the limit of human sensory perception can be considered the 
greatest  barrier  that  needed  to  be  overcome  in  order  to  even  conceptualize  higher 
dimensions.  Einstein’s relativity opened the door for this, a lifelong dream of Riemann, 
but  it  was  an  obscure  mathematician  named  Theodor  Kaluza  who  first  mathematically 
developed  the  idea  (Nordstrom  was  also  successful  in  this  effort,  but  has  not  been  the 
beneficiary of a ‘named’ theory in this area). 
 

The Fifth Dimension 
 
We  would  be  remiss,  however,  if  we  do  not  mention  the  fact  that  two  rather  colourful 
scientists  publicly  proposed  the  fifth  dimension  (they  referred  to  it  as  the  fourth 
dimension as Minkowski’s work had yet to be published) less than thirty years prior. 
 

 

8 

In 1877, a bizarre and sensational trial took place in London.  The then renowned psychic 
Henry Slade sat accused of fraud for supposedly deceiving his clients who were some of 
England’s elite.  Quite possibly the most bizarre part of the trial was the fact that several 
prominent  physicists  of  the  time,  including  some  future  Nobel  Prize  winners,  came  to 
Slade’s defense by supporting the notion of a ‘fourth dimension’ (spatially speaking – for 
our  sake,  it  is  the  fifth  dimension).    One  of  these  physicists  was  Johann  Zollner  a 
professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Leipzig.  Zollner enlisted the aide 
of famous physicists William  Crookes,  Wilhelm Weber, J.J. Thompson, Lord Rayleigh, 
and others in an attempt to prove Slade’s innocence.  Slade was ultimately convicted, at 
no  surprise  to  us  (for  we  now  know  the  amount  of  energy  required  to  manipulate  the 
‘fourth  dimension’),  but  Zollner  was  so  convinced  of  the  existence  of  the  ‘fourth 
dimension’ and  its ability  to  be manipulated that he published articles in both scientific 
and pseudo-scientific journals in defense of it.18 
 
In the very same year as the Slade trial, a mathematician named Charles Howard Hinton 
graduated  from  Oxford.    Being  the  son  of  famous  ear  surgeon  and  renowned  bigamist 
James  Hinton,  his  personal  life  began  as  anything  but  dull.    He  eventually  became  a 
bigamist himself, having taken the widow of George Boole (of Boolean algebra fame) as 
his first wife, and Maude Weldon as his second.  Despite his arrest, his first wife, Mary, 
declined to press charges and they both fled to the United States.  It was here that Hinton 
eventually found his way from Princeton to the US Naval Observatory and finally, to the 
place where another great physicist of the time was ‘born:’ the patent office (though not 
the  same  patent  office,  of  course).    Hinton  was  known  as  the  man  who  could  ‘see’  the 
fourth dimension  and  spent his life laboring  to develop ingenious visual descriptions of 
the  fourth  dimension.    These  descriptions  eventually  became  known  as  hypercubes  and 
unraveled hypercubes became known as tesseracts, a term coined by Hinton himself.19 
 
But, despite all this laboring on the part of physicists and mathematicians during the late 
19th  century,  it  was  not  until  after  Einstein  published  his  seminal  work  on  general 
relativity that Theodor Kaluza was able to become to the first to mathematically describe 
the fifth (or fourth spatial) dimension.  
 
Theodor Kaluza was born in 1885 in Ratibor, Germany, now known as Raciborz, Poland, 
eight years after the famous Slade trial.  He was a professor at Königsberg when in 1919 
he  sent  Einstein  a  paper  he  had  been  working  on  that  unified  Einstein’s  relativity  with 
Maxwell’s  theory  of  light.    The  very  means  for  unifying  these  two  theories  was  the 
addition  of  a  fifth  dimension.    What  separated  Kaluza’s  work  from  that  of  Riemann, 
Zollner, and Hinton, was that Kaluza was proposing a true field theory.  He simply wrote 
down Einstein’s field equations in five dimensions.  He then showed that the new five-
dimensional  equations  contained  Einstein’s  four-dimensional  relativity  theory  plus  an 
additional piece.  It turned out the additional piece was exactly Maxwell’s theory of light.  
In  Kaluza’s  original  theory,  all  the  fields  involved  were  independent  of  the  fifth 
dimension.  By starting with pure gravity written in  five dimensions, though independent

of the fifth dimension, the field breaks down to four dimensions which ultimately leaves 
a metric, a Maxwell field, and a scalar.  Kaluza’s major restriction on the fifth dimension 
was  that  it  was  cylindrical  in  form  thus  forcing  it  not  to  appear  in  the  physics  of  the 
problem (i.e. it was a convenient mathematical device, but held little real meaning). 
 
Oskar  Klein  (born  in  1894),  then  professor  at  the  University  of  Michigan,  refined 
Kaluza’s ideas in 1926.  These combined works are now known as Kaluza-Klein theory.  
Klein  did  not  assume  total  independence  of  the  fifth  dimension.    Returning  to  Euclid’s 
fifth postulate, we recall that Gauss, Bolyai, and Lobachevski were the first to prove the 
independence  of  Euclid’s  fifth  postulate.    This  opened  the  door  to  curved  geometries.  
Kaluza had initially employed a cylindrical shape (topology) for his fifth dimension, but 
it  was  still  Euclidean  in  geometry.    Klein  utilized  the  new  idea  of  non-Euclidean 
geometry  and  postulated  that Kaluza’s fifth  dimension  was  actually curved in geometry 
and microscopic in size.  In fact, Klein assumed this dimension would have the topology 
of a circle with the radius on the order of the Planck length (we will see the exact radius 
becomes  important  in  string  theory).    We  can  then  write  the  topology  for  all  five 
dimensions as B4 x S1 where the fifth coordinate, y, is periodic – 0  ≤  my  ≤  2π - and m is 
the inverse radius of the circle.  The periodicity of the extra dimension allows us to make 
a Fourier expansion in this coordinate.  The first order terms of this expansion correspond 
to the reduction initially introduced by Kaluza. 
 
Working  with  the  convention  adopted  by  Derix  and  van  der  Schaar20  we  will  define 
hatted quantities  as being  five-dimensional and  unhatted  quantities as four-dimensional.  
Five dimensional indices will run as:  µˆ  = 0,1,2,3,5 and the four-dimensional indices will 
run as:  µ = 0,1,2,3 (  x

This allows the four-dimensional fields to have the proper transformation characteristics 
in four dimensions.  As developed by Derix and van der Schaar, we must first consider an 
infinitesimal coordinate transformation in five dimensions: 
 

x µˆ → x µˆ  + εξ µˆ ( x µ ) 
 
where  the  transformation  is  independent  of  the  fifth  coordinate.    Given  this  coordinate 
transformation, we can transform the five dimensional metric in the following way:

The  last  term  in  this  equation  is  a  U(1)  gauge  term  and 
µA   has  right  transformation 
properties in four dimensions.  The invariance of general coordinates in five dimensions 
and  the  independence  of  the  fifth  dimension  (still  held  by  Klein  despite  his  topology 
change  from  flat  to  curved)  results  in  gauge  symmetry  of  the  four-dimensional  vector.  
The gauge symmetries become more complicated in four dimensions and are a result of 
more  complicated  compactifications,  which  is  an  important  part  of  string  theory  and 
Calabi-Yau spaces (as we will later see). 
 
The four-dimensional metric and scalar also have the correct transformations:

To develop Kaluza’s idea, we begin with pure gravity, meaning a source-free space-time

those  given  by  Weinberg24  and  Misner,  Thorne,  and  Wheeler25)  from  which  we  can

The  four  dimensional  action  integral  is  far  more  complicated  than  the  five  dimensional

physicists have used the addition of extra dimensions to simplify complex mathematical 
problems, the most important example being string theory.

Derix  and  van  der  Schaar  take  this  a few steps further by deriving a form involving an 
Einstein  term  and  additional  exotic  matter  terms.    They  first  do  this  by  performing  a

A detailed construction of the action for gravitational fields is contained in Chapter 12 of 
Weinberg.26    In  this  way,  we  see  that  by  adding  a  curled-up  fifth  dimension,  Klein, 
building  on  Kaluza’s  initial  work,  succeeded  in  unifying  electromagnetism  and  gravity.  
Apparently,  the  scalar  in  the  action  was  considered  a  bit  of  an  embarrassment  in  the 
1920’s,  but  in  recent  years  Kaluza-Klein  theory  has  experienced  a  revival  as  the 
expanding  notions  of  string  theory  have  created  a  need  for  defining  actions  in  higher 
dimensions.    It  is  interesting  to  note  that  not  only  did  Kaluza  and  Klein  succeed  in 
unifying  electromagnetism  and  gravity,  but  matter  and  geometry  as  well,  as  the  photon 
appeared in four dimensions as a manifestation of empty five-dimensional space-time.27

The Fifth Dimension Revisited 
 
In  recent  years,  the  concept  of  five-dimensional  gravity  has  been  revisited  by  a 
consortium of researchers led by Paul Wesson at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, 
Canada.  The consortium also includes members of Stanford University’s Gravity Probe-
B  program.28    The  major  difference  is  that  in  the  consortium’s  research,  the  fifth 
dimension is not compactified.  The result of this is that new terms enter into the physics, 
even  at  low  energies.    In  standard  four  dimensional  space-time,  these  terms  appear  as 
matter  and  energy.    By  moving  them  to  the  right-hand  side  of  the  four  dimensional 
equations they provide an induced energy-momentum tensor.  According to Wesson, they 
have shown that, in fact, no five dimensional energy-momentum tensor is required.  The 
results can include new forms of matter ultimately uniting gravity with its source, as well 
as with other fields. 
 
An interesting point that Overduin and Wesson have shown is that should φ be constant 
, the result is a Brans-Dicke-type 
and the electromagnetic potential be set to zero, 
scalar field theory.  The resulting metric can be written as: 
 

0=µA

=





ˆ
g AB




 
Combining  this  with  the  field  equations  and  Kaluza’s  assumptions,  the  action  integral 
becomes:

Compare this with equation 12.  Neglecting the constant in front of the integral (as Derix 
and van der Schaar have done), and making the assumptions we have made with regard to 
the potential, A, and φ, we see that equation 14 is a direct result of equation 12 (we show 
this to merely bridge the methods of Derix & van der Schaar and Overduin & Wesson – 
and we should also note that  µνF  ∝  µA  which allows us to drop the last term in equation 
12)29. 
 
Overduin and Wesson show, through a Kaluza-Klein ansatz metric, that for the metric to 
satisfy Einstein’s equations in 4+d dimensions, the Killing vectors must be independent 
of the extra coordinate, which means that the compact manifold is flat.  Ultimately, they 
  must  also  be  flat.30    So  we  flip-flop  from  “Kleinian”  assumptions  to 
µνgˆ
show  that 
  Conventional  compactification  models  require  either  that  the  extra

such  as  torsion  or  higher-derivative  terms.    This  is  where  Overduin  and  Wesson  begin 
laying the groundwork for a non-compactified five-dimensional theory. 
 
The  groundwork  for  their  development  is  the  dependence  of  physical  quantities  on  the 
fifth  coordinate.    This  is  something  we  have  not  seen  as  yet  in  our  development  of  the 
fifth  dimension.    This  dependence  is  precisely  what  produces  the  electromagnetic 
radiation as well  as  a  general  form of matter  from geometry via the higher-dimensional 
field  equations.31    One  of  the  interesting  outcomes  of  this  research  is  that  it  ultimately 
becomes  a  more  easily  testable  theory.    The  compactified  dimensions  of  Klein  are  not 
necessarily  lengthlike  in  nature,  but  the  new  non-compactified  dimensions,  with  the 
cylindrical condition removed, can be represented as lengthlike.  Another point of interest 
is  that  previous  authors  have  maintained  Klein’s  mechanism  of  harmonic  expansion 
which  means  the  compact  manifold  must  have  finite  volume.    With  non-compactified 
dimensions, no such requirement exists.   
 
Overduin and Wesson thus write the metric as: 
 

ˆ(

2 =ε

 
The  ε term is introduced to allow for a timelike as well as a spacelike signature for the 
.  Please note that there is a difference between 
fifth dimension requiring only that 
timelike and temporal here.  Having a timelike signature does not mean the dimension is 
necessarily  temporal  (and  thus  non-causal).    Time  has  rarely  been  considered  in 
compactified  dimensions  due  to  a  variety  of  problems  that  arise  from  its  inclusion.  
However, in non-compactified theories, some of these problems vanish.

Equations  17  through  20  form  the  basis  for  the  non-compactified  five  dimensional 
Kaluza-Klein theory developed by Overduin and Wesson.32  The physical meaning of the 
components of these equations as well as their application to cosmology and astrophysics 
are discussed in depth in their paper.  Their results can be compared to those derived by 
Derix  and  van  der  Schaar.    The  non-compactified  equations  are  more  complicated,  and 
this has been an overriding motivation for compactification in the past, but the physical 
significance of the non-compactified equations is interesting to note (again, see Overduin 
and Wesson33 as well as other reports from the consortium34). 
 

Classical String Theory 
 
In order to more fully understand the next dimensional jump, it is necessary to digress for 
a  moment  into  explaining  some  of  the  underlying  methods  of  classical  string  theory, 
which  primarily  deals  with,  at  least  here,  bosonic  strings.    To  fully  understand  string 
theory,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  quantum  field  theory  as  modern  string  theory  is 
simply a theory of quantum gravity.  In addition, the mathematics of string theory can get 
phenomenally complex.  In the interest of brevity, a few choice topics and equations will 
be presented in an attempt to give the flavor of string theory as a basis for moving into 
higher dimensional analysis.

String  theory  is  a  relatively  recent  phenomenon.    The  first  hint  at its existence  came  in 
1968  when  Gabriele  Veneziano  at  CERN  in  Geneva  needed  a  solution  to  a  vexing 
problem he was working on at the time.  Surprisingly, he found he was able to use a little-
used purely mathematical tool developed by Leonard Euler nearly 200 years before called 
the Euler beta-function.  The solution however lacked some sense of physical meaning or 
justification – i.e. no one was certain as to why it worked.  However, two years later, the 
concept  of  strings  was developed in the  works of  Yoichiro  Nambu of  the University  of 
Chicago,  Holger  Nielsen  of  the  Niels  Bohr  Institute,  and  Leonard  Susskind  of  Stanford 
University  and  the  physical  meaning  to  Veneziano’s  problem  was  introduced.    Nambu, 
Neilsen, and Susskind postulated that zero-dimensional point-particles were actually one-
dimensional vibrating strings (thus instantaneously adding an additional dimension to the 
mix, at least in theory).  They showed that the nuclear interactions of particles modeled as 
these strings  were  exactly described using the Euler beta-function.35  The resonances of 
the vibrating strings determines the masses of the point particles we observe in nature. 
 
Unfortunately,  string  theory  sat  dormant  for  over  a  decade  due  to  inconsistencies  and 
problems  in  some  of  the  predictions.    In  1984, John Schwarz of Cal Tech and  Michael 
Green  of  Queen  Mary  College  launched  what  is  now  known  as  “the  first  superstring 
revolution.”    During  this  three  year  period,  from  1984  through  1986,  more  than  one-
thousand  research  papers  were  published  on  the  subject.36    Even  in  its  initial  form, 
superstring theory was able to unite the four forces in nature as well as matter.  As a note, 
the “super” in superstring comes from the incorporation of supersymmetry into the theory 
(which has profound implications on the length scale of the actual strings as we will see 
in  coming  sections).    For  now,  let  us  delve  into  a  bit  of  the  basics  of  classical  string 
theory. 
 
As  we  stated  earlier,  the  concept  of  a  string  in  its  most  basic  form  is  that  of  a  zero-
dimensional  point-particle  magnified  to  such  an  extent  that  it  is  actually  a  one-
dimensional  vibrating  string.    Initially  we  will  consider  this  string  to  be  a  closed  loop 
(there  are  other  string  theories  that  will  be  discussed  shortly  that  include  non-closed 
loops).  Just as a point particle draws out a worldline as it travels in space-time, a string 
sweeps  out  a  world-sheet  –  one-dimension  higher  than  a  worldline.    In  this  way, 
construction of a space-time diagram becomes more complicated.  As such,  h = c = 1 are 
not natural units for strings (mass has the unit of inverse length).  Additional introduced 
quantities include a new coupling constant in the form of a string tension, T, which has 
the  units  of  (
  when  h =  c  =  1  which  then  introduces  a  characteristic  length 
squared, 
.    Being 
ultimately  a  theory  of  quantum  gravity,  this  length  must  be  on  the  order  of  the  Planck 
, which is the only length that can be constructed from G,  h , and c.

Brian Hatfield has a detailed discussion of the units and scales of strings in Chapter 21 of 
his book.37 
 
Strings also happen to be Wilson loops which are closed strings (of glu) of infinitesimal 
width.  This model for strings goes back to its original development in the 1970’s when it 
was used to describe properties in hadron physics.  The strings were the gluons holding 
the bound quark states together to form hadrons.  This led to work on developing QCD 
and Yang-Mills as string theories of Wilson loops. 
 
If  all  point-particles  are  indeed  strings,  there  would  presumably  be  a  string  interaction 
here  between  the  quarks  and  the  gluons,  both  actually  being  strings.    The  oddly 
fascinating part of string theory is that when strings interact they simply produce another 
string  which  is,  geometrically,  though  not  necessarily  topologically,  the  same  as  the 
strings  that  formed  it.    In  this  way  we  have  no  way  of  telling  if  a  particular  string  was 
formed  as  a  result  of  interactions  simply  by  looking  at  it.    The  benefit  of  this  is  that 
standard perturbation theory is trivial since it really only would describe the topology of 
the new string.  In addition, we are unable to detect exactly where a sting interaction has 
occurred as it will look different in two Lorentz frames.38 
 
For given string theories there exists a maximum allowable space-time dimension beyond 
which  the  theory  ultimately  breaks  down.    The  critical  dimension  is  determined  by  the 
number  of  local  supersymmetries  on  the  string’s  world-sheet.    If  absolutely  no 
supersymmetry is present, the critical dimension is D = 26.  This is the maximum number 
of  existing  dimensions  proposed  by  any  string  theory.    It  was  in  fashion  as  a  possible 
solution for several years but, as we will see, Witten’s “second superstring revolution” in 
1995 may have doused that option.  For 1 supersymmetry, the critical dimension is D = 
10.  This was the most widely accepted theory until Witten’s revolution in 1995 and still 
forms the basis of D = 11 theory.  It is also the theory that we will be focusing on it our 
brief glimpse at classical string theory.

Compare  the  results  of  the  action  integrals  of  these  topological  defects  to  equations  12 
and  14,  the  action  integrals  for  the  five-dimensional  systems  of  Kaluza-Klein  theory.  
(Keep  in  mind  the  actions  here  are  describing  paths  of  particles  and  strings  while  the 
Kaluza-Klein  actions  describe  a  field).    A  cursory  comparison  shows  that  one  of  the 
major introductions to the string action is the string tension, T.  However, we should note 
that by once again expanding from a zero-dimensional point-particle up one dimension to 
a one-dimensional string we get an equation (24) that is suspiciously similar to equation 
14, the Overduin and Wesson action integral. 
 

Supergravity and Superstrings: 10 or 11 dimensions? 
 
In  expanding  beyond  five  dimensions,  we  actually  explode  into  more  than  double  that.  
This  is  based  on  the  critical  dimension  we  mentioned  in  the  previous  section.    String 
theory got “stuck in the mud” for many years, in particular in the early 1990’s, within a 
maze of infinities and other odd problems including the lack of a consensus on the value 
of the critical dimension.  In 1995, however, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced 
Study  in  Princeton,  New  Jersey,  presented  a  seminal  lecture  at  the  Strings  1995 
conference  at  USC  that  launched  the  “second  superstring  revolution.”    The  meat  of  his 
lecture showed that a minimum of 11 dimensions was required for a Kaluza-Klein theory 
to  unify  all  of  the  forces  in the standard  model  of particle physics  (namely  it contained 
the  gauge  groups  of  the  strong  and  electroweak  interactions).    Prior  to  this,  11  was 
precisely  the  same  number  of  dimensions  determined  by  Nahm  to  be  a  maximum  for 
consistency  with,  none  other  than,  the  graviton  (with  a  maximum  of  spin  2)!40    So,  it 
seems, the unification of the four forces of nature necessarily required 11 dimensions!  In 
fact, there were even more conditions that were discovered to apply that fixed the critical 
dimension at 11.  In addition, the four dimensions of the visible world split out perfectly 
from the total 11 leaving 7 compactified or non-physical dimensions in its wake. 
 
The supergravity concept  was developed to add the extra matter fields to the equations.  
The  easiest  way  to  do  this  was  to  make  the  theory  supersymmetric  which  means  every

boson  has  some,  as  yet  undiscovered,  fermionic  superpartner.    This  very  development 
poses  an  enormous  barrier  to  the  experimental  verification  of  string  theory,  however.  
Obtaining  the  energy  levels  necessary  to  produce  these  supermassive  superpartners  in a 
laboratory is well beyond our current reach.  This isn’t the only problem with the D = 11 
supergravity theory.  One major problem that turned up is that the compact manifolds did 
not  produce  quarks  and  leptons.    Several  other  issues  involving  chirality  and  a  rather 
large cosmological constant also arise. 
 
The  real  breakthrough  came  with  the  development  of  two  separate  ten-dimensional 
supergravity models that were able to solve the anomaly problems while also maintaining 
the uniqueness that the eleven dimensional theory held (the minimum/maximum critical 
dimension  issues).    These  two  theories  were  based  on  the  groups  SO(32)  and 
.  
The extra terms that needed to be added corresponded to those that appeared naturally in 
low-energy  superstring  theory.    The  first  sign  of  trouble  with  these  two  theories  is  that 
they predicted five separate string theories between them.  However, Witten has proposed 
an entirely new theory  called M-theory  (M for  membrane) that unites the five complete 
string  theories  along  with  supergravity  under  one  umbrella:  Type  I  (the  bosonic  string 
theory we looked at in the previous section), Type IIA, Type IIB, Heterotic-O (
),

), and D = 11 supergravity.  Details of this unification depend on the 

Duality and M-Theory 
 
Duality  was  really  the  essence  of  Witten’s  lecture  at  Strings  1995.    The  idea  behind 
duality  is  that  a  singular  physical  system  can  be  described  by  two  seemingly  separate 
theories.  More to the point, it’s like looking at a house from the front and then from the 
back.    Initially  there  might  be  no  indication  that  you’re  actually  looking  at  one-in-the-
same house when, in fact, further research eventually proves it is indeed one house.  One 
fantastically interesting application of duality in physics is that when shrinking down to 
the scale of the Planck length while looking at a circular dimension of radius R, once we 
pass  through  the  Planck  length  we  find  that  the  physics  described  by  the  system  with 
radius 1/R is precisely the same as that described by the radius R.  Therefore, essentially, 
 m is 
the universe at sub-Planck scales on the order of say something as absurd as 
10 −
exactly the same as the universe at 1/
 m (which is huge).  So we see that the Planck 
length  mirrors  us  back  outward  if  we  try  to  continue  to  probe  to  smaller  lengths,  all 
thanks to the introduction of duality.  This means that there is an exact lower limit to the 
size of compactified dimensions – the Planck length (radial in this example). 
 
Another interesting artifact of duality is the fact that the exact shape of the compactified 
dimensions  (taking  the  form  of  a  Calabi-Yau  space  as  we  will  see)  is  not  necessarily 
important.  Two completely different shapes can produce the exact same physics.  Witten 
used  this  idea  to  develop M-Theory, proposing that  the different superstring theories as 
well as D = 11 supergravity were all portions of the same theory that appeared different 
simply  on  the  surface  but,  thanks  to  duality,  described  exactly  the  same  physics.    To 
couple the various theories to each other and to M-Theory as a whole, dualities have been

employed  to  show  that  Type  I  and  Heterotic-O  are  coupled,  while  Heterotic-O  is  also 
coupled to Heterotic-E which is coupled to M-Theory’s core, which is coupled to Type-
IIA which is coupled to Type-IIB which is finally coupled to itself.  More work is being 
performed in this area in an effort to unite supergravity and also to more clearly develop 
the exact form of M-Theory.  Of particular interest to us in regard to this paper is what all 
this has to say about the extra dimensions it offers us. 
 

Traversable Dimensions and F-Theory 
 
In  superstring  theory  the  extra  7  dimensions  are  compactified  into  a  complex  set  of 
shapes that is dictated by the equations of the theory.  It turns out the geometrical shapes 
dictated by string theory satisfied a previously known set of geometrical spaces known as 
Calabi-Yau  spaces  (after  Eugenio  Calabi  of  the  University  of  Pennsylvania  and  Shing-
Tung  Yau  of  Harvard  University).    The  mathematics  of  Calabi-Yau  shapes  is  quite 
complex and a visual representation of 7 spatial dimensions on a sheet of paper is quite 
complicated (though, see Greene41 page 207 for a reasonable approximation) so we will 
not delve deeper into them here.  As we stated in the previous section, duality allows for 
a veritable zoo of Calabi-Yau shapes that ultimately describe the exact same physics. 
 
The  physics  described  by  Calabi-Yau  spaces  in  string  theory  is  actually  indirectly 
experimentally  testable.    As  we  stated  earlier,  the  resonances  of  the  vibrating  strings 
determines  the  masses  of  the  elementary  particles  in  physics.    The  strings  are  free  to 
vibrate in virtually any direction in the spatially extended dimensions and can also vibrate 
within  the  compactified  dimensions.    However,  when  vibrating  in  the  compactified 
dimensions, the precise nature of the Calabi-Yau space describing the higher dimensions 
constrains the motion of the vibrating string.  So in understanding the precise Calabi-Yau 
spatial  geometry  of  a  particular  manifold,  additional  constraints  can  be  placed  on  the 
strings making it theoretically easier to determine the precise physical nature of the string 
– e.g. the mass and charge of the particle it describes.  Physicists consider this to be one 
of the most far-reaching and profoundly insightful facts of string theory.  Additional work 
by  Andrew  Strominger  and  others  allowed  for  the  slight  modification  of  this  theory  to 
solve the problem of  collapsing dimensions.   In this theory,  a  one-dimensional string is 
called a one-brane and can completely surround a one-dimensional piece of space.  If this 
one-dimensional  string  is  blown  up  like  an  inner-tube  or  a  tire  it  becomes  two-
dimensional  and  is  called  a  two-brane.    A  two-brane  can  completely  surround  a  two-
dimensional piece of space.  One can easily see where this is heading.  The idea is that by 
surrounding  the  extra  spatial  dimensions  with  a  brane  (a  multi-dimensional  string)  the 
cataclysmic effects of collapse can be blocked.42 
 
Based on these concepts, the compactified dimensions are traversable by strings, but not 
by anything larger.  So technically to us the extra dimensions are not traversable.  Objects 
on  the  order  of  a  point-particle  (as  we  see  them)  and  larger  can  only  traverse  the  four 
non-compactified  dimensions.    The  nature  of  these  dimensions is not as well  known  as 
we  think.    The  precise  nature  of  the  Euclidean  spatial  dimensions  appears locally  to  be

flat,  though  general  relativity  has  shown  that  the  manifold  of  these  three  dimensions 
along with time can be bent and warped in the presence of gravity.  On a larger scale the 
precise shape of the universe has a profound effect on the ultimate shape of the Euclidean 
dimensions.  Technically speaking the most interesting case would be a closed universe 
in  which  the  Euclidean  dimensions  eventually  bent  back  on  themselves  (legitimate 
physicists have recently suggested this could be possible43).  Unfortunately for those who 
find this notion romantic, a recent paper by P. De Bernardis, et. al. in the journal Nature 
based  on  balloon  research  in  Antarctica  has  shown  that  the  universe  is  indeed  flat 
(Euclidean - at least for now). 
 
The  fifth  dimension  as  described  by  the  original  Kaluza-Klein  theory  would  not  be 
traversable  except  possibly  by  vibrating  strings.    However,  the  new  non-compactified 
fifth  dimension  as  proposed  by  Wesson’s  consortium  might  allow  for  a  fifth  fully 
traversable  dimension.    Whether  this dimension is  truly Euclidean as well  based on the 
recent observations of De Bernardis, et. al. would need to be probed. 
 
Standard  traversable  Euclidean  dimensions  have  two  degrees  of  physical  freedom.    To 
our  knowledge,  temporal  dimensions  do  not.    Based  on  standard  causal-based  physics, 
the only time dimension that we are aware of has a single degree of freedom – forward.  
Science  fiction  writers and some physicists have speculated  that time travel  is possible.  
An  extensive  base  of  scientific  research  has  been  performed  on  wormholes,  some  of 
which  suggests  the  possibility  of time travel, though  the research has  taken this to  be a 
useful  mathematical  tool  rather  than  speculating  on  its  actual  physical  existence  (see 
Visser for a detailed look at current wormhole research and the mathematical foundations 
for  theoretical  time  travel44).    M.J.  Duff  of  the  University  of  Michigan  began  his 
compilation  on  string  theory  with  the  following  quote  from  Mother  Goose:  “Nature 
requires  five,  Custom  allows  seven,  Idleness  takes  nine,  And  wickedness  eleven.”    The 
appropriateness  of  this  quote  became  apparent  when  Cumrun  Vafa  of  Harvard  in 
February of 1996 first suggested F-Theory (building on work by a number of others – for 
a  very  interesting  and  detailed  overview  of  F-Theory,  David  R.  Morrison  at  Duke,  a 
leading  string  theorist  and  F-Theorist,  has  archived  six  lectures  on  RealVideo  on  his 
website45).  In this theory, the 11 dimensions of M-Theory are extended to 12 in order to 
solve  a  few  select  problems  inherent  in  M-Theory.    The  interesting  thing  is  that  this 
additional dimension is temporal.  Immediately, the mere philosophical implications are 
staggering  if  there  is  physical  fact  lying  behind  the  mathematics.    But,  for  now,  let’s 
remain  with  the  idea  that  there  is  a  single  degree  of  freedom  in  all  possible  temporal 
dimensions combined and simply say that F-Theory is a convenient mathematical tool. 
 

Creation and Conclusion 
 
One final point in discussing this dizzying array of dimensions is to briefly mention how 
they formed.  At some point a few fractions of a second after the Big Bang, spontaneous 
symmetry  breaking  occurred  causing  the  non-compactified  dimensions  to  expand  while

the  compactified  ones  curled  up  into  a  Calabi-Yau  “ball.”    This  was  a  result  of  the 
presence  of  a  tremendous  amount  of  tension  that,  when  released  during  the  symmetry 
breaking, caused the dimensions to “snap into position.”  Whether these dimensions will 
be  united  at  some  time  in  the  tremendously  distant  future  is  of  course  unknown.    But 
what  we  have  learned  over  the  last  two  millennia  (a  short  time,  in  perspective)  is 
tremendous.    We  have  slowly  developed,  dimension  by  dimension,  a  world  of  multiple 
dimensions,  some  seen,  some  unseen.    The  implications of the physics and topology of 
these dimensions are far reaching and years of research are still ahead of us.  Ultimately, 
the reward should be well worth the hunt but “only time will tell…”

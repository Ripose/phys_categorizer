Abstract: Raman spectroscopies are carried out by the Method polarizable examinations of 
the lattice oscillations of p-chloronitrobenzene at temperature 293 K. The led matching of spectrums 
of  p-chloronitrobenzene  with  p-bromochlorobenzene  and  p-dibromobenzene  has  shown  that  the 
significant  line  broadening  in  p-chloronitrobenzene  is  caused  not  only  clutter  in  allocation  of 
molecules  concerning  parasubstitution  benzol.  It  is  necessary  to  consider  also  and  clutter  in 
rotational  displacements  of  the  nitro  of  group  concerning  a  plane  of  a  molecule.  Calculations  of 
frequency spectra were led on a method the Dyne.

 As  have  shown  scalings  the

of  frequencies  is  observed  for  lines

of  frequencies  has  made  from  3  up  to

The  value  of  this  scatter  will  already 
agree with experimental data.

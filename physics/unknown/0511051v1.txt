Abstract 

 
investigate  the  conditions  under  which  computer 
programs  represent  correctly,  in    polar  coordinates,  the  relativistic  transformation 
equations for the space-time coordinates of the  same event. 

 
 
 
 
 
Special  relativity  works  with  transformation  equations.  They  establish  a 
relationship  between  the  space-time  coordinates  of  the  same  event,  measured  by 
observers  of  the  inertial  reference  frames  in  relative  motion  K(XOY)  and 
K’(X’O’Y’). K is the stationary reference frame, K’ is the moving reference and all 
conditions are met top be in the standard arrangement.  
 
A transformation equation presents in its left side a space coordinate of an 
event measured in K. In its right side it presents the space and the time coordinates 
of the same event as measured in K’ and the relative velocity V  of K’ relative to K. 
The space coordinates could be Cartesian (x,y in K and x’,y’ in K’) or polar (r,θ in 
K and  θ′
 in K’). In many, cases we use transformation equations that present, in 
both  their  sides,  physical  quantities  measured  in  the  same  reference  frame.  The 
computer becomes useful when we establish a relationship between the space-time 
coordinates  of  events  that  take  place  on  a  given  profile  at  rest  say  in K’  and  the 
space-time coordinates as detected from K relative to which the profile moves with 
constant velocity V = β•c (where β = 0.8 in our paper).

If the detected profile is the circle 
 
 
 
  represent  its  photographed 
then  relativists  consider  that  (1)  and  (2)  with 
shape  from  K  in  a  parametric  representation  whereas  (3)  and  (4)  represent  its 
photographed shape in a polar representation. 
All the formulas from above describe some geometrical transformation and 
 
a good (easy to use and accurate) visualization tool is needed. There are many such 
tools, known under the generic name of Computer Algebra Systems: huge collections 
of  mathematical  algorithms  which  combine  exact  symbolic  manipulation, 
approximate  numerical  calculation  and  high  quality  graphical  representation.  Our 
paper  use  Mathematica  5.2  but  Maple,  Matworks  or  Mathcad  produces 
essentially the same results.  

The CAS starts to work. Making it to represent the circle (6), to perform 
the  parametric  representation  (1)  and  (2)  and  the  polar  representation  (5),  it 
displays on the screen of the computer the same result presented in Figure 1. The 
command is: 

Figure 1. Both parametric and polar plots lead to the same result. 

 

To perform polar representation, the standard  mathematica kernel is not 

sufficient and so it  calls the graphical package: `Graphics`. The command is: 
 
 

 

 
This comand leads to  result  shown in Figure 1. 

Performing the polar representation  of the circle and of (3) it displays on 

the screen the result shown in Figure 2 that is in total disagreement with the

previous  results  and  with  the  physics  of  the  problem  mainly  because  it  does  not 
 as required by the relativistic 
 and 
present horizontal tangents for 
invariance of distances measured perpendicular to the direction of relative motion.

It is not a CAS error but a human one: Mathematica represents in that case r as a 
function of θ′. Figure (3) we present the way in which θ depends on 

.θ′

The  pedagogical  moral  for  the  beginner  is  that  CAS  performs  polar 
coordinate  representations  in  accordance  with  special  relativity  only  in  the  case 
when  we  express  the  curves  as  a  function  of  physical  quantities  measured  in  the 
same  reference  frame,  proper  physical  quantities  and  the  relative  velocity  of  the 
two frames.

ikj = 0.

Meanwhile, the subtraction is inadmissible on principle because an addition of any construction,
including, for example, ˜T ik = ∂lψikl, ψi(kl) = 0, to an energy-momentum tensor of concrete matter
corresponds to a local change of matter. And what is more, the addition of ∂lψikl can change the
total 4-momentum and angular 4-momentum of a system. For example, it is easy to express the
energy-momentum tensor of an uniform ball of radius R in the form ˜T ik = ∂lψikl:

ψ00α = −ψ0α0 = ǫxα/3 (r < R), ψ00α = −ψ0α0 = ǫR3xα/3r3

(r > R)

give

˜T 00 = −ǫ

(r < R),

˜T 00 = 0 (r > R), α = 1, 2, 3.

Obviously, an addition of this construction changes the total 4-momentum.

Nevertheless, the authors of all textbooks on the theory of ﬁelds repeat the same mistake. As an

example I quote here from Landau and Lifshitz [1] using our notations.

“It is necessary to point out that the deﬁnition of the (energy-momentum) tensor T ik is not

unique. in fact, if T ik is deﬁned by

then any other tensor of the form

will also satisfy equation

∂T ik/∂xk = 0,
(32.4)
since we have identically ∂2ψikl/∂xk∂xl = 0. The total four-momentum of the system does not
change, since... we can write

∂ψikl

were the integral on the right side of the equation is extended over the (ordinary) surface which
‘bond’ the hypersurface over which the integration on the left is taken. This surface is clearly located
at inﬁnity in the three-dimensional space, and since neither ﬁeld nor particles are present at inﬁnity
this integral is zero. Thus the fore-momentum of the system is, as it must be, a uniquely determined
quantity.”

But it seems to be incorrect.

ψikldakl = 0, only if ψikl decreases on inﬁnity rather quickly. I

present a three-dimensional analogy concerning an electric current I and its magnetic ﬁeld H αβ:

Varying the electrodynamics action integral with respect to a metric tensor in the Minkowski
space, one can obtain the Minkowski energy-momentum tensor which is called the metric energy-
momentum tensor. But, in our opinion, it is a happy accident, because it is impossible to obtain, for

2

example, a spin tensor by varying an action integral with respect to a torsion or contortion tensor.
It cannot be done either for electromagnetic ﬁeld or for a ﬁeld which obviously has spin in the
Minkowski space. It is a consequence of the fact, that the torsion and contortion tensors are equal
to zero in Minkowski space and even in a Riemann space (unlike gik). As appear, the variational
principle is not capable to give a true spin tensor in a Riemann space.

So we are not sure, that varying an action integral in U4 space (with a torsion) one can obtain
true energy-momentum and spin tensors as it is aﬃrmed, for example, in [2]. In any case it is obvious
that a metric (symmetric) and a canonical energy-momentum tensors will be essentially diﬀerent.

In electrodynamics the elimination of spin tensor leads to a strange opinion that a circularly
polarized plane wave with inﬁnite extent can have no angular momentum [3], that only a quasiplane
wave of ﬁnite transverse extend carries an angular momentum whose direction is along the direction
of propagation. This angular momentum is provided by an outer region of the wave within which
the amplitudes of the electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds are decreasing. These ﬁelds have components
parallel to wave vector there, and the energy ﬂow has components perpendicular to the wave vector.
“This angular momentum is the spin of the wave” [4]. Within an inner region the E and B ﬁelds are
perpendicular to the wave vector, and the energy-momentum ﬂow is parallel to the wave vector [5].
But let us suppose now that a circularly polarized beam is absorbed by a round ﬂat target which
is divided concentrically into outer and inner parts. According to the previous reasoning, the inner
part of the target will not perceive a torque. Nevertheless R. Feynman [6] clearly showed how a
circularly polarized plane wave transfers a torque to an absorbing medium. What is true? And if R.
Feynman is right, how one can express the torque in terms of pondermotive forces?

From our point of view, classical electrodynamics is not complete. The task is to discover the

nonzero spin tensor of electromagnetic ﬁeld.

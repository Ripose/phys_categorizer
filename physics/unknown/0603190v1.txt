Abstract – Limited diffraction beams are a class of waves that may be localized in space and time. 
Theoretically, these beams are propagation invariant and can propagate to an infinite distance without 
spreading.  In  practice,  when  these  beams  are  produced  with  wave  sources  of  a  finite  aperture  and 
energy,  they  have  a  very  large  depth  of  field,  meaning  that  they  can  keep  a  small  beam  width  over  a 
large  distance.  Because  of  this  property,  limited  diffraction  beams  may  have  applications  in  various 
areas  such  as  medical  imaging  and  tissue  characterization.  In  this  paper,  fundamentals  of  limited 
diffraction  beams  are  reviewed  and  the  studies  of  these  beams  are  put  into  a  unified  theoretical 
framework. Theory of limited diffraction beams is further developed. New limited diffraction solutions 
to  Klein-Gordon  Equation  and  Schrodinger  Equation,  as  well  as  limited  diffraction  solutions  to  these 
equations in confined spaces are obtained. The relationship between the transformation that converts any 
-dimensional 
solutions to an (
equation and the Lorentz transformation is clarified and extended. The transformation is also applied to 
the Klein-Gordon Equation. In addition, applications of limited diffraction beams are summarized.

I. INTRODUCTION  

One  type  of  limited  diffraction  beams  was  first  described  by  Stratton  as  “undistorted  progressive 
waves”  (UPW)  in  his  book  in  1941  [1].  In  1987,  without  referring  to  Stratton’s  work,  Durnin  et  al. 
studied the UPWs with both computer simulation and an optical experiment [2]-[4]. Because the UPWs 
in Stratton’s book have a Bessel transverse beam profile, they are termed Bessel beams. Durnin et al. 
have  named  the  Bessel  beams  “nondiffracting  beams”  or  “diffraction-free”  beams  [2]-[4].  Because 
Durnin’s  terminologies  are  controversial  in  scientific  community,  these  beams  are  termed  “limited 
diffraction  beams”  [5]  since  all  practical  beams  or  waves  will  eventually  diffract.  Bessel  beams  are 
localized  in  transverse  direction  and  may  have  potential  applications  [6]-[14].  In  acoustics,  the  first 
Bessel annular array transducer was designed and constructed in 1990 [15]-[16], and patented in 1992 
[17]. The applications of Bessel beams in acoustics were also studied extensively [18]-[30].  

Localized waves (LWs) were first developed by Brinttingham in 1983 and were termed focus wave 
modes  [31].  LWs  have  similar  properties  as  Bessel  beams  in  terms  of  transverse  localization.  In 
addition, LWs contain multiple frequencies and may be localized in the axial direction. LWs have been 
studied by many investigators [32]-[40]. However, LWs are not propagation invariant, i.e., they do not 
meet the propagation-invariant condition as defined in the following: If one travels with the wave at a

To  find  multiple  frequency  waves  that  are  propagation  invariant,  i.e., 

,  in 
1991,  X  waves  were  developed  [41]-[43]  and  were  subsequently  studied  [44]-[54].  The  name,  “X 
waves”,  was  used  because  the  beam  profile  in  the  axial  cross-section  (a  plane  through  the  beam  axis) 
resembles  the  letter  “X”.  Due  to  the  interest  of  X  waves  in  nonlinear  optics  and  other  applications,  X 
waves were introduced in the “Search and Discovery” column of Physics Today in 2004 [55]. The two 
1992 X wave papers [42]-[43] were awarded by the Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control 
(UFFC)  Society  of  the  Institutes  of  Electrical  and  Electronics  Engineers  (IEEE)  in  1993.  Later,  an  X 
wave experiment in optics was performed by Saari and Reivelt and was published in 1997 in Physical

-1)-
diffraction  beams  (including  X  waves)  in  an 
dimensional  isotropic/homogeneous  wave  equation  was  developed  in  1995 
  is  an 
integer. This formula has been related to part of the Lorentz transformation 
[57]-[58], and was used and 
demonstrated by other researchers [59]-[60]. Furthermore, an X wave transform that is a transformation 
pair  was  developed  in  2000  for  any  physically  realizable  waves  using  the  orthogonal  property  of  X 
waves [46]-[47]. The orthogonal property of X waves was further  studied by Salo et al. in 2001 [61]. 
The transformation pair allows one to decompose an arbitrary physically realizable wave into X waves 
(inverse  X  wave  transform)  and  determine  the  coefficients  (forward  X  wave  transform)  of  the 
decomposition. Based on the X wave theory, a method and its extension that are capable of an ultra high 
frame  rate  (HFR)  two-dimensional  (2D)  or  three-dimensional  (3D)  imaging  were  developed  in  1997 
[62]-[82]. Due to the importance of this method, it was noted as one of the predictions of the 21st century 
medical ultrasonics in 2000 [83]. After the introduction of X waves in 1991 [41]-[43], these waves have 
been studied extensively by many investigators [56], [58]-[60], [84]-[118]. There are also some review 
papers on X waves and their applications [119]-[126].  

In this paper, fundamentals of limited diffraction beams are reviewed and the studies of these beams 
are put into a unified theoretical framework. Theory of limited diffraction beams is further developed. 
New  limited  diffraction  solutions  to  Klein-Gordon  Equation  and  Schrodinger  Equation,  as  well  as 
limited diffraction solutions to these equations in confined spaces are obtained. The relationship between

applications of limited diffraction beams are summarized.

where  the  subscript  “ nB ”  means  n th-order  Bessel  beam,  α  is  a  scaling  parameter, 
order Bessel function of the first kind, and 
 is the phase velocity of the wave. It is clear that 
/
Bessel  beams  are  single-frequency  waves  and  are  localized  in  transverse  direction.  The  scaling 
parameter,  α,  determines  the  degree  of  localization.  Because  of  this  property,  Bessel  beams  can  be 
applied to medical ultrasonic imaging [15]-[21]. Bessel beams are further studied [22]-[30] along with 
the studies of acoustic transducers and ultrasound waves [127]-[130].

In medical imaging, nonlinear properties are important to provide additional information of diseased 
tissues.  Harmonics  of  Bessel  beams  due  to  the  tissue  nonlinearity  are  useful  to  obtain  higher  quality 
images by combining the localized properties of limited diffraction beams [22]-[23].  

B. Nonlinear Bessel Beams  

C. “Frozen Waves”  

It is clear from (14) that, single-frequency Bessel beams have two free parameters. One is the order 
of  the  Bessel  function  and  the  other  is  the  scaling  parameter  that  changes  the  phase  velocity  of  the 
Bessel beams. The order of the Bessel beams,  n , in (14) has been exploited to produce various limited 
diffraction  beams  of  different  transverse  beam  profiles  since  1995  [29]-[30].  Another  parameter,  the 
scaling parameter, α, in (14), has also been used for a linear superposition of Bessel beams to produce a 
beam of a desired axial profile [24]-[27] for zeroth-order Bessel beams. Although an annular array was 
used in the production of superposed Bessel beams in these studies, the number of annuli and the width 
of each ring are free to change. When the number of annuli approaches to infinity and the width of each 
ring  shrinks  to  zero  with  a  given  circular  aperture,  the  field  distribution  at  the  surface  of  the  annular 
array is in fact a continuous function. In a more general way, one could use X wave transform [28], [46]-
[47] to produce a wave whose shape would be close to a desired one under conditions such as the least-
square criterion [131] by changing both the order of the beams and the scaling parameter.  

In 2004, Zamboni-Rached has developed an analytical relationship between the scaling parameter of 
Bessel beams and the axial beam profile along the beam axis ( =0) for the zeroth-order Bessel beams. 
α, was called “Frozen 
The resulting linear superposition of Bessel beams of different scaling parameter, 
Waves” [132]. The method was extended to include superposition over both the scaling parameter and 
the order of the Bessel beams [133] to better control the transverse beam profile of the “frozen waves”. 
These  studies  not  only  provide  computationally  efficient  ways  for  beam  designs,  but  also  may  have 
applications in optical tweezers [134].

produces  the  wave.  Compare  (15)  with  (14),  it  is  easy  to  see  the  similarity  and  difference  between  a 
Bessel  beam  and  X  wave.  X  waves  are  multiple-frequency  waves  while  Bessel  beams  have  a  single 
frequency. However, both waves have the same limited diffraction property, i.e., they are propagation 
invariant. Because of multiple frequencies, X waves can be localized in both transverse space and time 
to  form  a  tight  wave  packet.  They  can  propagate  in  a  free  space  or  isotropic/homogeneous  media 
without  spreading  or  dispersion.  Choosing  specific

clear  that  (18)  is  a  solution  to  (20).  Limited  diffraction  solutions  to  the  Klein-Gordon  Equation  mean 
that a free relativistic particle may be accompanied by a rigidly propagating wave along the axis,  Nx , at 
a velocity that is greater than the speed of light in vacuum in a manner similar to that of X waves [41]-

I. Limited Diffraction Beams in Confined Spaces  

Limited diffraction beams in confined spaces are of interest [59]-[60], [142]. Previously, Shaarawi et 
al.  [143]  and  Ziolkowski  et  al.  [144]  have  shown  that  the  “localized  waves”  such  as  Focused  Wave 
Modes  and  Modified  Power  Spectrum  Pulses,  etc.,  can  also  propagate  in  waveguides  for  an  extended 
propagation depth. In the following, theoretical results of X waves propagating in a confined space such 
as a waveguide will be developed for acoustics, electromagnetics, and quantum mechanics [142].  

1.  Acoustic  Waves:  Assuming  that  Φ   in  (2)  represents  acoustic  pressure  in  an  infinitely  long 
cylindrical acoustical waveguide (radius 
), which is filled with an isotropic/homogeneous lossless fluid 
medium  enclosed  in  an  infinitely  rigid  boundary.  In  this  case,  the  normal  vibration  velocity  of  the 
medium  at  the  wall  of  the  cylindrical  waveguide  is  zero  for  all  the  frequency  components  of  the  X

There  are  other  implications  of  the  studies  above.  As  we  know,  light  in  free  space  behaves  like  a 
wave,  but  acts  as  particles  (photons)  when  interacts  with  materials.  Some  microscopic  structures  of 
materials could be considered as optical waveguides within which the light waves are confined. From 
the above discussion of the X waves in confined spaces, it is understood that only the light waves that 
have a higher energy (or frequency) can penetrate these materials or to cause interactions.  

J. X Wave Transformation  

 13

Because  X  waves  are  orthogonal  [61],  similar  to  plane  waves,  any  physically  realizable  waves  or 
well-behaved  solutions  to  the  wave  equation  can  be  expressed  as  a  linear  superposition  of  X  waves 
(inverse X wave transform) and the coefficients of the superposition can be determined (forward X wave 
transform) [46]-[47]. The inverse X wave transform is given by (Eq. (15) of [46]):

M. Computation of Limited Diffraction Beams  

Efficient  computation  of  limited  diffraction  beams  produced  by  a  finite  aperture  is  important  for 
understanding  the  properties  of  these  beams.  Angular  spectrum  decomposition  has  been  used  for  the 
study [155] and various methods have been investigated [156].  

 

A. Medical Ultrasound Imaging  

III. APPLICATIONS OF LIMITED DIFFRACTION BEAMS  

Limited diffraction beams are localized waves and are, in theory, propagation invariant. In practice, 
because the dimension of wave sources is always finite, these waves will eventually diffract. However, 
these waves have a large depth of field, meaning that they will propagate over a large distance without 
spreading. This property is useful in medical ultrasound imaging where an extended depth of focus is 
needed to provide clear images over the entire depth of interest within the thickness of the human body. 
Studies on this subject have been reported, for example, in the literatures [15]-[17], [157]-[162].  

B. Tissue Characterization (Identification)  

Due  to  the  large  depth  of  field  of  limited  diffraction  beams,  these  beams  may  be  used  for  tissue 
characterization  (identification)  [163]-[165].  For  example,  different  tissues  have  different  attenuations 
on ultrasound waves. If the waves diffract as they propagate, such as conventional focused waves, one 
has  to  compensate  for  the  diffraction  effects  of  the  waves  in  the  estimation  of  tissue  attenuation.  The 
compensation  process  could  be  computationally  intensive  and  tedious.  An  example  of  tissue 
characterization with limited diffraction beams is given in [165].  

C. High Frame Rate Imaging  

High frame rate 2D and 3D ultrasound imaging is important for visualizing fast moving objects such 
as the heart. Based on our previous studies of ultrasound diffraction tomography [166]-[170] and limited 
diffraction beams such as X waves [41]-[53], we have developed the high frame rate imaging method 
[62]-[83]. Recently, the method has been extended to include steered plane wave and limited diffraction 
array-beam transmissions [78]-[80].  

D. Two-Way Dynamic Focusing  

 15

A two-way dynamic focusing method was developed by transmitting limited diffraction array beams 
and receiving ultrasound echo signals with array beam weightings of the same parameters. This method 
increases image field of view and image resolution due to enlarged coverage of spatial Fourier domain 
[171].  

E. Medical Blood Flow Measurements  

Blood  flow  velocity  measurements  and  imaging  are  important  for  medical  diagnoses  [172]-[173]. 
However, with conventional Doppler method, only flow velocity that is along the ultrasound beam can 
be  measured.  To  measure  velocity  vector,  both  the  velocity  components  that  are  along  with  and 
transverse  to  the  beam  are  needed.  Limited  diffraction  beams  may  help  to  measure  the  transverse 
component of the velocity more accurately due to their spatial modulation properties [153], [174]-[175].  

F. Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) of Materials   

Nondestructive  evaluation  (NDE)  is  important  for  many  applications  such  as  finding  defects  in 
aircraft  engines  with  ultrasound  without  slicing  them  apart  or  destroying  them.  Similar  to  medical 
imaging, limited diffraction beams can also be applied to NDE on various industrial materials by getting 
images of a large depth of field [176]-[177].  

G. Optical Coherent Tomography  

Optical coherent tomography (OCT) uses the same principle of conventional ultrasound pulse-echo 
imaging.  It  is  able  to  obtain  microscopic  images  of  a  cross-section  along  an  optical  beam.  Similar  to 
ultrasound  imaging,  limited  diffraction  beams  can  be  applied  to  increase  the  depth  of  field  of  OCT 
[178].  

H. Optical Communications  

Limited  diffraction  beams  such  as  X  waves  [41]-[43]  are  orthogonal  in  space.  Because  of  this 
property, signals such as television (TV) programs in different channels can be sent over the same space 
from  the  same  channel  (carrier  frequency).  Limited  diffraction  beams  have  been  exploited  to  increase 
the capacity in communications using the property of their spatial orthogonality [179]-[180].  

I. Reduction of Sidelobes in Medical Imaging  

Limited diffraction beams can maintain a high resolution in medical imaging over a large depth of 
field.  However,  compared  to  focused  beams  at  their  focuses,  limited  diffraction  beams  have  a  higher 
sidelobe. Sidelobes may lower image contrast in ultrasound imaging, making the differentiation between 
benign  and  malignant  tissues  difficult.  Various  methods  have  been  developed  to  reduce  sidelobes  of 
limited diffraction beam in medical imaging [5], [181]-[184].  

IV. CONCLUSION  

Limited diffraction beams are a class of waves that may be localized in both space and time and can 
propagate rigidly in a free space or confined spaces to an infinite distance in theory at a superluminal 
speed. Because of the localized property and the fact that they are solutions to various wave equations, 
limited  diffraction  beams  may  provide  an  insight  into  various  physical  phenomena  and  may  have 
theoretical  significances.  In  addition,  limited  diffraction  beams  can  be  approximately  produced  with  a 
finite aperture and energy over a large depth of field, meaning that they can keep a small beam width 
over  a  large  distance.  This  and  other  properties  of  limited  diffraction  beams  make  them  suitable  for 
various  applications  such  as  medical  imaging,  tissue  characterization,  blood  flow  measurement, 
nondestructive evaluation of materials, and optical communications, etc.

Fig.  1.  Envelope  detected  Zeroth-order  X  Wave  in  a  50 
mm diameter rigid acoustic waveguide. The waves shown 
has an Axicon angle of 4o and 
 = 0.05 mm. (a) and (c) 
Band-limited  version  with  a  Blackman  window  function 
centered  at  3.5MHz  with  about  81%  of  fractional  -6dB 
bandwidth.  (b)  and  (d)  are  a  broadband  version.  The 
images in the top row are in a linear scale and those in the 
bottom row have a log scale to show the sidelobes.

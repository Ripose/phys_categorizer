Abstract  

Adiabatic  mixed  quantum/classical  (MQC)  molecular  dynamics  (MD)  simulations  were 

used to generate snapshots of the hydrated electron in liquid water at 300 K. Water cluster anions 

that include two complete solvation shells centered on the hydrated electron were extracted from 

the MQC MD simulations and embedded in a roughly 18 Å x 18 Å x 18 Å matrix of fractional 

point charges designed to represent the rest of the solvent. Density functional theory (DFT) with 

Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr  functional  and  single-excitation  configuration  interaction  (CIS)  methods 

were 

then  applied 

to 

these  embedded  clusters.  The  salient  feature  of 

these  hybrid 

DFT(CIS)/MQC MD calculations is significant transfer (ca. 18%) of the excess electron’s charge 

density  into  the  2p  orbitals  of  oxygen  atoms  in  OH  groups  forming  the  solvation  cavity.    We 

used  the  results  of  these  calculations  to  examine  the  structure  of  the  singly  occupied  and  the 

lower  unoccupied  molecular  orbitals,  the  density  of  states,  the  absorption  spectra  in  the  visible 

and ultraviolet, the hyperfine coupling (hfc) tensors, and the infrared (IR) and Raman spectra of 

these  embedded  water  cluster  anions.    The  calculated  hfc  tensors  were  used  to  compute  the 

1 

Electron  Paramagnetic  Resonance  (EPR)  and  Electron  Spin  Echo  Envelope  Modulation 

(ESEEM) spectra for the hydrated electron that compared favorably to the experimental spectra 

of trapped electrons in alkaline ice.  The calculated vibrational spectra of the hydrated electron 

are  consistent  with  the  red-shifted  bending  and  stretching  frequencies  observed  in  resonance 

Raman  experiments.    In  addition  to  reproducing  the  visible/near  IR  absorption  spectrum,  the 

hybrid  DFT  model  also  accounts  for  the  hydrated  electron’s  190-nm  absorption  band  in  the 

ultraviolet.  Thus, our study suggests that to explain several important experimentally observed 

properties  of  the  hydrated  electron,  many-electron  effects  must  be  accounted  for:  one-electron 

models that do not allow for mixing of the excess electron density with the frontier orbitals of the 

first-shell  solvent  molecules  cannot  explain  the  observed  magnetic,  vibrational,  and  electronic 

spectroscopy of this species. Despite the need for multielectron effects to explain these important 

properties,  the  ensemble-averaged  radial  wavefunctions  and  energetics  of  the  highest  occupied 

and three lowest unoccupied orbitals of the hydrated electrons in our hybrid model are close to 

the s- and p-like states obtained in one-electron models.  Thus, one-electron models can provide 

a remarkably good approximation to the multielectron picture of the hydrated electron for many 

applications; indeed, the two approaches appear to be complementary.

1.  Introduction. 

This  paper  is  the  second  part  of  a  two-part  series  on  the  structure  of  the  hydrated  electron, 

hyde

.  In  Part  1,  1  we  examined  several  idealized  water  clusters  that  trap  the  electron  in  their 

interior using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio methods.  We found that octahedral 

anions  with  OH  groups  pointing  towards  the  center  of  a  spherical  solvation  cavity  (known  as 
Kevan’s  model  of  hydrated  electron)  2,3  account  reasonably  well  for  the  observed  hyperfine 

coupling (hfc) tensors estimated for the electron trapped in low-temperature alkaline ices using 
Electron  Paramagnetic  Resonance  (EPR)  3,4,5  and  Electron  Spin  Echo  Envelope  Modulation 
(ESEEM)  spectroscopies.  2,3,6  Importantly,  this  result  depends  critically  on  the  use  of  a 
multielectron model 1,14,15,16 (as opposed to the standard one-electron approach), 7-13 because the 

multielectron  model  predicts  considerable  sharing  of  the  excess  electron  density  between  the 

cavity  and  the  frontier  2p  orbitals  of  the  oxygen  atoms  in  the  OH  groups  forming  the  cavity.  
Without this sharing, the magnetic resonance results cannot be explained even qualitatively. 1 

Although the results from Part 1 1 are suggestive, it is not clear whether the representation of 

the hydrated electron by such idealized gas-phase clusters is acceptable: the hydrated electron is 

a dynamic entity that constantly samples configurations of water molecules that vibrate, rotate, 

and otherwise move around.  This means that the ‘hydrated electron’ is not a rigid structure, but 
a statistical average over many configurations; 7-11 in this regard, hydrated electrons are different 

from non-solvent-supported chemical species, so a quantitative description of the 

hyde

 within the 

multielectron approach has to address this inherent variability.  In other words, it is impossible to 

find  a  single  representative  water  anion  structure  that  corresponds  to  the  statistical  average 

known as the ‘hydrated electron’ in liquid water.  Thus, the next logical step in the development 

of multielectron models of the 

 is finding a means of building this statistical picture.  This is 

hyde

the purpose of the present study. 

One  path  to  this  goal  is  Car-Parrinello  molecular  dynamics  (CPMD),  and  in  fact,  a  CPMD 

calculation of the 

hyde

 recently has been implemented by Boero et al. 17 In the present study, we 

suggest a different approach that is less computationally demanding but appears to successfully 

capture the essential physics of the problem.  Our approach capitalizes on the historical success 

of  one-electron  models  of  electron  solvation  in  rationalizing  the  dynamics  and  energetics  of

electron solvation.  7-13 We used adiabatic mixed quantum/classical (MQC) molecular dynamics 
(MD)  calculations  9  to  generate  a  dynamical  trajectory  of  the  hydrated  electron  in  its  ground 

electronic state, and then we extracted temporally well-separated snapshots from this trajectory.  

These  snapshots  became  the  input  for  multielectron  DFT    and  single-excitation  configuration 

interaction (CIS) calculations.  In these multielectron calculations, we explicitly considered only 

one  or  two  complete  solvation  shells  for  the  excess  electron;  the  remaining  atoms  in  the 

simulated solvent were replaced by point charges, a procedure we refer to as matrix embedding. 

(We  provide  a  detailed  justification  for  this  hybrid  embedded  cluster  approach  in  section  3, 

where  we  show  that  the  electron  density  is  tightly  localized  in  the  solvation  cavity  and  on  the 

dangling  OH  groups  forming  the  cavity).    It  turns  out  that  a  few  hundred  such  snapshots  are 

sufficient  to  build  a  robust  picture  of  the  excess  electron  in  water.    We  find  that  there  is 

significant  sharing  of  spin  and  charge  of  the  excess  electron  by  O  2p  orbitals  in  the  first-shell 
water molecules (a result which was hinted at in both Part 1 1 and other studies 14,15,16).  Based on 

this study, we picture the ground state of the ‘hydrated electron’ as an unusual kind of multimer 
radical anion  3 in which ~20% of the excess electron is shared between several first-shell water 

molecules and ~80% of the electron occupies a cavity between molecules.  

We also find that the sharing of electron density with the first-shell solvent molecules is not 

only  consistent  with  most  of  the  known  experimental  properties  of  the 

hyde

  but  is  in  fact 

necessary to account for some of these properties.  In the rest of this paper, we demonstrate how 

our  hybrid  approach  can  account  for  several  experimentally  observed  features  of  the 

hyde

, 

including:  (i) the energetics and the equilibrium optical spectrum of the 

hyde

 in the visible and 

ultraviolet  (UV);  18  (ii)  the  EPR  and  ESEEM  spectra  of  the 

;  1-6  and  (iii)  the  vibrational 

hyde

(resonance Raman) spectrum of the 

hyde

. 19,20   Our study is also able to explain why one-electron 

MQC models have been successful in explaining some of the aforementioned properties of the 

 even though to date, such one-electron models have not been able to account for the mixing 

into  the  nearby  water  frontier  molecular  orbitals:  although  the  true  multielectron  picture  of  the 

 is complex, on average, the radial density for the highest occupied (HOMO) and the three 

lowest unoccupied (LUMO) molecular orbitals resemble the s-like and p-like orbitals predicted 
by the one-electron models. 8b,9,11 In fact, for some observables (e.g., the optical spectrum in the 

hyde

visible),  the  fine  details  of  this  orbital  structure  do  not  matter,  and  even  crude  models  (e.g., 
dielectric  continuum  13  and  semicontinuum  models  12,13)  can  provide  adequate  general 

description  of  the  electron  wavefunction.    For  other  observables  (e.g.,  the  spin  density  maps 

provided by EPR and ESEEM spectroscopies and the resonance Raman spectrum), this level of 

approximation is inadequate because the fine details of the orbital structure do matter, and so an 

approach  that  can  account  for  mixing  of  the  excess  electron  into  the  water  frontier  molecular 

orbitals is needed.   

The rest of this paper is organized as follows:  The computational details of our MQC MD 

and DFT (CIS) calculations are given in section 2.   In section 3.1, we examine the structure of 

the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO), which is also HOMO. In section 3.2, we analyze 

the  density  of  states  (DOS)  of  the  electron,  examine  the  three  lower  unoccupied  molecular 

orbitals, and use the DFT and CIS methods to calculate the absorption spectrum of the 

hyde

.  In 

section 3.3, we use our DFT data to obtain hyperfine coupling tensors and simulate matrix EPR 

and  2H  ESEEM  spectra  of 

hyde

.  In  section  3.4,  we  discuss  the  vibrational  properties  of  the 

hydrated electron, and compare to recent resonance Raman experiments.  Finally, we summarize 

our results and offer some concluding remarks in section 4. 

In order to reduce the length of this paper, we have placed a significant amount of material 

(figures with the designator "S" (e.g., Figure 1S)) in the Supplementary Information.  

2. Computational Details.  

2.1. Mixed Quantum/Classical Molecular Dynamics (MQC MD) calculations.   

 

The electronic structure  calculations described in this paper were performed on  clusters 

of water molecules extracted from an 100-ps adiabatic MQC MD trajectory with a time step of 1 

fs.    In  this  trajectory,  the  water  molecules  moved  classically  according  to  the  velocity  Verlet 
algorithm  21  and  the  single  excess  quantum  mechanical  electron  was  confined  to  its  adiabatic 

ground  state.    The  200  water  molecules  occupied  a  cubic  18.17  Å  x  18.17  Å  x  18.17  Å 

simulation  cell  and  interacted  with  each  other  through  SPCf  (flexible  simple-point  charge) 
potentials. 22 The excess electron interacted with the water molecules through a pairwise-additive 
pseudopotential, Vp,  23 and at every time step the ground-state wave function, ψ, of the electron 
was calculated on a 16 x 16 x 16 cubic grid using an iterative-and-block-Lanczos algorithm.  24  

5

The force exerted by the electron on the water molecules was of the Hellmann-Feynman form, Fi 
=  –〈ψ|(cid:209)

iVp|ψ〉,  where  Fi  is  the  force  on  atom  i  and  (cid:209)

i  denotes  a  gradient  with  respect  to  the 

spatial coordinates of atom i.  The average temperature of the system was 296 K with root-mean-

square fluctuations of 8 K. 

We  extracted  from  this  trajectory  a  sequence  of  1000  snapshots  of  the 

hyde

  that  were 

separated by a time interval of  D

t = 100 fs.  In each of the extracted snapshots, the coordinates 

were shifted so that the center of mass of the electron, X, was at the origin and minimum image 

periodic  boundary  conditions  were  applied.    Water  molecules  were  treated  explicitly  if  the 

distance rXH  between X and one of the protons, H, was less than a chosen cutoff radius,  rcut ; the 

cluster size n is then defined as the number of such water molecules.  The remaining  “matrix” 
molecules were replaced 25,26 by point charges (chosen to be the same as in the SPCf model), 22 
= - 2QH   for  oxygen  (in  the  following,  such  water  anion  and 

= +0.41  for  hydrogen  and  QO

QH

neutral  clusters  are  referred  to  as  “embedded”  ones).  With  the  exception  of  the  IR-Raman 

simulations, , the cutoff radius rcut was chosen to be 4.75 Å, which corresponds to the first two 

solvation  shells  around  the  electron  cavity;  for  the  IR-Raman  calculations,  rcut  was  set  to  3  Å 

(although  for  the  neutral  clusters  discussed  in  section  3.4,  where  there  is  no  electron  center  of 

mass,  we  based  the  cutoff,  chosen  to  be  3.5  Å,  on  the  distance  from  one  of  the  O  atoms).  

Hereafter, we define the first solvation shell as including those water molecules for which at least 
< 3  Å.    We  then  label  the  protons  satisfying  this  condition  by  Hin 

one  of  the  protons  has  rXH

(‘inside’),  and  the  protons  in  the  first  solvation  shell  that  do  not  satisfy  this  condition  by  Hout 

(‘outside’).    We  also  label  oxygen  atoms  in  the  first  solvation  shell  ‘inside’  and  those  in  the 

second solvation shell ‘outside.’  We define the coordination number of the electron,  nH , as the 

number of Hin protons.  Histograms of the quantities nH  and  n  are shown in diagrams (i) and (ii) 

of  Figure  1a,  respectively.    Based  on  the  snapshots  chosen  from  our  one-electron  MQC  MD 

simulations, we find that the cavity electron is coordinated by 3-8 hydroxyl groups (with a mean 

coordination number 

Hn

 of ca. 6) inside a cluster of 12 to 25 water molecules (with an  n  of 

ca. 20 molecules).  

To better characterize the snapshots  chosen  for this study, in  Figure 1S(a) we show the 

distribution function 

 for the  rXH  distances, which has its first maximum at 2.26 Å.  This 

(

-
pair  distribution  function  is  similar  to  the  one  obtained  in  identical  MQC  MD  simulations  by 

Schwartz and Rossky using a much larger sample of  ehyd

 configurations.  9  In Figure 1S(b), we 

plot a histogram for the smallest of the X-O-Hin angles for water molecules in the first solvation 

shell.  The most probable value of this angle is 12-14° and the largest such angle is still less than 

60°:  the  OH  bonds  in  the  first  solvation  shell  clearly  point  preferentially  towards  X,  consistent 
with previous conclusions from the literature. 8,9  Figure 2 displays the X-H and X-O histograms 

for ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ atoms, as defined above, and Table 1 summarizes the mean values of 

the X-Hin and X-Hout distances, which are 2.4 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively.  We note that the mean 

X-Hin  distance  from  these  one-electron  snapshots  is  considerably  longer  than  the  2.1-2.2  Å 
distance suggested by magnetic resonance experiments on alkaline ices. 2,4,6 

2.2. DFT and CIS calculations.  

The electronic structure of the embedded water cluster anion snapshots described in the 

previous section was first modeled using unrestricted DFT with the B3LYP functional (Becke's 
exchange functional 27 and the correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr) 28 from Gaussian 98 
and 03, as noted. 29 The justification for using this implementation of DFT as opposed to ab initio 
methods for calculating magnetic resonance information was provided in Part 1 of this study.  1  
Unless  otherwise  specified,  for  all  of  our  DFT  calculations,  a  6-31G  split-valence  double-z

 

Gaussian  basis  set  augmented  with  diffuse  and  polarized  (d,p)  functions  (6-311++G**)  was 
used, 29 with a ghost ‘chlorine’ atom placed at the electron’s center of mass, X.These calculations 
(using the standard Prop=EPR routine in Gaussian 03) 29 yielded isotropic hfcc’s a H ,O  for the 1H 
nuclei (the hfcc’s on deuterons are 6.5 times smaller) and 17O nuclei, defined as 30

from our hybrid DFT-MQC MD model calculations are given in Table 1.  

The  IR  and  Raman  spectra  of  embedded  clusters  and  dispersed  water  molecules  were 

calculated  for  400  snapshots  using  the  DFT/6-31+G**  method  and  the  standard  Freq=Raman 
routine in Gaussian 98. 29 It is important to note that since the water molecules in the embedded 

clusters are not at their stationary points, the frequencies calculated from diagonalization of the 

Hessian  matrix  correspond  to  making  a  local  harmonic,  or  instantaneous  normal  mode, 

approximation.  Although  our  use  of  such  an  approximation  may  decrease  the  fidelity  of  our 

vibrational analysis, we know of no obvious way in which this shortcoming of our hybrid model 

can be overcome.  Once we completed the locally harmonic analysis, the resulting ‘line’ spectra 
(for normal modes only) were binned (with the bin width set to 50 cm-1) to produce the spectra 
shown  in  section  4.3.  These  line  spectra  were  used  to  calculate  centroids  n

where  I n( )   is  the  calculated  intensity  (this  binning  is  illustrated  in  Figure  15S  in  section  3.4). 

Note that the centroids calculated for the IR and Raman bands are different (Table 2).  Although 

our ensemble of snapshots is too small to obtain high-quality IR-Raman spectra, it was sufficient 

8 

to locate the band centroids with the accuracy of several cm-1, as may be  shown by  comparing 

the centroids calculated using eq. (3) with centroids from smaller subensembles.  

When comparing our calculated vibrational band centroids to experiment, it is important 
to  note  that  the  experimental  data  are  resonance  Raman  spectra,  19,20  whereas  our  simulated 

spectra  are  regular  IR  and  Raman  spectra.    Consequently,  for  our  large  embedded  water  anion 

clusters,  both  the  vibrations  of  the  OH  groups  forming  the  cavity  and  the  vibrations  in  water 

molecules  in  the  second  solvation  shell  are  present  in  the  spectrum,  whereas  the  experimental 

resonance  Raman  spectrum  selects  only  those  modes  that  are  significantly  displaced  upon 

electronic  excitation  of  the  electron,  which  are  presumably  those  of  only  the  first-shell  water 

molecules.  Since the calculation of a resonance Raman spectrum in our hybrid method was not 

feasible  with  the  available  computational  resources,  we  chose  to  examine  only  relatively  small 

clusters  with 

=

cutr

3  Å  in  order  to  selectively  observe  the  vibrations  of  water  molecules  in  the 

first solvation shell.  We also note that the process of embedding an explicitly treated cluster into 

a  matrix  of  point  charges  changes  the  calculated  vibration  frequencies  because  the  water 

molecules at the surface of the cluster interact with these point charges.  

 

For  simulation  of  electronic  spectra,  our  CIS  calculations  included  the  first  10  or  20 

excited  states,  which  were  used  to  calculate  both  transition  dipole  moments  and  transition 

energies for the absorption spectrum of 

 (in these CIS calculations, a reduced 6-31+G* or 6-

hyde

31+G** sets were used,  including an optional ghost 'Cl' atom at the electron’s center of mass). 

Oscillator strengths were calculated by averaging the line spectrum from each configuration over 

the ensemble of 200-1000 snapshots as well as binning the transitions in frequency space using a 

bin size of 0.1-0.2 eV.   

3. Results. 

3.1. The SOMO (HOMO).  

An important part of our DFT analysis was the examination of the orbital structure, and 

in  particular,  the  singly-occupied  molecular  orbital  (SOMO),  Y

,  which  is  also  the  HOMO.  In 

one-electron models, the wavefunction of the s-like ground state of the 

hyde

 is contained almost 

9 

-
-
entirely  within  the  solvation  cavity.  8-12    In  our  multielectron  hybrid  DFT  model,  however,  we 

observe that the SOMO is shared between the cavity and the O 2p orbitals of the first-shell water 

molecules.  Typical  isodensity  surface  maps  of  the  SOMO  for  two  sequential  snapshots  are 

shown  in  Figure  3,  and  a  larger  sample  of  such  maps  is  given  in  the  Supplement,  Part  B. 

Examination of Figure 3 (and the model clusters examined in ref. 1) indicates that in addition to 

the cavity, part of the SOMO occupies the frontal lobes of 2p orbitals of the oxygen atoms in the 

first  solvation  shell.    Moreover,  the  wavefunction  inside  the  cavity  and  in  these  frontal  lobes 

have  opposite  signs,  so  in  the  following  we  choose  a  phase  convention  so  that  the  intracavity 

SOMO  is  positive.    In  this  regard,  the  SOMOs  from  Gaussian  98  shown  in  Figure  3  are 

consistent with previous ab initio and DFT calculations for gas phase water anions that internally 
trap electron. 1,15,16 On the other hand, the recent CPMD simulations of the  ehyd

showed  no  such  features.  This  CPMD  calculation  also  located  the  first  peak  of  the 

distribution for the protons at 1.6 Å, 17 which is significantly shorter than 2.0-to-2.3 Å obtained 
in MQC MD,  9 path integral,  8 and mobile Gaussian orbital  11 molecular dynamics calculations.  

We believe that the unusual structure of the  ehyd

 in Boero et al.’s CPMD calculations may stem 

from the choice of pseudopotentials used in these calculations, the small box size (only 32 water 

 by Boero et al. 17 
)

(

molecules), and the method used for charge screening.   

Using the fact that most of the SOMO density on the water molecules is contained in the 

frontal lobes of O 2p orbital and has opposite phase to the SOMO density in the cavity, we found 

it useful to define “positive” and “negative” charge densities via

where  q ( )  is  the  Heaviside  step  function.    From  the  normalization  condition  of  Y

,  it  follows 

directly that  r + + r - = 1; our convention of choosing the positive phase inside the  cavity  gives 
r + > r -

additional  electron  density  in  positive  lobes  of  the  O  2p  functions).    Consistent  with  the 

conventional  way  in  which  the  spin  density  in  the  p-orbitals  is  determined  from  experimental 
EPR  data,  1,30  we  estimated  the  total  spin  density,  f

-104 G  is 

the corresponding atomic constant (see also Part 1).  30 The advantage of quantifying the orbital 

overlap this way (as compared to, e.g., orbital decomposition into atomic wavefunctions) is that 

the  tensor  given  by  eq.  (2)  “filters  out”  the  components  of  the  correct  symmetry  and  thus 

provides a local measure of the p-character.  This calculation indicates an 18±2% total overlap of 

the  SOMO  with  the  O  2p  orbitals  (see  Figure  1b  for  the  histogram  of  this  quantity).  Thus,  the 

penetration  of  the  hydrated  electron’s  wavefunction  into  the  water  molecules  of  the  first 

solvation shell is not negligible. 

To better characterize the SOMO, we found it convenient to introduce the angle-averaged 

(radial) density  r r( ) of the electron wavefunction, defined through equation

the cavity given that the most probable X-Hin distance is 2.26 Å.  Figure 4b also shows that 50-

60% of the spin density is contained within a 2.2-2.4 Å sphere and that 75% is contained within 

the 3 Å cutoff radius that we used to define the first shell of water molecules.  The figure also 

shows  the  diffuseness  of  the  excess  electron’s  wavefunction:  ca.  5%  of  the  spin  density  is 

contained beyond the most probable location of the Hout protons, most of which resides in the 2p 

orbitals of oxygen atoms in the second solvation shell.  

Despite  the  pronounced  features  between  2  and  3  Å  (at  which  the  lobes  of  the  O  2p 

orbitals  show  up),  the  general  outlook  of  the  SOMO  generated  from  the  many-electron 
calculation  is  similar  to  that  given  by  one-electron  models.  12,13    To  demonstrate  this,  we  note

electronic transition (see section 3.2); it also greatly exceeds the estimate of ca. 2.04 Å obtained 
directly from the MQC MD model using the Schnitker-Rossky electron-water pseudopotential. 30  

Using the experimental estimate for  gr  and the correlation plot given in Figure 2S, one obtains a 

mean X-Hin distance closer to 2.2 Å rather than the 2.4 Å given by our MQC MD model.  The 

EPR and ESEEM data also suggest smaller cavities than we calculate here (see ref. 1 and section 

3.3).  

3.2. Energetics and the absorption spectrum.  

In one-electron models, the ellipticity of the solvation cavity has important consequences 

for the absorption spectrum in the visible: the presence of asphericity splits the triply-degenerate 

p-like excited states, leading to three overlapping subbands with orthogonal transition moments. 
9  This  important  feature  (like  the  overall  particle-in-a-box  character  of  the  electron 

wavefunctions) is also found in both our hybrid DFT-MQC and CIS-MQC MD models. To see 

this, in this subsection, we begin by  exploring the density of states (DOS) function.  To obtain 

the DOS from the DFT calculations, we calculated histograms of the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues for 

the occupied and virtual eigenstates of both spin orientations (in our convention, the SOMO is an 

 function).  

Figure 3S(a) shows the DOS computed this way for our embedded water cluster anions 
=  4.75 Å).  The DOS exhibits two features near the bottom of the ‘conduction band’ 

(with  rcut

that are shown separately in Figure 6a.  Feature (i) results from the highest occupied  a - orbital 

(the  Kohn-Sham  HOMO,  which  is  also  the  SOMO)  that  is  located  ca.  -1.69  eV  below  the 

vacuum energy (the DOS maximum is at -1.8 eV vs. -1.75 eV given by the CPMD calculation of 
Boero  et  al).  17    Feature  (ii)  derives  from  the  three  lowest  unoccupied  molecular  a

orbitals 

(LUMO,  LUMO+1,  and  LUMO+2),  which  have  centroids  at  0.42,  0.65,  and  0.86  eV, 

respectively.    It  is  natural  to  make  a  correspondence  between  these  three  states  and  the  three 
nondegenerate p-states observed in one-electron models. 8-11  Given the correspondence between 

the  multielectron  DOS  and  the  energetics  observed  in  one-electron  models,  we  expect  that 

transitions from the SOMO to these three states will dominate the optical spectrum in the visible.  

To  examine  this,  in  Figure  6b,  we  plot  histograms  of  the  corresponding  transition  energies, 

which  indeed  show  three  distinctive  p-subbands  with  centroids  at  2.11,  2.34,  and  2.55  eV;  we 

note that these histograms are not identical with the spectra because we have not weighted these 

by  their  corresponding  oscillator  strengths.  For  comparison,  path  integral  calculations  by 
Schnitker  et  al.  8b  using  the  same  pseudopotential  as  for  our  MQC  MD  calculations  gave  peak 

positions at 2.1, 2.5, and 2.9 eV.  The path integral calculations yield an absorption spectrum that 

is shifted to the blue by 0.34 eV relative to the experimental one (shown by the dashed curve in 

Figure  7b),  which  is  centered  at 

mE

1.7  eV.  32    Note  that  energy  of  the  HOMO  generally 

increases (Figure 2S(b)) and the corresponding energy gaps between the HOMO and the lower 

unoccupied states decrease (Figure 2S(c)) with the increasing radius of gyration 

gr : that is, the 

spread  in  these  energies  is  largely  accounted  for  by  the  variation  in  the  cavity  size.  The  same 

anticorrelation  was  observed  in  the  MQC  calculations  of  Coudert  and  Boutin,  33    for 

hyde

  in 

nanoconfined water pools in zeolites, and Rossky and Schnitker,  23 for the hydrated electron in 
bulk water. 

Figures  7a  and  7b  show  the  absorption  spectrum  calculated  using  CIS(N=10)/6-31+G* 

method (section 2) for our embedded water anion clusters with 

4.75 Å.  We note that the 

=

cutr

excited  states  of 

hyde

  are  substantially  more  diffuse  than  the  ground  state  (see  the  discussion 

below). Thus, to ensure that these CIS calculations are reliable for these excited states, more than 

two  water  shells  need  to  be  treated  explicitly  with  our  embedding  method.  Unfortunately, 

including additional water shells is not feasible because of the excessive computational demands 

of such a large calculation.  Even though we are not certain that the excited-state wavefunctions 

14 

-
»

-
are  converged  when  only  two  solvent  shells  are  treated  explicitly,  we  can  nevertheless  draw 

some conclusions from these calculations, as the spectra of 

 calculated via CIS using a ghost 

hyde

atom essentially does not change when either one and two surrounding water shells are explicitly 

included  (Figure  4S(a)).  Thus,  for  the  largest  CIS  calculation  we  can  perform,  the  calculated 

absorption spectrum appears not to be sensitive to the size of the embedded cluster. 

Despite this lack of size sensitivity, the CIS-calculated spectrum is still significantly blue-

shifted  relative  to  experiment  (Figure  7b).    This  blue  shift  is  likely  the  result  of  the  level  of 

theory  that  we  use  (CIS(N=10)/6-31+G*).  Specifically,  this  CIS  calculation  does  not  correctly 

reproduce the electrostatics of bulk water. The typical Mulliken charge on the protons from our 

CIS calculations is QH=0.55, which is substantially greater than SPCf model charge of QH=0.41 

that is known to reproduce the  experimental dipole in the liquid and agrees well with the DFT 

calculations. To understand the effects of CIS generating too large a dipole for liquid water, we 

performed  single-electron  MQC  calculations  using  an  artificially  large  dipole  moment  for  the 

surrounding water molecules and we found that increasing the water dipole increases the s-p gap 

of the hydrated electron. In addition, we note that single-excitations in the CIS technique are not 

sufficient  to  allow  the  water  molecules  to  polarize  appropriately  in  the  presence  of  the  excited 

states of 

hyde

, so the very fact that CIS includes only single excitations also tends to increase the 

s-p  gap.    Overall,  the  best  we  can  infer  from  the  CIS  spectra  shown  in  Figure  7  is  that  it  can 

reproduce  the  visible  absorption  spectrum  of  the  hydrated  electron  about  as  well  as  traditional 
one-electron  MQC  calculations  8,23  that  also  exhibit  significant  blue  shift  (see  above).  A 

spectrum that more closely resembles the experimental one (including the characteristic “tail” in 

the  blue)  was  obtained  in  a  CIS(N=20)/6-31+G**  calculation  that  included  only  one  complete 

solvation shell of water molecules and no ghost atom (Figure 5S(a)). Furthermore, almost perfect 

agreement  with  the  experiment  was  obtained  when  in  the  latter  calculation  the  matrix  of  point 

charges  was  removed  (Figure  5S(b)).  This  illustrates  great  sensitivity  of  the  calculated  CIS 

spectra  to  the  details  of  cluster  embedding  and  the  choice  of  the  basis  set.  This  sensitivity,  in 

turn, is explained by large spatial extent of the excited states and difficulty of obtaining the outer 

parts of the electron wavefunctions correctly. 

With the above caveats in mind, the calculated CIS spectra, despite considerable sharing 

of the excess electron into the O 2p orbitals, still exhibit the features that are observed in (one-

15 

-

electron)  path  integral  and  MQC  MD  calculations.  The  three  subbands  centered  at  2.09,  2.43, 

and 2.76 eV (Figure 7a) correspond to the three lowest excited states that have nearly orthogonal 

transition  dipole  moments  (see  the  inset  in  Figure  7b).  Each  one  of  these  subbands  carries  an 

integral  oscillator  strength  of  ca.  0.3.  The  total  integrated  oscillator  strength  is  ca.  0.95;  for 

CIS(N=20)/6-31+G**  calculation  shown  in  Figure  5S(b),  it  is  ca.  1.15.  There  is  an 

anticorrelation  between  the  transition  dipole  moment  and  the  transition  energy  (Figure  4S(b)) 
that is also seen in mobile Gaussian set calculations of Borgis and Staib.  11 The estimates of  gr  

for  the  radius  of  gyration  obtained  using  eq.  (10)  are  2.14  Å  (Figure  7b)  and  2.25  Å  (Figure 

5S(a)) (both of which are considerably lower than the direct estimate for this parameter obtained 

using eq. (8) (see section 3.1).  

We  can  also  compare  the  excited  states  from  the  CIS  calculations  with  the  Kohn-Sham 

orbitals obtained in the DFT calculations.  In Figure 6S, we show isodensity contour plots from 

our DFT calculations of  the Kohn-Sham HOMO, HOMO-1,  LUMO,  LUMO+1, and  LUMO+2 

for  one  of  the  snapshots;  we  find  that  all  such  isodensity  surfaces  are  qualitatively  similar.    A 

sequence  of  such  plots  for  the  LUMO  (from  a  different  snapshot  than  that  in  Figure  6S)  as  a 

function of density level is shown in Figure 7S.  The familiar dumbbell shape of the ‘p-orbital’ is 

not  readily  recognizable,  although  the  three  lower  unoccupied  states  do  exhibit  p-like 

polarization,  each  orthogonal  to  the  others  (Figure  6S).    Nevertheless  the  orbital  structure  of 
these  ‘p-states’  is  rather  different  from  that  obtained  in  MQC  MD  models  9  (and  the  CPMD 
model): 17 only a fraction of the total ‘p-state’ density (ca. 20%, Figure 8S(a)) is contained inside 

the cavity.  The p-character of these electronic states is achieved mainly through the polarization 

of  the  frontal  O  2p  orbitals  in  the  OH  groups  forming  the  cavity:  the  phase  of  the  electron  in 

these orbitals on one side of the cavity assumes a positive sign, while the phase of the electron in 

the  O  2p  orbitals  straight  across  the  cavity  in  the  direction  of  the  transitional  dipole  moment 

assumes  a  negative  sign.    In  addition,  we  also  see  both  positive  and  negative  excess  electron 

density  in  the  interstitial  cavities  between  the  water  molecules  of  the  first  and  the  second 

solvation shells.  Thus, in our multi-electron calculations, we see that the excited ‘p-like states’ 

of the 

hyde

 extend further out of the cavity than the ‘s-like’ ground state.  To illustrate this, angle-

averaged  densities  for  the  LUMO,  LUMO+1,  and  LUMO+2  are  plotted  in  Figure  8S(a).    The 

corresponding  gyration ellipsoid for these orbitals is 1.8 Å x 2.2 Å x 3.3 Å (the distribution of 

16 

-
semiaxes is shown in Figure 8S(b)), making them nearly twice the size of the gyration ellipsoid 

for the SOMO (section 3.1).  The mean meridianal eccentricity of these three excited states is ca. 

0.79, which is close to the theoretical 0.75 for a p-orbital, and the mean radius of gyration is rg ≈ 

4.33 Å (vs. 2.75 Å for the HOMO).  Once again, despite the complex orbital structure and the 

crucial  involvement  of  O  2p  orbitals,  we  observe  that  on  average,  the  lowest  unoccupied 

molecular orbitals in the DFT calculations still resemble the p-type states given by one-electron 

models. 

By contrast, a novel feature of our DFT calculations that is not captured by one-electron 

models can be seen in Figure 3S(a), which shows an onset (feature (iii)) in the density of states 

that  results  from  the  occupied  O  2p  orbitals  in  the  water  molecules.    This  onset  arises  from  a 

band of HOMO-1 orbitals that are composed of  1b1 orbitals of the water molecules in the first 

solvation  shell;  a  typical  such  HOMO-1  orbital  is  shown  in  Figure  5S(b).    Our  calculations 

suggest that the onset of this band starts 5.75 eV below the vacuum level and it has its first peak 

at –7.5 eV.  The presence of this peak suggests that there should be an electronic transition from 

the occupied O 2p orbitals into the HOMO at ca. 5.95 eV (~210 nm).  In fact, the experimentally 

observed UV band of the hydrated electron peaks at 6.5 eV (190 nm) with an onset around 220 
nm. 18 Thus, our hybrid DFT-MQC MD model provides an assignment for the observed UV band 

of the hydrated electron. [We note that our assignment of the band as involving transitions from 

the O 2p orbitals of water molecules in the first solvation shell was also given speculatively by 
Hart and co-workers in 1976].  18  The CIS method cannot reproduce this 190 nm band because 

the  limited  size  and  number  of  excited  states  in  our  calculation  excludes  the  possibility  of 

excitations of the core electrons on the adjacent water molecules.   

To better understand the origin of these transitions, in Figure 3S(b) we plot both the DOS 
= 3.5 Å from a central oxygen atom) and 

function for 200 embedded neutral clusters (using  rcut

the  DOS  for  the  anionic  clusters  including  only  a  point  negative  charge  at  X  (instead  of  a  full 

description  of  the  excess  electron);  we  also  include  the  DOS  of  embedded  small  water  anions 
= 3 Å).   Figure 3S shows that the DOS of both the neutral

and small anion clusters have three peaks at –13 eV, -9.8 eV, and –7.6 eV that correspond to the 

1b2,  3a1,  and  1b1  orbitals  of  neutral  water  molecules  (see  Figure  20  in  ref.  40  for  a  sketch  of 

these orbitals); the respective bands for these orbitals have been observed experimentally in the 

17 

photoelectron spectra of liquid water by Faubel and co-workers. 34  Figure 3S also shows that the 

presence of a point negative charge in the cavity causes a Stark shift of the eigenvalues towards 

the  midgap  by  ca.  1.1  eV.    The  most  prominent  feature  in  the  DOS  of  the  anionic  clusters 

corresponds to the upshifted 1b1 band (that is, the HOMO-1 orbital) that arises from the O 2np 

orbital in the water molecule that is perpendicular to its plane (Figure 6S(b)).   It turns out that 

even  a  point  charge  placed  at  the  cavity  center  can  fully  account  for  this  upshift;  a  full 

wavefunction description of the intracavity electron does not significantly change the calculated 

DOS for occupied states with energies more negative than -3 eV. 

 

To summarize this section, our hybrid DFT- and CIS-MQC MD calculations account for 

many of the experimentally observed features of the hydrated electron, including its absorption 

bands  in  the  visible  and  UV.  The  three  lower  unoccupied  states  are  nondegenerate  and 

correspond  to  p-type  orbitals  oriented  along  the  three  principal  axes  of  the  electron’s  elliptical 

cavity (section 3.1).  The splitting between the corresponding  p-subbands and their widths are 
comparable  to  the  those  reported  in  both  MQC  MD  9  and  CPMD  calculations  17  despite  the 

qualitative differences between these three models.  Although the DFT calculations yield rather 

different orbital structure for the ‘p-states’ (Figures 6S and 7S) than the MQC MD and other one-
electron models,  8-11 the absorption spectrum still resembles the one simulated using such one-

electron  models.    Thus,  our  results  suggest  that  the  optical  spectrum  alone  cannot  be  used  to 

validate  or  invalidate  models  for  the 

.    Instead,  other  experimental  features,  such  as  hfcc 

hyde

parameters determined using magnetic resonance methods, 1-6 or vibrational parameters obtained 
from  resonance  Raman  19,20  are  needed  to  refine  our  theoretical  understanding  of  the  hydrated 

electron. 

 3.3. EPR and ESEEM spectra 

 

EPR and ESEEM spectroscopy provide estimates for hfcc’s that strongly depend on the 

cavity  geometry  and  amount  of  spin  density  of  the  excess  electron  overlapping  with  magnetic 
nuclei (1H, 2H, and 17O) in the nearby water molecules.  In Part 1 of this study, 1 we found that in 

water  cluster  anions  that  trap  the  electron  internally,  the  excess  spin  and  charge  density  are 

localized mainly on the OH groups of the first solvation shell. For the embedded cluster anions 

examined  in  the  present  study,  this  same  type  of  distribution  is  also  seen,  as  documented  in

Examination of this latter plot suggests that for the anionic water clusters, both the O atoms in 

the second solvation shell and the Hout atoms in first solvation shell have an atomic charge that is 

within  0.02  e  of  what  is  observed  for  bulk  water  molecules.    For  the  solvating  OH  groups, 

however,  the  charge  on  the  Hin  hydrogens  is  0.2  more  negative  than  in  neutral  water,  and  the 

charge on the first-shell oxygen atoms is 0.17 more positive than in neutral water.  Figure 9S(a) 

also  shows  that  the  spin  density  follows  a  similar  trend:    the  spin  density  on  the  Hout  nuclei  is 

small and on the oxygen nuclei in the second shell is almost negligible; the most probable values 

for  the  spin  density  on  the  Hin  and  the  first-shell  O  atoms  are  +0.1±0.05  and  -0.04±0.01, 

respectively.  It is noteworthy that the distribution of the spin density for the Hin atoms is very 

broad, spanning a range from -0.2 to +0.4.  

Figures  8a  and  8b  show  histograms  of  the  isotropic  and  anisotropic  components  of  the 
hyperfine  coupling tensor for Hin and Hout protons and  17O nuclei, respectively (see section 2.2 

for  the  definition  of  classes  of  the  nuclei).  This  figure  illustrates  the  difficulty  of  finding  a 

‘representative’  water  cluster  that  describes  the  hydrated  electron  (such  as,  for  example, 
“Kevan’s” octahedral model examined in Part 1): 1 there is a broad distribution of calculated hfcc 

values,  and  the  distributions  for  the  isotropic  hfcc’s  are  skewed,  so  the  mean  values  are  quite 

different from the most probable ones (Table 1).  The mean values of  Oa  for oxygen-17 nuclei in 

the  first  and  the  second  solvation  shells  are  ca.  -15  G  and  ca.  -2.1  G,  respectively.    The

glasses, the proton contribution, 

HM 2 , was determined experimentally to be between 21 and 23 
G2.  4,6  Our  hybrid  calculation  gives  a  mean  value  of  17.3  G2  (a  histogram  of  our  calculated 

values  for 

HM 2   is  shown  in  Figure  11S(b));  ca.  80%  of  the  mean  value  comes  from  the

from the remote matrix protons, which can be treated using the point-dipole approximation.  Our 

slightly low estimate for

G; the experimental estimates of this quantity are 6-7 G. 2,6 It is worth noting that due to the very 

steep (cubic) dependence of the dipole component of the hfcc tensor on  XHr

in the cavity size causes a large error in the estimates for 

H

zzB . (The fact that our cavity size is 

likely  too  large  is  also  evident  when  comparing  our  calculated  radius  of  gyration 

gr   for  the 

electron to experimental estimates, as noted in section 3.1).   

Figure  12S(a)  shows  the  simulated  EPR  spectrum,  which  is  close  to  Gaussian  in  shape 
and which looks much like the experimental spectrum in the alkaline glasses. 4 The peak-to-peak 
line width for  D Bpp  of 9.1 G that we calculate compares well with the experimental estimate of

For  17O  nuclei,  the  second  moment  of  the  EPR  spectrum  is  ca.  6x103  G2,  almost  all  of

reported  experimental  estimate  of  134  G2.  As  we  observed  in  Part  1,  1  all  ab  initio  and  DFT 

models of the hydrated electron tend to give such large estimates for 

OM 2 .  We note, however, 
that  the  experimental  estimate  of  Schlick  et  al.  5a  was  compromised  by  their  subsequent 
observation  5b of a strong spectral overlap between one of the resonance lines of the O- radical

and the narrow EPR signal from the “electron,” which had  D Bpp

the O- anion is formed with the same yield in the same radiolytic reaction that yields the

16O  glasses,  the  two  narrow  EPR  signals  from  ehyd
because the signals overlap in 17O enriched samples, the EPR spectrum in such enriched samples 

  and  O-  are  spectrally  well  separated,  but 

is very complex: there are 7 lines from 17O- spanning 400 G with the 

IIg  component (Figure 1 in 

ref. 5b) strongly overlapping with the EPR signal from the electron. Thus, the small 

2M estimate 
of  134  G2  given  by  Schlick  et  al.,  that  was  obtained  using  17O  enriched  samples,  is  subject  to 

some doubt.  

To  better  understand  the  EPR  spectrum  of  the  enriched  samples,  in  Figure  12S(b),  we 
used  our  calculated  hfc  tensors  for  1H  and  17O  nuclei  to  simulate  the  EPR  spectrum  of  an 

oxygen-17  enriched  sample.    We  find  that  the  EPR  line  decomposes  into  two  distinct  spectral 
» 135  G2  (in  good  agreement  with  the 
» 23  G  and  M2
contributions,  a  narrow  one  with  D Bpp
estimates of Schlick et al.  5a) and a very broad line with  D Bpp
sample  with  37%  17O  enrichment,  there  is  a  ca.  10%  probability  that  the  first  solvation  shell 

» 1980 G2.  For a 

» 89 G and  M2

would  have  no  magnetic  oxygen-17  nuclei.  We  assign  the  narrow  line  as  arising  from  such 

isotopic configurations, so that the electron is only weakly coupled to the oxygen-17 nuclei in the 

second solvation shell.  The isotope configurations that include at least one oxygen-17 nucleus in 

the first solvation shell, on the other hand, are responsible for the broad line.  It is worth noting 

that our simulation in Figure 12S(b) neglects  any  differences in the paramagnetic relaxation of 

these  two  kinds  of  hydrated  electrons.  Small-amplitude  movement  of  water  molecules  in  the 

frozen  samples  would  cause  efficient  spin  relaxation,  due  both  to  the  large  hfcc’s  on  the  first-

shell  oxygens  and  the  steep  dependence  of  the  isotropic  hfcc  on  the  X-O  distance  (Figure 
10S(a)). The narrow line from the electron in the 37% 17O enriched sample is superimposed on a 
much  broader  signal  that  was  attributed  to  one  of  the  components  of  the  17O-  radical  multiplet 

(that shows a complex pattern of broad lines). This narrow resonance line was recognized as the

EPR  signal  originating  from 

  from  the  microwave  power  saturation  behavior  of  the  spin

transition, i.e., this line was selected by its long relaxation time. Broad resonance lines that were 
not  saturated  were  attributed  to  the  17O-  radical.    Such  a  criterion  for  the  recognition  of  the 

(tentative)  EPR  signal  from  the 

  discriminates  against  broad  EPR  signals  with  short 

hyde

relaxation  times  that  are  expected  for  trapped  electrons  that  are  strongly  coupled  to  17O  in  the 
first  solvation  shell.    We  believe,  therefore,  that  the  EPR  results  of  Schlick  et  al.  5  do  not 

contradict our hybrid DFT model, as the experimental results may be accounted for by assuming 
that  only  weakly  coupled  electrons  (for  which  the  magnetic  17O  nuclei  are  in  the  second 
solvation  shell  only)  are  selected  using  the  ad  hoc  criterion  suggested  by  Schlick  et  al.:  5b 
electrons that are strongly coupled to the 17O nuclei in the first solvation shell relax rapidly and 
have broad EPR lines that are superimposed on the comparably broad lines from the 17O- radical. 

We  turn  next  to  the  experimental  ESEEM  results  for  NaOD:D2O  glasses,  which  are 

shown  in  Figure  9  (see  Appendix  A  of  Part  1  for  a  brief  introduction  to  ESEEM  spectroscopy 

and  how  such  spectra  are  simulated).  Figure  9(a)  shows  simulated  Fourier  Transform  modulo 

primary  (p-)  ESEEM  spectra;  in  these  calculations,  we  did  not  consider  the  (magnetically) 

weakly  coupled  matrix  deuterons.    These  calculations  reflect  the  “ideal”  spectra  that  would  be 

obtained  assuming  that  the  EPR  spectrometer  has  no  dead  time  and  that  there  is  no  relaxation 

that  narrows  the  observation  window.    In  Figure  9(c),  however,  we  include  such  effects, 
assuming a dead time of 250 ns and a relaxation time of 2 m s, as in the experiments of Astashkin 
et  al.)  6    For  comparison,  the  experimental  spectra  are  shown  in  Figure  9(b).  Since  the  weakly 
coupled matrix nuclei yield very strong signals at n

D≈ 2.2 MHz is the NMR 
frequency  of  the  deuteron  in  the  magnetic  field  of  EPR  spectrometer),  Astashkin  et  al.  6  used

authors also used additional rejection filtering  at  a frequency of 7.6 MHz to reduce the (weak) 
modulation signal from magnetic 23Na nuclei; we note, however, that all the various filtering also 

serves  to  distort  the  spectrum.    The  two  peaks  marked  (i)  and  (ii)  in  panel  (b)  of  Figure  9

for  the  proton  hfcc’s)  the  corresponding  lines  are  broad.    The  reported  estimates  of  “mean” 

hfcc’s  correspond  to  the  positions  of  peaks  that  are  not  well  defined  for  such  broad  lines.  
Simulation  of  the  FT  pESEEM  spectrum  using  such  “mean”  values  for  one,  two,  6  or  six  2 

magnetically  equivalent  deuterons  do  not  yield  traces  that  resemble  the  experimental  ones 

(Figure A1 in ref. 1 and ref. 6).   

By contrast, our simulation based on our hybrid many-electron calculation involves all of 

the deuterons coupled to the electron and averages over all such configurations.  To distinguish 

the  contributions  from  different  groups  of  nuclei,  Figures  9(a,c)  show  three  traces  plotted 

together: a trace for all deuterons in the first and the second solvation shells, a trace for only the 

Din nuclei, and a trace for just the close-in Din nuclei with  rXD

< 2 Å (for which

5.6 G in the protonated sample). Since the deuterons in the second solvation shell are 

only  weakly  coupled,  these  nuclei  give  narrow  lines  in  the  FT  pESEEM  spectra  that  are 

superimposed on the broad signals from the Din nuclei.  At high frequencies, there are also two 

lines  (marked  (iii)  and  (iv)  that  correspond  to  the  third  harmonic  of  the  NMR  frequency  and  a 

combination  frequency,  respectively,  which  are  clearly  seen  in  panel  (b).    These  characteristic 

features were missing from all previous reconstructions of the ESEEM spectra.  We note that no 

rejection filtering was used for our simulated ESEEM spectra, so the sharp lines from the distant 

deuterons at  D

 and 

n

 are superimposed on the broader lines of Din deuterons.  As seen from 

the  comparison  of  panels  (b)  and  (c),  the  simulated  FT  pESEEM  spectrum  matches  the 

experimental  spectrum  in  the  overall  shape,  although  the  center  bands  are  shifted  to  lower 

frequency.    This  is,  once  again,  a  consequence  of  overestimated  cavity  size  in  the  MQC  MD 

model.  Longer X-Da distances result in smaller dipolar coupling (Figure 6S(b)) and thus a lower 
< 2 Å, however, it is possible to 

 frequency.  By choosing only those nuclei for which rXD

match the simulated and the experimental ESEEM spectra both in the positions of bands (i) and 
(ii)  and  their  widths,  as  seen  in  Figure  9(c)).    The  results  obtained  in  Part  1  of  this  study  1  for 

model octahedral clusters suggest that the matching is possible only for X-Din distances of 1.9-

2.2  Å.    Although  the  difference  between  this  optimum  distance  of 

XHr

  and  the  MQC  MD 

average of 2.4 Å is small, it is sufficient to reduce 

, which steeply depends on this distance.

3.4. Vibrational Spectra 

In  resonance  Raman  spectroscopy,  only  those  vibrational  modes  that  are  significantly 
displaced upon  electronic excitation show resonance enhancement;  19,20 thus, resonance Raman 

spectroscopy provides an excellent probe of the water molecules in the immediate vicinity of the 

hydrated  electron.    The  vibrational  peaks  in  the  experimental  resonance  Raman  spectra  of  the 

hyde

  all  exhibit  significant  downshifts  relative  to  the  peaks  present  in  neat  water  without  an 

excess electron.  According to Tauber and Mathies, 19 the resonance Raman peak position for the 
 in H2O (vs. those for bulk water), in cm-1, are:  librations at 410 (vs. 425-450), 530 (vs. 530-

ehyd

590),  698  (vs.  715-766);  the  H-O-H  bend  at  1610  (vs.  1640);  and  the  H-O  stretches  at  3100 

(3420).  Thus, the downshift of the bend mode, which exhibits a narrow, symmetric line, is ca. 
30 cm-1, and the downshift of the stretch mode (as estimated by the shift of the half-maximum of 
the broad, asymmetric line) is ca. 200 cm-1.  The question we address in this section is how to 

account for these experimentally observed vibrational downshifts. 

There have been previous ab initio and DFT calculations for gas phase

  35 clusters in which the  experimentally observed downshifts for 

the bending and stretching modes were qualitatively reproduced, suggesting that electron sharing 

with the nearby water molecules is the key to understanding the downshifts. One convenient way 

to demonstrate how sharing of the electron density by O 2p orbitals of water molecules affects 

the  vibrations  in  these  molecules  is  to  examine  the  octahedral  model  of  the  hydrated  electron 

(that is, a gas phase hexamer water anion that traps the electron internally; see Figure 1(a) in ref. 
16O  molecules  in  the  geometry-optimized 
1).  Thus,  we  elected  to  examine  the  vibrations  of  1H2

hexamer anion clusters using DFT at the B3LYP/6-31+G** level; we note that with this level of 
DFT,  the  normal  vibrational  frequencies  calculated  for  isolated  water  molecules  are  1603  cm-1 
(n

1 ,  symmetric  H-O  stretch),  and  3932  cm-1  (n

2 ,  H-O-H  bend),  3800  cm-1  (n

3 ,  asymmetric 

stretch),  which  agree  only  qualitatively  with  the  experimental  frequencies  of  1595,  3657,  and 
3756 cm-1, respectively.   

24

In Figure 10, we plot the cavity size ( XHr

) dependence of the vibrational band centroids 

of the water H-O-H bending and O-H stretching modes both for geometry-optimized octahedral 

anions. and for neutral octahedral clusters with the same  XHr

. For the O-H stretch, we find that 

the downshift is linear with  f

O , defined in section 3.1 (Figure 13S), emphasizing that electron 

2 p

sharing  with  the  first-shell  water  molecules  is  what  is  primarily  responsible  for  the  change  in 
» 2-2.1 Å, the DFT calculations for the 
vibrational frequency. Figure 10 also shows that for  rXH
anion  hexamers  give  ~20  and  200-250  cm-1  downshifts  for  the  band  centroids  of  H-O-H  bend 

and  the  O-H  stretch,  respectively;  both  of  these  estimates  are  in  good  agreement  with 
experiment. 19 

Although they produce good agreement with experiment, the calculations summarized in 

Figure 10 are not entirely convincing because the hallmark of liquid water is its network of H-

bonds, and this network  is absent in our calculations for isolated  gas-phase clusters.  Thus, we 

examine  the  vibrational  spectra  of  the 

  calculated  using  our  hybrid  embedded  cluster 

hyde

approach, even though such an approach (which is based on a local harmonic approximation, see 

section 2) is somewhat less rigorous than a full ab initio calculation. The vibrational spectra of 

the 

hyde

 calculated using our hybrid embedded cluster approach are shown in Figures 11 and 12, 

and the vibrational band centroids are summarized in Table 2.  Figure 11a shows the calculated 

IR spectrum for an ensemble of 400 embedded water molecules generated in an MD simulation 
of neat SPCf  22 water (on which our MQC MD calculations are based).  The embedded neutral 
water  clusters  show  a  narrow  H-O-H  bending  band  centered  at  1747  cm-1  and  a  broad  O-H 
stretch band centered at 3127 cm-1.  We find that the exact positions of these two band centers 

depends  sensitively  on  the  assumed  charge 

HQ   on  the  matrix  protons  (Figure  13S(b)):  the 

greater the charge, the lower the calculated frequency.  For 

HQ =0.41 e (the choice used in SPCf 
model), 22 the mean Mulliken atomic charge on the explicitly-treated protons is +0.36 e, leading 

to  the  vibrational  frequencies  summarized  in  Table  2.    Traces  (ii)  and  (iii)  in  Figure  11, 

respectively,  show  that  even  the  vibrational  bands  of  medium-size  neutral  clusters  (whose  size 

distribution  is  shown  in  Figure13S(a))  are  somewhat  different  from  those  of  embedded  water 

molecules; it is clear that the vibrational frequencies we calculate for our embedded neat water 

model compare poorly with experiment.   

25 

-
-
Despite the fact that the absolute positions of the vibrational features calculated using our 

embedded water clusters do not match experiment, Figure 11 shows that the downshifts of these 

bands in the presence of the excess electron are well described by our hybrid calculation: we see 
downshifts  of  the  librational  modes  at  750  cm-1,  the  H-O-H  bending  mode  at  1700-1750  cm-1, 
and the O-H stretch modes around 3000 cm-1 that are in reasonable agreement with the resonance 
Raman experiments.  19  To test whether the vibrational downshifts that we calculated originate 

simply  through  electrostatic  interactions  with  the  negative  charge  inside  the  cavity,  we  also 

calculated  the  IR-Raman  spectra  for  embedded  neutral  clusters  having  exactly  the  same 

geometry  as  the  water  anion  clusters  with  a  point  negative  charge  at  X.    Figure  12  presents  a 

comparison  of  the  vibrational  spectra  for  these  ‘point  charge’  clusters  (dashed  curve)  and 

‘hydrated electron’ clusters (solid curve); the corresponding band centroids are given in Table 2.  

The  comparison  clearly  suggests  that  electrostatic  interactions  alone  cannot  account  for  the 

downshift of the vibration bands; it is the mixing of the excess electron’s wavefunction with the 

frontier molecular orbitals of the first-shell water molecules that weakens the bonds and leads to 

the lower vibrational frequencies.  The magnitude of our calculated downshifts can be estimated 
from the data in Table 2.  The calculated downshift for the H-O-H bending mode is ca. 50-60 cm-
1 (as compared to the experimental estimate of 30 cm-1); 19,20 the calculated downshift for the O-
H stretching modes is 80-180 cm-1 (as compared to the experimental estimate of 200 cm-1 for the 
band  center).  19  Thus,  although  our  DFT  estimates  for  band  downshifts  using  optimized 

octahedral  water  clusters  are  closer  to  experiment,  it  appears  that  the  hybrid  embedded  water 

anion  model,  despite  its  many  approximations,  accounts  reasonably  well  for  the  observed 

features of the resonance Raman spectra of the 

hyde

. 

The plots of vibrational density of states (VDOS) for anion and neutral clusters (Figure 
16S) reveal a large peak at 100 cm-1 (3 THz) corresponding to low-amplitude motions of water 
molecules  relative  to  the  cavity  (which  is  in  the  same  25-75  cm-1  range  as  the  symmetric 
“breathing”  mode    predicted  by  Copeland  et  al.  36).  No  definitive  signature  of  these  low-

frequency  vibrations  was  found  in  autocorrelation  functions  for  orbital  and  transition  energies 

and the radius of gyration. Rapid exchange of water molecules occurring on the sub-picosecond 

time scale is the likely culprit. 

4. Concluding remarks. 

26 

-
 

In  this  paper,  we  have  shown  that  a  combined  DFT-  and  CIS-MQC  MD  approach  can 

account,  at  least  semiquantitatively,  and  in  many  instances,  quantitatively,  for  all  of  the 

experimentally observed features of the ground-state 

: these include the optical spectra in the 

hyde

visible and the UV, the vibrational spectra, and the EPR and ESEEM spectra.  As far as we are 

aware,  no  other  theoretical  approaches  suggested  have  provided  such  a  comprehensive 

description  of  the  hydrated  electron’s  properties.  The  salient  feature  found  from  our 

multielectron model of the 

 is that a considerable (ca. 18%) fraction of the excess electron’s 

hyde

density  resides  in  the  frontal  O  2p  orbitals  of  oxygen  atoms  in  the  hydrating  OH  groups.    Not 

only  does  this  sharing  not  contradict  any  experimental  observations,  but  this  sharing  naturally 

accounts  for  the  magnetic  resonance  spectra  and  the  downshifts  of  the  water  vibrational 

frequencies seen in resonance Raman experiments on the 

hyde

.  

Despite  the  extensive  spin  and  charge  sharing,  the  average  ground  and  excited-state 

orbitals resemble in their general appearance the s- and p-like states in the one-electron models.  

This  rationalizes  the  success  of  such  models  in  explaining  the  energetics  and  main  spectral 

features  of  the 

hyde

.    The  DFT  calculations  also  reproduce  some  other  features  seen  in  one-

electron models, such as the facts that the gyration ellipsoid is aspherical, the lower three excited 

‘p-states’  are  nondegenerate  and  extend  beyond  the  solvation  cavity,  and  that  the  transition 

dipole moments to these three ‘p-states’ are nearly orthogonal.  On the other hand, the nature of 

these  ‘p-states’  in  our  DFT  calculations  is  somewhat  different  from  that  predicted  by  one-

electron  models;  we  find  that  the  transition  dipole  moment  results  largely  from  the  electronic 

polarization of the cavity (because half of the frontier O 2p orbitals assume positive and another 

half negative sign).  Our calculations also predict that photoexcitation changes the most probable 

electron distance from 1.72 Å from the cavity center to 3.3 Å, with most of the electron density 

contained  in  the  interstitial  voids  between  the  water  molecules  of  the  first  and  the  second 

solvation shells (only 20% of the excited electron’s density resides inside the cavity, vs. the ca. 

100% predicted from one-electron approaches).  By contrast, 60% of the density of the ground 

‘s-state’ is  confined inside the  cavity and 80% is confined  within the first solvation shell. This 

tight electron localization justifies the embedded cluster approach used in this study. 

27

Our DFT calculations also provide an assignment for the 190 nm absorption band of the 
hydrated electron, 18 which has not been accounted for in one-electron models. Our calculations 

suggest that the presence of the negative charge inside the cavity makes the orbital energies of 

the valence electron in water molecules in the first solvation shell ca. 1.1 eV more positive than 

in  liquid  water.    We  thus  assign  the  UV  band  of  the  hydrated  electron  as  originating  from  an 

electron  transition  from  a  Stark-shifted  1b1  orbital  of  the  first-shell  water  molecules  to  the 

HOMO. 

We also see that spin sharing of the excess electron by O 2p orbitals of the first and, to a 
lesser  degree,  the  second  solvation  shells  results  in  large  hyperfine  coupling  constants  for  17O 

nuclei  in  these  molecules.    We  demonstrated  how  the  seemingly  contradictory  EPR  results  of 
Schlick et al.  5 for  17O-enriched alkaline glass samples can be accounted for in the DFT model.  

It  appears  that  fast  paramagnetic  relaxation  and  extreme  broadening  of  EPR  lines  from  the 
hydrated electrons involving  17O nuclei in the first solvation shell bias the observation towards 
the  isotope  configurations  in  which  no  17O  nuclei  are  present  in  this  shell.    With  these 

assumptions,  we  were  able  to  quantitatively  account  for  the  linewidths  of  the  EPR  spectra  for 

trapped 

hyde

, 4,5 both with and without 17O enrichment.  The same DFT calculations also account 

for all of the important features of the ESEEM spectra, 2,6 including line widths and the presence 

of high frequency bands that up until now have not been explained. We believe that the residual 

disagreement  between  our  calculations  and  experiment  stems  from  the  fact  that  our  MQC  MD 
calculations are based on a pseudopotential 23 that slightly overestimates the size of the solvation 

cavity,  resulting  in  reduced  isotropic  and  anisotropic  hfcc’s  as  compared  to  the  experiment.  

Alternatively, the structure of the alkaline glass might be different from liquid water, resulting in 

tighter solvation cavities. 

 

Our DFT calculations also yielded significant downshifts for all of the vibrational modes 

in the water molecules forming the solvation cavity.  None of the shifts observed in our model 

can be accounted for by a simple electrostatic interaction with a point charge at the cavity center: 

instead,  the  observed  changes  in  the  vibrational  modes  result  from  the  presence  of  the  excess 

electron  density  in  the  O  2p  orbitals.    The  magnitude  of  our  calculated  downshifts  compare 
favorably  to  those  determined  experimentally.  19    For  electrons  trapped  at  the  surface  of  small 

water  anion  clusters,  a  similar  view  (red  shifts  originating  from  donor-acceptor  stabilization 

28 

-
between the unpaired electron and O-H s * orbitals) has been recently suggested by Herbert and 
Head-Gordon. 37  

 

 

In conclusion, we believe that our hybrid DFT(CIS)-MQC MD model not only captures 

all of the salient features of one-electron models of 

, but presents a further refinement of the 

hyde

picture of electron hydration in general and provides, for the first time, a consistent explanation 

of those properties of  

 that cannot be addressed using one-electron models.  Our DFT(CIS)-

hyde

MQC  MD  model  suggests  that  the  traditional  cavity  picture  of 

  is  incomplete:    the  excess 

hyde

electron  cannot  be  considered  fully  independently  of  the  valence  electrons  in  water  molecules.  
Thus, we view the ‘hydrated electron’ as a kind of multimer radical anion  38 of water in which 

the electron wavefunction is shared between the cavity and the water molecules forming it.  Just 
such a picture has been advocated by Symons 39 and, later on, by Kevan. 3

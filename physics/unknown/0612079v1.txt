1. Introduction 

 

During  the  last  decades  the  high  mountain  observatories  have  been  exploited  not  only  for 

cosmic  ray  and  astroparticle  studies  but  for  environmental  studies  and  observations  of  the 

Sun-Earth  system.  In  this  connection  the  Basic  Environmental  Observatory  BEO  Moussala 

(the general view of the station in shown Fig. 1) located on the top of the highest mountain at 

Balkan Peninsula, precisely  at 2925m above sea  level is a privileged place for such type of 

investigations.  

This  is  one  of  the  most  proper  places  in  the  region  of  Balkans  with  relatively  small 

anthropogenic  influence  and  therefore  gives  excellent  possibility  for  high-mountain 

monitoring  i.e.  possibilities  for  monitoring  for  changes  and  processes  in  the  atmosphere,  as 

example  the  air-transport,  aerosol  and  UV  measurements,  changes  of  gamma-background, 

                                                 
* This work summarize the presentations at 20th European Cosmic Ray Symposium in Lisbon, Portugal September 5th-8th 2006 and 
International Symposium on Recent Observations and Simulations of the Sun-Earth System Varna Bulgaria September 17th-22th, 2006

dose-rate,  trans-border  pollutants  transfer  etc…  At  the  same  time  the  BEO  Moussala  gives 

possibility  to  exploit  the  secondary  cosmic  ray  neutron  and  muon  flux,  the  atmospheric 

Cherenkov  light  in  attempt  to  study  different  problems  of  cosmic  rays,  space  weather  and 

connections of the Sun-Earth system.  

The detailed analyses of the collected data give information about possible relation between 

very different kind of parameters and factors. Generally the following specific objectives are 

pursued in attempt to provide basic information permitting analysis of the connection between 

cosmic ray variation and several atmospheric parameters. The aim is the detailed, precise and 

contemporary  measurements  of  cosmic  ray  intensity  especially  the  muon,  electron,  gamma 

and  neutron  component  and  the  atmospheric  Cherenkov  light.  At  the  same  time  the 

atmosphere  parameters,  including  anthropogenic  products  as  well  in  different  conditions  of 

altitude, latitude and urban development is needed.

In the last years one of the most existing topics in the area of Sun-Earth system investigations 

is  the  possible  influence  of  cosmic  ray  on  terrestrial  atmosphere,  precisely  the  connection 

between low energy cosmic ray and the Earth atmosphere. As example the variations of the 

cosmic  rays  may  be  responsible  for  the  changes  in  the  large-scale  atmospheric  circulation 

associated with solar activity phenomena [1, 2]. Presently several arguments claims that the 

Solar activity affects the global climate in different aspects and timescales. One possibility is 

based on climate response to changes in the cosmic ray flux and radiative budget [3]. This is 

connected  with  the  tropospheric  response  to  solar  variability  precisely  the  heating  of  the 

troposphere  during  solar  maximum.  This  is  related  with  the  modulation  of  the  large-scale 

tropospheric circulation systems [4]. Additionally the stratospheric ozone plays important role 

on  the  modulation  of  the  radiative  influence  of  the  climate.  [5].  A  powerful  tool  for 

investigations  from  Earth  the  variation  of  cosmic  ray  flux  is  based  on  registration  of 

secondary  cosmic  ray  neutrons  and  muons  [1].  Moreover  among  the  different  proposed 

mechanisms  as  example  the  UV  heating  of  the  stratosphere  [2]  or  change  of  the  solar 

irradiance  [6]  the  influence  of  cosmic  ray  to  cloud  formation  [7,  8]  seems  to  be  most 

promising  at  experimental  point  of  view  and  existing  and  in  development  devices  at  BEO 

Moussala.  

Therefore the precise and contemporary measurements of secondary cosmic ray neutrons and 

muons are very important. At the same time such type of measurements gives good basis for 

study  of  solar-terrestrial  influences  and  space  weather.  Moreover  the  ability  to  forecast  for 

long term space weather needs a precise knowledge of solar activity.  

The space weather refers to conditions on the sun, solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere and 

ionosphere [9]. Several characteristic signatures in cosmic ray may be used for space weather 

applications [10] on the basis of secondary cosmic ray neutron data. Good examples are the 

solar proton events and Geomagnetic storms.  

One  of  the  significant  points  is  related  with  the  atmospheric  transparency  and  cloud 

formation. As was mentioned above the variations of the cosmic rays, both solar and galactic 

may be responsible for the changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation. It is possible to 

associate such type of phenomena with solar activity and precisely with the energy of cosmic 

particles being 0.1–1 GeV [7, 11]. It is obvious that possible mechanism of cosmic ray effects 

on  the  lower  atmosphere  involves  changes  in  the  atmospheric  transparency  which  is 

connected with cloud cover. This is possibly due to the changes in the stratospheric ionization 

produced  by  the  considered  cosmic  particles.  Moreover  cosmic  ray  reflects  on  the 

 

3

atmospheric  temperature  assuming  mechanisms  related  with  cloud  formation  that  may  be 

associated with the changes in the ionization of the stratosphere during the solar cosmic ray 

bursts [12]. With this in mind in this paper are presented several of the activities and recent 

results from BEO Moussala. 

2. Atmospheric transparency measurements  

 

The transparency is one of the primary measures of the  atmospheric state. The  precise long 

term  series  of  atmospheric  transparency  measurements  gives  the  possibility  for  quantitative 

estimate of the variability of air and therefore to make climatologic conclusions with regard to 

contamination,  cloud  formation,  humidity  and  radiative  exchange.  Therefore  it  is  very 

important to provide measurements of the integral atmospheric transparency.  

It seems to be possible to estimate the atmospheric transparency on the basis of atmospheric 

Cherenkov 

light 

registration 

(Fig.2.),  additional  measurements  with  LIDAR  and 

corresponding  Monte  Carlo  simulations.  The  atmospheric  Cherenkov  light  is  produced  by 

charged  ultra  relativistic  particles  in  extensive  air  showers  (EAS)  [13].  The  majority  of  the 

Cherenkov  photons  are  produced  near  to  the  shower  maximum  [14].  Thus  in  practice  the 

totality  of  the  Cherenkov  light  passes  trough  the  lower  atmosphere.  Obviously  the 

atmospheric condition plays an important role and impacts the Cherenkov light propagation.  

The registration of atmospheric Cherenkov light is possible using Cherenkov telescope. This 

device in our case represents system of two parabolic mirrors with focal length of 1.5m and 

diameter of 2m working in a coincidence regime (Fig.3.). Measuring the Cherenkov light flux 

produced in EAS in different atmospheric conditions one obtains different amplitude spectra. 

Obviously this reflects on the slope of the reconstructed spectrum. The different slopes of the 

reconstructed  spectra  correspond  obviously  to  different  atmospheric  conditions.  Thus  it  is 

possible to check the different absorption mechanisms measuring the atmospheric Cherenkov 

light. Moreover such type of experiment gives the excellent possibility to study the different 

atmospheric profiles using additional measurement with LIDAR or starlight extinction [19].  

Generally two kinds of scattering are important: scattering by molecules of air, and scattering 

by solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in the air. Molecular scattering is usually called 

Rayleigh  scattering.  The  suspended  particles,  on  the  other  hand,  are  collectively  known  as 

aerosols, and their contribution is called aerosol scattering.

In. Fig. 4 is shown the measured amplitude spectrum in cloudless condition. One can see the 

apparatus  noise,  the  threshold  and  real  counts  used  for  reconstruction.  It  is  important  to 

compare such type of measurements with theoretical estimations or Monte Carlo simulations 

and of course with measurements based on different methods and techniques. 

In  this  connection  an  additional  Monte  Carlo  simulation  using  CORSIKA  6.002  code  [15] 

with  GHEISHA  [16]  and  QGSJET  [17]  hadronic  interaction  subroutines  have  been  carried 

out. The aim is in one hand to estimate the detector energy threshold and on the other hand to 

study  the  amplitude  spectra  in  different  atmospheric  conditions.  The  simulated  primary 
particles are protons with initial energy of 5x1012 eV and distributed according spectrum with 

slope  of  2.7.  The  American  standard  atmosphere  was  used  for  the  simulations.  The 

simulations were carried out in two cases – transparent atmosphere i.e. without any absorption 

or  scattering  of  the  light.  The  second  case  was  with  included  Mie  and  Rayleigh  scattering 

according [18].

The  results  of  the  simulation  are  presented  in  fig.  5.  As  a  results  the  estimated  energy 
threshold of the telescope is 5x1013 eV energy of the primary particle which induce the EAS.  

The  first  experimental  results  confirmed  the  expectations  concerning  the  different  counting 

rates and slopes of the reconstructed spectra. However additional calculations will be needed. 

The aim is to obtain precisely the effective detector area as a function of the energy threshold 

of  the  telescope  and  different  atmospheric  conditions  and  profiles.  This  will  permit  to 

reconstruct  the  measured  amplitude  spectra  precisely  and  therefore  the  obtained  energy 

spectra  slopes.  Obviously  additional  measurements  will  be  needed  and  comparison  with 

LIDAR measurements in attempt to provide inter-calibration.

3. Neutron and muon flux measurements 

As  was  mentioned  the  solar  activity  can  affect  the  global  climate  in  different  aspects, 

timescales  trough  large  diversity  of  mechanisms.  Taking  into  account  that  the  secondary 

cosmic ray neutrons and muons are connected with cosmic rat variations it is possible to study 

such effects  on the basis of secondary cosmic ray muon and neutron flux  measurements. In 

this connection aiming to study the variations of primary cosmic ray a neutron flux meter and 

muon  telescope  based  on  water  Cherenkov  detectors  are  developed  at  BEO  Moussala.  The 

 

 

 
 

7

aim of both devices is to investigate the possible connection between cosmic ray and climate 

The muon telescope is based on 8 water Cherenkov detectors. The water Cherenkov detector 

is  a  tank  with  50x50x12cm  (Fig.6).  The  principal  aim  is  to  investigate  the  variations  of 

changes [19]. 

cosmic ray. 

Fig.6 Water Cherenkov detector of the muon telescope 

 

The  tank  efficiency  registration  was  estimated  with  modified  version  of  EGS4  code  [20], 

precisely version with included Cherenkov effect [21]. Using the simulations with CORSIKA 

6.002  code  [15]  with  corresponding  hadronic  interaction  models  GHEISHA  [16]  for  low 

energy  interaction  below  80  GeV/nucleon  and  QGSJET  [17]  for  high  energy  hadronic 

interaction  the  distribution  of  muon  component  at  BEO  Moussala  observation  level  was 

obtained. This permitted taking into account the concrete layer of the observatory to estimate 

the expected counting rate of the muon telescope for energy threshold of GeV. This permits to 

provide  measurements  with  high  statistics  and  study  the  cosmic  ray  variations.  In  Fig.  7  is 

shown the muon telescope at the basement of the observatory.  

The recent results of the measurements are presented in Fig. 8 and Fig. 11. At the same time 

at  BEO  Moussala  is  operational  automatic  meteo-station  Vaissala  which  gives  information 

about  atmospheric  conditions  such  as  pressure,  temperature,  wind  direction  and  velocity 

etc…In  Fig.  9  and  Fig.  10  are  presented  the  average  of  the  atmospheric  pressure  and 

temperature for month of September 2006. Taking into account the results presented in Fig. 8 

one  can  conclude  that  the  muon  telescope  can  provide  precise  measurements  of  the  muon 

component of the secondary cosmic rays and thus gives the possibility to study the cosmic ray 

variation (detected pressure effect). Moreover registering the secondary cosmic ray muons it 

 

 

8

is possible to detect Forbush decrease. This permits to study the influence of galactic cosmic 

rays  on  the  solar  radiation  input  to  the  lower  atmosphere,  especially  increases  of  the  total 

radiation fluxes associated with Forbush-decreases in the galactic cosmic rays [22].

Additional measurements with Liulin LED spectrometer of the secondary cosmic ray particles 

flux shows good correlation with the muon telescope data (Fig. 12). 

Complementary to muon telescope a neutron flux meter is developed. It represents complex 
of six gas filled detectors type SNM-15 with BF3 enriched to 90% with B10. The detectors are 

situated  under  the  roof  of  the  main  building  of  BEO  Moussala.  The  detector  complex  is 

divided  in  two  modules  of  3  detectors.  In  Fig.  13  is  presented  the  front  panel  of  the  first 

module including the signal and power supply cables. The device is without lead i.e. is only 

with neutron moderator - glycerin. This is the main difference comparing to the usual neutron 

monitors. According the initial design [23, 24] the aim of the complex is to provide with high 

statistics  and  precision  measure  of  the  absolute  secondary  neutron  cosmic  ray  flux.  The 

scientific potential of detector complex is enormous. The relativistic cosmic rays both galactic 

and  solar  play  a  useful  key  in  space  weather  storms  forecasting  and  in  the  specification  of 

magnetic properties of coronal mass ejections, shocks and ground level enhancements [25]. 

Moreover it is possible to investigate the variations of the pressure level heights, temperature 

profiles  and  wind  characteristics  in  the  troposphere  and  lower  stratosphere  during  Forbush-

decreases  of  the  galactic  cosmic  rays  [26].  The  Forbush-decreases  are  accompanied  by  the 

pressure increase in the whole troposphere, the maximum of the effect taking place on the 3–

4th  day  after  the  event  onset.  Simultaneously  the  temperature  decrease  is  observed  in  the 

troposphere during the first few days of the Forbush-decreases. The pressure increase might 

be  related  to  the  changes  of  wind  characteristics  in  the  middle  and  upper  troposphere.  A 

possible mechanism of the observed effects seems to involve radiation budget changes in the 

atmosphere due to the cloudiness variations associated with Forbush-decreases of the galactic 

cosmic rays.  

At  the  same  time  the  precise  measurements  with  both  mentioned  above  devices  gives 

excellent possibility to understand the role of cosmic ray variation of the Earth climate and to 

check different mechanisms of such type of influence [27, 28].  

The  detailed  Monte  Carlo  simulation  of  the  detector  response  was  carried  out.  The  result  is 

the estimation in one hand the moderator layer of glycerin (12.5 cm) and on the other hand the 

expected counting rates at Moussala observation level of 2925m above sea level (725 g/cm2). 

In this study was used the measured at Testa Griggia neutron spectrum [29] (Fig. 14). In fig. 

15 are presented the results of simulation with MCNP(x) as a neutron total current function of 

the  moderator  layer.  The  12.5  cm  moderator  of  glycerin  permits  in  one  hand  to  avoid  the 

registration  of  neutrons  result  of  reaction  near  to  detector  and  on  the  other  hand  to  assure 

 

12

relatively high counting rate of the detector complex and thus to provide good statistics of the 

measurements.

The  preliminary  measurements  at  Sofia  observation  level  –  550  m  above  sea  level,  which 
corresponds  to  970  g/cm2  and  Moussala  observation  level  taking  into  account  the  detector 

efficiency [30] and more realistic geometry shows very good coincidence of the measured and 

simulated counting rates. The estimated counting rate for Sofia observation level is around 3 

neutrons/s for single detector as a total neutron current. The complex of 6 detectors gives an 

average  of  registered  events  approximatively  12  for  10  minutes  measurements.  Taking  into 

account  the  estimated  registration  efficiency  and  secondary  cosmic  ray  neutron  spectrum  at 

Sofia  observation  level  one  obtains  very  similar  counting  rate  for  simulated  and  measured 

rates. 

The  geomagnetic  and  radiation  storms  are  significant  elements  of  space  weather  [31].  The 

forecasting  of  such  type  of  events  is  very  important  for  orbiting  flights.  In  fact  the 

geomagnetic storms are driven by magnetized plasma clouds. They reach the Earth from few 

hours till several days. During their propagation they interact with galactic cosmic rays. The 

result  is  the  modulation  of  galactic  comic  rays  till  energies  of  thousands  of  GeV.  As  was 

mentioned  above  the  change  of  the  intensity  is  possible  to  detect  by  surface  monitors. 

Additionally muon detector network [32] can provide powerful tool for better understanding 

 

14

the space weather in the vicinity of Earth. At the same time sudden correlated measurements 

and analysis of the variation of secondary muon, neutron and electrons could be good basis 

for indication of upcoming geomagnetic storms. 

Therefore  for  real  time  studies  of  solar-terrestrial  relations  it  is  required  to  register 

simultaneously as more as possible of phenomena in heliosphere. In this connection it may be 

very  useful  to  use  ground-based  muon  hodoscope  with  high  angular  resolution  that  detects 

muons  of  cosmic  rays  with  energy  around  10GeV.  Solar  flares,  scattering  of  protons  by 

interplanetary shock waves, fluctuations of the air density distribution in the atmosphere will 

change ground level muon intensity. Amplitude of such variations can reach maximal value in 

various energy-active regions of the Earth near magnetic poles, tropics, sea coast of continents 

etc.  In  this  connection  a  good  solution  for  BEO  Moussala  will  be  the  development  of  Nor-

Ambered  multidirectional  muon  monitor  [33]  see Fig.  16.  The  detector  complex  consists  of 

two layers of plastic scintillators below and above of the sections of the Nor Ambered neutron 

monitor. The lead absorbs the low energy muons and the electronic component. The estimated 

threshold is around 350 MeV for detected muons.  

Fig. 16 Nor Amberd multidirectional neutron monitor [32] 

 

An  additional  device  which  will  be  complementary  is  the  muon  hodoscope  (Fig.  17). 

According  the  initial  design  [34]  the  muon  hodoscope  represents  multi-channel  device.  The 

complex is based on water Cherenkov detectors [19, 30] with cylindrical form and dimensions 

 

15

10 cm diameter and 1m length. The muon hodoscope is made of four layers with 128 counters 

in a layer. The distance between the two pairs of layers is 1 meter. The estimated registration 

efficiency  is  91%  assuming  5  GeV  energy  muons  for  threshold  and  using  model  [21].  The 

scientific potential is enormous starting from internal gravitational waves, measurement of the 

temperature field along height of the atmosphere, registration of acoustic waves [19] etc…

4. Summary 

In  this  work  are  presented  several  at  BEO  Moussala  activities  connected  with  secondary 

cosmic  ray  registration,  especially  the  atmospheric  Cherenkov  light,  neutron  and  muon 

component.  The  presented  activities  are  both  theoretical,  precisely  estimation  of  the  energy 

threshold, efficiency registration based on Monte Carlo simulations and experimental. Several 

preliminary  results  and  estimations  based  on  Monte  Carlo  simulation  with  CORSIKA  code 

were  carried  out  in  attempt  to  obtain  the  energy  threshold  of  the  atmospheric  Cherenkov 

telescope.  As  example  is  shown  measured  amplitude  spectrum.  The  future  plans  are 

connected  especially  with  more  precise  and  detailed  simulations  of  different  components  of 
EAS at Moussala observation level of 725 g/cm2. This will permit in one hand to obtain the 

effective  area  of  the  atmospheric  Cherenkov  light  telescope  and  therefore  to  provide  more 

precise analysis of the measured events. On the other hand this will permit to make detailed 

16

Monte  Carlo  simulation  of  the  detector  response  of  particle  detectors.  All  these  results  are 

good basis for building reconstruction strategy. 

The muon telescope based on water Cherenkov detectors is shown. The registration efficiency 

of single tank is obtained and the whole device efficiency is estimated. Several experimental 

results are shown.  

The neutron flux-meter is described with estimations concerning the final design. The Monte 

Carlo simulations and measured counting rates for Sofia observation level are compared. The 

Nor-Ambered  multidirectional  muon  monitor  and  muon  hodoscope  project  proposal  was 

mentioned. The scientific potential of all devices is discussed. It is clear that the high quality 

data can be useful as a basis to check several models on the influence of high energy particles 

on the middle atmosphere. A good example is presented in [19].

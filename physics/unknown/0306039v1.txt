Hot dense capsule implosions driven by z-pinch x-rays have been measured for the ﬁrst

time. A ~220 eV dynamic hohlraum imploded 1.7-2.1 mm diameter gas-ﬁlled CH capsules which

absorbed up to ~ 20 kJ of x-rays. Argon tracer atom spectra were used to measure the Te ~ 1 keV

electron temperature and the ne ~ 1-4 x 1023 cm-3 electron density. Spectra from multiple direc-

tions provide core symmetry estimates. Computer simulations agree well with the peak compres-

sion values of Te, ne, and symmetry, indicating reasonable understanding of the hohlraum and

implosion physics.

Implosion of spherical capsules by x-rays contained in an enclosure known as a hohlraum is the

baseline approach for achieving inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) [1]. These implosions provide a

platform for high energy density physics investigations and may enable studies of matter at condi-

tions similar to stellar interiors. One method for generating the required high energy density x-rays

is the z-pinch dynamic hohlraum (ZPDH) [2-4]. Accelerating an annular high-atomic-number z-

pinch plasma onto a low-atomic-number low-density cylindrical foam creates this type of hohl-

raum. The z-pinch plasma impact onto the foam launches a radiating shock that propagates toward

the cylinder axis and heats the hohlraum. The z-pinch plasma traps the radiation, improving the

symmetry for driving capsule implosions at the center of the hohlraum. In this Letter we describe

the ﬁrst x-ray measurements of hot dense implosion cores produced using z-pinch radiation drive.

ICF requires highly-symmetric capsule implosions. Absorption of 150 kJ of x-ray energy in a

carefully-shaped pulse with ~ 1-3 % spatial symmetry is estimated to be sufﬁcient for ignition [1].

The appeal of the ZPDH approach is efﬁcient generation and delivery of x-rays to the capsule.

Indeed, the capsules in the experiments reported here absorbed up to 20 kJ of x-rays, about 1/8 of

the estimated ignition requirement. However, it remains to be seen whether adequate symmetry

and temporal pulse shaping control can be obtained. The experiments reported here represent an

important step toward ZPDH symmetry control.

Recent work [5-6] demonstrated reasonable ZPDH performance understanding. The effect of

random z-pinch non-uniformities on the shock radiation source was found very small. The system-

atic asymmetries must now be addressed. The cylindrical ZPDH tends to drive the spherical cap-

sule with equator-hot radiation that, if uncorrected, will produce an implosion elongated along the

cylinder axis. Symmetry corrections, including radiation shields, non-cylindrical foams, and local

foam dopants, require diagnostics capable of measuring the alteration’s effect. Published laser

driven implosions [7] showed that x-ray core imaging measurements of the equatorial plane radius

(a) compared to the polar radius (b) reﬂected the x-ray drive asymmetry. Applying this method to

the ZPDH is complicated by the difﬁculty of viewing the implosion through the luminous high-

opacity z-pinch plasma (Fig. 1). We consequently employed time- and space-resolved x-ray spec-

tra from tracer atoms in the core to ensure that the measurements reﬂect the core conditions. This

requires two separate spectrometers, one viewing along the polar axis and one viewing in the equa-

torial plane, since each instrument records only 1D spatial information. The equatorial-to-polar

radius ratio can be measured by comparing the two spectra. These spectra lay the foundation for a

tomographic reconstruction of the 2-D electron density (ne) and temperature (Te) spatial proﬁles

within the implosion core. In addition, ne and Te measurements provide a benchmark of how close

the conditions are to ICF requirements and can test whether ZPDH simulations are accurate, since

they depend on the drive radiation time history.

In this Letter we describe sample results from two experiment groups. The goal for the ﬁrst

group was single-minded: maximizing the likelihood of measuring core x-ray emission. The

experiment representing the ﬁrst group, Z860, had a 1.7 mm outer diameter, a 36 µm CH wall, and

a 4 µm Polyvinylalcohol (PVA) overcoat to retain the ﬁll gas. The ﬁll was 2.8 atm CD4 + 0.085

atm Ar. CD4 was chosen to avoid the difﬁculty of retaining D2 inside large-diameter thin-CH-wall

The second group of experiments used a larger capsule and a lower-Z ﬁll gas to increase the Ar

emission intensity. This allowed improvements to the polar diagnostics and we implemented a

spectrometer viewing along the equator, through the z-pinch plasma. The experiment representing

this second group, Z962, used a capsule with a 2.1 mm diameter, a 39 µm CH wall, and a 4 µm

PVA overcoat followed by an 800 Angstrom Al overcoat. The ﬁll gas was 13.5 atm D2 + 0.085 atm

capsules.

Ar.

The experiments used the Z facility [2,3] to drive a ZPDH conﬁguration [3,5,8] composed of

concentric annular tungsten wire arrays with a 240-wire 40-mm-diameter outer array and a 120-

wire 20-mm-diameter inner array. The wire diameter was 7.5 µm. The 14 mg/cc CH2 foam was 6

mm diameter, 10 mm tall on Z860, and 12 mm tall on Z962. Polar line of sight measurements were

performed through a 4-mm-diameter aperture that was covered with a 4 µm Ti + 2 µm CH foil to

reduce symmetry perturbations. The time-dependent radiation temperature, shock, and capsule

radius were diagnosed using x-ray imaging and power measurements [5,8,9]. The ~ 18 Mbar

shock had a ~ 35 cm/µsec velocity and the peak radiation drive temperature was ~ 220 eV, prior to

the arrival of the shock on axis. The radiation temperature rise time was ~7 ns. The capsule core x-

ray emission peaked 2-3 ns before shock arrival on axis and 4-5 ns prior to z-pinch stagnation. The

times given below are with respect to z-pinch stagnation, as deﬁned in [8]. The diagnostic suite

[10] included capsule implosion time measurements using ﬁltered photoconducting diodes and

both activation and time-of-ﬂight neutron detectors. The neutron yield was ~2x1010 on Z962, sim-

ilar to the 1D simulation yield. The Z860 yield was below the ~ 3x109 detector threshold. Detailed

comparisons of measured and simulated neutron yields and the dynamic hohlraum radiation tem-

perature and hydrodynamics will be described elsewhere.

Here we emphasize the results obtained from two time- and space-resolved elliptical crystal

spectrometers [11] (TREX1 and TREX2) and a time-resolved x-ray pinhole camera (TRPHC1

[10]). The TREX1 spectrometer viewed the capsule along the polar axis (Fig. 1). It used an array

of six space-resolving slits to project spectrally-resolved images of the capsule onto six 1-nsec

time-gated microchannel plate (MCP) striplines. On Z860 and Z962 the spatial resolution was ~

330 µm and ~120 µm, respectively. The PET crystal located 2.92 m from the source provided a 1.3

Angstrom spectral range and a spectral resolution of λ/δλ ~ 860. The TREX2 spectrometer viewed

the capsule from the side. The instrument components, spectral range, and resolution were the

same as for TREX1, except that the source to crystal distance was 4.10 m and the spatial resolution

was ~ 200 µm. The data are recorded on Kodak TMAX p3200 ﬁlm. We unfold the ﬁlm response

using a step wedge, apply the wavelength scale, and account for the relative instrument sensitivity

[11]. The TRPHC1 viewed the capsule from the end of the ZPDH, at a 6 degree angle with respect

to the ZPDH axis. It used 11 time frames with a 1 ns gate, a 1 ns interframe time, and a ~160 µm

spatial resolution.

On Z860 TREX1 recorded Ar spectra in time frames 1 & 2 (Fig. 2). The emission spatial

extent was ~ 300 µm, demonstrating that the Ar spectra arise from a well-localized implosion core.

A TRPHC1 image recorded simultaneously with the TREX1 frame 1 spectrum (Fig. 3) conﬁrmed

that the implosion occurred when the shock in the foam was still at a ~ 1.8 mm diameter. The

implosion was therefore radiation driven.

The TREX1 data (Fig. 2) are qualitatively similar to laser hohlraum implosion data [12]. The

electron density (ne) was determined from a “line of best ﬁt” analysis [13] of the Stark- and opac-

ity-broadened He-like and H-like Ar line sequences. This analysis determines the nli

δr product as

well as ne, where nli is the lower level population of ion charge state i and δr is the plasma size

along the line of sight. The ne inferred from the Z860 TREX1 frame 1 data was 1.3 + 0.3 x1023

3
cm-3, corresponding to a mass density ρ ~ 0.35 g/cm

. The compressed fuel ρr obtained from the

δr product was 9 mg/cm2, under the assumption that the Ar concentration was preserved. The

nli

values obtained from the frame 2 data were ne ~ 3.2 + 0.4 x1023 cm-3, ρ ~ 0.86 g/cm3, and ρr ~ 5

mg/cm2. The nli

δr values lead to Ar line center optical depths of τ ~ 50-100 for the Heα and Lyα,

τ~ 3 for the Heβ and Lyβ, and τ ~ 0.3 – 1.0 for the Heγ and Lyγ lines.

An estimate for the radial compression (Cr) can be obtained from the ratio of the compressed

core density compared with the initial density and assuming a spherical implosion. The frames 1

and 2 TREX1 data correspond to Cr~5.4 and Cr~7.2, respectively. The actual shape of the implo-

sion is expected to be prolate, since no symmetry corrections were employed here. This is a likely

explanation for the small radial size (Cr ~ 10) observed in the TRPHC1 image (Fig. 3).

Te was determined by comparing measurements of spectral line ratios to calculations per-

formed with the non-LTE collisional-radiative SPECT3D model [14]. The model accounts for

plasma opacity and our analysis assumed a uniform steady-state Maxwellian plasma. We used

both the Lyγ/Heγ and the (He-like satellites to Lyα)/(Li-like satellites to Heα) line ratios. These

ratios were selected for their robustness against complications arising from optical thickness and

atomic kinetics uncertainties. The electron temperature was Te ~ 800 + 70 eV for both frames 1

and 2. In spite of the uniform core approximation, the complete measured frame 1 spectrum agrees

well with a synthetic SPECT3D spectrum calculated with ne=1x1023 cm-3, Te = 800 eV, and ρr =

5.3 mg/cm2. However, the high-n lines are not well reproduced in a similar frame 2 comparison.

Also, the frame 2 spectrum is ~5x weaker than in frame 1. A preliminary interpretation is that a

small residual hot core emits the frame 2 spectral lines through a cool outer layer that has enough

ground state Ar population to attenuate the resonance transitions.

The ZPDH radiation and material properties were calculated [6] with 2-D LASNEX [15] simu-

lations that use the multi-group diffusion radiation transport approximation, treating the electrodes

as a boundary with a speciﬁed time-dependent albedo, and treating the capsule as a loss in the cen-

tral zones. They also neglect Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, an approximation justiﬁed by Ref.

[5,6,8]. The radiation ﬁeld at the capsule location was calculated by integrating the radiation trans-

port equation within the ZPDH. This radiation was averaged over the capsule surface and used as

input for 1-D simulations of the capsule implosion. The post-processed simulation implosion core

Te and ne are compared with the experimental results in Fig. 4. The simulation relative timing was

established using the ZPDH shock trajectory measured using time-resolved x-ray imaging. The

simulation ne and Te values agree with the experiment at peak core emission intensity. The 0.5 ns

timing difference is comparable to the experiment uncertainty. The simulations do not reproduce

the residual hot core that is inferred from the frame 2 data, although the ne rise is very similar to

the experiment.

On Z962 spectra were recorded on TREX1 frames 4, 5, and 6 and on TREX2 frame 6 (Figs. 1,

5). The spectral intensity in TREX1 frames 4 and 5 were weaker than the frame 6 spectra by fac-

tors of ~ 250 and 10, respectively. The tungsten plasma opacity prevented observation of the weak

frame 4 & 5 signals on TREX2. The spatially-averaged core Te and ne values determined from the

Fig. 5 data using the methods outlined above are shown in Fig. 4. The compressed fuel density at

the time of peak emission (frame 6) was ne = 1.3 + 0.2 x1023 cm-3 (ρ ~ 0.44 g/cm3), the areal den-

sity was ρr ~8.7 mg/cm2, and the 1D fuel convergence was Cr ~ 5.5. The simulation peak Te agrees

with the data, while ne is about 0.6 times the experiment value (Fig. 4). The emission peaks

approximately 0.5 ns later in the simulation. Also, the data indicate that a relatively small amount

of fuel is heated to high temperatures ~2 ns before the emission peaks, a feature not reproduced in

the simulations. The absorbed x-ray energy in the Z962 simulations was ~20 kJ, to our knowledge

approximately an order of magnitude higher than in prior [1] laser hohlraum implosions. The drive

radiation burns through these relatively thin wall capsules when the capsule has imploded to

approximately one-half the initial radius. The absorbed energy is dominated by the capsule inter-

nal energy, which is proportional to the drive temperature at the peak compression. Increasing

(decreasing) the drive temperature will tend to make the implosion occur earlier (later), making the

calculated absorbed energy insensitive to drive uncertainties.

Symmetry estimates can be obtained by comparing space-direction lineouts from the two slit-

imaged spectra (Fig. 1). Example lineouts taken through the continuum between the Lyδ and Lyγ

transitions are shown in Fig. 6. Results of post-processed 2D implosion simulations are superim-

posed on the measurements. The 2D capsule simulations were driven by the time- and angle-

dependent radiation obtained in separate ZPDH simulations [6]. The simulations have a com-

pressed size at peak emission that is larger than the experiment by a factor of ~1.2 (Fig. 6), consis-

tent with the lower simulation electron density. However, the fwhm ratio a/b measured in the polar

and equatorial planes is in excellent agreement with the experiment (Fig. 6).

The results demonstrate that the ZPDH can produce diagnosable hot and dense capsule implo-

sions. The large absorbed energy supports the inherent energy efﬁciency of this approach. Work is

in progress to exploit the understanding and the measurement techniques developed here to

improve the implosion symmetry and increase the coupled x-ray energy.

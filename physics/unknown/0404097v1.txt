Abstract.  

The efficient optical tool for elimination of the phase and amplitude distortions produced by 

imperfectness  of  the  optical  elements  in  microscope  lightpath  considered.  This  robust 

procedure  described by simple theoretical  model proved to be successful to repair the noisy 

images with noise to signal ratio close to 100. It is shown that Van Cittert - Zernike theorem 

provides  adequate  description  of  imperfect  microscope  operating  under  both  coherent  and 

incoherent illumination conditions and having turbid media in object and intermediate planes.  

Introduction. 

The optical images in fluorescence microscopy are affected by a number of factors: among 

them are the phase and amplitude distortions in the object plane or in the intermediate planes, produced 

by inhomogeneous flow or turbid particles inside the liquid, surrounding the object. In the typical 

experimental setup (fig.1) for both trans- and epi - fluorescence microscopy the light from spatially 

coherent (laser) or incoherent (gas-discharge lamp, like tungsten or xenon one) source passes through 

the object and acquires some amplitude and phase information concerning the object itself and the 

properties of the microscope components.

These optical components, forming image, namely lenses and mirrors, introduce also both the 

phase  distortions,  caused  by  imperfectness  of  the  surfaces,  and  amplitude  distortions,  induced  by 

corrupted reflectivity or dense concentration of a dust particles. Thus in addition to diffractive spread 

of  ideal microscope response function there is a set of additional factors reducing the image quality. 

These factors are modelled  below as random noise field 

)(rN (cid:0)

 . 

It is well known the quality  of image could be substantially  enhanced by spatial filtering on 

the purely “hardware” level, introducing spatial filters/3/, on purely “software” level, by making some 

digital manipulations with arrays of numbers, produced by detection of the image via analog or digital 

devices  or methods of adaptive optics,  which are in fact the combination of two methods, mentioned 

above,  for  example  by  using  some  deformable  optical  elements,  controlled  by  computer  through 

specially  developed  feedback.  The  goal  of  the  present  paper  is to  describe  practically  convinient  and 

robust setup for noise elimination from microscopical image by confocal spatial filter and to support it 

within framework of simple theoretical model.  

Basic Equations. 

In  the  scalar  diffraction  approximation  the  structure  of  the  optical  image  is  given  by  the 

following convolution equation/1,2/:

sequence  of  optical  elements,  described  as  amplitude  –  phase  screens.  For  example,  in  paraxial 

approximation  the lens has transfer  function in the  form  of  imaginary  exponent  with  parabolic  phase

Confocal spatial filtering . 

( )rN (cid:6)

The  noise  random  field 

  affects  the  quality  of  image,  introducing  the  significant  spread  of 

Fourier spatial spectrum. It is shown on the fig.2 by numerical modeling on 128 x 128 mesh as image 

of the object in the form of rectangular carpet is distorted by additive Rayleigh noise/2/. In our model 

we  used  quite  general,  additive    model  of  noise/3/,  taking  into  account  both  phase  and  amplitude  

distortions. The latter, for example, could be initiated by dust particles on surfaces of the microscope 
components, introducing  d  -like randomly located obstacles. The total intensity associated  with noise 

term  exceeded  100  times  the  intensity  of  the  “carpet”. The  usage  of  additional  confocal  spatial  filter 

enhanced  filtering  action of microscope  itself . The image had been restored  with correlation 90%, 

compared to initial image at the expense of signal losses at 50 % level.

The qualitative agreement with results of Sheppard and Gauderon /4/ had been obtained. The signal to 

noise ratio S/N   had been calculated using equation (3) on the 128 x 128 numerical mesh. The signal-

to-noise ratio as a function of diaphragm width has maximum near boundary of the spatial spectrum of 

the signal. For the smaller diameters the  S/N   drops to zero linearly. 

Bioimaging  with confocal spatial filtering  
and commercial digital camera. 
 

 
The inverted microscope with 10x objective had been improved by confocal filter for observation of 
hyppocampal slices. Fig.3 shows the general view of the microscope field (diameter of the working 
area 18 mm) through 5x lupa, obtained by HP Photosmart – 320 digital camera ( 2 Megapixel, 
maximum resolution 1200 x 1600 ) .

The  further    observations  had  been  made  with  the  10x  objective  and  Genius  WEB  –  cam  with 
resolution  300x200  pixels  and  manual  focusing.  The  total  field  of  view  in  present  frames  is 
approximately 400 m m (see fig.6 below).   
 
The two slices illuminated with different UV filters  at 380 and 360 nm  are shown in fig.6.

Thus we see that confocal spatial filtering provided reasonable image quality with commercial CCD – 

camera under incoherent continuous illumination.

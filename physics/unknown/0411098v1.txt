The classical edge-wave problem is addressed by scaling the governing equations, for 
small slope (ε) at the shore, according to the exact edge-wave solution (for uniform 
slope) which is based on the Gerstner solution of the water-wave problem. The bottom is 
allowed to be any suitable profile which varies on the scale of this small parameter; a 
multiple-scale method is then employed to construct the solution. The leading-order 
equations – which are a version of the shallow-water equations – are fully nonlinear, but 
an appropriate exact travelling-wave solution exists; the next term in the asymptotic 
expansion, valid for ε→ 0 , is also found and, from this, uniformity conditions are 
deduced. The results are used to describe the run-up pattern produced by edge waves at 
the shoreline, based on any mode other than the first; this pattern corresponds closely 
with what is observed, and also with the exact solution for uniform slope everywhere. 
The surface wave, from the shoreline, seawards, is described for various depth profiles 
(such as a constant depth at infinity or with a sand bar close inshore). The problem for the 
first mode, which corresponds to a non-uniformity in the expansion, is briefly discussed; 
in this case it is not possible to find an exact closed-form solution. 
 
The corresponding analysis in the case when a longshore current (varying on the same 
scale as the depth) is flowing, in addition to a general depth profile, is also presented, and 
the notion of an effective depth profile is confirmed. Finally, a brief mention is made of 
model equations for edge waves (which have single-mode exact solutions); these may 
provide the basis for further investigations into the interaction of modes. 

1. Introduction 

The edge-wave solution of the linear water-wave problem for propagation over a 

uniform sloping beach was first reported by Stokes (1846). These waves propagate along 

the beach (i.e. in the longshore direction) and have an amplitude which decays 

exponentially away from the shoreline (so they provide an example of a trapped wave); a 

sloping beach is essential for their existence. Although such waves may be thought to be 

no more than a mathematical curiosity, they have been found to play an important rôle in 

many processes near the shoreline; see Howd, Bowen & Holman (1992) (and the many 

papers cited therein) for an informative background to this problem. In addition, their

presence often results in an intriguing – and quite delightful – pattern of trochoidal or, 

sometimes, cycloidal waves marking the shoreline; some splendid photographs of these 

run-up patterns can be found in Guza & Inman (1975) and in Komar (1998). 

 

Many authors have made important contributions to the theory of edge waves; we 

mention a few that have been particularly relevant to the current investigation (and each 

contains further references for those who may wish to explore the background more 

deeply). Ursell (1952) demonstrated that more (linear) edge-wave modes appear as the 

(constant) slope of the beach is progressively decreased; an instructive overview of much 

of the classical linear theory is presented in Stoker (1957) (and a slightly more modern 

approach, for simple linear edge waves, is offered in Johnson, 1997). Nonlinear effects in 

the small-amplitude approximation, based on the shallow-water equations, and then on 

the full equations (both for constant beach angles), were described by Whitham (1976); 

this work was extended to more general depth variations by Minzoni (1976). The 

problem of linear edge waves over a gently sloping beach has been addressed by Miles 

(1989), in which a result is obtained (for a uniformly valid approximation for the 

dominant mode) which is generalised here. Mechanisms for the excitation of edge waves 

have been discussed by Minzoni & Whitham (1977) and by Evans (1988, 1989). Some 

quite extensive experimental results are reported in Yeh (1985), which describe the 

evolution and modulation of the edge waves in far more detail than we attempt here. 

However, the main impetus for the work that we present came from another quarter. 

 

In 1966, Yih demonstrated that a coordinate transformation of Gerstner’s 1802 

exact, non-trivial solution of the classical water-wave problem for infinite depth (see 

Lamb, 1932), produces an edge-wave solution for a beach of constant slope. A similar 

observation is given by Mollo-Christensen (1982). These authors provide an implicit 

solution of the problem, but this has recently been improved by Constantin (2001), and 

on two levels. First, he proved that the flow was dynamically possible – the flow map is a 

diffeomorphism – and then he produced a particularly simple parametric representation 

of the run-up pattern on the beach (by using the Lagrangian description of the flow field). 

It was this version of the exact solution which prompted the investigation that we 

describe here. In essence, we will allow the depth to vary on a slow scale (which will be 

the slope at the beach), introduce scalings consistent with the Gerstner-Constantin 

 

2

solution and then develop an asymptotic solution by employing the method of multiple 

scales. By virtue (we might argue) of the existence of the exact solution for a uniform 

slope, it is possible to find an exact solution for variable depth, at leading order, without 

the need to invoke an additional small-amplitude approximation. However, because of 

the particular form of solution that we seek here, we generate a solution which is 

irrotational, whereas the original Gerstner solution, and Constantin’s, describes a solution 

with a non-zero vorticity. (A small-amplitude approximation can always be introduced if 

that might lead to useful additional results.) 

 

On following the formulation of the problem, based on suitable scaled variables 

defined in terms of the small slope (ε) of the beach, the bottom profile is allowed to be a 

general function of the appropriate ‘slow’ variable. The first two terms in the asymptotic 

solution, uniformly valid in space (and time) as ε→ 0 , are obtained and a representation 

of the surface wave is given; in particular, the run-up pattern is described. The properties 

of the solution for various depth profiles are also presented, including the cases of a 

constant depth at infinity or with a sand bar fairly close inshore. We also include, in 

addition to a general depth variation, a longshore current (which varies on the same scale 

as the depth). We confirm that some elements of the solution are described by replacing 

the actual depth profile by an ‘effective’ one, which incorporates the given longshore 

current; this aspect of our new profile agrees with that introduced by Howd, et al. (1992). 

Finally, some model equations with exact solutions, which represent a single mode, are 

offered; these equations may prove worthy of some further investigation, particularly as a 

means for exploring the nature of the interactions between two or more modes.  

2. Governing equations 

We consider an incompressible, inviscid fluid which is bounded above by a free 

surface ( z

= ( ,

h x y t

, ) ) and below by a fixed, impermeable bed ( z

= ( ) , so not a 

b x

function of y). In its undisturbed state, the free surface is z = 0 and this intersects  z

= ( )  
b x

at  x = 0  – the shoreline in the absence of waves; the fluid extends to infinity as  x → ∞  

and otherwise  −∞ < < ∞y

 (where y is the longshore coordinate). This configuration is 

shown in figure 1. We choose to use a typical (or mean) wave length, λ, of the edge

waves as the length scale and  gλ as the speed scale; thus we take λ λg  as the 

appropriate time scale. The pressure (P) is written as 

P P
a=

−

g p
+ρ ρ λ  

gz

 

where ρ is the constant density of the water, g is the constant acceleration of gravity and 

P Pa=

= constant  is the pressure at the free surface. (We ignore the rôle of surface 

tension in this model.) The Euler equation, equation of mass conservation and the 

boundary conditions, written in non-dimensional variables, are then

It will be assumed that suitable initial data exist which will generate the edge waves. We 

use the Euler equation as the basis for this formulation because we make no assumptions, 

ab initio, about the rotationality of the flow field; see Constantin (2001). We will find, in 

the event, that our construction produces a solution which is irrotational. 

The edge waves propagate parallel to the shore (so in the y-direction) and 

otherwise they have a structure in the x-direction; in particular, the wave amplitude 

decays exponentially away from the shoreline. It is likely that the pattern observed at the 

shoreline is generated by standing waves, but we shall follow the conventional route in 

this discussion and analyse only travelling waves. In order to accommodate this 

configuration, and to be consistent with the appearance of the slope of the uniform bed in 

Constantin (2001), we introduce suitable scaled variables. Let ε be the magnitude of the 

slope 

′b ( )0  and, further, we assume that the depth varies slowly on this scale; we define

(We have used subscripts, where convenient, to represent partial derivatives.) These 

equations, (1) – (4), provide the basis for our discussion of the problem, in the limit 

ε→ 0 . Because these equations have been scaled for small slope, they are a version of 

the shallow-water equations. It should be noted, however, that this particular scaling has 

resulted in the nonlinearity being retained at leading order; if a small-amplitude 

approximation is also of interest, then the further scaling

and the problem at each order is formulated. It is expected that uniformity conditions will 

need to be imposed, presumably as  θ → ∞ , and that these will be necessary in order to 

determine completely the earlier terms in the expansions. Furthermore, we observe that 

the velocity component in the z-direction, w, appears at  O( )ε  relative to the other 

components (u, v) in equation (2); it is usual, in shallow-water approximations, to find 

that w is determined at leading order, rather than successively from terms lower down the 

expansion, as is the case here. In addition to the expansion of the dependent variables, we 

also allow

where the term εα1(

function (which, in general, depends on X); there is no advantage – at least, to the order 

we work to here – in also expanding the constant ω.

which is a generalisation of a result obtained by Miles (1989) as a contribution to his 

uniformly valid expansion for the linear, dominant mode for edge waves propagating 

over a small, uniform slope.  The non-uniformity that is evident in (15) and (16), as 

B → 0  for general ω, will be addressed below. 

 

The investigation was continued (in outline) as far as the next terms in the 

expansions, but no additional complications were encountered. A uniformly valid 

solution can be found, although a similar analysis to that described in the Appendix (for 

W0 , U1 , V1  and  p1) is required at this order and, indeed, at every order hereafter. The 

evidence of the first two terms of this type, in conjunction with the general structure of 

this problem, suggests that no non-uniformities arise from these contributions to the 

solution. The solutions appearing at higher order merely produce (small) corrections to 

the solution as presented here, although considerable technical complications are evident 

in the formulation; because of this, we do not record the details.

The vorticity, ω, of this flow field, following the non-dimensionalisation and 

scaling introduced earlier (with ω → εω), can be written

using (14), (15) and (16) (together with the further details given in the Appendix), we 

find that ω = O(

)ε2 , i.e. the flow field is irrotational, correct at  O( )ε . Thus our procedure 

is generating a solution which is an extension of the classical results discussed by Stokes 

(1846) and Whitham (1976), for example, but without invoking a small-amplitude 

approximation. On the other hand, the exact solution for  B X

(

) =

, described by 

Constantin (2001), possesses a non-zero vorticity (which is always in the direction 

perpendicular to the bottom). This exact solution, following our non-dimensionalisation 

and scaling, can be expressed as

which recovers the classical result for the modes of linear edge waves (conventionally 

obtained via the properties of the Laguerre equation). Further, this result also affords a 

measure of agreement with Minzoni (1976) where variable depth (in particular, finite 

depth at infinity) was incorporated within the shallow-water model, yet the eigenvalue 

problem is the same as for the classical constant-slope problem. However, the uniform 

validity of our asymptotic expansion (20) imposes an additional constraint: we require 

that  (

A B0

)

2e θ remains bounded for all X, from the run-up on the beach to infinity. For 

X → 0  (which will apply in the neighbourhood of the run-up), we must have  2

1n >  

(when we elect to use (23)), and so our asymptotic solution is not valid for the lowest 

mode ( n = 0 ), but it does hold for all the others ( n = 1 2,

, ... ).  The exponential decay as X 

(and x)  → +∞  ensures the validity seawards. A discussion of the lowest mode is given in 

section 5, although – as we indicate there – a leading-order, closed-form solution has not 

been found in this case.

(and the correction term, εh1  from (17), could be included if that was thought to be 

useful). For the discussion presented here, we take (24) as the equation that describes the 

run-up pattern at the shoreline, with  A X0(

)  given by (22) (for β= n ) and 

θ

= −

(cid:65)

x . In this equation, (24), because it has been generated by a multiple-

scale technique, we should treat X, θ and ξ each as  O( )1  and independent; however, for 

the purposes of producing graphical results, we must be somewhat cavalier in our 

interpretation. Thus we choose to use a suitable normalised version of this equation:

We suggest, even with µ= O(1) , that this is worth examining as a basis for a 

representation of the run-up pattern. Indeed, because k here is associated with the 

amplitude of the wave (see (22)), some freedom in its choice is permitted (although, 

formally, for k and  (cid:65)  both  O( )1 , we see that µ ε= O(

)n ). It is quite straightforward to 

show that solutions exist of this equation that are continuous, bounded and periodic for 

µ µ≥

>n

0  (for suitable µn , described below). The solutions for µ µ< n  comprise 

closed curves, spaced periodically, which coalesce for µ µ= n  to form two near-cycloids 

that meet at their cusps; for µ µ> n , these curves separate to become a pair of curves that 

correspond to trochoids. These profiles are analogous to the cycloid and trochoid given in 

Constantin (2001), although here we have a pair in each case, and either is an acceptable 

solution – pointing either towards the shore or seawards. (That these two possibilities can 

occur appears to be borne out in some of the observations of edge waves i.e. profiles can 

‘point’ either seawards, or towards the beach; see Guza & Inman, 1975, and Komar,

; an example of a cycloid-like profile ( n = 2 , µ= ⋅5 865) is 

presented in figure 2a (this being one of a pair), and a pair of trochoid-like profiles 

( n = 1, µ= 8 ) is shown in figure 2b. By comparison, the exact solution (Constantin, 

2001) requires, of course, the choice  B X

(

) =

X

 (for  ∀X ) and, in addition, this solution 

corresponds only to the lowest, linear mode (equivalently  n = 0  here); the parameter 

b0

0≤  in Constantin plays the rôle of our µ µ≥ n . Even though we have been cavalier 

with our interpretation of µ, we submit that the model run-up pattern, obtained from 

(25), based on a slowly varying depth, has successfully captured all the essential features 

of this phenomenon, albeit excluding the first mode ( n = 0 ). However, the solutions with 

closed curves (µ µ< n ) cannot be simply interpreted. That they correspond, for example, 

to solutions with ‘holes’ – where the bottom is uncovered – is unlikely because, for 

µ µ≥ n , the ocean extends no further than either one or the other boundary curve i.e. 

never beyond the one furthest inshore. For a hole to appear, the water would need to 

extend beyond this furthest boundary (and so exist indefinitely up the shoreline). We 

suggest, at this stage of the investigation, that solutions for µ µ< n  do not describe a 

physically realistic phenomenon. 

 

These edge waves have the familiar structure of a trapped wave, which is evident 

here by virtue of the exponential decay (terms  emθ,  m = 1 2 3

,

,

, in equations (7) and (14) 

– (17)). In particular, the amplitude function (which predominantly controls the form of 

the surface wave), as a function of x, is

and this allows a detailed investigation of the effects of various depth profiles. This

This expression, (28), has been chosen so that it recovers (27) for λ→ 0  (at fixed Z), 

enabling us directly to compare the results. The amplitude function from the shoreline, 

seawards, for (27) and also some choices of λ in (28), is shown in figure 3 (all for 

n = 2 ). The effect of allowing finite depth at infinity is, not surprisingly, to increase the 

maximum value of the amplitude function. 

 

A more interesting example is provided by the case of a sand bar fairly close 

inshore, in a depth profile that is otherwise linear. Some amplitude profiles, all of which 

correspond to (27) as  Z → 0 , are shown in figure 4. The effect of a sand bar is quite 

dramatic: there is a significant increase in the amplitude just behind (seawards) of the bar 

(as alluded to in Howd, et al., 1992; see also Kirby, Dalrymple & Liu, 1981). Of course, 

any suitable depth profile can be chosen – perhaps a sand bar combined with finite depth 

at infinity – and its effects investigated. 

Finally, we collect these ideas and so present the leading term for the edge waves; 

with the same notation as we used in (25), the surface wave is proportional to

5. The first mode (n = 0)

n = 1, 2, …, thereby excluding the first mode. In the case n = 0, with

without the advantage of an exact solution of our set of equations, we can offer no more 

at this stage; further investigation (perhaps numerical) is deferred for the present.

6. The effects of a longshore current 

Longshore currents are known to play an important rôle in the structure of edge 

waves and, although they are not always present, they do occur often enough to 

encourage further study; see Kenyon (1972) and Howd, et al. (1992). The variation of the 

longshore current in the seawards direction is controlled, to some extent, by the depth 

profile and so we assume in this model that it varies on the same scale as the depth. The 

governing equations are precisely those already presented, in (1) – (4), but with

An additional factor of ω is included here in order to allow direct correspondence with 

our earlier result, (18); we may elect to write the solution in this form because of the 

arbitrary multiplicative constant that is associated with the indefinite integral in the 

exponent. 

It is immediately evident that (30) can be expressed in exactly the same form as 

(18), where the  B X(

)  there is replaced by the ‘effective’ depth profile

see Howd, et al. (1992). We assume that the longshore current satisfies V X(

) <ω (cid:65)  for 

all choices of ω. (If V X(

)  approaches ω (cid:65)  for any particular X, then presumably edge 

waves no longer exist; we do not explore this complication here.) The result of 

combining a typical longshore current of the form

which can incorporate a sand bar; see figure 6. However, although  A0  can be written in 

terms of  B , the rest of the expression for the surface wave, given in (29), requires 

explicit use of V X(

7. Discussion 

The classical water-wave problem, as it applies to the propagation of edge waves, 

has been presented in a form consistent with the recent exact solution given by 

Constantin (2001), but recast for an arbitrary depth profile that varies on a suitable small 

scale (ε). The resulting problem, treated as asymptotic for ε→ 0 , is fully nonlinear at 

leading order, but with a relevant exact solution. This solution has been used to give a 

representation of the run-up pattern at the shoreline, and it would appear that this captures 

most elements of the patterns that are observed (and are seen in the exact solution for a 

uniform slope: Constantin, 2001). However, our closed-form results do not apply to the 

lowest mode (as interpreted by the value of n in the context of the linear problem), 

although it is valid for all the other corresponding modes. We have, therefore, given 

separately a description of the n = 0 problem, with an indication that a solution exists 

16

 

 

 

 

which is consistent with the usual run-up pattern. An additional complication in our 

theory is that the solution for the run-up pattern (

n ≠ ) comprises two families, and there 

0

is no obvious way to select one rather than the other (other than, possibly, by invoking 

the initial data for particular edge waves); this aspect of the problem is still being 

explored. The structure of edge waves, away from the shore, can be described for any 

suitable choice of depth variation. We have included, as examples, the classical uniform-

slope case, constant depth at infinity and a model for a sand bar fairly close inshore. The 

latter two configurations lead to an increase in the maximum amplitude of the edge 

waves, as compared with the corresponding uniform-slope solution. Thus our version of 

the theory of edge waves is offered as a simple way, in the first instance at least, of 

providing an analytical approach in the study of the effects of any chosen depth profile. 

 

The longshore and cross-shore topography which ensures that edge waves can 

exist, given suitable initial conditions, sometimes has an associated longshore current. 

This we have also modelled by allowing the current to vary (seawards) on the same scale 

as the depth profile. The analysis can be carried through, producing a description which 

mirrors, in the main, the earlier results, by replacing the depth profile by an effective 

profile which combines the actual profile with the longshore current. This confirms the 

results obtained by Howd, et al. (1992), although we have been able to provide more 

details (showing, in particular, that the introduction of an effective depth profile is not 

sufficient for the complete description of the wave, to leading order). Again, these 

formulae for the structure of edge waves may be used to give – albeit approximately – a 

simple analytical form of the waves, from the shore to the open ocean. 

 

With the continuing interests in nonlinear equations that are relevant to wave 

phenomena, and which have exact solutions, we conclude by offering two versions of an 

equation that might prove worthy of some further study. If we retain the terms in ε, but 

consider the case of small-amplitude waves (proportional to δ, say; see (5)), then we 

obtain

ε. These two equations, (32) and (33), have exact single-component solutions. We 

suggest that the search for other exact solutions – certainly those that represent the 

interaction of different modes – is a worthy exercise (which might have to be initiated by 

a numerical investigation). If this proves to be unsuccessful, the equations – but 

particularly (32) – can still be used to construct asymptotic solutions for ε→ 0 , because 

this is likely to be simpler than reverting to the original, full equations, and we can see 

 

18

that the equations contain all the essential ingredients for a description of edge waves. 

These and related issues are to be examined in the near future. 

The author is very pleased to acknowledge his thanks to Prof. Adrian Constantin 

for bringing this problem to his attention, and for encouraging an asymptotic approach 

that would complement his analysis. Acknowledgement is also due to the referees whose 

comments led to a number of useful adjustments to an earlier version of this paper.

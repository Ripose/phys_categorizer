Human Dynamics:
The Correspondence Patterns of Darwin and Einstein 

While living in different historical era, Charles Darwin (1809–1882) and Albert Einstein 
(1879–1955)  were  both  prolific  correspondents:  Darwin  sent  (received)  at  least  7,591 
(6,530)  letters  during  his  lifetime  while  Einstein  sent  (received)  over  14,500  (16,200).
Before email scientists were part of an extensive university of letters, the main venue for 
exchanging new ideas and results. But were the communication patterns of the pre-email 
times any different from the current era of instant  access? Here we show that while the 
means  have  changed,  the  communication  dynamics  has  not:  Darwin’s  and  Einstein’s 
pattern of correspondence and today’s electronic exchanges follow the same scaling laws. 
Their  communication  belongs,  however,  to  a  different  universality  class  from  email 
communication,  providing  evidence  for  a  new  class  of  phenomena  capturing  human 
dynamics.

We start from a record containing the sender, recipient and the date of each letter1,2 sent 
or received by the two scientists. As Fig 1a indicates, their correspondence exploded after 
their  raise  to  fame,  and  reached  a  highly  fluctuating  yet  relatively  steady  pattern 
afterwards. While on average they write 0.59 (D) and 1.02 (E) letters per day during the 
last 30 years of their life, these averages hide significant daily fluctuations. For example 
Darwin writes 12 letters on 1874-1-1 and Einstein receives 120 letters on 1949-3-14, for 
his 70th birthday.

The response time,  , represents the time  interval  between the date  of a letter received 
from a given person, and the date of the next letter from Darwin or Einstein to him or her. 
As shown in Fig. 1b and c, the probability that a letter will be replied to in   days is well 
approximated  by a  power  law 
.  The  fact  that  the  scaling spans 
 with
close  to  four  orders  of  magnitude,  from  days  to  years,  indicates  that  the  majority  of 
responses  (53%E,  63%D)  took  less  than  ten  days.  In  some  cases,  however,  the 
correspondence was stalled for months or years. Some of these represent long breaks in 
the  correspondence  and  a  few  are  a  consequence  of  missing  letters.  Others,  however, 
correspond  to  genuine  delays,  like  Einstein’s  Oct  14,  1921  response  to  Ralph  De  Laer 
Kronig’s  letter  of  Sept.  1920,  starting  with  "in  the  course  of  eating  myself  through  a 
mountain of correspondence I find your interesting letter from September of last year."

To understand the origin of the observed scaling behavior we have to realize that given 
the wide range of  response times,  both  Darwin and Einstein  must  have prioritized  their 
correspondence,  responding  to  the  received  letters  based  on  priorities  they  assigned  to 
each. Thus a simple model of their correspondence assumes that letters arrive at a rate 
and  are  responded  to  at  a  rate .  Each  letter  is  assigned  a  priority,  always  the  highest 
priority  letter  being  answered  next.  Therefore,  high  priority  letters  are  responded  soon 
after their arrival, while low priority letters will have to wait considerable time intervals. 
The  waiting  time  distribution  of  this  simple  model3 follows4

that  Einstein  and  Darwin  answer  only  a  fraction  of  letters  they  receive  (their  overall

response  rate  being  0.32  (D)  and  0.24  (E)),  we  have  λ>µ, placing  the  model  in  the 
supercritical  regime,  where  a  finite  fraction  of  letters  are  never  answered.  Numerical 
simulations indicate that in this supercritical regime the waiting time distribution  of the 
responded  letters  also  follows  a  power  law  with  exponent 
,    different  from 
1 obtained for email communications5. Therefore, while the response times in email 
and  mail  communications  follow  the  same  scaling  law,  they  belong  to  different 
universality classes.

The  correspondence  pattern  of  Einstein  and  Darwin,  beyond  representing  examples  of 
well-mapped human interaction patterns, is of major historical interest as well.  The fact 
that they did answer most letters in a timely fashion, indicates that while they had many 
other  responsibilities,  they  were  acutely  aware  of  the  importance  of  this  intellectual 
intercourse.  Yet,  the  occasional  delays  prioritizing  forced  on  them  were  not  always 
without  consequences.  For  example,  on  Oct  14,  1921  Einstein  returns 
to  a 
correspondence  with  Theodor  Kaluza  that  he  left  off  two  years  earlier,  when  he 
discouraged  Kaluza  from  publishing  one  his  papers.  Having  second  thoughts,  he 
recommends the paper’s submission. Encouraged by Einstein’s two years late change of 
mind, Kaluza does so, submitting the now famous paper on five-dimensional unified field 
theory6, a key component of today’s string theory. Would it have made a difference for 
the  course  of  science  if  Einstein  does  not  waver  for  two  years  about  it?  We  will  never
know.  But  our  results  indicate  that  Darwin’s  and  Einstein’s  late  responses  or  resumed 
correspondences  are not  singularities  or  exceptions:  they  are part  of  a  universal  scaling 
law7, representing a fundamental pattern of human dynamics that neither the famous, nor 
the undistinguished can escape.

ABSTRACT 

We  develop  a  coarse-grained  protein  model  with  a  simplified  amino  acid  interaction 

potential.  We  perform  discrete  molecular  dynamics  folding  simulations  of  a  small  20 

residue  protein  –  Trp-cage  –  from  a  fully  extended  conformation.  We  demonstrate  the 

ability  of  the  Trp-cage  model  to  consistently  reach  conformations  within  2Å  backbone 

root-mean-square  distance  (RMSD)  from  the  corresponding  NMR  structures.  The 

minimum RMSD of Trp-cage conformations in the simulation can be smaller than 1.00Å. 

Our  findings  suggest  that,  at  least  for  the  case  of  Trp-cage,  a  detailed  all-atom  protein 

model  with  a  physical  molecular  mechanics  force  field  is  not  necessary  to  reach  the 

native state of a protein. Our results also suggest that the success folding Trp-cage in our 

simulations and in the reported all-atom molecular mechanics simulations studies may be 

mainly due to the special stabilizing features specific to this miniprotein.

Introduction 

In 2001 Neidigh et al. discovered that the 18-residue long segment Leu21-Pro38 

of exendin-4 – a naturally occur 39 amino acid protein – is the smallest known protein-

like folding fragment (1), designated as Trp cage by Barua and Andersen (2). Neidigh et 

al.  (3)  have  truncated  and  redesigned  the  exendin-4  to  a  20-residue  miniprotein  that 

exhibits  cooperative  folding  transition  and  is  significantly  more  stable  than  any  other 
known  miniprotein  (4-8)  (∆GU ≈  8.6  kJ  mol-1  at  3  oC).  Due  to  its  fast  folding  kinetics, 

thermodynamic  stability  and  small  size,  the  Trp  cage  received  a  wide  attention  in 

computational  biophysics  community  (9-14).  These  studies  have  demonstrated  the 

abilities of all-atom molecular mechanics simulations to reach the native state of the Trp 

cage  within  approximately  1Å  backbone  root-mean-square  deviation  (RMSD)  from  a 

completely unfolded conformation. 

A central paradigm of molecular biology is that a protein’s structure is determined 

by  its  amino  acid  sequence.  However,  the  relationship  between  a  protein’s  amino  acid 

sequence  and  its  structure  (protein  folding  problem  (15-21))  remains  largely  unknown 

despite a number of important studies (22-35). While a success in the Trp cage folding in 

computer  simulations  (10-14)  may  be  perceived  as  a  triumph  in  solving  the  protein 

folding problem, we ask here whether the folding dynamics of the Trp cage is governed 

by a just few key factors, not specific to the majority of proteins. If captured by physical 

force-fields employed in molecular mechanics simulations, these factors solely determine 

the dynamics of the Trp cage and, thus, explain the success of studies in Refs. (9-14). 

To  answer  this  question  we  employ  the  discrete  molecular  dynamics  (DMD) 

simulations (36-38). Unlike molecular mechanics simulations driven by physical forces, 

the  DMD  simulations  are  driven  by  collision  events  due  to  ballistic  motion  of  the 

particles  and  constraints  between  these  particles  (39).  Thus,  the  DMD  simulations 

provide us with an important opportunity to test whether just a set of constraints can be 

imposed to capture the key factors governing the Trp cage folding dynamics. 

The evidence for the key factors determining the Trp cage folding dynamics has 

been  suggested  by  Neidigh  et  al.  (1),  who  designed  a  stable  fast  folding  Trp  cage 
sequence  __  NLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS  __  by  mutagenesis  studies  of  a  common 

amino acid sequence pattern for Trp cage fold, XFXXWXXXXGPXXXXPPPX, where 

 

2

X is any amino acid.    These three key factors (i-iii) are listed below. (i) Interactions of 

proline  with  aromatic  residues,  such  as  Pro-Trp,  stabilize  the  Trp  cage.  Gellman  and 

Woolfson  (40)  and  Neidigh  et  al.  (1)  argue  that  several  small  proteins,  such  as  WW 

domains  (41),  villin  headpiece  (42),  Trp  zipper  (43),  and  avian  pancreatic  polypeptide 

(44),  employ  Pro-Trp  stacking  as  a  mean  of  stabilization.  (ii)  The  high  proportion  of 

proline residue  (20%) results in more  rigid Trp cage  structure than  the  majority protein 

structures, drastically reducing the entropy of the Trp cage unfolded state. Gellman and 

Woolfson (45) pointed out that Trp cage is also rich in Gly residues that contrary to Pro 

residues  increase  backbone  flexibility  and,  thus,  favor  unfolded  conformations.  We 

hypothesize  that  Gly  enrichment  is  essential  for  the  Pro-Trp  stacking  to  occur,  and 

despite their destabilization effect on this protein, Gly residues allow this favorable Pro-

Trp  interaction.  (iii)  Pitera  and  Swope  (12)  also  pointed  out  that  a  salt  bridge  between 

Asp9 and Arg16 in the TC5b variant  provides an additional stabilization to the Trp cage. 

We  develop  a  coarse-grained  protein  model,  that  mimics  protein  backbone 

flexibility and side chain packing, and a model of amino acid interactions that are argued 

to be the key factors determining Trp cage folding dynamics (i) – (iii). We demonstrate 

that  our  model  consistently  undergoes  a  folding  transition  from  fully  extended 

conformation to a near-native set of conformations that are within 2.0 Å from the NMR 

structure (3). We show that some states reach the average NMR structure within less than 

1 Å backbone root-mean-square deviation. 

Protein Model 

We  model  protein  by  beads-on-the-string  with  beads  representing  backbone  and 

sidechain  heavy  atoms.  It  has  been  shown  that  a  four-bead  DMD  model  with  three 

backbone  beads  –  N,  Cα,  C’  –  and  one  minimalist  sidechain  bead  Cβ  can  capture  the 

backbone  dynamics  of  the  polypeptides  (36,  46,  47).  It  has  long  been  noticed  that  the 

sidechain entropy makes a critical contribution to the protein folding (48). The four-bead 

model can not be used to estimate the entropy contribution of the sidechains because the 

Cβ bead position is solely determined by the backbone dihedral angles, Φ and Ψ. It has 

also been observed that the packing of different residues in the protein is very important 

in protein folding and design. The Cβ beads in the four-bead model can not fully mimic 

 

 

3

the  different  sizes  for  different  amino  acids.  An  alternative  approach  is  to  position  an 

effective  Cβ  bead  in  the  center  of  mass  for  the  sidechain  atoms.  Since  the  correct 

modeling of backbone dihedral angels requires the van der Waals repulsion between Cβ 

atoms  and  theirs  neighboring  N,  C’,  and  O  atoms,  the  effective  Cβ  model  can  not  fully 

mimic  the  backbone  dynamics  of  polypeptide.  In  order  to  observe  protein  folding,  the 

model  needs  to  correctly  capture  not  only  the  backbone  entropy  but  also  the  sidechain 

entropy  and  the  size  effect  for  the  packing  of  sidechains.  Therefore,  to  keep  the  model 

simple while effectively capture all the important features, we add one or two additional 

effective  sidechain  atoms  into  the  four-bead  model  (36,  46,  47).  For  the  β-branched 

amino  acids  –  Thr,  Ile  and  Val  –  we  introduce  two  gamma  beads  representing  the  two 

branches after Cβ. For bulky amino acids – Arg, Lys and Trp – we include an additional 

Cδ bead.  In Figure 1 we present the schematic diagram of the model protein.  

To model hydrogen bonding more accurately, we add the oxygen atoms into the 

backbone of the original four-bead model (36). For the amino acids that are neither beta-

branched nor bulky, the gamma beads are positioned at in the geometrical center of the 

group of all heavy atoms of the sidechain except Cβ (see Figure 1). The two effective Cγ 

beads  of  the  β-branched  amino  acids  are  centered  in  the  geometrical  center  of  the  two 

groups of heavy atoms forming the branches. For Lys and Arg, the effective Cγ beads are 

located in the position of the actual Cδ atom. The effective Cδ bead of Lys is located in 

position of the charged Nζ atom. Similarly, the effective Cδ bead of Arg plays the role of 

the positive charge center and coincides with the actual Cζ atom. For Trp, the effective Cγ 

bead  is  centered  in  the  five-atom  ring  and  the  effective  Cδ  bead  is  centered  in  the  six-

atom benzene ring. We assigned the mass of each bead according to the total mass of the 

group of atoms it represents.  

 In  order  to  model  the  bond  lengths  and  bond  angles,  we  introduce  constraints 

between  the  nearest  and  next  nearest  neighboring  beads  (38).  The  parameters  are 

presented in the Table 1. Due to introduction of the gamma and delta beads in the model, 

we  are  able  to  model  the  sidechain  dihedral  angles.  For  proline,  we  also  model  the 

unusual  properties  of  the  backbone  and  side-chain  dihedral  angels  by  mimicking  the 

covalent  bond  between  the  sidechain  and  the  backbone.  We  describe  in  the  Methods 

 

4

section  the  details  of  the  modeling  of  the  sidechain  dihedral  angles  as  well  as  the 

treatment of the special residue, proline. 

Non-bonded  Interactions:  We  model  amino-acid  interactions  by  assigning 

square well potentials between pairs of the non-bonded beads (the pairs without bonded 

constraints). Each bead is modeled as an interacting soft ball with a hardcore radius (HC) 

and its interaction range (IR), which are assigned according to statistical analysis of the 

contacts made between residues (see Methods). We include in our model the hydrophobic 

interaction HHP, salt bridge interaction HSB, aromatic interaction between aromatic amino 

acids  HAR,  aromatic-proline  interaction  between  proline  and  aromatic  residues  HAR-PRO, 

hydrogen  bond  interaction  among  main-chains

Here,  hydrophobic,  salt-bridge,  aromatic,  and  aromatic-proline  interactions  are  solely 

between  the  effective  sidechain  beads  of  different  residues:  the  beta,  gamma,  and  delta 

beads. The non-bonded beads of the same residue interact with each other by hard-core 

repulsion. In order to assign various types of interactions for all pairs of sidechain beads, 

we categorize all the sidechain beads into six following types (Table 3): hydrophobic (H), 

amphipathic  (A),  aromatic  (AR),  neutral  polar  (P),  positively  charged  (PC),  and 

negatively  charged  (NC).  One  bead  can  have  more  than  one  types,  for  example,  the 

gamma bead of phenylalanine is both hydrophobic and aromatic (see Table 3).  

Only pairwise interactions between sidechain beads are considered in the present 

model and the potential functions are stepwise:

where i and j denote different sidechain beads, the HC is the hardcore radius of each bead 

and  the  IR  is  the  interaction  range  for  each  bead  (Table  1).  The  parameter  IRext  is 

introduced to allow an attraction before the two beads come to their interaction ranges. In 

 

 

5

our  study,  we  set  IRext  as  0.75Å.  Hydrophobic  interactions  are  assigned  between  two 

hydrophobic beads or between one hydrophobic and another amphipathic beads if both of 

the two beads are not aromatic and/or proline. The interaction strengths are assigned as 

εHH and εHA, respectively. The aromatic interactions are assigned between two aromatic 

beads – namely the Cγ of Phe and Tyr, and the Cδ of Trp – with the strength of εAR. The 

aromatic-proline interaction is assigned between the Cγ bead of proline and the aromatic 

bead.  The  interaction  strength  is  εAR-PRO.  The  salt-bridge  interactions  are  assigned 

between the positively charged bead and the negatively charged beads with the strength 

εSB. Two beads of the same charge experience the hardcore repulsion.  

The hydrogen bond interactions are introduced among the backbones and between 

the backbone and polar sidechain beads using an algorithm similar to Ref. (36) (see the 

Methods  section  for  details).  The  strengths  of  these  interactions  are  MM

HBε  and 

SM
HBε , 

respectively.  

In  summary,  our  model  has  seven  interaction  parameters: εHH, εHA, εAR, εAR-PRO, 

εSB,  MM

HBε , 

SM

HBε ,  and  εχ,  where  εχ  is  the  interaction  strength  used  to  model  the  dihedral 

angles (Methods). To fold Trp cage, we have assigned the initial values to the parameters 

according  to  available  literature  (49)  and  adjust  these  values  using  feedback  from  our 

folding simulations. In the presented study, we set the parameters of the bonded and non-

bonded  interaction  strengths  εχ=1.5ε,  εHH=1.05ε,  εHA  =0.60ε,  εAR=1.80ε, εAR-PRO=1.50ε, 

εSB=2.70ε,  MM

HBε =5.00ε, and 

HBε  =2.50ε, where the energy unit, ε, is of the order of 1kcal 
mol-1.  Starting  from  fully  extended  polymers,  we  perform  molecular  dynamics 

SM

simulations  at  various  temperatures.  The  temperature  unit  is  related  to  the  energy  unit, 

ε/kB. The temperature is controlled by Berendsen thermostat (50) with the heat exchange 

rate equal to 0.1 per time unit. The time unit is the derivative of the units of length, mass 

and energy, which are defined as Å, atomic mass of carbon mC, and ε, respectively. 

Results and discussions 

In  order  to  study  the  folding  process  of  Trp  cage,  we  perform  equilibrium 

molecular  dynamics  simulations  of  a  coarse-grained  model  miniprotein  at  various 

temperatures (see Methods) starting from an extend conformation. Throughout this study, 

 

 

6

the  temperature  is  measured  in  units  of  energy  ε,  divided  by  Boltzmann  constant,  ε/kB 

(see Methods).  The calculation of RMSD is based on the positions of the backbone Cα 

atoms  and  the  native  state  is  chosen  as  the  first  NMR  model  of  Trp  cage  (Protein 

DataBank  (51)  code:  1L2Y).  At  very  high  temperatures,  i.e.  T=1.00,  the  protein  is 

completely  unfolded  and  remains  in  the  random  coil  state  with  the  average  radius  of 

gyration (Rg) of approximately 12 Å. As we decrease the temperature below T=0.80, the 

protein collapses to a compact conformation similarly to the coil-globular transition (52), 

which is a non-cooperative process and is manifested as the shoulder in the specific heat 

plot in Figure 2a. 

Within  the  temperature  range  0.70<T<0.80  the  protein  remains  mostly  in  the 

globular state and remains unfolded during most of the simulation time. In Figure 2b, we 

present  a  typical  simulation  trajectories  at  temperature  T=0.72.  The  average  radii  of 

gyration  of  the  native,  random  coil,  and  fully  extended  states  of  Trp  cage  are 

approximately 7Å, 12 Å, and 19Å, respectively. The average Rg of the unfolded states at 

T=0.72  is  approximately  9.5Å.  Thus,  the  unfolded  states  in  the  simulation  are 

significantly  collapsed  and  the  extent  of  reduction  of  Rg  upon  folding  from  these 

collapsed states is only ≈30%. We also observe that the RMSD of these unfolded states 

from the native state is on average 4.3Å. Rapid fluctuations in the RMSD suggest that the 

model  protein  is  mostly  present  in  the  unfolded  state  without  populating  any  specific 

stable state. According to the studies of Reva et al. (53), the RMSD distribution for a 20-

residue  protein  with  randomly  selected/constructed  globular  protein-like  structures  is 

Gaussian  with  the  average  of  9Å  and  the  standard  deviation  of  2Å.  Therefore,  the 
probability to find a globular structure with RMSD less than 4Å is 10-4.  Thus, the model 

protein remains in a highly collapsed state with a non-trivial similarity to the native-state, 

a so-called “molten globular” state (54).  

Another  important  observation  during  our  high  temperature  simulations  is  that 

fluctuations  can  approach  the  folded  state  with  RMSD  as  low  as  2Å  (Figure  2b), 

indicating  the  availability  of  the  native  state  even  at  these  relatively  high  temperatures. 

The  native  state  is  not  stable  at  these  temperatures  and  the  protein  rapidly  unfolds  to  a 

denatured  molten  globular  state  because  the  potential  energy  loss  due  to  thermal 

fluctuation is not sufficient to overcome the gain in the entropic contribution to the free 

 

7

energy  which  is  the  product  of  the  temperature  and  the  entropy  loss  upon  folding.  By 

decreasing  the  temperature,  we  expect  to  observe  more  folded  species,  defined  as  the 

structures with RMSD less than 2Å. 

At  an  intermediate  temperature  T=0.63,  we  observe  the  model  protein  in  the 

folded state with a significantly high probability (Figure 2c). Once the protein reaches the 
folded  state,  it  remains  in  the  folded  state  for  a  long  simulation  time  –  longer  than  104 

time  units  –  and  then  unfolds.  Approximately  equal  probability  of  the  folded  and  the 

unfolded  (molten  globular)  states  (Figure  2f)  and  multiple  folding/unfolding  transitions 

along  the  simulation  trajectory  (Figure  2c)  indicates  the  proximity  of  the  simulation 

temperature to the folding transition temperature of Trp cage. To demonstrate the initial 

folding  from  the  initial  stretched-chain  conformation,  we  present  in  Figure  2d  the 
trajectory of the initial 104 time units. The initial collapse from the stretched chain is very 

rapid  and  occurs  within  1000  time  units  as  the  value  of  Rg  approaches  10Å  while  the 
RMSD  is  still  4Å.  After  approximately  104  time  units,  this  molten  globular  state 

rearranges itself and reaches the folded state with RMSD less than 2Å. In Figure 2e, we 

present a trajectory for the simulation at low temperature T=0.57. At this temperature, the 

probability  to  observe  the  folded  state  is  much  larger  than  that  to  observe  an  unfolded 

state.  At  low  temperatures  (T<TF),  the  folding  dynamics  becomes  slow  and  the  protein 
model free energy landscape develops kinetic traps upon folding (the first 105 time unit 

trajectories in Figure 2e). Once the protein folds, it is stable in the folded state with some 

infrequent  and  short-lived  unfolding  fluctuations.  In  approximately  one  out  of  ten 

simulations  at  low  temperatures,  we  observe  the  kinetic  trapping  which  may  expand  to 
almost the entire simulation of 5x105 time units (data not shown). However, the potential 

energy of the traps is always larger than that for the folded state as in Figure 2e.  

In Figure 2d, we present the distribution of RMSD for various temperatures. As 

temperature decreases, the population of folded states increases, so the folding transition 

temperature  can  be  identified  to  be  approximately  TF=0.63.  At  this  temperature,  the 

distribution  is  bimodal  with  two  peaks  of  equal  area  with  maxima  at  1.7Å  and  3.5Å 

corresponding to folded and unfolded states respectively. 

As  shown  in  Figure  2,  our  simplified  model  can  reproducibly  reach  the  folded 

state with an average RMSD of less than 2Å and can reach structures with RMSD smaller 

 

8

as  1.0Å  in  the  wide  range  of  temperatures.  To  characterize  the  structure  of  the  folded 

state obtained in DMD simulations, we show in Figure 3a,b a typical DMD configuration 

with  RMSD of 0.96Å from two opposite view points. In these figures, we show coarse-

grained representation of the side-chains for different residues. In agreement with NMR 

structures, the trademark residue of Trp cage Trp6 is closely packed with residues Tyr3, 

Pro12, Pro18, Pro19, forming the core. We also observe the formation of the salt-bridge 

between  the  Asp9  and  Arg16.  The  two  helices,  α-helix1-8  and  310  helix  around  Ser13, 

coincide with those in the NMR structures. Keeping in mind that our model includes only 

a set of key interaction and has coarse-grained backbone and side-chain representations 

with  simplified  step-wise  interaction  potential  functions,  the  proximity  of  the  DMD 

folded state to the experimental native state is not guaranteed a priori. 

One  important  question  of  a  protein  model  with  a  set  of  amino  acid  interaction 

parameters is whether the potential energy of the native state corresponds to the ground 

state,  i.e.  the  lowest  energy  state  of  all  available  structures.  In  order  to  address  this 

question for our model with the given simple interaction parameters, we present in Figure 

3c,d,e the contour plots of the number of states observed in a simulation trajectory with a 

given  potential  energy  and  RMSD  at  different  temperatures.  In  general,  we  observe  a 

significant  correlation  between 

the  potential  energy  and  RMSD  for  different 

temperatures. However, even below folding transition temperature, we still observe some 

outliers:  structures  with  small  RMSD  but  large  potential  energies,  and  structures  with 

large  RMSD  (≈4.0Å)  whose  potential  energy  is  close  to  that  of  the  folded  states. 
Nevertheless,  the  probability  to  observe  these  outliers  is  very  low,  of  the  order  of  10-5 

(Figure 3c,d,e). Therefore, the entropy of those states is small and thus the corresponding 

free-energy  is  higher  than  that  of  the  folded  states  with  low  RMSD  and  low  potential 

energy. A similar problem of the existence of the outliers has also been observed in the 

all-atom molecular mechanics studies (9, 13, 55).  

The  simplified  model  combined  with  fast  dynamics  algorithm  gives  us  the 

opportunity to study the folding process in many successful folding events starting from 

the  extended  chain.  We  find  that  the  time  needed  for  folding  and  also  the  detailed 

pathways  of  folding  are  extremely  heterogeneous  for  different  trajectories  at  different 

temperatures.  However,  an  initial  collapse  is  common  to  all  of  these  folding  processes. 

 

9

For the Trp cage, the initial collapse is mainly due to the aromatic and aromatic-proline 

interactions.  These  collapsed  structures  are  non-specific,  i.e.,  have  no  well-defined 

structural features. We present in Figure 4a,b two different collapsed structures where the 

aromatic  and/or  aromatic-proline  contacts  are  present.  Although  the  salt-bridge 

interaction  is  assigned  to  be  the  strongest  term  in  the  side  chain  interactions,  the  salt-

bridge  between  Asp9  and  Arg16  is  not  necessarily  present  in  the  collapsed  states.  To 

better  understand  the  ensemble  property  of  the  collapsed  states,  we  calculate  the 

frequency map (Figure 4e) from the trajectories at T=0.72. At this temperature the protein 

is  mainly  present  in  the  molten  globular  states  which  are  flexible  and  can  unfold  into 

completely extended states (see Figure 2b,f). A contact between two residues is defined 

to exist when any of the interacting side-chain beads are within their interaction ranges. 

In the frequency map of the collapsed state of Figure 4e, the formation of the short range 

hydrophobic  contacts  near  the  N-terminus  have  high  probability.  The  probability  to 

observe  the  salt-bridge  between  Asp9  and  Arg16  is  only  ≈0.2.  The  long-range  contacts 

between  the  poly-proline17-19  and  the  Trp6  and  Tyr3  have  also  low  probability  due  to 

the  non-specific  nature  of  the  collapse  state  (the  contacts  within  the  elliptical  circles  in 

Figure 4e). 

In order to fold from the collapsed molten globular states into its native state, the 

protein  has  to  develop  the  native  secondary  structure.  It  is  interesting  to  quantify  the 

propensity  of  different  secondary  structures  in  these  collapsed  states.  Following  the 

method proposed by Rose et al. (56), we calculate the propensity of different secondary 

structures at T=0.72 where the protein remains mostly in the molten globular state (Figure 

2f). Since the calculation of secondary structure propensity in Ref. (57) is based only on 

the  backbone  dihedral  angles,  the  propensity  of  strand  formation  actually  measures  the 

propensity to be in extended conformations. The dominant secondary structure is random 

coil-like  except  that  the  polyproline17-19  is  extended.  Interestingly,  the  probability  to 

observe  helixes  for  residues  2-9  is  significant,  ≈10%,  indicating  a  strong  helical 

propensity for first half residues of the Trp cage even in the molten globular state.  

It  is  of  great  interest  to  study  the  folding  mechanism  from  many  successful 

folding  transitions  observed  in  our  simulations.  However,  our  simulations  are  done  in 

vacuum, in absence of water. The lack of diffusive friction due to absence of surrounding 

 

10

water might lead to artifacts in folding dynamics in the event sequences and time scales 

of  formation  of  different  secondary  and  tertiary  structures.  We  argue  that  although  the 

population of different folding pathways might be different with and without the explicit 

solvent,  the  analysis  of  multiple  folding  transitions  in  the  absence  of  solvent  might 

provide us the information of the possible pathways.  

According  to  our  simulations,  the  protein  in  the  collapsed  molten  globular  state 

must form all the secondary structures including the α-helix, 310-helix as well as the salt-

bridge  which  are  present  in  the  native  fold.  This  rearrangement  process  is  highly 

heterogeneous. Typically the formation of the fist α-helix is faster than the formation of 

310-helix. The preformed salt-bridge behaves as a trap for the formation of the 310-helix 

and needs to break in order for the short helix to form. We also observe in some folding 

processes a folding pathway similar to what is described in Ref. (13): the pre-formed salt-

bridge  between  Asp9  and  Arg16  separates  two  pre-packed  sub-cores  of  Try3,  Trp6, 

Pro12  and  the  poly-proline17-19  (Figure  4c);  the  preformed  salt-bridge  must  break  in 

order for the global folding to occur (Figure 4d).  

 

Conclusions 

We  reproduce  folding  of  the  miniprotein,  a  20-residue  long  Trp  cage,  using  a 

simplified protein model. Introducing only key interactions that stabilized the Trp cage, 

namely the aromatic-proline, salt-bridge, and the hydrogen bond interaction, our coarse-

grained model of the mini-protein is able to fold into the native state with average RMSD 

less than 2Å, while some conformations reach the NMR structure with RMSD less than 

1.00Å.  Several  all-atom  molecular  dynamics  studies  for  the  Trp  cage  were  reported  to 

fold  into  structures  with  similar  backbone  RMSD  (10-14).  In  our  DMD  model,  the 

protein is simplified into a string of inter-connected beads which are interacting with each 

other  via  square-well  types  of  interaction  potentials.  Therefore,  our  success  to 

reproductively fold Trp cage into its NMR native state suggests that an atomic detailed 

protein  model  with  sophisticate  force  fields  is  not  necessary  to  fold  a  protein  into  its 

native state, at least in the case of Trp cage.  

In  addition,  we  find  that  once  the  key  stabilizing  interactions  –  the  aromatic-
proline,  salt-bridge,  and  the  hydrogen  bond  interaction  – are  emphasized,  the  resulting 

 

11

folding  is  not  very  sensitive  to  actually  assigned  values  of  the  parameters  (data  not 

shown). This persistent ability of our Trp cage model to fold under the emphasis of the 

important interactions is due to the special sequence and structural properties specific to 

Trp  cage.  For  instance,  the  inclusion  of  a  high  level  of  prolines  reduces  the  available 

conformation  space,  as  well  as  increases  number  the  aromatic-proline  contacts.  The 

aromatic-proline  interaction  is  commonly  observed  to  stabilize  the  protein-protein  and 

protein-ligand interactions (58). This might also be one of the reasons for the success of 

different  all-atom  molecular  mechanics  studies  of  Trp  cage  using  different  force  fields 

(10-14). Therefore, we conclude that it might be too early to draw the conclusion about 

the “correctness” of the modern molecular mechanics force fields from the recent success 

in the all-atom molecular dynamics folding studies of Trp cage and that additional tests 

on a large set of proteins are necessary. 

An  important  advantage  of  the  coarse-grained  model  with  simplified  interaction 

potential  is  the  ability  to  reach  an  effective  time  scale  of  the  simulation  trajectories 

several orders of magnitude longer than the traditional all-atom molecular dynamics.  We 

show in this study that our model of the mini-protein is able to undergo multiple folding 

and unfolding transitions in a single simulation trajectory which is yet to be observed in 

all-atom molecular mechanics simulations. 

In  our  simulations,  we  observe  a  significant  correlation  between  the  potential 

energy  and  RMSD,  i.e.  small  RMSD  states  usually  correspond  to  low  potential  energy 

states.  However,  we  still  observe  some  outliers  or  decoy  states  that  have  low  potential 

energy but high RMSD. It is possible to train the parameters of the model, which, in our 

simplified case, include only seven interaction variables, to better satisfy the ground-state 

criteria by trying various potential-training methods such as minimizing the Z-score (59) 

or  perceptron  learning  (60,  61).  More  detailed  potential  energy  functions  of  side-chain 

interactions  may  also  improve  the  proximity  of  the  folded  state  of  the  model  to  the 

experimental  native  state.  However,  these  methods  applied  to  a  single  protein  do  not 

guarantee  the  transferability  to  other  proteins  (62).  In  order  to  improve  the  predictive 

power  of  the  current  model,  one  has  to  design  transferable  potential  energy  functions 

using multiple proteins.

Methods 

Discrete  molecular  dynamics:  The  discrete  molecular  dynamics  algorithm 

(DMD)  is  based  on  pairwise  spherically  symmetrical  potentials  that  are  discontinuous 

functions  of  an  interatomic  distance  (38,  63-65).  The  earliest  molecular  dynamics 

simulations  (64)  were  performed  with  the  discrete  algorithm,  before  the  advent  of 

continuous potentials and thus the modern molecular mechanics. In DMD all atoms move 

with  constant  velocity  unless  their  come  to  distances  where  the  stepwise  potential 

function  changes.  At  this  moment  of  time  their  velocities  change  instantaneously.  This 

change  satisfies  the  laws  of  energy,  momentum,  and  angular  momentum  conservations. 

When  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  particles  is  not  sufficient  to  overcome  the  potential 

barrier, the atoms undergo a hard core reflection with no potential energy change. At each 

collision time, only the positions and velocities of the two atoms involved in the collision 

are updated. 

 Sidechain  dihedral  angles:  Since  the  model  contains  up  to  three  effective 

sidechain beads for the amino acids, we are able to model the sidechain dihedral angles χ1 

and χ2. It is well known that the rotamers have limited freedom of rotation. We model the 

behavior of rotamers by introducing effective bonds between the C’ and the effective γ1 

bead for χ1 and between Cα and the effective δ bead for χ2, with the following potential,

where  dmin  <  d0  <  d1  <  d2  <  dmax  (Figure  5a,b).    As  it  is  demonstrated  in  the  schematic 

diagram of Figure 5a, the values of d0 and d1 and d2 determine the distribution of correct 

rotamer angles. We calculate the distributions of distances between the effective gamma 

bead  and  backbone  C’  for  different  amino  acids  by  sampling  over  thousands  of  crystal 

structures  from  PDB.  For  instance,  we  present  in  Figure  5c  the  distribution  for  valine. 

The  parameters  related  to  the  constraints  for  different  residues  are  listed  in  Table  2.  In 

Figure 5d, we show the distribution of the χ1 angles for an unfolded poly-valine peptide 

from DMD simulations. In our model, the gamma and/or delta beads are coarse-grained 

atoms and if the gamma and/or delta beads for a certain amino acid are very flexible the 

corresponding χ1 and χ2 angles have no well defined values in the frame of current model. 

 

13

Therefore, in this model we do not assign any constraints to confine the rotamer angles 

for the amino acids with flexible effective gamma and/or delta beads: Arg, Glu, Gln, Lys, 

and  Met.  Trp  residue  contains  a  well-defined  Cδ  bead  and  we  introduce  a  similar 

constraint between the Cα and the Cδ bead to model χ2 (see Table 2).  

 

Proline:  Proline  is  a  special  imino  acid  because  its  sidechain  is  linked  by  a 

covalent bond with its backbone amide. Therefore, its distribution of the χ1 angle differs 

from  such  distributions  for  other  amino  acids.  We  assign  for  proline  a  covalent  bond 

between gamma bead and its backbone nitrogen bead with an average distance as 1.80Å 

and  the  allowed  fluctuations  of  ±0.09Å.  Covalently  connected  to  its  backbone,  proline 

also has unusual Ф angle distributions (Figure 5e). We introduce a constraint between the 

prime carbon of previous residue and the beta carbon of proline residue with the distance 

of 3.63±0.05Å. In Figure 5f, we present the distribution of the dihedral angles of proline 

from  a  DMD  simulation  of  poly-proline.  The  experimental  and  simulated  distributions 

are in agreement with each other. 

Assignment  of  the  hardcore  radii  and  interaction  range: We model the non-

bonded interactions by assigning stepwise potentials between pairs. Each bead is modeled 

as an interacting soft ball with a hardcore radius and its interaction range. To assess the 

hardcore  radii  and  interaction  ranges  for  various  sidechain  beads,  we  make  statistical 

evaluation of the available crystal structures from PDB. First, we define the existence of a 

contact between two effective sidechain beads, if any two atoms from the two groups of 

actual  sidechain  heavy  atoms  which  the  two  effective  beads  represent  are  within  4.5Å 

from  each  other.  Next,  we  calculate  the  distributions  of  distances  between  the  two 

effective  sidechain  beads  that  are  in  contact.  From  this  distribution,  we  estimate  the 

corresponding hardcore radius, HC, and the interaction range, IR, which are also listed in 

Table 1.  

Mainchain hydrogen bond interactions: The algorithm to model hydrogen bond 

interaction  among  mainchain  of  the  protein  model  in  discrete  molecular  dynamics 

simulations is similar to that in Ref. (36). The difference between the previous model and 

the  current  model  is  that  we  introduce  the  backbone  oxygen  bead.  The  hydrogen  bond 

interaction is now between the backbone hydrogen bond donor (HBD), nitrogen Ni, and 

hydrogen  bond  acceptor  (HBA),  carbonyl  oxygen  Oj.  In  order  to  mimic  the  angular 

 

14

dependence of the backbone hydrogen bond, we introduce three auxiliary constraints: Ni – 

Cj, Cαi – Oj, and Ci-1 – Oj, which are presented in Figure 6a as the thin dashed lines. In 

order to assess the interaction ranges for a hydrogen bond, we calculate the four distances 

for  actual  hydrogen  bonds  by  sampling  over  thousands  of  native  structures  from  PDB. 

We define a hydrogen bond in the native structures from PDB by the following criteria: 

(a)  the  distance  of  oxygen  and  hydrogen  are  within  2.5Å,  (b)  the  angles  of  NiHiOj  and 
CiOiHj are larger than 90o. The histograms of the four distances are presented in Figure 

6b.  The  distributions  of  all  the  distances  are  Gaussian-like.  Therefore,  we  define  the 

minimum and maximum interaction distances,  HBd min  and  HBd max , for each of the related pairs 

according to their average values and variances (listed in Table 4). 

When any one of the four pairs, Ni – Oj, Ni – Cj. Cαi – Oj, or Ci-1 – Oj, comes to 

their corresponding  HBd max  distance, the program checks if the rest three pairs whether their 

HBd min  and  HBd max  distances. If all the distances are within their constraints, a hydrogen bond 

is formed and the potential energy loss is  MM

HBε . The corresponding oxygen and nitrogen 

change their types into their hydrogen bonded types, Ni’ and Oj’. Once they change their 

types,  they  can  not  form  any  other  hydrogen  bond  unless  the  existing  hydrogen  bond 

breaks. The way for the dissociation of the hydrogen bond is similar. Once any one of the 

four pairs comes to the distance of  HBd max  and the kinetic energy is enough to overcome the 

loss  of  kinetics  energy  MM

HBε ,  the  hydrogen  bond  breaks  and  the  nitrogen  and  oxygen 

return to their original types which are able to form hydrogen bonds again. 

Sidechain and mainchain hydrogen bond interactions: It has also been pointed 

out  (66-68)  that  the  hydrogen  bonds  between  the  polar  sidechain  and  main-chains  are 

important for the starting and ending of α-helices and also for the formation of turns in 

proteins.  We  introduce  this  type  of  hydrogen  bond  interactions  in  our  model  for  those 

polar  residues,  namely  Thr,  Ser,  Asn,  Asp,  Gln,  and  Glu,  which  are  observed  to 

frequently  form  this  type  of  hydrogen  bonds  in  the  PDB  structures  (69).  There  are  two 

types of possible hydrogen bonding interactions between sidechain and main-chains:  

(i)  Sidechain  beads  as  hydrogen  bond  donor.  We  allow  the  polar  sidechain 

gamma  beads  of  Asn,  Asp,  Gln,  Glu,  Ser,  and  Thr  to  form  hydrogen  bonds  with  the 

backbone  nitrogen.  In  order  to  mimic  the  angular  dependence  of  hydrogen  bond,  we 

 

15

introduce additional constraints between the gamma bead and the two neighboring beads 

of  the  corresponding  nitrogen  beads  –  prime  carbon  and  alpha  carbon  –  along  the 

backbone.  Since  the  gamma  beads  are  coarse-grained,  we  do  not  introduce  any 

constraints  between  the  backbone  nitrogen  beads  and  the  neighboring  beads  of  the 

effective gamma beads.  

(ii)  Sidechain  beads  as  hydrogen  bond  acceptor.  We  also  allow  the  polar 

sidechain  gamma  beads  of  Ser,  Thr,  Asn,  and  Gln  to  form  hydrogen  bonds  with  the 

backbone carbonyl oxygen. The auxiliary constraints are between the neighboring prime 

carbon and the sidechain gamma beads. Sidechain gamma beads of Asn, Gln, Ser and Thr 

can be either HBD or HBA. For simplicity, we only allow one type of hydrogen bond to 

be  formed  at  one  time.  The  parameters  for  the  sidechain  and  backbone  interactions  are 

assigned by analyzing the corresponding hydrogen bonds in the PDB structures and are 

listed in Table 4. 

Once  a  sidechain  gamma  bead  meets  a  free  backbone  nitrogen  or  oxygen  at  the 

hydrogen  bonding  range HBd max ,  we  check  the  distances  of  the  corresponding  constraints 

between the gamma beads and the neighboring beads of nitrogen or oxygen: Cα and C’ 

beads  near  the  nitrogen  or  C’  bead  near  oxygen.  If  all  the  constraints  are  satisfied, 

potential energy is decreased by 

HBε  and a temporary bond is assigned for the auxiliary 

SM

pairs so that the orientation is satisfied during the life-time of hydrogen bond. Both the 

backbone nitrogen/oxygen and the gamma bead change their types upon the formation of 

hydrogen  bond.  Once  the  hydrogen-bonded  gamma  beads  and  its  corresponding 

backbone  hydrogen  partner,  backbone  nitrogen  or  oxygen,  come  to  the  distance 

HBd max  

again, the dissociation might happen. If the kinetic energy is enough to overcome the gain 

of  potential  energy,  the  hydrogen  bond  beaks.  Upon  the  dissociation  of  the  hydrogen 

bonds, the involved beads change their types back to their original types. 

 Please  note  the  difference  in  the  treatment  of  the  two  types  of  hydrogen  bonds 

which  we  introduce  in  order  to  simplify  the  algorithm.  A  hydrogen  bond  between  two 

backbone  beads  may  form  or  dissociate  if  the  oxygen-nitrogen  distance  or  any  other 

distance  of  the  three  auxiliary  interactions  becomes  equal  to  its  maximal  value HBd max .  In 

contrast, a hydrogen bond between a side-chain bead and a backbone bead may form or 

 

16

dissociate  only  if  the  donor-acceptor  distance  becomes  equal  to HBd max .  In  this  type  of 

hydrogen bonds, the auxiliary bonds act as permanent bonds with infinitely high potential 

wells and can form or break only simultaneously with the donor-acceptor bond.

Figure  1:  The  schematic  diagram  of  the  model  peptide.  Only  two  consecutive  residues 

are presented. The shaded second gamma and delta beads – Cγ2 and Cδ – indicate that not 

all  amino  acids  have  them.  Covalent  bonds  are  represented  as  thick  lines  and  the 

constraints that need to fix the bonds angles and the planar property of peptide bonds are 

denoted as thin dashed lines.

Figure  2:  The  folding  thermodynamics  of  Trp  cage.  (A)  The  specific  heat  Cv  as  the 

function  of  temperature.  The  potential  energy  (P.E),  radius  of  gyration  (Rg)  and  the  Cα 

RMSD  are  plotted  as  the  functions  of  simulation  time  for  different  temperatures:  (B) 

T=0.72,  (C)  T=0.63  and  (E)  T=0.57.  To  show  the  initial  collapsing  and  folding,  we 
present  in  (D)  the  folding  trajectories  of  the  initial  104  time  units  at  T=0.63.  (F)  The 

distributions of the RMSD at different temperatures.

Figure 3: The snapshot of one of folded ensemble from DMD simulation is shown in two 

opposite views (A) and (B). The simulation structure is aligned with respect to the NMR 

structure which is shown in cartoon representation. The native structure is colored purple 

and  the  MD  structure  is  in  cyan.  In  the  structure  from  MD  simulations,  residues  Trp6, 

Tyr3 and Pro12, 17, 18, and19 are shown in space-filled representation and are colored as 

golden. We also shown the salt-bridge formed between Asp9 and Arg16 which are drawn 

as meshed spheres. Since our model is coarse-grained, only the reduced side-chain beads 

are shown.  The scatter plot of RMSD vs. the potential energy for various temperatures: 

(C) T=0.72; (D) T=0.63; and (E) T=0.57.

Figure 5: The schematic diagram for the χ1 constraint. (A) The distance between Cγ and 

C’ beads is drawn as the function of rotamer angle χ1. The shaded regions correspond to 

the allowed rotamer angle regions around π/3, π, and 5π/3. (B) The introduced potential 

between  the  Cγ  and  C’  beads.  (C)  The  probability  distribution  of  the  distance,  dcc’  for 

valine,  which  is  calculated  from  available  PDB  structures.  (D)  The  probability  of  χ1 

angles  from  DMD  simulation  of  unfolded  poly-valine.  (E)  The  Ramachandran  plot  of 

proline from (a) various crystal structures from PDB, and from (F) the DMD simulations 

of a poly-proline peptide.

Figure  6: (A) The schematic diagram of the hydrogen bond among backbone. Only the 

backbone  beads  of  the  model  are  shown.  The  thick  dash  lines  represent  the  hydrogen 

bonds  and  the  thin  dashed  lines  indicate  the  auxiliary  constraints  for  the  formation  of 

hydrogen  bond.  (B)  The  histogram  of  distances  between  the  hydrogen  bonded  oxygen 

and nitrogen as well as the distance of the auxiliary constraints, which is calculated for 

the hydrogen bonds in crystal structures. 

 

27

Table 1: We denote the distance of the covalent bonds between beta and gamma beads as dβγ, and the distances of the auxiliary bonds between 
alpha and gamma beads as dαγ. For the second gamma beads Cγ2 of the β-branched residues Thr, Val, Ile, we denote the distance between Cβ 
and Cγ2 beads as dβγ2, the distance between Cα and Cγ2 beads as dαγ2, the distance between Cγ and Cγ2 beads as dγγ2. For the bulky amino acids, 
Arg,  Lys  and  Trp,  we  introduce  an  effective  Cδ  bead  and  denote  the  distances  between  Cδ  and  Cβ  and  between  Cδ  and  Cγ  as  dβδ  and  dγδ 
respectively. For the distance constraints, we allow a variance of ±2% unless it is specified in the table. All the distances are in the unit of Ǻ and 
the masses are in the unit of the atomic mass of carbon, mC.

Table  2:  The  parameters  of  the  rotamer  constraints:  d0,  d1  and  d2.  The  parameters  dmin 
and dmax is not sensitive for sensitive for the correct modeling of the rotamer (Figure 1a). 
Therefore, we assign 2.0Ǻ and 6.0Ǻ for dmin and dmax, respectively. For Trp the constraint 
to model χ2 is between Cα and the Cδ beads.

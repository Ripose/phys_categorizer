The  last  decade  has  witnessed  a  rapid  progress  in  the  new 
chemistry  of  small  metal  clusters  of  Al,  Si  and  Ga  facilitated  by 
computational  strategy,  synthesis  and  characterization.1-3  These 
metal clusters have a close resemblance with the cyclic organic π-
conjugated  molecules  in  structure  as  well  as  properties.    Al4Li4 
4-  follow  the  properties  of 
and  their  anions,  Al4Li3
cyclobutadiene  (C4H4).4  They  also  undergo  interaction  with 
transition  metals  like  Fe  and  Ni  to  form  complexes  of  the  type 
type: 
(Al4Li4)-Fe(CO)3  and  sandwich  complexes  of 
(Al4Li4)2Ni thereby resembling C4H4 in its role as a ligand.5  Al4
4- 
also  satisfies  the  simple  Huckel  criteria  for  antiaromaticity  as  it 
possess  4π  electrons  in  its  frontier  π-orbitals.    Despite  these 
similarities  between  these  all-metal  systems  and  their  organic 
counterpart  (C4H4),  serious  doubts  have  recently  been  raised 
whether  these  systems  are  aromatic  or  antiaromatic,  based  on  π-
electron  scheme  alone.6-7    The  σ-backbone  appears  to  be  quite 
important  and  based  on  nucleus  independent  chemical  shift 
(NICS), Schleyer and co-workers suggested that these clusters are 
net aromatic. But  Boldyrev, Wang and co-workers concluded that 
-  and  Li4Al4  clusters  are  net  antiaromatic.  Santos  and  co-
Li3Al4
workers  agreed  with  the  net  antiaromaticity  of  these  clusters  on 
the basis of electron localization function (ELF) analysis.8
      In this letter we show that the confusion associated with these 
clusters  can  be  settled  through  a  simple  σ-π  separation  analysis 
which provides an unambiguous answer to all such questions. The 
different results obtained by the previous workers arise primarily 
because of the indirect methods used to characterize aromaticity/ 
antiaromaticity.  We  stress  that  the  σ-backbone  is  quite  an 
important  component  in  the  structural  features  of  almost  all 
molecular  systems.  Even  in  C6H6,  it  has  been  found  that  the  σ-
backbone is responsible for the symmetric D6h structure and the π-
electrons actually tend to distort the symmetric structure.9-10  

2-,  Ga4Li4,  Al4

We  have  considered  a  variety  of  molecular  systems:  Al4Li4, 
2-  and  compared  with  C4H4  and  similar 
Al4Li4
organic analogues at each step of our σ-π analysis. These systems 
have  either  4π,  6π  or  2π  electrons  in  their  frontier  orbitals  and 
provide  a  diverse  set  for  studying  aromaticity  or  antiaromaticity. 
All the geometries were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G++ (d, p) 
level11-12  (see  supporting  information  file  for  structures  and 
energies). The ground state geometry for both  Al4Li4 and Ga4Li4 
have a planar rectangular structure for the the ring with the Li ions 
occupying  positions  so  as  to  maintain  a  C2h  architecture.  The 
bond-length alteration (BLA) for  Al4Li4 and Ga4Li4 are 0.12 and 
0.16  Å  respectively.  Note  that  the  same  for  C4H4  is  0.2  Å  .  The 
fact that the BLA for Ga4Li4 is more than that in Al4Li4 suggests 
that  Ga4Li4  is  more  antiaromatic  than  Al4Li4,  in  analogy  with 
C4H4  and  a  σ-π  separation  should  be  ideal  to  quantify  such  a 
statement.  
     We  distort  the  geometry  optimized  structures  by  ∆R  (where 
∆R is the difference between the long M-M and short M-M bond 

4-

in  the  M4  ring)  so  that  that  the  distortion  keeps  the  sum  of  two 
adjacent  M-M  bonds  constant  [Scheme  1  (a)].  The  energy 
associated  with  the  distortion  is  partitioned  into  σ  and  π 
components as ∆Eπ = ∆EGS - ∆Eσ. One of the simplest methods to 
get the contribution associated with a distortion only along the σ-
backbone  is  to  freeze  the  π-electrons  with  all-parallel  spins.  The 
σ-backbone  for  a  M4  ring  with  4π  electrons  can  be  modeled  as 
M4
  with  a  H.S  configuration  (S=2)  with  all  the  4π  electrons 
being  parallel  [Scheme  1  (b)].  Similarly,  for  the  2π  electron 
2+  and  Al4
2-,  S=1  corresponds  to  the  H.S  state. 
sytems  like    C4H4
2-  however,  there  are  only  four  π-orbitals  and 
For  the  6πe  Al4Li4
thus  a  H.S  configuration  with  S=3  is  not  feasible,  rather  two 
2-  corresponds  to  the  H.S 
parallel  spins  with  S=1  state  in  Al4Li4
state. We thus define,  ∆Eσ=∆EHS. Such an analysis gives a very 
clear  picture  of  the  nature  of  interactions  in  the  system  and  has 
been  extensively  used  in  the  literature  for  various  organic 
molecules.  13-14  For  the  HS  systems,  we  perform  UB3LYP 
calculations  at  the  same  basis  set  level  with  annihilation  of  the 
first spin-contaminant.

the ground state. Li atoms not shown for the sake of clarity. (b) The 
distortion  in the σ – electrons involving the distortion in a high spin 
configuration.  

   In  Figure  1,  we  plot  the  σ-energy  and  the  π-energy  as  a 
function  of  the  distortion  parameter,  ∆R.  In  the  inset,  the  core 
energy,  Vcore  (sum  of  kinetic  energy  and  nuclear-electron  (ne) 
interactions), electron-electron interactions (Vee) and the nuclear-
nuclear interactions (Vnn) are plotted. For all the systems, we find 
that the π-electrons have a general tendency of forming distorted 
structure  (π-energy  is  most  stable  at  large  ∆R)  while  the  σ-
framework oppose the distortion and tends to equalize the bonds. 
The  final  structure  and  thus  the  aromatic/antiaromatic  features 
will crucially depend on the predomination of either of the forces.  
In  Figure  1(a),  the  result  for  the  well-known  C4H4  system  is 
shown.  The  instability  associated  with  the  σ-backbone  distortion 
is  very  little  (4  kcal/mol  for  ∆R=0.1)  while  the  stability  for  π-

distortion  is  quite  substantial  (22  kcal/mol  for  ∆R=0.1),  clearly 
overwhelming the tendency for σ-backbone equalization. Thus the 
C4H4 has a rectangular structure and is overall π-antiaromatic with 
a minor σ-aromatic component. Both Vee and Vnn are destabilized 
with  distortion  while  the  Vcore  component  is  stabilized.  We  have 
further analyzed that it is the Vne term in the Vcore that favors the 
distorted  structure.  This  is  easy  to  understand  as  the  Vne 
component is associated with the electron-lattice interactions and 
lead  to  Jahn-Teller  stabilization  in  the  distorted  structure. 
However  components  like  Vee  and  Vnn  stabilizes  the  ∆R=0 
structure associated with the delocalized π-electrons (for  nonzero 
∆R, the electron density is localized in shorter bonds).  

For  the  all-metal  system  however,  the  σ-π  separation  energy 
play a crucial role. For example, in Al4Li4, the distortion in the σ-
framework leads to a destabilization of 2.5 kcal/mol while the π-
framework gains energy of 3.5 kcal/mol (Figure 1(b)). The ground 
state  energy  is  thus  stabilized  by  the  distortion  along  the  ring.  
Accordingly  thus  the  Al4Li4  is  π-antiaromatic  though  the  σ-
aromatic component is also substantial. However overall Al4Li4 is 
antiaromatic as the π-antiaromaticity exceeds the σ-aromaticity by 
1  kcal/mol.  The  energy  components  also  follow  very  similar 
trends  like  that  for  C4H4  (Fig.  1(b),  inset).  We  derive  similar 
conclusion  for  the  Ga4Li4  also  and  the  π-stabilization  associated 
with  the  distortion  is  4  kcal/mol  while  σ-destabilization  is  2.5 
kcal/mol (seen in Fig. 1(c)). The distorted π-antiaromatic structure 
is thus stabilized by an amount of 1.5 kcal/mol, 0.5 kcal/mol more 
than that for Al4Li4. Thus the π-antiaromaticity follows the order: 
C4H4 > Ga4Li4 > Al4Li4.  

 

true for C6H6 where σ-delocalization exceeds the π-localization by 
6  kcal/mol.15-16  In  Fig.  2  (a),  the  energy  profile  is  plotted  for 
2+ which shows an overwhelming π-delocalization compared 
C4H4
to  the  smaller  σ-localization.  Similarly,  for  the  all-metal  system, 
2-, the ground state corresponds to a square geometry with Al-
Al4
Al bond length=2.54 Å. This is readily understood from the plot 
as the π-destabilization associated with the distortion exceeds the 
stability  in  the  σ-backbone  due  to  distortion  (Fig.  2  (b))  though 
again the energy scales for the σ and π distortion are comparable. 
Also, as a general rule, we find that the Vne term favors distortion.

      In summary, we have shown that all-metal molecular clusters 
like Al4Li4 and Ga4Li4 are predominately π-antiaromatic  although 
there  is  a  significant  contribution  from  the  σ-aromaticity  as  well 
due  to  close  proximity  in  σ/π  energy  scales  compared  to  the 
equivalent organic systems. We believe that our analysis provides 
a  tool  for  assignment  of  aromaticity/antiaromaticity  in  all-metal 
clusters.

(a)  C4H4  (b)  Al4Li4  (c)  Ga4Li4  and  (d)  Al4Li4
(Al4Li4)Fe(CO)3.   The  insets  show  Vcore  (green), Vee  (black)  and Vnn 
(red)  components  in  the  ground  state  structures.  All  the  energies  are 
scaled to make the most stable geometry zero in energy and positive 
values in Energy-axis correspond to destabilization. 

The fact that this simple σ-π separation gives a very clear picture 
for  the  nature  of  aromaticity/antiaromaticity  is  evident  from  Fig. 
1(d).  We  retrieve  the  structure  of  the  Al4Li4  unit  from  the 
organometallic complex (Al4Li4) Fe (CO)3 and consider the Al4Li4 
dianion  system.  The  interaction  of  the  Fe(CO)3  unit  with  the 
Al4Li4 converts it into a 6π aromatic system with small BLA. In 
Fig.  1(d)  we  distort  this  dianion  of  Al4Li4  and  perform  similar 
the 
analysis.  Contrary 
stabilization  associated  with  the  equalization  of  the  σ-backbone 
overwhelms  the  instability  due  to  π-electron  localization  by  0.5 
kcal/mol  and  forces  the  system  to be  aromatic. This  is  of  course

A σ-π separation analysis of the energies in Al4Li4 reveals that the system is more π-antiaromatic than the σ-aromaticity in it. 
This  is  true  also  for  C4H4  and  Ga4Li4.  Unlike  C4H4  that  has  a  very  large  component  of  π-antiaromaticity,  for  these  all-metal 
clusters, these energy scales are comparable though π-antiaromaticity is the major driving force for the distortion of the these 
2-, the 
molecules from the square (σ-aromatic) structure to the rectangular (π-antiaromatic) architecture. For the dianion Al4Li4
2+,  π-equalization  is  the  driving  force  for  the 
σ-equalization  prevails  over  the  π-distortion  in  Al4Li4  and  for  the  dication  Al4Li4
square symmetric structure.

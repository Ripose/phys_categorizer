Abstract:  We  report  on  33  %  efficient  generation  of  the  first  Stokes  in  a  high 
concentration GeO2 fiber Raman laser pumped by a 22 W Thulium doped fiber laser. 
An output power of 4.6 W at 2.105 µm is demonstrated. 

Stimulated  Raman  scattering  (SRS)  has  enabled  the  development  of  a  wide 
variety  of  CW  fiber  lasers  and  amplifiers  at  wavelengths  for  which  there  are  no 
rare-earth  doped  gain  media  available.  Recently  Raman  lasers  have  been 
demonstrated in photonic crystal1 and chalcogenide glass fibers2 allowing extension 
of  operational  wavelengths  of  fiber  lasers  beyond  the  waveguiding  loss  and  single 
mode  propagation  regions  of  conventional  silica-based  fibers.  For  generation  of 
Raman  fiber lasers  with wavelengths beyond  2 µm the rapidly increasing losses  of 
the  bulk  silica  impose  a  limit  on  long  wavelength  operation  of  conventional  silica 
fibers.  

Alternative  oxide-based  glass  forming  hosts,  such  as  high  concentration 
GeO2, were first suggested in 19753 as a material to produce low loss optical fibers. 
Shortly  after  a  comparison  of  the  Raman  scattering  cross-sections  and  Stokes 
4  indicated  that  the  cross-
intensity  of  vitreous  bulk  SiO2,  GeO2,  B2O3  and  P2O5
section  in  GeO2  is  nearly  an  order  of  magnitude  greater  than  that  of  SiO2.  It  has 
also  been  shown  that  the  intrinsic  infrared  absorption  of  GeO2  glass  is  shifted  to 
longer  wavelengths  as  compared  to  silica  glass  because  germanium  atoms  have  a 
greater  mass  than  silicon  atoms,  making  GeO2  a  better  candidate  for  Raman 
generation  in  the  infrared.  Doping  of  silica  fibers  with  low  concentrations  of  GeO2 
has  been  routinely  used  to  enhance  Raman  gain.  However  manufacturing  of  high, 
above  20-40  mol.%,  concentration  GeO2  core  fibers  has  until  recently  faced 
problems.5  These  problems  arise  from  the  mismatch  of  the  thermal  expansion 
coefficients of GeO2 and SiO2 combined with the narrow temperature range between 
nonsintering and the evaporation of the GeO2.   

Manufacturing  of  single-mode  fibers  with  core  concentration  of  51  to  97 
mol.%  GeO2  was  first  reported  in  2004.5,6  Apart  from  lower  losses  above  2  µm 
these  fibers  possess  a  significantly  enhanced  nonlinearity  as  compared  with  silica 
fibers.  The  combination  of  these  two  advantages  makes  the  highly  doped  GeO2 
fibers an excellent candidate for extending Stokes generation in optical fibers in the 
infrared.  This  potential  has  been  demonstrated  by  using  pump  sources  based  on 
ytterbium  and  erbium  doped  fiber  lasers.5-7  As  the  Raman  gain  coefficient  of  such 
fibers is about an order of magnitude higher than that in silica fibers the increasing 
losses  with  wavelength  can  be  compensated  for  by  using  much  shorter  lengths  of 
fiber  for  Raman  generation.  Here  we  report  on  the  efficient  generation  of  a  high 
power  Raman  source  at  2.1  µm  in  a  75  mol.%  GeO2  fiber  directly  pumped  with  a

single-mode  thulium  doped  fiber  laser.  This  approach  allows  for  a  high  optical  to 
optical and overall efficiency to be achieved in the wavelength region above 2 µm. 

The  experimental  setup  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  A  22  W,  1.938  µm,  ~1  nm 
linewidth,  single-mode  CW  thulium  (Tm)  doped  fiber  laser  (IPG  Photonics)  was 
employed as a pump. The free-space output of the Tm laser was bulk coupled into 
the  GeO2  fiber  avoiding  spurious  back-reflection  from  the  Raman  laser  cavity  into 
the Tm laser. To reduce the  thermal  load in the coupling  setup an optical chopper 
with a 25 % duty factor was used. The pump light was coupled into a short length 
of  STF  (standard  telecom  fiber)  with  an  efficiency  of  up  to  80  %.  The  STF  was 
directly spliced to the 75 mol.% GeO2 fiber using a mode-field matching technique 
on an arc-fusion splicer which resulted in regular splices losses of less than 0.5 dB. 
Two fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) at 2.105 µm corresponding to the first Raman shift 
of the pump wavelength, a high reflector (HR, R > 99 %) and output coupler (OC, R 
~50 %), were written in the same GeO2 fiber and formed the Raman laser cavity. 
Due  to  the  high  photosensitivity  of  the  GeO2  fiber  the  gratings  were  directly 
recorded  with  244  nm  laser  radiation  without  hydrogen  loading  of  the  fiber.8  The 
gratings’  spectral  properties  were  controlled  during  manufacturing  by  taking  into 
account  a  calculated  dispersion  and  measuring  the  second  diffraction  order.  The 
fiber’s core doping concentration was 75 mol.% of GeO2 (25 mol.% SiO2), it had a 
measured mode field diameter of 2.5 µm and a single mode cut off wavelength of 
~1.4  µm.  The  measured  loss  in  the  1.938  µm  region  was  21  dB/km  increasing  to 
52-56 dB/km at 2.105 µm. This compares favorably to SiO2 fiber, which has losses 
of  ~16  and  110  dB/km  at  1.94  and  2.11  µm  respectively.  A  cut  back  experiment 
with  five  GeO2  fiber  cavity  lengths  of  10.3,  17.5,  26.3,  33.5  and  42.5  m  was 
performed. Due to the high NA of the GeO2 fiber a short length of STF (~5 cm) was 
spliced  to  the  end  of  it  to  reduce  the  output  NA  for  measurements.  Spectral 
measurements  were  made  using  an  automated  Spex  500  spectrometer  in 
combination with a PbS IR detector and lock-in amplifier.  

The spontaneous Raman signals were first investigated by direct pumping of 
a 42.5 m long GeO2 fiber at 20 W pump level resulting in signals at 2.113 µm and 
2.322 µm (Fig. 2). Initially, the 42.5 m long cavity was built with HR and OC FBGs 
centered at 2.105 µm. This wavelength was slightly short of the peak spontaneous 
Raman gain but due to the broad GeO2 Raman gain such detuning should not affect 
the efficiency.4 The cutbacks were made in order to maximize the output power at 
2.105 µm. This was initially assessed by taking into account the fiber losses at 2.1 
µm  and  the  single-pass  effective  Raman  interaction  length,  (1-exp(-αL))α-1,  while 
ignoring  the  pump  depletion.  Here  α  is  the  fiber  attenuation  and  L  is  the  fiber’s 
physical  length.  It  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  3  that  the  resulting  slope  efficiency  was 
identical  for  the  10.3  and  42.5  m  cavities  while  in  the  26.3  m  long  cavity  the 
highest  Raman  generation  efficiency  was  obtained.  A  maximum  output  power  of 
4.61  W  (1.15  W  average  with  the  choppers  duty  factor  of  25  %)  with  a  FWHM 
bandwidth  of  2.4  nm  (Fig.  3  inset)  was  achieved  in  this  cavity  with  a    slope 
efficiency  of  33  %,  defined  as  the  output  signal  power  over  the  absorbed  pump 
power.  The lasing linewidth is related to the width of the HR and OC FBGs as the 
resolution of the spectrograph was in the sub-nm range. 

Fig.  4  illustrates  the  residual  pump  power  dynamics  versus  the  input  pump 
power  level.  For  the  26,  33  and  42  m  cavities  the  residual  pump  power  remains 
largely  saturated  within  the  1.5  to  2.0  W  region.  Optimization  of  the  gain-loss

balance  by  taking  into  account  the  pump  depletion  and  by  changing  the  OC  FBG 
reflectivity  should  allow  higher  efficiencies.  Further  improvements  to  the  current 
cavity  geometry  may  be  possible  by  utilizing  the  residual  pump  in  the  cavity 
through  the  addition  of  a  blocking  FBG  at  the  pump  wavelength  after  the  OC 
grating.  

We  estimated  the  Raman  gain  coefficient,  gR,  at  2.1  µm  by  taking  into 
account the experimentally measured  cavity losses  and threshold pump  powers as 
6.2  ±  1.1  x10-13  m/W.  The  error  in  this  case  is  associated  with  the  uncertainty  in 
reflectivity  value  of  the  OC  FBG.  The  estimated  value  of  gR  is  over  an  order  of 
magnitude  higher  than  the  peak  Raman  gain  of  a  silica  fiber  (~4.7 x10-14 m/W  at 
2.11 µm).  

The  much  weaker  second  order  Stokes  at  2.322  µm,  observed  from 
spontaneous Raman generation (Fig. 2), offers an opportunity to produce a Raman 
laser  at  this  wavelength.  However  an  estimated  5-fold  increase  in  transmission 
losses  and  a  reduction  in  the  Raman  gain  proportional  to  the  inverse  wavelength 
will require the use of short linear cavities, in similar or reduced concentration GeO2 
fibers, in order to achieve Raman generation at this wavelength. 

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a 4.6 W CW generation around 2.1 µm 
in  a  linear  Raman  laser  cavity  based  on  a  75  mol.%  GeO2  fiber.  The  high 
concentration  germanium  fiber  provided  significantly  enhanced  Raman  gain  and 
lower optical losses above 2 µm compared with standard silica fibers. By employing 
direct pumping with a 1.938 µm thulium fiber laser a slope efficiency of 33 % at 2.1 
µm  was  achieved.    The  detection  of  a  weak  spontaneous  Raman  signal  at  2.3  µm 
opens  up  the  prospect  of  a  Raman  laser  at  this  wavelength  although  the 
considerable  increase  in  fiber  losses  at  this  wavelength  may  limit  the  output 
powers.

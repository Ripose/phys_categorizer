Abstract 
 

A  single  semiflexible  polymer  chain  folds  into  a  toroidal  object  under  poor 

solvent  conditions.    In  this  study,  we  examined  the  morphological  change  in such  a 

toroidal  state  as  a  function  of  the  width  and  stiffness  of  the  chain  together  with  the 

surface  energy,  which  characterizes  the  segmental  interaction  parameter.    Changes in 

the thickness and outer/inner radius are interpreted in terms of these parameters.    Our 

theoretical  expectation  corresponds  to  the  actual  morphological  changes  in  a  single 

giant DNA molecule as observed by electron microscopy.

INTRODUCTION 

It is well known that a toroid structure is generated from a giant DNA molecule  

upon  the  addition  of  condensing  agents  such  as  multivalent  cations,  polyamines  and 

neutral flexible polymers1-8.    After a full survey of previous experimental studies on  a 

DNA  toroid,  Bloomfield  stated  that  “---  the  major diameter  of  the  condensed  particle  

remains  almost  constant  on  the  order  of  60-80  nm and  does  not  seem  to  depend  upon 

the length of  an  individual DNA  molecule,  so  long  as  the  DNA  length  is  from  400  to 

over  40,000  base  pairs  (bp).”9      In  contrast,  it  has  been  reported  that  a  giant  toroid 

larger  than  150  nm  in  diameter  is  generated  under  conditions  in  which  the  attractive 

interaction  between  segments  is  weak3.    Several theoretical  and experimental  reports 

on  the  stability  of  a  toroid  have  been  published10-19.    For  example,    Ubbink  and 

Odijk11  calculated  the  energy  of  a  toroid  by  changing  the  surface  tension,  or  the 

attractive  potential  between  segments,  under  the  framework  of  a  constant  toroidal 

volume.    They  showed  that  the  major  diameter  increased  and  the  thickness,  or  minor 

diameter,  decreased accompanied by  a  decrease  in  the  surface  tension.    Park  et  al.12 

theoretically  examined  the  effect  of  disordered  packing  on  a  toroid by  analyzing  the 

defect energy.    Vasilevskaya et al.13 reported a mean- field approach on the stability of a 

toroid,  with  emphasis  on  the  transition  between  an  elongated  coil  and  a  compact 

2 

toroidal state.    Miller et al.14 compared the free energy of a toroid with a hollow sphere, 

and found that the free energy of a hollow sphere becomes lower than that of a toroid 

accompanied  by  the  increase  in  the  characteristic  parameter  a

, which  was  first 

introduced by Ubbink and Odijk11.     

It has become clear that the conformational  transition of a single semiflexible 

polymer from a coil into a toroidal structure can be interpreted in terms of the first-order 

phase  transition  between  disordered  and  ordered  states20.    This  phase  transition 

exhibits  unique  characteristics  as  a  finite  system,  and  shows  that  a  toroidal  structure 

may  be  destabilized  when  the  length  of  the  polymer  chain  becomes  infinitely  long.   

Thus, the surface energy plays a significant role in determining the stable structure of a 

folded compact state in a single semiflexible chain.     

In  the  present  study,  we  examined  the  morphological  change  in  a  toroidal 

structure.    We  studied  the  effects of  physico-chemical  properties  such as the  stiffness 

and thickness of a chain with  an approximate analytical treatment.    Semi-quantitative 

agreement  with  actual  experimental  results  with  a  single  giant  DNA  molecule  is 

demonstrated.

THEORETICAL ANALYSIS 

(i)  Method     

Figure  1  shows  a  schematic  drawing  of  the  setting  for  this  analysis.    We 

consider  the  upper  half  of  a  cross-section  of  a  toroid  under  the  assumption  of 

axisymmetry.    The shape of the cross-section of a toroid (x, y) can be approximated by 

the product of a line and a semicircle as follows;

    (1) 

where  c,  d,  r  and  R  are  the  toroidal  parameters  that  characterize  the  toroidal 

morphology,  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.    We  adopt  two  effective  property  parameters  for a 

polymer,  physico-chemical  parameters,  normalized  by  the  toroidal  surface  tension  s

: 

the thickness D and the persistence length P of a polymer.    Throughout this paper, we 

set s =0.75.   Based on  this condition, the following equations are given for the bending 

energy of a polymer  Fb,  the  surface  energy  of  a  toroid  Fs,  and  the  contour  length  of a 

polymer L:

around  the  cross-section.    We  consider  a  toroid  formed  from  a single polymer chain 

with a constant contour length  L.    With this constraint, we can decrease the number of 

variables to three.    Thus, we consider the effect of  the physico-chemical parameters on 

the toroidal parameters, c, r and R, in the present study.    The total energy F is given as 

By  minimizing  equation  (5)  with  respect  to  these  three  parameters,  we  can  obtain  the

optimum dimension of a toroid.   

(ii) Result 

Figure  2  shows  the  relationship between each  physico-chemical parameter, D 

and  P,  and  the  toroid al  parameters,  r,  R  and  c.    A  compact  toroid  (c,  r  and  R  nearly 

equal  to  0,  10  and  30  respectively)  appears  when  D=1.58  and  P=50,  and this shows a 

typical  toroidal  shape  that  has  been  frequently  reported  in  past  studies9.    Figure  2a 

shows the  effect of  D on  r,  R  and  c  under  P=50.    With an  increase  in  D,  r  and  R 

increase,  whereas  c  decreases.    As  depicted  in  the  figure,  with  an increase  in thickness 

D, the compact toroid becomes swollen and globular where the inner diameter becomes 

much smaller.    In addition,  the inner hole of  the toroid disappears for sufficiently large 

D, where r equals R.   

5 

 

 

Figure 2b shows  the effect of  P on  r, R and c when D=1.58.    With an increase 

in P, R and  r  increase.    This  means that the inner diameter of a toroid increases with an 

increase in  P.    For sufficiently small P, the inner hole of a toroid disappears, indicating 

that a toroid  can  not  be  formed.         

Based on  these results regarding the effects of D and P, it  is possible to predict 

the  formation of a giant  toroid by adopting proper values of P and D, as shown  in Fig.

2c. 

 

 

 

 

 

In  this  section,  some  of  the  above  theoretical  considerations  are  discussed in 

connection with the experimental  results with toroids formed from the same giant DNA 

T4 phage DNA, 166 kbp with a contour length of 57  m m,  was  purchased  from Nippon 

Gene 

(Toyama, 

Japan). 

  Maltosylated  amino-pendant  polyethylene  glycol 

(Mal-PEG-A) was also used.  Samples A were prepared by adding 0.6 mM spermidine 

to 0.3 m M DNA solution.    Samples B were prepared by adding Mal-PEG-A to 0.6 m M 

6 

DNA  solutions.    They  were  mounted  on  carbon-coated  copper  grids  (200  mesh), 

negative-stained  with  1  %  uranyl  acetate,  and  observed  with  a  JEOL  1200EX 

transmission electron microscope (TEM; Tokyo, Japan) at 100kV.  

(ii) Result 

Figure  3  shows  the  transmission  electron  microscopic  (TEM)  images  of  T4 

DNA.    Figure  3a  shows  the  shape  of  a  compact  toroid  obtained  with  sample  A.    

Figure 3b shows a globular toroid with sample B, where DNA is folded with a relatively 

large  excluded  volume  using  a  condensing  agent.    In  other  words,  the  effective 

thickness  of  a  DNA  chain  is  expected  to  be  markedly  larger  than  that  of  usual 

double-stranded  DNA.    Figure  3c  shows  a  giant  toroid  formed at a  high spermidine 

concentration  (6.0  mM).    Past  studies on  DNA  compaction  with  polycations suggest 

that the  attractive  interaction  between  DNA  segments  becomes  weaker  at  such  a  high 

concentration of spermidine3, which corresponds to a decrease in surface tension s

. 

DISCUSSION 

We  have  advocated  the  minimal  model  to  clarify  the  relationship  between 

polymer properties and  toroidal  morphology.    This model offers two  merits.    First,  we 

7 

 

 

 

 

 

can determine the shape of the cross-section of a toroid.    Next,  from  an experimental 

point  of  view,  we  can  determine  the  effect  on  DNA  of  a chemical  added  to  the  DNA 

solution by  considering  the  image  of  a  toroid;  by determining  whether  the  chemical 

effectively changes the thickness or stiffness of a DNA chain.   

 

In this paper, we  did not account for  electronic  interaction, including the effect 

of  counter  ions,  in  an  explicit  manner  in  the  analysis  of  the  stability  of  a  toroidal 

structure.    It may  be  important to note that the large morphological change  in a toroid, 

as  in  Fig.  3,  can  be  reproduced  even  without  considering  such  an  electronic  effect. 

However,  a  unique  structure  such  as  interchain  segregation  has  been  found  to  be 

generated through the effect of  a surviving  negative charge21, 22.    In the present paper, 

we studied the   morphological variation  of a toroid assuming  a stable form as a  toroid.   

When we consider the kinetics of the folding process of a polymer, other structures such 

as a rod will appear with the same property parameters23, 24.

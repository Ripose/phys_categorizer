In  this  letter  we  investigate  the  scaling  behavior  of  the  average  daily  exchange  rate 

returns of the Indian Rupee against four foreign currencies namely US Dollar, Euro, Great 

Britain Pound and Japanese Yen. Average daily exchange rate  return of the  Indian Rupee 

against US Dollar is found to exhibit a persistent  scaling behavior and follow Levy  stable 

distribution.  On  the  contrary  the  average  daily  exchange  rate  returns  of  the  other  three 

foreign currencies show randomness and follow Gaussian distribution.

Financial  market  is  an  example  of  a  strongly  fluctuating  complex  system  with 

large number of interacting elements. Physicists always find interest in the study of the 

dynamics of complex systems. For this reason they got attracted to the field of economics 

and a new subject  “Econophysics” [1] emerged. The complexity of its internal elements, 

external  factors  acting  on  it  and  the  unknown  nature  of  the  interactions  between  the 

different comprising elements make the study of a financial market the most complicated 

and  challenging  one.  In  the  recent  years,  new  and  sophisticated  methods  have  been 

invented  and  developed  in  statistical  and  nonlinear  physics  to  study  the  dynamical  and 

structural properties of various complex systems. These methods have been successfully 

applied  in  the  field  of  quantitative  economy  [1-3],  which  gave  a  chance  to  look  at  the

economical  and  financial  data  from  a  new  perspective.  The  exchange  rates  between 

currencies are particularly interesting category of economic data to study as they dictate 

the  economy  of  most  countries.  The  time  dependence  of  the  exchange  rates  is  usually 

complex  in  nature  and  hence,  it  is  interesting  to  analyze  using  the  newly  developed 

statistical methods.  In  this  letter  we  report the study of detailed scaling behavior of the 

average daily exchange rate returns of Indian Rupee (INR) versus four important foreign 

currencies in Indian economy, namely the US Dollar (USD), the EURO, the Great Britain 

Pound (GBP) and the Japanese YEN for the past few years. India, being the country with 

second  largest  population  in  the  world,  is  an  important  business  market  for  the 

multinational companies. Therefore the study of the average daily exchange rate returns 

of  Indian  Rupee  with  respect  to  the  four  foreign  currencies  is  very  significant  and 

relevant from the economic point of view. 

Scaling as a manifestation of underlying dynamics is familiar throughout physics. 

It has been instrumental in helping scientists gain deeper insights into problems ranging 

across  the  entire  spectrum  of  science  and  technology.  Scaling  laws  typically  reflect 

underlying  generic  features  and  physical  principles  that  are  independent  of  detailed 

dynamics or characteristics of particular models. Scale invariance seems to be widespread 

in natural systems [4]. Numerous examples of scale invariance properties can be found in 

the  literature  like  earthquakes,  clouds,  networks  etc.  [5-8].  Scaling  investigation  in  the 

financial  data  has  been  recently  got  much  importance.  In  the  literature,  many  empirical 

studies  can  be  found  which  show  that  financial  time  series  exhibit  scaling  like 

characteristics [9-13]. However, some literature continued to question the evidence of the 

scaling laws in the foreign exchange markets. LeBaron [14,15] examined the theoretical 

 

2

foundation  of  scaling  laws  and  demonstrated  that  many  graphical  scaling  results  could 

have  been  generated  by  a  simple  stochastic  volatility  model.  He  suggested  that  the 

dependence  in  the  financial  time  series  might  be  the  key  cause  in  the  apparent  scaling 

observed. His model was able to produce visual power-laws and long memory similar to 

those observed in financial data of comparable sample sizes. However Stanley et al. [16] 

pointed out that a three-factor model cannot generate power-law behavior. 

Thus, it is still an open question of the scaling behavior of financial time series. 

We  have  studied  the  daily  evolution  of  the  currency  exchange  data  [17]  of  INR-USD, 

INR-EURO,  INR-GBP  and  INR-YEN  for  the  period  of  August  1998  to  August  2004 

using  two  newly  developed  methods  namely  (i)  the  Finite  Variance  Scaling  Method 

(FVSM) (ii) the Diffusion Entropy Analysis (DEA) to reveal the exact scaling behavior 

of  the  average  daily  exchange  rate  returns.  The  return  Z(t)  of  the  exchange  rate  time 

series X(t) is defined as 

tZ

=

ln

. Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b show the variation of the

average daily exchange rates of INR against USD and its return respectively. 

 

Two complementary scaling analysis methods: FVSM and DEA [18-20] together 

are found to be very efficient to detect the exact scaling behavior of complex dynamical 

systems. The need for using these two methods to analyze the scaling properties of a time 

series is to discriminate the stochastic nature of the data: Gaussian or Levy [20,21]. These 

methods  are  based  on  the  prescription  that  numbers  in  a  time  series  {

( itZ

)}

  are  the 

fluctuations of a diffusion trajectory; see Refs. [19,22,23] for details. Therefore, we shift 

our attention from the time series  {

)}

 to probability density function (pdf) p(x,t) of 

( itZ

the  corresponding  diffusion  process.  Here  x  denotes  the  variable  collecting  the 

 

3

fluctuations  and  is  referred  to  as  the  diffusion  variable.  The  scaling  property  of  p(x,t) 

takes the form

In the FVSM one examines the scaling properties of the second moment of the diffusion 

process  generated  by  a  time  series.  One  version  of  FVSM  is  the  standard  deviation 

analysis (SDA) [19], which is based on the evaluation of the standard deviation 

)(tD

of 

the variable x, and yields  [4,19].

The exponent γis interpreted as the scaling exponent. 

      DEA  introduced  recently  by  Scafetta  et  al.  [18]  focuses  on  the  scaling  exponent  δ 

evaluated through the Shannon entropy s(t) of the diffusion generated by  the fluctuations 

)}

of the time series using the pdf (1) [18,19]. Here, the pdf of the diffusion process,

Eq. (3) indicates that in the case of a diffusion process with a scaling pdf, its entropy  ( )ts

 

increases  linearly  with 

.  Finally  we  compare 

γ  and  δ.  For  fractional  Brownian 

ln

( )t

motion the scaling exponent δ coincides with the γ [19]. For random noise with finite 

variance, the pdf 

)txp ,
(

 will converge to a Gaussian distribution with γ= δ=0.5. If γ ≠ 

δ the scaling represents anomalous behavior.

The plots of SDA and DEA for the average daily exchange rate returns of the four 

foreign  currencies  are  shown  in  Fig.  2  and  Fig.  3  respectively.    The  scaling  exponents 

obtained from the plots of SDA and DEA are listed in Table I. The values of γ and  δ 

clearly reflect that the INR-USD exchange rate returns behave in a different manner with 

respect to the other three exchange rate returns. For INR-USD exchange rate returns the 

scaling  exponents  are  found  to  be  greater  than  0.5  indicating  a  persistent  scaling 

behavior. While the unequal values of γ and δ implies anomalous scaling. For the other 

three exchange rate returns, the values of  γ and  δ are almost equal to 0.5 within their 

statistical error limit, signifying absence of scaling in those cases.   The results obtained 

from SDA and DEA seem to be surprising as all the exchange rate return time series data 

are from the same foreign exchange market. To confirm the observations obtained from 

the  results  of  SDA  and  DEA,  we  applied  another  well-established  method  namely  R/S 

Analysis to the average daily exchange rate return data.  

Range/Standard  (R/S)  deviation  analysis  also  referred  to  as  rescaled-range 

analysis  was  originally  developed  by  Hurst  [24].  The  R/S  analysis  is  performed  on  the 

discrete  time-series  data  set  {

)}

of  dimension  N  by  calculating  the  accumulated 

( itZ

departure, Y(n,N), according to the following formula:

  respectively  imply  persistent  and 

antipersistent long range correlation. The plots and the Hurst exponents obtained from the 

R/S analysis for the average daily exchange rate returns of the four foreign currencies are 

shown  in  Fig.4.  The  results  of  the  R/S  analysis  confirm  the  persistent  scaling  in  INR-

USD exchange rate return data and randomness in other exchange rate returns. 

 

The primary objectives of these analyses were to find the generic feature of these 

time  series  data,  their  long  range  correlation  and  their  robustness  to  retain  the  scaling 

property.  To  verify  the  robustness  of  the  observed  scaling  property  of  INR-USD 

exchange rate return data, we corrupted 2% of  the  exchange  rate  return  data  at  random 

locations  by  adding  noise  of  magnitude  of  the  multiple  of  the  standard  deviation  (std). 

We  found  that  addition  of  noise  of  magnitude  of  five  times  of  the  std  the  scaling 

exponents did not change and the scaling behavior is retained by an addition of noise of 

magnitude of fifteen times of std. Which confirms the robustness of the scaling property 

of the INR-USD exchange rate return data. We have also analyzed the probability density 

distribution  of  the  exchange  rate  returns.  The  distributions  are  fitted  with  Levy  stable 

distribution,  which  is  expressed  in  terms  of  its  Fourier  transform  or  characteristic 

function, 

)(qϕ ,  where  q  is  the  Fourier  transformed  variable.  The  general  form  of  the 

characteristic function of a Levy stable distribution is:

0>η   is  a  scale  parameter,  and  ∈ξ ℜ  is  a  location 

parameter which is also called mean. For Cauchy and Gaussian distribution, the values of 

α are equal to 1 and 2 respectively. A typical fit [25] of the Levy stable distribution for 

INR-USD returns is shown in Fig. 5. The parameters of the fitted Levy stable distribution 

for the average daily exchange rate returns of the four currencies are presented in Table 

II.    From  Table  II  it  is  seen  that  the  value  of α  in  case  of  INR-USD  exchange  rate  is 

1.3307  indicating  the  distribution  is  of  Levy  type  but  for  the  other  cases α  values  are 

close  to  the  Gaussian  limit  2.  Which  is  also  an  indication  of  the  randomness  in  those 

exchange rate returns. 

 

The  political  development  inside  and  outside  a  country  affects  its  economy  and 

the  foreign  exchange  market.  The  cross  currency  volatility  also  influences  a  particular 

kind  of  exchange  rate.  The  world  economy  experienced  one  of  the  worst  shocks  in  the 

aftermath of September 11, 2001 events in the United States. Foreign exchange market in 

India  also  became  volatile  (shown  in  Fig.  1a).  Another  large  fluctuation  in  INR-USD 

exchange  rate  is  observed  around  31  March  2004.  These  fluctuations  in  the  INR-USD 

exchange  rate  did  not  affect  its  robust  scaling  property.  We  argue  this  is  due  to  the 

dissipation of the fluctuation in the vast economy of a country like India. The interacting 

elements provide a retarding path to the fluctuations in a financial market. As the number 

of interacting element increases the channel for the fluctuation dissipation gets broaden. 

 

7

USD is the most important foreign currency in the Indian economy. Hence, the number of 

interacting elements is more in the INR-USD exchange market. Possibly this is the reason 

behind  the  observed  robustness  of  the  scaling  property  in  the  INR-USD  average  daily 

exchange rate returns.  

          The exchange rate management policy continues its focus on smoothing excessive 

volatility  in  the  exchange  rate  with  no  fixed  rate  target,  while  allowing  the  underlying 

demand and supply conditions to determine the exchange rate movements over a period 

in  an  orderly  way.  Towards  this  end,  the  scaling  analysis  of  the  foreign  exchange  rate 

data is of prime importance. We have carried out extensive studies on the average daily 

exchange rate returns from Indian foreign exchange market. From the analyses we have 

found  that  the  average  daily  exchange  rate  return  of  USD  exhibits  scaling  and  follows 

Levy Stable distribution. On the contrary, the average daily exchange rate returns of the 

other  foreign  currencies  namely  EURO,  GBP  and  YEN  do  not  follow  scaling  and  they 

are found to obey Gaussian distribution.

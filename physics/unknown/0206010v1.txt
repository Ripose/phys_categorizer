Abstract 

A  matrix  inverse  free  method  to  solve  time-dependent  Schrödinger  equation  is 

presented. The method is not subject to form of Hamiltonian and adopting real space grid 

system such as structured and unstructured grid, and achieves the order N algorithm even 

if we adopt unstructured grid systems to adjust complex regions. We have demonstrated 

some error evaluation problems that have exact solution and application in which it has 

non-Schrödinger type Hamiltonian, and we have successfully simulated the time-evolution 

of wave function for all of the case.

I．Introduction 

Understanding  of  electron  characteristics  as  quantum  dynamics  is  fundamental 

theme in all fields of physics and chemistry. In addition, it becomes also important in the 

engineering  fields  in  relating  to  handle  nano-technology  recently.  Especially  ,when  we 

consider  (1)quantum  dot  and  wire[1,2]  ,(2)quantum  chaos[3,4]  ,(3)quantum  tunneling[5] 

and  (4)scattering[6],  how  to  solve  initial  condition  (IC)  and  boundary  condition  (BC) 

problem of time dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) is an important theme. 

From  the  viewpoint  of  the  numerical  solution,  this  problem  results  in  the 

proposition of the search of space discretization schemes and time integration algorithms. 

For space discretization, the methods are classified as real space methods such as finite

deference  method(FDM)  ,finite  element  method(FEM)  and  solving  the  plane  wave 

expansion with the aid of    fast Fourier transform(FFT). 

Until now, it has been common way to make use of plane-wave expansion for space. 

It  is  still  a  mainstream  in  first-principle  molecular  dynamics  and  band  calculation  at 

present.  It  is  true  that  the  plane  wave  expansion  method  has  the  highest  accuracy  and 

resolution for identical orthogonal grid system. However, it can not be called the technique 

which is not always optimum concerning the calculation cost, when we treat the case in 

which wave function exists locally or there are coarse and dense distribution of potential 

field in computational region, and when we    mind parallel computing which is a trend in 

the  age.  There  are  several  reports  on  real-space  method,  based  upon  such  recognition. 

However, until now, real-space computations are executed only in orthogonal grid or body 

fitted coordinate(BFC), and the report which adopts the more flexible unstructured grid is 

not observed[7-13].     

In the meantime, in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the problem of 

this  kind  is  deeply  tackled,  and  the  rapid  progress  has  already  been  accomplished. 

Proposal  and  selection  of  the  scheme  of  the  limitless  number  have  been  repeated. 

Following  the  recent  studies  of  CFD,  beyond  the  use  of  structured  grid,  such  as 

(1)orthogonal or (2) BFC one, there is grid system optimization step in the unstructured 

grid  system.  In  addition,  CFD  has  the  solution-adaptive-grid  technology,  which 

dynamically reconstructs the grids in the point where higher resolution is required [14]. 

There exist great numbers of idea which should be imported from CFD techniques, when 

electron  wave-function  must  be  traced  in  problems  such  as  quantum  chaos,  scattering 

and moving potential field situation in first principle molecular dynamics[14]. 

In  CFD,  spectral  method,  called  as  “plane  wave  expansion”  in  the  field  of 

computational  physics,  is  no  longer  used  except  for  the  basic  research  of  turbulent  flow 

phenomena  In  addition,  the  recent  research  begins  to  have  demonstrated  that  the 

performance of FDM, by adopting more than fourth order space accuracy, is equivalent to 

that of spectral method[15,16].    The search for real space methodology, if it is led by the 

knowledge  of  CFD,  can  be  called  as  a  trend  in  next  generation  in  the  computational 

physics.   

It seems that the real space methods, proposed until now, have not been completed 

yet.    For  example,  the  differential  operator  splitting  approach  cannot  be  applied,  when 

one aims at the unstructured grid. Meanwhile, the multi-step method is explicit method, so 

it performs on unstructured grid. But, explicit time integration method does not conserve 

the  norm  of  wave  function  generally.    For  this  problem,  Iitka[7]  proposed  a  solution  by 

adopting  higher  order  time  integration  approach.  However,  it  is  desirable  that  the  time 

 

2

integration  is  essentially  unitary,  when  practical  and  complicated  problems  are  handled 

and  considered.  In  short,  the  symmetrical  treatment  in  the  time-direction,  as  is 

represented  by  Crank-Nicolson  method,  becomes  indispensable  in  solving  TDSE.    It 

means that the inverse problem of sparse matrix should be solved in the unstructured grid 

system.  In  the  solution  method  of  the  sparse  matrix,  the  problem  of  fill-in  arises,  when 

direct method was adopted, and it is not desirable because many machine memories are 

required. In the iteration methods such as conjugate gradient method, extra work area is 

required and in addition, the total amount of the numerical operation increases because of 

the requirement for the repeated calculation. 

Concerning with these problems, we propose a scheme that makes Hamiltonian into 

discrete one at first and next decomposes the exponential operator into LDU form. By this 

scheme,  we  have  succeeded  in  the  development  of  high-speed,  grid-system-adoptive  and 

memory-saving computational method, which is free from matrix calculation.   

This method is the order N algorithm which is perfectly proportional to number of non-zero 

element of discretized Hamiltonian matrix.   

In  section  2,  universality  and  superiority  of  present  approach  namely  “Matrix 

Inverse  Free  Method”  is  discussed.  In  section  3,  several  problems  in  which  the  exact 

solution  exists  are  taken  up,  and  the  error  evaluation  is  carried  out.  In  section  4,  the 

simple application to non-Schrödinger type differential operator is demonstrated. In last 

section, some problems of present method are arranged as concluding with future prospect. 

 
II．Formulation 

Ａ．Concept：Path of Solving Process     

When there is no time-dependence term in Hamiltonian, the formal solution of wave 

function can be written as follows.

Two paths will be available as the procedure for obtaining numerical solution based on this 

formal solution.     

(1) Path Type I 

Hamiltonian.     

Step1)  The  solution  is  formally  obtained,  using  the  differential  operator  expression  of 

Step2) The exponential operator is decomposed into simple operator product.     

Step3) Decomposed exponential operator is expanded as Tayler series.

Step4) The expanded differential operator is finally discretized by a certain way, such as 

difference calculus. 

This approach is the method proposed by Watanabe et al. [10,11]. 

(2) Path Type II 

Step1)  First,  Hamiltonian  is  discretized,  and  it  is  converted  into  simultaneous  ordinary 

differential equations on the finite dimensional wave function vector,

wave-function  and  H   is  discrete  representation  of  Hamiltonian  operator 

Step2) The formal solution of ordinary differential equation on vector form is obtained as,     

Step3) Superscript matrix of the exponential function is decomposed.     

Step4) Finally, each of decomposed exponential matrix operators is expanded with respect 

to  Δt.     

The  latter  path  is  the  approach  which  De  Raedt[13]  and    our  present  work  have 

adopted.  The  difference  of  these  two  approaches  is  whether  or  not  the  discretization  is 

executed first. However, it leads two approaches to decisively different style. 

Ｂ．Algorithm：Matrix Inverse Free Method 

Generally, it is possible to decompose matrix H in lower, diagonal and upper form as 

a triangular matrix,

For Universality： 

1. The scheme is not subject to the change on the space dimension.

2.  The  scheme  is  not  subject  to  the  change  on  the  lattice  system  such  as  structured  or

unstructured grid. 

Hamiltonian representations.     

4. Present scheme is able to treat arbitrary periodic problem by ghost cell techniques. 

For Computational Cost： 

In case of the calculation with second order special accuracy in structured grid, since 

only  tri-diagonal  matrices  are  generated  by  the  expansion  in  xyz  axes,  the  direct 

calculation  is  possible  by  the  disorption  method[10,11].  Therefore,  the  inverse  matrix 

calculation is substantially unnecessary. However, such an advantage in this approach is 

lost  in  the  unstructured  grid  systems.    In  this  case,  the  use  of  the  linear  solver  for  the 

sparse  matrix  is  required  in  the  simplicity.  For  sparse  matrix,  direct  methods  are  not 

desirable because the“fill-in”  is occurred. This leads machine memory increasing. In the 

meantime, the total amount of the numerical operation. 

As for the present algorithm, even in such cases, the inverse matrix calculation is 

not required and the calculation is possible with the computational cost in proportion to 

the number of the off-diagonal non-zero elements.

exact solution, and it is shown to be the equivalent performance with past methods in case 

In  imaginary  time  direction,  time-dependent  Schrödinger  equation’s  problems  are 

analogues to initial and boundary condition problems in classical diffusion process. This is

on  the  off-diagonal  of  the  row  that  corresponds  to  the  grid  points  in  neighbor  of  fixed 

boundary points, and the numerical errors concentrate there.      But, such situation is not

The  finite  element  method  was  adopted  for  the  discretization  of  Hamiltonian,  and  the 

linear  element  is  used  as  the  basis  function.  In  present  work,  the  mass  matrix,  which 

arises  with  respect  to  the  time  term,  was  diagonalized  by  lumped  mass  approximation.   

After  the  scaling  of  both  sides  in  the  equations  by  the  diagonalized  mass  matrix,  the 

exponential  operator  expression  is  constructed  and  the  LU  decomposition  method  was 

applied.    Result  of  the  calculation  are  shown  at  table  I.  Details  of  this  computation

method”  that  has  been  presented  by  Abuduwali et al  [17]  is  almost  equivalent  to  the 

method  that  Watanabe   et al.    have  proposed  for  2-dimensional  case[10,11].    It  is 

verified that, even in this case, the present algorithm maintains the accuracy of the same 

grade as Crank-Nicolson method, which is the standard solution method of problem of this 

kind. 

Ｂ．Wave Packet Problem 

The  problem  by  Watanabe  et  al.  is  taken  up[10].  In  this  problem,  all  of 

computational  conditions  are  exactly  the  same  that  the  other  worker  has  adopted.  The 

details  are  given  in  the  literature  of  reference[10].    It  is  obvious  that  the  present  work 

gives the result that is similar to the other works, as is shown in table II.    Also present 

work gives well approximated values in comparison with exact values.

The  LDU  decomposition  scheme  for  quantum  electron  dynamics  proposed  in  the 

present  work  can  be  applied  to  various  systems,  in  which  the  Hamiltonian  is  not 

necessarily expressed by the differential operator of Schrödinger type. For example, it will 

be applicable to the case where the equation for the “effective” Hamiltonian is given as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(20) 

and  the  suitable  finite-difference  representation  is  given.  In  addition,  the  LDU 

decomposition scheme can be applicable to the case in which the Hamiltonian is expressed 

as “tight-binding” matrix form. In this section, an example of this is given.  We consider a 

model described by a bracket Hamiltonian including multi-channel scattering between the 

two states “e” and “h” as follows.

In the above, the states “e” (“h”) defined on l-th atomic site is expressed as |l;e(h)>. 

The parameters T and  Δ(l) are the hopping integral and the pair potential between states 

“e” and “h” on l-th site. We can trace the time-evolution of the wave-function expressed as 

vector form, spanned by <ψ|l;e> and <ψ|l;h>, making use of    matrix representation of 

the Hamiltonian <l|H|l’> 

In the uniform system, i.e.,  Δ(l)=Δ  on all sites, the energy band is given as

In the above, parameter “a” means the distance of the nearest atoms. In the crystal 

with the band structure as above, there is no state with energy E, such as |E|<|Δ| or 

|E|>|2T|.  Hence,  only  the  electron  waves  of  |Δ|  ≦|E|  ≦|2T|  can  propagate  there.   

Even if electron wave  with energy E, such as |E|<|Δ|,    is injected from the outside of 

 

 

 

9

the crystal, it will be reflected backwardly.   

We have successfully simulated the time-evolution of the wave packet in a junction 

system, where the pair potential  Δ(l)≠0 acts in a “scattering” zone of finite length. The 

detailed  condition  for  the  calculation  is  shown  in  the  table  III.  In  this  case,  due  to  the 

presence  of  pair  potential,  the  energy  gap  at  E～0  exists  locally  in  the  scattering  zone.   

The initial wave packet, lying channel “e” only,    is taken to be the following form,

at n-th  atomic  site,  so  that  the  main  part  of  the  initial  packet  is  located  outside  of  the 

scattering zone. Hence the initial wave-function is assumed to lie in the part of the crystal 
2
T
where the band structure is given as 
,sinceΔ(l) is zero there. From the

scattering zone, since the packet momentum 

viewpoint of the energy band,    the wave-packet is emitted toward the “energy gap” of the 
0p   is set to be 1/2(π/a). Figures show the 
calculated result of the time-evolution of the wave packet. After 2000 time steps, the wave 

packet is split into two parts, which separately go in the opposite directions(Figure 3). The 

behavior of the packet can be explained by the discussion of    “band gaps” as above. The 

left-going packet mainly consists of the partial wave, which justly injects into the energy 

gap of the scattering zone, being reflected backward by the energetic reason. On the other 

hand, the right-going packet is the set of waves, which tunnel through, or, go outside of , 

the  “energy  gap”  in  the  scattering  zone.    In  the  figure  4,  which  shows  the  k-space  FFT 

spectrum of the wave-function, such a situation can be seen as the depression at k～1/4(π

/a) of the plotted spectrum for wave-function of state “h” and also as the peak of that for 

state  “e”  at  k～3/4(π/a).  Throughout  the  simulation,  the  norm  and  the  energy  of  the 

wave-function is well conserved also in this example.

V．Conclusion 

In conclusion, we have developed a new order N algorithm for the time-dependent 

Shrödinger equation that is the Matrix Inverse Free Method.    By this algorithm, explicit 

time  integration  procedure  has  become  possible  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  implicit 

time-discretization  formulation  must  be  adopted  to  conserve  the  norm  of  wave  function.   

Also, this algorithm has invariance for utilizing spatial grid system and Hamiltonian type. 

In this article, we have briefly described the basic idea of the method by illustrating 

performance  with  evaluating  problem  in  which  it  has  exact  solution  and  numerical 

application  to  multi-channel  scattering  problem.  From  these  demonstrations,  we  have 

found  that  the  present  algorithm  is  quite  efficient  for  simulating  time-evolution of  wave 

function. But also we have found that approximation error increases nearby the boundary 

on which Diriclet condition is cast. This error may be critical for the case of quantum chaos 

simulation  because  the  reflection  of  wave  function  at  infinite  potential  wall  is  key 

phenomenon.  For  this  problem,  reducing  of  the  error  will  become  possible  by  adopting 

higher accurate discretization scheme for time and spatial directions. We will improve and 

resolve in future work.

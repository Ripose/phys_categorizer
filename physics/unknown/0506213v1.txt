ABSTRACT 

Even  before  9/11  there  were  claims  that  the  nature  of  war  had  changed 
fundamentally1. 
  The  9/11  attacks  created  an  urgent  need  to  understand 
contemporary  wars  and  their  relationship  to  older  conventional  and  terrorist  wars, 
both of which exhibit remarkable regularities2-6.  The frequency-intensity distribution 
of fatalities in "old wars", 1816-1980, is a power-law with exponent 1.80(9)2.i  Global 
terrorist attacks, 1968-present, also follow a power-law with exponent 1.71(3) for G7 
countries and 2.5(1) for non-G7 countries5. Here we analyze two ongoing, high-profile 
wars on opposite sides of the globe - Colombia and Iraq.  Our analysis uses our own 
unique dataset for killings and injuries in Colombia, plus publicly available data for 
civilians killed in Iraq.  We show strong evidence for power-law behavior within each 
war.    Despite  substantial  differences  in  contexts  and  data  coverage,  the  power-law 
coefficients  for  both  wars  are  tending  toward  2.5,  which  is  a  value  characteristic  of 
non-G7  terrorism  as  opposed  to  old  wars.    We  propose  a  plausible  yet  analytically-
solvable model of modern insurgent warfare, which can explain these observations.

In two celebrated papers3,4 Lewis Richardson showed that war casualties follow a 

power law distribution, i.e. the probability that a given war has  x  victims,

 over a reasonably wide range of  x , with  C  and α positive coefficients. This in turn

wars, 1820-1997, obey a power law.  Each data point is a casualty count for an entire war in 

these studies.  Casualty numbers in global terrorist events, 1968 to present, also obey power 

laws where in this case each data point is a terrorist attack5.  

While many people believe that 9/11 fundamentally changed the nature of warfare, 

some analysts had discerned new wars emerging even before this disaster1.  Thomas 

Hammes views “fourth generation wars”, as trenchantly exposited by Mao Tse-tung, as the 

prevalent form of contemporary warfare7,8.  These are conflicts in which incumbents with 

overwhelming military and economic superiority face extremely patient insurgents seeking 

to break their enemies’ political will through persistent and demoralizing attacks.  The 

phenomenon covers numerous well-known cases including Viet Nam, Iraq, Afghanistan, 

Israel-Palestine and Al-Qaeda7.  Thus, fourth generation warfare encompasses both global 

terrorism5 plus a variety of civil and/or international wars as commonly understood. 

Here our contribution is threefold.  First, we analyze detailed daily data for two 

specific ongoing wars in Colombia and Iraq and find that both obey power laws.  Thus, we 

extend Richardson’s fundamental insight into the micro world of single conflicts.  Second, 

we show that the power-law coefficients for both wars are drifting strikingly close to the 

global terrorism coefficient for non-G7 countries5. Thus, at least these two examples of

modern warfare increasingly resemble both each other and global terrorism in non-G7 

countries.  This finding resonates strongly with the notion of the rise of fourth generation 

warfare7.  Third we propose a micro conflict model that can explain our results.  

Figure 1 shows log-log plots of the fraction of all recorded events for that particular 

war with  x  or more victims,

, versus  x .  For Colombia we are able to work with 

the very broad measure of all conflict-related killings plus injuries.  For the Iraq data we 

work with killings of civilians as provided by the Iraq Body Count Project.  The straight 

lines over long ranges in Figure 1 suggest that both these wars follow power laws.  The 

Colombia data displays an extraordinary fit for a social science application while the Iraq 

data also fits well except for a bulge in the 150 to 350 range.  Since we have many more 

Colombia events than Iraq ones, the superiority of the Colombia curve is not surprising.  

Nevertheless, the rest of the Iraq curve fits well enough so as to suggest that we should 

expect more events in the 150-200 range in the future. (The inset to Figure 1 shows a 

shortage of events in the 150-200 range. The cumulative distribution therefore exhibits a 

bulge, which eventually disappears around 350).

estimate of civilian deaths from www.iraqbodycount.com.  For Colombia, the 
severity is taken to be the total number of deaths plus injuries from the 
CERAC dataset9.  Each line indicates the most likely power law that fits the 
data (see text).  The inset shows a histogram of the Iraq data set and points 
to a shortage of attacks with severity in the range 150-200; this shortage 
creates the bulge in the Iraq line in the main figure.  

Using well-established methods2, as explained in the Methods and Supplementary 

Information sections, we have verified that each cumulative distribution in Figure 1 

satisfies a power-law relationship over a very wide range. We also find robust power-law 

behavior for data collected over smaller time-windows, as discussed below, and have hence 

deduced the evolution of the power-law coefficient α over time by sliding this time-

window through the data-series. Figure 2 shows these empirically-determined α values as 

 

5 

a function of time for both conflicts.  The α values in both cases are tending toward 2.5, 

which is the coefficient for global terrorism in non-G7 countries. The implication is that 

both these wars and global non-G7 terrorism are beginning to share a similar underlying 

structure. This finding is consistent with the idea of the increasing prevalence of fourth 

generation warfare7. The Methods and Supplementary Information sections provide details 

of the tests we performed to verify the robustness of our results.

(red) and Colombia (blue).  The straight lines are fits through these points, 
and suggest a common value of approximately 2.5 for both wars in the near 
future. The values for G7 and non-G7 terrorism are also shown5. See text for 
details of how the variation through time of α is calculated.  

 

5

6 

There is a need for a model which can explain this common value of α≈ 2.5.  

Standard physical mechanisms for generating power laws make little sense in the context of 

Colombia or Iraq2.  One might instead guess that casualties would arise in rough proportion 

to the population sizes of the places where insurgent groups attack: given that city 

populations may follow a power law2, it is conceivable that this would also produce power 

laws for the severity of attacks.  However, we have tested this hypothesis against our 

Colombia data and it is resoundingly rejected.   

Instead, we have developed a new model of modern insurgent warfare. As shown in 

Figure 3, and explained in detail in the Supplementary Information section, our model 

assumes that the insurgent force operates as a collection of fairly self-contained units, 

which we call 'attack units'. Each attack unit has a particular 'attack strength' characterizing 

the average number of casualties arising in an event involving this attack unit. As time 

evolves, these attack units either join forces with other attack units (i.e. coalescence) or 

break up (i.e. fragmentation). Eventually this on-going process of coalescence and 

fragmentation reaches a dynamical steady-state which is solvable analytically, yielding 

5.2=α

. This value is in remarkable agreement with the α  values to which both Colombia 

and Iraq appear to be tending (recall Figure 2). It also suggests that similar distributions of 

attack units might be emerging in both Colombia and Iraq, with each attack unit in an 

ongoing state of coalescence and fragmentation. Our model also offers the following 

interpretation for the dynamical evolution of α  observed in Figure 2. The Iraq war began 

as a conventional confrontation between large armies, but continuous pressure applied to 

the Iraqis by coalition forces has fragmented the insurgency into a structure in which 

smaller attack units, characteristic of non-G7 global terrorism, now predominate.  In 

Colombia, on the other hand, the guerrillas in the early 1990’s had even less ability than 

 

6

global terrorists to coalesce into high-impact units but have gradually been acquiring 

comparable capabilities. 

7 

Figure 3  Our analytically-solvable model describing modern insurgent 
warfare. The insurgent force comprises attack units, each of which has a 
particular attack strength. The total attack strength of the insurgent force is 
being continually re-distributed through a process of coalescence and 
fragmentation.  Mathematical details are provided in the Supplementary 
Information section. 

 

More generally, our results – combined with those of Clauset and Young, and 

Richardson – suggest that there are power laws between wars, power laws for global 

terrorism and power laws within contemporary wars. That is, power laws have an 

 

7

extraordinary range of applicability to human conflict, both on the large and the small 

scale. In addition, our finding that the statistical patterns of the intra-war events in 

Colombia and Iraq appear to be trending toward the same value as global terrorist incidents 

in non-G7 countries (i.e. 

5.2=α

) suggests that such global terrorist incidents can 

themselves be viewed as intra-war events within some larger, on-going yet ill-defined 

“global war”.  This leaves open the possibility that the spatio-temporal correlations between 

events within a particular war, are related to those at play in global terrorism. We leave this 

intriguing discussion to a later publication. 

Methods 

Data Sources 

 

 

We make extensive use of our own CERAC dataset for Colombia9 plus publicly available 

data on Iraq (www.iraqbodycount.org).  The CERAC data builds on primary source 

compilations of violent events by Colombian human rights NGO’s and from local and 

national press reports.  We distil from this foundation all the clear conflict events, i.e., those 

that have a military effect and reflect the actions of a group participating in the armed 

conflict.  For each event we record the participating groups, the type of event (massacre, 

bombing, clash, etc.), the location, the methods used and the number of killings and injuries 

of people in various categories (guerrillas, civilians, etc.).  This data set covers the years 

1988-2004 and includes 20,251 events. The Iraq Body Count Project monitors the reporting 

of more than 30 respected online news sources, recording only events reported by at least 

two of them.  For each event they log the date, time, location, target, weapon, estimates of 

the minimum and maximum number of civilian deaths and the sources of the information.  

8 

8

The concept of civilian is broad, including, for example, policemen.  The list of events, 

posted online, covers the full range of war activity, including suicide bombings, roadside 

bombings, US air strikes, car bombs, artillery strikes and individual assassinations.  The 

data set covers the period from 2003 to the present and includes 1,746 events. 

Power Law Calculation

for which the power law is thought to hold.  The formula α= 1+ n

estimates the power-law exponent while jackknife resampling estimates the error in α. To 

check these results, we then estimated α using least-square regression on the observations 

above  minx

.  For both the Iraq and the Colombia data we obtained nearly identical point 

estimates of very high significance, with nearly null p-values using White-

heteroskedasticity-corrected robust standard errors.  We then performed robustness checks 

by excluding outliers and high-leverage observations from the regressions, finding only 

marginal changes in parameter estimates. 

Variation through time of α 

We apply the above procedures by varying  minx

 for each estimate and also by using a fixed 

minx

 for all the estimates, and find no significant differences.  The Colombian coefficients 

are calculated for two-year intervals displaced every 50 days.  The Iraq coefficients are 

calculated for one-year intervals displaced every 30 days.  The differences in calculation 

procedures were necessitated by the relatively shorter run of the Iraq data compared to the 

Colombia data.

PART 1:    Detailed discussion of the model introduced in the paper 

Here we provide details of the model of modern insurgent warfare, which we introduced in 

the main paper. Our goal is to provide a plausible model to explain (i) why power-law 

behaviour is observed in the Colombia and Iraq wars, and (ii) why the power-law 

coefficients for the Colombia and Iraq wars should both be heading toward a value of 2.5. 

In other words, why should a modern war such as that currently underway in Colombia 

or Iraq, produce power-law behaviour and why should the value of 2.5 emerge as a 

power-law coefficient? 

Our model bears some similarity to a model of herding by Cont and Bouchaudiii, and 

is a direct adaptation of the Eguiluz-Zimmerman model of herding in financial marketsiv. 

The analytical derivation which we present, is an adaptation of earlier formalism laid out by 

D’Hulst and Rodgersv, and also draws heavily on the material in the book Financial Market 

Complexity by Neil F. Johnson, Paul Jefferies and Pak Ming Hui (Oxford University Press, 

2003). One of us (NFJ) is extremely grateful to Pak Ming Hui for detailed correspondence 

about the Eguiluz-Zimmerman model of financial markets, the associated formalism, and 

its extensions – and also for discussions involving the present model.  

As suggested by Figure 3 in the paper, our model is based on the plausible notion that 

the total attack capability of an insurgent force in ‘fourth-generation’ warfare, is being

continually re-distributed. Based on our intuition about such guerilla-like wars, we consider 

the insurgent force to be made up of attack units or cells which have certain attack 

strength (see below for a detailed discussion). One might expect that the total attack 

strength for the entire insurgent force would change slowly over time.  At any particular 

instant, this total attack strength is distributed (i.e. partitioned) among the various attack 

units -- moreover the composition of these attack units, and hence their relative attack 

strengths, will evolve in time as a result of an on-going process of coalescence (i.e. 

combination of attack units) and fragmentation (i.e. breaking up of attack units). Such a 

process of coalescence and fragmentation is realistic for an insurgent force in a guerilla-like 

war, and will be driven by a combination of planned decisions and opportunistic actions by 

both the insurgent force and the incumbent force. For example, separate attack units might 

coalesce prior to an attack, or an individual attack unit might fragment in response to a 

crackdown by the incumbent force. Here we will model this process of coalescence and 

fragmentation as a stochastic process.  

 

Each attack unit carries a specific label 

i, j,k,K and has an attack strength denoted by 
 

si,s j,sk,K respectively. We start by discussing what we mean by these definitions: 
  

attack unit or cell: Here we have in mind a group of people, weapons, explosives, 

machines, or even information, which organizes itself to act as a single unit. In the case of 

people, this means that they are probably connected by location (e.g. they are physically 

together) or connected by some form of communications systems. In the case of a piece of 

equipment, this means that it is readily available for use by members of a particular group. 

The simplest scenario is to just consider people, and in particular a group of insurgents 

which are in such frequent contact that they are able to act as a single group. However we 

 

12

13 

emphasize that an attack unit may also consist of a combination of people and objects – for 

example, explosives plus a few people, such as the case of suicide bombers. Such an attack 

unit, while only containing a few people, could have a high attack strength. In addition, 

information could also be a valuable part of an attack unit. For example, a lone suicide 

bomber who knows when a certain place will be densely populated (e.g. a military canteen 

at lunchtimes) and who knows how to get into such a place unnoticed, will also represent 

an attack unit with a high attack strength. 

attack strength: We define the attack strength  si of a given attack unit  i, as the average 

number of people who are typically injured or killed as the result of an event involving 

attack unit  i. In other words, a typical event (e.g. attack or clash) involving group  i will 

lead to the injury or death of  si people. This definition covers both the case of one-sided 

attacks by attack unit  i (since in this case, all casualties are due to the presence of attack 

unit  i) and it also covers two-sided clashes (since presumably there would have been no 

clash, and hence no casualties, if unit  i had not been present). 

We take the sum of the attack strengths over all the attack units (i.e. the total attack 

strength of the insurgent force) to be equal to  N . From the definition of attack strength, it 

follows that  N  represents the maximum number of people which would be injured or killed 

in an event, on average, if the entire insurgent force were to act together as a single attack 

unit. Mathematically, 

∑ = N . For any significant insurgent force, one would expect 

si
i, j,k,K

N >> 1. The power-law results that we will derive do not depend on any particular choice 

of  N . In particular, the power-law result which is derived in this Supplementary 

Information section concerning the average number  ns of attack units having a given attack 

strength  s, is invariant under a global magnification of scale (as are all power-laws).  

 

13

14 

The model therefore becomes, in mathematical terms, one in which this total attack 

strength  N  is dynamically distributed among attack groups as a result of an ongoing 

process of coalescence and fragmentation. As a further clarification of our terminology, we 

will now discuss the two limiting cases which we classify as the ‘coalescence’ and 

‘fragmentation’ limits for convenience: 

• 

‘Coalescence’ limit: Suppose the conflict is such that all the attack units join 

together or coalesce into a single large attack unit. This is the limit of 

complete coalescence and would correspond to amassing all the available 

combatants and weaponry in a single place – very much like the armies of the 

past would amass their entire force on the field of battle. Hence there is one 

large attack unit, which we label as  i and which has an attack strength  N . All 

other attack units disappear. Hence  si → N . This ‘coalescence’ limit has the 

minimum possible number of attack units (i.e. one) but the maximum possible 

attack strength (i.e.  N ) in that attack unit. 

• 

‘Fragmentation’ limit: Suppose the conflict is such that all the attack units 

fragment into ever smaller attack units. Eventually we will have all attack 

units having attack strength equal to one. Hence  si →1 for all 

i = 1,2,K,N . 
  

This would correspond to all combatants operating essentially individually. 

This ‘fragmentation’ limit has the maximum possible number of attack units 

(i.e.  N ) but the minimum possible attack strength per attack unit (i.e. one). 

 In practice, of course, one would expect the situation to lie between these two limits. 

Indeed, it seems reasonable to expect that these attack units and their respective attack 

strengths, will evolve in time within a given war. Indeed, one can envisage that these attack 

units will occasionally either break up into smaller groups (i.e. smaller attack units) or join 

 

14

15 

together to form larger ones. The reasons are plentiful why this should occur: for example, 

the opposing forces (e.g. the Colombian Army in Colombia, or Coalition Forces in Iraq) 

may be applying pressure in terms of searching for hidden insurgent groups. Hence these 

insurgent groups (i.e. attack units) might either decide, or be forced, to break up in order to 

move more quickly, or in order to lose themselves in the towns or countryside.  

Hence attack units with different attack strengths will continually mutate via 

coalescence and fragmentation yielding a ‘soup’ of attack units with a range of attack 

strengths. At any one moment in time, this ‘soup’ corresponds mathematically to 

partitioning the total  N  units of attack strength which the insurgent army possesses. The 

analysis which we now present suggests that the current states of the guerilla/insurgency 

wars in Colombia and Iraq both correspond to the steady-state limit of such an on-going 

coalescence-fragmentation process. It also suggests that such a process might also underpin 

the acts of terrorism in non-G7 countries, and that such terrorism is characteristic of some 

longer-term ‘global war’.  

Against the backdrop of on-going fragmentation and coalescence of attack units, we 

suppose that each attack unit has a given probability  p of being involved in an event in a 

given time-interval, regardless of its attack strength. For example, p could represent the 

probability that an arbitrarily chosen attack unit comes across an undefended target – or 

vice versa, the probability that an arbitrarily chosen attack unit finds itself under attack. In 

these instances, p should be relatively insensitive to the actual attack strength of the attack 

unit involved: hence the results which we shall derive for the distribution of attack 

strengths, should also be applicable to the distribution of events having a given severity. 

When obtaining our analytic and numerical results, we assume that the war has been 

 

15

16 

underway for a long time and hence some kind of steady-state has been reached. This latter 

assumption is again plausible for the wars in Colombia and Iraq. 

Given the above considerations, it follows that if there are, on average,  ns attack units 

of a given attack strength  s, then the average number of events involving an attack unit of 

attack strength  s will be proportional to  ns. We assume, quite realistically, that only one 

insurgent attack group participates in a given event. For example, an attack in which 10 

people were killed is necessarily due to an attack by a unit of attack strength 10. In 

particular, it could not be due to two separate but simultaneous attacks by a unit of strength 

6 and a unit of strength 4 (i.e. 6+4=10). Hence the number of events in which  s people 

were killed and/or injured, is just proportional to  ns. In other words, the histogram, and 

hence power-law, that we will derive for the dependence of  ns on  s, will also describe the 

number of events with  s casualties versus  s. Indeed, if we consider that an event will 

typically have a duration of T, and that there will only be a few such events in a given 

interval T, then these results should also appear similar to the distribution describing the 

number of intervals of duration T in which there were  s casualties, versus  s. This is indeed 

what we have found in our analysis of the empirical data.  

Given these considerations, our task of analyzing and deducing the average number 

of events with  s casualties versus  s over a given period of time, becomes equivalent to the 

task of analyzing and deducing the average number  ns of attack units of a given attack 

strength  s in that same period of time. This is what we will now calculate. We will start by 

considering a mechanism for coalescence and fragmentation of attack groups, before then 

finally deducing analytically the corresponding power-law behaviour and hence deducing a 

power-law coefficient equal to 2.5. 

 

16

17 

Consider an arbitrary attack unit  i with attack strength si. At any one instant in time, 

labelled  t , we assume that this attack unit may either: 

a)  fragment (i.e. break up) into  si attack units of attack strength equal to 1. This 

feature aims to mimic an insurgent group which decides, either voluntarily or 

involuntarily, to split itself up (e.g. in order to reduce the chance of being 

captured and/or to mislead the enemy).  

b)  coalesce (i.e. combine) with another attack unit  j of attack strength  s j, hence 

forming a single attack unit of attack strength  si + s j. This feature mimics two 

insurgent groups finding each other by chance (e.g. in the Colombian jungle) 

or deciding via radio communication to meet up and join forces.  

To implement this fragmentation/coalescence process at a given timestep, we choose an 

attack unit  i at random but with a probability which is proportional to its attack strength  si. 

With a probability ν, this attack unit  i with attack strength  si fragments into  si attack units 

with attack strength 1. A justification for choosing attack unit  i with a probability which is 

proportional to its attack strength, is as follows: attack units with higher attack strength are 

likely to be bigger and hence will either run across the enemy more and/or be more actively 

sought by the enemy. By contrast, with a probability  1−ν(

) , the chosen attack unit  i 

instead coalesces with another attack unit  j  which is chosen at random, but again with a 

probability which is proportional to its attack strength  s j. The two attack units of attack 

strengths  si and  sj  then combine to form a bigger attack unit of attack strength  si + s j. The 

justification for choosing attack unit  j  for coalescence with a probability which is 

proportional to its attack strength, is as follows: it is presumably risky to combine attack 

units, since it must involve at least one message passing between the two units in order to 

 

17

coordinate their actions. Hence it becomes increasingly less worthwhile to combine attack 

units as the attack units get smaller.  

This model is thus characterized by a single parameter ν. The set up of the model is 

shown schematically in the figure at the front of this Supplementary Information section, 

and in Figure 3 of the paper. The connectivity among the attack units is driven by the 

dynamics of the model. For very small ν (i.e. much less than 1), the attack units steadily 

coalesce. This leads to the formation of large attack units. In the other limit of ν→ 1, the 

system consists of many attack units with attack strength close to 1. A value of ν= 0.01 

corresponds to about one fragmentation in every 100 iterations. In what follows, we assume 

that ν is small since the process of fragmentation should not be very frequent for any 

insurgent force which is managing to sustain an ongoing war. Indeed if such fragmentation 

were very frequent, then this would imply that the insurgents were being so pressured by 

the incumbent force that they had to fragment at nearly every timestep. Hence that 

particular war would not last very long. It turns out that infrequent fragmentations are 

sufficient to yield a steady-state process, and will also yield the power-law behaviour which 

we observe for Colombia and Iraq.  

A typical result obtained from numerical simulations, for the distribution of  ns versus 

attack strength  s in the long-time limit (i.e. steady-state), is shown below in terms of  ns n1 :

Supplementary Figure 1:  Log-log plot of the number of attack units with attack 

strength s, versus attack strength s. Here  N = 10,000 and ν= 0.01. The results are 

obtained from a numerical simulation of the model. The initial conditions of this 

numerical simulation are such that all attack units have size 1. As time evolves, 

these attack units undergo coalescence and fragmentation as described in the text. 

In the long-time limit, the system reaches a steady state with a power-law 

dependence as shown in the figure, and with an associated power-law coefficient 

of 2.5 (i.e. 5/2). The deviation from power-law behaviour at large s is simply due to 

the finite value of N: since there can be no attack unit with an attack strength 

greater than N, the finite size of N distorts the power-law as s approaches N. 

We now provide an analytic derivation of the observed power-law behaviour, and 

specifically the power-law coefficient 2.5, in the steady-state (i.e. long-time) limit.

One could write a dynamical equation for the evolution of the model with different 

levels of approximation. For example, one could start with a microscopic description of the 

system by noting that at any moment in time, the entire insurgent army can be described by 

a partition 

{
l1,l2,K,lN
  

} of the total attack strength  N  into  N  attack units. Here  ls is the 

number of attack units of attack strength  s. For example 

{
0,0,K,1
 

} corresponds to the 

extreme coalescence case in which all the attack strength is concentrated in one big attack 

unit. By contrast, 

{
N,0,K,0
  

} corresponds to the case of extreme fragmentation in which all 

the attack units have attack strength of 1 (i.e. there are  N  attack units of attack strength 1). 

Clearly, the total amount of attack strength is conserved 

∑   =  N .  All that happens is 

ili

N

i=1

that the way in which this total attack strength N is partitioned will change in time.  

In principle, the dynamics could be described by the time-evolution of the probability 

function 

equation for 

[
p l1,l2,K,lN
  
[

dp l1,l2,K,lN
  

]: in particular, taking the continuous-time limit would yield an 

] dt  in terms of transitions between partitions. For example, the 

fragmentation of an attack unit of attack strength  s leads to a transition from the partition 
}. For our purposes, however, it is more 
{
l1,K,ls,K,lN

can be written as

∑ [l1,...,ls,K,lN ]⋅ ls . The sum is over all possible partitions.

independent. The time-evolution of  ns t[ ] can be written down either by intuition, or by

The terms on the right-hand side of Equation (0.1) represent all the ways in which  ns can 

change. The first term represents a decrease in  ns  due to the fragmentation of an attack unit 

of attack strength  s: this happens only if an attack unit of attack strength  s is chosen and if 

fragmentation then follows. The former occurs with probability  s ns N  (see earlier 

discussion) and the latter with probability ν. The second term represents an increase in  ns  

as a result of the merging of an attack unit of attack strength  s' with an attack unit of attack 

strength  s − s'

(

). The third term describes the decrease in  ns  due to the merging of an attack 

unit of attack strength  s with any other attack unit. For the  s = 1 case described by Equation 

(0.2), the chosen attack unit remains isolated; thus Equation (0.2) does not have a 

contribution like the first term of Equation (0.1). The first term which appears in Equation 

(0.2) reflects the increase in the number of attack units of attack strength equal to 1, due to 

fragmentation of an attack unit. Similarly to Equation (0.1), the last term of Equation (0.2) 

describes the merging of an attack unit with attack strength 1, with an attack unit of any 

other attack strength. Equations (0.1) and (0.2) are so-called ‘master equations’ describing 

the dynamics within the model. Note that for simplicity, we are only considering 

fragmentation into attack units of attack strength 1. However this could be generalized – 

indeed, we will look at more general fragmentations in future publications.

Equations of this type are most conveniently treated using the general technique of 

‘generating functions’. As the name suggests, these are functions which can be used to 

generate a range of useful quantities. Consider

∑

s' = 0

s ns =

G(s) 0[ ]

s!

where  y = e−ω  is a parameter. Note that  s ns N  is the probability of finding an attack unit 
of attack strength  s. If G y[ ] is known,  s ns is then formally given by  

where G(s) y[ ] is the  s-th derivative of G y[ ]with respect to  y . G(s) y[ ] can be decomposed 

G y[ ]= n1 y +

∑ y s' ≡ n1 y + g y[ ] 

s'n s'

∞

s' = 2

where the function  g y[ ] governs the attack-units’ attack-strength distribution  ns  for s ≥ 2. 
The next task is to obtain an equation for  g y[ ]. This can be done in two ways. One could 
)2
either write down the terms in  g y[ ]

 explicitly and then make use of Equation (0.3), or 

(

one could construct  g y[ ] by multiplying Equation (0.3) by e−ωs and then summing over s. 

The resulting equation is:

giving an error of < 0.05% for  s ≥ 2. This motivates us to take the logarithm of both sides 

of Equation (0.16) and then apply Stirling’s formula to each log-factorial term, as in 

Equation (0.17). We follow these mathematical steps (which were derived in the M.Phil.

For small values of ν, the dominant dependence on  s is therefore 

ns ~ s−5 2 hence ns ~ s−2.5 

(0.20) 

We have therefore shown analytically that the distribution of attack strengths will follow a 

power-law with a coefficient 2.5 (i.e. 5/2). As discussed earlier, we assume that any 

particular attack unit could be involved in an event in a given time interval, with a 

probability p which is independent of its attack size. Hence these power-law results which 

we have derived for the distribution of attack strengths, will also apply to the distribution of 

attacks of severity x. (Recall that the attack strength s is a measure of the number of 

casualties in a typical event, and that the severity x of an event is measured as the number 

of casualties). In other words, the same power-law exponent 2.5 derived in Eq. (0.20), will 

also apply to the distribution of attacks having severity x.  

Hence our model predicts that any guerilla-like war which is characterized by an 

ongoing process of coalescence and fragmentation of attack units, and hence an 

ongoing re-distribution of the total attack strength, will have the following properties:  

(i) The distribution of events with severity x will follow a power-law. This finding is 

consistent with the behaviour observed for the aggregated data in the Iraq and 

Colombia wars (see Figure 1 of the paper). 

(ii) The power-law distribution will, in the steady-state (i.e. long-time) limit, have a 

coefficient of 2.5. This is precisely the value to which the results for Colombia and 

Iraq currently seem to be heading (see Figure 2 of the paper). 

 

 

 

 

25 

25

26 

In the case of the Iraq war, we can go one step further by providing a simple 

generalization of the above model in order to offer an explanation for the evolution of the 

power-law coefficient throughout the war’s entire history (recall Figure 2 of paper). The 

above model is characterized by the probability ν together with the mechanism for attack-

unit coagulation and fragmentation. This value ν was chosen to be independent of the 

attack strength of the individual attack units involved. In this modification, we will keep the 

essential structure of the model, but we will add the modification that an attack unit will 

fragment with a probability which depends on its attack strength, and will coalesce with 

another attack unit with a probability depending on the attack strengths of the two attack 

units involved. With probability ν the randomly-chosen attack unit  i (chosen with 

probability proportional to the attack strength) will fragment into attack units of attack 
strength 1, with a probability  f si[ ] which depends on  si. With probability (1−ν)  the attack 

unit of attack strength  si coalesces with another randomly-chosen attack unit  j having 
attack strength  sj , with probability  f si[ ]f sj[ ]. They remain separated otherwise. With the 
choice  f s[ ]= 1 the original model is recovered. Analytically, this particular formulation of 

the fragmentation and coagulation process can be readily treated by the generating function 

approach discussed earlier, as will be demonstrated below. 

Before proceeding, we discuss why this probabilistic ‘attack-unit-formation’ process 

may indeed mimic certain aspects of guerilla warfare. One such aspect is the effect of the 

arrival of opposing troops in the area. Imagine that at a given timestep and with a given 

probability ν, the opposing army arrives in the vicinity of a given attack unit of attack 

strength  si. If the overall conflict is such that the opposing army has the 

guerrillas/insurgents on the run, then this might suggest to the members of the insurgent 

attack unit that they should separate and move away from the area. However, if the state of 

the conflict is such that the guerilla/insurgent force feels powerful, they are unlikely to just 

 

26

disband and run if they have a significant attack strength. Instead they will possibly stand 

their ground and fight. Hence their probability of fragmentation is likely to be a decreasing 

function of their attack strength. By contrast, with probability  1−ν(
) , no opposing troops 
arrive in the vicinity of the attack unit. With probability  f si[ ] ( f s j[ ]) the attack unit i  ( j ) 
decide to join forces. Thus, the two attack units will coalesce with probability f si[ ]f sj[ ]. 

Again, this need for coalescing is likely to be less if the two attack units involved already 

feel powerful. Hence we would expect the probability of coalescence of the two attack units 

to be a decreasing function of their attack strengths. It is therefore quite plausible that -- 

depending on the state of the war from the insurgent force’s perspective -- the probabilities 
of fragmentation and coalescence should depend on  f si[ ] ( f s j[ ]), i.e. they depend on the 

attack strengths of the attack units involved.

summation simply gives a constant, and thus for small ν the dominant dependence on the 

attack strength  s is  ns ~ s− 5 2−δ

(

) and hence equivalently  ns ~ s− 2.5−δ

(

).   

Most importantly, we can see that by decreasing δ from  0.7 → 0 (i.e. by 

increasing the relative fragmentation/coalescence rates of larger attack units) we span 

the entire spectrum of power-law exponents observed in the Iraq war from the initial 

value of 1.8, up to the current tendency towards 2.5. This effect of decreasing δ from 

0.7 → 0 corresponds in our model to a relative increase in the tendency for larger 

attack units to either fragment or coalesce at each timestep. In other words, 

decreasing δ mimics the effect of decreasing the relative robustness or ‘lifetime’ of 

larger attack units.  

Going further, we note that these theoretical results are consistent with, and to some 

extent explain, the various power-law exponents found for: 

(1) Conventional wars. The corresponding power-law exponent 1.8 can now be interpreted 

through our generalized model with δ≈ 0.7, as a tendency toward building larger, robust 

attack units with a fixed attack strength as in a conventional army -- as opposed to attack 

units with rapidly fluctuating attack strengths as a result of frequent fragmentation and 

coalescence processes. There is also a tendency to form a distribution of attack units with a 

wide spectrum of attack strengths – this is again consistent with the composition of 

‘conventional’ armies from the past. 

(2) Terrorism in G7 countries. The corresponding power-law exponent 1.7 can be 

interpreted through our generalized model with δ≈ 0.8, as an even stronger tendency for 

robust units (e.g. terrorist cells) to form. There is also an increased tendency to form larger 

units – or rather, to operate as part of a large organization. 

 

29

(3) Terrorism in non-G7 countries. The corresponding power-law exponent 2.5 can be 

interpreted through our model with δ= 0, as a tendency toward more transient attack units 

(e.g. terrorist cells) whose attack strengths are continually evolving dynamically as a result 

of an on-going fragmentation and coalescence process. Unlike a conventional army, there 

will be a tendency to form smaller attack units rather than larger ones. 

Interestingly, we can now discuss the evolution of the wars in Colombia and Iraq in these 

terms: 

War in Colombia. At the beginning of the 1990’s, the power-law exponent was very high 

(3.5). Then over the following 15 years, it gradually lowered to the present value and 

appears to be tending toward 2.5. Using our model, the interpretation is that the war at the 

beginning of the 1990’s was such that the guerrillas favoured having small attack units. 

This is possibly because they lacked communications infrastructure, and/or did not feel any 

safety in larger numbers. The decrease toward the value 2.5, suggests that this has changed 

– probably because of increased infrastructure and communications, enabling attack units 

with a wide range of attack strengths to build up. 

War in Iraq. At the beginning of the war in 2002, the power-law exponent was quite low 

(1.8) and was essentially the same value as conventional wars. This is consistent with the 

war being fought by a conventional Iraqi army against the Coalition forces. There is then a 

break in this value after a few months (i.e. the war ended) and following this, the power-

law exponent gradually rises towards 2.5. This suggests that the insurgents have been 

increasingly favouring more temporary attack units, with an increasingly rapid 

fragmentation-coalescence process. This finding could be interpreted as being a result of

increased success by the Coalition Forces in terms of forcing the insurgents to fragment. On 

the other hand, it also means that the Iraq War has now moved to a value, and hence 

character, which is consistent with generic non-G7 terrorism.

We used two estimates for α (see Supplementary Information Table 1 in PART 2). We 

estimated 

1α  using α with  minx

 equal to the minimum value that satisfies the Kolmogorov 

statistic for the whole data set.  We estimated 

2α  using ordinary least-square regression 

analysis for all the values greater than  minx

. 

We established  minx

 as the minimum value of  x  where we could not reject the 

hypothesis that the data beyond  minx

 followed a power law using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov 

goodness of fit test at 95% confidence. 

In order to estimate the error of α, we used a minus-one jackknife resampling 

method.  We created the datasets obtained by removing one value from the original dataset.  

For each of these surrogates, we estimated α and  C .  We then measured the maximum and 

minimum deviation from the mean of the parameters α obtained from the diverse 

jackknife datasets. We established an interval equal to the maximum distance from the 

mean of the sample times 5.  Since this is not an analytical solution, we present the 

percentage of values that fall into that interval.  

The Evolution of α:  To test the robustness of our findings in Figure 2 of the paper, we 

have repeated the calculation of α for several different sizes of the time windows. We also 

tried varying the way in which these windows slide forward in time.  All these changes 

barely affected our results.  

As an example, in Part 2 of this document we have plotted the evolution of KI (deaths 

and injuries) for different time windows. For the Colombian data set we used a time 

 

36

window of 2,500 days moved every 1,855 days (see Supplementary Figure 2); then a 

moving time window of two years displaced every year (see Supplementary Figure 3), and 

finally a moving time window of two years, displaced every 50 days (Figure 1). For the 

Iraq data set we used a 365 day time window displaced every 258 days (Supplementary 

Figure 2), a 250 day interval displaced every 150 days (Supplementary Figure 3), and a 365 

day time window displaced every 30 days (Figure 1). As can be seen, our results are 

essentially unchanged by these variations. 

Further general comment on robustness testing:  As a further test of the robustness of 

the results obtained in our paper, and in particular our main findings in Figures 1 and 2 of 

the paper, we ran the following variations of our calculations. For Colombia we used just 

killings and just injuries, rather than killings plus injuries as presented in the paper.  For 

Iraq we used the maximum number of deaths rather than the minimum number of deaths as 

reported in the paper. These results are shown in Supplementary Figure 4. As can be seen, 

these variations do not affect our findings. This is reassuring, and is actually not too 

surprising since the power-law coefficient α provides a statistical measure of the structure 

of the events’ time-series, rather than the absolute number of killings and/or injuries. Hence 

the power-law coefficient α will be unaffected by any constant scale factors which are 

introduced as a result of a fixed ratio of injuries to killings.  

An additional, but perhaps even more important, advantage of focusing on α, 

concerns possible over- or under-reporting of war casualties. In particular, α is insensitive 

to systematic over-reporting or under-reporting of casualties. This is because any 

systematic multiplication of the raw numbers by some constant factor, has no affect on the 

α value which emerges from the log-log plot.

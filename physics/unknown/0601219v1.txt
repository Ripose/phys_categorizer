Abstract
—Results are presented from numerical modeling of the effect of the inhomogeneity of the ion back-
ground on the complicated spatiotemporal dynamics of an electron beam with a virtual cathode in plane geom-
etry. The possibility is demonstrated of increasing the generation frequency without changing the beam current.
The spatiotemporal structures that form in the beam and govern the complicated stochastic dynamics of the
nonuniform electron-plasma system under consideration are investigated by the methods of wavelet bicoher-
ence  and  by  analyzing  the  calculated  electron  trajectories  on  the  space–time  diagrams.

1.  INTRODUCTION

One  of  the  simplest  models  of  spatially  bounded
plasma systems is a diode gap penetrated by an electron
beam  against  a  charge-neutralizing  ion  background.
Such a model makes it possible to investigate both col-
lective  processes  in  plasmas  and  the  effect  of  the
boundary  conditions  that  give  rise  to  different  beam
instabilities  [1,  2].  In  the  theory  of  nonlinear  oscilla-
tions and waves, interest in spatially bounded plasma
systems  stems  from  the  possibility  of  using  them  to
model distributed active media with global couplings.
Here, we consider the model of a plane diode gap.
This  is  a  classical  model  for  studying  nonradiative
instabilities in electron-plasma systems [3, 4]. In 1944,
J. Pierce [5] investigated an electrostatic instability of a
high-current electron beam completely charge-neutral-
ized by the ion background in a system of ﬁnite length.
This  nonradiative  instability,  which  arises  from  the
ﬁnite length of the system, triggers space charge waves
whose amplitude grows in time, resulting in the forma-
tion of a virtual cathode, which gives rise to a backward
electron wave. The conditions for the onset of the insta-
bility are determined by the mode composition of the
plasma  oscillations  in  the  beam.  In  the  potential
approximation, the spatial spectrum of the one-dimen-
sional waves of the beam is described by the dispersion
relation [2]

velocity. With increasing beam current in the system, a
frequency range appears in which there exists a back-
ward  electron  wave,  i.e.,  a  wave  propagating  in  the
direction opposite to that of the beam. The condition for
the generation of a backward wave determines the con-
dition  for  the  onset  of  an  electrostatic  instability.  A
beam  with  a  virtual  cathode  can  be  interpreted  as  an
active resonant system [6] in which the initial perturba-
tion of the space charge density is ampliﬁed at a fre-
quency of about 

~2

Being simple, however, the system exhibits a wide
range  of  dynamic  regimes  in  the  nonlinear  stage  of
electrostatic instability, including the regime of deter-
ministic  chaos  [7–9].  In  some  papers  (see,  e.g.,  [10–
14]), the complicated dynamics of systems with a vir-
tual  cathode  is  attributed  to  the  formation  of  and  the
interaction between coherent spatiotemporal structures
in an electron beam.

Note  that  the  complicated  dynamics  of  electron-
plasma systems, as well as turbulent processes and the
formation  of  structures  in  them,  should  be  analyzed
with allowance for their nonlinearity. To study the latter
phenomenon, it is necessary to use special methods for
analyzing the formation of coherent structures and their
dynamics,  because  classical  linear  analytic  methods
(e.g., spectral analysis) fail to provide sufﬁcient infor-
mation on the processes occurring in a nonlinear sys-
tem. In this paper, we consider a technique for applying
one of the nonlinear methods of the analysis of compli-
cated  processes  in  distributed  systems,  namely,  bico-
herent  wavelet  transformation,  which  was  ﬁrst  pro-
posed by van Milligen

[15, 16].

The  wavelet  analysis,  which  has  been  elaborated
relatively recently, is a powerful tool for studying the
is  attracting
dynamics  of  nonlinear  systems.  It 
increased  attention  [17–20]  and,  in  particular,  has
begun to be used in studies of the complicated nonlin-
ear dynamics of plasmas [21–24]. The wavelet analysis
allows one to resolve the structural details of the signal
in time and to separate out the scales of the correspond-
ing  dynamic  processes  in  space.  Also,  the  wavelet
transformation  makes  it  possible  to  overcome  one  of
the drawbacks of applying the spectral analysis to tur-
bulence and chaos, namely, the expansion of the signal
in question in harmonic components. For the nonlinear
equations  describing  the  complicated  phenomena  in
distributed systems, this is not the case: they do not pos-
sess harmonic eigenmodes.

The  bispectra  (bicoherence  functions)  characterize
the phase relations (or phase coupling) between differ-
ent frequency components of the signal spectrum (see,
e.g., [25]). We can speak of the phase coupling when
the signal to be analyzed contains two components such

that the sum (or difference) of their frequencies

constant  during  a  certain  time  interval.  The  wavelet
bicoherence  analysis  makes  it  possible  to  resolve  the
spatiotemporal  data  into  coherent  structures,  i.e.,  to
determine  the  internal  beam  structure,  which  is  gov-
erned  by  the  phase  coupling  between  the  coherent
structures,  and  to  ﬁnd  out  how  the  beam  structure
evolves in time. That is why the wavelet bicoherence
analysis provides a useful tool for resolving and inves-
tigating coherent structures that form in spatially dis-
tributed systems.

Here, we present the results from numerical model-
ing of the effect of the inhomogeneity of the ion back-
ground on the complicated spatiotemporal dynamics of
an electron beam with an overcritical current in plane
geometry. We propose a method in which the wavelet
bicoherence analysis is used to resolve the spatiotem-
poral data into coherent structures. We then apply this
method to investigate the spatiotemporal structures that
form in a beam and govern the complicated stochastic
dynamics of the inhomogeneous electron-plasma sys-
tem under consideration.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
formulate  the  mathematical  model  and  describe  the
numerical simulation technique. In Section 3, we dis-
cuss the nonlinear dynamic of the system. An introduc-
tion to the wavelet bicoherence analysis is given in Sec-
tion  4,  which  summarizes  the  basic  notions  of  both
wavelet analysis and wavelet bicoherence analysis. In
Section  5, 
is
employed to describe the dynamics of spatial structures

The main parameters of the numerical scheme (see,
e.g., [28]), such as the number NC of mesh points in the
spatial grid and the number N0 of particles in each cell
of the grid in an unperturbed state, were chosen to be
NC = 800 and N0 = 24 (in which case the total number
of  particles  in  the  entire  computation  region  in  the
unperturbed state was N = 19200). The above parame-
ter  values  of  the  numerical  scheme  were  chosen  to
achieve the desired accuracy and reliability of a numer-
ical  analysis  of  the  complicated  nonlinear  processes
(including deterministic chaos) in the electron-plasma
system under investigation (see, e.g., [27, 29]).

The equations of motion were solved by a leap-frog
scheme [27, 30], and Poisson’s equation was integrated
by the error-correction method [31].

3.  NONLINEAR  DYNAMICS
OF  THE  SYSTEM

Here,  we  consider  the  nonlinear  dynamics  of  the
system  when  the  control  parameters—the  Pierce
parameter α and the parameters n and xi of the back-
ground  ion  layer—are  varied.  The  characteristic
dynamic regimes in the system are presented in Fig. 1,
which  shows  the  domains  corresponding  to  different
regimes  in  the  planes  (α, n)  and  (xi, n)  of  the  control
parameters.

The  dynamic  regimes  were  determined  from  the
oscillations of the potential φ(x, t) in the cross section
x =  xφ  =  0.25L.  In  order  to  reveal  the  oscillation
regimes,  the  times  evolutions  of  the  potential  φ(xφ,  t)
were  calculated  for  different  values  of  the  control
parameters. The calculated time realizations were used
to obtain the oscillation power spectra and reconstruct
the phase portrait of the oscillations. In turn, the phase
portraits  were  reconstructed  by  Takens’  method  [32],
which reduces to the construction of the phase vectors
of the form
{

where  φ(t)  are  the  oscillations  of  the  potential  in  the
cross  section  x = xφ,  T  is  the  time  delay,  and  d  is  the
dimensionality of embedding space (d = 2 corresponds
to the projection of an attractor onto a plane). Figure 2
illustrates  the  results  obtained  for  different  possible
dynamic regimes in the system.

An analysis of both the patterns of dynamic regimes
(Fig. 1) and the parameters of oscillations of the poten-
tial (Fig. 2) shows that, when the beam current α, the
background ion density n, and the position xi of the ion
layer are varied, the oscillatory dynamics of the system
undergoes complicated changes.

For low ion densities (n < 1.0–2.0), the oscillations
of the virtual cathode are regular (regime R in Fig. 1).
(This  regime  is  illustrated  by  Fig.  2a,  which  was
obtained for the control parameters α = 1.75π, n = 0.5,
and  xi = 0.05L.) An  increase  in  the  ion  density  in  the
layer  leads  to  the  onset  of  quasi-periodic  motion
(regime Q), illustrated by Fig. 2b (α = 1.34π, n = 1.0,
and xi = 0.05L). As the ion layer is displaced toward the
right boundary of the system, the domain of quasi-peri-
odic  dynamics  in  the  plane  of  the  control  parameters
broadens.

A further increase in n gives rise to different types of
stochastic dynamics of electron waves in a diode gap
with  an  inhomogeneous  ion  background.  Domain  C1
corresponds to the regime of weakly stochastic oscilla-
tions (see Fig. 2c; α = 2.86π, n = 2.0, and xi = 0.05L),
which arise as a result of the disruption of quasi-peri-
odic motion. In this case, the power spectrum is seen to

peak at two incommensurable base frequencies, which
are  “inherited”  from  the  quasi-periodic  regime.  The
attractor is now a narrow strip in phase space. As the
background ion density n increases even further, regime
C1  evolves  into  stochastic  regime  C2,  in  which  the
oscillations in the system are more irregular and, as a
consequence, the noisy pedestal in the power spectrum
is  higher. The  attractor  in  phase  space  is  a  wide  strip
(see Fig. 2d; α = 2.0π, n = 2.5, and xi = 0.05L). At xi <
0.2  and  for  a  narrow  range  of  values  of  the  control
parameters corresponding to regime C4 in Fig. 1, devel-
oped stochastic oscillations are observed, whose char-
acteristics are given in Fig. 2e (α = 2.0π, n = 3.5, and
xi = 0.05L). In the power spectrum, there is a high noisy
pedestal, decreasing gradually toward higher frequen-
cies, and there are peaks at the base frequencies and at
their satellite harmonics. The phase portrait of oscilla-
tions is uniform and is seen to be very noisy.

In order to quantitatively analyze the extent to which
the stochastic regimes differ from each other, we deter-
mined  the  correlation  dimensionality  D  of  stochastic
attractors  using  the  algorithm  developed  by  Grass-
berger and Procaccia [33] (see also [34]). The correla-
tion dimensionality D of an attractor is a function of the
observation scale length ε:

was reconstructed by Takens’ method). In simulations,
the  number  of  points  in  a  time  realization  was  N  =
200000 and the number of reduction points was M =
10000.  In  this  case,  the  correlation  dimensionality  is
also a function of the dimensionality d of embedding
space in which the phase vector x is reconstructed [see
formula (7)].

Figure 3 shows how the correlation dimensionality
of  an  attractor  depends  on  the  dimensionality  d  of
embedding space in different characteristic oscillation
regimes in the system under investigation. Note that, in
all  regimes,  the  dimensionality  of  the  attractors  satu-
rates  as  the  dimensionality  d  of  embedding  space
increases. This indicates that stochastic processes in a
diode gap with an overcritical current and an inhomo-
geneous  ion  background  are  of  a  dynamic  nature,
because,  in  the  case  of  noisy  oscillations  (including
those introduced by numerical errors), the dimensional-
ity  D  has  a  tendency  to  increase  in  proportion  to  the
dimensionality d of embedding space [35, 36].

In  the  regime  of  weakly  stochastic  oscillations
(regime C1), the dimensionality of the attractor of sto-
chastic  oscillations,  which  is  a  narrow  strip  in  phase
space,  is  equal  to  DC1  =1.04  ±  0.01.  We  see  that  the
dimensionality  is  fractional,  which  is  typical  of
dynamic chaos. The small value of the dimensionality
in regime C1 indicates that the attractor in phase space
is  a  very  narrow  strip,  whose  dimensionality  differs
insigniﬁcantly from the dimensionality DR = 1.0 of the
attractor of regular oscillations (limiting cycle), DC1 –
DR = 0.04. However, as the oscillations become more
irregular (which corresponds to a transition to stochas-
tic  regime  C2),  the  dimensionality  of  the  stochastic
attractor increases up to DC2 = 1.62 ± 0.01. This indi-
cates that the oscillations are of a very complex nature:
the attractor is now a wide strip in phase space, DC2 –
DR = 0.62. In the regime of developed stochastic oscil-
lations (regime C4), the dimensionality of the stochas-
tic attractor is equal to DC4 = 3.12 ± 0.02, which is much
larger than that in the preceding regimes.

In the plane of control parameters, we can also dis-
tinguish a “beak,” which is denoted by F and in which
the oscillation frequency in an electron beam increases
sharply. The corresponding oscillation regime is illus-
trated by Fig. 2f (α = 1.75π, n = 3.5, and xi = 0.05L),
which  was  obtained  for  the  same  beam  current  as  in
Fig. 2a, but for a substantially denser ion layer. A com-
parison of the power spectra in these two ﬁgures shows
that the base generation frequency increases by a factor
of ~2.

The dependence of the base frequency in the oscil-
lation spectrum on both the beam current and the ion
density  in  the  layer,  calculated  at  xi /L  =  0.05,  is  pre-
sented in Fig. 4.

where  M  is  the  number  of  reduction  points,  N  is  the
number of points in a time realization, H is the Heavi-
side function, and x is the state vector in phase space (it

From Fig. 4a, which shows the dependence of the
base frequency on the Pierce parameter (the beam cur-
rent) at different densities n, we can see that, for low ion

densities in the layer (n = 0.5, curve 1), the frequency is
a linear function of α. This result is quite natural: in a
diode  gap  with  a  homogeneous  ion  background,  the
oscillation frequency f of the virtual cathode is deter-
mined  by  the  Langmuir  frequency  ω
p  of  the  electron
p/π (see, e.g., [37–39]). From deﬁnition (2)
beam, f ≈ ω
of the Pierce parameter, it is clear that, for low ion den-
sities  in  the  layer,  the  oscillation  frequency  is  f  ~  α,
which agrees with the results of our numerical experi-
ments. As the ion density increases (n = 2.5, curve 2),
the dependence f(α) turns from being linear; moreover,
the  frequency
with 
becomes  progressively  lower  than  that  in  the  case  of
low ion densities in the layer (curve 2 deviates gradu-
ally  downward  from  curve  1).  As  the  ion  density
increases  further,  the  situation  changes  radically  (n  =
3.5, curve 3). For α < 2.1π, the oscillation frequency in
the beam at high ion densities in the layer is substan-
tially higher than at low values of n. Note that, at α ~
2.1π, the oscillation frequency first decreases and then
increases abruptly to f ≈ 6 GHz. For even higher beam
currents (larger α values) and for high n values, the base
oscillation frequency in the spectrum decreases sharply.
This is also illustrated in Fig. 4b, which displays the
dependence f(n) for different beam currents (different
α  values)  from  domain  F  in  the  pattern  of  regimes
shown in Fig. 1a. From Fig. 4b, we can see that, as the
density n reaches a certain critical value ncr1, the base
increases
frequency 
abruptly by a factor of ~2. The higher the beam current,
the higher is the critical density ncr1. This is distinctly
seen from a comparison of the curves calculated for dif-
ferent values of the Pierce parameter α.

the  oscillation  spectrum 

in 

As the ion density n in the layer increases further,
the frequency f(n) ﬁrst somewhat decreases, reaching
its minimum values, and then increases in a jumplike
manner. In this case, the frequency is higher than the
oscillation frequency for n (cid:2) ncr1. For even higher ion
densities  (ncr2  >  ncr1),  the  oscillation  frequency  in  an
electron beam decreases sharply. In contrast to ncr1, the
critical  density  ncr2  decreases  with  increasing  Pierce
parameter;  in  other  words,  as  the  beam  current
increases, the region in which the oscillation frequency
in  an  electron  beam  with  a  virtual  cathode  increases
becomes narrower and, simultaneously, the oscillation
frequency at ion densities in the range n ∈ (ncr1, ncr2)
increases.

Note also that, in domain C4 of the control parame-
ters, the most intense peak in the oscillation spectrum
occurs at the base oscillation frequency in regime F.

For very high ion densities in a layer located close to
the  injection  plane  for  an  electron  beam,  the  oscilla-
tions excited in the system are highly irregular (regime
C3): there is no base frequency and the spectral power
decreases sharply toward higher frequencies (Fig. 2g;
α = 2.4π, n = 5.0, and xi = 0.05L). In this case, the phase
portrait  of  oscillations  is  uniform,  and,  as  the  dimen-

sionality of the attractor saturates at DC3 = 2.43 ± 0.02
(Fig. 3).

However,  for  high  ion  densities  (n  >  3)  in  a  layer
located  far  from  the  injection  plane  for  an  electron
beam  (xi /L  >  0.2),  the  system  exhibits  far  simpler
dynamics  near  the  injection  plane  (Fig.  2h;  α = 3.0π,
n =  4.5,  and  xi  =  0.25L).  The  phase  portrait  and  the
shape of the power spectrum are seen to be similar to
those in regime C2 (Fig. 2d); this circumstance allows
the  observed  dynamic  regime  to  be  classiﬁed  as  C2
regime.

Let us consider the causes of such complicated tran-
sitions between different oscillation regimes as the con-
trol  parameters  of  the  system—the  beam  current  and
the  inhomogeneity  of  the  background  ion  layer—are
varied. Following papers [10, 11, 13, 14], which have
been cited in the Introduction, we can suggest that the
above  behavior  of  the  system  is  governed  by  the  dis-
tinctive  features  of  the  dynamics  and  interaction  of
coherent structures that form in the system. In order to

examine the processes of the formation and interaction
of coherent structures in an electron beam, we turn to
the wavelet bicoherence analysis.

The  bicoherent  wavelet  transformation  provides  a
tool for calculating the wavelet bispectrum and is a gen-
eralization of the wavelet transformation. The normal-
ized bispectrum (bicoherence) characterizes the phase
relations (phase coupling) between different frequency
components  of  the  signal  spectrum.  It  is  possible  to
speak of the phase coupling if the signal to be analyzed
contains two components such that the sum (or differ-
ence)  of  their  frequencies  ω
2  and  the  sum  of
their  phases  φ
2  both  remain  constant  during  a
certain time interval. Bicoherence is a quantitative mea-
sure of this phase coupling. The value of bicoherence is
a function of the frequencies ω
2 and should be
close to unity if the signal to be analyzed contains three
components  whose  frequencies  ω
2,  and  ω  and
phases satisfy the relationships

(15)

If relationships (15) fail to hold, bicoherence between

to zero.

The reason for this is that, in determining the Fou-
rier  or  the  wavelet  spectrum  at  any  time,  the  process
under analysis is regarded as a superposition of statisti-
cally  uncorrelated  processes  occurring  on  different
time scales and an estimate is made of how the power is
distributed  between  these  scales.  In  this  case,  the
dynamics of the process is described in terms of only
the  phase  relations
linear  mechanisms,  because 
between  different  frequency  components  of  the  spec-
trum are ignored. In fact, we can say that the Fourier or
the  wavelet  spectrum  contains  enough  information  to
provide a complete statistical description of a random
Gaussian process with a known mean value. However,
when the signal to be analyzed is generated by a non-
linear  dynamic  system  and,  accordingly,  is  a  compli-
cated superposition of different frequency harmonics at
any  time,  the  information  contained  in  the  Fourier  or
the wavelet spectrum is insufﬁcient to provide a com-
plete  description  of  the  process.  It  can  thus  be  sug-
gested that the phase coupling appears between some of
the  frequency  components  of  the  signal.  Information
concerning  the  nonlinearities  makes  it  possible  to
obtain the higher order spectra, in particular, the third-
order spectrum, or bispectrum. Extending the bispectral
analysis to include the wavelet transformation makes it
possible  to  analyze  essentially  nonlinear  phenomena
(such as the temporal dynamics of the phase coupling
between  different  signal  components)  and  to  resolve
coherent structures in spatiotemporal data.

By analogy with the Fourier bispectrum [25, 40], the

wavelet mutual bispectrum can be deﬁned as [16]

is  the  rule  for  summing  the  frequencies  and  the  fre-
s = 2π/s corresponds to the time scale s of the
quency ω
wavelet transformation.

The wavelet mutual bispectrum is a measure of the
phase coupling (over the time interval T) between the
components  of  the  wavelet  spectrum  W  of  the  signal
g(t) on scales s1 and s2 and the component of the same
spectrum of the signal h(t) on scale s. Accordingly, the
wavelet  mutual  bispectrum  can  be  interpreted  as  the
phase  coupling  between  waves  (wavelets)  whose  fre-
quencies satisfy the second of conditions (17).

For ease of analysis, it is convenient to use not only
mutual  bispectrum  (16)  but  also  the  wavelet  mutual
bicoherence,  which  is  deﬁned  to  be  the  normalized
wavelet mutual bispectrum:

(18)

According to this deﬁnition, the values of the mutual
bicoherence lie in the unit segment [0, 1].

An important characteristic of the bicoherent wave-
let transformation is the summed bicoherence, which is

to consider Morlet’s wavelet with ω

the Morlet’s wavelet is well localized in both coordi-
nate  and  frequency  spaces;  moreover,  the  larger  the
parameter ω
0, the higher is the resolution in frequency
space and the worse is the localization in time. In fact,
Morlet’s wavelet is a sinusoidal function modulated by
the  Gaussian  function  (see  Fig.  5,  which  shows  the
shapes of Morlet’s wavelet and its Fourier transform).
It is easy to see that there is a direct analogy between
the scales s (or the corresponding frequencies ω
s) of the

5.  COHERENT  STRUCTURES

In  order  to  analyze  the  processes  occurring  in  an
electron beam with an overcritical current by the meth-
ods  of  wavelet  bicoherence,  we  investigate  the  spa-
tiotemporal data on different characteristic regimes of
oscillations of the potential ϕ(x, t) of the space charge
ﬁeld in a diode gap.

We  start  by  considering  the  simplest  case—the
regime  of  regular  oscillations,  which  occurs  at  low
beam currents α against a slightly inhomogeneous ion
background (see domain R in Fig. 1). Figure 6a shows
the  corresponding  spatiotemporal  distribution  of  the
potential φ(x, t) for the parameter values α = 1.54π, n =
0.5, and xi = 0.05. We can see that, in all cross sections
of the diode gap, there are oscillations at the base fre-
quency f0 = 0.98 GHz.

Let us determine total bicoherence (20) of the data
on oscillations of the potential φ(x, t) and of the har-
monic signal whose frequency corresponds to the base
frequency f0 in the power spectrum of oscillations of the

potential.  In  other  words,  we  choose  the  signal
asin2πf0t as the signal h(t) in relationship (20), and we
take the oscillations of φ(xfix, t) at a certain ﬁxed spatial
point x = xfix as the signal g(t). In calculations, as the
mother  wavelet  function,  we  used  Morlet’s  wavelet,
which  provides  an  easy  interpretation  of  the  results
obtained  (see  the  discussion  above).  Figure  7a  shows
the calculated coordinate dependence of the total bico-
herence. The  function  b(x)  is  seen  to  have  one  maxi-
mum, which occurs near the injection plane. This indi-
cates  that  the  highest  possible  bicoherence  (i.e.,  the
strongest phase coupling between the oscillations of the
potential and the dynamics of the process on the main
time scale) corresponds to the oscillations of the poten-
tial in the region x/L ≈ 0.1. We thus can conclude that
the  main  spatiotemporal  structure,  which  determines
the basic time and spatial scales of the dynamics of the
system  under  investigation,  is  localized  in  the  region
x/L ~ 0.1.

Now, we calculate the summed wavelet bispectrum
BΣ( f ) [see relationship (21)] of the spatiotemporal data

on oscillations of the potential in a diode gap. The oscil-
lations of the potential φ(x, t) in the cross section x/L =
0.1, in which the total bicoherence of the process is the
highest, can be chosen as the signal h(t), and the oscil-
lations of φ(x, t) at different cross sections of the diode
gap can be chosen as the signal g(t). With these choices,
it is possible to reveal the spatial regions of the strong
phase  coupling  between  time  oscillations,  i.e.,  to
resolve the coherent structures that form in the system
and to determine their spatial localization.

The  results  of  calculating  the  summed  wavelet
bispectrum are illustrated in Fig. 7b, which shows the
relief of the quantity BΣ on the coordinate plane (x, f ),
where  x  is  the  coordinate  of  the  cross  section  with
respect to which the bicoherence is calculated and the
symbol f denotes the frequencies for which the summed
bicoherence is determined. We can see that, in the dis-
tribution of the summed bicoherence BΣ(x, f ), there is a
pronounced  localized  region  where  the  wavelet  bico-
herence  increases  sharply,  namely,  the  region  x/L  ~
0.05–0.2 and f ~ 0.8–1.2 GHz in the coordinate plane
(x,  f ).  This  is  the  region  of  a  single  spatiotemporal
structure in the beam. The structure is located near the
injection plane (is spatially bounded by x/L < 0.2) and
its characteristic time scale is about T = 1/ f ~ 1 ns. Note
that  the  distribution  of  the  summed  bicoherence  has
another  peak  at  the  frequency  f  ~  3.8  GHz,  which  is
approximately three times lower in height than the peak
at the frequency f ~ 1.9 GHz. This second peak is asso-
ciated with the dynamics of the same coherent structure
and is determined by the quadratic nonlinearity of the
electron-plasma system, speciﬁcally, by the phase cou-
pling between the dynamic processes occurring on the
main time scale T and on the time scale T/2 of the sec-
ond harmonic.

As  the  ion  background  becomes  more  inhomoge-
neous  (as  the  density  n  of  the  ion  layer  becomes
higher),  the  generation  frequency  in  the  system
increases abruptly (domain F in Fig. 1). Let us analyze
the dynamics of the system in this regime by the meth-
ods  of  wavelet  bicoherence.  We  consider  the  oscilla-
tions of the potential φ(x, t) for the same beam current
(α = 1.54π) and the same position of the ion layer (xi =
0.05)  as  in  the  previous  case,  but  for  a  substantially
higher ion density (n = 3.75). Figure 8a shows the cor-
responding  coordinate  dependence  b(x)  of  the  total
bicoherence between the oscillations of the potential in
different cross sections x of the diode gap and the har-
monic signal at the fundamental generation frequency
f0 = 3.1 GHz, and Fig. 8b shows the distribution of the
summed bicoherence BΣ(x, f ).

From  Fig.  8a,  we  can  see  that  the  region  of  high
wavelet bicoherence is adjacent to the injection plane
x = 0. The distribution of the amplitudes of the coeffi-
cients  of  the  summed  wavelet  bispectrum  along  the
interaction space (Fig. 8b) shows that, as before, there
is only one coherent structure, which characterizes the
behavior of an electron beam in the system. However,

in the interaction space, the structure now forms near
the  injection  plane  of  the  diode  gap,  in  the  interval
x/L ∈ (0.0,  0.1).  The  characteristic  time  scale  of  this
dynamic structure (approximately equal to T ≈ 0.5 ns)
is about two times longer than that in the previous case
of a low ion density in the layer. As in the previous case,
the temporal dynamics of the second harmonic of the
base frequency is very pronounced, indicating that the
oscillations are highly nonlinear.

Hence, in the case under consideration, an increase
in the degree of inhomogeneity of the system changes
the conditions for the formation of the coherent struc-
ture governing the dynamics of an electron beam in the
system.  As  a  result  of  such  a  reconﬁguration  of  the
internal structure of the beam, the characteristic spatial
scale  Λ
F  of  the  dynamics  of  the  single  structure  that
forms  in  the  system  changes:  it  becomes  about  two
times shorter than the spatial scale Λ
R of the coherent
structure in the regime of regular oscillations.

It is well known [42] that, for systems with a virtual
cathode,  the  mean  transit  time  τ

In the case at hand, the transit times in regimes F and R
can be estimated as τ

tively.  These  estimates  show  that  the  oscillation  fre-
quency fF in the F regime in a diode with a highly inho-
mogeneous ion background is related to the generation
frequency fR in a diode with a slightly inhomogeneous
background  by  fF  ≈  2fR,  which  is  conﬁrmed  by  the
results of our numerical modeling.

Now, we will analyze the regimes of developed sto-

chastic oscillations in the system.

We start by investigating the regime that arises at a
high beam current α in a diode gap with a highly inho-
mogeneous background ion density n and with an ion
layer  adjacent  to  the  injection  plane  (domain  C3  in
Fig. 1). We consider the spatiotemporal oscillations of
the potential of the space charge ﬁeld for the following
values of the control parameters: α = 2.125π, n = 4.0,
and xi = 0.05. The relevant distribution of the potential
φ(x, t) is shown in Fig. 6b. Note that, in this regime, the
spectral composition of the oscillations of the potential

in different cross sections of the diode remains essen-
tially the same.

Figure  9  illustrates  the  results  of  calculating  the
coordinate dependence of the total bicoherence b(x) of
oscillations of the potential and the distribution of the
summed bicoherence BΣ(x, f ). According to Fig. 9a, the
highest  total  bicoherence  corresponds  to  the  oscilla-
tions of the potential in the region x/L ≈ 0.25. This indi-
cates that, in the regime at hand, the main spatiotempo-
ral structure, which governs the characteristic dynamic
features of the system in question (ﬁrst of all, the fun-
damental spatial and time scales of oscillations in the
beam), is localized in the region x/L ~ 0.25.

Our calculations of the summed wavelet bispectrum
show that, in the distribution BΣ(x, f ), there are two pro-
nounced regions in the (x, f) plane where the wavelet
bicoherence increases sharply: the region x/L ~ 0.2–0.4
and f ~ 2.5 GHz and the region x/L ~ 0.1–0.2 and f ~
1.0 GHz.  In  each  of  these  regions  (where  the  coeffi-
cients  of  the  wavelet  bispectrum  are  large),  there  is
phase  coupling  between  oscillations  occurring  in  dif-
ferent cross section of the diode gap on the correspond-
ing time scales. Moreover, the value of bicoherence in
the  ﬁrst  region  is  considerably  larger  than  that  in  the
second region. Each of these regions in the (x, f) plane
can be characterized by its own coherent structure; the
behavior  of  each  of  these  structures  determines  the
dynamics of an electron beam.

From  Fig.  9b,  we  can  clearly  see  that  one  of  the
structures (speciﬁcally, the basic structure, which was
determined  from  the  calculations  of  the  total  wavelet
bicoherence) occupies a larger region in the interaction
space and has a shorter time scale, T1 ≈ 0.4 ns. The sec-
ondary  structure  has  a  shorter  spatial  scale  and  lies
between the injection plane and the basic structure. The
time  scale  of  the  secondary  structure,  T2  ≈  1.0  ns,  is
much longer than that of the basic structure. In this sys-
tem,  the  coupling  between  these  structures,  whose
dynamics  is  characterized  by  different  time  scales,  is
supposedly governed by the features of the complicated
stochastic dynamics of an electron beam. Thus, we can
say  that,  when  the  secondary  structure  (whose  time
scale T2 is substantially longer than the scale T1) inter-
acts with the basic structure, it plays the role of a dis-
tributed  feedback,  which  exerts  an  inﬂuence  on  the
dynamics of an electron beam. As a result, oscillations
in an electron beam become stochastic: in the case at
hand, the stochastic dynamics of the beam is associated
with the delayed (because of the different time scales)
complicated  interactions  between  the  coherent  struc-
tures forming in the system.

Now,  we  consider  a  regime  arising  in  a  system  in
which a high density (n = 4.5) ion layer lies far from the
injection  plane  (xi /L  =  0.25).  In  this  case,  the  Pierce
parameter is equal to α = 3.0π. The Fourier spectrum
and the phase portrait of oscillations in the cross section
x/L = 0.25 of the diode gap correspond to regime C2
(see  Fig.  1  and  Fig.  2h,  which  was  obtained  for  the

above  parameter  values  from  the  oscillations  of  the
potential in the cross section x/L = 0.25 of the interac-
tion space).

In contrast to the previous cases, the space charge
ﬁeld  exhibits  radically  different  temporal  behavior  in
different  cross  sections  of  the  diode  gap.  Thus,  the
spectral content of the oscillations changes both quali-
tatively and quantitatively along the interaction space.
This is illustrated in Fig. 10, which shows the Fourier
power  spectra  of  the  potential  φ  in  the  cross  sections
x/L = 0.05 (Fig. 10a) and x/L = 0.45 (Fig. 10b) of the
diode gap. The spectra are plotted on a non-logarithmic
scale. Near the injection plane, the oscillations of the
potential are weakly stochastic; in the power spectrum,
a  sharp  peak  at  the  base  generation  frequency  f0  =
2.24 GHz in the diode gap and a lower peak at the sec-
ond  harmonic  2f0  of  the  base  frequency  are  observed
against a low, poorly developed, noisy pedestal. The sit-
uation  changes  when  moving  along  the  interaction
space toward the exit grid of the system. In the power
spectrum,  the  noisy  pedestal,  which  decreases  slowly
with increasing frequency, becomes higher. In the low-
frequency spectral range (f < f0), spectral components
appear whose energy exceeds the energy of oscillations
at the frequency f0, which is also present in the spec-
trum of oscillations of the potential in the central part of
the  interaction  space.  Thus,  the  amplitude  of  oscilla-
tions at the frequency f1, predominating in the low-fre-
quency  spectral  range  (Fig.  10b),  is  larger  than  the
oscillation amplitude at the frequency f0 by a factor of
1.57.

We can suppose that such a change in the behavior
of  the  system,  namely,  the  generation  of  well-devel-
oped stochastic oscillations in the interaction space, is

associated  with  the  qualitative  reconﬁguration  of  the
internal structure of an electron beam.

Let us consider the spatial dynamics of the total b(x)
between the oscillations of the ﬁeld potential φ(x, t) and
the harmonic signal. Speciﬁcally, we are interested in
harmonic signals whose frequencies correspond to the
characteristic  frequencies  in  the  Fourier  power  spec-
trum of the oscillations in different cross sections of the
interaction  space.  These  are  the  frequency  f0,  which
corresponds  to  the  main  time  scale  near  the  injection
plane, and the frequency f1, which determines the char-
acteristic  time  scale  of  the  dynamics  of  an  electron
beam in the central part of the interaction space.

The  results  of  the  relevant  calculations  are  illus-
trated in Fig. 11. We can see that the proﬁles of the total

wavelet bicoherence b(x) calculated for harmonic sig-
nals  at  frequencies  corresponding  to  different  charac-
teristic time scales of oscillations in the system are rad-
ically different.

The  proﬁle  of  the  total  bicoherence  between  the
oscillations of the potential and the harmonic process at
the  frequency  f0  along  the  interaction  space  (Fig.  11,
curve  1)  shows  that  the  phase  coupling  between  the
oscillations  of  the  potential  and  the  dynamics  of  the
time scale T0 = 1/ f0 is the strongest in the region x/L <
0.1. This region can be identiﬁed with the spatiotempo-
ral  structure  that  forms  near  the  injection  plane  and
whose dynamics results in the appearance of a peak in
the  power  spectrum  at  the  fundamental  frequency  f0.
Over  the  remaining  part  of  the  interaction  space,  the
total bicoherence between the oscillations of the poten-
tial and the harmonic signal at the frequency f0 is low,
thereby indicating that the phase coupling between the
dynamics of this coherent structure and the oscillations
is weak.

The situation with the proﬁle of the total bicoherence
b(x)  between  the  oscillations  of  the  potential  and  the
harmonic process at the frequency f1 (Fig. 11, curve 2)
is analogous to that just described. In this case, the total
bicoherence is maximum in the region x ∈ (0.3L, 0.6L).
This region can be related to another coherent structure
that forms in the system and whose characteristic time
scale is T1 = 1/ f1. Note that, in this case, the total bico-
herence in the region where the ﬁrst coherent structure
forms  is  fairly  large.  This  indicates  that  the  second
coherent  structure  has  a  fairly  strong  impact  on  the
dynamics  of  the  ﬁrst  structure,  but,  as  was  shown
above, the ﬁrst structure does not affect the second.

Hence,  for  the  case  of  spatiotemporal  chaos  in  a
diode  gap  with  a  highly  inhomogeneous  ion  back-
ground, we succeeded in resolving the coherent struc-
tures that form in the system and revealing the charac-
teristic  features  of  the  interaction  between  them  by
exclusively analyzing the power spectrum P( f ) of the
oscillations  and  the  total  bicoherence  b  in  different
cross sections x/L of the interaction space. The method
proposed here for revealing the spatiotemporal coher-
ent structures is based on the fact that the total wavelet
bicoherence between the oscillations in the system and
the  harmonic  signal  at  a  frequency  corresponding  to
one or another characteristic time scale of the dynamics
of  the  system  varies  strongly  along  the  interaction
space.

For comparison, curve 3 in Fig. 11 shows the calcu-
lated proﬁle of the total wavelet bicoherence between
the oscillations of the potential and the harmonic signal
at a frequency other than the characteristic frequencies
in the power spectra that were obtained from the oscil-
lations of the potential in different cross sections of the
diode gap. To be speciﬁc, we chose the signal at the fre-
quency marked by f2 in the power spectrum shown in
Fig. 10b. From Fig. 11, we can see that the bicoherence
and, accordingly, the phase coupling between the oscil-

lations in the system and the dynamics of the chosen
time scale are both insigniﬁcant and vary only slightly
along the interaction space. If we choose another fre-
quency for analysis, we will be faced with a similar sit-
uation: although we will arrive at another value of bico-
herence, its proﬁle along the interaction space will be
qualitatively the same, b(x) ≈ const.

We thus can conclude that the wavelet bicoherence
analysis provides an easy and convenient way of reveal-
ing the basic time scales of the dynamics of the system
to be investigated. Also, in this approach, the methods
of  wavelet  bicoherence  turn  out  to  be  more  advanta-
geous than the Fourier methods for the analysis of the
spatiotemporal data. The reason for this is that, in the
approach proposed here, the use of the Fourier method
of inferring information on coherent structures from the
data  sets  requires  a  very  precise  determination  of  the
corresponding characteristic time scale, which, in addi-
tion, should remain constant in time. On the other hand,
in using the methods of wavelet bicoherence to deter-
mine phase coupling (15) between two oscillatory pro-
cesses, there is no need to determine the characteristic
time  scale  exactly  because  of  the  ﬁnite  width  of  the
mother  wavelet  (in  the  case  at  hand,  this  is  Morlet’s
wavelet, see Fig. 5) in frequency space. Thus, the time
scale of the process in question can vary in a fairly wide
range  (such  that,  on  each  of  the  observation  scale
lengths,  the  width  of  the  Fourier  spectrum  of  oscilla-
tions of the time scale is smaller than the width of the
Fourier transform of the basic wavelet function).

To  conclude  this  section,  we  describe  the  results
obtained  on  resolving  coherent  structures  in  the  spa-
tiotemporal  data.  We  illustrate  these  results  by  the
space–time  diagrams  of  the  dynamics  of  an  electron
beam in a diode gap with an inhomogeneous ion back-
ground. To do this, we investigate the space–time dia-
grams  of  an  electron  beam  for  the  cases  discussed
above.  These  diagrams  are  shown  in  Fig.  12.  Each
curve  in  the  diagrams  shows  the  trajectory  of  one
charged particle. The concentration of the trajectories
corresponds to bunches (electron structures) in an elec-
tron beam.

For the regime of regular oscillations (domain R in
Fig 1.), the space–time diagram of the beam (Fig. 12a)
coincides qualitatively with the “classical” diagram of
an  electron  beam  in  a  diode  gap  without  ion  back-
ground. We  can  clearly  see  the  formation  of  a  single
electron bunch—a virtual cathode—during each period
of oscillations of an electron beam. The virtual cathode
oscillates in both space and time and reﬂects most of
the  beam  electrons  back  to  the  injection  plane.  The
space charge density of the oscillating virtual cathode is
the highest in the region x/L ~ 0.1, in which the majority
of electrons come to a complete stop (v ≈ 0) and are
turned back. This behavior of the beam electrons agrees
with  the  results  of  the  wavelet  bicoherence  analysis,
according to which coherent structure should form in
the same region of the system (cf. Fig. 7).

Fig. 12. Space–time diagrams of an electron beam in different oscillation regimes.

As  the  degree  of  inhomogeneity  of  the  ion  back-
ground  increases  (as  the  density  n  of  the  ion  layer
becomes higher), the system passes over to regime F,
and the dynamics of an electron beam changes. This sit-
uation  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  12b.  One  can  see  that,  as
before, only one electron bunch (virtual cathode) forms

in the beam, but now it oscillates in space with a very
small amplitude. The wavelet bicoherence analysis of
the data illustrated in Fig. 8 shows that the characteris-
tic spatial scale of the coherent structure forming in this
regime is shorter than that in regime R. In fact, the peak
of  the  space-charge  density  is  closer  to  the  injection

KORONOVSKIŒ,  KHRAMOV

plane; as a result, the generation frequency in the sys-
tem increases sharply. Note that such a reconﬁguration
of the internal structure of an electron beam occurs in a
jumplike manner, and the generation frequency in the
diode gap also undergoes a jumplike increase (see Sec-
tion 3). In this case, electron oscillations in the beam
become stochastic (see the power spectrum of the oscil-
lations and their phase portrait in Fig. 2f) because of the
perturbing effect of metastable electrons that remain in
the region x/L ~ 0.2 of the interaction space during sev-
eral  characteristic  periods  of  oscillations  of  the  main
electron  structure  (virtual  cathode). When  these  elec-
trons  come  back  to  the  injection  plain,  they  start  to
inﬂuence  the  spatiotemporal  dynamics  of  the  virtual
cathode in the regime at hand.

The regime of developed stochastic oscillations is a
quite  different  situation.  In  regime  C3,  the  density  of
the  ion  layer,  which  neutralizes  the  electron  beam
charge, is so high that the main structure in the beam—
a virtual cathode reﬂecting the electrons—is “expelled”
from  the  layer  and  forms  at  its  boundary.  This  was
clearly demonstrated by the wavelet bicoherence anal-
ysis (Fig. 9), which made it possible to resolve the basic
coherent  structure  in  an  electron  beam  in  the  region
x/L ~  0.3.  Simultaneously,  a  potential  well  with  the
deepest  point  at  x/L ≈ 0.05  forms  between  the  virtual
cathode, which lies outside the ion layer, and the injec-
tion  plane.  Figure  6b  clearly  shows  that  the  potential
well traps the electrons that have been reﬂected from
the virtual cathode and approach the injection plane at
low velocities. The trapped electrons, bouncing in the
potential well, are readily seen in the space–time dia-
gram displayed in Fig. 12c. The spatiotemporal dynam-
ics in this regime is analogous to the dynamics of an
electron beam in an oscillator based on a triode-like vir-
tual cathode (see, e.g., [43]), in which case the potential
proﬁle is also double-humped. In a triode with a virtual
cathode, the electrons trapped in the potential well form
a self-similar vortex structure. Because of the interac-
tion  between  the  virtual  cathode  and  the  vortex,  the
electron dynamics in the beam becomes more compli-
cated, by analogy with the situation described in [43].
This vortex structure can be identiﬁed with the second
coherent structure, which was captured by processing
the  spatiotemporal  data  with  the  help  of  the  wavelet
bicoherence  analysis.  This  interpretation  is  supported
by  a  close  correlation  between  the  positions  of  these
two  structures  and  between  the  characteristic  spatial
and time scales of their dynamic behavior.

In regime C2 (when the ion layer is located far from
the injection plane), the electron beam dynamics is far
more complicated. From Fig. 12d, we can see the for-
mation of two electron bunches in the diode gap: a vir-
tual  cathode  near  the  injection  plane  and  a  bunch  of
electrons  oscillating  in  the  potential  well  associated
with the presence of a neutralizing ion layer with the
density n = 4.5 in the middle of the interaction space.
Comparing the space–time diagram in this ﬁgure with
Fig. 11, which shows the results of a calculation of the

total bicoherence for different characteristic time scales
of oscillations in the system, we can conclude that the
bicoherence analysis makes it possible to resolve both
of the characteristic coherent structures that form in the
beam.

6.  CONCLUSION

We have investigated the nonlinear dynamics of an
electron beam with an overcritical current in an inho-
mogeneous ion background. Diodes with an inhomoge-
neous  distribution  of  the  positive  neutralizing  back-
ground are of practical interest because they may serve
as  one  of  the  simplest  models  of  a  vircator  with  a
plasma anode [44]—a promising device of high-power
electronics.

Our  numerical  modeling  shows  that  such  a  diode
exhibits different oscillatory regimes, in particular, the
regime  of  developed  spatiotemporal  chaos.  We  have
found that, as the space charge density of the ion back-
ground increases above a certain critical value, which
depends  on  the  geometry  of  the  problem  and  on  the
electron beam current, the generation frequency in the
system  increases  abruptly.  This  effect  is  of  particular
interest, because it provides the possibility of increas-
ing the generation frequency of a device with a virtual
cathode without increasing the beam current.

Applying the wavelet bicoherence analysis to a set
of spatiotemporal data, we have resolved the coherent
structures that form in the distributed nonlinear system
under consideration, which is shown to exhibit different
regimes of complicated oscillatory dynamics, and have
estimated the characteristic time scales of the revealed
structures  and  their  spatial  localization.  The  results
obtained with the help of the wavelet bicoherence anal-
ysis agree well with the physical picture of the internal
dynamics of an electron beam with an overcritical cur-
rent in a diode gap. Thus, we have managed to identify
the coherent structures that form in the system with the
electron bunches in the beam.

In  summary,  we  can  say  with  certainty  that  the
wavelet  bicoherence  analysis  is  an  effective  tool  for
resolving  the  coherent  structures  that  govern  the
dynamics of spatially distributed electron-plasma sys-
tems in a state of developed chaos with electron turbu-
lence.

Long-range  beam-beam  interactions  (parasitic  cross-
ings) are one of the main luminosity performance limita-
+
tions for the Frascati e
 Φ-factory DAΦNE.  In particu-
lar,  the  parasitic  crossings  lead  to  a  substantial  lifetime
reduction of both beams in collision. This puts a limit on
the maximum storable current and, as a consequence, on
the achievable peak and integrated luminosity. In order to
alleviate the problem numerical and experimental studies
of  the  parasitic  crossings  compensation  with  current-
carrying  wires  have  been  performed  at  DAΦNE.  Two
such wires have been installed at both ends of the KLOE
interaction  region.  Switching  on  the  wires  in  agreement
with  the  numerical  predictions,  improvement  in  the
lifetime of the “weak” beam (positrons) has been obtained
at  the  maximum  current  of  the  “strong”  one  (electrons)
without  luminosity  loss.  In  this  paper  we  describe  the
parasitic  crossings  effects  in  DAΦNE,  summarize  the
results  of  numerical  simulations  on  their  compensation
with  the  wires  and  discuss  the  experimental  measure-
ments and observations.

INTRODUCTION

+
The  Frascati  Φ -factory  DAΦ NE  is  an  e

  collider
operating  at  the  energy  of  Φ-resonance  (1.02  GeV  c.m.)
[1].  Its  best  peak  luminosity  reached  so  far  is  1.5x1032
cm-2s-1  with  a  maximum  daily  integrated  luminosity  of
about 10 pb-1 [2].

In order to obtain such a high luminosity at low energy
high  current  bunched  beams  are  stored  in  each  collider
ring. Usually, the number of adjacent filled buckets is in
the  range  109÷111  out  of  120  available.  A  short  gap  is
needed  for  ion  clearing.  It’s  worth  reminding  that  in
DAΦNE  the  bunch  separation  of  2.7  ns  is  the  shortest
among all existing colliders and particle factories.

In  order  to  minimize  the  effect  of  parasitic  crossings
(PC)  of  the  closely  spaced  bunches  the  beams  collide
under  a  crossing  angle  in  the  range  10÷20  mrad.
However,  in  spite  of  the  crossing  angle,  the  long-range
beam-beam  interactions  (LRBB)  remain  one  of  the  most
severe limitations to the performance of DAΦNE in terms
of  luminosity.  In  fact  LRBB  interaction  leads  to  a
substantial lifetime reduction of both beams, limiting the
maximum  storable  currents  and,  as  a  consequence,  the
maximum achievable peak and integrated luminosity. The
latter is strongly influenced by the beam lifetime because
in  the  topping  up  regime  a  fraction  of  the  integrated
luminosity is lost during the time necessary to switch the
injection  system  from  from  one  beam  to  the  other.  The
problem of the LRBB interactions is expected to be even
more  pronounced  in  future  operation  for  the  FINUDA

experiment [3], because the crossing angle is intrinsically
lower.  The  PC  effects  are  foreseen  to  be  also  very
important for the DAΦNE upgrade options [4], where the
number of colliding bunches will be increased by means
of  higher  frequency  RF  cavities  making  the  bunch
separation even shorter than in the present situation.

Looking  for  a  compensation  scheme  to  reduce  the
impact  of  LRBB  interactions  we  decided  to  install  two
windings  (wires)  at  both  ends  of  the  KLOE  interaction
region  (IR).  This  approach  revises  an  idea  originally
proposed  by  J.P.Koutchouk  [5]  for  LHC,  and  recently
tested  during  single  beam  operation  on  SPS  [6,  7].
Simulations  using  LHC  compensation  devices  also
predicted a relevant dynamic aperture enlargement for the
Tevatron collider [8].

At DAΦNE we have performed an experimental study
of  the  LRBB  compensation  using  purposely  built  wires
obtaining  encouraging  results,  and  testing  for  the  very
first time the wire compensation scheme in collision.

In  this  paper  we  describe  our  experience  and  the

experimental results.

PARASITIC CROSSINGS IN DAΦNE
DAΦNE consists of two independent rings sharing two
interaction  regions:  IR1  and  IR2.  The  KLOE  detector  is
installed  in  IR1.  While  delivering  luminosity  to  KLOE
bunches  collide  with  a  crossing  angle  of  14.5  mrad,  and
are  vertically  separated  in  IR2  by  a  distance  larger  than
200  σy.  For  this  reason,  in  the  following  considerations
only LRBB interactions in IR1 will be taken into account.

The bunches experience 24 PCs in IR1, 12 before and
12  after  the  main  interaction  point  (IP),  until  they  are
separated by splitter magnets into two different rings.

Table 1 summarizes the main parameters for some PCs:
relative  position,  beta  functions,  phase  advances  with
respect to the IP and transverse separation in terms of σx,y.

There are indications that the LRBB interactions affect
the  beam  dynamics  in  DAΦNE:  in  fact,  the  PCs  induce
orbit distortion that can be satisfactory reproduced by the

machine  model,  based  on  the  MAD  [9]  code,  when  the
PCs are taken into account. MAD predictions agree with
the  orbit  distortion  obtained  from  the  beam-beam
simulation code Lifetrack [10], see Fig. 1

since  distances  between  the  beams  at  PC  locations  are
different  in  terms  of  the  horizontal  sigma  and  phase
advances  between  PCs  and  wires  are  not  completely
compensated  (see  Table  1).  Indeed,  the  numerical
simulations  did  not  show  improvements  in  luminosity.
However,  the  positive  effect  of  tails  reduction  and
corresponding  lifetime  increase  is  very  important,
because it leads to a larger integrated luminosity.

24  BBLR  interactions  for  the  positron  bunch  colliding
against 10 mA electron bunches.

Moreover,  the  lifetime  of  each  beam  starts  decreasing
during  injection  of  the  opposite  beam  and  remains  low
soon  after  injection.  Typically,  in  collision,  the  electron
beam  current  reaches  1.8÷2.2  A,  while  the  maximum
positron beams is 1.3÷1.4 A. Exceeding these values the
lifetime  of  the  beams  drops  down  to  700÷800  sec.
Presently  this  behaviour  is  considered  one  of  the  main
limitation of the collider performance.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
The “weak-strong” tracking code LIFETRAC was used
to  simulate  the  equilibrium  distribution  of   the  positron
(‘weak’)  beam.  The  main  sources  of  long  beam  tails  are
the 2 PCs nearest to the Main IP, but the other PCs also
make  some  contribution,  so  we  account  for  all  of  them.
The wires were simulated as additional PCs with variable
current (“wire-PC”), so that no special tracking algorithm
for  wires  was  used.  This  approach  is  justified  by  the
rather  large  values  of  the  β x,y  functions  at  the  wire
locations  (16.5  and  4  m  respectively),  much  larger  than
both  the  bunch  and  wire  length.  This  allows  simulating
the  interaction  with  the  wire  as  a  single  kick,  neglecting
the  effect  of  movement  of  the  "strong"  bunch:  the
longitudinal coordinate of collision point for the real PC
depends  on  the  particle's  longitudinal  coordinate,  while
the  wire  are  fixed,  but  for  large  betas  a  shift  of  few
millimeters  gives  actually  no  effect.  On  the  other  hand,
the  betas  are  small  enough  to  have  a  large  separation  in
units  of  the  transverse  beam  size  (≈20),  so  the  actual
“shape of wire” (i.e. density distribution inside the wire-
PC) does not matter: it works like a simple 1/r lens. Some
simulation results are shown in Fig. 2. The beam current
was  chosen  to  be  large  enough  to  have  long  beam  tails
due  to  PCs  (a),  then  the  wires  were  switched  on  and  the
tails reduced (b). When the wires are powered with wrong
polarity, the tails blow-up becomes even stronger (c).

As a matter of fact, the PCs compensation with a single
wire on each side of the interaction region is not perfect

WIRE DESIGN AND INSTALLATION
The  wires  have  been  built  and  installed  in  IR1  in
November  2005.  Each  device  is  made  of  two  coils  of
installed
rectangular  shape,  20  windings  each, 
symmetrically  with  respect  to  the  horizontal  plane,  see
Fig.  3.  Our  device  differs  from  the  LHC  one  for  several
aspects:  our  wires  are  installed  outside  the  vacuum
chamber exploiting a short section in IR1, just before the
splitters,  where  the  vacuum  pipes  are  separated  to  host
Lambertson  type  correctors  not  essential  for  operation
and  therefore  removed.  The  wires  carry  a  tunable  DC
current,  and  produce  a  stationary  magnetic  field  with  a
shape similar to the one created by the opposite beam.

(lower frames).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A  systematic  study  of  the  wires  in  collision  has  been

undertaken during the machine shifts in March 2006.

The  wires  were  powered  at  3.6  A  to  compensate  as
much as possible the beam lifetime of the positron beam
that, due to the limited maximum achievable current, can
be considered as the ‘weak’ one.

It  has  been  experimentally  verified  that  the  residual
orbit  distortions  with  maximum  deviations  of
+0.4 -0.5 mm  due  to  the  PCs  is  very  well  corrected  with
wire  currents  of  ≈1  A.  This  is  a  proof  that  the  wires
behave as correctors “in phase” with the PCs. It has been
also  measured  that  the  wires  introduce  some  betatron
tunes shifts which should be corrected.

The  residual  orbit  distortion  due  to  the  wires  at  3.6  A
was corrected by the ordinary dipole correctors, while the
tune  shifts  were  compensated  by  means  of  the
quadrupoles in a dispersion free straight section.

Several  luminosity  runs  have  been  compared  by
switching  the  wires  on  and  off  to  study  their  impact  on
the collisions. In the following the two most relevant sets
are presented taking into account 2 hours long runs. The
results in Fig. 4 show some clear evidences. Switching on
and  off  the  wires  we  obtain  the  same  luminosity  while
colliding the same beam currents. The positron lifetime is
on  average  higher  when  wires  are  on,  while  the  electron
one  is  almost  unaffected.  The  beam  blow-up  occurring
from  time  to  time  at  the  end  of  beam  injection,
corresponding  to  a  sharp  increase  in  the  beam  lifetime,
almost disappear.

A further aspect becomes evident when comparing, on
the same plot, the positron current and lifetime with and
without wires, see Fig. 5. The positron current starts from
the same value, then, in the case of wires off the current
decreases  with  a  higher  derivative  than  in  the  case  with
wires  on.  The  lifetime  exhibits  a  consistent  behavior,
being higher in the case when wires are on. In this way it

is possible to keep the same integrated luminosity inject-
ing the beam two times only instead of three in the same
time  integral,  or  to  increase  the  integrated  luminosity  by
the same factor keeping the same injection rate.

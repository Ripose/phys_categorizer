Abstract: We have observed for the first time a new photonic quantum ring emission of 
anti-whispering  gallery  modes  from  a  negative  mesa-type  toroid  cavity  due  to 
semiconductor photonic corrals. 
 
 

We  have  studied  a  photonic  quantum  ring  (PQR)  laser  with  naturally-formed  quantum  wire  anomalies 
such  as  micro-to-nano  ampere  thresholds  and  T  dependent  spectral  shifts,  exhibited  in  the 
circumferential mesa region of active quantum well planes sandwiched by top and bottom DBR stacks [1], 
whose modes are optically confined by total internal reflections (TIRs) in a toroidal Rayleigh-Fabry-Perot 
cavity  of  3  dimensional  whispering  gallery  modes  (WGM).    Fig.  1  shows  a  CCD  image  of  15 ㎛ PQR 
laser  with  a  10 ㎂ injection  current.  The      PQR  generation  is  assumed  to  be  associated  with  a  photonic 
quantum  corral  effect  (PQCE)  in  semiconductor  [2,  3],  and  its  hetero-spectral  (multiple  wavelength) 
radial emission characteristics are governed by an angular quantization rule [4].   

We  now  report  a  new  observation  of  anti-WGM  type  PQR  emission  from  recent  experiments  on  (1) 
hollow  PQRs  and  (2)  PQR  holes(or  negative-mesa):  (1)  For  the  hollow  PQRs(Figs.  2),  the  inner 
boundary(hole)  spectrum(curve  a)  was  taken  separately  from  the  outer  regular  PQR  spectrum(curve  b) 
with a tapered fiber probe of 2 ㎛ tip size. (2) Further, we also fabricated holes (or negative-mesas, Figs. 
3(a)) and a typical emission spectrum is shown in Figs. 3(b) with changing view angles. We know that the 
old  Rayleigh’s  WGM  theory  applies  only  to  the  ‘concave  surface’  TIR.  In  contrast,  the  present  hole 
emissions  surprisingly  arise  from  the  convex  surface,  defying  any  common  TIR  knowledge.  We  thus 
believe  a  PQR  type  hole  emission  is  generated  here  due  to  the  strong  the  PQCE  phenomenon,  also 
assisted by additional gain guiding thereof.  

 

 

We further fabricated an 8x8 PQR hole array in the same fashion. They exhibit fairly uniform emissions 
while the peak intensities gradually decrease as a function of distance from the p-electrode stripe. Present   
simple fabrication procedures with ease suggest an excellent potential application for high density optical 
interconnects as well.

FRAGMENTARY ELECTRODYNAMICS OF SOLITONS EMITTED BY

ATOMS

Sofia University, Faculty of Physics

Summary

In the recent years there was published some papers in which the photons are

represented as electromagnetic solitons [1,2,3]. All particles – solitons – represent

some electromagnetic field restricted in a very small volume, length, cross-section

and propagate in vacuum with light velocity in one and the same directions at a very

great unrestricted distances [3]. These  unordinary properties of the electromagnetic

field – soliton – require some more detailed investigations of the dynamics of

interactions of charged particles and electromagnetic fields.

In this paper I make an attempt to solve in part (fragmentary) some questions

about energy density of the soliton, electrodynamics of soliton and the simplest

hydrogen atom, the acceleration of a charged particle, the path of the electron wile it

changes its position, the emitted electromagnetic soliton energy and the electron in a

stationary state.  The descriptions are restricted only to the properties of the solitons

in paper [3] and to the hydrogen atom,  but I think that obtained results could be

applied to the more complicated systems.

Introduction.

As was shown in [3], the electromagnetic field of a single photon must be

concentrated in a very small volume, V. The relation between the maximal electric

field (E0) of a soliton and the frequency (w ) of a free photon is: E0
where  w

 is the frequency obtained from interference phenomena, de Broglie’s

2 = (8m0!/e2)w 3,

frequency; m0 and e are the mass and electric charge of the electron. The energy of

the photon is !w

 = E0

2V; volume V = (e2/8m0!w

s = E0
electromagnetic field of the soliton and the wave length (l ) of de Broglie are related:

 and the effective length (le) of the

. So, the electromagnetic field occupies only a small part of l

 and a very

small part of the photon wave package (wave function).

1. Consistence with Planck’s density of radiation.

In the Fig.1 schematically is presented a soliton with the above mentioned

properties. Se = e2/8m0cw

 is macroscopic cross-section of the soliton.

This confirms the assumption that in a larger volume in comparison with the real

volume of the electromagnetic field, the energy density (larger volume) appears to be

smaller [3]. The soliton energy density is consistent with energy density of Planck.

The only difference between (2) and (3) is that the soliton volume (V) is different

from the unit volume. One can calculate the average number ( 1 ) of photons for

which Planck’s energy density (2) is equal to the energy density of a soliton (3).

(5) is reciprocal to (3a). These results explain the first unsuccessful attempt to

describe the photoelectric effect within the framework of the electromagnetic wave

theory. It is clear that the electric field E does not change with time t and frequency

, as it was thought before, but the number of photons in unit volume remains

proportional to E2 . The soliton (particle) and the energy density is concentrated in a

very small volume. The frequency w

 is the frequency of de Broglie’s field D, like for

all particles. The amplitude D of the real field of de Broglie accounts for all

interference phenomena and for all particles.

As it is known from electrodynamics only when a charged particle is

accelerated it can emit an electromagnetic field. In the hydrogen atom of Bohr the

electron in a stationary state dose not emit the photons. The photon is emitted only

when the radial coordinates change. In this time the electron changes the velocity

passing from one upper excited state (k) to some lower state (n). If one know the time

of transition, then acceleration of electron could be found. Up to now this time of

transition is not known and something more, we accept that it is useless to think about

this time.

On the other hand, if the photon can be represented as an electromagnetic

particle – soliton – with a determined volume, length and cross-section [3], then
effective action time of the soliton depends of it de Broglie’s frequency (w ) as te =
1/2w

. It must be accepted that effective action time of a soliton electric field (emitted

from hydrogen) corresponds to the effective time of spontaneous transition in

hydrogen atom. One can find the acceleration of electron while the transition occur

and knowing this acceleration it is possible to obtain the energy of the soliton (the

energy of the emitted photon).

Acceleration. As was mentioned the effective time (te = 1/2w ) of the soliton

require a corresponding acceleration time of electron when the electron passes from

upper (k) to lower level (n) in hydrogen atom. On the Fig.2 schematically are shown

the velocities (Vk, Vn) and acceleration (a).

exactly known, but the effective time of velocity change is te = 1/2w .

4

The effective time of acceleration and the shape of acceleration curve must

correspond to the effective time of the soliton  and to the shape of electric field of the

soliton (Fig.1 and Fig.2). When the electron is in a stationary state (no acceleration)

the electric field of the soliton is zero [4,5]. Knowing the time (te) and the velocities

(Vk and Vn) we can obtain the effective acceleration (a) of the electron when passing

from upper level (k) to lower level (n). The corresponding velocities are:

Vk = e2/!k;     Vn = e2/!n

The effective time of acceleration correspond to the effective time of the

emitted electromagnetic soliton (te) and effective acceleration must be:

a = (Vn – Vk)/te = (e2/!)(1/n – 1/k)/te

Substituting (te = 1/2w ) we obtain:

a = 2w (Vn – Vk) = (2e2w

/!)(1/n – 1/k)

(8)

The effective way (path) of electron (Hnk) while changing it state is:

Hnk = (a/2)t 2

e  + Vkte

 

Substituting here (te), (8) and Vk from (6) , one can find the effective path:

Hnk = (e2w

/!)(1/n – 1/k)(1/4w 2) + e2/!k(1/2w )

Hnk = e2/!(1/2w )((1/2)(1/n – 1/k) + 1/k)

(10)

(cid:11)(cid:26)(cid:12)

(9)

Energy of the soliton. According to the electrodynamics when the energy is

emitted the average force (taking into account the force of reaction) is F = am0 . This

force is a result of the Coulomb field of hydrogen atom and the reaction of

electromagnetic field of the soliton. So, the energy (Enk) which the accelerated

electron emits can be found, substituting the necessary quantities in equation:

Enk = FHnk = am0Hnk

As it is seen, in this way obtained energy (accelerated electron), coincide

exactly with the results of Bohr and electromagnetic energy of the soliton, when it is

emitted from a hydrogen atom [4].

From classical electrodynamics we know that a free electromagnetic field is

proportional to the acceleration of charged particle, but the energy of the emitted field
is redistributed in whole space and diminish with distance (r) as 1/r2 . The field is

maximal at perpendicular direction to the acceleration vector and is delayed in time as

(t – r/c). Up to now it was not possible to calculate the effective acceleration of

electron in hydrogen atom because the time of velocity change was not accessible for

investigation. Even the questions “how long is this time”,  and “when the transition

occur” are forbidden [4,5]. Now, the properties of the soliton  determine this time and

the effective acceleration is calculated. The energy of the emitted soliton is exactly

equal to the energy losses in the hydrogen. Something more, all energy losses from

the atom can be transferred (in vacuum) at a very great unrestricted distance as an

electromagnetic particle – soliton.  This means that whole electromagnetic energy is

emitted in some well defined direction and the momentum of soliton is equal to the

momentum of atom, but in opposite direction, as predicted by Einstein [6,7].

These properties of the photon-soliton and the hydrogen atom are not trivial

and they must be examined in more details. If the solitons with these properties [3]

exist in the nature, then the transitions in hydrogen atoms must take a time te = 1/2w

and the atom in a stationary state must be comparatively stable. In the following

paragraphs  I describe the hydrogen atom as a solitary (single) quantum system

because every soliton must be emitted by only one solitary hydrogen atom.

3. “When the transitions occur?”

We must accept that the hydrogen atom emits a soliton only wile the electron

and proton change the velocities. (Remember that the proton and electron move about

the center of masses and change simultaneously its states). But why the electron

cannot be accelerated when moving in a stationary state?

Contemporary  quantum  physics  deals  with  statistical  ensembles  of  quantum

objects:  atoms,  nuclei,  photons,  electrons  and  other  particles.  The  Bohr’s  model

concern a solitary Hydrogen atom. This paper deals (also) with the single (separate)

quantum  object:  one  particle,  one  electron,  one  soliton,  one  single  hydrogen  atom,

one nucleus, the “solitary quantum system” (SQS). Some specific properties of a SQS

(hydrogen)  are  derived  on  the  basis  of  experimental  facts  and  the  theory  of

contemporary  quantum  physics  (QP).  Thus,  the  properties  of  a  solitary  hydrogen

atom do not contradict the results of QP, but allow us to think about and search for

unknown and unexpected applications of quantum physics.

Remember  that  all  quantum  laws  were  initially  derived  from  the  results  of

experiments  of  statistical  ensembles  of  quantum  systems.  Subsequently  these  laws

were applied to solitary quantum systems which are the elementary constituents of the

statistical ensemble. This is easy and trivial. Easy because it is not necessary to search

for other properties of the solitary object and trivial because this  transition  does  not

contradict the laws which govern an ensemble of identical objects (quantum systems,

QS).  For  a  statistical  ensemble  of  quantum  systems  the  introduction  of  probabilities

and  the  statistical  interpretation  of  results  are  inevitable,  but  it  is  not  sure  that  a

solitary  quantum  system  must  be  governed  by  the  same  principles.  To  be  more

specific, I can explain the above assertions with the help of an example:

7

The  law  of  radioactive  decay,  N=N0exp(-t/t ),  was  at  first  observed  experimentally

and  after  that  derived  from  statistical  considerations.  N  is  the  number  of  QS  which

have not decayed for the time t; N0 is the number of QS at the initial moment of time
(t  =  0)  and  t   is  the  mean  life  time  of  all  QS.  This  law  concerns  all  decays  of  any

excited states of nuclei, atoms, molecules and so on (except some deviations in very

short and very long times). It is easy to transfer this law from a statistical ensemble to

one solitary object by introducing the probability (W) that this object does not decay
for a time (t): W=N/N0= exp(-t/t ). But this probability is a trivial application of a law

which concerns only a statistical ensemble of quantum objects. This probability is not

a proof that a solitary object does not have another cause for decay.

In the paper [8] it was shown that in the case of waves on the surface of a liquid the

floating  classical  particles  which  pass  through  only  one  of  the  two  opened  slits  are

guided by the interfering surface waves in the same directions (angle  q ) as predicted

by quantum laws ‰

(q )‰ 2=max; (the directions ‰

(q )‰ 2=0 are not allowed.) This is

an  indirect  confirmation  of  de  Broglie's  ideas  that  wave  and  particle  exist

simultaneously  and  that  this  coexistence  is  real  [9].  Most  of  the  scientists  think  that

the field of de Broglie is not real and they accept the statistical interpretation of Born

[10].  One  of  the  most  often  stressed  disadvantages  of  the  model  of  Bohr  is  the

impossibility to determine (calculate) the probabilities of transition (intensities) of the

emitted hydrogen lines...

hydrogen atom.

4.  Return  to  the  real  unitary  field-particle  of  de  Broglie  and  to  Bohr's  model  of

Why  is  the  assumption  that  a  wave-particle  cannot  exist  simultaneously  more  real

than  de  Broglie's  assumption  that  they always  exist  simultaneously?.  The  results  of

this work will  show  there  is  simultaneous  existence  of  de  Broglie's  field  and  Bohr's

atom  ...  and  that  (for  one  atom)  no  statistical  interpretation  is  necessary.  De

Broglie's waves in the hydrogen atoms are such that in the stationary state the mass of

the electron (m0), its velocity Vn , and average radius rn are related with the principal

quantum number (n= 1,2,3....) according to:

and the field-particle (electron) is in a potential well which keeps the electron in orbit

De  Broglie's  unitary  "wave-particle"  is  in  a  stationary  ("steady")  state  which  never

changes.  The  "wave-particle"  electron  is  bound  together  with  the  "wave-particle"

proton  by  electromagnetic  forces  and  de  Broglie’s  real  field.  They  interfere  and

remain in their potential well (position) forever, like classical particles on the surface

of a liquid [8]. The field of de Broglie is real and strong so that the electromagnetic

forces  cannot  destroy  this  interference  and  field-particle  (electron)  cannot  be

accelerated. To explain the decay of a stationary state it is necessary to assume some

infinitely small "external perturbation" which would disturb the exact equalities (14)

and  (15)  and  (after  some  time  of  destructive  interference)  permit  the  transition  to

lower states (acceleration of electron). Only the state n=1 cannot be disturbed by an

"infinitely  small  perturbation"  because  the  field-particle  cannot  be  destroyed  (n
cannot be smaller than 1 and 2p

1). In this case only if the perturbation energy is

r1=l

sufficiently great, can the electron make a transition from ground to upper levels by

absorption, [8]).

I suppose that energetically excited the electron can randomly occur  at  any  distance

(rni)  around  the  exact  radius  of  the  stationary  orbit  (
between  the  trajectory  of  the  electron  (2p rni)  and  nl

n  can  be  very  small,  yet  -

destructive interference leads (after some time) to a transition to lower states. Imagine

the  "wave-particle"  electron  self-interferes  as  long  as  the  minima  of  the  wave

coincides  with  the  maxima  of  the  preceding  waves  so  that  the  amplitude  (D)  of  the

interfering electron-wave becomes

. A transition (acceleration) occurs and

state  would  be  established  and  without  external  perturbation  this  state  could  not  be

changed. So, it is evident that the wave-particle electron can be excited so, as to occur

at all possible distances (r) from the proton.

5. Own lifetime of a single hydrogen atom.

In Fig.3 a schematic wave-particle in some excited state of the hydrogen atom is

shown. The particle-wave electron moves from left to right (for example, n = 2). In
Fig.3a)  the  velocity  of  the  electron  Vn  is  such  that  l

n  and  rn  correspond  exactly  to

Bohr's conditions:

Such  a  wave-particle  electron  returns  from  the  left  always  with  the  same  phase  and

reiterates its motion for an infinitely long time. If the velocity  of  the  electron  (V)  is
slightly different, the new l

 will also be slightly different (compared with l

n):

true stationary state; b) almost stationary state.

10

Such  a  particle-wave  electron  would  arrive  from  the  left  (Fig.  3b)  with  a  slightly

different phase. With time this difference increases and the moment when the sum of

the amplitudes becomes zero (for the first time) can be calculated; electron is no more

in  the  potential  well  of  the  wave  (like  classical  particles,  [8],  when  ‰

2=0)  and

could be accelerated. When this occurs defines the time of life of this excited atom.

The  sum  of  the  amplitudes  of  de  Broglie'  field  (D)  can  be  written  (like  classical

particles, [8]):

Similar to the results in [11], the "own life time" (t) of one single excited atom

(in state (n)) depends exactly on the energy difference ( ED

) (30). The own life time

(t [s]) is determined by the exact energy of excitation (

This time cannot be measured experimentally (except in the case shown in [4,11] for

the mean lifetime of an ensemble of excited atoms.

1997) [4,5].

[13] (for n>2) are impermissible.

n =1.60x10

s.  So,  the

result from the present calculations is in excellent agreement with reference data [13]

(for n=2). It is necessary to stress that the calculations fit better to the values in [13]

(1986).  The  differences  between  the  values  in  [12]  and  [13]  are  greater  than  the

differences  between  the  calculations  and  the  data  in  [13].  So,  the  Bohr’s  model

(complemented  with  de  Broglie’s  ideas)  continues  to  describe  hydrogen  properties

(mean  life  time,  natural  width  of  the  levels)  as  exactly  as  Bohr’s  hydrogen  model

describes the frequency of radiation.

8. Differences between the data.

As  it  is  known,  the  experimental  accuracy  for  frequency  measurement  is  very

great in comparison with accuracy of time measurements. An attempt to explain the

great  differences  [12,13]  between  reference  data  (for  n>2)  will  be  made.

Experimental results are very good only for the first excited states... The differences

18

between  reference  data  (for  n  >  2)  are  caused  by  experimental  difficulties  and

incorrect  application  of  the  relation  between  Einstein's  coefficients,  which  is

explained in [14,15].

In [12] the transition probability for spontaneous emission from upper state k to

lower state i, Aki, is related to the total intensity Iki of a line of frequency  n

where h is Planck's constant and Nk the population of state k. It was shown in [14,15]

that  this  relation  holds  for  transitions  from  any  excited  state  k  to  the  ground  state  i

only. If (i) is also an excited state, then relation (45) must be:

                   Iki=

where  Aix  is  the  full  decay  constant  of  level  (i)  and  gi,  g k  are  the  corresponding

statistical  weights.  Only  when  Aix=0  (ground  state),  (46)  coincides  with  (45).  The

same  applies  for  the  transition  probability  of  absorption  Bik  and  the  transition

 is the wavelength in Angstrom units). When (i) is an excited state, these relations

are  also  wrong.  According  to  [14,15],  these  relations  (in  the  same  units  as  in  [12])

It is also seen that if (i) is a ground state, 

, these relations  correspond  to  the

n

can have wrong values if  processed using the inappropriate (but commonly accepted)

relations [12].

The  mean  lifetimes  of  excited  levels  of  the  simplest  atom  -  hydrogen  -  obtained

herein  are  in  surprising  agreement  with  the  known  data.  At  the  same  time,  the

differences  between  the  reference  values  for  n>2,  shows  that  all  reference  data  for

transition  probabilities  in  hydrogen  must  be  critically  examined  and  adjusted

accurately according the present results.

9.  The  shape  of  acceleration  curve  and  the  shape  of  electromagnetic  field  of  the

soliton.

On the Fig.2 it is shown only one example of the acceleration curve. This curve

cannot  be  known  exactly,  because  the  shape  of  electromagnetic  field  of  the  soliton

(Fig.1)  also  is  not  known  exactly  [3].  We  know  from  electrodynamics  only  that  the

shape of two curves must exactly coincide. The two curves  can be symmetrical or not

symmetrical, but independently of its exact shape we can calculate the integral values

of necessary parameters for solitons (acceleration) emitted by hydrogen atom (8),(10).

field of soliton and acceleration of electron.

The possible shape of electromagnetic soliton.

The most often the shape of soliton curve (with a form like a bell) is described

Where t  is connected with the width of the impulse. (55) can be only one example; it

is not sure that electromagnetic field of the soliton [3] correspond exactly to (55), but

according to definition in [3] the electric field in the maximum of the curve (E0) and

from equation [16]:

E = (2/t )sech[(t – x/v)/ t ]

The shapes of the two curves (57 and (58) cannot be accepted as exact, but it is sure

that  they  must  correspond  to  each  other  and  the  equations  (56  and  59)  are  exact  by

definition.  Knowing  effective  length  of    electromagnetic  soliton  in  vacuum  (le)  and

effective path of electron (Hnk) one can estimate the average velocity of electron (vnk)

10. Some inevitable conclusions.

Here we are finding the effective acceleration of electron in hydrogen but it is

evident that the acceleration  vector changes in time and direction. These details I

cannot find now because only integral acceleration is known. If we know the exact

shape of electromagnetic field of the solitons (Fig.1), the exact shape of acceleration

curve (Fig.2) would be known also and vise versa. Now we can make only some

supposition about the changes of acceleration vector in space and time. This vector is

probably not radial, as it is not radial the path (Hnk) of the electron. The acceleration

vector describes some complicated curve  different of acceleration in an ordinary

dipole and it is sure that emission of a hydrogen atom cannot be presented as

emission of a vibrating dipole. In the beginning and on the end the acceleration of

electron must be zero and must have one positive maximum (Fig.1 and Fig.2). The

acceleration vector must describes some curve in the space for a very short effective

time te. This curve probably lay on the plane of velocity vectors and determines the

direction of soliton propagation.

Using only the bases of classical electrodynamics we can conclude that

electromagnetic field in every moment is emitted perpendicularly to the acceleration

vector in this moment. Electromagnetic field must be redistributed in different

directions and cannot form a soliton (electromagnetic particle) which propagate only

in one direction.

These simple calculations show that the most difficult question about the time

of transition in atoms can be answered combining  the soliton properties and the

22

Bohr’s model of atom. We think some inevitable changes in classical electrodynamics

are needed and this probably will change the quantum electrodynamics also.

Now it is clear that energy of the soliton is discrete in time and space as it is

discrete acceleration of the electron. We else do not know what is the exact shape of

acceleration and the exact shape of soliton electromagnetic field (Fig.1 and Fig.2), but

I hope that they can be found and consequently it can  be found the direction of the

soliton propagation.

The calculations show that Bohr's model of hydrogen is as useful as the real

field of  L.  de  Broglie  is. The  hydrogen  atomic  model  of  Bohr-de  Broglie  allow  (for
the first time) to calculate exactly the mean lifetime (t n = 1/An) of an ensemble of the

excited levels. If the energy of  excitation  is  different  from  that  corresponding  to  the

exact  conditions  for  a  stationary  state,  after  some  evolution  of  the  excited  state  the

Coulomb  field  can  change  the  state  of  the  electron  (acceleration)  because  the

amplitude  of  de  Broglie's  waves  becomes  zero  and  the  electron  is  no  more  in  a

potential well (the electron can emit a photon-soliton [1,2,3]). The main result of this

work is that excited states of the hydrogen atom decay after some exactly predictable

time (t) (30) and the emission of the photon-soliton takes an exact time (~

 te). Decay

is  not  an  accidental  event  as  it  is  believed  by  the  majority  of  scientists  (except

Einstein  who  wrote  that  a  weakness  of  the  theory  of  radiation  is  that  the  time  of
occurrence of an elementary process is left to "chance"). The mean life time (t

n ) is a

characteristic only of a statistical ensemble of excited atoms (40).

If a transition occurs between two excited states (En = R(1/n2) and Ek = R(1/k2)
the frequency of the emitted soliton is calculated according to: (En - Ek)/ !  = w nk. This

frequency  correspond  to  the  maximum  of  the  line    distribution  of  a  statistical

ensemble  of  hydrogen  atoms.  The  width  of  the  photon  line  is  the  sum  of  the  levels
width: G nk = G n+G k.

So,  for  a  statistical  ensemble  of  hydrogen  atoms  the  distances  of  electrons

from the protons (or energies),  are very different. In such an ensemble the probability

to  find  an  electron  at  some  distance  (or  energy)  from  the  proton  is  maximal  at  the

places  of  Bohr’s  stationary  orbits.  This  probability  is  smaller  at  other  places,  but

never  becomes  zero.  For  the  coordinate  systems  related  with  the  center  of  mass  of

every  hydrogen  atom,  these  probabilities  are  presented  on  Fig.5.  For  a  laboratory

23

coordinate  system  the  probabilities  depend  by  motions  of  the  center  of  masses  and

become consistent with contemporary quantum physics.

I  think  that  all  these  solitary  objects  do  not  contradict  Quantum  Mechanics

(QM) - especially the properties of a solitary hydrogen atom - but only reveal some

unknown  details  of  SQS.  It  seems  to  me  now,  that  the  properties  of  a  solitary

quantum  object  must  be  different  from  the  properties  of  the  statistical  ensemble  of

such objects and cannot be further neglected... As it is known, Bohr’s model of the

hydrogen atom concerns a solitary hydrogen atom. However, all experimental results

which  confirm  this  model  -  excited  states,  frequency  of  the  emitted  lines,  the

calculation  of  Rydberg’s  constant  and  so  on,  are  obtained  from  spectroscopic  data

about statistical ensembles of hydrogen atoms. The frequencies, exactly calculated by

Bohr,  correspond  to  the  frequencies  of  the  stationary  states  (at  the  maxima  of  the

lines).  Now, it is clear that the natural width of the lines (statistical ensemble) cannot

be  obtained  from  Bohr’s  conditions  only.  Bohr  himself  probably  could  solve  this

problem,  if  he  had  accepted  de  Broglie’s  ideas  about  the  coexistence  of  waves  and

particles.

To pay honor to Luis de Broglie who wrote:

“In  the  spring  of  my  life,  I  was  obsessed  with  the  problems  of  quanta  and  the

coexistence  of    waves  and  particles  in  the  world  of  micro-physics:  I  made  decisive

efforts,  although  incomplete,  to  discover  the  solution.  Now,  in  the  autumn  of  my

existence,  the  same  problem  still  preoccupies  me  because,  despite  of    the  many

successes  and  the  long  way  passed,  I  do  not  believe  that  the  enigma  is  indeed

resolved. The future, a future which I undoubtedly will never see, will maybe decide

the  problem:  it  will  tell  whether  my  present  point  of  view  is  an  error  of  an  already

sufficiently old man who is still devoted to the ideas of his youth, or, on the contrary,

this  is  a  clairvoyance  of  a  researcher  who  all  his  life  has  meditated  on  the  most

important  question  of  contemporary  Physics”.  (L.  de  Broglie,  Certitudes  et

incertitudes de la Science, Edition Albin Michel, Paris, 1966, p. 22; a free translation

from French).

I  realize  that  there  are  not  some  consecutive  descriptions  of  a  new

electrodynamics  of  electromagnetic  fields  and  charged  particles.  The  known

properties  of  solitons  [3]  and  hydrogen  atom  [4,5]  permit  to  think  about  and  to

24

describe some fragmentary, but very convincing and essential results, concerning the

reality  of  solitons  and  its  interactions  with  charged  particles.  It  is  evident  that  this

fragmentary  electrodynamics  is  not  complete,  but  I  hope  that  in  the  future  it  can  be

completed.

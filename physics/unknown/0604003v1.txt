Abstract 
 
This paper proposes that the elusive neutrino is a space-like unitary irreducible 
representation of the Poincare Group. Although its imaginary mass is not an amount 
physical measurable, its mass square is.

Introduction 
 
It has  been reported  by different groups of experimentalists that the mass square  of the 
neutrino is negative [1]. It is the purpose of the present manuscript to suggest a logical 
explanation to the fact that the square of the mass of the neutrino is negative. The unitary 
irreducible representations of the Poincare Group were classified by E. Wigner [2], and 
completed by Bargmann, Niarmak, and Chandra [3] in 1947. Based on the irreducibility 
of  the  representations,  they  identified  the  unitary  irreducible  representations  as 
elementary  particles.  Since  the  concept  of  an  elementary  particle  rests  on  the  lack  of 
further  structure  of  the matter  at that  level.  However,  Wigner  could  not  find  a  physical 
meaning to the representations in the region 1, 3, and 5 of the space-time like cone shown 
in  Figure  1.  In  this  manuscript,  the  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the  Group  of 
Poincare on the region 1 are discussed and identified as the representations that describe 
the  neutrino.  In  section  1  the  space-like  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the 
Poincare Group will be discussed. 
 
I. The Space-like Unitary Irreducible Representations of the Poincare Group 
 
In  the  space-like,  region  1,  the  eigenvalue  of  the  square  of  the  four-momentum  is  the 
negative of the square of the rest mass of the particle. Therefore, the mass would be an 
imaginary number. No physical interpretation of elementary particles had been associated 
to this region prior to this paper.

The  time-like  and  space-like  orbits  are  shown  as  thick  lines;  since  the  Heisenberg 
uncertainty principle allows tunneling from one to the other, as it is discussed in Ref. 4.

Conclusion 
 
The  fact  that  the  square  of  the  mass  of  the  neutrino  and  that  the  space-like  unitary 
irreducible  representations  of  the  Poincare  group  have  an  imaginary  mass  strongly 
suggest  that  the  mass  itself  does  not  have  an  independent  physical  meaning.  This  was 
m= −
already pointed out by Ref. 4. The eigenvalue of the four-momentum square is,
. 
This suggests that the physical measurable amount is the square of the four-momentum.

Abstract

The  RF  system  for  the  SNS  superconducting  linac
consists  of  a  superconducting  cavity,  a  klystron,  and  a
low-level  RF  (LLRF)  control  system.  For  a  proton  linac
like  SNS,  the  field  in  each  individual  cavity  needs  to  be
controlled  to  meet  the  overall  system  requirements.  The
purpose of the LLRF control system is to maintain the RF
cavity  field  to  a  desired  magnitude  and  phase  by
controlling  the  klystron  driver  signal.  The  Lorentz  force
detuning causes the shift of the resonant frequency during
the normal operation in the order of a few hundreds hertz.
In order to compensate the Lorentz force detuning effects,
the  cavity  is  pre-tuned  into  the  middle  of  the  expected
frequency  shift  caused  by  the  Lorentz  force  detuning.
Meanwhile,  to  reduce  the  overshoot  in  the  transient
response,  a  feed-forward  algorithm,  a  linear  parameter
varying gain scheduling (LPV-GS) controller, is proposed
to  get  away  a  repetitive  noised  caused  by  the  pulsed
operation as well as the Lorentz force detuning effects.

1  INTRODUCTION

To  analyse  the  performance  of  the  RF  control  system
for the SNS superconducting linac, a MATLAB model is
created  for  each  functional  blocks,  which  includes  the
superconducting  cavity  model,  klystron  model,  PID
feedback controller, and a feed-forward controller[1].  An
equivalent  resonant  circuit  couple  with  a  coupling
transformer is used for the superconduncting cavity model
in  which  the  Lorentz  force  detuning  of  the  cavity
resonance frequency is included. The klystron is modelled
as a cascade of a pass filter, determined by the bandwidth
of  the  klystron,  and  a  phase-magnitude  saturation  curve,
which  represents  the  saturation  characteristics  of  the
klystron.  The  phase-magnitude  saturation  curve 
is
obtained  from  the  measurement  and  is  further  analysed
using  the  curve  fitting  to  generate  the  final  model.  The
main  feedback  controller  is  a  PI  controller  for  an  easy
implementation  and  robustness  concern.  In  order  to
implement the RF control system in a full digital  control
system,  the  latency  analysis  is  needed  to  satisfy  the
performance requirement of the system.  Finally,  with  the
results  obtained  from  the  numerical  simulation  and  the
performance requirements, a full digital control system for
the LLRF system is proposed. In this system, a combined
CPLD and DSP technology is used to cope with different
requirements. The CPLD is applied to the critical path in

which  the  time  delay  needs  to  be  minimized.  While  the
DSP  is  used  to  perform  the  complex  linear  parameter
varying gain scheduling (LPV-GS) control which requires
the computation power but needs only be fed to the control
signal in the next pulse.

matrices B, BI, and C are given in [1].

In  the  model,  the  Lorentz  force  detuning  frequency
appears  on  in  the  system  matrix  A  and  all  other  system
matrices  are  constant.  In  observing  Equation  (2),  the
Lorentz  force  detuning  is  a  nonlinear  function  of  the
cavity  field,  which  renders  the  system  equation  (1)  a
nonlinear equation of the cavity field.

2.2 Linear Parameter Varying Gain Scheduling
Controller (LPV GS)

 The  principles  of  the  linear  parameter  varying  gain
scheduling can be  explained  as  the  followings.  First,  due
to  the  nonlinearity  of  the  system  equation,  which  comes
from both the saturation characteristic of the klystron and
the  nature  of  the  Lorentz  force  detuning  effect,  the
maximum performance of the RF control system can only
be achieved by implementing a variable gain-profile based
on  the  equilibrium  point  at  which  the  system  operates.
Secondly, at the equilibrium point, the system needs to be
linearized  for  solving  the  system  equation  (1).  Finally,
both 
the  feed-forward
controller  need  to  be  implemented  to  suppress  the
repetitive noise due to  the  pulsed  operation  and  a  known
effect of the Lorentz force detuning effect.

 From  the  analysis  and  the  simulation  results  obtained
from  our  modelling,  it  is  obviously  that  the  performance
requirements have been achieved with a full digital control
system in which the latency of the digital system has been
take  into  account  in  the  modelling.  However,  in  the  real
operation, other problems may arise, such as the effect of
the  microphonics.  The  performance  of  the  proposed  RF
control system in the real operation will be reported when
the data is available.

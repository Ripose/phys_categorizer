ABSTRACT 
 
The article describes the potential application of thermodynamic simulation to the problems of chemical 
aging  of  painting.  Qualitative  and  numerical  results  were  obtained  in  a  preliminary  investigation  by 
applying  the  method  to  various  mixtures  of  pigments  without  and  with  atmospheric  components.  The 
results were compared to the legendary recommendation on incompatible pigment mixtures with about 
an  80%  match  regarding  potential  color  changes  in  the  aged  mixtures  of  pigments.  Results  for  the 
cadmium yellow – lead white and cadmium lemon - emerald green mixtures are illustrated by pictures, 
gradually showing color changes related to the aging. The method of thermodynamic simulation can be a 
powerful tool to investigate old masterpieces, in developing new materials, and to forecast some aspects 
of the aging of real masterpieces.    
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Color is the first and quite often the major agent binding the painting with the viewers, and color is the 
first to suffer at the aging of a painting. Often starting with fading, color changes in paint layers after a 
certain  time  may  heavily  damage  the  whole  picture.  Old  painting  collections  in  the  world  museums 
abound  with  darkened  canvases  because  of  painting  vulnerability  to  many  detrimental,  external  and 
internal impacts. The age of the old tempera paintings estimated as one thousand years; usage of the oil 
binders is probably as twice as younger [1]. Both had enough time, mostly in unfavorable conditions, to 
show heavy changes really occurred in color and picture. Works of old Flemish masters were kept for a 
long  time  in  their  enemies’  hands  before  being  placed  in  the  museums.  At  a  glance,  the  Van  Gogh’s 
heritage had more luck; his works have been appreciated for only about 5 decades after his death. But 
general neglect of the good taste in painting techniques and materials, typical for the second half of 19th 
century, didn’t bypass his works, and many of them showed definite results of the chemical deteriorating 
processes within the paint layers [2]; a story of Van Gough’s “Roses” was told in [3]. 
Though  external  enemies  –  climatic  factors  (temperature,  humidity,  ultraviolet  radiation),  bacteria  and 
reckless people as well – are always at work, their efforts can be tangibly restricted in many cases. But in 
the long term the major reasons for changes of the color of a painting result from the chemical aging of 
the  paint  layers.  Those  changes  include  changes  in  the  optical  properties  of  binders,  and  changes  in 
chemical  and  structural  composition  of  pigments  due  to  chemical  interactions  between  them  and  with 
atmospheric  compounds.  Chemical  deterioration  due  to  interaction  between  paint  layer  components, 
assisted by atmospheric species, looks to be immanent to the aging process.  
The  patterns  of  the  aging  of  painting  have  been  intensively  studied,  and  seem  to  be  quite  clear  on  a 
qualitative  level  (results  and  ideas  are  summarized  briefly  in  [4]).  Original  paintings  are  usually  well 
protected against chemical impact. Being a complex composition of grounds, pigments, organic binders, 
and  varnish,  in  an  ideal  case  the  fresh  paint  layer  contains  well-encapsulated  pigment  particles.  The 
particles are separated from the base (canvas, wood, etc.) by grounds, from each other and the ground - 
by  the  binder,  and  from  the  atmospheric  air  -  by  both  the  binder  and  a  varnish  layer.  As  long  as  the 
grounds, binders and varnish are intact, routine changes of paint layers are extremely slow. But even in 
the most favorable storage conditions, the upper layer often ages faster than the inner layers. Initially it 
leads to darkening due to a change in the optical characteristics of the varnish, and then multiple cracks 
inevitably open up. From the opposite side, binders and grounds also can crack due to the temperature 

`

and humidity variations, periodical removals of the canvas from stretcher and placing it back, or due to 
drying of the wood basis. To make the grounds more elastic, artists used animal glue, particularly fish 
glue, sometimes adding honey as plasticizer – all those components are so tasteful to bacteria that glue 
layers  and  grounds  easily  undergo  the  biodegradation.  Protection  of  the  color  bearing  paint  layer 
becomes more and more illusive. Moisture and some atmospheric components, penetrating through the 
cracks, sharply accelerate chemical interactions between pigments and other ingredients of the layer thus 
leading to intensive changes in its chemical and phase composition. Sooner or later, our eye can identify 
besides cracks the massive changes in the color, brightness and contrast of the painting. Finally it calls 
for restorer. The restorer tries all his/her best to bring the painting to a “like new” look, but there is no 
guarantee  that  then  it  looks  like  it  was  created.  To  the  best  of  the  author’s  knowledge,  no  one  of  old 
masters ever took a color photo picture of his masterpiece. 
A painting is unique. Probably, chemical and relevant color changes at the first stages of aging may turn 
it to a more unique thing, but anyway it will be different from the original. What can we do and to what 
extent can we prevent the chemical changes? In contrast to bio and physical reasons of aging, chemical 
aging – as we understand it - has been never deeply studied. We know some very general, legendary old 
masters’ recommendations on the incompatibility of certain couples of inorganic pigments, like “white 
lead – ultramarine” and some others, originated from long time experience [5].  Besides that the artist 
also has to take into consideration certain technological approaches. In any case, we need a quantitative 
picture of what’s going on at the aging.  
 
THE METHOD OF THERMODYNAMIC SIMULATION 
 
The  method  of  thermodynamic  simulation  consists  of  the  computer  simulation  of  possible  chemical 
interactions  within  the  paint  layer  to  determine  the  ultimate  chemical  and  phase  equilibrium 
composition.  It  allows  for  numerical  calculations  of  the  most  probable  final  composition  of  the  paint 
layer, resulting from these interactions when all changes are over and the system rests at thermodynamic 
equilibrium.  One  can  state  that  in  old  art  pieces  most  of  the  possible  chemical  processes,  allowed  by 
their  pre-museum  and  museum  storage  conditions,  are  either  completed,  or  the  relevant  changes  are 
already well pronounced. Knowledge of the chemical and phase changes in the layer may help to predict 
optical/color changes and such structural damages (like the paint layer dropping down).  
The method can be implemented using most of the known simulation software; we used the simulation 
complex ASTRA-4 [6] and partly HSC Chemistry [7].  A pressure of 0.1 Pa and a temperature of 293K 
(200C) were taken as simulation parameters. In case of pair mixtures of pigments, the mass ratio of main 
to admixed components varied from 10:1 to 1:1. Taking into account very long life time of the painting, 
atmospheric air as a natural mixture of oxygen and nitrogen was presented in the initial compositions up 
to 10%, with moisture up to 5% of the air mass and some typical pollutants like CO, CO2, sometimes 
SO2 and H2S up to concentrations, typical for big cities.  
In  cases  when  not  enough  thermodynamic  data  was  available  to  involve  some  complex  pigments  of 
interest  into  simulation,  we  used  their  essential  and  often  the  major  color  carrying  fragments.  For 
example,  in  case  of  lead  white  we  used  the  data  for  lead  carbonate  only;  in  this  case  simulation  was 
carried out with the fragment of the pigment with known data instead of the whole compound. The same 
situation occurred in case of ultramarine and several others. Though in most cases this was good enough 
to  judge  the  possible  color  changes,  the  results  of  this  work  should  be  considered  qualitative  for 
manifesting the method’s ability to predict and describe the chemical aging of painting.  
 
THE SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
We  tried  chemical  interactions  within  several  groups  of  pigments  and  atmospheric  components, 
including interactions of various pigments with atmospheric components; white lead and zinc white with 
some  pigments  in  presence  of  atmospheric  components;  oxide  pigments  in  mixtures  with  sulfide 

` 

pigments; special pairs of pigments to check the legendary incompatible pigment couples; some complex 
mixtures from the P. P. Rubens palette. 
Among them the group of “tabooed” incompatible couples of pigments is one of the most interesting in 
the  light  of  this  work.  Corresponding  results  are  shown  in  Table  I.  Empirical  legendary  results  were 
taken  from  [4].  In  some  cases,  when  dark  and  white  substances  were  formed  in  the  mixture  together 
(such as FeS, CaS, and Na2CO3 in ultramarine mixtures with ochers and umbers), it was difficult to

evaluate  if  optical  changes  would  happen.  Also,  gaseous  reaction  products  are  not  shown  in  the  table. 
Even with this restriction, in about 80% of investigated couples the predicted possible optical changes 
have certainly matched the legendary changes. What is remarkable is that the method of thermodynamic 
simulation also explains possible reasons of the changes in terms of chemical and structure composition 
thus allowing for visual interpretation. Percentage of the matching Y/N compatibility results in Table I is 
high enough to prove the applicability of the method to the analysis of chemical aging of painting at least 
on the qualitative level. The quantitative results definitely will bring up more information though they 
are harder to get. Table II contains numeric simulation results of the incompatible couple mixture of lead 
white (represented by lead carbonate) with yellow cadmium (represented by cadmium and zinc sulfides). 
The abbreviations for colors are B for black, W for white or of light colors, and Y for yellow. To take 
into  account  the  lead  carbonate  binding  in  2PbCO3*Pb(OH)3,  its  thermodynamic  activity  coefficient 
was reduced to 0.6 for simulation. One can see the changes in the chemical composition of the mixture 
due to decay of input basic color carriers, sure structural changes due to arrival of new components, and 
drastic color changes with arrival of black lead sulfide. Fig.1 shows color visualization of the simulation 
results, RGB indices were calculated using data for yellow cadmium from [8]. Colors of mixtures were 
calculated as weighted mean of the ingredients’ colors [9].

Fig.2 shows the aged samples of the cadmium lemon mixture with emerald green, compared to 
the  initial  colors  (upper  row);  numbers  on  the  swatches  show  initial  moles  ratio  Cd/Emerald 
Green in the mixture. Interestingly, that Cd-pigment almost totally disappears in all investigated 
mixtures after ageing; its increase in the initial mixture leads to more and more pronounced grey 
color due to formation of dark, fine dispersed particles of Cu3As and Cu2O along with several 
white products.   
 
CHEMICAL  AGING  OF  SOME  RUBENS’  PIGMENT  MIXTURES   

 
Rubens was one of those rare artists who thoroughly wrote down the major components of the mixtures 
he used in various purposes, sometimes with a kind of functional names [1], that allows us to experiment 
with  his  palette.  Qualitative  results  of  the  simulation  of  the  mixtures  aging  in  presence  of  normal  air 
(with typical some moisture) are placed in Table III.

CONCLUSION 
 
This work presents the results of computer experiment in the field where all knowledge was and still is 
very  approximate,  collected  from  judgments  of  old  paintings  with  not  precisely  known  initial 
compositions. The data, related to paintings aging and pigments compatibility nomads from one printed 
or  electronic  source  to  another,  quite  often  without  clear  references.  In  spite  of  importance  of  this 

`

knowledge, no one can indicate any solid collection or a survey. Certain information definitely can be 
achieved after centuries of waiting or using accelerated methods, usually run at conditions different than 
natural  (like  elevated  temperatures).  In  most  cases  the  verbal  level  of  description  of  the  changes  is 
prevailing in the art aging research up to present time ([10], a good example). To the best of the author’s 
knowledge,  our  approach  is  the  first  attempt  to  use  an  experimental  method  to  replace  word-of-the-
mouth legends.   
Discussing the results of this work, one should keep in mind that thermodynamic simulation brings up 
the  ultimate  results  of  aging  –  potential  chemical  and  structural  changes  providing  that  all  possible 
interactions  in  the  ground-pigment-binder-varnish  system  are  over,  that  is  in  thermodynamic 
equilibrium. Equilibrium compositions, in their turn, should be thought as the limit, to which the system 
tends to move, but not necessarily achieves it in reality. Chemical aging runs to a full gear at the latest 
stages of the life of a painting, and is just one of possible major contributors to the aging processes. 
Though  the  scope  of  this  investigation  was  restricted  to  inorganic  pigments,  the  offered  method  is 
applicable  to  analyze  chemical  interactions  between  any  kind  of  substances  including  organic  dyes, 
binders  and  grounds.  Gigantic  color  and  computational  abilities  of  the  current  computers  essentially 
expand opportunities for simulation and output of the simulation results in such complicated objects like 
painting mixtures. Besides that, the method can be used to investigate chemical behavior not only of a 
painting  but  also  of  any  art  materials  that  change  by  interacting  with  their  environment.  Although  the 
method investigates only one important aspect of the aging of paintings, in certain cases its results can 
explain and help the restorers better than other approaches. 
It is not very simple to use the method of thermodynamic simulation in the field of aging because only 
rare pigments are chemically simple enough to have their thermodynamic properties ready in the regular 
thermodynamic  data  bases.  Calculation  or  experimental  finding  appropriate  information  would  be  the 
first task to be solved prior to implementation of the method. 
The author foresees many objections related to the results of this article. Among them – why most of the 
species,  predicted  in  the  run  of  that  preliminary  investigation,  were  never  reported  by  previous 
investigators?  Well,  it  could  be  that  the  art  pieces,  investigated  earlier  on,  didn’t  achieve  the  extreme 
stages  that  could  be  qualified  as  equilibrium  in  the  context  of  this  article.  Or  –  what  if  they  were  just 
overlooked because nobody suspected them to be present?   
Who could be interested in using this method? It can definitely help to investigate possible reasons for 
the changes that happened, and the changes that will happen. It could be useful for attribution purposes, 
solving the so called back task of simulation - to find out the initial composition of the paint mixture, 
having the chemical analysis of the aged sample. The manufacturers of art materials could also use the 
method to evaluate their products in various mixtures and environmental conditions, for instance, to find 
proper  temperatures  for  the  expedited  aging  research.  As  concerns  to  the  artists,  it’s  of  a  very  low 
probability that Jackson Pollock would ever be willing to hear about any simulation program, but P. P. 
Rubens definitely might be interested to use it.

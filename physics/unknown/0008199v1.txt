Abstract

The superconducting  (SC) proton  linac is  proposed  in
the JAERI/KEK Joint Project for a high-intensity proton
accelerator  in  the  energy  region  from  400  to  600  MeV.
Highly stable fields in the SC cavities are required under
the  dynamic  Lorentz  force  detuning.  A  new  model
describing  the  dynamic  Lorentz  detuning  has  been
developed  and 
the  validity  has  been  confirmed
experimentally. The model has been applied successfully
to the rf control simulation of the SC proton linac.

1  INTRODUCTION

The  Japan  Atomic  Energy  Research  Institute  (JAERI)
and the  High Energy  Accelerator Research  Organization
(KEK) are proposing the Joint Project for High Intensity
Proton  Accelerator[1,2].  The  accelerator  consists  of  600
MeV  linac,  3  GeV  RCS  (Rapid  Cycling  Synchrotron)
and 50 GeV synchrotron. SC structures are applied in the
high  energy  part  of  the  linac  from  400  to  600  MeV.
Momentum spread of the linac beams less than ±0.1% is
required 
the
commissioning  of  the  accelerator,  400  MeV  beams  will
be injected into the RCS. In this period, the SC linac will
provide the beams to the R&D for the ADS (Accelerator
Driven System) and the machine study will be carried out
to obtain acceptable beam quality for the RCS. In order to
increase the beam intensity, the 600 MeV beams will be
injected into the RCS after the machine study.

The  linac  accelerates  H-  beams  in  a  pulsed  operation;
repetition  rate  of  50  Hz,  beam  duration  of  0.5  ms,  peak
current of 50 mA and intermediate duty factor of 54 % by
chopping.  To  meet  the  requirement  of  the  RCS,  rf
amplitude  and  phase  errors  of  the  accelerating  cavities
should be less than ±1% and ±1deg, respectively. In  the
case of the SC cavities, the Lorentz force of the pulsed rf
field  induces  dynamic  deformation  and  detuning  of  the
cavity, which disturb the accelerating field stability.

A  new  model  which  describes  the  dynamic  Lorentz
force  detuning  has  been  established  for  the  rf  control
simulation  in  the  pulsed  SC  linac.  The  validity  of  the
model has been confirmed experimentally. The model has
been applied to the rf control simulation.

A  new  model,  comparison  between  calculated  and
experimental  results,  dynamic  Lorentz  detuning  for  the
multi-cell  cavity  and  the  rf  control  simulation  are
presented in this paper.

2  MODEL FOR DYNAMIC LORENTZ

DETUNING

2.1  Stationary Lorentz Detuning

SC cavities are deformed by the Lorentz force of their
own  electromagnetic  field.  The  Lorentz  pressure  (P)  on
the cavity wall is presented by the equation[3],

 ,

where H and E are magnetic and electric field strength on
the  cavity  surface.  Since  the  cavity  deformation  is
proportional to the Lorentz pressure, the detuning (∆f) is
proportional  to  the  square  of  the  accelerating  field  (Eacc)
by  assuming  linearity  between  the  deformation  and  the
detuning.  In  our  Joint  Project,  two  kind  of  972  MHz
cavities,  β
g  (geometrical  β  of  the  cavity)  =  0.729  and
0.771, are designed between 400 and 600 MeV region[4].
The  detuning  constants  k  (=  -∆f/Eacc
2)  of  these  7-cell
cavities are 1.61 and 1.42 Hz/(MV/m)2, respectively.
 2.2  Lorentz Vibration Model

 To  simulate  the  rf  control,  the  time-dependent  cavity
field  and  detuning  have  to  be  solved  simultaneously,
because these affect each other.  For this purpose, a new
model which describes dynamic Lorentz detuning, named
Lorentz Vibration Model, has been developed.
 The basic idea of the model is listed below.
•  The  dynamic  motion  of  the  cavity  is  expanded  in
terms  of  the  mechanical  modes.  This  method  is
known as “Modal Analysis”.

•  Cavity  deformation  for  each  mechanical  mode  is
converted  to  the  partial  detuning  for  each  mode
using frequency sensitivity data.

•  Total  detuning  is  obtained  by  summing  up  the

partial detuning for each mode.

 According  to  this  basic  idea,  we  have  obtained  the
Lorentz Vibration Model as the following equations.

 2.3  Pulsed Operation in the Vertical Test

 In  order  to  observe  the  dynamic  Lorentz  detuning
experimentally, a pulsed operation was carried out in the
vertical test of a single-cell 600MHz cavity of β
g=0.886.
In the test, one side of the cavity flange was fixed to the
cryostat  and  the  other  side  was  free.  The  measurement
was made at 4.2 K. Unloaded and loaded quality factors
of the cavity were ~9×108 and ~9×107, respectively.

 Figure  1  shows  the  rf  power  control  signal,  which  is
proportional to the amplifier output power (max. 300W),
and the surface peak field of the cavity (Epeak) in a pulse.
Rise time, flat top and repetition rate were 60 ms, 100 ms
and  0.76  Hz,  respectively.  The  cavity  was  excited  even
between the pulses with very low field (Epeak~0.7 MV/m)
in  order  to  keep  lock  of  a  PLL  (Phase  Locked  Loop)
circuit.  Dynamic  Lorentz  detuning  was  measured  by
taking an FM control signal of the PLL circuit through a
low path filter of 1 kHz. The signal was accumulated for
about 40 pulses and averaged to eliminate random noises.
 Figure 2 shows the dynamic Lorentz detuning obtained
in the test. Vibration of the detuning was observed at the
flat top and decay of the pulse. Impulses at the beginning
of the rise and both ends of the flat top were due to the

responses  of  the  PLL  circuit.  The  frequency  and    the
quality  factor  of  the  vibration  were  estimated  to  be  122
Hz  and  ~60,  respectively,  by  analysing  the  waveform  at
the decay.

 To  prepare  the  parameters  for  the  Lorentz  Vibration
Model,  the  SUPERFISH  and  the  ABAQUS  calculations
were  performed  and  then  we  found  that  only  the  first
mode  dominates  the  deformation.  The  frequency  of  the
mode  was  calculated  to  be  111  Hz,  which  agreed  well
with  the  experimental  results.  In  the  Lorentz  Vibration
Model  calculation,  VC  and  Qm  obtained  experimentally
were used. Figure 3 shows the calculated result compared
with the experimental results. The average detuning at the
flat  top  for  the  calculated  and  experimental  data  agreed
within  10  %.  The  calculation  also  reproduces  the
behaviour  of  the  vibration  at  the  flat  top  and  the  decay.
Since the geometry and the boundary conditions are very
simple  in  this  calculation,  the  agreement  between  the
Model  calculation  and  the  experiment  indicates  the
validity of the Lorentz Vibration Model.

 Small disagreement between the measurement and the
calculation shown in Fig. 3 is considered due to the errors
of  the  parameters  used  in  the  calculation  as  well  as
measurement  error.  In  applying  the  Lorentz  Vibration
Model,  ω
m1  and  K1  (only  the  first  mode  dominates  the
detuning  in  this  case)  were  modified  so  as  to  reproduce
the experimental data. Figure 4 shows the comparison of
the modified calculated results and the experimental data
at  the  flat  top  region.  In  the  figure,  the  agreements
between those data are very good.

 3  DYNAMIC LORENTZ DETUNING FOR

MULTI-CELL CAVITY

 The  Lorentz  Vibration  Model  has  been  applied  to  the
analysis of the dynamic detuning in the pulsed operation
for the 972 MHz 7-cell cavity of β
g=0.729. The thickness
of the cavity was set to be 2.8 mm.

 3.1  Mechanical Modes of the 7-cell cavity

 At the first step of the analysis, 150 mechanical modes
were  calculated  by  the  ABAQUS  code.  Figure  5  shows
the typical modes as well as the stationary deformation by
the Lorentz force. In this calculation, the left side of the
cavity  was  fixed  and  the  other  side  was  supported  by  a
spring  as  a  tuner  support.  We  found  three  kinds  of
mechanical modes; (a) multi-cell modes, in which modes,
cell  position  moves  with  lower  frequency,  (b)  tuner  and
beampipe modes, in which modes, only either end cell is

deformed, and (c) single-cell mode, in which modes, cell
position  is  fixed  but  each  cell  shape  is  deformed  with
higher  frequency.  Some  of  the  single-cell  modes  have
dominant  influences  to  the  detuning.  Multi-cell  modes
have much less influences to the stationary detuning but
are excited by the pulsed operation when the frequencies
meet the multiple of the repetition rate.

 Quality factors for the mechanical modes were set to be
250,  100  and  1000  for  the  multi-cell  modes,  tuner  &
beampipe  modes  and  single-cell  modes,  respectively.
Those values are based on our experimental experiences.

 3.2  Choice of Mechanical Modes

 According  to  the  Lorentz  Vibration  Model,  we  can
consider the stationary condition by applying (d2∆fk/dt2) =
(d∆fk/dt) = 0. Then we obtain the stationary detuning for
each  mode,  ∆fk=Kk(VC/V0)2/ω
2.  From  these  data,  we
chose  dominant  21  modes  out  of  the  150  modes  for  the
Lorentz Vibration Model calculation; 9 multi-cell modes,
2 tuner & beampipe modes and 10 single-cell modes.

 3.3  Conventional Pulsed Operation

 The  Lorentz  Vibration  Model  was  applied  to  the
calculation of the dynamic detuning for the conventional
pulsed  operation,  in  which  the  cavity  voltage  increases
exponentially for 0.6 ms, holds for 0.6 ms and decreases
exponentially. Figure 6 shows the dynamic detuning, total
detuning and some of the partial detuning, as well as the
cavity  voltage  (VC).  In  this  calculation,  some  of  the
single-cell  mode  vibrations  are  excited  by  a  pulsed
voltage  and  the  total  detuning  sways  in  the  flat  top  and
after the pulse. The vibration in the flat top causes cavity
field  error  and  the  vibration  after  the  pulse  affects  the
next pulse.

 3.4  Cosine-shaped Cavity Excitation

 In order to reduce the single-cell mode vibrations, we
applied  the  cosine-shaped  cavity  excitation,  in  which
cavity voltage increases and decreases in a cosine-shape.
Figure  7  shows  the  cavity  voltage  and  the  dynamic
detuning for the cosine-shaped cavity excitation. The rise

time  and  the  flat  top  duration  were  the  same  as  the
conventional  pulsed  operation.  The  cosine-shape  decay
was  connected  smoothly  to  the  exponential  decay.  The
vibration  of  the  single-cell  modes  are  much  reduced  as
shown in Fig. 7.

 Since this method is considered to be suitable to obtain
highly stable cavity field, it was applied to the rf control
simulations described in the next section.

 4  RF CONTROL SIMULATION

 In  the  case  that  an  rf  source  feeds  the  rf  power  to  a
single  cavity,  the  good  stability  of  the  cavity  field  is
expected  because  the  influence  of  the  dynamic  Lorentz
detuning can be compensated by an rf low level controller.
In  the  system  design  of  the  JAERI/KEK  Joint  Project,
two  cavities  in  a  cryomodule  are  controlled  in  one  rf
system. In this work, the rf control system of two cavities
with individual mechanical properties, which is caused by
fabrication  errors,  has  been  simulated.  We  assumed  the
different  cavity  wall  thickness  for  providing  individual
mechanical properties and 2 simulations were performed;
cavities of 2.8 mm and 3.2 mm thick, and 2.8mm and 3.0
mm thick. Loaded quality factor of the cavities are set to
be 3.5×105 which is a half of the optimum one. This over-

 Figure 8 shows the schematic block diagram of the  rf

two  cavities  were  applied.  The  feed  forward  (FF)

waveform for the beam loading compensation. The cavity

performed  by  the  feed  back  (FB)  controller.  The  detune
offset against the Lorentz detuning is optimized for each
cavity because of the individual mechanical property.

 4.2  Simulation with cavities of 2.8 mm and 3.2
mm thick

 The  rf  control  simulation  with  2  cavities  was  carried
out for 800 ms (40 pulses), where the wall thicknesses of
cavity  #1  and  cavity  #2  are  2.8  mm  and  3.2  mm,
respectively. The dynamic Lorentz detuning including the
detune offset is plotted in Fig.  9 at every 0.1 second.  In
the  figure,  detuning  of  0  degree  means  the  optimum
frequency. The proper offset for each cavity provides the
good detuning in the beam period, ±~10Hz and  ±~20Hz
for  the  cavity  #1  and  #2,  respectively.  Figure  10  shows
the  amplitude  and  phase  errors  for  those  cavities.  The
amplitude  errors  up  to  ±~0.1  %  and  phase  errors  up  to
±~0.2 deg were obtained for both cavities, while only the
first pulse has slightly larger errors. Adopting the cosine-
shaped  cavity  excitation  and  the  proper  detune  offsets
provide  very  good  stability,  which  satisfies 
the
requirement of ±1% and ±1deg.

 4.3  Simulation with cavities of 2.8 mm and 3.0
mm thick

 The  rf  control  simulation  with  cavities  of  wall
thicknesses of 2.8 mm (cavity #1) and 3.0 mm (cavity #3)
were  also  carried  out  for  1000  ms  (50  pulses).
Unfortunately,  the  cavity  #3  has  a  multi-cell  mode  of
349.5  Hz,  which  is  very  close  to  the  multiple  of  the

dynamic  detuning  for  cavity  #3.  The  oscillation  of  the
multi-cell  mode  is  emphasized  significantly  as  shown  in
Fig. 11. The amplitude of the multi-cell mode is about 60
Hz.  Figure  12  shows  the  dynamic  Lorentz  detuning
including  the  detune  offset.  The  detune  offset  for  the
cavity  #3  (116  Hz)  was  provided  with  consideration  of
the excited multi-cell amplitude. Therefore, the detuning
of the cavity #3 in the first pulse is far from the optimum
position  of  0  Hz  in  the  beam  period,  but  after  several
hundreds ms it becomes closer value as emphasizing the
multi-cell  mode.  Figure  13  shows  the  amplitude  and
phase  errors  for  cavity  #1  and  #3.  The  errors  are  large
within  several  hundreds  ms,  however,  they  become
smaller  after  that  because  of  the  stationary  vibration  of
the multi-cell mode. At the time of 900 ms, we obtained
the  errors  of  ±0.15%  and  ±0.6deg  for  amplitude  and
phase, respectively. Even in this case, the stability of the
cavity field satisfies the requirement.

field  stability  of  the  SC  proton  linac,  the  Lorentz
Vibration  Model  describing 
the  dynamic  Lorentz
detuning  has  been  developed.  The  validity  of  the  new
model  has  been  confirmed  experimentally.  The  model
was  applied  successfully  to  the  rf  control  simulation  for
972  MHz  7-cell  cavity  of  β
g=0.729.  Here,  we  have
obtained  good  cavity  field  stability  which  satisfied  the
requirement.

Micro-economic  Analysis  of 
the  Physical 
Constrained Markets: Game Theory Application 
to Competitive Electricity Markets

Abstract- Competition has been introduced in the electricity 
markets  with  the  goal  of  reducing  prices  and  improving 
efficiency.  The  basic  idea  which  stays  behind  this  choice  is 
that, in competitive markets, a greater quantity of the good 
is exchanged at a lower and a lower price, leading to higher 
market efficiency.  

Electricity  markets  are  pretty  different  from  other 
commodities  mainly due to the physical constraints  related 
to  the  network  structure  that  may  impact  the  market 
performance. The network structure of the system on which 
the  economic  transactions  need  to  be  undertaken  poses 
strict physical and operational constraints.  

Strategic  interactions  among  producers  that  game  the 
market  with  the  objective  of  maximizing  their  producer 
surplus  must  be  taken 
into  account  when  modeling 
competitive  electricity  markets.  The  physical  constraints, 
specific  of  the  electricity  markets,  provide  additional 
opportunity of gaming to the market players. Game theory 
provides  a  tool  to  model  such  a  context.    This  paper 
discussed  the  application  of  game  theory  to  physical 
constrained  electricity  markets  with  the  goal  of  providing 
tools for assessing the market performance and pinpointing 
the critical network constraints that may impact the market 
efficiency.  The  basic  models  of  game  theory  specifically 
designed  to  represent  the  electricity  markets  will  be 
presented.  IEEE30  bus  test  system  of  the  constrained 
electricity  market  will  be  discussed  to  show  the  network 
impacts  on  the  market  performances  in  presence  of 
strategic bidding behavior of the producers.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Nowadays the liberalization of the power industry has 
been implemented in many countries. The introduction of 
the deregulation has not always proved to be as efficient 
as expected. In California [1, 2], the market experienced 
huge problems.  From May 2000 to May 2001, the price 
hit  frequently  the  cap  and  forced  the  regulator  to  revise 
the price cap downward. The average price of December 
2000 was 317 $/MWh, almost ten times higher than usual. 
In June 1998, wholesale electricity price in Midwest US

market  reached  7,000  $/MWh  [3].  Starting  from  the 
regulated  monopoly,  the  competition  in  the  electricity 
markets was aimed to improve market efficiency toward 
the  theoretical  reference  model  of  perfect  competition. 
Actually,  due 
the 
electricity  markets  are  oligopoly  in  which  the  market 
performances  are  in-between  perfect  competition  and 
monopoly. In this context, the task of the regulators is to 
force them toward perfect competition  while  monitoring 
continuously  the  distance  from  such  a  condition,  or  to 
avoid market power exploitation. 

the  structural  characteristics, 

In the electricity markets, as well as in other markets, 
market  power  may  arise  striving  for  larger  amount  of 
profits  or  surpluses  with  high  prices  and  capacity 
withdrawals,  compared  with  the  competitive  values  [4]. 
Game  theory  [5-6]  can  capture  the  strategic  interactions 
among producers who are aware that their results depend 
on  other  competitors’  decisions.  Based  on  the  game 
theory,  [10-22]  investigated  the  strategic  interactions 
among producers in electricity markets.  

In addition to the traditional causes of market power, 
in  the  electricity  markets,  the  network  constraints  may 
give  additional  possibilities  of  market  power  behaviors 
arising  that  are  very  specific  of  this  contest.  An 
instantaneous  balance  between  power  injected  by  the 
generators  and  the  power  withdrawn  by  loads  plus  the 
transmission  losses  should  be  guaranteed  to  keep  the 
system frequency at the rated value. The Kirchhoff laws 
must  be  satisfied  and  a  power  balance  at  each  bus  must 
be enforced. The power flow paths, directions and values, 
are  depended  on  the  bus  voltage  profile  and  primary 
constants  of  the  transmission  lines  and  those  lines  have 
flow  limits  including  thermal,  voltage  drop  and  stability 
limits. In addition, from the operational point of view, the 
voltage  profile  of  the  system  must  be  kept  within  a 
specific  interval.  Therefore,  the  power  systems  that 
accommodate  the  economic  transactions  in  the  market 
need to be operated under strict physical and operational 
constraints to assure its feasibility; if these constraints are 
binding  the  system  is  said  to  be  congested  and  proper 
measures need to be undertaken [7]. This paper is aimed 
to discuses the network constraints impacts on the market 
performances under oligopoly models.  

This  paper  consists  of  four  additional  sections.  In 
section  II,  the  market  clearing  model  under  network 
constraints  is  introduced.  Section  III  discusses  different 
game  models  while  in  section  IV  the  numerical  studies 
with respect to IEEE30 bus system is presented .Section 
V provides some conclusive remarks.

the 
responsibility  of  coordinating  the  aggregate  offers  from 
the  supply  side  and  the  aggregate  demand  curves  for  a 
specified  time  interval  trading,  usually  one  hour.  That 
leads 
the  determination  of  market  equilibrium, 
characterized by a unique market clearing price (λ) and a 
market  clearing  quantity  (q)  (Fig.1  left).  The  social 
surplus  is  composed  by  the  consumer  surplus  (SC  )  and 
producer surplus (SG ). However, due to the peculiarities 
of  the  electricity  transmission,  the  transactions  must  be 
settled  according  to  the  physical  constraints  of  the 
electricity  network  and  different  nodal  prices  may  arise 
when  the  flow  limits  are  binding  (λ′′  and  λ′  are 
respectively  for  the  demand  side  and  supply  side,  Fig.1 
right).  In  this  case,  merchandise  surplus  (SM )  will  arise, 
the  area  λ′′EAλ′(Fig.1  right).  The  social  surplus  is  equal 
to  the  summation  of  the  consumer  surplus,  merchandise 
surplus and producer surplus.

A producer that is unable to exercise market power is 
known as price taker. According to the classic economic 
theory,  a  price-taking  producer  that  wishes  to  maximize 
his  profits  would  bid  his  power  production  at  his  own 
marginal  cost  and  the  market  is  characterized  as  perfect 
competition [8-9].  

In  perfect  competition  markets  a  large  number  of 
price-taking  producers  with  a  very  small  market  share 
produce  homogeneous  and  perfectly 
substitutable 
commodities.  Furthermore  the  market  should  not  have 
significant entry barriers but have free mobility of all the 
related  production  resources  and  perfect  information 
among  producers.  Although  the  perfect  competition  is 
completely unrealistic, it can serve as a reference case to 
identify  market  power  behaviors  in  a  practical  market, 
basing on the fact of that perfect competition would lead 
to the most efficient market performance.  
Network  constraints  distinguish 

the  electricity 
markets  from  most  of  other  commodity  markets.

cost function of the producer g is:

where ed and the hd are respectively the intercept ($/MW) 
and slope (negative, $/MW2) of the demand function; qd  
is the demand quantity of the load d (MW);  DDDD is the set

However,  the  perfect  competition  is  just  an  ideal 
market  that  serves  as  reference  case.  The  electricity 
market  is  closer  to  the  oligopoly  model  in  which  the 
producers  may  exert  market  power  behaviours 
in 
presence of strategic biddings to maximize their producer 
surpluses.  Modelling  the  oligopoly  market  clearing  is 
done  by  substituting  the  marginal  cost  curves  in  the 
objective  function  of  the  perfect  competition  model  (4) 
with  the  strategic  biddings  of  the  producers  and  the 
object function value is called system surplus. 

III. OLIGOPOLY COMPETITION MODELS: GAME THEORY 

APPLICATIONS 

Game theory was founded in 1944 by Von Neumann 
and Morgenstern. The papers written by Nash in 1951 on 
the definition and existence of Equilibrium are the basis 
for  modern  non  cooperative  game  theory.  In  the  last  50 
years  game  theory  has  become  a  crucial  tool  for  the 
individuals  and 
analysis  of  strategic  behaviors  of 
competition among companies in oligopoly markets. For 
electricity markets, basic game “ingredients” are: 
Game:    is  a  set  of  rules  that  discipline  the  interactions 

among competitors; 

G ; 

Payoff:   for producer g is the producer surplus Sg
Strategy: for producer g is the way he chooses the offers 
that  may  bring  the  maximal  payoff  in  the 
market clearing; 
for  producer  g  is  the  solution  of  the  payoff 
maximization  problem  taking  into  account  the 
market  clearing  with  the  strategies  of  other 
producers fixed; 

Move:  

Nash Equilibrium:  
 

a  situation  in  which  no  producer  can  improve 
his  surplus  by  changing  his  strategy  while  the 
strategies of other producers are fixed.  

Let  sg be  the  strategy  of  producer  g,  GGGGg be  the  set  of 
the  producers  except  g  (g  ∪  GGGGg  =  GGGG     ),  sGGGGg     =  
{si, ∀i∈ GGGGg }: the strategy set of the competitors, ∏g (sg , 
sGGGGg     )  the  payoff  of  g  given  the  decisions  of  the 
competitors.  Then, {sg
 
∏ g (sg
 

*, ∀g} is Nash Equilibrium if:   

* )        ∀g∈GGGG        

* ) ≥∏ g (sg , sGGGGg

* ,  sGGGGg

(14) 

In  general,  equilibrium  can  be  attained  by  multi 
moves(iteration  search  algorithm,[4][10],[14])  of  the 
game  model  in  which  each  producer  solve  his  surplus 
maximization problem alternatively until no producer can 
improve  his/her  surplus  by  changing  his  strategy,  given 

that the strategies of other producers are fixed.

In  the  SFE  game  models,  each  producer  will  find  a 
linear optimal supply function to submit to the market to 
maximize  the  individual  producer  surplus.  According  to 
the  parameterization 
the  decision 
variables, three kinds of supply function models are used 
popularly in literature, which are listed as follows:  
−  SFE-intercept: the decision  variable is ag  while the  
 
     The supply function can be expressed as: 
 pg                        ∀g∈GGGG     

      og(pg) = ag+ bg
(15) 
−  SFE -slope: the decision variable is bg while the ag is  
 
      The supply function can be expressed as: 
     
m+ bg pg                 ∀g∈GGGG      
      og (pg) = ag
 
−  SFE-k parameter: the decision variable 

m (sg  = bg ) 

fixed as ag

(16) 

   

m

 

is  kg  and  

servers as a multiplier of the marginal cost (sg  = kg ) 

     The supply function can be expressed as: 
     
      og(pg) = kg (ag

m pg)        ∀g∈GGGG

Suppose  the  strategic  supply  functions  take  the 
intercept  parameterization  model.  By  applying  the  KKT 
conditions to the optimization problem (4) ~ (7), we can

B.  Quantity bidding equilibrium 
 

(30) 

This kind of game models includes the Cournot [14-
18] and  Stackelberg models [19-20]. The producers  will 
find the optimal quantity to submit to the market.  

Stackelberg  model  considers  leader  producers  who 
own  large  shares  of  the  system  capacity  and  are  able  to 
influence the market prices while the followers do not but 
can observe the quantity chosen by the leaders and select 
their  optimal  biddings.  This  model  can  be  defined  by  a 
backward  induction  in  which  the  leader  producer  would 
offer  his  quantities  first  and  the  followers  take  that  as 
given.  The  response  of  the  followers  can  be  anticipated 
by the leaders and on that basis the leaders would decide 
the quantity offered. 

In this paper, we discuss the Cournot model. 
The  Cournot  model  is  used  to  analyze  oligopoly 
markets  in  which  the  number  of  firms  is  small,  or  the 
marginal cost curve is ‘steep’ with respect to the demand 
and the size of the firms are relative similar. The decision 
variable is the quantity offered by each producer (sg = pg). 
For  the  maximization  problem  of  producer  g,  the  power 
quantities  offered  by  other  producers  are  assumed  as 
given values. The nodal price at the generator bus g is: 
T (µ+ –µ– )                  ∀g∈GGGG   
λg = vN – Jg

(37) 

This kind of game models includes the Bertrand [21] 
and  Forchheimer  [22].  The  two  models  respectively 
correspond  to  the  Cournot  and  Stackelberg  models;  the 
only  difference  is  that  in  the  former  two  models  the 
producers  compete  for  the  price  while  in  the  latter  two 
the producers compete for the quantity. As we discussed 
before,  under  no  network  constraints,  market  clearing 
price  is  determined  by  the  aggregate  demands.  Thus, 

since the producer will not accept negative surpluses, the 
price  bids  game  among  the  producers  will  compel  the 
producer’s  bid  down  to  the  marginal  cost  otherwise  it 
will be substituted by other competitors who can provide 
lower  prices,  given  the  condition  of  the  unlimited 
capacity  of  the  producers  (That  is  supported  by  the 
assumption that any firm can capture the entire market by 
pricing below others and can expand output to meet such 
demand [9]). If  we consider the network constraints and 
the  capacity  limits,  the  price  bidding  game  models  are 
impossible to be formulated in a mathematical way since 
prices are actually the byproducts of the market clearing, 
(8), and can not be determined by the producers ex ante. 

Therefore,  at  least  for  the  short-term  such  as  the 
hourly  dispatch  game  with  the  consideration  of  the 
network  constraints,  the  price  bidding  models  are  not 
suitable  for  the  electricity  markets  from  the  analytical 
point of view.

(36) and (37)), transformed into linear constraints due to 
the fact of that the line flow states are pre-specified. The 
complimentary term means that, for each line l, either the 
−   are equal to zero with the 
langrage multiplier µl
−  =  0)  is  a  positive 
line  flow  not  binding  or  the  µl

direction,  or  the  µl

Second ,for the SFE-intercept model, the sweeping of 
the line flow states is not efficient since the production of 
other  players  are  not  determined(only 
the  supply 
functions of the competitors  are assumed as fixed in the 
move  of  the  considered  player).  The  complementary 
equality  constraints  in  terms  of  the  production  limits  (6 
players, the production may be binding at the upper limit 
or lower limit or not binding, expressions (28) and (29)) 
and  lines  flows  limits  make  the  possible  states  of  the 
model  solution  equal  to  36*33,  which  is  a  too  large 
number to be solved by sweeping all the states space. In 
this  respect,  for  the  move  of  the  considered  player,  we 
first  find  a  good  start  point  by  using  the  heuristic 
optimization  approach  and  from  that  start  point  we  use 
the  analytical  approach  to  find  the  local  optima  around 
that point.  

Since the nodal prices may be different when the line 
is 
flows  are  binding, 
introduced  to  represent  the  market  clearing  price.  The 
market  clearing  price  under  constrained  network  can  be 

the  weighted  average  price 

expressed as: 
 
λ  = (Σg  pg λg + Σd qd λd) / (Σg  pg+Σd  qd)

We  want  to  point  out  the  impacts  of  the  physical 
network  constraints  on  the  market  performances  under 
strategic  biddings  of  the  producers  through  the  market 
inefficiency index, the Lerner index and the allocation of 
surpluses among market participants.  

Use  the  superscript  E  and  P  to  denote  the  market 
the  oligopoly  equilibrium  and  perfect 
results  at 
competition  equilibrium,  respectively.  Use  the  subscript 
u  to  denote  the  market  results  under  unconstrained 
network. For example:

The  IEEE30  bus  test  system  is  composed  with  6 
producers (at the 6 generator buses) and 20 consumers (at 
the 20 load buses), Fig. 2. The lines selected to consider 
the  network  constraints  are  shown  in  table  I,  other  lines 
are  assumed  to  have  infinitive  line  flow  limits.  The 
parameters of the generators and the load demand curves 
are illustrated with the table II and III.  

Perfect  competition  and  monopoly  represent  the  two 
extreme market structures, the market clearing results are 
illustrated with table IV and V. While in other models we 
assume that each generator is owned by one owner, in the 
monopoly case, the six generators are assumed as owned 
by  one  firm  aiming  at  maximizing  its  total  producer 
surplus,  deteriorating  the  market  performance  notably 
with  very  high values of σ (0.94), σu (0.89), ξ (-21.4%) 
and ξu

   (-20%).  

A  more  common  case  is  the  oligopoly  of  which  the 
equilibrium  is  in-between  the  two  preceding  cases.  The 
Cournot and the SFE-intercept game models are selected 
to  show  the  oligopoly  market  performances  under 
constrained  and  unconstrained  network,  the  market 
clearing results at the oligopoly equilibrium are shown in 
table  VI  and  VII. The  Cournot  model  has  higher  values 
of the Lerner index and higher values of the inefficiency 
index (absolute value) than the SFE-intercept model does, 
both under constrained and unconstrained network, Fig. 3 
and  4,  suggesting  the  Cournot  model  possesses  higher 
noncompetitive level than the SFE-intercept does. On the 
other  hand,  under  the  given  model,  with  higher  Lerner 
and  inefficiency  (absolute  value)  indices  values,  the 

constrained network brings higher level of market power 
than the unconstrained network does. 

the 

 Fig.  5  is  the  producer  surplus  for  Cournot  model. 
The  amount  of  extra  surplus  due  to  the  network 
constraints  (the  total  producer  surplus  under  constrained 
total  producer  surplus  under 
network  minus 
unconstrained network, 3928$–3395 $=533 $) goes to the 
producer  G22,  G23  and  G27,  especially  the  producer  G23 
takes  the  larger  part.  For  SFE-intercept  model,  Fig.  6, 
only producer G1 gets fewer surpluses under constrained 
network.  Furthermore,  Counot  model  contributes  to 
higher total producer surplus, and also  higher  individual 
producer  surplus,  than  SFE-intercept  model  does  both

under 
respectively,  and  under  unconstrained  network,  3395$ 
and 1835$ respectively.

and 

Unfortunately,  the  favorable  impacts  of  network 
constraints on the supply side are along with the adverse 
impacts  on  the  consumer  side.  The  total  consumer 
surplus is decreased from unconstrained network case to 
constrained network case, Fig.7, the decrement levels are 
respectively  14%  and  18.2%  under  Cournot  and  SFE-
intercept game models. 

Furthermore, under constrained network, although the 
market inefficiency indices of   Cournot model and SFE-
intercept  model  are  almost  the  same,  -6.8%  and  -6.4% 
respectively, it cannot say the two models have the same 
oligopoly  level.  Indeed,  the  main  effects  of  the  market 
power  behaviors  from 
the  supply  side  are  more 
remarkable  under  Cournot  model  with  higher  market 
clearing  price,  43.8$/MW  (38.5$/MW  under  SFE- 
intercept model), and lower exchanged power quantities, 
226MW  (246MW  under  SFE-intercept  model).  The  less 
G  )  with  the  more  total 
total  producer  surplus  (  ∑gSg
C    )  and  mechanize  surplus 
consumer  surplus(  ∑dSd
(  SM  )under  SFE-intercept  game  model  than  under 
Cournot  model,  table  VII  ,  results  in  the  two  models 
close  values  of  the  social  surplus(  SS )and  thus  the  close 
values of the inefficiency indices. 

Another point is that, under constrained network, the 
social  surplus  at  the  perfect  competition  equilibrium 
(10990 $, the last row of the table V) is even smaller than 
the social surplus value at the Cournot equilibrium under 
unconstrained  network  (11173$,  the  row  2  of  the  table 
VI).  Therefore,  to  strengthen  the  electricity  network 
letting it not to be congested is an imperative task that the 
market  regulator  should  monitor  continually,  from  the 
market efficiency point of view.

V. CONCLUSIONS 

For the specific features of the electricity industry, the 
present  electricity  markets  may  be  better  described  in 
terms  of  oligopoly  than  of  perfect  competition  from 
which  they  may  be  rather  far.  Game  theory  is  an 
appropriate  tool  to  model  electricity  markets  in  an 
oligopoly competitive environment.  

In  the  electricity  markets,  in  which  the  power 
transactions  are  undertaken  on  a  grid  that  needs  to  be 
operated under strict physical and operational constraints; 
for  this  reason  very  specific  occasions  of  market  power 
behaviors related to system congestion may arise, giving 
a further source of market inefficiency.  

Game 

to  represent 

theory  models  suitable 

the 
competitive  electricity  market  have  been  analyzed  and 
tested  using  the  IEEE30  bus  system.  The  simulations 
show  a  worsening  of  the  market  performance,  as 
measured by the inefficiency index and the Lerner index, 
when compared to the ideal model of perfect competition. 
Effects  generated  by  oligopoly  competition  are:  loss  in 
total  social  surplus,  increase  of  the  producer  surplus  at 
the  expenses  of  consumer  surplus,  decrease  in  the 
quantity exchanged on the market, higher market clearing 
price.  

The  loss  of  efficiency  with  respect  to  the  perfect 
competition may vary a lot from a model to another. This 
shows  that  the  type  of  competition  in  the  market  and/or 
the  hypothesis  we  do  to  model  it  may  lead  to  very 
different  results.  The  monopoly  model  shows  the  worst 
behavior,  both  under  constrained  and  unconstrained 
network.  As  for  the  oligopoly  market,  Counort  model 
show a worse performance than the SFE-intercept model, 
and  as  a  fact  that,  from  the  simulation  results  of  other 
least 
oligopoly  models,  Cournot  model  has 
and 
competitive 
unconstrained network.

Due  to  the  network  constraints,  the  transmission 
network  plays  a  major  role  to  determine  the  market 
equilibrium.  Under  constrained  network,  the  market 
clearing price is higher and the power transacted is lower 
than 
the  corresponding  values  under  unconstrained 
network.  As  for  the  surpluses  values,  the  network 
constraints  provide  some  producers  with  additional 
opportunity  to  get  higher  surplus  with  the  decrement  of 
the  consumer  surplus,  leading  to  the  higher  level  of 
market  inefficiency  compared  with  the  unconstrained 
network.  In  this  respect,  to  strengthen  the  electricity 
transmission  network  will  contribute  to  mitigate  the 
market power behaviors of the electricity producers.

Abstract 

In this paper the fields generated by an electric dipole and a gravitational quadrapole are 
shown to propagate superluminally in the nearfield of the source and reduce to the speed 
of light as the fields propagate into the farfield. A theoretical derivation of the generated 
fields  using  Maxwell’s  equations  is  presented  followed  by  a  theoretical  analysis  of  the 
phase  and  group  speed  of  the  propagating  fields.  This  theoretical  prediction  is  then 
verified by a numerical simulation which demonstrates the superluminal propagation of 
modulated  signals  in  the  nearfield  of  their  sources.  An  experiment  using  simple  dipole 
antennas  is  also  presented  which  verifies  the  theoretically  expected  superluminal 
propagation of transverse electromagnetic fields in the nearfield of the source. The phase 
speed, group speed, and information speed of these systems are compared and shown to 
differ. Provided the noise of a signal is small and the modulation method is known, it is 
shown  that  the  information  speed  can  be  approximately  the  same  as  the  superluminal 
group speed. According to relativity theory, it is known that  between  moving  reference 
frames,  superluminal  signals  can  propagate  backwards  in  time  enabling  violations  of 
causality. Several explanations are presented which may resolve this dilemma. 
 
Introduction 

The  electromagnetic  fields  generated  by  an  oscillating  electric  dipole  have  been 
theoretically  studied  by  many  researchers  using  Maxwell’s  equations.  Typical  analysis 
involves using potentials  and an arbitrary gauge equation which simplifies the resultant 
PDEs  so  that  they  can  be  simply  solved.    In  the  following  section,  an  analysis  of  the 
electric dipole is presented which solves the generated fields without the use of potentials 
and  a  gauge  equation.  The  results  show  the  same  field  solutions  as  presented  by  other 
authors but differ in that the electric field is shown to be generated only by the position of 
the  dipole  and  not  the  combination  of  the  dipole’s  position,  velocity  and  acceleration. 
Similarly the magnetic field is shown to be generated only by the velocity of the dipole 
and not the combination of the dipole’s, velocity and acceleration. Although the analysis 
presented below does not use potentials, the results are grouped in terms of potentials so 
that  the  results  can  be  easily  compared  to  the  analysis  presented  by  other  authors.  It 
should  be  noted  that  this  paper  is  a  summary  of  ongoing  research  done  by  the  author 
since  1990    [ref.  previous  authors  papers: 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9].  The  analysis  presented 
below is in (Gaussian units).

The Green’s function method can then be used to solve this PDE equation. This is done 
by setting source f(t) to a Dirac delta function and solving for the Green’s function (G) 
yielding:

This  equation  can  then  be  multiplied  by: 
The resultant equation can then be simplified using the Fourier Transform (Eq. 15) and 
using the known property:  ∫

Inserting  the  known  relation  for  the  Laplacian  operator  in  spherical  coordinates  and 
assuming spherical symmetry in the resultant propagating fields (i.e.  G  independent of 
θ and φ) yields:

Values  for  unknowns  (A  and  B)  can  then  be  determined  using  known  boundary 
conditions. As 
0→ω  then governing differential equation (Eq. 18) reduces to Poisson’s 
, 
equation  and  it’s  known  solution  (ref.  Ch.  1.7  [10]),  implying: 
yielding: A+B=-1/(4p). Using the radiation condition, where it is assumed that the fields 
only propagate away from the source yields: B=0. Consequently the resultant solution for

The  above  potentials  are  commonly  referred  to  in  the  literature  as  retarded  potentials,    
(ref. p.681 [12]). Note that although the fields (E, B) have been derived without the use of 
the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A), their solutions have been grouped using 
them, enabling comparison with other traditional derivations. Note that avoiding the use 
of  potentials  in  the  derivation  of  the  fields  eliminates  any  confusion  involved  in  using 
arbitrary gauge equations used to solve potential PDEs [2].

The  above  field  solutions  (Eq.  47,  52,  53)  are  the  same  as  those  presented  by  other 
authors [29, 12(ch 37.6)] but it is noted that they differ in that the magnetic field is shown 
to be generated only by the velocity of the dipole (Eq. 46) and not the combination of the 
dipole’s, velocity and acceleration. Similarly the electric field is shown to be generated 
only  by  the  position  of  the  dipole  (Eq.  50,  51)  and  not  the  combination  of  the  dipole’s 
position, velocity and acceleration. The above analysis shows that the real and imaginary 
components in the brackets (Eq. 47, 52, 53) causing the fields to deviate from the speed 
of light result from the Taylor expansion of the spatial part of the fields (Eq. 40)  and not 
due to time derivatives of the source as suggested by other authors.

propagates. The phase speed (cph) of an oscillating field of the form

It should be noted that other derivations of the above phase and group speed relations are 
available in previous publications by the author [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and in the following 
well-known reference [14]. In addition, in order for the group speed to be valid, a signal 
should not distort as it propagates. It is known from electronic signal theory that in order 
to minimize signal distortion, the phase vs. frequency curve must be approximately linear 
over  the  bandwidth  of  the  signal  and  the  amplitude  vs.  frequency  curve  must  be 
approximately constant over the bandwidth of the signal [15]. It is shown below that the 
amplitude  vs.  frequency  curve  can  even  be  approximately  linear  over  the  bandwidth  of 
the  signal,  provided  the  ratio  of  the  slope  of  the  curve  to  the  signal  amplitude  is  small 
[16 (p. 12)].  Assuming  that  the  amplitude  vs.  frequency  curve  is  increasing  and

magnitude  (A)  Fourier  component  (wm)  will  be  increased  by  (u)  and  the  Fourier 
component symmetric about the carrier (wc) will be reduced by (u):

(Eq.  67,  70,  73).  It  should  be  noted  that  these  relations  yield  the  same  results  as           
(Eq.  57,  62)  provided  the  phase  and  magnitude  vs.  frequency  curves  are  approximately 
linear over the bandwidth of the signal.

Wave propagation analysis of near-field electric dipole EM fields  

To determine how the EM fields propagate in an electric dipole system, one can apply the 
above phase and group speed relations (Eq. 57, 62) to the known theoretical solution of 
an electric dipole (Eq. 47, 52, 53).

The above results (p. 13, 14) were originally published by the author in 1999 [5], but the 
propagation of the longitudinal electric field and gravitational field next to a source was 
published  earlier  by  the  author  in  1997  [6,  7].  It  should  be  noted  that  after  these  dates 
similar results have been published by other authors [17, 18]. 
 
 
Animated field plots 

In  this  section,  animated  contour  plots  are  presented  which  show  how  the  longitudinal 
and  transverse  electric  fields  propagate.  A  cosinusoidal  dipole  source  is  used  and  the 
resultant  fields  are  assumed  to  be  a  vectoral  sum  of  all  the  wave  components.  The 
resultant  field  magnitude  and  phase  are  then  inserted  into  a  propagating  cosine  wave: 
Mag Cos(ωt + ph) and plotted at different moments in time. The plots are generated using 
Mathematica  Ver.  3  software.  The  code  generates  24  plots  evenly  spaced  within  a 
specified analysis period. Several of the resultant frames are shown below. The vertical 
dipole source is located in the center of the plots. The frames shown below (Fig. 18) are 
animated  plots  of  the  longitudinal  electric  field.  They  clearly  show  that  the  waves  are 
generated at the source and propagate away from the source.

Note  that  careful  inspection  of  the  plot  reveals  that  the  wavelength  of  the  transverse 
electric  field  in  the  near-field  (a)  is  larger  than  the  wavelength  in  the  far-field  (b).  The 
phase  speed  (cph)  is  known  to  be  a  function  of  wavelength  (λ)  and  frequency  (f):          
cph = λf. Solving the relation for (f), which is constant both in the near-field and farfield, 
yields: f = Cphnear / λnear = Cphfar / λfar. Solving this for Cphnear yields:          
Cphnear = Cphfar  (λnear / λfar).  Since  λnear > λ  far  the  phase  speed  of  the  transverse 
electric field in the nearfield is larger than the speed of light (cph > c). 
 
Graphical demonstration of superluminal phase and group speed 
 
Superluminal near-field phase speed of radial electric field 

To  demonstrate  the  superluminal  near-field  phase  velocity  of  the  longitudinal  electric 
field,  the  calculated  phase  and  amplitude  functions  can  be  inserted  into  a  cosine  signal 
and the field amplitude can then be plotted in the near field as a function of space (r) at 
several isolated moments in time (t), (Fig. 27). A field propagating at the speed of light 
(shown  as  a  dashed  line)  is  also  included  in  the  plot  for  reference.  The  following 
parameters  are  used  in  the  subsequent  plots:  1m  wavelength  (l),  300GHz  signal 
frequency (f), 3.3ns signal period (T). The following Mathematica code (Fig. 26) is used 
to generate these plots:

The longitudinal field (shown as a solid line in the plot above) is observed to propagate 
away from the source, which is located at r = 0. As it propagates away from the source, 
the oscillation amplitude decays rapidly (1/r3) near the source (r < l), and decreases more 
slowly (1/r2) in the farfield (r > l) (ref. Eq. 47, 52, 53). A field propagating at the speed 
of  light  (shown  as  a  dashed  line  in  the  plot  above)  is  also  included  in  the  plot  for 
reference. Both signals start together in phase. The longitudinal field is seen to propagate 
faster than the light signal initially when it is generated at the source. After propagating 
about  one  wavelength  the  longitudinal  electric  field  is  observed  to  slow  down  to  the 
speed of light, resulting in a final relative phase difference of 90 degrees. In order to see 
the effect more clearly the signals can be plotted with the amplitude part of the function 
set to unity (Fig. 28).

It is also instructive to plot the signals as a function of time (t) for several positions (r) 
away from the source (Fig 29). At the source (r = 0) both signals are observed to be in 
phase. Further away from the source the longitudinal field signal is observed to shift 90 
degrees, indicating that it arrives earlier in time. The plots shown below are normalized 
for  clarity,  but  it  should  be  noted  that  the  signals  have  the  same  form  even  if  the 
amplitude part of the function were included. The only difference is the vertical scaling 
of  the  plot.  From  these  plots  it  can  also  be  seen  that  the  longitudinal  field  propagates 
much faster than the speed of light near the source (r < l), and reduces to the speed of 
light at about one wavelength from the source (r @ l), resulting in a final relative phase 
difference of 90 degrees between the longitudinal field (shown as a solid line), and the 
field propagating at the speed of light (shown as dashed line).

Superluminal near-field group speed of radial electric field 

To demonstrate the superluminal near-field group propagation speed of the longitudinal 
field,  the  calculated  phase  and  amplitude  functions  can  be  inserted  into  the  spectral 
components of an amplitude modulated cosine signal, and the field amplitude can then be 
plotted  as  a  function  of  space  (r)  at  several  isolated  moments  in  time  (t),  (Fig.  31).  To 
demonstrate this technique the group propagation (shown as a solid line) is compared to 
the phase speed propagation (shown as a dashed line) of waves of the form:  Cos(kr - wt). 
Note that the phase component (kr) is independent of frequency. This result is known to 
produce group waves and phase waves that both propagate at the speed of light. This can

Plotting the signals as a function of time for several spatial positions from the source also 
shows that group and phase signals travel at the same speed and remain in phase as they 
propagate.

The superluminal near-field group propagation speed of the longitudinal electric field can 
also  be  demonstrated  in  the  same  way  as  in  the  above  example.  The  calculated  phase 
function  for  the  field  can  be  inserted  in  into  the  spectral  components  of  an  amplitude 
modulated cosine signal and the field amplitude (shown as a solid line in the plot below) 
can  then  be  plotted  as  a  function  of  space  (r)  at  several  isolated  moments  in  time  (t),     
(Fig. 34, 35). An amplitude modulated field propagating at the speed of light (shown as a 
dashed  line)  is  also  included  in  the  plot  for  reference  (envelope  propagates  at  speed  of 
light).  Note  that  for  this  reference  signal  both  the  phase  speed  and  the  group  speed  are 
equal to the speed of light (ref. Fig. 31, 32). The following mathematica code (Fig. 33) is 
used  to  generate  the  plots  below.  The  same  signal  parameters  used  in  the  previous 
example are used in the calculation.

The above plots show an amplitude modulated longitudinal field group packet (shown as 
a  solid  line)  propagating  away  from  the  source,  at  r = 0  (group  maxima  marked  by 
vertical arrow). A propagating speed of light group wave (shown as a dashed line) is also 
provided for reference. The group maxima of the amplitude modulated longitudinal field 
is  observed  to  propagate  to  the  right  side  of  the  plot  before  the  group  maxima  of  the 
speed of light wave. These series of plots clearly demonstrate that the longitudinal group 
wave  propagates  much  faster  than  the  speed  of  light  near  the  source  (r < lc).  After 
propagating about one carrier wavelength from the source (r @ lc) the modulation part of 
longitudinal field (envelope of solid line) reduces to the speed of light, resulting in a final 
relative  phase  difference  of  90  degrees  (relative  to  the  carrier  signal)  between  the 
longitudinal field, and the field propagating at the speed of light. 
 
It  is  also  very  instructive  to  plot  the  field  amplitude  of  the  amplitude  modulated 
longitudinal  wave  (shown  as  a  solid  line  in  plot  below)  as  a  function  of  time  (t),  for 
several  positions  away  from  the  source  (r),  (Fig.  36,  37).  As  before,  an  amplitude 
modulated  wave  traveling  with  light  speed  is  also  plotted  for  reference  (shown  as  a 
dashed line). At the source (r = 0) both signals are observed to be in phase. Further away 
from  the  source  the  modulated  longitudinal  field  signal  is  observed  to  shift  to  the  left, 
indicating that the modulation part of longitudinal field (envelope) arrives earlier in time. 
The plots shown below are normalized for clarity, but it should be noted that the signals 
have the same form even if the amplitude part of the function were included. The only 
difference  is  the  vertical  scaling  of  the  plot.  From  these  plots  it  can  be  seen  that  the 
modulation part of longitudinal field (envelope of solid line) propagates much faster than 
the  modulated  light  speed  signal  (envelope  of  dashed  line  propagates  at  speed  of  light) 
near the source (r < lc). After propagating about one carrier wavelength from the source 
(r @ lc) the modulation part of longitudinal field (envelope of solid line) reduces to the 
speed of light, resulting in a final relative phase difference of 90 degrees (relative to the 
carrier  signal)  between  the  longitudinal  field,  and  the  field  propagating  at  the  speed  of 
light.

The  first  frame  of  the  plot  shows  the  two  wave  groups  starting  in  phase  at  the  source       
(r  = 0).  The  following  frames  show  that  as  the  two  waves  propagate  away  from  the 
source,  the  group  maxima  (marked  by  a  vertical  arrow)  of  the  amplitude  modulated 
longitudinal  arrives  earlier  in  time  than  the  group  maxima  of  a  light  speed  amplitude 
modulated  signal,  thus  demonstrating  that  the  group  speed  of  an  amplitude  modulated 
longitudinal electrical field is much faster than the speed of light near the source (r < lc), 
and reduces to the speed of light after it has propagated about one wavelength from the 
source (r  @ lc), resulting in a final phase difference of 90 degrees. 
 
Interpretation of theoretical results 

The  above  theoretical  results  (ref.  Fig.  9 - 17)  suggest  that  longitudinal  electric  field 
waves  and  transverse  magnetic  field  waves  are  generated  at  the  dipole  source  and 
propagate  away.  Upon  creation,  the  waves  (phase  and  group)  travel  with  infinite  speed 
and then rapidly reduce to the speed of light after they propagate about one wavelength 
away from the source. In addition, transverse electric field waves (phase and group) are 
generated  approximately  one-quarter  wavelength  outside  the  source  and  propagate 
toward  and  away  from  the  source.  Upon  creation,  the  transverse  waves  travel  with 
infinite  speed.  The  outgoing  transverse  waves  reduce  to  the  speed  of  light  after  they 
propagate  about  one  wavelength  away  from  the  source.  The  inward  propagating 
transverse fields rapidly reduce to the speed of light and then rapidly increase to infinite 
speed as they travel into the source. In addition, the above results show that the transverse 
electrical  field  waves  are  generated  about  90  degrees  out  of  phase  with  respect  to  the 
longitudinal waves. In the near-field the outward propagating longitudinal waves and the 
inward  propagating  transverse  waves  combine  together  to  form  a  type  of  oscillating 
standing wave. Note that unlike a typical standing wave the outward and inward waves 
are completely different types of waves (longitudinal vs. transverse) and can be separated 
by proper orientation of a detecting antenna. In addition, it should also be noted that both 

21

the phase and group waves are not confined to one side of the speed of light boundary 
and propagate at speeds above and below the speed of light in specific regions from the 
source. 
 
The  mechanism  by  which  the  electromagntetic  near-field  waves  become  superluminal 
can  be  understood  by  noting  that  the  field  components  can  be  considered  rectangular 
vector  components  of  the  total  field  (Fig.  38).  For  example,  the  vector  diagram  for  the 
longitudinal electric field (ref. Eq. 56) is: 
 
              Fig. 38           Vector diagram for longitudinal electric field

From this vector diagram it can be seen that the phase of the longitudinal electric field is: 
θ = f - kr.  Also  it  can  be  seen  that  angle:  f = ArcTan[kr].  Combining  these  relations 
yields phase relation (Eq. 67): θ = ArcTan[kr] – kr. Note that for small (kr \ r << l) the 
angle  bisector:  B  = 1  Sin(kr) @ kr  has  about  the  same  length  as  vector  (kr).  Therefore 
when  the  (kr)  is  small  the  two  vector  components  add  together  to  form  a  longitudinal 
electric  field  vector  which  has  nearly  zero  phase.  Note  that  the  angle  bisector 
approximation is valid for several values of (kr) when (kr) is small. This result can also 
be seen by Taylor expanding the phase relation for small (kr) yielding:  
θ = kr – [kr + (kr)3/3 + O(kr)5] = (kr)3/3 + O(kr)5, where kr = wr/c. These results show that 
very  near  the  dipole  source  the  phase  of  the  longitudinal  electric  field  is  zero,  causing 
both the phase speed and the group speed to be infinite (ref. Eq. 57, 62). In the near-field 
the phase increases to (kr)3/3, causing the phase speed to be: c/(kr)2 (ref. Eq. 57) and the 
group  speed  to  be:  c/(kr)2/3  (ref.  Eq.  62).  In  the  far-field  the  phase  becomes:  p  -  kr, 
causing  both  the  phase  speed  and  the  group  speed  to  be  equal  to  the  speed  of  light        
(ref. Eq. 57, 62). The other components of the electromagnetic field (Eθ, Bf) can also be 
analyzed in the same way yielding similar results. 
 
Numerical verification of field component propagation 

To verify the predicted wave propagation effects, a numerical simulation was performed. 
The  simulation  consisted  of  extracting  the  transfer  function  from  the  various  field 
components  of  the  known  dipole  solution  (Eq.  47,  52,  53)  and  then  inverse  Fourier 
transforming (FT-1) the Fourier transform (FT) of a given signal multiplied by the dipole 
transfer function [19]:  Result Sig = FT-1 [ FT [Signal] x G ],  where  "Result Sig" is the 
resultant propagating signal as a function of time, and "G" is the transfer function of the 
wave propagation system. A simple amplitude modulated signal (300MHz carrier, 20MHz 
modulation),  generated  by  adding  together  two  sinusoidal  oscillations  (280MHz  and 
320MHz),  was  applied  as  an  input  signal.  The  simulations  yielded  propagating  signal-
versus-time  animations  as  a  function  of  distance  (r)  from  the  source.  To  compare  the 
resulting  simulations  to  theoretical  expectations,  a  propagating  modulation  envelope  of

the  AM  signal  was  superimposed:    Mod  =  Cos[wmt-(θ2-θ1)/2]    where  q1  and  q2  are  the 
theoretically  expected  phase  shifts  for  the  2  frequencies  used  to  create  the  AM  signal   
(Eq. 67, 70, 73). The results below show a very good match between theory and numerical 
simulation.

Er animations were generated using the above code and substituting the following known Er relations

Md=2*Abs[(1-I*(wc/c*r))/r^3]*Cos[wm*tn-(ph2-ph1)/2];    (* Theoretical cg plot *) 

Bφ animations were generated using the above code and substituting the following known Bφ relations 

h=y*(-(u*r)-I)*u/r^2*Exp[I*u*r];     (* FT [Signal] x G *) 
ph1=k1*r-ArcCos[-k1*r/Sqrt[1+(k1*r)^2]];    (* Bφ phase relation for f1 *) 
ph2=k2*r-ArcCos[-k2*r/Sqrt[1+(k2*r)^2]];    (* Bφ phase relation for f2 *) 
Md=2*Abs[(-(wc/c*r)-I)]*wc/c/r^2*Cos[wm*tn-(ph2-ph1)/2];     (* Theoretical cg plot *) 

To  check  the  simulator,  the  AM  signal  was  also  applied  to  a  light  propagating  system. 
The results yielded a 300 MHz carrier, 20 MHz modulated AM signal animation which 
linearly  increased  its  phase  shift  as  expected.  This  was  verified  by  substituting  the 
following known relations: 

h=y*Exp[I*u*r];     (* FT [Signal] x G *) 
Md=2*Cos[wm*tn-( k2*r - k1*r)/2];     (* Theoretical cg plot *) 

It should be noted that no signal distortion was observed in these simulations. This can be 
attributed to the fact that the phase and amplitude vs. frequency curves are approximately 
linear  over  the  bandwidth  of  the  signal  (∆f/fc  =  40/300  =  1/7.5).  The  use  of  linearity 
constraint  can  be  seen  to  be  justified  by  plotting  u2/A2  for  each  field  component  and 
noting that it is much less than one over the bandwidth of the signal (Eq. 65, Fig. 43-45).

Because  of  the  excellent  match  between  the  numerical  and  theoretical  methods,  the 
validity of both methods is confirmed in analyzing the propagation of simple signals in 
this system. Whereas the theoretical method enables the propagation of simple signals to 
be  clearly  understood,  the  numerical  solution  is  not  only  useful  in  verifying  the 
theoretical  results,  it  can  also  be  useful  in  understanding  the  propagation  of  more 
complex signals which may be difficult to analyze mathematically.

Experimental verification of Eθ solution 

A  simple  experimental  setup  (Fig.  49)  has  been  developed  to  qualitatively  verify  the 
transverse  electric  field  phase  vs.  distance  plot  predicted  from  standard  EM  theory      
(Fig.  12)  and  use  it  to  mathematically  determine  the  phase  speed  and  group  speed  vs. 
distance plots (Fig. 13, 14)

Oscilloscope 

The  experiment  setup  consists  of  a  high  frequency  UHF  FM  transmitter  (Hamtronics 
model no. TA451)1
 which generates a 437MHz (68.65cm wavelength), 2 watt sinusoidal 
electrical signal. The output of the transmitter is connected with a RG58 coaxial cable to 
a  vertical  dipole  antenna  designed  for  the  carrier  frequency  (model  no.  RA3126)2    The 
output of the transmitter is also connected to channel 1 of the input of a high frequency 
500MHz  digital  oscilloscope  (model  no.  HP54615B).  The  transmitter  output,  cable, 
antenna,  and  oscilloscope  input  all  have  50  Ohm  impedance  in  order  to  minimize 
reflections.  A  second  identical  receiver  dipole  antenna  is  connected  to  channel  2  of  the 
high  frequency  oscilloscope  and  the  antenna  is  positioned  parallel  to  the  vertical 
transmitting  antenna.  The  sinusoidal  signals  from  the  two  antennas  are  monitored  with 
the  oscilloscope,  triggered  to  channel  1.  The  phase  difference  between  the  signals  is 
measured  using  the  oscilloscope  measurement  cursors  as  the  antennas  are  moved  apart 
from  5  cm  to  70  cm  in  increments  of  5  cm  (measurements  made  with  a  ruler).  The 
oscilloscope  calculates  the  phase  from  the  measured  time  delay  (Dt)  and  the  measured 
wave period (T): qdeg = (360Dt)/T. The phase vs. distance data is analyzed using HPVEE 
(Ver. 4.01) PC software. The data is then curvefit with a 3rd order polynomial and the data 
is  superimposed  to  visually  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  curvefit.  The  phase  speed  vs. 
distance curve was then generated by differentiating the resultant curve fit equation with 
respect to space and using (Eq. 57). The group speed vs. distance curve was generated by 

 and inserting it into the relation (Eq. 61):  

using the differential relation:

Experimental results 

The following graph (ref. Fig. 51) is a plot of the phase vs. distance data (Fig. 50) taken 
during one experiment. The phase and group speed graphs were generated by curvefitting 
the experimental data and inserting the curvefit equation into the phase and group speed 
transformations:  (ref.  Eq.  57,  78).  The  first  data  point  is  not  real  and  was  added  to 
improve the polynomial curvefit. The curvefit yielded the following polynomial:

It  should  be  noted  that  these  experimental  results  are  only  qualitative  due  to  EM 
reflections  from  nearby  walls  and  objects.  Quantitative  measurements  can  only  be 
attained  in  an  anechoic  chamber.  The  experiment  has  been  repeated  several  times  in 
different parts of a 4 x 4m (area) x 2m (height) room at different angular orientations to 
the walls and the phase vs. distance curve always appears the same within 10%. It is also 
observed  that  changing  the  scope  input  impedance  from  50  Ohms  to  1M  Ohm  input 
impedance  does  not  noticeably  affect  the  phase  vs.  distance  curve.  Since  no  effect  is 
observed  it  is  concluded  that  the  Tx  antenna  to  Rx  antenna  variable  capacitance 
combined with the scope input impedance (thereby forming a high pass filter) is not the 
cause of the phase change. Experimentally it is observed that the electrical field near the 
source (less than 0.6 l) is at least an order of magnitude greater than electric field several 
wavelengths  away  from  the  source,  which  may  be  reflected.  It  is  concluded  that  the 
observed field near the source is predominantly due to near-field effects thereby making 

26

the observed results qualitatively reliable. The experimental results (Fig. 51, 52, 53) are 
qualitatively  similar  to  the  electric  dipole  solution  presented  (ref.  Fig.  12,  13,  14). 
Differences  between  experiment  and  the  theory  presented  can  be  attributed  to  EM 
reflections  and  also  to  the  fact  that  the  theoretical  model  for  a  real  dipole  antenna  is 
somewhat different from the simple electric dipole solution presented. 
 
Other wave propagation systems with similar superluminal behavior 
 
Magnetic dipole 

Theoretical analysis of a magnetic dipole reveals that the system is governed by the same 
partial  differential  equation  as  the  electric  dipole  with  the  E  and  B  fields  interchanged 
[20,  12].  The  resulting  fields  are  found  to  be  the  same  as  the  fields  generated  by  an 
electric dipole (Eq. 47, 52, 53) and therefore the phase speed and group speed of these 
fields are the same as (Eq. 67 - 75), except that the E and B fields are interchanged. 
 
 
Gravitational quadrapole
 
  It  is  known  that  for  weak  and  slowly  varying  gravitational  fields,  General  Relativity 
theory  reduces  to  a  form  of  Maxwell’s  equations.  In  this  limit,  Einstein’s  equation 
becomes linearized and reduces in MKS units to [21, 22, 9]:

Except for the source term, the partial differential equation of the potential is the same as 
that of an oscillating charge. Because of this similarity one can then use the oscillating 
charge solutions by simply substituting: εo = –1/(4πG). In addition, because momentum is 
conserved, a moving mass must push off another mass. The gravitational field generated 
by  the  secondary  mass  adds  to  the  gravitational  fields  generated  by  the  moving  mass, 
resulting in a linear quadrapole source. Although the problem can be solved using only 
the fields as was done for the dipole in the first part o this paper, simpler methods using 
the potentials can also be used. One method in particular requires only the scalar potential 
[23, 3]. The scalar potential for an electric quadrapole is known to be in MKS units [10]:

where  (E)  is  the  gravitational  force  vector  and  (B)  is  the  solenoidal  gravitational  force 
vector.  The  constant  (N)  can  be  determined  by  substituting  the  relations:  εo = –1/(4πG)

The phase and group speed relations for these fields can then be determined by using the 
phase  and  group  speed  equations  derived  earlier  in  the  paper  (Eq.  57,  62).  It  should  be 
noted that all of the plots look very similar to those of an electric dipole (ref. Fig. 9 - 17).

Total E field plots (linear quadrapole in center and vertical unless specified) 

Using vector field plot graphics in Mathematica software (ref. Fig. 22), the Er and Eθ can 
be combined and plotted as vectors (Fig. 66). A more detailed plot of the total E field can 
be  obtained  by  using  the  fact  that  a  line  element  crossed  with  the  electric  field  =  0        
(ref.  Eq.  76,  77).  A  contour  plot  (ref.  Fig.  24)  of  the  resulting  relation  yields  the  total       
E field plots below (Fig. 67, 68).

Experimental evidence of superluminal gravitational fields 
 
Evidence  of  near-infinite  gravitational  phase  speed  at  nearly  zero  frequency  has  been 
observed by a few researchers by noting the high stability of the earth’s orbit about the 
sun  [24,  25].  Light  from  the  sun  is  not  observed  to  be  collinear  with  the  sun’s 
gravitational force. Astronomical studies indicate that the earth’s acceleration is towards 
the gravitational center of the sun even though it is moving around the sun, whereas light 
from the sun is observed to be aberated. If the gravitational force between the sun and the 
earth were aberated then gravitational forces tangential to the earth’s orbit would result, 
causing the earth to spiral away from the sun, due to conservation of angular momentum. 
Current astronomical observations estimate the phase speed of gravity to be greater than 
2x1010c.  Arguments  against  the  superluminal  interpretation  have  appeared  in  the 
literature [26, 27] 
 
Information speed 

If  an  amplitude-modulated  signal  propagates  a  distance  (d)  in  time  (t),  then  the 
information contained in the modulation propagates at a speed: 

cinf  = d/(t+T)                                                             (95) 

where (T) is the amount of time the modulated signal must pass by the detector in order 
for  the  information  to  be  determined.  The  information  in  the  wave  is  determined  by 
measuring the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the wave modulation envelope.  
 
If  a  wave  is  propagated  across  distances  in  the  farfield  of  the  source,  then  the  wave 
information  speed  is  approximately  the  same  as  the  wave  group  speed.  This  is  because 
the wave propagation time (t) is much greater than the wave information scanning time 
(T), consequently:

In the nearfield of the source, if nothing is known about the type of modulation, then the 
scanning time (T) can be much larger than the wave propagation time (t), thereby making 
the  wave  information  speed  much  less  than  the  wave  group  speed.  This  can  be 
understood by noting that several modulation cycles are required for a Fourier analyzer to 
be  able  to  determine  the  wave  modulation  amplitude,  frequency,  and  phase.  But  if  the 
type of modulation is known, then only a few points of the modulated signal need to be 
sampled  by  a  detector  in  order  to  curve  fit  the  signal  and  therefore  determine  the 
modulation information. If the noise in the signal is very small then the signal scanning 
time  (T)  can  be  made  much  smaller  than  the signal  propagation  time  (t),  consequently:   
cinf ~ d/t = cg . 
 
Numerical evidence that information can be extracted in periods much smaller than a 
modulation wavelength 

A  numeric  simulation  was  developed  using  Methematica  Ver.  3  software  (Fig.  70)  to 
determine if the information contained in an AM signal can be extracted in a period much 
smaller  than  a  modulation  wavelength.  To  demonstrate  this,  an  AM  signal  was 
theoretically specified:

The  signal  was  then  digitized  and  the  resultant  data  curvefitted,  specifying  only  the 
carrier frequency (wc=10) and the modulation frequency (wm=1). The curvefit was able to 
determine  the  unknown  modulation  amplitude  given  only  a  few  data  points  in  a  region 
much smaller than the modulation wavelength.

Relativistic consequences 

According to the relativistic Lorentz time transform (Eq. 98), if an information signal can 
propagate at a speed (w) faster than the speed of light (c), then the signal can be reflected 
by a moving frame (v) located a distance (L) away and the signal will arrive before the 
signal  was  transmitted  (∆t´ < 0).  Since  the  information  in  the  signal  can  be  used  to 
prevent the signal from being transmitted, this results in a logical contradiction (violation 
of causality). How can the signal be detected if it was never transmitted? Consequently, 
Einstein  in  1907  stated  that  superluminal  signal  velocities  are  incompatible  with 
Relativity theory [28].

Because  Relativity  theory  predicts  that  a  moving  reflector  (which  has  mass)  can  never 
move  faster  than  light  (v  <  c),  then  in  order  for  (∆t´  >  0)  the  signal  propagation  speed 
must be less than the speed of light (w<c).  
 
Arguments against the superluminal interpretation 

Some  physicists  have  proposed  that  a  dipole  source  generates  position,  velocity,  and 
acceleration-dependent propagating fields, each of which propagates at the speed of light 
[29, 26, 27]. It is argued that the interference of these field components gives the illusion 
that they propagate superluminally. In the first section of this paper, the electromagnetic 
fields generated by a dipole source were derived from Maxwell’s equations without the 
use  of  potentials  or  gauge  equations.  The  results  show  the  same  field  solutions  as 
presented by other authors (Eq. 47, 52, 53) but differ in that the electric field is shown to 
be generated only by the position of the dipole and not the combination of the dipole’s 
position, velocity and acceleration (Eq. 52, 53). Similarly the magnetic field is shown to 
be generated only by the velocity of the dipole and not the combination of the dipole’s,

velocity and acceleration (Eq. 47). It is shown that the real and imaginary components of 
the fields are due to the Taylor expansions of the spatial part of the fields (Eq. 40) and not 
due to time derivatives of the source as suggested by other authors.  
 
Another common argument mentioned by some physicists is that a source impulse yields 
an impulse propagating at the speed of light. Referring to the expression for the retarded 
potentials  (Eq.  35),  one  can  see  that  the  potentials  are  expressed  in  terms  of  source 
position  (R).  But  conversion  to  the  origin  coordinate  (r)  yields  a  very  different  result, 
which is dispersive in the nearfield (ref. Eq. 43 with higher order terms in ξ included). In 
addition the fields, which are what are measurable yield even more dispersive results (ref. 
Eq. 49, 56, 57), where the effects are observed to the zeroth order in  ξ. This indicates 
that an impulse will distort as it propagates in the nearfield, and reduces to the speed of 
light in the farfield since the higher order terms decay more rapidly in the farfield [ref. 
argument corresponding to (Fig. 38), and also (ref. Fig. 9, 12, 15) showing:  q = f(w) for 
given r].  
 
Some  physics  accept  that  phase  velocity  and  group  velocity  in  these  systems  can  be 
superluminal  but  that  the  information  speed  is  less  than  the  speed  of  light.  It  has  been 
shown  in  this  paper  that  although  group  speed  can  differ  from  information  speed, 
provided the noise is small and the method of modulation is known, group speed can be 
approximately  the  same  as  the  information  speed  (ref.  section  corresponding  to           
Eqn. 95 - 97). It is also commonly stated by physicists that the front speed (speed of a 
field step function or impulse) is limited to the speed of light. In the above paragraph it 
has been argued that an impulse changes shape as it propagates, and therefore it can not 
be used to determine the speed of the field in the nearfield. The analysis in this paper has 
shown that in order for signals to propagate without much dispersion, the signals must be 
narrowband,  such  as  provided  by  conventional  AM,  FM,  PM  modulations  (ref.  Group 
speed  analysis  section  corresponding  to  Eq.  62  -  66).  This  is  because  the  phase  vs. 
frequency curve must be linear over the bandwidth of the signal. Because impulses and 
step  functions  are  broadband  signals,  different  frequency  components  will  propagate  at 
different speeds resulting in signal distortion.  
 
Conclusion 

The analysis presented in this paper has shown that the fields generated by an electric or 
magnetic dipole, and also the gravitational fields generated by a quadrapole mass source, 
propagate superluminally in the nearfield of the source and reduce to the speed of light as 
they propagate into the farfield. The group speed of the waves produced by these systems 
has also been shown to be superluminal in the nearfield. Although information speed can 
be  less  than  group  speed  in  the  nearfield,  it  has  been  shown  that  if  the  method  of 
modulation  is  known  and  provided  the  noise  of  the  signal  is  small  enough,  the 
information  can  be  extracted  in  a  time  period  much  smaller  than  the  wave  propagation 
time. This would therefore result in information speeds only slightly less than the group 
speed which has been shown to be superluminal in the nearfield of the source. It has also 
been shown that Relativity theory predicts that if an information signal can be propagated 
superluminally, then it can be reflected by a moving frame and arrive at the source before 
the information was transmitted, thereby enabling causality to be violated.

Given these results, it is at present unclear how to resolve this dilemma. Relativity theory 
could be incorrect, or perhaps it is correct and information can be sent backwards in time. 
Perhaps as suggested by the ‘Hawking chronology protection conjecture’ [30], nature will 
intervene in any attempt to use the information to change the past. Therefore information 
can  be  propagated  backwards  in  time  but  it  cannot  be  used  to  change  the  past,  thereby 
preserving  causality.  Another  possibility  is  that  according  to  the  ‘many-worlds’ 
interpretation  of  quantum  mechanics  [31],  multiple  universes  are  created  any  time  an 
event  with  several  possible  outcomes  takes  place.  If  this  interpretation  is  correct,  then 
information can be transmitted into the past of alternative universes, thereby preserving 
the past of the universe from which the signal was transmitted. 
 
In  addition  to  the  theoretical  implications  of  the  research  discussed  above,  it  may  also 
have  practical  applications,  such  as  increasing  the  speed  of  electronic  systems  that  will 
soon be limited by light-speed-time delays. It should also be possible to reduce the time 
delays inherent in current astronomical observations by monitoring lower frequency EM 
and  eventually  gravitational  radiation  from  these  sources.  Lastly,  using  low  frequency 
EM transmissions, it should be possible to reduce the long communication time delays to 
spacecraft.

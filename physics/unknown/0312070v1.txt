Abstract—Multichip  modules  (MCM)  with  4  single  photon 
counting MPEC 2.3 chips bump bonded to 1.3 cm x 1.3 cm large 
CdTe and Si semiconductor sensors as well as to single chip pixel 
detectors have been successfully built and operated.  

The  MPEC  2.3  chip  provides  a  pixel  count  rate  up  to  1  MHz 
with  a  large  dynamic  range  of  18  bit,  2  counters  and  energy 
windowing with continuously adjustable thresholds. Each MPEC 
has 32 x 32 pixels of 200 µm x 200 µm pixel size. For a MCM the 
4  chips  are  arranged  in  a  2  x  2  array  which  leads  to  a  64  x  64 
sensor  pixel  geometry.  The  MCM  construction  is  described,  and 
the  imaging  performance  of  the  different  detectors  is  shown.  As 
readout system a newly developed USB system has been used.  

I.  INTRODUCTION 

S 

ingle  photon  counting  with  hybrid  pixel  detectors  has 
been  introduced  as  a  suitable  method  for  direct  digital 
imaging  [1],  [2].  Advantageous  for  a  hybrid  pixel  detector  is 
the variable use of different semiconductors as sensor material. 
As  Si  is  a  well  understood  semiconductor  and  homogeneous 
large  Si  wafers  are  easily  available,  Si  is  the  preferred  sensor 
material for applications where a high flux of ionizing radiation 
is used, e.g. material science or protein crystallography [3]-[8].  
On the other hand, the low atomic number Z=14 of Si leads 
to a low absorption efficiency for X-rays with energies higher 
than a few 10 keV. This is not acceptable in low-dose medical 
imaging applications or hard X-ray and γ-ray astronomy. Thus, 
high  Z-materials  like  GaAs  (Z=31/33)  were  studied  [9]-[11] 
and  a  very  promising  material  for  high  absorption  sensors  is 
CdTe (Z=48/52). The absorption efficiency of an only 0.5mm 
thick  CdTe  sensor  is  90%  and  30%  for  X-ray  energies  of  40

keV and 100 keV, respectively. In addition, progress could be 
obtained in wafer production and electrode design so that high 
quality  sensors  with  excellent  spectroscopic  performance  are 
available  [12]-[19].  As  the  connection  of  the  readout  chip  to 
the fragile CdTe material is difficult, a sophisticated gold stud 
bump bond process was developed at ISAS (Institute of space 
and  astronautical  science,  Japan)  and  a  0.5  mm  thick  CdTe 
sensor  could  be  successfully  bonded  and  operated  with  a 
previous version of the MPEC chip [20].  

In  order  to  use  single  photon  counting  detector systems for 
imaging  applications,  it  is  necessary  to  cover  a  large  imaging 
plane which is achieved with multichip modules (MCM). This 
means that several readout chips are bump bonded to a single 
large sensor. In this work an arrangement of a square geometry 
with 2 x 2 MPEC chips was chosen and systems with a Si and a 
CdTe sensor each of those covering an active detection area of 
about 13 mm x 13 mm were successfully built and operated. 

In  this  paper  we  present  the  MPEC  2.3  chip  and  report  on 
studies  with  Si  sensor  MCMs  and  for  the  first  time  on 
measurements  with  single  photon  counting  CdTe  sensor 
MCMs.  

II.  PIXEL DETECTOR DESCRIPTION 

A.  Readout chip 
The  MPEC  2.3  chip  is  a  single  photon  counting  pixel  chip 
with  1  MHz  high-count rate capability and energy windowing 
for photon energy discrimination. The active area of 6.4 mm x 
6.4 mm is structured into 32 x 32 pixels of 200 µm x 200 µm 
size. Every pixel cell contains a preamplifier, two independent 
discriminators,  and  two  18  bit  counters  (Fig.  1).  A  coarse 
discriminator  threshold  is  set  globally,  and  a  fine  adjustment 
can  be  applied  dynamically  for  each  pixel.  As  both 
discriminators work independently from each other, an energy 
window can be set which can be useful in medical imaging for 
contrast enhancement [21]. The MPEC 2.3 chip is based on the 
MPEC 2.1 chip [22], and some crucial parts of the chip layout 
register,  multiplexer,

Unfortunately, this process offers only two metal layers which 
makes  an  efficient  shielding  between  the  digital  part  and  the 
analog part of the chip difficult. 

200 µm x 450 µm was chosen (quad pixel: 450 µm x 450 µm). 
Algebraically,  the  gap  between  the  readout  chips  should  be 
400 µm (450 µm for the CdTe module), but as the readout chip 
has  a  surrounding  margin,  the  effective  gap  between  adjacent 
readout  chips  is  only  about  200  µm  making  MCM  bump 
bonding challenging.

B.  The sensors 
For the presented measurements single chip sensors as well 
as MCM sensors were used. The 280 µm thick Si sensors are 
high resistance p+ on n sensors operated in diode configuration 
and  the  connection  to  the  MPEC  2.3  chips  is  achieved  by  a 
wafer  level  solder  bump  bond  process  at  IZM  (Fraunhofer 
Institut  für  Zuverlässigkeit  und  Mikrointegration,  Berlin, 
Germany)  [23].  The  p+  electrode  is  structured  into  the 
corresponding  number  of  pixels  of  the  readout  chip,  and  all 
pixels are surrounded by a guard ring of 200 µm width.  

The  0.5  mm  thick  high  resistance  CdTe  sensors  were 
fabricated  by ACRORAD, Japan, and the detector assembling 
was done by ISAS. Both sides of the ohmic detectors are plated 
with Pt electrodes, and the side connected to the readout chip is 
structured into the corresponding number of pixels. Again, all 
pixels are surrounded by a guard ring of 200µm width. For the 
chip  sensor  connection  a  special  gold  stud  bump  bond 
technique in combination with an epoxy resin was used. More 
details  of 
sophisticated  bonding  procedure  and 
characteristics of the used CdTe can be found in [20].  

this 

A  critical  issue  for  building  MCM  is  the  handling  of  the 
spacing  between  the  readout  chips  (inter  chip  region).  The 
readout  chips  have  to  be  designed  in  a  way  that  they  are 
buttable  at  least  at  three  sides,  i.e.  wire  bond  pads  should  be 
only  on  one  chip  side.  Also,  the  sensor  pixels  which  are 
connected to the corresponding pixels at the inner edges of the 
readout  chips  have  to  be  larger  than  the  normal  pixel  size 
because  some  additional  space  between  the  readout  chips  is 
required.  Therefore,  these  pixels  have  a  double  side  length  in 
one direction leading to an area twice as large as the area of a 
normal pixel ("double pixel"). The four pixels in the center of 
the sensor have the double side length in both directions, thus, 
having  a  four 
larger  area  ("quad  pixel").  The 
arrangement  of  double  and  quad  pixels  can  be  seen 
schematically in Fig. 2. For the Si sensor a double pixel has a 
size  of  200  µm  x  400  µm  (quad  pixel:  400  µm  x  400  µm) 
whereas  for  the  CdTe  sensor  a  double  pixel  geometry  of

C.  Readout system 
All measurements with single chip detectors and with MCMs 
were done with a newly developed USB-based data acquisition 
system (s. Fig. 3).

This small and handy system is controlled only by a laptop 
computer and is easily transported and set up. The detector can 
be self-powered by the USB-line, and with a battery stack for 
the detector depletion voltage the whole system is independent 
of any external power supply. Fig. 4 shows the compact stack 
arrangement  of  3  PCBs.  On  the  bottom  the  USB  device 
controller card is placed performing the data exchange between 

 

 

  
 

 
 

shielding could not be achieved in the AMS 0.8µm technology 
where only two metal layers are available. 

 An important characteristic for the imaging performance of 
a photon counting chip is a low dispersion of the thresholds of 
all pixels in order to precisely setting energy cuts. In the case 
of the MPEC 2.3 chip both thresholds of a single pixel can be 
independently  adjusted  by  storing  a  correction  voltage  on  a 
capacitor  in  each  pixel.  As  a  result,  the  RMS-value  of  the 
threshold dispersion without sensor could be reduced from 180 
e for the unadjusted case to 10 e for the adjusted case (Fig. 6 
threshold  dispersion  could  already  be 
and  7).  A 
demonstrated  with  the  MPEC  2.1  in  [22].  However,  the outer 
columns of the MPEC 2.1 chip did not work properly whereas 
this problem is eliminated for the MPEC 2.3.

with  another  ceramic  plate  (s.  Fig.  5).  The  use  of  ceramic 
material  ensures  a  good  match  of  the  thermal  expansion

III.  MEASUREMENTS WITH SINGLE CHIP DETECTORS 

A.  Thresholds 
The MPEC 2.3 is a low noise ASIC whose equivalent noise 
charge (ENC) is measured to be about 60 e without sensor and 
about  110  e  with  additional  input  capacitance  of  the  sensor. 
The minimum threshold can be set to about 1300 e. This high 
threshold has to be set to avoid digital analog cross talk and is 
not in contradiction to the low noise performance of the chip. 
The  digital  switching  noise  couples  via  the  chip  bulk  and  the 
sensor into the preamplifier and would cause false signals if the 
threshold is not high enough. As mentioned earlier, an effective

Threshold [e]

 
Fig.  7.    Dispersion  of  adjusted  lower  and  upper  thresholds  of  MPEC2.3 

(without sensor).  

 
As  the  threshold  adjustment  is  done  dynamically,  the 
correction voltage needs to be refreshed. In order to minimize 
the  refresh  rate,  a  threshold  drift  compensation  circuit  was 

 

 

 

 

developed  reducing  the  drift  current  from  the  capacitor  [22]. 
As an example, the measured drift of the lower threshold of the 
32 pixels of one column is shown in Fig. 8. At the beginning of 
the  measurement  the  thresholds  were  set  to  3000  ±  10  e  and 
then  were  measured  every  2  minutes.  It  turns  out  that  the 
maximum drift rate is < 0.2 e/s so that only one fine adjustment 
cycle is needed for a typical detector exposure time.  

Also, a relatively good bump yield can be seen from Fig. 9. 
Apart  the  periphery  of  the  chip  only  a  few  pixels  are  not 
successfully  connected  to  the  sensor.  An  example  for  a 
radiograph  of  a  low  absorbing  object  shows  Fig.  10,  where  a 
mosquito is exposed to 6 keV photons of 55Fe.

B.  Imaging 
The digital analog cross talk limiting the threshold settings is 
not only caused by the counter flip-flops of a pixel cell but also 
by the switching noise of digital control lines. The influence of

A  flat  field  image  taken  with  a  CdTe  sensor  is  depicted  in

gold  stud  bump  bonding.  However,  in  the  flat  field  image  a 
column  pattern  of  the  count  rate  distribution  becomes  visible. 
As  the  CdTe  sensor  is  symmetric  row-  and  column-wise,  this

combination with the gold studs arrangement which indeed has 
a  column  dependence.  The  exact  origin  of  this  non-uniform

IV.  MEASUREMENTS WITH MULTI CHIP MODULES  

A.  Si sensor MCM and CdTe sensor MCM 
Available  bump  bonding  techniques  for  MCM  construction 
are wafer level processes based on In or PbSn bumps, and with 
these  methods  Si  sensor  MCMs  for  high  energy  physics 
experiments  have  been  successfully  built  [23-26].  For  the  Si 
sensor  MCM  described  in  this  work  a  PbSn  bump  bonding 
process was used. As the MPEC 2.3 chips were only available 
as  single  dies,  the  MPEC  chips  had  to  be  inserted  into  a 
dummy  wafer,  in  which  an  exactly  matched  opening  was  cut 
before.  After  wafer  processing the chips were removed out of 
the  dummy  wafer  again  and  cleaned  along  their  edges. 
Although this whole procedure degraded the bump yield along 
the chip edges, the built Si sensor MCM could be successfully 
operated.  

For  future  biomedical  applications  the  challenge  is to build 
MCMs with large area CdTe sensors. In contrast to the above 
mentioned techniques the CdTe sensor MCM is bump bonded 
by  a  gold  stud  process.  This  process  does  not  require  a  full 
wafer but can be done with single chip dies. A flat field image 
taken with a CdTe MCM is shown by Fig. 14.

It  can  be  seen  that  along  the  two  axes  of  the  module  many 
defect  pixels  exist.  These  defect  pixels  have  either  a 
completely vanishing or a very low count rate. Here, a possible 
explanation  is  a  break  of  the  detector  along  the  two  axes 
damaging the electrodes of the adjacent pixels. If a part of the 
broken  electrode  is  still  connected  to  the  readout  pixel,  the 
measured  count  rate  is  reduced  according  to  the  reduced 
electrode size. A break of the CdTe is not unlikely because the 
very  fragile  0.5  mm  thick  sensor  is  mechanically  stressed 
during  bump  bonding  to  the  readout  chips  and  during  wire 
bonding  to  the  hybrid  PCB.  But  it  should  be  stated  that  all 
other  regions  of  the  MCM  show  a  very  good  bump  yield. On 
the other hand, the column pattern in the count rate distribution 
can be recognized again which was already observed with the 
CdTe single chip detector described above. An example of the 
imaging performance of the CdTe sensor MCM is presented in 
Fig. 15 showing the radiograph of a cogwheel.

V.  SUMMARY 

The MPEC 2.3 chip could successfully characterized as low 
noise single photon counting read out chip for pixel detectors. 
By  dynamically  adjusting  the  thresholds  a  very  low  threshold 
dispersion could be achieved. A single chip Si detector of 300 
µm thickness and a single CdTe detector of 500 µm thickness 
were  assembled  and  operated.  In  addition  a  Si  sensor  MCM 
and  for  the  first  time  a  photon  counting  MCM  with  a  CdTe 
sensor were built. Both, solder bump bonding for the Si sensors 
and  gold  stud  bump  bonding  for  the  CdTe  sensors  were 
utilized. 

The solder bump bonding is a wafer level based process for 
which  the  single  diced  MPEC  chips  have  to  be  inserted  into 
dummy wafers. The gold stud bump bonding shows especially 
in  the  case  of  a  single  chip  detector  a  very  good  bump  yield. 
But  it  also  should  be  noted  that  the  imaging  performance  is 
somehow  affected  by  a  column  dependent  count  rate 
distribution.  As  for  the  assembling  of  the  CdTe  sensor  MCM 
special care must be taken when applying mechanical forces to 
avoid a break of the thin sensor. 

All  measurements  were  performed  with  a  newly  developed 
USB based readout system. Its compact size and self-powering 
possibility makes the whole system easy to use and versatile for 
different applications.

With an active silicon area of more than 200 m2, the silicon strip tracker of the CMS experi-
ment, one of the experiments currently under construction for the future Large Hadron Collider at

CERN, will be by far the largest silicon tracker in the world. Efﬁcient mass production and rigid
quality control are crucial to ﬁnish the detector, comprising of more than 15000 silicon strip mod-
ules, in time with optimal quality. After excellent performance of substructures has been proven
in various test beam experiments, integration of the active detector elements into the mechanical
support structures as well as cabling and testing of these integrated structures has now started.

In this article the CMS silicon strip tracker is described. Production, quality control and integra-
tion procedures are outlined and the detector status is reviewed. The detector performance in a
recent test beam experiment is summarized.

The CMS Silicon Strip Tracker - Overview and Status

1. The CMS Silicon Strip Tracker

With its more than 15000 silicon modules and a total active detector area of about 200 m 2, the
CMS Silicon Strip Tracker [1, 2] will be the largest silicon tracker ever built. The tracker will have
a length of 5.4 m and a diameter of 2.4 m. It will be operated at a temperature of below (cid:0) 10 (cid:1) C.
The active detector elements, the silicon modules, consist of four main parts: a support frame,
a Kapton strip which delivers the bias voltage to the sensor back plane and insulates the sensor
against the frame, the hybrid with the front-end electronics, and one or two silicon sensors [3].
The sensors are single-sided microstrip detectors with AC-coupled p-type strips in an n-type bulk.
Modules mounted with a radial distance of less (more) than 60 cm from the beam line have 320 m m
(500 m m) thick sensors. More than 20 different module geometries exist, with strip pitches ranging
from 80 m m to 205 m m. Both single-sided and double-sided modules (two single-sided modules
mounted back to back with a stereo angle of 100 mrad) are used.
A cross-section of one quarter of the detector is shown in Fig. 1. The detector is composed of
four basic subdetectors. The inner barrel, TIB, consists of four cylindrical layers, with strings
of three thin modules mounted inside and outside of the layer half-shells. The inner disks, TID,
are composed out of three disks per side, with three rings of modules per disk. The outer barrel,
TOB, is constructed out of six cylindrical layers. The basic substructure of the TOB is a rod: a
carbon ﬁber (CF) support frame, which carries either three double-sided or three single-sided thick
modules on each side. Finally, each of the two end caps (TECs) consists of nine CF disks. The
basic substructure of the TEC is a petal, a wedge shaped CF support plate which carries up to 28
modules arranged in up to seven radial rings. On each disk eight front and eight back petals (which
are of slightly different geometry and carry different numbers of modules) are mounted.
The signals of the 512 or 768 silicon strips of a module are processed by four or six APV25
readout chips [4] that are mounted on the front-end hybrid (FE-hybrid) [5]. The APV25 is built in
radiation hard 0.25 m m CMOS technology. It is a 128 channel chip which samples at a frequency
of 40 MHz and implements a charge-sensitive ampliﬁer with a time constant of 50 ns, a shaper and
a pipeline memory. After arrival of a ﬁrst level trigger the signals are processed by an analogue
circuit, for which two operation modes can be chosen: in peak mode only one data sample is used,
while in deconvolution mode three consecutive data samples are reweighted and summed up [6],
which leads to a much shorter pulse and thus to correct bunch crossing identiﬁcation in the high
luminosity running phase of the LHC. The signals of two chips are multiplexed onto one data line.
The electrical signals are then converted to optical signals in dedicated Analog-Opto Hybrids, and
transmitted to the counting room, where they are digitized and processed by 10 bit ADCs.

2. The Status of the CMS Silicon Strip Tracker

In this chapter, the status of the tracker as of July 2005 is described.

In the past, several problems had to be faced with two important module components, the silicon
sensors and the FE-hybrids. The 24244 sensors are delivered by two companies, ST Microelec-
tronics (STM) (Catania, Italy) and Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (HPK) (Hamamatsu-City, Japan),
to ﬁ ve quality control centers. There 5% of all sensors plus all sensors from suspicious batches
are characterized in detail, with all important sensor parameters such as the interstrip capacitance

and depletion voltage being measured. Furthermore 1% of the sensors are subjected to irradiation
tests with neutrons and protons to monitor the sensor processing quality. In addition the longterm
behaviour of several per cent of sensors is studied. This elaborate quality control reveiled several
ﬂaws (unstable leakage current, oxidation) of the sensors of STM. In reaction to this the bulk of the
production was shifted to HPK to assure the high quality of the modules. As of July 2005, all thin
and about 85% of the thick sensors are delivered and qualiﬁed.
For the FE-hybrids, two companies are involved:
the ﬂex circuits are produced by Cicorel SA
(Boudry, Switzerland), the components are assembled at Hybrid SA (Chez-le-Bart, Switzerland).
The hybrids are tested directly at the company with a fast test, and later at CERN prior to the bond-
ing. Several severe problems have been spotted, e.g. in certain batches thin vias developed a bad
electrical contact. This problem was solved by an improved production process. About 400 good
hybrids are delivered per week, and 70% of all hybrids have been delivered and accepted.
The modules themselves are glued with a precision of a few tens of microns on six fully automatic
pick-and-place robots. Up to 20 modules can be glued per robot per day, and 99% of the modules
built are within speciﬁcation. The modules are then wire bonded using more than 20 automatic
bonding machines with a throughput of more then ﬁ ve modules per day and machine. The module
quality is excellent, with a few per mille of bad strips. About 35% of modules are built.
The modules are then integrated onto the petal and rod structures (or, in the case of the TIB, directly
onto half-shells). For the TEC, up to 28 Analog-Opto Hybrids and modules have to be mounted
onto the bare petals. The assembled petals are then characterized in a longterm test during six
thermo-cycles between CMS operating temperature and room temperature. Pedestals are taken at
both temperatures and the petals are graded basically according to the number of bad strips and the
leakage current. The ﬁrst experience with 5% of petals already built is encouraging: only a few per
mille of bad strips are present per petal.
Fully equipped petals and rods are then shipped to the integration centers, where they are integrated
into the mechanical support structures. Both the TOB and TEC structures are assembled with a
precision of the order of 200 m m. The TEC structures are fully equipped with optical ribbons.
Successful trial integrations of both petals and rods have been performed. The ﬁnal integration of
petals and rods into the structures is foreseen to start end of 2005. For the TIB three out of eight CF
cylinders are mechanically ready (precision of the order of 200 m m), and the ﬁrst single-sided layer
has been fully integrated with modules. The readout test and burn in at low temperature is ongoing.
First measurements indicate less than 1% of bad strips, and a noise level better than measured in
previous test beams.

3. Test Beam Performance of Tracker Substructures

In June 2004 TOB and TEC substructures have been operated in pion (120 GeV (cid:0) c) and muon
particle beams at CERN. The TEC setup consisted of a front and a back petal (51 modules). Cor-
responding to about 1% of the TEC system, this was the largest substructure of the CMS tracker
tested so far. Stable system operation was achieved both at room temperature and at CMS operating
temperature. The signal-over-noise (S/N) distributions of all modules have been measured in peak
and deconvolution mode both in the cold environment and at room temperature, and the mean value
has been calculated per module geometry. In the cold, most probable values of the S/N of 28-33

(35-42) and 19-22 (20-24) have been observed for thin (thick) sensors in peak and deconvolution
mode, respectively. The Equivalent Noise Charge (ENC) was studied as a function of the capac-
itance (Fig. 1), which depends for CMS sensors only on the strip length [2]. The ENC is found
to be 714-1155 (1020-1681) electrons in peak (deconvolution) mode, in good agreement with the
expectation based on measurements of the noise of the APV25 chip. A mean common mode noise
of (cid:0) 173 (cid:1) 38 (cid:2) electrons in peak and (cid:0) 299 (cid:1) 76 (cid:2) electrons in deconvolution mode was measured. As
expected, a decrease of the noise of about 10% was observed between room temperature and CMS
operating conditions.

After the technical problems with sensors and hybrids have been overcome, and with the excel-
lent performance of tracker substructures proven in test beam experiments, the module production
is now running smoothly at full swing and is targeted to ﬁnish in early 2006. Tracker integration
has started, and the tracker is scheduled to be integrated into the CMS detector in autumn 2006.

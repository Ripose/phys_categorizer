Abstract

As the pre-injector of the LHC injector chain, the proton linac at
CERN is required to provide a high-intensity (180mA) beam to the
Proton Synchrotron Booster. The results of measurements at this
intensity will be presented. Furthermore, the linac is now equipped
with  bunch  shape  monitors  from  INR,  Moscow,  which  have
allowed  the  comparison  of  the  Alvarez  tank  RF  settings  with
simulations.

1  INTRODUCTION

Linac  2  has  been  in  operation  since  September  1978  and
routinely supplies protons during 6700 hours of operation per year.
The machine consists of a Duoplasmatron proton source at 90 kV,
a 750 keV RFQ, and three Alvarez tanks accelerating the beam to
50 MeV.  In  normal  operation  a  170 mA  proton  beam  is  injected
into the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) with a pulse length up
to 150 µs, at a repetition rate of 0.8 Hz [1].

From 2005 onwards, the linac will function as the pre-injector
for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), for which 180 mA is desired
[2].  This  is  difficult  to  achieve  because  the  longitudinal  beam
dynamics are strongly space-charge limited at the low energy end
of tank 1.

Within  the  framework  of  upgrading  towards  this  intensity  the
750 kV  Cockcroft-Walton  was  replaced  with  an  RFQ  in  1993.
More  recently,  three  Bunch  Shape  Monitors  (BSMs)  have  been
installed, to allow the study of the beam dynamics of the Alvarez
tanks.

2  HIGH CURRENT TESTS

The optimisation of the linac to produce higher output currents
was performed during 1999. A comparison of the readings of the
current  transformers  along  the  length  of  the  linac,  for  the  high
current case and during normal operation, is given in Figure 1. It is
clear  that  the  principle  gain  in  this  case  was  the  32%  higher
current  from 
the
improvement of 10% was possible at the end of the linac, and the
greater  losses  in  the  transfer  line  (after  the  linac)  led  to  a  final
improvement at the entrance of the PSB injection line of 6%.

this  higher  current, 

the  source.  From 

The large losses from TRA02 to TRA06 are mostly due to the

loss of the H2

+ beam at the entrance of the RFQ.

The  beam  parameters  were  verified  with  the  single-shot
emittance measurement and the spectrometer at the beginning of
the  PSB  injection  line.  No  difference  in  the  emittance  or  energy
spread  was  seen  between  the  high  current  case  and  the  normal
operation beam.

 3  BUNCH SHAPE MONITORS

The  principle  of  the  Bunch  Shape  Monitor  (constructed  by
INR, Troitsk) has been fully described in [3]. In short, a bunched
ion beam impinges on a wire target held at high voltage, releasing
secondary electrons that retain the initial bunch structure of the ion
beam.  The  electrons  are  swept  by  a  RF  deflecting  field,  which
allows  the  relative  ion  beam  intensity  at  a  given  phase  to  be
measured. By re-phasing the RF deflecting field with respect to the
linac RF, the ion density distribution can be reconstituted.

On Linac 2, three BSMs are now installed (see Figure 2). The
first  two  are  standard  devices  placed  in  the  inter-tank  sections
between  tanks  1-2  and  2-3.  At  the  output  of  the  linac,  the  3D-
BSM allows selection of a transverse portion of the beam and the
measurement of the bunch shape in a single-shot, by an array of
charge collectors. The 3D-BSM was installed in 1996 [4], and the
results of its first measurements on the proton beam are given in
[5].

with the locations of the three BSMs.

The settings of the Alvarez tanks were studied by measuring the
longitudinal movement of the bunch as a function of the RF phase
and  amplitude.  By  treating  only  the  bunch  centre,  the  effects  of
space  charge  in  the  calculation  of  the  motion  of  the  bunch  are
avoided.  The  bunch  motion  was  calculated  using  the  simulation
tool DELTAT, based on the procedures given in [6].

The  measurements  were  performed  on  the  linac  with  the
normal  operational  beam,  in  a  time  window  from  25-50 µs  after
the start of the proton pulse from the source. Measurements have
shown that before this time, the proton beam is not well stabilised
(due to current variation and the time constant of the RF feedback
loops.

are

2.1 Tank 1

Measurements at the output of tank 1 have not been completed.
The  wire  target  of  the  IT-BSM  is  held  at  high  voltage,  but  the
current being drawn is too high for the HT supply (probably due to
small  discharges  in  vacuum).  The  rectification  of  this  problem
requires  opening  the  vacuum  of  the  Alvarez  structure,  which
cannot be performed until the winter 2000-01 shutdown.

The comparison of the measured bunch position in phase and
the  simulation  is  complicated  by  the  degrees  of  freedom  (the
unknown  RF  amplitude  and  the  unknown  offset  in  the  bunch
phase).  The  measured  data  are  shown  in  Figure  3  along  with
curves from a simulation, for different RF levels of the tank. Note
that  the  measured  data  can  be  arbitrarily  offset  vertically.  The
simulation results in the same gradient as the measurement, for RF
tank  levels  of  0.95A0  ,  1.10A0  and  1.15A0  (where  A0  is  the
nominal RF level). The power requirements to run the tank at 10%
higher  than  the  nominal  values  could  not  be  fulfilled  by  the  RF
system, so the 0.95A0 line would be the most likely.

It is then estimated that the beam enters the tank with a phase of
-30o  during  normal  operation,  whereas  the  initial  synchronous
phase of the tank is -35o (where 0o is the crest of the RF wave).

With no second measurement of the beam of the bunch position

as a function of the RF level, the results are not yet conclusive.

2.2 Tank 2

With measurements of the bunch position in phase as a function
of  the  tank  2  RF  phase  and  amplitude,  the  comparison  of  the
simulated  and  measured  data  is  much  easier.  In  Figure  4a  the
measured  data  are  compared  to  the  simulations  using  DELTAT.
The  gradient  of  the  measured  data  is  very  similar  to  that  of  the
results  obtained  for  an  input  phase  of  –10o,  compared  to  the
nominal synchronous phase of –25o.

The bunch centre as a function of the tank 2 RF phase is given
in Figure 4b, and is shifted along the x-axis such that the nominal
phase corresponds to –10o. The simulation fits the measured data
well.

output of tank 1 as a function of the RF phase of tank 1. Curves
show simulated bunch position as a function of the RF phase, for
different RF amplitudes.

Figure 4. Measured data for the phase position of the bunch at the
output of tank 2 as a function of a) the RF amplitude and b) the RF
phase. Curves show simulated bunch phase position.

2.3 Tank 3

The measurements with the 3D-BSM located after tank 3 have
concentrated  on  the  longitudinal  dynamics,  and  the  transverse
distribution  of  the  beam  is  not  considered  here.  As  the  electron
bunch  is  measured  with  an  array  of  transverse  charge  collectors,
the  resolution  during 
is
approximately 4.5o, which is 2 to 4 times lower than the resolution
of the BSMs located between the tanks. Improving the resolution
results in a narrower total range of phases that can be measured.

the  measurements  reported  here 

The  measurements  of  the  phase  position  of  the  bunch  as  a
function  of  RF  amplitude  and  phase  are  given  in  Figure  5.  The
simulations are in good agreement with the measured data based
on  an  input  phase  of  –40o  compared  to  a  nominal  synchronous
phase  of  –25o,  and  with  a  RF  field  level  6%  higher  than  the
nominal value.

The BSM data compiled for tank 1 are incomplete and require
the  repair  of  the  BSM  and  the  measurement  of  the  bunch  phase
position as a function of RF amplitude before final conclusions can
be drawn.

Tank 2 data are in excellent agreement with simulations of the
bunch centre. Tank 3 data shows good agreement with simulations
but with a RF level much higher than the nominal value.

This  exercise  provides  an  excellent  starting  point  for  further
simulation with a macro-particle code (e.g. PARMILA) to provide
more  complete  understanding  of  the  dynamics  and  limitations  of
the structure with higher currents. This should allow the losses at
higher  currents  to  be  reduced  for  routine  operation  as  the  LHC
preinjector.

 4  CONCLUSIONS

It has been  demonstrated that the CERN lLinac 2 can provide
the 180 mA beam required for the LHC injector chain. The larger
resulting losses in this case mean that the beam is not at present
used in routine operation at the PS complex.

Abstract

The correction to Maxwell-Boltzmann’s velocity distribution law is obtained in the framework of
the modified special relativity theory. The detection of velocity and velocity rate distributions for thermal
molecules or atoms can serve as a test of the modified special relativity theory.

1. Introduction

There is a class of equivalent inertial frames of reference, any  one  of  which  moves  with  a  non-
zero  constant  velocity  relative  to  any  other.  Each  of  the  inertial  frames  of  reference  is  supplied  with
motionless,  rigid  unit  rods  of  equal  length  and  motionless,  synchronized  clocks  of  equal  running  rate.
Einstein defined  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  {xr,t},  r=1,2,3,  for  each  inertial  frame  of  reference
saying: “in a given inertial frame of reference  the  coordinates  mean  the  results  of  certain  measurements
with rigid (motionless) rods, a clock at rest relative to the inertial frame of reference defines a local time,
and  the  local  time  at  all  points  of  space,  indicated  by  synchronized  clocks  and  taken  together,  give  the
time  of  this  inertial  frame  of  reference.”  [1].  Besides  two  fundamental  postulates,  (i)  the  principle  of
relativity and (ii) the constancy of the light speed in all inertial frames of reference, special relativity also
uses  another  assumption  which  concerns  the  Euclidean  structure  of  gravity-free  space  and  the
homogeneity of gravity-free time in the usual inertial coordinate system,

rsdxrdxs, r,s=1,2,3,

dX2=d
dT2=dt2,

everywhere and every time [2-5].

In our recent work [6-9], we introduced the primed inertial coordinate system {x’r,t’}, r=1,2,3, in
addition  to  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  for  each  inertial  frame  of  reference.  We  assumed  the
Euclidean structures of gravity-free space and time in the primed inertial coordinate system and their non-
Euclidean structures in the usual inertial coordinate system,

rsdx’rdx’s=grs(y)dxrdxs,   r,s=1,2,3,

where  dX  and  dT  are  respectively  the  space  distance  and  time  interval  between  two  neighboring  points
(x’1,x’2,x’3,t’) and (x’1+dx’1,x’2+dx’2,x’3+dx’3,t’+dt’) in the primed  inertial  coordinate  system  or  (x1,x2,x3,t)
and  (x1+dx1,x2+dx2,x3+dx3,t+dt)  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  ys=dxs/dt,  s=1,2,3,  is  the  usual
(Newtonian)  velocity  well-defined  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  y=(ysys)1/2.  We  also  combined
this assumption with two postulates (i) and (ii) to modify special relativity. The modified special relativity
theory involves two versions of the light speed, infinite speed c’ in the primed inertial coordinate system
and finite speed c in the usual inertial coordinate system. It involves the c’-type Galilean transformation
between any two primed inertial coordinate systems and the localized Lorentz transformation between any
two usual inertial coordinate systems. The  physical  principle  in  the  modified  special  relativity  theory  is:
The c’-type Galilean invariance in the primed inertial coordinate system plus the transformation from the

primed inertial coordinate system to the usual inertial coordinate  system.  The  modified  special  relativity
theory and quantum mechanics together found a convergent and invariant quantum field theory.

In this paper, we derive, from the assumption (1a)-(1e), some equations involved in the velocity
space. These equations will lead to the correction to Maxwell-Boltzmann’s velocity distribution law.  We
propose detecting the velocity and velocity rate distributions of thermal molecules or atoms as a test of the
assumption (1a)-(1e) on local structures of gravity-free space and time, as well as, of the modified special
relativity theory.

in the primed velocity-coordinates {y’r}, r=1,2,3, or by

Hrs(y)=c2d

rs/(c2-y2)+c2yrys/(c2-y2)2,  real yr and y<c,

in the usual velocity-coordinates {yr}, r=1,2,3 [10].

where  Y=dX/dT  is  the  velocity-length,  y’s  is  the  primed  velocity  defined  by  y’s=dx’s/dt’,  s=1,2,3,  in  the
primed inertial coordinate system, y’=(y’sy’s)1/2.

Equation  (2)  embodies  what  equation  (3)  does,  i.e.  the  velocity  space  in  the  modified  special

This statement consists of two parts. The first part,  the  relationship  between  Eqs.(2)  and  (4),  is
obvious,  while  its  second  part,  the  relationship  between  Eq.(3)  and  Eqs.(5a)-(5b),  is  not  so  obvious.
Several authors studied the space with metric tensor Hrs(y) [4-5,11-14]. In the velocity space described by

The equation of geodesic line is therefore

(cid:0)y r+[2/(c2-y2)] (cid:0)y r(ys (cid:0)y s)=0,  r,s=1,2,3,

wr= (cid:0)y r/(c2-y2), r=1,2,3, 
we are able to rewrite Eq.(8) as
(cid:0)w r=0, r=1,2,3.

It is seen that

wr=constant,  r=1,2,3,

where dot refers to the derivative with respect to velocity-length. Introducing new variables

is a solution to Eqs.(10). Furthermore, due to Eqs.(9) and (10), we have

wsyr-wrys=constant, r,s=1,2,3.

Eqs.(11) and (12) specify the linear relations between any two of y1, y2 and y3. These linear relations can
be represented in terms of Eqs.(6).

In  the  velocity  space,  the  Galilean  addition  law  among  primed  velocities  is  linked  up  with  the
Einstein addition law among usual velocities. To prove this, we let IFR1 and IFR2 be two inertial frames
of reference, where IFR2 moves relative to IFR1 with usual velocity ur, r=1,2,3, as measured in IFR1. We
r, r=1,2,3, respectively,
further let an object move relative to IFR1 and IFR2 with usual velocities y1

4. The correction to Maxwell-Boltzmann’s velocity distribution law

The Euclidean structure (4) of the velocity space in the primed velocity-coordinates {y’r}, r=1,2,3,
convinces  us  that  Maxwell-Boltzmann’s  velocity  and  velocity  rate  distribution  formulas  are  valid  in  the
primed velocity-coordinates, namely

P(y’1,y’2,y’3)dy’1dy’2dy’3=N(

where  N  is  the  number  of  molecules  or  atoms,  m  their  rest  mass,  T  the  temperature,  and  KB  the
Boltzmann constant. We can employ Eqs.(15a), (15b), (16a) and (16b) to represent these two formulas in
the usual velocity-coordinates {yr}, r=1,2,3.

Using Eq.(15b) and
dy’1dy’2dy’3= g 4dy1dy2dy3

which is deduced from Eqs.(16a) and (16b), where g  is in Eq.(17), we have from Eq.(23)

It  is  a  condition  for  getting  Eqs.(26)  and  (28)  that  temperature  T  is  invariant  under  the  transformation
from  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  to  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  The  reasons  for  this
will be given in another place [16].

Eqs.(26)  and  (28)  are  the  correction  to  Maxwell-Boltzmann’s  velocity  and  velocity  rate
distributions in the usual velocity-coordinates {yr}, r=1,2,3. It is a characteristic that both P(y1,y2,y3) and
P(y) go to zero when y approaches c. It is also a characteristic that  two  distribution  functions  P(y1,y2,y3)
and P(y) respectively reduce to their previous forms,

We propose to detect the velocity and velocity rate distributions of thermal molecules or atoms for

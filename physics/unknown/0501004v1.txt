Summary 
As shown in our previous experiments fine structure of histograms of 
α-activity measurements serve as a sensitive tool for investigation of cosmo-
physical influences. Particularly, the histograms structure is changed with the 
period  equal  to  sidereal  (1436  min)  and  solar  (1440)  day.  It  is  similar  with 
the  high  probability  in  different  geographic  points  at  the  same  local 
(longitude)  time.  More  recently  investigations  were  carried  out  with 
collimators,  cutting  out  separate  flows  of  total  α-particles  flying  out  at 
radioactive decay of 239Pu. These experiments revealed sharp dependence the 
histogram structure on the direction of α-particles flow. 

In  the  presented  work  measurements  were  made  with  collimators 
rotating  in  the  plane  of  sky  equator.  It  was  shown  that  during  rotation  the 
shape  of  histograms  changes  with  periods  determined  by  number  of 
revolution.  These  results  correspond  to  the  assumption  that  the  histogram 
shapes  are  determined  by  a  picture  of  the  celestial  sphere,  and  also  by 
interposition of the Earth, the Sun and the Moon. 

 
 
Introduction 
It  has  been  earlier  shown,  that  the  fine  structure  of  statistical 
distributions of measurement results of processes of various nature depends 
on cosmo-physical factors. The shape  of  corresponding  histograms  changes 
with the period equal to sidereal and solar day, i.e. 1436 and 1440 minutes 
[1-4]. 
These  periods  disappeared  at  measurements  of  alpha-activity  of  239Pu 
samples  near  the  North  Pole  [5].  These  results  corresponded  to  the 
assumption  of  association  of  the  histogram  shapes  with  a  picture  of  the 
celestial  sphere,  and  also  with  interposition  of  the  Earth,  the  Sun  and  the 
Moon.

However,  at  measurements  at  latitude  54oN  (in  Pushchino),  absence 
of the daily period [6] also was revealed when using collimators restricting a 
flow of the alpha particles of radioactive decay at the direction to the north 
celestial pole. This result meant, that the question is not about dependence on 
a picture of the celestial sphere above a place of measurements, but about a 
direction of alpha particles flow. 

In  experiments  with  two  collimators,  directed  one  to  the  East  and 
another to the West, it was revealed, that histograms of the similar shape at 
measurements  with  west  collimator  appear  at  718  minutes  (half  of  sidereal 
day)  later  then  ones  registered  with  East  collimator  [6].  Therefore,  as 
acquired,  the  space  surrounding  the  Earth  is  highly  anisotropic,  and  this 
anisotropy is connected basically to a picture of the celestial sphere (sphere 
of distant stars). 

This suggestion has been confirmed in experiments with collimators, 
rotated counter-clockwise,  west to east (i.e. in a direction of rotation of the 
Earth),  as  well  as  clockwise  (east  to  west).  The  description  of  these 
experiments is given further. 

Methods 
As well as earlier, the basic object of these of research  was a  set of 
histograms  constructed  by  results  of  measurements  of  alpha-activity  of 
samples 239Pu. 

for 

the  devices 

Experimental  methods, 

alpha-radioactivity 
measurements  of  239Pu  samples  with  collimators,  and  also  construction  of 
histograms  and  analysis  of  its  shapes,  are  described  in  details  in  the  earlier 
publications [2,3,8]. Measurements of number of events of radioactive decay 
were  completed  by  device  designed  by  one  of  the  authors  (I.A.R.).  In  this 
device the semi-conductor detector (photo diode) is placed after collimator, 
restricting  a  flow  of  the  alpha  particles  in  a  certain  direction.  Results  of 
measurements, consecutive numbers of events of the decay registered by the 
detector in 1-second intervals, are stored in computer archive. 

Depending  on  specific  targets,  a  time  sequence  of  1-second 
measurements was summarized to consecutive values of activity for 6, 15 or 
60  seconds.  Obtained  time  series  were  separated  into  consecutive  pieces  of 
60  numbers  in  each.  A  histogram  was  built  for  each  piece  of  60  numbers. 
Histograms  were  smoothed  using  the  method  of  moving  averages  for  the 
greater convenience of a visual estimation of similarity of their shapes (more 
details  see  in  [8,9]).  Comparison  of  histograms  was  performed  using 
auxiliary computer program by Edwin Pozharski [8]. 

A mechanical device designed by one of the authors (V.A.Sh) was 

used in experiments with rotation of collimators. In this device the measuring 
piece of equipment with collimator was attached to the platform rotated in a 
plane of Celestial Equator.

Results 

A. Three revolutions of collimator counter-clockwise in a day. 
The  diurnal  period  of  increase  in  frequency  of  histograms  with 
similar shape means dependence of an observable picture on rotation of the 
Earth. 

The period of approximately 24 hours or with higher resolution 1436 
minutes is also observed at measurements using collimators restricting a flow 
of alpha particles in a certain direction [6,7]. Therefore, the fine structure of 
distribution  of  results  of  measurements  depends  on  what  site  of  celestial 
sphere  the  flow  of  alpha  particles  is  directed  to.  Studies  of  shapes  of 
histograms constructed by results of measurements using rotated collimators 
testify to the benefit of this assumption. 

The  number  of  the  “diurnal”  cycles  at  clockwise  rotation  should  be 
one less then numbers of collimator revolutions because of compensation of 
the Earth rotation.  

At May 28 through June 10, 2004, we have performed measurements 
of  alpha-activity  of  a  sample  239Pu  at  3  collimator  revolutions  a  day,  and 
also, for the control, simultaneous measurements with motionless collimator, 
directed to the West. Results of these measurements are presented on fig. 1-
4. At these figures a dependence of frequency histograms of the same shape 
on size of time interval between similar histograms is shown. 

Fig.1  shows  results  of  comparison  of  60-minute  histograms, 
typical 
constructed  at  measurements  with  motionless  collimator.  A 
dependence  repeatedly  obtained  in  earlier  studies  is  visible  at  the  fig.1: 
histograms  of  the  same  shape  most  likely  appear  at  the  nearest  intervals  of 
time (“effect of a near zone”) and in one day (24 hours). 

Fig.  2  presents  the  result  of  comparison  of  60-minute  histograms 
constructed at measurements with collimator rotated 3 times a day counter-
clockwise in a plane of celestial equator.

As you can see at the fig. 2, at three revolutions of collimator counter-
clockwise, the frequency of similar histograms fluctuates with the period of 6 
hours: peaks correspond to the intervals of 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours. 

24-hour period at a higher resolution consists of two components. It is 
visible  by  comparison  of  one-minute  histograms  shown  at  fig.  3  for 
measurements with motionless collimator and at fig. 4 for measurements at 3 
collimator revolutions counter-clockwise. At measurements with motionless 
collimator  (fig.  3)  there  are  two  peaks  -  one  corresponds  to  sidereal  day 
(1436 minutes), the second, which is less expressed, corresponds to solar day 
(1440 minutes). 

You  can  see  at  fig.4  that  6-hour  period  at  measurements  with  three 
revolutions  of  collimator  also  has  two  components.  The  first  6-hour 
maximum has two joint peaks of 359 and 360 minutes. The second 12-hour 
maximum  has  two  peaks  of  718  and  720  minutes.  The  third  maximum  (18 
hours)  has  two  peaks  of  1077  and  1080  minutes.  And  the  fourth  one  (24 
hours) has two peaks of 1436 and 1440 minutes.

Fig.  4.  Experiments  with  rotated  collimators.  Frequency  of 
similar  1-minute  histograms  by  time  interval  between  them.  Three 
revolutions  a  day  counter-clockwise.  Two  components  of  the  6-hour 
period: sidereal and solar. 

 

Results of these experiments confirm a conclusion according to which 
a  change  in  histogram  shape  is  caused  by  change  in  direction  of  alpha 
particles  flow  in  relation  to  distant  stars  and  the  Sun  (and  other  space 
objects).  This  conclusion  is  supported  also  by  results  of  experiments  with 
rotation of collimator clockwise. 

In these experiments collimator made one revolution a day clockwise, 
east to west, i.e. against daily rotation of the Earth. As a result, the flow of 
alpha particles all the time was directed to the same point of celestial sphere. 
We  expected  in  this  case  disappearance  the  diurnal  period  of  frequency  of 
similar histograms. This expectation was proved to be true. 

On  fig.  5  and  6  one  can  see  that  in  such  experiments  frequency  of 
appearance of similar 60 minute and 1-minute histograms doesn’t depend on 
time.  At  the  same  time  at  synchronous  measurements  with  motionless 
collimator the usual dependence with the diurnal period and near zone efect 
is observed.

Discussion 
Results  of  measurements  with  rotated  collimator  confirm  a  conclusion  about 
dependence of fine structure of statistical distributions on a direction in space. This fine 
structure  is  defined  by  a  spectrum  of  amplitudes  of  fluctuations  of  measured  values. 
Presence of "peaks" and "hollows" at corresponding histograms suggests presence of the 
primary, allocated, "forbidden" and "permissible" values of amplitudes of fluctuations in 
each  given  moment  [4].  Thus,  a  fine  structure  of  statistical  distributions  presents  a 
spectrum  of  the  permissible  amplitudes  of  fluctuations,  and  dependence  of  it  on  a 
direction in space shows sharp anisotropy of space. 

It is necessary to emphasize, that the question is not about influence on the subject 
of  measurement  (in  this  case  on  radioactive  decay).  With  accuracy  of  traditional 
radioactive  decay 
statistical  criteria,  overall  characteristics  of  distribution  of 
measurements  compliant  with  Poisson  distribution  [3].  Only  the  shape  of  histogram 
constructed  for  small  sample  size  varies  regularly.  This  regularity  emerges  in  precise 
sidereal and solar periods of increase of frequency of similar histograms. 

As shown above, the shape of histograms constructed by results of measurements 
of  alpha-activity  of  samples  239Pu,  varies  with  the  period  determined  by  number  of 
revolutions  in  relation  to  celestial  sphere  and  the  Sun.  In  experiments  with  collimator, 
which  made  three  revolutions  counter-clockwise,  the  “diurnal”  period  was  equal  to  6 
hours (three revolutions of collimator and one revolution of the Earth was observed - in 
total 4 revolutions in relation to celestial sphere and the Sun give the period equal 24/4 = 
6 hours). 

 
The result obtained in experiments with one revolution of collimator clockwise is 
not  less  important.  The  Earth  rotation  is  compensated  and  a  flow  of  alpha  particles  is 
directed all the time to the same point of celestial sphere. In these experiments the diurnal 
period was not observed at all. 

The obtained results, though very clear ones, cause natural bewilderment. 
Really,  it  is  completely  not  obvious,  by  virtue  of  what  reasons  the  spectrum  of 
amplitudes  of  fluctuations  of  number  of  alpha  particles,  may  depend  on  a  direction  of 
their flow in relation to celestial sphere and the Sun. The explanation of these phenomena 
probably demands essential change in general physical conceptions. 

In such situation a dominant problem is to validate a reliability of the discussed 

phenomena. In aggregate of performed studies, we believe this task was completed .

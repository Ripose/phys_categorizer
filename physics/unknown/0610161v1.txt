ABSTRACT

Permeability measured on three samples in a triaxial cell under effec-
tive confining pressure from 0.2 to 2.5 MPa ranges from 10–18 to 10–19
m2.  Overall,  results  indicate  that  permeability  decreases  with  effective
confining pressure up to 1.5 MPa; however, measurements at low effec-
tive pressure are too dispersed to yield a precise general relationship be-
tween  permeability  and  pressure.  When  the  effective  pressure  is
increased from 1.5 to 2.5 MPa, permeability is roughly constant (~1–4 (cid:1)
10–19 m2). Samples deformed in the triaxial cell developed slickenlined
fractures,  and  permeability  measurements  were  performed  before  and
after failure. A permeability increase is observed when the sample fails
under low effective confining pressure (0.2 MPa), but not under effec-
tive  pressure  corresponding  to  the  overburden  stress.  Under  isotropic
stress  conditions,  permeability  decrease  related  to  fracture  closure  oc-
curs at a relatively high effective pressure of ~1.5 MPa. Coefficients of
friction on the fractures formed in the triaxial cell are ~0.4.

eters under in situ conditions is therefore important in understanding
deformation  processes  in  accretionary  complexes.  Most  permeability
measurements on samples from the Nankai accretionary complex have
been  performed  without  pressure  confinement  (Taylor  and  Fischer,
1993)  or  at  low  confining  pressure  (<1  MPa)  (Gamage  and  Screaton,
this  volume;  Karig,  1993).  Measurements  of  permeability  under  1–5
MPa  effective  confining  stress  give  lower  values  (Byrne  et  al.,  1993).
Here, we report measurements performed in the 0.5- to 2.5-MPa range
in  a  triaxial  cell  with  the  main  purpose  of  approaching  in  situ  stress
conditions.  These  measurements  are  indicative  of  the  permeability  of
the unfractured sediment and may, therefore, constrain fluid flow out
of the fault zones through the wallrock. The permeability of fractured
zones may be higher, especially if the fractures are dilated because of a
high fluid pressure. To investigate the effect of fracturing, samples were
failed  along  drained  paths  at  low  (0.2  MPa)  and  relatively  high  (2.5
MPa) effective pressure and permeability was measured before and after
fracturation. Slickenlined fractures formed during the failure tests with
visual aspects similar to fractures observed on core samples, and it was
possible to determine the friction coefficient of these surfaces. Experi-
mental difficulties and time constraints limited the number of samples
that could be processed; therefore, interpretations are preliminary.

METHODS AND SAMPLES

Permeabilities  in  this  study  were  measured  using  a  pulse  decay
method (Brace et al., 1968; Jouniaux et al., 1994, 1995). The pulse is a
small  step change (0.1–0.3  MPa)  of  differential fluid pressure imposed
between pressure vessels connected at the ends of the sample. When a
pressure pulse ∆P0 is applied, the differential pressure ∆P(t) decays expo-
nentially as a function of time, t:

∆P(t) = 2∆P0V2/(V1+V2) e–mt,

V1, V2 = the upstream and downstream reservoir volumes 
(V1 = V2 = 50 × 10–6 m3 in our experimental setup),

= time, and

t
m = a decay time constant (Fig. F1).

Plotting the decay curve in terms of ln[∆P(t)] vs. time t yields a straight
line having a slope m, and the permeability k can be determined by

k = mµ(L/A) × [Cup × Cd/(Cup+Cd)], 

where

L = length of the sample,
A = cross-sectional area of the sample,
m = dynamic  viscosity  of  pore  fluid  at  temperature  measurement

(10–3 Pa·s at 20°C), and

[Cup × Cd/(Cup+Cd)] = storage of the pressure vessels (2.4 × 10–14 m3/Pa).

Two  GDS  pressure  controllers  (50  cm3  internal  volume)  in  standby
mode were used as constant-volume pressure vessels during pulse decay
measurements. Forty-one measurements were performed with the pulse
decay method at various levels of effective confining pressure (confining
pressure – pore pressure) from 0.34 to 2.4 MPa.

We discarded measurements when an exponential could not be fitted
to the data. The largest deviations from the ideal exponential curve cor-
relate with room temperature variations and are attributed to the ther-
mal  expansion  of  water  within  the  pressure  controllers  (or  of  the
pressure  controllers  themselves).  The  pulse  decay  method  requires  a
small pulse initial pressure difference (10%) compared to the effective
pressure. Because the pressure pulse is at least 0.1 MPa (limited by the
precision of the pressure gauges), measurements performed at effective
confining  pressure  <1  MPa  do  not  follow  this  condition.  These  mea-
surements were retained when the exponential fit was good but yielded
scattered results (Fig. F2).

For  comparison,  two  permeability  measurements  were  performed
from steady-state flow under a constant pressure gradient ∆P (0.1–0.28
MPa)  with  GDS  pressure  controllers  in  locked  pressure  mode.  Time
needed  for  these  measurements  is  about  twice  the  time  needed  using
the pulse decay method. Permeability was calculated using Darcy’s law:

k = QµL/(A×∆P).

Measurements were performed on three samples (diameter = 25 mm)
from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 190 (Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al.,
2001; Moore et al., 2001) cored either in the vertical direction (v) or in
the horizontal direction (h) (Table T1). The overburden stress was calcu-
lated by integrating the bulk density with depth. The effective overbur-
den stress range is estimated assuming an overpressure ratio between 0
and 0.42 (maximum overpressure ratio determined for the underthrust
sediments by Screaton et al. [2002]).

RESULTS

Permeability

Permeability  measurements  were  performed  on  sample  190-1174B-
42R-1, 93–95 cm (vertical), under increasing isotropic pressure from ef-
fective pressures of 0.5–1.5 MPa over a period of 10 days (Fig. F2A). This
sample was maintained at 0.5 MPa effective pressure for 8 days and ab-
sorbed 1262 mm3 water without significant total volume change, show-
ing  that  the  sample  was  not  fully  saturated  at  the  beginning  of  the
experiment. We calculated an initial water saturation of 86%. Measure-
ments made on Sample 190-1174B-42R-1, 93–95 cm (vertical), allowed
a comparison of steady-state flow and pressure decay methods. The two
measurements performed using the flow method (1.2 × 10–18 m2 at an
effective pressure of 0.6 MPa and 4.1 × 10–19 m2 at an effective pressure
of 1.41 MPa) are at the upper limit of the range of measurements done
using  the  pulse  decay  method (3.6–4.5 ×  10–19 m2 at  0.5  MPa  effective
pressure  and  1.6–3.7  ×  10–19  m2  at  1.5  MPa  effective  pressure)  but  are
compatible. The 1.2 ± 0.2 × 10–18 m2 permeability value at 0.6 MPa effec-
tive  pressure  we  obtained  using  the  flow  method  is  close  to  the  2.3  ×
10–18 m2 permeability measured using the same method on Sample 190-

1174B-42R-3,  133–150  cm  (538  meters  below  seafloor  [mbsf]),  at  the
same effective pressure (Gamage and Screaton, this volume).

Sample 190-1173A-55X-5, 135–150 cm (vertical), was fractured dur-
ing a failure test (experiment 1) performed at a low confining effective
stress (0.2 MPa). This fracturation induced a single order of magnitude
permeability increase from 1–2 × 10–19 m2 to ~1.4 × 10–18 m2 (Fig. F2B,
exp. 1). The sample was removed from the triaxial press to observe the
fracture (Fig. F3). This same sample (called “previously fractured” in Ta-
ble T2) was used 2 days later for new permeability measurements under
increasing  isotropic  conditions  from  0.2  to  2.4  MPa  effective  pressure
for  6  days  (experiment  2).  The  evolution  of  confining  and  pore  pres-
sures and the permeability measurements are shown in Figure F4. Per-
meability  decreased  by  nearly  one  order  of  magnitude  from  ~10–18  to
~10–19 m2 from effective pressures of 0.5 to 1.5 MPa (Fig. F2B, exp. 2).
Then the permeability remained nearly constant (~1.8 × 10–19 m2) with
increasing effective pressure.

Sample  190-1173A-55X-5,  135–150  cm  (horizontal),  was  loaded
along  an  isotropic  path  to  a  high  confining  effective  stress  (2.5  MPa).
Permeability  was  measured  first  under  isotropic  conditions  and  then
under  deviatoric  stress  before  and  after  failure.  Failure  occurred  at  5.0
MPa of effective axial stress and 1.5% of deformation. The deformation
rate was 4.2 × 10–9 s–1 during the hydrostatic stage (14 days) and 1.9–3.2
× 10–8 s–1 during the deviatoric stage (16 days). Permeability decreased
by a factor of two (from ~8 to ~4 × 10–19 m2) during isotropic loading as
effective  pressure  increased  from  1  to  2  MPa  and  then  stayed  roughly
constant.  Permeability  decreased  during  failure  and  then  recovered  as
the sample was deformed beyond the failure point. Photographs show-
ing the fractures were taken after the experiments (Fig. F5).

All our permeability measurements performed in the triaxial cell are
lower  than  measurements  performed  at  a  low  effective  stress  (Taylor
and  Fisher,  1993;  Gamage  and  Screaton,  this  volume),  which  range
from 10–16 to 10–18 m2 for samples from ~600 mbsf. However, they are in
the  same  range  as  values  measured  at  <1–5  MPa  effective  confining
stress (Byrne et al., 1993), ranging 1.3 × 10–20 to 1.3 × 10–18 m2. Byrne et
al. (1993) also observed transient permeability variations with strain.

Overall results indicate permeability decreases with effective confin-
ing pressure as high as 1.5 MPa (Fig. F2A). This permeability reduction
occurs with cumulative void decreases of 0.015–0.054 depending on the
sample (Table T2). However, measurements at low effective pressure are
too  dispersed  to  yield  a  precise  general  relationship  between  pressure
and permeability. When the effective pressure is increased as high as 2.5
Mpa, permeability is roughly constant (1–4 × 10–19 m2) but the void ra-
tio  continues  to  decrease,  reaching  a  final  cumulative  void  ratio  de-
crease  of  0.08–0.10. Our  results  also  suggest  that  fracturing  does  not
affect  permeability  when  the  effective  stress  is  more  than  ~1.5  MPa.
They  also  show  the  enhancement  of  permeability  by  fracturing  when
effective stress is low, followed by the permeability decrease with the in-
crease in effective stress, interpreted as fracture closure.

Bulk Compressibility Measurements

The  bulk  compressibilities  of  the  samples  were  estimated  using  the
volume of pore fluid expelled from the sample (∆V) in response to an
increase of the effective confining pressure in isotropic stress conditions
and before the yield point. The compressibility is calculated as

α = 1/V × (∆V/∆P),

where V = the volume of the sample. Results show a value of 1.1 ± 0.2 ×
10–8 Pa–1 for Sample 190-1174B-42R-1, 93–95 cm; 1.5 ± 0.2 × 10–8 MPa–1
for Sample 190-1173A-55X-5, 135–150 cm, in the vertical direction; and
1.4 ± 0.5 × 10–8 MPa–1 for the same sample in the horizontal direction.
These  compressibility  values  correspond  to  the  elastic  deformation  of
the sample. Compressibilities determined on the unloading curve were
in the same range, confirming that the compressibilities were measured
in the elastic domain of the samples.

These  estimations  can  be  compared  with  values  deduced  from  the
stiffness  modulus  derived  from  consolidation  tests  realized  after  Leg
131 (Moran et al., 1993). The compressibility is the inverse of the stiff-
ness  modulus.  Before  the  yield  point,  Sample  131-808C-23R-3  (514
mbsf)  showed  a  stiffness  modulus  of  50–250  MPa,  corresponding  to  a
compressibility  of  4.0 ×  10–9  to  2.0 ×  10–8  Pa–1.  These  different  estima-
tions remain in the same range.

Friction Coefficients

Friction  coefficients  were  calculated  for  vertically  and  horizontally
oriented Samples 190-1173A-55X-5, 135–150 cm (horizontal), and the
same sample in the vertical direction. These samples were subjected to
drained axial compression in the triaxial cell and developed slickenlined
faultlike  fractures  during  failure  (Figs.  F3, F5).  The  shear  and  normal
stresses resolved on a rupture plane inclined at an angle of α from the
vertical are as follows (Jaeger, 1959):

τ = [(σ

1 – σ

3)/2]× sin(2α), and

σ

n = {[(σ

1 + σ

3)/2] – [(σ

1 – σ

3)/2]} × cos(2α),

where

σ
σ

1 = effective axial stress (axial stress – pore pressure) and
3 = effective confining pressure.

As axial strain increases, axial stress reaches a peak stress corresponding
to the failure of the sample. Then the stress reaches a plateau lower than
the  peak  stress,  corresponding  to  an  axial  strain  increase  at  constant
stresses. This plateau is interpreted as steady-state sliding on the previ-
ously formed fracture. The friction coefficient, µ, is calculated at this pla-
teau (Byerlee, 1978): 

µ = τ/σ

n.

Three  friction  coefficients  were  calculated  on  two  samples  (Table  T3).
Sample 190-1173A-55X-5 (horizontal) presented a friction coefficient of
0.40.  The  previously  fractured  Sample  190-1173A-55X-5  (vertical)  pre-
sented  a  strain-stress  curve  with  a  plateau  at  4.9  MPa  axial  effective
stress, interrupted by a 45% drop in axial stress, followed by a new axial
stress buildup to a second plateau at 5.2 MPa. The sudden drop in axial
stress could be the result of oversliding (unstable sliding) on the fracture.
The  friction  coefficients  calculated  at  these  two  plateaus  are  0.37  and
0.40. These friction coefficients are consistent with measurements per-

formed (usually at much higher effective pressure on the order of 100
MPa)  on pure  Ca smectite gouge during velocity-stepping direct shear
experiments (Saffer et al., 2001) or on a gouge of a saturated mixture of
~60% quartz and ~40% montmorillonite (Logan and Ranenzahn, 1987)
during steady-state sliding and on saturated illite (Morrow et al., 1992).
Kopf and Brown (2003) measured friction coefficients of ~0.14 for puri-
fied smectite and ~0.25 for illite under a range of effective pressures of
1–30 MPa. They estimated, based on ring shear experiments and miner-
alogical composition, the friction coefficient on Nankai décollement to
be  0.30–0.32.  These  values,  lower  than  our  measurements,  were  per-
formed  using  elevated  displacement.  The  values  of  Kopf  and  Brown
(2003) may be representative of well-developed faults like the décolle-
ment, whereas our measured friction coefficients may be representative
of  fractures  with  shorter  sliding,  and  therefore  closer  to  initial  failure
conditions.

CONCLUSION

Permeability measurements show values of ~2–6 × 10–19 m2 when the
effective  pressure  is  ~2.5  MPa  and  the  drained  compressibility  of  the
sample is ~1.3 × 10–8 Pa–1. If these values are representative of permea-
bility and compressibility of fault wallrock under in situ conditions, dif-
fusion  of  pore  pressure  in  the  wallrock  would  affect  a  characteristic
length of 20–50 m in ~100–1000 yr. Considering that the fault zone it-
self  is  20–30  m  wide  and  that  the  diffusion  distance  varies  with  the
square  root  of  time,  equilibration  of  pore  pressure  between  the  fault
zone should be achieved in <100,000 yr. This implies that a higher pore
pressure  in  the  fault  zone  than  in  the  surrounding  sediments  can  be
maintained  only  during  transient  events. These  transient  events  may
relate  to  slip  events  and  to  décollement  propagation  episodes  (Bour-
lange et al., 2003). 

Failure tests show that permeability increases as a result of the forma-
tion of a faultlike slip plane in the sample when confining stress is low.
Sample 190-1173A-55X-5 (vertical) was fractured at 0.2-MPa confining
effective stress, and this induced an increase of permeability by one or-
der  of  magnitude.  This  fractured  sample  was  then  used  in  the  triaxial
cell  for  permeability  measurements  under  increasing  confining  pres-
sure. During this second phase, permeability decreased sharply between
1.23 and 1.57 MPa, whereas the sample experienced only a small (0.01)
void  ratio  change  (see  Table  T2;  Fig.  F2).  This  sharp  permeability  de-
crease likely corresponds to fracture closure. This suggests that once hy-
draulically  conductive  fractures  have  been  formed,  they  may  remain
hydraulically  conductive  up  to  a  relatively  high  confining  stress  (1.2
MPa).  This  permeability  cycle  presents  similarity  with  transient  in-
creases in expelled water flow observed during sample loading (Byrne et
al., 1993). These observations were interpreted as a transient increase in
permeability associated with dilation and shear zone formation in the
sample.

Friction coefficients determined in this study (0.37–0.40)  are in the
range  expected  for  the  clay-rich  lithology  and  are  not  exceptionally
low. This suggests a high fluid pressure is required inside the fault zone
for decoupling at the décollement level. If a Coulomb wedge model is
used  (Dahlen,  1984),  sliding  along  the  décollement  is  allowed  only
when the excess pore pressure ratio, λ
b

∗, at the décollement is >0.6:

This  value  is  significantly  higher  than  the  0.47  value  estimated  from
compaction curves (Screaton et al., 2002) at ODP Site 808. This suggests
a higher pore pressure in the fault zone during episodes of sliding.

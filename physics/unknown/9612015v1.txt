Diﬀerentials of higher order
in
non commutative diﬀerential geometry

Abstract

In diﬀerential geometry, the notation dnf along with the corresponding
formalism has fallen into disuse since the birth of exterior calculus. However,
diﬀerentials of higher order are useful objects that can be interpreted in terms
of functions on iterated tangent bundles (or in term of jets). We generalize this
notion to the case of non commutative diﬀerential geometry. For an arbitrary
algebra A, people already know how to deﬁne the diﬀerential algebra ΩA of
universal diﬀerential forms over A. We deﬁne Leibniz forms of order n (these
nA) as particular
are not forms of degree n, i.e. they are not elements of Ω
elements of what we call the “iterated frame algebra” of order n, FnA, which
is itself deﬁned as the 2n tensor power of the algebra A. We give a system
of generators for this iterated frame algebra and identify the A left-module
of forms of order n as a particular vector subspace included in the space
of universal one-forms built over the iterated frame algebra of order n − 1.
We study the algebraic structure of these objects, recover the case of the
commutative diﬀerential calculus of order n (Leibniz diﬀerentials) and give a
few examples.

Keywords: non-commutative geometry, diﬀerential calculus, Leibniz, iterated bun-
dles, jets.

Introduction

Given a function f on a manifold, one knows how to consider the collection of its ﬁrst
derivatives, with respect to a coordinate frame {∂µ
∂xµ } as a “global object” :
we just have to build the one-form df = ∂µf dxµ. When our manifold is riemannian,
we may also use the metric g = {gµν}, to “rise” the indices and build the gradient
grad f , which is a vector ﬁeld of components gµν∂µf . As everybody knows, the
collection of ﬁrst derivatives of f transforms nicely (Leibniz rule!) under a change
of coordinates. Things become more subtle at the level of second derivatives : here
one usually needs a linear connection to build an invariant object.

.
= ∂

Diﬀerential forms of degree 2, 3 . . . are very familiar objects that can be con-
sidered as fully antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds, but they do not provide the geometric
objects that one needs to handle second or higher derivatives of a function (since
∂µ∂νf = ∂ν ∂µf , the only two-form that we can build from second derivatives alone
is equal to 0).

As it is well known, a possibility is to introduce a linear connection ∇, so that, if
ω is a one-form, we may consider the covariant derivatives (call ωµ;ν the components
.
of ∇ω). In particular, if ω = df , we may consider the Hessian of f , namely Hess f
=
∇∇f = ∇df , which is a bilinear form on the tangent bundle (symmetric when
there is no torsion). The components of Hess f , of course, transform nicely under
a change of coordinates, but they involve the linear connection.

There is another possibility which does not require introduction of linear con-
nections and is based on the observation that instead of the chain rule for ﬁrst
derivatives, dφ/dv = (dφ/du) (du/dv), we have something more complicated for sec-
ond derivatives, namely, d2φ/dv2 = (d2φ/du2) (du/dv)2 + (dφ/du) d2u/dv2. Since
transforming between coordinate systems requires that the second derivative be ac-
companied by the ﬁrst, one may therefore try to put them together to form a new
object. This idea lead mathematicians of the nineteenth century to introduce a
formalism using “diﬀerentials of higher orders” (not to be confused with nowadays
usual diﬀerential forms of degree p) and notations such as dpf . This notation,
along with the corresponding formalism has almost disappeared since the birth of
exterior calculus (every student knows that d2 = 0!) These diﬀerentials of higher
orders can be actually be given a good invariant geometric status by working in the
so called “bundle of jets of inﬁnite order” or in iterated frame bundles. The basic
idea, that we illustrate in the case of forms of order 2, is the following: let f be a
function on a manifold M , its diﬀerential df can be paired with a vector at a given
point to give a number; df is therefore a function on the tangent bundle T M ; but
T M is itself a manifold and one can look at the diﬀerential d1g (d1 is not the same d
as before!) of a function g on this manifold. In particular, one can build the object
δ2f

.
= d1(df ) which is a function on T 2M = T (T M ). One can continue. . .
There are, unfortunately, almost no papers trying to ﬁll the gap between the
Leibniz formalism of diﬀerential forms of higher order and modern diﬀerential ge-
ometry (with the notable exception of [7]). We shall call these forms Leibniz forms
of order n to distinguish them from the usual (exterior) diﬀerential forms of degree
n.

One motivation to resuscitate this almost forgotten formalism, in the context of
usual (“commutative”) geometry comes from the theory of stochastic processes [5]
where it was shown that the natural objects that one should integrate along some
irregular and continuous curves (like brownian curves) are not the usual one-forms
of diﬀerential geometry but. . . diﬀerentials of order 2. Similar considerations could
be made when considering fractal objects with integral Haussdorf dimension.

1

Our motivation, in the present paper, comes actually from quantum ﬁeld theory

and is two-fold.

Most constructions of quantum physics are usually expressed in terms of oper-
ator algebras (or Feynmann graphs). We believe that it is useful to “geometrize”
quantum ﬁeld theory, i.e. to interpret its objects in terms of geometrical quantities
like forms, connections etc ., but of course, this has to be done “in a quantum
way”, where non commutative algebras replace the ordinary commutative algebras
of smooth functions over manifolds. To some extent, this attempt has been initi-
ated and developed by several people during the last few years (cf.
in particular
the works by A. Connes or M. Dubois-Violette). We believe that introducing a non
commutative analogue for Leibniz forms of higher orders will turn out to be a useful
step in this program.

Another (unrelated) physical motivation for our present work is the hope that
such a formalism could help people to devise consistent theories involving ﬁelds with
spin higher than 2.

In a nutshell, the purpose of the present paper is to introduce, for any associative
algebra A a formalism of diﬀerential forms of higher orders that, in the case where
A is the algebra of smooth functions on a diﬀerentiable manifold, specializes to
the “old” Leibniz forms of order n (we are not trying discuss a non commutative
analogue for De Rham forms of degree n since this is already well known. . .)

To our knowledge, there are no other papers on the present subject in the

literature (neither in mathematics nor in theoretical physics).

The forms of order k (along with diﬀerentials satisfying relations like dnk = 0)
introduced recently by [4], are not related to ours but to algebras deformations or
to quantum groups.

2 Algebras, universal diﬀerential algebras and it-

erated frame algebras

Let A be a unital associative algebra over the ﬁeld of complex numbers. and call 1
the unit of A.

.
= A⊗(p+1). Warning: there is a shift of the degree by 1 so that

• We call T pA
T 0A = A.
The vector spaces T pA are bi-modules over A, with

a × a0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . an = aa0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . an
a0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . an ⊗ a = a0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ana

T A

.
=

L

p T pA is a graded algebra with multiplication

a0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ap · b0 ⊗ b1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ bq = a0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ apb0 ⊗ b1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ bq

We shall call T A the “T -algebra of A”. Notice that this is not the tensorial
algebra over A: the product of a0 ⊗ a1 and b0 ⊗ b1 in the tensorial algebra
would be a0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ b0 ⊗ b1 whereas it is a0 ⊗ a1b0 ⊗ b1 in T A.

• We denote by Ap the vector space A⊗p endowed with the product algebra
structure inherited from A. For instance, A2 = A ⊗ A has a multiplication
deﬁned by: (a1 ⊗ b1)(a2 ⊗ b2) = a1a2 ⊗ b1b2. Notice that, although Ap+1 and
T pA coincide, as vector spaces, their algebraic structures are totally diﬀerent.
The unit of the algebra Ap is 1p

.
= 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1, (p times).

.
=

• Let m be the multiplication map of A, i.e. , m(a ⊗ b ∈ A ⊗ A) = ab ∈ A.
Let ΩA the universal diﬀerential algebra of A. We recall its construction.
p ΩpA where Ω0A = A, Ω1A = Ker(m) ⊂ T 1A, ΩpA = Ω1A ⊗A
ΩA
.
Ω1A ⊗A . . . Ω1A ⊂ T pA. As usual, one deﬁnes d0b
= 1 ⊗ b − b ⊗ 1 so that
ΩpA is the linear span of the monomials a0d0a1d0a2 . . . d0ap with the product
inherited from T A. Remember that ΩA ⊂ T A. When A is an algebra of
functions over a space M (hence a commutative algebra), it is clear that we
can identity d0b with the function of two variables [d0b](x, y) = b(y) − b(x).

L

• Let mp be the multiplication map in the algebra Ap, i.e. , mp((a1 ⊗ a2 . . . ⊗
ap) ⊗ (b1 ⊗ b2 . . . ⊗ bp) ∈ Ap ⊗ Ap = A2p) = a1b1 ⊗ a2b2 . . . ⊗ apbp ∈ Ap We call
ΩAp the universal diﬀerential algebra of Ap (and sometimes, the “Ω-algebra”
of Ap). It is deﬁned exactly as usual, but of course with the multiplication
map mp and the unit 1p of Ap. Its diﬀerential is called dp−1. Notice that
ΩAp =

∞
q=0 ΩqAp and that ΩqA ≡ ΩqA1.

• We shall now deﬁne, for each p, a new object that we call “the iterated frame

L

algebra of order p of A”. We call

F0A = A
F1A = A ⊗ A = A2
F2A = A ⊗ A ⊗ A ⊗ A = A4
FpA = Fp−1A ⊗ Fp−1A = A2p

Therefore FpA is nothing else than the algebra A2p; its unit will be called
Its diﬀerential will be
1p
called δp, so that δp = d2p−1:

.
= 12p and its multiplication map is mp

.
= m2p.

Notice that δ0 = d0.

δp : FpA 7→ Fp+1A

• The basic idea underlying what follows is the fact that one can lift elements
of A to any of the Fp (see below) and also that Ω1Fp−1A is a vector subspace
of the algebra FpA so that diﬀerentials (of degree one) of appropriate lifts of
elements of A can be considered themselves as elements of a new algebra on
which one can operate again with another diﬀerential.

3 Lifts

Take f ∈ A = F0A. We extend it to all the FpA as follows: fp = fp−1 ⊗ 1p−1. We
also call f0 = f . Therefore, we have, for instance

f4 = f3 ⊗ 13

= f2 ⊗ 12 ⊗ 13
= f1 ⊗ 11 ⊗ 12 ⊗ 13
= f ⊗ 1 ⊗ 11 ⊗ 12 ⊗ 13 = f ⊗ 11+2+22+23=15 ∈ F4A = A16

It is clear that fp = f0 ⊗ 12p−1 Ultimately we shall write f for fp, for any p. This
useful abuse of notations amounts, in commutative diﬀerential geometry, to identify
a function on a manifold with its pullback in the tangent bundle and, actually, with
all its pullbacks in the tower of iterated tangent bundles.

Let us call LpA the algebra of lifts from A to FpA: these are tensors with one
element of A in the ﬁrst position, followed by a string of tensor products with 1’s
(namely 2p − 1 of them). Clearly LpA is an algebra isomorphic with A.

3

Not only can we lift f from F0A = A to FpA by the above trick, but also lift any
.
= ωq ⊗ 1q,
.
= ωp−1 ⊗ 1p−1. Clearly, there are many elements of FpA that are not lifts

ω ∈ FqA to all the FpA, (p > q) by the same method: call ωq
. . ., ωp
(neither lifts from A, nor lifts from FqA, with q < p).

.
= ω, ωq+1

The “elementary” lifting operation itself from FsA to Fs+1A will be denoted
by ρs (so that the index s of ρs reminds us where we start from). For instance, if
α ∈ FsA, then ρsα

.
= α ⊗ 1s ∈ Fs+1A.

Notation: we shall call ωp the lift of ω to FpA, wherever ω is located in the tower
of algebras FsA’s, when we want to remember in which such algebra we are. . . but
it is often convenient to make a notational abuse and write ω for ωp, for any p.

We shall say that u is a p-element if it belongs to FpA. Since LpA ⊂ FpA, it
is clear that every element of A deﬁnes inﬁnitely many p-elements (one for each p),
namely, the collection of its lifts.

We have deﬁned the lifting operator ρs (right multiplication by 1s) but we shall,
at times, also need to use the map λs (left multiplication by 1s) : if α ∈ FsA, then
λsα

.
= 1s ⊗ α ∈ Fs+1A.

4 Usual diﬀerentials and their lift in the tower of

FpA

Take f ∈ F0A = A and consider its usual diﬀerential δ0f = 1 ⊗ f − f ⊗ 1 in the
universal diﬀerential algebra ΩA. We may now consider δ0f as an element of F1A =
A ⊗ A and lift it to the whole tower of FpA, for instance (δ0f )3 = ρ2ρ1δ0f ∈ F3A.
Of course, we have (δ0f )1 ≡ δ0f .

There is no reason why we should stop at the level of F1A and we shall also
consider one-forms belonging to the Ω-algebra of F2A, F3A, etc along with their
own lifts. Actually, in the present paper, we only need to consider usual one-forms
and their lifts, more precisely, the elements of Ω1FpA that we identify with elements
of Fp+1A = FpA ⊗ FpA and that we subsequently lift to the whole tower of iterated
frame algebras.

Notice that, for any p, the usual diﬀerential dp−1 acting in the diﬀerential algebra
In particular, the usual
q Ωq(FpA) is such

Ω(Ap) =
diﬀerential δp−1 acting in the diﬀerential algebra Ω(FpA) =
that δ2

q Ωq(Ap) is such that d2

p−1 = 0, as usual.

L
p−1 = 0.

L

However, it should be clear that δp+1δp, for instance, or more generally dp+1dp,
is not zero. Take f ∈ F0A = A, we may build δ0f ∈ Ω1A ⊂ F1A. We can then
apply the diﬀerential δ1 and obtain δ1δ0f ∈ Ω1F1A ⊂ F2A. We can then again
apply the diﬀerential δ2 and obtain δ2δ1δ0f ∈ Ω1F2A ⊂ F3A. In this way, we build
.
δpf
= δp−1δp−2 . . . δ2δ1δ0f ∈ FpA. This is our ﬁrst example of a “form of order p”
and introduces, at the same time, the notation δpf , for f , an element of A.

0 = δ2

As usual, δ2

p = 0 but δ2 6= 0 and, more generally δp 6= 0. We
can also lift the quantity δpf , an element of FpA to any FqA, with q > p by using
right multiplication by the appropriate tensorial power of the unity.

1 = . . . = δ2

Let us conclude this subsection by stressing that Ω1Fp−1A ⊂ FpA so that δp−1

maps Fp−1A to FpA.

5 A set of generators for the iterated frame alge-

bras over A

5.1 The generators δI

Since FpA is a product of 2p tensorial powers of A, it is natural to deﬁne generators
δI f , f ∈ A, parametrized by the set of subsets of a set with p elements. Call
Ep = {p − 1, p − 2, . . . , 2, 1, 0} and let I ⊂ Ep. In order to specify in a unique way
the writing of I, we order the set in a decreasing way. Let us deﬁne δI by using
an example. We want to ﬁnd a set of generators in F5A. Choosing, for instance
I = {3, 1, 0} ⊂ E5, we deﬁne

δ{3,1,0}f

.
= ρ4 δ3 ρ2 δ1 δ0 f

Occurence of the needed δp is speciﬁed by the notation itself (here δ{3,1,0}) and the
appropriate lifts (the ρs) are associated with the complement of I in Ep. Notice
that when A is the commutative algebra of functions on a manifold, the quantity
δ{3,1,0}f is a function of 25 = 32 variables. From the deﬁnition of the lift operation
ρs and of the diﬀerential δs, it is easy to see that the set of δI f , when I runs in the
set of subsets of Ep, and when f ∈ A is indeed a family of generators for FpA.

It is instructive to work out explicitly, in terms of tensor products, such a set of

generators for F2A.

δ∅f = ρ1ρ0f
δ{0}f = ρ1δ0f
δ{1}f = δ1ρ0f
δ{1,0}f = δ1δ0f

This reads, explicitly

δ∅f = f ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1

δ{0}f = 1 ⊗ f ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 − f ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1
δ{1}f = 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ f ⊗ 1 − f ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1

δ{1,0}f = 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ f − 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ f ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ f ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 + f ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1

We see, on this example, that the above 4 types of monomials indeed span F2A
when f runs in A since we can invert this system to obtain

f ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 = δ∅f
1 ⊗ f ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 = δ{0}f + δ∅f
1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ f ⊗ 1 = δ{1}f + δ∅f
1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ f = δ{1,0}f + δ{1}f δ{0}f + δ∅f

It is also instructive to work out explicitly, in terms of tensor products, such a set
of generators for F3A.

δ∅f = ρ2ρ1ρ0f
δ{0}f = ρ2ρ1δ0f
δ{1}f = ρ2δ1ρ0f
δ{2}f = δ2ρ1ρ0f
δ{1,0}f = ρ2δ1δ0f
δ{2,0}f = δ2ρ1δ0f
δ{2,1}f = δ2δ1ρ0f
δ{2,1,0}f = δ2δ1δ0f

5

We shall leave to the reader the task of calculating the explicit expression of these
generators, in terms of tensor products. Again, one can see, on this example, that
the above 8 types of monomials indeed span F3A when f runs in A.

Another abuse of notation: We shall often remove totally the symbol ρn. Indeed,
it should be clear, when working in F3A, for example, that δ2δ0f denotes actually
δ{2,0}f = δ2ρ1δ0f since one needs to lift δ0f to F2A in order to be able to use the
diﬀerential δ2. Also, we shall write δp rather than δ{p} and even δ310 for δ{3,1,0},
for example, since no confusion should arise.

5.2 Right and left module multiplications

Our purpose, in this subsection, is to warn the reader against a possible subtle
mistake.

For any associative algebra B, the vector space Ω1B is both a left and right
module over B. This means in particular that, if a is an arbitrary element in B
and if ω is an arbitrary element in Ω1B, we have a × ω = (a ⊗ 1)(ω) where the
multiplication involved on the right hand side is the multiplication in the algebra
B ⊗ B whereas × denotes the left module multiplication of elements of Ω1B by
elements of B. In the same way we have ω × a = (ω)(1 ⊗ a). Notice that, in the ﬁrst
case, we lifted a from B to B ⊗ B by multiplying it tensorially from the right by the
unit, whereas, in the second case, we had to perform this tensorial multiplication
from the left.

Now, if we choose B = FpA, we see that Ω1FpA ⊂ Fp+1A is both a left and

right module over the algebra FpA. The above remarks are of course valid.

To appreciate the subtlety, let us continue to denote explicitly by × the module
multiplication and let us take f and g in A, so that g × δ0f ∈ Ω1A ⊂ F1A. We can
then consider δ1(g × δ0f ) which is an element of Ω1F1A ⊂ F2A, hence a right and
left module over F1A . The Leibniz rule being true, we have certainly

δ1(g × δ0f ) = (δ1g) × (δ0f ) + g × δ1(δ0f )

In order to check this relation, let us compute separately the left and right hand
sides of this relation.

The term appearing on the r.h.s. is easy to calculate.

g × δ0h = (g ⊗ 1)(1 ⊗ h − h ⊗ 1) = g ⊗ h − gh ⊗ 1

Therefore,

and therefore,

δ1(g×δ0h) = 11⊗(g×δ0h)−(g×δ0h)⊗11 = 1⊗1⊗g⊗h−1⊗1⊗gh⊗1−g⊗h⊗1⊗1+gh⊗1⊗1⊗1

δ1(δ0h) = 11⊗(δ0h)−(δ0h)⊗11 = 1⊗1⊗1⊗h−1⊗1⊗h⊗1−1⊗h⊗1⊗1+h⊗1⊗1⊗1

The last term of the r.h.s. is therefore also easy to calculate :

g × δ1δ0h = g ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ h − g ⊗ 1 ⊗ h ⊗ 1 − g ⊗ h ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 + gh ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1

One has however to be cautious with the ﬁrst term of the r.h.s, indeed, it reads

(δ1g) × (δ0h) = (δ1(g ⊗ 1)) × (1 ⊗ h − h ⊗ 1)

Replacing g by g ⊗ 1 in the above should be clear since we have to lift A to F1A, so
that (δ1(g ⊗ 1)) = 11 ⊗ (g ⊗ 1) − (g ⊗ 1) ⊗ 11. What may lead to a possible mistake is

6

the evaluation of the module multiplication × since we have here to take F2A as a
right module over F1A. In other words, one trades the module right multiplication
(×) with the algebra multiplication in A⊗4 (please, notice the appearance of the
left multiplication by 11) in such a way that

(11⊗(g⊗1)−(g⊗1)⊗11)×(1⊗h−h⊗1) = (11⊗(g⊗1)−(g⊗1)⊗11)(11⊗(1⊗h−h⊗1))

Finally,

(δ1g) × (δ0h) = 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ g ⊗ h − g ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ h − 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ gh ⊗ 1 + g ⊗ 1 ⊗ h ⊗ 1

adding the two contributions we see that the Leibniz rule is satisﬁed, as it should.
In section 3, we deﬁned the lifting operator ρs (right multiplication by 1s) but
we also deﬁned the map λs (left multiplication by 1s). Using both maps ρs and λs,
we see that the above Leibniz rule can be written

δ1(g × δ0h) = (δ1g) × (δ0h) + g × δ1(δ0h)

but also

The reader can also check that

δ1((ρ0g)(δ0h)) = (δ1ρ0g)(λ1δ0h) + (ρ1ρ0g)(δ1(δ0h))

λ1δ0h = δ{1,0}h + δ{0}h = δ1δ0h + ρ1δ0h

6 Higher diﬀerentials in non commutative geome-

try

For the reader directly jumping to this section, let us repeat that we are not trying
to deﬁne the analogue of De Rham n-forms (forms of degree n) in non commutative
diﬀerential geometry, for the good reason that it has been done and that it is well
known. The “diﬀerentials of higher order” of our title refer to objects whose com-
mutative analogue are the quantities already called dnf by mathematicians from
the previous century and that one can interpret, nowadays, in terms of iterated tan-
gent bundles. From the terminological point of view, we shall therefore distinguish
the (usual)“n − f orms” i.e. forms of degree n from the “Leibniz forms of order n”.
We already met one kind of diﬀerential forms of order n, namely, elements of
the kind δnf = δn−1 . . . δ1δ0f . We deﬁne inductively the space DnA of forms of
order n as follows.

DnA

.
= LnA × δn−1Dn−1A

The induction starts by taking D1A

.
= Ω1A = A × δ0A ⊂ F1A

In other words, since LnA is isomorphic with A, DnA is a left-module over A

generated by the diﬀerentials δn−1ω, where ω ∈ Dn−1A.

7

Identiﬁcation of DnA within FnA

Since DnA ⊂ FnA, it is a priori possible to express the diﬀerential forms of order
n in terms of the generators δI f , where I ⊂ En.

• The case D1A. Generators of F1A are of the kind δ∅f = f and δ{0}f = δ0f
so that forms of order one are just the “usual” universal one-forms (universal
forms of degree one) , i.e. D1A = Ω1A. With f, g ∈ A, they can be written
as linear combinations of f δ0g.

7

• The case D2A. Generators of F2A are of the kind δ∅f = f , δ{0}f = ρ1δ0f ,
δ{1}f = δ1ρ0f and δ{1,0}f = δ1δ0f . By deﬁnition, forms of order 2 are
obtained by taking the δ1 of forms of order 1 and by left-multiplying with
arbitrary elements in A. This left multiplication is the external module mul-
tiplication, but one can, as well, lift A to L2A ⊂ F2A and use the algebra
multiplication in the latter; the result is of course the same. With f, g, h ∈ A,
forms of order two are linear combinations of terms of the kind f δ1(gδ0h), and
we have seen, in section 5, that, explicitly (in terms of tensor products), such
forms read f (δ1ρ0g)(λ1δ0h) + f gδ1δ0h. It is convenient to introduce indexed
symbols aµ, aµν and xµ refering to arbitrary elements of A. When this algebra
is commutative (hence A = C(M ) for some topological compact space M ) we
can of course interpret these elements as functions on M . Expanding over the
generators of F2A, we see that a generic element of D2A can be written as
ω = aµδ1δ0xµ + aµν δ1xµ × δ0xν

Here, for the last time, we explicitly use the symbol × to distinguish the
module multiplication from the algebra multiplication. . . Moreover, both kinds
of terms appearing on the right hand side separately belong to D2A. Indeed,
from the deﬁnition, it is clear that aµδ1δ0xµ is a diﬀerential form of order 2;
moreover, we have δ1xµδ0xν = δ1(xµδ0xν ) − xµδ1δ0xν , which is the diﬀerence
of two terms already shown to belong to D2A, so that δ1xµδ0xν ∈ D2A as
well.

We shall introduce later a new associative product (and a new symbol) ⊙,
that will allow us to rewrite the above as

ω = aµδ2xµ + aµν δxµ ⊙ δxν
remember that the symbol δ2f was already introduced to denote δ{1,0}f =
δ1δ0f .

• The case D3A. Generators of F3A are of the kind δ∅f = f , δ{0}f , δ{1}f ,
δ{2}f , δ{1,0}f , δ{2,0}f , δ{2,1}f and δ{2,1,0}f . Forms of order 3 are obtained
by taking the δ2 of forms of order 2 and by left-multiplying with arbitrary
elements in A.
It is clear that δ{2,1,0}f ∈ D3A.
Then δ2xµδ{1,0}xν = δ2(xµδ{1,0}xν ) − xµδ{2,1,0}xν ∈ D3A as a diﬀerence of
two elements of D3A. Hence bµνδ2xµδ{1,0}xν ∈ D3A.
Also δ2(δ1xµδ0xν ) = δ{2,1}xµδ0xν + δ1xµδ{2,0}xν , so that aµν (δ{2,1}xµδ0xν +
δ1xµδ{2,0}xν) ∈ D3A.
Finally δ2xµδ1xν δ0xλ = δ2(xµδ1xν δ0xλ) − xµ(δ{2,1}xµδ0xν + δ1xµδ{2,0}xν )
therefore, aµνλδ2xµδ1xνδ0xλ ∈ D3A.
A generic element of D3A can therefore be written as

ω = aµδ{2,1,0}xµ + bµνδ2xµδ{1,0}xν + aµν (δ{2,1}xµδ0xν + δ1xµδ{2,0}xν ) +

aµνλδ2xµδ1xν δ0xλ

• The general case DsA.

It is already clear from the study of the previous
examples that inclusion of DsA in FsA is strict; moreover, it is easy to see
that, as a A-module, the former is of rank 2s−1 whereas the latter is of rank 2s.
Writing diﬀerential forms of order s in terms of generators of FsA, although
straightforward, is not always very illuminating, as one can infer from the
previous examples. As we shall see, it is much better to introduce the “old”
Leibniz notation together with a new product ⊙.

8 The graded diﬀerential algebra D, ⊙, δ

We want to deﬁne on D a structure of an associative (non commutative) algebra
(i.e. a product ⊙), for which δ will be a derivation mapping forms of order n to
forms of order n + 1. Warning: in order not to confuse the reader, we shall not call
this structure a “diﬀerential algebra”, ﬁrst because δ is not of square zero (none of
its powers is, a priori, equal to zero), next because, although D is ZZ-graded and δ
will be a derivation of D, it will not be a graded derivation. We ﬁrst explain how
to construct the new product and then show how to re-express all forms of order n
with this notation. The obtained algebra (D, ⊙) is a bimodule over A, but left and
right multiplications by elements of A do not coincide, so that A is an algebra over
Cl only. This is a priori clear in non commutative geometry, i.e. , when A is not
commutative but these two operations do not coincide even when A is commutative
may be a surprise...

8.1 The product ⊙

Here — and in general — latin letters like f, g, h . . . refer to elements of the algebra
A. Moreover, we decide ro write δω rather than δqω when ω is a form of order q.

Products of forms of order 0 by arbitrary forms of order q. Take f ∈ A and

σ an arbitrary form of order q, i.e. σ ∈ DqA. The (left) product with an ele-
ment of A is the usual product:

Products of forms of order 1 by arbitrary forms of order q. Next we deﬁne
the product of a one-form of the kind δf with an arbitrary σ. Notice that, in
what follows, the right hand side is already deﬁned:

f ⊙ σ = f σ

δf ⊙ σ

.
= δ(f σ) − f δσ

(f δg) ⊙ σ

.
= f (δg ⊙ σ)

An arbitrary form of order 1 can be written as f δg. One deﬁnes the product

Products of forms of order 2 by arbitrary forms of order q. We now deﬁne
the product of a form of order two, times an arbitrary form of order q. There
are two kinds of forms of order two: those of the kind δf ⊙ δg and those of
the kind δ2f . We deﬁne the products as

and

(δf ⊙ δg) ⊙ σ

.
= δf ⊙ (δg ⊙ σ)

δ2f ⊙ σ

.
= δ(δf ⊙ σ) − δf ⊙ δσ

Generalisation The general procedure should be clear. Using recusion on p, we
can deﬁne the product ⊙ of a form of order p times an arbitrary form ω, by
imposing associativity and the Leibniz rule. The only thing to check is that
this deﬁnition is indeed compatible with associativity of ⊙. We leave this task
to the reader.

8.2 Forms of order 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .

Using the ⊙ product, one can write all the higher diﬀerential forms of order n
in a very simple way since it allows us to use the “old” Leibniz notation (as in
the commutative case, see [7]). Again, in what follow, letters f, g, h, i, k . . . refer
to elements in A. As an example, we give the structure of all possible types of
diﬀerential forms of order 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and express each of them in terms of the
diﬀerential operators δp and more generally, in terms of the generators δI . We not
write explicitly the lifts ρs (or λs).

Forms of order 1. Elements of D1A are linear combinations of f δg where

Forms of order 2. Elements of D2A are linear combinations of two types: f δ2g

and f δg ⊙ δh, where

δg = δ0g

δ2g = δ1δ0g
δg ⊙ δh = δ1gδ0h

Forms of order 3. Elements of D3A are linear combinations of four types: f δ3g,

f (δg ⊙ δ2h), f (δ2g ⊙ δh), and f (δg ⊙ δh ⊙ δi), where

The only non obvious kind of terms is the third one;
diﬀerence, as explained before, by imposing the Leibniz rule.

it is obtained as a

δ3g = δ2δ1δ0g
δg ⊙ δ2h = δ2gδ10h
δ2g ⊙ δh = δ21gδ0h + δ1gδ20h − δ2gδ10h

δg ⊙ δh ⊙ δi = δ2gδ1hδ0i

δ2g ⊙ δh = δ(δg ⊙ δh) − δg ⊙ δ2h
= δ2(δ1gδ0h) − δ2gδ10h
= δ2δ1gδ0h + δ1gδ20h − δ2gδ10h

Forms of order 4. Elements of D4A are linear combinations of eight types: kδ4f ,
k(δf ⊙δ3g), k(δf ⊙δ2g⊙δh), k(δf ⊙δg⊙δ2h), k(δf ⊙δg⊙δh⊙δi), k(δ2f ⊙δ2g),
k(δ2f ⊙ δg ⊙ δh), k(δ3f ⊙ δg).
These eight diﬀerentials can be expressed in terms of the 24 = 16 generators
δI , with I ⊂ {3, 2, 1, 0}, as follows

δ4f = δ3210f
δf ⊙ δ3g = δ3f δ210g

δf ⊙ δ2g ⊙ δh = δ3f (δ21gδ0h + δ1gδ20h − δ2gδ10h)

= δ3f δ21gδ0h + δ3f δ1gδ20h − δ3f δ2gδ10h

δf ⊙ δg ⊙ δ2h = δ3f (δ2gδ10h) = δ3f δ2gδ10h

δf ⊙ δg ⊙ δh ⊙ δi = δ3f δ2gδ1hδ0i

δ2f ⊙ δ2g = δ(δf ⊙ δ2g) − δf ⊙ δ3g = δ3(δ2f δ10g) − δ3f δ210g

= δ32f δ10g + δ2f δ310g − δ3f δ210g
δ2f ⊙ δg ⊙ δh = δ(δf ⊙ δg ⊙ δh) − δf ⊙ δ2g ⊙ δh − δf ⊙ δg ⊙ δ2h

10

= δ3(δ2f δ1gδ0h) − (δ3f δ21gδ0h + δ3f δ1gδ20h − δ3f δ2gδ10h) − δ3f δ2gδ10h
= δ32f δ1gδ0h + δ2f δ31gδ0h + δ2f δ1gδ30h − δ3f δ21gδ0h

−δ3f δ1gδ20h + δ3f δ2gδ10h − δ3f δ2gδ10h

δ3f ⊙ δg = δ(δ2f ⊙ δg) − δ2f ⊙ δ2g

= δ3(δ21f δ0g + δ1f δ20g − δ2f δ10g) − δ32f δ10g

−δ2f δ310g + δ3f δ210g

= δ321f δ0g + δ21f δ30g + δ31f δ20g + δ1f δ320g

−δ32f δ10g − δ2f δ310g − δ32f δ10g − δ2f δ310g + δ3f δ210g

We see clearly on this example the interest of the Leibniz notation. For instance,
the form of order 4 equal to δ3f ⊙ δg is quite a complicated object when written in
terms of the diﬀerentials δI of the iterated frame algebras! It is even worse (and at
least uses a lot of space) if we write it explicitly in terms of tensor products since
it is an element of A⊗16.

9 Representations of higher diﬀerentials. Exam-

ples

In order to deﬁne diﬀerential forms of order n we made use of some prior knowledge
on the algebras of universal forms Ω(Fp(A)) associated with appropriate iterated
frame algebras, along with their diﬀerentials δp = d2p−1. We could have also used
homomorphic images of these algebras of universal forms, for instance, in the case
where A is commutative, we could have used De Rham p-forms rather than func-
tions of p variables vanishing on consecutive diagonals. We shall illustrate such a
possibility below.

9.1 A commutative example

9.1.1 Universal forms

Take A = C(M ), the algebra of continuous functions on a compact topological
space. Elements of Ω1A are linear combinations of elements of the kind f δg =
f ⊗g −f g ⊗1, so that they can be identiﬁed with functions of two variables vanishing
on the diagonal , i.e. [f δg](x, y) = f (x)g(y) − f (x)g(x) = f (x)(g(y) − g(x)). We do
not need to use ΩsA, s > 1 , i.e. universal forms of dergree s, in this paper, but
let us mention, for illustration purposes, that its elements can be identiﬁed with
functions of s + 1 variables vanishing on pairwise diagonals; for instance, elements
of Ω3A, are linear combinations of functions of 4 variables, of the kind

[f δgδhδk](x, y, z, t) = f (x)(g(y) − g(x))(h(z) − h(y))(k(t) − k(z)).

Let us compare this with forms of order s, i.e. elements DsA. A priori, they are
included in FsA which is itself isomorphic with A2s , so that these elements can be
considered as functions of 2s variables over the space M .

We already know that D1A = Ω1A so that forms of order 1 are of the kind

f δg = f ⊗ g − f g ⊗ 1

These forms, as it is well known, can be identiﬁed with functions of 2 variables that
vanish on the diagonal, since

[f δg](x, y) = f (x)g(y) − f (x)g(x) = f (x)(g(y) − g(x))

11

Forms of order 2, i.e. elements of D2A can be of the type f δ2g, in which case

(see section 5.2)

f δ2g = f δ1δ0g

So that

= f (11 ⊗ (1 ⊗ g − g ⊗ 1) − (1 ⊗ g − g ⊗ 1) ⊗ 11)

f ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ g − f ⊗ 1 ⊗ g ⊗ 1 − f ⊗ g ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 + f g ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1

[f δ2g](x, y, z, t) = f (x)g(t) − f (x)g(z) − f (x)g(y) + f (x)g(x)

= f (x)((g(t) − g(z)) − (g(y) − g(x))))

Note that such forms can be identiﬁed with functions of 4 variables x, y, z, t that
vanish when both x = y and z = t or when both x = z and y = t.
. Forms of
order 2 can also be of the type f δg ⊙ δh, in which case (see section 5.2)

f δg ⊙ δh = f δ1ρ0gλ1δ0h

= f ⊗ 1 ⊗ g ⊗ h − f g ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ h − f ⊗ 1 ⊗ gh ⊗ 1 + f g ⊗ 1 ⊗ h ⊗ 1)

So that

[f δg ⊙ δh](x, y, z, t) = f (x)(g(z) − g(x))(h(t) − h(z))

Notice that such functions of 4 variables x, y, z, t vanish when both x = z and z = t.

9.1.2 local forms

We now suppose that M is a compact smooth manifold, take A = C∞(M ), and
replace the algebras of universal forms ΩA by the usual De Rham complex ΛM ,
i.e. non local forms [δf ](x, y) = f (y) − f (x) (discrete diﬀerences) by the usual
diﬀerentials df = ∂f
∂xµ dxµ, where {xµ} is some local coordinate system. These xµ
are themselves elements of A. We shall continue to use the notation δf . The
diﬀerential form of order 2, that we called δ2f can, a priori, be expanded on the
two types of generators that span D2A, i.e. ,

δ2f = aµν δxµ ⊙ δxν + bµδ2xµ

The form of order one δf is equal to the usual one-form δ0f , therefore δf =
(∂µf )δxµ, where ∂µ denotes the coordinate frame ∂µ
∂xµ , so that δ2f = δ(∂µf )⊙
δxµ + (∂µf )δ2xµ. We have therefore to identify bµ with the ﬁrst derivatives ∂µf and
identify aµν with the second derivatives ∂µν f of f with respect to this coordinate
frame.

.
= ∂

Let us take for instance M = IR2, and call (x, y)

.
= (x1, x2). Then

δ2f = f ′′

xxδx ⊙ δx + f ′′

yyδy ⊙ δy + f ′′

xyδx ⊙ δy + f ′′

yxδy ⊙ δx + f ′

xδ2x + f ′

yδ2y

We shall suppress the symbol ⊙ in the remaining part of this section. Using the
xy = f ′′
property f ′′
yx, we recover a result known to mathematicians of the XIX
century, namely that

δ2f = f ′′

xxδx2 + f ′′

yyδy2 + 2f ′′

xyδxδy + f ′

xδ2x + f ′

yδ2y

is an “intrinsic” quantity, hence invariant under a change of variables (coordinate
system). This remark can be used as follows. Let x = x(u, v) and y = y(u, v) a

12

change of variables. We ﬁrst write

δx = x′
δy = y′
δ2x = x′′
δ2y = y′′

uvδuδv + x′
uvδuδv + y′

uδ2u + x′
uδ2u + y′

vδ2v
vδ2v

and replace these expressions by their values in δ2f . We obtain

Notice that, if the change of variables is linear, we can forget about the term f ′
vδ2v in the expression of δ2f when we want to calculate the expression of f ′′
f ′
.. , since,
in this case, x′′
.. = 0. However, for an arbitrary change of variables, this term
should be present! We see that the usual second order diﬀerential of f is “bad” in
the sense that it presisely forgets the contribution of this term. This fact (along
with some lore concerning the deﬁnition of diﬀerentials of higher order) was well
known to Bertrand or Hadamard ([1], [2], [3] and reﬂects the fact that, transforming
between coordinate systems requires that the second derivative be accompanied by
the ﬁrst. . . Instead of the chain rule for ﬁrst derivatives, dφ/dv = dφ/du du/dv,
we have something more complicated for second derivatives, namely, d2φ/dv2 =
d2φ/du2 (du/dv)2 + dφ/du d2u/dv2. These two rules of transformation for ﬁrst and
second derivatives compress into the following matrix equation:

The interested reader may look at [6] for an amusing —and instructing— elaboration
along these lines.

9.2 The example of algebra of p × p matrices

Let A be the algebra of p× p matrices over the complex numbers. For instance, take
p = 2. It is then easy to construct the diﬀerentials of order 1, 2, 3 . . . by using the
explicit description of these objects in terms of tensor products and by performing
tensor products of matrices. Call f i

j the matrix elements of the 2 × 2 matrix f .

Such explicit calculations are very easy to handle with the help of a computer

but obviously require a lot of space when using only pen and paper!

The reader should carefully distinguish a form of degree 2 like δ0f δ0g (an element
of Ω2A), which, in the present example is a 8 × 8 matrix, from a Leibniz form of
order 2 like δf δg

.
= δ1f δ0g which, in the present example, is a 16 × 16 matrix.

9.3 The algebra Cl ⊕ Cl of functions over two points

Consider a discrete set {L, R} with two elements that we call L and R. Call x
.
.
the coordinate function x(L)
=
= 0 and y the coordinate function y(L)
.
= 1. Notice that xy = yx = 0, x2 = x, y2 = y and x + y = 1 where 1 is
0, y(R)
the unit function 1(L) = 1, 1(R) = 1. An arbitrary element of the associative (and
commutative) algebra A generated by x and y can be written λx + µy (where λ and

.
= 1, x(R)

λ 0
.
0 µ (cid:19)

(cid:18)

µ are two complex numbers) and can be represented as a diagonal matrix

One can write A = Cl x ⊕ Cl y and is isomorphic with Cl ⊕ Cl .

We now introduce a diﬀerential δ0 satisfying δ2

0 = 0, δ01 = 0 and the usual
Leibniz rule, along with formal symbols δ0x and δ0y. It is clear that Ω1, the space
of diﬀerentials of degree 1 is generated by the two independent quantities xδ0x and
yδ0y. Indeed, the relation x + y = 1 implies δ0x + δ0y = 0, the relations x2 = x
and y2 = y imply (δ0x)x + x(δ0x) = (δ0x), therefore (δ0x)x = (1 − x)δ0x and
(δ0y)y = (1 − y)δ0y. This implies also, for example δ0x = 1δ0x = xδ0x + yδ0x,
xδ0x = −xδ0y, yδ0x = (1 − x)δ0x, (δ0x)x = yδ0x = −yδ0y etc .

More generally, Ωp, the space of diﬀerentials of degree p is also 2-dimensional.
The above relations indeed imply that a base of this vector space is given by
{xδ0xδ0x . . . δ0x, yδ0yδ0y . . . δ0y}.

As we already know, the space Ω =

p Ωp is an algebra: we multiply forms freely
but take into account the Leibniz rule. Notice that xδ0x = x⊗x−x2⊗1 = x⊗x−x⊗1
since x2 = x. In the same way yδ0y = y ⊗ y − y ⊗ 1. Therefore

L

[xδ0x](L, L) = 0

and [yδ0y](L, L) = 0
[xδ0x](L, R) = −1 and [yδ0y](L, R) = 0

[xδ0x](R, L) = 0
[xδ0x](R, R) = 0

and [yδ0y](R, L) = −1
and [yδ0y](R, R) = 0

We knew, priori that these two functions had to vanish on the diagonal, i.e. on the
arguments (L, L) and (R, R).

Our main interest, in this paper, is not in the study of spaces ΩpA, with p > 1
but in the spaces DqA. Using the fact that D2A is spanned by forms of the type
f δ2g or of the type f δg ⊙ δh, the reader will easily show that D2A is spanned by
the four monomials xδ2x, yδ2y, xδxδx and yδyδy (again we do not write explicitly
.
the symbol ⊙). Here δ2x
= δ1δ0x where δ1 is the diﬀerential in Ω1A ⊗ A). We also
had to use relations such as δ2x = −δ2y, xδ2x + yδ2x = δ2x, etc coming from the
relations in the algebra A.

Explicitly, one obtains, for instance (use x2 = x, y2 = y, xy = 0)

xδ2x = x ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ x − x ⊗ 1 ⊗ x ⊗ 1 − x ⊗ x ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 + x ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1

and

xδxδx = x ⊗ 1 ⊗ x ⊗ x − x ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ x

Note that the last two terms appearing in the general expression of f δgδh cancel
each other.

For illustration, the reader may convince himself that the only non-zero values

of [xδ2x](x1, x2, x3, x4) are the following ones:

[xδ2x](L, L, L, R) = −1,
[xδ2x](L, R, R, R) = −1,

[xδ2x](L, L, R, L) = 1,
[xδ2x](L, R, R, L) = 2,

[xδ2x](L, R, L, L) = −1,

In the same way, one can show that D3A is spanned by the eight types 8 = 2(3−1) ×2
of monomials

xδ3x, yδ3y (with a structuref δ3g),
xδxδ2x, yδyδ2y (with a structuref δgδ2h),

xδ2δx, yδ2yδy (with a structuref δ2gδh),
x(δx)3, y(δy)3 (with a structuref δgδhδu)

Since elements of A can be represented by diagonal 2 × 2 matrices, this last example
can be considered as a particular case of the previous one. Setting f = diag(λ, µ),
and ǫ = µ − λ, we obtain for instance, δf = diag(0, −ǫ, ǫ, 0) and

δ2f = diag(0, −ǫ, ǫ, 0, −ǫ, −2ǫ, 0, −ǫ, ǫ, 0, 2ǫ, ǫ, 0, −ǫ, ǫ, 0)

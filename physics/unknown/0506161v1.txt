Abstract 
 
In this work we study spin-glass (SG) like behavior in the dynamics of multiple agents in a social 
or economic context using interactions which are similar to the physical case.  The different 
preferences shown by individual agents are represented by orientations of spin-like variables.  
Because of limited resources, each agent tries to maximize her total utility function, giving a 
prescription for the dynamics of the system similar to the evolution resulting from the 
optimization of the interaction of a SG. The coupling between agents for different attributes may 
be positive or negative, as in a physical SG system, forming “frustrations” from the ensuing 
conflicts, with the system trying to find an overall equilibrium, but in vain, so that we observe 
oscillations. The couplings are provided by matrices corresponding to each attribute and each 
agent, which are allowed to have some fixed bias, indicating the unchangeable component of the 
make up of the agents from genetic factors or lasting environmental influences, and also contain a 
random part from environmental noise, i.e. the cumulative stochastic effect of lumped factors not 
explicitly accounted for in the model. In a simulation of a small world with a small number of 
agents and attributes we observe, for particular choices of the coupling matrices, interesting 
variations of behavior patterns, including oscillations with different long and short term behavior 
of punctuated equilibria. We also show that if the “spin” variables are extended to become co-
ordinate-like variables, the interaction appears like the distance function in differential geometry, 
with the coupling matrices forming an indefinite metric in the state space of the system. We 
comment on the relevance and consequences of equations of motion that may be derived from 
such an analogy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I. Introduction 
 
In economic and social contexts the individual agents show different preferences, which may be 
in part due to specific genetic make up and in part due to socio-cultural and educational 
background, i.e. lasting effects of the environment. On the other hand in economics we usually 
assume that agents behave rationally. Since preferences obviously differ, what appears to be 
rational to one agent may not be so to another. As each agent tries to maximize her satisfaction or 
utility function, she uses her perception of the other agents’ preferences, which may not be what 
those agents themselves actually perceive. There may be deliberate bluffing also in a game 
theoretic [1] sense if agents consider that misleading other agents may be advantageous to them 
since resources are limited.  
 
In a more general context, we have tried to explain the non-quantifiable human needs [2] and the 
diversity in utility functions by taking into account Gödel's incompleteness theorem [3].  
Strategies to maximize satisfaction might be rational, but we have argued that the needs 
themselves might not be a "common rational" set of constants. As any logic system is based on a 
set of axioms that are by themselves not provable within the logic system itself, and 
the axioms or sets of information are acquired by each agent individually by interacting with its 
environment and other agents, this individuality will be reflected in the choices of each agent.  
Some needs, however, might be very common and many of these are quantifiable easily in terms 
of material or opportunity cost, whereas some other needs are almost impossible to express in 
terms of maneuverable quantities. 
 
The utility function or the satisfaction derived from specific items as measured by the opportunity 
cost is based on the question of relative security of the 'self' obtained from the transaction, and as 
each agent tries to optimize her  total satisfaction independently, with respect to some items it 
may be advantageous to align with other agents with similar orientations, and with respect to 
some others the choice for individual satisfaction may lead to opposite orientations, as in a 
minority game. Because of conflicting couplings of some attributes of the agents, there may be 
"frustration" as in a spin-glass model in physics [4, 5], with the system trying to find an overall 
equilibrium, but in vain, so that we observe oscillations of the orientations of the agents according 
to their individuality as well as their interaction with other agents, and also the linking weights 
between the agent pairs. 
 
In the next section we first summarize the idea of a physical spin-glass, in section 3 we present 
our multi-agent social model analogous to a spin-glass system, in section 4 we formulate a 
procedure for the simulation of a small system and in section 5 we show the results of the 
simulation, in section 5 we outline a novel differential geometric picture of the interaction and 
discuss some of its consequences, and in section 6 we present our conclusions. 
 
 
     
    
 

II. Spin-Glass Models 
 
The simplest soluble model in magnetism is the Ising model, which consists of a lattice of spins 
with only one component which can take the values “1” or “-1”, i.e. which can only flip. The 
Hamiltonian is described by  
 
 
H

                                                                                                         (1)

where the index i or k  of the spin s is the label of the location site of the spin in the lattice, the 
first sum is over all nearest neighbor pairs, J being the nearest neighbor coupling strength of the 
spins, which is a constant  and h is a constant  external magnetic field. The Ising model is the 
simplest physical system that shows a nontrivial phase transition at nonzero temperature. The 
two-dimensional Ising model has been exactly solved by Onsager [6], but higher dimensions can 
only be simulated or approximated. 
 
The spin-glass (SG) model describes a system with random coupling  Jij between the spins si and 
sj, which can even change sign. So some links can behave as ferromagnetic and some as 
antiferromagnetic, and the inconsistency can produce “frustrations”. Even a slight change in 
temperature can produce a totally different state with no overlap with the previous one. In a SG 
the order parameter is not the mean spin, which is zero, but the average variance, which makes it 
more complicated and interesting.  
 
There are two principal types of SG, the Edwards-Anderson model [4] and the Sherrington-
Kirkpatrick model [5]. In the latter all spins interact with all spins, and not just with nearest 
neighbors as in the Ising model.  
 
A mathematical trick used to study SG systems is replica symmetry [4, 7], where a large number 
of identical systems are averaged over to calculate free energy and thermodynamic properties. In 
this case the spins acquire one more index to indicate the particular replica to which it belongs:

Extra indices are also introduced when, unlike the Ising case, the spin is a multi-component 
vector, as in the two-dimensional (X-Y) model and the three-dimensional Heisenberg model. 
 
 
III. Social Clusters and SG 
 
In the context of our social network many of the features of the usual physical SG are quite apt, 
but some need further generalization, because the social dynamics is more complex than that of 
an assembly of identical spins. 
 
The utility function may represented by the negative of a spin-glass form Hamiltonian

least partially, randomly like a spin-glass, and/or may vary with learning and adaptation. The 
variable ha

If there are n agents and m attributes we have a total of mXm matrices each of size nXn. This 
includes also self-interaction of different attributes of agents -Jab
physical case, because it would trivially add the fixed magnitude of each orientation vector in that 
case. In the socio-economic context this term is quite important as it adds the problem of the need 
for self-consistency of different attributes of any agent without involving other agents. The J 
coupling matrices are not in general diagonal and different attributes of different agents should be 
allowed to interact. For example, the preference of an agent for a particular commodity such as an 
expensive car may also affect the choice of a neighbor for another commodity which too is 
expensive.   
 
The interaction with nature or an agent’s genetic make-up is represented by the second term. 
Analogous to an external magnetic field we have a factor that tries to orient each agent, but the 
magnitude of the field now depends both on the agent and the attribute nature wants to influence, 
giving it two indices.  
 
We have already noted that for different agents and different attributes, some links may have 
positive values (bandwagon effect - trying to align agents in the same direction where co-
operative orientation is more satisfying [8]) and some may have negative values (where, as in a 
minority game, it is more satisfactory to be different). Hence the ferro-antiferro mixture creates a 
SG-type system. However, unlike an Ising SG with only +1 and -1 values of the spin, in the 
socio-economic context we have to enlarge the domain of choices considerably, say from –s to 
+s, as is the case for the measured component of a three-dimensional spin vector s in quantum 
mechanics. Later in this paper we shall also consider the continuum limit. 
 
Unlike a usual SG model, it may be more appropriate in a socio-economic system to have 
nonzero average <J> couplings because the couplings may have fixed nonzero biases. We have 
commented on the impossibility of quantifying exactly all the factors that build up the utility 
function (or the concept of ‘self” of an agent in a non-economic context) in terms of a 
manageably small number of attribute parameters. The interaction of undefined remaining 
parameters may be simulated by adding to the fixed bias matrix elements a random part, whereas 
in a usual SG the whole coupling is random. The presence of this element of randomness 
indicates the possibility of such a system having some usual features of SG. 
 
The attribute index (superscript) is similar to the different components of a vector, but as J 
depends on it too, in nontrivial cases we would not get a normal scalar product between the spins 
as in a Heisenberg magnet. Though one can formulate an elliptical system with broken rotational 
for Heisenberg-type magnets, in this case as the sign of the J components can also change, we 
have effectively a noncompact attribute space  which makes any comparison with Heisenberg 
magnets almost irrelevant. If we try to interpret these indices as replica indices, then too we have 

ik to keep the dimensionality small. 

such grossly broken replica symmetry on account of the varying J’s, that the analogy, though 
intriguing, cannot serve any useful purpose. 
 
The total preference make-up of an agent or his ‘self’ should involve an extremely large number 
of attributes. This problem is already quite complex, more so than the physical models with small 
dimensionality, and hence it necessitates the selection of the most important attributes, i.e. those 
with the highest link weights Jab
 
The reduction of variables is also justified on grounds other than those of mathematical 
expediency. Even if we start with the assumption that a perfect definition of an agent at a certain 
time point may need infinitely many variables and preferences, the perception of "self" is limited 
with only a finite number of variables at a certain time point, as realizing a genetic variable and 
optimizing a need requires the expenditure of time and energy, and each agent is endowed with 
only a limited amount of such.  As a result, at each time point, an agent can be approximated to a 
finite number of variables with high weight terms in the array. 
 
Some of the weights are difficult to shift and are always high [9]. In an abstract sense, we can say 
that there is a variable called existence, which, when flipped, an agent ceases to exist, and some 
variables are attached to that with a high non-modifiable or difficult to update weight.  For 
example, the utility eating is difficult to shift weight from.  If an agent does not consider it 
important to eat, he or she will cease to live [10]               .   
 
Again, some of these variables have a high weight because it can be thought that the agent is 
connected with the environment with an inflexible weight regarding those variables.  The 
environment can be thought of as a heat bath the agent is in contact with.  Hence, the variables of 
the environment can be taken as a thermodynamic average of a large ensemble, and are more 
fixed relative to the variables an individual agent possesses.  Hence, it is safe to assume  
that agent-agent interactions can more easily flip variables than can agent-environment 
interactions. 
 
IV. Simulation of a Small World 
 
An exact analytic solution is possible for the simple Ising model and that too only for dimension 
2. For a heterogeneous system with random component in the links like the one described above, 
simulation may be the only realistic method of studying the system. But even simulations become 
extremely time-consuming for large values of the number of agents or attributes. We have tried in 
this work to observe the dynamics of a world with three agents only, and each agent having three 
attributes only. The utility function is described by the negative of the explicit Hamiltonian

each agent tries to maximize its utility, i.e. minimize H. The saturation value |s| = smax   is taken to 
be 5, so that even if Eq. 5 suggests a change to a higher |s|, we keep it fixed at the old value.  
 
We experimented with different fixed components of the matrices A, B and h, and also with 
different relative weights of the fixed and random components. Among the elements in every 
coupling matrix we had fixed components of both positive and negative signs. The random 
components of the elements were given three different scales 1) 1X the magnitude as the fixed 
components, 2) 0.3 X the magnitude of the fixed components, and 3) 0.1X  the magnitude of the 
fixed components to understand the relative importance of the fixed and random components in 
determining the qualitative dynamical behavior of the system. As the coupling matrices change 
slowly compared to the spin changes, the situation is similar to annealing. 
 
 
V. Results of Simulation 
 
We have nine different evolutions for the nine sa
three times with the three different scales of randomness described above. However, an 
examination of all the developments shows a number of typical patterns, and we show the 
prototypes in Figs. 1-6. 
  
In Fig. 1 we see an interesting feature in the time evolution of one agent’s [#1] one attribute [#2]. 
It shows punctuated equilibria [11, 12], i.e. periods of static equilibrium punctuated by spurts of 
rapid changes. This phenomenon has been observed experimentally in geological evolution in 
fossil records.  In social and economic contexts also periods of sudden changes interspersed with 
periods of stability are fairly common.

Fig.2 shows the behavior characteristic of most other sa
Surprisingly, neither the frequency, nor the amplitude of the oscillations seem to show much 
fluctuation even when the randomness scale is large. It is well-known that the evolution of a 
coupled set of variables with opposite coupling signs yields an oscillation. In SG language, a 
frustrated system cannot find equilibrium and keeps oscillating.

In Fig 3, we notice unexpected large time scale changes. It appears that the base of oscillations 
can reverse signs fairly rapidly so that there is a square wave oscillation with a much larger 
period than the period of short term oscillations. So, even in the simple example considered, we 
see the origin of a second time period from the dynamics of the system as a whole as distinct 
from the simple short time oscillations resulting from more direct conflicting interactions. 
 
In Fig.4 we note a more gradual shift of base of short–term oscillations, which forms longer term 
oscillating trends. This is a familiar picture in socio-economic contexts, for example in stock-
market indices.

It is also possible to observe short-term of long-term near chaotic behavior for the same attribute 
of the same agent ( s2

A simple method of observing the correlation between the same attribute of the different agents, 
which is important in socio-economic systems, may be the difference between the corresponding 
spin components. In Figs. 7 and 8 we see that in our model between the same two agents one 
attribute has a quasi-chaotic difference, and another is quite regular.

VI.  Coupling  as a Metric in State Space 
 
 
If we use the combined notation  A= (a, i), B= (b, j), then the interaction may be written as  
 
H = - gAB  XA XB                                               
 
where we have now made the   “spin” (orientation) domain of the spin variable very large and 
continuous and have used the integrted vector symbol XA for it. This does not  mean we are 
interested in actually allowing an agent to have infinite preference for any attribute, because the 
coupling gAB= JAB can be made a function of XA , and made to vanish asymptotically for high 
values of any component of XA .   
 
Now, gAB  can be treated as a metric, and hence if we treat XA  as the co-ordinate of the system in 
state space ( it contains the preference of every agent for every item/commodity in the system). 
As H in Eq. 6 is now similar to the distance function of differential gemometry we can write the 
equivalent “action” integral as the time integral of the Lagrangian [13]

the subscripts after comma denoting partial differentiation with respect to the corresponding 
component of X.  
 
Eq.8 relates the acceleration of change of state to a force coming from the curvature of the state 
space, which is contained in the functional relationship of the metric  g  (coupling J) on the state 
vector X.  For a constant metric this is zero, giving inertial effects full control. In such a situation 
the preference variables   XA  may run away to infinity, which is not possible in a socio-economic 
system.   
 
A simple compactification of the space in terms of projective space or a multidimensional sphere 
would not work, because it is not possible to identify points by going in opposing directions in a 
socio-economic system. However, as we have mentioned, gAB   may contain damping factors for 
any large component of XA  . The situation reminds us of Fisher-Rao [14] metrics related to 
probability distribution functions (pdf). If the pdf is parametrized by the vector aA, then a 
dispersion from the optimal value gives a distance between the new pdf and the old one as : 
 
ds2  = gAB  daA daB 
 
where

The use of logarithm is justified  by the functional relationship between probabilty and 
information or entropy. In a socio-economic context changes are meanignful almost always only 
in terms of fractions (percentage growth, literacy rate, employment, mortality etc.) so that the 
perceived value of a quantity is actually its logarithm, i.e. if we define 
 
YA  = log  XA                                                                                                                                (12) 
 
Then a new definitionof utility in terms of these variables gives a more conservative metric 
 
 ds2  = gAB  dYA dYB   = gAB  (dXA /XA) (dXB/XB) 
 
which tries to decouple attributes carrying high XA values, preventing run-away systems. The 
remaining gAB  may contain further X dependence. 
 
In a more elaborate model, a finite-temperature system may have a superposition of geometries 
with different metrics with corresponding probabilites.

VII. Conclusions 
 
We have seen that many of the concepts of the physical SG system are applicable to a socio-
economic system, though generalizations going beyond strict physical constraints are also 
necessary. Our simulation of a small world with only three agents with three variable attributes 
which interact produced a surprisingly rich diversity of dynamical behavior and we have seen that 
both long and short term periodicties are noticeable as well as nearly chaotic patterns,  which are 
the consequences of interaction between fixed and random components of the links between the 
agents and an external field representing nature. 
 
Smallness of randomness in links gives greater regularity in the dynamic pattern, usually 
symmetric oscillations for some interesting attributes,  and punctuated equilibrium for some 
attributes of some agents. For small randomness, long term behavior shows nothing new, but for 
large randomness long term behavior can show reversals of short term patterns at long intervals. 
The presence of an external field of same magnitude as links also imposes greater regularity, 
often with periodic long term patterns absent when, for the same randomness, there is  no such 
field. Even when short term patterns look chaotic, well-defined long term patterns are often 
discernible. Correlation patterns are visible in some attributes, even when high randomness is 
present. 
 
We have also seen that the state of a small system can be defined by a state vector and the 
coupling matrix then acts as a metric in the state space allowing us to investigate certain 
charactereistics of the system dynamics using the methods of differential geometry. A 
thermodynamic formulation may indicate the possibility of phase transitions, which is under 
investigation now.

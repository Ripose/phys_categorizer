Abstract 

Extensive beam-based feedback systems are planned as 
an  integral  part  of  the  Next  Linear  Collider  (NLC) 
control  system.  Wakefield  effects  are  a  significant 
influence  on  the  feedback  design,  imposing  both 
architectural and algorithmic constraints. Studies are in 
progress to assure the optimal selection of devices and 
to  refine  and  confirm  the  algorithms  for  the  system 
design. We show the results of initial simulations, along 
with  evaluations  of  system  response  for  various 
conditions  of  ground  motion  and  other  operational 
disturbances. 

1  INTRODUCTION  

is 

intended 

to  operate  on 

The  NLC  design  specifies  a  sequence  of  beam-based 
trajectory feedback systems along the main linacs. This 
feedback 
the  average 
properties of a pulse train of 95 bunches at a repetition 
rate  of  120  Hz.  The  measurements  are  beam  position 
monitor (BPM) readings for a single pulse which may 
be averaged over a number of bunches. The corrections 
are primarily applied with fast dipole magnets but other 
devices were also studied. The feedback is designed to 
damp low frequency trajectory errors up to about 5 Hz. 
The  system  is  modeled  after  the  generalized  feedback 
developed at the SLC [1] with improvements to provide 
more optimal response for the NLC. 

Simulations of the NLC linac feedback systems have 
been performed in a Matlab environment [2] using the 
LIAR program [3] for tracking and beam calculations. 
Beam tests have also been done on the SLAC linac to 
confirm the simulation results [4]. 

2  MULTI-CASCADE SIMULATIONS 

these 

systems  need 

In the main linacs of both the SLC and NLC design, a 
series of feedbacks are used to keep the beam trajectory 
well  centered  in  the  quadrupoles  and  structures.  To 
avoid  overcorrection  and  ringing  in  response  to  an 
incoming  disturbance, 
to 
communicate  beam  information.  In  the  SLC,  a  simple 
one-to-one  "cascade"  system  between 
loops  was 
implemented.  Each  feedback  controlled  a  number  of 
beam states which were typically fitted beam positions 
and angles at a single point.  On each beam pulse, these

states  were  recalculated  and  the  information passed to 
the  next  downstream  loop  before  a  correction  was 
implemented.  The  downstream  feedback  would  then 
use  transport  matrices  to  calculate  the  corresponding 
local  states  and  subtract  these  from  the  current 
measurement to determine the residual beam motion to 
be  corrected.  The  beam  transport  from  the  adjacent 
upstream feedback loop was calculated adaptively from 
the natural beam jitter. 

In the presence of wakefields, the beam transport is 
non-linear  and  depends  on  the  location  where  the 
perturbation  occurs  and  distance  it  propagates.  This 
means  that  the  simple  SLC  single-cascade  system  is 
inadequate.  In  the  NLC  multi-cascade  scheme,  each 
feedback receives information from all of the upstream 
loops.  The  beam  transport  is  an  overconstrained  least 
squares  fit  matrix,  which  converts  many  upstream 
states to the fitted downstream location. 

The NLC simulations were done with five feedback 
systems distributed along the linac. Figure 1 shows the 
response of the last of these loops to a step disturbance 
early in the linac. The raw state is the measured beam 
orbit  in  the  linac  which  can  be  fixed  perfectly  in 
simulation, when accelerator or modeling imperfections 
are not included. This simulation simply shows that the 
multi-cascade  algorithm  is  correct.  The  response  seen 
on the BPMs of the last feedback loop is identical to the 
design response for a single feedback loop, even though 
five loops  respond.  The  cascade-adjusted  state is the

Intuitively one might expect that the downstream loops 
would have nothing to do. However with the non-linear 
beam  transport,  the  downstream  feedbacks must make 
small corrections to achieve optimal system response. 

3  DEVICE CONFIGURATION STUDIES 
Another topic of study is the optimal number, type and 
placement  of  feedback  devices  for  the  NLC  linac.  In 
the  SLC,  the  BPMs  and  correction  dipoles  were 
grouped  together  over  a  distance  of  at  most  200  m 
because of bandwidth and connectivity constraints. The 
present NLC configuration includes 5 feedback systems 
distributed along the linac. Each feedback has 2 sets of 
4  dipole  correctors  (two  vertical  and  two  horizontal). 
The  first  set  of  correctors  is  at  the  beginning  of  the 
section and the second set is located midway to the next 
feedback. Four sets of BPM measurements are used per 
loop,  with  4  monitors  in  each  set.  Figures  2,  3  and  4 
show the response to a step disturbance in the middle of 
the first loop with this configuration.

Figure  2:  BPM  orbit  along  the  linac  after  feedback 
responds to a step function. The feedback correctors are 
located  at  the  position  of  the  vertical  lines  and  the 
BPMs are marked with (+). 

When a bunch passes off-axis through the accelerating 
structures,  the  wakefields  from  the  head  of  the  bunch 
deflect the particles which follow causing a "tilt" or y-z 
correlation  along  the  bunch.  Local  feedback  corrects 
the  bunch  centroid  but  does  not  remove  the  tilt.  The 
additional  sets  of  BPMs  and  correctors  help  find  a 
solution which minimizes both centroid offset and tilt. 
Figure 4 shows the offset of individual slices along the 
length of the bunch for the same simulation. The beam 
profile remains fairly flat for this device configuration.

Most  of  the  simulations  have  been  done  using  dipole 
magnets  as  the  correction  devices.  Other  devices  such 
as  crab  cavities  or  structure  movers  have  also  been 
studied to determine if they better correct the distortion 
of  the  bunches  and  the  emittance  dilution.  Figure  5 
shows  the  response  to  a  perturbation  for  a  system  in 
which  structure  movers  are  used  for  one  set  of 
correctors  in  each  feedback.  The  effectiveness  of 
various alternatives is still under study.

4  GROUND MOTION STUDIES 

The  critical  test  for  a feedback system is performance 
in  the  presence  of  ground  motion  and  accelerator 
errors. Simulations have been done using both the ATL 
ground  motion  model  of  Shiltsev  [6]  and  the  more 
complete model developed by Seryi [7]. Initial studies 
evaluated  the  RMS  beam  jitter  and  emittance  growth 
after  several  seconds  of  ground  motion  changes,  with 
feedback at 120 Hz rate. 

The ATL ground motion model was used to compare 
the  performance  of  different  feedback  configurations. 
The  simulations  used  30  minutes  of  ATL-like  ground 
motion with a coefficient of 5.0e-7 µm2/m/sec, a typical 
value for the SLAC site. The BPM resolution was 0.1 
µm and results from 100 random seeds were averaged. 
For  the  proposed  NLC  configuration,  the  emittance 
growth  was  less  than  6%.  Table  1  lists  the  results 
showing  significantly  larger  emittance  growth  if  less 
correctors or BPMs are used.

device configurations. Additional correctors and BPMs 
are effective in reducing emittance dilution.   

Figure  6  shows  how  the  emittance  grows  along  the 
linac  with  the  NLC  feedback  configuration.  The 
emittance  increases  at  the  location  of  the  corrector 
dipoles which create dispersion. However, the resulting 
emittance  growth  is  only  5.7%  compared  with  104% 
without feedback, as shown in figure 7.

5  FUTURE PLANS 

Further studies are needed to optimize the performance 
of the NLC feedback systems in the presence of ground 
motion  and  other  errors.  Integrated  simulations  with 
feedback,  ground  motion,  cultural  noise,  and  beam-
based  alignment  algorithms  are  planned.  These  more 
complete  simulations  will  be  used  to  estimate  the 
operational  control  requirements  for  the  NLC  and  the 
beam  jitter  and  emittance  dilution  expected  during 
operation.  

Another  topic  of  study  is  the  feasibility  of  adaptive 
or  semi-invasive  methods  for  measuring  and  updating 
the  feedback  model  of  beam  transport  in  the  linac. 
Because  the  planned  feedback  systems  are  distributed 
over  large  distances,  accumulated  energy  or  focusing 
errors can cause the actual model to differ significantly 
from the theoretical model. Present simulations assume 
that the model is updated by calibration measurements 
but adaptive methods would perform better.

ABSTRACT 

 

The  nonlinear  development  of  finite  amplitude  disturbances  in  mixed  convection 

flow in a heated vertical annulus is studied by direct numerical simulation.  The unsteady 

Navier  Stokes  equations  are  solved  numerically  by  a  spectral  method  for  different  initial 

conditions.    The  results  indicate  that  the  equilibrium  state  of  the  flow  is  not  unique,  but 

depends  on  the  amplitude  and  wavenumber  of  the  initial  disturbance.    In  all  cases,  the 
equilibrium  state  consists  of  a  single  dominant  mode  with  the  wavenumber  kf,  and  its 
superharmonics.  The range of equilibrium wavenumbers kf was found to be narrower than 
the  span  of  the  neutral  curve  from  linear  theory.    Flows  with  wavenumbers  outside  this 

range, but within the unstable region of linear theory are found to be unstable and to decay, 

but  to  excite  another  wave  inside  the  narrow  band.    This  result  is  in  agreement  with  the 

Eckhaus and Benjamin-Feir sideband instability.  The results also show that linearly stable 

long  and  short  waves  can  also  excite  a  wave  inside  this  narrow  band  through  nonlinear 
wave interaction.  The results suggest that the selection of the equilibrium wavenumber kf 
is due to a nonlinear energy transfer process which is sensitive to initial conditions. 

 

The  consequence  of  the  existence  of  nonunique  equilibrium  states  is  that  the 

Nusselt  number  cannot  always  be  expressed  uniquely  as  a  function  of  appropriate 
dimensionless  parameters  such  as  the  Reynolds,  Prandtl  and  Rayleigh  numbers.    Any 
physical quantity transported by the fluid, such as heat and salt, can at best be determined 
within the limit of uncertainty associated with nonuniqueness.  This uncertainty should be 
taken  into  account  when  using  any  accurately  measured  values  of  the  heat  transfer  rate 
since  it  is  only  one  of  the  many  possible  states  for  the  controllable  conditions  and 
geometry.    Extrapolating  this  fact  to turbulence, it  is our opinion, since the time average 
will  depend  on  the  initial  condition,  it  will  not  equal  to  the  ensemble  average  even  for 
stationary  turbulence.    This  is  because  that  the  mean  flow  is  not  unique  for  a  given 

Reynolds or Rayleigh number.  Consequently, the ergodic hypothesis is not valid.  From 

an application point of view, only time average has physical significance.

INTRODUCTION 

 

The study of nonisothermal flows in heated ducts is of fundamental importance in 

engineering  applications,  and  has  been  the  subject  of  many  experimental  and  theoretical 

investigations.    The  final  outcome  of  most  of  these  investigations  is  a  prediction  of  the 

Nusselt  number  for  different  geometries  and  heating  conditions.    The  Buckingham  pi 

Theorem implies that the Nusselt number may be expressed deterministically as a function 

of  appropriate  dimensionless  control  parameters  such  as  the  Reynolds,  Rayleigh  and 

Prandtl numbers.  Thus, the results of experiments conducted using geometrically similar 

small-scale  prototype  models  can  be  used  to  predict  the  heat-transfer  rates  in  real 

engineering situations.  This paper demonstrates that the Nusselt number cannot always be 

determined  uniquely  even  if  the  control  parameters  are  fixed  uniquely  and  the  flow  has 

reached an equilibrium state, due to the possible existence of multiple equilibrium states.  

The  implication  of  the  existence  of  nonunique  equilibrium  states  is  that  any  physical 

quantity transported by the fluid, such as heat and salt, can at best be determined within the 

limit of uncertainty associated with nonuniqueness.  This uncertainty can occur even in the 

laminar flow regime after its first bifurcation point. 

 

Mixed convection flow in a heated vertical annulus is used as a model problem to 

illustrate this  uncertainty  principle.   It  is  common  practice  to  treat  such  flows as parallel 

flows.  The parallel flow assumption simplifies the analysis considerably, and the velocity 

and  temperature  fields  can  be  easily  predicted  as  functions  of  the  transverse  coordinate.  

However, recent work has shown that fully developed mixed convection flows in vertical 

ducts  are  highly  unstable  due  to  thermally-induced  instabilities  [1-4].    The  presence  of 

instabilities  in  nonisothermal  flows  in  heated  vertical  pipes  has  been  observed 

experimentally  by  Hanratty,  Rosen  &  Kabel  [5],  Kemeny  &  Somers  [6]  and  Scheele  & 

Hanratty  [7].    These  instabilities  lead  to  significant  increases  in  the  heat  transfer  rates 

above those predicted by parallel flow models.  When the flow is stably stratified, with the 

buoyancy forces aiding the fluid motion, they observed that the initial transition resulted in 

4 

a new equilibrium non-parallel flow.  However, when the flow is unstably stratified, with 

the buoyancy forces opposing the fluid motion, the transition to turbulence can be abrupt.  

Thus, the bifurcation is supercritical when buoyancy forces aid the fluid motion, and may 

be subcritical when the buoyancy forces oppose the fluid motion.  Similar instabilities have 

been  observed  by  Maitra  &  Subba  Raju  [8]  for  flow  in  a  heated  vertical  annulus.    They 

also found that the instabilities resulted in heat transfer rates which were much higher than 

those predicted by a parallel-flow model.  The evolution of finite-amplitude disturbances 

in this flow situation was studied theoretically by using weakly nonlinear instability theory 

[9].  The results indicate that the bifurcation is supercritical when buoyancy forces aid the 

fluid motion and are in agreement with the experiments of Maitra & Subba Raju. 

 

In  this  investigation,  the  nonlinear  development  of  disturbances  in  mixed 

convection  flow  in  a  heated  vertical  annulus  is  simulated  numerically  by  solving  the 

Navier-Stokes  equations  using  a  spectral  method.    The  time-dependent  Navier-Stokes 

system  is  solved  starting  with  different  initial  conditions.    The  results  show  that  the 

equilibrium state depends on the amplitude and shape of the initial disturbance, and is not 

unique.    In  all  cases,  the  final  equilibrium  state  is  a  monochromatic  traveling  wave 

consisting of a single dominant mode with a wavenumber kf , together with its harmonics, 

and  an  induced  mean  flow  distortion.    The  range  of  equilibrium  wavenumbers  kf  was 

found  to  be  a  subset  of  the  linearly  unstable  band  of  wavenumbers.    Flows  with 

wavenumbers  outside  this  subset  but  within  the  linearly  unstable  band  of  wavenumbers 

were  found  to  be  unstable  and  to  decay,  the  energy  being  transferred  to  a  mode  with 

wavenumber inside this subset, which is excited through nonlinear interaction.  This result 

is in agreement with the Eckhaus and Benjamin-Feir sideband instability [10].  Numerical 

simulations  starting  with  initial  conditions  consisting  of  a  single  dominant  mode  with 

wavenumbers lying in the linearly stable range also resulted in an equilibrium state with a 

final dominant wavenumber kf inside this subset.  Similar results were obtained for Taylor-

Couette  flow  by  Yao  &  Ghosh  Moulic  [11],  using  a  weakly  nonlinear  analysis  with  a 

5 

continuous spectrum.  They represented the disturbance by a Fourier integral, and derived 

an integro-differential Landau equation for the amplitude density of the wave-components 

of a continuous spectrum of waves.  Numerical integration of this Landau equation showed 

that the final equilibrium state was not unique, but depended on the waveform of the initial 

disturbance  and  the  initial  wave  amplitudes,  as  observed  experimentally  [12-14].    These 

results  suggest  that  the  selection  of  the  equilibrium  wave-number  is  due  to  a  nonlinear 

energy transfer process, which is sensitive to initial conditions. 

 

The  consequence  of  the  existence  of  nonunique  equilibrium  states  is  that  the 

Nusselt  number  cannot  always  be  uniquely  determined  as  a  function  of  appropriate 

dimensionless control parameters such as the Reynolds, Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers, as 

implied by the Buckingham pi theorem.  Any physical quantity such as heat, species etc. 

transported by the fluid can at best be determined within the limit of uncertainty associated 

with nonuniqueness.  This uncertainty can not be ignored in practice. 

 

The numerical results obtained in this investigation indicate that nonlinear effects 

induce a large distortion of the mean flow.  The kinetic energy of the distorted mean flow 

is found to be the dominant component of the disturbance kinetic energy, and much higher 

than the kinetic energy of the fundamental dominant wave in the equilibrium state.  This 

implies that classical  weakly  nonlinear  theories of monochromatic waves [15,16] as well 

as  slowly-varying  wave  packets  [17-19]  which  assume  a  priori  that  the  mean  flow 

distortion  is  induced  by  the  fundamental  wave  and is a much  smaller order effect,  is  not 

valid.    This  is  because  the  classical  theories  are  for  monochromatic  waves,  and  do  not 

consider  the  nonlinear  energy  transfer  among  different  waves.    This  drawback  can  be 

overcome by reformulating the problem with a continuous spectrum [20].  The analysis in 

[20] is an extension of the weakly nonlinear theory of a continuous spectrum of stationary 

waves [11] to traveling waves.  The disturbance is represented by a Fourier integral over 

all possible wavenumbers.  The Fourier components are expanded in a series of the linear 

stability  eigenfunctions. 

  The  eigenfunction  expansion  reduces  the  Navier-Stokes 

6 

equations  to  a  set  of  nonlinearly  coupled  integrodifferential  equations  for  the  amplitude 

density  function  of  a  continuous  spectrum  without  any  approximation.    The  equations 

describing  the  evolution  of  monochromatic  waves  and  slowly  varying  wavepackets  of 

classical  weakly  nonlinear  theories  are  special  limiting  cases  of  the  integrodifferential 

equations  in  a  parameter  range  close  to  the  onset  of  linear  instability  with  a  single 

eigenmode for the  waves.   Comparison with the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes 

equations,  however,  indicates  that  the  range  of  validity  of  the  classical  weakly  nonlinear 

theories  is  very  small.    There  are  cases  where  the  classical  theories  predict  qualitatively 

incorrect results.  The solution of the integrodifferential equations with 20 eigenmodes, on 

the  other  hand,  agrees  with  the  results  of  the  direct  numerical  simulation  of  the  Navier-

Stokes equations presented in this paper.  This is because the integrodifferential equations 

are equivalent to the Navier-Stokes equations.  Thus, the solution of the integrodifferential 

equations is an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations.  The CPU time required for 

the  solution  of  the  integrodifferential  equations  is  only  one-fourth  of  the  CPU  time 

required  for  the  direct  simulation  of  the  Navier-Stokes  equations  using  a  Fourier-

Chebyshev spectral method in this paper, but requires more computer memory.

ANALYSIS  

We consider the flow in a heated vertical annulus, driven by an externally applied 

pressure  gradient,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  1.    A  constant  vertical  temperature  gradient  is 

maintained at the inner cylinder, and the outer cylinder is insulated.  Let (r, φ , z) denote 

cylindrical  polar  coordinates,  with  the  z-axis  aligned  with  the  common  axis  of  the 

cylinders, and let (u, v, w) denote the corresponding velocity components.  The equations 

describing  the  flow  are  the  continuity,  Navier-Stokes  and  energy  equations.    Using  the 

Boussinesq approximation, these equations may be written in dimensionless form as

All lengths have been scaled by the distance between the cylinders, d = r2 - r1, where r1 is 

the radius of the inner cylinder and r2 is the radius of the outer cylinder.  Our choice of the 

velocity scale is based on the applied pressure gradient, G.  For isothermal flow through an 

annulus, the average axial velocity is W = G d2 / (Cρν ), where, 

η = r1  /  r2  is  the  radius  ratio  of  the  annulus,  ρ  is  the  density  of  the  fluid,  and  ν  is  the 

kinematic  viscosity.    This  provides  a  natural  velocity  scale  for  this  problem.    A 

nondimensional pressure is defined by  

where  p   is  the  (dimensional)  pressure  fluctuation.    The  time  is  scaled  by  d/W.    The 

temperature  of  the  inner  cylinder  increases  linearly  with  the  axial  coordinate  from  an 

upstream reference temperature, To, as Tw = To + µ d z, where µ is the constant vertical 

temperature  gradient.    In  the  limiting  case  of  a  fully  developed  flow,  this  simulates  a 

uniform  heat  flux  thermal  boundary  condition  on  the  inner  cylinder.    A  dimensionless

The  stability  of  this  parallel-flow  may  be  studied  by  superposing  a  disturbance  on  this 

flow.    The  finite-amplitude  evolution  of  such  disturbances  has  been  studied  by  Yao  & 

Rogers [9] using a perturbation method.  In this study, we solve the system of equation (1) 

as an initial value problem using a spectral method.  The spatial discretization is based on

This choice of collocation points yields 'spectral accuracy' and allows fast transformation 

between  physical  space  and  wave  space.    Time-differencing  was  done  using  a  Crank-

Nicholson  scheme  for  the  diffusion  terms  and  second-order  Adams-Bashforth  for  the 

convection  and  body  force  terms.    The  rotation  form  of  the  Navier-Stokes  equations  is 

preferred  for  the  numerical  simulations  because,  as  noted  by  Orszag[21],  the  use  of  this 

form guarantees that Fourier collocation methods conserve kinetic energy and ensures that 

the  nonlinear  terms  do  not  cause  numerical  instability.    Time-differencing  errors  are 

10 

reduced  by  using    coordinate  system  moving  with  the  (approximate)  phase  speed  of  the 

fundamental  wave,  although,  because  of  Galilean  invariance,  this  is  equivalent  to  a 

calculation  in  a  frame  of  reference  which  is  at  rest.    The  momentum  equations  are 

decoupled by solving a Poisson equation for the pressure.  The correct boundary conditions 

for the pressure, consistent with a divergence-free velocity field at the solid boundaries, are 

obtained by an influence matrix technique [22,23].  The numerical procedure requires the 

solution  of  a  sequence  of  Helmholtz  equations  at  each  time  step.    These  equations  are 

solved by a preconditioned minimum residual method [24].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Results have been obtained for an annulus with a radius ratio η = 0.375, Re = 1000, 

Ra=200  and  Pr  =  6.    The  radius  ratio  of  0.375  was  chosen  so  that  the  results  could  be 

compared with the experiments of Maitra & Subba Raju [8].  The critical Rayleigh number 

at  the  onset  of  instability  for  this  flow  configuration  is  Ra c   =  89  [9].    Linear  stability 

analysis indicates that at Ra=200, Re = 1000 and Pr = 6, the parallel basic flow is unstable 

to  disturbances  with  wavenumbers  lying  between  0.23  and  1.13.    The  time-dependent 

Navier  Stokes  system  (1)  was  solved  numerically  for  different  initial  conditions.    The 

initial conditions used for the computations were of the form

wavenumber  k  =  n α, and  An  is  the  initial  disturbance  amplitude  for  the  mode  with 

wavenumber k = nα.  The computations were done on the CRAY C-90 supercomputer at 

the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.  In order to minimize the computer time, most of 

the computations were done for the axisymmetric case, using α = 0.25 and Nz = 36.  Some 

of  the  computations  have  been  done  on  a  finer  grid  using  α  =  0.1  and  Nz  =  96.    The 

asymmetric azimuthal modes are linearly stable at the parameters used in this study, and 

although  they  can  be  excited  through  nonlinear  interactions,  we  do  not  expect  this  to 

happen at Ra = 200.  The validity of this assumption has been checked for one of the cases 

by  solving  the  three-dimensional  Navier-Stokes  system,  using  8  Fourier  modes  in  the 

azimuthal  direction.    The  asymmetric  azimuthal  modes  were  not  excited  in  this 

computation,  that  is,  the  flow  remained  axisymmetric.    Adequate  spatial  resolution  was 

ensured  by  monitoring  the  kinetic  energies  of  the  highest  Fourier  modes.    For 

axisymmetric flow, the kinetic energy of the kth Fourier mode is given by  

for k≠ 0, and

Aliasing errors resulting from severe truncation in the number of Fourier modes can result 

in an artificial curl in the high-wavenumber end of the energy spectrum.  This was found to 

occur  in  our  computations,  and  is  illustrated  in  Figure  2  which  shows  the  spectrum  of 

kinetic  energy  at  time  t = 800,  for  a  numerical  simulation  using  α = 0.25  in  which  the 

mode k = 0.75 was given an initial amplitude of 0.005 at time t = 0, and the other modes 

were given small initial amplitudes of 10-10.  The spectrum for the aliased calculation curls 

upwards  at  the  high  wavenumber  end.    In  order  to  get  accurate  results,  we  eliminate  the 

aliasing  errors  by  padding,  using  the  two-third  rule  [24].    The  results  of  the  de-aliased 

calculation at t = 800, starting with the same initial conditions is also shown in Figure 2.  

The spectra in this case did not exhibit the artificial curl at the high wave-number end.  It is 

worthwhile to note that in the de-aliased calculation, the energies in the modes k=0.25, 0.5, 

1,  1.25  etc.  which  are  not  integral  multiples  of  the  fundamental  mode  k=0.75,  was 

negligible.  In the aliased calculation, on the other hand, all these modes were excited due 

to the aliasing error.  This indicates that in this problem, aliasing errors can cause serious 

problems, and need to be eliminated.  

 

Figure  3(a)  shows  the  evolution  of  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  dominant  wave 

components  for  a  numerical  simulation  with  α = 0.25 in  which  the  mode  k  = 0.75 was 

given  an  initial  amplitude  of  0.005,  and  the  other  modes  were  given  small  initial 

amplitudes  of  10−10.    The  mode  k  =  0.75  is  linearly  unstable,  and  grows  by  obtaining 

energy from the mean flow.  Nonlinear interactions generate the harmonics k = 1.5, 2.25 

and 3, and induce a mean flow distortion (k = 0).  As the amplitude of the mode k = 0.75 

increases,  nonlinear  effects  become  more  important,  and  alter  the  linear  growth  rate, 

causing  the  mode  to  decay  and  eventually  reach  an  equilibrium  state.    The  equilibrium 

state is a monochromatic traveling wave in which the fundamental mode k = 0.75 remains 

13 

the  dominant  mode,  while  its  superharmonics,  generated  through  nonlinear  interaction, 

have smaller amplitudes.  The kinetic energy of the third and fourth harmonics ( k = 2.25 

and k = 3 ) are much smaller than the energies of the fundamental mode k = 0.75, and the 

second  harmonic  k  =  1.5;  these  modes  have  not  been  plotted  in  Figure  3(a).    It  is  worth 

noting that the kinetic energy associated with the mean flow distortion is higher than the 

kinetic  energy  of  the  fundamental  mode  k  =  0.75.    This  implies  that  classical  weakly 

nonlinear  theories  which  assume  a  priori  that  the  order  of  magnitude  of  the  mean  flow 

distortion is smaller than that of the fundamental wave, is not valid for this problem.  In 

order to check the accuracy of the numerical result, the calculation was repeated using a 

finer grid with α = 0.05, and 8 Fourier modes in the azimuthal direction.  This computation 

required a lot of computer time, and was carried out only to a final time t = 500.  The result 

of the computation using the fine grid is superimposed on Figure 3(a).  The difference in 

the two computations can hardly be noticed in the scale of Figure 3(a).  This indicates that 

the  coarse  grid  has  adequate  resolution.    It  is  worth  pointing  out  that  the  energies  in  the 

Fourier  modes  which  were  not  integral  multiples  of  0.75  were  negligible,  that  is  these 

modes  were  not  excited.    Hence,  a  computation  which  does  not  include  these  modes 

produces the same result as a computation which includes all these modes. 

Figure 3(b) shows the results of a numerical simulation with α = 0.25 in which the 

mode k = 0.5 was given an initial amplitude of 10-2 and the other modes were given initial 

amplitudes  of  10-10.    The  equilibrium  state  in  this  case  is  a  monochromatic  wave  with  a 

dominant mode k = 0.5, and its small-amplitude super-harmonics. 

Figure 3(c) shows the results of a numerical simulation with α = 0.25, starting with 

a single dominant mode with wavenumber k = 0.25 at time t = 0.  The mode k = 0.25 is 

linearly  unstable,  and  the  weakly  nonlinear  theory  of  monochromatic  waves  [15,16] 

predicts  a  supercritical  equilibrium  state  for  this  mode.    However,  as  indicated  in  Figure 

3(c), the mode k = 0.25 grows initially and then decays to zero, while its harmonic k = 0.5, 

excited  through  nonlinear  interaction,  grows  and  reaches  a  finite-amplitude  supercritical 

 

 

14 

equilibrium  state.    This  indicates  that  the  equilibrium  state  predicted  by  the  weakly 

nonlinear theory of monochromatic waves for the mode k = 0.25 is unstable.  This result is 

in agreement with the Eckhaus and Benjamin-Feir side-band instability. 

 

The results of a numerical simulation with α =  0.25, is which the mode k = 1 was 

given  an  initial  amplitude  of  0.005,  and  the  other  modes  were  given  small  initial 

amplitudes of 10-6, is shown in Figure 3(d).  The mode k = 1 is linearly unstable and grows 

initially according to linear theory, as nonlinear effects are initially small.  As its amplitude 

increases,  nonlinear  effects  become  important,  and  cause  it  to  decay.    The  subharmonic 

mode k = 0.5, excited by nonlinear interaction grows and reaches an equilibrium amplitude 

which  is  higher  than  that  of  the  mode  k=1.    The  mode  k  =  1  remains  in  the  final 

equilibrium state, but is not the dominant mode.  This result agrees with the Eckhaus and 

Benjamin-Feir sideband instability.  It is worth noting that subharmonic transitions such as 

this may play an important role in the transition to turbulence at higher Rayleigh numbers. 

 

Figure 3(e) shows the results of a numerical simulation with α =  0.1, in which the 

mode  k  =  0.2  was  given  an  initial  amplitude  of  0.005,  and  the  other  modes  were  given 

small initial amplitudes of 10-6.  The mode k = 0.2 is linearly stable and decays to zero, as 

it transfers energy to the mean flow.  However, nonlinear effects excite the mode k = 0.4, 

which grows and finally becomes the dominant wave in the equilibrium state.  This result 

suggests  that  nonlinear  wave  interaction  may  be  a  credible  wavelength  adjustment 

mechanism  for  boundary-layer  receptivity,  which  may  serve  to  explain  how  a  short 

Tollmien Schlichting wave in a boundary layer is excited by long-wavelength free-stream 

noise [25]. 

 

Figure 3(f) shows the results of a numerical simulation with α = 0.25, starting with 

a  single  dominant  mode  k  =  1.25,  which  was  given  an  initial  amplitude  of  0.005.    The 

mode  k  =  1.25  is  linearly  stable  and  decays  to  zero.    However,  nonlinear  interactions 

transfer  energy  to  subharmonic  modes,  exciting  the  mode  k  =  0.5,  which  grows  and 

reaches  an  equilibrium  state.    The  results  shown  in  Figures  3(e)  and  3(f)  indicate  that 

15 

linearly  stable  long  and  short  waves  can  play  an  important  role  in  the  transition  process 

from  laminar  to  turbulent  flow,  although  they  may  eventually  decay  to  zero,  by 

transferring energy to other modes through nonlinear wave-interaction. 

 

Figure  3(g)  shows  the  dominant  waves  which  evolve  in  a  numerical  simulation 

with α=0.25, starting with a uniform broad-band spectrum with initial amplitude 0.001 at 

time  t=0.    The  dominant  wave  in  the  equilibrium  state  in  this  case  is  the  mode  k  =  0.5, 

which  is  the  wavenumber  closest  to  the  minimum  critical  wavenumber  at  the  onset  of 

instability.    Numerical  simulations  starting  with  a  uniform  initial  amplitude  of  10-6  also 

resulted in the same equilibrium state. 

The selection of the equilibrium wavenumber is due to nonlinear wave interactions.  

The  numerical  results  suggest  the  selection  principles  are  similar  to  Taylor-Couette 

flows[11]: 

1)    When  the  initial  disturbance  consists  of  a  single  dominant  wave  within  the 

unstable  region,  the  initial  wave  remains  dominant  in  the  final  equilibrium  state.  

Consequently, for a slowly accelerating cylinder, the critical wave is likely to be dominant. 

2)  When  the  initial  condition  consists  of  two  waves  with  finite  amplitudes  in  the 

unstable region, the final dominant wave is the one with the higher initial amplitude.  If the 

two waves have the same initial finite amplitude, the dominant wave seems to be the one 

closer to the critical wave.  On the other hand, if the initial amplitudes are very small, the 

faster growing wave becomes dominant.     

 

3)  When  the  initial  disturbance  is  a  uniform  broad-band  spectrum,  the  final 

dominant wave is the fastest linearly growing wave, if the initial amplitude is small.  On 

the  other  hand,  if  the  uniform  noise  level  is  not  small,  the  critical  wave  is  the  dominant 

equilibrium one.

equilibrium  values  of  the  Nusselt  number  is  shown  in  Table  1  for  different  equilibrium 

states.  The increase in the Nusselt number due to the flow bifurcation, relative to its basic 

state  value,  is  also  shown  in  Table  1.  As  the  table  indicates,  the  increase  in  the  Nusselt 

number  varies  from  8.5%  for  an  equilibrium  wavenumber  of  0.4  to  12.1%  for  an 

equilibrium wavenumber of 0.75.  The Nusselt number is plotted in Figure 4 as a function 

of  the  Rayleigh  number.    The  results  obtained  by  Yao  &  Rogers  [9],  using  the  weakly 

nonlinear  theory  of  monochromatic  waves  is  shown  in  Figure  4,  and  compared  with  the 

experimental  data  of  Maitra  &  Subba  Raju  [8].  The variation in the Nusselt number for 

different  equilibrium  states  predicted  by  the  direct  numerical  simulations  in  the  current 

investigation  is  indicated  by  the  vertical  line  at  Ra  =  200.    The  numerical  value  of  the 

uncertainty in the Nusselt number is small for the present case.  However, the underlying 

principle  has  far  reaching  consequences.    It  is  worth  pointing  out  that  in  the  current 

problem,  the  linearly  unstable  range  of  wavenumbers  at  Ra = 200  is  small.    As  Ra 

increases,  the  linearly  unstable  range  will  increase  accordingly.    Also,  many  problems 

where  the  linearly  unstable  span  of  the  neutral  curve  is  large  near  the  first  bifurcation 

point, such as mixed convection flows in a heated vertical pipe [26, 27], the uncertainty in 

the Nusselt number is likely to be much larger and may not be ignored in practice.  Since 

the  same  phenomenon  has  been  found  for  the  Taylor-Couette  flow  [11]  and  the  mixed 

convection  in  this  paper,  we  believe  that  the  uncertainty  phenomenon  is  generic  and  is 

applicable  to  all  fluid  flows,  isothermal  or  non-isothermal,  after  their  first  bifurcation 

points.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

 
The  current  investigation  demonstrates  that  the  supercritical  equilibrium  state  of 
traveling  waves  bifurcating  from  fully-developed  mixed-convection  flow  in  a  heated 
vertical  annulus  is  not  unique.    Numerical  simulations  of  the  time-dependent  Navier-
Stokes  equations  with  different  initial  conditions  show  that  the  final  equilibrium  state  of 
the flow depends on the waveform of the initial disturbance.  The results suggest that as 
the  flow  evolves  from  a  given  initial  state,  it  selects  an  equilibrium  wavenumber  from  a 
possible range of allowed wavenumbers.  The selection of the equilibrium wavenumber is 
governed  by  a  nonlinear  energy  transfer  process  which  is  sensitive  to  initial  conditions.  
The allowed range of equilibrium wavenumbers is a subset of the linearly unstable span of 
wavenumbers.  An important implication of the existence of non-unique equilibrium states 
is  that  the  Nusselt  number  can  be  determined  only  within  the  limit  of  uncertainty 
associated with nonuniqueness. 

 
It is suitable to speculate what the averaging process would be for turbulence since 
the  convection  has  multiple  solutions  in  a  continuous  range  of  spectra  after  the  first 
bifurcation  point.    Since  the  time  average  mean  flow  and  associated  turbulent  quantities 
depend  on  the  initial  conditions  and  are  not  unique,  their  values  are  not  equal  to  the 
ensemble averages even for stationary turbulence.  From an application point of view, only 
time  average  has  physical  significance.    The  ensemble  average  would  be  the  averaged 
value of the all possible time averages which can be measured independently.

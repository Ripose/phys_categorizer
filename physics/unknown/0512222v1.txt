ABSTRACT 

Electron-phonon  relaxation  in  size-quantized  systems  may  become  inhibited  when  the 

spacing of discrete electron energy levels exceeds the magnitude of the phonon frequency.  We 

show,  however,  that  nanoclusters  can  support  a  fast  nonradiative  relaxation  channel  which 

derives  from  their  distinctive  ability  to  undergo  Jahn-Teller  shape  deformations.    Such  a 

deformation  represents  a  collective  and  coherent  vibrational  excitation  and  enables  electronic 

transitions to occur without a multiphonon bottleneck.  We analyze this mechanism for a metal 

cluster  within  the  analytical  framework  of  a  three-dimensional  potential  well  undergoing  a 

spheroidal distortion.  An expression for the time evolution of the distortion parameter is derived, 

the electronic level crossing condition formulated, and the probability of electronic transition at a 

level  crossing  is  evaluated.    An  application  to  electron-hole  recombination  in  a  closed-shell 

aluminum cluster with 40 electrons shows that the short (~250 fs) excitation lifetime observed in 

recent pump-probe experiments can be explained by the proposed mechanism.

I. INTRODUCTION 

One of the central challenges in the physics of clusters and related nanoscale systems is 

the issue of the relaxation dynamics of excited states.  In particular, what are the specific decay 

channels  and  rates  of  single-particle  and  collective  electronic  excitations  in  size-quantized 

structures, and how do they evolve from the molecular limit of vibronic coupling to the electron-

phonon interaction characteristic of the bulk? 

The  so-called  “phonon  bottleneck”  problem1  is  noteworthy.    Consider  a  small  particle 

with electrons occupying a set of discrete energy levels, up to some highest occupied level |A〉 

(analogous to the “highest occupied molecular orbital,” or “HOMO,” in spectroscopic language).  

Suppose  an  electron  is  excited  into  the  next  higher  level,  |B〉  (analogous  to  the  “lowest 

unoccupied molecular orbital,” or “LUMO”); can it now undergo nonradiative relaxation?  In a 

conventional solid-state system, electron-hole recombination can be efficiently accomplished by 

phonon  emission.    But  in  a  cluster  the  gap  EB-EA  (the  “intershell  spacing,”  or  the  “HOMO-

LUMO gap”) can easily exceed the scale of vibrational energies by a very large factor.  Thus to 

bridge the gap an electron would need to emit a multitude of vibrational quanta simultaneously, a 

high-order process of exceedingly low probability. 

In this paper, we point out and analyze an efficient relaxation mechanism which is based 

on  the  fact  that  free  nanoclusters  possess  an  important  degree  of  freedom:  they  can  undergo 

significant shape deformations.  This feature distinguishes them from constrained nanostructures 

such  as  semiconductor  quantum  dots.    The  proposed  mechanism  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  1:    upon 

excitation, the cluster sets out on a Jahn-Teller distortion from its original spherical shape;  the 

energies  of  the  A  and  B  orbitals  shift  and  eventually  cross;  an  intershell  transition  occurs;  and 

 

2

finally the electron lands back in its original shell and the shape oscillation decays into a swarm 

of incoherent vibrations (heat).  An essential point to note is that this process is not subject to the 

phonon  bottleneck  issue:    shape  deformation  is  a  coherent  state,  i.e.,  a  coherent  multiphonon 

excitation without any additional smallness.  The process is analogous to internal conversion at 

an avoided crossing in polyatomic molecules,2 with the particularity that it involves a distinctly 

collective coordinate. 

The general treatment will be supplemented by a specific illustration referring to a recent 

time-resolved  two-photon  photoemission  experiment  on  free  Aln

¯  clusters  in  a  beam.3,4  

Aluminum  clusters  exhibit  electronic  shell  structure,5  and  Al13

¯  is  a  “magic”  cluster:    its  40 

valence electrons are accommodated in closed shells (1s, 1p, 1d, 2s, 1f, 2p), and a substantial gap 

separates  the  highest  occupied  level  (2p,  corresponding  to  the  label  A  above),  from  the  next, 

lowest unoccupied one (1g, corresponding to B).  In the experiment, a femtosecond laser pulse 

resonantly  excited  an  electron  from  A  into  B,6  and  a  subsequent  ionizing  pulse  probed  the 

population of the excited level after a certain delay.  A surprising observation was that the magic 

Al13

¯ cluster had a relaxation rate as fast as neighboring non-magic clusters (estimated at about 

250  fs),  despite  its  considerably  larger  excitation  gap.    This  implies  that  electron-electron 

scattering  is  not  the  central  factor,  and  indicates  “the  existence  of  a  very  effective  relaxation 

mechanism, which is independent on the electronic structure.”3   

So if there are no available intermediate electronic states in the gap, and radiative decay 

is known to occur on much longer time scales, a natural deduction is that the electron must relax 

via  strong  electron-phonon  coupling.    But  this  evokes  the  aforementioned  phonon  bottleneck 

issue: the excitation gap in Al13

¯ is 1.5 eV,3 while the phonon energy in Al is much smaller: ~40

meV.8    We  will  demonstrate  that  the  coherent  deformation  mechanism  can  explain  the 

experimentally observed time scale. 

Below, we treat the process step-by-step via an analytical model calculation for a finite 

square-well potential box filled with electrons, one of which is in an excited state..  Section II 

calculates the deformation-induced shift and crossing of the uppermost electronic levels, Section 

III  evaluates  the  time  needed  to  reach  the  level-crossing  point,  and  Section  IV  considers  the 

transition  probability  at  this  point.    Quadrupole  and  octupole  deformations  are  invoked  and 

analyzed. 

 

 

II. LEVEL SHIFTS AND CROSSINGS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF 

QUADRUPOLE SHAPE DEFORMATIONS 

As stated above, we model the cluster electrons as a Fermi gas confined to a spherically 

symmetric  square-well  potential.    This  is,  of  course,  only  an  approximation  to  more  accurate 

self-consistent  shell-model  potentials,  but  the  qualitative  character  of  the  low-lying  shells  in 

clusters and nuclei is not very sensitive to the well shape.9  The wave functions and energy levels 

of electrons in such a potential are given by

Wigner-Seitz  parameter,  a0  is  the  Bohr  radius,  Ne  is  the  number  of  valence  electrons  in  the 

cluster), and m* is the electron effective mass.10

This,  of  course,  shifts  the  electronic  energy  levels.    To  calculate  the  shift  for  a

contributes to the diagonal matrix element.  For quadrupole deformations (L=2) a calculation of 

Eq. (5) leads to the known result15,16

This specific expression has been derived for the square potential well model, but it will 

be qualitatively applicable to other shapes of the confining potential as well.  For example, for a 

harmonic oscillator potential the shell energy shift differs only by a factor of two.15 

From  Eqs.  (6),(7)  it  follows  that  to  first  order  in  the  deformation  parameter,  the  total 

energy of a filled shell doesn’t change: 

0

.  This reflects the fact that for a closed-

Eδ

nlm

=

∑

− ≤ ≤

shell  cluster  the  spherical  shape  represents  a  minimum-energy  configuration  (at  least  a  local 

minimum).    It  is  the  presence  of  incompletely  filled  shell  levels  that  drives  cluster  shape 

deformations. 

This is the case in our situation:  an electron promoted from the originally filled A shell 

into  the  originally  empty  B  shell.    The  cluster  will  begin  to  deform  until  the  A  sublevel 

containing the hole (call it |nA,lA,m〉) approaches the B sublevel (|nB,lB,m〉) containing the excited 

electron,  at  which  point  an  interlevel  transition  can  occur.    (Transitions  will  take  place  only 

between levels with the same value of m, hence both wave functions contain the same index.)  In 

other words, the critical deformation parameter α2,cr for level crossing is determined by setting

equal  to  the  shell  gap  (EB-EA).    The  negative  sign  of  the  second  term  arises  because  the  total 

energy  of  the  remaining  occupied  A  levels  decreases  by  the  same  amount  by  which  the  hole

energy increases (since the total energy of a filled shell must remain unchanged).  From Eq. (6), 

the result is

Consider  the  Al13

¯  cluster  example.    For  Al,  rs=2.1,  m*≈1.4me.8    For  a  cluster  of  40 

electrons,  R≈3.7Å.    The  relevant  roots  of  jl  are  (kn=2,l=1R)=7.73  and  (kn=1,l=4R)=8.18,  which 

translates into E1g≈1.12E2p, E2p≈11 eV, E1g-E2p≈1.3 eV.  The latter value is in sensible agreement 

with  the  experimental  gap  magnitude  of  1.5  eV.3    The  specific  sublevels  involved  in  the 

relaxation process can be identified from Eq. (6).  Quadrupole distortion will split the 2p level 

into two groups: m=0 will shift downwards, and m=±1 will shift upwards towards the 1g shell 

according to

.    Using  the  above  relation  between  E2p  and  E1g,  we  find  that  the 

relevant level crossing will occur at α2,cr≈0.15.  This value of the deformation parameter agrees 

to  within  ≈10%  with  that  found  from  the  Clemenger-Nilsson  diagram  of  electronic  levels  in 

spheroidal metal clusters.18  The diagram also illustrates that the linear approximation for δEnlm 

holds well for many subshells up to rather high values of the distortion parameter. 

Now  that  we  have  found  the  point  at  which  the  electron  and  hole  curves  cross  and 

recombination can occur, two more questions must be answered:  (1) how long after the electron 

excitation  event  (for  our  purposes,  instantaneous)  will  the  deformation  coordinate  reach  this 

 

7

value, and (2) what is the transition probability at the crossing point?  These questions are taken 

up in the following two sections. 

 

 

 

III. CLUSTER SHAPE OSCILLATIONS  

The  deformation  dynamics  of  the  confining  potential  well,  which  models  the  massive 

ionic core, may approximately be treated classically.  To determine the low energy cluster shape 

oscillation  spectrum,  we  therefore  need  to  include  a  term  describing  the  potential  energy  of 

volume-conserving  surface  deformations  of  an  elastic  spherical  crystallite  (for  example,  the 

clusters analyzed in the experiment [3] are expected to be below their melting point).  For cubic 

crystals, the elastic energy density is8,19

Here  α2  is  the  shape  deformation  parameter  introduced  in  the  previous  section.    (In  principle, 

deformation of a cluster ion also gives rise to Coulomb potential energy, but in the present case 

the Coulomb energy20 is negligible compared with the elastic energy.) 

Finally, the kinetic energy of the quadrupole surface oscillation is given by13

The first two terms are the kinetic and potential energies of deformation, Eqs. (11) and 

(12),  and  the  third  terms  is  the  concomitant  change  in  the  electronic  energy  (the  derivative  is 

evaluated  at  α2=0).    The  initial  conditions  for  our  situation  are  α2(t=0)=0,  α(cid:5) (t=0)=0:  at  the 

instant of electronic excitation, the cluster core has not yet started moving away from its original 

spherical shape.  This differential equation has the solution 

where the characteristic shape oscillation frequency is

Eq. (14) is one of the main results:  it describes the manner and the time scale of Jahn-

Teller deformation of cluster shapes.  It applies to liquid-drop clusters as well as to crystalline 

ones: in the former case the elastic energy term in Eq. (13) is replaced by a surface tension term, 

but the 

α  dependence remains the same.21

Considering  again  Al13

with the aluminum density and bulk moduli,8 and find for this cluster: Ω≈3×1013 s-1 and a≈0.2.  

Using Eq. (14), this means that the first approach to the level crossing point,

It remains to verify that the probability of an electronic transition at this point is not too 

 

 

 

IV. TRANSITION PROBABILITY AT THE CROSSING POINT 

The picture so far is as follows: after an electron is transferred into the lowest unoccupied 

orbital,  the  cluster  begins  to  undergo  a  quadrupole  deformation  according  to  Eq.(14),  and  the 

electron and hole energy levels approach each other at the point α2,cr.  Here the excited electron 

can  return  into  its  original  shell.    The  crossing  terms  are  also  commonly  referred  to  as  the 

“diabatic potential curves.”22  As the crossing point is passed at a certain speed v, the transition 

probability  w  for  a  single  passage  can  be  evaluated  by  the  Landau-Zener  formula23

.    Here  V  is  the  coupling  matrix  elements  of  the  two 

electronic wave functions at the crossing point, and F are the forces (i.e., the slopes of the two 

crossing curves, A and B in our notation) at the same point.   

 

10

For  some  cluster  sizes,  the  sublevels  of  interest  are  directly  coupled  by  the  spheroidal 

deformation  operator 

2

ˆ
H ′(cid:4)   [Eq.  (3)],  in  which  case  the  above  expression  for  w  can  be  applied 

immediately, with V of the form 

.  The exponent is likely to be rather large, and the 

ˆA H B′(cid:4)

2

transition probability near unity.  This means that it will be possible to associate the electronic 

relaxation time with the time needed to reach the crossing point, i.e., with the root of Eq. (18). 

However,  there  will  commonly  arise  situations  when  direct  coupling  is  absent.    For 

example,  in  the  example  of  photoexcited  Al13

¯  the  relevant  states  are  |A〉=|2p,m=±1〉  and 

|B〉=|1g,m=±1〉.    Since  their  angular  momentum  quantum  numbers  differ  by  Δl=3,  they  cannot 

interact  via 

2

ˆ
H ′(cid:4) .    (Indeed,  the  Clemenger-Nilsson  diagram18  shows  explicitly  that  there  is  no 

avoided crossing between these two terms when the cluster shape becomes spheroidal.24)   

In cases like this, the transition probability w should be evaluated based on the fact that 

some additional perturbation must be responsible for mixing the A and B states and facilitating 

electron  transfer  into  its  “home”  shell.    Interlevel  coupling  may  be  supplied,  for  example,  by 

weak admixtures of other orbital momentum character into the shell wave functions (cf. [6]) and 

by small-amplitude shape deformations with L>2.  Let us consider the latter scenario, focusing 

here on octupolar distortions. 

Axially symmetric octupolar deformations are described by the L=3 term in Eq. (2).  The 

transition probability is therefore calculated as

The denominator of Eq. (19) makes use of the fact that vF=∂E'nlm[α2(t)]/∂t, with the term

where the factor K contains all the cluster-specific matrix elements and factors in Eq. (19).  Its 

magnitude  can  be  quite  large  (e.g.,  for  the  Al13

¯  example,  it  evaluates  to  K≈2×104),  which  can 

make w substantial even for small α3 amplitudes, as shown below. 

The octupole shape deformations may be static, or caused by thermal oscillations.  To the 

best  of  our  knowledge,  static  axial  shapes  of  this  type  have  been  considered  only  for  alkali 

clusters,25-27  and  a  few  of  these  have  been  predicted  to  have  minimal  energies  for  finite,  and 

sometimes  even  sizeable,  values  of  α3.    Such  cases  imply  100%  transition  probabilities  at  the 

 

12

crossing  point.    However,  the  calculations  are  parameter-dependent,  and  their  generality  and 

applicability to other materials has not been accessed. 

On the other hand, thermal surface oscillations will always be present in warm clusters in 

a molecular beam.  It makes sense, therefore, to estimate the their contribution to the exponential 

in  Eq.  (20).    This  is  described  in  Appendix  B,  where  the  time  dependence  of  α3  and  its  time-

average value are estimated. 

Referring again to the case of the Al13

¯ experiment, the value appropriate for use in Eq. 

(20)  is 

α ≈2×10-4.    Combining  it  with  the  aforementioned  estimate  for  K,  we  once  again

obtain  a  transition  probability  close  to  unity.    Consequently,  it  is  reliable  to  conclude  that 

electron-hole  recombination  will  occur  within  one  or  two  level  crossings,  i.e.,  within  a  time 

range of between ~τ and ~(2πΩ-1-τ), as calculated at the end of Sec. III.  This translates into a 

range of ~100-200 fs.  In other words, within this time interval, the electron will transfer to the 

lower-shell  orbital  which  it  originally  vacated  as  a  result  of  absorbing  a  photon.    Given  the 

approximate  nature  of  the  calculation,  the  result  is,  in  fact,  quite  consistent  with  the 

experimental3,4 observation of a relaxation time of ~250 fs in the “magic” closed-shell Al13

¯. 

As a result of the electronic transition, the cluster now finds itself in the ground electronic 

state,  but  with  a  shape  deformed  away  from  the  equilibrium.    As  emphasized  earlier,  it  is 

essential  that  this  situation  represents  not  a  high-order  electron-phonon  scattering  process,  but 

the excitation of a coherent phonon state.  The collective distortion will then rapidly dephase into 

a  superposition  of  incoherent  vibrational  quanta  (i.e.,  heat).    This  is  an  interesting  dynamical 

problem in its own right, but it falls outside the scope of the present paper, since we have seen 

that the process of electronic relaxation may be considered complete at the level crossing point.

V. CONCLUSIONS 

Time-resolved spectroscopy on free metal clusters has presented a challenge:  how is it 

possible  for  an  excited  electron  to  exhibit  very  fast  relaxation across  a  shell  energy  gap  which 

significantly exceeds the vibrational frequencies of the particle?  How is the “phonon bottleneck” 

effect, familiar in nanostructure physics, bypassed in this situation?  We have demonstrated that 

there  exists  a  specific  fast  electronic  relaxation  mechanism  which  involves  not  a  slow 

multiphonon process, but a fast coherent vibrational excitation:  shape deformation of the cluster 

core.    The  availability  of  such  a  degree  of  freedom  represents  a  special  and  distinguishing 

property of free nanoclusters. 

As  an  application  of  the  theory,  the  case  of  the  closed-shell  Al13

¯  cluster  has  been 

considered.    The  calculated  transition  time  scale  provides  an  explanation  for  the  recent 

spectroscopic observation3,4 of surprisingly fast electron-hole recombination in this cluster.  

It should be pointed out that the mechanism and formalism discussed here are valid for 

open-shell (non-spherical) clusters as well.  Furthermore, they are applicable to other electronic 

excitation states and channels involving free clusters:  an electron can be injected into an excited 

energy level in a controlled manner not only by photoexcitation, but, for example, by resonant 

collisional transfer28-30 or by the capture of a slow electron.  It would be interesting to investigate 

the relaxation dynamics of such electrons under energy- and time-resolved conditions.

For shape deformations described by Eq. (2), the velocity of any point in the particle can

APPENDIX B:  AMPLITUDE OF OCTUPOLE OSCILLATIONS 

The amplitude of L=3 shape deformations can be evaluated in a manner analogous to that 

for quadrupolar oscillations in Sec. III.  For the kinetic and potential energies, one finds (see Ref.

ionic structure [7] find that the 2p shell of Al13

will be omitted from the relaxation time calculation, but it can provide the requisite initial population of 

the 1g shell when pumped by an intense laser pulse.

17 The specific population of the m levels of the B state by the excited electron are determined by the 

photoabsorption probabilities of the A orbitals from which the electron originates.  Since in Al13

¯ the 

latter have primarily p character,6 one-photon transitions ensure that a large fractions of the excited 

electrons will possess the requisite m=±1 character.  Electrons with other m values will relax somewhat 

slower, via an intermediate internal conversion step.  A more comprehensive analysis is beyond the 

scope of this work: the present aim is to establish the order of magnitude of the electronic relaxation 

time achievable by the coherent deformation mechanism.

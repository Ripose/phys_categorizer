ABSTRACT

A  model  to  describe  the  arising  of  new  structures  in  an  initial  homogeneous

biological system is proposed. The essay is motivated by the intention to work on

a non-equilibrium situation grouping together several mechanisms and processes

as: catalytic reactions on a surface, diffusion, stimulated migration and selective

heterogeneous  reaction.  A  model  for  morphogenesis  in  early  embryos  is

developed  on  two  basic  assumptions;  (i)  the  existence  of  an  electrified  surface

that defines  the  shape  (form)  of  the  growing  structure  and    (ii)  a  mechanism  to

select morphogens (ions or free radicals) from an initially homogeneous medium.

The  homogeneity  is  broke  when    an  electric  potential  arise  between  different

parcels of the system,  triggering a complex dynamic that drive the development

of  material  deposits  into  localized  regions  of  the  space.  The  evolution  of  the

deposits 

is  described  by  a  stochastic 

formalism  allowing 

for  analytical

expressions relating macroscopic.

INTRODUCTION

              Any  living  organism  need,  for  its  sustenance,  to  keep  up  an  open
interaction  with  the  environment.  This  interaction  could  refer  to  a  relation
between  the  entire  organism  and  the  external  world,  or  to  a  connection  among
internal  subsystems.  Any  way,  to  ensure  survival,  optimizing  chances,  a
regulatory flux mechanism has fundamental importance. The importance of mass
transport  processes  is  evident  in  sophisticated  organic  species  that  maintain  a
constant  functioning  to  select  composites,  from  the  physiological  solution.  This
selectiveness  in  high-organized  systems  is  related  to  a  flow  control  ability.  This
control  has  a  central  importance  during  early  embryos  development  when
reactions,  at  specific  locations,  must  occurs  during  specific  time  intervals.
However,  a  naive  description  of  ontogenesis  compels  to  consider  (i)  cellular
differentiation,  (ii)  the  increase  in  the  germ  mass  (biological  growth)  and  finally,
(iii)  morphogenesis  during  embryo’s  development.  This  reference  is  enough  to
point that a growth processes involves a few more things than just an adequate
description of the flow of matter. One of the basic questions is connected to the
onset  of  new  structures,  form  and  composition,  from  an  initially  homogeneous
medium.  How  to  get  a  liver  or  a  rib  from  the  same  physiological  solution?  The
diversity  emerging  from  a  single  background  emphasizes  that  nucleation  and
growth  of  new  structures  is  much  more  dependent  from  the  dynamics  that
generate the fluxes than properly by the flux itself. To conceive a mechanism to
compute the overall results in a system with competitive dynamics  is the goal of
those who try to describe any growth process.
             It has been remarked that in living organisms the physiological solutions
are mainly composed of high reactive ionic elements or organic radicals then, it is
natural to conceive matter transport inside biological cavities as a very complex
process,  guided  by  the  competition  of  many  mechanisms.  Nowadays  a  lot  of
inspiring  works  focus  attention  to  one  or  another  aspect  involved  in  this
complexity.  It  has  been  pointed  out  that  concentration  gradients  (Wolpert  1981;
Gierer  1981),  diffusion  (Crick  1970),  selective  chemical  reactions  (Babloyantz
1977)  and  ionic  currents  (Stern  1986  and  Jaffe  1981)  are  some  of  the  effects
invoked to maintain morphogen’s fluxes.
              In  spite  of  the  wonderful  analysis  found  in  the  literature  there  are  two
basic  problems  that  claim  for  adequate  statement  when  a  synthesis  of  the
subject is intended. First is (i) the allegation about the source of the instruction to
break  symmetry  in  order  to  displace  systems  from  equilibrium  states  with
homogeneous  mass  distribution.  A  necessary  condition 
to  promote
morphological  alterations.  Second,  there  is  a  technical  problem.  (ii)  To  work
complex systems in order to  get plain and  causal  laws  that explains  the  growth
processes.    Although  these  questions  demands  an  effort  we  are  still  unable  to
do,  it  is time for an endeavor  to  search a  scheme  where  different  mechanisms,
working  together,  generates  a  tractable  non  equilibrium  dynamic  that  describes
the  onset  of  new  structures  in  biological  systems.  The  articulation  of  these
mechanisms  in  just  one  simple  theory  still  lacks,  however  it  seems  that

3

electrochemical  transport  mechanism  could  be  an  adequate  proposition  to  be
explored. In fact through an electrochemical description we integrate generalized
forces like the concentration gradient and electric forces on a  description  of the
mass/charge  flow  near  catalytic  surfaces.  In  addition  it  is  well  known  that
electrochemical  processes  manifest  the  ability  to  induce  selective  migrations
through subtle changes on the electrode electric potential.
             In  this  paper  we  propose  a  model  to  examine  biological  systems  in
transient  process.  Our  intention  is  founded  on  a  stochastic  process  that  group
together:  catalytic  reactions  on  a  surface,  diffusion,  stimulated  migration  and
selective  heterogeneous.  The  model  offers  specific  predictions  about  the  ionic
currents  that  flow  through  membranes  such  its  results  can  be  compared  to
experimental verifications. Following Turing (1952), it is convenient to advise that
the model is a simplification and  an  idealization.  It  recognize  the  cell  theory  but
idealize  it  into  continuous  space  where  some  points  are  associated  with
particular  cells.  The  organic  material  is  also  continuously  distributed  inside  the
system that is visualized as an electrolytic cell, fulfilled by a physiological solution
composed by different chemical species diluted in water. Among the composites
a  particular  ionic  specie  (we  call  morphogen  from  now  on)  is  investigated.  This
"particle"  is  supposed  to  perform  a  free  Brownian  motion  into  the  bulk  of  the
solution. Closer to a singular plane of cells the morphogen becomes aware of a
field  which,    modify  its  chemical  nature  and  its  motion.  The  change  in
morphogen’s  dynamics  follows  a  particular  reaction  which  take  places  on  a
limited region of the space. After this change the morphogen perform no more a
free  Brownian  motion  but  a  stimulated  migration,  being  addressed  to  the
electrified plane to react on particular points. Through these points the "particles"
are  absorbed  by  the  cells  such  a  deposit  grows  by  the  successive  arose  of  an
specific type of particles. The cells, stuffed by the new material, are supposed to
be still alive, remaining with an integral semi-permeable membrane. That is, we
disregard the conception of a close packing material inside the cells. To illustrate
the approach we  think on the selective absorption of Calcium to originate a bony
structure. In this picture, Calcium ions play the role of a morphogen.
              On what follow we analyze the motion of just one morphogen, selected
among the others by the value assumed by  the  electrical  potential  difference  of
the cellular surface.  We consider the flux of ions through a collection of points on
a  plane  of  cells.  These  points  are  called  nucleation  points  in  analogy  to  early
electrochemical guiding studies (D’Ajello et al. 1999 and D’Ajello et al. submitted
to  publication).  They  indicates  the  loci  of  points,  on  through  which,  the
morphogens  are ingested by the cells.
In section II the model is defined and the procedures to achieve the mathematical
solutions  are  indicated.  In  section  III  two  particular  situations  are  analyzed,
namely;  (a)  one  in  which  diffusion  is  the  dominant  mechanism  to  define  the
dynamics  of  the morphogen  in  its flight  to  the  plane  and,  (b)  the  other  in  which
the  chemical  reaction  rate  of  the  morphogen,  on  the  cellular  surface,  is  the
slowest  process.  Some  results  are  sketched  and  discussed  in  the  fourth
paragraph. The conclusions are at the end.

II. 

THE THEORETICAL MODEL.

living  organisms  are 

              Biological 
the  prototype  of  non-equilibrium
thermodynamic  systems  and  the  existence  of  time  dependent  processes  in
heterogeneous  environment  is  its  preeminent  characteristics.  Notwithstanding,
biological  systems  are  well  regulated  in  every  one  of  their  parcels  to  the  point
that severe changes, occurring in short elapsed time, are frequently an evidence
of a disease or a high risk integrity process. So, to work with health situation, we
assume  that  our  system  is  too  short  compared  to  the  entire  organism  such  the
concentration gradients inside changes very little in distances less than 2000  m m
(a  distance  defined  by  some  200  cell).  That  mean,  we  choose  to  work  with  a
medium where a great number of particles are diluted in a physiological solution,
mainly  constituted  by  water  molecules.  The  assembly  particles  form  a  set  of
many  species  having  different  mass,  different  constitution  (they  could  be  single
ions  or  complex  molecules)  and  different  ionic  states.  Among  the  myriad  of
species, we focus attention in one particular kind of particles what is devised as
an hydrated/solvated ion showing a homogeneous distribution into the bulk of the
system.  To  simplify  we  call  this  singular  ion  a  morphogen.  The  morphogen
encapsulated by a shell of water molecules, due to polar attraction, moves inside
the  electrolytic  medium  performing  a  Brownian  motion.  This  complex
homogeneous  medium  undergo  a  symmetry  break  at  time,  t = 0 ,  when  an
electric  potential  difference  is  setting  up.  It  is  not  relevant,  at  this  moment,  to
discuss  the  mechanism  that  triggers  sustain  this  electric  potential  but  once  the
symmetry is broken, a biological surface is precisely conformed. Instead to work
with the entire surface we choose to consider a limited portion of it assuming that
every event in this sub-system occurs in a similar way as on the integral surface.
Thus we look to plane of cells, that works as an electrode in an electrochemical
cell. There is always a second electrode (the positive electrode), but far enough
from  our  system  such  it  is  natural  to  disregard.  On  the  electrode  (the  plane  of
cells), there are many electroactive points (we call them, nucleus, from now on).
Through  these  points  the  cellular  surface  perform  a  charge  exchange  with  the
morphogen. Some of these points are automatically activate at  t = 0 ; others turn
to  be  activated  during  the  course  of  time,  depending  on  the  physical  and
chemical  conditions  imposed  to  the  system.  In  Fig.  1a  we  show  a  schematic
representation  of  this  conception  where.  A  section  of  the  plane  is  visualized  at
two successive instant of time. In this transversal section of the plane  the  right-
hand  column  of  cells  correspond  to  topmost  shell  of  the  electrified  surface.  On
this  shell  are  located  the  nucleus  or  the  source  of  charges.  It  is  also  through
these  nucleus  that  morphogen  are  absorbed  by  the  surface  to  a  posterior
diffusion or sedimentation.
             We  are  advised  that  a  little  change  in  the  magnitude  of  the  electric
potential  (EP)  is  a  sufficient  conditions  to  select  another  kind  of  particle  to  be

5

attracted  in  order  to  overcome  a  reaction  on  the  catalytic  plane.  Thus  the
magnitude of the electric potential select the type of morphogen to be activate to
react  on  the  plane.  In  conclusion,    the  morphogen  is  one  specie  of  the  many
solvated  ions  inside  the  physiological  solution  and,  its  choice  is  dictate  by  the
magnitude of the EP.
              In the vicinity of the electrified plane our system is very complex, clearly
out  of  equilibrium  and  affected  by  many  different  forces  as:  electrical,
gravitational,  buoyancy  and  some  generalized  thermodynamic  forces.  From  the
competition  of  these  many  effects  arise  the  overall  dynamics  followed  by  the
morphogen.
At  large  distances  (greater that  some  cents  of  micron)  from  the  plane/electrode
the morphogen are assumed as free of forces and evolve describing a Brownian
motion. Closer to the plane, the morphogen feels the effect of a field that change
its  electrochemical  character  (it  loose  it  solvatation  shell).  Once  the  ion  is
stripped  of  the  hydrated  molecules,  it  turns  to  be  very  sensitive  to  the  field
generated by the electrified plane. In this charged state, the morphogen migrates
to  the  plane  to  be  reduced/oxidized.  In  a  neutral  state  it  is  absorbed  in  special
points (the nuclei). The continuous absorption of these particles gives place to a
material  deposit  inside  the  most  external  cells  that  conforms  the  surface.  The
superposition  of  deposits,  arising  from  neighborhood  nuclei,  develops  a  three-
dimensional  structure  whose  form  depends  on  the  geometry  of  the  entire
electrified surface as well as of the spatial nucleus distribution on it. For simplicity
we  work  with  nuclei  disposed  on  a  plane  of  cell  but  it  is  immaterial  if  they  are
disposed on any other kind of surface to form different morphological structures.
A  natural  extension  of  this  approach  consist  to  consider  an  electrified  surface
where  the  potential  in  no  more  constant  but  change  periodically  along  its
extension  such  some  ensemble  of  nucleus  react  with  one  particular  kind  of
morphogen whereas another set of nucleus attract a different type of them. Thus
two  or  more  distinct  particles  can  be  simultaneously  absorbed  by  the  surface.
This  is  an  appealing  idea  because  it  denote  the  possibility  to  get  different
compositional  structures  inside  the  volume  defined  by  the  electrified  surface
without  discarding  possible  reactions  among  the  absorbed  morphogens.  This
hypothesis    favor  diversity  and  plasticity  in  living  systems.    Here  we  limit
ourselves to the simplest case, schematized by the four steps listed below.

1.  The  morphogen,  with  a  solvatation  (hydration)  sphere,  migrate  inside  the

solution bulk describing a free Brownian motion.

2.  Morphogen,  which  randomly  cross  a  hemispherical  surface,  defined  by  a
radius  R ,  will  loose  their  solvatation  shells.  As  shown  in  Figure  1b  this
surface will be named first reaction surface and the radius  R , reaction radius
(a  critical  distance  around  a  nucleus).  The  rate  at  which  the  removal  of  the
solvatation  shells  occurs  on  the  surface  defined  by  the  radius  R     changes
according  the  physical  situation.  The  radius  R   will  be  assumed  constant
during the growth process.

6

3.  Inside the first reaction surface (region II in Figure 1b) the morphogen migrate
towards  an  electro-active  site  performing  a  diffusive  motion  assisted  by  an
electric field.

4.  At  the  electro-active  site,  morphogen  are  reduced  and  ingested  to  improve
the growth. Furthermore, crossing the first hemisphere is not a necessary and
sufficient  condition  for  the  occurrence  of  a  reduction/oxidation  reaction  and
consequent  aggregation  of  the  reduced/oxidized  morphogen  to  the  growing
nucleus.

              As  a  preliminary  to  the  analytical  development  of  the  model,  some
considerations are necessary.

              a) It is assumed a random distribution of nucleus on the plan of cells.

              b) From a theoretical point of view, R is introduced to mimic a cut off of
some potential or generalized thermodynamic potential. That is, R is considered
as a mean distance, from a nucleus, defining a region where the effect of some
field,  acting  on  the  reacting  species,  no  longer  can  be  ignored.  Complexity  is
always connected to systems where many variables, parameters and processes
can  be  present.  Frequently,  the  success  of  a  particular  description  rests  in  the
ability to choice  a few numbers of them, the most important ones. In our case, R
plays  an  important  role  demarcating  the  interface  between  two  regions  where
distinct mechanisms dominate. The introduction of this parameter turns possible
to  obtain  an  analytic  expression  for  a  nonequilibrium  process  where  spatial
inhomogeneities are taking into account.. However, R is not a universal constant
and its magnitude changes according the physical situation without affecting the
model.

              
c) To solve the problem in a realistic way, it is necessary to choose
a  physical  macroscopic  variable    that  could  be  compared  to  those  arising  from
real  the  experiments.  Having  conceived  the  morphogen  as  an  ion,  it  seems
natural to use the electric current density, flowing through the plan of cells during
the electro deposition/absorption process, as the measurable physics parameter.

                      d) Once the motion of a morphogen is Brownian, the analysis must
be carried  in a probabilistic manner therefore, one of our  goals  is  to  determine
the  probability  to  found  a  morphogen    a  distance  R   apart  from  the  center  of  a
super-particle  (the  nucleus).  By  this  procedure  we  obtain  the  flux  of  the
morphogen  through  the  surface  of  the  first  hemisphere.  Then,  knowing  the
probability  that  a  morphogen  is  on  a  nucleus,  after  to  enter  inside  the  first
reaction hemisphere, we  determine the current of the incoming material.

              Following  the  schema  devised  in  Fig.  1,  we  seek  for  a  solution  that
satisfy different boundary conditions in a partitioned space. We work adopting a

two step  procedure.    First  we  derive  the flux    probability,  j R t
the rate the morphogen cross the first hemispherical surface and, then, we define
the  probability,  p r t

              As stated before, inside region I the solvated morphogen perform a free
Brownian motion. On the surface of the first hemisphere they react loosing their
solvated shell. This diffusion-reaction process contemplates two basic situations
characterized  by  the  relative  magnitude  of  the  diffusion  constant,  D ,  and  the
reacting  rate,  K   (the  rate  the  morphogen  loose  their  hydration  shell).  (a)  when

transport. (b) when,  diffusion  turns  to  be  low,  if  compared  to a  K finite value

the reaction on the surface of the first hemisphere is the slowest process and the
dynamic is regulate by reaction.
In both cases, to obtain the probability densities that a Brownian particle is on the
first  reaction  hemisphere  we  use  the  Langevin  formalism  (Nicolis  &  Prigogine
1977) represented by the equations:

(14)  z stands for the charge number characteristic of an ion (morphogen without
its hydrated shell) and  F  is the Faraday constant. Thus  jh  have the dimension of

              Equations (17) and (18) gives the current associated to the reduction of
morphogen incorporated in the cells. The magnitude of the surface is not relevant
but  its  electric  potential  and  the  number  of  nuclei  per  unit  area  it  contains.  In
figure  2    we  shown  the  current  density  curves  generated  from  Eq.  (17)  to  an
arbitrary  case  where:  D
,
s
/
a = 0 .  In  this  case  the  free  parameter  is  the  reaction  radius,  R ,  to  which  is
assigned different values as indicated in the figure caption. In all curves  K ﬁ
on the first hemisphere, such diffusivity has fundamental importance to regulate
the process because it is always the slower variable that regulates the dynamic.
All current curves shows a peak, at the very beginning, followed by  a  retraction
on  its  intensity  toward  a  stationary  value.  According  the  magnitude  of  the
parameter  R   faster  is  attained  this  stationary  value  for  the  currents.  The
theoretical  curves  of  Fig.  2  also  shows  that  diminishing  R   one  soften  the
maximum  and  soon  the  current  are  stabilized.  Due  to  a  lack  of  experimental
result we examine this assertion by inspection to electrochemical realizations and
a  good  correspondence  is  found,  see  D’Ajello,  Fiori  et  al.  (submitted  to
publication).  Notwithstanding  the  differences  between  an  electrochemical  cell
and a biological membrane some typical behaviors must  remain unchanged. For
example,  in  electrochemical  experiments  an  increase  on  R ,  corresponds  to  an
increase on  the  magnitude  of  the  electrostatic  potential.  From  this  we  infer  that
and  increment  on  the  electrostatic  potential  abbreviate  the  transient  regime
because it is increased the driven force acting on the particles. In Fig. 3, a set of
curves,  obtained  from  Eq.  (18)  is  depicted.  They  also  correspond  to  current
transient but, in this case the dominant mechanism is the chemical reaction rate
on the first reaction hemisphere (quantified by  K ). In Fig. 3;  D ,  N ,  n k0
,
are the same as in Fig. 2 but  K  run through two orders of magnitude whereas  R
is fixed at  316 10 4
. The curves show that a decrease in  K  is correlated to a
reduction  of  the  elapsed  time  necessary  to  reach  the  stationary  value.  In  some
sense  a  reduction  in K   is  equivalent  to  a  reduction  in  R   when  working  the
expression  (17).  A  comparison  with  electrochemical  realization  allows  to  infer
that a diminution of  K   corresponds to an increase on the electrical conductivity

of  the  medium.  This  increase  on  the  electrical  conductivity  of  the  medium,  by
they  turn,  favor  the  mass  transport  and  reaction  kinetic  tend  to  prevail,  over
diffusion, to regulate the dynamics. The similar behavior sketched by the curves
Æ 1,  could  gives  the  erroneous  impression  that  just
in  the  cases,  K ﬁ
one expression is necessary to relate both cases. That is not true. To verify this
limitation    we  included  the  curve  (e)  in  Fig.  3.  This  curve  emphasize  a
pathological behavior of expression (18) when   K  is greater than a critical value.
             In  Figs.  4    and  5  we  show  the  same  results  as  in  Figs.  3  and  4  the
difference  rests  on  the  double  normalization  procedure  which  normalize  the
current density,  I  and the time,  t . In Fig. 5 two experimental curves, indicated by
full  circles  and  full  squares,  are  introduced.  They  show  the  current  transients
obtained  during  metallic  deposition  on  n-type  silicon  inside  an  electrolytic  cell.
They  stress  the  fact  that  a  little  potentiostatic  difference  originates  very  disctint
deposition  rates.  The  experimental  curves  are  obtained  in  situations  where  the
electric  potential  difference  between  the  deposition  plane  and  the  reference
electrode indicates  - 1300 mV (full circles) and  - 1100 mV  (full squares).
              The  normalized  graphics  could  be  compared  to  make  evident  that,
under  reaction  control  ( K   smaller  than  D
R 2 );  a  little  time  interval  is  spent  to
achieves the stationary value for the current signal.
              It is important to observe that the  current  density  curves  never  goes  to
zero.  This  fact,  connected  to  biological  systems,  could  be  associated  to  a
constant renovation of the cells inside an organic structure.
             By  economy    we  not  shown  a  situation  where  a
„ 0 .  If  this  parameter
differs  from  zero  there  is  a  continuos  increment  on  the  nuclei  density  and  the
main consequence is to change the derivative of the current curves in the interval

Up to now no explicit function has been proposed to relate  the currents with the
electric  potential,  however  D’Ajello  et  al.  1999  and  D’Ajello,  Fiori  et  al.  had
argued the this relation does exist through the reaction radius.

              In  our  essay  we  have  considered  current  curves  generated  at  fixed
values  for  the  potential,  that  is,  only  one  type  of  morphogen  is  reduced  at  the
surface.  An  improvement  consists  to  consider  the  existence  spatial  dependent
potential such many different kinds of morphogen can be absorbed at the same
time following the magnitude of the electric potential in each point on the surface.
This  assumption  encourages  the  existence  of  many  reactions  inside  the
electrified surface, involving many types of morphogens.

V – CONCLUSIONS

              The  expressions  for  the  current  transient  occurring  in  developmental
processes are introduced. Two limiting situations have been examined to indicate
that ionic flow differs during the early stages of the process. This differences are
connected  to  the  many  mechanism  that  regulates  the  dynamic.  On  the

13

phenomenological  point  of  view  the  model  offers  many  possibilities,  it  favor  an
alternative  to  understand  the  arose  of  many  different  structures  from  a  single
physiological medium introducing a  mechanism  to  select particles and  shape  to
take  into  account  this  diversity.  Obviously  it  has  a  character  speculative.
Measures  can  be  done  refuting  or  correcting  the  assumptions  opening  new
questions  about  the  role  played  by  ionic  currents  on  developmental  processes.
Unfortunately  we  have  no  idea  to  define  the  form  the  electrified  surface  is
conformed  to  determine  the  shape  of  an  organ.  Even  simple  this  model  is  not
inconsistent  with  Wolper  (1981  &1969)  theory  about  positional  information  or
Claudio Stern (1986) expectation's.

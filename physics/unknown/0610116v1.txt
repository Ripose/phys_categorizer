Abstract 
 
 
Evaluation  of  gravity  control  concepts  should  be  examined  with  respect  to  currently  known 

physical theories. In this work we study the hypothetical conversion of gravitational potential 

energy into kinetic energy using the formalism of general relativity. We show that the energy 

involved in the process greatly exceeds the Newtonian estimate, given the nature of general 

relativity.  We  conclude  that  the  impact  of  any  gravity  manipulation  for  propulsion  greatly 

depends fundamentally on its exact definition.

Introduction 
 

Access to space using currently available propulsion systems is extremely limited both 

in distance and in time. In recent years the interest in unconventional propulsion proposals has 

grown in the hope that new forms of propulsion, that increase the range of spacecraft while 

reducing the trip time, are discovered. 

Several  conceptual  mechanisms  have  been  proposed  to  radically  improve  the 

performance  of  propulsion  systems,  such  as  warp-drives1,2,  transient  mass  fluctuations3, 

antigravity4  or  gravitational  shielding  effects5.  While  some  of  these  proposals  are  only 

conceptual, others such as the gravitational shielding have been tested and proved unfruitful6. 

Many of these systems are based on the effect of the  manipulation of mass and gravity in a 

rocket’s  motion.  The  study  of  the  impact  on  propulsion  systems’  performance  of  such 

manipulations has been previously considered and demonstrated that even if gravity could be 

controlled or modified it would not lead to any breakthrough in propulsion systems7. 

Other  conceptual  devices  (e.g.  the  space  drive)  go  even  further,  idealizing  a  form  of 

propulsion without any reaction mass that would somehow manipulate space-time and matter 

to create propulsive forces. One of the possible energy sources for such a device, as suggested 

in Ref. [8], is gravitational potential energy. For concreteness we shall argue along the energy 

considerations as suggested in that reference. In there, it has been proposed that these systems 

could  not  be  analysed  using  rocketry  metrics  and  that  their  full  potential  could  only  be 

understood  in  terms  of  the  energetic  considerations8.  We  understand  that  this  energy  based 

study should be undertaken; nonetheless it should be regarded with caution, especially when 

trying  to  estimate  the  potential  benefits  of  converting  gravitational  potential  energy  into 

kinetic energy. Furthermore, we believe that the results of any approach in the context of the 

Newtonian framework should be considered with great care. 

In the current work we approach this space drive problem from the general relativity 

point of view. For this purpose we consider the energy-momentum pseudo-tensor in order to 

estimate the energy in a given of space-time volume. As expected, we find that the resultant 

energy  is  considerably  larger  than  the  Newtonian  estimate  based  on  the  difference  in  the 

gravitational potential between two distinct points.  

Before  we  present  our  computation  and  discuss  its  implications,  we  review  some  of 

the results presented in Ref. [7] concerning gravity manipulation based on rocketry metrics.

Rocketry Metrics 

 

Classical  propulsion  systems  rely  on  Newton’s  mechanics.  The  foundations  of  these 

propulsion  devices  lie  on  the  conservation  of  linear  momentum  in  a  variable  mass  system 

composed of a rocket and its propellant. 

The  existence  of  hypothetical  devices  capable  of  manipulating  gravity  or  mass  and 

their  influence  on  propulsion  breakthrough  concepts  has  been  studied  in  the  Newtonian 

mechanics framework7. There have been analysed several possible manipulations: 

- 

Inertial mass manipulation (scaling of the inertial mass: mi→ δ mi), 

-  Gravitational mass manipulation (scaling of the gravitational mass: mg → ε mg), 

-  Gravitational field manipulation (scaling of the gravitational coupling G → ε’ G). 

It  has  been  shown  that  even  if  achievable,  these  manipulations  would  not  imply  a 

breakthrough for propulsion, and in some cases they would have to compete with the existing 

technologies.  

The results of these hypothetical manipulations can be summarized as follows:

General Relativity Inspired Energy Considerations 

 

General  relativity  is  currently  the  theory  that  best  describes  gravitational phenomena 

having  been  tested  in  a  wide  variety  of  situations,  from  the  solar  system  up to  larger  scales 

(see e.g. Ref. [10] for a review). 

 In  the  context  of  general  relativity,  gravity  is  interpreted  as  the  curvature  of  a  4-

dimensional  space-time.  The  fundamental  equations  of  general  relativity  are  the  Einstein’s 

Field Equations:

Given that general relativity is the theory that best fits  available data at solar system 

scale  and  beyond,  it  provides  the  most  suitable  framework  to  evaluate  the  potential 

breakthrough for propulsion of any system that hypothetically converts gravitational potential 

energy into kinetic energy. 

We  argue  that  in  dealing  with  gravity  manipulation  using  Newtonian  mechanics  is 

somewhat misleading given that Newton’s gravity is concerned only with the dynamics along 

field lines. Given the nature of general relativity one should expect that any manipulation of 

gravity has global consequences since it would affect the space-time in its surroundings. In a 

previous approach it has been suggested that the amount of energy available for conversion in 

a trip between two points separated by a distance L in a Newtonian gravitational field is given 

by 8: 

 

U N =

GMm
L

 

(2) 

However since general relativity describes space-time dynamics  as a whole it allows 

for a more accurate understanding of the impact of a hypothetical gravity manipulation. 

Energy  conservation  in  a  certain  volume  of  space  requires  that  any  hypothetical 

gravity  manipulation  can  convert  only  a  fraction  of  the  energy  available  in  the  volume 

element  into  kinetic  energy  and  for  that  it  must  have  energy  resources  to  manipulate  the 

space-time in question. 

In  order  to  estimate  this  energy,  we  compute  the  energy  available  in  a  space-time 

volume near a spherically symmetric mass, like the Sun. To do so it is necessary to introduce 

some general relativistic formalism. 

gravitational field can be expressed as11,12:

Of course, the energy-momentum pseudo-tensor formalism is just an approximation to 

the complex problem of defining mass in general relativity without ambiguity. Nevertheless, 

since our computation is carried in the weak field limit, that is, in post-Newtonian limit, it is 

fairly accurate for our purposes.  

approximation, the metric can be written as:

To  compute  these  integrals  is  necessary  to  choose  a  particular  geometrical  setting. 

Considering  that  we  are  dealing  with  a  device  that  somehow  manipulates  space-time  in  the 

surroundings  of  the  spacecraft  as  it  moves,  it  is  hence  natural  to  consider  a  cylinder  as  the 

volume  element.  Of  course  one  could  consider  a  different  geometrical  configuration,  i.e.  a 

conical  geometry,  given  the  radial  nature  of  gravity.  However,  this  would  not  change 

significantly our results. For the proposed setting, a cylinder type configuration seems  more 

appropriate,  but  this  is  for  sure  not  a  fundamental  issue.  The  key  question  is  that  general 

relativity suggests that gravity manipulation involves necessarily a volume integration.  

Computing  these  integrals  in  cylindrical  coordinates  with  with  0<r<R,        0<  θ<2π  and 

Rsun<z<L (see Figure 1) we obtain:

This result should be regarded with caution since its significance greatly depends on 

what  we  define  as  gravity  control.  Defining  gravity  control  simply  as  the  conversion  of 

potential  energy  in  a  certain  volume  into  kinetic  energy  then  Eq.  (19)  tells  us  that  there  is 

more energy available for conversion than in the Newtonian approach. Such a result is due to 

the fact  that in this general relativity point of view we are  dealing with a  certain volume of 

space-time  instead  of  just  two  distinct  points  in  space.  On  the  other  hand  if  we  understand 

gravity manipulation as the control over a region of space-time to extract energy from it, Eq 

(19) represents the energy required to manipulate the considered volume of space-time. In this 

sense  and  under  the  specified  conditions,  we  have  shown  that  the  required  energy  greatly 

exceeds the Newtonian energy estimate. In the former interpretation of gravity manipulation 

required to change space-time leads to no energy gain for spacecraft propulsion. 

Conclusions and Outlook 

The  possibility  of  manipulating  gravity  to  extend  space  travelling  to  interstellar 

distances  and  to  reduce  trip  time  is  an  interesting  topic  from  the  physics  and  from  the 

propulsion point of view. Evaluating the potential of any gravity manipulation concept must 

be carried out in the context of the currently theories of physics. 

In  this  work  we  approached  these  issues  using  the  general  relativity  framework. 

Through  the  use  of  the  energy-momentum  pseudo-tensor  of  the  gravitational  field  we 

estimated  the  energy  contained  in  a  volume  of  space-time.  Our  results  reveal  that  there  is 

more potential energy than in the previous Newtonian estimate. However the interpretation of 

this result greatly depends on the exact definition of gravity manipulation. Understanding our 

calculation  as the energy available  for conversion leads to an encouraging conclusion, since 

the  energy available is  much  larger than previously estimated. On the  other hand, regarding 

this  result  as  the  energy  that  must  be  spent  to  control  a  region  of  space-time,  leads  to  a 

radically different conclusion. From this point of view, gravity manipulation is an essentially 

unfruitful process for propulsion purposes.

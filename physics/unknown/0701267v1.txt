Abstract:
This  article  presents  empirical  models  for  the  relationship  between  peak  ballistic  pressure  wave  magnitude  and 
incapacitation times in the Strasbourg goat test data.  Using a model with the expected limiting behavior at large and 
small  pressure  wave  magnitudes,  the  average  incapacitation  times  are  highly  correlated  (R  =  0.91)  with  peak 
pressure wave magnitude.  The cumulative incapacitation probability as a function of time reveals both fast (t < 5 s) 
and slow (t > 5 s) incapacitation mechanisms.   The fast incapacitation mechanism can be accurately modeled as a 
function of peak pressure wave magnitude.  The slow incapacitation mechanism is presumably due to blood loss via 
damaged vascular tissue.

Introduction 

I.
Selecting  service  caliber  handgun  loads  with  the  greatest 
potential  for  rapid  incapacitation  of  violent  criminal  or 
terrorist  attackers  is  of  interest  to  law  enforcement  [PAT89].  
This  interest  has  fueled  heated  debate  on  the  merits  of  some 
contributions.    The  debate  on  whether  a  ballistic  pressure 
wave  plays  a  role  in  incapacitation  has  been  reviewed 
elsewhere,  and  a  hypothesis  has  been  formed  that  a  pressure 
wave  can  play  a  role  in  rapid  incapacitation  by  handgun 
bullets [COC06a, COC06b].

Pressure wave hypothesis:
Other  factors  being  equal,  bullets  producing  larger  pressure 
waves  incapacitate  more  rapidly  than  bullets  producing 
smaller pressure waves.

The  Strasbourg 
effectiveness  in  goats  by  shooting  the  test  subjects  broadside 
through  the  center  of  the  chest  and  recording  the  time  to 
incapacitation  (falling  down).    These  tests  employed  a 
pressure  sensor  inserted  into  the  carotid  artery  of  live 
unanaesthetized  goats.    These  tests  directly  suggest  that  an 
internal pressure  wave created by the interaction of the bullet 
and  tissue  can  contribute  to  rapid  incapacitation  and  can 
incapacitate  more  quickly  than  the  crush  cavity/blood  loss 
mechanism alone:  

In  a  substantial  number  of  cases,  the  subject  was  incapacitated 
almost  instantly.    Each  time  this  occurred,  between  two  and  five 
pressure  spike  tracings  of  high  amplitude  and  short  duration  were 
found  which  immediately  preceded  and  matched  corresponding, 
diffused,  or  flattened  lines  (EEG  tracings).    Normally,  the  time  lag 
between  the  first  pressure  spike  and  the  beginning  of  slowed  or 

flattened  lines  was  between  30  and  40  milliseconds  (although  there 
were  several  cases  where  this  delay 
lasted  as  long  as  80 
milliseconds)…The  taller  pressure  spike  tracings  always  preceded 
the  slowed  or  flat  line  tracing…The  initial  spikes  had  to  be  of  a 
certain height in order for the animal to collapse immediately.

The  Strasbourg  tests  have  been  criticized  on  a  number  of 
counts  [FAC94a,  FAC97a].      A  review  of  these  criticisms 
[COC06a]  shows  them  to  be  invalid  and  unconvincing 
because they contain numerous ad hominem attacks, appeal to 
unidentified  authorities,  and  other  fallacious  reasoning.    The 
review concludes:

In  the  absence  of  support  or  direct  contradiction  from  any  other 
experiments,  the  veracity  of  the  Strasbourg  tests  should  fairly  be 
considered  to be an open question...Rather  than lean too heavily on 
(possibly biased) expert opinions, the veracity of the report should be 
determined  by the  degree to  which the  reported  results find  support 
in other experimental findings.

The  relationship  between  pressure  wave  and  incapacitation 
times  in  the  Strasbourg  tests  are  consistent  with  ballistic 
pressure  waves causing remote  brain  injury  in pigs  [SHS90a, 
SHS90b,  SHK90,  SHL89,  SHS88,  SHS87],  observations  of 
remote  brain  injury  in  dogs  [WWZ04],  and  observations  of 
incapacitation  and  traumatic  brain  injury  in  fluid  percussion 
model  research  [THG97,  TLM05,  and  references  therein].  
The  results  also  have  quantitative  agreement  with  an 
incapacitation  study  in  deer  [COC06d],  and  correlations 
between  incapacitation  and  pressure  wave  magnitude  in 
humans [COC06b].  Remote ballistic pressure wave injury has 
also been reported in humans [OBW94].

Physics of the ballistic pressure wave

II.
The  origin  of  the  pressure  wave  is  Newton’s  third  law.    The 
bullet slows down in tissue due to the force the tissue applies 
to the bullet.  By Newton’s third law, the bullet exerts an equal 
and opposite force on the tissue.  When a force is applied to a 
fluid  or  a  visco-elastic  material  such  as  tissue  or  ballistic 
gelatin, a pressure wave radiates outward in all directions from 
the location where the force is applied.  

The  instantaneous  magnitude  of  the  force,  F,  between  the 
bullet and the tissue is given by

F = dE/dx,

Where  E  =  ½  mV2  is  the  instantaneous  kinetic  energy  of  the 
bullet, and x is the instantaneous penetration distance.   dE/dx 
is  the  first  derivative  of  the  energy  with  respect  to  the 
penetration depth.  In other words, it is the local rate of kinetic 
energy loss per unit of penetration depth.  Losing 100 ft-lbs of 
kinetic energy in 0.02 feet of penetration would create a force 
of 5,000 lbs because 100 ft-lbs/0.02 ft = 5,000 lbs.

This  force  (equal  to  the  local  rate  of  energy  loss)  changes 
continuously and depends on both the loss of velocity and the 
loss of  mass (unless the  mass is constant).  By the chain  rule 
of calculus,

F = dE/dx = ½ V2  dm/dx + m V dV/dx,

where  dm/dx  and  dV/dx  are  the  local  rates  of  mass  and 
velocity loss with respect to penetration depth.

Applying this formula directly requires detailed knowledge of 
the  instantaneous  mass  and  velocity  changes  of  a  bullet  at 
every point along the wound channel.  The instantaneous force 
can  be  accurately  estimated  by  shooting  the  same  bullet 
through  varying  thicknesses  of  ballistic  gelatin.    In  other 
words, one might shoot through a 0.05 ft thick block of gelatin 
to  determine  the  loss  of  energy  in  the  first  0.05  ft  of 
penetration.  Then one might shoot through a 0.1 ft thick block 
of  gelatin  to  determine  the  loss  of  energy  in  a  0.1  ft  thick 
block of gelatin.  Then one might shoot through a 0.15 ft thick 
block  of  gelatin  to  determine  the  loss  of  energy  in  a  0.15  ft 
thick  block  of  gelatin.    Repeating  this  process  using  small 
increments,  and  applying  standard  techniques  for  estimating 
derivatives  from  measured  values  at  closely  spaced  points 
would  yield  an  accurate  measurement  of  the  instantaneous 
force at every penetration depth.

There  are  some  simple  and  reasonable  estimates  that  can  be 
made  more  easily.    In  cases  where  the  mass  is  constant,  the 
average force  Fave between the  tissue and  bullet is simply the 
initial kinetic energy E divided by the penetration depth d.  

Fave = E/d.

For  example, a  bullet impacting with a  kinetic energy  of 500 
ft-lbs and penetrating a depth of 12” (1 foot) exerts an average 
force of 500 lbs on the medium.

The  peak  of  any  variable  force  is  larger  than  the  average 
value.    The  peak  force  usually  occurs  during  or  soon  after 
expansion, and most bullets have peak to average force ratios 
between 3 and 8.  Bullets that do not expand, penetrate deeply, 
and lose energy gradually have a peak to average ratio close to 
3.  Bullets that expand rapidly, lose a lot of energy early, erode 
to a smaller diameter and then penetrate deeply have a peak to 
average  ratio  close  to  8.    Nosler  Partition  rifle  bullets  with 
their soft lead front section which expands rapidly and erodes 
away quickly leaving the base containing roughly 60% of the 
original  mass  at  little  more  than  the  unexpanded  diameter 
provide an example of large peak to average force ratio.  

Most JHP  handgun bullets  have a peak to average ratio close 
to 5, so this can provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the 
peak force in many cases.

Fpeak = 5 E/d.

As  discussed  elsewhere  [COC06b],  fragmentation  increases 
the peak retarding force.

Pressure is simply defined as force per unit area.  This means 
that  the  pressure  on  the  front  of  a  bullet  is  simply  the  force 
divided by the frontal area of the bullet.  The pressure exerted 
by the medium on the bullet is equal to the pressure exerted by 
the bullet on the medium.  Because the frontal area of a bullet 
is small, the pressure at the front of the bullet is large.

Once created, this large pressure front travels outward from its 
source  in  all  directions  in  a  viscous  or  visco-elastic  medium.  
As  the  wave  propagates  outward,  the  decrease  in  pressure 
magnitude  is  dominated  by  the  increasing  total  area  the 
pressure wave covers.  

This decrease in pressure is analogous to the decrease in light 
intensity  with  increasing  distance  from  a  light  bulb  and  the 
decrease in blast wave pressure with increasing distance from 
an explosion.  The effective area of a pressure wave a distance 
2

R from the source is 
 (the surface area of a sphere 
of radius R).   Consequently, the peak pressure P generated by
an  expanding  bullet  a  distance  R  from  the  bullet  path  in  a 
liquid or visco-elastic medium is

For example, the bullet impacting with a kinetic energy of 500 
ft-lbs  and  penetrating  to  a  depth  of  1  foot  creates  a  pressure  
wave  with  a  peak  magnitude  of  796  PSI  at  the  edge  of  a  1” 
diameter  circle  centered  on  the  bullet  path.    We  will  use  the 

"1P  to  indicate  the  peak  pressure  at  the  edge  of  a  1” 

symbol 
diameter circle centered on the bullet path.

The magnitude of a pressure wave will fall off with increasing 
distance  from  the  point  of  origin  unless  reflected  by  a 
boundary or confined to an internal structure such as an artery.  
An internal pressure wave created in the thoracic cavity of an 
animal will be reflected many times by the sides of the cavity. 
The law of superposition can create localized  regions of high 
pressure  by  focusing  the  wave,  just  as  a  concave  mirror  can 
focus  a  light  wave  and  a  concave  surface  can  focus  a  sound 
wave.  

In addition, a pressure wave confined to a tube will travel the 
length  of  the  tube  with  little  attenuation  and  can  actually 
increase in  magnitude  if the tube narrows.  This is analogous 
to  a  light wave confined  to  a  fiber  optic  or  the blast  pressure 
wave from an  explosion  confined  to  a  tunnel.  Consequently, 
once  the  pressure  wave  reaches  a  major  artery,  it  can  be 
transmitted 
the  artery  with  only  small 
attenuation.    Think  about  hitting  a  fluid-filled  garden  hose 
with  a  hammer.    The  pressure  wave  created  by  the  hammer 
strike  will  travel  the  length  of  the  hose  with  relatively  little 
loss of amplitude per foot of travel.

The  fact  that  the  average  magnitude  of  the  ballistic  pressure 
wave is inversely proportional to penetration depth means that 
cutting  the  penetration  depth  in  half  (for  a  given  amount  of 
kinetic energy), doubles the pressure.  However, this property 
will  only  increase  incapacitation  up  to  a  point,  because  the 
pressure  wave  must  be  created  inside  of  a  visco-elastic 
medium and in close proximity to major blood vessels or vital 
organs to  have  its effect.    A bullet that  fails to  penetrate into 
the  thoracic  cavity  or  that  barely  penetrates  might  have  little 
effect.  Once the penetration is below 9” or so, we expect the 
impact of the pressure wave will be reduced [COC06b].

The  important  parameter  when  considering  blood  loss  as  an 
incapacitation  mechanism  is  the  permanent  crush  cavity, 
which represents the crushed tissue that is left in the wake of a 
bullet.  It can be estimated (FBI method) as the frontal area of 
the  expanded  bullet  times  the  penetration  depth. 
  For 
predicting  bullet  effectiveness, 
this  expanded  area  and 
penetration  depth  are  commonly  measured  in  10%  ballistic 
gelatin.  The volume of the permanent crush cavity  measured 
in  this  way  is  designated  Vpcc  and  is  proportional  to  the 
penetration depth. 

The  fact  that  Vpcc  is  linearly  related  to  the  penetration  depth

tradeoff  is  one  key  element  in  designing  and  selecting 
ammunition  for  a  particular  application  and  risk  assessment.  
There  has  been  much  debate  in  the  literature  about  the 
optimum  penetration  depth(s)  for  law  enforcement  and  self-
defense applications.

where E is the kinetic energy (in ft-lbs) of the bullet at impact, 
and d is the penetration depth (in feet).

One  can  consider  what  physical  quantity  related  to  bullet 
performance  might  be  well  correlated  to  the  Strasbourg 
average  incapacitation  times. 
  There  is  some  difficulty 
attempting  to  correlate  the  average  incapacitation  times  with 
bullet  performance  parameters  of  the  full  data  set  because 
many  of  these  loads  are  no  longer  commercially  available.  
Consequently, we consider a subset of loads for which there is 
sufficient data available in the published literature to estimate 
the  pressure  wave  and  determine  the  bullet  performance 
parameters  of interest.    (The  loads  we  consider  are  listed  in 
Appendix B.)

Performing  linear  least-squares  fits  (using  a  third  order 
polynomial)  to  the  average incapacitation times  as  a  function 
of  various  performance  parameters  yields  the  correlation 
coefficients and standard errors shown in Table 1.  

The  average  incapacitation  times  (AIT)  were  correlated  with 
the following bullet parameters:

Model for average incapacitation time

Average Incapacitation Time vs. Peak Pressure Wave Magnitude

where  p0  is  the  characteristic  pressure  wave  that  gives  an 
average incapacitation time of 10 seconds.  Performing a least-
squares fit gives p0 = 482 PSI with a standard error of 1.64 s 
and a correlation coefficient of R = 0.91.  A plot of AIT(p) is 
shown in Figure 1 along with the data.

The graph shows that while increasing the peak pressure wave 
magnitude  from  100  PSI  to  1000  PSI  provides  significant 
gains  in  reduced  incapacitation  times,  increasing  the  peak 
pressure wave above 1000 PSI yields diminishing returns.

Cumulative probability distributions

V.
It  is useful to  graph the cumulative incapacitation probability 
distributions  as  a  function  of  time.    Because  each  load  only 
has  five data  points,  we  group  10 different  loads  together  for 
each  cumulative  probability  distribution  and  use  the  average 
pressure wave to characterize the results.  Group A combines 
the  10  loads  with  the  lowest  average  incapacitation  times.  
Group  B  combines  the  10  loads  with  the  next  lowest  10 
average incapacitation times, and so on.

Figure  2  shows  the  cumulative  probability  distribution  for 
Group  C. 
  These  distributions  all  share  the  following 
characteristics:    There  is  very  little  chance  of  creating  truly 
immediate  incapacitation.    All  distributions  show  100%  
chance  of  eventual  incapacitation.    This  is  because  a  shot 
through the lungs will eventually cause a blood pressure drop 
sufficient  for  incapacitation.    However,  the  different  groups 
can  be  characterized  by  the  degree  to  which  they  give 
evidence of rapid incapacitation (< 5 seconds).

Newgard  made  a  compelling  case  that  blood  loss  alone  will 
very  seldom  produce  incapacitation  in  under  5  seconds 
[NEW92]:

For  an  average  70  kg  (155  lb.) male  the  cardiac  output  will  be 5.5 
liters (~1.4 gallons) per minute. His blood volume will be 60 ml per

kg  (0.92  fl.  oz.  per  lb.)  or  4200  ml  (~1.1  gallons).  Assuming  his 
cardiac output can double under stress (as his heart beats faster and 
with  greater  force),  his  aortic  blood  flow  can  reach  11  liters  (~2.8 
gallons)  per  minute.  If  one  assumes  a  wound  that  totally  severs  the 
thoracic  aorta,  then  it  would  take  4.6  seconds  to  lose  20%  of  his 
blood  volume from one  point of injury.  This is the  minimum  time in
which a person could lose 20% of his blood volume. 

These theoretical ideas are confirmed by many observations of 
deer  almost  always  taking  5-10  seconds  to  fall  with  any 
broadside archery shot hit through the center of the chest.  In 
contrast,  we  have  observed  numerous  deer  drop  in  under  5 
seconds  when hit by handgun bullets creating pressure  waves 
at the larger end of the spectrum [COC06d].  Likewise, events 
of  apparently  involuntary  incapacitation  in  under  5  seconds 
are  repeatedly  reported  in  humans  for  handgun  shots  which 
fail to hit the CNS or supporting bone structure.

Therefore,  we  will  model 
distribution, P(t), as having a fast and a slow component.

unlike  the  blood  loss  mechanism,  the  probability  of  eventual

several  groups  with  different  pressure  magnitudes,  we  will 
show  that  tf  and  A0  are  correlated  with  peak  pressure  wave 
magnitude.

correspondence with the experimental probability distribution 
for Group C yields: A0 = 0.329(24), tf = 4.82 s (.23), and ts = 
10.2507  s  (.086).1          Figure  3  shows  the  best-fit  P(t)  along 
with  the  component  slow  and  fast  probability  curves  for  the 
best fit values of Group C.  This model and fitting results can 
be interpreted to imply that a load with a peak pressure of 683 
PSI will produce rapid incapacitation roughly 33% of the time 
with a typical time scale of 4.8 s.

Repeating  this  process  for  Group  A  through  Group  F2
produces  the  values  of  A0,  tf,  and  ts  shown  in  Table  2,  along 
with  the  average  peak  pressure  magnitude  of  these  groups.  

                                                
1 Numbers in parentheses represent estimated uncertainty in least 
significant digits.
2  At  incapacitation  times/pressure  wave  magnitudes  smaller  than 
Group F, the fast response mechanism is no longer discernable in the 
probability  curves.    Since  only  the  slow  mechanism  gives  clear 
evidence of acting in Groups G and H, these data sets cannot be used 
to  reliably  estimate  A0  and  tf  for  the  smaller  pressure  wave 
magnitudes.

There  is  a  trend  that  the  maximum  probability  of  the  fast 
mechanism  producing  incapacitation  (A0),  increases  with 
pressure  wave  magnitude.    This  trend  is  a  bit  muddy  below 
700 PSI because of the relatively small probability of the fast 
incapacitation  mechanism  at 
levels.  
However, the trend is clear above 700 PSI.  Likewise, there is 
a  trend  that  the  time  scale  of  the  fast  mechanism,  tf,  tends  to 
decrease with increasing pressure wave magnitude.

Peak Pressure Wave Magnitude (PSI)

Figure  4:  Probability  of  eventual  incapacitation  via  the  fast 
mechanism plotted vs. pressure wave magnitude for Group A through 
Group  F.    There  is  no  clear  trend  below  700  PSI,  but  the  trend  is 
clearly increasing above 700 PSI.

There  is  a  clearer  trend  that  the  time  scale  of  the  fast 
mechanism,  tf,  tends  to  decrease  with  increasing  pressure 
wave  magnitude.    The  fast  response  time,  tf,  is  inversely 
proportional  to  the  peak  pressure  wave  magnitude,  as  shown 
in Figure 5.  The solid curve is the result of a least-squares fit

Discussion

VI.
This analysis has shown that the Strasbourg test incapacitation 
times are highly correlated to peak pressure  wave magnitude.  
Both  the  average  incapacitation  times  and  the  probability 
distribution of incapacitation times demonstrate pressure wave 
effects.  There appears to be both fast and slow mechanisms in 
play.  The fast mechanism depends strongly on peak pressure 
wave  magnitude  and  is  easily  discernable  and  fast  acting 
(under  5  seconds)  for  pressure  wave  magnitudes  above  700 
PSI on the diameter of a 1” diameter cylinder concentric with 
the wound channel.

This  shows  that,  all  other  factors  being  equal,  bullets  that 
produce  pressure  waves  of  greater  magnitude  incapacitate 
more rapidly than bullets that produce smaller pressure waves.  
The  Strasbourg  test  data  convincingly  supports  the  pressure 
wave hypothesis and allows (perhaps for the first time) the fast 
response  time  to  be  modeled  as  a  function  of  peak  pressure 
wave magnitude.  

It is worth noting that the A0 determined from Group A is too 
small  to  model  accurately3  with  a  one  parameter  S  curve 

                                                
3  One  might  think  that  the  large  error  bars  in  the  data  set  would 
preclude  a  high  level  of  confidence in  this  statement.    However,  we 
have  looked  at  the  data  carefully  with  a  number  of  different

increasing monotonically from 0 to 1 with increasing pressure 
wave magnitude.  This is consistent with observations in deer.  
Even  at  rifle  levels  of  peak  pressure  wave  magnitude  (p  > 
2000  PSI),  a  significant  fraction  of  deer  remain  on  their  feet 
for over 5 seconds.  The goat model for A0 shown in Figure 6 
increases  monotonically  from  0  to  0.7  to  account  for  these 
observations.

Peak Pressure Wave Magnitude (PSI)

Figure  6:  Possible  models  for  A0(p)  in  goats  and  humans 
compared with goat data.

On the other hand, Marshall and Sanow [MAS96] observe that 
nearly  all  humans  are  instantly incapacitated  by  a  shot  to  the 
chest with a .308 using expanding or fragmenting bullets (that 
create a very large pressure wave).  This suggests that humans 
are  more  sensitive  to  pressure  wave  effects  than  deer  and 
goats,  with  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  A0 closer  to  1.  
Behavior of A0 in humans is probably more like the red curve 
in Figure 6 than the blue curve.

One  might  note  a  seeming  contradiction  of  an  average 
incapacitation  time that is inversely proportional to p1/2 and  a 
fast  incapacitation  time  tf  that  is  inversely  proportional  to  p.  
There is no contradiction, because the data set as a whole (and 
thus  the  general  trend  of  the  average  incapacitation  time  in 
Figure  1)  depends  more  strongly  on  the  slow  incapacitation 
mechanism,  which  is  presumably  dominated  by  blood  loss 
caused  by  vascular  tissue  damage.    Both  the  cross  sectional 
and surface area of damaged tissue are expected to be roughly 
proportional to p1/2 if we consider a region of tissue in which 
the pressure wave magnitude exceeds some pressure threshold 
required  for  vascular  damage.    In  contrast,  the  pressure 
magnitude reaching the central  nervous system is expected to 
be proportional to p.  

                                                                                    
exploratory  data  analysis  techniques,  and  we  are  confident  that  A0
does not approach 1 asymptotically.

7

Even  if  the  data  set  (as  graphed  in  Figure  1)  extended  into 
sufficiently  high  pressure  ranges  for  the  fast  mechanism  to 
dominate, the 30% of cases where the fast mechanism did not 
occur  would  still  determine 
the  scaling  of  average 
incapacitation  times  with  pressure  wave  magnitude,  and  it 
would remain inversely proportional to p1/2 in goats and deer.  
In  contrast,  the  scaling  of  average  incapacitation  times  in 
humans  would  probably  be  inversely  proportional  to  p  for 
large  p.    As A0 approaches 1, the  fast  mechanism completely 
dominates the average incapacitation time.

Cautions and Limits of Interpretation

A.
Goats are not people, and the shot angle used in the Strasbourg 
tests  was  particularly  favorable 
loads  with  shallow 
penetration.    It  would  be  an  error  to  infer  that  the  loads  that 
worked  well in the  goat  tests  would  necessarily  work  well in 
self-defense  applications  with  a  variety  of  shot  angles  and 
different penetration requirements.

to 

Do  not  be  overly  impressed  by  the  propensity  for  shallow 
penetrating  loads  to  produce  larger  pressure  waves.    Bullet 
required 
the 
selection  criteria  should 
penetration  depth 
risk  assessment  and 
the  given 
application,  and  only  use  pressure  wave  magnitude  as  a 
selection  criterion  for  bullets  which  meet  a  minimum 
penetration requirement.

first  determine 

for 

Reliable  expansion,  penetration,  feeding,  and  functioning  are 
all important aspects of load testing and selection.  It would be 
unwise  to  abandon  long-held  aspects  of  the  load  testing  and 
selection process, but it seems prudent to consider the pressure 
wave magnitude along with other factors.

Implications for Bullet Design

B.
The  trend  in  bullet  design  over  the  last  decade  has  drifted 
toward  bullets  with 
little  fragmentation  and  a  higher 
percentage  of  retained  mass.    Bullets  that  both  fragment  and 
meet minimum penetration requirements create larger pressure 
wave  magnitudes  and  offer  improved  incapacitation  potential 
[COC06b].  

In  addition  to  moving  toward  designs  which  both  penetrate 
and  fragment  reliably,  the  incapacitation  potential  of  a  bullet 
improved  by  delaying  expansion  and 
can  be 
fragmentation to a penetration depth of at least 4”.  This would 
place the peak pressure magnitude closer to vital organs.

further 

Optimal  use  of  a  bullet’s  kinetic  energy  to  produce  pressure 
wave  incapacitation  suggests  a  bullet  design  that  penetrates 
the first 4” or so prior to significant expansion or energy loss, 
and  then  rapidly  expands  and  transfers  a  large  percentage  of 
its energy and 40% of its mass at penetration depths between 
4-8” before continuing to penetrate to the depth desired for the 
application.

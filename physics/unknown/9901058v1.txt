Magnetic  interaction  between  a  weighing  sample  and  an  external  magnetic  field  allows  to
measure characteristics of magnetic field (a sample with known magnetic characteristics), as well
as  the  magnetic  properties  of  a  sample  (a  known  magnetic  field).  Measurement  of  materials‘
magnetic permeability is a well known application of this method [1, 2].

In this paper we restrict ourselves to the measurement of magnetic field spatial distribution,
which  was  achieved  by  scanning  of    samples  from  known  materials  along  the  vertical  axis.  Field
measurements by Hall‘s detector were done to calibrate obtained data. Such measurements are of
great interest in some branches of physics, in particular, in accelerator physics, where the quality
of magnetic system parts eventually determine the quality of accelerated bunches. Development of
a  simple  and  cheep  device  for  measurement  of  magnetic  field  spatial  distribution  is  an  urgent
problem  [3].  The  developed  system  for  gravimetric  measurement  of  magnetic  field  gradients
partially solves this problem.

We  are  mainly  interested  in  two  cases:  when  the  magnetic  moment  is  entirely  induced  and  is
determined  by  the  magnetic  permeability 
of  the  sample‘s  material  and,  the  second,  when  the
magnetic moment is independent of the external field.

µ  

In the first case one has to take into account the proportionality of magnetic moment to the
r
H i   of  the  sample,  which  in  its  turn,  is  determined  by  the  external  magnetic  field,
internal  field 
magnetic susceptibilty and sample’s geometric form. For an axially symmetric sample located in an
axially symmetric magnetic field the interaction force is defined as follows [1]:

When studying samarium-cobalt magnets in the fields of the order of Earth‘s magnetic field
one  also  can  ignore  the  induced  magnetization,  i.e.  one  can  consider  M z   as  independent  of  the
external field.

The scanning of a sample along the  z  axis gives an information about the spatial distribution
of the interaction force, which restores the gradient of the magnetic field square (2) or immediately
the field’s gradient up to a constant factor (3).

2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

2.1. String Tension Pickup
A  specially  developed  String  Tension  Pickup  (STP)  was  used  to  measure  the  force  of
interaction  between  the  sample  and  magnetic  field.  String  magnetometer  [2]  with  some
improvements was taken as a prototype. In particular, by special means the lower end of the string
with load was fixed in horizontal plane. As strings were used golden tungsten or beryl bronze wires
of diameter 100 
×

The  magnetic  system  was  made  on  the  basis  of  samarium-cobalt  permanent  magnets  of
sizes  12
4mm  and  a  magnetic  circuit  consisting  of  two  symmetric  parts  from  steel  3.  As  a
result a C-form magnetic system was obtained, which closes the magnetic flow circuit  through the
gap with string. During the experiments pickups with 10 to 150 mm long strings were used.

µ

×

An  electromechanical  generator  excited  the  string  oscillations  due  to  the  interaction  of
alternating current through the string with the magnetic field in the magnet gap. Positive feedback
in  the  electric  part  of  the  generator  excites  and  keeps  self  oscillations  frequency  close  to  its
mechanical resonance.

µ

The construction  of STP allowed to tune  normal  oscillations frequency  on  each  of  first  five
harmonics.  The  first  harmonic  with  loop  in  the  middle  turned  to  be  the  most  convenient  for
measurements.  The  frequency  corresponding  to  the  first  harmonic  on  the  beryl  bronze  wire  of
diameter  100
m  and  length  some  40mm  was  about  3kHz  at  the  tension  3N.  A  system  of  forced
automatic  regulation  keeps  a  stable  current  in  the  string,  which  allows  to  select  its  value  to
maximise the stability of its normal oscillations frequency. The frequency was multiplied by a factor
32  before measurement,  and this  along with  normal  oscillations high  stability  allowed  to  measure
frequency  with  accuracy  0.03Hz  during  1sec.  Increasing  the  measurement  time  up  to  10sec.
allowed to achieve accuracy 0.003Hz.

≤

Mentioned measures allowed to increase the level of relative sensitivity of STP up to 10

 at
 3N. Since  the  magnetometric measurements  were  done  by  slow  rate  scanning,  it  was
-5
. A special method of fixation of the string‘s

the  load 
necessary to provide long time stability at the level 10
lower end practically excludes wire’s drawing out of clips.

Pickup’s  thermostabilisation  was  done  in  two  ways:  either  in  analogue  mode  or  by  the
programme  using  one  of  the  eight  digital  outputs  of  the  interface  board.  This  allowed  to  achieve
long-time  stability  during  many  hours.  Fig.  1  shows  a  typical  behaviour  of  pickup  readings  at
permanent  load  2.25N  during  more  than  64  hours.    During  the  mentioned  measurements  the
pickup head was  thermostabilised  in ON/OFF  mode by a  programme  via solid  state relay  using  a
signal from a thermistor. Since the thermistor was located on a massive base immediately near the
0
heater, the temperature fluctuation was about 1 mV (2.5
C), although the temperature of the base
was stabilised with accuracy 0.1

0
C.

2.2. Scanner
For scanning of magnetic field by moving the samples along  z  axis a pulley-block lift system
200  and low turn reductor. The rotation speed was regulated

was made using a step engine  DSI$
by PC. The speed of scanning varied from parts of mm to few mm per second.

2.3. Software
The  whole  system  was  computerised.  A  computer  board  with  two  frequency  inputs  (up  to
1.5MHz  and 10MHz),  three  analogue inputs,  eight  digital  outputs  and  a  RS-232  port  served  as  a
base  interface  board.  The  system  was  tested  on  computers  IBM  286  to  Pentium.  DOS  and

4

Windows programmes  were developed.  During the  whole experiment  the data  from  STP  or  Hall’s
detector were visualised on monitor, saved in file and processed later.

2.4. Samples
Rings from soft magnetic steel, permalloy as well as of samarium-cobalt permanent magnets
×
×
of  sizes  12 
  4mm  serve  as  samples.  Note  that  usage  of  ferromagnetic  samples  in  strong
magnetic  fields  entails  some  difficulties  caused  by  nonhomogenous  and  non-linear  dependence
between magnetisation of samples’ material and the external  field.  Since  the measurements  were
done  in  weak  magnetic  fields  and  had  demonstration  character,  we  had  ignored 
this
nonhomogenousity.  To  measure  gradient  of  string  magnetic  fields  one  have  to  use  para-  or
diamagnetic materials and the sensitivity of pickup allows to do it.

2.5. Hall detectors system
To calibrate the  gravimetric measurement system  it was  supplied  by Hall’s  detectors. Note
that to measure the  weak magnetic  fields  by Hall’s  detector serious  difficulties  were overcame  to
eliminate  of  strays  arising,  in  particular,  from  switching  of  current  and  potentials  at  each
measurement.

Measurement of magnetic field by Hall detectors were done at alternating sine form current
of frequency 1kHz (amplitude of the current through the pickup was about 100mA). Output signal
was applied to the input of selective nanovoltmeter SN237 with narrow bandwidth and current gain
3
. Direct voltage signal from selective nanovoltmeter output was converted to match the interface
10
board input. Polling of Hall’s detectors was done during a few ms at each second. The  current in
coils was switched on/off via interface board regulation channel by means of a solid state relay, the
"on" state time being 20sec., "off" - 40sec. This allowed to compare signals from Hall’s detectors
at on/off state of current in coils, in such way excluding the zero drift.

3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Experiments  were  done  on  two  types  of  magnets:  composite  solenoid  with  symmetry  axis
along the  z  axis and Helmholtz coils system designed to compensate Earth’s magnetic field (coils
lay  in  horizontal  plane).  Sizes  of  composite  solenoid  (two  conjugated  coaxial  coils)  were:  inner
diameter of coil windings was 25mm, external diameter - 31.2mm, length of each winding - 29mm,
gap  between them  - 4mm, number  of wraps in each  winding  -  1121.  Helmholtz  coils  sizes  were:
diameter of each thin wrap was 900mm, distance between them - 460mm.

Each gravimetric measurement was a representation of interaction force between the sample
and  magnetic  field  by  scanning  of  z   axis.  Currents  in  solenoids  and  coils  were  selected  to  have
such  a  value  that  the  measured  values  lay  in  operating  range  of  STP  with  optimal  range  of
sensitivity. In case of composite solenoid this current was  I =200mA, for Helmholtz coils  I =3.1A.
Since both systems consist of two  separated coils, the  measurements  were done for parallel  and
antiparallel currents. Fig. 2 represents the primary experimental results for composite solenoid for
parallel (curve A) and antiparallel (B) currents respectively. Vertical axis represents the interaction
force  in  mN.  The  scanning  speed  was  0.113mm/sec.  A  steel-3  ring    with  inner  diameter  3mm,
external diameter 13mm and thickness 6.4mm was used as a sample. Signals at going in and out
of  the  solenoid  were  coincide  in  satisfactory  level  (null  signals  with  switched  off  currents  are
omitted).  The  width  of  experimental  track  is  about  0.1mN  and  is  greater  than  the  resolution  of
string tension pickup and is mainly caused by swinging of rather big sample in the narrow hole of

coils during the scanning. Division of

Obtained experimental results were processed to define the magnetic field gradients. To find
  for  samples  with  magnetic
it  actually  one  have  to  find  the  factor  (
  or  magnetic  moment  M z   for  samples  from  permanent  magnet.  In  principle,  one
susceptibility 
can  estimate  these  parameters  using  the  tabulated  values  of  known  materials  in  use,  however,
since  these  factors  depend  on  the  samples  shape,  finding  of  these  parameters  using  special
calibrating  measurements  by  Hall  detectors  seemed  preferable.  Note  that  measurements  done
near the experimental points of field gradient are sufficient.

There  are  two  way  to  compare  the  gravimetric  measurements  with  Hall’s  detectors  ones:
integrate  gravimetric  curves  or  differentiate  Hall  detectors  ones.  Taking  into  account  that  during
each period of measurement the current trough coils was switched off, the numerical differentiation
is preferable, because it uses information of local sections of experimental curves.

To  calibrate  measurements  of  composite  solenoid  the  experimental  results  for  antiparallel
currents were used. Calculation of gradient of magnetic field square using experimental points for
composite  solenoid  was  done  by  numerical  approximation  of  seven  groups  of  currents  switching
on.  Results  were  compared  with  gravimetric  measurements  and  are  presented  in  Fig.  6.  Such  a

Similar calculations  of the field gradient for the Helmholtz coils system using Hall’s detector
measurements are presented in Fig. 7. In this case comparison with the gravimetric measurements
defines  the  samples  magnetic  moment  of  the  order  of  1.35  (Gs/cm)/mN  with  correlation  factor
95%.

In further experiments with the same samples Hall measurements obviously are not needed.

5. CONCLUSION

This  work  was  aimed  to  develop  and  construct  a  complete  system  of  measurements,
although the measurements were done on demonstration samples. Varying of temperature both to
the high and low temperatures are possible and will essentially broaden unit’s possibilities.

Combination of these measurements with other methods of measurement of magnetic field
characteristics gives a possibility to fulfil sufficiently simple and precise measurements of magnetic
parameters.

This work was fulfilled by support of firm HTM Reetz (Berlin), and authors are thankful to the

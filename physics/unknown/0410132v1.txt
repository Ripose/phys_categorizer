oC  are  investigated  by  a  novel 

approach. For 1480 nm pumping regime, it is seen that the saturated signal power increases 

more quickly than that of 980 nm pumping regime, with the increasing temperature. The 

variation  in  the  saturated  signal  power  with  temperature  is  nearly  constant  at  980  nm 

pumping  regime.  In  addition,  the  population  inversion  with  respect  to  the  increasing 

normalized signal power is examined and it is seen that it is independent of temperature for 

980 nm but it strongly depends on temperature for 1480 nm especially at lower normalized

1. Introduction 

Erbium-doped  fiber  amplifiers  (EDFAs)  operating  in  the  saturated  signal  power  (SSP)  regime 

have been widely used in optical networks and optical communication systems due to their low 

crosstalk  and  low  noise  figure  (Sun  et  al.  1997;  Dai  et  al.  1997).  The  performance  analysis  of 

these  amplifiers  depends  on  theoretical  model  to  be  used,  such  as  the  rate  or  the  propagation 

equations. In some works (Desurvire and Giles 1989; Horowitz et al. 1999), the saturation effect 

of a signal in EDFAs, operating at the signal wavelength of nearly 1530 nm, is only related to 

pump powers, but the temperature dependency is not included.  

     In this work, the temperature dependency of the saturated signal power for both 980 nm and 

1480 nm pumping wavelengths is investigated at the temperature range from -20 to 60  oC. An 

expression  relating  the  relative  population  difference  to  the  signal  power  normalized  by  the 

saturated signal power is also derived.

12σ   is  the  signal  absorption 

cross  section  between  first  and  second  (intermediate)  levels,  h 12ν   is  the  photon  energy  for  the

 transition,  Γ  is the mode overlap or the confinement factor at signal wavelength 

12

12

12A

  is  the  effective  cross-sectional  area  of  the  fiber  core.  980  nm  pumping  regime  is 

treated  as  a  three-level  amplification  system  but  1480  nm  pumping  regime  is  considered  as  a 

two-level amplification system. According to the modified rate equation model (Berkdemir and 

Özsoy 2004a), for 980 nm pumping regime, the population of third level, N

3, is nearly equal to 

zero and thus the total population N consists of Er3+-ions in the remaining levels, i.e. N= N1+ N2.

But,  for  the  1480  nm  pumping  regime,  the  population  of  the  second  level  is  supposed  to  take 

form 

N

,  where  the  sublevel  populations

and

22N

  are  filled  with  Er

3+-ions 

coming from the ground state via the absorbed signal and pump powers, respectively, as shown 

in Fig.1.  

Figure 1. 

 

 

 

     The  population  distribution  of  Er3+-ions  between  the  two-sublevels  within  the

  energy

state  is  governed  by  the  Boltzmann’s  distribution,  for  maintaining  a  constant  population  at  the 

thermal  equilibrium.  The  thermalization  process  occurring  between  sublevels  is  represented  by 

the  nonradiative  rates 

  (transition  to  the  upper  sublevel)  and 

  (transition  to  the  lower

sublevel).  Thus,  under  the  conditions  of  overall  thermal  equilibrium,  we  have  the  well-known 

relation

population of the two-level system can be written as

. In this study, for the 

two-level  amplification  system,  it  is  assumed  that  the 

  parameter  takes  different  values  for 

β

different temperatures and a value of 200 cm-1 is used for the energy interval 

2E∆  between 

22N

 

and 

N

21

 at the temperature range from -20 to 60 

oC. 

     Based  on  the  above  arguments,  the  rate  equations  are  modified  for  three  and  two  level 

amplification systems, which represent EDFAs pumped by 980 nm and 1480 nm, respectively, 

and the relations for the relative population difference are given as (Berkdemir and Özsoy 2004a, 

Berkdemir and Özsoy 2004b):

investigate  how  the  saturated  signal  power  changes  with  the  launched  pump  power  in  the 

temperature range from -20 to 60 oC.  

     By  considering  the  system  has  three  levels  for  all  pumping  wavelengths  (Iizuka  2002),  the 

relative population difference in terms of the saturated signal power is given as below:

In the case of pumping at 980 nm, for a large normalized pump power, the maximum obtainable 

relative  population  difference  is  1  from  (2a),  but  from  (2b)  for  1480  nm  it  changes  with  the 

parameter  β.  Under  the  assumption  that  number  of  levels  is  different  for  different  pump 

wavelengths, the following relations are obtained by considering (3) and (4).

3. Results and Discussion 

For the saturated signal power calculations, we used the values in Table 1 for 980 nm pumping 

regime  and  those  in  Table  2  for  1480  nm.  The  calculated  values  of 

  for  980  nm  pumping 

η

5

 

 

 

regime at    -20, 20 and 60 oC are 1.110, 1.095 and 1.084, respectively. The values of 

η

 and 

β

 

for  1480  nm  at  these  temperatures  are  obtained  as  1.217,  1.185,  1.161  and  0.33,  0.38,  0.43, 

respectively.  

Table 1.   

Table 2.   

Figure 3. 

 

 

 

 

     In the case of 980 nm pumping regime, Fig.2 shows the saturated signal power as a function 

of launched pump power at the temperature values of – 20, 20 and 60 oC. This figure shows that 

the  saturated  signal  power  is  proportional  to  not  only  the  pump  power  but  also  to  the 

temperature.  If  the  temperature  is  increased  from  –  20  to  60  oC,  the  saturated  signal  powers 

increase almost the same amount for all the launched pump powers, and it can be seen that its 

temperature dependency is almost linear.    

     Fig.3, which is for 1480 nm pumping regime, shows a different behavior than those of Fig.2,  

i.e., slops of the curves are not equal and higher for increasing temperatures. This difference is 

due  to  β  and  hence  due  to  the  temperature  dependency  of  saturated  signal  power.  The 

dependence of the saturated signal power on temperature is again almost linear. 

     The relative population difference versus the normalized signal power is plotted in Fig.4 for 

both pumping regimes. The uppermost curve is related to (4), which assumes that the system has 

three  levels  for  all  wavelengths,  the  next  curve  belongs  to  980  nm  pumping,  for  all  of  the 

temperatures, and the other curves are connected with 1480 nm pumping for the temperatures of 

6

–  20,  20  and  60  oC,  respectively.  It  is  seen  from  all  the  curves  that,  the  relative  population 

difference  gradually  decreases  when  the  saturated  signal  power  increases.  For  the  pumping  at 

1480  nm,  an  increase  in  the  temperature  results  in  a  decrease  in  the  relative  population 

difference, especially at lower normalized signal powers, but at 980 nm, it is not influenced from 

the temperature changes.  

Figure 4. 

4. Conclusion 

We  have  used  a  new  approach  to  describe  the  temperature  dependency  of  the  saturated  signal 

power for EDFAs operated at 980 nm and 1480 nm pumping regimes, and analyzed the results 

for  the  temperature  range  from  –  20  to  60  oC.  The  expressions  for  the  relative  population 

difference have also been derived in terms of the parameters including the temperature and the 

saturated  signal  power  for  both  pumping  regimes.  In  this  approach  the  main  point  is  that  the 

saturated signal power is connected not only to the pumping powers but also to the temperature.  

It is seen that, for 1480 nm pumping regime the saturated signal power more quickly increases 

than that of 980 nm pumping regime, with the increasing temperature. On the other hand, at 980 

nm pumping regime, the variation of saturated signal power is nearly constant for all the pump 

powers  within  the  temperature  range.  Furthermore,  the  population  inversion  with  respect  to 

normalized signal power is almost independent of temperature for 980 nm but it strongly depends 

on temperature and increases with decreasing temperature for 1480 nm pumping.

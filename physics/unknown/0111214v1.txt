Abstract 

Recently,  interest  has  grown  for  application  of 
reconfigurable  devices  in  robust  and  adaptive  control 
systems. The main advantage of  such devices is that its 
structure is not fixed and may be varied depending on 
the  currently  used  control  algorithm.  In  this  paper  a 
new  PC-based  reconfigurable  microcontrollers  (RMC) 
are  offered  for  Experimental  Physics  control  systems. 
Programmable  logic  devices  (PLD)  XILINX  Inc.  of  a 
type  FPGA  are  used  in  RMC.  Reconfigurable  devices 
are  connected  to  PC  as  the  coprocessor  through  the 
system bus (for example, PCI) forming the system with 
programmable  architecture  as  a  result.  Each  control 
algorithm  is  realized  as  a  file  of  a  PLD-configuration. 
The set of model- based control algorithms make up the 
functional  library.  Model  selection  procedure  on  the 
base of control relevant identification is a part of united 
control  system  design.  Methodology  of  the  joint  and 
iterative  identification  and  control  is  proposed  which 
well  suited  for  the  realization  in  RMC  and convenient 
for  users.  Control  design  is  arranged  as  follows.  First 
is  carried  out  and 
the 
approximate  model  is  reconstructed  using  special 
identification  algorithm  and  model  structure 
in 
normalized  form.  Then  select  from  the  library  the 
appropriate liner or nonlinear parametrized control law. 
After  that  the  parametric  class  of  controllers  which 
guarantee  stability  of  the  closed  loop  system  is 
automatically determined. The best robust controller in 
given class is obtained by parameter tuning procedure, 
which  give  opportunity  to  impact  performance  of  the 
transient  processes  in  closed  system  without  loosing 
asymptotic stability.

1 INTRODUCTION 
The  microcontrollers  are  applied  in  modern  control 
system’s  of  technological  processes,  instrumentation, 
robots  -  manipulators,  physical  and  other  systems  of 
real time, intended for to execution of the large sizes of 
calculations.  They  are  realized,  as  a  rule, or as sets of 
modules,  which  are  built  in  the  computer  or  as 
standalone  control 
the  equipment, 
technological  processes  etc.  For  record  of  the  control 
algorithm  to  the  memory  can  be  used  ROM  (the

reconfigurable  and  programmable  microcontrollers  is 
that their structure is not fixed and varies depending on 
the  control  algorithm.  Thus 
the  computational

2 REALIZATION OF SET-VALUED 
CONTROL SYSTEM 
Offered  RMC  is  a  new  approach  to  construction  of 
control  system  of  experimental  physical  plants.  This 
approach allows for multiple implementation to change 
both  the  parameters  and  structure,  laws  and  strategies 
of control. It is especially important for physical plants 
when  the  conditions  of  experiment,  targets  and  the 
tasks  are  varied.  It  is  desirable  for  the  experimenters 
and  operators  working  with 
the  system,  without 
substitution of the equipment, to change algorithms and 
target  of  control,  not  breaking  thus  of  stability  and 
other important dynamic parameters of the system. 

The  system  consists  of  standard  hardware  and 
reconfigurable  coprocessors  on  base  FPGA  type  PLD 
and  set  of  programs  realizing  algorithms  of  iterated 
identification  of  an 
synthesis  of  control  with 
the  well-
approximating  model.  The  creation  of 
structured 
structural 
library  of  algorithms  and 
implementations, appropriate to them stored as files of 

configurations,  is  supposed.  The  task  of  synthesis  in 
this  case  consists 
in  a  choice  of  optimal  pair 
(algorithm-structure)  for  concrete  source  experimental 
data.  Thus,  the  task  of  optimal  synthesis  is  reduced  to 
the  task  of  an  optimal  choice  on  previously  generated 
(and  constantly  extended)  set  of  solutions.  Distinctive 
feature  of  the  offered  controller  is  the  possibility  of 
creation  of  two-level  nonlinear  stabilization  system, in 
which  the  lower  automatic  level  provides  stability and 
robustness of the close-looped system, and the top level 
allows  to  the  engineer  flexibly  to  operate  quality  of 
regulation. 

The information for synthesis is measuring responses 
of  the  system  on  inputs.  It  is  supposed  also  that  the 
input  and  output  information  can  be  entered  in  PC 
using converters (analogue / digit and digit / analogue). 

3 RECONFIGURABLE STRUCTURES 
Usually  structures  of  reconfigurable  devices  contain 
one  or  several  chips  PLD,  memory  for  storage  a 
configuration  files  (PROM  or  FLASH-memory),  port 
of testing / debugging JTAG IEEE Std. 1149.1, SRAM 
or  DRAM-memory 
for  caching  data,  plug  and 
controller  for  connection  to  buses  ISA,  PCI  (for 
modules-coprocessors),  plugs 
for  connection  of 
peripherals  etc.  The  configuration  file  can  be  written 
down in ROM and automatically (at power up) to boot 
in  a  chip  PLD.  In  the  other  mode  a  configuration  file 
loads in a chip PLD from RAM of the computer. 

The  process  of  designing  of  PLD-based  devices  is 
completely  supported  by  tools  CAD,  for  example, 
Foundation Series of the Xilinx Corporation. Structure 
Foundation  Series  includes  the  library  of  parametric 
modules  [2],  which  supports  functional  solutions  in  a 
range from small blocks (adders, registers, multipliers) 
up  to  larger  blocks  (correlators,  DFT-  32,  64  and  128 
points,  FFT  -  1024  points).  The  possibility  of 
reconfiguration  allows  to  make  modifications  of  a 
for 
working  product  or 
implementation of the various control algorithms taking 
into  account  the  specific  features  of  hardware.  The 
architecture  of  chips  of  series  Virtex  is  completely 
(Internet 
compatible  with 
Reconfigurable  Logic).  Technology  IRL  gives  the 
possibility  of  remote  dynamic  reconfiguration  through 
the  Internet  [3],  and  also  share  development  of 
standalone system or chips through Internet by various 
workgroups.

characteristics of the controlled object, this process can 
be  carried  out  by  an  interactive  way  with  restoring  in 
identification  experiment  only  of  that  part  of  a  model, 
which  we  are  going  to  change  with  the  help  of 
feedback.  For  an  obtained  submodel  in  the  class  of 
results  guaranteeing  stability  and  other 
important 
properties  of  transients,  for  example,  robustness,  the 
interactive way selects best feedback from the point of 
view  of 
the  experimenter.  Thus  can  vary  both 
parameters, and structure of feedback. If the result does 
not  satisfy  the  experimenter,  then  identification  of  the 
system  is  repeated,  but  already  for  the  close-looped 
system.  Thus  a  submodel  is  identified  again  and 
parameters  will  be  improved  with  the  help  of  new 
feedback.  The  iterative  process  can  proceed  while 
obtaining desirable result.

For such iterative procedure of control synthesis was 
converging 
the  developed 
methodology the following two ways are used. The first 
one concerns to a choice of structure of an identifying 
model,  which  accepts  splitting  it  on  standalone  blocks 
or subsystems. Usually it is canonical or normal forms 
of representation of the equations describing the system 
dynamic.  The  equivalent  representation  can  be  written 
down for discrete analogue of this dynamic system. 

 
realization  of  the  control  system  with  PLD-based

algorithms.  Further  on  the  base  of  this  system  and

RMC  can  be  used  autonomously,  irrespective  of  the 
computer. Additional logical resources in this case are 
released  at the expense of absence of the controller of 
the external bus.

Customization  of  structure  for  realization  of  chosen

chip  at  a  gate  level  allow  to  increase  speed  of  the 
system  in  comparison  with  program  solutions  and  to

specialized hardware. 

The  work  of  the  experimenter  with  the  offered 
control system does not require a special knowledge of 
the  control  synthesis  and  all  operation  is  reduced  to 
simple 
and 
recommendations applied to the system.

In  the  close-looped  system  the  eigenvalues  of  the 
matrix corresponding to only subsystem are varied. All 
other  roots  of  the  characteristic  equation  are  saved. 
Therefore  second  way  of  the  developed  methodology 
consists  in  estimation of considered submodel on base 
output  of  a  current  state.  The  estimation  method 
advanced  in  [4]  with  use  of  observation  results  on  a 
finite sliding interval is applied for this purpose.

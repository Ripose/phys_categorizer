Abstract:  Single-shot 
time  resolved  Coherent  Anti-Stokes  Raman 
Scattering (CARS) is presented as a viable method for fast measurements of 
molecular  spectra.  The  method  is  based  on  the  short  spatial  extension  of 
femtosecond pulses and maps time delays between pulses onto the region of 
intersection  between  broad  beams.  The  image  of  the  emitted  CARS  signal 
contains  full  temporal  information  on  the  field-free  molecular  dynamics, 
from  which  spectral  information  is  extracted.  The  method  is  demonstrated 
on liquid samples of CHBr3 and CHCl3 and the Raman spectrum of the low-
lying vibrational states of these molecules is measured.

Femtosecond  nonlinear  optical  spectroscopy  has  emerged  as  a  powerful  tool  for  tracing 
intramolecular  processes  as  they  occur.  The  ability  to  excite  and  probe  molecules  on  time 
scales  faster  than  their  rotational  and  vibrational  motion  opened  up  new  directions  in  the 
analysis  of  structure  as  well  as  dynamics  of  intramolecular  processes.  In  analogy  to  NMR, 
optical two- dimensional (2D) spectroscopic methods have been introduced which are geared 
towards the retrieval of couplings between different degrees of freedom of molecules [1]. In 
these  experiments,  ultrashort  pulses  were  used  to  study  vibrational  as  well  as  electronic 
degrees  of  freedom  either  by  direct  (IR)  or  Raman  type  excitation  and  probing  [2-10]. 
Coupling  between  degrees  of  freedom  is  expressed  as  correlations  between  different 
excitations  of  molecular  states.    Since  the  molecular  response  has  to  be  probed  before 
dephasing  occurs,  most  experiments  are  performed  in  the  time  domain.  Thus,  one  usually 
changes  the  timing  (or  in  some  cases  the  spectral  contents)  of  the  exciting  pulses,  and  the 
probing is usually done by scanning the delay between the excitation and the probe pulse. The 
two time delays provide access to the two relevant spectroscopic dimensions.  

 In  Time  Delayed  CARS  (TDCARS),  the  first  two  pulses  (pump  and  Stokes) 
establish coherence between vibrational states of a molecule, and a third, delayed, probe pulse 
is  scattered  off  this  coherence.  In  resonant  CARS  experiments,  an  additional  delay  between 
the  pump  and  Stokes  pulses  enables  evolution  of  the  prepared  wavepacket  on  the  excited 
electronic state potential surface [11], allowing selectivity in the preparation of ground state 
molecular  vibrational  states  and  providing,  in  fact,  a  two-dimensional  picture  of  correlation 
between ground and excite electronic states’ vibrational wavepackets [12].   

Most time domain 2D experiments require scanning of at least two delays, leading to 
long  measurement  times,  and  imposing  severe  (sometime  prohibitive)  requirements  on  laser 
system and molecular long term stability.   In the present communication we demonstrate an 
experimental  technique  that  enables  single-shot  measurements  of  time  resolved  CARS  by  a 
one-to-one mapping of delay times to spatial coordinates in the intersection region of the three 
input beams.  In this technique, various delay time combinations are realized all together, and 
as demonstrated, the entire measurement is performed in a single shot, enabling the tracking 
of intramolecular dynamics and coupling between different degrees of freedom. 
Single-shot  CARS  was  implemented  many  years  ago,  with  long  (nanosecond)  pulses,    for 
spatial  and  spectroscopic  characterization  of  gas  jets  [13]  or  of  laser  produced  plasmas  [14, 
15].  With  femtosecond  pulses  the  “spatial  extent”  of  a  pulse  may  be  much  shorter  than  the 

 

1

lateral  dimensions  of  the  laser  beam,  opening  possibilities  for  using  the  arrival  time  of  the 
pulses to a specific point in space for temporal resolution of the nonlinear optical signal.  

Encoding the interpulse delay on the spatial axes of the beams’ intersection area have 
been  pioneered  (in  picosecond  pump-probe  experiments)  by  Malley  and  Rentzepis  [16]. 
Various  beam  intersection  geometries  were  used  for  pulse  diagnostics  [17],  and  analyzed 
extensively by Fourkas et al. [18]   Other single-shot arrangements were based on pump-probe 
measurements  with  white  light  continuum  [19].    Zamith  et  al.  [20]  used  the  instantaneous 
frequency  of  a  chirped  pulse  to  map  frequency  to  time  delays  in  pump  probe  experiments.  
Recently Pouline and Nelson [21] have demonstrated encoding of interpulse delay on different 
propagation  directions  of  a  focused  beam.  DeCamp  and  Tokmakoff  [22]  utilized  the    broad 
bandwidth  of  an  ultrashort  pulse  to  map  spectral  (rather  than  temporal)  resolution  on  the 
spatial dimensions of a sample.     

In  this  work,  we  demonstrate  experimentally  that  coherent  field-free  evolution  of 
vibrational  wavepackets  can  be  captured  and  retrieved  by  the  spatial  imaging  of  a  CARS 
signal produced by laser pulses that are spatially shorter than the lateral dimensions of their 
beams. Consider a Degenerate Four Wave Mixing experiment in a three-dimensional Folded 
Boxcars configuration[23].  Three input beams pass through three corners of a square, and the 
signal beam is emitted toward the fourth corner due to phase matching conditions (Figure 1).

The geometrical axes are defined as follows: the x-axis lies along the bisector between beams

If the fundamental beams are not in resonance with electronic transitions of the molecule, the 
signal  will  be  observed  only  if  two  pulses  (pump  and  Stokes)  arrive  simultaneously  to 
establish coherence in the sample, to be probed later by the delayed third pulse. Due to phase 
matching  considerations,  the Stokes  pulse  should be provided by  beam  2, while  each of  the 
two other pulses can serve either as pump or as probe. Therefore, we expect the picture to be 
symmetric with respect to the x-z plane at y = 0 (Figure 2).  

Right of center, (the +y direction) pulse 3 precedes pulse 1, and thus should serve as 
a pump, and similarly, left of center (the –y direction) pulse 1 serves as a pump. According to 
y= − , and pulses 2 and 1 
equations (2) pulses 2 and 3 temporally coincide along the line z
arrive simultaneously to points along the line z
y= . Thus, in the present arrangement, signals 
may be observed in two regions, as depicted by the time flow diagrams below the figure: right 
y= −  line (pumped by pulse 3 and probed by pulse 1), and left 
and below center, along the  z
and  below  center  along  the  z
y=   line  (pumped  by  pulse  1  and  probed  by  pulse  3).  At 
nominally zero delay, the coherence peak appears at y=z=0 and the region above it (z>0) does 
not contain any signal, because in this region the probe precedes the excitation pair.  
 

Figure  2  schematic  y-z  slice  of  the  interaction  region.    The  outer  rectangle 
represents  the  intersection  between  the  k1  and  k3  beams.  The  large  gray  circle 
represents  beam  k2    The  inner  black  circle  depicts  region  where  all  three  pulses 
coincide  and  DFWM  signal  is  produced.  Dashed  and  dotted  lines  represent 
coincidence between pulses 2 and 3 and pulses 2 and 1 respectively.  Gray ellipses 
represent time delayed vibrational signal.  The four pulse sequence schemes depict 
order of arrival of the pulses in each quadrant of the interaction volume. 

 

 
All  points  in  the  interaction  region  emit  the  FWM  signal  in  the  same,  phase  matched, 
direction, and the camera collects the entire spatially resolved CARS signal. The interpretation 
of the image requires calibration of the spatial coordinates in terms of angles and time delays

between  the  pulses.  A  convenient  method  for  calibrating  the  time–to-space  mapping  is  to 
introduce  external,  known  delays  to  the  individual  beams  and  observe  the  ‘motion’  (in  the 
image plane) of the coherence peak as a function of these external delays. The coherence peak 
is  significantly  stronger  than  the  time  delayed  signals  and  is  very  easy  to  observe  due  to 
various contributions to the nonlinear susceptibility.   Once the image plane is calibrated, it is 
possible  to  move  the  coherence  peak  out  of  the  picture  by  delaying  the  probe  beam,  thus 
enabling  full  utilization  of  the  dynamic  range  of  the  camera.  Moving  the  coherence  peak 
breaks the symmetry between right and left, and in our experiments, the signal was collected 
along the calibrated  z
y= −  axis of the image (the sample is pumped by k3, dumped by k2, 
and probed by k1).    
A  closely  related  configuration  has  been  discussed  by  Naumov  et  al.[24,  25]  who  had 
theoretically  analyzed  configurations  involving  chirped  pulses  in  a  three  dimensional  beam 
crossing  geometry,  which  allow  for  spatial  mapping  of  different  spectral  components  of  the 
CARS signal. The proposed mapping transformation is based on the dispersion of the arrival 
time  of  different  frequency  components  of  linearly  chirped  pulses  due  to  group  velocity 
variations.  
 
To  demonstrate  the  method,  we  measured  the  spectra  of  the  low-lying  vibrational 
modes of bromoform (CHBr3) and chloroform (CHCl3).  The measurements were performed 
on neat liquids in a 5 cm long quartz cell. The laser pulses were derived from a chirped pulse 
amplifier system providing pulses centered around 800 nm, ~70 fsec long, and of total energy 
up  to  500  microJoul  per  pulse.    In  our  three  dimensional  phase  matching  arrangement,  the 
crossing angles were 2.3° and the beams’ diameter at the crossing was  ~5 mm.    
To demonstrate the capabilities of the method, Figure 3a. depicts the image captured from a 
single pulse (no averaging).  The dashed line is the calibrated  z
y= −  axis of the image (see 
above).  The  signal  was  measured  along  50  parallel  lines  in  the  central  region,  covering  the 
pulse duration, digitized and averaged for each value of the pump-probe delay.   The inset of 
Figure 3b depicts the time domain signal  and its power spectrum.

line. The upper axis depicts the τ3,1 delay (pump-probe delay) (a). Power spectrum of the averaged time-
domain signal. The time-domain signal is depicted in the inset (b).  

 
The  power  spectrum  shows  the  peaks  at  152  cm-1  and  224  cm-1  corresponding  to  the 
asymmetric and symmetric bending of C-Br bonds respectively [26]. The third peak at 68 cm-1 
corresponds to the beat frequency between these two modes.  The relatively weaker amplitude 
of  the  fundamental  peaks  stems  from  the  limited  bandwidth  of  the  exciting  pulses,  and  a 
( )3χ , to be discussed 

detailed analysis of the terms contributing to the nonlinear susceptibility
in the future.

picture  is  an  average  over  2000  pulses.  Figure  4a  depicts  the  spatial  image,  and  Figure  4b 
shows the time domain signal and the corresponding power spectrum. The observed peaks at 
263  cm-1  and  364  cm-1  are  assigned  to  asymmetric  and  symmetric  bending  of  the  C-Cl 
bonds[26].  The  intensity  of  the  364  peak  is  weak  due  to  the  limited  bandwidth  of  the 
fundamental pulses. The difference frequency homodyne peak is observed at 101 cm-1.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new approach to single-shot time-resolved CARS. The 
method is simple to operate and enables the direct monitoring of several picoseconds of field-
free vibrational evolution in one single image. The method was demonstrated on bromoform 
and chloroform, where the CARS spectrum of the low lying vibrational modes was measured. 
The ability to simultaneously measure both pump-Stokes and pump-probe delay times opens 
up  the  way  to  two-  dimensional  measurement  of  the  coupling  between  ground  and 
electronically  excited  states.    Future  development  of  this  spectroscopic  method  involves  the 
use  of  temporally  and  spectrally  shaped  pulses  for  selective  excitation,  as  well  as  spatial 
filtering  of  the  signal  for  selective  detection  of  particular  molecular  degrees  of  freedom. 
Experiments are under way to explore these possibilities.

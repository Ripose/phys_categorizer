A  self-consistent  1-D  model  was  developed  to  study  the  effects  of  non-local  electron  conductivity  on  power 
absorption  and  plasma  density  profiles  in  a  planar  inductively  coupled  argon  discharge  at  low  pressures  (≤  10 
mTorr).  The  model  consisted  of  three  modules:  (1)  an  electron  energy  distribution  function  (EEDF)  module  to 
compute  the  non-Maxwellian  EEDF,  (2)  a  non-local  electron  kinetics  module  to  predict  the  non-local  electron 
conductivity, RF  current, electric field  and power deposition profiles in the non-uniform plasma, and (3) a heavy 
species transport module to solve for the ion density and velocity profiles as well as the metastable density. Results 
using  the  non-local  electron  conductivity  model  were  compared  with  predictions  of  a  local  theory  (Ohm(cid:146)s  law), 
under  otherwise  identical  conditions.  The  RF  current,  electric  field,  and  power  deposition  profiles  were  very 
different,  especially  at  1  mTorr  for  which  the  effective  electron  mean  free  path  was  larger  than  the  skin  depth. 
However, the plasma density profiles were almost identical (within 10%) for the same total power deposition in the 
plasma. This result suggests that, for computing plasma density profiles, a local conductivity model (Ohm(cid:146)s law), 
with much reduced computational expense, may be employed even in the non-local regime. 

 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 

Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) sources can produce a 
high-density, uniform plasma in a low pressure gas without 
the  need  for  external  magnetic  fields  [1,2,3,4,5].  Such 
sources  are  used  extensively  for  etching  and  deposition  of 
thin films in microelectronics manufacturing. 

At higher pressures (above ≈ 20 mTorr), electrons in an 
ICP discharge are heated by  collisional dissipation of  wave 
energy.  However,  both  experimental  and  theoretical  results 
in lower pressure discharges, indicate that power deposition 
involves a collisionless electron heating mechanism [6,7]. It 
has been suggested that in both planar [8] and solenoidal [4] 
ICP  discharges,  the  collisionless  heating  mechanism  is  a 
(cid:147)warm  plasma(cid:148)  effect  analogous  to  the  anomalous  skin 
effect in metals.  

The  anomalous  skin  effect  in  gas  discharges  was  first 
studied analytically by Weibel [9] for a semi-infinite plasma 
with  uniform  electron  density.  Further  analytical  work  was 
performed  for  a  non-uniform  density,  semi-infinite  plasma 
with  a  (cid:147)diffuse  boundary(cid:148)  by  Liberman  et  al.  [10],  and  for 
an infinite plasma  with a  (cid:147)diffuse boundary(cid:148) by Dikman et 
al.  [11].  Early  experimental  investigation  of  the  skin  effect 
was performed by Demirkhanov et al. [12] for a cylindrical 
(cid:147)ring(cid:148) discharge. 

The  anomalous  skin  effect  in  1-D  (slab  geometry) 
bounded  plasmas  has  been  studied 
theoretically  and 
experimentally  in  [13,14]  for  a  symmetric  power  source  (a 
current sheet on either side of the slab), and in [15,16] for an 
asymmetric  source.  An  interesting  effect  associated  with 
bounded  plasmas  is  the  possible  resonance  between  the 
wave  frequency  and  the  motion  of  electrons  bouncing 
between  the  walls.  This  can  lead  to  enhanced  heating 
[15,17,18].  However,  as  shown  in  Ref.  19,  if  the  electron 
elastic collision frequency is too small, heating can actually 
decrease.  Most  theoretical  results  reported  thus  far  for  a 

bounded  plasma  assume  a  uniform  density  plasma,  where 
the  electrostatic  potential  well  is  flat  in  the  plasma  and 
infinite at the wall (to simulate the existence of sheaths). In 
this  square  potential  well,  electrons  are  reflected  back  into 
the  plasma  only  at  the  discharge  walls.  In  a  realistic  non-
uniform  plasma,  however,  the  electron  turning  points  will 
depend  on  the  electron  total  (kinetic  plus  potential)  energy 
and  the  actual  shape  of  the  potential  well,  i.e.,  low  total 
energy electrons bounce back at locations within the plasma. 
Although theoretical treatments of non-uniform slab plasmas 
have been reported [10], detailed self-consistent simulations 
related  to  such  plasmas  are  lacking.  A  review  of  classical 
and  recent  works  on  the  anomalous  skin  effect  in  plasmas 
was made in [20]. 

The  present  article  presents  a  self-consistent  simulation 
of non-local electron kinetics and heavy species transport in 
a 1-D slab (bounded) non-uniform plasma with a symmetric 
power  source.  An  argon  discharge  is  studied  incorporating 
both  electron  impact  reactions  and  metastable  chemistry. 
Non-local  effects  on  both  power  deposition  and  plasma 
density  profiles  are  of  particular  interest.  It  is  shown  that 
non-local  behavior  strongly  influences  the  RF  field  and 
power  deposition  profiles  while  having  a  negligible  impact 
on plasma density profiles for the same total power.  

 
2.0 MODEL DESCRIPTION 
A schematic of a 1-D parallel plate symmetric discharge 
(plate  separation  L)  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Current  sheets  (not 
shown)  on  either  side  of  the  plasma,  driven  by  a  radio 
frequency  (RF)  source,  generate  a  transverse  RF  field  Ey 
heating the plasma electrons. The RF field amplitude at the 
plasma edges is E0; this value is set by the magnitude of the 
RF current and directly affects the total power deposited in 
the plasma. The RF field is attenuated by power transfer to 
the  plasma  electrons.  Most  of  the  power  is  deposited  near

the edge in what is called the (cid:147)skin layer.(cid:148) Predicting the RF 
field  and  power  deposition  profiles  with  account  of  the 
thermal motion of electrons in a self-consistent manner is an 
important part of this work.

RF  current  source  (not  shown)  results  in  an  RF  field  in  the 
transverse direction, Ey. The value of the  field at the edges, E0, is 
determined by the desired power deposition in the plasma. A space 
charge field Esc develops in the x-direction to confine electrons. 

* and x2

 
An  electrostatic  (space  charge)  field  Esc(x)  in  the  x-
direction  develops  to  confine  electrons  in  the  plasma  and 
equalize  the  electron  and  ion  current  to  the  walls.    The 
electron  potential  energy  ϕ(x)  corresponding  to  this  field  is 
shown  schematically  in  Fig.  2.  Electrons  with  sufficiently 
low  total  (x-kinetic  plus  potential)  energy  will  be  reflected 
* for an 
by this potential well. The reflection points x1
electron  with total energy  ε are shown in Fig. 2. Thus, low 
energy electrons are confined near the discharge center, but 
higher energy electrons can reach further towards the walls. 
The sheath  near the physical  boundaries  was  not accounted 
for explicitly. Because of the high plasma density the sheath 
is  only  100s  of  µm  thick.  Thus,  the  location  of  the  sheath 
edge is essentially at the physical boundary, and the plasma 
approximation  ni=ne  was  applied  to  the  whole  domain.  An 
infinite  potential  barrier  was  assumed  for  the  sheath. 
Electrons  with  total  energy  higher  than  the  potential  at  the 
sheath  edge  ϕsh  were  assumed  to  reflect  at  the  physical 
boundary, the underlying assumption being that the electron 
current to the wall was considered to be negligible.

Since non-local behavior is a warm plasma effect, kinetic 
treatment of electron transport is necessary. When electrons 
are  warm  enough  to  be  transported  out  of  the  (cid:147)skin  layer(cid:148) 
during  an  RF  cycle,  power  is  said  to  be  deposited  non-
locally.  In  a  sense,  the  current  at  a  given  location  is 
influenced by  the  field at all  other locations. In contrast, in 
the  local  case,  the  current  at  a  given  location  only  depends 
on  the  field  at  that  particular  point  (Ohm(cid:146)s  law).  Non-

applicable to a semi-infinite plasma. Nevertheless, it is used 
here even for a finite plasma slab to aid discussion of results.   
For pressures typically smaller than 10 mTorr for argon, 
the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) can be non-
Maxwellian  [21].  Hence,  for  accurate  calculation  of 
discharge  characteristics  at  low  pressures,  the  EEDF  needs 
to  be  computed  self-consistently.  The  following  section

describes  a  model  for  computing  the  EEDF  for  a  low 
pressure  argon  plasma  in  which  collisionless  electron 
heating can be dominant [22, 23]. Only a sketchy outline of 
the  model  is  given  here.  Details  are  left  for  another  paper 
[23].

Once the isotropic EEDF  0f  can be obtained by solving Eq.

compute the RF field profile in the discharge. 

 
2.3 Heavy Species Transport (HST) Module 

The  heavy  species  transport  module  solves  for  the  ion 
density  and  velocity  profiles  as  well  as  the  metastable 
species  density.  Since  the  extremely  thin  sheaths  were  not 
included  in  the  simulation,  the  quasi-neutrality  constraint 
was  imposed,  and  the  location  of  the  plasma-sheath 
boundary was taken to be essentially at the wall. The power 
deposition  in  the  plasma  is  implicitly  coupled  to  the  ion 
equation through ionization which depends on impact cross-
sections of electron-atom collisions and the EEDF. Since the 
drift-diffusion  approximation  for  ions  is  questionable  at 
pressures below about 10 mTorr, a momentum equation was 
solved to compute Ar+ velocity. The metastable Ar* species 
density is quite  uniform at pressure below about 10  mTorr. 
Hence  a  spatially  average  (0-D)  model  was  used  to 
determine  Ar*.  Due  to  symmetry,  only  half  the  domain 
(0≤x≤L/2) was considered. 

The continuity equation for Ar+ ions can be written as

3.0 METHOD OF SOLUTION 
 
A  modular  approach  was  adopted  in  order  to  solve  for 
the coupled EEDF, RF electric properties, and heavy species 
density  and  velocity  profiles,  in  a  self-consistent  manner. 
The  simulation  consisted  of  three  modules:  an  Electron 
Energy  Distribution  Function  (EEDF)  Module,  a  non-local 
electron  kinetics  (NLEK)  module  and  a  heavy  species 
transport  (HST)  module.  Figure  3  shows  the  interaction  of 
the  modules  and  the  type  of  information  exchanged  among 
them.  The  NLEK  module  computed 
the  non-local 
conductivity  kernel  G(x,x(cid:146))  (Eq.  12)  and  solved  for  the  RF 
electric  field  (Eq.  10)  and  current  density  (Eq.  9)  profiles 

given the peak electron density and the EEDF  0( )
f ε . The RF 
electric field at the wall E0 was adjusted to match the target 
total  power.  The  RF  field  profiles  were  then  used  in  the 
EEDF  module  to  compute  the  energy  diffusion  coefficient 
( )Dε ε  (Eq. 4) and solve for the distribution function  0( )
f ε  
(Eq. 3). The EEDF module provided the ionization (Eq. 23) 
and excitation rates, effective temperature  (
 profile (Eq. 

)effT

20), and potential profile (Eq. 21). The effective temperature 
was  used  in  the  ion  momentum  equation  (Eq.  22)  and  the 
boundary condition for ion velocity at the wall (Eq. 24). The 
ionization and excitation rates were used as source terms in 
the  continuity  equations  for  ions  and  metastables  (Eqs.  15 
and  25,  respectively).  The  HST  module  provided,  among 
other quantities, the ion (electron) density and potential φ as 
a  function  of  position.  These  were  fed  back  to  the  NLEK 
module to calculate a new RF field profile. The calculation 
was repeated until convergence to a self-consistent solution.

Figure  3:  Flow  diagram  used  for  numerical  simulation. 
Information exchanged between the modules is shown. Simulation 
cycled  between  the  three  modules  until  convergence.The  initial 
electron  density  profile  was  assumed  to  be  a  sine  function 
peaking  at  the  center  of  the  reactor.  The  corresponding 
potential  was  computed  assuming  a  uniform  Maxwellian 
temperature  of  2.5  V  using  Eq.  (21).  Convergence  was 
declared  when  the  potential  profile  changed  by  less  than 
0.1%  (in  the  L2  norm),  which  typically  took  about  30 
iterations among the modules. The L2 norm of the difference 
between  the  ion  (computed  by  Eq.  15)  and  electron 
(computed  by  the  EEDF,  Eq.  3)  density  profiles  was  less 
than 0.1% at convergence. 

In  the  NLEK  module,  Eq.  (10)  was  discretized  using 
second order central differencing for the left hand side. The 
integral  on  the  right  hand  side  was  found  using  the 
trapezoidal  rule  after  computing  the  conductivity  kernel

  was divided into the 
requisite number of cells. Ar+ density was computed at cell 
centers,  while  Ar+  velocity  and  flux  were  computed  at  the 
cell  edges.  A  first  order  upwind  scheme  was  used  to 
compute the mass and momentum flux of ions at cell edges, 
naturally preserving the property of information propagating 
only  outwards.  The  set  of  ordinary  differential/algebraic 
equations resulting after discretization of Eqs. (15), (22) and 
(25)  was  integrated  in  time  using  Backward  Difference 
Formulae  methods  [28]  until  a  steady  state  was  reached. 
Integration  was  performed  to  a  real  time  of  ~  10  ms  to 
ensure that metastables with the longest response time attain 
steady  state.  Calculations  on  a  933  MHz  Intel  Pentium  3 
Windows NT Workstation took about 10 hrs for a converged 
run  using  the  non-local  conductivity  (Eq.  9),  and  about  2 
mins  for  a  converged  run  using  the  local  conductivity 
(Ohm(cid:146)s law, Eq. 7). 

 

4.0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Base-case  parameter  values  used  in  the  simulation  are 
shown in Table II. Results in Figs. 4-9 are for a pressure of 1 
mTorr  and  discharge  frequency  of  13.56  MHz.  Results  in 
Figs.  10-15  are  for  a  pressure  of  10  mTorr  and  discharge 
frequency  of  13.56  MHz.  In  each  case,  profiles  calculated 
using the non-local electron kinetics module (solid lines) are 
compared  with  profiles  (dashed  lines)  obtained  using  the 
local approximation (Ohm(cid:146)s law)  under the same discharge 
conditions and for the same (integrated) total power. Values 
of  power  correspond  to  a  plate  cross  sectional  area  of  64π 
cm2.

a  pressure  of  1  mTorr,  the  electron-neutral  collision 
frequency  is  ν ~  3x106  s-1,  ν /ω~  0.05,  and  /
. 
As a result, the energy diffusion coefficient (Eq. 4) exhibits 
a  (cid:147)knee(cid:148)  at  ~  1  V,  indicating  that  the  (cid:147)temperature(cid:148)  of 
electrons  with  energies  less  than  1  V  is  significantly  lower 
than  that  of  electrons  with  energies  greater  than  1  V,  i.e., 
low  energy  electrons  are  not  heated  as  effectively.  Such  a 
knee  is  not  displayed  by  the  local  limit  of  the  energy 
diffusion coefficient. Consequently, the EEDFs for the local 
and non-local cases exhibit different behavior, especially for 
low  energies  and  also  for  energies  around  the  ionization 
threshold  (15.76  V).  Fig.  4  also  shows  a  higher  fraction  of 
electrons  just  beyond  the  ionization  threshold  for  the  non-
local  case.  The  non-local  and  local  models  predict  an 
effective temperature of ~ 6.5 V and ~ 5.5 V, respectively, 
for  electrons  near  the  discharge  edge.  This  implies  a 
difference  in  the  effective  electron  mean  free  path  near  the 
edge (where the RF field is highest), which in turn leads to 
considerably  different  field  and  current  density  profiles,  as 
discussed below.

At  1  mTorr,  the  electron-neutral  collision  frequency  is 
much  smaller  than  the  RF  frequency,  ν <<ω,  and  the

effective electron mean free path 
low  power  (50  W)  δ0  ~  3  cm,  which  is  larger  than  l,  and 
behavior  is  rather  local.  At  high  power  (200  W),  however, 
the  skin  depth  reduces  to  1.5  cm  suggesting  that  a  large 
fraction of electrons can contribute to the RF current outside 
the  skin  layer  (non-local  behavior).  This  is  clearly  seen  in 
Fig.  6,  which  shows  a  much  larger  current  density  at  the 
discharge  center  for  the  non-local  case  (the  normalization 
factor 
as

).  Also,  the  peak  in  current  density  is 
much more pronounced, and much lower currents exist near 
the  boundary 
this  case, 
contributions to the current near the boundary can only come 
from  electrons  with  energy  larger  than  the  sheath  edge

The  corresponding  power  deposition  profiles  are  shown 
in Fig. 7. The non-local model predicts drastically different 
power  deposition  profiles  compared  to  the  local  case.  The 
maximum  in  the  non-local  power  deposition  profile  is 
shifted away from the wall and, for higher powers, shows a 
pronounced feature near the center of the reactor. The local 
power deposition profile peaks near the wall and then decays 
monotonically  towards  the  discharge  center.  This  behavior 
can  be  explained  noting  that,  in  the  local  case,  the  phase 
difference  between  the  current  and  the  RF  field  is  constant

φ∆   is  not  constant.  In  fact,  high-energy  electrons  coming 
from  the discharge edge are  out of phase  with the  RF  field 
outside the skin  layer (close to the center), and lose energy 
to the field, leading to negative power deposition. Negative 
power  deposition  has  been  observed  experimentally  in  low

The  corresponding  positive  ion  density  profiles  are 
shown  in  Fig.  8.  The  positive  ion  density  is  determined  by 
production through ionization (e.g., Eq. 23), and loss at the 
boundary  (Eq.  24).  The  latter  depends  on  the  effective 
electron temperature at the boundary, Teff. The values of Teff 
at  the  boundary  for  the  non-local  and  local  cases  were 
significantly  different  (6.5  and  5.5  eV,  respectively)  as  the 
EEDFs differ considerably for energies below the ionization 
threshold  (see  Fig.  4).  Furthermore,  the  rate  of  ionization 
(which  depends  mainly  on  the  tail  of  the  distribution 
function  (
  V)  since  ground  state  ionization 
dominates)  was  found  to  be  marginally  higher  for  the  non-
local  EEDF.  These  two  trends  counterbalance  each  other 
resulting  in  comparable  ion  densities  for  the  non-local  and

electron  collisions  tend  to  thermalize  the  distribution, 
leading to an EEDF close to Maxwellian. In fact, electrons at 
the bulk and at the edge have an effective temperature of ~3 
V and ~3.5 V, respectively (weakly dependent on power). In 
contrast, for 1 mTorr, electrons at the bulk and edge have an 
effective  temperature  of  ~6.5  eV  and  ~2  eV,  respectively 
(for the non-local EEDF, see Fig. 4). 

Fig.  10  shows  the  profiles  of  the  amplitude  of  the  RF 
field as a function of position for total power of 50, 100 and 
200 W. The profiles are again normalized by the value of the 
field  at  the  edge.  A  transition  from  local  (monotonic  decay 
from  edge  to  center)  to  slightly  non-local  (non-monotonic 
decay) behavior is observed as power is increased. However, 
the effect of non-locality is  not pronounced at this pressure 
l δ <  for all powers. For example, at low power (50 
0/
as 
W) δ0 ~ 2.9 cm, larger than the effective electron mean free 
path  l  ~ 1.2 cm. Hence most electrons are confined within 
the  skin  layer,  and  the  local  approximation  is  valid.  As 
power  increases,  the  skin  depth  decreases  (becoming  ~  1.5 
cm  for  a  power  of  200  W),  while  the  effective  mean-free 
path  remains  approximately  constant.  This  causes  some 
energetic  electrons  to  escape  from  the  skin  layer  during  an 
RF cycle, resulting in slightly non-local behavior.

except  for  the  slight  negative  power  deposition  near  the 
discharge center for 200 W (for which non-local behavior is 
relatively more pronounced). The peak of power deposition 
occurs  closer  to  the  boundary,  well  within  the  skin  layer, 
when  compared  to  the  profiles  at  1  mTorr  (Fig.  7).  This 
suggests  that  energy  absorption  is  mainly  collisional.  If  the

The  corresponding  positive  ion  density  profiles  are 
shown in Fig. 13. When comparing the  non-local and local 
cases,  the  effective  electron  temperature  at  the  boundary  is 
very similar (3.5 V and 3.4 V, respectively) and the rate of 
ionization  is  also  similar  due  to  comparable  (cid:147)tails(cid:148)  of  the 
EEDF (Fig. 9). As a result, the ion densities for the non-local 
and local cases are very similar.

4.3  Comparison with experiments 
Figures  14-17  show  comparisons  between  experimental 
data  [30]  and  simulation  predictions  using  the  non-local 
(Figs. 14 and 16) and local (Figs. 15 and 17) models. The Ar 
ICP chamber was 19.8 cm in (inside) diameter and 10.5 cm 
in length. The coil current driving frequency was 6.78 MHz. 
The  model  described  in  Section  2  was  modified  to  handle 
this  asymmetric  discharge.  The  boundary  condition  for  the 
normalized  RF  field  was  set  to  zero  on  the  boundary 
opposite  the  coil  (metal  wall).  Eq.  (12)  was  also  modified, 
assuming a Maxwellian EEDF, with an electron temperature 
obtained experimentally [30]. The ion (electron) density was 
set 
the  value  measured  experimentally  [30].  The 
normalization  factor  E0  for  the  RF  field  at  the  wall  on  the 
coil-side was obtained by matching the simulated integrated 
power deposition with the experimental value of power. 

to 

Figs.  14a  and  14b  show  reasonable  agreement  between 
predicted (using the non-local model) and measured RF field 
and  current  density  profiles.  The  field  decreases  to  a 
minimum  and  then  goes  through  a  hump.  The  qualitative 
features  are  captured  with  the  model,  although  the  precise 
location of the minimum is not captured. This may be due to 
the fact that the actual discharge is 2-D, while the model is 
only 1-D. The predictions of the local model (Fig 15) are in 

serious discrepancy with the measurements. Table III shows 
skin  depths  predicted  by  the  local  and  non-local  models 
compared  with  the  experimental  values.  For  the  non-local 
model, the predicted skin depth is closer to the experimental 
values for higher powers. For the local model, the predicted 
skin depth deviates more at higher powers, due to increased 
non-locality  as  power  increases.  Clearly,  the  non-local 
model is in better agreement with measurements. 

Similar comparisons for 10 mTorr are shown in Figs. 16 
and  17.  The  non-local  model  again  does  a  better  job  in 
capturing the experimental profiles, although the local model 
is not as bad as it was for 1 mTorr. The local profiles in Figs. 
17a and 17b show reasonable agreement with experiment for 
low powers when non-locality is less prominent.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS  

 

11

A self-consistent 1-D model was developed to study the 
effects  of  non-local  electron  conductivity  on  power 
in  a  planar 
absorption  and  plasma  density  profiles 
inductively  coupled  argon  discharge  at  low  pressures  (≤  10 
mTorr).  The  model  consisted  of  three  modules:  (1)  an 
electron  energy  distribution  function  (EEDF)  module  to 
compute the non-Maxwellian EEDF, (2) a non-local electron 
kinetics  module 
the  non-local  electron 
conductivity, RF current, electric field and power deposition 
profiles in the non-uniform plasma, and (3) a heavy species 
transport  module  to  solve  for  the  ion  density  and  velocity 
profiles as well as the metastable density. The self-consistent 
simulation predicted the RF electric field, power deposition, 
electron  energy  distribution  function,  and  ion  density 
profiles.  Results  using  the  non-local  electron  conductivity 
model  were  compared  with  predictions  of  a  local  theory 
(Ohm(cid:146)s law), under otherwise identical conditions.

discharge  center.  This  difference  is  due  to  a  warm  plasma 
effect: high energy electrons originating from inside the skin 
layer  can  contribute  to  current  outside  the  skin  layer,  near 
the  discharge  center.  Since  these  electrons  can  be  out  of 
phase  with  the  RF  field,  negative  power  deposition  can  be 
observed  near  the  discharge  center,  especially  for  higher 
(more  non-locality).  Non-local  effects  were 
powers 
particularly  pronounced  at  1  mTorr,  for  which  the  electron 
collision  frequency  was  much  smaller  than  both  the 
discharge frequency and the bounce frequency. 

The EEDFs predicted by the local and non-local models 
were  found to be similar at 10  mTorr. At this pressure, the 
electron-neutral collision frequency is larger than the bounce 
frequency,  and  electron  heating  is  substantially  collisional. 
At a pressure of 1 mTorr, however, the EEDF predicted by 
the  non-local  model  revealed  that  electrons  with  energies 
greater  than  1  V  were  heated  more  efficiently,  when 
compared  to  the  local  case.  This  resulted  in  substantial 
differences  in  the  EEDFs  predicted  by  the  local  and  non-
local models.

Figure  17:  Comparison  between  experimental  data  [30]  and 
simulation predictions using a local model of RF electric field (a), 
and current density (b) profiles for a pressure of 10 mTorr. 

Although  the  RF  electric  field,  current,  and  power 
deposition  profiles  predicted  by  the  local  and  non-local 

models were drastically different (especially at 1 mTorr), the 
ion  (and  electron)  density  profiles  were  very  similar, 
differing  no  more  than  10%.  The  larger  ionization  rate 
predicted by the non-local EEDF, was counterbalanced by a 
larger effective temperature at the wall  (more ion escape by 
the Bohm flux), resulting in essentially identical ion density 
profiles.  This  finding  suggests  that,  for  the  prediction  of 
plasma density profiles, a local electron conductivity model 
(Ohm(cid:146)s law), which is computationally much faster, may be 
used even at very low pressures. 

The  above  comparison  between  non-local  and  local 
conductivity  models  was  made  for  the  actual  EEDF  as

determined  self-consistently.  A  separate  paper  [31]  reports 
the effect of the EEDF on discharge electrical properties and 
plasma density profiles. It is shown that the plasma density 
can differ by as much as 70% when a Maxwellian EEDF is 
used  instead  of  the  actual  EEDF  at  pressures  below  10 
mtorr.

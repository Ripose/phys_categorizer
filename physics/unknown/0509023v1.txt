ABSTRACT 

 
This article describes the most recent generation of full-custom analog integrated circuit that is intended for low-power, 
high-speed sampling of Radio-Frequency (RF) transients in excess of the Nyquist minimum.  A direct descendant of the 
Self-Triggered Recorder for Analog Waveforms (STRAW) architecture, and earlier variants of the LABRADOR (Large 
Analog  Bandwidth  Recorder  and  Digitizer  with  Ordered  Readout)  architecture,  this  design  is  distinguished  in  that 
readout speed is improved and dynamic range extended by providing direct digitization inside each storage cell.  While 
direct analog access to the stored values is lost, the simplifications gained by not transferring the small analog storage 
values result in operational ease.  In addition to the 8 RF channels, a 9th “timing” channel has been added to provide 
better system timing. A nominal conversion cycle requires 100µs, with an additional 50µs required for data transfer.

1. Introduction 

 
High  efficiency  acquisition  of  band-limited  impulsive  transients,  such  as  those  from  the  desired  Askaryan 
effect    [1]  neutrino  events,  requires  multiple  Giga-Sample/second  (GSa/s)  recording  in  excess  of  1  GHz  of 
analog  bandwidth.  An  integrated  circuit  capable  of  both  triggering  on  and  recording  of  such  signals  was 
proposed  [2]  in  conjunction  with  the  ANITA  project  [3].    In  the  process  of  developing  and  evaluating  the 
STRAW  [4]  architecture,  it  was  realized  that  operation  of  simultaneous  triggering  and  sampling  required 
significant  complexity,  without  significant  benefit.    This  is  due  in  part  to  resource  conflicts  in  the  design, 
which is 5-layer metal routing and Input-Output pin constrained.  By changing the emphasis of the STRAW 
architecture to be predominantly triggering, a split-off of the design could focus on optimizing sampling and 
digitization performance.   
 
 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

Staying within the same 100-pin Thin Quad Flat Pack (TQFP-100) packaging adopted for the STRAW series 
(motivated  by  economics  of  packaging  and  die  size),  a  natural  architecture  that  evolves  is  a  chip  with  8 
differential RF inputs and 12-bits of digitized data output.  In support of sampling and digitization, a number 
of  pins  are  added  which  allow  for  random  access  of  storage  cells.    The  benefits  and  difficulties  of  this 
architecture choice were explored in 2 previous generations of LABRADOR architecture.  All closely similar 
in design, the items specifically addressed in moving to a 3rd generation are the following: 
 

1. 

improved  dynamic  range:    by  providing  digitization  of  each  stored  sample  directly  within  each 
storage cell, there are a number of benefits: 

a.  decreased sensitivity to noise pick-up in transferring signals around the chip 
b.  extended linearity by not involving a transimpedance stage 
c.  shorter digitization time by making maximally parallel 
d.  simplified acquisition cycle, insensitive to analog cross-talk on readout buses 

 
2. 

improved wrap-around:  augmenting the nominal 256 storage cells are 4 cells of “tail catcher” to fill 
in the sampling details during the interval in which the write pointer is wrapping back around to the 
beginning of the array 

 
3.  front-end  termination  scheme:    allows  maintaining  a  proper  50Ω  stripline  across  the  chip,  while 

avoiding IR drop issues across the array. 

4.  addition  of  a  9th  channel:    provides  for  a  copy  of  the  system  timing  reference,  which  is  distributed 
globally  via  the  TURF  (for  ANITA)  and  can  be  interpolated  to  the  requisite  precision,  event-by-
event, to aid precise event timing reconstruction 

5. 

improved  power  supply  connections:    by  simplifying  the  control  requirements,  a  reduction  in  the 
number of control pins was attained.  These subsequently freed pins have been used to improve the 
power and ground contacts for the die. 

6.  simplified biasing:  by reducing the number of bias items required for manipulation of the transfer of 

analog signals, reduction in operational complexity is realized. 

2. Architecture 

 
At  the  top  of  Figure  1  is  found  a  block  diagram  of  the  LABRADOR/LABRADOR2  architecture;  at  the 
bottom  of  this  same  figure  the  LABRADOR3  architecture  is  shown  for  comparison.    As  seen,  the  key 
difference  is  the  simplification  of  not  moving  the  samples  to  an  array  of  ADCs.    Instead,  each  storage  cell 
contains an ADC.  Sampling of the RF inputs is obtained by a narrow write-pointer moving across a standard 
Switched  Capacitor  Array  (SCA)  arrangement,  the  principle  of  which  is  demonstrated  in  Figure  2,  and  the 
basics of this SCA sampling are described in detail elsewhere [5].

Figure 2:  A rough illustration of the Switched Capacitor Array (SCA) sampling upon which the LABRADOR 
design is based.  The write pointer circles endlessly, charging storage capacitors to the instantaneous bus voltage 
and holding the sampled value when the write pointer moves on, opening the switch. 

2.1.  Sampling Frequency 
 
Sampling  into  the  SCA  array  is  continuous,  with  the  values  held  and  subsequently  digitized  only  when  a 
trigger  signal  is  received.    In  doing  so,  a  drastic  reduction  in  the  required  power  for  sampling  is  achieved.  
Adjustment  of  the  sampling  rate  is  obtained  by  tuning  the  VDD  and  VSS  power  supply  rails  for  a  ripple 
oscillator chain, the sampling speed response for which may be seen in Figure 3.   This is in contrast to the 
STRAW  chip,  where  the  sampling  frequency  could  only  be  adjusted  by  varying  VDD.    As  a  result,  the 
sampling  frequency  may  be  adjusted  to  a  much  lower  value  and  positive-negative  transition  effects 
minimized.  For many applications, it is more convenient to set ROGND to ground, the response curve for 
which is shown in Figure 4.

1.25V (1.1V case shown).  The simplified case for ROGND grounded is illustrated in Figure 4.

Figure 4:  Sampling frequency for ROGND grounded, essentially reproducing sampling rates observed with the 
STRAW architecture. 

 
Upon receipt of a trigger, a readout cycle begins and consists of an ADC conversion cycle, described in Sub-
section 2.2 and a transfer cycle, described in Sub-section 2.3.  As noted in Figure 1, the on-chip ADCs can 
digitize all 9 x 260 samples (2,340) in parallel, which greatly speeds the analog to digital conversion process. 
Compared with the complexity of LABRADOR/LABRADOR2 analog transfer, digitization, and readout this 
simplified readout consists solely of one digitization cycle, followed by transfer of the signals out from the 
array as fast as possible.  
 

2.2.  ADC Conversion cycle 
 
A Wilkinson ADC makes use of a voltage ramp, a counter (Gray Code) and a comparator to convert a voltage 
into a count value.  The count value stored is the instantaneous one when the comparator threshold is crossed.  
Analog biases (discussed in the next section) should be adjusted to accommodate a ramp that is matched to a 
12-bit  counter  full  count  period.    At  33MHz,  this  corresponds  to  approximately  100µs.    Faster  conversion 
times have been obtained at higher clock rates and increased slew rates.  No significant degradation has been 
observed  with  a  100MHz  clock,  corresponding  to  a  conversion  time  of  40µs.    A  detailed  description  of 
working, reference firmware is described below and shown graphically in Figure 5.   
 
Firmware timing cycle: as detailed in Table 1, LCNT_Done starts Block “Lab_ADC”. Q_DG1 and Q_DG2 
are the internal signals to generate DRC and GCCLR signal. DRC is the signal to clear the data register, while 
GCCLR  is  the  clear  signal  to  clear  the  gray  code  counter.  Several  clocks  after  DRC  and  GCCLR  signal, 
Ramp  signal  starts.  In  the  meantime,  GCK,  the  Gray  Code  Counter  Clock  starts.  Since  this  is  a  12-bit 
Wilkinson  ADC,  after  4096  clock  (CLK)  cycles,  Ramp  and  GCK  stop  while  ADC_Done  signal  is  on. 
ADC_Done starts next block: “Lab_ADC2FIFO”. When the 16-bit counter finishes counting, Clear_Cnt is on 
for a WCLK to clear the counter.

2.3.  ADC Data transfer 
 
Data  stored  in  the  ADC  registers  may  be  randomly  accessed,  which  can  reduce  readout  latency  in  the  case 
where  not  all  channels  need  to  be  read  out.    Select  lines  S0  through  S7  select  one  of  256  columns  when 
SELmain  is  active.    Lines  S0  and  S1  decode  one  of  the  4  “tail”  sample  columns  when  SELtail  is  active.  
Note:  SELmain  and SELtail must not be active at the same time in order to avoid a bus conflict. 
 
With a column selected, all 9 possible channel samples are available to an output multiplexer.  Select lines 
CS0 through CS3 determine which of these channels are presented at the output of the LABRADOR3 chip.  
Ultimate  readout  speed  will  be  determined  by  the  internal  and  external  bus  skew  and  settling  time.    With 
careful timing considerations, readout at 100MHz should be possible, corresponding to about 25µs. 
 
 

3. Implementation Details 

 
Acquisition  of  high  quality  RF  data  from  the  LABRADOR3  chip  requires  careful  attention  to  detail  in  the 
implementation of the accompanying control and biasing circuits.  A major improvement in the third version 
of the LABRADOR chip has been the simplification of the biasing circuitry.  Input coupling is also simplified 
by  a  modification  to  the  internal  termination  structure,  which  should  provide  a  proper  50Ω  termination,  as 
well as removing a DC slew across the sampling array. 
 

Input Biasing Circuits 

3.1. 
 
Correct  operation  of  the  SCA  sampling  array  requires  the  biasing  of  the  DC  offset  of  the  ac-coupled  RF 
inputs.    A  low  impedance,  low  inductance  connection  to  a  power  reference  at  the  desired  offset  voltage  is 
suggested.  In practice, a microstrip or stripline can be used with analog ground as the reference plane up until 
the  ac-coupling  capacitor.    After  this  natural  break,  and  continuing  under  the  input  section  of  the 
LABRADOR3  chip  is  this  offset  voltage,  which  may  be  coupled  into  the  reference  voltage  input.  For 
symmetric signals, the optimal value for this offset is in the range of 1.2-1.3V.  In the case of a single-ended 
signal, for instance for a PMT signal, this offset can be adjusted to maximize the usable dynamic range. 
 
 
The  choice  of  ac-coupling  capacitor  depends  upon  the  desired  signal  cut-off  frequency.    For  RF  sampling, 
there is no benefit to allowing lower frequencies than useful.  At 10MHz this corresponds to about 260pF and 
at 100MHz about 26pF.  As a high-pass filter, the choice of capacitor may be calculated as: 
 

C = 1/(2π*50Ω*fc) 
 
Where the 50Ω corresponds to the termination resistance of the LABRADOR3 and fc is the desired cut-off 
frequency.

4. Performance Expectations 

 
To  allow  a  designer  to  estimate  the  performance  that  may  be  expected  of  the  various  aspects  of  the 
LABRADOR3  analog  performance,  a  few  measurement  plots  are  shown  below.    A  more  comprehensive 
summary  may  be  found  in  the  STUD  or  SURFv2  Testing  Summaries,  which  will  be  prepared  and  will  be 
made available on the ID Lab web site when they are completed.   
 

4.1.  ADC Performance 
 
Figure 6 below shows a linearity scan for the Calibration ADC inside the LABRADOR, which is identical to 
those  that  comprise  the  rest  of  the  Wilkinson  ADCs  of  the  main  sampling  array.    Excellent  linearity  is 
observed over 0.4-2.1V with the standard parameters shown in Table 2.  The fitted gain is approximately: 
 

1.6 counts/mV  or   0.6mV/least count 
 
Compression occurs at the upper and lower end of this plot and some additional calibration may be required 
to make use of this range.

Figure  6:    Measured  on-chip  ADC  response  to  a  calibration  input  voltage.    A  12-bit  code  is  latched  when  a 
comparator determines that the input ramp voltage has exceeded the reference voltage threshold.  Compression 
occurs near the upper and lower power rails. 

4.2.  Dynamic Range 
From previous performance measurements with LABRADOR and LABRADOR2, a few counts of noise are 
attainable for the gain indicated in the previous subsection.  For 12-bits, corresponding to 4096 total counts, 
this places the usable dynamic range in the range of 9-10 bits above noise.  Optimizing the signal range to 
match  these  is  the  job  of  the  design  engineer  who  will  employ  the  LABRADOR3  chip.    This  optimization 
involves a combination of choosing input signal gain, ramp speed and encoding range.   

4.3.  Frequency Response 
 
A key parameter for the successful operation of the LABRADOR as a GHz bandwidth, greater than Nyquist 
sampler, is the frequency response.  As seen in Figure 7, there is some amount of resonance being developed 
for  periodic  signals  between  about  600  –  850  MHz  for  the  LABRADOR  chip  as  implemented  on  the 
SURFpro board.  This is believe to be attributable to an LC resonance between the TQFP bonding wires and 
the  internal  capacitance  and  is  under  investigation.    Confirmatory  evidence  is  seen  in  Time  Domain 
Reflectrometry measurements where there is a peak in the VSWR in this same range.  Repackaging the die 
onto a BGA package may improve the situation.  The situation may be somewhat modified for LABRADOR3 
as the internal termination scheme is different.  Detailed testing will be performed. 
 
Further test results will be posted on the Instrumentation Development Laboratory web site as they become 
available, though since the RF part of the LABRADOR3 is almost identical to LABRADOR(2), only modest 
differences are anticipated.

6.Chip Layout and Packaging 
 
All  LABRADOR  are  currently  packaged  in  a  square  TQFP-100  package  and  a  die  photograph  is  shown 
below, with dimensions of approximately 2.5mm2. 
 

Figure 8: A roughly to scale comparison of generations of the LABRADOR chip.  Stripline RF inputs couple in at 
the left.  A column of 128 Wilkinson ADCs are found to the right of the sampling arrays for LABRADOR and 
LABRADOR2, while the LABRADOR3 has the array densely packed with ADCs.  As a result the die is slightly 
wider, though maintains the same height.

Abstract: 

Keywords: 

In  Single  Photon  Emission  Computed  Tomography  (SPECT),  3D  images  usually  reconstructed  by 

performing  a  set  of  bidimensional  (2D)  analytical  or  iterative  reconstructions  can  also  be 

reconstructed using an iterative reconstruction algorithm involving a 3D projector. Accurate Monte 

Carlo (MC) simulations modeling all the physical effects that affect the imaging process can be used 

to estimate this projector. However, the accuracy of the projector is affected by the stochastic nature 

of MC simulations. In this paper, we study the accuracy of the reconstructed images with respect to 

the  number  of  simulated  histories  used  to  estimate  the  MC  projector.  Furthermore,  we  study  the 

impact of applying the bootstrapping technique when estimating the projector.

Introduction: 

Single  Photon  Emission  Computed  Tomography  (SPECT)  is  an  imaging  modality  appropriate  for 

visualizing  functional  information  about  a  patient’s  specific  organ  or  a  body  system.  A  radio-

pharmaceutical, which is a pharmaceutical labeled with a radioactive isotope, is administrated to the 

patient.  The  radiopharmaceutical  is  chosen  as  a  function  of  the  organ  to  be  studied.  For  example, 

Iodine-131  is  appropriate  for  thyroid  imaging.  In  case  of  SPECT,  the  radio-pharmaceutical  emits 

single  gamma  rays  isotropically.  Emitted  gamma  photons  are  then  detected  in  specific  directions 

using a rotating gamma camera. Rays detected in a given direction yield a projection. At the end of 

an  acquisition  process,  a  set  of  two-dimensional  (2D)  projections  is  available  to  reconstruct  the 

three-dimensional  (3D)  radio-pharmaceutical  distribution  within  the  body.  In  the  absence  of 

attenuation and scatter of the emitted gamma rays, each point of a projection corresponds to the sum 

of photons emitted by the source along a straight line (Fig. 1); the detected signal intensity is then: 
I =

f(x,y)du

  

∫

L

where  I  is  the  detected  signal,  f(x  ,y)  the  concentration  of  the  radio-pharmaceutical  at  (x,y)  and  L 

represents the line perpendicular to the detector (the gamma camera).

f(x,y)

The  aim  objective  is  to  calculate  the  radio-pharmaceutical  concentration  f(x,y)  at  each  point  (x,y) 

knowing    a  set  of  projections  I  along  different  directions.  This  is  feasible  by  inverting  the  Radon 

transform, thus reconstructing transaxial slices assuming that photons emitted from a transaxial slice 

are detected within a single line of each 2D planar projection.  

A  3D  radio-pharmaceutical  distribution  f(x,y,z)  can  then  be  reconstructed  as  a  set  of  2D 

reconstruction  of  f(x,y)  radio-pharmaceutical  distribution.  The  main  problem  with  this  approach  is 

that  signal  measured  in  projections  is  affected  by  physical  effects  such  as  scatter,  attenuation  and 

detector response. Therefore, photons emitted from a transaxial slice may be detected not only in the 

2

projection line facing the slice but also in the neighboring slices. It has been shown that, in realistic 

configurations, the percentage of such photons is not negligible [Munley et al. 1991]. Furthermore, 

due to attenuation of the photons within the patient, not all emitted photons reach the detector. Those 

effects dramatically degrade the reconstructed image. When writing the reconstruction problem in its 

form  where  projections  and  image  to  be  reconstructed  are  sampled,  iterative  reconstruction 

algorithms  can  be  used.  This  makes  it  possible  to  account  for  most  degrading  physical  effects 

affecting the projections, by considering a projector modeling these physical effects. Using iterative 

reconstruction, a 3D radio-pharmaceutical distribution f(x,y,z) can be reconstructed either as a set of 

2D  f(x,y)  distributions,  each  f(x,y)  distribution  resulting  from  a  2D  reconstruction  involving  a  2D 

projector,  ignoring  3D  degrading  effects,  or  better,  by  a  fully  3D  reconstruction  involving  a  3D 

projector accounting for 3D physical effects.  

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have recently been proposed to calculate a 3D projector, in a method 

called  F3DMC  (Fully  3  Dimensions  Monte  Carlo)  [Lazaro  et  al.  2004].  However,  the  accuracy  of 

Monte  Carlo  simulations  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the  random  number  generators,  seeds  used 

for  these  generators,  number  of  random  drawing,  or  correlations  between  simulations.  In  that 

context,  we  tested  the  impact  of  the  number  of  drawing  and  the  value  of  bootstrapping  to  reduce 

variance of the projector element estimates [Cheng et al. 2001], hence hopefully improve the quality 

of the reconstructed images. 

Material and Methods 

1. Monte Carlo simulations 

MC simulations were performed using the software package GATE [Jan et al. 2004]. A cylindrical 

water phantom including 5 rods (diameters from 4.8 to 11.1 mm) and a bony rod (diameter of 12.7 

mm) (Fig 2) was considered. Rod-to-background Tc99m activity concentration ratio between any of 

the five smallest rods and the background was set to 4. The white rod represents the bony rod.

Figure 2. Simulated phantom 

The  simulated  camera  modeled  an  AXIS-Philips  equipped  with  a  LEHR  (Low  Energy  High 

Resolution) collimator. 64 projections of 64x64 pixels (pixel dimension= 3.125mm) were simulated 

and photons detected in the 126-154 keV energy window were considered.  

The projector needed for F3DMC was calculated by simulating a uniform activity distribution in the 

phantom propagation media. The 3D object to be reconstructed was sampled into 64x64x64 voxels 

(voxel  dimension  =  3.125mm),  yielding  a  projector  with  at  most  64^6  elements.  In  practice,  only 

non-zero  elements  were  stored.  Given  the  projections  and  the  projector,  the  3D  object  was 

reconstructed using F3DMC, by solving the linear system using a Maximum Likelihood Estimation 

Method (MLEM) algorithm [Miller et al. 1985]. 

2. Image assessment 

In  order  to  assess  the  quality  of  the  reconstructed  images  (Fig.  3.  (b)),  rod-to-background  activity 

ratios  were  measured  and  compared  with  reference  values.  Reference  values  were  obtained  by 

considering the sampled activity distribution that was actually simulated (Fig. 3. (a))

3. Statistics used for projector estimate 

An accurate projector can be obtained by generating a large number of events in MC simulations, to 

reduce the standard deviation of each value within the projector. Given that the maximum duration 

of  each  simulation  was  24  hours,  we  performed  462  separate  sub-simulations,  supposed  to  be 

independent using the Independent Sequence (IS) technique, i.e. initializing the same generator with 

‘n’  different  seeds  [Codington  1996].  The  resulting  projector  involved  in  F3DMC  method  was 

calculated with 74 billion emitted photons from which 16 million photons were detected in the 126-

154  keV  window.  Each  element 

ijP   of  the  projector  was  defined  as  the  probability  that  a  photon 

emitted from a voxel i is detected in the pixel j (1)

where  Nij  is  the  number  of  photons  emitted  from  voxel  i  and  detected  in  pixel  j,  and  Ni  is  the 

number of photons emitted from voxel i.    

4.  Impact  of  the  number  of  simulated  events  on  the  reconstructed  image 

quality 

The principal problem faced while using MC techniques is the long duration of simulations making 

it difficult to have a large number of statistical histories used in the calculation of the projector. We 

therefore studied the change of the activity ratio with respect to the number of generated events to 

determine whether it reaches a plateau, making it unnecessary to perform additional simulations. 

5. A Mean Projector as a solution to reduce noise 

The  stochastic  nature  of  Monte-Carlo  simulations  induces  a  statistical  noise.  We  thought  that  by 

reconstructing  images  with  a  mean  projector,  probability  values  may  be  smoothed  and  we  could 

reconstruct  images  with  better  homogeneity  and  thus  with  less  noise.  In  fact,  let’s  assume  that  in 

order to calculate the projector we perform four simulations Sim1, Sim2, Sim3 and Sim4 and that we 

calculate  four  projectors  P1,  P2,  P3  and  P4  using  respectively  each  of  these  simulations.  The 

difference in the calculation of a projector element 

ijP  performed once by appending the four sub-

simulations  (P_initial)  and  another  time  by  calculating  a  mean  of  these  four  sub-simulations 

(P_mean) is shown in the table 1.

Obviously,  we  can  notice  that  except  the  case  where  n1=  n2=  n3=  n4,   

ijP   has  different  values  in 

P_initial  and  P_mean.  In  our  case,  we  have  used  the  results  of  460  sub-simulations  in  order  to

calculate a set of 20 projectors each one calculated from a set of 23 sub-simulations; we obtain so a 
set of 20 sample-projectors Pi (i˛

[1…20]). 

6. Bootstrapping as an alternate issue to reduce noise 

 

Statistically, it is known that the standard deviation is an inverse function of the number of measures. 
Each of  the  projectors Pi  (i ˛

 [1…20]) calculated above can be considered   as a sample projector.  

By re-sampling, bootstrapping generates a new set of samples and increases the statistics included in 

the calculation of  the  projector  estimate and  thus reduces  the  variance  of  estimated  parameters

relative quantitation values for each rod calculated on images reconstructed with the initial projector 

and the bootstrapped projector (-B refers to a bootstrapped projector). Curves obtained by the initial 

projector and bootstrapped projector are almost superposed.  

Results 

In order to study the change of relative quantitation with respect to the number of generated events, 

we calculated projectors corresponding to different statistics going from a projector calculated from 

33 sub-simulations to 462 sub-simulations with a step of 33 simulations. We then reconstructed the 

image  using  each  of  the  resulting  14  calculated  projectors:  P33,  P66…P462.  The  accuracy  of  the 

reconstructed images was assessed by measuring the activity ratio in the 6 rods (Fig 5). Results were 

plotted  for  each  rod  (rod’s  diameter  expressed  in  millimeter).  We  can  see  the  improvement  in 

accuracy with the increase of generated events. The reference to obtain is given in the last column.

Instead  of  calculating  the  mean  projector  of  20  elementary  projectors  Pi  (i  going  from  1  to  20  in 

increasing order), we drew randomly 20 projectors from the set of the 20 projectors Pi (example: P1, 

P2, P2, P3,  P6, P6….P14, P20) (using drawing with replacement). We repeated this operation 100 

times  and  thus  obtained  100  combinations  of  20  randomly  selected  sample  projectors,  each  one 

forming a bootstrap sample [Chernick et al 1999].(Fig 4) 

Figure 8 (a) shows the impact of bootstrapping in the apparition, within the probability spectrum, of 

new probability values; this could be explained by the fact that bootstrapped projector is obtained by 

dividing by 2000 the sum of the sub-projectors drawn randomly. The zoom on the zone where a pick 

appeared in the initial projector and the mean projector (Fig.8.b), shows that bootstrapping induces a 

quasi-stochastic distribution and that a set of new generated picks was involved within the 

bootstrapped projector.

Discussion 

Results shown in figure 4 demonstrate that overall, best accuracy is obtained for the largest number 

of  histories  considered  for  calculating  the  MC  projector,  as  expected  from  the  stochastic  nature  of 

MC  simulations.  We  also  notice  that  even  if  P132  (calculated  from  132  sub-simulations)  included 

fewer histories than P231 (calculated from 231 sub-simulations), it tended to give better results than 

P231, which also reflects the stochastic nature of the calculations involved. Bias between reference 

values and the plateau could be explained by the fact that the number of simulated events involved in 

the computation of the projector is still not high enough. 

Results  shown  in  figure  4  suggest  that  initial  projector  and  bootstrapped  projector  are  nearly 

identical  which  means  that  combinations  of  initial  projectors  Pi  in  almost  all  cases  yielded  a 

bootstrapped projector quasi-equal to the initial projector.  

The weak decrease of variance in the bootstrapped projector (Table 2) indicates that we may still not 

have  an  important  statistics  involved  in  the  calculation  of  the  projectors  (P1…  P20)  and  that  we 

should  perform  more  simulations.  This  later  comment  could  be  a  first  explanation  of  the  new 

generated picks in the bootstrapped projector. 

A  second  explanation  could  be  that  the  projector  calculated  from  the  460  simulations  is  already  a 

kind of  bootstrapped projector since the Independent Sequence technique used seeds selected in an 

increasing order (not randomly). Indeed the seed initialization was taken in the [1,460] interval. It is 

known that the IS can lead to encapsulated sub-sequences, since a random number generated in one 

sub-sequence can match the seed used for another sub-sequence. Some authors warn scientists who 

run MC experiments in parallel [Hellekalek 1998]. The problem lies in the parallelization of pseudo 

random  numbers.  As  for  many  parallelizing  techniques  of  Pseudo  Random  numbers,  the  main 

problem of those methods is the "Long-Range" correlation [De Matteis et al, 1988]. Variants of the 

known  techniques  have  been  developed,  a  notable  one  is  the  parameterization  method  which  is  a 

variant of the IS technique [Srinivasan et al, 1999]. It consists in parameterizing both the seed and 

iteration  function  (i.e.  the  function  that  gives  the  next  state  in  the  sequence).  One  of  the  main 

contribution of this variant is that it results in a scalable period. 

A  way to confirm this hypothesis is to have a simulation where  we  simulate a number of histories 

equal to the number of histories simulated within 460 separated simulations. Once this simulation is 

performed,  we  can  compare  the  results  of  the  quantitative  ratio  with  those  obtained  by  performing 

460  separated  simulations  with  independent  seeds.  However,  we  are  still  investigating  in  order  to 

understand the spectrum of bootstrapped projector.

Conclusion and Perspectives: 

This  paper  is  placed  in  the  context  of  tomographic  reconstruction  in  Single  Photon  Emission 

Computed Tomography (SPECT). The projector used for reconstruction is obtained by Monte Carlo 

Simulation. Thus we have studied the impact of the number of generated events on the accuracy of 

the projector. We studied various issues in order to improve its accuracy either by computing a mean 

projector or by applying the bootstrap technique which has been detailed above.  

Even if results were not satisfying so far, investigations are in progress to improve the accuracy of 

the  projector.  As  a  solution  to  the  slowness  of  GATE  simulations,  we  intend  to  use  faster  MC 

software named SimSet [Lewellen et al. 1998]. With this simulator, we can quickly generate a high 

number N of events but it relies on some analytical approximations of stochastic laws that could also 

be  source  of  inaccuracy.  This  high  number  of  events  could  then  be  split  into  20  sub-simulations, 

from which bootstrapping can be implemented as described above. The fact that the variance in the 

bootstrapped  projector  hasn’t  decreased  enough  leads  us  to  investigate  two  possibilities:  either  the 

number  of  histories  is  still  not  enough  or  the  possibility  of  an  eventual  correlation  between  sub-

simulations. Getting rid of possible dependencies between simulations and increasing the number of 

histories  by  using  a  faster  simulator  (SimSet),  bootstrapping  might  still  improve  the  quality  of  the 

projector.

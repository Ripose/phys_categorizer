Abstract

The most general possible central extensions of two whole families of Lie
algebras, which can be obtained by contracting the special pseudo-unitary al-
gebras su(p, q) of the Cartan series Al and the pseudo-unitary algebras u(p, q),
are completely determined and classiﬁed for arbitrary p, q. In addition to the
su(p, q) and u(p, q) algebras, whose second cohomology group is well known
to be trivial, each family includes many non-semisimple algebras; their central
extensions, which are explicitly given, can be classiﬁed into three types as far
as their properties under contraction are involved. A closed expression for the
dimension of the second cohomology group of any member of these families
of algebras is given.

1 Introduction

This paper investigates the Lie algebra cohomology of the unitary Cayley–Klein
(CK) families of Lie algebras in any dimension. These families, also called ‘quasi-
unitary’ algebras, include both the special (pseudo-)unitary su(p, q) and (pseudo-)uni-
tary u(p, q) algebras —which have only trivial central extensions—, as well as
many other obtained from these by a sequence of contractions, which are no longer
semisimple and may have non-trivial central extensions.

The paper can be considered as a further step in a series of studies on the
CK families of Lie algebras. These have both mathematical interest and physical
relevance. The families of CK algebras provide a frame to describe the behaviour
of mathematical properties of algebras under contraction; in physical terms this is
related to some kind of approximation. The central extensions for the family of
quasi-orthogonal algebras, also in the general situation and for any dimension, have
been determined in a previous paper [1]. We refer to this work for references and
for physical motivations; we simply remark here that there are three main reasons
behind the interest in the second cohomology groups for Lie algebras. First, in any
quantum theory the relevant representations of any symmetry group are projective
instead of linear ones. Second, homogeneous symplectic manifolds under a group
appear as orbits of the coadjoint representation of either the group itself or of a
central extension. And third, quasi-invariant Lagrangians are also directly linked to
the central extensions of the group; these can be related also to Wess–Zumino terms.
In addition to the references in [1], we may add that Wess–Zumino–Witten models
leading to central extensions have also been studied (see e.g. [2, 3] and references
therein).

The knowledge of the second cohomology group for a Lie algebra relies on the
general solution of a set of linear equations, yet some general results allow to bypass
the calculations in special cases. For instance, the second cohomology group is trivial
for semisimple Lie algebras. But once a contraction is made, the semisimple charac-
ter disappears, and the contracted algebra might have non-trivial central extensions.
Instead of ﬁnding the general solution for the extension equations on a case-by-case
basis, our approach is to do these calculations for a whole family including a large
number of algebras simultaneously. This program has been developed for the quasi-
orthogonal algebras, and here we discuss the ‘next’ quasi-unitary case. There are
two main advantages in this approach. First, it allows to record, in a form easily
retrievable, a large number of results which can be needed in applications, both in
mathematics and in physics. This avoids at once and for all the case-by-case type
computation of the central extensions of algebras included in the unitary families.
And second, it sheds some further light on the interrelations between cohomology
and contractions, by discussing in particular examples how and when a contraction
increases the cohomology of the algebra: central extensions can be classed into three
types, with diﬀerent behaviour under contraction.

The section 2 is devoted to the description of the two families of unitary CK
algebras. We show how to obtain these as graded contractions of the compact al-
gebras su(N + 1) and u(N + 1), and we provide some details on their structure.
It should be remarked that the CK unitary algebras are associated to the complex
hermitian spaces with metrics of diﬀerent signatures and to their contractions. In
section 3 the general solution to the central extension problem for these algebras is
given; this includes the completely explicit description of all possible central exten-
sions and the discussion of their triviality. A closed formula for the dimension of the
second cohomology group is also obtained. Computational details on the procedure
to solve the central extension problem are given in an Appendix. The results are

2

illustrated in section 4 for the lowest dimensional examples. Finally, some remarks
close the paper.

2 The CK families of quasi-unitary algebras

The family of special quasi-unitary algebras, which involves the simple Lie algebras
su(p, q), as well as many non-simple algebras obtained by ˙In¨on¨u–Wigner [4] con-
traction from su(p, q) can be easily described in terms of graded contraction theory
[5, 6], taking the compact real form su(N + 1) of the simple algebras in the series
AN as starting point. As it is well known, the special unitary algebra can be re-
alised by complex antihermitian and traceless matrices, and is the quotient of the
algebra of all complex antihermitian matrices by its center (generated by the pure
imaginary multiples of the identity). It will be convenient to consider the family
of quasi-unitary algebras altogether; these can be similarly described in terms of
graded contractions of u(N + 1), and will include algebras obtained from u(p, q)
by ˙In¨on¨u–Wigner contractions. Let us consider the (fundamental) matrix represen-
tation of the algebras su(N + 1) and u(N + 1), as given by the complex matrices
Jab, Mab, Bl and Jab, Mab, Bl, I:

Jab = −eab + eba Mab = i(eab + eba) Bl = i(el−1,l−1 − ell)

I = i

where a < b, a, b = 0, . . . , N, l = 1, . . . , N, and where eab means the (N +1)×(N +1)
matrix with a single 1 entry in row a and column b. The commutation relations
involved in either of these algebras are given by

[Jab, Jac] = Jbc
[Mab, Mac] = Jbc

The algebra su(N + 1) has a grading by a group Z⊗N

related to a set of N
commuting involutions in the subalgebra so(N + 1) generated by Jab [7, 8].
If
S denotes any subset of the set of indices {0, 1, . . . , N}, and χS(a) denotes the
characteristic function over S, then each of the linear mappings given by

is an involutive automorphism of the algebra su(N + 1); by considering all possible
subsets of indices we get 2N diﬀerent automorphisms deﬁning a Z⊗N
grading for
this algebra. The corresponding graded contractions of su(N + 1) constitute a large
set of Lie algebras, but there exists a particular subset or family of these graded
contractions, nearer to the simple ones, which essentially preserves the properties
associated to simplicity, and which belong to the so termed [9, 10] ‘quasi-simple’
algebras. This family, to be deﬁned below, encompasses the special pseudo-unitary
algebras (in the AN Cartan series) as well as their nearest non-simple contractions.
By taking the generator I as invariant under all involutions, this grading can be
extended to the algebra u(N + 1), whose graded contractions include the pseudo-
unitary algebras as well as many non-semisimple algebras; again a particular family
of these graded contractions, to be introduced below, preserves properties associated
to semi-simplicity. Collectively, all these algebras (special or not) are called quasi-
unitary; these are also called Cayley–Klein algebras of unitary type, or unitary CK
algebras, since they are exactly those algebras behind the geometries of a complex
hermitian space with a projective metric in the CK sense [10]. Another view to
these algebras is given in [11].

The overall details on the structure of this family are similar to the orthogonal
case. The set of unitary CK algebras is parametrised by N real coeﬃcients ωa
(a = 1, . . . , N), whose values codify in a convenient way the pertinent information on
the Lie algebra structure [12, 13]. In terms of the N(N + 1)/2 two-index coeﬃcients

are also assumed to be diﬀerent.

2.1 The unitary CK groups

The connection with groups of isometries of a hermitian metric is as follows:
for
a generic choice, with all ωa 6= 0, let us consider the space CN +1 endowed with a
hermitian (sesqui)linear form h.|.iω : CN +1 × CN +1 → C associated to the matrix

Iω = diag (1, ω01, ω02, . . . , ω0N ) = diag (1, ω1, ω1ω2, . . . , ω1 · · · ωN );

(2.11)

this is, for any pair of vectors a, b ∈ CN +1,

ha|biω := ¯a0b0 + ¯a1ω1b1 + ¯a2ω1ω2b2 + . . . =

¯aiω0ibi.

(2.12)

N

X
i=0

Let us deﬁne the group Uω1,...,ωN (N +1) ≡ Uω(N +1) as the group of linear isometries
of the hermitian metric (2.11). The isometry condition

hUa|Ubiω = ha|biω

∀ a, b ∈ CN +1,

implies for the matrix U ∈ Uω(N + 1) the condition

U †IωU = Iω

∀U ∈ Uω(N + 1).

For the corresponding Lie algebra the above relation leads to

X †Iω + IωX = 0

∀X ∈ uω(N + 1).

This Lie algebra is generated by the complex matrices (cf. (2.1))

Jab = −ωabeab + eba Mab = i(ωabeab + eba) Bl = i(el−1,l−1 − ell)

I = i

eaa

with a < b, a, b = 0, . . . , N,

l = 1, . . . , N.

The group SUω1,...,ωN (N + 1) ≡ SUω(N + 1) is deﬁned similarly by adding the
unimodularity condition det(U) = 1; this leads for the Lie algebra to the condition
trace(X) = 0, so the algebra suω(N + 1) is generated by Jab, Mab, Bl alone.

The action of the groups Uω(N + 1) and SUω(N + 1) in CN +1 is not transitive,

and the ‘sphere’ with equation

hx|xiω :=

¯xiω0ixi = 1

(2.17)

is stable. For the action of SUω(N + 1), the isotropy subgroup of a reference point
in this sphere, say (1, 0, . . . , 0), is easily shown to be isomorphic to SUω2,ω3,...,ωN (N),
and the isotropy subgroup of the ray of a reference point is Uω2,ω3,...,ωN (N), locally
isomorphic to U(1) ⊗ SUω2,ω3,...,ωN (N). The quotient spaces SUω1,ω2,ω3,...,ωN (N +
1)/(U(1)⊗SUω2,ω3,...,ωN (N)) are a family of hermitian spaces which includes examples

with non-deﬁnite and/or degenerate hermitian metrics; the CK scheme provides
a common frame to discuss all them jointly. The most familiar corresponds to
ω2 = ω3 = . . . = ωN = 1, and depends on a single parameter ω1 = K; when
K > 0 or K < 0 these are the usual elliptic or hyperbolic complex hermitian spaces
of (holomorphic constant) curvature K; when ω1 = 0 we get the ‘Euclidean’ ﬂat
hermitian space (ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space).

When the constants ωa are allowed to vanish, the set of isometries of the hermi-
tian metric (2.11) is larger than the group generated by the matrices Jab, Mab, Bl, I.
In this case, there are additional geometric structures in CN +1 (related to the ex-
istence of additional invariant foliations similar to the one implied by (2.17)), and
the proper deﬁnition of the automorphism group of these structures leads again to
the group generated by the matrix Lie algebra (2.16) with the commutation rela-
tions (2.8)–(2.10). These matrix realisations can be considered as the fundamental
representation of the unitary CK Lie algebras suω(N + 1) and uω(N + 1).

Since each coeﬃcient ωa can be positive, negative or zero, each unitary CK family
comprises 3N Lie algebras although some of them may be isomorphic. For instance,
the map

Jab → J ′

ab = −JN −b,N −a Mab → M ′

ab = −MN −b,N −a Bl → B′

l = BN +1−l

(2.18)

provides an isomorphism

suω1,ω2,...,ωN−1,ωN (N + 1) ≃ suωN ,ωN−1,...,ω2,ω1(N + 1).

(2.19)

2.2 Structure of the unitary CK algebras

The unitary CK algebras suω(N + 1) contain many subalgebras isomorphic to al-
gebras in both families suω(M + 1) and uω(M + 1), M < N. To best describe
this, we introduce a new set of Cartan subalgebra generators for suω(N + 1), Ga
(a = 1, . . . , N), deﬁned by

Ga :=

+

1
a(cid:16)B1 + 2B2 + . . . + (a − 1)Ba−1(cid:17) + Ba
N + 1 − a (cid:16)(N − a)Ba+1 + (N − a − 1)Ba+2 + . . . + BN (cid:17).

In the matrix realisation (2.16) Ga is given by

so each Ga appears as a direct sum of two blocks, each proportional with a pure
imaginary coeﬃcient to the identity matrix.

Denoting by Xij the pair of generators {Jij, Mij}, we can check that the set
hXij, i, j = 0, 1, . . . , a−1 ; Bl, l = 1, . . . , a−1i closes a Lie subalgebra suω1,...,ωa−1(a).

6

(2.20)

(2.21)

Furthermore, Ga commutes with all the generators in this subalgebra, so that the
former generators plus aGa close an algebra isomorphic to uω1,...,ωa−1(a).

Similarly, the set hXij, i, j = a, a + 1, . . . , N; Bl, l = a + 1, . . . , Ni closes the
special unitary CK Lie algebra suωa+1,...,ωN (N +1−a), and by adding −(N +1−a)Ga
we get an algebra isomorphic to uωa+1,...,ωN (N + 1 − a).

This structure can be visualised by arranging the basis generators as in Fig. 2.1.

Figure 2.1: Generators of the (special) unitary CK algebras

The special unitary subalgebras suω1,...,ωa−1(a) and suωa+1,...,ωN (N + 1 − a) corre-
spond, in this order, to the two triangles to the left and below the rectangle, both ex-
cluding the generator Ga. The unitary subalgebras uω1,...,ωa−1(a) and uωa+1,...,ωN (N +
1 − a) correspond, in this order, to the two triangles to the left and below the rect-
angle, both including the generator Ga. This generator Ga closes a u(1) subalgebra.

We sum up the details relative to the structure of the special unitary CK algebras

in two statements

• When all ωa are diﬀerent from zero, suω(N + 1) is a pseudo-unitary simple Lie
algebra su(p, q) in the Cartan series AN (p and q are the number of positive
and negative signs in diagonal of the metric matrix (2.11), p + q = N + 1).

• If a coeﬃcient ωa vanishes, the CK algebra is a non-simple Lie algebra which

has a semidirect structure

suω1,...,ωa−1,ωa=0,ωa+1,...,ωN (N + 1) ≡

t ⊙ (suω1,...,ωa−1(a) ⊕ u(1) ⊕ suωa+1,...,ωN (N + 1 − a)),

(2.22)

where the subalgebras appearing in (2.22) are generated by

t = hXij, i = 0, 1, . . . , a − 1, j = a, a + 1, . . . , Ni
suω1,...,ωa−1(a) = hXij, i, j = 0, 1, . . . , a − 1 ; Bl, l = 1, . . . , a − 1i
u(1) = hGai
suωa+1,...,ωN (N + 1 − a) = hXij, i, j = a, a + 1, . . . , N; Bl, l = a + 1, . . . , Ni.
(2.23)

7

We note that t is an abelian subalgebra of dimension 2a(N + 1 − a). In terms
of the triangular arrangement of generators (Fig. 2.1), t is spanned by the
generators inside the rectangle; we remark that these generators do not close
a subalgebra when ωa 6= 0. The three remaining sets are always subalgebras,
no matter of whether or not ωa = 0.

For the particular case ω1 = 0 (or, mutatis mutandis, ωN = 0) the contracted

algebra is a quasi-unitary inhomogeneous algebra,

su0,ω2,...,ωN (N + 1) ≡ t2N ⊙ uω2,...,ωN (N).

The subindex 2N in t denotes the real dimension of t ≡ CN which can be iden-
tiﬁed with the space SU0,ω2,ω3,...,ωN (N + 1)/Uω2,...,ωN (N), with the natural action
of Uω2,...,ωN (N) (locally isomorphic to U(1) ⊗ SUω2,ω3,...,ωN (N)) over CN . This di-
rect product appeared as the isotropy subalgebra of a ray for the natural action of
SU0,ω2,ω3,...,ωN (N +1) on CN +1 discussed after (2.17). In the case where ω2, ω3, . . . , ωN
are all diﬀerent from zero, the algebra is an ordinary inhomogeneous pseudo-unitary
(not special) algebra:

t2N ⊙ uω2,...,ωN (N) ≡ iu(p, q)

p + q = N

and in this case t2N can be identiﬁed to the N-dimensional ﬂat complex hermitian
space with signature p, q determined as the number of positive and negative terms
in the sequence (1, ω2, ω2ω3, . . . , ω2 . . . ωN ).

When several coeﬃcients ωa are equal to zero the algebra suω1,ω2,...,ωN (N + 1) has
simultaneously several such decompositions. The more contracted case corresponds
to taking all ωa equal to zero; this gives rise to the special unitary ﬂag algebra.

3 Central extensions

Now we proceed to compute in a uniﬁed way all the central extensions for the two
unitary families of CK algebras, for arbitrary choices of the constants ωa and in
any dimension. Let G be an arbitrary r-dimensional Lie algebra with generators
{X1, . . . , Xr} and structure constants C k
ij. A central extension G of the algebra G
by the one-dimensional algebra generated by Ξ will have (r + 1) generators (Xi, Ξ)
with commutation relations given by

[Xi, Xj] =

C k

ijXk + ξijΞ

[Ξ, Xi] = 0.

(3.1)

r

X
k=1

The extension coeﬃcients or central charges ξij must be antisymmetric in the indices
i, j, ξji = −ξij and must fulﬁl the following conditions coming from the Jacobi
identities in the extended Lie algebra:

X
k=1

(cid:0)

C k

ijξkl + C k

jlξki + C k

liξkj

(cid:1)

(3.2)

These extension coeﬃcients are the coordinates (ξ(Xi, Xj) = ξij) of the anti-
symmetric two-tensor ξ which is the two-cocycle of the speciﬁc extension being
considered, and (3.2) is the two-cocycle condition for the Lie algebra cohomology.

Let us consider the ‘abstract’ extended Lie algebra G with the Lie brackets (3.1)

and let us perform a change of generators:

Xi → X ′

i = Xi + µiΞ,

where µi are arbitrary real numbers. The commutation rules for the generators {X ′
i}
become

[X ′

i, X ′

j] =

C k

k + (ξij −

Thus, the general expression for the two-coboundary δµ generated by µ is

Two two-cocycles diﬀering by a two-coboundary lead to equivalent extensions; the
classes of equivalence of non-trivial two-cocycles associated with the tensors ξ de-
termine the second cohomology group H 2(G, R).

3.1 The general solution to the extension problem for the

unitary CK algebras

In a previous paper [1] we have given the general solution to the extension equations
for the case of the orthogonal CK algebras. The same approach can be used for
the family of quasi-unitary algebras. However, and in order not to burden the
exposition, the main details on the procedure have been placed in the Appendix.
The results obtained there give the general solution to the problem of ﬁnding the
central extensions for the unitary CK algebras. They are summed up as

Theorem 3.1
The most general central extension suω(N +1) of any algebra in the family of special
unitary CK algebras suω(N + 1) is determined by the following basic coeﬃcients:

Type I. N(N +1)/2 basic extension coeﬃcients ηab and N(N +1)/2 basic extension
coeﬃcients τab (a < b, a, b = 0, 1, . . . , N). These coeﬃcients are not subjected
to any further relationship.

Type II. N basic extension coeﬃcients αk (k = 1, . . . , N), not subjected to any

Type III. N(N −1)/2 basic extension coeﬃcients βkl (k < l, k, l = 1, . . . , N) which

further relationship.

must satisfy the conditions

ωkβkl = 0

ωlβkl = 0.

(3.6)

Theorem 3.2
The most general central extension uω(N +1) of any algebra in the unitary CK family
uω(N + 1), is determined by the basic extension coeﬃcients given in Theorem 3.1,
and by an additional set of

Type III. N basic extension coeﬃcients γk (k = 1, . . . , N), subjected to the rela-

tion

ωkγk = 0.

(3.7)

For any given choice of the constants ωa, these basic extension coeﬃcients determine
two-cocycles for the algebras suω(N + 1) and uω(N + 1). The Lie brackets of the
extended algebras suω(N + 1) and uω(N + 1) are given by

[Jab, Jac] = ωab(Jbc + ηbcΞ)

The complete expression for the two-cocycles for suω(N + 1) and uω(N + 1) can
be read directly from these commutators; for future convenience, we collect some
expressions relating the basic extension coeﬃcients with particular values of the
two-cocycles determining the extensions (however, and as it can be seen in (3.8),
most of these basic coeﬃcients appears related to the values of the cocycle in several
ways)

ηac = −ξ(Jab, Jbc)
αk = ξ(Jk−1 k, Mk−1 k)

τac = −ξ(Jab, Mbc)
βkl = ξ(Bk, Bl)

γk = ξ(Bk, I).

(3.11)

3.2 Equivalence of extensions

According to the general discussion in the beginning of this section, we now look
for the more general coboundary for suω(N + 1) or uω(N + 1). We write a change
of basis (see (3.3)) for the generators as

Jab → J ′

ab = Jab + σabΞ Mab → M ′

ab = Mab + ρabΞ Bk → B′

k = Bk + υkΞ (3.12)

10

I → I + ςΞ

(3.13)

where σab, ρab, υk, ς are the values of µ on the generators Jab, Mab, Bk, I. By
using (3.5) and the structure constants of the algebras suω(N + 1) or uω(N + 1) read
from (2.8)–(2.10), we ﬁnd for the associated coboundaries δµ,

δµ(Jab, Jbc) = −σac
δµ(Jk−1 k, Mk−1 k) = −2ωkυk

δµ(Jab, Mbc) = −ρac
δµ(Bk, Bl) = 0

δµ(Bk, I) = 0 .

(3.14)

(3.15)

We shall not need the remaining values of the coboundaries δµ for suω(N + 1) or
uω(N + 1); each δµ being a two-cocycle, it must necessarily appear as a particular
case of the most general two-cocycles which are completely determined by the basic
extension coeﬃcients (3.10).

The question of whether a general two-cocycle for a CK algebra in Theorem 3.1
deﬁnes a trivial extension amounts to checking whether it is a coboundary, which
will allow to eliminate the central Ξ term from (3.8). This may depend on the values
of the constants ωa. In fact, the three types of extensions behave in three diﬀerent
ways, which mimics the pattern found in the orthogonal case [1]:

• Type I extensions can be done for all unitary CK algebras, since there is not
any ωa-dependent restriction to the basic Type I coeﬃcients τab, ηab. How-
ever, as seen in (3.14), these extensions are always trivial. A considerable
simpliﬁcation of all expressions can be gained if these trivial extensions are
simply discarded, as we shall do from now on. Hence for the extended algebra,
the whole block of commutation relations in (2.8) will hold and only those
commutators in (2.9) or (2.10) may change.

• Type II extensions appear also in all unitary CK algebras, as there is not any
ωa-dependent restriction to the basic Type II coeﬃcients αk. The triviality of
these extensions is ωa-dependent, and (3.14) shows that the extension deter-
mined by the coeﬃcient αk is non-trivial if ωk = 0, and trivial otherwise. It is
within this type of extensions that a pseudoextension (trivial extension by a
two-coboundary) may become a non-trivial extension by contraction [14, 15].

• Type III extensions behave in a completely diﬀerent way. Due to the additional
conditions (3.6) and (3.7) that Type III extension coeﬃcients must fulﬁl, some
of them might be necessarily equal to zero. Hence, these extensions do not
exist for all unitary CK algebras. But those allowed (one βkl for each pair of
vanishing constants ωk = ωl = 0 and for the (non-special) unitary case one
additional γk for each vanishing constant ωk = 0) are always non-trivial, as
the last equation in (3.14) and (3.15) show. Therefore, Type III extensions do
not appear through the pseudoextension mechanism.

3.3 The second cohomology groups of the unitary CK alge-

bras

If we disregard Type I extensions, which are trivial for all members in the two CK
families of unitary algebras, the above results can be summarised in the following

Theorem 3.3
The commutation relations of any central extension suω(N +1) of the special unitary
CK algebra suω(N +1) can be written as the commutation relations in (2.8), together
with:

b

s=a+1

[Jab, Mab] = −2ωab

ωa s−1ωsb αsΞ

[Bk, Bl] = βklΞ

k < l

which will replace those in (2.9). The extension is completely characterised by

(3.16)

• N Type II coeﬃcients αk (k = 1, . . . , N). Each of them gives rise to a non-

trivial extension if ωk = 0 and to a trivial one otherwise.

• N(N − 1)/2 Type III extension coeﬃcients βkl (k < l and k, l = 1, . . . , N),

satisfying

ωkβkl = 0

ωlβkl = 0.

(3.17)

Thus, βkl must be equal to zero when at least one of the constants ωk, ωl is
diﬀerent from zero. When βkl is non-zero, the extension that it determines is
always non-trivial.

Theorem 3.4
The commutation relations of any central extension uω(N + 1) of the unitary CK
algebra uω(N + 1) can be written as the commutation relations in the preceding
statement, together with

[Jab, I] = 0

[Mab, I] = 0

[Bk, I] = γkΞ

(3.18)

which will replace those in (2.10). In addition to the extension coeﬃcients αk and
βkl, the extension is completely characterised by

• N Type III coeﬃcients γk (k = 1, . . . , N) satisfying

ωkγk = 0.

(3.19)

When γk is non-zero, the extension that it determines is non-trivial.

All Type II extensions come from the pseudocohomology mechanism [14, 15].

We can write (3.16) as

[Jab, Mab] = −2ωab

(Bs −

(3.20)

which is well deﬁned even if any of the ωs (s = a+1, a+2, . . . , b) is equal to zero. This
clearly shows that when a given ωs is diﬀerent from zero, the extension coeﬃcient αs
gives rise to a trivial extension, which can be removed by the one-cochain µ(Bs) =
− αs
2ωs (all other coordinates of the one-cochain being zero). However, when ωs goes
to zero, the corresponding extension is non-trivial, as the cochain deﬁned above
diverges, but the term ωab/ωs in (3.20) does not.

In terms of the triangular arrangement for the generators of suω(N + 1) (see
Fig. 2.1), it is also worth remarking that Type III extensions only aﬀect the com-
mutators of the Cartan generators in the outermost ‘B’ diagonal, while the Type II
extension αa only modiﬁes the commutators of each those pairs {Jij, Mij} ≡ Xij
with i < a ≤ j, i.e. those pairs contained inside a rectangle with left-down corner
Xa−1a.

As a by-product of these results we can give closed expressions for the dimension

of the second cohomology group of any Lie algebra in the unitary CK families.

Proposition 3.1
Let suω(N + 1) or uω(N + 1) be a Lie algebra belonging to a family of unitary CK
algebras, and let n be the number of coeﬃcients ωk equal to zero. The dimension of
its second cohomology group is given by

dim (H 2(suω(N + 1), R) = n +

dim (H 2(uω(N + 1), R) = n +

n(n − 1)
2

=

n(n + 1)
2

n(n − 1)
2

+ n =

n(n + 3)
2

.

(3.21)

(3.22)

The ﬁrst term n in the sum of (3.21), (3.22) corresponds to the central extensions
αk, the second term n(n−1)
to the βkl and the third term n in (3.22) to the central
extensions γk. We recall that the analogous expression for the quasi-orthogonal case
is far more complicated, and depends not only on the number of constants equal to
zero, but also on the detailed arrangement of zeros in the sequence ω1, . . . , ωN [1].

2

As expected for the simple su(p, q) or the semisimple u(p, q) algebras, which
appear within the two unitary CK families when all ωa 6= 0, the second cohomology
group is trivial. The inhomogeneous iu(p, q) algebras, appearing in the special
unitary family when either ω1 = 0 or ωN = 0, with all other constants ωa 6= 0, have,
in any dimension, a single non-trivial extension: α1 when ω1 = 0 or αN if ωN = 0.
The special unitary ﬂag algebra (when all ωa = 0) has the maximum number of
non-trivial extensions within the special unitary family, that is, N(N + 1)/2.

4 Examples

Let us illustrate the general results of the above section for the suω(N + 1) algebras
in the three lowest dimensional cases, N = 1, 2, 3. A completely similar discussion
can be performed for the uω(N + 1) algebras.

13

4.1 suω1(2)

We simply mention this example for the sake of completeness. The results for the ex-
tensions of suω1(2) could be also obtained from those in [1] by using the isomorphism
suω1(2) ≃ soω1,+(3, R) provided by J01/2 ↔ Ω01, M01/2 ↔ Ω02, −B1/2 ↔ Ω12. The
most general extension is deﬁned by the extension coeﬃcient α1 and the non-zero
Lie brackets

[J01, M01] = −2ω1B1 + α1Ξ

[J01, B1] = 2M01

[M01, B1] = −2J01.

(4.1)

The extension is non-trivial for ω1 = 0 and trivial otherwise, the triviality being
exhibited by the redeﬁnition

B1 → B1 −

α1
2ω1

Ξ.

4.2 suω1,ω2(3)

The most general extended special unitary CK algebra suω1,ω2(3) has nine genera-
tors {J01, J02, J12, M01, M02, M12, B1, B2, Ξ}, and it is determined by three possible
extension coeﬃcients {α1, α2, β12}, with ω1β12 = ω2β12 = 0. Their commutators are:

[J01, J02] = ω1J12
[M01, M02] = ω1J12
[J01, M02] = ω1M12
[M01, J02] = −ω1M12
[J01, B1] = 2M01
[J01, B2] = −M01
[M01, B1] = −2J01
[M01, B2] = J01

[J01, J12] = −J02
[M01, M12] = J02
[J01, M12] = −M02
[M01, J12] = −M02
[J02, B1] = M02
[J02, B2] = M02
[M02, B1] = −J02
[M02, B2] = −J02

[J02, J12] = ω2J01
[M02, M12] = ω2J01
[J02, M12] = −ω2M01
[M02, J12] = ω2M01
[J12, B1] = −M12
[J12, B2] = 2M12
[M12, B1] = J12
[M12, B2] = −2J12

[J01, M01] = −2ω1B1 + α1Ξ
[J02, M02] = ω2(−2ω1B1 + α1Ξ) + ω1(−2ω2B2 + α2Ξ)
[B1, B2] = β12Ξ.

[J12, M12] = −2ω2B2 + α2Ξ

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

The triviality of Type II extensions is governed by the values of the constants
ω1, ω2. We analyse this problem for each speciﬁc CK algebra within suω1,ω2(3). The
extension determined by α1 is trivial when ω1 6= 0, and the extension determined
by α2 is trivial when ω2 6= 0, the triviality being exhibited by the redeﬁnitions

B1 → B1 −

B2 → B2 −

(4.5)

α1
2ω1

Ξ

α2
2ω2

Ξ.

Thus, dim (H 2(suω1,ω2(3), R)) is equal to

• 0 when both ω1, ω2 6= 0. Here both α1, α2 produce trivial extensions, and β12
must vanish. This case corresponds to the extensions of su(3) for (ω1, ω2) =
(+, +), and su(2, 1) for (ω1, ω2) = {(+, −), (−, +), (−, −)} and the result is in
agreement with Whitehead’s lemma, according to which simple algebras have
no non-trivial extensions.

14

• 1 for the inhomogeneous unitary algebras iu(2) and iu(1, 1). These algebras
appear twice in the CK family, namely for ω1 = 0, ω2 6= 0 and for ω1 6=
0, ω2 = 0. In the ﬁrst case the only non-trivial extension coeﬃcient is α1 and
the extended Lie brackets (4.4) reduce to

[J01, M01] = α1Ξ [J02, M02] = ω2α1Ξ [J12, M12] = −2ω2B2

[B1, B2] = 0.

(4.6)
The second case is related to the former one due to the isomorphism (2.19).
Here there is a single non-trivial extension coeﬃcient α2 and the extended Lie
brackets are

[J01, M01] = −2ω1B1

[J02, M02] = ω1α2Ξ [J12, M12] = α2Ξ [B1, B2] = 0.

(4.7)

• 3 for the special unitary ﬂag algebra su0,0(3) when ω1 = ω2 = 0. The three

extensions are non-trivial

[J01, M01] = α1Ξ [J02, M02] = 0 [J12, M12] = α2Ξ [B1, B2] = β12Ξ.

(4.8)

4.3 suω1,ω2,ω3(4)

We consider now the extensions suω1,ω2,ω3(4) of the CK algebra suω1,ω2,ω3(4). There
are six possible basic extension coeﬃcients, {α1, α2, α3, β12, β13, β23}, which must
satisfy the conditions

ω1β12 = ω2β12 = 0

ω1β13 = ω3β13 = 0

ω2β23 = ω3β23 = 0,

(4.9)

and the Lie brackets of the extension are given by the non-extended ones in (2.8)
and by the extended ones

[J01, M01] = −2ω1B1 + α1Ξ
[J02, M02] = ω2(−2ω1B1 + α1Ξ) + ω1(−2ω2B2 + α2Ξ)
[J03, M03] = ω2ω3(−2ω1B1 + α1Ξ) + ω1ω3(−2ω2B2 + α2Ξ)

+ω1ω2(−2ω3B3 + α3Ξ)

[J12, M12] = −2ω2B2 + α2Ξ
[J13, M13] = ω3(−2ω2B2 + α2Ξ) + ω2(−2ω3B3 + α3Ξ)
[J23, M23] = −2ω3B3 + α3Ξ
[B1, B2] = β12Ξ

[B1, B3] = β13Ξ

[B2, B3] = β23Ξ.

(4.10)

The results for each one of the 27 CK algebras suω1,ω2,ω3(4) are displayed in
Table 4.1. The columns in this Table show, in this order, the number of coeﬃcients
ωa set equal to zero (number of contractions), the centrally extended Lie algebras,
the signs +, −, 0 of each coeﬃcient (ω1, ω2, ω3) together with the non-trivial central
extensions allowed for the algebra with these signs for the coeﬃcients, and ﬁnally,
the dimension of the second cohomology group as a sum of the number of non-
trivial extensions of Types II and III, coming respectively from the coeﬃcients αk
and βkl. In the table + (−) denotes a positive (negative) ωa coeﬃcient which could
be rescaled to 1 (−1).

5 Conclusions and outlook

We restrict here to a couple of remarks. First, the pattern of three types of exten-
sions behaving under contractions in three diﬀerent ways, ﬁrst found for the quasi-
orthogonal family [1], appears also in the quasi-unitary case. This seems likely to
be a general phenomenon, not restricted to a single family of contractions of some
Lie algebras. The analysis of the extensions for the third CK main series of alge-
bras, which embraces the symplectic sp(p, q) in the Cl series and their contractions,
would be required to complete the study of the relationships between cohomology
and contractions undertaken in [1] and continued in this paper. These algebras can
be adequately realised by quaternionic antihermitian matrices, or, alternatively, by
quaternionic antihermitian traceless matrices plus the Lie algebra of derivations of
the quaternion division algebra. Work in this area is in progress. Second, as com-
pared to the quasi-orthogonal case, the quasi-unitary algebras have a comparatively
smaller set of extensions, whose description in terms of the values taken by the
CK constants ωa is straightforward. The suitability of a CK approach to the study
of the central extensions of a complete family is therefore put forward more clearly
than in the orthogonal case. While the ordinary inhomogeneous orthogonal algebras
iso(p, q) associated to the real orthogonal N = p + q dimensional ﬂat spaces have
non-trivial extensions only in the case N = 2, the algebras iu(p, q) associated to the
complex pseudo-Euclidean hermitian ﬂat spaces have a single non-trivial extension,
in any dimension. The relevance of this fact in relation with the classical limit of
quantum mechanics will be discussed elsewhere.

Appendix: The general solution to the Jacobi iden-
tities

In order to get the general solution of the set of linear equations determining the
possible extensions of the unitary CK algebras, we ﬁrst introduce a suitable notation
for the central extension coeﬃcients, which is ‘adapted’ to the structure of the
algebras suω(N + 1) (2.8)–(2.9) and uω(N + 1) (2.8)–(2.10) whose basic generators
come naturally divided in either three or four ‘kinds’ Jab, Mab, Bk, I. The symbol
corresponding to ξ(X, Y ) will have one or two letters taken from j, m, b, i, determined
by the kind of the basis generators X, Y . To this symbol we append two groups of
indices, each coming from those of the corresponding generators. The complete list
of all extension coeﬃcients as written in this notation is

jab,de

where we implicitly assume a < b, d < e, a, b, d, e = 0, . . . N, k < l, k, l = 1, . . . N.
We remark that jm, mj, jb, mb, ji, mi, bi are single, unbreakable symbols, and
are not products. In the course of the derivation we will ﬁnd useful to sort these
coeﬃcients into several subsets, as follows

• Coeﬃcients jab,de, mab,de, jmab,de, mjab,de involving four diﬀerent indices. If

we write these four indices as a < b < c < d the coeﬃcients are

• Coeﬃcients jab,de, mab,de, jmab,de, mjab,de involving three diﬀerent indices. If we

write the three indices as a < b < c these coeﬃcients are

Our strategy here will be to enforce the complete set of Jacobi identities ﬁrst
for suω(N + 1) and then for uω(N + 1), in a carefully selected order which actually
allows to explicitly solve the rather large set of linear equations. The ﬁrst stage will
be to identify many extension coeﬃcients which are forced to vanish; the remaining
Jacobi equations will drastically simplify and will either produce relations allowing
to express certain derived extension coeﬃcients in terms of the so-called basic ones,
or further relations to be satisﬁed by the basic extension coeﬃcients.

To begin with, we show that all coeﬃcients in (A.2) vanish. Denoting by
{X, Y, Z} the Jacobi identity for the generators X, Y and Z, we display several
choices for them and the equations ensuing from these choices:

{Jab, Mcd, Bd} :

ωbcjmab,cd − mjac,bd + jmad,bc = 0.

By substituting (A.14) and (A.15) in (A.16), we ﬁnd that all coeﬃcients in (A.2)
are necessarily equal to zero. From now on, substitution of the already known
information in further equations will be automatically assumed.

The coeﬃcients in (A.6) turn out to be also equal to zero:

{Mab, Bb, Bj} : jbab,j = 0 {Jab, Bb, Bj} : mbab,j = 0 j /∈ {a, a + 1, b, b + 1}.

Now we look for equations involving the coeﬃcients bk,l in (A.7). We ﬁnd:

{Ja a+1, Ma a+1, Bk} : ωa a+1bk,a+1 = 0
{Jb−1 b, Mb−1 b, Bl} :

ωb−1 bbb,l = 0

1 ≤ k ≤ a
b + 1 ≤ l ≤ N

a = 1, . . . , N − 1
b = 1, . . . , N − 1

(A.18)
so the N(N − 1)/2 coeﬃcients of the type bk,l might be diﬀerent from zero. We
denote them as

and from (A.18) they must fulﬁl two additional conditions

βkl := bk,l

19

ωkβkl = 0

ωlβkl = 0.

We now look for Jacobi identities involving the extension coeﬃcients in (A.5):

{Mab, Ba, Ba+1} :
{Mab, Ba, Bb} :
{Mab, Ba, Bb+1} :
{Mab, Ba+1, Bb} :
{Mab, Ba+1, Bb+1} :
{Mab, Bb, Bb+1} :

jbab,a+1 = jbab,a
jbab,b = jbab,a
jbab,b+1 = jbab,a
jbab,a+1 = jbab,b
jbab,a+1 = jbab,b+1
jbab,b = jbab,b+1

{Jab, Ba, Ba+1} : mbab,a+1 = mbab,a
{Jab, Ba, Bb} :
{Jab, Ba, Bb+1} :
{Jab, Ba+1, Bb} :
{Jab, Ba+1, Bb+1} : mbab,a+1 = mbab,b+1
{Jab, Bb, Bb+1} :

mbab,b = mbab,a
mbab,b+1 = mbab,a
mbab,a+1 = mbab,b

mbab,b = mbab,b+1

which hold no matter of either b = a + 1 or b 6= a + 1. These equations show that

jbab,a = jbab,a+1 = jbab,b = jbab,b+1
mbab,a = mbab,a+1 = mbab,b = mbab,b+1

and therefore these coeﬃcients only depend on the ﬁrst pair of indices. These
common values must be considered as another set of basic coeﬃcients

τab := jbab,i

ηab := mbab,i

i ∈ {a, a + 1, b, b + 1}.

(A.23)

Now we consider Jacobi identities leading to equations which involve the coeﬃ-
cients in (A.3), those jab,de, mab,de, jmab,de, mjab,de with three diﬀerent indices. This
is the most tedious part of the process, due to the need of paying minute attention
to the index ranges. Let us ﬁrst look for equations involving the coeﬃcients with
indices {ab, bc}, which appear in the middle line of (A.3)

{Jab, Mbc, Bc+1} :
{Jab, MbN , BN } :
{Ja N −1, MN −1 N , Ba} :
{J0 N −1, MN −1 N , B1} :
{Mab, Jbc, Bc+1} :
{Mab, JbN , BN } :
{MaN −1, JN −1N , Ba} :
{M0N −1, JN −1N , B1} :

{Jab, Jbc, Bc+1} :
{Jab, JbN , BN } :
{Ja N −1, JN −1 N , Ba} :
{J0 N −1, JN −1 N , B1} :
{Mab, Mbc, Bc+1} :
{Mab, MbN , BN } :
{MaN −1, MN −1N , Ba} :
{M0N −1, MN −1N , B1} :

jab,bc = ηac
jab,bN = ηaN
ma N −1,N −1 N = ηaN
m0 N −1,N −1 N = η0N
mab,bc = ηac
mab,bN = ηaN
jaN −1,N −1N = ηaN
j0N −1,N −1N = η0N

jmab,bc = τac
jmab,bN = τaN
mja N −1,N −1 N = τaN
mj0 N −1,N −1 N = τ0N
mjab,bc = τac
mjab,bN = τaN
jmaN −1,N −1N = τaN
jm0N −1,N −1N = τ0N ,

c < N
b < N − 1
a > 0

c < N
b < N − 1
a > 0

c < N
b < N − 1
a > 0

c < N
b < N − 1
a > 0

so in all cases, and no matter on the value of the middle index b, we have

jab,bc = mab,bc = ηac

jmab,bc = mjab,bc = τac.

(A.26)

(A.21)

(A.22)

(A.24)

(A.25)

For the coeﬃcients in the ﬁrst line of (A.3) we obtain that

{Jab, Mac, Bc+1} :
{Jab, MaN , BN } :
{Ja N −1, MaN , BN −1} :
{Mab, Jac, Bc+1} :
{Mab, JaN , BN } :
{MaN −1, JaN , BN −1} :
{JN −2 N −1, MN −2 N , BN −1} :

jab,ac = ωabηbc
jab,aN = ωabηbN
ma N −1,aN = ωaN −1ηN −1 N
mab,ac = ωabηbc
mab,aN = ωabηbN
jaN −1,aN = ωaN −1ηN −1 N

c < N
b < N − 1
a < N − 2
c < N
b < N − 1
a < N − 2

jN −2 N −1,N −2 N + ωN −2 N −1ηN −1 N − 2mN −2 N −1,N −2 N = 0

{MN −2 N −1, JN −2 N , BN −1} :

−2jN −2 N −1,N −2 N + ωN −2 N −1ηN −1 N + mN −2 N −1,N −2 N = 0

{Jab, Jac, Bc+1} :
{Jab, JaN , BN } :
{Ja N −1, JaN , BN −1} :
{Mab, Mac, Bc+1} :
{Mab, MaN , BN } :
{MaN −1, MaN , BN −1} :
{JN −2 N −1, JN −2 N , BN −1} :

jmab,ac = ωabτbc
jmab,aN = ωabτbN
mja N −1,aN = ωaN −1τN −1 N
mjab,ac = ωabτbc
mjab,aN = ωabτbN
jmaN −1,aN = ωaN −1τN −1 N

c < N
b < N − 1
a < N − 2
c < N
b < N − 1
a < N − 2

jmN −2 N −1,N −2 N + ωN −2 N −1τN −1 N + 2mjN −2 N −1,N −2 N = 0

{MN −2 N −1, MN −2 N , BN −1} :

−2jmN −2 N −1,N −2 N + ωN −2 N −1τN −1 N − mjN −2 N −1,N −2 N = 0 .

These equations are summarised in

jab,ac = mab,ac = ωabηbc

jmab,ac = mjab,ac = ωabτbc

(A.29)

so again these are derived extension coeﬃcients, expressible in terms of ηbc and τbc.

For the coeﬃcients in the third line of (A.3) with indices {ac, bc} we get

{Jac, Mbc, Ba} :
{J0c, Mbc, B1} :
{J0c, M1c, B2} :
{Mac, Jbc, Ba} :
{M0c, Jbc, B1} :
{M0c, J1c, B2} :
{J02, M12, B2} :
{M02, J12, B2} :

mac,bc = ωbcηab
m0c,bc = ωbcη0b
j0c,1c = ω1cη01
jac,bc = ωbcηab
j0c,bc = ωbcη0b
m0c,1c = ω1cη01
−2j02,12 + ω12η01 + m02,12 = 0
2m02,12 − ω12η01 − j02,12 = 0

a > 0
b > 1
c > 2
a > 0
b > 1
c > 2

{Jac, Jbc, Ba} :
{J0c, Jbc, B1} :
{J0c, J1c, B2} :
{Mac, Mbc, Ba} :
{M0c, Mbc, B1} :
{M0c, M1c, B2} :
{J02, J12, B2} :
{M02, M12, B2} :

mjac,bc = ωbcτab
mj0c,bc = ωbcτ0b
jm0c,1c = ω1cτ01
jmac,bc = ωbcτab
jm0c,bc = ωbcτ0b
mj0c,1c = ω1cτ01
2jm02,12 − ω12τ01 − mj02,12 = 0
−jm02,12 − ω12τ01 + 2mj02,12 = 0.

a > 0
b > 1
c > 2
a > 0
b > 1
c > 2

(A.27)

(A.28)

(A.30)

(A.31)

These equations lead to

jac,bc = mac,bc = ωbcηab

jmac,bc = mjac,bc = ωbcτab ,

(A.32)

so these coeﬃcients are also derived.

Finally we look for equations involving the coeﬃcients in (A.4), this is jmac.

Whenever there exists an index b between a and c, the choice

{Jab, Jac, Mbc} :

jmac = ωbcjmab + ωabjmbc

(A.33)

leads to an expression for jmac in terms of jmab and jmbc. By iterating while
possible, we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcients jmac with a and c not contiguous can be
written in terms of jmab with a and b contiguous. These must be considered as
basic ones

αk := jmk−1 k

k = 1, . . . , N ,

(A.34)

and the remaining coeﬃcients in (A.4) are given, recalling that ωii ≡ 1, by

jmab =

ωa s−1ωsb αs

b ≥ a + 2.

(A.35)

b

X
s=a+1

As far as suω(N + 1) is concerned, the ﬁnal step in this process is to ascertain
that there is no any relation for the extensions coeﬃcients further to the ones yet
considered.
It can be checked that all remaining Jacobi equations involving the
generators Jab, Mab, Bl are identically satisﬁed, so the process has indeed terminated.

Now we deal with the uω(N + 1) case; as Jacobi equations involving Jab, Mab, Bl
have been already considered, we must take into account only the extra generator I
and the associated extension coeﬃcients. For these, successively we obtain

{Jab, Bb, I} :
{Mab, Bb, I} :
{Jk−1k, Mk−1k, I} :

miab = 0
jiab = 0
ωkbik = 0

so the extension coeﬃcients in (A.8) are equal to zero, and those in (A.9) are basic,
to be denoted as

(A.36)

(A.37)

(A.38)

Again in this case, it is easy to check that all remaining Jacobi equations involving

the generator I are satisﬁed and do not lead to any further relation.

and must satisfy

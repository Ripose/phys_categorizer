Spontaneous potentials associated with volcanic activity are often interpreted by means of
the electrokinetic potential, which is usually positive in the ﬂow direction (i.e. Zeta potential
of the rock is negative). The water–rock interactions in hydrothermal zones alter the primary
minerals leading to the formation of secondary minerals. This work addresses the study of
calcite precipitation in a sand composed of 98 per cent quartz and 2 per cent calcite using
streaming potential measurements. The precipitation of calcite as a secondary mineral phase,
inferred by high calcite saturation indices and by a fall in permeability, has a signiﬁcant effect
on the electrokinetic behaviour, leading to a signiﬁcant reduction in the Zeta potential (in
absolute value) and even a change in sign.

The measured decrease in Zeta potential from −16 mV to −27 ± 4 mV takes place as the pH
rises from 4 to 7, while it remains constant at −25 ± 1 mV as the pH increases from 8 to 10.5.
For pH higher than 10.5, calcite precipitates and is expected to coat the quartz surface. The
measured Zeta potential vary from −17 to +8 mV for pH ranging from 10.6 to 11.7 depending
on the amount of precipitated calcite indicated by the decrease in permeability.

The observed change in sign of the electrical surface potential rules out the usual qualitative
interpretation of SP anomalies in order to determine ﬂuid circulations, even at pH lower than 9
if calcite is widely present as a secondary mineral phase, since the electrical surface potential of
calcite depends also on CO2 partial pressure and [Ca2+]. Therefore, SP anomalies as measured
in hydrothermal ﬁeld, without mineralogical analyses of hydrothermal deposits, and without
geochemical ﬂuid survey, should be interpreted with caution.

Spontaneous potential (SP) is an electrical geophysical method that
measures naturally occurring voltage ﬁelds on the Earth’s surface.
Measurements of SP in the ﬁeld are performed in various differ-
ent geophysical contexts and are often interpreted by means of the
electrokinetic or streaming potential, which represents the electri-
cal potential induced by ﬂuid ﬂow through rock. In tectonically
active zones, SP anomalies may be explained by a mechanism in-
volving ﬂuid movements between reservoirs triggered by strain per-
turbations (Bernard 1992), or by changes in pore pressure in fault
zones (Fenoglio et al. 1995). The negative anomalies observed on
the ﬂanks of volcanoes are interpreted in terms of downward per-
colating rainfall, and can be linked to the depth of the water ta-
ble (Zablocki 1978; Aubert et al. 1993). The positive anomalies

observed in active volcanic areas originate from upward convective
ﬂows (Zablocki 1978; Aubert & Kieffer 1984), and are used to de-
ﬁne hydrothermal zones (Corwin & Hoover 1979; Ishido et al. 1997;
Michel & Zlotnicki 1998; L´enat et al. 2000; Finizola et al. 2002,
2003, 2004; Hase et al. 2005). Recent experiments have demon-
strated that time variations of SP can be unambiguously identiﬁed
and associated with time-varying ﬂuid ﬂow in geophysical systems
from metric to kilometric scales (Perrier et al. 1998; Doussan et al.
2002; Pinettes et al. 2002; Trique et al. 2002), thanks to the im-
provement in long-term monitoring SP (Perrier et al. 1997; Perrier
& Pant 2005). Electroseismic surveys are also based on electroki-
netic phenomena and can be used to detect small changes in rock
properties at interfaces, such as permeability and saturation state
(Bordes et al. 2006; Garambois & Dietrich 2001, 2002; Beamish
the borehole electrokinetic response due to
1999). Moreover,

water injection (Marquis et al. 2002; Darnet et al. 2004) can yield an
estimate of the fracture aperture (Hunt & Worthington 2000) or per-
meability (Murakami et al. 2001); and the inversion of SP anomalies
(Gibert & Pessel 2001; Sailhac & Marquis 2001; Sailhac et al. 2004)
can yield an estimate of aquifer hydraulic properties (Darnet et al.
2003). Measurements of SP have also been used in karst areas in
the detection of groundwater ﬂows (Erchul & Slifer 1987; Wanfang
et al. 1999). Modelling of all these observations requires a good
understanding of electrokinetic phenomena. We emphasize that it is
fundamental to check for the presence of calcite in order to interpret
ﬁeld measurements of SP, such as in the case of streaming poten-
tials in underground limestone quarries (Morat et al. 1995) or for
the preservation of historical monuments (Pisarenko et al. 1996).
Indeed the presence of calcite can induce a change in the stream-
ing potential sign, which is generally positive in the ﬂow direction
(Ishido & Mizutani 1981; Jouniaux & Pozzi 1995a, 1997; Guichet
et al. 2003; Maineult et al. 2004).

In hydrothermal areas, interaction between hot waters and the
rocks through which they migrate alters the primary minerals and
leads to the formation of secondary minerals. These processes result
in changes in physical and chemical properties of the system. Karst
areas are generally underlain by soluble calcareous rocks. Sinkholes,
caves, result from dissolution of primary rocks. Sealing of fractured
rocks can also occur, resulting in the precipitation of secondary
minerals. Davis & Kent (1990) reported that the surface chemical
properties of natural materials are modiﬁed by secondary minerals
that are usually present as a minor fraction of the whole sample. We
decided to focus our attention on calcite as a secondary mineral,
because (i) Calcite is a common mineral constituent of limestones,
and is a secondary mineral in numerous geological contexts, and
(ii) the electrical properties of the calcite–water interface is still a
controversial topic.

(i)

In natural geophysical systems, calcite is a common mineral
phase, modifying ground- and surface-water compositions. It acts as
a buffer for pH in ground and surface waters, being able to modify the
water chemistry because of its low solubility and rapid precipitation–
dissolution kinetics (Langmuir 1971; Sigg et al. 2000). Waters in or
close to equilibrium with calcite contain large amounts of Ca2+ and
HCO−
3 ; to a ﬁrst approximation the concentration of HCO−
3 is twice
the concentration of Ca2+ (Sigg et al. 2000). Many natural rivers
show a calcite oversaturation with a CO2 partial pressure ranging
from atmospheric CO2 partial pressure to 10−2 atm (Fig. 1). Thus,
calcite acts as a buffer for many natural waters, and is expected to
precipitate in many natural systems.

Calcite is present as a secondary mineral phase in volcanic ter-
rains; Deutsch et al. (1982) showed that the water properties of
the Columbia plateau basalt aquifer are determined by secondary
calcite and Robert (2001) observed calcite in basalts from North-
ern Ireland, while Stoffers & Botz (1994) showed calcite forma-
tion associated with hydrothermal ﬂuids emerging from the ﬂoor of
Lake Tanganyika. In general the precipitation of secondary phases
during the alteration of volcanic rocks is related to the thermal
behaviour of the hydrothermal system. With decreasing tempera-
ture, the following crystallization sequence is observed: smectite
→ zeolite → calcite. These observations are based on ﬁeld studies
(Westercamp 1981; Robert et al. 1988) and also on experimental
results (Robert & Goff´e 1993). (Henley & Ellis 1983) gave a sum-
mary of the temperature range over which calcite alteration mineral
has been observed in high-temperature hydrothermal systems asso-
ciated with volcanism; calcite alteration mineral occurs from 100◦C
up to 300◦C.

(ii) Geochemists have investigated sorption processes onto cal-
cite surfaces (Douglas & Walker 1950; Foxall et al. 1979; Zachara
et al. 1991; Cicerone et al. 1992), as well as interactions at the
molecular scale (Stipp & Hochella 1991). Nevertheless, the elec-
trical properties of the calcite–water interface is still a controver-
sial topic (Fig. 2), and the calcite surface reactions appear to be
more complex than those involving silicates. Electrokinetic mea-
surements are sometimes contradictory, yielding different results
on natural calcite and on synthetic calcite, as well as depending
on CO2 partial pressure. For example in natural systems, the Ca2+
concentration ranges from 10−2 to 10−4 mol l−1 for systems where
calcite acts as a buffer (Sigg et al. 2000). Measured calcite ζ po-
tential ranges from 17 mV to −11 mV, while Ca2+ concentration
ranges from 10−2 to 10−3.3 mol L−1 (Cicerone et al. 1992).

The two last decades, laboratory measurements have been per-
formed to understand the variations of the streaming potential in
ﬂuid chemistry for various silicate minerals (Ishido & Mizutani
1981; Jouniaux & Pozzi 1995b; Lorne et al. 1999a,b; Pengra et al.
1999; Jouniaux et al. 2000; Guichet & Zuddas 2003; Guichet et al.
2003; Perrier & Froidefond 2003; Maineult et al. 2005; Lorne et al.
1999a) also reported the streaming potentials of four carbonate rocks
at pH 8. However, it is surprising that the effect of secondary min-
erals in electrokinetic properties has not been studied. Modelling
of SP observations in either hydrothermal or karst areas requires a
good understanding of electrokinetic phenomena in dynamic sys-
tems where dissolution/precipitation can occur. In this study, we
report streaming potential measurements on sand and show that
precipitation of calcite as a secondary mineral phase has a signiﬁ-
cant effect on the electrokinetic behaviour: that is, the ζ -potential is
reduced signiﬁcantly (in absolute value) and can even change sign.
Finally our measured surface potentials are compared to calculated
surface potentials using a triple-layer model (TLM).

2.1 Electrical measurements

We performe laboratory streaming potential measurements of a sand
composed of 98 per cent quartz and 2 per cent calcite using CaCl2
solutions made up in distilled water for pH in the range 4-12. The
sand is sieved, yielding a grain size ranging from 100 × 10−6 m
to 500 × 10−6 m. Experiments are carried out at room temper-
ature, which varies from 14.9◦C to 19.5◦C. A solution of CaCl2,
5 × 10−4 mol l−1 is then prepared. The water used for making all
solutions is freshly distilled with a MilliQ system. The solutions are
made up and stored in glassware, thus atmospheric CO2 does not
equilibrate with the solution, which remains undersaturated with re-
spect to atmospheric CO2. Electrical surface potential of calcite can
range from positive to negative values depending on CO2 partial
pressure, pH, and [Ca2+] (Pokrovsky et al. 1999). At the atmo-
spheric CO2partial pressure a pH corresponding to a zero surface
charge can be observed. Since we do not observe any point of zero
surface charge, the CO2partial pressure of our experiments must
be lower than the atmospheric CO2partial pressure (Van Cappellen

Figure 3. The water pressure is controlled by applying compressed air to a
water reservoir at one end of the sample, while the other end is maintained at
atmospheric pressure. The electric potential difference is measured between
the ends of the sample by two silver-chloride non-polarizable electrodes:
water saturated porous ceramics are used to prevent any gas or air bubble
from being in contact with the electrode and remain saturated to keep the
electrical contact. The electrodes are placed in the water circuit near the ends
of the sample but not in the circulating water ﬂow to avoid electrical noise
due to water movement near the electrodes (Ahmad 1964). When calcite
is precipitated during the experiments, the electrical potential difference
measured by the electrodes without any ﬂuid ﬂow remains small (1–4 mV).
The two electrodes are connected by coaxial wires to a high-input impedance
voltmeter (>10 G(cid:2)). The input impedance of the voltmeter is several orders
of magnitude greater than the resistance of the sample (e.g. it is16 k(cid:2) when
water conductivity is 0.036 S m−1), thus allowing accurate measurement of
the electric potential.

et al. 1993). The pH of the solution is adjusted with Ca(OH)2 in the
range 7–11.7, and with HCl in the range 4.4–7.

The experiment setup is shown in Fig. 3. The reader can ﬁnd
a detailed description of the apparatus in (Jouniaux et al. 2000).
In a typical experiment, a 1L-aliquot of aqueous solution from the
reservoir is passed through the sample. The output solution is recir-
culated twice. Reliable measurements involve equilibrium between
sand and aqueous solution: the electrical conductivity and the pH
of the output solution are measured after the different steps of ﬂuid
circulation until the values become constant. Equilibrium is reached
after waiting 24 hr (see Appendix A for details). Before measuring
the electrokinetic coupling coefﬁcient, the 1L aliquot of aqueous so-
lution is again recirculated twice. A fraction of the output solution
is sampled for chemical analysis.

The streaming potential (cid:3)V is measured when the ﬂuid is forced
through the sample by applying a ﬂuid pressure difference (cid:3)P. To
check the linearity between the applied pressure difference (cid:3)P at
the sample ends and the measured streaming potential difference
(cid:3)V , the solution is made to ﬂow systematically with 5 pressure
steps from 0.1 to 0.5 × 105 Pa. The coupling coefﬁcient (cid:3)V /(cid:3)P
is determined from the slope of (cid:3)V against (cid:3)P (see examples in
Fig. 4). The streaming measurements are described in Section 3 and
the analysis of the effect of the precipitation of calcite as a secondary
mineral phase is made in Section 4.

The permeability of the sample is also derived using Darcy’s law.
Since the sample permeability is high, more than 10−12 m2 (see
Table 1), the aqueous solution ﬁlling the pore space can be easily
replaced through ﬂuid circulation by fresh aqueous solution having
a new pH. Experiments are performed on three samples of the same
sand. The ﬁrst sample runs are performed in the pH range from 7

to 11.7 adding Ca(OH)2; the second sample runs are performed in
the pH range 9–11.7 to have a better analysis in this range. And the
third sample runs are performed in the pH range 7–4 adding HCl
(Table 1). We do not extend these measurements to pH below 4.4 and
above 11.7, because then the ionic strength becomes signiﬁcantly
higher, and the interpretation of the experiments assuming a zeta
potential non-dependent on the electrical conductivity is no more

valid. Any decrease in permeability is thought to be related to calcite
precipitation as discussed in Section 4.

Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of the sand σ r is mea-
sured as a function of the electrical conductivity σ f of the electrolyte
in order to obtain the formation factor F(F = σ f /σ r) and the surface
electrical conductivity (see for instance: Waxman & Smits 1968).

2.2 Chemical analyses

It has been emphasized (Pokrovsky & Schott 1999) that there are
three potential-controlling parameters of the interfacial properties
of carbonates (pH, Alkalinity, [Ca2+]), and that in previous carbon-
ates electrokinetic studies, these parameters were unfortunately not
measured. Therefore, pH, alkalinity and [Ca2+] were measured on
the outﬂow solution collected after each experiment. We also mea-
sured Na+ and Cl−. A Perkin-Elmer 2380 spectrometer is used to
determine the concentations of calcium and sodium. Calcium is de-
termined by atomic absorption, and sodium by atomic emission.
A Hitachi U 1100 spectrometer is used to determine the concen-
trations of chlorine and silicon. Chlorine is determined by stable
complexation of mercury (II) thiocyanate. Silicon is determined by
complexation of molybdic silicide, while alkalinity is determined
by colorimetric titration with bromocresol green and methyl red.

2.3 ζ-potential calculations

Several models link the electrokinetic coupling coefﬁcient C s =
(cid:3)V /(cid:3)P to the physical properties of the ﬂuid, the physical prop-
erties of the porous medium and the electric surface potential. We
use the expression obtained with equation (11) from (Bussian 1983)
and equation (46) from (Revil et al. 1999b):

(1)

εζ /ησ f
1 + m(F − 1)ξ

,

Cs =

where

(i) ζ is deﬁned as the electric potential on the shear plane (the

closest plane to the rock surface over which ﬂuid is moving)

(ii) ε = ε water ε 0 is the electric permittivity of the ﬂuid with
ε water the relative dielectric constant of the ﬂuid, which is calculated
as a function of the temperature according to (Malmberg & Maryott
1956)’s law, and ε 0 = 8.84 × 10−12 F/m the electric permittivity
of vacuum, and η is the dynamic shear viscosity of the circulating
ﬂuid, which is temperature-dependent, equal to 1.01 × 10−3 Pa s at
19.5◦C and to 1.14 × 10−3 Pa s at 14.9◦C.

(iii) σ f is the electrical conductivity of the ﬂuid, and ξ = σ s/σ f

with σ s being the surface electrical conductivity of the sample.
(iv) F is the formation factor deﬁned by Archie’s ﬁrst law:

F ≡ (cid:8)−m

where (cid:8) is the porosity, and m the ﬁrst Archie’s exponent (or the

cementation exponent) of the rock.

Eq. (1) is used to derive the ζ -potential from our measurements of
coupling coefﬁcient C s. Eq. (1) is valid in the high-salinity domain,
that is, σ f ≥ 5(m −1)σ s (Bussian 1983), yielding a value equal to
the high-salinity limit in the model of Revil et al. (1999b) and is also
equivalent to the expression given by Jouniaux & Pozzi (1995a) in
the case of m being equal to 2.

since this interpretation is discussed using the permeability mea-
surements (Section 3.1), the chemical analysis (Section 3.2) and the
electrical measurements (Section 3.1).

3.1 Electrical properties and permeability of the sand

In order to determine the formation factor, the electrical conductivity
of the sand is measured as a function of water electrical conductivity
in the range 0.04–0.8 S m−1. Electrical measurements yield a forma-
tion factor, F, of 4.8. The conductivity of the electrolyte after ﬂowing
through the sample is never lower than 1.2 × 10−2 S m−1, which
prevents us from determining the electrical surface conductivity of
the sand. Revil & Glover (1998) reported a surface conductance of
8 × 10−9S for quartz, independent on the electrolyte conductivity
when this latter exceeds 10−2 S m−1. Since the electrical conductiv-
ity of the water circulating in the sand is greater than 10−2 S m−1
(see Table 1), we assume that the speciﬁc surface conductance of
the sand is 8 × 10−9 S. This is equivalent to a surface conductivity
(i.e. 2× surface conductance divided by grain radius) of about 1.06
× 10−4 S m−1 for a mean grain diameter of 300 µm, in agreement
with experimental values (Ruffet et al. 1991; Lorne et al. 1999a).
The values of formation factor and surface conductivity given here
are used in eq. (1) to obtain ζ -potentials from the electrokinetic
measurements.

Fig. 5(a) shows the variation of sample permeability as a function
of solution pH. Permeability of the samples is insensitive to pH over
the range from 4 to 9, being 4.15 ± 0.15 × 10−12 m2 for sample
1 and 4.37 ± 0.04 × 10−12 m2 for sample 2. The permeability
of sample 3 remains constant at 5.4 ± 0.2 × 10−12 m2 for a pH
range of 4.4–7.7. The permeability decreases when pH is higher
than 9. We observe that the permeability of sample 1 decreases up to
1 × 10−12 m2 at pH 11.7, and that the permeability of sample 2 falls

to 0.2 × 10−12 m2 at pH 11.7. This decrease of permeability can be
shown to be related to calcite precipitation.

Fig. 5(b) shows the variation of the aqueous solution electrical
conductivity as a function of the solution pH. The water electri-
cal conductivity measurements are shown because the ζ -potential
values are interpreted assuming a constant water conductivity. The
solution electrical conductivity is constant at about 1.55 ± 0.20 ×
10−2 S m−1 for pH in the range 5.9–10.7. Under either highly acidic
or basic conditions, the solution electrical conductivity increases up
to 7 × 10−2 S m−1 due to the addition of HCl at low pH and Ca(OH)2
at high pH. The variation of the solution electrical conductivity is
linked to the variation in the ionic strength (Fig. 5d) as calculated
from the results of the chemical analyses (Table 2) and the WATEQ
program (Plummer et al. 1976). The ionic strength is constant (I =
2 ± 0.2 × 10−3 mol l−1), while pH ranges from 5.5 to 11 except for
experiment 17 (Fig. 5d). The ionic strength of experiments 8 and
12 (the most basic experimental conditions, pH 11.7) is not given
because the electrical charge is unbalanced in this case.

Fig. 5(c) shows the variation of the ζ potential derived from eq. (1)
for pH in the range 4–12. To calculate the ζ potential, we use F =
4.8, σ s=1.06 × 10−4 S m−1 and m = 1.3, the latter being a typi-
cal value for sand (Archie 1942). The formation factor is assumed
to be constant, although it could be increased when permeabil-
ity is decreased, specially for experiment n◦12. Since the surface
conductivity is small compared to the ﬂuid conductivity, the value
of m(F −1)ξ in the eq. (1) is small compared to 1, so that the
ζ -potential derived from eq. (1) assuming a formation factor value
of 4.8, or a larger value possibly of 10, will only differ by 1 per cent.
This error has been added in Table 1. The ζ -potential decreases
from −16 to −27 ± 4 mV as the pH increases from 4 to 7. The
ζ -potential is constant at −25 ± 1 mV from pH 8 to 10.5. For solution
pH higher than 10.5, the ζ -potential is seen to increase in a less reg-
ular manner. The ζ -potential of sample 1 (experiment 7 at pH 10.7)

from 4.4 to 11, a change of sign is observed with sample 2 at pH 11.7
(experiment 12) and the ζ -potential rises to +8 mV. At pH higher
than 9, there is a decrease in the absolute value of ζ -potential, which
even leads to a change of sign. This behaviour is thought to be related
to the precipitation of calcite.

3.2 Chemical analysis

Table 2 groups together the chemical analyses of the aqueous solu-
tions. Since the initial solution is obtained by dissolving CaCl2 in
distilled water, the major cation is Ca2+ and the major anion is Cl−.
The concentration of sodium is two orders of magnitude smaller
than the concentration of calcium. We performed speciation calcu-
lations with the WATEQ program (Plummer et al. 1976), using the
revised thermodynamic database of (Ball & Nordstrom 1991). The
calculated aqueous speciation for calcium are shown in Fig. 6. For
pH lower than 9, calcium does not form any complex in solution.
In the pH range 9–12, the WATEQ calculations indicate the appear-
ance of a CaCO0
3 complex, which represents about 10 per cent of the
calcium species. These speciation calculations are used to calculate
ζ -potentials using the TLM model (Appendix B).

4 D I S C U S S I O N

We now discuss the results, in particular the behaviour of zeta po-
tential as a function of pH. We propose to interpret the measured
ζ -potentials change of sign for pH larger than 11 by the calcite pre-
cipitation, using calculations of the surface electrical potential for
both a quartz–water and a calcite–water interface.

4.1 Electrokinetic potentials

The ionic strength remains constant in the pH range 5.5–10.7
(Fig. 5d). Fig. 7 shows the evolution of ζ -potential at constant ionic
strength (I = 2 ± 0.2 × 10−3 mol l−1) as a function of pH, that
is, all experiments except n◦s 8, 12, 17, 18 and 19 (Table 1). For
comparison measurements from Lorne et al. (1999a) and Ishido &
Mizutani (1981) are plotted. In the pH range from 4 to 10.5, the
shape of the pH vs. ζ -potential dependence of our measurements
is in good agreement with the results of Lorne et al. (1999a). The
absolute values of the measurements reported by Ishido & Mizutani
(1981) are larger, and the decrease with pH is much more abrupt.
There are several possible reasons for this discrepancy:

(1) Sample preparation: Ishido & Mizutani (1981) carried out
measurements with natural quartz that was crushed and cleaned with
dilute nitric acid and then washed with distilled water. The sam-
ples were stored in distilled water for several months before being
used. Lorne et al. (1999a) carried out measurements with crushed
Fontainebleau sandstone that had not been cleaned with acid.

However, Lorne et al. (1999a) also ran an experiment with a crushed
Fontainebleau sandstone that had been cleaned with hydrochloric
acid, showing no signiﬁcant change in the measured ζ -potential.

(2) Temperature: Lorne et al. (1999a) obtained a ζ -potential of
about −25 mV at pH 6 using NaCl at 10−3 mol l−1, performing their
measurements at 22 ± 1◦C. Ishido & Mizutani (1981) measured
ζ -potentials of about −90 mV at pH 6 using KNO3 at 10−3 mol l−1,
and at a temperature of 45◦C. These authors (1981) reported that
ζ -potential decreases with increasing temperature, by about −0.65
mV/◦C at pH 6.1. This would lead to a ζ -potential of about −75 mV
at 22◦C, a value which is still far from the value measured by Lorne
et al. (1999a).

(3) Permeability: the permeability of our samples is about
5 × 10−12 m2 for pH in the range 5.5–10.5. Lorne et al. (1999a,b)
observed that the ζ -potential remains essentially constant for per-

meability ranging from 0. 01 × 10−12 m2 to 10 × 10−12 m2, but
decreases (in absolute value) at higher permeabilities. The perme-
ability of the samples studied by Ishido & Mizutani (1981) is about
100 × 10−12 m2. The discrepancy between our measurements and
those of Ishido & Mizutani (1981) may be due to different per-
meabilities of the samples as noted by Ishido & Mizutani (1981),
although the zeta potential is higher (in absolute value).

(4) Equilibrium time: Zeta-potential values deduced by Ishido
& Mizutani (1981) were obtained after waiting 5–10 hr, whereas
the values deduced by Lorne et al. (1999a) were obtained ‘when
ﬂuid conductivity was stable’, the sample could be ‘left in contact
with the electrolyte for some days’, as noted by the authors, without
giving any precise equilibrium time. It can not be concluded here
that the high values of zeta potential (in absolute value) from Ishido
& Mizutani (1981) are due to differences in equilibrium time.

The agreement of our data (using CaCl2 at 0.015 S m−1) with
those (using NaCl at 0.01 S m−1) of Lorne et al. (1999a) is quite sur-
prising because ζ -potentials obtained with divalent cations should
be twice lower than the values obtained with monovalent cations at
similar ionic strength (Lorne et al. 1999a). Our measurement per-
formed at pH 5.8 (−21 mV) is still higher than the zeta value of
−11 mV from Lorne et al. (1999a) using CaCl2 solution. Moreover,
our measurements yield a ζ -potential of −27 ± 4 mV at pH 7, which
is about twice lower in absolute terms than the data in the literature
for quartz–water interface giving values of about −70 mV at an
ionic strength of 10−3 mol l−1 (Pride & Morgan 1991), or −75 mV
(Ishido & Mizutani 1981), which can be considered consistent with
the fact that predominant cations are divalent cations in our study.
The measured ζ -potentials fall to −27 mV with increasing pH
from 4 to 7, but remain constant at −25 mV from pH 8 to 10.5.
This is surprising because the quartz surface is expected to become
more negative with increasing pH, as the number of >SiO− sites
increases. A further reason is that since the concentration of counter-
ions Ca2+ is kept constant up to pH 9 (Fig. 6), the ζ -potential should
decrease. The aqueous complex CaCO3 appears at about pH 9. Its

crushed Fontainebleau sandstone, for NaCl aqueous solutions with pH ad-
justed by adding HCl or NaOH, and for KCl aqueous solutions with pH
adjusted by adding HCl or KOH. These measurements were performed with
a constant electrolyte resistivity of 100 (cid:2).m in the case of NaCl (empty
squares) solutions (about 10−3 mol l−1) and 25.5 (cid:2) m (about 2 × 10−2 mol
l−1) in the case of KCl solutions (diamonds). Measurement using CaCl2 so-
lution is also reported (empty diamond): the inferred ζ -potential of −11 mV

abundance increases up to pH 10.5 and then stays broadly constant
at higher pH. The presence of CaCO3 aqueous complexes decreases
the amount of free Ca2+ in solution, so the measured ζ -potential
should be more negative for pH higher than 8. The constant value
of ζ -potential from pH 8 to 10.5 cannot be related to the appearance
of aqueous complexes of Ca2+.

4.2 Calcite precipitation

The measured ζ -potentials are scattered for pH higher than 10.5
(Fig. 7). We assume that this scattering is related to calcite pre-
cipitation, as inferred from saturation index calculations and from
the decrease in permeability. The values of permeability of sample

the variation in sample permeability. When the solution is oversaturated with
respect to calcite, the permeability of the sample decreases.

1 (experiment 8) and sample 2 (experiment 12), at pH 11.7, are
1.7 × 10−12 m2 and 0.2 × 10−12 m2, respectively. These two values
are smaller than the initial values obtained on sample 1 (sample 2)
4 × 10−12 m2 (4.4 × 10−12 m2) at neutral pH. This decrease in per-
meability is thought to be due to the precipitation of calcite. Using
the WATEQ program (Plummer et al. 1976) and the chemical anal-
yses of water samples in Table 2, we calculate the saturation indices
of the calcite. This index is deﬁned as the logarithm of the ionic
activities product (IAP), that is, as the product of the Ca2+ activ-
ity and the CO2−
3 activity, divided by the calcite solubility product.
Fig. 8 shows the variation of the calcite saturation index linked to
permeability as a function of pH. Since the Ca2+ activity remains
approximately constant, the increase of the saturation index with
increasing pH is related to the increase of CO2−
activity with in-
3
creasing pH (Fig. 6). The saturation index is less than 0 when pH
ranges from 4.4 to 8.4, that is, the calcite of the sample undergoes
dissolution. When pH is higher than 8.7, the saturation index is
greater than zero, calcite precipitates from the solution and the per-
meability of the sample decreases. The calcite precipitate is expected
to form a coating on the quartz grains. The higher the solution pH,
the greater the amount of precipitated calcite, because (i) the satu-
ration index increases, (ii) the duration of the experiment increases
since the same sample remains in contact with a basic pH solution.
The calcite coating gradually ﬁlls up the pore space and hydraulic
pathways.

4.3 Surface complexation model

We performed calculations of the surface electrical properties in
order to achieve a semi-quantitative description of our measure-
ments, and to investigate if calcite precipitation can lead to a
reversal of sign of the ζ -potential. The zeta potential is ﬁrst cal-
culated for a quartz–water interface, and then for a calcite–water in-
terface. The surface electrical properties of minerals are described
by surface complexation models, which are based on a descrip-
tion of the formation of complexes on the surface of minerals, that
is, between surface functional groups and dissolved species in the
electrolyte. We choose TLM because consistent parameters of the
model (i.e. capacitive constants, complexation constants) are avail-
able for numerous minerals. A mathematical description of TLM
and a review of the quartz and calcite surfaces properties are given
in Appendix B. The concentrations used for run calculations are the
output species concentrations obtained from the WATEQ program
(Plummer et al. 1976; Ball & Nordstrom 1991), using the results
from the chemical analyses of water samples (Table 2). Equilib-
rium constants and capacitance constants are not adjustable param-
eters, but are values taken from the literature, and the sensitivity of
the different possible values of these parameters on zeta-potential
calculations has been achieved (see details in Appendix B and
Fig. 9).

Quartz–Water Interface: Calculations were performed using
the surface complexation reactions (Table 3), C 1 = 1.4 F m−2 or
0.81 F m−2, C 2 = 0.2 F m−2 (see Appendix B for details), and total
surface functional group densities of 10 and 25 sites nm−2 for pH
in the range 4–8 and for pH higher than 8, respectively. Results
of TLM calculations for a quartz–water interface are compared to
our measurements in Fig. 9A. The calculated ζ -potentials decrease
with increasing pH from 4.4 to 7.7, and remain constant in the pH
range 8–10.5. The calculated ζ -potentials are in a good agreement
with the measured ζ -potentials for pH ranging from 5.5 to 10. At
pH 4.4, the calculated ζ -potential (around −6 mV) is higher than
the measured ζ -potential (−16 mV). At pH higher than 10.5, the
calculated ζ -potentials at a quartz–solution interface do not agree
with the measured values.

Calcite–Water Interface: Calculations were performed using
the surface complexation reactions (Table 4), C 1 = 1.4 F m−2,
C 2 = 0.2 F m−2, and total surface functional group densities of
5 sites.nm−2 (see Appendix B for details). Results of TLM calcu-
lations for a calcite–water interface are compared to our measure-
ments in Fig. 9B). Let us notice that the calculated ζ -potentials show
a broad range of values depending on equilibrium constants pub-
lished in recent geochemical literature (Van Cappellen et al. 1993;
Pokrovsky et al. 1999; Fenter et al. 2000). Therefore, we are only able
to provide a semi-quantitative interpretation of our measurements
according to TLM results. TLM calculations do not agree with our
measurements while pH increases from 4.4 to 10.5. The measured
ζ -potentials show large variations and change of sign for pH higher
than 10.5 (Fig. 7a). However, the magnitude of these variations can
be compared with the magnitude of the range of TLM calculations
values (Fig. 9B). TLM calculations also present a change of sign;
electrical surface potentials calculated according to Van Cappellen
et al. (1993)’s (or Pokrovsky et al. 1999’s) equilibrium constants
are always positive, whereas electrical surface potentials calculated
according to Fenter et al. (2000)’s equilibrium constants became
negative for pH larger than 8.

In summary, our ζ -potential measurements can be explained by
a quartz–water interface when pH ranges from 5.5 to 8.5, and by
a calcite–water interface when pH is greater than 10.5. When pH

parameters (see Appendix B for details). The vertical dashed line is deduced
from Fig. 8, and indicates the limit of oversaturation with respect to calcite
(for pH greater than 8.7, the solutions are oversaturated with respect to
calcite). The chemical surface reactions considered are grouped in Tables 3
and 4.

ranges from 8.5 to 10.5, the measured ζ -potentials are higher than
the ζ -potentials calculated for a quartz–water interface and lower
than the ζ -potentials calculated for a calcite–water interface. These
measured ζ -potential values are probably representative of a surface
composed by a mixture of quartz and calcite. Note that constant
zeta potentials in the pH range 8.5 to 10.5 do not reﬂect the quartz–
water interface usually described in the literature [Pride and Morgan,

1991], which shows a large decrease in zeta potential with increasing
pH (see Fig. 7b). Our predicted values are ﬂat in this pH range
since our calculations are made using the [Ca2+] measured in our
experiments. In this pH range, the predicted values for quartz–water
interface are closer to the measurements than the predicted values for
calcite–water interface, probably because of the unﬁnished coating
of calcite on quartz grains since it is only the beginning of calcite
precipitation (although it was not possible to quantify the calcite
precipitation). The measured ζ -potentials change of sign for pH
greater than 11, can be explained by the calcite precipitation inferred
from the measured decrease of permeability and from chemical
speciation calculations.

4.4 Electrical surface conductivity

We now discuss the sensibility of the inferred ζ -value to the surface
conductivity value, as described by eq. (1). When calcite precipi-
tates, it coats the quartz surface. Therefore, the electrical surface
conductivity of the sand with a calcite coating is expected to be
different than the electrical surface conductivity of the initial sand.
To estimate the new electrical surface conductivity of the sand with
calcite coating, we should measure the electrical conductivity of
the sample versus the electrical conductivity of the ﬂuid saturat-
ing the sample, for a set of ﬂuid electrical conductivities ranging
from demineralized water up to saline water (about 1S m−1). How-
ever, if the sample is saturated with demineralized water, the coating
is expected to be dissolved. Therefore, to check the sensitivity of
the ζ -potentials values deduced from eq. (1) with an electrical sur-
face conductivity representative of carbonated rocks, we calculate
ζ -potentials, for pH greater than 10, according to eq. (1) with a sur-
face electrical surface conductivity equal to 1.4 ± 0.5 × 10−3 S m−1
(instead of 1.06 × 10−4 S m−1), which is the mean value of 14 electri-
cal surface conductivities of carbonated rocks (M. Zamora, personal
communication) (Fig. 10). The zeta potential is enhanced (in abso-
lute value) by ∼10 to 40 per cent, showing that it is important to
know precisely this parameter. However, the general trend and ob-
viously the change of sign observed in electrokinetic measurements
(Fig. 10) are the same within our experimental errors.

4.5 Consequences for ﬁeld interpretations

It has been shown that large hydrothermal system without prominent
surface area, and probably related to deeper intra-ediﬁce system, can
be recognized only through geophysical and geochemical measure-
ments (Finizola et al. 2003). In order to interpret the SP surveys
the streaming potential is always assumed positive in the ﬂow direc-
tion. We would like to emphasize that this assumption is not correct
when the zeta potential is positive instead of usually negative and

we explore the ﬁeld conditions needed to obtain a negative charge
separation along the ﬂuid ﬂow.

The distribution of SP and CO2 anomalies observed on volca-
noes is greatly inﬂuenced by the presence of structural limits such
as crater, caldera or landslide faults. These discontinuities clearly
constitute permeable drains on Stromboli (Finizola et al. 2003) al-
lowing the escape of upward hot ﬂuids and gas from the hydrother-
mal system: the electrical charge separation being usually positive
in the ﬂow direction, a positive SP anomaly is usually associated
to a structural limit. In the summit area of Stromboli particularly a
very dense survey was achieved for the ﬁrst time in a similar context
(Finizola et al. 2003), and the co-occurrence of SP, temperature and
CO2 positive anomalies above the main faults lead to the conclusion
that the transfer of hot hydrothermal ﬂuids, heat and gases around
the active area was controlled by the presence of more permeable
paths along the fault. It was also observed a ‘cold zone’ interpreted
as the ﬁlling of the craters by highly impermeable products, ﬂu-
ids, and heat only escaping along the border faults of the craters.
In contrast, further from the active area, a previous study (Finizola
et al. 2002) showed an inverse relationship between SP and CO2
anomalies at the scale of the island of Stromboli. High CO2 emana-
tions were correlated with signiﬁcant negative SP anomalies. This
correlation was interpreted considering the permeable faults away

from the active zone still allowing the upward migration of deep
CO2 degassing, but promoting the down-ward migration of ground
water. This interpretation is in agreement with the assumption that
charge separation is positive in the ﬂow direction, but would be
exactly the reverse assuming a reverse streaming potential. More-
over the occurrence of high-frequency SP signal closely associ-
ated with temperature anomalies, therefore, associated with high
hydrothermal ﬂux condensing close to the surface (Finizola et al.
2003) may have been interpreted considering the possibility of alter-
ation and apparition of secondary minerals displaying a reverse zeta
potential.

These results show the limits of the usual qualitative interpretation
of the small-scale pattern of SP anomalies in order to determine local
ﬂuid circulations.

We now explore the ﬁeld conditions needed to obtain negative
charge separation along a ﬂuid ﬂow, meaning a positive zeta poten-
tial. We showed that this reverse sign in the streaming potential can
be observed when secondary minerals such as calcite are present,
for high pH values. These characteristics may not be evident to be
observed on the hydrothermal systems of active volcanoes show-
ing mixing between acid gas species such as H2S, SO2, HCl, HBr,
HF, which lead to acid pH. However, calcite is often present in hy-
drothermal systems as an alteration product of volcanic rocks, pre-
cipitating on the walls of the rock cavities (Keller et al. 1979; Henley
& Ellis 1983; Robert 2001). Evidences of high hydrothermal ﬂux
condensing close to the surface can be inferred by soil temperature
elevation performed in the upper part of active volcanoes. These
thermal anomalies are thought to coincide with permeable zones
where uprising hot ﬂuids escape (Finizola et al. 2003), leading to
alteration and possibly to secondary minerals. Since electrical sur-
face potential of calcite can range from positive to negative values
depending on CO2 partial pressure, pH, and [Ca2+] (Pokrovsky et al.
1999), either SP maxima or SP minima can be correlated to CO2
maxima with the same ﬂuid circulation direction even at pH lower
than 9. Moreover calcite precipitation can also be effective on active
volcano in acid environment: actually, in complex volcanic system,
with a large output of magmatic CO2 and low contribution of HCl,
calcite can precipitate at low temperature such as 100◦C–130◦C or
at higher temperature such as >300◦C in a range of pH of 4.5–5 (Di
Liberto et al. 2002).

The electrokinetic properties of the studied quartz–calcite sand are
signiﬁcantly affected when precipitation of calcite as a secondary
mineral is observed. The ζ -potential is greatly reduced (in absolute
value) and can even change sign. The electrical surface potentials
calculated using TLM as a function of the pH, indicate that the
electrical surface potential values are controlled by a quartz–water
interface when pH ranges from 5.5 to 8.5, and by a calcite–water
interface when pH is greater than 10.5.

SP method is frequently used on active volcanoes to evidence
the hydrothermal systems and to outline their extension (Michel
& Zlotnicki 1998; L´enat et al. 2000; Finizola et al. 2002, 2003,
2004). The small-scale patterns of SP and CO2 anomalies are used
to study tectonic fracture and structural limits. The electrokinetic
coupling is always assumed to be positive in the ﬂow direction—
therefore, the negative anomalies are interpreted in terms of down-
ward percolating rainfall, and the positive anomalies originate from
upward convective ﬂows (Zablocki 1976, 1978). This assump-
tion is accurate if the surface electrical potential of the rocks is

C(cid:1) 2006 Authors, GJI, 166, 445–460
Journal compilation C(cid:1) 2006 RAS

negative (see eq. 1). Surprisingly the SP studies do not check the
nature of the rocks, whereas the surface electrical potential of the
rock can be positive sometimes. In the ﬁeld, only one experiment
has been performed controlling CO2 injection while measuring SP
and showed an inversion in SP signals compared to the injection of
neutral gas (Martinelli 2000). Calcite is often present in hydrother-
mal systems as an alteration product of volcanic rocks, precipitat-
ing on the walls of the rock cavities (Keller et al. 1979; Henley
& Ellis 1983; Robert 2001). Since electrical surface potential of
calcite can range from positive to negative values depending on
CO2 partial pressure, pH, and [Ca2+] (Pokrovsky et al. 1999), ei-
ther SP maxima or SP minima can be correlated to CO2 maxima
with the same ﬂuid circulation direction even at pH lower than
9. Moreover calcite precipitation can also occur in acid environ-
ment such as pH of 4.5–5 on active volcano with a large output
of magmatic CO2 and low contribution of HCl (Di Liberto et al.
2002).

Therefore, SP anomalies as measured in hydrothermal ﬁeld, with-
out mineralogical analyses of hydrothermal deposits, and without
geochemical ﬂuid survey, should be interpreted with caution, to infer
ﬂuid circulations.

We detail here how we checked that the equilibrium between the
rock and the electrolyte was attained for sample 1. Measurements
of electrokinetic coupling, pH, and ﬂuid conductivity as a function
of time are shown in Fig. A1. The initial water (CaCl2 solution) has a
conductivity 0.0127 S m−1 and pH 5.5. After 750 mL ﬂowed through
the sample, the conductivity and the pH of the output water are σ f =
0, 0116 S m−1 and pH = 6.8. Then we wait 21 hr before the output
water is made to ﬂow through the sample. The water is circulated
twice 750 mL to check if the conductivity and pH are constant: at
this time, if the conductivity and pH of the output water are constant,
equilibrium is thought to be attained and streaming potential as a
function of various applied pressures is measured. The linearity
between the streaming potential and the applied pressure is checked
and the electrokinetic coupling coefﬁcient is deduced from 2 to 3
sets of measurements (see for examples Fig. 4). The measurements
performed at time 22 hr are made with the initial solution (exp.
1), whereas measurements performed at time 44 hr (exp. 2) are
performed using the initial solution added with CaOH2, although
the conductivity and pH are almost the same. These measurements
lead to a ζ -potential of −29 and −23 mV, respectively. At time
70 hr the pH of the solution is increased up to 8.9 by adding CaOH2.
Electrokinetic measurements are performed after waiting 1 hr and
the results show a large dispersion, probably because the equilibrium
is not attained. These measurements were not taken into account.
After waiting 20 hr (time 90 hr) the output water is made to ﬂow
trough the sample and the conductivity and pH of the ouput water
are σ f = 0,0155 S m−1 and pH = 8.3. This water is recirculated
twice in the sample and the conductivity and pH are constant: the
electrokinetic coupling coefﬁcient can be, therefore, quantiﬁed (exp.
3 and 4). Then the pH of water is increased up to 9.5 and after waiting
27 hr the output water is recirculated twice and the conductivity
and pH are checked to be constant and the electrokinetic coupling
coefﬁcient is quantiﬁed (exp. 5). All the measurements have been
performed using this experimental protocol.

The long run times needed to reach chemical equilibrium have
already been emphasized by Davis & Kent (1990), who questioned
the applicability of surface complexation models to carbonates. Fur-

thermore, Zachara et al. (1993) observed that surface adsorption
processes for divalent cations onto calcite and carbonates occur
over two characteristic durations: one of a few hours, in relation
to reversible reactions, and another of several days associated with
irreversible reactions. The latter phenomena involve changes in the
chemical bonding of the adsorbed divalent cations, inducing the
formation of a recrystallized surface phase or a solid solution. The
latter phenomena are not investigated in the present paper.

Error sources

The error on each zeta potential deduced from eq. (1) was calcu-
lated by the sum of the errors on: the dielectric constant, the water
conductivity, the viscosity, and the measured coupling coefﬁcient.
Temperature variation is taken into account for the dielectric con-
stant. The error on ﬂuid conductivity is ±0.4 per cent; the error on
viscosity due to temperature variations is for most of the experi-
ments between 1 and 5 per cent, but is between 9 and 13 per cent
for the experiments performed a temperature below 16.5◦; the error
on the electrokinetic coupling coefﬁcients is ±1 to ±5 per cent for
most of the measurements, and ±12 per cent for exp. 8. Each error
has been quantiﬁed on zeta potential (Table 1) and is included in
the size of drawing in Figs 5, 7, 9 and 10. The surface conductivity
is taken into account, however, since the exact value is not known
precisely for pH higher than 9, this point has been developed in
Section 4.4.

The measurements performed at time 22 hr are made with the
initial solution (exp. 1) and lead to a zeta potential of −29 mV.
The measurements performed with the initial solution on two other
samples (exp. 13 and 21) lead to a zeta potential of −30 and −31 mV,
respectively. Therefore, the variation from sample to sample leads
to an error of ±3.5 per cent, which is, for most of the measurements,
the same order of magnitude of the error due to the eq. (1).

We describe here the TLM, which is used to calculate zeta potentials
of our sand/calcite–water interface to interpret the electrokinetic
measurements as a function of pH (see Section 4).

The TLM distinguishes three planes to describe the electrical
double layer. One plane, called the Inner Helmholtz Plane (IHP),
for counter ions that are directly bound to the mineral structure and

another plane, called the Outer Helmholtz Plane (OHP), for weakly
bound counter ions (see Fig. B1) (Grahame 1947). The counter ions
of the IHP are assumed to be chemically adsorbed, forming a chem-
ical bond with the surface functional group. On the other hand, the
counter ions of the OHP are assumed to be physically adsorbed and
more labile. The TLM also takes account of a third plane, called
the d-plane, associated with the smallest distance between the min-
eral surface and the counter ions in the diffuse layer. At every plane
is related an electrical surface charge density σ and an electrical
potential φ. The electrical surface charge densities and potentials
are supposed to follow the Stern–Grahame relationships (Grahame
1947):
φ0 − φβ = σ0/C1
φβ − φd = (σ0 + σβ )/C2
σ0 + σβ + σd = 0
where the subscript 0, β and d refer to IHP, OHP, and d-plane, C 1 and
C 2 the integral capacitances of the interfacial layers. The electrical
potential on the d-plane is usually estimated by the Gouy–Chapman
charge–potential relationship based on the bulk solution chemistry:

The reader can ﬁnd a comprehensible report of uses and results of
the TLM in Davis & Kent (1990).

The Stern–Grahame model assumes that the surface of the min-
eral, the β-plane and the d-plane can be considered as plates of
a planar condenser. The model of a planar condenser is appropri-
ate if the thickness of the diffuse layer, around two Debye lengths,
is small compared with the grain radius. In our study, the mean
grain diameter is 3 × 10−4 m, and the Debye length is smaller than
10−9 m.

It has been proposed that the approximation be made that the slip-
ping plane lies near the distance of closest approach of dissociated
ions, that is, φ d = ζ (Davis & Kent 1990). The surface electrical
potential of the d-plane can be determined by solving eqs (B2) and
(B3) . In order to solve these equations, the electrical surface charge
densities σ 0 and σ β must be determined from the surface complex-
ation reactions, which themselves depend on the surface functional
groups and on the ionic species in the aqueous solution.

We describe here the surface functional group used to model the
quartz surface, and we detail the appropriate values of the total sur-
face functional group density: for pH range 4–8 and for pH greater
than 8 we use a total surface functional group density of 10 sites
nm−2, and 25 sites nm−2, respectively.

The quartz surface has been extensively studied, and its proper-
ties can be modelled with silanol >SiOH group (Davis et al. 1978;
Sahai & Sverjensky 1997a,b). Many experiments have been per-
formed with silica gels (Ahrland et al. 1960; Dugger et al. 1964)
and with natural silica (Somasundaran & Kulkarni 1973; Schindler
et al. 1976; Ishido & Mizutani 1981; Lorne et al. 1999a). In sum-
mary, the OH− and H+ ions, termed potential-determining ions, are

adsorbed onto the mineral surface and determine the charge den-
sity σ 0. Thus, the surface charge of quartz is a function of pH; the
charge is positive for pH < pzc and negative for pH > pzc. The pzc
of quartz is in the range 2 < pH < 4 (Parks 1965; Tadros & Lyklema
1969; Parks 1984; Glover et al. 1994; Lorne et al. 1999a). Since the
pH of natural waters ranges from 4 to 10 (Sigg et al. 2000), the
quartz surface is generally negatively charged. The major cations of
natural waters (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+) are found to be adsorbed
onto the β-plane. Two reactions are possible with divalent cations
(Ahrland et al. 1960; Dugger et al. 1964; Tadros & Lyklema 1969;
Schindler et al. 1976; Stumm et al. 1976); the cation can form either
a monodentate or a bidentate surface complex.

The surface parameters used for quartz in the present model are
obtained from (Sahai & Sverjensky 1997a,b; Sverjensky & Sahai
1996) and are listed in Table 1. Since Ca2+ is the major ion during
the experimental runs (Table 1), we ignore the other species such as
Mg2+, Na+ and K+. To simplify the calculation, we do not consider
the formation of a bidentate surface complex of calcium. For pH
in the range 4–8 and for pH higher than 8, we use total surface
functional group densities of 10 and 25 sites.nm−2, respectively.

Calcite surface

We describe here the surface functional group used to model the
calcite surface, and we show the different possible values of the
calciﬁcation reaction constants.

The surface electrical potential of calcite has been investigated
by many geochemists over the last 50 yr (Douglas & Walker 1950;
Somasundaran & Agar 1967; Smallwood 1977; Foxall et al. 1979;
Siffert & Fimbel 1984; Thompson & Pownall 1989; Cicerone et al.
1992; Vdovic 2001) and measurements are sometimes contradic-
tory (Fig. 2). For instance, the zero point of charge (pHpzc) varies
according to authors from 7 to 10.8 (Van Cappellen et al. 1993).
Curves of ζ -potential versus pH show hysteresis loops (Thompson &
Pownall 1989), while different electrokinetic behaviours are ob-
served on natural or synthetic calcite, the ζ -potentials of natural
calcite being systematically lower than the values obtained for syn-
thetic calcite (Vdovic 2001).

In summary, Ca2+ and carbonate ions are the potential-
determining ions (Somasundaran & Agar 1967; Foxall et al. 1979;
Cicerone et al. 1992). H+ and OH− modify the surface electrical
potential because they regulate the concentrations of Ca2+ and car-
bonate ions. Contradictory behaviours are observed at a given pH,
because (i) the concentrations of the potential-determining ions are
variable (Thompson & Pownall 1989; Cicerone et al. 1992); (ii)
important dissolution and precipitation reactions imply that chem-
ical equilibrium cannot be reached easily (Somasundaran & Agar
1967), and that—in the presence of other ions—the rapid exchange
rates can transform the nature of the solid surface layer (Fuller &
Davis 1987; Cicerone et al. 1992; Zachara et al. 1993). The most
common approach to evaluate the validity of surface complexation
theory is through measurements of surface charge (Fenter et al.
2000). However, calcite surface charge variation versus pH is dif-
ﬁcult to measure by potentiometric titrations because of calcite’s
rapid dissolution (Charlet et al. 1990).

Therefore, different values of the calciﬁcation reaction constants
are published in the literature. Van Cappellen et al. (1993) pro-
posed a model with two surface functional groups, >CaOH0 and
>CO3H0, which can react with Ca2+, carbonate ions, H+ and

OH− (Table 4). The surface functional groups are based on X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopic observations measured under ultra-
high vacuum conditions (Stipp & Hochella 1991). The equilibrium
constants are calculated to obtain a pHZPC near 8.2 with atmospheric
CO2 partial pressure. This model predicts that the calcite surface has
distinct termination depending on solution composition (pH, pCa,
and PCO2) and shows a reaction constant log K = −2.8 (Table 4).
Fenter et al. (2000) present in situ X-ray reﬂectivity measurements
of the calcite–water interface at pH ranging from 6.8 to 12.1 and low
PCO2 which show that the calcite surface does not vary signiﬁcantly
over this range of experimental conditions, and can be explained
without invoking changes other than protonation reactions in the
surface speciation. Particularly Fenter et al.’s measurements do not
require a calciﬁcation reaction as proposed by Van Cappellen et al.
(1993): > CO3H0 + Ca2+ →← > CO3Ca+ + H+, and a value of log
K < −4.4 satisﬁes X-ray reﬂectivity measurements. On the other
hand, Pokrovsky & Schott (1999) provide an higher estimate for the
log K (−1.7) of the calciﬁcation reaction.

Finally, we use Van Cappellen’s model, and the variability of
calciﬁcation reaction constants on the calculated zeta potentials is
taken into account (Fig. 9), using a total surface site density value
of 5 sites per nm2 as reported by Davis & Kent (1990).

Integral Capacitances of the interfacial layer

The values of the integral capacitances of the interfacial layers,
C 1 and C 2, are related to the dielectric properties of the interface,
particularly the water permittivity value. Despite the widespread
application of such surface complexation models, the choice of the
integral capacitance values is not straightforward because these val-
ues depend on the speciﬁc oxide and on the type of electrolyte,
and cannot be directly measured (Sverjensky 2001). Usually C 1 and
C 2 values are chosen as adjustable parameters, consistent with in-
terfacial dielectric constant 80, and equal to 1–1.4 and 0.2 F m−2,
respectively (Davis & Kent 1990). Although measurements of the
water permittivity at the interface are scarce and difﬁcult, the wa-
ter permittivity is supposed to be smaller near the mineral surface
than within the bulk solution, <10 (e.g. Kurosaki 1954). Recently
Sverjensky (2001) proposed a model consistent with interfacial di-
electric constants ranging from 20 to 62, and obtained C 1 = 0.81 and
1.00 F m−2 for quartz with CaCl2 electrolyte and NaCl electrolyte,
respectively.

Calcite, and more generally carbonate minerals, develop rela-
tively high surface charge, about 100 times higher than oxides, and
show ζ -potential values of the same order of magnitude (Pokrovsky
et al. 1999). Van Cappellen et al. (1993) propound that carbonate-
water interface is thin and has highly structured (i.e. non-diffuse)
electric double layer with high capacitance. It is likely, in the case
of calcite, that Ca2+ and HCO−
3 (CO2−
3 ) form inner-sphere speciﬁc
interactions with the charged surface, leading to the formation of a
very thin double layer (Pokrovsky et al. 1999). This could account
for great difference in composition and structure of the EDL formed
by oxides or by carbonates (Pokrovsky et al. 1999).

Finally we use C 2 = 0.2 F m−2 for quartz–water interface and
for calcite–water interface, and C 1 = 1.4 F m−2 or 0.81 F m−2
for quartz–water interface, and C 1 = 1.4 F m−2 for calcite–water
interface. The variability of the integral capacitance values on the
calculated zeta potentials is shown in Fig. 9(a).

We investigate one-dimensional transverse modulational instability in a non local medium 

excited with a spatially incoherent source. Employing undoped nematic liquid crystals in a 

planar pre-tilted configuration, we investigate the role of the spectral broadening induced 

by  incoherence  in  conjunction  with  the  spatially  non  local  molecular  reorientation.  The 

phenomenon is modeled using the Wigner transform.

Modulational  instability  (MI)  in  time  and  space  is  generally  related  to  the  instability  of  flat 

wavefront  solutions  in  the  presence  of  a  nonlinear  response.  Optical  transverse  MI  is  usually 

thought as a precursor to spatial solitons [1] and it has been previously investigated in parametric 

crystals,  [2-5]  photorefractives,  [6-11]  semiconductors,  [12]  and  liquid  crystals.  [13]  Noise 

perturbations in an intense enough plane wave produce a transverse pattern due to the nonlinear 

response, which can evolve into filaments. The growth of transverse spectral components drags 

energy from the input plane wave, with a resulting selective gain peaked at a specific periodicity 

for a given excitation. [1,14-15] This MI “side band” shifts towards higher wave numbers as the 

power increases, eventually resulting into thinner and more closely spaced filaments. 

In  nematic  liquid  crystals  (NLC)  a  large  non-resonant  nonlinear  response  (with  an  equivalent 

Kerr  coefficient  106-109  times  higher  than  semiconductors)  due  to  molecular  reorientation  is 

coupled to a significant non locality in time and in space.[16-17]  When the angle between the 

r
average molecular alignment  nˆ  and the field vector  A

 is not 

2p

 (i.e. Freédericks transition), 

the reorientation is thresholdless and can sustain the propagation of spatial solitons.[18]  Owing 

to  the  elastic  forces  between  molecules  in  NLC,  however,  the  refractive  perturbation  extends 

well beyond the driving field, hence the response is highly non local.[19] 

Theoretical studies have addressed MI and its features in spatially non local media, [20-21] and 

the role played by the high non locality of NLC has been recently  addressed both theoretically 

and experimentally.[13, 19, 22]  Non locality limits the spectral response, producing a “smooth” 

transverse  perturbation.[12]  This  corresponds  to  low-pass  filtering  in  the  MI  gain,  thereby 

moderating  its  peak  shift  towards  high  wave  numbers  as  the  pump  power  is  increased.  Spatial 

modulation instability owing to a spatially incoherent excitation has been studied in weakly non 

local photorefractive crystals.[6-11]

In this Letter, in order to further understand the interplay between a high non locality and spatial 

incoherence on the onset of transverse MI, we investigate one-dimensional MI in undoped NLC, 

comparing its features with the coherent case. 

We  employed NLC samples as in Ref. [13]: a suitably treated 75m m-thick  glass cell  contained 

the nematic uniaxial E7 (indices

threshold.  The beam from an Argon-ion laser was shaped into an ellipse  >200m m-wide along 

the  transverse  axis  Y,  according  to  the  geometry  sketched  in  Fig.  1.  Light  propagation  was 

studied by imaging the light scattered thru the top interface.  The spatial coherence of the pump 

was  controlled  using  a  rotating  diffuser  inserted  in  the  beam  path.  The  diffuser,  a  plastic  disc 

with scratches in the tangential direction and variable density along the  radius, caused spectral 

broadening in the (Y, Z) propagation plane. The rotation speed of the disc was adjusted to grant a 

speckle  substitution  mean  time  lower  than  the  NLC  response  time.  The  degree  of  spatial 

incoherence was estimated by a second CCD camera imaging the optical Fourier transform of the 

input  beam  and  quantified  as  the  ratio  between  the  transverse  spectral  broadening  (standard 

deviation) with (D KY) and without (D KY0) diffuser. Figure 2 (left hand side) shows two typical 

Fourier transforms in the coherent and an incoherent case with D KY=4.1 D KY0. 

Considering a cell much thicker than the beam (across X), the general model governing 

the reorientation  Y

 can be cast in the form: [19]

. This model concerns bulk propagation in 

nematic  liquid  crystals,  in  the  same  experimental  geometry  of  Ref.  [13].  The  quantitative 

agreement between theory  and data in the coherent case proves  that boundary conditions, (e.g. 

finite sample thickness) play a negligible role. 

The  theoretical  analysis  of  incoherent  MI  of  Eq.(1)  and  the  paraxial  evolution  equation  for  A 

[13]  can  be  carried  out  based  on  the  Wigner-Moyal  equation  with  the  Klimontovich  statistic

When the speckle size in the beam is comparable with the NLC transverse relaxation length, MI 

is  expected  to  be  strongly  depressed:  high  pump-wavenumbers  tend  to  induce  transverse 

perturbations  with  spatial  frequencies  larger  than  the  response  cutoff,  thereby  filtered  out  in 

propagation and simply contributing to the background illumination.  

Following the analysis in Ref. [23], it is possible to write the generalized dispersion relation in 

the presence of a non local response (details will be given elsewhere):

Eq. (4) reproduces the coherent-light gain-profile when

. It also implies, as anticipated, that both non-locality and incoherence 

(measured by the linewidth 

0p ) act to suppress MI. 

The  comparison  shown  in  Fig.  2  (center  and  right  panels)  is  in  agreement  with  the  predicted 

trend: as a substantial degree of incoherence is introduced in an otherwise comparable excitation 

in power, size and  average distribution, the insurgence of  an  MI pattern is severely reduced in 

visibility over the same propagation distance.  Fig. 3 shows a comparison between acquired MI 

patterns  in  Z=0.2mm  for  various  degrees  of  incoherence  and  excitations.  At  low  power 

(P=40mW)  the  beam  has  an  average  Gaussian  distribution  and  propagates  substantially 

unmodified  in  shape.  At  higher  powers  (from  left  to  right)  MI  becomes  progressively  more 

visible:  a  transverse  nearly-periodic  intensity  pattern  emerges  and  eventually  breaks  up  into 

filaments  (P=300mW  and  D KY=D KY0),  unless  significant  incoherence  is  introduced  (top  to 

bottom).   

Having  defined  the  MI  gain  as  the  ratio  between  high-  and  low-power  spectra  of  transverse 

profiles,  Fig.  4  shows  that  MI  is  always  present,  with  a  general  trend  in  agreement  with 

incoherent-MI in local media: the gain side-band becomes smaller and its peak moves towards 

lower  wavenumbers  as  the  incoherence  increases.    MI  appeared  to  become  unappreciable  at

lower  and  lower  powers  or  higher  and  higher  degrees  of  incoherence,  until  in  our  samples  the 

transverse perturbation could no longer be separated from the noisy background.  

A  direct  comparison  between  Eq.  (4)  or  the  more  general  (3)  and  experimental  data  (as  in  the 

coherent case, see Ref. [13]) cannot be readily performed from such preliminary results. In the 

incoherent case, in fact, the shape of the noise spectrum plays a major role and, in general, is not 

Lorentzian (as assumed in (4)). Moreover, the mutual interplay of incoherence, speckle-size and 

finite  numerical  aperture  needs  be  ascertained  in  much  greater  detail  for  a  meaningful 

quantitative assessment.  

In  conclusions,  we  have  systematically  investigated  one-dimensional  transverse  modulation 

instability in nematic liquid crystals under incoherent excitation. The Wigner transform approach 

enables  a  comprehensive  model  of  incoherent  MI  in  highly  non  local  nonlinear  media  and 

supports the physical intuition of the interplay between non locality and incoherence. Via the non 

locality inherent to NLC, the degree of beam spatial incoherence clearly translates into a reduced 

MI gain with peak shifted to lower wave-numbers. Liquid crystals appear to candidate for optical 

processing devices in which an adjustable dependence on input (in)coherence can be tailored to a

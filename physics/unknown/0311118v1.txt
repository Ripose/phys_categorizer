Abstract.  We  demonstrate  a  new  method  for  determining  the 
81Kr/Kr  ratio  in  environmental  samples  based  upon  two 
measurements:  the  85Kr/81Kr  ratio  measured  by  Atom  Trap 
Trace  Analysis  (ATTA)  and  the  85Kr/Kr  ratio  measured  by 
Low-Level  Counting  (LLC).  This  method  can  be  used  to 
determine the mean residence time of groundwater in the range 
of  105  –  106  a.  It  requires  a  sample  of  100  µl  STP  of  Kr 
extracted from approximately two tons of water. With modern 
atmospheric  Kr  samples,  we  demonstrate  that  the  ratios 
measured by ATTA and LLC are directly proportional to each 
other within the measurement error of ±10%; we calibrate the 
81Kr/Kr  ratio  of  modern  air  measured  using  this  method;  and 
we show that the  81Kr/Kr ratios of samples extracted from air 
before  and  after  the  development  of  the  nuclear  industry  are 
identical within the measurement error. 

81Kr (t1/2 = 2.3 ×105 a, 81Kr/Kr ~ 10-13) has been proposed as 
the ideal tracer isotope for dating old water and ice in the age 
range of 105-106 a (Loosli and Oeschger, 1969). 81Kr is mainly 
produced  in  the  upper  atmosphere  by  cosmic-ray  induced 
spallation and neutron activation of stable krypton. Because of 
the  constancy  of  the  cosmic  ray  flux  and  the  fact  that  the 
atmosphere  is  well-mixed  and  represents  the  only  significant 
terrestrial  Kr  reservoir,  the  81Kr  abundance  in  the  atmosphere 
is  expected  to  be  constant  on  the  time  scale  of  its  lifetime. 
Subsurface  sources  and  sinks  for  81Kr  other  than  radioactive 
decay  are  most  likely  negligible  (Lehmann  et  al.,  2003). 
Human  activities  involving  nuclear  fission  have  a  negligible 
effect  on  the  81Kr  concentration  because  its  direct  yield  from 
spontaneous fission of 238U is small and because the stable 81Br 
shields  81Kr  from  the  decay  of  other  fission  products.  On  the 
other  hand,  85Kr  (t1/2  =  10.8  a,  85Kr/Kr  ~  10-11)  is  a  fission 
product of  235U and  239Pu, and is released into the atmosphere 
primarily  by  nuclear  fuel  reprocessing.  Its  abundance  has 
increased by six orders of magnitude since the 1950's. 85Kr can 
be  used  as a tracer to study air and ocean currents, determine 
residence time of young groundwater in shallow aquifers, and 
monitor nuclear-fuel processing activities (Loosli, 1992). 

For  85Kr analysis, Low-Level Counting (LLC) is performed 
routinely  in  several  specialized  laboratories  around  the  world 
(Loosli,  1992).  LLC  was  the  first  method  used  to  detect  81Kr 
and  measure  its  abundance  in  the  atmosphere  (Loosli,  1969).

However,  LLC  is  too  inefficient  for  practical  analysis of  81Kr 
because  only  a  fraction  3  × 10-8  of  81Kr  atoms  in  a  sample 
decay  during  a  typical  100  hour  measurement.  In  general, 
counting atoms is preferable to counting decays for analysis of 
long-lived  isotopes  such  as  81Kr.  Two  laser-based  methods, 
Resonance  Ionization  Mass  Spectrometry  (RIMS)  and  Photon 
Burst  Mass  Spectrometry  (PBMS),  have  both  been  developed 
towards detecting  81Kr and  85Kr in environmental samples (Lu 
and  Wendt,  2003).  Using  RIMS,  Lehmann  et  al.  (1991) 
reported  the  measurement  of  81Kr  in  krypton  gas  extracted 
from  water  samples  in  the  Milk  River  aquifer  in  Canada. 
Moreover, 
in  recent  work  based  on  Accelerator  Mass 
Spectrometry  (AMS),  using  a  high-energy  (~  4  GeV) 
accelerator  in  order  to  separate  81Kr  from  the  abundant  81Br, 
Collon et al. (2000) analyzed 81Kr in old groundwater samples 
from Australia at an efficiency of 2 × 10-5, with which a 10% 
measurement  required  500  µl  STP  krypton  extracted  from  16 
tons of groundwater.  

Atom  Trap  Trace  Analysis  (ATTA)  is  a  relatively  new 
atom-counting  method,  and  was  used  to  detect  both  81Kr  and 
85Kr in natural atmospheric samples (Chen et al., 1999). It uses 
a table-top apparatus in a standard laboratory environment. In 
ATTA,  an  atom  of  a  particular isotope is selectively captured 
by a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and detected by observing its 
fluorescence.  When  the  laser  frequency  is  tuned  to  within  a 
few  natural  linewidths  on  the  low-frequency  side  of  the 
resonance of the desired isotope, only atoms of this particular 
isotope  are  trapped.  Atoms  of  other  isotopes  are  either 
deflected  before  reaching  the  trap  or  are  allowed  to  pass 
through  the  trap  without  being  captured.  An  atom  can  be 
trapped  and  observed  for  100  ms or longer, during which 106 
fluorescence  photons  can  be  induced  from  a  single  trapped 
atom  and  as  many  as  104  photons  can  be  detected,  thereby 
allowing  the  counting  of  single  atoms  to  be  done  with  a  high 
signal-to-noise  ratio  as  well  as  a  superb  selectivity.  Indeed

including  a  more  intense  source  of  metastable  Kr  atoms,  a 
recirculating  vacuum  system  and  better  optical  arrangements 
have been implemented. At present, the count rate of 81Kr in a 
sample  of  modern  atmospheric  Kr  is  12  hr-1,  the  counting 
efficiency  is  1  ×  10-4,  and  the  required  sample  size  is  50  µl 
STP Kr. 

interference  from  other

to 

is 

For  accurate  analysis,  the  81Kr  count  rate  is  normalized  to 
that of a control isotope, and the 81Kr abundance is determined 
by the ratio of the two count rates. By frequently switching the 
system  between  counting  81Kr  and  counting  the  control 
isotope,  much  of  the  common-mode  noise  on  count  rates  due 
to  the  variation  of  the  instrumental  parameters  is  cancelled  in 
the  ratio.  Furthermore,  age  is  determined  by  the  ratio  of  the 
81Kr abundance in the sample over that in the atmosphere; it is 
in effect a ratio of ratios, which further cancels any systematic 
effects. In principle, the stable  83Kr can be used as the control 
isotope. In practice, however, its count rate by ATTA, 109 s-1, 
is  too  high  for  atom  counting.  On  the  other  hand,  85Kr  at  the 
10-11  abundance  level  can  be  introduced  into  the  sample  and 
calibrated  accurately  with  LLC.  The  spiked  85Kr  can  then  be 
counted at the single atom level and serve as a reliable control 
isotope. On the other hand, in young (<100 a) atmospheric Kr

measure variations in the 85Kr abundance of unspiked samples. 
the  validity  of  ATTA  for 
quantitative  analysis,  we  measured  the  85Kr/81Kr  ratios  of  ten 
Kr samples using ATTA at Argonne. Among these Kr samples 
extracted from modern air (age <100 a), the 81Kr/Kr ratios are 
expected to be identical. On the other hand, the  85Kr/Kr ratios 
are  expected  to  vary  and  were  measured  using  LLC  at  Bern. 
The  85Kr/81Kr values measured with ATTA are then compared 
with  the  85Kr/Kr  values  obtained  with  LLC  for  the  following 
purposes: 1) to verify the proportional relationship between the 
two  sets  of  ratios;  2)  to  calibrate  the  81Kr/Kr  ratio  of  modern 
air measured by ATTA, which serves as the initial ratio in the 
calculation of groundwater residence times; 3) to compare the 
81Kr/Kr ratios of atmospheric Kr samples extracted before and 
after  the  development  of  nuclear  industry,  which  are  often 
referred to as pre-bomb and post-bomb samples. 

 

Low-Level Counting (LLC) 

ratio  measured 

At  the  LLC  laboratory  of  the  University  of  Bern,  85Kr  was 
measured  with  gas  proportional  counting  (Fig.  1).  99.6  %  of 
the 85Kr atoms β-decay with a maximum energy of 0.69 MeV. 
Because  of  this  relatively  high  β-energy  and  in  order  to 
identify  gas  impurities  the  whole  energy  spectrum  above  4 
keV  is  measured  using  a  multi-channel  analyzer.  The  gas 
multiplication  factor  is  calibrated  every  other  day  using  an 
external  241Am  source  which  induces  a  fixed  8.5  keV  x-ray 
line.  The  energy  deposition  within  the  gas  volume  increases 
with gas pressure in the counter. Therefore counters of 16 cm3 
and  22  cm3  are  operated  at  2-5  bars  using  P-10  gas  (90% 
argon, 10% methane, and krypton sample). The Kr abundance 
in the counting gas is determined from the filling pressure and 
for  each  sample  by  mass 
the  Kr/Ar 
spectrometry  after  counting.  In  order  to  achieve  very  low 
background count-rates, counting is carried out in a laboratory 
35  meters  below  the  earth  surface  (shielding  ~  70  m  water 
equivalent). The walls of the laboratory were built with special 
low-activity concrete. In addition, old lead shielding surrounds 
the  counters  that  are  made  from  high-purity  copper  and  are 
operated 
inside  guard 
counters  (Forster  et  al.,  1992).  The  remaining  background 
count-rate for a 16 cc counter filled with a pressure of 2.3 bar 
is 1.2 hr-1 compared to a signal of approximately 40 hr-1 for a 
modern Kr sample. This corresponds to a detector efficiency of 
70%. Typical counting times are 3-6 days, during which (0.5 – 
1) × 10-3 of the  85Kr atoms in the sample decay. The detection 
limit is about 0.01 Bq/cc Kr with a minimum Kr sample size of 
5 µl. 

in  anticoincidence  arrangements 

The  activity  of  85Kr  in  the  atmosphere  has  been  steadily 
increasing,  from  a  pre-bomb  level  of    ~  10-6  Bq/cc  Kr,    to  a 
present-day  level  of  1.4  Bq/cc  Kr  (Loosli  et  al.,  2000), 
corresponding  to  a  85Kr/Kr  ratio  of  2.5  ×  10-11.  Pre-bomb 
samples  extracted  from  old  groundwater  have  negligible 
amount  of  85Kr.  For  ATTA  measurements,  in  which  85Kr  is 
used as a control isotope, a calibrated amount of 85Kr are added 
to  the  samples.  The  spike  gas  should  have  a  high  85Kr/81Kr 
ratio  in  order  to  minimize  the  portion  of  81Kr  added  to  the 
samples, especially for very old samples with low  81Kr/Kr. In 
this work, the gas used for spiking the pre-bomb samples has a 

4

 

 

85Kr/Kr  ratio  of  1.02  ×  10-9  and  was  produced  by  diluting  a 
1.85  ×  108  Bq  85Kr  standard.  Ten  samples  were  prepared  and 
analyzed (Table 1). The 85Kr/Kr ratios of samples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 
and  9  were  measured  by  LLC;  the  85Kr/Kr  ratios  of  the 
mixtures (samples 4, 7, 8 and 10) were calculated according to 
the mixing ratios. 

Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) 

The  principle  of  ATTA  and  the  design  of  a  first-
generation  ATTA  system  have  been  described  elsewhere 
(Chen  et  al.,  1999).  Here  we  briefly  describe  the  design  and 
operation  of  a  second-generation  ATTA  system  (Fig.  2).  An 
all-diode-laser  system  supplies  the  laser  beams  for  transverse 
cooling,  slowing,  and  trapping.  The  frequency  of  the  laser, 
after  an  approximate  800  MHz  offset  generated  by  a  tunable 
acousto-optic  modulator  (AOM)  to  compensate  for  isotope 
shifts,  is  locked  to  the  resonance  of  the  5s[3/2]2  (cid:198)  5p[5/2]3 
transition  of  the  abundant  84Kr  in  a  reference  vapor  cell.  The 
electronic  control  of  the  AOM  offset  frequency  allows  us  to 
tune the laser frequencies to match the transitions of 83Kr, 85Kr, 
and 81Kr, and to trap atoms of these isotopes, respectively. The 
Kr  sample  is  injected  through  a  leak  valve  into  the  source 
chamber where a rf-driven discharge produces Kr atoms in the 
metastable 5s[3/2]2 level. The emerging beam of metastable Kr 
atoms  is  cooled  in  both  transverse  directions  to  enhance  its 
flux in the forward direction by a factor of 20. The metastable 
Kr  atoms  then  enter  a  1.2  meter  long  Zeeman  slower,  where 
they are decelerated to 20 m/s as they enter the trap chamber. 
In the trap chamber, a MOT is used to capture the slow atoms 
and confine them in a sub-millimeter region in the center of the 
chamber. A single trapped Kr atom scatters photons at a rate of 
107  s-1,  of  which  5%  are  collected  and  imaged  onto  an 
avalanche  photo-diode  with  a  photon-counting  efficiency  of 
25% at 811 nm wavelength. The resulting single-atom signal is 
a photon count rate of 20 kHz above a background of 13 kHz 
(Fig. 3). In a 60 ms counting period, the single atom detection 
achieves  a  signal-to-noise  ratio  of  45.  The  vacuum  system  is 
differentially pumped by three turbo pumps so as to maintain a 
pressure of a few mTorr in the source chamber and a pressure 
of ~ 10-8 Torr in the trap chamber. A getter pump in the source 
chamber removes reactive gases, such as hydrogen, water, etc., 
from  the  vacuum  system  while  leaving  noble  gases  including 
the  Kr  sample  intact.  A  novel  feature  of  the  system  is  that  it 
can be switched into a mode which repeatedly circulates the Kr 
atoms  through  the  vacuum  system  and  thereby  improves  the 
counting efficiency by a factor of a thousand to reach 1 × 10-4. 
For an analysis, the system is filled to the operation condition 
with 30 µl STP of Kr sample, which lasts for ten hours before 
the rising pressure due to argon outgassing requires the system 
to  be  pumped  out  and  refilled.  An  analysis  run  consists  of 
many  ~  40-minute  counting  cycles:  10  minutes  for  counting 
85Kr  followed  by  30  minutes for counting  81Kr. For a modern 
atmospheric Kr sample, the typical count rate is 12 hr-1 for 81Kr 
and 240 hr-1 for 85Kr. 

When  the  rf-discharge  is  on,  a  small  fraction  of  the  Kr 
atoms are ionized and imbedded into the surrounding surfaces. 
Meanwhile,  the  previously  embedded  Kr  atoms  are  released 
into  the  vacuum.  Memory  effect  arises  as  the  embedded  Kr 
atoms  form  a  source  of  cross-sample  contamination.  This 

5

effect  is  mitigated  by  flushing  the  system  with  a  discharge of 
pure N2 or Ar between samples. After 14 hours of flushing, the 
average  amount  of  residual  Kr  present  during  a  ten-hour 
measurement is (4 ± 2)% of the Kr sample in the system. It can 
be  reduced  further  down  to  (3  ±  1.5)%  with  36  hours  of 
for  each 
flushing.  This  effect 
measurement, and will ultimately limit the minimum detection 
level to perhaps 1% of the modern level. 

should  be  corrected 

The results of both ATTA and LLC analyses are listed in 
Table  1.  The  amount  of  the  samples  consumed  in  ATTA 
measurements  are  50  -  178  µl  STP  of  Kr  and  the  LLC 
measurements  typically  consumed  50  µl  STP  of  Kr.  Each 
ATTA  measurement  took  15  -  20  hours.  The  error  of  ATTA 
measurement  of  sample  5,  a  pre-bomb  sample  free  of  85Kr,  is 
dominated by the error in the correction for the memory effect. 
The  error  of  the  other  ATTA  measurements  is  a  combination 
of  a  dominant  statistical  error  of  81Kr  counts  (~  100),  a 
statistical error of 85Kr counts, a 5% systematic error due to the 
uncertainties  in  laser  frequency  settings,  and  an  error  in  the 
correction 
for  memory  effect.  The  errors  of  LLC 
measurements  are  dominated  by  the  statistical  error  of  85Kr 
counts. As shown in Fig. 4, the 85Kr/81Kr ratios measured with 
ATTA  are  indeed  proportional  to  the  85Kr/Kr  ratios  measured 
with LLC; the best fit, with a reduced-χ2 = 0.6, indicates that  
[85Kr/81Kr]ATTA = (0.906 ± 0.040) × 1012 × [85Kr/Kr]LLC.  
This  proportionality  is  robust  as  the  ten  measurements  were 
carried out over a period of six months interspersed with major 
system  changes,  including  a  laser  replacement  and  numerous 
changes in optical alignments. 

Based  on  these  measurements,  we  derive  that  for  modern 

atmospheric samples  

[81Kr/Kr]modern = (1.10 ± 0.05) × 10-12  

as  measured  with  this  method.  This  value  should  not  yet  be 
taken  as  the  true  isotopic  abundance  of  81Kr  because  ATTA 
may  possess  isotope-dependent  bias  factors  that  cause  it  to 
count  one  isotope  somewhat  more  efficiently  than  the  other. 
The  weighted  mean  of  three  previous  measurements  on  the 
81Kr/Kr  measured  with  LLC 
(Loosli  and 
atmospheric 
Oeschger,  1969;  Kuzminov  and  Pomansky,  1980)  and  AMS

between  the  sample  and  the  atmosphere  that  determines  the 
age. 

is  not  yet  calibrated,  we 

find 

A  detailed  analysis  of  the  81Kr  budget  in  the  atmosphere 
concluded that the amount of  81Kr released by human activity 
such  as  nuclear  bomb  tests,  nuclear  fuel  reprocessing,  and 
nuclear  medicine,  is  four  orders  of  magnitude  less  than  that 
produced  by  cosmic  rays  in  the  atmosphere  (Collon  et  al., 
1999).  A  previous  measurement  by  AMS  confirmed  that  the 
81Kr/Kr  ratios  of  a  post-bomb  and  a  pre-bomb  atmospheric 
sample are equal within the ±30% measurement error (Collon 

 

6

et al., 1999). In our work, based on the measurements of post-
bomb samples 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9, we conclude that  
[81Kr/Kr]post-bomb = (1.07 ± 0.06) × 10-12;  

and based on the measurements of pre-bomb samples 8 and 10, 
we conclude that  

[81Kr/Kr]pre-bomb = (1.05 ± 0.08) × 10-12.  

No  changes  in  the  atmospheric  81Kr/Kr  ratio  are  observed  at 
the ±8% precision level. 

In  conclusion,  we  have  demonstrated  a  method,  combining 
ATTA  and  LLC,  having  potential  practical  applications  such 
as dating old groundwater. Incremental improvements on both 
the  efficiency  and  counting  rate  are  possible  with  more  laser 
power  and  by  implementing  a  more  sophisticated  transverse 
cooling  scheme.  Dramatic  improvements  may  be  realized  by 
producing  cold  metastable  Kr  atoms  with  a  photon-excitation 
scheme (Young et al., 2002).

fluorescence  of  the  trapped  atom;  the  background  is  due  to 
photons  scattered  off  the  surrounding  walls  of  the  vacuum 
chamber.

#  Sample  size  is  the  size  consumed  in  the  ATTA  measurement.  The 
sizes of samples 2 and 5 were not measured. 
*  The  pre-bomb  sample  was  collected  from  air  sometime  between 
1930  and  1940  in  Germany.  Among  the  three  pre-bomb  samples, 
sample 5 was not spiked with 85Kr, samples 8 and 10 were spiked. 
§  Samples  1,  2,  6,  and  9  originate  from  commercial  gas  processing 
companies;  sample  3  was  extracted  from  140  liters  of  modern  air; 
samples 4 and 7 are mixtures between post-bomb and pre-bomb Kr.

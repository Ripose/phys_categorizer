Abstract  :  We  propose  a  dynamical  model  for  the  secondary  structure  of  DNA,  which  is 

based  on  the  finite  stacking  enthalpies  used  in  thermodynamics  calculations.  In  this  model, 

the two strands can separate and the bases are allowed to rotate perpendicular to the sequence 

axis.  We  show,  through  molecular  dynamics  simulations,  that  the  model  has  the  correct 

behaviour at the denaturation transition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As  is  well-known,  DNA  is  a  set  of  two  entangled  polymers.  Each  monomer,  called 

nucleotide,  is  composed  of  three  elements,  namely  a  phosphate  group,  a  five-atomic  sugar 

ring, and a base (cytosine (C) and thymine (T) are monocyclic, guanine (G) and adenine (A) 

are bicyclic). The backbone of each strand consists of alternating phosphate and sugar groups. 

Each base is attached to a sugar group with its ring(s) roughly perpendicular to the sequence 

axis. The collection of letters A, T, G and C, which describes a specific DNA sequence and 

encodes  the  genetic  information  of  the  molecule,  is  known  as  the  "primary  structure",  or 

"genome", of the DNA. At body temperature, DNA is usually observed in the double-stranded 

structure,  which  results  from  the  association  of  two  polymers  of  single-stranded  DNA. 

Watson  and  Crick  showed  that  this  association  is  due  to  the  hydrogen  bonds,  which  are 

formed  selectively  between  A  and  T  and  between  G  and  C.  The  base-pairing  of  the  two 

polymers  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the  "secondary  structure"  of  DNA.  In  addition,  DNA 

sequences also have well-defined higher order conformations, like the B-, A- and Z- double 

helix forms, known as the "tertiary structure", which are however disregarded in this Letter. 

 

The two strands of DNA separate upon heating. This phenomenon, called denaturation 

or  melting  [1,2],  occurs  through  series  of  steps,  which  can  be  monitored  by  UV  absorption 

spectroscopy [3]. At each step, large portions of the inhomogeneous DNA sequence separate 

over very short temperature intervals. The whole denaturation process therefore looks like a 

chain  of  sharp,  first  order-like  phase  transitions.  At  the  scale  of  the  bases,  the  simplest 

description of melting assumes, like the Ising model, that a pair is either open or closed and 

that its evolution can be depicted by a two-state (0 or 1) variable. Starting with the work of 

Poland and Sheraga [4], a large number of models were based on this assumption. Some of 

them  are  now  commonly  and  successfully  used  to  compute  denaturation  curves  of 

homogeneous and inhomogeneous DNA, which are in good agreement with experiment [5,6]. 

 

2 

 

While  statistical  models  were  specifically  derived  to  investigate  the  denaturation  of 

DNA,  dynamical  models  based  on  a  Hamiltonian  function  of  continuous  variables  can  be 

expected  to  describe  the  whole  dynamics  of  DNA,  which  extends  from  small-amplitude 

oscillations at low temperatures to large-amplitude motions close to denaturation. The more 

ancient models, which were proposed to study soliton or solitary excitations in DNA (see Ref. 

[7] and references therein), can however not reproduce denaturation, because the only degree 

of freedom of each nucleotide is the rotation angle of the base around the strand axis. This is 

no  longer  the  case  for  the  model  proposed  by  Prohofsky  and  co-workers  (see  Ref.  [8]  and 

references therein), which consider instead that the principal source of non-linearity in DNA 

is  the  hydrogen  bond  between  paired  bases  (taken  as  a  Morse  potential),  and  that  the 

important degree of freedom is the corresponding stretching coordinate. Dauxois, Peyrard and 

Bishop  (DPB)  later  replaced,  in  the  model  of  Prohofsky  and  co-workers,  the  harmonic 

stacking interaction between two successive bases by an anharmonic one and showed that this 

leads  to  denaturation  curves  in  better  agreement  with  experiment  [9].  The  DPB  model  was 

subsequently  used  to  unravel  several  aspects  of  homogeneous  DNA  dynamics  (for  a  recent 

review see Ref. [10]). 

 

The DPB model does however not take into account the fact that stacking interactions 

necessarily  vanish  when  two  successive  bases  have  slid  on  each  other  far  enough  for  their 

rings not to be superposed any longer. Therefore, we recently proposed another expression for 

the nearest-neighbour staking interaction, which is based on the finite propagation enthalpies 

used  in  thermodynamic  calculations  [6],  and  showed  that  the  finiteness  of  the  nearest-

neighbour  potential  is  sufficient  to  induce  a  first-order  phase  transition  at  the  melting 

temperature  [11].  Moreover,  we  showed  that  this  model  reproduces  correctly  the  multi-step 

denaturation process, which is experimentally observed for inhomogeneous DNA sequences 

of length 1000-10000 bp [11]. This had never been achieved before with a dynamical model 

 

3 

and  indicates  that  site-specific  stacking  interactions  are  a  fundamental  ingredient  for  the 

correct dynamical description of inhomogeneous DNA sequences. 

 

Despite these encouraging results, the model of Ref. [11] is still pretty rough. To our 

mind,  its  two  principal  defects  are  both  related  to  the  low  number  of  degrees  of  freedom 

which are taken into account. Indeed, a single particle describes a complete monomer, that is, 

a  particular  base  and  the  attached  sugar  and  phosphate  groups,  while  the  bases  and  the 

backbones necessarily have quite different dynamics. Moreover, the model assumes that the 

unstacking of two successive bases and the separation of the two strands are both governed by 

the  same  (essentially  stretching)  coordinate,  whereas  one  might  reasonably  expect,  in 

agreement with the older models [7], that rotation of the bases perpendicular to the sequence 

axis plays an important role in the unstacking process. The purpose of this Letter is to propose 

an advance of the model of Ref. [11], which accommodates more properly these two points, 

and to show, through molecular dynamics simulations, that the improved model still displays 

the correct melting behaviour. 

 

The  improved  model  is  schematized  in  Fig.  1.  Each  backbone  is  represented  by  an 

array of point masses m tied together by springs. A point mass m thus describes a phosphate 

group plus a sugar group - but not a base. In order to limit the number of degrees of freedom, 

the point masses m are regularly spaced along the sequence axis z and can move only along 

the axis x, which connects the two backbones.  nx  and 

nX  indicate the respective locations 

along  the  x  axis  of  the  nth  point  mass  of  each  backbone.  The  bases  are  represented  by  two 

other sets of point masses M, each point mass M being rigidly attached to a phosphate/sugar 

point mass m. While the distance R between a base and the phosphate/sugar group to which it 

is  attached  is  fixed,  the  base  is  allowed  to  rotate  in  the  plane 

yx
,(

)

  perpendicular  to  the 

sequence axis z. The position of each base thus depends on the torsion angle  nγ  (respectively 

nΓ ) in addition to the translation coordinate  nx  (respectively 

nX ). Two neighbouring bases 

 

4 

belonging  to  the  same  strand  interact  together  through  a  finite  nearest-neighbour  stacking 

potential  similar  to  that  of  Ref.  [11],  while  two  paired  bases  located  on  opposite  strands 

interact through the usual Morse potential. This is however not sufficient. At this point, there 

is  indeed  nothing  that  prevents  the  double-stranded  DNA  sequence  from  folding.  A  term, 

which maintains the four point masses at position n more or less aligned up to the dissociation 

threshold  of  the  Morse  potential,  must  therefore  be  introduced  in  order  to  prevent  this 

unphysical behaviour. This term mimics the action of the two or three hydrogen bonds, which 

connect each pair of bases along different directions and efficiently prevent folding. Denoting

A  simplified  form  has  been  assumed  for  kinetic  energy  T,  so  that  a  second-order  Brünger-

Brooks-Karplus  integrator  can  be  used  in  molecular  dynamics  simulations  (see  below).  The 

first term in the right-hand side of the potential energy V is the Morse potential, which models 

the  hydrogen  bonds  that  connect  a  base  pair.  The  second  term  prevents  folding  of  the  two 

strands,  as  discussed  just  above.  The  third  and  fourth  terms  describe  the  nearest-neighbour 

 

5 

stacking interactions between successive bases belonging to the same strand. Finally, the last 

term represents the elastic energy of the two phosphate/sugar backbones. 

 

As in Ref. [11], the finite stacking enthalpies 

, which range from 0.347 to 0.465 

)(nH∆

eV, are borrowed from thermodynamics studies, more precisely from Table 1 of Ref. [6]. The 

values of most of the other parameters are either derived from known chemical data : m=180 

amu,  M=130  amu, 

0d =4  Å,  R=7  Å  and  b=0.05  Å-2,  or  transferred  from  similar  models  : 

D=0.05 eV and a=3.5 Å-1 [9-11]. On the other hand, 

bK =0.5 eV and 

sK =0.2 eV Å-2 were 

roughly adjusted by hand in order that the denaturation curves obtained from the model agree 

with experiment. In order to indicate to what extent the results presented below are sensitive 

to  the  values  of  these  parameters,  let  us  mention  that  assuming 

bK =0.1  eV  (resp. 

bK =1.0 

eV),  instead  of 

bK =0.5  eV,  decreases  (resp.  increases)  the  melting  temperature  of  all 

sequences  by  about  40  K. 

bK   should  consequently  be  taken  in  the  range  0.1-0.6  eV. 

Similarly,  assuming 

sK =0.1  eV  Å-2  instead  of 

sK =0.2  eV  Å-2  decreases  the  difference 

between the melting temperatures of homogeneous AT and GC sequences from 40 K down to 

25 K (see below). 

sK  is therefore rather rigidly determined for given values of the parameters 

of the Morse oscillator. 

 

The  denaturation  dynamics  of  the  model  of  Eq.  (1)  was  studied  numerically  by 

integrating  Langevin's  equations  of  motion  with  a  second-order  Brünger-Brooks-Karplus 

integrator  [12].  This  recurrence  relation  connects  the  values  taken  by  each  coordinate

/(2

the  right-hand  side  of  Eq.  (2)  model  the  effects  of  the  solvent  on  the  DNA  sequence. 

Calculations  were  performed  with  a  time  step  τ=10  fs,  that  is,  about  one  hundredth  of  the 

period of the Morse oscillator at low temperature. We checked on a few points that reduction 

of  τ  by  a  factor  ten  does  not  change  the  results  presented  below.  Assumed  value  for  the 

dissipation coefficient is γ=5 ns-1. Although the results presented below may well depend on 

this value - for example, the sequence cannot be heated to sufficiently high temperature if γ is 

too large -, we did not investigate in detail the influence of γ on the present model. 

 

The profiles at various temperatures for a 1793 bp ATATAT... sequence and the 1793 

bp inhomogeneous sequence with NCBI entry code NM_001101 are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, 

respectively.  Each  profile  displays,  as  a  function  of  the  base  position  n,  the  average  of 

d n −

0d

 over 0.15 µs integration times. It is seen in Fig. 2 that, as expected, the profiles of the 

ATATAT... sequence are essentially flat, except for the base pairs located close to the ends of 

the  sequence,  which  open  at  slightly  lower  temperatures.  Because  of  the  sharpness  of  the 

transition, 

d n −

0d

 increases much more rapidly with temperature close to the denaturation 

threshold than at lower temperatures. 

 

Comparison  of  the  two  plots  of  Fig.  3  indicates  that  the  profiles  of  inhomogeneous 

sequences are not flat but reflect instead the local AT percentage : remember that the higher 

the  content  of  A  and  T  bases  in  two  successive  base  pairs,  the  lower  the  stacking  enthalpy 

)(nH∆

 [6]. More precisely, the bottom plot of Fig. 3 shows the AT percentage averaged over 

40  consecutive  base  pairs  of  the  sequence.  This  percentage  globally  increases  from  n=1  to 

n=1793, with three local maxima at n≈1300, n≈1450 and n≈1600. Examination of the profiles 

 

7 

in  the  top  plot  shows  that  melting  correspondingly  starts  in  narrow  regions  centred  around 

these  three  peaks,  while  the  sequence  abruptly  melts  for  all  n≥1000  at  slightly  higher 

temperatures.  One  then  observes  a  plateau  of  about  3-4  K  before  the  lower  end  of  the 

sequence  sharply  melts.  Note  that  these  domains  are  in  excellent  agreement  with  those 

obtained from statistical mechanics calculations (see Fig. 2 of ref. [13]). 

 

Current experiments are not able to provide as detailed information as the profiles of 

Figs.  2  and  3.  Nonetheless,  extinction  curves  obtained  from  UV  absorption  spectroscopy 

around 270 nm can be compared directly with the calculated curves for the fraction of open 

base pairs (see Ref. [6] and references therein). While the distinction between closed and open 

base pairs lies at the heart of statistical models, these concepts need to be defined somewhat 

arbitrarily for dynamical models. After some trials, we found that a reasonable and convenient 

choice consists in considering that the base pair at site n is closed as long as 

d n

− d

0 ≤

9

 Å 

and  open  when 

d n

− d

0 >

9

  Å.  The  threshold  value  of  9  Å  corresponds  to  the  situation 

where the four point masses describing site n have remained aligned but the distance between 

the two backbones has increased by 50% (i.e. from the equilibrium value of 18 Å up to 27 Å), 

or, alternatively, to the situation where the distance between the two backbones has remained 

fixed  to  18  Å  but  the  paired  bases  have  rotated  by  45°  in  opposite  directions  or  70°  in  the 

same direction. The threshold value of 9 Å is indicated by an horizontal dash-dotted line in 

Figs. 2 and 3. 

 

The  denaturation  curves  obtained  with  this  criterion  are  shown  as  empty  circles 

connected  by  solid  lines  in  Fig.  4  for  the  two  1793  bp  sequences  of  Figs  2  and  3  (i.e.  an 

ATATAT... sequence and the inhomogeneous sequence with NCBI entry code NM_001101), 

as well as a 1793 bp GCGCGC... sequence. As for Figs. 2 and 3, each point was obtained by 

averaging 

d n −

0d

 over 0.15 µs integration times. This figure shows that the model of Eq. (1) 

 

8 

successfully reproduces the four principal properties of experimental denaturation curves : (i) 

melting  of  homogeneous  sequences  occurs  in  very  narrow  temperature  windows,  (ii)  the 

melting temperatures of pure AT and pure GC sequences are separated by a gap of about 40 

K,  (iii)  the  melting  temperature  of  inhomogeneous  sequences  is  proportional  to  the  AT  (or 

GC)  percentage,  (iv)  denaturation  of  inhomogeneous  sequences  occurs  through  a  series  of 

jumps.  This  confirms  that  use  of  sequence-specific  stacking  interactions  is  of  primary 

importance for the correct description of the dynamics of inhomogeneous DNA sequences. 

In order to show that the 9 Å threshold is by no means critical, we also plotted in Fig. 

4 the denaturation curves obtained with 6 Å (×  symbols) and 12 Å (crosses) thresholds. It is 

seen  that  these  values  essentially  shift  the  denaturation  curves  to,  respectively,  lower  and 

higher  temperatures  by  a  couple  of  Kelvins.  Moreover,  the  jumps  are  slightly  less  marked 

with the 12 Å criterion. 

Before  concluding,  let  us  finally  note  that  calculations  indicate  that  there  is  a  slight 

interval between the temperature where all the base pairs are considered to be open and the 

temperature  where  the  two  strands  separate  effectively.  Indeed,  in  the  former  case,  the time 

average of 

d n −

0d

 must be larger than the 9 Å threshold for all n, while, in the later case, all 

d n −

0d

  must  be  larger  than  9  Å  simultaneously.  The  difference  between  the  two 

temperatures is pretty small (1-2 K) for the inhomogeneous and GCGCGC... sequences, but 

reaches  5-6  K  for  the  ATATAT...  sequence  (see  Fig.  2).  The  last  point  drawn  at  the  high-

temperature end of each plot of Fig. 4 corresponds precisely to the temperature where the two 

strands first separate. 

In  conclusion,  we  have  proposed  a  dynamical  model  for  the  secondary  structure  of 

DNA, which is based on the finite stacking enthalpies used in thermodynamics calculations 

and has the correct behaviour at the denaturation transition. This model is an advance of our 

previous  work  [11],  because  the  backbones  are  clearly  separated  from  the  bases,  which  are 

 

 

 

 

9 

allowed  to  rotate  perpendicular  to  the  sequence  axis.  Of  course,  this  improvement  requires 

that a larger number of degrees of freedom be considered, that is, 4N for a sequence of length 

N.  It  is  now  tempting  to  include  the  tertiary  structure  of  DNA  in  the  model  and/or  to 

investigate  to  what  extent  this  kind  of  model  can  be  used  to  study  the  interaction  of  DNA 

sequences with other molecules with specific biological role.

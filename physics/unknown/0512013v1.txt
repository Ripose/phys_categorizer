Abstract.  We  present  an  introduction  to  special  relativity  kinematics  stressing  the  part 
played by clocks synchronized following a procedure proposed by Einstein. 
 
A. Special relativity with clock synchronization 
 
A.1. Introduction 
 
A.1.1 The event and its space-time coordinates.  
 
The concept of event is of fundamental importance to special relativity 
 
theory. We define it as any physical phenomenon that take place at a given 
point  in  space  at  a  given  time.  We  define  the  point  where  the  event  takes 
place by its space coordinates (Cartesian or polar) and the time when it takes 
place  by  the  reading  of  a  clock  located  at  that  point  when  the  event  takes 
place.  The  physicist  who  observes  nature  by  conducting  experiments  is  by 
definition an observer. He knows the laws of nature by heart and he is able 
to operate measuring devices. Einstein’s observers work as a team. At each 
point  in  space  we  find  such  an  observer.  A  first  type  of  observer  collects 
information  about  the  events  that  take  place  immediately  in  front  of  him. 
Knowing  his  location  in  space  using  meter  sticks  and  using  a  clock  he 
characterizes an event by the space coordinates defining his location in space 
and by a time coordinate that equates the reading of his clock when the event 
takes  place.  For  more  clarity,  let  say  that  the  clock  defined  above  is  the 
observer’s wrist watch. Another type of observer collects information about 
the  space-time  coordinates  of  events  that  take  place  remotely  at  different 
points in space from the light signals that arrive at his location1,2 or from the 
light signal that he sends out and receives back after reflection on a mirror 
located where the event takes place3,4. 
 
 
The observer works in a laboratory. He can be confined to it or he can 
be  an  astronomer  who  contemplates  the  sky.  The  observer  attaches  a 
reference  frame  K(XOY)  to  his  laboratory  that  represents  its  rest  frame 
(Figure 1a). We say that the laboratory and the reference frame attached to it 
are  inertial  if  when  an  object  at  rest  is  placed  at  an  arbitrary  point,  it  will 
continue  to  stay  there.  The  reference  frame  enables  the  observer  to  assign

space  coordinates  to  the  points  where  events  take  place.  The  position  of 
point  M    is  defined,  in  a  two  space  dimensions  approach,  by  its  Cartesian 
(x,y) and by its polar ( θ,r
 
 
 
 

) space coordinates related by

A.1.2 The relativistic postulates 
 
 
Consider two inertial reference frames K(XOY) and K’(X’O’Y’). The 
corresponding  axes  of  the  two  frames  are  parallel  to  each  other,  the 
OX(O’X’) axes are overlapped and K’ moves with constant speed V in the

positive  direction  of  the  OX(O’X’)  axes.

observer 
 at rest in K’ and located at its origin 
the wrist watch of an observer 
O’. When the two origins O and O’ are located at the same point in space the 
watches  are  set  to  read  a zero time. We say that under such conditions the 
two reference frames are in the standard arrangement. We can achieve this 
by  placing  a  source  of  light  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  stopped  clock 
0C′  stopped as well comes along the OX axis. Both clocks display

  and  respectively
 
perform  measurements  in  order  to  find  out  the  physical  properties  of  a 
physical system. The result of a physical measurement is a physical quantity 
and  we  express  it  as  a  product  of  a  numerical  value  and  a  physical  unit

(where  S.I.  units  are  usually  preferred).  The  reference  frame  relative  to 
which  the  physical  system  is  in  a  state  of  rest  represents  its  rest  frame.  A 
proper  physical  quantity  represents  the  result  of  a  measurement  performed 
on a physical system by observers at rest relative to it. 
Special relativity theory becomes involved when we try to establish a 
 
relationship  between  the  physical  quantities,  characterizing  the  same 
physical  system,  as  measured  by  observers  of  K  and  respectively  K’.  An 
equation  that  mediates  these  physical  quantities  is  a  transformation 
equation. A physical quantity that has the same magnitude when measured 
from  different  inertial  reference  frames  represents  a  relativistic  invariant. 
Performing measurements on the same physical object we obtain  a variety 
of  physical  quantities.  An  equation  that  mediates  a  relationship  between 
them represents a physical law. Established in a given reference frame, a law 
mediates the magnitudes of different physical quantities that characterize the 
physical properties of the same physical object measured in that frame. If we 
perform  the  transformation  of  each  physical  quantity  present  in  a  physical 
law  in  accordance  with  its  transformation  equation  and  the  algebraic 
structure of the law does not change, we say that it is covariant with respect 
to  all  the  transformation  equations,  which,  in  this  case,  constitute  a  group.
 
The derivation of a  transformation equation starts with the statement 
of Einstein’s postulates on which special relativity theory is based: 
 
First postulate 
1)  Observation of physical phenomena by more then one inertial observer 
must  result  in  agreement  between  the  observers  as  to  the  nature  of 
reality,  or  the  nature  of  the  universe  must  not  change  for  inertial 
observers in relative motion. 

2)  Every  physical  theory  should  look  the  same  mathematically  to  every 

inertial observer. 

3)  No  property  of  the  universe  will  change  if  the  observer  is  in  uniform 
motion.  The  laws  of  the  universe  are  the  same  regardless  of  inertial 
reference frame. 

4)  A student who has studied physics in the inertial laboratory of a given 
university  will  pass  the  exam  at  each  other  laboratory  moving 
uniformly relative to the first one. 
It  is  impossible,  by  experiments  performed  confined  in  an  inertial 
reference frame, to decide if the frame is in a state of rest or in a state of 
uniform motion along a straight line. 

5)

6) 

If the reference frame K’ moves with constant velocity V in the positive 
direction  of  the  OX  axis,  then  K  moves  with  constant  velocity  –V  
relative to K’ in the negative direction of the same axis. 

7)  Distances  measured  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  relative  motion 
have  the  same  magnitude  in  all  inertial  reference  frames  in  relative 
motion.5 The simplest explanation of this consists of the fact that, in the 
case  of  the  standard  arrangement,  the  relative  velocity  has  no 
component in the normal direction and so we consider that

The  first  postulate  is  an  essential  extension  of  Galileo’s  postulate  in  which 
most physicists hardly believe. 
 
Second postulate 
1)  The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted as c, is the same in 
all directions and does not depend on the velocity of the object emitting 
the light. 

(1.4) 

 

 
 
As a corollary, we argue that when performing an experiment the physicist is 
confronted  with  the  universe.  The  universe  defends  itself,  preventing  the 
observers  from  obtaining  results  beyond  certain  limits  imposed  by  the 
accuracy  and  capabilities  of  the  available  measurement  devices,  some  of 
these restrictions being actually described by the Einstein’s postulates. 
 
Ockham6 teaches us that if two theories explain the facts equally well, 
 
then the simpler theory is the better one. Paraphrasing Ockham, we say that 
if  the  same  theory  explains  the  same  fact  equally  well,  then  the  shorter 
explanation is the better one. Our teaching experience convinced us that it is 
easier  to  teach  those  who  know  nothing  about  the  subject  than  those  with 
wrong previous representations about it.  
 
 
For an easier comprehension of this paper it is essential for the reader 
to  admit  the  Einstein’s  postulates  even  if  they  potentially  challenge  some 
instinctual  belief  developed  during  previous  study  of  physics.  The 
acceptance of these postulates is supported by many experiments performed 
in  last  years  as  well  as  by  the  fact  that  until  today  no  experiment  was 
possible conducted to contradict these postulates.7,8

A.1.3 The light clock and the other clocks associated with it. Time 

 
dilation and length contraction 
 
A clock is a physical device that generates a periodic phenomenon of 
constant  period  T.  The  best  known  clock  for  relativistic  experiments  is  the 
light clock.9 We present it in its rest frame K’ (Figure 1b). The clock consists 
2M ′   parallel  to  the  common  OX(O’X’)  axes  and 
of  two  mirrors 
located  at  a  distance  d  from  each  other.  A  light  signal  originating  from

2M ′  and finally returns to the location 
of 

1M ′  is reflected back by mirror 

1M ′ . The time interval

The invariance of the speed of light in vacuum c and of distances measured 
perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  relative  motion  makes  such  a  clock  very 
tempting for relativistic speculations. Usually the authors fail to mention that 
we  can  attach  to  the  experimental  device  described  above  a  second  clock

The equations derived above enable observers of the two frames to 
 
measure the length of a moving rod. Consider a rod at rest in K and located 
along the common OX(O’X’) axes with one of its ends 1(0,0) located at the 
origin O. The length of the rod, measured by observers of its rest frame K, 
represents its proper length 0L . The position of the second end of the rod is

we obtain that the proper length 
0L  and the measured length  L  are related by

It is important to underline that the time dilation formula relates a 
proper time interval and a non-proper time interval. It involves synchronized 
clocks  only  in  the  reference  frame  where  the  non-proper  time  interval  is 
measured. The time dilation phenomenon loses most of its mystery once we 
recognize  that  it  is  basically  the  consequence  of  comparing  successive 
readings in a given clock with readings in two different clocks. 
 
A.1.4 The Lorentz-Einstein transformations (LET) 
 
 
Due  to  the  relative  character  of  some  physical  quantities,  we  are 
not  allowed  to  represent  physical  quantities  measured  in  different  inertial 
reference frames in relative motion on the same space diagram. With this in

frames K and K’ as detected from K when the synchronized clocks of that 
frame read  t . A rod of proper length 
 at rest in K’ is located along 
L

We  have  derived  the  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations  for  the

the overlapped axes when clocks

practical point of view (1.35) and (1.36) enable observers from K’ to express 
) of an event that takes place in K as a function of 
the space coordinates ( 0,x
)  of  the  same  event  as  detected  from  their 
the  space-time  coordinates  (

the same way.

The  Lorentz-Einstein 

 
 
involve 
synchronized  clocks  in  the  inertial  reference  frames  involved,  K  and 
respectively  K’.  Using  different  teaching  strategies,  authors  derive  the 
formulas  that  describe  time  dilation  and  length  contraction  starting  with 
them  as 
thought  experiments,  as  we  did,  whereas  others  present 
consequences of the Lorentz-Einstein transformations10. 
 
 
We  consider  that  the  single  well  defined  physical  quantities  with 
 
which  special  relativity  operates  are  the proper  length  and  the  proper  time 
interval.  All  the  other  concepts  like  measured  length  and  measured  time 
interval  depend  on  the  measurement  procedure and  so  we  could  detect  not 
only length contraction but also length dilation and not only time dilation but 
also time contraction.  
 
A.1.5 Conclusions 
 
 
Underlining the part played by synchronized clocks of the Einstein 
type of observers we have derived the fundamental equations of relativistic 
kinematics in a compact way and from a little number of scenarios.

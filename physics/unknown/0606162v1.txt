Thick  GEM-like  (THGEM)  electrodes  are  robust,  high  gain  gaseous  electron  multipliers,  economically-manufactured  by 
standard drilling and etching of thin printed circuit board or other materials. Their operation and structure are similar to that of 
standard GEMs but with 5 to 20-fold expanded dimensions. Due to the larger hole dimensions they provide up to 105 and 107 
charge  multiplication,  in  a  single-  and  in  two-electrode  cascade,  respectively.  The  signal  rise  time  is  of  a  few  ns  and  the 
counting-rate capability approaches 10 MHz/mm2 at 104 gains. Sub-mm localization precision was demonstrated with a simple, 
delay-line based 2D readout scheme. These  multipliers  may be produced in a variety of shapes and sizes and can operate in 
many gases. They may replace the standard GEMs in many applications requiring very large area, robust, flat, thin detectors, 
with  good  timing  and  counting-rate  properties  and  modest  localization.  The  properties  of  these  multipliers  are  presented  in 
short and possible applications are discussed.     

 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The 

thick  GEM-like  (THGEM)  gaseous  electron 
multiplier (figure 1) was first introduced a couple of years 
ago [1] and its operation was systematically studied [2, 3], 
both  at  atmospheric  and  at  low  gas  pressures.  This 
multiplier,  described  in  detail  in  [2],  is  similar  to  the 
standard GEM but with dimensions expanded 5 to 20 fold. 
The  thickness  t,  holes’  diameter  d  and  holes’  distance  a, 
may be chosen according to the application and to the gas 
operation  pressure.  The  THGEM  operation  parameters, 
however,  do  not  scale  in  proportion,  because  the  charge 
transport  and  multiplication  process  are unaffected.  Thus, 
the  electron  transport  into  and from  the  THGEM holes  is 
much more efficient compared to GEM; the multiplication 
in  a  single  element  is  10-100  times  higher  (reaching  105) 
and  the  cascaded  operation  mode  is  very  efficient, 
reaching  gains  of  up  to  107  with  single  electrons.  The 
signal rise-time is of a few ns and counting rate capability 
is  almost  10  MHz/mm2  at  104  gain  [2].  The  energy 
resolution  for  6  keV  x-rays  (~20%  FWHM)  is  similar  to 
that  of  GEM.  With  1mm  distance  between  the  holes,  a 
localization  precision  better  than  a  mm  is  obtained. 
THGEM-based multipliers are particularly suitable for the 
efficient  detection  and  imaging  of  single  photoelectrons 
photo-produced  on  a  solid  photocathode  coupled  to  the 
THGEM  or  directly  deposited  on  its  top  face  [4].  It  was 
demonstrated that single electrons, originating from a gas 
ionization gap or from a photocathode deposited on the top 
of the THGEM, are efficiently detected under much more 
relaxed  conditions  compared  to  standard  GEM  (e.g.  10-
100 times lower THGEM gain).   

To  complete  the  study  of  the  THGEM  basic  properties 
we have recently investigated the localization capability of 
THGEM-based detectors, their gain homogeneity and their 
long-term  stability;  some  of  the  results  will  be  presented 
here.  We  further  discuss  some  possible  applications  of 
THGEM-based  detectors, 
large-area  and 
robustness  are  important  and  sub-mm  localization  is 
acceptable.

2.  DETECTORS GAIN AND HOMOGENEITY 

The  reader  is  referred  to  [2]  for  data  on  the  effective 
gain of single- and cascaded THGEM elements of various 
dimensions,  in  Ar/CH4(95:5)  and  Ar/CO2(70:30).  These 
data  were  measured  with  small  THGEM  electrodes  of 
typically 3x3cm2 active surface 

The  gain  homogeneity  and  the  localization  resolution 
were  studied  with  a  10x10  cm2  double-THGEM  detector 
(figure  2)  irradiated  with  8  keV  x-rays.  It  comprised  two 
THGEM  electrodes  of  t=0.4mm,  d=0.5mm  and  a=1mm. 
They were coupled to a resistive anode (~2MOhm/square) 
that transmitted the induced signals and broadened them to 
match the 2mm pitch of the X-Y readout electrode behind 
it.  The  latter  was  a  double  sided  circuit  with  connected 
pads, equipped with discrete delay-lines. The detector was 
operated  with  Ar/CH4  (95:5)  at  mean  gain  104.  The  gain 
variation  was  of  FWHM=10%  over  the  whole  surface.  
The  detector's  anode  and  readout  electrode  are  similar  to 
that described in [5].

 The long-term stability was mostly studied with 3x3cm2 
single-  and  double-THGEM  multipliers  coupled  to  a  CsI 
photocathode  and  illuminated  with  UV  light.  It  permitted 
to  follow  the  total  current  evolution  with  impinging 
electron flux of  up  to 5·105  e-/s·mm2,  which  is  equivalent 
to  1  KHz/mm2  6  keV  x-rays.  Some  results  are  shown  in 
figure  3.  They  indicate  at  a  stabilization  time  which 
depends on the history of the electrode (i.e. being the first, 
second  or  third  measurement  cycle);  it  increases  with  the 
total charge, namely the product of the impinging flux and 
the multiplier gain. The stabilization time is typically 5-12 
hours with a THGEM of t=0.4mm, d=0.3mm and a=1mm. 
It  is  significantly  shorter with d=0.6mm.  The dependence 
on the total charge and on the geometry indicates that this 
is mostly due to charging-up of the insulator surface of the 
electrode  exposed  to  ions  impact.  The  dependence on  the 
electrode history is still not clear and it might be connected 
to surface adsorbents such as water.     

The  2D  imaging  properties  were  studied  with  the 
10x10cm2 detector described above, irradiated with 8 keV 
x-rays,  and  with  the  help  of  various  masks.  Fig  4  shows 
the raw image accumulated with a standard line-pair mask, 
while  figure  5  gives  the  modulation  transfer  function 
derived  from  these  data.  It  is  obvious  that  sub-mm 
localization  resolution  was  obtained  with  the  THGEM  of 
1mm holes pitch. Recent measurements with an edge mask 
provided  the  edge  spread  function  from  which  a  point 
spread function of FWHM=0.33mm was derived.

SUMMARY AND POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS 

The  THGEM  multiplier  is  a  robust,  low-cost  electrode, 
which may be manufactured with very large area out of a 
variety  of  insulating  materials  with  standard  (or  other) 
drilling  and  etching  techniques.  It  provides  very  large 
multiplication  factors,  up  to  105  in  a  single  element  and 
107  in  a  double-THGEM  cascade.  These  higher  gains, 
compared  for  example  to  that  of  the  G-10  "optimized 
GEM"  [6]  result  from  the  etched  area  around  the  hole's 
rim.  The  signals  are  of  a  few  ns  rise  time  and  the  rate 
capability is in the range of a few MHz/mm2. Localization 
resolution  better  than  a  mm  (Point  spread  function 
0.33mm)  was  recorded  with  1mm  holes  pitch  and  with 
simple interpolative delay-line readout.  

There  are  several  applications  in  various  fields  that 
employ  for  example  GEM  electrodes  but  in  fact  do  not 
require  their  very  precise  localization  resolution  and  can 
tolerate the 0.4mm thick insulator material of the THGEM. 
For  these  applications  the  THGEM  may  offer  a  very 
attractive  alternative  solution,  at  lower  cost  and  better 
robustness:  
•  Particle  tracking  at  sub-mm  resolutions,  such  as 

muon-detectors at the LHC upgrade. 

•  TPC readout. 
•  Sampling elements in calorimetry, e.g. for the ILC. 
•  Moderate-resolution,  fast  (ns)  X-ray  and  neutron 

imaging. 

•  Readout  of  scintillation  light  in  LXe  detectors  (e.g. 

XENON collaboration). 

•  Single-photon imaging, e.g. Ring Imaging Cherenkov 
(RICH)  detectors  (presently  done  with  GEMs  for 
example at the HBD for PHENIX upgrade [7]).

Abstract 

DJIA  is  tested  whether  it  can  be  described  as  a  mechanical  system  conserving  total  energy 
with K (=½v2) + U, where U is calculated as the negative of work done by force obtained in 
terms of the second derivative of price, assuming unit mass.

1. Introduction 
 
Market  indices  as  well  as  share  prices,  during  their  time  excursions  pass  through  several 
states; oscillations, rises and falls, crashes (crises), etc. During that time, some quantities may 
remain as conserved, such as total energy. As a result, time series may be predicted epoch by 
epoch, in terms of some simple analytical functions resulting from energy conservation, once 
the  potential  energy  of  the  current  epoch  is  known.  In  this  work  we  will  exemplify  an 
application  of  energy  conservation  theory  (e-ct)  on  DJIA  in  the  “0th-order  approximation”. 
Some  possible  extensions  of  energy  conservation  theory  will  be  pronounced  in  the  final 
section. 
 
 
2.  Energy conservation theory 
 
   The whole history of DJIA, utilizing daily real data [1] can be decomposed into five main 
epochs,  each  with  a  different  length  of  duration.  Refering  to  Fig.  1.  the  first  epoch  is  the 
transitional period lasted about 3565 days from the establishment of the index on. The main 
characteristics of this epoch is (almost) triangular squeezing of prices with the climax meeting 
the  beginning  of  the  Sept.1929  crash  (“Black  Monday”)  at  a  value  of  381.17,  which  ended 
after about 700 days at a value of 41.22, (Fig. 2.). Then a sharp rise occured till the value of 
about  200.  Afterwards  some  decrease  came  reaching  its  deepest  value  at  92.92.  These  two 
successive  local  minima,  i.e.,  41.22  and  92.92  are  very  important  figures  in  the  history  of 
DJIA  since,  the  line  passing  through  them  defines  the  lower  rising  edge  of  the  pronounced 

triangle  and  moreover  the  rightward  extension  of  this  line  plays  the  role  of  carrying 
(supporting)  prices  (i.e.  the  line  passing  through  minima)  for  many  decades,  till  the  value 
increases to nearly 1000. (See, the longest straight line in Fig. 1.) 
   The  pronounced  line  is  in  fact  worth  to  be  considered  as  the  fundamental  line  of  DJIA 
because of several reasons. First of all, it can be taken as the 0th-order approximation for the 
index, since the corresponding time series is observed to evolve about (below and above of) it. 
Secondly  the  fundamental  line,  has  played  the  role  of  supporting  line  till  the  date  of 
16.June.1969 (10,172th day). The day after, i.e. at 17.June.1969 the index has broken it down 
(after  many  previous  hits)  and  later  has  never  crossed  it.  Starting  in  Apr.1999  DJIA  has 
approached it from below many times, (at index values between 11,000 and 11,700) till the 
end  of  the  same  year,  but  has  ceased  to  override  it,  and  the  last  log-periodic  crash  has 
followed. (For detailed studies of this crash, in a power law formalism, see [2-6].) Slope (β) of 
the  present 
to  be  β= 
ln(92.92/41.22)/(3390-946)=0.000333day–1. Therefore, the equation of line can be written as 
 
 
 
the constant χ0 takes care of t=0 value, i.e., the initial price level. χ0 may very well be taken as 
41.22 or 92.92 and the date of the corresponding day will be the origin for time. 
   We have the price velocity and acceleration as v = dχ/dt = βχ, and a = dv/dt = d2χ/dt2 = β2χ, 
respectively,  and  both  increase  exponentially  in  time.  Assuming  m=1[7],  one  may  write  an 
explicit function for  the 0th-order force  
 

χ(t)=χ0exp(0.000333 t)   ,

2). So,  

2) = ½β2(χ2 – χ0

∆U = –½β2 (χ2 – χ0

 
   Once the force is known, one may calculate the work done by this force, along the path of 
Eq.  (1)  that  DJIA  follows  within  the  0th-order  approximation:  ∆W=∫Fdx=∫β2χ  dχ  =  ½β2χ2. 
The  present  indefinite  integral  may  be  converted  into  a  definitine  one  by  substituting  the 
2), which is 
initial χ-value for t=0, and the general term for any t; therefore ∆W = ½β2(χ2 – χ0
nothing but –∆U, by definition. Therefore, 
 
 
 
   Since, v = βχ; then one may calculate the change in kinetic energy in the same journey of 
DJIA, as ∆K= ½ (v2 – v0
 
 
 
   Please note that, Eq. (4) is a result of the exponential growth (Eq. (1)) of DJIA. There might 
be found some other quantities as being conserved during the same time excursion of DJIA, 
and  within  world  market.  With  respect  to  this  possibility,  it  is  better  to  have  a  separation 
between any conservation theory and the current energy conservation theory (e-ct). 
   Energy  conservation  (Eq.  (4))  implies  absence  of  any  frictional  force  or  damping  etc.  on 
DJIA,  along  the  way  under  consideration.  Yet,  DJIA  is  observed  to  deviate  from  its  usual 
exponentially  increasing  path,  and  spend  about  twenty  years  (1962-1982)  below  the  index 
value of 1000. During that time, it bounced up and down many times between the levels of 
750  and  1000  as  displayed  in  Fig.  3.  Inspiring  also  from  the  quadratic  form  of  potential 
energy in Eq. (3), we may approximate this oscillatory mood by a sinusoidal (harmonic) form. 
Utilizing  the  observational  data,  the  following  expression  may  be  proposed  to  represent  the 
third epoch as 

∆U + ∆K = 0 = ∆(U + K)   .

χ(t)epoch 3 = 875 + 125sin((2π/750)(t – t0) – π/2)  , 

 
 
 
where, t = t0 = 0 may be taken at the date of 11.Apr.1963, at an index value of 750, and the 
angular frequency (w) comes out as 2π/750 ≅ 7,02x10-5 day-1. 
   It  can  be  easily  shown  that,  ∆U=  ½(2π/750)2(χ2  –  χ0
2).  Furthermore,  v=βχ,  and  a=β2χ=F 
relations still hold with β2 = –w2. Total energy ET =U + K of an harmonic oscillator is known 
be ½(2π/T)2A2, where T and A stand for period and the amplitude, respectively. Furthermore 
∆E = ∆U + ∆K = 0. Subsituation of the observed data yields ET=0.55 (value/day)2. 
   As a closer investigation on Fig. 3. delivers the fact that, Eq. (5) does not fit the real data 
everywhere.  For  example,  the  minima  of  zigzags  fall  down  twice  below  the  750  level.  And 
about the middle, real maximum occurs when the sinusoidal has its minimum, and vice versa 
right  after  it,  i.e.,  real  minimum  occurs  when  the  sinusoidal  is  at  its  maximum.  Yet,  this 
deviation  may  be  expressed  within  the  present  context  of  energy  conservation;  as  the  real 
period exceeds that of the sinusoidal (750 day), the local amplitude increases, and as a result 
A/T remains the same, conserving totat energy ET=½(2πA/T)2. 
   At the end of the year of 1982, DJIA overcomes the “psychological” resistance of 1000, and 
exponentially  increases  again,  with  a  steeper  slope  of  β=0.000500  day-1,  till  it  hits  the 
fundamental  line  from  below  at  Jan.1999.  During  that  time,  total  energy  (with  U=–  ½  
(0.0005)2χ2) remains constant. Afterwards, the 2000 crash comes. 
   As it can be seen in Fig. 1., nowadays DJIA is at maximum distance from the fundamental 
line, and it seems as if that the distance will continue to increase in close future. The current 
epoch, may be a new transitional one. Yet, one may represent it by a gravitational potential 
energy [7]. 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
The three epochs out of five, are shown to involve a quadratic potential energy in the 0th-order 
approximation.  Conservation  of  total  energy  is  proved  in  terms  of  real  data  χ  only.  Force 
equations are obtained for the three median epochs. For finer details of the excursion of DJIA, 
some  more  potential  terms  may  be  added,  solutions  of  which  can  be  obtained  via 
perturbational techniques as 1st- and higher-order approximations to DJIA. The existing U and 
K scales by some arbitrary λ2, whereas χ, v, and a scales by λ, proving a power law. 
   Furthermore,  once  the  potential  and  total  energies  are  obtained  (e.g.  for  exponential 
behavior  U  and  ET  will  be  –½β2χ2  and  zero,  respectively;  for  oscillations  U=+½β2χ2,  and 
ET=2(πA/T)2, and for azimuthal rises and falls U=h1χ, and ET= h1χ0) one may try Lagrangian 
and even wave mechanical solutions. Just to exemplify, for exponential growth we will have 
{(–½ħ2)(d2/dχ2) – ½β2χ2}ψ = 0, for oscillations we will have {(–½ħ2)(d2/dχ2) + ½β2χ2}ψ = 
2(πA/T)2ψ, and for azimuthal rises and falls we will have {(–½ħ2)(d2/dχ2) + h1χ}ψ = h1χ0ψ. 
Furthermore, application of boundary conditions may yield some kind of quantization in some 
quantities.

Fig.  1.  DJIA,  with  a  logarithmic  price  axis.  Five  fundamental  epochs  composing  its  history 
can be selected. The first “transitional” epoch is characterized by its triangular squeezing the 
price  about  the  first  “psychological  resistance”  of  the  value  of  100.  In  the  second  and  the 
fourth epochs log-linear (i.e., exponential) ascending of the price can be distinguished (arrows 
1 and 2). In the third epoch, just below the second “psychological resistance” of the value of 
1,000 oscillations are dominant. In the fifth, and the final epoch, the evolution of formation 
(about the third “psychological resistance” of 10,000 index) is not completed yet.  
 
Fig. 2.  The first transitional epoch in DJIA. Notice the supporting line, rightward extention of 
which displays that it is fundamental for DJIA. 
 
Fig.  3.  The  third,  (oscillatory)  epoch  of  DJIA.  When  the  time  difference  between  any 
successive hits to the supporting level of 750 (i.e., the period T) increases, the amplitude (A) 
also increases. As a result A/T ratio, and ET remains the same.

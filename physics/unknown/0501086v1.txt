Abstract

Experimental  observations  are  presented  on  condensed-phase  analogs  of  gas

phase  dipole-bound  anions  and  negatively  charged  clusters  of  polar  molecules.  Both

monomers  and  small  clusters  of  such  molecules  can  reversibly  trap  conduction  band

electrons in dilute alkane solutions. The dynamics and energetics of this trapping have

been studied using pulse radiolysis - transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved

photoconductivity. Binding energies, thermal detrapping rates, and absorption spectra of

excess electrons attached to monomer and multimer solute traps are obtained and possible

structures for these species are discussed. "Dipole coagulation" (stepwise growth of the

solute cluster around the cavity electron) predicted by Mozumder in 1972 is observed.

Acetonitrile monomer is shown to solvate the electron by its methyl group, just like the

1.

alkane solvent does. The electron is dipole-bound to the CN group; the latter points away

from the cavity. The resulting negatively charged species has a binding energy of 0.4 eV

and  absorbs  in  the  infrared.  Molecules  of  straight-chain  aliphatic  alcohols  solvate  the

excess electron by their OH groups; at equilibrium, the predominant electron trap is a

trimer  or  a  tetramer;  the  binding  energy  of  this  solute  trap  is  ca.  0.8  eV.  Trapping  by

smaller  clusters  is  opposed  by  the  entropy  which  drives  the  equilibrium  towards  the

electron  in  a  solvent  trap.  For  alcohol  monomers,  the  trapping  does  not  occur;  a  slow

proton transfer reaction occurs instead. For acetonitrile monomer, the trapping is favored

energetically but the thermal detachment is rapid (ca. 1 ns). Our study suggests that a

composite  cluster  anion  consisting  of  a  few  polar  molecules  imbedded  in  an  alkane

"matrix" might be the closest gas phase analog to the core of solvated electron in a neat

polar liquid.

1. Introduction.

The  way  in  which  the  excess  electron  localizes  in  a  dielectric  fluid  strongly

depends on the nature of the fluid. 1 Henceforward, only liquids constituted of polyatomic

molecules that have no electron affinity are considered. In many such liquids, the excess

electron occupies a void (the solvation cavity) lined by polar (or polarizable) groups of

the solvent molecules; the spreading of the electron density onto the solvent is minor. In

water and aliphatic alcohols, the ground state (s-) electron is confined in a small, nearly

spherical cavity lined by the solvent hydroxyl groups. 2-4 This structure ( esolv

− ) is stabilized

by  Coulomb  attraction  of  the  electron  to  positive  charges  on  hydroxyl  protons.  4  The

binding  energy  of  the  solvated  electron  in  such  liquids  is  1-2  eV  2,4  and  thermal  re-

excitation of this electron to the conduction band (CB) does not occur (though such a

process may occur for excited-state p-electrons). 5 Naturally, nonpolar liquids localize the

excess electron differently, as permanent dipoles in polar groups are absent. In saturated

hydrocarbons, the electrons are trapped in large cavities of ca. 7 Å in diameter (the so-

called "electron bubbles"). 6,7 The electron is stabilized by interaction with polarized C-H

and  C-C  bonds  in  6-8  methyl  groups  that  form  the  solvation  cavity;  8  additional

stabilization  is  provided  by  electron  exchange  9  and/or  sharing  of  the  electron  density

with the solvent molecules. 10 A similar arrangement exists for the solvated electron in the

polar liquid acetonitrile ( MeCN ). 10-13 Although the dipole moment of acetonitrile is large

(3.9-4.1 D vs. 1.6-1.9 D for alcohols),  12 the positive charge resides on the CN carbon

which is not accessible to  esolv

−

. The CN groups point away  from the cavity; the latter is

lined by methyl groups, just like in alkane liquids. 10,13 Since the  MeCN

(

)−
2  anion in neat

acetonitrile is more stable by 450 meV than  esolv

, there is a rapid equilibrium between

−

these two electron states. 10,11,14 Similar equilibria exist for other liquids where more than

one type of electron is present at any time. In a typical alkane, the binding energy  Et  of

3.

the electron is only 180-200 meV and thermal excitation to the CB readily occurs at room

temperature. 6,7 Thus, the electron spends some time in a quasifree state at the bottom of

the CB (for which the drift mobility is as high as 10-100 cm2/Vs), 6,7,15,16 whereas most of

the time it dwells in a trapped state (for which the mobility  µ

f  is only 10-3-10-2 cm2/Vs).

17 For room-temperature n-hexane, the probability of finding the electron in a quasifree

state is low, ca. 3x10-3. 6 For hydrocarbons composed of spherical molecules, e.g., 2,2,4-

trimethylpentane (iso-octane), the binding energy is 50-60 meV (vs. the thermal energy

of 25 meV), 7 and this probability is two orders of the magnitude greater. 7,15,17 In the two-

state model for electron conduction in nonpolar liquids, 6,7,16,17 the apparent drift mobility

What happens to the excess electron in a dilute solution of polar molecules (e.g.,

alcohol  molecules)  in  a  typical  nonpolar  solvent  (e.g.,  n-hexane)?  This  question,

originally  posed  by  Mozumder,  18  still  lacks  complete  resolution.  Since  the  excess

electron is strongly attracted to permanent dipoles in the solute molecules, replacement of

nonpolar solvent molecules by these polar molecules in the solvation shell of the cavity

electron  ("dipole  coagulation")  is  energetically  favorable.  This  trend  is  countered  by

4.

entropy preventing the substitution. Over time, an equilibrium is reached, and a new type

of (solute-)trapped electron emerges. Hereafter, electron "trapping" or "attachment" refers

−{
to  the  formation  of  a  e

Sn solv

  species,  in  which  n ≥ 1 solute  molecules  ( S)  are

included in the first solvation shell of the cavity electron; the solvent molecules are still

included in the cavity. No  Sn

−  anions in which the electron occupies a molecular orbital of

the solute molecule are involved.

Mozumder's  paper  18  outlining  this  scenario  stimulated  a  brief  flurry  of

experimental activity.  19-27  It  was  expected  that  small  electron  clusters,  as  opposed  to

solvated  electrons  in  neat  liquids,  would  be  simple  to  study  and  to  model.  (Similar

expectations were later nurtured for gas phase cluster anions). Electron localization in

dilute solutions of water and alcohols in liquid 19-26 and vitreous e.g., 27 alkanes was studied

using pulse radiolysis - transient absorbance (TA) spectroscopy, 19,20,23,24,27 time-resolved

conductivity,  21-25  and  optically  detected  magnetic  resonance  (ODMR).  26  The  results

obtained in these studies hinted at a complex picture of electron dynamics and the interest

in mixed solvents quickly waned. Nevertheless, a consensus has been reached as to the

mechanism  for  electron  localization  in  such  systems  (section  2.1).  As  shown  in  the

present study, this consensual picture requires revision and clarification. In retrospect,

alcohols were an inopportune choice for the initial studies due to their tendency to form

strongly  bound  multimers.  Our  results  and  analyses  suggest  that  the  interest  in  mixed

solvents was fully justified: such systems do provide a new vista on electron solvation in

2.1. Polar solute traps in alkane solvents.

The  studies  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  19-26  showed  that  in  dilute  solutions  of

hydroxylic molecules (such as alcohols and water) in normal and branched alkanes, the

electrons attach to pre-existing clusters  Sn (multimers) of these solute ( S) molecules.

Note that due to the occurrence of reaction (1), this electron trapping reaction can also be

Individual alcohol and water molecules (the "monomers",  n = 1) do not trap the excess

electrons, and in very dilute (< 1-5 mM) alkane solutions, localized electrons still reside

in solvent traps. By contrast, alcohol clusters present in more concentrated solutions 19-26

bind the electrons quite strongly. H-bonded dimers and higher multimers of hydroxylic

molecules form spontaneously in alkanes by reactions (4)

when the mole fraction  χ of the solute exceeds 10-3. 19,21,25,28 Let  Kn be the equilibrium

constant of reaction (4) for solute concentrations given in mole fractions. For open chain

n-mers of normal alcohols, Stokes 28 obtained  K2=11 (with a standard enthalpy of -21.2

kJ/mol) and  K3 =122.7 and  Kn>3=76 (with a standard heat of -23.5 kJ/mol). Using these

equilibrium constants and enthalpies, it is easy to obtain the concentrations of various

multimers in solution (typical speciation plots are given in Fig. 1S in the Supplement).

Less known is that acetonitrile molecules also form clusters in nonpolar solvents, albeit

less efficiently than the hydroxylic molecules, 

29,30 as the heat of dimerization of  MeCN

between the antiparallel  MeCN

observed.

Sn solv

  species  is

reversible  (as  thermal  emission  of  electrons  into  the  CB  is  still  possible);  for  larger

clusters, the traps are too deep (> 1 eV) to observe this emission within the lifetime of the

electron  species.  20,21,25  The  minimum  size  n   of  the  Sn  cluster  capable  of  reversible

electron trapping is uncertain. Some authors reached the conclusion that alcohol dimers

can trap the electrons. 20,21,26 Others concluded that only tetramers or higher multimers can

trap these electrons (reversibly and irreversibly, respectively).  19,25 For  χ<5x10-2, this

reversible  trapping  decreases  the  apparent  electron  mobility  µ   (by  reducing  the

equilibrium fraction of  eqf

−  via reaction (2)); however, this trapping has almost no effect

on  the  absorption  spectrum  of  the  excess  electron.  19,20,23  At  higher  concentration,  the

absorption  peak  of  the  solvated  electron  shifts  towards  the  blue  and  the  TA  signal

increases several fold. 19,20,23 At the onset of this spectral transformation ( χ ≈ 5x10-2) 19,23

almost  no  quasifree  electrons  are  left  in  the  solution.  20,21  For  χ>0.2-0.3,  the  TA

spectrum resembles that for the electron in neat alcohol: 19,20,23 the substitution of solvent

molecules by the solute in the first solvation shell of the cavity electron is complete. The

lifetime of this electron species (which is a few microseconds) appears to be limited by

proton transfer from the alcohol molecule in the solvation shell, as is also the case in neat

 species should be at least a tetramer.  19 The same

applies  to  solvated  electron  observed  in  water-saturated  alkanes,  20,23  though  the

corresponding spectrum more closely resembles that of the excess electron in dense water

vapor 31 and supercritical water  32 than hydrated electron in liquid water.  2  For  χ>0.1,

there is no evolution of the TA spectra after the 30 ps electron pulse. 19 At lower alcohol

concentrations (for  χ between 0.05 to 0.1) the main effect of the alcohol addition is a

decrease in the decay rate of the TA signal on the sub-nanosecond time scale, which is

the  expected  result  of  lowering  the  electron  mobility.  It  appears  that  electrons  are

scavenged by large alcohol clusters very rapidly (< 30 ps), 19 the rate constant of electron

was observed within the first 500 ps after the formation.  19 In fact, this reaction has not

been observed even on a longer time scale. 20-25 The only observation of a cluster-growth

reaction similar to reaction (5) is by Ahmad et al. 22 who observed, albeit indirectly, slow

(ca. 7x109  M-1 s-1)  complexation  of  methanol  with  the  tentative  water  tetramer  in iso-

octane.

Recently,  it  has  been  demonstrated  33  that  the  electron  in  supercritical  CO2  (in

which  the  excess  negative  charge  is  trapped  as  C2O4

-  anion)  forms  dipole-bound

complexes  with  the  dimers  and  monomers of the alcohols and acetonitrile. In another

publication (see sections 4.1 and 1S in ref. 10) we observed that the electron in n-hexane

can be trapped by a single  acetonitrile  molecule.  The  electron  binding  energy  of  the

the intrinsic solvent trap. 6,7 Ahmad et al. 22 reported reversible trapping of the electron in

iso-octane by monomers of two other nonhydroxylic polar solutes, trimethylamine and

diethyl ether, though the equilibrium constants for electron attachment were very low (ca.

150 and 3.5 M-1, respectively, vs. > 400 M-1 for acetonitrile). 10 Thus, the electron can be

trapped  by  polar  monomers in solvents other than alkanes. Acetonitrile monomers (as

well  as  some  other  polar  molecules  missing  OH  groups)  can  trap  the  electron  in  the

alkanes, but alcohol  molecules  have  to  form  clusters.  In  the  present  paper,  we  further

explore these patterns.

2.2.

Pulse radiolysis of alkanes: some basics.

−{
One  of  the  techniques  used  to  characterize  e

:

}
Sn solv

  species  in  this  study  is

nanosecond pulse radiolysis - TA spectroscopy. It is appropriate to make some general

remarks concerning the radiolysis of neat alkanes and alkane solutions, as such an insight

is needed to interpret the results given in section 4.1 correctly.

In  neat  alkanes,  such  as n-hexane, two radiolytic products are observed several

nanoseconds  after  the  20  MeV  electron  pulse:  trapped  electrons,  which  absorb  in  the

near-  and  mid-  infrared  (IR),  and  olefin  cations,  which  absorb  mainly  in  the  blue  and

ultraviolet (UV) (the ππ∗ band) but also have a spectral extension to the visible (the  σπ∗

band).  34-36 This TA signal can be observed most distinctively in CO2-saturated solution

(see  Fig.  2S(a),  trace  (i)  in  section  4.1)  since  the  TA  signal  from  trapped  electrons  is

removed rapidly by  eqf

−  scavenging (see below); the cation signal is enhanced (Fig. 2S(b))

due  to  the  slowing  of  geminate  recombination  (the  mobility  of  CO2

− << µ ).  The

mechanism for formation of these "satellite cations" (observed as early as 30 ps after the

electron pulse) 36 is still uncertain. 34 Fragmentation of vibrationally excited solvent holes

(that  is,  alkane  radical  cations)  and  intraspur  reactions  of  these  holes  and  olefins

9.

generated via fragmentation of excited solvent molecules are the two most likely routes.

34,37  For  cycloalkanes  (whose  holes  are  very  mobile,  due  to  rapid  resonant  charge

transfer),  34,38 dimer olefin cation is also observed in the red,  35,38 but this species is not

formed in n-alkanes.  35 The excited state of n-hexane (with a yield of 1.6 molecules per

100 eV absorbed energy)  34,39 is short-lived (ca. 300 ps) 39 and its radical cation rapidly

deprotonates (in ca. 2 ns). 40 For iso-octane, the excited state and the hole fragment in <

40 ps, 39,41 which is much shorter than the duration of the 4 ns fwhm electron pulse used

in this study; trapped-electron absorbance in the infrared is also missing as the binding

energy is only 50-60 meV. 7 Recent results from Barbara's group  42 suggest that the TA

signal from photoionized iso-octane observed on the femtosecond time scale 44 is likely to

originate from an excitonic species rather than a trapped electron.

For  neat  n-hexane,  the  Onsager  radius  rc  (at  which  the  Coulomb  interaction

between the geminate partners equals the thermal energy,  k TB

≈25 meV) is ca. 300 Å,

whereas the distribution width for  e−  thermalization path is ca. 70 Å. 44 Thus,  < 3% of

the electrons escape their geminate partner's Coulomb field (become "free") in isolated

pairs (ca. 4 pairs per 100 eV). 44 Consequently, the yield of free solvated electrons is low

(ca. 0.13 per 100 eV), and since their molar absorptivity ( ε

≈ 8,300 M-1 cm-1) 24,45 is

1000

also low, relatively large dose is needed to observe  esolv

 on the nanosecond time scale (to

obtain an absorbance > 10-3). The time scale of geminate recombination is given by the

10.

concentration of (free!) electrons at the end of the electron pulse was ca. 0.6 µM (section

4.1).  Since  the  electron  concentration  for  t

tc

higher  than  that  of  the  free  electrons,  the  loss  of  esolv

  to  bulk  and  intraspur  cross

−

recombination  during  the  geminate  stage  is  substantial.  This  is  not  the  case  in  the

photoconductivity experiments discussed in section 4.2, as the yield of free electrons in

these experiments is very low (< 10 nM). For isolated electron-hole pairs, the yield of

free electrons does not depend on electron mobility; this yield is entirely determined by

the initial electron distribution around the parent hole. 44 Our conductivity measurements

suggest that for dilute solutions of acetonitrile or alcohol in alkanes the free electron yield

indeed does not change due to the occurrence of reactions (2) and (3) (see sections 4.2.1

and 4.2.2, respectively). However, in the dose regime typical of pulse radiolysis - TA

studies 19-24 (as opposed to pulse radiolysis - d.c. conductivity studies), 21-23,25 this is not the

case. Since for alcohols, electron attachment reaction (2) occurs with a rate constant >

1012 M-1 s-1, 25 electron trapping in 0.1 M ethanol occurs well within the geminate stage.

3. Experimental.

Materials:

n-Hexane  (99+%,  Aldrich)  and  iso-octane  (99+%,  Baker)  were  passed

through  activated  silica  gel  to  remove  olefin  impurity.  Biotech  grade  acetonitrile

(99.93+%)  stored  under  N2  and  highest  grade  alcohols  (99.9+%)  and  their  deuterated

analogs  (>98+  atom  %  D)  were  obtained  from  Aldrich  and  were  used  without

purification,  but  without  exposure  to  air.  The  alcohol  and  acetonitrile  solutions  were

deoxygenated by purging with dry nitrogen or argon. All measurements of the electron

mobility and TA were carried out in these N2- or Ar- saturated solutions. Purging these

solution or even moving the liquid between the containers causes substantial loss of the

polar solute to the head space. Gas chromatography was used (samples were taken from

the exit of the cell, with no exposure of the sample to a "head space") to determine solute

concentrations. This monitoring was absolutely necessary: due to the extreme volatility of

polar molecules in dilute hydrocarbon solutions, reproducible results cannot be obtained

otherwise.  Previous  researches  25  reported  similar  problems;  from  our  experience,  the

irreproducibility is always traceable to the solute loss.

Electron mobility.  The  conductivity  setup  was  the  same  as  described  in  our  previous

publication. 6 Fifteen ns fwhm pulses of 248 nm photons from a KrF excimer laser were

used to ionize the solutions via biphotonic excitation. Room temperature solutions were

photolyzed in a cell with a 4 cm optical path. To obtain the temperature dependence, 5

µM  anthracene  solutions  were  photolyzed  in  a  2  cm  path  cell  (photoionization  of  the

anthracene gives higher electron yield compensating for a shorter path). Both cells have

two  planar  Pt  electrodes  spaced  by  6.5  mm  operated  at  4  kV.  For  time-of-flight

conductivity experiments, the electrode spacing was reduced to 800 µm and a 100 µm slit

was used to generate the charges near the electrodes. A 1064 nm beam from a Nd:YAG

laser passed thru the cell in the opposite direction to the 248 nm beam, and completely

enveloped the 248 nm beam inside the cell. The maximum fluence J of 1064 nm photons

through the cell was ca. 1.5 J/cm2 (9x1018 photons/cm2); the fluence of 248 nm light was

< 0.1 J/cm2. The typical (free) electron concentration in our conductivity experiments was

5-10 nM. The lifetime of the electron (< 1 µs) is controlled by an electron-scavenging

impurity. Under our excitation conditions, cross recombination of charges in the bulk and

their  movement  towards  the  electrodes  were  negligible  for  t <1  µs.  The  transient

photocurrent signal was amplified and recorded with a time resolution < 2 ns. The delay

time  tL  of the 1064 nm pulse relative to the 248 nm pulse was 25-800 ns; the time jitter
between  these  two  pulses  was  <  3  ns.  To  determine  the  conductivity  signal  ∆κ t( )

induced by the 1064 nm laser pulse, this laser was pulsed on and off while the 248 nm
on t( )  and  κ t( )  were

laser  was  pulsed  for  every  shot,  and  the  corresponding  signals  κ

subtracted. If not specified otherwise, the measurements were carried out at 23  oC. The

conductivity is given in units of nS/cm (= 10-7 Ω-1 m-1).

Pulse  Radiolysis  -  Transient  Absorbance  (TA).  Room  temperature  solutions  were

radiolyzed using electron pulses from the Argonne LINAC (20 MeV, 4 ns fwhm, 21.5 nC

per pulse). The solutions were placed in a 2 cm optical path cell with Suprasil windows.

The analyzing light from a pulsed Xe arc lamp was coaxial with the electron beam and

traveled in the opposite direction. A set of 10 nm fwhm band pass interference filters (50

nm interval) was used for wavelength ( λ) selection between 0.5 and 1.6 µm. A fast Ge

detector with flat spectral response was used to detect the TA signal on the nanosecond

time scale. Cerenkov light and radiation-induced TA signal from the cell windows (< 10-

irradiated sample vs. the delay time t.

4.1. Pulse Radiolysis.

A typical TA spectrum observed at the end of 4 ns fwhm electron pulse in neat n-

hexane is shown in Fig. 1, trace (i). In the first 200 ns, the electron rapidly decays via a

scavenging  reaction  with  impurity  and  by  homogeneous  recombination;  only  the  TA

signal from the olefin cation (trace (ii) in Fig. 1; see section 2.2) persists at longer delay

13.

times (Fig. 2S(a)). Addition of 4-50 mM of  MeCN  increases the TA signal in the near

infrared ( λ≈ 0.8-2 µm), whereas the relative fraction of the olefin cation at  t ≅50-100 ns

decreases  (Figs.  3S(a)  and  4S).  The  end-of-pulse  spectra  obtained  for  10-50  mM

solutions are very similar (Fig. 4S(a)). For  t >100 ns, some spectral evolution is observed

in  the  visible  (Fig.  4S(b))  where  the  olefin  cation  absorbs.  (The  dimer  anion  of

acetonitrile may also contribute to this TA signal; see section 4.3). As trapped electron

decays, the relative contribution from the olefin cation increases. The plot of the end-of-

pulse TA signal at 1 and 1.55 µm vs. [

MeCN  is given in Fig. 1(b); the slight discrepancy

]

between these two plots is due to the interference from the olefin cation that absorbs at 1

µm (Fig. 1(a)). The TA signal first increases linearly with the increasing  [

MeCN , then
]

"saturates".  For  iso-octane solution, the plot of the 1.55 µm  absorbance  is  linear  with

[

MeCN  to 0.18 M (Fig. 5S(a)). Otherwise, the spectral evolution is similar to that in

]

acetonitrile/n-hexane solutions (compare Figs. 4S and 6S). In both alkane liquids, as the

concentration increases, the decay of the TA signal in the infrared becomes slower. (Fig.

3S(a) and 5S(b)).

Fig. 1(a) shows a comparison between the electron spectra in neat n-hexane, trace

(i) and 50 mM and 75 mM acetonitrile solutions in n-hexane and iso-octane, respectively

(traces (iv) and (v), respectively; the spectral profile does not change further at higher

concentrations). To facilitate the comparison, all of these spectra are normalized at 1.55

µm.  For  neat  n-hexane, the olefin cation signal interferes with the electron signal (see

Fig. 2, trace (ii)), so the direct comparison is difficult. Some compensation can be made

by subtracting the spectrum of olefin cation, trace (ii), from the composite spectrum, trace

(i), assuming that 500 nm absorbance is only from the cation (the difference trace (iii)).

Still it is clear from Fig. 2 that the TA spectrum in acetonitrile solution is less broad than

that  in  neat n-hexane. The increase in the TA signal from the electron with increasing

section 4.2.1, this trapping becomes nearly irreversible on the observation time scale for

MeCN

[

(and, to a lesser degree, geminate) recombination is reduced, which results in a greater

electron yield at the end of the 4 ns electron pulse (section 2.2). The magnitude of this

effect in our dose regime (ca. 2 times) may be estimated by comparing the yield of the

cation absorbance at 500 nm in Ar- and CO2- saturated n-hexane solutions (Fig. 2S(b)).

CO2 rapidly (< 200 ps) scavenges the electron yielding a slowly migrating CO2

- anion.

The TA signal from the electron at  λ= 1 µm increases ca. 5 times in 50 mM acetonitrile

solution. Since there is always a parity between the yields of charges of different sign, it

is possible to crudely estimate that the molar absorptivity of the electron at 1 µm is 2-2.5

times greater than that in neat n-hexane.

For alcohols ( ROH ), the spectral evolution is more complex. In Fig. 2(a), end-of-

pulse  TA  spectra  for  40-260  mM  ethanol  in  n-hexane  are  shown.  (This  system  has

previously  been  studied,  20 although  the  solute  concentrations  were  not  reported).  No

spectral evolution was observed for  t <1  µs, for all ethanol concentrations (e.g., Figs.

7S(a) and 7S(b)). Alcohol monomers and multimers are rapidly protonated by the solvent

holes  and the formation of olefin cations is thereby suppressed. Consequently, there is no

interference  from  these  cations  in  the  TA  spectra.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  also  no

spectroscopic evidence for gradual "dipole coagulation" (reaction (5)) on the nanosecond

time scale, i.e., all electron equilibria settle in < 10 ns (at 23 oC). The increase of the TA

signal at  λ= 1 µm vs. [

ROH  (Fig. 2(b)) is a sigmoid curve similar to that for acetonitrile

]

except  for  low  alcohol  concentrations.  This  difference  is  due  to  the  fact  that  only

multimers can trap the electron in alcohol solutions (sections 2.1 and 4.2.2), whereas even

single acetonitrile molecules can trap these electrons (section 4.2.1). A comparison with

] increases, the decay kinetics (like those for acetonitrile, Fig. 3S(a)) observed on
ROH[

the sub-microsecond time scale slow down (Fig. 3S(b)). For both solutes, this decrease is

significant in dilute solutions (< 20-50 mM); at higher concentrations (when the trapping

becomes irreversible, see section 4.2,1 and 4.2.2) further slowing down of these kinetics

does not occur. The magnitude of the increase in  ∆ODλ for  λ= 1 µm is ca. 9 times for

[

EtOH

] ≈0.26 M (Fig. 2(b)). Since, as noted above, part of this increase (ca. 2 times) is

due to the suppression of recombination, the rough estimate for the increase in the  λ= 1

µm absorptivity of the trapped electron is 4-5 times.

The crucial difference between the acetonitrile and ethanol solutions is that for the
latter solute not only the amplitude of the TA signal increases as  S[ ] increases but also

the spectral profile evolves continuously (Fig. 2(a)). The band maximum shifts from 1.5

µm at 40 mM to 1.1 µm at 73 mM to 0.95-1 µm at 120 mM to 0.8 µm at 262 mM. One

can inquire whether the TA spectra observed at the intermediate ethanol concentrations

can be obtained by addition of weighted spectra observed at the highest and the lowest

ethanol concentration (dotted lines in Fig. 2(a)). Such would be the case if only one kind
of the  (

 species was present in the reaction mixture. Although these weighted

sums can be made close to the spectra observed, this does not seem to be the case (Fig.

2(a)).  This  argues  that  only  a  few  (perhaps,  2-3)  types  of  trapped  electron  species  are

present in the solution at equilibrium, as previously suggested by Gangwer et al.  25 and

others. 20-24 We will return to these observations in section 5.2.

conductivity  κ

i   is  from  ions  that  decay  slowly  (on  the  millisecond  time  scale)  by

recombination in the bulk and neutralization at the electrodes. This residual ion signal

does not depend on the acetonitrile concentration (< 60 mM), suggesting that addition of

acetonitrile has no effect on the electron yield. The conductivity signal  κ

octane.  48  At  these  concentrations,  µ   decreases  >  10  times  vs.  neat  solvents.  The

activation energies for n-hexane and iso-octane are 4.9±0.7 and 32.6±0.4 kJ/mol (for neat

19.

solvents)  and  52.7±2.2  and  45.1±1.3  kJ/mol  (for  MeCN  solutions),  respectively,  from

which  −∆Heq

0  is estimated as 20.1±3 and 48±3 kJ/mol, respectively. Note that in neat n-

hexane, the binding energy for the electron trap is ca. 200 meV, i.e. the binding energy of

acetonitrile trap vs. the CB edge is ca. 400 meV. A better, more reliable estimate for the

same parameter (that does not require making an assumption that the product  µ τ

f   is

temperature-independent)  6,7 can be obtained using 1064 nm (1.17 eV) photon induced

electron detachment, 6 as described below.

Fig.  3  shows  the  effect  of  1064  nm  photoexcitation  on  the  conductivity  signal

from the electron (see also Figs. 9S(a) and 10S(b)). The temporal profile of the difference

signal  ∆κ (section 3) follows the Gaussian profile of the 1064 nm pulse. At all solute

conductivity signal from the electron induced by 248 nm light decays. When the electrons
are  scavenged  (as  κ t( )  decays  to  a  plateau  within  1-5  µs),  1064  nm  light  does  not

produce any increase in the conductivity.  49 This behavior suggests that the  ∆κ signal

originates from 1064 nm photons detaching the electron from the traps and promoting

these electrons into the CB of the solvent. The equilibrium is rapidly reestablished, but

the conductivity increases significantly during the 1064 nm laser pulse. Observe that all

∆κ t( )  kinetics  eventually  approach  zero,  i.e.,  there  is  no  inhibition  of  geminate

recombination due to the photodetrapping. As shown by Lukin et al, 50 such a process is

significant  only  for  t

weighted by their equilibrium fractions. As seen from eq. (7), this ratio does not depend

on the delay time of the 1064 nm pulse (in accordance with Fig. 3), and is independent of

electron mobilities and yields as well. Eq. (7) is valid  only for low fluence  J  of the 1064

nm  light,  i.  e.,  when  the  deviation  from  the  equilibrium  is  relatively  small.  At  high

fluence, the equilibrium is shifted during the pulse, and a phenomenon akin to saturation

sets in (see the Appendix for more discussion). The typical plots of  r  vs.  J  are shown in

Fig.  11S(a).  In  Fig.  11S(b),  the  ratio  r   is  normalized  by  its  value  rmax   attained  at  the

maximum fluence  Jmax of 1064 nm photons (ca. 8.5x1018 photons/cm2). As seen from the

latter  plot,  the  ratio  r   first  increases  linearly  with  increasing  fluence  (for  J <1018
]  and  then  "saturates"  (Fig.

photons/cm2)  with  a  slope  that  weakly  depends  on  MeCN

[

11S).  In  Fig  4(b),  the  ratios  r   are  plotted  for  J ≈5.4x1017  photon/cm2  (squares)  and

8.1x1018  photon/cm2  (circles)  as  functions  of  K   ( ≈ K ceq ).  The  higher  fluence

corresponds  to  the  "saturation"  regime  whereas  the  lower  fluence  corresponds  to  the

linear regime, eq. (7). The two curves exhibit the same initial slope but diverge at higher

concentrations, as the equilibrium shifts towards  e MeCN

the detrapping rate. The latter activation energy is commonly identified with the binding

energy  Et  of the trapped electron with respect to the CB edge. 6,7,16 For n-hexane and iso-

octane,  estimates  of  39±2  and  39±1  kJ/mol  were  obtained,  respectively.  These  two

estimates agree perfectly with the estimate of  Et

≈400 meV given above. The closeness

of binding energies for the two alkanes qualitatively accounts for the similarity of the TA

spectra shown in Fig. 2.

4.2.2. Alcohols in n-hexane.

Fig. 12S shows a family of  κ t( ) kinetics for 248 nm photoexcitation of 12 mM

ethanol  in  n-hexane  solutions  for  several  temperatures  between  2  and  42  oC.  As  is

observed  for  acetonitrile,  these  kinetics  decay  exponentially  (except  for  the  lowest

temperatures; see below), otherwise the two systems show quite different behavior.

First, in alcohol solutions the conductivity signal  κ

i   from  the  ions  depends  on

[

EtOH

] (Fig. 13S). The concentration dependence of κ

i  is the same in solutions with and

without anthracene. Other photosensitizers, such as benzene and triethylamine, exhibit

22.

the same  κ

i  dependence. Moreover, the same κ

[
i  vs.  EtOH

] plots are observed in SF6-

and  CO2-saturated  solutions,  where  the  electrons  are  promptly  converted  to  anions.

Almost the same dependencies are observed at lower temperatures (Fig. 13S). Time of

flight  experiments  (Fig.  14S(a)  shows  a  few  typical  traces)  indicate  that  addition  of

ethanol decreases the mobility of fluoride anions in SF6-saturated hexane solution (with

0.65 mM triethylamine added as a photosensitizer). For the cation, no such decrease was

observed. The decrease in the anion mobility (ca. 2 times for 0.12 M ethanol, Fig. 14S(b))

is very substantial, and it readily accounts for the observed decrease in  κ

i   (Fig.  13S),

suggesting that the ionization yield does not depend on the alcohol concentration, as is

also the case for acetonitrile. 51

Second, for alcohols the electron conductivity κ

0 decreases with increasing  S[ ] in

a  qualitatively  different  way  than  for  acetonitrile,  as  it  does  not  follow  eq.  (6).  This

dependence does not change upon the deuteration: it is exactly the same for CH3OH and
], the same
CD3OD and C2H5OH and C2D5OD (Fig. 6(a)). By appropriately scaling  ROH[
0  vs.  ROH[
κ

]  dependence  was  observed  for  methanol,  ethanol,  and  1-propanol  (Fig.

6(a)). Since all these dependencies are the same, in the following only ethanol solutions

are  considered;  this  solute  is  representative  of  other  normal  alcohols.  Baxendale  and

Sharpe  21 reported that qualitatively different behaviors were observed for different n-

alcohols.  Our  results  suggest  otherwise.  The  likely  problem  with  the  previous

measurement was inadequate control of alcohol concentration (section 3).

For ethanol solution, κ

0 does not decrease until  χ>0.01; at higher concentration,

µ  decreases rapidly, and for  χ ≈ 0.1 almost no  eqf

−  remain in the solution due to the

occurrence of reaction (2). The decay rate of κ t( ) decreases as  µ  decreases, however,

unlike in acetonitrile solutions, addition of a 1-5 mM of alcohol actually increases  the

rate constant  k

+ ∆  of the exponential decay ( kn  is the constant observed in neat n-

hexane) with little change in the apparent electron mobility (Fig. 15S). This behavior (for

1-propanol)  is  in  agreement  with  the  pulse  radiolysis  -  TA  study  by  Baxendale  and

Rasburn.  23 Gangwer et al.  25 reported that the bimolecular rate constant  k

electron scavenging by methanol in iso-octane decreases from 4x108 M-1 s-1  (the  same

limiting rate constant was obtained by Baxendale and Rasburn) 23 at 0.1 mM to 108 M-1 s-1

at 5 mM. Their time-of-flight measurement suggested (in agreement with our results) that

µ  did not change significantly at these low concentrations. 52  As shown in Figs. 16S(a)

and 16S(b), in the course of the scavenging reaction occurring in this low-concentration

regime (at 2 oC and 21.5 oC, respectively), the ratio r does not change with the delay time

tL . This argues against the occurrence of slow reaction (3) in these very dilute solutions

(the  trapping  would  increase  the  retention  time  of  the  electron  in  the  trap,  thereby

increasing ratio  r  at longer delay times  tL ). In principle, the initial increase in the decay

rate  k  may be explained by a scavenging reaction involving electron-attaching impurity

present  in  the  solute,  such  as  an  aldehyde.  25  Our  control  experiments  as  well  as  gas

chromatography  suggest  that  the  aldehyde  concentration  is  too  low  to  account  for  the

effect  observed.  A  crucial  observation  is  that  the  initial  bimolecular  rate  k

≈ ∆

k c

eff

decreases by ca. 20% when deuterated alcohols are used instead of protiated ones, both

for ethanol and methanol (Figs. 15S(a) and 15(b), respectively). Only a proton transfer

would  exhibit  such  a  considerable  isotope  effect  (observe  that  no  isotope  effect  was

observed for electron mobility, Fig. 6(a)). All these observations point to a slow (< 5x109

M -1 s-1  vs.  a  typical  electron  attachment  constant  of  (1-3)x1012 M-1 s-1),  19,25 inefficient

and Rasburn; 23 our results further support their suggestion.

At  higher  alcohol  concentrations  ( χ>0.01),  the  electron  mobility  rapidly

decreases  with  the  net  solute  concentration  c  of  the  alcohol  (Figs.  6(a)  and  6(b)).

Following Baxendale and Sharpe, 21 the decrease in  µ  can be described by an empirical

formula

data in Fig. 6(b) can be fit using this equation assuming temperature-independent  m ≈3.5

( c0  is ca. 18±1 mM at 23  oC). Thus, in agreement with Gangwer et al.  25 we conclude,

contrary to Baxendale and co-workers, 20-24 that only higher multimers trap the electron in

alcohol  solutions  at  equilibrium.  To  make  more  quantitative  estimates,  the  following

model was used: 25 The alcohol molecules were assumed to cluster according to reactions

(4) with the equilibrium constants  Kn given in section 2.2, and solvated electrons  esolv

Two models were examined in which the electron is attached (exclusively) to (i) a trimer

or (ii) a tetramer. As seen from Fig. 7(a) both of these models fit the data well, except for

the  room-temperature  data,  which  are  better  accounted  for  by  the  tetramer  attachment

(this  figure  also  shows  an  equilibrium  fraction  f

methanol at 23  oC, the tetramer also provides the best fit to the data (not shown). The

latter result is in agreement with Gangwer et al. 25 who suggested tetramer or pentamer as

the predominant electron trapping  ROH n

(

)  cluster for solutions of methanol in iso-octane

and  tetramethylsilane.  Van't  Hoff  plots  for  the  equilibrium  constants  of  reaction  (3)

obtained using these two models are shown in Fig. 7(b). From these plots the enthalpy of

reaction (3) for  n = 3 and 4 would be -58±2 and -64.5±2.5 kJ/mol, respectively. Thus, the

(

ROH n

)  trap binds the electron ca. 0.6 eV deeper than the intrinsic solvent trap, and the

binding energy  Et  is ca. 800 meV. Similar estimates were obtained using the approach

described in section 4.2.1, by comparison of the activation energies for  κ

0 at different

ethanol concentrations (Fig. 8(a)). As [EtOH] increases from 0 to 6 to 12 to 25 to 45 mM,

these activation energies increase from 32.5±0.5 to 36±0.5 to 45±1.4 to 76±4 to 90±2

26.

kJ/mol. The difference between the first and the last of these energies is ca. -57±3 kJ/mol

which is in a reasonable agreement with the heat of reaction (3) obtained using van't Hoff

analysis.  For  methanol  tetramer  in  iso-octane,  Gangwer  et  al.  estimated  this  heat  as  -

63±14  kJ/mol.  25 At 23  oC,  Keq  for  ethanol  tetramer  is  ca.  65  times  greater  than  for

acetonitrile monomer (Fig. 7(b)).

We turn to electron  detachment experiments in which a 1064 nm laser pulse was

 cluster to the CB and observe the

subsequent relaxation of the conductivity signal  ∆κ. The time profile of the  ∆κ kinetics

does not depend on the delay time  tL  of the 1064 nm pulse and the maximum amplitude
), as is the case for acetonitrile (two examples are given in

of the  ∆κ signal follows κ

Lt(

Fig. 16S). In other respects, the  ∆κ kinetics are very different from those observed in
acetonitrile/n-hexane solutions. The most remarkable feature is that the  ∆κ t( ) kinetics do

not follow the time profile of the 1064 nm excitation pulse (Figs. 9, 10, 17S, and 18S).

Even  at  room  temperature  (e.g.,  Fig.  17S),  there  is  a  "slow"  component  with  a  time

constant  τ

s  of a few nanoseconds. To analyze these data, the  ∆κ kinetics were fit by a

)

Such  an  approach  can  be  justified  for  J → 0   using  the  two-trap  model  (see  the

Appendix). At high EtOH concentration, the "slow" component decays too fast and/or

has too low weight to be analyzed in this fashion. At lower temperature (Figs. 9 and 10),

the "slow" component (with a relative weight approaching 10-50% of the total signal)

entirely separates from the initial "spike". For  EtOH

[

] <10 mM,  τ

s  increases over 20 ns

(e.g., Fig. 9). With increase in  EtOH

[

] (Figs. 9 and 18S) or in the temperature (Figs. 10

27.

and  17S(b)),  τ

s   decreases  until  the  "slow"  component  is  no  longer  discernible.  The

observation  of  the    "slow"  component  indicates  that  the  equilibration  of  the  electron

between different traps occurs on a time scale that is longer than the duration of the 1064

nm pulse ( τ

p

≈ 4 ns). At 1.7  oC, this slow equilibration can already be seen in the  κ t( )

kinetics (Figs. 12S and 17S(a)) which become biexponential (the κ

0 values given in Fig.

6 were extrapolated to  t → 0  using the slower component, as shown in Fig. 12S).

There  are  two  general  ways  to  interpret  these  observations.  First,  it  can  be

assumed that the slow component corresponds to settling of equilibrium reaction (3) that

involves  a  (unique)  electron-trapping  cluster  Sn  (e.g.,  the  trimer).  As  shown  in  the

Appendix, in such a case the time constant  τ

the power dependence of ratio  r  vs.  J  would be almost linear, whereas experimentally it

"saturates" around  J ≈1018 photon/cm2 (Fig. 19S). Furthermore, as shown in section 4.1,

−{
the  absorptivity    of  e

Sn solv

  is  certainly  greater  than  that  of  esolv

  and  it  may  be

expected that the detachment cross section would also be larger (unless there is a side

photoreaction, such as proton transfer). Lastly, it seems counterintuitive that τ

2 increases

28.

by no more than an order of the magnitude as the binding energy increases from ca. 400

meV (for acetonitrile) to ca. 800 meV (for alcohol multimer). As pointed out in section

4.1,  the  simple  two-trap  model  cannot  account  completely  for  the  observed  spectral

transformations for electrons in alcohol solutions as a function of solute concentration.

The analysis of concentration plots for  µ  given above also suggests that more than one

kind of electron-attaching solute trap exists in the solution. The "slow" component is due

to  the  equilibration  between  these  solute  traps.  Such  an  equilibration  may  occur  via

−{
coupled reactions (3) even if the conversion between  e

:

}
Sn solv

 species via reaction (5)

does not occur, however, as shown below, the experimental observations can be readily

rationalized  assuming  that  this  "dipole  coagulation"  reaction  does  occur  and  τ

s   is  the

measure of the corresponding reaction rate. We stress that the treatment is qualitative by

necessity  since  all  pertinent  parameters  for  the  several  interrelated  equilibria  involved

(reactions (3), (4), and (5)) cannot be extracted from the data unambiguously.

Using our estimates for τ

s , the effective bimolecular constant  k

eff

= (

)−τ 1 can be

c

s

calculated (Figs. 11(a) and 11(b)). Due to the solute speciation via reaction (4), such a

"constant" does not relate to any particular reaction (5). Still, for all temperatures between

2  and  23  oC  the  rate  constants  keff   for  c > 30  mM  converge  to  (3-5)x109  M-1 s-1  (Fig.

11(a)). The activation energy for the solvent viscosity is low (ca. 6.3±0.4 kJ/mol) so that

diffusion controlled reactions in n-hexane are weakly activated. The typical rate of such

reactions  is  ca.  (1-5)x1010  M-1 s-1,  i.e.,  the  apparent  rate  of  reaction  that  may  be

responsible for the slow component is a fraction of what one would expect for reaction

{
(5) involving a (normally diffusing)  e

−

:

(

)

}

 cluster and a free  ROH  molecule

or  a  small  ROH m

(

)   cluster.  Given  that  in  this  concentration  range,  the  fraction  of  the

monomers  is  only  20-50%  of  the  nominal  concentration  c  (Fig.  1S),  the  observed

equilibration would be consistent with the occurrence of reaction (5) in the solution. As

29.

[EtOH] decreases below 20 mM,  keff  rapidly increases, reaching 4x1010 M-1 s-1 (for 5 mM

ethanol at 15 oC). This increase becomes larger with  increasing temperature (Fig. 11(a)).

−{
Note that reaction (5) can occur at a higher rate if the  e

:

}
Sn solv

 species on the left side

exhibits high (apparent) mobility.

The Arrhenius plots for  keff  at fixed  c exhibit a large decrease of the activation

energy with increasing c  (Fig. 11(b)). As [EtOH] increases from 6 to 12 to 25 to 45 mM,

the activation energy decreases from 50±10 to 42±3 to 34±4 to 15±1 kJ/mol. The low

activation energy obtained at the higher end of this concentration range can be explained

by low mobility of the partners in reaction (5): as the reaction rate becomes controlled by

(normal)  diffusion,  the  activation  energy  approaches  the  activation  energy  for  solvent

viscosity. The dramatic increase in the reaction rate in very dilute solutions suggests that

{
a  mobile  e

−

:

(

)

}

 species is involved. Thus, a large reaction barrier exists for

{
reaction  (5)  involving  the  smallest  e

−

:

(

)
ROH n solv

}

 species (apparently, monomers or

dimers)  that  has  large  apparent  mobility.  While  the  evidence  for  occurrence  of  direct

reaction (5) is not clear-cut, our results clearly suggest that in very dilute solutions the

electron  equilibria  are  multistage  and  take  considerable  time  to  settle  at  the  low

temperature.  This  relatively  slow  settling  is  chiefly  responsible  for  anomalies  in  the

reaction rates first noticed by Gangwer et al. 25

In Appendix A of ref. 6 we showed that eq. (7) would hold regardless of whether

reactions (5) occur, provided that the residence time  τ

t  in a given trap is appropriately

defined. On the strength of this result, one may inquire how this parameter (and the ratio

r)  change  as  a  function  of  temperature  and  concentration.  As  shown  in  Fig.  6(b),  for

χ>0.01,  r

cm∝   with  m ≈2.8-2.9,  at  all  temperatures.  Note  that  as  a  function  of  K

(plotted in Fig. 20S(b)), the ratio r in ethanol solutions behaves in a very similar fashion

30.

as this ratio in acetonitrile solutions (Fig. 4(b)). For  χ ≈ 0.14 ethanol solution, r increases

by three orders of the magnitude relative to neat n-hexane. This huge increase swamps

the  (relatively  small)  effect  of  the  change  in  the    absorption  (photodetachment)  cross

section with the ethanol concentration (section 4.1), i.e., most of the increase is due to the

increase in the residence time τ

t . As the exponential parameter m is close to 3, the trimer

{
is likely to be the prevalent  e

−

:

(

)

}

 species in the solution that is photoexcited

by  1064  nm  light.  The  activation  energy  for  r   does  not  depend  on  the  ethanol

concentration for  c > 20 mM (Fig. 7(b)). From the Arrhenius plots, the activation energy

is ca. 74±5 kJ/mol (770±50 meV). This energy is reasonably close to the binding energy

Et   of  ca.  800  meV  for  the  trimer  (or,  possibly,  the  tetramer)  estimated  from  the  van't

Hoff plot in Fig. 8(b).

4.3. Irreversible trapping.

The  conductivity  measurements  presented  in  section  4.2  are  not  sensitive  to

electrons  that  are  irreversibly  trapped  by  higher  multimers  (for  which  the  thermal

detrapping  time  is  longer  than  electron  lifetime).  Still,  the  electron  could  be

photodetached even from such a species provided that the latter absorbs laser light. 6 An

additional  ∆κ signal with the amplitude increasing with the delay time  tL   6  would  be

expected from such a photoexcitation. The time profile of the resulting  ∆κ signal would

be  identical  with  that  of  κ t( ),  save  for  the  delay  time  of  the  1064  nm  pulse.  6,10

Surprisingly, no such additional signal was observed in either photosystem. Since these

−{
stable  e

:

}
Sn solv

 species should absorb in the near infrared (as suggested by TA spectra

in section 4.1) we are forced to conclude that the electron cannot be detached from large

ethanol  clusters  by  1064  nm  photons.  As  the  TA  signals  observed  in  pulse  radiolysis

experiments  decay  in  1  µs,  it  is  possible  that  electrons  in  such  clusters  are  unstable,

31.

decaying by proton transfer to  RO−  anions, as happens for  esolv

−

 in neat alcohols. 53,55 This

slow  reaction,  however  does  not  explain  the  lack  of  ∆κ  signal  from  such  a  stable
−{
e

  species  at  shorter  delay  times  (50-200  ns).  Thus,  we  are  left  with  the

:

}
Sn solv

conclusion that the quantum yield for photodetachment from such clusters must be very

low,  either  due  to  the  predominance  of  bound-to-bound  ( s

p→ )  transitions  and/or  to

rapid proton transfer in the excited state (as occurs in neat alcohols). 55

For  acetonitrile  in  n-hexane,  a  similar  problem  exists  since  no  conclusive

evidence  for  IR-absorbing  e MeCN n solv

]

  multimer  species  was  found  in  our

}

photodetachment  experiments,  though  there  is  some  evidence  for  such  a  species  (or  a

molecular  anion)  in  concentrated  solutions  in  iso-octane  (section  4.2.1).  The  possible

explanation  for  inefficient  "dipole  coagulation"  is  that  the  reaction  of  e MeCN

:

−{

with  acetonitrile  yields  the  dimer  anion,  MeCN

(

2 .  10  This  covalently-bound  anion

absorbs  poorly  in  the  infrared,  as  its  absorption  band  is  centered  in  the  visible.  10,11,14

Upon excitation in the vis and infrared, it photodissociates to  CH

although  for  1064  nm  photoexcitation  the  quantum  yield  is  very  low  (<0.01).  10  The

increase in the TA signal in the visible at longer delay time observed in pulse radiolysis

experiments  (Figs.  4S  and  6S)  can  be  accounted  for  by  the  slow  generation  of  dimer

anion via reaction (5), although a persistent cation (sections 2.2 and 4.1) can also explain

these observations. The photodetachment experiments using 532 nm light 10 indicate that

shorter-wave  photoexcitation  does  induce  the  expected  long-lived  ∆κ  signal  with  a

pattern typical of a molecular anion or a stable  e MeCN n solv

: [

]

 species (see Figs. 7S

−{

}

and 8S in the Supplement of ref. 10). The results for iso-octane  suggest  that  electron

trapping by such a species may in fact be reversible; however, reaction (5) is strongly

shifted towards the anion in the concentration range where eq. (6) does not hold.

32.

5. Discussion.

5.1. Synopsis.

The following picture emerges from our results. In dilute solutions of acetonitrile

in n-hexane and iso-octane ( χ<0.01), a new electron species,  e MeCN

:

, is formed.

−{

}

solv

The binding energy of this species is ca. 0.4 eV (relative to the mobility edge of the CB)

which is ca. 0.2 eV greater than the binding energy for the intrinsic electron trap in neat

n-hexane. The trapping reduces the rate of thermally-activated emission to the CB by ca.

200  times.  In  the  specified  concentration  range,  the  solute  trap  involves  a  single

acetonitrile  molecule.  For  iso-octane,  there  is  some  evidence  for  nearly-irreversible

electron attachment to larger solute clusters and/or delayed formation of molecular anions

at higher solute concentration. For  λ< 1.6 µm, the absorption spectra of trapped electrons

in acetonitrile solutions are qualitatively similar to those in neat n-hexane, save for less

prominent  extension  towards  the  visible.  As  explained  in  ref.  10,  the  formation  of  a

molecular anion,  MeCN − , with a bent C-C-N chain is unlikely, given the low entropy of

trapping and unfavorable energetics; furthermore, both theoretical calculations  10,11 and

experimental  observations  56 indicate  that  such  an  anion  would  not  exhibit  electron

transitions in the infrared. Thus, the electron in the "acetonitrile trap" still resides in the

interstitial cavity. The electron is dipole-bound to the CN group of acetonitrile molecule

in the first solvation shell; 10,13 this interaction is mainly electrostatic.

It is commonly assumed 6,7,16 that the rate of thermal emission from electron traps

is given by

 is the thermal energy (ca. 25.4 meV at 23 oC). Simpleminded use of this

formula indicates that the thermal emission from  e MeCN

}

:

solv

slower  than  that  from  esolv

−

,  whereas  experimentally  it  is  only  200  times  slower.

Furthermore, for both of these electron traps, the frequency  ν

t  (7x1015 and 3x1014 Hz,

respectively) is unrealistically large. We conclude that eq. (12) overestimates the stability

of electron traps in mixed solvents: something other than energetics controls this stability.

The  most  likely  cause  is  the  loss  of  a  solute  molecule  via  backward  reaction  (5):  the

entropy factor prevents substitution in the solvation shell of the cavity electron. As shown

by  the  previous  workers  2 0 - 2 6  and  confirmed  in  this  study  (section  4.2.2),  the
−{
e ROH

 species, for which the interaction with the electron is relatively weak, is

}

:

solv

thermodynamically unstable, while the binding energy for this species can only be higher

than that for  esolv

−

. Apparently, the entropy term prevails for this species: it either loses the

ROH  molecule or undergoes proton transfer.

For  larger  alcohol  clusters, the  situation  is  different  because  the  electron  can

interact with several OH groups and the binding energies are large. The same behavior

was observed for methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol. Our data point to alcohol trimer or

tetramer as the predominant form of the cluster that reversibly traps electron via reactions

(2,3) for  χ<0.015, with a binding energy of 770 or 800 meV (section 4.2.2). Despite this

large binding energy, the driving force of reaction (3) for these multimers is only 0.1 eV

more  negative  than  that  for  acetonitrile  monomer  with  Et

≈400  meV.  Surprisingly,

photodetachment  experiments  using  infrared  light  give  no  evidence  for  a  larger

Instability of the ground and/or excited state of these species towards proton transfer is a

34.

possible explanation for this unexpected observation. The size of the dominant electron

trapping solute cluster appears to be tightly constrained, both from below and above, over

a  wide  concentration  range.  Previous  studies  seem  to  support  this  conclusion.  E.g.,

Smirnov et al.  26 studied ODMR spectra from dilute ethanol/squalane solutions at 23 oC

and  observed  no  change  in  the  shape  of  the  resonance  line  of  solvated  electrons  as

[EtOH]  increased  from  10  to  100  mM.  As  seen  from  Fig.  2(a)  in  section  4.1    the  TA

spectra  of  electrons  in  ethanol/n-hexane  solutions  can  be  understood,  to  a  first

approximation,  in  terms  of  just  two  species  contributing  to  the  spectrum.  All  of  these

observations point to a relative uniformity of trapped-electron species, at thermodynamic

equilibrium in dilute alcohol solutions. The "dipole coagulation" and electron attachment

{
do not yield metastable  e

−

:

 species beyond a certain size.

Another intriguing observation is the possible occurrence of reaction (5) which

could account for the slow settling of electron equilibria on the nanosecond time scale in

very dilute solutions ( χ<5x10-3) at low temperature. Previous researchers believed that

electron equilibria are settled very rapidly, and this is indeed the case for concentrated,

room temperature alcohol solutions. E.g., Kenney-Wallace and Jonah  19 concluded that

for  χ>0.03-0.05  (which  is  well  above  the  concentration  range  where  "dipole

coagulation" on the nanosecond time scale occurs), all equilibria (3) are settled within 30

ps.  Gangwer  et  al.  25  estimated  that  methanol  multimers  ( n ≥ 4) in iso-octane  attach

electron  with  a  rate  constant  >  1012  M-1 s-1.  However,  neither  group  considered  the

possibility that the trap, once filled, can incorporate more solvent molecules or exchange

the  electron  with  a  larger  cluster.  Our  results  suggest  that  such  reactions  ("dipole

coagulation")  18  do  occur  in  very  dilute  solutions.  Apparently,  reaction  (5)  involves  a

monomer  or  a  dimer.  The  reaction  is  slow  and  thermally  activated,  suggesting  a

35.

continuum"  models  for  electron  solvation  2c,57  to  model  its  structure.  In  this  class  of

models a few fixed dipoles are treated explicitly in the interaction Hamiltonian; the rest

of the solvent, beyond some cutoff radius, is treated as a continuum with bulk dielectric

properties. Gangwer et al. 25 used such an approach to estimate the energetics of electron

trapping  by  methanol  multimers  in  iso-octane.  Unfortunately,  this  model  makes  no

provision  for  the  involvement  of solvent    molecules,  whereas  such  an  involvement  is

certainly important.

Since a self-consistent theory of solvated electron in alkanes is presently lacking, 6

 is the localization radius. 58a,59 In neat alkanes, this radius is 4-5 Å,

i.e.,  the  extension  of  the  electron  density  onto  the  solvent  is  very  significant.  In  this

respect,  esolv

−

 in alkanes is different from the electron in polar solvents, where the binding

energy is large, the electron wavefunction is confined inside the cavity, and bound-to-

bound  s

p→  transitions dominate in the visible and in the infrared. 2,4,54 In polar solvents,

the cavity radius  a rapidly increases with increasing temperature. 31,32 For alkanes, this

radius is nearly constant; 6,7a,58  Epol also depends weakly on the temperature. However, U

(and, consequently,  Et ) decreases rapidly with increasing temperature since the energy

V0  of  eqf

−  increases greatly with solvent density. 6,7a The latter changes substantially as a

function  of  temperature  for  alkane  solvents.  In  ref.  6  the  absorption  spectra  of  esolv

  in

−

liquid n-hexane were fit using the spherical well model and binding energies  Et   were

estimated  at  several  temperatures;  these  estimates  are  in  good  agreement  with  the

activation energies of thermal emission obtained from d.c. conductivity experiments. For

neat n-hexane at 23 oC,  Et

≈200 meV,  U ≈1.39 eV and the absorption maximum for the

bound-to-continuum transition is at  λ≈ 2.95 µm (Fig. 12(b), trace (i)). 6,45

37.

The same spherical well model can be used to estimate the binding energies for

  species.  To  this  end,  we  assumed  that  the  "mean"  well  depth  U  increases

:

stepwise relative to the same quantity  Un  for the intrinsic solvent trap by the energy  Vdip

of interaction with a polar molecule. The latter energy is estimated using the point dipole

approximation. All solute molecules are equivalent, so that  U U

=

+

n

dip

. We further

assumed  that  the  cavity  size  does  not  change  upon  the  inclusion  of  these  solute

molecules.

Let us consider first the acetonitrile monomer. As suggested in section 5.1, the

cavity electron is solvated by the methyl group with the CN group pointing away from

the cavity center. Assuming that the methyl protons are at the hard core radius  r

a≈ , the

center of the CN bond is ca. 6 Å away from the cavity center. The interaction energy  Vdip

for the 3.92 D dipole in the cyano group is ca. 330 meV, which gives  U ≈1.72 eV and

Et

≈390  meV.  This  binding  energy  compares  favorably  with  the  400  meV  obtained

experimentally  (section  4.2.1).  Fig.  12(b),  trace  (v)  shows  the  simulation  of  the

absorption spectrum for the 390 meV trap. The absorption maximum is at  λ≈ 1.68 µm

which is just beyond the observation range of our pulse radiolysis - TA setup ( λ< 1.6

µm, section 4.1). The absorptivity at  λ= 1 µm is ca. 2 times that for the  Et

≈200 meV

trap, in reasonable agreement with experiment. For  λ< 1.6 mm, the spectral profiles for

200 and 400 nm traps are similar, with the shallower trap exhibiting less sloping towards

the blue. This is also in agreement with experiment (Fig. 1(a)).

For alcohol clusters, the same method can be used to solve the inverse problem:

estimating the mean distances to OH dipoles from the energetics. The binding energy  Et

for the prevalent ethanol multimer is ca. 770 meV (from the activation energy of electron

photodetachment in Fig. 8(b)) or 800 meV (from van't Hoff plots in Fig. 7). Using the

38.

plot in Fig. 12(a) we find that  U  of 2.27 or 2.31 eV would correspond to these binding

energies, so that  V

≈ 880

dip

n

 meV, where  n  is the mean number of solute molecules

in the solvation shell of the cavity electron. Placing the center of a radially aligned OH

dipole (ca. 1.7 D) at a distance  rOH  from the cavity center, we find  rOH

≈4.2 Å for  n =3

and  rOH

≈4.8 Å for  n =4. Since the O-H bond length is ca. 1 Å, the trimer gives a better

match, with the OH dipoles at an angle to the radial direction. Such an arrangement is in

accord with quantum mechanical - molecular dynamics models of the solvated electron in

neat water and alcohols.  4,54 The monomer and the dimer are predicted to have binding

energies of 365 and 555 meV, respectively, with their absorption bands centered at 1.78

and 1.39 µm, respectively (Fig. 12(b), traces (ii) to (iv)). The trimer ( Et

≈770 meV) is

calculated to have maximum absorbance at  λ≈ 1.18 µm; the molar absorptivity at  λ= 1

µm is ca. 6.2 times greater than that for  esolv

−

 ( Et

≈200 meV; see Fig. 12(c)). This estimate

is in agreement with the factor of ca. 5 times obtained experimentally (section 4.1). At the

higher end of the concentration range explored (ca. 120 mM), at which the conductivity

signal  is  dominated  by  a  single  reversibly  trapped  species,  the  TA  spectrum  peaks  at

0.95-1 µm (Fig. 2(a)). This position is in a reasonable agreement with the estimate given

above.  While  our  approach  is  obviously  crude,  it  yields  reasonable  estimates  for  the

energetics observed. Improving this model is hindered by the lack of microscopic insight

in the nature of solvent  traps in liquid alkanes.

6. Conclusion.

Electron  localization  in  dilute  ( χ<0.015)  solutions  of  polar  molecules  in

nonpolar  liquids  has  been  studied  using  TA  spectroscopy  and  conductivity.  In  the

conductivity experiments, 1.17 eV photon excitation was used to detach the electron from

−{
a  e

:

}
Sn solv

 species and observe relaxation dynamics on the nanosecond time scale. In

39.

acetonitrile  solutions,  the  electron  can  attach  to  a  single  solute  molecule  forming  the
−{
e MeCN

  species.  The  dynamics  of  this  attachment  can  be  understood  using  a

}

:

solv

simple two-trap model. The binding energy for this  e MeCN

:

  species  is  ca.  400

−{

}

solv

meV and its lifetime (limited by thermal emission to the conduction band) is ca. 1 ns at

23  oC. The properties of this electron species can be rationalized assuming that  MeCN

substitutes for the solvent molecules in the first solvation shell of  esolv

. The methyl group

−

of  MeCN  is at the cavity wall, while the C-N group is ca. 6 Å away from the center of

the solvation cavity and points outwards. The resulting structure is midway between the

solvated electron in neat alkanes 6,7,16,17,58 and in liquid acetonitrile. 10-14 Further inclusion

of acetonitrile molecules does not occur, most likely due to the formation of a covalently

bound dimer anion with lower energy.  10,11,14,56  Interestingly, thermal emission from the

acetonitrile monomer trap (as well as from the related ethanol monomer trap) appears to

be much faster than expected from the energetics alone (section 5.1). Apparently, entropy

plays as much a role as the binding energy in determining the stability of these solute

traps. E.g., while the binding energy for the  e ROH

:

 species is ca. 165 meV greater

−{

}

n

than  this  energy  for  esolv

−

  (section  5.2),  the  electron  equilibrium  is  completely  shifted

towards the shallower trap. The driving force of electron attachment to ethanol tetramer

is only 0.1 eV more negative than that for acetonitrile monomer.

Electron  trapping  in  dilute  alcohol  solutions  is  more  involved,  as  "dipole

coagulation"  (reaction  (5))  occurs  concurrently  with  several  electron  and  H-bonding

equilibria (reactions (3) and (4), respectively). The resulting dynamics are rather complex

and we were unable to disentangle all reactions involved. Still, several conclusions can be

reached:  The  electron  does  not  attach  to  the  alcohol  monomer.  This  is  due  both  to

unfavorable  thermodynamics  (as  the  resulting  species  is  unstable  towards  the  reverse

reaction  (3))  and  to  the  occurrence  of  proton  transfer  reaction  (8).  The  latter  reaction

40.

−{
probably  occurs  for  other  e

  species.  Its  rapid  occurrence  (either  in  the
−{
ground or in the excited states) for higher  e

 multimers which attach the

)

: (

: (

}

electron irreversibly might account for the lack of IR-light induced electron detachment

from these species. The lower multimers ( n <5) attach the electron reversibly. Following

the initial attachment reaction (3), "dipole coagulation" reaction (5) is observed on the

−{
nanosecond  time  scale.  When  equilibrium  is  reached,  the  prevalent  e

: (

ROH n solv
)

}

species ( n ≈ 3-4) binds the electron by ca. 800 meV. These energetics and the TA spectra

observed  are  consistent  with  the  OH  groups  of  solute  molecules  lining  the  solvation

cavity.

This  study  was  conceived  as  a  search  for  condensed-matter  analogs  of  dipole-

bound  62 and cluster 2b,12,13,63,64 anions occurring in the gas phase. In recent years, cluster

anions of polar molecules, such as  H O

, have been extensively studied (see refs 2b,

(

)−

n

2

63, and 64 and references therein). Such clusters are interesting in their own right, but

also as model systems for electron solvation in the bulk liquid. Since surface trapping

prevails  in  small  and  even  medium-size  clusters  ( n <20),  2b,64  the  direct  comparison

between these cluster anions and  esolv

−

 in liquids is difficult, although possible. 64 On the

other  hand,  electron  trapping  in  large  clusters  ( n >25-50)  where  internal  localization

−{
prevails is as difficult to model as that in neat liquids. The  e

:

}
Sn solv

 species occurring

in alkanes provide what these small gas-phase  Sn

−  clusters do not: a model system for  esolv

−

in a neat polar liquid -- with few polar molecules directly involved. This, in turn, suggests

that a species whose anion core closely resembles the first solvation shell of  esolv

  in  a

−

polar liquid may be achieved in the gas phase by making a composite cluster anion in

which several polar molecules are embedded in a large number of nonpolar molecules.

Perhaps, "solvents" for which  V0  (the energy of quasifree electron relative to the vacuum)

41.

is small and electron trapping is facile (e.g., n-alkanes other than methane) would be most

−{
suitable.  The  resulting  e

:

}
Sn solv

  species  has  the  same  structure  and  energetics

regardless of the alkane "solvent" (section 4).

Our  study  also  hints  at  the  possibility  of  a  fixed-geometry  molecular  cage

"solvating"  the  electron  in  an  alkane  solution.  Such  a  cage  (in  analogy  with  alcohol

multimers in n-hexane) would include several radial groups assembled around the central

cavity. Crown ethers, cryptands, and cyclosiloxanes provide a structural motif conducive

to electron trapping in this fashion. There are precedents for fixed-geometry  esolv

 species

−

in low-temperature crystalline solids: single crystals of sugars 65 and hexagonal ice 66 are

known  to  trap  electrons  due  to  the  fortuitous  orientation  of  OH  groups  at  certain

interstitial  sites.  Another  example  is  electrides  (e.g.,  Cs+ [18-crown-6] • −e )  6 7  that

(presumably) trap electrons in cavities and channels. Arguably, electrons "solvated" by

well-defined  cages  would  constitute  an  ideal  condensed-phase  model  for  solvated

electrons in polar liquids since their fixed geometry would make ab initio modeling much

easier and their properties would be less dependent on solvent fluctuations.

alcohols

The conductivity signal depends both on the electron mobility and the electron
concentration; the latter quantity is temperature dependent but is the same with
and  without  the  acetonitrile,  as  seen  from  the  constancy  of  long  time  ion
conductivity as a function of  MeCN

].

In  neat  n-hexane  (see  ref.  6),  this  is  not  the  case  due  to  the  formation  of  an
impurity anion that absorbs 1064 nm light. In acetonitrile and alcohol solutions,
this impurity is not formed, due to the competitive trapping/scavenging.

There were previous reports of a large effect of alcohols on the ion mobility in n-
alkanes,  see  Adamczewski,  I.  Ionization,  Conductivity  and  Breakdown  in
Dielectric Liquids; Taylor & Francis: London; 1965; pp. 205. To our knowledge,
no  explanation  has  been  given  for  these  observations.  Almost  certainly,  this
decrease is due to clustering of alcohol molecules around the anion, which forms
strong H bonds with the solute. This effect is interesting in its own right, however,
it has not been pursued in the present study.

(52) With the Hudson method used by Gangwer et al. (ref. 25), it is the  k µ  ratio that

is actually determined.

Appendix. Two-trap model.

In this Appendix, we consider the model in which two trapped species, electron-1
and electron-2 exist in thermodynamic equilibrium with a quasifree electron, (Schemes 1
and  2  below).  A  generalization  of  this  model  for  more  than  two  trapped  species  is
straightforward.

Thus,  ∆κ t( )  can  be  represented  as  a  weighted  sum  of  the  excitation  profile  J t( )  (the
"spike") and the same profile convoluted with an exponential whose time constant equals
the settling time of equilibrium reaction (A14) (the "slow" component). The analysis of
∆κ t( ) kinetics given in section 4.2.2 is based on this general result. Integrating eq. (A21)

, for low solute
concentrations  S[ ] ( K << 1), the relative weight of the exponential "tail" is low and this
weight increases linearly with  S[ ]; as the concentration further increases and  K >> 1, this
weight  decreases  and  the  decay  becomes  faster.  Eventually  this  decay  becomes  faster
than  τ
p   and  the  relative  weight  also  decreases,  so  the  "slow"  component  cannot  be
discerned. Though these trends were indeed observed experimentally for  ∆κ t( ) kinetics
obtained in dilute ethanol solutions (section 4.2.2), the overall data cannot be accounted
for consistently using the two-trap model. Indeed, for  σ
, the second term in eq.
(A21)  always  prevails  and  the  "prompt"  component  is  not  observed  for  any  K .  This
unsettling conclusion refers not only to the case of infinitely small fluence  J  (which is
the  only  regime  that  can  be  handled  analytically)  but  also  to  arbitrary  J ,  as  may  be
shown  using  numerical  simulations.  While  it  is  possible,  in  principle,  that  for  alcohol
traps  σ
  (due  to  photostimulated  proton  transfer  competing  with  electron
photodetachment), in such a case the ratio  r  would stay almost linear with  J  whereas
experimentally  the  "saturation"  (see  below)  sets  in  for  J >1018  photon/cm2  (section
4.2.2).  Our  simulations  suggest  that  within  the  confines  of  the  two-state  model,  it  is
simply  impossible  to  obtain  both  the  low-concentration  ∆κ t( )  curves  observed
experimentally  (that  exhibit  clearly  separable  "spike"  and  "slow"  components  for
S[ ] → 0)  and  sigmoid  power  dependencies.  Consequently,  any  scheme  intended  to
explain these data, even at the qualitative level, has to postulate more than two electron
species.

For arbitrary laser fluence  J t( ), eq. (A5) must be solved numerically and the ratio
r  determined using eqs. (A4) and (A17). Since all equations are linear, the result does not
depend on  e0. For Scheme 1, the calculation of the ratio  r  as a function of  J  (for known
p  (ca. 4 ns)) requires the knowledge of five parameters: σ
pulse duration τ
1 2, , and the
equilibrium  constant  K   (eq.  (A6)).  Two  of  these  parameters,  σ
≈ 3.2x10-17  cm2  and
τ
≈ 8.3 ps, for electron traps in neat n-hexane are known from ref. 24 and our previous
1
[ ] can be estimated from the  µ
study, 6 respectively. The equilibrium constant  K K Seq
data (section 4.2.1). The product  σ τ
K >> 1 in the low-fluence regime; in this regime (neglecting direct  1
Scheme 2),  στ σ τ≈
the main uncertainty is the cross section σ
1 is not known (although
it can be estimated from the TA experiments within a factor of two). The experimental
plots of  r  vs.  J  can be simulated using this approach with minimal adjustments to the
model parameters. Since no refinement of the model parameters can be made using such
simulations, the main goal of these calculations is to demonstrate that the trends observed
experimentally in Figs. 11S can be rationalized using the two-trap model of Scheme 1;
the exact choice of simulation parameters is not important for such a demonstration.

2↔  reactions in

Fig. 21S(a) shows a family of  r  vs.  J  plots for different values of the equilibrium
constant  K . Since  σ τ
>>
, even for relatively low values of  K  the initial slope of
these plots is close to  σ τ
2 2. For higher fluence, the ratio "saturates". As seen from the
plots, for higher K this saturation is less expressed (see also the normalized plots in Fig.
21S(b)    illustrating  the  decreases  in  the  curvature),  because  the  equilibrium  can  be
continuously shifted within the duration of the pulse. Exactly these patterns are observed
experimentally (Fig. 11S and 20S). Plotted as a function of the equilibrium constant  K
for a given fluence J, the ratio r  rapidly reaches a plateau at lower fluence (as follows
from eq. (A24)) but continues to increase with increasing  K  at greater fluence (Fig. 22S).
Once more, the same behavior was observed in dilute acetonitrile solutions in n-hexane
(Fig. 4).

2↔  reactions are introduced (Scheme 2), the bicomponent kinetics
can  be  readily  obtained  even  for  σ
σ
.  It  may  seem  that  the  inclusion  of  these
1
additional  reactions  violates  the  detailed  equilibrium  principle  which  relates  the
2↔   reaction  with  the  equilibrium  constant  for  reaction
equilibrium  constant  of  the  1
(A14). However, it should be kept in mind that Scheme 1 does not make any provision
for interconversion of electron traps (such as reaction (5) in the text) occurring separately
from reaction (A14). It is precisely the principle of detail equilibrium that allows one to
treat this reaction as an additional equilibrium involving filled traps.

(a)  TA  spectra  from  pulse  radiolysed  Ar-saturated  (open  symbols)  and  CO2-saturated
(trace (i), filled circles) room temperature n-hexane. CO2 is added as electron scavenger.
The integration time windows are given in the plot, for trace (i), the integration window
is 6 to 10 ns (the absorbance spectrum, which is mainly from the solvent olefin cation
does not evolve in the first 500 ns after the electron pulse). This trace was normalized at
500  nm,  where  most  absorbance  is  from  the  cation.  In  Ar-saturated  n-hexane  the
absorbance  is  composite:  both  esolv
  and  the  cation  contribute  to  the  spectrum  at  short
delay times. At later delay times, the relative contribution from the cation increases as the
electron is scavenged by impurity. (b) Decay kinetics of optical absorbance at 0.5 and
1.55 µm in Ar- and CO2-saturated solutions (see the legend in the plot). Only electrons
absorb at the longer wavelength, while at the shorter wavelength, only the cations absorb.
Upon the addition of electron scavenger, the end-of-the pulse yield of cations increases
ca.  2  times.  The  smooth  (black)  line  drawn  through  the  1.55  µm  curve  is  single
exponential fit (illustrating that electrons mainly decay via scavenging by an impurity).

electron contributes to the absorbance.

(a-c)  Time  evolution  of  absorbance  spectra  observed  in  pulse  radiolysis  of  room
temperature Ar-saturated, acetonitrile/iso-octane solutions (the concentrations are given
in (a)). The spectra are normalized at 1.55 µm, where only trapped electron absorbs the
analyzing light. At short delay times, the spectrum is dominated by this trapped electron;
at  later  delay  times  the  signal  from  an  olefin  cation  (or  a  dimer  anion)  can  also  be
observed.

A  plot  illustrating  lack  of  time  evolution  for  absorbance  spectra  observed  in  pulse

Decay  kinetics  of  photoconductivity  for  a  5  µm  solution  of  anthracene  in  n-hexane
containing 12 mM EtOH (the temperatures are indicated in the plot). The signal is mainly
from the electrons generated by 2-photon ionization of anthracene by 248 nm laser light.
The smooth curves are exponential fits. Note that at the lowest temperature of 2 oC the
kinetics becomes exponential only after 100 ns. This delay is due to slow settling of the
electron equilibria (see Figs. 9 and 10) at low temperature, in dilute alcohol solutions.

Ar-saturated solution containing 0.3 mM benzene as a sensitizer (filled squares), and SF6-

(a) Time-of-flight conductivity traces (the electrode spacing is 0.8 mm, the voltage is 5
kV)  from  0.65  mM  triethylamine  in  SF6-saturated  n-hexane  (23  oC)  as  a  function  of
ethanol  concentration  (molar  concentrations  are  indicated  in  the  plot).  SF6  rapidly
scavenges the electron within the duration of the 248 nm pulse yielding a fluoride anion,
F-.  A  100  µm  slit  is  placed  near  the  cathode  so  that  the  conductivity  signal  is  from
migrating F-  anions  (the  conductivity  at  the  flat  region  is  ca.  100  pS/cm).  The  cations
rapidly  migrate  in  the  electric  field  and  discharge  at  the  cathode;  a  fraction  of  these
cations decay via. neutralization in the bulk (this reaction is over in 0.5 ms). The higher
the alcohol concentration, the longer is the time of flight for the anions. (b) The plot of
drift mobility for F- vs. [EtOH]. See also Fig. 13S.

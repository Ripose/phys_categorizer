   It were determinated the apparent activating energy of solubilizing multilamellar liposomes
obtained  from  dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine  (MLV-DPPC)  with  sodium  deoxycholate
(DOCNa) by turbidimetric measurements and the  apparent activating  energy  of  solubilizing
MLV obtained from egg-yolk lecithin (MLV-EYL) with different surfactants (DOCNa, TX-
100, CTMB) by rectangular optic diffusimetric measurements. The apparent activating energy
of solubilizing MLV-DPPC with DOCNa is Ea = 127.7kJ/mol. The apparent activating energy
of  solubilizing  MLV-EYL  with  CTMB  is  22.3kJ/mol;  with  DOCNa  is  47.3kJ/mol  (average
value) and with Triton X-100 is 99.3kJ/mol. On the basis of the above data it can be said that
besides the utilisation of the liposomes in the modelling of cellular membranes, they can be
used as experimental models, too, in order to investigate the solubilization of surfactants.

The interaction of various types of surfactants with lamellar phospholipid aggregates

has been described in the literature [4,5,6]. Surfactants have been applied to study the size and

structure  of  the  formed  mixed  micelles  [7,8,9]  and  the  kinetics  and  the  mechanism  of

membrane  solubilization  [2,3].  In  some  reviews  is  report  the  different  mechanism  of

solubilization multilamellar and unilamellar liposomes [1,5].

Abstract

Introduction

Materials

Chemical Co.

Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine(di-C16PC)  (DPPC)  was  purchased  from  Sigma

Egg  yolk  lecithine  was purchased  from  Sigma  Chemical  Co.  type  X-E  (cat.no.P5394/1996)

purified  by  us  by  neutral  alumina  column  chromatography,  verified  by  thin  layer

chromatography  (silicagel).  The  mobile  phase  was  a  mixture  CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O

(65:30:4,vol).  The  identification  of  the  phospholipid    was  made  with  iodine  and  shows  a

single  spot.  Sodium  deoxycholate  (DOCNa)  was  purchased  from  Merck,  the  Triton  X-100

(TX-100)  from  Sigma  Chemical  Co.  and  Cetyltrimethylammoniumbromid  (CTMB)  from

Fluka AG. Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-HCl (Tris-Cl) was purchased from Austranal.

All  chemicals  and  inorganic  solvents  were  of  analytical  and  of  spectroscopic  grades,

respectively.

Preparation of MLV-DPPC and MLV-egg-yolk lecithin (EYL) suspensions

2.5  mg  DPPC  (SIGMA)  disolved  in  0.2  ml  ethanol  (redistilled  on  P2O5)  or  0.2ml

EYL (78% purity from SIGMA purified by us up to thin layer chromatographic single spot

iodine)  in  chlorophorm:methanol  (9:1,vol)  solution  which  is  in  a  glass  test  tube  was

evaporated under a nitrogen stream until it reached the consistence of a lipid film on the wall

tube settled down. The film was purged with the gas for 30 minutes in order to eliminate the

alcohol  traces.  The  film  hydration  and    bilayer  suspension  were  made  with  sucrose

(CHEMAPOL) solution of 16.6% at 0.6  mg/ml  (lipid/solution)  by    vortexing  10  sec. above
the chain-melting temperature (Tm ∼41,5°C).

Methodology

turbidimetry

By using a spectrophotometer Specol and K-201  I titrated  samples  of 1.5ml  solution  of
MLV-DPPC  0.6mg/ml  (total  1.23µmol  phospholipid)  with  DOCNa  20mM  at  a  4µl/sec

titration  rate  up  to  a  total  addition  of  16µmol  surfactant.  The  titration  was  made  at  several

temperatures between 16 and 22 °C.

2.  Determination  of apparent  activating  energy  of  solubilizing  MLV-EYL  with  surfactants

(DOCNa, TX-100, CTMB) by rectangular optic diffusimetry

By using a spectrophotometer Specol with FR optical diffusion system and photocells and

voltage  source  type  HQE  40  and  UV  lamp  type  OSRAM  it  was  possible  to  determine  the
rectangular  optic  diffusion  at  λ=437nm  of  some  MLV-egg-yolk  lecithin  suspension  (1.4ml,

0.7µmol lipid/sample) in the course of the titration with the surfactant solution. The titration

rate was 0.08µmol surfactant/sec. The tables below include the experimenal data concerning

the total  volume  of  titrant  (expressed  in  µl),  the  total  quantity  of  surfactant  that  was  added

(expressed  in  µmols)  and  modification  of  the  percentage  diffusion  calculated  by  us  being

1cm, as the deflexion unity of the recording pen (∆Dif%/cm). ∆Dif%/µmol surfactant is the

variation of the unity of percentage diffusion, calculated for the 1µmol surfactant addition.

turbidimetry

It  is  known  that  the  titration  curves  in  the  transmission  system  of  SUV-egg-yolk

lecithin have a sigmoidal form, and in the case of MLV-DPPC they are straight.

Table 1 includes the experimental data obtained by spectrophotometric titrations.

the following formulae:

ln(∆Dif%/µmol)2 – ln(∆Dif%/µmol)1
                1000/T2 – 1000/T1

values  (46.7  kJ/mol  and  48kJ/mol,  respectively)  proving  a  good  reproductivity  of  the

determinations.

Because  there  is  a  good  alignment  of  the  three  points  in  Figure  2,  the  calculus  of  apparent

without calculating the straight line regression.

It  is  observed  that  the  solubilization  powers  expressed  in  kinetic  terms,  in  the
condition  of  titrating  at  a  rate  of  0.08µmols  surfactant/sec,  for  the  three  surfactants,  can  be

(5)

arranged in the order:
CTMB<DOCNa<TX-100

Conclusions

Kinetically  the  sequence  of  solubilizing  power  is  CTMB  <  DOCNa  <  TX-100.  This

sequence  shows  that  using  the  same  quantity  of  surfactant,  added  at  the  same  intervals,

determines evolution of solubilizing at different rates.

DOCNa is a more efficient thermodynamically than TX-100 i.e. it solubilizes the MLV-

EYL at molar ratios: surfactant/EYL which are smaller than TX-100. Kinetically TX-100 is

more  efficient  than  DOCNa,  i.e.  it  solubilizes  MLV-EYL  faster  than  DOCNa  at  the  same

temperatures.

On  the  basis  of  the  above  data  it  can  be  said  that  besides  the  utilisation  of  the

liposomes in the modelling of cellular membranes, they can be used as experimental models,

too, in order to investigate the solubilization of surfactants.

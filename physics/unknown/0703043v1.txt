Abstract:  The  problem  of  the  relationships  in  the  system  “the  Information  -  the  Matter”  is
considered. It is shown that there are rather strong grounds to assume that the Information is at most
general  fundamental  concept;  when  the  Matter  (energy)  and  radiation  are  “the  development”
(realization)  of  the  Information.  A  number  of  some  physical  consequences  in  frame  of  suggested
model of the Information as of the essence of the Material World are given.

1. INTRODUCTION

There is rather interesting fact that the discussion – “but what is at all the Information?” in the
scientific, technical and philosophical literature holds many years already in the various directions
without  any  agreed  result.  (R.  Abdeev  [1])  –  “…  depending  on  the  scientific  region  where  the
research were carried out, for the Information a great number of the definitions were obtained: the
Information is some indication of a content that was obtained from external World at the process of
the  adaptation  to  the  world  (Wiener);  the  Information  is  a  negative  entropy  (Brillouin);  the
Information  is  a  communication  when  some  uncertainty  decreases  (Shannon);  the  Information  is
some realization of a variety (Ashby); the Information is something new; the Information is some
measure  of  the  complexity  of  a  structure  (Moll);  the  Information  is  a  probability  of  a  choice
(Yaglom) etc. Every of these definitions reveals one or another aspect of this polysemantic concept
only.”

Without  going  into  the  analysis  of  the  discussion  in  detail,  note  only,  that  the  discussion’s
productivity  appeared  as  rather  poor,  from  what  follows,  e.g.,  the  variety  of  the  definitions  of  the
Information  exist  till  now  in  variety  of  the  published  works.  For  example  in  [2]  D.S.  Chernavsky
gives  not  less  then  20  different  definitions.  Let’s  point  out  on  some  of  the  definitions  (for  more
details, see, e.g., [2]) that are at most different:

1. (The philosophical dictionary) “The Information (lat. informatio – an examination, a notion, a
concept)  –1)  a  report,  a  notification  about  a  state  of  affairs  or  about  something  else  that  is
transmitted by a people; 2) decreased, removed uncertainty as a result of the notation obtained; 3) a
notation  inherently  relating  to  a  control,  the  signals  in  the  unity  of  its  syntactic,  semantic  and
pragmatic  parameters;  4)  transmission,  reflection  of  the  variety  of  any  objects  and  processes  (of
alive and non- alive nature)”;

2.    “The  Information  means  some  order,  a  communication  is  the  creation  of  the  order  from  a
disorder or, at least, growing of the regulation that existed before the communication was obtained”;
3. “The Information is the manifestation of the virtue of the objects of the alive nature to reflect

in the form of some mental sensations the movement of the objects in around world”;

4.  “The  Information…  is  a  quality  of  the  objects,  phenomenons,  processes  in  the  objective
reality,  of  the  controllers  that  were  made  by  human,  which  lies  in  the  capacitance  to  conceive  an
internal state as well as the state and the impacts of an environment and to preserve some time the
results;  to  transmit  the  data  about  the  internal  state  and  cumulative  data  to  another  objects,
phenomenons, processes.”;

5. “The Information is the philosophical category that is considered along with the ones as the
Space,  the  Time  and  the  Matter.  In  at  most  common  form  the  Information  can  be  presented  as  a
notation,  i.e.  a  form  of  some  relations  between  a  source  that  communicates  and  a  receiver  that
obtains a notation”;

6.  “The  Information,  so  as  the  Matter  exists  and  existed  always…  the  Information  is  some
integral  attribute  of  the  Matter  and  Movement  that  realises  some  way  of  the  Matter  existence  and
presents some measure of the changes which follow all processes proceeding in the World”;

 7. (C. Weizsäcker, 1959, cited from [3], page 39.) “Now many peoples begin to get into the way
that it is necessary to consider the Information as something third that differs from the Matter and
the Consciousness… This is Plato’s Idea, Aristotelian form, invested by such a way that the human
of XX century assumes to know something new from it”;

8. (N. Wiener) "Information is information, not matter or energy. No materialism which does not

admit this can survive at the present day” [4]);

9. “The phenomena of the Information is a multi-stage, irreversible process of coming into being
of a structure in some open imbalanced system that begins at a random memorised choice which this
system carries out when it transforms from some chaos to some order, so the process is completed
with a purposeful action according to an algorithm or program that are in accordance to the semantic
of the choice.”[5], and, at last -

10.  “…If  you  will  be  interested  in  the  question  –  “what  is  the  Information?”  and  find
corresponding definition in some book (what is, generally speaking, rather difficult since the authors
keep off to give such a definition), then with great assurance it is possible to say, that other authors
will not agree with this definition.” [6]

From given above one can see that the author [6], as it seems, had some ground for so evident
pessimism.  However,  as  it  will  be  shown  below,  in  reality  the  problem  of  the  definition  of  the
concept – “what is the Information” may be solved in the general way. But the realisations of the
Information indeed are infinitely varied, as well as the semantic of the Information. 

Now  below  we  give  also  some  properties  of  the  Information,  which  aren’t  considered  in  the
scientific  sources  because  of  some  unknown  reasons,  when  these  characteristics  rather  strikingly
reflect the originality of the Information comparing with any other objects/ phenomena of Material
as well as of “non - Material” (i.e. of the Consciousness) Worlds. In the text above we use already
the  word  “Information”  as  some  concept/  phenomena,  when  the  word  “information”  in  the  text
above and further will be used in accordance with the definition 1, i.e. “… a report, a notification
about  a  state  of  affairs  or  about  something  else  that  is  transmitted  by  a  people;  2)  decreased,
removed uncertainty as a result of the notation obtained…”, etc.

The property 1: the Information can not be annihilated. Indeed, the statement “the Information

is annihilated” is false since this statement is some information itself.

The property 2 (rather it is a corollary from the property 1): the Information can exist without
any storing device (including, of course biological beings). That is indeed so, for example, when in
some place a storing device is absentee, there exists the information as true statement “in this place a
storing device  for  an  information is absentee”. Moreover, at  least:  (i)  –  this  statement  contains  all
information about any possible storing devices, (ii) – as well as it contains all information about any
information that could be on these storing device, and (iii) – this information exists in all points, (? –
if the velocity of the Information expansion is infinite. If this velocity is finite, then not in all points,
but  that  will  be  discussed  below)  in  all  points  at  least  of  what  we  call    “the  material  world”
(Universe). 

The  list  of  Information’s  properties  can  be  extended,  and  it  is  not  impossible,  that  it  will  be
infinite, however, that is not the basic topic of this work. The properties above were given, as this

2

was pointed out already, only to illustrate the originality of the Information phenomena, and, as we
think, these properties show that rather adequately and convincingly.

In  this  a  way  the  problem  of  Information  was  considered  by  us  earlier  [7],  [8].  Further  in  the

paper we give some generalisation of the results of these articles.

2. TO THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION

At  the  analysis  of  the  definitions  of  the  concept  of  Information  given  above  one  can  see  that,
regardless to any differences, all definitions have some common feature –any definition contains the
concept  or  even  the  word    “information”  in  left  part  of  the  definition.  The  Information  is
“communication”, “data”, (Plato) “idea”,  “information”, etc. (At all – any definition of any object/
subject/  phenomena  contains  some  information  in  the  left  part.)    So  the  vainness  of  many  years
“experiment” with the attempts to define the Information through something more general concept
shows  that  with  practically  full  confidence  we  can  conclude:  the  concept  of  the  Information  is
utmost general and so can not be reduced to anything what is more general. So Information can be
defined  only  through  the  Information  itself,  or  (but  what  is  evident  -  incompletely)  through  the
Information’s properties. 

However, despite its unique properties and fundamental nature, the Information has  the utmost
common property – the information appears always only if on some set of some elements at least
two logical operations are defined: “identically equal” and “not equal identically”. I.e. when there
exists some alternative, or “the bit of information”.

Besides, note the evident – despite of the originality and fundamental nature of Information, for a
finite systems it is possible to create some language which rather adequately reflects (describes) the
properties  of  the  system,  its  communications,  interactions,  etc.  Though  with  the  constrain  –  if  the
rule  (operation)  set  and  alphabet  in  this  language  are  finite,  then  in  this  there  doesn’t  exist  a  full
system  of  the  concepts  –  “in  any  language  one  can  always  find  a  true  statement  that  can  not  be
proved in this language” [9].

This constrain exists always, but corresponding limits are sufficiently wide in practice to support
some  system’s  functioning  –  there  is  an  example  of  the  arithmetic,  for  which  the  first
incompleteness theorem was proven – the arithmetic can be used rather effectively. If the “can not
being proved” true statement appears in a language, some next concept is put in this language, the
syntax and semantic of the language became revised, and the use of the language becomes widened.
The development of a language is infinite, however, what is very important in this case, in the
physics  (including  the  mathematics  use)  there  weren't  practically  of  the  problems  relating  to  the
incompleteness of the mathematics. What may be possibly as some evidence that our World is finite
also (though, even the World is finite, something will appear later…)

State the aforesaid as a list of utmost important properties of Information:
(1)  The  Information  is  at  most  general  and  fundamental  concept  –  so  it  can  be  defined  only
trough  the  Information  itself,  or  (but  what  is  evident  -  incompletely)  through  the  Information’s
properties. 

(2) The Information can not be annihilated and can exist without the storing device. But, because
of  the  device,  nevertheless,  is  necessary,  so  only  one  variant  is  possible  –  when  the  Information
itself is the storing device for the Information.

Though  (1) and (2) – that the Information can be defined only through itself and that it is the

carrier of itself - are, as a matter of fact, the same.

 Note, also, another important property of Information – in the Information true (that is not fully
correct,  but  the  correction  will  be  below)  statement    “there  is  not  anything”  is  possible.  If
somebody  try  to  analyze  this  statement,  it  becomes  evident,  that  this  statement  contains,  though

3

implicitly,  all  (infinite)  information  about  all  as  the  statements  “there  is  not  the  object/  event/
process X”. For example (till the moment when this paper appear) – the statement “there is not the
paper “the Information and the Matter” contained all data relating to this paper. I.e., the statement
“there is not anything” is some “logical zero” which is some analogue of the mathematical zero
that contains, in some sense, all points of the complex plane even the real and imaginary parts of the
plane are continuous.

Now  we  make  the  promised  correction  of  the  statement.  Indeed,  the  statement  «there  is  not
anything» is incorrect, since there exists at least the information that there is not anything.  So the
correct statement is infinite cyclical series “there is not anything but the information that there is
not anything but the information…”  It is rather possible, that the generation of such a cyclical
logical series is one of important properties of Information also.

Note, also, that the statement  “there is not…” contains also any possible false information, i.e.

the information which is logically inconsistent in (some) given finite system, e.g., - in our World.

The main objective of this paper is the consideration of the relationship “the Information – the
Matter”. Since already for a rather long time there is not a consensus in the definition – “what is the
Matter” there can occur some uncertainties in understanding of this concept. So to decrease possible
speculation, note, regarding to the physical experiment, that the interactions in the systems of any
physical objects “are true”. The false information can be created only by so called  “alive” objects,
as well as only “alive” objects can to apprehend it. Correspondingly (and without essential loss of
generality)  further  consideration  relates  to  the  objects/  phenomena/  processes  that  can  interact/  be
described  only  in  logically  true  manner,  so  they  are  “non  -alive”.    These  “non  -alive”  objects/
phenomena/ processes and its bonds are the constitutions of the “Matter” in this paper.

3.  INFORMATION  AND  THE  PROBLEM  OF  CREATION/  EXISTENCE  OF  THE
MATTER 

There are two possible variants for the existent material World (Universe):
(i) – the World exists infinitely, without the Beginning and the End  in the Time, and
(ii)  -  the  World  exists  some  finite  time  (and,  what  is  not  impossible,  without  the  End    in  the

Time)

The choice between the variants – is a question of a belief, because of now there aren’t the data
that could be sufficient evidence of what variant is true. However, if the variant (ii) is true, then it is
follow that until the Beginning:

(a) -  there existed true information in the form of recurring  infinite (but consisted of finite set of
concepts) “Until Beginning” statement (UBS)  that was given above already: “there is not anything
but the information that…”;
(b) - nothing else existed;
(c)  –  As  it  was  pointed  out  earlier,  the  information  in  the  UBS  was  infinite  and  contained  all
information  about  all,  including  the  information  relating  to  creation  and  evolution  at  least  of  our
World. 

For the variant (ii), from (a), (b), and (c) it strictly follows, that:
(d) – our material World was generated from the Information; and
(e) – since the    World formed from the Information then now it is some system that consists of

some (including - ordered) informational structures (IS).

Note, also, that for the variant (i) the statement, that the World is some system that consists of

some IS, is not prohibited.

4

Any concept in any language is the concept only if it is in some relationship with another ones.
I.e. any concept implicitly contains all information about all the possible as the statement “Not I”, so
it forms with its negation a bit of information “I/ Not I”

UBS  together  with  its  negation  “something  exists  and  exists  the  information  that  something

exists…» formed “Up-to -Beginning” bit of information.

So there exist all grounds to conclude, that, if our World (Universe) had the Beginning then it
was generated from Information, consequently now it is some system of some interactive IS, i.e. the
World is some similarity of a computer. The human does not observe these IS directly and does not
read “initial information” (in a similar manner a human does not observe the switching of the logical
elements in the chips of a computer and see only the pictures on a monitor).  He see (register by the
instruments) a result of the work of a “software” that was developed by the Nature, something like
as  –  directly  a  human  communicates  with  the  Nature  through  “Windows”;  by  using  the  general
physics  lows  –  through  the  “Fortran”  language;  by  using  the  quantum  mechanics  and  the
mathematics – through the “Assembler” language, etc. The main objective (and it is not impossible
–  the  result)  of  proposed  here  “informational”  conception  in  the  physics  is  the  further  detailed
elaboration of our ideas about the World.

In  this  paper  we  do  not  consider  the  applications  of  the  Shannon  -  Brillouin  theory  of
information, because of just determinate processes underlie in the base of the World (so do of the
physics)  and  determinate  lows  govern  these  processes.  Mainly  by  such  a  way  the  World  exists,
evolves  and  is  cognising.  Therefore,  for  the  development,  as  well  as  for  the  application,  of  the
informational  conception,  it  is  important  to  use  the  properties  of  Information  that  are  investigated
first  of  all  in  the  set  theory,  or,  more  specifically,  in  the  theory  of  the  symbolic  (algorithmic)
languages. 

The Information in the World develops (comes to be) as a complication of the physical systems
at the interactions of the simplest IS – the elementary particles. Further assume, that these IS consist
of  some  fundamental  logical  elements  (FLE)  of  the  information  –  some  analogues  of  the  logical
elements in a computer, when in the FLEs some logical statements are used instead of transistors,
diodes, etc.  

Such  a  hypothesis  is  not  new  –  the  assumptions  that  the  World  is  a  Computer  appeared
practically  at  once  with  the  widening  of  the  computers  application,  i.e.  in  50  –  60  of  XX  century
[10],  [11].  However  the  main  problems  –  what  is  “  the  Ultimate  (Universe)  Computer  ”;  how  it
could be originated; what could be its “elemental base”; how it could be controlled, etc., - were not
solved till now. For example in [11] the statement: “As to where the Ultimate Computer is, we can
give  an  equally  precise  answer;  it  is  not  in  the  Universe  -  it  is  in  an  other  place  ”  -  is  one  of  the
principal  conceptions  of  the  E.  Fredkin  “digital  philosophy”.    A  non-productivity  of  such  a
conception  is  rather  obvious,  however,  in  these  works  there  was  considered  the  critical  for  the
Ultimate Computer existence problem – the problem of the creation and work of the “inertial”
computers,  i.e.  the  computers  that  do  not  dissipate  (so  do  not  consume)  the  energy  at  its  work,
and it was shown that such a computers can be indeed made.

4. SOME CONSEQUENCES FROM THIS INFORMATION CONCEPT 

4.1.  One of the main physics problems – the problem of the Universe's creation becomes much
clearer. Now there is a lot of the evidences that may be explained at most logically if the hypothesis
that the World was originated as a result of a “Big Bang” in a point having “energy singularity”. The
main problem of this hypothesis, i.e. – the deficiency of starting energy 1085 – 1090 MeV – is taken

5

away in the informational conception, since the logical singularity of the UBS is infinite and the true
information in the UBS was enough to create the World. 

4.2. It becomes understandable one of the fundamental  postulates  of  the  quantum  mechanics  –
the postulate that all elementary particles of given kind are identical when this postulate is definitely
in  the  contradiction  with  other  fundamental  QM  postulate  –  about  principal  stochasticity  of  the
processes  in  the  microworld.  Now  it  is  known  only  one  case  when  it  is  possible  to  ensure  the
identity of something, viz - the identity of the information. At that any informational structure can be
reproduced in any number of copies. So it is rather possible that the elementary particles are some
informational clones.

4.3  It  becomes  understandable  the  startling  adequacy  of  the  languages  of  the  mathematics,

physics, other sciences for the description of the processes in the material world.

4.4. The Space and the Time. It follows from the experience that the information can exist in two
kinds  –  a  specified  (fixed)  information  (e.g.  –  ascertaining/  description  of  some  fact;  a  computer
code listing, etc.) and a dynamic information (e.g. –data processing on a computer; changes of state
in  a  physical  system).  From  the  logical  corollary  that  the  Information  can  not  be  annihilated  it
follows, that at some changes in a physical systems in the World, so in the World as whole,  next
Information  “picture  area”  can  not  “  wipe”  the  antecedent  one.  So  the  changing  of  the  “picture
areas” appears for an observer as the Time. From this it follows, that:

- the Time is discrete (quantified); and
- the Time has one direction.
The different informational structures in the World should consist of the different FLEs, because
of different ISs are informatively separated. The informational separation appears for an observer
as the “space” separation. Besides, for the interactions of separated ISs, e.g., for the gravitational
interaction, it is at least sufficient if between separate ISs there were some (possibly another then the
FLEs of the ISs) FLEs to transmit the interactions (some information) between the structures – some
“ether” FLEs.  The populations of the structures FLEs (further – “t-FLEs”) and of the “ether” FLEs
(further – “e-FLEs”)  as a whole is the Space. It is evident, that the Space is discrete (quantified).

The  fact  that  the  space-time  continuum  hypothesis  contains  some  insuperable  logical  self-
contradictions  was  cleared  up  already  2500  years  ago  when  Zenon  stated  his  aporias.  Now  to  the
same conclusion also the physics goes when it faced with various divergences at the development of
the field theories.

Because  of  the  interactions  between  elementary  ISs  are  random  and  small  as  well  as  since  the
FLE's  dimensions  are  very  small  too,  the  Space  and  the  Time  are  observed  (till  now)  as  they  are
uniform and continuos.

5. THE MODEL

The  use  of  the  informational  conception  from  one  hand  –  is  not  in  contradiction  with  existing
physical theory, from the other – creates the possibility to develop rather reasonable interpretation of
some  concepts  in  the  physics  that  now  are  put  in  the  theory  rather  formally  and/  or  are  not
reasonably grounded till now.  Some examples (the deficit of the energy in “Big Bang” hypothesis,
the problem of the identity of elementary particles) already are given above. Below this conception
is used to some conceptual physical problems within the framework of some model.

5.1. The “development” (the realisation) of the Information in material World

As it was pointed out earlier,  the informational approach means that anything in the  World is
transformations and interactions of the ISs, including that the elementary particles are some ISs also.
For any IS in the World, including the particles, the common is that the interactions in some system

6

result in changes of the energetic states and/ or the changes of the parameters of the movement in the
space. At that the at most general physical lows are the lows of the conversation of energy, linear
momentum and angular momentum. The particle energy at the interaction changes discretely, on the
quanta that are equal hν, where ν - is some frequency and h – is Planck’s constant. I.e. the particles
are  some  informational  currents  when  Planck’s  constant  is  some  fundamental  parameter  of  the
discreteness  on  the  energy.  At  the  free  movement  of  a  particle  in  the  space  its  reference  changes
,

randomly,  though  (in  some  sense)  periodically  according  to  the  de  Broglie  formulae 
where λ  is  the  wave  length,  p  –  its  moment.  So  the  Planck’s  constant  is,  also,  some  fundamental
parameter  of  the  discreteness  of  the  movement  in  the  space.  Third  fundamental  parameter  of  the
movement is the angular momentum. As it is well known from quantum mechanics the change of a
angular momentum is also divisible to h: 

, and  l  is some integer number.

So, we can built two variants of the informational currents (IC) –the time IC and the space IC
and one variant for fixed information using only at most common physical parameters and Planck’s
constant:

the time IC (t-IC): 

-

However, it seems that it is not just so. The relationship (5) means, first of all, that the angular
. Indeed, observable minimal angular moment
momentum of some particle can not be less then  π4/h
(spin) is equal to this value when the change of the momentum can not be less then  π2/h
. From
that it follows that in some system of particles the distance of any particles to any axis can not be
equal zero, for example – in an atom any electron  never  “stick”  to  a  nuclei.  Besides  note  that  the
angular momentum changing (and, correspondingly, the information in the Planck’s constant unity)
. So the angular momentum
doesn’t equal to the Planck’s constant bat is given with the factor  π2/1
is not, in some sense some time IC (or some space IC, since this IC has the dimensionality [1/t] also)
informational current, but it is some informational current in some fundamental angular reference.

5.3. The reference frames

There is an old something like as an anecdote: two electrons fly through the SLAC’s pipe. On
says to other: “and where they took so much energy to boost this pipe to such an energy?”  I.e., even
the  inertial  reference  frames  in  the  finite  World  aren’t  equivalent,  at  least  –  if  one  looks  at  the
practical  realization  of  the  frame.    On  the  other  hand  earlier  we  put  some  premise  that  the  space
should consist of some e-FLEs to transmit the information between the particles at the interactions.
So some “ether” should exist and, correspondingly, some unique reference frame in the Universe. In
spite of some “revolt” of the premise, such a frame should exist if the Big Bang hypothesis is true –
this  is  the  centre  mass  system,  where  sum  time  IC  of  all  particles  and  radiation  is  minimal.
Additionally from Eq.(5) it follows, that sum angular momentum of all particles and radiation can
not be equal zero (and conserves from the Creation) , i.e. in the Universe there is, also some unique
axis.

5.4. The elementary particles as the informational structures of the material World

2

At realisation of the IC of some particle it interacts with e-FLEs that interact with e-FLEs of the
next “layer”, etc. It is obvious that the flux density of the “switchings” of the e-FLEs diminishes as
/1 r ,  and,    when  the  front  of  the  flux  reaches  some  another  particle  it  is  possible  some  universal
(which  doesn’t  depend  on  the  characteristics    of  a  specific  particle)  interaction  which,  since  any
other interactions are specific,  indeed is the gravity.

Note also, that every fundamental elementary particle has its self-Time that is determined by its
t-IC.  The  rate  of  the  change  of  the  Time  in  a  system  of  particles  is  determined  by  minimal  time
interval between “switchings” of the t-FLEs of the particles that constitute the system. The system’s
Time  always  changes  as  a  result  of  at  least  gravitational  interaction  between  the  system’s
components.  Correspondingly  the  Time  of  the  components  is  determined  also  by  the  speed  of  the
gravitational interaction. Here we assume that this speed is equal the speed of light, c.

As  it  is  assumed  now  in  the  physics  theory  (there  are  some  experimental  evidences)  that  the
elementary  particles  are  divided  into  fundamental  and  derived  (that  are  composed  of  the
fundamental particles). In turn the fundamental particles include the quarks an the leptons. Besides
there  is  so  called  “exchange”  particles  (mediators),  i.e.  the  particles  that  are  necessary  to  mediate
some interactions – the photon, the gluon, the mesons (at the strong forces). 

In the proposed model all particles are some informational currents and its values are determined

by Eqs. (1)-(3).

 It is well known that the transformation of the information in some physical (a computer) and
biological  systems  needs  in  rather  essential  energy  expenses.  If  the  Universe’s    “Ultimate
Computer” (E. Fredkin, [11]) works in the same way as, e.g., a PC, then even after very big “Big
Bang”  it  must  to  stop,  including  the  stopping  of  the  elementary  particles  informational  currents.
However at least some of the particles are stable, the proton’s half-life, e.g., exceeds 1020 years. As

8

it was noted here above, in the works of E. Fredkin, Т. Toffoli., N. H. Margolus (see, e.g. [11]) as
early as 70-80 years of former century it was shown that it is possible to make “inertial” computer
which  works  without  the  dissipation  of  the  energy  and  there  were  suggested  some  variants  of  the
logical  elements  to  built  such  a  computer.  One  of  utmost  important  condition  when  the  computer
may be made is the reversibility of its logical elements. I.e. this computer must work in both – in a
direct and in corresponding reverse order. Turning back to the problem of the t-ICs of the (at least of
stable)  elementary  particles  it  is  rather  reasonable  to  suppose  that  the  particles  are  some  cyclic
informational structures with rather short (since the particles periods experimentally do not observed
till  now,  except  the  one  for  the  photon)  periods  of  the  t-IC  –  cycle,  when  the  structure’s  logical
elements  (t-FLEs)  are  reversible.  So  if  the  particles  t-ICs  are  some  direct  algorithmic  codes  then
corresponding antiparticles are the codes with reciprocal code order. At that the antiparticle “lives”
as if in the negative time as it was assumed by P. Dirac already in the first half of past century. Since
the  t-FLSs  are  fundamentally  reversible,  the  possibility  of  the  antiparticles  follows  from  the
existence of the particles.  Experimental discovery of the antiparticles practically for any (except for
come  exchange  particles)  particles  indicates  that  the  existence  of  the  particles  with  the  reversible
code order is not only possible but is necessary in material World.

It  is  rather  obvious  that  any  algorithm  should  have  the  start  and  the  end  (that  for  a  cyclic
algorithm is as usual the start). Utmost probable candidate for the “start” FLE in a particle is some
fixed information (the FLE is in the stable state). Such a information exists – this is the particle’s
spin. At that spin  ½  (“one half of the bit”) is  minimal information that can be used as “start/ stop”
FLE, when “normal” FLE should have at least two (one bit)  possible states.

It is rather reasonable also to assume that  “start/ stop” FLE for a fundamental cycle should be
minimal  and  that  is  confirmable  experimentally  –  all  fundamental  elementary  particles  are  the
fermions. An unique exception is the mediators – the photon and the gluon, however, as it will be
shown below, it seems that these particles, nevertheless, aren’t  such a exception.

For any particle having antiparticle the number of steps in the cycle can not be less the three – in
the  case  of  two  steps  it  is  possible  only  the  “there  and  back”  cycle  in  one  algorithm.
Correspondingly 1(2)- step (so – the simplest) algorithms can be used only if a particle have not the
antiparticle, or more correctly – the particles in which the particle and antiparticle are integrated in
one particle. To reverse the cycle in this case it is necessary to have additional “start/ stop” FLE, so
1(2)-step algorithm IS should have the spin 1. Utmost probable candidate  in this case is the photon.
Then  the  gluon,  it  seems,  is  a  3  (6)  -steps  (3  colours  of  the  gluon)  “there  and  back”  integrated
algorithm.  At  that  the  gluon  interacts  with  corresponding  quark  in  corresponding  state  [step,
direction  of  the  step].  Note,  that  to  obtain  necessary  number  of  the  states  (8)  and  even  more,  it  is
sufficient to use a 2(4)-steps algorithm, however 3 (6) –steps algorithm seems more symmetrical. 

5.5. Elementary particles and mediation of the forces

The  informational  model  of  the  interaction  between  particles  follows  logically  from  the
informational  model  of  the  particles.  Now  it  is  known  4  kinds  of  the  interactions  (4  forces)  –
gravitational,  weak,  electromagnetic  (EM),  strong.    At  that  the  strong,  EM  and  week  forces  in
relatively cold matter (order of value the temperature a number of GeV) differ on 2-3 orders. The
gravity force is critically weaker, e.g. for the proton the difference relating to EM force is near 36
orders of value. In the cases of EM and strong forces it is discovered experimentally fundamental
mediating particles – the photon and the gluon. The strong forces are mediated also by the mesons if
there is some system of strongly interacting particles. 

In  suggested  model  the  mediating  particle  appears  just  naturally  –  this  particle  is  some
intermediate algorithm aimed at to synchronize and to unify in some part (on some time) the steps of
t-ICs  of interactive  particles, if it is possible. Then the rate of unified steps of the particles is the
binding energy of the system. If the unification is impossible then there a scattering occurs.

9

Note  the  property  that  all  mediators  have  independently  on  the  force  –  all  mediators  are  the
bosons  and  have  the  spin  1.  As  it  was  pointed  earlier  the  fundamental  cycle  has  spin  ½.  So  it  is
natural to assume that all mediators are the combinations of two “1/2” cycles; at that one cycle has
direct  when  the  second  has  reverse  steps  orders  in  the  time.  Fur  the  mesons  it  is  observed
experimentally – all mesons are the systems “quark + antiquark”.  Fundamental mediators – photon
and gluon – are not split on some components experimentally till now, i.e. these particles are “true”
bosons. True bosons have the rest masses equal zero.

From this seems as rather  reasonable at least 2 corollaries:
- all particles having non-integer spin are not the combination of “there and back” cycles, the
particle has either “there” (particle) or “back” (antiparticle) cycle. Correspondingly the resulting
t-IC of the particle is not equal zero so any particle having non-integer spin can not have the zero
rest mass. For example the neutrino rest mass is not zero also;

-  the  wave  functions  of  the  photon  and  the  gluon  should  have  some  decomposition  on  two
integrated components with the spins ½. The components should have opposite dependencies on the
time – something like as the wave function of a meson. For the photon these components are known
– they are the electrical and magnetic components.

5.5.1. The mediation of the forces. A model.

So, in the rather cold Universe there exist at least 4 forces between the particles – gravitational,

weak, EM, strong that relate, e.g., for the proton approximately as 10-36:10-3:1:103 .

In  framework  of  informational  model  it  is  possible  to  explain  (subject  to  what  was  considered

earlier) this situation as:

(1)  –  the  gravity  force  is  universal  and  acts  always  as  an  attraction.  At  that  the  gravitational
binding energy in a system of some bodies is equal the number of “swithchings” of the t-FLEs of the
ICs of the particles of these bodies that accidentally coincide in the time. Under this suggestion it
follows,  that:  (i)  –  the  gravity  force  should  be  very  week,  and  (ii)  –  there  is  not  the  necessity  in
special mediator, i.e. the graviton can not exist.

(2) If a binding algorithm (so –corresponding particle-mediator) appears, the corresponding force
increases crucially. And this force increases with increase of the complexity of the mediator, what is
apparent  on  the  example  of  the  photon  and  the  gluon;  of  the  EM  and  strong  forces.  As  some
analogue  is  the  known  exponential  increase  of  the  efficiency  of  computation  in  the  quantum
computers where the q-bit logical elements are used instead of the bit- elements in common ones.

5.5.2. The gravity

Above we assumed that, since the gravity: (i) – is some universal, i.e. it does not depend on any
other fundamental forces (so on any characteristics of these forces) force; (ii) – is observable only as
an attraction, i.e. the binding energy in a system of some bodies is always negative; and (iii) – is very week
force, then it is rather possible that the gravity appears at the random coincidences of some steps of the time
ICs  of  some  information  structures.  To  develop  this  suggestion  it  is  possible  to  make  some  mathematical
consideration.

Let be two bodies having masses 
1, mm

Then the “Newtonian” binding energy is

 when the distance between the bodies is equal r.

where G is Newtonian constant of gravitation.

On the other hand, at a “switching” of a t-FLE of the particles that are the components of these
bodies in the space some “ether”’s e-FLE  “switchings”  start and, further, these “switchings” spread
as some threads  radially in the space. If a thread reaches a body the probability of the coincidence
of  the  e-FLE  “switching”  and  of  a  particle’s  t-FLE  “switching”  is  proportional  to  the  ISs  of  the
particles, coincidence time and the gravitational cross section and is inversely proportional to r2. 

 
Let the bodies consist of different elementary particles, e.g. – let the body 1 consists of the I

kinds of the particles and the body 2 – of K kinds of the particles having, correspondingly the
masses m10i  и m20k.  

So the bodies masses are equal

Assume further that:
- the speed of the gravitational thread spreading is equal the speed of light, c;
- the t- and e-FLE’s sizes are equal to Plank’s length,  lP;

-  gravitational  cross  section  if  a  particle  of  the  kind  i  “radiates”, σi,  is:

As a example let us consider gravitational binding energy in the system [Earth – body 2, m2=1

For the simplicity assume that Earth and the body 2 consist of the hydrogen, i.e. of the protons
and  the  electrons  and  numbers  of  the  protons  and  electrons  having  masses mp  ,  me  are  equal.  The
Earth’s mass is equal 5.973.1024 kg; the distance between the bodies is equal the Earth’s radius, i.e.
6.37.106  m.  The  cross  section  of

Neglecting the coincidences in the electrons assume that all coincidences occur in the protons.
Then  mean  coincidence  rate  in  1  kg  of  hydrogen  on  the  Earth’s  surface,  Ncc1,  is  equal:
Ncc1≈9.5.1040s-1;  and  mean  coincidence  rate  in  a  proton  is  equal  Nccр≈1.6.1014  s-1,  i.e.  ≈10-9  of  the
proton’s informational current.

6. THE EXPERIMENT?

6.1 The experiments with measurement of gravitational force. Atoms interference [12].
 
As it follows from Eq.(8), the value of the gravitational (coincidence) current in any particle is
random in the time. Correspondingly so do the gravitational force that impacts on this particle. So
some  uncertainty  should  appear  at  gravitational  interaction  of  some  small  masses.    If  one  of  the
masses is a gas (e.g. [12]), then the distribution of the molecule momentums in the gas should have
additional uncertainty in the direction on second body under gravitational impact of this body. That
can  result,  e.g.  in  an  additional  uncertainty  in  the  experiments  intended  for  the  measurement  of
Newtonian constant of gravitation.
Consider an example. Let:
- the mass  of the body 2 is equal 100kg; 
- the gas in the body 1 is hydrogen;
- the distance between the bodies, r, = 0.1 m.
Then  the  mean  gravitational  IC  in  a  hydrogen  atoms  is  equal  ~0.17  s-1,  however,  some  atoms
should  have  the  IC  equal  ~  5s-1  with  the  probability  ~  10-6.  At  every  interaction  “switching”  the
proton gets the momentum h/r what corresponds to the atom’s shift at IC equal 5s-1 on ~ 10-5 m in
the  first  second.  Such  a  shift  (or  its  some  equivalent)  can  be,  in  principle,  measured  in  an
experiment, for example after some modification of the technique described in [12].  

6.2. The experiments with measurement of gravitational force. The “free -fall” experiment 

In the “free fall” experiment to determine the G- constant [13] a small test mass, m, falls in the

Earth gravitational field disturbed by the “source mass”, m1.

It can be rather easily shown that the total relative uncertainty of G-constant determination that
appears because of the randomness of binding energy in the system [m - (ME+m1)] of the Earth and
source mass is equal:

where r – is the distance between test and source masses, ME and RE are the mass and the radius of
Earth,  ∆t  –  the  time  constant  of  the  instrument.    Note  that  the  first  term  in  square  brackets  is
proportional the density of the matter of a planet, so the uncertainty will be the same on any planet
having the density equal to the Earth’s one.

So, for known accuracy of the technique, δT, the test mass, under condition that the uncertainty

due to the randomness of the gravity impacts is equal to the technique accuracy, should be equal:

In  the  technique  [13]  these  parameters  are:  source  mass,  m1=500kg;  uncertainty,  δI  ~10-3;

r~0.1m; ∆t ~0.01 s. For these values the test mass is equal, m ~  8.4.10-23 kg, i.e. ~ 5.104 H-atoms.

With the increasing of r the tests mass increases. Note, however, that it follows simultaneously
to the decrease of the force on the test mass what can result in the worsening of the accuracy of the
technique.

From Eq.(12) it follows, also, that the additional uncertainty in “classic” experiments, e.g. in the
“time-of-swing” method [14], is negligible since that the masses involved in these experiments are
rather large.

7. CONCLUSION

Some scantiness of this paper is obvious – there is not the clarity in the problem how the FLEs
can be created from the Information, it is considered only some (and may be not fully correct) first
approximation  of  the  model  of  the  kinematics  and  the  gravity,  etc.  But  such  a  situation  is  quite
natural if one takes into account the novelty of suggested conception. It is also natural that, like as
the  “traditional”  physics,  the  informational  conception  starts  considering  utmost  general  and  so  at
most “simple” physical problems – the problems of a material point movement and of the gravity.
The detailed elaboration of these problems as well as the development of the conception relating to
other physical forces and so to the development of the informational models of the complex systems
(atoms, molecules, etc) is a matter of the future.

However already now it is possible to believe with some confidence further development of the

conception. As it seems, it will develop on three basic closely interrelated courses.

The  first  one  is  some  “  interosculation”  of  the  traditional  and  informational  approaches  in  the

physical theory:

-  the development of the relativistic formulation of the informational conception;
-  the clarification of the substance of the electromagnetic force  and the electric (as well as of the
magnetic) charge; in particular – the development of the wave function for the photon as of some
integrated  two –component structure;

- the creation of the informational formulations of the quantum mechanics and of the theory of

the elementary particles. 

On the second course the developments of the logical elements and some algorithms relating to
the models of the particles should be carried out.  It is necessary to seek for the reversible logical
elements  in  addition  to  Toffoli  –  Fredkin  schemes  and  corresponding  fixed  “half-bit”  start/stop

13

elements that allow constructing the particle models taking into account known physical limitations.
At first, as it seems, a “cybernetic” model of the photon will be developed. Further one can wait the
development  of  the  “cybernetic”  models  of  the  electromagnetic  interaction  and  of  the  hydrogen
atom. 

On the third course – some physical applications of the set theory, first of all – of the theory of
symbolic  languages  will  be  studied.  It  is  not  impossible  that  here  rather  interesting  results  can  be
obtain, in both – in the physics and in the mathematics.

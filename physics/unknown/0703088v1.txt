Abstract 
 
An approach reported recently by Alexandrov et al.  1 on optical scatter imaging, termed 
digital Fourier microscopy (DFM), represents an adaptation of digital Fourier holography 
to selective imaging of biological matter.  Holographic mode of recording of the sample 
optical  scatter  enables  reconstruction  of  the  sample  image.    Form-factor  of  the  sample 
constituents  provides  a  basis  for  discrimination  of  these  constituents  implemented  via 
flexible  digital  Fourier  filtering  at  the  post  processing  stage.    Like  in  the  dark-field 
microscopy,  the  DFM  image  contrast  appears  to  improve  due  to  the  suppressed  optical 
scatter  from  extended  sample  structures.    In  this  paper,  we  present  theoretical  and 
experimental  study  of  DFM  using  biological  phantom  that  contains  polymorphic 
scatterers.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
The  intricate  morphology  of  biological  matter  presents  a  challenge  to  biomedical 
imaging.  Typically, it  is manifested by low visibility features of interest on a crowded 
background  of  biological  or  cellular  tissue.    Therefore,  the  suppression  of  obscuring 
backgrounds in favour of features (termed gating), e.g. a cell organelle on the background 
of  a  live  cell  culture,  represents  an  important  research  focus  in  biomedical  imaging.  
There  are  several  strategies  to  address  this  problem.    In  confocal  microscopy,  out-of-
plane morphological layout of a biological specimen is suppressed in favour of the image 
plane  of  interest  situated  at  the  focal  plane  2.    Another  approach  widely  used  in

biomedical  imaging  is  the  labelling  of  biological  constituent  under  study,  this  enables 
efficient discrimination relative to a non-labelled background 3. 
  
Recently, a novel gating approach, termed optical scatter imaging (OSI), was successfully 
demonstrated by Boustany et al.  4.  This approach can be classified as Fourier filtering, 
and  is  applicable  for  thin  low-scattering  biological  samples.    It  was  demonstrated  that 
OSI  was  sensitive  to  the  minute  size  variations  of  the  specimen  constituents.    In  the 
transfer  plane  of  the  OSI  imaging  train  terminated  by  a  CCD  camera,  a  field  stop  and 
variable diaphragm were placed to record two consecutive images.  The first image was 
recorded with the diaphragm wide-open, this permitted collection of large-angle optical 
scatter.    The  second  image  was  recorded  with  a  reduced  diaphragm  opening  that 
permitted  collection  of  the  small-angle  optical  scatter.    The  ratio  of  the  two  images 
allowed  clear  observation  of  cell  apoptosis,  a  process  which  results  in  the  swelling  of 
sub-micron  cell  organelles.    These  same  changes  were  undetectable  in  phase-contrast 
microscopy  4.    Also,  the  preferential  orientation  of  the  major  constituents  of  the 
biological specimen has been demonstrated to be uniquely detectable using modified OSI 
5.  
 
The power of OSI is derived by the following properties:  Firstly, OSI belongs to a family 
of dark-field microscopy, since it contains a field stop at the centre of the transfer plane 6.  
Here a major portion of the optical radiation scattered in small angles (small-angle optical 
scatter), predominantly originating  from the extended structures, is blocked by the field 
stop.  As a result, the optical scatter is redistributed to boost its large-angle wing, with the 
effect of increased contrast of the small objects.  The removal of the small-angle excess 
radiation from the detection channel affords multi-fold increase of the illumination power 
on the sample before the CCD camera saturates.  Secondly, the sample optical scatter is 
controlled in OSI via operation of the diaphragm opening in the transfer plane and can be 
thought  as  implementation  of  Fourier  filtering  in  hardware.    The  application  of  this 
filtering has enabled the discrimination of subwavelength-size scatterers 4.  This property 
is equivalent to the Fourier filtering that further enhances the OSI imaging performance 
and also provides additional information on the specimen scattering constituents.  Despite 
these merits, OSI has several limitations.  Among those, the optical scatter is controlled 
in hardware, which is slow in its current implementation.   Also, the choice of the  field 
stop  and  diaphragm  shapes  are  hitherto  limited  to  circular  geometries,  whereas  angular 
scatter can be profoundly asymmetric 5.  Most importantly, phase of the optical scatter is 
lost in the OSI detection, this ultimately precludes optimal image processing.  
 
In  order  to  overcome  the  limitations  of  OSI,  a  new  approach  has  been  introduced  to 
record and control the optical scatter based on digital Fourier holography, which we call 
digital  Fourier  microscopy  (DFM)  1.    In  DFM,  the  full  optical  scatter  information  is 
preserved since optical field amplitude and phase are recorded on the transfer plane using 
a CCD camera.  This recording method enables efficient and adaptable Fourier filtering 
of the acquired holograms followed by sample image reconstruction in software 7, 8.  The 
most  intense  small-angle  optical  scatter  is  considerably  de-emphasised  in  favour  of  the 
large-angle  scatter  by  virtue  of  the  limited  dynamic  range  of  a  CCD  camera.    This 
underpins  the  field-stop  action  of  DFM  and  can  be,  to  some  extent,  controlled  by  the

reference  and  object  optical  illumination.    OSI  merits  such  as  small  object  contrast 
enhancement and Fourier filtering capacity, are preserved in DFM.  At the same time, the 
main  OSI  limitations  derived  from  its  hardware  implementation  of  the  Fourier  filtering 
are eliminated by transferring the optical image processing to the post-processing stage.   
 
The  use  of  digital  Fourier  holography  1  to  perform  optical  scatter  imaging  represents  a 
major departure from the previously reported approaches.  A comprehensive account on 
principles, methods and algorithms of digital holography has been given by Yaroslavsky 
9.    The  maturity  of  digital  sensor  and  computing  technology  has  provided  a  significant 
impetus to new developments in the field of digital holography  10, this has a distinctive 
emphasis on biomedical imaging applications.  It has been demonstrated that the state-of-
the-art  digital  holography  techniques  are  capable  of  3D-imaging  of  live  biological 
specimen,  e.g.  cells,  at  sub-video  frame  rate  with  subwavelength  axial  resolution  11,  12.  
The  use  of  holographic  filters  for  imaging  of  biological  tissue  has  been  also  recently 
demonstrated  by  Yu  et  al.  13.    Until  recently,  the  use  of  Fourier  holography  has  been 
limited  to  pattern  recognition  and  optical  computing  applications  6,  9.    Most  recently, 
Sebesta and Gustaffson have demonstrated the promise of digital Fourier holography for 
delineation of the embedded dielectric objects based on their refractive indices 14.   In this 
work,  we  present  a  theoretical  and  experimental  study  of  the  key  properties  of  digital 
Fourier  microscopy,  including  its  Fourier  filtering  capacity  and  small  object  contrast 
enhancement.  
 
The  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  In  Section  2,  we  will  introduce  digital  Fourier 
microscopy  and  detail  its  basic  theoretical  model,  including  comparative  analysis  of 
image  contrast of DFM, and direct imaging  methods.   Details of the DFM experiments 
are presented in Section 3.  Experimental results and discussion are addressed in Section 
4 and 5, respectively, after which we will draw several concluding remarks. 
 
2. Theory 
 
2.1 Digital Fourier Microscopy 
 
A  simplified  diagram  of  digital  Fourier  microscopy  is  shown  in  figure  1.    An  object  is 
placed at the front focal plane of a Fourier lens LF, of focal length fF, that contains a CCD 
camera  at  its  back  focal  plane,  commonly  called  the  transfer  plane.    A  collimated 
monochromatic  light  beam  is  equally  split  between  reference  and  object  arms.    In  the 
reference arm the light beam is coupled into a single-mode optical fibre OF whose distal 
end is positioned at the front focal plane.  Light emerging from this fibre is collimated by 
LF,  and  propagates  as  a  quasi  plane  wave  at  an  angle  to  the  optical  axis.    In  the  object 
arm,  the  incident  light  field  is  disturbed  by  an  object,  which  is  describable  in  the 
framework  of  light  scattering.    This  optical  disturbance  is  projected  onto  the  transfer 
plane by means of LF.  Assume that the object is optically thin, i.e. its thickness is less

In both cases, the integration is assumed over the entire 2D space.  As is evident from the 
observation of Eq.  (1), the optical  field disturbance 
 at the object plane  can be 
reconstructed  by  performing  a  2D-Fourier  transform  that  is  conveniently  implemented 
using  digital  recording  and  processing  technologies.  Examination  of  Eq. (1)  shows  that

of  the  3D-reconstruction  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper,  although  it  represents  an 
interesting topic of future research on DFM.  In the following sub-sections, we will make 
several observations regarding imaging properties of DFM.

Eq. (1) shows that the 2D-Fourier transform 

F

, describes an envelope of the 

hologram  determined  by  the  object  form-factor  (shape,  size),  and  relative  refractive 
index, i.e. a ratio of refractive index of the object to that of the background medium.  In 
the case of an  ensemble of objects, i.e. a composite object, in the vicinity  of the object 
plane,  F  is a sum of each constituent’s 2D-Fourier transform, each of which is centred 
about  the  origin  at  the  transfer  plane.    Application  of  a  2D-mask  determined  for  the 
constituent of interest 
0F , to the recorded hologram, e.g. implemented as a product of the 
mask  and  hologram,  followed  by  hologram  reconstruction,  will  predominantly  pick-up 
0F .  This property central 
those constituents whose Fourier transform is conformal with 
to the DFM merits will be further addressed in the experimental context of this paper.  
 
2.3 Contrast  
 
a. Analytical model 
 
DFM  can  offer  contrast  enhancement,  as  compared  to  conventional  bright-field 
microscopy.  Consider the bright-field microscopy and DFM principal configurations as 
shown  in  figures  2(a)  and  2(b),  respectively.    In  the  bright-field  microscopy,  an  object 
situated at the object plane is illuminated with a plane wave of power P and the image is 
recorded by a CCD camera placed at the image plane.  Specifically, the imaging system 
is  assumed  to  have  a  magnification  of  unity.    If  the  illumination  beam  could  then  be 
eliminated  from  the  detection  process,  as  in  case  of  the  dark-field  microscopy,  the 
intensity  distribution  at  the  CCD  sensor  would  directly  relate  to  the  object  function  f,

Otherwise,  the  illumination  beam  fills  the  entire  area  of  the  CCD  camera.    The  bright-

The visibility of small objects diminished due to the obscuring effects of large structures.  
In order to  model this typical imaging layout, we introduce a composite object discrete 
function, as a sum of two Gaussian discrete functions of broad and narrow widths:

following parameters into Eq. (5): M = N = 1024, αb = αn = 1, ∆b = 700, ∆n = 10.  The 
discrete object function profile taken along its radial line is plotted in figure 3(a), which 
also serves as a representation of the recorded bright-field image under assumption of the 
negligible contribution of the illumination background.  A 2D-bright-field image is also 
shown in figure 4(a).  Power spectrum amplitude of the bright-field profile is presented in 
figure 3(b).  This spectrum exhibits a large central peak associated with the broad object 
component,  and  weak  sidelobes.    The  contrast  of  the  desirable  narrow-width  signal  is 
estimated as a ratio of the total signal maximum to the mean signal background, i.e. CBF 
= 90/72 = 1.25.  
 
In  the  DFM  case  [see  figure  3(d)],  the  calculated  signal  profile  is  similar  to  the  power 
spectrum  amplitude  profile  of  the  bright-field  signal  [see  figure  3(b)],  but  bears  an 
important difference: the central peak amplitude is considerably lower.  To understand it, 
recall  that  the  small-angle  optical  scatter  is  tightly  localized  at  the  transfer  plane 
contributing  to  the  central  peak  amplitude,  as  shown  in  figure  3(b).    In  the  DFM  case,

though,  the  central  peak  is  clipped,  or  effectively  attenuated  with  respect  to  the  high 
spatial frequency components due to the CCD‘s saturation limit, whereas the wide-angle 
optical  scatter  is  unaffected.    When  the  DFM  radial  signal  profile  is  reconstructed  by 
performing  a  DFT  [figure  3(c)],  the  power  spectrum  amplitude  of  the  broad  object 
function, that represent the background, is greatly diminished, whereas the narrow object 
function remains unaltered.  The net result demonstrates the contrast enhancement of the 
small  objects  CDFM  =  25/3  =  8.3,  which  gives  a  contrast  improvement  of  6.7  in 
comparison with that of the bright-field microscopy.  
 
It is also worthwhile to compare image contrast achievable using DFM with another well-
known technique, dark-field microscopy.  In the dark-field microscopy, an intense central 
peak at the transfer plane due to the small-angle optical scatter is completely removed by 
placing a field stop [see figure 3(f)], on axis, in front of the CCD camera.  The profile of 
the simulated signal after removal of the central component at the transfer plane is shown 
in  figure  3(e).    However,  in  contrast  with  the  DFM,  the  dark-field  microscopy  signal 
exhibits  side-lobe  artefacts  due  to  the  rectangular  function  filter  response  of  the  beam 
stop.   
 
In  order  to  aid  visual  perception  of  our  results,  we  have  computed  and  plotted  pseudo 
colour images of the composite object obtained using: bright-field, DFM, and dark-field 
microscopy.  A bright-field image with a broad background component is shown in figure 
4(a).    A  dramatic  increase  in  image  contrast  can  be  seen  in  the  DFM  and  dark-field 
microscopy images shown in figures 4(b) and (c), respectively.  Although some artefacts 
are  introduced  in  DFM,  they  are  not  as  apparent  as  those  in  the  dark-field  microscopy. 
Furthermore,  sidelobes  in  DFM  can  be  removed  by  apodization,  which  is  considerably 
more difficult to implement in hardware, as in the case in the dark-field microscopy.  
 
3. Experiment 
 
We have carried out experimental investigation of the imaging performance of the DFM 
system  in  transmission  and  reflection-modes.    Two  schematic  diagrams  of  the  DFM 
transmission  and  reflection  experimental  systems  are  shown  in  figures  5(a)  and  (b), 
respectively.  Transmission-mode is commonly used for in vitro microscopic observation 
of  thin  biological  samples,  e.g.  cell  cultures,  while  reflection-mode  is  important  for 
imaging of relatively translucent thick samples, or, presumably, in vivo imaging of low-
scattering biological samples.  
 
In transmission-mode DFM, an optical output from a helium-neon laser ( l = 632.8 nm, P 
= 5 mW) was equally split into object and reference arms.  In the object arm, a sample 
was placed at the primary objective plane in the path of the collimated laser beam, where 
light was either scattered or transmitted through the sample.  An assembly of an infinity-
corrected objective lens Lobj (Olympus,  · 40, NA = 0.65), and a relay lens Lr (achromat-
doublet,  focal  length  fr  =  60 mm),  produced  a  magnified  image  of  the  object  at  the 
secondary object plane (see figure 5).  An aperture was placed at this plane to limit the 
field  of  view  of  the  overall  imaging  system,  and  in  order  to  avoid  aliasing  in  the 
reconstructed  image.    The  magnified  image  was  projected  onto  the  transfer  plane  by  a 

 

8 

J.Phys.D. 38 3590 (2004) 

Fourier  lens  LF  (achromat-doublet,  focal  length  fF  =  100 mm),  where  a  CCD  camera 
(Photometrics, CoolSNAP cf, 12-bit, 1392· 1040) was situated.  In the reference arm, the 
laser light  was coupled into a single-mode optical fibre (mode-field diameter  4.0 µm at 
632.8 nm, NA = 0.11).  The distal end of the fibre was placed off-axis at the object plane.  
The interference between the optical field due to the magnified image of the object and 
the quasi plane reference field combined at the transfer plane was recorded by the CCD 
camera.   
 
In  order  to  test  the  basic  performance  of  DFM,  as  applied  to  imaging  of  biological 
objects, we have fabricated a biological phantom.  To mimic cell nuclei suspension in the 
cytoplasm matrix, polystyrene spheres were embedded into the polyvinyl alcohol matrix 
(PVA).    The  spheres  were  provided  as  aqueous  suspensions  (ProSciTech,  5.0 %  w/v  in 
water).  0.5 and 2.0 mL of the 2- and 5- µm -diameter sphere suspensions were combined 
with 10 % w/v  PVA solutions in deionised water.  Thin solid films where made by spin 
coating this mixture onto quartz cover slips at 700 revolutions per minute for 10 seconds 
1.  As a result, a sample of well-separated non-aggregated sphere mixture was produced.  
The  polystyrene  spheres  relative  refractive  index  was  estimated  to  be  equal  to  1.05, 
which was very close to that of the typical cellular nuclei, i.e. 1.06.  A Fourier hologram 
of  this  sample  was  recorded  by  the  CCD  camera  using  exposure  time  of  1 ms  for  each 
image.    For  alignment  and  initial  observations,  RS  Image  software  by  Roper  Scientific 
was used to operate the camera, and display  captured images.  The digital  data transfer 
from  the  CCD  to  a  personal  computer  was  computer-controlled  from  the  LabVIEW 
platform.  Image processing, storage, and display were implemented in Matlab.   
 
The diagram of the DFM experimental setup in reflection-mode is shown in figure 5(b).  
This configuration is similar to that of the transmission-mode, except the direction of the 
illumination  beam  incidence  on  the  sample  is  reversed.    In  our  case,  the  illumination 
beam was, first, expanded by a telescope [not shown in figure 5(b)] and then introduced 
into the system via  a pellicle beamsplitter,  which was located between the object plane 
and  Lr.    This  configuration  ensured  that  a  beam  incident  on  the  sample  rendered 
collimated after passing the objective lens.  In reflection-mode, light backscattered from 
the object is collected via the same optical train as in transmission-mode.   
 
In order to carry out comparative study of imaging contrast of DFM versus bright-field 
microscopy, DFM was operated in reflection-mode.  The bright-field microscopy system 
was  reconfigured  from  the  DFM  system  by  increasing  the  separation  from  the  object 
plane  to  LF,  and  from  LF  to  the  CCD  camera,  from  fF  to  2fF,  such  that  an  image  was 
recorded directly onto the CCD, in similarity with the principal configuration shown in 
figure  2(b).    Equal  illumination  was  ensured  in  both  configurations.    The  illumination 
beam reflected from a sample interface served as a background optical field of the bright-
field microscopy system. 
 
4. Results 
 
Figure 7 present results of experimental observations of image  contrast enhancement of 
the  DFM  technique.    Images  obtained  using  DFM  and  bright-field  microscopy  systems 

 

9 

J.Phys.D. 38 3590 (2004) 

are  presented  in  figure  6(a)  and  (b),  respectively.    In  bright-field  microscopy,  gross 
morphology of the surrounding polyvinyl alcohol, is predominantly visible.  As a result, 
small  objects,  e.g.  2- µm   polystyrene  spheres,  are  largely  obscured.    This  effect  is 
considerably  improved  in  case  of  DFM.    For  example,  a  2- µm   sphere,  marked  by  an 
arrow A, not clearly observable on the bright background in the bright-field image [figure 
6(b)], is visible in the DFM image [figure 6(a)].  Also, three 2- µm  spheres, marked by an 
arrow B, appear to be well resolved in DFM [figure 6(a)], while their separate appearance 
is somewhat ambiguous in the bright-field microscopy.  Comparison of these two images 
shows  the  efficiency  of  DFM  for  image  contrast  enhancement,  as  applied  to  small-size 
objects. 
 
Next, we demonstrated the use of optical scatter for the DFM filtering.  A DFM  image 
captured in transmission-mode is shown in figure 7(a).  This image features a noticeable 
background on which 2- and 5- µm  polystyrene spheres are observed.  Slightly defocused 
appearance  of  these  spheres  (surrounded  by  rings)  is  attributed  to  the  deliberate 
defocusing  of  the  imaging  optics  in  order  to  reduce  the  blooming  effect  of  the  tightly 
focussed illumination beam on the CCD camera.   
 
In order to demonstrate the selective enhancement of a small object of interest, a suitable 
digital mask was required.  This pick up mask was designed by processing the recorded 
optical scatter signal of the selected object.  In our case, the optical scatter represented an 
envelope  of  the  Fourier  hologram  of  this  object.    In  order  to  obtain  this  envelope,  an 
individual  scatterer  of  e.g.  2- µm   in  diameter  was  cropped  out  from  the  reconstructed 
image,  for  example  a  sphere  marked  “2- µm ”  in  figure  7(a).    The  discrete  crop-out 
function  was  chosen  to  be  a  2D-Gaussian-shape  array  that  was  centred  at  the  selected 
sphere and padded with zeros elsewhere to eliminate contributions from the other objects.  
The product of the reconstructed image and crop-out function produced an image of the 
selected  sphere  and  its  vicinity  on  a  dark  background.    A  DFT  of  the  resultant  array 
followed by the envelope detection yielded the optical scatter of the selected sphere.  This 
mask  design  process  was  repeated  for  two  different  2-m m-spheres,  and  also  5- µm  
spheres.  Two envelopes of each size were averaged to produce masks for 2- and 5- µm  
spheres,  which  are  presented  in  figures  8(a)  and  (b),  respectively.    As  expected,  the 
optical  scatter  pattern  of  5- µm -sphere  exhibits  a  small  central  lobe  surrounded  by,  at 
least,  one  ring,  whereas  the  optical  scatter  of  2- µm   sphere  comprises  one  large-size 
central  lobe.    The  comparison  of  these  optical  scatters  with  optical  scatters  calculated 
using the Mie scattering theory has been reported to show reasonable agreement 1.  These 
optical  scatter  patterns  represent  the  basis  for  digital  mask  design  for  the  purpose  of 
Fourier filtering of an object of interest. 
 
An efficient method to discriminate an object of one kind (e.g. 5- µm  polystyrene sphere) 
in favour of an object of the other (e.g. 2- µm  polystyrene sphere) is to multiply the ratio 
of the two normalised optical scatters with the original hologram.  The ratio of the 2- µm  
to 5- µm  normalised optical scatters, a pick up mask, is shown in figure 8(c).  This mask 
takes  the  form  of  a  doughnut  and  features  a  high  attenuation  zone  at  the  centre  with  a 

 

10 

J.Phys.D. 38 3590 (2004) 

is  reconstructed, 

high transmission wing that fades off outwards of the mask.  This design picks up wide-
angle scatter contributions, which are pronounced in the case of 2- µm  spheres.  Most of 
the  signal  in  the  hologram  that  contributes  to  the  reconstruction  of  5- µm   spheres  is 
localized  in  the  high  attenuation  zone  of  the  pick-up  mask  and,  therefore,  this  signal  is 
suppressed, rendering the 5- µm  spheres with dim appearance.  When the product of the 
pick-up  mask  and  original  DFM  hologram 
the  predominant 
enhancement  of  the  2- µm   spheres  is  clearly  observable,  as  shown  in  figure  7(b).    The 
image background is also largely suppressed. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
As  we  have  demonstrated  in  the  preceding  sections,  DFM  is  not  only  capable  of 
producing images via DFT reconstruction, but is also capable of producing optical scatter 
imaging, providing extra information of sample properties.  For example, a small aperture 
and non-absorbing sphere of the same diameter would produce an almost identical image, 
although,  the  optical  scatter  would  be  different  for  these  two  objects.    Digital  Fourier 
microscopy is a suitable technique to pick up this difference.  Similarly, two equal-size 
spheres  of  different  refractive  indices  would  be  distinguished  using  DFM,  even  though 
their images should be identical.  It is important to point out that since DFM data is stored 
in  digital  format,  the  optical  scatter  can  be  retrieved  at  the  post-processing  stage.    This 
renders the technique as flexible, as to that of the previously reported (OSI) 4 in terms of 
the  optical  scatter  control  for  the  enhancement  of  features  of  interest.    Exploiting  the 
flexibility of digital filtering, differentiation between various objects of different optical 
form-factors  can  be  made  possible  using  DFM,  one  example  being  spherical  and 
spheroidal objects.  
 
It  is  worthwhile  to  comment  on  several  problems  of  DFM.    Since  the  core  recording 
configuration  of  DFM  is  Fourier  holography,  it  suffers  from  a  drawback  common  to 
Fourier  holography:  a  collimated  illumination  light  beam  in  the  object  arm  (as  well  as 
light scattered from large structures) is tightly focussed into an intense spot on the CCD 
camera.  This causes saturation of its several central pixels.  As a consequence, the CCD 
gain had to be adjusted to prevent photo-damage and blooming effects.  The sensitivity to 
detection of low-intensity  high-spatial frequency scatter due to small objects appears to 
be compromised.  In order to ameliorate these undesirable effects, a CCD camera can be 
slightly  displaced  from  the  transfer  plane,  so  that  the  illumination  light  is  no  longer 
tightly focused.  The sensitivity of DFM to small objects can, therefore, be considerably 
improved, at the expense of slight degradation of the lateral resolution of the system  15.  
In reflection-mode, the tight focussing effect is exacerbated by the presence of specular 
reflections  from  the  multiple  optical  elements  in  the  objective  lens  and,  also,  from  the 
air/sample  interface.    Even  though  a  specular  reflection  from  each  interface  represents 
only several per cent of the total incident optical power, the backscatter efficiency is also 
reduced (several orders of magnitude for micron-size sphere of relative refractive index 
of 1.06, as a nucleus in cytoplasm), as compared to that of the forward scatter.  Therefore, 
prevention  of  the  tight  focussing  on  the  CCD  camera  presents  a  problem  in  DFM,  and 
warrants further study.   
 

 

11 

J.Phys.D. 38 3590 (2004) 

There is an ample scope for further improvement of the DFM performance.  First of all, 
the  optical  train  of  elements  following  the  objective  lens  was  not  optimized,  and  it 
accounted for the suboptimal image quality presented in this paper.  Secondly, a number 
of optical elements of conventional surface quality and cleanliness inevitably resulted to 
the  excess  noise  in  the  recorded  holograms.    The  incoherent  contribution  to  the  noisy 
background  of  the  recorded  hologram  can  be  compensated  by  employing  the  phase 
shifting  methods  17.    Imaging  of  highly  scattering  samples  is  expected  to  present  a 
problem  for  DFM,  since  a  high-coherence  illumination  source  is  employed  in  this 
technique.    A  parasitic  interference  originated  from  the  multiple-scattering  within  these 
samples will degrade the reconstructed image quality significantly.  
 
To  illustrate  the  significance  of  the  reported  DFM  technique,  consider  recording  of  the 
Fourier  hologram  of  the  cell  culture  conventionally  modelled  as  a  set  of  nuclei 
(spheroids)  embedded  in  the  lower  refractive  index  cytoplasm.    It  is  expected  that 
adaptive digital filtering followed by digital image reconstruction enhances spheroids that 
match the pre-selected parameters of the digital mask, with the most important parameter 
being spheroid size.  The application  of a set of  digital  masks  computed  for a range of 
spheroid  sizes  can  potentially  yield  the  size  distribution  of  the  cell  nuclei,  which  will 
serve as the key diagnostic discriminate of, for example, cancer 18. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, we have reported on advances in digital Fourier microscopy, a holographic 
implementation  of  the  optical  scatter  imaging.    This  DFM  approach  is  based  on  the 
application  of  digital  Fourier  holography  to  recording  of  comprehensive  information  of 
the  object,  including  optical  scatter  of  the  object  constituents.    This  approach  confers 
several merits, as compared to optical scatter imaging implemented in hardware: objects 
of interest have been demonstrated to be enhanced by applying digital filtering to Fourier 
holograms  recorded  using  DFM.    Contrast  of  small-size  features  on  the  slowly-varying 
background  has  been  demonstrated  theoretically  and  experimentally  to  be  enhanced,  in 
similarity with the dark-field microscopy.  We believe that DFM is particularly suitable 
for in vitro applications for imaging of thin biological objects, as it provides an efficient 
discrimination mechanism for biological constituents of interest.

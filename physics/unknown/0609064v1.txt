INTRODUCTION 

 
Problem of Phase Transition (PT) in Strongly Coupled Coulomb Systems (SCCS) is of 
great interest in plasma theory during very long time1-5. Besides the study of hypothetical 
PT in real plasmas1-3 a complementary approach is developing4,5 where the main subject of 
interest is definitely existing PT in simplified plasma models. In our previous study6-8 we 
dealt  with  a  phase  transition  in  the  set  of  plasma  models  with  common  feature  - 
combination  of  (i)  absence  of  individual  correlations  (coupling)  between  charges  of 
opposite  sign,  and  (ii)  total  compressibility  of  system.  The  simplest  example  of  such  a 
system  is  One  Component  Plasma  (OCP)  on  uniform,  but  compressible  compensating 
background (following notation - OCP{c}). The well-known prototype model is OCP with 
a  rigid  background  (notation  -  OCP{r}).  This  variant  of  OCP  is  studied  carefully 
nowadays9,10.  It  can  not  collapse  or  explode  spontaneously.  The  only  phase  transition  - 
crystallisation - occurs in OCP{r} without any density change.  

Transition to the OCP on uniform and compressible background leads to appearance of 
a  new  first-order  phase  transition  of  gas-liquid  type6.  New  phase  diagram  combines 
previous  crystallisation,  now  with  a  finite  density  change,  with  a  qualitatively  different 
coexistence curve of the new phase transition. The structure and parameters of this phase 
diagram strongly depend on exact definition of thermodynamic contribution of background. 
The simplest variant of OCP{r} is the «Single OCP» - the system of classical point charges 
with a compressible background of ideal fermi-gas of electrons. This variant of OCP was 
declared repeatedly11,12 but the discussed phase transition was out of consideration. Closely 
similar  structure  of  global  phase  diagram  was  obtained  in  «Combined  OCP»6-8.  This  is 
superposition  of  two  non-coupled  OCP-s  of  mass-non-symmetrical  charged  particles  of 
opposite sign.  

PHASE DIAGRAM OF SINGLE OCP{c} 

Three qualitatively different situations should be distinguished for the OCP{c} 

depending on the value of charge number Z: 
-     Z < Z1* ≈ 35 
1) Low value of charge number   
2) High value of charge number   
-     Z > Z2* ≈ 45 
3) Intermediate value of charge number  -     Z1* < Z < Z2*

Low Values of Charge Number (Z ~ 1) 

Phase  diagram  of  the  model  was  carefully  studied  in6-8.  The  ordinary  structure  of 
global  phase  diagram  was  obtained  in  this  case:  the  relative  position  of  critical  and  triple 
points,  melting  «stripe»,  gas-liquid  and  gas-crystal  coexistence,  are  totally  equivalent  to 
those for normal substances. 

High Values of Charge Number (Z ~ 100). 

Highly  anomalous  structure  of  global  phase  diagram  was  announced  at  previous 
study6,7.  The  melting  «stripe»  (Г  ≈  178)  crosses  gaseous  part  of  coexistence  curve  of  the 
new phase transition. 

•  Triple point is placed at gaseous part of global phase boundary. 
•  Critical point is placed at crystalline part of global phase boundary. 
•  Crystal-crystal coexistence of two dense and expanded crystalline phases of the same 

structure occurs in OCP{r} at such a high values of charge number Z. 

Intermediate Values of Charge Number (Z1* < Z < Z2*) 

The  most  remarkable  anomalous  phase  diagram  corresponds  to  the  case  when  the 
melting  line  of  prototype  OCP{r}  (Г  ~  Гmelt  ≈  178)  crosses  coexistence  curve  of  the  new 
gas-liquid phase transition just closely to its critical point. As a result of this coincidence: 

•  The only phase transition exists in the model. It corresponds to the global crystal - fluid 

coexistence − continuous superposition of melting and sublimation (see Figure 1). 

•  There is no true critical point. 
•  There is no triple point. 

 

 

 

•  Coexistence curve in P↔T (pressure↔temperature) plane is a continuous, infinite 

curve. There is no any break at this curve. 
 

Boundary Values of Intermediate Charge Number Interval (Z1* < Z < Z2*) 

Remarkable feature of phase diagram of OCP{c} at Z = Z1* or Z = Z2* is an existence 

of pseudo-critical point where the well-known standard conditions are fulfilled:  

 
(∂P/∂V) T = 0        (∂2P/∂V 2) T = 0 
 

Z = Z1* ≈ 34.6*  –  on gaseous part of crystal-fluid binodal (see Figure 2) 
Z = Z2* ≈ 45.4*  –  on crystalline part of crystal-fluid binodal. 

 
When  we  use  the  same  as  in6-8  analytical  fits  for  equation  of  state  of  both  subsystems, 
OCP{r}  and  background,  we  obtain  following  parameters  of  the  both  pseudo-critical 
points:

CRITICAL EXPONENTS 

Remarkable feature of two discussed pseudo-critical points at Z = Z1*or Z = Z2* is the 
non-standard  values  of  all  critical  exponents  in  comparison  with  the  ordinary  (van  der 
Waals  like)  critical  exponents  that  correspond  to  the  case  of  OCP{c}  with  the  charge 
number Z beyond the discussed interval Z1* ÷ Z2*. For example, at the latter case (Z < Z1* 
or Z > Z2*), the standard density↔temperature relation is valid 

 
(ρ - ρC) ~|T - TC|1/2 
 
For the pseudo-critical points (Z = Z1*  or  Z = Z2*) the following relation may be proved: 
 
(ρ - ρC) ~ |T - TC|1/3 

Direct calculation gives: 

|ρ/ρC - 1|  ≅  4.57 |T/TC - 1|1/2 
|ρ/ρC - 1|  ≅  4.07 |T/TC - 1|1/3 

 
 

SATURATION CURVE 

 
(Z = 1) 
(Z = Z1* ≅ 34.6) 
 

 
Similar violation is observed for saturation (PSt ↔ TSt) curve. So-called Plank − Gibbs 
rule (equal slope of saturation curve at T = TC - ε and critical isohore at T = TC + ε) is valid 
for an ordinary critical point (Z < Z1* or Z > Z2*), 

 
(dP/dT)St  =  (∂P/∂T)Vc  
 

It is not evident (see Figure 3), but it can be proved that this rule is not valid for pseudo-
critical points (Z = Z1*  or  Z = Z2*).

point  charges  with  uniform  compressible  background  of  ideal  fermi-gas  of  electrons  at  boundary 
value of charge number Z = Z1*≅ 34.6. Notations: 1- sublimation; 2 - melting; 3 - pseudo-critical 
«termination» point; 4 - critical isochore; 5,6 - sub-critical isochors. 
Figure 4. The same as on Figure 3 in Log↔Log - coordinates. Notations: 1-4 - as on Figure 1. 
 
This statement is illustrated on Figure 4. Small deviation in position of binodal (curves 1,2) 
and  critical  isochore  (curve  4)  corresponds  to  the  small  difference  in  slope  of  both  the 
curves at pseudo-critical point (Figure 3).

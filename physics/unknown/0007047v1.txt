interactions (2) applies to 4-fermion complexes in (1), not to
the threshold 2-fermion systems. But, unlike in Ps2, rotation
has a different effect on energy than inversion of charges if
cM and cC do not coincide, as in HH [3]. In cold atom region
R/Re  =  20,  difference  is  0.01  cm-1  in  favor  of  a  charge-
inverted state [3]. Matter/antimatter pair HH in (1a) can also
be  "matter"  with  not  too  short  a  lifetime  [1].  This  might
explain finally why an HH-PEC matches the observed H2-
PEC  [3].  Chemical  gaps  a 2µc2,  Coulomb  thresholds  e2/Re
for  mass  asymmetrical  charge-conjugated  ion  pairs  X+X-,
are 10-7 times annihilation gaps mXc2 [3].

The 4 different particles p, p, e and e in HH secure its cM
is prochiral,  which  explains  generically  why  chirality/left-
right  asymmetry  is  so  important  when  complex  matter  is
formed from diatomic bonds (bio-molecules, DNA...). With
H,  this  2nd  order  stereo-directing  effect  can  only  show  in
intermolecular HH ("H2") reactions leading to liquid, solid
and, eventually, metallic hydrogen.

Nature  prefers  unconventional  charge  distributions  in
N=4  neutral  positive  mass  systems,  which  result  in  anti-
symmetric  matter/antimatter  interactions  in  a  generic  way
and, finally, in stable "matter" [3]. More [3,4] or less [1,2]
stable micro-scale antimatter-domains exist close to matter-
domains. The universe consists mainly of hydrogen. Stable
micro-scale "matter" HH  gives  matter/antimatter  symmetry
for the universe on the macro-scale [3]. This avoids having
to look for large-scale antimatter-domains at large distances
(Mpc) from matter-domains [6] to conserve this symmetry.

Comment on "Hydrogen-Antihydrogen Collisions"

Froelich et al. found [1] that HH, like an  atomcule [2], can
survive  longer  than  expected.  Unfortunately,  they  did  not
calculate the PEC (potential energy curve) of intermediate
4-fermion complex HH,  which  is  very  close  to  that  of  H2
[3]. This places constraints on matter/antimatter reactions in
general and on HH in (1a) in particular. A perfect Babel of
tongues on conventional "matter" results when considering
matter/antimatter reactions like

CP-symmetries  in  neutral  N-particle  systems  (N=2,3,4),
with centers of mass cM and of charges cC, illustrate this:

(i) N=2; short living (10-12 sec) charge-conjugated pairs
Px  (positronium  Ps,  protonium  Pn);  cM  and  cC  coincide.
Pseudo atom Ps is stable, energy and spectrum derive from
Bohr theory. Ps belongs to the "matter" domain, although it
consists of equal amounts of matter and antimatter (e;e). By
symmetry, Ps may be classified as antimatter. But if Ps is
"matter",  antipositronium  Ps  is  "antimatter"  (see  below).
Mass-asymmetrical pairs (p;e in H, p;e in H) are stable.

(ii) N=3; charge-conjugated pairs in atomcules; cM near
cC. Antiprotonic helium He+p has a lifetime of µsec, longer
than Ps. It is new "matter" [2]. Antiparticle He-p is not (yet)
observed. In (i)-(ii), "matter" is a matter/antimatter pair.

(iii) N=4; atom/antiatom pairs as in (1); cM and cC do not
coincide. Molecules XX, if stable, are "matter" and building
blocks are matter/antimatter pairs. C-symmetry in atom and
antiatom  is  broken  by  lepton/nucleon  mass  difference.
Annihilation is hampered and lifetimes may equal or exceed
that in (ii). Even mass symmetrical N=4 systems like Ps2 in
(1b) are believed to be stable [4] (see also below).

If, in reality, "matter" consists of matter/antimatter pairs,
this leads to confusion. Neutrality requires 1/1 contributions
in terms of charges not of masses. Short lifetimes apply if
N=2 and cM coincides with cC. But simply rotating Ps gives
Ps due to mass symmetry. Comparing all forms as in (1c)

Internal C-symmetry in Ps2  becomes  a  P-symmetry  effect,
PsPs. By mirror-symmetry and with respect to the PsPs-cM,
Ps is left- PsL and  Ps right-handed PsR (or  vice  versa).  As
with Ps, PsPs is either matter or antimatter. Is it also stable
"matter"? If R separates the centers of mass (or charge) and
if a is the Ps-radius, interactions V(R) in (1c) for R >> a are

Operator p in 4-fermion Hamiltonians leads generically
to singlet-triplet splitting [3]. The drastic effect of Coulomb

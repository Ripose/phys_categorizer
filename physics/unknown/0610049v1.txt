Abstract. We begin with a scenario that involves point-like observers starting at t=0 from 
the  origin  O  of  an  inertial  reference  frame.  They  move  with  all  possible  proper 
accelerations  (0<g< ∞ )  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  OX  axis.  Equipped  with  light 
sources the accelerating observers get involved in experiments like Doppler Effect, radar 
detection and radar echo. We derive formulas accounting for the experiments mentioned 
above. In the case of the Doppler Effect we take into account the non-locality aspect in 
the time interval measurement by accelerating observers.  
 
1. Introduction 
The  fundamental  problem  of  special  relativity  can  be  stated  as  follows:  point-like 
observers  start  moving  from  the  same  point  in  space,  at  the  same  time  and  in  the  same 
direction with all possible constant speeds (V<c). Find out the relationships between the 
results  they  obtain  when  performing  measurements  on  the  same  physical  object. 
Changing  this  scenario,  we  propose  the  following  problem:  Point-like  observers  who 
are able to communicate with each other using light signals start from rest state and 
from  the  same  point  in  space  and  move  in  the  same  direction  with  all  possible 
proper accelerations g (0<g< ∞ ). Find out the relationships between the results they 
obtain when performing measurements on the same physical object. 
Let  R0(0,0)  be  a  particular  observer  located  at  the  origin  O  of  its  rest  inertial  reference 
frame  K(XOY). 
  is  an  observer  who,  relative  to  the  K(XOY)  frame,  performs  a 
hyperbolic motion characterized by a constant proper acceleration g that begins at a time 
t=0    from  the  origin  O  with  zero  initial  velocity.  The  space  coordinate  of  an  event 
generated by R’(g), attributed by R0(0,0) is

We say that observers 
in  the  positive  direction  of  the  OX  axis  of  the  stationary  reference  frame  K(XOY) 
make  up  a  system  of  uniformly  accelerating  observers.  We  should  not  confound  it 
with the uniformly accelerating reference frame2,3 which involves different uniformly 
accelerating observers who start with zero initial velocity at t=0 from different points of

We  present  there  the  asymptotes  of  the  world  lines  as  well.  Equipped  with  clocks  and 
light sources the accelerating observers get involved with each other in experiments like 
Doppler Effect, radar detection and radar echo4. They are also involved in the same 
experiments  with  a  stationary  observer  R0(0,0)  who  handles  the  light  source  S0(0,0) 
located in front of him. As we see from Figure 1: 

-  An  accelerating  observer 

  receives  all  the  light  signals  emitted  by  the 
source S0(0,0) in the time interval  t < c/gi, t representing the time displayed by 
the wrist watch C0(0,0) of the stationary observer R0(0,0).

The  peculiarities  of  the  exchange  of  information  via  light  signals,  between  the 
 
observers  mentioned  above,  are  generated  by  the  fact  that  after  a  very  long  time  of 
motion theirs velocities tend to infinity without reaching it. 
 
2. The Doppler Effect in the system of uniformly accelerating observers 
 
2.1. Stationary source of light and accelerating receiver 
Consider that observer R0(0,0) emits successive light signals at constant time intervals Te. 
Let  NTe  be  the  time  when  the  Nth  light  signal  is  emitted  (N=0,1,2…)  the  accelerating 
observer 

 receiving them.

observer receives them respectively. Intersecting the world line of the first observer with

Deriving (9) we have taken into account what physicists call “non-locality in the period 
measurement  by  accelerating  observers”5  i.e.  the  fact  that  the  moving  observer 
receives the successive light signals from two different points in space and that during the 
time interval that separates the two events the velocity of the receiver changes. 
Cochran6 in his approach to this experiment doesn’t take into account the non-locality. He 
starts  directly  with  the  formula  that  accounts  for  the  longitudinal  Doppler  Effect  with 
light signals

  when  the 
replacing  V  with  its  instantaneous  magnitude  expressed  as  a  function  of

Equations (9) and (12) enable us to evaluate the error committed when ignoring the non-

The frequencies in all the experiments we describe can change in a very large range of 
values  because  by  modulation  we  can  transmit  very  small  frequencies  (acoustic 
frequencies)  but  also  very  large  ones  (radio  frequencies).  Low  frequencies  favour  the 
non-locality whereas the high ones favour the locality. As a consequence we get:

As  this  graph  reveals,  the  approximation  error  decreases  with  N  and  Te  and  reaches  0 
when Te approaches 0. For N = 0 this error is not yet zero but depends on Te. 

 

2.2. Doppler Effect with stationary receiver and accelerating source of light 
In  order  to  illustrate  the  asymmetry  of  the  problem  under  study  we  consider  that  the 
  the  stationary  observer 
source  of  light  is  attached  to  the  accelerating  observer 
R0(0,0) receiving them Figure 4.

Similar to Cochran’s approach we ignore the non-locality by replacing in (11) the 
non-constant velocity V with its instantaneous value at time when the accelerating source 
emits the Nth light signal. Expressing V as a function of emission time we obtain:

The approximation error decreases with  N and Te and reaches 0 when Te approaches 0. 
For N = 0 this error is not yet zero but depends on Te. It is also interesting to notice that 
the maximum error is limited to 100% in this case.

The  graphical  representation  below  (Figure  7) shows  that  this  Doppler  factor  decreases 
with the order number N and the relative acceleration ratio g2/g1. This behaviour can be 
easily deduced from figure 6 were we notice that, because of the hyperbolic motion, even 
for shorter emission periods the reception periods rapidly increases with N.

The  graphical  representation  of  the  Doppler  factor  in  this  case  reveals  that  it  quickly 
converges toward the final value g1/g2 as N increases (Figure 9). A closer look at Figure 8 
allows for a easier understanding of this effect. For large emission times the world lines 
of the two observers become parallel and thus the difference between the emission and 
reception periods remains about the same. As expected we reach this convergence faster 
with longer emission periods.

The equations that account for the radar echo derived above hold only in the case of very 
high frequencies (locality assumption). It is very interesting to notice in figures 14 and 15 
that  the  Doppler  factor  for  both  radar  echo  scenarios  analysed  above  is  always  smaller 
than  1.  It  means  that  the  reception  period  is  always  longer  than  the  emission  period, 
independent on which observer accelerates faster or performs the radar experiment. This 
effect may be better understood by a closer look at figures 6 and 8. It appears very clear 
that  because  of  the  hyperbolic  motion  we  witness  a  significant  period  dilation  effect 
1R′   toward 
accumulated  during  the  time  when  the  light  signal  proceeds  from  observer

5. Conclusions 
We considered a scenario involving observers performing the hyperbolic motion 
 
with all possible proper accelerations 0< g<  ∞ . This enabled us to reveal the peculiarities 
of  the  experiments  these  observers  perform  involving  information  exchange  via  light 
signals they emit and receive. The problem has not only an academic interest, the results 
obtained being of interest also for the pilots of high-speed airplanes.

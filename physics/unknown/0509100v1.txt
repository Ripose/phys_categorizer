ABSTRACT: 
Many  biological  tissues,  such  as  bones  and  ligaments,  are  fibrous.  The  geometrical 
structure of these tissues shows that they exhibit a similar hierarchy in their ultra-structure 
and  macro-structure.  The  aim  of  this  work  is  to  develop  a  model  to  study  the  failure  of 
fibrous structures subjected to dynamic loading. The important feature of this model is that 
it describes failure in terms of the loss of cohesion between fibres. We have developed a 
model based on the lamellar structure of compact bone with fibres oriented at 0°, 45° and 
90°  to  the  longitudinal  axis  of  the  bone,  and  have  studied  the  influence  of  the  model 
parameters on the failure process. Bone porosity and joint stress force at failure were found 
to  be  the  most  significant  parameters.  Using  least  square  resolution,  we  deduced  a 
phenomenological  model  of  the  lamellar  structure.  Finally,  experimental  results  were 
found to be comparable with our numerical model.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Biological materials such as bones and ligaments are fibrous structures. When considering 
trauma which occur accidentally or during sports, the fibrous structures of cortical bones 
are  exposed  to  dynamic  tearing,  damage  and  failure  mechanisms  which  are  induced  by 
shocks. Quite a lot of research has been carried out on the mechanical behaviour of hard 
and soft tissues when exposed to quasi-static forces, but the damage and failure caused by 
dynamic  loading  has  not  drawn  the  attention  of  many  authors.  A  few  have  carried  out 
experiments  using  micro-macro  techniques.  We  can  refer  to  the  homogenisation  method 
developed  by  (5),  and  the  thermodynamic  approach  proposed  by  (3).  Other  authors  have 
focused their work on the study of the mechanical behaviour of bone microstructure (1, 2, 
6, 8, 14, 20, 21, 24, 25). These models cannot however be used to study bone failure. The 
aim of this work is to develop a specific model to study the behaviour of fibrous structures 
subject  to  dynamic  forces  until  failure.  We  assume  that  the  failure  of  such  materials  is 
caused  by  the  loss  of  cohesion  between  fibres.  These  fibres  are  considered  to  be  the 
elementary  structural  components  with  the  lowest  failure  characteristic.  Failure  does  not 
generally occur in such materials as a result of the fibres breaking, but rather because they 
lose  their  structural  stability  in  an  avalanche  process  of  cohesive  failure.  We  established 
this model by considering longitudinal as well as transversal joints between fibres. We then 
used a multi-scale method to deal with the various hierarchical levels of the structure. The 
purpose of this study is to show that numerical experiments, using a model of the cohesive

composite material comprising elastic fibres, may help to understand the brittle behaviour 
of these tissues when they are subjected to dynamic tensile loading. Our approach is based 
on the finite element model described below, where the behaviour of the joints between the 
elastic  fibres  constituting  the  model  are  described  by  unilateral  contact,  friction  and 
cohesive  laws  (12,  13).  Since  many  of  parameters  in  this  model  (e.g.  structure 
heterogeneity, porosity, geometry, etc.) can influence the failure behaviour, we analysed a 
number  of  parameters  to  identify  which  ones  have  the  greatest  influence  on  failure  of 
compact bones. This led us to propose laws concerning the structural constitution including 
these parameters. Finally, we compared our numerical results with experimental tests. 
 
I. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF BONES 
 
A general overview of the specific nature of the hierarchical structure of bone is helpful in 
understanding why we wanted to develop this fibrous model. 
The constitution and geometric structure of bones are highly complex (7, 26). This means 
that they can be considered as a composite material. From a geometrical point of view at 
the  lamellar  level,  the  structural  pattern  of  bones  shows  strong  similarities  with 
tropocollagen  (24,  25)  (Figure  1).  The  main  deformation  mechanisms  can  occur  at  five 
different levels: 
 

0
-  In  the  tropocollagen  molecule  and  the  microfibril  (length  =  2800
A ),  elongation 
mechanisms  set  the  molecule  profile  (2,  18,  24,  25).  The  authors  (4,  17)  have  proposed 
mechanical models based on the waviness of the microfibrils. At this level, the microfibrils 
were found to be elastic (10, 19, 20, 23). 
 
-  In  the  fibrils  (length  =  10  m m  to  100  m m),  the  arrangement  of  overlapping  and  gap 
regions  has  been  described  on  the  basis  of  the  Hodge  Petruska  model  (11,  24,  25).  The 
joints  in  the  bone  structure  consist  of  a  mineral  hydroxyapatite  component  shown  to 
exhibit elastoplastic behaviour (9, 14, 15, 24, 25). 
 
-  The  fibre  is  a  geometrical  assembly  of  disjointed  fibrils  embedded  in  an  amorphous 
substance. When fibres are loaded, the pressure applied causes fluid to be exuded from the 
tissue, as the result of which the material exhibits viscous behaviour (16). 
 
-  The  fibre-lamella  assembly  is  made  up  of  fibres  which  are  all  oriented  in  the  same 
direction.  There  are  several  different  kinds  of  lamellae,  oriented  longitudinally, 
transversally and obliquely, i.e. forming an angle of 0°, 45° and 90° with the longitudinal 
axis of the structure. 
 
- The lamella-osteonal and osteonal-bone assembly cannot be precisely described in terms 
of fibre interactions.  
 
II FIBROUS MODEL AND EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 
 
Our model is based on the biological fibrous structure, and the failure process is assumed 
to  be  caused  by  successive  cohesive  failure  events  occurring  at  different  scales  and 
aggregating  so  as  to  generate  micro-voids  or  micro-cracks,  that  well  up  into  aggregates 

 

3

generating voids or cracks on a larger scale. These processes could be studied statistically. 
There  remains  the  possibility  of  exploring  an  assembly  of  model-fibres  linked  together 
with appropriately distributed cohesive forces. Given the fibrous structure of the model, the 
ability to bear tensile stress results from two classes of cohesive forces. These are: (i) the 
fore  end  of  each  fibre  on  the  aft  end  of  the  previous  fibre  (head  to  tail  or  longitudinal 
cohesive  force);  and  (ii)  the  flanks  of  neighbouring  fibres  (flank  to  flank  or  transversal 
cohesive  force).  The  principal  component  of  the  head  to  tail  forces  is  tensile,  while  the 
principal component of the flank to flank forces is a shear force. In this study, tensile tests 
in the direction of the fibres were taken into account. The constitutive laws were therefore 
developed from a fibrous model subjected to tensile traction applied in the direction of the 
fibre axes (this model could be a lamellar structure). Because of the dynamic kinematics 
involved,  damage  was  assumed  to  be  preponderant,  and  viscosity  was  neglected.  The 
following fibrous model (cf. Figure 2.a) consists of an assembly of fibres, in which joints 
are formed longitudinally and transversally between the fibres (cf. Figure 2.a and 2.b).  
 
II.1. The Joint Model 
 
In this model, interactions between fibres are described using unilateral contact conditions 
and Coulomb’s friction coefficient. Let n be the normal unit vector to the contact interface. 
The  normal  relative  displacement  between  two  contacting  fibres  is  then  defined  by  qN  = 
q.n.  decomposing  the  contact  force  vector  R  into  the  normal  (RN)  and  tangential  (RT) 
components gives: R = RN.n+ RT. 
 
In  the  cohesive  model,  the  unilateral  constraints  (Signorini  conditions)  are  written  as 
follows (1):  

qN ‡

 0, RN + l ‡ 0, (qN, RN+ l ) = 0 

(1) 

 (RN+l) [ 

where l is the longitudinal cohesive threshold. 
The  joint  model  characterises  a  cohesive  Mohr  Coulomb  law  (cf.  Figure  3.a)  which 
corresponds to a translation of the Coulomb cone.  
The corresponding law for friction with adhesion in terms of the threshold µl is given by 
relations 2.a, 2.b and 2.c:  
]-m
UT=0         ⇒RT˛
UT<0         ⇒RT = -m
UT>0         ⇒RT = m
Where m
This cohesive law can result in two possible situations occurring at the contact interfaces:  
If  (RN,  RT)  lies  inside  the  Coulomb  cone  (point  A  in  Figure  3.a  for  example)  the 
(i) 
fibres stick together and there is no relative displacement 
If  (RN,  RT)  lies  on  the  cone  boundary  (point  C  for  example  in  Figure  3.a),  the 
cohesive status is lost and friction occurs between the fibres, which corresponds to 
local damage (i. e. the joints between the fibre components are broken) 

l is the transversal cohesive breakdown threshold.

The static sliding coefficient µ is defined by µ = tga
The cohesive thresholds differ between longitudinal (f1) and transversal (f2) joints and are 
related to maximal head to tail and flank to flank cohesive forces (Figure 3.b).  
 
When  the  joints  are  broken,  the  classical  unilateral  Signorini  conditions  (3)  involving 
Coulomb’s friction (4.a, 4.b and 4.c) give:  
qN‡ 0 ; RN‡ 0; (qN,RN)=0

where UT is the sliding celerity and µf is the Coulomb’s friction coefficient. 
 
In order to account for the heterogeneity of the material, we applied a stochastic process to 
choose  the  cohesive  thresholds  for  the  model.  This  introduced  local  defects  into  the 
structure. 
 
II.2 Dynamic Equation and Boundary Conditions  
 
Assuming  the fibres exhibit elastic behaviour, the principle of virtual power was used to 
obtain the dynamic equation, the discrete form of which leads to the following system:

The boundary conditions must account for the behaviour of the surrounding material. On 
the  lateral  sides,  the  displacements  were  taken  to  be  zero  for  all  left-hand  side  nodes 
(Ux=0)  (Figure  4).  Though  several  different  boundary  conditions  may  be  applied  to  the 
upper and lower sides, they were chosen to specify s yy = 0 and identical displacements in 
the  y  displacements  of  the  upper  and  lower  sides  (

II.3 Finite Element Modelling 
 
To analyse the development of failure in structural bone tissue, the elementary volume was 
chosen to represent the length of a lamella. This study can also be applied to a microfibril, 
a  fibril  or  a  fibre.  A  representative  volume  was  obtained  by  assembling  21  fibres 
longitudinally  in  30  successive  layers.  To  study  the effect of the geometrical pattern, we 
also considered a structure constituted from the same number of fibres but made with 90 
successive layers of 7 longitudinal fibres each. We also studied the effect of the geometry 
by  doubling  the  number  of  fibres,  modelling  42  fibres  longitudinally  in  60  successive 
layers.  With  the  cohesive  model,  each  fibre  was  represented  by  a  2D  elastic  model-fibre 
(Figure  5).  Each  model-fibre  was  composed  of  eight  T3-triangle  linear  finite  elements 
(Figure 5). Cohesive frictional contact forces were exerted between model-fibres and, for 
numerical  purposes,  were  assumed  to  be  concentrated  at  specific  midpoints  (denoted  in 
figure 5 by tiny circles). Three types of lamellar structure in compact bone were simulated, 
with fibres oriented longitudinally, obliquely and transversally; i.e. at 0°, 45° and 90° with 
respect to the longitudinal axis of the structure. 
Several  authors  (1,  6,  8,  14,  19,  20,  23,  24)  have measured and analysed the mechanical 
properties of collagen and hydroxyapatite (Young’s modulus, Poisson's ratio and density). 
In  accordance  with  these  works,  the  fibres  were  assumed  to  be  elastic  with  a  Young's 
modulus E between 11GPa and 16GPa. The Young's modulus considered was an average 
of  the  collagen  and  hydroxyapatite  modulus  because  in  our  model-fibre  the  mineral  and 
collagen components were considered as a single equivalent material. The density d of the 
fibres was 2 103Kg/m3 and the Poisson ratio n
 was 0.33. The cohesive forces of the joints 
correspond to the plasticity values of the hydroxyapatite mineral. 
f1  is  taken  to  be  the  cohesive  head-tail  stress  for  each  layer  and  f2  the  cohesive  shearing 
stress for each layer interface (Figure 6). In order to compare different responses obtained 
with a number of values of the ratio f1/f2 with a given global failure threshold, the resulting 
force fres, was defined from: 
fres = (N-2) f1 + 2 f¶ 1+(N-1) f2  
with f¶ 1 the head tail force of the boundary fibres and N the number of layers 

(13)

For  the  above  relations,  it  was  assumed  that  the  boundary  fibres  are  subjected  to  shear 
cohesive forces exerted by the neighbouring material equal to f2. For the sake of simplicity 
and  numerical  processing,  this  force  was  included  in  the  head  tail  force  of  the  boundary 
fibres f¶ 1 so that f¶ 1= f1 + f2.  
We obtain: 
fres = N f1 + (N+1) f2 
(14) 
Considering  the  height  l  and  the  length  L  of  the  fibrous  structure  (a  unit  value  being 
assumed for thickness), the above formula can be written:

Since  f1  and  f2  cannot  exceed  the  maximum  values  of  the  cohesive  threshold,  the  above 
formula (16) shows clearly that the stress-strain response curve depends on the f1/f2 ratio. 
If  threshold  values  are  measured  as  stresses,  the  ratio  s 1/s 2  becomes  a  significant 
parameter together with the aspect ratio L/l. 
 
II.4 Experimental Tensile Method 
 
We assume that the most relevant parameters relating to the failure of compact bones need 
to  be  studied  at  the  microstructure  level.  Using  an  X-ray  scanner  and  a  microscope,  we 
analyse the sample density and porosity of the structure. We use an X-ray scanner ND8000 
of  the  Laboratoire  de  Mécanique  et  d’Acoustique  (Desrues  J.,  et  al.,  [1996],  Bonnenfant 
D.,  et  al.  [1998]).  X-ray  scanner  images  were  recorded  on  different  sections  of  the  bone 
samples. Sections were taken every 10 mm on a sample 110 mm long. 
We then analyse precisely the density variations in the section where the density was found 
to  vary  slightly  through  the  lamellar  structure  of  all  the  bones  studied  (around  1.9  103 
kg/m3).  In  the  osteonal  structure,  the  density  varies  between  1.8  103  kg/m3  and  2.1  103 
kg/m3. In parallel, a microscope was used to analyse the porosity of the bone structure. 
 
Samples  were  taken  from  ten  fresh  bovine  femoral  bones.  Two  samples  from  each  bone 
were cut in areas where the density varied slightly (around 1.9 103 kg/m3) in the anterior 
lateral and anterior medial. These samples have a lamellar structure. Tensile experiments 
were  developed  using  an  INSTRON  machine  (figure  7)  used  at  various  velocities  (0.5 
mm/min to 50 mm/min) with 500 kg tensile force (21). Human femoral bones were used to 
make samples. 
 
The epiphyses were cut so as to focus only on compact bone. Test-pieces were obtained by 
first  cutting  the  bones  in  the  axial  direction  and  then  removing  the  marrow  from  each 
specimen.  Samples  were  then  machined  digitally,  and  shaped  as  shown  in  Figure  8.a, 
because bone is brittle when undergoing failure. Lastly, a gauge was positioned to measure 
the  local  deformation  of  the  sample  during  the  failure  process  (Figure  8.b).  The  local

mechanical properties of compact bones were deduced where failure occurred. Stress-strain 
curves are obtained (22). 
 
III RESULTS: EFFECT OF MODEL PARAMETERS  
 
Since  we  modelled  dynamic  traction  experiments,  the  deformation  mechanisms  had  a 
traction wave effect which was reflected on the left-hand side where zero displacement was 
specified. The plastic deformations observed in joints may have resulted from these effects.  
 
III.1 Effect of Structure Heterogeneity and Dimension 
 
Calculations  were  developed  for  fibres  oriented  at  0°,  45°  and  90°  with  respect  to  the 
longitudinal axis of the bone. First, in order to introduce heterogeneity into the structure, 
we defined an interval within which the longitudinal (traction thresholds) and transversal 
thresholds (shearing thresholds), chosen with a stochastic process, could vary. Second, the 
three geometries (21 longitudinal fibres in 30 successive layers, 7 longitudinal fibres in 90 
successive layers and 42 longitudinal fibres in 60 successive layers) were tested. The force-
strain curves showed that structure heterogeneity (Figure 9) and dimension (Table 1) had 
no  effect  on  the  value  of  the  failure  force.  Oscillations  showed  propagation  of  tensile-
compressive waves.  
The force-strain curves (Figure 9) could be divided into two parts: 
- The first part was an elastic linear region from which the values of the Young's modulus 
of the structure could be found. 
- The second part was a damage region up to very brittle failure.  
 
III.2 Effect of the Scattering Parameter 
 
In  this  case,  computations  were  performed  with  fibres  oriented  at  0°,  45°  and  90°  with 
respect to the longitudinal axis of the bone. The length of the interval of the traction and 
shearing  thresholds  chosen  under  these  conditions  varied  (it  represents  the  scattering 
parameter).  The  scattering  parameter  influenced  failure  for  all  three  fibres  orientations: 
structure fractures occurred more rapidly with longer intervals (Figure 10). 
 
III.3 Effect of the Ratio f1/f2  
 
Different  assemblies  of  model-fibres,  linked  together  with  appropriately  chosen  cohesive 
forces,  were  then  explored.  The  fibrous  structure  of  the  model  was  considered  and  the 
ability to bear tensile stress was found to be due to two classes of cohesive forces: forces 
exerted by the fore end of a fibre on the aft end of the proceeding fibre (f1); forces exerted 
flank-to-flank  between  neighbouring  fibres  (f2).  In  the  context  of  tensile  tests,  f1  forces 
were mainly tensile forces while f2 forces were mainly shearing forces; the ratio f1/f2 was 
thus a significant mechanical parameter. We observed that the ratio f1/f2 had no effect on 
the  failure  force  of  the  structure  when  fibres  were  oriented  at  0°  in  comparison  with  the 
longitudinal axis of the bone (Figure 11). This parameter did however have an important 
effect on structure failure when the fibres were oriented at 45° and 90°, particularly when 
the longitudinal joints were stronger than the transversal joints (Figure 12).

IV CONSTITUTIVE LAWS 
 
From the previous results, we found that when the fibres are oriented at 0° with respect to 
the  longitudinal  axis,  only  the  scattering  parameter  plays  an  important  role  in  the  failure 
process.  We  studied  the  evolution  of  the  failure  strain  with  respect  to  the  scattering 
parameter.  We  used  a  least  squares  resolution  method  to  find  representative  laws  of 
compact bones at failure (Figure 13):

axis. In this case, failure depended on two parameters, the scattering and the ratio f1/f2. We

V  COMPARISON 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
 
The  objective  of  this  work  was  to  show  that  a  cohesive  model  analysing  the  failure  of 
bones is in reality comparable to a model analysing macroscopic failure. In the model that 
we  have  developed,  failure  occurs  suddenly,  cohesive  failure  of a few joints triggering a 
step by step failure process in the neighbouring vicinity. Longitudinally and transversally 
connected  joints  were  also  damaged  and  the  structure  was  broken  in  only  a  few  steps 
(Figure  14).  In  the  experimental  results,  failure  also  occurred  very  rapidly.  One 
experimental failure pattern is illustrated in Figure 15. Qualitatively, the experimental and 
computational results were quite similar (Figure 14, 15). Quantitatively, a study taking into

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
To  summarise,  in  this  paper  we  propose  a  new  method  for  investigating  bone  failure, 
following  on  from  the  development  of  earlier  models  of  cortical  bones.  In  our  model, 
bones  are  described  as  fibrous  structures  in  which  deformation  occurs  in  the  fibrous 
elements and damage results from the failure of joints between the fibres. A finite element 
model is used to describe the behaviour of this fibrous structure, based on cohesive laws as 
applied to joint modelling. With the model, we have established how parameters such as 
scattering and the ratio of the traction and shear cohesion thresholds can strongly affect the 
description of the failure process. The cohesive model gives a physical description of the 
damage  resulting  from  joint  cohesive  failure  processes.  The  parameters  describing  the 
heterogeneity  and  the  geometry  do  not  affect  the  behaviour  of  the  structure.  The  ratio

between the longitudinal and the transversal failure stress joints (connecting the heads and 
flanks of adjacent fibres) and the scattering parameter, can be used to control the behaviour 
and  the  development  of  damage  in  the  model.  The  physical  meaning  of  the  scattering 
parameter  is  given  by  the  porosity  of  the  material.  These  parameters  are  relevant  for 
studying microstructure, and therefore macrostructure, failure. For the structure modelled 
here,  statistics  on  the  failure  mode  describing  the  development  of  the node status can be 
used to obtain an overall micro macro assembly. The most important feature of this model 
is  that  the  failure  behaviour  of  the  structure  depends  on  these  parameters.  With  this 
approach, the internal value of a microscopic and therefore macroscopic phenomenological 
model dealing with the physics of the damage processes can be defined. 
The qualitative results obtained with this finite element model are in complete agreement 
with  those  obtained  experimentally  for  the  lamellar  structure  of  bone  with  an  Instron 
device. This constitutes a first step towards describing a structural failure model in which 
damage  occurs  as  the  result  of  cohesive  failure  between  the  longitudinal  and  transversal 
joints.  
A  microscopic/macroscopic  assembly  is  needed  for  studying  bones.  The  method  can  be 
used  to  study  the  lamellar/osteonal  assembly  considering  the  lamella  as  the  basic 
component  of  the  osteonal.  This  method  is  a  multi-scale  method.  Finally,  this  finite 
element  model  does  not  take  into  consideration  the  viscosity  of  the  structure  so  as  to 
emphasise  the  cohesive  failure  processes.  We  propose  carrying  out  further  calculations 
introducing for example a viscous component.

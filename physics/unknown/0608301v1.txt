Abstract 

We introduce an improved and simplified structure made of periodic arrays of 
 
pairs of H-shaped metallic wires that offer a potentially simpler approach in building 
negative-index materials.  Using simulations and microwave experiments, we have 
investigated the negative-index n properties of these structures.  We have measured 
experimentally both the transmittance and the reflectance properties and found 
unambiguously that a negative refractive index with Re(n)<0 and Im(n) <Re(n). The 
same is true for ε and μ. Our results show that H-shaped wire pairs can be used very 
effectively in producing materials with negative refractive indices. © 2006 American

The first demonstration of a Left-Handed (LH) material [1,2] by the UCSD group, 
in 2000, following the work by Pendry et. al. [3,4], started a field of  structured materials 
to create electromagnetic response not available in naturally occurring materials. This LH 
materials  [5-8]  made  use  of  an  array  of  conducting,  nonmagnetic  ring-shaped  local 
resonators  elements  to  achieve  a  negative  effective  permeability, μ(ω),  and  an  array  of 
conducting  continuous  wires  to  achieve  a  negative  effective  permittivity,  ε(ω);  the 
simultaneous  combination  of  which  had  never  before  been  observed  in  any  previously 
known  material.  LH  materials  display  unique  “reversed”  electromagnetic  properties,  as 
discussed by Veselago [9] long before such materials existed.  

In  the  past  few  years  there  has  been  ample  proof  for  the  existence  of  Negative 
Index Materials (NIMs) in the GHz frequency range [1-8]. Most NIM implementations to 
date  have  utilized  the  topology  proposed  by  Pendry,  consisting  of  split-ring  resonators 
(SRRs) (rings with gaps, providing the negative μ) and continuous wires (providing the 
negative  ε).  A  lot  of  groups  were  able  to  fabricate  [1,2,5-8]  NIMs  with  an  index  of 
refraction  n  =  -1  and  losses  of  less  than  1  dB/cm.  Recently  different  groups  observed 
indirectly [10-13] negative μ at the THz region. In most of the THz experiments [10-12] 
only  one  layer  of  SRRs  was  fabricated  on  a  substrate  and  the  transmission,  T,  was 
measured  only  for  propagation  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  the  SRRs,  exploiting  the 
coupling of the electric field to the magnetic resonance of the SRR via asymmetry [11]. 
This way it is not possible to drive the magnetic permeability negative. One reason is that 
is very difficult to measure with the existing topology of SRRs and continuous wires both 
the transmission, T, and reflection, R, along the direction parallel to the plane of the SRRs. 

 

 

So  there  is  a  need  for  alternative,  improved  and  simplified  designs  that  can  be  easily 
fabricated and experimentally characterized. Currently, there is much interest in pushing 
the  frequency  range  for  NIM  behavior  into  the  infrared  and  optical  regions  of  the 
spectrum [14-16]. However, the currently observed negative index in the THz region [12] 
is  actually  due  to  significant  imaginary  parts  of  ε  and  μ  which  lead  to  a  dominant 
imaginary  part  of  n  and  result  in  a  rapid  attenuation  of  EM  wave  consequently,  which 
make such kind of meta-material inapplicable.  

In this letter, we report our investigations into wire-pair structures as alternatives 
to  conventional  SRR-based  NIMs.  The  basic  structure  of  a  single  unit  cell  of  the  NIM 
build  from  H-shaped  wires  is  shown  in  Fig.1A.    In  the  wire-pair  arrangement,  the 
conventional  SRR  is  replaced  with  a  pair  of  short  parallel  wires,  which  provide  both 
negative  magnetic  and  electric  response;  the  continuous  wires  are  not  necessary.    The 
short  wire  pair  consist  of  a  pair  of  metal  patches  separated  by  a  dielectric  spacer  of 
thickness  ts.  For  an  electromagnetic  wave  incident  with  a  wave  vector  and  field 
polarization  as  shown  in  Fig.  1A,  the  short  wire  pair  will  process  not  only  a  magnetic 
resonance resulting in a negative μ [15-17] but also an electric resonance with a negative 
ε simultaneously. The magnetic resonance originates from the anti-parallel current in the 
wire pair with opposite sign charge accumulating at the corresponding ends; the electric 
resonance  is  due  to  the  excitation  of  parallel  current  in  the  wire  pair  with  same  sign 
charge  accumulating  at  the  corresponding  ends  of  both  wires.  Repeating  this  basic 
structure periodically in the x-, y-, and z-directions would result in a NIM structure.

To  examine  the  potential  usefulness  of  the  wire-pair  structures  as  NIMs,  we 
characterized the properties of the wire-pair of Fig. 1A using simulations and microwave 
measurements and then used these results to determine the expected properties of NIMs 
built from the wire-pair building blocks.  Simulations of wire-pair structures were done 
with  CST  Microwave  Studio  (Computer  Simulation  Technology  GmbH,  Darmstadt, 
Germany),  which  uses  a 
to  determine 
reflection/transmission amplitudes of metallo-dielectric structures.  In the simulations, the 
dielectric properties of the metal patches were described by a frequency-dependent Drude 
model.  The  detailed  calculations  were  used  to  determine  the  reflection  and  the 
transmission coefficients from a single unit cell with periodic boundary condition in the 
direction perpendicular to the direction of the incident wave.  Experimental transmission

and  reflection  data  were  obtained  by  building  and  measuring  microwave-frequency 
versions  of  the  wire-pair  structures.    These  were  fabricated  using  Rogers  5880  printed 
circuit board stock with dielectric-layer thickness of 254 µm and listed relative dielectric 
constant of 2.53.  The circuit board was coated on both sides with 10-µm thick layers of 
copper.  The  copper  was  formed 
the  wire-pair  patterns  using  conventional 
photolithography  techniques.  For  the  samples  reported  here  (both  simulations  and 
experiments),  the  width  of  the  metal  wires  was 1  mm.  The  length  and the  width  of  the 
metal bars at each end of the wire pairs was 4mm and 0.2 mm respectively. The length of 
the short wire pairs was 4 mm, and the unit cell size was 4.2 mm x 8 mm x 2.274 mm. 
The total sample size was 9 x 17 x 1 unit cells, resulting in approximately square samples. 
A photograph of one side of a complete sample is shown in Fig. 1B. With these patterned 
dimensions on the printed-circuit board material, the resonances for NIM-behavior were 
expected to occur near 15.8 GHz 

in 

Transmission and reflection properties of a single-layer structure were measured 
over the frequency range of 14 – 18 GHz using a network analyzer (HP 8510) and a pair 
of  standard  gain  horn  antennas  serving  as  source  and  receiver.  In  the  transmission 
measurements,  the  microwaves  were  incident  normal  to  the  sample  surface.  This  is  a 
tremendous  simplification  relatively  to  the  conventional  SRRs  and  wires  where  the 
incident electromagnetic waves have to propagate parallel to the sample surface. With the 
conventional  orientation  of  the  SRRs,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  do  these  type  of 
measurements at the THz region, since only single-layer samples are usually fabricated 
[10,11].  Transmission  measurements  were  calibrated  to  the  transmission  between  the 
horns with the sample removed. The reflection measurements were done by placing the 
source and receiving horns on the same side of the sample and bouncing the microwave 
signal off the sample. The source and receiver horns were each inclined with an angle of 
about 7.5° with respect to normal on the sample surface. The reflection measurement was 
calibrated  using  a  sample-sized  sheet  of  copper  as  reflecting  mirror.  In  both 
measurements,  the  electric  field  of  the  incident wave  was  polarized  parallel  to  the  long 
dimension  of  the  wires.    (For  perpendicular  polarization,  the  transmission  was  nearly 
100%, independent of frequency in the resonance region, and reflection was essentially 
zero.)

radiation incident on the wire-pair structures. The green dashed curve shows the simulated transmission spectrum

The calculated and measured transmission spectra are shown in Fig. 2.  There is 
good qualitative agreement between simulations and measurements. To demonstrate the 
appearance of the expected left-handed transmission band more clearly than it is visible 
from the single unit cell spectra, we include the simulated transmission through five unit 
cells as the dashed line.  The measured spectrum does show additional resonance peaks 
and  valleys  due  to  reflections  between  the  receiving  horn  and  the  sample.    Using  the 
transmission  and  reflection  results  from  a  single  layer,  we  can  extract  the  effective 
refractive  index  that  would  result  if  a  periodic  multi-layer  sample  were  built  using  the 
single-layer  structure  as  a  building  block.    The  details  of  the  numerical  retrieval 
procedure have been described in detail elsewhere [18-20].  In performing the retrieval, 
we have assumed a z-direction size of the unit cell of 2.274 mm. Such that the individual 
wire-pair layers are separated from each other by a significant air space.  

 

Figure 3. Extracted refractive index n of a periodic array of wire-pair unit cells, using the simulated (solid curves) 
and measured (dotted curves) transmission and reflection data. The red and blue curves show the real part of n 
and imaginary part of n respectively. 

The  extracted  refractive  index  is  shown  in  Fig.  3  and  the  extracted  permittivity 
and permeability are shown in Fig. 4.  The plots show that the real part of the permittivity 
is negative over most of the measured range.  The real part of the permeability is negative 
over  a  resonance  band  above  15.8  GHz  for  both  of  the  simulation  (approximate  15.87-
16.00  GHz)  and  the  measurement  (approximate  15.82-15.98  GHz).  The  extracted  real 
part of the refractive index is negative [21] over a narrow band around 15.8 GHz for both 
of the simulations (15.59-16.17 GHz) and the experiments (15.67 -16.02 GHz), dipping 
as  low  as  -2.66  using  measured  data  and  -2.86  from  the  simulation.  The  ratio  of  the 
imaginary part of n to the real part of n reaches 1/3 above the resonance, which means 
that  we  have  left-handed  propagation  with  ε, μ and  n  negative.  The  simplicity  of  the 
short-wire pair design and the alleviation of the need for continuous wires generating the 
negative effective permittivity is expected to facilitate scaling of the structure to achieve 
left-handed  response  well  within  the  THz  region.  However  the  reader  should  be  aware 
that  straightforward  geometric  scaling  of  the  present  design  is  not  possible  as  the 
behavior  of  the  metals  changes  from  lossy  conductors  in  GHz  to  lossy,  negative 
dielectrics in the higher THz region [22]. Our preliminary numerical results show that a 
negative index left-handed band with both, εand µ negative, and n'/n'' ratio better than 6

can  be  achieved  combining  the  second  order  magnetic  resonance  with  the  first  order 
electric resonance for Drude-model silver short-wire pairs at around 490 THz.

reflection data.   

These results show clearly the viability of using short wire pairs to build negative-
index  materials.    It  is  likely  that  modifications  of  the  basic  structure  studied  here  may 
improve  or  alter  the  NIM  properties.  Also,  wire-pair  arrangements  with  significantly 
different  geometries  may  lead  to  negative-index  materials.    The  relative  ease  of 
fabricating  wire-pair  structures  pairs  may  hasten  the  development  of  NIMs  working  at 
optical wavelengths.

In lossy materials is possible to have the real part n to be negative, without having 
the real parts of ε and μ simultaneously negative. This is the case of the recent work of S. 
Zhang, W.J. Fan, N.C. Panoiu, K.J. Malloy, R.M. Osgood, S.R.J. Brueck. Phys. Rev. Lett. 
95,137404 (2005). This can happen if the imaginary parts of ε and μ are sufficiently large, 
because  in  a  lossy  material  n = ′n + i ′′n ,  and  we  also  have  that  n = εz  and   z = μ/ ε. 

′n = ′ε ′z − ′′ε ′′z and  z =

After some algebra we obtain that 

′μ ′ε + ′′μ ′′ε
ε2
so it’s possible to have    ′n < 0 , provided that 
′′ε ′′z > ′ε ′z .  In this scenario which occurs 
at  the  low-frequency  side  of  the 
′n < 0  region  in  Fig.  3,  however,  the  imaginary  parts 
lead to dominant losses such that we have a transmission gap with some negative phase 
shift rather than LH transmission (with some losses). This type of negative n should not 
be  considered  LH  behavior.  In  our  experiments,  although  we  have  considerable 
imaginary parts, the behavior is still dominated by the negative real part of n at the high-
frequency side where we find the LH behavior. As one can see from the Fig.3, we obtain 
n'/n''=2 for experiment and n'/n''=3 for simulation at n'=-2.

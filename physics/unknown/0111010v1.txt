Abstract 

Proposed  fourth  generation  light  sources  using  SASE  FELs  to  generate 
short  pulse,  coherent,  X-rays  require  demonstration  of  high  brightness 
electron sources.  The Gun Test Facility (GTF) at SLAC was built to test 
high brightness sources for the proposed Linac  Coherent Light Source at 
SLAC.    The  transverse  emittance  measurements  are  made  at  nearly  30 
MeV  by  measuring  the  spot  size  on  a  YAG  screen  using  the  quadrupole 
scan technique.  The emittance was measured to vary from 1 to 3.5 mm-
mrad  as  the  charge  is  increased  from  50  to  350  pC  using  a  laser  pulse 
width  of  2  ps  FWHM.    The  measurements  are  in  good  agreement  with 
simulation results using the LANL version of PARMELA.

Proposed  fourth  generation  light  sources  using  SASE  FELs  to  generate  short  pulse, 
coherent, X-rays require demonstration of high brightness electron sources.  The Gun Test 
Facility  (GTF) at  SLAC  was  built to test high  brightness sources  for the  proposed  Linac

nearly  30  MeV  by  measuring  the  spot  size  on  a  YAG  screen  using  the  quadrupole  scan 
technique.  The emittance was measured to vary from 1 to 3.5 mm-mrad as the charge is 
increased from 50 to 350 pC using a laser pulse width of 2 ps FWHM.  The measurements 
are in good agreement with simulation results using the LANL version of PARMELA.

1.  Introduction 
 
 
 

The Gun Test Facility (GTF) is dedicated to the development of a high brightness 

electron source capable of producing a 1 mm-mrad emittance beam with at least 1 nC of 

charge  to  drive  the  Linac  Coherent  Light  Source  (LCLS)  [1].    PARMELA  simulations 

indicate  the  possibility  of  the  GTF  producing  the  desired  beam  using  an  emittance 

compensated 1.6 cell S-band photocathode gun with an approximately flat-top temporally 

shaped  laser  pulse  driving  the  cathode  [2].    Emittances  measured  at  low  charge  (<  350 

pC) with relatively short pulse lengths and Gaussian pulse shapes will be presented here.

The results are in agreement with PARMELA simulations.  This agreement suggests that 

PARMELA can be used to verify the new LCLS photoinjector design [3]. 

2.  Experimental Setup 
 

 

The GTF laser is an Nd:glass based system utilizing chirped pulse amplification.  

After the amplifier is an optical compressor with one of the compressor gratings mounted 

on an optical rail to allow for pulse length adjustments by varying the grating separation 

and  thus  the  compression  ratio.    The  resulting  IR  pulse  is  then  frequency  doubled  and 

quadrupled  in  a  1.25  mm  long,  type  I,  BBO  crystal  and  a  0.5  mm  long,  type  I  BBO 

crystal respectively.  A streak camera with 1 ps resolution in the UV was used to make 

temporal  pulse  shape  measurements.    Typical  UV  pulse  length  measurements  for  two 

different  compression  settings  are  plotted  in  Figure  1.    Averaged  over  several 

measurements the shapes are near Gaussian with FWHM of 1.8 and 4.3 ps. 

 

 

The RF gun installed at the GTF is a 1.6 cell, S-band, photocathode, rf gun with 

cavity  symmetrization  to  remove  dipole  fields  and  the  associated  emittance  growth  [4].  

The current  cathode  is a 1 cm diameter piece  of  single crystal copper  (100 orientation) 

brazed onto the polycrystalline copper backplate.  A 20 cm long emittance compensating 

solenoid  [5]  is  located  at  the  gun  exit  followed  by  a  single  3  m  traveling  wave  SLAC 

linac  structure.    The  distance  from  the  cathode  to  the  input  of  the  linac  section  is 

approximately 90 cm. 

The  transverse  emittance  of  the  e-beam  is  measured  downstream  of  the  linac 

booster by measuring the beam size on a 20 mm diameter, 0.5 mm thick YAG screen [6] 

as a function of quadrupole current (quadrupole scan technique).  The YAG screen is 1.2 

m downstream of the last quadrupole and is installed at normal incidence to the e-beam.

The  light  is  extracted  through  a  standard  viewport  and  sent  to  an  analog  CCD  camera.  

The resolution of the optical imaging system was measured to be approximately 50 µm.  

Images are captured and stored with an 8-bit frame grabber. 

 

 At each quadrupole current five images are captured along with one background 

image.  After background subtraction the images are projected onto the horizontal axis, 

and the wings truncated at the point that is 5% of the peak value.  A true rms calculation 

is performed on the truncated projection to find the rms beam size.  The beam widths are 

averaged  over  the  five  data  points  and  the  emittance  fit  uses  weighting  inversely 

proportional to the rms spread in the data points.  The emittance fit is calculated using the 

standard  linear  matrix  along  the  beam  line  [7]  and  thus  does  not  include  space  charge 

along  the  drift  region  between  quadrupole  and  screen.    A  typical  quadrupole  scan  is 

shown  in  Figure  2  with  the  measured  rms  beam  sizes  as  a  function  of  the  quadrupole 

strength plotted as diamonds.   

3.  Results 
 

 

We have measured the emittance as a function of charge for the two laser pulse 

lengths shown in Figure 1.  Figure 3 plots as discreet points the minimum rms normalized 

emittances measured at a given charge for both the 1.8 and 4.3 ps FWHM laser pulses.  

The solenoid field has been optimized for each data point plotted.  Due to laser intensity 

fluctuations,  the  rms  charge  fluctuation  over  each  measurement  is  approximately  15%.  

The accelerator parameters are as follows; gun gradient of 110 MV/m, extraction phase 

of 38°, linac gradient of 8.5 MV/m and the linac phase which produces minimum energy 

spread.  The minimum energy spread for the 4.3 ps pulses occurs at a linac phase of -13° 

and for the 1.8 ps data it is -20° relative to the crest of the wave.  The minimum measured 

 

4 

emittance  is  just  under  1  mm-mrad  for  a  1.8  ps  pulse  at  a  charge  of  105  pC  and  the 

maximum  emittance  is  3.5  mm-mrad  at  350  pC.    The  uncertainty  in  the  emittance 

measurements  is  dominated  by  charge  fluctuations.    Each  point  on  the  emittance  curve 

can be reproduced to the order of 20%. 

 

A  series  of  simulations  with  the  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory  version  3  of 

PARMELA were  conducted to compare with the measured results.  Figure 3 shows the 

simulated normalized rms emittance as a function of charge for two different laser pulse 

lengths.  These lines are within the range of the measurements presented here up to 250 

As the charge is increased above 50 pC, PARMELA predicts the 4 ps data to have 

higher emittance than the 2 ps data despite the decrease in the space charge force for the 

longer  pulse.    The  increase  in  emittance  is  due  to  a  mismatch  of  the  beam  to  the  linac 

booster  gradient.    A  proper  match  is  achieved  for  laminar  flow  when  equation  1  is 

satisfied,  where γ is  the  lorentz factor,  Ip is  the  peak current,  IA is 17 kA,  σ

w is the rms 

beam  size  at  a  waist  located  at  the  linac  entrance  and  El  is  the  linac  gradient  [8].    The 

transverse  phase  space  at  the  quadrupole  location  of  5  central  time  slices  are  shown  in 

Figure  4(cid:3) for  the  2  ps  (top)  and  4  ps  (bottom)  pulses  for  300  pC  from  Figure  3.    The 

graphs are labelled with the slope, s, of the linear regression, the emittance, ε, of the slice 

and the fraction of particles in that particular slice. For the 2 ps pulse, the 3 central slices, 

which contain 75% of the particles, are well aligned. For the 4 ps case the slice emittance 

is smaller, but the strong misalignment results in a larger projected emittance.  When the 

linac gradient in the 4 ps case is reduced to satisfy equation 1, the simulated normalized 

rms emittance is also decreased.

4.  Conclusions 
 

 

We  have  measured  the  transverse  emittance  from  an  emittance  compensated 

photoinjector  at  low  charge  using  a  quadrupole  scan  technique.    The  emittance  was 

measured to vary from 1 to 3.5 mm-mrad as the charge is increased from 50 to 350 pC 

using  a  laser  pulse  width  of  1.8  ps  FWHM.    The  measurements  are  in  reasonable 

agreement  with  PARMELA  simulation  results.    In  the  future  we  will  measure  the 

emittance at higher charges and with temporally flat-top laser pulses.

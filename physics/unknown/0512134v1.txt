Abstract:  Gravity  field  theory  and  electromagnetic  field  theory  are  well  established  and 
confirmed by experiments. The Schwarzschild metric and Kerr Metric of Einstein field equation 
shows  that  the  spatial differential of time  gauge is the  gravity  field.  For  pure time  displacement 
field, when its spatial differentials are commutative, conservative fields can be established. When 
its  spatial  differentials  are  non-commutative,  Maxwell  electromagnetic  field  equations  can  be 
established.  When  the  contra-covariant  is  required  for  the  non-commutative  field,  both  Lorentz 
gauge and Coulomb gauge are derived in this research. The paper shows that the light is a special 
matter in that the addition of its Newtonian mass and its Coulomb electric charge is zero. In fact, 
this  conclusion  is  true  for  the  electromagnetic  wave  in  vacuum.  For  the  conservative  field,  the 
research  shows  that once the  mass  density  and  the Coulom  charge dendity  are given,  the  macro 
spacetime feature is completely determined. Both of them are intrisinc features of macro matter in 
cosimic background. However, for the cosmic ages old events, the spatial curvature may be cannot 
be ignored. On this sense, the oldest gravity field has the largest curvature of space. This point is 
very intrinsic for astronomy matters.   
 
Key Words: general relativity, electromagnetic field, gravity field, motion transformation 
 
1. Introduction 

In  the  paper  “Inertial  System  and  Special  Relativity”[1],  the  symmetric  matter  motion 

transformation is discussed.   

For  Newtonian  matter  motion,  the  vacuum  is  taken  as  a  special  matter  with  one  intrinsic 
physical  parameter-light  speed  c .  For  any  matter,  it  can  be  identified  with  co-moving 

coordinators  with  local  varying  geometry.  The  local  varying  geometry  represents  the  motion  of 
matter  in  consideration.  The  motion  equation  of  matter  is  determined  by  cosmic  environment 
where the matter existing, where two intrinsic physical parameters are introduced to define matter 
as 

,( µλ . 

)

When the time gradient of time displacement is forced to be zero, the Newton’s mechanical 
equation  is  gotten.  It  shows  that  the  Newton’s  mass  is  determined  by  the  shear  feature  of 

space-time continuum. The Newton’s mass is expressed as 

/ cµρ=

2

. 

When  the  matter  has  no  macro  spatial  motion,  such  as  gravity  field  or  electronic  field,  the 
time displacement field is introduced to describe the matter motion. One finds that gravity field, 
electro-magnetic field, and quantum field are time gradient field. They are related with Newton’s 
mechanics in intrinsic sense. When there is no electrical charge quantity, the gravity mass and the 
inertial mass in Newton’s mechanics are the same.   

The  matter  has  three  typical  existing  forms:  traveling  wave,  localized  harmonic  vibrating

particle, and exponential expanding or decaying matter field.   

The  commutable  matter  motion  defines  conservative  field.  The  non-commutable  matter 
motion  defines  quantum  field.  The  wave  particle  duality  is  explained  by  deformable  matter 
motion.   

In  this  part,  pure  time  displacement  field  will  be  discussed.  In  this  case  the  motion 
transformation is non-symmetric. The research shows that the electromagnetic field can be defined 
by the pure time displacement field, the Maxwell equations are derived in this part. 

Firstly, the basic equations are reviewed simply.

Usually, one does not care how the original matter motion state is in the absolute spacetime. 
One just takes the matter under discussion as a self-exist object. In this sense, the initial matter can 
be generally defined by select the initial co-moving coordinator system to make:

On this sense, the reference matter is taken to define the spacetime continuum where the matter 
under discussion is moving. 
 

The  principle  of  physical  laws  covariant  invariance  requires  the  general  reference  matter 

motion be coordinator independent. To meet these requirements, the tensor

where,  λ  and  µ  are  the  intrinsic  feature  of  matter  referring  to  reference  matter.  For  Newton 

mechanics, the reference matter is vacuum or ether. For the isotropic tensor in mixture form please 
refer [9]. In standard physical theory, the mixed form is refused. However, the research shows that 
the  mixture  form  is  necessary  to  show  the  non-commutative  feature  of  matter  motion 
transformation tensor. This topic should treat in future rather at present.

the paper will go straight a way. Only when the whole research is carefully polished at later time, 
some ambiguity can be effectively removed. 
 
2. Matter Motion Without Macro Spatial Motion 

There exists such a kind of matter motion that time displacement gradient are non-zero while 
the spatial displacement gradient are all zeros. Note that the physical components of time  dt   will 

be used in physical motion equation in the sense that:

Its stress field is composed of an isotropic stress tensor and a non-symmetrical stress tensor. 
The isotropic stress tensor shows the matter may be a pure continuum matter field (be named as 
field  matter,  here  after).  This  is  significantly  different  from  Newtonian  matter  in  that  the 
Newtonian matter is related with symmetrical stress tensor.

3. Conservative Field Matter Motion Equation (Commutative Case) 

If  the  partial  differential  of  time  displacement  is  commutable  about  space  and  time 
differentiation, the matter will behave as conservative field matter. As the commutability of space 
and time differentiation will make the equation (19) be rewritten as:

And  ρ~   is  defined  as  matter  complete  charge  quality;  scalar A   is  defined  as  the  potential  of 

matter  field.  It  can  be  seen  that  A   may  represent  gravity  field  and/or  static  electronic  field. 
Based on this understanding, gravity field and electronic field are produced by time displacement 
gradient. For gravity field, the Schwarzschild’s solution of gravity field [6-8] introduces Newton’s 
gravity field with the help of time gauge differentiation. 

The equation (20)  has  three  typical  solutions,  which depend on  the  feature of  cosmic  force 

4f

  in the case that it is a constant. For the exact physical meaning of it will be discussed later 

(As it depends on the action function time variation, so it can be understood as energy at present. 
In the paper, it is roughly named as cosmic force without detailed discussion).

macro  matter  feature  is  completely  determined.  There  for  both  of  them  are  intrisinc  features  of 
macro matter in cosimic background.   
For massless inertial matter,

The negative matter has been discussed in physics for long time. Here, the research views the 
negative matter the matter defined by  λ  parameter. If one takes the matter and negative matter as 

the basic parameter, the electrical charge will be a derivative parameter (lost its basic position). As 
the  physics  has  taken  the  mass  and  electrical  charge  as  basic  parameter,  there  is  no  need  to 
introduce the negative matter concept (although it may be helpful for some cases).

This solution corresponds to self-rotation of particle or vibrating field. It shows how the electronic 
field and gravity field are coupled together in wave form.   

In fact, for positive energy, the solution shows the motion of particles with negative electric 

charge.   

The  (b)  and  (c)  cases  show  that  the  time  feature  of  commutative  field  matter  motion  is 
determined by the electric charge and cosmic force. In fact, they are the basic form of molecular or 
atom  quantum  field,  where  the  elctric  charge play an  important  role.  The  frequency  of  quantum 
can be defined as:

On  the  other  hand,  it  can  be  infereed  that  for  the  matter  with  very  large  electric  charge 
 
quantity the frequency will be continuous. Hence, the quantum phenomenor is related with samll 
charge matter. Note that it is conservative quantum field. 
 
4. Non-commutable Field Matter Motion Equation (Quantum Mechanics) 

If  the  partial  differential  of  time  displacement  is  non-commutative  about  space  and  time 
differentiation, the matter will behave as quantum electromagnetic field matter. The equation (19)

As  A   is defines the conservative matter field, the 

iB   should be defined as the vector potential 

of  matter  field,  such as  magnetic  field.  It  should  be  noted that  the  force produced by  the vector 
potential of matter field is related with Newton’s matter mass. 

The equation (35)  has  three  typical  solutions,  which depend on  the  feature of  cosmic  force

  in the case that it is a constant.

ik , one will has: 

The intrinsic feature of wave number-frequency relation is that it is completely determined by the 
charge  and  mass  ratio.  In  physics,  for  basic  particles,  the  charge-mass  indeed  plays  as  basic 
parameter. This is clear from following discussion.

This field corresponds to a conservative field in four-dimensional coordinator system.   

Without outside source, the variation of cosmic force 

4f

  will produce an additional electric 

potential. This additional electric potential will produce spatial forces. 

If one defines this as weak action force, the field described by equation (20) may be defined 

as strong action. 

Summing  up  above  discussion  about  time  displacement  field,  one  finds  that  gravity  field, 
electro-magnetic field, and quantum field are time gradient field. They are related with Newton’s 
mechanics in intrinsic sense. So, the united field theory of matter motion can be expressed by the 
finite geometrical field theory given by this paper.

(a). Non-Quantum Matter Motion (Newton Mass-point) 
Based on the previous research, for non-quantum matter motion the time displacement field 
component can be replaced by Newton’s Acceleration Law. It is equivalent to suppose there is no 
time displacement. Hence, we suppose for non-quantum matter motion:

motion distance as geometrical invariant. For Newton’s matter point, it leads to the kinetic energy 
conservation. By equation (64), for mass  ρ  distribution, the spatial integral:

In general relativity theory and in gauge field theory, this equation form is used to define the 

geometry of space-time continuum under the meaning that the 

  is the geometrical invariant 

2Σd

of “word-line distance”. However, based on this paper’s research, this is only true when the time 
displacement is normal and in form (71) or (72). For more complicated matter motion, the gauge 
field theory and general relativity will be failed. 

Summing up above discussion, we can see that traditional physical conservation laws and the 
geometrical  invariant introduced  by the gauge  field  theory  and general  relativity  are  included  in 
the finite geometrical field theory as simple special cases.

Hence, we suppose for quantum matter motion: 

Hence, the geometrical invariant of non-quantum matter motion is:

So, we can define time displacement is a scalar function in four-dimensional time-space. As a 

special case, this geometrical invariant can be explained as matter-energy conservation. 

In  the  paper  “Inertial  System  and  Special  Relativity”[1],  the  conservative  field  (gravitation 

field and static electric field) has a typical solution in form:

  of  the  matter; 

M parameter may be related to Newtonian mass of the matter or the static charge of the matter, or 
their summation, which depends on the topic. Here, it is simply refereed as general charge. In this 
case, the time displacement is the only one non-zero displacement component.

For simplicity,

the part three paper of this research, where quantum mechanics is the main theme). 

For  an  inertial  system  defined  on  the  conservative  matter  and  the  constant  general  charge, 
, putting the general solution (70) into the equation (71), one has:

For  gravity  field,  the  equation  (73)  is  approximation  of  the  typical  solution  Schwarzschild 

 
metric. The equation (72) is the approximation of Kerr metric.   

To make this point clear, let’s consider the requirement of inertial system. For this case, the 

physical time scale is defined by:

g

=

g

0
44

2

=

c

, to make the space scale be the absolute same (not 

dependent on 

(

4

x

)

), the space scale must be adjusted to make: 

g ii

( g
)

44

  is the absolute same. 

So,  the  current  gauge  that  meets  the  definition  of  inertial  system  and  the  conservative  field 
equations can be defined as:

On  this  sense,  the  oldest gravity  field has  the  largest  curvature of  space.  This  point  is very 
intrinsic for astronomy matters. Therefore, it is easy to understand that the general relativity theory 
is well accepted by astronomy physics. 
 
Unfortunately,  the  effects  caused  by  the  cosmic  age  dependent  curvature  of  space  are  not 
taken into consideration for the observation cosmics or astronomy physics. This may be the main 
cause of introducing the Big-ban theory and its related alternatives. 
 
For the micro-world matter, when the electric charge is concerned, the old matter still has a 
much curvature space. This makes the quantum mechanics become the most complicated physical 
world, where the general relativity still play an important role. This will be the main topic of next 
paper on finite geometrical field theory. 
 
6. Conclusion 

 

When  the  matter  has  no  macro  spatial  motion,  such  as  gravity  field  or  electronic  field,  the 
time displacement field is introduced to describe such a kind of matter motion. For commutative 
case, it is founded that gravity field, electro-magnetic field, and quantum field are time gradient 

field. The absolute electrical charge quantity may be expressed as 

(~
q
=

µλ+

/)

c

2

. When there is 

no electrical charge quantity, the gravity mass and the inertial mass in Newton’s mechanics are the 
same. The matter has three typical existing forms: traveling wave, localized harmonic vibrating, 
and exponential expanding or decaying. The commutable matter motion defines conservative field. 

The  commutative  matter  motion  defines  a  quantum  field  charge 

(~
cµλρ
=
+

/)2

2

  (defined  as 

matter complete quality).   

For  non-commutative  matter  motion,  the  Maxwell  electromagnetic  field  equations  are 
established, based on the covariant form of matter motion equation derived from the least action 
principle.  When  the  contra-covariant  is  required  for  the  non-commutative  field,  both  Lorentz

gauge and Coulomb gauge are derived in this research. The paper shows that the light is a special 
matter in that the addition of its Newtonian mass and its Coulomb electric charge is zero. In fact, 
this conclusion is true for the electromagnetic wave in vacuum 

For  the  conservative  field,  the  research  shows  that  once  the  mass  density  and  the  Coulom 
charge dendity are given, the macro spacetime feature is completely determined.Both of them are 
intrisinc features of macro matter in cosimic background. 

However,  for  the  cosmic  ages  old  events,  the  spatial  curvature  may  be  cannot  be  ignored

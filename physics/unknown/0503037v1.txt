Abstract 
 
Surface  neutron  counter  data  are  often  used as  a  proxy  for atmospheric  ionisation  from 
cosmic  rays 
in  studies  of  extraterrestrial  effects  on  climate.  Neutron  counter 
instrumentation  was  developed  in  the  1950s  and  relationships  between  neutron  counts, 
ionisation  and  meteorological  conditions  were  investigated  thoroughly  using  the 
techniques  available  at  the  time;  the  analysis  can  now  be  extended  using  modern  data. 
Whilst surface neutron counts are shown to be a good proxy for ionisation rate, the usual 
meteorological  correction  applied  to  surface  neutron  measurements,  using  surface 
atmospheric  pressure,  does  not  completely  compensate  for  tropospheric  effects  on 
neutron data. Residual correlations remain between neutron counts, atmospheric pressure 
and geopotential height, obtained from meteorological reanalysis data. These correlations 
may  be  caused  by  variations  in  the  height  and  temperature  of  the  atmospheric  layer  at 
~100hPa. This is where the primary cosmic rays interact with atmospheric air, producing 
a cascade of secondary ionising particles.

1. Introduction 
 

The possible effect of cosmic rays on Earth’s climate system is controversial, as many 
physical  mechanisms  have  been  proposed,  but  none  proven.  In  the  last  few  years, 
evidence  for  two  principal  mechanisms  by  which  atmospheric  ion  formation  by  cosmic 
rays could affect Earth’s climate has emerged. These are described in e.g. Harrison and 
Carslaw (2003) and are briefly summarised below:  

1.  ion-mediated  particle  formation,  which  may  lead  to  the  growth  of  cloud 
condensation nucleii (e.g,  Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, 1997; Yu and Turco, 
2001) 

2.  enhanced removal of charged droplets from clouds (e.g., Tinsley, 2000; Tripathi 

and Harrison, 2002) 

Theoretical  work,  model  predictions  and  laboratory  experiments  exist  supporting  these 
hypotheses, but results from relevant atmospheric experiments are still relatively sparse. 
Accumulation of further atmospheric data to corroborate or refute the existence of any of 
these  effects  requires  quantification  of  ion  concentrations  in  Earth’s  troposphere  and 
stratosphere.  Ideally,  direct  investigation  of  ionisation  effects  on  climate  would  require

frequent  vertical  profiles  of  meteorological  and  ion  measurements  over  a  wide  spatial 
area.  Whilst  new  atmospheric  ion  instrumentation  is  becoming  available  (Aplin  and 
Harrison,  2001;  Holden,  2003),  ion  data  are  still  relatively  rare.  Routine  ion 
measurements at the surface exist at very few locations (e.g. Hõrrak et al, 2000), and ion 
data outside the atmospheric boundary layer are even sparser. This is the reason why the 
cosmic  ray  flux,  responsible  for  almost  all  atmospheric  ionisation  except  close  to  the 
continental surface, is often used as a proxy for atmospheric ion concentrations. Cosmic 
ray fluxes have been routinely monitored by a surface neutron counter network since the 
International Geophysical Year in 1956/7. There are now ~50 monitors well-distributed 
worldwide, and the data is readily available on the Internet (Pyle, 2000).  

Many studies of cosmic ray effects on meteorological parameters have been based on 
data  from  this  neutron  monitor  network.  These  studies  rely  on  the  assumptions  that 
neutron monitor data are, first, a good proxy for the ionisation rate from cosmic rays and, 
secondly,  independent  of  atmospheric  parameters.  Whilst  the  validity  of  these 
assumptions was established for the purposes needed at the time during the development 
of  the  neutron  counter  fifty  years  ago,  investigations  have  not  been  extended  using 
modern techniques. Many of the possible cosmic ray-climate signals appear to be at the 
few  percent  level  (e.g.  Svensmark  and  Friis-Christensen,  1997),  so  there  is  a  need  to 
verify  that  such  signals  are  not  spuriously  generated  by  residual  atmospheric  effects  on 
the cosmic ray measurements, incompletely removed by the atmospheric corrections. In 
this  paper,  historical  and  modern  data  are  used  to  develop  the  early  work  relating 
atmospheric  processes  to  surface  cosmic  ray  intensities.  Background  into  cosmic  ray 
propagation  in  the  atmosphere  is  given  in  Section  2,  followed  by  a  description  of  the 
geophysical  and  meteorological  parameters  that  were  understood  in  the  1950s  to 
modulate  cosmic  radiation.  In  Section  4  the  development  of  cosmic  ray  neutron 
monitoring  and  the  routine  correction  for  atmospheric  pressure  are  briefly  discussed. 
Finally, modern meteorological data is used to show that there are residual tropospheric 
effects  on  pressure  corrected  neutron  counts,  which  may  cause  correlations  between 
cosmic ray fluxes and other atmospheric parameters. 

2.  Cosmic rays in the atmosphere 

Most  atmospheric  ions  originate  from  cosmic  ray  ionisation.  Near  the  continental 
surface, natural radioisotopes contribute about 80% of the ionisation rate, defined as the 
number of ions formed per unit volume per second, but this contribution decreases with 
height  and  is  negligible  outside  the  atmospheric  boundary  layer.  Cosmic  rays  are  high-
energy ionising radiation, entering Earth’s atmosphere from space; most are now thought 
to  come  from  supernovae  (Shaviv,  2002;  Wolfendale,  2003).  Primary  cosmic  rays  are 
energetic particles, which interact with atmospheric air molecules when the air becomes 
sufficiently  dense,  at  a  pressure  surface  of  ~100-200  hPa  (~100-200  gcm-2).  These 
pressures  are  found  at  ~11-16  km  in  the  upper  troposphere  or  lower  stratosphere, 
depending  on  season  and  latitude.  When  cosmic  rays  interact  with  other  air  molecules, 
secondary  subatomic  particles,  usually  mesons,  are  produced,  which  interact  with  more 
air  molecules,  and  so  on  as  the  air  density  (pressure)  increases  down  to  the  surface,  to 
produce a “nucleonic cascade” of particles including high-energy and thermal neutrons, 
protons, muons and electrons (Simpson et al., 1953). Thermal neutrons interact strongly

with atmospheric water vapour, whereas the protons, muons and electrons lose energy by 
ionisation  when  they  interact  with  atmospheric  air  molecules.  The  ionisation  rate 
therefore  decreases  from  a  maximum  at  ~15  km,  where  the  flux  of  secondary  particles 
first exceeds the primary particle flux, to the top of the boundary layer where ionisation 
from natural radioactivity starts to dominate over land. Cosmic rays remain the dominant 
source of ionisation in the oceanic boundary layer. 
 
 
3. Modulation of atmospheric ionisation 
 
3.1 Geophysical effects  
 

Simpson (2000) identified the selection and modulation of cosmic ray energies by 
geomagnetic latitude from measurements in the 1950s. The cosmic ray energy spectrum 
extends  over  ~1-1021eV,  with  the  particle  flux  dropping  off  as  energy  increases 
(Bazilevskaya, 2000). The lower-energy cosmic rays are selectively screened by Earth’s 
magnetic field at the mid-latitudes and near the equator. Above geomagnetic latitudes of 
~50º,  the  cosmic  ray  screening  is  insensitive  to  latitude  (Bazilevskaya,  2000).  Solar 
activity affects cosmic rays, as the magnetic field irregularities in the solar wind deflect 
cosmic rays away from Earth, so that primary cosmic ray penetration into the atmosphere 
is  highest  at  solar  minimum.  Tropospheric  ionisation  rates  are  greatest  at  high  latitudes 
during  solar  minimum,  and  lowest  at  equatorial  latitudes  at  solar  maximum  (Gringel  et 
al., 1986). 
 
3.2 Meteorological effects (1940s view) 
 

Meteorological effects on cosmic rays in the atmosphere were discovered during 
fundamental  studies  of  atmospheric  structure  and  properties  in  the  first  half  of  the 
twentieth  century.  For  example,  Loughridge  and  Gast  (1939,  1940)  observed  weather 
fronts affecting surface ionisation chamber measurements (see Section 4) on a cruise in 
the  North  Pacific.  Their  expedition  was  intended  to  investigate  latitudinal  variations  of 
cosmic ray intensity between Seattle and Alaska, but a relationship between cosmic ray 
ionisation and the passage of fronts was also detected. Cold fronts cause a 1% decrease, 
and warm fronts a 0.5% increase in ionisation over the 30 hours it took for the fronts to 
pass.  This  effect  was  robust,  even  after  the  data  had  been  corrected  for  surface  air 
pressure changes. Blackett (1938) had predicted the existence of a meteorological effect 
on cosmic rays due to variations in the average height, and therefore temperature, of the 
atmospheric  layer  where  the  primary  particles  interact  to  produce  secondary  ionising 
particles. This was referred to as the “mesotron producing layer” in Loughridge and Gast 
(1939),  before  the  term  meson  was  universally  used.  Changes  in  temperature  affect 
meson  range  in  air,  and  influence  the  propagation  of  the  nucleonic  cascade,  which 
modulates  the  tropospheric  ionisation  rate.  Before  the  advent  of  widespread  regular 
meteorological  soundings,  weather  data  above  the  surface  were  rare.  Loughridge  and 
Gast  used  assumptions  based  on  early  sounding  data  to  infer  pressure  and  temperature 
aloft during their experiment. Changes in the ionisation rate based on the thickness of the 
“mesotron producing layer” were estimated from the changing height of the tropopause,

affected  by  weather  fronts.  These  predictions  fitted  observed  ionisation  rate  variations. 
Although 
ionisation  chambers  for  cosmic  ray  monitoring  are  now  obsolete, 
meteorological  effects  on  modern  cosmic  ray  data  remain.  Modern  cosmic  ray 
instrumentation, and meteorological effects upon contemporary cosmic ray data, will now 
be outlined. 
 
4. Surface cosmic ray detection instrumentation 
 

Cosmic rays were initially detected using ionisation chambers: sealed containers 
containing  gas  at  atmospheric  pressure,  with  a  collecting  electrode  biased  to  a  fixed 
potential,  and  connected  to  an  electrometer.  Radiation  passing  through  the  chamber 
creates ion pairs, one polarity of which is attracted to the collecting electrode. The current 
detected is proportional to the number of ion pairs created (e.g. Smith, 1966). This was 
the  first  technique  to  measure  radioactivity,  and  early  measurement  units  such  as  the 
Roentgen  were  related  to  the  number  of  ions  formed  in  air.  Hess,  who  is  credited  with 
discovering cosmic rays, defined a unit for cosmic ray intensity, I, the volumetric cosmic 
ray ion production rate in nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure (Hess, 1939). 

geomagnetic 

An  example  of  the  use  of  ionisation  chambers  was  on  the  geophysical  and 
atmospheric  electrical  research  ship,  the  Carnegie.  The  ionisation  chamber  measured 
“penetrating radiation”, i.e the surface ionisation rate from cosmic rays, by counting the 
number of ions produced per unit volume per second. The ionisation chamber used on the 
Carnegie was a copper chamber of about 22 litres in volume, larger than those commonly 
used  at  the  time  (Ault  and  Mauchly,  1926).  Penetrating  radiation  measurements  on 
cruises IV and VI, between 1915 and 1921, have been digitised here, and the geographic 
coordinates  recorded  in  the  measurement  log  converted  into  geomagnetic  coordinates. 
This calculation required the location of the geomagnetic North Pole. The location of this 
pole,  which  hardly  varied  between  1915-1921,  was  calculated  using  altitude  adjusted 
corrected 
http://www.wdc.rl.ac.uk/cgi-
bin/wdcc1/coordcnv.pl).  Coordinate  conversion  was  achieved  by  modelling  the  Earth’s 
magnetic  field  as  a  dipole  in  a  spherical  shell  (Ziegler,  1996).  The  variation  of  the 
ionisation rate from “penetrating radiation” with geomagnetic latitude is shown in Figure 
1. The ionisation rate increases with geomagnetic latitude, as expected from the Earth’s 
magnetic field screening out lower energy cosmic rays towards the geomagnetic equator. 
Cruise VI made measurements over a wider geomagnetic latitude range than Cruise IV, 
and a flattening of the trace can be seen at geomagnetic latitudes >~50º, where the cosmic 
ray atmospheric penetration is no longer geomagnetically screened (see Section 3.1). As 
Figure 1 demonstrates, the ionisation chamber was a simple and effective instrument for 
measuring the ions formed by cosmic rays. Its disadvantages were that it excluded some 
of the lower energy particles (Simpson, 2000), and could also be subject to contamination 
from radioactivity in the walls of the ionisation chamber.

Simpson  invented  the  neutron  counter,  which  responds  to  the  fast  neutrons 
produced by the atmospheric interactions of cosmic rays (Simpson, 2000). In summary, 
the  neutron  counter  is  a  boron  trifluoride  proportional  counter  with  an  enriched  10B 
component. 4He2+ is produced when a neutron interacts with 10B, and the doubly charged 
helium atoms are detected in the proportional counter. In an early comparison, ionisation 
chambers and the new neutron counters were flown together on an aircraft to calibrate the

neutron counter (Simpson, 2000; Biehl et al., 1949). Figure 2a shows ionisation rate and 
neutron  counts  at  9km,  over  a  range  of  geomagnetic  latitudes  (Simpson,  2000).  This 
indicates  that  there  is  an  approximately  linear  relationship  between  ionisation  rate  and 
neutron  counts  in  the  troposphere  over  a  geomagnetic  latitude  range  of  10-50º.  The 
relationship  is  not  expected  to  differ  at  geomagnetic  latitudes  >~50º,  for  the  reasons 
described in Section 3.1. The close relationship between ionisation chamber and neutron 
counter data is corroborated by results from the overlapping period 1953-1957 when an 
ionisation chamber was run at Cheltenham, Massachusetts (Ahluwalia, 1997) at the same 
time  as  the  neutron  monitor  at  Climax,  Colorado,  Figure  2b.    Figure  2c  shows  a  time 
series  for  the  overlapping  period  and  up  to  2000,  in  which  the  solar  cycle  is  clearly 
visible. As suggested in Section 3.2, a pressure correction was needed to compensate for 
the changes in ambient air pressure affecting cosmic ray propagation. With this pressure 
correction  applied  routinely,  the  neutron  counter  has  become  the  standard  surface 
instrumentation for cosmic ray monitoring.  
 
4.1 Neutron counter pressure correction 
 

The  properties  of  the  nucleonic  cascade  in  the  atmosphere  depend  on  the 
interaction  cross-section  of  atomic  nucleii  in  air  per  unit  volume.  Surface  cosmic  ray 
intensity detected by any instrument is therefore affected by the integrated air density, or 
air pressure, in the column of air above it. The level at which primary particles interact 
with air is an especially important factor. The number of subatomic particles produced by 
the nucleonic cascade is a function of the distance travelled by the secondary mesons, and 
the meson range and lifetime is related to the temperature and pressure of the atmospheric 
layer where the primary particles interact (Sandström, 1965).  

Early pressure corrections were based on linear regression using surface pressure 
measurement,  the  coefficients  of  which  differed  slightly  for  each  station  due  to 
geomagnetic  latitude  variations.  Use  of  the  station  surface  pressure  for  the  correction 
initially appears to have been a pragmatic choice based on the data available at the time. 
Sandström  (1965)  argued  that  the  pressure  correction  could  be  improved  by  including 
data  for  the  pressure  and  temperature  of  many  atmospheric  layers.  This  would  take 
account  of  subtle  variations  in  atmospheric  structure  affecting  subatomic  particle 
interactions  (Sandström,  1965;  Clem  and  Dorman,  2000).  More  recently,  sophisticated 
techniques  have  been  developed  to  compute  the  pressure  correction  from  full  Monte 
Carlo  simulations  of  the  nucleonic  cascade  (Clem  and  Dorman,  2000).  Despite  this 
advance,  the  neutron  monitor  stations  retain  a  simple  linear  correction  using  surface 
pressure  readings.  Figure  3  shows  the  effect  of  the  pressure  correction  at  the  Oulu 
neutron monitor (65.05ºN, 25.47ºE) for a sample year of neutron data. It is evident that 
the correction removes much of the pressure dependence of the neutron counter data, but 
there  is  still  a  small  residual  effect  (for  2001)  of  ~  –2  counts/min/hPa  or  ~  -0.3% 
neutrons/% pressure change, with r=0.13. This may not be significant for some analyses, 
but, in the recent studies of cosmic rays and climate, the effects observed in data are often 
at the few percent level. In this context it is important to eliminate any residual effects of 
the atmosphere on the data used to represent cosmic ray intensity.

5. Atmospheric modulation of modern surface neutron count data 
 

Meteorologists use numerical models of the atmosphere for data assimilation: this 
is the generation of globally gridded data coverage of past atmospheric properties derived 
as the best estimate of the atmospheric state  from  all  observations.  This  reanalysis  data 
gives  atmospheric  parameters  available  in  height  profiles  from  the  surface  to  10hPa,  in 
2.5º grid squares. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis geopotential height (height of a pressure 
surface)  data  have  been  used  to  investigate  meteorological  effects  on  surface  neutron 
counts. As the primary particles interact at a constant atmospheric pressure, the 100hPa 
geopotential height can be used as an indicator of the height of the meson producing layer 
(Sandström, 1965).  

More  information  about  the  spatial  variation  of  the  relationship  between 
geopotential height and surface neutron counts can be obtained from vertical meridional 
cross-sections. Neutron data from a midlatitude station, Climax (39.37ºN, 253.82ºE) were 
chosen, as it could be approximately centred on a latitudinal cross-section from 10ºS to 
60ºN,  covering  the  geomagnetic  equator  to  the  latitudes  where  the  cosmic  ray  energies 
are no longer a function of latitude. Correlations between geopotential height and surface 
neutrons  were  computed  from  the  surface  (1000hPa)  to  the  meson  producing  layer 
(100hPa).  The  correlation  contours  for  47  years  of  monthly  average  data  are  shown  in 
Figure 4, indicating an anticorrelation at ~100hPa, at its highest over the tropics, with a 
maximum of r = -0.43.  

The  anticorrelation  is  expected  for  the  following  reasons.  If  the  100hPa 
geopotential  height  increases,  the  meson  producing  layer  is  likely  to  be  colder,  and  the 
mesons have a shorter lifetime, which results in fewer interactions with air and a lower 
surface neutron count (Sandstrom, 1965). Whilst the ratio of meson interactions to meson 
decays is dominant (Clem and Dorman, 2000), there are several competing mechanisms 
related  to  the  lifetime  of  unstable  species  in  the  atmosphere,  and  the  lower  troposphere 
temperature can also affect meson losses due to ionisation (Olbert, 1953).  

The region of highest anticorrelation is close to the geomagnetic equator, where 
only the highest energy primary cosmic rays can enter the atmosphere. This suggests that 
the neutron production from high-energy nuclear disintegrations may be more sensitive to 
atmospheric effects than lower energy interactions. The meson producing layer is usually 
in the troposphere near the equator, and in the stratosphere in the mid to high latitudes, so 
the spatial variation of the anticorrelation may also be related to dynamical processes in 
the atmosphere. 

This could be linked to the persistent relationship between the 10.7cm solar flux, 
a solar activity indicator, and the 30hPa geopotential height (Labitzke, 2001). However, it 
is  difficult  to  separate  the  effects  of  cosmic  ray  and  solar  flux  variations  using  purely 
statistical  approaches.  As  mentioned  in  Section  3.1,  cosmic  ray  intensity  in  the 
atmosphere is in antiphase with solar activity, but the 10.7cm solar flux is an indicator of 
total solar irradiance, and is greater at solar maximum. Cosmic ray intensity at Earth and 
solar  activity  indicators  are  therefore  closely  inversely  correlated.  This  is  illustrated  in 
Figure 5, in which, following van Loon and Labitzke (2000), correlations with the 30hPa 
geopotential  height  are  compared  for  1958-1998.  Figure  5a)  reproduces  the  results  in 
Figure 3 of van Loon and Labitzke (2000), for the spatial correlation variation between 
the 10.7cm solar flux and the 30hPa height. In Figure 5b), the pressure corrected monthly 

 

6

surface  neutron  counts  from  the  University  of  Chicago's  monitor  at  Climax  are  used 
instead. Figure 5a) and Figure 5b) are, as expected, inversely correlated, although there 
are small differences in position of the regions of high correlation. The magnitude of the 
correlation  between  neutron  counts  and  geopotential  height  is  also  slightly  greater.  In 
each case there are physical reasons for expecting a correlation: the UV component of the 
solar  irradiance  is  thought  to  modulate  stratospheric  dynamic  processes  through  ozone 
changes (Haigh, 2003). Detailed theoretical predictions for both postulated mechanisms 
are needed to distinguish between the solar flux and cosmic ray effects. 

 

6. Conclusions 
 

 

Two  assumptions  about  cosmic  rays  are  frequently  made  in  considering 
relationships  between  atmospheric  ionisation  and  meteorological  processes.  The  first 
assumption is that surface neutron counts are a good proxy for the atmospheric ionisation 
rate.  Analysis  of  historical  data  comparing  the  neutron  counter  and  ionisation  chamber 
responses  on  a  plane  flying  over  geomagnetic  latitudes  of  10-50º  indicated  an 
approximately  linear  relationship  between  them.  This  readily  confirms  that  surface 
neutron  counts  can  be  used  as  a  proxy  for  ionisation  rate.  The  1950s  data  are  useful 
because  this  is  the  only  period  where  there  is  an  overlap  between  regular  cosmic  ray 
measurements by both neutron counters and ionisation chambers. It could be valuable for 
contemporary  studies  of  cosmic  ray  effects  in  the  atmosphere  to  be  able  to  calibrate 
surface  neutron  counts  to  the  integrated  ionisation  rate.  This  would  be  possible  by 
comparing,  for  example,  balloon  ascents  measuring  the  ionisation  rate  (Bazilevskaya, 
2000) with the colocated surface neutron count rate.  

The  second  assumption  is  that  the  modulation  of  cosmic  rays  detected  at  the 
surface  by  atmospheric  properties  can  be  ignored.  Physical  mechanisms  of  atmospheric 
effects on cosmic ray propagation, modulated by meteorological factors, were established 
by the 1940s, but are perhaps not well known to contemporary climate scientists. It has 
been shown in Sections 4 and 5, using both simple surface measurements, and reanalysis 
geopotential height data, that the pressure correction used at the Oulu neutron monitors 
does  not  completely  remove  meteorological effects on surface neutron counts. Some of 
the  variance  in  pressure  corrected  neutron  data  can  be  attributed  to  geopotential  height 
variations  affecting  the  properties  of  the  meson  producing  layer.  The  residual  effect  is 
small,  <1%,  but  may  be  highly  spatially  variable;  it  is  likely  to  be  greater  at  some 
locations.  This  is  supported  by  spatial  correlations  between  the  30hPa  and  100hPa 
geopotential  heights,  and  cosmic  rays  measured  at  the  Climax  neutron  monitor  station. 
Any mechanisms linking cosmic rays and climate may be similarly subtle and variable in 
magnitude; it is therefore necessary to understand what fraction of the variability remains 
from  the  effect  of  the  atmosphere  on  cosmic  rays,  before  quantifying  the  effects  of 
cosmic rays in the atmosphere. 
 
Globally  gridded  meteorological  reanalysis  data  are  now  routinely  and  freely 
available, and would benefit from broader use within the geophysical sciences. It would 
be  relatively  straightforward  to  retrieve  pressure  and  temperature  profiles  for  specific 
neutron  monitor  stations.  These  could  be  used  in  conjunction  with  Monte  Carlo 
simulations of the nucleonic cascade to correct for atmospheric effects on neutron counts

more  accurately.  Without  this  further  theoretical  work,  a  small  possibility  exists  that 
correlations found between solar and atmospheric parameters could include a component 
of the effects of the atmosphere on cosmic rays. However, the physical arguments based 
on ion-aerosol mechanisms appear generally persuasive.

Figure  1.  Variation  of  the  ion  production  rate  due  to  “penetrating  radiation”  with 
geomagnetic  latitude  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere.  Measurements  were  made  on  the 
Carnegie cruises IV (1915) and VI (1921). 

Figure  2.  Neutron  counter-ionisation  chamber  comparisons  a)  Calibration  of  one  of  the 
first  neutron  counters  at  9km,  over  10-50º  geomagnetic  latitude,  after  Simpson  (2000) 
and Biehl et al. (1949) b) Calibration of neutron monitor to ionisation chamber (IC) for 
1953-1957  c)  Time  series  of  Cheltenham  (USA)  ionisation  chamber  (Ahluwalia,  1997) 
and Climax neutron monitor. 

Figure 3. Comparison of pressure corrected and uncorrected neutron count data at Oulu 
for 2001, as a function of surface atmospheric pressure. 

Figure  4.  Correlations  between  monthly  averaged  Climax  corrected  neutron  data  and 
geopotential height over –10ºS to 60ºN and for 1000-10hPa, for longitudes 252.5-255ºE. 

Figure 5. Spatial correlations between 30hPa geopotential height, 1958-1998, and a) the 
10.7cm  solar  flux,  as  in  van  Loon  and  Labitzke  (2000),  b)  with  the  monthly  surface 
neutron counts from the Climax neutron counter.

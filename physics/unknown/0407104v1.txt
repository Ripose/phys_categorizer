Abstract: We demonstrate a new class of hollow-core Bragg fibers that are 
composed  of  concentric  cylindrical  silica  rings  separated  by  nanoscale 
support  bridges.  We  theoretically  predict  and  experimentally  observe 
hollow-core confinement over an octave frequency range. The bandwidth of 
bandgap  guiding  in  this  new  class  of  Bragg  fibers  exceeds  that  of  other 
hollow-core fibers reported in the literature. With only three rings of silica 
cladding layers, these Bragg fibers achieve propagation loss of the order of 
1 dB/m.

1. Introduction 
The  concept  of  hollow-core  Bragg  fibers,  in  which  the  fiber  cladding  is  composed  of 
cylindrical dielectric layers with alternating refractive indices (Fig. 1(a)), was first proposed in 
1978 [1]. More recently, Knight et al. and Cregan et al. demonstrated another class of hollow-
core  fibers,  namely  the  photonic  crystal  fibers,  where  the  cladding  structure  is  formed  by 
creating  a  two  dimensional  array  of  air  holes  in  a  high  index  material  [2-4].  In  both  cases, 
light is confined to a central hollow-core due to Bragg reflection from the periodic cladding 
structure.  With  little  overlap  between  the  propagating  modes  and  the  cladding  materials, 
hollow  core  fibers  are  ideal  for  applications  involving  high  optical  powers  [5,  6].  Other 
potential advantages include significantly reduced nonlinearity and lower propagation loss [7, 
8]. In addition, hollow core fibers also provide an attractive paradigm to study novel nonlinear 
optical phenomena in gas phase materials [9, 10].  

One  major  challenge  in  fabricating  Bragg  fibers  involves  the  identification  of  dielectric 
materials  with  not  only  a  large  index  contrast,  but  also  compatible  rheological  and  thermal 
properties.  In  this  paper,  we  report  a  new  class  of  Bragg  fibers  that  are  composed  of 
cylindrical dielectric layers in air, separated by nanoscale support bridges. Consequently, such 
Bragg fibers can be constructed from a single dielectric material such as a glass or a polymer. 
Furthermore,  they  have  the  unique  property  of  supporting  bandgap  guiding  over  an  octave 
frequency range, which is much larger than what has been achieved by any other hollow-core 
fiber [6, 7, 11-15]. Ideally, our theoretical calculations indicate that such hollow-core air-silica 
Bragg  fibers  can  achieve  confinement  loss  of  the  order  of  0.1 dB/km  with  only  four  silica 
cladding rings.  

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we theoretically analyze the properties of 
hollow-core air-silica Bragg fibers and demonstrate some  of the unique features of this new 
class  of  Bragg  fibers.  In  section  3,  we  discuss  the  fabrication  and  the  experimental 
characterization  of  the  hollow-core  air-silica  Bragg  fibers  in  some  details.  The  paper  is 
summarized in section 4.

Fig. 1. (a) Schematics of a hollow-core Bragg fiber. The refractive index and the thickness of 
the high (low) index cladding layer are respectively nh and Lh (nl and Ll). Photons zigzag within 
the hollow-core with an incident angle θ and form a propagating mode. ω/c is the vacuum wave 
vector. β is the propagation constant. (b) Under the asymptotic limit, the Bragg fiber cladding 
layers can be well approximated by a planar Bragg stack with the same parameters. The photon 
wave vectors (ω/c and β) also correspond to those shown in (a). 

 

In the asymptotic formalism in Refs. [15] and [16], the cladding field of a guided Bragg 
fiber mode can always be separated into a TE component and a TM component, which behave 
in  the  same  way  as  a  TE  field  and  TM  field  in  a  planar  Bragg  stack.  As  a  result,  the 
asymptotic  approach  allows  us  to  approximate  a  cylindrical  Bragg  fiber  as  a  planar  Bragg 
stack  with  the  same  material  composition  and  layer  thicknesses.  To  begin  our  analysis,  we 
consider  a  planar  Bragg  stack  with  NBragg  pairs  of  dielectric  layers,  where  each  Bragg  pair 
consists  of  a  high  index  layer  with  refractive  index  nh  and  thickness  Lh  followed  by  a  low 
index layer with refractive index nl and thickness Ll. In the high index layer of the Nth unit 
cell of the planar Bragg stack, the electric field of the TE mode takes the form of [15-17]:

It is well known that the field amplitudes (AN and BN) within a planar Bragg stack decay 
exponentially as a function of the Bragg stack unit cell number (N) [15, 17], which can also be 
inferred by repeatedly applying Eq. (3). As a result, the transmission coefficient T through the 
planar Bragg stack also depend exponentially on the number of Bragg stack layers NBragg (i.e. 
NDT ∝
), as demonstrated in Ref. [15]. Consequently, we can define the constant D as 
the leakage reduction factor, which characterizes how efficiently the Bragg stack reflects the 
incident light. Assuming an incident angle of θ (see Fig. 1), and that the ambient medium is 
air, we can minimize the Bragg stack transmission by choosing Lh and Ll such that they satisfy 
the quarter-wave condition [1]. Under these considerations, we can apply Eqs. (3) and (4), and 
use  the  analysis  in  Ref.  [15],  which  gives  the  leakage  reduction  factor  for  the  TE  incident 
wave as:

The previous analysis  demonstrates  that  intuitively,  we  can  regard  the guided  mode  in  a 
hollow-core Bragg fiber as composed of photons zigzagging within the central core and bound 
by the cladding Bragg stack, as illustrated in Fig. 1. At each reflection, a small amount of light 
passes through the Bragg cladding layers, which results in the finite loss of the Bragg fiber. 
Therefore,  the  problem  of  constructing  a  low  loss  Bragg  fiber  is  equivalent  to  finding  the 
planar Bragg stack with the highest possible reflection. Most hollow-core Bragg fibers in the 
literature have cladding structures with a large index contrast between nh and nl [5, 6, 13, 15], 
which according to Eqs. (5) and (6) can effectively reduce the leakage through the cladding 
and  thus  the  fiber  propagation  loss.  However,  a  more  efficient  leakage  reduction  can  be 
realized  if  the  light  incidence  angle  θ  is  near  90º  and  the  low  index  Bragg  material  is  air 

1=ln
). From Eq. (1), it is clear that in this case the leakage reduction factors DTE and DTM 
(
are no longer limited by the index contrast of the Bragg stack, and can be arbitrarily small as θ 
approaches  90º.  Consequentially,  we  expect  that  this  new  class  of  Bragg  fibers,  where  both 
the  fiber  core  and  the  low  index  cladding  layers  are  composed  of  air,  can  lead  to  a 
substantially better light confinement than what can be achieved in conventional Bragg fibers 
[5, 6, 13-16].  

 

 

Fig. 2. In (a) and (b), we respectively give the loss and dispersion of the TE01, TM01, and MP11 
mode of a Bragg fiber with four cladding pairs, where we use nh=1.45, Lh=0.37µm, nl=1.0, 
Ll=4.10µm. The shaded area in (b) indicates the existence of propagating modes in the fiber 
cladding. 

In the following, we consider a specific Bragg fiber with a hollow-core radius of 10 µm. 
The  fiber  cladding  is  formed  by  four  silica  layers  with  a  refractive  index  of  1.45  and  a 
thickness of 0.37 µm, separated by air layers (nl = 1) with a thickness of 4.10 µm. In practice, 
support  bridges  must  be  introduced  to  separate  the  adjacent  silica  rings.  However,  if  the 
support bridge thickness is much smaller than the optical wavelength of interest, we can, to a 
good  approximation,  neglect  their  presence  and  regard  the  region  between  the  high  index 
silica layers as composed entirely of air. Using an asymptotic method [15, 16], we calculate 
the  dispersion  and  the  loss  of  the  fundamental  TE  mode  (TE01),  the  fundamental  TM  mode 
(TM01), and the fundamental MP mode with l=1 (MP11) in the fiber. In labeling these modes, 
the  first  subscript  gives  the  azimuthal  quantum  number  l,  and  the  second  subscript  n 
distinguishes confined modes with the same l but different propagation constant. The value of 
n=1 designates the fundamental mode, which is closest to the light line. The results are shown 
in Fig. 2. One of the most striking features of Fig. 2(a) is that with only four silica layers, the 
fiber  propagation  loss  can  be  reduced  to  less  than  0.1 dB/km.  Furthermore,  the  Bragg  fiber 
supports low loss modes (less than 1 dB/m) in the wavelength range of 0.82 µm to 2.86 µm, 
almost two octaves in frequency range. To the best of our knowledge, no other hollow-core 
fiber [6, 7, 11-15] or photonic crystal waveguide [18-20] in the literature can support bandgap 
guiding  over  such  a  wide  frequency  range.    Fig.  2(b)  shows  the  band  diagram  and  the 
dispersion of the TE01, MP11, and TM01 modes for the Bragg fiber under consideration. The 
bandgap region extends from 0.8 µm to over 3.2 µm, a necessary condition for the ultra-large 
bandwidth guiding observed in Fig. 2(a). The modal dispersions shown in Fig. 2(b) are very 
flat,  (especially  that  of  the  MP11  mode),  which  makes  this  hollow-core  Bragg  fiber  very 

attractive  for  applications  requiring  minimal  signal  distortion,  such  as  the  transmission  of 
ultrafast optical pulses.  

 

3. Experimental Results 

To fabricate the hollow-core air-silica Bragg fibers, we use silica as the high index material, 
and employ a stack-and-draw method. An outer tube is filled with three tubes of decreasing 
sizes  and  a  constant  distance  between  the  adjacent  tubes.  Within  the  annular  gap,  thin 
capillaries are introduced and evenly distributed. The outer, middle, and inner gaps are filled 
with 46, 35, and 24 capillaries, respectively. The stack of tubes and capillaries are drawn to a 
preform cane, which is subsequently pulled to fibers of different outer diameters (OD), of 120, 
115, 110, 105, 100, 90, and 80 µm, respectively. For each fiber, the total length is more than 
150m,  throughout  which  the  OD  is  controlled  within  two  microns.  In  the  following,  we 
identify  different  fibers  by  their  OD.  With  this  fabrication  procedure,  the  seven  fibers  have 
similar structures, except for the overall scaling factors determined by their OD. 

 

Fig. 3. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the OD90 sample cross-section. In 
(a) and (b), we respectively show the image of the overall structure and the cladding structure. 

 
Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) of the gold-coated OD90 sample 
facet. The three silica cladding layers can be well represented by concentric rings. The radius 
of the entire microstructure is approximately 17.5 µm, with a hollow core of 10 µm radius at 
its center. From the SEMs, the thickness of support bridges between adjacent silica layers is 
determined to be in the range of 60 nm to 80 nm. Assuming mass conservation throughout the 

 

fiber pulling process, we estimate  the support bridge thickness to be in the range of 45 nm, 
which is in reasonable agreement with the results obtained from SEMs.

µm samples. (b) The experimental mode profile in the OD90 sample at a wavelength of 1060 
nm. (c) The image of the output facet of the OD105 sample with white light input. 

We measure the Bragg fiber transmission properties by launching light from a broadband 
source  into  a  large  mode  area  (LMA)  photonic  crystal  fiber  (mode  field  diameter  8 µm), 
which  is  subsequently  butt-coupled  into  the  hollow-core  Bragg  fiber.  The  light  transmitted 
through  the  Bragg  fiber  is  fed  into  a  spectrum  analyzer.  A  Tungsten-Halogen  white  light 
source  is  used  as  the  broadband  source  that  covers  the  wavelength  range  of  400 nm  to 
1750 nm, and the spectra are taken with an optical spectrum analyzer (ANDO 6315E). Within 
the  wavelength  range  of  1750 nm  to  2150 nm,  we  use  an  ultra  broadband  light  source  (TB-
1550,  MenloSystems)  and  record  the  transmission  spectra  with  a  FT-IR  spectrometer  (Oriel 
MIR 8000 and DTGS detector). We choose the LMA fiber because it supports single mode 
propagation  over  the  whole  measurement  range.  In  Fig.  4(a),  we  show  the  transmission 
spectra  of  seven  40  cm  long  fiber  samples,  normalized  with  respect  to  a  reference 
measurement where only the LMA fiber is used. As expected, the fiber transmission window 
scales towards lower wavelength as the fiber OD decreases. Furthermore, we observe that all 
seven  fiber  samples  support  hollow-core  guiding  over  approximately  an  octave  frequency 
range, in accord with our previous theoretical discussions. For example, the OD90 fiber shows 
a  broad  transmission  window  that  lies  between  0.75 µm  and  1.7 µm.  In  order  to  verify  the 
existence of hollow-core confined  modes, we launch light from a laser  source into the fiber 
hollow-core  and  record  the  mode  profile  at  the  output  facet  with  an  infrared  camera 
(Hamamatsu  C2400).  In  Fig.  4(b),  we  show  the  experimental  modal  profile  of  the  OD90 
sample  at  a  wavelength  of  1060  nm.  The  numerous  isolated  small  “islands”  of  light 
transmission are due to the index guiding at the intersection between the silica rings and the 
silica nano-supports, and are excited to provide visual indication for the position of the silica 
rings.  The  transmission  spectra  in  Fig.  4(a)  also  indicate  the  presence  of  a  higher  order 
bandgap,  which  is  manifested  by  the  small  transmission  peak  around  580 nm  in  the  case  of 
OD105  sample.  The  existence  of  a  higher  order  bandgap  can  also  be  inferred  by  launching 
white  light  into  the  Bragg fiber  core  and observing  the near-field  images  at  the  fiber output 

facet. The near-field image for the OD105 sample is shown in Fig. 4(c), which is dominated 
by yellow color, as one would expect from the transmission spectrum. 

 

Fig. 5. The theoretical loss (a) and dispersion (b) of the TE01, TM01, and MP11 mode in the 
OD90 sample. In calculations, we use a hollow-core radius of 10 µm (determined from SEM 
micrographs). The thicknesses of the inner, middle, and outer air layers are approximately 2.40, 
2.27, and 2.27 µm, respectively. The thicknesses of inner, middle, and outer silica rings are 
0.22, 0.28, and 0.28 µm, respectively. In calculating the cladding band diagram in (b), we 
assume the thickness of the silica and the air layers to be 0.28 µm and 2.27 µm, respectively. 
The shaded region in (b) indicates the existence of propagating modes in the fiber cladding 
layers. 

To better understand the spectral features in Fig. 4(a), we calculate the modal loss of the 
OD90 fiber and compare theoretical results with experimental measurements. From SEMs, we 
determine that the hollow-core radius is 10 µm. The thicknesses of the inner, the middle, and 
the  outer  air  layers  are  approximately  2.40 µm,  2.27 µm,  and  2.27 µm,  respectively.  The 
dimension of the silica rings, on the other hand, can have noticeable azimuthal variation. For 
the innermost silica ring, where the thickness can change from 0.14 µm to 0.28 µm, we take 
an average value of 0.22 µm as its thickness. Similarly, we determine that the middle and the 
outer silica rings are approximately 0.28 µm thick. The parameters for the outer two silica/air 
cladding  pairs  are  the  same,  and  are  used  to  obtain  the  band  diagram  for  the  cladding 
structure. The loss and the dispersion of the TE01, MP11, and TM01 modes are calculated using 
the asymptotic approach [15, 16]. The results are shown, together with the band diagram of 
the  cladding  structure,  in  Fig.  5. We  immediately  notice  that  theoretical  calculations predict 
that  the  fundamental  transmission  window  covers  the  wavelength  range  from  0.6 µm  up  to 
approximately  1.8 µm,  in  reasonable  agreement  with  the  experimental  results  for  the  OD90 
fiber (Fig. 4(a)). Furthermore, our calculations predict the second order bandgap to be around 
500 nm, which also agrees well with the experimental observation.   

The  propagation  loss  of  the  hollow-core  Bragg  fiber  can  be  determined  through  a 
cutback method.  In the  measurement,  we  minimize  the  impact of  index-guiding modes 
(as shown in Fig. 4(b)) by tuning the coupling of the input light such that the transmitted 
light is focused entirely within the hollow core. From the cutback measurement of a 50-m-
long  fiber,  we  find  that  the  loss  of  the  OD120  sample  is  approximately  1.5  dB/m  at  a 
wavelength  of  1.4  µm,  where  the  transmission  spectrum  reaches  its  peak.  With  only  three 

rings of silica layers, the loss of the hollow-core Bragg fiber compares favorably with that of 
the  Bragg  fiber  reported  in  Ref.  [6],  which  has  nine  Bragg  cladding  pairs  and  has  a 
transmission  loss  approximately  1 dB/m  at  the  wavelength  of  10.6 µm.  We  notice  that  the 
experimentally measured loss is higher than what one expects from the theoretical results in 
Fig. 5(a). Since the theoretical values represent the lower limit where the fiber is longitudinal 
uniform  and  cylindrically  symmetric,  the  measured  fiber  loss  is  likely  dominated  by  the 
scattering  induced  by  the  non-uniformity  of  the  fiber  cladding  structures.  The  same  non-
uniformity  may  also  explain  the  presence  of  the  sharp  variations  in  the  experimental 
transmission spectra in Fig. 4(a) [7]. The higher measured fiber loss can also be induced by 
the  finite  thickness  of  the  support  bridges  between  the  adjacent  silica  rings,  which 
breaks  the  cylindrical  symmetry  of  the  structure  and  cannot  be  taken  into  account  by 
the asymptotic approach. However, we can lower the excessive loss by further reducing 
the thickness of the silica support bridges.  

In  this  paper,  the  transmission  window  of  the  hollow  core  Bragg  fiber  is  located 
within the near infrared range, with the peak transmission wavelength between 900 nm 
and  1550  nm.  As  a  result,  we  can  ignore  the  loss  of  the  silica  glass  and  assume  its 
refractive  index  to  be  real.  By  increasing  the  overall  dimension  of  the  fiber 
microstructure, we can easily move the transmission window of the Bragg fiber into the 
middle  infrared  or  even  far  infrared  range.  However,  since  the  material  absorption  of 
the  silica  glass  can  be  very  large  for  the  longer  optical  wavelength,  we  need  to  use  a 
complex refractive index for the silica glass to calculate the fiber propagation loss. We 
can achieve more efficient hollow-core guiding in the longer wavelength by replacing the 
silica glass with a low loss polymeric material.    

 

4. Summary 

In summary, we have demonstrated a new class of hollow-core Bragg fibers that requires only 
a  single  dielectric  material.  Such  Bragg  fibers  have  been  fabricated  using  a  stack  and  draw 
method.  With  only  three  rings  of  silica  cladding  layers,  we  experimentally  demonstrated 
bandgap  guiding  throughout  an  octave  frequency  range,  with  the  lowest  loss  at  the  level  of 
1 dB/m. Performance of this new class of hollow-core Bragg fibers can be further enhanced 
by decreasing the thickness of the nanoscale support bridges, improving the uniformity of the 
cylindrical  silica  rings,  and  adding  more  silica  cladding  layers.  By  scaling  the dimension  of 
the  Bragg  fiber  appropriately  and  using  other  dielectric  materials,  we  may  achieve  hollow-
core guiding in other wavelength ranges of interests, such as ultraviolet, mid-infrared or even 
far-infrared. With the appealing properties described above, we expect that this new type of 
hollow-core  Bragg  fibers  will  find  many  applications  in  diverse  areas  such  as  optical 
communication,  delivery  of  high  power  laser  radiation,  spectroscopy,  nonlinear  optics, 
ultrafast optics, medicine, and biology.

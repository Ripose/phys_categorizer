ABSTRACT

Here I introduce the model in an attempt to describe the underlying

reasons of attraction and repulsion forces between two physical bodies. Both

electrical and gravitational forces are considered. Results are based on the

technique developed in the Dual Time-Space Model of Wave Propagation.

Keywords: Wave Equation, Field Theory

Introduction

Developed recently [1] the Dual Time-Space Model of Wave Propagation

(DTSMWP) proved to be a useful tool in investigating the wave nature of matter.

In present paper the model is applied to the phenomena of attraction and

repulsion forces between physical bodies, which constitutes the subject of the

field theory [2].

2.

Model Assumptions

According to [1], the DTSMWP has the following assumptions.

In the time domain,

(1) 

The second derivative of energy’s value with respect to time is inversely

proportional to energy’s disturbance.

(2) 

The first derivative of energy’s level with respect to time is directly

proportional to energy’s disturbance.

In the space domain,

(3) 

The second derivative of energy’s value with respect to direction is

inversely proportional to energy’s disturbance.

(4) 

The first derivative of energy’s level with respect to direction is directly

proportional to energy’s disturbance.

I also assume that energy’s level was initially stable,

                                                                  (2)

Then according to [1], we have the propagation of energy’s disturbance in

space.

Therefore we can write

level decreases in the space domain and retains the same sign.

Compact Energy Body at Rest

Consider we have two jumps of the energy’s values as follows,

and the energy’s level was initially at rest,

Φ

(
)
=
Utx
,

0

for

t

<

0

and

∀
x

.

                                                                  (6)

We assume that compact energy body lies at rest within 

≤≤
x

x

x

.

We can conclude from [1] that there are forces 

)txF
(
,1

 and 

)txF
(
,2

applied respectively to the points 

1x  and 

2x  of compact body with the following

magnitudes,

(
txF

)

=

where  τ≥t

, and 

0>µ  is  a constant.

To balance these forces we have to complement them with the opposite

forces 

( )
1xF ′

 and 

(
2xF ′

)

, therefore for 

0>t

(

Note that forces 

)txF
(
,1

 and 

)txF
(
,2

 act in the direction of disturbance

propagation, and forces 

( )
1xF ′

 and 

(

 act in the opposite direction.

Impact of Energy’s Discrepancy on Compact Energy Body

Let me consider three points of interest where we have the jumps of

energy’s values,

                                     (9)

and the energy’s level was initially at rest,

Φ

(
)
=
Utx
,

0

for

t

<

0

and

∀
x

.

                                                                (10)

We assume that the compact energy body lies at rest until the energy’s

disturbance from point 

0x  reaches the point 

1x  of compact body at time 

1t

τ>

.

Let me describe the forces applied to the point 

1x  of compact body at the

time 

t

∆+=
t
1

t

.

At first I will consider the case when magnitudes of energy’s disturbances

are close to each other, i.e. 

∆

E

0

∆≈

E
1

, that causes inequality 

∆

( )

xE
1
0

∆<

E
1

.

There are four possible situations.

(a)

∆ E

0

>

0

, 

∆ E

1

>

0

(

(

)

=

( )

xF
1

.            (11)

Therefore the value of force 

, that has a direction inside the

( )
1xF ′

compact body, exceeds the value of an opposite force 

(
1,
txF

1

∆+

)t

, and two

bodies are repulsed.

(

)

=

( )

xF

.            (12)

Therefore the bodies are attracted.

(c)

∆ E

0

, 

∆ E

<

0

Therefore the bodies are attracted.

(d)

∆ E

0

∆ E

(

1

)

=

( )
′
xF
1

.             (14)

Therefore the bodies are repulsed.

Thus we have described so far the forces of electrical attraction and

repulsion.

Now I will consider the case when 

∆

E

0

∆>>

>

E
1

0

. From here we have an

inequality 

∆

( )

xE
1
0

∆⋅>
2

E

0

, that as we can see soon, creates the force of

gravitational attraction,

∆⋅=∆+

(

)

=

( )

xF
1

.              (15)

Hence the bodies are attracted.

Abstract 

 
It is demonstrated that for spatial dimensions n ≥ 6, stable gravitational or 
electrostatic  atoms  cannot  be  bound  by  energy  constraints.    For  3  <  n  <  6  ,  the 
atoms are only metastable since the finite width of the effective potential energy  
barrier  permits  the  orbiting  body  to  tunnel  out.    Thus  both  Kaluza  Klein  theory 
and  string  theory  may  be  impacted  since  it  appears  that  the  unfurled  higher 
dimensions  of  string  theory  will  not  permit  the  existence  of  energetically  stable 
atoms.    This  also  has  bearing  on  the  search  for  deviations  from  1/r2  of  the 
gravitational  force  at  mm  distances.    Since  the  results  here  also  apply  to  the 
electrostatic force, this  implies that such a deviation must be smaller than ~ 10-8 
cm, since atoms would be unstable if the curled up dimensions were larger than 
this.  
 
1.  Introduction 
 
A  framework  combining  hierarchy  theory  (Dirac  1937,  1938)  and  string 
theory  was  proposed  by  postulating  the  existence  of  2  or  more  compact 
dimensions  in  addition  to  the  standard  3  spatial  dimensions  that  we  commonly 
experience (Argyres, Dimopoulos, and  March-Russell, 1998). In this view, gravity 
is  strong  on  a  scale  with  the  higher-dimensional  compacted  space,  and  only 
manifests  itself  as  being  weak  on  a  larger  3-dimensional  scale.  One  prediction 
(Arkani-Hamed  et  al,  1998)  is  that  if    there  are  only  2  compacted  dimensions  of 
radius rc ~ 10-2 cm, it should be possible to detect a deviation of the Newtonian 
1/r2  force law.   
 

It  will  be  shown  in  this  paper  that  for      rc  <  ~  10-8  cm,  common 
electrostatically  bound  atoms  will  not  be  stable.    For  convenience  in  using 
previously  derived  results,  the  analysis  here  will  be  done  for  gravitationally 
bound atoms (Rabinowitz, 1990, 2001).  However, the same results are obtained if 
 REn is a model dependent length factor 
GnMm is replaced by   
that relates the electrical force in the nth dimension to the electrical force in the (n 
- 1) dimension, and ε  is the permittivity of free space. 
 
2.  Quantized two-body, M>>m, Atoms in n-Space 
 
Without  going  through  a  complete  derivation  again,  we  can  use  as  our 
starting  point  the  previously  derived  semi-classical  results  for  circular  orbits

 Note  from  equation  (2.1)  that  all  energy  levels  are  ≥  0  in  4  and  higher 
 
dimensional space, yielding a general result that orbiting bodies in gravitational 
atoms cannot be bound by energy constraints in higher dimensions.  As we shall 
see,  this  is  a  general  result  and  non-circular  orbits  would  not  change  this 
conclusion  no  matter  how  strong  the  gravitational  interaction.  This  is  also  true 
for  electrostatically  bound  atoms  since  they  have  the  same  dependence  on  n.  
This may impact string theory if short-range forces or other constraints cannot be 
invoked to achieve stability when the extra dimensions are unfurled..  
 
Mathematically  this  results  from  the  leading  factor  [(n-4)/(n-2)]  in  the 
complicated quantized equation (2.2). Why n > 3 leads to  En ≥ 0, can be under-
stood in simpler terms. For a long-range attractive force like gravity with M >> m

3.  Higher Dimensional Non-Circular Orbits 
 
 
In higher dimensional space, central force trajectories are generally neither 
circular,    nor  elliptical,  as  the  orbits  become  non-closed  transcendental  curves.  
Although only circular orbis have been considered, the more complicated central 
force  problem  where  there  is  also  a  radial  velocity,  yields  the  same  conclusion.  
Rather  than  considering    En < 0 ,  we  must  take  into  consideration  the  effective 
potential  energy.  The  general  case  can  be  put  in  the  form  of  a  one-dimensional 
radial problem in terms of the effective potential energy of the system,  
      
 
.   
    (3.1) 
   = jh  is  the  quantized 
where  Vn(r)  is  the  potential  energy  of  the  system,  and  L
angular  momentum  which  remains  constant  because  there  are  no  torques  in 
central force motion.

for which

orbiting body to tunnel out.

An  argument  can  also  be  made  that  does  not  rely  on  tunneling.    The

This is the radius for a circular orbit.  Trajectories with r >  ro are clearly unbound 
both  classically  and  quantum  mechanically.    Orbits  with  r  <  ro  are  bound 
classically.   
 
for n > 3,  

We will next see if orbits with r < ro are unbound quantum mechanically

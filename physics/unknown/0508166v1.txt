Abstract

Theoretical and numerical wave propagation analysis of an oscillating electric dipole is presented. The
results  show  that  upon  creation  at  the  source,  both  the  longitudinal  electric  and  transverse  magnetic
fields  propagate  superluminally  and  reduce  to  the  speed  of  light  as  they  propagate  about  one
wavelength  from  the  source.  In  contrast,  the  transverse  electric  field  is  shown  to  be  created  about
1/4 wavelength outside the source and launches superluminal fields  both  towards  and  away  from  the
source which reduce to the speed of light as the field propagates about one wavelength from the source.
An experiment using simple dipole antennas is shown to verify the predicted superluminal transverse
electric  field  behavior.  In  addition,  it  is  shown  that  the  fields  generated  by  a  gravitational  source
propagate  superluminally  and  can  be  modeled  using  quadrapole  electrodynamic  theory.  The  phase
speed,  group  speed,  and  information  speed  of  these  systems  are  compared  and  shown  to  differ.
Provided  the  noise  of  a  signal  is  small  and  the  modulation  method  is  known,  it  is  shown  that  the
information  speed  can  be  approximately  the  same  as  the  superluminal  group  speed.  According  to
relativity theory, it is known that between moving reference frames, superluminal signals can propagate
backwards  in  time  enabling  violations  of  causality.  Several  explanations  are  presented  which  may
resolve this dilemma.

Introduction

The  electromagnetic  fields  generated  by  an  oscillating  electric  dipole  have  been
theoretically studied by many researchers using Maxwell’s equations and are known
to yield the following well-known results (MKS units):

Phase speed analysis

Phase speed can be defined as the speed at which a wave composed of one frequency
propagates.  The  phase  speed  (cph)  of  an  oscillating  field  of  the  form  Sin t

It should be noted that other derivations of the above phase and group speed relations
are available in previous publications by the author [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and in the
following well-known reference [14].

In addition, in order for the group speed to be valid, a signal should not distort as it
propagates. It is known from electronic signal theory that in order to minimize signal
distortion,  the  phase  vs.  frequency  curve  must  be  approximately  linear  over  the
bandwidth of the signal and the amplitude vs. frequency curve must be approximately
constant over the bandwidth of the signal [15]. It is shown below that the amplitude
vs.  frequency  curve  can  even  be  approximately  linear  over  the  bandwidth  of  the
signal,  provided  the  ratio  of  the  slope  of  the  curve  to  the  signal  amplitude  is  small.
Assuming  that  the  amplitude  vs.  frequency  curve  is  increasing  and  approximately
linear  over  the  bandwidth  of  a  modulated  carrier  signal,  each  signal  magnitude  (A)
Fourier  component  (wm)  will  be  increased  by  (u)  and  the  Fourier  component
symmetric about the carrier (wc) will be reduced by (u):

provided  the  amplitude  vs.  frequency  curve  is  approximately  linear  over  the

Given two different frequencies, plots of the phase speed and group speed can then be
determined  for  each  field  component  by  inserting  the  corresponding  phase  relation
(Eq.  17,  20,  23).  It  should  be  noted  that  these  relations  yield  the  same  results  as
(Eq. 8, 12) provided the phase and magnitude vs. frequency curves are approximately
linear over the bandwidth of the signal.

Wave propagation analysis of near-field electric dipole EM fields 

To determine how the EM fields propagate in an electric dipole system, one can apply
the  above  phase  and  group  speed  relations  (Eq.  8,  12)  to  the  known  theoretical
solution of an electric dipole (Eq. 4).

The above results (p.4) were originally published by the author in 1999 [10], but the
propagation  of  the  longitudinal electric  field  and  gravitational  field  next  to  a  source
was published earlier by the author in 1997 [12, 13]. It should be noted that after these
dates similar results have been published by other authors [16, 17].

Numerical verification of field component propagation

To  verify  the  predicted  wave  propagation  effects,  a  numerical  simulation  was
performed.  The  simulation  consisted  of  extracting  the  transfer  function  from  the
various  field  components  of  the  known  dipole  solution  (Eq.  4)  and  then  inverse
Fourier transforming (FT-1) the Fourier transform (FT) of a given signal multiplied by
the  dipole  transfer  function  [18]:    Result  Sig  =  FT-1 [ FT [Signal] x G ],    where
"Result Sig" is the resultant propagating signal  as  a  function  of  time,  and  "G"  is  the
transfer  function  of  the  wave  propagation  system.  A  simple  amplituded  modulated
signal  (300MHz  carrier,  20MHz  modulation),  generated  by  adding  together  two
sinusoidal  oscillations  (280MHz  and  320MHz),  was  applied  as  an  input  signal.  The
simulations  yielded  propagating  signal-versus-time  animations  as  a  function  of
distance  (r)  from  the  source.  To  compare  the  resulting  simulations  to  theoretical
expectations, a propagating modulation envelope of the AM signal was superimposed:
Mod = Cos[wmt-(θ2-θ1)/2]  where q1 and q2 are the theoretically expected phase shifts
for the 2 frequencies used to create the AM signal (Eq. 17, 20, 23). The results below
show a very good match between theory and numerical simulation.

To check the simulator, the AM signal was also applied to a light propagating system.
The  results  yielded  a  300  MHz  carrier,  20  MHz  modulated  AM  signal  animation
which linearly increased its phase shift as expected. This was verified by substituting
the following known relations:

h=y*Exp[I*u*r];     (* FT [Signal] x G *)
Md=2*Cos[wm*tn-( k2*r - k1*r)/2];     (* Theoretical cg plot *)

It  should  be  noted  that  no  signal  distortion  was  observed  in  these  simulations.  This
can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the  phase  and  amplitude  vs.  frequency  curves  are
approximately  linear  over  the  bandwidth  of  the  signal  (∆f/fc  =  40/300  =  1/7.5).  The
use of linearity constraint can be seen to be justified by plotting u2/A2 for each field
component and noting that it is much less than one over the bandwidth of the signal
(Eq. 13 - 15).

Because of the excellent match between the numerical and theoretical methods, the
validity of both methods is confirmed in analyzing the propagation of simple signals
in this system. Whereas the theoretical method enables the propagation of simple
signals to be clearly understood, the numerical solution is not only useful in verifying
the theoretical results, it can also be useful in understanding the propagation of more
complex signals which may be difficult to analyze mathematically.

Experimental verification of Eθ solution

A  simple  experimental  setup  using  two  dipole  antennas,  a  437 MHz  (68.65 cm
wavelength),  2 watt  sinusoidal  transmitter,  and  a  500MHz  digital  oscilloscope  has
been developed to verify qualitatively the transverse electric field phase vs. distance
plot  predicted  from  standard  EM  theory  (Eq. 20,  Fig. 5).  The  phase  shift  of  the
received antenna signal (Rx) relative to the transmitted signal (Tx) was measured with
an oscilloscope as the distance between the antennas (rel) was changed from 5 cm to
70 cm in increments of 5 cm. The data was then curve fit with a 3rd order polynomial.
The phase speed vs. distance curve was then generated by differentiating the resultant
curve  fit  equation  with  respect  to  space  and  using  (Eq.  8).  The  group  speed  vs.
distance curve was generated by using the differential relation: 

∆=∆

  and inserting it into the relation (Eq. 12):                        where: Dw = Dk c

Other wave propagation systems with similar superluminal behavior

Magnetic dipole

Theoretical analysis of a magnetic dipole reveals that the system is governed by the
same  partial  differential  equation  as  the  electric  dipole  with  the  E  and  B  fields
interchanged  [2,  4].  The  resulting  fields  are  found  to  be  the  same  as  the  fields
generated by an electric dipole (Eq. 4) and therefore the phase speed and group speed
of  these  fields  are  the  same  as  (Eq. 18 - 25), except  that  the  E  and  B  fields  are
interchanged.

Electric and magnetic quadrapole

Using  the  same  method  of  analysis  as  was  done  for  the  electric  dipole,  the  scalar
potential for an electric quadrapole is found to be [3]:

The  fields  for  a  magnetic  quadrapole  are  also  the  same,  with  the  E  and  B  fields
interchanged. The phase and group speed of these fields can be determined using the
relations (Eq. 8, 12). These results are presented in the next section (Eq. 39 - 47).

Gravitational quadrapole

For  weak  and  slowly  varying  gravitational  fields,  Einstein’s  equation  becomes
linearized and reduces to [19, 20]:

                   

2
V

                                                                         (33)

V

Where:   ρ = Mass density

V = Gravitational potential
G = Gravitational constant

∇2  = Laplacian
c = Speed of light
t = Time

Except for the source term, the partial differential equation of the potential is the same
as that of an oscillating charge (Eq. 1). Because of this similarity one can then use the
oscillating  charge  solutions  by  simply  substituting: εo = –1/(4πG).  In  addition,
because  momentum  is  conserved,  a  moving  mass  must  push  off  another  mass.  The
gravitational  field  generated  by  the  secondary  mass  adds  to  the  gravitational  fields
generated  by  the  moving  mass,  resulting  in  a  linear  quadrapole  source.  The
gravitational fields generated by an oscillating mass are therefore of the same form as
the fields generated by an electric quadrapole (Eq. 28 - 32).

It is known that for weak and slowly varying gravitational fields, General Relativity
theory  reduces  to  a  form  of  Maxwell’s  equations  [19].  The  fields  can  then  be
calculated using the following relations:

where (E) is the gravitational force vector and (B) is the solenoidal gravitational force
vector.  The  constant  (N)  can  be  determined  by  substituting 
the  relations:
εo = –1/(4πG)  and  q  =  m  into  the  value  of  (N)  used  in  the  electric  quadrapole.  In
addition,  this  result  can  be  checked  by  looking  at  the  static  quadrapole  solution  and
comparing it to the above solutions in the limit (kr → 0). The results yield:

The phase and group speed relations for these fields can then be determined by using
the phase and group speed equations derived earlier in the paper (Eq. 8, 12). It should
be  noted  that  all  of  the  plots  look  very  similar  to  those  of  an  electric  dipole
(see page 4).

Total E field plots (linear quadrapole in center and vertical unless specified)

Using  vector  field  plot  graphics  in  Mathematica  software  [9],  the  Er  and  Eθ  can  be
combined and plotted as vectors (Fig. 35). A more detailed plot of the total E field can
be obtained by using the fact that a line element crossed with the electric field = 0. A
contour plot of the resulting relation yields the total E field plots below (Fig. 36 - 37).

Experimental evidence of superluminal gravitational fields

Evidence of infinite gravitational phase speed at zero frequency has been observed by
a  few  researchers  by  noting  the  high  stability  of  the  earth’s  orbit  about  the  sun
[21, 22]. Light from the sun is not observed to be collinear with the sun’s gravitational
force.  Astronomical  studies  indicate  that  the  earth’s  acceleration  is  towards  the
gravitational center of the sun even though it is moving around the sun, whereas light
from the sun is observed to be aberated. If the gravitational force between the sun and
the earth were aberated then gravitational forces tangential to the earth’s orbit would
result, causing the earth to spiral away from the sun, due to conservation of angular
momentum. Current astronomical observations estimate the phase speed of gravity to
be  greater  than  2x1010c.  Arguments  against  the  superluminal  interpretation  have
appeared in the literature [23, 24]

Information speed

If  an  amplitude-modulated  signal  propagates  a  distance  (d)  in  time  (t),  then  the
information contained in the modulation propagates at a speed:

cinf  = d/(t+T)                                                            (48)
where  (T)  is  the  amount  of  time  the  modulated  signal  must  pass  by  the  detector  in
order for the information to be determined. The information in the wave is determined
by measuring the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the wave modulation envelope. 

If a wave is propagated across distances in the farfield of the source, then the wave
information speed is approximately the same as the wave group speed. This is because
the  wave  propagation  time  (t)  is  much  greater  than  the  wave  information  scanning
time (T), consequently:   cinf = d/t = cg . 

In the nearfield of the source, if nothing is known about the type of modulation, then
the scanning time (T) can be much larger than the wave propagation time (t), thereby
making the wave information speed much less than the wave group speed. This can be
understood  by  noting  that  several  modulation  cycles  are  required  for  a  Fourier
analyzer  to  be  able  to  determine  the  wave  modulation  amplitude,  frequency,  and
phase.  But  if  the  type  of  modulation  is  known,  then  only  a  few  points  of  the
modulated signal need to be sampled by a detector in order to curve fit the signal and
therefore determine the modulation information. If the noise in the signal is very small
then  the  signal  scanning  time  (T)  can  be  made  much  smaller  than  the  signal
propagation time (t), consequently:   cinf ~ d/t = cg .

Relativistic consequences

According to the relativistic Lorentz time transform (Eq. 49), if an information signal
can propagate at a speed (w) faster than the speed of light (c), then the signal can be
reflected by a moving frame (v) located a distance (L) away and the signal will arrive
before the signal was transmitted (∆t´ < 0). Since the information in the signal can be
used  to  prevent  the  signal  from  being  transmitted,  this  results  in  a  logical
contradiction (violation of  causality). How can the signal be detected if it was never
transmitted? Consequently, Einstein in 1907 stated that superluminal signal velocities
are incompatible with Relativity theory [25].

Because Relativity theory predicts that a moving reflector (which has mass) can never
move faster than light (v < c), then in order for (∆t´ > 0) the signal propagation speed
must be less than the speed of light (w<c).

Argument against the superluminal interpretation

Some physicists have proposed that a dipole source generates position, velocity, and
acceleration-dependent  propagating  fields,  each  of  which  propagate  at  the  speed  of
light  [5,  26].  It  is  argued  that  the  interference  of  these  field  components  gives  the
illusion that they propagate superluminally. Although this is a plausible explanation it
is not clear that this is true. It can be shown using Maxwell’s equations that the fields
generated  by  a  dipole  source  can  be  modeled  by  two  coupled  partial  differential
equations in terms of the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential (A):

where  the  charges  and  currents  in  the  solutions  are  evaluated  at  a  previous  time
(retarded):  t - r/c. It is argued here that the Lorentz gauge is not the only gauge that
can be used to simplify the two PDEs. Many other gauges are possible including the
Coulomb  gauge  (
),  which  in  particular  is  known  to  yield  an  instantaneous
scalar potential [3(Ch 6.5)]. This shows that although the dipole solution is thought to
be  gauge  independent,  the  form  of  the  solution  may  differ  when  different  gauge
conditions are used, giving rise to different interpretations of the speed of the resulting
propagating  fields.  Only  the  PDE’s  (Eq.  50)  are  physical  in  EM  theory,  and  can
probably  only  be  solved  numerically  without  using  a  gauge  relation,  yielding  fields
that propagate as shown in this paper (see pages 4-6).

Conclusion

The analysis presented in this paper has shown that the fields generated by an electric
or  magnetic  dipole  or  quadrapole,  and  also  the  gravitational  fields  generated  by  a
quadrapole mass source, propagate superluminally in the nearfield of the source and
reduce to the speed of light as they propagate into the farfield. The group speed of the
waves  produced  by  these  systems  has  also  been  shown  to  be  superluminal  in  the
nearfield. Although information speed can be less than group speed in the nearfield, it
has been shown that if the method of modulation is known and provided the noise of
the  signal  is  small  enough,  the  information  can  be  extracted  in  a  time  period  much
smaller  than  the  wave  propagation  time.  This  would  therefore  result  in  information
speeds  only  slightly  less  than  the  group  speed  which  has  been  shown  to  be
superluminal  in  the  nearfield  of  the  source.  It  has  also  been  shown  that  Relativity
theory predicts that if an information signal can be propagated superluminally, then it

13

can  be  reflected  by  a  moving  frame  and  arrive  at  the  source  before  the  information
was transmitted, thereby enabling causality to be violated. 

Given  these  results,  it  is  at  present  unclear  how  to  resolve  this  dilemma.  Relativity
theory  could  be  incorrect,  or  perhaps  it  is  correct  and  information  can  be  sent
backwards  in  time.  Perhaps  as  suggested  by  the  ‘Hawking  chronology  protection
conjecture’ [27], nature will intervene in any attempt to use the information to change
the past. Therefore information can be propagated backwards in time but it cannot be
used  to  change  the  past,  thereby  preserving  causality.  Another  possibility  is  that
according  to  the  ‘many-worlds’  interpretation  of  quantum  mechanics  [28],  multiple
universes are created any time an event with several possible outcomes takes place. If
this  interpretation  is  correct,  then  information  can  be  transmitted  into  the  past  of
alternative  universes,  thereby  preserving  the  past  of  the  universe  from  which  the
signal was transmitted.

In addition to the theoretical implications of the research discussed above, it may also
have  practical  applications,  such  as  increasing  the  speed  of  electronic  systems  that
will soon be limited by light-speed-time delays. It should also be possible to reduce
the  time  delays  inherent  in  current  astronomical  observations  by  monitoring  lower
frequency EM and eventually gravitational radiation from these sources. Lastly, using
low  frequency  EM  transmissions,  it  should  be  possible  to  reduce  the  long
communication time delays to spacecraft.

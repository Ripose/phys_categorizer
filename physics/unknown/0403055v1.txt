Aging phenomena constitute one of the most complex and serious potential problems which could limit, or severely impair, 
the  use  of  gaseous  detectors  in  unprecedented  harsh  radiation  environments.  Long-term  operation  in  high-intensity 
experiments of the LHC-era not only demands extraordinary radiation hardness of construction materials and gas mixtures 
but  also  very  specific  and  appropriate  assembly  procedures  and  quality  checks  during  detector  construction  and  testing. 
Recent  experimental  data  from  hadron  beams  is  discussed.  It  is  shown  that  the  initial  stage  of  radiation  tests,  usually 
performed under isolated laboratory conditions, may not offer the full information needed to extrapolate to the long-term 
performance of real and full-size detectors at high energy physics facilities. Major factors, closely related to the capability 
of  operating  at  large  localized  ionization  densities,  and  which  could  lead  to  operation  instabilities  and  subsequent  aging 
phenomena  in  gaseous  detectors,  are  summarized.  Finally,  an  overview  of  aging  experience  with  state-of-the-art  gas 
detectors  in  experiments  with  low-  and  high-intensity  radiation  environments  is  given  with  a  goal  of  providing  a  set  of 
rules, along with some caveat, for the construction and operation of gaseous detectors in high luminosity experiments. 

1.  Introduction 

   Recent high energy physics experiments require development of radiation hard gaseous detectors able to 
withstand hadron fluences up to 1015 -1016 cm-2 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and at future very high 
luminosity colliders. Full functionality of large-area systems over the lifetime of an experiment in a harsh 
radiation  environment  is  of  a  prime  concern  to  the  involved  experimenters.  This  has  resulted  in  a  large 
research effort aimed at better understanding and improving the radiation hardness of existing proportional 
chambers  and  straw-type  detectors,  which  must  be  able  to  tolerate  considerable  rate  of  heavily  ionizing 
particles  and  dramatic  increase  in  the  charge  (up  to  1  C/cm/wire  per  year),  accumulated  on  the  sensing 
electrodes in the future high rate experiments. A new generation of more powerful Micro-Pattern Gaseous 
Detectors  (MPGD),  such  as  Gas  Electron  Multipliers  (GEM),  Micromegas  and  related  detector  types, 
which rapidly evolved with the introduction of microelectronic fabrication techniques, has very promising 
performances with increased reliability under harsh radiation conditions. The diversified research of their 
aging  properties  revealed  that  they  might  be  even  less  vulnerable  to  the  radiation-induced  performance 
degradation in the future high rate experiments than the standard silicon microstrip detectors. 
   The  achievements  of  past  R&D  projects  in  gas  detectors  are  excellently  summarized  in  [1-4],  new 
developments  in  the  radiation  damage  research  have  been  reviewed  at  the  ‘International  workshop  on 
Aging  Phenomena  in Gaseous  Detectors’ held  at DESY, Hamburg  in October, 2001  [5,6]. A great  effort 
has  resulted  in  the  optimization  and  construction  of  large  systems  of  gas  detectors  for  intense  hadron 
beams,  depending  on  the  need  for  the  best  spatial  resolution  (MPGD),  best  timing  resolution  for  trigger 
(Resistive  Plate  Chambers  (RPC),  MPGD),  high-rate  tracking  and  particle  identification  (straw-type 
detectors  and  multi-wire  proportional  chambers  (MWPC))  and  single  photon  detection  (CsI-GEM 
photodetectors).  The  paper  summarizes  wide  range  of  aging  tests,  aimed  at  increasing  reliability  and 
radiation hardness of gas detector technologies in view of their application in future high-energy physics 
experiments. 

2.  General Characteristics of Aging Phenomena in Wire Chambers 

    Aging  effects  in  wire  chambers,  a  permanent  degradation  of  operating  characteristics  under  sustained 
irradiation, has been and still remains a main limitation to the use of gas detectors in high energy physics

experiments  [7].  The  ‘classical  aging  effects’  are  the  result  of  chemical  reactions  occurring  in  avalanche 
plasma near anodes in wire chambers leading to formation of deposits on electrode surfaces [4,8]. During 
gas  avalanches  many  molecules  break  up  in  collisions  with  electrons,  de-excitation  of  atoms,  and  UV-
absorption processes. Whereas most ionization processes require electron energies greater than 10 eV, the 
breaking of covalent bonds and formation of free radicals requires only 3-4 eV, and can lead to a higher 
concentration of free radicals than that of ions in gaseous discharges. (Free radicals are unionized atomic or 
molecular species with one or more unsatisfied valence bonds). Consequently, free-radical polymerization 
is regarded as the dominating mechanism of wire chamber aging. Since free radicals are chemically very 
active they will either recombine to form the original molecules of other volatile species, or may start to 
form new cross-linked molecular structures of increasing molecular weight. In general, the rate of polymer 
formation  depends  upon  many  microscopic  variables  such  as  cross-sections  of  electron  and  photon 
processes  and  their  energy  distributions  in  gas  avalanches,  molecular  dissociation  energies  as  well  as 
densities of electrons, ions and free radicals. The ‘classical aging effects’ lead to the formation of deposits, 
conductive or insulating, on the electrode surfaces and manifest themselves as a decrease of the gas gain 
due to the modification of the electric field, excessive currents, sparking and self-sustained discharges. The 
radiation-induced  degradation  in  wire  chambers  is  sensitive  to  the  nature  and  purity  of  the  gas  mixture, 
different additives and trace contaminants, materials used in contact with the gas, materials of electrodes 
and configuration of electric field. In the following, several examples of ‘classical aging effects’, observed 
in  large  systems  at  ‘low  rates’  (collected  charge  ~  mC/cm/wire  per  year),  are  discussed  from  the  vast 
majority of aging data. 
  - There are a lot of experiments that clearly indicate premature aging in Ar/CH4 mixtures [2,4,5,9]. This 
observation indicates that CH4 itself polymerizes in the avalanche plasma due to the hydrogen deficiency of 
radicals  and  their  ability  to  make  bonds  with  hydrocarbon  molecules,  and  similarly  for  all  hydrocarbon 
gases. The aging rate in Ar/hydrocarbon gases can be reduced by addition of oxygen-containing molecules, 
allowing large systems to operate at low intensity without dramatic loss of performance [11-13]. However, 
Ar/hydrocarbon gases are not trustworthy for long-term, high rate experiments.

  - Silicon has been systematically detected in analysis of many wire deposits (see Fig.1), although in many 
cases the source of the Si-pollutant has not been clearly identified [2,4]. The Si-compounds are found in 
many lubricants, adhesives and rubber, encapsulation compounds, silicon-based grease, various oils, G-10, 
RTV, O-rings, fine dust, gas impurities, polluted gas cylinders, diffusion pumps, standard flow regulators, 
molecular sieves, and their presence may not necessarily be noted in the manufacturer’s documentation [9]. 
The most dangerous ones are Si-lubricant traces, which are widely used for the production of gas system 
components,  may  be  efficiently  clean  by  flushing  DME  through  the  gas  system.  If  the  amount  of  Si-
pollutant  is not  very  large,  the  equipment  (e.g.  flow-regulator parts)  can  be  cleaned  in  an ultrasonic bath 
with  isopropyl  alcohol  [15].  Due  to  the  high  specific  polymerization  rate  of  Si  in  gas  detectors,  a  strict 
validation process for all assembly components has to be foreseen [16]. 
  -  The  Malter  effect  [17]  is  due  to  the  microscopic  insulating  layer  deposited  on  a  cathode  from  the 
quencher  dissociation  products  and/or  pollutant  molecules.  Some  of  the  metal  oxide  coatings,  adsorbed 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

layers on the cathode or cathode material itself may not be initially conducting enough and may inhibit the 
neutralization  of  positive  ions  arriving  from  the  avalanche,  which  generate  a  strong  electric  field  across 
dielectric  film  and  cause  electron  field-emission  from  the  cathode  [8].  A  positive  feedback  between  the 
electron  emission  at  the  cathode  and  anode  amplification  will  lead  to  the  appearance  of  dark  current, 
increased  rate  of  noise  pulses  and  finally  may  result  in  the  exponential  current  growth  (classical  Malter 
breakdown) [18]. The addition of water was found to prevent Malter discharges in classical wire chambers, 
since water increases the conductivity of partially damaged electrodes; in one test Malter effect was cured 
by the addition of O2 to damaged chamber and running at large current [19]. 

2.  Aging phenomena in the high-rate LHC era 

 

   A  dramatic  increase  of  the  radiation  intensity  encountered  by  gaseous  detectors  (collected  charge  ~ 
C/cm/wire per year) at the high-rate experiments of the LHC era has demanded a concerted effort towards 
finding  appropriate  gas  mixtures,  adequate  assembly  materials  and  procedures  and  strict  quality  control 
checks as a part of fighting against aging. Very often, problems encountered with first prototype detectors 
for  the  LHC  environments  have  been  due  to  the  casual  selection  of  chamber  designs,  gas  mixtures, 
materials and gas system components, which successfully worked with certain gas gain at ‘low rates’ [4], 
but  rapidly  failed  in  harsh  radiation  environment  [5].  For  example,  many  non-metallic  ‘good  materials’ 
successfully  used  in  the  large  systems  of  the  LEP  era  might  nevertheless  outgass  at  a  small  level,  thus 
causing fast aging under high rates [3,9]. A large amount of outgassing data have been accumulated in the 
framework of project RD-10 (A study to improve the radiation hardness of gaseous detectors for use at very 
high  luminosity),  which  afterwards  was  merged  with  the  more  specific  research  RD-28  on  MSGC 
(Development  of  Micro-Strip  Gas  Chambers  for  radiation  detection  and  tracking  at  high  rates)  [20].  A 
specific material is either adequate or not for a particular detector type and operating conditions – one has 
to  do  tests  matching  the  specific  requirements  of  the  experiment.  In  the  following,  a  summary  of  recent 
research, focused on the understanding of detector behavior after exposure to the very high radiation levels 
anticipated in the LHC-like conditions, will be described. 

2.1.  Gases of possible interest for the high-rate hadronic environments 

    Future  high  energy  and  luminosity  colliders  pose  a  new  challenge  for  gas  mixtures,  raising  the 
requirement  to  their  radiation  hardness  up  to  ~10  C/cm/wire  for  wire-type  and  ~20  mC/mm2  for  micro-
pattern  detectors.  While  a  huge  variety  of  gases  have  been  successfully  used  for  the  `standard  radiation 
level’ detectors, only a limited choice of gases is available for the new high-rate experiments of the LHC 
era.  Among  the  conventional  gas  mixtures  only  Ar(Xe)/CO2  and  Ar(Xe)/CO2/O2  are  demonstrated  to 
tolerate such doses. Unfortunately, Ar(Xe)/CO2 are quite transparent for photons. The addition of 2-3% O2 
enlarges  the  operational  safety  margin  of  the  mixture  (ozone  is  a  strong  absorber  of  UV-photons),  while 
reducing the signal due to the electron attachment [16]. 
    About  20  years  ago,  CF4  was  proposed  as  the  most  attracting  candidate  for  high-rate  environments 
[21,22]. This is primarily due to the high-drift velocity, high primary ionization, low electron diffusion and 
resistance to aging [23-25]. However, CF4 molecule has a small quenching cross-section of metastable Ar-
states [26] and excited CF4 molecules copiously emit photons from the far UV (peak around ~170 nm – 7.3 
eV)  to  the  visible  light,  and  have  about  25%  of  Ar  scintillation  efficiency  in  the  UV  [27,28].  Being 
transparent to its own UV photons, CF4 presents serious gain limitation in wire chambers due to the photo-
electric emission from the cathode. On the contrary, GEMs operate well in Ar/CF4 because the avalanche 
confinement within the GEM holes strongly suppresses photon-mediated secondary processes. In addition, 
Ar(Xe)/CF4  mixtures  have  rather  poor  energy  and  spatial  resolution  due  to  the  electron  attachment 
processes  in  CF4,  which occurs  mainly  in  the 6  to 8  eV  range  [29,30]. The production  of  long-lived  and 
highly electronegative radicals, observed under strong irradiation in CF4-based mixtures, can significantly 
degrade performance of large detectors with insufficient gas flow or operated in a closed-loop gas system 
[31-35]. The advantages of the enhanced drift velocity of CF4 for high rate applications have been realized 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

by the addition of one of the common quenchers (e.g. CH4,CO2) to CF4 or to Ar/CF4. This can also ‘cool’ 
electrons to the extent that attachment does not occur [23]. 
   There  has  been  a  strong  interest  in  the  use  of  CF4  for  high-rate  applications  in  future  high  luminosity 
colliders  because  it  was  believed  that  most  of  CF4-based  mixtures  can  prevent  ‘classical  aging  effects’. 
Since  long  time  CF4  is  used  in  plasma  processing  as  an  excellent  etching  gas  for  Si  and  Si-containing 
materials, which react with fluorine to form volatile Si-F based compounds [36]. However, CF4 plasma is 
not a good etching gas for organic polymers that do not contain Si in the backbone chain and contain lots of 
H.  Actually,  the  addition  of  hydrogenated  species  shifts  the  chemistry  of  CF4  plasmas  towards 
polymerization  (Ar/CF4/CH4  and  C2H2F4  gases  would  form  polymers,  at  least  at  low  pressure)  [37,38], 
while  addition  of  oxygenated  species  shifts  the  chemistry  of  CF4  plasmas  towards  etching  [39].  While 
plasma characteristics (50 mtorr, rf, deposition rate ~50 nm/min) differ from those of gas detectors (atm, 
dc, ~50 nm/year), it is likely that some useful hints of plasma chemistry could be applicable to the field of 
gaseous detectors (energy range of electrons is similar) [1,2]. In wire chambers, within the broad spectrum 
of gases there is no mixture without CF4 that is able to tolerate doses ~ 20 C/cm/wire [15]. However, the 
presence of  a CF4  component  in  the gas  limits  the  choice  of  construction  materials  for detectors  and gas 
systems.  Decomposition  of  CF4  molecules  in  the  avalanche  process  contaminates  the  gas  with  fluorine 
radicals,  which  react  violently  with  exposed  electrode  surfaces  to  form  metal  fluorides  or  cause  etching 
phenomena. Non-gold anode wires are unacceptable for use in CF4-based mixtures due to the formation of 
metal  fluorides  [40].  However,  the  use  of  gold-plated  electrodes  does  not  necessarily  ensure  good  aging 
properties in CF4, and many results show contradictory experience with CF4-based operation, where both 
polymerization and material etching phenomena take place. 

2.2.  Aging in Ar/CF4/CH4, CF4/CH4 and C2H2F4 mixtures 

  Several laboratory tests in the beginning of the 90’s have demonstrated excellent aging properties, up to 
10  C/cm/wire,  of  CF4/iC4H10  (80:20)  avalanches,  which  also  had  an  ability  to  etch  silicon-based  and 
hydrocarbon deposits, from previously etched Au/W-wires [40-42]. Based on these studies, the dominant 
role  of  etching  processes  with  increasing  CF4  concentration  was  assumed  for  CF4/hydrocarbon  mixtures. 
However,  using  the  same  laboratory  setup  for  accelerated  tests  (current  density  ~  1.2µA/cm),  a  lack  of 
apparent  aging  has  been  observed  in  CF4/iC4H10  mixtures  for  CF4  concentrations  (30-85%  and  ~100%), 
while heavy carbonaceous deposits were observed for other CF4 concentrations on Au/W-wires [40]. The 
existence  of  an  aging  region  for  CF4  concentrations  between  ~85%  and  <100%  was  unexpected.  The 
authors proposed a model to explain two regions of polymerization and etching in CF4/iC4H10, based on the 
relative proportions of CF4 and iC4H10 in the mixture. However, a quick formation of anode deposits in the 
‘aging  resistant’  CF4/iC4H10  (80:20)  gas  was  observed  in  the  high  rate  environment  [43].  Several  other 
studies  under  harsh  radiation  environment  have  demonstrated  that  CF4/hydrocarbon  gases  represent  the 
most  extreme  case  of  etching  competiting  with  polymer  formation.  While  prototype  honeycomb  drift 
chambers have been proven to be immune to very high X-ray doses up to 5 C/cm/wire, severe anode and 
cathode aging effects were found in Ar/CF4/CH4 (74:20:6) and CF4/CH4 (80:20) mixtures in the high-rate 
HERA-B  environment  (secondaries  from  interactions  of  920  GeV  protons  with  target  nucleus)  [34].  An 
extensive  R&D  program,  carried  out  at  10  different  radiation  facilities  to  resemble  HERA-B  conditions, 
traced aging problems to a combination of several effects; a solution which uses gold-coated cathode foils 
and  Ar/CF4/CO2  mixture  was  found  to  survive  in  the  high-rate  hadronic  environment.  The  aging 
performance of HERA-B muon proportional chambers with Ar/CF4/CH4 and CF4/CH4 mixtures has shown 
that the aging rate depends on the type of irradiation, high voltage and area of irradiation. Fig.2 shows SEM 
micrographs of typical wire deposits after irradiation in Ar/CF4/CH4 (67:30:3) [35]. A dramatic degradation 
of  the  kapton  XC  foils  used  as  a  straw  material  in  the  LHC-b  tracker  was  observed  under  the  glow 
discharge  in  Ar/CF4/CH4  [44].  These results  indicate  that CF4/hydrocarbon  mixtures  might be  inclined  to 
growth  of  polymers  at  high  ionization  densities,  due  to  simultaneous  polymerization  of  CFx  and  CHx 
radicals. Apparently, C2H2F4-containing gases used in RPCs are also prone to polymerization; furthermore 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

the addition of water to this gas will greatly enhance the formation of HF, which is a good etching agent of 
glass  in  laboratory.  In  a  view  of  very  small  safety  margins,  long-term  operation  of  large  systems  with 
CF4/hydrocarbon-based gases in the high radiation density environment of future experiments seems to be 
of considerable risk.

2.3.  Aging in Ar/CF4 and Ar/CF4/CO2 mixtures   

   Both  Ar/CF4  and  Ar(Xe)/CF4/CO2  seem  to  be  perfect  for  non-polymerizing  gases;  under  optimal 
operating  conditions,  no  observable  drop  in  gain  due  to  polymerization  of  gas  mixture  components  has 
been found in many tests (see Table 1). Moreover, a small addition of CF4 to Ar/CO2 in the high luminosity 
LHC  environment  is  very  efficient  to  clean  up  Si-aged  wires  [16].  The  resulting  balance  between  Si-
polymerization  and  CF4  etching  processes  was  found  to  be  very  sensitive  to  the  Si-source  intensity  and 
ionization  density  [15].  Recent  investigations  in  Ar(Xe)/CF4/CO2  mixtures  revealed  ‘new  aging 
phenomena’ – the etching of the gold-plating of anode wires in straws and rupture of wires in honeycomb 
drift  tubes  [15,34,45].  Dedicated  studies  for  the  ATLAS  TRT  straws  demonstrated  that  the  main 
components responsible for the gold wire damage, and formation of WO deposits, are chemically reactive 
products  of  CF4  disintegration,  in  connection  with  water  (HF  acid)  [15].  The  magnitude  of  the  damage 
processes was found to depend on the wire manufacturing technology and gold plating thickness. No gold 
damage effects have been observed, for Toshiba 30 µm Au/W-wire and H2O < 0.1%, up to 20 C/cm (see 
Fig.2).  Moreover,  destruction  processes  of  wire  gold-plating  were  usually  observed  at  collected  charges 
larger than 0.5 C/cm/wire accumulated at extreme current densities (~1-5 µA/cm), compared to the LHC 
environment  (<100nA/cm).  Initial  imperfections  in  the  gold  crystalline  structure  might  stimulate  local 
micro-discharges and sparking under very high dose rates, which can greatly enhance the magnitude of CF4 
plasma etching processes compared to the typical avalanche conditions and moderate charge accumulation 
rates, and play a dominant role in further destruction of gold-plating. No significant gold damage effects 
have been observed for several wire types at current densities <0.5 µA/cm (see Table 1). 
    While no anode deposits, due to the polymerization of gas mixture components, have been observed on 
Au/W-wires  after  exposure  in  Ar/CF4/CO2,  a  bulk  of  data  indicate  the  changes  of  consistency  and 
appearance  of  fluorine-containing  (often  accompanied  by  Si)  films  on  non-gold  plated  cathodes 
[14,35,40,46,47].  Since  the  resultant  insulating  layers  may  lead  to  increased  dark  current,  spurious  noise 
counts and finally trigger the self-sustained Malter discharge, the use of the more robust electrode materials 
to  CF4  is  recommended  (e.g.  gold-plated  electrodes  or  cathode  straw  materials)  [15,52].  Another  very 
dangerous drawback of the CF4 avalanches is creation of harmful fluorine radicals and HF acid, which were 
found to attack and strongly etch surfaces exposed to gas, such as Al and Cu coatings in straw, diamond 
coated MSGC, GEM foils, and heavily destroy all glass materials (rotameters, FR4, etc.) [16,41,48-51]. For 
instance,  the  glass  wire  joints  (containing  Si)  inside  long  straws  were  etched  to  the  point  of  breakage  in 
Xe/CF4/CO2; a new Xe/CO2/O2 mixture has been selected to ensure reliable operation in the ATLAS TRT.

Nevertheless, short periodic ‘cleaning runs’ with Ar/CF4/CO2 (70:3:27) in a flushing mode are foreseen, if 
needed,  to  clean  up  Si-aged  straw  wires  [16].  In  general,  it  seems  that  the  CF4  etching  rate  is  roughly 
proportional to the CF4 concentration and to the current density.

   Finally, the use of very expensive Xe/CF4-based gases forces large detectors to use recirculation systems 
where  special  purification  elements  to  remove  long-lived  fluorine  radicals  have  to  be  foreseen.  For  the 
‘cheaper’ Ar/CF4 gases, accumulation of fluorine molecules in the closed-loop system can be avoided by 
replacing part of the mixture coming out from detector by fresh gas, or operation in a flushing mode, at the 
expense of extra costs, can be considered. The very high aggressiveness of CF4 dissociative products and 
the  dynamic  modification  of  the  gas  composition  require  more  studies  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  these 
effects on the long-term performance and stability of large-area gaseous detectors. However, CF4 is very 
effective  in  blocking  the  extremely  negative  influence  of  Si-pollutants;  the  apparent  immunity  of  CF4-
containing  mixtures  to  the  classical  aging  effects  might  play  a  unique  role  for  the  improved  radiation 
hardness of gas detectors in severe radiation LHC environment.  

2.4.  Aging in Ar(Xe)/CO2 and Ar(Xe)/CO2/O2 mixtures 

  Both Ar(Xe)/CO2 and Ar(Xe)/CO2/O2 could be absolutely radiation resistant under clean conditions in all 
types of gaseous detectors; there is no well-established mechanism which could lead to formation of anode 
deposits  in  these  mixtures  [1,2,54-56,107].  However,  the  aging  performance  in  Ar(Xe)/CO2  and 
Ar(Xe)/CO2/O2 is sensitive to hydrocarbon contamination and even to minor traces of silicon pollutants in 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

the  detector  (e.g.  straw  material  may  contain  a  few  atomic  Si  mono-layers)  and  in  the  gas-system 
components  (Si-based  lubricant  residues)  [14-16,57].  In  case  of  a  weak  external  silicon  source  in  the 
gaseous  detector,  several  studies  revealed  appearance  of  aging  effects  at  the  beginning  (in  terms  of  gas 
flow)  of  the  irradiated  area  (all  Si-molecules  are  quickly  eaten  up  by  the  avalanche  process  and  produce 
deposits)  and  sometimes  even  right  before  the  irradiated  area  (due  to  the  upstream  diffusion  of  active 
species  at  low  gas  flows).  In  case  of  much  larger pollution by  Si-lubricants,  deposits  have  a  tendency  to 
propagate along the whole detector.  
   In  recent  tests,  silicon  deposits  were  also  observed  in  Xe/CO2/O2  in  the  gas  system,  which  was 
successfully operated during several years with the CF4-containing mixture without any aging effects [16]. 
This  would  indicate  that  even  specially  certified  and  cleaned  gas  systems  for  CF4  operation  might  have 
small  traces  of  silicon  contamination.  Therefore,  extraordinary  validation  procedures  will  be  required  to 
reach the necessary level of purity for all components used in the detectors and closed-loop recirculation 
gas systems in Ar(Xe)/CO2; the final prove that CF4-free gases can be used for large-scale, high-rate, long-
term applications still has to come. 

3.  Aging in Micro-pattern Gas Detectors (MPGD) 

   Future  high-luminosity  experiments  have  prompted  a  series  of  inventions  of  novel  high-rate  gaseous 
detectors: MSGC, GEM, MICROMEGAS and many others [58]. The MSGC, a novel concept invented in 
1988 by Oed [59], was the first of the microstructure gas detectors. Consisting of a set of tiny metal strips 
laid on a thin insulating substrate, and alternatively connected as anodes and cathodes, the MSGC relies for 
its  operation  on  the  same  processes  of  avalanche  multiplication  as  multi-wire  devices  [60].  Despite  the 
promising performance (spatial resolution ~40µm, high rate capability <106 Hz mm-2), MSGC has entered a 
new dimension of sensitivity to aging, compared to MWPC, due to the filigree nature of MSGC structures 
and catalytic effects on the MSGC substrate. There are several major processes, particularly at high rates, 
leading  to  MSGC  operating  instabilities:  charge-up  of  substrates,  surface  deposition  of  polymers,  and 
destructive  microdischarges [3,60,61].  The  influence of  glass  conductivity  has  been verified for  MSGCs: 
the  use  of  ionic  conductive  glass  DESAG  D-263  as  a  substrate  results  in  rate-dependent  modification  of 
gain due to the radiation induced variation of surface resistivity. This effect can be explained as electrical 
field  distortions  caused  by  accumulation  of  charges  on  the  insulating  surface  between  strips  and/or  slow 
migration  of  ions  (the  majority  charge  carriers)  inside  the  glass  bulk.  Using  MSGCs  manufactured  on 
electron-conducting SCHOTT S-8900 or diamond-coated D-263 glass, excellent high-rate performance and 
long-term  stability  have  been  demonstrated.  Early  aging  studies  of  MSGCs  indicated  that  they  are  much 
more  susceptible  to  aging  than  wire  chambers,  possibly  due  to  a  small  effective  area  used  for  charge 
multiplication and thus higher energy density in the avalanche plasma [3]. Micro-strip chambers have been 
successfully operated with a large variety of gases; to prevent fast aging at high rates, convincing evidence 
suggests  to  avoid  organic  quenchers  in  the  gas.  Under  optimal  laboratory  conditions,  a  lifetime  of  the 
MSGC  equivalent  to  more  than  10  years  of  operation  in  the  LHC  has  been  achieved  (see  Table  2). 
However,  although  MSGC’s  survive  very  strong  particle  fluxes  of  X-rays  or  electrons,  they  can  be 
destroyed  within  a  few  hours  in  beams  of  pions  or  protons  due  to  multiple  anode-cathode  discharges 
(sparks). The problem of microdischarges, induced by heavily ionizing particles and destroying the fragile 
MSGC electrode structure, turned out to be a major limitation to all single-stage micro-pattern detectors in 
hadronic beams [51,62]. 
    Sharing the amplification process between two cascaded devices, a GEM followed by MSGC, permits, 
for  a given gain,  to  operate  both  elements  below  the  onset  of  induced discharges  in  a high  rate hadronic 
environment.  Introduced  by  Sauli  in  1996,  a  GEM  consists  of  a  set  of  holes,  typically  50-70  µm  in 
diameter, chemically etched through a 50 µm thick copper-kapton-copper polymer foil [63]. Application of 
a suitable voltage difference between the metal layers of the GEM produces a strong electric field in the 
holes (~50-100 kV/cm), where the gas amplification happens. No aging effects and no damage of electrode 
strips were observed for MSGC-GEM in Ar/DME in high-rate X-ray tests, irradiating ‘small’ surface areas. 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

However,  the  use  of  Ar/DME,  originally  foreseen  as  a  counting  gas  in  most  MSGC  and  MSGC+GEM 
developments,  lead  to  visible  deposits  on  electrodes  under  X-rays,  if  the  size  of  irradiated  area  is  large 
enough (~104 mm), while identical chambers with Ar/CO2 showed no aging [51]. The large MSGC+GEM 
detectors have been successfully used in the DIRAC [64] and in the HERA-B experiments [51].

   Another very attractive and promising solution to reduce the probability of hazardous discharges and to 
minimize aging effects in MPGD is to separate gas amplification (GEM) and readout stage – printed circuit 
board (PCB) electrodes, which operate at unity gain and serve only as an electron collector. Many studies 
of GEM radiation hardness were carried out using X-ray beams, generating about 10-20 larger avalanches 
than  MIP.  No  significant  aging  effects  in  Ar/CO2  were  observed  in  a  triple  GEM  study  in  Purdue  after 
irradiating a few mm2 of GEM up to 27 mC/mm2 [68]. A sign of moderate aging in the double GEM, after 
25  mC/mm2,  was  found  in  the  form  of  discoloration  around  the  rims  of  the  holes  on  the  lower  GEM 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

electrode,  adjacent  to  the  charge  collection  PCB,  and  may  be  due  to  accumulation  of  hydrocarbon 
impurities  in  the  gas  [67].  Negligible  gain  variations  were  also  found  in  small  area  aging  tests  for  three 
different CF4-based mixtures after 100 mC/mm2 [72]. However, an evident current drop was observed in 
the heavily irradiated large scale (20*24cm2) triple GEM in an Ar/CF4/CO2 (45:40:15) after 20 mC/mm2 
(see Table 2). The decrease of the electric field intensity inside the holes, resulting in a smaller gain, was 
traced both to the CF4 etching of copper and kapton in proximity of GEM hole edges and appearance of 
CuF  metal  fluorides  in  these  places,  and  can  be  avoided  by  the  sufficient  increase  in  gas  flow  [73].  In 
general, radiation damage to the GEM structure was found to be the most significant around the rims of the 
holes  (where  the  electric  fields  exceeds  the  average)  and  for  the  last  GEM  in  series  (where  number  and 
density of avalanche electrons is the largest). No visible damage of PCB surfaces was found in both double 
and  triple  GEMs,  which  suggests  that  the  absence  of  a  high  field  amplification  region  eliminates  the 
possibility of forming deposits on the charge-collecting anodes. The superior radiation hardness of multi-
GEM devices was demonstrated in large-area aging tests at CERN. Neither loss of gain nor evidence for 
the formation of deposits was observed in non-polymerizing Ar/CO2 (70:30) mixture up to ~10 mC/mm2 
[69,70]; this accumulated charge is sufficient for large-scale and long-term experiments in intense radiation 
fields. Furthermore, in these studies the GEM detector was found to be less sensitive to aging, caused by 
impurities and trace contaminants in Ar/CO2, than a single wire proportional counter installed in the same 
gas line, behind the GEM detector [69]. However, the conditions at high energy physics colliders near the 
interaction region can not be approximated by a photon beam. The high electric field at the edges of GEM 
holes,  where  the  copper  and  Kapton  meet,  tends  to  induce  micro-discharges  under  harsh  radiation 
environments, which could slowly damage the copper and kapton. The modification of the GEM electrode 
geometry, which could be also enhanced under CF4 avalanches, may influence polarization effects in the 
insulator,  resulting  in  dependence  of  charging  effects  from  the  accumulated  charge,  in  reduction  of  rate 
capability  and  may  also  limit  the  plateau  length  due  to  the  onset  of  discharges  at  smaller  voltages. 
However, since multi-GEM detectors allows sharing the gain between several electrodes, they have much 
higher  reliability  and  can  give  only  one  discharge  per  1012  incident  protons,  which  is  4-5  orders  of 
magnitude smaller than for Micromegas. 
    Introduced  in  1996  by  Giomataris  [79],  a  micro-mesh  gaseous  structure  (Micromegas)  is  a  two  stage 
parallel plate electrode gas detector, composed of a ~3 mm drift gap (electric field ~ 1 kV/cm) and a 100 
µm high amplification region (~50 kV/cm), located between a thin cathode metal grid (micromesh), and the 
anode  readout  plane  (strips/pads  of  a  conductor,  printed  on  a  insulator  board).  With  a  single  stage 
amplification  detector  like  Micromegas  one  can  not  eliminate  completely  discharges  in  the  presence  of 
heavily ionizing particles; with the non-polymerizing Ar/CO2 mixture the observed sparking rate was found 
to be unacceptable. However, Micromegas, used as a standalone device, were demonstrated not to suffer 
permanent  damages  even  after  accumulating  107/mm2  sparks  triggered  by  highly  ionizing  particles  [74]. 
The high radiation hardness of Micromegas has been demonstrated using an intense X-ray generator even 
with hydrocarbon mixtures (see Table 2). It may be related to the fact that avalanche electrons are collected 
by  the  grounded  anode  strips,  which  are  analogous  to  the  PCB  in  GEM  devices.  Nevertheless,  since  the 
aging is known to occur in a parallel plate geometry [80] and may be increased under sparking due to the 
heavily  ionizing  background,  long-term  aging  tests  of  proper  functioning  of  Micromegas  under  the 
expected  LHC-like  environment  have  to  be  foreseen.  More  work  is  also  needed  to  study  corrosive 
properties of CF4 on the long-term performance of Micromegas and GEMs in the intense hadron beams. A 
possible way to enhance their aging performance and to reduce the sparking rate of Micromegas is to add 
another  preamplification  device  like  a  GEM.  One  test  has  shown  that  a  Micromegas+GEM  combination 
exhibits no deterioration in performance in Ar/CO2 up to 23 mC/mm2 [77]. 
   Both Micromegas and GEM devices seems to be adequate for high-rate, long-term experiments opening 
an  important  new  field  of  applications  of  gas  filled  detectors.  The  best  confirmation  of  the  radiation 
hardness of  the  GEM  technology  for high-rate  applications  comes  from  the  successful operation of  large 
area  triple-GEMs  with  Ar/CO2  in  the  COMPASS  experiment  (accumulated  charge  ~  2.3  mC/mm2  since 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

2002) [78], where the detected particles are mainly muons at a rate 2*107 Hz with a relatively small amount 
of hadrons 5*104 Hz. Large area Micromegas are also routinely used for particle tracking in the COMPASS 
beam  [81]  and  in  the  3*105  Hz/mm2  kaon  beam  in  the  NA48/KABES  experiment  in  Ne/C2H6/CF4 
(79:11:10). 

4.  Aging in Gaseous Photodetectors 

    In recent years, there has been considerable work in the field of photon imaging detectors by combining 
solid  CsI-photocathodes  (PC)  with  MWPCs  or  GEMs  to  detect  single  photo-electrons.  There  are  several 
mechanisms under the usual RICH irradiation conditions, which may change the electronic structure of CsI 
and  cause  a  decay  of  quantum  efficiency:  exposure  to  air  (H20),  photon  impact,  ion  bombardment  and 
creation  of  polymerizing  contaminants  in  the  avalanche  process  [82-85].  Non-aging  gas  mixtures  are  of 
primary  importance  for  the  development  of  gas-photomultipliers,  where  even  tiny  amount  of  chemically 
active  molecules  and  ions  created  in  an  avalanche  can  destroy  the  photosensitive  layer  [86].  The  use  of 
GEM gaseous photomultipliers in pure CF4 with reflective photocathodes, evaporated directly on the upper 
GEM electrode, opens new applications of windowless Cherenkov detectors, where both the radiator and 
the photosensor operate in the same gas [87]. As compared to CsI-multiwire detectors, the shielding power 
of the multi-GEM amplification structure considerably reduces photon (CsI is sensitive to CF4 scintillation 
at  170  nm)  and  ion  feedback  at  the  photocathode,  and  therefore  CsI  aging  in  the  gas  avalanches.  The 
compatibility of CF4 with CsI-PC was demonstrated in one short aging test [88] (see Table 2); long-term 
aging studies with full size CsI-GEM detectors in CF4, to ensure an efficient and reliable operation under 
LHC-like conditions, have to be foreseen. 

5.  Aging in Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) 

    In  the  1990’s,  RPC  were  proposed  as  an  economical  and  proven  technology  ideally  suited  for  precise 
time  measurements  (1  ns)  on  a  large-area  detector.  Both  the  Belle  and  BaBar  experiments  have 
instrumented  their flux returns with  RPCs operated  in streamer  mode  (see  Table 3). One of  the potential 
reason of RPC degradation is related to the fluorine compound - C2H2F4, which is the main component of 
present RPC gas mixtures and can produce HF, especially with water vapour, under the electrical discharge 
[89]. Aging effects, presumably due to simultaneous etching of the glass by fluorine ions and deposition of 
avalanche  products  on  the  electrode  surfaces,  were  first  detected  in  Belle  RPCs  [50].  In  dedicated 
laboratory  tests,  it  was  confirmed  that  after  short  operation  of  glass  RPCs  with  ~  1000  ppm  of  H2O  in 
C2H2F4-containing gas, partial/full recovery of efficiency is observed, while when glass RPCs operate in a 
wet  gas  for  a  long  time  the  degradation  becomes  permanent.  After  the  wet  gas  operation  in  C2H2F4  both 
anode and cathode got damaged; the anode surface had a high level of fluoride, while the cathode lacked 
sodium. The authors explained the symptoms of aged chambers by spontaneous field emission of electrons 
from  local  deposits/tips  on  the  cathode surface  [90,91]. In  one  test,  the area with  reduced  efficiency was 
clearly located along the preferential path of the gas flow [92]. It has to be noted, that ammonia flushing 
allows full recovery of the damaged glass chamber [91]. However, the glass RPC can suffer from the long-
term instability due to the migration of alkali ions, which will lead to the permanent increase of the surface 
resistance. This phenomena prevented successful operation of ionic conductive D-263 glass and forced to 
choose electron conductive ordiamond coated glass for the MSGC substrate [3,8]. 
   The initial problems observed in BaBar RPCs, made of Bakelite coated with linseed oil were related to 
the  lack  of  polymerization  of  the  linseed  oil,  electrochemical  change  of  the  linseed  oil  resistivity  and 
formation of oil droplets under the influence of high temperature and high currents; more information can 
be found in [8,93,95]. Recent systematic R&D studies have shown that the bakelite volume and linseed oil 
surface  resistance,  which  are  the  main  parameters  affecting  the  long-term  performance  of  RPC,  can  be 
altered by the operation at increased temperature, total integrated current per unit surface, presence of water 
and complicated fluorocarbon chemistry. A steady increase of the total electrode resistance and therefore 
reduction of rate capability, as a result of the current flowing through the electrodes and especially due to 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

the decrease of the water content in the bakelite under dry gas, was identified as the main aging effect in the 
oiled  bakelite  RPC  [94].  Several  studies  indicated  that  the  increase  of  surface  resistivity  can  be  greatly 
reduced  by  flushing  the  essential  flow  of  humid  gas  through  the  chamber  [94].  The  ionic  conduction 
mechanism  of  bakelite-based  RPC,  modulated  by  the  presence  of  water  was  proposed  by  J.  Va’vra  [8]; 
further tests of the electrical conduction mechanism in the RPC might shed more light on the underlying 
physics  processes  and  guarantee  their  reliable  use  under  harsh  experimental  conditions.  One  of  the  main 
concern for the long-term RPC operation comes from the fact that the distribution of surface resistivity in 
large detector system is unpredictable as it depends on local variations of surface resistivity – which itself 
depends  on  consistency  of  the  electrode  surfaces  as  a  function  of  the  accumulated  charge  and  level  of 
humidity vs. gas flow. Another aging effect in RPC is related to the dramatical reduction of the linseed oil 
surface  resistance  due  to  the  deposition  of  fluorine  radicals  formed  from  the  C2H2F4-based  chemistry 
[8,89]; this effect may be significantly enhanced under the sparking even for avalanche mode operation. In 
addition, the smaller radiation damage in RPCs is expected for the reduced content of electronegative gas 
SF6  in  the  mixture  [94].  Another  hypothesis  to  be  investigated  is  that  during  operation  with  C2H2F4  gas 
electrodes may accumulate photosensitive deposits; in this case UV light from avalanches will lead to the 
electron emission from the cathode, causing low detection efficiency and degrading chamber performance. 
Finally, future LHC experiments will operate RPCs in the avalanche mode, which is desirable in terms of 
total  accumulated  charge.  However,  much  higher  particle  fluxes  and  appearance  of  discharges  requires 
more  study  to  find  ‘safe’  operational  parameters  of  the  large  RPC  systems  in  the  LHC  environment.  It 
should  be  stressed  though,  that  the  problems  with  RPCs  are  not  ‘classical  aging  effects’,  but  rather 
unpredictable  surface  effects,  related  to  the  specific  choice  of  construction  materials  and  operating 
conditions.

6.  The Fundamental Limitations and Long-Term Performance of Gaseous Detectors at 

High Ionization Densities 

  The new generation of high-rate detectors of the LHC era has not only to cope with high dose rates, but 
also has to survive in the presence of highly ionizing particles, neutrons, low energy gammas and spallation 
products, with an average energy deposition 10-1000 times larger for MIP’s.  One of the most challenging 
applications of gaseous detectors, the efficient detection of minimum ionizing particles in a high intensity 
hadronic  environment,  might  be  limited  in  gain  and  rate  by  discharges.  In  wire-type  detectors,  the  high 
counting rate lowers the gain due to the onset of space charge effects and this actually prevents sparking at 
high rates. Contrary to classical multi-wire chambers, in high-rate micropattern detectors the gain remains 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

unchanged with rate. However, the maximum achievable gain before sparking drops with the counting rate 
and in the presence of heavily ionizing particles, an additional gain drop of 1-2 orders of magnitude may 
appear [96-98]. Owing to very small distance between anode and cathode for the fast removal of ions in the 
micro-pattern  detectors  the  transition  from  proportional  mode  to  streamer  can  be  easily  followed  by  the 
discharge, if the avalanche size (the product of ionization and gain) exceeds 107-108 ion-electron pairs, the 
so-called Raether limit. Therefore, one should lower the gain at high rates for reliable operation. However, 
the ballistic deficit, i.e. the loss of the signal due to fast amplifiers and too short integration time in the LHC 
experiments  at  25  ns  beam  crossings,  does  not  allow  to  reach  full  efficiency  to  MIPs  at  sufficiently  low 
gain.  This  situation  may  be  aggravated  in  the  CF4-based  mixtures,  where  due  to  the  significant  electron 
attachment and thus broader dynamic range of signals, a higher fraction of small amplitudes at the same gas 
gain is expected.  
   Therefore, if the detector operating point is set for efficient detection of relativistic particles, it is likely 
that a highly ionizing particle, releasing an exceptionally high amount of electron-ion pairs in the active gas 
volume,  will  produce  a  streamer,  which  may  be  followed  by  the  onset  of  multiple  streamers,  sparks  and 
discharges.  Once  the  streamer  establishes  a  conductive  channel  between  anode  and  cathode  the  power 
dissipated  in  the  spark  is  largely  dependent  on  the  effective  discharge  capacitance  and  the  gas  mixture. 
More  robust  detectors  (GEM,  Micromegas)  are  better  suited  for  the  harsh  environments  than  MSGC 
systems. By an appropriate choice of the electrode configuration and the gas, these detectors can tolerate 
certain  sparking  rate,  but  avoid  fundamental  problems  –  big  discharges  causing  permanent  damages  and 
subsequent detector failure. 
   After  the  many  years  of  intensive  research  and  development  of  radiation-hard  gaseous  detectors,  an 
impressive variety of experimental data has been accumulated from laboratory tests and detectors installed 
at high energy physics facilities. However, there are many contradictory experiences obtained in seemingly 
identical conditions, which means we are still lacking even a macroscopic explanation of the behavior of 
irradiated gaseous detectors. It is now well established that – even if a low aging rate can be obtained in the 
laboratory  with  radioactive  sources  and  otherwise  very  clean  conditions  –  large-area  detectors  using  the 
same mixture can fail due to severe aging after a relatively small beam exposure. Laboratory aging studies 
with radioactive sources suffer from one main limitation: they are obtained by irradiating a small part of the 
active  surface  of  the  chamber,  and  may  be  optimistic  both  in  rate  and  ionization  losses  as  compared  to 
realistic beam operating conditions. Moreover, with a suitable selection of irradiated area of the detector, a 
wide range of performances can be obtained; this clearly demonstrates a danger to characterize the long-
term  performance  of  a  large-scale  detector  by  exposure  to  radiation  of  small  areas  only.  Recent 
experimental  results  from  hadron  beam  shows  strong  dependence  of  the  detector  lifetime  upon  basic 
macroscopic variables: ionization density, irradiation rate, particle type and energy, high voltage (gas gain), 
size  of  the  irradiated  area  and  gas  flow  [5].  These  data  emphasize  the  importance  to  study  the  radiation 
hardness  of  the  ‘large-scale’  prototype  detector  under  conditions  as  close  as  possible  to  the  real 
environment. 

6.1. Aging vs. ionization density, irradiation rate and particle type 

   The experimental dependence of detector lifetime on ionization density, and in particular on irradiation 
rate, particle type and energy, can be related to the charge density and total dissipated energy in the detector 
from  the  incoming  particles.  It  is well  known  that for  many  gaseous  detectors (single  wire,  MWPC),  the 
counting  rate  capabilities  are  limited  by  space-charge  effects  in  the  avalanches,  which  can  either  lead  to 
gain reduction or, for higher applied voltages (when the total charge exceeds Raether limit) to the formation 
self-quenching streamers. Smaller gain losses for larger current densities, observed in laboratory tests with 
radioactive sources or X-rays [1-4], were attributed to the onset of space charge effects, which reduce the 
electron energy in the avalanche, thus decreasing the density of ions and radicals in the avalanche plasma 
(see  Fig.3).  However,  the  transition  between  proportional  and  streamer  mode  in  all  types  of  gaseous 
detectors, as well as the streamer pulse charge itself, depends not only on the high voltage but also on the 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

primary  ionization  density  [100,101].  Due  to  the  high  density  of  primary  electron-ion  pairs  produced  by 
α’s,  the  Raether  threshold  for  the  formation  of  streamers  along  the  α-track  may  be  reached  even  with 
moderate  multiplication  factors;  the  streamer  produces  a  densely  ionized  and  therefore  low  resistivity 
plasma medium between anode and cathode, which in some cases may lead to spark events. Each spark is a 
potential danger from the aging point of view because it can ‘prime’ the electrode surface for subsequent 
buildup of deposits. Any tips left from sparks on electrodes create local enhancement of electric field at the 
edges  of  imperfections.  The  self-sustained  Malter  current  and  sporadic  electron  jets  from  microscopic 
dielectric insertions on the cathodes [102,103] may be as significant as heavily ionizing particles, since the 
ions of the second generation proceed directly back to the same cathode spot along the same electric field 
lines  that  the  secondary  electrons  followed,  thus  creating  feedback  loops  and  facilitating  the  discharge 
propagation  along  these  low  resistivity  channels.  The number  of  molecules  and  the  extent  to  which  they 
‘crack’  along  these  densely  ionized  conductive  plasma  chains  can  be  greatly  increased  compared  to 
ordinary  wire  avalanches,  thus  significantly  reducing  detector  lifetime.  Additionally,  at  large  current 
densities (>100 nA/cm) and in presence of highly ionizing background, the streamers start overlapping in 
space and time effectively adding their respective charges; this effect is proportional to the irradiated area 
and  may  contribute  to  a  greatly  enhanced  polymerization  rate  in  large  systems  (see  Fig.3).  According  to 
this interpretation there could be some limiting current density which each detector can accept before the 
appearance of electrical breakdown [97]. 
 

Fig.3.  A  phenomenological  model  of  the  aging  rate  dependence  from  the  current  density  in  the  laboratory  tests  (with  radioactive 
sources or X-rays) and under harsh radiation LHC-like environment [104].

over half of its cell width with α’s  in Ar/CF4/CH4(74:20:6) [35].  
    With energy losses per α-track that can be ~103 times larger than for primary ionization with low density 
(X-rays or MIP), aging shows up as hair-like deposits randomly distributed within the irradiated area (see 
Fig. 4). The aging rate in Ar/CF4/CH4 (74:20:6) was found to be two orders of magnitude higher in a 100 

 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

MeV α-beam than in a small-scale laboratory test with a Fe55 source; both experiments were performed at 
similar current densities ~ 700 nA/cm [35]. Of special interest were the wires irradiated over half of their 
cell width; the ‘whisker’-type deposits were built only on one side (along the α-particle ionization tracks) 
towards  which  all  primary  electrons  drifted  (see  Fig.4).  These  results  clearly  indicate  that  the  aging 
properties  can  not  be  predicted  solely  on  the  basis  of  atomic  composition  ratios  in  the  mixture,  without 
taking  into  account  the  actual  operating  conditions.  Since  discharges,  sparks  and  electrical  breakdowns 
could  partly  simulate  environments  with  large  radiation  doses,  it  makes  sense  to  perform  special  tests 
irradiating  large  area  prototype  chambers  under  high  intensity  of  heavily  ionizing  particles  to  eliminate 
gases and construction materials which may promote the growth of polymers and thus examine the ‘safe 
parameters’  at  which  detector  can  be  operated.  However,  these  conditions  are  more  severe  than 
environment expected at LHC, where pions are dominating at small radii, being accompanied by heavily 
ionizing particles. It has to be noted that the determination of the accumulated charge, by integrating the 
continuously recorded anode current divided by the entire irradiated surface (‘current method’), can be only 
used if the spark and discharge rate are negligible; otherwise the current is dominated by huge charge doses 
at local ‘spark points’ on electrodes (e.g. tips, polymer deposits, dust particles, fingerprints). The ‘current 
method’ may also severely underestimate the collected charge at local chamber points after the appearance 
of the positive feedback and self-sustained Malter discharge at such distinct spots. It has to be emphasized, 
that  no  conclusions  about  the  detector  longevity  in  high  intensity  hadron  beams  can  be  drawn  from  the 
small-scale laboratory tests performed with radioactive sources or X-rays at huge accumulation doses >1 
µA/cm  (>100 nA/mm2  for  MPGD);  the  final  prove of  the  radiation hardness of gas  detector  can be  only 
acquired with exposures in realistic conditions (both in particle composition and ionization density). 

6.2. Aging vs. high voltage/gas gain/electric field strength 

    The experimental dependence of aging properties on the high voltage may be related to the dependence 
from  the  electric  field  strength  on  the  anode  surface,  which  enhances  inelastic  processes  (excitation, 
ionization)  and  determines  the  electron  temperature  in  the  avalanches.  A  lower  amplification  field  also 
strongly  reduces  the  UV  light  emission  in  the  avalanches  and  thus  the  strength  of  the  various  secondary 
phenomena on the nearby electrodes [99,105]. Fig.5 shows an example of nearly exponential decrease of 
detector lifetime with increase of anode voltage [56]. The aging rate may be also accelerated by avalanche 
formation at the cathode surface, if the electric field there exceeds ~10-20 kV/cm. Moreover, the lower the 
electric field at the cathode surface the more accumulated charge is required to deposit an insulating film at 
the cathode, since most of polymerizable species are produced in the high field region close to the anode 
and delivered to the cathode by electrostatic forces (due to positive charge or dipole moment) [1]. 
     

                     
Figure 5. Dependence of lifetime of ATLAS muon drift tubes irradiated in Ar/CH4/N2/CO2 (94:3:2:1) as a function of high voltage for 
different particle fluxes [56]. 

 

   In  recently  developed  GEM  devices,  a  reduction  in  the  electric  field  strength  (voltage  drop  and  thus  a 
lower  amplification  factor  across  a  single  GEM)  was  found  to  be  a  major  factor  which  increases  the 
reliability and radiation hardness of a triple-GEM detector, compared to double GEM, without sacrificing 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

the  total  gain  of  the  system  [68,70].  Superior  aging  properties  of  GEMs,  which  are  rather  insensitive  to 
aging compared to wire-type detectors, may be explained by the separation of multiplication and readout 
stages (the gas amplification is localized inside GEM holes) and by the smaller rate of polymerization of 
impurities  in  the  much  lower  electric  field  in  this  region  (50-100  kV/cm),  compared  to  the  anode  wire 
surface field ~250 kV/cm [70]. The lower electric field strength and larger avalanche charge spread over 
the whole multiplication region in the parallel plate mode (50 kV/cm), instead of just around a thin anode 
wire, may also lead to the high radiation hardness of Micromegas. 
    Finally, the appearance of discharges depends strongly on the detailed electrical field configuration in the 
detector, on any imperfections in the production process and on the composition of the radiation field (e.g. 
particle type, flux and energy).  In addition, the gain-voltage characteristics is steeper in poorly quenched 
gases  (e.g.  Ar/CO2),  revealing  the  essential  role  of  manufacturing  quality  required  for  a  uniform 
performance of large size detectors [98]. However, what is even more important is the topological layout 
under  irradiation.  If  the  conductivity  of  gas,  due  to  the  radiation-induced  breakdown  of  gas  rigidity  and 
onset  of  large  currents,  becomes  higher  than  the  one  of  the  insulator  at  the  ‘triple  junctions’  (singular 
points,  where  metal  electrode  structures  touch  the  insulator  in  the  counting  gas)  the  enormous  field 
enhancement close to dielectric surface is capable of inducing electrical breakdown during the avalanche 
multiplication process [106].  Special attention should be given to the detector rim, the region most prone to 
discharges.  Therefore,  the  electric  field  strength  in  the detector  at  high  ionization densities  is  determined 
not only by capacity matrix but also by currents [106]. Since the radiation damage may be accelerated by 
sparks,  discharges  and  photoelectric  feedback,  in  designing  of  gas  detector  one  should  aim  at  the  lowest 
possible electric field distribution (gas gain) compatible with the functional requirements. 

6.3. Aging vs. size of the irradiated area and gas flow 

The  dependence  of  the  detector  lifetime  on  the  size  of  the  irradiated  area  was  observed  in  all  types  of 
gaseous detectors (e.g. wire counters, MPGD, RPC). The increase of the aging rate in the direction of the 
serial  gas  flow,  as  shown  in  Fig.6,  means  that  aging  should  be  viewed  as  a  non-local  and  intensity 
dependent  phenomena.  Some  of  the  long-lived  aggressive  free  radicals  may  diffuse  within  the  irradiated 
detector  area  and  react  with  other  avalanche  generated  dissociative  products,  construction  and  electrode 
materials thus enhancing aging effects with increasing usage of the gas. These observations seem to be the 
most critical when trying to extrapolate the aging behavior from laboratory tests to large-scale detectors and 
require to avoid gas distribution systems that supply many chambers by a serial flow. 

Figure 6. Progressive deterioration of efficiency to MIP particles in the direction of the serial gas flow in the HERA-B prototype muon 
chambers for three different accumulated charges: 80 mC/cm, 170 mC/cm and 270 mC/cm of the wire in an Ar/CF4/CH4 (67:30:3). 
The whole wire length (500 mm) was irradiated. The maximum of irradiation intensity corresponds to x~250 mm. [35].  

   It  is  rather  intuitive  that  the  aging  rate  typically  decreases  with  increasing  gas  flow,  since  it  tends  to 
sweep  away  the  harmful  radicals  and  ions,  leading  to  polymer  growth  [3,5].  However,  this  trend  is  not 

 

arXiv:physics/0403055 v1 9 March 2004 

always correct, for example, if the polymerization is triggered by the impurities in the input flow stream. 
By  increasing  the  gas  flow,  more  of  this  ingredient  is  available  to  speed  up  the  aging  process;  such 
tendency was in some cases observed in gas detectors [16]. 

6.4. Some Useful Guidelines for the Construction and Operation of Gaseous Detectors in High 

Luminosity Experiments 

   Over  the  last  decade  considerable  progress  has  been  made  on  understanding  of  basic  rules  for 
construction and operation of radiation-hard gaseous detectors, which might help to prevent or at least to 
suppress the aging rate to an acceptable level [1-3,5]; the most important ones are summarized as follows. 
1) Carefully choose construction materials - radiation hardness and outgassing properties are of a primary 
importance.  There  are  clearly  many  ‘bad’  and  a  lot  of  ‘usable’  materials  -  perform  tests  to  match  your 
specific requirements. 
2) Only a limited choice of aging resistant gases can be successfully used in the high intensity experiments: 
noble  gases,  CF4,  CO2,  O2,  H2O.  Hydrocarbons  are  not  trustable  for  long-term  high  rate  experiments. 
Operational  problems  could  be  aggravated  by  using  poor  quencher  CO2  and  by  the  very  high 
aggressiveness of CF4 dissociative products. 
3) Validate your assembly procedures, which must include  maximal cleanliness for all processes, quality 
control for all system parts and personnel training (no greasy fingers, no polluted tools, no spontaneously 
chosen  materials  installed  in  the  detector  or  gas  system  in  the  last  moment,  before  the  start  of  real 
operation). 
4) Carefully control any anomalous activity in the detector, such as dark currents, changes of anode current 
and  remnant  activity  in  the  chamber  when  beam  goes  away.  If  aging  effects  are  observed  despite  all 
precautions, add oxygen-based molecules to inhibit/relief/cure polymerization of hydrocarbons; operation 
with CF4 decreases the risk of Si polymerization. 
5)  Special  care  has  to be  taken  to the surface  conductivity  of  electrodes,  since  it  is  closely  related  to  the 
capability of operating at large ionization densities. The resistivity of the microscopic insulating layer on 
the  metallic  cathode  surface  defines  the  maximum  rate  capability  of  the  detector  before  the  onset  of 
electron field emission from the cathode, which starts if the rate of ionic charge neutralization across the 
dielectric film is smaller than the rate of ion charge built-up. Detectors, which use insulators (MSGC, CsI, 
RPC) may face a new domain of aging: radiation-induced increase of surface resistivity of electrodes and 
supporting structures due to ionic currents; this may trigger Malter-type breakdowns [8]. 

7.  Conclusions and Perspectives 

   A centenary after the invention of the basic principle of gas multiplication, gaseous detectors are still the 
first choice whenever the large area particle detection of medium spatial accuracy is required. The recent 
invention of the micro-pattern gas detectors promises to extend the applicability of gaseous detectors to the 
precision  tracking  at  high  counting  rates  in  hostile  environments,  an  area  previously  accessible  only  to 
silicon  detectors.  The  main  properties of gaseous  and  silicon  microstrip detectors,  fulfilling  all  necessary 
requirements concerning high-rate capability and radiation hardness in the intermediate region from 20 cm 
up to 2 m from the beam pipe, are summarized in Table 3. Both Micromegas and GEM detectors already 
achieve  a  position  resolution  of  better  than  70  µm,  timing  resolution  of  ~10  ns  and  signal  to  noise  ratio 
(S/N)  of  more  than  20  at  full  efficiency  in  high-intensity  beams.  In  the  laboratory  tests  using  narrow 
readout strips and low-diffusion gas fillings, a time resolution ~ 5 ns and the spatial resolution of ~ 15-30 
µm,  close  to  that  of  the  silicon  detectors,  was  measured.  The  most  exciting  prospect  for  future 
developments could be pixel readout structures for these kinds of devices.

   The dramatic increase in charge, which is expected to be accumulated on sensing electrodes in the new 
high-rate  experiments,  posed  much  more  stringent  constraints  on  the  radiation  hardness  of  materials  and 
gas mixtures, and basic rules for construction and operation of gaseous detectors, than even thought before. 
No general recipe can be given for the radiation hardening of the detectors. The aging tests should include 
an  extended  study  of  ‘large-scale’  final  prototype  chambers,  exposed  over  the  full  area  to  a  realistic 
radiation profile (particle type and energy, ionization density, irradiation rate). It is of primary importance 
to vary the operating parameters systematically in order to investigate their possible influence on the aging 
performance.  In  order  to  exclude  statistical  fluctuations  of  unknown  nature  and  to  provide  the  reliable 
estimate for the detector lifetime, the radiation tests should be carried out with several detectors irradiated 
under identical conditions. Ten years of intensive research aiming to match the needs of high luminosity 
colliders have demonstrated that if properly designed and constructed, gaseous detectors can be robust and 
stable in presence of high rates and heavily ionizing particles.

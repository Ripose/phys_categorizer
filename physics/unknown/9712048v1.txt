A general technique is developed for calculating func-
tional determinants of second-order diﬀerential operators with
Dirichlet, periodic, and antiperiodic boundary conditions. As
an example, we give simple formulas for a harmonic oscillator
with an arbitrary time-dependent frequency. Here our result
is a generalization of Gel’fand-Yaglom’s famous formula which
was restricted to Dirichlet boundary conditions. Apart from
the generalization, our derivation is more transparent than
theirs, the determinants requiring only knowledge of the clas-
sical trajectories. Special properties of operators with a zero
mode are exhibited. Our technique does not require the cal-
culation of the spectrum and is as simple as Wronski’s method
for Green functions.

1. Evaluation of Gaussian path integrals is necessary in
many physical problems. In particular, it appears in all
semi-classical calculations of ﬂuctuating systems. Typ-
ically, it leads to the problem of calculating the func-
tional determinant of a second-order diﬀerential opera-
tor [1]. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, a ﬁrst gen-
eral solution of this problem was given by Gel’fand and
Yaglom [2] based on the lattice approximation to path
integrals in the continuum limit. Their result was ex-
pressed in terms of a simple diﬀerential equation for the
functional determinant. In subsequent work [3]– [6], the
formalism was generalized to a variety of diﬀerential op-
erators and boundary conditions based on the concept of
zeta-function regularization [7]. Unfortunately, Gel’fand-
Yaglom’s method becomes rather complicated for pe-
riodic and antiperiodic boundary condition relevant in
quantum statistic (see Section 2.12 in [1]). In the periodic
case there is, moreover, a zero mode causing additional
complications.

In this paper we present a systematic method for ﬁnd-
ing functional determinants of linear diﬀerential opera-
tors which is based on Wronski’s simple construction of
Green functions. Our method is simpler than those used
in the previous approaches, since the determinants are
expressed entirely in terms of a classical trajectory. Fur-
thermore, for ﬂuctuation operator with a zero mode, a
case frequently encountered in semiclassical calculations,
the special treatment of this mode becomes transparent.

2. The typical ﬂuctuation action arising in semiclassical
approximations has a quadratic Lagrangian of the form

(cid:3)

Physically, this Lagrangian describes a harmonic oscil-
lator with a time-dependent frequency Ω(t). The path
integral for such a system was studied in several papers
[8]– [11]. For such an oscillator, both the quantum me-
chanical propagator and the thermal partition function
contain a phase factor exp[iScl(x)] and are multiplied by
a pre-exponential ﬂuctuation factor proportional to

F (tb, ta) ∼

Det ˜K (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(2)

t − Ω2(t) ≡ K0 − Ω2(t) is the kernel of
where K1 = −∂2
the second variation of action S(x) along the classical
path xcl(t). The linear operator K1 acts on the space of
twice diﬀerentiable functions y(t) = δx(t) on an interval
t ∈ [ta, tb] with appropriate boundary conditions. These
are Dirichlet boundary conditions y(ta) = y(tb) = 0
in the quantum-mechanical case, and periodic (antiperi-
odic) y(tb) = ±y(ta), ˙y(tb) = ± ˙y(ta) in the quantum sta-
tistical case. In these two cases the operator ˜K may be
chosen as K0 or K0 − ω2
0, respectively, where ω0 is a
time-independent oscillator frequency. The ratio of de-
terminants (2) arises naturally from the normalization of
the path integral and is well-deﬁned [1]. Furthermore, for
such an operator we may assume the Fredholm property

DetK1
Det ˜K

= Det ˜K −1K1

(3)

thus neglecting multiplicative anomalies [12]. Since the
operator ˜K −1K1 is of the form I +B, with B an operator
of the trace class, it has a well-deﬁned determinant even
without any regularization.

To calculate F (tb, ta), we introduce a one-parameter
family of operators Kg depending linearly on the param-
eter g : Kg = K0 − gΩ2(t), 0 ≪ g ≪ 1. The above prop-
erty (3) allows us to make use of the well-known formula
log Det ˜K −1Kg = Tr log ˜K −1Kg to relate the g-derivative
of the logarithm of the ratio (2) to the trace of the Green
function of the operator Kg as follows

∂g log Det ˜K −1Kg = −Tr Ω2(t)Gg(t, t′),

the Green function being deﬁned by

Gg(t, t′) = [−∂2

t − gΩ2(t)]−1δ(t − t′).

(4)

(5)

Formula (4) is valid provided we regularize the trace
on the right-hand side, if it diverges, via zeta-functions

1

i λ−s, where the sum runs over all eigenval-
ζ(s) =
ues. It is convergent for suﬃcinetly large s and deﬁned
for smaller s by analytic continuation (see [7]). Then,
for each member of the g-family, DetK1 = exp[−ξ′(0)].
Another proof of (4) can be found in [3].

By integrating (4), we obtain for the ratio of functional

where C = Det ˜K −1K0 is a g-independent constant. This
is our basic formula to be supplemented by an appropri-
ate boundary condition to Eq. (5) for the Green function
as we shall now discuss in detail.

3. A general solution of Eq. (5) is given by advanced
or retarded Green functions as follows

G−

g (t, t′) = G+

g (t′, t) = Θtt′ · fg(t, t′),

(7)

where Θtt′ = Θ(t− t′) is Heaviside’s function and fg(t, t′)
is a combination

fg(t, t′) =

[ηg(t)ξg(t′) − ξg(t)ηg(t′)]

The constant Wg is the time independent Wronski de-
terminant Wg = ηg ˙ξg − ˙ηgξg. The solution (7) is not
unique since it leaves room for an additional general so-
lution of the homogeneous equation (9) with an arbi-
trary coeﬃcients. This freedom is removed by appro-
priate boundary conditions. Consider ﬁrst the quantum
mechanical case which requires Dirichlet boundary condi-
tions y(tb) = y(ta) = 0 for the eigenfunctions y(t) of K1,
implying for the Green function the boundary conditions

Gg(ta, t′) = 0,
Gg(t′, tb) = 0,

formed from the solutions ηg(t) and ξg(t) at arbitrary
g 6= 1. Note that these solutions are restricted only the
condition (12). The result is unique and well-deﬁned,
assuming the absence of a zero mode ξ(t) of the operator
K1 with Dirichlet boundary conditions ξa = ξb = 0. Such
a mode would cause problems since according to (10), the
Wronski determinant W would vanish at the initial point,
and thus for all t.

Excluding zero modes, we obtain from (8):

Tr Ω2(t)Gg(t, t′) =

dt Ω2(t)fg(t, ta)fg(tb, t).

To perform the time integral on the right hand side, we
make use of the identity

Ω2(t)ξ(t)η(t) = ∂t[ ˙ηg(t)∂gξg(t) − ηg(t)∂g ˙ξg(t)].

(15)

This follows from Eq. (9) for η(t, g), and an analogous
equation for ξ˜g(t), after multiplying the ﬁrst by ξ˜g(t) and
the second by ηg(t), and taking their diﬀerence. In the
limit ˜g → g, we obtain (15) from the linear term in ˜g − g.
Inserting (15) into (14), we see that

Tr Ω2(t)Gg(t, t′) = −∂g log

In a time-sliced quantum mechanical path integral, the
determinant of K0 is ﬁnite and has the value [1]

The operator ˜K in the ratio (2) is equal to K0, and the
constant C in Eq. (6) is unity. After imposing (10), the
Green function is uniquely given by Wronski’s formula:

Gg(t, t′) =

Θtt′fg(t′, ta)fg(tb, t) + Θt′tfg(t, ta)fg(tb, t′)
fg(ta, tb)

,

DetK0 = tb − ta,

so that we obtain

DetK1 =

[η1(ta)ξ1(tb) − η1(tb)ξ1(ta)]
W1

,

where

fg(ta, tb) =

DetΛg

which coincides with Gel’fand-Yaglom’s formula (see Sec-
tion 2.7 in [1]).

For a harmonic oscillator with a time-dependent fre-
quency Ω(t) it is convenient to relate the set of two in-
dependent solutions ηg(t) and ξg(t) of Eq. (9) at g = 1,

xcl(t) = xaξ(t)+xbη(t) satisfying the endpoint conditions
xcl(ta) = xa and xcl(tb) = xb. Since this construction
satisﬁes ηa = ξb = 0, ηb = ξa = 1 and W = ˙ξb = − ˙ηa,

(23)

Inserting (21) into (18), we obtain for the harmonic os-
cillator with a time-dependent frequency Ω(t) the ratio
of functional determinants

(24)

where subscripts a and b indicate avaluation at t = ta
and t = tb, respectively. We check this representation
by expressing the right-hand side in terms of the clas-
sical action Scl(x). With the same normalization as in
(19), this yields the well-known one-dimensional Van-
Vleck formula

DetK1 = −M [∂2Scl(xa, xb)/∂xa∂xb]−1

(25)

To end this section we note that the ratio (18) can
easily be extended to the stochastic case where the ﬁnal
position of the trajectory x(t) remains unspeciﬁed. To
this end we consider Eqs. (14) and (15) with a variable
upper time t′ ≥ t ≥ ta. Then the eigenvalues of the op-
erator K −1
0 K1 become functions of t′ with a phase factor
produced by each passage through a focal point.

4. Consider now periodic (antiperiodic) boundary con-
ditions y(tb) = ±y(ta), ˙y(tb) = ± ˙y(ta) for the eigenfunc-
tions y(t) of the operator K1 and the for Green function

(35)

For a harmonic oscillator with a time-dependent fre-
quency Ω(t), we use again the representation (21) for ξ(t)
and η(t) in terms of the functions p(t) and q(t), which in

Integrating the left-hand side by parts and taking into
account the conditions (40) and (41) gives

in the limit ε → 0. We therefore remove the zero mode
from the determinant using the standard method [17].

In the periodic case, formula (48) is useful for semiclas-
sical calculations of path integrals processing nontrivial
classical solutions such as solitons or instantons [1].

the function p(t) is periodic and even

Inserting now the solutions (21)

minants for a harmonic oscillator with a time-dependent
frequency Ω(t) with periodic boundary conditions

(38)

and with antiperiodic boundary conditions

Note that only formula (24) for the Dirichlet boundary
condition has been known in the literature (see [8]– [11]).
The periodic and antiperiodic formulas (38) and (39) are
new, although they have had predecssors on the lattice
[15]. Moreover, our new derivation has the advantage
of employing only Wronski’s simple construction method
for Green functions. The general expressions for the func-
tional determinants (20), (33) and (35) are form-invariant
under an arbitrary changes (η, ξ) → (˜η, ˜ξ) of the basic set
η(t) and ξ(t) of two independent solutions of the homo-
geneous equation (9).

5. Contrary to the case of a harmonic oscillator with
a time-dependent frequency Ω(t), consider now the situ-
ation where the operator K1 has a zero mode. In this case
we may assume the frequency Ω(t) in Eq. (1) the special
form Ω2(t) = V ′′(xcl(t))/M with a potential V (x), al-
lowing reﬂecting the translation invariance of the theory
with Lagrangian (1) along the time axis [16]. Let ξ(t)
be the corresponding eigenfunction satisfy the condition
ξa = 0 as well as ξb = 0. As mentioned above, the con-
dition (12) is now violated, making Eq. (11) undeﬁned,
and it is impossible to construct two independent solu-
tion ξ(t) and η(t) since their Wronski determinant would
be equal to zero indentically W = ηa ˙ξa − ˙ηaξa ≡ 0 due
to the boundary conditions (10). Since the Wronski con-
struction is not applicable we replace

by the regularized conditions

ξb = 0,

ξa = 0

Abstract

In the JLC/NLC X-band linear collider, it is essential to
reduce the long-range dipole wakefields in the accelerator
structure to prevent beam break up (BBU) and emittance
degradation. The two methods of reducing the long-range
wakefields are detuning and damping.  Detuning reduces
the wakefields rapidly as the dipole modes de-cohere but,
with  a  finite  number  of  modes,  the  wakefield  will  grow
again  as  the  modes  re-cohere.  In  contrast,  damping
suppresses the wakefields at a longer distance.  There are
two  principal  damping  schemes:  synchronous  damping
using  HOM  manifolds  such  as  that  used  in  the  RDDS1
structure  and  local  damping  similar  to  that  used  in  the
CLIC  structure.  In  a  locally  damped  scheme,  one  can
obtain  almost  any  Q  value,  however,  the  damping  can
have significant effects on the accelerating mode. In this
paper, we present a medium local-damping scheme where
the  wakefields  are  controlled 
the  BBU
requirement  while  minimizing  the  degradations  of  the
fundamental  rf  parameters.  We  will  address  the  load
design  and  pulse  heating  issues  associated  with  the
medium damping scheme.

  1 INTRODUCTION

The Next Linear Collider (JLC/NLC) [1,2] will provide
a luminosity of 1034cm-2sec-1 or higher at a center of mass
of 1 TeV. To obtain this luminosity, the NLC linacs must
accelerate bunch trains with lengths of 266 ns and currents
that  are  over  half  an  ampere  while  preserving  the  very
small  beam  emittances. 
  Dipole  wakefields  in  the
accelerator 
structures  can  cause  beam  emittance
degradation  and  beam-break-up.  It  is  essential  in  the
collider design to reduce the long-range dipole wakefields
to  prevent  the  beam  breakup  instability  (BBU).  The  two
methods  of  reducing  the  long-range  wakefields  are
detuning and damping of the dipole modes.  Detuning can
reduce the wakefields rapidly by causing the modes to de-
cohere  however  it  is  less  effective  at  longer  time  scales
because  the  finite  number  of  modes  can  re-cohere.  In
contrast, damping can be used to control the wakefields at
a longer distance.

There  are  two  primary  damping  schemes  for  traveling
wave structures: the synchronous coupling scheme as used
in  the  RDDS1[3]  design  and  the  local  damping  scheme
used in the CLIC[4] structure design. In the local damping
scheme,  each  cell  is  coupled  to  four  radial  wave-guides
via  coupling  irises.  Heavy  damping  of  the  dipole  mode
can  be  achieved  with  the  proper  design  of  the  iris

openings however this can have significant effects on the
fundament mode and cause reductions of Q0 and the shunt
impedance. As was demonstrated in the CLIC 15 GHz test
structure  [4]  where  the  dipole  Q1  was  about  20,  the  Q0
reduction  of  the  fundamental  mode,  due  to  the  damping
irises,  can  be  as  high  as  20%.  This  reduces  the  rf
efficiency  and  may  lead  to  unwanted  effects  such  as
pulsed heating.

For  the  NLC  X-band  linacs,  we  propose  a  medium
damping scheme with a Q1 of a few hundred as means of
solving the rf efficiency and the pulse heating limitations.
In  this  paper,  we  address  some  of  the  design  issues  for
locally damped structures at X-band. We will also discuss
the  design  of  compact  loads  for  the  medium  damped
structures  to  minimize  the  physical  size  associated  with
the local damping and thereby reduce the cost.

2  LOCALLY DAMPED STRUCTURE
The numerical studies in this paper will be based on a
structure  design  with  1500  phase  advance  per  cell.  The
idea of going to  a  higher  phase  advance  is  to  reduce  the
group velocity while keeping a large structure aperture[5];
this  may  reduce  the  damage  due  to  rf  breakdown  [6]

For high efficiency, the structure will use rounded cell
profiles, which have 12% higher Q0 and shunt impedances
than that in the standard disk-loaded waveguide structures.
In  the  locally  damped  structure,  the  dipole  wakefield
generated  by  the  beam  is  coupled  out  via  four  higher-
order-mode  (HOM)  couplers,  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  The
coupler  wave-guide  propagates  only  the  dipole  mode
frequencies  and  is  cut-off  at  the  fundamental  mode
frequency. The coupler is narrower in height than the cell
length and is positioned off the symmetry plane of the cell
in 
that  modes  which  have
TE(M)111-like symmetry can also be damped.

the  axial  direction  so 

The  damping  properties  of  the  cell  are  determined  by
the coupling iris to the damping waveguide. To determine
the  damping  requirements  for  the  structure,  numerical
simulations  using  LIAR[7]  were  performed  to  study  the

BBU as a function of the dipole damping. The wakefields
were calculated from the uncoupled frequencies and kick
factors  for  the  structure  parameters  in  Table  1.    This
simple  model  must  be  updated  in  the  future  with  a
wakefield  calculated  from  the  coupled  mode  frequencies
and  kick  factors  however  it  provides  a  good  estimate  of
the expected performance.  The tracking was done for two
different beam configurations: 95 bunches having a 2.8 ns
bunch spacing and 1.0x1010e/bunch; 190 bunches having a
1.4 ns bunch spacing and 0.75x1010e/bunch.  In both cases,
the train length was 266 ns and the initial oscillation was
1σ
y ≈  5.7  m  in  standard  NLC
linac.    In  addition,  both  were  tracked  using  1  slice  per
bunch  –  this  eliminates  the  effect  of  the  initial  energy
spread  and  the  short-range  wakefield  which  will  reduce
the  BBU.  The  results  are  listed  in  Table  2  and  indicate
that  a  Q1  of  less  than  750  is  acceptable  for  the  X-band
design. With a Q1 of over 1000, the emittance of the beam
starts to deteriorate quickly.

The damping Q1 of the dipole mode was studied using
MAFIA [8]. The HOM coupler waveguide dimensions for
the model are 12 mm by 3 mm. The  coupling  iris  opens
the full height of the HOM waveguide but the width of the
iris is adjusted to obtain the required Q1 values while the
thickness was kept at 0.6mm. The Q of the dipole mode is
very sensitive to the iris opening as is shown in Fig. 2. It
is  also  clear  from  the  plot  that  very  low  Q’s  can  be
obtained with the local damping scheme.

However, 

the  coupling 

iris  also  perturbs 

the
fundamental mode, degrading the fundamental Q0 and the
shunt  impedance.  The  degradation  is  almost  inversely
proportional  to  the  dipole  Q1.  The  cause  of  the  Q0
reduction is the higher wall-loss in a small region around
the  iris  opening  resulted  from  the  current  concentration

due  to  the  iris  perturbation.  This  wall-loss  power  may
cause  excessive  local  pulsed  heating,  which  must  be
minimized to avoid damage from the thermal stresses.

at different iris openings.

3  PULSED HEATING

 The Q0 reduction of the fundamental mode is due to the
perturbation of the HOM coupling iris to the fundamental
mode current. The power-loss distribution of the medium
damped  structure  was  calculated  using  Omega3P[9]
running  on  NERSC  T3E  and  SP2  supercomputers.  A
snap-shot of the wall-loss is shown in Fig. 3. The red spot
in  a  small  region  around  the  HOM  coupler  indicates
higher  power  density  which  can  cause  an  excessive
temperature rise during the rf pulse. A temperature rise of
1200C has been shown [10] to be detrimental to the copper
surface.  Thus,  it  is  important  to  design  the  structure  to
maintain  the  heating  at  a  safe  level.  Knowing  the  power
density  from  the  Omega3P  simulation,  the  temperature
rise  can  be  calculated  using  the  formula  given  in
[10,11,12]

The design strategy is to damp the dipole mode only as
much as needed to prevent  BBU  thereby  minimizing  the
loss in Q0 and shunt impedance. This approach leads to a
medium damping with a Q1 of a few hundred. We chose a
Q1  of  500  for  the  current  medium  damped  structure
design.  With  such  a  scheme,  it  is  expected  that  the  rf
heating temperature rise will be acceptable.

 4 HOM LOAD FOR MDS

The loads  for  the  medium  damped  structure  should  be
simple and compact in geometry. The ideal load would be
an adiabatically tapered load which has the advantages of
a  broad  bandwidth  and  an  insensitivity  to  the  material
variation. However, the adiabatically tapered load is long;
at the X-band dipole frequency, the load would be roughly
50  mm.  The  disk  diameter  with  such  loads  would  be  at
least  155  mm  which  becomes  cumbersome  as  shown  in
Fig. 4.

right) compact load using quasi-adiabatic quasi-resonant
approach, fits in cell OD of 85 mm.

We  took  an  approach  of  using  quasi-adiabatic  quasi-
resonant  tapers  for  the  loads.  Using  either  MAGO  (ε=
9.2(1-j0.13)) or AlN+SiC (ε=25(1-j0.35)) lossy materials,
the load can be designed to be shorter than 20 mm. With
these  loads,  the  cell  can  have  diameter  of  85  mm.  For
example, the cell geometry with the MAGO load is shown
in Fig. 4.

As  anticipated,  the  compact  load  design  has  a  finite
bandwidth which is shown in Fig. 5. Full cell simulations,
which include the cell, the HOM waveguide and the loads,
suggested that a reflection better than 0.1 is adequate for
the medium damped structure. The bandwidth of the load
within this reflection limit is shown to be about 1.0 GHz.
To cover the whole bandwidth of the dipole modes in the
structure,  a  few  different  load  designs  are  needed  along

Figure 5. Load reflection at first and third dipole
band frequencies.

5 VACUUM AND STRUCTURE BPM

Vacuum  manifolds  can  be  easily  incorporated  to  the
design. A 6mmx10mm manifold, shown in Fig. 4, cutting
through  the  damping  waveguide  provides  additional
longitudinal vacuum conductance with little effect on the
load design.

Unlike the RDDS type structures, the structure BPM for
the locally damped structure is not readily available. The
present  thought  is  to  utilize  probes  in  the  damping
waveguides  to  monitor  the  dipole  signals.  A  few  such
probes  are  needed  to  determine  the  alignment  of  the
structure.  Another  option  is  to  couple  the  vacuum
manifold weakly to the rf in the damping waveguide and
pick  up  the  signals  in  the  manifold  for  beam  position
analysis. Further studies are needed on these issues.

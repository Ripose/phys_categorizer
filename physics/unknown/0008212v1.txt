SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE PROJECT

Robert L. Kustom, SNS/ORNL, Oak Ridge, TN

Abstract

The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is being designed,
constructed, installed, and commissioned by the staff of
six national laboratories, Argonne National Laboratory,
Brookhaven  National  Laboratory,  Jefferson  National
Accelerator  Laboratory,  Lawrence  Berkeley  National
Laboratory,  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory,  and  Oak
Ridge National Laboratory. The accelerator systems are
designed  to  deliver  a  695  ns  proton-pulse  onto  a
mercury target at a 60-Hz repetition rate and an average
power  of  2-MW.  Neutron  moderators  that  will  convert
the  spallation  neutrons  into  slow  neutrons  for  material
science  research  will  surround  the  target.    Eighteen
neutron beam lines will be available for users, although
initially,  only  10  instruments  are  planned.  The  Front-
End  Systems  are  designed  to  generate  a  52  mA,  H-
beam  of  minipulses,  68%  beam  on,  32%  beam  off,
every 945 ns, at 2.5 MeV for 1 ms, 60 times a second.
The  Front-End  systems  include  a  RF  driven,  volume-
production  ion  source,  beam  chopping  system,  RFQ,
and  beam  transport.  The  linac  consists  of  a  drift  tube
linac  up  to  86.8  MeV,  a  coupled-cell  linac  to  185.7
MeV,  and  a  superconducting  RF  linac  to  the  nominal
energy  of  1  GeV.  The  design  of  the  superconducting
section  includes  11  cryomodules  with  three,  0.61-beta
cavities per cryomodule and 15 cryomodules with four,
0.81-beta cavities per cryomodule, with space to install
six more 0.81-beta cryomodules. The accumulator ring
is designed for charge exchange injection at full energy
and  will  reach  2.08x10E+14  protons/pulse  at  2-MW
operation.  The  goal  is  to  reduce  uncontrolled  beam
losses to less than 1x10E-4. A detailed overview of the
accelerator  systems  and  progress  at 
the  various
laboratories will be presented.

1  INTRODUCTION

The  Spallation  Neutron  Source  (SNS)  facility  under
construction  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  is
designed  to  generate  pulses  of  neutrons  at  intensities
well  beyond  any  of  the  world’s  existing  spallation
neutron  sources.  The  accelerator  systems  are  designed
to  deliver  a  695  ns  proton-pulse  onto  a  liquid  mercury
target at a 60-Hz repetition rate with an average proton
beam power of 2-MW.  The target station will have 18
shutters  that  ultimately  will  be  able  to  support  24
neutron  instruments.  An  initial  complement  of  ten
instruments is planned at the start of operation in 2006.
A site master plan is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Site Master Plan.

The SNS is being designed and built as a partnership of
six  DOE  national  laboratories:  Lawrence  Berkeley
(LBL)  in  California,  Los  Alamos  (LANL)  in  New
Mexico, Argonne (ANL) in Illinois, Oak Ridge (ORNL)
in  Tennessee,  Brookhaven  (BNL)  in  New  York,  and
Thomas  Jefferson  (JLAB)  in  Virginia.  The  Front-End
Systems (FES) are the responsibility of LBL. The drift
tube linac (DTL),  coupled-cell linac (CCL), and warm
parts  of  the  linac,  including  the  end-to-end  physics
design  and  RF  system  design  are  the  responsibility  of
LANL. The superconducting RF cavities, cryomodules,
and  cryogenic  equipment  are  the  responsibility  of
JLAB. The accumulator ring and high-energy transport
lines  between  the  linac  and  the  ring  (HEBT)  and  the
ring  and  the  target  (RTBT)  are  the  responsibility  of
BNL. The target station and conventional facilities are
the  responsibility  of  ORNL.  The  neutron  instruments
are  the  responsibility  of  ANL.  Project  integration,

2  TECHNICAL DESIGN OF THE

ACCELRATOR SYSTEMS

2.1 Front-End Systems

The Front-end Systems (FES) are designed to generate
an H- beam of mini-pulses with 68% on time, every 945
nanoseconds  for  a  period  of  1  millisecond  at  a  60  Hz
repetition  rate.  The  FES  include  a  RF  driven,  volume-
production  ion  source,  beam  chopping  system,  RFQ,  a
low-energy  beam  transport  (LEBT)  system,  and  a
medium-energy  beam  transport  (MEBT)  system.  The
FES must deliver 52 ma at 2.5 MeV at the input to the
drift  tube  linac.  The  key  FES  parameters  are  listed  in
Table 2[1].

The  H-  ion  source  utilizes  a  2-MHz,  RF  driven
discharge  to  generate  the  plasma.  The  plasma  is
confined  by  a  multi-cusp  magnet  configuration.  A
magnetic  dipole  filter  separates  the  main  plasma  from
the  region  where  low-energy  electrons  generate  the
negative  ions.  A  heated  cesium  collar  surrounds  the
production  chamber.  Electrons  are  removed  from  the
ion  beam  by  a  deflecting  field  from  a  dipole  magnet
arrangement in the outlet plate of the plasma generator.
The  ion  source  is  tilted  with  respect  to  the  LEBT  to
compensate for the effect the electron-clearing field has
on the ion beam.

The  LEBT  structure  is  based  on  an  earlier  design  [2]
that  proved 
the  viability  of  purely  electrostatic
matching. There are two einzel-lens in the LEBT. The
second  is  split  into  quadrants  that  can  be  biased  with
D.C.  and  pulsed  voltages  to  provide  angular  steering
and pre-chopping. Chopping voltages of +- 2.5 kV and
300 ns are rotated around the quadrants. Corrections in
transverse  beam  displacement  are  achieved  by  moving
the ion source and LEBT with respect to the RFQ [3]. A
schematic of the ion source and LEBT that will be used
for  startup  of  the  facility  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Its
performance goal is 35 ma, and it will be a significant
step towards developing the full 65 mA estimated for 2
MW operation.

The RFQ will accelerate beam from 65 keV to 2.5 MeV
with an expected transmission efficiency of better than
80%.  It  is  built  in  four  modules  using  composite
structures  with  a  GlidCop  shell  and  four  oxygen-free-
copper vanes. The length of the RFQ is 3.72 m.

There  are  a  total  of  eight  modules.  Four,  5-megawatt
klystrons  drive  the  CCL.  Each  klystron  drives  two
modules. The peak power is 11.4 Mw and the maximum
accelerating  field  on  axis  is  3.37  MV/m  (Eo T).  The

The design frequency is 402.5 MHz. Peak surface fields
reach  1.85  Kirkpatrick  and  require  800  kW  during  the
pulse. The output of RFQ is directed into the MEBT [4].
Matching  from  the  RFQ  to  DTL  is  performed  in  the
MEBT. Final chopping of the bunches is also performed
in the MEBT.

2.2 Linac Systems

The linac consists of a drift tube linac up to 86.8 MeV, a
coupled-cell  linac  (CCL)  up  to  185.7  MeV,  and  a
superconducting linac up to a nominal energy of 1 GeV.
The  superconducting  linac  is  divided  into  a  medium-
beta  cavities  and  high-beta  cavity  sections  [5].  The
medium-beta  cavity  is  designed  for  a  geometric  b
  of
0.61,  and  the  high-beta  cavity  is  designed  for  a
geometric  b
  of  0.81.  The  nominal  transition  energy
between  the  medium  and  high  beta  sections  is  378.8
MeV.

The DTL consists of six separate tanks each driven by a
402.5  MHz,  2.5  Mw  klystron.  The  focusing  lattice  is
FFODDO with a six  b
  period.  The  focusing  magnets
are permanent magnet quadrupoles with constant GL of
3.7 kG and a bore radius of 1.25 cm. There are one-b
inter-tank  gaps  for  diagnostics.  Empty  drift  tubes
contain  BPMs  and  steering  dipoles.  There  are  144
quadrupoles and 216 drift tubes in the DTL. The energy
gain  per  real  estate  meter  is  2.3  MeV/m  in  the  DTL.
Key parameters for the DTL are listed in Table 3.

The  CCL  operates  at  805  MHz.  There  are  eight
accelerating  cells  brazed  together  to  form  a  segment.
Six  segments  are  mounted  and  powered  together  as  a
single module using 2.5-b
 coupling cells, one of which
is powered. A 3-D schematic of Module 1 is shown in

l
l
l
energy  gain  per  real  estate  meter  is  1.7  MeV/m.  The
transverse  focusing  system  is  a  FODO  lattice  in  the
CCL. The bore radius goes from 1.5 cm to 2.0 cm. The
total length of the CCL is 55.12 m.

The  high-energy  end  of  the  linac,  above  185.7  MeV,
uses superconducting cavities. The design is based on a
conceptual  design  study  completed  by  scientists  from
many institutions and  lead by Yanglai Cho [6].

 of 0.81, defined as the high-b

Two different superconducting cavity designs are used
in  the  SNS  linac,  one  with  a  geometric  b
  of  0.61,
defined  as  the  medium-b
  cavity,  and  the  other  a
geometric b
 cavity. There
are  six  cells  per  cavity  in  the  medium  and  high-b
sections.  More  than  six  cells  per  cavity  results  in
excessive phase slip for a particular beta and fewer than
six cells per cavity results in inefficient use of real estate
and  higher  cost  due  to  increased  parts  count.  The
cavities  will  be  fabricated  using  4  mm-thick  Nb  with
stiffening  or  reinforcement  plates.  The  initial  design
assumes  a  peak  field  of  27.5  MV/m,  +-2.5  MV/m,
however,  with  conditioning  and  future  processing,
higher gradients are expected. The design value for Qo
is 5x10E+9, and the loaded Q design value is 5x10E+5.
The  effective  accelerating  gradients  are  10.5  MV/m  in
the 0.61-b
 section.
The design values for Lorentz  detuning,  referenced  to
the  geometric  accelerating  field,  are  2.9  Hz/(MV/m)^2
in the medium-b
 cavities and 1.2 Mz/(MV/M)^2 in the
high-b
 design value for microphonics
is  +-100  Hz.  Cold  tuning  will  allow  the  cavities  to  be
taken off resonance by 100 kHz. Each cavity is driven
by a single, 550 kW klystron operating at 805 MHz [7].

2.3  Accumulator Ring

The  accumulator  ring  for  SNS  is  a  FODO  arc  with
doublet  straight  sections  [8].  This  lattice  has  four-fold
symmetry with zero dispersion in the straight sections.
A plan view of the ring and transport lines is shown in
Fig.  7.  The  ring  circumference  is  248  m.  The  zero
dispersion regions include two-6.85 meter sections and
one  long  12.5  meter  section.  Each  of  the  four  straight
sections has a dedicated function. The injection straight
includes  the  injection  septum  magnet,  eight  bump
magnets  for  horizontal  and  vertical  injection  painting,
the  stripper  foil,  and  dump  septum.  The  collimator
section  includes    moveable  scattering  foils  and  three
fixed  collimators.  The  extraction  section 
includes
fourteen full-aperture-ferrite, extraction kicker magnets
and a Lambertson  extraction septum magnet.  The rise
time of the extraction kickers is 200 ns. The RF section

b
has three first-harmonic cavities operating at 1.058 MHz
and  a  second  harmonic  cavity.  The  total  voltage
generated  at  the  first  harmonic  is  40  kV  and  at  the
second harmonic is 20 kV.

At  2  MW  operation,  2.08x10E14  protons  are
accumulated in a 650-700 ns  bunch in 1060 turns. The
injection  process  is  direct  charge  exchange  using  a
painting  scheme  to  achieve  uniform  transverse  charge
distribution and a second harmonic RF system to spread
the beam more uniformly in the longitudinal  plane. The
expected fractional space-charge tune-shift is 0.14. The
goal  for  gap  cleanliness  is  10E-4  beam-in-gap/total
beam.

Achieving low uncontrolled beam loss, less than 10E-4,
is  a  key  element  of  the  accumulator  ring  design.  The
design of the injection process, collimation scheme, RF
system  design,  emittance  and  acceptance  ratio,  and
extraction  system  are  all  designed  to  achieve  this  low
level of beam loss.

LANL.  A 
linac
procurements, such as the 402.5 MHz, 5 MW klystrons,
402.5  MHz  circulators,  and  transmitters  for  klystron
control, have been awarded. The copper model for the
0.61-b
 single cell has been brazed and is being tested at
JLAB.  Six-cell  Nb  cavities  are  being  fabricated.  The
procurement  of  Nb  for  construction  of  all  the  cavities
and much of the hardware for the cryogenic facility and
cryomodule production has been awarded. Procurement
of ferrite for the ring RF systems has been awarded and
sample  is  being  tested.  Ring  dipole,  quadrupole,  and
corrector magnets have tested, and procurement of these
magnets has  started at BNL.

In  summary,  major  construction  has  started  and  the
project  expects  to  meet  the  goal  of  first  beam  injected
into the accumulator ring by July  2004,  and  first  beam
on target by January 2005.

3  PROJECT STATUS

Major  construction  has  started  on  the  conventional
facilities  and  the  technical  components.  Excavation  on
the site is currently about 40% complete. Much of the
building  and  utility  detailed  design  has  started  and
major  civil  procurements,  such  as  bulk  concrete  and
structural steel, are well along in the procurement cycle.
The start-up ion source and all electrostatic LEBT have
been  successfully  operated  at  LBL  at  42  mA,  greater
than  the  initial  35  mA  needed  for  the  start  of
commissioning. The first of the RFQ modules has been
fabricated  and  tested  at  full  field  and  pulse  length.  A
cold  model  of  the  DTL  is  in  fabrication  and  a  cold

We  outline  a  method  to  slow  paramagnetic  atoms  or 

molecules  using  pulsed  magnetic  fields.  We  also  discuss 

the  possibility  of  producing  trapped  particles  by  adiabatic 

deceleration  of  a  magnetic  trap.  We  present  numerical 

simulation  results 

for  the  slowing  and  trapping  of 

molecular oxygen. 

The control of atomic and molecular motion has been a long-

standing scientific goal with many potential technological applications 

ranging from atomic lithography to matter-wave interferometry for 

inertial sensing1.  The standard method to date for controlling atomic 

motion has been laser cooling.  Although this approach is very 

successful, it has been limited to the alkalis, alkaline earths, meta-stable 

noble-gas atoms and a few others species.  Most species of technological 

interest (such as ferromagnetic atoms and semiconductor atoms) are not 

amenable to laser cooling due to their complex internal structure.   

Other methods that do not rely on laser cooling include the pulsed 

electric field slower for polar molecules2, the pulsed optical field slower3, 

and crossed molecular beam slowing by billiard like collisions4. 

Mechanical control methods include a spinning supersonic source5, a 

moving magnetic mirror6 and the slowing of helium atoms by elastic 

reflection from a receding crystal mounted on a rotor7,8.  

We consider in this paper a new and quite general approach for 

creating slow cold atom and molecular beams: atoms will be slowed in a 

time-dependent magnetic field where low-field seekers are forced to climb 

a magnetic hill, losing kinetic energy in the process.  

In this paper, we outline the basic elements of the proposed 

method and indicate our experimental progress towards this goal with 

realistic parameters.  We start from a description of the supersonic 

beam.  We discuss the direct magnetic deceleration of atoms, followed by 

the concept of a moving magnetic trap that is decelerated to adiabatically 

slow trapped atoms or molecules.  We finally discuss possible 

applications of this method. 

Supersonic Beams 

Atomic beams are traditionally created by allowing gas to escape 

from a source with a small aperture and collimating the output.  In the 

dilute-gas regime, where the mean free path is larger than the aperture 

size, the resulting beam has a very broad distribution in velocity as well 

as angle.  As the pressure is increased in the source the resulting beam 

becomes very monochromatic and directional.  Supersonic expansion of 

the atoms as they escape from the aperture leads to these properties, 

and such beams have become important tools in physical chemistry9.  To 

reach the required pressures of several atmospheres, noble gases are 

typically used as the primary gas and they are "seeded" with another gas 

which is carried along. It is possible to seed almost any element into the 

supersonic beam using the process of laser ablation. 

The characteristics of the beam are critical for the proposed 

slowing and the parameters in this paper are based on a pulsed 

supersonic nozzle developed by Even et al.10,11 that offers a pulse 

duration as short as 10 µs FWHM with a repetition rate of 40 Hz, 

combined with cryogenic operation. The resulting beam has a brightness 

of 4 x 1023 atoms/sr/sec, an order of magnitude better than any source 

reported to date.   

 

 

Magnetic Deceleration of Atoms 

 

We propose that paramagnetic atoms can be slowed using a pulsed 

magnetic field. This is in a complete analogy with the pulsed electric field 

decelerator which has been used to slow polar molecules2.  Most atoms in 

the periodic table have a permanent magnetic moment allowing the 

control of the atomic motion using magnetic fields. An early example of 

such control is the splitting of an atomic silver beam in a Stern-Gerlach 

experiment12.  The principle of magnetic deceleration is conceptually 

simple: low field seekers lose kinetic energy by moving into the high 

magnetic field region at the center of the electromagnetic coil. When the 

atom reaches the top of the magnetic “hill” the magnetic field is suddenly 

switched off.  Due to conservation of energy the amount of the kinetic 

energy lost is equal to the Zeeman energy shift13,

where gs is the Landé factor, µβ is the Bohr magneton, MJ is the 

projection of the total angular momentum on the quantization axis and H 

is the magnetic field.  

The key question is whether short pulses of large magnetic field 

can be generated to stop an atomic beam over a distance of less than 1 

meter.  We have developed a miniature electromagnetic coil, which is 

able to deliver 2-3 Tesla magnetic fields throughout a 100 µsec pulse, 

according to our calculations. Based on our simulations, we predict that 

a supersonic molecular beam of O2 can be slowed from 250 m/s to 50 

m/s using 54 pulsed magnetic stages that span 76 centimeters.

Electromagnetic coil design 

The electromagnetic coil design is inspired by the solenoid valve 

used to pulse the supersonic nozzle.  The cross section view of the coil is 

shown in Figure 1. It has 30 turns (5×6 layers) of 0.5 mm diameter 

copper wire and a 3 mm diameter bore. The copper windings are 

enclosed in a Permendur alloy shell. Permendur has a saturation 

magnetization of 2.3 Tesla14 and allows us to achieve the highest ratio 

between magnetic flux and current density. We present the calculated 

axial and transverse magnetic fields of our coil in Figure 2. We use non-

linear finite element analysis to take the magnetic saturation of 

Permendur into account. 

According to our estimations a current density of 1·109 Amp/m2, 

corresponding to 200 Amps, will produce a peak magnetic flux density of 

2.1 Tesla. 

The transverse magnetic potential is well approximated by a 

parabolic potential with a depth of 0.4 Tesla (Figure 2 b). The transverse 

field component focuses and guides the low field seekers during the 

slowing process by forming an effective magnetic guide.

Magnetic slowing simulation  

 

Molecular oxygen is one of a few molecules that have a permanent 

magnetic moment in the ground state. It can be introduced into the 

supersonic beam by mixing it with a heavier carrier gas such as Xenon. 

The ground electronic state of molecular oxygen is a paramagnetic triplet 

(S=1) state, 3Σg

+. High intensity magnetic fields split the ground state 

oxygen into the three magnetic sub-level states with spin projections Ms = 

1, 0 and -1 (within Paschen-Back approximation). The low field seeker, 

Ms=1, atoms are slowed by the pulsed magnetic fields while Ms=0 atoms 

remain unaffected and Ms=-1 atoms are defocused.  

To simulate the slowing of molecular oxygen, we numerically 

integrate the classical equations of motion using the magnetic fields 

obtained via finite element analysis. We model the electromagnetic coil 

switching as an exponential function having a time constant of 7 µsec.  

The simulated oxygen beam has an initial mean velocity 250 m/s with a 

standard deviation of 25 m/s. Our simulations only include those atoms 

within two standard deviations of the mean velocity. The standard 

deviation of the beam divergence angle is 0.1 rad and the standard 

deviation of the nozzle opening time is taken to be 15 µsec(corresponding 

to 35 µsec  FWHM pulse).

detector, Ldetector, is varied according to the number of the coils. 

 

A schematic drawing of our simulated magnetic slower setup is 

presented in Figure 3. The distance between the supersonic nozzle and 

the first coil is 0.5 meters, the distance between coils (center-to-center) is 

14.1 mm, and the distance from the last coil to the detector is 0.5 m, 

0.25 m, and 0.05 m for 20, 48 and 54 coils respectively. We choose the 

timing of our coils such that the molecules with an initial velocity of 250 

m/s lose the largest amount of kinetic energy per stage and are thus 

slowed the most effectively. We present the calculated arrival time 

distributions at the 1 cm diameter detector in Figure 4. The plots include 

arrival time calculations for all three possible Ms states and show that 

the mean velocity of oxygen can be reduced to 50 m/s after 54 slowing 

stages.  The effective slowing is limited to the molecules that are within 

±2 m/s of the mean velocity and only about 1 % of the detected 

molecules are slowed.

 Moving magnetic trap 

 

In principle, our proposed magnetic decelerator would be able to 

stop the atomic beam and enable atom transfer into a magnetic trap.  A 

similar process has been demonstrated to produce electrostatically 

trapped polar molecules.  This trapping technique is a two stage process 

that requires deceleration before trapping.   

We propose to combine trapping with deceleration. Cold and fast 

atoms from the supersonic beam would be trapped in a co-moving, 

decelerating magnetic trap. The initial trap velocity is equal to the atomic 

beam velocity. Since the beam temperature in the moving frame is very 

low (under 100 mK), we can trap a large number of atoms. The number 

of atoms that “survive” the slowing process depends on the deceleration 

value.

activated to create a moving magnetic trap. The direction of the current in each coil is 
represented by an arrow. 

 

Our proposed electromagnetic coil configuration for the adiabatic 

slowing process (see Figure 5) is similar to the setup used by Greiner et 

al.15 to transfer laser cooled atoms over macroscopic distances. In our 

case the unit cell consists of three anti-Helmholz coil pairs that create a 

moving 1mm3, 0.4 Tesla deep magnetic trap. The magnetic field 

minimum can be translated by changing the current ratio between two of 

the anti-Helmholz coil pairs.

Ms=1 state. The acceleration values are -4·103 m/s2 (a), -1·104 m/s2 (b), and -4·104 m/s2 
(c). 
 

We simulate the adiabatic slowing process for the case of Ms=+1 

state of molecular oxygen. We use the same supersonic beam properties 

as in the previous section, however our calculations here are 1D. We 

switch the magnetic trap around the atoms instantaneously and slow it 

down with a constant deceleration. The resulting velocity distributions 

are shown in Figure 6. As expected, the number of slowed molecules 

depends on the deceleration. The trapping efficiency is about 5 % in the 

case of the largest acceleration of -40,000 m/sec2. The total length of 

such an adiabatic decelerator device would be about 80 cm. 

 

 

Conclusions and Future Directions 

In this paper we propose a novel deceleration method to slow 

paramagnetic atoms or molecules using pulsed magnetic fields. Our 

simulations predict that the mean velocity of molecular oxygen can be 

reduced from 250 m/sec to 50 m/sec in 54 stages, which would make a 

magnetic decelerator 76 cm in length. We also propose a method to 

adiabatically slow trapped particles to zero mean velocity by decelerating 

a moving magnetic trap formed by a series of anti-Helmholz coil pairs.  

More generally, the realization of a magnetic slower would provide a way 

to create cold atomic beams as well as trapped atoms for many species in 

the periodic table that until now could not be controlled.

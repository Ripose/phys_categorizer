Abstract. 
       It  is  pointed  out  that  the  usual  derivation  of  the  well-known  Maxwell 
electromagnetic equations holds only for a medium at rest. A way in which 
the  equations  may  be  modified  for  the  case  when  the  mean  flow  of  the 
medium  is  steady  and  uniform  is  proposed.  The  implication  of  this  for  the 
problem of the origin of planetary magnetic fields is discussed.

Introduction. 
 
       Maxwell’s  electromagnetic  equations  are  surely  among  the  best  known 
and  most  widely  used  sets  of  equations  in  physics.  However,  possibly 
because  of  this  and  since  they  have  been  used  so  successfully  in  so  many 
areas for so many years, they are, to some extent, taken for granted and used 
with  little  or  no  critical  examination  of  their  range  of  validity.  This  is 
particularly true of the two equations 
 

and

Both  these  equations  are  used  widely  but,  although  the  point  is  made  quite 
clearly in most elementary, as well as more advanced, textbooks, it is often 
forgotten  that  these  equations  apply  only  when  the  medium  involved  is 
assumed to be at rest. This assumption is actually crucial in the derivation of 
these  equations  since  it  is  because  of  it  that  it  is  allowable  to  take  the 
operator  d/dt  inside  the  integral  sign  as  a  partial  derivative  and  so  finally 
derive  each  of  the  above  equations.  This  leaves  open  the  question  of  what 
happens if the medium is not at rest?  
 
      As  is  well  known,  for  a  non-conducting  medium  at  rest,  Maxwell’s 
electromagnetic equations, when no charge is present, reduce to

Therefore, in this special case, provided the medium is at rest, both E and H 
satisfy  the  well-known  wave  equation.  However,  it  has  been  shown 
[Thornhill, 1993] that, if the mean flow is steady and uniform, and, therefore, 
both homentropic and irrotational, the system of equations governing small-
amplitude  homentropic  irrotational  wave  motion  in  such  a  flow  reduces  to 
the equation 
 

2f    =  (1/c2)D2f /Dt2, 
 
which  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  convected,  or  progressive,  wave 
equation. The question which remains is, for the case of a medium not at rest, 
should Maxwell’s electromagnetic equations be modified so as to reduce to 
this progressive wave equation in the case of a non-conducting medium with 
no charge present?

and,  as  stated  previously,  interchange  the  derivative  and  the  integral.  This 
operation  may  be  carried  out  only  for  a  medium  at  rest.  However,  if  the 
medium is moving, then the surface S in the integral will be moving also, and

the mere change of S in the field  B  will cause changes in the flux. Hence, 
following  Abraham  and  Becker  [1932],  a  new  kind  of  differentiation  with 
respect to time is defined by the symbol  (cid:1)B  as follows: 
 

                                                   

.
B dS

                                                  (a)

Here,  (cid:1)B  is a vector, the flux of which across the moving surface equals the 
rate of increase with time of the flux of  B  across the same surface. In order 
to find  (cid:1)B , the exact details of the motion of the surface concerned must be 
known.  Suppose  this  motion  described  by  a  vector  u ,  which  is  assumed 
given for each element dS of the surface and is the velocity of the element. 
 
      Let S1 be the position of the surface S at time (t - dt) and S2 the position at 
some later time t. S2 may be obtained from S1 by giving each element of S1 a 
displacement  udt . The surfaces  S1 and  S2, together with the strip produced 
during the motion, bound a volume  dt u dS.(cid:1)
 
      The rate of change with time of the flux of B across S may be found from 
the difference between the flux across S2 at time t and that across S1 at time  
(t - dt); that is

where the subscript indicates the time at which the flux is measured. 
 
      The divergence theorem may be applied at time t to the volume bounded 
by S1, S2 and the strip connecting them. Here the required normal to S2 will 
be  the  outward  pointing  normal  and  that  to  S1  the  inward  pointing  normal. 
Also, a surface element of the side face will be given by  ds u·
dt . Then, the

be  noted,  though,  that,  for  more  general  flows,  the  expression  for  (cid:1)B   is 
somewhat more complicated.

      These four modified Maxwell equations lead to both E and H satisfying 
the above mentioned progressive wave equation, as they surely must. 
 
The origin of planetary magnetic fields. 
 
       It  is  conceivable  that  use  of  these  modified  Maxwell  electromagnetic 
equations  could  provide  new  insight  into  the  problem  of  the  origin  of 
planetary  magnetic  fields.  This  is  a  problem  which  has  existed,  without  a 
really satisfactory explanation,  for many years. It would seem reasonable to 
expect  all  such  fields  to  arise from the same physical mechanism, although 
the  minute  detail  might  vary  from  case  to  case.  The  mechanism  generally 
favoured as providing the best explanation for the origin of these fields was 
the  dynamo  mechanism,  although  the  main  reason  for  its  adoption  was  the 
failure  of  the  alternatives  to  provide  a  consistent  explanation.  However, 
Cowling  [1934]  showed  that  there  is  a  limit  to  the  degree  of  symmetry 
encountered  in  a  steady  dynamo  mechanism;  this  result,  based  on  the

traditional  electromagnetic  equations  of  Maxwell,  shows  that  the  steady 
maintenance of a poloidal field is simply not possible - the result is in reality 
an  anti-dynamo  theorem  which  raises  difficulties  in  understanding  the 
observed symmetry of the dipole field.  
 
      Following  Alfvén  [1963],  it  might  be  noted  that,  in  a  stationary  state, 
there  is  no  electromagnetic  field  along  a  neutral  line  because  that  would 
· E,  and  so  a time varying B. The induced electric 
imply  a  non-vanishing  (cid:209)
field  v· B  vanishes  on  the  neutral  line  since  B  does.  Thus,  there  can  be  no 
electromotive force along the neutral line, and therefore the current density in 
the  stationary  state  vanishes,  the  conductivity  being  infinite.  On  the  other 
· B  does  not  vanish  on  the  neutral  line.  By  Maxwell’s  usual 
hand,  (cid:209)
equations,  the  non-vanishing  (cid:209)
· B  and  the  vanishing  current  density  are  in 
contradiction  and  so  the  existence  of  a  rotationally  symmetric  steady-state 
dynamo  is  disproved.  However,  this  conclusion  may  not  be  drawn  if  the 
modified Maxwell equations, alluded to earlier, are used, since, even in the 
steady state where the partial derivatives with respect to time will all be zero, 
the equation for (cid:209)
 

· B will reduce to

and there is no reason why this extra term on the right-hand side should be 
identically  equal  to  zero.  Also,  the  non-vanishing  of  (cid:209)
· E  will  not  imply  a 
time varying B since, once again, there is an extra term -v.(cid:209) B remaining to 
equate with the (cid:209)
· E. It follows that an electromagnetic field may exist along 
the  neutral  line  under  these  circumstances.  Hence,  no  contradiction  occurs; 
instead, a consistent system of differential equations remains to be solved.

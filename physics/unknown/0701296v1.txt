Abstract 
Electricity  in  the  atmosphere  provides  an  ideal  topic  for  educational  outreach  in 
environmental  science.  To  support  this  objective,  a  simple  instrument  to  measure  real 
atmospheric  electrical  parameters  has  been  developed  and  its  performance  evaluated.  This 
project  compliments  educational  activities  undertaken  by  the  Coupling  of  Atmospheric 
Layers  (CAL)  European  research  collaboration.  The  new  instrument  is  inexpensive  to 
construct  and  simple  to  operate,  readily  allowing  it  to  be  used  in  schools  as  well  as  at  the 
undergraduate  University  level.  It  is  suited  to  students  at  a  variety  of  different  educational 
levels,  as  the  results  can  be  analysed  with  different  levels  of  sophistication.  Students  can 
make measurements of the fair weather electric field and current density, thereby gaining an 
understanding  of  the  electrical  nature  of  the  atmosphere.  This  work  was  stimulated  by  the 
centenary of the 1906 paper in which C.T.R. Wilson described a new apparatus to measure 
the electric field and conduction current density.  Measurements using instruments based on 
the  same  principles  continued  regularly  in  the  UK  until  1979.  The  instrument  proposed  is 
based on the same physical principles as C.T.R. Wilson's 1906 instrument.

1. Introduction 
The  phenomena  of  atmospheric  electricity  provide  an  ideal  topic  for  stimulating  lectures, 
talks  and  laboratory  demonstrations.  Educational  measurements  in  the  real  atmosphere  are, 
however,  more  troublesome  to  arrange,  as  the  life-threatening  hazards  associated  with 
lightning  generally  prevent  their  use  in  quantitative  demonstrations.  The  safer  fair  weather 
circumstances  require  highly  sensitive  apparatus  to  detect  the  weak  electric  fields  always 
present  in  such  conditions.  In  the  early  days  of  atmospheric  electricity,  the  mechanical 
electrometer and flame probe sensor provided a simple and direct method for illustrating the 
existence  of  the  fair  weather  electric  field.  A  ready  example  of  this  was  provided  by 
Lord Kelvin (Thomson, 1859) 
 

“The author gave the result of a determination which he had made, with the assistance 
of  Mr  Joule,  on  the  Links,  a  piece  of  level  ground  near  the  sea,  beside  the  city  of 
Aberdeen, about 8am on the preceding day (September 14), under a cloudless sky, and 
with a light north-west wind blowing, with the insulating stand of the collecting part of 
the apparatus buried in the ground, and the electrometer removed to a distance of 5 or 
6 yards and connected by a fine wire with the collecting conductor. The height of the 
match  was  3  feet  above  the  ground,  and  the  observer  at  the  electrometer  lay  on  the 
ground to render the electrical influence of his own body on the match insensible. The 
result  showed  a  difference  of  potentials  between  the  earth  (negative)  and  the  air 
(positive) at the match equal to that of 115 elements of Daniel’s battery, and, therefore, 
at that time and place, the aërial  electromotive force amounted to that of thirty-eight 
Daniel’s cells.” 

 
Such  an  approach  would  have  straightforwardly  demonstrated  the  existence  of  a  positive 
potential  gradient2  in  fair  weather  conditions,  but  comparable  apparatus  to  replicate  this 
approach - particularly the electrometer - is hard to find in a modern school or undergraduate 
laboratory. 
 
A  simple  educational  instrument  to  provide  stimulating  observations  of  the  fair  weather 
electrical  atmosphere  is  the  goal  here.  The  approach  and  principles  of  the  instrument  are 
described3.  The  method  used  has  classical  origins  in  atmospheric  electricity,  based  on  an 
instrument  devised  by  C.T.R.Wilson,  described  in  a  paper  published  about  century  ago 
(Wilson,  1906).  Wilson’s  instrument  measured  the  potential  gradient  (PG)  and  vertical  air-
earth current density JS simultaneously. This approach was so successful that it was used by 
the  Met  Office  at  their  Kew  Observatory,  near  London  between  1931  and  1979.  The  site, 
instrument, method of measurement and observations obtained have been recently described 
by Harrison and Ingram (2005).  
 
The new educational instrument presented here operates on the same principles as the Wilson 
instrument, but uses modern sensitive electronics to produce a small and portable instrument 
which  is  readily  constructed.  A  feature  is  that  the  copper  circuit  board  it  employs  includes 
both the printed sensor electrode and the simple signal processing electronics. The instrument 
measures  both  the  PG  and  the  vertical  air-earth  current  density,  and  is  called  the  Electric 

                                                 
2 Converted to modern units (assuming each zinc-copper Daniel cell generates an emf of 1.08V), the Potential 
Gradient near Aberdeen, Scotland at 8am on the 14th September, 1859 would have been +137V.m-1.

Potential  gradient  And  Current  (EPAC)  sensor,  to  highlight  the  two  atmospheric  electrical 
parameters it measures.  
 
2. Operating principle 
The  EPAC  instrument  operates  by  determining  the  potential  on  an  isolated  horizontal  plate 
electrode,  which  is  mounted  flush  with  the  ground  in  dry  conditions.  The  potential  is 
measured  using  a  simple  semiconductor  electrometer  (e.g.  Harrison,  1996),  with  respect  to 
the  potential  of  the  ground.  As  for  Wilson’s  apparatus,  the  measurements  can  be  used  to 
determine the PG from the magnitude of the induced voltage, and, from the rate of change of 
the induced voltage and the electrode plate’s area, the air-earth current flowing. 
 
If a horizontal conducting plate electrically isolated from the ground is exposed to an electric 
field  a  charge  will  be  induced  on  its  surface.  This  charge  is  proportional  to  the  field  it  is 
exposed to by the following equation: 
 
(1), 
where Q is the induced charge,  (cid:0)
0 the relative permittivity, A the plate’s surface area and F 
the electric field the plate is exposed to. The change in voltage on the plate resulting from this 
induced charge is related to the electrical capacitance of the system by the relationship

 with  Vstep  being  the  change  in  voltage  of  the  plate  and  C  is  the  capacitance.  Combining 
equations (1) and (2) produces the following:            

By measuring the change in voltage of a conducting plate as it is exposed to the atmosphere it 
is  therefore  possible  to  calculate  the  PG  using  equation  (3)  once  Vstep  has  been  calibrated 
experimentally for a known PG or if A and C are determined for the instrument.  
 
For as long as the plate is exposed upwards to the atmosphere, it will collect positive electric 
charge brought downwards by the air-earth current density JS. This charge will increase the 
potential on the plate by a voltage Vcharge defined by the following equation:     

with  t  the  time  for  which  the  plate  is  exposed  to  the  atmosphere.  This  equation  has  been 
derived from equation (2) with Q substituted by the total volume of charge carried to the plate 
by current density JS to the plate’s area A, in time t. 
 
If the plate is shielded from the atmospheric PG and JS, it will remain at a constant potential 
if  there  is  no  leakage.  However,  when  the  shielding  is  removed,  the  potential  will 
immediately increase, with the voltage step proportional to the atmospheric PG in accordance 
with equation (3). The plate potential will then rise slowly under the influence of JS, as well 
as fluctuating due to changes in PG. 
 
The EPAC sensor provides a sensing plate of fixed geometry and electrode capacitance, and 
an electrometer to measure the potential on the plate. 
 
3. Implementation of the EPAC sensor 
The  prototype  EPAC  sensor  was  constructed  using  copper-coated  fibreglass  circuit  board, 
measuring 9cm by 14cm, with copper surfaces on both sides. The lower side is earthed (see 

 

 

 

 

3 

(cid:215)
figure 1a), and the upper side carries the printed sensing plate electrode. As with the original 
Wilson  design,  a  guard  ring  was  etched  around  the  plate  electrode,  and  driven  at  the 
measured electrode potential to suppress current leakage. 
 
The potential on the upper sensing plate is measured with respect to ground using a sensitive, 
ultra-high impedance electrometer chip, which draws a negligible bias current from the plate. 
This electrometer voltmeter serves only to provide a measurement of the plate voltage at high 
impedance,  to  drive  low  impedance  measurement  instruments  with  only  unit  gain.  This 
therefore  provides  a  drive  voltage  for  the  guard  electrode.  An  output  potential  divider  is 
provided so that the typical voltages induced under fair weather atmospheric conditions fall 
with the range of typical digital voltmeter. No filtering is required before the op-amp, as any 
high-frequency  noise  is  removed  by  capacitive  smoothing  inherent  in  the  system  (e.g.  the 
capacitance  provided  by  the  sensing  electrode  being  in  close  proximity  to  the  ground).  A 
schematic of the electrometer voltmeter system is given in figure 1b. 
 
To measure PG using the EPAC sensor, the sensor was placed on flat, open ground as close 
to the surface as possible (to avoid perturbing the ambient field). An earthed metal cover was 
placed approximately 30cm above the plate and the output voltage read. Then the shield was 
removed  and  the  voltage  induced  in  accordance  with  equation  (3)  measured  immediately 
upon exposure. This voltage step (Vstep) was proportional to the PG. After a short (of order 
one minute) time of plate exposure, the shield was replaced over the sensor and the output 
voltage measured again. The difference in voltage between the initial reading and the final is 
Vcharge and can be used to find JS from equation (4). 
 
4. EPAC sensor calibration and comparison 
Calibration of the PG aspect of the EPAC sensor was achieved by measuring the voltage step 
Vstep before and after plate exposure, which was compared with corresponding values of PG 
at 1m made nearby by a calibrated electrostatic field mill (Bennett and Harrison, 2006a). The 
proportionality is linear and is shown in figure 2.  
 
The equation of the line of best fit was used to convert the voltage step into a value of PG. 
The  close  similarity  between  the  field  mill  (FM)  and  EPAC  derived  PG  can  be  seen  in 
figure 3.  The  instruments  were  separated  horizontally  by  approximately  10m  and  2m 
vertically  during  the  calibration.  The  small  deviations  from  linearity  between  the  two 
instruments  seen  in  figure  2  may  therefore  be  attributed  to  spatial  variation  in  atmospheric 
space charge and air of different conductivity carried by turbulent eddies, the effects of which 
are always evident and are the main cause of observed high-frequency variation in PG during 
fair-weather. 
 
From the calibration, it is possible to derive the instrument capacitance C, which was 235pF. 
Because of the fixed geometry of the circuit board and printed electrodes, C is expected to be 
similar for other devices made to the same specification. If C is to be calculated theoretically, 
the relative permittivity and thickness of the circuit board must be determined (the two plates 
effectively  act  as  a  parallel-plate  capacitor,  with  the  circuit  board  being  the  medium  in 
between). 
 
The value of C is required for the determination of JS by equation (4). Using this value for C, 
the one minute mean JS value was derived using the EPAC sensor, by exposing the plate for 
one minute. These values are shown as a short time series in figure 4. The mean value for JS 
of  1.5pAm-2  during  the  sampling  period  was  compared  to  JS  measured  directly  by  other 

 

4 

instruments  (principally  the  Air-Earth  Current  Pyramid,  detailed  by  Bennett  and  Harrison 
2006b) nearby, and found to agree closely. Although the EPAC sensing plate is raised above 
Earth potential due to the arrival of charge during exposure, the increase is small (order 3mV 
for one minute exposure) compared to atmospheric PG (order 100V/m) so in this respect the 
sensing plate will not differ significantly from Earth potential, permitting the corresponding 
JS measurement to be a close approximation of that arriving at the surface. 
 
The PG and JS are therefore calculated as follows: 
 

1.  Place the EPAC sensor parallel to the ground and cover with an earthed  conducting 

plate to shield the sensor from ambient PG and JS. Record the output voltage. 

 
2.  Remove the shield so the sensing electrode is fully exposed to the environment and 
record the subsequent change in output voltage. This is Vstep and is used to calculate 
PG by rearrangement of equation (3). 

3.  Continue  exposure  of  the  sensor  for  a  known  duration,  then  cover  again  with  the 
earthed  shield  and  note  the  difference  between  this  voltage  and  the  initial  voltage 
found  at  stage  1  before  exposure.  This  is  Vcharge  and  is  used  to  calculate  JS  by 
rearrangement of equation (4). 

 
5. Conclusions 
The  EPAC  sensor  provides  a  simple  approach  to  measurement  of  atmospheric  electrical 
properties. Measurements of PG and JS using the EPAC sensor agree well with those made 
using  more  sophisticated  instruments,  making  this  sensor  ideal  for  providing  in-situ  spot 
recordings of atmospheric electrical measurements.  
 
The EPAC sensor is well suited for use as a tool for educational outreach as it is inexpensive 
and  can  be  safely  operated  by  school  pupils  to  measure  real  parameters  in  environmental 
electrostatics. It relies on direct, straightforward principles of measurement that can be easily 
explained, as well as providing insights into electronic construction techniques. 
 
There  are  many  possible  applications  for  the  results  from  the  EPAC  sensor,  such  as 
investigation of the electric field surrounding charged objects in the lab (so no environmental 
PG present), induced charge on droplets, or perturbation of the ambient PG in the vicinity of 
grounded objects (i.e. trees, buildings etc). If measurements are taken over a sufficiently long 
time  period,  the  qualitative  variations  of  atmospheric  PG  due  to  (1)  local  aerosol  number 
concentration  (i.e.  increased  PG  during  times  of  increased  local  traffic  activity  or  the 
presence of fog) or (2) the large variation in PG during the overhead passage of convective 
cloud  (which  may  also  result  in  negative  PG  being  observed)  can  be  seen.  The  correlation 
between PG  and JS could be investigated, with the concept of  a radiating  electrostatic  field 
and “dynamic” fields generated from the flow of charge through a resistor (such as for PG). 
Furthermore, students may be invited to suggest the origin of the downward-flowing air-earth 
current  density  JS,  leading  to  discussion  of  the  concept  of  the  global  atmospheric  electric 
circuit.

earthed, with the upper face providing a sensing electrode, insulated from earth. The area of 
the electrode is 8x10-3m2. When exposed to the atmospheric potential gradient, a voltage is 
induced on the sensing electrode, which is proportional to the PG. As long as the electrode is 
exposed, charge accumulated due to the air-earth current will raise the electrode’s potential.

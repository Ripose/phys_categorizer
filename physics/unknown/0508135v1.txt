Abstract.  A  new  physical  way  of  communication,  communication  by  the  inherent  background

noise,  is  proposed  which  does  not  need  net  energy  transfer  in  the  information  channel.  The

communicator devices do dissipate energy however they do not emit net energy into the channel,

instead of that, they modulate the parameters of inherent spontaneous fluctuations in the channel.

The  new  method  can  use  two  different  mechanisms,  thermal  noise  (Johnson-Nyquist  noise)  for

classical communication, and vacuum fluctuations/zero point energy (quantum uncertainty noise) for

quantum communication. The strongest advantage of the method that this is apparently the most

hidden (stealth)  way  of  communication,  because  it  is  using  the  inherent  background  noise  for

communication, therefore it is extremely difficult or impossible to discover its presence. Moreover,

with proper wave-based arrangements, the sender and the receiver can easily detect eavesdropper
activities, so that the eavesdropper is detected as soon as she extracts a single bit of information, thus

the  security  of  the  method  is  at  least  as  good  or  better  than  the  security  of  quantum

communication/quantum  key  distribution  schemes.  Finally,  concerning  practical  applications,

environmental noise, out of the fundamental/inherent fluctuations, can also be used for this kind of

communication provided that is sufficiently stationary.

Keywords:  Stealth  communication;  eavesdropper  detection;  thermal  noise;  zero-point  energy;

vacuum fluctuations; communication by noise.

1. Introduction

1.1 Zero-signal-power communication is not energy-free communication

In this paper we show that it is possible to communicate via an information channel without putting

net energy into the channel. This surprising result is achieved by the modulation of the parameters of

equilibrium-thermal or zero-point-quantum fluctuations in the channel. Thus this communication is

using the inherent energy fluctuations, which is called channel noise in the literature, to carry the

information.

First of all, important fact is emphasized, namely that this method is very different from the so-called

energy-free  communication. There have been some discussion and debate by prominent scientists

about the possibility of energy-free communication [1,2]. However it is important to note that the

methods and issues presented in this paper are very different because:

1.  The method presented in this paper is utilizing and detecting the equilibrium-thermal  and/or

zero-point-quantum  fluctuations  in  the  information  channel.  All  the  debated  arrangements

mentioned  above  make  strong  efforts  to  suppress these fluctuations below the detection limit

where they do not disturb the information processing any more.

2.  Even if there is no net energy communicated in the channel, there is a huge energy, much more

than kT/bit dissipated in the communicator devices at the sender and receiverâ€™s side; dislike in

the debated arrangements mentioned above, where there is an effort to regain the energy spent.

We do not make any effort to regain any type of energy used to run the system.

In conclusion, the debate [1,2] about energy-free communication, though intriguing, is irrelevant

here.

1.2 Examples of fluctuations, which can be utilized for communication: thermal and zero-point

fluctuations

After realizing the fact that the inherent fluctuations can be used for communication, the realization

and the various solutions are self-evident and straightforward. From the many possibilities, we show

only a few examples in this paper. Without the restriction of generality, we demonstrate the idea by

voltage fluctuations described by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), in the classical physical

and the quantum physical limits, respectively. According to the FDT [3-8], the generalized Johnson-

Nyquist formula of equilibrium thermal noise in the voltage can be written as:

where  Su ( f )   is  the  power  density  spectrum  of  the  voltage  noise  on  the  open-ended  impedance
]  is the real part of the impedance; and h is the Planck constant. The Planck number
N( f ,T )   is  the  mean  number  of  hf   energy  quanta  in  a  linear  harmonic  oscillator  of  resonance

,

which is  N( f ,T ) = kT /(hf )  for the classical physical range  kT >> hf  so that the mean energy in the

oscillator is  kT + 0.5hf , where the second term is the zero-point energy. The familiar thermal noise

voltage formula is valid in this classical limit, that is for the low frequency range  f << kT / h  , where
the first energy term dominates:

In the quantum limit, which is the high frequency limit  f >> kT / h  , the zero-point fluctuations can
be measured with a linear voltage amplifier:

Although  the  proper  physical  interpretation  of  Eq.  4  is  somewhat  debated  [5,7,8]  (weather  the

observed noise is an explicit zero-point fluctuation or if it is the manifestation of the uncertainty

principle, etc.), the validity of Eq. 4 for linear voltage amplifiers in the quantum limit is commonly

accepted,  confirmed  by  experiments  and  applied  in  engineering  [4,6,7].  Therefore,  because  the

practical existence of this quantum noise phenomenon in the voltage is a fact, the debate mentioned

above  is  irrelevant  for  the  present  paper,  and  here  we  can  take  Eq.  4  as  the  voltage  noise  of

impedances in the quantum range. It is however important to mention [6] that this noise is zero in a

photocell  or  other  detectors  which  are  detecting  particle  number  instead  of  field  amplitude  and

measure only the Planck radiation. Thus, we always envision a linear voltage amplifier input at the

receiver's side when we discuss quantum noise example in the present paper.

2. General scheme of zero-power classical communication

The  general  outline  of  the  zero-signal-power  communication  system  for  classical  information  is
shown in Fig 1. The   f << kT / h  classical physical condition holds and the impedance generating
the thermal noise of the channel (see Eq. 3) is modulated by the sender. The receiver detects the

signal, which is the modulation of the statistical properties such as spectrum, hidden correlations,

etc. in the thermal noise. Though controlling the communication devices requires energy, the signal

energy pumped into the channel and the net energy transfer between the sender and receiver is zero.

Note,  that  with  alternative,  wave-based  solutions,  the  sender  can  modulate  the  reflection  of

coefficient of the channel at his end and introduce time-correlations in the noise (see in Sections

6-7).

3. Simple (non-wave-based) example for the zero-power classical communication

An example of a simple realization of the zero-signal-power classical communicator can be seen in
Fig. 2. The information-bit is represented by the choice of two different impedance-bandwidths and
the  two  corresponding  thermal  noise  spectra  (see  Equation  3)  provided  by  the  two  different
capacitors  at  the  sender's  side  of  the  channel,  which  is  made  of  two  wires  of  short  length

L << cp / f , where  cp  is the propagation velocity of electromagnetic fields in the cable.  The noise
  

analyzer can measure power density spectra, zero-crossing frequency autocorrelation or other related

quantity.

The  advantage  of  the  method  shown  in  Fig.  2  is  that  for  everybody,  except  for  an  educated

eavesdropper,  it  looks  like  there  is  no  communication  in  the  channel  because  only  the  usual

background noise (thermal noise) is present and the signal power is zero. However the educated

eavesdropper with proper equipment and settings can observe that the high-cut-off frequency of the
thermal noise is switching between two distinct values.

4. General scheme of zero-quantum quantum communication

The general outline of the zero-signal-power communication scheme for quantum information is

shown  also  in  Figure  3,  with  the  condition  f >> kT / h . The impedance determining the spectral
properties of vacuum fluctuations in the channel (see Eq. 4) is modulated by the sender. Though

controlling the communication devices require many energy quanta, no quanta are sent through the
information channel and the energy transfer between the sender and receiver is zero. Similar solution

can  also  be  achieved  by  two  coupled  quantum  systems  one  at  the  sender's  side  and  one  at  the

receiver's side, respectively.

Concerning electronic solutions there is an apparent disadvantage compared to the classical schemes

described in Sections 2 and 3. The  kT << hfc  condition requires amplifying voltages at very high
frequencies or being and environment of very low temperature. Therefore this kind of electronic

quantum  communication  seems  to  be  more  relevant  for  communication  via  the  space  where  the

background  thermal  noise  temperature  is  around  2.7K.  However  heterodyne  techniques  such  as

TerraHertz or optical phase sensitive techniques may still be relevant.

5. Simple example for electronic zero-quantum quantum communication

The example outlined in Fig. 3 can also be used as a simple realization of the zero-quantum quantum

communicator provided that the  kT << hfc  condition holds,  fc is the upper cut-off frequency. The
information-bit  is  represented  by  the  choice  of  two  impedance-bandwidths  and  the  two

corresponding uncertainty-noise spectra, provided by the two different capacitors at the sender's side

of the channel made of two wires.

The  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  this  system  are  the  same  as  those  of  the  classical  system

described  in  Section  3.  An  extra  problem  is  the  need  of  using  low  temperature  and/or  high

frequency.

similar.

6. Wave-based solutions using modulation of reflection

For  the  sake  of  simplicity  and  practical  relevance,  we  restrict  ourselves  to  the  case  of  classical
thermal  noise  in  the  rest  of  the  paper,  though  considerations  about  the  quantum  case  would  be

Wave-based  arrangements  need  longer  cables  than  half  of  the  wavelength  corresponding  to  the

bandwidth, 

L >> cp / f . They can also be realized with the bandwidth modulation systems shown in
  

Fig. 2, however modulation of the reflection can be a more practical option.

Figure  4  shows  a  wave-based  arrangement  with  a  coaxial  cable  and  matching  resistor  at  the

receiver's end the modulation of the reflection at the sender's end. The detection of the information at

the  receiver's  side  needs  a  correlator  (a  multiplier  and  an  averaging  circuit)  and  a  delay  line  to

determine the value of the autocorrelation function at time equal to the time of return flight of the

wave  along  the  cable.  The  three  stages  of  the  switch  at  the  sender's  side  represent  a  three-level
information system: 1 no reflection (no correlation); 2 positive reflection (positive correlation); 3

negative  reflection  (anti  correlation).  Observing  the  reflection  properties  via  the  autocorrelation
function provides extraordinary sensitivity to detect possible eavesdropper activities because any
activity along the line will cause reflections at different time delays.

7. Microwave-based solutions for eavesdropper detection

Wave-based arrangements with microwaves and two parabola antennas. The arrangements at the
sender's and receiver's sides are the same as in Fig. 4, however the signal propagates in the space.

This arrangement has the highest sensitivity to detect an eavesdropper. The eavesdropper can couple

out a part of the signal-carrying-noise from the communication channel between the two antennas

however, she will always induce excess noise, when she uses a matched resistor closing Otherwise,

if she leaves the antenna wire ends open or shorted, she is causing excess reflection maxima/minima

in the correlation function at the receiver's device. Because the out-coupled signal-carrying-noise,

which has the same intensity as the useless thermal noise of the external space, out-coupling has to

be  a  significant  fraction  to  have  a  reasonably  good  statistics  of  the  detection.  What  is  most
important, the receiver will observe at least as large change on the autocorrelation function as the

signal detected by the eavesdropper. Thus, as soon as the eavesdropper detects a bit with a certain

probability, the receiver will detect the eavesdropper's presence with the same probability. Therefore

while the eavesdropper detects a single bit, the receiver detects the presence of the eavesdropper.

This  property  is  superior  to  known  quantum  key  distribution  schemes  where  the  eavesdropper's

presence can be detected only after she extracts a great number of bits provided the eavesdropper is

using a quantum amplifier.

8. Zero-signal-power communication by environmental noise.

To use the noise for communication in the way described above the fluctuations do not have to be

the above-described ones or other kinds of fundamental classical and quantum noises. If stationary

environmental noises dominate the channel and the sender can modulate the bandwidth, reflection or

some statistical property of the noise, zero-signal-power communication can be executed in the same

ways as described above. The properties will be similar but the noise will be bigger.

In this Letter, we outlined a new way of communication with zero signal power. The main advantage

of this method, as compared to other kinds of classical and quantum communication (quantum key

distribution), is that it is not only secure but it is stealth because only the usual background noise can

be detected in the channel.

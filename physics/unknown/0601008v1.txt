Abstract : Classical plane switching takes place in systems with a pronounced 1:2 resonance, 

where the degree of freedom with lowest frequency is doubly-degenerate. Under appropriate 

conditions, one observes a periodic and abrupt precession of the plane in which the doubly-

degenerate motion takes place. In this article, we show that quantum plane switching exists in 

CO2 : Based on our analytical solutions of the classical Hamilton's equations of motion, we 

describe  the  dependence  on  vibrational  angular  momentum  and  energy  of  the  frequency  of 

switches  and  the  plane  switching  angle.  Using  these  results,  we  find  optimal  initial  wave 

packet  conditions  for  CO2  and  show,  through  quantum  mechanical  propagation,  that  such  a 
wave packet indeed displays plane switching at energies around 10000 cm-1 above the ground 

state on time scales of about 100 fs.

1 - Introduction 

The resonant swing spring - a system which consists of a spring with one end fixed, a 

mass attached at the other end, and which is submitted to a constant vertical gravitation field - 

has  recently  received  much  attention  from  mathematicians  and  theoretical  physicists  [1-6]. 

When  the  physical  parameters  are  chosen  such  that  the  stretching  motion  and  the  doubly-

degenerate  swinging  motion  are  in  1:2  resonance,  the  swing  spring  has  some  remarkable 

features, including energy exchange, monodromy [3,5-8] and precession or switching of the 

swing plane [2-4]. By "precession of the swing plane" we mean the following. Suppose that 

the  system  is  initially  excited  almost  exclusively  in  the  stretch  degree  of  freedom.  One 

observes that the system periodically evolves into a planar swinging motion before returning 

back to its original springing motion. Most interestingly, the orientation of the swinging plane 

changes by a constant amount from one swinging phase to the next one, the size of the step 

depending on the initial conditions [2-4]. Under appropriate conditions, the orientation of the 

plane  remains  nearly  constant  for  a  time  of  several  pendular  oscillations  and  then  changes 

abruptly. Such behavior is called "plane switching". 

 

While  most  earlier  studies  investigated  the  properties  of  the  classical  swing  spring 

model, the aim of our present paper is to uncover this plane switching phenomenon in a real 

microscopic,  i.e.  quantum,  system  and  to  determine  whether  such  a  phenomenon  can  be 

observed  experimentally.  As  pointed  out  in  Ref.  [5],  the  CO2  molecule  is  a  nearly  perfect 

quantum analogue of the swing spring model. To analyze this real system, we should however 

take  into  account  the  detuning  from  the  exact  1:2  bend:stretch  Fermi  resonance, 

anharmonicities and/or other degrees of freedom (antisymmetric stretch, rotation), and the last 

but not the least, the quantum nature of this system. The standard method to tackle this latter 

aspect of the problem relies on the study of non-stationary quantum states, i.e. wave packets, 

 

 

 

2 

which in the limit of 

0→h

 evolve along the classical trajectories. More specifically, we are 

going to center a gaussian wave packet of minimal uncertainty  h  on the classical trajectory 

which exhibits the classical plane switching phenomenon. We want to find out whether and, 

especially,  under  which  conditions  this  wave  packet  is  capable  of  following  the  central 

trajectory for at least several steps and thus display quantum plane switching. 

 

As  in  Ref.  [5],  we  construct  and  use  an  integrable  approximation,  which  describes 

explicitly  only  the  three  relevant  vibrational  degrees  of  freedom  of  CO2,  namely,  the 

symmetric  stretch  (mode  1)  and  the  doubly-degenerate  bend  (mode  2).  We  verify  that  this 

Hamiltonian  is  valid  up  to  at  least  10000  cm-1  above  the  ground  state,  that  is,  14  quanta  of 

excitation  in  the  bend.  In  order  to  understand  the  dependence  of  the  phenomenon  on  the 

parameters  of  this  system,  the  vibrational  angular  momentum  L,  the  value  of  the  action 

integral I associated with the 1:2 polyad number, and the internal polyad energy, we solve the 

classical equations of motion for the 4th order Hamiltonian (Sect. 2). This solution relies on 

the early work [9,10] and extends Refs [2-4], where a 3rd order model without detuning was 

considered.  We  discuss  classical  plane  switching  in  Sect.  3.  Construction  of  optimal  wave 

packets begins in Sect. 4. The average total energy of the wave packet is roughly determined 

by P. We choose this energy to be as high as possible (within the validity of our Hamiltonian) 

to  maximize  the  density  of  states.  At  fixed  P,  the  obtained  expressions  for  the  classical 

frequencies of the system and the swinging plane precession angle are then used to conjecture 

in Sect. 4 what the optimal values of L and energy for the central trajectory are, in order for 

the plane switching phenomenon to show up as clearly as possible in the quantum mechanical 

system . By explicitly propagating the wave packet, we finally show in Sect. 5 that quantum 

CO2 indeed displays plane switching. 

While the main body of this article is hopefully of interest to the broad community of 

spectroscopists  and  chemists  -  and  has  consequently  been  written  using  adapted  vocabulary 

 

 

3 

and skipping a large part of the geometrical background - we feel that a number of aspects of 

Sect.  2-5  should  be  discussed  in  more  details,  in  order  to  make  this  article  also  more 

accessible  to  the  community  of  theoretical  physicists  and  mathematicians  and  to  relate  it  to 

preceding work in these fields. This more complete discussion is proposed in Appendix C. 

2 - Analytical resolution of Hamilton's equations 

The  Hamiltonian  of  the  integrable  approximation  used  in  Ref.  [5]  was  obtained  by 

applying 6th order Canonical Perturbation Theory [11] (CPT) to the potential energy surface 

of  Zuniga  et  al  [12].  Such  an  approximation  reproduces  experimental  data  to  within  a  few 

wave numbers up to more than 10000 cm-1 above the quantum mechanical ground state. In the 

present  study,  we  stopped  at  2nd  order  of  CPT  and  obtained  an  Hamiltonian  H,  which  is  a 

polynomial of degree 4 in dimensionless normal coordinates. Of course, the agreement with 

experimental  energies  is  consequently  less  quantitative,  but  the  dynamics  of  the  classical 

system  is  still  correctly  described  qualitatively  and,  most  importantly,  Hamilton's  equations 

can be solved analytically, while this is no longer possible at higher orders. On the other hand, 

numerical calculations in Sect. 4 and 5 can be performed with Hamiltonians of any order, but 

the differences with the results obtained using the 2nd order CPT Hamiltonian are  so slight 

that  we  chose,  for  the  sake  of  consistency,  to  present  only  these  later  ones  throughout  the 

paper.  Note  also  that  excitation  of  the  uncoupled  third  mode  of  CO2  (the  antisymmetric 

stretch) essentially shifts all quantities upwards by the corresponding amount of energy. The 

results  shown  below  were  obtained  by  freezing  this  degree  of  freedom  and  setting  the 

corresponding action integral to 1/2. The working Hamiltonian is thus written as

 are detailed in Appendix A. Note that, as shown in the 

same Appendix, this Hamiltonian is a higher-order analogue of the one in Eq. (29a) of Dullin 

et al [3]. It is also similar to the one in Eq. (4) of Ref. [6]. 

 

The system with Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.1) is integrable. To show this, we rewrite H in

with trivial linear relationships between the parameters of Eq. (2.1) and those of Eq. (2.3). It 

can be seen that Eq. (2.3) depends neither on the angle conjugate to I nor, of course, on that 

conjugate  to  L.  Therefore,  both  I  and  L  are  constants  of  the  motion  and  the  system  is 

integrable. 

 

Recall  that  we  want  to  describe  analytically  the  period  and  the  angle  of  the  plane 

switching  as  functions  of  dynamical  constants  L,  I  and  E.  To  that  end,  we  consider  the 

Hamiltonian  in  Eq.  (2.3)  as  the  Hamiltonian  of  the  one  degree  of  freedom  reduced  system 

with  conjugate  coordinates 

J φ
,(

)

.  We  note  that 

J =

  is  non-negative  and  bound  from 

12I

J

above by I. Therefore, J is a periodic function. In fact, J describes the energy in the stretch 

degree  of  freedom;  the  period  T  of 

)(tJ

  is  the  period  of  energy  transfer  between  the  two 

modes and, consequently, the period of plane switching. The position of the swinging plane is 

described by the angle conjugate to L in Eqs. (2.1) and (2.3), as has been demonstrated in Ref. 

[3]. It is emphasized that this angle, which is denoted by ρ in the rest of this article, is NOT 

the  polar  angle

.  The  expression  for  ρ  is  provided  in  Appendix  A.  Simple

calculations show that this definition is identical to the one in Eq. (54) of Ref. [3]. The angle

Hamilton's  equations  of  motions  are  solved  along  the  same  lines  as  in  Refs.  [9,10]. 

Using the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.3), we obtain the equation for

(2.5) 

Eq. (2.4) corresponds to Eq. (39) of Ref. [3]. Since we took first anharmonicities into account, 

the polynomial in the right-hand side of Eq. (2.4) is of degree 4 with respect to J, while it is of 

degree 3 in Ref. [3]. Moreover, Dullin et al consider only the case with no detuning (

0=ε

). 

To  simplify  the  choice  of  the  integration  constant,  we  suppose  in  Eq.  (2.6)  that  J  is  at 

maximum (

α=J

) at time 

0=t

It  is  important  to  realize  that  the

Therefore,  potential  problems  related  to  the  ill-definition  of

singularity  of  Eqs.  (2.12)-(2.14),  which  corresponds  to  the  unstable  relative  equilibrium 

discussed later in Sect. 3, are circumvented. Approximations for J,  *ω , ρ, and  ρ∆  can even

3 - Classical plane switching in CO2 

The  expressions  derived  in  Sect.  2  are  singular  at 

J =   and 
I

0=L

.  Since  these 

conditions  imply  that 

p

=

p

2

y

=

q

2

x

=

q

2

y

2

x

=

0

  and 

IEE =

,  the  singularity  takes  place 

when all energy is put in mode 1, that is, for CO2, in the symmetric stretch degree of freedom. 

In the original system, it corresponds to the unstable short periodic orbit, which is at the origin 

of  monodromy  and  plane  switching  [3,5].  The  singularity  corresponds  to  an  unstable 

equilibrium of the reduced one degree of freedom system with dynamical variables 

J φ
,(

)

 

J

and Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.3), where L and I are considered as parameters. Classically [2-4], 

plane  switching  manifests  itself  most  clearly  for  trajectories  approaching  closely  this  short 

periodic orbit, together with its stable and unstable manifolds, i.e. for trajectories with L close 

9 

to 0 and energy close to 

IE . In consequence, this section presents a qualitative description of 

what happens for such trajectories. 

 

When 

0=L

, the classical frequency  *ω  goes logarithmically to zero when the energy 

approaches  that  of  the  unstable  equilibrium  [10],  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  1,  which  displays  the 

variation of  *ω  as a function of energy E for a fixed value of I and several values of L. In 

contrast,  the  period  does  not  diverge  when 

0≠L

.  Furthermore,  variations  of 

*ω   become 

smoother and smoother with increasing values of  L . 

 

The angle of plane switching 

2−ρ∆

LT

 as function of E, I and L can be analyzed 

xLL

throughout the allowed energy range in a similar way, see Fig. 2. Since  ρ∆  is an odd function 

of L, 

xLL2−ρ∆

LT

 remains zero for 

0=L

. For 

0≠L

,  ρ∆  in Eq. (2.15) jumps by π at the 

two  specific  points  of  the  parameter  space  for  which 

.  As  we  said  above,  this  is 

=

LIEE
−

insignificant to our analysis because  ρ∆  is modulo π anyway, and it can be made artificially 

continuous by adding π to the value given by Eq. (2.15) in the case 

>

LIEE
−

. However, the 

discontinuity reflects the change of 

td/dρ

, which is positive when 

<

LIEE
−

 and negative 

when 

>

LIEE
−

.  As  in  the  case  of 

*ω ,  ρ∆   changes  rapidly  in  the  neighborhood  of 

=

LIEE
−

 for very small fixed values of  L , while its evolution with E becomes slower with 

increasing values of  L . 

 

The time evolution of ρ for different values of L and E (see Fig. 3 and compare to Fig. 

7  of  Ref.  [1]  and  Fig.  5  of  Ref.  [3])  can  be  understood  easily  on  the  basis  of  the  above 

considerations. If  L  is very small (top plot) and E very close to 

, then 

)(tρ

 looks like a 

LIE −

stair, with sharp transitions of amplitude 

2/π≈ρ∆

 connecting very long plateaux (T diverges 

at the relative equilibrium). According to Eqs. (2.10) and (2.12), the transitions occur when J 

 

10 

is  near  its  maximum  (

J

−≈α≈

I

L

),  that  is,  when  most  of  the  energy  is  localized  in  the 

symmetric  stretch  degree  of  freedom.  Each  plateau  corresponds  to  the  oscillations  of  the 

bending  motion  near  an  almost  fixed  direction  in  the 

(

q

,
x q

2

2

y

)

  plane,  while  the  sharp 

transition  between  two  successive  plateaux  represents  the  periodic  abrupt  change  of  this 

direction. It is precisely this behavior which is called plane switching [1-4]. 

 

If  L  is kept small while E departs from 

, the amplitude of the steps diminishes

rapidly,  while  T  is  simultaneously  reduced  (see  upper  plot  of  Fig.  3).  When  L   becomes 

larger (middle and bottom plots of Fig. 3), the length of the plateaux substantially decreases, 

but 

)(tρ

 evolves less markedly with energy. For example, it is seen that for 

2=L

 and 

6=L

 

the two curves at 

=

− LIEE

1.0+

 cm-1 and 

=

− LIEE

40+

 cm-1 look like stairs of amplitude 

2/π≈ρ∆

 and are almost superimposed. Whatever the value of L, the stair-like character of 

)(tρ

 disappears when energy deviates too much from 

LIE −

. 

 

It  should  also  be  emphasized  that,  like  for  the  swing  spring,  the  bending  motion 

appears to be "linear" only for very small  L . Rigorously speaking, this motion traces ellipses 

in  the 

(

q

x q
,

2

2

y

)

  plane  [3].  When  L   is  larger,  the  eccentricity  of  the  ellipses  becomes 

smaller,  so  that  the  bending  motion  can  hardly  be  described  as  taking  place  along  a  line. 

Consider, for example, the 

(

q

)

 plane projections of trajectories with 

5.13=I

, L=0.1, 

x q
,

2

2

y

2  and  6,  and 

=

  cm-1  shown  in  Fig.  4.  One  is  tempted  to  conclude,  somewhat 

subjectively,  that  plane-switching,  that  is,  motion  along  a  line  which  precesses  by  jumps, 

takes place for 

1.0=L

 and 

2=L

 (and thus for any L in the interval), but not for 

6=L

. 

4 - Determination of optimal initial conditions for the plane switching wave packet 

 

 

 

11 

 

One of the principal objectives of this work is to determine the best initial conditions 

for a quantum wave packet to display plane switching. First we chose the total action I for the 

centre of the packet in order to have a sufficiently large density of states while remaining in 

the  validity  domain  of  our  Hamiltonian.  According  to  this  criterion,  values  around  I=14 

(corresponding  to  energies  near  10000  cm-1  above  the  quantum  mechanical  ground  state) 

appear reasonable. Indeed, we have seen in Ref. [5] that the related phenomenon of quantum 

monodromy can be well observed in this region. 

 

It remains to determine the values of E and L. Recall from the previous section that the 

plane switching phenomenon is most clearly seen for trajectories launched in the vicinity of 

the singularity at 

J =  and 
I

0=L

. Consequently, we are tempted to center our wave packets 

on  such  trajectories.  At  the  same  time, 

*ω   and  ρ∆   depend  very  sharply  on  the  initial 

conditions in this region. Therefore, wave packets launched too close to the unstable relative 

equilibrium will disperse very rapidly, i.e. in a time less than T. If such rapid dispersion takes 

place, quantum plane switching cannot be observed. In other words, the rate of change of  *ω  

and  ρ∆   should  not  become  too  large  on  the  scale  of  h   (

1=h

  in  the  units  of  this  paper). 

Examination of Fig. 3 suggests that the solution might consist in centering the wave packet at 

somewhat larger values of L and the corresponding energy 

LIE − . The good compromise for 

CO2 in the 10000 cm-1 energy range therefore appears to be a wave packet centered around 

2=L

 and 

=

LIEE
−

. 

 

We  checked  the  validity  of  this  conjecture  by  launching  swarms  of  10000  classical 

trajectories  with  a  gaussian  distribution  of  width 

p
∆

q
∆=

  along  each  degree  of 

j

1=
2

j

freedom (j=1, 2x and 2y). We propagated the trajectories numerically using the Hamiltonian 

expressed in dimensionless normal coordinates (Eqs. (2.1) and (A.4) in Sect. 2 and Appendix 

A). As expected, we found that a swarm centered on a trajectory with 

5.13=I

, 

1.0=L

 and 

 

12 

=

LIEE
−

,  dispersed  so  rapidly,  that  the  trajectories  were  almost  uniformly  spread  over  all 

the accessible phase space in times shorter than the period T of the central trajectory. No plane 

switching was observed. The result for a distribution centered on a trajectory with 

5.13=I

, 

2=L

  and 

=

LIEE
−

,  which  is  shown  in  Fig.  5,  is  qualitatively  different.  Each  vignette  of  

this figure shows the projection of the trajectories on the 

(

q

)

 plane at given increasing 

,
x q

2

2

y

times t indicated in the upper left corner (in fs). The position of the trajectory, around which 

the  distribution  was  centered  at 

0=t

,  is  indicated  by  a  large  empty  circle.  The  first  three 

vignettes (t=2, 26 and 50 fs) correspond to the first round trip along the initial direction of the 

bending motion. One observes little dispersion during this phase, because it corresponds to the 

plateau of 

)(tρ

 for most trajectories. Then, plane switching occurs near t=50 fs, and the last 

five vignettes (t=66, 90, 102, 114 and 126 fs) correspond to one round trip along a direction 

almost exactly perpendicular to the initial one. Dispersion is much more important during this 

second phase, because, as discussed above, the plane switching amplitude and the exact time 

where the step occurs are different for each trajectory. Dispersion in 

(

q

x q
,

2

2

y

)

 is maximum 

at  the  "turning  points"  of  the  bending  motion  (i.e.  the  extremities  of  the  narrow  ellipses). 

Nonetheless, one clearly observes that the density of trajectories near the "central" trajectory 

is  at  all  times  significantly  larger  than  elsewhere.  Moreover,  both  the  time  required  for  the 

first  plane  switch  and  the  switch  angle  correspond  well  to  those  of  the  "central"  trajectory. 

This confirms that 

2=L

 and 

=

LIEE
−

 are likely to be suitable initial conditions to observe 

quantum plane switching in CO2. 

5 - Quantum mechanical plane switching in CO2

To investigate quantum plane switching in CO2, we considered a minimum uncertainty 

wave  packet  centered  at  time 

0=t

  on  the  same  classical  trajectory  as  in  Sect.  4.  We  then 

computed its time evolution quantum mechanically. More precisely, the wave packet at time

The computed probability density is shown in Fig. 6 for the same time sequence as in Fig. 5. 

Apart from the sharper localization of the quantum wave packet at certain times (especially at 

t=50,  102  and  126  fs),  the  agreement  between  classical  and  quantum  mechanical  results  is 

striking. Thus we can conclude that the density of states is sufficiently high and we are close 

to  the  semiclassical  limit.  Most  importantly,  the  propagation  of  the  quantum  wave  packet 

displays clearly the abrupt change of the orientation of the swinging plane. 

6 - Conclusion 

In  this  work,  we  demonstrated  that  quantum  plane  switching  exists  in  CO2.  This 

quantum  system  displays,  under  appropriate  conditions,  a  periodic  and  abrupt  precession  of 

the plane in which the doubly-degenerate bending motion takes place. Based on our analytical 

solutions of the classical equations of motion for the 4th order Hamiltonian, we described the 

dependence of the frequency of switches  *ω  and the plane switching angle  ρ∆  on vibrational 

angular  momentum  and  energy.  Using  these  results,  we  found  optimal  initial  wave  packet 

conditions  and  showed,  through  quantum  mechanical  propagation,  that  such  a  wave  packet 

indeed displays plane switching at energies around 10000 cm-1 above the ground state on time 

scales  of  about  100  fs.  This  provides  concrete  motivation  and  vital  information  for  further 

analysis of the possibility of experimental observation of plane switching in this system.

In this Appendix, we give relations between various sets of dynamical variables used 

here  and  in  related  work  [3,5,6]  to  describe  a  two-dimensional  harmonic  oscillator  in 

resonance  1:1  and  its  perturbations.  In  CO2  these  variables  represent  bending  vibrations 

(mode 2), in the swing-spring they describe pendular oscillations. We then comment on our 

treatment of the whole system with three degrees of freedom and compare it to Refs. [3,5,6]. 

Before we begin, we like to draw attention to the difference in designating resonance 

systems  that  can  cause  some  confusion.  Near  an  equilibrium,  the  usual  definition  of  the 

resonance condition is given in mechanics (see for example Appendix (7.A) in Ref. [15]) in 

terms  of  the  ratio  of  frequencies  of  the  linear  approximation  (i.e.,  harmonic  frequencies) 

corresponding  to  each  degree  of  freedom.  It  is  customary  to  sort  frequencies  in  ascending 

order. According to such definition, the system of symmetric stretch vibration (mode 1) and 

bending  vibration  (degenerated  mode  2)  of  CO2  has  frequency  ratio 

ωωω
1

:

:

  which  is 

almost exactly 1:1:2 times a common factor. Such plain notation is used in Refs. [3,5,6] and 

in this Appendix. On the other hand, the traditional molecular notation is 1:2. To complicate 

matters,  many  researchers  (including  Fermi  itself)  focused  exclusively  on  the 

0=L

  case, 

which is equivalent to the planar swing-spring system with two degrees of freedom and is also 

designated  1:2.  Furthermore,  molecular  physicists  sometimes  require  the  presence  of 

nonlinear  coupling  terms  in  order  to  qualify  the  system  as  resonant:  for  example  they 

distinguish 1:1 and 2:2 systems. Since the axial symmetry forbids direct coupling of the two 

components of the bending vibration in CO2, they argue in favor of the 1:2 notation which we 

used in the main body of the paper.

The  major  disadvantage  of  this  very  traditional  approach  is  that  the  singularity  of  polar 

coordinates at

 distorts the geometry of the system. In fact, the true topology of 

the reduced phase space obtained after reduction of the axial symmetry SO(2) is not that of R2 

but  that  of  a  cone  with  vertex  at 

q

.  Polar  coordinates  are  inconvenient  in  the

analysis of monodromy and plane switching because in these studies we are interested in the 

dynamics near the hyperbolic equilibrium

 [3,8,17]. In this paper, we do not use

polar  coordinates  except  for  some  intermediate  results  and  for  representation  of  quantum 

wave functions (which is yet another well established tradition). 

C.1.3 - Action-angle coordinates 

There  are  two  varieties  of  action-angle  variables  for  the  two-oscillator  in  1:1 

resonance. One is simple one-dimensional oscillator action variables  kI

 and conjugate angles

The angle ρ plays the central role in the description of plane switching because it gives the 

instantaneous position of the plane (or more precisely, of the major axis of the ellipse which 

the trajectory traces in the

 plane) [3]. Notice that in Ref. [3] this angle is denoted as θ. 

C.1.4 - Angular momentum analogy for the 1:1 oscillator system 

In  physical  applications,  the  S1  dynamical  symmetry  of  the  1:1  resonance  is  often 

approximate  and  the  original  Hamiltonian  should  be  first  normalized.  If  the  original  system 

has other degrees of freedom which are not in resonance, they can be averaged out at the same 

time. The resulting normal form Hamiltonian H describes such other degrees effectively and 

is  S1  symmetric,  i.e., 

0H   becomes  a  constant  of  motion  and  {

} 0
0 =HH

,

.  In  practical 

interpretations  of  experimental  data  one  often  skips  normalization  and 

introduces 

 

 

 

 

21 

phenomenological  model  systems  with  exact  S1  symmetry  and  with  model  effective 

Hamiltonians whose parameters are adjusted to reproduce the data. In molecules, vibrational 

states  with  the  same 

0H   are  often  called  polyads,  hence  the  terminology  "polyad 

Hamiltonian",  "polyad  quantum  number",  etc.  Instructive  examples  of  such  polyads  can  be 

found in the literature on the triatomic molecules O3 and 

+
3H . 

 

To  represent  H,  we  notice  that  the  ring  of  all  invariants  of  the  S1  action  of  the 

dynamical  symmetry  of  the  1:1  oscillator  system  is  generated  multiplicatively  by  four 

quadratic invariants of the general form 

. They can be chosen as

The widely used analog of this construction in quantum mechanics is the boson representation 

of angular momentum operators which is introduced by Schwinger [18] and which is based on 

the isomorphism of the algebras su(2) and so(3). 

 

It  can  be  seen  that  (as  any  S1  invariant)  the  classical  polyad  Hamiltonian  H  is  a 

function  of 

(

,

j
1

,

j

2

j

3

)

  and  j.  Since  j  is  a  constant  of  motion,  we  fix  j  and  consider  it  as  a 

dynamical  parameter  thus  reducing  the  original  1:1  oscillator  system  to  one  degree  of 

freedom.  The  reduced  Hamiltonian 

(
jH j
1

,

,

j

2

j

3

)

  is  defined  on  the  reduced  (or  polyad) 

phase space 

jP . From Eq. (C.4) we see that for any 

0>j

 this space is a sphere S2 and indeed 

 

22 

it  often  is  called  "polyad  sphere".  At  this  point  we  can  appreciate  the  advantage  over  any 

approach  with  one  fixed  system  of  canonical  coordinates  as  any  such  system  for  S2  would 

have singularities! In fact, to work on S2 we should use (at least) two symplectic charts - or 

run  into  trouble.  Thus  in  the  presence  of  axial  symmetry  (which  acts  on 

(

,

j
1

,

j

2

j

)

  as 

rotation about axis  2j ), one is often tempted to use 

L =

, known as "vibrational" angular 

momentum, and the corresponding conjugate angle

which follows for the 3-vector

 and is, of course, the same as in Sec. C.1.3. It 

can be seen that coordinates

of  S2  with  obvious  problems  at  the  poles

.  Consequently, 

LL φ

  should  be  used 

with appropriate caution. 

 

Finally  notice  that  canonical  polyad  coordinates  are  simply  unnecessary.  Their 

purpose in typical polyad studies seems to be the derivation of Hamilton equations of motion 

for 

the 

reduced  system.  However, 

for  any  given  classical  polyad  Hamiltonian

C.2 - Reduced CO2 Hamiltonian and reduced phase space 

The  plane  switching  phenomenon  in  CO2  and  the  swing-spring  is  studied  after 

reducing  the  original  system  with  three  degrees  of  freedom  both  with  respect  to  the  axial 

symmetry  SO(2)  of  rotations  of  plane

which represents a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator with frequencies in 1:1:2 resonance. 

The  original  CO2  Hamiltonian  is,  of  course,  not  strictly  S1  invariant.  It  is  made  so  by 

normalization  (the  particular  method  used  in  Ref.  [5]  and  in  this  work  is  CPT  [11])  and 

truncation at the desired order. 

C.2.1 - Geometry of singular reduction 

The  truncated  normal  form  H  in  Eq.  (2.3)  Poisson  commutes  both  with  I  and  (since 

normalization preserves the axial symmetry) with L. In other words, I and L are first integrals 

of  the  system  with  Hamiltonian  H.  Reduction  of  the  respective  degrees  of  freedom  means 

reduction of the combined action of the dynamical 1:1:2 symmetry S1 and the axial symmetry 

SO(2).  As  a  result  we  obtain  a  system  with  one  degree  of  freedom  and  two-dimensional 

reduced  phase  space 

.  There  is  a  one-to-one  correspondence  between  points  of  spaces 

LIP ,

LIP ,

 and orbits of the S1× SO(2) action.

As  we  show  later  in  Sec.  C.2.3,  the  space 

  does  not  always  have  the  same

topology  :  for 

L =   it  is  just  a  point,  it  is  diffeomorphic  to  a  sphere  S2  for  all

I

0,IP   is  a  singular  sphere  with  one  conical  point  for 

maximum 

J =   (see  Fig.  7,  left).  The  geometric  reason  for  the  singularity  of 

I

0,IP   is 

fundamental. The 1:1:2 action S1 on the original phase space 

 of the Fermi system is not

because

 are, obviously, two times shorter than all others (for CO2 

these are trajectories of the symmetric stretch normal mode 1). The SO(2) action is not free 

either  because  points  in 

*σ   (and  only  these  points)  are  its  fixed  points.  It  follows  that  for 

fixed 

0>I

  and 

0=L

,  the  combined  S1× SO(2)  action  has  one  nonregular  circular  orbit 

1
σ⊂IS

*

  with 

J = ,  while  all  other  orbits  are  regular  2-tori.  Reduction  of  the  S1× SO(2) 

I

symmetry sends these orbits to points of the reduced spaces 

. Every point of 

LIP ,

LIP ,

 with 

0≠L

  represents  a  particular  regular 

2T   orbit,  while 

0,IP   has  one  isolated  point  which 

represents the singular circle. Such point on 

0,IP  must necessarily be singular. The situation 

described  above  is  characteristic  of  reduction  of  non-free  symmetry  actions  or  singular 

reduction  pioneered  by  Cushman  [8,17]  as  a  generalization  of  regular  reduction  of  Lie 

symmetries  [19].  Singular  reduction  is  particularly  common  in  applications  such  as  systems 

with resonances other than 1:...:1. 

C.2.2 - Reduction using action-angle variables

, such that 

L ≤  and 
I

J

  where 

Jφ

Jφ   is 

conjugate  to  J  (see  Eq.  (2.2)).  Replacing  I  and  L  for  their  values,  we  obtain  the  reduced 

Hamiltonian 

H

Coordinates

 are "polar coordinates in disguise" [17]: as illustrated in Fig. 7,

they  give  a  cylindrical  chart

  of  the  actual  reduced  phase  space 

LIP ,

. 

The situation is similar to that discussed in Sec. C.1.4 albeit now 

 has not always the  2S  

LIP ,

topology  and  can  itself  be  singular.  Worst  of  all,  the  singularity  of 

0,IP   is  masked  by  the 

singularity  of  the  chart 

LIP
,

P→

,
LI

  and  it  remained  for  this  reason  unrecognized  in  a 

number of studies of the polyads of the 1:2 Fermi systems. 

 

One might argue that coordinates 

J φ
,(

)

 are inappropriate for studying monodromy 

J

and  plane  switching  in  our  system  because  in  such  study  we  are  interested  in  the  dynamics 

near the "combined" singularity of these coordinates at 

J =  and the underlying phase space 

I

0,IP   and  should  have  discontinuities  in  the  solution  for 

)(tJφ

.  However,  following  the 

derivation of Eqs. (2.4) and (2.10), one realizes that 

 is of no value to our analysis and 

)(tJφ

that  we  have  circumvented  this  difficulty  by  excluding 

  completely  from  our 

)(tJφ

consideration. In particular Eq. (2.10) is obtained by combining 

d/d
t
ρ

 and 

EH =

 

in order to eliminate the Fermi term with 

cos(

)

. 

 

 

 

 

C.2.3 - Poisson reduction 

We  now  briefly  survey  the  way  to  reduce  the  symmetries  of  the  1:1:2  system  while 

preserving  its  geometry  [3,5,6]  in  order  to  show  that  our  Eqs.  (2.4)  and  (2.10)  are  indeed 

direct higher order analogs of the ones studied previously for the resonant swing-spring [3]. 

The reduced system can be described fully using three dynamical variables

account, we can show that the reduced Hamiltonian

two  invariants  R  and  S  and  that  it  includes  only  even  degrees  in  L.  The  trio  of  functions

of Jacobi elliptic function sn(t) and is used in this paper. This solution is a rational function of

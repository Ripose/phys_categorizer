Abstract.  Tapping  mode  atomic  force  microscopy  is  a  standard  technique  for  inspection  and 
analysis at the nanometer scale. The understanding of the non-linear dynamics of the system due 
to the tip sample interaction is an important prerequisite for a correct interpretation data acquired 
by dynamic AFM. Here, the system response in tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM) 
simulated  numerically.  In  the  computer  model  the  AFM  microcantilever  is  treated  as  a 
distributed  parameter  system.  With  this  multiple-degree-of-freedom  (MDOF)  approach  the  the 
total harmonic distortion in dynamic AFM spectroscopy is simulated.   

INTRODUCTION 

The  atomic-force  microscopy  (AFM)  has  become  an  standard  inspection  and 
analysis  tool  in  research  as  well  as  in  industry.  The  tapping  or  intermittent  contact 
mode is presently the most widely used imaging modes in practical AFM applications. 
In  this  mode  of  operation,  the  forced  oscillation  amplitude  of  the  force  sensor  is 
adjusted  to  a  value  between  10  nm  and  100  nm.  During  imaging  the  amplitude  is 
limited by the specimen surface which can be understood as a non-linear mechanical 
controller  limiting  the  amplitude.  Thus,  a  theoretical  description  of  the  system 
dynamics  in  this  mode  requires  an  understanding  of  the  non-linear  system  dynamics 
[1].  The  non-linear  tip-sample  interaction  leads  to  a  complicated  system  behavior.  It 
was shown that the system is well behaved for a large set of parameters but that it also 
can  exhibit  a  complex  dynamics  [2-4].  The  non-linearity  also  induces  higher 
harmonics in the system response which are amplified by the higher eigenmodes of the 
force sensor [5-8].  

These higher harmonics can be measured by dynamic force spectroscopy recording 
the  full  spectral  response  of  the  system.  This  also  allows  one  to  directly  measure 
transient tip-sample interaction forces by signal inversion [9]. In a simplified analysis 
the individual higher harmonics characterize the system dynamics [10].  

The total harmonic distortion is a measure for the degree of the generation of higher 
harmonics.  In  the  following,  the  response  of  the  total  harmonic  distortion  to  the 
variation  of  average  tip-sample  gap  is  investigated  by  numerical  simulations.  To 
model the higher eigenmodes of the cantilever a 6-th-order state space model is used.

MODELLING 

The  microcantilever  in  atomic-force  microscopy  is  approximated  by  a  linear  and 
time invariant (LTI) system. In tapping mode, its deflection is typically of the order of 
a  few  nanometers,  whereas  its  thickness  is  in  the  range  of  microns.  Therefore,  the 
cantilever [Fig. 1 (a)] is modelled as a LTI system with a non-linear output feedback 
[Fig. 1 (b)]. To investigate the basic phenomena in the following, only forces that act 
onto the tip at input (1) will be considered..

TOTAL HARMONIC DISTORTION 

In  order  to  compute  the  system  response  in  a  dynamic  AFM  spectroscopy 
sz  was reduced by ramping. At each approach step the 
experiment the sample position 
ramp was halted and the system was allowed to equilibrate for more than 1000 cycles

amplitude  and  phase  of  the  first  harmonic  (fundamental)  together  with  the  total 
harmonic  distortion  of  the  position  output  (1)  and  the  average  force.  The  harmonic

CONCLUSIONS 

In comparison with experimental data obtained earlier [10] the characteristics of the 
response of the simulated  THD  are similar to that of the experimental data in Fig. 3 
although the scaling is different. The increase in the  THD  at the transition from the 
attractive  to  the  repulsive  state  (arrow)  was  also  observed  in  the  experimental  data. 
Additionally, both maxima in Fig. 3 of the  THD  (arrows) are well reproduced by the 
numerical  simulations.  This  indicates  that  the  numerical  simulations  capture  basic 
features of the dynamics in tapping mode AFM. In order to achieve a better match of 
the  numerical  simulations  to  the  experimental  data  a  more  precise  modelling  is 
necessary.  This  includes  a  better  mathematical  model  for  the  cantilever  as  it  can  be 
obtained  e.g.  by  system  identification  and  an  more  precise  model  of  the  contact 
mechanics.

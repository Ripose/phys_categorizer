We  report  on  the  phenomenon  of  controllable  soliton  dragging  by  dynamical  optical 

lattices  induced  by  three  imbalanced  interfering  plane  waves.  Because  of  such  an 

imbalance,  the  transverse  momentum  of  the  lattice  does  not  vanish,  and  thus  the 

dynamical lattice can cause soliton dragging. The dragging rate is shown to depend on 

the amplitude and on the angle of incidence of the third plane wave making the optical 

lattice.

The  periodic  modulation  of  the  linear  refractive  index  of  a  medium  can 

drastically  affect  the  diffraction  properties  of  light  beams.  This  effect  acting  in 

conjunction with nonlinear processes can lead to a specific class of optical solitons – the 

so-called discrete solitons whose mobility in the transverse direction depends strongly on 

their  power  level.1,2  Arrays  of  evanescently  coupled  waveguides  are  prime  examples  of 

such  systems  where  discrete  solitons  can  be  directly  observed  and  investigated.  The 

potential  of  these  self-localized  states  toward  practical  applications  such  as  all-optical 

soliton steering and switching has also been addressed in several studies.3-8 

Quite  recently  the  possibility  of  creating  reconfigurable  index  profiles  has  been 

demonstrated in biased photorefractive crystals. In these latter systems, optical lattices 

(harmonic  refractive  index  modulations)  with  adjustable  depth  and  period  have  been 

optically induced.9-11 It is important to note, that so far, all the lattices considered in the 

 

 

 

 

1

literature  (see  for  example  Refs.  [9-11]),  are  by  nature  invariant  along  the  direction  of 

propagation  (longitudinal  direction).  This  is  because these arrays are established using 

non-diffracting  interference  patterns  that  are  polarized  in  a  direction  in  which  the 

crystal  behaves  in  a  quasi-linear  fashion.  On  the  other  hand,  the  polarization  of  the 

discrete soliton beam is such that it feels not only the periodic potential introduced by 

the lattice forming beam but also the nonlinearity of the biased photorefractive crystal.9-

10  The  possibility  of  soliton  steering  and  switching  in  optical  lattices  has  also  been 

analyzed in Refs. [12,13]. 

In this Letter we investigate the behavior of discrete solitons in dynamic optical 

lattices  that  exhibit  a  finite  momentum  in  the  transverse  plane.  Such  lattices  can  be 

readily synthesized as long as the sum of the transverse wavevectors of the interfering 

beams  (that  optically  induce  the  lattice)  is  not  zero.  In  this  case  we  show  that 

transverse  momentum  can  be  transferred  from  the  lattice  to  the  discrete  soliton  beam 

thus  leading  to  a  controllable  drift.  This  effect is examined in detail in an imbalanced 

three-wave lattice interaction where it is shown that the rate of the soliton drift depends 

on the amplitude and the propagation angle of the third weak plane wave. 

Let  us  consider  the  propagation  of  a  slit  (planar)  laser  beam  along  the 

longitudinal 

ξ

  axis  in  a  biased  photorefractive  crystal.  A  periodic  index  modulation  is 

also optically induced in the crystal’s transverse 

η

 direction. The soliton beam and the 

interfering lattice-creating plane waves are orthogonally polarized to each other so that 

the  nonlinearity  affects  only  the  soliton  beam.

that  the  third  beam  is  weak,  e.g.  b

α =

and 

β

. As one can clearly see, the two waves with angles  ±  create a static harmonic 

α

lattice  whose  profile  is  invariant  with 

ξ

,  while  the  weak  third  wave  component  that 

propagates  at  an  angle 

β

  makes  the  lattice  imbalanced,  so  that  it  carries  a  net 

momentum.  The  index  profile  of  the  dynamical  lattice  arising  from  the  interference  of 

these 

three 

waves

.  The  structure  of  this 

lattice is shown in Fig. 1. The lattice modulation depth and spatial frequency (along

grow  as  the  amplitude  b   and  angle

  of  the  third  plane  wave  increase.  In  addition, 

equation (1) allows the total power or energy flow

When 

b =   the  nonlinear  lattice  is  stationary  (has  zero  momentum)  and 

0

supports soliton solutions that conserve their profiles upon propagation along the lattice 

channels.  The  discrete  soliton  solution  can  be  obtained  by  assuming  the  form 

q

, where w

( )η

 is a real function and λ  is a propagation constant. A 

detailed  study  of  the  soliton  properties  in  photorefractive  stationary  lattices  can  be 

found  in  Refs.  [9-11].  Here  we  only  recall  the  fact  that  there  exist  an  upper  λ

and a lower  λ

 cutoff for the soliton existence, where the lower cutoff  λ

low

 

E

upp =
 is defined 

low

solely by the amplitude  a  and the angles  ±  of the lattice-creating plane waves (Fig. 

α

2).  Close  to  their  cutoffs  the  lattice  solitons  broaden  drastically  and  cover  many 

transverse  lattice  periods.  The  energy  flow  is  a  monotonically  growing  function  of  the 

propagation  constant.  Further  we  interested  in  the  propagation  of  relatively  broad 

solitons  with  energy  flow U

  in  dynamical  lattices  with  b

0≠

.  The  width  of  such 

solitons decreases with increase of U . Such solitons (found by solving Eq. (1) at b

0

) 

experience  almost  no  change  in  their  shape  when  they  are  launched  parallel  to  the  ξ  

axis (into the distorted lattice) as long as b

. However the soliton center

experiences a progressive shift in the  η  coordinate along the propagation direction of the 

third plane wave, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Even though the trajectory of the soliton center 

(2)

is rather complicated, it is clear from Fig. 2(c) that the accumulated transverse shift is 

proportional  to  the  propagation  distance,  and  hence  it  is  possible  to  introduce  an 

average soliton drift angle as  φ

/η=

. In what follows we will show that the soliton 

drift angle can be controlled by the amplitude b  and the angle 

β

 of third plane wave. 

To  understand  the  physical  origin  of  soliton  dragging  induced  by  the  dynamical 

optical lattices one can consider a simplified nearly-integrable version of Eq. (1) that can 

be obtained under the assumptions

If under appropriate conditions the last term in Eq. (3) can be considered small, then it 

is  possible  to  use  perturbation  theory  (based  on  the  inverse  scattering  transform)  in 

order to analyze the evolution parameters of the soliton solutions of the unperturbed Eq.

adequately describes soliton profile in the dynamical lattice. Equation (5) clearly shows 

that it is the last “interference” term in the expression in the lattice profile  R

( , )η ξ

 that 

leads  to  the  soliton  drift  along  the  positive  η   direction.  According  to  Eq.  (5)  the 

propagation  angle  φ   oscillates  periodically  between  zero  and  its  maximum  value,  and 

this  explains  why  the  soliton  center  oscillates  as  shown  in  Fig.  2(c).  The  average  drift 

angle  with  respect  to  the 

ξ

  axis  can  be  obtained  from  Eq.  (5)  by  omitting  the  term 

cos[(

β

2

−

2
α ξ

) / 2]

  that  oscillates  upon  propagation.  According  to  Eq.  (5)  the  average 

drift  angle  grows  linearly  with  the  amplitudes  a b   of  the  lattice-creating  plane  waves, 

,

and  monotonically  increases  with  the  soliton  amplitude 

χ

  (or,  equivalently,  its  energy 

flow).  Finally  it  decreases  as  the  difference 

β α−

  between  plane  wave  propagation 

angles increases. This is because the momentum exchange becomes less effective as the 

lattice “breaths” faster during propagation. 

 

We have verified the predictions obtained on the basis of the reduced model Eq. 

(3) with direct numerical simulations of Eq. (1) that describes optical beam propagation 

in actual photorefractive crystals such as SBN.9,10 The dimensionless parameters that we 

use  below  correspond  to  an  input  beam  with  width  ∼

10 mµ

  at  the  wavelength

 and biased with a static electric field  ∼

610 V/m

. For input, we 

have  used  the  exact  soliton  solutions  of  Eq.  (1)  when  the  third  plane  wave  is  zero 

b =
(

0)

. By doing so, both the soliton center trajectory as well as the average drift angle 

was  monitored.  These  results  are  summarized  in  Fig.  3  and  are  in  full  agreement  with 

the  theoretical  predictions.  One  can  see  from  Fig.  3(a)  that  the  soliton  drift  angle 

decreases  monotonically  as  the  difference  β

α−

  increases.  This  should  have  been 

anticipated since the soliton does not “feel” the rapid oscillations of the dynamic lattice 

when 

β α−

 is large. Notice that at 

β

α=

 the lattice becomes stationary, thus unable 

to drag the solitons. Consequently the soliton drift angle drops off as 

β

α→

; this occurs 

in  the  region  of  very  small  angle  differences  β

α−

,  not  even  visible  in  Fig.  3(a).  The 

soliton  propagation  trajectory  may  depart  considerably  from  the  trajectory  of  a  linear 

beam for such small angle differences. 

It  is  worth  noticing  that  the  dragging  effect  of  dynamical  lattice  is  more 

pronounced  for  narrow  solitons  that  have  higher  energy  flows  (Fig.  3(b)).  This  effect, 

 

5

that may be surprising at a first glance, is fully consistent with properties of solitons in 

lattices.1-8 Narrow solitons experience stronger interactions with stationary lattices, hence 

their  mobility  is  restricted.  However,  in  our  case  it  is  the  dynamical  lattice  that  drags 

the  otherwise  immobile  solitons;  therefore  stronger  interactions  experienced  by  narrow 

solitons result in more effective momentum exchange, hence in more effective dragging. 

Finally,  as  expected,  the  drift  angle  varies  linearly  with  b  (Fig.  3(c)).  Notice  that  the 

trajectory of the soliton center can depart considerably from a linear one also for narrow 

solitons  occupying  only  a  couple  of  lattice  sites  and  in  strongly  distorted  lattices  with 

b

a∼

,  β α

− ∼ α

,β

. 

 

In conclusion, we have predicted that lattice solitons can experience a progressive 

drift in imbalanced optical lattices that exhibit transverse momentum. The soliton drift 

is  caused  by  the  dragging  induced  by  the  dynamically-evolving  lattice.  The  drift  angle 

can be effectively controlled by varying the amplitude and the angle of a weak control 

plane  wave.  The  effect  reported  here  may  have  promising  applications  in  all-optical 

steering applications.

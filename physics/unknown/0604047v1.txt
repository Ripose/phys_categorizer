Abstract

Parity nonconservation in b

 decay processes is considered to be a  fundamental property

of  weak  interactions.  Nevertheless,  this  property can  be  treated  as  an  anomaly,  because  in  the

rest  types  of the  fundamental  interactions  parity  is  conserved.  Analogously,  anomaly  in  short-

duration strong-current pulse discharges is well known. The essence of this phenomenon consists

in  generation  of  local  high-temperature  plasma  formations  with  typical  values  of  its

thermodynamic parameters exceeding those related to the central section of a discharge. In this

paper,  an  attempt  is  undertaken  to  treat  these  anomalies  as  manifestations  of  the  fundamental
properties of gravitational emission.  Some  consequences of this assumption can be tested  in b

decay experiments as well as in experiments with short-duration z-pinch-type pulse discharges.

1.  Gravitational  emission  of  electrons  with  a  banded  spectrum  as  emission  of  the

same level with electromagnetic emission.

 

For  a  mathematical  model of interest,  which describes  a  banded  spectrum of  stationary

states  of  electrons  in  the  proper  gravitational  field,  two  aspects  are  of  importance.  First.  In
Einstein's field equations k

 is a constant which relates the space-time geometrical properties with

the distribution of physical matter, so that the origin of the equations is not  connected with the
numerical  limitation  of  the k
Classical Theory of Gravity leads to the small value k

  value.  Only  the  requirement  of  conformity  with  the  Newtonian
 = 8p G/c4, where G, c are, respectively, the

Newtonian  gravitational  constant  and the  velocity of light.  Such requirement  follows  from the

primary  concept  of  the  Einstein  General  Theory  of  Relativity (GTR) as  a  relativistic

generalization  of  the  Newtonian  Theory  of  Gravity.  Second.  The  most  general  form  of
relativistic gravitation equations are equations with the L

 term. The limiting transition to  weak

fields leads to the equation

= - 4p

r G +L c2,

where F

  is  the  field  scalar  potential, r

  is  the  source  density.  This  circumstance,  eventually,  is

crucial  for  neglecting  the L

  term,  because  only in this  case  the  GTR  is  a  generalization of the

Classical  Theory of  Gravity.  Therefore,  the  numerical  values  of k

  =  8p G/c4 and L

  =  0  in  the

GTR  equations  are  not  associated  with  the  origin  of  the  equations,  but  follow  only  from  the

conformity of the GTR with the classical theory.

 

 

 

From the 70's onwards,  it  became obvious [1] that in the quantum region the numerical

value of G  is not  compatible with the principles  of quantum mechanics.  In a number  of papers
[1]  (including [2]) it was shown that in the quantum region the coupling constant K (K » 1040 G)

is acceptable.  The  essence  of the  problem of the  generalization of relativistic  equations on the

quantum  level  was  thus  outlined:  such  generalization  must  match  the  numerical  values  of the

gravity constants in the quantum and classical regions.

In  the  development  of  these  results,  as  a  micro-level  approximation  of  Einstein's  field

equations, a model is proposed, based on the following assumption:

           The gravitational field within the region of localization of an elementary particle having a
mass m0 is characterized by the values of the gravity constant K and of the constant L

 that lead

to the stationary states of the particle in its proper gravitational field, and the particle stationary

states as such are the sources of the gravitational field with the Newtonian gravity constant G.

The  most  general  approach  in  the  Gravity  Theory  is  the  one  which  takes  twisting  into

account  and  treats  the  gravitational  field  as  a  gage  field,  acting  on  equal  terms  with  other

2

fundamental fields [3]. Such approach lacks in apriority gives no restrictions on the microscopic

level. For an elementary spinor source with a mass m0, the set of equations describing its states

in the proper gravitational field in accordance with the adopted assumption will have the form

The  following  notations  are  used  throughout  the  text  of the  paper: k

 
'  =  =
8p G/c4, En is the energy of stationary states in the proper gravitational field with the constant K,

  =  8p K/c4, k

  = k

, rn  is  the  value  of  the  coordinate r  satisfying  the  equilibrium  n-state  in  the  proper

gravitational field,

=k

k 0k

, k 0 is the dimensionality constant, Sa =

, (cid:209)

(cid:541) is the spinor-

a

coupling  covariant  derivative  independent  of  twisting, E'n  is  the  energy  state  of  the  particle
having a mass mn (either free of field or in the external field), described by the wave function y

'

in  the  proper  gravitational  field  with  the  constant G.    The  rest  of  the  notations  are  generally

adopted in the gravitation theory.

         Equations (1)  through (5) describe the equilibrium states of particles (stationary states)  in

the proper gravitational field and define the localization region of the field characterized by the

constant (cid:580) that satisfies the equilibrium state. These stationary states are sources of the field with

the constant G, and condition (3) provides matching the solution with the gravitational constants

(cid:580) and G. The  proposed  model  in  the  physical  aspect  is  compatible  with  the  principles  of
quantum mechanics principles, and the gravitational field with the constants (cid:580) and L

 at a certain,

quite  definite  distance  specified  by  the  equilibrium  state  transforms  into  the  filed  having  the

constant G and satisfying, in the weak field limit, the Poisson equation.

The set of equations (1) through (5), first of all, is of interest for the problem of stationary

states,  i.e.,  the  problem  of  energy  spectrum  calculations  for  an  elementary  source  in  the  own

gravitational  field.  In  this  sense  it  is  reasonable  to  use  an  analogy  with  electrodynamics,  in

particular, with the problem of electron stationary states in the Coulomb field. Transition  from

the Schrödinger  equation to  the Klein-Gordon relativistic  equations allows taking  into  account

the fine structure of the electron energy spectrum in the Coulomb field, whereas transition to the

Dirac  equation  allows  taking  into  account  the  relativistic  fine  structure  and  the  energy  level

splitting associated with spin-orbital interaction. Using this analogy and the form of equation (1),

one can conclude that solution of this equation without the term

5

 gives a spectrum

similar to that of the fine structure (similar in the sense of relativism and removal of the principal

quantum number degeneracy).. Taking the term

5

5

 into account, as is noted in [1], is

similar to  taking  into  account  of the term

FY

  in the  Pauli equation.  The  latter  implies

that the solution of the problem of stationary states with twisting taken into account will give a

total  energy-state  spectrum  with  both  the  relativistic  fine  structure  and  energy  state  splitting

caused by spin-twist interaction taken into account. This fact, being in complete accord with the

requirements  of    the  Gauge  Theory  of  Gravity,  allows  us  to  believe  that  the  above-stated

assumptions  concerning  the  properties  of  the  gravitational  field  in  the  quantum  region  are

relevant, in the general case, just to the gravitational field with twists.

Complexity  of  solving  this  problem  compels  us  to  employ  a  simpler  approximation,

namely:  energy  spectrum  calculations  in  a  relativistic  fine-structure  approximation.  In  this

approximation  the  problem  of  the  stationary  states  of  an  elementary  source  in  the  proper

gravitational field well be reduced to solving the following equations:

Condition  (9)  defines rn,, whereas  equations  (10)  through  (12)  are  the  boundary

conditions and the normalization condition for the function

,f

 respectively. Condition (9) in the

general case  has the  form R(K,rn) = R(G,rn). Neglecting  the proper gravitational field with the

constant G, we shall write  down this condition as R(K,rn) =  0, to  which equality (9)   actually

corresponds.

The  right-hand  sides  of  equations  (7)—(8)  are  calculated  basing  on  the  general

where  mutually  compensating  action  of  the  field  and  the  particle  takes  place.  With l  =  0  the

gravitational field, the values r1 = 2.82 x 10-15 m, Kl = 0.41 x 1012 m-1 giving exact zero of the
function by the very definition of the numerical values for (cid:580) and L

.

So, the presented numerical estimates  for the electron show  that within the range  of its
localization, with K~ 1031N m2 kg-2 and L ~ 1029m-2, there exists the spectrum of stationary states

in  the  pr(cid:616)per  gravitational  field.  The  numerical  value  of K  is,  certainly,  universal  for  any
elementary source, whereas the value of L

 is defined by the rest mass of the elementary source.

The  distance  at  which  the  gravitational  field  with  the  constant  (cid:580)  is  localized  is  less  than  the

Compton wavelength, and for the electron, for example, this value is of the order of its classical

radius. At distances larger than this one, the gravitational field is characterized by the constant G,

i.e., correct transition to Classical GTR holds.

From equation  (27)  there  follow  in  a  rough approximation  the  numerical  values  of the

stationary state energies: E1 =0.511 MeV, E2 =0.638 MeV, ... E¥ =0.681 MeV.

Quantum  transitions  over  stationary  states  must  lead  to  the  gravitational  emission

characterized by the constant K with transition energies starting from 127 keV to 170 keV Two

circumstances are essential here.

First.  The  correspondence  between  the  electromagnetic  and  gravitational  interaction

takes place on replacement of the electric charge e by the gravitational "charge" m K , so that

the numerical values K place the electromagnetic and gravitational emission effects on the same

level  (for  instance,  the  electromagnetic  and  gravitational  bremsstrahlung  cross-sections  will

differ only by the factor 0.16 in the region of coincidence of the emission spectra).

Second. The natural width of the  energy levels  in the above-indicated spectrum of  the
electron stationary states will be  from 10-9  eV  to  10-7  eV.  The  small  value  of the  energy level

widths, compared to the electron energy spread in real conditions, explains why the gravitational

emission effects are not observed as a mass phenomenon in epiphenomena, e.g., in the processes

of electron beam bremsstrahlung on targets. A direct confirmation of the presence of the electron

stationary states in the own gravitational field with the constant  K may be the presence of the
lower  boundary  of  nuclear b -decay.  Only  starting  with  this  boundary b -asymmetry  can  take

place, which is interpreted as parity non-conservation in weak interactions, but is actually only a
consequence of the presence of the excited states of electrons in the own gravitational field in b -

decay.  Beta-asymmetry  was  observed  experimentally  only  in b -decay  of  heavy  nuclei  in
magnetic  field  (for  example, 27C60  in  the  known  experiment  carried  out  by  Wu  [7].  On  light
nuclei,  such  as 1H3,  where  the b -decay  asymmetry  already  must  not  take  place,  similar

experiments were not carried out.

2. Gravitational Emission in Dense High-Temperature Plasma

2.1. Excitation of Gravitational Emission in Plasma

For the above-indicated energies of transitions over stationary states in the own field and

the energy level widths, the sole object in which gravitational emission can be realized as a mass

phenomenon  will  be,  as  follows  from  the  estimates  given  below,  a  dense  high-temperature

plasma.

Using the  Born approximation for  the bremsstrahlung cross-section, we can write down

the expression for the electromagnetic bremsstrahlung per unit of volume per unit of time as

where  Te, k, ni, ne, m, z, ro are the electron temperature, Boltzmann's  constant, the concentration

of  the  ionic  and  electronic  components,  the  electron  mass,  the  serial  number  of  the  ionic

component, the classical electron radius, respectively.

 

Replacing ro by rg = 2K m/c2 (which corresponds to replacing the electric charge e by the

gravitational charge

Km

), we can use for the gravitational bremsstrahlung the relation

Qg = 0.16Qe.

(29)

From (28)  it  follows that  in a dense high-temperature plasma with parameters ne =  ni =

1023 m-3, Te = 107 K, the specific power of the electromagnetic bremsstrahlung is equal to »
 0.53
1010 J/m3 s, and the specific power of the gravitational bremsstrahlung is 0.86 109 J/m3 s. These

values  of  the  plasma  parameters,  apparently,  can  be  adopted  as  guide  threshold  values  of  an

appreciable gravitational emission level,  because the relative proportion of the electrons whose

energy  on  the  order  of  the  energy  of transitions  in  the  own    gravitational  field,  diminishes  in

accordance with the Maxwellian distribution exponent as Te decreases.

2.2. Amplification of Gravitational Emission in Plasma

For  the  numerical  values  of  the  plasma  parameters  Te  =  Ti  =  (!07—108)K,  ne  =  ni  =
 
(1023—1025)  m-3  the electromagnetic  bremsstrahlung spectrum will not  change essentially with

Compton scattering of electron emission,  and the  bremsstrahlung  itself is a source of emission

losses  of  a  high-temperature  plasma.  The  frequencies  of  this  continuous  spectrum  are  on  the
order of (1018—1020)  s-1,  while the plasma  frequency  for  the above-cited plasma parameters is
(1013—1014) s-1, or 0.1 eV of the energy of emitted quanta.

The fundamental distinction of the gravitational bremsstrahlung from the electromagnetic

bremsstrahlung  is  the  banded  spectrum  of  the  gravitational  emission,  corresponding  to  the

spectrum of the electron stationary states in the own gravitational field.

 

The presence of cascade transitions from the upper excited levels to the lower ones will

lead to that the electrons, becoming excited in the energy region above 100 keV, will be emitted,

mainly,  in  the  eV  region,  i.e.,  energy transfer  along  the  spectrum  to  the  low-frequency  region

will take place. Such energy transfer mechanism can take place only in quenching spontaneous

emission  from the  lower  electron  energy levels  in the  own gravitational  field,  which  rules  out

emission  with  quantum energy  in  the  keV  region.  A  detailed  description  of the  mechanism  of

energy  transfer  along  the  spectrum  will  hereafter  give  its  precise  numerical  characteristics.

Nevertheless, undoubtedly, the very fact of its existence, conditioned by the banded character of

the spectrum of the gravitational bremsstrahlung,  can be asserted. The  low-frequency character

9

of the gravitational bremsstrahlung spectrum will lead to its amplification in plasma by virtue of

the locking condition

 being fulfilled.

 

From  the  standpoint  of  practical  realization  of  the  states  of  a  high-temperature  plasma

compressed by the emitted gravitational field, two circumstances are of importance.

First.  Plasma  must  comprise  two  components,  with  multiply  charged  ions  added  to

hydrogen, these ions being necessary for quenching spontaneous emission of electrons from the

ground energy levels in the own gravitational field. For this purpose it is necessary to have ions

with the energy levels of electrons close to the energy levels of free excited electrons. Quenching

of  the  lower  excited  states  of  the  electrons  will  be  particularly  effective  in  the  presence  of  a

resonance between the energy of excited electron and the energy of electron excitation in the ion

(in  the  limit,  most  favorable  case  —  ionization  energy).  An  increase  of  z  increases  also  the

specific  power  of  the  gravitational  bremsstrahlung,  so  that  on  the  condition

being  fulfilled, the equality of the gas-kinetic pressure and the radiation pressure

t = (10-6 —10-7) s for the permissible parameter values of compressed plasma

Second. The necessity of plasma ejection from the region of the magnetic field with the
tentative  parameters  ne  =  (1023  —  1024)  m-3,  Te  =  (107  —  108)  K  with  subsequent  energy

pumping from the magnetic field region.

2.3. States of hydrostatic equilibrium of the plasma in the emitted gravitational field

An analysis of the processes [8, 9] which take place in the known devices for generating

stable  high-temperature  states  of  a  plasma  (as  well  as  the  absence  of  encouraging  results)

suggests that the magnetic field can be used only partially, in the first step for the retention and

heating plasma in the process of forming its high-energy state. Further presence of the magnetic

field no  longer confines the plasma within a limited volume, but destroys this plasma owing to

the specific character of motion of charged particles in the magnetic field. A principal solution of

the  problem  is  a  method  of  confining  of  an  already  heated  plasma  in  an  emitted  gravitational

field  in  a  second  step,  after  the  plasma  has  been  compressed,  heated  and  retained  during  this

period  by  the  magnetic      field.  As  follows  from  the  above-stated,  under  any  circumstances

plasma must be injected from the magnetic field region, but with subsequent pumping of energy

from the region of the plasma found in the magnetic field.

The fulfillment of the above-cited conditions (in principle, irrespective of a particular scheme of

the apparatus in which these conditions are realized), and namely:

a)  generation of a dense high-temperature plasma from hydrogen and isotopes thereof with the

aid of pulsed heavy-current discharges;

b) injection of the plasma from the area of a magnetic field with parameters corresponding to the

conditions of gravitational emission of electrons with a banded energy spectrum;

c) energy transfer along the spectrum performed by cascade transition into the long wavelength

region of eV-energy to the state of locking and  amplification of the gravitational emission and

simultaneous compression to   the states of hydrostatic equilibrium,  and  in the formation of the

states, mentioned for the stage c)  in the composition of a working gas multielectron atoms are

used for quenching the spontaneous gravitational emission from the ground energy levels of the

keV-region electron in its own gravitational field,

solves  solely  the  problem  of  attaining  hydrostatic  equilibrium  states  of  plasma.  The  use  of  a

multielectron gas (carbon) as the additive to hydrogen leads to the realization of nuclear fusion

reaction  conditions,  since  carbon  will  simultaneously  will  act  as  a  catalyst  required  for  the

nuclear fusion reaction [10].

 

Another  variant  of  nuclear  fusion  in  compositions  with  multielectron  atoms,  such  as

xenon,  krypton  (and  allied  elements)  is  the  use  as  the  light  component  of  deuterium  or  a

deuterium-tritium  mixture  (the  last-mentioned  variant  is  the  most  cumbersome  one  because  of

the forming of neutrons during the fusion).

Conclusion

1. The  approximation  of  Einstein’s  relativistic  gravitation  equations  is  examined,

wherein  the  values  of  gravitational  constant  K  and  constant L

  in  the  region  of  elementary

particles localization are defined in such a way that this leads to stationary states of the particles

in their own gravitational field, and the particles stationary states themselves are the sources of

the field with Newtonian gravitational constant G.

2. The  consequences  of  the  quantum  character  of  gravitational  interaction,  which  are

available for experimental testing, are:

a) asymmetry of electrons  scattering  on  the  energies  in b -decay  in  the  strong  magnetic

b) state  of  hydrostatic  equilibrium  of  dense  high-temperature  plasma  in  the  emitted

field;

gravitational field.

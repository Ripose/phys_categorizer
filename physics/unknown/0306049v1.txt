Fluctuation spatial expansion and observational redshifts

Abstract 

Classical determinations of galaxy distances and galaxy recessional 

velocities have been generated from luminosity and emission spectrometric data. 

The analyses of these galactic spectrometric electromagnetic frequency shifts 

have resulted in the Hubble law and are understood as a Doppler effect stemming 

from an expansion of space. In the present work, a galaxy-core expansion model 

with a time evolving matter and radiation distribution is put forth, leading to a 

supplementary treatment of the optical redshift measurements. Einstein's 

gravitational equations are assumed to apply within a galaxy-core spatial domain 

and, with utilization of a generalized Robertson-Walker-Schwarzschild metric, are 

used in order to calculate the evolutionary expansion characteristics. The galaxy-

core model is described as a flat metric, matter plus radiation, σ = 1/3, energy 

distribution. It predicts an early time density fluctuation collapse, understood to 

be the formation of a galaxy hole, and provides an interpretational basis for the 

experimental data.

INTRODUCTION 

In the early part of the century, Hubble and Humason1 cataloged the 

recessional velocities, relative to our Milky Way galaxy, of numerous galaxies, 

thereby identifying the velocity versus distance relationship now known as the 

Hubble law. Recessional velocities were calculable from analyses of the 

spectroscopic data associated with the individual light sources while distances 

were determined from the apparent magnitudes of these sources. It is now 

believed that these optical Doppler frequency shifts arise from a cosmological 

expansion of the intervening space itself2, rather than from a motion of the 

galaxies through space3,4. 

In the present work, it is proposed that the observational expansion 

measurements derive from conditions in the local galactic environments. That is, 

the recessional velocity or redshift data are primarily measurements of the state of 

expansion in the emitting and observing galaxies. To further explore this 

description, the inter- and intra-galactic radiation emission, transmission, and 

detection processes are approximated into three regions of differing gravitational 

characteristics. For the emitting and observing galaxy regions, a galaxy-core 

model is developed to facilitate calculation of the pertinent expansion states and 

therefore the redshifts.

Figure 1 illustrates a diagrammatic space and time pictorial of the galaxy, 

space, and radiation propagation conditions. Within the galactic regions, that is 

the emission and detection regions, an analysis of the propagation process 

requires examining the local expansion states since they effect the radiation. To 

this end, the galaxy-core model begins with an Einsteinian gravitational treatment 

of the early matter and radiation density fluctuation defining the core. 

Einstein's gravitational equations5, when qualified to an isotropic 

homogeneous space, have been solved by Friedmann5 to yield the classic 

expanding universe equations for a perfect fluid, or continuous matter 

distribution;

where a is the time evolving spatial expansion parameter and k is the space

As a similar model for the present calculations, the galaxy-core has been 

described in evolutionary terms as a continuous matter and radiation density 

fluctuation with σ = 1/3, with a flat space metric (producing an associated radius 

dependent attraction), and beginning at time tcore-birth. This is an evolving spatial 

and matter region, which subsequently begins collapsing (hole augmentation) at a 

time tcollapse. However, describing this spherically symmetric, radial coordinate 

centered, density fluctuation region requires a modified metric, which in the 

present treatment utilizes a combination of the Robertson-Walker form with a 

Schwarzschild form to yield

Similar solutions are found for the k = 1 and k = -1 cases. Applying the flat 

metric solution for α to the region exterior to the total mass M, with the boundary 

condition at infinity, requires B1 = 0 and results in zero curvature energy, 

consistent with the starting use of the flat metric. For the static case, comparison

Interior to the mass distribution, solution (10) contains a classical

describe distributions containing both a distributed mass and a central core mass 

element such as a hole. Following the development of Bergmann6, that is,

The Schwarzschild hole radius is denoted by rhole. Therefore, although the flat 

space description holds at large r exterior to the matter, the metric produces an 

attractive, positive-curvature-like behavior in the interior of the mass distribution.  

For other than flat spaces and in the regions external to the mass, the 

resulting k(r) values are k(r) = -α2 for k = +1 and k(r) = α2 for k = -1. The mass 

interior region could also be treated with either the k = +1, or k = -1 descriptions, 

however, the initial density conditions are assumed those of a flat space. 

The time dependent expansion parameter, density and temperature 

solutions for equation (9) (curvature k = -ε(r)  = B1α(r), σ = 1/3) are,

The zero subscripts for the density Ωs0 and the temperature T0 (as for the Hubble 

constant H0 and the expansion parameter as0) denote present day values. Radiation 

energy density ratio Ωr = Ωr0/Ωs0 expresses the present-day fractional radiation 

energy component (radiation energy/matter energy). Although the time value for 

the region's initial collapse, tcollapse, (with radial coordinate rhole) is an input to the 

solution, absent a physical mechanism to explain an inhibition of collapse, the 

spatial region at the center of the mass, at r = rorigin ≡ rhole, will begin to collapse 

immediately at t = tcore-birth. Under these circumstances, the qualitative expansion 

behavior is not affected but quantitatively the collapse process merely begins at 

the earlier time. 

given by the expression,  

The approximate time at which collapse occurs, at a given mass radius, is

where ri is the radius at the mass shell in question and rorigin is the beginning

inside of which α is negative and the "curvature term" is positive. A negatively 

curved, approximately flat, region exists between the singularity surface and rg. 

The metric factor α is plotted in Fig. 2.   

Bounds on the galaxy-core birth time are forthcoming from consideration 

of the galaxy-core mass radius and the hole mass extremum at the singularity 

radius. If the initial mass distribution's maximum radius at time tcore-birth  is less 

than or equal to the singularity radius for that mass, then all of the region will 

eventually collapse but the collapse process and the mass distribution itself will be

unobservable to regions outside the Schwarzschild radius, which is the singularity 

radius in this case. Model cases with smaller masses or later galaxy birth times 

will additionally contain the second, more rapidly expanding, negatively curved 

region mentioned above. A mass distribution with a mass-radius equal to the 

singularity radius possesses the interesting characteristic that the curvature of the 

region at the mass-space boundary is zero, thereby exhibiting equality across the 

boundary of both the curvature factor and the metric factor α. 

If one assumes that present day galaxy holes derive from such a collapse 

process and that the present day hole mass (neglecting accretion processes) 

represents the current collapsed mass, then for the two region model, an upper 

bound to the birth-time can be calculated by utilizing the radius of the collapsed 

mass today. The calculation sets the collapsed mass radius, which equals rg ∗ 

(hole mass ratio)1/3, equal to the singularity radius. This upper time bound is 

calculated to be 0.32 years, for a galaxy-core mass of 109 stellar masses (density 

Ωs0 relates the galaxy-core radius to the galaxy-core mass) using equation (17) for 

the space expansion factor for a "radiation plus matter" universe and 1.5% for the 

hole-mass/core-mass ratio. For mass and birth-time combinations greater than the 

upper extremum, the present day collapsed mass will be less than the 

experimental hole value referred to above. The calculational result for the lower 

time bound for the galaxy-core birth time (resulting for a galaxy-core mass radius 

that approaches the singularity radius) is 0.05 years. This dependence of birth

times on galaxy-core mass is illustrated in Fig. 3. Figure 4 displays the growing 

collapse zone as a function of time for a galaxy-core birth time of 0.32 years or a 

present-day collapsed mass radius of 0.99∗ 3/2∗ rs. Figure 5 shows the range of 

collapse times as a function of the galactic-core radial coordinate. For birth times 

close to the upper extremum, the model exhibits a linear core-mass dependence 

(see Fig. 6) in good agreement with the experimental latter-day galaxy hole 

measurements; Kormendy7, Magorrian8, and Kormendy9 have shown such a 

galaxy bulge-mass correlation (also see Fig. 2 in Gebhardt10). 

The variable Texperimental is the cosmic microwave background temperature 

and is utilized as the intra-galaxy reference. It reflects the anticipated impact of a 

different expansion factor for intragalaxy space and intergalaxy space. 

Temperature is assumed to follow an a-1 behavior throughout; after collapse, 

however, since the expansion factor loses its definition, an arbitrary value is 

assigned which is derived from the first collapsing mass-shell radius, that is  

       acollapse = acore-birth ( ΩGal core(tcore- birth) /Ωhole (t1st collapse) ) 1/ 3  .  

The cosmological density, Ωs0, and other model parameters are either 

experimental or observationally estimated. For the following expansion 

parameter, density and temperature calculations, an early birth-time perspective is 

used where tcore- birth = 0.32 years, galaxy-core mass = 109 stellar masses, Ωs0 = 1, 

ρcritical = 7.2 ×10-27 kg m-3 and Hubble's constant H0 = 0.485×10-10/year producing 

D.R.Koehler 

 

 

13

an age of 13.7×109 years. In the spirit of the present model, the Hubble constant is 

interpreted as a local galactic-based expansion measurement rather than an 

intergalactic spatial measurement. Also in the present model, for a t2/3 time 

behavior of the expansion parameter, t(now) ≈ 2/3∗H0

-1. 

Before time tcore-birth the universe is assumed governed by an expansion, 

space density and temperature behavior determined by radiation and matter 

energy;

where Ω's0 ≡ Ω's(a'0) and Ω'r0  ≡ Ω'r(a'0). Radiation modifies the time evolution but 

the intergalaxy, or space, expansion is the approximate t2/3 behavior of the k = 

0(zero) flat universe. Temperature reflects the impact of an observer measuring an 

intergalactic expansion-state parameter a'(t) from within a galaxy with expansion 

parameter a(t, r).   

The presence at time tcore- birth of a density fluctuation, begins the departure 

from relative uniformity which describes the early universe with acore(tcore- birth) = 

aintergalaxy(tcore-birth). In the present perfect fluid modeling, the description provided 

D.R.Koehler 

 

 

14

by equation (9) only incorporates the gravitational physics of the collapsing 

galaxy-core space. Any subsequent matter accretion processes, or other energy 

sources, are not included. The continuous matter and radiation energy of the early 

universe, constituting the galaxy-core material, is considered the perfect fluid 

used to determine the expansion factor solution form. Figures 7-9 display the 

results of the calculations for the evolutionary character of the galaxy-core 

expansion parameter, the galaxy-core density function, and the galaxy-core 

temperature. The marked behavior at tcollapse(r) reflects the collapse of the space, 

and the associated matter and radiation energy, responsible for hole augmentation. 

A present hole mass value, as mentioned earlier, equal to 1.5% of the galaxy 

bulge-mass (we have associated the galaxy bulge-mass with our core-mass), has 

been used for the growing hole. Its radius is assumed to be the Schwarzschild 

value. A terminal radius after collapse other than the Schwarzschild value is 

possible but not predictable from the model. Moreover, the concept of a collapsed 

spatial singularity has not been otherwise treated in the present calculational 

analysis. For Figures 7-9, the hole-radius unit value is that of the hole at the time t 

= 2 tcore- birth. Both a spatial "z" definition, z = aspa (today)/aspa (t) - 1, and a 

galaxy-observer "z" definition, z = aobs (today, robs)/aobs (t, robs) - 1 are plotted in 

Fig. 8. The galaxy-observer is positioned at 0.75 × core-radius and because the 

expansion parameter in the outer region of the model core-mass distribution 

behaves quite differently from the exterior spatial region, there is a significant 

difference in the redshift functions. All of the galaxy-core region internal to the 

D.R.Koehler 

 

 

15

singularity shell-radius is predicted to collapse eventually but the collapse time 

follows an inverse curvature dependence which results in infinitely long collapse 

times, tcollapse(r) = π C1 / k(r)3/2, as the curvature, k, approaches zero at the 

singularity transition edge. The time evolution of the galaxy-core expansion 

parameter, in the outer regions of the mass distribution, follows the negative 

curvature behavior,

After a region collapses, the galaxy-core density function for that region is the 

hole density function and, as displayed in Fig. 8, the density is that of the growing 

Schwarzschild-radius hole. 

3.  OBSERVATIONAL REDSHIFT MODELING 

D.R.Koehler 

 

 

16

For the radiation emission and detection process, the photon propagation 

behavior along the time evolving emitter to observer path, is determined by the 

equation for null geodesics and integration over time along the light path. This 

leads to the expression relating the emitted and observed time intervals11,

and illustrates that only the initial and final expansion states, aj(ti) (i = emitter 

time or observer time, j = emitter or observer), determine the overall resultant 

change in frequency or wavelength of the propagating radiation. In other words, 

in a non-monolithic universe where local warping is present and where radiation 

emission sources and radiation observers (detectors) are both embedded in such 

locally warped regions, calculation of the radiation modification (redshift) 

involves calculation of the local region's expansion state as manifest in the local 

expansion parameter aj(ti). The potential energy, or wavelength, diagram 

illustrated in Fig. 10 is a pictorial representation of the evolving photon energy 

state as it propagates (1), through the emitting galaxy, (2), out of the galaxy-space 

D.R.Koehler 

 

 

17

interface, (3), through the spatially expanding path between emitting and 

observing galaxies, (4), into the observer space-galaxy interface, and finally, (5), 

to the detection point within the observer galaxy. The observer galaxy and the 

emitter galaxy are assumed to exhibit the same time evolutionary or expansion 

characteristics. In such a path, the wavelength stretching (photon energy loss) step 

at the emitter galaxy-space interface and the energy loss process during 

intergalactic travel is mirrored at the second observer space-galaxy interface 

where the energy loss is partially recovered and the photon wavelength decreases. 

The expanding galaxy regions therefore produce the net overall energy change, or 

photon wavelength increase, during the time interval from emission to detection. 

If the aemitter and aobserver evolution lines corresponded to the same t2/3 time 

behavior as aspace, then no energy loss or recovery would be incurred at the space-

galaxy interfaces. Although the present model calculations are limited to the core 

expansion-factor time-development, the notion of local space warping and its 

impact on the propagating radiation is still appropriate. 

If the galaxy environment influences radiation redshifting, then 

microwave background radiation (CBR) is also affected and should display a 

wavelength offset equivalent to the ratio between present-day galaxy-space and 

intergalaxy-space, expansion parameter values;

A radiation evolution and propagation diagram is shown in Fig. 11 and, as 

illustrated, suggests an actual inter-galaxy background radiation temperature 

lower (longer wavelength) than measured inside the galaxy. However, since 

aspace(today) is probably greater than that in the outer regions of the galaxy, a less-

than-one CBR offset is predicted for observers in these regions. That is, 

appropriate galaxy models, with observers in high mass-density regions, would 

predict a smaller intergalaxy CBR temperature than that which is measured, a 

phenomenon that derives from the local space warping produced by the galaxy 

matter. For an observer in the outer regions (at 0.75∗ rg ) of the core-mass 

distribution used here, for example, the offset is 9.6. 

4.  SUMMARY 

In conclusion, the galaxy-cores, as modeled, display radius-dependent 

expansion rates and exhibit time evolution rates greater than t2/3 dependencies in 

the outer regions while the inner regions are collapsing. We postulate from this 

modeling that cosmological redshift data should be interpreted as measurements 

of a localized galactic expansion parameter, both at the emitter and at the 

D.R.Koehler 

 

 

19

observer, and that cosmic microwave background radiation measurements should 

be impacted by the difference between galaxy and intergalaxy expansion rates.  

5.  APPENDIX  

As a second consideration of a galaxy-core birth-time minimum, a light 

crossing time interval, or gravitational propagation time interval, associated with 

coherent evolution of the mass fluctuation is required. Calculation of this 

equilibration time interval as tequil = 2rg /c leads to a core-birth time 

approximately that of the upper-bound birth-time extremum. Positing that tequil  ≅  

tupper extremum then constrains the hole-mass/core-mass ratio (no longer a free model 

parameter). Therefore, with mh-c ≡ hole-mass/core-mass ratio,

With such a gravitational coherence-time requirement and the merging of the 

lower-bound birth timeline into the upper-bound birth timeline, all mass 

distribution fluctuations in the model are then described as the two-region type, 

being born along an upper-bound extremum timeline (as in Fig. 3), which is

The calculational result for mh-c is mh-c = 3.9×10-3. Since no accretion processes 

are included, the result should be compared (as a lower limit value) to the 

experimental data of Magorrian8, where log(Mhole/Mbulge) = -2.28 (mean with 

std.dev. = 0.51) or Mhole/Mbulge = 5.2×10-3.

Abstract 

The design of the Linac Coherent Light Source assumes that a low-emittance, 1-nC, 10-ps 
beam will be available for injection into the 15-GeV linac. The proposed rf photocathode 
injector  that  will  provide  a  150-MeV  beam  with  rms  normalized  emittances  of  1  µm  in 
both the transverse and longitudinal dimensions is based on a 1.6-cell S-band rf gun that is 
equipped with an emittance compensating solenoid. The booster accelerator is positioned 
at  the  beam  waist  coinciding  with  the  first  emittance  maximum  and  is  provided  with  an 
accelerating gradient of ~25 MeV/m, i.e., the "new working point." The uv pulses required 
for cathode excitation will be generated by tripling the output of a Ti:sapphire laser system 
consisting of a highly stable cw mode-locked oscillator and two bow-tie amplifiers pumped 
by  a  pair  of  Q-switched  Nd:YAG  lasers.  The  large  bandwidth  of  the  Ti:sapphire  system 
accommodates the desired temporal pulse shaping. Details of the design and the supporting 
simulations are presented.

1. Introduction 

 

The  proposed  Linac  Coherent  Light  Source  (LCLS)  is  an  x-ray  free  electron  laser 

(FEL)  that  will  use  the  final  third  of  the  SLAC  3-km  linac  for  the  drive  beam.  The 

performance of the LCLS in the 1.5 Å regime is predicated on the availability of a 1-nC, 

100-A beam at the 150-MeV point with normalised rms transverse emittance of 1 µm. A 

low energy spread,  both  integrated and slice, and low charge and timing jitters are also 

required. The initial injector design made use of a low-gradient booster as was then the 

standard [1]. An improved design that better meets the LCLS requirements is the subject 

of this paper. 

The basic layout of the injector is shown in Fig. 1. This layout is consistent with the 

concept of a “new working point” that was introduced in 1999 [2]. The basic difference 

seen in this design compared to the earlier version is that the drift distance between the 

gun and booster is greater and also the booster accelerating gradient is much higher. Note 

that a relatively weak solenoidal field is now used around the first booster section instead 

of discrete focusing coils between sections. 

2. Gun and cathode 
 

The  LCLS  gun  will  be  a  modified  version  of  the  BNL/SLAC/UCLA  symmetrized 

1.6-cell rf photocathode gun [3]. The principal differences are the addition of a load-lock 

to better ensure cathode performance and improved cooling to allow operation at 120 Hz. 

In addition, the rf power for the LCLS gun will be fed symmetrically into the full cell in 

order to eliminate higher order modes. To increase its heat capacity, the standard 1.6-cell 

 

2 

gun will be modified by increasing the number and size of the water cooling channels and 

pushing  them  closer  to  the  iris  and  cathode  surface  without  compromising  structural 

integrity [4]. 

A copper photocathode is chosen because the entire end plate of the half cell can be 

formed  in  the  standard  manner  of  rf  cavities,  permitting  operation  at  the  highest  field 

values. The photoelectric response time of metal cathodes is on the sub-picosecond level, 

thus imposing  no limitation on the desired  temporal pulse shaping.   Since  the  source is 

not  required  to  produce  multiple  microbunches  within  each  pulse,  the  lower  quantum 

efficiency (QE) of metal cathodes compared to alkali and semiconductor  photocathodes 

is  not  a  major  concern.  The  QE  for  Cu  illuminated  with  uv  light  depends  on  surface 

preparation, but 10-5 for normal incidence at 266 nm (4.7 eV) in a non-load-locked gun 

is achievable [5,6,7]. Much better QE is available from copper installed through a load-

lock.  This  is  illustrated  by  the  data  of  Fig.  2  for  which  a  carefully  prepared 

polycrystalline  Cu  photocathode  was  inserted  into  high  vacuum  surface  diagnostic 

chamber using a load-lock (no baking) and the QE spectrum measured at low voltage [8]. 

The figure shows a QE of 2.3×10-4 at 266 nm. 

At 266 nm, an optical pulse of 500 µJ on the cathode is required to produce 1 nC of 

charge  when  the  QE  is  10–5.  A  laser  system  to  meet  this  requirement  is  described  in 

Section 3. 

Copper  photocathodes  made  from  single-crystal  Cu  have  proven  to  have  not  a  only 

high QE but also low dark current [9]. In addition, the QE uniformity across the cathode 

surface appears to be superior to polycrystalline Cu. Single-crystal copper boules with a 

 

3 

diameter sufficient to fabricate the back plane of an S-band gun are available, thus the use 

of a cathode plug can be avoided even for single-crystal Cu cathodes. 

3. Laser 
 

The  laser  system  for  illuminating  the  cathode  is  essentially  unchanged  from  that 

shown  in  reference  [1].  A  cw  mode-locked  Ti:sapphire  oscillator,  pumped  by  a  diode-

pumped Nd:YVO4 laser, delivers a stable, continuous pulse train of 12-nJ, 100-fs pulses 

at  a  repetition  rate  of  79.33  MHz.  This  frequency,  the  36th  subharmonic  of  the  linac’s 

2856-MHz rf, locks the timing of the laser pulses to the phase of the rf in the linac and rf 

gun.  The  wavelength  is  tuned  to  798  nm  and  tripled  to  266  nm  after  amplification  to 

provide a suitable wavelength for the photocathode.  

A Pockels cell and polarizer are used to gate single pulses, at 120 Hz, from the 79.33-

MHz  pulse  train.  The  energy  of  such  selected  pulses  is  increased  in  a  two-stage 

Ti:sapphire rod amplifier  system using a four-pass  bow-tie configuration for each stage  

[10].  Both  are  pumped  by  a  pair  of  Q-switched,  doubled  Nd:YAG  lasers  that  fire  in 

alternation, each producing a 60-Hz train of 3 to 10-ns pulses. Relay imaging is used to 

maintain  a  good  transverse  mode  while  efficiently  filling  the  pumped  volume  of  the 

Ti:sapphire rods. 

The  large  oscillator  bandwidth  (of  order  1%)  enables  transformed-limited  ultrashort 

pulse-width  capability  and  use  of  the  well-established  chirped  pulse  amplification  [11] 

technique  to  reduce  peak  power  levels  in  the  amplifier  stages.  With  this  scheme,  pulse 

stretching  to  hundreds  of  picoseconds  is  accomplished  by  imposing  a  positive  chirp  on 

 

4 

the waveform of the pulse. Following amplification the stretched pulses are compressed 

by reversing the imposed chirp. 

The  temporal pulse shape is determined by  modifying (under computer  control) the 

oscillator  output  spectrum.  Additional  pulse-width  flexibility  is  afforded  by  partial 

compression of the stretched, amplified pulses. 

After  the  second  amplifier,  the  transverse  shape  of  the  pulse  is  modified  from 

Gaussian to uniform to better match the requirements for obtaining a low emittance from 

the gun. Next, two crystals triple the frequency of the light to a wavelength of 266 nm. 

The  spatially  flattened  pulse  also  improves  efficiency  and  uniformity  in  this  harmonic-

generation process. 

Finally, the beam is transported through an evacuated tube to an optics platform next 

to the gun. Since the Fourier-relay image plane that follows the long transport tube has a 

spot size that is too small for the photocathode, the spot is magnified and imaged onto a 

circular aperture that slightly trims the edge of the beam. This aperture is in turn imaged 

onto  the  photocathode,  so  that  the  illuminated  region  of  the  photocathode  is  precisely 

defined  without  jitter.  The  imaging  includes  compensation  for  the  temporal  and  spatial 

distortion that results if grazing incidence on the photocathode is used. 

The  net  energy  transmission  of  the  laser  system  is  as  follows:  transmission  through 

the  spatial  flattener  is  about  50%,  through  the  compressor  50%,  through  the  frequency 

tripling stage 25%, and through the optical transport to the gun 50%. If grazing incidence 

is  used,  the  final  steering  optic  will  be  a  uv  grating.  Appropriate  choice  of  coating, 

polarization,  blazing  angle  and  groove  density  of  the  grating  can  yield  first  order  uv 

 

5 

diffraction  efficiencies  in  excess  of  90%.  Consequently,  starting  with  18  mJ  after  the 

second amplifier, the required 500 µJ is delivered to the cathode.  

 

4. Simulations 
 

Using  the  semi-analytic  code  HOMDYN  [12],  a  wide  range  of  injector  parameters 

was  investigated  earlier  under  the  constraints  imposed  by  the  invariant-envelope  [13] 

matching  condition:  injection  into  the  matched  accelerating  gradient  of  the  booster  at  a 

laminar  waist.  As  a  result,  it  was  found  that  by  increasing  the  gun  focusing  solenoid 

strength so that the waist also occurs when the emittance has its relative maximum, the 

second emittance maximum can be shifted to higher energy with a lower final emittance 

value than previously achieved [2,14]. This new configuration is here referred to as the 

“new working point.” 

The LCLS injector has been designed using version 3 of the LANL-maintained code 

PARMELA to establish the details of the “new working point.” The electric field map of 

the gun was obtained with SUPERFISH  and  directly  used in  PARMELA.  SUPERFISH 

was also used to simulate the fields in the traveling-wave accelerating sections, and space 

harmonics  were  calculated  to  be  used  in  PARMELA.  RF  fields  were  assumed  to  be 

cylindrically symmetric. A magnetic field map for the emittance compensating solenoid 

at the gun was produced using POISSON and passed to PARMELA. The magnetic field 

for the air core solenoid around the first accelerating section was modeled in PARMELA 

using single coils each with appropriate strength to represent the field. 

 

6 

Using  only  the  gun,  solenoid,  and  the  immediately  following  drift  space  (i.e.,  no 

booster),  the  first  emittance  minimum  after  the  solenoid  was  optimized  by  varying  the 

solenoidal field and the beam radius at the cathode. A value of Bz = 3.15 kG and hard-

edge  radius  of  1  mm  was  found  to  be  optimum.  The  emittance  minimum  very  nearly 

coincides with the “new working point.” A slightly larger value of BZ is found here than 

with  HOMDYN,  consistent  with  the  solenoid  being  displaced  somewhat  downstream 

because of the physical interference of the gun structure. 

Next  the  position  of  the  booster  with  an  accelerating  gradient  of  25  MV/m  was 

optimized  followed  by  the  position  and  field  of  the  linac  solenoid.  The  injector 

parameters determined in this manner are summarized in Table 1. A thermal emittance of 

0.26 µm has been added to the PARMELA deck. 

For the parameters of Table 1, the emittance and beam size for a risetime of 0.5 ps is 

shown  in  Fig.  3  as  a  function  of  distance  from  the  cathode.  The  normalized  transverse 

phase space at the exit of the booster for 100K particles is shown in Fig. 4. The upper left 

plot is a normalized x-y scatter plot, with xn and yn amplitudes in units of rms beam size. 

The normalized  xn − ′ x n  phase space is shown in the upper right with the  rms emittance 

ellipse  given  by  the  circle  of  unity  radius  in  the  center.  The  density  of  particles  in  the 

center of the beam is not evident in these plots. The normalized rms slice emittance in x 

and  y,  as  a  function  of  axial  distance  along  the  bunch,  is  shown  in  the  lower  left.  The 

projected  value  is  shown  by  the  horizontal  line.  On  the  lower  right,  the  beta-mismatch 

amplitude,  ζ,  is    shown  as  a  function  of  ∆z.  The  beta-mismatch  amplitude,  which  is 

normalized  such  that  ζ(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:4) (cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:4) (cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:4) (cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:4) (cid:18)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:18)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:8)(cid:13)(cid:4) (cid:19)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:20)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:6)(cid:4) (cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:4) (cid:12)(cid:21)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:11)(cid:4) (cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:4)

parameters and the projected Twiss parameters. Transporting the beam through a follow-

on accelerating channel may be difficult if the variation in ζ is large [15]. 

The  same  PARMELA  simulations  yield  an  integrated  (slice)  energy  spread  at  the 

booster  exit  that  is  within  0.1  (0.005)%.  However,  initial  results  of  an  ongoing 

comparison of PARMELA with PIC code simulations near the photocathode indicate that 

the energy spread predicted by PARMELA may be overly optimistic [16]. 

5. Conclusions 
 

An  rf    photoinjector  for the  LCLS  based  on  the  “new  working  point”  configuration 

has  been  described.  The  injector  will  utilize  a  1.6-cell  rf  gun  designed  for  120  Hz  and 

equipped with a Cu photocathode and load-lock. The cathode is illuminated with 500 µJ 

of uv light provided by a tripled-Ti:sapphire laser. At the output of the injector, the 150 

MeV beam has a transverse emittance that is well below the 1-µm requirement and the 

slice emittance is about 25% (relative) lower except for the head and tail. The integrated 

(slice) energy spread is also very low.

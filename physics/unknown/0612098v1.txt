Abstract: We predict theoretically that surface of an optical lattice imprinted 
in defocusing nonlinear media can support shock, or kink waves. Such new 
surface waves contain a modulationally stable pedestal and are strongly loca-
lized at the edge of the optical lattice due to Bragg-type reflection. The kink 
steepness and localization degree can be controlled by the lattice depth. We 
found two types of kinks, which exhibit distinct stability properties for each 
finite gap in the lattice spectrum. Our findings open the way to experimental 
o
bservation of optical surface kink waves.

Kinks are very specific type of nonlinear waves. They resemble shock waves having different 
amplitude asymptotes far from the wave center where they exhibit a sharp transition region. In 
fluid  mechanics  and  in  gas  dynamics  shock  waves  typically  occur  when  the  velocity  of  the 
nonlinear excitation depends on its amplitude. Different types of shock waves were encounte-
red in plasma physics and in solid-state physics [1,2]. 

Kinks may form with light [3,4] and this process is accompanied by remarkable nonlinear 
spectral broadening associated to the sharp wavefront. A tendency to sharp wavefront forma-
tion (or self-steepening) in time domain is common for the high-intensity short light pulses in 
nonlinear fibers with normal group-velocity dispersion [5] or in optical capillaries filled with 
organic liquids with delayed nonlinear response [6]. The inertial Raman response and higher-
order  group  velocity  dispersion  also  lead  to  self-steepening  [7].  However,  in  these  settings 
shock waves exist only as transient objects because of lack of broadband phase matching of 
wave’s spectral components required for existence of stationary solutions. 

The space domain offers richer possibilities for stationary shock wave formation, due to 
the  possibility  to  control  the diffraction  properties  of beams  (i.e.,  phasing of spatial  spectral 
components) in fabricated [8] or optically-induced [9] periodic lattices. Photorefractive mate-
rials are excellent candidates for experiments with spatial shock waves since they offer tunabi-
lity of nonlinear response and might be used for lattice induction [10-13]. Bulk photorefrac-
tive crystals with local drift and nonlocal diffusion nonlinearities allow formation of steady-
state shock waves, which, however, contain modulationally unstable pedestals [14]. Another 
mechanism  of  shock  waves  formation  based  on  two-wave  mixing  was  explored  in  [15,16]. 
Extended soliton trains in lattices with saturable [17] or quadratic [18] nonlinearity may also 
be viewed as kinks. 

Recently, the concept of surface waves existing at the interface of periodic and uniform 
medium was suggested [19]. Due to shallow refractive index modulations in periodic medium 
that can be created with currently available technologies surface waves at lattice interfaces can 
be  observed  at  achievable  power  levels  [20],  in  contrast  to  nonlinear  surface  waves  at  the 
interfaces of natural materials [21-23]. Lattice interfaces support localized gap surface solitons 
[24-26]. Still open and challenging problem is the existence and stability of surface kinks at 

 

 

the interface of a bulk medium and an optical lattice. In this paper we introduce such surface 
shock  waves,  consisting  of  the  constant  stable  pedestal  located  in  a  uniform  self-defocusing 
medium and of spatially fading amplitude oscillations inside the lattice. These are proper kink 
waves, i.e., waves featuring a transition between regions with nonzero and zero light intensi-
ties,  that  do  not  exist  at  interfaces  of  two  uniform  materials  with  different  linear  refractive 
indices and equal nonlinear coefficients. They can only exist when both linear and nonlinear 
properties of two uniform materials are different [27,28] or in suitable nonlinear waveguides 
[29], under conditions not easy to meet in practice. In contrast, here we address surface kinks 
in a single nonlinear material. The steepness of surface lattice kinks, their internal structure, 
and penetration depth into periodic structure can be controlled by varying the lattice depth and 
its period. We found two types of surface shock waves featuring distinct stability properties: 
an  unstable  branch  that  transforms  into  the  family  of  known  localized  gap  solitons,  and  the 
important  branch  of  stable  kink  waves,  which  can  not  be  asymptotically  derived  from  any 
family  of  localized  solitons  found  before,  and  that  thus  provides  an  experimentally  feasible 
setting for the observation of kink surface waves at moderate power levels in contrast to all 
kinks discussed earlier. 

We  thus  address  the  propagation  of  a  laser  beam  at  the  edge  of  a  semi-infinite  lattice 
imprinted  in  a  defocusing  cubic  Kerr-type  medium,  described  by  the  nonlinear  Schrödinger 
equation for the dimensionless complex amplitude of the light field q :

index  modulation,  with  Ω  being  the  frequency  of  modulation.  The  material  nonlinearity  is 
uniform in the medium. The presence of the lattice results in an increase of the mean effective 
refractive index in the region 
. We assume that the depth of the linear refractive index 
modulation is small compared with the unperturbed index and is of the order of contribution 
arising via the defocusing nonlinearity. Such interfaces can be realized, e.g., in AlGaAs [30] 
or LiNbO [31], by etching of periodic structure on top of a suitable substrate. The technique of 
optical induction [10-13], combined with erasing parts of the red-light-imprinted lattice with 
an  intense  green  background  illumination,  may  provide  an  alternative  tool  for  realization  of 
interfaces considered here. In both cases one can achieve sufficiently sharp transition between 
the  lattice  and  the  uniform  medium.  Here  we  concentrate  on  the  case  of  defocusing  media 
where modulational instabilities are suppressed. Based on the scaling properties of Eq. (1) that 
can be used to obtain different families of solutions, here we set

.  For  each  lattice  depth  all 
possible  propagation  constants  of  the  linear  Bloch  modes  are  joined  into  bands  (Fig.  1(a)), 
where no localized solutions exist even in the nonlinear regime. Localized solitons emerge as 
nonlinear defect modes in the gaps of Floquet-Bloch spectrum. Such requirement also holds 
for  any  type  of  nonlinear  wave  supported  by  the  lattice  interface,  which  exhibits  vanishing 
tails inside the lattice. Notice that Floquet-Bloch spectrum possesses a single semi-infinite gap 
and infinite number of finite gaps. Because of the defocusing nonlinearity, only finite gaps can 
give rise to soliton solutions.

moderate  intensity  levels  that  are  of  the  same  order  as  intensities  required for  lattice  soliton 
formation.

We found two different types of kink surface waves originating from each finite gap of 
the lattice spectrum. For concreteness, here we are interested only in solitons whose primary 
maxima are located in the nearest-to-interface lattice channel. The primary maximum of “in-
phase”  kinks  is  in-phase  with  the  constant  pedestal  (Figs.  2(d)  and  2(e)),  while  it  is  out-of-
phase with pedestal for the “out-of-phase” kinks depicted in Figs. 2(a)-2(c). Consequently, the

intensity  of  out-of-phase  solutions  inside  the  lattice  does  not  exceed  the  limiting  value 
while  for  in-phase  waves  the  maximum  of  intensity  is  achieved  in  the  first  lattice  channel. 
Importantly,  the  central point  of  the wavefront resides  in the  first  lattice  channel for out-of-
phase kinks while it resides in the second channel for in-phase waves.

The constraint 

 together with the structure of band-gap lattice spectrum determines 
the  domains  of  existence  for  kink  surface  waves.  The  difference  in  internal  structure  of  in-
phase  and  out-of-phase  waves  manifests  itself  in  different  domains  of  existence  (compare 
shaded regions in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)). Notice that the domain of existence of kinks does not

The domain of existence of in-phase shock wave first expands with decrease of  p  down 
 (notice  that  this  value  exactly  coincides  with  critical  lattice  depth  for  existence  of 
to 
localized  surface  gap  solitons  [24]),  but  then  gets  narrower  and  shrinks  at  p
 (Fig.

waves. The key difference between these two types of waves is that for 
 and at 
b
 the in-phase wave transforms into fully localized surface gap soliton, and can 
be viewed as a continuation of family of gap surface solitons in the region 
, in contrast 
to the entirely new family of out-of-phase waves that can not be asymptotically derived from 
any localized gap surface soliton family found earlier, because such solitons do not transform

A similar picture was encountered for all finite gaps of the lattice spectrum, i.e. each gap 
gives rise to two types of shock waves. An example of out-of-phase shock wave originating 
from the second finite gap is shown in Fig. 2(f). The domain of existence of such solutions in 
terms of lattice depth 

 increases with growing number of the gap.

. In defocusing media 
the constant pedestal is stable, so that the only type of instability that may develop is an oscil-
latory  instability  typical  for  gap  solitons.  We  found  that  out-of-phase  waves  are  completely 
stable in a substantial part of their existence domain. They are stable everywhere, except for a 
narrow region near the lower cutoff where oscillatory instability may take place. Such waves 
keep  their  input  structure  on  propagation  over  indefinitely  long  distances  in  the  presence  of 
considerable input noise (Fig. 3(a)). At the same time in-phase waves were found to be always 
unstable.  The  oscillatory  instabilities  of  such  waves  develop  mainly  on  their  tails  inside  the 
lattice and typically are so weak that waves can propagate without any appreciable distortion 
over  hundreds  of  diffraction  lengths  (Fig.  3(b)).  Surprisingly,  out-of-phase  wave  originating 
from the second gap (Fig. 2(e)) can also be stable despite the fact that gap soliton with similar 
symmetry in infinite lattice typically undergo strong exponential instability. 

In summary, we predicted the existence of kink or shock surface waves at the interface of 
optical lattices imprinted in defocusing nonlinear media. To the best of our knowledge, such 
waves provide the first known example of completely stable surface kink waves in optics. In 
addition, our findings open the way to the first experimental observation of surface kinks, a 
goal not yet achieved to date because of lack of suitable physical setting. The kinks predicted 
 waveguide arrays exhibiting required defocusing photo-
here can be excited, e.g., in

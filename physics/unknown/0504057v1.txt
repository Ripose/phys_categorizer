This  paper  is  devoted  to  the  theoretical  and  experimental  demonstration  of  the 

possibility to perform time-resolved diffusing wave spectroscopy: we successfully registered 

field fluctuations for selected photon path lengths that can overpass 300 transport mean free 

paths. Such a performance opens new possibilities for biomedical optics applications.

Biological  tissues  present  a  transmission  windows  in  the  near  infrared  range.  For 

wavelengths near 800nm, light can travel deep inside the tissue and reveal a lot of pertinent 

information  for  medical  diagnosis:  this  is  the  base  of  Near  InfraRed  Spectroscopy  (NIRS), 

which, for example, allows an estimation of tissue oxygenation from absorption coefficients 

measurements[1]. Very interesting complementary information on the microscopic movements 

of  the  scatterers,  such  as  the  translation  movement  of  the  red  blood  cells,  can  also  be 

obtained[2-6]  from  the  correlation  of  the  scattered  field  fluctuations  in  the  frame  of  the  so-

called Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS)[7-10].  

NIRS  however  suffers  from  information  blurring  due  to  scattering.  The  use  of  time-

resolved  detection  has  been  proved  to  be  an  efficient  tool  to  obtain  more  information 

concerning  the  tissue:  it  allows  a  separate  measurement  of  the  absorption  and  the  reduced 

scattering coefficients, it is helpful in the measurement of the optical coefficients in a layered 

medium[11-14]  and,  concerning  mammography,  it  can  increase  spatial  resolution  in  trans-

illumination[15,16].  However,  even  if  a  lot  of  improvements  have  been  observed,  setups  that 

perform time-resolved detection are usually expensive and require complex technologies. 

 

In  previous  papers  we  proposed[17-19]  a  new  way  to  perform  time-resolved 

measurements  of  the  light  scattered  by  a  tissue.  In  addition  to  its  lower  cost,  this  method, 

based on the use of an interferometer and a wavelength modulated source, provides the great 

advantage  of  allowing  time-resolved  DWS.  This  possibility  to  study  the  correlation  of  the 

field fluctuations for a selected photon path length is very interesting and it has been shown, 

for acoustic waves, that it can considerably simplify the analysis of the correlation signal[20]. 

Such measurements were already performed in the past for photon paths that do not exceed 20 

transport mean free paths[21]. In this paper we report the first results obtained for photon paths 

over  300  transport  mean  free  paths,  opening  the  possibility  to  perform  measurements  with 

several centimeters source-detector distances.

The  principle  of  our  method  is  the  following  (see  the  experimental  set-up  in  fig  1): 

interferences between the back-scattered light and a reference beam are recorded. As we use a 

monochromatic laser source, there is no difficulty to record the resultant speckle pattern. The 

trick  of  this  method  is  to  induce  a  wavelength  modulation  of  the  laser  source  in  order  to 

simulate an incoherent source. To avoid problems with the modulation system bandwidth we 

use  a  sinusoidal  modulation,  and  the  radian  frequency  is 

=
ωω

.  The 

recorded interference signal can then be written, after rejection of the DC components:

where s0 is the complex amplitude of the reference field, and where 

[

 corresponds to 

the complex amplitude of the scattered field. This equation  infers of course that both fields 

are detected in the same mode, as it would be the case, for instance, if they are detected far 

from the source, or through a monomode fiber. 

We  have  demonstrated  in  a  previous  paper[17]  that  s

~   can  be  directly  linked  to  the  complex 

amplitude of the time resolved scattered field 

s(τ,t  of a virtual pulsed experiment, where τ is

(2) 

The only requirement is that the spectrum of the virtual pulsed source does not significantly 

vary  on  the  scale  of  the  wavelength  modulation.  One  should  note  in  (2)  the  use  of  two 

timescales: t , in the millisecond range, is the timescale of the registered signal and is related 

to the fluctuations of the scattered field, while τ corresponds to the photons time of flight, and 

3

is in the hundreds picosecond range. We consider that these timescales are not correlated. We 

stress here that our notations are somewhat different from usual notations in DWS[7-10], where 

the photon time of flight is not directly introduced.  

In our experiment, the signal s(t) is multiplied by the numerically generated function[17]:

As the photon transit time τ is of the order of  hundreds of picoseconds, Ω is in the 

tens gigahertz range, and is negligible compared to the radian frequency ω of the light source. 

Furthermore we make the basic assumption[17] that the optical coefficients do not significantly 

vary  with  the  source  wavelength,  and  we  consequently  omit  the  wavelength  dependence  of 

the light speed c and of the energy transmission coefficient  κT . The average of the Doppler 

shift term in (6) can be separated for the paths distribution[7] if we are considering paths with 

a given scattering number n:

where  we  recall  that

We  can  now  insert  (8)  in  (5)  in  order  to  derive  an  expression  that  allows  a  quantitative 

analysis of the influence of the correlation function on the time resolution of our setup. The 

wavelength modulation frequency must indeed be high enough in order to freeze the speckle 

pattern  fluctuations  during  half  a  modulation  period.  We  have  already  shown[18]  that  a

wavelength  modulation  frequency  of  300Hz  is  high  enough  to  work  with  viscous  fluids  or 

with  some  biological  tissues.  We  will  therefore  make  the  additional  assumption  that  the 

correlation function is almost constant during half a modulation period and

The time resolution of our setup is therefore determined by the modulation depth ∆Ω of the 

wavelength scan: a peak to peak frequency modulation of 30GHz thus corresponds to a 45ps 

time  resolution  [17,18],  which  is  reasonably  small  compared  to  the  typical  times  of  flight  we 

will observe. One should furthermore note that, for τ > 0, the term Π(τ+τ’) can be neglected 

in (10), and we have approximately:

:  we  find  the  time-resolved  average  intensity,  as 

previously shown[17,18]. The very new point is that the ratio Ip/I0 is directly related to the time-

(12) 

This  simply  comes  from  the  fact  that  the  contributions  of  the  different  scattering 

events  to  the  Doppler  shift  are  independent.  Thanks  to  time-resolution,  the  effective 

 

 

 

written:

f

standard  DWS,  where  a  more  complex  inverse  problem  must  be  performed,  taking  into 

account boundary conditions and other optical coefficients.  

It  is  well  known[10]  that 

µ   is  directly  linked  to  the  microscopic  movements  in  the

We  are  now  going  to  show  that  our  method  can  be  used  experimentally  in  the 

diffusion regime  to perform time-resolved measurements of the correlation function since we 

can  restrict  the  measurement  to  a  selected  length  of  the  photon  path.  Moreover,  with  our 

setup,  these  selected  photon  path  lengths  can  exceed  several  hundreds  transport  mean  free 

paths. 

 

 

 

Our experimental setup was described in a previous paper  [18] and is shown in fig. 1. 

Let us recall its main features: The wavelength modulated source is a Littman extended cavity 

laser diode (TEC-500-780-30) emitting 7mW at λ=780nm, with a line width of about 1 MHz. 

This  source  allows  a  modehop  free  modulation  of  the  laser  frequency  of  about  30GHz  at  a 

modulation  frequency 

f

300

Hz

.  In  order  to  cancel  parasitic  signals  from  the  reference 

=

beam we use an optical isolator, a low reference signal (1µW in the following), and a balanced 

detection.  An  acousto-optic  modulator  (AOM  in  fig.  1),  placed  in  the  signal  arm,  plays  the 

role of an optical shutter in order to perform a real-time background subtraction: the signal is 

8

acquired  during  one  modulation  period,  and  the  background  is  measured  during  the  next 

period  when  the  shutter  is  closed.  The  periodicity  of  the  acquisition  process  therefore 

corresponds to two modulation periods. Graded-index multimode fibers where used for both 

the signal and the reference arms.  

 

Concerning  the  sample,  we  used  a  phantom  made  with  calibrated  polystyrene 

microspheres  (diameter  520 ± 37  nm,  refractive  index  1.580  at  780nm)  in  suspension  in  a 

viscous  liquid  in  order  to  freeze  the  field  fluctuations  in  the  scale  of  the  modulation  period 

presently  used  (we  estimate  that  a  modulation  frequency  f  =  10kHz  is  needed  for  water). 

Since  polystyrene  microspheres  are  usually  prepared  in  water  suspensions,  we  used 

suspensions  in  glycerol  which  is  miscible  with  water.  Glycerol  has  a  very  weak  absorption 

coefficient  in  the  near  infrared  range[24].  Its  viscosity  η    is  high  and  depends  on  both 

temperature and water concentration[25]. The refractive index of pure glycerol is n=1.472, and 

depends  also  on  water  concentration[26].  In  the  experiment  considered  in  this  paper,  the 

reduced  scattering  coefficient  was  set  to  µ’s  =  17.5cm-1,  which  corresponds  to  a  water 

concentration  of  7.6%,  a  refractive  index  of  1.461  and  a  viscosity  η  =275±10mPa.s  at 

22.5±0.5°C. 

The  measurements  were  performed  with  a  reflectance  geometry.  The  emission  and 

detection fibers are perpendicular to the sample surface, just in contact with the liquid, with a 

source-detector separation r=1cm. A black optical shield is placed between the tips of these 

fibers  in  order  to  avoid  cross-talking.  The  ensemble  averaging  was  performed  over  90  000 

modulation  periods.  The  reduced  scattering  coefficient  of  the  sample  was  experimentally 

checked    from  the  time-resolved  reflectance  function  measured  by  our  system  and  fitted  by 

Monte  Carlo  simulations[27]:  we  obtained  µ’s  =  17.6±0.5cm-1,  in  good  accordance  with  the 

awaited value. 

 

 

9

We have calculated the ratio Ip/I0 for different p values . In fact, as the periodicity of 

the acquisition procedure corresponds to 2 modulation periods, that is to 4 times T/2, we set 

p=4p’. Fig. 2 presents the results obtained for p’ varying from 1 to 5. For p’=1 a signal has 

been obtained up to τ=1000ps, which corresponds to more than 350 transport mean free paths, 

and to about 2000 scattering events. As predicted, the ln(Ip/I0) curves exhibit a linear behavior 

with  the  photons  time  of  flight  τ.  The  values  of  the  effective  absorption  coefficient  µf(tp’) 

obtained from the linear curves fits (thin curves in fig.2) are plotted in fig. 3 as a function of

 and we obtain a value of the characteristic diffusion time t0 = 

2.3±0.1 s, to be compared with the awaited value at 22.5°C: t0 = 2.4±0.2 s.  

In  conclusion,  we  have  reported  the  first  experimental  evidence  for  time-resolved 

diffusing wave spectroscopy with photon path lengths that overpass 300 transport mean free 

paths. Such measurements can simplify the analysis of correlation measurements. The major 

advantage  of  this  method  is  the  possibility  to  get  all  benefits  of  time  resolution  for  sensing 

deep  layers  in  biological  tissue,  or  for  improving  depth  resolution  in  transillumination.  The 

next step will be to increase the modulation frequency (up to 10kHz[28]) in order to work with 

biological media.

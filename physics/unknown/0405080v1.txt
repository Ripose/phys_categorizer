Abstract 

The  spatial  distribution  of  DNA  base  sequence  A,  C,  G  and  T  exhibit  selfsimilar 
fractal fluctuations and the corresponding power spectra follow inverse power law 
of the form 1/fa  where f is  the frequency  and  a the exponent. Inverse power  law 
form for power spectra implies the following: (1) A scale invariant eddy continuum, 
namely, the amplitudes of component eddies are related to each other by a scale 
factor alone. In general, the scale factor is different for different scale ranges and 
indicates a multifractal structure for the spatial distribution of DNA base sequence. 
(2)  Scale  invariance  of  eddies  also  implies  long-range  spatial  correlations  of  the 
eddy  fluctuations.  Multifractal  structure  to  space-time  fluctuations  and  the 
associated  inverse  power  law  form  for  power  spectra  is  generic  to  spatially 
extended  dynamical  systems  in  nature  and  is  a  signature  of  self-organized 
criticality.  Mathematical  models  for  the  simulation  and  prediction  of  fractal 
fluctuations  of  dynamical  systems  are  nonlinear  and  do  not  have  analytical 
solutions.  Finite  precision  computer  realizations  of  non-linear  mathematical 
models  of  dynamical  systems  also  exhibit  self-organized  criticality  manifested  as 
sensitive  dependence  on  initial  conditions  and  give  chaotic  solutions  resulting  in 
‘deterministic  chaos’.  The  exact  physical  mechanism  for  the  observed  self-
organized  criticality  is  not  yet  identified.  The  author  has  developed  a  general 
systems  theory  where  quantum  mechanical  laws  emerge  as  self-consistent 
explanations  for  the  observed  long-range  space-time  correlations  in  macro-scale 
dynamical systems, i.e., the apparently chaotic fractal fluctuations are signatures 
of  quantum-like  chaos  in  dynamical  systems.  The  model  also  provides  unique 
quantification for the observed inverse power law form for power spectra in terms 
of  the  statistical  normal  distribution.  In  this  paper  it  is  shown  that  the  frequency 
distribution  of  the  bases  C+G  in  all  available  contiguous  sequences  for  Human 
chromosome Y DNA exhibit model predicted quantum-like chaos.

generic  to  spatially  extended  dynamical  systems  in  nature  and  are 
identified as signatures of self-organized criticality. A representative 
example  is  the  selfsimilar  fractal  geometry  of  His-Purkinje  system 
whose electrical impulses govern the interbeat interval of the heart. 
The  spectrum  of  interbeat  intervals  exhibits  a  broadband  inverse 
power law form fa where f is the frequency and a the exponent. Self-
organized criticality implies non-local connections in space and time, 
i.e.,  long-term  memory  of  short-term  spatial  fluctuations  in  the 
extended  dynamical  system 
that  acts  as  a  unified  whole 
communicating network.

Finite  precision 

realizations  of  nonlinear 
mathematical  models  of  real  world  dynamical  systems  also  exhibit 
self-organized  criticality  manifested  as  sensitive  dependence  on 
initial  conditions  and  identified  as  deterministic  chaos.  The  author 
has developed a general systems theory that predicts the observed 
self-organized criticality in model and real world dynamical systems 
as  intrinsic  to  quantumlike  chaos  governing  the  pattern evolution in 
space  and  time.  A  summary  of  the  model  is  presented  with 
applications to biological systems. 

‘Nonlinear  dynamics  and  chaos’,  a  multidisciplinary  area  of 
intensive research in recent years (since 1980s) has helped identify 
universal  characteristics  of  spatial  patterns  (forms)  and  temporal 
fluctuations  (functions)  of  disparate  dynamical  systems  in  nature. 
Examples  of  dynamical  systems,  i.e.,  systems  which  change  with 
time  include  biological  (living)  neural  networks  of  the  human  brain 
which responds as a unified whole to a multitude of input signals and 
the  non-biological  (non-living)  atmospheric  flow  structure  which 
exhibits  teleconnections,  i.e.,  long-range  space-time  correlations. 
Spatially  extended  dynamical  systems  in  nature  exhibit  selfsimilar 
fractal  geometry  to  the  spatial  pattern.  The  sub-units  of  selfsimilar 
structures  resemble  the  whole  in  shape.  The  name  ‘fractal’  coined 
by Mandelbrot (1977) indicates non-Euclidean or fractured (broken) 
Euclidean structures. Traditional Euclidean geometry discusses only 
three-,  two-  and  one-dimensional  objects,  representative  examples 
being  sphere,  rectangle  and  straight  line  respectively.  Objects  in 
nature  have  irregular  non-Euclidean  shapes,  now  identified  as 
fractals  and  the  fractal  dimension  D  is  given  as  D=dlogM/dlogR, 
where  M  is  the  mass  contained  within  a  distance  R  from  a  point 
within the extended object. A constant value for D indicates uniform 
stretching on logarithmic scale. Objects in nature, in general exhibit 
multifractal structure, i.e., the fractal dimension D varies with length 
scale  R.  The  fractal  structure  of  physiological  systems  has  been 
identified  (Goldberger  et  al.,  1990,  2002;  West,  1990,  2004).  The 
global  atmospheric  cloud  cover  pattern  also  exhibits  selfsimilar 
fractal geometry (Lovejoy and Schertzer, 1986). Selfsimilarity implies 
long-range  spatial  correlations,  i.e.,  the  larger  scale  is  a  magnified 
version  of  the  smaller  scale  with  enhancement  of  fine  structure. 
Selfsimilar  fractal  structures  in  nature  support  functions,  which 
fluctuate  on  all  scales  of  time.  For  example,  the  neural  network  of

architecture to the spatial pattern enables integration of a multitude 
of  signals  of  all  space-time  scales  so  that  the  dynamical  system 
responds  as  a  unified  whole  to  local  stimuli,  i.e.,  short  term 
fluctuations are carried as internal structure to long-term fluctuations. 
Fractal  networks  therefore  function  as  dynamic  memory  storage 
devices,  which  integrate  short-term  fluctuations  into  long-period 
fluctuations.  The  irregular  (nonlinear)  variations  of  fluctuations  in 
dynamical systems are therefore broadband because of coexistence 
of  fluctuations  of  all  scales.  Power  spectral  analysis  (MacDonald, 
1989) 
the  periodicities 
(frequencies) and their amplitudes in time series data of fluctuations. 
The  power  spectrum  is  plotted  on  log-log  scale  as  the  intensity 
represented  by  variance  (amplitude  squared)  versus  the  period 
(frequency)  of  the  component  periodicities.  Dynamical  systems  in 
nature exhibit  inverse  power  law  form  1/fa  where  f  is  the frequency 
(1/period)  and  a  the  exponent  for  the  power  spectra  of  space-time 
fluctuations  indicating  selfsimilar  fluctuations  on  all  space-time 
scales,  i.e.,  long-range  space-time  correlations.  The  amplitudes  of 
short-term and long-term are related by a scale factor alone, i.e., the 
space-time fluctuations exhibit scale invariance or long-range space-
time  correlations,  which  are  independent  of  the  exact  details  of 
dynamical  mechanisms  underlying  the  fluctuations  at  different 
scales. The universal characteristics of spatially extended dynamical 
systems,  namely,  the  fractal  structure  to  the  space-time  fluctuation 
pattern and inverse power law form for power spectra of space-time 
fluctuations  are  identified  as  signatures  of  self-organized  criticality 
implies  non-local

Surprisingly,  such  long-range  space-time  correlations  had 
been  earlier  identified  (Gleick,  1987)  as  sensitive  dependence  on 
initial conditions of finite precision computer realizations of nonlinear 
mathematical  models  of  dynamical  systems  and  named 
‘deterministic chaos’. Deterministic chaos is therefore a signature of 
self-organized criticality in computed model solutions.

It  has  not  been  possible  to  identify  the  exact  mechanism 
underlying 
space-time 
correlations in natural dynamical systems and in computed solutions 
of model dynamical systems. The physical mechanisms responsible 
for  self-organized  criticality  should  be  independent  of  the  exact 
details  (physical,  chemical,  physiological,  biological,  computational 
system  etc.)  of  the  dynamical  system  so  as  to  be  universally 
applicable to all dynamical systems (real and model).

et  al.  (1993).  Standard  models  for  atmospheric  flow  dynamics 
cannot explain the observed self-organized criticality in atmospheric 
flows  satisfactorily.  The  author  has  developed  a  general  systems 
theory for atmospheric flows (Selvam, 1990; Selvam and Fadnavis, 
1998  and  all  references  therein)  that  predicts  the  observed  self-
organized criticality as intrinsic to quantumlike chaos governing flow 
dynamics. The model concepts have also been applied to show that 
deterministic  chaos  in  computed  solutions  of  model  dynamical 
systems is a direct consequence of roundoff error in finite precision 
iterative  computations  (Selvam,  1993)  incorporated  in  long-term 
numerical integration schemes used for numerical solutions. 

In  the  following  Section  2,  the  model  for  self-organized 
criticality  in  atmospheric  flows  is  first  summarized  and  model 
concepts  are  shown  to  be  applicable  to  all  real  world  and  model 
dynamical  systems.  The  concept  of  self-organized  criticality  and 
quantumlike  chaos  in  biological  and  physiological  systems  in 
particular are discussed. 

2. General systems theory concepts 

In summary (Selvam, 1990; Selvam and Fadnavis, 1998), the model 
is based on Townsend’s concept (Townsend, 1956) that large eddy 
structures form in turbulent flows as envelopes of enclosed turbulent 
eddies.  Such  a  simple  concept  that  space-time  averaging  of  small-
scale  structures  gives  rise  to  large-scale  space-time  fluctuations 
leads to the following important model predictions. 

2.1 Quantumlike chaos in turbulent fluid flows 

Since  the  large  eddy  is  but  the  integrated  mean  of  enclosed 
turbulent  eddies,  the  eddy  energy  (kinetic)  distribution  follows 
statistical normal distribution according to the Central Limit Theorem 
(Ruhla,  1992).  Such  a  result,  that  the  additive  amplitudes  of  the 
eddies, when squared, represent probability distributions is found in 
the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems such as the electron or 
photon. Atmospheric flows, or, in general turbulent fluid flows follow 
quantumlike chaos. 

2.2 Dynamic memory (information) circulation network 

The root mean square (r.m.s.) circulation speeds W and w* of large 
and turbulent eddies of respective radii R and r are related as

Eq.(1) is a statement of the law of conservation of energy for 
eddy growth in fluid flows and implies a two-way ordered energy flow 
between 
larger  and  smaller  scales.  Microscopic  scale 
perturbations  are  carried  permanently  as  internal  circulations  of 
progressively  larger  eddies.  Fluid  flows  therefore  act  as  dynamic 
memory  circulation  networks  with  intrinsic  long-term  memory  of 

the

short-term  fluctuations.  Such  “memory  of  water”  is  reported  by 
Davenas et al. (1988). 

2.3 Quasicrystalline structure 

The flow structure consists of an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory 
with  Fibonacci  winding  number  and  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling 
pattern  for  internal  structure  (Fig.1).  Primary  perturbation  ORO 
(Fig.1) of time period T generates return circulation OR1RO which, in 
turn,  generates  successively  larger  circulations  OR1R2,  OR2R3, 
OR3R4,  OR4R5,  etc.,  such  that  the  successive  radii  form  the 
Fibonacci  mathematical  number  series,  i.e.,  OR1/ORO=  OR2/OR1  = 
…….=  t  where  t  is  the  golden  mean  equal  to  (1+(cid:1)5)/2(cid:2)1.618.  The 
flow  structure  therefore  consists  of  a  nested  continuum  of  vortices, 
i.e., vortices within vortices.

The  quasiperiodic  Penrose 

five-fold 
symmetry  has  been  identified  as  quasicrystalline  structure  in 
condensed matter physics (Janssen, 1988). The self-organized large 
eddy  growth  dynamics,  therefore,  spontaneously  generates  an 
internal  structure  with  the  five-fold  symmetry  of  the  dodecahedron, 
which is referred to as the icosahedral symmetry, e.g., the geodesic 
dome  devised  by  Buckminster  Fuller.  Incidentally,  the  pentagonal 
dodecahedron is, after the helix, nature’s second favourite structure 
(Stevens, 1974). Recently the carbon macromolecule C60, formed by 
condensation  from  a  carbon  vapour  jet,  was  found  to  exhibit  the 
icosahedral symmetry of the closed soccer ball and has been named 
Buckminsterfullerene  or  footballene  (Curl  and  Smalley,  1991).  Self-
organized  quasicrystalline  pattern  formation  therefore  exists  at  the 
molecular  level  also  and  may  result  in  condensation  of  specific 
in  biological  media.  Logarithmic  spiral

formation  with  Fibonacci  winding  number  and  five-fold  symmetry 
possess  maximum  packing  efficiency  for  component  parts  and  are 
manifested  strikingly  in  Phyllotaxis  (Jean,  1992a,b;  1994)  and  is 
common to nature (Stevens, 1974; Tarasov, 1986). 

Model  predicted  spiral  flow  structure  is  seen  vividly  in  the 
hurricane  cloud  cover  pattern.  Spiral  waves  are  observed  in  many 
dynamical  systems.  Examples 
include  Belousov-Zhabotinksy 
chemical  reaction  and  also  in  the  electrical  activity  of  heart 
(Steinbock et al., 1993).

The  dominant  quasi-periodicities  are  equal  to  2.2T,  3.6T, 
5.8T,  9.5T,  ……for  values  of  n  =  -1,  0,  1,  2,…,  respectively  (Eq.2). 
Space-time  integration  of  turbulent  fluctuations  results  in  robust 
broadband dominant periodicities which are functions of the primary 
perturbation  time  period  T  alone  and  are  independent  of  exact 
details  (chemical,  electrical,  physical  etc.)  of  turbulent  fluctuations. 
Also,  such  global  scale  oscillations  in  the  unified  network  are  not 
affected  appreciably  by  failure  of  localized  microscale  circulation 
networks. 

Wavelengths  (or  periodicities)  close  to  the  model  predicted 
values  have  been  reported  in  weather  and  climate  variability 
(Selvam  and  Fadnavis,  1998),  prime  number  distribution  (Selvam, 
2001a),  Riemann  zeta  zeros  (non-trivial)  distribution  (Selvam, 
2001b),  Drosophila  DNA  base  sequence  (Selvam,  2002),  stock 
market  economics  (Selvam,  2003),  Human  chromosome  1  DNA 
base sequence (Selvam, 2004). 

Similar  unified  communication  networks  may  be  involved  in 
biological  and  physiological  systems  such  as  the  brain  and  heart, 
which  continue  to  perform  overall  functions  satisfactorily  in  spite  of 
network 
localized 
configurations  increase  insensitivity  to  parameter  changes,  noise 
and minor mutations (Kitano, 2002).

global  atmospheric  weather  patterns  (Burroughs,  1992)  as  the 
quasibiennial oscillation or QBO (2.2 years), the high frequency (3-4 
years) and low frequency (5.8 years) components of the 3-7 years El 
Nino-Southern  Oscillation  (ENSO)  cycle  and  decadic  scale  (>9 
years) fluctuations. The ENSO cycle in particular is characterized by 
devastating  regional  changes  in  global  climate  pattern  (Philander, 
1990) and is now of public concern.

Persistent  periodic  energy  pumping  at  fixed  time  intervals 
(period) T in a fluid medium generates self-sustaining continuum of 
eddies  and  results  in  apparent  nonlinear  chaotic  fluctuations  in  the 
fluid medium. Such chaotic optical (laser) emissions are triggered in 
nonlinear  optical medium using  a  laser  energy  pump  (Harrison  and 
Biswas,  1986).  Self-organized  broadband  structures  may  therefore 
be generated in electromagnetic fields also. 

Macroscale  coherent  structures  emerge  by  space-time 
integration of microscopic domain fluctuations in fluid flows. Such a 
concept  of  the  autonomous  growth  of  atmospheric  eddy  continuum 
with  ordered  energy  flow  between  the  scales  is  analogous  to 
Prigogine’s 
the 
spontaneous  emergence  of  order  and  organization  out  of  apparent 
disorder and chaos through a process of self-organization.

2.4.1 Emergence of order and coherence in biology 

The  problem  of  emergence  of  macroscopic  variables  out  of 
microscopic  dynamics  is  of  crucial  relevance  in  biology  (Vitiello, 
1992).  In  atmospheric  flows  turbulent  fluctuations  self-organize  to 
form  large  eddies  which  give  rise  to  cloud  formations  in  updraft 
regions  where  moisture  condenses.  Similarly,  in  biological  systems 
collective  microscopic  scale  behaviour,  e.g.,  self-organization  of 
local information flow in neural networks may initiate global response 
in  the  human  brain.  Biological  systems  rely  on  a  combination  of 
network  and  the  specific  elements  involved  (Kitano,  2002).  The 
notion that membership in a network could confer stability emerged 
from Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s description of general systems theory 
in  the  1930s  and  Norbert Wieners  description  of  cybernetics  in  the 
1940s. General systems theory focused in part on the notion of flow, 
postulating  the  existence  and  significance  of  flow  equilibria.  In 
contrast 
that  mechanisms  should  yield 
homeostasis,  general  systems  theory  invited  biologists  to  consider 
an  alternative  model  of  homeodynamics  in  which  nonlinear,  non-
equilibrium  processes  could  provide  stability,  if  not  constancy 
(Buchman, 2002).  

to  Cannon’s  concept 

The  cell  dynamical  system  model  for  coherent  pattern 
formation  in  turbulent  flows  summarized  earlier  (Section  2)  may 
provide a general systems theory for biological complexity. General 
systems theory is a logical-mathematical field, the subject matter of 
which is the formulation and deduction of those principles which are 
valid 
their 
in  general,  whatever 
component  elements  or  the  relations  or  ‘forces’  between  them

More  than  25  years  ago  Frohlich  (1968,  1970,  1975,  1980) 
introduced  the  concept  of  cooperative  vibrational  modes  between 
proteins in biological cells. Coherent oscillations in the range of 1010-
1012  Hz  involving  cell  membranes,  DNA  and  cellular  proteins  could 
be  generated  by  interaction  between  vibrating  electric  dipoles 
contained  in  the  proteins  as  a  result  of  nonlinear  properties  of  the

between  all  molecules  constituting  the  system.  Single  molecules 
may  thus  act  in  a  synchronized  fashion  and  can  no  longer  be 
considered as individual. New unexpected features arise from such 
a  dynamic  system,  reacting  as  a  unified  whole  entity  (Insinnia, 
1992).  Coherent  Frohlich  oscillations  may  be  associated  with  the 
dynamical pattern formation of intracellular cytoskeletal architecture 
consisting  of  networks  of  filamentous  protein  polymers,  which 
coordinate  and  integrate  information  flow  in  the  biological  cell 
(Dayhoff et al., 1994; Hameroff et al., 1984, 1986,1989; Hotani et al., 
1992).  Grundler  and Kaiser  (1992),  Kaiser  (1992), Tabony  and  Job 
(1992)  have  also  discussed  biological  autoorganization  and  pattern 
formation in the context of such coherent oscillations. 

2.5 Long-range spatiotemporal correlations (coherence) 

The  logarithmic  spiral  flow  pattern  enclosing  the  vortices  OROR1, 
OR1R2, … may be visualized as a continuous smooth rotation of the 
phase angle (cid:3) (ROOR1, ROOR2, … etc.) with increase in period. The 
phase  angle  (cid:3)  for  each  stage  of  growth  is  equal  to  r/R  and  is 
proportional to the variance W2 (Eq.1), the variance representing the 
intensity of fluctuations. 

The phase angle gives a measure of coherence or correlation 
in  space-time  fluctuations.  The  model  predicted  continuous  smooth 
rotation  of  phase  angle  with  increase  in  period  length  associated 
with  logarithmic  spiral  flow  structure  is  analogous  to  Berry’s  phase 
(Berry, 1988; Kepler et al., 1991) in quantum systems. 

2.6 Universal spectrum of fluctuations 

Conventional power spectral analysis will resolve such a logarithmic 
spiral flow trajectory as a continuum of eddies (broadband spectrum) 
with a progressive increase in phase angle. 

t  equal 

The  power  spectrum,  plotted  on  log-log  scale  as  variance 
versus  frequency  (period)  will  represent  the  probability  density 
to 
to  normalized  standard  deviation 
corresponding 
(logL/logT50) –1 where L is the period in years and T50 is the period 
up to which the cumulative percentage contribution to total variance 
is  equal  to  50.  The  above  expression  for  normalized  standard 
deviation  t  follows  from  model  prediction  of  logarithmic  spiral  flow 
structure  and  model  concept  of  successive  growth  structures  by 
space-time  averaging.  Fluctuations  of  all  scales  therefore  self-
organize  to  form  the  universal  inverse  power  law  form  of  the 
statistical  normal  distribution.  Since  the  phase  angle  (cid:3)  equal  to  r/R 
represents the variance W2 (Section 2.5, Eq.1), the phase spectrum 
plotted  similar  to  variance  spectrum  will  also  follow  the  statistical 
normal distribution.

power  law  form  for  atmospheric  eddy  energy  spectrum  and  also

Penrose  tiling  pattern  for  internal  flow  structure  (Fig.1)  have  been 
identified  in  meteorological  parameters  (Selvam  and  Fadnavis, 
1998). 

2.7 Quantum mechanics for subatomic dynamics: apparent 

paradoxes 

The following apparent paradoxes found in the subatomic dynamics 
of quantum systems (Maddox, 1988) are consistent in the context of 
atmospheric flows as explained in the following. 

2.7.1 Wave-particle duality 

A quantum system behaves as a wave on some occasions and as a 
particle  at  other  times.  Wave-particle  duality  is  consistent  in  the 
context of atmospheric waves, which generate particle-like clouds in 
a row because of formation of clouds in updrafts and dissipation of 
clouds in adjacent downdrafts characterizing wave motion (Fig.2).

quantumlike  mechanics  in  atmospheric  flows.  Particlelike  clouds  form

evaporation  of  condensed  water  in  adjacent  downdrafts  associated 
with  eddy  circulations  in  atmospheric  flows.  Wave-particle  duality  in 
macroscale  real  world  dynamical  systems  may  be  associated  with

2.7.2 Non-local connection 

The  separated  parts  of  a  quantum  system  respond  as  a  unified 
whole  to  local  perturbations.  Non-local  connection  is  implicit  to 
atmospheric  flow  structure  quantified  in  Eq.(1)  as  ordered  two-way 
energy  flow  between  larger  and  smaller  scales  and  seen  as  long-

Atmospheric  flows  self-organize  to  form  a  unified  network  with  the 
quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling  pattern  for  internal  structure  (Fig.1), 
which provide long-range (non-local) space-time connections. 

3. Self-organized criticality and quantum-like chaos in 

computed model dynamical systems 

3.1 Deterministic chaos 

Traditional deterministic mathematical models of dynamical systems 
based on Newtonian continuum dynamics are nonlinear and do not 
have  analytical  solutions.  Finite  precision  computer  realizations  of 
nonlinear  model  dynamical  systems  are  sensitively  dependent  on 
initial  conditions  and  give  chaotic  solutions.  Computed  solutions 

 

11 

therefore  exhibit  ‘deterministic  chaos’  since  deterministic  equations 
give  chaotic  solutions.  Such  deterministic  chaos  was  identified 
nearly  a  century  ago  by  Poincare  (1892)  in  his  study  of  the  three-
body  problem.  Availability  of  computers  with  graphical  display 
facilities  in  late  1950s  facilitated  numerical  solutions  and  in  1963 
Lorenz  (1963)  identified  deterministic  chaos  in  a  simple  model  of 
atmospheric  flows.  Ruelle  and  Takens  (1971)  were  the  first  to 
identify  deterministic  chaos  as  similar  to  turbulence  in  fluid  flows. 
The  computed  trajectory  traces  the  selfsimilar  fractal  pattern  of  the 
‘strange  attractor’  so  named  because  of  its  strange  convoluted 
shape  being  the final destination  of all  possible  trajectories.  ‘Chaos 
Science’  is  now  (since  1980s)  an  area  of  intensive  research  in  all 
branches  of  science  and  other  areas  of  human  interest  (Gleick, 
1987).  The  physics  of  deterministic  chaos  is  not  yet  identified. 
Deterministic  chaos  is  a  direct  consequence  of  numerical  solutions 
of error sensitive dynamical systems such as Xn+1=F(Xn) where Xn+1, 
the value of the variable X at the (n+1)th instant is a function F of Xn. 
Error-feedback loop inherent to such iterative computations magnify 
exponentially  with  time  the  following  errors  inherent  to  numerical 
computations: (1) The continuous dynamical system is computed as 
a discrete dynamical system because of discretization of space and 
time  in  numerical  computations  with  implicit  assumption  of  sub-grid 
scale  homogeneity.  (2)  Binary  computer  arithmetic  precludes  exact 
number  representation  at  the  data  input  stage  itself.  (3)  Model 
approximations  and  assumptions.  (4)  Roundoff  error  of  finite 
precision  computer  arithmetic  magnifies  exponentially  with  time  the 
above  errors  and  gives  chaotic  solutions  in  iterative  computations 
such  as  that  used  in  long-term  numerical  integration  schemes  in 
numerical solutions. 

Sensitive  dependence  on  initial  conditions  of  computed 
solutions  indicates  long-range  space-time  correlations  and  is  a 
signature of self-organized criticality as explained earlier.

may  be  resolved  as  the  product  WR  of  the  number  of  units  of 
computation  W  of  yardstick-length  R  and  wr  represents  the  initial 
uncertainty domain where w is the number of units of computation of 
precision r to begin with. Iterative computations may be visualized as 
spatial  integration  of  enclosed  higher  precision  uncertainty  domain 
wr resulting in the larger uncertainty domain WR. The above concept 
is  similar  to  the  growth  of  large  eddy  structures  from  turbulent 
fluctuations.  The  concepts  of  cell  dynamical  system  model  for 
growth  of  large  eddy  structures  in  turbulent flows  may  therefore  be 
applied  for  the  growth  of  selfsimilar  structures  in  the  computed 
domain.  The  computed  domain  when  resolved  as  a  function  of

logarithmic  spiral  envelope  with  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling 
pattern for the internal structure.

Self-organized  criticality 

in  computed  model  dynamical 
systems,  also  is  a  result  of  quantumlike  mechanical  laws  with 
ordered growth of roundoff error structure similar to growth of large 
eddies from turbulent fluctuations in fluid flows. Such a concept may 
explain the surprising qualitative resemblance of patterns generated 
by computed dynamical systems to patterns in nature (Jurgen et al., 
1990;  Stewart,  1992)  with  underlying  universality  quantified  by  the 
Fibonacci mathematical number series. 

Generation of selfsimilar patterns by space-time integration of 
microscopic  scale  fluctuations  underlie  observed  self-organized 
criticality in real world and computed dynamical systems. 

The  universal  algorithm 

is 
identified  as  Eq.(1),  which  is  the  law  of  conservation  of  energy  for 
space-time  fluctuations.  Eq.(1)  may  be  expressed  in  terms  of 
universal Feigenbaum’s constants a and d as (Selvam, 1993).

Eq.(3)  states  that  the  fractional  volume  intermittency  of 
occurrence ((cid:1)d) of fractal structures contributes to the total variance 
(2a2) of the fluctuations (Selvam, 1993). 

The  physical  mechanism  underlying  observed  self-organized 
criticality  in  real  world  and  computed  model  dynamical  systems  is 
quantified  by  Eq.(3),  which  is  independent  of  the  exact  details 

 

13 

(physical,  chemical,  biological,  physiological,  etc.),  of  dynamical 
systems and therefore applicable to all dynamical systems.  

3.3 Applications of the general systems theory concepts to 

genomic DNA base sequence structure 

DNA  sequences,  the  blueprint  of  all  essential  genetic  information, 
are polymers consisting of two complementary strands of four types 
of  bases:  adenine  (A),  cytosine  (C),  guanine  (G)  and  thymine  (T). 
Among  the  four  bases,  the  presence  of  A  on  one  strand  is  always 
paired  with  T  on  the  opposite  strand,  forming  a  “base  pair”  with  2 
hydrogen  bonds.  Similarly,  G  and  C  are  complementary  to  one 
another,  while  forming  a  base  pair  with  3  hydrogen  bonds. 
Consequently,  one  may  characterize  AT  base-pairs  as  weak bases 
and  GC  base-pairs  as  strong  bases.  In  addition,  the  frequency  of 
A(G)  on  a  single  strand  is  approximately  equal  to  the  frequency  of 
T(C)  on  the  same  strand,  a  phenomenon  that  has  been  termed 
“strand  symmetry”  or  “Chargaff’s  second  parity”.  Therefore,  DNA 
sequences can be transformed into sequences of weak W (A or T) 
and strong S (G or C) bases (Li and Holste, 2001). The SW mapping 
rule is particularly appropriate to analyze genome-wide correlations; 
this rule corresponds to the most fundamental partitioning of the four 
bases  into  their  natural  pairs  in  the  double  helix  (G+C,  A+T).  The 
composition of base pairs, or GC level, is thus a strand-independent 
property  of  a  DNA  molecule  and  is  related  to  important  physico-
chemical properties of the chain (Bernaola-Galvan et al., 2002). The 
full story of how DNA really functions is not merely what is written on 
the  sequence  of  base-pairs; The  DNA functions  involve  information 
transmission over many length scales ranging from a few to several 
hundred nanometers (Ball, 2003). 

One of the major goals in DNA sequence analysis is to gain 
an  understanding  of  the  overall  organization  of  the  genome,  in 
particular,  to  analyze  the  properties  of  the  DNA  string  itself.  Long-
range correlations in DNA base sequence structure, which give rise 
to  1/f  spectra  have  been  identified  (Azad  et  al.,  2002).  Such  long-
range  correlations  in  space-time  fluctuations  is  very  common  in 
nature  and  Li  (2004)  has  given  an  extensive  and  informative 
bibliography  of  the  observed  1/f  noise  or 1/f  spectra,  where  f  is  the 
frequency,  in  biological,  physical,  chemical  and  other  dynamical 
systems.  

The  long-range  correlations  in  nucleotide  sequence  could  in 
principle  be  explained  by  the  coexistence  of  many  different  length 
scales.  The  advantage  of  spectral  analysis  is  to  reveal  patterns 
hidden in a direct correlation function. The quality of the 1/f spectra 
differs  greatly  among  sequences.  Different  DNA  sequences  do  not 
exhibit  the  same  power  spectrum.  The  concentration  of  genes  is 
correlated  with  the  C+G  density.  The  spatial  distribution  of  C+G 
density  can  be  used  to  give  an  indication  of  the  location  of  genes. 
The  final  goal  is  to  eventually  learn  the  ‘genome  organization 
principles’  (Li,  1997).  The  coding  sequences  of  most  vertebrate 

 

14 

genes  are  split  into  segments  (exons)  which  are  separated  by 
noncoding intervening sequences (introns). A very small minority of 
human  genes  lack  noncoding  introns  and  are  very  small  genes 
(Strachan and Read, 1996). 

Li  (2002)  reports  that  spectral  analysis  shows  that  there  are 
GC  content  fluctuations  at  different  length  scales  in  isochore 
(relatively homogeneous) sequences. Fluctuations of all size scales 
coexist in a hierarchy of domains within domains (Li et al., 2003). Li 
and Holste (2004) have recently identified universal 1/f spectra and 
diverse  correlation  structures  in  Guanine  (G)  and  Cytosine  (C) 
content of all human chromosomes. 

In  the  following  it  is  shown  that  the  frequency  distribution  of 
Human  chromosome  Y  DNA  bases  C+G  concentration  per  10bp 
(non-overlapping)  follows  the  model  prediction  (Section  2)  of  self-
organized  criticality  or  quantumlike  chaos  implying  long-range 
spatial  correlations  in the  distribution  of  bases  C+G  along  the  DNA 
base sequence.

4.2 Power spectral analyses: variance and phase spectra 

The number of times base C and also base G, i.e., (C+G), occur in 
successive blocks of 10 bases were determined in successive length 
sections  of  70000  base  pairs  giving  a  C+G  frequency  distribution 
series  of  7000  values  for  each  data  set.  The  power  spectra  of 
frequency distribution of C+G bases in the data sets were computed 
accurately  by  an  elementary,  but  very  powerful  method  of  analysis 
developed  by  Jenkinson  (1977)  which  provides  a  quasi-continuous 
form  of  the  classical  periodogram  allowing  systematic  allocation  of 
the  total  variance  and  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  data  series  to 
logarithmically spaced elements of the frequency range (0.5, 0). The 
cumulative  percentage  contribution  to  total  variance  was  computed 
starting  from  the  high  frequency  side  of  the  spectrum.  The  power 
spectra  were  plotted  as  cumulative  percentage  contribution  to  total 
t.  The 
variance  versus 
corresponding  phase  spectra  were  computed  as  the  cumulative 
percentage contribution to total rotation (Section 2.6). The statistical 
chi-square  test  (Spiegel,  1961)  was  applied  to  determine  the 
‘goodness of fit’ of variance and phase spectra with statistical normal 
distribution.  Details  of  data  sets  and  results  of  power  spectral 
analyses  are  given  in  Table  2.  The  average  variance  and  phase 
spectra for each of the ten contiguous data sets (Table 1) are given 
in Figure 3.

4.3 Power spectral analyses: dominant periodicities 

The general systems theory predicts the broadband power spectrum 
of fractal fluctuations will have embedded dominant wavebands, the 
bandwidth  increasing  with  wavelength,  and  the  wavelengths  being 
functions of the golden mean (Section 2.4, Eq.2). The first 13 values 
of the model predicted (selvam, 1990; selvam and Fadnavis, 1998) 
dominant  peak  wavelengths  are 2.2,  3.6,  5.8,  9.5,  15.3,  24.8, 40.1, 
64.9,  105.0,  167.0,  275,  445.0  and  720  in  units  of  the  block  length 
10bp  (base  pairs)  in  the  present  study.  The  dominant  peak 
wavelengths were grouped into 13 class intervals 2 - 3, 3 - 4, 4 - 6, 6 
- 12, 12 - 20, 20 - 30, 30 - 50, 50 - 80, 80 – 120, 120 – 200, 200 – 
300, 300 – 600, 600 - 1000 (in units of 10bp block lengths) to include 
the model predicted dominant peak length scales mentioned above. 
The  class  intervals  increase  in  size  progressively  to  accommodate 
model  predicted  increase  in  bandwidth  associated  with  increasing 
wavelength.  Average  class  interval-wise  percentage  frequencies  of 
occurrence of dominant wavelengths are shown in Fig. 4 along with 
the  percentage  contribution  to  total  variance  in  each  class  interval

corresponding  to  the  normalised  standard  deviation  t  (Section  2.6) 
computed from the average T50 (Table 2) for the ten data sets. 

Figure  4:  Average  class  interval-wise  percentage  distribution  of  dominant 
(normalized  variance  greater  than  1)  wavelengths  is  given  by  line  +

variance for each class interval is given by line + open circle.

5. Discussions 

In  summary,  a  majority  of  the  data  sets  (Table  2  and  Figure  3) 
exhibit the model predicted quantumlike chaos for fractal fluctuations 
since the variance and phase spectra follow each other closely and 
also  follow  the  universal  inverse  power  law  form  of  the  statistical 
normal distribution signifying long-range correlations or coherence in 
the  overall  frequency  distribution  pattern  of  the  bases  C+G  in 
Human  chromosome  Y  DNA.  Such  non-local  connections  or 
‘memory’  in  the  spatial  pattern  is  a  natural  consequence  of  the

quasicrystalline  structure  of  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling  pattern 
for fractal fluctuations of dynamical systems. Further, the broadband 
power  spectra  exhibit  dominant  wavelengths  closely  corresponding 
to the model predicted (Fig.1 and Eq.2) nested continuum of eddies.

Quasicrystalline structure of the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern 
has  maximum  packing  efficiency  as  displayed  in  plant  phyllotaxis 
(Selvam, 1998) and may be the geometrical structure underlying the 
packing  of  103  to  105  micrometer  of  DNA  in  a  eukaryotic  (higher 
organism)  chromosome  into  a  metaphase  structure  a  few  microns 
long  as  explained  in  the  following.  A  length  of  DNA  equal  to  2pL 
when  coiled  in  a  loop  of  radius  L  has  a  packing  efficiency 
(lengthwise)  equal  to  2pL/2L=p   since  the  linear  length  2pL  is  now 
accommodated  in  a  length  equal  to  the  diameter  2L  of  the  loop. 
Since  each  stage  of  looping  gives  a  packing  efficiency  equal  to p, 
ten  stages  of  such  successive  looping  will  result  in  a  packing 
efficiency equal to p10 approximately equal to 105.  

6. Conclusions 

Real world and model dynamical systems exhibit long-range space-
time  correlations, 
identified  as  self-
i.e.,  coherence,  recently 
organized  criticality.  Macroscale  coherent  functions  in  biological 
from  self-organization  of  microscopic  scale 
systems  develop 
information  flow  and  control  such  as  in  the  neural  networks  of  the 
human  brain  and  in  the  His-Purkinje  fibers  of  human  heart,  which 
govern vital physiological functions. 

A  recently  developed  cell  dynamical  system  model  for 
turbulent  flows  predicts  self-organized  criticality  as  intrinsic  to 
flow  dynamics.  The  model 
quantumlike  mechanics  governing 
concepts  are  independent  of  exact  details  (physical,  chemical, 
biological  etc.)  of  the  dynamical  system  and  are  universally 
applicable.  The  model  is  based  on  the  simple  concept  that  space-
integration  of  microscopic  domain  fluctuations  occur  on 
time 
selfsimilar fractal structures and give rise to the observed space-time 
coherent  behaviour  pattern  with 
long-term  memory. 
Selfsimilar  fractal  structures  to  the  spatial  pattern  for  dynamical 
systems  function  as  dynamic  memory  storage  device  with  memory 
recall and update at all time scales.

Overall 

logarithmic  spiral 

trajectory  with  quasiperiodic 
Penrose tiling pattern are intrinsic to dynamical systems. Such spiral 
architecture  with  Fibonacci  winding  number  and  five-fold  symmetry 
are  ubiquitous  in  plant  kingdom  (Jean, 1988,  1989, 1992a,b,  1994) 
and  are  signatures  of  quantumlike  chaos  in  macroscale  dynamical 
systems.  Simple 
the  exquisite  varied  patterns

The important conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) the 
frequency  distribution  of  bases  C+G  per  10bp  in  chromosome  Y 
DNA exhibit selfsimilar fractal fluctuations which follow the universal 
inverse power law form of the statistical normal distribution (Fig.3), a 
signature  of  quantumlike  chaos.  (2)  Quantumlike  chaos  indicates 
long-range  spatial  correlations  or  ‘memory’  inherent  to  the  self-
organized  fuzzy  logic  network  of  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling 
pattern  (Eq.1  and  Fig.1).  (3)  Such  non-local  connections  indicate 
that coding exons together with non-coding introns contribute to the 
effective functioning of the DNA molecule as a unified whole. Recent 
studies  indicate  that  mutations  in  introns  introduce  adverse  genetic 
defects  (Cohen,  2002).  (4)  The  space  filling  quasiperiodic  Penrose 
tiling  pattern  provides  maximum  packing  efficiency  for  the  DNA 
molecule inside the chromosome.

Self-focusing, spatially stable, electron beams arising from heating up to 1600 C and 
cooling to room temperature pyroelectric LiNbO3  crystals in dilute gases have been observed for 
the first time. The current (up to nanoamperes) and energies (up to 170 keV) of these electron 
beams attained maximum values and then decreased during the cooling phase of the thermal 
cycle. Cylindrical crystals produced spatially stable beams with typical focal lengths of 22 mm 
and 1mm spot sizes.  Here we present photographic as well as electronic proof of their existence. 

 
                                         INTRODUCTION 
 
Although some of the remarkable electrical properties of pyroelectric crystals have been 

known since ancient Greek times 1, surprising new effects and practical applications are 
constantly being discovered 1-6.  There is a voluminous literature on electron emission by 
pyroelectric crystals.  Reference 6, a comprehensive review article and  (7-11) are representative 
but none of them suggests that electron beams are emitted by such crystals. Pyroelectric crystals 
become electrically charged on heating or cooling and can produce electric fields at their 
surfaces of up to 106 V/cm.  If the crystal is cut perpendicular to its three-fold rotationally-
symmetric z axis, the surface called the  -z base becomes positively charged on heating and then 
negatively charged on cooling.  Much of the current industrial use of these crystals is in infrared 
detection, sensitive temperature change detectors and photonics, e.g., the detection of THz 
radiation 12 in LiNbO3.  This makes plausible the fact that the electron-beam phenomenon 
reported here has not been seen previously. 

 
                                               DISCUSSION 
 
This report describes the production of self-focusing electron beams arising from near 

pyroelectric crystal surfaces in dilute gases after the crystal has been heated and returned to room 
temperature.  In one case a glass tube was used to house a 5 mm diam x 5 mm cylindrical 
LiNbO3  crystal in an atmosphere of <10 mtorr of dry N2.  The crystal was heated to 1150 C and 
then allowed to cool to room temperature.  Heat was supplied by passing  ~100 mA through a 
wire-wound 60 ohm resistor which was epoxied to the crystal’s + z base. After cooling to room 
temperature, spatially stable electron beams were produced.  They were made visible by placing

a ZnS screen at the focal length (17 mm) of the crystal as illustrated in Fig. 1(a), which shows a 
photograph of the ZnS screen; the cylindrical crystal and the 60 ohm wire-wound resistor used to 
heat the crystal.  We studied the effect of pressure on the beam. Typical results at ~0.5 mtorr 
1(b), ~3 mtorr 1(c) and ~8 mtorr 1(d) are shown in Fig 1(b), 1(c), 1(d) respectively.  As the 
pressure increased, the beam spot became more diffuse and brighter.  At ~8 mtorr the beam blew 
up and its intensity dropped to zero.   The dynamical behavior of the electron beam with pressure 
suggests a gas-multiplication effect.   All results reported on in this paper were repeated many 
times. 

Next a 100 (m surface-barrier electron detector replaced the ZnS screen.  The 

experimental arrangement is shown in Fig. 2.  The crystal and heater assembly could be moved 
toward or away from the detector, which was useful for checking the focusing effect.  The 
detector was covered by a lead screen with a 0.1mm slit so that the beam profile could be 
obtained by moving the slit-detector assembly at constant speed across the beam at different 
crystal-to-slit distances.   Fig 3 shows results of scans at different crystal-to-slit distances.  The 
best focus occurs when that distance is 17 mm. A further illustration of the focusing effect is 
seen in Fig. 4 where a different cylindrical crystal (4mm diam  x 10mm LiNbO3) and heater 
assembly was moved in and out relative to the detector slit.   Here the focal length was 22 mm 
and the focusing effect was very dramatic.  Once the crystal reached room temperature the beam 
energy decreased nearly exponentially with time (Fig. 5); faster with increasing pressure. The 
time-dependent electron-beam energy spectrum which was taken in “snapshot mode”, i.e. over 
an interval of  <60 s, typically, exhibited discrete peaks at integral multiples of the lowest energy 
peak.  This indicated that multiple electron production4 was occurring.  In order to produce 
higher energy beams the crystal was heated from the + z base to 1600 C and allowed to cool to 
room temperature at <10 mtorr.  It produced maximum energy electron beams of up to 145 keV 
when the temperature was ~300 C.  That the electron beam energy was at least 80 keV (Au K 
edge) for a significant time was confirmed by irradiating gold and observing the K X-rays 2,3. 

The focusing effect shows that the electric field lines near the crystal surface are slightly 
inclined toward the axis, which is reasonable since the field at the edges of the crystal is higher 
than at the center.  If the crystal is subjected to a rapid temperature change the polarization will 
be manifested briefly by the presence of an electric field whose strength is proportional to the 
surface charge density, which in turn is a function of the change in temperature and depends on 
the ambient pressure.   When the crystal is in a reduced pressure environment and is subjected to 
the same temperature change, the polarization change is manifested by an electric field that lasts 
much longer; at a pressure of about 10-6 torr, it takes more than 30 hours for the resulting surface 
charge to be neutralized, whereas at 1 atm neutralization is virtually instantaneous.  The 
neutralization of the electric field produced by a change in polarization is due to bombardment of 
and attachment to the surface by positive ions.  In conclusion, as long as the net surface charge is 
sufficiently negative, electrons are accelerated away from the crystal in a focused beam whose 
energy is constantly changing and after the crystal has reached room temperature, even before in 
some cases, the beam is spatially stable. 

The above described results together with the recent discovery that at pressures in the 10-5 

torr range, focused 100 keV positive-ion beams are generated on heating the crystal were 
reported5 at the Beams Division of the Spring Meeting of the American Physical Society.

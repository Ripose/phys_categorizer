# - Abstract 
 
Classical,  Quantum  and  Relativistic  mechanics  elect  time  and  space  as  fundamentals, 
extracting  the  measure  of  motion  –velocity–  from  this  static  space-time  platform. 
Conversely, the timelessness of Statistical mechanics computes the physical flow as an 
evolution of (dynamical) states which, at the end, comes to be what would be denoted as 
time.  Moreover,  the  general  structure  of  mechanics  is  such  that  the  notion  of 
observability  is  mixed  up  with  that  of  measurability.  In  such  a  context,  ignoring  the 
distinction  between  "observable  entities"  and  "measurable  quantities",  and  projecting 
dynamical  objects  on  a  static  background,  the  measured  value  of  physical  entities  is 
taken  as  the  true  or  real  value  of  the  entity.  This  contribution  emphasises  this 
distinction,  correlating  the  concepts  of    "real  values"  and  "experimental  values"  and 
indicating  that  motion  is  always  underestimated  in  the  spatiotemporal  platform; 
following  a  gauge  transformation,  an  argument  centred  on  measurability  favours  a 
relational "non-relativistic" formulation, with potentially analogous predictions.  

 
 

# 1 – Introduction 

 
 
At the present time it is probably much more simple to develop a measurement 
process  to  any  physical  entity  than  to  specify  the  physical  nature  of  the  obtained 
quantity;  the  proliferation  of  processes,  methods  and  compatible  instrumentation  was 
not  accompanied  by  a  unifying  theoretical  perspective.  In  fact,  a  well-recognised 
situation [1] is that Nature appears divided in to " theories of the Macro " and " theories 
of the Micro ", not to say "physics of the slow" and "physics of the swift".  

Macroscopic  phenomena,  large–scale  objects,  are  governed  by  relativistic 
mechanics  that,  in  some  sense,  incorporates  classical  mechanics.  Microscopic  objects 
follow the laws of quantum mechanics. Multiple-small-scale-objects are assumed to be 
governed by statistical mechanics, in collective (complex) phenomena. A "swift–slow" 
scheme of classification could tell the same story, with a more sounded physical basis 
once  the  pragmatism  of  motion  appears  more  satisfactory than that of size, except  for 
quantum mechanics. 

The concepts of big and small are consistently treated by quantum physics who 
gave  an  absolute  meaning  to  the  size  as  well  as  relativity  theory  gave  an  absolute 
meaning  to  the  motion.  Throughout  the  proposal  of  the  postulate  of  relativity,  in  the 
context  of  the  Michelson-Morley  experiment,  from  which  the  Lorentz-Fitzgerald 
contraction can be deduced, Einstein [2] pointed out that if nature conspires in such a 
way  to  prevent  us  from  determining  experimentally  the  absolute  motion  of  our 
instruments, then the notion of an absolute velocity has no meaning.

 Analogously, revising the classical ideas of Causality, Dirac [3] pointed out that 
in order to give an absolute meaning to size, such as is required for any theory of the 
ultimate structure of matter, it is necessary to assume that there is a limit of the power of 
observation:  if  the  object  under  observation  is  such  that  the  unavoidable  limiting 
disturbance  is  negligible,  then  the  object  is  big  in  the  absolute  sense;  if,  on  the  other 
hand, the limiting disturbance is not negligible, then the object is small in the absolute 
sense. 

Remarkably, these diverse approaches to the absolute coincide on accepting the 
fact  that  motion  detection,  a  difficult  experimental  measurement  even  in  Classical 
terms, can give rise to an absolute value, precisely in the case of a small and fast object. 
Velocity  measurements  imply  detection  of  two  events  evolving  on  distinct  space 
locations;  conversely,  single  point  detection  associated  to  motion  transfer  (energy  / 
momentum) has the advantage of a direct measurement but is experimentally limited by 
the uncertainty principle at the quantum level and by the 'motion transfer model' in any 
situation. The figure below illustrates a conventional indirect velocity measurement in 
the space – time platform.

Figure 1 -  Velocity measurement in space-time: an  observer + instrumentation "O" at 
X0 observes the passage of an object (velocity v) and realises a measurement of the time 
lasted for the dislocation between the positions X0 and X1 . 
 

Now,  even  adopting  the  space-time  platform,  motion  detection  should  be 
invariant  in  a  sense  that  the  physical  observable  entity  (velocity)    corresponds  to  the 
concrete measured quantity (the particular velocity), independent of the coordinates of 
the  platform.  This  implies  independent  measurements  on  the  platform  and  a  way  of 
vanishing the background coordinates (time and space); another possibility is to balance 
with an off–platform gauge. The analysis here follow this "off background" method.

Where  ∆t  is the effective time that the particle lasts between X0 and X1 , ∆tm the 
 
measured time of the motion between X0 and X1 and ∆ti the time required for the signal 
(object's image) to come back to the observer "O" at X0 . 
 

Equation (1) is an uncertainty relation, that is:  

t ∆≤∆

mt
This means that the real time ∆t is not exactly equal to the time ∆tm detected by 
instrumentation. Thus, relative to the phenomena, Observer is always in the past, once 
the detected value of the time is limited by the time required for the signal to arrive at 
measurement location. The real time of motion can be written as: 
 

 

where ∆X is the X0 X1 distance and v the (real ) velocity of the object. 
The signal (transportation) time ∆ti can be written as,

This  equation  relates  the  real  time  ∆t  of  a  fact  (motion  of  an  object)  with  the 
 
measured ∆tm time of the observed effect (passage of the object throughout space from 
X0 to X1). This means that the detectable effect of a real fact (evolving at velocity v and 
lasting ∆t) is delayed by a factor {1+ v / vs}. Thus, for any finite signal velocity, a time 
measurement  overestimates  the  real  value. Moreover,  since all measured times can be 
computed  by  this  same  "out  of  platform"  factor,  an  independent  determination  of  the 
quotient v / vs can settle relation (5), that is, time, into concrete physical grounds; this 
demands for an analysis of velocity measurements.

Employing relations (2) and (5) this equation becomes:

This equation relates the real velocity v of a fact with the measured velocity vm 
 
of the effect. Note that the real velocity value is different from the measured one by a 
factor  {1  +  v  /  vs}.  Thus,  for  any  finite  vs,  vm  <  v,  that  is,  a  velocity  measurement 
underestimates the true value. 
 
These equations show that time and velocity measurements are governed by the 
same {1 + v / vs } factor, where the quotient v / vs determines the distance between the 
experimental and the true values. In order to increase precision on both measurements, 
it is convenient to reduce the time ∆ti required for signal transportation, that is, increase 
vs, employing a fast signal carrier, such as a light pulse. This demands for knowledge of 
the effective value of the velocity of light. 

The  measured  value  of  the  propagation  of  light  in  vacuum  is  'c'.    Employing 
relation (7) with v = vs and taking the experimental value vm = c, the value of the light 
pulse is: 

 

vs = 2c                ( 8 ) 

Substituting this value in relations (5) and (7):

Equations  (9)  and  (10)  show  explicitly  the  distinction  between  the  observable 
value (the intangible real value of times and velocities) and the measured values of these 
entities;  both  equations  show  that  the  off  platform  factor  {1–vm  /  2c}  governs  the 
measurement.  However,  the  action  of  this  factor  is  distinct:  in  (9)  the  factor  simply 
corrects  the  experimental  value,  reflecting  the  well  known  relativistic  dilation  effect; 
conversely, equation (10) can be worked out to show that:

This last form shows that the measured velocity vm is harmonically related to the 
real value v by means of the signal velocity (2c or vs); that is, the measurement process 
collapses the true (observable) value to the experimental (measurable) data.

# 4 – Comments 
 
 
The  distinction  between  Observability  and  Measurability  is  anccient;  in  the 
 
words  of  Plato  [4],  "  the  starry  heaven  which  we  behold  is  wrought  upon  a  visible 
ground,  and  therefore,  although  the  fairest  and  most  perfect  of    visible  things,  must 
necessarily  be  deemed  inferior  far  too  the  true  motions  of  absolute  swiftness  and 
absolute slowness, which are relative to each other, and carry with them that which is 
contained  in  them,  in  the  true  number  and  in  every  true  figure.  Now,  these  are  to  be 
apprehended by reason, but not by sight ". This solves the enigma of intangibility. 
There is an unavoidable intangibility in the calculation of measurable data, the 
 
theoretical  method  enabling  only  the  possibility  (not  the  probability)  of  obtaining  an 
exact  (quantum  mechanical  sense)  result.  Therefore,  the  presence  of  the  uncertainty 
principle  in  equation  (1)  is  quite  reasonable;  moreover,  (1)  and  (10)  can  also  be 
considered as gauge transformations: 
 

∆+∆→∆

In  technical  terms,  the  gauge  transformation  (1.A)  leads  to  the  velocity  gauge 
(10.A). A priori, any choice of the gauge is possible, once both satisfy the condition of 
measurability  and  will  'act'  as  the  same  factor  in  equations  (9)  and  (10).  On  the  other 
hand, absence of this gauge transformation means no gauge at all. 
 
The  advantage  of  the  vs  gauge  is  the  substitution  of  the  static  space–time 
platform  by  a  velocity–space  dynamical  background,  where  the  physical  flow  do 
happens, in which relative localisation of physical entities is the rule and from which a 
spatiotemporal stage can be extracted.  
 
Finally, there seems to be a fundamental relationship between velocity and space 
but  not  among  time  and  those;  equation  (9)  sets  time  in  to  the  concrete  basis  of  a 
balance of velocities but it also tells that time depends on the existence of the physical 
flow. This is consistent with the statistical mechanics (thermodynamically sense) notion 
that considers this entity as state dependent, appearing only connected to the evolution 
of states (motion). 
 
 
 
# 5 – Conclusions  
 
 
Observability  plays  a  central  hole  in  physics,  leaving  the  choice  of  the 
 
background  to  describe  the  physical  flow  in  a  second  plane;  however;  the  velocity–
space  dynamical  platform  appears  superior  to  the  static  space-time  stage  once 
localisation is intrinsically relative (relational). 
A  partial  equivalence  between  the  spatiotemporal  and  the  velocity–space 
 
platform  can  be  achieved  by  a  gauge  transformation,  resulting  on  the  indication  that 
motion is always underestimated in space–time.

Development  of  a  formalism  based  on  the  velocity  gauge  may  give  rise  to  a 
 
synthetic  treatment  of  the  physical  flow  in  terms  of  suitable  coordinates;  this 
contribution  also  emphasises  that  the  velocity  gauge  approach  may  retain  the  basic 
ingredients  of  classical,  quantum  and  statistical  mechanics,  without  the  limitations 
imposed by relativity.

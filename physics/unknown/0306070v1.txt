1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Polarization  observations  offer  new  opportunities  in  atmosphere 
aerosol  sounding,  and  the  POLDER  space  instrument  and  the 
AERONET ground network began to apply it. Using the observations 
of 
they  determine  aerosol 
characteristics  averaged  over  column  with  predomination  of  the 
lower-troposphere  part  of  column.  We  investigate  the  opportunity  to 
the  vertical  profile  of  aerosol  characteristics  using 
determine 
polarization observations during twilight period.  
 
The  essential  trouble  in  solution  of  the  raising  aerosol  inverse 
problem  is  multiple  scattering  of  light,  which  may  have  the  same 
depolarizing  effect  like  the  aerosol.  We  had  proposed  the  algorithm 
for  retrieval  of  the  aerosol  characteristic  vertical  profile  and  carried 
in  approximation  of  single  scattering 
out 
(Section 6.3).  To  evaluate  the  fraction  of  multiple  scattering  we  had 
developed  both  its  semi-empirical  model,  basing  on  observations 
(Section 3), and a radiative transfer model, which take into account all 
orders  of  scattering  (Section  4).  The  main  goal  of  this  paper  is  a 
comparison of polarized radiance and characteristics derived from the

characteristics  derived  from  numerical  simulation  of  the  radiative 
transfer for different aerosol (Sections 6.1, 6.2).  
 
Definitions of used terms are given in Appendix A. 
 
2. INSTRUMENTATION AND OBSERVATIONS 
 
First  session  of  polarimetric  observations  was  carried  out  in  summer 
1997 at the Astronomical Observatory of Odessa University, Ukraine 
(46.40(cid:176) N,  30.25(cid:176) E).  The  solar  vertical  was  scanned  in  a  range  of 
zenith  distances  z  from  –70(cid:176)   to  +70(cid:176) ,  the  wavelength  was  equal  to  
356  nm  [1].  Second  session  of  observations  was  carried  out  in 
summer  2000  in  South  Laboratory  of  Sternberg  Astronomical 
Institute,  Crimea,  Ukraine  (44.73(cid:176) N,  34.02(cid:176) E)  [2].  We  made  the 
wide-angle  polarimetric  CCD-images  of  the  near-zenith  region  with 
the  values  of  zenith  distance  from  –15(cid:176)   to  +15(cid:176)   in  four  wide  colour 
regions  (360,  440,  550  and  700  nm).  One  more  session  of  550  nm 
observations  was  held  at  the  same  place  in  late  2002.  Simultaneous 
observations  at  Kislovodsk  City  and  Kislovodsk  High-Mountain 
(43.73(cid:176) N,  42.66(cid:176) E,  2070  m.a.s.l.)  Stations  of  the  Institute  of 
Atmospheric  Physics,  at  Zvenigorod  (55.7(cid:176) N,  36.8(cid:176) E)  and  at 
Lovozero  (67.97(cid:176) N,  35.02(cid:176) E)  were  carried  out  in  1999-2000  by 
photometer  with  rotating  polarizing  glass.  The  observations  were 
performed at 800 nm in the zenith direction [3]. 

 

3. SEMI-EMPIRICAL MODEL FOR 
MULTIPLE SCATTERING SEPARATION 
 
A  method  of  single  and  multiple  scattered  light  separation  using 
observations  of  polarization  of  twilight  sky  was  developed  in  [1,  2]. 
The simplified idea of the method follows. When the Sun is situated 
near the horizon, the maximum polarization point of single scattering 
should be situated about 90(cid:176)  from it (or exactly 90(cid:176)  if the scattering is 
molecular) or near the zenith. And as the Sun is depressing, this point 
 
2

follows  it  by  the  vertical  to  the  glow  segment,  remaining  at  the 
constant angular distance from the Sun (since the effective scattering 
altitude is not changing rapidly at this twilight period). The maximum 
polarization  point  for  multiple  scattering  at  the  sunset  is  expected  to 
be near the zenith too, but as the secondary light source is the whole 
sky and basically, the glow area, and not directly related with the Sun, 
this point should be practically immovable remaining near the zenith. 
And thus, the position of the maximum polarization point for the total 
sky  background  will  be  the  reflection  of  the  single  and  multiple 
scattering balance. 
 
A  mathematical  procedure  of  the  single  scattering  contribution 
calculation is described in [1]. This procedure uses the polarization of 
light  incoming  from  a  few  zenith  directions  for  a  few  solar  depth 
angles  during  twilight.  The  main  quantity  used  in  this  method  is 
polarization  ratio  mixed  derivative  d2K/dzdzS  (see  Appendix  A  for 
definitions).  This  value  strongly  depends  on  the  single  scattering 
contribution  and  aerosol  phase  matrix  at  the  scattering  angle  near  to 
90(cid:176) ,  and  we  can  use  both  sky  polarization  and  this  value  measured 
during the observation as the test of different aerosol models. 
 
Figure  1  shows  the  dependence  of  the  maximum  polarization  point 
zenith distance on the solar zenith angle for one date of simultaneous 
observations in 550 and 700 nm. The blue line is corresponding to the 
case of pure Rayleigh single scattering. We can see that at light phase 
of twilight until the Sun depression about 4-5 degrees, the maximum 
polarization  point  really  follows  the  Sun,  but  the  velocity  of  such 
motion is lower a bit than for the case of pure single scattering. It is 
pointing  to  almost  constant  ratio  of  single  and  multiple  scattering  at 
this  time.  And  then  this  point  is  turning  back  to  the  zenith,  and 
polarization  profile  of  the  whole  solar  vertical  becomes  symmetric 
relatively  the  zenith.  It  can  be  related  only  with  the  single  scattering 
light disappearing on the background of multiple scattering.

4. RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODEL MCC++ 
 
A simulation of the twilight polarized radiance was performed using a 
Monte  Carlo  linearized  radiative  transfer  model  MCC++  [4].  The 
MCC++  model  calculates  radiative  transfer  in  the  spherical  shell 
atmosphere  with  account  of  all  orders  of  scattering,  aerosol  and 
Rayleigh  scattering,  aerosol  and  gaseous  absorption  and  surface 
albedo. The MCC++ makes quick computations: the computation time 
for 1% accuracy is comparable with pseudospherical radiative transfer 
models  of  other  authors.  The  code  was  validated  against  other 
radiative  transfer  models  for  the  twilight  observations [5]. For usage 
in  retrieval  problems  the  model  may  perform  quick  calculation  of 
weighting functions [6]. 
 
Calculations  were  carried  out  for  the  solar  zenith  angle  up  to  96(cid:176)   at 
wavelengths equal to 360, 440, 550, 700, 800 nm.

5. MODELS OF ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOL 
 
A few types of the aerosol microphysical characteristics proposed by 
WMO  (see  [7]  and  Appendix  C)  were  used  for  radiative  transfer 
calculations,  simulating  the  different  aerosol  scenarios.  The  urban, 
continental  and  maritime  types  of  aerosol  from  0  to  10  km  were 
compared  with  observations.  The  stratospheric  type  of  aerosol  at 
latitudes  above  10  km  was  used  in  all  cases.  The  phase  matrix, 
absorption  and  scattering  cross  sections  of  aerosol  were  calculated 
using Mie theory. 
 
MODTRAN  aerosol  extinction  profile  at  600  nm,  corresponding  to 
surface visible range 50 km and background stratospheric aerosol, was 
used in all cases. 
 
The other atmospheric characteristics are given in Appendix B. 
 
6. ANALYSIS 
 
6.1. Degree of linear polarization 
 
Figure 2a shows observed degree of polarization in the zenith against 
calculated by the radiative transfer model for the urban type of aerosol 
and background aerosol vertical profile. Calculations with this type of 
aerosol had shown the better agreement with observational data than 
the continental and maritime ones. Last fact can be clearly visible in 
the  Figure  3,  where  the  observational  values  of  polarization  ratio 
mixed  derivative  (see  Appendix  A)  is  compared  with  model 
calculations  for  different  aerosol  types.  Diverse  of  degree  of 
polarization between measurements and calculations for urban aerosol 
does not exceed several percents for all observed wavelengths.

Both  measurements  and  calculations  show  that  the  degree  of 
polarization  is  strongest  in  the  red  part  of  spectrum.  For  shorter 
wavelengths  the  polarization  is  weaker,  but  its  dependence  on  the 
solar zenith depth remains the same. This quantity is almost constant 
or  even  slightly  rises  from  the  sunset  to  the  depressions  about  4-5 
degrees  and  then  starts  to  fall.  Here  we  should  notice  that  the  sky 
color has the same behavior: getting slightly red before, it turns blue 
at the same depressions of Sun, as it can be seen in Figure 2b which is 
based  on  the  results  of  [8].  At  the  same  solar  zenith  distance  the 
maximum polarization point is returning to the zenith (see Figure 1). 
As it was shown in [2], the nature of color and polarization changes of 
the  sky  at  this  twilight  stage  is  common  and  related  with  single-  to 
multiple-scattering ratio changes. 

6.2. Contribution of single scattered light 
 
Figure  4  shows  the  single  scattering  contribution  for  the  sunrise 
(sunset)  moment  at  the  zenith  for  observations  in  1997,  2000  and 
2002 calculated by the semi-empirical model in comparison with the 
radiative  transfer  calculations  for  pure  Rayleigh  scattering  and 
different  aerosol  models.  The  single  scattered  light  (compared  with 
multiple  scattered  one)  has  an  excess  in  long-wave  part  of  spectrum 
and stronger polarization, and it explains the observed correlation of 
twilight polarization and color evolution which is visible in Figure 2 
(a  and  b).  This  comparison  confirms  that  estimations  of  single 
scattering by this semi-empirical model [1] have higher accuracy than 
earlier works, which underestimated multiple scattering.  
 

6.3. Vertical profile retrieval 
 
We  carried  out  numerical  experiments  on  aerosol  profile  retrieval 
using  one  wavelength  800 nm  and  one  (zenith)  direction  of 
observations.  Such  measurements  can  not  provide  simultaneous 
determination  of  the  concentration  and  microphysical  characteristics 
of  aerosol.  Therefore,  microphysical  characteristics  of  aerosol  were 

 

8

 

taken  as  known.  The  model  [7]  was  used:  continental  aerosol  below  
10 km, and stratospheric aerosol above 10 km. For future convenience 
of  comparison  of  retrieved  data  with  data  of  lidar  sounding,  the 
profiles of aerosol backscattering ratios was retrieved. The algorithm 
[4]  of  retrieval  is  based  on  optimal  statistical  estimation  method. 
Measurement  errors  were  taken  as  typical  for  observation  at 
Kislovodsk in 2002. A simulation was performed in approximation of 
single  scattering,  thus,  correction  of  observed  polarized  radiance  is 
necessary if the algorithm is applied to real data. 
 
The  dependence  of  the  retrieval  error  on  the  vertical  resolution  is 
given in Figure 5. The errors were calculated for a measurement at 60 
solar zenith angles from z = 90.1(cid:176)  to z = 96(cid:176)  with step 0.1(cid:176) . Percentages 
were calculated for background aerosol profile. Notice that in periods 
subsequent to powerful volcanic eruptions the aerosol concentration is 
enhanced. In such periods, the percentage error may become less than 
10%. At heights below 5 km, the relative error decreases due to high 
aerosol  concentrations  in  the  atmospheric  surface  layer  (not  shown). 
As  the  vertical  resolution  degrades  to  5 km,  the  retrieval  error 
decreases  below  40%  for  all  heights  above  11 km.  At  a  further 
degradation  of  the  vertical  resolution,  the  retrieval  error  does  not 
decrease sufficiently. Figures 6–8 illustrate the numerical experiment 
on aerosol profile retrieval. The true aerosol layer is characterized by 
thickness  of  2 km  and  range  of  aerosol  concentration  variation  equal 
to the background concentration. At a resolution of 1 km, it is difficult 
to  reveal  such  a  model  layer  against  the  noise  background;  at  a 
resolution  of  2 km,  the  layer  manifests  itself  rather  well;  and,  at  a 
resolution  of  3 km,  the  layer  is  clearly  pronounced  but  its  form  is 
noticeably distorted.

7. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Observed  during  1997-2002  at  the  different  locations  the  degree  of 
polarization  well  agrees  with  radiative  transfer  calculations  for  the 
urban  type  of  microphysics  [7]  and  background  profile  of  aerosol. 
Coincidence  of  measurements  and  calculations  is  within  6%  for  the 
most solar zenith angles and angles of observation. 
 
The percentage of single scattered light at the zenith during twilight is 
equal  to  about  40%  for  360  nm,  60%  for  440,  70%  for  550  nm  and 
reaches 80% for 700 nm, what confirmed by both the semi-empirical 
model  based  on  the  measurements,  and  the  radiative  transfer 
calculations.  This  fact  is  the  reason  of  the  lower  sky  polarization  at 
shorter  wavelengths.  These  percentages  remain  almost  constant  until 
the sun’s depth under horizon 4-5(cid:176) , when the part of single scattering 
rapidly  decreases,  and  the  sky  polarization  falls.  At  the  sun’s  depth 
about 10(cid:176)  single scattered light completely disappears on the multiple 
scattered background. 
 
A  theoretical  error  analysis  shows  that  measurements  carried  out  at 
800  nm  with  the  IAP  instrument  has  accuracy  enough  to  detect  a  
2-km aerosol layer, which exceeds background concentration by more 
than 50% at 12-25 km or by 60% at 5-45 km, or detect a 5-km aerosol 
layer, which exceeds background concentration by more than 25% at 
18-20  km  or  by  40%  at  11-45  km.  Notice  that  in  periods  of  the 
enhanced  aerosol  concentration  (after  powerful  volcanic  eruptions) 
this retrieval error may become less than 10%.

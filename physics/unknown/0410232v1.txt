Abstract 

On TRIAM-1M, a long duration discharge for more than 5 h was achieved 

successfully by fully non-inductive lower hybrid current drive. Heat load distribution to 
the plasma facing components (PFCs) in the 5 h discharge was investigated by using 
calorimetric measurements. The injected RF power was coincident with the total 
amount of heat load to PFCs estimated by calorimetric measurement. The power 
balance including the portion of direct loss power of fast electron, heat flux due to the 
charge exchange process was able to be estimated in this long duration discharge.

1.  Introduction 

The steady state operation is important for realize the fusion power plant. In ITER, 
over 1000 sec duration discharge has been planned [1]. In this case, the heat flux to the 
divertor will be estimated 5 MW/m2 [2] and treatment of this local huge heat load is a 
key issue for steady state operation. One method for treatment of heat is effective 
cooling for plasma facing components (PFCs). In Tore Supra, the CIEL project using 
the toroidal pump limiter (TPL) has been enforced. TPL was designed to extract power 
up to 15 MW [3]. Exhausting huge heat load allows implementation of the injection of 
high power to plasmas. In fact, the CIEL project succeeded to maintain the discharge for 
6 min. Total injected energy reached up to 1 GJ, which means that the averaged heat 
load of 2.8 MW could be removed from PFCs continuously. Although the total cooling 
capability was enough, the discharge was terminated contrary to the will. This suggests 
that the heat and particle handling, that is the control of the distribution of heat load, is 
not sufficient to maintain the plasma in steady state. The avoidance of the concentration 
of the heat load should be investigated. In fact, for ITER scenario a radiative power 
fraction of  ≈ 75% will be required to avoid the concentration of heat load to the 
divertor plate [4]. Therefore, the study of heat load distribution in steady state is very 
important. The distribution of heat load has been decided by the power balance of the 
plasma. When the distribution of heat load would be controlled, the knowledge of the 
power balance of the plasma plays an essential role. Therefore the study of the power 
balance should be executed.   

On TRIAM-1M, it was obtained that more than 5 h discharge maintained by lower 
hybrid current drive (LHCD) with the quite low power region. This ultra long duration 
discharge is suitable to measure the heat load, because the water temperature is 
saturated during the discharge. As in this situation, the heat load can be derived from the 
steady temperature rise as shown in section 3, accuracy of estimation of the heat load 
become to be better. In this paper, the result of the heat load to each PFC is described 

and the power balance of the discharge is shown. In section 2 experimental apparatus is 
introduced and the way to measure the heat load is shown in section3. The experimental 
results are presented in section 4. The conclusion of this paper is summarized in section 
5. 

 

2.  Experimental apparatus 

TRIAM-1M is a small size (R0 = 0.8 m, a×b = 0.12 m×0.18 m) tokamak with the 

high toroidal magnetic field up to 8 T excited by 16 toroidal field coils made of the 
super-conducting material, Nb3Sn [5]. TRIAM-1M has two vacuum vessels. One is to 
avoid thermal penetration into superconducting coils from outward. The vacuum level 
should maintain a low pressure level less than 1×10-5 Pa. The other is to keep the 
vacuum condition of 1×10-6 Pa or less for making plasma. Fig.1 is toroidal cross 
section diagrams of the latter vacuum vessel made of stainless steel and divertor plates. 
Numbering on the vacuum vessel shows the branch of the cooling water channel as 
described below. The shadow area on Fig.1 shows the region covered by divertor plates 
made of molybdenum, which have been installed on the down part of the vacuum vessel. 
As shown in Fig.1, five limiters covered by molybdenum are installed on the vacuum 
vessel. Three poloidal ring limiters are illustrated in Fig.1. These limiters are distributed 
in the toroidal direction to avoid the direct contact with the plasma to the vacuum vessel. 
Their size is the same value in width of 32 mm and in poloidal length of 1040 mm. 
These limiters are installed on stainless steel bases, which play a role in attachment of 
the fixed limiter on the surface of the vacuum vessel. These limiters could be cooled 
indirectly through water channels made of copper brazed on the stainless steel base. 
Especially, as the inner and outer part of limiters could not equip any water cooling 
channels, thermal transport of their parts is quite poor than the other part of fixed

limiters. A limiter installed on the top port of the vacuum vessel moves in the vertical 
direction, which has been called the vertical movable limiter (VML). The limiter head is 
composed of molybdenum brazed on the water cooled support made of stainless steel 
using thin copper foil attachment. As the result, thermal transport is better than other 
limiters. The moving distance could be varied by use of a bellows seal and a motor in 
the range of +32.5 mm and +80 mm, where the plus sign means the direction to the 
plasma side from the surface of the poloidal fixed ring limiter. The area of the plasma 
facing surface is 30×160 mm2. The other movable limiter could shift its surface in the 
horizontal direction up to +23 mm which called the horizontal movable limiter (HML). 
A single probe is installed on the HML and the parameters of the SOL plasma have 
been estimated. The area of the plasma facing surface is 34×74 mm2. This limiter is 
made of cupper covered with molybdenum. A molybdenum cover is fixed to the copper 
base by four screws, therefore thermal transport is not so good compared with the VML. 
The copper base attaches a water cooled support. 

Two kinds of the microwave source in frequency of 2.45 and 8.2 GHz to excite the 
lower hybrid wave (LHW) and a microwave source in frequency of 170 GHz to inject 
the electron cyclotron wave (ECW) have been installed as the additional heating on 
TRIAM-1M. The microwave source in frequency of 2.45 GHz could produce up to 
50kW in steady state and it mainly used in the experiments described in this paper. A 
source microwave excited by a crystal has been amplified by a klystron. The high power 
microwave transferred through the waveguide with rectangle cross-section to a launcher 
made of stainless steel for injecting the microwave to the plasma. A launching system is 
the 4×1 grill type waveguide array. The phase difference, ∆Φ, between adjacent 
waveguides can be changed by phase shifters [6]. On the 5 h operation, ∆Φ=110 
degrees were used. Injection power is estimated by microwave power attenuated by the 
directional coupler in front of the inlet of the launcher. Attenuated microwave power 
was measured with corrected crystal diodes. Thus injected power can be measured 
during the discharge. For obtaining exact power absorbed to the plasma, it needs to 
estimate reflected power back to the launcher, uncoupling power, and power loss by 
propagation through the launcher. Reflected power back to the launcher is measured by 
the same way of that of injected power. The reflected microwave mainly excited by the 
coupling of the microwave and the plasma. Uncoupling microwave power was 
measured as leaked microwave 
power through the vacuum window 
made of sapphire. The correction of 
the power level is executed by the 
following way. Leak microwave 
power is measured at the window 
when the microwave is injected 
directly to the vacuum vessel. This 
gives the corrected relation of 
injected power to leaked power. 
Leaked power is measured in several 
discharges. These results are shown in 
Fig.2. As a result leaked power is 
estimated 7W every 1kW of injected

power. Unfortunately the measurement of leaked power was not executed in the 5 h 
discharge. The estimated value of leaked power in 5 h discharge is shown in Fig.2. The 
microwave will also lose power via the dumping process of the microwave propagation 
in the waveguide. As the launcher is made of stainless steel, resistance of the surface of 
the waveguide is significantly high. Power loss on the launcher should be estimated to 
get net injected power. 

Cooling water systems are illustrated in Fig.3. Cooling water systems for the HML 

are independent from the other cooling system for PFCs. The main cooling water 
system has been used pure water produced by the ion-exchange resin method. The 
branch of the cooling water for 2.45GHz is connected to the main cooling water loop 
through only heat exchanger as shown in Fig.3. Main cooling water channels are 
divided 18 branches. Each part of the cooling water temperature is measured with

thermistors whose accuracy is comparable to 0.02 degree. The thermistors are thermal 
sensitive resistor and their resistance value changes significantly by the very small 
temperature change. The measurement spot is executed on the inlet and the outlet. 
Increment of water temperature between the inlet and the outlet, ∆T, is necessary to 
estimate the heat load to each PFC. The measurement is implemented on 38 points 
(Fig.3). The data acquisition system is independent other system because the water 
temperature is required to measure for long time after the termination of the discharge 
until PFCs are cooled completely by water.   

 

3.  Estimation of the heat load from the increment of water temperature 

In this section, the estimation of the heat load from the increment of cooling water 
temperature is described. The following equation is used to calculate the heat load from

Equation (1) needs to measure water temperature until PFCs cooled completely. As 

the quite low temperature difference is difficult to measure, this makes the result 
undervalued. Poor cooling capability makes the low temperature difference for long 
time. As the result, the large error appears in the results. In fact, measuring until PFCs 
are cooled completely is difficult. On the other hand, the heat load can be estimated 
good accuracy when water temperature is steady state. Table 1 shows the flow rate of 
each PFC. 

When water temperature of the inlet is varied, the temperature change of PFCs due 
to the change of the temperature of cooling water takes place. In this case, PFCs work as 
the heat sink or source. The heat load estimated in this situation includes the heat

4.  Experimental results 

The typical wave form of 5 h 
discharge is shown as Fig.4. The 
fluctuation of water temperature of 
the VML and so on appears as shown 
in Fig.4. This is caused by the change 
of coupling between RF and plasma 
[7]. Here, the equation (2) can be used. 
The VML was inserted into plasma to 
remove the heat load effectively, 
therefore the last closed flux surface 
(LCFS) is decided by the VML. In 
this experiment, injected power which 
measured by corrected crystal diodes 
was 5710W and loss power at the 
launcher was estimated as 2220W by 
the increment of cooling water 
temperature and water flow rate. The 
estimated heat loads of each PFC are 
as the following.

The heat load to limiters is mainly caused by the two processes, 1) the particle and 
the heat flux diffusing from the core plasma to the LCFS, and 2) the fast electron direct 
loss. The affect of the radiation to the heat load of limiters can be neglected, because the 
surface area of limiters is less than 2% of the total surface area of all PFC. Heat flux to 
limiters from the SOL plasma can be estimated by the electron temperature, Te, and 
density, ne measured with a probe installed on the HML. To measure the profile of Te 
and ne, the HLM is inserted in several discharges, which are maintained by LH power of 
7.4 kW on corrected crystal diodes. Fig.5 shows the profile of Te and ne in the SOL 
region in this way. The head of the probe recedes 1 mm from the HML surface. The 
value of Te and ne do not change in the range of 5 mm and 7 mm despite the deep insert 
of the HML to the plasma. This indicates the head of the HML attaches to the LCFS. 
Thus the position of the LCFS can be decided in this way. The blue dotted curves show 
the fitted profile of electron density and temperature. The estimated heat flux to the 
HML derived from these data is 160W as referred in ref. [8]. The heat load to the VML 
is 590W, which include the heat load from the SOL plasma and the fast electron. The 
estimated value of the heat load from the SOL plasma is calculated as 350W by use of 
the profile of Te and ne. The heat load to the other fixed limiter is mainly coming from 
the SOL plasma and it is 1100W. The total heat load from the SOL plasma corresponds 
to 1450W.

In the 5 h discharge, only VML is inserted into the plasma. Net injected RF power is 
3.45 kW. Unfortunately plasma parameters in the SOL region are not measured in the 5 
h discharge. We assume that the heat load from the SOL plasma is proportional to net 
injected RF power. This assumption is tolerable as shown in ref [9]. Under this 
assumption, the heat load from the SOL plasma may be estimated as 700W. As the 
result, the power of the fast electron loss is 760W in the 5 h discharge.   

The fast electron accelerated by the microwave will be slowing down via the 
collision process. A part of fast electrons are sometimes scattered by the magnetic 
fluctuation and so on, and then they diffuse quickly to the LCFS. The orbit of the fast 
electron deviated from the flux surface. When the HML is attached to the LCFS, all of 
the fast electrons that located outside of the LCFS collides to the HML and the VML. 
As the result, power transferred by the direct loss of fast electrons can be measured as 
the heat load on the HML and the VML. The total heat load to the HML also includes 
from heat and the particle flux from the SOL plasma. Therefore the heat load from the 
SOL plasma should be subtracted from the total heat load to the HML in order to 
estimate the fast electron direct loss [10]. The total heat load to the VML and fixed 
limiters is 1460W. Therefore the direct loss power of the fast electron can be estimated 
as 1460-760=700W. The heat load to the vacuum vessel is caused by following 
processes, 1) radiation, 2) charge exchange (CX), 3) the particle and the heat flux from 
the core plasma via diffusion in the SOL region. The heat load via radiation will be 
deposited on the vacuum vessel and divertor plates, because radiation makes isotropic 
heat load and the vacuum vessel and divertor plates takes over all of area of PFCs. The 
heat deposition via CX process is similar to that of radiation but it is anisotropic because 
abundance of neutral particles is anisotropic. The cause of this inequality is attributable 
to the source of neutral particles. It is convenient that the distribution of Hα to estimate 
the localization of neutral particles. Fig.6 shows intensity of Hα [11]. 0 m of the 
abscissa axis corresponds to the location of the VML and a fixed limiter (No.1) of the 

80103

λλλλ=0.25-0.3m is assumed

toroidal direction and normalized by the 
intensity of this point. The location of 
intensity increasing exists to the limiter. 
It means that the limiters are source of 
neutral particle because they are exposed 
the SOL plasma.

measurement of water temperature on 
the vacuum vessel. Fig. 7(a) shows the 
time evolutions of the increment of water 
temperature of No.1 and No.4 part of the 
vacuum vessels. The resemblance of 
these waveforms indicates that the heat 
load and cooling capability is almost 
same. On the other hand, the waveforms 
concerning No.3 and No.6 parts show the 
difference in the reached temperature 
increment. No.1 and No.4 parts have the 
same structure in the view of relative 
distance from a fixed limiter. On the 
other hand, No.3 part surrounds VML and a fixed limiter but No.6 vacuum vessel 
includes no limiter. Therefore, it is conceivable that this difference of the waveform is 
caused by the heat flux from CX process. The difference of the heat load between No.3 
and No.6 parts are estimated 55 W. The direction of the No.3 vacuum vessel is 0 m to 
0.6 m and that of No.6 part is 2.5 m to 3.1 m on Fig.6. When the difference of the heat 
load from CX process between No.3 and No.6 parts are estimated by the difference of 
the intensity of Hα in each part quantitatively under the assumption that the CX flux is 
proportional to the intensity of Hα. This consideration gives the total heat load of CX 
and it is calculated as 175W.

5.  Total power balance of the long time operation 

From these results, power balance of the 5 h discharge can be estimated as below. 
Fig.8 shows the power balance of 5 h discharge. Power generated in 2.45GHz LHCD 
system (10260W) is lost in the launcher by damping (2220W) and reflected (4550W). 
Remaining power (5710W) is injected to the plasma. Although some power leaks 
(25W), and virtually power couples the fast electrons (3465W). Most of them give their 
energy by collisional slowing down on thermal electrons (2765W), and some of them 
collide to the VML as the direct loss of fast electron (700W). Energy to bulk plasma 
will be released via three processes, CX (175W), radiation (1730W) and diffusion 
(86W), respectively.

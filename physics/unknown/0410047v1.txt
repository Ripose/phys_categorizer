Abstract: Parallel permittivity elements are derived for RF waves in an axisymmetric D-shaped tokamak with 
Solov’ev type equilibrium. Drift-kinetic equation is solved separately for untrapped (passing or circulating) and 
three groups of trapped particles as a boundary-value problem, accounting for the bounce resonances. A 
coordinate system with the "straight" magnetic field lines is used.  Our dielectric permittivity elements are 
suitable to estimate the wave dissipation by electron Landau damping (e.g., during the plasma heating and 
current drive generation) in the frequency range of the Alfvén and fast magnetosonic waves, for both the large 
and low aspect ratio tokamaks with circular, elliptic and D-shaped magnetic surfaces. Dissipated wave power is 
expressed by the summation of terms including the imaginary parts of both the diagonal and non-diagonal 
elements of the parallel permittivity.  

 

 1. Introduction  

Spherical Tokamaks (or Low Aspect Ratio Tokamaks) represent a promising route to 
magnetic thermonuclear fusion [1-6]. To achieve fusion conditions in these devices additional 
plasma  heating  must  be  employed.  Effective  schemes  of  heating  and  current  drive  in 
tokamaks can be realised using the  collisionless dissipation of RF waves (e.g., Alfvén, Fast 
Magnetosonic and Lower Hybrid Waves) by  electron Landau damping, transit time magnetic 
pumping (TTMP),  cyclotron and bounce wave-particle interactions, etc. 

 Kinetic wave theory in any toroidal plasma should be based on the solution of Vlasov-
Maxwell's  equations  [7-15].  However,  this  problem  is  not  simple  even  in  the  scope  of  the 
linear theory since to solve the differential wave (or Maxwell's) equations one should use the 
complicated integral dielectric characteristics valid in the given frequency range for realistic 
two- or three-dimensional plasma models. The form of the dielectric (or wave conductivity) 
tensor  components, 
,  depends  substantially  on  the  geometry  of  an  equilibrium  magnetic 
field and, accordingly, on the chosen geometrical coordinates.

The  specific  toroidal  effects  arise  since  the  parallel  velocity  of  plasma  particles  in 
. As a result, 

tokamaks is not constant, 
-  depending on the pitch angle the plasma particles should be split in the populations of the 
trapped (t) and untrapped (u) particles;  
-  trajectories of t- and u-particles are different; 
-  Vlasov equation should be resolved separately for each particle group;  
-  the t- and u-particles give different contributions to 
-  the Cherenkov-resonance conditions of the t- and u-particles are different;  
-  wave dissipation by the  u-  and  t-particles depends on the ratio of 
- another interesting feature in tokamaks is the contribution of all spectrum of E-field to the 
m-th harmonic of the perturbed current density:

All  these  features  of  the  Large  Aspect  Ratio  Tokamaks  (r /R0<<1)  take  place  in  the 
 
Low  Aspect  Ratio  Toroidal  Plasmas  (r /R0<1)    with    circular  [16-18],    elliptic  [19],  and  D-
shaped  magnetic  surfaces  [20].    In  both  the  Large  and  Low  Aspect  Ratio  Tokamaks  with 
circular  magnetic  surfaces,  the  equilibrium  magnetic  field  has  only  one  minimum  (or  three 
extremums, with respect to the poloidal angle q  ). Accordingly, in such plasma models there 
is  only  one  group  of  trapped  particles.  The  main  feature  of  a  toroidal  plasma  with  elliptic

magnetic surfaces is the fact that the equilibrium magnetic field can have two local minimums 
(or  five  extremums,  with  respect  to  q   ).  As  a  result,  together  with  untrapped  and  usual  t-
trapped  particles,  two  additional  groups  of  the  so-called  d-trapped  (or  double-trapped) 
particles  can  appear  at  such  magnetic  surfaces  where  the  corresponding  criterion  [19]  is 
 , here  b/a  is the elongation, and  qh  is the poloidal component 
satisfied:

Many present-days tokamaks, mainly the spherical ones, have the D-shaped transverse 
cross-sections  of  the  magnetic  surfaces.  In  this  paper,  the  parallel  dielectric  permittivity 
elements  are  derived  for  RF  waves  in  an  axisymmetric  D-shaped  toroidal  plasma  with  a 
Solov’ev type equilibrium. A collisionless plasma model is considered. Drift-kinetic equation 
is solved separately for untrapped and three groups of trapped particles as a boundary-value 
problem, using an approach developed for low aspect ratio tokamaks with concentric circular 
[18], elliptic [19] and D-shaped [20] magnetic surfaces.

D-shaped  transverse  magnetic  surface  cross-sections  corresponding  to  the  Solov’ev 
type equilibrium [21, 22], see Fig.1, can be plotted by the following parametric equations for

Now  let  us  verify  how  many  minimums  can  have  H0(r,q

)  in  dependence  of  the 
poloidal angle q  at the given by r  magnetic surfaces. The corresponding plots are present in 
Fig. 2 for tokamaks with elliptic (b/a=2.5, d/a=0, r  =0.5) and D-shaped (b/a=2.5, d/a=0.3,   
)- configurations 
r  =0.5) magnetic surfaces. As shown in Fig.2, plasma tends to have H0(r,q
)  (and,  accordingly, 
with  one  minimum.  Configurations  with  two  minimums  of  H0(r,q
additional  groups  of  the  trapped  particles)  can  appear  in  elongated  tokamaks  with  a  high 
elongation  b/a > 2  and high central b o . Of course, the preferable regimes-configurations are 
),  since  the  new-additional  groups  of  the  trapped 
those  with  the  one  minimum  of  H0(r,q
particles can provoke the additional plasma-wave instabilities, modify the transport processes 
and so on.

      Note that we have derived the contribution of any kind of u- and t-particles to the parallel 
permittivity  elements.  The  corresponding  expressions  for  plasma  electrons  and  ions  can  be 
obtained replacing  T, N, M, e  by the electron Te, Ne, me, ee  and ion  Ti, Ni, Mi, ei parameters, 
respectively.  To obtain the total expressions of the dielectric permittivity elements, as usual, 
it is necessary to carry out the summation over the all species of plasma particles.  

6. Wave Dissipation by Electron Landau Damping 
One of the main mechanisms of the RF plasma heating is the electron Landau damping 
||E  with the trapped and untrapped 
of waves due to the Cherenkov resonance interaction of 
electrons.    Here  we  should  take  into  account  that  the  Cherenkov  resonance  conditions  are 
different for trapped and untrapped particles in tokamak plasmas and have nothing in common 
with  the  wave-particle  resonance  conditions  in  the  cylindrical  magnetised  plasmas.  Another 
mE -harmonics to 
important feature of the 2D tokamak plasmas is the contributions of the all 
mj|| -harmonic, see Eq. (26). As a result, after averaging in time and poloidal angle, 
can  be

Conclusion 

Our  dielectric  characteristics  can  be  applied  for  both  the  large  and  low  aspect  ratio 
tokamaks with circular, elliptic and D-shaped magnetic surfaces to study the wave processes 
with  a  regular  frequency  such  as  the  wave  propagation  and  wave  dissipation  during  the 
plasma heating and current drive generation; when the wave frequency has been done, e.g., by

the  antenna-generator  system,  in  the  frequency  range  of  the  Alfvén  and  fast  magnetosonic 
waves.   

Analysing the collisionless wave dissipation by plasma particles we should remember  
the other kinetic mechanisms of the wave-particle interactions, such as TTMP (Transit Time 
Magnetic  Pumping)  and  cyclotron  resonance  damping.  Those  can  be  described  by  the 
transverse and cross-off dielectric permittivity elements. A comprehensive theoretical analysis 
of  the  kinetic  wave  dissipation  should  be  developed  using  all  nine  dielectric  tensor 
components,  accounting  for  the  finite  particle-orbit  widths,  the  finite  beta,  and  the  finite 
Larmor  radius  effects.  These  corrections  can  be  derived  by  solving  the  Vlasov  equation  for 
trapped  and  untrapped  particles  in  the  next  approximation(s)  over  the  magnetisation 
parameter.  However, this is a topic for additional investigation.

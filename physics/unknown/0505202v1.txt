Abstract 
The quantum yield of synthetic eumelanin is known to be extremely low and it has recently been 
reported to be dependent on excitation wavelength. In this paper, we demonstrate the exact nature of 
this wavelength-dependence, presenting quantum yield as a function of excitation wavelength between 
250 and 500 nm.  In addition, we present a definitive map of the steady-state fluorescence as a function 
of excitation and emission wavelengths, and significantly, a three-dimensional map of the “specific 
quantum yield”: the fraction of photons absorbed at each wavelength that are subsequently radiated at 
each emission wavelength. This important quantity allows us to track the decay pathways of photons 
absorbed at UV and visible wavelengths. This information is important in the context of understanding 
melanin biofunctionality, and the quantum molecular biophysics therein. 
 
 
Introduction 
Eumelanin is a biological pigment found in 
many species (including humans). In the human 
body, it is known to act as a photoprotectant in 
the skin and eyes,1 a function derived both from 
its strong absorption throughout the UV and 
visible wavelengths (Fig. 1) and from its low 
quantum yield. Paradoxically, eumelanin 
precursors have also been implicated as 
photosensitisers leading to the development of 
melanoma skin cancer.2, 3 The chemical 
properties of eumelanin are therefore a topic of 
intense scientific interest;4-6  in particular, an 
understanding of the radiative and non-
radiative de-excitation processes of eumelanin 
is critical to unlocking its role with respect to 
melanoma, and understanding these processes 
is a key goal of many groups, including ours. 

incident beam) and strong reabsorption of the 
emission, even at very low concentrations. 
Since eumelanin absorbs very strongly and its 
absorption profile is exponential in nature, 
these effects distort the spectra significantly. 
However, a correction method has recently 
been used to successfully recover the actual 
eumelanin emission spectra11 and excitation 
spectra12 at several excitation and emission 
wavelengths respectively.  The first study 
clearly showed that eumelanin emission is 
dependent upon excitation wavelength, as 
increases in excitation wavelength red-shifted 
the emission peak and reduced its intensity. In 
order to determine the limits of this effect, we 
report here a significant extension of that 
preliminary study: a complete set of emission 
and excitation spectra for synthetic eumelanin 
at 1 nm intervals over the entire visible and UV 
range. We believe this to be the most complete 
study of the steady-state fluorescence of 
eumelanin to date. As such, we hope it can act 

Eumelanin fluorescence has been 
extensively studied over the past three decades; 
however, much of the reported literature is 
inconclusive and inconsistent.7-10 This is in part 
due to the inner filter effect (attenuation of the

as a reference point for further spectroscopic 
studies. 

Further to this, we provide a complete 
description of the dependence of the radiative 
quantum yield on excitation wavelength. The 
quantum yield of eumelanin has been shown to 
be 18% lower for 410 nm excitation than for 
350 nm excitation;13 this is an unusual 
characteristic among fluorophores. This study 
provides quantum yield values for all excitation 
wavelengths between 250 and 500 nm. In this 
effort, we report a quantity that we call the 
“specific quantum yield” for eumelanin.  This 
is the fraction of photons absorbed at a specific 
excitation wavelength that are emitted at a 
specific emission wavelength and can be 
depicted for all excitation and emission 
wavelengths in a three-dimensional “quantum 
yield map”. Note that the traditional quantum 
yield is given by the integral of the specific 
quantum yield over emission wavelengths. For 
a molecule with complex energy dissipation 
processes and broad spectroscopic features 
such as eumelanin, the specific quantum yield 
is a valuable parameter for spectroscopic 
analysis. Even for compounds whose quantum 
yield exhibits no wavelength-dependence, the 
specific quantum yield is valuable for 
spectroscopic studies as it represents the 
emission distribution normalised to absorption.

volume, with respect to excitation and 
emission beam width. 

In addition to reporting the specific quantum 
yield map for eumelanin, we present the 
general method for determination of the 
specific quantum yield for any compound. 
 
Methods 
Calculations 
We seek to determine the relationship between 
the specific quantum yield values, defined as 
the fraction of photons absorbed at each 
excitation wavelength (λex) that are emitted at 
each emission wavelength (λem), and the 
excitation and emission wavelengths. If we take 
as a typical measurement geometry the 
configuration shown in Fig. 2, then a small 
volume is defined in the centre of the cuvette 
by the slit widths for the incoming and 
outgoing beams.  This is the volume from 
which fluorescence is detected, given the 
instrumental design. We define: 
Na(λex) = Total number of photons absorbed in 
the central volume 
Ne(λex, λem) = Total number of photons emitted 
from the central volume 
The specific quantum yield, as a function of λex 
and λem is then defined as:

the sample (which are significant not only for 
eumelanin but also for common quantum yield 
standards such as quinine14), a correction has 
been applied to the raw spectra,13 prior to 
determination of the quantum yield. The value

The above equations for the quantum yield are 
equivalent to standard methods provided in the 
literature.15 Note that typically, the ratio of 
integrated emission to absorption coefficient α 
is used, whereas the present discussion uses the 
ratio of integrated emission to 1-e-αd. The 
former ratio is based upon the approximation e-
αd=1-αd, which is not valid for the large 
absorption coefficient values of melanin at low 
wavelengths (less than 300 nm). For more 
precise results, we have measured the 
absorbance and emission of the standard 
solution for several different concentrations and 
plotted the expression in Eq. 8 for thirty 
concentrations (Fig. 3). 1/C is then given by the 
gradient of a linear regression. 
 
Sample Preparation: 
Synthetic eumelanin derived by the 
nonenzymatic oxidation of tyrosine was 
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, 
Australia) and used without further purification. 
The powder was diluted to 0.003% by weight 
in high purity 18.2 MΩ MilliQ de-ionised 
water. This concentration was selected to 
maximise fluorescence, while minimising re-
absorption and inner filter effects (the 
correction for these effects has been shown to 
be effective at this concentration; at higher 
concentrations, scattering effects reduce the 
accuracy of the correction13).  To aid solubility, 
the solution was adjusted to pH 12 using

correction. Spectra were pre-corrected to 
account for differences in pump beam power at 
different excitation wavelengths using a 
reference beam.  All emission spectra were 
corrected for reabsorption and inner filter 
effects using the method outlined previously.13 
Quantum yields were calculated using the 
method outlined above with standard values.14 
Since the quantum yield of quinine is 
temperature-dependent, the ambient 
temperature surrounding the cuvette was 
measured to be 35(cid:176) C, resulting in a 2.5% shift 
from the published value of 0.546. 
 
Results and Discussion 
The fluorescence map for synthetic eumelanin 
is shown as a function of two variables in Fig. 
4a as both a three-dimensional projection and a 
contour map. The first- and second-order 
Rayleigh peaks have been removed from the 
spectra manually, and the first- and second-
order Raman bands were removed by 
background subtraction in the correction 
procedure (which accounted for probe 
attenuation and emission reabsorption). The 
fluorescence map reveals an elongated peak 
near λex=260, λem=450 nm with a small shoulder 
centred around λex =310nm, λem = 440nm. 
Virtually no emission is observed at emission 
wavelengths shorter than 380nm, or longer than 
600nm, regardless of the excitation wavelength. 
The lack of emission beyond 600 nm has been 
previously reported for excitation wavelengths 
between 360 and 380 nm as a low energy tail in 
the emission spectra that is constant with 
excitation energy (in shape and magnitude).13 
The present data show that this feature is 
maintained for a much broader range of 
excitation wavelengths. 

Single excitation spectra extracted from 

these maps for emission wavelengths of 450, 
490, 530, and 570 nm (Fig 4b) are identical to 
individually measured excitation spectra 
corrected for reabsorption.12 Extracted emission 
spectra also coincided with those reported 
previously (Fig. 4c).11 A small isosbestic point

(Sigma-Aldrich) was used without further 
purification at thirty different concentrations 
(1x10-6 M to 1x10-4 M in 1 N H2SO4 solution) 
as a standard for the determination of the 
radiative quantum yield. 
 
Spectroscopy: 
Absorbance spectra were recorded using a 
Perkin Elmer Lambda 40 spectrophotometer 
with a 240 nm/min scan speed and 2 nm 
bandpass. All spectra were collected using a 1 
cm square quartz cuvette. Solvent scans 
(obtained under identical conditions) were used 
for background correction. 

Fluorescence emission spectra for 
eumelanin and fluorescein were recorded using 
a Jobin Yvon Fluoromax 3 fluorimeter with a 3 
nm bandpass and an integration time of 0.5 s.  
Matrix scanning software allowed excitation 
and emission intervals of 1 nm.  Solvent scans 
were again performed under identical 
instrumental conditions for background

the emission spectra at λem=450 nm (Fig 4d) for 
excitation wavelengths between 300 and 315 
nm. While existence of an isosbestic point has 
been previously reported for eumelanin at an 
emission wavelength of 470 nm,7 we believe 
this to be a different phenomenon. In that study, 
the excitation wavelengths used there were 
between 340 and 400, and the shapes of the 
measured spectra differed substantially from 
those observed here, particularly at shorter 
wavelengths. Moreover, that isosbestic point

chemical species, whose relative emissions 
varied with excitation wavelength, in some 
reaction equilibrium. In contrast, we believe 
ours to reflect a model of eumelanin as an 
ensemble of chemically distinct species (these 
may be oligomeric or polymeric), each with a 
slightly different HOMO-LUMO (highest 
occupied molecular orbital – lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbital) gap energy. According to 
this model, it is possible that excitation at 300 

 

6 

nm excites more of the low-HOMO-LUMO 
gap populations and less of the high-gap 
populations than excitation at 315 nm, resulting 
in an isosbestic point. Note that this small range 
of excitation wavelengths marks a transition 
point in eumelanin fluorescence. As the 
excitation wavelength increases from 270 nm to 
300 nm, emission intensities decrease steadily 
at all wavelengths greater than 400 nm. 
Similarly, as the excitation wavelength 
increases from 315 nm to higher wavelengths, 
emission intensities again decrease steadily at 
all wavelengths.

absorption should intuitively lead to greater 
fluorescence; from Fig. 1, we observe that 
absorbance increases monotonically towards 
higher energies. However, the fluorescence 
map clearly demonstrates that this does not lead 
to monotonic increase in fluorescence (Fig. 4). 
Thus, the quantum yield is significantly 
dependent on excitation wavelength, and the 
specific quantum yield can provide insight into 
the decay pathways of absorbed photons not

the probability that an absorbed photon will be 
re-emitted at a particular wavelength. Note that

absorption at all wavelengths shorter than 375 
nm). As the excitation energy increases from 
2.5 eV (500 nm) to 4.1 eV (300 nm), the peak 
specific quantum yield also shifts 
correspondingly to increasing emission 
energies, suggesting that chemical species with 
larger HOMO-LUMO gaps are preferentially 
excited. However, this trend does not continue 
for excitation energies higher than 4.1 eV; the 
peak yield is at a constant emission energy of 
approximately 2.7 eV.  

The traditional quantum yield for 

eumelanin was calculated as described above, 
and is shown to be very low (on the order of 10-
3), agreeing with values previously determined 
(Fig. 6).13 This indicates strong coupling of 
electronic excited states to vibrational modes of 
the system (i.e. strong electron-phonon 
coupling), which is of course a highly desirable 
feature for a photoprotectant. Moreover, it 
exhibits a complex dependence on wavelength 
and confirms the relative quantum yield values 
at 350, 380, and 410 nm previously reported. 
The maximum yield of 0.0022 occurs at an 
excitation energy of 4.58 eV (271 nm). Two 
other features are worth pointing out. First, the 

While the fluorescence map showed a 
single, elongated band with a small shoulder, 
the quantum yield map shows two distinct 
elongated bands of comparable intensity. The 
saddle between these peaks occurs at an 
excitation energy of 4.2 eV (296 nm).  This 
indicates that non-radiative decay processes are 
more significant for excitation at 4.2 eV than 
the surrounding energies, perhaps due to 
stronger electron-phonon coupling in the 
chemical species excited in this range. The 
specific quantum yield is almost negligible for 
all emission energies lower than 2.1 eV 
(wavelengths longer than 590 nm) and greater 
than 3.3 eV (shorter than 375 nm). This lack of 
fluorescence suggests that there are no 
transitions with these energy difference along 
which the molecule will decay (although note 
that this does not indicate a lack of transitions 
at those energies, since there is significant

quantum yield is approximately constant 
between excitation energies of 4.2 and 3.4 eV 
(295 and 360 nm). Second, the decrease in 
quantum yield with decreasing excitation 
energy between 3.4 and 2.5 eV (365 and 500 
nm) is remarkably linear. 

These data help to explain the isosbestic 

mentioned above. While the area under the 
emission spectra between emission 
wavelengths of 350 and 600 nm is not constant 
for excitation wavelengths between 295 and 
320 nm, the area under the specific quantum 
yield plots (shown as the traditional quantum 
yield) is constant. This indicates that the 
isosbestic point is likely due to selective 
excitation of different populations, but the 
much higher absorbance at shorter wavelengths 
results in greater excitation of the 
corresponding population. The abrupt changes 
in behaviour at 4.2 eV and at 3.6 eV also 
indicate that there are fundamental shifts in the 
eumelanin decay processes at those energies – 
perhaps due to excitation to orbitals higher than 
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital or 
changes in aggregation patterns resulting in 
altered vibronic states. 

The traditional quantum yield is 
typically constant with excitation wavelength 
(and is usually quoted as a single value for a 
particular substance).  This is clearly not the 
case for eumelanin; the yield varies by a factor 
of 5 over the range 250 nm to 500 nm.  Our 
method for determining the traditional yield has 
allowed us to plot it as a function of the 
excitation energy, and fully characterise the 
yield over the UV and visible range.  The yield 
decreases with excitation energy, indicating 
that lower energy electronic states in eumelanin 
couple more effectively to vibrational modes 
and hence result in greater non-radiative decay. 
It is clear that non-radiative decay 
processes are very important for eumelanin, as 
would be expected for a photoprotectant.  By 
accurately quantifying the radiative and non-
radiative decay pathways for eumelanin we 
hope to understand how it fulfills its biological 

We have presented the most 

functions so effectively, and maybe also gain a 
better understanding of the photochemical and 
photophysical processes that lead to melanoma 
skin cancer. 
 
Conclusion: 
 
comprehensive study of steady-state eumelanin 
fluorescence to date for UV and visible 
wavelengths, correcting for attenuation and 
reabsorption effects. These data demonstrate 
upper and lower bounds on emission that are 
independent of excitation wavelength between 
250 and 500 nm. Moreover, we have 
introduced a new parameter, the “specific 
quantum yield”, which characterises the 
radiative (and non-radiative) decay properties 
of eumelanin more completely than emission or 
excitation spectra alone. Finally, we 
demonstrate that the traditional quantum yield 
is extremely low (on the order of 10-3) and 
highly dependent on wavelength between 250 
and 500 nm excitation. We hope that these data 
will serve as a reference point for further 
spectroscopic studies.

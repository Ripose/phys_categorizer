ABSTRACT  :  We  present  an  algorithm  for  focusing  inversion  of  electrical  resistivity 
tomography (ERT) data. ERT is a typical example of ill-posed problem. Regularization is the 
most  common  way  to  face  this  kind  of  problems;  it  basically  consists  in  using  a  priori 
information about targets to reduce the ambiguity and the instability of the solution. By using 
the  minimum  gradient  support  (MGS)  stabilizing  functional,  we  introduce  the  following 
geometrical prior information in the reconstruction process: anomalies have sharp boundaries. 

The  presented  work  is  embedded  in  a  project  (L.A.R.A.)  which  aims  at  the  estimation  of 
hydrogeological  properties  from  geophysical  investigations.  L.A.R.A.  facilities  include  a 
simulation tank (4 m x 8 m x 1.35 m); 160 electrodes are located all around the tank and used 
for 3-D ERT. Because of the large number of electrodes and their dimensions, it is important 
to model their effect in order to correctly evaluate the electrical system response. The forward 
modelling in the presented algorithm is based on the so-called complete electrode model that 
takes into account the presence of the electrodes and their contact impedances. 

In this paper, we compare the results obtained with different regularizing functionals applied 
on a synthetic model.

1. Introduction 

ERT is a very widely used technique: its applications go from mining exploration to detection 
and mapping of subsurface contaminant plumes. To determine the resistivity distribution from 
measurements of potential differences is a non-unique problem and its numerical solution is 
unstable:  small  variations  in  the  data  can  cause  large  variations  in  the  solution.  Commonly 
used  inversion  methods  provide  unique  and  stable  solutions  by  introducing  the  appropriate 
stabilizing  functional  (stabilizer).  The  main  aim  of  the  stabilizer  is  to  incorporate  a  priori 
knowledge  in  the  inversion  process.  Over  the  last  decade  several  different  stabilizers  have 
been  introduced  (Zhdanov,  2002).  These  new  stabilizers  permit  reconstruction  of  blocky 
structures  with  abrupt  change  of  properties.  They  generate  clearer  and  more  focused  images 
of the anomalies than the conventional maximum smoothness functionals. For example, it was 
shown  that  the  minimum  support  (MS)  functional  can  be  very  useful  in  the  solution  of 
different  geophysical  inverse  problems  (Portniaguine  and  Zhdanov,  1999;  Vignoli  and 
Zhdanov, 2004; Vignoli and Zanzi, 2005). This particular functional selects the desired stable 
solution with the following characteristic: anomalies have sharp boundaries. In this work, we

apply  a  special  version  of  MS  stabilizer,  the  MGS  functional,  to  ERT  on  a  finite  volume 
(Blaschek,  2005).  Moreover  we  compare  MGS  solution  with  the  results  provided, 
respectively,  by  the  more  traditional  minimum  norm  (MN)  and  the  total  variation  (TV) 
stabilizers. 
We  simulate  to  collect  our  data  over  a  finite  volume  (a  tank,  as  in  Fig.  1,  representing 
L.A.R.A.  facility)  surrounded  by  an  insulator  medium  (the  tank  lining  and  the  air).  In  our 
synthetic  model  (Fig.  2),  we  imagine  to  deal  with  a  large  number  of  electrodes  (96)  with 
significant  dimensions  (0.15  m  x  0.15  m).  For  all  this  reasons,  we  have  to  model  also  the 
electrodes effect. The forward modelling in the presented algorithm is based on the so-called 
complete  electrode  model  that  takes  into  account  the  presence  of  the  electrodes  and  their 
contact impedances. The advantages of this model are that it accounts for the fact that current 
is  applied  through  electrodes,  which  are  discrete  and  are  high  conductive  shortcuts  for  the 
current;  moreover,  it  does  not  ignore  the  effect  of  the  contact  impedance  and  the  fact  that 
injected current density is not constant at all at electrode-object interfaces. 

2. ERT forward and inverse problem  
2.1. Complete electrodes model 
ERT consists of using electrodes (metal stakes knocked into the earth or, as in our case, plates 
attached  on  the  surface  of  an  object)  to  inject  direct  electric  current  into  the  ground  and 
measure  the  corresponding  electrical  potential  at  the  surface.  The  measured  data  depend  on 
the spatial distribution of electrical conductivity (the parameter). The process which maps the 
parameter  to  the  measured  data  (the  forward  mapping)  depends  nonlinearly  on  the 
conductivity distribution. 
To model the physical system, we made the following assumptions: 1) the investigated object 
is  linear  (i.e.,  the  physical  properties  are  independent  on  applied  field  strength);  2)  the 
medium is microscopically isotropic; 3) electrodes are perfect conductors on the surface of the 
investigated  object,  which  is  embedded  in  an  insulator  medium.  We  have  adopted  the 
complete  electrode  model  (Polydorides,  2002):  on  one  hand,  it  takes  into  account  that  the 
thl electrode is equal to the sum of the potential on the boundary 
actual measured potential at 
surface  underneath  the  electrode  and  the  potential  drop  across  the  electrode  contact 
resistance
;  on  the  other  hand,  it  models  the  shunting effect of the electrodes, i.e., the metal 
electrodes  themselves  provide  a  low  resistance  path  for  current  (Fig.  3a).  Moreover, 
differently  from  what  it  is  usually  assumed,  the  current  density  is  far  from  being  constant 
                                                 
  Contact  resistance  is  due  to  a  common  electrochemical  effect  that  may  take  place at the contact between the 
electrode and the object. It consists in the formation of a thin resistive layer between the electrode and the object; 
it vanishes when the electrode is in touch with an ohmic conductor.

underneath  electrodes  (Fig.  3);  thus,  instead  of  imposing  a  condition  on  the  current  density, 
we use a weaker condition on the total injected current.

is  proportional  to  the  difference  between  the  model  m   and  an  appropriate  a  priori  model

3. Comparison of different stabilizer inversion 

Let us compare inversion results obtained using the three stabilizers discussed overleaf (Fig. 
5, 6, 7). We imagine to “collect” synthetic data using the electrode configuration depicted in 
Fig. 2. Electrodes are imagined to be placed on the surface of L.A.R.A. simulation tank. The 
true model (Fig. 4) consists of two anomalies: respectively 20% more (the red one) and less 
(the blue one) resistive than background. Detecting them is particularly difficult because they 
partially  shield  each  other.  MGS  generates  the  best  result:  its  reconstruction  is  sharper  than 
TV  solution; 
(e.g.,  see  slices  at 
@z
in  Fig,  7  and  compare  them  with  the corresponding planes in Fig. 5 
and 6.); besides, MGS provides a quite reliable estimation of the correct resistivity value.

4. Conclusion 

Stabilization  of  inversion  methods  with  smoothing  functionals  can  result  in  oversmoothed 
reconstruction of object properties (Fig. 5). We suggest the use of the  MGS
 to preserve 
sharp features in inverted models. However, it is evident that using MGS provides even better 
images of blocky targets when prior information about the anomalies is available; the example 
shows that this stabilizer can also identify the right resistivity values. 
The importance of complete electrode model sophistication will be evaluated when real data 
of L.A.R.A. facility will be available. In any case, because of the large number of electrodes 
and their dimensions, it seems very important not to neglect their influence.

The treatment found on most general optics textbooks related to the phase contrast 

technique imposes limitations on the filter phase and object phase variations in order to 

mathematically explain it in a simple manner. We consider that this simplified treatment 

can be misleading in terms of the concept the student may develop and also about the 

potential applications of the phase contrast technique. In this paper we describe a broader 

and yet simple explanation of the phase contrast process, creating a parallelism between 

optical image processing and interferometry.

INTRODUCTION 

Phase objects alter the phase but not the amplitude of the incident light, for example 

thermal variations in air. Typical detection systems are ineffective in the analysis of such 

objects since the eye, CCD cameras, photomultipliers and other light detection devices 

are sensitive only to variations in intensity and not phase.  

Phase objects are of variations in thickness, refractive index or combinations of these, 

leading to a variation in optical thickness of the object. The method suggested by 

Zernike1,  known as Phase Contrast Technique, for which he was awarded the Nobel 

1

 

   

 

 

 

Prize in 1953, converts phase modulation caused by the object into amplitude 

modulation. In the case of weak phase objects, this conversion is performed such that 

phase variations map linearly to amplitude variation in the image field thus rendering an 

image depicting the variation of optical thickness of a phase object. 

In most classical textbooks related to general optics 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  the treatment found on the 

phase contrast technique is based on two important conditions. The first is related to the 

filter phase, always set to π/2 rad. The second is concerned with the object phase 

variations allowed, always limited to be smaller than 0.1 rad. These conditions are 

required in order to describe the system in a simplified manner. However, we consider 

that the simplified treatment can be reformulated in terms of the concept that the student 

may develop about the technique and the potential applications of the phase contrast 

technique. In this paper we describe a broader and yet simple explanation of the phase 

contrast process. The description presented herein is adequate for courses in which 

optical information processing is the main subject. This alternative way of teaching phase 

contrast gives the student a better understanding of the topic, provides a parallelism with 

interferometry and opens a broader view on its applications. 

We begin by giving a review on the phase contrast method as presented in general optics 

textbooks. Then we present an alternative approach, in which no limitations are imposed 

on either the filter phase or the amplitude of the object phase variations. Finally some 

conclusions are drawn.

Simplified treatment 

The phase contrast technique is employed to retrieve the phase information. The most 

widely used textbooks on general optics devote some part of a chapter to this problem. 

Two important considerations are made. One is that the filter phase, which only alters the 

object’s zero frequency spectral component, is restricted to a value of ±π/2 rad. The 

second one is that the object phase variations, Φ(x,y), are small (less than 0.1 rad). The 

phase function, exp[i(Φ(x,y))], where the average phase shift through the object has been 

omitted, is expressed as a Taylor series. Using the first assumption, the object phase 

function expansion is left with its first two expansion terms (1+ iΦ(x,y)).  Since Φ(x,y) 

represents variations around the average phase shift, it has no energy at the zero 

frequency spectral component. Therefore, the filtering process only alters the constant 

term of the object phase function approximation. Consequently, at the image plane both 

the constant term and the phase distribution Φ(x,y) are imaginary functions (i + iΦ(x,y)). 

Calculating the intensity distribution at the image plane, where the term Φ2(x,y)  has been 

neglected based on the assumption that Φ(x,y) is small, yields I(x,y)=1±2 Φ(x,y). Using 

this simplified explanation a linear relationship between intensity at the image plane and 

the object phase distribution is found.  

General treatment 

The phase contrast method can be explained with a treatment without the two 

abovementioned restrictive conditions. For simplicity, we present a one-dimensional 

treatment, however the generalization to two-dimensional structures is straightforward.

(2) 

This simple form of the filter function states that the phase filter can be interpreted as the 

sum of two filters: one that leaves the object spectrum unaltered and one that only alters 

the zero frequency component and blocks the rest of the spectrum.  

To implement the phase contrast technique consider a 4f optical system with a 

monochromatic plane wave with unitary amplitude used to illuminate the phase object 

located at the input plane. This is an imaging system with unitary magnification and a 

Fourier plane where the input object Fourier transform and the field distribution are 

proportionally related (figure 1).  

Considering a general phase object described by f(x)=exp[iΘ(x)], where Θ(x) can take 

any value, the field distribution at the intermediate Fourier plane produced by the first

Expression (3) is the superposition of two terms: the information of the phase object (first

coherent sources. The second lens and the detection process makes them interfere, 

therefore one could think of the phase contrast system as an interferometer in which the 

phase filter acts as a point source. This is known as a common path interferometer10.

In order to analyze the expression for the field distribution at the image plane (4) without 

restricting the treatment to the textbook small phase variations on the object or a filter 

phase equal to ±π/2 rad, we consider the cases of small and large object phase variations 

without restriction on the phase filter value.

Small phase variations   

Let us first consider an object with small phase variations Φ(x,y) around an average 

constant phase. The average constant phase represents a uniform phase delay throughout 

the object domain. If we are not interested in measuring absolute values for the phase 

variations, then the constant phase delay can be neglected. Also, the term F0 can be made 

equal to 1 and, as such, it does not affect the argument of the cosine function, i.e., θFo=0 

in expressions (4) and (5). The filter phase α plays an important role regarding the linear 

relationship between intensity and the object phase distribution, as it can be observed in 

expressions (4) and (5). A graph of the sine function with argument α/2 between 0 and 

π/2 rad (figure 2) aids to show that a filter phase different from α =±π/2 rad can be 

employed and still get a linear relationship between the interferogram intensity and the 

small phase distribution. In order to show that expression (4) reduces to the linear 

relationship described in textbooks we consider the example of a filter phase equal to π/2 

rad. To demonstrate that a linear relationship can be obtained for other filter phases we 

consider the case of a filter phase equal to π/4 rad. 

For the general case of small phase variations and a positive filter phase, expression (4) 

π/2 rad phase filter (Zernike filter)  

can be written as:

This is the same result using the simplified analysis of the system. The analysis is in

where a linear relationship between interferogram intensities and phase variations is 

obtained under the small object phase approximation. 

Arbitrary phase filter  

Any filter phase different from π/2 rad can produce a linear relationship between the 

phase distribution and the interferogram intensity. However, there is a tradeoff involved 

in modifying the π/2 rad Zernike filter phase.

Taking |Φmax| as the object’s maximum phase variation, considered small, we calculate 

the extreme intensities using (4) and (5); these are Imax and Imin, the maximum and 

minimum interferogram intensities, respectively.

To evaluate the performance of the phase contrast apparatus we assess the image contrast 

defined as C=(Imax-Imin)/(Imax+Imin). Using trigonometric identities and keeping in mind 

that |Φmax| is small, the contrast is given by 

Φ=C

2 max α
)

sin(

. 

(10) 

(11) 

The contrast reaches its maximum value for the π/2 rad filter phase (see figure 3). If we 

employ a phase filter larger than π/2 rad, the maximum phase variations under which a 

linear relationship could be obtained would be reduced and tend to zero as the phase filter 

approaches π rad (see figure 2). 

Large phase variations 

From figure 2, one might be tempted to think that a linear relationship could be obtained 

between larger phase variations and intensity by using a phase filter smaller than π/2 rad. 

However, for these larger phase variations the term F0 can not be made equal to one and 

is rather object dependent. Therefore, although a linear relationship between phase 

distribution and intensity indeed exists, it can not be determined.  

 

 

 

8

Hence, in general, when we do not restrict the object phase variations to be small a 

nonlinear relationship is obtained between phase variations and output intensity, just like 

in a classical interferometer. The term F0 turns into a complex number, inducing an 

unknown constant term in the argument of the cosine function. Nevertheless, numerical 

techniques can be applied to the resulting interferogram in order to retrieve the object 

phase distribution. Furthermore, the filter phase value is no longer restricted; it can be 

any number different from zero or 2π multiples. In this case, the filter phase plays an 

important role on the interferogram contrast. 

Conclusions 

The treatment found on most general optics textbooks imposes limitations on the filter 

phase and object phase variations in order to mathematically explain the phase contrast 

technique. Such limitations are justified when time is a constraint. However the more 

general approach we propose here can enhance the understanding the student may 

develop of such a system. The general treatment we propose requires some basic 

concepts regarding Fourier optics, which are also required in the classical treatment. 

Finally, we consider that learning the phase contrast technique with the general treatment 

presented here opens up a wider variety of applications in the students mind either for 

small of large phase variations objects and help in making an analogy between optical 

image processing and interferometry.

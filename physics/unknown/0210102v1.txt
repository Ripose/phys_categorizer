Abstract 

A  Large  Area  Avalanche  Photodiode  (LAAPD)  was  studied,  aiming  to  access  its 

performance as light detector at low temperatures, down to –80ºC. 

The excess noise factor, F, was measured and found to be approximately independent 

of  the  temperature.  A  linear  dependence  of  F  on  the  APD  gain  with  a  slope  of 

0.00239±0.00008 was observed for gains >100. 

The  detection  of  low  intensity  light  pulses,  producing  only  a  few  primary 

electron-hole pairs in the photodiode, is reported.

1. Introduction 

Large Area Avalanche Photodiodes (LAAPD) are of great interest for high efficiency 

detection of low intensity light pulses from scintillators. In spite of some drawbacks, 

they can compete successfully with photomultiplier tubes (PMT) in many applications 

that require very compact detector packaging (in Positron Emission Tomography, for 

instance),  low  sensitivity  to  magnetic  fields  (as  in  some  space  applications  and 

accelerator  experiments)  or  low  intrinsic  radioactivity  as  required  for  the  low 

background  experiments  (e.g.,  search  of  dark  matter).    Very  good  time  and  energy 

resolutions  have  been  achieved  with  LAAPDs  with  various  scintillators,  namely 

inorganic crystals [1, 2] and liquid xenon [3]. 

Operation  at  low  temperature  can  be  not  only  a  necessity,  as  in  the  case  of  liquid 

xenon  [3],  but  also  a  favorable  option.  In  fact,  to  operate  the  LAAPD  at  low 

temperature  has  two  advantageous  effects:  1)  the  dark  current  noise  decreases 

dramatically; 2) the voltage required to achieve a certain gain becomes lower. In our 

previous  work  [4],  both  effects  were  investigated  as  a  function  of the temperature 

between 25 ºC and -100 ºC.  

In a detector with a LAAPD readout, the noise and the fluctuations of the avalanche 

gain contribute to the energy resolution of the system. The later is usually expressed 

in  terms  of  the  excess  noise  factor,  F,  [5].  Previous  measurements  of  the  energy 

resolution  in  liquid  xenon  excited  with  alpha-particles  [3],  indicated  a  value  of  F 

significantly larger than the value usually reported for room temperature. 

In this paper, we report on measurements of the  excess noise factor as a function of 

the gain at low temperatures (down to  –80ºC). The observation of very low intensity 

light pulses that produce only a few primary electron-hole pairs in the photodiode is 

also presented.

2. Experimental Set-Up 

In  our  measurements  we  used  a  windowless  LAAPD,  5  mm  in  diameter,  from 

Advanced  Photonix,  Inc  [6].  This  photodiode,  manufactured  using  beveled-edge 

technology, has low dark current and relatively small capacitance (typically, about 30 

nA and 25 pF, respectively, at room temperature and a gain of 200). 

The  set-up used for the measurements is schematically depicted in Fig. 1. The APD 

connected  to  a  low-noise  charge  sensitive  preamplifier  (Cremat  CR-101D)  was 

mounted inside a metallic cage and placed into a liquid nitrogen cryostat.  

Light pulses of 0.5 m s in duration were produced by a green LED driven by a pulser. 

The LED was mounted in a black box outside the cryostat and optically connected to 

the  APD  through  an  optic  fiber.  The  intensity  of  light  pulses  generated by the LED 

was  monitored  by  a  PMT  (Hamamatsu  R1668).  The  output  signal  of  the  APD  was 

amplified  by  a  charge  sensitive  preamplifier  followed  by  a  spectroscopy  amplifier 

(Canberra  2021).  Semigaussian  shaping  with  shaping  time  of  1  m s  was  used.  The 

amplified  and  shaped  signals  from  both  the  APD  and  the  PMT  were  digitized  by  a 

peak ADC (LeCroy 2259B) and stored in a PC-based multichannel analyzer. The PC 

also controlled the LED and calibration pulsers and, synchronously, provided a gate 

for the ADC. The linearity, amplification, pedestal (offset) and the electronic noise of 

the whole spectrometric channel were measured using calibration pulses from a high 

precision pulser fed to the input of the preamplifier through a capacitance of 2.2 pF. 

The calibration was verified by observing the pulse height spectrum due to the direct 

conversion of 60 keV g -rays, from an 242Am source, in the photodiode at unitary gain. 

For precise measurement of the excess noise factor it is very important to maintain the 

stability of the APD gain during the acquisition. This requires stable bias voltage and 

 

3

temperature  as  the  gain  strongly  depends  on  both  of  them,  especially  at  high  gain 

values. 

In our measurements, the stability of the bias voltage was better than 0.1 V. To reduce 

the  ripples  from  the  HV  supply  (CAEN  N471),  an  RC-filter with a time constant of 

1 s  was  used.  The  variations  of  the  temperature  were  measured  with  a  precision  of 

0.02°C using a platinum thermoresistor fixed directly to the photodiode. During the 

acquisition of a single data point, the temperature variation did not exceed 0.2°C.  

3. Experimental Methods and Results 

A. Measurement of Gain 

The gain of the photodiode as function of the bias voltage was measured operating the 

LED  in  pulse  mode.  For  each  value  of  the  bias  voltage,  the  distribution  of  the 

amplitude of the APD charge signals was recorded. The mean value of the distribution 

was  normalized  to  the  mean  amplitude  of  the  signals  measured  at  low  voltage 

(Vbias=400V) where the gain is unitary [7]. Some results are plotted in Fig. 2.  

B. Measurement of Excess Noise Factor 

In an avalanche photodiode, the random character of the multiplication process of the 

electron-hole  pairs  under  an  electric  field  introduces  the  so-called  multiplication 

noise, which is characterized by the excess noise factor, F, defined as

where m is the gain of an avalanche in the photodiode and

By  considering  the  statistical nature of the avalanche formation, it was shown that F 

can be approximated to

where  e 2  includes  all  the  non-Poisson  contributions  to  the  fluctuations  in  N0. In the 

present measurements, the fluctuations of the intensity of the light source and the gain 

non-uniformity  in  the  photodiode can contribute to  e 2.  Replacing  eq. (4) in (3), one

For measuring the excess noise factor, the amplitude distribution of the APD output, 

as well as the distribution of the calibration  pulses, were acquired for different values 

of the gain under fixed intensity of the light pulses. A typical pulse height spectrum is 

shown in Fig. 3. From these distributions, the following values were determined:  s 2 

and A as the variance and the mean of the former distribution and s n

2 as the variance 

of the distribution of the calibration pulses.  The value of N0 was measured at M=1 as 

the  mean  charge  signal  amplitude  expressed  in  number  of  electrons.  It  was  set 

between 500 and 4000 depending on the run, and was kept fixed during each run.  

These measurements were carried out for gains up to 2000 in the temperature range 

from  0°C  down  to  –80 °C.  The  results  for  –40 °C  and  –80 °C  for  M>100  are 

represented in Fig. 4. In all the cases, the excess noise factor increases linearly with 

gain, i.e., 

=

(8) 

No temperature dependence  of F0 and k was observed within the experimental errors 

(Fig.5).  Averaging  the  values  of  F0  and k attained at different temperatures, one gets 

F0 = 1.87±0.02  and  k = 0.00239±0.00008.  These  results  are  consistent  with  those 

presented in [10]. 

Fig. 6  shows  the  noise  of  the  photodiode  and  preamplifier,  s n, as a function of the 

APD  gain  for  different  temperatures.  For  T £ -40ºC  and  M ‡

 5,  the  noise  is 

approximately  constant  and  »

  250  electrons  (r.m.s.).  At  higher  temperatures 

 

6

-
-
(T=-20ºC),  the  noise  increases dramatically for large gains due to the increase of the 

dark current.   

 C. Low-intensity signal detection 

The  reduction  of  the  dark  current  at  low  temperature  allows  the  detection  of  light 

signals of very low intensity, which produce just a few primary electron-hole pairs in 

the photodiode. In Fig.7, it is shown the spectrum corresponding to N0=4.3, N0 being 

the  mean  number  of  electron-hole pairs per light pulse (we observed similar spectra 

for  N0  varying  from  3  to  7  electron-hole  pairs).  For  these  measurements,  the 

calibration  in  N0  was  carried  out  with  the  photodiode  gain  equal  to 1 and using the 

PMT signal as reference (see Fig.1).  

To avoid possible non-linearity in the first channels of the ADC, an offset was added 

by  sending  a  test  pulse  of  fixed  amplitude  and  duration  at  the  preamplifier  input 

simultaneously  with  the  light  pulse.  The  value  of  the  offset  was  equivalent  to  1500 

electrons  at  the  photodiode  output.  Hence,  the  broad  pulse  distribution  in  Fig.7 

corresponds to the offset light pulses while the sharp peak at the left is due to the test 

pulses and is acquired with the LED turned off. The upper axis in Fig.7 was scaled to 

the  number  of  primary  electron-hole  pairs  by  dividing  the  charge  measured  at  the 

photodiode output by the APD gain, M. Similar spectra were observed in [10]. 

4. Conclusions. 

The  excess  noise  factor  of  a  Large  Area  Avalanche  Photodiode  was  measured  as  a 

function of gain and temperature. For the APD gains >100, it was found to be linear 

with gain and practically independent on  temperature in the range from 0ºC down to 

-80ºC.  The amplitude distributions of the signals with the average number of primary 

 

 

7

electron-hole pairs as small as 3 to 7 were measured, thus showing the possibility of 

detection of very low intensity light pulses.

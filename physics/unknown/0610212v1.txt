Abstract: A novel focusing structure with fractal properties is presented. It 
is a photon sieve in which the pinholes are appropriately distributed over the 
zones  of  a  fractal  zone  plate.  The  focusing  properties of  the fractal photon 
sieve are analyzed. The good performance of our proposal is demonstrated 
experimentally  with  a  series  of  images  obtained  under  white  light 
illumination.  It  is  shown  that  compared  with  a  conventional  photon  sieve, 
the  fractal  photon  sieve  exhibits  an  extended  depth  of  field  and  a  reduced 
chromatic aberration.

1. Introduction 

A  renewed  interest  in  diffractive  focusing  elements  has  been  experienced  by  the  scientific 
community in the last years because these elements are essential in image forming setups that 
are  used  in  THz  tomography  [1],  soft  X-ray  microscopy  [2,3],  astronomy  [4,5],  and 
lithography  [6].  Following  this  trend,  our  group  has  recently  introduced  a  new  type  of  2D 
photonic-image-forming  structures:  the  Fractal  Zone  Plates  (FZPs)  [7-9].  When  illuminated 
by  a  plane  wavefront,  a  FZP  produces  multiple  foci  along  the  optical  axis.  The  internal 
structure of each focus exhibits a characteristic fractal structure reproducing the self-similarity 
of  the  originating  FZP.  We  have  shown  that  the  number  of  foci  and  their relative amplitude 
can be modified with the FZP design [9]. It has been suggested, and proved very recently [10], 
that this property can be profited in image forming systems to obtain an enhancement of the 
depth of field.  

Photon  sieves  [3]  are  another  new  kind  of  diffractive  optical  elements,  developed  for 
focusing  and  imaging  soft  X  rays  with  high  resolution  capabilities.  A  conventional  photon 
sieve is essentially a Fresnel zone plate where the clear zones are replaced by great number of 
non  overlapping  holes  of  different  sizes.  Following  the  initial  paper  in  Nature,  several 
theoretical and experimental works related to photon sieves have been performed, explaining 
their properties from different points of view [11,12] and showing their good performance in 
different applications [5,6]. 

In  this  paper  a  new  diffractive  element:  the  fractal  photon  sieve  (FPS)  is  presented.  It 
consists of hundreds of small circular holes distributed over the zones of a FZP. We show that 
FPS potentially improves the performance of FZP in several aspects. Two features that greatly 
reduce  the  fabrication  constraints  and  allow  fractal  focusing  of  electromagnetic  waves  in  a 
wide  range  of  the  spectrum  are  the  following:  1)  The  hole  diameter  can  be  bigger  than  the 
width of the underlying zone, allowing a better resolution as compared with a FZP made with 
the  same  technology.  2) A FPS  has no connected  regions  and  then, it  can  be fabricated in a 
single surface without any substrate. In addition, the number and the distribution of holes per 
zone can be modified to improve the suppression of secondary maxima and higher orders of 
diffraction. 

2. Fractal photon sieve design 

As  was  discussed  in  Ref.  [7],  a  FZP  can  be  constructed  following  the  same  procedure 
performed to design conventional Fresnel zone plates. Let us review the concept: As it is well 
known, a Fresnel zone plate consists of alternately transparent and opaque zones whose radii 
are proportional to the square root of the natural numbers, thus it can be generated from a 1-D 
structure (see Fig. 1, upper part) defined by the periodic function q(ς), by performing a change 
of  coordinates  ς=(r0/a)2  and  by  rotating  the  transformed  1-D  function  around  one  of  its 
extremes. The result is a Fresnel zone plate having a radial coordinate ro and an outermost ring 
of  radius  a  [see  Fig.  2(a)].  In  a  similar  way  a  FZP  is  constructed  by  replacing  the  periodic 
function  used  in  the  generation  of  a  Fresnel  zone  plate,  by  a  1-D  fractal  structure,  as  for 
example the triadic Cantor set shown in Fig. 1 (lower part). The corresponding zone plate with 
fractal profile is represented in Fig. 2(b). It has been shown [7,10] that the irradiance along the 
optical axis produced by a FZP presents multiple foci with a distinctive fractal structure. The 
position,  size  and  depth  of  the  foci  depend  on  the  fractal  level  and  on  the  lacunarity  of  the 
encoded  fractal  structure.  Based  on  a  FZP,  the  FPS  here  proposed  combines  the  features  of 
FZP with the concept of photon sieve. A FPS has essentially the same structure of a FZP but 
instead of transparent rings the corresponding zones have been broken up into isolated circular 
holes. The  result  is shown in Fig. 2(c). In the construction procedure we adopted the results 
reported in Ref [3] where it has been shown that for a photon sieve constructed with a Fresnel 
zone  plate  structure,  the  diameter d  of  the  holes  in  each  ring  of  width  w  of  has  an  optimum 
value for the effective contribution to the focus. This value is given by d=1.53w.

As in a conventional photon sieve, the angular distribution of the holes in each ring can be 
fixed,  or  random  [like  in  Fig.  2(c)].  We  will  show  in  the  next  section  that  this  election  is 
irrelevant for the axial response. 

3. Focusing and imaging properties of FPS 

Let us consider the irradiance along the optical axis, z, given by an optical system having a  2-
, expressed in canonical polar coordinates, when it is illuminated by 
D pupil function 
a plane wave of wavelength λ:

The  axial  irradiance  in  Eq.  (1)  can  be  conveniently  expressed  in  terms  of  a  single  radial 
integral, by performing first the azimuthal average of the pupil function

:  

( φ,rp o
)

Then Eq. (1) can be rewritten as

. 

It is important to note that the azimuthal average of the pupil is the final responsible of the 
behavior of the axial irradiance, instead of the pupil itself. Therefore, from this point of view a 
photon sieve can be designed to achieve any convenient apodization by a proper modulation 
of the density of pinholes in each zone in which the distribution of holes can be either regular 
or random. 

To compare the performance of a FPS with the conventional FZP [7] we used Eqs. (2) and 
(3) to compute the axial irradiances provided by the corresponding pupil functions [see Figs. 
2(b) and 2(c)]. The result is shown in Fig. 3. The parameters used to calculate these plots were 
a=2mm and λ=632.8nm. The number of holes in the FPS was 650 and the density of holes per 
zone (i.e. the ratio between the area covered by the holes and the total area of the zone) was 
aproximately 90%. The minimun diameter in the outermost ring was d=1.53w=0.0572mm. As 
shown  in  Ref.  [7]  the  focal  structure  of  a  FZP  along  the  optical  axis  is  characterized  by the 
coincidence of  the  central  peak with  the one obtained for a conventional Fresnel zone plate, 
but the internal structure of the focus reproduce the self-similarity of the zone plate.

Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) . (a) FZP,  (b) and FPS  (both computed for S=3). 

This behavior is repeated at the higher-order diffraction foci [see Fig. 3(a)]. When the FZP is 
replaced by a FPS the principal focus remains almost unaltered but all odd higher orders are 
highly reduced due to the smoothing effect that the holes produce on the azimuthal average of 
the effective pupil [see Fig. 3(b)]. This effect is obtained at the expense of the appearance of 
low intensity even orders, which by design are null in the case of azimuthally uniform FZP. 
Note also that the secondary maxima in the principal focus are relatively higher for a FPS.We 
have experimentally tested the imaging capabilities of FPS under white light illumination. For 
comparison  images  of  test  object  (consisting  of  binary  letters  from  an  optotype-like  chart) 
were formed both with a conventional Fresnel photon sieve [3,5] with 81 zones and with the 
equivalent FPS (i.e. the same diameter and same outermost pinhole diameters) constructed for 
S=4. The diameter of the binary zone plates used in the experiment were 5mm and their focal 
distances 124mm, for λ=632.8nm. The photon sieves were printed and then photographically 
reduced  onto  35mm  slides.  The  images  of  the  test  object  were  obtained  directly  onto  an  8 
megapixels CMOS detector of area 22.2×14.8mm2 (Cannon EOS 350D digital camera [13]). 
The results are summarized in Fig. 4. Due to the different transmittances of both kind of zone 
plates  the  range  of  intensities  of  the  photographs  in  this  figure  were  normalized  to  the  peak 
intensity,  but  no  additional  post-processing  was  performed.  As  can  be  seen  the  out  of  focus 
image  obtained  with  the  FPS  is  considerably  better  than  the  one  obtained  with  the  Fresnel 
photon sieve (noticeable in the second and third lines of letters), the price paid to gain depth of 
field is a slightly poor resolution at the in-focus plane [see Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)]. Note also that 
the gain of the depth of field results in a considerable reduction in chromatic aberration when 
using  white  light.  In  spite  of  being  a  subjective  comparison  the  result  is  consistent  with  the 
prediction that can be done with the hypothesis of theoretical irradiances computed using Eq. 
(3). This result is shown in Fig. 5 were, for simplicity, the plots have been computed for S=3

As  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  5  the  reduction  of  the  chromatic  blur  can  be  explained  by  the 
overlapping of the foci for the different wavelengths that creates an overall extended depth of 
field which is less sensitive to the chromatic aberration. 

4. Conclusions 

We have proposed a photon sieve with fractal focusing properties. The structure of the sieve is 
based on FZP, and therefore, their behavior for the first diffraction order is similar. The main 
difference is that the higher-orders obtained with the FZP are highly reduced with the sieve. 
The numerical and experimental results provided in this paper show the focusing and image-
forming  properties  of  FPS.  With  a  FPS  a  substantial  increase  in  the  depth  of  field  and  a 
noticeable  reduction  in  the  chromatic  aberration  can  be  obtained  with  respect  to  a  Fresnel 
photon  sieve  of  the  same  focal  distance.  In  our  opinion  the  FPS  offer  a  great  versatility  in 
design pupils for particular focusing properties because of there are many parameters, as the 
fractal dimension, the number of zones, the diameter and density of holes per zone, that can be 
varied conveniently to obtain a specific result. Another advantage of FPS over the FZP arises 
from  the  fabrication  point  of  view:  the  FPS  can  be  constructed  in  a  single  structure  without 
any supporting substrate. Furthermore, there are potential improvements in the design of FPS 
such as increasing the efficiency by the use of composite zones [14]. Therefore applications in 
optical  and  non-optical  wavelength  range  in  which  graded  amplitude  pupils  are  difficult  or 
even impossible to construct will greatly will benefit from these new focusing structures.

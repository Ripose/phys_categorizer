The physical property of mass has two distinct aspects, gravitational mass  and  inertial  mass.
The weight of a particle depends on its gravitational mass. According to the weak form of the
equivalence principle, the gravitational and inertial masses  are  equivalent.  But,  we  show here
that they are correlated by  a dimensionless  factor, which can be different of one .  The factor
depends on the  electromagnetic energy absorbed or emitted by the particle and of the index of
refraction  of  the  medium  around  the  particle.  This  theoretical  correlation  has  been
experimentally  proven by means of a very simple apparatus,  presented here.

          Recently,  L.V.  Hau  et  al.,8
succeeded  in  reducing  the  speed  of
light to  17  m/s    by  optically inducing  a

quantum 
Einstein  condensate.  This  means  an

          This equation shows clearly that,
atoms  (or  molecules)  can  have  their
gravitational 
  strongly
  masses 
reduced 
  by  means  of  Extra-Low
Frequency  (ELF) radiation.
          We  have  built  an  apparatus  to
produce ELF radiation ( transmitter and
antenna)  and  to  check  the  effects  of
this  radiation  upon  the  gravitational
mass  of    a  material      surrounding  the
antenna ( see Fig. 1).
          The  antenna 
is  a  half-wave

(purified iron, 99.95% Fe;

Therefore, from  the  Fig.1  we  conclude
that    the  iron  sphere  will    absorb
practically all radiation emitted from the
dipole.  Indeed,  the  sphere  has  been
designed    with  this  purpose,  and  in
such  a  manner  that  all  their  atoms
should be reached  by the radiation. In
this  way,  the  radiation  outside  of  the
sphere is practically  negligible.

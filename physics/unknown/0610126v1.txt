Abstract 
 
We present the effect of a nanostructured surface on the emission of ions and 
electrons from intense (5-36 Petwatt per sq.cm) femtosecond laser produced plasmas. 
Electrons  from  optically  polished  copper  targets  coated  with  copper  nanoparticles 
(CuNP) are observed to be hotter than those from uncoated polished targets. A nearly 
two-fold  enhancement  is  observed  for  ions  in  the  range  14-74  keV,  while  ion  yield 
decreases  by  a  factor  of  2  in  the  74-2000  keV  range.  The  total  ion  yields  measured 
using a large area Faraday cup are more from CuNP targets than those from polished 
Cu targets, indicating increased ion beam divergence  due to surface modulations.

Introduction 

1. 

 

The advent of ultrashort, intense solid state lasers has enabled the production of high 
quality particle beams with high energy and brightness1-2. Not only is the physics of 

these  ultrashort  duration  beams  very  interesting,  but  their  potential  applications  in 

areas  like  inertial  confinement  fusion,  accelerators,  isotope  production  for  medicine 
and surface modifications are extremely important for future technologies3.  When an 

intense laser pulse interacts with the target, rapid ionization occurs at the beginning of 

the  laser  pulse  and  the  electrons  in  the  plasma  then  absorb  the  light  by  a  variety  of 
mechanisms  like  resonance  absorption  (RA)4    and  vacuum  heating  (VH)5.    The 

electrons  which  gain  energy  through  these  mechanisms  form  a  distinct  ’hot’  bunch 

well  separated  in  energy  from  the  colder  electrons  in  the  bulk  plasma.  The  hot 

electrons radiate part of their energy via x-ray emission and also transfer their energy 

to the ions in the plasma.  Ion acceleration occurs when the hot plasma expands and 

an electric field is created due to charge separation.  Ion acceleration in plasma with 
multiple  electron  temperatures  has  been  explored  in  simulations6,7  and  in  different 

experimental  situations.    The  multiplicity  of  species  and  how  it  leads  to  deviations 
from  self-similarity  in  the  expansion  has  been  examined6.    Many  studies  have 
the  systematics  of  particle  production  from  solid2,3,8,  cluster9  and 
reported 
microdroplet10 plasmas. Efficient coupling of laser energy into the short-lived plasma 

thus plays a crucial role in ion generation.  Enhanced coupling of laser energy to the 

plasma  has  been  achieved  by  the  creation  of  a  preplasma  before  the  arrival  of  the 
main  pulse,  by  modifying  target  composition  in  the  case  of  clusters9  and  by  the 
introduction of sub laser wavelength surface modulations on solid targets.11,12  In fact, 

the  introduction  of  a structured  surfaces  has been  shown  to increase  the  coupling  of 

laser energy by as much as 80 % as compared to that for polished surfaces. A general 

question  that  may  be  posed  is  whether  ion  energies  can  similarly  be  increased  by 

optimization of the target properties; A more pertinent  question is whether  the same 

optimization  scheme  will  work  for  enhanced  generation  of  hot  electrons  as  well  as 

higher energy ions.  This is based on the expectation that hotter electrons (enhanced  

coupling of laser energy) should lead to hotter  ions. Is this borne out in experiments?  

In  this  letter  we  report  systematic  study  of  the  influence  of  surface  modulations  on 

 

2

characteristics  of  the  emitted  ions  from  a  femtosecond  laser  produced  plasma.  With 

this perspective, here we present results for nanoparticle coated targets.

Experimental Details 

The  experiment  (Fig.  1)  is  performed  with  focused  50  fs,  p-polarized  laser 

pulses (1-6 mJ) from a 806 nm, 10Hz, Ti-Saphhire laser (THALES LASER, ALPHA 

10).  The target is a polished copper block (50 mm × 50 mm × 5 mm), half of which is 

coated with a thick layer of copper nanoparticles (CuNP) with an average size of 15 

nm.    The  nanoparticles  are  deposited  using  high-pressure  DC  magnetron  sputtering 
technique.13 The crystallite size is determined from the Scherrer broadening of the Cu 

[111] x-ray diffraction line. The partially coated target ensures exactly the same laser 

and  detector  conditions  for  measurements  from  both  surfaces.  The  typical  coating 

thickness of the NPs is about 0.2 µm which is large compared to the optical skin depth 
of  a  few  nanometers.  The  base  pressure  of  the  chamber  is  10-6  torr.    The  target  is 

scanned across the laser beam to ensure that every laser pulse hits a fresh region.  The 

laser is focused by a gold coated off axis parabolic mirror (OAP), in an f/4 focusing 

geometry with a spot size (FWHM)of 10 µm giving peak intensites in the 0.5 – 3.6 × 
1016 Wcm-2 range.  The hard x- ray spectra in the 20 – 200 keV range are measured 

for a total of 3000 – 4000 laser shots using a calibrated NaI(Tl) scintillation detector 

shielded  by  1.5  cm  thick  lead  bricks,  coupled  with  a  multichannel  analyzer.    The 

detector is gated in time with the laser pulse and the signal is collected only in a time 

window of 30 µs to ensure background-free acquisition.  Bremsstrahlung temperature 

fits are done using the data above 50 keV, where the transmission is close to 100%. 

Count rates are kept at less than 0.1 per laser shot (to prevent pile up) by introducing 

suitable lead apertures and restricting the solid angle to 50 – 80 µsr.  The ions emitted 

normal to the target surface are detected by a channel electron multiplier (CEM) and a 

Faraday cup (FC) arrangement.  The CEM, kept at a distance of 97 cm from the focal 

spot  directly  views  the  plasma  plume  subtending  a  solid  angle  of  26  msr.    The  FC 
(230 cm2  area)  is  used  to  collect  all  the  emitted  charge particles  from  the plasma  to 

obtain  the  total  ion  flux.  The  FC,  made  of  11µm  thick  Aluminium  foil  is  biased  at 

+100 V to arrest secondary electrons. It stops all the heavier ions, while transmitting 
higher energy electrons.14

Results and inferences 

Fig.  2  shows  the  ratio  of  total  x-ray  yield  from  CuNP  coated  surface  to  that 

from  the  polished  Cu  surface  at  different  input  laser  energy  corresponding  to  the 

intensities  in  the  range  of  0.9  –  3.6  ×  1016  Wcm-2.    The  yield  from  NPs  is 

approximately 4 times that from the polished Cu surface, up to an intensity of 2.5 × 
1016  Wcm-2  after  which  it  gradually  decreases  to  approximately  1.5  times.    The 

bremsstrahlung  (hard  x-ray)  spectra  from  both  the  polished  Cu  and  CuNP  coated 
surface  at  the  input  intensity  of  3  ×  1016  Wcm-2  are  shown  as  insets  (a)  and  (b) 

respectively.  We observe a clear enhancement in the hard x-ray spectrum of CuNP, 
indicating  hotter  electrons  in  the  nanoplasma,  in  tune  with  previous  results.11    The 

total (integrated) energy of x rays emitted in the range of 30 – 200 KeV for polished 
Cu and NP surface is 2.9×104 KeV (2.9× 10-9 mJ)  and 4.4×104 KeV (7.05× 10-9 mJ)  

respectively.  The hot electron distribution in Cu plasma is a single Maxwellian with a 

temperature of 9.3 ± 1.1 KeV, whereas the CuNP plasma shows two-temperatures: 9.5 

± 1.7 KeV and 33.9 ± 6.4 KeV, indicating enhanced coupling of laser energy into NP 

coated surface when compared to the polished surface. For p-polarized light, the hot 

electrons  are  generated  mainly  by  resonance  absorption  (RA)  under  our  conditions.  
The  hot  electron  temperature,  Thot,  can  be  estimated  following  the  scaling  law:16

, where Tc is the background electron temperature in keV, I is the 

intensity  of  the  laser  in  units  of  1016  Wcm-2  and  λ  is  the  wavelength  in  microns.  

According to this scaling law, for a Tc of 0.15 keV (estimated for our intensities), we 

get a Thot of 9.2 keV. This temperature is close to that observed for the polished target 

and  the  lower  of  the  two  components  observed  in  the  nanoparticles  coated  targets.  
This  also  agrees  with  earlier  measurements.11,17    The  hotter  component  of  33  keV 
agrees with our earlier studies and is attributed to local field enhancements of the laser 

light  or  alternately  surface  plasmon  excitation  facilitated  by  the  nanoparticle 
coating.11,12    

Time of flight spectra (inset of Fig. 3a) of the ions clearly show differences in 

energies  observed  from  the  NP-coated  surface  and  polished  Cu.    The  polished  Cu 

surface, at lower input intensities, shows two main features representing two different 

ion species of 50 – 80 and 220 – 257 KeV energy.  With increasing input energy, the 

two peaks merge, giving a single distribution of the ions in the 220 – 340 KeV energy 
 
4

range. In contrast, the CuNP surface gives three distinct peaks at 25, 46, and 324 KeV 

at  low  incident  laser  energy.    This  evolves  into  a  two-peak  feature  indicating  the 

presence of two sets of ions (B and C in inset of Fig. 3a) of energies 46 – 61 and 238 

– 324 KeV.  From the n(E) – E spectrum, where n(E) is the number of ions emitted 

(Fig. 3b) within the energy range of E to E+dE, a clear presence of two distributions 

of ions is visible.  Though the number of particles emitted from the both the Cu and 

CuNP targets is same in the low energy range 4 – 16 KeV (region A of Fig. 3a), the 

number  of  particles  emitted  from  the  nanoplasma  is  nearly  1.5  times  more  in  the 

intermediate  energy  (16  –  75  KeV)  range  (region  B  of  Fig.  3a).    Above  75  KeV 

(region C of Fig. 3a) the number is lower by a factor of 2.  At all the incident energies 

used in our studies, the maximum ion energy as well as the average energy from the 

CuNP  is  observed  to  be  lower  than  the corresponding  values  from  polished  surface.  

The  ratio  of  the  ion  yield,    from  nanostructured  surface  to  that  from  polished  Cu 

(YCuNP/YCu)  is  in  the  range  of  0.84  –  0.89  indicating  lower  ion  yield  from  the  Cu 

nanoplasma.    The  cutoff  ion  energy  from  both  the  CuNP  and  Cu  surface  over  the 

input  laser  energy  is  shown  in  Fig  3b.    The  cutoff  ion  energy  from  the  Cu  plasma 
increases from 1.58 to 3.80 MeV as the laser intensity increases from 0.9 to 3.6 × 1016 
Wcm-2.  The corresponding values are 1.0 to 2.0 MeV for CuNP plasma indicating a 

reduction  of  around  50  %  in  the  high  energy  ion  emission  from  the  CuNP  plasma.  

Above an intensity of 3.2 × 1016 Wcm-2, the cutoff ion energy from the CuNP plasma 

is  almost  the  same  as  that  for  Cu,  indicating  the    damage  to  the  NP  coating,  in 
agreement with our previous results.15  We also examined the  possibility that protons 

could be preferentially enhanced in their energy in the nanoparticle coated target, but  

that is ruled out by  the measured  time of flight spectra, the details of which wil be 

reported in a longer paper.  

This clearly shows that though more laser energy is coupled to the NP-coated 

surface  than  the  polished  surface,  the  ion  emission  from  the  NP  coated  surface  gets 

preferentially enhanced in an intermediate regime.  The highest ion energy decreases 

for  the  NP coated surface.    This  is  in  contradiction  to  the  usual  expectation  that  the 
generation  of  hotter  electrons  should  lead  to  hotter  ion  emission.7,18    The  CEM 

measurements show  that the total particle yield as well as the maximum ion energy is 

always lower than the polished target over the entire laser energy range used.  To get 

a  measure  of  the  overall  ion  yield,  we  measured  the  total  ion  currents  from  the  two 

 

5

types of targets at a location closer to the target, using a large area Faraday cup (FC) 

subtending  a  solid  angle  of  2.36  Sr  to  the  plasma  focus.      The  total  charge 

accumulated  by  the  FC  (Fig.  4b)  shows  that  the  total  particle  yield  is  25%  more  in 

case of CuNP targets compared to polished Cu targets. This measuremen is contrary 

to  the  result  of  the  low  solid  angle  CEM  measurement,    and    these  two  results  

indicate  that  the  ion  beam  from  the  nanoparticle  coated  targets  has  a  greater 

divergence. 

To look at our results from a comparative perspective, let us first consider the 

ion  emission  from  the  polished  (unstructured)  copper  targets.  The  hot  electrons 

produced  by  the  intense  laser,  together  with  the  colder  electrons  form  a  two–
temperature  plasma6.    The  ‘self-similar’  expansion  of  one  electron  temperature 

plasma gives rise to ions that eventually emerge with the speed of sound in the plasma 
medium19.    The  two-temperature  plasma  on  the  other  hand  gives  rise  to  a  sheath 

formation  at  a point  in  the  density  profile  across  which  the  ions  are  accelerated  and 
these  emerge  as  the  hot  ions.6      The  field  developed  across  the  sheath  can  be 

expressed  as  Eaccl  =  kBTe  /e[max  (Ln,λD)],  where  Ln  is  the  local  scale  length  of  the 
expanding plasma and λD is the Debye length. 2,20  The magnitude of the accelerating 

electric field Eaccl depends on the temperature of the escaping hot electrons as well as 

on  the  sheath  thickness,  which  in  turn  depends  on  the  plasma  electron  density  and 

temperature.  The  model  assumes  isothermal  expansion  which  may  not  be  strictly 

valid, but the general features are well reproduced even under this approximation.   

     Following  Mora17,  the  maximum  energy  of  the  ions  can  be  estimated  by 

Emax = 2E0 [ln(2τ)], where E0 = ZkBTh, τ = 0.43 ωpi and the ion plasma frequency ωpi = 
(ne0Ze2/mi∈0)1/2, ne0 being the unperturbed electron density and  Z is the charge state 

of  the  ions.    Given  our  observed  cut  off  ion  energy  of  2.15  MeV,  and  assuming  an 

average ionization state Z = 4,  ne0 = ncr and a hot electron temperature Th = 9.3 keV, 

we get τ = 0.29 indicating that the long time approximation is valid (much longer than 
the  laser  pulse  duration).  The  maximum  velocity  comes  out  to  be  2.51  ×  106  m/sec. 
This  also  matches  well  with  the  observed  velocities  of  2.44  ×  106  m/sec  in  the 

experiment.    While  applying  these  derived  parameters  for  CuNP    we  get  maximum 

ion  energies  of  2.15  MeV  and  7.7  MeV  for  the  two  hot  electron  temperature  as 

observed  in  bremsstrahlung  spectra  in  contradiction  to  the  observed  maximum  ion 

energy of 2.0 MeV (Fig. 3b) clearly indicating  that the accelerating potential for ion 
 
6

expansion is suppressed in case of nanoparticles. So the key question that we need to 

address  is  the  suppression  of  ion  energies  in  comparison  to  the  observed  energies 

arising in polished targets.  

We are investigating the reduction in the maximum ion energy as well as the 
multispecies  ion  acceleration  using  PIC  simulations.21  In  this  letter,  we  offer  some 

plausible  physical  explanations.  Firstly,  the  nanoparticle  coating  causes  significant 

deviation from the assumption of planar 1D expansion, clearly evident in our Faraday 

cup measurements of the divergence (the nanoparticles are ‘smearing the ions).  It is 

well known that in multidimensional (ex: spherical) expansion the maximum energy 
is lower than the 1 D case.22 The nanoparticles act as the first sources of the plasma 
because of the enhanced laser intensities in the immediate vicinity of each particle.11  
If we take the critical plasma density (1021 cm-3) and Th =9.3 keV, the Debye length is 

17  nm,  which  is  of  the  same  size  as  the  nanoparticles.  The  actual  Debye  length  for 

colder  temperatures  achieved  on  the  rising  edge  of  the  laser  pulse  is  much  smaller. 

The  plasma  is  likely  to  expand  away  from  these  hot  spots  with  significant 

nonplanarity,  guided  mainly  by  the  initial  shape  of  these  ellipsoidal  particles.    The 

effective Debye length is thus smaller and leads to lower ion velocities as given by eq. 
It is also possible that the nanoparticles perturb the plasma by ‘lightning rod’ effects10 

and these can prevent charge build up and disturb sheath formation which  results in 

lower  sheath  voltage  and  hence  lower  expansion.  It  is  known  from  the  numerical 

simulations  as  well  as  from  the  experimental  observations  that  the  particle  emission 

happens mostly normal to the surface and the nonplanar plasma expansion thus gives 

rise  to  the  increase  beam  divergence.    The  reduction  in  the  maximum  energy  of  the 

protons and ions from the laser produced plasmas leading to the increased scale length 

resulting in divergent ion and proton beams due to the surface modulations have been 
observed.23,24  All  these  arguments  are  supported  by  our  recent  observations  of  the 
survival15 of these nanoparticles at intensities as high as 2 × 1016 Wcm-2. 

The present study is significant because it shows that hot electron generation 

need  not  cause  hotter  ion  emission.    We  point  out  that,  in  general,  optimization  of 

each signal from the plasma requires an understanding of the actual dynamics of the 

process.  In  our  case,  hot  electron  generation  is  enhanced  by  the  local  field 

enhancements which increase the effective light intensity. This process takes place on 

the time scale of the laser pulse (tens of fs). The ion acceleration, however, depends 

 

7

on  a  subsequent  process  namely  the  plasma  expansion  and  energy  exchange.    We 

believe that this is significantly modified by the same nanoparticles in a counteracting 

manner  and  leads  to  enhanced  number  of  ions  in  the  intermediate  range  (14  –  74 

KeV) and reduces the high energy ions above 74 KeV.  

In summary, we have presented ion energy and flux measurements from plane 

polished  targets  as  well  as  those  coated  by  copper  nanoparticles.  A  significant  and 

surprising observation is that the nanoparticles coated targets give hotter electrons but 

colder  ions.  The  enhancement  of  x-ray  emission  and  selective  suppression  of  high 

energy  ion  emission  can  prove  very  useful  in  designing  brighter  hard  x-ray  sources 
with  reduced  damage  from  ion  debris24.    We  expect  that  this  result  will  provoke  a 

discussion of the physics involved and help in the design of femtosecond laser driven 

x-ray and ion sources.

systems are discussed.

INTRODUCTION  
The idea of EOC of particle beams in a storage ring is 
based  on  external  selectivity  of  interaction  between 
radiation 
particles  and 
wavelets  (URW)  [1],  [2].  The  scheme  of  EOC  is 
presented  on  Figure  1.  URW  is  emitted  in  a  pick-up 
undulator, focused, amplified in an optical amplifier and 
pass a kicker undulator together with the same particle. 
Geometrical  parameters  of  electron  and  optical  beam 
lines  are  chosen  such  a  way  that  particle  enters  the 
kicker undulator at decelerating phase. Particles interact 
with their URWs effectively in the regime of small and 
moderate  current  (see  below).  The  selectivity  of 
interaction  arranged  by  a  moving  screen  located  in  the 
image plane of optical system projecting URW there.

   Based  on  this  observation,  an  enhanced  scheme  of 
emittance exchange under conditions of week cooling in 
the  frame    of  the  Robinson’s  damping  criterion  was 
sugested and diveloped for unbunched beam (RF turned 
off)  in  [1],  [3].  Later  three  EOC  schemes  of  the  same 
principle were suggested in [1], [2]. Below the scheme 
of EOC is developed.  

PHYSICS OF EOC 
   Different  lattice  and  optic  geometries  can  be  used  in  
EOC. Below we consider some of them.           
 
                                 Geometry I 
   Two  or  more  identical  undulators  are  installed  in  
straight  sections  of  a  storage  ring  at  a  distance 
determined  by  a  betatron  phase  advance  for  the  lattice 
segment  (2
p π+

  between  pick-up  and  first  kicker 
undulator  and  πp′2
  between  next  kicker    undulators; 
′
where
=1,2,3... are integer numbers. Untransparent 
screen  is  moved  out  of  the  image,  URWs  pass  by  the 
screen, amplified and pass through kicker undulators.   
xη >  at locations of undulators and screens are 
   Let 
absent. Particles enter kicker undulators at decelerating 
phases of URW. Then if a deviation of a particle in the 
,  the  deviation  of  the  particle 
pick-up  undulator 

xβ >
in  the  kicker  undulators  comes  to  be 

  and,

according  to  (2),  the  energy  loss  by  the  particle  is 
accompanied  by  a  decrease  of  both  its  energy  and 
amplitude  of  betatron  oscillations.  On  the  contrary,  if 
the  deviation  of  the  particle  in  the  pick-up  undulator 
xβ < , the deviation of a particle in kicker undulators 
  and,  according  to  (2),  the  energy 
comes  to  be

loss by the particle is accompanied by a decrease in its 
energy  and  increase  of  its  amplitude  of  betatron 
oscillations. As a result, the energy spread of the beam 
is not changed because of all particles lose their energy 
independent  on  the  closed  orbit  position,  the  angular

approximation because of all particles lose their energy

equal  probability.  The  beam  is  displaced  only  as  a 
whole in the radial direction.   
   To cool particle beam we have to introduce selectivity 
of interaction between particles and their URWs. Below 
we consider physics of EOC in three  cooling schemes 
for  the  above  geometry  in  case  of  unbunched  particle 
beams  if  an  optical  systems  including  untransparent 
screens are used for selection.  
   I. The edge of a screen is  shifted to the initial position 
of the edge of the particle beam image corresponding to 
minimum  particle  energy  and  stay  at  rest  (the  way  for 
URW  beam  is  open).  In  this  case  particles  loose  their 
energy  in  the  combined  fields  of  amplified  URW  and 
kicker  undulator,  their  closed  orbits  go  to  the  closed 
orbit  of  minimum  initial  energy  and  the  image  of  the 
particle beam moves to the screen. As a result,  closed 
orbits  of  particles  will  be  stopped  near  to  the  position 
corresponding  to  the  minimum  energy  of  particles  of 
the beam after their URW beam will be overlapped by 
the  screen  in  the  image  plane  and  the  way  for  URW 
beam will be closed.  
   In  this  case  the  position  of  the  closed  orbit  of  a 
particle,  the  dispersive  beam  size  2 ησ   and  the  energy 
spread of the particle beam  2 Eσ  will be changed by the 
law

   The  expressions  (4),  (5)  are  valid  until  the  distance

orbits will be stopped.

   The considered scheme of EOC is similar to radiative 
ion cooling one using broadband laser beams with sharp 
low frequency edges corresponding to excitation of ions 
of  minimum  and  higher  energies  only  and  internal 
selectivity based on resonance ion properties [1], [4].  
   II.  A  screen    overlap  the  URW  beam  in  the  image

   III.  A  screen    overlap  the  URW  beam  in  the  image

a  decrease  both  the  energy  and  amplitudes  of  betatron

   So  the  considered  schemes  of  EOC  II  and  III  are 
going both in the longitudinal and transverse degrees of 
freedom. After the slit or screen will open images of all 
particles  of  the  beam,  the  optical  system  must  be 
switched off. Then the cooling process can be repeated.

lead  to  change  of  the  particle’s  betatron  amplitudes  at 
the  exit  of  the  last  undulator.  So  it  leads  to  cooling  of 
the particle beam in the longitudinal plane only.  
 
                              Geometry III  
   A  pick-up  undulator  and  even  number  of  kicker 
undulators are installed in straight sections of a storage 
ring  at  distances  determined  by  a  phase  advance 
  (like  to  the  previous  case)  but  optical  paths 
(2
are shifted to π(contrary to the previous case). That is 
why  particles  decrease  their  energy  in  odd  undulators 
and increase it in even ones.  
   In  this  case  the  change  of  the  energy  of  particles  in 
undulators leads to decrease of their betatron amplitudes 
and does not lead to change of their energy at the exit of 
the  last  undulator.  In  this  case  cooling  of  the  particle 
beam is going in the transverse plane only.  
   The  goal  of  usage  of  pick-up  and  kicker  undulators, 
laser  and  optical  systems  in  the  scheme  of  EOC  is 
similar  to  one  in  the  method  of  optical  stochastic 
cooling  (OSC)  [6]-[9].  Use  of  lenses  and  location  of 
screens  in  the  image  plane  is  a  principal  moment  for 
selection of particles in the method of EOC.

TO THE THEORY OF EOC 
Below  we  consider  the  theory  of  the  EOC  for  the 
scheme 3 in the Geometry I. 
   The velocity of a particle closed orbit  xη(cid:5)  depends on 
 of the particle to emit in  the pick-up

interact  with  this  particle  in  the  kicker  undulator.  This

probability  is  determined  by  the  projection

LATTICE   LIMITATIONS 
  In  the  smooth  approximation  the  relative  phase  shifts 
of  particles  in  their  URWs  radiated  in  the  pick-up 
undulator  and  displaced  to  the  entrance  of  kick 
undulators  depend  on  theirs  energy  and  amplitude  of 
betatron oscillations. If we assume that the longitudinal 
shifts  of  URWs 
,  then  the  amplitudes  of 
,min / 2
betatron oscillations, transverse horizontal emittance of 
the  beam  and  the  energy  spread  of  the  beam,  in  the 
smooth approximation, must not exceed the values

   Strong  limitations  (32)    to  the  energy  spread  can  be 
overcame  if,  special  elements  in  storage  ring  lattices 
(short  inverted  dipoles,  quadrupole  lenses  et  al.)  to 
decrease the slip [10]-[13] will be used along the paths 
between  undulators.  A  change  in  time  of  optical  paths 
of URWs can be produced according to the decrease of 
the high energy edge of the being cooled  beam as well. 
With cooling of fraction of the beam at a time only, the 
EE /∆   now 
lengthening  problem  diminishes  also  as 
stands  for  the  energy  spread  in  the  part  of  the  beam 
which is under cooling at the moment.

SELECTIVITY TECHNIQUE 
   The  transverse  selectivity  of  radiation  by  movable 
screen  can  be  arranged  with  help  of  electro-optical 
elements.  These  elements  contain  crystals,  which 
change  its  refraction  index  while  external  voltage 
applied. This technique is well known in optics [17]. In 
simplest  case  the  sequence  of  electro-optical  deflector 
and  a  diaphragm  followed  by  optical  lenses,  allow 
controllable selection of radiation generated by different 
parts of the beam.

LIMITING RESOLUTION OF THE 
OPTICAL SYSTEM 
UR emitted by a particle in the undulator installed in a 
stright section of a storage ring propagates in a narrow 
γ(cid:17)
cone of a solid angle 
 to the particle velocity. 
1/
The  limiting  resolution  angle  of  any  optical  system  is 
determined  by  the  equation   
,  where 
θ
r
 is the diameter of the UR light on the  first 
, 
URλ λ=
d
l θ(cid:17)
,  where  l   is  the  distance 
mirror.  The  value 
c

why the space  resolution of the particle beam is limited 
by the value  
(cid:17)
                         
   The resolution (34) determines the limiting degree of

                  COOLNG IN A BUCKET 

Cooling  of    particles  can  be  produced  in  the  radio 
frequency (RF) bucket. In this case the screen must be 
moved  to  the  position  of  the  image  of  the  equilibrium 
orbit  and  stopped  at  this  position.  Cooling cycles  must 
be repeated periodically.

CONCLUSION 
  We considered EOC of particle beams in storage rings 
mainly  for  unbun
ched  beam.  The  rate 
of  EOC  defined 
by  the  ratio  of  the  energy  spread  to  the  rate  of  the 
energy loss is more than the rate of OSC.  Methods of 
calculations  developed  in  this  paper  can  be  useful  for 
OSC as well (see Appendix). 
   The  damping  time  (18)  is  proportional  to  both 
energy spread and radial betatron beam dimension. First 
cooling cycle can be long and include cooling of halo of 
the  beam.  Next  cooling  cycles  can  be  much  shorter  to 
support the beam dimensions small.  
   The considered schemes of EOC are of great interest 
for  cooling  of  fully  stripped  ion,  proton  and  muon 
beams.  Laser  cooling,  based  on  nuclear  transitions  has 
problems  with  low-lying  levels  [19].  EOC  of  heavy 
ions, on the level with OSC, is the most efficient. In this 
, where Z is the 
case the number of emitted photns 
atomic number [20].

ction does not 
decreased (if dispersion fun
increased on 
time)  and  for  EOC  it  stay  constant.  The  amplitude  of 
betatron  oscillations  of  particles  decay  according  to 
exponential  law  for  OSC  with  small  initial  rate  of 
decreese  and  for  EOC  it  decay  near  to  zero  value    for 
the damping time.  
  Similar situation (exponential decay) is for the scheme 
of  OSC  based  on  ordinary  pick-up  and  kicker 
undulators  considered  in  [7].  In  this  case  the  energy 
change  of  particles  depends  on  the  phase  of  their  own 
URWs  amplified  in  the  optical  amplifier  at  which  the 
particles enter the kicker  undulator. This scheme has an 
advantage in comparison with one based on quadrupole 
undulator  as  in  this  case  it  use  ordinary  pick-up 
undulator  and  that  is  why  the  value  of  the  undulator 
magnetic field does not depend on radial coordinate and 
can be high (
 

510  Gs).

Abstract. The theme of doing quantum mechanics on all abelian groups goes back to Schwinger
If the group is a vector space of ﬁnite dimension over a non-archimedean locally
and Weyl.

compact division ring, it is of interest to examine the structure of dynamical systems deﬁned by
Hamiltonians analogous to those encountered over the ﬁeld of real numbers. In this letter a path

integral formula for the imaginary time propagators of these Hamiltonians is derived.

1. Introduction

General formulations of quantum theory when the conﬁguration space is an abelian
group have been the theme of studies by Weyl1 and Schwinger2. The present letter
arose out of studies of quantum systems not only over the reals but over other
ﬁelds and rings, especially p-adic ﬁelds and adele rings3,4,5. The main result is
that for an interesting class of Hamiltonians H over nonarchimedean ﬁelds that are
analogous to the conventional ones, we can set up a formalism that leads to a path
integral formula for the propagators e−tH (t > 0). The integrals are over the so-
called Skorokhod space 6,7 of paths which allow discontinuities, but only of the ﬁrst
kind, namely that the left and right limits exist at all time points and the paths
are right continuous. This is to be contrasted with the real case where the path
integrals are with respect to conditional Wiener measures and so are on the space

1

of continuous paths.

The study of quantum systems over ﬁnite and discrete structures has been of
interest for a long time8. Interest in quantum structures over p-adic ﬁelds also goes
back a long way9, but in recent years there has been quite a bit of activity, not
only over p-adic ﬁelds but over the adele rings of number ﬁelds also, and there are
many treatments of these more general dynamical systems including path integral
formulations10,11. The literature is extensive and an excellent review that includes a
very good exposition of the basics of p-adic theory is12. But the formalism presented
in this letter appears to be new.

I wish to thank S. R. S. Varadhan and Don Babbitt for some interesting dis-

cussions on the ideas in this letter.

2. Vector spaces over local ﬁelds and division rings13

We consider as conﬁguration spaces vector spaces over a division ring D which is
ﬁnite dimensional over a local (=locally compact, nondiscrete, commutative) ﬁeld
K of arbitrary characteristic. Unlike the case of the real ﬁeld over which there
are only three division algebras of ﬁnite rank, namely, the reals, complexes, and
the quaternions, the theory of division algebras over nonarchimedean local ﬁelds is
much richer and is deeply arithmetical. Let K be any nonarchimedean local ﬁeld
of arbitrary characteristic and D a division algebra of ﬁnite dimension over K. We
shall assume that K is the center of D; this is no loss of generality since we may
always replace K by the center of D. Let dx be a Haar measure on D and
| · |
is a

{

then R is the maximal compact subring of D, P is its maximal left, right, or two-
sided ideal, F := R/P is a ﬁnite ﬁeld of, say q, elements, and there is an element
π such that P = Rπ = πR. Put P m = πmR = Rπm(m
Z) and write d0x
for the Haar measure for which
R d0x = 1. For any nontrivial additive character

3. Hamiltonians over W

Consider the p-adic Schr¨odinger theory which consists of the study of the spectra
of and semigroups generated by operators (“Hamiltonians”) in L2(W ) of the form
H = H0 + V . Here H0 is a pseudodiﬀerential operator and V is a multiplication
b(b > 0) in H = L2(W ), and put
operator. Write MW,b for multiplication by
∆W,b = FMW,bF−1. We consider Hamiltonians will of the form

x

|

|

HW,b = ∆W,b + V

Notice that for D = R and b = 2 this construction gives HW,b =

∆.

4. The probability densities ft,b

We shall show that the dynamical semigroup e−tHW,b (t > 0) is just convolution
by a one-parameter semigroup of probability densities. Lemma 2 contains the key
calculation in the present letter and allows us to replace the Gaussian densities of
the conventional theory by these densities. 1E is the characteristic function of the
set E.

LEMMA 1. Fix dual Haar measures dx and dξ on W and W ∗ respectively. Let L

W = Dn = W ∗, L = Rn = L∗. The last assertion of the lemma follows from (2.5).

So, if we take k such that b/2 < k < b, we may use the criterion of ˇCentsov14 to
conclude the required result.

We shall now construct the processes obtained from (X(t))t≥0 by conditioning
them to go through y at time t = T . The density ft,b is everywhere positive and con-
tinuous and so the ﬁnite dimensional conditional densities are deﬁned everywhere
and allow us to build the conditioned process. We wish to prove that the corre-
sponding probability measures can be deﬁned on the Skorokhod space D([0, T ] : W ),
and that they form a continuous family depending on the starting point x and the
ﬁnishing point y. This will follow from the ˇCentsov criteria in the usual manner if
we prove the following lemma.

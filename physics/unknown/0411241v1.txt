Abstract. The critical points of the two-layer Ising and Potts models for 
square 
lattice  have  been  calculated  with  high  precision  using 
probabilistic  cellular  automata  (PCA)  with  Glauber  alghorithm.  The 
critical temperature is calculated for the isotropic and symmetric 
case  (Kx=Ky=Kz=K),  where  Kx  and  Ky  are  the  nearest-neighbor 
interactions  within  each  layer  in  the  x  and  y  directions, 
respectively,  and  Kz  is  the  interlayer  coupling.  The  obtained 
results are 0.310 and 0.726 for two-layer Ising and Potts models, 
respectively, that are in good agreement with the accurate values 
reported by others. 

Introduction 

For many years, the lattice statistics has been the subject of intense research 
interests. Although, at zero magnetic field, there is an exact solution for the 2-
dimensional (2-D) Ising model [1,2], however, there is no such a solution for 
the  two-layer  Ising  and  Potts  models.  The  Potts  models  are  the  general 
extension of the Ising model with q-state spin lattice i.e., the Potts model with 
q  =  2  is  equivalent  to  the  Ising  model.  Although  we  do  not  know  the  exact 
solution of the two-dimensional Potts model at present time, a large amount of 
the  numerical  information  has  been  accumulated  for  the  critical  properties  of 
the  various  Potts  models.  For  further  information,  see  the  excellent  review 
written by Wu [3] or the references given by him.  

The  two-layer  Ising  model,  as  a  simple  generalization  of  the  2-D  Ising 
model  and  also  as  an  intermediate  model  between  the  2-D  and  3-D  Ising 

models, has long been studied [4-7] and several approximation methods have 
been applied to this model [8-14]. In the absence of exact solution, simulation 
methods such as Monte Carlo [15] are most important tools for computation of 
the critical properties of the various Ising and Potts models. 

In  addition  to  the  Monte  Carlo  method,  it  was  proposed  that  the  Cellular 
Automata (CA) could be a good candidate to simulate the Ising models [16]. In 
the  last  two  decade  a  large  amount  of  works  were  done  for  describing  Ising 
models  by  the  CA  approach  and  a  great  number  of  papers  and  excellent 
reviews were published [17-22]. Most of the works that have been done until 
now  are  focused  on  the  qualitative  description  of  various  Ising  and  Potts 
models or to introduce a faster algorithm. For example, the Q2R automaton as 
a fast algorithm was suggested which has been studied extensively [22-27]. It 
was so fast, because no random numbers must be generated at each step. But in 
the probabilistic CA, like Metropolis algorithm [28], generation of the random 
number  causes  to  reduce  the  speed  of  calculation,  even  though  it  is  more 
realistic for describing the Ising model.  

In  this  article,  at  the  first  section  we  have  used  probabilistic  CA  with 
Glauber algorithm [29] for calculating the critical temperature of the two-layer 
symmetric Ising model on the square grid. We used a large lattice size (2500 × 
2500)  in  simulation  in  order  to  reduce  the  finite  size  effects.  It  is  shown  that 
our  results  are  in  a  good  agreement  with  those  obtained  from  the  best 
numerical methods. In section 2 we have extended the method to the two-layer 
symmetric 3-state Potts model. The importance of this section is due to the fact 
that there is no well tabulated data for such a model.  

1. Two-Layer Ising Model 

Consider  a  two-layer  square  lattice  with  the  periodic  boundary  condition, 
r ×  sites and the 
p
each layer with p rows and r columns. Each layer has then 
=××2
number of the sites in the lattice is
. We consider the next nearest 
r
neighbor interactions as well, so the number of neighbor for each site is 5. In 
two-layer  Ising  model,  for  any  site  we  define  a  spin  variable 
the 
iσ
,()2(1
 where superscript 
)2(1

 denotes the layer number. We include the periodic boundary condition as

1.1    Method 

In  the  present  work,  we  considered  the  isotropic  ferromagnetic  and 
symmetric case i.e. Kx=Ky=Kz=K 0≥ . We have used a two-layer square lattice 
with  2500 × 2500 sites in each layer with the periodic boundary condition. The 
Glauber method [29] was used with checkerboard approach to update sites. For 
this purpose the surfaces of two layers are checkered same as each others. For 
updating the lattice, we use following procedure: after updating the first layer, 
the second layer could be updated.  The updating of the spins is based on the

The approach is as follow: first a random number is generated. If it is less 
+
ip ,  the  spin  of  the  site  (i,j)    is  up,  otherwise  (it  means  that  random 

+

than

number is greater than

ip ), it will be down.  

+

When we start CA with the homogeneous initial state (namely, all sites have 
spin  up  or  +1),  before  the  critical  point  (Kc),  the  magnetization  per  spin  (m) 
will  decay  rapidly  to  zero  and  fluctuate  around  it.  After  the  critical  point,  m 
will approach to a nonzero point and fluctuate around it; and with increasing of 
K,  the  magnetization  per  spin  will  increase.  But  at  the  critical  point,  m  will 
decay very slowly to the zero point and the fluctuation of the system will reach 
to  a  maximum.  For  each  K,  the  time  that  m  reaches  to  the  special  point  and 
starts  to  fluctuate  around  it  is  called  the  relaxation  time  (τ).  On  the  other 
words, the relaxation time is the time that the system is thermalized. The value 
of τcan be obtained from the graph of m vs. t (Fig. 1). One can see from these 
graphs that the relaxation time increases before critical point and reaches to a 
maximum  at  Kc,  but  after  the  critical  point,  τ  decreases  rapidly.  So,  in  the 
critical point, the system last a long time to stabilized. Hence, the critical point 
may be obtained from the graph of τvs. K (Fig. 2). The obtained critical point 
from this graph is 0.310 for the two-layer Ising model.  

In  our  approach,  we  have  calculated  the  thermodynamic  quantities  after 
thermalization of the lattice. In other words, first we let the system reaches to a 
stable state after some time step (t=τ), and then to be updated up to the end of 
the  automata  (t=50000).  For  example  to  calculate  the  average  value  of 
magnetization  per  spin  (<m>),  one  should  add  all  values  of  m  from  the 
relaxation  time  up  to  the  end  of  the  automata  (or  end  of  the  time  step)  and 
divide  the  result  to  number  of  steps.  The  other  way  for  calculation  of  the 
critical  point  is  the  usage  of  <m>.  By  drawing  the  graph  of  <m>  vs.  K,  we 
may also obtain Kc. Fig. 3 shows the results of such calculation. As it is seen, 
before  critical  point  (K<Kc),  <m>=0  and  after  that  (K>  Kc),  <m> ≠ 0.  The 
obtained  values  of  the  critical  point  from  this  approach  is  Kc  =0.310  for  the 
two-layer Ising model.  

For  calculation  of χfor  each  K,  first  we  have  calculated  the  value  of 
<− m

(
 in each time step. Then these values are averaged in a some way 
explained  above.  According  to  eq.  8  this  average  could  be  used  for 
computation of χ. Using eq. 9 for calculation of the specific heat (C), we have 
done  it  in  a  same  way  described  above.  Figures  4  and  5  show  the  graphs 
of χvs.  K  and  C  vs.  K,  respectively,  for  the  two-layer  Ising  model.  These 
graphs  are  the  other  ways  for  obtaining  the  critical  point.  The  maximum  of

these graphs indicates the critical point. The obtained value for Kc from these 
graphs is 0.310 for the two-layer Ising model.

Conclusion 

It was demonstrated that the high precision calculation of the critical point 
can  be  done  by  the  CA.  For  obtaining  the  fourth  and  further  digits  after  the 
decimal point by the CA, one must use a larger lattice and since the relaxation 
time  is  large  near  the  critical  point,  the  numbers  of  time  steps  must  be 
increased. For example, in order to compute the fourth digit of Kc in the two-
layer  Ising  model,  it  is  sufficient  to  increase  the  number  of  time  step  up  to  

300000 steps and draw the graph <m> vs. K .  The calculated  Kc is 0.3108 that 
is in good agreement with other numerical method [14].  

Although the extension of numerical methods for calculation of the critical 
properties  of  the  two-layer  3-state  Potts  model  is  a  difficult  task,  but  such 
extension  is  easy  in  cellular  automata  approach.  The  importance  of  this 
approach is due to the fact that there is no well tabulated data for the two-layer 
Potts model.

Abstract 

Electroporation of biological cell membranes is a phenomena that occurs almost universally at a 
transmembrane potential of approximately 1000 mV. Theories of pore formation have been 
proposed based on electrocompression (Crowley 1972, Malderelli and Steebe 1992 ), local 
membrane defects ( Abidor and Chizdhmazdev 1979, Weaver and Mintzer 1981, Sugar 1981), 
and  Statistical models  were proposed by (Sowers and Lieber 1986). However, these theories do 
not in general derive the form of the electric field within the pore. In this paper, we present a view 
that is useful in describing the biological membrane. We also derive an approximate functional 
form for the electric field in the region of a pore formed in the membrane. 
 

Introduction 

Biological cells exist in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, which is dependent on their function in 

the organism. Although, in general, the shape of a cell is determined by its special function in the 

organism, a great many of the cells are possessed of an amorphous shape. A consequence of 

the fluid-like nature of the cell membrane is its ability to adopt a different shape.  One of the most 

generally useful geometries that describe a wide range of cellular properties is that of a spherical 

shell. These cells may be partially embedded into a small pore in a material and made to assume 

an asymmetric dumbbell shape. Pores may be formed in the membrane by the application of an 

electric field of large enough magnitude across the membrane.  The cell membrane, which 

separates the interior of the cell from its surrounding, is composed of a lipid bilayer which is 

approximately 10 nm thick. This lipid bilayer is composed of long chain fatty acids with their 

hydrophobic ends apposed to form an interior region of the membrane, which possesses 

hydrophobic characteristics. The faces of the membrane are composed of hydrophilic polar 

groups.  

 

The pores formed in the membrane of the cells may be transient, or permanent in nature, 

depending on the characteristics of the applied field.  For relatively low field strengths, the pores 

formed may be very small and short-lived. For intermediate field strengths, the pores may be 

larger and remain for longer times. For large applied fields the pores may be permanent. 

A simple model of this arrangement is that of concentric spherical shells giving three regions. 

Region 1, has radius < R1, region 2 which has inner radius R1, and outer radius R2, and region 3 

which has radius > R2.  The three different regions of the shell namely region 1 with r < R1, region 

2 with R1 < r < R2 and region 3 with r > R2, have conductivities given by

σσσ
3

   ,
1

  ,

2

 respectively.  

The potential distribution when these concentric shells are placed in a uniform electric field, can 

be readily found in spherical coordinates by solving Laplaces equation with appropriately chosen 

boundary conditions. 

In order to determine the potential that exists in the region of a pore formed in the membrane, it is 

necessary to examine the cell at a closer level. This view corresponds to a point of view such that 

|r-R2| << R2, the radius of the cell. To a first approximation the cell membrane may be viewed as 

a flat sheet, lipid bi-layer. The poration of the membrane produces an opening in this sheet. We 

seek to determine the form of the electric field that exists in the region of the pore formed in the 

membrane by an application of a uniform external field. In this treatment, time dependent 

behaviors will not be considered. The external field is taken to be uniform in the z direction.

where, due to the azimuthal symmetry and the requirement of periodicity of the -(Q) solution, we

In addition to physically describing the membrane, the model used should also allow manipulable 

solutions of Laplace’s equation.  Of the various coordinate systems for which Laplace’s equation 

is separable, the Oblate Spheroidal Coordinate system was chosen to be the most useful for 

modeling the membrane as well as the pore formed in the membrane.

As with the solution in cylindrical coordinates, a determination of the coefficients that would 

produce a suitable solution is difficult since the boundary conditions are still complicated; thus we 

seek an alternative method of determining the potentials in the region of the pore and the 

membrane.

As an alternate solution, we make use of the conditions that are to be satisfied by the fields.  

These conditions may be derived from Maxwells equations and can be stated as

In the pore region of the membrane we seek to determine the electric field, and from the field 

boundary conditions, the field near the tip of the membrane.  The approach used is to calculate 

the circulation of the field around a closed loop in the region of the pore.  Since we are in the D.C. 

limit, the field is irrotational, thus 

.  In the region of the pore (region 1) the electric field

Conclusion  

We have derived the form of the electric field in the region of a pore formed in the membrane. 

Due to problems of directly obtaining the solution from Laplaces equation, we have adopted a 

different approach based on properties of the field. This approach allows us to derive a functional 

form for the electric field in the region of the pore.

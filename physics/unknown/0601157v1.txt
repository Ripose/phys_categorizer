Abstract  
 

In  this  article  we  describe  results  of  studies  of  a  photoelectron  backscattering  effect  in  vacuum  phototubes: 
classical photomultipliers (PMT) and hybrid phototubes (PH). Late pulses occurring in PMTs are attributed to the 
photoelectron  backscattering  and  distinguished  from  pulses  due  to  an  anode  glow  effect.  The  late  pulses  are 
measured  in  a  number  of  PMTs  and  HPs  with  various  photocathode  sizes  covering  1-50  cm  range  and  different 
types of the first dynode materials and construction designs. It is shown that the late pulses are a generic feature of 
all  vacuum  photodetectors  –  PMTs  and  PHs  and  they  don’t  deteriorate  dramatically  amplitude  and  timing 
responses of vacuum phototubes.

1. Introduction 
 

Vacuum  phototubes  are  used  widely 

in  an 
overwhelming majority of experiments in astroparticle 
and  high  energy  physics.  Precision  timing  of  vacuum 
phototubes  plays  a  crucial  role  in  defining  detectors 
angular  and  amplitude 
resolutions,  background 
suppression  etc.  Phototube  timing  performance  is  of 
particular  importance  in  case  of  experiments  dealing 
with  extremely  low  intensities  of  light  fluxes,  large-
scale Cherenkov experiments in particular. One of the 
most  strongly  influencing  effects  on  phototube  timing 
are  so  called  “late”  pulses    and  prepulses  [1-4].  The 
late  pulses  are  attributed 
the  photoelectron 
backscattering  effect  on  the  first  dynodes  of  classical 
PMTs  or  the  anode  structures  of  HPDs  [2,3].  This 
effect smears not only the timing response of vacuum 
phototubes but their amplitude resolution too [5].  
 
2. Late pulses 
 

to 

It is still important to make distinction between the 
late  pulses  and  afterpulses.  Afterpulses  stem  from 
ionisation  of  the  residual  gas  atoms  and  the  atoms 
adsorbed by the first dynode surface, or luminescence 
of the dynodes and the residual gas  [6-8]. Afterpulses 
are always correlated with the main pulses. The delay 
time of the ion-feedback afterpulses for classical PMTs 
stretches  from  hundred  nanoseconds  to  dozens  of 
microseconds.  In  our  study  the  afterpulses  nearest  to

The late pulses are in fact a part of the main pulses of 
the phototube’s response but they are only delayed by less 
than  ten  nanoseconds  in  small  phototubes  and  several 
dozens  of  nanoseconds  in  large  phototubes.  As  it  was 
mentioned  above  it  is  supposed  that  the  late  pulses  arise 
from  photoelectron  backscattering 
(elastically  or 
inelastically) on the first dynodes of classical PMTs or the 
anode  structures  of  HPDs  (silicon  diodes  or  luminescent 
screens).  A  photoelectron  hitting  the  first  dynode  may 
be    backscattered    even    without    liberating    any 
secondary electrons. In turn  backscattered photoelectrons

then 
accelerated  again  towards  the  electron  multiplying 
system producing finally the phototube’s output signal. 
Thus  the  resulting  delay  time  may  be  up  to  twice  the 
photoelectron  transit  time  between  the  photocathode 
and  the  electron  multiplying  system  (the  first  dynode 
in case of PMT). We introduced in our previous work

The  typical  photoelectron  transit  time  distribution 
of  the  8”  EMI9350  phototube  is  shown  in  Fig.1.  The 
distribution  was  measured  with  the  discriminator 
threshold of 0.01 p.e.. The first peak of the distribution 
is  due  to  prepulses  [3].  The  second  “main”  peak 
(between 50 and 70 ns) corresponds to the main pulses. 
The  time  interval  between  the  prepulses  peak  and  the 
main  peak  corresponds  to  the  photoelectron  transit 
time  from  the  photocathode  to  the  first  dynode  tc-1d. 
The  part  of  the  distribution  with  time  entries  of  more 
than 75 ns is explained largely by the late pulses. The 
broad peak around 110 ns with tail up to 140 ns is very 
inelastically  backscattered 
likely  due 
photoelectrons. The third rather sharp peak at 150 ns is 
attributed 
backscattered 
photoelectrons.  The  time  interval  between  the  second 
and third peaks amounts roughly to twice the value of 
tc-1d.

and  R3809U  respectively.  The  former  is  a  PMT  module

The distributions are borrowed from [9]. As in the case of 

for Zeff = 54, η is larger than 40% [13, 14]. The questions 
arise.  Why  is  Klate  so  small  in  comparison  with  η? Why 
Klate  does  not  increase  with  increasing  Zeff?  For  the 
Quasar-370 phototube, the situation is very intriguing: the 
value  of  Zeff  is  rather  high  (39)  but  Klate  =  0!  It  is 
interesting  that  there  is  even  no  peak  due  to  the 
photoelectron  elastic  backscattering.  So  where  did 
backscattered photoelectrons disappear?

distinctly seen. The late pulses contribution to the total 
distributions  is  practically  the  same  as  for  classical 
PMTs.  In  Fig.3  four  distributions  measured  with  four 
thresholds of the discriminator are shown.

One can reconcile experimental data on Klate and η by 
recalling 
(SEM) 
the  secondary  electron  emission 
phenomenological  models  and  experimental  data  on 
SEM.  The  overwhelming  bulk  of  so  called  “genuine” 
secondary  electrons  is  produced  by  the  backscattered 
photoelectrons rather than the direct ones. So the more the 
backscattering  probability  coefficient  η  the  more  the 
secondary emission coefficient σ [13,14]. The absence of 
the  late  events  peak  in  the  single  photoelectron  transit 
is

explained  by  the  fact  that  the  inelastically  backscattered 
photoelectrons  produce 
the 
luminescent screen to be registered by the small PMT of 
the  phototube.  The  elastic  backscattering  probability 
depends  on  the  initial  energy  of  electrons  as  Kel  ~  E-A, 
where A is a constant,: at E = 25 keV the value of Kel is 
less than 0.1% [13].

The  single  photoelectron  charge  distribution  of  the 
R1463 tiny classical PMT is presented in Fig.7. It is, in a 
sense, a quite unique PMT. One can see not only the very 
nice  single  photoelectron  peak  around  channel  #140  but 
also  peaks  generated  by  prepulses  on  the  first  and  even 
second dynodes, the second and first peaks on the left side

The data of our study are listed in table 1. One can see 
from  the  data  that,  regardless  of  the  phototube  types, 
first dynode materials etc, the values of the late pulses 
probability coefficient Klate are rather small and do not 
exceed  2%.  On  the  other  hand,  the  backscattering 
probability coefficient η depends strongly on Zeff  and,

them is about 12 ns. Moreover it should be reminded here 
that  pulses  due  to  the  anode  afterglow  are  most  likely 
suppressed  completely  by 
the 
discriminator  used  in  the  measurements.  Indeed,  the 
discriminator  threshold  in  the  measurements  was  rather 
low (~0.01) p.e. so the photoelectrons initiating the anode 
glow were very likely registered and the electronic system 
was  insensitive  to  delayed  pulses  in  the  time  domain  of 
200 ns. Moreover from Fig.2 it is clear that the late events 
arrive  conspicuously  earlier  than  the  doubled  overall 
transit  time  of  PMTs.  So  it  seems  one  can  say  with 
confidence  that  the  late  events  peak  is  not  due  to  the 
anode glow.

It  is  worth  noting  that  there  is  a  non-negligible 
probability  Kmiss  for  the  backscattered  photoelectrons 
to  miss  hitting  the  first  dynode  a  second  time 
depending  on  the  transverse  momentum  and  the 
electric  field  configuration  in  the  front–end  geometry 
of  the PMTs. As  it  might  be  inferred from  the  results 
reported here, it seems plausible that the value of Kmiss 
is  quite  small.  It  is  rather  difficult  to  estimate  Kmiss 
experimentally  but  it  can  be  done  by  some  computer 
simulations.  To  know  exactly  the  value  of  Kmiss  is  of 
particular importance because it is closely related with 
the  determination  of  the  effective  quantum  efficiency 
in vacuum phototubes. 
 
III. Anode glow 
 

It  has  long  been  known  that  electrons  in  classical 
PMTs  induce  light  emission  in  the  last  cascades  of 
dynode  systems  –  the  “anode  glow”  [15].  In  some 
cases, photons of the glow could generate peaks in the 
photoelectron transit time distributions very similar to 
the late pulses peaks but the time interval between the 
main peak and the peak due to the anode glow should 
be  equal  to  the  overall  electron  transit  time  of  PMT 
[16]. 

To  distinguish  the  photoelectron  backscattering 
peak  from  the  anode  glow  peak  we  measured  the 
anode glow directly by using the small PMT (XP2020) 
viewing  right  at  the  anode  region  of  the  PMT  under 
study  (EMI9350)  from  outside.  It  is  known  that  the 
most part of the emission spectrum of the anode glow 
lies  in  the  spectral  region  from  400  nm  to  700  nm  so 
that  the  PMT’s  glass  bulb  is  transparent  to  the  anode 
glow  photons  [17].  In  Fig.8  the  single  photoelectron 
transit  time  distribution  of  the  PMT  under  study  and 
the anode glow kinetics recorded by the small PMT are 
shown.  Here  all  existing  time  delays  are  taken  into 
account.  It  is  clearly  seen  that  peaks  due  to  the 
photoelectron backscattering and the anode glow don’t 
coincide with each other. The time difference between

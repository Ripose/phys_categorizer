Abstract:   

In a recent experiment [1], it was observed that a sequence of two standing wave square 

pulses can split a BEC at rest into +/- 2 h k diffraction orders with almost 100% efficiency. 

By  truncating  the  Raman-Nath  equations  to  a  2-state  model,  we  provide  an  intuitive 

picture that explains this double square pulse beamsplitter scheme. We further show it is 

possible to optimize a standingwave multi square pulse sequence to efficiently diffract an 

atom  at  rest  to  symmetric  superposition  of  +/-  2n h k  diffraction  order  with  n>1.  The 

approach  is  considered  to  be  qualitatively  different  from  the  traditional  light  pulse 

schemes in the Bragg or the Raman-Nath  region,  and can be extended to more complex 

atomic  optical  elements  that  produce  various  tailored  output  momentum  states  from  a 

cold atom source.

Introduction 

For  atom  interferometry  it  is  useful  to  have  large  angle  beamsplitters  that  put  the  input 

atom  wavepackets  into  superposition  of  two  narrow  momenta  distributions  with  large 

momentum  separations.  The  narrow  distributions  are  required  to  obtain  good  fringe 

contrast. The large momentum separation not only helps to spatially resolve the two arms 

of  the  interferometer  but  also  reduces  the  effects  of  stray  fields.  The  efforts  toward 

achieving  a  matterwave  large  angle  beamsplitter  with  light  pulses  may  be  divided  into 

two  categories,  depending  on  whether  or  not  the  external  motions  of  the  atoms  are 

separable  from  the  internal  states.  In  the  first  approach,  the  atoms  have  to  be  in  the 

superposition  of  two  different  internal  states  that  are  associated  with  two  different 

external motional states. A predetermined number of photon momenta can be transferred 

to  atoms  by  successively  inducing  the  transitions  between  the  two  states  while 

alternatively changing the direction of the light fields [2-4]. In the second approach, the 

atoms stay in a single (adiabatic) internal state throughout the interaction, and the motion 

of atoms can be described by a scalar matterwave in a periodic light shift potential [5]. To 

narrow  the  output  momentum  transfer  spreading  in  the  second  approach,  either  the  light 

shift  potential  is  carefully  designed  [6,  7],  or  the  initial  momentum  of  the  atom  is 

controlled to meet the Bragg resonance [8-10].     

For interferometry purposes, if the atoms leaving the beamsplitter in different momentum 

states  are  also  in  different  internal  states,  the  energy  difference  between  these  internal 

states can contribute to the phase error in an interferometer, since the energy difference is 

 

2 

usually  sensitive  to  the  stray  fields.  With  multi-photon  Bragg  scattering,  a  single 

frequency standing wave light field can cleanly split the cold atoms into two diffraction 

orders with large momentum separation, while throughout the process the atoms are in a 

single (adiabatic) internal state. The authors in [11] suggest that with the development of 

cold  atom  technology,  the  beamsplitter  based  on  the  Bragg  scattering  could  be  a 

promising alternative to those work with multi atomic internal levels. 

Manipulation  of  matterwave  with  an  off-resonant  standingwave  light  pulse  is  a  subject 

that  has  been  extensively  studied  [12].  A  Kapitza-Dirac  pulse  can  be  considered  as 

complimentary to a Bragg pulse, since the light pulse duration is so short that the motion 

of atom during the pulse is ignorable (Raman-Nath, or thin lens limit). A Kapitza-Dirac 

pulse  shares  the  common  advantage  of  light  pulse  beamsplitter  schemes  work  in  the 

Raman-Nath  limit  (input  velocity  insensitive/achromatic),  thus  is  advantageous  if  a 

collimated atom source is not available [13]. However, the multi- momenta output limits 

the  achievable  fringe  contrast  in  the  scheme.  On  the  other  hand,  if  a  collimated  atom 

source  is  available,  the  light  pulse  may  be  designed  to  populate  only  certain  output 

diffraction orders that are relevant for a particular experimental purpose [14]. 

The work in this paper is motivated by a recent experimental discovery [1]: A sequence 

of  two  square  shaped  standing  wave  light  pulses  can  split  a  BEC  at  rest  into  +/-  2 h k 

diffraction orders with almost 100% efficiency. Different from a Bragg pulse, the double 

square  pulse  transfers  not  only  momentum,  but  also  energy  to  the  atoms.  On  the  other 

hand,  the  scheme  transfers  momentum  to  the  atom  in  a  highly  controlled  manner,  in 

 

3 

contrast to a Kapitza-Dirac pulse.   

The first part of the paper is direct connected to the experimental discovery. By mapping 

the  dynamics  of  the  matter  wave  onto  a  two-state  system,  we  exp lain  how  a  double 

square pulse is able to diffract atom at rest to symmetric n=+/–1 diffraction orders with 

almost  100%  efficiency.  Numerical  simulations  are  used  to  support  the  analysis.  The 

analysis is also shown to be in quantitative agreement with the experimental discovery [1]. 

In the second part of the paper, we describe matter wave dynamics under a sequence of 

square  shaped  light  pulses  from  a  multi-path  interference  point  of  view.  We  then 

numerically optimize the double square pulses as 2nh k beamsplitters for n from 1 to 6 

and  show  the  diffraction  efficiency  to  a  desired  diffraction  order  can  be  significantly 

higher  than  that  achievable  by  a  Kapitza-Dirac  pulse.  We  expect  the  experimental 

demonstration of these 2nh k beamsplitters (with n>1) in the near future. 

We  note  that  the  related  beamsplitter  schemes  with  standing  wave  light  field  are 

developed in [15-17]. For example, it is shown in [16] that in the “pump-probe” geometry, 

the Bragg scattering by two opposite moving standing waves can be continued n times to 

put  atoms  into  a  symmetric  superposition  of  +/-2n h k  diffraction  order.  However,  in 

[15~17]  resonance  and  adiabacity  are  the  key  elements  to  narrow  the  diffraction  to  a 

specific order, while here the same goal is achieved by properly timing the square pulses 

to  control  the  multi-path  interferences.  We  consider  the  work  described  here  as  a  novel 

strategy in the standing wave control of atomic motion.

I. 2h k symmetric beamsplitter   

We  begin  our  discussion  with  a  physical  model  based  on  a  two-level  atom  interacting 

with  a  far-off  resonant  light  field  so  that  the  excited  state  of  the  atom  is  adiabatically 

eliminated. The atom is thus described by a free scalar matterwave and the sinusoidal AC 

stark  shift  is  the  only  interaction  introduced  by  the  classical  standing  wave  light  field. 

The motion of the atom can be described by the coupled Raman-Nath equations (RNE). 

We  cut  off  the  RNE  to  include  only  the  n=0  and  n=+/–1  diffraction  orders.  The  model 

provides  an  intuitive  picture  that  explains  why  a  sequence  of  two  square  pulses  can 

convert an atom at rest to the symmetric superposition of +/– 2 h k diffraction orders with 

almost  100%  efficiency.   We  then  integrate  the  full  RNE  numerically  to  confirm  the 

conclusion from the simple model.

In the next section, we will discuss how to transfer the population from C0=1 to C+=1 by 

a double pulse sequence while keeping

I.2 Optimization of the 2-pulse for 2-photon transition   

In nuclear magnetic resonance experiments one often inverts the spin of a nucleus with a 

sequence of weak rf pulses rather than a single strong pulse to avoid complications from 

other dimensions in the Hilbert space. Here we have similar problem: we want to invert 

the  population  of  C0  and  C+  in  (5)  while  keeping 

)t(

<<

32w

r

  so  that  the  cut-off  we 

made  to  give  (5)  is  justified.  The  simplest  way  to  do  this  is  to  use  a  compound  pulse 

composed  of  two  square  pulses.  The  1st  square  pulse  can  put  the  system  onto  an  equal 

superposition of C0 and C+. After the re-phasing of C0 and C+ during the free evolution, 

the population can be completely transferred from |C0|2=1 to |C+|2=1 by the 2nd pulse. This 

is explained in Fig.1 where we introduce the Bloch sphere to describe the evolution of the 

matterwave states. This simple 2-state model gives the optimal parameters of the double 

square  pulse  for  the  beamsplitting.  They  are:  (a)  the  square  pulses  should  be  with 

amplitude 

=

m

r22

, (b) the pulse durations for the square pulses should be chosen as 

,  and  (c)  the  interval  between  the  two  pulses  should  be  chosen  as 

.  Here  n1  and  n2  are  two  integers.  Notice  the  optimal  parameters  only

2

see  that  the  double  square  pulse  process  here  can  almost  quantitatively  be  described  by 

the  2-state model when 

  is  small:  A  double  pulse  with  the  parameters  prescribed  by 

1

the  simple  model  almost  completely  inverts  the  population.  In  the  full  model,  however, 

the optimal values on the 

  plane  are  periodically  distributed double peaks instead 

t – 2

1

of  single  peaks.  The  correction  is  due  to  the  finite  coupling  to  higher  diffraction  orders 

during 

.  The  numerical  simulation  indicates  that  the  optimal  conversion  efficiency  is 

1

very close to unity with error only of order O(10-4). 

I.3 The initial velocity dependence of the 2 h k symmetric beamsplitter 

In this section we consider the influence of small initial velocity for the performance of 

double  square  pulse  that  is  optimized  for  k=0  velocity  class.  The  initial  kinetic  energy 

term in equation (4) introduces the coupling between the symmetric state labeled by C+ 

and  anti-symmetric  state  labeled  by  C-.  For  k<<k0,  the  amplitude  at  C- after  the  double 

pulse  is  of  order

Obviously, for beamsplitting purposes, both n1 and n2 should be chosen as zeros such that 

the  effect  of  the  initial  velocity  spreading  is  minimized.  This  requires  the  initial  atom 

sample to be cooled to sub-recoil temperatures.   

We  have  also  numerically  integrated  equation  (4)  to  investigate  the  velocity  dependence 

of  the  beamsplitter  pulse.  The  results  agree  with  our  analysis,  some  of  which  are 

summarized in the first graph of Fig. 4.   

II. Extension to 2nh k symmetric beamsplitter with n>1 

From part I we see it is possible to symmetrically split atom at rest to +/– 2 h k resulting 

in a 4 h k momentum separation. In this section, we aim to extend the idea and explore the 

possibility of symmetric splitting into higher diffraction orders. Unfortunately, the simple 

2-state picture in the last section cannot be applied here since more than 3 motional states 

should be included in the discussion. In this section, we first consider the motion of atom 

subject to multi square pulses from a multi-path  interferome tric point of view. Then we 

numerically  optimize  the  double  square  pulses  for  2nh k  splitting  with  n  from  1  to  6, 

which are shown to be with efficiencies significantly higher than those achievable with a 

Kapitza-Dirac pulse.

II.1 Matter wave dynamics in a square pulsed standing wave light field 

In the physical model described by equation (1), for atom in a standing wave light field 

with  slowly  varying  intensity

)(t

,  the  evolution  of  matterwave  can  be  described  in  its 

eigenstate  basis,  e.g.,  the  instantaneous  Bloch  basis  associated  with 

)(t

.  Sudden 

switching of light intensity to a different level is described by the diabatic projection of 

matter wave onto the new adiabatic basis.   

This can be summarized into following two equations:

Equation  (7)  describes  the  evolution  of  different  adiabatic  states  during  which  light

approximated  by  a  closed  N  level  system),  we  expect  the  output  of  the  “multi-path 

interferometer  sequence”  can  be  optimized  for  the  population  of  a  specific  symmetric 

diffraction order. 

In  this  paper  we  resort  to  numerical  method  in  searching  for  an  optimized  multi-square 

pulse sequence for +/-2n h k splitting. Limited by our computing resource, our simulation 

is  restricted  to  double  pulses  with  4  adjustable  parameters: 

– common amplitude of

the two pulses, 

t – duration of the first pulse, 

– interval between the two pulses, and

t – duration of the second pulse (See fig. 3).

II.2 Numerical optimization of +/-2n h k splitting with double square pulses 

Parallel  to  the  discussion  in  part  I,  the  optimization  is  taken  out  for  k=0  velocity  class. 

The range of the 4 parameters in optimization was chosen according to following criteria: 

to  transfer  population  from  zeroth  order  to  nth  order, 

  for  2nh k  splitting  has  to  be 

m

comparable  to  the  relative  detuning 

2n4 w but  not  too  large  such  that  the  population 

diffuses away to even higher orders. The time parameters are restricted within the range

 for n=1 to 6 (See Fig. 3). Table 1 

lists  the  optimal  transfer  efficiencies  we  get  by  this  simple  optimization  scheme,  which 

are  significantly  larger  than  those  provided  by  a  single  Kapitza-Dirac  pulse  (the 

comparison  is  restricted  to  k=0  velocity  class).  We  also  varied  the  4  parameters  of  the 

2-pulse  around  the  optimized  value  in  the  numerical  simulations  and  looked  at  the 

sensitivity of the efficiency to these parameters. The results are also included in Table 1. 

Having considered the case  where  the  atom  sample  has  no  initial  velocity,  we  will  now 

consider the case where the atom sample has some initial velocity spread.  In particular, 

we  fix  the  double  square  pulse  with  parameters  optimized  for  k=0  from  the  simulation 

and  numerically  integrate  equation  (2)  that  describe  the  velocity  class  with  initial 

momentum koff. The output momentum distribution is plotted in fig. 4 with respect to koff. 

The results show that the optimized double square can address the atom distributions with 

momentum  spread  smaller  than  a  pulse-related  value kD

.  This  is  also  summarized  in 

We emphasize that all the simulations in this work are based on the double square pulses 

with switching on and off in steps. The results in this paper remain valid if the switching 

time  is  finite  but  much  smaller  than  the  associated  external  motional  time  scale,  e.g, 

, so that the diabaticity during the switching is satisfied. Typically the atomic recoil 

frequency  is  of  order  kHz,  thus  the  switching  time  is  well  within  current  light  pulse 

generation technology.

III Discussion 

The  numerical  optimizations  in  Part  II  have  been  restricted  to  the  double  square  pulse 

configuration. However, we expect the optimal efficiency for 2nh k splitting at large n be 

further  improved  with  a  pulse  sequence  composed  of  more  than  two  square  pulses.  We 

also  expect  the  optimization  can  be  taken  out  analytically  with  the  help  from  a  deeper 

understanding of 

WkE
;(

  and 

)

WkA
;(

,'

  in equation (7, 8). 

)

The 2nh k symmetric beamsplitter discussed here is just one example that the motion of 

the  atom  wavefunction  described  by  equation  (1)  can  be  controlled  by  adjusting  the 

intensity  of  the  standing  wave  light  field

)t(

.  In  this  work  the  optimization  of  the 

multi-square pulses has been considered for the diffraction of atoms to a single symmetric 

diffraction  order.  However,  the  optimization  can  also  be  taken  out  for  a  more  general 

output  momentum  distribution,  which  may  be  relevant  for  a  particular  experimental 

purpose.  For  example,  it  can  be  shown  that  the  signal  of  the  “contrast  interferometer” 

described  in  [14]  is  optimized  if  the  atoms  are  in  the  equal  superposition  of  0  and 

symmetric  +/-2 h k  diffraction  orders  during  the  free  propagation.  This  momentum 

distribution  can  not  be  easily  achieved  using  a  single  Kaptiza-Dirac  or  a  Bragg  pulse; 

however this distribution can be achieved with the multi- square pulse scheme  here.    Our 

numerical simulations show that the desired state can be produced by an optimal single 

square pulse with fidelity (the mode square of the inner product between the optimal state 

and  the  desired  state)  >99.6%.  More  generally,  an  equal  superposition  of  0  and  the 

symmetric +/-2n h k diffraction orders with n‡ 1 has been numerically optimized with the 

 

13

W
double  pulse  configuration  (with  the  procedures  the  same  as  described  in  Part  II),  with 

optimal  fidelity  found  to  be  >99.99%,  >99.8%,  >99.0%,  >92.5%  for  n=1,  2,  3,  4 

respectively.   

 

 

 

Throughout the discussion above we assume the nodes of the standing wave are fixed in 

space.  If  the  relative  phase  between  the  two  traveling  waves  (that  forms  the  standing 

wave) is adjustable, equation (1) has to be modified as:

Thus two time-dependent functions 

)t(

  and 

)(tf

 can be adjusted to control the motion 

of atom. We note that the work described in [15-17] provides examples of controlling the 

motion  of  atoms  by  adjusting  both 

)t(

  and 

)(tf

.  Compared  with  the  beamsplitter 

schemes proposed in [15-17], the scheme here only requires a standing wave with fixed 

nodes, which corresponds to the simplest possible standing wave setup (traveling wave + 

mirror). This is favorable in situations where simplicity and robustness are important.   

In conclusion, we have described and numerically studied a ne w technique that efficiently 

splits  atoms  at  rest  into  symmetric  diffraction  orders  using  double  square  pulses  with 

optimized strength and intervals. We presented a simple and intuitive picture that explains 

the recent experimental discovery [1] and describes why the technique is effective for the 

2-photon  transition  case.  We  further  generally  interpret  the  high  efficiency  of  the 

beamsplitter scheme as a consequence of pre-designed  multi-path interferences between 

14

different  adiabatic  diffraction  orders.  This  work  represents  an  extension  of  the  field  of 

coherent  control  for  atoms,  resulting  in  more  efficient  momentum  transfer  than  single 

light pulse acting in the Raman-Nath regime. We expect a more complete description of 

optimal coherent control in system described by the Raman-Nath equations with square 

pulses.  The  beamsplitter  scheme  here  can  be  extended  to  more  complex  atomic  optical 

elements that produce various tailored output momentum states from a cold atom source.

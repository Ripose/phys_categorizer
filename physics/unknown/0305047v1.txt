Abstract. In more than one spatial dimension, resonant linear conversion from one wave type to
another  can  have  a  more  complex  geometry  than  the  familiar  ‘avoided  crossing’  of  one-
dimensional problems.  In previous work [1] we have shown that helical ray shapes are generic
in a mathematical sense.  Here we briefly describe how the local field structure can be computed.

INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS

Resonant  conversion  between  various  wave  types  is  exploited  in  RF  heating
schemes  for  fusion  plasmas.    Such  conversion  can  occur  in  nonuniform  plasmas
where, for some spatial position x0 and for a frequency ω0, two wave types ‘a’ and ‘b’
can  have  nearly  equal  wave  vectors  ka~  kb~  k0.  The  resonance  condition  implies  a
matching of the local phase velocities, but still allows the two waves to have different
group  velocities  and  polarizations.    Thus,  the  process  cannot  be  reduced  to  one
dimension, even locally, and the possibility of new physics arises.  This is discussed
more fully in [1-3].

In  a  separate  paper  [1],  we  have  considered  the  question  of  what  ray
geometries  might  be  ‘generic’  in  multi-dimensions,  and  how  the  WKB  connection
coefficients  can  be  calculated.    We  define  the  meaning  of  ‘generic’  conversion  just
after Eq. (7).  This line of research is similar in spirit to the one-dimensional work of
Littlejohn  and  Flynn  [4].      In  [1]  we  show  that  in  systems  with  two  or  three  spatial
dimensions  (implying  that  the  ray  phase  space  (x,k)  is  four-  or  six-dimensional,
respectively),  the  ray  geometry  in  conversion  regions  cannot  be  purely  hyperbolic.
Instead, it is generically a combination of hyperbolic motion in one two-dimensional
subspace  (analogous  to  a  one-dimensional  ‘avoided  crossing’  or  ‘tunneling’  region)
and  elliptical  motion  in  another.    Hence,  the  combined  motion  is  helical.    Such  a
combination of behaviors is, of course, not possible in the one-dimensional conversion
problem.  This result was independently derived using a different approach by Colin
de Verdiere [5].

In  [2]  a  tutorial  introduction  is  given  to  ray-based  analysis  of  multi-
dimensional  conversion,  and  in  [1]  we  show  that  generic  ray  motion  in  multi-
dimensional conversion is helical.  Here we sketch the calculation of the wave field for
helical conversion.  Details will be provided in a longer paper.

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

Summation over repeated indices is implied.  We assume that the plasma has
two spatial dimensions for simplicity, but note that the approach can be generalized to
higher  dimensions.    In  addition,  the  WKB  connection  coefficients  do  not  depend  on
the  number  of  spatial  dimensions,  but  simply  on  the  fact  that  only  two  waves  are
undergoing conversion.

We assume that the wave equation is conservative and can be derived from an
action  principle.    Using  methods  described  in  [2]  we  convert  (1)  into  the  form  of  a
partial differential equation:

Our  goal  is  to  solve  (2)  subject  to  some  specified  initial/boundary  conditions.    A
standard  tool  for  this  analysis  is  the  WKB  method.    WKB  methods  break  down  in
conversion  regions  and  must  be  augmented  by  a  local  treatment  which  provides  an
algorithm for calculating the WKB connection coefficients, as described below.

Because the polarizations of (3) are the  uncoupled ones, and because the conversion
point  lies  on  the  dispersion  surface  for  both  uncoupled  waves,  the  constant  terms  of
the diagonal elements Dαα and Dββ are zero, while the off-diagonal term is typically a
non-zero  (complex)  coupling  constant  η.    In  prior  work  [2,6],  we  assumed  that  the
dominant  terms  in  the  vicinity  of  the  conversion  point  were  given  by  the  first  order
corrections  to  the  wave  operator  along  the  diagonal.    This  is,  strictly  speaking,  only
correct  if  the  coupling  constant  is  non-zero  in  the  conversion  region  (not  just  at  the

Using an extension of methods described in [3] and more recent results from [1], it is
possible to recast (5) into:

Here q1 and q2 are new ray phase space coordinates that are linear combinations of the
old x and k, and γ and Ω are constants.  Note that Ω is the rate of rotation about the
conversion  point  of  the  elliptical  part  of  the  ray  orbit,  while  γ  is  the  rate  of
exponentiation  of  the  hyperbolic  part  [1].    Note  also  that  the  diagonal  operators
commute with the off-diagonal ones.  We can now define a generic conversion to be
one where all terms in the matrix operator of (8) are of equal importance.

Thus, the α and β subspaces have decoupled.  From the form of (11) it is seen that the
q1-  and  q2-dependences  separate.  Further  analysis  shows  that  the  q1-dependence
involves  a  parabolic  cylinder-like  equation  (though  not  self-adjoint),  and  the  q2-
dependence  involves  a  self-adjoint  equation  like  that  of  a  quantum  harmonic
oscillator.  The  separation  constant  plays  the  role  of  an  effective  coupling  constant
(more precisely, the magnitude squared of the coupling constant). The general solution
of (11) is a linear superposition of terms involving products of parabolic cylinder-type
functions and harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions, with each term in the series having a
different separation constant. The matching to incoming and outgoing WKB waves is
done by first computing the expansion coefficients by fitting at large negative values
of  q1  to  the  incoming  WKB  wave.  Then,  using  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  the
parabolic cylinder functions at large positive values of q1, the outgoing WKB wave is
calculated.

At the level of the ray picture [2], we find the following result: the incoming
WKB wave is a family of rays, with an amplitude, phase and polarization assigned to
each.  The entire family of incoming rays follow helical orbits with helicity κ=Ω/γ as
they  pass  through  the  conversion  region  and  connect  smoothly  onto  the  family  of
outgoing converted rays.  The conversion coefficient provides the amplitude and phase
assigned to each of the outgoing converted rays.  The transmitted family of rays also
follows  helical  orbits.    They  each  are  paired  with  an  incoming  ray  and  assigned  an
amplitude  and  phase  given  by  multiplication  of  the  data  on  the  incoming  ray  by  the

transmission  coefficient.  Except  for  that  small  set  of  rays  with  effective  coupling
constant  nearly  zero  (which  generates  an  outgoing  Gaussian  beam)  the  transmission
and  conversion  coefficients  for  each  ray  are  identical  to  those  obtained  in  [3]  since
they depend only upon the asymptotics of parabolic cylinder functions.  This will be
elaborated in a longer paper.  We note that similar results were previously obtained by
Littlejohn and Flynn [7].

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We  have  briefly  described  results  recently  obtained  concerning  resonant
conversion  of  linear  waves  in  multiple  spatial  dimensions.    Our  goal  has  been  to
understand generic behavior, rather than analyzing a particular physical model.  The
search for generic results, true for ‘typical’ representatives of a family of systems, can
lead  to  very  general  results.    However,  we  have  found  that  magnetized  plasmas  are
typically  not  generic  in  the  sense  we  use  here.    This  is  because  the  gyro-orbits  of
magnetized  particles  exhibit  symmetry  around  the  local  magnetic  field.  There  are
various ways in which genericity might be obtained; for example strong shear flows or
fully three-dimensional gyro-orbits associated with complex magnetic field geometry
might break the symmetry which makes magnetized plasmas nongeneric.  This is work
in progress.

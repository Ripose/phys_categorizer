Abstract

Classical disease models use a mass action term as the interaction between infected 

and susceptible people in separate patches.  We derive the equations when this 
interaction is a migration of people between patches.  The results model what happens 
when a new population is moved into a region with endemic disease.

The spread of infectious disease in a population can be modeled by a set of 
ordinary differential equations that describe the rate at which the populations of susceptible, 
exposed, infected, and recovered depend on the number of people in those categories 
and a set of parameters that model the infectious spread and recovery of that disease [1,2].  
In the simplest form of this model we deal only with the number of susceptible, S, and 
infected individuals I, namely:

d S
dt

dI

where µ is the birthrate at which new susceptibles are added to the population, N is the total 
number of people, (b/N) is the contact rate, and g is the rate at which infected people 
recover.  Recovered individuals are assumed to be permanently immune and for 
populations of constant size may be neglected.  A central assumption in these models is 
that the rate of new infections is proportional to the mass action term (b/N)IS.

These models assume that the infected and susceptible people are perfectly well 
mixed at every instant in time.  An increasingly important question in epidemiology is how 
to extend these classical formulations to adequately describe the spatial heterogeneity in 
the distribution of susceptible and infected people and in the parameters of the spread of 
the infection that is observed in both experimental data and computer simulations [3-5].  
This has been done previously by modeling the people as organized into separate 
patches of different sizes and assuming that the rate of new infections in patch k due to the 
infected people in patch j also has the form (bkj/Nk)IjSk.  That is, the coupling between the 
patches has been assumed to be a nonlinear, mass action term.  Such coupling, along with 
seasonal driving, has been shown to excite long period, small amplitude oscillations in both 
deterministic and stochastic settings [6].

Here we propose a new approach to compute the effects of the spatial 

heterogeneity and the spread of infection between different patches of people.  First, we 
describe how the parameters of the spread of infection are likely to scale with the number of 
people in a patch.  This makes it possible to compute the number of susceptible and 
infected people at steady state and compare those results from sets of patches with 
different distributions of population sizes.

Second, instead of the classical mass action approach, we model the spread of 

infection between the patches as the migration, that is a flux, of susceptible and infected 
people between the patches.  We show that this new flux-based approach is useful in 
computing the steady state and dynamical properties of the spread of infection through 
different patches.  We use it to compute how the migration of people between the patches 

page 2

alters the steady state number of susceptible and infected people in a distribution of 
patches of different sizes.  We show, perhaps surprisingly, that the migration of infected 
people changes the steady state number of infected people in each patch, but not the 
steady state total number of infected people in all the patches.  We then use the flux-
based approach to compute the dynamical behavior of patches when the onset of 
migration occurs at different time scales.  These results may be useful in understanding what 
happens when a new population is introduced into a region with endemic disease.  We 
show that epidemics result when the onset of migration is rapid compared to natural time 
scale of the patches.  In models with two patches we determine how the maximum number 
of people infected in the epidemic depends on the onset time scale of the migration.  In 
models with 20 patches, we show that this epidemic can appear to travel as a wave 
spreading through the patches.

Eqs. (1-2) are based on the assumption that the entire population is homogenous.  

In a real population, it is more likely that an infected person will spread the disease to 
nearby susceptibles, while further away there will remain homogenous pools of non-
infected susceptibles.  Thus, there will be islands of both susceptible and infected people.  
The spread of the disease will depend on the complex geometry of the sizes of these 
regions and the borders between them.  This patchiness of susceptibles is analogous to 
diffusion limited chemical reactions in a tank reactor, such as A + B -> C [7].  As the A’s and 
B’s interact in a region they are converted to C’s except for excess A’s or B’s.  Thus, as 
time goes on, increasingly large regions of A’s, B’s, and C’s are generated.  The reaction 
now can only proceed on the borders of those regions.  Thus the reaction rate declines in 
time, whereas it is normally assumed to be a constant in time.  The reaction rate is constant 
only when, at each instant, an invisible hand reaches into the reaction components and well 
mixes all the reactants and products.  The nature of the reaction itself creates spatial 
heterogeneities that change the dynamics of the reaction.

Because the regions around an infected person become depleted with susceptible 

people who have just become infected, the rate of infection will be less than if all of the 
susceptibles in the population were at risk.  Thus b will depend on the size of the 
population N in the patch.  As N increases, the screening effect of the heterogeneity also 
increases.  Thus b, which is a constant in the classical model, is more realistically a function of 
N.  We assume the anzats that 

b = bs N-d

(3)

where bs is a constant, N is the number of people in a patch, and |d|<1.  Such power law 
scalings have been described by Anderson and May [1].  Based on whether an infected 
person always contacts the same number of other people, or a number of people 
proportional to the population size, they proposed that -1 < d < 0 and estimated that -0.07 

page 3

< d < -0.03.  On the other hand, Hethcote et al. [8-11] found that for 5 human diseases d = -
0.05.  Because of the uncertainty in the value of d, for completeness, we will consider both 
the cases for d ≤ 0 and d > 0.  Similarly, we also assume that the birthrate also depends N, 
namely

where µs is a constant and |e|<1. We consider the cases for both e ≤ 0 and e > 0, that is 
when the susceptibles are preferentially added further away from the infected people as 
well as closer to the infected people.

We first determine how the steady state total number of susceptible, Stotal, and 
infected, Itotal, people compare to those that would occur when are all NT are present in one 
homogeneous patch for different distribution of patch sizes.  The steady state solutions, 
dS/dt = dI/dt = 0, to Eqs. (1-2) are S = (g/b) N and I = (µ/g) N .  If the whole population, NT,  
is divided into (NT/N0) patches each of population N0 then,

where Sw and Iw are the total number of susceptible and infected people when the whole 
population is present in one patch.

Many physical, chemical, and biological systems with spatial heterogeneity are well 

characterized by power law distributions in the distribution of the sizes of the spatial 
domains [12-16].  Moreover, the underlying mechanisms that produce the spatial 
heterogeneity in those systems, such as those in diffusion limited chemical reactions, often 
depend on interactions that occur only at the borders of the spatial domains, which here is 
analogous to the spread of infection from infecteds to susceptibles.  Therefore it is 
instructive to consider what happens when the population is partitioned into f(N) patches 
with N people in each patch, where

The total number of people in all the patches, NT is

The total steady state number of susceptible and infected people in a 

heterogeneous set of patches, each with different infectious parameters b and µ, are given 
by Eqs. (5-6) and (9-10).  For example, for a power law distribution of populations, when d 
> 0 and e > 0, the total steady state number of infected and susceptible people is less than 
those that would be present if all the people were in a single, well mixed patch with b and µ 
given by Eqs. (3-4).  The difference from the single, well mixed patch increases as D 
increases in Eq. (7), and reaches plateaus as D approaches ±•.  For a power law 
distribution of populations, when d < 0 and e < 0, then the total steady state number of 
infected and susceptible people is greater than those that would be present if all the 
people were in a single, well mixed patch and this difference increases with increasing D.  
The utility of this approach, based on the scalings of the infectious parameters with 
population size and on the distribution of patch size, is that it makes it possible to 
quantitatively determine how the steady number of susceptible and infected people 
depends on the heterogeneity of the patches.

So far we have modeled the spatial heterogeneity by partitioning the population into 
separate, non-interacting patches.  We now determine how these results are changed when 
there is a migration of susceptible and infected people between the patches.  Here we 
consider the physical movement of infected people from one patch to another, for 
example, such as the relocation of people from one city to another or in refugee camps 
[17].  Note that this flux-based approach differs from models which use a mass action term 
to model the interaction between the patches.  This change in perspective makes it 
possible for us to  show that when susceptible or infected people move from one patch 
into another that there is no change in the steady state total number infected and little change 
in the steady state total number of susceptibles.

We start by considering only one patch with a constant net rate of ps susceptible 

people and pi infected people moving into that patch.  Using the fraction of susceptibles s 
= S/N, and the fraction of infecteds i = I/N, Eqs. (1-2) now become

If there were no movement of susceptible or infected people, then ps = pi = 0, and the

parameters bk and µk in each patch k, where there is no movement of people between the 
patches. The total number of susceptibles and infected is

Hence, the movement of susceptible and infected people from one patch to another patch 
does not change the steady state total number of infected people.  The movement 
changes the number of infected people at the steady state in each patch, but it does not 
change the total, steady state number of infected summed over all the patches.

Thus, when the rate of movement of susceptible or infected people from one patch to 
another is small compared to the birthrate of susceptibles, the steady state total number of 
susceptibles is only moderately different from that total when infected people do not move 
between the patches.

If there are L patches, the movement of susceptible and infected people between 

k = pi

k = ps
k(i1, i2, i3, ... ik).  For the general case, as well as even for the 

the patches will likely depend on the number of susceptible and infected people already in 
each patch.  Thus the generalization of Eqs. (11-12) will have terms such as ps
s2, s3, ... sk) and pi
steady state, where dsk/dt = dik/dt = 0, the equations are nonlinear and there is no simple 
analytical solution for sk and ik.  However, as we now show, these equations can be solved 
for the steady state if we make the assumptions that there is no movement of susceptibles 
and that the rate of movement of infecteds out from a patch is proportional to the number of 
infecteds in that patch.  Therefore, we now use these assumptions to compute the steady 
state solutions analytically and the transient dynamics numerically.  

k(s1, 

We now consider the case of two patches with Sk susceptibles, Ik infected, Nk 

people, contact rate b0k = (bk/Nk) and birthrate µk, where k = 1, 2.  We assume that 
infected people from patch 1 move into patch 2 at a rate of (r1g)I1 and from patch 2 into 
patch 1 at a rate of (r2g)I2.  The parameters rk are the ratios of the rate of decline of the 

page 7

number of infecteds in patch k due to those who leave the patch, r1(gI1), compared to those 
recover from the disease, (gI1).  During a brief time Dt, (r1g)I1Dt infecteds move from patch 1 
into patch 2, and (r2g)I2Dt infecteds move from patch 2 into patch 1, as illustrated in Fig. 1.  
For patch 1, the new number of infecteds after a time Dt is [I1 - (r1g )I1Dt] + (r2g)I2Dt.  Thus, 
the change in S1 and I1 over a brief time Dt are

DS1 = [µ1N1 - b01(1-r1gDt)I1S 1 - b01(r2g)I2S 1Dt] Dt

DI1 = [b01(1-r1gDt)I1S 1 - g(1-r1gDt)I1
+ b01(r2g)I2S 1Dt - g(r2g)I2Dt
- (r1g)I1 + (r2g)I2] Dt

In the limit as Dt approaches 0, the terms of order (Dt)2 <<  (Dt), and Eqs. (22-23) become

The full set of equations for the two patches can now be expressed as

where s1=S1/N1, s2=S2/N2, i1=I1/N1, and i2=I2/N2.  The steady state solutions, dsk/dt = 
dikdt = 0, to Eqs. (26-29) are

It is straightforward to extend these results to models with a larger number of patches.  For 
example, we used Maple (Waterloo Maple Inc. 2003) to compute the analytical solution 
for the steady state for models with three patches.

We studied the dynamical properties of this two patch system by numerical 
integration.  As sk and ik may approach zero, to insure better numerical stability, the 
variables sk and ik were first replaced by the logarithmically transformed variables s'k=ln(sk) 
and i'k=ln(ik) in Eqs. (26-29).  (Note that the variables here can possibly have values that 
represent less than one individual, which could cause the termination of the infection.  We will 
consider these effects due to the disrete nature of the population in future studies.)  The 
equations were then integrated numerically in Matlab using ODE113 with relative tolerance 
10-6 and absolute tolerance 10-12.

We used this two patch model to determine the response of a new population, N2, 

introduced into a region of population, N1, with steady state endemic disease.  We 
simulated the introduction of the new population at time t0 over time scale t by making rk 
time dependent

rk(t) = 0

rk(t) = rk

0[1-e-(t-t0)/t]

t < t0

t > t0

.

(34)

A single, isolated patch has oscillations in the fraction of susceptible and infected people 
about the steady state that define a natural frequency of the patch which can be computed 
from the eigenvalues of Eqs. (1-2).  The period T of this natural frequency is approximately

T ~  2p
bµ

 

(35)

The dynamical behavior of this two patch model depends strongly on the relationship 
between t and T.  We illustrate this with N1 = 106, N2 = 5 x 105, r0
2 = 0, t0 = 10 
yr and the parameters typical of those of measles [6] namely, g = 100 yr-1, µ1 = 0.02 yr-1,  
and b1 = 1200 yr-1.  Based on the scaling assumption of Eqs. (3-4), we chose µ2 = 0.02 
yr-1 and b2 = 1000 yr-1, namely that e = 0, and d = -0.263.  For these parameters, the 
natural period of the patches from Eq. (35) are T1 = 1.3 yr and T2 = 1.4 yr.

1 = 0.1, r0

page 9

For t = 10 yr  >> Tk, the onset time scale of the migration of infected people is much 
longer than the natural time scale of the patches.  In this case the migration does not induce a 
significant epidemic in either population.  This is illustrated in Figure 2a and 2b.  Also shown 
in Figure 2 is the adiabatic, quasi-steady approximation for s1, s2, i1, and i2 as defined by 
evaluating the steady state solutions, Eqs. (30-33), using the time dependent values of 
rk(t) from Eq. (34).

However, for t = 0.1 yr  << Tk, the onset time scale of the migration of infected 
people is much shorter than the natural time scale of the patches.  Now the migration 
induces significant epidemics (local maxima in ik) in both populations.  This is illustrated in 
Figure 3.  Note that the largest epidemic in the newly introduced population is not directly 
driven by the initial flux of infected people into it from the large regional population.  The 
sudden loss of infected people from the larger, regional population eventually drives it far 
from its own steady state, inducing epidemics in its own population.  The flux of infecteds 
into the newly introduced population is proportional to the number of infecteds in the large, 
regional population.  Therefore it is these epidemics in the large regional population that 
now induce epidemics in the newly introduced population.  It is also striking that quite small 
values of rk can drive significant epidemics, when t  << Tk.  The sensitivity of patch 
dynamics to such small coupling parameters between the patches has been noted by Viz, 
Billings, and Schwartz [18] in models where the patches are coupled by mass action terms.  
At long times, sk and ik converge to the same steady state solutions as in Figure 2.

The strength of the largest migration induced epidemic in the newly introduced 
population, as measured by max(i2) from the numerical simulations, is illustrated in Figure 4 
as a function of (t/T1), for r2 = 0 and several values of r1.  When (t/T1) >> 1, the initial local 
maximum in i2 is lower than the new steady state value of i2 reached at long times, and thus 
max(i2) is equal to this new steady state value of i2.  As (t/T1) decreases, the maximum of 
the migration induced epidemics increases and reaches a plateau as (t/T1)  << 1.  The 
plateau occurs because the epidemics in the larger regional population (and the 
subsequent epidemics it induces in the newly introduced population) depend on the natural 
period, T1, of that patch and therefore become insensitive to further decreases in t.  As 
expected, the transition between the new steady state values and the plateau is reached at 
approximately (t/T1)  ~ 1.

We also studied the effects of turning off the migration of infected people between 

the patches.  When the patches were at their steady state values at constant values of 
migration, we reduced the migration to zero over an offset time scale of t.  Similar to results 
we found for the onset of migration, when the offset times scale t  >> Tk there were no 
migration induced epidemics while t  << Tk initiated migration induced epidemics.

An important conclusion from these two patch flux-based studies is that the rate of 

migration of infected people, rk, only moderately alters the steady state fraction of infected 

page 10

people in each patch, as given by Eqs. (32-33), and it alone does not determine if there 
are migration induced epidemics.  It is the onset time scale, t, of this migration that 
determines the existence and severity of epidemics in both populations.  Migration induced 
epidemics occur when the onset time scale is less than the natural time scale T of the 
patches, which is given by Eq. (35).  Moreover, the severity of the migration induced 
epidemics reaches a plateau and does not increase further when the onset time scale is 
further reduced beyond approximately 0.1 that of the natural time scale of the patches.

In order to model more than two patches we extend equations (26-29) to k = 1, 2, ... 

L patches by defining an L x L matrix r, where rkjgIk is the flux of infected from patch k to 
patch j.  The equations, with the logarithmically transformed variables i'k = ln(ik) and s'k = 
ln(sk), are now

We studied several different patterns of migration between the patches including: equal 
migration between all the patches, randomly assigned values for the migration between all 
the patches, equal serial migration (patch 1 <--> 2 <--> 3  ... <--> L), equal unidirectional 
migration (patch 1 --> 2 --> 3  ... --> L), equal ring migration (patch 1 <--> 2 <--> 3  ... <--> L 
<--> 1), as well as uncoupled patches.  We set fixed ratios, Nk/Nk+1, for the populations 
between the patches and used the scaling assumptions of Eqs. (3-4) to choose the values 
of µk and bk in the patches.  We computed the results for models with L ≤ 20.

As the degree of coupling is increased, for example, from equal serial migration to 
equal migration between all the patches, the epidemics in all the patches become more 
synchronous and more coupled to the natural time period of the patch with the largest 
population, even at very low values of r.  This is consistent with results from other studies of 
coupled systems where the coupling strength to produce global synchrony approaches 
zero as the system becomes globally connected [19,20].

Another interesting result from these studies is illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.  In these 

k,k+1 = 0.002 (k = 1, 2, ... 19), the 

simulations 20 patches are serially connected: r0
parameters of the first patch are the same as those in the two patch model, the populations 
of the subsequent patches are Nk/Nk+1 = 2, µk/µk+1 = 1 corresponding to the scaling 
parameter e = 0, t0 = 10 yr, and t = 0.1 yr.  When t << Tk and an epidemic is induced by a 
rapid onset of migration, the patch with the largest population drives epidemics in the other 
patches.  Each patch has its own natural period given by Eq. (35) and so responds at its 
own time scale and therefore reaches its local maximum of the fraction infected at that time 

page 11

scale.  When the natural period of the patches is tuned to increase along the line of patches 
away from the first largest patch, then the patches further from the first, largest patch reach 
their maximum more slowly.  It appears as if a wave of epidemics sweeps away from the 
first, largest patch.  This is illustrated in Figure 5, where bk/bk+1 = 1.1, which corresponds to 
a scaling parameter of d = -0.137.  On the other hand, when the natural period of the 
patches is tuned to decrease along the line of patches away from the first largest patch, then 
the patches further from the first, largest patch reach their maximum faster.  It appears as if a 
wave of epidemics sweeps towards the first, largest patch.  This is illustrated in Figure 6, 
where bk/bk+1 = 0.9, which corresponds to a scaling parameter of d = 0.152.

Traveling waves have been observed, for example, in the spread of dengue 

haemorrhagic fever in Thailand [21].  Such spatial traveling waves of epidemics can be 
generated by spatial transmission through diffusion or stochastic fade-out and reintroduction 
of disease in adjacent patches [2, 21].  However, the apparent wave of epidemics that 
travels along the line of serially connected patches presented here is a different 
phenomena.  These patches form a serial line of (nonlinear) oscillators, each with their own 
time scale given by Eq. (35).  They each reach their maximum response at their individual 
time scale in response to the sudden drive exerted simultaneously in all the patches by the 
rapid onset of the migration.  The apparent wave here arises from the different time delays 
for each individual patch to reach its maximal response.  This contrasts with a true traveling 
wave advancing by spatial transmission through consecutive patches.  We do not argue 
that the phenomena found here is the cause of the observed traveling waves in the 
experimental data.  However, these simulations do demonstrate that such a phenomena is 
possible when there is a variation of infectious parameters b and µ across a region, which 
may reasonably arise from the variation in population densities, social factors, or geographic 
factors across a region.  Therefore, our results do suggest that such a mechanism should at 
least be considered when an apparent traveling wave of epidemics is observed across 
regions with spatial gradients of infectious parameters.

In summary, classical models of the spread of infectious diseases have assumed that 

the infected and susceptible people are either well mixed or that separate patches of 
people interact through a mass action term.  Here, we have derived the equations that 
model the spread of infection driven by the actual migration of people between the 
patches.  We determined the steady state solutions for multiple patches with power law 
scalings of the infectious parameters and compared those results to that of a well-mixed 
population.  We showed, perhaps surprisingly, that the steady state total number of 
infected people is the same whether or not susceptible and infected people move 
between the patches.  Then we studied the dynamical response when the flux of infecteds 
between the patches is turned on at different rates.  This flux-based patch approach is 
useful in modeling the transient response when a new population is moved into a region

with endemic disease.  Epidemics result when the time scale of the onset of this migration is 
rapid compared to the natural time scale of the patches.  These migration induced 
epidemics can take on the appearance of traveling waves across serially connected 
patches.  For example, for the parameters used in the model illustrated in Figure 5, the 
wave travels from the largest patch to the furthest patch in approximately 6 months, of the 
same order as that reported for the traveling wave in the spread of dengue haemorrhagic 
fever in Thailand [21].  Therefore, if there is a spatial gradient of infectious parameters across 
that region, such a mechanism should be considered as one possible explanation for this 
wave.  The results from these models demonstrate the importance of determining the 
spatial distribution of the infectious parameters from experimental data because of the role 
they play in the dynamics of the spread of disease.

Figure 1.  Flux-based model for the migration of infected people between two patches.  

During each brief time Dt, (r1g)I1Dt infected people move from patch 1 into patch 
2, and (r2g)I2Dt infected people move from patch 2 into patch 1. 

Figure 2. Fraction of susceptible (a) and infected (b) people in each of two patches 

computed from the two patch flux-based model.  At t0 = 10 yr infected people 
from the large regional population, N1 = 106, start migrating into the newly 
introduced population N2 = 105, at onset time scale t = 10 yr.  At short times, 
there is no significant epidemic in either patch since the onset time scale of the 
migration is much longer than the natural time scale of the patches.  At long times, 
the migration changes the steady state fraction of susceptible and infected 
people.  Legend: bold black line = large regional population, light black line = 
newly introduced population, dotted lines = adiabatic quasi-steady state 
approximations, boxes = maxima.  (The dotted line for the adiabatic quasi-
steady state approximation is covered by the overlapping bold black line for the 
susceptibles in the large regional population in Figure 2a).

Figure 3. Same two patch flux-based model as Figure 2, except that the onset time scale 
of the migration of infected people, t = 0.1 yr is now much shorter than the natural 
time scale of the patches.  There are now significant epidemics (local maxima in ik) 
in both populations.  Note that the largest epidemics in the newly introduced 
population are driven by the epidemics in the large regional population that were 
triggered by the initial flux of infected people out of this population.  At long 
times, sk and ik converge to the same steady state solutions as in Figure 2.

Figure 4. The strength of the migration induced epidemic in the newly introduced population 
(max i2) is plotted as a function of the ratio of the onset time scale of the migration 
of infected people to the natural frequency, namely, t/T1, for r1 = r and r2 = 0.  As 
t/T1 decreases, the maximum fraction of infected people in the newly introduced 
population increases and reaches a plateau.

Figure 5. Flux based model with 20 patches (k = 1, 2, 3, ... 20) serially connected in a line.  
The ratio of bk/bk+1 = 1.1, so that the natural period increases away from the first, 
largest patch (k = 1) along the line until the last patch (k = 20).  The peaks (boxes) 
of the fraction of infected people in the migration induced epidemic appear to 
travel as a wave away from the first patch.

Figure 6. Flux based model with 20 patches (k = 1, 2, 3, ... 20) serially connected in a line.  
The ratio of bk/bk+1 = 0.9, so that the natural period decreases away from the first, 
largest patch (k = 1) along the line until the last patch (k = 20).  The peaks (boxes) 
of the fraction of infected people in the migration induced epidemic appear to 
travel as a wave towards the first patch.

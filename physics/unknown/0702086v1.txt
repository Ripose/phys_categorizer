Abstract

Based on Maxwellian quaternionic electromagnetic theory, the octonionic hyper-strong field, 
hyper-weak  field  and  the  quantum  interplays  can  be  presented  by  analogy  with  octonionic 
electromagnetic,  gravitational,  strong  and  weak  interactions.  In  the  hyper-weak  field,  the 
study deduces some conclusions of field source particles and intermediate particles which are 
consistent with Dirac equation, Yang-Mills equation, Schrodinger equation and Klein-Gordon 
equation.  It  predicts  some  new  intermediate  particles  and  observed  abnormal  phenomena 
about galaxy clusters which may be caused by the hyper-weak field. In the hyper-strong field, 
the  paper  draws  some  conclusions  of  the  field  source  particles  and  intermediate  particles 
which  are  coincident  with  the  Dirac-like  equation  and  the  second  Dirac-like  equation.  It 
predicts some new intermediate particles, three kinds of colors, and some observed abnormal 
phenomena  which  may  be  caused  by  the  sub-quarks  in  hyper-strong  field.  The  researches 
results show that there may exist the some new field source particles in the hyper-strong and 
hyper-weak fields. 

Keywords: strong interaction; weak interaction; quark; octonion space; quaternion space. 

1. Introduction 

Nowadays,  there  still  exist  some  movement  phenomena  of  galaxy  clusters  which  can’t  be 
explained by current gravitational theory even the hypothesis of dark matter. Therefore, some 
scientists  doubt  the  universality  of  current  gravitational  theory,  and  then  bring  forward  the 
hyper-weak field theory to explain the abnormal phenomena of galaxy clusters etc. 

Meanwhile, the physics of strong interactions is undoubtedly one of the most challenging 
areas of modern science. The strong interactions keep providing new experimental observa- 
tions, which were not predicted by ‘effective’ theories. It retains the problems in describing all 
the observed phenomena simultaneously. And then some scientists bring forward the hyper- 
strong field theory to explain the phenomena of sub-quarks and the associated problem etc.

A new discernment on the problem of hyper-strong and hyper-weak fields can be given by 
the concept of the octonionic space. The octonionic space has been applied to electromagnetic- 
gravitational field and strong-weak field, and would be extended similarly to the hyper-strong 
field and hyper-weak field. All these fields are related to ‘SpaceTime Equality Postulation’. 
The postulation can be explained further as: (1) the spacetime is the extension of fundamental 
interaction characteristics and there is no such spacetime without fundamental interaction, (2) 
each fundamental interaction possesses its own spacetime and all these spacetimes are equi- 
valent, (3) the spacetime of each fundamental interaction is quaternionic space. 

According to the ‘SpaceTime Equality Postulation’, the hyper-strong field and hyper-weak 
field can be described by the octonionic space. By analogy with previous research results of 
electromagnetic-gravitational  field  etc.,  the  paper  describes  the  quantum  properties  of  the 
hyper-strong field, and draws some conclusions and predictions associated with the quantum 
feature of sub-quarks. Its some new and unknown particles and energy can be derived from 
the octonionic hyper-strong field theory. The study develops the quantum theory of the hyper- 
weak field, and draws some conclusions and predictions associated with the quantum charac- 
teristics of the hyper-weak field. Its some new and unknown particles can be used to explain 
the abnormal movement phenomena of galaxy clusters etc. [1-3] 

2. Octonionic electromagnetic-gravitational field 

The  electromagnetic  interaction  theory  can  be  described  with  the  quaternion  algebra.  In  the 
treatise on electromagnetic theory, the quaternion algebra was first used by J. C. Maxwell to 
describe the equations set and various properties of the electromagnetic field. The spacetime, 
which  is  associated  with  electromagnetic  interaction  and  possesses  of  physics  content,  is 
adopted  by  the  quaternionic  space.  According  to  the  ‘SpaceTime  Equality  Postulation’,  the 
gravitational interaction can be described by the quaternion likewise. 

The  electromagnetic  and  gravitational  interactions  are  interconnected,  unified  and  equal. 
Both of them can be described in the quaternionic space. By means of the conception of the 
space expansion etc., two types of quaternionic spaces can combine into an octonionic space 
(Octonionic space E-G, for short). In the octonionic space, various characteristics of electro- 
magnetic and gravitational interactions can be described uniformly, and some equations set of 
the electromagnetic-gravitational field can be attained. 

2.1 Equations set of electromagnetic-gravitational field 

There exist four types of subfields and their field sources in the electromagnetic-gravitational 
field.  In  Table  1,  the  electromagnetic-electromagnetic  subfield  is  ‘extended  electromagnetic 
field’,  and  its  general  charge  is  E  electric-charge.  The  gravitational-gravitational  subfield  is 
‘modified  gravitational  filed’,  and  its  general  charge  is  G  gravitational-charge.  Meanwhile, 
electromagnetic-gravitational and gravitational-electromagnetic subfields are both long range 
fields and candidates of the ‘dark matter field’. And their general charges (G electric-charge 
and E gravitational-charge) are candidates of ‘dark matter’. The physical features of the dark

The  particles  of  the  ordinary  matter  (electron  etc.)  possess  the  E  charge  together  with  G 
gravitational-charge.  The  particles  of  dark  matter  may  possess  the  G  electric-charge  with  E 
gravitational-charge, or G gravitational-charge with G electric-charge, etc. It can be predicted 
that field strengths of electromagnetic-gravitational subfield and gravitational-electromagnetic 
subfield must be very weak and slightly less than that of gravitational-gravitational subfield, 
otherwise they should be detected for a long time. Where, k = k E-G = c is the constant. 

The  electromagnetic-electromagnetic  subfield  is  the extended  electromagnetic  interaction. 
The variation of field energy density has direct effect on the force of charge and current. As 
shown in Aharonov-Bohm experiment, field potentials have effects on the potential energy etc. 
And the change of field potential can impact the movement of field sources.

The gravitational-gravitational subfield is the modified gravitational field, which includes 
familiar  Newtonian  gravitational  field.  The  modified  gravitational  field  has  the  following 
prediction. The planetary orbits possess the near coplanarity, near circularity and corevolving, 
and the planets own rotation property. The centrifugal force of celestial body will change and 
lead to fluctuation of revolution speed, when the field energy density or angular momentum

of celestial body along the sense of revolution varied. 

The electromagnetic-gravitational and gravitational-electromagnetic subfields are both long 
range  fields  and  candidates  of  dark  matter  field.  The  field  strength  of  the  electromagnetic- 
gravitational and gravitational-electromagnetic subfields may be equal and slightly less than 
that of gravitational-gravitational subfield. The dark matter field has the following prediction. 
Two  types  of  field  sources  possessed  by  the  dark  matter  field  would  make  the  dark  matter 
particles diversiform. The research results explain that some observed abnormal phenomena 
about celestial bodies are caused by either modified gravitational interaction or dark matter. 

2.2 Quantum equations set of electromagnetic-gravitational field 

In the octonionic space E-G, the wave functions of the quantum mechanics are the octonionic 
equations  set.  And  the  Dirac  and  Klein-Gordon  equations  of  the  quantum  mechanics  are 
actually the wave equations set which are associated with particles’ wave function (cid:60). Where, 
the wave function (cid:60) = M(cid:18) (cid:33) E-G can be written as the exponential form with the octonionic 
characteristics. The coefficient h is Planck constant, and  (cid:33) = (cid:33) E-G = h/2(cid:83) . 

By comparison, we find that the Dirac equation and Klein-Gordon equation can be attained 
respectively from the energy equation and power quantum equation after substituting operator 
c (B/c +(cid:442)) for {W(cid:18)(c (cid:33) E-G) +(cid:442)}. By analogy with the above equations, the Dirac-like and 
the  second  Dirac-like  equations  can  be  procured  from  the  field  source  and  force  quantum 
equations respectively. Wherein, B(cid:18) (cid:33) E-G is the wave function also. 

Table 3.    Quantum equations set of electromagnetic-gravitational field 

Energy quantum 
Power quantum 
Field source quantum 
Force quantum 

U = (W(cid:18)c (cid:33) E-G +(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) M
L = (W(cid:18)c (cid:33) E-G +(cid:442)) (cid:405) U
T = (W(cid:18)c (cid:33) E-G +(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) B
O = (W(cid:18)c (cid:33) E-G +(cid:442)) (cid:405) T

In  the  electromagnetic-gravitational  field,  when  the  energy  quantum  equation  U  =  0,  the 
Dirac and Schrodinger equations can be deduced to describe the field source particle with the 
spin 1/2 (electron etc.). When the power quantum equation L = 0, the Klein-Gordon equation 
can be attained to explain the field source particle with spin 0. When the field source quantum 
equation T = 0, the Dirac-like equation can be deduced to describe the intermediate particle 
with  spin  1  (photon  etc.).  When  the  force  quantum  equation  O  =  0,  the  second  Dirac-like 
equation can be attained to explain the intermediate particle with the spin N. Those equations 
can conclude the results which are consistent with the quantum property of electromagnetic- 
electromagnetic subfield in certain cases. 

3. Octonionic strong-weak field 

There is an analogy between the octonionic spacetime of the strong-weak field and that of the 

 

4

electromagnetic-gravitational  field.  According  to  the  ‘SpaceTime  Equality  Postulation’,  the 
spacetime,  which  is  associated  with  the  strong  interaction  and  possesses  of  the  physics 
content,  is  adopted  by  the  quaternionic  space.  And  the  spacetime  derived  from  the  weak 
interaction is supposed to be the quaternionic space also. 

The strong and weak interactions are interconnected, unified and equal. Both of them can 
be  described  in  the  quaternionic  space.  By  means  of  the  conception  of  the  space  expansion 
etc., two types of the quaternionic spaces can combine into an octonionic space (Octonionic 
space S-W, for short). In the octonionic space, various characteristics of the strong and weak 
interactions can be described uniformly, and some equations set of the strong-weak field can 
be obtained. 

3.1 Equations set of strong-weak field 

In strong-weak field, there exist four types of subfields and their field sources. The subfields 
of strong-weak field are short range. In Table 4, the strong-strong subfield may be ‘extended 
strong field’, its general charge is S strong-charge. The weak-weak subfield may be regarded 
as the ‘modified weak field’, and its general charge is W weak-charge. And the strong-weak 
and  weak-strong  subfields  may  be  regarded  as  two  kinds  of  new  and  unknown  subfields. 
Their general charges are W strong-charge and S weak-charge respectively.   

It can be predicted that the field strength of the strong-weak and weak-strong subfields may 
be equal and weaker than that of weak-weak subfield. Sometimes, the first two subfields may 
be  regarded  as  ‘familiar  weak  field’  mistakenly.  Therefore  three  kinds  of  colors  have  to 
introduce into the familiar weak interaction theory to distinguish above three types of weaker 
subfields of the strong-weak field. The physical features of subfields of the strong-weak field 
meet the requirement of Table 5.

In the strong-weak field, the definition of the field strength is very different from that of the 
electromagnetic-gravitational field, and thus the succeeding equations and operators should be 
revised.  By  analogy  with  the  case  of  the  electromagnetic-gravitational  field,  the  octonionic 
differential operator  (cid:3340)(cid:3)in the strong-weak field needs to be generalized to the new operator 

5

(A/k +(cid:442)). That is because of the field potential is much more fundamental than field strength, 
and the strong-weak field belongs to the short range. Therefore the physical characteristics of 
the strong-weak field can be researched from many aspects. Where, k = k S-W is the constant.

3.2 Quantum equations set of strong-weak field 

In the octonionic space S-W, the wave functions of the quantum mechanics are the octonionic 
equations  set.  And  the  Dirac  and  Klein-Gordon  equations  of  the  quantum  mechanics  are 
actually the wave equations set which are associated with particles’ wave function (cid:60). Where, 
the wave function (cid:60) = M(cid:18) (cid:33) S-W can be written as the exponential form with the octonionic 
characteristics. The coefficient b is the Plank-like constant. 

By comparison, we find that Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations in strong-weak field can be 
attained respectively from energy equation and power equation after substituting the operator 
k (A/k +(cid:442)) for (W/k (cid:33) S-W +(cid:442)). In the strong-weak field, when the energy quantum equation 
U  =  0,  the  Dirac  and  Schrodinger  equations  can  be  deduced  to  describe  the  field  source 
particle with spin 1/2 (quark and lepton etc.). When the power quantum equation L = 0, the 
Klein-Gordon equation can be obtained to explain the field source particle with spin 0. 

Table 6.    Quantum equations set of strong-weak field

U = (W(cid:18)k (cid:33) S-W +(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) M
L = (W(cid:18)k (cid:33) S-W +(cid:442)) (cid:405) U
T = (W(cid:18)k (cid:33) S-W +(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) B
O = (W(cid:18)k (cid:33) S-W +(cid:442)) (cid:405) T

By  analogy  with  the  above  equations,  the  Dirac-like  and  the  second  Dirac-like  equations 
can be concluded from the field source equation and the force equation respectively. Wherein, 
B /b is the wave function also. In strong-weak field, when the field source quantum equation 
T = 0, the Dirac-like equation can be deduced to describe the intermediate particle with spin 1 
(intermediate  bosons  etc.).  When  the  force  quantum  equation  O  =  0,  the  second  Dirac-like 
equation in strong-weak field can be attained to explain the intermediate particle with spin N.

3.3 Compounding particles 

In strong-weak field, the intermediate and field source particles can be tabled as following. In 
Table 7, we can find the intermediate boson, lepton, three colors of quarks, and other kinds of 
new and unknown particles which may be existed in the nature and expressed in parentheses.

In  the  electromagnetic-gravitational  field,  the  field  sources  and  intermediate  particles  can 
be tabled as following. In the Table 8, we shall find the photon, electron, and other kinds of 
unknown particles which may be existed in the nature. Specially, by analogy with above three 
colors of quarks in Table 7, it can be predicted that there may are the ‘green electron’ and ‘red 
electron’ in the nature, if the familiar electron is denoted as the ‘blue’ electron. Some particles 
may  possess  more  than  two  sorts  of  general  charges.  If  the  quarks  possess  the  S  strong- 
charge,  W  weak-charge,  E  electric-charge  and  G  gravitational-charge,  they  will  take  part  in 
strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational interactions.

In strong-strong subfield, we can deduce Yang-Mills equation, Dirac equation, Schrodinger 
equation and Klein-Gordon equation of quarks and leptons. And it is able to infer Dirac-like 
and the second Dirac-like equations of intermediate particles among the leptons or quarks etc.

It  may  predict  that  there  are  some  new  energy  parts  and  new  unknown  particles  of  quarks, 
leptons and intermediate particles in the subfields. 

In the strong-weak field, we can explain why quarks possess three sorts of colors and take 
part  in  four  kinds  of  interactions.  There  exist  two  new  kinds  of  subfields  (weak-strong 
subfield, strong-weak subfield), which field strengths may be equivalent to that of the weak- 
weak  subfield.  Sometimes,  we  mix  up  them  with  the  weak-weak  subfield  mistakenly.  So  it 
needs three sorts of ‘colors’ to distinguish those ‘mixed’ subfields in the quark theory. 

4. Hypothetic fields 

Based  on  electromagnetic-gravitational  field  and strong-weak  field,  it  can  be  presumed  that 
there  exist  two  new  kinds  of  unknown  fields  at  least  theoretically.  One  is  the  hyper-strong 
field, and the other is the hyper-weak field. The first one is much stronger and shorter than the 
strong-strong  subfield,  and  the  last  one  is  much  weaker  and  longer  than  the  gravitational- 
gravitational subfield. 

In comparisons with the following field property, we present the theory of hyper-strong and 
hyper-weak fields. In the gravitational-gravitational field, the item (B *(cid:3)
(cid:405) B ) of field source 
definition  possesses  the  field  strength.  In  the  strong-weak  field,  the  item  (A (cid:405) A  )  of  field 
strength definition possesses the field potential. It is easy to find that field potential is more 
fundamental than the field strength. So we may speculate on that there exist one kind of much 
stronger  and  shorter  field  (hyper-strong  field)  with  the  item  (X *(cid:3)
(cid:405) X  )  of  field  potential 
definition, for the physical quantity X is more fundamental than the field potential. And there 
exist one kind of much weaker and longer field (hyper-weak field) with the item (S (cid:405) S ) of the 
force definition, for the field source S is not as fundamental as the field strength B .

By analogy with the electromagnetic-gravitational field and strong-weak field, the physical 
quantity  and equations  set  of  the  hyper-strong  and  hyper-weak  fields  can  be  deduced  in  the 
Table 9. The spacetimes, equations and operators of the last two fields are different to that of 
the first two fields. 

5. Octonionic hyper-strong field 

There is an analogy between the octonionic spacetime of the hyper-strong field and that of the 
electromagnetic-gravitational  field.  According  to  the  ‘SpaceTime  Equality  Postulation’,  the 
spacetime, which is associated with the hyper-strong field and possesses of physics content, is 
adopted  by  the  octonionic  space  (Octonionic  space  H-S,  for  short).  In  the  octonionic  space 
H-S,  various  characteristics  of  the  hyper-strong  field  can  be  described  uniformly  and  some 
equations set of the hyper-strong field can be obtained. 

In the octonionic space H-S, the base E can be written as

5.1 Equations set of hyper-strong field 

The  hyper-strong  field  may  consist  of  A  and  B  interactions.  In  the  hyper-strong  field,  there 
exist four types of subfields (A-A subfield, A-B subfield, B-A subfield and B-B subfield) and 
their field sources (A A-charge, A B-charge, B A-charge, B B-charge). The subfields of the 
hyper-strong field are hyper-short range in Table 11. 

(cid:3)

Table 11.    Subfield types of hyper-strong field 

 

A Interaction 

B Interaction 

A quaternionic 
space

B quaternionic 
space

A-A subfield 
A A-charge 
intermediate particle (cid:74)AA

A-B subfield 
B A-charge 
intermediate particle (cid:74)AB

B-A subfield 
A B-charge 
intermediate particle (cid:74)BA

B-B subfield 
B B-charge 
intermediate particle (cid:74)BB

It can be predicted that the field strength of the A-A subfield is stronger than other three 
subfields,  and  the  field  strength  of  the  B-A  subfield  and  A-B  subfield  may  be  equal  and 
weaker than that of B-B subfield. The physical features of each subfield in the hyper-strong 
field meet the requirement of equations in the Table 12. 

In  the  hyper-strong  field,  the  definition  of  the  field  potential  is  very  different  to  that  of 
other  fields  (electromagnetic-gravitational  or  strong-weak  fields),  and  thus  the  succeeding 
equations  and  operators  should  be  revised.  By  analogy  with  the  case  of  other  fields,  the 
octonionic  differential  operator  (cid:3340)(cid:3)in  the  hyper-strong  field  needs  to  be  generalized  to  the 
new  operator  (X/k  +(cid:442)).  That  is  because  of  the  physical  quantity  X  is  much  more  funda- 

 

10

mental  than  the  field  potential,  and  the  hyper-strong  field  belongs  to  the  hyper-short  range. 
Therefore the physical characteristics of the hyper-strong field can be researched from many 
aspects. Where, k = c = k H-S is the constant. 

The field strength B of the hyper-strong field can be defined as 

B = (X/k +(cid:442)) (cid:405) A                                                          (6)

then the field source and the force of the hyper-strong field can be defined respectively as 

(cid:80)S = (X/k +(cid:442)) *(cid:3)(cid:405) B                                                        (7) 
Z = k (X/k +(cid:442)) (cid:405) S                                                     (8) 
where, the mark (*) denotes octonionic conjugate. The coefficient (cid:80) is interaction intensity of 
the hyper-strong field. 

The angular momentum of the hyper-strong field can be defined as (krx is the coefficient) 

M = S (cid:405) (R + krx X)                                                          (9) 

and the energy and power in the hyper-strong field can be defined respectively as 

W = k (X/k +(cid:442)) *(cid:3)(cid:405) M                                                        (10) 
N = k (X/k +(cid:442)) (cid:405) W                                                          (11) 
The above equations show that, the angular momentum M , energy W and power(cid:3)N of the 
hyper-strong field are different to that of other fields. The physical quantity X has effect on 
the field potential A , the angular momentum S (cid:405) X , the energy X * (cid:405) (S (cid:405) X) and the power 
(X (cid:405) X * ) (cid:405) (S (cid:405) X ).

In the above equations, as a part of field potential A, the item (X* (cid:405) X/k) has an important 
impact on the subsequent equations. In the hyper-strong field, the force-balance equation can 
be obtained when Z = 0, the conservation of angular momentum can be gained when(cid:3)W = 0, 
and the energy conservation of can be attained when N = 0.

5.2 Quantum equations set of hyper-strong field 

In the octonionic space H-S, the wave functions of the quantum mechanics are the octonionic 
equations  set.  And  the  Dirac  and  Klein-Gordon  equations  of  the  quantum  mechanics  are 
actually the wave equations set which are associated with particle’s wave function (cid:60) = M/b.
Wherein, the wave function (cid:60) = S (cid:405) (R + krx X)/b can be written as the exponential form with 
the octonionic characteristics. The coefficient b = (cid:33) H-S is the Plank-like constant. 

 

11

5.2.1 Equations set of Dirac and Klein-Gordon 
By comparison, we find that the Dirac equation and Klein-Gordon equation can be attained 
respectively  from  the  energy  equation  (10)  and  power  equation  (11)  after  substituting  the 
operator k (X/k +(cid:442)) for (W/kb +(cid:442)).

The U equation of the quantum mechanics can be defined as 

U = (W/k + b(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) (M / b)                                                  (12) 

The L equation of the quantum mechanics can be defined as 

L = (W/k + b(cid:442))(cid:3)(cid:405) (U / b)                                                    (13) 
In hyper-strong field, when the energy quantum equation U = 0, the Dirac and Schrodinger 
equations can be deduced to describe the field source particle with spin 1/2. When the power 
quantum equation L = 0, Klein-Gordon equation can be obtained to explain the field source 
particle with spin 0. [4-6] 

5.2.2 Equations set of Dirac-like 
By analogy with the above equations, the Dirac-like and the second Dirac-like equations can 
be procured from the field source equation (7) and force equation (8) respectively. Wherein, 
B /b is the wave function also. 

The T equation of the quantum mechanics can be defined as 

T = (W/k + b(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) (B / b)                                                  (14) 

The O equation of the quantum mechanics can be defined as 

O = (W/k + b(cid:442))(cid:3)(cid:405) (T / b)                                                    (15) 
In hyper-strong field, when the field source quantum equation T = 0, Dirac-like equation 
can  be  deduced  to  describe  the  intermediate  particle  with  spin  1.  When  the  force  quantum 
equation O  =  0,  the  second  Dirac-like  equation  in  the  hyper-strong  field  can  be  attained  to 
explain the intermediate particle with spin N.

U = (W/k + b(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) (M /b)

T = (W/k + b(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) (B /b)
O = (W/k + b(cid:442)) (cid:405) (T /b)

5.3 Compounding particles 

In hyper-strong field, the intermediate and field source particles can be tabled as following. In 
Table 14, we can find the intermediate particles and other kinds of new and unknown particles 
which may be existed in the nature and expressed in parentheses.   

Some  particles  may  possess  more  than  two  sorts  of  general  charges.  If  the  field  source 
particles  possess  S  strong-charge,  W  weak-charge,  E  electric-charge,  G  gravitational-charge 
and general charges of hyper-strong field, they will take part in the strong interaction, weak 
interaction, electromagnetic interaction, gravitational interaction and hyper-strong field etc.

6. Octonionic hyper-weak field 

There is an analogy between the octonionic spacetime of the hyper-weak field and that of the 
hyper-weak field. According to the ‘SpaceTime Equality Postulation’, the spacetime, which is 
associated  with  the  hyper-weak  field  and  possesses  of  physics  content,  is  adopted  by  the 
octonionic  space  (Octonionic  space  H-W,  for  short).  In  the  octonionic  space  H-W,  various 
characteristics of the hyper-weak field can be described uniformly, and some equations set of 
the hyper-weak field can be obtained. 

In the octonionic space H-W, the base E can be written as

The octonionic differential operator  (cid:3340)  and its conjugate operator  (cid:3340)* are defined as, 

(cid:3340)(cid:3)= (cid:3340)  hw(cid:3)+(cid:3)(cid:3340)  HW(cid:3)    ,      (cid:3340)*(cid:3)= (cid:3340)*

6.1 Equations set of hyper-weak field 

The  hyper-weak  field  may  be  consisting  of  C  and  D  interactions.  In  the  hyper-weak  field, 
there exist four types of subfields (C-C subfield, C-D subfield, D-C subfield and D-D subfield) 
and their field sources (C C-charge, C D-charge, D C-charge, D D-charge). The subfields of 
the hyper-weak field are hyper-long range in Table 15.

D-C subfield 
C D-charge 
intermediate particle (cid:74)DC

D-D subfield 
D D-charge

It can be predicted that the field strength of the C-C subfield is stronger than the subsequent 
equations,  and  the  field  strength  of  the  D-C  subfield  and  C-D  subfield  may  be  equal  and 
weaker than that of D-D subfield. The physical features of each subfield of the hyper-weak 
field meet the requirement of Table 16. 

In the hyper-weak field, the definition of the force is very different to that of other fields 
(hyper-strong,  strong-weak  or  electromagnetic-gravitational  fields),  and  thus  the  succeeding 
equations  and  operators  should  be  revised.  By  analogy  with  the  case  of  other  fields,  the 
octonionic differential operator  (cid:3340)(cid:3)in the hyper-weak field needs to be generalized to the new 
operator  (S/k  +(cid:442)).  That  is  because  of  the  field  source  is  not  as  fundamental  as  the  field 
potential  or  field  strength,  and  the  hyper-weak  field  belongs  to hyper-long  range.  Therefore 
the physical characteristics of hyper-weak field can be studied from many aspects. Where, the 
coefficient k = c = k H-W is the constant. 

The field strength B of the hyper-weak field can be defined as 

B = (cid:442) (cid:405) A                                                                (20)

then the field source and the force of the hyper-weak field can be defined respectively as 

(cid:80)S = (cid:442)*(cid:3)(cid:405) B                                                                (21) 
Z = k (S/k +(cid:442)) (cid:405) S                                                   (22) 
where, the mark (*) denotes octonionic conjugate. The coefficient (cid:80) is interaction intensity of 
the hyper-weak field. 

The angular momentum of the hyper-weak field can be defined as (krx is the coefficient) 

M = S (cid:405) (R + krx X)                                                          (23) 

and the energy and power in the hyper-weak field can be defined respectively as 

W = k (S/k +(cid:442)) *(cid:3)(cid:405) M                                                        (24) 
N = k (S/k +(cid:442)) (cid:405) W                                                          (25) 
The above equations show that, the angular momentum M , energy W and power(cid:3)N of the 
hyper-strong field are different to that of other fields. The physical quantity X has effect on 
the field potential A , the angular momentum S (cid:405) X , the energy S * (cid:405) (S (cid:405) X) and the power 
(S (cid:405) S * ) (cid:405) (S (cid:405) X ).

In the above equations, as a part of force Z, the item (S (cid:405) S/k) has an important impact on

the  subsequent  equations.  In  hyper-weak  field,  the  force-balance  equation  can  be  obtained 
when Z  =  0,  the  conservation  of  angular  momentum  can  be  gained  when(cid:3)W  =  0,  and  the 
energy conservation can be attained when N = 0.

6.2 Quantum equations set of hyper-weak field 

In the octonionic space H-W, the wave functions of the quantum mechanics are the octonionic 
equations  set.  And  the  Dirac  and  Klein-Gordon  equations  of  the  quantum  mechanics  are 
actually the wave equations set which are associated with particle’s wave function (cid:60) = M/b.
Wherein, the wave function (cid:60) = S (cid:405) (R + krx X)/b can be written as the exponential form with 
the octonionic characteristics. The coefficient b = (cid:33) H-W is the Plank-like constant. 

6.2.1 Equations set of Dirac and Klein-Gordon 
By comparison, we find that the Dirac equation and Klein-Gordon equation can be attained 
respectively  from  the  energy  equation  (24)  and  power  equation  (25)  after  substituting  the 
operator k (S/k +(cid:442)) for (W/kb +(cid:442)).

The U equation and L equation of the quantum mechanics can be defined respectively as 

U = (W/k + b(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) (M / b)                                                  (26) 
L = (W/k + b(cid:442))(cid:3)(cid:405) (U / b)                                                    (27) 
In the hyper-weak field, when the energy quantum equation U = 0, Dirac and Schrodinger 
equations can be deduced to describe the field source particle with spin 1/2. When the power 
quantum  equation  L  =  0,  the  Klein-Gordon  equation  can  be  obtained  to  explain  the  field 
source particle with spin 0. 

6.2.2 Equations set of Dirac-like 
By analogy with the above equations, Dirac-like equation and the second Dirac-like equation 
can  be  drawn  from  the  field  source  equation  (21)  and  the  force  equation  (22)  respectively. 
Wherein, B /b is the wave function also. 

The T equation and O equation of the quantum mechanics can be defined respectively as 

                                          T = (b(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) (B / b)                                                            (28) 
                                          O = (W/k + b(cid:442))(cid:3)(cid:405) (T / b)                                                      (29)

In the hyper-weak field, when the field source quantum equation T = 0, Dirac-like equation 
in the hyper-weak field can be deduced to describe the intermediate particle with the spin 1. 
When the force quantum equation  O = 0, the second Dirac-like equation in the hyper-weak 
field can be attained to explain the intermediate particle with the spin N.

T = (b(cid:442))*(cid:3)(cid:405) (B /b)
O = (W/k + b(cid:442)) (cid:405) (T /b)

6.3 Compounding particles 

In hyper-weak field, the intermediate and field source particles can be tabled as following. In 
Table 18, we can find the intermediate particles and other kinds of new and unknown particles 
which may be existed in the nature and expressed in parentheses. Some particles may possess 
more than two sorts of general charges. If the field source particles possess S strong-charge, 
W  weak-charge,  E  electric-charge,  G  gravitational-charge,  general  charges  of  hyper-strong 
and hyper-weak fields, they will take part in the strong interaction, weak interaction, electro- 
magnetic interaction, gravitational interaction, hyper-strong and hyper-weak fields etc. [7-9]

7. Conclusions 

By  analogy  with  the  octonionic  electromagnetic-gravitational  and  strong-weak  fields,  the 
octonionic  hyper-strong  and  hyper-weak  fields  have  been  developed,  including  their  field 
equations, quantum equations and some new unknown particles. 

In  hyper-strong  field,  the study  deduces  Dirac  equation,  Schrodinger  equation and  Klein- 
Gordon equation of sub-quarks. And it is able to infer the Dirac-like and the second Dirac-like 
equations  of  intermediate  particles  among  sub-quarks.  It  predicts  that  there  may  exist  some

new energy parts of hyper-strong field, new intermediate particles among the sub-quarks, and 
unknown particles which are associated with the sub-quark. 

In  the  hyper-weak  field,  the  research  achieves  the  Yang-Mills  equation,  Dirac  equation, 
Schrodinger equation and Klein-Gordon equation of the general charges in hyper-weak field. 
And it is able to conclude the Dirac-like and the second Dirac-like equation of intermediate 
bosons among the general charges of hyper-weak field. It predicts that there exist new energy 
components, some new unknown field source particles and the intermediate particles among 
general charges of the hyper-weak fielding in the galaxy clusters.

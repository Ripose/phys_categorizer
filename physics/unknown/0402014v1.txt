In this paper we present a modification of the geometrical optics method, which allows one 

to  properly  separate  the  complex  amplitude  and  the  phase  of  the  wave  solution.  Appling 

this modification to a smoothly inhomogeneous isotropic medium, we show that in the first 

geometrical optics approximation the medium is weakly anisotropic. The refractive index, 

being  dependent  on  the  direction  of  the  wave  vector,  contains  the  correction,  which  is 

proportional to the Berry geometric phase. Two independent eigenmodes of right-hand and 

left-hand  circular  polarizations  exist  in  the  medium.  Their  group  velocities  and  phase 

velocities  differ.  The  difference  in  the  group  velocities  results  in  the  shift  of  the  rays  of 

different  polarizations  (the  optical  Magnus  effect).  The difference in  the phase velocities 

causes the increase of Berry phase along with the interference of two modes leading to the 

familiar  Rytov  law  about  the  rotation  of  the  polarization  plane  of  a  wave.  The  theory 

developed  suggests  that  both  the  optical  Magnus  effect  and  the  Berry  phase  are 

accompanying  nonlocal  topological  effects.  In  this  paper  the  Hamilton  ray  equations 

giving  a  unified  description  for  both  of  these  phenomena  have  been  derived  and  also  a

1. INTRODUCTION 

The first consistent presentation of the geometrical optics approximation, as applied to the 

electromagnetic  wave  propagation  through  a  smoothly  inhomogeneous  isotropic  medium,  was 

given  by  Rytov  in  [1].  There  was  indicated  that  in  the  zero  geometrical  optics  approximation, 

only  the  phase  and  the  amplitude  of  a  transverse  wave  can  be  determined,  but  not  the 

polarization.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  two  modes  with  distinct  polarizations  turn  out  to  be 

degenerate  or  indistinguishable.  The  polarization  degeneracy  can  be  removed  through  a 

consideration of the first-order terms in the geometrical optics approximation. Hence the familiar 

Rytov  law  about  rotation  of  the  polarization  plane  of  an  electromagnetic  wave  in  a  smoothly 

inhomogeneous medium follows [1−3]. The geometrical properties of this law were detailed by 

Vladimirsky in [2]. Subsequently, it was shown that the Rytov law is nothing but a consequence 

of the appearance of the Berry geometric phases of photons (see [4−6]). 

The anisotropic medium differs from the isotropic one in that (in the general case) it has no 

polarization degeneracy and thus the polarization of electromagnetic waves is determined even 

in zero geometrical optics approximation [3]. In this regard, the account of the first geometrical 

optics  approximation  in  an  isotropic  medium  is  similar  to  the  case  of  a  weakly  anisotropic 

medium. Provided this analogy has good grounds, what this means is the smooth inhomogeneity 

causes a real weak anisotropy of the medium. In this case, the assumed anisotropy will result in 

the  propagation  of  the  eigenmodes  (waves  of  right-hand  and  left-hand  polarizations)  along 

different trajectories.

The  changes  of  ray  trajectories  with  polarization  correspond  to  the  so-called  optical 

Magnus  effect,  which  was  suggested  in  1990  by  Zel’dovich  and  coauthors  [7].  The  optical 

Magnus  effect  was  calculated  theoretically  and  supported  experimentally  for  waves  in  optical 

fibers.  After  that  the  phenomenological  theory  describing  this  phenomenon  in  the  geometrical 

optics  approximation  was  advanced  in  [8].  The  results  of  the  present  work  support  and 

generalize  the  corrections  introduced  by  Liberman  and  Zel’dovich  and  demonstrate  that  the 

relevant equations and effects follow from the initial principles of geometrical optics. 

Below  is  shown  that  in  the  first  (Rytov)  geometrical  optics  approximation,  an  isotropic 

smoothly inhomogeneous medium is actually anisotropic. What this means is: 1) the refractive 

index  of  this  medium  depends  on  the  wave-vector  direction;  2)  the  medium  contains  two 

independent transverse modes with right-hand and left-hand polarizations, their group velocities 

and phase velocities are distinct; 3) as a consequence of the anisotropy, the right-hand polarized 

and left-hand polarized modes propagate along different ray trajectories. 

In  that  way  a  ray  of  the  wave  with  mixed  (not  circular)  polarization  is  split  into  two 

independent rays with right-hand and left-hand polarizations. This fact makes a prediction about 

a  novel  phenomenon,  which  is  not  covered  by  the  theory  of  the  optical  Magnus  effect  [7,8]. 

Really, Zel’dovich theory describes the displacement of the ray’s center of gravity depending on 

its  polarization,  but  does  not  point  to  a  possible  ray  splitting.  Our  theory  suggests  that  only 

circular polarized independent rays exist in the framework of the approximation considered. The 

rays  of  other  polarizations  arise  from  the  interference  of  the  eigenmodes  that  propagate  along 

different trajectories. 

In fact, the theory developed establishes a link between two fundamental phenomena – the 

Berry geometrical phase and the optical Magnus effect. It is shown in the paper that the former 

implies the difference of phase velocities of the eigenmodes, whereas the latter is caused by the 

difference  of  group  velocities.  We  demonstrate  that  the  optical  Magnus  effect,  as  well  as  the 

 

3

Berry phase, is a nonlocal topological effect described by the geometry of the system’s trajectory 

in a momentum space. 

The results mentioned follow immediately from the initial principles of geometrical optics. 

The  reason  why  these  phenomena  have  not  been  theoretically  revealed  before  is  that  in  the 

conventional geometrical optics (see, for example, [3]) the separation of the complex amplitude 

and the complex phase was performed not quite correctly. As a result, the terms of the first order, 

which cause the above-mentioned effects, have been disregarded in the wave eikonal. Below the 

modified  geometrical  optics  theory  is  presented,  which  is  free  of  the  drawbacks  outlined. 

Specific examples are also analyzed (Section 4).

However, in general, this is not the case. Actually, the adiabatic (or WKB, or geometrical

are  the  matrix  operators  since  the  field  is  a  vector  changing  its  direction.  Some  of  the  terms 

comprising complex phase of Eq. (3) can be taken out and inserted into the pre-exponent factor 

(amplitude). It is obvious that the separation of these terms into the phase and the amplitude is a 

matter  of  convention  (in  so  far  as  the  amplitude  is  a  complex  value).  Hence,  it  is  primarily 

important to define a criterion, according to which we can separate these terms. 

In  the  conventional  geometrical  optics  [3]  the  phase  ψ  and  the  eikonal  equation 

correspond to zero order approximation in (3):

In  this  equation, 

  is  now  the  operator  with  different  eigenvalues,  which  determines  the 

( 1ˆΨ

)

Rytov  evolution  of  wave  polarization.  Thus,  in  the  framework  of  conventional  geometrical 

optics, the phase and the amplitude are separated according to their orders, for which, actually, 

there are no grounds. 

                                                 
1) We assume that the operator in the exponent in (3) can be put in a diagonal form, corresponding to a basis 

of  normal  independent  modes.  Hence,  by  reason  of  asymptotic  nature  of  the  series,  all  operators  under  the 

summation sign will be diagonal in this basis. By this is meant that these operators commute, since from here on we 

shall be able to represent the exponent of their sum as a product of the exponents. 

 

5

We  suggest  another  way.  Note  that  the  phase  is  a  nonlocal  or  integral  value,  since  its 

increment is determined by the entire path covered by the wave. To the contrary, the amplitude 

in a passive nonabsorbing medium with independent eigenmodes is conceptually a local value, 

being dependent only on the initial conditions and the current values of parameters. Indeed, the 

amplitude specifies the wave energy, whose variation is bound to be governed by the initial and 

final points only, and not by the transfer path.2) In the case of an absorbing or active medium, the 

amplitude is no longer a local value. Then, the local amplitude should be multiplied by the part 

of nonlocal exponential function with a real exponent. 

Thus the procedure for separating the phase and the amplitude is as follows. In Eq. (3) we 

separate local and nonlocal terms: 

Then, the amplitude and the phase can be separated in the following manner:

from Maxwell’s equations and can be given as [1,6]

to  the  refractive  indices.  Here  and  further  the  medium  smoothness  implies  the  short-wave

In  the  conventional  geometrical  optics  [1,3],  the  correction  term  n   did  not  arise  since  the

(including the nonlocal factors

transport  equation,  i.e.  to  the  amplitude.  Meanwhile,  the  geometric  phase  is  a  nonlocal  value, 

which cannot be attributed to the wave amplitude. The Berry phase can distort substantially the 

phase front. For example, for a ray with torsion, the phase front gradient has an additional fixed 

component  ϑ∇±

, which changes the wave vector and the phase velocity. As will be seen, the 

obtained correction term 

)1(n

 leads to the corrections in the geometrical optics equations, which 

are  supported  experimentally,  and  hence,  have  real  physical  grounds.  Note  that  in  view  of  the 

essential  dependence  of  the  geometric  phase  on  the  ray  trajectory,  the  correction  term

depends not only on the current coordinate  r , but also on the wave vector direction, that is, on 

the wave momentum. This points to the weak anisotropy of a locally isotropic medium.

(see Eq. (14)) in the ray Hamiltonian should be interpreted not as independent quantity but only 

as expressed in the end from the zero order Hamiltonian equations (see bellow). 

Equations (15) and (16) can be analyzed by applying the perturbation method in

These  are  the  familiar  geometrical  optics  equations  for  an  isotropic  medium  [3].  The  second

hence  they  should  be  considered  on  the  solutions  (trajectories)  of  zero  approximation.  As  a

l =

. As we will 

see later, equations (18) describe the deviations in a wave momentum and coordinates that are 

associated with the spatial and momentum gradients of the Berry phase, respectively. As will be 

 

9

seen, the first equation in (18) governs the emergence of Berry phase, while the second equation 

describes  the  deviations  of  the  rays  of  different  polarizations  by  virtue  of  the  optical  Magnus 

effect [7]. 

It is significant that the wave evolution for right and left circular polarizations is given by 

independent equations and thus these waves are the independent medium eigenmodes. This fact 

correlates  well  with  the  quantum-mechanical  notion  of  photons,  according  to  which  a  photon 

may  possess  the  helicity  equal  to  +1  or  –1  only,  which  correspond  to  right  and  left  circular 

polarizations. In the framework of a given approximation, an arbitrarily polarized wave cannot 

be treated independently, but only as a superposition of circular eigenmodes.  

3.3. Equation for momentum, Berry phases, and phase velocities. Consider initially the 

first equation in (18). First of all, let us note that after integration with the operator

, it 

exactly  defines  the  geometrical  term  ϑ  in  the  phase  (10),  (11).  The  first  equation  (18)  is 

responsible for the change of the momentum (wave vector) and the phase velocity of waves in 

absolute value, but not direction. To prove this, let’s multiply scalarly the first equation (18) by 

l

 and, taking into account that

When  integrating  Eq. (19),  we  assume  for  simplicity  that

.  Equation  (20)  follows 

immediately from the initial expressions (10), (11), and (14) for eikonals and refractive indices. 

When  integrating  along  the  ray,  two  terms  in  Eq. (20)  represent  the  dynamic  phase  and  the 

geometric  phase  (parts  of  the  eikonal),  respectively.  From  Eq. (20)  or  Eq. (14)  we  have  the 

following expression for the phase velocities of the left-hand and right-hand waves

It  should  be  noted  that  the  right-hand  side  of  the  first  equation  in  (18)  involves  also  the 

component that is orthogonal to 

l

. Nominally, it causes the deviation of the momentum from the 

direction of the zero momentum  p . However, this deviation does not exceed  k  in the order 

)0(

of magnitude and essentially depends on gauge transformations (9) and (12). The reason is that 

under  the  gauge  transformations  a  certain  part  of  the  phase  turns  into  the  amplitude,  with  a 

consequent slight distortion of the phase front (or small deviations of the front normal from the 

zero-approximation  direction).  The  momentum  (wave  vector),  however,  is  not  a  physically 

measurable  value  in  this  range  (in  view  of  the  uncertainty  relation),  and  hence,  the  above-

mentioned deviations are irrelevant to the values under observation. Among these values are the 

phase  (that  is,  an  integral  of  the  wave  vector  projection  onto  the  ray)  and  the  ray  trajectory 

accurate to a wavelength. From these arguments it follows that it makes sense to consider only 

the  longitudinal  component  in  the  right-hand  side  of  the  first  equation  in  (18)  resulting  in 

Eq. (20). After elimination of the immeasurable transversal deviations, the first equation in (18)

3.4. Equation for coordinates, the optical Magnus effect, and group velocities. We now 

turn our attention to the analysis of the second equation in (18). It describes the shift of the right 

and  left  circularly  polarized  rays,  which  is  associated  with  the  optical  Magnus  effect  [7].  The 

right-hand side of the second equation in (18) is responsible for the ray trajectory deviations, that 

is, for variations in the group velocity. As will be seen, this correction is directed orthogonally to

Note  now  that  equation  (24)  for  the  ray  shift  comprises  two  summands.  The  first  one,

  in  the  order  of  magnitude.  Evidently,  the  second  term  does  not  lead  to  observable 

physical  effects  and  depends  on  the  gauge  transformations  (9)  and  (12).  This  is  related  to  the 

uncertainty  of  the  notion  of  a  ray  trajectory  within  the  range  of  the  wavelength.  Like  Berry 

phase,  the  first  nonlocal  term  in  Eq. (24)  is  gauge-invariant.  Note  also  that  with  the  cyclic 

evolution, when the ray direction coincides with the initial one, we have  p

These ‘evolutionary’ equations can be solved without regard to Eqs. (17). However, the theory 

of Berry phases has clearly demonstrated that in a number of problems it is better to use general 

‘geometric’ equations (22) and (26) by integrating them in the  p -space. In particular, we could 

not have derived the above-discussed equations if we had not applied this approach dealing with 

the properties of locality and nonlocality. 

Note that the second equation in (27) corresponds precisely to the correction that has been 

introduced  into  the  geometrical  optics  equations  by  Zel’dovich  and  Liberman  [8].  It  has  also 

been shown in [8] that this equation describes properly, in agreement with experiments [7], the 

optical Magnus effect in a circular waveguide. However, in the geometrical optics of Zel’dovich 

and Liberman, the equation for momentum is free of the correction that corresponds to the first 

equation in (27), that is, this equation is missing Berry phase. As we have seen, this effect, being 

of the same order, may not be discarded in the complete theory. Besides, it should be noted that 

 

13

in  the  paper  [7]  the  polarization  of  an  arbitrary wave corresponds to its independent degree of 

freedom,  for  which  the  evolutionary  equations  are  written;  this  adds  complexity  to  the  theory. 

Meanwhile,  as  it  has  been  shown,  this  is  not  the  case.  For  every  eigenmode,  the  polarization 

(right-hand  or  left-hand  circular)  is  strictly  fixed  (the  helicity  is  the  adiabatic  invariant  of  a 

photon),  while  the  polarization  evolution  for  an  arbitrarily  polarized  wave  is  nothing  but  the 

result of the interference of two eigenmodes of fixed polarizations. This kind of interference is 

completely described within the context of our theory. 

It  follows  from  the  above  that  our  theory  makes  a  prediction  about  a  new  phenomenon, 

which is not present in the theory of the optical Magnus effect. In papers [7,8], the deviation of 

the  ray  center  of  gravity  in  relation  to  the  polarization  has  been  described.  For  example,  this 

deviation is zero for a linearly polarized ray. Meanwhile, as it has been shown, a single linearly 

polarized  ray  simply  does  not  exist.  When  propagating,  this  ray  will  split  into  two  circularly 

polarized independent rays. In Subsection 4.2, we suggest the simple scheme of the experiment 

for observing the predicted effect of splitting of a noncircularly polarized ray into two circularly 

polarized ones.  

From  Eqs. (26)  and  (27)  along  with  Eqs. (17)  the  expressions  for  the  group  velocities  of 

the waves of right-hand and left-hand polarizations follow:

4. EXAMPLES: RAY SHIFTS IN CIRCULAR WAVEGUIDES 

4.1  Rays  in  the  paraxial  approximation.  In  [7],  the  rotation  of  the  plane  of  meridional 

right-hand  and 

left-hand  circularly  polarized  rays  has  been  calculated 

in 

the  mode 

 

14

approximation. Then, in [8], the same effect has been calculated from the suggested correction to 

the geometrical optics equations, which is similar to the second equation in (27). The results of 

these calculations are found to be coincident and in good agreement with experimental data [7]. 

Thus  we  may  assert  that  the  theory  suggested  above  also  describes  adequately  the  optical 

Magnus effect in a circular waveguide. Nevertheless, we would like to present the calculation of 

this  effect,  which  is  based  not  on  equations  (27)  but  immediately  on  the  initial  equation  (16), 

virtual  ray  trajectories,  and  the  presence  of  Berry  phases.  This  will  allow  us  to  demonstrate 

clearly the physical and geometrical meaning of the theory constructed above. 

Consider a meridional ray propagating in the positive 

z

 direction in a circular waveguide 

with  a  gradient  parabolic  profile  in  the  paraxial  approximation.  Let  the  refractive  index  be  the 

following function of the distance 

r  to the waveguide center

waveguide.  Here  and  further,  unless  otherwise  specified,  we  imply  the  values  of  zero-order 

approximation Eqs. (17); for the sake of simplicity the indices are omitted. Let us introduce the 

natural cylindrical coordinates 

(r

zϕ . The ray propagation process will be observed from the 
,

),

waveguide end (Fig. 1). As it follows from Eqs. (16) or (18), the ray displacement is proportional 

to the momentum gradient of its Berry phase per a unit of length. Although the meridional ray 

represents a plane curve and its Berry phase is zero, the adjacent, virtual, rays may possess the 

Berry phase, and hence, its gradient will be different from zero. 

First note that variations in momentum components 

rp

 and 

zp

 do not move the trajectory 

away from the propagation plane, and hence, the derivatives 

rp∂∂ /

 and 

zp∂∂ /

 of Berry phase of 

the  meridional  ray  are  equal  to  zero.  Thus,  only 

ϕ-component  of  the  momentum  gradient  of 

Berry phase of the meridional ray will be different from zero. Therefore, with the use of (18), the 

following equation for the desired ray shift can be written:

Here, 

ϕj

 is the unit vector directed along the

the meridional ray (

0=ϕp

) equals zero. Consequently, to determine the gradient (30), we must 

consider  a  ray  close  to  the  meridional  one  and  possessing  small  value  of 

0≠ϕp

.  The  ray 

trajectories (given by equations (17)) in parabolic profile (29) admit analytical solutions and is 

fully considered in [13]. It is well known [2,4–6] that Berry phase (11) of the ray is equal to the 

oppositely-signed area that is swept by the tangential vector  l  on a unit sphere. In the Appendix, 

it is shown that in the paraxial approximation the tangential vector traces an ellipse on a small 

section of the unit sphere. The area of this ellipse equals

Hence it follows that the correction to the refractive index for a spiral trajectory is 

Formulas (32) and (33) are actually the averaging of the corresponding values over a period of 

the trajectory. It is quite sufficient, since ray shift is immeasurable for smaller scales; the effect 

shows itself over many periods. By substituting Eq. (32) into Eq. (30), we arrive at

ones  are  rotated  uniformly  clockwise  or  anticlockwise  depending  on  the  polarization  sign

This formula corresponds exactly to the results obtained in [7]. Its derivation has revealed 

that the optical Magnus effect is indeed closely related to the presence of the Berry phase in the 

system and its anisotropy. Let us remark that if one considered the ray similar to the meridional 

one in a planar waveguide, the ray shift would not be observed. This is because Berry phase in a 

planar waveguide is identically equal to zero for all rays. At the same time, the initial meridional 

ray may have precisely the same trajectory as it has in a circular waveguide. 

4.2. Splitting of a circular ray. Considering the ray shift effect from the viewpoint of the 

presence of Berry phase of the adjacent, virtual, rays, we can propose a straightforward scheme 

for  observing  both  the  optical  Magnus  effect  and  the  ray  splitting.  Let  us  consider  a  finite  ray 

propagating along a circle in the 

z =

const

 plane in a radially inhomogeneous medium (circular 

gradient waveguide) (Fig. 2). This kind of a ray corresponds to so-called modes of a whispering 

gallery. The ray by itself represents a plane trajectory with Berry phase equal to zero (

π2 , to be 

more  specific).  However,  the  adjacent  rays  with  small 

0≠zp

  become  spiral  and  gain  a 

geometric  phase.  This  suggests  at  once  that  the  ray  considered  will  shift  in  the  direction  of 

positive or negative 

z

 according to its polarization (see Fig. 2). If both of the waveguide ends 

are  open,  the  right-hand  polarized  wave  will  emerge  from  one  end,  whereas  the  left-hand 

 

17

polarized  wave  will  emerge  from  the  opposite  end.  This  kind  of  experiment  can  be  used  to 

demonstrate the splitting of a ray of mixed polarization into two circularly polarized eigen rays. 

Indeed,  if  the  initial  ray  is  linearly  polarized,  the  right  and  left  circularly  polarized  radiation 

appears from two waveguide ends to the observer. Notice that, according to the interpretation of 

the Magnus effect given in [7,8], the linearly polarized ray is free from any displacement. In fact, 

these works estimate only the shift of the ray center of gravity and this shift is zero for a linearly 

polarized ray (since the shifts of two equal circularly polarized ray compensate each other). The 

splitting  of  a  ray  of  mixed  polarization  into  two  circular  rays  can  be  obtained  only  from  the 

proposed theory. Hence the experiment under discussion can support our theory. 

The  analyzed  effect  can  be  estimated  easily  by  analogy  with  the  above  example.  It  is 

readily seen that the ray will be shifted in

The tangent vector 

l

 of the initial ray is moving along the equator of the unit sphere, and hence 

the  Berry  phase  over  one  period  of  the  trajectory  equals 

π2   (the  unit  hemisphere  area).  (At 

Fig. 2  we  consider  the  initial  ray  that  corresponds  to  the  anti-clockwise  movement  when  seen 

from the negative 

z

 side. Therefore the area swept by the tangent vector on the unit sphere is 

negative and the Berry phase is positive.) For the ray with small 

, the tangent vector will be

moving  along  the  parallel  close  to  the  equator;  this  will  result  in  a  small  deviation  of  the

5. CONCLUSIONS 

Above,  the  modified  geometrical  optics  theory  has  been  constructed  for  a  smoothly 

inhomogeneous isotropic medium. In our derivations, we rely in large measure on the concept of 

locality and nonlocality, which allows us to find the proper way of separating complex phases 

and  complex  amplitudes  of  the  wave  solutions.  It  turns  out  that  all  nonlocal  terms  should  be 

assigned to the wave phase and not to the amplitude. We have derived the first-order geometrical 

optics  equations  that  properly  and  in  a  uniform  way  describe  the  effect  of  Berry’s  geometric 

phases and the optical Magnus effect, which have been introduced independently of each other 

before [4–6,7,8].  

We  have  shown  that  in  the  first  geometrical  optics  approximation  a  smoothly 

inhomogeneous locally isotropic medium becomes weakly anisotropic. The eigenmodes of this 

medium  are  the  waves  of  right  and  left  circular  polarizations.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the 

 

19

polarization form of circular waves remains unchanged during their propagation in a smoothly 

inhomogeneous  medium.  (An  elliptically  polarized  wave  changes  its  own  polarization  in 

accordance  with  the  Rytov  law  [1−3],  which  is  merely  the  result  of  the  interference  of  two 

eigenmodes with different phase velocities.3)) The eikonals of the right and left circular modes 

differ by the arising Berry phase of opposite signs Eq. (10). Hence, with the use of the eikonal 

equation, we have obtained the effective refractive indices (14) for circular modes. An essential 

dependence of the Berry phase not only on the coordinates but also on the wave vector direction 

determines a weak anisotropy of the medium. 

From the Hamilton principle, for the obtained refractive indices, we have constructed ray 

equations  (17)  and  (18),  which  involve  the  correction  terms  of  the  first  order  in 

1

−k
0

.  These 

corrections,  being  proportional  to  the  spatial  and  momentum  gradients  of  Berry  phase, 

respectively, determine the deviations in momentums and coordinates for right and left circular 

waves.  We  have  used  the  separation  of  local  and  nonlocal  terms  to  bring  these  equations  to  a 

more  convenient  form  like  Eqs. (22),  (26)  or  (27).  At  the  same  time,  we  have  shown  that  the 

correction  in  the  equation  for  momentum  causes  the  difference  in  absolute  value  of  the  phase 

velocities, while the correction in the equation for coordinates is responsible for the difference in 

direction of the group velocities. The former effect describes the appearance of Berry phases of 

the wave solutions, whereas the latter one is associated with the deviation of the rays of different 

polarizations, which has been called before the optical Magnus effect [7,8]. 

Hence  the  Berry  phases,  as  well  as  the  optical  Magnus  effect,  are  the  accompanying 

phenomena  that  arise  in  the  same  order  k

  in  the  geometrical  optics  equations.  These 

1

−
0

phenomena describe the divergence in phase and trajectory, respectively, between the waves of 

different  polarizations.  We  have  found  that  the  formula  for  the  ray  shifts  for  different 

                                                 
3) The conclusion about difference in phase velocities of right and left circular waves is contained already in 

the pioneer work [1]. However, the corresponding formula in that paper is not correct because the calculations were 

made in the rotational reference frame related to Frenet trihedron of the ray. 

 

20

polarizations  Eq. (25)  is  geometric  in  character,  just  like  the  Berry  phase,  and  represents  a 

contour  integral  in  the  momentum  space.  Thus,  both  the  optical  Magnus  effect  and  the  Berry 

phase are fundamental nonlocal topological phenomena. It follows that in a one-dimensionally 

inhomogeneous medium (the medium with plane ray trajectories and free from Berry phases) the 

ray shift does not occur. 

In addition to the above-listed findings, the suggested theory predicts a novel effect, which 

is  not  contained  in  the  preceding  theory  of  the  optical  Magnus  effect  [7,8].  Namely,  a  ray  of 

mixed  polarization  not  only  undergoes  the  displacement  of  its  center  of  gravity  but  also  splits 

into  two  independent  rays  of  right  and  left  circular  polarizations.  Thus,  in  the  approximation 

considered, no independent ray of arbitrarily mixed polarization exists. This ray may occur only 

as a result of the interference of the circular eigen rays propagating along different trajectories. 

Our theory follows immediately from Maxwell’s equations, the eikonal equations, and the 

Hamilton equations for rays. This theory describes from a unified standpoint repeatedly observed 

phenomena:  Berry  phase  and  the  optical  Magnus  effect, which confirms its validity. Note also 

that  the  correction  obtained  in  the  coordinate  equation  of  geometrical  optics  is  exactly  in  line 

with 

the  correction 

introduced  phenomenologically  by  Liberman  and  Zel’dovich  [8]. 

Consequently, this correction describes reliably the experimental data associated with the optical 

Magnus effect [7]. At the same time, geometrical optics of the paper [8] lacks the correction of 

the  same  order  in  the  momentum  equation,  without  which  the  theory  is  not  complete  (Berry 

phase  is  lacking)  and  cannot  describe  the  connection  between  the  two  phenomena  and  their 

topological nature.  

In  parallel  with  the  general  theory,  we  have  analyzed  particular  examples  (both  familiar 

and novel) of ray displacements for different polarizations. They fully support the inferences of 

our  theory.  With  the  help  of  the  theory  suggested,  we  have  succeeded  in  calculating  and 

analyzing  the  ray  shifts  associated  with  the  optical  Magnus  effect.  We  have  also  proposed  a 

 

21

novel  scheme  of  the  experiment  that  allows  one  to  observe  the  splitting  effect  for  the  rays  of 

mixed polarization. 

It worth noticing that the effects of the ray deviations have the same order in magnitude, 

1

−k
0

,  as  the  ray  diffraction.  Therefore  the  diffraction  spreading  interferes  significantly  with  the 

ray splitting. Nevertheless observations of the ray deviations are possible (see, for example, [7]) 

against  the  background  of  the  diffraction  spreading,  since  they  are  connected  with  the 

polarization characteristics of the ray. 

Finally  note  that,  owing  to  the  general  character  of  Berry  phase  as  the  phenomenon 

observed  in  dynamic  systems,  the  analogs  for  the  optical  Magnus  effect  would  be  expected  to 

occur in many systems. In particular, the effect of this kind has to occur during the propagation 

of  quantum  particles  of  various  spins  in  external  fields  (see,  for  example,  [14]  and  references 

there).

APPENDIX А: THE MOTION OF THE TANGENTIAL VECTOR OF A RAY IN A 

CIRCULAR WAVEGUIDE OF PARABOLIC PROFILE 

Bellow  we  consider  the  ray  equations  in  the  geometrical  optics  zero  approximation.  It  is 

readily seen from equations (17) (see also [3,13]) that in cylindrically inhomogeneous medium a 

wave possesses two ray invariants that are constant along the trajectory 

I =1

zp

 and 

I

ϕ=

/ rrp
0

.

Considering  that 

n/pl =

,  these  invariants  can  be  rewritten  in  terms  of  the  tangent  vector 

component. Note also that in the paraxial approximation, the vector 

l

 is almost aligned with 

z

-

axis. The transversal component can be written as

Eq. (А1).  For  the  parabolic  profile  (29),  the  ray  trajectory  can  be  obtained  analytically  from 

Eqs. (17).  Its  projection  onto  a  circular  cross-section  of  the  waveguide  represents  an  ellipse 

(Fig. 1) and is given by equation [13]

Hence it follows that the end of the tangent vector is tracing an ellipse around the pole on the 

unit  sphere.  The  pole  on  the  sphere  corresponds  exactly  to

occupies  a  small  area,  within  which  the  surface  may  be  treated  as  a  part  of  a  plane.  Using

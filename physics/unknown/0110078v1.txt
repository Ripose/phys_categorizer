ABSTRACT 
The possibility to use sucrose solutions as medium for X-ray and neutron small-angle scattering 
 
experiments  has  been  explored  for  dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine  (DMPC)  vesicles  and  mixed 
DMPC/C12E8  aggregates.  The  influence  of  sucrose  concentration  on  phospholipid  vesicles  size  and 
polydispersity has been investigated by complimentary X-ray and neutron scattering. Sucrose solutions 
decreased vesicle size and polydispersity and increased a contrast between phospholipid membrane and 
bulk solvent sufficiently for X-rays. 40% sucrose in H2O increased X-ray contrast by up to 10 times 
compared  to  pure  H2O.  The  range  of  sucrose  concentration  30%-40%  created  the  best  experimental 
conditions for the X-ray small-angle experiment with phospholipid vesicles.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Vesicles are very  important in many different areas of science and technology. They serve as 
delivery  agents  for  drugs,  genetic  materials  and  enzymes  through  living  cell  membrane  and  other 
hydrophobic  barriers  in  pharmacology,  medicine,  genetic  engineering,  cosmetic  and  food  industry 
[1,2].  Vesicle  size  appears  to  be  a  major  factor  in  its  permeation  through  tumor  microvessels  and  its 
local  residence  in  tumor  tissue.  A  vesicle  size  of  1000Å  may  be  a  pivotal  size  of  vesicles  for  tumor 
targeting and long vesicle circulation in blood [3].  

The  small-angle  X-ray  (SAXS)  and  neutron  (SANS)  scattering  experiment  on  vesicles  from 
phospholipids  serving  as  a  model  biological  membranes  is  a  useful  method  for  determination  of 
membrane  and  vesicle  structure  [4-9].  The  Guinier  approximation  of  SANS  spectra  was  used  for  the 
calculation  of  membrane  thickness  of  egg  yolk  phosphatidylcholine  vesicles  (dl=41.7Å  at  20oC), 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine  (DPPC)  vesicles  (dl=49.6Å  at  20oC),  and  mixed  lipid/surfactant 
vesicles [6-8]. A strip-function model of evaluating SANS curves was developed recently which allows 
to  determine  important  membrane  parameters    describing  the  geometry  and  hydration  of  large 
oligolamellar  vesicles  [9].  The  radius  of  large  unilamellar  vesicles  (R≥1000 Å)  at  itself  cannot  be 
determined  from  SANS  or  SAXS  scattering  experiment  due  to  the  technical  limitation  of  modern 
spectrometers  and  large  polydispersity  of  vesicles  in  size  and  morphology  [9-11].  The  methods  to 
create small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with low polydispersity such as fast dilution or temperature 
jump protocol were developed for mixed lipid/surfactant systems [5,12]. The problem of creation of the 
SUVs with low polydispersity from a pure lipid system without surfactant are not solved till now. 

The  application  of  X-ray  small-angle  scattering  to  the  study  of  vesicular  systems  has  a 
limitation due to a weak contrast between phospholipid bilayer and water. Sucrose solutions were used 
for the contrast variation make X-ray scattering of myoglobin comparable to the neutron one [13]. The 
interaction of sugars with phospholipid molecules is not clear. The experimental results obtained with 
multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) and unilamelar vesicles (ULVs) are in contradiction. Trehalose does not 
influence the main transition temperature Tm of DMPC ULVs, but with MLVs the Tm is increased by 
the presence of trehalose [14]. For DMPC MLVs, sucrose causes a slight increase of Tm by the value 
less than 2oC for sucrose concentration from 0 up to 69% [15].  

In  our  previous  study,  the  40%  sucrose  solution  was  used  for  the  investigation  of  micelle  to 
vesicle transition in the mixed DMPC/ionic surfactant system via SAXS [5]. In the present study, the 
possibility to use sucrose solutions as medium for X-ray and neutron small-angle scattering experiment 
was explored  for DMPC vesicles and mixed DMPC/nonionic surfactant aggregates. The influence of 
sucrose  concentration  on  phospholipid  vesicles  size  and  polydispersity  has  been  investigated  by 
complimentary X-ray and neutron scattering. 
 
2. MATERIALS AND SAMPLE PREPARATION 
 
Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine  (DMPC)  -  C36H72NO8P,  8  Lauryl  Ether  (C12E8)  - 
C25H58O9,  sucrose  -  C12H22O11  were  purchased  from  Sigma  (France),  D2O  (99.9%  deuteration) 
from  Isotop  (Russia).  H2O  was  of  Millipore  standard  (18MΩ⋅cm).  The  1%  (w/w)  of  DMPC  was 
dissolved in sucrose/water solution. The samples were heated to a temperature above the main phase 
transition (Tm=23oC) and then cooled down to 10oC. The cooling-heating cycle was repeated 5 times 
with sample shaking. MLVs were created under this process. For the formation of unilamellar vesicles 
the  obtained  suspension  of  MLVs  was  passed  25  times  through  polycarbonate  filter  with  500Å  pore 
diameter of LiposoFast Basic extruder (Avestin, Canada) [16].

3. METHODS 
 
The  SAXS  measurements  were  carried  out  at  D22  spectrometer  of  DCI  synchrotron  ring  at 
LURE,  France,  and  SANS  measurements  -  at  YuMO  spectrometer  of  pulse  neutron  reactor  IBR-2  at 
Dubna, Russia [17,18].  

The model of infinitely thin sphere was applied to interpret the SAXS curves in the region of 
scattering  vector  q  from  0.005Å-1  to  0.04Å-1  [5].  The  macroscopic  cross  section  of  vesicles  in  this

convolution of Eqs. (3) and (4) from Rmin=70Å to Rmax=2000Å. The Ic(q) value was corrected by the

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.1. SANS study 

.  

The scattering cross sections of DMPC vesicles were measured in pure D2O and in D2O with 5, 
10,  and  20%  sucrose  (w/w)  at  T=30oC  (liquid  Lα  phase  of  DMPC)  [15].  The  experimental  spectra 
were fitted with Schulz distribution function according to Eqs. (3) and (4). Results of calculations are 
presented  at  Table 1.  The  increase  of  sucrose  concentration  in  the  solution  decreases  the  average 
vesicles  radius  from  the  value  of  260Å  at  0%  sucrose  to  the  value  of  200Å  at  20%  sucrose  and 
decreases  the  vesicles  polydispersity  from  the  value  of  37%  to  the  value  of  27%,  respectively.  The 
membrane thickness dl is not influenced by sucrose with the accuracy of applied method. Additionally, 
the spectrum from vesicles in the 20% sucrose solution was fitted with Gaussian distribution function. 
The  experimental  spectra  and  fitted  curves  for  the  DMPC  vesicles  in  D2O  with  20%  sucrose  are 
presented  in  Fig. 1.  The  fitted  curves  with  Schulz  and  Gaussian  distribution  functions  practically 
coincide. The results of application of the hollow sphere model with the Gaussian distribution give the 

_
=190±5Å, dl=34.8±0.5Å, σ=50±5Å, P=31%, which are in agreement with results 
following values:  R
obtained  with  Schulz  distribution  function,  except  the  value  of  polydispersity.  The  application  of 
Gaussian distribution gives polydispersity of 31% that is larger than the value of 27% obtained with the 
Schulz distribution function.  
The measurements of the membrane thickness of LUVs at T=10oC (gel Lβ′-phase of DMPC) 
 
were  carried  out  to  check  conclusion  about  permanent  DMPC  membrane  thickness  in  the  liquid  Lα 
phase.  The  LUVs  were  prepared  by  extrusion  through  1000Å  pores  [16].  The  SANS  measurements 
were carried out in the sucrose/D2O solutions with 0%, 20%, 30%, 40% sucrose concentrations. The 
membrane  thickness  dl  was  calculated  from  the  slope  of  Kratky-Porod  plot  according  to  the  Guinier 
approximation  as  described  in  [7-8,  18,  22].  The  results  of  calculations  are  presented  in  Fig. 2.  The 
decrease of DMPC membrane thickness dl at T=10oC by the value of 1.4±1.8Å upon the increase of 
sucrose concentration by 40% is within the interval of experimental errors and can be explained as a 
result  of  the  contrast  decrease.  The  decrease  of  the  contrast  leads  to  the  underestimation  of  the 
membrane  thickness  in  the  Guinier  approximation  [19,  20].  The  same  Guinier  approximation  was 
applied to calculate the DMPC membrane thickness in the liquid Lα phase at T=30oC. dl=38.8±0.8Å 
was  evaluated  from  the  Kratky-Porod  plot  for  DMPC  vesicles  in  D2O.  The  dl  calculated  from  the 
Kratky-Porod  plot  is  by  3.6±1.0Å  larger  than  the  dl  calculated  from  the  hollow  sphere  model, 
dl=35.2±0.2Å.  The  choice  between  two  different  values  of  the  dl  will  be  made  in  the  SAXS  study 
section. 

DMPC membrane thickness is not influenced by sucrose in the range of sucrose concentration 
from 0% to 40%. It is an important fact which gives us opportunity to consider sucrose as prospective 
medium for SAXS and SANS experiments with phospholipid vesicles.  

 
4.2. SAXS study 
Phospholipid membranes are objects with a very poor contrast for X-ray. Under the assumption 
 
that  the  structure  of  lipid  membrane  is  not  perturbed  by  the  addition  of  sucrose  and  that  no  specific 
adsorption of sucrose or water occurs at the membrane surface, the X-ray scattering length density of

where,  χ-  sucrose  concentration  (w/w),  D(χ)-  density  of  sucrose/water  solution,  g/cm3  [21].  X-ray 
contrast between membrane and solvent is determined as ∆ρ = ρDMPC − ρsolvent.  
Fig. 3 presents the calculated value of ρsolvent at T=30oC in the range of sucrose concentrations from 
0 to 60% and the values of ρ for two types of phospholipids in liquid Lα-phase: DMPC and DPPC. The 
contrast for DMPC molecule in pure water is positive and for DPPC molecule is negative, but in any 
case  the  absolute  value  of  contrast  is  about  0.14⋅1010 cm-2.  The  absolute  value  of  contrast  ∆ρ  for 
sucrose solution increases sufficiently with the increase of sucrose concentration. 40% sucrose in H2O 
increase  X-ray  contrast  by  up  to  10  times  compared  to  pure  H2O.  The  macroscopic  cross  section  of 
DMPC vesicles at T=30oC increases with the increase of sucrose concentration due to the increase in 
the contrast as shown in Fig. 4. At sucrose concentration 15% the statistical errors decreased down to 
the  values  that  give  opportunity  for  the  model  application.  The  results  of  the  application  of  the 
infinitely thin sphere model (Eqs. (1) and (2)) to the experimental spectra and the calculated by Eq. (5) 
values of contrast are presented in Table 2. These theoretical values of contrast were compared with the 
experimentally  determined  values  of  contrast,  that  is  calculated  from  the  measured  values  of 

_
, σ, and dl, according to the Eqs. (1) and (2). The dl was determined from 
macroscopic cross section,  R
the SANS experiment. SANS results at T=30oC gave two different values for the membrane thickness:. 
The  application  of  dl=38.8Å  for  the  calculation  of  the  experimental  value  of  the  contrast  gave  good 
coincidence with the theoretical value. The application of dl=35.2Å leads to the disagreement between 
theory  and  experiment.  Consequently,  the  contrast  analysis  gave  argument  to  the  rights  of 
dl=38.8Å±0.8Å for DMPC membrane thickness at T=30oC.  

As  it  is  seen  from  Table 2,  the  discrepancy  between  calculated  and  measured  contrast  is  no 
greater than 20%, except for big difference at 50% sucrose. The big error for 50% sucrose arises from 
the  uncertainty  in  the  value  of  vesicle  radius  which  is  130±105Å.  The  20%  difference  between 
calculated and measured values of the contrast for all sucrose concentrations in the range of 15%-45% 
are in agreement with the minimum value of polydispersity, 33%. The average radius of vesicles and 
polydispersity have the minimum values in the range of sucrose concentrations 30-40%. This interval 
exhibits the best experimental conditions for SAXS. Figs. 5 and 6 demonstrate this conclusion for the 
case  of  micellar  to  lamellar  transitions    in  the  DMPC/C12E8  system  [8].  This  system  possesses  a 
property of supramolecular aggregates transformation from the micelles phase to lamellar phase upon 
the temperature alteration [22, 23]. The DMPC/C12E8 system was studied by SANS in D2O (Fig. 5) 
and by SAXS in 40% sucrose solution (Fig. 6). The macroscopic cross section for neutrons and X-rays 
can  be  compared  at  T=10°C.  The  lines  extrapolating  to  the  zero  value  of  the  scattering  vector  give 
dΣ/dΩ(0)=0.6cm–1  for  X-ray  scattering  and  dΣ/dΩ(0)=9.9cm–1  for  neutron  scattering.  The  DMPC 
concentration  in  neutron  experiment  is  two  times  smaller  of  the  DMPC  concentration  in  X-ray 
experiment.  Consequently,  the  normalized  to  the  DMPC  quantity  macroscopic  cross  sections  of 
neutrons  and  X-rays  differ  by  a  factor  33.  Taking  into  account  the  high  flux  of  X-rays  at  the 
synchrotron  source,  we  can  conclude  that  the  introduction  of  sucrose  solutions  for  X-ray  scattering 
gives comparable experimental conditions for the use of D2O for neutron scattering.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Neutron  and  X-ray  small-angle  scattering  are  powerful  complementary  tools  for  the 
investigation  of  physicochemical  systems  of  biological  interest  like  model  membranes  and  mixed 
lipid/surfactant  systems.  The  neutron  scattering  is  advantageous  when  partly  or  fully  deuterated 
molecules  can  be  synthesized  and  used  as  deuterated  labels  in  the  sample.  For  non-deuterated 
materials, resolution and flux of the X-ray scattering at a synchrotron source are of extreme interest.  
Sucrose  solutions  have  three  advantages.  First  is  the  possibility  to  create  a  monodispersed 
 
population  of  vesicles,  which  sufficiently  improves  the  experimental  conditions  to  study  vesicles 
structure.  Second  is  the  increase  in  intensity,  which  is  large  enough  to  allow  for  the  study  of  the 
structure  of  diluted  aggregates  by  SAXS.  Third  is  the  constant  membrane  thickness  at  sucrose 
concentration  below  40%.  Sucrose/water  solutions  are  prospective  media  for  the  SAXS  and  SANS 
application  to  the  investigation  of  vesicles  structure  and  structure  of  mixed  lipid/surfactant  systems. 
The  range  of  sucrose  concentration  30%-40%  create  the  best  experimental  conditions  for  the  X-ray 
small-angle experiment with phospholipid vesicles.

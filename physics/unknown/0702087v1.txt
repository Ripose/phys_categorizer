UD(r) = a0(1-r/r0)2 = a0(1-N)2=a0(N-1)2 =½ker2
UK(r) = A(1-r0/r)2 = A(1-1/N)2 =(A/N2)(N-1)2 

 
First principles prove why a recent claim [R.-H. Xie and P.S. Hsu, Physical Review Letters, 96, 243201 (2006)] on the 
scaling power of a covalent Sutherland parameter to expose a universal function cannot be validated.  
 
Xie and Hsu found a universal function valid for 200 bonds [1] and say that (i) contrary to [3], the Sutherland 
parameter is a valid scaling factor and that (ii) ‘Based on the scaling analysis of 300 diatomic molecules, I pointed out [3] 
that the Sutherland parameter Δ can never be a universal scaling factor’, two wrong interpretations of [3]. Contrary to 
[1], I showed 25 years ago [4] that a covalent Sutherland parameter Δ is not universal, since its ionic equivalent 
performs much better [3,4]. Xie and Hsu’s wrong assessment of my work may be due to omissions of [3,4] in 
[2], as recognized by Xie [5] (see also [6]). Xie’s 200-bond study [2] cites the 150 bonds in [7] but not my 400-
bonds  [3].  Xie  and  Hsu  do  not  differentiate  between  covalent  an  ionic  Sutherland  parameters  [4],  a  useful 
distinction according to [8]. Ref. [1] refers to 3 parameters α, β and γ [2], needed to improve the bad QM PEC 
+. It is known [4,7,8] that 3 parameters suffice to align theoretical with observed 
(potential energy curve) for H2
PECs. For scaling, Dunham expansion [1] needs the covalent Sutherland parameter Δcov= ½ker0
2/Dcov=(r0/L2)2, 
where Ln=(n!Dcov/fn)1/n and nth force constant fn=dnU(r)/drn but [1] does not consider the ionic alternative.  
2/Dcov (for A+B→AB), used 
First principles explain why scaling with covalent Sutherland parameter Δcov=½ker0
in [1,2], is less efficient than with ionic Δion=½ker0
2/Dion (for A++B-→AB) [3,4]. Solving wave  equations for 
bonds experienced difficulties ever since 1930. Fixing asymptotes as Dcov leaves potentials uncertain (Morse, 
Pekeris, Dunham…), while fixing potentials (Coulomb, Kratzer) gives asymptote problems. This dilemma can 
be rationalized with covalent and ionic Sutherland parameters. Analytically, the 2 are differentiated with Hooke-
type Dunham UD(r) and Coulomb-type Kratzer UK(r) oscillators with asymptotes a0 and A [3,4,9] 
 
 
Both are zero at N=1 but Dunham’s oscillator (1) can never converge to its own asymptote a0 and expansions 
are needed [9]. Kratzer’s (2) always converges to A even without expansions [9]. Force constants ke=2Dcov/r0
2 
for (1) and k’e=2A/r0
cannot be calculated simply from first principles and is usually (very) different from Dcov. Then, if Dunham’s 
(1) were used for scaling (with a covalent Sutherland parameter Δcov=a0/Dcov), drastic adaptations are needed at 
either side of r0. With a Kratzer Coulomb law –e2/r in (2) for ionic bonding (conjugate with nuclear repulsion 
in a B-O approximation), the force constant is available analytically from first principles: k’e=e2/r0
A=½e2/r0, which secures Δion=½(e2/r0)/Dion, readily understood with classical physics. U(r0)=-e2/r0, the ionic 
bond energy [3,4,9], gives Δion≈½. Despite its simplicity, this leads for so-called covalent bond H2 (r0=0,7414 Å) 
to A=½e2/r0 =78300 cm-1 and k’e=e2/r0
Dunham asymptote a0=79500 cm-1 in (1) and ke=ωe/4Be= 5,75·105 dyne/cm. For H2, this ionic ab initio theory 
gives vibrational frequency ωe=4390 cm-1, close to observed ωe=4400 cm-1. This nearly exact first principles 
result for H2, only possible with Kratzer’s (2), makes a physically reliable ionic Sutherland parameter more 
suited than a covalent one. Since this first principles connection for chemical bonding is absent in [1,2], Xie and 
Hsu wrongly assess some essentials of molecular scaling related to (1) and (2) as exposed in [3,4,9]. 
Kratzer’s (2) not only shows in a symmetry reduced Hamiltonian for H2 [8] but also in Sommerfeld’s famous 
double square root equation for the H fine structure [10], later recovered by Dirac in QED [11]. Sommerfeld-
Kratzer’s H2 Coulomb-based universal potential UK(N)=½(e2/r0)(1-1/N)2 in (2) proves exactly why prototype 
H2 is for molecular what prototype H and Bohr’s UB(n)=½(e2/rB)(1-1/n2) is for atomic spectroscopy [3]. 
Then, Kratzer-type scaling with an ionic Sutherland parameter [3,4,9] becomes essential, despite conclusions in [1,2].

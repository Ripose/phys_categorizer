Abstract

A resolution of the Loschmidt paradox on Boltzmann´s H-theorem is proposed,

based on some new concepts concerning motion backwards in time. The key to this

resolution,   taken   from   our   interpretation   of   “motion   backwards   in   time”,   is   the

associated notion of negative mass, attributed to particles moving backwards in time,

which we call retro-particles, or simply retrons.

1. Introduction

It is well known the Boltzmann H-theorem. According to this theorem, in a gas

with velocity distribution f(v, t), the H-function, that is the quantity

(2)

One of the early classical objections to this theorem was the reversibility objection

raised by Loschmidt [1, 2, 3]. According to this objection the H-theorem must be

incorrect because of the well known invariance of the laws of Mechanics under the

time reversal t  ﬁ

  t´ = -t. Thus, it must be incorrect because the reversibility at the

microscopic level, on which it is based, cannot lead to macroscopic irreversibility,

which is expressed by the relation (2).

To   be   more   clear,   because   the   individual   collisions   in   the   gas   are   temporally

reversible, if we reverse the motions of the particles constituting the gas at the same

time, that is if we simply reverse the direction of time, by using the time t´ = -t, the

system will pass through the same states, but in the opposite order, and the new H-

function, say H´, should increase, that is it should
tdHd

But, as it is evident, the velocities do not change(*),that is v ﬁ

 v´ = v, while t ﬁ

 t´ = -t

in the definition (1), so that H ﬁ

and the H-theorem gives again

(*) If the motion backwards in time is described by the same world line with the motion forward in time,

but followed in the opposite direction of course, we would have at the same time dx ﬁ

 dx´ = -dx for the

spatial coordinates, besides dt ﬁ

 dt´ = -dt, so that v ﬁ

 v´ = v by the definition of velocity.

because, if m were negative, S could not have a minimum, required by the principle of

least   action,   since   then   we   could   make   S   as   small   (negative)   as   we   wanted,   by

choosing v sufficiently large. Thus also, because of eqn. (8), we must take

for retroparticles. The basic feature of these formulae is that they give a momentum of

the same  direction with the velocity for  normal  particles,  but a momentum  and a

velocity of opposite directions for retro-particles. If the world line of a retroparticle is

the   same   (but   of   the   opposite   direction)   as   compared   to   the   world   line   of   a

corresponding normal particle, then obviously  v´  =  v  (see (*)) and, since m´ = -m,

formulae (14) and (15) give opposite momenta, because they become respectively

momenta rather, instead of the velocities. Then, because of formula (14), or (16), the

Now we reverse the time and use the time t´ = -t. We also use a prime in the new

H-functions  in order to distinguish them from the old ones. It is  obvious  that the

normal particles with respect to the time t will be retroparticles with respect to the

time t´ on the one hand, and on the other hand conversely the retroparticles in the time

t will be normal particles in the time t´. Thus we have the relations 
H

(28)

Therefore, concerning normal particles in the time t, combination of eqns. (19) (H-

          

          

          

          

          

          

          

          

          

      

(29)

in accordance with Loschmidt´s relation (3). Boltzmann´s relation (5) corresponds to

normal particles in the time t´. Combination of eqns. (26) (anti H-theorem) and (28)

theorem) and (27) gives

(30)

Thus for motion backwards in time (retroparticles) we have to refer to the anti H-

theorem  rather  than to   the H-theorem  (normal  particles).   In this   way,  the  anti   H-

theorem gives eqn. (30), despite the fact that the H-theorem gives eqn. (29). This latter

theorem refers only to normal particles, while for retrons, i.e. for motion backwards

in time, the anti-theorem holds. Thus the resolution of Loschmidt´s paradox has been

achieved.

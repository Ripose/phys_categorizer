Abstract 

The day-to day fluctuations of Dow Jones Index exhibit fractal fluctuations, 
namely, a zigzag pattern of successive increases followed by decreases on all 
space-time  scales.  Self-similar  fractal  fluctuations  are  generic  to  dynamical 
systems  in  nature  and  imply  long-range  space-time  correlations.  The 
apparently unpredictable (chaotic) fluctuations of dynamical systems exhibit 
underlying order with the power spectra exhibiting inverse power law form, 
now  identified  as  self-organized  criticality.  The  physics  of  self-organized 
criticality  is  not  yet  identified.  A  general  systems  theory  developed  by  the 
author shows that self-similar fractal fluctuations are signatures of quantum-
like chaos in dynamical systems of all size scales ranging from the subatomic 
dynamics of quantum systems to macro-scale fluid flows. The model predicts 
the universal inverse power-law form of the statistical normal distribution for 
the power spectra of fractal space-time fluctuations of dynamical systems. In 
this  paper  it  is  shown  that  the  power  spectrum  of  100  years  of  normalized 
month  to  month  fluctuations  of  Dow  Jones  index  exhibits  the  universal 
inverse power law form of the statistical normal distribution consistent with 
model  prediction.  It  is  shown  that  prediction  of  times  of  occurrence  of 
maxima and minima during the two years subsequent to the data period used 
for the study is possible using the dominant peak periodicities obtained from 
the continuous periodogram spectral analysis of historic data.  

1. Introduction 

Dow  Jones  Index,  an  indicator  of  aggregate  stock  market  activity  exhibits  irregular 
fractal fluctuations and exact prediction is difficult. Such fractal fluctuations generic 
to  dynamical  systems  in  nature  such  as  fluid  flows,  heartbeat  patterns,  rainfall, 
population  growth,  etc.,  is  now  (since  1980s)  a  multidisciplinary  intensive  field  of 
study,  namely,  complexity  and  chaos  (Gleick,  1987).  Fractal  fluctuations  are  self-
similar characterized by successive increases followed by decreases on all space-time 
scales. The power spectra of fractal fluctuations follow inverse power law of form f-a 
where f is the frequency and the scale factor a varies for different frequency ranges, 
implying  multifractal  fluctuation  structure.  Self-similarity  implies  long-range  space-
time  correlations  and 
identified  as  self-organized  criticality  (Bak,  Tang, 
Wiesenfeld,  1987,  1988;  Bak  and  Chen,  1991,  Turcotte  and  Rundle,  2002).  The 

is

physics  of  self-organized  criticality  is  not  yet  identified.  Selforganized  criticality 
represents  an  attempt  to  extend  the  universality  and  scaling  of  the  critical  point  to 
many-body systems far from equilibrium (McCauley, 2004). 

Stanley  et  al  (2002)  discus  some  of  the  similarities  between  work  being  done  by 
economists and by physicists seeking to contribute to economics. They also mention 
some  of  the  differences  in  the  approaches  taken  and  seek  to  justify  these  different 
approaches by developing the argument that by approaching the same problem from 
different  points  of  view,  new  results  might  emerge.  In  particular,  they  review  two 
newly  discovered  scaling  results  that  appear  to  be  universal,  in  the  sense  that  they 
hold  for  widely  different  economies  as  well  as  for  different  time  periods:  (i)  the 
fluctuation  of  price  changes  of  any  stock  market  is  characterized  by  a  probability 
density  function,  which  is  a  simple  power  law  with  exponent  -4  extending  over  102 
SDs (a factor of 108 on the y axis); this result is analogous to the Gutenberg-Richter 
power law describing the histogram of earthquakes of a given strength; and (ii) for a 
wide range of economic organizations, the histogram shows how size of organization 
is inversely correlated to fluctuations in size with an exponent (cid:1) 0.2. Neither of these 
two new empirical laws have a firm theoretical foundation. 

Power  laws  appear  to  describe  histograms  of  relevant  financial  fluctuations,  such 
as fluctuations in stock price, trading volume and the number of trades. Surprisingly, 
the  exponents  that  characterize  these  power  laws  are  similar  for  different  types  and 
sizes  of  markets,  for  different  market  trends  and  even  for  different  countries  - 
suggesting that a generic theoretical basis may underlie these phenomena (Gabaix et 
al., 2003). 

An  empirical  investigation  about  the  possibility  that  the  market  is  in  a  self-
organized  critical  state  (SOC)  show  a  power  law  behaviour  in  the  avalanche  size, 
duration  and  laminar  times  during  high  activity  period  (Bartolozzi,  Leinweber  and 
Thomas, .2005). 

1.1 Stock market fractal fluctuations, Elliot waves and Fibonacci series 
The  self-similar  fluctuations  in  stock  market  price  fluctuations  was  identified  in  the 
1930s as waves within waves by R. N. Elliot (Elliot, 1938; Frost and Prechter, 1998) 
who also found that the successive waves are in relation with each other through the 
Fibonacci  number  series.  The  golden  mean  underlies  Fibonacci  number  series.  The 
golden  mean  is  the  most  irrational  number  and  is  associated  with  the  Fibonacci  
mathematical  sequence  1,  1,  2,  3,  5,  8,  ......  where  each  term  is  the  sum  of  the  two 
previous terms and the ratio of each term to the previous term approaches the golden 
mean t equal to (1+(cid:214)5)/2 (cid:1) 1.618.  

That the apparently irregular fractal patterns are governed by the precise geometry 
of  the  Fibonacci  number  series  was  identified  more  than  150  years  ago  in  Botany 
(Arber,  1950;  Jean,  1994).  The  branching  (bifurcating)  structure  of  roots,  shoots, 
veins  on  leaves  of  plants,  etc.,  have  similarity  in  form  to  branched  lighting  strokes, 
tributaries of rivers, physiological networks of blood vessels, nerves, etc. (Goldberger 
et  al.,  1990,  2002;  Jean,  1994).  Such  seemingly  complex  network  structure  is 
associated  with  exquisitely  ordered  beautiful  patterns  exhibited  in  flowers  and 
arrangement  of  leaves  in  the  plant  kingdom  (Jean,  1994).  The  botanical  elements 
which  constitute  plants,  such  as  branches,  leaves,  petals,  florets,  etc,  begin  their 
existence  as  primordia  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  undifferentiated  shoot  apex 
(extremity).  Extensive  observations  in  botany  show  that in  more  than  90%  of  plants 
studied worldwide (Jean, 1994; Stewart, 1995) primordia emerge as protuberances at 
locations  such  that  the  angle    subtended  at  the  apical  center  by  two  successive 

 

3 

primordia is equal to the golden angle f=2p/t2 corresponding to approximately 137.5(cid:176) 
where  t  is  the  golden  mean  (1+(cid:214)5)/2  (cid:1)  1.618.  The  surprisingly  precise  geometrical 
placement  of  plant  primordia  results  in  the  observed  'phyllotactic  patterns',  namely, 
the familiar spiral patterns found in the arrangement of leaves on a stem, in florets of 
composite flowers, the pattern of scales on pineapple and pine cone, etc.  

A general systems theory for fractal fluctuations (Selvam, 1990, 1998; Selvam and 
Fadnavis 1998) summarized in Section 2 shows mathematically that the golden mean 
underlies fractal fluctuations. 

1.2 Mathematical models for fractal fluctuations and deterministic chaos 
The  larger  scale  fluctuations  incorporate  the  smaller  scale  fluctuations  as  internal  fine 
scale  structure  and  may  be  visualized  as  a  continuum  of  eddies  (waves).  Dynamical 
systems  in  nature  are  basically  fuzzy  logic  systems  integrating  a  unified  whole 
communicating network of input signals (perturbations) with self-organized ordered two-
way information transport between the larger and smaller scales. The resulting irregular 
fractal fluctuations are unpredictable. It has not been possible to formulate closed set of 
governing  equations,  i.  e.,  simple  mathematical  equations  with  algebraic  solutions  to 
model  and  predict  the  fractal  fluctuations  of  dynamical  systems.  Self-similar  structures 
are generated by iteration (repetition) of simple rules for growth processes on all scales of 
space  and  time.  Such  iterative  processes  are  simulated  mathematically  by  numerical 
computations such as Xn+1 = F(Xn) where Xn+1, the value of the variable X at (n+1)th 
computational  step  is  a  function  F  of  its  earlier  value  Xn.  Mathematical  models  of  real 
iterative  computational  schemes 
world  dynamical  systems  are  basically  such 
implemented  on  finite  precision  digital  computers.  Computer  precision  imposes  a  limit 
(finite precision) on the accuracy (number of decimals) for numerical representation of X. 
Since X is a real number (infinite number of decimals) finite precision introduces round-
off error in iterative computations from the first stage of computation. The model iterative 
dynamical  system  therefore  incorporates  round-off  error  growth  (Selvam,  1993).  The 
computed  solutions  are  sensitively  dependent  on  initial  conditions,  a  signature  of 
deterministic  chaos,  so  named  since  deterministic  mathematical  equations  result  in 
chaotic solutions. The computed chaotic growth patterns also exhibit self-similar fractal 
structure.  Therefore,  realistic  simulation  and  prediction  of  space-time  fluctuations  of 
dynamical  systems  requires  alternative  concepts  for  physical  laws  and  formulation  of 
governing equations with algebraic solutions.  

A  recently  proposed  general  systems  theory  attributes  quantum-like  chaos  to  the 
observed  long-range  correlations  of  fractal  fluctuations.  The  model  predicts:  (a)  the 
universal inverse power law form of the statistical normal distribution for the power 
spectra  of  fractal  fluctuations  (b)  observed  fractal  fluctuations  result  from  the 
superimposition  of  component  eddies  (c)  identification  of  dominant  periodicities  in 
long-term historical data may help prediction of major cyclical changes in fluctuations 
in  the  near  future.  In  the  present  study  100  years  normalized  monthly  mean  Dow 
Jones  index  was  subjected  to  continuous  periodogram  power  spectral  analyses.  The 
power  spectrum  follows  universal  inverse  power  law  form  of  the  statistical  normal 
distribution  consistent  with  model  prediction.  There  is  good  agreement  between 
observed and predicted times of occurrences of maxima and minima estimated from 
dominant periodicities identified from the 100 years historical data set.  

In the following, Section 2 gives a brief summary of the General Systems Theory 
with applications to prediction; Section 3 presents details of Dow Jones Index data set

used for the study and analyses techniques; Section 4 contains results and discussion 
and Section 5 gives conclusions. 

2. Model concepts 

A general systems theory was first developed to quantify the observed fractal space-
time fluctuations in turbulent fluid flows. The model is based on Townsend’s concept 
(Townsend, 1956) that large eddy structures form in turbulent flows as envelopes of 
enclosed turbulent eddies. The model concepts are independent of the exact details of 
the  physical,  chemical  or  other  properties  and  therefore  applicable  to  all  dynamical 
systems.  The  observed  inverse  power  law  form  for  power  spectra  implies  that  the 
fractal  fluctuations  can  be  visualized  to  result  from  a  hierarchical  eddy  continuum 
structure  for  the  overall  pattern.  Starting  from  this  simple  basic  concept  that  large 
scale eddies form as envelopes of internal small scale eddy circulations the following 
important model predictions are derived. 

2.1 Quantumlike chaos in dynamical systems 

Since  the  large  scale  is  but  the  integrated  mean  of  enclosed  smaller  scales,  eddy 
energy  spectrum  follows  statistical  normal  distribution  according  to  Central  Limit 
Theorem  (Ruhla,  1992).  Such  a  result  that  the  additive  amplitudes  of  eddies,  when 
squared (variance), represents the probability densities, is observed in the subatomic 
dynamics of quantum systems such as the electron or photon (Rae and Harring, 1994, 
Maddox,  1993;  Chown,  2004).  The  power  spectra  of  fractal  fluctuations  therefore 
exhibit quantum-like chaos. The unified communicating network of fluctuations on all 
scales  represents  a  quantum  system  which  responds  as  a  unified  whole  to  local 
perturbation,  also  termed  non-local  connection  or  action  at  a  distance.  The  quantum 
system exhibits long-term memory of short-term fluctuations. 

2.2 Dynamic memory (information) circulation network 
The  root  mean  square  (r.  m.  s.)  circulation  speeds  W  and  w*  of  large  and  turbulent 
eddies of respective radii R and r are related as

(1) 

Equation (1) is a statement of the law of conservation of energy for eddy growth and 
implies  a  two-way  ordered  energy  flow  between  the  larger  and  smaller  scales. 
Microscopic  scale  perturbations  are  carried  permanently  as  internal  circulations  of 
progressively  larger  eddies.  Fractal  fluctuations  therefore  act  as  dynamic  memory 
circulation networks with intrinsic long-term memory of short-term fluctuations. 

Many complex systems in nature can be described in terms of networks capturing 
the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of. The key question 
is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the structural subunits, 
(such  as  functionally  related  proteins,  industrial  sectors  and  groups  of  people) 
associated with more highly interconnected parts ( Palla et al., 2005).

2.3 Quasicrystalline structure 

 
The  flow  structure  consists  of  an 
spiral 
logarithmic 
overall 
trajectory  with  Fibonacci  winding 
number and quasiperiodic Penrose 
tiling  pattern  for 
internal 
the

larger  circulations 
successively 
OR1R2,  OR2R3,  OR3R4,  OR4R5, 
etc., such that the successive radii 
form  the  Fibonacci  mathematical 
number  series,  i.  e.,  OR1/ORO= 
OR2/OR1  =  …….=  t  where  t  is 
to 
the  golden  mean 
(1+(cid:2)5)/2(cid:1)1.618. 
flow 
structure  therefore  consists  of  a 
nested continuum of vortices, i. e., 
vortices within vortices.

The dominant quasi-periodicities are equal to 2.2 Ts, 3.6 Ts, 5.8 Ts, 9.5 Ts, 15.3 Ts, 
24.8 Ts, 40.1 Ts, 64.9 Ts, 105.0 Ts, 167.0 Ts, 275 Ts, 445.0 Ts ……for values of n = -1, 
0,  1,  2,  up  to  10  respectively  (Equation  2).  Space-time  integration  of  turbulent 
fluctuations results in robust broadband dominant periodicities (wavelengths), which 
are functions of the primary perturbation time period Ts alone and are independent of 
exact  details  (chemical,  electrical,  physical  etc.)  of  turbulent  (chaotic)  fluctuations. 
Also, such global scale oscillations in the unified network are not affected appreciably 
by failure of localized micro-scale circulation networks. 

Wavelengths  (or  periodicities)  close  to  the  model  predicted  values  have  been 
reported  in  weather  and  climate  variability  (Selvam  and  Fadnavis,  1998),  daily 
incidence  of  acute  myocardial  infarction  (Selvam  et  al.,  2000),  prime  number 
distribution  (Selvam,  2001a),  Riemann  zeta  zeros  (non-trivial)  distribution  (Selvam, 
2001b),  Drosophila  DNA  base  sequence  (Selvam,  2002),  stock  market  economics 
(Selvam, 2003), Human chromosome 1 DNA base sequence (Selvam, 2004). 

Similar  unified  communication  networks  may  be  involved  in  biological  and 
physiological systems such as the brain and heart, which continue to perform overall 
functions  satisfactorily  in  spite  of  localized  physical  damage.  Structurally  stable 
network  configurations  increase  insensitivity  to  parameter  changes,  noise  and  minor 
mutations (Kitano, 2002).

2.5 Universal spectrum of fluctuations 
Conventional  power  spectral  analysis  will  resolve  such  a  logarithmic  spiral  flow 
trajectory as a continuum of eddies (broadband spectrum) with a progressive increase 
in phase angle. 

The power spectrum, plotted on log-log scale as variance versus frequency (period) 
will represent the probability density corresponding to normalized standard deviation t 
equal to (logL/logT50) –1 where L is the period in units of time (month in the present 
study)  and  T50  is  the  period  up  to  which  the  cumulative  percentage  contribution  to 
total variance is equal to 50. The above expression for normalized standard deviation t 
follows from model prediction of logarithmic spiral flow structure and model concept 
of  successive  growth  structures  by  space-time  averaging.  Fluctuations  of  all  scales 
therefore self-organize to form the universal inverse power law form of the statistical 
normal distribution.  

t  corresponding 

The  normalized  standard  deviation  values 

to  cumulative 
percentage  probability  density  P  equal  to  50  is  equal  to  0  from  statistical  normal 
distribution characteristics. Since t represents the eddy growth step n (Equation 2) the 
dominant  period  (or  length  scale)  T50  up  to  which  the  cumulative  percentage 
contribution  to  total  variance  is  equal  to  50  is  obtained  from  Equation  2  for 
corresponding  value  of  n  equal  to  0.  In  the  present  study  of  fractal  fluctuations  of 
Dow  Jones  Index,  the  primary  perturbation  length  scale  Ts  is  equal  to  unit  time 
interval (one month in the present study) and T50 is obtained as

3. Applications of the general systems theory concepts to Dow Jones 

Index time series 

The  following  model  predictions  for  dynamical systems  in  general  are  applicable  to 
the  apparently  irregular  (unpredictable) fluctuations  of  Dow  Jones  Index  time  series 
and may help quantify the overall pattern and also predict times of major maxima and 
minima: (i) power spectra of fractal fluctuations generic to dynamical systems exhibit 
the universal inverse power law form of the statistical normal distribution (ii) fractal 
fluctuations  may  be  resolved  into  an  overall  logarithmic  spiral  trajectory  with  the 
quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern for the internal structure (figure 1) (iii) continuous 
periodogram  power  spectral  analysis  therefore  exhibits  an  eddy  continuum  with 
embedded dominant wavebands whose peak periodicities are functions of the golden 
mean  and  the  primary  perturbation  time  period  (Equation  2).  Peak  amplitudes  and 
phases of the statistically significant dominant eddies obtained from the periodogram 
analysis may help estimate the times of occurrence of maxima and minima in the near 
future. 

4. Data and Analysis 

Dow Jones Index values were obtained from Dow Jones Industrial Average History File, 
Dow  Jones  closing  prices  starting  in  1900:  3  Jan  1900  to  9  November  2005  (28889 
trading  days).  Data  from:  Department  of  Statistics  at  Carnegie  Mellon  Univ.,

The  normalized  day-  to-  day  changes  in  the  Dow  Jones  Index  values  were 
computed  as  percentages  of  the  earlier  day  value.  Monthly  mean  values  were  then 
computed from the normalized day- to- day changes in the Dow Jones Index. A total 
of  1266  monthly  mean  values  were  used  for  the  study.  Continuous  periodogram 
power  spectral  analysis  of  the  first  1200  (January  1900  -  April  2000)  values  shows 
that  the  power  spectrum  follows  the  universal  inverse  power  law  form  of  the 
statistical  normal  distribution.  Dominant  peak  periodicities  identified  from  the 
periodogram analysis were used to estimate the Dow Jones Index values for months 
1201 (May 2000) to 1266 (Oct 2005). 

4.1 Continuous periodogram power spectral analyses 
The broadband power spectrum of space-time fluctuations of dynamical systems can 
be  computed  accurately  by  an  elementary,  but  very  powerful  method  of  analysis 
developed  by  Jenkinson  (1977)  which  provides  a  quasi-continuous  form  of  the 
classical periodogram allowing systematic allocation of the total variance and degrees 
of  freedom  of  the  data  series  to  logarithmically  spaced  elements  of  the  frequency 
range  (0.5,  0).  The  periodogram  is  constructed  for  a  fixed  set  of  10000  (m) 
periodicities  Lm  which  increase  geometrically  as  Lm=2  exp  (Cm)  where  C=.001  and 
m=0, 1, 2,....9999. The data series Ys for the N data points was used. The periodogram 
estimates  the  set  of  Amcos(2pfmS-fm)  where  Am,  fm  and  fm  denote  respectively  the 
amplitude, frequency and phase angle for the mth periodicity and S is the time interval 
in days, months or years. Since the frequency band 0 to 0.5 accounts for N degrees of 
freedom, then nm, the degree of freedom for the mth wavelength, is given by

The  cumulative  percentage  contribution  to  total  variance  and  the  corresponding  t 
values  were  computed.  The  power  spectra  were  plotted  as  cumulative  percentage 
contribution  to  total  variance  versus  the  normalized  standard  deviation  t  as  given 
above. The period L is in time interval units (months). The statistical chi-square test 
(Spiegel, 1961) was applied to determine the ‘goodness of fit’ of variance spectra with 
statistical normal distribution.

This  will  always  give  the  mean  value,  or  zero,  since  differences  from  the  mean 
have been used. But if summation is done for values of normalized variance H ‡ Hc, 
the  significant  part  of  the  spectrum  should  remain.  If  Hc  = 1,  more  than 70%  of  the 

variance is accounted for, and by summing 

smmYn

 for H ‡ 1, a good fit to the data 

months is obtained while retaining the major significant waves in the forecast months.

5. Results and Discussion 

The  first  1200  out  of  the  available  1266  values  of  monthly  mean  normalized  Dow 
Jones  Index  (Section  4)  was  subjected  to  continuous  periodogram  power  spectral 
analysis  (Jenkinson,  1977).  The  power  spectrum,  plotted  as  cumulative  percentage 
contribution  to  total  variance  versus  normalized  standard  deviation  t  is  shown  at 
figure  2  along  with  the  statistical  normal  distribution  and  T50  value.  The  power 
spectrum  follows  the  model  predicted  universal  inverse  power  law  form  of  the 
statistical  normal  distribution,  the  ‘goodness  of  fit’  being  significant  (statistical  c2 
test)  at  less  than  5%  level.  The  value  of  T50,  the  period  up  to  which  the  cumulative 
percentage contribution to total variance is equal to 50, is 4.38 months close to model 
predicted value of 3.62.  

Figure 2 

 

The  number  of  dominant  eddies  with  normalized  variance  H  ‡  1  (see  Section  4.2 
above) is 199 out of which 24 are significant as determined by statistical c2 test (see 
Section 4.1 above). The peak amplitude (Ap), the corresponding frequency (fp), phase 
angle (fp) and significance (sg) for each of the 199 dominant eddies are listed in Table 
1.

There are 24 significant peak periodicities marked as * under column ‘sg’ in Table 
1 and they correspond closely to model predicted dominant periodicities (Section 2.4, 
Equation 2). Spectral projection was done using all the 199 dominant eddies and also 
the  24  significant  dominant  eddies.  The  computed  time  series  of  1266  normalized 
monthly mean Dow Jones Index values (January 1900 – October 2005) are shown in 
figure  3  along  with  the  actual  values  for  the  years  2000  to  2005  and  also  for  the 

 

12 

historic  years  of  major  stock  market  crash  during  1929  and  1987.  The  symbol  D  in 
figure  3  denotes  the  actual  Dow  Jones  Index  while  the  symbols  A  and  S  denote 
respectively spectral projections using all the dominant eddies and significant eddies. 
The  times  of occurrence  of  maxima  and  minima  in  Dow  Jones  Index  values  for  the 
years 2000 to 2005 are in good agreement with the spectral projection.

From  a  wide  range  of  aggregate  data,  Chen  (1996a)  reports  the  existence  of 
persistent  cycles,  in  addition  to  color  noise.  Spectral  analysis  not  only  provides 
complementary evidence of “co-movements” of business, but also reveals distinctive 
patterns of frequency evolution. It is found that characteristic frequencies of business 
indicators  are  remarkably  stable.  Existence  of  stable  characteristic  frequencies  from 
economic  aggregates  provides  strong  evidence  of  endogenous  cycles  and  valuable 
information  about  structural  changes.  Economic  behavior  is  more  like  an  organism 
instead of random walks. Remarkable stability and resilience of market economy can 
be seen from the insignificance of the oil price shocks and the stock market crash. An 
alternative  title  for  econometric  literature  could  be:  "Business  cycle  measurement 
without model specification". Chen (1996a) states that the most enlightening result in 
business cycle studies is the discovery of persistent cycles, i. e., self-generating cycles 
from  economic  aggregates.  These  cycles  are  nonlinear  in  nature  with  remarkable 
resilience and flexibility like living beings. This discovery provides a new perspective 
to  business  cycles.  Traditionally,  the  economic  order  is  characterized  by  negative 
feedback and equilibrium (steady) states. The new role of persistent cycles challenges 
the linear framework of economic dynamics. We need to re-examine the implications 
of complexity and instability in business cycles. The characteristic period of persistent 
cycles is around three to four years. The existence of persistent chaotic cycles reveals 
a  new  perspective  of  market  resilience  and  new  sources  of  economic  uncertainties 
Chen (1996b).

where  npk  is  the  number  of  peak  periodicities  equal  to  199  for  all  dominant 
periodicities  and  equal  to  24  for  significant  periodicities.  The  computed  data  series 
Ytime gives 1266 values for time = 1, 2, 3, …..1266. Spectral projection of near future 
fluctuations using dominant periodicities determined from historical (past) data series 
(1 to 1200 months in this study) is based on theory and model prediction (Equation 2) 
that  dominant  periodicities  are  functions  of  the  golden  mean  and  the  time  unit  of 
measurement only and therefore remain the same for projection of the monthly mean 
data extending beyond 1200 months, e. g., up to 1266 months in the present study. 

There is close agreement between historical and computed Dow Jones Index values 
for the first 1200 values which were used for the spectral analysis and thereafter there 
is  reasonable  agreement  between  the  predicted  and  observed  times  of  occurrence  of 
maxima and minima (figure 3).  

Conclusion 

The aggregate stock market activity as quantified in the Dow Jones Index exhibits 
fractal  fluctuations  on  all  time  scales  from  days,  months  to  years.  Model  predicted 
semi-permanent dominant periodicities were identified from continuous periodogram 
spectral  analysis  of  available  monthly  mean  historic  data  set  from  January  1900  - 
April  2000.  These  dominant  periodicities  were  then  used  for  spectral  projection  of 
fluctuation  pattern  for  the  period  May  2000  to  October  2005.  The  predicted  and 
observed times of maxima and minima in Dow Jones Index were in close agreement 
(figure 3).

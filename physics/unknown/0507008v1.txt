Here  I  design  an  experimental  way  of  a  quantum  communication  by  quantum  CNOT  gates  and 

single  qubit  gates  without  the  help  of  classical  communication.  Another  conclusion  is  that  GHZ

In  recent  years,  the  designs  of  quantum  communication,  for  example  in  Ref.  [1-6], 

include classical communication because of no-cloning theorem [7].   

For our purpose, it is enough for a quantum gate to clone anyone state of two orthogonal 

states |0> and 1>，that is, if the being copied state is |0>, the two outputs get two states |0>, 

and  if  the  being  copied  state  is  |1>,  the  two  outputs  get  two  states  |1>  by  the  same  gate. 

No-cloning  theorem  does  not  prohibit  this  type  cloning.  A  quantum  circuit  [3]  has  been 

designed  for  doing  this  type  cloning.  Quantum  Toffoli  gate  is  also  suit  for  this  thing.  The 

simplest gate for this application is quantum CNOT gate. The target qubit inputs state |0> and 

the control qubit inputs state|0> or|1>, then two outputs get two states |0> or two states |1>. 

Now I show an experimental way for this quantum communication. Alice and Bob are far 

from each other, they share an EPR [8] pair |ψ>= (|00>+|11>)∕ 2 . Alice wants to send a 

bit  classical  information  to  Bob,  she  can  select  one  measurement  in  one  of  the  two 

computational bases [3]: {|0>, |1>}, or {(|0>+|1>)∕ 2 , (|0>-|1>)∕ 2 }, then Bob uses 

quantum  CNOT  gate  to  copy  his  qubit  and  measures  his  qubits  only in the projection on the 

state |0>. If Alice uses the first base, then Bob’s qubit will be in |0> or |1> instantaneously. 

Bob can definitely clone his qubit using a quantum CNOT gate, No matter what state (|0> or 

|1>) is Bob’s qubit. If Alice uses the other base, then Bob’s qubit will be in (|0>+|1>)∕ 2  

or (|0>-|1>)∕ 2   instantaneously. Bob still uses the gate to “copy” his qubit. But this time, 

he  cannot  get  same  copies,  but  he  can  get  entangled  state    (|00>+|11>) ∕ 2   or 

(|00>-|11>)∕ 2 . 

To  distinguish  Bob’s  two  set  states  {|0>,  |1>}  and  {(|0>+|1>)∕ 2 ,  (|0>-|1>)∕

2 }, using only one quantum CNOT gate is not enough. Bob can use n-1 quantum CNOT gates 

or a quantum CNOT gate with n-1 target qubits to get one result of four cases:    {|0>(n), |1>(n); 

(|0>(n)+|1>(n))∕ 2 , (|0>(n)-|1>(n))∕ 2 , the first two states are n qubit product states and 

the last two states are n qubit GHZ [9] states.   

Next step is pivotal. Bob knows that he has to do same things to distinguish product states 

and GHZ states according to his measurement results. Bob uses a single qubit gate U(1)(θ) to 

rotate his first qubit in θ (0<θ<π/8) [3,10] and gets:   

U(1)(θ) |0>(n) =( cosθ|0>+sinθ|1>)|0>(n-1)      ,                                              (1) 

U(1)(θ) |1>(n) =(-sinθ|0>+cosθ|1>)|1>(n-1)    ,                                                (2) 

U(1)(θ) (|0>(n) + |1>(n) )/ 2   =[|0>(cosθ|0>(n-1) - sinθ |1>(n-1) )+ 

  |1>(sinθ|0>(n-1) + cosθ |1>(n-1) )    ] / 2 ,              (3) 

U(1)(θ) (|0>(n) - |1>(n) )/ 2 } =[|0>(cosθ|0>(n-1) + sinθ |1>(n-1) )+   

|1>(sinθ|0>(n-1) - cosθ |1>(n-1) )    ] / 2 .              (4) 

From  Eq.  (3),  (4),  we  can  get  a  conclusion  that  GHZ  state  is  not  fully  fragile,  as  we  can 

maintain n-1 qubit entanglement of n qubit GHZ state after having measured one of n qubits. 

Then  Bob  measures  the  projection  of  his  first  qubit  only  on  state  |0>  and  he  can  get  four 

different probabilities: 

p11=cos2θ,    p21=sin2θ,    p31=p41=1/2.                                                              (5) 

Again Bob does same things on his second qubit and easily gets probabilities of state |0> in 

the case of product states:   

p12=cos2θ,    p22=sin2θ .                                                                                    (6) 

When Bob’s GHZ state is initially in (|0>(n) + |1>(n) )/ 2   , he can get: 

U(2)(θ)  (cosθ|0>(n-1)  -  sinθ  |1>(n-1)  )=  (cos4θ+sin4θ)1/2|0>  [(cos4θ+sin4θ)-1/2  (cos2θ|0>(n-2) 

+sin2θ |1>(n-2) )]+ 

2 sinθcosθ |1> (|0>(n-2) - |1>(n-2) )/ 2 ,                          (7)   

if the measurement result of Bob’s first qubit is in |0>; and   

U(2)(θ)  (sinθ|0>(n-1)  +  cosθ|1>(n-1)  )=

2 sinθcosθ 

|0>  (|0>(n-2)  - 

|1>(n-2)  )/

2 + 

(cos4θ+sin4θ)1/2|1>[(cos4θ+sin4θ)-1/2 (sin2θ|0>(n-2) +cos2θ |1>(n-2) )],                  (8) 

if  the  measurement  result  of  Bob’s  first  qubit  is  not  in  |0>.  In  this  case,  Bob  can  get  the 

probabilities of |0>:   

p32= cos4θ+sin4θ ,    p’32= 2sin2θcos2θ .                                                      (9) 

When Bob’s GHZ state is initially in (|0>(n) - |1>(n) )/ 2   , he can get the probabilities same 

as (9)   

                p42= p32 , p’42= p’32.       

After  Bob  measures  his  second  qubit,  he  gets  one  of  four  different  numbers,  2(cos2θ), 

2(sin2θ),  1+(cos4θ+sin4θ),  0+2sin2θcos2θ,  of  his  first  two  qubits  in  |0>.  Although  Bob  is 

difficult to distinguish the product states and GHZ states only using his first two qubits, he 

can  use  his  n  qubits  to  do  same  things.  The  calculations  for  the  numbers  of  n  qubit  GHZ 

states will be very tedious. We can expect that these numbers of n qubit GHZ states different 

from n(cos2θ) and n(sin2θ) in calculations by properly selecting θ and n, that is if the number 

from Bob’s measurement result tends to n(cos2θ) or n(sin2θ), he can identify that his n qubits 

are in product state, otherwise in GHZ state. Finally, Bob can get a bit classical information 

from  Alice.  In  this  way,  Alice  and  Bob  can  do  this  quantum  communication  bypassing  the 

barrier of no-cloning theorem and not using classical communication. 

Five-photon  GHZ  state  has  been  implemented  in  the  experiment  [11].  In  this  letter,  if 

Bob uses 4 quantum CNOT gates, he can prepare 5 qubit product states or 5 qubit GHZ states 

and select proper θ to satisfy sin2θ = 1/5, cos2θ =4/5. Therefore, we can think that if Bob gets   

one  or  four  of  his  qubits  in  |0>,  he  can  judge  his  n  qubits  in  product  state,  that  is 

corresponding to the measurement made by Alice in the base {|0>, |1>}; otherwise he can 

judge other result. 

Some  technical  problems  may  be  easily  solved.  For  example,  if  it  is  not  credible  that 

Alice and Bob use one EPR pair to send a bit classical information, they can use several EPR pairs 

to  send  a  bit  classical  information.  Other  one  is  that  Bob  cannot  distinguish  the  two  cases:  no 

measurement and the measurement in base (|0>+|1>)∕ 2   and (|0>-|1>)∕ 2   by Alice. 

One method is to let Alice and Bob to measure definite EPR pairs according to definite time 

order.  Other  method  is  that,  if  the  first  and  last  EPR  pairs  in  a  group  are  measured  in  base 

{|0>,  |1>},  then  there  is  no  need  of  measurement  in  base  {(|0>+|1>)∕ 2 ,  (|0>-|1>)∕

2 } by Alice, since the two cases are same for Bob in the sense that he can get same results 

of the probabilities. 

Two  other  promising  experimental  ways  may  be  the  uses  of  probabilistic  quantum 

cloning  machine  [12]  and  quantum  non-demolition  measurement  [13,14].  These  ways  may 

bypass no-cloning theorem to implement this quantum communication. 

      In summary, I design an experimental way of this quantum communication by quantum 

CNOT gates and single qubit gates and show how we bypass the barrier of no-cloning theorem. 

This way is a pure quantum communication without the help of classical communication. It is 

expected that this way will be proved by experiments and further calculations, and other ways 

will be designed.

Abstract 
 
The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  compare  statistical  properties  of  stock  price  indices  in  periods  of 
booms with those in periods of stagnations. We use the daily data of the four stock price indices 
in the major stock markets in the world: (i) the Nikkei 225 index (Nikkei 225) from January 4, 
1975 to August 18, 2004, of (ii) the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from January 2, 1946 
to August 18, 2004, of (iii) Standard and Poor’s 500 index (SP500) from November 22, 1982 to 
August  18,  2004,  and  of  (iii)  the  Financial  Times  Stock  Exchange  100  index  (FT  100)  from 
April 2, 1984 to August 18, 2004. We divide the time series of each of these indices in the two 
periods: booms and stagnations, and investigate the statistical properties of absolute log returns, 
which  is  a  typical  measure  of  volatility,  for  each  period.  We  find  that  (i)  the  tail  of  the 
distribution  of  the  absolute  log-returns  is  approximated  by  a  power-law  function  with  the 
exponent close to 3 in the periods of booms while the distribution is described by an exponential 
function with the scale parameter close to unity in the periods of stagnations.   
 
1.  Introduction   
 
The  statistical  properties  of  the  fluctuations  of  financial  prices  have  been  widely 
researched  since  Mandelbrot  (1963)  and  Fama  (1965)  presented  evidence  that  return 
distributions can be well described by a symmetric Levy stable law with tail index close 
to 1.7. In particular, a large number of empirical studies have shown that the tails of the 
distributions of returns and volatility follow approximately a power law with estimates 
of the tail index falling in the range 2 to 4 for large value of returns and volatility. (See, 
for examples, de Vries (1994); Pagan (1996); Longin (1996), Lux (1996); Guillaume et al. 
(1997);  Muller  et  al.  (1998);  Gopikrishnan  et  al.  (1998),  Gopikrishnan  et  al.  (1999), 
Plerou  et  al.  (1999),  Liu  et  al.  (1999)).  However,  there  is  evidence  against  power-law 
tails  too.  For  instance,  Barndorff-Nielsen  (1997),  Eberlein  et  al.  (1998)  have 
respectively  fitted  the  distributions  of  returns  using  normal  inverse  Gaussian,  and 
hyperbolic  distribution.  Laherrere  and  Sornette  (1999)  have  suggested  to  describe  the 
distributions  of  returns  by  the  Stretched-Exponential  distribution.    Dragulescu  and 
Yakovenko (2002), and Kaizoji and Kaizoji (2003) have shown that the distributions of 
returns  have  been  approximated  by  exponential  distributions.  More  recently, 
Malevergne,  Pisarenko  and  Sornette  (2004)  have  suggested  that  the  tails  ultimately

decay slower than any stretched exponential distribution but probably faster than power 
laws with reasonable exponents as a result from various statistical tests of returns.   

Thus opinions vary among scientists as to the shape of the tail of the distribution of 
returns (and volatility). While there is fairly general agreement that the distribution of 
returns and volatility has power-like tail for large values of returns and volatility, there 
is  still  room  for  a  considerable  measure  of  disagreement  about  the  hypothesis.  At  the 
moment we can only say with fair certainty that (i) the power-law tail of the distribution 
of  returns  and  volatility  is  not  an  universal  law  and  (ii)  the  tails  of  the  distribution  of 
returns  and  volatility  are  heavier  than  a  Gaussian,  and  are  between  power-law  and 
exponential.   

There  is  one  other  thing  that  is  important  for  understanding  of  price  movements  in 
financial  markets.  It  is  a  fact  that  the  financial  market  has  repeated  booms  (or  bull 
market) and stagnations (or bear market). To ignore this fact is to miss the reason why 
price  fluctuations  are  caused.  This  is  an  important  fact  to  stress.  However,  in  a  large 
number of empirical studies, which have been made on statistical properties of returns 
and  volatility  in  financial  markets,  little  attention  has  been  given  to  the  relationship 
between  market  situations  and  price  fluctuations.  Kaizoji  (2004a)  investigates  this 
subject using the historical data of the Nikkei 225 index. We found that the shape of the 
volatility  distribution  in  the  period  of  booms  was  different  from  that  in  the  period  of 
stagnations. The purpose of this paper is to examine further the statistical properties of 
volatility distribution from this viewpoint. We use the daily data of the four stock price 
indices of the three major stock markets in the world: the Nikkei 225 index, the DJIA. 
SP500, and FT100, and compare the shape of the volatility distribution for each of the 
stock  price  indices  in  the  periods  of  booms  with  that  in  the  period  of  stagnations.  We 
find that (i) the tail of the distribution of the absolute log-returns is approximated by a 
power-law  function  with  the  exponent  close  to  3  in  the  periods  of  booms  while  the 
distribution  is  described  by  an  exponential  function  with  the  scale  parameter  close  to 
unity in the periods of stagnations. These indicate that so far as the stock price indices 
we used are concerned, the same observation on the volatility  distribution holds in all 
cases.   

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section analyzes the stock price 

indices and shows the empirical findings. Section 3 gives concluding remarks.   
 
2.    Empirical analysis 
 
2.1. Stock Price Indices 
 
We  investigate  quantitatively  the  four  stock  price  indices1of  the  three  major  stock 
markets  in  the  world,  that  is,  (a)  the  Nikkei  225  index  (Nikkei  225),  which  is  the 
price-weighted average of the stock prices for 225 large companies listed in the Tokyo 
Stock  Exchange,  (b)  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average  (DJIA)  which  is  the 
price-weighted average of 30 significant stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange 
and  Nasdaq,  (c)  Standard  and  Proor’s  500  index  (SP  500)  which  is  a  market-value 
weighted  index  of  500  stocks  chosen  for  market  size,  liquidity,  and  industry  group 
representation, and (d) FT 100, which is similar to SP 500, and a market-value weighted

1(a)-(d)  show  the  daily  series  of  the  four stock price indices: (a) the  Nikkei 225 from 
January 4, 1975 to August 18, 2004, (b) DJIA from January 2, 1946 to August 18, 2004, 
(c)  SP  500  from  November  22,  1982  to August  18,  2004,  and  (d)  FT  100  from April  2, 
1984 to August 18, 2004.   

After booms of a long period of time, the Nikkei 225 reached a high of almost 40,000 
yen  on  the  last  trading  day  of  the  decade  of  the  1980s,  and  then  from  the  beginning 
trading  day  of  1990  to  mid-August  1992,  the  index  had  declined  to  14,309,  a  drop  of 
about 63 percent. A prolonged stagnation of the Japanese stock market started from the 
beginning of 1990.   

The  time  series  of  the  DJIA  and  SP500  had  the  apparent  positive  trends  until  the 
beginning  of  2000.  Particularly  these  indices  surged  from  the  mid-1990s.  There  is  no 
doubt that this stock market booms in history were propelled by the phenomenal growth 
of  the  Internet  which  has  added  a  whole  new  stratum  of  industry  to  the  American 
economy.  However,  the  stock  market  booms  in  the  US  stock  markets  collapsed  at  the 
beginning  of  2000,  and  the  descent  of  the  US  markets  started.  The  DJIA  peaked  at 
11722.98  on  January  14,  2000,  and  dropped  to  7286.27  on  October  9,  2002  by  38 
percent. SP500 arrived at peak for 1527.46 on March 24, 2000 and hit the bottom for 
776.76 on October 10, 2002. SP500 dropped by 50 percent. Similarly FT100 reached a 
high  of  6930.2  on  December  30,  2000  and  the  descent  started  from  the  time.  FT100 
dropped to 3287 on March 12, 2003 by 53 percent.

From these observations we divide the time series of these indices in the two periods 
on the day of the highest value. We define the period a period until it reaches the highest 
value as the period of booms and the period after that as stagnations, respectively. The 
periods of booms and stagnations for each index of the four indices are collected into

2.2. Comparisons of the distributions of absolute log returns 
 
In  this  paper  we  investigate  the  shape  of  distributions  of  absolute  log  returns  of  the 
stock price indices. We concentrate to compare the shape of the distribution of volatility 
in the period of booms with that in the period of stagnations. We use absolute log return, 
which is a typical measure of volatility. The absolute log returns is defined as |R(t)| = |ln 
S(t) - ln S(t-1)|, where S(t) denotes the index at the date t. We normalize the absolute 
log-return |R(t)| using the standard deviation. The normalized absolute log return V(t) is 
defined as V(t) = |R(t)| /σ  whereσ  denotes the standard deviation of |R(t)|.   

Figure 2 (a)-(d) show the semi-log plot of the complementary cumulative distribution 
function of the normalized absolute log-returns V for each of the four stock price indices.

Each panel compares the distribution of V for an index in the period of booms with that 
in the period of stagnations. The circles represent the distribution in the period of booms 
and triangles that in the period of stagnations. In the all panels it follows that the tail of 
the  volatility  distribution  of  V  is  heavier  in  the  period  of  booms  than  in  the  period  of 
stagnations.  We  shall  now  look  more  carefully  into  the  difference  between  the  two 
distributions.  To  this  aim,  we  attempt  to  fit  the  empirical  distributions  with  the  two 
specific distributions, that is, an exponential and power-law function below.   

The  panels  (a)-(h)  of  Figure  3  show  the  semi-log  plots  of  the  complementary 
cumulative distribution of V for each of the four indices: Nikkei225, DJIA, SP500, and 
FT100  in  the  period  of  booms  and  that  in  the  period  of  stagnations,  respectively.  The 
solid lines in all panels represent the fits of the exponential distribution,

In  all  cases  of  the  period  of  stagnations,  which  are  panels  (b),  (d),  (f)  and  (h),  the 
exponential  distribution  (1)  describes  very  well  the  distributions  of  V  over  a  whole 
range of values of V except for only the tow extreme value of V, that is, . In panel (b) the 
Nikkei 225 had one extreme value that occurred on September 28, 1990 in the Japanese 
stock markets and that occurred on September 10, 2001 in US stock markets. The jump 
of Nikkei 225 perhaps was caused by investors’ speculation on the 1990 Gulf War. The 
extreme value of DJIA was caused by terror attack in New York on September 10, 20012. 
The scale parameter β  is estimated from the data except for these two extreme values 
using  a  least  squared  method  is  collected  in  Table  2.  In  all  cases  the  values  of  the 
estimated β  are very close to unity.

On the other hand the panels (a), (c), (e), and (g) of Figure 3 show the complementary 
cumulative distribution of V in the period of booms for each of the four indices in the 
semi-log  plots.  The  solid  lines  in  all  panels  represent  the  fits  of  the  exponential 
distribution estimated from the  data of only  the low values  of V using a least squared 
method. In these cases the low values of V are only approximately well described by the 
exponential  distribution  (1),  but  completely  fails  in  describing  the  large  values  of  V.

originate in a difference between the calculation methods of the DJIA and the SP 500. In 
DJIA Higher-priced stocks affect the average greater than lower-priced ones, while 
regardless of stock price, a percentage change will be reflected the same on the index in 
SP500.

Apparently, an exponential distribution underestimates large values of V.   

The panels (a)-(d) of Figure 4 show the complementary cumulative distribution of V 
in the period of stagnations for each of the four indices in the log-log plots. The solid

The power-law exponentα  is estimated from the data of the large values of V using the

those  in  the  period  of  stagnations  in  a  log-log  scale.  The  two  figures  confirm  that  the 
shape of the fourth volatility distributions in the periods of booms and of stagnations is 
almost the same, respectively.   
 
3.  Concluding remarks 
 

In  this  paper  we  focus  on  comparisons  of  shape  of  the  distributions  of  absolute  log 
returns in the period of booms with those in the period of stagnations for the four major 
stock  price  indices.  We  find  that  the  complementary  cumulative  distribution  in  the 
period  of  booms  is  very  well  described  by  exponential  distribution  with  the  scale 
parameter close to unity while the complementary cumulative distribution in the large 
value  of  the  absolute  log  returns  is  approximated  by  power-law  distribution  with  the 
exponent  in  the  range  of  2.8  to  3.8.  The  latter  is  complete  agreement  with  numerous 
evidences  to  show  that  the  tail  of  the  distribution  of  returns  and  volatility  for  large 
values  of  volatility  follow  approximately  a  power  law  with  the  estimates  of  the 
exponentα  falling  in  the  range  2  to  4.  We  are  now  able  to  see  that  the  statistical 
properties of volatility for stock price index are changed according to situations of the 
stock  markets.  Our  findings  make  it  clear  that  we  must  look  more  carefully  into  the 
relationship between regimes of markets and volatility in order to fully understand price 
fluctuations in financial markets.   

The  question  which  we  must  consider  next  is  the  reasons  why  and  how  the 
differences  are  created.  That  traders’  herd  behavior  may  help  account  for  it  would  be

accepted  by  most  people.  Recently  we  have  proposed  a  stochastic  model  (Kaizoji 
(2004b)) that may offer the key to an understanding of the empirical findings we present 
here. The results of the numerical simulation of the model suggest the following: in the 
period of booms, the noise traders' herd behavior strongly influences to the stock market 
and  generate  power-law  tails  of  the  volatility  distribution  while  in  the  period  of 
stagnations a large number of noise traders leave a stock market and interplay with the 
noise  traders  become  weak,  so  that  exponential  tails  of  the  volatility  distribution  is 
observed. However it remains an unsettled question what causes switching from boom 
to stagnation.   
  Our findings may provide a starting point to make a new tool of risk management of 
index fund in financial markets, but to apply the rule we show here to risk management, 
we  need  to  establish  the  framework  of  analysis  and  refine  the  statistical  methods.  We 
began with a simple observation on the stock price indices, and divided the price series 
into  the  two  periods:  booms  and  stagnations.  However,  there  is  room  for  further 
investigation on how to split the price series into periods according to the situations of 
markets. It is also worth while examining the statistical tools to estimate the tail of the 
volatility  distribution  more  closely  and  comprehensively.  As  Malevergne,  Pisarenko, 
and  Sornette  (2004)  have  suggested,  the  log-Weibull  model,  which  provides  a  smooth 
interpolation  between  exponential  distribution  and  power-law  distribution,  will  be 
considered as an appropriate approximation of the volatility distributions. These studies 
will be left for future work.

period  of  stagnations.  The  dark  blue  circles  denote  the  distributions  in  the  period  of 
booms,  and  the  pink  triangles  the  distribution  in  the  period  of  stagnations.  The 
distributions are shown in a semi-log scale.   
 
Figure  3:  The  panels  (a),  (c),  (e)  and  (g)  indicate  the  complementary  cumulative 
distribution  of  absolute  log  returns  V  for  each  of  the  four  stock  price  indices  in  the 
period  of  booms,  and  the  panels  (b),  (d),  (f)  and  (h)  indicate  that  in  the  period  of 
stagnations. These figures are shown in a semi-log scale. The solid lines represent fits of 
the exponential distribution estimated from the data using a least squared method.   
 
Figure  4:  The  panels  (a),  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  indicate  the  complementary  cumulative 
distribution  of  absolute  log  returns  V  for  each  of  the  four  stock  price  indices  in  the 
period  of  booms  in  a  log-log  scale.  The  solid  lines  represent  the  best  fits  of  the 
exponential  distribution  estimated  from  the  data  in  the  large  value  of  V  using  a  least 
squared method.   
 
Figure 5: The panels (a) and (b) show the complementary cumulative distributions of V 
for the four indices in the period of booms in a semi-log scale, and those in the period of 
stagnations in a log-log scale.

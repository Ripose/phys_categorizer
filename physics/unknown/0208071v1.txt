We demonstrate three-dimensional (3-D) quenched narrow-line laser cooling and trapping

of  40Ca.  With 5 ms of cooling time we can transfer 28 % of the  atoms from a magneto-

optic trap based on the strong 423 nm cooling line to a trap based on the narrow 657 nm

clock transition (that is quenched by an intercombination line at 552 nm), thereby reducing

the atoms’ temperature from 2 mK to 10 (cid:1)K.  This reduction in temperature should  help

reduce the overall systematic frequency uncertainty for our Ca optical frequency standard

to < 1 Hz.  Additional pulsed, quenched narrow-line third-stage cooling in 1-D yields sub-

recoil temperatures as low as 300 nK, and makes possible the observation of high-contrast

two-pulse Ramsey spectroscopic lineshapes.

Introduction

Alkali atoms are routinely laser cooled to temperatures ranging from 1-20 (cid:1)K (corresponding to

several atomic recoils) by the use of optical molasses on strong transitions.  In an effort to further

reduce atom temperatures, investigators developed new methods to push the cooling below the

recoil limit, including the realization  of several new  laser-cooling  strategies: Raman  cooling1,2,

velocity-selective coherent population trapping3, and evaporative cooling in dipole traps4.  Such

second-stage cooling schemes have attained temperatures well below 1 (cid:1)K and have been used

in a variety of experimental demonstrations. 

Second-stage cooling is particularly important for alkaline-earth elements since magneto-

optic  traps  (MOTs)  involving  these  atoms  typically  have  temperatures  of  several  millikelvins.

These  relatively  high  temperatures  are  the  consequence  of  Doppler-limited  cooling  on  strong

transitions that lack the ground-state substructure required for sub-Doppler cooling mechanisms

such as polarization-gradient cooling.  There is however real interest in obtaining colder alkaline-

earth atoms, since this would benefit many applications including atom interferometry, quantum

degenerate gases, and optical frequency standards.  In fact, recent frequency measurements of the

Ca clock transition at 657 nm were limited (at ~10 Hz) primarily by residual Doppler effects due

to the millikelvin temperatures of the laser-cooled atoms.5,6  

In an effort to reduce the temperature of our Ca atoms, we looked to cooling experiments

in Sr, whose narrow intercombination line at 689 nm had been used to build a second-stage MOT

and  achieved  sub-microkelvin  temperatures.7,8    The  corresponding  transition  in  Ca  (400  Hz

linewidth),  while  excellent  for  optical  frequency  standards,  cycles  photons  too  slowly  to  use

directly  for  second-stage  cooling  of  atomic  samples  starting  with  a  temperature  of  several

millikelvins.    However,  by  incorporating  a  technique  first  demonstrated  for  sideband-cooling

2

with trapped ions9, we are able to accelerate the cooling process by quenching the excited state,

that is, connecting the excited state with another laser to a higher-lying level that decays quickly

to the ground state.  We previously used quenched narrow-line laser cooling (QNLC)10 in 1-D to

reduce the atomic temperature to 4 (cid:1)K, thus showing the potential of the technique.  For the Ca

optical  frequency  standard,  however,  full  3-D  cooling  is  required  to  reduce  the  systematic

frequency  shifts.    Quenched  cooling  and  trapping  in  3-D  for  Ca  was  first  demonstrated  at  the

Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), where a quenching transition at 453 nm was used

to achieve temperatures of less than 10 (cid:1)K and transfer efficiencies of ~12 %.11 

Here we describe 3-D second-stage cooling of Ca, in which we use a different quenching

transition  to  achieve  similar  temperatures  but  higher  transfer  efficiency  (~25  %).    These

microkelvin  temperatures  should  enable  the  Ca  optical  frequency  standard/clock  at  657  nm  to

achieve  a  frequency  uncertainty  of  <  1  Hz  (fractionally  <  3(cid:2)10-15).    Additionally,  we  use  this

ultracold  sample  as  a  starting  point  for  third-stage  QNLC  in  1-D;  with  a  step-wise  excitation

scheme based on our earlier work10 we can now produce sub-recoil temperatures as low as 300

nK for 60  %  of  the  ultracold  atoms.    These  sub-microkelvin  atomic  samples  derived  from  our

three-stage cooling scheme are then used for the first demonstration of two-pulse Ramsey fringes

3-D Second-stage Cooling

with Ca atoms.  

Experiment

While the step-wise excitation approach we used for 1-D cooling can be extended to 3-D2, it is

more  straightforward  to  implement  the  method  demonstrated  in  Ref.  11  for  3-D  cooling  and

trapping.    This  approach  uses  simultaneous  rather  than  sequential  excitation  of  the  three-level

3

system  (clock  +  quenching  transitions).    One  of  the  powerful  aspects  of  this  technique  results

from  the  observation  that  the  three-level  system  can  be  reduced  to  an  equivalent  two-level

description  with  an  effective  linewidth  approximately  equal  to  the  quenching  rate.    Thus,  the

linewidth  of  the  effective  Doppler  cooling  transition  can  be  tuned  simply  by  changing  the

quenching power.  One can then envision a cooling procedure that starts with a broad transition

linewidth  (i.e.,  with  its  wide  Doppler  coverage  and  fast  cooling  rate)  to  cool  a  large  range  of

velocities  and  then  concludes  with  reduced  quenching  power  for  narrow-line  cooling  and  its

associated colder  temperatures.    For  cooling  on  the  clock  transition  of  Ca,  however,  achieving

high quenching rates is difficult since one necessarily must use a weak (intercombination) line to

pump atoms from the 3P1 level back to the singlet manifold for quick decay to the ground state.

We have chosen to use the 3P1→1S0 (4s4p→4s5s) transition at 552 nm (see Figure 1) rather than

the 3P1→1D2 (4s4p→4s4d) transition at 453 nm used in Ref. 11.  The two transitions have similar

Einstein  A  coefficients,  but  the  slower  (by  a  factor  of  two)  decay  from  the  1D2  state  actually

accelerates  the pumping process, since the  pumping  rate is  proportional  to  1/(cid:3),  where  (cid:3)  is  the

decay rate of the upper state in the three level system.  However, the advantage of using 453 nm

pumping is offset by the fact that the dyes used in the green lasers are generally more powerful

and longer-lived than those in the blue.  In either case, typical quenching times achieved thus far

range  from  25  to  50  (cid:1)s,  corresponding  to  cooling  linewidths  of  <  10  kHz.    These  effective

cooling linewidths are too narrow to realize the idealized tunable cooling as described above, so

we broaden the spectrum of the red laser to extend the capture range of the second-stage cooling

light.7,8,11 

Our cooling route to microkelvin temperatures (see timing diagram, Figure 2) begins with

first-stage laser trapping on the strong 1S0→1P1 transition at 423 nm.  The trapping apparatus has

4

been  described  elsewhere12,  so  we  describe  only  the  most  relevant  details  here.    A  frequency-

doubled diode-laser system generates 40 mW of trapping light at 423 nm, which we use to load

~2(cid:2)106  atoms  in  25  ms  from  an  atomic  beam  into  a  MOT.    The  resulting  temperature  of  the

trapped  atoms  is  2-3  mK.    We  follow  this  with  a  cycle  of  second-stage  cooling,  which  uses

simultaneous 657 nm cooling and 552 nm quenching light.  The 552 nm light comes from a dye

laser whose beam, after passing through an optical fiber and liquid-crystal light shutter, supplies

~100  mW  of  light  to  the  atoms.    For  long-term  stability  the  frequency  of  the  green  light  is

stabilized relative to a hyperfine component of a nearly coincident I2 transition. 

The 657 nm cooling light is generated by an extended-cavity diode laser whose output is

amplified  by  injection-locking  two  slave  lasers.    The  output  from  one  slave  passes  through  a

polarization-maintaining fiber and is used for second-stage cooling and trapping.  The other slave

supplies  light  to  two  separate  polarization-maintaining  fibers  that  provide  counter-propagating

beams for spectroscopy and pulsed cooling (see Refs. 10, 12 for spectroscopic details).  Since the

red  light  is  used  for  sub-kilohertz  spectroscopic  investigations  in  addition  to  the  cooling

described  here,  it  has  extremely  high  frequency  stability.    This  is  achieved  by  locking  its

frequency tightly to a narrow resonance of a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity (linewidth = 9 kHz).

The  cavity  is  vibrationally-  and  acoustically-isolated,  and  the  addition  of  temperature

stabilization  of  the  box  surrounding  the  cavity  has  led  to  drift  rates  of  only  a  few  hertz  per

second.  For cooling, the red light is detuned 850 kHz (±50 kHz) below resonance and broadened

to cover a 1.5  MHz wide spectrum by  applying frequency modulation at 20 kHz to a 72 MHz

acousto-optic modulator (AOM).  Deviations  of  20  %  for  these  modulation  parameters  did  not

noticeably  affect  the  cooling  results.    This  modulation  creates  a  comb  of  optical  frequencies

close  enough  together  that  the  atoms  remain  resonant  as  they  are  cooled.    The  comb  width

5

enables a larger portion of the initial velocity distribution of Ca atoms to be cooled and trapped

than with a single  frequency alone.   The trade-off  for  this  broader  spectrum  is  a  less  precisely

tailored spectrum around zero velocity, so we do not expect to attain the temperatures achievable

with single-frequency or pulsed cooling.

The red cooling beams (with an intensity of ~20 mW/cm2 per beam and 1/e2 diameter of

3 mm) are retro-reflected in three orthogonal directions and overlap the blue trapping beams.  A

single  green beam (with  an intensity  of  ~ 1 W/cm2 and 1/e2 diameter of  3  mm)  has  a  separate

retro-reflected  path  that  lies  along  two  orthogonal  axes.    The  polarization  of  the  red  beams

matches  that  of  the  blue  trapping  beams,  which  have  the  usual  (cid:4)+-(cid:4)-  configuration  for  a

magneto-optic trap.  The green beams, however, have the opposite circular polarization in order

to increase the likelihood of absorption of green and red photons from the same direction, thus

increasing  the  cooling  force.    This  increase  results  from  considerations  of  angular  momentum;

since the 1S0 upper state of the quenching transition has only an m=0 level, quenching of the +1

and -1 levels of the 3P1 state necessarily requires absorption of (cid:4)- and (cid:4)+ light, respectively.  To

add a spatial (i.e. trapping) component to the narrow-line cooling process we introduce a small

magnetic  quadrupole  field  (~30  (cid:1)T/cm  or  ~300  mG/cm)  as  has  been  used  in  similar  alkaline-

earth MOTs.7,8,11  The cooling results were not sensitive to the size of the gradient over the range

of 10-50 (cid:1)T/cm.

The second-stage cooling is followed by a pulse of quenching light (~100 (cid:1)s) that is used

to transfer those atoms remaining in the excited state to the ground state for maximum detection

efficiency.    We  then  use  a  red  spectroscopic  pulse  whose  frequency  is  swept  to  measure  the

velocity distribution of the atoms along one direction (one point per measurement cycle) via the

first-order Doppler shift.  In order to prevent broadening the duration of this pulse is chosen to

6

yield  a  Fourier-transform  width  much  less  than  that  of  the  velocity  distribution.    To  take

advantage  of  the  presence  of  the  quenching  light,  we  have  modified  the  normalized  shelving

detection  scheme  (based  on  near-resonant  blue  pulses)  used  in  our  previous  experiments  to

achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio.12  Now, instead of using a blue normalization pulse before

the  spectroscopy,  we  perform  the  normalization  at  the  end  of  the  spectroscopic  cycle.    The

detection process begins with a blue probe pulse that occurs after the red velocity probe pulse in

order to measure those atoms left in the ground state (i.e., those not in the velocity class excited

by the red probe pulse).  Atomic fluorescence excited by the standing-wave blue probe (intensity

~15  mW/cm2,  with  a  duration  of  30  (cid:1)s)  is  collected  by  a  lens  inside  the  vacuum  system  and

directed to a photomultiplier tube.  The excited atoms are then pumped back to the ground state

by a quenching pulse (552 nm, 150 (cid:1)s duration), and the ground-state population (now equal to

the  total  population  of  trapped  atoms)  is  measured  by  a  second  blue  normalization  pulse.

Dividing the integrated fluorescence of the first pulse by that of the second yields a normalized

excitation signal.  By keeping the time between intensity-stabilized blue probe pulses short (and

thus less sensitive to residual fluctuations in intensity), and by normalizing the excitation signal

relative to the number of atoms captured in the red/green trap (rather than to the number in the

blue trap), we are able to maintain the signal-to-noise ratio attained in the spectroscopy based on

millikelvin  atoms.    A  similar  scheme  was  recently  used  at  PTB,  using  a  different  version  of

shelving detection with quenching.13

As shown in  Figure 3, the  temperature  of  the  atom  cloud  drops  rapidly  in  the  first  few

milliseconds of red/green cooling and then levels off below 9 (cid:1)K for longer cooling times.  The

number of atoms transferred from the blue trap to the red/green trap also decreases with trap time

(see  Figure  4),  as  those  atoms  whose  velocity  is  not  within  the  capture  range  of  the  trap  (~40

7

cm/s) rapidly escape the observation region.  Similar results were seen in the second-stage MOT

used  at  PTB,  but  with  smaller  atom-transfer  efficiency,  which  we  attribute  to  less  quenching

laser power.    Figure 5 shows  a typical  velocity distribution after 15 ms of red/green trapping.

The  symmetry  of  the  measured  final  velocity  distributions  is  particularly  sensitive  to  the

alignment  of  the  green  cooling  beam,  since  an  asymmetry  of  green  absorptions  leads  to  an

asymmetric force on the atoms.  Optimization of the overlap of the retro-reflected beams for both

the trapping and quenching light increases the atom number and improves the overall symmetry

of  the  velocity  distributions.    The  temperature  limit  of  5-10  (cid:1)K  observed  for  these  traps  is  a

result of the recoils associated with the quenching process (recall that each absorption of a green

photon is followed by emission of photons at 1.03 (cid:1)m and 423 nm) as well as the shape of the

cooling light spectrum around zero velocity.

Improved Optical Frequency Standard

Our particular motivation for second-stage  cooling of Ca is to improve  the performance of our

optical  atomic  frequency  standard.    For  this  application,  an  optimized  version  of  this  second-

stage  cooling  scheme  would ideally have  the  shortest  trapping  time  (to  minimize  overall  cycle

time)  and  the  largest  number  of  atoms  (to  maximize  the  signal-to-noise  ratio),  as  well  as  the

coldest  temperatures  (to  attain  the  highest  accuracy).    As  a  compromise,  we  find  that  working

with a red/green trapping time of 5 ms allows the atom cloud to come into equilibrium (good fit

to  a  Gaussian)  at  a  temperature  of  10  (cid:1)K,  with  a  transfer  efficiency  of  28  %  (5.6(cid:2)105  of  the

originally  trapped  2.0(cid:2)106  atoms.)    With  such  a  narrow  distribution,  nearly  all  of  these  atoms

contribute  to  the  Bordé-Ramsey  interferometry  we  use  for  our  clock  measurements,  and  the

resulting lineshapes are virtually Fourier-transform-limited.  In Figure 6 we show a single 100-

8

second scan taken at a resolution of 11.55 kHz using ultracold atoms; the contrast in this Bordé-

Ramsey fringe pattern is nearly 40 %.  We note that the asymmetry in the fringe envelope is real

–  computer  simulations  based  on  the  formalism  developed  by  Bordé  et  al.14  show  the  same

asymmetric  envelope  and  indicate  that  it  results  from  atomic  recoil  shifts.    For  applications  to

frequency  metrology  we  actually  work  at  considerably  higher  resolutions  (usually  ~1  kHz  or

less), in order to have a more sharply defined line center.  The inset to Figure 6 shows the central

portion of a fringe pattern with 1.45 kHz resolution.

Let us now consider the improvements we expect to see in our optical standard based on

the parameters we  can  achieve for our ultracold atomic  sample.   The  most dramatic  difference

should  occur  in  the  overall  uncertainty  with  which  we  can  realize  the  unperturbed  atomic

frequency, since we were previously limited by velocity-related frequency shifts.  The two main

systematic effects relating to velocity result from (1) a non-zero transverse drift velocity of the

atomic  sample  combined  with  a  residual  mismatch  in  the  overlap  of  the  Bordé-Ramsey

spectroscopic  beams,  and  (2)  moving  atoms  sampling  the  phase  of  probe  beams  with  a  finite

radius of curvature.  Second-stage cooling reduces the vrms by a  factor of 15, thus reducing the

shifts due to these effects to < 1 Hz, a regime where other systematic shifts become significant

and will require a more detailed evaluation.13  Nonetheless, for a Ca standard based on ultracold

atoms, a frequency uncertainty of < 0.4 Hz (corresponding to a fractional uncertainty of < 10-15)

certainly seems feasible. 

A second critical parameter used to characterize clock performance is stability, which is

effectively a measure of  the frequency uncertainty that is achieved  for a  given  averaging time.

Due  to  their  high  line  Q’s,  optical  frequency  standards  have  demonstrated  superior  short-term

stability to that of their microwave counterparts.15  In that work, a comparison between our Ca

9

optical  clock  (based  on  millikelvin  atoms)  and  a  Hg+  optical  clock  (based  on  a  single  Hg  ion)

yielded a fractional frequency instability of 7(cid:2)10-15 at 1s, which represents the most stable short-

term performance demonstrated with atomic frequency standards.  In moving to a clock based on

ultracold atoms, we see some trade-offs in terms of short-term stability.  The longer loading and

preparation  time  of  the  atoms  leads  to  a  six-fold  increase  in  the  measurement-cycle  duration,

which  will  effectively  increase  the  averaging  period,  degrading  the  short-term  stability.

Moreover, the number of trapped atoms is reduced by nearly a factor of 10, which also reduces

the  signal-to-noise  ratio.    Fortunately,  this  reduction  is  mostly  offset  by  the  fact  that  with

ultracold atoms basically all the atoms contribute to the  fringe structure, rather than the  ~30 %

we had with the millikelvin atoms.  Accounting for the 2-3 times higher contrast achieved with

ultracold atoms at sub-kilohertz resolutions, we expect to see little net degradation in short-term

frequency  stability.    This  is  supported  by  our  initial  measurements  of  the  fractional  frequency

instability of the system based on ultracold atoms, which show an Allan deviation of < 2(cid:2)10-14 at

1s.    The  dominant  residual  noise  appears  to  be  frequency  noise  on  the  laser,  which  we  think

results from fluctuations in the length of the optical reference cavity, perhaps aggravated by the

Dick Effect (for microkelvin atoms our spectroscopic period is only a few percent of the whole

measurement  cycle).16    The  amplitude  noise  on  the  detection  sets  a  limit  of  <  10-14,  so  we  are

confident  that  with  improved  cavity  isolation  and  an  apparatus  better  suited  for  second-stage

cooling (with more optical access for capturing more atoms), we should be able to attain a short-

term  instability  of  close  to  1(cid:2)10-15  at  1s.    We  note  that  even  this  level  of  instability  is  still  an

order of magnitude  worse  than  estimates of what could be achieved  with  this Ca  transition, so

there is still plenty of room for improvement.13,17    

Additional 1-D Cooling

10

Experiment 

With the capability of starting experiments with trapped atoms at 10 (cid:1)K rather than at 2 mK, we

decided to revisit pulsed QNLC in 1-D.10  Our previous results had been hindered by two factors

associated  with  the  initial  millikelvin  temperature:  the  transverse  velocity  of  the  atoms  sets  an

upper limit of ~2.5 ms for the cooling time, while the width of the velocity distribution required

many  cooling  cycles  (i.e.,  long  cooling  time)  for  a  majority  of  the  atoms  to  reach  near-zero

velocity.    With  the  atoms  now  starting  much  closer  to  zero  velocity  in  3-D,  we  could  hope  to

reach sub-recoil temperatures in 1-D for a non-trivial fraction of the atomic sample.  

The  advantage  of  using  (cid:5)-pulse  excitation  on  the  narrow  red  transition,  followed  by  a

quenching pulse in the green, is that we have greater control over the frequency spectrum of the

cooling light.  Since the cooling pulses are much shorter than the lifetime of the excited state, the

effective  excitation  spectrum  of  the  light  is  basically  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  time

dependence of the cooling pulse.  We use square pulses in the time domain whose frequency is

detuned to the  red  such  that  the first zero of  the  resulting  (sin x/x)2 excitation spectrum lies at

zero velocity.1,2,10  This produces an effective dark state around zero velocity in which atoms can

accumulate.  Since the length of the  cooling  pulses  in time is inversely related  to  their span in

frequency (velocity) space, longer pulses produce a narrower hole around zero velocity and thus

colder velocity distributions.  The trade-off, however, is that these longer pulses drive a smaller

range  of  velocities  towards  zero,  so  it  is  advantageous  to  start  with  a  fairly  narrow  velocity

distribution.    

A typical  three-stage cooling cycle  is  shown in Figure 7.   We start with  our usual blue

cooling followed by red/green cooling and add a third stage that consists of a series of cooling

pulses  that  drive  the  atomic  velocities  toward  the  near  zero-excitation  region  around  zero

11

velocity.  After each pair of sequential red pulses (one from each direction and with an intensity

chosen  to  yield  a  (cid:5)-pulse  area),  a  quenching  pulse  follows  that  sends  the  atoms  around  to  the

ground state for another cooling cycle.  We alternate the directional order of the red pulses from

cycle to cycle to enhance the symmetry of the cooling process.  In order to use the m=0→m=0

magnetic-field-insensitive  transition  for  this  third  stage  cooling,  we  use  linearly-polarized  red

light  along  with  a  magnetic  bias  field  of  200  (cid:1)T  along  the  same  direction.    The  red  cooling

pulses are derived from the same laser and optical fibers that generate the spectroscopic pulses.

To  tailor  the  pulses,  we  use  switches  to  send  different  rf  signals  to  the  AOMs  controlling  the

intensity and frequency of the red light.  Note that we use the same quenching polarization and

spatial  configuration  as  in  the  second  stage,  which  in  our  present  beam  geometry  means  that

green light propagates both perpendicular and parallel to the pulsed red light.  As a result of the

quenching process, the atoms experience several recoils as they are pumped back to the ground

state.  Those atoms whose resultant velocity falls near zero will likely avoid re-excitation, while

the  remaining  atoms  will  undergo  another  cooling  cycle.    This  process  repeats  until  the  atoms

have  all  fallen  into  the  near-zero  velocity  “dark”  state,  or  by  virtue  of  an  unfavorable  recoil

sequence have landed outside the velocity range covered by the excitation pulses.  As before, we

use  high-resolution  657  nm  velocity  probe  pulses  to  measure  the  final  width  of  the  velocity

distribution along the direction of the 1-D cooling pulses.  

In Figure 8 we show the 1-D velocity distribution that results from a series of eight cycles

of the third-stage cooling using pulses with 10 (cid:1)s duration.  Each cycle contains a quenched red

sequence followed by a quenched red sequence with the pulses in opposite order – see Figure 7.

Note that we find that for cooling with pulses of duration < 15 (cid:1)s, the velocity distributions fit to

Lorentzian  lineshapes  rather  than  to  Gaussians,  as  was  the  case  for  3-D  cooling,  so  the  1-D

12

results are quoted using the half width, half maximum (HWHM) of the Lorentzian instead of an

rms width.18  For a sequence of eight cycles, the resulting VHWHM of the distribution is 1.3 cm/s

(corresponding to a temperature of 840 nK), approximately equal to the recoil limit (for a single

657  nm  photon).    Interestingly,  a  majority  of  the  cooling  occurs  during  the  first  two  cycles,

during which minimal heating of the transverse directions should occur.  

As  we  increase  the  length  of  the  pulses  beyond  15  (cid:1)s  in  order  to  reach  lower

temperatures, additional structure begins to appear in the baseline of the velocity distributions as

more atoms can access (sin x/x)2 zeroes that are not centered at zero velocity.  These additional

“dark” states limit the transfer efficiency into the coldest central peak (similar structure was seen

in our original QNLC experiments).  To reduce this effect, we implement sequences using pulses

of differing lengths (each with its associated detuning).  In one case we make the first pulse short

so that it transfers a large number of atoms towards zero velocity, and the second pulse long so

that it produces a narrow velocity distribution.  A sequence consisting of 5 cycles of 15(cid:6)(cid:1)s pulses

followed by  8 cycles of  25 (cid:1)s  pulses leads to a  central feature with a temperature  of ~520 nK

(see Figure 9).  One can see here the atoms accumulating in small peaks around the other zeroes

of the (sin x/x)2 function.  We find that, under these conditions, if we allow the atoms to decay

directly  from  the  excited  state  in  order  to  avoid  the  recoils  associated  with  quenching,  fewer

atoms  escape  the  capture  region.    This  has  however  the  undesirable  property  of  increasing  the

cooling time by a factor of four.  In an effort to achieve colder temperatures while maintaining

good  transfer  efficiency,  we  instead  employ  a  sequence  that  alternates  12  (cid:1)s  pulses  and  50  (cid:1)s

pulses  for  5  cooling  cycles.    This  combination  produces  a  velocity  distribution  whose  central

narrow  feature  has  a  temperature  of  only  300  nK  (one  fourth  of  the  single  photon  recoil

temperature), and transfers ~60 % of the atoms to the central peak. 

13

Spectroscopy

In preliminary experiments the third-stage 1-D cooling did not lead to a marked improvement in

the fringe contrast for four-pulse Bordé-Ramsey spectroscopy, since we were already close to the

theoretical limit of 50 % contrast.  However, this extra cooling stage does reduce the velocity of

the atoms to the point where the atoms move only a small fraction of an optical wavelength for

times as long as 20 (cid:1)s.  In this case we can obtain Ramsey fringe structure using only two pulses,

as  in  the  case  of  microwave  Ramsey  spectroscopy.    Figure  10  shows  two-pulse  fringes  for  a

Ramsey time (time between red pulses) of 5(cid:6)(cid:1)s.  For longer times the fringe contrast degrades as

the  atoms  move  a  greater  fraction  of  a  wavelength,  thus  adding  a  spatial  component  to  the

interference  process  that  effectively  washes  out  the  fringes.    Nonetheless,  with  sub-recoil

temperatures,  we  can  observe  fringes  for  Ramsey  times  beyond  20(cid:6)(cid:1)s.    Not  surprisingly,  the

fringe contrast is very sensitive to velocity; computer simulations of this process  yield velocity

widths in very good agreement with our direct measurements of the velocity distributions.  Due

to  their  first-order  Doppler  sensitivity  and  reduced  contrast  at  high  resolution,  these  two-pulse

fringes  will  not  supercede  the  four-pulse  variety  for  our  immediate  frequency-standard

applications,  but  they  do  offer  a  nice  demonstration  of  the  increased  coherence  of  the  atomic

sample.  While this is the first demonstration of two-pulse fringes in Ca, we emphasize that two-

pulse fringes have previously been seen in the analogous transition in Sr.18

Conclusions

We  demonstrate  3-D  second-stage  laser  cooling  and  trapping  of  Ca  with  fairly  high  transfer

efficiency.    This  greatly  reduces  the  dominant  systematic  frequency  shifts  for  the  Ca  optical

frequency standard, but also serves  as a  good starting place for further  experiments.    We  have

14

shown  one  example  in  which  we  have  used  pulsed  cooling  in  one  dimension  to  reduce  the

temperature  below  the  recoil  limit.    Other  possibilities  include  ramping  up  the  magnetic  field

gradient  to  increase  the  density  in  preparation  for  further  cooling  towards  Bose-Einstein

condensation.19  As has been demonstrated with Sr20, these ultracold  traps can  serve  as  a  good

starting  place  for  loading  far-detuned  optical  lattices.    In  fact,  a  promising  approach  for  an

optical  frequency  standard  would  be  to  load  ultracold  atoms  into  a  1-D  optical  lattice  for

sideband cooling on the clock transition and spectroscopic interrogation.  Following the concept

of Katori et al., we can choose the wavelength for the far-detuned dipole traps such that the Stark

shift  for  both  the  ground  and  excited  states  would  be  equal.21    One  could  thus  perform  the

spectroscopy  on  the  clock  transition  with  the  lattice  fields  on,  mimicking  the  environment

usually associated with trapped ions.  Under these conditions, one could imagine having virtually

a million non-interacting clocks, cooled to the Lamb-Dicke regime, with very small systematic

uncertainty and frequency instability.

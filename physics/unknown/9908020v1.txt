Abstract

A  new  method  for  numerical  solving  of  boundary  problem  for  ordinary

differential  equations  with  slowly  varying  coefficients  which  is  aimed  at  better

representation  of  solutions  in  the  regions  of  their  rapid  oscillations  or  exponential

increasing  (decreasing)  is  proposed.  It  is  based  on  approximation  of  the  solution  to

find in the form of superposition of certain polynomial-exponential basic functions. The

method  is  studied  for  the  Helmholtz  equation  in  comparison  with  the  standard  finite

difference  method.  The  numerical  tests  have  shown  the  convergence  of  the  method

proposed.  In  comparison  with  the  finite  difference  method  the  same  accuracy  is

obtained on substantially rarer mesh. This advantage becomes more pronounced, if the

solution varies very rapidly.

1. Introduction

In  many  fields  of  physics  the  problem  of  wave  propagation  and  absorption  in

non-uniform  media  is  under  investigation.  For  example,  in  the  controlled  fusion

problem  the  wave  propagation  phenomena  are  analyzed  both  analytically  and

numerically in application to  the  radio  frequency  plasma  heating  (e.g.  [1]),  the  MHD

plasma  stability  (e.g.  [2]),  the  radio  frequency  plasma    production  (e.g.  [3]).  The

problem of wave propagation is described, as a rule, by a set of differential equations.

These  equations  are  usually  solved  using  the  Fourier  expansion  or  the  discretization

(e.g.  [4]).  In  the  case  of  rapidly  oscillating  or  exponentially  increasing  (decreasing)

wave  fields,  employing    of  the  standard  discretization  methods  requires  a  very  fine

mesh.  For  example,  to  simulate  the  radio  frequency  field  excitation  in  plasma  of  the

LHD  stellarator [3] the mesh with number of nodes N=20000 was used. This number

will increase, if such modelling is performed in a larger device.

There  exist  a  lot  of  problems  when  the  coefficients  of  the  set  of  differential

equations  which  describe  the  wave  propagation  problem  vary  much  slower  than  the

solutions.  In this case, in the regions of rapid oscillations of the wave field one can use

the  WKB  solutions  (e.g.  [5]).  However,  using  them,  one  cannot  provide  prescribed

accuracy  and,  therefore,  cannot  control  convergence  of  the  calculations.  For  this

reason the WKB approximation cannot be considered as a proper numerical method.

In  the  present  paper  we  propose  a  new  method  for  solving  one-dimensional

problem which improves the accuracy of numerical solution especially in the regions of

rapid oscillations of the wave field. We call this approach as the local solution method.

This  method  essentially  exploits  the  fact  that  the  solution  of  a  system  of  linear

differential equations can be represented as superposition of some linearly independent

solutions  of  the  homogeneous  system  and  a  specific  solution.  The  main  idea  is  to

approximate this representation using certain basic functions in every mesh cell. There

is  wide  freedom  in  choice  of  such  functions.  When  using  them  in  the  form  of

polynomials  we  obtain  results  similar  to  the  results  of  the  standard  mesh  methods.

Aiming  at  more  exact  representation  of  the  solution  in  the  regions  of  its  rapid

oscillation and exponential increase (decrease) we have chosen the basic functions in a

polynomial-exponential form suggested by the form of the WKB solutions.

The  method  proposed  is  analyzed  for  the  Helmholtz  equation,  the  simplest

equation  describing  wave  processes.  In  section  2  we  analyze  theoretically  three

versions of the local solution method. In section 3 we present the results of numerical

tests  of  the  method  in  comparison  with  results  obtained  by  the  standard  finite

difference method.

Consider the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation

which  is  defined  at  the  interval

.  We  assume  that  the  function  G(x)  is  not

rapidly  oscillating  and  has  no  breaks  or  singular  points  at  this  interval.  To  solve

equation   (1) numerically we introduce a mesh with the nodes xi where i=1,2, … ,n.

The strategy of the numerical solving of this equation is as follows. Within the segment

si  ( x

In  this  way  we  obtain  2(n–2)  linear  algebraic  equations  for  2(n–1)  unknowns.  Two

equations  still  needed  are  to  be  obtained  from  two  boundary  conditions  at  the  end

point  of  the  interval  xl  ,  xr  .  The  resulting  matrix  of  the  described  equation  set  has

narrow band and, therefore, can be easily reversed. For the case of three segments and

the  boundary  conditions  posed  at  the  opposite  ends  of  the  interval,  the  portrait  of

matrix is shown in equation  1.

Using such solutions is similar to employing the finite difference or finite element

method of the corresponding order. For this reason this method with using polynomial

functions has no evident advantages before the widely used standard methods.

At  the  moment  we  will  not  pay  attention  to  the  form  of  the  specific  solution  which

should depend on the form of the function R(x) in equation   (1). For example, if the

function  R(x)  is  sufficiently  slowly  varying  at  the  segment  si  ,  a  polynomial

approximation (7b) is proper.

Now  discuss  the  approximation  (8),  (9)  in  more  detail.  Such  representation  of

the solutions makes it possible to describe rapidly oscillating or exponentially growing
(~)x  vary
(decreasing) solutions at the segment si even when the functions  A x(~)  and  F

slowly  at  this  segment.  (Here  and  below  we  omit  the  indices  of  the  solution  number

and the number of segment). Such situation takes place in the case when G0h2‡ 1, but
G1h3<<1.  In  this  situation  the  polynomial  approximation  of  the  solutions  (6a),  (6b)
leads  to  large  errors.  When  G0h2<<1  we  expect  that  the  polynomial-exponential

solutions and the polynomial ones will behave similarly.

First  it  is  necessary  to  show  that  such  type  of  solutions  can  fulfill  the

homogeneous  equation  (1)  with  certain  accuracy.  After  substituting  them  into  the

equation we obtain

In practice we have to cut the series (9) at some maximum powers, mA for  A x(~)  and
(~)x ,  sufficient  to  obtain  the  prescribed  degree  of  approximation.  To

  for F

mF

determine the unknown coefficients Am and km we require mA+mF

 equations. They can

be  picked  up  from  the  set  (11).  Note  that  since  the  set  of  equations  (11)  is

homogeneous,  one  of  the  coefficients  Am  ,  e.g.  A0,  should  be  assumed  to  be  known.

Note  that  the  set  of  equations  (11)  is  linear  in  coefficients  Am  and  non-linear  in

quantities  km.  In  general  case  such  system  of  equations  is  difficult  to  solve.  We  can

simplify  the  problem  decreasing  the  number  of  equations  involved  from  (11),  which

reduces  the  degree  of  approximation.  This  creates  some  freedom  in  choosing  the
quantities km . The most simple way is to determine  k x( ~)  from the equation

2(~)

k

 , 

which  is  similar  to  the  zero-order  WKB  approximation  for  equation  (1).  In  this  case

we  use  the  first  mA  equations  from  (11)  to  find  the  coefficients  Am  .  For  mA=2  and

mF =1 we can readily obtain the formulae

Another method of obtaining the local solutions we illustrate for mA= mF =1 . We

shall use two first equations from the set (11). This leads to an additional condition for

This scheme can be continued by consequent simultaneous increasing mA and mF

by  unity.  In  this  case  equation  (15)  will  be  more  complex.  However,  we  will  get  a

quadratic equation for the highest quantity  kmA

, if we substitute km values from lower

order approximations.

Another  modification  of  the  scheme  described  can  be  obtained  using  the

Further  we  shall  call  the  local  solution  method  in  the  form  (13)  and  (14)  as

version  1,  in  the  form  (16)  and  (17)  as  version  2,  and  in  the  form  (18)  and  (19)  as

version 3.

Note  that  all  the  local  solutions  of  the  form  (8)  considered  above  tend  to  the

. This makes it possible to use large-step mesh

for numerical calculations even in the regions where WKB approximation is valid.

When using the local solutions in the above mentioned forms one should keep in

mind that they either diverge or degenerate at the segment where G0=0 . Besides, there

can  arise  some  other  points  where  the  local  solutions  are  degenerate.  This  is  a

points  of  degeneration  can  be  found  from  analyzing  the  Wronskian  for  the  solutions.

3. Numerical experiments

In  this  section,  using  numerical  tests,  we  compare  the  versions  of  the  local

solution method proposed above with the standard finite difference method. For these

tests  we  use  the  homogeneous  Helmholtz  equation  (1)  putting  R(x)=0.  In  this  case,

non-trivial  solutions  of  the  equation  appear  owing  to  non-homogeneous  boundary

conditions. For the finite difference method [6] we employ the uniform mesh for which

the finite difference scheme can be written in the following simple form

The local solution method has been realized numerically following the procedure

described  in  section  2.  All  three  versions  of  the  considered  local  solutions  have  been

tested. The main part of calculations was performed for the function G(x)=3x . Thus,

the  solution  can  be  expressed  as  a  combination  of  Airy  functions,  Ai(

)33 x   and

-

-
Bi(

)33 x .  Besides  this,  the  function  G(x)=3x–0.06x2  has  been  used.  The  boundary

conditions employed are the following

As has been pointed out above, under certain conditions the local solutions in the

exponential form can degenerate. We use two methods to overcome this difficulty. The

first  one  is  to  use  the  polynomial  local  solutions  at  bad  segments  instead.  The

degeneration can be also avoided if we shift the end points of the bad segment. In the

calculations we use both methods. In the case of version  1  the  first  method  has  been

used. For version 2 we have used the second method. Remind that for this version the

only  case  of  degeneration  is  G0

.  For  version  3  we  improve  the  segment  with

G0

  by  the  second  method  and  use  the  first  method  at  segments  containing  the

Figure 3. Error of numerical solution of equation (1) showed in figure 2,
(a) - for version 3 of local solutions method, (b) - for version 2, (c) - for
version 1 and (d) - for finite difference method.

Figures 4a, 4b and 4c display the relative errors as a function of the number of

mesh nodes N for all three versions of the local solution method. For comparison, the

corresponding curve for the finite difference method is shown at every plot of figure  4

. First of all, we have to note that all the versions demonstrate the convergence to the

exact solution in average. The average rate of convergence is proportional to 1/N2

which corresponds to the degree of approximation and is similar to what we have in

the case of the finite difference method. At the same time, all three versions yield more

than two orders lower error level as compared to the finite difference method on the

same mesh. A characteristic feature of the local solution method is non-monotonous

convergence. The oscillations of the relative error are the largest in the case of version

1. For versions 2 and 3 these oscillations tend to vanish when N increases.

We  have  also  tested  the  method  proposed  for  a  solution  having  much  more

oscillations in the x domain. In this case we have used another form of the G-function,

the  parabolic  one:  G x

xr=45.0 . The corresponding solution is shown in figure  5. It can be reproduced by the

finite difference method. At N=20000 it yields the relative error d = 2.1(cid:215) 10–3. Version 3

of the local solution method yields nearly the same error d =  2.2(cid:215) 10–3 at N=240 .

4. Conclusions.

In  the  presented  paper  we  have  analyzed  and  tested  numerically  the  local

solution method as applied to the Helmholtz equation. This method differs in principal

from  the  standard  methods  of  finite  differences  and  finite  elements.  The  method  of

local solutions makes it possible to use a wider class of basic functions approximating

the  solution,  not  only  the  polynomial  ones.  The  most  gain  can  be  obtained  when  the

basic functions are close to exact  solutions.  In  the  present  paper  we  have  considered

the basic functions of the polynomial-exponential type. The form of these functions is

close to the WKB solutions. Owing to this we have obtained good numerical accuracy

if the solutions are rapidly oscillating or exponentially increasing (decreasing). Besides,

these basic functions are also able to reproduce the solutions with prescribed  accuracy

in  regions  of  slow  solution  variation.  This  allows  one  to  apply  the  method  of  local

solutions to general problems.

The  numerical  tests  performed  have  demonstrated  convergence  of  the  method

proposed.    In  average  the  convergence  corresponds  to  the  degree  of  approximation,

although  it  is  not  monotonous  general.  The  method  proposed  has  shown  the  evident

advantage before the standard finite difference method of the same order for modelling

solutions of the Airy equation  and the parabolic-cylinder-type equation. Depending on

the solution character, the local solution method requires 10-100 times rarer mesh than

finite difference method to obtain the same accuracy.

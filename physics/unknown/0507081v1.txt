Photonic bandgap engineering using aperiodic lattices (AL’s) is systematically studied. Up 

to now AL’s have tended to be defined by specific formulae (e.g. Fibonacci, Cantor), and 

theories  have  neglected  other  useful  AL’s  along  with  the  vast  majority  of  non-useful 

(random)  AL’s.  Here  we  present  a  practical  and  efficient  Fourier  space-based  general 

theory, to identify all those AL’s having useful band properties, which are characterized by 

well-defined  Fourier  (i.e.  lattice  momentum)  components.  Direct  real-space  optimization 

of AL’s tends to be computationally demanding, and is also difficult to generalise beyond 

1D.  However,  via  our  Fourier  space-based  inverse optimization  algorithm,  we  efficiently 

tailor  the  relative  strength  of  the  AL  Fourier  components  for  precise  control  of  photonic 

band and localization properties.

In  the  design  of  photonic  crystals  used  in  photonic  integrated  circuits  and  dense 

wavelength  division  multiplexing  (DWDM)  systems,  increasing  importance  is  being  placed  on 

careful control of the transmission characteristics, which derive from the device band properties. 

There is thus a high premium on the ability to engineer the band properties of a photonic crystal 

in  a  systematic  manner.  Photonic  crystals1  are  usually  characterized  by  a  well-defined  lattice 

periodicity.  However,  photonic  bandgap  (PBG)  engineering2,3,  for  example  to  achieve  field 

localization  or  fine  tuning  of  the  band  properties,  requires  breaking  of  the  lattice  periodicity 

thorough  the  introduction  of  single  or  multiple  defects  (missing  or  extra  scattering  sites)4-7. 

Whilst  this  renders  the  lattice  essentially  aperiodic8,9  in  the  most  general  sense,  it  is  highly 

unlikely that a randomly chosen aperiodic lattice (AL) will have any useful field localization or 

band properties. Hence the question is how to identify the relatively small number of useful AL’s 

(in terms of their band properties) from the very large number of possible AL’s? 

Conventional  PBG  engineering  has  tended  to  be  based  mostly  on  a  ‘forward’  process  of 

defining  a  lattice  structure  and  then  determining  the  band  properties,  e.g.  through  the  use  of 

constraining formulae such as the Fibonacci or Cantor based quasi-periodic lattices10-12; through 

coupled-cavity  structures,  proposed  by  Yariv  et  al.6;  or  by  intuition  (accumulated  design 

experience) and trial-and-error, such as the high-Q cavity structures reported by Akahane et al.13. 

There  has  also  been  a  growing  interest  in  the  ‘inverse’  process  of  determining  appropriate 

aperiodic  photonic  lattices  from  the  desired  scattering  properties  (functionality)14-18.  With  the 

exception  of  quasiperiodic  lattices,  which  can  form  stop-bands  considerably  away  from  the 

conventional Bragg frequency, these techniques modify the spectral functionality mostly within 

or around the Bragg stop-band. Also in most cases (both ‘forward’ and ‘inverse’) the underlying 

principle is the direct optimization of the band properties by characterization of the AL’s in real-

space.  Even  for  a  moderate  number  of  scattering  sites  and  defects  these  methods  become 

computationally extremely demanding, and complex to generalise beyond 1D.

In this paper we believe we present the first general theory and systematic design tool to 

reveal  a  previously  unknown  landscape  of  essentially  aperiodic  lattices  (AL’s),  which  show 

useful  and  novel  spectral  (bandgap)  functionalities,  e.g.  tuneable  bandgaps,  and  multiple 

localized states. Previous theories have discarded these useful AL’s along with the vast majority 

of non-useful (random) AL’s, because they have characterized photonic lattices only with regular 

periodicity  of  the  real  space  lattice.  However,  as  we  explain  in  our  paper,  we  have  adopted  a 

Fourier-space (k-space) approach19, where AL’s having useful band properties are characterized 

by well-defined spatial frequency (i.e. lattice momentum) components. We have used a discrete 

Fourier transform (DFT)-based inverse optimization algorithm to tailor the Fourier components 

of an AL to match that of a “target” function; the target function, also of course, being defined in 

Fourier-space and equating to the desired band properties. Overall, the entire scheme turns out to 

be  much  more  practical  and  efficient  in  achieving  desired  and  controllable  photonic  band 

functionality. Indeed, we demonstrate that AL’s20-22 inherently offer the most flexible platform to 

achieve novel spectral functionalities. In this context, our method provides answers to questions 

such  as:  For  a  given  overall  length  and  lattice  constant L

 of  a 1D lattice,  what are the  various 

defect  combinations 

that  produce  discontinuities  along 

the  angular  frequency  w-axis 

corresponding  to  various  discrete  wavevector  points  between,  say,  kBR=  p/L 

(edge  of  the 

Brillouin  zone)  and  0.5kBR?  Or  even  more 

importantly 

in 

the  context  of  optical 

telecommunications,  e.g.  DWDM  components:  What  defect  combinations  for  this  lattice  will 

provide  localized  photon  states  (i.e.  high  photon  transmission)  at  desired  optical  frequencies, 

useful for multi-wavelength narrowband optical filters and tuneable semiconductor lasers? 

The underlying physics behind the PBG effect and electromagnetic (EM) wave localization 

is the Bragg resonance between the wavevector k of EM radiation and the lattice momentum G. 

In the simplest case of a periodic 1D lattice, composed of layers of two different materials with 

geometric thicknesses H and L and refractive indices nH and nL respectively, when the condition

p2=

known  in  digital  signal  processing  (DSP)  that  the  DFT  of  a  real  series  produces  a  symmetric 

amplitude  spectrum  about  the  highest  sampling  frequency  (known  as  the  Nyquist  frequency). 

This  principle,  taken  together  with  the  symmetry  observed  in  the  spectral  responses  of  1D 

quasiperiodic  superlattices11,  suggests  that  the  scattering  sites  of  any  real-space  AL  can  be 

regarded  as  samples  with  a  spatial  frequency  less  than  the  highest  spatial  frequency  GBR  (the 

Nyquist frequency).  Hence, the Fourier transform (FT)  of  an  AL  defined  by  a  set  of  scattering 

sites {xp} will give a set of spatial frequency components {Gq} that forms a symmetric spectrum 

about  the  highest  spatial  frequency  GBR,  where  the  lattice  reciprocal-space  variable  G  is  the 

Fourier  conjugate  to  the  real-space  variable  x.  Generalising  the  Bragg  resonance  condition 

between all of these spatial frequency components {Gq} and the set of EM angular frequencies

  gives  us  a  qualitative  determination  of  the  spectral  transmission  (reflection)

characteristic  for  EM  wave  propagation  through  the  AL,  indicated  in  Fig.  1.  Clearly,  this 

procedure  results  in  transmission  dips  centred  on  the  set  of  frequencies  {wq},  with  symmetry 

about 

cG=w

2/BR

.  Overall,  this  is  an  initial  clue  that  the  transmission  characteristic  of  a 

photonic lattice is closely related to its spectral-distribution characteristics, i.e. the FT of its real-

space  structure  (equivalent  to  the  first  Born  approximation24).  This  FT  link  is  the  basis  of  our 

inverse design approach. 

For  mathematical  convenience,  the  following  DFT-based  inverse  analysis  has  been 

conducted in 1D only, however, we note that since the analysis is FT-based, it is easily extended

defects  inside  the  lattice  can  be  controlled  simply  by  manipulating  the  polarity  fp  of  any

for the following analysis  is  sufficient  due to  the symmetric redundancy in the spectrum about 

the  Nyquist  frequency,  discussed  above.  We  can  tailor  the  Fourier  components  distribution, 

given by equations 1 and 2 according to our need, and a subsequent inverse FT will generate a 

real-space  lattice  configuration.  Various  band  properties,  e.g.  the  strength  of  bandgaps  or 

localized  states,  depend  only  on  the  amplitude  of  the  associated  Fourier  component,  with  the 

phase characteristic therefore being a degree of freedom (i.e. arbitrary). This makes the inverse 

calculation  analogous  to  the  calculation  of  a  computer-generated  hologram  (CGH)25,  with  the

the  factorially-large  search  space.  We  use  a  non-deterministic  simulated  annealing  (SA) 

optimization  algorithm,  to  search  this  configuration  space.  By  controlling  the  defects  in  the 

lattice its configuration is optimized when the cost function E is minimized, where

each  of  which  is  close  to  an  overall  global  optimum  in  cost-space.  From  a  practical  point  of 

view,  the  functionality  of  these  solutions  tends  to  be  indistinguishable.  As  part  of  the  design 

process, the appropriate value for N is adopted to reflect the fabrication resolution and the overall 

physical  size  of  the  lattice,  with  G  existing  in  a  quasi-continuous  space  as  N  tends  to  infinity. 

Having generated an AL, we check that its transmission properties (i.e. band properties) are in 

agreement with the desired transmission characteristics. Conventional methods for this forward 

determination  of  the  transmission  characteristics  of  an  AL  use  either  transfer  matrix  (TM) 

methods,  finite-difference  time-domain  (FDTD)  approaches,  or  eigen-mode  expansion  (EME) 

techniques.  However,  we  use  the  Fourier  transform  equation  (4),  which  has  been  derived  in 

Ref.23  by  solving  the  Ricatti  equation  for  the  scattering  coefficient  between  a  pair  of  forward- 

and  backward-propagating  coupled-modes,  for  quick  and  efficient  (yet  reasonably  accurate) 

calculation of the transmission characteristics of our AL’s.

D is a modified Debye-Waller factor required to avoid the well-known phase accumulation 

error. Taking advantage of the efficient FFT algorithm, the full SA optimisation for a particular 

AL  with  N=112  took  less  than  1  minute  using  a  Pentium  IV  processor  with  2.8GHz  clock 

frequency,  and  512MB  RAM.  For  larger  N,  the  number  of  operations  for  the  FFT  scales  as 

NlogN, and the overall SA optimisation scales accordingly. Higher dimensionality d AL’s simply 

scale as 

dN d log

N

. 

Employing  N=112  unit-cells,  with  the  normalised  DFT  Nyquist  frequency  (GBR) 

corresponding to  N/2 = 56,  we have 28 discrete points (indexed by the DFT variable q) between 

the edge of the Brillouin zone (corresponding to kBR, q=56) and 0.5kBR, where q=28. To illustrate 

this,  we  present  results  for  the  first  five  points  corresponding  to  q=56,55,54,53,  and  52 

respectively. We emphasize, though, that the lattice can be designed to exhibit a stop band ‘on 

demand’ at any position corresponding to q=1 through to q=56; however, space constraints allow 

us  to  show  in  Fig.  2  (i-v)  only  examples  for  the  first  five  positions  (the  corresponding  lattice 

configurations  are  presented  in  Table  I).  Figure  2(i)  shows  the  spectrum  for  a  conventional 

periodic  lattice  with  a  bandgap  at  the  edge  of  the  Brillouin  zone  (i.e.  q=56).  Transmission 

characteristics  in  Fig.  2  (ii-v)  show  the  symmetric  photonic  stop  gaps  being  shifted  in 

incremental  steps  of  about  0.02fBR,(i.e.  2fBR/N)  away  from  the  Brillouin  zone  edge,  by  using 

defects in well-defined locations in the photonic lattice. We also note the occurrence of resonant 

peaks between the two symmetric photonic stop bands. These resonant peaks form as a result of 

interference of different Bragg stop-bands, i.e., those Fourier components which make the lattice. 

Precise control of these peaks, important for DWDM components (e.g. when realised within the 

cavity of a semiconductor laser to enable tuning26 ), thus requires tailoring of the relative strength 

of  the  different  Bragg  stop-bands.  An  important  example  is  the  so-called  single-defect  (0.5L

) 

Fabry-Perot-type lattice27 (used in a quarter-wave shifted DFB laser), corresponding to the q=55 

AL. The high-frequency band-edge transmission peak of the lower bandgap (at 0.98fBR), and the 

low-frequency band-edge transmission peak of the upper bandgap (at 1.02fBR) overlap to form a 

 

7 

single,  very  narrow  resonant  (localized)  transmission  peak  at  the  Bragg  frequency.  In  the 

example spectra of Fig.2(ii-v) we haven’t tried controlling these peaks, as the intention is more 

to demonstrate the controlled tunability of Bragg stop-bands. Fig.2(vi), however, presents an AL 

which  exhibits  three  high  transmission  (localized)  states  at  0.98fBR,  fBR,  and  1.02  fBR.  We  note 

that Fig.2(vi) can also be seen as an example of an AL exhibiting two Bragg stop-bands within 

the  Brillouin  zone.  We  also  note  that  as  the  resulting  complexity  of  the  optical  transmission 

characteristic  is  increased  the  individual  Bragg  stop-bands  become  less  well  defined.  By 

introducing  ever  more  defects,  Fig.  2  shows  a  progression  from  a  periodic  to  ever-more  AL’s, 

with  the  bandgap  being  shifted  further  away  from  the  Brillouin  zone  edge.  In  so  doing,  the 

number of scatterers is reduced, so that the overall bandgap strength is reduced, but we note that 

we  can  straightforwardly  increase  the  PBG  bandgap  strength  again  by  simply  increasing  N,  or 

the refractive index contrast D e. 

In  conclusion,  we  have  presented  a  theory  based  on  a  Fourier  space  approach  to  achieve 

controllable  field  localization  and  photonic  band  properties  using  AL’s.  We  believe  this  work 

will help PBG engineering find new applications, for example, with multiple defects introduced 

into a 3D photonic crystal fabricated using holographic lithography29.

calculated  using  EME28,  (vi)  using  equation  4.  The  aperiodic  binary  photonic  lattices  were 

designed in a rib-type single mode silicon waveguide by implementing the required changes in 

relative permittivity through binary modulation of the waveguide width. The effective refractive 

indices of  the fundamental  mode in the two  widths  of the  waveguide  were found to  be nH=2.6 

and nL=2.42 respectively. The optical path length for each waveguide-section was chosen to be a 

quarter Bragg-wavelength, with the Bragg wavelength lBR =1550nm, so that the two geometric 

lengths are H» 149nm, and L » 160nm respectively.

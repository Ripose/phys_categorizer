Abstract:  Exchange  arrangements  among  different  countries  over  the  world  are 
foundations of the world economy, which generally stand behind the daily economic 
evolution. As the first study of the world exchange arrangements web (WEAW), we 
built  a  bipartite  network  with  countries  as  one  type  of  nodes  and  currencies  as  the 
other,  and  found  it  to  have  a  prominent  scale-free  feature  with  a  power-law  degree 
distribution.  In  a  further  empirical  study  of  the  currency  section  of  the  WEAW,  we 
calculated  the  clustering  coefficients,  average  nearest-neighbors  degree,  and  average 
shortest  distance.  As  an  essential  economic  network,  the  WEAW  is  found  to  be  a 
correlated  disassortative  network  with  a  hierarchical  structure,  possessing  a  more 
prominent scale-free feature than the world trade web (WTW).   
 
Keywords: economic network, exchange rate, scale-free, hierarchy, correlation.

I. Introduction 

Generally, the topology of a network is mathematically described by a graph. Two 
recent discoveries of scale-free and small-world network models [1-2] have been able 
to successfully describe the topological properties of many real-life complex networks, 
such as the Internet, WWW, metabolic networks, language web, and many social and 
biological networks [1-8]. Some common features in these complex networks include 
power-law  degree  distributions  (the  scale-free  feature),  and 
large  clustering 
coefficients with small average path lengths (the small-world feature), which cannot 
be  well  explained  by  the  ever-dominating  and  now-classical  Erdös-Rényi  (ER) 
random graph theory [9-10].       

The  economic  globalization  promotes  different  countries(cid:146)  economies  to  be 
integrated together in terms of trade and capital flow [11-12]. The countries(cid:146) economic 
activities  are  considered  as  being  organized  within  a  network  structure,  which  does 
have  a  significant  influence  on  the  observed  economic  collective  behaviors  [13-15]. 
The viewpoints of complex networks are of interest in studying economic networks, 
to uncover the structural characteristics of the networks built on competitive economic 
systems. Serrano and Boguæá  [16] first explored the topology of the world trade web 
(WTW),  announcing  that  the  WTW  has  scale-free  and  small-world  features  in  a 
hierarchical  structure,  similar  to  the  Internet  and  WWW.  Li,  Jin  and  Chen  [14]  then 
statistically  rebuilt 
the  economic-cycle  synchronous 
phenomenon on this scale-free trade web. Other studies on Japanese business network 
[17],  urban  economic  network  [18],  and  stock  price  network  [19]  have  also  found 
power-law degree distributions.   

the  WTW,  and  studied 

Exchange  rate  is  an  important  factor  that  can  influence  a  country(cid:146)s  conditions  to 
participate 
international  economic  cooperation  and  competition.  Exchange 
arrangement  is  the  policy  that  shapes  the  exchange  rate  behaviors.  It  is  argued,  for 
example,  that  the  financial  crises  in  East  Asia  in  1997  was  an  outcome  of  the  fixed 
exchange  arrangements  employed  by  those  Eastern  Asian  countries.  It  was  then 
suggested  by  many  economists  that  a  country  should  have  more  flexible  exchange 
arrangements in order to avoid such crises [20]. Every country has its own exchange 
arrangement.  Therefore,  there  exists  a  world  exchange  arrangements  web  (WEAW), 
which  provides  the  channels  to  transfer  a  country(cid:146)s  economic  change  to  other 
countries. The web makes countries more interdependent than ever. For instance, the 
strengthening of USD versus Japanese Yen can give a kind of sluggish effect to East 
Asian  economies  through  the  exchange  arrangements  among  them  [20].  As  the 
foundation  of  the  world  economy,  the  topological  structure  of  the  WEAW 
unavoidably  and  in  effect  significantly  influences  the  collective  economic  behaviors 
such as economic dynamics spreading and crises propagation. It should be noted that 
the topology of the WEAW does not have significant change in a long period since the 
collapse of the Bretton Woods System, because any country would not like to adjust 
its  exchange-rate  regime  frequently.  Therefore,  to  the  specific  interest  of  this  paper, 
we  attempt  to  uncover  the  topological  properties  of  the  WEAW,  leaving  a  further 
study of its complex dynamical features to the near future.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, the classification of various exchange 
arrangements  is  introduced,  and  the  WEAW  is  defined  and  constructed.  Section  III 
investigates and visualizes the topological characteristics of the WEAW, such as the 
average 
degree  distribution,  clustering  coefficient,  average  path 
nearest-neighbors degree, etc. Section IV concludes the paper with some discussions.

II. The WEAW 

Exchange  rate  is  the  price  of  a  foreign  currency  in  units  of  local  currency  or, 
conversely, the price of a local currency in units of foreign currency.    Every country 
has  its  own  exchange  arrangement  to  determine  the  exchange  rates  of  its  local 
currency.   

In the statistics of International Monetary Fund annual report, there are totally eight 
categories of exchange arrangements [21]: (1) exchange arrangement with no separate 
legal  tender,  (2)  currency  board  arrangement,  (3)  conventional  pegged  arrangement, 
(4) pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands, (5) crawling peg, (6) crawling band, 
(7)  managed  floating  with  no  pre-announced  path  for  the  exchange  rate,  (8) 
independently  floating.  Under  independently  floating  exchange  arrangement,  it  is 
generally  believed  that  the  exchange  rate  is  determined  by  the  foreign  exchange 
market,  that  means  the  government  authority  does  not  intervene  the  exchange-  rate 
behaviors in the foreign exchange market. Under the other seven arrangements, local 
currency  is  generally  pegged  to  one  or  more  foreign  currencies  in  different  degrees, 
which  means  the  government  authority  intends  to  maintain  the  stability  of  the 
exchange rates of its local currency versus some foreign currencies to some preferred 
degree.  IMF  [21]  has  collected  official  exchange  arrangements  of  152  countries, 
where  only  50  countries  officially  stated  that  they  employ  independently  floating 
exchange arrangements (Table 1).

independently  floating.  For  simplicity, 

As  defined  in  Table  1,  the  allowable  flexibility  degree  of  exchange  rate  under 
different  arrangements  are  increased  from  exchange  arrangement  with  no  separate 
the  eight  exchange 
legal 
arrangements  are  generally  divided  into  two  basic  groups  [20,  22]:  Pegged 
arrangement  and  floating  arrangement.  Pegged  arrangement  implies  an  explicit  or 
understood  commitment  undertaken  by  the  policy  authorities  to  limit  the  extent  of 
fluctuation  of  the  exchange  rate.  Quite  a  broad  range  of  regimes  share  this  general 
characteristic, from exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender, to currency 
board  arrangement,  to  conventional  pegged  arrangement,  to  pegged  exchange  rate 
within horizontal bands, to crawling peg, to crawling band, and to managed floating 
with  no  pre-announced  path  for  the  exchange  rate.  Floating  arrangement  refers  to 
independently floating [20]. A recent study [22] reveals the exchange arrangements of 
developing countries in the period of 1990-1999, and totally 158 developing countries 
and  regions  employed  the  pegged  exchange  arrangement,  in  which  some  countries 
officially adopt the floating arrangement.

Because pegged  arrangement builds  a  connection between  the local currency  of a 
country  and  the  foreign  currencies,  there  exists  a  web  of  exchange  arrangements 
among all countries in the world, namely world exchange arrangements web (WEAW). 
To uncover the topology of this web, we will first build a bipartite network, in which 
the nodes are categorized into two groups: country nodes and currency nodes, and the 
edge  between  every  pair  of  a  country  node  and  a  currency  node  represents  the 
exchange  arrangement  employed  by  this  country.  A  country  employs  pegged 
arrangement will connect those currencies its currency is  pegged  to.  Such a country 
will also connect to its own local currency. The country with floating arrangement will 
only connect to its own local currency. Figure 1 is an illustration of a fraction of the 
WEAW.

In Fig.1, country A only connects to its local currency a, and A does not peg to any 
other foreign currencies while its local currency is not pegged by any other countries 
neither. Some developed countries such as Canada, Japan, Norway belong to this case. 
Countries D and E both connect to the same currency d, which represents the case of a 
currency union such as the European Currency Union, and the case of countries that 
employ exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender, such as those countries 
holding Eastern Caribbean Dollar and USD as their domestic currencies. Country B, 
representing almost all developing countries, not only connects to its own currency b, 
but also pegs to some other foreign currencies such as c. And country C is the case of 
Australia,  South  African  etc.,  which  peg  to  other  currencies  while  whose  local 
currencies  are  pegged  by  other  countries.  A  dashed  line  is  a  connection  between  a 
country and its own local currency, and a solid line is a connection between a country 
and its pegged currency. With the statistical data of IMF [21] and the research results 
of Kawai [22], the WEAW totally has 186 country nodes and 152 currency nodes, and 
400 connections among all these country nodes and currency nodes.     

 

III. Complex topology of the WEAW 

One  of  the  most  important  topological  properties  of  a  network  is  the  degree 

distribution, 

)(kP

,  which  quantifies  the  probability  of  a  randomly  chosen  node  to 

have exactly 

k

  connections to some other nodes. An alternative measure of 

)(kP

  is

Hierarchy is generally analyzed by the clustering coefficient and the degree-degree 
correlation.  In  the  present  bipartite  network,  there  are  two  types  of  nodes,  and  no 
triangles  and  polygons  exist  in  it.  Hence,  we  cannot  calculate  the  clustering 
coefficients for this bipartite network. To further study the hierarchical structure of the 
WEAW,  we  consider  the  WEAW  in  its  currency  section  as  a  pure  currency-node 
network, as shown in Fig. 3, where a triangle can exist as illustrated.   

It  can  be  found  that  from  Fig.  3  that  there  is  an  isolated  node  a  in  the  currency 
section  of  the  WEAW.  That  is  because  such  a  currency  is  not  pegged  by  any  other 
countries(cid:146) currencies, and, at the same time, its home country A employs the floating 
arrangement  therefore  it  does  not  peg  to  other  currency.  Such  instances  include  the 
currencies  of  11  countries  such  as  Canada,  Denmark,  Greece,  Iceland,  Norway, 
Sweden,  Switzerland,  etc.  The  rebuilt  WEAW  has  141  currency  nodes  and  197 
connections,  whose  cumulative  degree  distribution  is  log-log  plotted  in  Fig.  4.  The

node  degree 
interconnected  communities  (with  a  high  clustering  coefficient),  while  hubs  connect 
many nodes that are not directly connected (with a small clustering coefficient) [6, 24]. 
Based on the available real data, we computed the clustering coefficients of the rebuilt 

WEAW, and found that, although there are not many clusters in this web, 

kc

  have a 

k

. More precisely, those nodes (currencies) with 
declining trend on the node degree 
low  degrees,  such  as  Nepal  Rupee,  Nigeria  Naira,  Botswana  Pula,  etc.,  have  larger 
clustering  coefficients  than  those  nodes  with  high  degrees,  such  as  Norway  Krone, 
South  African  Rand,  and  USD.  Furthermore,  those  currency  hubs  like  USD,  ECU, 
Great Britain Pound (GBP) are not directly connected, which leads to their very small 
clustering  coefficients  (USD:  0.0008,  ECU  and  GBP:  0).  The  averaged  clustering 
, which is very small but still about 2 
coefficient of the whole WEAW is 
times larger as compared with the value 0.02 corresponding to a random network of

the  same  size  with  the  same  amount  of  connections.  The  average  path  length  of  the 
rebuilt WEAW is the average of the shortest distances between all pairs of currency 
  =2.43.  Compared  to  the  same  size  of  random 
nodes,  and  is  calculated  as 
networks,  the  WEAW  shows  a  larger  clustering  coefficient  and  a  similarly  small 
average path length, which indicates this hierarchical web is also a small world.

Another reflection of the web hierarchy is on the degree-degree correlation through 

the conditional probability 

P

(

, which is the probability of a node of degree 

’k

 

.  To  overcome  the  difficulty  in  calculating  the 
to  be  linked  to  a  node  of  degree 
conditional  probability,  the  correlation  is  generally  quantified  by  the  average

.  However,  it  has  been 
If  a  network  is  uncorrelated,  its  ANND  is  independent  of 
discovered  that  almost  all  real-life  networks,  such  as  the  Internet  and  WTW,  show 
degree-degree  correlation  [5-6,  16,  24].  The  correlation  can  be  assortative  or 
disassortative, depending on the ANND is increasingly or decreasingly dependent on 
.  Figure  5  is  the  ANND  of  the  rebuilt  WEAW,  with  a  clear  deceasing 
the  degree 
dependency  on  the  node(cid:146)s  degree.  The  dashed  line  and  the  solid  line  are  both

  and  0.3,  respectively. 

Therefore, the WEAW is a disassortative network, where highly connected currency 
nodes trend to connect to poorly connected currency nodes. Furthermore, the web not 
only is disassortative, it also exhibits two levels of disassortativity: one applies to the 
majority of nodes with low degrees, the other applies to those with high degrees, to 
which  USD,  ECU,  GBP,  and  Japanese  Yen  belong.  Therefore,  it  is  revealed  a 
hierarchical  and  correlated  architecture  in  the  WEAW,  and  those  relatively  highly 
inter-connected currencies that belong to influential areas connect to other influential 
areas through the hub: USD.       

IV. Conclusions and discussions   

In this paper, we have constructed a world exchange arrangements web, the WEAW, 
and have pointed out that such an international exchange arrangements network falls 
into the scale-free and small-world networks categories. With the observation on the 
currency  section,  this  WEAW  has  been  found  to  be  a  disassortative  network  with  a 
hierarchical structure.       

As  summarized  in  Table  2,  the  WTW  [14,  16],  business  network  [17],  urban 
economic  network  [18],  and  stock  price  network  [19]  have  also  been  shown  to  be 
scale-free networks. In all these studied economic networks, only the WEAW and the 
WTW  have  now  been  fully  discussed  on  their  topological  features,  and  there  are 
indeed  some  essential  differences  between  them.  As  pointed  out  in  [16,  23],  those 
low-degree  countries  in  the  WTW  do  not  undertake  the  preferential  attachment 
mechanism, where part of degree distribution is very close to that of an ER random 
network. However, such a local-world phenomenon has not been found to exist in the 

 

 

Accepted by Physica A, in press 

WEAW,  which  means  that  the  scale-free  feature  is  more  prominent  in  the  currency 
exchange market than in the trade web.   

It should be noted again that the topology of the WEAW does not have significant 
change in a long period since the collapse of the Bretton Woods System. Because the 
scale-free  featured  web  of  the  international  exchange  arrangements  is  almost  fixed, 
the  topological  influence  from  the  WEAW  on  the  currency  crises  and  economic 
deflation spreading should cause more attention globally. For example, a viewpoint of 
stabilizing the world currency is to keep USD, EUR, and JPY stable [20], which are 
three biggest currency nodes in the WEAW.   

Very recently, the phenomena of transition to chaos have been observed in complex 
dynamical  networks  [25],  which  are  found  to  be  much  easier  to  be  achieved  in 
scale-free  networks.  As  competitions  have  been  proved  to  accelerate  the  chaotic 
butterfly  attractors  in  exchange  markets  [26],  it  deserves  to  further  investigate  the 
relation  between  the  discovered  scale-free  competitive  WEAW  and  the  chaotic 
exchange rate behaviors [27-28].

Abstract 
 

Numerical simulations have shown that a recently proposed “crabbed waist” scheme of 
beam-beam collisions can substantially increase the luminosity of a collider. In this paper we 
give  a  qualitative  explanation  why  this  scheme  works.  For  this  purpose  we  use  simple 
geometrical considerations and analyze peculiar properties of vertical motion modulations by 
synchrotron  and  horizontal  betatron  oscillations.  It  is  shown  that  in  the  "crabbed  waist" 
scheme these modulations, which are the main sources of beam-beam resonances excitation, 
are  significantly  suppressed.  Some  numerical  examples  demonstrating  the  effect  of  the 
crabbed waist collisions are also given.

LUMINOSITY CONSIDERATIONS 

1 
 

The  recently  proposed  Crabbed  Waist  (CW)  scheme1)  of  beam-beam  collisions  can 
substantially increase collider luminosity since it combines several potentially advantageous 
ideas. The first one is large Piwinski’s angle. For collisions under a horizontal crossing angle 
θ (flat beams) the luminosity L, the horizontal ξx and the vertical ξy tune shifts scale as2):

As it is seen from (2), there are four possibilities of increasing Piwinski’s angle: 
 

1)  Increasing  the  bunch  length  σz.  According  to  (1-2)  this  allows  to  increase  N 
proportionally  to  (1+φ2)1/2.  In  this  case  ξy  remains  constant,  ξx  decreases  and  L 
increases proportionally to N. The overlap area of colliding bunches does not change. 

 
2)  Increasing  the  crossing  angle  θ  (but  in  assumption  it  remains  to  be  <<  1).  The 
consequences  are  actually  the  same  as  in  the  previous  case,  but  the  overlap  area  of 
colliding bunches decreases as 1/θ. 

 

3)  Decreasing the horizontal emittance εx and, therefore, the horizontal beam size σx. In 
this case, if φ >>1, we should keep the same N, so that all the values ξx, ξy, L do not 
change.  The  only  effect  is  that  the  overlap  area  of  colliding  bunches  decreases. 
However, if we go from small φ ≤ 1 to large values, we need to decrease N in order to 
keep the ξ values, so the luminosity even drops slightly. On the other hand, if one (or 
both) of the 1–2 possibilities were also exploited (ξx decreased), we can afford some 

— 3 — 

ξx increase due to εx change, while ξy can be controlled by the betatron coupling, so 
we can keep N and L unchanged. 

 
4)  Decreasing the horizontal beta-function βx and, therefore, the horizontal beam size σx. 
In this case, if N is increased proportionally to (1+φ2), ξx will not change, but ξy will 
grow proportionally to N (assuming that σx · (1+φ2)1/2 = const, for φ >>1). Or, if we 
do not change N, it simply results in ξx decrease. 

As usual, ξy is more “flexible” parameter as it can be controlled by the coupling (change 
of σy), so the main limit on the beam current N is set by the horizontal tune shift ξx. On the 
other  hand,  using  the  1-2)  and  4)  features  we  can  decrease ξx  significantly,  far  below  the 
beam-beam  limit,  while  the  coupling  cannot  be  changed  too  much:  very  small  values  are 
difficult to achieve, big values result in the vertical aperture (in units of σy) decrease. Thus, 
we can conclude that the 1) and 2) features easily allow the N and L increase proportionally 
to (1+φ2)1/2, while 3) and 4) can allow some N and L increase, but it is more questionable and 
requires  the  coupling  increase,  shrinking  the  vertical  aperture  (in  units  of σy).  So,  the  main 
advantages of the 3) and 4) features are the overlapping area decrease, plus ξx decrease by 4). 
In  the  proposed  CW  scheme3,4)  the  crossing  angle  is  increased,  but  not  significantly  –  by  a 
factor of 2-3 as compared to the currently working meson factories (DAFNE and KEKB). The 
main  accent  is  made  on  the  significant  σx  decrease.  Thus  we  do  not  get  very  essential 
luminosity gain when only increasing the Piwinski’s angle, but it opens the possibility for the 
next step (second idea): significant βy decrease. 
 

It  is  well  known  that  decreasing βy at the  IP is very  profitable  for the luminosity (see 
Eq.1). In assumption that we should have the same beam-beam tune shift ξy, the βy decrease 
1/2  (if ξx allows, that is just the case for large Piwinski’s angles), 
allows the N increase as 1/βy
3/2. But in order to get all these advantages we (usually) need 
so the luminosity goes up as 1/βy
to keep the bunch length not larger than βy. So, in ordinary IR concepts the main limitation on 
further  βy  decrease  is  set  by  the  lower  limit  on  the  achievable  bunch  length σz.  But  more 
precisely, the condition is that βy should be comparable to the overlapping area, not the bunch 
length!  Usually  (head-on  or  small φ)  these  two  are  comparable,  but  with  large  Piwinski’s 
angle the overlapping area becomes much smaller than σz, allowing significant βy decrease:

And  this  can  give  us  very  significant  gain  in  the  luminosity!  The  additional  advantages  of 
such collision scheme are: 
 

•  There is no need to decrease the bunch length to increase the luminosity as proposed 
in  standard  upgrade  plans  for  B-  and  Φ-  factories5,6,7).  This  will  certainly  ease  the 
problems of HOM heating, coherent synchrotron radiation of short bunches, excessive 
power consumption, etc. 

 
•  The  problem  of  parasitic  collisions  (PC)  is  automatically  solved  since  with  higher 
crossing angle and smaller horizontal beam size the beams separation at the PC is very 
large in terms of σx. 

 

 

— 4 — 

On the other hand, such a scheme of collision induces strong X-Y betatron resonances, 
which may cause troubles in making choice of the working point, and lower the achievable 
luminosity. Fortunately, a very attractive and simple solution was proposed recently1), which 
solves this problem – the Crabbed Waist (CW). One of the reasons it was proposed for is the 
geometrical  luminosity  increase,  but  calculations8)  showed  that  for  the  typical  beam 
parameters  the  gain  in  luminosity  is  relatively  small,  of  the  order  of  5-10%.  So,  the  main 
profit  of  the  CW  comes  from  the  beam  dynamics  considerations  –  the  betatron  resonances 
suppression. This is the third idea accomplishing the new concept of the IR design.

BEAM DYNAMICS CONSIDERATIONS 

Here  we  qualitatively  consider  the  main  features  of  different  collision  schemes 
concerning beam-beam interaction, in particular how the vertical particle’s motion is affected 
by  the  synchrotron  and  horizontal  betatron  oscillations.  The  “luminosity”  aspect  is  not 
considered here. What is important in the “old concept” (φ ≤ 1): where the particle meets the 
center  of  the  opposite  bunch.  This  is  what  we  call  CP  (Collision  Point),  while  the  IP 
(Interaction Point) is the nominal CP for an equilibrium particle. The main features of the old 
concept are: 
 

a)  The X-Y betatron resonances appear due to the vertical beam-beam kick’s dependence 
on the horizontal particle’s coordinate (amplitude modulation), see Fig.2. The horizontal 
kick also depends on the vertical coordinate, but for the flat beams this dependence is 
much weaker. 

b)  Without  crossing  angle  the  SB  resonances  appear  by  two  reasons.  The  first  one  is  the 
betatron  phase  advance  modulation  from  IP  to  CP,  especially  for  the  vertical  betatron 
motion (assuming βy is small, flat beams). The second one is the ξy increase at the CP 
(that is an amplitude modulation), when shifted longitudinally from IP, due to the hour-
glass effect, see Fig.3 (red line).

correspond to head-on collisions: flat beams (red) and round beams (blue). 
Green line corresponds to the crossing angle collisions, flat beams. 

 
With crossing angle (horizontal, small Piwinski’s angle, see Fig. 4) we have: 
 

c)  Horizontal coordinate of the test particle in CP (in the strong bunch’s coordinate frame) 
depends  mainly  on  the  particle’s  longitudinal  coordinate,  that  results  in  a  strong 
amplitude  modulation  of  both  horizontal  and  vertical  beam-beam  kicks  by  the 
synchrotron  oscillations.  This  can  excite  strong  synchro-betatron  resonances,  both 
horizontal and vertical. 

 
d)  Particles with non-zero X-coordinate have the CP shifted longitudinally. This is similar 
with the effect of synchrotron oscillations, but induces X-Y betatron resonances instead 
of  synchro-betatron  ones.  However,  this  effect  is  rather  small  for  φ ≤  1,  since  the 
longitudinal shift of CP due to X-oscillations is not significant, much smaller than βy. 

 
e)  ξy  decreases  at  the  CP  (when  shifted  longitudinally  from  IP)  due  to  horizontal 
separation, see Fig.3. Although the ξy decreasing could seem better than increasing, it is 
in  any  case  an  amplitude  modulation  and  results  in  synchro-betatron  resonances 
excitation.

In  the  “new  concept”  (large  Piwinski’s  angle)  the  situation  is  rather  different.  The 
center  of  the  opposite  bunch  is  not  so  important  and  can  be  not  seen  at  all  (due  to  large 
horizontal separation) by the particles with large longitudinal displacements. So, the CP has 
to  be  defined  in  a  different  way:  now  it  is  the  point  where  the  test  particle  crosses  the 
longitudinal axis (i.e. trajectory of the equilibrium particle) of the opposite beam, see Fig. 5. 
The main features of the new concept (step by step) are: 
 
2.1  Large Piwinski’s angle (small overlapping area, but still βy ∼ σz) 
 

1)  Particle  interacts  with  a  small  part  of  the  opposite  bunch,  near  the  IP.  When 
considering the vertical beam-beam kick, the rest of the bunch is not seen due to large 
horizontal separation. The horizontal kick, however, is more “long-distance”. Indeed, 
for  large  horizontal  separations  the  horizontal  kick  strength  drops  as  1/r,  while  the 
vertical one – as 1/r2. But in general, as our main concern is the vertical motion, and 
since  the  overlapping  area  (OA)  is  much  smaller  than  βy,  we  can  consider  CP 
coincides  with  the  nominal  IP.  Since  the  particle’s  betatron  phase  and  the  opposite 
beam’s  parameters  at  the  CP  do  not  depend  on  the  particle’s  longitudinal  and 
horizontal coordinates, the effects of (b) and (d) vanish. 

2)  The  vertical  beam-beam  kick’s  dependence  on  the  particle’s  X-coordinate  becomes 
much  smaller  than  in  the  ordinary  IR  design,  –  almost  negligible,  since  the  particle 
shifted  horizontally  crosses  the  opposite  bunch  in  the  point  slightly  shifted 
longitudinally, but with actually the same density, and the geometry of collision will 
be the same as for the equilibrium particle, thus eliminating the (a) effect. This makes 
the  X-Y  betatron  resonances  much  weaker  than  even  in  the  ordinary  head-on 
collisions!  So,  the  beam-beam  interaction  can  be  considered,  in  some  sense,  as  one-
dimensional. 

3)  The  synchrotron  motion  still  affects  the  beam-beam  interaction  through  the 
modulation  of  the  density  of  the  opposite  bunch  at  the  CP:  the  particle  shifted 
longitudinally  will  meet  at  the  IP  the  other  part  of  the  opposite  bunch,  also  shifted 
longitudinally, and therefore having the different density. This is the only modulation 
remaining.

4)  On the other hand, the betatron phase advance over the OA is small, so a particle fills 
a  “solid”  kick  in  a  constant  phase.  This  makes  the  beam-beam  interaction  even 
stronger  as  compared  to  the  normal  situation,  where  the  betatron  phase  averaging 
during the interaction makes the beam-beam kick “smoother”. 

 
2.2  Small βy at the IP (to fit the OA) 
 

5)  The vertical betatron phase advance from IP to CP becomes significant again. So, the 
betatron phase modulation appears again and becomes much stronger than in (d) case, 
since the longitudinal shift of CP due to horizontal betatron oscillations is comparable 
now with βy, see Fig. 6. 

 
6)  Amplitude  modulation  of  the  vertical  beam-beam  kick  (i.e.  ξy)  by  the  horizontal 
betatron oscillations also appears, and has two sources: βy of the “weak” beam in the 
numerator and σy (that is proportional to βy

1/2 ) of the “strong” beam in denominator. 

 
7)  The phase averaging over the interaction region appears again, smoothing the beam-
beam  kick.  This  leads  also  to  a  strong  suppression  of  the  vertical  synchro-betatron 
resonances9).

8)  When applied to the “weak” beam, it removes the betatron phase modulation at the CP 
(see  explanations  in  the  next  chapter).  Besides,  the  amplitude  modulation  also 
changes: βy of the “weak” beam in CP (ξy numerator) is not modulated anymore, but 
modulation of σy (“strong” beam, ξy denominator) still remains. 

 
9)  When  applied  to  the  “strong”  beam,  it  somehow  affects  the  beam-beam  kick’s 
dependence  on  the  particle  coordinates,  so  that  Bassetti-Erskine  formulae  cannot  be 
used more. It is not clear yet how it could affect the beam-beam resonances, whether it 
is profitable or not, but we believe it is much less significant than suppression of the 
betatron phase modulation.

BETATRON RESONANCES SUPPRESSION BY THE CRABBED WAIST 

Let us consider in more details how the Crabbed Waist (CW) works. According to the 
definition,  it  means  that  for  the  particles  shifted  horizontally  (betatron  X-coordinate  is  not 
zero)  the  minimum  of  the  vertical  beta-function  (i.e.  the  vertical  waist)  is  shifted 
longitudinally.  The  necessary  nonlinear  transformation  can  be  provided  by  two  sextupoles 
placed  on  both  sides  of  the  IP.  The  horizontal  and  vertical  phase  advances  between  the 
sextupoles and the IP must satisfy the following conditions:

where “*” denotes the beta-functions at the IP, without “*” – at the sextupole location. The 
two  sextupoles  must  have  the  different  polarity.  If  the  (4)  conditions  are  satisfied,  they 
exactly  compensate  each  other,  so  all  the  perturbations  induced  by  them  become  local.  In 
these  conditions  we  can  say  that  between  the  sextupoles  βy  is  a  function  of  the  horizontal 
betatron  coordinate  X.  So,  for  a  particle  with  any  given  X-coordinate  we  can  consider  the 

— 9 — 

(6) 

sextupoles  as  additional  linear  lenses,  as  if  they  are  a  part  of  linear  lattice.  What  is  very 
important: in such a lattice the condition (4) for Δμy is valid for the phase advance between 
the  sextupoles  and  the  CP  (not  IP)!  Indeed,  the  transport  matrix  M  (see  Fig.  7)  from  the 
entrance of the first sextupole to the CP (vertical betatron motion only) can be written as:

where the first matrix corresponds to the drift space from IP to CP, L being the drift length, 
the last matrix corresponds to the sextupole, considered here as a thin linear lens, and in the 
middle is the unperturbed matrix m from the sextupole location to the IP. It is important to 
note that m22 = 0, since αy = 0 at the IP and Δμy = π/2. As a result, for M we get this matrix 
element  equals  to  zero  too:  M22  =  0.  On  the  other  hand,  considering  the  “new”  lattice 
(sextupoles included) we can write the standard formula for M22:

where β1y and α1y are the beta- and alpha-functions at the CP. Since it is the waist at the CP, 
α1y must be equal to zero, so we get cos(Δμ1y)= 0, resulting in Δμ1y = π/2, that is exactly what 
we wanted. In the other words, the vertical betatron phase advance from the first sextupole to 
CP  and  then  from  CP  to  the  second  sextupole  remains  to  be  π/2  for  all  the  particles 
independently on their X-coordinate, thus eliminating the vertical betatron phase modulation 
by the horizontal betatron oscillations. 
 

Now  let  us  consider  amplitude  modulation  of  the  vertical  beam-beam  kick  caused  by 
the  βy  modulation  at  the  CP.  The  vertical  tune  shift  depends  on  both  “weak”  and  “strong” 
betas, as follows:

FIG.  8:    In  CW  scheme  the  “weak” βy at the CP’s is always in the  minimum and does  not 
depend on X-coordinate, but the “strong” βy goes up when CP is shifted from the nominal IP.

— 10 — 

Here  in  the  numerator  we  have  “weak”  βy,  and  in  the  denominator  –  “strong”  beam  size. 
Without Crabbed Waist both betas at the CP are actually the same, the difference is negligible 
when θ << 1. It means that ξy scales as (βys)1/2. In the Crabbed Waist scheme βyw = const at the 
CP, so ξy scales as (βys)–1/2, that is inverse dependence of the one without CW, see Fig. 8. This 
means that if the waist rotation is smaller than the nominal value, the amplitude modulation 
should decrease while some phase modulation appears again. From here we can conclude that 
there  is  some  “optimum”  angle  of  the  waist  rotation  –  as  a  compromise  between  amplitude 
and phase modulations, which should depend on the other parameters (ξ, φ, etc.). Usually the 
optimum lies somewhere in the range of 0.6 to 0.8 of the nominal value, see Fig. 9.

In simulations, however, we can exclude the βys modulation very easily: increase βys by 
a factor of, say, 100 and decrease the “strong” vertical emittance εy by the same factor. In this 
case the optimum waist rotation must be shifted to the nominal value 1.0, that is exactly what 
we  obtained  in  our  simulations,  see  Fig.10.  The  second  row  in  the  table  corresponds  to  1.5 
times higher tune shift (“strong” bunch current).

The effect of the betatron resonances suppression by the CW becomes the most obvious 
when looking at the luminosity scan vs. betatron tunes, see Fig.11. As one can see, with the 
Crabbed  Waist  many  X-Y  betatron  resonances  disappear  or  become  much  weaker,  so  the 
good working area enlarged significantly, plus the maximum luminosity increased by a factor 
of about 2. One more example is presented on Fig. 12, where the SuperB4) parameters were 
used.

The  only  strong  resonances  remaining  are  the  horizontal  synchro-betatron  ones  (satellites  of 
half-integer resonance). In Fig.11 such resonances (satellites of integer) are not visible, since 
the  scan  area  there  was  from  0.05  to  0.20.  The  vertical  synchro-betatron  resonances  are 
suppressed,  that  is  in  good  agreement  with9).  And  we  do  not  see  any  strong  betatron 
resonances on Fig.12, in contrast with Fig.11, where we can see some. The reason is that the 
Piwinski’s angle for SIDDHARTA is not so big and the CW mechanism is working not in full 
strength.

CONCLUSIONS 

The main features of the Crabbed Waist scheme of collision can be summarized in three 

items: 
 

1)  Large Piwinski’s angle  –  to decrease the overlapping area. 

2)  Low βy to fit the overlapping area  –  this is the main source of the luminosity increase. 

3)  Crabbed  Waist  –  to  suppress  the  betatron  resonances,  allows  significant  ξy  and 

luminosity increase. 

 
It  is  worth  to  note  that  the  modulations  in  CW  scheme  become  significantly  smaller  as 
compared to head-on collision scheme, thus the beam-beam limit ξy increases by a factor of 
about 2-3!

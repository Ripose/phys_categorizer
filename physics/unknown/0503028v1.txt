Abstract 
Non-local  connections,  i.  e.  long-range  space-time  correlations  intrinsic  to  the  observed 
subatomic dynamics of quantum systems is also exhibited by macro-scale dynamical systems 
as selfsimilar fractal space-time fluctuations and is identified as self-organized criticality. The 
author  has  developed  a  general  systems  theory  for  the  observed  self-organized  criticality 
applicable  to  dynamical  systems  of  all  space-time  scales  based  on  the  concept  that  spatial 
integration  of  enclosed  small-scale  fluctuations  results  in  the  formation  of  large  eddy 
circulation.  The  eddy  energy  spectrum  therefore  represents  the  statistical  normal  distribution 
according  to  the  Central  Limit  Theorem.  The  additive  amplitudes  of  eddies,  when  squared 
(variance or  eddy  kinetic energy), represent  the statistical  normal (probability)  distribution,  a 
result observed in the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems. The  model predicts Kepler’s 
laws  of  planetary  motion  for  eddy  circulation  dynamics.  Inverse  square  law  of  gravitation 
therefore  applies  to  the  eddy  continuum  ranging  from  subatomic  to  macro-scale  dynamical 
systems,  e.g.  weather  systems.  The  model  is  similar  to  a  superstring  model  for  subatomic 
dynamics  which  unifies  quantum  mechanical  and  classical  concepts  and  manifestation  of 
matter  is  visualised  as  vibrational  modes  in  string-like  energy  flow  patterns.  The  cumulative 
sum  of  centripetal  forces  in  a  hierarchy  of  vortex  circulations  may  result  in  the  observed 
inverse square law form for gravitational attraction between inertial masses of the eddies.

1. Introduction 

turbulent  fluid  flows,  exhibit 

Atmospheric  flows,  a  representative  example  of 
long-range 
spatiotemporal  correlations  manifested  as  the  fractal  geometry  to  the  global  cloud  cover  pattern 
concomitant  with  inverse  power  law  form  for  spectra  of  temporal  fluctuations.  Such  non-local 
connections  are  ubiquitous  to  dynamical  systems  in  nature  and  are  identified  as  signatures  of  self-
organized  criticality  [1].  A  review  of  research  work  on  the  applications  of  selfsimilarity  and  self-
organized criticality in atmospheric sciences is given in [2]. A cell dynamical system model developed 
for atmospheric  flows shows  that the  observed long-range  spatiotemporal correlations are  intrinsic to 
quantumlike mechanics governing fluid flows [3 - 5]. The model concepts are independent of the exact 
details such as the chemical, physical, physiological and other properties of the dynamical system and 
therefore  provide  a  general  systems  theory  applicable  to  all  real  world  and  computed  dynamical 
systems in nature [6 - 13].  

The  model  is  based  on  the  concept  that  spatial  integration  of  enclosed  small-scale  fluctuations 
results  in  the  formation  of  large  eddy  circulations.  The  model  predicts  the  following:  (i)  the  flow 
structure  consists  of  an  overall  logarithmic  spiral  trajectory  with  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling 
pattern  for  the  internal  structure  (ii)  conventional  power  spectrum  analysis  will  resolve  such  spiral 
trajectory as a continuum of eddies with progressive increase in phase (iii) increments in phase angle 
are  concomitant  with  increase  in  period  length  and  also  represents  the  variance,  a  characteristic  of 
quantum systems identified as ‘Berry’s phase’ (iv) the universal algorithm for self-organized criticality 
is  expressed  in  terms  of  the  universal  Feigenbaum’s  constants  [14]  a  and  d  as  2a2=pd  where,  the 

2

fractional  volume  intermittency  of  occurrence  pd  contributes  to  the  total  variance  2a2  of  fractal 
structures  (v)  the  Feigenbaum’s  constants  are  expressed  as  functions  of  the  golden  mean  (vi)  the 
quantum  mechanical  constants  ‘  fine  structure  constant’  and  ‘ratio  of  proton  mass  to  electron  mass’ 
which are pure numbers and obtained by experimental observations only, are now derived in terms of 
the  Feigenbaum’s constant  a (vii) atmospheric  flow  structure follows  Kepler’s  third law  of planetary 
motion.  Therefore  Newton’s  inverse  square  law  for  gravitation  applies  to  eddy  masses  also.  The 
centripetal accelerations representing inertial masses (of eddies) are equivalent to gravitational masses. 
Fractal structure to the spacetime continuum can be visualized as a nested continuum of vortex (eddy) 
circulations  whose  inertial  masses  obey  Newton’s  inverse  square  law  of  gravitation.  The  model 
concepts  are  equivalent  to  a  superstring  model  for  subatomic  dynamics,  which  incorporates 
gravitational  forces.  El  Naschie  [15]  and  Argyris  and  Ciubotariu  [16]  have  discussed  the  fractal 
structure to spacetime and also state that fractalisation of micro-space is the origin of gravity. 

2. A general systems theory for fluid flows: A string theory for fractal spacetime 

The  fractal  spacetime  fluctuations  of  dynamical  systems  may  be  visualized  to  result  from  the 
superimposition of an ensemble of eddies, namely an eddy continuum. The relationship between large 
and small eddy circulation parameters are obtained on the basis of Townsend’s [17] concept that large 
eddies are envelopes enclosing turbulent eddy (small-scale) fluctuations (figure 1).  

Figure 1. Physical concept of eddy growth process by the self-sustaining process of ordered energy feedback 
between the larger and smaller scales, the smaller scales forming the internal circulations of larger 
scales. The figure shows a uniform distribution of dominant turbulent scale eddies of length scale 2r. 
Larger-eddy circulations such as ABCD form as coherent structures sustained by the enclosed turbulent 
eddies. 

The  relationship  between  root  mean  square  (r.  m.  s.)  circulation  speeds  W  and  w*  respectively  of 

large and turbulent eddies of respective radii R and r is then given as

The  dynamical  evolution  of  spacetime  fractal  structures  is  quantified  in  terms  of  ordered  energy 
flow  between  fluctuations  of  all  scales  in  (1),  because  the  square  of  the  eddy  circulation  speed

represents the eddy energy (kinetic). A hierarchical continuum of eddies is generated by the integration 
of  successively  larger  enclosed  turbulent  eddy  circulations.  The  eddy  energy  (kinetic)  spectrum  then 
follows statistical normal distribution according to the Central Limit Theorem [18]. Therefore, square of the 
eddy  amplitude  or  the  variance  represents  the  probability.  Such  a  result  that  the  additive  amplitudes  of 
eddies,  when  squared,  represent  the  probability  densities  is  observed  for  the  subatomic  dynamics  of 
quantum systems such as the electron or photon [19]. Townsend’s visualization of large eddy structure as 
quantified in (1) leads to the important result that the self-similar fractal fluctuations of atmospheric flows 
are manifestations of quantumlike chaos. Incidentally, one of the strangest things about physics is that 
we seem to  need two different  kinds  of  mechanics, quantum  mechanics for microscopic  dynamics  of 
quantum  systems  and  classical  mechanics  for  macro-scale  phenomena  [20  -  23].  The  above 
visualization  of  the  unified  network  of  atmospheric  flows  as  a  quantum  system  is  consistent  with 
Grossing’s [21] concept of quantum systems as order out of chaos phenomena. Order and chaos have 
been reported in strong fields in quantum systems [24]. 

The square of the eddy amplitude W2 represents the kinetic energy E given as (1)  
nHE =

for growth  of large eddies sustained by constant energy input  proportional to w*
small scale eddy fluctuations. Energy content of eddies is therefore similar to quantum systems which 
can  possess  only  discrete  quanta  or  packets  of  energy  content  hn  where  h  is  a  universal  constant  of 
nature (Planck's constant) and n is the frequency in cycles per second of the electromagnetic radiation. 
The relative phase angle between large and turbulent eddies is equal to r/R and is directly proportional 
to W2 (1). The phase angle therefore represents variance and also there is progressive increase in phase 
with increase in wavelength. The above relationship between phase angle, variance and frequency has 
been  identified  as  Berry's  Phase  [25]  in  the  subatomic  dynamics  of  quantum  systems.  Berry’s  phase 
has been identified in atmospheric flows [4].

The above equation (3) is analogous to Kepler’s third law of planetary motion, namely, the square 
of the planet’s year (period) to the cube of the planet’s mean distance from the Sun is the same for all 
planets [26, 27]. Newton developed the idea of an inverse square law for gravitation in order to explain 
Kepler’s laws, in particular, the third law. Kepler’s laws were formulated on the basis of observational 
data  and  therefore  are  of  empirical  nature.  A  basic  physical  theory  for  the  inverse  square  law  of 
gravitation  applicable  to  all  objects,  from  macro-scale  astronomical  objects  to  microscopic  scale 
quantum  systems  is  still  lacking.  The  model  concepts  are  analogous  to  a  string  theory  [28]  where, 
superposition  of  different  modes  of  vibration  in  stringlike  energy  flow  patterns  result  in  material 
phenomena  with  intrinsic  quantumlike  mechanical  laws  which  incorporate  inverse  square  law  for 
inertial forces, the equivalent of gravitational forces, on all scales of eddy fluctuations from macro- to 
microscopic scales. The cumulative sum of centripetal forces in a hierarchy of vortex circulations may 
result in the observed inverse square law form for  gravitational attraction between inertial masses (of 
the eddies). Uzer et. al [29] have discussed new developments within the last two decades which have 
spurred  a  remarkable  revival  of  interest  in  the  application  of  classical  mechanical  laws  to  quantum 
systems. The atom was originally visualized as a miniature solar system based on the assumption that 
the laws of classical mechanics apply equally to electrons and planets. However within a short interval 
of time the new quantum mechanics of Schrodinger and Heisenberg became established (from the late 
1920s) and the analogy between the structure of the atom and that of the solar system seemed invalid 
and  classical  mechanics became  the  domain  of the  astronomers.  There is  now a revival  of interest in

classical  and  semi-classical  methods,  which  are  found  to  be  unrivaled  in  providing  an  intuitive  and 
computationally tractable approach to the study of atomic, molecular and nuclear dynamics. 

The  apparent  paradox  of  wave-particle  duality  in  microscopic  scale  quantum  systems  [20]  is 
however physically consistent in the context of macro-scale atmospheric flows since the bi-directional 
energy  flow  structure  of  a  complete  atmospheric  eddy  results  in  the  formation  of  clouds  in  updraft 
regions  and  dissipation  of  clouds  in  downdraft  regions.  The  commonplace  occurrence  of  clouds  in  a 
row  is  a  manifestation  of  wave-particle  duality  in  the  macro-scale  quantum  system  of  atmospheric 
flows  (figure  2).  Recent  experiments  by  S.  S.  Afshar  [30]  have  shown  that  the  subatomic  system, 
photon,  exhibits  both  wave  and  particle  characteristics  at  the  same  time.  Recent  theoretical  studies 
indicate that the particle’s mass can be thought of as extending throughout space-time as a wave, with 
the  result  that  the  global  geometry  of  space  -  its  curvature  throughout  the  Universe  depends  on  the 
properties of that wave [31]. 

The  above-described  analogy  of  quantumlike  mechanics  for  atmospheric  flows  is  similar  to  the 
concept of a subquantum level of fluctuations whose spacetime organization gives rise to the observed 
manifestation of subatomic phenomena, i. e. quantum systems as order out of chaos phenomena. 

Puthoff  [32]  has  shown  that  the  observed  stability  of  ground-state  electronic  orbits  in  atoms  is  a 
result  of energy  exchange  with  the sea  of electromagnetic  energy  available  in  the  vacuum zero  point 
fluctuations. Quantum theory predicts that vacuum is constantly fizzing with particles that pop in and 
out of existence [33]. Historically, quantum mechanics had imposed arbitrary stability criterion for the 
ground state of electron orbits. Stable  ground state is not possible in classical physics since attractive 
forces  between  the  negative  electron  and  positive  nucleus  will  result  in  spiraling  of  orbital  electrons 
into  the  nucleus  accompanied  by  loss  of  energy  due  to  emission  of  radiation  by  the  accelerating 
electron,  since  all  accelerating  charges  radiate  energy.  Puthoff  [34]  has  also  put  forth  the  concept  of 
"gravity as a zero-point fluctuation force". The vacuum zero-point fluctuation (electromagnetic) energy 
is  manifested  in  the  Casimir  effect  [35],  namely  a  force  between  two  closely  spaced  metal  plates. 
Casimir effect is interpreted as due to imbalances in the zero-point energy caused by  the presence of 
the  plates  and  is  analogous  to  the  turbulent  scale  fluctuations  whose  spatial  integration  results  in 
coherent  large  eddy  structures.  Recent  studies  show  that  background  noise  enhances  weak  signals  in 
electronic  circuits  [36].  El  Naschie  [15]  has  proposed  in  a  series  of  papers  that  Cantorian-fractal 
conception of spacetime may effect reconciliation between quantum mechanics and gravity. Castro and 
Granik [37] propose that the world emerged as a result of a nonequilibrium process of self-organized 
critical phenomena launched by vacuum fluctuations in Cantorian–fractal space-time.

2.1. Model predictions 

The model predictions [3, 4, and 38] and the interpretation of quantum mechanical laws as applied to 
macro-scale  fluid  flows  are  described  in  the  following.  It  is  shown  that  the  apparent  paradoxes  of 
quantum mechanics are physically consistent in the context of atmospheric flows. 

(i) Atmospheric flows trace an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory OROR1R2R3R4R5 

simultaneously in clockwise and anti-clockwise directions with the quasi-periodic Penrose 
tiling pattern [39] for the internal structure shown in figure 3 (see attached Appendix). 

Figure 3. The quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern 

 

The  spiral  flow  structure  can  be  visualized  as  an  eddy 
continuum generated by successive length step growths ORO , 
OR1  ,  OR2  ,  OR3  ,….respectively  equal  to  R1  ,  R2  ,  R3 
,….which  follow  Fibonacci  mathematical  series  such  that 
Rn+1  = Rn +  Rn-1  and Rn+1 / Rn = t    where  t   is the  golden 
mean equal to (1+(cid:214)5)/2 ( » 1.618). Considering a normalized 
length  step  equal  to  1  for  the  last  stage  of  eddy  growth,  the 
successively  decreasing  radial  length  steps  can  be  expressed 
as  1,  1/t,  1/t2,  1/t3,  ……The  normalized  eddy  continuum 
comprises of fluctuation length scales 1, 1/t, 1/t2, …….. The 
probability of occurrence is equal to 1/t and 1/t2 respectively 
for  eddy  length  scale  1/t  in  any  one  or  both  rotational 
(clockwise  and  anti-clockwise)  directions.  Eddy  fluctuation 
length of amplitude 1/t, has a probability of occurrence equal 
to  1/t2  in  both  rotational  directions,  i.  e.  the  square  of  eddy 
amplitude represents the probability of occurrence in the eddy 
continuum.  Similar  result  is  observed  in  the  subatomic 
dynamics of quantum systems which are visualized to consist 

of the superimposition of eddy fluctuations in wave trains (eddy continuum). 

Nonlocal connections are intrinsic to quasiperiodic Penrose titling pattern. The phenomenon known 
as nonlocality or “action at a distance” characterize quantum systems. Experiments in quantum optics 
show  that  two  distant  events  can  influence  each  other  instantaneously.  Nonlocal  connections  in 
quantum  systems  apparently  violate  the  fundamental  theoretical  law  in  modern  physics  that  signal 
transmission  cannot  exceed  the  speed  of  light.  The  distinction  between  locality  and  nonlocality  is 
related  to  the  concept  of  a  trajectory  [40]  of  a  single  point  object.  The  instantaneous  nonlocal 
connections in the stringlike energy flow patterns which represent extended objects can be visualized as 
shown in figure 4.

The  circulation  flow  pattern  with  center  O  and  radius  OU  (or  OD)  represents  an  eddy.  In  the 
medium of propagation, namely, atmosphere (air) in this case, upward motion U represents convection 
and  cloud  formation  in  association  simultaneously  with  cloud  dissipation  in  downward  motion  D. 
There  is  an  instantaneous  nonlocal  connection  between  the  phases  of  the  particles  at  U  and  D.  The 
same concept can be applied to an extended object (figure 2) such as a row of clouds represented by the 
wave function y which represents the superimposition of a continuum of eddies. 

In summary, energy pumping at a fundamental frequency generates a broad-band eddy continuum 
and has been observed as chaos in laser and nonlinear optical systems which are basically governed by 
quantum mechanical laws [41]. 

(ii) Conventional continuous periodogram power spectral analyses of such spiral trajectories will 

reveal a continuum of periodicities with progressive increase in phase. 

(iii) The broadband power spectrum will have embedded dominant wavebands the bandwidth 

increasing with period length. The peak periods En in the dominant wavebands will be given by 
the relation

In (4) t is the golden mean equal to (1+(cid:214)5)/2 [@1.618] and Ts is the primary perturbation time period, 
for  example,  the  solar  powered  annual  cycle  (summer  to  winter)  of  solar  heating  in  a  study  of 
interannual climate variability. Ghil [42] reports that the most striking feature in climate variability on 
all  time  scales is the  presence  of  sharp  peaks superimposed  on  a  continuous  background.  The  model 
predicted periodicities are 2.2, 3.6, 5.8, 9.5, 15.3, 24.8, 40.1 and 64.9 years for values of n ranging from 
-1  to 6.  Periodicities  close to  model  predicted  have been reported in  weather  and climate cycles [43, 
44].  

Time  series  analysis  of  global  market  economy  also  exhibits  power  law  behaviour  with  possible 
multifractal structure and has suggested an analogy to fluid turbulence. The stock market can be viewed 
as a self-organizing cooperative system presenting power law distributions, large events in possible co-
existence with synchronized behaviour. The observed power law represents structures similar to 'Elliott 
waves' of technical analysis first introduced in the 1930s. It describes the time series of a stock price as 
made  of  different  waves;  these  waves  are  in  relation  to  each  other  through  the  Fibonacci  series.  The 
'Elliott waves' could be a signature of an underlying critical structure of the stock market [45]. 

(iv) The overall logarithmic spiral flow structure is given by the relation 

In (5) the constant k is the steady  state fractional volume dilution of large eddy by inherent turbulent 
eddy  fluctuations  and  z  is  the  length  scale  ratio  R/r.  The  constant  k  is  equal  to  1/t2  (@  0.382)  and  is 
identified as the universal constant for deterministic chaos in fluid flows. The steady state emergence of 
fractal structures is therefore equal to

The  model  predicted  logarithmic  wind  profile  relationship  such  as  (5)  is  a  long-established 
(observational)  feature  of  atmospheric  flows  in  the  boundary  layer,  the  constant  k,  called  the  Von 
Karman’s  constant  has  the  value  equal  to  0.38  as  determined  from  observations.  Historically,  (5), 
basically  an  empirical  law  known  as  the  universal  logarithmic  law  of  the  wall,  first  proposed  in  the 
early 1930s by pioneering aerodynamicists Theodor von Karman and Ludwig Prandtl, describes shear 
forces  exerted  by  turbulent  flows  at  boundaries  such  as  wings  or  fan  blades  or  the  interior  wall  of  a 
pipe. The law of the wall has been used for decades by engineers in the design of aircraft, pipelines and 
other structures [46]. 

In  (5),  W  represents  the  standard  deviation  of  eddy  fluctuations,  since  W  is  computed  as  the 
instantaneous r. m. s. (root mean square) eddy perturbation amplitude with reference to the earlier step 
of eddy  growth. For two successive stages of eddy  growth  starting from primary perturbation w*, the 
ratio of the standard deviations Wn+1 and Wn is given from (5) as (n+1)/n. Denoting by s the standard 
deviation of eddy fluctuations at the reference level (n=1) the standard deviations of eddy fluctuations 
for  successive  stages  of  eddy  growth  are  given  as  integer  multiples  of s,  i.  e. s,  2s,  3s,  etc.  and 
correspond respectively to

The conventional power spectrum plotted as the variance versus the frequency in log-log scale will 
now  represent  the  eddy  probability  density  on  logarithmic  scale  versus  the  standard  deviation  of  the 
eddy  fluctuations  on  linear  scale  since  the  logarithm  of  the  eddy  wavelength  represents  the  standard 
deviation, i. e. the r. m. s. value of eddy fluctuations (5). The r. m. s. value of eddy fluctuations can be 
represented in terms of statistical normal distribution as follows. A normalized standard deviation t=0 
corresponds  to  cumulative  percentage  probability  density  equal  to  50  for  the  mean  value  of  the 
distribution. Since the logarithm of the wavelength represents the r. m. s. value of eddy fluctuations the 
normalized standard deviation  t  is defined for the eddy energy as 

t

In  (8)  L  is  the  time  period  (or  wavelength)  and  T50  is  the  period  up  to  which  the  cumulative 
percentage contribution to total variance is equal to 50 and t = 0. The function logT50 also represents 
the mean  value for the r. m. s. eddy fluctuations and is consistent  with the concept of the mean level 
represented  by  r.  m.  s.  eddy  fluctuations.  Spectra  of  time  series  of  meteorological  parameters  when 
plotted as cumulative percentage contribution to total variance versus t have been shown to follow the 
model predicted universal spectrum [4] which is identified as a signature of quantumlike chaos.  

(v) Selvam [47] has shown that (1) represents the universal algorithm for deterministic chaos in 
dynamical systems and is expressed in terms of the universal Feigenbaum’s [14] constants a 
and d as follows. The successive length step growths generating the eddy continuum 
OROR1R2R3R4R5 analogous to the period doubling route to chaos (growth) is initiated and 
sustained by the turbulent (fine scale) eddy acceleration w* which then propagates by the 
inherent property of inertia of the medium of propagation. Therefore, the statistical parameters 
mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of the perturbation field in the medium of propagation 
4 respectively. The associated dynamics of the perturbation 
are given by w*, w*
field can be described by the following parameters. The perturbation speed w* (motion) per 
second (unit time) sustained by its inertia represents the mass, w*
the angular momentum or potential energy, and w*
motion has an inherent curvature to its trajectory.  
It is shown that Feigenbaum’s constant  a  is equal to [47]

In (9) the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to two successive stages of eddy growth. Feigenbaum’s constant a as 
defined  above  represents  the  steady  state  emergence  of  fractional  Euclidean  structures.  Considering 
dynamical eddy growth processes, Feigenbaum’s constant a also represents the steady state fractional 
outward mass dispersion rate and a2 represents the energy flux into the environment generated by the 
persistent primary perturbation w* Considering both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations, the total 
energy flux into the environment is equal to 2a2. In statistical terminology, 2a2 represents the variance 
of fractal structures for both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation directions. 

The Feigenbaum’s constant d is shown to be equal to [47]

In  (12) pd,  the  relative  volume  intermittency  of  occurrence  contributes  to  the  total  variance  2a2  of

In  terms  of  eddy  dynamics,  the  above  equation  states  that  during  each  length  step  growth,  the 
energy flux into the environment equal to 2a2 contributes to generate relative spin angular momentum 
equal to pd of the growing fractal structures. 

It was shown at (6) above that the steady state emergence of fractal structures in fluid flows is equal 

to 1/k (= t2) and therefore the Feigenbaum’s constant a is equal to 

(vi) The relationship between Feigenbaum’s constant a and statistical normal distribution for power 

spectra is derived in the following. 

The  steady  state  emergence  of  fractal  structures  is  equal  to  the  Feigenbaum’s  constant  a  (6).  The 
relative  variance  of  fractal  structure  for  each  length  step  growth  is  then  equal  to  a2.  The  normalized 
variance  1/a2n  will  now  represent  the  statistical  normal  probability  density  for  the  nth  step  growth 
according  to  model  predicted  quantumlike  mechanics  for  fluid  flows.  Model  predicted  probability 
density values P are computed as

The steady state emergence of fractal structures for each length step growth for any one direction of

The  moment  coefficient  of  skewness  for  the  fractal  spacetime  structures  is  equal  to  zero  for  the

Therefore  statistical  normal  distribution  characteristics  [48]  are  followed  by  the  probability  P  of

decrease in slope at low frequencies in dynamical systems.

(viii) The fractal dimension D can be expressed as a function of the universal Feigenbaum’s  constant  

a  as follows. 

The steady state emergence of fractal structures is equal to a for each length step growth (7) and (13) 
and  therefore  the  fractal  structure  domain  is  equal  to  am  at  mth  growth  step  starting  from  unit 
perturbation.  Starting  from  unit  perturbation,  the  fractal  object  occupies  spatial  (two  dimensional) 
domain am associated with radial extent tm since successive radii follow Fibonacci number series. The 
fractal dimension D is defined as  

where  M  is  the  mass  contained  within  a  distance    R    from  a  point  in  the  fractal  object.  Considering

The  fractal  dimension  increases  with  the  number  of  growth  steps.  The  dominant  wavebands 
increase  in  length  with  successive  growth  steps.  The  fractal  dimension  D  indicates  the  number  of 
periodicities which superimpose to give the observed four dimensional spacetime structure to the flow 
pattern.  The  above  concept  of  dimension  for  real  world  spacetime  patterns  is  consistent  with  El 
Naschie’s [15] interpretation of dimensions for superstring theories in particle physics, namely a string 
rotates  in  ordinary  space  and  only  uses  the  extra  dimensions  for  vibrations  which  simulate  particle 
masses. Recent theoretical studies [49] show that the four experienced dimensions (three in space and 
one in time) are sufficient to describe the observed physical properties of the universe. El Naschie [15] 
has also derived mathematically and shown that the golden mean is intrinsic to the geometry of fractal 
structures.  The  correlated  fluctuations  of  the  fractal  spacetime  eddy  continuum  are  analogous  to  the 
Bose-Einstein condensation phenomena observed in liquid helium [50 – 53]. 

(ix) The relationship between fine structure constant, i. e. the eddy energy ratio between successive 

dominant eddies and Feigenbaum’s constant a is derived as follows. 

2a2 = relative variance of fractal structure (both clockwise and anticlockwise rotation) for each growth 
step. 

For one dominant large eddy (figure 3) OROR1R2R3R4R5 comprising of five growth steps each for 

clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, the total variance is equal to  
a2 2

(22) 

For  each  complete  cycle  (comprising  of  five  growth  steps  each)  in  simultaneous  clockwise  and 
counterclockwise  rotations,  the  relative  energy  increase  is  equal  to  137.07  and  represents  the  fine 
structure  constant  for  eddy  energy  structure.  The  inverse  of  this  fine  structure  constant  will  then 
represent  the  probability  of  occurrence  of  the  primary  eddy  circulation  (either  clockwise  or  counter-
clockwise) in the dominant large eddy circulation (figure 3) OROR1R2R3R4R5 . 

Incidentally,  the  fine  structure  constant  in  atomic  physics  [54  –  60],  designated  as  a-1,  a 
dimensionless  number  equal  to  137.03604,  is  very  close  to  that  derived  above  for  atmospheric  eddy 
energy structure. This fundamental constant has attracted much attention [61] and it is felt that quantum 
mechanics cannot be interpreted properly until such time as we can derive this physical constant from a 
more basic theory. The laws of physics are in need of a fundamental change [61]. 

(x) The ratio of proton mass M to electron mass me, i. e. M/me is another fundamental 

dimensionless number which also awaits derivation from a physically consistent theory. The 
value of M/me determined by observation is equal to about 2000. In the following it is shown 
that ratio of energy content of large to small eddies for specific length scale ratios is equivalent 
to M/me. 

From (22), the energy ratio for two successive dominant eddy growth = (2a2 x10)2

The above equation also represents the relative upward mass flux (9) for two successive stages of 

dominant eddy growth with respect to inherent primary turbulent eddy. 

The primary circulation corresponds to OROR1 (figure 3) with length scale ORO equal to t5 and the 
dominant large eddy length scale OR5 is then equal to (t5)6 . The length scale ratio OR5 / ORO is equal 
to ( t5 )6 /t5 = t25 @ 105.22 . The ratio of the radii of atom and electron is also approximately equal to 105 
[62]. 

Quantum  mechanical  concepts  relating  to  fundamental  particles  and  universal  constants  are 
summarised in the following [57]. The only objects that appear to be exactly the same everywhere are 
the  atoms  and  their  constituent  particles.  A  natural  unit  of  mass  is  the  nucleon  mass,  equal 
approximately to that of the hydrogen atom. Nucleons (i. e., protons and neutrons) have a mass 1836 
times the mass of the electron.  

The constants of nature can be arranged to form natural numbers (often referred to as dimensionless 
numbers)  that  are  independent  of  our  units  of  measurement.  The  ratio  of  the  nucleon  and  electron 
masses  equal  to  approximately  1836  is  one  such  number.  Another  example  is  the  Sommerfeld’s  fine 
structure constant defined by a

combination of c, h and e indicates a wave like (h) interaction between particles (e) and light (c)

The  classical  electron  radius  is  the  size  of  an  electron  as  calculated  prior  to  the  introduction  of

electrical energy equal to

The  cell  dynamical  system  model  concepts  therefore  enable  physically  consistent  derivation  of 
fundamental  constants  which  define  the  basic  structure  of  quantum  systems.  These  two  fundamental 
constants  could  not  be  derived  so  far  from  a  basic  theory  in  traditional  quantum  mechanics  for 
subatomic dynamics [58]. 

2.2. No scale model for super gravity 
A no scale energy M can be defined for the large eddy energy with respect to the primary eddy energy 
mp [55, 56) as follows 

Since  phenomenological  manifestation  of  energy  occurs  only  during  one  half  cycle  of  eddy 
perturbation, M and mp can be expressed as equal to the eddy mass fluxes across unit cross-section per 
second as follows in terms of the respective large and primary eddy r. m. s circulations speeds W and 
w*.

The above concept is analogous to the no  scale super gravity model of Lahanas and Nanapoulous 
[63]  where  M,  the  super-Planck  mass  is  given  in  terms  of  the  Planck  scale  mp  (»  1019  Gev)  which 
corresponds  to  the  first  excited  state  of  these  strings  [64].  The  virtues  of  the  no  scale  super  gravity 
model  are  automatically  vanishing  cosmological  constant  (at  least  at  the  classical  level),  dynamical 
determination  of all  mass scales  in terms  of  fundamental  Planck  scale  mp  and acceptable  low  energy 
phenomenology.  The  no  scale  structure  is  super  symmetric  since  it  fuses  together  the  non-trivial 
internal symmetries of the internal small scale eddies with the spacetime (Poincare) symmetries of the 
eddy continuum structure and accounts for the observed fractal geometry in nature.  

It is possible to compute and show that the Planck length scale lp is about 20 orders of magnitude 
smaller than the electron length scale le by substituting the known values [62] of mp equal to 2.176×10-5 
gm  and  the  electron  mass  me  equal  to  9.109×10-23  gm  in  (23).  Each  length  step  of  eddy  growth 
corresponds to angular rotation equal to 36 degrees as shown in figure 3 for the quasiperiodic Penrose 
tiling pattern structure traced by the growing large eddy.  Starting from  unit length scale perturbation, 
one  complete  cycle  (360  degrees)  of  eddy  growth  consists  of  10  length  steps  and  results  in  a  final 
length  scale equal to t10, the successive length  scales following  the  Fibonacci number  series.  Let  the 
primary Planck length scale eddy perturbation of length scale lp equal to t10 generate the electron length 
scale le eddy perturbation after ne number of cyclical growth steps. The length scale ratio zep of electron 
with respect to the primary eddy cycle corresponding to Planck length scale is represented by ne and is 
equal to about 21 as shown in the following.

Penrose [61] has discussed the mysterious aspects of the observed mass problem in particle physics, 
namely  the  macroscopic  Planck  mass  (2.176×10-5  gm)  is  associated  with  length  scale  20  orders  of 
magnitude  smaller  than  the  tiniest  length  scales  encountered  in  particle  physics  such  as  that  of  the 
electron.  The  above  derivation  shows  that  the  Planck  distance  of  1.6163·10-33  cm  [62]  is  some  20 
orders of magnitude smaller than the electron length scale consistent with model concepts (23). 

The string theory visualizes particles as extended objects and thereby avoids singularities, a major 

problem in the application of point-like concept for particles in traditional physics [65]. 

The string theory for quantumlike mechanics in atmospheric flows is analogues to Bohm’s concept 

of implicate order for subatomic dynamics of quantum systems [66].  

The  cell  dynamical  system  model  described  above  is  basically  a  string  theory  applicable  to  all 
dynamical systems ranging from macro-scale atmospheric flows to subatomic scale quantum systems. 
The  four-dimensional  real  world  spacetime  continuum  fluctuation  are  manifestation  of  the 
superimposition  of  a  hierarchical  continuum  of  eddy  circulations  (vortices  within  vortices),  whose 
centripetal  acceleration  add  cumulatively  to  represent  the  inertial  mass,  which  is  equivalent  to 
gravitational  mass.  Recent  studies  [67]  show  that  in  a  strong  magnetic  field,  electrons  swirl  around 
magnetic  field  lines,  creating  a  vortex.  Under  right  conditions,  a  vortex  can  couple  to  an  electron, 
acting as a single unit. Vortex geometrical structure is ubiquitous in macro-scale as well as microscopic 
subatomic  dynamical  fluctuation  patterns.  Inside  a  superconductor,  electrical  currents  flow  without 
resistance. Almost as remarkable as this electron flow without dissipation are the quantized thread-like-
vortices of charge that swirl like miniature tornadoes around lines of magnetic field [68]. 

2.3. Cantorian fractal spacetime, quantum-like chaos and scale relativity in atmospheric flows 

Cantorian  fractal  spacetime  fluctuations  characterize  quantumlike  chaos  in  atmospheric  flows.  The 
macroscale  atmospheric  flow  structure  behaves  as  a  unified  whole  quantum  system,  where,  the 
superimposition  of  a  continuum  of  eddies  results  in  the  observed  global  weather  patterns  with  long-
range  spatiotemporal  correlations  such  as  that  of  the  widely  investigated  El  Nino  phenomenon  [3]. 
Large  eddies  are  visualised  as  envelopes  enclosing  smaller  eddies,  thereby  generating  a  hierarchy  of 
eddy circulations, originating initially from a fixed primary small scale energising perturbation, e.g. the 
frictional upward momentum flux at the boundary layer of the earth's surface. In the following sections 
it is shown that the relative motion concepts of Einstein's special and general theories of relativity are 
applicable to eddy circulations originating from a constant primary perturbation. 

2.4. Physical concepts in spacetime relativity 

The equations of motion enunciated by Newton in 1687 [69] were believed to describe nature correctly 
for over 200 years. The ideas of Newton involve the assumption that the laws of motion, and indeed all 
the  laws  of  physics,  are  the  same  for  an  observer  at  "rest"  as  for  an  observer  moving  with  uniform 
velocity with respect to the "rest" system. This symmetry principle is sometimes called the principle of 
relativity.  The  principle  of  relativity  in  Newton's and Einstein's theories  of  mechanics  differs  only  in 
the  way that the speed  of the observer affects  observations of positions and times in the two theories 
[26]. If an inertial reference system is defined as one in which Newton's laws describe the behavior of 
bodies, any other reference system, which moves with constant velocity with respect to this first inertial 
system, is also an inertial system. Time and space seem to be independent of the particular frame used 
[70]. The concept of relativity (Galilean), a symmetry principle, has been used in mechanics for a long 
time. By symmetry is meant an invariance against change, something stays the same in spite of some 
potentially  consequential  alteration  [71].  Investigations  into  the  phenomenon  of  electricity  and 
magnetism  culminated  in  1860  in  Maxwell's  equations  of  the  electromagnetic  field,  which  describe 
electricity, magnetism and light in one uniform system. However during the period 1890 - 1905 it was 
recognized that Maxwell equations did not seem to obey the inherent symmetries present in the laws of 
motion  of  Galileo  and  Newton.  One  of  the  consequences  of  Maxwell's  equations  is  that  if  there  is 
disturbance in the field such that light is generated, these electromagnetic waves go out in all directions 
equally at the same speed c, equal to about 3·105 km/sec. Another consequence of the equations is that 

14

 

 

 

 

 

A M Selvam 

if  the source  of the disturbance is  moving, the light emitted  goes through  space at the  same  speed  c. 
This  is  analogous  to  the  case  of  sound,  the  speed  of  sound  waves  being  likewise  independent  of  the 
motion of the source [72]. Incidentally, the constant c happened to be first discovered by workers in the 
field of electricity, long before electromagnetic waves were known to exist [69]. 

A  number  of  experiments  based  on  the  general  idea  of  Galilean  relativity  were  performed  to 
determine the speed of light. Michelson and Morley, in 1887 found that the velocity of a beam of light 
moving from east to west is the same as that of a beam of light moving from north to south. The east-
west velocity might have been expected to be influenced by the velocity of the earth, but such was not 
the case. About 20 years later, H. A. Lorentz provided the solution by suggesting that material bodies 
contract when they are moving and that this foreshortening is only in the direction of the motion and 
also that if the length is Lo when body is at rest, then when it moves with speed u parallel to its length, 
the new length L1 is given as  

2

 

u
c
Although  the  contraction  hypothesis  successfully  accounted  for  the  negative  result  of  the 
experiment, it was open to the objection that it was invented for the express purpose of explaining away 
the difficulty and was too artificial [72]. The contraction in length is concomitant with modification in 
time elapsed by the factor

i. e., moving clocks run slower. 

Based  on the  above hypothesis  of linear contraction  and time  dilation  in  moving  objects,  Lorentz 
showed  that  Maxwell's  equations  retain  their  symmetry,  i.  e.  remain  unchanged  when  the  following 
Lorentz transformations are applied.

Lorentz's  transformations  introduced  into  the  laws  of  mechanics,  the  speed  of  light,  basically  an 

electromagnetic constant. 

The corresponding Galilean transformations are

These equations relate the space and time coordinates (x, y, z and t) of a system at rest to those (x', 

y', z', and t') of a system in uniform relative motion of speed u in the x direction. 

Einstein, following a suggestion originally made by Poincare, then proposed in his special theory of 
relativity that all physical laws should be  of such a kind that they remain unchanged under a Lorentz 
transformation [72]. Applying Lorentz transformations to Newton's laws of motion, Einstein, in 1905, 
showed that the mass m in Newton's laws of motion should now be written as

In the above equation m0 is the rest mass and c is the speed of light equal to about 3·105 km sec-1. 
Einstein's  special  theory  of  relativity  proposed  in  1905  introduced  modification  of  laws  of  motion, 
related to how physical observers measure spatial displacements and time intervals. 

The two basic postulates of Einstein's special theory of relativity are as follows [70]. 
(i) The laws of electrodynamics and of mechanics are the same in all inertial frames. This includes 

the requirement that c, the velocity of light in free space, is invariant. 

(ii) It is impossible to devise an experiment, which defines a state of absolute motion. There is no 

special "rest" frame of reference. 

2.5. Special relativity to general relativity 

After  proposing  the  special  theory  of  relativity,  Einstein  discovered  that  the  inverse  square  law  of 
gravitation  could  not  co-exist  consistently  with  the  special  theory  of  relativity  [73,  74].  One  of  the 
major achievements of the special theory of relativity was the demonstration that the speed of light is a 
constant  and  imposes  a  limit  to  the  maximum  attainable  speed  of  any  material  object  or 
electromagnetic wave. This limiting speed c plays a crucial role in relating spacetime measurements of 
inertial observers, i. e. observers moving under no forces. The gravitational attraction as postulated by 
Newton  clearly  exceeded  this  speed  limit,  since  it  was  instantaneous.  Further,  the  phenomenon  of 
gravity  prevents  us  from  defining  the  inertial  observers  in  the  first  place.  The  inertial  observers  so 
fundamental to special relativity do not exist because of ever-present force of gravity. 

In his general theory of relativity proposed in 1915, Einstein gave an ingenious interpretation to this 
property  of  gravity.  Realizing that  gravity is  permanently  attached to  space, he  argued  that  it, in  fact 
describes  an intrinsic  property  of  space and time,  viz.  its  geometry.  The  geometry  of space  and time 
must  be  of  a  curved  non-Euclidean  type,  i.  e.  spacetime  is  curved.  By  treating  spacetime  as  curved 
Einstein eliminated gravity as a physical force. In his general theory of relativity Einstein gave a set of 
equations, which relate the geometrical properties of spacetime to the distribution of gravitating matter 
within it. Special relativity brought into physics the important notion that space and time together form 
a  joint  entity.  The  measurements  of  spatial  distances  and  time  intervals  in  the  special  theory  are 
performed  according  to  flat  space  geometry.  The  notion  of  curvature  of  spacetime  and  its  relation  to 
gravity is the remarkable new feature of the general theory. 

There  is  only  a  minute  difference  between  the  predictions  of  general  relativity  and  Newtonian

gravity [73, 74]. 

physical laws. 

3. Scale relativity and fractal spacetime structures in atmospheric flows 

Dynamical systems in nature exhibit selfsimilar spacetime fractal fluctuations of all scales down to the 
microscopic  scales  of  the  subatomic  world,  i.  e.  the  vacuum  zero  point  energy  fluctuations. 
Selfsimilarity  implies  long-range  correlations,  i.  e.  nonlocal  connections  in  space  and  time.  The 
ubiquitous  fractal  spacetime  structures  found  in  nature  imply  a  self-organization  or  self-assembly 
process  which  is  independent of  microscopic details  such as physical, chemical, physiological,  etc  of 
the  dynamical  system.  The  cell  dynamical  system  model  for  atmospheric  flows  proposed  by  Selvam 
and Fadnavis [4, 5] may be directly applicable to all dynamical systems in general and in particular to 
the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems (Section 2.1). The model is based on the concept [17] that 
spacetime integration of enclosed small-scale (turbulent) fluctuations results in the formation of large-
scale (eddy) circulations (figure 1.). 

Large eddies are visualized as envelopes enclosing inherent small scale eddies, thereby generating a 
continuum of eddies, the spatial integration at each level generating the next level (large scale) and so 
on. The relationship between the root mean square (r. m. s.) circulation speeds W and w* respectively of 
large and small eddies and their respective radii R and r is given as (1)

The  primary  perturbation  w*  is  constant  and  generates  a  continuum  of  eddies  of  progressively 
increasing radii R. The r. m. s. circulation speed W at each level represents the mean as well as standard 
deviation, i. e. it is a relative velocity with respect to the constant generating perturbation w*  
Therefore the factor

in the Lorentz transformation at (24) becomes equal to 1, since the relative velocity u = 0. Also, w* is 
equivalent  to  c  and  is  a  constant  primary  perturbation.  The  Lorentz  transformations  when  applied  to 
eddy dynamics reduce to classical mechanics of Galileo and Newton, since, by concept the eddy r. m. s. 
circulation speeds W are relative to the constant primary perturbation speed w*.  

Einstein's principles of special relativity and general relativity are applicable to eddy dynamics as 

summarized in the model predictions [4, 5] in the following 

(i) Spacetime fractal structures are signatures of string like energy flow in a hierarchy of vortices 
tracing an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory with the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern for 
the internal structure. 

(ii) The logarithmic spiral energy flow structure can be resolved as a continuum of eddy 

circulations, which follow Kepler's laws of planetary motion, in particular the third law. The 
inertial masses of eddies representing gravitational masses, therefore follow Newton's inverse 
square law of gravitation. Fractal spacetime fluctuations are related to gravity and is consistent 
with El Naschie's [15] conjecture that gravity is caused by 'fractal' fluctuations of time. 

(iii) Instantaneous non-local connection, prohibited in Einstein's special theory of relativity, is 

possible and consistent in the context of eddy circulations which are considered as extended 
objects as explained in the following. The bidirectional energy flow intrinsic to eddy 
circulations is associated with bimodal, i. e. formation and dissipation respectively of 
phenomenological form for manifestation of energy such as the formation of clouds in updrafts 
associated with simultaneous dissipation of clouds in adjacent downdrafts, thereby generating 
discrete cellular geometry to cloud structure. 

Gravitation is defined as a property of spacetime geometry in Einstein's general theory of relativity. 
The  concept  of  pointlike  particle  of  zero  dimensions  in  classical  physics  introduces  infinities  or 
singularities in the smooth spacetime fabric representing gravitational field. Further, pointlike particles 
are  associated  with  trajectories,  where,  the  speed  of  the  particle  cannot  exceed  the  speed  of  light 
according to Einstein's special theory of relativity. 

The cell dynamical system model [4, 5] discussed in this section introduces the concept of extended 

objects thereby avoiding singularities and also possessing instantaneous nonlocal connection. 

Cantorian fractal spacetime structure to atmospheric flow patterns is a result of the superposition of 
a continuum of eddies, which function as a unified whole quantum system. Wave-particle duality in the 
quantum  system  of  atmospheric  flows  is  a  result  of  bimodal  (formation  and  dissipation)  form  for 
manifestation  of  energy  in  the  bidirectional  energy  flow  intrinsic  to  eddy  circulations,  such  as  the 
formation  of  clouds  in  updrafts  and  dissipation  of  clouds  in  adjacent  downdrafts,  manifested  in  the 
common place occurrence of clouds in a row (figures. 2 and 4). 

The  eddy  circulations  follow  Kepler's  laws  of  planetary  motion,  in  particular,  the  third  law  and 
therefore  Newton's  inverse  square  law  for  gravitation  is  applicable  to  eddy  masses.  The  root  mean 
square  (r.  m.  s)  circulation  speeds  of  the  eddies  are  relative  to  and  less  than  the  primary  constant 
perturbation. Therefore, the basic criteria invoked in Einstein's special and general theories of relativity 
are incorporated in the concept for  generation of eddy continuum. It is possible that the vacuum zero 
point electromagnetic field fluctuations, may  self-organize to generate particles such as  the electrons, 
protons etc., in a manner similar to the formation of atmospheric eddy continuum. The vacuum may be 
a permanent nonzero source of energy in the universe [76]. 

In summary, quantum mechanical laws, which govern the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems 
such as the photon or electron, are shown to be applicable to macro-scale fluid flow dynamics. The cell 
dynamical  system  model  for  turbulent  fluid  flows  developed  by  the  author  shows  that  quantum 
mechanical laws are applicable to the energy structure of atmospheric weather systems. Some of the yet 
unresolved problems of quantum mechanics for the subatomic domain are now shown to be physically 
consistent commonplace observational facts in the context  of atmospheric eddy dynamics as listed in 
the  following:  (i)  wave-particle  duality  is  inherent  to  the  bi-directional  eddy  energy  circulation  and 
corresponds to the bimodal (formation and dissipation respectively) phenomenological form for energy 
display, e.g. cloud formation and dissipation respectively in adjacent updraft and downdraft regions in

atmospheric flows. Such a concept may possibly explain the essentially  wave-like  polarization of the 
particle-like  quanta  of  electromagnetic  radiation  (ii)  spirality  or  spin  is  intrinsic  to  the  bi-directional 
eddy energy flow, the coupled system of updrafts and downdrafts having opposite spins are analogous 
to  the  electron-positron  pair  of  the  subatomic  domain  (iii)  instantaneous  non-local  response  and 
adjustment  occurs  between  the  spatially  separated  domains  of  the  low  and  high  pressure  centers 
respectively  of the  updraft and downdraft  regions  because  of  the continuity  of each  eddy  circulation, 
the downdraft being an instantaneous response to the updraft thereby satisfying Newton’s third law of 
motion. The instantaneous non-local connection (action at a distance) between the two streams of the 
bi-directional energy flow of each individual eddy circulation is also responsive to eddy circulations in 
all the other scales because of the co-existence of all the scales of eddies in the unified eddy continuum 
(overall  environment)  with  implicit  ordered  energy  flow  between  all  the  scales.  The  analogous  non-
local  effects  of  quantum  mechanics  for  the  subatomic  phenomena  appear  as  paradoxes  and 
inconsistencies in  the absence  of the  concept  of the  unified eddy  energy  structure.  The instantaneous 
non-local connection (or action at a distance) is seen in the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the response of 
each individual eddy circulation to the overall environment is seen as the Berry’s phase. Such non-local 
connections  known  as  entanglement  is  a  quantum  correlation  between  various  parts  of  a  quantum 
system and is required for processing information [77] (iv) vertical dipole charging of clouds occur in 
the micro-scale (turbulence) by horizontal convergence field which coincides with the magnetic field of 
the vertical dipole current, the plane containing the electric and magnetic field being at right angles to 
the direction of propagation of the large eddy. Therefore the atmospheric large eddy circulations give 
rise to electromagnetic waves in regions of cloud formation [78]. The magnetic field may therefore be 
identified  with  the  horizontal  convergence  (divergence)  field  generated  by  the  turbulent  up  (down) 
drafts.  The  atmospheric  eddy  energy  structure  follows  quantum  mechanical  laws  and  therefore 
quantum mechanical and stochastic concepts may be beneficially used in the study of the formation and 
dynamics  of  weather  systems.  Observational  results  of  deterministic  chaos  in  laser  emission  may  be 
directly applicable to the evolution of atmospheric eddies, i. e. weather patterns [79, 80]. 

4. Conclusions 
Meteorologists  and  climatologists  have  largely  ignored  self-organized  criticality  (SOC),  a  leading 
candidate  for  a  unified  theory  of  complexity.  Theories  of  complexity,  such  as  SOC,  have  been 
underrepresented  in  the  atmospheric  sciences  because  of  their  “soft  science”  character.  Atmospheric 
sciences  have  historically  developed  from  centuries  of  advancement  in  the  hard  sciences,  such  as 
physics, mathematics and chemistry, etc. It would have been unlikely to see a quick transition from the 
classical reductionist and reproducible science approach towards an abstract, holistic and probabilistic 
complex science [2]. 

The general systems theory described in this paper for the observed self-organized criticality (SOC) 
is applicable to dynamical systems of all size scales from the microscopic scale subatomic dynamics of 
quantum  systems  to  macroscale  atmospheric  flows.  The  model  shows  that  quantum  mechanical  laws 
and  gravitational  forces  are  a  direct  consequence  of  the  fractal  structure  to  space-time  continuum 
fluctuations in dynamical systems of all scales. The idea of using fractal curves in quantum mechanics 
seems to go back to the work of R. Feynman on path integrals [5]. 

The author is grateful to Dr. A. S. R. Murty for his keen interest and encouragement during the course 
of this study.

The turbulent eddy  circulation speed and radius increase  with the  progressive  growth of the large

During  each  length  step  growth  dR,  the  small-scale  energizing  perturbation  Wn  at  the  nth  instant

The angular  turning  dq inherent  to eddy  circulation  for each  length step  growth is equal  to  dR/R. 
The perturbation dR is generated by the small-scale acceleration Wn at any instant n and therefore dR = 
Wn. Starting with the unit value for dR the successive  Wn, Wn+1, R, and dq values are computed from

It is seen that the successive values of the circulation speed W and radius R of the growing turbulent 
eddy follow the Fibonacci mathematical number series such that Rn+1 = Rn + Rn-1 and Rn+1/Rn is equal to 
the  golden  mean t,  which  is  equal  to  [(1  +(cid:214)5)/2]  @  (1.618).  Further,  the  successive  W  and  R  values 
form  the  geometrical  progression  RO  (1  + t  + t2  + t3  + t4  +  ....)  where  RO  is  the  initial  value  of  the 
turbulent eddy radius.  

Turbulent eddy growth from primary perturbation ORO starting from the origin O (figure 3) gives 
rise to compensating return circulations OR1R2 on either side of ORO, thereby generating the large eddy 
radius  OR1  such  that  OR1/ORO  = t  and  ROOR1  = p/5  =  ROR1O.  Therefore,  short-range  circulation 
balance  requirements  generate  successively  larger  circulation  patterns  with  precise  geometry  that  is 
governed  by  the  Fibonacci  mathematical  number  series,  which  is  identified  as  a  signature  of  the 
universal period doubling route to chaos in fluid flows, in particular atmospheric flows. It is seen from 
figure  3  that  five  such  successive  length  step  growths  give  successively  increasing  radii  OR1,  OR2, 
OR3, OR4 and OR5 tracing out one complete vortex-roll circulation such that the scale ratio OR5/ORO is 
equal  to t5  =  11.1.  The  envelope  R1R2R3R4R5  (figure  3)  of  a  dominant  large  eddy  (or  vortex  roll)  is 
found to fit the logarithmic spiral  R = RO ebq where  RO = ORO , b= tan a  with a the  crossing angle 
equal to p/5, and  the angular  turning q  for each  length  step  growth is equal  to p/5. The  successively 
larger eddy radii may be subdivided again in the golden mean ratio. The internal structure of large-eddy 
circulations  is,  therefore,  made  up  of  balanced  small-scale  circulations  tracing  out  the  well-known 
quasi-periodic  Penrose  tiling  pattern  identified  as  the  quasi-crystalline  structure  in  condensed  matter 
physics. A complete description of the atmospheric flow field is given by the quasi-periodic cycles with 
Fibonacci winding numbers.

Abstract 

   We have developed a new design of a GEM-like detector with single-layer electrodes 
made of a resistive kapton. This detector can operate at gains close to 105 even in pure Ar 
and Ne and if transited to discharges at higher gains they, due to the high resistivity of 
electrodes, do not damage either the detector or the front-end electronics. Gains ~ 106 can 
be achieved in a cascaded mode of the operation. The detector can operate without gain 
degradation at counting rates up to 104Hz/cm2 and thus it could be very useful in many 
applications which require safe high gain operation, for example in RICH, TPCs, 
calorimetric. 

 

1. Introduction 
 
   Recently  developed  hole-  type  gaseous  detectors  [1-6]  open  new  possibilities  in  the 
detection of photons and particles, for example they can   operate at relatively high gains 
in poorly quenches gas mixtures and gases (see for example [4, 5, 7]). The most popular 
hole-  type  detector  today  is  the  so  called  Gas  Electron  Multiplier  (GEM)  suggested  by 
Sauli [3]. Cascaded GEM structures are now accepted for several large scales high energy 
physics experiments [8]. 
   In spite of a great progress in the development and optimization of the GEM it is still a 
rather fragile detector, for example it requires very clean and dust free conditions during 
its manufacturing and assembling process and could be easily damaged by sparks which 
are almost unavoidable at high gain operations. Studies performed earlier by us indicated 
that  the  maximum  achievable  gain  of  the  hole-  type  detectors  increased  with  their 
thickness  [9].  Based  on  these  studies  we  have  developed  so  a  called  a  “thick  GEM” 
(TGEM) [5, 6, 10]: a metallized from both sides printed circuit board (thickness of 0.5-
1.5 mm) with drilled -through holes. This detector allows one to achieve the maximum 
gain of almost 10 times higher than with the conventional GEM [6]. Later we modified 
this detector by drilling out a Cu layer around each hole; this allowed one to additionally 
increase  the  maximum  achievable  gain  by  a  factor  of  ~5.  A  systematic  study  of  this 
device  and  its  further  improvements  were  performed  by  Breskin’s  group:  instead  of 
drilling  out  the  Cu  around  the  edges  of  the  holes,  they  manufactured  the  protective 
dielectric rims by a lithographic technology [11]. Recently we have developed and tested 
a  TGEM  with  electrodes  coated  by  a  thick  layer  of  graphite  paint  [12].  We  named  this 
detector a Resistive Electrode Thick GEM or RETGEM. The RETGEMT could operate 
at gains of ~105; at higher gains it may transit to a streamer mode, however in contrast to 
violent sparks in conventional GEMs these streamers are mild and did not damage either 
the  detector  or  the  front-end  electronics.  Certainly  there  is  nothing  special  in  graphite 

coating and many other resistive materials could be used to achieve the same protective 
effect.  The  most  important  in  manufacturing  such  types  of  detectors  is  to  use  a 
lithographic  technology  which  ensures  high  quality  and  reproducibility  of  resistive 
coatings in  large scale  of  productions. In the stream  of  such  efforts  we  have  developed 
RETGEMs  in  which  Cu  or  Cr  electrodes  were  coated  by  CuO  or  CrO  resistive  layers 
[13].    Due  to  the  small  thickness,  this  coating  did  not  provide  full  spark  protection*, 
however the detector gained more robustness compared to the TGEM. 
Both of these RETGEM designs had double- layer electrodes structures: a thin Cu layer 
and a resistive layer on its top.  
   The aim of this work is to build and test first prototypes of RETGEMs manufactured by 
the lithographic technology with electrodes made of single- layer resistive materials. 
 
 
2. Detector’s Design and Experimental Set Up 
 
The  detectors  studied  in  this  work  were  manufactured  from  standard  printed  circuit 
boards (PCBs) having a thickness of 1, 1.6 or 2.4 mm. On the both surfaces of the PCB 
sheets  of  resistive  kapton  100XC10E5  50μm  thick  were  glued  (the  glue  FR4).  The 
surface resistivity of this material depending on a particular sample may vary from 500 to 
800 kΩ/□. The holes were drilled by a CNC machine as was done earlier in the case of 
TGEM; they were 0.8 mm in diameter, the pitch was 1.2 mm and the active area of the 
detector  was  30x30  mm2.  A  Cu  frame  was  manufactured  by  a  photolithographic 
technique  in  the  surrounding  area  of  the  detector  in  order  to  provide  good  electrical 
contacts with the HV and signal cables-see Fig.1.

* The efficiency of the spark quenching depends on the amount of surface charge from the incoming 
avalanche that is needed to substantially modify the field in the gap quenching the discharge, or in other 
words, the resistive layer capacity per unit area. This will be high if the layer is thin or if the dielectric 
constant is high.  
 

Unfortunately, not all detectors manufactured by this simple technology (we called them” 
first  prototypes”)  were  perfect:  some  holes  contained  micropartcles  and  microwires  of 
caption  remaining  after  the  drilling.  To  avoid  these  defects  we  slightly  changed  the 
manufactured technology:  prior to drilling we glued on the top of the kapton sheets a Cu 
foil  35  μm  thick-  see  Fig.  2.  After  the  drilling  process  was  finished  the  Cu  foils  were 
etched in the active area of the detector and only a Cu frame for the connection of the HV 
wires was preserved in the periferical part of the detector –see Fig. 2. This modification 
allows  one  to  achieve  an  excellent  quality  of  all  the  holes.  We  called  the  detectors 
manufactured by this technology “improved prototypes.”

 It  consists  of  a  gas  chamber  inside  which  one  or  two  RETGEMs  operating  in  cascade 
mode  were  installed  and  a  gas  system  allowing  the  flushing  though  the  chamber  of 
various gases. Most of the tests were performed in Ar, Ar+20%CO2 or in Ne at pressure 
of 1atm. Ionization of the gas was produces either by a 241 Am alpha source or by a 55Fe 
X-ray source. The signals from the detector were recorded by a charge sensitive amplifier 
CANBERRA and then, if necessary, additionally amplified by a research amplifier. 
 
 
3. Results 
 
 
3.1. Results Obtained with First Prototypes 
 
   Fig.  4  shows  gain  vs.  voltage  measured  in  the  case  of  the  first  prototype  1mm  thick 
operating in pure Ne. Measurements were performed using  241Am at low gains and  55Fe 
at  high  gains.  One  can  see  that  in  the  case  of  the  55Fe  source  gains  close  to  105  were 
achieved.  At  higher  gains  the  detector  transited  to  mild  streamers  which  did  not  harm 
either  the  detector  or  the  preamplifier.    In  Ar  which  requires  much  higher  voltages  this 
detector at a gain of ~104 transited to a continuous discharge and the visual observation 
shows that the discharge was caused by the kapton microwires stick out from one of the 
imperfect  holes.  However,  this  continuous  discharge  was  not  harmful  as  well.  In  some 
cases  the  discharge  triggered  by  the  debris  inside  the  holes  could  propagate  along  the 
surface toward the surrounding Cu frame (surface streamers).

achieved in Ne and ~104 in Ar and in Ar+20%CO2. 
 It higher gains streamer type of discharges appeared which may transit to a continuous 
discharge  with  a  further  increase  of  the  voltage.  None  of  these  discharges  were 
distractive.

3.2. Results with Improved Prototypes 
 
  The improved designs of RETGEM allowed us to achieve gains 5-7 times higher than 
with the first prototypes (see Fig. 7 and 8). At gains close to and above 105, due to the 
strong  space  charge  effect  in  the  avalanche  development,  the  detector  began  losing    its 
prortionality and, as in the Geiger counters, the pulses from the detector had a tendency 
to become equal in amplitudes (see Fig. 9 and 10). A percentage of the pulses began to be 
accompanied  by  their  successors  (see  Fig.  11  and  12).  If  discharges  appeared  at  higher 
gains they were mostly confined inside the holes. However, if one continues to increase 
the  voltage  applied  to  the  detector  some  of  them  may  transit  to  surface  streamers 
propagated towards the Cu frame.  
   Fig. 13 shows signal amplitude as a function of the counting rate measures in Ar. No 
surface  charging  up  effect  was  observed  up  to  counting  rated  of  104Hz/cm2  -  the 
maximum counting rate available from our 55Fe source. 

    In the next series of experiments we tested double RETGEM operating in the cascaded 
mode (see Fig. 2). Some results are presented in Fig.14. In this figure the overall gains is 
plotted as a function of the positive voltage applied to the bottom RETGEM for three

that  gains  close  to  106  were  achieved  with  the  double  step  RETGEMs.  In  Ar  at  higher 
gains discharges between two RETGEMs may appear triggered by the initial discharge in 
one of the holes of the bottom RETGEM. As in previous cases, none of these discharges 
damaged the detector.   For example, for several cases we initiated continuous discharges 

in the holes and between the RETGEM for the total duration of 10 min- see the photo.

4. Discussion and Conclusions 
 
   For  the  first  time  in  this  work  we  have  developed  and  successfully  tested  GEM  –like 
detectors  with  electrodes  made  of  single  -layer  resistive  material.  Measurements  show 
that these detectors allow one to reach only slightly higher gains than with TGEM or with 
double-  layer  RETGEMs.  This  is  because  in  all  of  these  detectors  the  transition  to  the 
discharges occurs when the Raether limit is met at: 

An0~108 electrons, 
where A is the gas gain and n0 is the number of primary electrons created in the gas by 
the radioactive source (see [9] for more details). 
  However,  in  contrast  to  GEMs  or  TGEMs  where  sparks  may  cause  fatal  destructions, 
the single- layer RETGEMs were fully spark protected. 
An  interesting  effect  was  observed  during  these  studies:    the  discharges  created  in  the 
holes of the RETGEM may propagate along the kapton surface to the Cu frame. Similar 
surface streamers were observed by us earlier in the case of microstrip gaseous detectors 
[14,  15].  Studies  show  that  surface  streamers  can  easily  propagate  along  dielectric 
surfaces  on  large  distances  even  in  rather  weak  electric  fields  [15,  16].  We  are  now 
developing  another  design  of  the  RETGEMS  in  which  the  surface  steamers  will  be 
strongly suppressed. 
It was also observed in this work that in the case of the double RETGEMs operating in 
pure Ar and Ne the discharge in the hole of the bottom RETGEM may trigger discharges 
between  the  RETGEMs.  Similar  effects  were  observed  earlier  in  the  case  of  double 
GEMs  and  this  phenomena  is  well  understood  today  (see  for  example  [17,  18]  and 
references  therein).  This  type  of  discharge  could  be  avoided  by  the  optimization  of  the 
voltages  applied  to  the  top  and  bottom  RETGEMs  as  well  as  decreasing  the  voltage 
between the RETGEMs (or increasing the distance between them) [17]. 
In  conclusion,  we  would  like  note  that  achieved  gains  105-106  are  sufficient  for  most 
applications.  The  RETGEM  is  very  robust,  can  be  assembled  in  dusty  conditions,  does 
not require special cleanness of it surfaces or the gas chamber and the gas system and can 
operate in poorly quenched gases. 
Thus we believe that RETGEMs could be very useful in many applications which require 
safe and high gain operations, for example in RICH, TPCs, calorimetry, etc. Certainly, 
other resistive coatings could be used as well and the work for their search and study will 
be the subject of our future projects.

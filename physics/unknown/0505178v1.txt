Abstract:  This  paper  studies  the  correlations  of  the  average  winnings  of  agents  and  the  volatilities  of 
systems based on mix-game model which is an extension of minority game (MG). In mix-game, there are 
two groups of agents; group1 plays the majority game, but the group2 plays the minority game. The results 
show  that  the  correlations  between  the  average  winnings  of  agents  and  the  mean  of  local  volatilities  are 
different with different combinations of agents’ memory lengths when the proportion of agents in group1 
increases.  The  average  winnings  of  agents  can  represent  the  average  individual  performance  and  the 
volatility  of  a  system  can  represent  the  efficiency  of  the  system.  Therefore,  these  results  imply  that  the 
combinations of agents’ memory lengths largely influence the relation between the system efficiency and 
the average individual performance. These results could give some guidance in designing complex systems.

Introduction:   

 
 

Systems  consisting  of  heterogeneous  agents  who  compete  constantly  for  limited  resources,  such  as 
different species in an ecological system, traders in financial markets, drivers on city roads and highways or 
users accessing a computer network – raise problems of coordination. All agents in such systems want to 
optimize their performances by making decisions based on available information and their strategies, and 
individual  goals  will  most  certainly  be  conflicting.  A  designer  or  a  manager  outside  such  a  system  may 
hope to balance the individual performance and the efficiency of the system. He or she need to know the 
relationship between the individual performance and the efficiency of the system in order to reach his or 
her  goal.  However,  the  interplay  between  the  state  of  optimal  individual  performance  and  the  reach  of  a 
globally efficient phase where the collective use of resources is optimal may be quite subtle [1]. Therefore, 
the study of this issue has both theoretical and practical importance, which can reveal how the macroscopic 
properties of a system may emerge from the microscopic interaction of agents and under which conditions, 

and this understanding may help for designing of complex systems.   

Agent-based models can be used to address directly the relation between microscopic behavior of agents 
and  macroscopic  properties  of  a  system  (like  fluctuations,  predictability  and  efficiency)  [1].  The  average 
winnings  of  agents  can  represent  the  average  individual  performance  and  the  volatility  of  a  system  can 
represent  the  efficiency  of  the  system.  Therefore,  in  this  paper,  I  study  this  issue  by  examining  the 
correlations of the average winnings of agents and the volatilities of systems based on mix-game model [2] 
which is an extension of minority game (MG) [3, 4, 5]. 

The structure of this paper is as following. Section 2 describes the mix-game model and the simulation 
conditions. Section 3 presents the simulation results, the calculation results of the quantitative correlations 
and  relevant  discussion.  Section  4  gives  some  suggestions  for  potential  applications  of  the  results.  In 
section 5, the conclusion is reached. 

2.  Mix-game model: 

The MG comprises an odd number of agents choosing repeatedly between the options of buying (1) and 
selling  (0)  a  quantity  of  a  risky  asset.  The  agents  continually  try  to  make  the  minority  decision  i.e.  buy 
assets when the majority of other agents are selling and sell when the majority of other agents are buying. 
Mix-game  model  is  an  extension  of  MG,  so  its  structure  is  similar  to  MG.  In  mix-game,  there  are  two 
groups  of  agents;  group1  plays  the  majority  game  [6,  7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12,  13],  but  the  group2  plays  the 
minority game. N (odd number) is the total number of the agents and N1 is number of agents in group1. 
The system resource is r = N*L, where L<1 is the proportion of resource of the system. All agents compete 
in the system for the limited resource r. T1 and T2 are the time horizon lengths of the two groups, and m1 
and m2 denote the memory lengths of the two groups, respectively.     

The global information only available to the agents is a common bit-string “memory” of the m1 or m2 
most recent competition outcomes (1 or 0). A strategy consists of a response, i.e., 0 (sell) or 1 (buy), to each 

possible  bit  string;  hence  there  are 

  possible  strategies  for  group1  or  group2,  respectively, 

m

122

or 

m

which form full strategy spaces (FSS). At the beginning of the game, each agent is assigned s strategies and 
keeps them unchangeable during the game. After each turn, agents assign one (virtual) point to a strategy 
which would have predicted the correct outcome. For agents in group1, they will reward their strategies one 
point if they are in the majority; otherwise, for agents in group2, they will reward their strategies one point 
if they are in the minority. Agents collect the virtual points for their strategies over the time horizon T1 or 
T2, and they use their strategies which have the highest virtual point in each turn. If there are two strategies 
which  have  the  highest  virtual  point,  agents  use  coin  toss  to  decide  which  strategy  to  be  used.  Excess 
demand is equal to the number of ones (buy) which agents choose minus the number of zeros (sell) which 
agents choose. According to a widely accepted assumption that excess demand exerts a force on the price 
of the asset and the change of price is proportion to the excess demand in a financial market [14, 15, 16], 
the time series of price of the asset can be calculated based on the time series of excess demand.   

In simulations, the distribution of initial strategies of agents is randomly distributed and keeps unchanged 
during the games. Simulation turns are 3000. The window length of local volatility is 5. Total number of 
agents is 201. Number of strategies per agent is 2.

First I study how the means of local volatilities change when the proportion of agents in group1 increases. 
Fig.1 shows that means of local volatilities (Vol.1 and Vol.2) decrease while N1/N increases from 0 to 0.4 
under condition of m1=m2=6, T1=T2=60 and condition of m1=6, m2=3, T1=60, T2=12, respectively. But 
under condition of m1=3, m2=6, T1=12, T2=60, the mean of local volatilities (Vol.3) has a minimum value 
at N1/N=0.2.

Then I study the average winnings of agents. From Fig.2, one can find that the average winnings (R1 and 

 

 

R2) of these two groups increase when N1/N is larger than 0.1 and the average winning of group1 is larger 
than those of group2 under the condition of m1=m2=6, T1=T2=60. Agents in both groups benefit from the 
increase of the number of agents in group1. Comparing Fig.2 with Fig.1, one can find that the mean of local 
volatilities  (Vol.1)  decreases  accompanying  with  the  increase  of  the  average  winnings  of  group1  and 
group2 (R1, R2) while N1/N increases from 0 to 0.4 under this condition. Table 1 show that the correlations 
between local volatilities and the average winnings of both groups are negative while the correlation of the 
average winnings of these two groups is positive. 

This result means that the improvement of the efficiency of systems is accordant with the improvement 
of the performance of individual agents under this simulation condition. Both groups and the whole system 
benefit from the increase of the number of agents in group1. Similar phenomena can be found in ecological 
systems, computing systems and economic systems in which agents (species, computing tasks and firms) 
having different niches will improve the efficiencies of systems and their own performance [17].

From  Fig.  3,  one  can  find  that  the  average  winnings  (R1  and  R2)  of  these  two  groups  don’t  change 
obviously when N1/N increases from 0 to 0.4, except R1 at N1/N=0.1. The average winnings of group1 are 
larger  than  those  of  group2.  Comparing  Fig.3  with  Fig.1,  one  can  find  that  the  mean  of  local  volatilities 
(Vol.2) decreases while N1/N increases from 0 to 0.4 under the condition of m1=6, m2=3, T1=60, T2=12, 
but the change of the average winnings of group1 and group2 (R1, R2) seems more complicated than those 
in  Fig.2.  Table  2  gives  a  clearer  picture  about  the  correlations  among  R1,  R2  and  Vol.2  under  this 
simulation condition: the correlation between R1 and R2 is negative; the correlation between R1 and Vol.2 
is positive while the correlation between R2 and Vol.2 is negative.

From Fig. 4, one can find that the average winnings (R1 and R2) of these two groups increase obviously 
when N1/N increases from 0 to 0.4 and the average winning of group1 (R1) is larger than that of group2 
(R2). Agents in both groups benefit from the increase of the number of agents in group1. Comparing Fig.4 
with Fig.1, one can find that the mean of local volatilities (Vol.3) decreases slightly when N1/N increase 
from 0 to 0.2, then it increase while N1/N increases from 0.2 to 0.4 under the condition of m1=3, m2=6, 
T1=12, T2=60, accompanying with the increase of the average winnings of group1 and group2 (R1, R2). 
Table 3 shows that the correlations between local volatilities and the average winnings of both groups are 
positive and the correlation of average winnings of these two groups is also positive. This means that the 
improvement  of  the  performance  of  individual  agents  accompanies  with  the  decrease  of  the  system 
efficiency under this simulation condition. Agents can make profits from the larger fluctuation of systems, 
which is accordant with the reality of financial markets [18].   

4.  Potential applications----an open question 

The  above  results  could  give  the  following  suggestions  when  we  use  mix-game  model  to  design  or 

model complex systems. 

(cid:122) 

(cid:122) 

If  we  want  to  design  a  system  with  both  high  efficiency  of  the  system  and  high  individual 
performance, we need to make the agents have different payoffs, the same memory lengths and a 
relatively large number of agents in group1.   
If we use mix-game to model financial markets, we need to make m1 smaller than m2. 

5.  Concluding remarks: 

In mix-game model, the correlations between the average winnings of agents (R1 and R2) and the mean 
of  local  volatilities  are  different  with  different  combinations  of  memory  lengths  of  agents  (m1  and  m2) 
when  the  proportion  of  agents  in  group1  increases.  The  combinations  of  agents’  memory  lengths  largely 

influence  the  relation  of  the  system  efficiency  and  the  average  individual  performance.  This  result  could 
give some guidance in designing complex systems.

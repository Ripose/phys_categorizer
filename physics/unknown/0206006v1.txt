Abstract

The  equilibrium  of  a  finite-b

  RFP  plasma  in  the  presence  of  saturated-amplitude  tearing  modes  is

investigated. The singularities of the MHD force balance equation J· B=(cid:209) p at the modes rational surfaces

are resolved through a proper regularization of the zeroth-order (equilibrium) profiles,  by setting to zero

there the gradient of the pressure and parallel current density.  An equilibrium model, which satisfies the

regularization rule at the various rational surfaces,  is developed. The comparison with  the  experimental

data from the Reversed Field eXperiment (RFX)  gives encouraging results.  The model provides an easy

tool for magnetic analysis: many aspects of the perturbations can be analyzed and reconstructed.

1. Introduction

The stationary equilibrium state of a plasma corresponds to a local minimum energy state compatible with

external  constraints.  Any  mathematical  treatment  of  instabilities  that  can  arise  regards  them  as  small

perturbations to be  treated within a perturbative expansion. Such an approach decouples the evolution of

the  equilibrium  profiles  from  that  of  the  instabilities,  therefore  neglecting  any  modification  on  the

equilibrium profiles determined by the instabilities themselves. Tokamak plasmas are almost totally driven

by external means and it is likely that the influence of instabilities on equilibrium profile be small here.  On

the other hand,  it is well known  that the sustainment of the  Reversed  Field  Pinch  (RFP)  configuration
against resistive diffusion  is  provided  self-consistently  by  the  plasma itself through  the  generation  of
magnetohydrodinamical  (MHD) modes  (dynamo  modes).  These  modes  in  fact  determine  a  relaxation
(flattening) of the equilibrium profiles which drive the configuration near the Taylor’s minimum  energy
state [1]. In this case the feedback effect of saturated instabilities on the equilibrium profiles is essential.

The most important instabilities observed in an RFP  are tearing modes which exist because of  the  very

small but all the same finite plasma resistivity. A tearing mode is conveniently identified via its poloidal

mode number,  m,  and its  toroidal  mode  number,  n.  They  are  resonant  modes,  i.e.  a  flux-surface for
m,n ) = m / n  exists inside the plasma. The flux-surface where the previous condition holds
which q(r = rs
is the (m, n) rational surface.  The  resistivity  breaks  the  flux-freezing  constraint  in  the  Faraday-Ohm’s

law,  and allows the tearing and reconnection of  equilibrium  magnetic  flux  surfaces,  to  produce  helical

magnetic island centred on the rational surfaces.  The textbook approach to the description of  this  mode

attempts to retain the simplicity of ideal MHD in most of the plasma (“outer” region) by limiting resistive

effects as well  as  the  non-ideal  terms  of  the  motion  equation  (inertia  and  viscosity)  in  the  nearby  the

rational surface (“inner” region) [2], and matching by continuity the two regions.  Therefore in the outer

region the marginally–stable (¶

after neglecting  the  inertia  term  r v (cid:215)
equation for a (m, n) mode is a magnetic differential equation, which schematically can be written

(cid:209) v   and  the  viscous  force  n

2 v .  The  perturbed  force  balance

The source term sm,n depends on the equilibrium profiles.  In order to avoid problems of infinities in the

perturbations approaching the rational surfaces the Newcomb’s solvability condition

must be satisfied [3]. For an arbitrary equilibrium profile the force balance equation in the ideal form (1)

does not fulfill this request. A way to satisfy the Newcomb’s condition is to take into account the inertia

and viscous terms,  discarded in the outer region,  in the proximity of the rational surface (inner region).

Another possibility, investigated in this work, which allows to maintain the force balance equation in the
form (1) also  in  the  inner  region,  is  to  introduce  a  “regularization”  of  the  zeroth-order  profiles  at  the
rational surfaces. It will be discussed later that this regularization imposes the vanishing of the gradients
of  the  equilibrium  pressure  and  parallel  current at  the  rational  surfaces.  We  will  follow  this  path  for
various reasons:
(I) First, the scale length over which the velocity perturbation varies near the rational surfaces is not likely
to be smaller than the width of the island associated to the mode.  Under this hypothesis,  for sufficiently
high mode amplitudes (like those observed in the RFX  experiment [4]) the inertia and viscous terms can

2

(cid:209)
be safely  ignored  also  within  the  island  region.  This  is  justified  in  the  appendix A,  and  seems  to  be

confirmed by the fact that in RFX the tearing modes are always observed to be phase-locked. According

to  a  recent  analysis  [5]  the  phase-locking  is  the  condition  under  which  the  electromagnetic  torque

developed  at  the  rational  surfaces  by  the  non-linear  interaction  between the  modes  has  the  minimum

amplitude: the necessity of having a phase-locking to reach the force balance in  the  steady-state  motion

equation means that at the rational surfaces the inertia and viscous terms are sub-dominant with respect to

the electromagnetic term. In  this  conditions  the  only  important  non-ideal  contribution  near  the  rational

surface would be the resistivity term in the Faraday-Ohm’s law.

(II) Second,  the “regularization rule” implies a connection between the    number  of  instabilities  and  the

shape of the equilibrium profiles that is found also in the experiment. In fact,  in  the  presence of  many

resonant modes the combined effect of the regularizations at the different rational surfaces determines an

overall flattening of the profiles: the more modes we have the flatter the profile we get.  There are mainly

two experimental observations that support this hypothesis: a) in RFX  several resonant  instabilities  are

observed and the parallel  current profile is      very       flat   .  This  is  not  only  indicated  by  the  standard  a

-Q

0

equilibrium  model [1],  commonly  adopted for  RFPs,  but  it  is  also  confirmed  and  reinforced  by  the
internal polarimetric measurements [6]. b) When some of the secondary m=1 modes disappear, either for

a spontaneous process (a

-mode [7]) or for an external influence (PPCD [8]), a    steepening     of the parallel

current profile is observed. Another striking confirmation of our ideas comes from the recently published

reconstruction of the MST equilibrium profiles [9].

(III) The regularization rule brings in a  natural  way  to  a  model for  computing  the  parallel  current and

pressure profiles.  Under  some  reasonable  assumptions,  these  rule  can  be  converted  into  mathematical

relations whose  solution  gives  the  self-consistent  equilbrium  profile.  The  required information  are  the

global equilibrium parameters Q

,  F,  b

p and the number of observed instabilities. The regularization rule

can be considered a way to quantify the relaxation of the equilibrium profile due to the dynamo modes.

Moreover it allows the use everywhere of the relatively simple equation (1) to compute the perturbation.

Therefore this approach provides a tool for magnetic analysis  that,  in  our  opinion,  is  worthy  of  being

investigated.

The plan of the work  is the following: in Section 2 we analyze of the problem of the equilibrium in the

presence of saturated resonant instabilities, showing how to overcome the singularity of the force balance
equation  by  ad-hoc  regularization  of  equilibrium  profiles.  Sections  3  enter  in  the  details  of  the
regularization method, showing practically how it is expected to modify equilibrium profiles.  Section 4 is
devoted to the description of the numerical algorithm adopted for solving equilibrium equations. Section 5
gives examples of application of the algorithm to specific RFX  plasmas: equilibrium profiles derived by

our model are computed and compared with the the standard a

-Q

0 prediction. From the other  side,  we

will give an estimate for profiles of instabilities and for their amplitudes inside the plasma, starting from
the measurement of their values to the edge. This allows the determination of many valuable quantities for

3

confinement studies, such as the degree of stochasticity inside the plasma, and the spatial reconstruction

of the total field perturbation. To this regard,  we point out that this work  may be seen as a continuation

and  a  completion  of  a  previous  analysis  of  the  magnetic  perturbation  in  the  vacuum  region  of  RFX

[10,11]. Conclusions are drawn in section 6. Two appendices containing mathematical proofs  (Appendix

A) and possible improvements over some simplifications adopted in the main text (appendix B) complete

the paper.

2. Equilibrium equations

2.1 Zeroth-order fields

We consider the usual  cylindrical  geometry:  the  system  is  taken to  be  periodic  in  the  z-direction  with

periodicity length 2p R; a simulated  toroidal  angle f

  =z/R  is  adopted.  We  assume  that any  given  field

consists of a cylindrical symmetric zeroth-order component (the equilibrium profile) plus a perturbation:

2.2 Perturbations

The first-order component of equation (1) is :

Non-linear  coupling  of  the  perturbations  are  neglected,  because  they  would  give  higher  order

contributions. Taking the curl of this equation we get rid of the pressure term:

perturbations we get the relations for the generic (m,n) harmonic. It is convenient to define the quantity

(Eq.30). Expressions of the form (32, 33) appear both in (15) and in (16). Since the two expressions are
differently linearly combined, it is not possible that the two divergences cancel out each other,  and instead
they must be regularized separately.
This  implies  g0  =  c  =  0,  otherwise  0<n < 1  (see  26)  would  lead  to  divergencies  in  both  (32,33).

In conclusion our requests of a non-vanishing radial field and finite  poloidal  and  toroidal  perturbations

approaching  the  rational  surface  impose  the  conditions  b=  0,  c=0  on  the  zeroth-order  fields.  The
condition c= g0 = 0  implies that the pressure gradient vanishes at the mode rational surface.  Assuming g

the parallel current profile also must vanish at the rational surface, and the pressure gradient has a second-
order zero  there.  The  last  condition  is  in  agreement  with  the  request  of  having  a  monotonic pressure

profile, in which case  g0
zero at the rational surface was previously obtained in [14].
With such conditions imposed on the  equilibrium  profiles  the  force  balance  equation  (17)  satisfies  the
Newcomb’s solvability condition [3] because at the mode rational  surface  it  degenerates  in  the  identity
0=0. It must be solved in the two separate regions between the axis and the rational surface [0,  rS  [, and
between the rational surface and the external boundary ] rS,  rshell ], which is assumed to be given by  an

9

ideal shell located at r = rshell .  The suitable  conditions  at  the  origin  and  the  boundary,  and  the  natural
requirement of the continuity of the solution y

 at rS are imposed. In general it will not be possible to solve

the  problem with  a  first  radial  derivative  dy

/dr  continuos  at  rS.  This  corresponds  to  the  fact  that  the

coefficient of the small solution may be discontinuos across the rational surface [13].

3. A model for s 

 and g

According to the previous discussion,  in the presence of many  saturated  resonant  modes  the  quantities

/dr,  g(r) and dg/dr must  vanish  at  the  mode  rational  surfaces.  In  RFX  we  have  many  m=1  modes

internally resonant and m=0 modes resonat at the reversal surface. Therefore we make the ansatz

which  automatically  satisfies  ds

/dr=  g(r)=  dg/dr=  0  at  the  m=1  and  m=  0  mode  rational  surfaces,

provided that the shape functions f(r), h(r) (till now  undefined) are there regular functions.  If we want a

monotonic decreasing s (r) profile then we set

together with the supplementary constrain f(r)£

 0. Note that, due to the modulus,  in this case the second

derivative of s

 is not defined at the rational surfaces.  Nevertheless the expressions (20, 21,  22) require

the existence of the first derivative only. At r= 0 for symmetry reasons we have ds (0)/dr=0 and g(0)=0.

This implies f(0)= h(0)= 0.
Note that M is indeed a function of q; as long as q(r) is a monotonic function, we can use q in place of r
as independent variable and write

where qa is the value at the plasma boundary,  in RFX  determined by a graphite wall placed at the radius

r= a. The graphite wall leans against an inconel vessel located at r= rV ,  beyond which there is a vacuum

region which extends up to the conducting  shell  placed  at  r=  rshell=  1.17a.  In  a  situation  of  stationary
modes helical eddy currents cannot be induced in the vessel,  so  both y

/dr are continuos at r= rV.

 and dy

There is still the possibility for zeroth-order currents to flow in the inconel vessel; our fluid model fails

there, but we are confident that the current amplitude is so small that can be safely neglected. Furthermore

zeroth-order currents cannot flow at  all  in  graphite  wall  [15].  In  conclusion we  treat  the  entire  region

between the plasma boundary and the shell as     vacuum     :

Notice that if we want equation (17) to hold at the boundary r= a,  then we need the quantities s,  ds

From  g(a)=  0=  dp0(a)/dr  and  p0(r>a)=  0  it  follows  p0(qa)=  0.  Moreover  conditions  (47)  force  the

where F

t  is the toroidal flux. All the edge magnetic quantities are provided by a direct measure, so we can

consider the determination of Q

, F to be exact. Instead the integral which appears in the expression for b

p

depends on the assumption made on the pressure  profile. At present in RFX  b

p  is  computed  assuming

given polinomial expressions for  the  electron  density  and  temperature  profiles.  Our  pressure  model is

different, so we take this “experimental” b

p only as a reference value. Note that

50) qa

F

= a
R

so qa can be used in place of F or Q

.

If  we  require that  different  triplets  (F,  Q

,  b

p)  correspond  to  different  profiles,  the  number  of  free

parameters must be at least three. Another element to take into consideration is the Suydam criterion (31)

for  the  pressure  gradient.  In  our  model  this  criterion  is  verified  in  most  of  the  plasma,  due  to  the

prescriptions (40, 41) which flatten the pressure profile on a wide region.  A violation could arise in the

edge zone, because in our model the pressure gradient is mostly concentrated between the reversal surface

and  the  boundary  r=  a.  Anyway  we  have  no  elements  to  say  that  in  RFX  the  Suydam  criterion  is

everywhere fulfilled, and we cannot indeed exclude the presence of  localized  interchange  modes  at  the

very edge of the plasma. This discussion suggests  that a  fourth  free  parameter  is  needed to  model the

pressure profile near the plasma boundary: this parameter will be tuned in order satisfy or at least to have
a marginal violation of the Suydam criterion there.
According to these arguments and to the condition (48) the simplest model for the functions w, u yields
the expressions

51)  w(q) = w0 (1 - q / qa )

; u(q) = u0 (1 - q / qa )

;    a > 0 ;    b > 1;

.  The

normalization  constant  w 0  is  not  free  but  depends  on  (qa,a
regularization term M(r). This will be demonstrated in the following discussion.

4. Getting the solution: numerical scheme

The actual procedure to obtain the zeroth-order profiles for a given triplet (F, Q

, b

p) or (qa, F, b

p) is quite

involved and in principle, there is not guarantee for the solution to be unique, though we found that all of

the admissible solutions are very close between them. First of all, the two possible choices (41, 42) for

the  regularization  term  M(r)  discriminate  between  monotonic  and  not-monotonic  s (r)  profiles.  An

integrated analysis  [6] of the  external  magnetic  signals  and  the  data provided  by  a  five-chord infrared

(FIR)  polarimeter  indicates  that in  RFX  the  s (r)  profiles  should  be      very       flat   ,  or  even      hollow       with  a

maximum  in  the  external  region  of  the  plasma.  In  our  model  the  flattening  of  the  s (r)  is  a  direct

consequence  of  the  regularization  term M(r):  the  higher  the  number  of  modes  we  have  the  flatter  the

profile we get. Moreover with the non-monotonic choice (41) we have a local maximum of s (r) just at the

reversal surface where q(r)=0. We will investigate both the possibilities (41, 42).

In actual calculations, the product over (1, n) modes must-of course-be truncated to  a  finite  number  of

terms.  The  number  of  m=1  factors  in  M(r)  is  determined  by  the  modes  experimentally  observed.

Generally in RFX the dominant m=1 modes have a toroidal number in the range n=7‚ 10.  There is also a

tail of secondary modes which in some pulses can also extend to  high  (n» 18,19)  mode  numbers.  The

range [nmin, nmax] of factors in M(r) is chosen taking into account also the following two observations:
a) the flattening of the computed s (r),  p0(r) profiles extends well beyond the  resonance position  of  the
m=1,  n= nmax mode.  This effect is  more  pronounced  for  the  pressure,  because we  have  a  term M2(r)
there.

b) the zero-gradient constraint is strictly true only for the ideal force balance equation (1). When viscosity

and inertia are taken into account this constraint slightly relaxes: as shown in the appendix A,  at the mode
rational  surface  the  gradient  of  the  equilibrium  current  should  be  not  zero  but  only  very  small  and
inversely proportional to the magnetic perturbation amplitude (see formulas (A16),  (A18)).  Therefore we
decide to include in the product M(r)    all    of the dominant modes and    some    of the secondary modes,  with
the check a posteriori that the flat region of s (r) and p0(r) includes all of the rational surfaces of the modes

experimentally observed. The latter condition requires a lower number of factors for g(r) than for s (r),  so

we leave the possibility that nmin and nmax appearing in the definition of M(r) could be different  for  s (r)

13

and g(r). In conclusion, there is some freedom in the definition of M(r), but different plausible choices of

the m=1 factors do not substantially change the profiles.
Having  defined M(r),  we  set  qa  equal to  the  experimental  value (50),  and  take  a  value  a >0  for  the
exponent of w(q). The two equations (8, 9) can be combined to give a single equation for q(r) where the

pressure gradient term g(r) does not appear. We combine this equation with the expression for ds

 /dr to

form the system

The system is solved in the interval [0,  a] .  The apparently more natural direction of integration is from
the edge towards the centre, knowing the starting conditions q(a) = qa ,  s (a) = 0.  However,  one  must
also take into account that from (44, 51)

that is, the r.h.s. of the latter of (52) depends upon the unknown value of s

 at the centre.

For  this is reason it is more convenient to solve eqns. (52) in the direction from the centre towards  the

edge, using guessed initial values and iterating until matching at the edge with the boundary conditions is

obtained. To this purpose, remember that the relation

must be satisfied. Of course, the value of s (0) must also be consistent with the resonant modes taken in

The first condition (67) is strictly true only for an ideal shell. The RFX shell is thick but not exactly ideal,

since  a  slow  penetration  of  the  radial  field is  observed.  This  is  shown  by  the  measurements  of  two

poloidal arrays of radial field pick-up coils placed on the  inner  surface  of  the  shell.  At present  toroidal
m,n   (proportional to c m,n ) at a

arrays of radial field probes, which are necessary to obtain the harmonics br

given radius, are not available. Therefore the simplest way to set the initial value for c m,n is to adopt the

ideal  shell  approximation  (assumed  in  all the  following  examples).  A  viable  method  to  improve  this

approximation is described in appendix B.

The second condition (67) is derived by a combination of (16) and (18) applied in  vacuum,  and  by  the

ideal shell constraint y m,n(rshell)=0.  The harmonic  bf

angles [16].

Fig. 4. Here the comparison, in the external region of the  plasma,  between  the  normalized pressure gradient
and  the  Suydam  limit  is  shown:  the  violation  of  this  limit  is  rather  marginal.  The  agreement  could  be
improved by increasing the exponent b

.

Pulse        11029,       t        =        35         ms,        during        PPCD

The same shot is considered when the PPCD [8] is active. During the PPCD a decrease of the amplitude

of the  secondary  m=1  modes  is  observed.  This  entails  a  reduction  of  nmax  in  M(r)  and  a  consequent
steepening of the s (r) profile (fig. 5).

Fig. 5. The normalized s

 profile.

22

The peaking of  the  profile is  also  predicted  by  the  a

-Q

0  model.  A  similar  peaking is  apparent  in  the

pressure profile. As discussed is the introduction this confirms the existence of a connection between the

number of the instabilities and the shape of the zeroth-order profiles.  During the PPCD the activity of the

dynam modes is weaker and consequently the profile is less relaxed (steeper).

Fig. 6. During the PPCD our model satisfies everywhere the Suydam criterion.

Alike the PPCD, the so called a

-mode is characterized by a decrease of the secondary m=1 modes and by

a steepening of the profiles.

5.2 Non-monotonic s

 profile

As mentioned before, there are evidences supporting the possibility for s

 profiles to be non-monotonic in

RFX  plasmas. In our formalism, it means using Eq.  (41) instead of (42) in computations. Note that in

this case w 0<0, because of the significant negative contribution of M(r) to the integral (53) in the region
between the reversal and the edge.  With this kind of profile we found that the convergence of equations

(63, 64) to the experimental desired values of (F, Q

, b

p) is not guaranteed. We relate this to the following

physical aspects of the problem:

(I) First, we have found that a necessary condition is to have a decreasing s (r) between the origin and the

first m=1 rational surface.  With the monotonic profile this  condition  is  automatically  fulfilled.  Instead,
using the definition (41) it is satisfied only with an odd number of m= 1 mode. This suggest that the non-

monotonic model for s (r) should  be refined including an extra factor, e.g.:

(II) Second,  there should not be too much distance between the  rational  surface  corresponding  to  nmax
and the reversal position,  otherwise s (r),  which has a positive derivative in this  region,  could  grow  to

unreasonable  values  at  the  reversal.  This  requires  a  configuration  with  a  considerable  number  of

secondary m=1 modes, in other word a sufficiently relaxed profile.

(III) Third, since in the non-monotonic case the maximum of s (r) is reached at the reversal surface and it

is unlikely that too much current be driven at the very edge of the plasma, to make the profile plausible the

reversal should  be  at  a  suitable  distance  from  the  plasma  boundary,  i.e.  the  F  parameter  should  be

sufficiently negative.

Let’s analyze some specific cases summarized in Table 2. Fig.7 displays the case corresponding to row  3

of Table 2. Here a significant departure from the a

Note the discontinuity of the first derivative across the mode rational surface. We have found that Em,n  = -

consequence of the presence of a current sheet there (i.e. dy

For  the  same  shot  and  time  we  consider  the  mode  m=1,  n=14.  In  this  case  the  amplitude  is  lower:

bf

m,n(1.17)= -1.75 10 - 3 T. The three corresponding profiles are shown below.

27

Fig. 14.  Radial perturbation for the m=1, n=14 mode.

We find Em,n= -1.15;  Jq

m,n = 610 A/m, Jf

m,n = 270 A/m.

Note that in all these example we have found  E m,n „ 0 , so the jump of dy

/dx across the rational surface

is     finite   .  In  particular  we  get  Em,n  <  0  for  the  m=  1  modes  and  Em,n  >  0  for  the  m=  0  modes.  The

parameter Em,n is related to the stability of the mode [13, 17]. Note that the definition (73) is suitable for a

finite-b

 plasma if the pressure gradient vanishes at  the  rational  surface,  as  imposed  in  our  equilibrium

model. The non-linear evolution of a tearing mode is described by the Rutherford island theory [18]. It

28

this case marginal stability should be equivalent to the condition Em,n » 0.  A more rigorous version of this

theory [19] indicates that a mode with Em,n >0  grows  until its amplitude reaches a saturation value which

depends on Em,n. The fact that we get E1,n <0 seems therefore in conflict with these theories. We do not

think  to  solve  this  apparent  contradiction  here.  Anyway  let  us  point  out  two  observations:  1)  The

magnetic field in the plasma core of a RFP is stochastic, due to the effect of overlapping magnetic islands

of the m= 1 modes.  Probably the Rutherford-type  single-helicity  theories should  not  be  applied  to  the

stochastic region of the m=1 modes. 2) If our model is correct, the growth of many instabilities entails an

important  modification  of  the  zeroth-order  profiles.  When  a  condition  of  marginal  stability  is  finally

reached the final relaxed profiles could be quite different from the ones which have  given  origin  to  the
modes.  Therefore also the parameters Em,n should change in time according to  the  zeroth-order  profiles

modifications: the value E1,n <0 computed for the steady state should not mean that the m= 1 modes are

stable; instead it is a consequence of the flattening of the zeroth-order profiles in the central region of the

plasma. Take into account that our zeroth-order profiles seem to be close to the physically realized ones in
RFX, and that any plausible equilibrium profile for RFX would give E1,n <0.

5.4 m=1 islands in RFX

It is established that the enhanced transport of energy and particles in RFP's is due to the destruction of

the magnetic surfaces with overlapping of magnetic islands and resulting stochastic diffusion.  The width

of the magnetic islands is a key parameter within this picture. For  the RFPs  the island width is given by

Table 3. Radial location and width for magnetic islands associated to m=1 modes, before (left) and during

Note that the modes are associated to huge islands which overlap each other to a considerable degree. A

possible choice to quantify the overlapping of the islands is to take an average  of  the  various  Chirikov

parameters for the different couples of neighbour islands [21]:

We pass from sav= 4.4 before the PPCD to sav= 3.3  during the PPCD.  These values are in rather good
agreement with the results of a previous analysis [21].

5.5 m= 0 magnetic island in RFX

The RFX  discharges are characterized by an important m=0 perturbation, which contains many toroidal
Fourier components locked in phase together [5,11]. We show  that this  perturbation  is  associated  to  a
magnetic  island  located  at  the  reversal  surface.  For  sake  of  simplicity  the  effect  due  to  the  m=1

ordinate can be ignored and the magnetic field can be expressed in terms of the toroidal-flux function:

function (86). The contour plot in fig.19 displays a toroidal cross-section of the flux-surfaces located near

the reversal surface. The harmonics with k=1,...10 are taken into account. It is apparent the existence of

an island, highly distorted in the toroidal direction. The island width is about 0.15· a=6.86cm. Moreover

the structure is not symmetric around  the  reversal surface  due  to  the  fact that the  m=0  perturbation  is
mostly concentrated in the very edge of the plasma.

6. Conclusions

The equilibrium in a finite-b

 RFP  plasma in the presence of saturated-amplitude tearing modes has been

investigated analytically and numerically using the ideal-MHD force balance equation (i.e. neglecting the
inertial and viscous terms).  The singularities of this  equation  at  the  modes  rational  surfaces  have  been
dealt  with  by  a  proper  regularization  of  the  zeroth-order  (equilibrium)  profiles:  the  gradients  of  the

pressure and parallel current density (s ) are forced to be equal to zero there. This rule has been combined

with some considerations about general bounds plasmas are constrained to,  to guess  equilibrium profiles

which match the  global discharge parameters  (F,  Q

,  b

p).  The  combined  effects of  a  large number  of

modes makes the s

 and pressure profiles flat over a large portion of the plasma, with a steep gradient in

34

the edge region,  although non-monotonic s

 profiles,  with a  maximum  at  the  reversal surface,  are  also

allowed in principle.  At present  in  RFX  we  have  not  a  shot-by  shot  measurement  of  s

  and  pressure

profile. Anyway,  the first experimental analysis of s (r)  [6]  is  largely  compatible  with  our  model.  The

same is true for the pressure, even if only the electronic component is measured [23]. When some of the

modes are suppressed, the profiles both in our model and in experiment become steeper.

The model can be regarded as a method to obtain the final stage of relaxation  process  produced  by  the

tearing modes.  This equilibrium model allows the use of a relatively simple equation to  get  the  various

perturbations  profiles.  In  this  way  a  complete  magnetic  reconstruction  is  obtained.  Some  interesting

features,  for  example  the  structure  of  the  m=0  island  have  been  already  obtained.  The  possible

implications of the magnetic reconstruction on other aspects, such as the transport, will be investigated.

Some of the reasonings which have led us to the results shown  in previous sections,  are forcefully semi-

quantitative,  therefore  some  room  to  arbitrariness  is  left.  In  particular,  we  think  that  finding  further

constraints allowing to better define "shape" functions w, u (51), would be a possible improvement.   

Appendix A

The inclusion of non-ideal effects like inertia and viscosity does not substantially change our constraint of

zero-gradient  for  the  zeroth-order  quantities  at  the  rational  surfaces.  The  equation  of  motion  and  the

standard situation in RFX. Assuming a slab geometry  and  simple  field profiles,  the  equations become
analytically manageable. Despite the simplification all the key features of the problem are still present.

Let’s assume the existence of a rational surface,  that is  a  plane x=xs  where  By( xs ) = 0 .  The  mode  is
stationary  in the laboratory  frame, so according to the no-slip condition [20] we set Vy(x s ) = 0 .
In the proximity of this surface we use the following expansions:

In a condition of saturated modes it is reasonable to assume that the scale length over which the quantities

related to the velocity perturbation change significantly near the  rational  surface  is  not  smaller  than  the
1/ 2  (see eq. 78), this implies the following estimates

3  the r.h.s. of (A16) should be very small. We have shown

that in  the  ideal  approximation  the  gradient  of  the  equilibrium  current appearing  in  the  force  balance

equation must be zero at the rational surface.  Here we recover a less strict version of this  rule,  i.e.  the

current gradient at the rational surface is not zero but very small

The variation of dy

region [xs-w, xs+w]. Using the expansions and the conditions (A17) and (A19) one gets:

/dx over the island region.  This corresponds

to the ideal approximation result where dy

/dx is discontinuos across the rational surface.  Of course  the

previous analysis can not predict the sign of this variation.

The ideal shell condition is:

B1)  br

m,n(rshell )= 0= c m,n(rshell )= y m,n(rshell).

The total m=0 perturbations are given by eq. (84, 85). The toroidal harmonic amplitude  ˜ b f

m,n  is related to

the mode amplitude  ˜ 

y  m,n  by equation (16). A factor 2 appears in front of the summations  because we

have to include both the (m, n) and the complex conjugate (-m, -n) modes.  The modes  phases  and  the
˜ b f
m,n  amplitudes are obtained at the shell radius  by  the  signals  of  two  toroidal  arrays  of  toroidal  field

probes, placed at opposite poloidal angles. The amplitudes  ˜ b f

m,n (rshell ) are related to the radial derivative

of c m,n by

(This equation is obtained by a combination of (68, 71); e

sh=rshell/ R). Therefore with the ideal condition

(B1) we fix the initial values for both c m,n and dc m,n/dr (see 67). (    Observation    : in the examples discussed

in section 5 the  toroidal  harmonic  amplitude  used  as  initial  condition  is  just  2 ˜ b f

m,n ,  so  the  computed

radial perturbation 2 ˜ 

y  m,n / r  corresponds to the actual value of the (m,n) radial field component).

Actually  the  ideal  shell  constraint  can  not  be  overcome,  because the  lacking  of  an  adequate  set  (i.e.
toroidal    arrays) of radial field probes prevents the direct measure of c m,n .  Anyway a slight improvement

of the condition B1) can be realized.
In fact in RFX two     poloidal    arrays of 16 radial field pick-up coils are also available on the inner surface

of the shell at the toroidal angles f

1= 87(cid:176)  , f

2= 207(cid:176)  . Therefore the m=1 sinq

, cosq

 harmonics as well as

40

(cid:229)
(cid:229)
the m=0 harmonic of the radial field can be measured there. We do not consider the m=1 cosq

 harmonic,

because it is affected by the error fields produced by the inner and outboard toroidal gaps [22]. The m=0

harmonic is expressed by (84) and the m=1 sinq

  by (B2). For the latter taking the difference between the

values at the two toroidal positions we get rid of the axisymmetric component due to the Shafranov shift:

trend indicates that the RFX shell is slowly penetrated by the perturbation.

The value of the perturbation at the rational surface and the parameter Em,n are almost unchanged.

Abstract 
 
In  this  paper,  a  detailed  theoretical  treatment  of  the  three  dimensional  photothermal 
deflection  ,under  modulated  cw  excitation  ,  is  presented  for  a  three  layer  system          
(  backing-solid  sample-fluid).  By  using  a  technique  based  on  Green’s  function  and 
integral transformations we find the explicit expressions for laser induced temperature 
distribution  function  and  the  photothermal  deflection  of  the  probe  beam.  Numerical 
analysis  of  those  expressions  for  certain  solid  samples  leads  to  some  interesting 
results.

techniques  evolved 

I. Introduction 
Photothermal 
the  development  of  photoacoustic 
from 
spectroscopy [1] in the 1970s. They now encompass a wide range of techniques and 
phenomena based upon the conversion of absorbed optical energy into heat . When an 
energy source is focused on the surface of a sample , part or all of the incident energy 
is  absorbed  by  the  sample  and  a  localized  heat  flow  is  produced  in  the  medium 
following  a  series  of  nonradiative  deexcitation  transitions  .  Such  processes  are  the 
origins of the photothermal effects and techniques . If the energy source is modulated, 
a periodic heat flow is produced at the sample . The resulting periodic heat flow in the 
material is a diffusive process that produces a periodic temperature distribution called 
a thermal wave [2]. 
  Several  mechanisms  are  available  for  detecting  ,  directly  or  indirectly  ,  thermal 
waves . These includes gas-microphone photoacoustic detection of heat flow from the 
sample to the surrounding gas [1] ; photothermal measurements of infrared radiation 
emitted from the heated sample surface [3] ; optical beam deflection of a laser beam 
traversing  the  periodically  heated  gaseous  or  liquids  layer  just  above  the  sample 
surface  [4,5]  ;  laser  detection  of  the  local  thermoelastic  deformations  of  the  surface 
[6,7] ; and interferometric detection of the thermoelastic displacement of the sample 
surface  [7,8]  .  In  particular,  the  two  last  schemes  of  thermal  wave  detection  which 
form  the  basis  of    photothermal  deformation  spectroscopy  (PTDS)  [10,11]  are 
becoming  the  most  widely  exploited  ,  the  principal  reason  being  that  they  offer  a 
valuable  mean  for  measuring  optical  and  thermal  parameters  of  materials  ,  such  as 
optical absorption coefficient [12] and thermal diffusivity [13]. 
  The  photothermal  deformation  technique  is  simple  and  straightforward.  A  laser 
beam  (pump  beam)  of  wavelength  within  the  absorption  range  of  the  sample  is 
incident on the sample and it is  absorbed . The sample gets heated and this heating 
leads  ,  through  thermoelastic  coupling  ,  to  an  expansion  of  the  interaction  volume 
which  in  turn  causes  the  deformation  of  the  sample  surface.  The  resulting 
thermoelastic  deformation  of  the surface  is detected by the deflection of a  second , 
weaker laser beam (probe beam). 
Ameri and his colleagues were among those who have used first , both the laser 
 
interferometric  and 
techniques  for  spectroscopic  studies  on 
amorphous  silicon  [6].Their  method  restricted  to  low  to  moderate  modulation 
frequencies.  Opsal  et  al  have  used  thermal  wave  detection  for  thin  film  thickness 
measurements  using  laser  beam  deflection  technique[8].  They  have  obtained 
temperature  distribution  function  for  what  is  called  1-D  temperature  distribution 
function. In their analysis they assumed both probe and pump beams incident normal 
to  the  sample  surface.  Miranda  obtained  sample  temperature  distribution  by 
neglecting  transient  as  well  as  the  dc  components  of  the  temperature  distribution 
function  [9].    On  the  other  hand  ,  the  theory  of  photothermal  displacement  under 
pulsed  laser  excitation  in  the  quasistatic  approximation  has  been  given  by  Li  [14]  . 
Zhang  and  collaborators  have  investigated  the  more  general  case  of  dynamic 
thermoelastic response under short laser pulse excitation [15]. Moreover, Cheng and 
Zhang  have  considered  the  effect  of  the  diffusion  of  photo-generated  carriers  in 
semiconductors on the photothermal signal [16]. 
 
In this paper , we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the deflection process in 
three dimensions,for a three layer system consisting of a transparent fluid ,an optically 
 

laser  deflection

absorbing solid sample , and  a backing material . It  is assumed  that  the system is 
irradiated  by  a  modulated  cw  laser  beam  .The  theoretical  treatment  of  photothermal 
deflection can be devided into two parts. In Sec II.A we will find the 3D laser-induced 
temperature distribution within the three region of the system , due to the absorption 
of  the  pump  beam.  Our  mathematical  approach  is  based  on  Green’s  function  and 
integral  transformations  .  In  Sec  II.B  the  temperature  distribution  within  the  fluid 
derived in Sec II.A will be used to calculate the photothermal deflection of the probe 
beam directed through the fluid . In Sec III numerical results are presented for typical 
solid samples, and finally the conclusions are drawn in Sec IV. 

II. Theory of CW Photothermal Deflection 
Let us consider the geometry as shown in Fig.1 . The solid sample is assumed to be 
deposited on a backing and is in contact with a fluid . lf  , l , and  lb  are the thicknesses 
of the fluid , sample , and the backing , respectively . The fluid can be air or another 
medium . It is assumed that the solid sample is the only absorbing medium ; the fluid 
and the backing are transparent. For simplicity , we also assume that all three regions 
extend  to  infinity  in  radial  directions.  A  modulated  cw  cylindrical  laser  beam 
irradiates  perpendicularly  the  surface  of  sample  .  The  first  task  is  to  derive  the 
temperature distribution in the fluid due to the heating of the sample surface.

Since  Eq.(37)  is  not  in  a  closed  form  , it should be evaluated numerically. A useful 
special case occurs for laser beams of very large diameters. In this case λ approaches 
zero , so A(λ) and as a result E(λ) behave as delta function [cf. Eqs.(12),(25)]. In this

Now, these relations are in closed form. This model is referred to as the 1-D model, 
because  the  diffusion  of  the  heat  occurs  only  in  one  dimension,that  is,in  the  z- 
direction  .The  theory  for  the  1-D  model  was  first  developed  by  Rosencwaig  and 
Gersho[17].  In  1-D  model  ,  thermal  length  and  thermal  wavelength  [Eqs.(35)  and 
(36)] reduces respectively to the forms,

Similar simple interpretation can also be given to Φb and Φs . The temperature of the 
backing Φb is represented by backward traveling thermal waves . The temperature of 
the  sample  itself  is  represented  by  a  forward  traveling  and  a  backward  traveling 
thermal  wave  ,  and  a  term  representing  the  absorption  of  the  laser  energy.  It  is 
sσ  as they set the scale over which 
instructive to consider the typical values of 
various physical effects are observable. For  N2 at atmospheric pressure , 
fσ =0.85mm 
sσ =0.18mm for 
for f=10Hz and it is 0.27mm for f=100Hz . For a sample of α-Si:H , 
f=10Hz and it is 0.06mm for f=100Hz.

2nd.  Photothermal Deflection 
In this section the temperature distribution Tf  , Eq .(37) , will be used to calculate the 
photothermal  deflection  of  a  probe  beam  propagating  through  the  fluid  in  thermal 
contact  with  the  sample.  Figure2  shows  an  illustration  of    a  deflection  experiment  . 
The pump beam is incident on the sample in the z-direction . The sample itself is in 
the x-y plane and the probe beam propagates in the x-direction . 
  The  temperature  distribution  gives  rise  to  a  spatially  varying  index  of  refraction 
given by

deflection of  a beam propagating through such a spatially varying index of  refraction  
can  be  found  from  Fermat’s  principle,  which  states  that  the  optical  path  length  is  a 
minimum of the system Hamiltonian . The result is [17]

III. Numerical Results and Discussions 
In  this  section  we  will  describe  the  results  obtained  for  the  temperature  distribution 
within  the  three  layer  system  and  photothermal  deflection  of  the  probe  beam.  The 
temperature profile Tf [Eq.(37)] and the thermal deflection signals θt [Eq.(51)] and θn 
[Eq.(52)] can not be evaluated in closed form , so numerical methods must be used.

We  first  consider  the  temperature  distribution  Tf  .  It  is  useful  to  look  at  the 
integrand in Eq.(37). The Bessel function contributes to oscillation in the integrand , 
while  the  exponential  term  exp(
  makes  the  function  damp  out  .  This  is 
rather  convenient  ,  because  we  can  replace  the  upper  limit  on  the  integration  by  a 
m , such that the integrand reduces to negligible values for λ >λm  . We 
certain value λ
2λ−
choose λm to be such that to make 
m is inversely 
a
proportional to  a  . Depending on the values of ω and a , the range of integration 0 to 
λm  is  divided  into  3  to  10  regions  .  Each  region  has  been  calculated  by  Gaussian 
quadrature  of  64-points.  In  the  following  ,  the  backing  and  fluid  are  assumed  to  be 
Corning glass ( kb=1W/m.K , Db=6× 10-7m2/s) and  N2 gas ( kf =2.6× 10-2W/m.K , Df  
= 23  × 10-6 m2/s ) [20] , respectively . It is also assumed that the pump beam power 
P=1W and light-heat conversion coefficient η=1. 
 
In  figure  4a  ,  assuming  that  the  solid  sample  to  be  Ge  ,  we  have  plotted  the 
temperature  (  temperature  deviation  from  the  ambient  value)  distribution  at  the 
surface of the sample Ts(r,0,t) [= Tf (r,0,t)] as  a function of  r  for several values of 
time  in  one  modulation  cycle  .  Equation  (37)  has  been  evaluated  by  using  the 
parameters  given  on  the  figure  .  It    is    found      that    at  ω

a . This means that the heat does not diffuse very much beyond the extent of the pump  
beam in the x-y plane. It is important to note that the temperature fluctuates between 
positive and negative values , because we have calculated only the oscillatory part of 
the temperature. The actual temperature consists of the oscillatory part superimposed 
on  a  time  independent  part  (  contributed  by  the  factor  A(r)  exp(αz)  in  the  source 
term), which we have not calculated. In figure 4b , we have plotted the temperature 
distribution Ts(r,0,t) as a function of  r  for  f=100Hz . Other parameters are the same 
as those in Fig.4a . As it is seen the general behavior of  Ts is not so sensitive to the 
change  of  modulation  frequency  in  such  a  manner  that  the  difference  between  two 
figures is rather quantitative than qualitative. 
  Figures  5a  and  5b  show  the  temperature  distribution  Tf (0,z,t) as a function of  z  
for several values of time in one modulation cycle and for f = 10 Hz and f= 100 Hz , 
respectively . The surface temperature is sinousoidally modulated as found in Fig.4 , 
and a thermal wave propagate in the fluid . The thermal wave is strongly attenuated 
with the decay length of the order of 
  Figure 6 shows the peak values of the temperature in the fluid Tf0  as a function of 
the distance z for three different values of the modulation frequency f  . Two effects 
should  be  noted  .  First  ,  the  temperature  of  the  sample  surface  decreases  with 
increasing modulation frequency because of the thermal inertia of the sample.In other 
words , the sample is unable to respond to the intensity changes to a lesser and lesser 
degree as the modulation frequency of the pump laser increases. Second , the effective 
thermal length  σ decreases with increasing frequency , thereby making the decay of 
f
photothermal signal with z  faster .   
  Figure  7a  shows  the  dependence  of  the  peak values of the temperature at sample 
surface on  r  for three different types of solid samples . As the thermal diffusivity Ds 
increases  the  temperature  decreases  because  the  heat  is  able  to  diffuse  further  . 
Moreover , the profile of the temperature distribution gets broader with increasing Ds . 
Here the optical absorption coefficient α for each of the three samples is much larger 
−σ   . This case corresponds to the situation when 
than the corresponding values of  
most of the laser energy is absorbed near the surface of the sample. It appears that the 
thermal diffusion in the negative z-direction dominates over thermal diffusion in the r-
direction in this case. We also find no significant effect of the thermal diffusivity of 
the fluid on the temperature profiles at the surface. In Fig. 7b we have plotted Tf0 at 
z=0 as a function of r . Here the modulation frequency is assumed to be f = 100Hz. 
Other  parameters  are  the  same  as  those  in Fig.7a . Comparison with Fig .7a reveals 
that Tf0  decreases with increasing f  . In fact as the modulation frequency increases 
the  transmission  coefficient  of  thermal  wave  at  the  boundary  of  sample  and  fluid 
increases and in consequence Tf0 decreases . In addition with increasing f , the profile 
temperature distribution gets narrower , as expected . 
  Figure  8  shows  the  temperature  profile  as  a  function  of  r  in  the  fluid    for  the 
parameters  shown  on  the  figure  .  The  temperature  profile  is  seen  to  broaden  with 
increasing z , as expected . 
  We now proceed to evaluate numerically the deflection signal [Eqs.(51),(52),(53) 
and  (54)]  .  For  this  purpose  ,  as  before  ,  we  have  used  Gaussian  quadrature  of  64-
points. The deflection takes place in three dimensions ; the probe beam propagates in 
the  x-direction  and  is  deflected  normally  away  from  the  sample  surface  into  the  z-
direction , θn in Eq.(52), and tangential to the sample surface into the y-direction, θt in

(at room temperature) and η=1 . 

Eq.(51),  as  was  shown  in  Figs.1  and  3  .  As  before  ,  we  assume  that  the  fluid  and 
backing  are  nitrogen  gas  and  Corning  glass  ,  respectively  .  It  is  also  assumed  that 
1
−
pump power P=1W , 
  For the glass-Ge-nitrogen system , Figures 9a and 9b give θt and θn , respectively, 
as functions of y at z=0 for different values of time in one modulation cycle and for 
f=10 Hz. As before , the initial value of the time , θ = ωt is chosen such that  Tf =0 at 
y=0  at  this  time  .  The  normal  deflection  is  maximum  at  y  =  0  but  in  the  tangential 
deflection  there  is  no  signal  when  the  pump  is  centered  on  the  probe  at  y=  0  ,  the 
probe beam is pulled equally in each direction . To either side of this point , the probe 
beam  is  deflected  in  opposite  directions  ,  up  or  down  ,  thus  the  change  in  sign  on 
either side. In both figures the distribution is reflective of the Gaussian pump profile. 
 
In figures 10a  and 10b the peak values of the tangential and normal photothermal 
deflection are plotted against the y coordinate , for several different values of z and 
for  f  =  10Hz.  These  are  the  signals  that  are  generally  measured  using  the  lock-in 
techniques. As the distance from the surface increases the deflection signal intensity 
decreases and the width increases since the heat is dispersed throughout more of the 
fluid. It is interesting to note that the gradient of θn0, for the values of the parameters 
chosen  here,  is  ~2  orders  of  magnitudes  smaller  than  that  that  of  θt0  .  In  fact  the 
gradient of photothermal deflection ( curvature of refractive index ) characterizes the 
inverse  of  the  focal  length  of  the  thermal  lens  [21]  that  is  produced  by  the  heating 
action  of  the  Gaussian  laser  beam.  Therefore  we  find  that  the  peak  value  of  the 
inverse  focal  length  of  the  photothermal  lens  in  the  z  direction  is  ~2  orders  of 
magnitude smaller than that of in y  direction . 
  The  effect  of  changing  the  sample  diffusivity/conductivity  on  the  tangential 
deflection  signal  is  shown  in  Fig.11.  The  peak  value  decreases  as  the  sample 
diffusivity is increased. This is the behavior that was seen in the fluid temperature of  
figures 7a and 7b. As modeled the absorption coefficient of the sample is very large 
and  the  radiation  absorption  is  taking  place  at  the  surface.  The  heat  then  diffuses 
preferentially  into  and  throughout  the  sample  due  to  the  relatively  low  thermal 
conductivity of the fluid.  For a small sample diffusivity the signal is larger due to the 
heat lingering at the surface for a longer time , allowing more heat to conduct into and 
through  the  fluid.  The  increased  heat  results  in  a  larger  index  gradient  and  larger 
deflection.  With  a  larger  sample  diffusivity/conductivity  the  heat  quickly  disperses 
throughout the sample, leaving only the initial surface heat to diffuse into the fluid . 
This results in a decrease in the signal intensity and slight increase in the signal width. 
The  plot  of  peak  value  of  normal  deflection  signal  as  a  function  of    y  for  different 
values of diffusivity/ conductivity (not shown) also reveals similar dependence on Ds / 
ks  as  the  peak  value  of  tangential  deflection  signal.  The  peak  value  of    normal 
deflection is greater than that of the tangential deflection due to the increased distance 
from  heating  epicenter.  Furthermore,  its  gradient  is  much  smaller  than  that  of 
tangential  deflection.  This 
sample 
diffusivity/conductivity the peak value of the inverse focal length of the photothermal 
lens in the z direction is much smaller than that of in y  direction . 
  Figure 12 shows the effect of the modulation frequency on the tangential deflection 
signal.  The  signal  and  its  width  decrease  with  increasing  frequency  ,  as  expected. 
Decreasing  the  signal  width  with  increasing  modulation  frequency  shows  that  for 
larger frequency  the focal length of  photothermal lens in y direction decreases . The  
 

irrespective  of 

shows 

that 

the

plot of peak value of normal deflection signal as a function of  y for different values 
of modulation frequency (not shown) also reveals similar dependence on frequency as 
the peak value of tangential deflection signal.  
 
IV. Conclusions 
We  have  presented  a  detailed  theoretical  description  of  the  three  dimensional 
photothermal deflection, induced by modulated cw laser excitation,  for a three layer 
system  consisting  of  a  transparent  fluid  ,  an  optically  absorbing  solid  sample  and  a 
backing  material.  Some  of  the  important  results  are  the  following  :  (i)  the  laser 
induced  temperature  of  the  sample  surface  decreases  with  increasing  modulation 
frequency  of  the  pump  laser.  (ii)  The  effective  thermal  length  decreases  with 
increasing  modulation  frequency  ,  thereby  making  the  decay  of  photothermal  signal 
with z faster. (iii) As the modulation frequency increases the temperature distribution 
Tf0 decreases and gets narrower. (iv) As the distance from the surface of solid sample 
increases  the  deflection  signal(cid:31)intensity  decreases  and  its  width  increases.  (v)  The 
focal  length  of  the  photothermal  lens  ,  produced  by  the  heating  action  of  the  pump 
laser , in the z direction is much greater than that of in y direction. (vi) The increasing 
of  diffusivity/  conductivity  of  solid  sample  results  in  a  decrease  in  the  deflection 
signal intensity and slight increase in the signal width. (vii) The normal deflection is 
greater than the tangential deflection , while its gradient is much smaller than that of 
tangential  deflection.  (viii)  The  deflection  signal  and  its  width  decrease  with 
increasing modulation frequency.

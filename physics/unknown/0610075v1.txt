It  was  observed  that  samples  hung  above  a  thermoionic  current  exhibit  a  weight  decrease 
directly proportional to the intensity of the current. The observed phenomenon appears to be 
absolutely  new  and  unprecedented  in  the  literature  and  can  not  be  understood  in  the 
framework of the general relativity.  It is pointed out the possibility that this unexpected effect 
is connected with a possible correlation between gravity and electromagnetism.  
  
 
 

 

I. INTRODUCTION        
 
          It  will  be  described  an  experiment 
in  which  there  has  been  observed  a 
strong decrease in the weight of samples 
hung  above  a 
thermoionic  current 
produced inside a vacuum chamber. The 
percentage  of  weight  decrease  is  the 
same  for  samples  of  different  masses 
and  chemical  compositions.  The  effect 
does not seem to diminish with increases 
in elevation above the current. 
          This  unexpected  phenomenon 
appears  to  be  unprecedented  in  the 
literature.  On 
the 
experiment is simple of being performed, 
and can be easily replicated.

          The  cathode,  the  filament  and  the 
plate are made of tungsten.  
          Two piezoelectric sensors for force 
(S1,S2) are placed as shown in Fig.1, in 
order  to  measure  the  weight  of  the 
flow  of 
sample 
the 
thermoionic 
thermoionic current is null the sensor S1 
shows  the  normal  weight  of  the  sample. 
Note  that  there  is  a  central  disk  inside 
the  tube  to  support  the  sample.  Above 
this  disk  (very  close  to  the  disk)  it  is  the 
sensor  S2.    The  function  of  the  sensor 
S2  is  to  measure  the  weight  of  the 

current.  When

sample,  in  case  this  weight  becomes 
negative (inversion).  
 
          2. Conductivity Measurements. 
 
          Atmospheric  air  conductivity 
is 
proportional  to  both  the  atmospheric  ion 
concentration  η,  and 
the  average 
mobility  μ  of  the  air  ion  population. 
Molecular  ions  with  μ  >  0.5  cm2V-1s-1 
are  conventionally  defined  as  “small 
ions”  [1].  The  unipolar  air  conductivity 
airσ  can be written as

Typical surface values of atmospheric air

conductivity  are 
 
[2,3].  
          The  air  conductivity  between  the 
cathode  and  the  plate  is  much  greater 
than  these  values  due  to  the  large 
concentration of free electrons. It can be 
evaluated  by  comparing  the  Gauss’  law

IV. DISCUSSION 
 
          The  weight  behavior  of  our 
samples  shows  strong  variations,  which 
apparently  can  be  explained  as  due  to 
the thermoionic current, which flows from 
the cathode to plate. When this current is 
removed the effects disappear.  
          In  a  previous  work  [4]  we  have 
shown  that  when  an  alternating  electric 
current  passes  through  a  substance  its 
in 
gravitational  mass

          It  was  also  shown  that  there  is  an

V.CONCLUSION 
 
investigated 
          In 
(60Hz), 
the  samples 
decrease  strongly  with  the  increase  of 
the  intensity  of  the  thermoionic  current, 
and,  as  we  have  shown,  the  weight  of 
the  samples  can  even  become  negative 
(inversion).  
          The  experimental  observations 
described in this work are absolutely new 
and unprecedented. They tell us about a 
part  of  Gravitation  Theory  which 
is 
unknown.

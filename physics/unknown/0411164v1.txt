We present in this paper a method to recover the refractive index profile of graded 

waveguide  from  the  effective  indices  by  cubic  spline  interpolation  function.  It  is 

proved by numerical analysis of several typical index distributions that the refractive 

index  profile  can  be  reconstructed  closely  to  its  exact  profile  with  the  presented 

interpolation  model.  This  method  can  reliably  retrieve  index  profile  of  both 

more-mode (more than 4 guiding mode) and fewer-mode (2-4) waveguides.   

Index Terms:  Integrated optics, graded index waveguide, optical planar waveguide, 

refractive index recovery, cubic spline function.   

I.    INTRODUCTION 

The  refractive  index  profile  plays  a  fundamental  role  in  a  graded  index 

waveguide  as  it  can  give  significant  information  on  the  waveguide  propagation 

properties, thus the determination of the profile has attracted considerable interests at 

all times. The techniques used to solve this problem are classified to destructive and 

non-destructive method. In destructive approaches, samples must be processed before 

the  measurement,  such  as  reflectivity  profiling  [1],  ellipsometry  [2].  The 

non-destructive  method  takes  advantage  of  intact  waveguide  sample.  The  most 

commonly  used  method,  such  as  inverse  WKB  (IWKB)  method  [3]  and  improved 

IWKB  method  [4],  is  to  reconstruct  index  profile  from  measured  effective  indexes. 

The  methods  are  also  developed  [5]  to  deal  with  waveguides  with  fewer  modes. 

However,  WKB  analysis  is  an  approximate  method,  which  will  unavoidably  restrict 

the  accuracy  of  its  inverse  methods.  In  the  case  of  waveguides  supporting  fewer 

modes other techniques such as changing the cover layer should be added, making the 

recovery process very complicated. In this paper, an interpolation method with cubic 

spline  function  [6]  based  on  an  exact  analytic  transfer  matrix  (ATM)  method  [7]  is 

introduced  to  recover  the  refractive  index  profile  from  effective  indexes.  The  cubic 

splines can get a quite smooth profile as it ensures that the first and second derivatives 

at each interpolation point are continuous, which is consistent with the real situation. 

With an iterative procedure this method can recover the exact index profile with good 

accuracy. 

 

II.    RECOVERY PROCESS 

A  series  of  mode  indexes 

=

0,1,...,

k

)  of  graded-index  waveguide  can  be 

in (

i

measured  by  m-lines  method  [8].  A  set  of  increasing  coordinate 

ix (

i

=

0,1,...,

k

)  is 

assumed arbitrarily to mode index{ }in , and the surface index is 

cn   (

cx = ), which 

0

is unknown and should be determined. Now we have a sets of points [( cn , 0), ( 0n ,

0x ), 

( 1n , 1x ), …, ( kn ,

kx )]. These points can be interpolated by cubic spline functions with 

a  smooth  profile.  In  order  to  work  out  the  unknown  surface  index 

cn ,  the  point 

( 0n ,

0x ) is picked out from the sets of points. So the series of points [( cn , 0), ( 1n , 1x ), 

( 2n ,

2x ),  …,  ( kn ,

kx )]  except  point  ( 0n ,

0x )  are  finally  used  to  fit  the  cubic  splines. 

When 

x

x≥
k

,  an  exponential  profile  is  assumed,  thus  according  to  the  interpolation 

theory of cubic spline function, the index profile can be described as follows:

Because of the surface index

added to the system of linear equations, so that all of the unknown parameters can be 

solved. This added condition is that the point ( 0n ,

0x ) lies in the curve from ( cn , 0) to 

( 1n , 1x ), which can be depicted as:

Finally, for an arbitrarily given series of  { }ix , the index distribution can be fitted 

with a very smooth profile according to the continuous first and second derivatives of 

all  cubic  spline  functions,  even  at  the  interpolation  points  [( 1n ,

1x ),  ( 2n ,

2x ),  …, 

(

1kn − ,

1kx − )]. Then we use an exact analytic transfer matrix (ATM) method to solve the 

waveguide  with  this  fitting  index  profile  to  get  the  corresponding  effective  indexes

as the phase contribution of the subwaves. Details about this ATM method are in [7]. 

After solving the interpolated index distribution a new series of effective index 

{
in

}cal

  is obtained. Simultaneously, a new series of  { }ix   is acquired. We define and 

calculate  the  departure  of  the  effective  indexes  between  calculated  values  and  exact 

values as 

∆ =

cal

(

n

−

n

)

. We can evaluate this deviation, if it is still large enough, 

k

∑

we substitute the new series of  { }ix   to Equation (1), and a new index profile can be 

fitted with interpolation on the new series of points. Series effective indexes  {

}cal

 

in

and  { }ix can  be  determined  by  the  solution  of  the  new  index  distribution  in  the 

waveguide  with  ATM  method.  Repeating  the  above  approach  the  deviation  ∆   will 

get smaller and smaller, that is, this iteration process is convergent and the profile is 

approaching to the real profile. When  ∆   is close to zero, the refractive index profile 

is finally acquired.   

 

It should be noted that for the facility of the iteration procedure the first series of 

{ }ix should be chosen so that the waveguide of the fitting profile have enough guiding 

modes.  We  can  choose  { }ix   as  arithmetic  series  and  the  interval  is  chosen  to  be 

8λ λ∼ , where  λis the wavelength in air.

In  previous  discussion  we  have  noted  that 

n

' (0)

,  the  first  derivative  of 

( )n x at 

the  surface 

x = ,  is  given  and  may  be  altered.  For  a  given 

0

n

' (0)

,  the  obtained 

profile may be impractical. Because the second derivative can reflect the concave and 

convex character of the curve, practicability of the index distribution can be judged by 

investigation  on  the  series  of  second  derivatives 

iM i
(

=

k
0,1,..., )

,  as  for  a  practical 

refractive index profile the signs of 

=

0,1,..., )
k

have special rules. We have the 

(
iM i

judge rule that every sign of  {

}iM   before the first positive sign should be negative 

and every sign of  {

}iM   after the first positive sign should be positive, or all of signs 

of  {

}iM   are  positive.  As  we  know,  for  most  of  graded  index  profiles  such  as 

Gaussian profile, error function profile, Fermi profile and exponential profile, 

n

' (0)

 

is less than or equal to zero. At first, we set 

n

' (0) 0

= , and under this value we can get 

a convergent profile. Then, if the signs of  {

}iM in the profile satisfy the judge rule, 

the  practical  index  profile  is  acquired,  and  if  the  signs  of  {

}iM   don’t  satisfy  the 

judge rule, 

n

' (0)

  should be decreased until  {

}iM   from the calculated profile accord 

with the judge rule. It is proved by simulation results that from a series of effective 

indexes  { }in   the index distribution can be precisely recovered very close to its exact 

profile with the iteration approach and the judge rule. 

 

III.  NUMERICAL RESULTS AND COMPARISON 

In  order  to  investigate  the  reliability  of  this  method,  we  give  some  typical 

examples  of  graded  index  profiles  such  as  Gaussian,  error  function,  Fermi  and 

exponential  profile.  The  cover  layer  is  uniformly  the  air  with  index 

an =

1.0

.  All 

numerical simulations are performed with wavelength of 632.8 nm and unit of length 

in  micrometer.  Every  index  profile  in  waveguides  is  also  calculated  under  different 

mode numbers to verify the universality of the current method.   

 

Firstly we consider waveguides with index distribution of Gaussian profile, which 

is  described  as 

n x

( ) 1.5 0.025exp(
+

=

−

2
x D
/

gauss

2

)

, 

gaussD

  varies  from  3 mµ   to 

7 mµ , allowing the waveguides to support 3~7 modes. All waveguides have uniform 

surface  index  with  the  value  of  1.525.  The  numerical  results  are  demonstrated  in 

Fig.1(a).  A  good  superposition  can  be  observed  between  the  exact  and  calculated 

profiles in the guiding region. Some discrepancy exists in the retrieved profiles after 

the  last  mode  because  an  exponential  profile  is  assumed  when 

x

x≥
k

  in  our 

calculations.  The  next  example  is  implemented  in  waveguides  with  error  function 

profile,  which  is  depicted  as

where erfn =0.01, 0.02, 0.035, 0.045, corresponding to surface index, can stimulate 3, 4, 

5 and 6 modes, respectively. The results are shown in Fig.1(b). The recovered values 

of 

erfn   for  each  waveguide  are  0.00998,  0.02012,  0.03516,  0.04518,  which  agree 

well with the exact values. Similar results are also obtained with exponential profile

, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig.1(d). 

To further verify the reliability of our method, we consider waveguides with only 

two guiding modes. Because of the invalidation of the judge rule on only 2 derivatives 

of  the  second  order  we  just  predict  Gaussian,  error  function  and  slowly  changing 

Fermi  profiles  except  exponential  profile,  which  can  uniformly  be  calculated  with

  are  1.5108  and  1.5033, 

respectively.  The 

calculated result is shown in Fig.2 (a), which also agrees well with the exact profile as 

the  above  simulations.  Fig.2  (b) 

is  achieved  from  error  function  profile

which 

supports  two  guiding  modes  with  effective  indexes  of  1.5099  and  1.5020.  The 

obtained  surface  index  is  1.51792,  very  close  to  the  exact  value.  Although  the 

obtained  index  distribution  of  Fermi  profile 

n x =

( ) 1.5+0.018/{1+exp[ ( -2.5)/0.7 ]}

x

 

expects  a  less  accurate  achievement,  the  result  still  give  a  good  prescription  on  the 

index amplitude and depth of the waveguide, as shown in Fig.2(c).   

In  comparison  with 

IWKB  method  we  consider  a  Gaussian  profile 

n x

( ) 1.5 0.025 exp(

−

x

  supporting  5  guiding  modes.  The  effective  indexes 

are 1.519 95, 1.513 75, 1.508 43, 1.504 11, 1.501 07, respectively. Recovered profiles 

by IWKB and the current method are shown in Fig.3. It can be found that the current 

method  can  estimate  the  index  profile  in  more  accuracy  than  IWKB  method, 

especially in the recovery of surface index.       

 

 

   

IV.    CONCLUSION   

In  summary,  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  refractive  index  profile  of  graded 

index  waveguide  can  be  smoothly  recovered  in  good  accuracy  with  cubic  spline 

interpolation functions based on exact ATM method and simply iterative approaches. 

This  method  can  uniformly  predict  multimode  waveguides  with  more  modes  and 

fewer  modes  reliably  from  the  effective  indexes.  It  can  also  be  used  to  investigate 

untypable  profiles  from  measurement  of  effective  indexes  by  changing  the  value  of 

n

' (0)

and  investigation  on  the  second  derivatives.  The  explicit  analysis  provides  a 

reliable and convenient technique in the approach of graded index profiling.

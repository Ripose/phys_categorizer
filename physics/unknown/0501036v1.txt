Abstract  —  The  design  and  performance  of  a  1.2 liter  liquid 
xenon  chamber  equipped  with  7 two-inch photomultiplier tubes, 
with  the  purpose  of  studying  the  scintillation  response  of  xenon 
to  g-rays and neutrons, is described. Measurements with   g-rays 
indicate  a  high  VUV  light  collection  efficiency  resulting  in 
~5.5 photoelectrons  per  1 keV  of  deposited  energy.  The  energy 
resolution  (FWHM)  is  18%  and  22%,  for  122 keV and 511 keV 
g-rays,  respectively.  An  algorithm  for  the  reconstruction  of  the 
scintillation  coordinates  in  (x,y) plane was developed and tested. 
The position resolution is estimated to be  s=6.9 mm for 122 keV 
g-rays.  

I.  INTRODUCTION 

L 

IQUID  xenon  detectors  are  increasingly  considered  as  a 
powerful  instrument  for  a  direct  search  of  weakly 
interactive massive particles (WIMP) which might constitute a 
significant fraction of the non-luminous matter in the Universe 
[1].  Due  to  the  proximity  of  the  mass  of  the  xenon  nucleus 
(A=130)  to  some  estimates  of  the  WIMP  mass,  the  energy 
transfer  from  a  WIMP  to  xenon  nuclei  in  elastic  collisions  is 
maximized.  As  the  expected  energy  distribution  of  nuclear 
recoils  decreases  rapidly  with  energy,  the  detection  threshold 
must be as low as possible. At present, several experiments are 
aiming at achieving sensitivity to nuclear recoils in the energy 
range  from  a  few  keV  to  some  tens  of  keV.  Thus,  detailed 
knowledge  of  the  response  of  liquid  xenon  to  low  energy 
nuclear recoils is of the utmost importance.  

Both  scintillation  efficiency  and  the  decay  time  of  liquid 
xenon are known to depend on the ionization density along the 
particle  track.  The  determination  of  the  light  yield  per  unit  of 
deposited  energy  for  nuclear  recoils  with  respect  to  that  for 
electrons  of  the  same  energy  (frequently  called  quenching 
factor)  is  important  for  accessing  the  energy  spectrum  of 
detected  recoils,  given  that  the  detector  calibration  is  usually 
(and more conveniently) performed with  g -rays. Moreover, the

differences in the scintillation decay times from nuclear recoils 
and from electrons allow these signals to be distinguished  and 
the background from g  and b  rays rejected. 

Given its high atomic number, high density, high scintillation 
light yield and fast decay time, liquid xenon is also known to be 
a  very  good  medium  for  efficient  detection  of  g -rays.  These 
properties are intended to be exploited in a 4p
 g -ray scintillation 
calorimeter for measurements of neutron capture cross sections 
in a wide range of neutron energies, whose feasibility study is in 
the program of the n-TOF Collaboration at CERN [2]. Such a 
calorimeter  should  detect  g -ray  cascades  following  neutron 
capture in a target nucleus with 100% efficiency, good energy 
resolution  and  high  counting  rate.  It  has  to  be  operated  at  a 
neutron  beam  under  a  significant  background  of  scattered 
neutrons. Again, the separation of the signals due to g -rays from 
those due to neutrons is very important. 

In the present paper we describe the design of a liquid xenon 
scintillation chamber which was  built to study the scintillation 
efficiency and decay time due to nuclear recoils and g -rays. First 
results  are  also  presented.  Although  the  chamber  is  presently 
operated without electric field, its design allows future studies 
under an applied electric field. 

II.  CHAMBER DESIGN 

The  chamber,  the  thermal  insulation,  as  well  as  the 
liquefaction  and  cooling  techniques,  were  designed  having  in 
mind the need to minimize the amount of material around the 
liquid  xenon  volume,  in  view  of  its  operation  in  a  neutron 
beam. 

A.  Chamber 
A simplified drawing of the chamber is shown in Fig. 1. The 
liquid  xenon  chamber  is  a  stainless  steel  cylindrical  vessel 
(˘ 200 mm,  278 mm  high)  with  a  thickness  of  0.4 mm in the 
lateral  wall  and  6 mm at the bottom. This vessel is suspended 
inside  another  cylinder  kept  under  vacuum,  for  thermal 
insulation.  The  outer  cylinder  is  made  of  aluminium,  0.8 mm 
thick,  reinforced  with  ~3 mm  of  carbon  fiber  epoxy  glued  on 
the air side. 

 The  active  volume  of  liquid  xenon  (about  1.2 liter)  is 
defined  by  PTFE  reflectors  arranged  to  form  a  cylinder, 
˘ 163 mm and 55 mm high. The bottom of this cylinder is made 
from a 4 mm thick PTFE sheet, whereas the lateral surface and 
the top disk (with 7 openings for the PMTs) have a thickness of 

 

 

1 mm.  The  active  volume  is  viewed  by  an  array  of  7 
photomultipliers Hamamatsu R2154 in direct contact with the 
liquid  xenon,  their  entrance  windows  immersed  in  order  to 
maximize  the  light  collection.  The  photomultipliers  have 
2-
inch  quartz  window  and  bialkaline  photocathode.  Metal 
fingers  are  deposited  under  the  photocathode  to  reduce  its 
resistivity at low temperature. The PMT photocathodes are kept 
at ground potential. The quantum efficiency at the wavelength 
of 175 nm varies from tube to tube, between 21% and 25% at 
room temperature, as quoted by the manufacturer.

the  chamber  (to  scale)  and  xenon 

 
Xenon  is  introduced  into  the  chamber  through  an  inlet 
stainless  steel  tube,  which  passes  in  vacuum  through  the 
aluminium flange of the outer chamber. The condenser consists 
of  a  helix  gas  tube  in  good  thermal  contact  with  a  massive 
copper  block  connected  by  a  thick  copper  rod  to  a  liquid 
nitrogen  container.  The  condenser  was  filled  with  alcohol to 
improve  the  heat  transfer  and  ensure  a  more  uniform 
temperature along the helix. 

B.  Xenon Purification, Liquefaction and Re-circulation 
High purity commercial xenon gas was purified in a portable 
purification  system  by  passing  the  gas  through  an  Oxisorb 
column several times prior to condensing it into the chamber. 
The chamber and all connections to the purification system are 

primarily  pumped  down  to  ~10-6 mbar  under  heating  during 
several days. The connecting tubes are heated to a temperature 
of  about  200 ºC,  though  the  chamber  is  kept  at  70 ºC,  the 
these  PMTs. 
maximum  storage 
Afterwards, xenon is introduced into the hot chamber. For the 
next several days, xenon gas is kept circulating through both the 
chamber and the Oxisorb column, at room temperature.  

temperature  quoted  for 

The  chamber  is  cooled  down  by  liquid  xenon,  which  is 
condensed in the helix condenser (see Fig. 1) and drops into the 
chamber  under  gravity.  The  evaporated  xenon  gas  is  returned 
into  the  condenser  through  the  chamber  outlet,  in  a  closed 
cycle. 
  Once  the  chamber  bottom  reaches  liquid  xenon 
temperature,  about  - 90 ºC  at  vapor  pressure  of  2.5 bar,  the 
condensing of gas is started. 

The  liquid  level  is  monitored  during  the  condensation 
process by observing  signals from the photomultipliers when a 
57Co g -ray  source  (122 keV)  is  placed  below  the  chamber 
bottom, under its center. A sharp increase of the amplitude, by a 
factor of ~2, is observed when the liquid level is high enough to 
cover  the  entrance  window  of  the  respective  photomultiplier. 
Condensing  is  continued  for  some  time,  allowing  the  liquid 
surface to raise well above the photomultiplier windows.  

The  chamber  is  operated  at  the  xenon  vapor  pressure  of 
2.5 bar.  During  operation,  the  temperature  of  the  helix 
condenser  is  always  about  –100 ºC.  The  temperature  of  the 
chamber is maintained stable by the xenon dripping in. The gas 
could be circulated either directly, or through the purification 
system, so that it can be permanently purified before returning 
to the condenser and chamber.   

III.  FRONT END AND DATA ACQUISITION 

Each  of  the  7  photomultiplier  tubes  is  connected  to  a  low 
noise  charge-sensitive  preamplifier  followed  by  a  shaping 
amplifier,  both  specially  developed  for  this  experiment [3], as 
shown  in  Fig. 2.  The  preamplifiers  have  an  input  noise  of 
~1 fC,  5 ns  risetime  and  a  falltime  of  500  ns.  The  shaping 
amplifiers have an active  CR-(RC)2 filter with a characteristic 
time of 250 ns and an adjustable output gain.  The signal from 
each preamplifier is also inverted, fed into a fast amplifier and 
then  sent  to  a  constant  fraction  discriminator.  The  outputs  of 
these discriminators are sent to a logic sum unit to generate the 
trigger,  by  a  coincidence  of  2  or  more  signals.  The  trigger  is 
used  to  generate  both  the  GATE  for  the  peak-ADCs  and  the 
START  for  the  TDCs.  The  STOP signals  for  the  TDCs  are 
provided by the discriminators, after a suitable delay.  

After  integration  by  the  charge-sensitive  preamplifiers  and 
filtering by the shaping amplifiers the signals from each   PMT 
are sent to a multichannel peak-ADC unit. The timing signal of 
each photomultiplier  is fed into a multichannel TDC unit. The 
ADC and TDC data are acquired by a computer and stored for 
further analysis. We refer to [3] for more details.

IV.  RESULTS WITH GAMMA-RAYS 

A.  Setup and Calibration 
Measurements  with  g -rays  were  performed  using  a  57Co 
(122 keV plus 136 keV in a 10:1 ratio) and 22Na (511 keV plus 
1.2 MeV)  sources.  The  57Co  source  was  placed  under  the 
chamber,  inside  the  vacuum  cryostat  (see  Fig. 1). The source 
can  be  moved  from  the  outside  and  placed  either  at  a  fixed 
position under any of 7 photomultipliers or enclosed in a small 
lead  container.  Seven  1 mm  thick  and  ˘ 8 mm windows have 
the  chamber  bottom,  below  each 
been  machined 
photomultiplier (see Fig. 1). Additionally, a lead mask has been 
placed  below  the  bottom  of  the  chamber  with  ˘ 8 mm  holes 
aligned with the windows referred above.  

in 

For the 511 keV g -rays, the chamber was irradiated laterally 
from a distance of about 40 cm. Pairs of 511 keV photons were 
selected by means of coincidences with a cylindrical ˘ 2· 2 inch 
crystal of BaF2. 

Each  acquisition  channel  was  calibrated  with  respect  to  the 
PMT gain  at the operating temperature with a short light pulse 
(<300 ns)  from  a  green  LED  by  acquiring  the  single  electron 
spectra from the respective PMT. The LED was placed outside 
the  liquid  xenon  chamber  in  the  vacuum  shell  close  to  the 
electrical  feedthroughs,  so  that  the  light  emitted  by  the  diode 
could  penetrate 
the  ceramic 
the  chamber 
insulators. The calibration was periodically checked during the 
measurements.

B.  Light Collection Efficiency and Energy Resolution 
The pulse height spectrum measured with 122 keV g -rays for 
the source placed below the central window is shown in Fig. 3 
(a).  The  spectrum  in  Fig. 3  (b)  was  obtained  with  511 keV g -
rays  at  the  conditions  referred  above.  All  signals  from  all 
photomultiplier  tubes  were  recorded,  provided  that  a  trigger 
occurred.  Offline,  after  calibration,  the  PMT  amplitudes  are 
converted  to  number  of  photoelectrons  and  added  with  equal 
weights. An energy resolution (FWHM) of about 18% and 22% 
was obtained for 122 keV and 511 keV, respectively.  

It is important to point out that the light collection is quite 
different  for  the  two  g -ray  energies.  For  122 keV  g -rays  the 
attenuation  length  in  liquid  xenon  is  about  3 mm  and  photo-

absorption  dominates.  Thus,  the  majority  of  the  g -rays  that 
reach the active volume are absorbed in a very thin layer of the 
liquid, compared to the height of the chamber. For 511 keV g -
rays,  though,  the  attenuation  length  is  about  3.5 cm  and 
photoelectric  absorption 
the 
coincidence cone used in these measurements was rather large 
causing 
to  be  widely  distributed 
throughout the active volume. Therefore, the non-uniformity of 
the VUV light collection over the chamber volume is higher in 
the case of the more energetic g -rays (see Fig. 4). This fact may 
explain  the  worse  energy  resolution  for  511 keV  than  for 
122 keV,  contrary  to  what  could  be  expected,  taking  into 
account  only  the  number  of  scintillation  photons  produced  in 
liquid xenon.

From these measurements we arrive at an overall conversion 
efficiency  of  ~5.5  photoelectrons  per  1  keV  of  deposited 
energy.  This  corresponds  to  a  collection  of  about  half  the 
emitted VUV photons, assuming that the mean energy required 
to produce one photon is Ws = 20 eV [4]-[6] and the quantum 
efficiency is 20% for all PMTs.

C.  Time Resolution 
The time resolution was measured with 511 keV g -rays with 
the chamber in coincidence with the BaF2 detector, which gives 
the START signal for the TDC. The STOP signal is provided by 
the  trigger  signal  of  the  chamber.  The  time  resolution  was 
determined as a function of the energy deposited by Compton 
scattering  in  the  active  volume.  The  results  are  shown  in 
Table 1.

D.   Monte Carlo 
Two  independent  Monte  Carlo  simulation  models  were 
developed. The first model is a detailed Geant4 [7] based Monte 
Carlo simulation of the detector and of the experimental setup. 
It covers several aspects of the experiment, from the generation 
of  g -rays  in  the  57Co  source  and  their  interactions  with  the 
chamber  to  the  production  and  propagation  of  the  resulting 
scintillation photons in liquid xenon. For the treatment of  g -ray 
low-energy  
the 
interactions, 
electromagnetic  processes  of  Geant4  are  used,  which  include 
Compton scattering, photoelectric effect and the emission of X-
rays  and  Auger  electrons  from 
the  excited  atom.  The 
propagation  of  the  scintillation  photons  in  liquid  xenon  and 
their  interaction  with  the  various  elements  of  the  chamber is 
simulated  using  the  optical  processes,  also  from  Geant4,  in 
particular the Rayleigh scattering, the light absorption and the 
refraction/reflection.  

The  other  model  is  a  standalone  simulation  of  light 
propagation  within  the  active  volume  of  the  detector. It takes 
into account the Rayleigh scattering and the light absorption in 
the liquid, as well as the refraction and reflection at the optical 
surfaces,  too,  but  uses  independent  (not  from  GEANT4) 
subroutines for those processes. 

Both  simulations  are  performed  with  the  mean  energy 
required  to  produce  a  scintillation  photon  being  Ws = 20 eV 
[4]-[6]  and  the  quantum  efficiencies  of  all  PMTs  set  to  20%. 
The PTFE reflectivity and the absorption and scattering lengths, 
l abs  and  l
scat,  respectively,  for  the  VUV  photons  have  been 
varied.  

The absorption and scattering lengths for the VUV photons 
in  liquid  xenon  are  not  known,  at  present.  However,  several 
authors have reported a value of about 30 cm to 40 cm for the 
total  attenuation  length  (see  [8],  [9]  and  references  therein). 
which

Using

abs,  and  assuming  that  l
scat  (i.e.  no 
absorption),  we  adjusted  the  simulated  total  number  of 
photoelectrons to that obtained experimentally and arrive at a 
lower limit for the PTFE reflectivity of 0.87– 0.03. This value 
is compatible with results reported in [10]. 

tot=35 cm,

sets 

In a similar way, but setting the PTFE reflectivity to 1 and 
tot=35 cm, we tried to estimate limits for l
scat, which 
would  lead  the  simulation  to  agreed  with  experimental  data. 
The  result  is  a  lower  limit  for  the  absorption  length  of  about 
40 cm  and  an  upper  limit  for  the  scattering  length  of  about 
200 cm.  The  important  point  is  that  agreement  can  only  be 
reached assuming the existence of Rayleigh scattering in liquid 
xenon for its scintillation light. 

abs and l

The  above  estimates  were  confirmed  using  a  standalone 
Monte Carlo model. In this case, the ratio of the simulated total 
number of photoelectrons at two positions of the  57Co source 
(see  Fig. 5)  was  adjusted to that observed experimentally. The 
advantage of such approach is that this ratio is independent of 
the values set for the quantum efficiency and Ws, as the number 
of  photoelectrons  at  each  source  position  is  proportional  to 
their  product.  The  result  for  a  lower  limit  for  the  PTFE 
reflectivity  and  the  limits  for  the  absorption  and  scattering 
lengths are in excellent agreement with those obtained with the 
GEANT4 based model. 

E.  Position Reconstruction 
A  simple  algorithm  of  2-D  position  reconstruction  was 
implemented.  It  is  based  on  a  Monte  Carlo  simulation  of  the 
light  collection  efficiency  for  each  photomultiplier,  for 
scintillation events close to the chamber bottom. The resulting 
amplitude distributions for the 7 PMTs are stored in a look-up 
table  for  a  set  of  (x,y)  points  in  steps  of  1  mm.  For  each 
measured event a look-up table search was performed, using a 
least-squares  method.  Fig. 5  shows  reconstructed  images  for 
122 keV g -rays  for  two  positions  of  the  source.  The position 
resolution at the bottom center is estimated to be  s
 = 6.9 mm, 
taking into account the dimensions of the collimator.

V.  CONCLUSIONS 
The measurements with  g -rays show that a rather high VUV 
light collection efficiency is achievable with the present design, 
due to the PTFE surfaces surrounding the liquid xenon active 
volume.  The  total  number  of  photoelectrons  collected  at  the 
PMT  photocathodes  is  ~5.5 photoelectrons  per  1 keV  of 
deposited  energy.  Energy  resolutions  (FWHM)  of  18%  and 
22%  were  obtained  with  122 keV  and  511 keV g -rays, 
respectively. 

The  time  resolution  was  measured  with  511 keV g -rays. 
Values of 3.0 ns to 4.4 ns, FWHM, were obtained for deposited 
energies ranging from 105 keV down to 20 keV. These values 
are sufficient for distinguishing the fast and slow components 
of xenon scintillation decay. 

The Monte Carlo simulation of the detector points to a PTFE 
reflectivity  above  85%  and  to  the  existence  of  Rayleigh 
scattering of the xenon scintillation light in liquid xenon. 

A  position  reconstruction  algorithm  was  developed  and 
proved  to  be  feasible.  It  may  be  helpful  also  for  rejecting 
multiple scintillation events in the active volume, for example, 
those  due  to  multiple  elastic  scattering  in  experiments  with 
neutrons.  Moreover,  it  may  lead  to  the  improvement  of  the 
energy resolution through the correction for non-uniformity of 
the light collection. 

The  results  obtained,  namely  the  high  light  collection 
efficiency  (equivalent  to  a  low  detection  threshold),  the  time 
and  position  resolutions,  together  with  the  performance of the 
readout  system,  the  thermodynamic  stability  and  the  purity  of 
the chamber, indicate that this chamber is suitable for accurate 
and highly sensitive measurements with neutrons.

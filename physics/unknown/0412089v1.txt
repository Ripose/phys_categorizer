We present the design, fabrication and experimental validation of a novel device that 

exploits the amplification of displacement and attenuation of structural stiffness in the 

post-buckling  deformation  of  slender  columns  to  obtain  pico-Newton  force  and 

nanometer displacement resolution even under an optical microscope. The extremely 

small  size,  purely  mechanical  sensing  scheme  and  vacuum  compatibility  of  the 

instrument  makes  it  compatible  with  existing  visualization  tools  of  nanotechnology. 

The  instrument  has  a  wide  variety  of  potential  applications  ranging  from  electro-

mechanical characterization of one dimensional solids to single biological cells.

      Displacement and force are two generic mechanical quantities that pervade broad classes 

of sensors and actuators. Experimental studies in nanoscale science and technology, such as 

intermolecular  interactions,  surface  and  interfacial  forces  and  coupling  of  thermo-electro-

mechanical  properties  of  nanotubes  and  nanowires  call  for  very  high  resolution  force  and 

displacement  sensing.  A  number  of  instruments,  such  as  the  atomic  force  microscopes 

(AFM),  optical  traps,  nano-indenters  and  micro-electro-mechanical  (MEMS)  systems  [1] 

have  been  developed  to  meet  these  stringent  resolution  requirements.  Among  these,  AFM 

and its derivatives are predominantly used in contemporary nanotechnology research. In this 

technique, the bending of thin cantilever beams with low stiffness is used to sense very small 

forces.  Force  is  measured  as  the  product  of  probe  stiffness  and  tip  displacement  (usually 

measured  by  photo-diodes  with  angstrom  resolution).  Commercial  probe  microscopes  can 

have  stiffness  as  low  as  0.01  N/m  and  hence  can  resolve  force  in  the  pico-Newton  range. 

Even though AFM performance has been continually improved [2, 3], it is practically limited 

by factors such as precision of fabrication, stiffness calibration, thermo-mechanical noise and 

structural  instability  (sample  tip  interaction,  snap-in).  High  vacuum  and  ultra-low 

temperature operation [4, 5] can significantly enhance the force resolution, but at the cost of 

restricting the experiment to specific environments. Novel approaches in sensing such as the 

resonant  probe  [6]  can  result  in  very  high  force  resolution,  as  demonstrated  in  [2]  with  9 

nano-Newton for a 500 N/m stiffness probe. Applications of these techniques are also limited 

to specific operating environments.  

      MEMS-based force sensors, on the other hand, lag behind probe microscopy because of 

the  superior  displacement  resolution  of  the  latter  [1,  7,  8].  MEMS  applications  are  also 

environment specific. For example, electrostatic (such as capacitive) sensors cannot perform 

 

2

in  electrolytic  solutions  or  in  the  presence  of  electromagnetic  fields,  which  makes  the 

sensing/actuating  scheme  very  important  for  MEMS  devices.  However,  their  small  size 

results  in  the  unique  advantage  of  compatibility  with  various  forms  of  high  resolution 

microscopy  for  in-situ  experimentation  [9].  In-situ  tests  give  us  not  only  quantitative  and 

qualitative  data  simultaneously,  but  also  allow  the  direct  observation  of  the  events  during 

experiments, which becomes increasingly important as the length scale of the test specimens 

is reduced  to  the nanoscale.  This  feature makes MEMS sensors and actuators attractive for 

nanoscale experimentation.  

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  novel  force  and  displacement  sensor  design  that  has  force 

resolution comparable to probe microscopy and has very small overall size (1 mm x 1mm). 

The device can achieve pico-Newton force resolution, even under an optical microscope (1 

micron  displacement  resolution),  which  compares  favorably  to  probe  microscopes  where 

angstrom level displacement sensors are required to achieve the same force resolution. The 

device operation is purely mechanical in nature and is unaffected by the type of environment 

(air, vacuum, aqueous, electromagnetic, electrolytic). The extremely small size of the device 

makes  it  compatible  to  almost  all  the  visualization  tools  in  nanotechnology  (AFM,  SEM, 

TEM, STM) as well as fluorescence based bio-technology. 

The design philosophy exploits post-buckling deformation mechanics of slender columns. 

A column acts as a very rigid element until a critical buckling load is applied. After that, the 

column  collapses  with  large  lateral  displacements  for  very  small  incremental  loads.  As 

shown in Figure 1(A), the axial deformation of a buckled beam (δ) is amplified by the lateral 

displacement (D) as,

For  the  beam  material  and  geometry  shown  in  Figure  1(B),  1  micron  of  lateral 

displacement (easily resolved by optical microscopes) represents about 5 nanometers of axial 

displacement. While this displacement amplification phenomenon has been utilized before by 

numerous researchers, the sudden attenuation of beam stiffness (after critical buckling load 

of 180 µN shown in Figure 1(B)) has so far been viewed as an undesired/failure phenomenon. 

The  axial  force-lateral  displacement  (P-D)  relationship  given  below  predicts  that  structural 

stiffness as low as 0.0177x10-3 N/m  is achievable. No other structural configuration  allows 

such small stiffness without loss in stability.

Here κ is the lowest flexural rigidity, ξ is the initial imperfection and

.  

In  this  study,  for  the  first  time,  we  exploit  the  post-buckling  structural  stiffness 

attenuation along with displacement amplification to  design a high resolution MEMS force 

and  displacement  sensor.  A  scanning  electron  micrograph  of  the  sensor  is  shown  in  figure 

2(A). Here two sets of slender silicon beams (ab/a’b’ and cd/c’d’) are connected to a center 

platform,  all  of  which  are  released  from  the  silicon  substrate.  The  beams  ab  and  a’b’  are 

slightly shorter than the cd and c’d’ beams. We use a piezo-motor to apply displacement at 

the  dd’  end,  while  keeping  aa’  end  fixed.  Any  misalignment  of  the  displacement  is 

neutralized by the auto-alignment beams, which ensure purely axial compressive loads being 

applied  to  the  slender  beams.  The  cd  and  c’d’  beams  buckle  first  and  upon  continued 

displacement, they apply enough load on the beams ab and a’b’ to buckle them. After this, 

 

4

the center platform can be assumed to be a rigid body connected in series with two springs 

with ultra-low stiffness values. Figure 2(B) shows optical micrograph of such a configuration. 

It is important to note that the symmetric buckling can be ensured by introducing very small 

initial  imperfection  (using  lithography).  Figure  2(C)  shows  zoomed  schematic  view  of  the 

nano-mechanical testing specimen. One end of this specimen is kept fixed with the substrate 

while  the  other  end  is  attached  to  the  movable  center  platform.  The  position  of  the  fixed 

specimen end, with respect to the center platform motion, therefore determines the nature of 

the applied load (tensile or compressive). At any point in time, the force on the specimen is 

given by:  

 

           (3)  

Pspecimen = Pcd + Pc’d’ – Pab – Pa’b’    

 

 

 

 

 

The  displacement  in  the  specimen  is  given  by  the  axial  displacement  of  the  center 

platform (or that of the beams ab or a’b’). Therefore, by reading the lateral displacements in 

the  buckled  beams  and  using  equations  1  and  2,  we  can  apply  and  measure  pico-Newton 

level  force  and  nanometer  level  displacement  in  a  specimen,  which  makes  the  device 

attractive  for  nano-mechanical  testing.  Figure  2(D)  shows  an  individual  freestanding 

multiwalled carbon nanotube sandwiched between polymer layers (fabricated using the same 

processes as the device) that can be used as a nano-mechanical or interfacial test specimen. 

Figure 2(E) shows a single mouse myeloma cell compressively loaded by the device. 

The device operation was simulated using a commercial finite element package ANSYS. 

Typical device parameters and the resulting force and displacement resolutions are given in 

Table 1. Devices with chosen parameters were patterned on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer 

using photo-lithography and subsequently etched with deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). The 

 

5

movable  beams  and  the  center  platform  were  released  from  the  substrate  using  a  HF-

methanol  vapor  phase  oxide  etch.  It  is  important  to  note  that  cofabrication  of  nanoscale 

specimens (as shown in figure 2(D), which is based on the same fabrication processing steps) 

with  the  device  is  possible.  For  nano-electro-mechanical  testing,  the  device  can  be  coated 

with metal films as electrically isolated conductors.  

Process uncertainties during lithography and etching may result in significant variation in 

simulated and actual device performance. To calibrate the device, we cofabricate two guided 

cantilever beams that can be characterized in the SEM for a very close approximation of their 

spring constant. We then apply and measure load and corresponding displacement on these 

beams  using  the  procedure  described  above.  We  also  simulate  the  experiment  in  ANSYS 

while  varying  κ,  the  lowest  flexural  rigidity.  This  is  because  κ  is  the  link  between  the 

geometry  and  the  strength  of  materials.  We  then  tune  the  κ  value  to  match  the  simulated 

buckled  configurations  (values  of  the  lateral  displacements  of  the  sets  of  beams)  with  the 

experimentally observed ones. The κ value corresponding to the best match (shown in figure 

3) is taken to be the actual flexural rigidity of the buckling beams.  

After  calibration,  the  device  was  tested  with  a  simple  cantilever  beam  with  previously 

calibrated  spring  constant  of  0.5  N/m.  The  cantilever  was  placed  perpendicular  and  out  of 

plane of the device so that it could be loaded at the free end. Experimental data on the lateral 

displacements of the buckling beams were recorded and compared with ANSYS simulation, 

this time using the calibrated value of the flexural rigidity and other parameters constant. The 

experimental and the simulated data (shown in figure 4) matched very well and yielded the 

same  specimen  spring  constant  value.  The  testing  procedure  thus  corroborates  the  device 

calibration scheme as well.

The  MEMS-based  device  developed  in  this  study  can  apply  and  measure  pico-Newton 

level  force  and  nanometer  level  displacement  on  nano-mechanical  test  specimens.  The 

experimental  setup  requires  only  an  optical  microscope  for  raw  data  recording.  The  purely 

mechanical  nature  of  the  force  and  displacement  sensing  schemes  allows  the  device  to  be 

used  in  vacuum,  air,  liquid,  electromagnetic  environment.  The  extremely  small  size  of  the 

device  allows  in-situ  nano-mechanical  testing  with  the  existing  electron  and  probe 

microscopy  techniques  and  also  fluorescence-based  microscopy  for  mechano-biological 

experiments at the single cell level.

Micromegas  is  presently  in  use  by  many  experiments  providing  enhanced  performance  when  used  in  high  particle  environment. 
Compared  with  other  solid-state  detectors  or  conventional  gas  counters  Micromegas  is  robust  and  radiation  hard.  Recent 
improvements  in  the  design  and  fabrication  of  low-cost  Micromegas  have  led  to  a  significant  step  for  readout  of  large  volume 
detectors.  A  novel  Cherenkov  counter  with  Micromegas  photodetector  readout  is  proposed  for  on-line  particle  identification  and 
trigger at high rates.

The  next  generation  of  particle  detectors  and  next 
investigations  on  high  energy  and  nuclear  physics 
experiments  will  continue  to  push  the  limits  of  our 
current 
the  next 
generation  of  experiments  will  require  much  more 
precise and accurate detectors with the ability to obtain 
high  precision  under  extreme  irradiation  conditions.  
To  meet  this  demand  the  new  gaseous  detector 
Micromegas    has  been  invented  in 1996. The  concept 
MicroMegas 
(MicroMEsh  GAseous  Structure), 
developed  for  tracking  applications,  has  shown  great 
promise for handling high data rates with a rather low- 
cost  structure.  The  working  principle  is  based  on  the 
double  stage  parallel  plate  avalanche  chamber 
described in details in previous papers [1,2,3,4].

The use of a narrow gap (25-150 μm) is key element 
to  great 
in 
performance 
relative 
immunity  to  defects  in  flatness,  and  excellent  energy 
resolution [2,5]. The small amplification gap produces 
a narrow avalanche giving rise to excellent spatial and 
time  resolution:  12  μm  accuracy  has  been  already 
reached  while  time  resolutions  in  the  sub  nanosecond 
range  have  been  measured  by  several  experiments 
[6,7]. 

The high radiation resistance of the Micromegas has 
been  verified  with  intense  x-ray  irradiation  up  to 
30mC/mm2  without  any  sign  of  aging.  The  total 
deposited charge corresponds to an equivalent fluence 
of  minimum  ionizing  particles  of  >1015/cm2  [8].

experiments in various high-flux particle beams.

The fast collection of the ions (<100 ns) suppresses 
the  space  charge  effect,  which  limits  the  gain  in  the 
common  gaseous  detectors,  and 
the 
amplification  gain  does  not  saturate  up  to  particle 
fluxes  of  109  mm-2s-1.  Due  to  secondary  effects, 
however,  a  drop  in  the  maximum  achievable  gain, 
before breakdown, has been observed. Even though, at  

therefore 

a x-ray flux 107 mm-2s-1, the gain is still high enough to 
allow full detection efficiency [9]. 

 

2.  MICROMEGAS IN PARTICLE PHYSICS 
EXPERIMENTS 

 The  COMPASS  fixed  target  experiment  at  CERN 
has pioneered the use of large 40x40 cm2 Micromegas 
detectors  for  tracking  close  to  the  beam  line  with 
particle rates of 25 kHz/mm2 [10,11,12]. All detectors 
operate smoothly with single-plane efficiencies greater 
than 97%, with a spatial resolution of 70 μm at a rate 
of 4x107/s. We should point out that no degradation of 
performance was observed in the COMPASS detectors 
after  several  years  of  operation  with  an  accumulated 
charge of a 2 mC/cm2.

consisting  of 

 The  NA48  experiment  at  CERN 

is  using 
Micromegas  detectors  for  the  charged  kaon  upstream 
stations  of 
spectrometer 
Micromegas  coupled  to  a  time  projection  chamber 
(TPC).  Tracking  of  kaons,  at  rates  exceeding  several 
107/s, is performed with a time resolution of 0.6 ns and 
a spatial resolution better than 100 μm [13]. Notice the 
beam  diameter  is  a  few  cm  and  therefore  the  particle 
flux  is  exceeding  106  cm-2s-1.  Under  these  extreme 
conditions  the  performance  of  the  detector was  stable 
over  many  years  of  operation  and  an  average 
accumulated  charge  of  2  mC/cm2.  Kaons  are  tagged 
with a momentum resolution of 0.6%, which improves 
significantly  the  resolution  on  missing  masses.  A  gap 
of 25 μm was also developed improving by a factor of 
three the speed of the detector. A thinner gap of 12 μm 
is  under  study;  it  will  provide  an  unprecedented  fast-
ion  collection  time  of  2  ns  in  Ne  and  <  1ns  in  He 
surpassing  by  an  order  of  magnitude  the  silicon  solid 
state detector. 

With the combined COMPASS and NA48 results it 
has  demonstrated 
large-scale  feasibility  and 
reliability  of  the  novel  detector  concept,  and  several 
years of running is a proof of robustness and resistance 
to high radiation levels.

     There  are  many  other  applications  of 
Micromegas  detector  especially 
detection domain. These include: 

the 
the  neutron 

in 

•  High rate neutron beam profiler in the CERN 
n-TOF [14,15] facility and neutron imaging in 
OAKRIDGE[16]. 

•  A  high-resolution  detector 
neutron tomography[17] . 

for 

thermal 

•  A  detector  with  high  time  resolution  for  fast 
neutron  detection  in  inertial  confinement 
fusion experiments providing sub-nanosecond 
time resolution [18]. 

•  A  novel  compact,  sealed  detector  called 
Piccolo-Micromegas,  has  been  designed  to 
provide  in-core  measurements  of  the  neutron 
flux  at  a  nuclear  reactor  and  to  give  an 
estimation  of  the  neutron  energy  [19].  First 
results  inside  a  TRIGA  nuclear  reactor  have 
proven  the  ability  of  the  new  detector  to 
survive in such very-aggressive environment. 
The use of four neutron converters will permit 
to  measure  on-line  the  neutron  flux  and 
energy spectrum of the reactor. 

     Despite the  great  interest of  its  excellent spatial  (< 
14 μm) and time resolution (< 1 ns) as well as the high 
rate  behaviour,  this  detector  can  operate  in  the  single 
electron counting capability [20,21]. The latter can be 
used, for instance, to track single photoelectrons in the 
photodetection  mode  or  to  reconstruct  with  high 
accuracy  low  energy  recoils  as  it  is  needed  for  x-ray 
polarization measurements [22,23]. 
     Micromegas is also in use or under development for 
low  energy  neutrino  experiments  including  neutrino 
oscillations,  neutrino  magnetic  moment,  coherent 
neutrino  scattering  and  searches  on  solar  axions  or 
dark matter WIMPs [24-28]. Reading-out large volume 
TPCs  with  highly  segmented  anode  plane  is  a  key 
point for many applications  [45-48] 
 
 

 

3.  MICROMEGAS 
HADRON BEAMS AND IMPROVEMENTS 

IN  HIGH 

INTENSITY 

     In the previous sections we have presented the high 
rate capability of Micromegas in photon beams. In the 
case of high-energy hadrons an additional effect limits 
the  rate  capability  due  to  highly  ionizing  recoils 
induced by charged particles close to the amplification 
gap  producing  accidental  discharges  [29].  Their 
probability  (10-6-10-7  per  incident  hadron)  strongly 
depends on the on the type of the incident particle and 
the nature of the gas mixture.[30]. 
     We  must  point  out 
that  discharges  are  not 
destructive but they must be reduced in order to obtain

level, allowing to sustain very-high rat 
     Recently  new  developments  are  undertaken  to 
further  improve  the  rate  capability  of  the  detector  in 
the single amplification mode. A first promising one is 
employing  a  resistive  foil  on  top  of  the  anode  plane, 
which  quenches  the  spark  formation  leading  to  a 
limited  streamer  as  shown  in  figure  1  [34].  Similar 
effect  has  been  observed  in  other  parallel  plate 
structure [35].

beyond this value (the total charge in the avalanche is 
about  108  e-  close  to  the  Rather  limit)  the  detector  is

tools  or 

detectors  have  been  built  for  the  TPC  prototype  of 
T2K  experiment.  Using  diamond 
laser 
technology  the  cloth  mesh  was  divided  in  many 
segments  without  loss  of  the  detector  performance  as 
shown  in  Figure  2.  The  high  voltage  (V=300-400 
Volts) is then distributed to the grid segments through 
individual  resistors  (R>100  kOm).  This  configuration 
divides  the  detector  into  several  sub-detectors  with 
capacitance  roughly  divided  by 
the  number  of 
segments.  Reducing  the  capacitance  of  each  segment 
down  to  small  values  (C<  10  pF)  is  crucial  for  high 
rate operation : 

•  The  total  charge  (Q=  CV)  released  during 
discharging process does not exceed 2.5x1010 
charges,  a  safe  value  for  protection  of  front-
end electronics. 

•  The  spark  process  concerns  only  a  specific 
segment,  the  entire  detector  area  is  not 
affected. 
•  The  dead 

the  specific 
time  (T=RC)  of 
segment is reasonably low of the order of T< 
100 μs owing to a negligible efficiency loss.

3.1.  The Pion Blind Detector 

     The  Hadron  Blind  Detector  has  been  proposed  by 
G.  Charpak  and  myself  in  1991[37].  The  idea  behind 
was the design of a novel threshold-Cherenkov counter 
capable  to  cope  with  substantial  particle  fluxes,  for 
instance  at  the  LHC  collider;  the  aim  was  to  resolve 
electron  tracks  inside  complex  hadronic  events,  with 
the  advantage  of being  blind  to  most  of  hadrons. The 
new  detector  was  based  on  a  windowless  concept 
enlarging  the  UV  transparency  of  the  radiator  and 
allowing to reach a large quality factor [38,39]. 
     An  HBD  prototype  using  a  low-pressure  CF4 
radiator and a 2 mm Parallel Plate Avalanche Chamber 
has been successfully tested in the SPS beam in 1992 
[40]. A good efficiency for electrons and pion rejection 
has been obtained. For the first time a quality factor of  
N0 =500 has been measured; this result is breaking the 
frontier  of 
the  conventional  Cherenkov  counter, 
limited  by  the  absorption  cut-off  of  the  UV  window 
that  reduces    the  photon  band  width.  It  was  the  first 
demonstration of the windowless HBD concept. 
A  second  important  step  forward  was  achieved  by  a 
[4].  Using  an 
SUNY-Stony  Brook-MIT  group 
improved  HBD,  excellent  efficiency  and  background 
rejection, has been measured. 
     A Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) is being developed 

for  the  PHENIX  experiment  at  RHIC.  The  HBD  will 
allow a precise measurement of electron-positron pairs 
from the decay of the light vector mesons and the low-
mass  pair  continuum  in  heavy  ion  collisions.  The 
detector  consists  of  a  50  cm  long  radiator  filled  with 
pure  CF4  and  directly  coupled  in  a  windowless 
configuration  to  a  triple  Gas  Electron  Multiplier 
(GEM)  detector  with  a  CsI  photocathode  evaporated 
on the top face of the first GEM foil [42,43]. 
     An ideal candidate for improving the HBD detector 
is 
the  use  of  reflective  CSI-UV  photocathodes 
evaporated on the MICROMEGAS mesh element [7]. 
Due  to  photon  feed  back  suppression  the  detector  is 
reaching  high  gains  and  is  detecting  single  electrons 
with high efficiency and good time resolution. The use 
light  Micromegas  structure  and  a  small 
of  the 
amplification  gap  reduces  the  ionization  produced  by 
the charge particle as well as energy loss and delta-ray 
conversions;  this  a  key  element  to  reach  an  optimal 
signal to background ratio. 
     In  this  paper  we  introduce  a  new  concept,  called 
Pion Blind Detector, which is an evolution of the HBD 
detector, to address the following challenge: 
In a new proposed experiment at CERN [441 the rare 
kaon decay K+→π+νν having very-low branching ratio 
<< 10-10 will be studied. To reach this goal an increase 
of the kaon beam intensity by two order of magnitude,

the  plane  of 

up to about 1 Ghz, is required: a real challenge for the 
first  level  trigger  and  on-line  selection  of  charged 
kaons (only 5% of the total rate). A schematic view of 
the proposed detector is shown in figure 3. It consists 
of a gas radiator, a mixture of He and CF4 to match the 
required  refractive  index  and  a  spherical  UV  mirror 
reflecting  the  Cherenkov  light  produced  by  the  beam 
particles (p60GeV/c). The reflected Cherenkov light is 
focused  at 
the  Micromegas  UV 
photodetector.  The  refractive  index  is  tuned  in  such 
way  that  the  Cherenkov  angle  is  saturated  for  pions 
and  nearly  saturated  for  kaons  as  shown  in  Figure2b. 
Under  these  conditions  in  the  Micromegas  projection 
plane  two  rings  are  detected;  a  large-saturated  one 
corresponding to pions and a smaller to kaons. Signals 
coming from the inner kaon ring will give a clear and 
unbiased trigger for an efficient kaon on-line selection. 
Such  fast  signals  (time  resolution  <  1  ns)  are  crucial 
for  this  experiment  providing  a  first  trigger  and 
efficient particle identification.

     The Micromegas offers many advantages for high-
rate high-flux environments. Large area detectors with 
excellent  radiation  resistance  are  easy  to  build  with 
low material budget. Experience has also been gained 
in  handling  discharges  initiated  by  heavy  ionizing 
recoils  induced  by  high-energy  hadrons.  Various 
schemes  either  in  the  single  amplification  or  double 
amplification  mode  are  giving  an  appropriate  solution 
to this particular problem. An attractive issue is the use 
of  a  resistive  foil  on  the  anode  plane  quenching  the 
discharge process or a segmented grid that reduces the 
discharge  strength  and  dead time  to  a  negligible  level 
opening the way to operate at even higher event rates.  
     The  novel  Pion  Blind  Cherenkov  counter  concept 
could  satisfy  most  of  the  requirements  for  very-fast 
particle identification and on-line trigger.

Abstract 

Single-crystal  nanoparticles  of  silicon,  several  tens  of  nm  in  diameter,  may  be 

suitable as building blocks for single-nanoparticle electronic devices. Previous studies of 

nanoparticles  produced  in  low-pressure  plasmas  have  demonstrated  the  synthesis 

nanocrystals of 2-10 nm diameter but larger particles were amorphous or polycrystalline. 

This work reports the use of a constricted, filamentary capacitively coupled low-pressure 

plasma to produce single-crystal silicon nanoparticles with diameters between 20-80 nm. 

Particles are highly oriented with predominant cubic shape. The particle size distribution 

is  rather  monodisperse.  Electron  microscopy  studies  confirm  that  the  nanoparticles  are 

highly oriented diamond-cubic silicon.

1. Introduction 

Silicon  nanocrystals  are  widely  considered  a  material  with  great  potential  for  a 

wide  spectrum  of  applications  and  novel  devices.  A  variety  of  novel  electronic  devices 

such as single electron transistors [1], vertical transistors [2],  and  floating gate memory 

devices  [3-6]  have  been  demonstrated.  Silicon  nanocrystals  are  also  of  interest  for 

applications 

in  solid  state 

lighting.  While  bulk  silicon  shows  basically  no 

photoluminescence  due  to  its  indirect  band-gap,  strong  photoluminescence  has  been 

demonstrated  for  silicon  nanocrystals  even  at  room  temperature  [7].  The  size-tunable 

optical and electronic properties of silicon nanoparticles, in combination with an existing 

silicon  technology  infrastructure  in  the  semiconductor  industry  and  the  element’s  low 

toxicity  compared  to  many  of  the  II-IV  and  III-V  semiconductors,  make  silicon 

nanocrystals  interesting  candidates  for  a  wide  spectrum  of  applications,  including  light 

emitting  devices  (LEDs)  [8],  quantum  dot  lasers  [7],  chemical  sensors,  and  molecular 

electronics [3, 9]. Intense research [7, 8, 10-23] is also focused on developing solid state 

light  sources  based  on  silicon  nanocrystal  that  could  in  the  long  term  replace  energy-

inefficient light sources such as incandescent light bulbs (efficiency ~ 7%) or fluorescent 

lamps (efficiency ~ 25%).   

A wide spectrum of synthesis methods is known to produce silicon nanocrystals. 

Liquid phase processes are widely established for the production of silicon quantum dots. 

These methods include anodizing silicon wavers in hydrofluoric acid solution [7, 20, 24, 

25],  synthesis  in  inverse  micelles  [26,  27],  synthesis  in  high  temperature  supercritical 

solutions  [15,  28],  the  oxidation  of  metal  silicide  [12],  and    the  reduction  of  silicon 

tetrahalides  and  other  alkylsilicon  halides  [29].  Unfortunately,  none  of  the  liquid  phase

approaches  has  so  far  resulted  in  the  highly  desirable  high-yield  production  of  silicon 

nanocrystals.  However,  solution  based  processes  offer  a  number  of  advantages  that 

include their ability to produce particles with a rather narrow size distribution.  

Gas-phase  processes  are  attractive  for  the  synthesis  of  nanoparticles  due  to high 

processing rates that can be achieved through direct gas to particle conversion. A variety 

of  gas-phase  processes  have  been  proposed  to  synthesize  silicon  nanocrystals.  These 

include nanoparticle formation through high temperature thermal reactions (pyrolysis) of 

silane  in  furnace  flow  reactors  [4,  10,  30,  31],  the  decomposition  of  silane  or  disilane 

through laser light irradiation (photolysis) [32] and the laser pyrolysis using high power 

infrared lasers [14, 17, 33-35]. Unfortunately, most gas phase processes suffer from rapid 

particle  agglomeration  due  to  the  fact  that  particles  are  usually  electrically  neutral.  For 

instance, Borsella et al. [16] report a particle size distribution with particle sizes ranging 

between 1-100 nm for their laser pyrolysis process. Agglomeration of nanoparticles is a 

severe problem, since it usually annihilates the desired nanoparticle properties.  

Nonthermal  plasmas  have  been  known  for  their  ability  to  produce  silicon 

nanoparticles for almost 20 years, however, it was mainly considered from the viewpoint 

of  a  contamination  problem  in  semiconductor  processing  and  solar  cell  production  [22, 

36-43]. Hence, the potential of using low-pressure plasmas for the high rate synthesis of 

silicon  nanocrystals  has  so  far  remained  widely  underutilized.  The  pronounced 

nonequilibrium  environment  makes  nonthermal  plasmas  attractive  for  the  synthesis  of 

particles  for  a  number  of  reasons:  1)  Nonthermal  plasmas  offer  the  same  advantage  of 

efficient  direct  gas  to  particle  conversion  as  other  aerosol  processes.  2)  Particles 

immersed  in  plasmas  are  usually  unipolarly  negatively  charged  [44-47],  based  on  the 

8ZH(cid:3).RUWVKDJHQ(cid:3)HW(cid:3)DO(cid:17)(cid:3)

much  higher  mobility  of  electrons  in  the  plasma  compared  that  of  ions.  This  unipolar 

charge  prevents  or  strongly  reduces  particle  agglomeration  [46-48].  3)  Based  on  their 

unipolar negative charge particles can be confined in the plasma synthesis reactor through 

the ambipolar electric fields [39, 49-53]. 4) Nonthermal plasma systems are widely used 

in  the  semiconductor  industry  so  that  there  is  a  large  potential  for  rapid  adoption  of 

nanoparticle synthesis processes based on plasmas.  

Several  groups  have  demonstrated 

the  synthesis  of  crystalline  silicon 

nanoparticles  with  nonthermal  plasmas.  Oda  et  al.  have  developed  a  “digital  plasma 

process” [54]. In this process crystalline particles are formed in a silane plasma produced 

in  an  Ultra  High  Frequency  discharge  and  ejected  from  the  plasma  through  injecting 

periodic pulses of hydrogen gas [9, 55]. In most of their work this group has focused on 

producing  particles  of  less  than  10-15  nm  in  size.  Crystalline  silicon  and  germanium 

particles were synthesized in a high-density helical resonator plasma by Gorla et al. [56]. 

Free-standing crystalline silicon particles of about 10 nm were also reported in the study 

of  Viera  et  al.    [57,  58].  In  these studies, nanocrystals were  produced  in pulsed  plasma 

systems using silane highly diluted in argon. The authors speculate that argon favors the 

formation of crystalline particles.  

In  this  paper  we  discuss  a  plasma  process  that  is  capable  of  producing  single 

crystal,  highly  oriented  (faceted)  and  virtually  defect-free  silicon  nanoparticles  with  a 

highly  monodisperse  size  distribution.  The  goal  of  producing  these  particles  is  to  use 

them  as  building  blocks  for  nanoparticle-based  electronic  devices  such  as  single 

nanoparticle  transistors.  In  order  to  be  compatible  with  current  lithography  capabilities 

we  aim  at  synthesizing  nanoparticles  that  are  several  tens  of  nanometers  in  size.  In

previous  studies  we  had  shown  that  low  pressure  inductive  plasmas  can  be  used  to 

synthesize  silicon  nanoparticles  with  excellent  control  over  the  particle  size  and  the 

spread  of  the  particle  size  distribution  function  [59].  In  this  study,  particles  were 

synthesized  in  an  inductive  GEC  reference  cell  with  a  planar  coil  in  pure  silane  at  a 

pressure  of  10-12  mTorr,  an  RF  power  of  200  W,  and  an  overall  plasma  volume  of 

approximately  1,200  cm-3.  (For  more  details  we  refer  the  reader  to  ref.  [59].)  Particles 

were  found  to  be  highly  monodisperse  and  nonagglomerated  and  their  size  could  be 

sensitively  controlled  via  the  plasma-on  time.  However,  the  silicon  particles  that  were 

produced  in  this  system  were  usually  amorphous  and  not  suited  for  device  applications 

due to their high intrinsic defect density [60]. 

In  an  effort  to  synthesize  nanoparticles  in  a  plasma  that  provided  a  higher  gas 

temperature  and  more  likely  yielded  crystalline  particles,  we  switched  to  a  different 

system that operated  at  significantly  higher  power  density  [61]. In  this system, particles 

were synthesized in a flow-through tube reactor using a 4.7 cm inner diameter and a 5.1 

cm outer diameter fused silica tube. The plasma was excited by a 5 turn helical coil and 

an RF power of about 150-200 W was coupled into a plasma volume of about 100 cm-3. 

The process was typically run in 0.72 sccm of silane (5%) in helium (95%) and 3 sccm of 

argon,  leading  to  a  total  pressure  of  700  mTorr.  Extensive  Transmission  Electron 

Microscope  (TEM)  analysis  of  the  particles  obtained  showed  that  this  process  indeed 

produced  single  crystal,  virtually  defect  free  particles.  Particles  were  generally  faceted 

and highly oriented. Different crystal shapes were observed including cubic particles and 

particles with a hexagonal appearance. Unfortunately, the particle size distribution found 

in  this  study  was  rather  polydisperse  and  the  great  variety  of  different  particle

morphologies  obtained  for  the  same  plasma  conditions  seemed  to  make  this  process  ill 

suited for particle synthesis  for device  applications.  For detailed  results of these studies 

the reader is referred to ref. [61]. 

In  this  paper  we  report  results of  a recent development  of  a  plasma  process  that 

yields  single  crystal  silicon  nanoparticles  with  a  mainly  well  defined  cubic  shape  and a 

rather monodisperse size distribution.  The experimental set-up is discussed in section 2, 

results are presented in section 3. An interpretation of our observations is given in section 

4, and the conclusions are summarized in section 5. 

 

2. Experimental Set-Up 

A  schematic  of  the  system  used  in  this  study  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Only  slight 

modifications have been  made compared to the system used in our previous study [61], 

however,  these  modifications  lead  to  a  significantly  different  plasma  behavior.  The 

plasma  is  produced  in  a  quartz  tube  with  5.1  cm  inner  diameter  and  23  cm  length.  RF 

power of about 200 W at 13.56 MHz is applied to a single ring-like RF electrode, which 

is positioned about 10 cm from the grounded metal flanges at the downstream end of the 

discharge  tube.  The  discharge  is  operated  using  a  dilute  mixture  of  5%  silane  in  95% 

helium and argon.  A 2.5-sccm-silane:helium (5:95) flow and 3-sccm argon flow yield a 

discharge  chamber  pressure  of  1500  mTorr.  The  plasma  is  typically  run  for  90 seconds 

with a 200W RF power input.  

The  fused  silica  discharge  tube  is  attached  to  a  high  vacuum  (HV)  chamber. 

Particles are extracted through a 1-mm orifice. The pressure in the low pressure chamber 

downstream  of  the  extraction  orifice  is  10-3  Torr.  The  pressure  difference  leads  to  the 

8ZH(cid:3).RUWVKDJHQ(cid:3)HW(cid:3)DO(cid:17)(cid:3)

(cid:3)

formation of a supersonic gas jet  downstream  of  the orifice. Particles are accelerated in 

this  jet  to  velocities  of  up  to  250  m/s  and  deposited  on  to  the  TEM  grids  by  inertial 

impaction.  Cu  support  grids  with  an  amorphous  carbon film (01822-F ultra-thin  carbon 

type–A  from  Ted  Pella  Inc.)  were  used  for  the  deposition.  The  base  pressure  of  the 

systems prior to plasma operation is 10-4 Torr in the discharge tube and 10-7 Torr in the 

Conventional  TEM  was  performed  using  a  Philips  CM30;  high-resolution 

examination  was  carried  out  in  an  FEI  Tecnai  F30.  In  both  cases  the  instrument  was  

operated at an accelerating voltage of 300kV 

HV chamber. 

 

3. Results 

Applying  RF  power  to  the  ring-electrode  leads  to  a  bright  plasma,  shown  in 

Figure  2A,  between  the  RF  ring  electrode  and  the  downstream  grounded  flange  which 

acts  as  the  ground  electrode.  The  plasma  is  seemingly  diffuse  but  exhibits  a  certain 

structure  with  a  slightly  discontinuous  luminosity  distribution.  However,  to  the  human 

eye  the  discharge  also  has  an  unstable,  “flickering”  appearance.  For  this  reason,  we 

decided  to  image  the  discharge  with  a  high-speed  intensified  charge  coupled  device 

(CCD)  camera  which  allows  framing  rates  of  up  to  40,000  frames  per  second  (Kodak 

Ektapro HS motion analyzer 4540mx ). High speed movies taken with this camera reveal 

that the discharge is not diffuse, as time-averaged images or the human eye suggest, but 

that  it  consists  of  a  filament  of  high  luminosity  plasma  globules  (Figure  2B),  which 

rotates in the discharge tube close to the tube wall with a frequency of about 150 Hz. This

(cid:3)

rotation is not completely periodic, but it is sometimes interrupted by erratic “jumps” of 

the filament or by changes of the direction of rotation.  

In order to understand where particles are formed in this discharge laser scattering 

experiments were performed. A He-Ne laser beam was directed parallel to the discharge 

axis  through  a  window  at  the  upstream  side  of  the  discharge  tube.  The  laser  beam  was 

scanned  in  radial  direction  in  steps  of  1  mm.  The  scattering  light  was  detected  at  ~90° 

scattering angle with a digital camera (Canon Powershot A70) that viewed the discharge 

tube side on. The emission of the plasma was largely suppressed by using an interference 

bandpass  filter  (Edmund  Optics  NT43-133,  peak:  632  nm,  FWHM:  10  nm,  peak 

transmission  >  45%).  The  exposure  time  for  each  image  was  2  seconds.  Individual 

images were combined in Photoshop to give a compound image of the particle scattering 

signal. Figure  3  shows the  time-average optical emission of the  discharge  together with 

the  obtained  laser  scattering  signal.  Upstream  of  the  region  of  the  constricted  plasma 

filament a diffuse plasma region is visible which is separated from the position of the ring 

electrode  by  a  darker  sheath  region.  It  is  obvious  that  the  strongest  scattering  signal  is 

observed in the region between this dark sheath and the RF ring electrode. The scattering 

is also concentrated close to the walls upstream of the ring electrode, while no scattering 

is observed from the discharge center. This result suggests that there is a region of strong 

particle  formation  or  of  particle  trapping even upstream of the  rotating filament  plasma 

region. 

Transmission  Electron  Microscope  (TEM)  analysis  was  performed  on  the 

nanoparticles  that  were  collected  in  the  high  vacuum.  Figure  4  shows  typical  particles 

extracted  from  the  plasma.  Figure  4A  demonstrates  that  the  particles  are  mainly

(cid:3)

nonagglomerated with a rather monodisperse size distribution. It can be seem that most of 

the particles are faceted with the cubic crystal shape being predominant. The faces of the 

cubes are along [100] planes.  The difference in the apparent contrast of the particles is 

due  to  small  differences  in  the  alignment  of  the  particles  with  respect  to  the  electron 

beam.  Aligned  particles  show  strong  Bragg  diffraction  and  appear  dark  [62].    The 

particles  are  single-crystal  diamond-cubic  silicon  as  verified  by  selected-area  electron 

diffraction.    Figure  4B  shows  a  higher  resolution  image  of  a  typical  nanoparticle.  The 

particle  has  an  almost  perfect  cubic  shape.  No  evidence  of  dislocations  or  other  planar 

defects was found. A 1-2nm thin amorphous layer surrounds the particle.  

Fig.  5  shows  the  particle-size  distribution  as  determined  from  image  analysis  of 

the  TEM  images.  Using  the  software  NIH  Image [63], the particle diameter is  obtained 

from  the  TEM  images  by  assuming  the  particle  area  to  be  the  projection  of  a  spherical 

particle.  The  particle  size  distribution  shown  in  Fig.  5  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  more 

than  700  particles.  It  is  well  approximated  by  a  Gaussian  distribution  with  a  peak 

diameter of 35.4 nm and a standard deviation of 4.9 nm.  

In order to verify that the filamentary constricted mode is indeed responsible for 

forming the cubic single crystal particles, we have also performed experiments in which 

we avoided the formation of the rotating filament. This can be achieved by changes of the 

discharge  matching  and  the  distance  of  the  ring  electrode  to  the  grounded  flanges. 

Unfortunately, this test is slightly ambiguous since the power coupled into the discharge 

changes  as  well.  Figure  6  shows  typical  nanoparticles  that  are  found  in  this  diffuse 

plasma  mode.  Particles  are  generally  fractal  agglomerates  (Fig.  6A).  The  individual 

primary  particles  are  of  a  size  of  ~10-20  nm  and  are  crystalline,  as  shown  in  the  high-

resolution  TEM  image  in  Figure  6B.  The  distinct  cubic  shape  of  the  nonagglomerated 

particles obtained from the filamentary constricted mode was not observed in the diffuse 

plasma mode. 

4. Discussion 

At this point, neither the formation mechanism for the filamentary discharge nor 

the particle formation mechanism is completely understood. However, the above results 

suggest several conclusions. 

Concerning  the  mechanism  that  leads  to  the  filamentary  discharge,  we  suspect 

that  the  filament  formation  is  based  on  the  thermal  constriction  instability,  whose 

mechanism  is  described  in  ref.  [64].  Based  on  this  scenario,  a  local  increase  of  the  gas 

temperature in the discharge leads to a local increase in the reduced electric field strength 

E/N  (with  E  the  applied  electric  field  and  N  the  neutral  gas  density).  The  usually 

exponential  dependence  of  the  ionization  frequency  on  E/N  leads  to  a  strong  local 

increase of the ionization which causes a rise in the plasma density. This rise in plasma 

density  leads  to  enhanced  Joule  power  dissipation  in  the  filament  and  to  a  positive 

feedback enhancement of the local gas heating. This scenario is supported by the fact that 

we  observe  the  filamentary  constriction  only  if  a  sufficiently  high  partial  pressure  of 

Argon buffer gas is used and the total gas pressure is larger than about 500 mTorr. Both 

measures,  the  use  of  a  buffer  gas  with  a  low  thermal  conductivity  and  the  use  of  high 

pressure promote local gas temperature enhancements. 

With respect to the particle formation mechanism, it is important to point out that 

Figure  3  suggests  that  initial  particle  growth  may  already  occur  in  the  diffuse  plasma 

region  upstream  of  the  ring  electrode. The region of  strong scattering  seems  to  indicate 

8ZH(cid:3).RUWVKDJHQ(cid:3)HW(cid:3)DO(cid:17)(cid:3)

3DJH(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:3)

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

either  a  region  of  strong  particle  growth  or  of  particle  trapping.  Since  the  RF  ring 

electrode is powered by RF voltages of several hundred volts, the “dark sheath” observed 

in Figure 3 could indicate the presence of an RF sheath that is established upstream of the 

ring  electrode  through  capacitive  coupling  to  the  upstream  grounded  metal  flanges.  If 

particles  are  generated  in  the  upstream  diffuse  plasma  and  if  they  acquire  a  negative 

charge  as  expected  for  particles  larger  than  a  few  nanometers  [47,  65],  it  is  likely  that 

these particles could be trapped in the time-averaged potential of the RF sheath [50, 51]. 

It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  fact  that  scattering  signal  is  observed  with  a  low 

power (~10 mW) He-Ne laser and that the scattering is easily observed with the human 

eye  suggests  that  the  particles  producing this scattering signal  in this  region  must  be  of 

the size of several tens of nanometers. This observation is significant, since for particles 

several tens  of nanometers in diameter, Brownian diffusion should become unimportant 

[66]. For instance, for spherical silicon particles 20 nm in diameter, one can estimate the 

typical  diffusion  time  under  our  experimental  conditions  to  be  about  11  seconds, 

assuming  a  typical  diffusion  length  of  1  cm.  For  larger  particles,  this  diffusion  time 

increases  rapidly.  In  comparison,  the  transit  time  of  particles  through  the  filamentary 

plasma  region  is  about  4  seconds  for  our  gas  flow  rates.  Considering  that  both  the 

scattering  signal  upstream  of  the  ring  electrode  and  the  filament  rotation  are  observed 

close to the wall, it appears likely that the particles travel through the region of filament 

rotation. The fact that particles can escape the potential trapping region while the plasma 

is  operated  was  confirmed  by  exposing  TEM  grids  to  the  particle  stream  only  during 

periods  of  plasma  operation.  Particles  were  observed  on  the  grids,  which  rules  out  any 

suggestion that particles are completely trapped during the plasma operation.

While crystalline nanoparticles were observed both in the constricted filamentary 

mode and in the uniform mode, the particular properties of the filamentary plasma appear 

to favor a complete sintering of the particles and the formation of single crystals. The fact 

that  crystalline  primary  particles  are  also  found  in  the  diffuse  plasma  is  not  surprising, 

since  cyrstallinization  of  amorphous  silicon  has  been  observed  under  the  influence  of 

atomic hydrogen even at low temperatures [55, 67]. Simple heat transfer calculations for 

the  diffuse  plasma,  which  also  apply  to  the  background  gas  of  the  filamentary  plasma, 

show that the gas temperature should not exceed the temperature of the gas entering the 

reactor by more than about 100 K. This is due to the fact that only a small fraction of the 

RF energy is expended for heating the neutral gas, as discussed below. 

In order to understand the processes in the filamentary plasma, we perform a few 

simple  estimates  of  the  plasma  properties  within  the  filament.  We  estimate  the  plasma 

properties in the filament by assuming that each of the plasma globules observed in Fig. 

3B  is  a  self-sustained  plasma  in  the  sense  that  an  ionization-diffusion  particle  balance 

needs  to  be  satisfied  for  each  of  the  globules.  For  simplicity,  we  also  assume  that  the 

plasma properties are mainly determined by the argon buffer gas. While this assumption 

may be debatable, it may be justified by the fact that at least part of the silane is already 

dissociated  and  converted  into  particles  and  film  on  the  reactor  walls  upstream  of  the 

filamentary plasma region. Furthermore, we do not expect the helium carrier gas to play a 

significant  role  due  to  its  much  higher  electronic  threshold  energies  as  compared  to 

argon. We furthermore limit our simple estimates to the case of ground state ionization of 

argon,  since  a  detailed  treatment  of  step-wise  excitation  and  ionization  is  beyond  the

the importance of the various energy absorption mechanisms. Of particular importance is 

the total Joule power absorbed per electron  

and the power lost per electron in elastic electron-neutral collisions

Results of this simple model are presented in table 1. The plasma densities shown in table 

1 are an upper estimate based on the assumption that 100% of the RF power is absorbed 

by the plasma. In a real experiment the power effectively absorbed may be significantly 

smaller. It is instructive to note that the gas temperature within the plasma globule is only 

a few tens of  Kelvin above the temperature of the surrounding gas. This estimate appears 

too low and not consistent with the assumption of a thermal constriction of the discharge. 

However,  our  estimate  does  not  include  the  heating  of  the  gas  by  interactions  with  hot 

particles. In order to estimate the importance of this process information about the density 

of  nanoparticles  in  the  plasma  would  be  required,  which  is  currently  not  available. The 

heating  of  the  gas  through  ion  acceleration  in  the  sheaths  around  the  particles  and 

subsequent  charge  exchange is likely  negligible,  since  the  sheath  dimension  scales with

the linearized Debye length [71] which is almost by two orders of magnitude smaller than 

the mean free path for charge exchange. 

Several  processes  may  lead  to  particle  temperatures  that  exceed  the  temperature  of  the 

surrounding  gas  [65].  Our simple  model suggests  that rather  high  plasma  densities may 

be achieved in the globules. Performing a simple energy balance, one finds that electron-

ion recombination at the particle surface may be a substantial heating mechanism for the 

nanoparticles.  Assuming  a  rotation  frequency  of  the  filament  of  150  Hz  and  a  globule 

diameter of 3 mm, a particle is exposed to the rotating filament for ~ 130 Ps. The heating 

time scale for a 40 nm diameter particle is about 30 Ps. A simplified steady-state energy 

balance  accounting  for  recombination  heating  as  well  as  particle  cooling  by  conduction 

and radiation reads:

  the  ion  thermal  velocity  and 

pV   the  potential  of  the  particle.    Results  for  the 

particle excess temperatures for both models are given in figure 7. While both approaches 

are highly debatable and  more  accurate models may  be  needed  in  the future, they show 

that the particle temperature for the expected plasma densities can be several hundreds of 

Kelvin higher than the surrounding gas temperature. This elevated particle temperature is 

likely responsible for the annealing of the particles to form the observed defect free single 

crystals. Gas-particle interactions may also lead to additional gas heating. 

 

At  this  point,  we  can  only  speculate  about  the  origin  for  the  cubic  shape  of  the 

nanoparticles.  To  our  knowledge,  cubic  silicon  nanocrystals  have  so  far  neither  been 

observed  in  plasma  processes  nor  in  any  other  gas  phase  process.  However,  the  cubic 

shape  has  recently  been  predicted  as  the  thermodynamic  equilibrium  shape  for  silicon 

particles  with  a hydrogen passivated  surface  [74]. We suspect that  the annealing due to 

particle heating in the constricted filamentary plasma and subsequent  slow cooling  after 

particle extraction into the low pressure chamber, allow the particles to find a shape close 

to their equilibrium shape. However, further studies of this topic are required.  

Finally it should be stressed that the cubic shape seems particularly desirable for 

using  silicon  nanoparticles  in  device  applications,  since  it  leads  to  an  automatic 

crystallographic  alignment  of the nanoparticles with respect to the substrate surface and 

(cid:3)

 

to large area, planar contact surfaces.  

5. Conclusion 

This  work  has  demonstrated  a  plasma  process  that  is  capable  of  producing  a 

relatively  monodisperse,  highly  oriented  nanoparticles  20-80  nm  with  a  predominantly 

8ZH(cid:3).RUWVKDJHQ(cid:3)HW(cid:3)DO(cid:17)(cid:3)

cubic shape. TEM studies indicate that the nanoparticles are crystalline diamond cubic Si 

and  free  of  planar  or  line  defects.  A  thin  amorphous  layer  surrounds  the  particles.  The 

predominant  cubic  shape  of  particles  is  highly  desirable  for  their  use  in  device 

applications.  

The  formation  of  a  plasma  constriction  leading  to  a  rotating  plasma  filament 

seems  to  be  essential  for  the  nanoparticle  properties.  While  highly  oriented  crystalline 

particles  are  found  in  the  filamentary  mode,  fractal  agglomerates  of  crystalline  primary 

particles are found in the diffuse plasma mode. At present, we interpret this filament as 

being  caused  by  a  thermal  constriction  instability.  Laser  scattering  studies  indicate  that 

particles  are  already  formed  upstream  of  the  plasma  constriction, but that particles  may 

be annealed in the filamentary plasma region. Simple estimates indicate that the particle 

temperature  can  exceed  the  temperature  of  the  surrounding  gas  by  several  hundreds  of 

Kelvin  in  the  filamentary  plasma  region  and  that  electron-ion  recombination  at  the 

particle  surface  is  the  main  particle  heating  mechanism.  This  enhanced  particle 

temperature appears to be essential in achieving single crystal particles.

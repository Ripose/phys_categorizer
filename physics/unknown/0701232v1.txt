This paper shows that based upon the Helmholtz decomposition theorem the field of a stationary 

magnetic monopole, assuming it exists, cannot be represented by a vector potential. Persisting to 

use  vector  potential  in  monopole  representation  violates  fundamentals  of  mathematics.  The 

importance  of  this  finding  is  that  the  vector  potential  representation  was  crucial  to  the  original 

prediction of the quantized value for a magnetic charge.  

§1.  Introduction 

 
Quantum  mechanics  does  not  require  magnetic  monopoles  to  exist.  However,  Dirac1)  

demonstrated that quantum mechanics apparently predicts that a magnetic charge, if it is 

ever  found  in  nature,  must  be  quantized  in  units  of 

 where  e  is  the  absolute 

c 2/h

e

electron  charge  value.  In  this  derivation  he  uses  a  vector  potential  to  represent  the 

magnetic  monopole  field.  Interestingly,  this  result  has  been  considered  one  of  the  most 

remarkable  predictions  of  quantum  mechanics,  which  has  yet 
to  be  verified 
experimentally.2)  Dirac3)  also  developed  a  general  dynamical  theory  of  the  magnetic 

monopole  reconfirming  and  extending  his  original  results.  Most  authors,  even  today, 

present  the  magnetic  monopole  quantization  based  on  the  first  derivation,  which  Dirac 
considered  incomplete.2),4),5)  Schwinger6)  confirmed  this  relation  using  an  alternative 

approach,  but  with  a  factor  of  2  instead  of  ½  (i.e.,

ec /

)  and  has  drawn  some 

2h

speculative  conclusions  from  it.  In  this  paper  we  investigate  the  representation  of 

magnetic  monopoles  in  classical  electromagnetics,  which  is  a  fundamental  step  in  the 

derivation of Dirac.

We  first  present  several  informal  arguments  based  on  the  concept  of  continuity  and 

differentiability regarding the Dirac vector potential. We also demonstrate that the Dirac 

vector  potential  is  actually  the  vector  potential  representing  the  field  of  a  semi-infinite 

thin solenoid or magnet. After this we rigorously prove that a magnetic monopole field in 

a static case can only be represented by a scalar potential, not a vector potential as used 
by  Dirac.1)  We  show  this  is  simply  a  direct  result  of  the  Helmholtz  decomposition 

theorem. It is seen that there is no vector potential left for Wu and Yang to develop their 
patching  method.7)  Dirac  used  Stokes’  theorem  to  justify  the  existence  of  the  arbitrary 

singular  line  in  the  vector  potential,  representing  magnetic  monopole.  We  demonstrate 

that his reasoning is not consistent with fundamentals of mathematics. We also see that 
the  general  dynamical  theory  of  the  magnetic  monopole3)  still  suffers  from  this 

inconsistency inherited from Dirac’s first paper. Of course, these arguments do not prove 

or disprove the Schwinger result, but they explain the reason for the discrepancy in the 

predicted quantized values for the magnetic monopole.  

§2.  Magnetic monopole field representation  

Suppose, at the origin, there is a point magnetic monopole of strength  mq  analogous to a 

point electric charge. Therefore in Gaussian units

Dirac1) assumes the concept of vector potential still holds and uses the vector potential in

This vector potential has a line of singularity along the negative  z -axis characterized by 

πθ =  called a Dirac string. This line is completely arbitrary and can be taken on any line 

passing through the origin. But we remember that mathematically, 

1B  should be written

Therefore 

1A  and  its  curl 

1B  are  not  defined  on  the  negative  z -axis,  although 

1B  has  a 

limit  and  a  removable  singularity  equal  to  the  expected  B  field.  We  should  also 

remember that the vector potential A , in a sense, is the integral of the magnetic field  B . 

The magnetic field  B  of a monopole is only singular at the origin, but 

1A  and 

1B  are not 

defined  at  the  origin  and  on  the  negative  z -axis.  An  acceptable  vector  potential  A  can 

have  singularity  only  at  the  origin.  Mathematically  the  vector  fields 

1B and  B  are  not 

equivalent, therefore

A simple analogy from elementary calculus illustrates this point. Let us consider the one

0=s

 although  its  limit  exists.  This  argument  invalidates  the 

discontinuous  function

 in  (8)  as  the  integral  function.  Note  the  similarity  to  the 

situation  discussed  above  for  the  magnetic  monopole.  It  is  incorrect  to  use  the  vector 

potential 

1A  in  (3)  to  represent  magnetic  field  of  monopole.  Also  one  expects  that  the

isotropic  spherical  magnetic  field  in  (2)  requires  an  isotropic  spherical  potential 

representation. However, the vector potential 

1A  in (3) does not posses this symmetry.

The  non-physical  view  concerning  the  vector  potential  A  in  classical  electromagnetic 

theory  is  the  likely  reason  for  using  (3)  to  represent  the  magnetic  monopole  field.  In 

classical electromagnetism, the vector potential has not been given any physical meaning 

and is considered to be only a mathematical device to simplify the governing equations. 

 
It  is  interesting  to  note  that  by  considering  A  a  non-physical  entity,  Wu  and  Yang7) 

avoided the singular Dirac string by constructing a pair of potentials

All  of  this  has  been  justified  by  arguing  that  the  vector  potential  is  just  a  device  for 

obtaining  B ,  and  we  need  not  insist  on  having  a  single  expression  for  A  valid 
everywhere.2),7) Our  mathematical  objection  is  the  same  as  before.  Even  by  accepting  a 

double  valued  vector  potential,  still  its  curl  is  not  defined  on  the  lines

We give a counter-example showing that  A cannot be manipulated in an arbitrary manner 

as  Wu  and  Yang  have  assumed.  The  magnetic  field  of  an  infinite  cylindrical  solenoid

However, it is seen that

1A cannot predict the Aharonov-Bohm effect, because it does not 

generate the required circulation around the solenoid. It should be noticed that the vector

We  can  add  an  arbitrary  smooth  curl  free  vector  which  is  the  manifestation  of  gauge 
freedom. From the way Dirac and his followers1),2),4),5),7) use the vector potential (3), the 

impression  is  that  (17)  should  not  be  the  governing  equation  for  magnetic  monopole 

5

vector  potential.  However,  we  will  demonstrate  that  the  Dirac  vector  potential  (3)  is 

really consistent with equation (17) but for a different physical problem. 

Before  continuing  the  discussion  of  the  magnetic  monopole  field,  it  should  be 

emphasized  that  there  is  nothing  wrong  with  having  a  line  of  singularity  to  represent  a 

consistent physical phenomenon. For example, the magnetic field  B  of the long straight 

wire  along  the  z direction  carrying  a  current  I  is  given  in  cylindrical  coordinates 

zϕρ

Both  vectors  A and  B  are  not  defined  on  the  z -axis,  which  in  this  case  corresponds 

uniquely  to  the  longitudinal  axis  of  the  wire.  Consequently,  this  vector  potential  is 

acceptable for representing the magnetic field.

As we mentioned the Dirac vector potential in (3) can be used to represent the magnetic 

field of a physical phenomenon which is consistent with the traditional magnetostatic and

means  that  the  cross  section  approaches  to  zero).  It  seems  this  representation  perhaps 

inspired the initial idea about magnetic monopoles. We demonstrate this fact in details.

But  we  should  remember  that  the  potential  vector A and  magnetic  field  B  in  (35)  and 

(36) are not defined along the line OA representing the solenoid or magnet, but the scalar 

electric potential  Eφ  and electric field  E in (37) and (38) are defined on this line except at 

the points O and A.  Therefore, it is clear that although the electric field  E  in (38) and 

magnetic field  B  in (36) might look similar, they are not mathematically equivalent. The 

appearance of different potentials is the manifestation of this fact.    

Interestingly,  it  is  seen  that  for  the  case  of  a  semi-infinite  solenoid  (magnet) 

where

monopole  field.  As  before 

)(xA

 and 

)(xB

 are  not  defined  along  the  negative  z -axis. 

This is because the magnet or solenoid is on this axis which represents the distribution of 

the source current. However, a real monopole should generate an isotropic spherical field

which is not equivalent to (40). Trying to use the results for a semi-infinite solenoid to 

represent  the  field  of  a  magnetic  monopole  obviously  is  not  correct.  The  line  of 

singularity has a physical meaning for the solenoid (magnet), but it has been created for 

monopole  due  to  using  vector  potential  (3).  Dirac  justifies  this  by  incorrectly  using  the 

Stokes  theorem  which  will  be  inspected  later  in  this  paper.  He  and  his  followers  are 

actually replacing a semi-infinite solenoid with a point monopole. It seems nobody can 

argue  that  the  mentioned  vector  potential  is  correct  for  representing  both  magnetic 

monopole  and  thin  semi-infinite  solenoid.  It  does  not  seem  correct  to  consider  a  non 
Euclidean  geometry  or  recourse  to  bundle  theory for  the  case  of  magnetic  monopole  as 
Wu and Yang have done.7), 10)  

As  we  have  suspected,  representing  a  magnetic  monopole  field  by  a  vector  potential 

might not be allowed. Must we abandon the use of the vector potential? We should recall 

that the potential vector  A  is defined as

It  should  be  mentioned  that  if  we  release  the  constraint  forcing 

)(xB

 to  zero  as

∞→r

, 

we  can  add  an  arbitrary  constant  to  the  potential φ and  an  arbitrary  regular  curl  free 

vector to A(x) . Of course this does not change anything in our conclusion. 

We  have  for  magnetostatics  something  similar  to  electrostatics  with  the  expected 

spherical symmetry. It is seen that the vector potential  A(x)  does not exist for magnetic 

monopole. Based on the Helmholtz theorem, the magnetic monopole, if it exists, must be 

similar  to  an  electric  charge.  Actually  the  relation  (53)  was  used  in  the  beginning  to 

obtain  (2)  by  indirect  analogy  with  electrostatics.  The  representation  of  the  field  B  by 

only  the  vector  potential  A(x)  violates  the  Helmholtz  decomposition  theorem.  The 

existence of a line of singularity in  A(x) is just the manifestation of that violation.   

Attempting  to  represent  a  stationary  magnetic  monopole  field  by  a  vector  potential  is 

exactly similar to representing a stationary point electric charge by a vector potential. A 

stationary electric charge field is irrotational and is represented only by a scalar potential. 

This is the direct result of the Helmholtz theorem which also requires a scalar potential 

representation for the magnetostatic field of a monopole. 

In general every vector field, such as the magnetic field, can be represented by

Otherwise the general equation is (46), not (41). 

In some presentations when there is a magnetic charge distribution

authors admit that using vector potential  A  is not correct.4) However,  A is still used for a

But  this  relation  is  not  complete  because  it  does  not  consider  the  magnetic  charge 

distribution. The magnetic charge distribution is defined by the generalized function

It is this equation that has the complete mathematical meaning and therefore enables us to 

consider the magnetic monopole correctly, as has been presented here. Apparently, these 

authors do not realize the consequences of representing the source point by a distribution 

function  and  the  applicability  of  the  Helmholtz  decomposition  theorem.  Thus,  they 

implicitly assume that one point does not cause any problem and then utilize the vector 

potential. 

It seems that adopting a more mathematical viewpoint is helpful. We notice that we have 

here an elliptic singular exterior boundary value problem. The bounded boundary can be 

considered to be the surface of a sphere that has approached to a point. This provides a 

point singularity, but the total assumed magnetic charge is constant. Distribution theory 

enables us to use the Dirac delta function for representing the source. From the theory of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13

elliptic  boundary  value  problems,  we  know  the  solution  is  analytic  in  the  domain. 

Therefore,  the  derivatives  and  integrals  have  to  be  analytic.  This  is  the  complement  of 

what  was  presented  in  the  beginning  of  this  section  as  speculations.  The  Dirac  vector 

potential clearly is not analytic along the line of singularity. Similarly, the composite Wu-
Yang solution7),10) also is not analytic throughout the domain. Interestingly, their double-

valued  vector  potential  is  not  acceptable  for  the  physical  semi-infinite  thin  solenoid, 

because  the  line  of  singularity  is  a  reality.  Based  on  the  Helmholtz  decomposition 

theorem, no vector potential exists to represent the magnetic monopole field. 

 
It is interesting to note that Dirac1) argues that by choosing a vector potential representing 

the magnetic monopole, it must have a singularity line which does not need to be even 
straight. Dirac uses this argument as a fundamental step in his more extended version.3) 
We demonstrate this argument following modern versions.4),5) 

First  we  need  to  present  Stokes’  theorem  which  transforms  contour  integrals  to  surface 
integrals and vice versa.11) 

Stokes’  theorem:  Let 

)V(x be  a  single-valued  vector  function  which  is  continuous  and 

differentiable everywhere in a surface S and on a simple closed contour  C that bounds S .

This states that the line integral of

is given on the surface S it is possible 

to obtain a smooth vector field V such that

be finite entails from (18) that  A′  is singular at πθ = . This argument holds for 

all spheres of all possible radii, so it follows that  A′  is singular along the entire negative 

z -axis. It is clear that by a suitable choice of coordinates the string may be chosen to be 

along any direction, and, in fact, need not be straight, but must be continuous. We should

to  be correct except at the origin, it is necessary that Stokes’ theorem be correct for every 

arbitrary  contour  and  surface  cap.  The  surface  cannot  be  arbitrary  because  it  must  not 

intersect the singular string line. Therefore, we can see that the familiar vector

But  using 

EA′

 to  represent  the  electric  field  everywhere  is  inconsistent  with  the 

electrostatic theory which uses only a scalar potential to represent the electric field of a 

point  electric  charge  at  rest.  We  see  that  if  a  magnetic  monopole  exists,  then 

magnetostatics  should  be  similar  to  electrostatics,  and  must  be  represented  by  scalar 

potential.  The  vector  fields  A′ and 

EA′ are  only  suitable  to  transform  integrals  from 

contour to surface and vice versa, although doing so is a redundant action.

As it was mentioned earlier the problem originates in replacing a semi-infinite solenoid 

or magnet with a point magnetic monopole. 

§3.  Quantum mechanics magnetic monopole quantization 

As we mentioned previously, the magnetic monopole representation by a potential is very 

crucial  to  the  quantum  mechanics  step,  which  we  now  briefly  discuss.  The  Dirac 
derivation1)  is  based  on  the  single  valuedness  of  the  wave  function  around  the  singular 

string. However, we have seen that this derivation is not consistent with the Helmholtz 

decomposition theorem. 

The classical Hamiltonian for a free charged particle with momentum p is 

            

H =

                                                     (73) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Schrödinger equation for a free particle is obtained from this classical Hamiltonian 
by the usual prescription2

                                                              (74)

                                                        (75) 

Letting the operators act on the wave function ψ, then the Schrödinger equation for a 

free particle is

It  is  obvious  that  this  form  of  the  Schrödinger  equation  cannot  produce  the  original 
quantization relation for magnetic monopole charges.1) 

Dirac  considered  his  derivation  in  1931,  which  we  explained  here,  incomplete  and 
developed a general dynamical theory of the magnetic monopole.3) However, in this more 

complicated derivation he retained his original results.

with some required condition. Although the addition of the tensor 

αβπG4

 may be viewed 

in  hindsight  as  an  attempt  to  satisfy  the  Helmholtz  theorem,  unfortunately  he  still 
considered the existence of the assumed arbitrary string line.1) As we already explained 

this string line is not consistent with mathematical rules such as Stokes’ theorem, as well 

as the Helmholtz theorem. In particular, the Helmholtz theorem does not allow us to be 

so free in considering a singularity line and so on.  

As  mentioned  previously,  considering  A  as  a  device  without  physical  meaning  might 

have been the reason to violate mathematical rules. However, in the quantum mechanical 

relation  (79)  potentials  φ and  A  are  considered  physical.  In  the  explanation  of  the 

Aharonov-Bohm effect9) some researchers have concluded that in quantum mechanics it 

is  A  rather than  B  that is fundamental as a physical reality. It is more surprising to note 

that the derivation of the magnetic monopole and the explanation of the Aharonov-Bohm 

effect  are  essentially  based  on  the  same  ideas  related  to  the  gauge  transformations  in 
quantum  mechanics.2,7,10) We conclude that, for the electromagnetic field of a magnetic 

monopole,  the  potentials   φ and  A  should  be  also  physical  and  certainly  must  satisfy 

mathematical rules such as the Helmholtz decomposition theorem. In our discussion we 

have  only  used  mathematical  rules  to  disqualify  the  magnetic  monopole  derivation. 

However,  finding  a  physical  reality  for  scalar  and  vector  potentials  in  classical 

electrodynamics  can  render  an  obvious  reason  for  non-physicality  of  the  singularity  or 

discontinuity on an arbitrary line in the A  field.  

From the discussion in this paper, one might speculate that magnetic monopoles do not 

exist.  The  lack  of  finding  even  one  monopole  is  perhaps  good  support  for  this 

speculation.  Why  does  nature  need to have electrostatic-like monopoles? However, this 

paper is not about disproving the existence of magnetic monopoles. This speculation will 

be discussed further in a future paper.

§4.  Conclusion 

 

It  has  been  shown  that  based  on  the  Helmholtz  decomposition  theorem,  the  stationary 

magnetic  monopole  field  can  only  be  represented  by  a  scalar  potential  similar  to 

electrostatics,  not  as  a  vector  potential.  Considering  the  vector  potential  A  as  a  non-

physical entity, we still cannot use it in representing a magnetic monopole, because of the 

violation  of  the  Helmholtz  decomposition  theorem.  Vector  potential  A  cannot  be 

manipulated as long as it generates magnetic field. Its continuity must be guaranteed. The 

smoothness  of  the  magnetic  strength  field  B  everywhere,  except  the  position  of 

monopole, must be satisfied by every integral representation of this field. It was shown 

that  the  Dirac  vector  potential  for  a  magnetic  monopole  actually  is  the  vector  potential 

representing  the  field  of  a  semi-infinite  thin  solenoid  or  magnet.  This  vector  potential 

cannot represent the field of two different physical phenomena at the same time. The line 

of singularity for the solenoid (magnet) is physical and acceptable, but it is not for a point 

monopole  having  isotropic  spherical  symmetry.  This  fact  prevents  us  to  consider  a  non 
Euclidean geometry or to use fiber bundle theory for explaining the magnetic monopole.

Abstract.  The  inertia  property  of  matter  is  discussed  in  terms  of  a  type  of  induction  law  related  to  the  extended  charged 
particle's own vector potential. Our approach is based on the Lagrangian formalism of canonical momentum writing Newton's 
second law in terms of the vector potential and a development in terms of obtaining retarded potentials, that allow an intuitive 
physical  interpretation  of  its  main  terms.  This  framework  provides  a  clear  physical  insight  on  the  physics  of  inertia.  It  is 
shown that the electron mass has a complete electromagnetic origin and the covariant equation obtained solves the "4/3 mass 
paradox". This provides a deeper insight into the significance of the main terms of the equation of motion. In particular a force 
term is obtained from the approach based on the continuity equation for momentum that represents a drag force the charged 
particle feels when in motion relatively to its own vector potential field lines. Thus, the time derivative of the particle's vector 
potential leads to the acceleration inertia reaction force and is equivalent to the Schott term responsible for the source of the 
radiation  field.  We  also  show  that  the  velocity  dependent  term  of  the  particle's  vector  potential  is  connected  with  the 
relativistic increase of mass with velocity and generates a stress force that is the source of electric field lines deformation. This 
understanding  broadens  the  possibility  to  manipulate  inertial  mass  and  potentially  suggests  some  mechanisms  for  possible 
applications to electromagnetic propulsion and the development of advanced space propulsion physics.

INTRODUCTION 

 
There have been numerous attempts to explain the origin of the inertia property of matter suggested qualitatively by 
Galileo in his writings and later quantified by Newton (Jammer, 1961), although its conceptualization still remains 
as  an  unclear  resistance  of  mass  to  changes  of  its  state  of  motion.  Since  the  works  of  Kirchhoff,  Mach,  Hertz, 
Clifford and Poincaré a set of logical objections were raised against Newton's laws mainly based on the significance 
of mass and force (Eisenbud, 1958). Driven by a strong need to develop advanced space propulsion physics there are 
studies that try to link inertia with gravitational interactions with the rest of the universe (Mach, 1989; Bridgman, 
1961;  Sciama,  1953),  while  others  hypothesize  that  inertial  forces  result  from  an  interaction  of  matter  with 
electromagnetic fluctuations of the zero point field (Sakharov, 1968; Puthoff, 1989; Haisch and Rueda, 1998) and, 
finally,  others  that  attribute  inertia  as  the  result  of  the  particle  interaction  with  its  own  field  (Lorentz,  1992; 
Abraham, 1902; Richardson, 1916; see also Ray (2004) for a general survey). 
 
Historically,  it  was  the  experimental  studies  of  electrically  charged  particles  animated  by  high  velocities  that  lead 
physicists to introduce the notion of electromagnetic inertia besides mechanical inertia. J. J. Thomson was the first 
to introduce the idea of a supplementary inertia with constant magnitude for a charge q with radius R in a medium of 
 (Thomson, 1881) 
magnetic permeability (cid:0)
(see Arzeliés (1966) for a deep historical account). Inspired probably on Stokes (1849) finding that a body moving in 
water  seems  to  acquire  a  supplementary  mass,  Thomson  built  a  hydrodynamical  model  with  tubes  of  force 
displacing the ether. However, these studies have not achieved a clear and concise explanation of the phenomenon 
although  different  approaches  to  the  classical  model  of  the electron in a  vacuum may  contribute  to  clarify  hidden

aspects of the problem (Dehmlet, 1989). Until now there is no experimental support of Mach's principle as a recent 
experimental test using nuclear-spin-polarized 9Be+ ions gives null result on spatial anisotropy and thus supporting 
local Lorentz Invariance (Prestage et al., 1985). This supports our viewpoint that inertia is a local phenomena and it 
is along this epistemological basis that we discuss the inertia property of matter in terms of an interaction of material 
particles  own  vector  potential  with  mechanical  momentum.  After  all,  quantum  electrodynamics  was  built  on  a 
similar basis (Tomonoga (1966) in his Nobel lecture describes the process on the following grounds: "The electron, 
having  a  charge,  produces  an  electromagnetic  field  around itself.  In turn,  this  field,  the  so-called  self-field  of  the 
electron, interacts with the electron [...] Because of the field reaction the apparent mass of the electron differs from 
the original mass"). However, it is clear from this account that not all electromagnetic mass has an electromagnetic 
nature in QED phenomenology. 
 
Limiting  our  considerations  to  a  pre-relativistic  treatment,  we  attempt  to  compute  the  electromagnetic  mass 
obtaining  the  equation  of  motion  of  an  'electron-like'  extended  charged  particle.  Finally  on  the  basis  of  the 
convective derivative terms we attempt to elucidate their physical meaning. It is worthy to recall here that a long-
time ago Heaviside (1893) emphatically expressed the idea that "It seems [...] not unlikely that in discussing purely 
electromagnetic speculations, one may be within a stone's throw of the explanation of gravitation all the time". 
 
 

THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ORIGIN OF INERTIA PROPERTY 

 
The inertia force has remained a mystery ever since it was described by Newton, and up until now there has been no 
straightforward clear explanation for it. Newton's first law, the law of inertia, states that a body remains at rest or in 
motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by a force. From Newton's second law of 
motion  we  know  that,  to  overcome  inertia,  the  applied  force  has  to  have  the  magnitude  of  the  inertia  force.  So, 
despite knowing that for every action (acceleration) there is a reaction (inertia) as stated by the Newton's third law, 
these two forces do not cancel each other since velocity has to change for the effect to take place due to the retarded 
fields emanating from an accelerated charge. 
 
In the  Lagrangian  formalism  of  a  charged  particle  the  generalized  (canonical) momentum  must  be  p  =  mv  +  qA. 
Whenever the particle is not subject to an external force, it is p rather than mv that is conserved. Maxwell advocated 
in  1865  that  the  vector  potential  could  be  seen  as  a  stored  momentum  per  unit  charge,  and  Thomson  in  1904 
interpreted  A  as  a  field  momentum  per  unit  charge.  More  recently,  Mead  (1997)  derived  standard  results  of 
electromagnetic  theory  of  the  direct  interaction  of  macroscopic  quantum  systems  assuming  solely  the  Einstein-de 
Broglie relations, the discrete nature of charge, the Green's function for the vector potential, and the continuity of the 
wave  function - without any reference to Maxwell's equations. Holding an opposite view are Heaviside and Hertz 
who  envisaged  in  the  vector  potential  merely  as  an  auxiliary  artifact  to  computation  (Semon  and  Taylor,  1996; 
Coïsson, 1973; Konopinski, 1978; Calkin, 1979; Gingras, 1980; Jackson and Okun, 2001; Iencinella and Matteucci, 
2004; Fowles, 1980). 
 
In this paper inertia is discussed in terms of the "potential momentum", or vector potential created by the particle, as 
the primary source for the inertia force. It is known that any charged particle in motion constitute an electric current 
with  an  associated  "potential  momentum",  A.  When  the  velocity  is  uniform,  A  is  constant  in  magnitude  and  no 
"potential  momentum"  will  be  exchanged  between  the  field  and  the  particle.  If  the  velocity  varies,  however,  the 
difference  in  "potential  momentum"  caused  by  the  resulting  acceleration  will  exert  a  force  on  the  particle  itself 
which will be opposed to the external applied force. 
 
Fig. 1 shows an accelerated positive charge with the respective star-like electric field lines E+ represented when at 
rest;  to  the  right  we  have  pointed  the  acceleration  vector,  a,  and  velocity  vector,  v;  above  we  have  the  current 
density,  J,  and  the  vector  potential,  A,  directed along  the particle's  movement.  Also,  it is represented the  induced

force  produced  by  the  reaction  of  a  body  to  an  accelerating  force.  The  attraction  and repulsion  signs refer  to  the 
forces that the particle "feels" due to the interaction between its own electric field and the induced electric field Ei. 
This electric field acts to counteract the acceleration of the charge, and exists only during the acceleration time of 
the  particle.  We  clearly  see  that 
iEF   has  the  same  direction  as  the  inertia  force  FI,  but  does  it  has  the  same 
magnitude? Examining Fig. 1 one can readily see why a particle "feels" an inertial force whenever it is submitted to 
accelerating or decelerating external forces. When in motion it generates a current I (and a related vector density of 
charge J=r v) and a potential vector A in the same direction of velocity, the retarded field is given by:

punctual  (see  Jackson  and  Okun  (2001)  for  more  details  on  the  self-reaction  force).  The retarded  quantity  has  an

This  is  still a  pre-relativistic  formulation restraining  the  validity  of  its  results  to  low  particle  velocities.  Now,  we 
decompose the total fields into the external field Aext and the self-fields As : 
 
                                                                                    A = Aext + As.                                                                            (3) 
 
The total linear momentum is conserved only when using the canonical momentum (Landau and Lifschitz, 1989), p, 
and it is given by: 
 
                                                                                     p = (cid:0) v + qA.                                                                            (4) 
 
A possible approach to the problem consists in using Newton's second law in the non-relativistic limit for a charge q 
in the presence of an external force Fext. This is a continuity fluid-like equation:

Here, D/Dt means the total (convective) derivative. Its use seems to offer a natural frame to describe the motion of 
an electromagnetic system relatively to an inertial frame. Maxwell expressed the electromotive force (Jackson and 
Okun, 2001) as E = -DA/Dt although he did not explore fully its consequences more carefully studied by others after 
him (Searle, 1896; Hertz, 1962; Rosen and Schieber, 1982; Pinheiro, 2006). The convective derivative operator in 
space is given by:

This result is important because it tells us that when a particle is acted upon by an external force and accelerates, the 
change in "potential momentum", A, acts oppositely in order to conserve linear momentum. The magnitude of the 
force  derived  by  this  change  -  the  qDA/Dt  term  -  maybe  interpreted  as  an  induced  force  of  inertia  acting  on  the 
particle. Since 
 when taking due care with of the convective derivative, remark that we can rewrite Eq.

where  the  B-field  appears  explicitly.  The  terms  with  the  self-fields  give  the  reaction  force  and  as  well  terms  of 
higher order with no clear physical interpretation (see Jackson and Okun (2001), sec.17.3). The last term in Eq. 9 is 
related to Aharonov-Bohm effect (Boyer, 1973; Aharonov and Bohm, 1959; Trammel, 1964). We can see that the 
particle’s own Coulomb field doesn't contribute to a net self-force; when subject alone to its own Coulomb field the 
extended  particle  describes  a  uniform  velocity  motion.  Now  we  can  apply  Eq.  8  to  an  extended  charged  particle 
while assuming spherical distribution of charge and slow acceleration. These assumptions probably describe well a 
charged  particle  at  small  velocities.  At  higher  velocities  the  particle  acquires  an  ellipsoidal  shape  and  our 
approximation are not anymore valid. Using Lorentz’s procedure we can conveniently write Eq. 8 under the form:

Together,  they  constitute  the  radiation  reaction  field.  Millonni  (1984)  has  shown  that  from  the  fluctuation-
dissipation theorem it must exists an intimate connection between radiation reaction and the zero-point field (ZPF), 
),
 
since the spectrum of the ZPF depends of the third derivative of the particle's position vector. Here, 
and R is the classical particle radius (Leighton and Sands, 1964). It is important to point out that a factor 1/2 has to 
be inserted above into the integrals appearing in Eq. 10 since they represent the interaction of a given element of 
charge  dq  with  all  the  other  parts,  otherwise  we  count  twice  that  reciprocal  action.  Recall  that  the  value  of  the

represents  the  instantaneous  electrostatic  potential.  The  obtained  value  is  related  to  the  assumed  structure  of  the 
"electron-like"  particle  with  the  charge  concentrated  on  the  surface  of  a  sphere  with  radius  R  (Weisskopf,  1949; 
Rohrlich,  1960),  while  if  we  assume  a  charged  spherical  particle  we  should  obtain  instead  Ues  =  2e2/3c2R.  The 
electron is  likely  to  be  hollow  since  otherwise  a  singularity  exists at the  center  of  the  sphere  which amount  to  an 
infinite energy inside; there is no electric field inside the classical radius. See a propos the clear discussion about 
this matter in Jackson and Okun (2001), Marmet (2003) and Dirac's "bubble-model" of the electron (Dirac, 1962). 
Finally, let's consider the second integral in the right-hand side of Eq. 8 given by:

The n = 3 term is of order of the second derivative

our initial assumptions. We postpone the discussion of the magnetic component of the self-force to Sect. 3. 
 
So far we can state that whenever there is a particle with mass m and charge q accelerating or decelerating it will be 
generated an  opposed  force  given  by 
iEF   which  will  act against  the  acceleration  vector.  This  mechanism  derives 
from the exchange of "potential momentum" between the particle and the field generated by its motion. We recover 
the  total  particle mass as  the  sum  of  the  mechanical mass term  (which  we  assume  as hypothetically  generated  by 
interactions  of  other nature  than  electromagnetic)  plus  the mass  of  electromagnetic  origin  (which results  from  the 
time-dependent A vector). Finally, the Newton equation of motion of an accelerated "electron-like" extended charge 
is therefore as a first approximation given by (a dot means a time derivative)

is  the  stress  force  (source  of  the  deformation  of  the  field  lines).  It  is  worth  to  point  out  that  in  Eq.  20  Lorentz 
covariance is recovered. This question has been analyzed by Hnizdo, in particular showing the contributions of the 
electromagnetic self-field to the energy and momentum of a charge and/or current carrying body and the important 
role of hidden mechanical momentum (Hnizdo, 1997). Moreover, it results from the previous developments that the 
electromagnetic mass mem equals the electrostatic mass mes = e2/2Rc2 instead of equaling 4/3 the electrostatic mass, 
as in the Lorentz-Abraham force and power equations (Arzeliés, 1966; Yaghjian, 1992; Poincaré, 1989). This result 
supports the claim that all the electron mass as well as its inertia has an entirely electromagnetic origin, as it is well-
known,  a  viewpoint  defended  by  Lorentz  (1992)  and  Schott  (1912).  The  investigations  of  Fermi  (1923)  using  a 
variational  method  also  have  shown  the  entire  electromagnetic  origin  of  the  electron  inertial  mass.  The 
electromagnetic  interaction  energy  can  explain  why  under  the  effect  of  an  external  force  acting  on  the  charged 
particle  behave  as  if  it  possessed  a  mass  mes.  In  fact,  the  discrepancies  found  in  literature  are  due  to  faulty 
electromagnetic momentum- and energy-density expressions (Möller, 1949; Butler, 1969; Wilson, 1936). 
 
Within this framework there is no contribution of other kind of interactions to inertia except purely electromagnetic 
interactions.  In  accordance,  the  mechanical  mass  must  be  null,  (cid:0)
  =  0.  This  result  brings  some  convenience  since 
whenever we calculate the electron mass with the classical electron radius (which is, however, an adjustable value 
dependent on the model, see, for example, Becker (1964), the expression obtained for the electrostatic mass gives 
exactly the experimental value of the electron mass at rest. 
 
Now returning to Eq. 10 it is clear that the inertial force is composed basically of two components: i) the local time 
derivative  of  the  vector  potential  and,  ii)  the  convective  term  on  A.  The  term related  to  a  local  change  (the  time 
derivative)  of  A,  as  we  will  see,  represents  a  resistance  to  change  induced  by  the  charge  acceleration  due  to  the 

action of its immersed own field (the reader is referred to Campos and Jimenez (1989) for a similar interpretation). 
In  fact,  the  effect  of  the  self-field  on  the  charged  particle  can  be  well  understood.  When  an  electron  suddenly 
decelerates,  the  magnetic  field  increases.  According  to  the  induction  law,  however,  an  increasing  magnetic  field 
gives  rise  to  an  electric  field.  And  this  same  electric  field  will  act  on  the  electron,  accelerating  it.  This  effect  is 
interpreted  as  a  contribution  to  inertia.  Moreover,  the  serial  developments  effectuated  above  suggest  that  the 
electrokinetic force is  by itself the source of the inertial mass and of the radiation reaction force (or Schott term). 
The radiation reaction force contributes to inertia through transfers of energy back and forth between the field and 
the  source  (due  to  the  action  of  the  source  at  the  retarded  time  on  itself,  see  also  Yaghjian  (1992)).  But  the 
electrokinetic force term, which represents a local time derivative of As, means that the mass is a locally determined 
quantity, weakening Mach's conjecture. As long as the electrokinetic term is the mass generator we can regard Ei as 
the source of the kinetic energy of the particle. It is possible that this local reaction force acting on the charge could 
be in fact, according to Newton's third law, a reaction from the physical vacuum, since the experimental findings by 
Graham  and  Lahoz  (1980)  implies  that  the  vacuum  is  the  seat  of  "something  in  motion",  like  Maxwell  himself 
envisaged  the  "aether".  And it  was  shown  that  a medium  in  uniform motion  with  velocity  v  plays  the  role  of  the 
vector  potential  while  the  charge  is  proportional  to  Fresnel's  dragging  coefficient  for  light  in  moving  media 
(Leonhardt and Piwnicki, 1999). 
 
The last term of Eq. 10 represents the convective term on A and it is non-null when the vector potential, the field 
source, is inhomogeneous. It measures the acceleration of the extended charged particle relatively to its own vector 
potential field lines located ahead of the charged particle line of motion. The physicality  of the vector potential is 
now  well  proven  experimentally  (Tonomura,  2005).  Dirac  understood  that  there  are  nowadays  good  reasons  to 
postulate  the  existence  of  an  aether  needing  an  "elaborate  mathematics  for  its  description"  (Dirac,  1962)  and  he 
attempted  to  build  a  new  classical  theory  of  electrons  not  based  on  gauge  transformations.  According  to  Dirac 
(1951) the velocity v appearing in the vector potential has the physical significance of the velocity  with which an 
electron  charge  must  flow  in  the  ether.  It  is  remarkable  how  progressively  mathematical  sophistication  is  being 
introduced  to  build  a  differential  structure  of  space-time,  beginning  with  Maxwell  when  he  identified  the  vector 
potential  with  Faraday's  intuitive  idea  of  an  electro-tonic  state  which now  developed  into  a  precise  mathematical 
concept of the connection on a fiber bundle. 
 
For the purpose to clarify further the role of the stress force let's consider a moving electron along the x-axis. The 
component of this force term is opposed to the direction of the acceleration acting effectively as a radiation reaction 
force (Rohrlich, 2000). In this case it is easily obtained the component of this stress force:

This  finding  is  consistent  with  the  physical  reinterpretation  advanced  by  Harpaz  and  Soker  (1998;  2003)  which 
explains the emitted radiation by an accelerated charge as due to the relative acceleration between the electric charge 
and  its  own  electric  field  lines  that  do  not  move  with  the  charge,  instead  of  the  usual  argument  of  the  emitted 
radiation as due to a relative acceleration between the charge and an observer. Therefore, it is this stress force that is 
the cause for resistance to acceleration. But, contrary to Harpaz and Soker approach, we obtain this drag force in a 
consistent  manner  through  the  continuity  equation  for  canonical  momentum  applied  to  an  extended  charge.  Our 
result is consistent with the mechanism of change in the inertial mass of a system of point charges interpreted by

Boyer (1973; 1978; 1979) as being due to the electromagnetic fields change during the acceleration, in such a way 
that each charge causes a new electromagnetic force on the other. 
 
The convective derivative introduced in the continuity equation for momentum flux (see Eq. 10) traduces not only 
the  conversion  from  potential  to  kinetic  energy  (term  I1),  but  also  the  convection  of  potential  electromagnetic 
momentum (term I2), the true flux of electromagnetic momentum through the medium, which is in fact related to a 
deformation of the vector potential in space. So to use an analogy between optics in fluids and the gravitational field 
(Leonhardt and Piwnicki, 1999), we sustain that the charged particle inside the flux of the vector potential acts as 
submitted to inertial forces. 
 
 

INERTIA MANIPULATION 

 
In  the  previous  developments  we  supposed  the  particle  velocity  small  and  assumed  spherical  symmetry.  But 
considering  more  complex  particle  structures  could  lead  us  to  other  substantial  findings.  For  example,  Bohm and 
Weinstein (1948) hypothesized the oscillations of the particle's own charge distribution and showed that when these 
oscillation  were  quantized  the  energy  of  the  first  excited  state  is  of  the  order  of  the  meson  self-energy.  Pekeris 
(1975)  built  a  hydrodynamical  model  of  the  electron  where  instead  of  Poincaré  stresses  (Poincaré,  1989)  the 
repulsive  forces  between  charges  were  held  by  a  dynamic  pressure  generated  by  a  steady  circulation  of  a 
nonconducting perfect fluid. Therefore, the concept of electromagnetic mass has far-reaching aspiration laying the 
foundations for the theory of elementary particles. 
 
Indeed,  other  proposals  to  control  inertia  through  appropriate  external  fields  have  been  advanced,  although  on 
different  grounds  than  ours.  For  instance,  Woodward  (1990;  1991)  demonstrated  theoretically  that  by  energy 
flowing  to  a  charged  capacitor,  Sciama's  (1953;  1964)  inertia  term  acquires  quite  large  transient  contributions, 
proportional  to  1/G  (G  denotes  the  gravitational  constant).  Also,  it  can  be  shown  that  the  equations  of  classical 
electrodynamics for an electric dipole through the self-retarded field interactions allow a self-sustained motion, even 
in  the  absence  of  external  fields  (Cornish,  1986;  Griffiths,  1986;  Petkov,  1998).  Moreover,  it  was  shown  that  a 
system  consisting  of  two  point  charges,  under  the  action  of  a  weak  gravitational  field  has  an  increase  of  weight 
(Boyer, 1973; 1978).

As the foregoing discussion of the last Section was limited to small velocities (v << c), it did not contemplate the 
magnetic field term in Eq. 9 which allows an interesting physical interpretation, as we will see now. According to 
the arguments presented by Marmet (2003) and anticipated by  Heaviside (1889) the Biot-Savart law is valid for a 
charge  current  but  when  considering an individual  charged  particle  moving  with  velocity  v  its  self-magnetic  field 
can  be  supposed  to  be  isotropically  distributed  around  the  particle,  as  it  happens  to  the  electric  field  around  the 
particle at rest. Along this line of reasoning we assume that the magnetic field has an absolute value given by:

The  above  equation  shows  that  the  mass  increase  due  to  the  self-magnetic  field  is  of  second  order  in  v2/c2  and 
supports the view that the relativistic increase of mass with velocity is due to the associated magnetic field resulting 
from  the  action  of  the  particle's  self-field  (Marmet,  2003;  Breitenberger,  1968),  although  its  effects  are  only 
noticeable at high velocities. 
 
The difference between these two referred reaction forces (the second and third terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 
10) can be better understood through the electric field lines of a charge when at rest, with a uniform velocity or with 
acceleration,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  2  and  drawn  according  to  the  equations  obtained  by  Singal  (1997).  At  rest  the 
electric field lines are spherically symmetric around the center of the particle. With a constant velocity, the electric 
field lines tend to the plane perpendicular to the velocity vector, in a symmetric fashion, while when in acceleration 
the electric field lines deform to the opposite direction of the acceleration vector, as shown in Fig. 2.c). From Eq. 26 
we obtain:

  for  a  particle  at rest.  After  multiplying Eq.  18  by  the  charge  density  and next  integrating in 
since 
space we thus find Eq. 28. Notice that vBS represents an induced electric field by the particle on itself augmenting 
the electric field perpendicular to the velocity vector. This effect can explain the "compression" of the electric field 
lines  with  velocity  and  as  well  the  relativistic  increase  of  mass.  This  makes  us  see  a  "polarization"  effect  on  the 
charge  and  its  internal  structure,  since  with  increased  velocity  the  electric  field  lines  tend  to  be  oriented 
progressively  into  a  flat  disc  perpendicular  to  the  particle  trajectory.  Eq.  28  shows  that  the  induced  electric  field 
depends on velocity, being equal in magnitude to the rest electric field of the particle whenever v = c. Thus Eq. 18 is 
not null when the velocity is different from zero, as can be seen by the strong field asymmetry shown in Fig. 2.b) 
which happens at relativistic velocities.

FIGURE 3. Electric Field Deformation of a Charged Particle Subject to Different Forces. 

 
It  is  possible  that  the  compression  of  the  electric  field  lines  by  this  effect  of  internal  polarization  may  possibly 
reduce the electron radius by decreasing the volume occupied by its electrostatic energy, and thereby increasing its 
mass  (Miller,  2003).  This  could  explain  the  relativistic  increase  of  mass  and  as  well  as  the  impossibility  of 
surpassing the light velocity in these conditions, since ultimately a black hole would be created (Burinski, 2005). 
 
For an accelerating charge, we have seen that it is generated an induced electric field given by the time variation of 
the potential vector. Since inertia is given by the forces produced on the particle by the vector potential self-induced 

field, these can be nulled out if a charge is manipulated with an unbalanced convective derivative of the potential 
vector. It will not feel an inertia reaction force but only a directed acceleration field. Our treatment of the problem 
makes it possible to  find a way to control inertia by an appropriate interplay  between the external and self-vector 
potential. Manipulating the particle directly  with an external change of the potential vector that exactly  cancels or 
surpasses the convective derivative of its own potential vector, then the particle will be manipulated without inertia. 
For  example,  Pierce  (1955)  has  shown  that  when  a  charge  moves  along  a  nondispersive  transmission  line  its 
electromagnetic mass at velocities greater than the wave velocity is negative. Also, when studying the system of two 
charged  point  particles  traveling  side  by  side,  Boyer  (1978;  1979)  proved  that  during  acceleration  the 
electromagnetic  fields  change  in  order  that  each  particle  will  act  with  a  new  electromagnetic  force  on  the  other, 
exactly balancing the external force accelerating the system and which represent a change in the inertial mass of the 
system. Proposals to manipulate the electromagnetic quantum vacuum and/or its interaction with matter in order to 
modify inertial and gravitational forces have been advanced (Haisch, Rueda and Puthoff, 1994; Haisch and Rueda, 
2000; 2001; Puthoff, 1989; 2002). 
 
Fig.  3  illustrates  the  action  of  external  forces  of  several  kinds  producing  an  asymmetry  in  their  electric  field 
distribution in order that the sink of the flux lines are oriented to the acceleration vector. We wish to point out that, 
although  the  deformation  of  the  electric  field  lines  due  to  the  inertia  force  are  represented  in  Fig.  3.d),  the 
effective/observable lines of force are as shown in Fig. 3.b) since the external force applied is superior to the inertia 
force and provides the work to deflect the lines of force. 
 
In neutral particles the electric fields of each charge continue to exist and thus each particle will be subject to inertia 
forces  by  the  self  induced  local  electric  field  appearing  due  to  the  acceleration,  although  the  net  macroscopic 
induced  electric  field  will  be  zero.  The  magnetic  fields  produced  by  neutral  matter  in  motion  cancel  out 
macroscopically  but  always  contain all  the  magnetic  energy  generated  (Marmet,  2003). Therefore,  the  relativistic 
mass increase is not easily prone to control, since any external magnetic field that we could apply  on a particle to 
cancel its own self generated magnetic field would only sum-up. 
 
Probably  the  best  way  to  control  inertia  is  engineering  the  vacuum  (Lee,  1988),  through  the  manipulation  of  the 
basic  constants  of  nature:  the  magnetic  permeability  (cid:0) 0  and  electric  permittivity  e 0.  In  order  for  the  particle  to 
generate a zero magnetic field it is sufficient to make (cid:0) 0 = 0. As we have shown, the mass of the particle depends on 
the electrostatic energy  of its field and on the velocity  of light in the surrounding space (through the mass-energy 
relationship). If we succeed by operational means to make c (cid:1)
 we would have zero mass for the particle and thus 
no  inertia.  The  vacuum  modification  effect  on  the  speed  of  light  by  the  Casimir  effect,  now  known  as  the 
Scharnhorst  effect  (Davies,  2004)  is  a  serious  candidate  to  accomplish this  goal  by  means  of  a  modified  vacuum 
energy  density.  The  manipulation  of  vacuum  is  of  vital  importance  both  in  surpassing  inertia  and  producing 
propulsion,  since  space  gradients  of  different  refractive  indexes  act  as  attractive  or  repulsive  gravitational  fields 
(Puthoff, 2002). Further research is necessary to know exactly how to manipulate e 0 and m 0 in order to change the 
local velocity  of light and vacuum energy density. The theory developed here, however, provides a framework on 
how this manipulation can affect inertia since a link was shown to electric and magnetic fields and these depend on 
the local speed of light.

CONCLUSION 

 
In  the  frame  of  a  simple  and  intuitive  approach,  using  Newton's  second  law,  we  obtain  in  a  covariant  form  the 
dynamical  equation  of  motion  of  an  extended  charged  particle,  subject  to  the  Lorentz's  procedure  with  retarded 
fields. It is shown that the electron mass has a complete electromagnetic origin. This explanation of inertia in terms 
of  the  vector  potential  turns  out  to  give  a  more  appropriate  framework  to  understand  phenomena  related  to  the 
classical electromagnetic mass theory. Our research provides significant insight over the origin of inertia as due to 
the  time  and  space  changes  (acceleration  and  velocity  dependent  term,  respectively)  of  the  particles  own  vector 
potential and we link these components with the Schott term and a stress force exerted by the charge on the lines of 
force. We offer possible means of inertia control, with important applications for electromagnetic and future space 

propulsion.  In  addition,  we  believe  this  work  contributes  one  step  further  in  the  desired  unification  of 
electromagnetic and gravitational forces.

Abstract 

The  article  provides  the  formula  for  the  calculation  the  falling  time  of 

inverted  pendulum.  The  result  is  expressed  in  terms  of  elliptic  integrals  of 

first kind. The asymptotic formula for small initial inclination value is also 

provided. 

1 Introduction 

The problem of a pendulum is one of the oldest problem of classical mechanics and can 

be  found  in  various  textbooks  (1

H[5]  pp  26,  2

H[9]  pp  162-167,  3

H[9]  pp  87-90).  The  main 

question of the problem is the period of free oscillations and the answer is given by

where  K  is  complete  elliptic  integral  of  first  kind  (see  Apendix).  In  the  opposite  to  a 

pendulum  in  the  problem  of  an  inverted  pendulum  one  of  the  questions  is  the  falling 

time0F

1.  The purpose of the article is to answer this question. 

                                                 
1 This article does not enter into the questions connected with an inverted pendulum with horizontally or 
vertically moving point of suspension (upward-driven pendulum) which is one the famous stability and 
controlling problem ([2], [3])

2 Solution 

Consider  an  inverted  plane  pendulum  in  the  homogeneous  gravitational  field  with 

acceleration g. The length of the pendulum is L, its mass is m and its moment of inertia 

is 

2
J mL=

.  The orientation (and hence the position) of the pendulum is determined by 

the inclination angle θ (Figure 1). 

Figure 1. Pendulum variables 

 

The  dynamical  equations  of  motion  of  the  pendulum  are  reduced  to  the  angular 

momentum equation 

where  ω is the angular velocity defined by

Comparing  1

required transformations will be done directly to the integral 1

Knowing

H(7). For 

example let 

L =

0.15 m

, 

g =

9.8 m s

 and 

0ω = . Then one have 

(cid:17)

0.0875

 so the

falling time for initial inclination of for example 

θ π=

For 

0θ =   the falling time is infinite T = ∞  i.e. the pendulum is in instable equilibrium 

0

position. Maybe it is interesting to calculate the falling time when initial values are set 

according  to  quantum  mechanics  uncertainty  principle.  This  principle  state  that 

x pΔ Δ ≥ (cid:61)

 where  xΔ  is position,  pΔ  linear momentum and 

(cid:61)

=

1.05457 10

×

−

34

Js

 is 

the  Planck  constant  divided  by  2π(4

H[7]  pp  1002).  In  the  case  of  inverted  pendulum 

which  is  in  the  initial  vertical  position  one  have 

Δ =

x L θ
0

sin

  and 

Δ =

p mLω
0

  so 

uncertainty principle transform to  

Taking the case 

1k =  one obtain from 4

H(9) and 4

H(13)  

(24) 

(25) 

Substituting this into 4

H(24) and taking into account that inclination angle is very small i.e. 

1θ (cid:19)  yield 

0

Now, by 4

H(20) the falling time is in this case

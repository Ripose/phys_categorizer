Abstract 

AgReO4 microcalorimeters are planned to be used again in the next generation of calorimetric neutrino mass experiments with 
sensitivity  down  to  0.2  eV.  The  understanding  and  characterization  of  all  possible  sources  of  systematic  uncertainties  is 
crucial.  In  this  work  we  focus  on  two  of  these  sources,  which  have  been  studied  in  the  10 detectors of the Milano AgReO4 
array  experiment  (MIBETA):  a)  the  solid-state  Beta  Environmental  Fine  Structure  (BEFS)  observed  for  the  first  time  in 
AgReO4; b) the detector energy response for internal beta events, which has been investigated with a dedicated measurement 
using  a  44Ti  gamma  source.  The  possible  effects on neutrino mass experiments due to the incomplete understanding of these 
two aspects are discussed.  © 2001 Elsevier Science. All rights reserved

1. Introduction 

The  discovery  of  neutrino  flavour  oscillations  is 
probably  the  most  convincing  piece  of  evidence  for 
physics beyond the Standard Model [1]. Besides the

intrinsic importance, those observations also boosted 
the interest for a direct measure of the neutrino mass.  
The  classical,  kinematical  method  making  use  of 
the  distortions  in  the  electronic  beta  spectrum  still 
seems the best way to approach the problem. So far, 
the best upper limit is 2.2eV/c2 [2] obtained with an 
electrostatic  spectrometer.  Major  systematic  effects

affecting spectrometer experiments are related to the 
separation  between  the  source  and  the  detector.  An 
alternative  approach  has  then  to  ensure  at  least  that 
source  (cid:0)
  detector.  An  elegant  way  out  is  to  make 
them  both  to coincide with the absorber of an ultra-
cryogenic (T<100mK) bolometer [3]. Every decaying 
nucleus  determines  here  a  transient,  measurable  (cid:1) T. 
The  most  stringent  upper  limit  determined  with  this 
technique relies on the lowest-Q beta decay [4]:

In particular, in [4] the source/detector is made up by 
ten  AgReO4  micro-crystals  (m  =  200÷300µg).  More 
ambitious  bolometric  experiments  have  been 
proposed to explore the eV and sub-eV mn  range [5]. 
In  the  present  paper  we  describe  two  potential 
systematic  effects  that  could  affect  a  high  statistics 
AgReO4 bolometric measure:  
•    BEFS  (Beta  Environmental  Fine  Structure)  solid-
state effects affecting the spectrum shape; 
•   detector internal (bulk) response. 

2. Beta Environmental Fine Structure (BEFS) 

In  1991  Koonin  [6]  suggested,  in  analogy  with 
EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure), 
that  the  b
  electron  should  have  suffered  reflections 
from  the  surrounding  atoms.  More  precisely,  the 
surrounding  atoms  influence  the  decay  rate  in  an 
energy-dependent (oscillatory) way. In [7] the BEFS 
theory  has  been  extended  to  include  forbidden  beta 
decays  like  187Re.  The  first  BEFS  experimental 
evidence  has  been  achieved  with  a  bolometric 
measurement and metallic rhenium absorbers [8]. We 
present  in  fig.  1  the  measured  BEFS  effect  in 
AgReO4  [9]  together  with  a  suitable  model  fit 
extrapolated  until  the  end-point.  The  lattice  zero-
point  energy  and  the  diminished  scattering  cross-
section both determine a damping of the oscillations 
superimposed  to  the “free atom” beta spectrum. For 
Ee-  >  2keV  the  extrapolated  BEFS  signal  is  an 
oscillation  of  about  2(cid:215) 10-4  amplitude  with  features 
FWHM  of  the  order  of  40eV. The “quasi-period” is 
determined  by  the  distance  of  the  Re  and  Ag  first 
atomic shells (4Å and 3.8 Å respectively).

Considering  the  proposed  experiment  MARE 
(Microcalorimeter Arrays for a Rhenium Experiment) 
[5]  phase  I  (TEND  (cid:3)
  2010),  the  integrated  number  of 
beta  decays  is  around  1010  to  get  mn   <  2eV.  A 
Montecarlo code has been adopted to confirm that the 
BEFS  effect,  even  if  ignored,  is  not  influencing  the 
neutrino mass sensitivity as far as the fit is performed 
at energies exceeding 1 keV.

Insert: end-point region (E > 2keV) extrapolation ( (cid:4) EFWHM=23eV). 

 
In the MARE phase II (1014 events, mn   sensitivity 
~0.2eV  90%  C.L.,  TEND  ‡
  2015),  on the other hand, 
the  BEFS  “noise”  in  the  end-point  region  will  be 
comparable to the poissonian fluctuations. However, 
the introduction of a corrective mask on the expected 
spectrum shape seems quite safe taking into account 
that the effect won’t be largely predominant over the 
natural statistical uncertainties. 

It  is  important  to  point  out  that  in  case  of 
compact/dense  absorbers  (e.g.  metallic rhenium) the 
BEFS  effect  amplitude  could  be  increased  by  more 
than  one  order  of  magnitude.  AgReO4,  despite  the 
lower  active  nuclei fraction, seems a relatively safer 
absorber for sub-eV experiments as far as solid-state 
effects are considered. 

3. Uniform internal calibration 

In  order  to  provide  a  realistic  estimate  of  the 
neutrino  mass  (or  its  upper  limit),  the  detector 
intrinsic  response  must  be  precisely  determined  and 
understood. An external 55Fe X-ray calibration source 
has been adopted so far to deposit a fixed amount of 
energy  within  the  absorber.  The  typical  range  of  a

dependent upon the local structure of AgReO4. Refer 
to fig. 1 for a theoretical prediction in case of detector 
energy resolution (cid:1) EFWHM = 23eV. 

4. Conclusions 

This study demonstrates that the solid-state BEFS 
effect  should  not  significantly  affect  future  neutrino 
mass determinations based on AgReO4 calorimeters. 
For  dense/compact  absorbers  the  BEFS  oscillations 
could, on the other hand, be a limiting factor. 

The  internal  detector  response  cannot  be  easily 
determined by adopting an external x-ray source due 
to the insufficient penetration in the crystal bulk. The 
preliminary results of a test run adopting an external 
44Ti  g   source  have  been  presented.  They  seem  to 
indicate  that  the  “bulk”  response is more symmetric 
and tail-free. The main limitation of this approach, in 
case  of  optimized  detectors  ((cid:1) EFWHM  ~  5eV),  is  the 
large natural width of the Re escape lines. 

An  alternative  internal  calibration,  suitable  for 
low-energy (E < 2keV), could make use of the BEFS 
modulation peaks that are going to be fully resolved 
and modeled.  

6keV x-ray photon in AgReO4 crystals is about 4µm, 
to be compared with the typical absorbers dimensions 
(» 300µm).  The  energy  is  thus  deposited  on  the 
exposed  crystal  surface  with  possible  border  effects 
(e.g. electron escape). An exponential low-energy tail 
has 
fact  been  observed  on  high-statistics 
calibration lines. A defective understanding of the tail 
nature  would  introduce  an  unacceptable  systematic 
error even for MARE phase I [5].

3.1. 44Ti and Re escape peaks 

A  44Ti  radioactive  source  produces  penetrating 
78.4keV  g -ray  photons  able  to  determine  K  and  L 
emissions  from  Re  atoms  distributed  all  over  the 
micro-crystal.  The  escape  peaks  have  energies  of 
9.05keV  (Kb 1),  9.34keV  (Kb 3),  17.22keV  (Ka 2)  and 
18.64keV  (Ka 1).  The  large  intrinsic  width  (42.1eV) 
represents the main limitation of this approach.

A  complete  analysis  is  in  progress.  Preliminary 
results  (fig.  2)  seem  to  confirm  that  the  low-energy 
tail  evident  on  surface  events  is  less  pronounced  or 
lacking on Ka  escape peaks.

3.2. BEFS as an internal calibration tool 

The  BEFS  peaks  positions  are 

fixed  and 
determined  uniquely  by  the  AgReO4  local  structure. 
They could represent a powerful self-calibrating tool 
for energies E < 2keV, where the statistics will allow 
a precise fitting and a safe modeling. 

The  FWHM  width  of  the  BEFS  features  is 
increasing with the electron energy (<10eV @400eV; 
» 40eV  @2keV).  The  peaks  shapes  are  peculiar  and

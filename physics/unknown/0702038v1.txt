    A  new  concept  of  a  free-space,  high-speed  (Gbps)  optical  communication  system  based  on  spectral 

encoding of radiation from a broadband pulsed laser is developed. It is shown that, in combination with the 

use of partially coherent laser beams and a relatively slow photosensor, scintillations can be suppressed by 

orders of magnitude for distances of more than 10 km. We also consider the spectral encoding of radiation 

from a LED as a gigabit rate solution of the “last mile” problem and rapid–deployment systems for disaster

1. Introduction 

 

Free-space optical communication (FSOC) has data rate limitations due to atmospheric turbulence. 

Laser  beams  experience  three  major  effects  under  the  influence  of  turbulence.  First,  the  beam 

phase  front  is  distorted  by  fluctuations  in  the  refractive  index,  causing  intensity  fluctuations  or 

scintillations.  Second,  eddies  whose  size  is  greater  than  the  beam  diameter  randomly  deflect  the 

laser  beam  as  a  whole;  this  phenomenon  is  called  beam  wandering.  Third,  propagation  through 

turbulent  atmosphere  causes  the  laser  beam  to  spread  more  than  predicted  by  diffraction  theory. 

Scintillations are the most severe problem and result in a significant increase of the bit error rate 

(BER) and consequent degradation of the laser communication system performance. For example, 
a gigabit data rate communication channel can operate with BER of 10-9 over a distance not more 
than  2.5  km,  even  for  clear  weather.1,2  Several  approaches  have  been  developed  to  mitigate  the 

effects of turbulence on laser communication. They include: aperture averaging, partially coherent 
beams,  adaptive  optics,  and  array  receivers.  (See  the  detailed  reviews  in1,3.)  Nevertheless, 

scintillations continue to limit the performance of FSOC.  New approaches are needed to overcome 

this  limitation.  Recently  a  new  technique  of  scintillation  reduction  based  on  the  utilization  of 

partially  coherent  beams  (beams  with  multiple  coherent  spots  in  their  transverse  section)  was 
demonstrated.4-6 Combining partially coherent beams with a time-averaging photodetector leads to 

a  significant  scintillation  reduction  with  the  corresponding  improvement  of  the  BER  by  several 
orders of magnitude.6 Unfortunately, the time-averaging method cannot be applied to gigabit rate 

communication.  The  main  limitation  of  this  method  is  related  to  the  requirement  that  the 

correlation time between different spatially coherent spots be shorter than the response time of the 

photodetector.  This  means  that  the  spatial  light  modulator  (SLM)  must  have  an  operating 

frequency ν higher than the bandwidth of the photodetector, corresponding to its inverse response 

time 

1Tν

−(cid:21) .  Since  the  photodetector  bandwidth  must  be  higher  than  the  data  rate  of  the 

communication  channel 

COMν , 

T

1
ν− (cid:21)

COM

,  the  highest  data  rate  is  limited  by  the  highest 

frequency of  SLM 

ν ν(cid:21)

.    To date,  the highest  frequency SLMs based on multiple  quantum 

COM

wells (MQW) can only operate at frequencies up to tens of MHz.7  

In the present paper we propose to extend the technique of scintillation suppression, based on time 

averaging  of  a  partially  coherent  beam  (TAPCB),  to  gigabit  rate  FSOC.  Our  idea  is  to  combine 

 

 

2

TAPCB  with  a  spectral  encoding  technique.  Originally  spectral  encoding  was  applied  to  fiber 
optics communication for code-division-multiple-access.8 In this method, information is encoded 

in  the  form  of  amplitude  modulation  of  the  spectral  components  of  the  laser  pulse  which  has  a 

broad spectrum. For long-distance communication, the broad-spectrum light source could be a Ti: 

sapphire  laser.  For  short-distance  communication  it  could  be  an  LED  as  well.  Each  pulse  or 

sequence  of  pulses  (depending  on  the  averaging  response  time  of  the  photosensor)  can  contain 

kilobits of data. If the pulse repetition rate is about 1 MHz, then the transmitted data rate is gigabits 

per  second.    SLMs  based  on  MQW  technology  with  a  frame  rate  of  several  MHz  are  now 
available.7 

2. Scintillations Reduction Due to Time Averaging of a Partially Coherent Beam  

It  is  well-established  that  for  long  distances  the  scintillation  index  of  plane  and  spherical  waves 
propagating  through  the  atmospheric  turbulence  asymptotically  tends  to  unity.9  For  an  initially 

partially coherent beam, the asymptotic behavior depends on the relation between the correlation 

time  of  the source  and the  response  time  of the  photodetector.  If the average  correlation  time of 

two  different  coherent  spots  in  the  beam’s  cross  section  is  shorter  than  the  response  time  of  the 
photodetector, then the scintillation index asymptotically tends to zero.10-13 If the correlation time 

of  the  coherent  spots  is longer than the  response  time  of  the  photodetector,  then  the scintillation 
index  asymptotically  tends  to  unity.13,14    As  was  shown  in  13,  these  properties  of  a  partially 

coherent  beam  can  be  easily  explained  if  we  assume  that  the  scintillations  at  the  photodetector 

follow Gaussian statistics. Indeed, if the coherence radius, 

cr , of the initial beam is significantly 

smaller than the beam radius,  0r , the process of propagation of the laser beam can be considered as 

the  independent  propagation  of  a  large  number  of  coherent  beams.  Consequently,  the  intensity 

fluctuations  of  each  coherent  region  caused  by  atmospheric  turbulence  are  statistically 

independent. With increasing the propagation distance, the individual coherent spots overlap due to 

diffraction effects. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the intensity, which is the result of the 

contributions of a large number of independent regions, has a normal statistical distribution. The 

suppression of scintillations in the signal measurements is strictly due to the unique properties of 

the  Gaussian  statistics.  The  fluctuations  in  the  signal  generated  by  a  photodetector  with  slow

response time:

result,  from  Eq.  (1)  we  obtain 

〈

( ) (

is  equal  to  zero.  In  the  opposite  case,  when  the  correlation  time  is  much 

longer  than  the  photodetector  response  time, 

T τ(cid:19) ,    the  second  term  in  the  expression  (4)  is 

c

equal to the first term, and the scintillation index is equal to unity.  

As the above considerations show, in order to exploit the unique properties of Gaussian statistics, 

the  time  response  of  the  photodetector  must  be  much  longer  than  the  inverse  frame  rate  of  the 

SLM. Another requirement is that the number of individual coherent spots in the initial beam must 

be sufficiently large. In other words, the coherence radius, 

,cr  must be much smaller than the beam 

radius, 

0r .  Note  that  the  minimum  size  of  the  initial  coherence  radius, 

cr ,  is  limited  by  two 

physical effects. First, the angular spreading of the laser beam is defined by the diffraction angle, 

θ λ .  Consequently,  for  a  very  small  coherent  radius, 

~ / cr

cr ,  the  beam  spread  will  be 

unacceptably  large.  Second,  for  a  very  small  initial  coherence  radius,  the  diffraction  effect  will 

dominate  in  the  formation  of  the  beam  coherence  in  comparison  with  the  influence  of  the 
atmospheric turbulence. In this case, according to the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem15, the coherence 

radius will increase during the propagation. Thus, a very important requirement can be formulated: 

In  order  to  significantly  suppress  the  laser  beam  scintillations,  one  must  work  in  the  regime  in 

which  an  optimal  initial  coherence  radius, 

cr ,  is  chosen  which  satisfies  the  inequality, 

r
min

<

r
c

<

r
max

. The optimal initial coherence radius,  cr , depends on the strength of the atmospheric 

turbulence  and  the  propagation  length,  L.  The  adaptive  control  of  the  initial  coherence  can  be 

achieved using a feedback channel.  Either a rf   or an optical channel could provide feedback from 

the measurements of the scintillation index at the receiver to the SLM at the laser source.  

3. Calculation of the Scintillation Index for the Case of Strong Turbulence 

Our analysis is based on the equation for the fourth-order correlation function derived by Tatarskii 
in the Markov approximation.16,17. The equation for the correlation function

In Eq. (15),  0r  is the beam radius and  cr  is the coherence radius. We consider the case of small 

coherence radii in comparison with the beam radius: 

r(cid:19) . The conventional approach to the 

cr

0

problem of laser beam propagation is based on the assumption of small deviations of the beam

parameters from those which correspond to free-space propagation.1  This approach is limited to 

the conditions of weak turbulence or short propagation lengths. Another approach was developed 
by  Yakushkin.10  His  approach  is  based  on  the  fact  that  for  any  relatively  long  distance,  the 

coherence radius is smaller than the beam radius. Starting with the exact solution of  Eq. (9) for a 

beam  with 

cr = ,  Yakushkin  developed  a  perturbation  theory    in  which  the  small  parameter, 

0

cr r (cid:19)  is the ratio of the coherence radius  cr  to the beam radius 0r . In10 the case of an initially 

1,

0

fully  coherent  beam  was  considered.  Thus,  his  theory  was  actually  an  asymptotic  theory, 

applicable to relatively long distances. In our case, we have initially a partially coherent beam.

Hence our approach is applicable to any distance. In11 the approach10 was applied to the case of 
an initially partially coherent beam. However, the authors of 11 did not discuss the details of the 

intermediate  approximations.  Although,  their  results  are  qualitatively  similar  to  ours,  the  final 

expressions  are  different.  In  particular,  we  obtained  a  much  simpler  expression  for  the 
scintillation  index.  (See  below  the  expression  (21).)  Authors12  solved  the  quantum  kinetic 

equation for the photon distribution function. Their results are also qualitatively similar to ours. 
In 13 the author considered an incoherent source, which corresponds to the case of the coherence 

 

8

radius equal to zero in our consideration. The scintillation index in this case is equal to zero (see 
Fig.  1),  what  corresponds  to  the  case  of  infinitely  strong  turbulence  in  13.  The  formula  (21) 

describes the case of finite coherence radius, when the scintillation index is different from zero 

even in the case of very strong turbulence.  

The solution of Eq. (9) can be written in the integral form

The scintillation index decreases as the initial coherence radius, 

,cr  decreases, as can be seen in 

Fig. 1. For the coherence radii less than  4 , the scintillation index has a quadratic-like dependence. 

For  a  certain  value  of  the  coherence  radius,  a  larger  beam  radius  corresponds  to  a  smaller 

scintillation index.  Actually, the  scintillation  index decreases  linearly with  an  inverse number  of 

coherent spots

. Thus the scintillation index decreases by an order of magnitude 

as the coherence radius  cr  decreases from 3 to 1 (see Fig. 1). 

4.  Design of an Optical System Based on Spectral Amplitude Encoding  of 

      a Broad Band Pulsed Laser 

We propose to encode digital data in the spectrum of a wide-band source such as Ti: sapphire laser. 

We assume that this laser operates at a high repetition rate. Usually Ti: sapphire lasers can operate at 

a  repetition  rate  in  a  broad  range  from  a  few  Hz  up  to  GHz.  If  each  series  of  N  laser  pulses  (the 

number of pulses depends on the averaging time of the photosensor) contains kilobits of data and the 

series  repetition  rate  is  several  MHz,  then  the  data  rate  is  a  few  Gbps.  Usually,  information  is 

encoded as an amplitude modulation in time of a continuous wave laser beam. In this case, intensity 

fluctuations make significant contributions to the BER. Our spectral domain encoding technique is 

less sensitive to intensity and phase fluctuations because the information is decoded in a massively 

parallel  way  using  a  relatively  slow  photosensor,  which  minimizes  the  scintillations  by  time 

averaging. Spectral-domain encoding can be achieved using a wide-band Ti: sapphire laser with an 

electro-optical  SLM,  as  demonstrated  in  Fig.  2.  The  spectrum  of  each  laser  pulse  is  dispersed 

spatially and then encoded by the SLM whose pixels can be turned on and off. The light traversing 

the  SLM  will have  certain spectral bins  turned  on or off,  depending  on  whether  the  corresponding 

pixels of the SLM are on or off.  In our approach, the spatial coherence of the initial beam is also 

formed  by  the  SLM.    The  encoded  signal  is  sent  through  a  second  SLM  which  modifies  the 

transverse coherence of the beam. The optimal value of the radius of coherence,  cr , is maintained by 

using  a  feedback  loop  between  the  SLM  and  the  photosensor  (not  shown).  At  the  receiver,  the 

  

 

 

 

11

wavelength-modulated  signal  is  dispersed  in  an  optical  spectrometer,  i.e.  a  monochromator,  and 

detected by a high-speed charge-coupled device (CCD). The electronic signal from the CCD is then 

processed by a high-speed data processing unit. Note, that in our method the spectral grating spreads 

the spectrum of the laser pulse along a single coordinate. Therefore we need a single array LSM for 

encoding and a single array CCD for sensing.

5. Utilization of LEDs  for Short-Distance FSOC 

 The  problem  of  low-cost,  high-speed  connections  of  individual  customers  with  backbone  optical 

fiber channels is known as the “last mile bottleneck” problem. The increasing demand for wireless 

connection  to  optical  fiber  channel  stimulated  needs  of  FSOC  technology  for  distances  of  0.25–

1mile. Being a rapid deployment system, short-distance FSCO can be used also for disaster recovery 
following  natural  catastrophes  and  terrorist  attacks18.    Until  recently,  FSOC  used  lasers  as  light 

sources. The LED as a source was considered as undesirable for three reasons: i) limited modulation 

frequency  (typically  up  to  100  Mbps),  ii)  high  radiation  divergence,  and  iii)  low  power.  However, 

13

when compared with lasers for short-distance FSOC, LEDs have the advantages of higher reliability, 

reduced  temperature  sensitivity,  immunity  to  optical  feedback,  and  lower  cost.  For  these  reasons, 
LEDs are utilized for short distance FSOC with moderate data rates limited by 100 Mbps.18 

    Since  LEDs  are  a  source  of  spontaneous  non-coherent  emission,  their  emission  has  Gaussian 
statistics with a very short coherence time, of the order 10-13 s or less. Contrary to the conventional 

time  domain  encoding  technology,  the  spectral  encoding  technology  does  not  require  high 

modulation rates: A modulation rate of about several MHz can provide a channel with a Gbps data 

rate.  

6. Conclusion 

We have presented the new concept of a free space, a few Gbps speed optical communication system 

based  on  spectral  encoding  of  radiation  from  a  broadband  pulsed  laser.  We  have  shown  that,  in 

combination  with  control  of  the  partial  coherence  of  the  laser  beam  and  the  relatively  slow 

photosensor,  scintillations  can  be  suppressed  by  orders  of  magnitude  for  communication  distances 

beyond  10  km.  Also,  we  considered  the  spectral  encoding  of  radiation  of  a  LED  as  a  gigabit  rate 

solution of the “last mile” problem and a rapid deployment system for disaster recovery.

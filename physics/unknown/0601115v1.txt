Abstract 

Thick  GEM-like  (THGEM)  gaseous  electron  multipliers  are  made  of  standard  printed-

circuit  board  perforated  with  sub-millimeter  diameter  holes,  etched  at  their  rims. 
Effective gas multiplication factors of 105 and 107 and fast pulses in the few nanosecond 

rise-time  scale  were  reached  in  single-  and  cascaded  double-THGEM  elements,  in 

atmospheric-pressure  standard  gas  mixtures  with  single  photoelectrons.  High  single-

electron  detection  efficiency  is  obtained  in  photon  detectors  combining  THGEMs  and 

semitransparent UV-sensitive CsI photocathodes or reflective ones deposited on the top 

THGEM  face;  the  latter  benefits  of  a  reduced  sensitivity  to  ionizing  background 
radiation. Stable operation was recorded with photoelectron fluxes exceeding MHz/mm2. 

The properties and some potential applications of these simple and robust multipliers are 

discussed.

1.  Introduction 

We  describe  the  operation  mechanism  and  recent  advances  in  Thick  GEM-like 

(THGEM) electron multipliers, operating at atmospheric pressure. The THGEM [1] is 

a robust, simple to manufacture, high-gain gaseous electron multiplier. Its operation is 

based on gas multiplication within small, sub-millimeter to millimeter diameter holes, 

in a standard double-face Cu-clad printed circuit board. 

Gas avalanche multiplication within small holes is attractive because the avalanche-

confinement  in  the  hole  strongly  reduces  photon-mediated  secondary  effects.  In 

addition,  hole-multiplication  provides  true  pixilated  radiation  localization.  Hole-

multiplication  has  been  the  subject  of  numerous  studies  in  a  large  variety  of 

applications.  Among  them:  optical  particle  tracking  by  gas  discharge  in  capillary 

plates  and  tubes  [2];  Gamma  radiation  detection  with  small  diameter  lead-glass  and 

other tube-like converters, followed by charge multiplication within the holes [3, 4]; 

proportional  amplification  in  other  structures  like  the  Micro-Well  [5]  and  the  glass 

Capillary Plates (CP) [6,7] etc. 

The  most  attractive  and  extensively  studied  hole-multiplier  is  the  Gas  Electron 

Multiplier (GEM) [8], made of 50-70-µm diameter holes chemically etched in a 50-

µm  thick  metalized  Kapton  foil.  An  electric  potential  applied  between  the  GEM 

electrodes  creates  a  strong  dipole  electric  field  within  the  holes,  responsible  for  an 

efficient focusing of ionization electrons into the holes and their multiplication by gas 

avalanche  process  therein.  The  GEM  operates  in  a  large  variety  of  gases,  including 
noble-gas mixtures, providing a gain of ~104 in a single element and gains exceeding 
106  in  a  cascade  of  3-4  elements  [9,10].  The  avalanche  process  is  fast (typical rise-

time  of  a  few  ns)  and  free  of  photon-mediated  secondary  effects,  due  to  the  optical 

opacity of the GEM electrodes. In addition to its use for particle tracking [11] and in 

Time  Projection  Chambers  (TPC)  [12],  the  GEM  can  also  be  efficiently  coupled  to 

gaseous or solid radiation converters, resulting in a large variety of radiation detectors 

developed for imaging of x-rays [13,14], neutrons [15] and UV-to visible light [16]. 

A more recent hole-multiplier derived from the GEM is the Micro-Hole & Strip Plate 

(MHSP) [17,18]; it provides electron multiplication in GEM-like holes followed by a 

second multiplication stage on thin anode strips patterned on the bottom of the same 

electrode.  High  gains  are  reached  in  a  single  MHSP  element,  even  in  noble  gas 

mixtures  [19].  Cascaded  MHSP  and  GEM  multipliers  present  high  gains  and 

significantly reduced yield of avalanche ions back-flowing to the first element in the 

cascade,  with  an  important  impact  on  the  detector's  properties  [20].  The  success  of 

GEMs and glass Capillary Plates triggered the concept of a coarser structure, named 

by  its  authors  the  “optimized  GEM”,  made  by  drilling  millimetric  holes  in  a  2mm 

thick Cu-plated G-10 printed-circuit board (PCB) [21,22]. These multipliers yielded 
gains of 104 in Ar/isobutane (95:5) and in pure Xe; gains of 103 were reached in pure 

Xe in combination with a CsI photocathode (PC). 

 

Our THGEM described in this work, is fabricated in standard PCB technique; unlike 

the  “optimized  GEM”,  our  concept  combines  in  addition  to  hole  drilling  in  a  PCB 

also  chemical  etching  of  the  rim  around  each  hole  (Fig.1).  The  latter  was  found 

essential  for  reducing  considerably  discharges  at  the  hole’s  rim,  resulting  in  higher 

permissible voltages and higher detector gains. 

The  THGEM  is  mechanically  an  expansion  of  the  standard  GEM,  with  its  various 

dimensions  being  enlarged  by  factors  ranging  from  5  to  50.  But  though  the 

geometrical dimensions are expanded by large factors, most parameters governing its 

operation, e.g. operation voltage, electric fields, electron diffusion, etc. do not scale 

accordingly. Therefore, the optimization of the THGEM parameters required a broad 

systematic  study.  In  the  previous  [1,23]  and  in  the  present  works,  we  have 

investigated a large variety of THGEM geometries over a broad pressure range (0.5-

760 Torr); we will discuss in this and in a following article [24] the optimal geometry 

in  terms  of  hole  diameter,  hole  spacing  and  electrode  thickness,  for  different 

applications at atmospheric and at low gas pressures. 

The  THGEM  operation  principle,  shown  in  Fig.2,  is  similar  to  that  of  the  standard 

GEM. Upon application of a voltage difference across the THGEM, a strong dipole 

field Ehole is established within the holes. Electrons deposited by ionizing radiation in 

a  conversion  region  above  the  THGEM,  or  produced  on  a  solid  radiation  converter 

(e.g. a PC), are drifting towards the THGEM under the field Edrift and are focused into 

the THGEM holes by the strong electric field inside the holes. The radiation converter 

can  be  a  semitransparent  (ST)  one,  placed  above  the  THGEM,  or  a  reflective  (Ref) 

one,  deposited  on  the  THGEM  top  surface.  We  denote  these  semitransparent  and 

reflective  modes,  respectively.  With  a  Ref  PC  the  most  appropriate  Edrift  value  is  0, 

like  in  a  GEM  [25],  as  discussed  below;  with  a  ST  one,  some  finite  drift  field  is 

required (see section 3.3 below). The electrons are multiplied within the holes under 

the  high  electric  field  (~  25-50  kV/cm,  see  below);  depending  on  the  size  and 

direction of the field Etrans, a fraction of the resulting avalanche electrons are collected 

on  the  THGEM  bottom  electrode  while  the  rest  may  be  further  transferred  to  a 

collecting anode or to a second, possibly similar, multiplier element. Each hole acts as 

an  independent  multiplier;  the  avalanche  confinement  within  the  holes  has  the 

advantage  of  reduced  photon-mediated  secondary  effects;  this  leads  to  high-gain 

operation in a large variety of gases, including highly scintillating ones like pure CF4. 

Photon detectors having a Ref PC deposited on the THGEM top face are particularly 

interesting:  in  this  geometry  the  PC  is  totally  concealed  from  avalanche-induced 

photons  and  therefore  no  photon-feedback  effects  are  present.  As  the  latter  are  a 

major  performance-limiting  mechanism  of  photon-imaging  detectors  [20],  their 

suppression is of an advantage for conceiving high-efficiency photon detectors with 

sensitive  PCs.  The  role  of  ion-induced  secondary  effects  [20],  their  amplitude  in 

THGEMs and conditions for their reduction will be discussed below. 

In  this  article  we  will  concentrate  on  the  THGEM’s  operation  mechanism  and 

properties at atmospheric pressure. We shall present results demonstrating the role of 

each  geometrical  and  operational  parameter  of  the  THGEM.  The  operation  and 

properties of photon detectors with ST and Ref PCs and of soft x-ray detectors will be 

described.  The  interesting  THGEM  properties  at  low  gas  pressures,  of  which  some 

preliminary results are given in [1], will be the subject of another article [24]. 

 

2.  Methodology 

The present study encompasses the production of THGEM electrodes, calculations of 

electric  fields  by  the  MAXWELL  software  package  [26],  simulations  of  electron 

transport by the GARFIELD software  [27]  and systematic measurements of various 

operation properties of the THGEM. For the sake of clarity the details of each of the 

measurements will be provided in the next section, together with the relevant results. 

2.1. THGEM production procedure 

The THGEM electrodes were produced in the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) industry 

[28], by a standard drilling and etching process, out of double-clad G-10 plates. Some 

of the electrodes were produced in KEVLAR, as discussed below. We used plates of 

a thickness t = 0.4 – 3.2 mm; the insulator was first drilled with a hexagonal pattern 

of holes of a diameter d = 0.3 – 2 mm and a pitch a = 0.7 – 4 mm; and then the copper 

was etched at a 0.1mm distance around the hole's rim (Fig.1). A large assortment of 

THGEM electrodes was produced by this very economic method; table 1 summarizes 

the various THGEM geometries studied in the present work. 

2.2. MAXWELL and GARFIELD simulations 

MAXWELL  software  was  used  to  calculate  the  electric  field  maps  (direction  and 

values) in the vicinity of the THGEM electrode, within its holes and at its surface (fig 

3).    They  were  fed  into  the  GARFIELD  simulation  package,  providing  the  electron 

and  ion  paths,  including  diffusion,  and  the  electron  multiplication  within  the  holes 

(fig.  2,  4).  These  tools  allowed  examining  a  large  variety  of  electrode  geometries, 

verifying our measurements in a given gas mixture and understanding the processes 

involved in the THGEM operation. 

2.3. Experimental techniques 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We have measured the following properties: 

•  Electron  Transfer  efficiency  (ETE)  –  the  probability  to  focus  the  electron 

from  its  creation  point  into  a  hole.  For  a  gas-ionization  electron  the  ETE 

includes only the transport of the electron. For a photoelectron emitted from a 

PC, the ETE includes also the extraction efficiency from the PC into the gas, 

which  depends  on  the  electric  field  on  the  PC  surface  [29].  The  ETE  is  an 

important  parameter  for  any  hole-multiplication  detector,  affecting  its 

operation; e.g. the detection efficiency of single-electron events or the energy 

resolution  of  charged  particles  or  x-rays  inducing  ionization  electrons  in  the 

conversion  gap  preceding  the  THGEM.  The  ETE  depends  on  the  detector's 

operation mode and conditions; it was measured in various gases as function 

of the THGEM operation voltage in single-multiplier geometry. 

•  Effective gain (Geff) – the product of the absolute multiplication factor in the 

holes and the ETE. Geff was measured in different gases, in various THGEM 

geometries;  it  was  assessed  both  in  single-  and  double-element  cascaded 

modes; in the latter, Geff represents the product of the absolute multiplication 

factors in both THGEMs, the ETE into both multiplier's holes and the electron 

extraction efficiency from the first element into the gap between them. (note 

Geff  does  not  include  the  charge  transfer  efficiency  to  the  readout  anode,  as 

common in the literature).  

•  Counting-rate response – the dependence of pulse-height on the event rate. 

•  Ion  back  flow  fraction  (IBF)  –  the  fraction  of  ions  created  in  the  final 

avalanche  that  flow  back  and  are  collected  at  the  PC  (or  penetrate  the 

ionization region; Fig.2). 

gases. 

We have also measured the x-ray energy resolution and the pulse rise-time in some 

All  measurements,  except  the  x-ray  energy  resolution,  were  carried  out  with 

photoelectrons  emitted  from  a  CsI  PC,  irradiated  with  UV  light  from  a  continuous 

Ar(Hg) lamp or from a spontaneously discharging H2 lamp. The experimental setups 

for the different measurements are described in paragraph 3. The PC was either a thin 

(30nm) ST film, vacuum deposited on a Quartz window, pre-coated with a very thin 

(2-3nm)  under-layer  of  Cr,  or  a  thick  (300nm)  Ref  film,  vacuum-deposited  on  the 

THGEM's top face. The ST mode with the PC placed a few mm above the multiplier, 

represents  the  operation  mode  of  a  THGEM  coupled  to  any  source  of  electrons 

located  in  the  gap  above  it;  besides  the  photomultiplier  configuration,  it  could  be  a 

conversion gas gap for ionizing particles in a tracking detector or in a TPC, an x-ray 

conversion gap or another multiplier preceding the THGEM. 

We used an individual power supply for each electrode, permitting to independently 

vary  the  different  fields.  A  current  limit  of  50nA  was  usually  set  on  the  power 

supplies biasing the THGEMs (CAEN, model N471A) and a 22 MOhm serial resistor 

was added to limit eventual discharge currents. The light-source intensity was tuned 

with a series of absorbers placed in front of the lamp, adopting the light flux to the 

THGEM gain, within the above-mentioned current limits. 

Except for the ETE, all measurements were carried out by recording the current from 

various electrodes in the different experimental setups. In most cases the current was 

measured  on  electrodes  grounded  through  the  precision  electrometer  (KIETHLY 

610C),  recording  currents  down  to  10  pA;  in  some  cases  the  currents  on  powered 

electrodes  were  measured  indirectly  by  recording  the  voltage  drop  across  a  known 

resistor,  which  permitted  measuring  currents  in  the  range  of  10pA  to  100  nA.  The 

precision of these measurements was of 1% and 5%, respectively. 

At very low THGEM voltages, below the multiplication threshold, the ETE can also 

be derived from the current measurements, by comparing IOUT, the output current of 

the  THGEM  (i.e.  collected  on  the  interconnected  THGEM  bottom  and  mesh  M2 

electrodes – figure 3) to IPC, the photocurrent emitted from the PC (measured at the 

PC with a field Edrift established and no multiplication in the THGEM). But, as soon 

as the multiplication in the holes starts, this current measurement is no more valid for 

the  ETE  assessment;  we  cannot  separate  the  ETE  from  the  effects  and  charges 

resulting from the multiplication process [25]. In this range, the ETE was measured in 

a  pulse-counting  mode  that  permits  separating  the  two  processes.  It  is  based  on 

recording  single-electron  pulses,  in  which  case  electron  transfer  inefficiency  is 

directly  translated  to  counting-rate  deficiency.  We  used  a  relative  measurement, 

comparing  the  counting  rate  in  the  examined  system  to  that  recorded  in  a  reference 

system  known  to  have  100%  ETE.  This  is  done,  of  course,  under  exactly  the  same 

experimental  conditions,  with  identical  PC,  UV-light  illumination,  and  total  pulse-

gain and electronics chain. The pulse-counting method was used to obtain the transfer 

efficiency  of  the  THGEM  with  either  semitransparent  or  reflective  PCs,  in  various 

gases. The technique details are given in [30,25] and in chapter 3 below. 

 

 

 

3.  Results and discussion 

3.1. MAXWELL & GARFIELD simulations 

MAXWELL  and  GARFIELD  simulations  were  found  to  be  very  useful  for 

understanding  the  role  of  the  various  geometrical  parameters  of  the  THGEM 

electrode  and  for  comprehending  their  operation  mechanism  and  the  expected 

performance. A few examples will be given below.    

MAXWELL  calculation  results  of  the  electric  field  strength  Ehole  along  the  hole's 

central  axis,  for  THGEM#9  (Table  I)  with  ∆VTHGEM=2kV,  is  shown  in  fig.5.  It 

reaches a maximum of ~40 kV/cm at the middle of the hole and remains above the 

multiplication threshold (10-15 kV/cm) along an additional ~ 0.3 mm distance outside 

the hole; it indicates that the gas multiplication will typically extend out of the hole 

under  the  maximal  2  kV  bias.  Other  calculations  showed  that  the  avalanche  will  be 

fully confined within the hole at ∆VTHGEM =1.3kV [31]. A similar effect was noticed 

with  a  standard  GEM  in  noble  gases  [32],  showing  evidence  for  the  avalanche 

extending-out by much more than the hole radius. 

Figure  6.  Shows  the  results  of  MAXWELL  calculation  of  Ehole  in  a  THGEM  with 

t=0.4 mm, for different hole diameters. With decreasing hole diameter, Ehole increases 

and  becomes  more  confined  within  the  hole.  The  resulting  performance  in  terms  of 

maximal  Ehole  (and  therefore  the  expected  gain)  shows  an  optimum  for  t/d=  ~  1,  as 

will be discussed in the paragraph describing the gain results. 

MAXWELL/GARFIELD  calculations  gave  us  another  insight  into  the  operation 

mechanism, as for example to the effect of the transfer field. In Fig. 4 the avalanche is 

simulated in a cascaded double-THGEM#9 in Ar/CO2 (70:30), with ∆VTHGEM=1350V 

on  each  multiplier  and  a  high  (3  kV/cm)  transfer  field  between  them.  At 

∆VTHGEM=1350V the multiplication is~30 (this low gain was chosen for the sake of 

clarity of the figure); the total calculated gain is~900. This is a surprisingly high total 

gain, equal to the product of the two individual gains. With higher ∆VTHGEM and Etrans 

values  the  calculated  total  double-THGEM  gain  exceeds  the  product  of  the  two 

individual ones. 

MAXWELL/GARFIELD  provided  the  clue  for  this  effect,  showing  that  the  high 

transfer  field  modifies  the  field  near  the  hole's  edge  (fig.  7),  thus  modifying  the 

multiplication factor. The effect is expected to be significant at the higher ∆VTHGEM 

values,  where  the  avalanche  further  extends  out  of  the  hole.  Furthermore,  from 

GARFIELD  calculations  it  is  clear  that  a  high  transfer  field  is  responsible  for  the 

efficient extraction of electrons from the first THGEM towards the second one in a 

cascade; the large hole size together with the extension of the field out of the hole is 

responsible  for  an  efficient  focusing  of  the  electrons  into  the  second  THGEM.  As 

will be shown in the next section this was confirmed experimentally.  

The electric field on the top surface of the THGEM is shown in fig 8, along the line 

interconnecting two adjacent hole centers, for various ∆VTHGEM values. For ∆VTHGEM 

>800  V  the  field  exceeds  3  kV/cm  all  over  the  surface.  Under  this  relatively  high 

electric field, in a multiplier layout with a ref PC, the photoelectron backscattering in 

the  gas  is  low  [29];  this  guarantees  its  efficient  extraction  from  the Ref  PC  into  the 

gas. 

 

 

3.2 Effective Gain 

The  experimental  method  for  assessing  the  THGEM  gain  was  explained  above;  the 

experimental  schemes  are  given  in  [1]  and  in  [24]  for  detector  configurations  with 

Ref- and ST- photocathodes and for double-THGEMs. The gain results are shown in 

figures 9-12 for various THGEM parameters and operating gases. 

Fig.  9  demonstrates  that  a  single  THGEM  provides  up  to  a  10-fold  higher  effective 

gain  than  a  standard  GEM.  The  maximum  gain,  defined  by  the  onset  of  sparks,  is 

naturally reached at different ∆VTHGEM values, according to the multiplier's geometry. 

Fig. 10 shows the absolute effective gain of THGEM#9 in various gases; the highest 
effective-gain  values,  ~105,  were  reached  in  standard  mixtures  employed  in  GEMs; 

CF4,  which  is  an  important  gas  for  applications  in  windowless  Cherenkov  detectors 

[29,33], yields a maximum gain of 104, though at very high ∆VTHGEM values. Fig. 11 

shows  the  gain  of  a  double-THGEM#9  in  Ar/CH4  (95:5)  at  Etrans  =3kV/cm  and  in 

Ar/CO2  (70:30),  at  Etrans  values  of  1  and  3kV/cm;  at  3kV/cm,  the  double-element 

multiplier yields up to 100-fold higher gains compared to that of a single-multiplier, 
reaching total effective gains of ~ 107. Other electrodes were tested, e.g. THGEM#10, 

providing similar results. As will be discussed below in section 3.3, at the effective-

gain values above a few hundreds, the ETE reaches 100% and therefore the effective 

gain is equal to the true gas multiplication factor within the holes. 

The  effect  of  Etrans  on  the  total  gain,  discussed  in  3.1,  is  demonstrated  in  figure  11, 

showing that double-THGEM gains exceeding the product of two individual gains are 

obtained with a high Etrans and high ∆VTHGEM values. This was tested in various gases 

and with different electrode configurations, showing systematically a similar behavior 

[31]. The double-THGEM structure provides very high total gains, while the voltages 

on each element are far from the sparking limit, which permits a spark-free operation. 

It was noted that the most spark-free double-THGEM operation is the symmetric one, 

namely with both elements biased at equal operation voltages. We also noted that the 

0.1 mm etched Cu around the drilled holes is essential for achieving spark-free high 

gain. An attempt to operate a THGEM electrode, in which such etching was not done, 

resulted  in  ~10  times  smaller  maximal  gain  [24].  It  is  also  important  to  have  the 

etched and drilled patterns precisely centered. In our case the precision was ~ 20µm. 

Electrodes in which the etched pattern was largely displaced from the drilled one did 

not function properly, and yielded up to10-fold smaller maximal gain (fig 12). 

The hole pitch of the THGEM was found to have a minimal effect on the gain. For 

example,  the  onset  of  the  multiplication  in  THGEM#10,  having  a  pitch  of  a=1mm, 

started  a  few  tens  of  volts  earlier  than  in  THGEM#9,  with  a  pitch  a=0.7mm.  Both 

multipliers reached similar maximum gains in Ar/CO2 (70:30) (Figure 13). The effect 

was  systematically  observed  also  at  the  low-pressure  range  [24].  There  is  no  clear 

explanation at the moment and it does not seem to be supported by our MAXWELL 

calculations.    

The  high  gain  obtained  with  the  double-THGEM,  permitted  recording  single-

photoelectron  signals  with  a  fast  current  amplifier  (Fig  14).  The  relatively  fast 

multiplication process yields pulses with a few ns rise-time. 

3.3. Electron Transfer Efficiency 

 

 

configurations: 

We have measured the ETE and its dependence on the THGEM voltage, in two basic 

a)  Ref  PC,  in  which  the  single  electrons  originate  from  a  PC  deposited  on  the  top 

surface  of  the  multiplier  and  the  field  Edrift  above  it  is  set  to  0.  In  these  Edrift 

conditions,  like  in  a  reflective-GEM  [34,25],  the  photon  detector  has  a 

considerably  reduced  sensitivity  to  ionizing  particle  background  [33].  We  also 

varied Edrift around 0 and measured the resulting ETE variation. 

b)  ST PC, in which the single electrons originate from a PC placed a few mm above 

the THGEM electrode, with a field Edrift between them; in this configuration the 

measured ETE is relevant for ST photon detectors (with Edrift >0.5 kV/cm) and for 

tracking detectors and TPCs (with Edrift typically in the range of 0.1kV/cm). It is 

also relevant for the understanding of the operation mechanism of two THGEMs 

in  cascade,  where  avalanche  electrons  created  in  the  first  multiplier  should  be 

efficiently focused into the second one. 

Fig. 15 depicts the setup and method for ETE measurement with a ref PC, which has 

two  steps:  first  we  set  Edrift  =  -3kV/cm  and  measure  the  event  rate  originating  from 

electrons  created  at  the  Ref  PC  and  multiplied  at  the  MWnor  anode.  The  high  Edrift 

ensures  full  photoelectron  extraction  efficiency;  the  electric  field  established  on  the 

MW  side  of  the  mesh  M1  is  higher  than  6kV/cm,  ensuring  full  electron  transfer 

through M1. We may thus assume that in this configuration the ETE is 1. Then, with 

the same light flux and electronics chain, we set Edrift= 0 and measure the event rate 

originating  from  electrons  entering  the  THGEM  and  being  multiplied  in  a  cascade: 

first  in  the  holes  and  further  on  MWtrans  anode.  This  two-stage  multiplication 

arrangement permits varying the THGEM gain while keeping a fixed total gain on the 

cascade. The ratio of event rates (ntrans/nnor) provided us with the ETE. 

The  validity  of  the  measurement  relies  on  the  assumption  that  in  both  cases  the 

single-electron  pulse-height  distribution  is  exponential,  following  the  Polya  relation 

without saturation

G being the gain, q being the amplitude [35]. Therefore it is important to adjust the 

total gain in both measurement steps to be identical within 2-5%, by comparing the 

slopes  of  the  exponential  distributions.  Furthermore,  we  measured  the  event-rate 

within a given window (Figure 16), set in the middle of the pulse-height distribution, 

safely  above  the  noise  and  below  the  tail,  to  avoid  counting  secondary  or  pile-up 

pulses.  The  method  is  no  more  valid  in  cases  where  the  multiplication  process  is 

strongly  affected  by  secondary  or  quenching  processes  and  the  distribution  fails  to 

follow the exponential relation. For a more detailed discussion of this method refer to 

[25,30,34]. 

The results of the ETE with Ref PC on a THGEM#9 in four gases investigated in this 

work, are shown in fig.17 as function of ∆VTHGEM. With CF4, in which multiplication 

starts at very high voltages (see fig. 10), ETE was evaluated by current measurement 

up to ~1400V and by pulse counting in the range above that. Full transfer efficiency 

is  obtained  at  rather  low  gains,  of  3-30,  according  to  the  gas  filling.  (Note  that  for 

ETE=1  Geff  equals  true  gas  multiplication).  This  could  be  compared  to  a  standard 

reflective  GEM,  in  which  full  ETE  was  attained  only  at  high  gains,  above  500  in 

Ar/CH4(95:5)  and  above  5000  in  pure  CF4  [25].  The  reason  is  the  denser  hole  area 

(46% of the area, compared to 22% in a standard GEM) and the larger hole diameter 

(300 µm compared to 50-70 µm in a standard GEM). Due to the large hole diameter, 

which is indeed larger than the electron diffusion (~100µm  for  1  cm  [36]),  electron 

focusing into the holes is more efficient and is typically obtained at smaller field (i.e. 

gains) compared to that of a standard GEM. The ETE of a better-suited multiplier for 

Ref GPMs, THGEM#10, which has a higher effective PC area of 77% (similar to that 

of  a  standard  GEM),  is  shown  in  Figure  18.  Due  to  the  larger  hole  distance  in  this 

case, a higher gain of ~500 is required for full electron transfer efficiency. 

In  fig.  19  we  show  the  dependence  on  Edrift  of  ETE  of  THGEM#9  with  ref  PC  in 

Ar/CH4  (95:5).  Like  in  a  GEM  [34,25]  full  transfer  efficiency  was  measured  for 

Edrift=0.  Setting  Edrift  at  slightly  reversed  (negative)  value  will  reduce  the  detector's 

sensitivity to ionizing background, as all ionizing electrons will drift away from the 

multiplier. 

Figure 20 depicts  the experimental  setup and method for measuring ETE with a  ST 

PC. The setup included two 20nm thick CsI layers deposited on both faces of a thin 

quartz plate, pre-coated with 2.5nm thick Cr. Similarly to the Ref PC mode described 

above,  we  had  a  normalization  and  a  measurement  step,  and  we  used  the  ratio  of 

event rates in both steps to provide the ETE. However, the normalization was done in 

two steps. First we recorded, under the same UV illumination and the same extraction 

field Edrift, the photocurrents from both sides of the quartz plate; this provided us with 

the  photocurrents  ratio  RI  between  the  top  Ref  PC  and  the  bottom  ST  PC.  Then  we 

preceded  as  above  and  measured  the  rate  of  events  recorded  in  the  defined  pulse-

height window,  for  events originating  from  the  top Ref  PC  and  amplified  in  the  top 

MWnor.  Finally  the  event  rate  was  measured  within  the  same  pulse-height  window 

and under the same illumination, for events originating from the ST PC and multiplied 

in the THGEM and the MWtrans in cascade, maintaining the same total detector gain 

and  electronics  chain.  The  ratio  of  the  two  event-rates,  normalized  by  the 

photocurrents ratio RI, provided us with the ETE, as function of ∆VTHGEM and of Edrift. 

The ETE results in the ST PC mode for THGEM#9 are shown in figure 21 as function 

of  ∆VTHGEM,  for  two  gases.  These  data  were  obtained  by  the  current-recording 

method in the voltage range below the multiplication onset, and by the pulse-counting 

method  in  the  multiplication  range.  Full  transfer  efficiency  was  attained  in  Ar/CO2 

(70:30) and in pure CH4 already at small respective gains of 100 and 10, with Edrift= 

0.3  V/cm.  (Note  that  for  ETE=1  Geff  equals  true  gas  multiplication).  As  in  standard 

GEM the electron focusing into the holes, and thus the ETE, is expected to drop when 

the  ratio  Edrift/Ehole  increases.  The  ability  to  maintain  full  ETE  at  higher  Edrift  was 
measured for THGEM effective gains of 10, 103 and 104, as seen in figure 22. A drop 

is observed at Edrift values above ~3kV/cm and ~5kV/cm for effective gains of 10 and 
103-104, respectively.   

As discussed above, the ETE measured with a ST PC is relevant also for the operation 

of  a  cascaded-THGEM  structure.  The  results  of  fig.  22  confirm  that  even  with 

transfer  fields  between  two  cascaded  elements  as  high  as  3kV/cm,  a  full  electron 

focusing into the second THGEM holes can be obtained. 

In  analogy  to  standard  GEM  operation  in  cascade,  the  charge  transferred  to  the 

second element depends not only on the ETE discussed above but also on the electron 

extraction  efficiency  from  the  first  multiplier  into  the  gap  between  them.  This 

efficiency  is  expected  to  increase  with  Etrans/Ehole.  Its  dependence  on  Etrans  was 

measured in a double THGEM configuration similar to that shown in fig. 4, with a ST 

PC.  First  we  measured  the  current  IB  collected  at  the  bottom  of  THGEM1,  with  a 

reversed Etrans, and then we measured the current IT on the top of THGEM2, with its 

top  and  bottom  interconnected,  as  function  of  Etrans.  The  ratio  IT/IB,  provides  the 

electron  extraction  efficiency  from  THGEM1  to  the  gap  between  the  THGEMs. 
Experimental data are shown in figure 23 for Ar/CO2 (70:30). At effective gain of 104 

full extraction efficiency from THGEM1 in this gas is achieved at Etrans>6kV/cm and 

65% at Etrans of 3 kV/cm. 

3.4 Counting rate capability 

 

 

The pulse-height dependence on the event rate is important for high-rate applications. 
Due to the reduced number of holes per mm2 compared to standard GEM, each hole 

contains higher electron (and ion) flux, which could be of a concern. 

The measurements were done in two steps, in a setup similar to that of figure 3, with 

a Ref PC deposited on a THGEM#10, and a mesh M1 placed a few mm above it. A 
collimated UV lamp illuminated a PC area of 7 mm2. The current limit on the power 

supplies  was  raised  to  500nA  and  all  current-limiting  resistors  were  removed.  First, 

the photocurrent I0 was measured on M1 as a function of the UV intensity with both 

sides  of  the  THGEM  interconnected  and  with  Edrift=3kV/cm.  This  provided  the 

photoelectron rate per unit area. Then Edrift was set to 0, the THGEM was biased with 

∆VTHGEM  to  a  known  gain  and  the  current  I1  was  recorded  at  the  THGEM  bottom, 

with a reversed Etrans, again as function of the UV intensity. I1/I0 provided the gain of 

THGEM#10 and its dependence on the impinging photoelectron flux. 

The  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  24  for  two  different  gains,  in  Ar/CO2  (70:30).  At 
gain  of  2×104  (maximal  gain  in  this  gas)  a  multiplication  drop  starts  at  ~107 
electrons/mm2sec. 
The results could be compared to that of a standard GEM operated at a gain of 104, 

irradiated with 5.9keV x-rays, where the pulse-height was constant up to a total event 
rate  of  105  converted  x-rays/mm2  sec  [37].  Assuming  about  250  electrons  per  x-ray 
this corresponds to ~ 2.5*107 electrons//mm2 sec. This very high rate capability, e.g. a 

few orders of magnitude higher than in wire chambers, could be of prime importance 

in some applications. 

3.5 Ion Backflow Fraction (IBF) 

 

 

IBF  is  relevant both  for TPCs, where the  ions are causing dynamic  field  distortions 

and for gaseous photomultipliers incorporating a solid PC, where the ions create PC 

physical  and  chemical  aging  and  induce  secondary  electron  emission  causing 

feedback pulses that limit the detector performance. A comprehensive discussion on 

the ion backflow in gaseous detectors, its consequences and methods for its reduction 

is given in [20]. 

In  the  present  work  we  have  measured  IBF  for  single-  and  double-THGEM 

structures, with ST PCs; the data is relevant for TPCs.    

The  IBF  for  a  single  THGEM#9  and  a  ST  PC  was  measured  in  a  setup  similar  to 

figure  3,  with  the  THGEM  bottom  and  M2  electrodes  interconnected  and  with 

varying Edrift. The IBF was deduced from the ratio of currents recorded on the PC and 

on the interconnected THGEM bottom and M2 electrodes. The results are shown in 

figure 25 as function of the field Edrift above the THGEM. The fraction of avalanche-

induced  ions  which  drift  towards  the  photocathode  is  less  than  2%  at  Edrift=0  and 

increases  almost  linearly  with  Edrift.  These  data  imply  that  in  double-THGEM 

operation with Etrans~3kV/cm between both THGEMs, less than 40% of the ions will 

be flowing from the second THGEM towards the first one. Out of this, part may be 

trapped at the first THGEM bottom electrode, thus reducing the IBF as compared to 

that in a single THGEM operation. The IBF graph shown in Fig. 25 was measured at 
a gain of 104. 

The IBF with double THGEM#10 and a semitransparent PC was measured in a setup 

similar  to  figure  4,  in  760  Torr  Ar/CO2  (70:30)  for  two  values  of  Etrans  and  with 

Edrift=1.2kV/cm.  Fig.  26.  The  IBF  drops  with  increasing  THGEMs  voltage.  This  is 

due to the increasing lateral spread of the avalanche, resulting in the majority of ions 

being created at points far from the hole axis. With a sufficiently large hole dipole-

field these ions are diverted and trapped on the top of THGEM2 and on the bottom of 

THGEM1. 

3.6.  Energy resolution 

 

 

 
The energy resolution of the THGEM#9 was assessed with 5.9 keV 55Fe x-rays in 740 
Torr Ar/CH4 (95:5); the source irradiated an area of ~7 mm2. A conversion gas gap of 

8.5 mm was added in front of the multiplier, with a drift field set to 1.25kV/cm. The 
detector  was  operated  at  a  gain  of  105.  Pulses  from  the  bottom  electrode  of  the 

THGEM  were  recorded,  via  a  charge-sensitive  preamplifier  (ORTEC  142)  and  a 

linear amplifier (ORTEC 570), on a multi-channel analyzer (fig 27); the resolution is 

~20% FWHM. For comparison, a resolution of 18% FWHM was recorded with 5.9 

keV x-rays in a standard GEM at a gain of 1000 in Ar/DME(80:20) [38]. 

4.  Summary 

The  THGEM  discussed  in  this  article  is  an  attractive  robust  and  economic  electron 

multiplier,  suited  for  applications  at  atmospheric  gas  pressure  requiring  large  area 

detectors  with  single-electron  sensitivity  and  moderate  (sub-mm)  localization 

resolution.  Possible  applications  could  be  in  large  TPC  readout  or  in  sampling 
elements in Calorimetry. The high attainable gains, of 104 –105 in a single multiplier 

and  10-100  times  higher  in  a  double-THGEM  multiplier,  are  due  to  the  large  hole 

size,  reduced  photon-feedback  and  efficient  electron  transport  processes.  The 

THGEM has spark-free operation in a variety of gases including pure CH4 and CF4. 

The rapid avalanche process developing across the hole results in fast signals, of few 

ns rise-time; the counting-rate capability is up to the range of ~10MHz/mm2 at a gain 
of 104. THGEM multipliers can be coupled to both gaseous ionization volumes and to 

solid  radiation  converters;  in  the  latter  configuration  the  converter  can  be  placed 

above the THGEM or deposited directly on its top face. In both cases the radiation-

induced emitted electrons are efficiently focused into the multiplication holes. X-rays 

were detected with a gas converter with an energy resolution of ~20% FWHM at 5.9 

keV. The solid converter material can be chosen according to the application; it can 

be a photocathode in gaseous photomultipliers [16], an x-ray converter (e.g. CsI) in 

secondary-emission  x-ray  imaging  detectors  [39]  or  a  neutron  converter  (e.g.  Li,  B, 

Gd,  polyethylene  etc.)  in  thermal-or  fast-neutron  imaging  detectors  [15].  Such 

detectors for fast-neutron imaging are under development at our group.  

From our systematic study we may conclude that the operation mechanism, as well as 

the  role  of  the  various  electric  fields  involved  in  the  THGEM  operation,  is  rather 

similar to that known for standard GEMs. 

In particular, we observed the following similarities and differences: 

•  The maximal voltage difference across the THGEM before sparks onset does not 

scale with the dimensions and the field inside the holes is smaller than in a GEM; 

but  due  to  the  larger  dimensions,  particularly  the  larger  thickness,  significantly 

higher gains are obtained. Furthermore, due to the larger hole-size (larger than the 

electron  diffusion)  electron  focusing  into  the  holes  is  more  efficient  and  is 

typically obtained at smaller gains compared to that of a standard GEM. 

• 

In our study of the role of each field we have confirmed that with a Ref PC the 

field Edrift above  the  THGEM  should  be 0,  to reach  maximum electron  focusing 

into the holes; it can be kept slightly reversed to reduce the sensitivity of detectors 

with solid converters to ionizing background. 

•  Unlike  a  GEM  coupled  to  a  ST  PC,  in  which  Edrift  should  be  kept  moderate  to 

avoid diverting the drifting electrons towards the metallic GEM surface, the large 

holes in the THGEM permit an operation with very high Edrift values; an efficient 

photoelectron focusing into the holes even at drift fields of 5kV/cm was measured 
with THGEM#9 at a gain of 104. This is important for the efficient extraction of 

photoelectrons or radiation-induced secondary electrons, particularly in noble-gas 

mixtures, where backscattering into the converter is high at low fields [40].   

•  The  dipole  field  within  the  holes  deflects  the  avalanche  electrons  towards  the 

bottom  face  of  the  THGEM,  but  with  a  strong  Etrans  underneath  the  THGEM 

electrode  the  charge  is  efficiently  diverted  and  transferred  into  the  following 

multiplier in the cascade. In standard cascaded GEMs this is an important issue of 

optimization, since with a too high Etrans the electrons will not be focused into the 

second GEM, while a too low Etrans will not extract the electrons from the first one 

[25]. With the large holes, electron focusing into the second THGEM in a cascade 

remains effective even with very high Etrans values, as with the high Edrift values 

discussed above. 

•  As a result, a double-THGEM operation was proved very efficient and spark-free 

in all tested gases, providing high total gains. Very high Etrans values, of several 

kV/cm, could be applied to increase the transfer efficiency and thus the total gain. 

In some cases, at high THGEM voltages and with a high Etrans value between the 

two elements, the total effective gain exceeded the product of the two individual 

ones.  This  peculiar  feature  is  occurring  firstly  because  the  extraction  of  charges 

from  the  holes  into  the  next  stage  is  very  efficient  and  reaches  almost  100%; 

furthermore,  because  the  dipole  hole-field  is  extending  out  by  about  the  hole’s 

diameter, at large gains part of the avalanche is developed outside the hole, thus 

being  susceptible  to  modifications  by  any  strong  field  in  the  gaps  around  the 

THGEM. The extension of the avalanche outside the hole might have undesirable 

consequences,  such  as  instability  due  to  photon-mediated  processes.  Thus  care 

should be taken to choose the appropriate operation conditions, such as THGEM 

geometry and applied voltages, specific for each application, in order to avoid this 

phenomenon. 

•  The electron transfer efficiency (ETE) with a reflective PC deposited directly on 

the  top  of  the  THGEM#9  was  found  to  reach  ~100%  at  rather  low  THGEM 

voltages (i.e. THGEM gain), in all gases studied. However, with THGEM#10, of 

larger pitch and of hole area similar to that of a standard GEM, higher THGEM 

voltages  (i.e.  THGEM  gains)  were  required  to  attain  full  ETE.  This  is  in  fact 

expected,  because  the  ETE  in  this  case  includes  also  the  electron  extraction 

efficiency from the PC to the gas, which requires high field (>0.5kV/cm) on the 

PC surface. With the larger pitch higher THGEM voltages are therefore required. 

•  Just as in a standard GEM, the flow of back-drifting ions is strongly related to that 

of  the  avalanche  electrons.  THGEMs  seem  to  have  efficient  electron  transport, 

and not surprisingly also efficient ion transport, as compared to GEMs. However, 

with  THGEM#10  (optical  transparency  identical  to  standard  GEM),  IBF  is 

typically slightly below 10% with fields suitable for ST PC operation. This result 

is quite similar to that obtained with 3GEM cascade [42] under similar conditions.  

Reducing ion backflow in THGEM cascades is the main subject  of  our ongoing 

research,  attempting  to  apply  the  idea  of  reversed-bias  multi-hole  &  strip 

electrodes (R-MHSP), recently shown [20] to reduce the ion backflow fraction by 
a factor of ~103 when incorporated in a cascaded structure. 

In  summary,  the  THGEM  can  be  easily  produced,  spanning  a  large  scale  of 

geometrical parameters: we have tested such electrodes with thickness ranging from 

0.4mm up to 3.2mm, and with hole sizes and distances in the same range. By varying 

the  thickness  and  the  hole  size  it  is  possible  to  optimize  the  THGEM  for  various 

operation  conditions,  as  for  example  the  operation  at  very  low  gas  pressures,  in  the 

mbar  range  [1,24].    Similarly,  varying  the  holes  pitch  affects  the  ETE  and  thus 

permits optimization of the electrode to a particular operation layout. The holes pitch 

also  affects  the  localization  precision  provided  by  this  electrode,  and  some 

optimization with regards to the localization demands are also possible here. The gain 
homogeneity and the localization properties of 100x100 mm2 THGEM detectors are 

the subject of another work. 

Though the gain in single-and double-THGEMs is high, further improvements could 

be  achieved  by  using  different  geometries.  One  example  is  using  smaller  hole 

diameter,  where  according  to  calculations,  Ehole  can  reach  much  higher  values. 

Conical  holes  shape,  like  in  the  standard  GEM,  may  also  be  tested.  For  UV-photon 

imaging in RICH applications, where the detector operates in CF4, the G-10 substrate 

failed reaching high gains following discharges [23]. This was attributed to possible 

damages caused by Fluor radicals to the glass fibers of the G-10 material. An attempt 

to  use  copper  clad  Kevlar  instead  of  G-10  did  not  provide  satisfying  results  so  far. 

Other  materials,  less  sensitive  to  CF4,  should  be  tested.  The  operation  of  THGEM 

imaging detectors under high radiation flux is the subject of an undergoing research. 

Further  studies  on  the  THGEM  should  include  the  investigation  of  temporal  gain 

stability  and  its  relation  to  up  charging  of  the  electrode  due  to  the  0.1mm  wide 

insulator  within  the  high  electric  field.  Some  evidence  of  temporal  instability  have 

been observed [42], which calls for optimization of the insulator width.

Figure Captions 

Figure 1.   A microscope photograph of a THGEM with thickness t = 0.4 mm, hole 

diameter d= 0.3 mm and pitch a= 0.7 mm. A rim of 0.1 mm is etched around the 

mechanically drilled holes. 

Figure 2.   The THGEM operation principle demonstrated by GARFIELD simulation at 

low gain (~30): electrons from gas ionization or from a photocathode (semitransparent or 

reflective) are focused into the holes and multiplied by an avalanche process under Ehole. 

Depending on the direction of Etrans, avalanche electrons are transferred to a second 

multiplier/readout electrode or collected at the THGEM bottom electrode, as shown here 

with a reversed Etrans. 

Figure 3.   Electric field map in THGEM#9 (table I) calculated by MAXWELL for 

∆VTHGEM=2kV, Edrift=0.1kV/cm and Etrans=3kV/cm; the latter are set by the potentials on 

meshes M1 (or photocathode) and M2. The calculated field Ehole within the holes varies 

between 10 - 40kV/cm. 

Figure 4.   GARFIELD simulation of the avalanche process in a double-THGEM#9, 

atmospheric pressure Ar/CO2 (70:30), ∆VTHGEM=1350 V. The multiplication factor of 

each THGEM is ~30, resulting in a total gain of ~900. With reversed Etrans all electrons 

are collected at the bottom of the second THGEM. 

Figure 5.   Ehole, the electric filed strength along the central hole axis, calculated by 

MAXWELL in a standard GEM and in a THGEM#9, for maximal operation voltages in 

Ar/CO2 (70:30): ∆VTHGEM=2kV; ∆VstandardGEM=0.5kV. 

Figure 6.   Ehole, the electric field strength along the central hole axis, calculated by 

MAXWELL for a fixed plate thickness t=0.4 mm and different hole diameter d. With 

decreasing hole diameter the field increases and is more confined within the hole. 

Experimental measurements show maximum gain for t/d ~ 1 (see figure 9 and text). 

Figure  7.      The  effect  of  Etrans  on  the  electric  field  strength  Ehole  along  the  hole  axis, 

calculated  by  MAXWELL.  As  seen  on  the  left  side  of  the  figure,  a  high  Etrans  applied 

above or below the THGEM may significantly affect the field strength just outside the 

hole and therefore the multiplication process. 

Figure  8.      The  electric  field  on  THGEM#9  top  surface,  Esurface,  calculated  by 

MAXWELL  along  the  line  interconnecting  two  hole  centers.  The  electric  field 

magnitude is above 3kV/cm, even at ∆VTHGEM = 800V. 

Figure 9.   Absolute effective gain measured with THGEMs of different geometries and 

with a standard GEM, in 740 Torr Ar/CH4 (95:5). The highest gains were recorded with 

THGEMs having t/d= ~1. 

Figure 10.   Absolute effective gain of THGEM#9, measured in different gases at 740 

Torr. 

and 3kV/cm. 

Figure 11.   Absolute effective gains of single- and double-THGEM#9 multipliers, 

measured in Ar/CH4 (95:5) with Etrans =3kV/cm, and in Ar/CO2 (70:30) with Etrans of 1 

Figure 12.   A THGEM#7 electrode with etched holes displaced by ~40 - 50 µm relative 

to the drilled ones has significantly lower maximal gain.  

Figure 13.   Varying the hole pitch from 0.7 to 1 mm has a minor effect on the gain curve. 

Figure 14.   A fast single-photon pulse, of 8 ns rise-time, measured in double-THGEM#7 
in 740 Torr Ar/CH4 (95:5) at a gain >106.  

Figure 15.   The experimental setup for the Electron Transfer Efficiency measurements in 

a reflective-photocathode mode. The pulses were measured on the upper, MWnor, and on 

the lower, MWtrans, multiwire detectors.  

Fig. 16:   Single-photoelectron spectra of the normalization and electron-transfer 

measuring steps, recorded on MWnor and MWtrans, respectively. The integration window 

is indicated.   

Figure 17.   ETE measured with THGEM#9, as function of ∆VTHGEM in a reflective 

photocathode mode, in various gases; full transfer efficiency is achieved at significantly 

lower gains compared to the standard GEM. 

Figure 18.   ETE measured with THGEM#9 and THGEM#10, as function of ∆VTHGEM in 

a reflective photocathode mode, in Ar/CO2 (70:30). 
Figure 19.   ETE measured with THGEM#9 at Geff=103, as function of Edrift in 

Ar/CH4(95:5); maximum ETE was obtained at Edrift=0. 

Figure 20.   The experimental setup for the Electron Transfer Efficiency measurements in 

a semitransparent photocathode mode. 

Figure 21.   ETE of THGEM#9 in the semitransparent photocathode mode, in Ar/CO2 
(70:30) and in pure CH4. Full ETE is reached at respective effective gains of 102 and 10, 

with Edrift=0.3kV/cm. 

Figure 22.   ETE of THGEM#9 in the semitransparent photocathode mode, as function of 

Edrift; Ar/CO2 (70:30) at different effective gains. 

Figure23.      Electron  extraction  efficiency  from  THGEM#9  to  the  gap  below  it,  at 
effective gains of 10 and 104 in Ar/CO2 (70:30), as function of Etrans. 

Figure 24.   Counting rate response of a single THGEM#10 with reflective photocathode 
in  Ar/CO2  (70:30).  At  effective  gain  of  2x104  multiplication  drop  starts  at  ~107 
electrons/mm2sec. 

Figure  25.      The  Ion  Backflow  Fraction  to  a  semitransparent  photocathode,  of  a  single 
THGEM#9 at effective gain of 104, as function of the field Edrift above the THGEM. 

Fig  26.      The  Ion  backflow  fraction  to  a  semitransparent  photocathode,  of  double 

THGEM#10,  as  function  of  the  total  effective  gain,  for  two  values  of  Etrans  and  with 

Edrift=1.2 kV/cm. The IBF is below 10% in this case. 
Figure  27.      An  energy  spectrum  recorded  with  5.9  keV  55Fe  X-rays  in  a  single-
THGEM#9, 740 Torr Ar/CH4 (95:5), effective gain 105.

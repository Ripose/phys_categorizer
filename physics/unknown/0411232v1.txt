We  demonstrate  femtosecond  performance  of  an  ultra-broadband  high-index-

contrast  saturable  Bragg  reflector  consisting  of  a  silicon/silicon-dioxide/germanium 

structure  that  is  fully  compatible  with  CMOS  processing.  This  device  offers  a 

reflectivity  bandwidth  of  over  700  nm  and  sub-picosecond  recovery  time  of  the 

saturable loss.  It is used to achieve mode-locking of an Er-Yb:glass laser centered at 

1540 nm, generating  220 fs pulses, with  the broadest output spectrum to date.

Passive mode-locking with a saturable Bragg reflector (SBR) is a powerful method to generate a 

steady  stream  of  pico-  or  femtosecond  pulses  from  a  laser  [1],  [2].  To  date,  SBRs  have  been 

fabricated both as bulk and quantum well devices from III-V compound semiconductor materials 

which are not compatible with the silicon material platform. In contrast, the silicon/germanium 

SBR  (Si/Ge-SBR)  demonstrated  here  consists  of  a  CMOS-compatible  silicon/silicon-dioxide 

(Si/SiO2) Bragg reflector and a germanium saturable absorber layer (Figure 1a). Due to the high 

refractive  index  contrast  (nSiO2=1.45  and  nSi=3.5),  only  six  layer  pairs  in  the  Bragg  mirror  are 

 

1

sufficient  to  achieve  a  maximum  reflectivity  of  99.8%.  On  top  of  the  Si/SiO2  Bragg  stack,  a 

germanium  saturable  absorber  layer  is embedded in a silicon  layer of  3λ/4 optical thickness at 

the center wavelength of 1400 nm. It resides at a peak of the standing wave pattern of the electric 

field to maximize absorption and minimize saturation intensity (Figure 1a).  

 

The  manufacturing  of  the  SBR  was  aimed  at  achieving  both  a  high  reflectivity  of  the 

Bragg mirror and a sufficiently-strong nonlinear response of the absorber layer for mode-locking 

an  Er-Yb:glass  laser.  The  6-pair  reflector  was  fabricated  by  repeating  poly-Si  deposition  and 

thermal  oxidation  using  a  silicon-on-insulator  (SOI)  wafer  as  the  starting  material  (Figure  1b, 

step 1). Then, the Bragg mirror was bonded with a new silicon substrate (Figure 1b, step 2). The 

silicon  handle  and  buried  oxide  of  the  SOI-wafer  were  chemically  etched  to  expose  the 

crystalline silicon layer of the SOI-wafer for successive germanium epitaxial growth (Figure 1b, 

step  3).  A  40  nm  thick  germanium  saturable  absorber  layer  was  deposited  by  the  UHV-CVD 

technique developed by Luan et al. [3] (Figure 1b, step 4). Finally, a thin oxide was grown on 

germanium  as  a  passivation  layer  and  a  poly-Si  cap  layer  was  deposited.  The  manufacturing 

process  including  bonding  of  a  new  substrate  and  removal  of  the  original  one  results  in  the 

reversal  of  the  Si/SiO2  layer  sequence  of  the  reflector  with  respect  to  layer  growth.  Thus,  the 

layers of lowest surface roughness – those that have been grown first – ending up topmost in the 

mirror,  exposed  to  the  highest  electric  field  strength,  while  the  rougher  layers,  grown  last,  are 

buried deep in the mirror (Figure 1a). This reversal of the layer sequence significantly reduces 

surface roughness and scattering losses, leading to an unprecedented 99%-reflectivity bandwidth 

of  700  nm  (Figure  2b).  Furthermore,  substrate  reversal  terminates  the  reflector  with  the 

crystalline silicon layer of the SOI-wafer rather than with polycrystalline material deposited on a 

 

2

Bragg mirror. It is the crystalline nature of this silicon layer that preserves the optical absorption 

properties  of  the  germanium  layer  to  achieve  saturable  absorption  in  the  silicon  /  germanium 

material system at 1550 nm. 

 

The nonlinear response of the device was characterized in a series of pump-probe measurements 

with 150 fs pulses centered at 1540 nm from an optical parametric oscillator. For low to medium 

fluence values (e.g. 40 µJ/cm2), the germanium layer acts as a fast saturable absorber with up to 

0.13% of modulation depth (Figure 2a). We observe sub-picosecond recovery of the bleaching, 

with  the  temporal  resolution  of  our  measurement  being  limited  by  the  pump  and  probe  pulse 

durations. We attribute the fast relaxation process to intervalley scattering within the conduction 

band.  In  contrast,  for  high  fluences  (e.g.,  300  µJ/cm2),  carriers  generated  by  two-photon 

absorption  (TPA)  induce  free  carrier  absorption  (FCA)  and  turn  the  germanium  layer  to  an 

inverse  saturable  absorber.  The  strong  inverse  saturable  absorption  of  the  Si/Ge-SBR  is  due  to 

the  TPA  in  the  germanium  layer  (βGe,1500nm  =  300  cm/GW)  which  is  much  greater  than  that  of 

silicon or gallium arsenide. The observed behavior leads to dual functionality of the Si/Ge-SBR 

in  a  mode-locked  laser:  (i)  the  fast  recovery  enables  ultrashort  pulse  generation,  (ii)  onset  of 

inverse saturable absorption at high fluences helps stabilize high repetition rate lasers against Q-

switching  by  limiting  the  maximum  intracavity  power  [4],  [5]  .  This  instability  has  prevented 

successful  mode-locked  operation  of  lasers  with  long  upper  state  lifetimes  and  high  repetition 

rates  until  recently  [6],  [7]  and  is  a  major  obstacle  for  compact  laser  integration.  The  thin 

germanium layer grown on silicon is compressively strained, leading to a shift of the bandgap by 

38  nm  to  shorter  wavelengths.  As  a  result,  absorption  of  the  germanium  sets  in  at  1580  nm 

(Figure  2b),  leading  to  a  total  loss  of  0.3%,  and  a  nonsaturable  loss  of  0.17%  at  the  laser

wavelength, as determined by comparison of the intracavity power obtained with the Si/Ge-SBR 

with different output couplers. In addition, a transmission electron micrograph revealed a small 

error in the SOI-layer thickness, placing the Ge-absorber layer slightly off the peak of the electric 

field. A larger modulation depth of the SBR can be expected from a precise positioning of the Ge 

layer  at  a  field  maximum,  as  well  as  by  the  use  of  a  thicker  layer.  From  pump  probe 

measurements we estimate the saturation fluence to be about 30 µJ/cm2. 

The  fast  recovery  time  of  the  Si/Ge-SBR  combined  with  its  high  reflectivity  leads  to 

superior spectral width and pulse duration of the bulk Er-Yb:glass laser mode-locked with this 

device. A phosphate glass Kigre QX/Er served as the gain medium in the laser. It is flat-Brewster 

polished, placed at one end of the four-element laser cavity (Figure 3a), and its flat side serves as 

an  output  coupler  with  99.8%  reflectivity.  The  laser  is  pumped  with  a  450  mW  fiber-coupled 

diode  laser  (Bookham,  type  G07).  The  overall  intracavity  loss  is  minimized  with  highly-

reflecting mirrors, low output coupling and a highly-reflecting Si/Ge-SBR, leading to an average 

intracavity power of 8.7 W. The laser is operated with a highly-saturated gain resulting in a flat 

gain profile to support a broad optical spectrum [8]. We obtain an optical spectrum centered at 

1550 nm with a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of 11 nm and covering the entire 

C-band of optical communications at approximately –10 dB level (Figure 3b). After dechirping 

the  pulses  extracavity  with  1.0  m  of  single  mode  fiber  (Corning  SMF-28),  the  inferred  pulse 

duration from the intensity autocorrelation is 212 fs (Figure 3d). Phase retrieval with an iterative 

algorithm  [9]  reveals  a  pulse  width  of  220  fs,  which  is  10%  larger  than  the  transform-limited 

value, obtained from the zero-phase Fourier transform of the power spectrum. To our knowledge, 

these are the shortest pulses generated from a bulk Er/Yb:glass laser to date [10], and about an 

 

 

4

order of magnitude shorter than those obtained solely from mode-locking of an Er/Yb:glass laser 

with an SBR [11]. The laser operates at a 169 MHz repetition rate with a clean RF spectrum and 

a noise floor more than 70 dB below the signal level (Figure 3c). No Q-switching behavior was 

observed  regardless  of  pump  power  level  despite  the  long  upper-state  lifetime  and  the  small 

emission cross section of the gain medium. We attribute the high stability against Q-switching to 

the inverse saturable absorption in the Si/Ge-SBR at high fluence.  

In  conclusion,  we  have  demonstrated  a  silicon/germanium  saturable  Bragg  reflector  fabricated 

with a CMOS compatible process. Its nonlinear response has been characterized by femtosecond 

pump-probe  measurements  showing  fast  saturable  absorber  behaviour  on  a  femtosecond  scale 

and  strong  inverse  saturable  absorption  at  large  fluence  values.  The  device  has  been  used  to 

attain  self-starting  operation  of  a  passively  mode-locked  Er-Yb:glass  laser  with  an  optical 

spectrum covering the entire C-band of optical communications. The larger modulation depth of 

the  present  device  at  shorter  wavelengths  with  the  broad  bandwidth  of  the  Si/SiO2  backmirror 

can be utilized in mode-locking other laser systems, such as Cr:Forsterite and Cr4+:YAG, which 

support few-cycle laser pulses. The development of a saturable absorber in the silicon material 

platform paves the way to the construction of chip-scale mode-locked lasers in the near future. 

We envision such lasers to become compact, low-noise and inexpensive light sources, that allow 

for new applications in optical communications [12], high-speed optical sampling [13], on-chip 

clocks [14] and low noise microwave oscillators [15].

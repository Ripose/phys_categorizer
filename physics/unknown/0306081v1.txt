ABSTRACT

This  study  shows  that  typical  pendulum  dynamics  is  far  from  the  simple  equation  of  motion
presented in textbooks.  A reasonably complete damping model must use nonlinear terms in addition to the
common linear viscous expression.  In some cases a nonlinear substitute for assumed linear damping may
be more appropriate.  Even for exceptional cases where all nonlinearity  may be ignored, it is shown that
viscous dissipation involves subtleties that can lead to huge errors when ignored. 

INTRODUCTION

(Note:    the  use  of  the  adjective,  'linear',  in  the  title  of  this  article  --  is  to  be  viewed  only  in  the
following  context  --  for    all  cases  considered,  the  amplitude  of  pendulum  motion  is  small  enough  for
reasonable validity of the approximation sin θ = θ .)

Preface
Because of the complexities of friction, most models of oscillator damping concentrate on a single
process.  For harmonic motion at small amplitudes within a fluid, the simplest energy loss is viscous loss
that is proportional to the velocity.  For an oscillating sphere, it is tempting to treat this friction as simply
the steady flow expression involving the viscosity  of  the  fluid  and  the  radius of  the  sphere  (Stokes  law).
We  will  see  that  such  an  approximation  results  in  huge  errors.    Not  only  must  one  account  for  'history
effects' because of the repetitive motion, but estimates of the damping generally require a full nonlinear fit
to decay records.  The 'least' additional friction that must be included is that which depends on the square of
the velocity.

The  20th  century  began  to  reveal  the  importance  of  damping  friction  that  is  internal  to  the
structure of an oscillator.  Just as the pendulum was an important instrument for the study of fluid (external)
friction, it is also vital to the study of  internal friction.  In studies of the pendulum, it has been common to
restrict one's attention to damping that derives only from the fluid.  Or if the pendulum were envisaged as
swinging in a vacuum -- to ignore any processes other than those localized at the axis; which is typically
either a knife-edge or a flex-pivot.  Both of these approaches are naive; it will be seen in the experiments
that follow, that a pendulum is generally influenced by mechanisms of both solid and fluid type, neither of
which can be properly viewed as completely linear.

Background
Before  the  developments  of  deterministic  chaos,  there  seemed  to  be  an  obsession  with  the
harmonic  (linear)  oscillator.      Our  understanding  of  more  realistic  macroscopic  vibrations  improved
dramatically  with  enlightenment  concerning  the  importance  of  elastic  nonlinearity.      While  the
developments of this period focused on elastic nonlinearity, there was little concern for a different type of
nonlinearity  that  begs  for  more  study--damping  that  is  other  than  the  classic  examples  which  have  been
known either for decades or centuries.

Early experiments demonstrated clearly that the linear approximations of common damping theory
were  useless,  when  applied  to  certain  classic  motions.    These  include  (i)  moving  in  a  fluid  at  higher
Reynolds  number,  where    a  term  that  is  quadratic  in  the  velocity  must  be  added  to  the  viscous  friction
normally employed, and (ii) oscillations that involve sliding or rolling surfaces, where Coulomb's nonlinear
friction must be used; which considers only the algebraic sign of the velocity.  More recently, there have
been considerations for  (iii) the specialized (human-adjustable) types of nonlinear 'damping'  that  derive
from feedback, as in the van der Pol oscillator.  We  will later in this paper demonstrate how both  of  the
nonlinear forms of  fluid and Coulomb damping are frequently present in a single free-decay of a pendulum
(along  with  exponential  damping).    Nonlinear  fluid  damping  is  most  important  early  in  the  decay,  and
Coulomb  damping  is  most important  late  in  the decay.   On  the  other  hand,  exponential  damping  is  most
important in the middle of the decay.  

By  swinging  a  pendulum  in  water,  we  will  also  show  that  the  common  linear  viscous  theory  is
subject to serious misinterpration--by assuming that  the damping  coefficient  is  a  constant  independent  of

fluid  density  and  the  frequency  of  oscillation.    Highlighting  of  this  issue  is  in  large  measure  possible
because of another element of the study, which is described in the  paragraphs which follow. 

The  present  work  is  largely  concerned  with  a  very  important,  but  mostly  unknown,  ubiquitous
form of nonlinear damping.  Following the example of those who were the first to note and to label it as
universal  [1],  the  present  paper  will  formally  refer  to  this  damping  as  the  'universal  internal  friction  of
solids'.   Without the adjective 'universal', this label is analogous for solids to that which was employed for
fluids by the person  who was first to properly describe it [2].  What we call viscous or fluid friction, Sir
Stokes called 'internal friction of fluids'; moreover, what we call 'viscosity', he referred to as the 'index of
friction'.  Why his preferences were lost to history is a curiosity unknown to this author.

  For those engineers who discovered long ago that nature refuses to let them ignore it, the internal
friction of solids has been called  'hysteretic" [3].  It has  even  found  a  prominent  place  in  a  part of    'big
science',  where  it  is  called    'structural  damping'  [4].    The  last  reference  is  to  those  whose  passion  is  to
directly  observe  gravitational  waves  with  an  interferometer.    At  LIGO,  VIRGO,  GEO600,  and  TAMA--
mirrors  hang  from  pendulum  supports--and  if  it  were  possible,    hysteretic  damping  would  be  eliminated
from them; so that thermal noise of their detector would be significantly reduced.  

Studies  by  the  present  author  have  also  uncovered  (at  relatively  low-energies  of  a  pendulum)
features  of  hysteretic-related  damping  that  manifest  themselves  through  discontinuous  jumps  [5].    These
are reminiscent of the Portevin LeChatelier effect, which is likely related to the better known (at least to old
physicists) Barkhausen effect.  The damping in this regime is more properly labeled 'complex' than simply
'nonlinear'.  For systems that dwell in the 'low and slow' (small energy, long period) world of a pendulum,
mesoanelastic complexity can be the basis for bizarre behavior [6].  

Debate  continues  as  to  whether  hysteretic  damping  is  really  linear  or  nonlinear  (since  much
additional  study  is  needed  for  a  definitive  proof).    Engineers  have  usually  chosen  to  include  hysteretic
damping  in  their  models  by  way  of  an  artificial  'equivalent  viscous'  form.      Nevertheless,  because  the
damping can  be understood in terms of secondary creep of the pendulum structure [7];  hysteretic damping
is most naturally cast in nonlinear form [8].  The same nonlinear mathematical form that is well-suited to its
description, will be seen to naturally accommodate, in a single equation, the other commonly encountered
types of oscillator damping. 

A  factor  in  the  linear/nonlinear  controversy  involves  the  shape  of  the  decay  curve--being
exponential for hysteretic damping, the same as viscous damping.  It should be noted, however, and as will
be discussed in detail later; there is a significant difference in the frequency dependence of damping that is
external (viscous), as opposed to internal to the oscillator (hysteretic).   Moreover, it will be seen that the
frequency dependence of linear fluid damping is significantly different from common assumptions.  For a
pendulum  swinging  in  water,  the  Q  variation  with  frequency  was  found  to  depart  radically  from  what  is
usually  assumed.    Perhaps  a  similar  result  is  true  for  motion  in  air,  but  this  would  be  more  difficult  to
demonstrate.

In  the experimental results which follow,  a heuristic 'universal' model of nonlinear damping will
be  presented.      Output  generated  by  a  single  one  of  its  pieces  shows  the  characteristics  of  exponential
'hysteretic'  damping  .    Likewise,  other  individual  pieces  generate  each  of  the  other  common  forms  of
damping:    (i)  exponential  linear,  (ii)  amplitude-dependent  (nonlinear  fluid),  and  (iii)  Coulomb.    For  this
reason, and especially because it readily accommodates the important universal form of damping in solids
(hysteretic),  the  model  is  itself  described  as  universal.    Because  of  its  significant  similarity  to  Coulomb
damping, it is  also frequently  referred to as a 'modified Coulomb' model. 

 

Compound Pendulum Experiment
A  compound  pendulum  was  studied  in  free-decay.    It  is  a  pendulum  supported  by  small,  low-
friction,  precision  ball-bearings  that  define  the  axis  of  rotation;  and  which  were  chosen  to  insure  a
detectable, though minimal amount of  Coulomb friction.   It was essential to this study that the frequency
of oscillation be variable; this was accomplished by adding to the usual lower mass, a position-adjustable
mass located above the axis.

At all times during the decay,  position of the pendulum was determined with a highly linear and
sensitive detector, which provides a measurement that is virtually noninvasive, over a large dynamic range.
Use of the caveat, 'virtual', here draws attention to the fact that a perfect measurement is impossible.  As
discussed later in this article (damping redshift), even 'classical' measurements (in addition to well known
quantum cases) are not always immune to difficulty.   There is at least one example from classical physics
where an attempted meaningful measurement is met instead with a signifcant (state altering) disturbance to

the  system  which  is  the  object  of  the  study.    It  occurs  when  one  tries  to  accurately  measure  electrical
potentials on a set of small capacitors.  Anyone who has tried to do so will quickly acquire admiration for
Michael Faraday.  

In the present studies, although amplitude of motion was small, relative to restoration nonlinearity;
it was nevertheless large enough for nonlinear viscous damping to be visually evident in the early portions
of many records.  A typical free-decay record would thus show apparent evidence for (i)  non-viscous (high
Reynolds number) fluid friction in the early-part, (ii) exponential decline in the mid-part, and (iii) Coulomb
decay in the end-part of the decay. 

The  importance  of  a  given  type  of  damping  will  be  shown  to  depend  on  both  (i)  frequency  of
oscillation,  and  (ii)  time  in  the  free-decay  at  a  given  frequency.    At  higher  frequencies,  where  viscous
friction  is  more  important,  it  was  discovered  that  the  textbook  form  of  viscous  damping  can  lead  to
meaningless  conclusions.    Huge  errors  result  when  one  assumes  the  damping  coefficient  is  a  constant.
Rather (as known to some engineers), it was found that the damping coefficient depends significantly on
the density of the fluid as well as its viscosity (and also the frequency of oscillation).  The dependence on
density and frequency of oscillation, as well as viscosity, is a consequence of harmonic disturbance to the
fluid  by  the  oscillating  pendulum.    The  simple  Stokes  law  form  of  viscous  drag  (to  which  the  proper
friction term reduces in the limit of zero frequency) applies only to steady flow.  

The  study  also  shows  that  hysteretic  damping  is  the  dominant  source  of  dissipation  at    low
frequencies of oscillation, because of structural anelasticity.  Whereas this was already known by the author
to be true for the case of a pendulum swinging in air, the same result was found for motion in water.  It is
doubtful that most would anticipate this surprising result.   

Data Processing
Output from the sensor of the pendulum was converted from analog to digital form and stored in
the computer for analysis.  In every trial, decay of the motion was viewed until such time as noise was of
comparable size to the signal.  It was found that working with signals of abbreviated duration can result in
serious  misinterpretation.    Such  errors  of  judgment  are  no  doubt  a  factor  in  many  false  conclusions  that
appear  to characterize the world of damping science.

Output  from  the  sensor  was  used  to  compare  turning-point  (pendulum  amplitude)  data  against
corresponding model generated numbers produced with a computer.  In the process of refining the method,
the following conclusion was reached.  Just as a full decay record is essential, as noted above; so also, a
proper interpretation of the decay requires a full-nonlinear fit to the data.  The importance of a  full-fit  is
illustrated  in  the  following  confession  by  the  author.    Yielding  to  a  temptation  that  is  probably
commonplace, he tried to estimate the viscous component of damping by restricting attention to the 'tail' of
the  decay  record.      To  focus  on  a    portion  of  the  record  seemed  reasonable,  since  the  early  and  obvious
influence of quadratic-in-the-velocity fluid friction has by then apparently 'died away'.  It was not realized
until later, following proper treatment -- that 'fits to the tail' are highly sensitive to one's choice of  'initial'
condition.    Because  the  starting  value  of  such  a  tail-fit  is  ill-defined,  the  results  led  to  unrealistic
conclusions, which at the time seemed quite reasonable. 

Prerequisites
This study could only be realized because of three high-technology experimental components :  (i)
an  inexpensive,  yet  powerful  personal  computer,  (ii)  an  adequate,  yet  still  user-friendly  analog-to-digital
(A/D) converter with powerful software support, and (iii) a recently developed, superior sensor technology.   

The large number of sample points  necessary for proper evaluation of a decay record makes the
computer  indispensible.    It  is  easy  to  see  why  Stokes'  appeal  (in  1850)  for  more  'decrement  of  the  arc'
measurements  in  support  of  his  theoretical  analyses  --probably  lacked  for  enthusiastic  volunteers.
Practically  speaking,  the  absence  of  any  one  of  the  elements  mentioned  above  would  have  caused  the
present study to be impossible.  

 FLUID  FRICTION  THEORY

In  his  seminal  1850  paper  [2],  Sir  George  Gabriel  Stokes  introduced  his  now  famous  law  of
viscous  damping.    Among  other  firsts,  the  theory  of  Stokes  showed  why  raindrops  in  clouds  are  able  to
persist--since the force of the air acting on a drop depends on the radius of the small water sphere, rather
than on its surface area.  His insight corrected an error in the 'common theory' which had prevailed to that

point in time.      It  is noteworthy  that  this foundational work  centered on one  of  the oldest  instruments  of
experimental science, the pendulum.  

Discussed in nearly every textbook of physics, the simple form of Stokes law of  friction force f is

written

which  involves  the  radius  a  of  the  sphere,  moving  at  constant  speed  v,  in  an  incompressible  fluid  of
viscosity η .   Curiously, Stokes coined an alternative expression-- 'index of friction'--why it is obscure in
the history of physics is surprising and unknown to the author.   

Few  recognize  that  the  steady  flow  expression  (Eq.  1)  is  inadequate  when  the  sphere  executes
harmonic  motion.    For  the  harmonic  cases  of  present  interest,  a  'history  term'  must  be  added  to  Eq.  1  to
yield

Thus,  in  addition  to  the  viscosity,  the harmonic  viscous  friction  force  involves  the  'penetration  depth'   δ;
which itself depends on the angular frequency ω of oscillation, and the density ρ of the fluid [9].  Through
comparisons of  theory  and  experiment,  a  validation of Eq. 2  is  later provided.    Probably  as  a  surprise  to
most,  it  will  be  shown  that  commonly  encountered  cases    yield  a  δ  that  is  smaller  than  a  by  roughly  an
order  of  magnitude.    In  other  words,  viscous  harmonic  friction  can  be  much  greater  than  steady  flow
viscous friction !  When this is the case, the retarding force is proportional to the area of the sphere rather
than being proportional to its radius.  

The simplest equation to approximate the free-decay of most oscillators is the following famous

where the damping term has been written in 'canonical' form by means of the quality factor Q.  For systems
with  fairly  small  damping,  Q  is  defined  as  2πE/|∆Ε|,  where  E  is  the  energy  of  oscillation  and  ∆Ε is  the
energy lost per cycle because of dissipation.  More commonly,  the dissipation  is  expressed  in  terms  of  a
damping coefficient β, where

Although the damping coefficient is oftentimes called a damping 'constant', it will be later shown, using Eq.
2, that this coefficient involves the density of the fluid and the frequency of oscillation.

In textbooks, a subscript 0 is usually associated with ω in Eq. 3, because of the damping 'redshift'
inherent  to  its  mathematical  solution.    For  the  present  (and  possibly  every)  situation,  the  subscript  is
deemed  unnecesary for the reasons that follow.   

To his knowledge, the author alone has seriously treated the difficulty of measuring the damping

shift,  which is conveniently expressed in terms of the Q as

( 6 )

The effect does not even exist to begin with, in the case of  hysteretic damping (discussed later), and it is
too small to permit experimental validation--except, perhaps, through the employment of Herculean efforts.
Consider, for example, the smallest Q encountered in  the present  experiments,  having  the value of  about
10.  According to Eq. 6, the magnitude of the expected shift, in this largest of all the cases studied, is only
0.125 %.   Such a small change in frequency for a short-duration signal is difficult to measure by either of
two methods that were attempted by the author with students, using the experiment that is next described.  
In lieu of a pendulum, where control of the damping parameter is difficult, an RLC oscillator in
free-decay was studied, using  fixed L and C, and a variable resistance R.  Individual decay records were
captured with a Tektronix digital oscilloscope and then exported to Microsoft Excel for detailed analysis.
The experiment yielded the following conclusions.  

(i) Use of  spectral measurement techniques (involving the fast Fourier transform, or FFT) do not
work for reason of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  As resistance is increased to enlarge the effect,
'lifetime' shortening of the waveform becomes a serious detriment; i.e., concomitant linewidth broadening
disallows the shift to be resolved.    

(ii) Use of  computer fits to the data prove no better, for reason of noise associated with bandwidth
features of the oscilloscope.  Reducing the lifetime of the signal requires an increase in the bandwidth of
the  recording  instrument,  lest  the  signal  become  distorted.    The  concomitant  increase  in  Johnson  noise
becomes detrimental to this measurement.  This limitation became evident in the noise-reduced quality of
residuals-- difference between data and a theory-generated best-fit to the data.

The Pendulum--where Linear Approximations are insufficient

Eq.  3  is  attractive  because  of  its  simplicity;  it  is  especially  simple  as  here  presented,  where
attention  to  the  inconsequential  damping  redshift  has  been  omitted.    Because  it  is  a  linear  equation,  it
cannot  be  used  to  describe  a  host  of  increasingly  important  phenomena,  some  of  which  can  be  studied
meaningfully  with  the  pendulum  [10].    The  present  work  demonstrates  that  nonlinearity  is  important  not
only to pendulum restoration, but also to pendulum damping.   Whereas pendulum damping of nonlinear
viscous type is fairly well known,  other important nonlinear types are not.  

Large -amplitude  Pendulum

The driven, rigid simple pendulum with linear damping has become an archetype of chaos [11].

where I is the moment of inertia, and ∆ is the distance of the center of mass from the axis.  The restoration
is seen to be nonlinear, because of the sine term.  It is necessary for chaos.  The damping term is linear,
being  proportional  to  the  angular  velocity.    For  the  case  of  Mercer's  online  chaotic  pendulum,  this  is  a
reasonable  approximation,  because  most  of  its  damping  derives  from  eddy  currents  of  an  aluminum  disc
that is connected to the pendulum, and which moves between magnets. 

Small-Amplitude Pendulum in Free-decay

Unlike  pendulum  motion-past-vertical,  which  is  necessary  for  chaos;  all  present  experiments    involved
amplitudes  sufficiently  small  that  sin  θ may  be  replaced  by  θ    in  Eq.  7.    (We  will  see  that  the  elastic
nonlinearity  remains  observable  (using  residuals)  for  motion  at  some  of  these  lower  levels;  but  its
magnitude  is  not  consequential,  as  compared  to  damping  nonlinearity.)  Additionally,  the  pendulum  was
studied in free-decay, so that τ d  of Eq. 7 is zero, and the equation in turn reduces to the equivalent of Eq. 3.  

Heuristic Universal form of Pendulum (Mechanical Oscillator) Damping

What has been discovered through present and previous experiments by the author, is that Eq. 3 is
rarely an adequate description of pendulum motion, even at amplitudes where concerns for isochronism is
not an issue.  To correct the observed deficiencies, the following nonlinear equation was developed.

Through  a  large  number  of    tests,  involving  various  types  of  pendula  with  differing  dissipation
types,  the  efficacy  of  the  following  equation  has  been  demonstrated  (c.f.,  reference  8).      Later  in  this
document, the usefulness of Eq. 8 for deciphering experimental observations will be further illustrated with
some examples.

Of the four damping terms in Eq. 8, the last one is traditional (linear) viscous, and the three inside
the  brackets  are  nonlinear  because  of  the  signum  (sgn)  function  which  operates  on  the  velocity.
Respectively,  from  left  to  right,  the  bracketed  terms  model  friction  of  the  type  that  is:    (i)  Coulomb,  (ii)
hysteretic, and (iii) amplitude dependent (or 'fluidic').   As presented, both the hysteretic damping and the
amplitude  dependent  damping  can  be  justifiably  labeled  with  the  generic  term,  'modified  Coulomb'
damping.    They  may  be  thought  of  as  a  friction  force  where  the  'coefficient'    is  energy  dependent,  as
opposed  to  being  the  kinetic  constant  used  to  treat  contacting  surfaces  where  there  is  relative,  sliding
motion.

It is important to note that only  hysteretic damping and viscous damping are characterized by a
constant  Q.    Also,  in  the  case  of    amplitude-dependent  damping  of  Eq.  8--  although  it  may  be  called
'fluidic',  because  of    similarity  to  nonlinear  fluid  damping;  the  terminology  can  be  misleading.    Fluid
viscosity  has  no  physical  basis  for  those  cases  where  the  dissipation  involves  the  rearrangement  of
crystalline defects in the structure of the solid.  

 It is also worthy of note that each of the bracketed parts can be written as a force per unit mass, in

terms of the energy as

where  c  is  a  constant.    For  Coulomb  damping  λ  =  0,  for  hysteretic  damping  λ  =  1/2,  and  for  fluidic
damping  λ  =  1.    Some  yet-to-be  discovered  damping  type  may  take  advantage  of  an  altogether  different
value of λ.

It is also seen from Eq. 9 that the friction can be expressed in terms of a square wave velocity, [v],
which  corresponds  to  the  fundamental  component  of  a  Fourier  series  expansion  of  the  oscillator's  actual
velocity.    (For  a  square  wave  +h,  the  amplitude  of  the  fundamental  is  +(4/π)h.)    We  thus  see  that  all
damping  which  involves  harmonic  oscillation,  when  expressed  in  canonical  form,  is  of  the  form  f  =
mωv/Q.    The  simplicity  of  this  result  is  probably  why  viscous  damping  has  been  viewed  by  so  many  as
'inviolate'.  One must exercise care, however, because only for the case of hysteretic and viscous damping
is  Q  constant.    If  we  designate  the  amplitude  of  the  motion  by  y,  and  indicate    initial  values  with  the
subscript 0; then for amplitude-dependent damping Qf = Qf 0(y0/y).  For Coulomb damping Qc = Qc 0(y/ y0).
Thus the Q of hysteretic damping increases with time, whereas the Q of Coulomb damping decreases wtih
time.

This equivalence to the manner in which capacitors in series combine should not be surprising; the smallest
Q of the system  is most important to the energy loss.

The  primary  difference  between  hysteretic  and  viscous  damping  involves  their  frequency

dependence.  It is not difficult to show from Eq. 8, that for hysteretic damping

   ω∝hQ

(hysteretic)

It is popularly and erroneously believed that the  Q of viscous damping is always proportional to the first
power of the frequency.   This would be true if the damping coefficient were constant, which it is not.  In
the water-damping results which follow, it was found that the exponent was different according to which
configuration of the pendulum was used

The low frequency configuration used a pair of weights on the pendulum rod--one above, as well as below
the axis of the pendulum; whereas the low-frequency configuration used only the lower weight.

Eq.  11  illustrates  a  confusion  factor  associated  with  the  common  method  for  specifying  internal
friction;  i.e.,  as  1/Q.      The  quality  factor  of  an  oscillator  formally  has  meaning  only  as  it  is  presently
defined.    The  Q  involves  more  than  just  the  'loss  tangent'  associated  with  stress-strain  hysteresis;  its
frequency  variation  also  involves  restoration  properties  of  the  oscillator.    Although  many  experimenters
choose to designate their measured loss tangent by 1/Q, the practice is misleading.  The resulting confusion
for hysteretic damping of a pendulum is discussed in detail in [12]. 

The  functional  form  of  Eq.  10  is  especially  significant  to  two  modern  experiments:    (i)  torsion
pendulum measurements of  Newton's universal gravitational constant, G [c.f., 13], and (ii) LIGO's search
for gravitational waves, in which a given mirror of the interferometer is supported as a high Q pendulum.
In  [4]  one reads  the  following  statement:    "The  quality  factor (Q) of  the IP  is  compatible  with  structural
damping.  Q is proportional to the square of the pendulum frequency". 

Basis for Curve Fits

For purpose of computer generated curves to compare theory with experiment,  it is necessary to
obtain a mathematical representation, consistent with Eq. 8, for the turning points of the pendulum.  Such
an expression is generated from the time dependence of pendulum energy [8]:

where  each  of  the  C  's  is  a  constant.    Both  hysteretic  and  viscous  damping.are  accommodated  by  the

dependent damping that might be present ( high Reynolds number cases, or some types of internal friction
in solids ).  Superposition of the energy parts is used in writing Eq. 12, even though nonlinear mathematics
does not in general permit it.

Eq.  12  provides  the  first  order  differential  equation  for  the  turning  points  (corresponding  to
maximum displacement = amplitude y), by recognizing that energy is proportional to  y2.   Thus, Eq. 12

EXPERIMENTAL  APPARATUS

The pendulum used in these studies is pictured in Fig. 1. As noted earlier, bearings were purposely
selected, instead of a knife edge for the pendulum axis, to provide minimal Coulomb friction, in addition to
other types of damping normally active in the pendulum.  The pair of ball-bearings (System Management
Associates,  Inc,  Box  957,  Palo  Alto  94302,  part  No.  628)  are  located  in  the  arms  of  a  y-shaped  plastic
housing that is mounted with a bolt to the gear-moveable platform (via the knurled knob), which rides on
the support post of square cross-section.  (For present experiments, this geared degree of freedom was not
needed). 

Figure  1.    Compound  pendulum  showing  five  different  masses  that  could  be  used  in  a  variety  of
configurations.  

In addition to the dark-colored ping-pong ball and the cue-ball resting on the floor, three other masses are
present in the picture, mounted on the rod.  At the bottom of the rod is a nearly spherical lead mass  which
can be attached and detached with a screw.  At the top is a detachable light-weight, large-diameter hollow
metal ball; and between this pair is a lead weight (711 g) whose position can be changed by means of its
wing-nut clamp.   Not all the objects shown in the figure were used in the data presently described.

The hollow rod which holds the masses was once a lightweight aluminum alloy arrow, whose total
mass with additional components is now 44.4 g, and whose length is 77 cm.  The fletching and end-nocking
plastic pieces were cut away from the arrow, and it was squeezed flat using a vise, in a central region about
10 cm long, except for a small section at the geometric center.  At this center, a through-hole was drilled to
accommodate  the  small  brass  pin,  whose  ends  are  located  (operationally)  in  the  inner  race  of  the  ball
bearings.  After assembly, this pin was glued in place to the rod.  

A semicircular piece of single-sided printed circuit board was also epoxied to the flatted portion of
the  rod  to  serve  as  the  moving  electrode  of  the  sensor.    To  strengthen  the  hollow  rod  at  the  transition
between its circular and flat regions, epoxy was added.  To insure an equipotential throughout the moving
electrode that comprises PCB and flatted section of the arrow, paint was scraped from the arrow and silver
paint was added to insure electrical contact between the arrow and the copper of the board.  

Sensor

The  photograph  of  the  pendulum  in  Fig.  2    is  a  closeup  which  focuses  on  the  symmetric

differential capacitive (SDC) sensor and its electronics support [14].  

Figure 2. Closeup of the sensor and its support electronics.

Clearly visible in Fig. 2 is one of the pair of static electrodes of the sensor, which are positioned
on  opposite  sides  of  the  rotating  electrode.    These  are  not  the  full  circle  type  that  would  permit  angle
measurement of + π/2; since the plastic part which holds the pair of ball-bearings disallows motion larger
than about +0.7 rad.

On the side of the post opposite the sheet copper electrodes, and supported by a single small screw
at its upper left, is the circuit board (dim. 4.5 cm x 9 cm) on which are installed electronic components used
by  the  sensor.    These  include  a  quad-opamp  and  NE5521N  integrated  circuit  chips.  The  banana  plugs
through which electrical power is supplied to the board from a power supply (not shown) are visible in Fig.
1. 

Seen also with the sensor in Fig. 2 is a Dataq DI154-RS analog-to-digital converter.  Being limited
to  12-bit  resolution,  this  converter  was  replaced  for  present  experiments  with  a  16-bit  unit  (not  shown,
Dataq's DI-700) that operates through the USB of the computer.    

Also not shown in the figures is the tall nylon shroud that was used to shield the instrument from
air currents when operating at long periods, where the sensitivity is great.  This shroud was fabricated from
two barrels, one of which had both ends removed using a skil-saw.  The 2nd, half-length barrel sits on top
of  the  open-end  cylinder;  which  itself    surrounds  the  pendulum,  which  during  operation,  sat  on  a  sturdy
laboratory table. 

Sensor Calibration Results
Sensor linearity is a requirement of great importance for work of present type.  Shown in Fig. 3
are the results of calibration (small displacement data), which clearly demonstrate that the requirement was
met for the range considered by the figure.  Although the sensor was crudely constructed, its linearity was
found to be excellent over the full range of displacements considered in the study.  The precision data of
Fig. 3 were obtained with a digital vernier caliper.  Although it was not possible to calibrate the sensor with
this great a precision at angles beyond those of the figure, the indicated 3.85 V/rad is stated with confidence
for all data taken.

Figure 3.  Sample calibration results for the capacitive sensor.  The detector's response was determined
to be constant at 3.85 V/rad over + 0.6 rad (larger than the range of the figure by an order of magnitude).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Benchmark of Internal Friction -- Low Frequency Motion in Air

Even Stokes recognized that internal friction of the pendulum could not be ignored, and he talks
about the matter in his 1850 paper [2].  For the simple pendulum, internal friction will not  be as significant
as  for  a  compound  pendulum  like  the  present  instrument.      An  attempt  to  'benchmark'  the  hysteretic
component    is  important  for  the  identification  of  damping  types  (similar,  in  principle,  to  determining
background in nuclear experiments).  

Numerous  investigations  by  the  author  and  by  others  have  shown  that  internal  friction  of
hysteretic type is the dominant source of dissipation in any long-period mechanical oscillator.  A seminal

paper  might  have  prevented  this  important  fact  from  having  to  be  rediscovered--had  the  1927  work  of
Kimball and Lovell become better known [1].   The frequency dependence of pendulum Q for hysteretic
damping  (noted in Eq. 10 ) is consistent with the 1927 discovery.  

Kimball and Lovell used neither a pendulum nor any other type of oscillator for their work; rather
they devised a clever technique which measured the transverse deflection of a rod.  When hysteresis due to
anelasticity  is  present,  a  rotating  rod  will  experience,  in  addition  to  the  primary  deflection  which  results
from an end-applied bending force--an additional deflection that is transverse to the first.   In showing that
the resulting transverse deflection was independent of the rate of rotation (and thus frequency), they were
first  to  determine  that  the  internal  friction  of  solids  is  functionally  different  from  the  internal  friction  of
fluids.   Stokes was the first to properly describe the internal friction of fluids 77 years earlier.  Kimball and
Lovell  chose  to  label  the  damping  they  had  discovered  as    'universal'  to  solids,  and  their  claim  has  been
substantiated  by  recent  experiments.    Perhaps  this  choice  caused  them  to  be  perceived  by  their  peers  as
arrogant,  so  that  the  paper  was  poorly  received.    Whatever  the  cause,  their  work  did  not  receive  the
prominence that it deserves, until the 1990's.  

Shown  in  Fig.  4  are  the  present  benchmark  results,  which  are  seen  to  be  in  agreement  with
hysteretic (internal friction) damping theory, as evidenced by the straight line of Q versus the square of the
frequency.  As noted earlier, one is not forced to assume a nonlinear damping model, to obtain agreement
of the type provided by the figure.  An equivalent viscous damping model would also suffice, where one
artifically divides the usual viscous damping coefficient by ω.  To do so is questionable, however; since its
physical basis is unjustified.  By contrast, the proper frequency dependence is automatic with Eq. 8.  

Figure 4.  Illustration of hysteretic damping of the pendulum, for oscillation at low-frequency in air. 

For the data of Fig. 4, the pendulum was swung with two masses--the pair shown mounted on the
pendulum  in  Fig.  1,  but  with  the  large  hollow  sphere  removed.    The  highest  frequency  included  in  the
figure  corresponds  to  a  period  of  approximately  2  s.    This  is  a  shorter  period  than  would  normally  still
correspond so strongly to internal friction damping--except that here the pendulum rod is relatively weak
for  the  size  of  weights  employed  (and  thus  deflects  significantly).      If  the  rod  were  more  rigid,  viscous
damping would already have shown its presence, once the period had been adjusted downward from 15 s
toward  2 s. 

Even  a  simple  rod  pendulum,  constructed  of  malleable  metal,  can  also  be  configured  to  exhibit
damping  of  the  Fig.  4  type,  as  shown  in  reference  10.    Deviations  from  the  smooth  decay  curves  of  the
present study are also possible, when working with a ductile metal.  Similar bizarre behavior is encountered
when one studies pendulum motion at very small amplitudes, in the realm of mesoanelastic complexity [5].

Oscillation in Water

For these experiments, a wooden sphere (dia 3.79 cm, mass 35.8 g with screw) was attached to the
bottom of the pendulum rod with a 10-32 screw that had been reduced in a lathe to a small diameter for the
portion that moves in water.  A rectangular plastic container (11 cm  x 23 cm  x 5 cm) was placed and filled
with enough water for the sphere to remain completely submerged in its motion along the direction of the
long  axis  of  the  container.    Physical  constraints  disallowed  the  path  of  the  motion  to  be  centered  with
respect to the 11 cm dimension; rather the sphere was offset by 1.5 cm.  

The bottom lead sphere pictured in Fig. 1 had been replaced for these measurements with another
lead weight (993 g) that could be clamped (like the upper lead weight) at any position on the rod below the
axis.    This  change  was  made  so  that  a  smooth  progression  in  frequency,  from  low  to  high,  could  be
accomplished by adjusting both weights. 

Estimating the influence of theViscous Damping Coefficient δ

To estimate the damping coefficient δ, Equations 2 and 3 were first combined (after rewriting  in
the  form  appropriate  to  a  pendulum).    This  gives  the  following  equation  for  the  Q  of  oscillation,  as
determined solely by linear viscous damping.  (We will later discuss the manner in which the viscous part
can be extracted from a full nonlinear fit to the data.)

Here L = 45.2 cm (distance from axis to center of sphere of radius a = 1.90 cm), and I is the moment of
inertia.  Governed by the position of the weights on the rod (same being true of the center of mass); there is
a unique moment for each of the fifteen frequencies that were considered in the water study.  The value of I
for  a  given  ω was  determined  by  both  (i)  direct  computation  using  measured  distances  for  the  known
weight masses, and (ii) indirect theoretical estimation, accounting for water influence on frequency through
the effects of 'buoyancy' and 'added mass' [9].  Reasonable self-consistency was found for the two methods.
Fig. 5 shows the importance to the calculation of buoyancy and added mass, whose influence on frequency
is large because of the large density of water.

Figure  5.    Theoretical  estimate  for  the  influence  on  pendulum  frequency  (period  lengthening)  due  to
buoyancy and added mass of the water.
 
The dramatic importance of the history term a/δ of Eq. 16 is illustrated in Fig. 6.  To assume simple Stokes
law viscous damping  (which applies only at zero frequency) is to underestimate the damping by 1000 to
3000 %.

without correction.  The curves of Log Q (base 10) are for the two frequency branches considered in the
study.  

Decay Records

Of  the  fifteen  decay  records  of  the  water  study,  a  typical  one  is  provided  in  Fig.  7;  where  the
displayed ordinate is in terms of sensor output voltage.  With the sensor calibration constant of 3.85 V/rad,
it is recognized that the initial amplitude of the motion for this decay was 68 mrad.  

Figure 7.  Typical free-decay record showing the influence of nonlinear damping. 

The figure  was  generated  by  'copy  and  paste'  from  Excel  to  Paint,  after  the  nonlinear  curve  fit  had  been
managed  in  Excel.    The  A/D  converter  data  had  been  originally  stored  in  Dataq's  software  package,
windaq32.exe.  From there it was saved in spreadsheet (*.csv) format for export to the Excel spreadsheet. 

Spreadsheet  generation  of  the  fit  was  accomplished  by  'eyeball'  optimization,  through  trial  and
error adjustment of the three parameters a, b and c.  This proved user friendly and powerful for Pentium II
and later computers, only because of the 'autofill' function.  By changing a number at the last row (bottom)
of entries, and autofilling upward to the top, the effect of any change can be immediately assessed  at the
instant the graph is refreshed on the monitor.  The process slows down with larger data sets, but some of
the  present  cases  involved  32K  voltage  values;  which  is  the  maximum  file  size  for  graphing  in  Excel.
[Caution:    autofilling  downward  can  experience  a  'sensitive  dependence  on  initial  conditions'--the
generation of blank rows at a rate which approaches infinity! ] 

Estimating the Viscous (linear) contribution to the Damping 

In Fig. 8 we see the dissipation history of the decay record of Fig. 7.

Figure 8.  Illustration of  Fig. 7's time-dependent dissipation, due to nonlinear damping.

The influence of the nonlinear damping (through parameters a and c) is readily evident in Fig. 8.  In the
early part of the decay, loss is greater than exponential (due to non-zero a), causing the Q to increase from
below 40 toward the maximum of about 120.  If there were no Coulomb damping (bearings that support the
pendulum), the Q would limit at the value of 136 (obtained by setting c = 0 in the spreadsheet algorithm).  
The method just described is the only dependable means known to the author for estimating the
exponential (constant Q) contribution to the damping.  As was noted earlier, attempts to 'fit to the tail' of
the decay are fraught with subtle difficulties of non-reproducibility, even if there were not an obvious and
ultimate Coulomb fall-off, as in the present case.

It  should  be  noted  that  the  limiting  Q  (136)  is  not  necessarily  viscous-only  damping,  since
hysteretic damping also gives an exponential (constant Q) decay.  To compare present results with Eq. 16,
requires  a  correction  to  the  raw  data,  due  to  its  internal  friction  (hysteretic)  component.    The  hysteretic
component had been determined earlier; i.e., Q hys = 3940 f 2 (refer to Fig. 4).   Thus,

Using  Eq.  17,  we  thus  adjust  the  measured  Q  upward  to  yield  our  estimate  for  the  viscous  Q  at  the
frequency of 0.516 Hz ; i.e., 156.  From Eq. 16, for the moment of inertia appropriate to 0.516 Hz ( I = .099
kg m2   ), we obtain a value that is 13 % larger, at 176.   This is evidently a systematic error of unknown
origin (using for the viscosity of water 1.0016 mPa s and for the density 1000.0 kg/m3) , since most of the
15 measurement results are smaller by roughly this amount.

Shown in Fig. 9 are the comparions with theory for all 15 cases.  Here, rather than correcting the
measurements  upward  to  compare  with  theory,  we  have  instead  elected,  in  Fig.  9,  to  correct  Eq.  16
downward to compare directly to the experimental values.

Figure  9.  Comparison  of  theory  against  experiment.  The  solid  curves  of  theory  were  generated  by
combining with Eq. 16 the Hysteretic influence detailed in the data of Fig. 4.

In generating the experimental data of Fig. 9, only the exponential (limiting) Q's were considered.
Following nonlinear curve fits to each of the decay records, this limit was obtained by setting parameters
and c of the fit to zero (in Eq. 15 ).  The limit corresponds to a combination of low-level (linear) viscous
damping  and  hysteretic  (internal  friction)  damping.    The  latter  is  more  important  in  the  low-frequency
branch of Fig. 9.  

To  ignore  the  hysteretic  damping  in  the  lower  branch  of  Fig.  9  is  to  overestimate  the  Q

substantially, as seen in Fig. 10.

lower frequencies (red curves).    

CONCLUSIONS

The  present  work,  plus  the  independent  investigation  of  others,  provides  strong  evidence  for  a
broadly important form of internal friction damping that has been ignored for decades following the earliest
scientific evidence for its existence.  Failure for its recognition probably derives from the fact that its most
common  embodiment  is  cause  for  exponential  decay,  just  like  linear  viscous  damping.    Yet  in  the
celebrated  work  of  George  Gabriel  Stokes,  written  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century,  there  are  tell-tale
indicators  of  its  presence.    Most  important  is  the  little-known  1927  paper  which  made  claims  for  this
universal  form  of  damping  in  solids,  that  is  not  consistent  with  the  physics  of  fluid  friction.    In  spite  of
these  strong  early  indicators,  only  since  the  1990's  has  this  universal  form  of  damping  been  seriously
studied.

 The methods of pedagogical physics appear to have been a factor  in our  oversight.   From  their
textbooks, students are led to believe that external-to-the-oscillator (viscous) friction is the most important
(if not only) mechanism responsible for energy loss of an oscillator.  To make matters worse, the textbook
treatment  of  damping  is  not  even  adequate  to  the  treatment  of  harmonic  fluid  friction.    There  is  undue
attention to what may be a non-measurable attribute of the theory provided; and students can be easily led
to  believe  that  the  viscous  damping  coefficient  is  a  constant,  involving  only  the  viscosity  of  the  fluid.
Although many cases of damping can be adequately described by a coefficient multiplying the velocity, it
is not permissible to treat this coefficient as being independent of either (i) the frequency, or (ii) the density
of the fluid in which the oscillation occurs. 

Deterministic  chaos  took  on  meaning,  only  after  our  obsession  with  linear  elasticity  was
abandoned;  so  likewise,  it  is  felt  that  additional  important  discoveries  await  the  elimination  of  our
obsession with linear damping.

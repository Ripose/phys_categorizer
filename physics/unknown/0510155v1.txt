ABSTRACT 

Some  basic  properties  of  nonradiating  systems  are  considered.  A  simple  connection  is  established  between  the 
existence  of  residual  electromagnetic  potentials  and  the  current  density  spectrum  of  the  system.  The  properties  of 
specific  configurations  based  on  toroidal  and  supertoroidal  currents  are  modeled  with  the  finite-difference  time-
domain method. Possible applications are discussed. A design of a new type of nonradiating system, based on a left-
handed metamaterial is proposed and the system performance is modeled numerically.  

Keywords: Nonradiating configurations, Toroids, Supertoroids, Finite-difference time-domain method, FDTD 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Nonradiating configurations are oscillating charge-current distributions that do not produce electromagnetic fields in 
the  radiation  zone.  Such  structures  were  initially  considered  in  atomic  physics  [1,  2].  More  recently,  nonradiating 
configurations  have  been  studied  in  connection  with  inverse-source  problems  [3-6]  and  the  electrodynamics  of 
toroidal and supertoroidal currents [7-9]. Nonradiating systems are of interest also in other branches of wave theory 
and physics (see e.g. [10, 11]).

current density 
later  shown  [12],  this  condition  is  not  necessary.  The  results  of  [12]  indicate  that  another  condition,  namely

,  is  a  necessary  and  sufficient  one.  The  latter  condition  only  requires  the  absence  of  the  Fourier 
components  that  are  transverse  to  r,  as  opposed  to  the  absence  of  both  the  transverse  and  the  longitudinal

An important conclusion that can be drawn from the earlier results is that two types of nonradiating systems can

exist.  The  first  type  satisfies  the  condition 
  and  examples  of  such  systems  exist  [1,  7].  A 
characteristic feature of these structures is that both the electromagnetic fields and the electromagnetic potentials are 
zero.

It is pointed out [1] that the case 

 corresponds to simple spherically symmetric oscillations of the 
charge  density.  However,  non-trivial  systems  that  satisfy  this  can  be  created  using  toroidal  structures.  It  has  been 
shown  [7,  8]  that  a  non-radiating  configuration  can  be  constructed  by  combining  infinitesimal  toroidal  or 
supertoroidal  solenoids  with  electric  or  magnetic  dipoles  placed  in  their  center.  The  calculations  performed  in  [7] 
and  [8]  show  that while  the electromagnetic  fields  disappear outside  such  a  composite  object,  the  electromagnetic

An  important  question  concerning  the  non-radiating  systems  is  what  kind  of  applications  these  systems  might 
have. The absence of radiation is, in fact, ensured by a specific relationship between the parameters of the system 
and  those of  the  ambient  environment.  Variation of  the value of  any of  these parameters  will  cause  the  system  to 
radiate.  In  principle  system  that  does  not  radiate  under  certain  conditions  could  be  employed  to  measure  the 
parameters of the ambient environment. The present work addresses this question.  

2. CONDITIONS FOR ABSENCE OF RADIATION AND ABSENCE OF 
ELECTROMAGNETIC POTENTIALS 

Following some guidelines, set out by earlier works [1, 12], the conditions ensuring the absence of radiation from a 
charge-current distribution are derived in this section. The difference between absence of an electromagnetic field 
and absence of electromagnetic potential will be emphasized.

Equations (4) and (5) clearly show that the charge-current configuration considered would emit no electromagnetic 
energy if the condition  

is satisfied. Equation (6) is a sufficient condition for absence of radiation [1]. It is clear that systems satisfying (6) 
produce no electromagnetic fields and no electromagnetic potentials. It can easily be shown, however, that (6) is not 
a necessary condition. Assuming monochromatic time dependence reduces (4) to

From  (6),  (11)  and  (12)  it  is  clear  that  for  a  system  satisfying  (6)  both  the  electromagnetic  fields  and  the 
electromagnetic  potentials  are  zero.  In  contrast,  a  configuration  satisfying  the  weaker  condition  (11)  radiates  no 
electromagnetic energy but the electromagnetic potentials are finite. These potentials are given by (12) and (5).  

3. TOROIDAL AND SUPERTOROIDAL DIPOLE MOMENTS 

The toroidal (dipole) moments are easy to see as a generalization of the usual magnetic (dipole) moment. A rigorous 
approach to the problem is given in [7-9, 14].  

Consider a wire loop of radius d carrying a current of strength I (Fig. 1a). A magnetic dipole moment  m  can be 

assigned to this loop according to the definition [13]

0T  stands for toroidal moment of zeroth order and  n  is a vector of unit length perpendicular to the plane of 
In (13) 
the loop. The current loop can be seen as a circular arrangement of current elements 
. Now if each current 
element is formally replaced with a magnetic dipole moment, a circular arrangement of dipole moments, known as a 
first-order toroidal moment, will be obtained (Fig 1b). The corresponding definition is [14]

Replacing the current elements with magnetic dipole moments corresponds to constructing a toroidal solenoid with 
its  windings  wound  along  the  meridians  of  a  toroidal  surface.  The  latter  is  shown  in  Fig.  2  in  some  more  detail.

Pursuing the same idea a step further, each of the windings of the toroidal solenoid can in turn be replaced with a 
toroidal solenoid (Fig. 1c). The resulting structure is a circular arrangement of (first-order) toroidal moments and it is 
known  as  second-order  supertoroid  [7-9].  The  quantity  characterizing  this  structure  is  the  second-order  toroidal 
dipole moment given by 

Note that  dI in (13) has been replaced with  dm  to obtain (14), which in turn has been replaced by 
(17). Using the notation of Fig. 1c

In (18) N is the number of windings in each first-order toroidal solenoid and the quantity

The same procedure can be applied once again and each first-order toroidal solenoid can be replaced by a second-

order one. This will result in a third-order supertoroid and so on.  

4. NONRADIATING CONFIGURATIONS BASED ON INFINITESIMAL TOROIDAL 
AND SUPERTOROIDAL CURRENTS 

The nonradiating configurations considered in this section are known from the literature [7, 8]. Here we propose 
a  specific  application  for  such  systems,  namely  the  possibility  of  measuring  the  permittivity  of  dielectric  media. 
Then  we  give  an  interpretation  of  the  ability  of  some  configurations  to  generate  finite  time-dependent 
electromagnetic  potentials  in  the  absence  of  electromagnetic  fields  in  terms  of  the  general  criteria  for  absence  of 
radiation. These criteria have already been discussed in section 2.  

Consider  a  first-order  toroidal  solenoid  with  N  windings  carrying  a  current  of  strength  I  Fig.  2.  The  current

is the relative dielectric pemittivity of the medium in which the electromagnetic fields of the electric dipole and the 
first-order toroidal solenoid compensate each other. As (28) shows the value of  ε~  can be controlled by varying the 
ratio between the amplitudes of the currents flowing in the electrical dipole and the toroidal solenoid. This suggests 
that  it  should  be  possible  to  measure  the  relative  dielectric  permittivities  of  media  (e.g.  liquids)  by  adjusting

experimentally  the  ratio  of  the  currents  flowing  in  the  dipole  and  the  toroidal  solenoid  until  a  zero  of  the  emitted 
power is detected. The relative dielectric constant of the material under investigation can then be determined from 
(28).  

To illustrate this point further, consider a second-order toroidal solenoid coaxial with a magnetic dipole [8]. The 

current density associated with this object is

As (36) shows, a combination of a magnetic dipole and a second-order toroidal solenoid satisfies the condition (6). 
As  discussed  in  section  2,  both  the  electromagnetic  potentials  and  the  electromagnetic  fields  are  zero  for  such  a 
system.  According  to  (35)  however,  a  nonradiating  configuration  built  from  a  first-order  toroidal  solenoid  and  an 
electric  dipole  satisfies  the  weaker  condition  (11).  Such  systems  produce  finite  electromagnetic  potentials,  in  the

5. NUMERICAL MODELING OF TOROIDAL RADIATORS 

Although analytical formulae do exist for the electromagnetic fields of a toroidal solenoid [9], numerical evaluation 
. An approximations-free approach to the problem, based 
of the latter is not straightforward beyond the limit 
on  an  exact  numerical  solution  of  the  Maxwell’s  equations  is  therefore  useful,  especially  in  the  presence  of 
inhomogeneities [15].

Since by definition the toroids are bodies of revolution (BOR), a special implementation of the finite-difference 
time-domain  method  (FDTD),  known  as  BOR-FDTD  [16]  is  well-suited  to  the  problem.  The  method  takes 
advantage of the azimuthal symmetry that reduces the problem to a two-dimensional one. Maxwell’s equations are 
solved in the ρ-z plane with the actual three-dimensional current distribution replaced by its cross-section with the ρ-
z plane (Fig 3). The three-dimensional distribution of the electromagnetic fields is then restored by rotating the two-
dimensional solution around the z-axis.

result is obtained in the limit D<<λ with T2 given by (19).  

For  a  first-order  toroidal  solenoid  this  cross-section  is  a  circle,  shown  in  Fig.  3a,  confining  the  azimuthal 
magnetization  (21).  The  cross-section  of  a  second-order  toroidal  solenoid  with  the  ρ-z  plane  is  a  ring  of 
magnetization,  Fig  3b.  The  lines  of  the  magnetization  are  circles  coaxial  with  the  ring.  Away  from  the  center  the 
modulus of the magnetization vector decreases as the inverse of the radius of the circle. As Fig. 4a and 4c show the 
radiation patterns of small (d<<λ) toroidal solenoids are dipole-like. In contrast, if their size is comparable with the 
wavelength (see Fig. 4b) the higher-order toroidal multipoles become important and the radiation pattern develops 
multiple peaks.

6. ON THE EQUIVALENCE OF THE RADIATION PATTERNS OF SUPERTOROIDS 
AND DIPOLES IN THE PRESENCE OF AN INTERFACE BETWEEN TWO 
DIELECTRIC MATERIALS 

The  fact  that  the  radiation  pattern  of  an  infinitesimal  supetoroidal  solenoid  is  identical  to  that  of  a  dipole  in  a 
homogeneous material is known (see e.g. [8], [14] and the references therein). In what follows we show that this is 
also the case in the presence of a planar interface separating two different dielectric materials.  

Consider an infinitesimal second order toroidal solenoid coaxial with a magnetic dipole both located at the origin 
of a cylindrical system of coordinates (see Fig. 5). The dielectric permittivity of the material is equal to ε for z>d0 
and to ε1 for 

z <

.  

0d

The problem of a dipole radiating near the interface between two media with different dielectric properties was 
first investigated by A. Sommerfeld in 1909 [17]. Since then it has become a subject of a strong research interest (see 
e.g. [17-19]).  

The electromagnetic wave in the region z>0 (Fig. 5) propagates in the positive z-direction. It has two components: a 
primary wave, originating at the source and a wave reflected by the interface. In the region d0<z<0 the field contains 
an upward-propagating (+z) reflected component and a primary component propagating along –z. In the region z<d0 
the transmitted wave propagates along –z. The electromagnetic field is presented in the form of a superposition of 
cylindrical waves with identical radial wavenumbers in both the materials. 

The solution is [19]

Equation (42) shows that the radiation patterns of an infinitesimal supertoroid and a magnetic dipole are identical in 
the presence of an interface. In other words, if the compensation condition 
, obtained in a homogeneous 
material with dielectric permittivity  ε from (30) is satisfied, the presence of the interface will not cause the system 
to radiate. In the presence of the interface the second-order supertoroid is equivalent to a magnetic dipole with the 
magnitude of its dipole moment given by

In [15] the emission properties of a first-order toroidal solenoid, electric dipole and their combination have been 
studied  and  compared.  As  Fig.  6a  shows,  although  the  size  of  both  the  toroid  and  the  dipole  is  finite,  reasonable 
agreement with the analytical result (27) has been obtained at 1GHz in a homogeneous medium. Fig 6b shows that 
the  radiation  patterns of  the electric  dipole  and  the  first order  toroidal solenoid  are  identical  in  the presence of  an 
interface, as (42) implies. Their combination, however, still emits power while according to (42) it should not. The 
residual radiation can be attributed to the leading-order uncompensated multipole moment (not taken into account in 
(42))  of  the  structure.  This  multipole  is  unimportant  when  the  toroid  and  the  dipole  are  acting  alone,  because  its 
magnitude is much lower than that of the dipole moments. However, when the net dipole moment of the system is 
  is  satisfied)  the  next-order  multipole  moment  of  the  system  becomes 
zero  (the  compensation  condition 
important. Indeed, the radiation pattern of a combination of a toroid and dipole is not dipole-like, as Fig 6b suggests. 
Its dependence on the dielectric perimittivity of the substrate material is also much stronger compared to that of a 
toroid or a dipole acting alone. Fig. 6c shows the distribution of the magnetic field for a combination of a first-order 
toroidal  solenoid  and  an  electric  dipole.  In  this  case  the  interface  between  the  two  media  coincides  with  the 
equatorial  plane  of  the  toroid.  Because  neither  of  the  two  media  contains  the  entire  system,  the  same  line  of 
considerations,  which  led  us  to  (42),  is  not  applicable  to  this  case.  The  problem  nevertheless  can  be  solved 
numerically.

7. NONRADIATING CONFIGURATIONS DRIVEN BY LEFT-HANDED 
METAMATERIALS 

The nonradiaitng systems are, in fact, sources that do not produce fields outside their own volume [6, 11]. The non-
propagating fields that exist inside such a source might be useful for applications such as sensors – disturbing the 
configuration  of  these  fields  will  generate  radiation.  It  is  clear  however  that  systems  capable  of  generating  non-
propagating fields inside an arbitrary large (on a wavelength scale) volumes are needed. The combinations of toroids 
and dipoles discussed so far do not posses this property. They only work in the limit

Figure 7.  Two identical first-order toroids driven by π-out-of-phase currents at 1GHz in the focal planes of a “perfect” lens – 
a  disc  made  of  a  left-handed  metamaterial  (a).  Gray-scale  map  of  the  azimuthal  magnetic  field  component  created  by  the 
toroids in the absence of the lens is shown in (b). The corresponding result in the presence of the lens – (c). The currents in (b) 
and (c) are identical but the power emitted by the system in the absence of the lens is about 20 times higher. Identical scale is 
used  to  produce  the  graphs  (b)  and  (c).  White  and  black  colors  mean  large  positive  and  negative  values  of  the  field, 
respectively, while regions where the absolute value of the field is close to zero are represented with grey tones. The ratio 
between the collision frequency in the Drude model and the excitation frequency is 0.01. The lens radius is four wavelengths 
and the distance between the two emitters – 2.6 wavelengths.  

Fig. 7a shows a couple of toroidal solenoids driven by π-out-of-phase currents in the focal planes of a disc made of a 
left-handed  metamaterial  (LHM).  It  has  been  shown  (see  e.g.  [20-25])  that  a  slab  of  such  a  material  has  the 
properties of an aberrations-free lens, capable of providing resolution below the diffraction limit. It is easy to show 
that the interaction of the image of the first emitter with the second emitter and vice-versa limits the power emitted 
by the system. As a result of this interaction, the electromagnetic field remains confined between the two emitters 
and the LHM disc. To verify this, we have studied numerically the system depicted on Fig. 7a. The Drude model is 
used for both the permittivity and permeability of the lens. Details on FDTD modeling of left-handed metamaterials 
are given in [22, 23].  

Fig. 7 shows a comparison between the fields generated by the same current system (two toroidal solenoids): in 
the presence of the lens (c) and in its absence (b). As this comparison shows, the lens limits strongly the amount of 
power radiated by the system: by a factor of 20 in the case presented in Fig. 7. Strong non-propagating fields are 
generated in the regions between each of the emitters and the lens. The amount of residual emitted power strongly 
depends of the parameter values such as collision frequency, size of the lens, distance between the emitters, etc. The 
fact  that  one  and  same  current  distribution  radiates  different  amounts  of  power  (Fig  7b  and  Fig.  7c)  is  not  a 

 

10

contradiction with the energy conservation law. It can be shown that the power input from the generator, driving the 
currents in the two emitters, always equals the sum of the power dissipated in the volume of the lens and the radiated 
power.  By  properly  choosing  the  system  parameters  the  latter  can  be  minimized.  The  details  will  be  given  in  a 
separate  paper.  It  should  be  noted  however  that  the  toroids  are  not  the  only  type  of  emitters  that  can  work  in  the 
nonradiating system of Fig. 7a. Qualitatively the same results are expected with any two identical radiators.  

In conclusion nonradiating systems based on toroidal and supertoroidal currents are studied. The general criteria 
for absence of radiation known from the literature are applied to these systems and a simple connection is established 
between  the  current  density  spectrum  and  the  uncompensated  electromagnetic  potentials.  It  is  shown  that  the 
radiation patterns of an infinitesimal supertoroid and a dipole are identical in the presence of an inhomogeneity in the 
form of a planar interface between two dielectric media. Design of a new type of non-radiating system based on left-
handed metamaterial is suggested.

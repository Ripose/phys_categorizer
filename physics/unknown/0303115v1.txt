ABSTRACT 

To gain insight into the electronic properties of PrFe4P12 filled skutterudite, band electronic 

structure calculations, Total and Projected Density of States, Crystal Orbital Overlap Population 

and Mulliken Population Analysis were performed. The energy bands yield a semi metallic 

behavior with a direct gap (at Γ) of 0.02 eV. Total and Projected Density of States provided 

information of the contribution from each orbital of each atom to the total Density of States. 

Moreover, the bonding strength between some atoms within the unit cell was obtained. Mulliken 

Population Analysis suggests ionic behavior for this filled skutterudite. 

Keywords: Electronic properties, thermoelectric materials, superconductivity.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

 Filled ternary skutterudites1 are a family of compounds with general structural formula RT4X12 

(where  R  =  alkaline  earth, rare earth, actinide; T = Fe, Ru, Os; X = pnictogen:  P, As, Sb) and 

crystallize1,2  in  the  cubic  skutterudite  structure  (space  group  Im3).    A  variety  of  interesting 

physical  properties  such  as  superconductivity3,4,  magnetic  order5,  small  hybridization  gap 

semiconductivity  (also  known  as  "Kondo  insulator"  behavior)6,  valence  fluctuation  and  heavy 

fermion behavior7-10, non-Fermi liquid behavior 11, and metal-insulator transition12.  

Recently,  these  compounds  attracted  renewed  attention  due  to  their  potential  application  as 

thermoelectric materials (TE)13-14. TE performance is characterized by a dimensionless figure of 

merit.  ZT  =  σS2T/κ,  where  σ  is  the  electric  conductivity,  S  is  the  thermopower,  and  κ  is  the 

thermal conductivity; ZT up to 1.4 at 600 K has been measured in skutterudites. 

Recently, YbFe4Sb12, the first filled skutterudite compound based on a rare earth element heavier 

than Eu, was synthesized10,15. 

In  order  to  get  insight  into  the  extraordinary  properties  of  the  filled  skutterudite  compounds; 

electronic structure calculations on PrFe4P12 were performed. 

The organization of this work is as follows: Sec. II computational details of the calculations. The 

results  and  discussion  of  the  electronic  properties  are  presented in Sec. III.  Finally,  in  Sec. IV, 

we present the conclusion of this work.

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS 

   The  calculations  reported  in  this  work  had  been  carried  out  by  means  of  the  tight-binding 

method16 within the extended Huckel17 framework using YAeHMOP18 computer package with f 

2 

orbitals19.  More details about the mathematical formulation of this method had been describe20 

elsewhere and are omitted here. 

   The structure of PrFe4P12 used in the present work is illustrated in Fig. 1 from Leithe-Jasper et 

al.15 large spheres represents Pr, medium size spheres depicts Fe and smaller spheres represents P 

atoms  respectively.  It  is  characterized  by  the  space  group:  Im-3-Th

5  No.  204,  Z=2,  and  with 

primitive vector a = 0.7771 nm, V = 0.7679 nm3, with one Pr atom located in the position (2a) 0 

0  0,  and  four  Fe  atoms  located  at  (8c)  1/4  1/4  1/4,    3/4  3/4  1/4,  3/4  1/4  3/4,  1/4  3/4  1/4;  and 

twelve P atoms located at (24g) 0 y z, 0 -y z, 0 y -z, 0 -y -z, z 0 y, z 0 -y, -z 0 y, -z 0 -y, y z 0, -y 

z 0, y -z 0, - y -z 0, with y = 0.1593 and z = 0.3365 of π/a. The atomic parameters employed in 

our calculations are summarized in Table I. 

In order to facilitate the analysis in PrFe4P12, it is well known that the unit cell for this compound 

could be decomposed into (Fe4P12)3- sub units21, while Pr has a valence of 3+, making the unit 

cell neutral. Hence, the skutterudite structure is formed by six P4 rings around each Fe atom and 

can be described by a cube. The center of the cube contains a Fe atom, and each face of a cube 

contains a quarter of one P4 ring, with the center of the P4 ring located at each cube corner, thus, 

six  different  P4  rings  provide  the  octahedral  coordination  of  Fe.  The  body-center  unit  for 

PrFe4P12 is constructed by assembling eight such cubes. 

III.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

A.  Electronic Properties 

    The  band  structure  of  the  filled  skutterudites  under  study  was  calculated  using  51  K  points 

sampling  the  First  Brillouin  Zone  (FBZ)  as  shown  in  Figs.  2  (a)  to  (b).  Fig.  2  (a)  yield  an 

indication  of  the  Valence  band  (VB)  and  the  Conduction  band  (CB);  the  Fermi  level  (Ef)  is 

 

3 

indicated by a horizontal dotted line. The inset in Fig. 2 depicts the Wigner-Seitz cell for a Base 

Center Cubic (BCC) configuration spanning from Γ (0 0 0) to H (0 π/2a 0) to N (π/4a π/4a 0) to 

Γ  (  0  0  0  )  to  P  (π/4a  π/4a  π/4a)  which  generates  the  first  Brillouin  zone  (FBZ).  The  most 

important features in the dispersion diagram for PrFe4P12 is a tendency to form a pseudo gap that 

appears  above  the  Fermi  level  (see  Fig.  2  (b)),  which  is  a  characteristic  of  skutterudites, 

especially  when  a  single  phosphorous  p-band  crosses  the  Fermi  level.  The  crossing  band  is 

indeed pushed down by the repulsion of Pr f-resonance states.  

In order to study more closely the bands around the Fermi level, these bands have been reploted 

on an expanded energy scale in Fig. 2 (b). A direct mini gap measured at Γ, between the highest 

and  two  horizontal  lines  indicate  lowest  bands  in  the  VB  and  CB.  The  Eg obtained was of the 

order of 0.02 eV. 

Performing a more careful analysis to the two bands in the vicinity of the Fermi level, see Fig. 2 

(b), these two bands form a hybridize band. Note at Γ, the highest occupied band forming the VB 

has  a  parabolic  shape,  which  implies  a  regular  effective  mass,  on  the  other  hand,  the  lowest 

unoccupied band from the CB has a more pronounced shape, implying an effective mass bigger 

than  the  former  one.  The  combination  of  these  two  bands,  with  different  effective  mass  in  the 

vicinity of the Fermi level, is what provides the utility of PrFe4P12 as a thermoelectric material. 

Summarizes in Table II are the values obtained for the energy gap (Eg)(direct and indirect), the 

VB and CB for the ternary skutterudites LaFe4P12, CeFe4Sb12, CeFe4P12 and YbFe4Sb12, as well 

as  values  derived  from  other  methods  of  calculation  and  from  the  experiment  for  each 

compound, when available. 

 

4 

   For  the  ternary  skutterudites,  Nordstrom  et  al.22  performed  a  density  functional  calculation 

within  the  local-density  approximation  (LDA)  obtaining  indirect  gaps  in  CeFe4P12  and 

CeFe4Sb12,  of  0.37  and  0.10  eV  respectively,  while  Dordevic  et  al.23  reported  an  experimental 

gap of 15 meV. 

   Jung et al.21 using extended Huckel tight-binding method calculated the value gap of 2.7 eV for 

the indirect gap of LaFe4P12. While Fornari et al.24 performed calculations within the framework 

of  the  density  functional  theory  using  the  general  potential  linearized  augumented  plane  wave 

(LAPW) method and obtained 98 meV for an indirect gap measured at Γ. 

On  the  other  hand,  Meisner  et  al.25  found  for  LaFe4P12  a  metallic  behavior  using  transport 

measurements, also found superconductivity behavior with a transition temperature of 4.2 K. 

Galvan  et  al.26  using  tight-binding  method  within  the  Extended  Huckel  framework  using 

YAeHMOP  computer  package  with  f-orbital  for  Yb  (U  or  Th),  reported  no  evidence  for  the 

existence of a mini gap in YbFe4Sb12, UFe4P12 and ThFe4P12 respectively. 

 Our calculations for PrFe4P12 yield a mini gap of the order of 0.02 eV, as shown in Fig. 2(b).  

Furthermore,  it  is  good  to  underline,  that  only  a  single  band  from  the  VB  crosses  the  Fermi 

energy.  This  behavior  has  been  observed  in  filled  skutterudites,  implying  the  semi  metallic 

character  of  this  compound.  The  difference  obtained  between  the  experimental  values  and  the 

presence of a mini gap in our calculation is a good indication that this compound could be used 

as  an  effective  thermoelectric  material.  On  the  other  hand,  the  absence  of  a  mini  gap  in 

YbFe4Sb12,  UFe4P12  and  ThFe4P12  reported  by  our  group26  could  be  attributed  to  the  omission 

from our calculations of either electronic correlations or spin-orbit coupling, which are necessary 

in these kinds of materials where many electrons are involved. 

 

5 

Unfortunately,  up today no experimental and theoretical data are available in order  to  compare 

with. 

  For the width of the VB and CB, we obtained the values 9.35 and 29.37 eV, respectively. 

B.  Density of States 

   The  total  and  projected  density  of  states  (PDOS)  for  the  filled  skutterudite  PrFe4P12  are 

depicted in  Figs. 3  (a) - (g) for Pr (f, d, p and s orbital), Fe (d, p and s orbital) and P (p and s 

orbital). For Pr the p and s orbital were not included in the energy window because they did not 

contribute appreciably. In these figures, energy in eV (vertical axis) is plotted vs % contribution 

(horizontal axis); the solid line represents the total DOS, while the dotted and hatched lines are 

the selected projected DOS for each orbital. The horizontal dotted line indicates the Fermi level 

Ef.  It  is  good  to  stress  that  each  orbital  of  each  atom had  been projected  separately in order to 

find  the  contributions  attributed  from  each  atom  to  the  total  DOS  in  the  specific  energy  range 

selected. 

occurred. 

One of the most important properties about this compound is the possibility of TE applications in 

industry. Henceforth, we analyze the orbital in the vicinity of the Fermi level, from -9.5 to -12.2 

eV. The main contributions to this band are from Pr f-orbital (50 %), Fe d-orbital (2.5 %) and P 

p-orbital (3 %). Also, notice that the Fermi levels is located almost at the middle of Pr f-orbital, 

an  indication  that  hybridization  between  this  orbital  with  Fe  d-  orbital  and  P  p-orbital  had 

Dordevic et al.23 claim similar results in YbFe4P12, while Galvan et al.26 obtained similar results 

in YbFe4Sb12, UFe4P12 and ThFe4P12. 

 

6 

   In order to provide more information related to the hybridization occurred between Pr f-orbital, 

Fe d-orbital and P p-orbital, Table III is provided. This table provides the amount of overlap (in 

%)  of  the  respective  orbital  from  Fe  and  P  with  Pr  f-orbital.  Note  that  Fe  d,  and  p  orbital 

contributes with 8 and 1 % respectively, while P p-orbital contributes 3 %.  It is good to point out 

that  these  overlap  of  several  orbitals  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Fermi  level  yield  the  expected 

hybridization as occurred in other ternary skutterudites. 

   What kind of information is provided from the location of Pr f-orbital whether they are located 

above, in between or bellow the Fermi level? 

   From our experience obtained while performing similar calculations on the filled skutterudites 

such as YbFe4Sb12, UFe4P12 and ThFe4P12 and performing a careful analysis on Tables III, notice 

that the aforementioned hybridization between Pr f-orbitals with Fe d, p orbitals and P p-orbitals, 

the values obtained are not very big, implying that the hybridization occurred is not very strong, 

which provides an indication that PrFe4P12 is a mild semi metallic compound.  

From  the  thermoelectric  point  of  view,  the  contribution from each atom  to  the hybridize band, 

the stronger the contribution to the band the more likely that the compound under study could be 

considered a likely candidate as a TE material. 

C.  Crystal Orbital Overlap Population (COOP) 
 

In order to obtain information about bonding between some atoms in the unitary cell, Crystal 

Overlap Population Analysis (COOP) were performed. The integral of the COOP curves 

provides the total overlap population, which is not identical to the bond order, but scales like it 

27.

the magnitude of the coupling overlap, and the size of the coefficients in the molecular orbital 

under consideration. 

orbital to each band is provided. 

Energy in eV vs positive (bonding) or negative (antibonding) contributions (in %) from each 

In order to perform the analysis, the following atoms were selected: Pr17-Fe1 (3.4092 A), Pr17-P5 

(3.4092 A), Fe1-P5 (2.5609 A), Fe3-Fe4 (6.4750 A) and P5-P6 (2.9175 A). The number in 

parentheses provides the distance in between the selected atoms. Notice that depending on the 

selected atoms, the corresponding bonding or antibonding and also the magnitude of the overlap 

are provided. An indication of the strength on the specific bond between atoms is provided which 

depends on the distance in between atoms and the electronegativity of each individual 

D.  Mulliken Population Analysis 

Mulliken population analysis is defined indices to quantitatively locate electronic charge around 

an atom, and its bonding or anti bonding nature28. 

As we mentioned in Sec. II, the sub unit (Fe4P12)3- (pnictogen four member ring), Fe is an 

octahedral coordination with P. Hence, the orbitals that contribute to form the hybridize band in 

the vicinity of the Fermi level are Fe d-orbital. These five orbitals separate into t2g (dxy, dxz, dyz) 

and eg (dx2-y2, dz2) symmetric bands. Due to the crystal field splitting, being t2g block band lower 

in energy than eg block band, hence it is expected that these orbital will electronically be filled in 

that order. 

 

8 

In this research, the d-orbitals are filled in the following order dyz (1.917), dxy (1.909), dxz 

(1.908), dz2 (1.878) and dx2-y2 (1.856). The number in parenthesis provides the electronic 

occupation being 2 the maximum number of electrons in a single orbital. 

In P the orbitals that are filled first are s-orbitals (1.235) and then pz (1.044), px (1.04) and last py 

(0.872). Notice that both orbitals are more than half-filled. 

Furthermore, Pr f-orbitals are filled as follows: fyz2

 (1.385), fxyz (1.328), fz3 (1.315). These 

orbitals are more than half-filled. The rest of the f-orbitals are filled in the subsequent order: fxz2, 

fz(x2-y2), fx(x2-3y2) and fy(3x2-y2). These orbitals are less than half-filled. 

The fact that some of these orbitals are completely filled, and some other are more than half-

filled, provides indication that a none uniform charge distribution (polarization) exist between 

some atoms in the unit cell. From this analysis, it is possible to infer that some kind of ionic 

behavior exist in PrFe4P12. 

IV.  CONCLUSIONS 

   The following conclusions can be drawn from the calculations described herein for PrFe4P12: 

-  The  energy  bands  indicate  that  this  compound  is  a  semi  metal,  with  a  clear  distinction 

between  CB  and  VB.  A  direct  gap  measured  at  Γ  yield  0.02  eV,  while  Dordevic  et  al.29 

-  The character of the bands was identified as s, p, and d and f electrons for Pr, s, p and d for 

obtained 13 meV for YbFe4Sb12. 

Fe, and s, p for P respectively. 

-  The important features of a likely pseudogap created by the P p-orbital that crosses the Fermi 

level  with  the  interaction  of  Pr  f-resonance  states  provide  indication  that  this  material  is  a 

likely candidate for TE applications. 

 

9 

-  From  the  total  and  projected  DOS,  it  was  possible  to  identify  the  contributions  from  each 

orbital from each atom, in PrFe4P12. 

-  The  band  from  -  9.5  to  -12.2  eV,  is  mainly  formed  from  the  contributions  from  Pr  f-

resonance  states  with  an  admixture  of  small  contributions  of  P  p-orbital  and  Fe  d-orbital. 

Moreover, hybridization occurs within this band due to the overlap of Fe d and p orbital, P p 

orbital with Pr f-orbital, as summarized in Table IV. This hybridization is consistent with the 

predictions of Dordevic et al.29 in YbFe4Sb12. 

A  similar  feature  has  been  reported in heavy fermion compounds such as URu2Si2

  where a 

partial gap forms at the Fermi surface in association with a spin-density wave ground state30. 

-  The  COOP  analysis  provided  information  related  to  the  bonding  strength  between  some 

selected atoms within the unit cell and their character (bonding or antibonding). 

-  Mulliken population analysis yield information related to the ionic behavior in PrFe4P12.

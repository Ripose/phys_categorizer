Abstract

Given an irrational number α and a positive integer m, the distinct frac-
tional parts of α, 2α, · · · , mα determine a partition of the interval [0, 1].

lengths, respectively, of the subintervals of the partition correspond-

max(m) and ∆α

ing to the integer m, it is shown that the sequence,

bounded if and only if α is of constant type. (The proof of this assertion
is based on the continued fraction expansion of irrational numbers.) In
the investigation of certain dynamical systems, this result is essential

1 Introduction

Let α be a real irrational number, and α − [α] = {α} be the fractional part of
α (where [·] is the greatest integer function). For k = 1, 2, · · · , m, consider the
sequence of distinct points {kα} in [0, 1], arranged in increasing order:

0 < {k1α} < · · · < {kjα} < {kj+1α} < · · · < {kmα} < 1

max(m) and ∆α

where 1 ≤ kj ≤ m for j = 1, 2, · · · , m.
Let ∆α
min(m) denote, respectively, the maximum and minimum
lengths of the subintervals determined by the above partition of [0, 1]. Using
the continued fraction expansion of α [see Section 3], we obtain a new charac-
terization of irrational numbers of constant type (deﬁned as irrationals with
bounded partial quotients). We show, in Theorem 3 [see Section 4, The

Main Theorem], that the sequence

∆α

α is an irrational number of constant type.

is bounded if and only if

Other characterizations of an irrational number of constant type can be found
in the survey article by J. Shallit [1]. In the investigation of certain dynamical
systems, Theorem 3 is essential for the formulation of stability criteria for
orbits of so called quantum twist maps [2].

This paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 contain the relevant deﬁni-
tions and basic facts about continued fraction representation of real numbers.
Then, in Section 4, we will establish several theorems and propositions leading
to Theorem 3.

2 Notation and Deﬁnitions

Throughout this paper, N, Z, Q, R denote the natural numbers, integers,
rational numbers, and real numbers, respectively. For x ∈ R, the greatest
integer function, denoted by [x], is the unique integer satisfying [x] ≤ x <
[x] + 1. [x] has the following property [3]:

[x] + [−x] =

0

if x 6∈ Z

Deﬁnition 1. The “fractional part” of x ∈ R is deﬁned by {x} := x − [x] (so

that 0 ≤ {x} < 1).

Remark 1. It follows from Deﬁnition 1 that

if x 6∈ Z

(i) {kα} > 0 ∀k ∈ Z\ {0}
(ii) For k, l ∈ Z, k 6= l if and only if {kα} 6= {lα}

Lemma 1. Let x, y ∈ R. If {y} ≤ {x}, then {x} − {y} = {x − y}.

Proof. It follows from 0 ≤ {y} ≤ {x} < 1 that

0 ≤ {x} − {y} = (x − y) − ([x] − [y]) < 1

Hence, [x] − [y] ≤ (x − y) < ([x] − [y]) + 1, and by deﬁnition, [x − y] ≤
(x − y) < [x − y] + 1. By uniqueness of [x − y], [x] − [y] = [x − y]. Thus,
{x} − {y} = {x − y}.

Note: Lemma 1 will be crucial for most of the proofs in this paper.

Deﬁnition 2. For x ∈ R, the distance between x and the nearest integer is
✷
deﬁned by kxk := min({x}, 1 − {x})

Remark 2. From Deﬁnition 2, we observe that

(a) 0 ≤ kxk ≤ 1/2 and kxk = k − xk for all x ∈ R

(b) For x ∈ R \ Z, kxk = min({x}, {−x}), by Remark 1(a), and hence,

kxk ≤ {±x}.

(c) For x ∈ R, 0 ≤ {x} ≤ 1/2 if and only if {x} = kxk

3 Basic Properties of Continued Fractions

Throughout this section, α denotes an irrational number. Proofs of the fol-
lowing facts can be found in references [4,5].

Fact 1. α ∈ R \ Q if and only if α has inﬁnite (simple) continued fraction
expansion:

α = [a0; a1, a2, · · · , an, · · ·] = a0 +

1
a1 + 1
a2+

...

4

where a0 ∈ Z and an ∈ N for n ≥ 1.

Deﬁne integers pn and qn by:

p0 = a0
q0 = 1

; p1 = a0a1 + 1 ; pn = anpn−1 + pn−2
; qn = anqn−1 + qn−2
; q1 = a1

, n ≥ 2
, n ≥ 2

Then, it follows that gcd(pn, qn) = 1, and 0 < q1 < q2 < · · · < qn < qn+1 < · · ·
✷

Note:

pn
qn (cid:19)n≥0

are called principal convergents to α.

Deﬁnition 3. An irrational number, α, is of constant type provided there
✷
exists a positive number, B(α), such that B(α) = supn≥1 an < ∞.

Fact 2. For even n,

form a strictly increasing sequence converging to

α. For odd n,

form a strictly decreasing sequence converging to α.

Furthermore,

Remark 3. From Fact 1 and Fact 2, we observe that:

(a) 0 < |qnα − pn| < 1 for n = 0, 1, 2, · · ·

(b) If n is even, (qnα − pn) > 0 and if n is odd, (qnα − pn) < 0. Hence,
|qnα − pn| = {qnα} for n even, and |qnα − pn| = {−qnα} for n odd. More
compactly, |qnα − pn| = {(−1)nqnα}.

(b) kqnαk < kqn−1αk

4 The Main Theorem

For α ∈ R \ Q and m ∈ N, the numbers {α}, {2α}, . . . , {mα} are distinct
elements of (0, 1), by Remark 1(b). We arrange these numbers in increasing
order:

0 < {k1α} < · · · < {kjα} < {kj+1α} < · · · < {kmα} < 1

(∗)

where the distinct integers kj ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , m}. The sequence (∗) determines
a partition of [0, 1] given by

P α(m) = h0, {k1α}, . . . , {kjα}, {kj+1α}, . . . , {kmα}, 1i

Remark 4. For the partition, P α(m), of [0, 1]:

(a) The lengths of the subintervals (0, {k1α}) and ({kmα}, 1) are, respec-

tively, {k1α} and 1 − {kmα} = {−kmα}, by Remark 1(a).

(b) For j = 1, 2, . . . , m − 1, the length of the subinterval ({kjα}, {kj+1α}) is

{kj+1α} − {kjα} = {(kj+1 − kj)α}, by Lemma 1.

(c) For j = 1, 2, . . . , m − 1, we have 1 ≤ |kj+1 − kj| < m.

The maximum and minimum lengths of the subintervals of P α(m) are denoted,
respectively, by

∆α
∆α

max(m)
min(m)

:= max [{k1α}, {(kj+1 − kj)α}, {−kmα}]
:= min [{k1α}, {(kj+1 − kj)α}, {−kmα}]

where j = 1, · · · , m − 1.

Lemma 2. Let n ≥ 1 and qn ≤ m < qn+1, where qn is the denominator of the
nth principal convergent to α ∈ R \ Q. Then, for n even, {qnα} = {k1α}, and
for n odd, {qnα} = {kmα}, where {k1α}, {kmα} ∈ P α(m).

Proof. For 1 ≤ r < qn+1, kqnαk ≤ krαk ≤ {±rα}, by Fact 4 and Remark
2(b).
For n even:
By Remark 3(b),(d), kqnαk = {(−1)nqnα} = {qnα}, which implies that {qnα} ≤
{rα} for r = 1, 2, · · · , qn, qn + 1, · · · , m (where qn ≤ m < qn+1). Hence,
{qnα} = {k1α} in the above partition of [0, 1].
For n odd:

By Remark 3(b),(d), kqnαk = {−qnα}, which implies that {−qnα} ≤ {−rα} if
1 ≤ r < qn+1. By Remark 1(a), {qnα} ≥ {rα} for r = 1, 2, · · · , qn, qn +1, · · · , m
(where qn ≤ m < qn+1). Hence, {qnα} = {kmα} in the above partition of
[0, 1].

6

Corollary 1. For n ≥ 2, the partition

P α(qn) = h0, {k1α}, . . . , {kjα}, . . . , {kqnα}, 1i

yields the following inequalities: For r = 1, 2, . . . , qn

(a) {qn−1α} ≤ {rα} ≤ {qnα} when n is odd

(b) {qnα} ≤ {rα} ≤ {qn−1α} when n is even

Proof. For n odd:
Setting m = qn in Lemma 2, we have, {rα} ≤ {qnα} for r = 1, 2, . . . , qn.
Also, {qn−1α} = kqn−1αk ≤ krαk ≤ {±rα}, where 1 ≤ r < qn, from Fact 4
and Remark 2(b). Hence, {qn−1α} ≤ {rα} ≤ {qnα} for r = 1, 2, . . . , qn.
The proof of the corollary is completed by a similar consideration when n is
✷
even.

Theorem 1. Let α ∈ R\Q. For n ≥ 1 and qn ≤ m < qn+1, ∆α
where qn is the denominator of the nth principal convergent to α.

min(m) = kqnαk,

Proof. For n even:
∆α
min(m) := min [{k1α}, {(kj+1 − kj)α}, {−kmα}], where j = 1, 2, . . . , m − 1.
Since 1 ≤ km, |kj+1 − kj| ≤ m < qn+1, and, by Lemma 2, kqnαk = {qnα} =
{k1α}, we have, by Fact 4, {k1α} ≤ {(kj+1 − kj)α} and {k1α} ≤ {−kmα}.
Hence, ∆α
Similarly, for n odd, one can show ∆α
(for qn ≤ m < qn+1).

min(m) = {−kmα} = {−qnα} = kqnαk

min(m) = kqnαk for qn ≤ m < qn+1.

Lemma 3. Let α ∈ R \ Q. Suppose 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ qn (mi ∈ N), and {m1α} −
{m2α} = kqn−1αk. Then there is no q ∈ N such that {m1α} > {qα} > {m2α}
and 1 ≤ q ≤ qn.

Proof. Suppose {m1α} − {m2α} = kqn−1αk where 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ qn. Suppose,
also, that {m1α} > {qα} > {m2α} for some q, where 1 ≤ q ≤ qn. Then,
using Lemma 1 and Remark 2(b), k(|m1 − q|)αk ≤ {(m1 − q)α} < {(m1 −
m2)α} = kqn−1αk. This leads to a contradiction, since 1 ≤ |m1 − q| < qn and
k(|m1 − q|)αk ≥ kqn−1αk, by Fact 4.

Proposition 1. Let α ∈ R \ Q and n ≥ 2. Then, for the partition P α(qn) of
[0, 1], there are (qn − qn−1 + 1) subintervals of length kqn−1αk. These subinter-
vals are (0, {qn−1α}) and ({rα}, {(qn−1 + r)α}) when n is odd, or ({qn−1α}, 1)
and ({(qn−1 + r)α}, {rα}) when n is even, where r = 1, 2, · · · , (qn − qn−1).

7

Proof. For n odd:

(a) Since n − 1 is even, by Corollary 1, we have kqn−1αk = {qn−1α} ≤ {rα}
for 1 ≤ r ≤ qn. This implies that kqn−1αk = {qn−1α} = {k1α} and the
subinterval (0, {qn−1α}) has length kqn−1αk.
(b) Consider the intervals ({lα}, {kα}) ⊂ [0, 1], where {lα}, {kα} ∈ P α(qn),
1 ≤ k ≤ qn, and, by Corollary 1, 1 ≤ l < qn. Then,
{kα} − {lα} = kqn−1αk = {qn−1α}
⇔ {kα} − {qn−1α} = {lα}
⇔ {(k − qn−1)α} = {lα} (by Corollary 1 and Lemma 1)
⇔ 1 ≤ (k − qn−1) = l < qn (by Remark 1(b)(ii))
⇔ the ordered pair (k, l) = (qn−1 + 1, 1), (qn−1 + 2, 2), . . . , (qn, qn − qn−1)
The (qn − qn−1) intervals ({lα}, {(qn−1 + l)α}) with length kqn−1αk = {qn−1α}
are also the subintervals of P α(qn), by Lemma 3.
Thus, from (a) and (b), there are (qn − qn−1 + 1) intervals with length kqn−1αk.

The proof of the proposition is completed by a similar consideration when
n is even.

Lemma 4. Let α ∈ R \ Q. Suppose 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ qn (mi ∈ N), and {m1α} −
{m2α} = kqn−1k + kqnk. Then there is no q ∈ N such that {m1α} > {qα} >
{m2α} and 1 ≤ q ≤ qn.

Proof. Suppose {m1α} − {m2α} = kqnαk + kqn−1αk where 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ qn.
Suppose, also, that there exists a q such that 1 ≤ q ≤ qn and {m1α} > {qα} >
{m2α}. Then, using Lemma 1, {(m1 −q)α}+{(q−m2)α} = kqnαk+kqn−1αk.
However, by Fact 4, {(m1 − q)α} ≥ kqn−1αk and {(q − m2)α} ≥ kqn−1αk,
since 1 ≤ |m1 − q|, |q − m2| < qn. Therefore, {(m1 − q)α} + {(q − m2)α} ≥
kqn−1αk + kqn−1αk > kqn−1αk + kqnαk since kqn−1αk > kqnαk. This leads to
a contradiction.

Proposition 2. Let α ∈ R \ Q and n ≥ 2. Then, for the partition, P α(qn),
of [0, 1], there are (qn−1 − 1) subintervals of length kqnαk + kqn−1αk. These
subintervals are of the type ({(qn − qn−1 + r)α}, {rα}) when n is odd, or
({rα}, {(qn − qn−1 + r)α}) when n is even, where r = 1, 2, · · · , (qn−1 − 1).

Proof. For n odd: kqnαk + kqn−1αk = {−qnα} + {qn−1α}, by Remark 3. Now,
consider the intervals ({lα}, {kα}) ⊂ [0, 1], where {lα}, {kα} ∈ P α(qn), 1 ≤
k ≤ qn, and, by Corollary 1, 1 ≤ l < qn. Then,
{kα} − {lα} = {−qnα} + {qn−1α}

⇔ {kα} − {qn−1α} = 1 − ({qnα} − {lα})
⇔ {(k − qn−1)α} = 1 − {(qn − l)α} = {(l − qn)α}

(by Corollary 1, Lemma 1, and Remark 1(a))

8

⇔ k − qn−1 = l − qn (by Remark 1(b))
⇔ 1 ≤ k + (qn − qn−1) = l < qn
⇔ (k, l) = (1, 1 + (qn − qn−1)), (2, 2 + (qn − qn−1)), . . . , (qn−1 − 1, qn − 1)
for the ordered pair (k, l). The (qn−1 − 1) intervals ({(qn − qn−1 + k)α}, {kα})
with length (kqnαk+kqn−1αk) are also the subintervals of the partition P α(qn),
by Lemma 4.

The proof of the proposition is completed by a similar consideration when
n is even.

Theorem 2. Let ∆α
max(m) be the maximum length of the subintervals of the
partition, P α(m) of [0, 1], where α ∈ R\Q and m ∈ N. If qn is the denominator
of the nth principal convergent to α for n ≥ 2, then

∆α

max(qn) = kqnαk + kqn−1αk

Hence, ∆α

max(m) ≤ kqnαk + kqn−1αk for m ≥ qn and n ≥ 2.

Proof. The partition P α(qn) of [0, 1] determines qn + 1 subintervals. We show
that there are only three distinct values for the lengths of these subintervals,
when m = qn, n ≥ 2:

kqnαk , kqn−1αk ,

and kqnαk + kqn−1αk.

(a) From Lemma 2, one of the subintervals of P α(qn) is of the form ({kqnα}, 1) =
({qnα}, 1) when n is odd, or (0, {k1α}) = (0, {qnα}) when n is even, with length
kqnαk.

(b) From Proposition 1 and Proposition 2, we ﬁnd that

(i) there are (qn − qn−1 + 1) subintervals of P α(qn) with length kqn−1αk

(ii) there are (qn−1 − 1) subintervals of P α(qn) with length kqnαk + kqn−1αk.

Thus, from (a) and (b) above, the three distinct values for the lengths of the
qn + 1 [= 1 + (qn − qn−1 + 1) + (qn−1 − 1)] subintervals of P α(qn) with n ≥ 2
are

kqnαk , kqn−1αk ,

and kqnαk + kqn−1αk.

Hence, ∆α
implies ∆α

max(qn) = kqnαk + kqn−1αk. For m ≥ qn, P α(qn) ⊂ P α(m), which
max(m) ≤ ∆α

max(qn) = kqnαk + kqn−1αk, when n ≥ 2.

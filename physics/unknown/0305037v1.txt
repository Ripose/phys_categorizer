Recent studies of spacetime anisotropy in the context of local Lorentz invariance 
(LLI)  based  on  classical  Michelson-Morley  experiments,  as  well  Kennedy-
Thorndyke  tests,  pointed  out  the  existence  of    terms  first  order  in  v/c  and  of 
angular  signatures  independent  of  v.  This  contribution  replaces  the  Lorentz 
symmetry by a velocity gauge transformation following an argument centred on 
observability. Results show even and odd order terms and indicate that motion is 
always  underestimated  in  the  spatiotemporal  platform.  Though  LLI  is  not 
recovered  in  exact  special  relativistic  terms,  the  alternative  looks  compatible 
with  the  relational  aspects  of  general  relativity,  with  variable  speed  of  light 
models as well a nonzero photon mass mγ . 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

Anisotropy in the speed of light plays a central hole on the description of nature 
at  the  fundamental  level  while  the  link  with  metrology  sets  the  importance  of  the 
observational  status.  Recent  studies  [1–7]    reveal  controversial  aspects  of  the 
fundamental  constants  and  their  variation,  such  as  the  fine  structure  constant,  the 
electric  charge,  etc...,  leading  to  possible  variations  of  the  fundamental  couplings,  to 
variable  speed  of  light  theories  opposed  to  conventional  pictures  and  faster  than  the 
speed of light signals.  
Since  these  models  violate  the  Einstein  equivalence  principle  at  some  level, 
 
search  for  possible  Lorentz  invariance  violations  become  important,  particularly  the 
possibility  of  an  anisotropic  propagation  velocity  of  light  relative  to  a  preferred 
reference frame . Following [ 8 ], for a laboratory moving with velocity v at an angle θ 
relative  to a preferred frame, the speed of light can be  written as

where α = - ½ ,β= ½  and δ=0 in special relativity, reducing the above equation to the 
first term. 
Reported  experimental  tests  [8,9]  to  determine  Michelson-Morley  as  well  as 
 
Kennedy-Thorndike coefficients,  PMM = ( ½ – β + δ)  and PKT = (β –  α  – 1) sets the 
current limit to | PMM | ≤  4.2 X 10  –  9  and  | PKT | ≤  6.9 X 10  –  7 , leading to Lorentz 
transformations  confirmed  to  an  overall  uncertainty  ~  8  X  10  –  7  ,  apart  from 
determination of α from different tests [9] and the existence of additional terms in the 
standard model extension that describes Lorentz violations [ 5,8 ], such as first order in

Recently [10], an alternative was proposed by distinguishing the measured (vm) 
velocity of any object from the  effective velocity (v) the object is moving. This results 
from a  time gauge transform that includes the signal delay as 
 
∆tm → ∆t + ∆ti     ( 3 ) 
 
where  ∆tm  is  the  measured  time  of  an  object  evolution,  ∆t it's  proper time  and  ∆ti the 
signal time, or the time required to detect the motion, giving a Lorentz–Einstein  Time

This  indicates  that  velocity  measurements  are  always  understimated  in 
spacetime, that is, c ( ϑ ) ≥ c for any finite signal velocity vS = 2c, a result characteristic 
of the spacetime structure and independent of the existence of a preferred frame. Thus,  
the  odd    vm  /c  terms  of  the  expansion  given  by  (7)  could  be  present  in  the  optical 
experiments designed to test spacetime anisotropy, though they are not considered in the 
corresponding model of Eq. (1). 

Recently,  it  was  proposed  [6]  to  call  'c'  a  "spacetime  structure  constant",  since  
the speed 'c' involved in the local Lorentz transformations must be distinguished from 
the speed of light considered as a signal propagating in a vacuum. In fact, Eq. (6) clearly 
distinguishes  the  measured  velocity  from  the  signal  velocity,  stating  that  the    speed 
value (of any object's velocity) is a result of a balance between the  experimental data to 
the signal that carriers the data,  vm / vS .  

Note that the classical condition corresponds to  v = vm (not to vm = vS ) and is 
equivalent  to  set    vS  →  ∞  in  Eq.  (5).  This  should  be  also  a  relativistic  condition  (  or 
more generally a measurement condition ) where the signal is taken as a 'basis' or a unit 
velocity  vector,  in  terms  of  which  velocities  are  determined.  In  this  sense,  the  gauge 
transformation  of  Eq.  (6)  belongs  directly  to  the  general  theory  of  relativity  –  GR, 
describing the relative motion of dynamical entities, in relation to one another, that is, a 
motion–to–signal ratio. 

In fact, the accuracy of  speed measurements depends on the motion–to–signal 
ratio, or the relative magnitude expressed by vm / vS . Employing Eq. (5), the measured 
spread can be written as,

motion (δv→0 ) the signal uncertainty may count. Also, setting X = 1 above, a residual 
spread is given by the signal itself.

 Now,  for  experiments  that  somehow  divide  the  incident  beam  and/or  mixes 
in  Eq.  (5)  may  become 
signals, 
'reciprocal  vectors' 
indistinguishable;  if  this  drawback    (  v  =  vS  =  vm  )  represents  the  overall  current 
uncertainty  (~10 – 7) for Lorentz violation tests we could argue that "null" results do not 
prove the constancy of the "speed of light" but an experimental situation in which the  
"spacetime structure constant"  'c'  is mixed with a signal propagating in vacuum.  

the 

Another  relevant  point  is  the  convergence  of  results;  for  instance,  angle 
dependent effects, such as Michelson–Morley type tests, preserved about the same limit 
over  two  decades  [9].  This  picture  is  quite  distinct  when  astrophysical  sources  are 
concerned. 

Gamma  Ray  Bursts  (  GRBs)  provide  a  way  to  detect  delays  in  light  pulses 
traversing astronomical distances; reported data [11] registers ∆c / c ranging from 10 – 21  
to 10  –  12 and photon masses mγ  in the 10  –  44  to  10  –  35 g  interval, depending on the 
event. Thus, though Einstein's postulate is preserved to such a level, the spread of data 
is quite different from the laboratory anisotropy tests and the question of whether there 
is a variation of the speed of  light in vacuum is open;  moreover, in the absence of a 
c(ω)  model,  the  phenomenological  approach  relates  the  relative  spread  ∆c  /  c  to  the  
(astronomical) distance D, a 'c' dependent figure. This dependence should not affect the 

   

 4  
 
 
 
relative speed accuracy neither the photon mass results but the absolute 'c' values may 
depend on the same  motion–to–signal ratio above discussed.  

Finally, the photon mass plays a central hole either as an attributable source of 
the c (ω) variation but mainly as a fundamental physical entity; however, SR adoption 
of   mγ = 0  rests on  the energy relation and can be considered a misinterpretation of  the 
kinematical  relativistic  equations  [12].  Here  we  note  that  while  the  Lorentz 
transformation factor ( Eq. (2) ) is closely connected to the photon rest mass definition, 
the gauge transformation alternative term acts on times–Eq.(4) and on velocities–Eq.(6), 
but not on masses; this means the same treatment of SR as far as the energy–momentum 
relations are concerned, including similar figures, but the possibility of  nonzero photon 
masses  and  a  variation  of  the  speed  of  light  trough  a  dependence  on  the  propagating 
signal  that  carries  the  information,  expressed  as  a  velocity  balance  or  a  motion–to–
signal ratio.

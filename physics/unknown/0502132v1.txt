Abstract 

We  report  on  the  progress  in  the  study  of  cascaded  GEM  and  GEM/MHSP  gas  avalanche  photomultipliers 
operating at atmospheric pressure, with CsI and bialkali photocathodes. They have single-photon sensitivity, ns 
time  resolution  and  good  localization  properties.  We  summarize  operational  aspects  and  results,  with  the 
highlight of a high-gain stable gated operation of a visible-light device. Of particular importance are the results of 
a recent ion-backflow reduction study in different cascaded multipliers, affecting the detector's stability and the 
photocathode's liftime. We report on the significant progress in ion-blocking and provide first results on bialkali-
photocathode aging under gas multiplication.

1. Introduction 

Most  particle-physics,  experiments  having  Ring 
Imaging  Cherenkov  (RICH)  systems  with  gaseous 
photon imaging detectors, employ large-area CsI UV-
sensitive  photocathodes  (PC)  and  wire-chamber 
electron multipliers [1]. In recent years there has been 
considerable  progress  in  the  development  of  other 
gaseous  photomultipliers  (GPMs)  [2-7].  The  R&D 
efforts  have  been  generally  motivated  by 
the 
necessity to overcome some basic limitations of wire 
chambers. In these multipliers the avalanche develops 
at the wire vicinity, in an "open geometry", at a short 
distance  (a  few  mm)  from  the  PC.  It  results  in 
significant  photon-  and  ion-mediated  secondary-
avalanches  formation,  limiting  the  detector  gain  and 

its  single-photon  detection  efficiency,  and  also 
affecting  photon  localization  by  broadening  the 
charge  induced  on  the  readout  elements.  The  ion-
induced  secondary-electron  emission  is  particularly 
important in GPMs with visible-sensitive PCs, due to 
their  low  electron  emission  threshold  [8].  Another 
important limitation of wire-chamber GPMs is the PC 
damage  by  avalanche-ion 
in  wire 
chambers,  like  in  parallel-plate  avalanche  chambers 
(PPAC)  and  in  resistive-plate  chambers  (RPC),  all 
avalanche ions are collected at the photocathode.  

impact  [9]; 

Our  R&D  efforts  in  recent  years  have  therefore 
concentrated on the search for electron multipliers of 
a  "closed  geometry",  with  reduced  photon-  and  ion-
feedback  probabilities.  We  have  chosen  cascaded 
"hole multipliers" of different structures, in which the 
avalanche  that  develops  in  successive  multiplication 
stages  is  confined  within  the  holes.  We  have

investigated  their  physical  properties  and  developed 
methods  for  reducing  the  avalanche-ion  backflow 
(IBF),  defined  as  the  fraction  of  total  avalanche-
generated  ions  reaching  the  PC  in  a  GPM;  the 
methods  discussed  below  are  relevant  to  the  stable 
operation of Time Projection Chambers (TPC), where 
the  IBF  relates  to  the  fraction  of  ions  reaching  the 
drift  volume.  Recent  results  of  ion-induced  bialkali 
PC aging under gas-avalanche are presented.  

2. UV GPMs 

The  operation  mechanism    and  properties  of 
GPMs comprising cascaded Gas Electron Multipliers 
(GEM  [10])  with  semitransparent  or  reflective  CsI 
UV-PCs, are summarized in [3,11]. Fig.1 shows a 4-
GEM  "reflective"-GPM  with  a  PC  deposited  on  top 
of the first GEM in the cascade [11]. It reaches gains 
>106,  in  a  variety  of  gases,  including  CF4  [12,13]. 
The resulting high sensitivity to single photons is due 
to  the  efficient  GEM's  optical  screening,  preventing 
the  PC.  The 
avalanche-induced  photons 
reflective-PC  GPM  has 
low 
to  charged-particles  background,  as 
sensitivity 
discussed in [14]; relativistic-particle rejection factors 
>100 were recently demonstrated [15]. This property 
it  is  of  prime  importance  in  Cherenkov  detectors 
operating  under  intense  background,  such  as  in 
relativistic heavy-ion experiments. The photoelectron 
detection  efficiency,  dictated  by  its  extraction  and 
transport 
the  holes,  approaches  unity  at 
reasonable gains, as summarized in [3].

into 

The  compact  structure  of  multi-GEM  GPMs 
results  in  short  multiplication  times,  yielding  pulse-
widths in the 10-20 ns range and single-photon time 
resolutions  <2  ns  [16].  The  narrow  avalanche  width 
permits  resolving  close-by  successive  events;  the 
width  of  the  charge  induced  on  the  segmented 
readout  anode  can  be  tailored  to  cope  with  the 
readout  scheme  [17],  e.g.  by  means  of  a  resistive 
anode  in  front  of  the  readout  circuit  [18].  2D 
localization resolutions of the order of 100 µm RMS 
were  measured  with  a  3-GEM  detector  coupled  to  a 
delay-line  [17].  The  IBF  in  cascaded  GEM  GPMs, 
reaching at best 10-20%, is discussed in paragraph 4. 
The UV-sensitive "reflective" multi-GEM GPM is 
a  mature  technique;  large-area  detectors  are  under 

construction  for  a  Hadron-Blind  Cherenkov  detector 
(HBD)  of  the  PHENIX  (RHIC-BNL)  relativistic 
heavy-ion  experiment  [15];  others  are  developed  for 
RICH  [19].  Similar  photon  detectors,  operated  at 
cryogenic 
the 
temperatures,  are  conceived 
XENON  dark-matter  experiment  [20],  for  dark-
matter  and  neutrino  physics  [21],  for  a  Liquid-Xe 
PET project [22] etc.  

for 

the  avalanche 

With the goal of further reducing the IBF we have 
recently  incorporated  a  Micro-Hole  and  Strip  Plate 
(MHSP)  [23]  into  a  Multi-GEM  cascaded  multiplier 
[24].  The  MHSP  is  a  GEM-like  hole-electrode  with 
anode-  and  cathode-strips  etched  on  its  bottom  face 
(Fig.2);  the  avalanche  developed  inside  the  hole  is 
further  multiplied  on  the  anode  strips.  A  significant 
part  of 
last  strip-
multiplication stage are collected at adjacent cathode 
strips  and  on  the  patterned  readout  cathode  placed 
below  the  MHSP  (Fig.2);  this  leads  to  a  4-5  fold 
smaller IBF in a single MHSP compared to that of a 
single GEM [24]. See paragraph 4 for details on the 
IBF  in  cascaded  MHSP/GEM  GPMs.  Single-photon 
localization  resolutions  of  ~100  µm  RMS  were 
reached  in  such  detectors  with  a  Wedge  &  Strip 
readout cathode [24].

Our  latest  development  is  the  Thick  GEM-like 
(THGEM)  GPM 
is  manufactured  by 
it 
mechanically  drilling  sub-millimeter  diameter  holes 
in a thin printed circuit board followed by Cu-etching 
at  the  hole's  rim.  The  operation  and  properties  of 
these  high-gain  CsI-coated  THGEM-GPMs  are 
described in detail in these proceedings [26].    

3. GPMs for the visible spectral range 

Cascaded-GEM  GPMs  with  visible-sensitive 
bialkali  PCs  have  been  extensively  investigated;  we 
shall point at the highlight of the results, while details 
are provided elsewhere [3, 8, 16]. The first significant 
outcome  is  the  success  in  keeping  semi-transparent 
bialkali  PCs  coupled  to  standard  Kapton  GEMs 
within  indium-sealed  detector  packages  for  a  month 
period, reaching QE values of the order of 13% at a 
wavelength  of  435nm.  However,  the  considerable 
ion-feedback  at  the  PC  limited  the  gain  to  values 
<1000  (spark  limit);  the  secondary  effects  appearing 
well  earlier  [8].  A  stable  high-gain  operation  was

reached  by 
ion-gating 
implementing  an  active 
electrode  [27]:  a  pulsed  alternating-bias  wire-plane, 
introduced  within 
the  cascaded-GEM  structure 
suppressed the avalanche IBF to the PC by factor of 
~104.  This  has  brought  about  the  next  significant 
landmark:  a  gated  4-GEM  bialkali-GPM  (fig.3), 
permitted, for the first time, reaching gains of 106 in 
the  visible  spectral  range  (Fig.4).  The  gating  dead-
time limits the counting-rate to ~0.1-1MHz; though it 
is acceptable in many applications, novel methods for 
ion-backflow  suppression  should  permit  DC-mode 
operation of visible-sensitive GPMs.  

4. Ion backflow reduction 

In  view  of  the  major  role  played  by  backflowing 
ions  impinging  at  the  PC,  particularly  in  visible 
spectral range GPMs, considerable efforts were made 
to understand and to minimize this effect; past studies 
by  others  were  carried  out  in  multi-grid  avalanche 
chambers  [28],  whereas  current  research  focuses  on 
cascaded  multi-GEM 
and  multi-
GEM/MHSP  multipliers  [31],  and  more  recently,  in 
other structures as summarized below. Practically, in 
our case, is the IBF defines the ratio between the ion 
charge collected at the photocathode and the electron 
charge  at  the  last  anode.  Its  dependence  on  the 
multiplier's  geometry,  gas  and  pressure,  electric 
fields,  etc. 
is  generally  well  understood,  as 
summarized in [32]. 

[29,27,30] 

A  key  parameter  controlling  the  IBF  is  the  drift-
field  Edrift  above  the  first  element  in  the  cascaded 
multiplier  (fig.1).  It  was  shown  that  in  detectors 
designed 
to  detect  charges  deposited  by  gas 
ionization, the IBF can be kept low by applying low 
drift-field values; e.g., in TPCs Edrift ~0.1 kV/cm. At 
such  low  fields  the  electron  focusing  into  the  GEM 
holes is very good; typical IBF values are between a 
fraction of a % to a few %, depending mostly on Edrift 
and on the total gain [33,29,30,34], and partly on the 
geometry  of  the  elements  in  the  cascade  [30].  In 
contrary, in GPMs the field at the PC surface must be 
high  (above  0.5  kV/cm),  to  ensure  an  efficient 
photoelectron  extraction  into  the  gas  [13],  which 
contradicts the requirement for small IBF 

Therefore,  under  such  conditions,  the  IBF  in 
multi-GEM GPMs could be reduced at best to levels 

of ~10-20% at a gain of 105 [27,32] with a reflective 
PC  deposited  on  the  first  GEM  and  with  Edrift=0. 
Similarly,  in  a  cascaded  multi-GEM/MHSP  with 
reflective PC, the IBF could be reduced to ~2-3% at 
effective  gains  of  105-106  [31],  due  to  the  efficient 
ion collection by the cathode strips and plane (fig.2). 
However,  this  relatively  small  IBF  value,  adequate 
for  CsI-GPMs,  is  not  sufficient  for  eliminating  the 
in  visible-
ion-feedback  observed 
considerable 
sensitive  GPMs  with  K-Cs-Sb  PCs,  of  which  the 
secondary electron emission probability γ, is 0.05-0.5 
electrons/ion in CH4 and Ar/CH4 mixtures [35]. Such 
high γ values require IBF smaller than 10-4 for stable 
operation at 105 gains. 

In an attempt to further reduce the IBF value, we 
have  lately  implemented  a  reversed-bias  MHSP  (R-
MHSP)  as  a  first  multiplying  element  in  the  GEMs 
cascade [36]. In this particular MHSP operation mode 
[37], the positions of the anode and cathode strips are 
interchanged:  the  avalanche  occurs  only  within  the 
GEM-like  holes,  while  the  cathode  strips  attract  a 
fraction  of  the  up-flowing  ions  originating  from 
avalanches 
in  subsequent  multiplying  elements 
(Fig.5).  However,  as  the  anode  strips  attract  a  large 
fraction  of  the  avalanche  electrons,  the  ion  trapping 
occurs at the cost of a drop in the number of electrons 
transferred  from  the  R-MHSP  to  the  subsequent 
element.  In  our  first  investigations  [36]  the  IBF  was 
two  R-MHSPs 
to  ~1%,  with 
reduced  at  best 
preceding two GEMs at a total gain of ~105; this was 
obtained with a gain in the first R-MHSP  <6. Due to 
the  exponential  nature  of  the  single  electron  pulse-
height  spectrum  many  avalanches  are  of  very  small 
size  and  such  a  low  gain  in  the  first  multiplying 
element does not provide full detection efficiency of 
the single electron events; such a low gain in the first 
R-MHSP  would  also  affect 
the  pulse-height 
resolution  in  multi-photon  events  and  in  ionization 
measurements in TPCs 

Latest  studies  of  multi  R-MHSP/MHSP/GEM 
structures yielded better results [38]. Optimization of 
the potentials across the hole and between anode and 
cathode  strips  of  the  R-MHSP  yielded  gains  >20  in 
this  first  element,  ensuring  full  single-electron 
detection  efficiency.  Various  detector  configurations 
were  investigated  having  a  R-MHSP  as  a  first 
multiplying  element  and  a  MHSP 
last 
multiplying  stage, with GEMs  or  a  second R-MHSP 

the

as  additional  intermediate  elements.  The  drift  field 
above 
the  first  element  was  kept  constant  at 
0.5kV/cm.  The  best  structures  studied  so  far  are  a 
semitransparent  PC  coupled  to  a  R-MHSP  followed 
by  2  GEMs  and  a  MHSP  (Fig.6a),  and  2  R-MHSPs 
followed by a MHSP, with a reflective PC on top of 
R-MHSP1  (Fig.6b);  the  IBF  was  suppresed  down  to 
0.15%  and  0.3%,  respectively,  at  effective  gains  of 
105 (fig.7). These IBF values are by about two orders 
of  magnitude  smaller  than  that  of  cascades  GEMs 
operated  at  similar  gains  and 
the 
photocathode.  The  detailed  results  of  this  study  are 
given  in  [38];  the  search  for  more  adequate  ion 
blocking structures is in course.

5. Bialkali photocathode aging 

in 

the  high-purity  gas; 

The ageing of semitransparent K-Cs-Sb PCs under 
avalanche-ion  impact  is  of  great  concern  in  visible-
sensitive  GPMs,  and  was  recently  investigated  [39]. 
Bialkali  PCs  were  produced  on  glass  substrates, 
under vacuum of ~10-10 Torr, as described in [8]. For 
each  PC,  the  QE  was  measured  upon  production,  in 
the 
then 
vacuum  and 
photocathode  was  coupled  either 
to  a  4-GEM 
multiplier or to a single-mesh electrode which formed 
a parallel-plate multiplier. The number of ions hitting 
the  PC  in  each  configuration  was  tuned  by  varying 
the multiplier's gain. The PC was illuminated with a 
focussed UV-LED light (375 nm) at a photon flux of 
~3*109  photons/mm2.s.  QE  measurements  at  two 
separate spots on the PC, one illuminated and subject 
the  other  obscured, 
to  avalanche-ion  flux  and 
provided  the  ion-inuced  aging  -  corrected  for  the 
decay by chemical processes with the gas impurities. 
Each ageing measurement lasted for the time required 
to  accumulate  10-20  µC/mm2  ion  charge  at  the 
photocathode.. Some aging results of the bialkali PCs 
are  presented  in  fig.8.  One  observes  similar  decay 
rate in all PCs investigated, up to an accumulated ion 
charge  of  ~  2  µC/mm2,  where  the  photocurrent  (the 
QE)  decays  to  ~80%  of  its  initial  value;  then,  the 
decay  rates  differ  among  the  bialkali  PC  specimens, 
as a result of their different surface compositions (and 
in their initial QE) [40]. The decay of the bialkali PCs 
is similar to that of semitransparent alkali-halide PCs 

[9].  A  detailed  description  of  the  method  and 
discussion of the results is given elsewhere [39].  

6. Summary 

A  novel  generation  of  detectors  with  cascaded 
gaseous "hole-multipliers" may provide an improved 
solution  for  photon  imaging.  These  fast  devices, 
sensitive over a broad spectral range, have numerous 
applications  including  the  imaging  of  Cherenkov 
light.  One  of  their  most  important  properties  is  the 
considerable  reduction  of  the  flow  of  avalanche-
induced  ions;  with  cascaded  R-MHSP/GEM/MHSP 
multipliers the IBF to the photocathode was reduced 
by three orders of magnitude as compared to that of a 
is 
MWPC-GPM.  The  back-flowing 
proportional to the gain; therefore, with modern low-
noise electronics and gains of 104, we may expect the 
novel  cascaded  multipliers  to  limit  the  number  of 
ions hitting the photocathode down to a few-to-a few 
tens per photon; the PC's lifetime will be ~1000 times 
longer as compared to that operated within a MWPC 
GPM. We can estimate the IBF effect on the bialkali 
PC aging: the 20% aging observed at an accumulated 
ion charge of 2 µC/mm2, will occur after ~13 years of 
operation  under  a  gain  of  ~105  at  a  photon  flux  of 
1kHz/mm2 (@ QE=30%).   

ion  yield 

Reduced  ion-induced  effects  could  be  crucial  for 
applications  requiring  the  detection  of  large  photon 
flux;  it  is  mandatory  for  the  DC-mode  operation  of 
visible-sensitive  gaseous  photomultipliers,  prone  to 
ion-feedback  effects.  Minimal  IBF  yields  are  also 
very  relevant  to  TPCs,  and  with  small  drift  fields, 
some of the methods discussed in this work have the 
potential of reducing the IBF to one ion per ionizing 
electron.  An  intensive  search  for  further  better 
electron-multiplier structures is in course.

followed by a second R-MHSP and a MHSP. 

 

Fig.5.  The  operation  principle  of  a  R-MHSP  multiplier. 
Photoelectrons undergo "hole" multiplication; part of the electrons 
are  transmitted  to  the  successive  element,  while  a  fraction  of  the 
back-flowing ions from the latter is collected by the cathode strips.

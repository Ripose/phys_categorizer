Abstract. This paper discusses the role of the Skorokhod space and the convergence of proba-
bility measures on it in some recent studies of the foundations of quantum mechanics, both in the
conventional setting over the real number ﬁeld and in the more speculative one of nonarchimedean

local ﬁelds.

1. Introduction.

It is a pleasure and honour for me to have been asked to contribute to to the
collection of articles marking the 40th anniversary of the discovery of the Skorokhod
topology by Professor A. V. Skorokhod. I was a graduate student in Probability
theory at the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta, India in 1956, and still remember
vividly the surprise and excitement of myself and of my fellow students when the ﬁrst
papers on the subject by Skorokhod himself1 and Kolmogorov2 appeared. It was
clear from the beginning that the space D with its Skorokhod topology would play a

1

fundamental role in all problems where limit theorems involving stochastic processes
whose paths are not continuous (but are allowed to have only discontinuities of the
ﬁrst kind) were involved.

The present paper is a brief review of the use of the Skorokhod space and con-
vergence of probability measures on it in some recent studies of quantum systems
over ﬁelds and rings not only over the reals, but also over p-adic ﬁelds3,4. The ﬁrst
application I discuss is to the approximation of usual quantum systems by ﬁnite
quantum systems3. The second4 is a discussion of a path integral formalism ap-
plicable to a class of p-adic Schr¨odinger equations; the corresponding probabi;ity
measure comes from a stochastic process with independent increments and is deﬁned
on the Skorokhod space of functions on [0, ∞) with values in a ﬁnite dimensional
vector space over a nonarchimedean local ﬁeld. This stochastic process and the asso-
ciated measure therefore play the same role in the study of these p-adic Schr¨odinger
equations as the brownian motion in the theory of the usual Schr¨odinger equations.

2. Finite approximations of usual quantum systems. The idea of studying
ﬁnite quantum systems and their limiting forms goes back to Weyl5 in the 1930’s and
Schwinger6 in the 1960’s, and has still retained great interest7. For both Schwinger
and Weyl one of the themes was to approximate quantum systems over R by ﬁnite
quantum systems obtained by replacing R with the cyclic group ZN = Z/N Z
for N large (this is also the basic idea in the so-called theory of the fast Fourier
transform), identifying ZN with the grid {0, ±ε, ±2ε, . . . , ±kε} where N = 2k + 1
and ε = (2π/N )1/2. Weyl was interested only in the kinematics while Schwinger
was interested in the dynamics also. Schwinger introduced the position coordinate
qN as the multiplication by the function kε 7→ kε on the grid, and the momentum
coordinate pN as the Fourier transform of qN on the ﬁnite group ZN using the
identiﬁcation above. Schwinger’s principle was that the ﬁnte dimensional operator
H (s)
N + V (qN ) is a very good approximation to the energy operator
H = (1/2)p2 + V (q) for large N . Numerical work for the case of the harmonic
oscillator showed that this was true3, and the question naturally arose if this could
be substantiated by a limit theorem. In3 it was shown that, in arbitrary dimension
d and for potentials V which go to inﬁnity faster than log r at inﬁnity on Rd, we
have

N = (1/2)p2

||e−tH(s)

N − e−tH ||1 −→ 0

(N → ∞)

where ||·||1 is the trace norm (the condition on V insures that the operators e−tH
are of trace class for every t > 0).

The method of proving this theorem is to use the Feynman-Kac formula8 for
the propagators of the Hamiltonian H. Such a formula is not available for the ap-
proximating Schwinger Hamiltonian H (s)
N ; but, if one replaces the free Hamiltonian

2

by a second diﬀerence operator which is the discrete analogue of the Laplacian,
then one has such a formula. One can call such Hamiltonians stochastic because
the measure on the path space comes from a stochastic process with independent
increments, namely the random walk, on the lattice LN = (εZd). In the case of
the ﬁnite approximation when the inﬁnite lattice is truncated to a ﬁnite one, the
path space measure still exists, but is now assocaited to a random walk with some
boundary conditions that keep the walk inside the ﬁnite grid L∗
N . It is not diﬃ-
cult to show that the Schwinger Hamiltonian is a better approximatioin than the
stochastic Hamiltonian and so it is enough to establish the limit theorem for the
stochastic ones. We shall denote these by HN in the case of the inﬁnite lattice and
H ∗

N in the case of the ﬁnite lattice.

For the continuum limit the path integral deﬁning the propagator is with re-
spect to the so-called brownian bridges, namely the measures Pt
x,y deﬁned by the
conditional brownian motion starting from x at time 0 and exiting at time t through
y. But, for the approximating processes, the measures are deﬁned only on step func-
tions with values in the lattices LN , L∗
N . It is therefore essential, since one wants to
discuss the approximation at the level of the probabiltiy measures on path spaces,
to have all the measures deﬁned on a single space. This has to be the Skorokhod
space Dt of functions on [0, t] with values in Rd with discontinuities only of the ﬁrst
kind.

The fundamental result that allows one to prove the approximation theorem
is the following local limit theorem on the Skorokhod space. Let Pt
N,a,b be the
conditional probabilty measure on Dt for the random walk on the approximating
lattice LN that starts from a ∈ LN at time 0 and exits from b ∈ LN at time t. Then

Theorem Fix x, y ∈ Rd and let a, b ∈ LN vary in such a manner that a → x, b → y
as N → ∞. Then

in the sense of weak convergence of measures on Dt.

Let us now recall that the operators e−tH and e−tHN are integral operators

with kernels Kt, KN,t where

Kt(x, y) =

The traces of these integral operators are calculated by integrating the kernels on

The second step is then to show that the trace limit relation continues to hold on
going from LN to L∗

KN,t(a, a) → T r(e−tH) =

The limit theorem and its consequence require extensive use of techniques that

are basic to the theory of the Skorokhod spaces and are discussed in detail in3.

3. p-adic Schr¨odinger equations and path integral representations for
their propagators in imaginary time.

Already in the 1970’s and in fact much earlier even there was interest in under-
standing the structure of quantum mechanical theories over nonarchimedean local
ﬁelds and even discrete structures like ﬁnite ﬁelds9. In recent years this interest has
deepened, and mathematical and physical questions which may be viewed as the
nonarchimedean counterparts of well-known quantum mechanical questions have
begun to be studied over nonarchimedean ﬁelds10. In this section I shall discuss
brieﬂy one such aspect of p-adic analysis, namely, Schr¨odinger equations over p-adic
ﬁelds; the proofs of the statements made here will appear elsewhere4.

Let K be any nonarchimedean local ﬁeld of arbitrary characteristic and D a
division algebra of ﬁnite dimension over K. We shall assume that K is the center
of D; this is no loss of generality since we may always replace K by the center of
D. Let dx be a Haar measure on D and | · | the usual modulus function on D:

d(ax) = |a|dx (a 6= 0),

|0| = 0

It is then immediate that | · | is a multiplicative norm which is ultrametric (i.e.,
|x + y| ≤ max(|x|, |y|)) that induces the original topology.

Let F be a left vecor space of ﬁnite dimension over D. By a D-norm on F is

meant a function | · | from F to the nonnegative reals such that

(i) |v| = 0 if and only if v = 0
(ii) |av| = |a||v| for a ∈ D and v ∈ F

4

(iii) | · | satisﬁes the ultrametric inequality, i.e.,

|u + v| ≤ max(|u|, |v|)

(u, v ∈ F )

The norm on the dual F ∗ of F is a D-norm. If we identify F with Dn by choosing
a basis, and deﬁne, for suitable constants ai > 0,

|v| = max
1≤i≤n

(ai|vi|)

(v = (v1, v2, . . . , vn))

it is immediate that | · | is a D-norm. It is known that every D-norm is of this form.
In particular all these norms induce the same locally compact topology on F .

For x ∈ F, ξ ∈ F ∗, let us write xξ for the value of ξ at x. If χ is a nontrivial
additive character on D, then ψξ(x 7−→ χ(xξ)) is an additive character of F , every
additive character of F is of this form, and the map ξ 7−→ ψξ is an isomorphism
of topological groups from F ∗ to ˆF , the dual group of F . By S(F ) we denote the
Schwartz-Bruhat space of complex-valued locally constant functions with compact
supports on F . Let dx be a Haar measure on F . Then S(F ) is dense in L2(F, dx),
and the Fourier transform F is an isomorphism of S(F ) with S(F ∗), deﬁned by

F(g)(ξ) =

χ(xξ)g(x)dx (ξ ∈ F ∗)

For a unique choice of Haar measure on F ∗ we have, for all g ∈ S(F ),

g(x) =

χ(−xξ)Fg(ξ)dξ

(x ∈ F )

Z

Z

The measures dx and dξ are then said to be dual to each other. For all of this,
see11.

It is natural to call p-adic Schr¨odinger theory the study of the spectra and
semigroups generated by operators in L2(F ) where F is a ﬁnite dimensional vector
space over D, of the form

Here H0 is a pseudodiﬀerential operator and V is a multiplication operator. The
simplest examples of H0 are as follows. We write Mb for multiplication by |x|b(b > 0)
in

and, denoting by F the Fourier transform on H, we put

H = H0 + V

H = L2(F )

∆F,b = FMbF−1

5

The Hamiltonian will then be of the form

HF,b = ∆F,b + V

It is clear that over the ﬁeld of real numbers and for b = 2 the operator ∆F,b is
just −∆ where ∆ is the Laplace operator. The Hamiltonians HF,b are thus the
counterparts over D to the usual ones that appear in the conventional Schr¨odinger
equations.

I shall now indicate how a path integral representation can be given for the
propagators in iamginary time for the Hamiltonians H deﬁned above in the nonar-
chimedean context. The key is the following.

Proposition Fix t > 0 and b > 0 and let F be a n-dimensional left vector space
over D with a D-norm | · |. Then the function ϕ on V ∗ deﬁned by

ϕ(ξ) = exp(−t|ξ|b)

(ξ ∈ F ∗)

is in Lm(F, dξ) for all m ≥ 1 and is positive deﬁnite.
If we denote by ft,b the
(continuous) probability density on F whose Fourier transform is ϕ, then ft,b is
> 0 everywhere. Moreover (i) 0 < ft,b(x) ≤ f (0) ≤ A t−n/b for all t > 0, A being
a constant > 0 not depending on t (ii) For 0 ≤ k < b we have, for all t > 0 and a
constant A > 0 independent of t,

|x|kft,b(x)dx ≤ A tk/b

ZF

It follows from this that the (ft,b)t>0 form a continuous convolution semigroup
of probability measures which goes to the Dirac delta measure at 0 when t → 0.
Hence for any x ∈ F one can associate a separable F -valued stochastic process with
independent increments (X(t))t≥0 with X(0) = x, such that ft,b is the density of
the distribution of X(t + u) − X(u) for any t > 0, u ≥ 0.

Let D([0, ∞) : M ) be the space of right continuous functions on [0, ∞) with
values in the complete separable metric space M having only discontinuities of the
ﬁrst kind. For any T > 0 we write D([0, T ] : M ) for the analogous space of right
continuous functions on [0, T ) with values in the complete separable metric space M
having only discontinuities of the ﬁrst kind, and left continuous at T . Then one can
prove that the X-process has sample paths in the Skorokhod space D([0, ∞) : F ).
More precisely we have .

Theorem There are unique families of probability measures Pb
and PT,b

x on D([0, ∞) : F )
x,y(x, y ∈ F ) on D([0, T ] : F ) , continuous with respect to (x, y), such that

6

Pb
x is the measure of the X-process that starts from x at time t = 0, and PT,b
x,y is
the probability measure for the X-process that starts from x at time t = 0 and is
conditioned to pass through y at time t = T .

Feynman–Kac propagator for e−tHF,b (t > 0) From now on one can use standard
arguments8, when V is bounded below and HF,b is essentially self-adjoint on S(F ),
to show that the operator e−tHF,b (t > 0) is an integral operator in L2(F ) with
kernel

Kt,b(x : y)

(x, y ∈ F )

which is represented by the following integral on the space Dt = D([0, t] : F ) :

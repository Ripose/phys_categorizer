Abstract

This paper combines the idea of analytic continuation of operators — opera-
tors acting complex s-times introduced in [1], and the operators which generate a
Tree for generating Bernoulli numbers Bn found in [2], to give B(s), the analytic
continuation of Bernoulli numbers.

Surprisingly, the analytic continuation B(s) actually ﬁxes the arbitrariness in
1/2 to be redeﬁned as B1 = 1/2 for
the sign convention of B1, requiring B1 =
consistency. A ﬁrst application results in the derivation of a simple relation between
the Riemann zeta function and its derivative.

−

Further application of B(s) leads naturally to B(s, w), the analytic continuation
of Bernoulli polynomials Bn(w). B(s, w) also ﬁxes the arbitrariness in the sign
convention of Bn(w), and introduces an exciting concept: the dynamics of the zeros
of analytic continued polynomials. The continuity shows the intermediate stage of
how a Bernoulli polynomial of degree n can pick up an additional zero as the discrete
n which increases by one is analytic continued to a continuous parameter s — the
additional zero simply “ﬂows in from inﬁnity”. As it ﬂows in, interesting scatterings
among the zeros — point, loop, and long-range scatterings — are observed.

Introduction: Bernoulli Numbers

Bernoulli numbers are interesting numbers. They appear in connection with
a wide variety of areas, from Euler-Maclaurin Summation formula in Analysis [2]
[6] and the Riemann zeta function in Number Theory [7] [8], to Kummer’s regular
primes in special cases of Fermat’s Last Theorem and Combinatorics [9].

2 A Tree for Generating Bernoulli Numbers

It was shown in [2] how a binary Tree for generating Bernoulli numbers can be
intuited step-by-step and eventually discovered. In the process of calculating the
analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function to the negative half plane term-
by-term, an emerging pattern was observed. The big picture of the structure of
the Tree became apparent on comparing the derived expressions with the Euler-
Maclaurin Summation formula.

In this paper, we start with the Tree and proceed on to ﬁnd interesting appli-

cations. While doing so, we will encounter some surprising consequences.

The Tree can be constructed using two operators, OL and OR.

At each node of the Tree sits a formal expression of the form ±

1
a! b! . . .

.

Deﬁne OL and OR to act only on formal expressions of this form at the nodes

of the Tree as follows:

OL :

OR :

±

1
a! b! . . . →
1
a! b! . . . →

±

1
∓
(a + 1)! b! . . .
1
±
2! a! b! . . .

Schematically,

•

OL acting on a node of the Tree generates a branch downwards to the left
(hence the subscript L in OL) with a new node at the end of the branch.

3 Analytic Continuations

3.1 Analytic Continuation of Operator

First, we introduce the idea of analytic continuing the action of an operator following
[1]. We are used to thinking of an operator acting once, twice, three times, and so
on. Surprisingly, an operator acting integer times can be analytic continued to an
operator acting complex times by making the following observation:

A generic operator A acting complex s-times can be formally expanded into a

series as

The region of convergence in s and the rate of convergence of the series will in
general be dependent on operator A, parameter z, and the operand on which A
acts.

3.2 Analytic Continuation of the Tree-Generating Operator

Now that we can analytic continue the Tree-generating operator (OL + OR) with
(11), if we do so, we turn the sequence of Bernoulli numbers Bn into their analytic
continuation — a function

So eﬀectively, by the method of analytic continuation of operator, we have now

obtained the function B(s) as the analytic continuation of Bernoulli numbers.

4 Missing Signs in the Deﬁnition of Bn

Looking back at (1) to (4), we can see that the sign convention of B1 was actually
arbitrary. (15) suggests that consistent deﬁnition of Bernoulli numbers should really
have been

(17)

which only changes the sign in the conventional deﬁnition of the only non-zero odd
Bernoulli numbers, B1, from B1 =

1/2 to B1 = B(1) = 1/2 .

So here’s my little appeal to the Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, and Com-
puting communities to introduce the missing signs into the sum in the deﬁnition of
Bernoulli numbers as in (16) and (17) because the analytic continuation of Bernoulli
numbers ﬁxes the arbitrariness of the sign convention of B1.

The conventional deﬁnition [4] [5] of Bernoulli polynomials Bn(x) also has an ar-
bitrariness in the sign convention. For consistency with the redeﬁnition of Bn =

Open Problems

1. Symmetries

C, has Re(w) = 1/2 reﬂection symmetry in addition
Prove that Bn(w), w
to the usual Im(w) = 0 reﬂection symmetry analytic complex functions. The
obvious corollary is that the zeros of Bn(w) will also inherit these symmetries.

where † denotes complex conjugation.

2. Non-degenerate zeros

Prove that Bn(w) = 0 has n distinct solutions, ie., all the zeros are non-
degenerate.

3. Central zero Theorem

If B2m+1 has Re(w) = 1/2 and Im(w) = 0 reﬂection symmetries, and
(2m + 1) non-degenerate zeros, then (2m) of the distinct zeros will satisfy
(38). If the remaining one zero is to satisfy (38) too, it must reﬂect into itself,
and therefore it must lie at 1/2, the center of the structure of the zeros, ie.,

Bn(1/2) = 0

odd n

∀

(39)

4. Counting of real and complex zeros

Prove that the number of complex zeros zC(n) of Bn(w) lying on the 4 sets
of arcs oﬀ the real plane, Im(w)

= 0, is

zC(n) = 4

Since n is the degree of the polynomial Bn(w), the number of real zeros
zR(n) lying on the real plane Im(w) = 0 is then zR(n) = (n

7. Bounding Envelopes and Trajectories of complex zeros

Find the equation of envelope curves bounding the real zeros lying on the
plane, and the equation of a trajectory curve running through the complex
zeros on any one of the arcs.

8.3 Dynamics of the zeros from Analytic Continuation

Bernoulli polynomial Bn(w) is a polynomial of degree n. Thus, Bn(w) has n zeros
and Bn+1(w) has (n + 1) zeros. When discrete n is analytic continued to continuous
parameter s, it naturally leads to the question:

How does B(s, w), the analytic continuation of Bn(w), pick up an additional

zero as s increases continuously by one?

This introduces the exciting concept of the dynamics of the zeros of analytic
continued polynomials — the idea of looking at how the zeros move about in the
w complex plane as we vary the parameter s .

Continuity shows that the additional zero simply “ﬂows in from inﬁnity”.

11

To have a physical picture of the motion of the zeros in the complex w plane,
imagine that each time as s increases gradually and continuously by one, an addi-
tional real zero ﬂies in from positive inﬁnity along the real positive axis, gradually
slowing down as if “it is ﬂying through a viscous medium”.

For s < 5, the additional zero simply joins onto the almost regularly spaced
array of the real zeros streaming slowly towards the negative real direction. The
array of zeros continue to drift freely until one by one they hit a bounding envelope
which grows in size with s.

As s approaches every integer > 5, an interesting phenomenon occurs: A pair
of real zeros may meet and become a doubly degenerate real zero at a point, and
then bifurcate into a pair of complex zeros conjugate to each other. Thus, the pair
of real zeros appears to “collide head-on and scatter perpendicularly” into a pair of
complex zeros.

•

Point scattering:
A pair of real zeros scatter at a point into a pair of complex zeros which head
away from each other indeﬁnitely.

Loop scattering:
The same as point scattering but the pair of complex zeros loops back to
recombine into degenerate real zeros within unit interval in s and then scatter
back into a pair of real zeros, much like the picture of pair production and
annihilation of virtual particles.

Long-range sideways scattering:
The additional zero that ﬂies in appears as if “it is carrying with it a line
front of shockwave” that stretches parallelly to the Im(w) axis. When the
“shockwave” meets a pair of complex zeros that are looping back, the pair
gets deﬂected away from each other momentarily before looping back again,
while the additional zero gets perturbed and slows down discontinuously.

The whole complex structure can then be reduced to simple combinations of

these 3 kinds of scattering.

2. Derive a set of expressions which give the values of s where the point, loop

and long-range scatterings occur.

9 Conclusion

Bernoulli numbers and polynomials appear in many areas. Further applications
and extended issues of these analytic continuations will be explored in forthcoming
C, (24)
In particular, if we assume the Riemann Hypothesis, when s
papers.
should converge to zero only on the line s = 1/2
it. This remains to be proved.
More of this aspect is analysed in [10].

adapt the executable Mathematica codes from [12]. Have fun!

In the meantime, it would be interesting to imagine what Jakob Bernoulli and
Euler would say on these analytic continuations of their numbers and polynomials!

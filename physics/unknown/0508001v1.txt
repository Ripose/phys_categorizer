Abstract 

 The  Neutrinos  at  the  Main  Injector  (NuMI)  facility  at 
Fermilab  began  operations  in  late  2004.    NuMI  will 
deliver an intense νµ beam of variable energy (2-20 GeV) 
directed  into  the  Earth  at  58 mrad  for  short  (~1km)  and 
long  (~700-900  km)  baseline  experiments.    Several 
from  early 
the  design  and 
aspects  of 
commissioning runs are reviewed.

INTRODUCTION 

A  new  beam  line  facility,  the  “Neutrinos  at  the  Main 
Injector”  (NuMI)  [1],  has  been  constructed  at  the  Fermi 
National  Accelerator  Laboratory  in  Illinois,  to  deliver  an 
intense  νµ  beam  to  what  is  planned  to  be  a  variety  of 
experiments.    The  first  experiment,  MINOS  [2],  will 
perform  definitive 
spectrum  measurements  which 
demonstrate  the  effect  of  ν  oscillations.    The  second, 
MINERνA  [3],  is  an  experiment  1 km  from  the  NuMI 
target to perform neutrino cross section measurements.  A 
third  proposal,  NOνA  [4],  has  been  approved  to  explore 
the phenomenon of CP violation in neutrinos.  

NuMI  is  a  tertiary  beam  resulting  from  the  decays  of 
pion  and  kaon  secondaries  produced  in  the  NuMI  target. 
Protons  of  120 GeV  are  fast-extracted  (spill  duration 
8.6 µsec)  from  the  Main  Injector  (MI)  accelerator  and 
bent  downward  by  58 mrad  toward  Soudan,  MN  (see

MAIN INJECTOR BEAM 

The  MI  is  fed  multiple  batches  from  the  8 GeV 
Booster  accelerator,  of  which  5  are  extracted  to  NuMI.  
The  Booster  can  deliver  5×1012 p/batch,  and  efforts  are 
underway to increase this number [5].  Studies of running 
multiple batches simultaneously in the MI have achieved 
accelerated beams of up to 3×1013 protons.  This number 
is 
and

beam loading compensation system [7] for the MI.

Initiatives  to  produce  higher  intensity  beam  from  the 
MI  with  the  existing  proton  source,  including  multiple 
batch  “stacking”  of  more  than  6  Booster  batches,  could 
increase  the  beam  intensity  to  NuMI  by  a  factor  of  1.5.  
Already, synchronized transfer of 2 batches from Booster 
to  the  MI  (this  is  referred  to  as  batch  “cogging”[8]), 
followed by slip-stacking of the batches to a single batch 
of  ~7×1012 protons[9],  has  been  in  use  for  production  of 
antiprotons  since  August,  2004.    The  goal  in  2005  is  to 
continue slip-stacking for p-bar production, and accelerate 
3.3×1013 protons  per  MI  cycle  (8×1012 ppp  slip-stacked

for  antiproton  production,  2.5×1013 ppp  for  NuMI).  
Future studies will address the feasibility of slip-stacking 
of additional batches for NuMI. 

PRIMARY BEAM TRANSPORT 
The  MI  beam  is  extracted  by  a  set  of  three  kickers  and 
three  Lambertsons  at  the  MI60  region  of  the  MI.    The 
transport  line  to  the  NuMI  target  is  350m  long.    The 
transport  line  will  maintain  losses  below  10-5  to  reduce 
component  activation  and  to  reduce  activation  of  ground 
water.    In  anticipation  of  batch  stacking  in  the  MI,  the 
momentum  acceptance  of 
is 
∆p/p = 0.0038 at 40π mm-mr.  Injection errors of ~1 mm 
lead to targeting errors of ~0.5 mm.  The beam line has 2 
toroids, 44 loss monitors, 24 BPM's, 19 dipole correctors, 
and  10  retractable  segmented  foil  secondary  emission 
detectors for measuring beam profile and halo [10].

TARGET AND HORNS 
The primary beam is focused onto a graphite production 
target of 6.4×15×940 mm3, segmented longitudinally into 
47 fins.  The beam size at the target is 1 mm.  The target 
is  water  cooled  via  stainless  steel  lines  at  the  top  and 
bottom  of  each  fin  and  is  contained  in  an  aluminum 
vacuum  can  with  beryllium  windows.    It  is  electrically 
isolated  so  it  can  be  read  out  as  a  Budal  monitor  [12].  
The target has a safety factor of about 2.2 for the fatigue 
lifetime of 107 pulses (1 NuMI year) given the calculated 
dynamic  stress  of  4×1013 protons/pulse  and  1 mm  spot 
size.  A prototype target was tested in the Main Injector in 
1998 at peak energy densities exceeding that expected in 
NuMI [11].  Studies indicate that the existing NuMI target 
could  withstand  up  to  a  1 MW  proton  beam  if  the  beam 
spot size is increased from 1 mm to 2-3 mm [13]. 

The particles produced in the target are focused by two 
magnetic  “horns”  [14]. 
  The  200 kA  peak  current 
produces  a  maximum  30 kG  toroidal  field  which  sign- 
and momentum-selects the particles from the target.  Field 
measurements on a horn prototype show the expected 1/r 
fall-off  to  within  a  percent.    The  horns  are  designed  to 
withstand  107  pulses  (1 NuMI  year),  and  tests  without 
beam of the prototype horn have so far achieved this.  The 
relative  placement  of  the  two  horns  and  the  target 
optimizes the momentum focus for pions, hence the peak 
neutrino beam energy.  To fine-tune the beam energy, the 
target  is  mounted  on  a  rail-drive  system  with  2.5 m  of 
longitudinal travel, permitting remote change of the beam 
energy without accessing the horns and target [15].  The 
neutrino  spectra  from  several  target  position  settings  are 
shown in Figure 2. Both the target and horns are protected 
by  an  upstream  collimating  baffle,  consisting  of  air-
cooled graphite with an inner 11mmØ bore.

Each  of  the  two  horns  and  the  target  are  supported 
lowered  by 
beneath  shielding  modules  which  are 
overhead crane into the target cavern.  Using the modules, 
failed  horns  or  targets  may  be  lowered  remotely  into  a 
shielding pit for disposal.  The horns, target, and support 
modules  are  cooled  in  the  target  cavern  via  recirculating 
air system flowing at 25 km/hr.  Should significant proton 
intensity  upgrades  be  pursued,  this  air  system  would 
require  upgrade  and  the  air  flow  volume  better  sealed  to 
contain contamination from radioactive air molecules. 

DECAY VOLUME AND ABSORBER 
Particles are focused by the horns into a 675 m long, 2 m 
diameter  steel  pipe  evacuated  to  ~1 Torr.    This  length  is 
approximately  the  decay  length  of  a  10 GeV  pion.    The 
entrance window to the decay volume is a ellipsoidal bell-
shaped  steel  window  1.8 cm  thick,  with  a  1 mm  thick 
aluminum  window  1 m  in  diameter  at  its  center  where 
95% of the entering pions traverse.  The decay volume is 
surrounded by 2.5-3.5 m of concrete.  Water cooling lines 
around the exterior of the decay pipe remove the 150 kW 
of beam heating deposited in the steel pipe and concrete.     

Earlier  plans  to  instrument  the  decay  volume  with  a 
current-carrying wire have been abandoned due to budget

constraints.    Such  a  device  provides  a  toroidal  field  that 
continuously  focuses  pions  along  the  decay  pipe  length 
and increases the ν flux by approximately 30% [16]. 

 
At  the  end  of  the  decay  volume  is  a  beam  absorber 
consisting  of  a  1.2×1.2×2.4 m3  water-cooled  aluminum 
core,  a  1 m  layer  of  steel  blocks  surrounding  the  core, 
followed  by  a  1.5 m  layer  of  concrete  blocks.    The  core 
absorbs  65 kW  of  beam  power,  but  can  sustain  the  full 
400kW  beam  power  for  up  to  an  hour  in  the  event  of 
mistargeting.  In  the  event  of  a  proton  intensity  upgrade 
the  core  would  require  no  modification,  but  the  steel 
blocks might require cooling. 

SECONDARY AND TERTIARY BEAM 
INSTRUMENTATION 
Ionization  chambers  are  used  to  monitor  the  secondary 
and  tertiary  particle  beams  [17].    An  array  is  located 
immediately upstream of the absorber, as well as at three 
muon  “pits”,  one  downstream  of  the  absorber,  one  after 
8 m of rock, and a third after an additional 12 m of rock.  
These  chambers  monitor  the  remnant  hadrons  at  the  end 
of  the  decay  pipe,  as  well  as  the  tertiary  muons  from  π 
and  K  decays.    When  the  beam  is  tuned  to  the  medium 
energy  configuration,  the  pointing  accuracy  of  the  muon 
stations  can  align 
to 
approximately  50 µradians  in  one  spill.    In  NuMI,  the 
hadron  (muon)  monitor  will  be  exposed  to  charged 
particle  fluxes  of  109/cm2/spill,  (107/cm2/spill).    Beam 
tests    of  these  chambers  indicate  an  order  of  magnitude 
safety  factor  in  particle  flux  over  the  rates  expected  in 
NuMI before space charge buildup affects their operation.

COMMISSIONING EXPERIENCE 
Three  short  runs  of  the  NuMI  facility  have  transpired, 
each with a goal of commissioning additional components 
in the beam line.  The first, in December, 2004, extracted 
3×1011ppp  from  the  MI,  delivered  it  down  the  primary 
transport line and sent it to the NuMI beam absorber.  No 
target was in place at this time.  On the first pulse, beam 
was successfully extracted and on the 10th pulse (shown in 
Figure 3), beam was observed at the center of the  Hadron 
Monitor  detector,  located  just  upstream  of  the  absorber, 
thus verifying proper transport and alignment.

vertical) as seen in the last two foil SEM’s upstream of the target 
hall  as  well  as  in  the  2-dimensional  Hadron  Monitor  array 
(between the decay volume and beam absorber). 

The  2nd  commissioning  run  in  Jan.,  2005,  delivered 
3×1012ppp onto the NuMI target and the energized horns 
focused  the  resulting  secondaries  into  the  decay  volume.  
Neutrino  interactions  were  observed  in  the  first  MINOS 
detector.    As  shown  in  Figure  4,  the  neutrino  beam 
instrumentation  was  able  to  track  the  expected  flux  and 
energy  of  the  neutrino  beam  being  produced:    a  muon 
beam was observed whose intensity increased as the horns 
were  ramped  up  and  whose  penetrating  power  (energy) 
increased  as  the  target  was  moved  to  a  higher  neutrino-
energy  position,  in  accordance  with  expectations.    As 
shown  in  Figure  5,  beam-based  alignment  of  the  target 
and  horns  can  be  accomplished  by  using  the  secondary 
beam  instrumentation  to  monitor  particle  fluences  as  the 
beam was scanned across the target, baffle, and horns. 

The  third  run  in  March,  2005,  commissioned  the 
simultaneous  acceleration  of  120 GeV  protons  for  NuMI 
and  for  producing  antiprotons.    The  MI  accelerated  7 
Booster  batches,  2  slip-stacked  together  for  antiprotons, 
and 5 extracted to NuMI.  A cycle time of 3 seconds and a 
per-pulse  intensity  of  2.3×1013 protons  were  separately 
demonstrated.   Neutrino interactions were observed in the 
MINOS  detector  in  Soudan,  MN,  after  approximately 
7×1017 protons on target, consistent with expectations.

OUTLOOK 
After  a  4  week  pause  to  repair  a  leak  in  the  target 
cooling  system,  the  NuMI  facility  resumed  operations  in 
April.  In the coming year it is hoped that the Booster/MI 
complex  will  routinely  deliver  2.5×1013 ppp  every  2sec. 
for  NuMI,  yielding  enough  data  for  preliminary  results 
from the MINOS experiment by year’s end.

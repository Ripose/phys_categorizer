Abstract

 

An  all  solid-state  kicker  pulser  for  a  high  current
induction  accelerator 
(the  Dual-Axis  Radiographic
Hydrodynamic Test facility DARHT-2) has been designed
and fabricated. This kicker pulser uses multiple  solid state
modulators  stacked  in  an  inductive-adder  configuration.
Each  modulator  is  comprised  of  multiple  metal-oxide-
semiconductor  field-effect  transistors  (MOSFETs)  which
quickly  switch  the  energy  storage  capacitors  across  a
magnetic  induction  core.  Metglas  is  used  as  the  core
material to  minimize  loss.  Voltage from  each  modulator
is  inductively  added  by  a  voltage  summing  stalk  and
delivered to  a  50  ohm  output  cable.  A  lumped  element
circuit model of the inductive adder has  been developed to
optimize  the  performance  of  the  pulser.    Results  for
several  stalk  geometries  will  be  compared  with
experimental data.  

1  INTRODUCTION

Fig. 1: Cross section of the solid-state kicker pulser.

  Linear induction accelerator based  x-ray  technology  can
provide time-resolved, 3-D  radiography  capabilities  for  a
hydrodynamic event. A key component of this  technology
is  a kicker system[1].  The kicker system  cleaves a series
of intense electron beam micropulses, and steers the  beam
into  separate  beam  transport  lines  to  achieve  multiple
lines of sight. The first part of this fast kicker system  is  a
high current stripline dipole kicker. The original design of
the pulser which drives this  stripline  kicker was based on
planar triodes[2]. Although  the  performance of  the  pulser
based on this design was very good, the availability of  the
high frequency planar triodes   in  the  future has become a
concern.  This led to the development of  an all  solid-state
kicker  pulser  design  for  the  Dual-Axis  Radiographic
Hydrodynamic  Test  facility  DARHT-2.  The  new  pulser
design  was  based  on  the  Advanced  Radiograph  Machine
(ARM) modulator technology [3].  It  uses  multiple  solid-
state  modulators 
inductive-adder
configuration.  Each  modulator  is  comprised  of  multiple
metal-oxide-semiconductor 
transistors
(MOSFETs)  which  quickly  switch  the  energy  storage
capacitors  across  a  magnetic  induction  core.  Metglas  is
used as the core material to  minimize  loss.  Voltage from
each modulator is inductively added by a voltage summing
stalk  and delivered to  a 50  ohm  output  cable.  The  cross
section of this solid-state kicker pulser is shown in  Figure

2  INDUCTIVE  ADDER  MODEL

A  lumped element circuit model of  the  inductive  adder
has  been  developed  to  optimize  the  rise  time  and
performance  of  the  pulser.  Figure  3  shows  the  lumped
element equivalent  circuit model of the inductive adder.

The capacitance C_s  and the  resistance  R1  are  24  µF
and 50 Ohms, respectively.  The load resistance R_load is
50  Ohms.    The  inductance  of  the  transformer  primary
L_primary is  20.9  µH.  The  effective  leakage  inductance
L_leakage is 20 nH.

3   SIMULATION  RESULTS

Output  voltage  waveforms  were  simulated  using  the
circuit model  for  different  stalk  geometries.  These  cases
were chosen based on the  stalks  made for the  experiment.
Figure  4  shows  the  plots  of  output  voltage  versus  time
with a 50 Ohm stalk. The capacitors are charged to 650 V

initially.  With  thirty  modulator stacks,  the  total  voltage
should  go  to  19.5  kilovolts.  For  the  simulation,  the
switches are closed  from  10  ns  to  100  ns.    With  a  50
Ohm  stalk,  L1  and  C1  are  6.5  nH  and  2.6  pF,
respectively. If a stalk  is  matched    to  the  load,  we  will
expect the  output  voltage waveform to  be a  square  wave
except during the  rise and  fall  time.  The  output  voltage
plot of the 30th stack in Figure  4  shows  that  the  50  Ohm
stalk doesn't  match into the 50 Ohm  load. The waveform
indicates that the impedance of the stalk should be reduced
in order to match into the load impedance.   This  is  due to
the presence  of the effective leakage inductance. The plots
of output voltage  versus time  with  a 12.6  Ohm  stalk  are
shown in Figure 5. With 12.6  Ohm  stalk,  L1  and C1  are
1.6  nH  and 10.3  pF,  respectively. There is  an  overshoot
in  the  output  voltage  waveform  in  Figure  5.  This
indicates that  in  order to  match into  the  load  impedance,
the impedance of the stalk should be increased .

Figure 5: Output voltage versus time with a 12.6Ω stalk.

    Figure  6  shows  the  plots  of  output  voltage  versus
time  with  a 18.9  Ohm  stalk.  With  18.9  Ohm  stalk,  L1
and C1  are 2.5  nH  and 6.9  pF,  respectively.  The  output
voltage  waveform  indicates  that  this  18.9  Ohm  stalk
provides a better match into  the  load impedance compared
to  other  available  stalks.    This  result  agrees  with  the
experimental  data.  The  output voltage versus time  from
experimental data with 50  Ohm  stalk  is  shown  in  Figure
7.  For  the  experiment, the  output  voltage has  a negative
value.  We can see that  the  output  voltage waveforms are
similar  (except longer rise time)  between  the  simulation
result  and experimental data. The   output  voltage  versus
time from the experimental data with a 12.5 Ohm  stalk  is
shown  in  Figure  8.  There is  an overshoot  in  the  output
voltage  waveform  as  we  have  also  seen  from 
the
simulation result.

4  SUMMARY

A  lumped element circuit model of  the  inductive  adder
kicker  pulser  has  been  developed.  Output  voltage
waveforms  were  simulated  using  the  circuit  model  for
different stalk geometries. Based on the estimated effective
leakage inductance, the  simulation  results  agree  with  the
experimental data on the choice of stalk.

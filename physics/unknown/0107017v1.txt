Abstract

Lorentz invariance implies that massive particles must propagate in an

inertial frame, and that their speed may approach, but never equal, the speed of
light in vacuum in any inertial frame.

Considering two inertial frames moving in opposite directions at any arbitrary

speed, an asymmetry often is overlooked in the Lorentz transform of velocities:
Adding a small amount to the difference hardly changes it; however, subtracting
a small amount decreases the difference by more than the full amount
subtracted.

Thus, if astrophysical neutrinos are massive, they will be detectible only from
sources approaching Earth; sources receding from Earth in general will produce
neutrinos too far lowered in energy to be detected.   If not massive, these
neutrinos generally will be detectible independent of the velocity of the source.

Calculations reveal that even ordinary thermal motion at reasonable

temperatures will make massive neutrinos undetectible by current instruments.
Thus, if flavor oscillations occur, detector data will be unusable unless corrected
for recessional energy losses.

The formula for addition of relativistic velocities is given in elementary texts [1] as,

Let us imagine two objects S ("Source") and D ("Detector") initially at rest with respect

to one another.  If we now assume they are put in motion exactly in opposite directions,
and that their speeds in the original rest frame are  vS  and  vD , we may use (1) to
calculate their new relative speed  vSD  as,

This speed is the same except for sign in the frame of either object.   If S now emits a
particle p at speed  uS  in the S inertial frame, in the direction of D so as to be detected by
D, the speed  vpD  of p in the frame of D will be given by,

in which the magnitude of the velocity is taken as positive in the only way possible for p
to be detected.

Possibly surprisingly, the speed defining the energy of detection given by (3) is

dominated by the speed of recession  vSD , which necessarily must be lower than the speed
which defined the energy of the particle in the frame of its creation.  For example, if

Energy of a Relativistic Particle in Two Frames

The general formula for the relationship among speed, energy, and mass of a freely

propagating relativistic particle is,

in which the rest mass m of the particle is in  energy c 2  units.   We may use this to
derive a formula for energy  ED  at the detector in (3) above:

Substituting (3) into (5) and (6) we obtain,

As expected, in (7) a particle created with speed  u

We also may solve (4) for v and then use the result as an expression for  uS ,

Substituting this into (7), we obtain a fairly simple formula to describe our result,

Application to Neutrinos

The electron neutrinos detected from supernova SN1987A ranged around 15 MeV [2]
and arrived so promptly that their mass can not have been over a few tens of  eV c2 .   For
particles at this energy, and masses in the fractional  eV c2  range but not exceeding that
eliminated by experiment [3 - 5], Eq. (9) is plotted in Figure 1:

Figure 1.   Effect of nonrelativist speed of recession on the detected energy of
a massive, 15 MeV neutrino.   Note that half of all 15 MeV neutrinos created
by a high-temperature source generally will arrive with only a few hundred
keV because of thermal motion.

All that matters here is velocity, so the far more energetic atmospheric neutrinos only

would be a little closer to c, if massive, and would exhibit about the same recessional
energy loss.

Clearly, for astrophysical or even planetary neutrinos of any mass at all, but below
upper limits values known by laboratory experiment, around half of them will vanish
from detectibility merely by thermal motion of the source.   Neutrinos from distant
galaxies will be undetectible if massive, because of the red shift equivalence to a velocity.

This result is rather surprising, but it opens up the possibility of explaining many of
the observed mysteries of neutrino disappearance with an alternative to the somewhat
flawed [6] neutrino oscillation theory.

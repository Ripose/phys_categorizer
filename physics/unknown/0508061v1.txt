Abstract 
 

 

Symmetry  breaking  is  discussed  in  this  paper  which  comes  from  the  Lorentz 
transformation of special relativity and changes our view that two relatively moving 
bodies always have the  relative  speed  equal in  magnitude and opposite  in direction. 
An  appeal  was  made  for  the  test  of  Lorentz  transformation  in  a  multimedia 
environment which has the fundamental significance that it may reveal the origin of 
symmetry breaking in many physical phenomena.   

In  1905,  Albert  Einstein  published  his  special  relativity  that  changed  our  view 

about space and time where Lorentz transformation is the foundation of its formulism. 

In Lorentz transformation, an inertia frame independent velocity scale was introduced 

which served by the light speed in vacuum1. However, bodies are not always moving 

in vacuum. If two bodies are relatively moving in two different media, such as a fish 

swimming in a lake and a bird flying in the sky, what will happen? 

As shown in Fig. 1, suppose water is resting relative to air, and take the water/air 

system as reference frame. There is a ball moving in water and another ball moving in 

air. Now we consider the relative speeds between ball 1 and ball 2. 

 

Figure 1 Two relatively moving balls in two different media. The upper half is air and the lower 
half is water; air and water are resting relative to each other and taken as reference frame; ball 
1  is  moving  towards  right  with  velocity  u  relative  to  water;  ball  2  is  moving  towards  left  with 
velocity u’ relative to air. Right is assigned as the positive direction. 

Firstly,  we  consider  the  velocity  of  ball  2  relative  to  ball  1.  To  measure  the 

velocity of ball 2, ball 1 must receive the light from ball 2. Since ball 1 is moving at 

velocity u relative to water, equivalently, that is to say, water is moving at velocity –u 

relative to ball 1. Therefore, the velocity scale in Lorentz transformation should be the 

speed of the light from ball 2 measured by ball 1. According to Fresnel’s drag formula, 

the speed of the light from ball 2 measured by ball 1 is

where  c   is the light speed in vacuum and 

wn   is the refractive index of water. 

Considering  the  refractivity  of  medium,  the  velocity  measured  in  water  is  not 

equal to that measured in air, there is

Secondly,  we  consider  the  velocity  of  ball  1  relative  to  ball  2.  To  measure  the

the speed of the light from ball 1 measured by ball 2 is

The former is the energy of ball 2 from the viewpoint of ball 1, and the latter is the 

energy  of  ball  1  from  the  viewpoint  of  ball  2.  Because

Now  the  question  is:  Is  it  possible  that  an  experiment  is  designed  to  test  this 

difference  of  energy?  This  will  be  a  new  test  of  Lorentz  transformation  in  a 

multimedia environment. Whatever the result is, it will lead to a new comprehension 

of Lorentz transformation.   

Someone  may  argue  that  the  velocity  scale  in  Lorentz  velocity-addition  formula 

(namely, formula (4) and (9)) should also be the light speed in vacuum. Even so, the 

symmetry breaking still exists. If we replace 

wc   in (4) with  c , we get

  J. This result may mean that symmetry breaking mainly originates from 

the  refractivity  between  media  rather  than  Lorentz  transformation.  But  a  careful 

thinking  will  reach  that  the  refractivity  between  media  and  the  different  velocity 

scales  in  Lorentz  transformation  amount  to  the  same  thing  in  that  the  refractivity 

between media just originates from the difference of light speeds in them.   

The  symmetry  breaking 

from  Lorentz 

transformation  has 

fundamental 

significance  that  it  may  be  the  origin  of  symmetry  loss  we  are  looking  for  in  our 

fundamental  physics2.  Since  matter  consists  of  different  kinds  of  particles  –  gauge 

bosons, fermions (leptons and quarks), gravitons, or even Higgs particles – and these 

particles never rest and their relative motions keep to Lorentz transformation (as what 

we know by far), the heterogeneity of matter or vacuum (such as vacuum polarization 

or  so)  will  break  symmetry  spontaneously  due  to  the  variance  of  velocity  scale  in 

Lorentz  transformation,  which  means  that  symmetry  breaking  may  originate  from 

particles’ environments and their mutual relations, i.e., symmetry breaking may be a 

systematic emergence.   

Recent  works  by  Gupta  have  revealed  that  gravity  may  be  the  Second-Order 

Relativistic-Manifestation  of  Electrostatic-Force3.  Based  on  the  relativistic  velocity 

addition formula, Gupta deduced a net attractive force between two bodies composed 

of  atoms,  which  supports  the  possibility  that  symmetry  breaking  may  occur 

spontaneously as a systematic emergence due to Lorentz transformation.

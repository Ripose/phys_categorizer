$EVWUDFW(cid:29) The consequences of the Nazi-power for the scientific process are described qualitatively in various
articles and books. However, recent progress in information systems allows a quantitative reflection. Literature
databases ranging back to the beginning of the 20th century, the ISI citation indexes ranging back to 1945 now
and sophisticated search systems are suitable tools for this purpose. In this study the overall break in the
scientific productivity and that of selected physical journals are examined. An overview of the citation impact of
some 50 leading physicists is given. The productivity before and after departure is analyzed and connected to
biographical data.

The indescribable agony of the victims of the Nazi-terror, in particular the Jews, exceeds any imagination and
cannot be quantified. More comprehensible are the consequences for politics, economics, and science. The
impact on the influence and reputation of German science and the shift of the centers of excellence and the
language of science are well known. The loss of scientific potential and talent to Germany has been extensively
discussed but mostly in a speculative way. In this study, a well established method for evaluating present science
was used to analyze the past. We have determined the citation impact since 1945 of the publications of some of
the most influential emigrants in physics. The break in productivity is measurable when relating the more recent
impact to the publication years of the cited papers of the emigrants. In consideration of their hard fate and their
huge contribution even to current science they should never fall into oblivion.

0HWKRG(cid:29) The data presented here are mostly based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) marketed by Thomson
ISI (Institute of Scientific Information). The findings result from the Web of Science (WoS), the search platform
provided by ISI, as well as the database SciSearch (SCI under the host STN International). The search options
available under STN have made it possible to perform extensive citation analyses. Currently, SciSearch only
covers the source items (citing papers) since 1974, whereas the WoS stretches back to 1945. The cited papers
(references) within the citing papers from the publication time period 1945 (or 1974) until present stretch back
before 1945. The data on table 1 and figures 7 and 8 were established by combining WoS and STN.

Recently, the literature file of the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) of the American Chemical Society (ACS)
was extended back to 1907, the year when CAS was founded. This file covers not only chemical literature, but
also a large amount of literature from the life sciences and physics as well. Therefore, the time curve of the
publications per year covered by this file visualizes well the break in scientific productivity caused by World
War I and II (see figure 1).

1907-1960. From the literature file of the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) of the American Chemical Society.

The war-caused breaks are also reflected in the age distribution of the overall publications from pre-1960 cited
by more recent publications. The age distribution for the time period 1900 until 1960 of all references cited
within all SCI documents since 1974 was determined (see figure 2). Compared with the publication time curve
the reference age curve is smoothed out somewhat by the time gap between the date of publication and citation.

)LJXUH(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:29) Age distribution of references published between 1900 and 1960 and cited in SCI documents
published in the time period 1974-2004. The peak at publication year 1951 corresponds to the most-cited
scientific paper of all times (O.H. Lowry: J. Biol. Chem. V193 P265 (1951), about 280,000 citations).

As in the case of the overall scientific output, the CAS literature file can also be utilized to determine the time-
dependent output of single journals. No distortion of the time curve is expected, although the articles of physics
journals are not covered completely in the CAS file. The time-dependent number of publications per year was
determined for two leading German physics journals (Annalen der Physik, Zeitschrift für Physik) from the first
half of the twentieth century. The output of these journals decreased from some hundred publications per year to
about zero in 1945 (see figures 3 and 4). In comparison with these journals the output decrease of Physical
Review and other US journals (e.g. JACS) is less dramatic.

The output decrease of a specific journal should be reflected in a similar decrease of its citation impact, even if
the citation time period is shifted in time many decades. In order to test this conjecture, the reference age
distribution of citations within SCI documents published since 1974 to pre-1970 articles of some leading physics
journals was analyzed. The impact break is most dramatic for Zeitschrift für Physik which published many
articles from the golden age of physics before World War II (see figure 5). As in figure 2 the number of citing
papers (not the number of citations) was determined. Note that one citing paper may include more than one
citation (reference) of articles from a specific journal and one and the same publication year (e.g. two articles
from Zeitschrift für Physik both published in 1930).

Date of searching: 24.06.04 - 14.07.04

7DEOH(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:29) Physicists who departed positions in Germany during the time period 1933 to 1945. Some younger
scientists who left Germany before finishing their formal education (J.M. Blatt, W.J. Choyke, R. Landauer, F.
Stern, and H. Suhl) are included.

The number of citing papers (rather than citations, one citing paper may include more than one citation) were
established using the WoS. The citing papers cover the time period from 1945 until 2004. There is no citation
index available reaching back before 1945. The cited papers (i.e. the references related to the papers of the
analyzed scientists) alternatively cover all publication years (3rd column) and only the papers published in the
time period from 1900 until 1944 (4th column).

Some high-impact scientists (with more than about 5000 citations) exceed the WoS system limits. In that case
the citing papers were estimated under WoS only for the period from 1945 till 1973 and then completed under
STN for the period from 1974 till 2004. The citing papers of co-author publications (the selected author is not
the first author) are only included if the papers are WoS source items (i.e. no pre-1945 co-author papers are
covered).

The citation data established under STN for the citation time period from 1974 till 2004 only include the
citations of the first author publications. Thus, the given overall numbers of citing papers related to some high-
impact authors are lower limits. However, most of the early papers have only one single author and no
substantial loss of citations can be expected. The citing papers of three of the most cited scientists (Bethe, Born,
and Herzberg) could only be determined under STN for the time period since 1974 because of the WoS system
limits.

Some scientists have namesakes. An effort was made to purge their papers by using the cited reference tables of
the WoS. If the data of authors with namesakes had to be completed under STN (Franck, Simon), reference
publications years after the year of death were excluded. After their emigration, some scientists preferred using
middle name initials (instead of simply the first names they used before 1945). The author searching was
conducted with truncation after the first initial. By this procedure all versions were included.

Note that the given citation numbers are restricted to the citation time period since 1945 and therefore the impact
of the earlier papers published before 1945 cannot be completely determined. Moreover, many famous articles
are assumed to be well known and are therefore not cited as full references (e.g., the Fröhlich

6

Hamiltonian). The large overall impact of some scientists (Bethe, Born, Debye, Fröhlich, Heitler, Herzberg,
Peierls, Wigner) is partially due to highly cited books.

The overall impact of all 52 emigrants of table 1 has also been determined. The number of citing papers
increased from 5000 in the year 1974 to about 8000 at present (see figure 6). As the physical disciplines
increased by about the same amount, we may conclude that there is an unusually persistent interest involving the
work of the emigrants being analyzed here. This exemplifies the great loss to their countries of origin, which
probably still affects today their scientific standing.

)LJXUH(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:29) Time-dependent overall impact of the 52 emigrants of table 1.

Some interesting information is obtained from the time-dependence of the citations of single articles. The time-
dependent citation graph for an article is sometimes called its citation history and may be viewed as the sales
figure of that article. The citations generally do not increase substantially until one year after publication. They
normally reach a maximum after about three years and then usually decrease, accumulating citations at a lower
level. However, some highly important articles show a distinctive time delay in their citations, which signifies
that they were ahead of their time (see figures 7 and 8).

)LJXUHV(cid:3)(cid:26)(cid:3)DQG(cid:3)(cid:27)(cid:29) Citation histories of two highly-cited papers of Walter Kohn and Eugene Wigner, a young and
a senior emigrant. The citations of both papers are highly delayed in time.

Citation bar diagrams with the numbers of citations (since 1945) as function of the publication years of the cited
papers (e.g. the papers of the emigrants) show the relative contribution of publication years (and papers) to the
overall impact (see figures 9 and 10). When analyzing the emigrants of table 1 by this method, we find two
distinct types of immigrants: those with a considerable scientific impact before emigration (for the sake of
discussion 1944 in table 1) and those who left as young children or students, who made their careers largely in
their new countries. The latter can be easily identified by the small number of citing papers in the right hand
column of table 1 (Blatt, Choyke, Kohn, Landauer, Spear, F. Stern ... and maybe also Barschall, Goldhaber,
Goldhaber-Scharff, Pais, and Panofsky). They also must be viewed as a considerable loss of talent to their
contries of origin.

Among the more senior emigrants the majority of those on table 1 were able to continue a productive career,
several of them an extremely productive one crowned in some cases by the Nobel Prize. A few of them did not
do so well. This is revealed by comparing the last two columns in table 1. In some cases (Goudsmid) they moved
to a highly successful career in science management. A few (Lise Meitner, Otto Frisch, Gustav Hertz, Otto
Stern) seem to have had difficulties adapting to a new, sometimes hostile environment. Fritz Haber, a stauch
Prussian soul, never recovered from the blow and succumbed shortly after emigrating.

)LJXUH(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:29) Citation bar diagram of Max Born with the number of citations since 1945 as function of the
publication years of the cited papers (i.e. the Born-papers). The impact past 1970 (the year of his death) is
mainly due to the various later editions of his book “Principles of Optics” (altogether about 23,000 citations).

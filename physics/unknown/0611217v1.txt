We address the reflection of vector solitons, comprising several components that exhibit 

multiple field oscillations, at the interface between two nonlinear media. We reveal that 

reflection causes fission of the input signal into sets of solitons propagating at different 

angles.  We  find  that  the  maximum  number  of  solitons  that  arises  upon  the  fission  is 

given by the number of field oscillations in the highest-order input vector soliton.

Spatial  vector  solitons  form  when  a  proper  balance  between  diffraction,  self-  and 

cross-modulation in all light components is achieved [1-9]. In cubic media complex vector 

solitons made of incoherently coupled fields may be stable provided that the strength of 

cross-modulation  coupling  does  not  exceed  that  of  self-modulation.  However,  strong 

perturbations modify their internal structure and can lead to their fission. In this Letter 

we address this phenomenon and reveal that controllable fission does occur by reflection 

of the vector solitons at the nonlinear interfaces. 

The  interaction  of  radiation  with  nonlinear  interfaces  gives  rise  to  a  number  of 

phenomena  including  hysteresis,  bistability,  and  surface  wave  excitation  [10-14]. 

Reflection of scalar solitons at nonlinear interfaces has been explored experimentally in 

Refs. [15-18]. Such reflection can cause fission of bound soliton states [19], a process that 

motivates  this  study.  Reflection  becomes  especially  complex  when  several  fields  are 

present [20,21]. We consider reflection of solitons comprising components with multiple 

field  oscillations  and  find  that  such  process  generates  sets  of  diverging  scalar  solitons. 

The maximum number of output solitons is given by the number of field oscillations in 

the highest-order component and is not equal to the overall number of components, as 

one may expect.

We address the reflection of vector solitons comprising N  mutually incoherent field 

components  at  the  interface  of  two  cubic  media  with  different  refractive  indices.  The 

evolution of light beams is described by the system of  N  coupled nonlinear Schrödinger

they  can  be  made  by  stacking  together  different  materials  with  substantially  different

 vector solitons contain components possessing oscillations (see Figs. 1(a),

while at

 the soliton transforms into two well-separated vector solitons with two-

component  with  N  oscillations  only  if  all  lower-order  components  with

 ensures that soliton is launched far enough from the interface at 

η =

. For 

small incident angles 

inα

 the interface reflects solitons almost completely. With increase 

of 

inα

 the  amount  of  radiation  penetrating  into  the  region 

η >

0

 increases  so  that  one 

2

 

 

 

 

may  resolve  both  reflected  and  transmitted  beams  in  the  output  pattern.  For  large 

enough 

inα

 one observes complete soliton refraction. Such behavior occurs for all values 

of 

p

,  but  larger  p  require  greater  incident  angles  for  occurrence  of  partial  and  total 

refraction. Here we are primarily interested in the regime of complete reflection yielding 

effective vector soliton fission and set 

p =

100

. 

The  typical  dynamics  encountered with two-component soliton reflection is shown 

in Fig. 2. While the fundamental mode keeps its profile and amplitude almost unchanged 

after  reflection,  thereby  exhibiting  quasi-particle  behavior,  the  dipole  mode  experiences 

large  shape  transformations  upon  reflection.  Due  to  the  spatial  separation  between 

maxima of 

2w

 component, they arrive at the interface at slightly different distances  ξ . 

The  right  pole  of 

2w
vicinity  of  the  point 

 component  collides  with  the  interface  and  bounces  back  in  the 

η =

0

,  while  the  second  pole  changes  its  propagation  direction  in 

the  vicinity  of  the  location  where  it  meets  the  reflected  right  pole  and 

1w

 component. 

Therefore,  the  left  pole  of  the 

 component  is  reflected  back  at  a  distance  from  the 

2w

interface,  in  contrast  to 

 component.  This  difference  in  reflection  positions  leads  to 

1w

different effective potentials experienced by the corresponding fields, and yields different 

reflection angles (Fig. 2(c)). Notice that upon reflection, the energy concentrated in the 

right hump of the 

2w

 component couples partially into its left hump, radiative field, and 

 component, so that 

1w
into  a  single-hump  soliton.  Thus,  collision  with  interface  results  in  fast  fission  of  input 

 component looses its dipole-like input structure and reshapes 

2w

solitons into set of diverging solitons that are scalar for the chosen set of parameters. 

The  dependence  of  the  angle  δα  between  two  scalar  solitons  emerging  upon 

reflection versus incident angle is shown in Fig. 1(c). For the set  of parameters in Fig. 

1(c) the effective fission of vector soliton occurs at 

α (cid:49)
in

1.2

, since for larger values of 

 refraction dominates. Note that refraction of vector solitons at large incident angles 

inα
typically  does  not  result  in  their  fission,  i.e.  vector  solitons  rather  keep  their  internal 

structure  after  their  pass  though  the  interface.  At  very  small  angles, 

α (cid:49)
in

0.01

,  the 

collision  is  too  weak  and  also  does  not  lead  to  vector  soliton  fission.  Surprisingly,  we 

found that in the interval  α

∈

[0.01,1.2]

 the dependence 

in

angle  δα  reaches  its  minimal  value  at 

α ≈
in

0.05

(δα α

)in
 but  it  never  vanishes.  At 

 is nonmonotonic. The 

α >
in

0.05

 

the  splitting  angle  increases  monotonically.  Notice  that  δα  is  a  nonmonotonic  function 

of 

2b

 as well. The splitting angle vanishes at 

b →
2

0

, when 

2w

 component goes to zero 

 

3

and may not affect the soliton dynamics, while at 

2b → 1b

, vector solitons transform into 

two separated and almost independent beams, each of them being reflected with almost 

equal angles. Thus, the most effective fission occurs for intermediate values of 

2b

. 

We  have  found  similar  fission  scenarios  for  higher-order vector solitons containing 

more  than  two  input  components.  Fission  of  the  three-component  soliton  of  Fig.  3(a) 

whose higher-order component possesses three oscillations is depicted in Fig. 3(c). This 

component)  flying  apart  at  the  smallest  angle,  and  the  less  intense  fragment  (in 

soliton  breaks  into  three  scalar  fragments,  with  the  most  intensive  fragment  (in 

1w
3w
component)  flying  apart  at  the  largest  angle  with  respect  to  ξ  axis.  Interestingly,  one 

 

 

finds  that  the  intensity  redistribution  inside  each  component  is  similar  to  that  for  the 

soliton  of  Fig.  2:  upon  reflection,  energy  concentrated  within  each  component  couples 

into  its  left  outermost  hump,  which  then  gives  rise  to  one  of  scalar  solitons,  while  the 

minimal  distance  between  this  hump  and  the  interface  increases  with  the  order  of 

component. 

A  central  result  of  this  Letter  is  that  the  number  of  spatially  separated  solitons 

that  may  emerge  upon  fission  of  the  vector  complexes  is  determined  by  the  number  of 

oscillations  in  the  highest-order  component,  and  it  does  not  depend  on  the  overall 

number  of  components.  This  point  is  illustrated  in  Figs.  3(b)  and  3(d)  where  we  show 

the  profile  and  splitting  of  a  three-component  soliton  for  which 

1w

 and 

2w

 feature 

similar shapes. One finds that components possessing similar shapes are always reflected 

with the similar angles irrespectively of the energy concentrated within each component. 

Hence,  e.g.,  in  Fig.  3(d)  fission  of  the  input  vector  soliton  give  rise  to  one  two-

component  vector  and  one  scalar  soliton.  We  checked  the  validity  of  this  rule  by 

conducting  extensive  numerical  simulations  of  fission  of  solitons  with  up  to  10 

components, having different symmetries. 

Notice  that  results  presented  here  were  obtained  for  the  interface  of  Kerr  media 

and  that  interfaces  between  saturable  media  exhibit  different  phenomena.  Saturable 

materials  support  solitons  composed  of  only  nodeless  component  and  component 

featuring multiple field oscillations, provided that the saturation degree exceeds a critical 

value [7,9]. Our numerical simulations showed that reflection of such solitons gives rise 

to  several  solitons  with  different  internal  structures.  For  example,  reflection  of  soliton 

having nodeless first and three-humped second component results in appearance of scalar 

 

4

soliton  and  vector  soliton  composed  of  nodeless  and  dipole  components  (Fig.  4).  The 

difference with the Kerr case is clearly apparent.

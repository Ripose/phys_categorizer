ABSTRACT

    In a preceeding paper alternative reflections on gravitation were developed. There it was

assumed that the primary interaction between two masses is not of attractive but of repulsive

nature. The repulsive force results from the impuls transfer produced by the gravitational

radiation which is emitted and absorbed by both masses. The observed attractive force between

the two masses according to Newton`s law of gravitation, however, is a secondary effect and a

consequence of the existence of all the masses in the universe. The mutual screening of the

gravitational radiation of all masses of the universe by the two masses under consideration

leads to the gravitational attraction between them. The  balance between primary, repulsive and

secondary, attractive forces can stabilize highly concentrated spherical mass accumulations with

a linear dependence of their mass on the square of their diameter. Such objects can really be

observed in the universe in the form of globular star clusters, elliptical galaxies and spherical

clusters of galaxies. The scatter of the data of every group is rather large. But the collection of

the objects of all three groups, reaching from the smallest globular star cluster to the largest

spherical cluster of galaxies, with masses differing by almost 12 orders of magnitude, clearly

shows the proposed mass-diameter relation.

clusters - masses - diameters

1. INTRODUCTION

    The main points of the alternative reflections developed in the foregoing paper (Albers 1997)

are recapitulated here shortly to an extent necessary for the understanding of the special points

discussed in more detail in this paper: Every mass emits and absorbs gravitational radiation

which is treated in complete analogy to the laws of optics and electromagnetic radiation. At a

2

certain reference point Q the intensity I of the gravitational radiation ( GR ) is achieved by

summing up the GR of all masses mi surrounding Q at distance  Ri

                                                     I = Sumi (E * mi / Ri

2 ). 

( 1 )

E is a factor of proportionality that describes the efficiency to emit gravitational radiation per

unit of mass. E is taken in the following as a constant, the simplest assumption which is

probably not valid independent of the mass concentration with  values between the mean mass
density of the universe of about 5*10-28 kg/m3 (Unsöld & Baschek 1991) and  the density of
stars of about 103 kg/m3. The emissivity may also depend on other parameters like

temperature etc. If, however, only objects in the universe are considered which are comparable

with regard to the relevant parameters, then the parameter-dependent emissivity may be

replaced by a constant E. The quantity I in equation (1) is named intensity, although it is not

identical but only proportional to the physical intensity defined and measured as energy flux

per second and per unit area.

   If the effect of all masses mj of the universe is summed up according to equation (1) for a

reference point Q one gets a certain intensity Io

    Io = Sumj (E *mj / Rj

2).

                         (2)

This intensity Io, however, is dependent on the reference point Q and will be very high if Q is

located at the center of a spherical cluster of galaxies and will be low if Q is far away from any

mass accumulation, as explained in the preceeding paper (Albers 1997). From this intensity Io

there results an attractive force F between every two masses m1 and m2 located near Q

                                          F = - Io * A*m1 * A*m2 * P / r2.                                                  (3)

Here A*m1 represents the absorption caused by the mass m1 of the gravitational radiation with

intensity Io directed towards m2. From this absorbed part Io*A*m1 the absorption by m2 is

missing which leads to the factor A*m2. The factor P represents the proportionality between the

absorbed radiation and the impuls transfer by the absorption of thís radiation. (Here the term

absorption is representative for all similar processes which can lead to such an impuls transfer).

3

The proportionality of F with r-2, where r is the distance between m1 and m2, with the exact

power of 2, is a consequence of the application of the laws of optics on these phenomena.

   Equation (3) is equivalent to  Newton´s law of gravitation

                                                   F` = - G * m1 *m2 / r2.                                                       (4)

The „universal constant G of gravitation“ of this law , however, which is equal to Io*A*A*P in

equation (3) is no constant but a factor ( gravitational factor ) depending on the mass-

distribution in the universe and the position of the reference point Q. For a first rough estimate

of the attractive force between two masses m1 and m2 according to equation (3) it may be

assumed in the following that the factor Io, described in equation (2), is a constant.

   The attractive interaction between the two masses m1 and m2 according to equation (3) is a

secondary effect, which is a consequence of the existence of all the masses in the universe

which create the intensity Io. The primary effect, however, is the direct interaction between the

masses m1 and m2 which results from the absorption of the GR emitted by m1 and absorbed by

m2 (and vice versa) and leads to a repulsive force between m1  and m2. In this paper this effect

is of interest for a special geometry of m1 and m2: The mass m1 may exist with spherical

symmetry inside a sphere with radius R. At the distance R from the centre, that means at the

periphery of m1,  this mass m1 produces a certain intensity of GR with a directional component

Id,

                                                        Id = E * m1 / R2                                                      

   (5)

as explained in the foregoing paper (Albers 1997). This directional GR from m1 is absorbed by

the mass m2 which is assumed to be located at the periphery of m1. Then the primary interaction

between m1 and m2 is a repulsive force Fr with

                                              Fr = (E*m1/R2) * A*m2 * P

           

   (6)

where the  factor (E*m1/R2) is identical with Id in equation (5).

   The secondary, attractive force between m1 and  m2 according to equation (3) and the

primary, repulsive force according to equation (6) are both proportional to the product m1*m2.

If for masses m1 and m2 sufficiently small compared to the masses of the universe the repulsive

4

force according to equation (6) is smaller than the attractive force according to equation (3), this

must not be valid if the mass m1 is increased more and more. Somewhere the region of linearity

of both forces with the product m1*m2 must be leaved. This becomes clear if one considers the

case that the mass m1 grows to an amount comparable to or larger than the mass of the universe.

Then the repulsive interaction between m1 and m2 ( at their short distance R ) must exceed the

attractive force between them.

   The attractive forces produced according to equations (2) and (3) by all the masses mj of the

universe can lead to mass accumulations. The primary, repulsive force discussed in connection

with equation (6), however, gives some limit concerning mass and concentration of such mass-

accumulations. A mass accumulation with mass m1 , radius R, and spherical symmetry is stable

against the incorporation of a mass m2 located at its periphery, and thus against an increase of

the mass M = m1 and the mean density if there is a balance between  the attractive forces

according to equation (3)  and the repulsive forces according to equation (6). In equation (3) the

term I0*A*m1 represents in this linearized form the part of Io which is absorbed by the mass

m1. If this factor is desribed by the correct exponentional function of absorption it becomes

evident that for increasing values of m1 this factor saturates towards the limit I0 which gives the

upper bound for the attractive forces between m1 and m2. The simplest law concerning the

balance between the attractive forces determined by I0 and the repulsive forces produced by Id

results from the assumption that the value of Id amounts to a certain part alpha of I0:

                                                           Id = alpha * Io   

  

   (7)

With r in equation (3) equal to R in equations (5) and (6), and Io equal to a constant in a first

approximation, this leads to the result

  

M / R2 = constant                                                        (8)

for possible mass accumulations in the universe with mass M and radius R. The spherical

symmetry of such mass accumulations is a consequence of the fact that on large scales  the

mass distribution in the universe is rather homogeneous and thus of radial symmetry. Therefore

also the attractive force according to equations (2) and (3) has spherical symmetry. Such mass

accumulations are in equilibrium and therefore stable for ever if the mass  distribution in the

universe does not change. The mass M of such spherical systems is not limited to a narrow

5

range of values but may possess very small or very high values depending on the amount of

mass which existed anywhere near the condensation points of these systems.

2. SPHERICAL OBJECTS IN THE UNIVERSE

In the universe there exist several systems of mass accumulations with spherical symmetry, but

quite different masses: Planets, stars, globular star clusters, elliptical galaxies, the almost

elliptical cores of spiral galaxies, and the spherical clusters of galaxies. There exist  huge

differences concerning the density of these systems: The planets and stars possess mass-density
values of the order of 1000 kg/m3,  whereas the density of the other systems extends from about
5*10-24 kg/m3 for the largest clusters of galaxies to about 4*10-18 kg/m3 for the smallest globular

star clusters as can be calculated especially from the data shown in the last figure of this

publication. These two values are much higher than the mean density of the universe with the
above mentioned value of about 5*10-28 kg/m3, but they are more than 20 orders of magnitude

lower than the corresponding values of planets and stars. As already discussed in chapter 1 the

efficiency to emit gravitational radiation may depend in an unkwown way on parameters as

density, temperature, etc. The validity of relation (8) can only be examined for systems which

are similar with respect to these parameters. In the following only the four last mentioned

systems are analysed, the two first mentioned systems, planets and stars, however, are excluded

because of the huge gap of more than 20 orders of magnitude between the values of the mean

density of these two groups from the values of the other four groups of mass accumulations.

  When considering the four largest groups mentioned above, globular star clusters, elliptical

galaxies, the almost elliptical cores of spiral galaxies, and the spherical clusters of galaxies, one

may recognize that especially all these systems contain old stars of population II, which may be

as old as the universe itself. All these systems seem to exist in a state of equilibrium since long

times, in agreement with the basic ideas of this paper.

  The mass distribution of spiral galaxies with nonspherical symmetry, with old stars of

population II in the core and young stars of population I in the spiral arms, is too complicated to

be included into the following considerations. Therefore there remain three groups of mass

accumulations which are of interest in the following: The globular star clusters, the elliptical

galaxies, and the spherical clusters of galaxies. All three systems show the typical increase of

the density towards their center in accordance with the alternative ideas in the foregoing paper

(Albers 1997). There are some more similarities between these systems which are reflected in

corresponding statements: The spherical clusters of galaxies are similar to the globular star

6

clusters (Cambridge Enzyklopädie 1989); the shape of the elliptical galaxy M87 supports the

assumption that it is a huge globular star cluster (same reference); the regular clusters of

galaxies show a density law similar to that of elliptical galaxies (Roos, N. & Norman, C.A.

1979). Thus is seems not unrealistic that these three systems may be treated by one and the

same model with its final conclusion represented by equation (8). The three systems are of very

different size, where the smallest one, the globular star clusters, are typical components of

elliptical galaxies and the elliptical galaxies themselves are the most common members in the

largest systems, the spherical clusters of galaxies. The hierarchical arrangement of these

spherical systems is not surprising because it reflects the possibility to build up stable systems

of every size at every place with sufficiently high amount and density of matter.

   For the examination of these three systems on the basis of equation (8) two values are needed,

the radius R of the system and its mass M. In data compilations usually the apparent diameters

D are specified and their original values can be used as well as the radius itself. The data may

have, however, rather large limits of error which result from the necessary observations. The

first error is due to uncertainties of the angular diameter because its determination may be

influenced by the visual magnitude of the system or by the not well known galactic extinction.

Second the distance between the system under consideration and our solar system is needed to

calculate the absolute value of the diameter in parsec. And the different methods to calibrate

distances include errors, the most commonly discussed one during the last years is the value of

Hubble ´s constant that is fundamental for the determination of the large distances to elliptical

galaxies and to the spherical clusters of galaxies. These limits of error are mentioned primarily

in order to indicate that due to the influence of the radius R on the results of equation (8) no

accuracies in the region of percents can be expected.

   The main error, however, must be expected in the second factor in equation (8), namely the

mass M, and this error is of a systematical type. The masses of all three considered systems are

usually determined by the application of the virial theorem on rotation curves or on the velocity

dispersion of particles in such systems. The elliptical systems, however, have no pronounced

rotational velocities as in the case of spiral galaxies where the values of the rotational velocities

are the basis for the determination of the radius dependent mass. The crucial point in

connection with every application of the virial theorem is the usual assumption of a universal

gravitational constant G which is valid with the same value everywhere in the universe.

   The alternative reflections on gravitation (Albers 1997) let expect that the universal

gravitational constant G, if it is used in connection with Newton`s Law of Gravitation, must be

7

replaced by a gravitational factor which is strongly dependent on the mass distribution

particularly right next to the point of consideration. Especially near the center of spherical

clusters of galaxies with their huge mass accumulations high values of the gravitational factor

must be expected according to equation (1). Thus it is not surprising that for elliptical galaxies

located in such regions extremely high mass-to-luminosity ratios M/L up to about 100 ( all

mass-to-luminosity values in this paper are given in solar units ) are calculated by the

conventional use of the virial theorem (Voigt 1982). But even higher values of M/L of about

330 ( adopting a realistic value of 75 km/s/Mpc of Hubble´s constant ) are reported from recent

measurements of the mass to light ratio of the whole Abell 2218 system which is one of the

largest spherical clusters of galaxies (Squires et al. 1996). If on the other hand mass

determinations on the basis of gravitational effects are performed in regions with no remarkable

increase of the mean density, for example in the outer part of our galaxy, quite normal values

are obtained, e.g. for the globular star cluster M22 a value M/L of about 1 applies best for the

cluster as a whole (Peterson & Cudworth 1993).

   These so determined masses of the three different systems are really not suited for an

inspection of equation (8). Instead of these masses the absolute visual magnitude may be a

better parameter, especially if one reconsiders that all three systems are composed of old stars

of population II with probably not very large differences of their mass-to-luminosity ratios.

Therefore the inspection of equation (8) will be replaced by the inspection of the  equation

                                             L / D2  = constant                                                                  (9)

with the absolute luminosity L in units of the luminosity of the sun and the diameter D in

parsec. At the end of this evaluation the data of all three systems will be changed from

luminosity to mass values using a mass-to-luminosity ratio 1. This value was already assumed

by W. Seggewiss as a realistic value for globular star clusters in the Landolt-Börnstein data

compilation (Seggewiss 1982). The value itself is of no great importance, of more interest is the

fact that one and the same value will be used for all three systems.

3. GLOBULAR STAR CLUSTERS

   Globular star clusters are very common systems in the universe. In our own galaxy, the milky

way, more than 100 of them exist which belong to the oldest objects in the universe. Their ages

with estimated values near 15 Gyr (VandenBerg, Bolte, & Stetson 1996) are as high as the age

8

of the universe determined from the value of Hubble´s constant. But also younger systems may

exist according to the own alternative reflections on gravitation. And such systems really exist;
for example in the Magellanic Clouds globular clusters with ages of only 107 to 108 yr are

observed (Unsöld & Baschek 1991). There exist also much larger groups of globular star

clusters than that in our galaxy. About 1800 candidates of the globular cluster system of the

huge elliptical galaxy NGC 4472 ( M49 ) could be investigated in detail. And this number

seems to be only 1/4 of the total number of globular clusters in this galaxy (Geisler, Lee, & Kim

1996). In the following of course only the globular clusters in our galaxy are of interest because

only for them the necessary data are known well enough.

   In the Encyclopedia of Physics (1959) data of 118 globular clusters are presented by Sawyer

Hogg on the basis of her earlier compilation (Sawyer 1947). A list with data of only 70 globular

clusters can be found in the Landolt-Börnstein data compilation (Landolt-Börnstein 1965). In

this paper, however, a more recent data compilation will be used which contains carefully

revised data and is available through the Internet. It can be found on the commercially available

CD-ROM GUIDE 4.0 and contains the detailed data presented by Ruprecht, Balazs and White

(1981) together with an extended list of references. The CD-ROM contains a machine-readable

version of a 1437 kByte file (Globular.dat) from which the relevant data were read by a basic-

program. In order to get the most reliable data all clusters were left out of consideration for

which no integral spectral type is reported in connection with the citation Sawyer Hogg and the

year 1963. In this way from the list of 137 clusters only 64 remain for which the corresponding

data exist. The globular cluster GCL-46 is omitted because no value of the linear diameter is

given, GCL-87 is neglected because of the missing data of the integrated magnitude. So there

remain 62 clusters for with the necessary values are available. The linear diameter LD in parsec

in the compilation is taken as diameter D in equation ( 9). From the integrated magnitude MT

and the distance DIST in kpc in the compilation the luminosity L is calculated according to

                            L /LSun = exp( 0.4*( mSun - MT + 10 + 5*log(DIST))). 

                       (10)

Here LSun and mSun = 4.87 mag are the luminosity and the absolute magnitude of the sun,

respectively.

   In Figure 1 the values of the luminosity L of the above mentioned 62 globular star clusters are

drawn against the linear diameter D, both in logarithmic scales. The straight line is no best fit to

the data, but it serves as a guide to the eye and its increase corresponds exactly to the power 2

9

of the dependence of L on D derived in equation (9). The scatter of the data is rather high, but it

seems that the data are not incompatible with the statement expressed by equation (9).

4. ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES

   A suitable compilation of galaxies can be obtained through the Internet from the

Astronomical Data Center ( ADC 1996). It is the electronic version of the Third Reference

Catalogue of Bright Galaxies ( RC3 ) which was compiled by de Vaucouleurs et al. ( 1991 ) and

published in printed form by the Springer-Verlag. It contains more than 23 thousand entries

from which easily those elliptical galaxies can be extracted which are of type E0 and thus of

exactly spherical form. Of course also slightly distorted elliptical galaxies of  type E1 etc. could

be taken into consideration because their deviation from the exactly spherical shape is smaller

than the probable uncertainty of other data of the E0-galaxies. The  limitation to the E0-type,

however,  restricts the selection to the really spherical systems discussed in equations (8) and

(9) and it reduces the number of galaxies to a value that can be shown graphically. The

compilation consists of the two files Rc39a and Rc39b with ascending values of  right

ascension. The search for the expression „E.0“ in the column „type“ delivers 31 galaxies from

Rc39a and 44 ones from Rc39b. Only the Rc39b data will be used in the following in order to

get not too many records.

   From the V3K-value of the escape velocity the distance d is calculated using Hubble´s

constant H with a value of 75 km/s/Mpc according to

                                                             d = V3K / H.                                                           (10)

From the log D25 value of the angular diameter the absolute diameter in pc follows by use of

the distance d. The B value of the photographic magnitude, or if missing, the total B magnitude

BT are used together with the distance d to calculate the absolute magnitude of the galaxy and

its luminosity in solar units. For 8 galaxies the necessary data about magnitude or V3K are

missing so that there remain 36 galaxies, the data of which are shown in Figure 2.

In spite of the rather large scatter of the values it may be stated that also these data seem to be

compatible with a quadratic power law, though it should be noted that most points are lying

slightly below the straight line which is a prolongation of the straight line in Figure 1 and which

represents a quadratic dependence of the luminosity L on the diameter D.

10

5. SPHERICAL CLUSTERS OF GALAXIES

   The two best known compilations of clusters of galaxies are those originally compiled by

Abell and by Zwicky which can be obtained in a modern form with revised data through the

Internet (ADC 1996). Though the number of clusters is larger in the Zwicky catalogue, the

Abell catalogue of rich, compact clusters of galaxies is the right one for this paper because the

rich clusters concentrate especially on the regular systems with spherical symmetry. Although

the data which were extracted from the Abell catalogue seemed to be suitable to support the

ideas of this paper, some other data will be used here in order to acknowledge the observations

and conclusions which were performed already by E.F. Carpenter almost 60 years ago and

which are described in the Cambridge Enzyklopädie (1989). Not all the statements of Carpenter

cited in this encyclopadia which are conform with the ideas in this paper can be reproduced

here. Besides Carpenter´s statement that there probably exists a sharp upper boundary of the

number of galaxies in dependence on the diameter of the system only his data which are shown

graphically in the above mentioned encyclopedia will be considered here. According to these

data, the number N of galaxies in a cluster is drawn against the diameter D of the cluster in

Figure 3. The straight line inserted into this figure serves as a guide to the eye and corresponds

to a quadratic dependence of N on D. The relatively large scatter of the data prevents the

selection of a special functional dependence of N on D by least squares methods. But it can also

be stated that a quadratic dependence of N on D, as represented by the straight line in Figure 3,

is a rather good fit to the data, especially if not to much significance is attached to the number N

in systems with N < 10 for which the definition of a diameter D is obviously not so easy.

   There exists no direct correlation between the ordinates in Figures 1 and 2 (luminosity L) and

the ordinate in Figure 3, the number N of galaxies. Such a correlation, however, is necessary to

combine the data of Figures 1 and 2 with the data of Figure 3. Elliptical galaxies, including

those of the E0-type in Figure 2, are the predominating components in clusters of galaxies.

Therefore it seems reasonable for a first approach to correlate the luminosity L of a cluster of

galaxies in Figure 3 to the luminosity of the E0-type galaxies in Figure 2. The mean

arithmetical value of the luminosity L of all 36 elliptical galaxies in Figure 2 is L =
1.43*1010LSun.  Assuming this value as a mean value of the N galaxies of every particular

cluster in Figure 3 one gets the luminosity values of L of the ordinate at the right side in Figure

3.

11

6. COLLECTION OF SPHERICAL OBJECTS

   The three different systems of spherical mass accumulation characterized by their data in the

Figures 1 to 3 are derived from the same basic assumptions represented by equations (8) and

(9). Therefore it should be possible to merge the data of all three systems into one figure in

which the quadratic dependence of the luminosity L on the diameter D is described by the same

value of the constant in equation (9). In Figure 4 all the data from Figures 1 to 3 are shown in

one  drawing together with a straight line which is identical with the lines in the foregoing

pictures. As can be seen from Figure 4 this line with an exactly quadratic increase of the

luminosity L on the diameter D is well suited to describe all three sytems  in the same way in

agreement with the expectations described by equation (9). Due to the enormous range in

diameter and luminosity, in this figure the deviations of the single points from the straight line

are by far not so impressive as in the foregoing figures.

   There are several causes of the large scatter of the data around the predicted straight line. First

it must be considered that the determination of data of luminosities and diameters are strongly

influenced by corrections due to the galactic extinction. This correction with values up to more

than 3 mag, e. g. for the data of globular clusters (Encyclopedia of Physics 1959), is not well

known but it can influence the luminosity values by a factor of more than ten. A second point

which should be mentioned here is the uncertainty about the determination of the distance,

especially if the value of Hubble´s constant has a decisive influence on its value. A third point

of interest in connection with Figure 4 is the  fact that the value on the right side of equation (9)

is a constant only in a first approximation. In a second approximation it should be considered

that this constant is proportional to Io and thus depending especially on the mass distribution

existing near the object of consideration. Therefore it is not surprising that the highest values of
L/D2 in Figure 1 exist for those globular star clusters which are located close to the galactic

centre, with a shortest distance of only 1.3 kpc ( here a distance of 8.5 kpc is assumed as the

distance between our solar system and the galactic centre). At such a position, already inside the

central bulge of the milky way - with a radius of about 2.5 kpc -, the value of Io can exceed

remarkably that one valid for other globular star clusters located at positions more distant from

the galactic centre.

   For the second group of objects, the elliptical galaxies of EO-type, similar systematic

corrections of the data in Figures 2 and 4 seem to be  appropriate. The two highest values of
L/D2  in Figure 2 are that of  PGC 39188 and PGC 43514, the two lowest ones belong to PGC

62122 and PGC 63852, with a factor of about ten between the highest and the lowest values. If

12

one takes a look at the drawings in URANOMETRIA 2000.0 or if one displays a region with a

diameter of 2 deg with the program GUIDE on the CD-ROM GUIDE 4.0 one can detect the

possible cause of this high factor: The diagrams centered at the first two galaxies show huge

accumulations of galaxies and clusters of galaxies whereas around the latter two galaxies such

mass accumulations are missing.

   Alltogether these three points should serve here only to show that by use of all the

experimental data presented in Figure 4 not more than a very rough correspondence with the

statements and equations of the alternative approach in this paper can be expected. Careful

corrections corresponding to these three or even more points are necessary to decide how well

the experimental data are in agreement with the postulated statements. But that is far beyond

the scope of this paper.

   A further uncertainty occurs when moving on from the luminosity data to mass data of the

objects in Figure 4. Globular star clusters and elliptical galaxies are usually characterized by

their spectral class but from this value no direct calculation of their masses is possible as  in the

case of stars by use of the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram. And the determination of the overall

mass M on the basis of the different branches of stars in globular star clusters and in elliptical

galaxies is far to awkward to be performed here. Therefore a scale for the mass M is added to

Figure 4 using a M/L ratio equal to that of our sun. As mentioned above this value M/L = 1 in

solar units was already assumed to be appropriate for globular star clusters in the Landolt-

Börnstein data compilation (Seggewiss 1982). And this value is adopted here as a realistic one

also for the other two groups of objects in Figure 4. In this way the mass-diameter relation

mentioned in the title is obtained with the expected final result that for the different spherical

systems in the universe the mass is quadratically dependent on the diameter of the system.

7. CONCLUSIONS

   On the basis of the alternative reflections on gravitation developed in the foregoing paper

(Albers 1997) it is assumed that stable spherical mass accumulations may exist in the universe.

Indeed  such objects can be observed in an incredible high number in the universe in the form

of globular star clusters, elliptical galaxies and spherical clusters of galaxies. The most simple

conclusion concerning the stability of these objects against mass-density changes by

competitive attractive and repulsive forces leads to a quadratic dependence of the masses of

these objects on their diameter. It is shown in this paper that the corresponding experimental

13

data of these objects are in agreement with this conclusion within the rather high limit of error

resulting from different sources of uncertainty. It can be noted here, however, that neither the

existence nor any parameter of these really existent stable objects can be derived on the basis of

Newtonian mechanics without the assistance of additional assumptions. A prominent example

is the process of  heating by binary stars to explain the stability of the stellar density inside

globular clusters (Guhathakurta et al.1996).

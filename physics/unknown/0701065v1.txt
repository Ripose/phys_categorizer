INTRODUCTION

The  noise  radiated  by  a  gearbox  is  due  to  the  vibrations  of  its  housing.  These  vibrations  come
from an internal excitation generated by the meshing process (static transmission error [1]). Under
operating  conditions,  this  internal  excitation  generates  a  dynamic  mesh  force  which  is  then
transmitted to the housing through the shafts and bearings.

The prediction of the dynamic behaviour of the gearbox housing needs an accurate identification
of  the  static  transmission  error  or  an  identification  of  generalized  forces  acting  on  the  housing.
However,  it  is  difficult  to  obtain  these  forces  directly  by  experimental  or  numerical  method.  The
objective  of  this  paper  is  to  develop  an  indirect  method  permitting  to  identify  the  dynamic  forces
transmitted  to  the  housing  through  bearings.  For  this  purpose,  both  numerical  simulations  and
experimental investigations will be done. The numerical method allows to compute the generalized
forces transmitted to the housing and to determine which forces are responsible for the vibrations
of  the  housing.  The  experimental  one  enables  us  to  identify  the  excitation  forces  applied  on  the
housing  from  the  measurement  of  transfer  functions  and  vibration  response  of  the  housing.  The
comparison  between  the  results  obtained  by  the  two  approaches  shows  the  effectiveness  of  the
proposed indirect force identification methodology.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GEARBOX

A single stage gearbox fitted out with a helical gear pair has been built. The main characteristics of
the gear pair are similar to those of a car gearbox (table 1). Each shaft is mounted on two tapered
roller  bearings.  The  steel  housing  (650x420x150 mm)  is  of  the  right-angled  parallelepiped  form
made  up  of  five  40 mm  thick  faces  (frame)  and  one  thin  face  (300x450 mm)  of  6 mm  thickness.
Fixed to the frame, this thin plate holds up two bearings supporting respectively the input and the
output shafts.

By  a  flexible  coupling,  a  motor  is  connected  to  the  input  shaft  which  allows  to  generate  an  input
speed  from  0  up  to  3000 rpm  and  a  torque  from  0  up  to  240 Nm.  Power  is  absorbed  by  a
generator connected to the output shaft via flexible couplings and belts. The space in front of the
6 mm thick face is free.

I. 

MODELLING  OF  THE  WHOLE  GEARBOX  AND  COMPUTATION  OF  ITS
DYNAMIC RESPONSE

The gearbox is modeled using a finite element method. The pinion and the gear are modeled with
concentrated  masses  and  rotary  inertia.  A  12x12  stiffness  matrix  is  introduced  to  couple  the  6
d.o.f. of the pinion to the 6 d.o.f. of the gear. The shafts are discretized using beam elements. The
motor and load are connected to the shafts using rotary inertia and torsion stiffness elements. The
housing  is  discretized  using  solid  elements  (40 mm  thick  faces)  and  shell  elements  (6 mm  thick
face). A 10x10 stiffness matrix is introduced to model tapered roller bearings with use of a method
described  in  [2].  The  bearings  are  discretized  using  solid  elements.  Totally,  1800  elements  and
10000 d.o.f. are used for the whole gearbox.

As  excitation  source,  only  the  transmission  error  is  retained  here,  which  can  result  from
manufacturing  errors,  tooth  modifications  and  from  periodic  mesh  stiffness.  Periodic  static
transmission error and mesh stiffness can be evaluated with help of a method described in [3].

For  a  constant  mean  speed  of  rotation,  the  equation  which  governs  vibrations  of  the  previously
discretized gearbox can be written as follows :

M  and  K  are  the  classical  mass  and  stiffness  matrix  provided  by  the  finite  element  method;  the
matrix  D  is  derived  from  geometric  characteristics  of  the  gear  pair;  k(t)  is  the  periodic  mesh
stiffness and  E(t)  is  an  equivalent  force  vector  induced  by  the  static  transmission  error.  A  modal
base  of  the  gearbox  can  be  defined  from  the  time-invariant  homogeneous  counterpart  equation.
Equation  (1)  is  solved  using  a  spectral  and  iterative  method  [4],  which  provides  a  direct  spectral
description  of  the  vibration  response  at  each  d.o.f.  and  allows  to  evaluate  simultaneously  the
dynamic mesh force, the generalized forces transmitted to the housing through the bearings and
the vibration response of the housing. For all the numerical results proposed in this paper, viscous
modal damping ratio is chosen equal to 1 % for all the natural modes.

NUMERICAL RESULTS

2.1. Generalized forces transmitted to the bearings and vibration response of the housing

From the model of the whole gearbox and the spectral and iterative method, radial forces Fx and
Fy, axial force Fz, moments Mx and My transmitted to the housing through the bearings A, B, C and
D  and  vibration  response  of  the  housing  are  calculated.  Figures 3,  4  and  5  display  the  forces  Fz
and moments Mx and My transmitted through bearings B and D against mesh frequency.

2.2 Contribution of generalized forces to the vibration response of the housing

The  vibration  response  of  the  housing  can  be  rebuilt  using  the  reciprocity  principle :  gear  and
shafts  are  suppressed  and  all  the  forces  transmitted  through  the  bearings  are  applied  on  the
empty  housing  (in  substitution  of  the  static  transmission  error).  Figure 9  shows  that  the  vibration
response  of  the  housing  calculated  with  this  method  is  identical  to  that  obtained  directly  by  the
spectral and iterative method in § 2.1.

It's  also  interesting  to  evaluate  the  relative  contribution  of  the  generalized  forces  transmitted
through bearing A, B, C and D to the vibration response of the housing. Figure 7 shows that the
vibration  response  of  the  housing  is  induced  principally  by  the  generalized  forces  transmitted
through  bearings  B  and  D  (bearings  situated  on  the  free  side  and  supported  by  the  6 mm  thick
face).  In  fact,  the  quadratic  mobility  of  the  housing  within  10-1000 Hz  is  much  higher  when  the
excitation  force  is  applied  on  the  6 mm  face  than  when  the  excitation  force  is  applied  on  the
40 mm thick face (figure 8).

The contribution of each force (Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx and My ) can also be evaluated. Figure 9 shows that
the  contribution  of  the  radial  forces  Fx  and  Fy  can  be  neglected.  In  fact,  among  the  twenty
generalized forces and moments transmitted to the housing through the bearings, the dominating
components are firstly the axial forces Fz(B) and Fz(D) and secondarily the moments Mx(B), My(B),
Mx(D) and My(D). The simulation on the time- and space-averaged mean square vibration velocity
shows the vibration response of the housing induced by these six components is almost identical
to that induced by the whole forces transmitted to the housing.

2.3 Forces calculated with a rigid housing

Vibration response of housing is usually calculated via two uncoupled stages. First, the housing is
supposed  to  be  rigid  and  the  generalized  forces  transmitted  to  the  housing  are  evaluated  by
modelling of gear and shafts. Then, the calculated forces are applied on the empty elastic housing
[5,  6]  for  computing  the  vibration  response  of  the  housing.  In  fact,  mechanical  properties  of  the
housing  modify  both  the  natural  frequencies  of  the  gearbox  and  the  transfer  functions  between
static transmission error  and  forces  transmitted  through  the  bearings.  As  shown  in  figure 13,  the
forces  transmitted  through  the  bearings  calculated  with  a  rigid  housing  are  very  different  from
those calculated with an elastic housing. With this traditional method, the vibration response of the
housing is considerably overestimated (figure 14).

In  conclusion,  the  numerical  simulation  has  confirmed  that  applying  the  generalized  forces
transmitted  through  the  bearings  on  the  empty  housing  allows  to  rebuild  the  housing  response
(reciprocity  principle).  Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  vibration  response  of  the  housing  is
induced  mainly  by  the  axial  excitation  forces,  and  secondarily  by  the  moments  Mx  and  My
transmitted on the free side (the 6 mm thick  face).  Realistic  estimation  of  these  excitation  forces
needs  the  modelling  of  the  whole  gearbox  taking  into  account  the  mechanical  properties  of  the
housing.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH

It  is  demonstrated  that  the  forces  transmitted  to  the  housing  through  the  bearings  can  be
evaluated  by  numerical  methods.  However,  in  practice,  these  forces  can’t  be  measured  directly
due  to  the  impossibility  for  introducing  force  transducers.  In  the  following,  an  inverse  approach,
which  is  based  upon  the  vibration  response  measurement  of  the  structure  and  FRF  matrix
inversion, is proposed here to identify experimentally the excitation forces.

I.

MESURING EQUIVALENT FORCES BY INVERSE METHOD

As  we  know,  the  sound  radiation  of  power  transmitting  system  is  caused  principally  by  the
vibrations of the housing of gearbox. We are only interested in the forces acting on the front plate
of the gearbox. For utilisation of the inverse approach, some hypothesis must be made.

Firstly, suppose that the vibrations of the front plate of gearbox is produced merely by the forces
transmitted to this plate through the bearings. In fact, this prototype was designed and constructed
under the guideline that the front and rear plates of gearbox are mounted on a rigid frame realised
with some welded steel plates of 40 mm’s thickness, while the front plate is 6 mm thick. Moreover,
a vibration investigation showed the vibration level of the front plate is much greater  than  that  of
the  frame  (within  the  interested  frequency  band,  the  difference  between  the  average  quadratic
velocity of the frame and that of the front plate is 20 dB).

Secondly, assume that the forces acting on the front plate can be represented by some equivalent
forces,  which  are  punctual  and  oriented  in  the  axial  direction.  Indeed,  the  previous  numerical
computation has given us evidence that the contribution of radial forces to the plate  vibrations  is
much smaller than that of the axial ones. For simplifying the measurement, the radial forces will be
ignored here.

As showed in figure 15, suppose that two groups of points are the positions of excitation forces :
one group of 3 points, distinguished by G1, G2 and G3, are situated on the bearing supporting the
driving shaft, the other group of 3 points D1, D2 and D3 are situated on the bearing supporting the
driven shaft.

Several inverse methods enable us to determine indirectly the excitation forces. Their principle can
be  found  in  [7,8,9,10].  Experimentally,  three  steps  are  necessary.  The  first  step  consists  of
determining  the  FRF  between  the  excitation  positions  and  some  response  points  chosen  on  the
reception structure, a FRF matrix is hereby established. In the second step, the excitation forces
being  applied,  the  vibration  responses  of  the  reception  structure  are  measured,  a  matrix  of
vibration  responses  can  be  constructed.  Finally,  by  inverting  the  FRF  matrix,  the  applied  forces
can be calculated.

In this article, the inverse method to be utilised is that called the inverse method of cross-spectral
matrix of vibration responses, whose principle can be expressed as follows :

For the case reported here, 12 response points are randomly selected on the plate. First, while the
gear  transmission  system  is  in  silence,  the  FRF  Acceleration/Force  between  the  6  equivalent
forces and the 12 chosen vibration responses are characterised, and this FRF characterisation is
realised by mean of a random excitation. Then, the machine is turned on, the vibration responses
on the 12 points are measured simultaneously by 12 accelerometers. Both the auto-spectra of 12
vibration responses and the cross-spectra between them are acquired. According to equation (3),
cross-spectral matrix of the equivalent forces can be finally obtained.

Two  working  cases  were  investigated.  For  one,  the  rotating  speed  is  500 rpm  and  the  loading
80 Nm, for the other, the rotating speed is 1500 rpm and the loading 160 Nm. The auto-spectra of
the 6 equivalent forces obtained by the inverse method for the two cases are given respectively in
the figures 16 and 17. With this inverse method, the cross-spectra and the coherence coefficients
between the equivalent forces are also calculable.

 DETERMING RESULTING FORCES ET MOMENTS

In  fact,  the  forces  acting  on  the  housing  through  bearings  are  some  distributed  forces
introduced  by  internal  mechanism.  Beginning  from  the  equivalent  forces  on  the  bearings
calculated  above,  in  the  following,  we’ll  represent  the  distributed  force  on  each  bearing  by  one
resulting force and one moment.

As  illustrated  in  figure 4,  on  the  surface  of
one  bearing  delimited  by  two  radius  R1  and
R2, three equivalent punctual forces, oriented
in  the  Z  direction,  are  applied.  If  at  a  given
frequency  ω  the  three  equivalent  forces  are
perfectly  coherent,  one  resulting  force  and
one moment can be used to represent them.
This resulting force, which is also oriented in
the  Z  direction  but  applied  at  the  original
point O, can be deduced by summing directly
the three forces.

In case where the three forces aren’t totally coherent, a technique called Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) must be employed to decompose the cross-spectral matrix of forces obtained
by  inverse  method,  a  series  of  principal  components  can  be  thereby  obtained  [9].  For  each
principal component, it’s necessary to determine its resulting force and moment. By summing
the energy contributions of all the principal components, the auto-spectra of the total resulting
force and moment can be evaluated.

It’s  found  experimentally  at  the  mesh  frequency,  the  excitation  forces  are  almost  perfectly

Generally  speaking,  the  agreement  between  the  results  obtained  by  numerical  method  and
those  by  the  experimental  inverse  method  is  good.  The  consideration  of  unique  excitation
source  (transmission  error)  by  the  numerical  simulation  can  explain  in  part  the  existing

CONCLUSION

In order to determine indirectly the generalized forces applied on the gearbox, two approaches are
tested,  one  is  a  numerical  method,  the  other  is  experimental.  For  the  numerical  method,  the
vibration  response  of  the  gearbox  can  be  evaluated  with  use  of  a  finite  element  analysis  and  a
spectral  and  iterative  method.  It’s  confirmed  that  applying  the  generalized  forces  transmitted
through  the  bearings  on  the  empty  housing  allows  to  rebuild  the  housing  response  (reciprocity
principle). The simulation on the time- and space-averaged mean square vibration velocity shows
the  vibration  response  of  the  housing  is  induced  principally  by  the  axial  exciting  forces,  and
secondarily  by  the  moments  Mx  and  My.  transmitted  on  the  free  side  (the  6 mm  thick  face).
Realistic estimation of these excitation forces needs a modelling of the whole gearbox taking into
account the mechanical properties of the housing.

For  the  experimental  approach,  an  inverse  method  based  upon  the  FRF  measurement  and
characterisation of gearbox vibration response is developed. Beginning from the equivalent forces
obtained by this inverse method, a resulting force and a moment are derived for representing the
distributed force  acting  on  each  bearing.  The  comparison  between  the  results  obtained  by  these
two methods shows the effectiveness of this indirect force determination methodology.

RESUME

Le  bruit  engendré  par  le  fonctionnement  d’une  transmission  par  engrenages  est  principalement
induit par les vibrations de son carter. Ces vibrations ont pour origine principale l’erreur statique de
transmission sous charge qui se traduit par une fluctuation des efforts s’exerçant sur les dents en
prise.  Par  le  corps  des  engrenages,  les  arbres  et  les  paliers,  ces  excitations  sont  transmises  au
carter et l’excitent en vibration. En raison de la complexité de la structure, en général, l’observation
directe de ces excitations par capteurs de force est impossible.

Deux  approches  sont  proposées  dans  cette  communication  pour  évaluer  ces  efforts,  l’une  est
basée sur un modèle par éléments finis et l’autre expérimentale.

Pour l’approche “calcul numérique”, une modélisation intégrant l’ensemble des composants de la
transmission (engrenages,  lignes  d’arbres,  roulement,  carter  et  environnement)  permet  d’évaluer
le transfert entre l’effort dynamique de denture et les efforts dynamiques transmis au carter par les
roulements.  Il  est  donc  possible  de  connaître  à  partir  de  l’erreur  statique  de  transmission  sous
charge les efforts généralisés transmis au carter par les paliers. Par cette approche numérique on
peut  également  calculer  la  réponse  vibratoire  de  la  transmission  complète  et  évaluer  la
contribution de chaque effort généralisé.

L’approche expérimentale utilise des méthodes inverses qui permettent de déterminer sur chaque
palier des efforts équivalents induits par le roulement de l’arbre. L’expérimentation des méthodes
inverses  consiste  d’abord  à  déterminer,  machine  au  repos,  les  fonctions  de  transfert  entre  les
points d’excitation et des points de réponse vibratoire sur le carter. Dans un deuxième temps, la
machine  étant  en  fonctionnement,  on  relève  les  réponses  vibratoires  aux  points  de  réponse
choisis. Par inversion de la matrice des fonctions de transfert, les excitations recherchées peuvent
enfin  être  calculées.  A  partir  des  efforts  équivalents  obtenus,  un  effort  et  un  moment  résultants
peuvent être quantifiés sur chaque boîtier de roulement.

Les deux approches proposées sont appliquées sur un banc d’essais des transmissions construit
dans  le  cadre  des  activités  du  Club  Transsil.  L’analyse  des  résultats  produits  par  l’approche
expérimentale et la prédiction théorique a permis de vérifier la validé de ces deux approches et de
démontrer la faisabilité d’une méthodologie visant à déterminer indirectement les efforts appliqués
sur les carters des transmissions par engrenages.

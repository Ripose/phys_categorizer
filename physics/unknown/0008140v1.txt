Abstract

The  Radio-Frequency  Quadrupole  (RFQ)  linac  that
will    accelerate  a  20mA  proton  beam  from  50keV  to
3MeV has  been designed  and is  being fabricated  as  the
first  phase,  KOMAC  Test  Facility  (KTF),  of  the  Korea
Multipurpose Accelerator Complex (KOMAC) project at
the  Korea  Atomic  Energy  Research  Institute  (KAERI).
The physical,  engineering designs and fabrication status
of the RFQ are described.

1  INTRODUCTION

The linear accelerator for the KOMAC Project [1] will
include  a  3MeV,  350MHz  cw  RFQ 
linac.  The
KOMAC/KTF RFQ [2,3] concept is shown in Fig. 1 with
the  main  parameters  given  in  table  1.  The  KTF  RFQ
bunches,  focuses,  and  accelerates  the  50keV  H+/H-
beams and derives a 3.0MeV beam at its exit. The RFQ
is a 324cm-long, 4-vanes type and consists of 56 tuners,
16  vacuum  ports,  1  coupling  plate,  4  rf  drive  couplers,
96  cooling  passages,  and  8  stabiliser  rods.  The  RFQ  is
machined into OFH-Copper, will be integrated from four
separate  81cm-long  sections  which  are  constructed  by
using vacuum furnace  brazing. RF power  is supplied  to
the  RFQ  which  operates  at  100%  duty-factor  by  one
klystron of 1MW.

The physics and engineering design study of the KTF
RFQ linac are presented in section 2. Section 3 describes
the  450keV  RFQ  which

development of  the  KTF  RFQ  linac.  Section  4  presents
the present status of the KTF RFQ.

2.1  Cavity Design

    The design of the 3MeV RFQ has been completed. In
the  KTF  RFQ  design,  a  main  issue  is  to  accelerate  the
mixing H+/H- beam at the same time. The motion of the
mixing  H+/H-  beam  into  the  RFQ  has  been  studied  by
using a time marching beam dynamics code, QLASSI[4].
Fig.  2  shows  that  the  longitudinal  beam  loss  increases
with the concentration of negative ions by the bunching
process which is distributed by attractive forces when the
mixing  ratio  of  H-  is  more  than  30%.  The  transverse
beam  loss  decreases  with  the  mixing  ratio  of  H- by  the
space charge compensation in the low energy sections.

between  the  theoretical  model  of  the  RFQ  and  the  real
device built. This power is delivered by a single klystron,
capable  of  1MW.  The  350MHz  klystron  and  RF
windows  will  be  supplied  by  Thomson  Co.  Ltd.  The
power is coupled in the cavity with a set of four coupling
loops. Each port will therefore carry an average rf power
of 120kW.

2.3  Cold Model

    In  order  to  test  the  fabrication  accuracy  and  validate
the  simulation  studies  which  were  performed  by
PARMTEQM[5],  VANES,  SUPERFISH,  MAFIA,
ANSYS codes, a full  size 324cm-long RFQ cold  model
was made of aluminium as shown in Fig. 3. Though this
model does not operate with rf power and under vacuum
pumping,  it  has  rf  power  coupling  ports,  tuner  ports,
stabilizer  rod,  coupling  plate,  end  plates,  and  vacuum
ports which are  given by  the 3-dim  drawing. By  tuning
the  undercut  depth  and  end  plates,  we  obtained  the
optimum vane-end geometry and the required 350 MHz
resonant frequency.

the  vane  during  CW  operation, 

   The average RFQ cavity structure power by rf thermal
loads is 0.35 MW and the peak surface heat flux on the
cavity  wall  is  0.13  MW/m2  at  the  high  energy  end.  In
order  to  remove  this  heat,  we  consider  24  longitudinal
coolant passages in each of the sections. In the design of
the  coolant  passages,  we  considered 
thermal
behaviour  of 
the
efficiency  of  cooling  and  fabricating  cost.  The  thermal
and structure analysis was studied with the ANSYS code.
Because of the flow erosion of the coolant passages, we
considered  the  maximum  allowable  velocity  of  the
normal  coolant  as  4m/sec.  From  the  thermal-structural
analysis of ANSYS, the  peak temperature on the  cavity
wall is 51.4  oC, the maximum displacement is 42m m and
the  intensity  stress  is  13MPa.  The  temperature  of  the
coolants on the cavity wall  varies to maintain the cavity
on the resonance frequency.

2.2  RF Power System

    The total power simulated is 418kW, including beam
loading and power dissipation by a cavity wall, when an
additional 50% of the power is allowed as the difference

3  0.45MeV TEST RFQ

A 450keV test RFQ has been designed and fabricated
to understand the construction process, cooling, control,
rf drive system, and beam diagnostic techniques. Design
of  the  RFQ  was  done  by  KAERI  and  POSTECH,  and
fabrication was done at Dae-Ung Engineering Company
and VITZRO TECH Co., Ltd.

 Fig. 4 shows a 96.4cm long 0.45MeV RFQ which was
brazed in  a  vacuum  furnace.  The  RFQ  was  brazed  in  a
vertical  orientation  with  LUCAS  BVag-8,  AgCu  alloy
with a liquid temperature of 780  oC. The four quadrants
of the RFQ have been fabricated separately and brazed.
Thus the RFQ is the completed monolithic structure and
the vanes are permanently aligned. This structure serves
to  mitigate  the  cost  and  to  simplify  the  mechanical
support system. Because of the leak of a brazing surface
and the strain of the RFQ structure by the furnace heat, it
is  important  to  determine  the  appropriate  shape  of  the

brazing  area.  To  determine  the  appropriate  shape,  we
have performed two brazing tests. Testing of the brazed
RFQ showed it to be leak-tight. The coolant passages in
the cavity wall and vane  area was the deep-hole  drilled
and  was brazed in a vacuum furnace.

 4  PRESENT STATUS

    The design of the 3MeV RFQ has been completed. The
cold  model  with  aluminium  has  been  fabricated  and
tested. The 3MeV RFQ with OFHC is being fabricated.
As  a  test  bed  for  3MeV  RFQ,  the  design,  construction,
electrical  test,  and  vacuum  test  of  the  0.45MeV  RFQ
have been finished. The rf tuner has been fabricated and
was tested.

  The frequency and unloaded Q was measured with a
network analyzer in atmosphere, i.e. not under a vacuum.
Without  tuning,  the  measured  frequency  and  Q  were
349.63MHz and 5300 by  observing the 1dB  bandwidth,
respectively.

tune  the  cavity  to  the  operating  frequency.  By  moving
four  tuners  to  a  2.5cm  inserted  position,  a  total  tuning
range of 2.5MHz was measured.

    The KTF RFQ has a rectangular undercut of the vanes.
The  exact  dimension  of 
the  undercut  has  been
determined  empirically  by  cutting  a  vane  which  was
fabricated into the OFHC. Fig. 6 shows the variation of
the resonant frequency versus the depth of the undercut.
The  resonant  frequency  of  the  RFQ  cavity  inversely
decreases  with  undercut  depth.  To  maximise  the  effect
of  the  stabilizer  rod,  we  determined  that  the  undercut
depth and vane to end-plate length are 28mm and 35mm,
respectively. 
the  quadrupole-dipole
separation was 10MHz.

  Abstract 

Presented is intuitive proof of Black-Scholes formula for European call options, 
which is based on arbitrage and properties of lognormal distribution. Paper can 
help students and non-mathematicians to better understand economic concepts 
behind one of the biggest achievements in modern financial theory.

Introduction 

Traditional  derivation  of  Black-Scholes  formula  [1]  requires  employment  of  stochastic 
differential  equations  and  Ito  calculus.  It  makes  this  subject  pretty  challenging  for 
students  and  people  not  fluent  in  those  advanced  mathematical  subjects.  Current  article 
shows deduction of Black-Scholes formula based purely on the concept of arbitrage and 
properties of lognormal distributions.

  Concept of Arbitrage

Why? Because if

Concept of arbitrage says that when the future price of investment asset is unknown it is 
assumed that the price of asset today with its delivery in the future is determined by some 
other asset whose future price is deterministic. 
 
Let me show how concept of arbitrage works with the price of non-dividend-paying stock 
share. Assume that at time 
. We want to determine 
 the price of share is 
t

Now I assume that we have another investment asset whose price is deterministic in the 
r

in bank at time 
 she can take back from bank at time 
 the amount of cash equal to

 the amount of cash equal to 

 she have to give back to bank at time

 the 

amount of cash equal to

 i.e.

Probabilistic Nature of Options 

Stock options represent the right of investors to  buy the shares of stock in the future  at 
predetermined price. Thus for example the price of European call options today depicts 
the future prices of stock shares multiplied by probability that the price of shares exceeds 
this predetermined price (so-called strike price). And that probability obviously depends 
on  the  stock  volatility.  Therefore  if  stock  is  more  volatile  it  gives  one  bigger  profitable 
opportunities to exercise her right to buy stock shares at the predetermined price. 
 
But we are unaware of the future prices of stock shares, aren’t we? Yes, but we employ 
the concept of arbitrage, which says since the future prices of stock shares are unknown 
market assumes that their prices today are determined by another asset with deterministic 
future prices as for example the bank account paying a continuous interest rate 
 
So  the  problem  is  only  with  choice  of  assumptions  regarding  to  the  volatility  of  stock 
shares.  Academics  have  studied  stock  prices  observed  by  the  market  and  decided  that 
their  probabilistic  behavior  is  well  approximated  by  the  lognormal  distribution  [2]  (i.e. 
logarithm of stock prices is approximately normally distributed).

Summary 

Article  demonstrates  that  in  order  to  get  Black-Scholes  formula  for  calculation  of  the 
price for European call options it is sufficient for one to use logic based on a number of 
assumptions where some assumptions have a firm economic nature and another ones are 
purely probabilistic assumptions. 
 
Principal economic assumption says when future prices of investment asset are unknown 
market assumes that the price of asset today with its delivery in the future is determined 
by another asset such as a bank account whose future prices are deterministic. 
 
Probabilistic  assumptions  say  when  future  prices  of  such  investment  asset  as  shares  of 
non-dividend-paying stock are unknown market assumes that the prices of stock shares at 
the  end  of  investment  period  will  have  lognormal  distribution  and  that  volatility  of  the 
prices  of  stock  shares  can  be  explained  by  the  variance  of  logarithm  of  prices  that  is 
directly proportional to the length of investment period. 
 
Logic besides assembling assumptions above into Black-Scholes formula is as following. 
Market  assumes  today  that  the  price  of  stock  shares  in  the  future  is  determined  by  the 
growth of  cash investments in bank accounts. Stock option is a right of investor to buy 
the  shares  of  stock  in  the  future  at  predetermined  price.  Thus  today  market  anticipates 
that at the end of investment period monetary value of European call options will become 
equal to the expected positive cash surplus between possible prices of stock shares and 
their predetermined price. The expected surplus between possible prices of stock shares 
and the predetermined price of stock shares is calculated based on the volatility of prices 
of stock shares around the expected price of stock shares at the end of investment period. 
In turn the expected surplus between prices of stock shares and the predetermined price 
of them reveals how market anticipates today cash value of  European call option at the 
end  of  investment  period.  And  to  obtain  today’s  price  of  European  call  option  on  the 
market  from  cash  value  of  European  call  option  at  the  end  of  investment  period  (since 
exact value growth of the investment asset like European call option is unknown) market 
uses  the  same  economic  mechanism  as  it  employs  in  bringing  the  future  values  of  cash 
investments in bank accounts to their today’s value i.e. in other words market discounts 
value of European call option as future cash value in bank accounts to today’s cash value. 
 
Thus  discount  of  the  expected  positive  surplus  between  possible  prices  of  stock  shares 
and  their  predetermined  price  with  help  of  continuous  interest  rate  over  the  length  of 
investment period finally produces the Black-Scholes formula for European call options.

Abstract A hierarchical approach to the construction of compound distributions for process-induced
faults in IC manufacture is proposed. Within this framework, the negative binomial distribution and
the compound binomial distribution are treated as level-1 models. The hierarchical approach to fault
distribution offers an integrated picture of how fault density varies from region to region within a
wafer,  from  wafer  to  wafer  within  a  batch,  and  so  on.  A  theory  of  compound-distribution
hierarchies is developed by means of generating functions. With respect to applications, hierarchies
of yield means and yield probability-density functions are considered and an in-process measure of
yield loss is introduced. It is shown that the hierarchical approach naturally embraces the Bayesian
approach.

1. INTRODUCTION
into
As  early  as 
microelectronics,  having  found  that  the  traditional  Poisson  distribution  is  not  always  adequate  to
predict yield in integrated-circuit (IC) manufacture. The point is that process-induced faults tend to
occur unevenly over the wafer, appearing as clusters. Murphy's approach was developed by Seeds
[2], Okabe et al. [3], Stapper [4, 5], and other researchers.
The  compound  Poisson  distribution  differs  from  the  traditional  one  in  that  the  parameter  λ
denoting  the  fault  density  is  regarded  as  a  random  variable.  Experience  indicates  that  the  gamma
distribution  is  probably  the  most  accurate  model  for  λ [6--10].  Also  note  that  the  compound
Poisson  distribution  is  a  limiting  case  of  the  compound  binomial  distribution,  the  latter  arising
within Polya's urn model [11].
Statistical  yield  models  based  on  compound  distributions  have  proven  to  be  useful  in  design,
manufacture,  and  product  evaluation  alike.  Yield  enhancement  aims  to  make  the  product  fault-
tolerant (i.e., less sensitive to process-induced faults) by adding a degree of redundancy to the IC
(error-correcting  codes  are  an  example)  and  by  optimizing  its  floorplan  and  layout  [12--18].
Concerning the manufacture phase, we cite the Bayesian approach. Applied to in-process product
control, the method allows one to refine yield prediction and make decisions as the batches progress
along  the  processing  line  [19].  Compound-distribution  models  also  help  one  to  calculate  yield
distribution  over  wafers,  to  estimate  costs,  to  evaluate  manufacturing  efficiency,  to  predict  yield
losses, etc. [20, 21].
In  this  study,  we  propose  and  develop  a  hierarchical  approach  to  the  construction  of  compound
distributions for process-induced faults in IC manufacture.
Section  2  describes  the  origin  and  main  properties  of  a  yield  model  that  is  built  around  the
compound Poisson distribution and has been accepted by the electronics industry [17].
Section  3  defines  the  compound  binomial  distribution  and  describes  some  of  its  properties.  This
model includes the compound Poisson distribution as a limiting case in much the same way as the
traditional binomial distribution leads to the Poisson distribution. The reader is also introduced to
Polya's urn model, within which the compound binomial distribution arises.

Section  4  develops  a  theory  of  compound-distribution  hierarchies.  Within  this  framework,  the
above-mentioned distributions belong to level 0 or 1. It is shown that main formulae can be written
in compact analytical form by means of generating functions.
Section 5 deals with applied aspects. Compared with previous results, a more general formalism for
mean yields  is  presented.  Also included  are  equations  for  yield  probability  densities.  The  yield  is
thus treated as a hierarchical random variable.
Appendices 1 and 2 are concerned with a generalization of Polya's urn model and with the Bayesian
approach to the estimation of fault density, respectively.

2. COMPOUND POISSON DISTRIBUTION
Primitive yield models employ the binomial distribution. Consider a chip with  n components. If
each  of  them  has  the  same  probability  p of  being  faulty  and  faults  arise  independently  of  one

Since  n is very large and  p is very small, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a
Poisson  distribution  to  a  good  accuracy.  Accordingly,  with  λ   denoting  np (the  expected
value of  k ), the probability

Assume  that  the  chips  have  no  redundancy,  so  that  any  faulty  component  will  make  the  chip
nonconforming. Then, the yield  Y  is equal to the probability that a randomly chosen chip is fault-
free:
Y
However,  it  was  found  as  early  as  in  1964  that  Eq.  (3)  makes  badly  pessimistic  predictions  if
applied to large-area chips [1]. The underlying reason, as was revealed later, is that process-induced
faults do not arise independently in different regions of the wafer but tend to cluster.
To  allow  for  fault  clustering,  the  compound  Poisson  distribution  was  introduced,  in  which  the
expected  number  of  faults  per  chip,  λ ,  is  also  a  random  variable.  Let

The model considered is known as the large-area clustering negative binomial model [13, 15]. The
parameter a  is called the cluster parameter. Its typical values approximately range from 0.3 to 7. In
actual  fact,  fault  clustering  disappears  if  a   exceeds  4  or  5;  for  such  a ,  Eq.  (17)  can  be
approximated by formula (3).
The  large-area  clustering  model  is  based  on  two  assumptions.  First,  fault  clusters  are  larger  than
chips, so that any faulty chip is totally covered by one fault cluster. Second, faults are distributed
uniformly within any cluster.
In addition, there are the small-area clustering negative binomial model [24] and the medium-area
clustering  negative  binomial  model  [25,  26].  The  latter  is  regarded  as  including  the  other  models
[13]. It is intended for chips with areas on the order of a square inch; they may well be larger than
fault clusters. Since the concept of fault cluster has yet to be clarified, the medium-area clustering
model is defined in terms of blocks [25]. It is assumed that (i) correlation between faults may exist
only within a block, (ii) blocks are statistically independent of each other, (iii) the total number of
faults  per  block  obeys  a  negative  binomial  distribution,  and  (iv)  faults  are  distributed  uniformly
over each block.

3. COMPOUND BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION AND POLYA'S URN MODEL
By analogy with the compound Poisson distribution, let us apply the compounding procedure to the
binomial distribution. The result might be called the compound binomial distribution.
3.1 Compound Binomial Distribution: Definition and Properties
Consider a population of good and faulty items in which the latter ones account for the proportion
θ, with the faults distributed randomly over the population. Let us take a sample of size n . The
total number k of faulty items in the sample is a random variable obeying a binomial distribution
with the probability mass function (PMF)

3.2 Polya's Urn Model
The compound binomial distribution can be obtained by a certain probabilistic algorithm in much
the same way as the traditional binomial distribution is produced by Bernoulli trials. The algorithm
is known as Polya's urn model. It was proposed by a Hungarian-born US mathematician in 1923 as
a means of describing epidemics and similar phenomena, allowing for aftereffects [11, 27].
Polya's urn model is defined as follows. Consider an urn that initially contains a black and b  white
balls.  In  the  microelectronics  context,  white  and  black  balls  might  represent  good  and  faulty  IC
components, respectively.
Let us repeat the following procedure continually at equal intervals:
(i) Withdraw a ball at random from the urn.
(ii) Identify the color of the ball.
(iii) Return the ball to the urn.
(iv) Add a ball of the same color to the urn.
Thus,  the  total  number  of  balls  in  the  urn  steadily  increases.  For  each  cycle,  the  probability  of
retrieving a ball of given color depends on the current numbers of black and white balls in the urn.
In the first cycle the probability  p of taking a black ball is

Polya's urn model allows us to put a microelectronics interpretation on the parameters a  and  b  of
a gamma or a beta distribution. The parameter  b  (the initial number of white balls) can be seen as
the  size  of  the  fault-free  part.  With  a  compound  binomial  distribution  or  a  compound  Poisson
distribution,  the  size  is  measured  by  the  total  number  of  good  chip  components  or  good  chips,

4. COMPOUND-DISTRIBUTION HIERARCHIES
Using generating functions, one can visually construct a hierarchy of compound distributions that
represents  the  multilevel  nature  of  fault  clustering.  We  start  with  the  generating  function  of  a
binomial  distribution,  which  should  be  regarded  as  a  compound  distribution  of  level  0.  Then  we
explicitly construct levels 1 and 2. Finally, we generalize the results to an arbitrary level.

Table  1  indicates  that  hierarchical  clustering  models  predict  a  higher  yield  than  simple  Poisson
models.  At  the  same  time,  the  former  distributions  show  longer  tails.  Numerical  calculations
demonstrate that compound Poisson distributions lead to estimates very close to those obtained by
more laborious manipulations on the basis of compound binomial distributions (see Eqs. (22) and
(44)).

of yield, F(Yr), using Eq. (66) [20, 21]. The CDF is expressed by means of incomplete gamma
function as

Figure 2 illustrates the approach in the case of intolerable yield loss. The solid and the broken curve
depict  a  specified  and  an  actual  CDF,  respectively.  The  yield  and  yield  loss  are  measured  by  the
areas of the corresponding parts of the square: the part to the right of the specified curve refers to
the specified yield loss, the part to the left of the actual curve represents the actual yield, and the
part between the actual and the specified curve indicates the excess yield loss. The process should
be controlled in such a way that the actual curve mostly go below the specified one. It is convenient
to measure the statistical significance of excess yield loss by the Kolmogorov statistic D+

6. CONCLUSIONS
We have developed a general approach to the construction of compound distributions for process-
induced faults in IC manufacture. It quantifies the performance of a process in hierarchical form and
helps one build general statistical models for fault control and yield management. With the aid of
generating  functions,  main  results  can  be  written  in  compact  analytical  form.  The  strategy  covers
the negative binomial distribution and the compound binomial distribution, regarding them as level-
1 models. (The latter distribution arises within Polya's urn model.)
The  hierarchical  approach  to  fault  distribution  offers  an  integrated  picture  of  how  fault  density
varies from area to area within a wafer, from wafer to wafer within a batch, and so on. The average
fault density and the clustering factor can be estimated from an expansion of the variance in terms
of hierarchy levels.

Yield  hierarchies  provide  a  new,  general  formalism  for  yield  estimation  and  prediction  in  IC
manufacture,  treating  the  yield  as  a  random  variable.  Particular  cases  are  the  Poisson  distribution
(level-0 model) and the negative binomial distribution (level-1 model).
The  in-process  measure  of  yield  loss  proposed  in  this  study  might  be  useful  for  setting  standards
and implementing statistical process control in real time.
Finally, two points are worth making:
(i)  Polya's  urn  model  can  be  generalized  to  the  case  of  noninteger  parameters  and  an  arbitrary
number of hierarchy levels (see Appendix 1).
(ii)  The  hierarchical  approach  to  fault  distribution  naturally  embraces  the  Bayesian  approach  (see
Appendix 2).

APPENDIX 1: A GENERALIZATION OF POLYA'S URN MODEL
In this appendix we put forward a generalization of Polya's urn model that (i) permits  a  and  b
to take noninteger values and (ii) naturally leads to the  distribution hierarchy. This generalization
might be called the sandbox model.
Consider  a  sandbox  that  initially  contains  a   cups  of  dark-colored  sand  and  b   cups  of  light-
colored sand. The two types of sand are thoroughly mixed, and their grains are of the same size.
Let us perform this Procedure:
(i) Take a grain at random from the sandbox.
(ii) Identify the color of the grain.
(iii) Add a cup of sand of the same color to the sandbox.
(iv) Stir the sand in the sandbox.

Bogdanov at al. Russian Microelectronics, 2003, V. 32, №1, P.51.

After  each  cycle,  the  proportion  p   of  dark  sand  in  the  sandbox  is  a  random  variable.  Its
distribution  will  approach  the  beta  distribution  with  parameters  a   and  b   if  the  Procedure  is
repeated  indefinitely.  Effectively,  we  deal  with  a  population  of  sandboxes  whose  states  are
quantified by  p . During a sufficiently large number of cycles, the sandboxes will evolve from
the  same  initial  state,  characterized  by  a   and  b ,  to  different  final  states  obeying  the  beta
distribution  with  the  parameters  a   and  b   (see  Subsection  3.2).  A  uniform  population  of
sandboxes has thus become randomly nonuniform in  p  according to the beta distribution. On the
other hand, if we take a sample of  n  from each sandbox, the samples will make up a population
with the same distribution as that produced by Polya's urn model.
Let us now construct a distribution hierarchy with levels 0, 1, 2, …,  l , starting from level  l . For
lb  cups of
this level, we have a population of sandboxes each of which initially contains 
dark and light sand, respectively. To this population, we continually apply the Procedure until  p

Level 
 is formed as follows. From each sandbox, let us take a number of samples of the
same size. Any two samples have the same  p  if they correspond to the same sandbox. However,
p  varies randomly from sample to sample according to the beta distribution if no two samples
considered  are  taken  from  the  same  sandbox.  Let  us  regard  each  sample  as  a  sandbox  of  level
1−l
  cups  of  dark  sand  and 
  cups  of  light  sand.  To  each
sandbox population uniform in  p , we continually apply the Procedure until  p  attains the beta
1−lb
distribution with the parameters 
The lower levels are created in the same way. The point is that, at each level higher than level 0, we
transform  a  sandbox  population  uniform  in  p   into  a  randomly  nonuniform  one,  which  is
characterized by a beta distribution. At level 0, we simply take samples of the same size from the
sandboxes of level 1.
Let  us  put  a  microelectronic  interpretation  on  the  above  hierarchy.  Level  0  corresponds  to  chips
within  a  block,  i.e.,  a  uniform  region  on  the  wafer.  For  any  block,  the  yield  is  modeled  by  the
binomial distribution with an appropriate  p . Level 1 corresponds to blocks within a wafer. The
beta  distribution  of  this  level  governs  the  random  fault  variability  from  block  to  block.  Level  2
represents the fault variability from wafer to wafer within a batch. Level 3 describes the variability
from batch to batch within a group of batches, and so on.

APPENDIX 2: INCORPORATING THE BAYESIAN APPROACH
Below  we  demonstrate  that  the  formalism  developed  in  this  work  can  naturally  incorporate  the
Bayesian approach as an efficient method for improving statistical estimates [19]. Consider a wafer
regarded  as  consisting  of  n -component  blocks.  The  total  number  k   of  faulty  components  in  a
  and
block  is  a  random  variable  whose  distribution  changes  from  block  to  block.  Let

  be  respective  estimates  of  the  expected  value  and  variance  for  k .  If  there  is
considerable clustering, then 
. If faults obey a beta distribution, its parameters
a   and  b   can  be  estimated  from  Eqs.  (25)  and  (26).  If  the  difference  between  the  mean  and
variance is not statistically significant, we can infer that  a  and  b  are indefinitely large and the
compound (binomial or Poisson) distribution turns into a pure one. This implies that the wafer is of
uniform  fault  density  and  can  be  regarded  as  a  single  block,  with  the  fault  density  estimated  by
taking  the  ratio  of  the  total  number  of  faults  to  the  total  number  of  components;  otherwise,  the
blocks have to be treated individually.
Bayes' Theorem enables one to improve the estimation of fault density for each block, provided that
the data on the fault count for the block are used in conjunction with the parameters  a  and  b  of
the  interblock  fault  distribution.  Specifically,  the  fault  density  θ   of  a  block  is  regarded  as  a
random variable whose PDF is calculated from

This approach leads to the following result. Let the random variability of θ  from block to block
within the wafer obey the beta distribution with parameters  a  and  b  (a prior distribution). Then
the  distribution  of  θ   for  an  n -component  block  with  k   faulty  components  is  the  beta

The above statement can easily be proven within Polya's urn model (see Eq. (27)).

Abstract   

We  have  used  kinetic  Monte  Carlo  simulations  to  study  the  kinetics  of  unfolding  of 

cross-linked polymer chains under mechanical loading. As the ends of a chain are pulled 

apart,  the  force  transmitted  by  each  crosslink  increases  until  it  ruptures.  The  stochastic 

crosslink  rupture  process  is  assumed  to  be  governed  by  first  order  kinetics  with  a  rate 

that  depends  exponentially  on  the  transmitted  force.  We  have  performed  random 

searches  to  identify  optimal  crosslink  configurations  whose  unfolding  requires  a  large 

applied  force  (measure  of  strength)  and/or  large  dissipated  energy  (measure  of 

toughness).  We  found  that  such  optimal  chains  always  involve  cross-links  arranged to 

form  parallel  strands.  T he  location  of  those  optimal  strands  generally  depends  on  the 

loading rate. Optimal chains with a small number of cross-links were found to be  almost 

as strong and tough as optimal chains with a large number of cross-links. Furthermore, 

optimality  of  chains  with  a  small  number  of  cross -links  can  be  easily  destroyed  by 

adding cross-links at random.  The present  findings are relevant for the interpretation of 

single molecule  force probe spectroscopy studies of the  mechanical  unfolding  of  “load-

bearing”  proteins,  whose  native  topology  often  involves  parallel  strand  arrangements  

similar to the optimal configurations identified in the study.

1. Introduction  

A  number  of  proteins  exhibit  a  combination  of  strength  and  toughness  that 

cannot  be  matched  by  artificial  materials1-4.  Recent  single  molecule  force  probe 

spectroscopy  experiments  suggest  that  these  remarkable  properties  are  accomplished 

through  the  mechanical  response  of  individual  protein  domains,  which  are  capable  of  

dissipating large energy  upon their mechanical unfolding2,4,5.   

In single molecule pulling experiments employing the atomic force microscope 

(AFM),  one end of the protein  is attached to a substrate  and the other end is attached to 

a  cantilever(see, e.g., refs.  6-8  for  a  review);  The  cantilever  then  can  be  displaced  at  a 

constant  rate.  During  such  an  experiment,  one  measures  the  pulling  force,  and  then 

presents the data in the form of the force -displacement curve.  The forces generated by 

different proteins under typical experimental conditions range from a few piconewtons 

to several hundred piconewtons and generally depend on the pulling rate.  If one were to 

perform an equilibrium, reversible stretching experiment by pulling  on the molecule at a 

sufficiently  slow rate then the measured force-vs-displacement curve  would become rate 

independent and the work done by the pulling force would be equal to the free energy 

difference  between  the  folded  and  the  stretched  states  of  the  molecule.  In  practice, 

stretching of a molecule is nearly an equilibrium process if the time  scale  of  pulling  is 

longer  than  that  of  the  molecule’s  conformational  changes.  This  equilibrium  regime  is 

rarely  achieved  in  AFM  pulling  studies.  It  further  appears  that  many  proteins  that 

perform  “load-bearing”  functions 

in 

living  organisms  operate  far  away  from 

 

3 

equilibrium;  as  a  result  their  mechanical  stability  is  often  uncorrelated  with  their 

thermodynamic stability7,9-12.     

For  example,  the  work  required  to  unfold  the  molecule  of  the  muscle  protein 

titin in a typical AFM pulling experiment is about two orders of magnitude higher than 

its  free  energy  of  folding,  indicating  that  this  is  a  highly  nonequilibrium  process5. This 

property  accounts  for  the  high  toughness  of  titin  arguably  required  for  its  biological 

function in the muscles. Similarly, the  difference between the force-vs.-extension curves 

measured  in  the  course  of  stretching  and  subsequent  relaxation  of  spider  capture  silk 

proteins4  reveals  that  stretching  is  a non-equilibrium  process,  in  whic h  extra  energy  is 

dissipated. In contrast, the work required to unfold  of the myosin coiled-coil via pulling 

on it at similar pulling rates is comparable to the free energy of folding, indicating that 

this is a nearly equilibrium process5.     

   

The mechanical resistance of  a  protein  is  thus  determined both  by  its structure 

and  by  the  loading  rate.  Recently,  we  have  studied  a  toy  model  of  a  cross-linked 

polymer  chain, which we used to identify the  chain configurations  that  lead  to  its  high 

mechanical resistance13. In that model, we considered a Gaussian chain  with rigid cross-

links. Unfolding  of  the  chain  under  mechanical  loading  occurs  as  a  result  of  rupture  of 

the cross-links. Each cross-link  ruptures  once  its  internal force reaches a critical value. 

Thus, as  the chain  ends are being pulled apart at a constant rate,  the force in  each  link 

increases until it ruptures. As the loading proceeds, all  the crosslinks become ruptured 

and the chain unfolds. The excess work  done  on  the cross-linked chain,  as compared to 

 

4 

the work done stretching the unconstrained  chain,  is  a  measure  of the chain toughness. 

Given  the  total  number  of  cross-links ,  one  may  seek  the  optimal  cross-link 

configurations that maximize either the excess work  or  the maximum force  during the  

unfolding  process.  Our  rationale  for  studying  such  a  simple  model  was  the  previous 

finding7,10-12,14  that  the  unfolding  mechanism  is  largely  determined  by  the  native 

topology of the protein.  This view is further supported by the success of simplified, Go-

like  models  in  predicting  the  mechanisms  of  mechanical  unfolding15-18.  Although 

Gaussian  cross-linked  chains  are  merely  caricatures  of  real  biopolymers,  they  may 

adequately  capture  the  effects  of  topology  on  the  unfolding  mechanism.  Indeed,  there 

are  good  reasons  to  believe  they  do.  Specifically, the  key finding  of our  previous study 

is  that  the  optimal  configurations  that  maximize  the  peak  force  and  the  dissipated 

energy  must  involve  parallel  strands.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  experimental 

studies 7,9,10,19-24  and  molecular  dynamics  simulations 25-29  of  the  protein  domains 

exhibiting  high  unfolding  forces,  such  as  the  I27  domain  in  titin.  F urther,  this finding 

has  le d  to  the   prediction  that  protein  domains  with  the  ubiquitin  fold,  which  features 

terminal parallel strands simila r to those in I27, exhibit superior mechanical properties, 

despite the fact that  they  have  no  apparent  mechanical  functions  in  living  organisms30. 

This  prediction 

is  supported  by  both  experiments12  and  molecular  dynamics 

simulations30,31.   

While  providing  results  that  are  qualitatively  consistent  with  atomistic  scale 

studies, our  model13 entirely ignored stochastic and rate-dependent aspects of unfolding. 

 

5 

This  is  an  unrealistic  assumption  in  many  cases  because,  in  general,  rupture  of  a 

chemical bond is a chemical reaction, i.e., a stochastic process whose rate is affected by 

the  transmitted  force32. Further, as  we  mentioned  earlier,  load-bearing proteins  exhibit  

high toughness  and strength  precisely  because  they  are  loaded  at  high  rates  so  that 

unfolding  is  a  non-equilibrium  irreversible  process  accompanied  by  large  energy 

dissipation.               

Models  of  force-induced  rupture  of  chemical  bonds  are  well  known  in  the 

contexts  of  protein  unfolding  and  ligand  unbinding19,20,32-35  and  fracture36.  In  those 

models, rupture  of a bond  is described by first order kinetics and its rate depends on the 

force transmitted by the bond. The main  purpose of this paper is to  adapt our model of 

cross-linked  Gaussian  chains  to  study  how  the  optimal  chain  configurations  that 

maximize the  excess  work and/or the  maximum   force  depend  on  the  loading  rate.  To 

this  end,  we  have  assume d  that  rupture  of  each  cross-link  is  described  by  first  order 

kinetics with a force-dependent probability and performed kinetic Monte Carlo studies 

of  the  chain  unfolding.  The  main  finding  of  this  study  is  that  the  parallel-strand 

arrangements remain optimal even when the stochastic nature of bond breaking  is taken 

into  account;  While  always  featuring  such  parallel  strands,  the  found  optimal 

configurations generally depend on the loading rate.        

The  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows. In  Section  2,  we  describe  the 

model. In Section  3, we outline   the  simulation  methods .    In Section  4, we  present our 

simulation  results.  In  Section  5,  we  discuss  implications  of  our  results  for  pulling

We suppose that loading is slow compared to a typical time  scale of thermal Brownian 

motion  of  the  chain.  In  this  case,  we  assume  that  the  value  of  the  pulling  force  F(t) 

recorded at any instant  t is the force  averaged over the thermal motion. At the same time, 

the time scale of cross-link rupture may be comparable with that of loading and so the 

rupture of a cross-link may result in a measurable change in F(t).     

We consider two rupture models for the cross-links. In the first model, to which 

we  refer  as  Model  I,  a  cross-link  ruptures  deterministically  once  its  internal  force  

reaches a critical value  fc.  This  model  has  been  studied  previously13  but  we  include  it 

here for comparisons. In the second model, to which we refer as  Model II, rupture of a 

cross-link  is  a  stochastic   process  described  by  first-order  kinetics.  Specifically,  the 

probability that the cross-link  ruptures in the  time  interval from  t to t+D

t depends only 

on the instantaneous value of the internal force f(t) and is given by32

where

  is  a  reference  force. 

Equation (4) is a commonly used model, which assumes that the free energy barrier to 

rupture decreases linearly with the force  f20,32. Although this equation is not necessarily 

quantitative31,37,  it  is  sufficient  for  qualitative  predictions,  as  it  properly  identifies  the 

rapid increase in the probability of rupture once the  internal force exceeds

Because the rate of Eq. 4 is not zero at zero force, then, strictly speaking, any 

cross-link configuration in Model II is unstable and the chain will unfold irreversibly on 

a time scale of order

1

0k - even if no force is applied. This is not realistic since the folded 

state of a protein at zero force is expected to be thermodynamically more stable than its  

unfolded state.  It is necessary to allow for the recombination of cross-links in order to 

restore  the  detailed  balance  in  the  system35,38,39. Here, we assume that the time 

0k -

1

  is 

much  longer  than  the  time  scale  of  loading.  Under  this  assumption  recombination  of 

cross-links  during  unfolding  is  unlikely  because  forces  in  each  crosslink  will  quickly 

reach  values  large  enough  to  destabilize  each  bond  thermodynamically  such  that  the  

ruptured bond state has lower free energy than that with the bond intact;  In other words, 

once the bond is broken it will be unlikely to reform unless the loading force is removed.  

For these  reasons  we  did  not  include  cross -link recombination  in  our  model; It would 

therefore  not  be  applicable  to  very  slow,  nearly  equilibrium  pulling  experiments.    In 

this respect, the physical regime explored by the present work is quite different from the 

reversible  stretching  conditions  assumed  in  the  theoretical  studies  of  RNA  and  DNA 

mechanical  denaturation40-44  and  in  the  theories  of  the  reversible  stretching  of  protein-

like  heteropolymers45-47.  Note,  however,  that  nonequilibrium  effects  have  been 

considered in ref.46       

When  the  ends  of  a  Gaussian  chain  are  pulled  apart,  its  response  follows 

Hooke’s  law48,49,  which  also  holds  in  the  presence  of  cross-links 50.  However  the 

stiffness  of  the  chain  changes  upon  cross-link rupture.  Under constant  velocity  loading 

 

9 

conditions, the force-displacement curve 

( )

 is a peace-wise linear function with 

FF e=

jumps and different slopes  (see Fig. 1). Once all the cross-links are ruptured, the slope  is 

reduced to the stiffness of the unconstrained chain,

G =
0

g

0 / L

.       

The  mechanical  response  of  a  cross -linked  chain  is  represented  by  two 

quantities  (cf.  Fig.  1) :  (i) the  maximum force  Fm  and  (ii)  “toughness”, i.e.,  the  excess 

work done  upon unfolding :

(5) 

where  u  is  the  distance  between  the  1st and  the L+1st  beads  at  the  end  of  the  pulling 

experiment, once all the cross-links have been ruptured.  

 

For Model I,  rupture is a deterministic process, so that Fm and  D W are unique 

for a given set CN. Further, the  force -displacement curve  and its parameters  Fm and D W 

can be determined upon solving a set of  N  linear  problems  that  reflect  the  sequence  of 

the rupture events. In contrast, in Model II, rupture is a stochastic process. Accordingly,  

for  a  given  set  CN,  it  is  necessary  to  determine  the  averages  of  Fm  and  D W  over 

sufficiently  large  number  of  realizations  of  the  stochastic  unfolding  process ; we  denote 

those quantities by 

mF and WD

, respectively.   

 

The adopted model will be used in the following settings: 

•  Characterization  problem:  Given  L,  CN,  g0,  k 0,  f c,  and  v  determine  

mF and WD

. 

•  Optimization  problem :  Given  L,  N,  g0,  k 0,  f c,  and  v  determine  the

3. Methods 

3.1. Elasticity analysis  

Between two rupture events, the cross-linked chain responds as a collection of Hookean 

springs 50. The springs are identified as follows: 

1.  Arrange the 2N beads belonging to the cross-links in the ascending order:

Once the springs and their stiffness have been identified, the entire assembly can be 

analyzed using the finite element method50. The results can be expressed as

3.2. Kinetic Monte Carlo method 

To simulate the  stochastic unfolding process we use the kinetic Monte Carlo 

method35,51 -53.  Suppose that at time t0, there are n cross-links. Let us evaluate the 

probability that the first rupture among those cross-links occurs at a later time, in the 

time interval between t and t+D

t. This probability is equal to the probability  S(t,t0) that 

no cross-link has ruptured  in the time interval between t0 and  t, times the sum of the 

probabilities for each of the cross-link to rupture in the time interval between t and t+D

where  x   is  a  uniformly  distributed  random  variable   in  the  interval  [0,1].  We  use 

modified  Newton’s  method  to  solve  this  equation  numerically.  Once  the  time  t  is 

generated,  we  need  to  determine  which  of  the  n  cross -links ruptures.  This  is  done  by 

computing the weighted probability  of rupture for each of the cross-links:

Next, we divide the interval [0,1] into n sub-intervals  whose lengths  are wm. Finally, we 

generate l,

 a realization of a random variable uniformly distributed in the interval [0,1], 

and identify the sub-interval containing l

. The  index  of  this  sub-interval is equal to the 

index  of  the  cross-link  to  be  ruptured. This process is followed starting with  t= 0, n=N 

and until all the cross-links are ruptured.   

The quantities 

mF and WD

 for a  given  set  CN  are  computed  by  averaging 

over NMC    realizations of the unfolding history; we used NMC = 5,000.     

3.3 Optimization     

We  used  two  optimization  methods  for  finding  the  configurations  that  maximize 

mF

and/or WD

.  In  cases  where  the  search  space  was  sufficiently  small,  we 

exhaustively  searched  over  all  possible  sets

NC . When  an  exhaustive  search  was  too 

time -consuming, we resorted to the following “random hill-climbing” procedure13:

The  meaning  of  Eq.  19a is simple: This is the force (Eq. 18)  corresponding to the most 

probable  rupture  time  that  maximizes  the  probability  density  of  Eq.  17.  As expected, 

this asymptotic expression for 

mF   reveals the logarithmic dependence on the loading 

rate 32-34.  Further, 

mF   increases  indefinitely  as

l ﬁ%

,  i.e.  the  largest  forces  are 

generated  by  chains  with  terminal  cross-links.    The  case  of 

  corresponds  to  a

chain whose ends cannot be pulled apart, and therefore  it is meaningless in the context

The excess work also grows logarithmically with  v% ,  but  in contrast to  Fm , 

its  optimization  leads  to  values  of  l%   that  depend  on  v% .  In  particular,  for  v ﬁ
%

  the 

optimal  value  is 

l ﬁ%

1/2

.  In  general,  for  moderately  large  values  of  v%   the  optimal 

value  of  l% is  in  the  range  1/2

1l< <%

  (see  Table  1).  All  of  these  conclusions  are 

straightforward  to  derive  from  the  asymptotic  approximations  of  Eq.  19  and  are 

confirmed by computing the exact expressions.   

 

It  is  instructive  that  the  optimal  chain  configuration  maximizing  the  excess 

work  WD

 in Model II in the limit of infinitely fast loading is the same as the optimal 

configuration predicted by Model I. The fast pulling limit of Model II, where a crosslink 

rupture is unlikely  until the internal force attains a sufficiently large value,

f

f

c

, can 

be  roughly  approximated  by  Model  I.  The  two  models  however   do  not  become 

equivalent  in  this limit: The unfolding force for a single crosslink is independent of the  

chain configuration and equal to a constant value of 

cf  in Model I while  it  depends  on 

both on the loading rate and the crosslink location in Model II.     

4.2 Small number of cross-links  

Model I. This case has been studied in detail in ref.  13  The  key result is that the  same 

optimal  configurations  maximize  both  Fm  and  D W.  Those  configurations  involve 

“parallel strands ”  of the form C N={{i1, j1}, {i2, j2}, …{iN, jN}} such that    i1 < i2 < … iN < 

j1 < j2 < … < jN. For example, for  N=3 and  L=50  the  optimal  configurations  have the

where  l=26  (see  Fig.  2) .  Note  that  the 

optimal  value  of  l  is 

l L»

/ 2

,  which  is  similar  to  that  found  in  the  case  of  a  single 

crosslink. 

 

Further, we showed that  optimality can be understood in terms of a continuous 

“super  cross-link”  (SCL)  model.  In  the  limit  as  the  chain  becomes  continuous,  that 

is L ﬁ

 and 

b ﬁ

0

, the topological constraint that any bead can be connected  to  only 

one cross-link can  be  relaxed because, as far as the mechanical response is concerned, 

neighboring beads become indistinguishable. Therefore one can create a SCL by placing 

all N cross-links between the same points, {i, i+l}.    Then the cross-links share the load 

equally so that the force  in each cross-link is  F/N, and the SCL acts  like a single cross-

link  that  can  sustain  a  maximum  force  of   Fm =  Nfc  resulting  in  an  excess  work  of 

unfolding equal to (cf. Eq. 16):

As in the case of N=1, the maximum D W is achieved when

1/2.

 

For a discrete chain, we cannot achieve the SCL configurations be cause of the 

imposed  constraint  prohibiting  multiple  cross-links  between  the  same  monomers. 

Nevertheless,  it  turns  out  that  the  constrained  optimal  solutions  are  very close to the 

SCL’s, and  they  involve  parallel  strands.  We  refer  to  such configurations  as  “nearly 

super cross -links”  or  NSCL’s (Fig. 2). The force in each of the cross-links in the NSCL 

configuration is approximately the same. Further, within Model I, rupture of one cross-

link  in  an  NSCL  configuration  results  in  an  increase  of  the  force  in  each  of  the

that  the  force  vs.  displacement curve  F(e)  has only a single  maximum, similarly to the 

case of a single cross-link.       

Model  II.  Remarkably,  we  found  that  the  NSCL  configurations  appear  to  be  optimal 

with respect to both mF   and  WD

, although the configurations optimal for 

mF  are 

not  necessarily  optimal  for  WD

, and vice versa. This statement is difficult to verify 

conclusively,  because  even  for  N=3  the  search  space  is  too  large  for  an  exhaustive 

search. Nevertheless,  using the search  algorithm described in Section 3.3, we could not 

find 

a 

configuration

than 

the

,  where  the  optimal  value  of  l was determined 

by  the  exhaustive  search  with  respect  to  l.  The  opt imal  values  of  l maximizing 

mF  

and  WD

  were different, which is similar to the conclusion reached with Model II for 

N=1. Furthermore,  the  values  of 

ll L=%

  that  optimize 

mF   are  close  to 

l =%

1

 and 

the  optimal  values  of  l%   that  maximize  WD

  depend  on  v%   in  a  way  similar  to  the 

case of  N=1  (See  Table  2).  We also found that 

mF   and  WD

  grow  logarithmically 

with v%  (Fig. 3). 

 

An  attempt  to  predict  the  response  of  NSCL  configurations  using  the  rate-

dependent  SCL  model  was  only  partially  successful.  In  particular,  the  rate-dependent 

SCL model was able to follow the trends predicted by the simulations but the agreement 

 

19 

was  mostly  qualitative.  Furthermore,  the  predictions  of  the  rate-dependent SCL model 

were qualitatively similar to those obtained from the analysis for  N=1. Let us mention 

that the rate-dependent SCL model was successful in predicting the first but not the last 

ruptur e  events,  especially  for  intermediate   loading  rates.  In  the  limit

one can

use the asymptotic approximations developed for N=1, with the provision that 

0k and cf  

are replaced with 

0Nk and

cNf , respectively. 

4.3 Large number of cross-links  

For N L= ,  Fm  and  D W  are  proportional  to  N  and  N2,  respectively.  Preliminary 
computations 13 have suggested that these scaling rules do not hold for large N, as both 

Fm and D W tend to saturate with increasing  N.   

Here we study in more detail the case where  each bead is connected to another 

bead so that the total number of cross-links is N =L/2 (for an even L) or (L+1)/2 (for an 

odd L). In this case, the  search space  is large and for this reason we limited our analysis 

to short chain s, L  =  19, and to  using Model I only. The key result of our computations 

can be stated as follows:   

•  All optimal configurations contained the subset of three cross-links

which, again, is a “clamp” of parallel strands. The excess work for the configuration

is

These results are further illustrated in Figure 4, where we plot the his tograms for Fm and 

D W corresponding to randomly generated cross-link configurations and configurations 

containing the subset 

3C . The latter, on the average, have larger values of both  Fm and 

*

D W, as compared to random crosslink arrangements. However, adding random cross-

links to 

3C  does not necessarily improve the mechanical resistance of the chain: only a 

*

relatively small fraction of such configurations perform better than *

3C .   

5. Discussion: Implications for force-induced  protein  unfolding.       

We  have  previously  demonstrated13  that  a  cla mp  formed  by  parallel  strands  represents  

the  optimal  topology  maximizing  both  the  unfolding  excess  work  and  the  unfolding 

maximum  force  for  the  deterministic  Model  I,  in  which  cross-links  rupture  once  the 

transmitted  force  achieve s  a  critical  value.  Molecular  mechanics  studies  have  also

the  range  of  unfolding  forces 

typical 

in  force  probe  spectroscopy  pulling 

experiments7,8,19,21,24,54-60  the  rupture  of  hydrogen  bonds  is  a  probabilistic  phenomenon 

described  by  rate  kinetics32-35.  The  present  study  demonstrates  that  parallel  strands 

remain optimal even when such kinetic effects are important. Moreover, there is  a  close 

relationship  between  the  fast  pulling  limit  of  the  proposed  kinetic  model  and  the 

deterministic Model I,  both  predicting the same conformations optima l with respect to 

 

Three   findings  of  the  present  study  may  provide  additional  insight  into  the

properties of  strong proteins: 

•  For moderate pulling rates, parallel strands formed between the  ends of 

the chain  (i.e., those with  l

L;

) lead to higher values for both  Fm and 

D W.  In  contrast,  for  very  high  pulling  rates,  parallel  strands  with 

/ 2

  are  optimal  with  respect  to  D W.  The  former  observation  is 

l L;
consistent  with  both  the  experimental9-12  and  computational25,26,30,31,37 

evidence for  (so far)  known  protein  domains with  superior  mechanical 

properties – all of them contain terminal parallel b

strands.                 

•  The  configurations  that  include  the  optimal  NSCL  configurations  are 

superior   to  random  structures (see Section  4.3).  This  result  may  shed 

light on the recent finding that proteins with different folds may display 

similar  mechanical  resistance.  In  particular,  the  unfolding  mechanisms 

 

22 

-
of the all-b

 I27 domain of the muscle protein titin19,20,25,26 and of the a

/b

 

ubiquitin  domain12,30  are  very  similar  and  are  characterized  by  a  high 

unfolding  force  because  both  of  these  domains  feature  the  same 

hydrogen-bond clamp formed by their terminal parallel strands . 

•  Adding  random  crosslinks  to  an optimal  NSCL  configuration  can  be 

viewed  to  some  extent  as  a  way  to  mimic  the  effect  of  nonnative 

interactions  in  our  Go-like  model.  As  seen  in  Fig.  4,  these  interactions 

can  both  reduce  and  enhance  the  resistance  of  the  chain  to  the 

mechanical  unfolding.  This  suggests  that  given  the  native  topology, 

further  optimization  with  respect  to  the  protein’s  mechanical stability 

can be achieved via mutations that alter non-native interactions .

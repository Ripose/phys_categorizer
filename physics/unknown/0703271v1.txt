A Hypothesis regarding the Refraction of Light and the 
precise planning of an Experiment for its Verification. 

March-29-2007

Abstract: 
It is generally known, that light propagates in transparent matter, for instance in glass or crystals, 
with  a  different  speed  than  in  vacuum.  The  interaction  responsible  therefore  can  only  be  the 
electromagnetic interaction. 
In  order  to  investigate  the  correlation  between  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  of  solid  state 
bodies and the speed of propagation of the waves within such bodies, an estimation of the typical 
field  strength  in  the  inside  of  solid  state  bodies  is  developed  and  brought  into  a  hypothetical 
connection with the speed of light within the range of the fields. This hypothesis is developed in 
the present paper. 
But a hypothesis is only valuable, if it can be verified experimentally. In order to perform such a 
verification, the planning of an experiment is described: If the hypothesis would prove right, it 
should be possible to generate electric and magnetic fields independently from solid state bodies 
(for  instance  outside  of  them)  and  measure  a  speed  of  propagation  of  electromagnetic  waves 
within these fields, different from the speed of light in vacuum. Therefore interferometers can be 
suitable.  In  the  present  paper,  the  design  of  an  experiment  with  a  Michelson-interferometer  is 
shown, containing an estimation of the necessary field-strength as well as the expectation of the 
results of the measurement of the maxima and minima of interference as a function of the field 
strength.

1. Basic principle and explanation of the hypothesis 

Matter can have some influence onto the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Also refraction 
of visible light, when entering transparent matter (as for instance glass) is an example therefore. 
A widespread explanation for refraction is based on the speed of propagation of the light-waves, 
which  is  slower  in  the  inside  of  matter  compared  to  the  speed  of  light  in  vacuum  and  which 
depends on the body in which the light is propagating. 
The basic principles which are responsible for the speed of light in the inside of matter can not 
be completely clarified here (see chapter 3.3), but the following question might help to develop 
some first idea: In which way does the solid state body influence electromagnetic waves ? For 
our approach we want to focus our interest to waves in the visible range of wavelength. 

2 of 17

 

For sure, diffraction and interference do not explain such influence, because the wavelength of 
visible  light  is  too  long  compared  with  the  distance  of  the  atoms.  Diffraction  of  x-rays  for  the 
analysis of the structure of crystals is generally known, but their wavelengths are invisible. And 
the  behaviour  of  x-rays  when  being  scattered  at  atoms  is  different  from  the  behaviour  of  light 
being diffracted. 
 
Which possibilities for the interaction between the solid state and the light do remain possible ? 
Finally  it  has  to  go  back  to  one  or  several  of  the  four  fundamental  interactions  as  there  are: 
gravitation, electromagnetic interaction, strong and weak interaction. Three of these four can be 
excluded immediately: 
▪ Gravitation is not strong enough to be noticed in the range of atomic spatial dimensions, and 
thus can be neglected regarding the interaction between photons, atomic nuclei and electrons. 
▪ ▪ In strong and weak interaction photons do not participate. 
Consequently the only possible interaction responsible for the influence of a solid state body on 
visible  light  is  the  electromagnetic  interaction.  This  means  that  electric  and  magnetic  fields 
determine the speed of photons in the inside of matter. 
 
Such electromagnetic fields are present in the inside of solid state bodies in tremendous extent. 
Their  order  of  magnitude  is  estimated  in  chapter  two.  Comparable  huge  field  strengths  are 
normally  not  observed  in  the  vacuum  over  macroscopical  distances.  One  might  think  about 
discussing  quantumelectrodynamical  phenomena  such  as  vacuumpolarisation,  but  they  are  far 
away from producing permanent fields as observed in solid state bodies. Also not necessary for 
the planning of our experiment is the attention to the electric and the magnetic field of the earth. 
They are too weak to have any measurable influence to the results of the experiment. 
 
The concrete planning of an experiment for the verification of a correlation between the electric 
and magnetic field and the speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves is the subject of the 
third chapter of the present paper. This can be understood as following: 
The  result  of  chapter  two,  which  gives  an  estimation  of  the  typical  order  of  magnitude  of  the 
electrostatic and the magnetic field strengths in solid state bodies, is taken as one of the inputs 
for the planning of the experiment. Another input is the speed of light in the material, which can 
be understood in connection with the refractive index.  
So we have to find a connection between the refractive index (or the speed of light) and the 
electrostatic and the magnetic field strength in which the light propagates. 
 
By the way: Glasses with amorphous atomic structure can be transparent as well as crystals with 
perfect regular arrangement of the atoms. Because of this, the essential reason for the formation 
of the refractive index should not be mainly searched on the basis of the atomic order but rather 
in  fields  in  the  inside  of  the  material.  This  does  not  mean  that  a  possible  atomic  order  has  no 
influence onto the refractive index. Any atomic order has an influence on the spatial distribution 
of the atoms as sources of the field and by that on the refractive index, but this could be subject a 
future refinement of the calculation. 
 
Let  us  come  back  to  our  connection between the speed of light  and the field strength. We can 
begin to search this connection as following: 
Based  on  the  field  strength  of  each  single  atom,  we  estimate  the  average  field  strength  in  the 
whole solid state body as it should be responsible for the typical refractive index as it might be 
not unusual in optics. This will be the beginning of chapter three. From the huge field strength 
and the corresponding refractive index in solid state bodies we extrapolate to the refractive index 
corresponding to such field strength values which can be practically realized in the laboratory. 
Also  a  central  hypothesis  of  this  paper  is  the  statement  that  electromagnetic  fields  operate  for 
short distances (i.e. in the inside of a body) as well as for macroscopic large distances, macros-
copically far away from matter (as produced by coils and capacitors). The distance only plays a 

3 of 17

 

role regarding the magnitude of the effect (as the reduction of the speed of light), following the 
normal distance-laws of electrodynamics, but the distance does not play a role for the existence 
of the effects at all. If we assume this rather plausible hypothesis, we can extrapolate from the 
high  field  strength  in  the  inside  of  solid  state  bodies  to  the  low  field  strength  in  a  laboratory 
experiment. But it is clear, that such a hypothesis will need experimental verification.  
 
A possible design fur such a verification experiment is already developed in the end of chapter 
three: 
Because  the  electrostatic  and  the  magnetic  field  strength  in  a  laboratory  experiment  are  much 
smaller than in the inside of matter, the speed of light and the refractive index to be measured are 
much more close to their values in vacuum than to their values in solid state bodies. The experi-
ment  will  have  to  measure  refractive  indices  not  far  away  from  one.  Therefore  interferometers 
are suitable. The design of a possible interferometer-experiment is subject of the second part of 
chapter 3.  
 
2. Estimation of the order of magnitude of electromagnetic fields in solid state bodies  

The estimation, which is objective of this chapter, shall be done in general as an average value 
typical for solid state bodies (not for a special material) and thus can only be a rough estimation 
as following: 
The electric and the magnetic field produced by every atom originates from electrons and from 
the nucleus. Because of this we have to take five sources of fields as part of the total field of an 
atom into account, according to which chapter 2 is structured: 
 
2.1. The electrostatic field of the electrons (Coulomb field) 

Because Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle allows the localization of the electrons only 
“to be within the atomic orbital”, we have to calculate the electrostatic field of the whole 
electron shell and regard this as the electrostatic field of the electrons.  
2.2. The magnetic field of the electrons because of their orbital angular momentum 
2.3. The magnetic field of the electrons because of their spin 
2.4. The electric field of the nucleus 
2.5. The magnetic field of the nucleus 

Because all atomic nuclei are rigidly fixed in the solid state body, there is no magnetic 
field  resulting  from  any  movement  of  the  nuclei.  The  only  magnetic  field  of  the  nuclei 
results from their spin. 
 

At first we will begin to estimate those five fields quantitatively for single atoms. For an exact 
calculation of the average field within a solid state body, it would be necessary to take also the 
number and the spatial distribution of all electrons belonging to each atom into account (as the 
case may be for different atoms in the body) and the charge and size of the atomic nuclei as well. 
For our first estimation we restrict our consideration (at least parts of it) to one single species of 
atoms, namely to the most simple atoms at all, the hydrogen. Even for this atom we will apply 
some approximations in order to reduce the complexity of our calculations and by that to make 
the calculations and the estimations transparent and easy comprehensible.  
 
After the estimation of the five above enumerated fields, we will estimate the total electrostatic 
and the total magnetic field of a solid state body. This will be the subject of chapter 2.6. These 
average  values  are  determined  as  spatial  average  of  the  five  fields  of  the  atoms.  For  an  exact 
calculation it would be necessary to take the crystal structure of the solid state body into account, 
from which it is possible to know the positions of all field-sources. For our rough estimation it 
seems  sufficient  to  work  with  an  average  volume  per  atom.  We  will  see,  that  the  error  of  this 
approximation is rather small compared to the error arising from the above mentioned approxi-
mations of the fields of each atom. 
 
Let us now start with the estimation of the fields.

2.1.  The electrostatic field of the electrons (Coulomb field) 
What we search is not the field of a single electron but the field of the whole electron shell. Thus 
the  field  has  to  be  calculated  from  the  charge  distribution  of  the  electron  shell,  which  we 
2ψ . For the sake of simplicity, we restrict 
calculate from the probability density of the electron 
our  calculation  to  the  hydrogen  atom  with  only  one  1s-electron,  from  which  we  can  take  the 
quantummechanical eigenfunction from a textbook of atomic physics (for instance [MAY 80]).

centre of the atom 
(=  position  of  the 
nucleus). 

 
But the crucial quantity is not the charge distribution but the electric field of the electron shell. 
This has now to be calculated from the charge density. Let us calculate the field strength in the 
distance  R   from  the  geometrical  centre  of  the  charge  distribution.  The  easiest  way  to  do  this 
calculation is to regard two parts of the electron shell separately, namely “I” and “II” in figure 1. 
Part “I” contains all the charge which is located in the inside of a sphere with the radius  R  and 
with its centre in the nucleus. All other part of the charge, which is marked with „II“, contains all 
the charge outside of the sphere with the radius  R . 
For the calculation of the electrostatic field, we can take into account the fields generated by “I” 
and by “II” separately. We begin with part “II”, because this is the most simple one. According 
to  the  Gauss  law,  charge  located  on  a  spherical  shell  does  not  produce  any  field  inside  the 
sphere. This has the consequence, that part “II” leads to a field strength of ZERO at the point  R  
(see for instance [JAC 81]). 
For the explicit calculation of the field, it is enough to take the field produced by the charge of 
part  “I”  into  account.  The  calculation  is  performed  as  a  space  integral  over  a  sphere  with  the 
radius  R . Because of the spherical symmetry of the charge distribution, we position the point of 
origin of spherical coordinates in the centre of the charge distribution and orientate the system of 
coordinates in a way that the point in which the field shall be determined has its position on the 
x-axis (see figure 2).

Because  of  the  spherical  symmetry  of  the  task,  the  field  strength  depends  only  on  the  spatial 
coordinate  R  but not on ϑ and  ϕ. Furthermore the tangential components of the field strength 
are zero, so that its radial component is identical with its absolute value except for an algebraic 
sign. Numerical integration delivers the absolute value of the field strength plotted in figure 3.

the average value of the field strength is negligible, so that we can use the simplified expression 
of  (2.4)  for  the  electrostatic  field  strength  of  the  electron  shell  of  the  hydrogen  atom  for  the

By principle it would be possible to calculate the magnetic field of this circular current according

along an axis perpendicular to the circular surface of the current (see fig.4).

Our approximation now consists of the fact, that we will assign this field strength to every point 
in  the  space  with  the  distance  r   to  the  centre  of  the  circular  current.  This  means  that  our 
approximation  adopts  spherical  coordinates  to  our  problem  which  actually  has  had  cylindrical 
symmetry. Such an approximation produces a rather huge uncertainty, but in chapter 3 we will 
see, that the field strength of the magnetic field is of inferior importance for the planning of our 
experiment, and so we will see that we can accept this approximation.

In  directions  other  than  perpendicular  to  the  circular  surface  (see  fig.4)  the  field  strength  is 
different  from  the  values  of  (2.8)  and  figure  5.  Also  for  electrons  with  quantum  numbers  and 
angular momenta different from the hydrogen ground state, the field strengths are different. Both 
of these facts indicate that our estimation of the magnetic field strength in solid state bodies is 
rather  rough.  Thus  we  shall  keep  in  mind,  that  it  might  be  necessary  for  our  experiment,  to 
produce  rather  stronger  field  than  estimated  up  to  now.  As  soon  as  we  will  see  in  chapter  3, 
which magnetic field is expected to be really necessary, we will understand, that this request is 
absolutely not critical (for the experiment in planning).

If we would try to continue our calculation in analogy to chapter 2.2 and calculate the magnetic 
field caused by the spin of the electron in the same way as it was done for the angular momen-
.  But  this  is  not  possible  because  of  a 
tum,  we  would  now  have  to  use  the  equation 
 of the electric 
principal problem, which lies in the specification of the circular surface 
current. The reason is that there is no sensible value which could be used for  oa . The problem 
appears when we want to put  oa  into (2.7) and it is not eliminated in the final result of (2.8) as 
we see. 
 
The problem that the value of  oa  corresponding with the spin is unknown by principle is known 
as following: On the one hand there is the so called classical radius of the electron with a value 
of 
 [COD 00]. On the other hand the electron is regarded as punctiform in 
Quantumelectrodynamics,  this  means,  that  it  does  not  have  any  diameter  and  not  any  inner 
structure  as  shown  by  scattering  experiments  with  an  upper  limit  of  a  possible  diameter  of  at 
 [LOH 05]. Although the second value does not

give  a  diameter  but  only  an  upper  limit  for  a  possible  diameter,  we  nevertheless  see  the 
contrariness of both statements regarding the diameter. Obviously there is not a reliable value for 
oa  which could be put into (2.9). 
Nevertheless we need an estimation for the magnetic field caused by the spin of the electron. In 
order to get this, we want to construct an analogy following (2.6) and (2.8), based on (2.9):

There we find  oa  only in the denominator. 
We know that  oa
r(cid:19) , because  oa  follows the extremely small dimensions of the electron, but  r  
rises  up  to  typical  distances  between  atoms  in  solid  state  bodies.  But  nevertheless  we  can  not 
neglect  oa , because the approximation 
r →  with 
H → ∞  which in reality is impossible by principle. It would lead into problems with convergence 
when  later  determining  the  average  value  of  the  field  strength;  and  this  is  a  problem  we  don’t 
need to treat because the pole is physically senseless. So it is clear that we will not neglect  oa . In 
fact we execute the following consideration: 
In reality Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle prohibits an exact localization of the charge on the 
electron,  so  that  there  is  no  sense  in  thinking  about  an  electric  current  loop  with  a  defined 
physical dimension which might be used to describe the electron. 
By comparing (2.10) with (2.8) we recognize that the magnetic field strength caused by the spin 
of the electron is almost in the same order of magnitude as the magnetic field strength caused by 
the orbital momentum for the volume over which the calculation of the average will have to be 
performed  (if  we  regard  the  absolute  value  of  the  field  strength).  The  only  difference  between 
(2.8) and (2.10) is that the factor  1
So  we  regard  both  field  strengths  as  comparable  strong.  This  means,  that  in  our  rough 
approximation the sum of both field strengths is about twice as large as each single summand (if 
we sum up the absolute values for the estimation of an upper limit). So our approximation for the 
total magnetic field caused by the electron is about twice the value of (2.8) and so comes to:

By  the  way  the  pole  of  the  magnetic  field  caused  by  the  spin  will  be  remarkable  only  for 
distances below 
, which is about four orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of 
visible  light.  We  assume  that  such  small  spatial  structures  will  not  be  noticed  by  the  waves  of 
visible light. This consideration additionally endorses the negligence of the possible existence of 
the mentioned above pole. 
 
We now turn our attention away from the fields caused by the electrons towards the fields caused 
by the nuclei. 
 
2.4.  The electric field of the nucleus  
For the calculation of the fields of the nucleus, the restriction to the hydrogen atom as chosen for 
the electrons (see chapters 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3) is not necessary any further. 
Nuclei are treated with spherical shape rather often, with the radii of the spheres being

(see for instance [MAY 79] with reference to [POL 35]). 
In  order  to  get  estimations  for  the  fields  of  the  nuclei,  we  want  to  compare  our  considerations 
exemplarily for three nuclei, a very small one (hydrogen), a medium one (silicon as appearing in 
glass)  and  a  rather  large  one  (lead,  added  in  glass  to  influence  the  refractive  index).  For  these 
nuclei we come to the data of table 1. With  Z = atomic number each of these nuclei generates a 
field strength of the absolute value

2.5.  The magnetic field of the nucleus 
Magnetic moments of the nucleons and therewith magnetic moments of the atomic nucleus are 
significantly smaller than the magnetic moment of the electron, because the magnetic moment is 
inversely proportional with the inertia of the particle (for the same angular momentum). Instead

The spin of atomic nuclei, which consist of more than one nucleon, results from the coupling of 
the spins of all nucleons. In a table of magnetic moments of nuclei (see [GOE 55]), some areas in 
which  nuclear  momenta  are  possible  can  be  seen  (bordered  by  so  called  Schmidt-lines),  and  it 
can be seen furthermore that almost all total magnetic momenta

Of course we remember that this is a rather rough estimation, because it is performed in analogy 
with the rough estimation of the magnetic field strength of the electrons. 
 
In  order  to  develop  an  idea  of  quantitative  values,  we  can  now  again  regard  the  nuclei  enum-
erated in table 1 and develop table 2 on the basis of these nuclei. Thereby we remember that the 
radius of the nucleus had the symbol  KR  in table 1 but the symbol  oa  in (2.14) and table 2. The 
maximum of the field strength appears at the surface of the nucleus itself, this is at

2.6.  Estimation of  the average values of the fields  
The central question of our paper asks for the connection between the speed of propagation of 
light waves and the field strength which these waves have to pass on their way – maybe in the 
inside of a solid state body or maybe outside of any solid state body. The answer to this question 
shall be discussed on the basis of the estimations of the field strengths of the chapter 2.1 to 2.5. 
 
(a.) Diffraction can be excluded in the inside of solid state bodies for visible light: 
The speed of propagation of light waves (with wavelengths in the visible range) in the inside of 
lenses or crystals is not determined by diffraction and interferences. Thus it can be presumed that 
electromagnetic waves pass on straight lines through solid state bodies without being diffracted 
at atoms, this means without changes of their direction in the inside of the material. This is not 
 is much 
surprising, because the typical wavelength of the light of about 
too large for diffraction at atoms with typical dimensions of about few 
 
(b.) Hence only one possible reason for the speed of light in solid state bodies remains: 
This  reason  has  to  be  found  in  the  electromagnetic  interaction  as  explained  in  chapter  1.  This 
interaction  can  be  understood  quantitatively  on  the  basis  of  the  electromagnetic  fields  from 
chapter 2.1 to 2.5. 
But it also has to be taken into account that visible electromagnetic waves with their wavelengths 
extend  over  very  many  lattice  cells  and  by  that  they  are  exposed  to  all  the  field  strengths  on 
various positions within the lattice at the same time. Hence, for the interaction between the solid 
state body and the electromagnetic wave, we have to regard the spatial average value of the field 
strength,  calculated  over  many  lattice  cells.  This  calculation  is  the  subject  of  chapter  2.6  as 
following: 
 

4 .... 8 10

⋅

(cid:32) Because of the periodicity of the lattice, the spatial averaging over many lattice cells leads to 
the same result as the averaging over one lattice cell, represented by one unit cell. For the sake of 
simplicity of the calculations, a further approximation was applied, namely the negligence of the 
fields  of  the  atoms  from  neighbouring  cells  within  each  lattice  cell.  This  should  be  a  good 
approximation,  because  of  the  rapid  decrease  of  the  field  strength  with  the  distance  from  the 
source of the field. This means that our average is calculated (in approximation) simply for one 
atom and for one lattice cell. 
 

(cid:32) Furthermore our estimation of the average field strength is not carried out for a special lattice 
structure  (such  as  fcc,  bcc,  hcp,  etc.)  but  it  should  be  regarded  as  a  representative  estimation 
independent from the special structure. (Let us remember that the amorphous structure of glass is 
irregular.)  The  main  influence  of  the  lattice  structure  on  our  estimation  is  coming  from  the 
spatial  positions  of  the  atoms.  In  order  to  develop  a  first  idea  of  this  influence,  we  regard  the 
space  factors  of  various  lattice  structures  and  try  to  estimate  a  somehow  representative  space 
factor for various lattice structures: 

11 of 17

 

Packed very close are the lattices of hcp- and fcc- structure with a space factor of   74% . 
Packed rather slight is the lattice of the diamant- structure with a space factor of   34% . 
The arithmetic mean value of these both space factor is

. 

This value is rather close to the mean value of the space factors compared above. Cubes fill the 
space by  100% . Spheres placed in the centres of the cubes fill the space by  52% . In this sense 
we regard the calculation of the average field strength within a sphere as representative as far as 
referring to the space factor. This shall be sufficient for our consideration of the crystal structure 
for our first rough approximation under consideration here. 
 
(cid:32) But the lattice of crystals are not described only by the crystal structure but also by the lattice 
spacing. The lattice spacing defines the diameter of the sphere whose volume we want to bring 
into our calculation. In order to take lattice spacings into account, we will chose a representative 
value in the middle of the range of typical lattice spacings (see for instance [KIT 83]): 
- Chromium and Iron have rather small lattice spacing of a bit less than  2.9Å . 
- Stannous has a rather large lattice spacing of a bit less than  6.5Å . 
- The majority of most of the lattice spacings are in the range of  3.... 5Å . 

For  the  planning  of  our  experiment,  an  estimation  of  the  field  strength  to  the  upper  side  is  a 
secure estimation. An upper estimation of the field strength is received for a rather small lattice 
spacing,  because  close  to  the  atomic  nucleus,  the  field  strength  is  higher  than  more  far  away 
from the nucleus, so that averaging over spheres with smaller diameter lead to higher (=securer) 
Å = 4 1 Å  
values for the average field strength. Thus we regard a lattice constant of about 
±
as sensible. The diameter of the sphere (as half of the binding distance) shall then be put into our 
calculation with 

3.... 5

(cid:32) The averaging has to be done for a continuous volume, so the average field strength is calcu-
lated by integration over a volume, with the limit of integration beginning at the surface of the 
nucleus (the radius 

IR ) and ending at the radius  BR . 

Thus the volume for the integration is

This average by integration shall be calculated now, at first for the electric field (where the field

electron is negative and the nucleus positive, both fields have arithmetic signs contrarily to each

This is the field strength of the total electrostatic field of the atoms in solid state bodies in rough 
estimation as an average over one lattice cell, as it influences a light wave passing the solid state 
body.  The  uncertainty  of  this  estimation  is  rather  large,  especially  because  it  is  not  done  for  a 
special  configuration  of  atoms  of  a  special  solid  state  body.  So  we  will  use  a  value  of

As expected, the average of the magnetic field strength of the electron shell is remarkably higher 
than the average of the magnetic field strength produced by the nucleus. Because of the fact, that 
the  orientation  of  both  fields  relatively  to  each  other  is  not  predetermined,  we  get  a  secure

3. Proposal of an experiment for the verification of the hypothesis 

The  central  hypothesis  of  this  paper  is  the  statement,  that  the  speed  of  propagation  of  light  is 
influenced by electric and magnetic fields – no matter whether these fields appear in the inside of 
solid  state  bodies  or  outside  of  them.  In  the  experiment  planned  in  the  chapter  3,  the  distance 
between  the  field  source  (as  for  instance  coils  and  capacitors)  and  the  place  where  the 
electromagnetic waves are influenced are of macroscopical dimensions. 
This central hypothesis is based on the plausible assumption, that distance itself does not cancel 
the  existence  of  electric  and  magnetic  fields  at  all,  but  distance  only  has  an  influence  (by 
increasing the field strength) according to the distance laws as known from electrodynamics. 

Objective  of  our  experiment  is,  to  prove  that  there  is  a  connection  between  electrostatic  and 
magnetic fields and the speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves within these fields. 
 
3.1. Correlation between the field strength and the speed of light 
The field strength realizable in a laboratory outside of solid state bodies are significantly smaller 
than the field strengths in the inside of solid state bodies. Thus for the planning of our experi-
ment,  we  now  have  to  extrapolate  from  the  field  strength  of  chapter  2  to  the  field  strength 
practically obtainable by the use of coils and capacitors. This can be done as following: 
The typical field strength values inside solid state bodies (at least their order of magnitude) are 
taken  from  the  estimations  (2.18)  and  (2.19).  To  find  a  relation  between  these  values  and  the 
speed with which electromagnetic waves propagate in the field’s range of influence, we go back 
to the speed of light in solid state bodies. This speed is known from the definition of the index of 
, which is between 1 and 2 for many types of glasses and for many transpa-

and the speed of light in a space filled with this field strength. The index “0” is used in the first 
line in table 3 for the field strength, for the speed of light and for the refractive index in order to 
remember, that this line is the introduction into table 3.

For the development of all the other lines in table 3, please consider the following explanations: 
The exact connection between the field strength and the speed of light is not yet known, and can 
be elaborated not before the planned experiment has brought its results. Thus we decide to work 
with a linear approximation as following: 
Let us assume that the effect caused by the electric and the magnetic fields can be understood as

a linear approximation and come to proportionality 
(3.1) 
∆ ∝

where  F  represents the field strength responsible for the alteration of the speed of propagation 
of  electromagnetic  waves,  which  can  be  the  electric  field  strength  E   as  well  as  the  magnetic 
field  strength  H .  Consequently  we  indicate  the  proportionality 
∆ ∝ .  On  these

compared to field strengths in solid state bodies. 

c∆   is  rather  small  compared  to  the  speed  of  light  c   in  vacuum,  this  means

For the sake of comprehensibility, the connections between the field strength, the speed of light 
and the refractive index used in table 3 are developed as formulae now:

3.2. Concrete quantitative planning for the assembly of a Michelson-interferometer 
The measurement of the speed of light in a medium can for instance be done with an interfero-
meter.  It  should  be  applied  in  the  same  way  to  electric  and  magnetic  fields  coexisting  in  the 

15 of 17

 

empty space. Figure 6 shows the assembly of a Michelson-Interferometer which is equipped with 
a vacuum chamber which contains a device to generate electric and magnetic fields. The sense of 
the vacuum is to exclude any influence created by matter (as for instance by the molecules of the 
air) which also might react to the fields. By this means it shall be assured, that the speed of light 
is really influenced by the vacuum and the fields in the vacuum – but not by anything else.

interferometer with a vacuum chamber and

How to perform the experiment: 
At the beginning both mirrors have to be adjusted in a way that the observer sees a well defined 
situation  of  interference  (this  is  either  a  maximum  or  a  minimum  of  interference)  when  the 
vacuum chamber is evacuated and all fields (the magnetic and the electric field) are switched off. 
After this is achieved, the magnetic and the electric field have to be enhanced continuously, so

that  the  light  will  have  to  pass  the  distance  „ x “  (twice  the  distance  „ 2
With continuously increasing field strengths, the speed of light should decrease continuously.  
For the determination of the maxima and minima of interference, we have to distinguish between 
the passing duration of the light “with” and “without” fields, this means that

By  continuously  enhancing  the  field  strength  along  the  distance  „ x “  it  should  be  possible  to 
produce  continuously  maxima  and  the  minima  of  interference  following  each  other.  If  the 
adjustment of the mirrors has been done in a way that a maximum of interference occurred at the 
field  strength  of  zero  (which  can  be  enumerated  as  maximum  no.  0),  the  next  maxima  and

Having  the  comments  at  the  end  of  chapter  2.2  in  mind,  we  remember  that  the  magnetic  field 
strength really necessary for the extrema of interference can deviate from the order of magnitude 
estimated here remarkably. Especially for the magnetic field, the uncertainties of our estimation 
are rather huge. But this is not a serious problem, because the required strength of the magnetic 
field is not very high, and it would not cause a technical problem to enhance the magnetic field

In  contrary  to  the  generation  of  the  magnetic  field,  the  generation  of  the  electric  field  is  a 
technical challenge. Thus the electrical field will somehow define a limit to the feasibility of our 
experiment. Hence it should be sensible to develop an estimation how much of uncertainty in the 
approximation  in  chapter  2  can  be  tolerated  without  endangering  the  feasibility  of  the 
experiment.  Therefore  we  compare  the  requested  electrical  field  strength  with  the  dielectric 
breakdown  field  strength  of  the  vacuum,  which  limits  the  enhancement  of  the  field  strength  in 
the experiment. The breakdown field strength of the vacuum is about  500

This  means  that  there  is  hope  for  the  success  of  the  experiment  as  long  as  our  above

2   orders  of  magnitude  with

regard to the electric field strength. We are convinced that the uncertainty of estimation of the 
electrical field strength should not be that huge, so that there should still be some reserve left for 

17 of 17

 

technical  difficulties  in  the  practical  setup  of  an  experiment.  An  example  for  such  inevitable 
technical  difficulties  might  be  the  point-discharge  on  some  microscopical  roughness  on  the 
surface of the capacitor used for the generation of the electrical field.  
After  all,  there  is  the  hopeful  expectance,  that  the  planned  experiment  might  show  more  than 
only two maxima and minima of interference. The more maxima and minima can be seen, the 
better  the  resolution  of  the  measurement  will  be  –  with  regard  to  the  refractive  index  as  a 
function of the field strength of the electrostatic and the magnetic fields. 
 
3.3. Objectives of the experiment  
● A first objective is of course a “confirmation of the principle” that the above hypothesis that 
the speed of light depends on the field strength to which the waves are exposed is existing at all, 
and that this dependence is not influenced by the distance to source of the fields. 
● A second objective will be the quantitative identification of the connection between the field 
strength and the speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves therein.  
In  the  ideal  case  it  should  possible  to  develop  a  formula  which  gives  the  speed  of  light  as  a 
mathematical function of the electric and of the magnetic field strength. 
● A third long-term objective should be a deeper theoretical understanding of the mathematical 
formula  developed  under  the  second  objective.  The  basic  understanding  might  be  searched  on 
the basis of the non trivial structure of the vacuum (see for instance [GIA 03]). 
● A possible application could be the production of electrically adjustable lenses.

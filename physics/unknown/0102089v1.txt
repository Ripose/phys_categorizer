ABSTRACT 

 
In the framework of the Wave Universe concept it is shown, that the genesis of redshifts can be 
connected  with  the  intra-system  (endogenous)  processes,  which  take  place  in  astronomical 
systems. The existance of extremal redshift objects (quasars - QSO) with most probable  
 
 
is predicted.  

z = 3.513 (3.847);   4.677;   6.947 (7.4);   10.524;   14.7;   27.79; 

 
THE WAVE (MEGAWAVE) ASTRODYNAMICS CONCEPT 

 
A  wide  set  of  yet  noninterpreted  (enigmatic  from  the  point  of  view  of  standard  paradigma  of 
celestial  mechanics  and  astrophysics  [1,2])  observed  and  experimental  data,  connected  with  the 
dynamical  structure  and  geometry  of  the  Solar  system  (in  particular,  with  the  arragement  of 
planetary,  satellite  orbits,  distribution  its  velocities,  etc.)  and  other  astronomical  systems  can  be 
adequately interprated in the framework of Wave (Megawave) Astrodynamics (and Wave Universe 
concept) [2-6]. 

Accordingly to these representations, real objects observed in the Universe (in the megaworld, 
such  as  astronomical  systems,  for  example,  the  Solar  system)  appear  principally  wave  dynamic 
systems (WDS), in the some sence similar to the atom system (Micro - Mega analogy [2]), and can 
be described by Fundamental wave equations (in particular, Schrodinger-type equation) (Fig.1).

EXTREMELY LOW MASS 

 
From  the  comparison  of  the  circulation  parameters,  carried  out  in  the  end  of  70s  in  the 

monograph [2, p.245], naturally follows an evident, lying at surface, consequence.

The  physical  sence  of  appearance  of  such  an  extremally  low  mass  merits  the  special 
discussion.  Meanwhile  just  note  that  this  valuation  is  close  to  the  upper  limit  of  the  experimental 
valuation of the photon mass [7]:

SPECTRUM OF ELITE VELOCITIES 

 
The  Fundamental  wave  equation,  described  the  Solar  system  (similarly  to  the  atom  system), 
separates  the  spectrum  of  physically  distinguished,  stationary  -  elite  -  orbits,  corresponding  to 
mean quantum numbers N, including the spectrum of permissible elite velocities vN. 

The following representation holds for the physically distinguished – elite – velocities vN in the 

G[s] Shells of wave dynamical (in particular, astronomical) systems [3-6]: 

vN = vN

[s] = (2p )1/2(cid:215) C*

[s]/N,  C*

[s = C*

[1](cid:215)

-(s-1),  s = 0,  – 1, – 2, … 

[1] – Sound velocity of cosmic plasma in G[1] Shell [Chechelnitsky, [2-6], 1980-1992]), 

(c  - Fundamental parameter of Hierarchy (Chechelnitsky Number) c =3.66(6),  
C*
where elite values N (as it follows from observations) are close, in the general case, to the counting  
set  of N - Integer (semi - integer). 

The  most  stable  -  dominant  (strong  elite)  –  orbits  and  the  related  dominant  velocities 

correspond to the dominant values of quantum numbers, close to 

N = NDom = 8; 11; 13; (15.5) 16; 19.5; (21.5) 22.5. 

It can be shown, that 

also is the physically distinguished (dominant) value N [6]. 

NTR = c (2p )1/2 @  9.191 

INVARIANCE (UNIVERSALITY) OF THE ELITE VELOCITIES SPECTRUM 

 

The spectrum of physically distinguished elite velocities vN and quantum numbers N of arbitrary 
wave dynamic systems (WDS) has some universal peculiarity. It is practically identical - invariant 
(universal) for all known observed systems of the Universe. 

In  particular,  the  velocity  spectra  of  experimentally  well  investigated  Solar  and  satellite 
systems  practically  coincide  for  the  observed  planetary  and  satellite  -  dominant  -  orbits, 
corresponding to some (dominant) values of quantum numbers NDom. Thus it can be expected that 
the  spectrum  of  elite  (dominant  -  planetary)  velocities  of  the  Solar  system  (well  identificated  by 
observations) can be effectively used as quite representative - internal (endogenous) - spectrum of 
elite (dominant) velocities, for example, of far astronomical systems of the Universe. 

PHYSICALLY DISTINGUISHED REDSHIFTS 

In  the  framework  of  the  developed  representations  of  Wave  (Megawave)  Astrodynamics  and 
Wave  Universe  concept  [2-6]  the  analytical  representation  can  be  obtained  for  physically 
distinguished  -  preferably  observed  (elite)  -  redshifts  of  far  astronomical  objects  (galaxies, 
quasars). 

The physically justified by experience (and correct consequences) relation z = f(v) between the 

velocity n  and the redshift z has the form  
 
 
where c=299792.458 km(cid:215) s-1 - light velocity. 

 

 

      z=b 2 =(v/c) 2,            b =v/c, 

This correlation between the redshift z and the (orbital) velocity v (as opposed to other relations) 
is carefully examined  experimentally  in  laboratory  conditions - on the Earth (Paund and Rebka’s 
experiment) and  in  Space  -  from  the  Sun (Brault’s experiment) [8]. 

It is also interesting to note that the used square dependence in the functional (mathematical) 

plane is in fact identical to the relation used in the calculation of the so-called gravity redshift [8]  

where v2=GM/r,  v - orbital velocity. 

z=GM/c2r=(v/c) 2, 

THE PEAKS z IN OBSERVATIONS AND IN THEORY 

It may be shown that the most important peaks in histograms (of distribution) of the observed z 
unaccidentally  and  with  sufficient  reliability  coincide  with  the  physically  distinguished-dominant  - 
values zN

[s] (at N=NDom). 

For example, the peaks widely known from observations peaks (Figs. 2, 3)  from [9-10]  

coincide with the dominant (N=NDom)  zN

ENDOGENOUS NATURE OF z 

The set of large quantity of facts, agreement between of theory and observations, including the 
possibility  of  correct  description  of  distinguishing  peaks  z  over  all  the  observed  redshifts  range 
(beginning from z=0) makes the next conclusion natural. 

Assertion.  It  seems  very  probable  that  the  true  genesis  and  physical  nature  of  the  observed 
redshifts is considerably closer connected with the own (inner) wave shell structure of astronomical 

 

 

 

 

 

c
systems  (galaxies,  quasars),  than  with  the  "kinematic"  motion  (translation) of their mass center - 
with the galaxies "expansion". 

ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF OBJECTS WITH EXTREMAL z 

 
In  the  framework  of  the  Wave  Universe  representations  it  must  be  expected that replenishing 
statistics of newly discovered astronomical objects will be characterized by the distribution peaks at 
z  that  correspond  to  the  physically  distinguished  -  dominant  -  values  of  redshifts,  in  particular, 
belonging to the G[-7] Shell:

[-7] = 27.79; 14.7; 10.524; (7.4)6.947; 4.677; (3.847)3.513. 
Already  at  the  present  it  is  interesting  to  note  apparently,  unaccidental  compliance  of  the 
observed  values  z  of  (remotest  for  1986)  quasars  z=3.53  (quasar  OQ  172)  and  z=3.78  (quasar 
PKS  2000-330)  with  the  pointed  above  z[-7]  dominant  values  of  the  G[-7]  Shell  (z=3,513  and 
z=3.847). 

[-7] = z*

zN

Thus,  it  is  not  excluded,  that  the  quasars  OQ  172  and  PKS  2000  -  330  will  become  not  as 
much the last from discovered quasars of preceding population QSO (G[-6]) with active  G[-6] Shell 
as  the  first  (and  evidently  having  not  the  highest  values  of  z)  from  discovered  quasars  of  new 
population QSO (G[-7]) with active G[-7] Shell . 
 

THE PROBLEM OF SEARCH 

 
Basing  on  the  above  -  discussed  prognosis,  we  may  also  point  to  a  set  of  supplementary 
physical    orientating  circumstances,  that  essentially  shorten  the  search  field  for  the  objects  with 
extermal  z.  One  of  them  resides  in  the  fact  that  the  search  must  be  carried  out,  in  particular, 
among    the  astronomical  objects  having  abundant  radiation  (peculiarities,  peaks,  radiation 
anomalies),  besides  gamma,  in  close  infrared  range,  too.  Really,  for  example,  for  hydrogen  La   - 
line 

l (La ) = 1215.67
we have the system of shifted  (by the redshift z=z[-7]) wave lenghts

that lay in IR-range. 

Purposeful  search  of  objects  (most  probably  having  z  that  are  close  to  the  pointed  above),  in 
particular,  among  objects  as  Seyfert  galaxies,  Markarjan  galaxies,  may  lead  to  discovery  of  new 
astronomical systems, which are characterized by extremal, so far unknown values of redshifts. 

 

 

FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS 

 
Three  years  after  the  exposition of preceding results in 1986 [11-12] followed by a discussion 
between a confined circle of researchers - astrophysicists, in the end of 1989, american scientists 
from  the  Palomar  Observatory  M.  Schmidt,  J.  Gunn,  D.  Schnaider  discovered  the  extremely  far 
object  of  the  Universe  -  quasar  in  the  Ursa  Major  constellation.  It  is  interesting  to  note  also  that 
using of the experimental "solar" value N=19.43 (instead of N=19.5) indicates the more close (to 
discovered) value z=4.71 (instead of z=4 .677).

Post Scriptum (2000) [From Chechelnitsky, 2000]: 
 
What Quasars with Record Redshifts Will be Discovered in Future? 
Megaquantization in the Universe. 

It  is  clear,  Megaquantization  (quantization  “in the Large”), observed megaquantum effects are 

not monopolic privelege of only Solar system. 

Let  us  point  the  brief  resume  of  research  (prognosis),  connected  with  problem  of  redshift 

quantization of far objects of Universe – quasars (QSO) [Chechelnitsky, (1986) 1977]: 

“Abstract:  In  the  framework  of  the  Wave  Universe  concept  it  is  shown  that  the  genesis  of 
redshifts  can  be  connected  with  the  intra-system  (endogenous)  processes  which  take  place  in 
astronomical  systems.  The  existence  of  extremal  redshift  objects  (quasars  –  QSO)  with  most 
probable z=3.513 (3.847); 4.677; 6.947 (7.4); 10.524; 14.7; 27.79; … is predicted.” 
Prognosis already had justified successively for extremal values of z redshifts  

ztheory = 3.513,      zobs = 3.53 (quasar OQ172) 
ztheory = (3.847),   zobs = 3.78 (quasar PKS2000-330) 
ztheory = 4.677,      zobs = 4.71 (Schmidt, Gunn, Schnaider, 1989) 
                            zobs = 4.694 (4.672) (quasar BR1202-0725, Wampler et al., 1996) 
At the present time, apparently, also the object Q2203+29 G73 with record value z of redshift 
z=6.97 is discovered in special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO, Russia) ztheory = 6.947, zobs = 6.97 
(Q2203+29 G73, Dodonov et al., 2000). 

The Quene – for objects with even more high redshifts z = 10.524; 14.7; … 
Consequences of such successfully realizable prognosis, imperatives of observations not only 
are  unexpected  for  the  Standard  cosmology,  but  also,  probably,  its  can  stimulated  the  radical 
reconsideration of many habitual representations, having become as freezen dogmas.

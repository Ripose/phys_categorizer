1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The  so  called  anthropic  reasoning1  is  at  the  centre  of  an  intense  debate  which  in  recent  times  has 
sparked  not  only  physicists  and  cosmologists  but  also  philosophers  and  theologians.  One  of  the main 
reasons  of  this  wide  interest  surely  resides  in  the  teleological  overtones  of  many  recent  expositions 
focused  on  the  topic  of  the  fine tuning  of  some  quantities  which come  out  from  fundamental  physics 
and cosmology. 
The  surprising  coincidences  deriving  from  dimensionless  combinations  of  fundamental  constants  of 
physics and cosmological parameters urged many authors to point out at the special character of  many 
features of our universe in innumerable papers and proceedings.2 They have frequently underlined that 
the possibility itself of biological complexity depends critically upon the peculiar values of the coupling 
constants of the four fundamental forces, the slight mass difference between the neutron and the proton, 
and the actual values of those cosmological quantities that, as in case of the Hubble constant H and the 
density parameter (cid:1), govern cosmic evolution. 
To quote some well known examples, a change of more than 1% of the strong force coupling constant 
would  result  in  the  absence  of  elements  heavier than  lithium;  a  little  modification  of  the  value of  the 
fine structure constant and/or of its gravitational analogue would have result in the lack of those main 
sequence stars which are indispensable for the emergence of complexity and life; a small change in the 
neutron-to-proton mass ratio would again produce disastrous consequences both for the production of 
hydrogen  itself  and  the  existence  of  main  sequence  stars;  a  modification  of  the  actual  values  of  the 
above-mentioned  parameters  H  and  (cid:1)  (which  are  connected  through  Einstein’s  field  equations  of 
general relativity) would result in the production of universes inadequate to produce life at some stage 
of their evolution. 
Similar considerations have revealed the existence of a „delicate balance”3, stimulating three different 
approaches.  The  silent majority  of  physicists,  waiting  for  future  developments  of  their  discipline,  has 
assumed  a  typical  “who cares?”  attitude,  while a  consistent  part of  scholars  (including  many eminent 
names  of  the  physics  community)  found  themselves  faced  with  a  choice  between  the  following  two 
alternatives: 
 
-  1) the „fine tuning” implies the existence of a „fine tuner”4

1 For the meaning of this expression see: Rees, M.J.: Before the beginning. Our universe and others, London 1997. Note that 
Rees  does  not  define  explicitly  what  he  means  with  anthropic  reasoning.  He  simply  says  that  talking  of  principles  is 
„unfortunate”, and declares  then „to prefer the less pretentious phrase ‘anthropic reasoning’”. This last expression was used 
also  in  the  recent  Bostrom,  N.:  Anthropic  bias:  observation  selection  effects  in  science  and  philosophy,  London  2002,  to 
summarize a series of topic of anthropic content. 
2 The literature on the topic is immense. The classic texts to become familiar with the arguments involved are: Barrow, J.D.-
Tipler,  F.J.:  The  anthropic  cosmological  principle,  Oxford  1986;    Davies,  P.C.W.:  The  accidental  universe,  Cambridge

- 2) the surprise raised by the „fine tuning” disappears if we consider our universe as a very particular 
member  of  a  large  ensemble  of  “universes”  characterized  by  all  possible  combinations  of  initial 
conditions and fundamental constants. 
 
This  dichotomy  between  a  divine  Designer  and  a  “many  worlds”  conception  has  indeed  been  at  the 
centre of innumerable discussions and speculations. Moreover, it has also been the main motive of that 
debate on the anthropic principle which, in the last twenty years or so, has passed from the pages of the 
physical and astronomical journals to those of popular books and public conferences. 
The point is here that the emergence of teleological aspects in the abovementioned discussion came out 
as a by-product of a technical debate which originally involved a significant group of cosmologists and 
gravitational researchers and which initially evolved without any kind of teleological overtones (apart 
few notable exceptions as that due to John Archibald Wheeler5). 
On  the  contrary  the  concept  of  many  different  worlds,  at  least  as  a  counterpart  of  the  idea  that  our 
observed region could be not representative of the whole Cosmos, was part and parcel of the anthropic 
debate since the very beginning. 
This  history  notwithstanding,  many  people  believe  that  the  strict  association  between  anthropic 
reasoning  and  teleology  was  always  there.  As  a  matter  of  fact  this  belief  is  largely  due  to  the  public 
debate  that  followed  the  publication  of  Barrow  and  Tipler’s  essay  The  Anthropic  Cosmological 
Principle  in  1986.  Those  two  authors  were  surely  not  the  first  to  perceive  or  discuss  the  teleological 
implications  of  anthropic  principle(s),  but  their  book  was  surely  very  influential  in  promoting  a 
“resurgence  of  teleological  views”  if  not  within  the  context  of  contemporary  physics,  surely  in  large 
part of the studies concerning the philosophical meaning of physical researches. 
In  the  following  pages  I  will  try  to  outline  a  history  of  anthropic  reasoning  and  principles,  limiting 
myself to the ambit of cosmology, where the arguments emerged. One of my aims will be to show that 
teleological  elements  entered  the  debated  topics  only  at  a  relatively  late  ,  while  reflections  on  many 
worlds represented a complement of anthropic ideas since the very beginning.6 
 

2. COSMIC SPECULATIONS AND ANTHROPIC HINTS IN PRE-RELATIVISTIC PHYSICS 

 
To single out an origin for the application of anthropic reasoning in cosmology is probably a matter of 
taste. At any rate, an important preliminary notion for any properly cosmological talk consists in a well-
defined concept of the universe as a whole. 
A  non-contradictory  quantitative  concept  of  the  universe  as  a  self-contained  entity  was  not  available 
until the emergence of general relativistic cosmology in 1917. Before that date, the universe was indeed 
a very vague and undefined concept. As everyone knows, a Newtonian cosmology was in effect beset 
with  unsolvable  paradoxes  due  to  the appearance  of  divergent  integrals  in  all  problems  containing  an 
infinite and uniformly distributed quantity of matter in an infinite Euclidean space. 
The  term  universe  itself  was  not  used  with  great  pleasure  among  scientists  if  not  as  a  generic  name 
applied exclusively to that architecture of the heavens that emerged from observations.”7 

                                                 
5 Wheeler is a very important, but also a rather sui generis, figure in the ambit of contemporary’s physics community. For a 
surely romanced report on his personality see: Overbye, D.: Lo splendente meccanismo dell’universo, Scienza ’81,  1981, p. 
64-70  (and  also:  Overbye,  D.:  God's  Turnstile:  The  Work  of  John  Wheeler  and  Stephen  Hawking,  Mercury  20,  n.  4, 
July/August  1991,  p.  98-108.)  The  use  of  anthropic  reasoning  was  surely  not    the  first    example  of  a  close  proximity  of 
Wheeler with teleology. Just to quote an example, think at the implication of the formulation of electrodynamics developed 
by him and his pupil Richard Feynman in Wheeler, J.A.-Feynman, R.P.: Interaction with the absorber as the mechanism of 
radiation, Reviews of Modern Physics 17, 1945, p. 157-181. 
6 Of course, I am not saying that teleological interpretations of physical results or principles are something new. This will be 
simply wrong (as showed, for instance, by interminable debates on the meaning of action principles). I am simply saying that 
the teleological interpretation of the anthropic principle became commonplace mainly after Barrow and Tipler’s book. 
7 As significant anecdotes let me say that Clifford affirmed that „in regard to the universe” there was „no right to draw any 
conclusion  at  all"  (Clifford  W.K.:  The  first  and  the  last  catastrophe.  A  criticism  on  some  recent  speculations  about  the 
duration of the universe, 1874; reprinted in Lectures and essays, volume 1, London 1901, p. 222-267, quotation on p. 264), 
while -three decades later- Rutherford prohibited his students to use that expression during his lessons.

A  notable  exception  was  the  debate  on  the  global  applications  of  the  principles  of  thermodynamics. 
Undoubtedly, although not in a rigorous mathematical sense, the term universe appeared often in that 
context  in  connection  with  the  well-known  prediction  of  a  state  of  thermodynamical  equilibrium  and 
mechanical Heath Death. 
The second Hauptsatz posed, amongst other urgent conceptual questions, a major conundrum about the 
present  state  of  the  world;  i.e.:  why  the  observed  universe  appeared  so  remote  from  the  state  of 
equilibrium? 
It is difficult to establish who stated the problem first, but it soon became a major open question. With 
an eternity of time available it seemed absurd that the Heath Death wasn't reached yet, at least if you 
are  not  ready  to  accept  a  blatant  violation  of  the  first  principle  as  that  of  a  special  beginning  of  the 
universe as a whole or, at least, of the cosmical surroundings of that particular region of the universe 
which is inhabited by us. 
Just to quote a couple of examples, Vogt discussed the topic around 18788, while Fitzgerald, in 1894, 
asked9: 
 
why the ether, the solar system, and the whole universe were not subject to the Boltzmann-Maxwell law? 

Amongst the many attempts to furnish answers to  questions of this kind, we can distinguish a class of 
answers  of  anthropic  flavour.  The  first  author  to  suggest  something  of  this  kind  was  presumably 
Samuel  Tolver  Preston.  This  English  physicist  dedicated  large  part  of  his  time  to  thermodynamics, 
invoking an application of10 
 
the principles of kinetic theory to the case of the universe not so much as a speculation, but rather as a necessary 
deduction following from the known principle that detached mass moving freely in space (as the stellar masses 
are observed to do) and at such distances apart that gravity between the several masses is incompetent to deflect 
the  path  of  the  masses  appreciably,  must  move  in  straight  lines,  and  have  their  motions  regulated  under  the 
mutual encounters in accordance with the principles of the kinetic theory. 
 
In  1879  he  suggested  that  the  scale of the  universe  was  „too  big” for  human  observers11  and that our 
conclusions were then vitiated by an „extremely limited view”.12 Preston argued that the region of the 
universe  that  we  inhabit13  could  be  atypical  because  of  its  „rather  exceptional”  concentration  of  hot 
luminous stars and suggested that14: 
 
We  may  happen  to  be  in  a  part  [of  the  universe]  where  the  mean  temperature  of  the  component  matter  is 
exceptionally high, as, of course, from the fact of our being in existence, we must be in a part which is suited to 
the conditions of life. 
 
Although this passage clearly recalls many contemporary anthropic statements, it does not follow that 
Preston’s position was particularly in the vanguard. His treatment was in fact just one among many, in

11 Preston imagined human observers in a position analogous to that of a Maxwell's demon intent on reaching conclusions 
about the equilibrium temperature of a gas from the point of view of a single molecule. See: Preston, S. T.: On the possibility 
of  accounting  for  the  continuance  of  recurring  changes  in  the  universe,  consistently  with  the  tendency  to  temperature-

13  Preston pointed  out  that  such a region (as  other  similar  ones)  must  be  „amply  extensive enough to allow an amount  of 
activity  and  variability  of energy  adapted to  the conditions of life”.  He suggested  moreover  that a  region „very extensive, 
absolutely speaking”, results  „infinitesimal, relatively speaking (i.e., in comparison with the boundless universe)”. Cf.: On

the  large  debate  on  the  cosmological  application  of  the  kinetic  theory  and  on  the  consequences  of 
energy dissipation. The scenario of the universe depicted by Preston, moreover, was typical of the day 
and involved, for instance, the presence of a large number of dark stars to explain the energetic source 
of the luminous stars. At last, as for many other authors, the main target of Preston was that of showing 
how  the  „stability  and  permanence”  of  the  „collective  universe”  could  have  been  assured  forever 
through a „recurring change”.15 
In any case, his anthropic solution to the problem of the present state of the observed universe, and the 
scenario of a large but still local fluctuation in a „boundless universe” globally in the uniform state of 
maximum  entropy,  were  both  original.  The  author  proposed  them  on  several  occasions  presupposing 
that  the  existence  of  regions,  where  „the  conditions  necessary  for  life”  are  maintained  for  periods  of 
time long in comparison to human experience, represented a consistent scenario.16 Nonetheless Preston 
was accused of „confusion of reasoning and of unsoundness”17, forcing him to reply that his arguments 
implied no violation of the „existing physical principles” in the past and a satisfying „explanation for 
the existing state of things”.18 
A  new  version  of  Preston’s  scenario  was  indeed  re-proposed  less  than  two  decades  later  by  Ludwig 
Boltzmann. When this happened, the debate on the second Hauptsatz and the kinetic theory had already 
been significantly advanced. During the 1880s, in fact, theoretical physicists had to confront themselves 
with many experimental inconsistencies and with innumerable difficulties.19 
In the general debate on these topics particular relevance was reserved to the discussion of Boltzmann’s 
minimum  theorem.  This  important  mathematical  tool  represents  a  relevant  piece  of  the  history  of  the 
thermodynamics  of  irreversible  processes  and  has  been  studied  in  a  historical  perspective  on  various 
occasions.20 Here, I’ll limit myself to remember that Boltzmann’s minimum theorem, or H-theorem as it 
was  generally  known  after  189021,  stated  that  a  particular  function  describing  the  behaviour  of  the 
inverse of the entropy of a macroscopic isolated system (the H-function), must remain, for the greater 
part of time, at that minimum value which represents the state of maximum entropy. 
The  status  of  the  theorem  remained  unclear  and  raised  two  kind  of  controversies:  the  first,  directed 
basically  at  the  formal  aspects  of  the  theorem  involved  mainly  authors  of  English  language  and  took 
place  essentially  after  Boltzmann’s  participation  at  the  British  Association  meeting  held  in  Oxford  in 
August 1894; the second, more radical controversy concerned mainly German authors and was directed 
against the whole statistical interpretation of the second Hauptsatz and the probabilistic nature of the H-
theorem. 
The British controversy consisted in an exchange of letters and short contributions which appeared on 
the  pages  of  Nature  in  the  years  1894/1895.  It  was  in  this  context  that  Fitzgerald  question  about  the 
present  state  of  the  universe,  originally  raised at  the  Oxford  meeting,  was  re-proposed  by both  Bryan 
and Culverwell.22

In  the  February  28th,  1895  issue  of  Nature  Boltzmann  clarified  his  position  and  argued  that  the  H-
theorem  demanded  simply  „that  in  the  course  of  time  the  universe  must  tend  to  a  state  where  the 
average  vis  viva  of  every  atom  is  the  same”,  but  evidently  found  that  this  was  not  enough  to  evade 
Fitzgerald’s  objection.  Surely  he  was  worried  by  a  conception  which  presumed  a  very  special 
arrangement of the whole universe at a certain time (if not a very peculiar beginning), finding hard to 
reconcile it with the mechanical Weltbild. 
As  a  way  out  he  took  refuge  to  an  idea  attributed  to  his  „old  assistant”  Ignaz  Schütz23,  that  was 
expressed in the following terms24: 
 
We assume that the whole universe is, and rests forever, in thermal equilibrium. The probability that one (only 
one) part of the universe is in a certain state, is the smaller the farther this state is from thermal equilibrium; but 
this probability is greater, the greater the universe itself is. If we assume the universe great enough we can make 
the  probability  of  one  relatively  small  part  being  in  a  given  state  (however  far  from  the  state  of  thermal 
equilibrium), as great as we please. We can also make the probability great that, though the whole universe is so 
far from thermal equilibrium, our world is in its present state. It may be said that the world is so far from thermal 
equilibrium that we cannot imagine the improbability of such a state. but can we imagine, on the other side, how 
small a part of the whole universe this world is? Assuming the universe great enough, the probability that such a 
small part of it as our world should be in its present state, is no longer small. 
If this assumption were correct, our world would return more and more to thermal equilibrium; but because the 
whole universe is so great, it might be probable that at some future time some other world might deviate as far 
from  thermal  equilibrium  as  our  world  does  at  present.  Then  the  aforementioned  H-curve  would  form  a 
representation of what takes place in the universe. The summits of the curve would represent the worlds where 
visible motion and life exist. 
 
This  argument  was  repeated  by  Boltzmann  at  least  two  times  in  the  following  years.25  On  these  new 
occasions  the  author  no  longer  credited  Schütz,  and  presented  the  idea  of  fluctuations  of  cosmical 
proportions  as  his  personal  opinion.  This  presumably  was  a  consequence  of  the  polemical  exchange 
with Ernst Zermelo which had started in December 1895. 
It  is  well  known  that,  contrary  to  the  English  authors  that  participated  in  the  Nature  debate,  Zermelo 
didn’t try simply to eliminate the contradictions between the mechanistic foundations of the H-theorem 
and  the  irreversibility  of  entropy.  He  rather  affirmed  the  absolute  value  of  the  second  Hauptsatz, 
rejecting any mechanistic interpretation. 
The  specific  points  of  the  Zermelo/Boltzmann  controversy  have  been  told  many  times26,  but  what  is 
relevant  here  is  the  answer  of  Boltzmann  to  certain  „questions  of  principle”  [principielle  Fragen] 
advanced by his rival.27 

                                                 
23  According  to  Blackmore  “Boltzmann  was  rather  critical  of  Dr.  Schütz's  abilities”.  See:  Blackmore,  J.  (ed.):  Ludwig 
Boltzmann. His later life and philosophy, Dordrecht, 1995, p. 48. 
24  Boltzmann,  L.:  On  certain  questions  of  the  theory  of  gases,  Nature  51,  1895,  p.  413-415.  The  anthropic  nature  of 
Boltzmann’s  argument  was  underlined  for  instance  in  Davies,  P.C.W.:  The  accidental  …;  recently  it  has  been  discussed 
critically  in  Cirkovic,  M.M.:  Anthropic  fluctuations  vs.  weak  anthropic  principle,  physics  abstracts:  physics/0109072. 
According  to  Cirkovic,  Boltzmann  simply  stated  that  the  existence  of  intelligent  observers  implies  some  restrictions  on 
possible worlds but, nonetheless, he contradicted contemporary  formulation of the weak anthropic  principle.  The point is 
here  that  Boltzmann’s  hypothesis  doesn’t  accept    that    (cid:1)the  uniformity  of  laws  is  preserved  in  entire  spacetime  except  at 
initial (and possibly final) singularity”. 
Although it  invokes concepts unknown  in  Boltzmann’s  times,  this is  indeed  a  cogent  critic. Anyway, as Cirkovic himself 
suggests, we have to regard also the (cid:1)variation on the Boltzmann-Schuetz theme” that (cid:1)can be played within the multiverse 
framework,  in  which  our  existence  as  observers  selects  a  particular  domain”.  The  strict  alliance  between  early  anthropic 
proposals and many universes is indeed one of the main points touched in the present paper.

During  the  debate,  it  was  made  evident  that  a    non-contradictory  statistical  explanation  required  the 
adoption of an „unverifiable assumption” [unbeweisbare Annahme] according to which the universe, or 
at  least  a  very  large  part  of  it,  is  at  present  in  an  „improbable  state"  because  it  „began  from  a  very 
improbable state".28 Boltzmann found this conclusion, as everyone based on „special conceptions on the 
universe” [specielle Vorstellungen über das Universum], very unpleasant.29 According to him, in fact, 
there  was  another  conception  which  was  consistent  with  the  mechanical  representation  of  the  world, 
i.e.: that, suggested in the 1895 paper, of a universe globally in thermal equilibrium containing here and 
there „relatively small ambits” [verhältnissmässig kleine Bezirke] (called single worlds [Einzelwelten] 
and  imagined  of  „the  extension  of  our  stellar  space”  [der  Ausdehnung  unseres  Sternenraums])  which 
can be far from that state.30 
Such  a  scenario,  apart  from  evading  the  unsatisfactory  picture  of  an  unilateral  change  of  the  whole 
universe from a determined initial state to a final terminal state”, was considered by Boltzmann as the 
best image available of the “world as a mechanical system”.31 
 

3.ANTHROPIC SUGGESTIONS IN THE ERA OF THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE 

 
The  fundamental  characteristics  of  a  (general  relativistic)  mathematical  model  of  the  whole  universe 
became clear thanks to Einstein’s theory of gravitation and to the association between the revolutionary 
idea  of  an  expanding  universe  and  Hubble’s  empirical  law.  General  relativistic  cosmology  became 
indeed  centred  on  a  particular  class  of  space-times  of  constant  curvature:  those  which  are  spatially 
homogeneous and globally isotropic or, in other words, obey the cosmological principle. 
As  a  result,  after  the  general  acceptance  of  the  idea  of  an  expansion  of  space  in  1930,  many  reviews 
were published to point out the dynamical behaviour of the many possible homogeneous and isotropic 
universes  (the  Fridman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker  or  FLRW  universes)  which  are  regulated  by  that 
simplified version of Einstein’s equations known as Fridman’s equations.32

The (Preston)/Schütz/Boltzmann argument raised various critical reflections before 193033 and was then 
sometime  discussed  in  the  new  context  of  the  expanding  universe.  Some  authors  considered  it 
„completely false”34 because of the implausibility of a fluctuation as large as the region of space visible 
to Mount Wilson reflector35; others simply found it incomprehensible.36 Someone as influential as the 
British  biologist  John  Burdon  Sanderson  Haldane,  attributed  a  certain  relevance  to  Boltzmann’s 
hypothesis arguing that „in the course of eternity any event with finite probability will occur”.37 
Tolman recalled Boltzmann’s argument on 1931 in one of his enquiries on the meaning of the entropy 
of the universe in the context of a relativistic thermodynamics.38 There he remembered the old difficulty 
of classical thermodynamics expressed by Fitzgerald's question, confiding to have learnt Boltzmann’s 
answer through Tatiana Ehrenfest.39 Aiming at the foundation of a cogent relativistic thermodynamics, 
Tolman found all possible classical way outs, including Boltzmann’s, wrong or incomplete answers to 
the  above-mentioned  question.  Anyway,  he  depicted  the  „fluctuations  theory”  as  an  „important 
possibility” and an „important part” of any future „relatively complete treatment of the entropy of the 
universe”.40 
Coming from one of the most empirically oriented cosmologists41, this appreciation of the fluctuation 
hypothesis  cannot  be  a  coincidence.  Boltzmann’s  scenario,  transformed  by  Tolman  into  that  of  an 
inhomogeneous universe with no temporal beginning, represented indeed an alternative to those simple 
models  that,  as  FLRW  universes,  were  extrapolating  an  a  priori  assumption  of  spatial  homogeneity 
beyond the observable region. 
Tolman  considered  FLRW  universes  as  extraordinarily  important  geometrical  tools  in  virtue  of  their 
mathematical  simplicity,  but  he  was  always  clear  that  they  were  only  rough  idealizations  not  to  be 
confounded  with  the  actual  physical  universe.  In  1934  he  even  proposed  to  study  the  „effects  of 
inhomogeneity on the theoretical behaviour of cosmological models”, underlying the necessity of being 
not „too dogmatic” about accepting conclusions deducted from FLRW models.42

1930 Haldane’s book called The inequality of man and other essays, London 1932. The author calculated that an improbable 
distribution  as  that  requested  by  Boltzmann’s  thesis  was  so  improbable  to  demand  something  as  1010100
  years  to  happen. 
Notwithstanding he concluded that -in a truly cosmological perspective- the hypothesis of fluctuations represented the most 
reliable  explanation  of  the  apparent  contradiction  between  the  observed  state  of  the  universe  and  the  predictions  of 
thermodynamics.

United States of America  20,  1934, p. 169-176,  on p.  176. Tolman suggested also  the possibility  of a universe of variable 
curvature  with  open  and  closed  regions,  pointing  out  at  a  scenario  that  was  developed  both  in  Soviet  cosmological 
speculations and in various many universes proposals of the 1960ies.

Such an attitude echoed, probably without Tolman’s knowledge, that already suggested - not without a 
certain  polemical  vein  towards  Einstein’s  static  cosmology  -  by  Emile  Borel  in  the  1920ies.43  This 
French  author transformed  Boltzmann’s  argument  in  a  warning  according  to  which  „local  knowledge 
cannot give knowledge of the universe”.44 He then compared our conditions as Earth-based-observers to 
that  of  a  fictitious  inhabitant  of  a  drop  of  water  who  remains  unable  to  see  the  complexity  beyond 
his/her abode.45 
Anyway, apart from the reservations against the cosmological principle in its deductive formulation and 
the exploration of a model-universe inhomogeneous on a very large scale46, Tolman underlined also the 
anthropic  content  of  Boltzmann’s  hypothesis.  He  suggested  in  fact  implicitly  that  the  existence  of 
„sentient  beings”  represented  by  itself  a  valid  argument  against  the   „enormous  improbability”  of the 
requested fluctuation.47 
These  topics  (criticism  of  cosmological  deductivism,  proposal  of  an  inhomogeneous  scenario  and 
anthropic  justification  of  the  special  characteristics  of  our  observable  region)  were  all  revived  in  the 
mid 1950ies in a paper which appeared on the Newsletter of the astrophysical Institute of Kazakhstan 
and that was later considered by Ya.B. Zel'dovich as the first application of the anthropic principle in 
relativistic cosmology.48 
The  paper  in  question49,  called  Essential  features  of  the  astrophysical  observed  universe  as  typical 
properties of the inhabited cosmic system, was written in Russian by Grigory Moiseevich Idlis and was 
published in 1958 although the author remembers to have developed his ideas two years before.50 
Of course, we must consider Idlis’ paper at the light of both the status of the worldwide cosmological 
controversy  that  characterized  the  1950ies  and  of  the  peculiar  situation  of  the  whole  discipline  of 
relativistic  cosmology  in  the  USSR  a  few  years  after  the  death  of  Stalin.  As  practically  any  paper 
published  there,  Idlis’s  article  revealed  a  mutual  contamination  between  the  concepts  of  dialectical 
materialism  and  those  emerging  from  observational  and  theoretical  cosmology.51  Moreover,  it  shared 
with all the other Soviet papers devoted in some way to cosmology, the picture of a universe that was 
infinite52, eternal and inhomogeneous on a very large scale.53

inhomogeneity, Idlis stated in fact that the metagalactic space is one of negative curvature. 
53  This  last  characteristic  (inhomogeneity)  reflects  the  concept  of  a    structural  infinity  which  is  absent  in  the  simplified 
hypothesis  adopted in the  Western  cosmological models.  The concept is linked  to the dialectical materialism’s conception 
according  to  which  matter  is  inhexhaustible  and  exposed  to  a  qualitative  development.  It  is  also  linked  to  the  hierarchic

Idlis  anyway  accepted  the  general  relativistic  interpretation  of  the  red-shifts,  limiting  himself  to  raise 
objections  against  the  linearity  of  the  velocity-distance  relation.  As  usual  he  referred  to  the  observed 
expanding part of the universe as the metagalaxy54, suggesting to consider it a very peculiar region of 
the infinite universe; i.e.: a particular system of galaxies, extended over at least five billion light years 
and  approaching  in  first  approximation  an  isotropic  and  homogeneous  cosmological  model  with 
characteristic age, average density, average temperature and expansion rate. 
The  heart  of  Idlis’  monography  consisted  in  connecting  the  „characteristic  features”  of  the  observed 
region of the universe to the properties necessary for the rise, evolution and maintenance of life.55 
Idlis considered, firstly, the conditions necessary for the emergence of life on a local astronomical scale 
(a typical work in what today we would call astrobiology, in the spirit of many classic papers of Idlis' 
mentor:  Vasilii  Grigor'evich  Fesenkov56).  In  the  second  part  of  his  paper  the  Soviet  astronomer  then 
discussed  the  properties  necessary  for  the  emergence  of  life  in  the  large  structure  of  the  universe, 
pointing  out  the  peculiarity  of  an  approach  which  was  looking  for  a  „coherent  solution”  of  the 
properties of the observed region from the „fact itself of our existence”.57 
At  last,  he  concluded  that  any  typical  inhabited  system  would  have  shared  with  our  observable 
expanding metagalaxy the fact of necessarily being an „isolated" region of the universe endowed with 
an appropriate age, density, temperature and chemical composition. 
Following Boltzmann, he stated moreover that there was no reason for appealing to „anomalous initial 
conditions” of the whole universe. In fact, maintaining that living beings can observe only  regions of 
the universe that do possess the properties of a typical habitated system and not a region whatever in the 
„infinite multiformity” of the universe, we have no right to extrapolate the properties of our observable 
region to the whole.58 
In his rehabilitation of Boltzmann’s hypothesis, Idlis rejected the objections expressed in name of the 
improbability  of  a  fluctuation  of  cosmical  proportion  by  Soviet  authors  as  Bronstein,  Landau  and 
Zel’manov.59  He  remarked  that  the  existence  of  a    „thinking  being”  does  not  simply  demand  the 
„appearance  of  an  habitable  solar  system”,  but  rather  implies  as  a  rule  the  generation  of  a  very  large 
quantity  of  uninhabitable  planetary  systems,  stars  and  galaxies.  Therefore,  in  conclusion,  Idlis 
suggested that the realization of fluctuations „initially devoid of structure” on a metagalactic scale was 
not  so  unlikely  and  presumably  „necessary  for  the  appearance  of  the  living  beings  that  observe  the 
picture of the world extending before us”.60 
                                                                                                                                                                       
universe scenario which was appreciated in the Soviet Union as a way out of Olbers’ paradox in the context of an infinite 
universe. Cf. Idlis, G.M.: (cid:23)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:19)(cid:24) (cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:14)(cid:25)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:19) (cid:19) (cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:26)(cid:20)(cid:11)(cid:26)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:24) (cid:13)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:25) (cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:8)(cid:14)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:18) [The theory of relativity and 
the structural infinity of the universe], Astronomicheskii Zhurnal 33, 1956, p. 622-626. 
54 The term metagalaxy concerns here the expanding system of galaxies in the observable part of the universe. It was adopted 
by Lundmark and Shapley in the 1920ies to avoid any ambiguous expression regarding an unobservable whole. Later it was 
used  by  different critics  of  FLRW  cosmology  (as, for instance, the followers  of  Klein-Alfven cosmology) and also in the 
papers  of  astronomers  not  inclined  to  cosmological  speculations  (just  to  quote  an  example,  Vera  Rubin  adopted  it  in  her 
celebrated Rubin V.C.: Differential rotation of the inner metagalaxy, Astronomical Journal 56, 1951, p. 47). 
55  Life  was  seen  here  as  a  „regular  exit  of  matter  evolution".  Idlis  (on  p.  55  of  his  1958  paper)  adopted  Oparin’s 
interpretation of the definition of life given in Engels’ Dialectic of nature. In such a perspective life represents a special form 
of the movement of matter or, in other words, an emerging quality that comes out from the movement of matter at a certain 
stage. Cf. Oparin, A.I.- Fesenkov, V.G.: Life in the universe, New York 1961 (Russian original 1956).(cid:4)
56  Fesenkov  and  Idlis  were  very  close  to  each  other.  In    the  late  1930ies  Fesenkov  suffered  as  many  other  astronomers 
persecutions that comported  his  dismissal  from the  position  of  chairman  of the  Astronomical  Council  in  1937.  In   1941 -
during second world war - Fesenkov was then extradited to Kazakhstan’s capital, Almaty. There he was able to organize a 
new  institute  of  astronomy.  Idlis  became  the  new  director  of  the  Institute  after  Fesenkov  moved  to  Moscow.  Later,  Idlis 
moved to Moscow too, and began to work for the History of Science’s Institute.

58 Ibid., p. 52 
59 Apart from his criticism against Boltzmann’s argument, Abram Leonidovich Zel'manov made some interesting anthropic 
considerations in his writings. He suggested in fact not only a predisposition of the properties of the metagalaxy respect to 
the development of life, but even the existence of „qualitatively different” areas of the metauniverse. He argued moreover 
that other universes (if they exist at all) could be doomed to evolve without witnesses. Contrary to Idlis, Zel’manov did not 
formulate  his ideas quantitatively.  This was  probably due to the fact that, because of his Hebrew origins, he found it very 
hard to publish in astronomical journals (still being able, however, to exert a certain influence on his colleagues).

Idlis’  ideas  came  out  almost  simultaneously  with  the  papers  of  Gerald  James  Whitrow  and  Robert 
Henry Dicke; two authors very far from Idlis’ materialistic attitude that advanced anthropic answers to 
some old problems, yet sustaining at the same time evolutionary FLRW cosmology. 
Whitrow, in particular, proposed an anthropic resolution of the venerable philosophical question Why 
physical  space  has  three  dimensions?61  (arguing  that  with  a  space  of  different  dimensionality  there 
would  be  no  living  being  to  pose  the  question)  and,  similarly  to  Idlis,  alluded  around  1955  to  an 
anthropic  explanation  of  the  size  of  the  observable  universe.  Anyway  he  never  published  these  last 
ideas, which were developed years later by Wheeler.62 The only reference to Whitrow’s argument that 
appeared  in  print  during  the  1950ies  seems  to  be  that  due  to  the  philosopher  of  religion  Eric  Lionel 
Mascall, who attributed to the English’s mathematician that63 
 
it  may  be  necessary  for  the  universe  to  have  the  enormous  size  and  complexity  which  modern  astronomy  has 
revealed, in order for the earth to be a possible habitation for living beings. 

4.THE EPOCH OF MAN 

 
The decade that began in 1953 saw a renaissance64 of gravitational research. Controversy between the 
general relativistic evolutionary cosmology and the steady-state one was „most intense".65 Among the 
basic events of that period one may count: 

- 
- 

- 

 Rindler’s paper on horizons66;  
 Ryle’s results on the distribution of radiosources (which testified the first strong observational 
evidence against steady-state cosmology67);  
the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis developed by Hoyle, Fowler and the Burbridges, that was 
accompanied  by  Hoyle’s  anthropic  prediction  of  a  12C  resonance  level  around  7,68  MeV68  (a

68  Hoyle’s  prediction  of  this  particular  resonance  level  of  carbon-12  has  been  often  regarded  as  an  anthropic  one.  In  the 
course of his enquiries on stellar nucleosynthesis, Hoyle considered the reaction that bring to the formation of 12C from three 
4He nuclei, and deduced that  it depends crucially  on the existence  of an energy  level  of  12C (the 7,656  one) which  is  just 
above the rest mass of a  8Be nucleus and a  4He nucleus. He was then amazed by the consequences  of this coincidence. In 
fact, if it was not for that particular resonance level, carbon would be extremely rare in the universe. But it was not all: Hoyle 
noted moreover that 16O presented a peculiar resonance level too (the 7,1616 MeV level). If this last energy level was just a 
little higher, almost all the 12C would have been turned in oxygen. 
In the Mid 1960ies (Hoyle, F.: Galaxies, nuclei and quasars, London 1965, ch. VI), Hoyle argued that these coincidences 
could be typical of our part of the universe and suggested that in other portions of the universe, the resonance levels could be

result  that  was  indeed  presented  already  in  1953  after  a  „private  communication”  of  Hoyle 
himself69);  
a certain debate on Gamow’s theory of creation, followed by all the puzzles and the suspicious 
remarks raised by the conception of a radical violation of physical laws and energy conservation 
in an initial singularity.  

The  dispute  between  the  rival  theories  of  cosmology  was  not  the  only  open  front.  Of  considerable 
interest  to  cosmologists  of  any  school  was  the  old  problem  of  the  coincidences  between  large 
dimensionless  numbers,  obtained  through  the  combination  of  some  fundamental  quantities  of  physics 
and cosmology. This problem was crucial already for Weyl70, few years after the formulation of general 
relativity, and became largely known thanks to Eddington and Dirac.71 
Motivated by the peculiar coincidence in order of magnitude between the age of the universe expressed 
in atomic units72, H0
-1[(mpc2p)/h]  (which is at present a pure number of order 1039), and the large pure 
number of order 1039 given by e2/(Gmpme), Dirac advanced in the 1930ies a new basis for cosmology. 
This was based on the „fundamental principle” (which was later renamed the large number hypothesis, 
or  LNH  for  short)  according  to  which  all  dimensionless  numbers  of  order  (1039)n  must  vary 
proportionally to the n-th power of the age of the universe expressed in atomic units. 
As  a  particular  consequence  of  this  cosmological  principle  we  have  that  the  number  given  by 
e2/(Gmpme) - or, analogously, what we today call the reciprocal of the dimensionless gravitational fine 
2) - should vary with the age of the universe. It follows then that 
structure constant, aG
at least one of the presumed constants must vary, changing approximately73 as a simple function of the 
age of the universe.

placed differently, with the result of having no living creatures around. He consequently presented a cosmological scenario 
according  to  which  (cid:1)the  universe  would  be  far  richer  in  its  possibilities  and  content  than  we  normally  imagine.  In  other 
regions the numbers would be different and the gross properties of matter, the science of chemistry for example, would be 
entirely changed" (Hoyle, F.: Recent developments in cosmology, Nature 208, 1965, p. 111-114, on p. 114). 
Of course, Hoyle preferred a similar scenario to the eventuality of some sort of finality in nature. Still worried by teleology 
he successively rejected the anthropic principle as a sort of blind alley. Anyway, he confessed at least once to be against the 
support offered by the anthropic principle to the big bang religion, rather than against the strong anthropic principle in itself 
(Hoyle,  F.:  The  Anthropic  and  perfect  cosmological  principles/similarities  and  differences,  unpublished  manuscript  of  the 
talk presented at the second Venice conference on cosmology and philosophy on November 1988). For some recent analysis

Dirac  suggested  that  there  was  one  changing  constant  and  that  this  was  G.  This  launched  a  debate 
beyond  the  narrower  domain  of  theoretical  physics  which  became  particularly  intense  during  the 
1950ies.74 
Of  particular  interest  was  of  course  Dicke’s  treatment,  which  emerged  from  a  deep  analysis  of  the 
foundations  of  general  relativity  and  of  any  gravitational  theory  which  could  represent  a  reliable 
alternative to Einstein’s. 
Dicke  also  invented  the  microwave  radiometer  and  described  the  cosmic  background  radiation 
discovered by Penzias and Wilson in 1964 as relic of the primeval fireball. At about 1955 he dedicated 
himself to the development of experimental tests of gravity, evaluating the existing proofs in favour of 
general relativity and submitting to a severe analysis Einstein’s principle of equivalence. 
The  eventuality  of  a  varying  G  surely  intrigued  him  (as  the  Brans/Dicke  theory  testifies),  but  at  the 
same  time  he  surely  didn’t  share  Dirac’s  rationalistic  approach  to  mathematical  physics  with  his 
invocation to „elegance, simplicity and perfection”.75 
-1 and the present age of the universe, Dicke concluded that 
As to the peculiar coincidence between aG
there was no need at all to invoke a variability of G. To explain that coincidence it was in fact sufficient 
to re-consider the statistical premises of Dirac’s reasoning, without indulging in conclusions based on 
aesthetic  criteria.  In  short,  while  for  Dirac  the  present  epoch  has  obtained  completely  fortuitous; 
according  to  Dicke  the  age  „now”  is  „not random"  but  rather „conditioned"  by  „biological factors"76, 
because we can say in advance that the existence of observers (i.e.: carbon based life forms) is allowed 
only on a limited temporal range of the evolutionary history of the universe.  
Dicke  stated  that  we  (and  whatever  chemically  complex  alien  civilization)  may  observe  the  universe 
only  in  those  epochs  that  present  the  necessary  conditions  for  our  own  existence  since  1957,  but  the 
clearest (although probably the less known) illustration of his argument was advanced in occasion of the 
Joseph Henry Lecture held in front of the Philosophical Society of Washington on April 18, 1958. There 
he affirmed77: 
 
To  infer  the  time  dependence  of  the  gravitational  interaction  requires  more  than  a  simple  observation  that  the 
reciprocal  of  the  gravitational  constant  and  the  age  of  the  universe,  when  expressed  dimensionlessly,  are  now 
nearly equal. It is also necessary to assume that now is a random time. But is it? 
The  present  epoch  is  conditioned  by  the  fact  that  the  biological  conditions  for  the  existence  of  man  must  be 
satisfied.  This  requires  the  existence  of  a  planetary  system  and  a  hot  star.  If  we  assume  an  evolutionary 
cosmology starting with the formation of hydrogen 12 billion years ago, there is an upper limit for the epoch of 
man which is imposed by the following two conditions: First, hydrogen is being continually converted to helium 
and heavier elements. Perhaps 20% has already been "burned." Second, there is an upper limit on the radiating 
life of a star. 
If the star is massive (10 times the sun's mass) it lives riotously, burning its hydrogen like a wastrel. For a light 
star (1/10 the sun's mass), hydrogen is burned slowly and the star is capable of living much longer than the sun, 
                                                 
74  Among  the  innumerable  contributions  to  a  question  which  posed  more  interrogatives  than  solutions,  Jordan  proposed 
various cosmological models inspired by Dirac’s LNH; Bondi discussed widely the topic of large numbers coincidences in 
his classic textbook Cosmology; Hoyle affronted the theme in many occasions; Oskar Klein tried to elaborate a solution in 
the context of a cosmological model completely different from both evolutionary and steady-state theories. See the sources 
quoted on n. 65 above for further details.

76  Ibid., p. 375. A similar  argument was almost incidentally delineated by Eddington  in his Messengers Lectures  of 1934. 
Discussing the eventuality  of (cid:1)a fortuitous deviation of entropy from its maximum value”, he said: (cid:1)the year 1934 is not a 
random  date  between t=-¥ and t=+¥. We  must not argue that because fluctuations  of the  present  magnitude  occupy  only 
1/xth  of  the  time  between  t=-¥  and  t=+¥,  therefore  the  chances  are  x  to  1  against  such  a  fluctuation  existing  in  the  year 
1934.  For  our  present  purpose  the  important  characteristic  of  the  year  1934  is  that  it  is  selected  as  belonging  to  a  period 
during which there exist in the universe beings capable of speculating about the universe and its fluctuations. It is clear that 
such  creatures  could  not  exist  near  thermodynamical  equilibrium.  Therefore  it  is  perfectly  fair  for  the  supporters  of  this 
suggestion  to  wipe  out  of  the  calculation  all  those  multillions  of  years  during  which  the  fluctuations  are  less  than  the 
minimum  required  to  permit  of  the  evolution  and  the  existence  of  mathematical  physicists".  See  Eddington,  A.S.:  New 
pathways in science, Cambridge 1935, p. 65(cid:3)

100 times as long. However, if the star is much smaller than this, its central temperature never rises high enough 
to cause nuclear reactions to take place. Such a light star radiates until its gravitational energy is gone and then it 
cools off. It is seen therefore that the longest life of a star is very roughly 1014 years and this puts an upper limit to 
the epoch of man. 
There  is  also  a  lower  limit  on  the  epoch  of  man.  With  the  assumption  that  initially  only  hydrogen  exists,  it  is 
necessary  to  produce  other  elements  in  the  stellar  caldrons  and  distribute  them  about  the  universe  before  a 
planetary  system of our type can be formed.  It is a bit difficult to estimate this  time, but it would seem that 1

on 
It is thus seen that the epoch of man is not random but is very roughly delineated. 
 
The consecration of the abovementioned argument came only after the publication of a letter by Dicke 
in  the  November  4,  1961  issue  of  Nature.  That  letter,  where  the  Princeton’s  physicist  gave  to  his 
arguments a definite mathematical formulation, is now very famous among scholars, especially for that 
passage  stating  that  the  Hubble  age  of  the  universe  „is  not  a  ‘random  choice’  from  a  wide  range  of 
possible choices, but is limited by the criteria for the existence of physicists”.78 
Dirac replied immediately79 and – although admitting not to have a „decisive argument” against Dicke’s 
„assumption”  –  wrote  in  favour  of  his  LNH  because  it  enabled  an  indefinite  existence  of  habitable 
planets and the consequent possibility of a never ending life.80 
Preferring  a  theory  that admits an eternal  presence  of life in the  universe  could appear  curious,  but  it 
surely  wasn’t  a  new  argument.  For  instance,  Tolman  called  the  eventual  reduction  of  humanity  to  a 
„transitory and improbable phenomenon“ an „emotional" (rather than intellectually founded) objection 
to  Boltzmann’s  hypothesis81,  while  Sciama  confessed  around  1960  that  one  of  the  „most  important” 
issue in favour of the steady-state was that of being „the only model in which it seems evident that life 
will continue somewhere”.82 
Dicke, on his part, argued in retrospect to have suggested a „very conservative statement” to a „rather 
straightforward  question”.83  Also,  when  his  argument  became  known  as  an  application  of  the  weak 
anthropic principle, he affirmed that there was nothing of particularly „exciting” in it when confronted 
with the idea of a „natural selection of the natural constants” that was contemplated some years later by 
Brandon Carter.84 
  

5. BECOMING AWARE OF THE DELICATE BALANCE 

 
The 1960ies saw the gradual affirmation of the standard general relativistic hot big bang model as the 
result  of  various  factors.  Apart  from  the  already  mentioned  evidences  deriving  from  the  surveys  of 
distant  radiosources  and  the  accumulation  of  other  astrophysical  evidence  (concerning  quasars,  X-ray 
sources,  etc.)  the  two  basic  proofs  that  corroborated  the  model  were  the  theoretical  capacity  of

79 Dirac’s reply follows immediately after Dicke’s letter on Nature 192, 1961, p. 441. 
80  It  seems  pretty  absurd  that  the  hopes  of  Dirac,  that  Carter  in  recent  times  pitilessly  called  an  „error  of  blatant  wishful 
thinking"  (Carter,  B.:  The  anthropic  principle:  self-selection  as  an  adjunct  to  natural  selection,  in:  Cosmic  perspectives,  
Biswas, S.K.–Malik,  D.C.V.  –  Vishveshwara, C.V. -eds.-, Cambridge  1988,  p. 183-204,   on  p.  188),  were lately  made an 
anthropic  principle  by  Tipler  (i.e.:  the  so  called  Final  Anthropic  Principle).  This    FAP  has  said  to  be  based  on  the  most 
beautiful of all physical postulates: „total death is not unavoidable". Cf. for instance Tipler, F.J.: The Omega Point theory: A 
model of an evolving God, in: Physics, philosophy and theology: A common quest for understanding, Russell, R.J. –Stoeger,

predicting  the  observed  abundances  of  light  atomic  nuclei  and  the  discovery  of  the  microwave 
background  radiation.  Together  with  (or:  as  part  of)  the  newly  emerging  paradigm,  the  period  was 
characterized  by  an  increasing  rapprochement  between  cosmology  and  particle  physics  and  by  the 
formulation  of  the  essential  mathematical  background  needed  for  the  study  of  the  causal  structure  of 
space-time and the meaning of singularities. 
A particularly important centre for the development of new ideas, methods and techniques was surely 
Cambridge’s  DAMTP  (Department  of  Applied  Mathematics  and  Theoretical  Physics)  where  a  new 
generation  of  researchers  (including  Hawking,  Rees  and  Ellis)  developed  new  ideas  under  the 
supervision  of  Dennis  Sciama.  Because  of  the  presence  of  Hoyle  and  the  inheritance  of  people  like 
Eddington  and  Dirac,  Cambridge  already  represented  an  ideal  place  for  cosmological  studies.85 
Sciama’s  relativity  group  gathered  some  of  the  best  minds  assuring  them  „a  certain  structure  and 
someone who was willing to take them on”.86 
Carter was one of Sciama’s students: born in Sydney in 1942, he arrived at DAMTP around 1964 and 
got his Ph.D. in applied mathematics and theoretical physics in 1968. The largest part of his published 
papers  of  the  1960ies  and  early  1970ies  were  dedicated  to  the  Kerr  solutions  of  Einstein’s  field 
equations (i.e: those exact solutions that describe the field of rotating black holes) or to other technical 
problems related with the global properties of exact solutions in general relativity. In these fields Carter 
obtained relevant results, including a theorem that now bears his name87 and the demonstration of the 
existence of a family of charged Kerr solutions.88 
In 1967 Carter drew up a long type-written preprint devoted to the role of fundamental microphysical 
parameters  in  cosmogony  which  remained  unpublished.89  This  was  conceived  as  the  first  part  of  a 
projected  work  (called  the  significance  of  numerical  coincidences  in  nature)  aimed  to  furnish  an 
„unified  treatment”  and  a  „readily  accessible  and  comprehensible”  survey  of  numerical  coincidences 
emerging from physics and astrophysics. In short, the paper represented a stimulating exercise of what 
Victor  Weisskopf  would  call  qualitative  physics90:  a  genre  of  physical  discussion  which  had  some 
forerunners (from Galilei’s reflections on the size of the animals attributed to Salviati in the second day 
of his Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche91 to Edwin E. Salpeter’s speculations of the mid 1960ies)92 
and a long list of successors93 and that, in Carter's words, concerned „the manner in which familiar local

The author explored in particular the role and consequences of a series of „relations and coincidences" 
obtained through the composition of the following six fundamental parameters:

the ratio between the difference between neutron and proton mass and the mass of the nucleon,

From the interplay of these parameters it is possible to show not only that the sizes and masses of the 
planets  and  the  stars  must  lie  in  certain  typical  ranges,  but  that  they  have  a  fundamental  role  in 
determining „the character of all important natural phenomena” with the exception of those where high 
energy  physics  or  cosmological  quantities  are  directly  involved.  Carter  showed  how  (apart  from 
„relatively small adjustment factors”) most of the „limiting masses of astrophysics arise (in fundamental 
units) simply as the reciprocal of the gravitational fine structure constant”. There was only one notable 
exception, and to point this out represented the most significant result reached in the 1967 unpublished 
paper. 
This  exception  concerns  the  positioning  of  the  dividing  line  which  distinguishes  main  sequence  stars 
(i.e.: stable hydrogen’s burning stars) that transport energy mainly by convection (i.e.: red dwarfs) from 
those  in  which  energy  is  dissipated  mainly  by  radiative  transport  (i.e.:  blue  giants).99    Carter  showed 
that this line „occurs within the range of main sequence stars only as a consequence of the rather exotic 
coincidence  that  the  ninth  power  of  the  electromagnetic  fine  structure  constant  [i.e.:  e2  in  Carter’s 
notation]  is  roughly  equal  to  the  square  root  of  the  gravitational  fine  structure  constant”100.  This 
coincidence  implied  indeed  a  delicate  balance.    „Had  it  been  the  11th  power",  he  wrote,  „all  main 
sequence  stars  would  be  convective  red  dwarfs”.  This  observation,  which  prompted  some  crucial 
developments, will be re-considered below.

94 Carter aimed also to distinguish those features of large-scale phenomena „which do not depend critically” on the values of 
fundamental parameters, from „those which depend on numerical coincidences”.

Dirac’s LNH) to give an explanation of that large-number coincidence which relates the upper limit of

Although  this  coincidence  was  a  genuine  finding,  there  was  no  need  to  postulate  any  new  physics  to 
explain it. Jordan’s coincidence is in fact predictable in terms of the ordinary theory of stellar evolution, 
taking into account that the masses of stable stars are necessarily related to the Landau/Chandrasekhar 
limiting  mass.102    It  is  enough  to  realize  that  „no  normal  stable  star  can  exist  with  a  nucleon  number

which differs from the Landau number [N  L ” ML/MN ” MN

In  other  words  we  cannot  have  the  formation  of  a  star  with  M  <<  ML,  because  if  that  were  the  case 
gravity would be balanced by quantum mechanical pressure due to the exclusion principle as it actually 
happens in the case of planets. At the same time we cannot have the formation of a star with M > 102ML 
because such an object would be very unstable due to the predominance of radiation pressure.

Brandon  Carter  himself  does  not  remember  today  what  happened  to  the  second  part  of  his  1967 
paper.104  We  know  anyway  that  his  „ultimate  purpose”  was  there  „to  clarify  the  significance”  of  the 
coincidence between aG
According  to  Carter,  that  coincidence  should  have  been  „fully  explained  in  principle  (although  many 
relevant  details  remain  uncalculable  in  practice)  in  terms  of  conventional  physics  and  cosmology" 
without  the  recourse  to  „revolutionary  departures"  such  as  the  LNH  or  Eddington’s  Fundamental 
Theory.  Programmatically  he  then  stated  that  the  „final  task”  of  the  1967  preprint  was  to  furnish  the 
formulae  which  illustrate  the  „connection  between  local  and  cosmological  quantities  …  via  the 
timescales of stellar evolution” in terms of microphysical parameters. 
If not the second part of that paper, the promised follow-up came out three years later in the form of a 
new 13-page-typescript for the Clifford Memorial Meeting held at Princeton University on February 21, 
1970.    On  that  occasion,  with  Wheeler  and  Dyson  in  the  audience,  Carter  expressed  the  purpose  to 
„clarify”  the  „various  much  publicised”  large  number  coincidences  „in  terms  of  standard  physical 
theory in conjunction with the orthodox hot big bang model of the universe”.106 
He  classified  the  „coincidences  and  interrelations"  amongst  the  large  adimensional  numbers  of 
„cosmogonical” interest in three distinct categories: 
-  The  first  one  included  coincidences  whose  explanation  was  accounted  for  completely  in  terms  of 
“objective certainties” (i.e.: without requiring any recourse to „statistical probabilities") without leaving 
current physics and astrophysics. Jordan's coincidence represented an example of this category.

103 This is in fact a very high upper limit, since a more detailed calculation shows that a stable stars more massive than 40ML 
might hardly be possible.

-  „Category  (II)"  contemplated  „those  coincidences  whose  explanation,  although  straightforward, 
requires  subjective  and  probabilistic  considerations  relating  to  our  own  position  as  observers  in  the 
universe”. It included, of course, the Dirac/Dicke coincidence.107 
- To category (III) belonged: 
 
those  coincidences  which  cannot  be  given  a  direct  physical  explanation  since  they  depend  more  or  less  critically  on  the 
actual values  of fundamental or microphysical constants, but which nevertheless could in principle  have been predicted in 
advance of their observational discovery on the ground that they are necessary preconditions for the existence of observers 
(ourselves) in the universe. 
 
As example of this kind of coincidences Carter invoked the relation elaborated by Sciama on 1953 in 
his analysis on an inertial induction law of Mach’s type108: 
 
Gr0H0
 
According to Carter, this expression109 „could have been predicted from the conventional idea that the 
density  irregularities  in  the  form  of  galaxies,  stars  etc,  which  are  presumably  necessary  for  our  own 
existence, grew from initially small perturbations of the homogeneous background”. 
Once accepted the „conventional” theory according to which galaxies form by condensation, starting as 
small density fluctuations of the homogeneous FLRW background, the task became to make evident the 
biological  constraints  that  the  fact  itself  of  our  existence  (being  the  growing  of  initial  density 
irregularities, and hence the formation of galaxies, a necessary pre-condition for the emergence of life), 
imposes not simply on our temporal location in the universe but on some fundamental characteristics of 
the universe itself. In this case, Carter firstly choose two „independent constants” which are responsible 
of the dynamics of the FLRW background (and consequently of the temporal evolution of parameters 
such as the Hubble constant H, the curvature K, the average density r and the black body temperature 
T):  
- 
the ratio between the baryon number density (which is a conserved quantity) and the third power 
of the cosmological black body temperature in a certain time (cid:27) ” nb/T3 (which „represents roughly the 
ratio of the mean non relativistic gas pressure to the electromagnetic black body radiation”) 
- 
He  then  pointed  out  at  the  fact  that,  according  to  the  Fridman  equations,  we  may  have  Sciama’s 
coincidence only if curvature does not dominate on matter density at present time, and argued at last the 
biological constraints on (cid:28) deriving from the need that density irregularities transformed effectively in 
galaxies at some moment of the evolutionary history of the universe.

existence of observers to the „observed value of the cosmological time”, suggesting some further cosmological insights and 
founding a reason to reject by principle not only Dirac’s „revolutionary departure from orthodox physical theory” but also 
any form of steady-state theory that postulates an independence between the age of the universe and the Hubble constant.

Sciama,  D.:  The  unity  of  the  universe,  London  1959.  As  for  the  case  of  Eddington,  Dirac  and  Jordan,  Carter  learned  of 
Sciama’s coincidence by Bondi’s treatment in Cosmology (Bondi, H.: Cosmology, second edition, Cambridge 1961). Carter 
affirmed then, in 1973, that an anthropic explanation would not have „ruled out here the possibility (or desiderability)” of a 
Machian framework underlying ordinary gravitational theory. See: Carter, B.: Large number coincidences and the anthropic 
principle in cosmology, in: Confrontation of cosmological theories with observational data, Longair, M.S. (ed.), Dordrecht 
1974, p. 291-298, on p. 295.

110  A  similar  discussion  is  available  in  Carter,  B.:  Large  number  coincidences…,  p.  293/295,  where  the  attention  is 
concentrated on the total lifetime of closed universes which come out from the radiation era and are then regulated by the 
dominant  contribution  of  matter  density.  The  implicit  preference  for  the  closed  case  was  supported  by  observational  data 
practically  until  the  publication  of  Gott  III  J.R.-Gunn,  J.  E.-Schramm  D.N.-Tinsley,  B.M.:  An  unbound  universe?, 
Astrophysical Journal 194, 1974, p. 543-553. Since then the majority of cosmologists began to prefer the open universe in 
the face of observational evidence, although sometimes invoking the flat case for theoretical reasons (as those suggested by 
many inflationary models).

To guarantee the growth of density irregularities, Carter firstly underlined that one must allow for the 
decoupling  of  matter  from  radiation  pressure;  an  event  that  requires  that  T  drops  „well  below"111  the 
Rydberg  ionization  energy.112  Additionally,  he  noticed  that  one  must  have  the  curvature  K  not  too 
different in order of magnitude from the density at the time of decoupling. In fact, if K had had „a too 
strongly  negative  value”  the  kinetic  energy  of  expansion  would  have  dominated  the  potential  energy, 
making impossible the re-contraction of the perturbations under the action of gravity and causing their 
dispersal  together  with  the  expansion  of  the  universe.  If,  to  the  contrary,  K  had  had  a  too  strongly 
positive value it would have provoked an early contraction of the whole universe, with the consequent 
destruction of the developing condensations. 
In  the  light  of  these  two  considerations  Carter  concluded  that  our  existence  (or  if  you  want:  the 
possibility of galaxy formation) imposes the inequality (in Planck’s units) 

|(cid:28)| << 10-2e4me((cid:27)mN+10-2e4me) 
 
in  order  to  restrict  the  present  value  of  K  so  to  account  for  Sciama’s  coincidence  within  the 
observational accuracy available. 
He also suggested that the coincidence between the number of baryons in the visible universe and the 
-1,  which  had  become  famous  through  Eddington’s  papers,  appeared  as  a  consequence  of 
square  of  aG
Sciama’s relation once the present age of the universe was accounted for.113 
Apart from these rather technical details a crucial aspect was, at any rate, Carter’s awareness that it was 
hard  to  ascribe  the  status  of  a  proper  physical  explanation  to  the  arguments  exploited  to  predict 
Sciama’s relation. Physicists were used to extend the available knowledge in order to derive parameters 
previously taken as fundamental from „something more basic”, but this surely wasn't the case here.  
It is at this point that the concept of an „ensemble of universes” appeared for the first time, invoked as 
an  essential  element  to  promote  the  kind  of  reasoning  illustrated  above  in  the  case  of  the  growth  of 
density irregularities – which is often labelled as an anthropic prediction – to the status of explanation. 
Carter wrote114: 

However it is worth bearing in mind that all category III predictions can be raised automatically to the status of 
genuine explanations if we are willing to adopt some sort of statistical world-ensemble philosophy. In this type of  
philosophy one postulates the existence of an ensemble of universes characterized by all possible combinations 
of initial conditions and fundamental constants (the distinction between these concepts, which is not at all clear 
cut,  being  that  the  former  refer  to  essentially  local  and  the  latter  to  essentially  global  features)  with  some 
probability measure, the assignment of which presents a deep problem. The measure problem can however be by-
passed to a considerable extent, because the existence of any organism describable as an observer will only be 
conceivable for certain restricted combinations of the fundamental constants, which distinguish within the world-
ensemble an exceptional cognizable subset, to which our own universe must necessarily belong. (more detailed, 
but for practical purposes unfeasible, consideration of the detailed local conditions would distinguish within the 
cognizable subset a cognate subset in which observers actually occur.) A category III prediction is equivalent to a 
demonstration that the  features under consideration is common to all members of  the cognisable  subset,  which 
thus explains why it is present in our own universe. 
 
With the introduction of this world-ensemble philosophy Carter attempted to define no less than a new 
goal to physical inquiry. He described it as the aim to show that115: 

                                                 
111 „well below” means here „several powers of ten”, Cf. Carter, B.: Large number coincidences…, p. 294. 
112 Which is ½ e4me in Planck’s units. Cf. Misner, C.W.-Thorne, K.-Wheeler, J.A.: Gravitation, …, chapter 28. 
113  Of  course  this  not  furnish  yet  an  answer  on  the  particular  order  of  magnitude  of  aG
-1.  Carter  will  look  for  „a  possible 
explanation” of that large number recurring to a world-ensemble philosophy. His treatment of Eddington’s coincidence was 
extended in Carter, B.: Large number coincidences…, p. 294/295. 
114 I’ll follow here the original paper in adopting underscorings. 
115  Carter  noted  anyway  that  the  aim  to  reduce  „all  the  main  global  constants  from  fundamental  to  derived  status”  in  a 
„completely satisfactory” manner was largely illusory „because of the lack of a hard and fast distinction between global and 
local parameters”. The same distinction between initial conditions and fundamental constants was then unclear because the 
first appealed to essentially local and the latter to essentially global characteristics.

the cognizable subset is so closely circumscribed that the principal global constants, while remaining genuinely 
fundamental, are nevertheless forced to have values very close to those actually observed. 
 
In practice this appears as a „very hard” task, but what is relevant here is above all a matter of principle. 
Once  accepted as  a  premise  that  some  characteristics (as,  for  instance, the  fact  of  being composed  of 
chemical elements produced in stellar interiors or the need for habitable planets steadily heated by stars) 
must  be  common  prerequisites  for  the    existence  of  all  the  possible  forms  of  intelligent  life  in  the 
universe,  we  could  concentrate  ourselves  on  finding  „a  fairly  complete  system  of  restrictions  on  the 
values  of  fundamental  constants”.  In  other  words  we  could  think  to  collect  all  the  „necessary 
restrictions” that the presence of biological complexity imposes on the values of fundamental constants 
in any possible cognizable universe. 
The  peculiar  examples  advanced  by  Carter  exploited  of  course  many  of  the  relations  discussed  in 
1967.116 He showed for instance that if the coupling constant of the strong interactions gS
 was only a 
little weaker, there would be only hydrogen around; while if it had had a little larger value  probably we 
would  have  „stable  nuclei  of  an  almost  unlimited  size”.117  Particular  attention  was  given  to  the 
„remarkable  coincidence”  that  governs  the  subdivision  between  red  dwarfs  and  blue  giants.118  This 
-1  (rather  than  that  of  a-1)  was  and 
time,  Carter  underlined  how  critical  the  order  of  magnitude  of  aG
advanced a „potential category III explanation” of the weakness of that coupling constant. He suggested 
that119:

the  formation  of  a  planetary  system  may  be  dependent  on  the  passage  of  a  star  through  a  Hayashi  convective 
phase shortly before reaching the main sequence. Since planetary formation theory is not yet on a sound footing 
this idea is of course entirely speculative, but empirical evidence in its favour is provided by the observation that 
red dwarfs, which are still convective and middle sized stars like the sun, which left the Hayashi phase only just 
before reaching the main sequences, have much lower angular momenta than blue giants – the implication being 
that the former but not the latter lost angular momentum in forming planets. If this idea is correct, then a universe 
in which the gravitational coupling is significantly stronger than the value given by [e20 » mN] would not merely 
lack convective stars on or near the main sequence, but would in consequence have no planets and therefore no 
people. 

Speculative as it is120, this argument testifies above all the attempt to render acceptable the category III 
predictions as explanations. 

 

 

                                                 
116  In  particular  the  following  four  coincidences:  gS
2  »  2mN/mp;  Dn/me  »  2;  a  »  Dn/mp;  gS  »  (1/3)a1/2.  Barrow  and  Tipler 
(Barrow,  J.D.-Tipler,  F.J.:  The  anthropic  cosmological  …,  p.  400  and  note  48,  p.  452)  have  emphasized  in  particular  the 
relevance of the coincidence Dn/me » 2, which – once written in the form Dn - me » (cid:29)me, as in Carter’s 1967 preprint, results 
„crucial  for  the  existence  of  a  live-supporting  environment  in  the  universe”  (in  connection  with  the  productions  of  the 
adequate percentage of light elements in the early phases of the cosmological evolutionary history). Barrow and Tipler state 
here that their „belief that  Carter’s  [1967]  work  should appear in  print  provided the  original  motivation for  writing”  their 
celebrated essay. 
117  On  these  points  Cf  also  Carr,  B.J.-Rees,  M.J.:  The  anthropic  principle  ….,  p.  611  and  Barrow,  J.D.-Tipler,  F.J.:  The 
anthropic cosmological …, p. 398-400. 
118 Carter reports  here the  coincidence as e20 »  mN,  adding that it  is  „satisfied empirically  within about a factor  of ten”.  In 
front of the fact that the value of mN is around 8 X 10-20, an approximation of this kind is probably more appropriate of that 
reported in 1967. Anyway it is a frequent practice, in questions related to orders of magnitude, to make approximations in the 
range  of  two  orders  of  magnitude.  This  practice  was  for  instance  justified  by  Dirac  in  his  early  papers  on  LNH.  See  in 
particular: Dirac, P.A.M.: A new basis for cosmology, Proceedings of the Royal Society A165, 1938, p. 199-208. 
119 Cf. the analogous passage in Carter, B.: Large number coincidences…, p. 297. Note that Carter’s argument avoids here 
-1 smaller than the actual one. To the topic is dedicated just a short remark at the end 
the eventuality of having a value of aG
of  his  Princeton’s  talk.  There  Carter  suggests  that  the  problem  probably  implies  „a  specific  assumption  about  the 
fundamental state vector” in an Hilbert-space context, in order to favour “moderate rather than extreme values of the basic 
-1 „would be explained as the least extreme value compatible with the existence of 
coupling constants”. In this perspective aG
observers” producing a new kind of explanation that should be classified as category IV.

As noted by Carter in the concluding part of the 1970 talk, all depends on „one’s attitude to the world-
ensemble concept”121 or, to better say, on the acceptance of „the idea that there exist many universes, of 
which only one can be known to us”. Although „philosophically objectionable” at first sight, a similar 
conception recurred on various occasions in the 1960ies and, to be honest, also before. 
Of  course we should  now  clarify  the  meaning  of  the plural universes,  but I  can  only  hint at this very 
delicate question here. In short, if the word universe means (as it does) an all-inclusive physical whole, 
every  recourse  to  the  plural  form  should  simply  imply  a  misuse  of  language.122  In  spite  of  this  fact 
cosmologists  have  anyway  used  that  plural  since  the  very  early  days  of  relativistic  cosmology123,  not 
only with reference to different theoretical world-models but also intending causally disjointed regions 
within  a  certain  model  (as,  in  particular,  in  the  context  of  the  so  called  Eddington-Lemaitre  model,  a 
particular  type  of  the  FLRW  class  of  models124  where  expansion  is  accelerated  by  the  presence  of  a 
positive cosmological constant and „disconnected universes”125 are generated every time that „neither 
light nor any other causal influence” will be able to pass from one region to another126). 
However, if we agree on terminology we could talk properly of different universes also in the case of 
separated regions of a universe that is inhomogeneous on a very large scale as the one depicted by Idlis. 
In the 1960ies talk on many universes became relatively common when, motivated by different aims, 
various  authors  extended  their  speculations  well  beyond  the  Eddington-Lemaitre  or  any  other  of  the 
FLRW models. As an example let me recall here the attempt (due to Fred Hoyle and Jayant V. Narlikar) 
of saving the concept of global stationarity through a „radical departure” from  the original steady state 
model.127  Hoyle  and  Narlikar  postulated  that,  on  a  very  large  scale,  there  were  many  „individual 
regions” possessing different physical properties; similar scenarios were presented – almost in the same 
period – by Jaroslav Pachner and Ronald Gordon Giovanelli.128 
What matters here is that the concept of causally separated regions in a larger (if not infinite) space-
time,  found  many  different  representations  before  1970.  Carter,  on  his  part,  added  something  to  the 
Boltzmann  /Idlis  scenario;  to  wit,  the  idea  that  different  universes  may  exhibit  peculiar  values  of  the 
constants  of  nature.  He  was  not  simply  imagining  regions  of  the  universe  where  parameters  as  the 
temperature or the mean density may assume different values, but rather an ensemble of universes each 
regulated by a different physical phenomenology.

123  And  indeed  also  in  pre-relativistic  or  non  relativistic  cosmologies  as  testified  by  some  expositions  of  Charlier’s 
hierarchical cosmology (or other classical forms of the “world within worlds” scenario) or by the XIXth century speculations 
on limited universes „isolated by a dark and starless void from any other universes which may exist in the infinity of space 
beyond”. The late quotation is taken from Gore, J.E.: Studies in astronomy, Chatto and Windus, London 1904, p. 137, but 
the  idea  of  island  universes  isolated  in  a  void  devoid  of  ether  (and  then  causally  disconnected  each  other)  was  referred 
already in Filopanti, Q.: Lezioni di astronomia, L. Bortolotti, Milano 1877. 
124  The  accelerating  closed  universes  of  Eddington-Lemaitre  type  are  indeed  FLRW  universes,  although  some  scientists 
wrongly deserve that label only for universes with null cosmological constant. 
125 As they were called in Eddington, A.S.: The expansion of the universe, report of the Council to the hundred and eleventh 
annual general meeting, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 91, p. 412-416, on p. 415. Causally disjointed 
regions  in  an accelerating  universe  are  presently  under  scrutiny  again, after that  observations  of  Type  Ia supernovae  have 
seriously  suggested  the  possibility  of  a  positive  cosmological  constant.  Amongst  the  many  papers  on  this  topic  see  for

or universes. See: Gold, T.: Multiple universes, Nature 242, 1973, p. 24-25.

To say it clearly, Carter was describing a metaspace of universes whose constants were free to assume 
all possible values. We must note, anyway, that he denied as „unconventional” the temporal variation of 
the fundamental constants in any single member of the metaspace, maintaining that in each particular 
universe  the  peculiar  values  of  the  constants,  once  fixed,  was  maintained  for  the  whole  of  its 
evolutionary history. 
A  conception  of  co-existing  universes  of  this  kind129  was  presumably  derived  from  three  distinct 
sources.  Firstly, from  the  lectures  held in Cambridge  in  the early  1960ies  by  biologist  Charles  Pantin 
(that  Rees  remembers  to  have  attended  together  with  Carter130);  secondly,  from  the  „unconventional” 
scenario  of  separated  bubbles  described  by  Hoyle  and  Narlikar  around  1966131;  thirdly,  and  mainly, 
from  the  relative  state  formulation  of  quantum  mechanics  due  to  Hugh  Everett  which  became  called 
many worlds interpretation after de Witt contributions.132 
It is in fact the de Witt-Wheeler interpretation of Everett’s proposal, with its description of a universe133 
possessing „many branches, only one of which can be known to any well defined individual observer, 
but  all  of  which  are  equally  real”,  that  Carter  invoked  in  his  1970  paper  in  association  with  the 
„statistical ensemble” requested by Category III explanations. 
„Everett philosophy” – as Carter baptised it – not only appeared as „the only interpretation of quantum 
theory … which makes sense in cosmological contexts”, but also as the appropriate and natural tool for 
considering  some  of  the  coupling  constants  as  particular  operators  in  the  Hilbert-space  of  a  world-
ensemble. 

 

 

 
7. THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE(S) 

                                                 
129 The expression co-existing universes is mediated from a classification due to George Gale (see: Gale, G.: Cosmological 
fecundity  …).  He  distinguished  three  classes  of  many  universes  scenarios:  „spatially  multiple  universes”,  „temporally 
multiple  universes”  and  „other-dimensional  multiple  universes”.  The  third  class  is  defined  as  those  universes  which  exist 
simultaneously as single spatiotemporal entities in some sort of metaspace (Gale does not say this clearly, but it is implicit in 
his exposition which is centred on the concept of possibility). Ambiguous as it is, Gale’s classification is at bottom nothing 
more  that  the  re-elaboration  of  the  Medieval  distinction  among  the  innumerable  speculations  on  many  worlds  which 
followed  Etienne  Temper’s  decree  of  1277.  On  this  last  point  cf.  in  particular  Duhem,  P.M.M.:  Medieval  cosmology: 
theories of infinity, place, time, void, and the plurality of worlds, Chicago 1986. 
130 Rees, M.J.: Before the beginning …, p. 259. Pantin suggested in particular that „if we could know that our own Universe 
was only one of an indefinite number with varying properties we could perhaps invoke a solution analogous to the principle 
of  Natural  Selection;  that  only  in  certain  universes,  which  happen  to  include  ours,  are  the  conditions  suitable  for  the 
existence of life, and unless that condition is fulfilled there will be no observers to note the fact." Cf Pantin, C.F.A.: Life and 
the conditions of existence, in: Biology and Personality, Ramsey, I.T. (ed.), Oxford 1965, p. 83-106, on p. 103-104. 
131  Carter  alluded  to  a  peculiar  aspect  of  Hoyle  and  Narlikar  work  in  Carter,  B.:  The  complete  analytic  extension  of  the 
Reissner-Nordström metric in the special case e2 = m2, Physics Letters 21, 1966, p. 423-424. He didn’t show, anyway, any 
clear sign of being interested at all in their new cosmological ideas. 
132 I will spend just few words on Everett’s relative state formulation of quantum mechanics here. In his original papers of 
the late 1950ies the author presented a conception in which measurement didn’t collapse the wave function to a single value. 
Everett didn’t write a lot on the topic and, apart from the purpose of saving a realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, it 
remains largely unclear how this theory should work in order to give determinate measurements results. 
During the 1960ies, however, Everett’s  formulation was  associated with a many-worlds  interpretation. This was  primarily 
due to the reading of Everett by Wheeler and Bryce de Witt. The latter, in particular, suggested explicitly that the world was 
splitting in many alternative real branches as a result of quantum measurements. 
De  Witt  published  his  views  at  last  on  the  pages  of  the  September  1970  issue  of  Physics  Today  (provoking  an  extended 
debate, which was covered in the April 2001 issue of that journal) and then practically canonized them in an anthology of 
papers  on Everett’s proposal  – edited  jointly  with Graham  – that  was called  The Many-Worlds Interpretation of  Quantum 
Mechanics, a name that was there to stay. 
The MWI was destined to become a proposal seen with suspicion by almost everyone with the exception of cosmologists, 
which  found  in  it  the  only  way  to  connect  the  concept  of  a  wave  function  of  the  whole  universe  with  the  embarrassing 
eventuality to conceive an observer external to the universe itself. 
133 Or to better say: of „the state vector of the universe”

Five/six years after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background the hot big bang model was on 
the verge to become standard and to enter in textbooks as a paradigm.134 The consecration of the model, 
which consisted essentially in the physical description of the evolution of the early expanding universe 
from  10-2  seconds  after  the  big  bang  to  the  decoupling  at  the  end  of  the  radiation  era,  was  in  fact 
canonized early in the 1970ies in a long series of books and papers.135 
Clearly  the  model  was  not  (and  still  is  not)  a  complete  theory.  Just  to  give  some  examples,  the 
formation of cosmic structures, the peculiar features of the hadronic era or of those which preceded it, 
or  the  initial  singularity  itself  all  remained  problems  unsolved  in  the  context  of  the  model  itself  and 
waiting for further physical advancements. 
In  effect  is  hard  to  say  today  what  Carter  exactly  meant  with  conventional  or  orthodox  physics.  If 
orthodox stands for accepted knowledge in a certain moment, we must not forget that many aspects of 
the soon-to-come standard model of elementary particle physics were still part of a work in progress in 
the early  1970ies.  At the same  time,  the emerging  paradigm  produced new enigmas, among them  the 
first discussions of the so called flatness and horizon problems.136 
These problems contributed to transform the fears of an oversimplification of FLRW cosmologies that 
pestered  the  researchers  of  the  1930ies  into  a  series  of  interrogatives  on  the  peculiar  features  of  the 
actual  universe.  In  particular,  the  isotropy  of  the  microwave  background  became  a  fact  in  need  of  a 
coherent explanation rather than an ideal (and presumably oversimplified) assumption. 
In  the  second  part  of  the  1960ies  cosmologists  began  to  follow  two  main  schools:  some  invoked  a 
mechanism  capable  to  smooth  the  universe  content  in  the  very  early  evolutionary  phases137;  while 
others  took  the  observed  situation  at  its  face-value  posing  questions  on  the  peculiarity  of  initial 
conditions. 
The Dicke/Carter philosophy, as it was soon called138, found a collocation in this second school when it 
was used by Collins and Hawking to establish how peculiar were the initial conditions that generate the 
observed spatially isotropic universe with respect to the set of initial conditions of all possible spatially 
homogeneous  universes  that  emerge  as  solutions  of  Einstein’s  field  equations  (with  a  minimum  of 
physical assumptions on the energy contents). 
In their paper of 1973 the two English physicists regarded indeed Carter’s ideas on a very large number 
of  universes  as  the  „most  attractive  answer”139  to  the  puzzling  situation  that  our  highly  isotropic 

                                                 
134 Take care of the fact that almost everything cosmologists use the term paradigm in a sense very different from Kuhn. In 
fact,  they  generally  mean  with  “paradigm”  a  network  of  new  ideas  or  theoretical  options  which  integrate  (rather  than 
substitute through a “scientific revolution” in Kuhn’s sense) the preceding ones. Moreover, sometimes cosmologists use the 
term “paradigm” (instead of “model”) to mean a theoretical structure which is not  yet completely formalised and which is 
consequently still open to personal beliefs. To check some examples cf. Ellis, G.F.R.: Innovation, resistance and change: the 
transition to  the  expanding  universe, in:  Modern  cosmology in retrospect,  Bertotti, B.-Balbinot,  R.-Bergia,  S.-Messina, A.

universe  was  of  „measure  zero  in  the  space  of  all  homogeneous  models”.140  Consequently  they 
concluded141: 
 
From  the  existence  of  the  unstable  anisotropic  mode  it  follows  that  nearly  all  of  the  universes  become  highly 
anisotropic. However these universes would not be expected to contain galaxies, since condensations can grow 
only in universes in which the rate of expansion is just sufficient to avoid recollapse. The existence of galaxies 
would seem to be a necessary precondition for the development of any form of intelligent life. Thus there will be 
life  only  in  those  universes  which  tend  toward  isotropy  at  large  times.  The  fact  that  we  have  observed  the 
universe to be isotropic is therefore only a consequence of our own existence. 

The  Collins/Hawking  paper  was  not  the  only  one  that  invoked  Carter’s  line  of  thought  before  it  first 
appeared  in  a  publication  in  1974.  Freeman  Dyson  (who  was  probably  the  first  to  appeal  in  1972  at 
something  as  Carter's  principle  of  cognizability  on  print)  esteemed  Carter’s  „speculative  arguments” 
and his extension of Dicke’s ideas142; Martin Rees expounded Carter ideas and terminology on a couple 
of occasions, arguing amongst other things that Dicke’s coincidence had to be „automatically satisfied” 
in  any  cognizable  universe.143  Also  Tryon  was  presumably  influenced  by  Carter’s  ideas  (although  he 
didn’t quote him) in introducing a „principle of biological selection, which states that any universe in 
which sentient beings find themselves is necessarily hospitable to sentient beings" in his paper on the 
creation of the universe out of nothing.144 
A  strong  support  for  Carter’s  perspectives  then  came  from  John  Archibald  Wheeler,  who  linked  the 
world-ensemble concept with his cyclical model, where new closed universes with different values of 
various  fundamental  parameters  emerged  after  the  Big  Crunch  of  a  previous  universe.145  Already  in 
December  1967,  when  discussing  the  concept  of  superspace,  Wheeler  contemplated  the  „thought-
provoking” ideas of his Princeton colleague Dicke, when addressing the question as to „why then do we 
happen  to  be  living  in  that  part  of  superspace  where  we  find  ourselves?”.146  In  the  early  1970ies  he 
quoted  several  times  the  Dicke/Carter’s  philosophy  and  Carter's  still  unpublished  arguments.147  In 
particular, at the symposium on the development of the physicist's conception of nature held in Trieste 
on September 1972, Wheeler had the following verbal exchange with Dirac148: 

                                                 
140 Ibid., p. 333. The assumption of a young universe implies an alternative to the conclusion according to which it is of zero 
measure in the considered metaspace. This eventuality has been studied by Barrow in different occasions. E.g.: Barrow, J.D.: 
The  isotropy  of  the  universe,  Quarterly  Journal  of  the  Royal  Astronomical  Society  23,  1982,  p.  344-357;    Barrow,  J.D.-

anthropic cosmological …, section 6.11.(cid:4) 
141 Ibid., p. 319. A statement often quoted from the Collins and Hawking’s paper was: „the answer to the question "why is 
the universe isotropic?" is "because we are here" “ (cf p. 334).

In  the  end  Wheeler  asked  Carter  „to  say  something  for  the  record”  on  his  ideas.  In  other  words:  to 
publish  something  on  a  subject  by  now  widely  discussed  in  the  community  of  astrophysicists  and 
cosmologists but that is author, even considering it „potentially fertile”, still believed in need of „further 
development”.149 

       The opportunity arrived in occasion of the 63th symposium of the IAU, held in Cracow from 10th to 12th 
September  1973.  That  meeting,  dedicated  to  the  Confrontation  of  Cosmological  Theories  with 
Observation, coincided with  the  celebrations  of the  500th  anniversary  of Copernicus’  birth and  Carter 
spoke  in  the  section  devoted  to  the  structure  of  singularities.  Before  Carter’s  talk,  Hawking  repeated 
that the „only explanation” of the isotropy of the universe was that founded on the suggestions of Dicke 
and  Carter  himself150,  while  Wheeler  (chairman  on  that  day)  pointed  out  that  Hawking,  Dicke  „and 
Carter have touched such an interesting topic as the question whether man is involved in the design of 
the universe in a much more central way that one can previously imagine”.151 
It was indeed in some sense paradoxical that, in front of an audience gathered to address „tribute to the 
creator of the first scientific cosmological theory”152, Carter remarked immediately that his intervention 
consisted:  „basically  of  a  reaction  against  exaggerated  subservience  to  the  Copernican  principle”.153 
Following Bondi, he intended here that criterion according to which we avoid to consider the Earth in a 
„central, specially favoured position”154; a criterion that, „unfortunately”, has been sometime extended 
in a dogmatic manner. 
Carter had in mind all those assumptions which invoke an extension of the usual cosmological principle 
to time in spite of Dicke’s arguments and, in particular, that perfect cosmological principle which was 
assumed as a dogma in developing the steady-state model.155 He underlined that the universe „is by no 
means  homogeneous  on  a  local  scale”  (say  <  100  Mpc),  aiming  at  last  to  pronounce  (as  he  later 
wrote)156: 
 
a warning to astrophysical and cosmological theorists of the risk of error in the interpretation of astronomical and 
cosmological information unless due account is taken of the biological restraints under which the information was 
acquired. 

 

 

In  other  words,  in  1973  Carter  cautioned  his  audience  to  avoid  the  error  of  extending  improperly  any 
homology  or  uniformity assumption. One thing  was  to  state that  the  Earth  is  not  in a central position, 
another  one  was  to  conduct (consciously  or  subconsciously)157  this  statement  to  the  extreme  opposite, 
concluding that our position in space/time is absolutely typical and has nothing of peculiar or privileged. 

                                                                                                                                                                       
As  seen,  the  idea  of  a  cyclical  succession  of  many  (possibly:  infinitely  many)  closed  universes,  with  reprocessing  of  the 
values of the fundamental constants and particle masses at the beginning of any new cycle, was anyway Wheeler’s and not 
Carter’s stuff.

gravitational coupling …) postulates that our location in spacetime is entirely random a priori.”

157 In 1973 Carter suggested that the tendency to extend the Copernican principle „to a most questionable dogma to the effect 
that  our  situation  cannot  be  privileged  in  any  sense”  was  „not  always  subconscious”  (Carter,  B.:  Large  number 

 

 

25 

The  awareness  that  an  abuse  of  the  hypothesis  of  homology  could  be  a  source  of  bias,  led  Carter  to 
formulate a methodological principle in order to avoid the formulation of cosmological principles based 
on an improper extrapolation of apparent symmetries. 
The  moral  of  all  this  in  the  case  of  the  large  adimensional  numbers  was  that  it  is  not  necessary  to 
elaborate unconventional extensions of physics and cosmology to explain the coincidences among them.  
In 1973, Carter re-named then the three categories of 1970 in accordance with what he now called the 
anthropic principle. 
Category I coincidences were said to be of a „traditional kind", while category II coincidences became 
those which require the weak anthropic principle (WAP), i.e. a precept according to which158: 
 
we must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is necessarily privileged to the 
extent of being compatible with our existence as observers. 
 
„More questionable" as they were159, category III coincidences were said to require something more to 
be accepted as „complete physical explanations".160 I.e.: 
either an extension of the theory itself 
- 
- 
or a new philosophy which makes possible to realize a combination of the ordinary WAP with 
an hypothesis on the existence of an ensemble of connected or disconnected branches of the universe 
over which „fundamental constants would have an extended range of values".161 

The  strong  anthropic  principle  (SAP)  was  indeed  a  statement  deriving  from  the  „world  ensemble 
philosophy”162 and according to which163 
 
the universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of 
observers within it at some stage. 
 
On this basis, Carter contemplated the eventuality of a systematical exploration of the constraints on the 
value of fundamental parameters that, at least in principle derive from the existence of living observers. 
He admitted that SAP was not a „completely satisfying" criterion and that research for solutions based 
on  a  deeper  „mathematical  structure"  was  still  preferable.  At  the  same  time,  at  least  choosing  such  a 
suggestive terminology re-calling the anthropos, he surely advanced a proposal (if not, consciously or 
subconsciously, a provocation) destined to fuel interminable debates. 
Some  authors  in  fact  soon  read  teleological  (if  not  theological)  implications  in  SAP,  substituting  (or 
sometime associating) a taylor-made universe for the many-universes philosophy.164 

                                                                                                                                                                       
coincidences…, p. 291). In 1983 he wrote that the „extreme antithesis of the anthropocentric outlook was most dangerous as 
a source of biased thinking when it was adopted subconsciously” (Carter, B.: The anthropic principle and its implications …, 
p. 347).

162 Carter, B.: Large number coincidences…, p. 298 
163 Ibid., p. 294. Immediately after this statement Carter inserted the famous passage: „To paraphrase Descartes, cogito ergo 
mundus talis est”. 
164 Early teleological readings were advanced mainly after Wheeler's papers quoted in n. 56 & 131. With his ideas about a 
relevance of life and mind on the structure of the universe, Wheeler was surely influential on that part (not large, but indeed 
eminent)  of  the  physics  community  that  was  involved  with  the  anthropic  reasoning.  Apart  from  the  already  mentioned 
contributions,  one  may  see  also  Wheeler's  interview  published  on  Cosmic  Search  4,  1979  (nowadays  available  on 
www.bigear.org/vol1no4/wheeler.htm),  where  the  author  resumed  Dicke's  argument  into  the  question  „what  good  is  a 
universe without somebody around to look at it?" and stated that „the anthropic principle looks at this universe, that universe 
and the other universe and rules out as mere meaningless machines all those in which awareness does not develop at some 
time". 
Other sources that favoured a teleological reading of Carter's principle(s) were: Trimble, V.: Cosmology : Man’s place in the 
universe, American Scientist 65, 1977, p. 77-86 ; Eccles, J.: The human mystery, New York 1979; Dyson, F.J.: Disturbing 
the universe, New York 1979 (A paper as Wald, G.: Fitness in the universe: choices and necessities, Origins of Life 5, 1974, 

 

26 

In  effect,  Carter’s  terminological  choice  recalled  teleological  overtones  in  more  than  a  sense.  For 
instance, just think to the fact that the term anthropic was coined by the Anglican theologian Frederick 
Robert Tennant who –at the end of the third decade of the XX century- aimed to a „wider teleology” in 
his Philosophical Theology.165 
It is not my aim anyway to enquiry here the debate on the anthropic reasoning developed after Carter, 
or to discuss the anthropic principle(s) from an epistemological point of view.166 I will limit myself to 
say  that,  during  the  1980ies,  Carter  himself  advanced  an  epistemological  defence  of  his  anthropic 
principle.167  In  a  couple  of  occasions  he  then  invoked  a  Bayesian  approach  to  probability  and  stated 
again  that  scientists  should  be  cautious  on  extending  homology  or  symmetry  assumptions.  At  last, 
Carter elaborated the following general statement:  
 
Whenever one wishes to draw general conclusions from observations restricted to a small sample it is essential to 
know  whether  the  sample  should  be  considered  to  be  biased,  and  if  so  how.  The  anthropic  principle  provides 
guidelines for taking account of the kind of bias that arises from the observer’s  own particular situation in the 
world.168 
 
This statement confirms what the author affirmed clearly during the discussion that followed his talk at 
the  Venice  conference  of  1988;  i.e.,  that  he  presently  regards  the  anthropic  principle  as  a  general 
principle of scientific enterprise rather than a cosmological one. 
The 1980ies anyway brought with them also big developments in cosmology and fundamental physics. 
These  induced  theoretical  physicists  to  accept  the  idea  that  certain  features  in  the  structure  of  the 
observable universe (e.g.: its size, its average density, the photon-to-baryon ratio) are particular exits of 
peculiar  initial  conditions,  due  to  symmetry  breaking  phase  transitions  or  to  pseudo-casual  processes 
that  happened  in  the  very  early  evolutionary  history  of  the  universe.169  As  a  consequence,  scenarios 
                                                                                                                                                                       
p. 7-27, with all its references to a natural selection in the universe and  to Henderson’s Fitness of the environment, could 
appear as an important contribution in retrospect. Anyway it doesn't quote the anthropic principle). 
The resurgence in teleological views in connection with the anthropic principle(s) reached a peak with the publication of the 
Barrow-Tipler  essay  (which  is  opened  by  a  preface  by  Wheeler).  The  two  authors  advocated  indeed  an  eutaxiological 
perspective (i.e.: aimed to point at the presence of a mathematical order and a „co-present, harmonius composition” of things 
in nature) rather than a teleological one. They outlined however a line of continuity between contemporary cosmology and a 
long series of philosophical speculations on the Design argument, and were surely responsible for large part of the common 
matching between anthropic reasoning and teleology. 
To evaluate the impact of the teleological insights of Barrow-Tipler's essay, one may consult the following critical reviews:

168 This passage is taken by the draft of an article on the anthropic principle sent by Carter to Richard Matzner. 
169 While in the early 1980ies there were no compelling reasons to invoke seriously the concept of many universes in the 
form of disconnected domains, in the successive years that same concept was seen under a new light after a big change due 

 

27 

describing  a  multitude  of  causally  disconnected  branches  of  space/time  called  bubbles,  domains  or 
simply universes became customary in inflationary and quantum cosmology. 
In recent times, moreover, while Carter has changed his mind with respect to both SAP and the many-
worlds  philosophy170,  a  plethora  of  anthropic  principles  have  been  invoked  in  technical  contexts  and 
philosophical debates. 
It seems that, although we surely have today a deeper understanding of various  unsolved problems of 
the standard theory in comparison with the 1970ies, the advancement of knowledge has not made the 
need  for  anthropic  reasoning  obsolete.  The  emergence  of  many  contemporary  cosmological  scenarios 
seems instead to have simply shifted anthropic explanations at a more profound theoretical level. 
In conclusion I am then ready to affirm as a matter of fact that, although physicists have surely  gone 
deeper  in  a  series  of  issues  since  1973,  this  does  not  seem to  have  eliminated at all  the  appeal  to the 
anthropic reasoning.171 
 

                                                                                                                                                                       
to  the  failure  of  early  inflationary  models,  to  new  developments  in  fundamental  physics  and  to  the  emergence  (or 
persistence) of problems like those represented by the current value of the cosmological constant, the level of isotropy of the 
cosmic microwave background and the origin of cosmic structures. The cosmologists of the 1990ies moreover accepted the 
presence  of a "random element in the initial evolutionary  history of the universe" (Barrow, J.D.: Unprincipled cosmology, 
Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society 34, 1993, p. 117-134, on p. 131) as a consequence of developments in 
fundamental physics. 
During  the  1980ies  and  the  1990ies,  theories  as  Linde  proposals  (chaotic  or  eternal  inflation)  invoked  then  disconnected 
domains in the universe as a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in  very early phases and depicted at last the 
concept  itself  of  a  primeval  explosion  as  a  local  event  and  our  universe  as  a  particular  space/time  domain  of  a  globally 
stationary multiverse. All this contributed to make many universes scenarios a common occurrence. 
170  Cf.  Carter,  B.:  The  anthropic  selection  principle  …,  p.  36.  At  the  Venice  conference  of  1988  Carter  confessed  to  find 
antiquated his old perspective on both SAP and the many worlds philosophy. He affirmed this explicitly in the (unpublished) 
discussion that followed Sciama’s talk (which was indeed dedicated to the many universes). Anyway, Carter’s new attitude 
emerged  in  Venice  also  from  his  own  talk  and  from  the  discussion  of  Ellis,  G.F.R.:  The  anthropic  principle:  laws  and 
environments (in: Bertola, U.-Curi, V. (eds.): The Anthropic principle, …, p. 27-36). He said: „it should be borne in mind 
that  if  the  fine  structure  constant  had  been  different  one  may  guess  that  nature  would  have  found  alternative  but  not 
necessarily  less  effective  mechanisms  for  doing  the  same  jobs,  so  the  argument  for  the  strong  anthropic  principle  (better 
described as the strong anthropic proposal) is not as strong as might at first appear”. 
171 Among all the recent applications of the anthropic reasoning, I want to remember here just one example: Tegmark and 
Rees attempt to justify anthropically the value of the adimensional number Q ” DT/T, which express the observed density 
fluctuations  of  the  microwave  background.  See:  Tegmark,  M.-Rees,  M.J.:  Why  is  the  cosmic  microwave  background 
fluctuation level 10-5?, Astrophysical Journal 499, 1998, p. 526-532.(cid:2)

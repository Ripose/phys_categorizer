Abstract.  It  is  shown  that  the  force  in  relativistic  mechanics  is  not  only  the  cause  of 
acceleration of particle relative to an inertial frame of reference, but also the cause of change of 
the  course  of  time  along  the  particle’s  trajectory.  Therein  lies  the  physical  content  of  the 
dynamical  principle  underlying  the  special  theory  of  relativity  (relativistic  mechanics).  The 
general  formula  for  the  relative  course  of  time  between  the  points  lying  on  the  trajectory  of 
motion of particle under the action of a force field in an inertial reference frame is derived. The 
applications  of  the  theory  developed  to  homogeneous  fields  -  to  the  field  of  gravity  and 
electromagnetic field, and also to the gravitational field produced by a point mass particle are 
considered. Physical properties of the state of imponderability of particle in an external force 
field are investigated. It is noted that the change in the course of time in a force field is in 
no way connected with the change in space-time metric and is a direct consequence of 
the causality principle of relativistic mechanics. 

1.  Introduction 

 

 

 

Time is among the most common concepts, which are used constantly both in everyday life 
and in science. This is because all the events and material processes in the world happen in space 
and develop in time and, hence, the laws that govern space-time connections are the most general 
and  hold  for  all  the  forms  of  matter.  Nevertheless,  time  remains  one  of  the  most  mysterious 
concepts of physics; its physical essence is not adequately revealed up till now [1-4]. The concept 
of time with difficulty yields to logical analysis. 

From the point of view of common sense the essence of time is that time characterizes the 
duration of events and processes, indicates their natural sequence, at which the present, going away 
to the past, gives place to the future.  

I.  Newton  gave  a  clear-cut  characteristic  of  the  concept  of  time,  to  which  the  majority  of 
physicists adheres: ”The absolute, true, and mathematical time in itself and by virtue of its nature 
flows  uniformly  and  regardless  to  any  other  object”.  Though,  according  to  Newton,  time  flows 
equally  and  uniformly  and  does  not  depend  on  the  processes,  occurring  in  the  world,  the  daily 
experience  speaks  in  favour  of  the  fact  that  the  course  of  time  is  not  uniform.  Depending  on 
circumstances  in  our  history,  it  seems  to  us  that  time  either  flies  swiftly  or  hangs  heavy  on  our 
hands;  sometimes  it  even  changes  suddenly,  by  leaps.  In  connection  with  these  speculations  the 
question arises of whether the subjective sensations of non-uniformity in the course of time familiar 
to everyone have an objective basis. 

In Newtonian mechanics time is of an absolute character, it does not change as one passes 
from one inertial reference frame to another and represents merely a parameter, whose change at the 
will  of  explorer  results  in  the  change  of  state  of  a  mechanical  system  in  accordance  with  the 
equation of motion. 

In  relativistic  mechanics  time  remains  a  parameter  describing  the  development  of  system. 
But  now  time  and  space  are  intimately  linked  with  each  other  to  form  a  single  whole  –  the  4- 
dimensional  space-time.  In  going  from  one  inertial  frame  of  reference  to  another  time  gets 
entangled  with  spatial  coordinates,  so  that  time  in  one  reference  frame  represents  a  ”mixture”  of 
time  and  coordinates  in  the  other.  Time  ceases  to  be  universal,  the  same  in  all  inertial  reference 
frames; it takes on a relative character.

The indissoluble association of time and space takes on special importance in the light of the 
concept  of  physical  field,  which  was  called  by  Einstein  the  most  important  discovery  in  physics 
after the times of Newton. According to this concept, the occurrence in space of a force field means 
that space turns into a physical environment, which is capable to interact directly with other bodies 
and gains, thus, physical properties, becoming an active participant of physical processes. In view 
of the fact that space and time are indissolubly related to each other, the presence of a force field in 
some area of space must necessarily result in the appearance of physical properties of time caused 
by the motion of body in this area. 

Thus,  from  the  synthesis  of  the  notion  of  space-time  and  of  the  idea  of  physical  field  it 
follows with necessity that the course of time in a given region of space should depend on physical 
processes in this region, i.e. time, as well as space, should have physical properties [5-8].  

It should be emphasized that in special theory of relativity (STR) time and spatial coordinates 
are independent and formally equal in rights quantities, which determine the position of elementary 
events  in  space-time.  On  the  other  hand,  time  stands  out  in  relation  to  spatial  coordinates.  The 
special role of time is due, from the viewpoint of geometry, to the pseudoeuclidity of geometry of 
the  4-dimensional  space.  From  the  physical  point  of  view,  it  is  associated  with  the  dynamical 
principle  (causality  principle),  according  to  which  the  state  of  motion  of  a  physical  system  at  an 
instant of time t  uniquely defines its behaviour at the next instant of time 
. The significance of 
dynamical principle lies in  the fact that  it relates the temporal evolution of system to the physical 
processes caused by force fields and in doing so it allows one to determine the course of time in the 
system, its possible dependence upon the character of physical processes, and not just the sequence 
of events and their duration.

The idea about  the existence of the physical  properties  of time belongs to N. Kozyrev [9]. 
By  introducing  into  mechanics  an  additional  parameter  taking  into  account  the  directivity  of  the 
course of time, Kozyrev has formulated causal (asymmetrical) mechanics from which it follows that 
time has physical properties. According to the results of theoretical and experimental investigations 
conducted by Kozyrev and his followers [9-13], events can proceed not only in time, but also with 
the help of time, information being transmitted not through force fields, but via a temporal channel, 
and  the  transfer  of  information  happens  instantaneously.  The  appearance  of  additional  forces, 
associated  with  the  physical  properties  of  time  and  capable  to  fulfill  work,  testifies  that  time  can 
serve as a power source.  

In  the  papers  by  I.  Eganova  [12]  and  M.  Lavrent'ev  and  I.  Eganova  [13]  the  problem  is 
stated  of  direct  experimental  research  of  the  physical  properties  of  time  with  the  purpose  to 
ascertain the relations of a new type between phenomena and to discover new methods of changing 
the state of substance. In [14] O. Jefimenko investigated the dynamical effect of the slowing-down 
of time. 

According to [6-8], the conclusion that physical properties of time exist follows strictly from 
relativistic  mechanics,  without  introducing  any  additional  hypotheses.  The  physical  properties  of 
time  are  of  purely  dynamical  nature:  their  existence  results  from  dynamical  principle.  The 
availability of physical properties of time is manifested in that time has a local inhomogeneity: its 
course along the trajectory of motion of a point particle in a force field is continuously changed, and 
this  change  in  the  course  of  time  is  a  result  of  the  action  upon  the  particle  of  a  force field in the 
inertial reference frame, in which the motion is considered.  

In view of fundamental importance of the problem considered, we shall discuss the physical 

content of the local dynamical inhomogeneity of time in more detail. 
Let us consider the motion of a classical point particle under the action of a force field in the 
 
inertial  reference  frames  K   and  K ′ ,  moving  relative  to  each  other.  The  Cartesian  coordinates 
connected with the reference frames are assumed for definiteness to be oriented in such a manner 
-axes of the frame  K ′ , the  x -axis 
that the 
and  the  x′ -axis  coincide  with  each  other,  and  the  reference  frame  K ′   moves  with  a  velocity 
0V

relative to the  K -frame along the  x -axis. Denote by

seen from (1), if during some interval of time the  x -component of velocity of a particle is changed 

(

change in the velocity of particle in an inertial reference frame is conditioned, according to the main 
postulate of classical mechanics, by the action on particle of a force connected with some physical 
field,  hence,  the  force  acting  on  particle  is  the  reason  of  change  in  the  course  of  time  along  the 
particle’s trajectory.

According to (1), the  gist of the phenomenon of local dynamical inhomogeneity of time is

the  point  A .  As  the  change  in  the  particle’s  velocity  is  determined  by  the  force  influence  on  the 
particle, it follows from here that the force acting on a particle in some inertial reference frame is 
the reason for change in the course of time along the particle’s trajectory. In other words, the 
dynamical inhomogeneity of time means that the different instants of time on the time axis prove to 
be physically non-equivalent when the particle moves in a force field.

the particle’s velocities at points  A  and  B  are not identical in magnitude. In this case, if 
, 
,  i.e.  to  equal  distances,  which  the  particle  passes  in  different 
then,  generally  speaking, 
regions of space in reference frame K ′ , there correspond different distances traversed by the particle 
in  reference  frame K .  This  can  be  caused by both the different course  of time at points A  and  B  
and the different velocities of  particle  at  these  points.  In this connection the questions arise: How 
can these factors be separated from each other? How can the relative course of time be determined 
between the different points of space being considered in the same inertial reference frame? 
 
Relying on the reasoning given above, it is natural to suppose that the change in the course 
of  time  at  the  points  lying on the  particle’s  trajectory can be caused only  by the  action of a force 
field on the particle. Indeed, in the absence of force field, when the particle moves by inertia, there 
are no reasons for changing the course of time. Let's go over from the inertial reference frame K , in 
which  the  motion  of  a  particle  takes  place  under  the  action  of  a  force  field,  to  such  a  noninertial 
~′ ,  in  which  the  inertial  force  is  completely  compensated  for  by  the  force  field 
reference  frame  K
~′ -frame the particle 
action at that point of space where the particle is at rest. Apparently, in the  K
moves by inertia, i.e. it is in a free state (imponderability state) [15,16]. Since in this state the force 
effect on the particle is absent and, thus, the reason of changing the course of time is lacking, in this 
reference frame the course of time should be uniform at the point where the particle is placed. By 
~′ -frame at the point where the particle is placed two equal in magnitude intervals 
choosing in the K
of  time  corresponding  to  two  different  points A   and  B   lying  on  the  particle’s  trajectory  in  the 
inertial reference frame K , and by performing then the inverse transition from the reference frame 
~′  to the  K -frame, we may define the magnitude of relative course of time between points  A  and 
K
B  in the reference frame K . 
In this paper, on the basis of the reasoning above, the relative course of time is considered 
 
between the points  lying  on  particle’s  trajectory  in  an  inertial reference frame in uniform external 
field, and also in gravitational field created by a material point. 
Note  that  equality  (1)  is  one  of  the  relationships  entering  into  the  Lorentz  transformations 
 
for  coordinates  and  time,  and  consequently  it  is  not  new.  A  new  point  is  that  an  analysis  of  this 
relationship, as applied to the motion of point particle in a path under the action of a force field, is 
given and on its basis a number of physical consequences is derived concerning the course of time, 
which were not discussed in literature till now and were formulated for the first time in [5-8]. These 
consequences are important not only for elucidating the physical nature of time, but also for a deep 
insight  into  the  physical  content  of  relativistic  mechanics,  and  thus  they  deserve  consideration  in 
more detail. 
 
According to A. Logunov, the main content of special theory of relativity (STR) consists in 
that  "all  physical  processes  proceed  in  space-time  possessing  pseudoeuclidean  geometry"  ([4], 
p.26). Undeniably, from the mathematical (geometrical) point of view, in the formulation presented 
above  the  essence  of  STR  is  expressed  correctly,  still  the  physical  content  of  relativistic 
mechanics,  the  physical  essence  of  dynamical principle underlying it, is that  the force is not 
only the reason of particle’s acceleration in an inertial reference frame, but also the reason of 
the  change  in  the  course  of  time  along  particle’s  trajectory.  It  should  be  emphasized  that 
existence  of  a  link  between  the  force  and  the  course  of  time  along  particle’s  trajectory  follows 
directly  from  the  fact  that  space  and  time  are  connected  with  each  other  to  form  a  single  4-
dimensional space. 
Thus, the fundamental difference between relativistic mechanics and Newtonian one lies not 
 
only in the fact that in Newtonian mechanics time is of an absolute character and does not change in 
going over from one inertial frame of reference to another, and in STR it ceases to be identical in all 
inertial reference frames. In relativistic mechanics time with necessity acquires physical properties, 
which  are  conditioned  by  the  action  on  particle  of  a  force  connected  with  a  physical  field.  As  a 
result of the force action, the course of time is continuously changed along the particle’s trajectory. 

In  connection  with  the  phenomenon  of  dynamical  inhomogeneity  of  time,  let  us  consider 

equality

with  dx  and  xd ′  being the increments of coordinates in the reference frames  K  and  K ′ . It would 
seem,  equality  (3)  points  to  the  existence  of  the  dynamical  inhomogeneity  of  spatial  coordinates 
similar to the time inhomogeneity. Indeed, according to (3) the distance  dx , traveled by a particle in 
the  K -frame, depends not only on the distance  xd ′ , which the particle passes in the K ′ -frame, but 
also on the instant of time  t′ . This dependence cannot be treated, however, as a manifestation of the 
dynamical inhomogeneity of spatial coordinates. Formula (3) is a trivial consequence of kinematics: 
it expresses the simple fact that the distance traveled by particle depends on its velocity, which may 
change with time (as a result of the action of force). Really, in classical mechanics, on the basis of 
Galileo transformations, we have successively:

From  here,  using  the  velocity  addition  law  and  Lorentz  transformations  for  time,  we  arrive  at 
formula (3). 

Thus,  as  distinct  from  spatial  coordinates,  time  in  relativistic  mechanics  may  be  deformed 
(i.e. time scale may change) under the action of an external force. It should be emphasized that the 
active role of time in dynamics is due to the dynamical principle: the latter is formulated in terms of 
time, not of spatial coordinates. 

Let us enumerate the main results presented in the subsequent sections of the paper. 
 
In  section  2  a  general  formula  is  given  for  the  relative  course  of  time  between  the  points 
lying on particle’s trajectory in a force field in an inertial reference frame. It is demonstrated that a 
consistency condition is fulfilled for the theory of the change of the course of time in a force field 
developed in the paper. 
 
The  application  of general theory to homogeneous fields - to electric field  and the field of 
gravity  is  considered  in  section  3.  It  is  noted  here  that,  because  of  relativistic  corrections  to  the 
equation  of  motion  of  particle,  the  homogeneous  field  cannot  be  compensated  for  completely  by 
inertial  forces.  The  imponderability  state  of  relativistic  particle  in  homogeneous  field  possesses 
stability:  if  we  remove  the  particle  from  the  state  of  imponderability  with  the  help  of  an  external 
force and then leave it to its own devices, the particle returns to the imponderability state. 
Section 4 is devoted to the investigation of the course of time and imponderability state in 
 
homogeneous  electromagnetic  field.  The  formula  is  deduced  for  the  relative  course  of  time  along 
particle’s 
in  nonrelativistic 
approximation. 
In  section 5 the application of general theory is considered to the motion of particle in the 
 
gravitational field created by mass point. The quasiinertial reference frames freely falling on a force 
center in different radial directions are noted to be physically nonequivalent to each other.

space, remains free at any other point (i.e. the force effect on particle is lacking in the whole space:

To circumstantiate, in what sense and with what accuracy the  K

we shall represent the external force, acting on the particle, as a sum of two components: the force

deflecting  the  particle  from  the  state  of  imponderability.  By  transforming  the  equation  of  motion

Consequently, in describing the motion of particle in the region  P  the reference frame  K
considered as inertial one. Apparently, the region  P  lies in a vicinity of the point, at which   
 
and  the  accuracy,  with  which  the  frame K
inequality (13) is fulfilled. 
 
Thus,  in  describing  the  motion  in  the  noninertial  reference  frame,  in  which  the 
imponderability state of particle is achieved, i.e. equality (14) holds, there exists such a space-time 
region  in  which  this  reference  frame  differs  very  little  from  the  inertial  one.  For  this  reason  it  is 
natural  to  call  such  a  reference  frame  the  quasiinertial  one.  Obviously,  there  is  infinitely  many 
quasiinertial  reference  frames  physically  equivalent  to  each  other.  In  particular,  the  quasiinertial 
reference  frames  moving  uniformly  and  rectilinearly  relative  to  each  other  are  physically 
equivalent, if only the motion of particle is considered in the space-time regions, in which the force

quasiinertial reference frames mentioned above can be found to be physically nonequivalent to each 
other. This is due to the fact that because of the vectors  0r  and  0r!  entering into equation (12) there 
can appear in space the preferential regions and directions.

As  is  clarified  in  [4],  in  order  to  describe  the  motion  of  particle  within  the  framework  of 
relativistic  mechanics  we  have  a  right  to  use  both  inertial  and  noninertial  reference  frames.  At

If the particle, being at rest at the origin of the frame of reference, is in the imponderability 
state,  it  is  reasonable  to  consider  its  proper  time  to  flow  uniformly,  i.e.  the  course  of  time  of  the 
particle at different  instants  of  proper time  to be identical. Really, as it was noted in the previous 
section,  in  the  imponderability  state  there  is  no  force  action  on  the  particle  and,  thus,  there  is  no 
reason for changing the course of time at the point where the particle is located. Denote by  A  and 
B   any  two  points  lying  on  the  particle’s  trajectory  in  the  inertial  reference  frame  K ,  which  the 
Bdτ  be the intervals of proper time 
particle passes at the instances of time  At

3. Uniform electric (gravitation) field 

As  an  application  of  the  results  received,  we  first  consider  the  motion  of  a  particle  in  an

which is of the form 
, with  a  and  b  being arbitrary constant vectors, it follows that the

particle  moving  uniformly  and  rectilinearly  in  the  reference  frame  K
state. Thus, the motion of the particle of mass  m  relative to an inertial reference frame under the 
action of a uniform field  F  is equivalent to the motion of a free particle relative to the noninertial 
~′ , which moves relative to the inertial frame with acceleration (27). Transition to 
reference frame K
the noninertial frame of reference allows one to completely exclude from consideration the uniform 
force  field  at  once  in  the  whole  space.  It  should  be  remarked  that  uniform  field  has  no  physical 
sense,  since  such  a  field  does  not  exist  in  nature.  The  real  physical  fields  describing  interaction 
between particles are essentially nonuniform.

Comparing equation (30) with the corresponding nonrelativistic equation (11), one can see that in 
the  relativistic  case  the  transition  to  the  noninertial  reference  frame  does  not  remove  completely 
uniform force field  in  the  whole  space.  The force  field enters  into  the right-hand side of equation 
(30) both in the explicit form and implicitly, through the vector 
0u  (see (28)). According to (30), 
the  uniform  external  field  cannot  be  compensated  for  completely  by  inertial  forces  because  of 
relativistic  corrections  to  the  equation  of  motion.  Note  that  for  uniform  field  the  force  acting  on 
~′  does not depend on the radius-vector of particle  r ′ , but depends 
particle in the reference frame  K
~′  at arbitrary 
on its velocity  u′ . This means that the particle, being at rest in the reference frame  K
point of space, is in the imponderability state. The force effect on the particle arises, however, if we 
 to it, thereby deflecting the particle from the imponderability state.

To establish the character of motion of the particle deflected from the imponderability state, 
let us consider the following initial state:

particle returns to a free state (though, generally speaking,

The  relative  course  of  time  between  points A   and  B ,  lying  on  the  trajectory  of  motion  of

As  a  homogeneous  field,  let  us  consider  the  field  of  gravity  force 

According to (39), if 
 i.e. when a particle moves in homogeneous field, the 
relative course of time along the particle’s trajectory is increased: with increasing time coordinate in 
inertial reference frame time flows faster and faster at the point where the particle is situated.

directed along the  z -axis of  the inertial reference frame  K ,  we can express the force  F  through

As  is  seen  from  (39)-(42),  at  the  free  fall  of  particle  relative  to  inertial  reference  frame,  the  field 
potential decreases and time flows faster and faster at the point of particle’s localization. Calculate 

the proper time interval with the aid of formula (21) (at

We  now  turn  to  the  discussion  of  homogeneous  electric  E   and  magnetic  B   fields, 
supposing for definiteness the field  B  to be directed along the  z -axis. For a charged particle with

6.  Conclusion 

 
The  elucidation  of  the  physical  nature  of  time  is  one  of  the  most  important  problems  of 
theoretical  physics.  The  purpose  of  research  on  the  problem  of  time  is  to  study  the  physical 
properties of time, i.e. to ascertain the possible interrelation between time and material processes. In 
particular, it is of interest to find out 

•  whether  the  flow  of  time  depends  upon  physical  processes  and  whether  the  back 

influence exists of the change of the course of time on physical processes, 

•  what mechanisms of the change of the course of time are available, 
•  what factors are capable to speed up or to slow down the flow of time. 

In  papers  [5-8]  on  the  basis  of  Lorentz  transformations  relating  to  coordinates  of  points, 
lying  on  the  trajectory  of  motion  of  particle  in  a  force  field,  the  phenomenon  of  local  dynamical 
inhomogeneity  of  time  is  predicted.  The  main  result  consists  in  the  proof  that  material  processes 
occurring in a physical system under the action of a force field necessarily influence the course of 
time along the trajectory of motion of particle. The case in point is the change of the course of time 
along particle’s trajectory in one inertial reference frame as compared with that in the other. 

In this paper the next step is made: the relationship is obtained which relates the course of 
time on one path section of a particle when moving in a force field to that on the other path section 
in the same inertial reference frame. The main idea underlying the approach developed results from 
the analysis of Lorentz transformations and consists in that the course of time of a particle moving 
by inertia, i.e. not subject to the influence of a force, should be uniform. 

As  is  known  [17,18],  the  existence  of  dependence  of  the  course  of  time  upon  the 
gravitational  field  potential  is  predicted  with  the  general  theory  of  relativity  (GTR).  According to 
GTR  ([17],  p.303),  time  flows  differently  at  the  different  points  of  space  in  one  and  the  same 
reference frame. Since “gravitational field is nothing more nor less than a change of the space-time 
metric” ([17], p.313), one can assert, apparently, that the change in the course of time is due, in the 
view of GTR, to the change of the 4-space metric. It should be emphasized that in the present paper 
gravitational  field  is  considered  as  an  ordinary  force  field,  and  the  particle  motion  is  supposed  to 
occur in pseudoeuclidian space-time. The main formulas of the article, (22) and (25), describe the 
change in the course of time in an arbitrary force field at different spatial points in one and the same 
inertial reference frame. As is seen from the results received, the change in the course of time in a 
force  field  is  in  no  way  connected  with  the  change  of  space-time  metric.  It  is  conditioned  by  the 
force field action on particle in inertial reference frame and is a direct consequence of the dynamical 
principle underlying relativistic mechanics. 

It should be emphasized that the existence of dependence of the course of time on the state 
of motion of particle in a force field points to the feasibility of controlling the course of time using 
force fields. 

Note  an 

important  peculiarity  of 

the  noninertial  reference  frame 

the 
imponderability  state  of  a  particle  is  attained:  there  is  such  a  space-time  region  in  which  the 
reference frame at hand can be approximately considered as inertial. In connection with the fact that 
such reference frames (it is natural to call them quasiinertial in contradistinction to the true inertial 
reference  frames)  are,  generally  speaking,  not  equivalent  to  each  other  (see  previous  section),  the 
derivation  of  a  rigorous  criterion  for  inertial  reference  frame  acquires  especial  significance.  The 
dynamical  criteria  for  defining  the  inertial  and  noninertial  states  are  considered  in  the  papers  by 
B.I.Peschevitsky  [19].  The  heliocentric  reference  frame  seems  to  be  among  the  quasiinertial 
reference  frames,  being  inertial  with  adequate  accuracy  only  in  a  restricted  region  of  space  (for 
example, within the limits of our Galaxy) [16].

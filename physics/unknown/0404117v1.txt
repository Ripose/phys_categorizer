Abstract  Analyzing the low temperature experimental data of the volume coefficient of 

thermal expansion indicated that the differential of the volume change of the thermal 

expansion correlates linearly to the differential of the internal energy of the system.  This 

assumption was investigated with positive result.  The detected correlation allows 

calculating the volume coefficient of thermal expansion at low temperatures by using the 

Debye function.

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

 

 

At elevated temperatures, the temperature measures the internal energy of the system.  

In the case of ideal gasses the internal energy of a system [E] is equivalent with the 

average translational kinetic energy.

where n is the number of moles, 

AN  is the Avogadro's number, m is the atomic mass, 

v is the atomic velocity,  Bk  is the Boltzmann constant, R is the universal gas constant, 

and T is the temperature.  Since the molar constant-volume heat capacity 

]c[ V  for ideal 

gasses is

The internal energy of the system can also be written as: 

The differential of the internal energy is

The differential of the internal energy, as long as the molar constant-volume heat 

capacity is constant, is linearly correlated to the differential of the temperature.  If there is 

a linear correlation between a thermodynamic quantity and the internal energy then 

replacing the internal energy with the temperature will not change the linearity of the 

correlation.  Outside of the constant region of the molar constant-volume heat capacity 

the correlation will be nonlinear.  The described pattern seems to be consistent with the 

thermodynamic behavior of the volume coefficient of thermal expansion, which will be 

investigated here.

This expression assumes linear correlation between the differentials of the volume 

change and the temperature.  From the physical point of view it makes more sense that 

the size of the volume change correlates to the size of the energy supplied to or taken 

away from the system.  If the volume change of thermal expansion is the linear function 

of the internal energy then the ratio of their differentials should be constant.

The experimental values of the coefficients of the linear thermal expansion3 have been 

compared to the calculated values between zero Kelvin and the Debye temperature for 

randomly selected elements.  The results are plotted on Figure 1.  The correlations are 

excellent for elements (Ag; Al; Au; Cu; Ni; Pb; Pt) with face centered cubic structure, 

very good for Co and Ti with hexagonal closed packing structures and good for element 

(Ba; Cr; Fe; K; V) with body centered cubic structure.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

The good to excellent agreement between the calculated and experimental data is 

consistent with the assumption that the volume change of thermal expansion is linearly 

correlates to the internal energy of the system. 

The detected correlation allows calculating the volume coefficient of thermal 

expansion at low temperatures with the Debye equation.

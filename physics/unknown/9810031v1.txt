Rearrangements of Water Dimer and Hexamer

Abstract. Rearrangement mechanisms of the water dimer and the cage
form of the water hexamer are examined theoretically with particular ref-
erence to tunneling splittings and spectroscopy. The three lowest barrier
rearrangements of the water dimer are characterized by ab initio meth-
ods and compared with the results of previous constrained calculations.
The acceptor-tunneling pathway does not proceed via a direct rotation
around the C2 axis of the acceptor, but rather via relatively asynchronous
rotation of the donor about the hydrogen bond and an associated ‘wag’
of the acceptor. Rearrangements between diﬀerent cage isomers of the
water hexamer are studied for two empirical potentials. The experimen-
tally observed triplet splittings may be the result of ﬂip and bifurcation
rearrangements of the two single-donor, single-acceptor monomers. Two-
dimensional quantum calculations of the nuclear dynamics suggest that
delocalization over more than one cage isomer may occur, especially in
excited states.

This paper was written in October 1996 for Theory of Atomic and
Molecular Clusters edited by Julius Jellinek, which has unfortunately still
failed to appear.

Introduction

Water clusters have proved to be attractive systems for study to both theory
and experiment, particularly in the last two decades. This popularity may be
ascribed in part to the role of water as an almost universal solvent in chemistry
and biochemistry, but also to the importance of developing a fundamental un-
derstanding of intermolecular forces [1-4]. A recent ﬂurry of activity has been
sparked by the advent of far-infrared vibration-rotation tunneling (FIR-VRT)
spectroscopy [5-8], where resolutions of up to 1 MHz have been achieved. These
results provide a new challenge to theory because the tunneling splittings that
can now be resolved necessitate a global view of the potential energy surface
(PES) if they are to be explained. The large amplitude motions which are typ-
ical of such weakly bound Van der Waals complexes sample regions of the PES
that are far removed from the bottom of potential wells, and provide new infor-
mation about the nature of the intermolecular forces. Furthermore, to explain or
predict the tunneling splittings theory must characterize not only minima but
transition states and rearrangement mechanisms.

The interplay between theory and experiment is perhaps best illustrated by
our recently improved understanding of the dynamics exhibited by water trimer,
which began with the FIR-VRT experiment of Pugliano and Saykally [9]. These
authors reported spectra for (D2O)3 characteristic of an oblate symmetric rotor,
with each line split into a regularly spaced quartet and a spacing of roughly
10−4 cm−1. Accurate values for the vibrationally averaged rota-
6 MHz, i.e. 2
tional constants revealed a large negative inertial defect, indicative of extensive
out-of-plane motion of the non-hydrogen-bonded hydrogens. However, a cyclic,
asymmetric global minimum structure for the trimer was established some years
ago in ab initio calculations [10], in agreement with earlier experimental results
[11].

×

The oblate symmetric top spectrum of the trimer has now been explained
by vibrational averaging over large amplitude torsional motions of the free hy-
drogens on the timescale of the FIR-VRT experiment. These large amplitude
motions are associated with a facile ‘ﬂip’ rearrangement where a free hydrogen
moves from one side of the plane deﬁned by the three oxygen atoms to the other.
This mechanism was probably ﬁrst characterized for an empirical potential by
Owicki et al. [12]. An ab initio pathway has been presented by Wales [13] and
the corresponding transition state was also characterized by Fowler and Schae-
fer [14]. Wales identiﬁed two other degenerate rearrangement mechanisms for
the trimer with rather larger barriers than the ﬂip, and suggested that one of
them (christened the ‘donor’ or ‘bifurcation’ pathway) might be responsible for
the quartet splittings observed experimentally [13]. In the associated transition
state one monomer acts as a double donor to a neighbour which acts as a double
acceptor in a conﬁguration similar to that of the ‘donor tunneling’ transition

state in the water dimer, discussed in

Subsequent experiments [15-16] assigned new transitions for (H2O)3 and
(D2O)3 which revealed rigorously symmetric rotor structure, in contrast to the
strongly perturbed band that was initially investigated by Pugliano and Saykally
[9]. All the transitions reported by Liu et al. [15] and Suzuki and Blake [16] show
a regular quartet splitting of every rovibrational transition. Liu et al. reported
that their new spectra were consistent with the G(48) group suggested by the
mechanisms discovered by Wales [13]. Walsh and Wales have recently studied the
bifurcation mechanism in more detail and discovered that six slightly diﬀerent
alternatives exist, depending upon the level of the calculation employed [17].

Numerous other treatments of the water trimer have focused on the break-
down of the total energy into many-body contributions and the eﬀects of electron
correlation [18-22], the development of torsional potential energy surfaces [23-25],
the calculation of torsional energy levels using the discrete variable representa-
tion (DVR) [26-29] and quantum simulations of the nuclear dynamics using the
diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method [30-31].

§

In the present contribution we report new results for the water dimer and
water hexamer, which lie at the two limits of the size range for which high
resolution data have been obtained. Unconstrained pathways do not seem to
have been described before for the three rearrangements of the water dimer

which lead to observable splittings or shifts in the pattern of rovibrational energy
levels. In particular, we ﬁnd that the acceptor tunneling mechanism is not simply
a rotation about the local C2 axis of the acceptor monomer. For water hexamer
we employ two empirical intermolecular potentials to examine the cage isomers
and show that these structures are connected by facile, non-degenerate single
ﬂips of the two single-donor, single-acceptor monomers. Two-dimensional DVR
calculations are performed to investigate these motions. First we give a brief
overview of the eﬀective molecular symmetry group which must be employed to
classify the energy levels of ﬂoppy molecules.

2 The Eﬀective Molecular Symmetry Group

The observation of quantum tunneling eﬀects in high resolution spectra pro-
vides indirect information about the corresponding rearrangement mechanisms.
To make use of this information we need to employ group theory to classify the
energy levels of such systems. Point groups prove satisfactory when the molecule
under consideration is rigid on the appropriate experimental timescale. However,
molecular potential energy surfaces generally contain local minima correspond-
ing to permutational isomers of any given stationary point. We will adopt the
nomenclature of Bone et al. [32] where a ‘structure’ is understood to mean a
particular molecular geometry and a ‘version’ is a particular labelled permuta-
tional isomer of a given structure. Minima which are directly connected by a
given rearrangement are said to be ‘adjacent’.

Tunneling splittings may be observed when rovibronic wavefunctions local-
ized in the potential wells corresponding to diﬀerent versions interfere with each
other. For example, the ammonia molecule displays doublet splittings because
pairs of permutational isomers are interconverted by the inversion mechanism in
which the molecule passes through a planar transition state [33-34]. If the bar-
rier corresponding to a certain rearrangement mechanism is suﬃciently low, the
path length suﬃciently short, and the associated eﬀective mass suﬃciently small
then tunneling may occur. Hence tunneling splittings can usually be associated
with a low energy transition state corresponding to a degenerate rearrangement
mechanism [35] which links diﬀerent versions of the same structure, as opposed
to diﬀerent structures where the energy levels would not be in resonance. Degen-
erate rearrangements can be either symmetric or asymmetric, depending upon
whether the two sides of the corresponding path are related by symmetry [36].
We follow Murrell and Laidler’s deﬁnition of a transition state as a stationary
point with a single negative Hessian eigenvalue [37].

The energy levels of non-rigid molecules can be classiﬁed using the Complete
Nuclear Permutation-Inversion (CNPI) group which is the direct product of the
group containing all possible permutations of identical nuclei and the inversion
group. The latter group contains only the identity operation, E, and the oper-
ation of inversion of all particle coordinates through the space-ﬁxed origin, E∗,
which commutes with all the permutations. The CNPI group is a true symme-
try group of the full molecular Hamiltonian in the absence of external ﬁelds,

and its elements are generally referred to as permutation-inversion operations.
However, the order of this group increases factorially for systems containing in-
creasing numbers of atoms of the same element, and rapidly becomes diﬃcult
to use. Fortunately, Longuet-Higgins showed that it not necessary to consider
the whole of the CNPI group, but rather only the permutation-inversions which
correspond to tunneling splittings that are resolvable for a given experiment
[38]. The corresponding rearrangement mechanisms are said to be ‘feasible’. The
resulting subgroup of the CNPI group is known as the eﬀective molecular sym-
metry (MS) group. For rigid molecules the appropriate MS group is isomorphic
to the usual rigid molecule point group [39-42]. The corresponding permutation-
inversions simply correspond to overall rotation of the system, and are therefore
always feasible.

If there exists a non-trivial feasible rearrangement with a ﬁnite barrier then
the MS group is enlarged and the wavefunctions which transform according to
irreducible representations of this group are linear combinations of the functions
localized in each well. In general, a given mechanism will not link all the possible
versions of a given structure but rather the versions will be partitioned into a
number of closed sets with equivalent reaction graphs for each set. If we consider
a representative set of versions all of which can be interconverted by repeated
application of the feasible rearrangement, then the corresponding wavefunction
must be a linear combination of the localized functions from members of this
set. The delocalized wavefunctions can be found by solving a secular problem,
just as in the linear combination of molecular orbitals approach to electronic
structure. If the wavefunctions decay rapidly in the classically forbidden regions
of the PES between minima then it may be suﬃcient to consider only nearest-
neighbour interactions and the resulting splitting pattern is then determined
largely by symmetry. The connectivity of the reaction graph, the associated MS
group and the splitting pattern can all be found automatically by a computer
program once a minimal set of generator permutation-inversions is known [43].

3 Geometry Optimizations and Potentials

The geometry optimizations and calculations of rearrangement pathways de-
scribed in the following sections were all performed by eigenvector-following
[44]. Details of the precise implementation have been given elsewhere [45-46].
Analytic ﬁrst and second derivatives of the energy were calculated at every step.
In the ab initio calculations these derivatives were all generated by the CAD-
PAC program [47], and Cartesian coordinates were used throughout. Pathways
were calculated by taking small displacements of 0.03 a0 away from a transition
state both parallel and antiparallel to the transition vector, and then employing
eigenvector-following energy minimization to ﬁnd the associated minimum. The
pathways obtained by this procedure have been compared to steepest-descent
paths and pathways that incorporate a kinetic metric [48] in previous work—the
mechanism is generally found to be represented correctly [17].

Calculations employing rigid body intermolecular potentials were performed
using the ORIENT3 program [49-51], which contains the same optimization
package adapted for centre-of-mass/orientational coordinates. This program can
treat intermolecular potentials based upon Stone’s distributed multipoles [52-53]
and distributed polarizabilities [54-55]; simpler models based upon point charges
and Lennard-Jones interactions fall within this framework. Calculations for the
water hexamer in
5 were performed using the relatively sophisticated ASP-
W2 potential of Millot and Stone [56] (somewhat modiﬁed from the published
version) and the much simpler but widely-used TIP4P form [57-58].

§

In the ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations for (H2O)2 two basis sets
were considered. The smaller double-ζ [59-60] plus polarization (DZP) basis em-
ployed polarization functions consisting of a single set of p functions on each
hydrogen atom (exponent 1.0) and a set of six d functions on each oxygen atom
(exponent 0.9) to give a total of 26 basis functions per monomer. The larger ba-
sis set, denoted DZP+diﬀ, includes the above DZP functions with an additional
diﬀuse s function on each hydrogen atom (exponent 0.0441) and diﬀuse sets of
s and p functions on each oxygen atom (exponents 0.0823 and 0.0651 for s and
p respectively) [14], to give 32 basis functions per monomer. Correlation cor-
rections were obtained through both second order Møller-Plesset (MP2) theory
[61] and density functional theory (DFT). In the DFT calculations we employed
the Becke nonlocal exchange functional [62] and the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation
functional [63] (together referred to as BLYP); derivatives of the grid weights
were not included and the core electrons were not frozen. Numerical integra-
tion of the BLYP functionals was performed using grids between the CADPAC
‘MEDIUM’ and ‘HIGH’ options. The ‘MEDIUM’ grids were not accurate enough
to give the right number of negative Hessian eigenvalues, whereas the ‘HIGH’
grids contained more points than necessary. CADPAC actually uses diﬀerent
sized grids for diﬀerent parts of the calculation [47]; in the present work these
grids contained 14,386 and 97,008 points after removal of those with densities
below the preset tolerances. Calculations were deemed to be converged when
the root-mean-square gradient fell below 10−6 atomic units. This is suﬃcient to
reduce the six ‘zero’ normal mode frequencies to less than 1 cm−1 in the HF and
MP2 calculations. Because derivatives of the grid weights were not included, the
largest of the six ‘zeros’ can be as big as 20 cm−1 for the DFT stationary points.
Three additional parameters are useful in describing the rearrangement mech-
anisms. The ﬁrst is the integrated path length, S, which was calculated as a sum
over eigenvector-following steps. The second is the distance between the two
minima in nuclear conﬁguration space, D. The third is the moment ratio of
displacement [64], γ, which gives a measure of the cooperativity of the rear-
rangement:

where Qi(s) is the position vector in Cartesian coordinates for atom i in mini-
mum s, etc., and N is the number of atoms. If every atom undergoes the same

displacement in one Cartesian component then γ = 1, while if only one atom
has one non-zero component then γ = N , i.e. 18 for (H2O)6.

4 Rearrangements of Water Dimer

There have been many experimental investigations of the water dimer [65] fol-
lowing the original work of Dyke, Mack and Muenter [66]. Most recently, a
complete characterization of the tunneling dynamics in a vibrationally excited
state of (D2O)2 has been presented [67]. The dimer rovibronic energy levels were
ﬁrst classiﬁed in terms of permutation-inversion group theory by Dyke [68], and
Coudert and Hougen applied their internal axis approach to the intermolecular
dynamics using an empirical potential [69-71]. Smith et al. [72] performed ab
initio calculations and identiﬁed three true transition states for (H2O)2; they
also performed constrained calculations of the donor-tunneling pathway. In this
section we will describe unconstrained pathway calculations for all three rear-
rangements; the energetics of the various stationary points at diﬀerent levels
of theory are summarized in Table 1 and counterpoise-corrected [73] binding
energies (including monomer relaxation [74]) are given in Table 2.

There are a total of 2

4!/2 = 48 distinct versions of the water dimer
global minimum on the PES (we divide by two because the rigid molecule point
group has order two [32]). However, mechanisms which involve the making and
breaking of covalent bonds lie much too high in energy to give rise to observable
tunneling splittings. The largest possible MS group which can pertain when
(2!)2 = 16, where the
covalent bond-breaking is not feasible has order 2
ﬁrst factor accounts for the inversion mechanism, the second factor accounts
for permutation of the two oxygen nuclei, and the last term accounts for the
permutation of the two hydrogen (or deuterium) atoms within each monomer.
This group may be denoted G(16) and is isomorphic to the point group D4h
[68]. Since the equilibrium geometry has Cs symmetry the maximum number of
distinct versions that can be interconverted without breaking covalent bonds is
16/2 = 8.

In the equilibrium Cs geometry one ‘donor’ monomer acts as a single
hydrogen-bond donor to the other ‘acceptor’ molecule [75]. The largest tunneling
splitting is due to a mechanism in which the two hydrogen atoms of the acceptor
monomer are eﬀectively interchanged, for which Smith et al. [72] reported a bar-
rier of 206 cm−1. In the present work a planar transition state of Cs symmetry
was found for both basis sets in the HF calculations, but this changed to an out-
of-plane C1 structure when correlation corrections were applied, in agreement

with Smith et al. [72]. The pathway is shown in Fig. 1, and corresponds to a
‘methylamine-type’ process [76] rather than a direct rotation about the local C2
axis of the acceptor monomer. The path is represented by nine snapshots where
the ﬁrst and last frames are the two minima, the middle frame is the transition
state and three additional frames on each side of the path were selected to best
illustrate the mechanism. All the pathways in the present work were visualized
using Mathematica [77].

The above mechanism is in agreement with the analysis of Pugliano et al.
[67] for the ground state acceptor tunneling path. The generator permutation-
inversion corresponding to the labelling scheme of Fig. 1 is (34), and it connects
the versions in pairs. Hence each rigid-dimer rovibrational level is split into
two by this process. Experimentally the ground state splitting due to acceptor
tunneling is [78] 2.47 cm−1, in good agreement with a ﬁve-dimensional treatment
of the nuclear dynamics by Althorpe and Clary [79], which yielded a value of
2.34 cm−1. The MS group for the rigid dimer labelled according to Fig. 1 contains
only the identity, E, and the permutation-inversion (34)*, where hydrogens three
and four change places and all coordinates are inverted through the space-ﬁxed
origin. The appropriate MS group when the generator (34) operation is feasible
contains the elements E, E*, (34) and (34)*.

The next largest splitting is caused by donor-acceptor interchange. For this
process Smith et al. [72] found a cyclic transition state with Ci symmetry and an
associated barrier of 304 cm−1. In this rearrangement, for which the calculated
pathway is shown in Fig. 2, the roles of the donor and acceptor monomers are
interchanged. An appropriate generator for the labelling scheme of Fig. 2 is
(AB)(1423), i.e. oxygen A is replaced by oxygen B, hydrogen 1 is replaced by
hydrogen 4, hydrogen 4 is replaced by hydrogen 2 etc. This generator is not
unique—one could also choose (AB)(14)(23)* and obtain the same MS group.

If donor-acceptor interchange is the only feasible mechanism then the ver-
sions are connected in sets of four and the MS group has eight members:
class 1 contains E, class 2 contains (12)(34), class 3 contains (AB)(1423) and
(AB)(1324), class 4 contains (34)* and (12)*, and class 5 contains (AB)(14)(23)*

rangement mechanisms of the water dimer described in §4.

and (AB)(13)(24)*. The splitting pattern in the simplest H¨uckel-type approxi-
mation [80] is:

2βda(A1),

0(E),

2βda(B1),

(2)

where βda is the donor-acceptor-interchange tunneling matrix element and we
have labelled the levels according to appropriate irreducible representations of
the G(8) group which is a subgroup of G(16) [68]. When this process and acceptor
tunneling are both feasible the MS group has order 16, i.e. the largest MS group
possible without breaking covalent bonds, and is isomorphic to D4h [68]. The
versions are then connected in sets of eight and the splitting pattern is:

−

βa + 2βda(A+

(3)

where βa is the acceptor-tunneling matrix element. Experimentally, the tunneling
splittings due to donor-acceptor-interchange are about a factor of ﬁve smaller
than those associated with acceptor tunneling.

The third process which is generally presumed to have an observable eﬀect
on the energy level diagram is donor tunneling, but this can only lead to energy

level shifts rather than further splittings because G(16) is the largest MS group
possible without breaking covalent bonds. Smith et al. [72] calculated a barrier
of 658 cm−1 for this mechanism, and the corresponding pathway found in the
present work is shown in Fig. 3. An appropriate generator permutation-inversion
for the labelling scheme of Fig. 3 is (12)(34), and on its own this process would
simply lead to doublet splittings with versions linked in pairs and an MS group of
order 4. However, when combined with the other two mechanisms the eigenvalues
of the corresponding secular problem (assuming a H¨uckel-type approximation
[80]) are:

βa + 2βda + βd(A+
1 ),

This pattern is in complete agreement with that obtained by Althorpe and Clary
[79] and with the model calculations of Coudert and Hougen [69-71]. Since the
tunneling levels are no longer in plus-minus pairs we conclude that the presence
of donor tunneling introduces odd-membered rings into the reaction graph [81].
The DZP+diﬀ/BLYP energy proﬁles for all three rearrangements are shown
in Fig. 4. A maximum step size of 0.1 a0 was used for the left-hand side of the
acceptor-tunneling path. This value was increased to 0.15 a0 for all the other
paths, resulting in slightly less smooth proﬁles but much faster execution time.

5 Water Hexamer

Liu et al. [82] have recently identiﬁed a VRT band of (H2O)6 at 83 cm−1 on
the basis of an isotope mixture test. In contrast to smaller water clusters the
lowest energy isomer of the hexamer is probably not cyclic, and the four lowest
energy structures found by Tsai and Jordan [83] lie within an energy range of
only 100 cm−1. The most accurate calculations conducted so far suggest that a
‘cage’ structure lies lowest, followed closely by ‘prism’ and ‘book’ forms (Fig. 5)
[84]. DMC calculations were used to ﬁnd the vibrationally averaged rotational
constants for each structure using an empirical potential, and the best match
was found for the cage structure. On this basis the spectrum was assigned to the
cage [82].

There are several unanswered questions concerning the interpretation of this
experiment. First, if a number of isomers lie so close together in energy, how is it
that only one of them seems to be observed? One possibility might be that the
other isomers are also present in the beam, but do not have a spectral feature in
the range scanned experimentally. In fact, simulations reveal numerous isomers
of all three morphologies illustrated in Fig. 5 with diﬀerent arrangements of
the hydrogen bonds. The remaining discussion will concentrate on the cage and
the results of calculations using the ASP-W2 and TIP4P potentials described
in
3. The ASP-W2 form should be very similar to that employed in the DMC
calculations of nuclear dynamics by Liu et al. [82]. However, we note that the
cage isomer is also not the lowest in energy for either of these potentials, although

§

inclusion of zero-point energy can alter the ordering [82]. In fact, for the ASP-
W2 potential the cyclic structure of the water pentamer is also not the global
minimum, but nevertheless, the lowest energy rearrangements of this isomer are
quite well reproduced [46].

For the ASP-W2 potential only the ﬁrst order induction energy was consid-
ered, since iterating this term to convergence is time-consuming and was found to
make no qualitative diﬀerence to results for the water pentamer in previous work
[46]. There are then four isomers of the cage structure shown in Fig. 5 diﬀering
only in the position of the free hydrogen atoms of the two terminal, single-donor,
single-acceptor monomers (Fig. 6). No low energy degenerate rearrangements of
these isomers were found, but transition states were located for non-degenerate
single ﬂip and bifurcation mechanisms. For every single ﬂip process there is an
analogous bifurcation which links diﬀerent permutational isomers of the same
structures. Details of the paths are given in Table 3 and the single ﬂip and bi-
furcation pathways linking cage isomers C1 and C2 are illustrated in Fig. 7 and
Fig. 8. The other paths are omitted for brevity.

The experimental VRT transition has been assigned to a torsional motion of
one of the single-donor, single-acceptor monomers, and the form of the spectrum
has been described as ‘near-prolate’ [82]. Note that even with full vibrational av-
eraging over the four cage isomers in Fig. 6 a symmetric top spectrum would not
be expected. Experimentally, every line was found to be split into a triplet with
intensities in the ratio 9:6:1 and equal spacings of 1.92 MHz [82]. Liu et al. have
explained how this pattern might emerge in terms of hypothetical degenerate re-
arrangements of the cage which they assumed must interchange the hydrogens of
two monomers in almost equivalent environments. This could lead to a doublet
of doublets where the middle lines are essentially superimposed. The resulting
nuclear spin weights can then reproduce the observed intensity pattern [82].

Liu et al. additionally suggested that the two monomers in question might
be the two terminal molecules which we have found to undergo ﬂip and bifur-

the cage isomers have been found to date. Since a combination of sequential
bifurcation and ﬂip rearrangements would achieve the desired eﬀect we will now
consider the splittings that might result in more detail. The eight single ﬂip
and bifurcation processes described above for the cage isomers link 16 versions:
four of each isomer. To distinguish between versions of each isomer we need
only specify which of the two hydrogens is free, and so we label the hydrogens
on the terminal monomer with two double-acceptor neighbours a and b and
those on the monomer with two double-donor neighbours c and d. The four rel-
evant versions of the C1 isomer may then be written C1(ac), C1(bc), C1(ad)
and C1(bd). The interconnectivity of all 16 versions is shown in Fig. 9. If we
make a H¨uckel-type approximation then the resulting secular determinant is:

where fij and bij are the appropriate tunneling matrix elements between Ci and
Cj. We can simplify this problem by focusing on one of the isomers, say C1,
and considering an eﬀective generator [85] corresponding to a ﬂip and a bifur-
cation (in either order). The reaction graph can then be represented as shown
in Fig. 10, where the double lines indicate that there are two routes between
each pair of versions depending upon whether the ﬂip or bifurcation comes ﬁrst.
The eﬀective MS group contains the elements E, (ab), (bc) and (ab)(bc) and
is isomorphic to C2v. If the four connections are each represented by the same
tunneling matrix element β then the energy level pattern will be identical to
that obtained in the H¨uckel treatment of the π system of butadiene, i.e.

where the correspondence between the MS group elements and the operations

The accidental degeneracy of the A2 and B1 states would be broken at higher
resolution. The relative nuclear spin weights for rovibronic states are easily shown
to be 9:3:3:1 for (H2O)6 and 4:2:2:1 for (D2O)6 corresponding to A1:A2:B1:B2. If
the accidental degeneracy is unresolved then the relative intensities of the three
triplet components would be 9:6:1 for (H2O)6 and 4:4:1 for (D2O)6.

The above analysis leads to the same result as that obtained by Liu et al. [82],
who considered the consequences of hypothetical direct permutations (ab) and
(cd). However, in the present picture the tunneling between diﬀerent versions of
the four cage isomers does not occur through a single barrier, which might explain
why the splittings are rather small. For this framework to be consistent we would
expect to ﬁnd similar splitting patterns for all four cage isomers, although the
magnitude of the splitting could be diﬀerent for each one.

The same analysis would also hold for a second family of cage isomers where
the double acceptor monomers are adjacent. However, the four corresponding
isomers in this case lie several hundred wavenumbers higher in energy than

and dashed lines the four bifurcations.

those considered above. Several mechanisms interconverting the two cage families
were found in the set of 900 pathways calculated for the hexamer in this study.
One further point worthy of consideration is that the experiment measures the
diﬀerence in tunneling splittings between diﬀerent rovibrational states. If the
observed vibrational transition does indeed correspond to the torsional motion
of a single-donor, single-acceptor monomer then the splitting in the excited state
could be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the ground state.

For the TIP4P potential the situation is slightly diﬀerent because there are
only two cage isomers rather than four. The single-donor, single-acceptor that has
two double-donor neighbours exhibits only one torsional minimum intermediate
between the two states found in C1-C4 above. The other single-donor, single-
acceptor has the same two torsional states as in C1-C4, and undergoes single ﬂip

and bifurcation rearrangements as before. For the single-donor, single-acceptor
monomer in the intermediate torsional state a direct degenerate rearrangement
corresponding to a bifurcated transition state was found. The pathways are sum-
marized in Table 4 where we label the two isomers C1′ and C2′. Illustrations
of these rearrangements are omitted for brevity. A degenerate bifurcation rear-
rangement of the C2′ isomer could not be located, despite starting a number of
transition state searches from points around the expected geometry.

Although the topology of the PES is diﬀerent for the TIP4P potential the
above rearrangements could produce the same tunneling splittings and intensity
pattern as before, since there are still pathways linking all four versions of each
isomer. Unfortunately there is insuﬃcient experimental information to distin-
guish the two possibilities, and it is quite possible that neither scenario is correct.

Due to the relatively large number of degrees of freedom and the uncertainties
associated with the choice of empirical potential more accurate theoretical treat-
ments of the dynamics will not be easy. However, it may not be a bad approxi-
mation to neglect relaxations of the rest of the cage in considering the dynamics
of the two single-donor, single-acceptor monomers. Two-dimensional quantum
calculations of the torsional dynamics of these two molecules were performed
under this approximation using the C1 geometry and the discrete variable rep-
resentation [86] (DVR). These calculations follow the three-dimensional DVR
calculations of Sabo et al. [29] for (H2O)3 in employing a model Hamiltonian in
which only rotation about the hydrogen-bonded O

H bond is permitted:

where φ1 and φ2 are the two torsional angles in question and the value of Beﬀ
was taken to be 19.63 cm−1 for H2O and 9.82 cm−1 for D2O. For each torsional
degree of freedom the basis functions were chosen as:

giving a total of (2N + 1)2 basis functions for a given value of N . The DVR grid
points are then uniformly spaced in each coordinate:

,

j = 1, 2, . . . , 2N + 1.

Hence we obtain a direct product DVR with grid points (φj

known analytic form for the kinetic energy operator [87] we obtain the Hamil-
tonian matrix elements:

The lowest eigenvalues were converged to an accuracy better than 0.1 cm−1
for both (H2O)6 and (D2O)6 at a value N = 14; an iterative Lanczos matrix
diagonalization procedure was employed.

The lowest eight eigenvectors for (H2O)6 along with assignments are shown
in Fig. 11 for ASP-W2 and Fig. 12 for TIP4P. In both cases the ranges of the
torsional angles have been restricted to exclude regions where the amplitude is
essentially always zero. The centre of each surface corresponds to the geometry
with both free hydrogens in intermediate positions. Not surprisingly, the wave-
functions for the TIP4P potential are all delocalized over torsional space, and
can be classiﬁed according to the number of nodes in the φ1 and φ2 directions.

in the wells corresponding to C1, C2 and C3. However, the fourth, seventh and
eighth functions appear to be delocalized over two isomers in each case. For this
potential the wavefunctions are described in terms of localized functions in the
four diﬀerent wells, e.g. C1(1,0) is the function localized in the C1 well with one
node in the φ1 direction and none in the φ2 direction. The results for (D2O)2
are omitted for brevity, and can be obtained from the author on request.

Clearly we cannot assign the experimental transition on the basis of these
model calculations. However, the fact that both potentials exhibit some delocal-
ization between diﬀerent cage isomers suggests that vibrational averaging of the
structure is likely, especially in an excited torsional state. Unfortunately, it does
not seem to be possible to admit both the ﬂip and bifurcation rearrangements
without including at least three angular degrees of freedom for each of the two
monomers in question. Such calculations are considerably more diﬃcult, and are
left for future work.

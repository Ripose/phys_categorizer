Abstract

Single-shot  ultrafast  spectroscopy  based  on  the  frequency  encoding  of  transient

absorbance  kinetics  (FDSS)  is  demonstrated.  These  kinetics  are  sampled  spectrally  using

linearly  chirped  pulses  derived  from  a  Ti:sapphire  laser.  A  variable  length  grating  pair

compressor is used to provide group velocity dispersion out to -1.6 ps2 and achieve the sampling

of 512 channels per a 2-to-160 ps window with sensitivity > 5x10-4. The possibilities of FDSS

are illustrated with studies of three photon ionization of liquid water and one-photon excitation

of a thin-film amorphous Si:H semiconductor.

I. INTRODUCTION

This  work  completes  a  series  of  papers  on  frequency  domain  "single-shot"
transient absorption spectroscopy (FDSS) originally suggested by Beddard et al.  1  and
further developed at our laboratory. 2,3  Our aim is to demonstrate that this technique is as

general and versatile as the familiar pump-probe spectroscopy (PPS), but surpasses the

latter in the averaging efficiency. We emphasize that the "single-shot" aspect of the FDSS

spectroscopy  relates  to  the  fact  that  the  entire  transient  absorbance  (TA)  kinetics  are

sampled for each probe pulse; in fact, many of such kinetics may need be averaged to

obtain  the  desirable  signal-to-noise  (S/N)  ratio.  The  single  shot  nature  of  this

spectroscopy distinguishes it from the PPS in which the kinetics are collected in a point-

to-point fashion, by stepping the delay time of the probe pulse relative to that of the pump

pulse.  By  its  very  nature,  FDSS  is  less  sensitive  to  shot-to-shot  laser  and  sample

instabilities, and this feature is the chief (but not the only) advantage of this technique.

Another  important  advantage  is  the  elimination  of  the  time-consuming  mechanical

movement of the delay line, which also improves averaging efficiency.

Like  several  other  spectroscopy  techniques  based  on  frequency  encoding  of

temporal information (see refs. 2 and 3 for a brief review), FDSS imprints the kinetics

onto  the  phase  and,  eventually,  the  spectrum  of  the  probe  light.  A  linear  chirp  is
introduced  into  a  Gaussian  probe  pulse  centered  at  the  frequency  ω
frequency-dependent  phase  φ ω(

(GVD).  This  probe  pulse  is  delayed  in  time  by  T  relative  to  the  pump  pulse,  passed

through a sample, and the spectrum of the transmitted light is analyzed and normalized

by the spectrum of a reference beam derived from the same probe light before it interacts

with  the  sample.  The  FDSS  signal  S

pattern strongly depends on the phase of the complex refraction index of photoinduced
species, 1-3 and this phase may be obtained by the analysis of this pattern. 2,3 Thus, FDSS
combines the features of the TA spectroscopy and chirped pulse interferometry. 3   Since

the  GVD  can  be  changed  over  several  orders  of  magnitude  by  changing  the  distance
between  the  gratings  in  the  grating  pair  compressor,  4  the  time  window  accessible  to

FDSS  spectroscopy  is  widely  tunable,  from  a  few  picoseconds  to  hundreds  of
picoseconds. 2,3,4  This sampling window is given by  s p

Gaussian probe pulse (before chirping). With the typical compressor designs that are used
for chirped-pulse amplification (CPA),  4 "single-shot"  kinetic  measurements  over  300-

500 ps are possible. In Sec. II of this paper and in ref. 3, we describe a tandem PPS-FDSS

setup based on a variable-length grating compressor, in which the time window of the

observation can be continuously changed between 2 and 160 ps.

In  the  present  study,  we  demonstrate  the  advantages  of  FDSS  for  two
photosystems: liquid water flowed in a 160 µm thick high-speed jet ionized by absorption
of three or more 400 nm photons (Sec. III.A) and a 1.3 µm thin film of amorphous Si:H

semiconductor  in  which  charge  separation  is  induced  by  400  nm  light.  Two  other

examples of the use of FDSS are given in ref. 3. It is shown in the present work that (i)

the FDSS technique yields superior signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio to that of the PPS for the

same acquisition time in a situation when amplitude variations are 50-100% of the TA

3

signal  and  (ii)  this  spectroscopy  is  suitable  both  for  thick  and  thin  samples,  including

films that exhibit well-resolved interference fringes at the probe wavelengths.

II. EXPERIMENTAL.

A  1.3  µm  thick  film  of  undoped  amorphous  (a-)  Si:H  alloy  (8  at.  %  of  H)

deposited  on  1  mm  suprasil  substrate  was  obtained  from  Prof.  H.  Fritzsche  of  the
University of Chicago (see ref. 5 for more detail). Pure water with conductivity < 2x10-9
Ω−1 cm-1 was flowed using a 160 µm thick high-speed jet. The linear velocity of the fluid

was > 1 m/s. All measurements were carried out at 295 K.

The diagram of the setup is shown in Fig. 1; more details are given in ref. 3. The

pump and probe pulses were derived from a femtosecond Ti:sapphire system. 800 nm

pulses from the oscillator were stretched to 80 ps in a 1200 g/mm grating stretcher. These

2 nJ pulses were then amplified to 4 mJ in a two-stage multipass Ti:sapphire amplifier.

The  repetition  rate  of    the  amplifier  was  1  kHz  and  the  pulse  to  pulse  stability  was

typically 3%. The output from the amplifier was split 1:20. The main part of the beam

was passed through a grating compressor that yielded Gaussian probe pulses of 50 fs full

width  at  half  maximum  (FWHM)  and  3  mJ  centered  at  800  nm.  These  pulses  were

delayed using a retroreflector RR1 on a double path 1 m motorized translation stage TS2
and doubled in frequency using a 400 µm β-BaB2O4 crystal (SHG in Fig. 1). The typical
maximum output of the 400 nm light was 80 µJ (100-200 fs FWHM).

The  probe  pulse  was  chirped  using  a  variable  length  grating  pair  compressor

(1200  g/mm)  in  which  the  larger  (11  cm  wide)  grating  was  mounted  on  a  motorized

translation stage TS1. This design gave us up to 55 cm of the slanted distance between

the  gratings  for  compression  (that  corresponds  to  maximum  GVD  of  -1.6  ps2).  The

spectrum of the compressed beam was continuously monitored using a miniature fiber

optics spectrometer (FBO).The GVD was obtained from eq. (1).

The main part of the compressed beam was passed through a 50% beam splitter

(BS). One beam was used as a reference, another as a probe. Before this beam splitter, the

4

800 nm beam was passed through a 2-3 mm aperture (A) and attenuated down to < 1 nJ.

To  eliminate  the  possibility  of  coherent  artifacts,  the  pump  and  probe  pulses  were

perpendicularly  polarized.  The  800  and  400  nm  beams  were  focused  with  achromatic

lenses L1 and L2 and overlapped in the sample (SM) at 6.5o. The transmitted probe was

collimated using a thin lens L3, and the "signal" and "reference" beams were used for

either the standard pump-probe or for FDSS detection (see ref. 3 for more detail). The

vertical bars shown in the PPS kinetics given in Figs. 2(b), 3(a), and 4 represent 95%

confidence limits for each data point.

In  the  FDSS  experiment,  the  probe  and  reference  beams  were  focussed  on  a

diffuser (DF) and the monochromator slit with a cylindrical lens (CL). With an  f = 27 cm

monochromator  (SPEX  model  270M)  equipped  with  a  1200  g/mm  grating,  a  spectral
resolution of 2-5 cm-1 was achieved for a 50-200 µm slit opening. A cooled 512 channel

dual diode array (Princeton Instruments DIDA512) was used for detection. The typical

duty cycle of this detector was 70%, with 60 ms exposure to the laser light per frame.

Several  such  frames  were  averaged,  and  series  with  the  pump  pulse  off  and  on  were

alternated. A mechanical shutter (SH2 in Fig. 1) was used to block the pump light. The

ratios of the probe and the reference signals were calculated for each acquisition channel,

and the "pump on" ratios were normalized by the "pump off" ones to obtain the optical
density  ∆OD

  for  each  channel.  100-500  such  "on/off"

series were averaged to obtain the kinetic profiles shown in the next section. Before the

experiment,  "pump  on"  and  "pump  off"  dark  signals  with  the  probe  light  blocked  by

another  shutter  (SH1  in  Fig.  1)  were  collected  and  subtracted  from  the  spectra.  In  a

typical "blank" experiment with the pump beam blocked, the "on" and "off" series for the
total of 3x104 pulses converged to an optical density of 2x10-5 and the standard deviation
across the spectrum was  5x10-4.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.

A. Photoionization of neat water.

The conduction band of liquid water is positioned 8-9 eV above the ground state

and simultaneous absorption of three 400 nm (3.1 eV) photons is sufficient to ionize this

liquid. 6 In the course of this ionization, an electron is injected into the solvent bulk ca. 1

nm  away  from  the  parent  molecule;  these  "hot"  electrons  rapidly  (<  5  ps)  thermalize

yielding the so-called "hydrated electron",  eaq

− , that has a broad absorption band across

the  300-1300  nm  range,  centered  at  720  nm  (at  25oC).  7  This band corresponds to the

bound-to-bound  (1
s

p→ )  transition  of  the  electron  localized  in  a  spherical  solvent

2

cavity.  7    Since the absorption band of this hydrated electron is much broader than the

spectral width of the 800 nm probe pulse, this spectrum is flat over the sampling range

and shows little time evolution after the first few picoseconds.

A three 400 nm photon absorption coefficient for water of 900 cm3/TW2 has been

reported;  8  recently,  it  has  been  revised  to  270  cm3/TW2  and  a  quantum  yield  of  0.41

hydrated electrons per 3 photons absorbed was estimated. 9 When the radiance of 400 nm

photons  exceeds  0.6-1.2  TW/cm2,  another  400  nm  photon  may  be  absorbed  by  the

electron which is then promptly injected deep into the conduction band of the solvent

(Fig. 2(a)). In less than 200 fs, this electron localizes several nanometers away from the

parent  hole. 10  As  a  result,  the  "3+1"  photoexcitation  process  makes  the  geminate

recombination less efficient. 6,9,10  The fraction of hydrated electrons that escape geminate

recombination with the hole at t=500 ns increases from 70% to 92% (Fig. 2(b)) as the

average width of the electron-hole distribution increases from 1.15 nm (for the 3-photon

process) to 2.7 nm (for the "3+1" process). 6

6

We  chose  this  photosystem  because  it  provides  one  of  the  worst  scenarios  for

PPS: The high, mixed photon order of the ionization causes strong shot-to-shot variation

in the electron yield. This yield varies strongly across the excitation beam and along the

path of the 400 nm light. For an average pump radiance of 0.1-0.4 TW/cm2, a switchover

of the dynamic behavior from 3 photon to the "3+1" process occurs at the higher end of

this range. Since water breaks down at 1-5 TW/cm2,  the  photolysis  is  carried  out  in  a

high-speed jet, and the light scatter and thermal lensing in the jet further add to the noise.

The  absorption  of  the  400  nm  light  in  water  is  extremely  non-uniform;  e.g.,  at  0.5-1

TW/cm2, 80-90% of the light is absorbed in a 10-20 µm thin layer near the surface. As a

consequence, the temperature of water in this layer instantly increases to 30-80 oC, 9  and

this  sudden  temperature  jump  further  destabilizes  the  TA  signal  since  the  absorption

spectrum of hydrated electron shifts to the red in hot water.  7 Although  ∆OD of 0.01-1

can be obtained for radiances just below the dielectric breakdown (at 10 TW/cm2), the

shot-to-shot variance of the TA is comparable to the TA signal itself.

Pump-probe kinetics of the hydrated electron in neat H2O were obtained in the 3-

photon regime using 0.15 TW/cm2,  400  nm  pump  pulses  of  200  fs  FWHM  (Fig. 3(a),

open  circles).  The  solid  line  in  Fig.  3(a)  indicates  FDSS  kinetics  from  the  same

photosystem under identical excitation conditions. For the compression factor  s = −2160,

the maximum time window is ca. 60 ps (τ

GVD of 0.9 ps) and the decay kinetics of  eaq

−

were quite flat (see Fig. 2(b)). The oscillation pattern near the kinetic origin is similar to

the one found for hydrated electron in the iodide photosystem; 3 perhaps, its characteristic

asymmetric profile also originates in the solvation dynamics of pre-thermalized electron

on the short time scale. 3  Fig. 3(b) shows FDSS kinetics obtained for a greater GVD of -

1.46 ps2 for three pump powers in the "3+1" region; the window is extended to 140 ps. As

∆OD  increases  from  0.017  to  0.2  to  0.4,  the  amplitude  of  the  oscillations  decreases.

7

Similar trends were observed for other photosystems studied (ref. 3): the interference of

quasimonochromatic  components  that  give  rise  to  the  oscillation  pattern  in  Fig.  3  is

weaker in the strongly absorbing samples.

Note that same "noise" level was observed in the FDSS kinetics before and after

the pump pulse (Fig. 3), suggesting that most of the "noise" was due to the unstable flow

of the sample rather than pump variation. We believe that most of the scatter in the FDSS

traces is caused by an unstable jet surface: Near the nozzle, the jet is a concave lens that

strongly refracts and disperses the probe light, and sinous and capillary waves and other

flow disturbances constantly modify the spectrum of the transmitted light. Though the

S/N  ratio  for  the  FDSS  kinetics  obtained  using  the  high-speed  jet  was  worse  than  the

same ratio obtained in ref. 3 for solid samples and liquid samples flowed in a glass cell,

the averaging time needed to achieve this S/N ratio was 10 times shorter for FDSS than

for the PPS experiment, under identical excitation conditions.

B. Thin-film amorphous Si:H alloy.

When the sample thickness d is comparable to the wavelength of the probe light,

the  sample  will  exhibit  well-resolved  interference  fringes.  As  a  result,  the  PPS

∆εω t( ) from the PPS kinetic traces one needs to (i) determine this factor in a separate

experiment, (ii) measure transient reflection of the sample in addition to the transmission,
and (iii) invert linear equations that express these two signals vs.  ∆ ′ ( )εω t  and  ∆ ′′( )εω t . 12,13

Involved as it is, this procedure (known as the "inversion method")  12 is insufficient to

obtain the real part of the dielectric function near the fringe extrema, where  Im τω = 0 .

On the other hand, precisely due to the latter condition,  ∆ ′′( )εω t  can be determined from a

single TA measurement near these fringe extrema, even if  ∆ ′ ( )εω t  is large, provided that

the fringe period in the frequency domain is much greater than the spectral width of the
p .  5,13   The retrieval of  ∆εω t( ) is further complicated by inhomogeneous

probe pulse,  1 τ

absorption of the pump that changes the inversion matrix. Moon and Tauc 12 found that

this method completely breaks down for large TA signals ( ∆T T > 0.01). Even when the

TA signal is weak, the results are very sensitive to small errors in τω, 12 which is seldom

known  with  the  required  accuracy  for  the  exact  spot  probed  with  the  laser  light  (e.g.,

compare traces (iii) in Figs. 5 and 6 given below for two spots on the same sample). As

shown below, FDSS is, in some ways, preferable to the inversion method. The advantage

of  FDSS  is  that  it  inherently  combines  spectral  and  kinetic  measurement  in  a  single

experiment whereas the inversion relies on several independent measurements.

In ref. 2 it was shown that for a flat sample of thickness d that uniformly absorbs

the pump light, the signal  S ω(

To  demonstrate  the  peculiarities  of  FDSS  for  thin  samples,  we  have  chosen

amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) which is a commercial thin-film material for

solar  energy  conversion.  5,11-19    This  material  has  an  optical  gap  of  1.75  eV  and  is

transparent at our probe wavelength, 800 nm. The dynamics of photoinduced free carriers

and trapped charges in a-Si:H has been extensively studied (see reviews in refs. 5, 11,

and 14). Upon short-pulse excitation with < 600 nm photons, free carriers are injected in

their respective bands. These carriers thermalize, 15,16,17   recombine with each other (with

rate  constant  of  2.3x10-8 cm3/s)  5,15,16,17 and  descend  into  shallow  (60-100  meV)  traps

(~1020  cm-3)  with  a  rate  constant  of  (1-2)x10-8  cm3/s.  5,18,19    The  scattering  time  of  the

plasma is very short,  ca. 0.5 fs, 11,14  and no TA signal from the free carriers was observed

in the visible and near infra-red for carrier density < 1019-1020 cm-3. 5,13,14,18,19    For initial

carrier densities of 1017-1018 cm-3, the TA signal is dominated by band-tail charges that

slowly  recombine  (with  a  rate  constant  of  6x10-9  cm3/s),  5  by  hopping  and  thermal

emission, and descend into < 1017 cm-3 of deep traps (such as dangling Si bonds). 5,11,12,18,19

The  intraband  absorption  of  these  trapped  charges  is  a  smooth,  featureless  curve  that

gradually ascends from the visible into the near infra-red. 18,19  At low carrier density, the
decay kinetics of  ∆ ′ ( )εω t   and  ∆ ′′( )εω t   are slow (lasting hundreds of ps) and dispersive.

5,11,12   ∆ ′ ( )εω t  is negative, and the initial phase (for t  <100 ps) is close to 107o (at 1033

nm). 18,19

11

Fig. 4 shows PPS kinetics obtained for 400 nm excitation of a d=1.3 µm thick

film of a-Si:H. At this excitation energy, the pump light is absorbed in 30 nm layer near

the surface, resulting in high initial density (>1019 cm-3) and considerable excess energy

(ca. 1.35 eV) of the photocarriers. The center frequency ω

0 of the probe pulse, 800 nm, is

matched  with  the  transmission  maximum  of  the  film  at  796  nm,  and  the  TA  signal  is

dominated by photoinduced absorbance from the free carriers and trapped charges. 5 The

short-lived "spike" (< 5 ps) near the kinetic origin has nearly the same decay profile as
the  (positive)  ∆ ′ ( )εω t   and  (negative)  ∆ ′′( )εω t   in  the  310  nm  pump  -  310  nm  probe

experiment by Wraback et al.  16  Similar PPS kinetics with a life time of 1.5 ps for the

spike  were  observed  in  a  400  nm  pump  -  2.86  µm  probe  experiment  at  Argonne

(unpublished).  Tauc  and  coworkers  11,16,17 give  an  estimate  of  2  eV/ps  for  the  rate  of

carrier  relaxation  in  a-Si:H,  which  gives  1.5  ps  for  thermalization  time  after  400  nm

photoexcitation. The decay rate of the "spike" changes with the pump intensity, and the

kinetics can be interpreted in terms of a monoexponential process with time constant of

ca.  2  ps  (that  Wraback  et  al.  16,17 associate  with  carrier  relaxation)  and  a  bimolecular

process with rate constant of 4x10-10  cm3/s (presumably, due to recombination of these

"hot" carriers). For t >5 ps, the PPS kinetics show slow decay over > 1 ns; with only a

few per cent drop in the photoinduced optical density  ∆OD over the first 50 ps after the

photoexcitation  pulse.  From  these  results,  it  may  be  expected  that  picosecond  FDSS

kinetics  would  be  flat.  Such  dispersive  TA  kinetics  are  very  typical  for  amorphous

semiconductors: one can always find a time window where these kinetics are nearly flat.

Thus, for a suitably long pump delay, the wavelength dependence of the coefficient T(ω)

can be determined as discussed above. For the thin-film system examined, this function

has been obtained at T=300 ps (Figs. 5 and 6, traces (iii)). Following other authors, we

assume  that  the  photoinduced  change  in  the  dielectric  function  is  constant  over  the

12

narrow spectral band of the probe pulse, 18,19  and the wavelength dependence of T(ω) is

due to the wavelength-dependent spectral function τω alone. 12

In Figs. 5 and 6(a), FDSS kinetics for the same sample are given at several delay

times T of the pump pulse and two compression factors, s=-630 (τ

) and s=-

). In Fig. 5(b), T=0 ps and T=9 ps kinetics S(ω) obtained for s=-630

(shown  in Fig. 5(a))  were  normalized  by  the  T=300  ps  kinetics  that  yield  the  spectral

response  function  T(ω).  These  normalized  kinetics  are  flat  after  the  first  few

picoseconds, suggesting that the normalization procedure succeeds in compensating for

the curved transmission profile. In trace (i) of Fig. 6(b), the oscillation patterns obtained

for  s = −630 at two delay times T of the pump are juxtaposed in the group delay time

(given in the units of  τ

GVD). In the frequency domain,  T=0 ps corresponds to the time

origin placed at the transmittance maximum whereas T=9 ps corresponds to this origin

placed  at  the  reflectance  maximum  (Fig.  5(b)).  Despite  a  considerable  change  in  the

phase of the complex factor  τω for these two positions (see below), the two oscillation

patterns are almost exactly the same. The same applies to the kinetic traces obtained for a

greater compression factor (Fig. 6). This result is counterintuitive because, as explained

above, in general the oscillation pattern exhibited by FDSS kinetics depends strongly on

the  interference  of  quasimonochromatic  components,  and  this  interference  may  be

expected  to  change  as  the  kinetic  origin  is  scanned  across  the  fringe  pattern.  This  is

certainly the case for very thin samples, for which the band width of the probe pulse is

much smaller than the fringe period.

Below we demonstrate that the general theory of FDSS spectroscopy given in ref.

2  and  eq.  (3)  derived  therein  account  well  for  these  observations.  Fig.  7  shows  the

function T(ω) calculated using Fresnel coefficients given by eqs. (A7) and (A8) in ref. 2

13

for  d=1.27  µm  and  φε=00  and  900  (the  refraction  indexes  for  the  film  and  the  glass

substrate  are  taken  from  ref.  14).  This  function has  a  maximum  exactly  at  the  center

frequency ω

0 of the probe pulse, and the fringe period is close to the FWHM of this pulse.

The calculation indicates that the phase of the complex factor τω in eq. (2) changes from

90o at the spectral center (where the transmission is minimum) to ±65o at the limits of the

optimum spectral range (where the reflection is maximum/minimum).

Fig. 7 exhibits FDSS  kinetics obtained by numerical solution of eq. (3) for T=0

(kinetic origin at the transmission minimum), T=35  ps  (kinetic  origin  at  the  reflection

maximum), and T=20 ps for a photoabsorption signal (φε=90o) that exponentially decays

with life time of 40 ps. Although these simulated FDSS kinetics change considerably as a

function of T, most of this change is in the weighting factor  τω. In Fig. 8(a), normalized

signals  S(

 are plotted; these normalized kinetics change very slightly for these

three delay times. In Fig. 8(b),  S(

 kinetics are plotted as a function of Te shifted

by  T. The latter shift is introduced in order to juxtapose the corresponding oscillation

patterns. It is seen that the changes in the positions of crests are small, ca. 20-30% of

what would be expected from eq. (3) in which one lets  Θ Ω

(

) ≈ τ εω
∆

ω, as can be done in

the thin-film limit (for  k dω << 1). E. g., for T=20 ps and 35 ps the spacing between the

first pair of the oscillation crests is just 4.5% and 9.1% lower, respectively, than the same

spacing for T=0 ps. This result is in full agreement with the experimental observations

discussed above. Qualitatively, since the quasimonochromatic components of the chirped

probe  pulse  cover  the  entire  spectral  range  of  the  fringe,  the  phase  shifts  acquired  by

these  components  due  to  their  interference  in  the  sample  cancel  each  other  almost

perfectly.  In  this  sense,  the  resulting  FDSS  kinetics  is  much  like  the  PPS  kinetics,  in

which the change in the transmission of the probe light is averaged over the entire band

of  the  probe  pulse.  The  advantage  of  FDSS  is  that  the  spectral  information  needed  to

14

retrieve  ∆εω  is  obtained  simultaneously  with  these  TA  kinetics,  in  the  same

measurement.

We conclude that for thin-film samples that exhibit closely spaced interference

fringes meaningful "TA kinetics" can be obtained from the FDSS traces by carrying out

the  S(

 normalization. Like the corresponding PPS traces, these "TA kinetics"

are  a  combination  of  transient  absorption  and  reflection  signals.  Unlike  PPS,  FDSS

simultaneously yields the spectral function  T (

)ω  needed to obtain phase relations that

are required for the kinetic analysis.

IV. CONCLUSION.

Two photosystems were studied using FDSS in which the probe light was chirped

using a variable length grating compressor. For these photosystems, FDSS yielded a S/N

ratio  superior  to  that  of  PPS  over  a  shorter  acquisition  time.  The  sampling  time  was

reduced  due  to  the  "single-shot"  nature  of  the  method  and  elimination  of  mechanical

movement  of  the  translation  stage.  The  most  dramatic  reduction  was  for  multiphoton

excitation (Sec. III.A) since the amplitude variations were the strongest. TA kinetics for

3-to-4 photon ionization of water were obtained. The S/N ratio for these FDSS kinetics

exceeded this ratio for PPS kinetics collected over 10 times longer acquisition time.

In Sec. III.B, we illustrated the use of FDSS for a thin-film sample that exhibited

well resolved interference fringes whose spacing was similar to the spectral width of the

probe  pulse  –  an  especially  complex  case  for  PPS  9  and  "single-shot"  spectroscopies

based upon spatial encoding 20 or chirped-pulse interferometry. 20

We conclude that the FDSS technique is widely applicable, versatile, and easy to

implement experimentally. The frequency domain spectrometer can be built side-by-side

with  a  pump-probe  spectrometer  in  a  single  setup  (Sec.  II).  The  requirements  for  the

15

compressor can be met with the standard equipment used for chirped-pulse amplification.

The method does not require tight control over the profile of the probe and pump beam,

as is the case with "single-shot" methods based on spatial encoding. 21

−  yield in 400 nm photoionization of neat liquid

water in a 160 µm thick jet observed via the PPS-detected electron absorbance at 800 nm,

ca.  16  ps  after  the  200  fs  FWHM  excitation  pulse  (at  which  time  the  electron

thermalization  is  complete).  The  pump  and  probe  beam  radii  were  56  and  14  µm,

respectively. At low irradiance (< 0.5 TW/cm2), the ionization is 3-photon and results in

the  geminate  decay  kinetics  for  which  the  escape  yield  of  the  electron  is  ca.  72%.  At

higher irradiance, the electron yield linearly increases with the pump power, indicating

the occurrence of the "3+1" excitation process. Simultaneously, the time profile of the

kinetics changes so that the escape yield approaches > 90%. (b) TA kinetics obtained in

the  "3+1"  regime  (for  80  µJ  pump  pulse).  The  decay  is  second  order  (solid  line)  and

originates  mainly  through  the  cross-recombination  of  the  electrons  and  OH  radicals

generated by the ionization of water (that occurs with a rate constant of 3x1010 M-1 s-1).

The path-average concentration of the electrons is 1.6 mM, which gives a time constant

of  21  ns;  the  observed  time  constant  is  higher,  ca.  5  ns,  due  to  the  extremely  non-

homogeneous excitation profile for the "3+1" photoprocess.

GVD=0.9 ps (1 ps = 6.5 cm-1). An arrow

indicates the "spike" in the oscillation pattern near the kinetics origin that is analogous to

the same "spike" in the FDSS kinetics obtained for biphotonic detachment of the electron

from  aqueous  iodide  (ref.  3).  (b)  Power  dependence  for  normalized  FDSS  kinetics

obtained under the same "3+1" excitation conditions as the PPS kinetics shown in Fig. 2.

The pump power and the maximum ∆OD  were (i) 27 µJ and 0.017, (ii) 49 µJ and 0.2,

and  (iii)  94  µJ  and  0.394,  respectively.  Note  the  drastic  reduction  in  the  oscillation

amplitude at the higher optical density. The FDSS kinetics were obtained for τ

GVD=1.2 ps

(1 ps = 3.6 cm-1) with a 33 fs FWHM (seed) probe pulse. Traces (i), (ii), and (iii) are the

averages of 30, 45, and 100 thousands shots, respectively.

Pump-probe kinetics observed upon the 400 nm excitation of 1.3 µm film of amorphous

hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) on a suprasil substrate (801.3 nm probe). The pump power

was (i) 9 and (ii) 43 µJ. After the initial rapid decay on the picosecond time scale due to

carrier  relaxation;  a  slower  decay  on  sub-nanosecond  time  scale  is  due  to  the

recombination of trapped charges in the bulk. The 33 fs FWHM probe pulse is centered at

the transmission extremum (see Fig. 5) and has a band pass similar to the fringe spacing.

Note the flatness of the decay kinetics for t >10 ps at the lower excitation power.

The neutral vector meson resonances, φ, J/ψ, Bs* and Υ, and the tau

lepton  occupy  consecutive  mass  levels  in  a  geometric  series  which

also  includes  the  muon  and  the  neutral  vector  boson,  Z,  in  a

symmetric  arrangement.  The  mass  of  the  tau  lepton  is  equal  to  the

geometric mean of the φ and J/ψ masses.

A  geometric  sequence  of  neutral  vector  boson  and  charged  lepton  masses  has  been  identified

(Figure 1). In this paper, an attempt is made to put that discovery into the context of the model

from which it arose.

The quark mass evaluations of the Particle Data Group [1] have been shown [2] to be consistent

with the values of ‘mass levels’ which descend from the Planck Mass (1.2210 ± 0.0009 x1019 GeV),

Pm ,  in  a  geometric  series  of  common  ratio  2/π.  The  mass  of  the  nth  level  in  the  spectrum  is

defined as

Also in [2], hadrons were shown to occupy ‘higher order’ mass levels, of fractional (half-integer,

quarter-integer, eighth-integer, etc) n. Doublet states were found to lie either side of mass levels.

‘Mass partnerships’ occur between particles of, normally, equal strangeness but different I, I3 or J.

The  mass  difference  characteristic  of  the  partnership  is  approximately  equal  to  the  mass  of  a

principal  (integer  n)  or  low  order  level.  In  several  partnerships  involving  strange  hadrons  (Λ-Σ0,

Σ+-Σ-, Σ0-Σ(1385)0, K*-Σ0 and φ-Ξ), the mass difference is equal, within the small uncertainty, to

the mass of a principal level. The muon and tau lepton were proposed as the mass partners of the

π  pseudoscalar  meson  doublet  and  the  Ds

±  pseudoscalar  meson,  respectively.  The  electron  was

proposed  as  the  mass  partner  of  the  K  pseudoscalar  meson  doublet  but  displaced  in  mass  from

within the main sequence of particles, which extends in mass from 

µm  to 

Zm .

The mass of the electron is related to the mass of the K* vector meson doublet interstitial level

(893.80 MeV), and is given by

which has the value 0.51100 ± 0.00036 MeV. The measured value is 0.510998902 ± 0.000000021

MeV [3].

A second, bottom-up, geometric mass series is now constructed, ascending from the muon mass

with common ratio π/2. The mass of the n′th level in the spectrum is defined as

The main sequence of particles spans 15 principal (integer n′) level intervals, as shown in Figure

1. The neutral vector meson resonances with hidden flavour, φ ( ss ), J/ψ ( cc ), Bs

* ( bs

) and Υ

( bb ), the neutral vector boson, Z, and the tau lepton occupy principal and higher order n′ levels

in an arresting pattern. Values of n′ for the vector boson masses [3] do not coincide exactly with

n′ levels because these particles are constrained to occupy the mass levels described by (1) [2].

The charged Ds*± vector meson resonance does not occupy a low order level in the n′ sequence.

The tau lepton, though, occupies the level with n′=6¼.

As a consequence of their level occupation, the muon and the tau lepton are related in mass by

Using Particle Data Group mass values [3], the left hand side of (4) is equal to 16.818 ± 0.003;

the right hand side of (4) has the value 16.817. The tau lepton, of mass

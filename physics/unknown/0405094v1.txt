The lepton mass ratios are calculated using a geometric unified theory, taking the leptons as the only
three possible families of topological excitations of the electron or the neutrino. The theoretical results
give 107.5916 Mev for the muon mass using mµ/me and 1770.3 Mev for the tau mass using mτ/mµ. Using
the additional geometric interaction energy in a muon-neutrino system, the main leptonic mass contribu-
tion  to  the  pion  and  kaon  mass  is  calculated  to  be,  respectively,  140.88  Mev  and  494.76  Mev.  The
necessary first order corrections, due to the interaction of the excitations, should be of the order of the
discrepancies  with  experimental  values.  The  three  geometric  families  of  leptonic  excitations  may  be
related to a quark structure.

1. Introduction.

We  have  presented  a  definition  of  mass  [1 ],  within  a  geometric  relativistic  unified  theory  of  gravitation  and  other
interactions [2 ], in terms of the concept of self energy of the non linear self interaction in a geometric space. This deter-
mines the particle mass in Dirac’s equation as a representation of the structure group. The microscopic physical objects
(geometric particles) are realized as linear geometric excitations, geometrically described in a jet bundle formalism shown
to lead to the standard quantum field theory techniques. These geometric excitations are essentially perturbations around a
non-linear geometric background space solution, where the excitations may be considered to evolve with time. The back-
ground space carries the universal inertial properties which should be consistent with the ideas of Mach [3] and Einstein [4 ]
that assign fundamental importance of far-away matter in determining the inertial properties of local matter including the
inertial mass.

The geometry is related to a connection Γ in a principal fiber bundle (E,M,G) and matter is related to a current J of
geometrical objects. The structure group G is SL(4,R) and the even subgroup G+ is SL1(2,C). The subgroup L (Lorentz) is
the subgroup of  G+ with real determinant, in other words, SL(2,C). There is only another subgroup P in the possible group
chains  G⊃H⊃L, which is Sp(4,R). The two coset G/G+ y P/L determine symmetric spaces that we shall denote respec-
tively by K and C. These groups have a principal fiber bundle structure over the cosets, indicated as  (G,K,G+) and (P,C,L).
The induced representations are carried by a space D, which is an associated bundle to G with Lorentz group representa-
tions D[L] as fiber. The energy density of induced representations over the symmetric spaces is expressed by the product
⊂K
J*Γ. The  masses are obtained integrating over the symmetric coset subspaces of relativistically inequivalent points KR
for the group G and CR

Due to the existence a constant non-linear background solution, called the substratum, the quotient of the masses for
these geometric G-excitations and P-excitations around the substratum may be expressed in terms of volumes associated to
these spaces and have the exact finite value (see appendix 6.4),

which is a good approximation for the quotient of the experimental physical values for the proton and electron masses. The
geometric expression for this mass quotient was known [5, 6 ,7 ], but not physically explained.

Now  we  present  the  application  of  these  ideas  to  the  calculation  of  the  masses  of  topological  excitations  that  may

represent heavy leptons. Preliminay partial results were presented at the III LASSF (III Congreso Ven. de Física) [8].

2. Families of Scattering Solutions.

Now consider only topological properties, independent of the connection, of the space of complete solutions (substra-
tum plus excitation solutions). An incoming scattering solution is a jet bundle local section, over a world tube in the space
time base manifold, that describes the evolution of the solution in terms a time like parameter τ from past infinity to some
finite time t. Similarly, an outgoing solution is a local section from time t to future infinity. The local sections in the bundle
represent classes of solutions relative to local observers. Scattering solutions at infinity are asymptotically free excitation
solutions around a substratum. The substrata (incoming and outgoing) are equivalent to each other and to the constant
substratum solution if we choose observer frames adapted to the substrata.

. We require that all incoming solutions, at the past infinity hypersurface I-

Since the equations are of hyperbolic type, we should provide initial conditions on an initial tridimensional hypersur-
, reduce to a free excitation
face at past infinity I-
(∞). Since the incoming solution substrata
around the substratum solution at the bidimensional spatial infinity subspace I-
(∞), we may treat this spatial infinity as a single point, thus
are equivalent to the substratum solution at spatial infinity I-
 is homeomorphic to S3. All incoming solutions
realizing a single point compactification of I-
 are classified by the functions over S3. The same requirements may be applied to the outgoing remote future solutions
on I-
and, in fact, to any solution I along an intermediate tridimensional hypersurface, a section of the world tube. Thus, the final
 is also homeomorphic to S3. The incoming and outgoing substratum local sections over I-
hypersurface at future infinity I+
 must be pasted together in some common region I×R around the present t, by the transition functions of the bundle.
and I+
The scattering interaction is represented by the group action of the transition functions at τ=0.  All generators of the group
produce a transformation to a different, but equivalent under the group, expression for the solution. If the holonomy group
of the solution is not the whole group, there is a reference frame that reduces the structure group to the particular  holonomy

subgroup. But in general for arbitrary observers, there are solutions formally generated by SL(2,Q)=SL(4,R). Since this
transition region, the “compactified equator”×R, has the topology of S3×R, the transition functions ϕ define a mapping, at
the τ=0 hypersurface,

which is classified by the third homotopy group [9 ] of the structure group SL(4,R) or the respective holonomy subgroup.
There are some solutions not deformable to the trivial solution by a homeomorphism because ϕ represents the twisting of
local pieces of the bundle when glued together.

These scattering solutions are characterized by integer topological numbers related to the maximal compact
subgroup,  known as winding or wrapping numbers. In all cases the scattering solutions are characterized by a topologi-
cal number n and in particular the scattering solutions of G-excitations have an additional topological number n’. This
result implies that there are solutions Γ

0, J0.

3. Geometric Excitation Masses

The integrand  J*Γ, which corresponds to a fundamental representation, is a local substratum constant equal for all
values of n. The number of possible states of a fundamental representation only depends on the integration volume. For P-
excitations, when integrating over the CR subspace of De Sitter space C, corresponding to inequivalent observer states by an
L transformation, we have counted the number of L equivalence classes of states (points in the mass hyperboloid are in the
same relativistic equivalence class as the rest state of the representation) in local form (only counting n=0 local states).
Taking in consideration the global characteristics of the topological excitation that would represent heavy leptons, the
count should be larger, over all L equivalence classes of excitation states with wrapping n. What is the number states for
each value of n?

Since we are working with a manifold with atlas, the integration equation (1) over the symmetric space K is realized en
the atlas charts. On the principal fiber bundle (E,M,G), the transition function preserves the projection and acts, as a group
element, over the fiber which is the bundle structure group G (see appendix 6.1). For two neighborhoods U, V in the base
manifold M, which corresponds to space-time, we have the following maps: homeomorphisms h from the bundle to the
model space, transition functions ϕ  among the charts and partial identity i over the points mcM,

The transition function ϕ acts as an element of G over the incoming scattering solution, defined on a hypersurface
homeomorphic to S3, to produce the outgoing scattering solution. Physically  ϕ  represents  a  collision  interaction.  The
active representation is the interaction of two excitations observed by a single observer. The passive representation is the
observation of a single excitation by different observers. The non trivial transition functions of class [ϕ
n], where the index
n represents the set of wrapping numbers (n, n’), are classified by the mappings (see appendix 6.2)

Consider G as a principal fiber bundle (G,K,G+). The induced representations, assigned to points mcM, are sections of an
associated  bundle  to  G  that  has  Lorentz  group  representations  D[L]  as  fiber  and  is  denoted  by  (D,K,D[L],L).  Under  a
change of charts, representing a change of observers, the transition function acts on the bundle D, on the integrand in
equation (1), a section J*Γ  over K, which we shall indicate by f(m).

The transition functions belong to the different classes determined by the third homotopy group of G (see appendix

the generating classes ϕ is globally associated to a generating wrapped subspace s in (G,K,G+), additional and necessary,
linked to the original trivial subspace by a transition function. In this manner the class [ϕ

The excitation is not completely described by a single subspace that would correspond to a single observer s(m) in the
passive representation. For global reasons we must accept the presence of as many images of generating subspaces in the
non trivial chart as there are wrappings. Nevertheless some of the wrappings may be equivalent under the subgroup of
interest. For the trivial subbundle G there is only one independent wrapping, the trivial (n=0) wrapping s0, because the
subspaces sn are equivalent under a G transformation. For other subbundles, a tridimensional su(2) subalgebra acts on the
complete group G fiber bundle, generating transformations of P and L subbundles which  are not equivalent under the
corresponding subgroup. It is possible to generate no more than three wrappings si(m) in geometrically independent Pi, Li
subbundles in G. In other words any other wrapping may be obtained by some combination of three transformations in G.
For this reason  the number of independent wrappings si in P or L bundles is n[2 and determines three families of excita-
tions.

The Lorentz representations fi(sic) may be independent of any other  fa(sac). Therefore, the physically possible states of a
wrapped excitation of class [ϕ
n] correspond 1 to 1 to all L equivalence classes of states determined in each one of these n+1
µ relative to corre-
section images fi. Using the passive representation, on each image there are momentum coordinates ki
sponding  local  observers  i,  states  physically  independent  among  themselves.  The  integration  should  be  done  over  all

As we indicated (see appendix 6.4) the integrand J*Γ, corresponding to a fundamental representation, is a local constant
equal for all values of n. The bare masses are determined by the volume of integration. Let us denote the integration space
that supports fi(m) by C*, equal to product of n+1 copies of the original CR space, corresponding to the n+1  observed
wrappings

For the trivial case (n=0) the calculation is strictly local, it is not necessary to consider wrapped charts and the integra-

tion over CR may be done locally on any chart of the trivial class. The subspace s0 is determined by a local observer.

For wrapped states (ng0) we are forced to use the non trivial transition functions [ϕ

n], with non zero wrapping n (ng0),
that  relates a wrapped chart of class [n] with the trivial chart. Therefore it is necessary to consider simultaneously (glo-
bally) these pairs of chart classes associated to the incoming and outgoing scattering solutions respectively. Physically it is
necessary to consider all L-equivalence classes of possible states in accordance with observers related to non trivial charts
obtained  from  the  trivial  chart.  Therefore,  for  the  class  [ng0]  it  is  necessary  to  integrate  over  all  possible  charts  with

“globally wrapped” sections, produced by the action of transition functions. In this case the transition functions may be any
element of the group P. We restrict the integration to those non trivial charts that are inequivalent under a relativity trans-
formation L and the number of possible charts corresponds to the volume of the P/L subspace CR of L-equivalence classes.

The linear topological excitations are generated by the linear infinitesimal action of the differential ϕ

function ϕ that represents the τ=0 interaction. When restricting the transition functions to elements of the subgroup P,

we  should  only  consider  the  effect  of  the  differential  mapping  ϕ
*.  The  odd  subspace  in  the  P  algebra,  as  differential
mapping, generates the coset C. The only generator inequivalent to an L “boost” is the compact u(1) generator. The differ-
ential action produces a smaller space of L-equivalence classes. If we denote the compact subgroup U(1) 1 SU(2) of P by
H we obtain the non compact coset BqC

The group P may be expressed as a principal fiber bundle (P,B,H) over B. If we inject L in P the image of the rotation
subgroup in L should be the SU(2) subgroup in H but the image of the “boost” sector in L is not uniquely defined in B. The
group L acts on P preserving its image in P. The u(1) subalgebra of H acts on B, as a translation within P, mapping the C
subspace onto another subspace C’ in B which is P-equivalent to C. Nevertheless C´ is not L-equivalent to C. Therefore, the
possible  L-inequivalent  states  correspond  to  the  translation  action  by  the  U(1)  compact  subgroup  not  related  with  the
rotation SU(2). The number of L-equivalence classes of these possible charts, over which we should integrate, is deter-
mined by the volume of this electromagnetic U(1) group. The total wrapped space CT for an n-excitation (ng0) is the space
formed by all possible translated C* spaces, not relativistically equivalent

The number of states (different k values) is proportional to the volume of this total CT space, which may be calculated,

corresponding to the bare masses of the µµµµµ     and τ τ τ τ τ leptons. Due to the electron-muon U(1) electromagnetic interaction in the
topological excitation, we should apply a first order energy correction to m1. For the subbundle L we can make a similar
calculation. The bare masses of the associated neutrinos for the 3 families are zero because the volume of the L/L coset
space is zero. We shall refer to these topological excitations, respectively, as TnP-excitations and TnL-excitations.

The chart transformations under general G transition functions translate, within G, the CR region of integration. The
only possible additional L-inequivalent states correspond to the action of compact sectors in the group. In order to find the
different possibilities we consider the two related chains of symmetric spaces in G, not related to L

The compact symmetric subspaces CR and KR, respectively, contain one and two U(1) electromagnetic subgroups of the
three  equivalent  U(1)  subgroups  contained  in  the  electromagnetic  SU(2).  We  note  that  one  U(1)  is  common  to  both
subspaces. We are interested in extending the translation within G, beyond the U(1) transition function, by adjoining
compact sectors. The physical interpretation is that these excitations are subjected to additional nonlinear interactions that
increase the energy and therefore their masses. In the same manner as an observable relativistic motion increases the rest
mass to a kinetic mass, an observable relativistic interaction increases the free mass to a dynamic mass. This relativistic
effect, included in the mass definition, is realized by the action of the transition functions at τ=0.

For ng0 topological excitations the transition functions may be extended from U(1) to CR. The physical interpretation
is that these topological excitations are subjected to the additional electroweak interactions of a leptonic P-system. We say
that the excitations are “masked” by the nonlinear electroweak interactions. The geometric mass expressions for the class
[ng0] masked excitations should be multiplied by the volume of the corresponding complete subspace of L-equivalent
classes V(CR) rather than by its V(U(1)) subspace. The weak interaction energy acquired by the n-excitations corresponds
to the product of the values from equations (23) and (24) by the ratio of the volumes

If we use experimental values for the lepton masses, we obtain the masked geometric masses,

We  shall  refer  to  these  CR  masked  (electroweakly  interacting)  topological  excitations  as  TnPC-excitations.  The  TnPC-
excitations may be considered components of mesons. In particular, a masked muon µ’ or T1PC -excitation, joined to a low
energy T1L-excitation, has the geometric mass and other properties of the pion π.

For ng0 topological excitations the transition functions may be further extended beyond CR to include the sector of KR
corresponding to both U(1) subgroups in KR which is an SU(2)/U(1) compact sector that may be identified with the sphere
S2.  The  physical  interpretation  is  that  these  excitations  are  subjected  to  additional  strong  nonlinear  interactions  of  a
hadronic G-system. The parametrization of group spaces and their symmetric cosets is, to a certain extent, arbitrary. They
map different points in the linear Lie algebra to the same group operation. Since both equivalent U(1) subgroups in S2
have the same significance because of the symmetry of S2, they both should contribute equally to the invariant volume of
S2 and it is convenient to choose a parametrization that explicitly displays this fact. A parametrization that accomplishes
this is

These excitations are not contained in the P sector defined by the n=0 wrapping, but rather in a combination of inequivalent
P sectors inside G. Therefore, strictly, they do not have a proper constituent topological P-excitation. We shall refer to
these Σ masked (strongly interacting) topological excitations as TnPΣ-excitations. In particular, a masked muon µ” or T1PΣ-
excitation, joined to a low energy T1L-excitation, has the geometric mass and other properties of the kaon K.

The physical interpretation of these masked leptons suggests that the corresponding geometric excitations may
be combined to form lepton pairs that may be considered particles. In accordance with this interpretation, the com-
binations under nuclear interactions are only possible if there is, at least, one masked lepton. Take the n=1 topologi-
cal leptons and construct a doublet l of a cSU(2) combinatory group associating a masked muon and a stable lepton.
We should indicate that the conjugation in the Clifford algebra, which is equivalent to the dual operation in sp(4,R),
is not the dual operation in csu(2). Both l and its conjugate are csu(2) fundamental representations 2. The product is

The first possibility is that µ is a weakly masked µ’, part of the SU(2) leptonic system doublet (µ’, ν) character-

The only other possibility is the more complex combination where the muon is a strongly masked µ”. In addition
to the coupling to ν, since µ” shows a strong S2 electromagnetic interaction, µ” also couples strongly to the electron
e, forming two related SU(2) hadronic systems. We may substitute ν by e as the leptonic doublet partner. We get the

The  masses  of  these  π  and  Κ  geometric  particles  equal  the  masses  of  ground  states  belonging  to  the  product
representation of these representations. Their geometrical masses, essentially determined by the mass of its princi-
pal component or masked heavy lepton as indicated in equations (27) and (32), approximately correspond to the
masses of all physical pions and kaons. We may also define

These  results  suggest  a  higher  approximate  symmetry  for  the  πΚ  combination,  that  may  be  contained  in  the
pseudoscalar  meson  representation.  In  other  words,  these  mesons  may  be  considered  lepton-antilepton  pairs,  as
suggested by Barut [11].

In addition to the proper topological P-excitations just discussed, we may consider subexcitations inside G. For [n=0]
P-subexcitations, considered in G, there is a set of C subspaces that correspond to the infinite ways of choosing P_G, not
to the unique C defined for an electron P_P. These additional C spaces are not P-equivalent and must be included in the
integration. For a triple electromagnetic interaction there are as many C spaces as U(1) subgroups inside SU(2), in other
words, as points on the sphere SU(2)/U(1). The volume of integration should be multiplied by 4π. The same thing happens
with L-excitations. In other words, class [n=0] leptonic subexcitation masses m0, when present in a hadronic G-system, are
masked by the nonlinear strong interactions. We shall refer to these S2 masked (strongly interacting) excitations as GS-
subexcitations. The GS-subexcitations geometric mass values corresponding to the fundamental leptonic excitations are 4π
times the previous leptonic geometric mass values,

The masked excitations are characterized by the same quantum numbers that characterize the leptonic excitation but
the value of the masked geometric mass includes the energy increase due to the other interactions. If the masked excita-
tions were to be ejected (injected) from (to) a G-system they would loose (gain) the energy due to the extra interactions,
and they would exit (enter) with the bare geometric mass value, as standard free leptons. There are no observable free
particles with the masked masses. Experimentally the masked mass would never be detected by long-range methods.
These masked leptonic subexcitations behave as quarks.

In  particular,  the  GS-subexcitations  correspond,  one  to  one,  to  the  leptons.  These  GS-subexcitations  determine  a
hexadimensional space. Consequently any other possible geometric GS-subexcitation can be expressed as a linear super-
position of these fundamental masked geometric subexcitations. Alternately we may interpret some of these subexcitations
as quark states. The structure of masked leptonic subexcitations is geometrically equivalent to the physical quark struc-
ture. For example, a superposition of 2 low velocity masked electrons e plus 1 masked low energy neutrino ν
e has a 2/3
charge and a total 4.2 Mev invariant mass and may be interpreted as a u quark. Similarly a superposition of 2 masked low
velocity muons µ plus 1 masked low energy neutrino νµ has 2/3 charge and 1.2 Gev total mass. It should be noted that, if
free quarks are unobservable, all experimental information about their masses comes from bound quark states (meson
resonances)  and  must  depend  somehow  on  theoretical  arguments  about  these  states.  There  is  no  quark  confinement
problem.

5. Conclusion.

The quotient for the geometric masses corresponding to P-excitations, due to the non linear substrate solution, includ-
ing algebraic and topologic effects are approximately equal to the quotient of the bare masses of all known leptons.  The
necessary first order corrections, due to the interaction of the excitations, should be of order α, equal to the order of the
discrepancies.

The pion, kaon and other mesons may be considered as systems of two masked leptons. The mass of the pseudoscalar
mesons may be explained as the mass of the ground states of the product representation of two masked fundamental
lepton representations. The geometry determines the mass spectrum of geometric excitation ground states, which for low
masses, essentially agrees with the physical particle mass spectrum. Quarks may be interpreted, in principle, as masked
geometrical leptonic P or L subexcitations.

6.1 Fiber Bundle

Essentially a fiber bundle is a projected space which localy is a product space. Define a fiber bundle in the following

manner [12 ]. Consider
: →
p E
M
an object of S(Top), the arrow category of topological spaces (category formed by all morphisms of the category Top as
objects and commutative diagrams as morphisms). If the mapping p is surjective it is a projection, E is the total space, M is
the base space and the triple is a projected space. If m ∈ M

p m E

m

The projected space is called a sheaf if the projection is a local homeomorphism. Each point e of E has an open neighbor-
hood homeomorphic to an open neighborhood of p(e).

Define a pseudocategory B(M,F) taking as objects the products U×F, where U are the open subsets of M and F is a

topological space, and as morphisms preserving the projection over U,
α × → ×

:U F V F

pr
V

!

α =

id pr          
U

!

∩ ≠ ∅

U V

  .

A fiber bundle is the manifold formed by a projected space E over M  with an atlas valued in B(M,F) compatible with the
projection p. If the transition functions of the atlas form a group we obtain a fiber bundle with structure group G. If the fiber
coincides with the structure group we have a principal fiber bundle (E,M,G)

6.2

Homotopic Product

There are topological excitations characterized by an integer number associated to the homotopy of group spaces, that
we  shall  call  winding,  or  more  appropriately,  wrapping  numbers  n  for  the  different  homotopy  groups.  For  a  complete
treatment of this subject see references [13 ,14].

6.3 Third Homotopy Group

In particular we are interested in the third homotopy group of group spaces. To determine π

3(G), we recognize that the
exponential mapping from the maximal non compact subalgebra of sl(4,R) is a diffeomorfism [15] onto the coset, a non
compact Riemannian subspace which is contractile. We have an exact short sequence in the general homotopy sequence

6.4 Volumes.

There is a constant solution [17 ] for the differential equations that determine the substratum connection. This local
solution may generate global scattering solutions with different topology in accordance with the third homotopy group of
the transition functions of the manifold. The excitations, although locally defined around a local trivial section (solution),
are related by transition functions to associated global topological solutions, characterized by an integer number called
wrapping number n.

The integrand J*Γ is a local constant, equal for all n values. The integration is on a subspace KR

⊂K of relativistically
⊂C⊂K for a subgroup H.  When integrating over local trivial

inequivalent points of K for the group G, and on a subspace CR
states n=0, the expressions for the masses are [17],

The volumes of the three cosets (K, C, I ) determined by the chain G⊃H⊃L were previously calculated [17, 18].  It is
necessary to eliminate the equivalent states dividing by the equivalence relation R under SO(3,1) boosts. Equivalent points
are related by a Lorentz boost transformation of magnitude β. There are as many equivalent points as the volume of the
orbit R developed by parameter β. The respective inequivalent volumes are,

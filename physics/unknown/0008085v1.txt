Abstract

Spallation  sources  dedicated 

to  neutron  scattering
experiments,  as  well  as  multi-purpose  facilities  serving
several applications  call  for  pulsed  mode  operation  of  a
high intensity proton linac. There is general  agreement on
the  superconducting technology for the  high-energy  part,
which  offers  some  advantages, 
like  higher  gradient
capabilities or operational costs reduction, as  compared to
room-temperatures  accelerating  structures.  This  mode  of
operation however could spoil  the  energy stability  of  the
proton beam and needs thus  to  be carefully studied. First,
transient  beam-loading  effects,  arising  from  the  large
beam  phase  slippage  along  a  multi-cell  cavity  and
associated  with  the  finite  RF  energy  propagation,  can
induce  significant  energy  modulation  with  a  too  small
cell-to-cell  coupling  or  a  too  large  number  of  cells.
Second,  due  to  beam  phase  slippage  effects  along  the
linac, energy spread exhibits  a larger sensitivity  to  cavity
fields fluctuations  than  relativistic  particles.  A  computer
code,  initially  developed  for  electron  beams  has  been
extended  to  proton  beams.  It  solves  the  6xN  coupled
differential equations, needed to  describe cavity  fields  and
beam-cavity  interactions  of  an  ensemble  of  N  cavities
driven by  one single  power source. Simulation  examples
on  a typical  pulsed  proton  linac  are  given  with  various
error  sources, 
like  Lorentz  forces  or  microphonics
detuning, input energy offsets, intensity jitters, etc...

1  INTRODUCTION

With the aim of studying the energy stability  in  a high
intensity  pulsed  superconducting  proton  linac,  which
could  be  spoiled  by  transient  beam  loading  and  beam
phase slippage effects,  we  used  the  two  computer  codes
MULTICELL  and  PSTAB.  The  former[1],  based  on  a
multi-mode  analysis,  calculates  the  systematic  energy
modulation generated within a multi-cell cavity due to  the
finite speed of the rf wave propagation; the latter,  initially
developed  for  relativistic  beams[2]  has  been  extended  to
low  beta  beams  and  can  handle  all  major  field  error
sources  (Lorentz  forces,  microphonics, 
input  energy
offsets,  beam charge jitter,  multiple  cavities  driven  by  a
single  power source,  etc)  including  feedback  system  and
extra power calculation. Due to  lack of  space, this  paper
is a shortened version of  a longer report[7] and presents a
few results of simulation for the  case of  a typical  neutron
spallation source, like ESS[3]. The  relevant parameters of
the  SC  High  Energy Linac,  which have been  chosen  for
this study are shown in Table 1.

The bunch frequency during beam-on time  is  assumed,
after  funnelling  of  two  beams  emerging  of  352.2  MHz

RFQs,  to  be equal to  the  704.4  MHz rf frequency of  the
SC  cavities.  Three  different  cavity  types  have  been
selected from input  to  exit  of  the  linac  and  their  energy
gains as a  function of  the  incoming  energy are plotted in
Fig.1 (synchronous phase of -30° included).

The operating accelerating fields G (net energy gain of a
particle of  constant speed equal to  the  geometric  beta  of
the cell divided by the iris-to-iris cavity length) correspond
to  electric and  magnetic  peak  surface  fields  of  about  27
MV/m  and  50  mT.  The  main  characteristics  of  the  3
sectors  are  shown  in  Table  2.  Longitudinal  beam
matching  between sectors is  controlled  by  adjustment  of
the synchronous phases of the  two  interface cryomodules.
The resulting  zero current phase  advance  per  unit  length
ranges from about  20° to  4°. The beam power per cavity
ranges from 130  kW at  the  beginning  to  680  kW  at  the
end of the linac for the mean beam current of 64.2 mA.

Figure 2: Energy gain and phase slippage along the

b =0.50 cavity (G = 8.5 MV/m, Ein = 85 MeV, f b = -30°).
This large phase slippage leads to different energy gains
and then  beam induced voltages between the  cells  of  the
cavity.  As  a  result,  very  large  fluctuations  of  transient
beam-loading would be expected from multi-bunch  trains.
Fortunately, thanks  to  intercell coupling  (about 1%  here)
RF  power propagates from  cell  to  cell  and  will  tend  to
even  the  individual  cell  excitations.  Some  fluctuation
however  still  remains  due  to 
the  finite  propagation
velocity  of  the  RF  wave.  In  addition,  with  a  chopped
beam  pulse,  periodic  gaps  are  cut  in  the  regular  bunch
train. Modelling the cavity as a single resonator results  in
a perfect sawtooth-like voltage due to  the  periodic  beam-
loading and refilling  of  the  cavity.  With  the  multi-mode
analysis,  the  fluctuation  is  increased  and  follows  the
oscillation caused by  the  closest  mode to  the  accelerating
Pi-mode of  the  passband. The energy gain  modulation  is
then increased by a factor larger than 3 (Fig.3).

3  CAVITY  FIELD  FLUCTUATIONS
Due  to  beam  phase  slippage  effects  of  proton  beams
inside and  outside  the  cavities,  energy  spread  exhibits  a
much  larger sensitivity  to  cavity  fields  fluctuations  than
for  relativistic  electron  beams.  Furthermore,  in  case  of
multiple  cavities driven by  one single  power  source,  the
control of the vector sum of the cavity voltages is not  any
more  as  efficient  as  for  relativistic  beams  since  the

dynamic  behaviour  differs  from  one  cavity  to  another.
With N  cavities driven by  one single  klystron,  a total  of
6· N coupled differential equations per klystron is required.

- 3 equations per cavity for beam-cavity interaction

Instead of using the  crude RF-gap  approximation (cosine-
like  acceleration  at  the  cavity  middle,  corrected  by  the
transit  time  factor)  we  preferred  to  integrate  the  exact
differential  equations  in  each  cavity  in  order  to  model
properly  the  beam-cavity  interaction.  Once  the  linac
configuration has  been  defined  (cavity  types,  number  of
cryomodules,  design  accelerating  field  and  synchronous
phase) a reference particle is launched through  the  linac in
order to set the nominal phase of  the  field with  respect to
bunch at the entrance of all cavities.

- 3· N equations per klystron for cavity field

The dynamics of  each resonator is  described by  two  first
order  differential  equations,  plus  another  one  modelling
dynamic cavity detuning by the  Lorentz forces [4].  Beam-
loading is  modelled by  a cavity voltage drop during  each
bunch passage with  a magnitude  varying  from  cavity  to
another. In order to minimize the needed RF power,
1) the Qex is set near the optimal coupling (about 5 105)
2) the cavity is detuned to compensate the  reactive beam-
loading due to the non-zero beam phase
3.4 One cavity per klystron

The  cavity  voltages  are  controlled  by  modulating  the
amplitude  and  phase  of  the  power  source  via  an  I/Q
modulator.  The  in-phase  and  out-of-phase  feedback  loop
gains  are  set  to  100  and  50,  respectively.  Examples  of
error sources, which were studied, are reproduced below.

 Input energy offset

Bunch phase oscillations induced by beam injection  errors
will  upset  cavity  voltage  via  beam-loading.  Without
feedback, the  bunches become unstable very  soon,  while
with  feedback,  cavity  voltages  are  efficiently  controlled
and the constant field dynamics are recovered (Fig. 4).

 Lorentz  forces

Because of the peak surface fields and of  the  mechanical
rigidity of the structure, Lorentz force parameter increases
as the  cavity beta decreases. Simulations  were carried out
with  expected values of  16,  8  and 4  Hz/(MV/m)2 for  the
three b = 0.5, 0.65 and 0.86 cavity  types.  In  order to  relax

the feedback requirements, the cavity must  be pre-detuned,
such  that  the  resonance  frequency  equals  the  operating
frequency at approximately half the beam pulse.  The total
detuning must then be set to the sum  of  the  detunings for
Lorentz  forces  and  beam-loading  compensations.  Fig.5
shows the resulting phase and energy errors of all  bunches
of the train at the linac exit. The extra power is maximum
at  beginning  of  linac (14%) and decreases as  energy  gain
per cavity grows.

3.5 Multiple cavities per klystron

With  relativistic  electron  beams,  multiple  cavities
powered by a single power source can be easily controlled
by  the  vector sum  of  the  cavity voltages [4,5].  However
for proton  beams,  since the  dynamic behaviour  of  low-b
cavities  varies  as  the  energy  increases,  even  when  the
vector  sum  is  kept  perfectly  constant,  the  individual
cavity  voltages  can  fluctuate  dramatically.  We  could
however envisage to  feed individually  the  cavities  at  the
low  energy  part  of  the  SC  linac  and  to  feed  groups  of
cavities by single klystrons at the high energy  part,  where
the cavities have closer dynamic properties. Assuming  for

The  systematic  energy  modulation,  enhanced  by
transient beam-loading effects within  a  multi-cell  cavity,
looks actually harmless (about 10-3) by  using  SC  cavities
with  low  number  of  cells  and  not  too  small  intercell
coupling  (respectively 5  and 1%  in  this  study).  Besides,
the impact of  various error sources on  energy stability  in
a typical SC proton linac  has  been studied by  means of  a
simulation  code, which integrates the  coupled  differential
equations  governing  both  cavity  field  and  beam-cavity
interaction. When  each  cavity  has  its  own  RF  feedback
system,  the  cavity voltages can  be  very  well  controlled,
providing energy spreads at  the  linac end well  below  the
specifications.  However,  groups  of  multiple  cavities
driven  by  one  common  klystron  and  controlled  by  the
vector  sum,  give  rise  to  significant  energy  fluctuations
and should only  be  used  in  high  energy  part,  when  the
cavity dynamic properties become similar.

                         The article presents new model of equilibrium in open chemical systems suggesting a
linear dependence of the reaction shift from equilibrium in presence of the external
thermodynamic force. Basic equation of this model contains traditional logarithmic
term  and  a  non-traditional  parabolic 
the
non-traditional term equals to zero turning the whole equation to the traditional form
of  constant  equation.  This  term  coincides  with  the  excessive  thermodynamic
function  revealing  linear  relationship  between  logarithm  of  the  thermodynamic
activity coefficient and reaction extent at open equilibrium. Discovered relationship
prompts  us  to  use  in  many  systems  a  combination  of  the  linearity  coefficient  and
reaction shift from true equilibrium rather then activity coefficients. The coefficient
of linearity can be found by thermodynamic computer simulation while the shift is
an  independent  variable  defining  the  open  equilibrium  state.  Numerical  data

INTRODUCTION: BACK TO CHEMICAL DYNAMICS.
Nowadays  we  know  that  chemical  self-organization  happens  in  a  vaguely  defined  area
far-from-equilibrium [1], while classical thermodynamics defines what is frozen at the point
of true equilibrium. What occurs in between?
True ,  or 
internal   thermodynamic  equilibrium  is  defined  by  current  thermodynamic
paradigm  only  for  isolated  systems.  That s  why  applications  to  real  systems  often  lead  to
severe misinterpretation of their status, bringing approximate rather than precise results. A few
questions arise in this relation. Is it possible to expand the idea of thermodynamic equilibrium
to open systems? How to describe and simulate open equilibrium in chemical systems? Is there
any  relationship  between  deviation  of  a  chemical  system  from 
true   equilibrium  and
parameters of its non-ideality?
Traditional methods use excessive thermodynamic functions to account external interaction of
some  system s  components.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  functions  and  related  coefficients  of
thermodynamic activity were introduced rather for convenience [2], first playing a role of fig
leave for the lack of our knowledge of what s going on in real systems.
One of the current methods in equilibrium thermodynamics of open systems, to a certain extent
influenced this work, was offered by D. Korzhinsky [3]. Considering interaction of open systems
within  the  multisystem,  the  method  distinguishes  between  the  common,  or  mobile  components
and  specific  for  each  subsystem  inert  components,  which  cannot  be  present  in  any  other
subsystem.  The  mobile  components  are  responsible  for  the  subsystems  interaction  and  carry
intensive thermodynamic characteristics, thus contributing the subsystem s Gibb s potential. It is
important that coefficients of thermodynamic activity of the mobile components may vary while
for the inert components they do not have any physical sense [4]. The model successfully resulted
in  well  developed  theory  of  multisystems  with  extensive  application  output  [5].  In  the

2

Korzhynsky s model openness of the system is simulated with two-level component stratification
and  appropriate  expression  for  change  of  Gibbs   potential.  Interaction  with  other  parts  of  the
multisystem in this model may be simulated via series of consecutive titrations of the subsystem
by mobile components.
To  answer  the  above  questions  more  consistently,  we  used  currently  almost  neglected  de
Donder s  method  which  has  introduced  the  thermodynamic  affinity,  interpreting  it  as  a
thermodynamic force and considering the reaction extent a  chemical distance  [6]. For greater
convenience  and  universalization  of  the  method,  we  have  redefined  the  reaction  extent  as
dξj=dnkj/ηkj,  instead  of  dξj=dnkj/νkj  by  de  Donder,  or ∆ξj  =∆nkj/ηkj  in  increments.  Value  of ∆nkj
equals to amount of moles, consumed or appeared in j-reaction between its two arbitrary states,
more  often  one  of  them  is  the  initial  state.  The  ηij    value  equals  to  a  number  of  moles  of
k-component, consumed or appeared in an isolated j-reaction on its way from initial state to true
equilibrium  and  may  be  considered  a  thermodynamic  equivalent  of  chemical  transformation.
Thus redefined value of the reaction extent remains the same being calculated for any component
of a simple chemical reaction; the only (and easily achievable by appropriate choice of the basis
of the chemical system) condition for this is that each chemical element is involved in only one
substance  on  each  side  of  the  reaction  equation.  Now,  in  our  definition  ∆ξj  is  a  dimentionless
chemical  distance  ( cd )  between  initial  and  running  states  of  j-reaction,  0=  ∆ξj=1,  and
thermodynamic affinity A = - (∆G/∆ξ)p,T turns into a classical force by definition, customary in
physics and related sciences.
Chemical  reaction  in  isolated  system  is  driven  only  by  internal  force  (eugenaffinity,  Aij).  True
thermodynamic equilibrium occurs at Aij = 0 and at this point ∆ξj = 1. Reactions in open system
are driven by both internal and external (Aej ) forces [7] where the external force originates from
chemical or, in general, thermodynamic (also due to heat exchange, pressure, etc.) interaction of
the  open  system  with  its  environment.  Linear  constitutional  equations  of  non-equilibrium
thermodynamics  at  zero  reaction  rate  give  us  the  condition  of  the  open   equilibrium  with
resultant affinity

A*ij + aie A*ej = 0,                                                          (1)
where  aie    is  the  Onsager  coefficient  [7].  The  accent  mark  and  asterisk  relate  values  to  isolated
( true ) or open equilibrium correspondingly.
In  this  work  we  will  use  only  one  assumption  which  in  fact  slightly  extends  the  hypothesis  of
linearity.  Taking  as  given  that  there  must  be  a  relation  between  the  reaction  shift  from
equilibrium δξj =1 - ∆ξj  and  external thermodynamic force causing this shift, we will suppose at
the first approximation that the reaction shift in the vicinity✩ of  true thermodynamic equilibrium
is linearly related to the shifting  force

δξj = αie Aej .                                                                  (2)
Recalling that Ai =-(∂Gi /∂ξi ), or Ai =-(∆Gi /∆ξi ) and substituting (2) into (1), we will have after a
simple transformation and retaining in writing only ∆j  for ∆ξj  and δj for δξj

∆G*ij  + bie δ*j ∆*j = 0,                                                           (3)

where bie = aie /αie. Corresponding constant equation is

∆G0

ij  + RTlnΠ*j (η, ∆*j) + bie (1−∆* j )∆*j = 0,                                          (4)

where Π*j (η, ∆*j) is the activities product with mole fractions expressed using rection extent.
So, as soon as chemical system becomes open, given the above assumption its Gibbs  potential
and the appropriate constant equation include a non-linear, non-classical term originated due to

   discussion will take place later on.

 system s interaction with its environment.
What opens up immediately is a similarity between the non-classical term of (4) and the well
known product r⋅x⋅(1-x) from the chaotic equation [8]. To get more symmetric shape of (4) we
may change it introducing a new value - the  non-thermodynamic , or alternative temperature of
the open system

∆G0

Ta = bie / R,                                                                   (5)
where R is universal gas constant. The value of Ta is introduced in this work for convenience and
symmetry; we cannot give any explanation of its physical meaning at this moment.
The logarithmic term contains well defined thermodynamic temperature Tt , and (4) turns to

Recall  well  known  classical  expression  ∆G0
presenting  the  activity  product  at  open  equilibrium  as  Π*j  (ηkj,  ∆*j)=  Π{[(n0
∆*j)/Σ]
defining reduced temperature as τ = Ta /Tt  we transform equation (6) into

 ij + RTt ln Π*j + RTa ∆*j (1−∆*j) =0.                                           (6)
  ij    =  -  RTln  Ki  .  Now,  dividing  (6)  by  (-RTt  ),

Being divided by ∆*j , this equation still expresses linearity between the thermodynamic force and
reaction shift

{ln [Π`(ηkj,1)/ Π(ηkj , ∆*j)]}/ ∆*j = - τ j δ*j,                                             (8)
while  numerator  of  the  left  part  is  a  new  expression  for  the  thermodynamic  force.  Containing
parameters η and τ, and variable ∆*j (or δ*j), equation (7) in general can be written as

φ* = φ (∆*, η, τ).                                                               (9)
It is easy to see that in case of isolated system δ*= 0, τ = 0 as well as the thermodynamic force
equals to zero, and (7) turns to the normal constant equation

g* = g (P, T, n*).                                                               (10)

We distinguish between them calling (9) the Greek and (10) - the Gibbs  (Latin) equations. For
better  understanding  of  internal  relations  between  (9)  and  (10)  one  should  recall  that
η, serving as a parameter in the Greek equation, is the only output from the Gibbs  equation
(because η = n`- n0, where right side contains equilibrium and initial mole amounts).

INVESTIGATION OF THE FORCE-SHIFT RELATIONSHIP.
First,  consider  the  force  expression  from  equation  (8).  Its  numerator  is  a  logarithm  of  a
combination of molar parts products for a given stoichiometric equation. The expression under
the  logarithm  sign  is  the  molar  parts  product  for  ideal  system  divided  by  the  same  product
where  ηkj  replaced  by  a  product  (∆*jηkj)  due  to  the  system s  shift  from 
true   equilibrium.
Table  1  represents  functions  Π`(ηkj,1)/  Π(ηkj  ,  ∆*j)  for  some  simple  chemical  reactions  with
initial  amounts  of  reactants  A  and  B  equal  to  one  mole.  Graphs  of  the  reaction  shifts  vs
thermodynamic forces are shown at Fig. 1. One can see well expressed linearity on shift-force
curves. The linearity extent depends on the η value.
Going down to real objects, consider a model system containing a double compound A•R and an
independent reactant I (for instance, sulfur) such that I reacts only with A•, while •R restricts
reaction ability of A• and releases in the reaction as far as A• is consumed. Symbol A• relates to
reactant  A,  pertaining  to  the  open  to  an  interaction  with  R  system  (A,I).  Two  competing
processes take place in the system - decomposition of A•R, or control reaction (C): A•R = A• +
R,  and  leading  reaction  (L):  A•  +  I  = Σ*L,  the  right  side  in  the  last  case  represents  a  sum  of
products. Resulting reaction in the system is A•R + I = Σ*L + R.  To  obtain  numbers  for  real
substances,  we  used  thermodynamic  simulation  (HSC  Chemistry  for  Windows)  in  the  model
set of substances.

The  most  important  is  the  fact  that  in  both  cases  the  data,  showing  the  reality  of  linear
relationship,  have  been  received  using  exclusively  current  formalism  of  chemical  equilibrium
where  no  such  kind  of  relationship  was  ever  assumed  at  all.  It  is  quite  obvious  that  linear
dependence  took  place  in  some  cases  up  to  essential  values  of  deviation  from  equilibrium.
Results  shown  on  Fig.1  and  Fig.2  prove  the  basics  and  some  conclusions  of  the  method  of
chemical dynamics.

FROM CHEMICAL DYNAMICS TO CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS:
THERMODYNAMIC ACTIVITY AND REACTION SHIFT AT OPEN EQUILIBRIUM.
It was already mentioned that classical thermodynamics has no idea of thermodynamic force.
Instead,  the  impact  of  the  system s  interaction  results  in  its  non-ideality  and  usually  is
accounted by means of excessive thermodynamic functions and coefficients of thermodynamic
activity

 Qj = - RTt ln Πγkj.                                                            (10)
Within current paradigm of chemical thermodynamics, constant equation for non-ideal system
with γkj ≠1 is

j  = - RTt ln Π*γkj - RTt⋅ln Π*xkj,                                             (11)
where power values, equal to stoichiometric coefficients, are omitted for simplicity, and xkj are
molar fractions. The non-linear term of the Greek equation also belongs to a non-ideal system,
and comparison of (6) and (11) leads to following equality in open equilibrium

∆G0

 τj δ*j = (− ln Π* γkj)/ ∆*j.                                                       (12)
This result is quite understandable. For instance, in case of A•R the chemical bond between A
and R reduces reaction activity of A; the same result will be obtained for reaction (A + I) with
reduced coefficient of thermodynamic activity of A.
Now, to avoid complexity and using only one common component A• in both subsystems, the
relationship between the L-shift and activity coefficient of A• is very simple

δ*L = (1/ τL) [(-ln γ*)/ ∆* L],       

                                    (14)
where [(-ln γ*)/ ∆*L]  represents  divided  by  RTt  external  thermodynamic  force  acting  against
L-reaction..  This  expression  for  the  force  as  well  as  the  total  equation  (14)  are  new.  This
equation  connects  values  from  chemical  dynamics  with  traditional  values  of  classical
thermodynamics.  Yet  again,  at  δ*L=  0  we  have  immediately  γ*=1,  and  vice  versa,  a
correlation, providing an explicit and instant transition between open and isolated systems. In
case  of  multiple  interactions  one  should  expect  additivity  of  the  shift  increments,  caused  by
interaction  with  different  reaction  subsystems,  which  follows  the  additivity  of  appropriate
logarithms of activity coefficients. It was also proved by simulation.
Data  for  Fig.  3  were  obtained  using  two  different  methods  of  thermodynamic  simulation.
I-simulation relates to an isolated (A•R+I) system with real R and A and γA•R =1 in all cases. In
O-simulation a combination of  |A•+Y2O3+I|  represented  the  model  of  open  system  where  •R
was excluded and replaced by neutral to A and I yttrium oxide to keep the same total amount of
moles in the system as in I-simulation and avoid interaction between A and R. Binding of A
into  double  compounds  with  R,  resulting  in  reduced  reaction  ability  of  A,  was  simulated
varying γΑ. I-simulation provided a relationship in corresponding rows of the δ*L - γ* values,
and  O-simulation  -  with  δ*L  -  ∆G0
A  •R  correspondence.  Standard  change  of  Gibbs
potential ∆G0
C,  determining  strength  of  the  A•R  bond,  was  considered  an  excessive
thermodynamic function to the L-reaction.

It is worthy to mention that the range of activity coefficients usable in equilibrium calculations
seems to be extendible down to unusually low powers (see Fig.1).
Strong relation between reaction shifts and activity coefficients means automatically strong
relation  between  shifts  and  excessive  thermodynamic  functions,  or  external  thermodynamic
forces.  Along  with  standard  change  of  Gibbs   potential  we  also  tried  two  others  -  the QL
which was calculated by equation (14) with γ*, used in the O- simulation, and another, ∆G*L
 ,
found  as  a  difference  between  ∆G0
L  and  equilibrium  value  of  RTt⋅lnΠ*xiL.  Referring  to  the
same ∆*L, all three should be equal or close in values. Almost ideal match, illustrating this idea,
was found in the CoO•R - S system and is shown on Fig.4. In other systems all three were less but
still enough close. Analysis of the values, which may be used as possible excessive functions,
shows that the open equilibrium may be defined using both external (like ∆G0
C) and internal
(the bound affinity, see [4]) values as well as, say, a neutral, or general value like a function
calculated by (14) at given activity coefficient. In principle all three may be used to calculate
or evaluate τL∆. This allows us to reword more explicitly the problem set in the beginning of
this  work  and  explain  the  alternative  temperature  more  clear.  It  is  easy  to  see  that  equation
(14) represents another form of the shift-force linearity.

Multiplying nominator and denumerator of its right side by RTt  and recalling that τL∆ = (Tch
/Tt)∆*L one can receive

δ*L = [1/(RTa)]  (QE / ∆*L),                                              (15)
where QE is  a  general  symbol  for  excessive  thermodynamic  function.  It  means  that  the  shifting
force is unambiguously related to the excessive function, and the alternative temperature is just
inverse to the coefficient of proportionality between the force and the shift it causes. The product
RTa has dimension of energy while ∆ and δ stay dimentionless.  
Because  we  ran  thermodynamic  simulation  within  a  certain  range  of  initial  ratios  between
components of  the  reaction  mixtures  it  was  interesting  to  see  what  a  difference  it  made.  Fig.  7
shows no essential dependence of the τL∆ value on this ratio in the CoO•R - C system.

A POSSIBILITY OF MULTIPLE STATES AT OPEN CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM.
Recall that equations (7) and (8) describe open equilibrium, first in terms of Gibbs potential of
the open system, second - in terms of the thermodynamic force applied to it. While the force in
the  vicinity   of  equilibrium  is  linear  regarding  reaction  shift,  the  potential  depends  upon  it
parabolically  thus  leading  to  bifurcations  [1]  or  multiple  possible  states  of  chemical  system  in
open equilibrium.
To obtain graphs of the Greek equation, we varied τ, ηi and ∆*j given reaction stoichiometric
equation with reasonable coefficients and initial mole amounts of reactants. One of such sets
for reaction A+B = AB and ηkj = 0.1 m. is shown on Fig.1.
More complicated reaction equations do not bring essential difference in the curve shapes.
Open  equilibrium  state  in  this  particular  model  is  defined  essentially  by  standard  change  of
Gibbs  potential ∆G0
C of A•R formation from A and R as major restricting factor.  Some results
of  the  thermodynamic  simulation  are  plotted  in  coordinates  ∆*L-  ∆G0

Solution to the Greek equation is not unique if τ and the external thermodynamic  force  exceed
certain  values.  That  leads  to  a  very  important  conclusion  that  the  Zel`dovich s  theorem  [9],

declaring the uniqueness of the state of the chemical equilibrium, is not  valid beyond a certain
extent of openness of chemical system.
This part of the work was touched only slightly. One statement can be done for sure - the less is
the value of η, that is the "weaker" is the chemical reaction, the less external force is necessary to
bring  to  the  situation  with  multiple  states  at  open  equilibrium.  It  is  well  recognized  that  the
bifurcations are more probable  for weak reactions [1].

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS.
We  are  unable  to  simulate  and  compute  equilibrium  composition  of  most  complex  chemical
systems if we don t know appropriate coefficients of thermodynamic activity, and their numeric
values are very expensive. The method of chemical dynamics offers an easier and involving much
less efforts way to run that kind of research. Indeed, equilibrium of complex chemical system per
this method may be interpreted as equilibrium of subsystems  shifts from their  true  equilibrium
states, explicitly defined by the basic equation for j-subsystem. Now, having the ηkj   value from
solution  for  the  isolated  state  and  τj  as  a  characteristic  for  subsystem  response  to  external
thermodynamic perturbation (as it was above described in details), we have equation containing
only δ*j  as variable and τj  as a parameter of the theory

−lnΚj  = ln Π(ηkj,δ*j) - τj ∆* δ*j.                                               (20)

Below the critical value of  φ* this equation has only one solution (see Fig. 6).
Current  methods  of  simulation  of  complex  equilibria  use  the  constant  equations  (or  equivalent
expressions if minimizing Gibbs  potential of subsystems) in the same form as if the subsystems
were isolated. Their joint solution is only to restrict consuming the common participants and thus
achieve  material  balance  within  the  system  playing  an  accounting  role.  Application  of  current
methods  to  real  systems  leads  to  some  errors  in  simulation  results  originated  due  to
misinterpretation  of  their  status  [10].  Here  developed  method,  assuming  subsystems   states  as
open equilibria within a complex equilibrium, must give more correct numerical output.
A  principal  feature  of  application  following  from  here  developed  method  consists  in  usage  of
reaction  shift  (as  the  the  system s  response  to  external  impact)  multiplied  by  proportionality
coefficient δ*j    rather  than  activity  coefficient γkj.  Due  to  an  easy  way  to  obtain  value  of τj    by
thermodynamic simulation within minutes (not hours!), the method of chemical dynamics brings
new opportunities into analysis and simulation of complex chemical systems.

DISCUSSION.
The  new  basic  equation  received  in  this  work  links  equilibrium  and  non-equilibrium
thermodynamics and may be rewritten more generally as

j  + RTt f t (∆*j) − RTa f a  (∆*j).                                        (21)
The found relationship between reaction shift and external force resembles to a great extent the
well known Hooke s law [11] with its linearity at low elongations of a stretched material and its
yield point. In our case the yield point, where the curve sharply deviates from the straight line
or in some cases just changes the slope, was very distinctive on all plots. By analogy, the value
of  1/τL∆ may  be  considered  a  coefficient  and  the  yield  point  -  a  limit  of  thermodynamic
proportionality. This limit of the force-shift linearity may help to conceive the meanings of  in
the vicinity of  and  far from  equilibrium areas.
We cannot tell to what extent the coefficient and the limit of thermodynamic proportionality may
be considered characteristics of a chemical elasticity thus providing complete return of chemical
reaction back  to  initial  point  when  the  chemical  force    returns  to  zero  value,  that  is  without  or
with a sort of chemical hysteresis in force-shift coordinates. This problem could be investigated in
the  future  research.  It  must  be  clearly  understood  that  despite  the  universality  of  the  basic
equation it would be wrong to state that any system may occur in the classical or non-classical
areas depending on external conditions.

We  call  this  method,  including  the  original  de  Donder s  approach,  a  method  of  chemical
dynamics, or a force-shift method for explicit usage of chemical forces, originally introduced as
thermodynamic  affinities.  The  method  treats  true,  isolated  thermodynamic  equilibrium  of  a
system  as  a  reference  state  for  its  open  equilibrium  when  the  system  becomes  a  part  of  a
supersystem. This reference state is memorized in ηkj. Such approach well matches interpretation
of equilibrium at zero control parameters as origin of the chaosity scale (S-theorem, [12]). Based
on a very simple and quite natural assumption, the basic equation of the present work naturally
and  smoothly  drags  non-linearity  into  thermodynamics  of  open  systems  thus  bridging  a  gap
between classical and non-classical thermodynamics.
Addressing to a skeptical reader, we d like to underline that all new results of this work have been
received  and  proved  numerically  strictly  within 
the  current  paradigm  of  chemical
thermodynamics.  Our  non-traditional  term  of  the  basic  equation  already  existed  in  chemical
thermodynamics  in  form  of  excessive  thermodynamic  function.  This  work  offers  alternative
description of its origin and its relation to an external impact on the chemical system. From this
point of view, we consider results of this work neither revolutionary nor contradictory. We just
tried to find out what has been lost or hidden when chemical system, the major object of chemical
thermodynamics, has been idealized as an isolated entity.

Following a previous proposition of quaternity spacetime for electronic orbitals in neon 

shell,  this  paper  describes  the  geometrical  course  each  electron  takes  as  it  oscillates 

harmonically  within  a  certain  quaternity  space  dimension  and  provides  the  concrete 

connections  between  geometries  and  trigonometric  wavefunctions  that  observe  Pythagorean 

theorem.  By  integrating  four  quaternity  space  dimensions  with  conventional  Cartesian 

coordinate  systems  in  calculus,  we  explain  electronic  motions  by  Maxwell’s  equation  and 

general  Stokes’  theorem  from  the  principles  of  rotation  operation and  space/time  symmetry. 

Altogether with the previous reports, we have effectively established quaternity spacetime as 

a  successful  theory  in  elucidating  the  orbital  shapes  and  motions  of  electrons  within  inert 

atoms such as helium and neon. We point out once again that 2px, 2py, and 2pz orbitals have 

different geometrical shapes as well as orthogonal orientations, contrary to the traditional 2p

1.  Introduction 

In  a  previous  report  [1],  we  introduced  a  fresh  spacetime  concept  to  account  for  a 

four-dimensional  spherical  layer  such  as  neon  shell  where  eight  electrons  are  oscillating 

harmonically  in  four  various  space  and  time  dimensions,  obeying  quaternity  equation 

individually and simultaneously:

generalized time dimension in neon shell. As typical solutions to quaternity equation, we have 

also characterized 2s2p electrons by eight trigonometric wavefunctions:

Between  every  two  adjacent  electrons  in  neon  shell,  there  is  always  a  rotation  relation 

distance, i.e., a differential operation with respect to a minus time dimension accompanied by 

an  integral  operation  over  a  space  dimension.  For  instance,  the  relationship  between

which  can  be  derived  by  applying  relationship  (4)  to  wavefunctions  in  equation  (2).  For 

brevity, we shall only consider the relationship of their first terms because the first term can 

be treated as a dynamic pointer pointing towards the head of the whole electronic curvilinear 

vector.

where

  and

  refer  to  the  first  term  of 

0Φ   and 

1Φ in  equation  (2)  respectively. 

Equation (7) indicates that the rate of time component reduction from a full time dimension to 

vanishing  is  equal  to  the  rate  of  space  component  change  from  a  full  space  dimension  to 

vanishing, which can be equivalently expressed in trigonometry as:

Thus radians 

0Ω

  and 

2Ω

  constitute two acute angles of a right triangle so that equation (8) 

2

 

 

 

 

is an alternative expression of Pythagorean theorem. By the way, since both complementary 

angles  represent  time  and  space  radians,  respectively,  they  must  coexist  as  a  product  in  the 

wavefunction, i.e., one cannot substitute the other.   

The  forgoing  deduction  has  adopted  the  following  new  interpretation  of  calculus  on 

trigonometric functions: 

Definition 1. For a trigonometric function such as

=y

θcos

, a differential operation of y with 

respect  to  radian  θ  means  increasing  θ  variable  a  displacement  of 

2π   in  the  function. 

Definition 2. For a trigonometric function such as 

=z

ϑcos

, an integral operation of z over 

ϑ  means reducing  ϑ  variable a displacement of

2π   in the function. 

The  correctness  of  both  definitions  can  be  easily  proved  by  the  property  of  cosine  and 

sine  functions  in  calculus.  The  difference  between  conventional  differentiation  concept  and 

the  above  radian  angle  rotation  definitions  is  that  the  latter  traverses  the  full  range  of 

2π  

radian whereas the former only catches the terminal state at a certain radian value. The latter 

is  actually  the  dynamic  implementation  of  the  former.  Thus,  in  a  more  general  manner,  the 

process  of  a  differential  operation  on  a  wavefunction  can  be  expressed  as  a  cosine  or  sine 

function with a changing radian variable, which leads to two theorems with regard to dynamic 

Theorem  1.  For  a  trigonometric  wavefunction  y,  the  derivative  term 

y ∂∂−
t

  can  be 

expressed as the changing rate of variable y from a full time dimension t to vanish following a 

=

θcosA

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(9) 

where  A  is  an  orthogonal  quantity  to  θcos

,  t  is  a  fix  time  dimension,  and  the  sinuously 

changing  range  of  y  (t,  0)  value  corresponds  to  radian  range  θ(0, 

2π )  in  the  dynamic 

Theorem 2. For a trigonometric wavefunction z, the derivative term 

z ∂∂
l

  can be expressed 

as the changing rate of variable z from a full space dimension l to vanish following a sine rule 

=

ϑsinA

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(10) 

where  A  is  an  orthogonal  quantity  to  ϑsin ,  l  is  a  fix  space  dimension,  and  the  sinuously 

changing  range  of  z  (l,  0)  value  corresponds  to  radian  range  ϑ(

2π ,  0)  in  the  dynamic 

By  interpreting  differential  operations  in  terms  of  trigonometric  functions,  we  have 

provided  the  implementation  for  dynamic  differential  processes.  Conventional  differential

operation  is only  concerned  with  the  final  result of  the  operation,  ignoring  the  intermediary 

course or process. However, the result is only instantaneous locating at a discrete point of  θ 

(such as 

=θ

2π ) along a continuous curve while the process is perennial covering the full 

range  of  θ(0, 

2π )  variable  in  the  smooth  curve.  This  sheds  light  on  the  relationship 

between  the  discrete  variable  and  the  continuous  variable,  i.e.,  the  discrete  result  is  only  a 

special  point  on  the  continuous  curve.  Thus  the  dynamic  process  of  differential  operation 

upon  a  wavefunction  is  richer  in  physical  meaning  than  its  mere  final  result.  Given  these 

considerations, we shall examine the process of wavefunction transformations from one state 

to another via their dynamic pathways in trigonometry and geometry in the following section.   

2.  Pythagorean theorem in quaternity space 

The electron octet as were listed in equation (2) form four pairs of conjugated complex 

functions,  each  pair  with  four  velocity  dimensions  apart: 

0Φ   and 

4Φ   are  a  pair  of  2s 

electrons; 

1Φ

  and 

5Φ   are a pair of 2px electrons; 

2Φ   and 

6Φ   are a pair of 2py electrons; 

and 

3Φ

  and 

7Φ

  are  a  pair  of  2p

z  electrons  (Figure  1).  Because  of  their  various  orbital 

types, electronic rotations from one state to another make four distinctive spatial courses that 

obey  Pythagorean  theorem  in  four  unique  right  triangles.  In  the  following  subsections,  we 

shall consider the geometry of four electronic transformations

2.1 One-dimensional harmonic oscillation 

Figure 2(a) indicates the state change of a 2s electron to a 2px type along straight line 

OB.  The  2s  electron,  which  initially  permeates  the  entire  sphere  as  dimensionless  cloud, 

gradually contracts its activity sphere while its spherical center moves towards point B, which 

may represent a solid charge. The transformation corresponds to wavefunction evolution from

can  be  regarded  as  a  four-dimensional  time  with  zero  dimensional  space.  Time  dimension 

reduction  is  undergoing  with  space  dimension  increment  as  the  electron  transforms  from 

misty  cloud  to  a  real  particle.  With  the  increase  of 

2Ω   angle  from  0  to  π/2,  the  temporal 

radius of sphere O reduces from OB to EB. At a specific moment, center O moves to center E, 

which  is  the  vertical  projection  of  point  A  along  a  smooth  semicircular  arc  OAB.  In  other 

words, spherical center E is traveling along straight line OB but follows harmonic oscillation 

principle as if it travels uniformly along semicircular arc OAB.   

Figure  2  Electronic  transformations  track  along  semicircular  arcs  of  various  space 

dimensions in four harmonic oscillations: (a) 2px-oribtal, (b) 2py-orbital, (c) 2pz-orbital, and

representing a 2px electronic state. In right triangle OAB, side AB is the time component of 

the  electron,  corresponding  to  the  product  of  hypotenuse  OB  and 

cos Ω ,  projecting  into 

radius EB, and decreasing, whereas side AO is its space displacement from its initial state, i.e., 

particle  size,  corresponding  to  the  product  of  hypotenuse  OB  and 

sin Ω   factor,  which  is 

increasing. The semicircular orbit OAB is the pathway for the electron to cover the abstract 

distance of diameter OB, the full 1D space element,  or the final spatial displacement of the 

electron from its initial 2s state. At point B, the electron has possessed one-dimensional space 

OB, and has three-dimensional time accordingly. As the electron traverses along this 1D space 

2

dimension, we shall call this dynamic process a 2px orbital. 

2.2 Two-dimensional harmonic oscillation 

As  shown  in  Figure  5(b),  a  2py  electron  E  is  traveling  along  a  semicircular  arc  from 

points  B  to  C  as  radian  angle 

  increases  from  π/2  to  π  (i.e.,  decreases  from  π/2  to  0  in 

2Ω

right triangle BEC). The electron may manifest as magnetic flux during the process. In right 

triangle  BEC,  point  B  denotes

space  component  of  2p

y electron  while  side  CE  is  time  component  of  the  electron.  Space 

dimension  is  increasing  while  time  dimension  is  decreasing.  Diameter  BC  corresponds  to  a 

full 2D space element for the electron to attain, and semicircular arc BEC is the pathway to 

traverse that dimension. As the electron at B tracks along the semicircular arc to C, it draws 

the shape of a 2py orbital as a semicircular ring on the plane. 

2.3 Three-dimensional harmonic oscillation 

Figure 5(c) explains the motion of a 2pz-electron. It is the revolution of semicircular arc 

BEC around the axis BC. The position of whole arc BEC is determined by angle 

2Ω

  in right 

triangle  DEF.  With  the  increase  of 

2Ω   angle  from  π  to  3π/2  (i.e.,  from  0  to  π/2  in  right 

triangle DEF), arc BEC sweeps a hemispherical surface, which gives the shape of a full 2pz 

orbital.  This initial  arc  position  BDC  denotes

interval between arcs BDC and BEC measured by side DE in right triangle DEF represents 

space  component  of  the  electron  whereas  chord  FE  denote  its  time  component.  Space 

increases  while  time  dwindles.  A  full  2pz  orbital has  wrapped  the  3D  hemispherical  surface

represented by diametrical chord DF. Its geometrical shape is a hollow hemispherical surface 

such as BDCFE as was shown in Figure 2(c). 

2.4 Four-dimensional harmonic oscillation 

Figure 5(d) indicates electronic transformation from 2pz to 2s types, which involves the 

expansion  of  a  spherical  surface,  in  which  the  radius  OE,  the  maximum  radius  OG,  and 

tangential line GE form a right triangle. The radial expands via the course of arc OEG. Point 

O denotes

  angle  from  3π/3  to  2π  (i.e.,  decrease  from  π/2  to  0  in 

2Ω

right triangle OEG), side OE is space component of 2s electron, which is increasing gradually, 

whereas side GE is time component of the electron, which diminishes in the meanwhile. Arc 

OEG is the pathway to traverse the 4D space element represented by diametrical chord OG.   

As the whole spherical surface expands along the radial direction, the electron disperses 

over the entire sphere so that the geometrical shape of 2s electron is a continuous solid sphere 

of four dimensions in space. A full 2s orbital, whose time dimension becomes zero rendering 

the  whole  spherical  space  instantaneous,  proceeds  to  further  oscillation  cycles  via

The  forgoing  description  demonstrated  the  same  principle  of  right  triangles,  i.e., 

Pythagorean  theorem  as  was  expressed  by  equation  (8).  A  2p-orbital  is  one-dimensionally 

oriented  in  space;  a  2py-oribital  moves  on  a  two-dimensional  planar  ring;  a  2pz-electron 

sweeps around a three-dimensional hemispherical surface; and a 2s-orbital permeates over the 

four-dimensional  sphere.  These  provide  the  visual  connections  between  geometries  and 

trigonometric  wavefunctions  as  were  listed  in  equation  (2).  Four  distinctive  diametrical 

chords OB, BC, DF, and OG in Figure 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d), respectively, represent four

respectively  via  their  subtending  semicircular  arcs.  We  shall  label  these  quaternity  space 

dimensions as 

3l

2l

, 

1l

, and 

0l

  that correspond to radian 

2Ω   revolution in a full period 

(Figure  3),  their  spatial  orientations  being  1D,  2D,  3D,  and  4D,  respectively.  We  may 

generalize 

3l

2l

, 

1l

, or 

0l

dimension as l, which refers to the outstanding space dimension 

of concern or the most immediate dimension in the wavefunction of concerned. 

3.  Quaternity space in Cartesian coordinates 

So far we have identified four distinct space dimensions 

3l

, 

2l

, 

1l

, and 

0l

  in spherical 

layer of neon shell, but how these dimension elements are related to Cartesian coordinates in 

X,  Y,  and  Z  orientations? First  of  all,  consider 

  dimension  in  Figure  2(a),  if  we  set  up  a 

3l

one-dimensional X axis along OB direction with the origin at point O, then for the electron to 

traverse 

3l

  dimension is equivalent to moving along X-axis, which gives the conformity of 

3l

  and X measures for 2p

x transformation in one-dimensional harmonic oscillation:

Secondly, in Figure 2(b) for 2py-orbital transformation, we may add Y-axis to X-axis to 

form  a  two-dimensional  Cartesian  plane  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  Chord  BE  is  the  space 

component  of  the  electron  in  quaternity,  which  form  a  hypotenuse  in  right  triangle  BEP. 

Following the rule of vector addition, we have

(12) 

where  vector  BE   can  be  expressed  as

  in  quaternity  space  in  the  dynamic

  because

Furthermore,  with  regard  to  2pz electronic  transformation  on  spherical  surface  as  was 

shown  in  Figure  2(c),  we  may  add  Z-axis  to  X-Y  axes  to  form  a  three-dimensional 

coordinates  system.  By  expressing  the  same  spherical  surface  vector  in  terms  of  quaternity

Thus we have developed the relationships between four dimensions in quaternity space and 

traditional  Cartesian  coordinates  in  differential  form.  These  integrations  are  very  important 

for  accurately  understanding  the  concept  of  quaternity  space  and  lay  the  foundation  for 

physical  integration  of  electronic  harmonic  oscillations  with  electromagnetism.  One  may 

interpret the principle of rotation operation in diverse physical manners. 

4.  Equilibrium of electrons by Stokes’ theorem 

We  have  described  electronic  motions  by  trigonometry  and  geometry  as  smooth  and 
2,  and  2s2  electrons 

continuous  spacetime  evolution  processes.  Each  pair  of  2px

2,  2py

2,  2pz

oscillate  harmonically  along  a  circle  of  one,  two,  three,  and  four  spatial  dimensions 

respectively. But how electrons synchronize their motions in various orbital states? We have 

shown that electronic rotation complies with electromagnetic laws in differential form. Here 

we shall further investigate the principle of rotation operation in integral form.   

4.1  Principle of rotation operation and spacetime symmetry 

Every two adjacent electrons obey the principle of rotation operation such as equation (6) 

where space dimension l refers to 

  that is one-dimensional in correspondence with X-axis 

3l

as  was  formulated  by  equation  (11).  Equation  (6)  describes  the  relationship  between  a  2s

By  the  principle  of  space  and  time  symmetry,  differentiations  upon  a  wavefunction

resultant dimensions:

where v1 is a velocity serving as a dimension compensator. Combining equations (6) and (26) 

which  means  that  the  rate  of  a  2s  spherical  contraction  is  proportional  to  the  rate  of  a  2px 

displacement from the center nucleus during their full cycle oscillations (Figure 2a). The same 

principles can be expressed in integral form as follows.

  and

  are  two  adjacent  electronic  orbitals  that  are  coupled  together  through 

general  Stokes’  theorem.  Thus  each  electronic  orbital  is  in  dynamic  equilibria  with  its 

adjacent ones. 

  We have found that the principle of rotation operation is closely connected with general 

Stokes’  theorem.  Since  Green’s  theorem,  Stokes’  theorem,  and  Gauss’  theorem  have  broad 

physical  implications  in  dynamics,  fluid  dynamics,  electromagnetism,  heat  conduction, 

thermodynamics, etc., one may explain electronic behavior in diverse physical manners. This 

discovery  opens  up  prospects  for  unifying  classic  mechanics  with  quantum  mechanics.  For 

example, 

∫ Φ

  is an integral about a closed circle and can be regarded as the circulation 

of  the  velocity  field  in  fluid  dynamics,  which  corresponds  to  Z-component  of  the  angular 

momentum of the electron described by colatitude quantum number in quantum mechanics.   

5.    Summary 

We  have  described  electronic  orbitals  in  neon  shell  in  reasonable  geometrical  details 

beyond  quantum  mechanics.  Electrons  are  oscillating  simultaneously  and  individually  in 

harmonic ways in four various dimensions: a 2px electron is one-dimensionally oriented; a 2py 

is 

tracking  along 

two-dimensional  semicircular  arc;  a  2p  electron  assembles  on 

three-dimensional hemispherical surface; and a 2s electron permeates over the entire atomic 

sphere  that  is  four-dimensional  in  quaternity  space.  These  four  space  dimensions  are  four 

diameters  that  electrons  are  traversing  via  their  corresponding  semicircular  arcs  during 

harmonic  oscillations.  It  is  interesting  that  electrons  track  along  the  circular  arcs,  but  their 

space  and  time  components  at  any  moment  are  measured  by  their  subtended  chords.  The 

space  and  time  components  of  the  electron  as  two sides  and  the  diametrical  dimension  as  a 

hypotenuse  always  form  a  right  triangle  so  that  Pythagorean  theorem  indeed  governs 

electronic motions in any cases.   

  We  have  identified  four  space  dimensions  in  neon  shell  as 

3l

, 

2l

, 

1l

,  and 

0l

  and 

established  their  mathematical  connections  with  conventional  Cartesian  coordinates  in 

differential  forms  (see  equations  11,  13,  15,  and  22)  as  well  as  in  integral  forms.  We 

summarize the integral definitions of four qauternity space dimensions under the context of 

electronic wavefunctions in neon shell.

These  equations  effectively  integrated  quaternity  space  definition  with  Cartesian  coordinate 

system and made it easy to understand from the conventional perspective. It was striking that 

Maxwell’s  equation,  general  Stokes’  theorem,  and  Pythagorean  theorem  boiled  down  to  the 

same law as the principle of rotation operation that we have proposed for electronic motions 

since our first report [2].   

Each electronic orbital is a continuous process driven by a radian angle rotation under the 

new  definition  of  dynamic  differentiation  and  all  electronic  processes  are  contiguous  in 

spacetime. Each electron is in equilibria with its adjacent ones. Electronic interaction obeys 

general  Stokes’  theorem  that  connotes  rich  physical  significances.  One  may  interpret 

electronic  behavior  as  many  ways  as  general  Stokes’  theorem  in  physical  applications.  This 

original article is a further exploration beyond the previous reports. Readers are encouraged to 

consult the previous article [1] and monograph [2] should any conceptual questions arise.

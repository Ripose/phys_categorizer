In this paper we present an analysis of information transfer time based on holomorphism, causality 
and the classical principle of stationary phase. We derive a common determination of transfer time 
for a range of pulse shapes and dispersive media in the absence of noise, and find our results are in 
accordance  with  those  from  the  application  of  Laplace  transform  theory  to  networks.  We  also 
make a preliminary study of the effect of noise on information transfer time, and find that noise 
tends to increase transfer times. Noise and information signals are both essentially acausal, such 
that analytic  continuation (i.e. prediction) is impossible, which  also implies that  their frequency 
spectra  cannot  be  holomorphic.  This  leads  to  the  paradox  of  a  non-holomorphic  information-
bearing light  signal,  yet  whose underlying Maxwell  equations governing the propagation  of  the 
EM  wave describe  a holomorphic  function  in  spacetime.  We  find  that application  of stationary 
phase and entropy arguments circumvents this difficulty, with stationary phase only suggesting the 
most likely transfer times of an information signal in the presence of noise. Faster transit times are 
not excluded, but are highly improbable. Stationary phase solutions, by definition, do not include 
signal  forerunners,  whose  detection  in  the  presence  of  noise  is  also  unreliable.  Hence  a  finite 
information  capacity  ensues,  as  expected  from  Shannon’s  law,  and  information  cannot  be 
transferred faster than c. We also find that the method of stationary phase implies complex transfer 
times. However, by considering spacetime to be isomorphic with the complex temporal plane, we 
find  that  an  imaginary  time  is  equivalent  to  a  real  distance,  and  can  be  interpreted  as  the 
uncertainty  in  the  spatial  position  of  the  information  pulse.  Finally,  we  apply  our  theory  to  a 
photonic  band  gap  crystal,  and  find  that  information  transfer  speed  and  tunneling  is  always 
subluminal. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Recent reports of slow [1] and fast [2] light have excited interest in the photonics community due to the implications 
for optical  information storage, optical  delay  lines, and  the possibility of  superluminal  data transmission.  In  this 
paper, we shall examine these non-traditional forms of light from an information theoretic point of view, since this is 
how these phenomena may ultimately find useful application. Previous theoretical work (which has been extensively 
reviewed  [3-5])  has  tended  to  employ  analytically-continuous  Gaussian,  or  infinite-bandwidth  step  pulses  to 
examine information velocity. However, Gaussian functions do not have a well-defined front, such that their speed 
of  propagation  becomes  ambiguous.  Also, infinite  bandwidth signals  cannot  propagate  through  any  real  physical 
medium  (whose  transfer  function  is  therefore  finite)  without  pulse  distortion,  which  also  leads  to  ambiguities  in 
determining propagation velocity.  
 
The use of Gaussian pulses in a dispersive medium has been extensively studied [6-9], often with the assumption 
that all the information is  in the leading edge of the pulse, thus allowing  analytic  continuation. Cauchy-Riemann 
theory has been extensively employed to analyse group velocity in dispersive media [10-12], with Chiao and co-
workers also studying an inverted medium (amplifier), where adiabaticity requires that the leading edge is amplified, 
whilst the trailing edge is suppressed [13]. However, the authors of the report of pulse transmission at 310 times the 
speed  of  light  employing  Gaussian  pulses  [2],  appear  to  disagree  that  superluminal  velocity  is  simply  due  to 
amplification  of  the  leading  edge  [14].  Diener [15]  also  makes  a  similar  approach  to  Chiao,  with  an  interesting 
discussion of Greens’ function, and energy storage by the amplifying medium. 

 
The use of a step-discontinuity to analyse signal speed was pioneered by Sommerfeld and Brillouin [10], who found 
that the step front travelled at the speed of light in vacuum c, via the forerunners, such that Einstein causality is not 
compromised. However, Nimtz [16] has pointed out that a step-discontinuity has infinite bandwidth, and so is not 
physically reasonable. Hence by inverting the argument, he makes the point that Einstein causality is only true for a 
well-defined  front;  but  since  this  does  not  exist  for  a  realistic  time-limited  signal,  this  might  leave  open  the 
possibility of superluminal velocity [17]. From an information theoretic viewpoint, he also invokes Shannon’s law 
[18], as a reason for a finite bandwidth requirement. 
 
All analyses tend to yield complex time delays, ultimately due to a complex propagation constant. This has caused a 
great deal of  confusion,  with  Landauer denying  the  physical  reality  to an  imaginary  time [19].  Analogous  to the 
propagation of EM radiation through a dispersive medium is the tunnelling of an electron through a potential barrier 
[20]. After  initial  studies by  Wigner  [21], Büttiker has made  important  contributions  to electron tunnelling times 
[22],  and  with  Landauer,  also  to  photon  tunnelling  times  [23].  They  make  an  interesting  discussion  of  the 
compromise between a narrow bandwidth pulse (and therefore very long in spatial extent), and the position of the 
centre of gravity of pulse: an aspect of the uncertainty principle. Fertig also comes to similar conclusions [24], thus 
highlighting  another  problem  with  the  “fast”  light  experiment  [2].  Leavens  and  Aers  [25,26]  consider  real  and 
imaginary  times  to  be  simply  “barrier  interaction  parameters  with  the  dimensions  of  time”,  but  do  not  give  a 
physical meaning to complex time. They also discuss the additive properties of complex time. Sokolovski considers 
the concept of complex times to be an analogue to the Young’s Twin Slit experiment [27]. Krausz and co-workers 
have performed experiments on photon tunnelling [28], and found that, in agreement with Hartman [29], tunnelling 
time does not depend on barrier thickness. 
 
Recently,  the  effects  of  noise  on  signal  velocity  have  also  started  to  be  examined  [30],  and  Aharanov discusses 
quantum  limitations  and noise  in  superluminal  propagation  [31]. Finally, Chiao  and co-workers  have been  using 
photon pairs to measure transfer times, but the stochastic nature of light becomes evident under these conditions, and 
questions of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement and the associated paradoxes make the results difficult to 
unambiguously interpret [32-36]. 
 
2. Ubiquity of Holomorphic Functions 
In an important paper by Toll [37], it was found that a function, which is causal  in time, has a holomorphic [38] 
Fourier transform  (FT).  That  is  to  say,  its  frequency  components,  when  analysed  across  the  complex  frequency 
plane,  are  holomorphic  (i.e.  analytic,  or holographic) in  nature,  and  obey  the  Cauchy-Riemann  equations.  Toll’s 
paper can be further generalised, such that any function which is zero (or can be considered zero) from some point 
back to minus infinity on the real axis, will have a holomorphic FT. Thus any ‘windowed’ or ‘apertured’ function 
has  a  holomorphic  FT.  It  is  well  known  that  the  free-space  far-field  (Fraunhofer)  diffraction  pattern  of  light  is 
mathematically  equivalent  to  the  FT  of  the  original  aperture.  Hence,  the  resulting  interference  pattern  from  the 
Young’s twin-slit experiment is holomorphic. Reflection and transmission coefficients are given by  the FT of the 
finite spatial distribution of scatterers (bounded in spatial extent) [39], such that they too are holomorphic. Thus both 
transverse and longitudinal grating structures scatter light holomorphically.  
 
The  Maxwell  equations  are  a  form  of  the Cauchy-Riemann  equations,  such that EM radiation  is  holomorphic in 
spacetime. We demonstrate this for one space and one time dimension, although we begin with Maxwell’s equations 
in 3+1 dimensions:

where the displacement is  D Ee=
 where B 
is the magnetic flux density,  m is the permeability, and H is the magnetic field strength;  r  is the charge density, and 
J is the current density. For an EM field in an isotropic dielectric medium, without any sources or free charges etc., 
we can assume that

which are the classical 2-dimensional form of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Hence we can assume that the electric 
field E and the magnetic field H (which is simply proportional to A) together form a holomorphic function1, so that 
the overall holomorphic function is  F E jHZ
, and the space and time coordinates make up the complex plane z, 
such that  z
 
In  our  physical  universe,  negative  frequencies  cannot  be  directly  measured.  Only  by  frequency-shifting  (i.e. 
multiplexing onto a positive high-frequency carrier wave) do they become positive, so that they can be (somewhat 
indirectly)  ‘observed’.  We  have  here  an  analogous  ‘frequency-causality’  in  the  frequency  domain,  where  the 
frequency spectrum is immeasureable (to all intents equal to zero) for negative frequencies. Since the EM signal is 
holomorphic in spacetime due to the Maxwell equations, Toll’s paper [37] requires it to be ‘causal’ in its (inverse) 
FT  space,  i.e.  in  its  frequency  (reciprocal,  or  Hilbert)  space.  Hence,  we  can  see  that  the  holomophic  Maxwell 
equations, by definition, require the non-measurability of negative frequencies. In passing, we note that the Hilbert 
space  of  2-D  spacetime  is  defined  by  a  spatial-frequency  on  the  real  axis,  and  temporal-frequency  along  the 
imaginary axis. Thus we now notice that a causal EM wave is both holomorphic in the complex frequency plane, 
and  also  in  spacetime. Applying  Occam’s Razor to  the situation  in  a  quest  for simplicity, we make  the  complex 
frequency  plane,  and  the  Hilbert  space  of  2-D  spacetime  isomorphic  with  one  another;  and  hence  also  make 
spacetime  equivalent  to  the  complex  time  plane.  In  which  case,  without  altering  the  underlying  mathematical 
arguments above, we  find  that an imaginary time  is  equivalent to real space, with a  similar equivalence for their 
reciprocal spaces. 
 
Finally, we note that holomorphic functions contain within themselves the essence of a wave-particle duality, since 
they have both global and local properties. Holomorphic functions are completely defined over the whole complex 
plane;  yet can also be fully defined from any  arbitrary point in the complex plane, by use of the Cauchy integral 
theorem and summation of an unconditionally convergent Taylor’s series [40]. Thus any single point in the complex 
plane contains all the information required to completely reconstruct the holomorphic function over all space. Dual 
(i.e. complementary) descriptions to fully  characterise  a holomorphic  function  thus exist, and the similarities to  a 
“hologram”  are  obvious.  Hence  we  see  that  the  Maxwell  equations,  although  developed  as  a  set  of  EM  wave 
equations, because of their holomorphic nature, also implicitly describe a localised photon in spacetime. 
 
3. Non-Holomorphic Functions: Information and Noise 
A holomorphic function has the property that it is infinitely redundant, i.e. the function can be defined over all space 
merely by appropriate continuation (i.e. by infinite differentiation, and infinite Taylor’s series) of an arbitrary point 
on the  function. A  Gaussian  function  is  holomorphic, which is  why  its ‘leading edge’ can be  used to  define  the 
complete function; hence the explanation for the “superluminal” velocity observed for such a signal in an inverted 
medium: the principle of analytic continuity. Thus we argue that no information transfer actually takes place when a 
holomorphic signal is used to ‘transmit’ information from A to B, since such a signal is completely defined over all 
space and so is already completely defined at the destination point B. Hence there is a zero time delay (and infinite 
velocity) to ‘transfer’ the signal. Instead, only non-holomorphic signals can be used to transmit information, since 
they  are  by  definition  not  defined  over  all  space.  This  is  intuitively  reasonable,  since  we  often  associate  an 
information signal with a discontinuous function, which cannot be analytic and allow ‘prediction’. 
 
By inverting the argument of Toll’s paper [37], a non-holomorphic information-bearing signal contains the implicit 
assumption  of  acausality.  However,  noise  also  has  this  characteristic,  since  it  is  unpredictable,  and  tends  to  be 
acausal (e.g. spontaneous emission); but it contains no information. So, how do we tell the difference between pure 
noise, and a high-information bearing signal, since both signals have the superficial appearance of noise? As can be 
derived from Gödel’s incompleteness theorem, and Turing’s halting/indecidability problem [41], we find that there 
can exist no  finite and deterministic algorithm, which can  decide whether any given signal is random (i.e. purely 
noise), or rich in information. In addition, the amount of information in a given signal cannot be deterministically 
calculated [42,43], which further makes a definitive information transfer rate or time difficult to assess.  

                                                   
1 As might be expected, the full 3+1-dimensional Maxwell equations also form the appropriate Cauchy-Riemann 
equations for a 4-dimensional manifold. 

Since  the  solutions  to  wave  propagation  equations  tend  to  involve  FT  quantities,  we  find  that  wave  function 
solutions are holomorphic in nature. A wave equation solution can also be regarded as the distribution of amplitudes 
and  phases  (i.e.  the  probability  distribution)  indicating  the  range  of  state  possibilities  available  to  a  particle. 
However,  when  a  measurement  is  made  on  the  position  (for  example)  of  an  individual  particle,  after  the 
measurement, the particle is found in only one of those possible states. The ‘distribution’ function of that particle 
after  the  measurement  is  now  similar  to  a  Dirac  delta  function  –  it  has  been  localised.  The  wave  function  has 
collapsed, or decohered after the measurement [44]; and as a result it is also now non-holomorphic. The decohered, 
non-holomorphic wave function now bears information, in the form of telling us where the particle is situated [45]. 
Thus  a  measurement  is  associated  with  the  transformation  of  a  holomorphic  function  into  a  non-holomorphic 
function. In so doing, information is exchanged. 
 
Thus information has analogies with a field or particle, since it can propagate, and be exchanged. Information also 
tends to be associated with entropy [46-48]. They are often considered to be negatively correlated, e.g. Brillouin’s 
concept  of  negentropy  (i.e.  negative  entropy)  as  an  alternative  measure  for  information  [49].  We  can  therefore 
ascribe  a  physical  difference  between  ‘real’  and  ‘virtual’  processes:  A  real  process  (such  as  a  measurement)  is 
associated with an exchange of information and a change in entropy; whereas a virtual process is associated with no 
information  exchange  and  sees  no  change  in  entropy.  In  many  of  the  ‘superluminal’  experiments  employing 
Gaussian pulses, adiabaticity is assumed due to the smoothness of the pulse, such that there is no change in entropy; 
in  which  case  no  information  is  transferred.  As  noted  above,  an  information-bearing  signal  will  tend  to  have 
discontinuities  or  abrupt  changes,  such  that  non-adiabatic  processes  occur,  and  entropy  changes  accompany  the 
pulse  through  an  active  medium.  This  is  in  accord  with  the  concept  that  reversible  computation,  i.e.  processing 
(without loss) of information, doesn’t require energy or a change in entropy, whereas erasure of information requires 
energy and is accompanied by a change in entropy [48]. Transfer of information from A to B can be understood to 
be the annihilation of the information at A, proceeded by the re-creation of that same information at B. 
 
4. Stationary Phase and Holomorphic Functions 
The principle of stationary phase to describe the group velocity is well known, and was employed by Sommerfeld 
and Brillouin in their early studies of wave propagation and group velocity [10]. The principle of stationary phase 
can also be used  in a  statistical sense, such that the most likely  events  tend to be associated with slowly-varying 
phase variation in the frequency domain, and unlikely events tend to be associated with rapidly varying phase with 
frequency. Hence the principle of stationary phase can be used to predict the most likely outcome of an experiment, 
but it doesn’t exclude the possibility of alternative outcomes. When applied to information transfer, it predicts the 
most likely speed at which information can be transmitted, but allows  the possibility of  superluminal information 
velocity, albeit with only a low probability. Trying to  transmit information at such superluminal speeds therefore 
necessarily  means  a  severe  degradation  in  the  quality  of  that  information,  since  only  a  small  proportion  of  that 
information  will  be  successfully  transmitted.  In  which  case,  error-correcting  techniques  need  to  be  employed  to 
reconstruct  the  information  at  the  far end. This  is  at the  expense  of the apriori  requirement of  a  large degree  of 
redundancy in the original information signal (i.e. akin to making it holomorphic!), and also processing time at the 
receiving end; in which case it is questionable whether truly superluminal information transmission has then been 
achieved. 
 
 When considering the principle of stationary phase along the real frequency axis, we assume that a wave can be

4.1 Lossy & Amplifying Media, and Classically Forbidden Regions 
For a complex-valued propagation constant 
, associated with a complex-valued refractive index (e.g. 
i
for lossy and amplifying media, or a classically forbidden region), equation (5) cannot be directly evaluated (except 
via a Jacobean which only gives a modulus result), and equation (7) yields a complex-valued relative time delay. 
Sommerfeld and Brillouin used contour integration in the complex frequency plane to analyse the propagation of a 
signal through an absorptive medium. The complex frequency plane is described by 
, where  w  is the 
(conventional) frequency along the real axis, and  u  is frequency along the imaginary frequency axis. The phase of 
the  propagating  wave  is  thus  a  function  of  w)   in  the  complex  frequency  plane,  and  consists  of  both  real  and

Thus  the  relative  time  delay  is  simply  given  by  the  frequency-derivative  of  the  logarithmic  complex  transfer 
function  of  the  medium.  We have  derived  this expression  for the relative  time delay using  only  the principle  of 
stationary phase along both real and imaginary frequency axes, and invoking causality. Often, only the delay due to 
the  variation  of  phase  with  frequency  is  calculated  for  the  group  delay,  as  the  transmission  amplitude  at  the 
frequency  of  interest  is  often  almost  constant,  or  is  at  a  maximum  (i.e.  as  close  to  100%  as  possible),  e.g.  the 
transmission  of  a  Fabry-Perot  resonator,  or  a  low-loss  data  transmission  line.  Conventional  complex-number 
calculations  of  phase  variation  with  frequency  (and  hence  time  delay)  make  the  implicit  assumption  of 
monochromatic stimulation, which is non-information bearing. However, analysis of the dispersive character of any 
real  medium  shows  straightforwardly  that  non-monochromatic  signals  suffer  varying  time  delay.  This  translates 
directly to pulse shape distortion in the time domain (the essence of dispersion). Chirped-frequency evaluation of 
media  is  also  well  known  to  produce  distorted  envelopes  as  a  function  of  chirp  time.  These  common-place 
observations support the arguments advanced for an imaginary time delay component, based on amplitude variation 
as well as phase variation. 
 
The complex time delay produced using equation (17) has the conventional time delay as its real part, but also an 
interesting  Hilbert  transform  pair  as  the  imaginary  part.  Analogous  equations  have  been  derived  for  electron 
tunnelling  times  associated  with  a  low  probability  of  transmission,  such  that  Leavens  and  Aers  [26]  have  also 
written the transfer time as:

4.3 Dependence of Time Delay on Noise 
¶ ,  but  this  is  generally  under  the  implicit 
From  filter  theory  the  time  (group)  delay  is  given  by 
assumption of a lossless and noiseless channel. It might be expected that a lossy and noisy channel will exhibit a 
different group delay characteristic. There are various aspects to defining the time taken to transmit a signal through 
a  channel.  Using  heuristic  arguments,  we  demonstrate  that  the  definition  of  time  taken  to  transmit  a  signal 
(consisting of a single pulse) a distance L from A to B depends on the amount of noise in the channel, assuming 
finite channel transmission:

a) 

If there were no noise, then theoretically speaking, a detector could unambiguously detect a signal by the 
presence of the Sommerfeld/Brillouin forerunners, which travel at a speed c through the channel. Thus in 
this  case,  the  time delay  to  transfer  information would simply  be 
, since  we  can  assume  that

b)  If  there  were  some  system  noise,  then  the  earliest  time  for  ‘unambiguous’  detection  of  a  pulse  of 
information would be when the amplitude of the signal first rises above that of the noise. This is a slower

We  note  that  there  are  also  timing  information  issues,  which  we  have  ignored,  were  the  signal  to  consist  of  a 
sequence of pulses. If the signal power is reduced such that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is reduced, then the time 
delay will also tend to increase, so that we expect an attenuating channel to delay a signal by an extra amount. Thus 
the  amplitude  response  of  the  channel  (as  well  as  its  phase  response) determines  the  time  delay  of  a  signal,  as 
indicated  by  equation  (17).  A  slower  information  transfer  time  due  to  the  presence  of  noise  is  equivalent  to  a 
reduction in the channel transmission bandwidth, since the quantity of useful information transmitted per unit time is 
therefore lowered. This is in agreement with Shannon’s information capacity theorem [18]. 
 
 
 
5. Application of Theory  
5.1 Simple Filter Transmission Functions 
To  indicate  the  utility  of  equation  (17),  we  apply  it  to  some  well-understood  generalised  low-order  frequency 
response functions. Unfortunately no propagation constant or length parameter is associated with these transmission 
functions  as  they  are  highly  abstracted.  This  makes  it  is  difficult  to  assign  an  appropriate  real  length  with  the 
imaginary time delay for these network functions, since they do not have any physical size parameters. However, in 
general, the temporal distribution of a pulse can be straightforwardly regarded as a physical length by involving the 
propagation velocity of the pulse. In which case, the imaginary time delay can be understood to indicate uncertainty 
in the spatial pulse position through the network. In the next section 5.2, we consider light transmission through a 
photonic crystal, which does have complete physical parameterisation. A first order low-pass  filter can be simply 
described by the function:

For low frequencies, well below cut-off, the time delay is close to  1t  (as expected from Laplace transform theory) 
and the imaginary component is negligible. However, at the cut-off frequency associated with the filter, 
, 
the time delay is given by: 

t=
11/

w

such that the imaginary time delay is as large as the conventional time delay. In fact, the imaginary time delay is 
maximised at the cut-off frequency (i.e. the band edge), which coincides with a region of high dispersion. In general, 
regions  of  high  dispersion  are  associated  with  large  imaginary  time  delays.  As  the  frequency  increases  towards 
infinity, and the transmission becomes ever closer to zero, the imaginary component to the group delay dominates 
over the  real  time delay,  yet also decreases  inversely  proportionally  to  the  frequency. At  these  high  frequencies, 
there is very little probability of transmission, but the time delay associated with any transmitted portion of the wave 
is also extremely small, such that the propagation is almost as if it where through vacuum. However, the real time is 
always positive for all frequencies, in which case the transfer time is always subluminal. 
 
A 2nd-order bandstop filtering action with a finite Q value (analogous to that of a finite photonic crystal described 
below in section 5.2) is described by

included in equation (22a), with a putative length L assumed for the network, then the overall real group delay is 
always greater than or equal to zero. As the frequency gets large and tends towards infinity, the real component of 
2w - , whilst the imaginary component tends towards zero with only 
the time delay of (22b) tends towards zero as 
1w - , such that the propagation is almost as if it where through vacuum. However, as for the first-order filter, the real 
time remains positive for all frequencies, such that the transmission time is always subluminal. 
 
Transfer functions (21a) and (22a) can be straightforwardly rewritten in the Laplace s-plane, where  s

inverse  Laplace  transform  determined,  which  essentially  gives  the  causal  time  domain  response.  However,  the

depending  on  the  relative  damping  of  the  medium,  the  leading  edge  or  precursor  can  show  non-monotonic 
behaviour.  Application  of  equation  (17)  to  the  transfer  function  in  the  complex-frequency  plane  yields  an 
unambiguous  time  delay  for  each  frequency.  A  pulse  with  a  temporal  distribution

In passing, we note that the holomorphic nature of a causal transmission function  ( )

of light, which by definition cannot be halted in spacetime, according to the holomorphic Maxwell equations (and 
also Einstein’s axiom.) Hence the concept of an all-pass filter (APF), which assumes 100% (constant) transmission 
over a continuous band of frequencies, is physically unrealisable.

information-bearing signal has a  finite  bandwidth, and since the  group  delay  is  zero  for only  the  Bragg resonant

(i.e.  the frequency average of equation 30) is as expected 
case) analysis, we  can  assume  that  the presence  of noise  will  slow  the signal still  further. Hence,  for a photonic 
band-gap, where tunnelling occurs, we find that information transfer speed is always subluminal. 
 
Conclusions 
In this paper we have considered information transfer times over perspectives ranging from holomorphic functions, 
filter transfer functions, and Shannon capacity theory, to standard causal Laplacian formalisms. A stationary phase 
approach  has  been  shown  to  be  beneficial  in  resolving  the  paradox  of  information  bearing  and  holomorphic 
functions  in  the  presence  of  noise.  We  also  conclude  that  information  transfer  is  accompanied  by  a  change  in 
entropy  of  the  system.  In  the  general  case,  dispersive  effects  in  a  causal  medium  manifest  themselves  by  the 
presence of an imaginary component to the group delay, which conspires to prevent accurate measurement of transit 
time. The real and imaginary time delays make a Hilbert transform pair, such that the imaginary time delay can be 
physically  understood  to  be  a  real  spatial  length  in  spacetime.  In  relatively  non-dispersive  regions,  such  as  the 
extrema and band-centre of resonant media, we have found that a positive real time delay is always predicted. We 
have studied light propagation through a photonic band gap device, and have shown that superluminal velocity (i.e. 
faster than conventional speed of light in the medium, c/n) is indeed possible in the resonant condition, but with two 
caveats:  firstly  the transmission (or tunnelling probability) is negligible; and secondly  the maximum velocity  can 
still only approach that of vacuum, but not exceed it. We also note that the presence of noise in the transmission 
system will tend to slow the information transfer time, in accordance with Shannon’s theorem.

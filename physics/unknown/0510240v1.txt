Abstract.  Universe  structure  emerges  in  the  unreduced,  complex-dynamic  interaction  process  with  the  simplest  initial 
configuration (two attracting homogeneous fields). The unreduced interaction analysis, avoiding any perturbative model, 
gives intrinsically creative cosmology describing the real, explicitly emerging world structure with dynamic randomness 
on each scale. Without imposing any postulates or additional entities, we obtain physically real, three-dimensional space, 
irreversibly flowing time, elementary particles with their detailed structure and intrinsic properties, causally complete and 
unified  version  of  quantum  and  relativistic  behaviour,  the  origin  and  number  of  naturally  unified  fundamental  forces, 
classical behaviour emergence in a closed system, and true quantum chaos. Major problems of standard cosmology and 
astrophysics are consistently solved in this extended picture, including those of quantum cosmology and gravity, entropy 
growth  and  time  arrow,  “hierarchy”  of  elementary  particles  (Planckian  unit  values),  “anthropic”  difficulties,  Big  Bang 
contradictions, and “missing” (“dark”) mass and energy. Universality of the proposed theory is explicitly expressed by 
the symmetry (conservation) of dynamic complexity providing the unified, irregular, but exact (never “broken”) Order of 
the World that underlies all universe structures, phenomena, and laws.

1.  COMPLEX-DYNAMIC VS STANDARD COSMOLOGY 

Contrary to experimental, observational successes in modern astro-physics, the explanatory power of respective 
cosmological theories remains limited, so that the number of unsolved problems only grows, while those considered 
to be “solved” often resemble rather a “plausibly” looking adjustment of artificially introduced, abstract entities and 
free parameters (see e.g. [1], as well as the present conference materials). Without entering into detailed discussion 
of those difficulties, we only note here a possible general origin of such situation, which is inherent in the general 
scholar  science  approach,  but  has  particularly  strong  manifestations  in  cosmology.  As  it  was  first  emphasized  by 
Bergson  [2]  and  confirmed  by  further  science  development  (see  e.g.  [3]),  conventional  science  methods  do  not 
describe  explicit  structure  emergence  as  such,  but  are  limited  instead  to  postulation  of  already  existing  structure 
configuration,  properties,  and  simplified,  imitative  “evolution”  (in  the  form  of  empirically  guessed  “laws”, 
“principles”, “models”, etc.). Whereas such description can be useful in the study of simple, easily measurable and 
“smoothly”  evolving  objects  (the  canonical  case  of  “Newtonian  mechanics”),  it  should  be  much  less  efficient  in 
explanation of the origin and dynamics of systems, such as the universe, that cannot be simply “postulated” with all 
their observed properties because they undergo strong, qualitative changes of configuration (explicit emergence of 
structure) involving many diverse, hierarchically organised and entangled elements. 

In other words, the true cosmology should be able to describe the unreduced, explicit formation of a complicated 
structure, which just remains obscure in the usual theory framework. A related difficulty of the latter is that it cannot 
consistently,  rigorously  solve  any  realistic,  many-body  interaction  problem,  always  resorting  to  one  or  another 
simplified  “model”  or  “perturbative”  approximation, whereas  it  is  just  that  unreduced,  “nonintegrable”  interaction 
process that underlies any real structure formation. In particular, standard theory cannot provide the unambiguous, 
universal  origin  of  the  major  property  of  mass  (and  energy),  operating  instead  with  its  measurable  inertial  and 
gravitational  manifestations.  Although  this  problem  could  remain  among  “less  practically  important”  ones  in 
“Newtonian” science, the difficulties with strangely “invisible”, “dark” mass and energy have “suddenly” emerged 
now on the global scale as quite important, if not fatal, defects of the whole conventional world picture.

A.P. Kirilyuk 

In  this  report  we  describe  a  new,  qualitatively  extended  cosmology  framework  based  on  the  unreduced,  truly 
“exact”  solution  of  arbitrary  interaction  problem  that  gives  explicit  emergence  of  real  world  structures  and 
properties,  without  any  artificial  simplification  and  leads  to  the  rigorously  derived,  truly  universal  concept  of 
dynamic complexity [4-17]. This unreduced dynamic complexity is different from the existing mechanistic imitations 
of  “complexity”  in  the  conventional  theory  and  unifies  qualitatively  extended  versions  of  dynamical  chaos,  self-
organisation, self-organised criticality, “synchronisation”, “chaos control”, fractality, adaptability,  etc. 

We start with showing how all the fundamental universe entities and properties, including physically specified 
space and time, elementary particles, their properties, interactions and dynamics, explicitly emerge in the provably 
simplest  initial  configuration  of  interaction  process,  comprising  two  structureless,  omnipresent,  physically  real 
fields, homogeneously attracted to each other (section 2). It is important that we obtain together the main entities 
(space,  time,  particles),  their  properties  (space  structure  and  number  of  dimensions,  irreversible  time  flow,  mass-
energy,  charge,  spin,  interactions),  and  dynamical  laws  (quantum  and  relativistic  behaviour)  within  the  same, 
intrinsically unified concept of complexity, using a rigorous derivation procedure and no additional, postulated laws 
or  entities  besides  the  evidently  “minimal”  starting  interaction  configuration  (section  3).  We  show  then  how  the 
naturally emerging, truly dynamic properties of complexity and chaoticity give rise to all higher-level structures and 
solve the difficulties of the conventional theory that neglects those major features because of its artificial reduction 
and therefore loses the essence of such basic properties as mass and energy (sections 4, 5). 

We emphasize the intrinsically unified and reality-based character of the proposed solution to all the main, quite 
diverse problems of the usual theory, consistently derived simply due to the unreduced, universally nonperturbative 
analysis of an arbitrary (generic) interaction problem, which confirms the power of genuine, unreduced science and 
reveals  the  exact  origin  of  the  standard  theory  limitations  and  difficulties  as  its  dynamically  single-valued,  zero-
complexity approximation that neglects all really emerging system realisations except a single, “averaged” one. The 
ultimate,  mathematically  exact  expression  of  the  obtained  unification  is  provided  by  the  universal  symmetry,  or 
conservation, of complexity, which determines the emergence and dynamics of all universe structures and therefore 
constitutes the genuine, unique Order of the World (section 2) [4-6]. 

2.  UNIVERSE STRUCTURE EMERGENCE AS A RESULT 

OF UNREDUCED INTERACTION PROCESS 

No  structure  can  emerge  without  interaction.  Consistent  universe  structure  formation  should  start  from  the 
simplest  possible  (least  structured)  interaction  configuration,  which  is  still  able  to  produce  explicitly  the  observed 
real  structures.  The  most  structureless  configuration  of  a  physically  real  system  with  interaction  is  given  by  two 
homogeneous (effectively structureless), uniformly interacting entities represented by two physically real fields, or 
protofields,  which are attracted to each other and whose detailed composition (of sufficiently small elements) does 
not play the key role in the following structure formation [4,5,11-17]. Interaction between protofields supposes their 
different physical qualities designated as gravitational protofield (or medium) and electromagnetic (e/m) protofield, 
since  we  show  later  that  they  are  responsible  for  the  emerging  (and  universally  present)  gravitational  and  e/m 
interactions,  respectively.  The  physically  real  protofields  are  omnipresent  and  therefore  cannot  be  related  to  any 
postulated (let alone “hidden” and abstract) spatial “dimensions”, time “variables”, other mathematical “structures”, 
laws, etc., none of which may have a sense at this initial stage (cf. recent imitations within so-called “brane-world” 
scenarios of the unitary theory [18-20]). Extended, complex-dynamical and physically real versions of those entities 
and laws are consistently derived in our theory starting from the existence equation that describes the above simplest 
protofield interaction without any limitation or model assumption [4-6,11-17]:

eventually take the form of various, including “nonlinear”, “model” equations (although we show below, in a self-
consistent way, that its “Hamiltonian” form is indeed absolutely universal [4-6,11-17]).

If, however, we avoid any perturbative reduction of system (3) and try to find its unreduced solution by the method 
of substitution using the standard Green function technique, we arrive at problem formulation in terms of generalised 
optical,  or  effective,  potential  (EP)  [4-17,21,22].  The  latter  is  a  well-known  method,  but  used  in  its  reduced, 
perturbative version (see e.g. [21]). Direct analysis of the unreduced EP expression shows that the original problem 
has the redundant number of locally “complete” and thus mutually incompatible (but equally real) solutions called 
system and problem realisations [4-17,22]. Therefore the truly complete general solution to a problem is given, in 
),qρ ξ  (generalising other measured quantities), by the causally probabilistic sum over 
terms of system “density” 
redundant realisations, which permanently replace one another in a dynamically random order thus defined:

Plurality of locally complete solutions of eq. (9), or dynamic multivaluedness of the unreduced problem, giving 
rise  to  the  major  property  of  causal  randomness,  eq.  (7),  follows  from  the  self-consistent,  dynamically  emerging, 
essentially nonlinear, dependence of the unreduced EP, eq. (10), on the eigen-solutions to be found [4-17]. We thus 
obtain also the dynamically derived, a priori probability

where 
r   is  the  number  of  “elementary  realisations”  obtained  above  and  entering  the  r-th  actually  observed, 
compound  realisation.  Note  that  usual,  perturbative  models  of  eqs.  (5)-(6)  correspond  to  rejection  of  all  system 
realisations  but  a  single,  “averaged”  one.  We  call  this  property  of  canonical,  “exact”  solutions  dynamic  single-
valuedness and the whole standard theory reduction dynamically single-valued, or unitary, solution and approach. 

Another  major  property  of  the  unreduced  solution  closely  related  to  dynamic  multivaluedness  is  dynamic 
entanglement  of  interacting  system  components  (protofields  in  this  case),  expressed  by  the  dynamically  weighted 
,qξ )  in  the 
products  of  different  component  eigenfunctions  depending  on  their  respective  “degrees  of  freedom”  (
unreduced state-function expression, eq. (8). Dynamic entanglement provides the physical meaning of interaction as 
such,  as  well  as  the  rigorous  expression  of  tangible  quality  of  interaction  products,  absent  in  any  unitary  theory 
describing only an abstract, external “envelope” of a real structure. The property of dynamic entanglement is further 
amplified  by  that  of  dynamically  probabilistic  fractality  of  the  unreduced  solution,  which  extends  essentially  the 
ordinary, dynamically single-valued fractality and is obtained by repeated use of the same, universal EP method in 
order  to  solve  truncated  systems  of  equations,  starting  from  eqs.  (11),  whose  solutions  enter  the  expressions  for 
previous level of structure (see eqs. (8), (10)) [4,8]. One obtains thus the whole hierarchy of not only entangled, but 
permanently,  probabilistically,  interactively  changing  and  thus  dynamically  adapting  realisations  of  the  emerging 
system structure, which is a major property of real structure formation processes, absent in their unitary imitations. 

It  is  not  difficult  to  find  the  emerging  local  realisation  configuration for  two  attracting,  initially  homogeneous 
protofields [4,5,10,11,13,17]. The resonant-denominator structure of the state-function and EP expressions, eqs. (8), 
(10),  in  combination  with  “cutting”  integrals  in  the  numerators,  shows  that  the  magnitude  of  the  state-function 
iη  for that realisation, 
components for each particular (r-th) realisation is concentrated around certain eigenvalue

which  can  be  conveniently  designated  as 
rη   and  interpreted  as  the  centre  of  dynamically  emerging,  local 
concentration  of  the  attracting  protofield  density,  or  emerging  physical  space  point  and  its  coordinate.  This  local 
dynamical squeeze of the initially totally homogeneous protofield system appears to be inevitable physically, for the 
real,  unreduced  interaction  dynamics:  every  small,  local  density  increase  of  a  protofield  will  provoke  a  self-
amplifying  chain  of  further  density  increase  of  both  protofields  around  that  location  because  the  larger  is  the 
protofield  density,  the  stronger  is  their  attraction  at  a  given  place.  That  omnipresent  dynamic  instability  of  the 
unreduced  protofield  interaction,  accompanied  and  assisted  by  the  above  dynamic  entanglement,  is  absent  in  any 
unitary approximation, cutting the emerging interaction links and therefore predicting only small deviations from the 
initial  configuration.  In  the  unreduced  analysis  it  leads  to  maximum  local  squeeze,  or  dynamic  reduction,  of  the 
attracting protofields  around  a  location, or  (emerging) physical  point, which  is  chosen  among  other  neighbouring, 
equally  probable  locations  in  a  causally  (dynamically)  random  way,  in  full  agreement  with  the  above  rigorously 
derived  expressions  for  realisation  structure  and  probability,  eqs.  (8),  (10),  (12).  Maximum  squeeze  of  entangled 
protofields, determining the fully developed structure of a “regular” system realisation, is limited by finite protofield 
compressibility, and is naturally followed by the reverse process of protofield disentanglement and extension to the 
initial,  quasi-homogeneous  state,  which  is  initiated  and  governed  by  the  same  system  instability  as  the  previous 
phase of reduction. 

One obtains thus the emerging, physically specified and totally real dynamical structure of (massive) elementary 
particle, such as the electron, in the form of unceasing periodic cycles of local dynamic reduction and extension of 
two attracting protofields, where the centre of each next reduction is chosen by the system in a dynamically (truly) 
random fashion. We call this explicitly emerging, internally entangled, permanently changing, and spatially chaotic 
particle  structure  quantum  beat  process  [4,5,11-17].  Its  reality  is  confirmed  by  the  properties  of  the  unreduced 
solution  within  the  generalised  EP  formalism,  eqs.  (7)-(12).  In  particular,  the  latter  contains  not  only  the  locally 
squeezed  structure  of  “regular”  realisations  described  above,  but  also  one  specific,  extended  realisation  with  a 
“loose”, chaotically fluctuating structure that describes the disentangled system state during transition between two 
squeezed, “regular” realisations. It is this transient state called intermediate, or “main”, realisation that corresponds 
to effectively weak interaction value of a perturbative approximation (eqs. (5)-(6)) and constitutes the physically real 
particle  wavefunction,  which  represents  the  totally  causal,  physically  real  extension  of  the  unitary  quantum 
wavefunction (artificially mystified because of dynamically single-valued “modelling”) and can be further extended, 
due  to  the  unrestricted  universality  of  our  analysis,  to  any  kind  of  system  and  level  of  world  dynamics  (where  it 
takes also the form of generalised distribution function) [4-6,12-17]. This physically real, interaction-driven duality 
between  squeezed  and  extended state/phase  of  the quantum beat  process  within  the  elementary  particle  evokes  its 
another definition as elementary field-particle [4,5,11-17].

.    It  is  the  length  of  the  elementary,  real  quantum  jump  of  the 
unreduced  EP  formalism,  eqs.  (9)-(10), 
squeezed,  “corpuscular”  state  of  the  particle,  or  virtual  soliton,  between  its  two  regular  realisations  within  the 
quantum beat process, equal to the Compton length  Cλ , 
 [4,5,11-17]. Another characteristic length 
scale, determining the size of the virtual soliton, or “particle” (electron) as such, is given by the generic eigenvalue 
= (see also section 3.2). We 
separation 
thus obtain the physically real, naturally discrete, dynamically entangled, and chaotically changing space. Since we 
have obtained the well-defined events of dynamic reduction-extension, we can define the physically real time, whose 
unceasing flow is derived as permanent realisation change of dynamically multivalued protofield interaction process 
(quantum beat), intrinsic irreversibility is provided by the dynamically random sequence of realisations (reduction 
 is the above space element 
centres), and elementary interval, 
and  c  is  the  speed  of  perturbation  propagation  in  the  e/m  protofield  interacting  with  the  gravitational  protofield

A  big  number  of  different  elementary  field-particles  will  emerge  in  the  described  way  in  the  initially 
homogeneous  system  of  two  interacting  protofields.  This  follows  from  the  same  basic  property  of  dynamic 
multivaluedness  and  its  hierarchical  fractal  structure.  Local  quantum  beat  processes  can  have  several  major 
realisations with essentially different EP magnitude, where relatively small amplitudes form (compound) realisation 
of  lighter  particles  (leptons)  with  weaker  relation  to  the  gravitational  protofield,  while  much  larger  amplitudes 
constitute hadron realisations with essential entanglement of e/m and gravitational protofields. Each of such “big” 
compound realisations of the first level of interaction structure can contain various particle subspecies and ends up in 
splitting into numerous individual particles, situated at different (emerging) locations and represented by a certain 
level  of  fractal  hierarchy  of  dynamic  multivaluedness,  described  above  as  quantum  beat  process  within  each

(massive) particle. Higher levels of (weaker) interaction between these entities of the first complexity level start then 
naturally emerge (see below), but the factor of deep cosmological importance at this and higher levels of structure 
emergence  is  their intrinsic, dynamic  adaptability  determined  by  the self-consistent dependence of  the unreduced, 
nonperturbative EP, eqs. (8)-(10), on the emerging structure parameters (exemplified by eigenvalues η). Thus, any 
new particle emergence increases the protofield tension, and when the latter is high enough, no more particles can 
form (for a given interaction  magnitude). Therefore the protofield interaction strength dynamically determines the 
number (mass density) of particles in the universe. One obtains thus a self-tuning universe that avoids, simply due to 
its  unrestricted  interaction  problem  solution,  any  “anthropic”  problems  or  “catastrophically  adjusted”  universal 
constants [4,5,11-13,17] (see also sections 3.2, 3.3). 

The quantity of dynamic complexity as such of any real interaction process and emerging structure can now be 
universally  defined  as  a  growing  function  of  the  total  number  of  its  realisations  (explicitly  obtained  from  the 
unreduced  problem  solution)  or  of  their  rate  of  change,  equal  to  zero  for  the  unrealistic  case  of  only  one  system 
realisation.1  It  is  the  latter  extreme  simplification  of  reality  that  is  exclusively  considered  in  the  unitary  theory, 
including  its  imitations  of  “complexity”,  which  explains,  as  we  continue  to  show  below,  all  its  “old”  and  “new” 
problems.  The  physically  real,  dynamically  emerging  space  and  time  defined  above  constitute  two  universal, 
elementary  manifestations  of  the  unreduced  complexity,  characterising  a  single  realisation  structure  (space)  and 
change/emergence (time). We shall proceed now to major forms and measures of dynamic complexity, representing 
all system realisations and thus its causally complete structure and dynamics. 

A  universal  measure  of  complexity  is  provided  by  the  simplest  combination  of  independent  space  and  time 
elements.  It  is  known  as  action  that  acquires  now  an  extended,  universal  and  essentially  nonlinear  meaning, 
E t
Δ = − Δ + Δ
,  where  Δ   is  the  dynamically  determined  action-complexity  increment  during  elementary 
realisation  change,  while  E  and  p  are  coefficients  identified  as  energy  and  momentum.  They  represent  universal 
differential measures of complexity related to the integral measure of action:

The  quantum  wave  equations  (of  Klein-Gordon,  Dirac  and  Schrödinger)  can  be  derived  from  eq.  (20)  by  causal 
quantisation, expressing multivalued dynamics in terms of intermediate, delocalised realisation of the wavefunction 
[4,5,12,13,16,17] (see also below). 

Elementary  field-particles,  causally  obtained  thus  as  complex-dynamical  quantum  beat  processes,  form  the 
entities of the first level of emerging real-world structure, or first level of complexity. Due to the physically unified 
world construction of two interacting proto-fields, the entities of the first level start interacting among them and form 
higher levels of complex-dynamical world structure by the same, universally described development of unreduced 
interaction process towards the probabilistic dynamical fractal of world structure. The number, physical origin, and 
properties  of  the  four  “fundamental  forces”  between  particles  obtain  a  transparent  explanation  within  this  theory 
[5,12-17]  designated  as  quantum  field  mechanics.  Long-range  interaction  through  the  e/m  and  gravitational 
protofield  gives  the  omnipresent  e/m  and  gravitational  interactions,  respectively,  whereas  short-range  (“contact”) 
interaction  between  the  protofield  elements  (poorly  resolved  as  such)  appears  as  “weak”  and  “strong”  interaction 
forces, where one can clearly see the origin of the (known) unification of e/m and weak interactions (transmitted by 
the e/m protofield) and similar (but unrecognised) unity between the gravitational and strong interaction. Moreover, 
all  the  four  interactions  are  naturally,  dynamically  unified  within  each  elementary  (hadronic)  particle-process,

especially in the maximum squeeze state of its unceasing quantum beat pulsation. Physical origin of the gravitational 
protofield,  or  medium,  can  also  be  causally  understood  now  as  a  dense,  dissipative  form  of  “quark  matter”  (or 
“condensate”), where the famous “confinement” of quarks acquires a transparent explanation. Photons, on the other 
hand,    can  be  interpreted  as  relatively  weak,  and  therefore  quasi-regular  and  massless,  excitations  of  the  “elastic” 
e/m protofield, stabilised by attraction to the gravitational medium (and being thus closer to usual, regular solitons). 

One  obtains  also  the  dynamic,  causal  interpretation  of  electric  charge  (as  quantum  beat  pulsation  with  a  fixed 
temporal  phase),  its  “quantised”  value,  and  two  “opposite”  types  (as  quantum  beat  synchronisation  in  the  e/m 
medium) [4,12-17], where the quantised e/m interaction by “exchange of photons” (during the “extended” phase of 
quantum  beat)  acquires  now  a  physically  real  sense.  The  property  of  spin  and  related  magnetic  field  effects  are 
driven by highly nonlinear vortex dynamics of the reduction-extension process within every quantum beat cycle. 

Complex-dynamic interaction development between field-particles leads to causally understood processes of true 
quantum  chaos  (absence  of  dissipation)  [4,5,9],  quantum  measurement  (small  dissipation)  [4,10],  and  classical 
(permanently  localised)  behaviour  emergence  in  an  elementary  bound,  closed  system  (like  atom)  [4,5,12-17], 
without  any  ambiguous  “decoherence  by  environment”.  Classical  behaviour  emerges  as  a  next,  superior  level  of 
complexity that gives rise, in its turn, to all higher complexity levels by further development of the same unreduced, 
intrinsically unified interaction process between two initially homogeneous protofields. The complete macroscopic 
world  structure  and  dynamics  is  thus  explicitly  obtained  from  that  starting  “minimal”  interaction  configuration, 
where such persisting “cosmological” problems as origin and emergence of space and time, the “wavefunction of the 
universe”,  classicality  emergence,  and  quantum  gravity  are  naturally  resolved,  together  with  other  problems  of 
fundamental physics, within the intrinsically unified description of complex interaction dynamics [4-7,12-17]. 

The  unrestricted  universality  of  structure  emergence  description  finds  its  most  complete  expression  in  the 
universal  symmetry  (or  conservation)  of  complexity  [4-6,13,17],  which  provides  the  unified,  causally  complete 
extension of all (correct) dynamic equations, laws and principles, remaining unexplained (postulated), separated, and 
often  contradictory  within  the  dynamically  single-valued  projection  of  reality  in  the  standard,  unitary  theory.  The 
causally specified qualitative change and explicit structure emergence in the universal science of complexity permit 
us to introduce two major forms of dynamic complexity. One of them is called dynamic information,  I, and expresses 
the real interaction complexity before any structure emergence has actually begun. It generalises the usual notion of 
“potential energy” and is actually given (in its integral version) by the generalised action, 
, introduced above. The 
second  universal  form  of  complexity  is  called  dynamic  entropy,  S,  and  characterises  the  dynamic  complexity  of 
already  appeared  structures  (it  generalises  the  usual  notions  of  “kinetic”  and  “heat”  energy).  The  symmetry,  or 
conservation, of complexity means that every process occurs so that the sum of dynamic information and entropy, or 
total  dynamic  complexity,  remains  constant, 
,  which  means  that  always  decreasing  dynamic 
=
information  (expressing  system  “potentiality”)  is  transformed  into  the  dual,  always  growing  complexity  form  of 
. The “first” and “second” laws of thermodynamics are thus essentially extended to 
dynamic entropy, 
any kind of system or process, unified in a dynamic symmetry, and liberated from unpleasant skewness of the usual 
second law (which resolves the related cosmology problems, see section 4). Contrary to any unitary symmetry, the 
symmetry of complexity is always exact (never “broken”), but gives more or less irregular structures.

Equations  (21)-(25)  constitute  the  basis  of  the  unified  Hamilton-Schrödinger  formalism  that  should  be 
accompanied by the unreduced, causally complete, and thus dynamically multivalued equation solution, such as the 
above result of the generalised EP method, eqs. (7)-(12). This universal formalism  is  a rigorous expression of the 
universal  symmetry  of  complexity  and  unifies  extended  versions  of  various  particular  dynamic  equations,  usually 
corresponding to several first terms of power-series expansion of the generalised Hamiltonian [4-6]. It provides also 
additional self-consistent substantiation of the Hamiltonian form of the starting existence equation, eq. (1). 

Cosmological  meaning  of  the  universal  symmetry  of  complexity  goes,  however,  far  beyond  its  particular 
mathematical expression. It represents the unified, exact Order of the World, applicable to the universe in the whole 
or  any  its  part,  including  its  causally  specified  origin  and  structure  development  (in  their  realistic,  unreduced 
versions).  Symmetry  of  complexity  rigorously  excludes,  in  particular,  any  possibility  of  universe  emergence  from 
“nothing” (with zero total energy), since only positive (and big) values of the initial interaction complexity (in the 
form  of  dynamic  information)  can  give  rise  to  further  structure  development  (with  equally  positive  and  big  total 
energy)  and  real  time  flow,  eq.  (22)  (see  also  section  4).  This  fundamental  positiveness  of  the  universe  content, 
distinguishing  it  from  the  zero-content  unitary  models,  is  directly  related  to  the  dynamic  multivaluedness  and 
intrinsic randomness of any real process, reduced to the dynamically single-valued projection in the unitary schemes 
that  avoid  any  real,  change-bringing  interaction.  We  shall  see  below  that  the  properties  of  the  unreduced, 
dynamically  multivalued  world  dynamics  often  do  not  even  contain,  or  permit  one  to  consistently  solve,  the 
accumulating “old” and “new” problems of the unitary cosmology and astrophysics, including the “missing” mass 
and energy content of the world. 

3.  GLOBAL PROPERTIES OF EMERGING COMPLEX-DYNAMICAL UNIVERSE 

We  shall  outline,  in  this  section,  the  “global”,  cosmological  properties  of  the  real,  complex-dynamical  world 
construction, such as they follow explicitly from the unreduced, multivalued dynamics of the underlying protofield 
interaction process (some of them were already mentioned in section 2). Note that practically none of this real-world 
properties  can  be  consistently  reproduced  by  any  version  of  the  unitary  theory,  irrespective  of  whether  it  is 
recognised  as  a  true  cosmological  problem  or  not.  Artificial  addition  of  new  abstract  entities  (such  as  “hidden 
dimensions”  or  new,  equally  “invisible”  particle  species),  accompanied  by  “facilitated”  parameter  adjustment, 
certainly cannot change this situation, since new entities create new difficulties, thus simply displacing, or renaming, 
previous  problems  that  remain  basically  unsolved  because  of  deceptive  reduction  to  over-simplified,  effectively 
zero-dimensional models. Any observed general, universal enough property can be consistently explained only with 
the help of qualitative feature of system (interaction) dynamics and not by introduction of a new, specific entity.

3.1. 

Physically Real, 3D Space Structure and Irreversible Time Flow 

We have seen in section 2 how the unreduced interaction between two initially homogeneous protofields gives 
rise  to  highly  inhomogeneous  structure  of  physically  real,  tangible  space  and  equally  real,  but  immaterial, 
irreversibly flowing time that can not be really “mixed” with space in an (abstract) “manifold”. 

We causally derive the exact number (three) of spatial dimensions, or “degrees of freedom”, as being due to the 
dynamic  entanglement  of  two  protofields  and  their  physically  real  interaction  as  such.  This  conservation  of  the 
number of basic entities, or “degrees of freedom” during the interaction process is a consequence of the universal 
symmetry (conservation) of complexity (see the end of section 2), supported by the totality of existing observations. 
We  thus  reveal  also  the  detailed  physical  nature  of  those  emerging  space  “dimensions”  (remaining  only  abstract 
symbols  in  the  canonical  theory):  they  are  obtained  as  interaction-driven,  chaotically  changing,  dynamically 
discrete, and fractal entanglement, or “mixture”, of the physically real, initially homogeneous protofields. 

We reveal the role of essential nonlinearity, omnipresent dynamic instability, and resulting causal randomness 
(chaoticity)  of  quantum  beat  dynamics  of  interacting  protofields  in  establishment  of  spatially  chaotic  sequence of 
reduction-extension events within each field-particle, which gives rise to unceasing and objectively unpredictable in 
detail (and therefore irreversible) time flow. 

Universality of the obtained concept of space and time is supported by its unrestricted applicability to any system 
or  level  of  complexity,  giving  rise  to  the  fractally  structured  hierarchy  of  space  and  time  that  simply  repeats  the 
hierarchy  of  world  (interaction)  complexity  and  demonstrates  the  dynamic  origin  and  close  connection  between 
space  and  time  elements  at  each  level  of  world  structure.  All  cosmological  problems  of  time  (its  absence  in  the 
effectively empty world, magically “tunneling” from nothing, etc.) are thus consistently solved (see the “time flow” 
condition  of  eq.  (22)  and  section  4.1  for  more  details).  Another  aspect  of  time  and  space  universality  refers  to 
similarity  of  their  fundamental  properties  throughout  the  whole  vast,  “physically  infinite”  universe.  Postulated  as 
“self-evident” in the canonical theory, this very special property finds now its substantiation in the physically unified 
structure  of  the  underlying  protofield  system  and  related  complex-dynamic  synchronisation  of  all  individual 
quantum beat processes (up to phase inversion), which determine the real time flow [4,12,13,17]. 

3.2.  Unified Complex-Dynamic Origin of Particles, Interactions, and Constants 

It is important that the two omnipresent, “pervasive” manifestations of unreduced dynamic complexity, space and 
time, emerge in the protofield interaction process in intrinsic unity with the simplest structures of the first level of 
complexity, elementary field-particles, and their fundamental properties (mass, energy, motion, electric charge, spin, 
etc.),  particle  interactions  with  their  observed  properties  (number,  range,  relative  magnitude,  unification),  and 
dynamical laws (quantum and classical  mechanics, special and general relativity), all of them being now causally 
and  explicitly  obtained  (derived)  from  the  fundamental  interaction  dynamics  (without  any  “postulates”)  and  thus 
naturally unified (section 2) [4,5,11-17]. The fundamental (measured) properties of real world structures are related 
measures  of  the  same,  universally  defined  dynamic  complexity,  while  structures  themselves  and  their  interactions 
represent  two universal,  dual  forms of  complexity,  dynamic  entropy  and  dynamic  information,  respectively,  which 
are permanently transformed into one another according to the underlying unique “order of the world”, the universal 
symmetry  of  complexity.  Omitting  detailed  discussion  of  this  intrinsically  unified  world  structure  and  dynamics 
(section 2), we note only the indispensable role of omnipresent dynamic multivaluedness and the ensuing chaoticity, 
diversity (multiplicity) of forms and adaptability of real interaction products (absent in any unitary model), starting 
from the quantum beat process that constitutes the causally complete structure of (massive) elementary particles. 

The related “difficult” problems of the unitary cosmology, which are naturally solved in our complex-dynamical 
description, include the problem of the universe wavefunction, quantisation of gravity, and quantum cosmology. The 
universe  wavefunction  is  causally  specified  now  as  the  intermediate  realisation  of  quantum  beat  processes  in  the 
physically unified protofield system. It naturally loses its quantum meaning there where classical (bound) systems 
start to emerge, but the generalised wavefunction and Schrödinger equation (see the end of section 2) re-emerge at 
each higher complexity level. As for the problem of quantum gravity, our universal gravitation is an indirect relation

(complex-dynamic) quantum origin from the beginning (as well as the whole universe) [4,5,12,13,17]. 

An  essential  novelty  of  the  complex-dynamic  cosmology  is  that  it  shows  the  physical  origin  of  universal 
constants and their universality, reduced eventually to the physically unified origin of the universe. We have seen 
above  (section  2)  that  one  of  the  constants,  the  speed  of  light  c,  is  introduced  in  our  theory  not  as  an  abstract, 
postulated  “limit  to  signal  speed”  (standard  relativity),  but  as  a  “normal”,  physical  speed  of  signal  propagation  in

3.3. 

Self-Tuning Universe Structure: Unreduced Interaction Adaptability 

It is evident already in terms of general logic that a dynamically emerging universe should have a dynamically 
consistent, self-tuning, adaptable structure, since this is the essence of genuine, autonomous structure formation as 
such. No  wonder  that  this  is  the property of  complex-dynamic  universe  structure explicitly  obtained  as  a  result of 
protofield interaction process (section 2), as it is demonstrated by the dynamic origin of main entities, properties, and 
universal constants (section 3.2). Moreover, this universal property of the unreduced complex dynamics is preserved 
at any higher level of the emerging world structure. By contrast, it is impossible to obtain a feasible, stable universe 
structure  in  any  unitary  model,  since  its  effectively  zero-dimensional  space  leaves  no  possibility  for  intrinsic 
adaptability. Mechanistic adjustment of artificially introduced entities and parameters can provide only a basically 
inefficient substitute for dynamical tuning, giving the well-known “anthropic” difficulties. 

As can be seen from the self-consistent structure of the unreduced EP formalism (eqs. (7)-(12)), a viable universe 
with  the  same  basic  properties  will  always  emerge  for generic  protofield  interaction  parameters.  According  to  the 
universal  symmetry  of  complexity  (section  2),  greater  quantities  of  dynamic  information  (generalised  “potential 
energy”) in the initial system configuration 
 will lead to bigger dynamic entropy (generalised mass-energy) of 
the emerging universe structure

Exceptions from generic rules can exist rather for extreme values of protofield interaction magnitude, but they 
also  find  their  suitable  places  in  the  holistic  complex-dynamical  world  picture.  Ultimately  strong  protofield 
interaction  will  create  a  macroscopically  large,  “many-particle”  protofield  “collapse”  that  may  have  a  number  of 
different  phases  [4],  from  a  partially coherent  “condensate”  of  elementary  particles  (“superdense”  cosmic  objects, 
such as “neuron stars”), which is still a part of “ordinary” reality, to the total protofield collapse down to their “pre-
interaction”  state  of  the  unique  “proto-matter”,  which  does  not  contain  anything  from  this  world  and  should  be 
considered as effective nothingness with respect to it. Contrary to abstract and contradictory “exact solutions” of the 
unitary  theory  (such  as  “black  holes”),  each  of  these  states  can  be  provided  with  the  causal,  physically  specified 
origin  and  structure,  showing  qualitative  correlations  with  a  number  of  observed  “exotic”  objects  of  the  universe 
(e.g. quasars) and their features. The case of ultimately weak protofield interaction corresponds to small fluctuations 
of their structure that cannot transform into real, massive matter and may account for either “primordial” state of the 
protofields or, more realistically, the observed universe state away from massive matter, in the “vacuum”, including 
propagating  ordinary  photons  and,  in  particular,  the  “microwave  radiation  background”  related  in  the  standard 
cosmology to the “remnants” of the first stages of Big Bang.2 We see now that in the causally emerging, interaction-
driven  universe  structure  such  “vacuum  fluctuations”  (cf.  also  “zero-point  field”)  are  inevitable  and  need  not  be 
related to a specific cosmological “scenario” or imposed abstract entity (see also [25]). 

Note finally the huge, exponentially large efficiency of complex-dynamic adaptability (self-tuning) process: it is 
due to unceasingly breeding and permanently changing realisations of the probabilistic dynamical fractal (section 2), 
which gives rise to real-time, “fantastically efficient” exploration by the system of (almost) all existing possibilities 
for structure development [5]. 
                                                
2 Note that unitary theory often makes reference to “vacuum fluctuations” of “zero-point field” or “space-time foam” obtained as formal solutions 
of eventually postulated equations. We emphasize the causal origin of our weak interaction limit within the same interaction process between two 
protofields at small values of effective coupling, where any strong protofield deformation, and therefore quantum beat dynamics, is impossible.

4.  UNIFIED SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF MASS, ENERGY, AND ENTROPY 

4.1.  Universe Energy Positivity and Dynamic Time Arrow 

According to the universal symmetry (conservation) of complexity (see the end of section 2), the total dynamic 
complexity does not change in a structure emergence process, but is transformed instead from its “latent” (but real 
and positively defined) form of dynamic information (expressed by the generalised action) into the “unfolded” form 
of dynamic entropy. Therefore any “compensation” of positive total energy of moving bodies by negative energy of 
their gravitational attraction, as it is implied by the unitary cosmology, is impossible in the real world dynamics. In 
fact, this “zero-energy balance” is due to zero-complexity reduction of the dynamically single-valued model of the 
standard theory. By contrast, the inevitable positivity of the total complexity-energy of any real system is due to its 
dynamically multivalued, and therefore chaotic, dynamics, where the “thermal energy” of chaotic realisation change 
always determines the large positive balance of the total energy.

0

0E >

Δ <A

tΔ >  only if 

 (because of dynamic multivaluedness) 

This energy positivity condition is directly related to the direction of the arrow of time (and the very existence of 
time flow), by a rigorously derived and absolutely universal relation of eq. (22), which means that the positive stock 
tΔ = − ΔA , 
of total energy-complexity gives rise to the flow of time as such, since for the system globally at rest 
. In other words, a universe with zero 
and with 
total  energy  could  not  exist  at  all,  in  any  configuration.  Moreover,  a  small  positive  energy  will  give  rise  to 
proportionally  small  mass-energy  content  of  the  universe  (see  also  section  3.3).  This  fundamentally  substantiated 
conclusion about the real, dynamically multivalued universe emergence and structure puts an end to various formal 
postulates and hypotheses of unitary cosmology about possibility of universe appearance from nothing by a sort of 
“quantum  tunneling”,  or  “vacuum  fluctuation”,  based  on  the  zero  energy  balance  (where  positive  mass-energy  of 
“matter” is compensated by negative energy of gravitational attraction). It involves also  the popular “Hamiltonian 
constraint”,  applied  e.g.  in  the  unitary  “quantum  cosmology”  (including  Wheeler-DeWitt  equation).  Even  when 
unitary  theory  inserts  a  positive  energy  in  its  formally  postulated  equations,  it  does  not  see  the  genuine  physical 
origin and meaning of both energy/mass and its positivity, losing the main, chaotic part of system dynamics. Indeed, 
the  zero  energy  balance  is  impossible  because  the  dynamically  multivalued,  chaotic  part  of  any  dynamics  adds  a 
dominating positive part to the total energy. We shall see that this loss of the main part of energy and motion in the 
unitary  theory  underlies  all  “difficult”  problems  of  cosmology  and  astrophysics:  mass  and  energy  are  lost  in  the 
unitary  universe  models  from  the  beginning,  and  there  is  no  wonder  that  various  aspects  of  this  basic  deficiency 
emerge inevitably with growing precision and completeness of measurements. 

E

Another aspect of positive complexity-energy and time arrow of a real universe is a permanent, strictly positive 
growth  of  dynamic  entropy  accompanying  any  structure  emergence,  which  resolves  the  old  contradiction  of  the 
unitary  science  between  the  “second  law”  (entropy/disorder  growth)  and  apparently  “growing  order”  during 
structure formation. Any unitary structure is basically regular only because of artificial limitation (dynamic single-
valuedness) of the unitary theory itself, while the unreduced analysis of structure creation process shows (section 2) 
that any, even most externally regular structure, can appear and exist only due to the dominating internal chaoticity 
of  its  different,  though  maybe  quite  similar  realisation  change  (which  is  a  limiting  regime  of  “multivalued  self-
organisation”)  [4-7].  It  is  yet  more  important  that  this  omnipresent  entropy  growth  constitutes  only  a  part  of  the 
whole symmetry, or conservation, of complexity (again contrary to the unitary science paradigm), since it occurs at 
the  expense  of  equal  decrease  of  the  initial  dynamic  information  of  the  system  interaction  configuration.  The 
universe, its real structure, evolution, and any part dynamics are based therefore on the absolutely general and exact 
(never broken) principle of symmetry, the symmetry of (unreduced) complexity, constituting thus the genuine Order 
of the World that possesses the intrinsic, autonomous, rigorously specified structure creation power. 

4.2.  Locally Missing Mass: Unitary Model Deficiency 

The  so-called  dark  mass  problem  involves  various  observation  data  showing  that  local  cosmic  structure 
dynamics  (mostly  for  galaxies)  would  need  much  larger  (from  several  to  hundreds  times  more)  quantities  of 
ordinary,  massive  matter,  than  those  that  can  actually  be  perceived (see  e.g.  refs.  [26-29]).    Big  variability  of  the 
missing  mass  effect  is  an  equally  puzzling  feature  of  the  problem.  We  show  that  these  difficulties  of  the  unitary 
theory originate from the same its incorrect neglect of the main, chaotic part of system dynamics, now occurring at 
the level of local cosmic object dynamics. If one considers the real, dynamically multivalued system behaviour, the 
problem will not appear and the truly chaotic dynamics of real objects will account for observed dynamical features

with the “visible”, normal mass values. It is important that one should take into account the genuine, dynamically 
multivalued chaos, rather than one of its unitary imitations by “involved” but basically regular behaviour. 

The  main  idea  is  physically  straightforward:  because  of  artificial  cut  of  all  system  realisations  but  one  in  the 
unitary  theory  (this  is  an  exponentially  big  reduction  for  a  many-body  system),  one  obtains  inevitably  a  “missing 
motion” problem, which is interpreted as mysteriously “missing mass” within the same unitary imitation. One can 
specify  this  result  in  various  ways,  and  we  start  with  a  demonstration  of  incompleteness  of  the  standard  “virial 
theorem”  application  to  the  real,  multivalued  dynamics  of  a  many-body  system,  since  it  shows  how  the  major 
“balance” between potential and kinetic energy can be modified by the true chaos. 

If  system  components  move  under  the  influence  of  gravitational  attraction,  e.g.  in  a  galaxy,  then  the  ordinary 
virial theorem gives the following relation between the time-averaged values of kinetic  T and potential  U energy of 
a system or any its component (see e.g. [29]):

weaker  interaction  regions  as  fundamental  modification  of  Newtonian  gravitation  attraction  itself  (see  e.g.  [30]). 
There is even a deeper link here with our unreduced EP approach: in a real many-body system one always deals with 
an effective, rather than direct, interaction that bears the self-consistent influence of all system components, differs 
essentially from the direct interaction, and possesses many contributing, chaotically changing realisations.

 and 

The  observed  big  variations  of  “dark  mass”  effects  for  different  objects  represent  a  “heavy”  difficulty  for  any 
explanation  in  terms  of  additional,  “invisible”  entities,  but  are,  on  the  contrary,  inevitable  for  the  above  unified 
explanation in terms of the true (multivalued) chaos effects that should vary a lot. Moreover,  one can trace a definite 
qualitative correlation between the expected object chaoticity (degree of irregularity), its spatial dependence, and the 
observed magnitude of “missing mass” effects (extended verification is certainly necessary). One may note also that 
it  is  much  more  consistent  to  explain  an  observed,  variable  system  property  by  a  fundamental  property  of  its 
dynamics, rather than by a new, strangely escaping, and inevitably fixed entity (it refers also to related interpretation 
of the origin of mass in the universal science of complexity and unitary field theory [4,5,12-17]). One should also 
take  into  account  the  spatial  dependence  of  chaotic  mass  distribution  effects  (or  “structural”  chaos)  that  tend  to 
accumulate  just  outside  of  the  main  mass  and  interaction  concentration  in  the  system  (especially  for  that  with  a 
“centred rotation” configuration), in agreement with data interpretation using eqs. (37). Note finally the discovered 
conceptual relation between the missing mass effects at different levels of world dynamics, including the missing 
(total) mass-energy of the universe (section 4.1), missing dynamic origin of particle mass (replaced by the artificially 
introduced  new  entity  of  “Higgs  boson”),  and  “dark  mass”  effects  at  the  level  of  cosmic  objects,  all  of  them 
explained  in  the  universal  science  of  complexity  by  the  unified,  rigorously  derived,  complete  solution  of  the 
unreduced interaction problem (cf. section 1). 

4.3.  Globally Missing Energy and Big Bang Contradictions: Deficient Linearity 

The origin of globally missing, “distributed” energy, or “dark energy” [26-28], that could also be called “missing 
universe acceleration”, is directly related to the vicious circle of the unitary cosmology scheme centred on the Big 
Bang  hypothesis,  or  “exploding  vacuum”  solution.  Indeed,  the  latter  starts  from  postulated,  artificially  imposed 
nothingness  of  the  essential  universe  content  (section  4.1),  in  the  form  of  dynamically  single-valued,  zero-
complexity  reduction  of  universe  dynamics  (irrespective  of  particular  “model”  details).  Because  of  the  intrinsic 
instability of that fundamentally fixed, static construction, one is obliged to further impose a mechanistic “general 
expansion” (or the reverse squeeze) of the universe as a single possible mode of its (totally illusive) “development”. 
The choice for expansion, or Big Bang, is justified by a particular interpretation of the observed “red shift” effect 
(the interpretation that involves a number of serious contradictions in itself). However, the conceptual instability of 
any unitary model (absence of evolving, adaptable degrees of freedom, as opposed to abstract “parameters”) persists 
in  the  form  of  multiple  particular  problems  of  the  Big  Bang  model  whose  proposed  “solutions”  only  transfer  the 
difficulties to other formulations or artificially introduced entities. The “dark energy” problem represents only the 
latest in the list, though scandalously big and long hidden, rupture in the basically frustrated construction: a slightly 
uneven red-shift dependence on distance leads to a huge deficiency in the source of uneven expansion, supposed to 
be  a  distributed  stock  of  mysterious,  invisible  energy  that  should  inevitably  take  very  exotic,  normally  impossible 
forms. This final impasse of missing energy (and mass) content of the universe simply takes us back to the beginning 
of the unitary vicious circle, where such emptiness of the universe content has been explicitly imposed by the unitary 
paradigm itself (this is but another, degenerate case of complexity conservation law, astonishing in its long-lasting 
simplification,

By  contrast,  the  unreduced,  dynamically  multivalued  and  probabilistically  fractal  structure  of  real  interaction 
dynamics  leads  to  globally  stable  concept  of  universe  structure  development,  just  because  it  is  based  on  the 
omnipresent and massively adaptable local, dynamic instability of explicit structure creation. The explicit universe 
structure emergence in the initially homogeneous system of interacting protofields, starting from the physically real 
space, time, and elementary particles, intrinsically unified with their fundamental properties and interactions, can be 
described  as  a  distributed  implosion  of  ubiquitous,  fractally  structured  creation,  as  opposed  to  mechanistic,  and 
intrinsically destructive explosion of the unitary Big Bang (and “inflation”) schemes.

Therefore  the  “dark  energy”  problem  does  not  even  appear  in  the  complex-dynamic,  intrinsically  creative 
cosmology.  The  self-tuning  universe  structure,  liberated  from  unitary  instabilities  and  related  “anthropic” 
speculations,  emerges  naturally  and  self-consistently,  simply  due  to  the  unreduced,  truly  “exact”  picture  of  the 
underlying  interaction  processes.  As  for  the  origin  of  the  observed  red  shift  effect  in  radiation  spectra  of  distant 
objects,  it  finds  its  consistent  explanation  in  terms  of nonlinear  radiation  propagation  properties  in  the  system  of 
coupled  protofields,  where  some  (relatively  weak)  loss  of  energy  by  soliton-like  photons,  propagating  in  the  e/m 
protofield medium, is inevitable because of their irreducible, though relatively weak, coupling to the gravitational 
medium.  Note  the  essential  difference  of  this  nonlinear  energy  dissipation  from  linear  scattering  effects  in  any 
ordinary,  “corpuscular”  model.  The  soliton-like  photon,  remaining  stabilised  by  interaction  with  the  gravitational 
protofield, can slowly give its energy to the gravitational degrees of freedom without any noticeable change of its 
direction of propagation (i.e. without any “blur” effects in the distant object images). Characteristic “transpiercing” 
and “circumventing” modes of soliton interaction with “weak” enough obstacles can explain anomalously small loss 
and vanishing angular deviation effects for photons and very high-energy particles (see below). One should also take 
into  account  possible  contribution  from  modified  protofield  parameters  around  big  mass  concentration  or  various 
“special” objects, as well as at earlier stages of universe structure development. Detailed calculations of the effect 
will  inevitably  involve  many  unknown  parameters  of  the  system,  but qualitative  properties  and  consistency  of  the 
whole picture provide convincing evidence in favour of this kind of fundamentally new explanation of the red shift 
effect  (within  a  broader  scope  of  “tired  light”  approach)  and  its  expected  refinement,  including  the  necessary 
clarification of the detailed physical origin of photon (missing persistently in the unitary theory framework). 

In particular, the nonlinear red shift dependence on distance that gives rise to catastrophic consequences in the 
unitary  cosmology  can  only  be  natural  in  the  complex-dynamical,  essentially  nonlinear  picture  (section  2).  The 
nonlinear  energy-loss  mechanism  of  soliton-like photons  explains why this  loss  grows  more  slowly with  distance, 
than  any  usual  mechanism  of  diffuse  scattering  would  imply  (cf.  the  above  note  on  soliton  scattering  dynamics). 
Similar  dynamics  could  solve,  by  the  way,  the  persisting  puzzle  of  GZK  effect  for  the  ultra-relativistic  particles, 
since  at  those  super-high  energies  the  motion  of  a  massive  particle  approaches  that  of  (a  group  of)  photons, 
according to the results of quantum field mechanics [4,12-17]. Another, though maybe less specific, feature of red-
shift data correlating with our explanation is the apparent growth of average scatter of data points with distance. 

5.  CONCLUSION 

Returning to the general picture of our emerging universe, note once more that it does not contain “motion-on-
circles” dynamics, on any scale of structure creation, so that the initial amount of dynamic information, in the form 
of  protofield  interaction,  gives  rise  to  generalised,  complex-dynamical  system  birth,  followed  by  its  gradual, 
irreversible,  and  “global”  transformation  into  dynamic  entropy  (developed  structure)  representing  a  universally 
defined,  finite  system  life,  which  ends  up  in  the  state  of  generalised  death,  or  equilibrium,  around  the  total 
transformation of the initial dynamic information into entropy (unless additional dynamic information is introduced 
into  the  system)  [4].  The  generalised  “potential  energy”  of  interacting  protofields  can  be  introduced  e.g.  by  their 
explicit separation from the “pre-existing” state of “totally unified” (mixed) protofields that could have the form of a 
generally  inert  quark-gluon  “condensate”  in  its  “absolute”  ground  state  (but  these  “prehistoric”  assumptions  are 
subject to inevitable uncertainty and can be estimated rather by general consistency and parsimony principles). What 
appears to be much more certain, however, is that one does need an initial form of “potential” interaction energy, 
positively  defined  and  specified  here  as  “dynamic  information”, since  the birth  of  a structured, real universe  from 
absolute “nothingness”, without genuine interaction development (which is the preferred dogma of the conventional 
unitarity), contradicts the fundamentally substantiated and universally confirmed symmetry of complexity. 

Finally, we may summarise other empirical perspectives of our complex-dynamical universe description, whose 
consistent  development  within  the  standard,  unitary  cosmology  paradigm  seems  much  less  probable.  The  highly 
uneven,  long-distance  concentration  of  various  anomalous,  super-intense  sources  of  energy  (as  well  as  their 
“peculiar” red-shift tendency) points to a (probably moving) “shape of the world”, which looks quite natural in our 
interacting  protofield  logic,  while  it  would  need  additional,  “unnatural”  assumptions  in  the  Big  Bang  logic  of 
“exploding emptiness”. Growing problems with the universe age can be naturally solved in our complex-dynamic 
cosmology as it traces explicitly the real life-cycle events of emerging structures, while the unitary theory encounters 
here another series of its inbred “instabilities” (due to the rigidly fixed “models” and mechanistic data fit). The same 
refers to structural difficulties of the omnipresent expansion and natural elimination in our approach of this and other 
“old”  difficulties  of  the  unitary  theory,  such  as  average  space  flatness  and  homogeneity  (see  also  sections  3,4). 
Intrinsic inclusion of realistic, unified solution of the stagnating problems of quantum mechanics, field theory, and

relativity  (sections  2,  3)  constitutes  the  unique  feature  of  our  theory  that,  being  highly  desirable,  cannot  be  even 
expected for any unitary approach. Irreducibly complex dynamics of detailed formation and evolution of galaxies, 
stars, and planetary systems is one of the main further applications of the present theory.

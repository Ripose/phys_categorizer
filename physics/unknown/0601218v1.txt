Abstract 

 
Quantum  mechanics  clearly  violates  the  weak  equivalence  principle  (WEP).    This  implies 
that  quantum  mechanics also  violates the  strong equivalence principle (SEP), as shown in 
this  paper.    Therefore  a  theory  of  quantum  gravity  may  not  be  possible  unless  it  is  not 
based  upon  the  equivalence  principle,  or  if  quantum  mechanics  can  eliminate  its  mass 
dependence.  Neither of these possibilities seem likely at the present time. 

1.  Introduction 

Starting with the pioneering work of Bohr and Rosenfeld (1933), all attempts to 

combine Einstein's general relativity (EGR) and quantum mechanics into a theory of 

quantum gravity (QG) over the past seven decades have been futile -- leading to 

discrepancies and even contradictions.  A theory of QG, may have far-reaching 

astrophysical implications. Quantum gravity could shed light on the big bang and the 

early universe.  QG may also determine fundamental physical attributes that start on a 

small scale and affect large scale astrophysical properties.  So it is important to explore 

this potential incompatibility.  First let us examine the weak and the strong forms of the 

equivalence principle.   It will be shown that the weak equivalence principle is clearly 

violated by quantum mechanics.  The violation of the strong equivalence principle by 

quantum mechanics is more subtle, and is difficult to show directly.  However, it will be

2.  Quantum Mechanics Clearly Violates the Weak Equivalence Principle  

The weak equivalence principle (WEP) states that there are no physical effects that 

depend on the mass of a point particle in an external gravitational field.  This is related to 

the  equivalence  of  inertial  and  gravitational  mass  which  permits  cancellation  of  the 

particle’s mass in Newtonian physics. 

 Thus the same trajectory is followed by particles 

of different mass if they have the same initial conditions.  

However this does not occur in quantum mechanics.  For a particle of inertial mass 

mi  and  gravitational  mass  mg ,  in  the  gravitational  field  of  mass  M  where  M  >>  m,  the 

Schroedinger equation is

(cid:2)h
2mi
  

(cid:4) 2(cid:3) +

Gmg M
r 2

= ih

(cid:1)(cid:3)
(cid:1)t

.   

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

Even for  mi = mg , the mass does not cancel out of the equations of motion, as can be seen 

more transparently from eq. (2) since m appears in the denominator of the kinetic energy 

term and the numerator of the potential term of the Hamiltonian.  This is more apparent 

for  mi = mg (cid:1) m , in a uniform gravitational field in the x direction, of acceleration g:

(cid:2)h
2m
    

(cid:1)2
(cid:1)x2 (cid:3) + mgx(cid:3) = ih

(cid:1)(cid:3)
(cid:1)t

.   

 

 

 

 

     

(2) 

In  examining  the  possibility  of  gravitationally  bound  atoms  in  3-space 

(Rabinowitz, 1990) and later  in n-space (2001) it was clear that m remains in 

the quantized equations of motion, even for M >> m; though m cancels out 

of the classical equations of motion in Newtonian gravity.    

 

 

-2- 

 

One would expect m to cancel  out when averaging over states with 

large  quantum  numbers  that  puts  them  effectively  in  the  classical 

continuum. 

In  quantum  mechanics, 

the  wavelength 

is 

inversely 

proportional  to  the  momentum  and  hence  involves  the  mass.    Quantum 

mechanical  interference  effects  in  general,  and  quantum-gravitational 

interference  effects  in  particular,  depend  on  the  phase  and  phase  shifts 

which depends on the momentum and hence are proportional to the mass.  

This  is  intrinsic  to  quantum  mechanics.    The  uncertainty  principle  is 

basically related to the destruction of phase relations in different parts of the 

wave function.  The weak equivalence principle requires that the equations 

of  motion  be  independent  of  m. 

 

  Even  though  SEP  works  well 

independently of QM, this is not the case in the union of general relativity 

and quantum mechanics (quantum gravity). 

3. Quantum Mechanics Violates the Strong Equivalence Principle  

 

Einstein  postulated  the  strong  equivalence  principle  (SEP)  to 

formulate  general  relativity.      The  SEP  states  that  locally  gravitation  is 

indistinguishable  from  an  equivalently  accelerating  reference  frame.    This 

implies  the  WEP  since  the  accelerating  reference  frame  is  independent  of 

the  mass  acted  upon  by  the  gravitational  field.    Furthermore,  the  SEP 

implies  that  it  is  possible  to  transform  away  gravitational  effects  in  a 

properly chosen reference frame. 

 

In  examining  the  possible  violation  of  the  SEP  by  quantum 

mechanics  (Rabinowitz,  2003),  varying  modifications  of  Einstein’s  SEP  are 

presented.      One  of  these  is  that  of  Rohrlich.    Interestingly  Rohrlich  (1965) 

doesn't  use  the  terms  WEP  and  SEP,  and  just  refers  to  the  equivalence 

 

-3- 

principle  (EP).    Rohrlich's  general  statement  of  EP  is:  The  equations  of 

motion  of  a  nonrotating  test  body  in  free  fall  in  a  gravitational  field  are 

independent of the energy content of that body.  He appears to diminish the 

role  of  SEP  in  saying  (p.42):    "True  gravitational  fields  can  never  be 

transformed away. ... Apparent gravitational fields are a characteristic of the 

motion of the observer (rather than of the observed physical system), while 

true gravitational fields  are the same for all observers no matter what their 

motion.    ...  Einstein's  statement  [of  EP]  as  an  equivalence  between 

accelerated observers and gravitational fields is now seen to be restricted to 

apparent gravitational fields.  True gravitational fields cannot be simulated 

by acceleration (i.e. by a coordinate transformation)." 

The different statements of the equivalence principle are interrelated.  

If the equations of motion involve the mass, m,  not only is WEP  violated 

but this also involves a violation of SEP. 

It is clear that SEP  (cid:1) WEP since SEP yields equations of motion of a body 

independent of its mass in a gravitational field.   In general in logic:  

If A (cid:1) B then not B (cid:1) not A.  

 

 

 

            (3) 

Since SEP (cid:1) WEP, therefore not WEP (cid:1) not SEP.   

 

(4) 

 

 

Therefore quantum mechanics violates the SEP. 

4.  Discussion 

 

To  my  knowledge,  my  approach  to  the  problem  preventing  the  

development  of  a  theory  of  quantum  gravity  is  original  and  differs  from 

that of others.  The only other paper that I was able to find which comes to 

the same conclusion as mine is that of Loinger (2003).  However, he takes a 

different  approach  than  mine  in  reaching  his  conclusion.      One  difficulty 

-4- 

 

 

 

that  has  been  previously  examined  is  the  different  role  that  time  plays  in 

Einstein’s  general  relativity  compared  with  quantum  mechanics.    Unruh 

(1993)  aptly  discusses  this  in  his  treatise  on  “Time,  Gravity,  and  Quantum 

Mechanics”.    Herdegen  and  Wawrzycki  (2003)  in  their  paper,  “Is  Einstein’s 

equivalence principle valid for a quantum particle?” conclude that the SEP and 

quantum  mechanics  are  compatible.    Davies  (2004)  discusses  tunneling 

anomalies  related  to  “Quantum  mechanics  and  the  equivalence  principle.”  

However, he does not find an incompatibility between quantum mechanics 

and the EP.   

5.  Conclusion 

Quantum mechanics clearly violates the WEP and logic shows that a violation of 

the  WEP  implies  a  violation  of  the  SEP.  Therefore  to  achieve  a  theory  of  quantum 

gravity  it  must  not  be  based  upon  the  equivalence  principle.    Or  quantum  mechanics 

must eliminate a body’s mass dependence in the equations of motion of that body in a 

gravitational field.  Neither of these seems likely at the present time

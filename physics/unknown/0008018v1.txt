Abstract. Recent advances in electron and positron sources have resulted in new capabilities driven
in  most  cases  by  the  increasing  demands  of  advanced  accelerating  systems.  Electron  sources  for
brighter  beams  and  for  high  average-current  beams  are  described.  The  status  and  remaining
challenges  for  polarized  electron  beams  are  also  discussed.  For  positron  sources,  recent  activity  in
the  development  of  polarized  positron  beams  for  future  colliders  is  reviewed.  Finally,  a  new
proposal for combining laser cooling with beam polarization is presented.

ELECTRON SOURCES

Throughout the long history of electron sources, the standard and virtually universal
configuration  of  the  dc-biased  gun  has  been  a  coaxial  design  with  a  ceramic  high-
voltage insulating tube providing the outside vacuum envelope and inside, supporting
the cathode, a metal tube at atmospheric pressure as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). This design
works  well  in  practice,  but  the  insulator  is  large,  and  the  outside  of  the  ceramic  is
subject  to  contamination  from  the  atmosphere,  which  can  lead  to  excessive  leakage
current.  With  the  advent  of  polarized  electron  sources,  various  vacuum  components
associated  with  installing  cathodes  under  vacuum  are  typically  attached  to  the  high-
voltage  flange,  leading  to  an  awkwardly  large  high-voltage  assemblage  [1].  These
problems are solved for photocathode dc-biased guns by inverting the structure to have
a smaller-diameter ceramic tube inside a larger metal vacuum chamber as shown in Fig.
1(b).  The  earliest  such  designs  were  developed  in  the  early  1990s  at  SLAC  [2]  and
independently at Novosibirsk [3]. The SLAC design was built and successfully tested at
high voltage but has not yet been used to produce electrons. Variations on the basic idea
include  the  double  insulator  design,  Fig.  1(c),  used  at  Amsterdam  [4]  and  under
development at Nagoya [5], and variations on the high-voltage connection, Fig. 1(d), as
used  at  Mainz  [6]  and  Bonn  [7].  For  a  pulsed  high-voltage  gun,  the  Fig.  1(b)  design
looks most promising.

The past decade has seen the rapid development of photocathode rf guns [8]. These
guns  are  especially  well-suited  as  high-brightness  sources.  Since  the  emittance
requirements of future colliders seems beyond the reach of any rf photoinjector design,
the need for high-brightness rf guns comes mostly from free electron laser (FEL)

developments. As an example, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) requires a 1-
nC,  100-A  beam  from  the  photoinjector  with  a  normalized  rms  transverse  emittance,
e n,rms,  of  1 m m  [9].  The  emittance  growth  in  an  rf  photoinjector is mostly correlated.
Special  techniques  have  been  developed  to  reverse  this  growth  and  then  lock-in  the
resulting emittance minimum just as the beam becomes relativistic. Experimentally the
lowest  emittance  for  an  LCLS  type  beam  is  e n,rms~2  m m  [10,11].  However,  these
measurements  were  done  with  a  spatially  uniform  but  temporally  Gaussian  charge
distribution. Simulations using PARMELA, a multi-particle tracking code, indicate that
if the temporal distribution is also uniform, e n,rms~1 m m should be achievable. Progress
in exploring the relevant parameter space has been facilitated by the recent development
of a semi-analytic code, HOMDYN [12]. Using newly discovered matching conditions
[13], simulations now predict an emittance for an LCLS type beam of close to e n,rms~0.5
m m (thermal effects included) at 150 MeV [14]. See Fig. 2.

The  possibility  of  achieving  even  higher  brightness  using  a  pulsed  diode-structure
photocathode  gun  with  GV/m  level  fields  was  first  reported  in  1996  [15].  The  high
fields are achieved by using a pulsed voltage on the order of 1 MV across a gap of 0.5 to
1  mm.  Very  short  voltage  pulses  on  the  order  of  nanoseconds  are  used  to  minimize
breakdown and field emission. Ideally the laser pulse should be shorter than the voltage
pulse. For an LCLS-type pulse, simulations predict an emittance of 0.4 m m measured
3.25 cm from the cathode [16]. Since space charge effects are still significant at 1 MeV,
a design for matching this beam into an accelerating structure is needed to evaluate the

final emittance at high energy.

Photocathode guns using III-V semiconductor cathodes are now universally used as
sources of polarized electron beams for accelerators. The successful operation of such
beams at SLAC, Mainz, JLAB and elsewhere has demonstrated operating parameters
(not all achieved at the same time) well matched to accelerator requirements. Some of
these parameters are shown in Table 1.

There remain at least 3 challenges for future polarized electron sources: overcoming
the  cathode  charge  limit;  increasing  the  polarization,  P;  and  increasing  the  average
current. 1) The maximum current density that can be extracted is limited by a surface
barrier that dynamically grows when charge is temporarily trapped at the surface faster
than  it  can  recombine  with  holes.  For  a  pulse  train,  such  as  required  by  most  future
collider designs, each pulse is influenced by the decaying surface barrier generated by
the previous pulses. New cathode structures plus differential doping may solve this

energy  experiment  which  depends  on  polarized  electrons.  In  addition,  for  a  future
collider, P>95% may be the only reasonable route to certain new physics. Most of the
polarization loss in the cathode bulk can probably be eliminated, but losses in the band
bending region may be unavoidable, limiting the maximum polarization to P~90%. 3)
Finally, the high average currents required by cw accelerators and some types of FELs
result in a rapid loss of quantum efficiency (QE) due to ion bombardment at the cathode.
Improving the vacuum near the cathode will minimize this effect.

Field emitter arrays, ferroelectrics, and secondary electron emitters have the potential
to  overcome  the  limitations  found  with  photocathodes  for  producing  high  average
currents [19]. At the present time, the latter is the most promising. It consists of an rf
cavity equipped with a secondary emission surface at one end and a secondary emission
grid  at  the  beam  exit.  Startup  electrons  multiply  rapidly  during  each  rf  cycle  while
simultaneously bunching. Steady state conditions are achieved within a few cycles for a
pulse train of fixed charge and pulse length. While the pulse spacing is fixed by the rf
frequency,  the  pulses  are  automatically  synchronous  with  the  rf.  Proof  of  principle
testing  has  been  carried  out  at  low  charge,  but  simulations  show  that  the  charge  per
bunch can be up to 500 nC [20]. There appears to be some possibility of modulating the
charge using a separate grid.

POSITRON SOURCES

Conventional  positron  sources  for  accelerators  use  a  high-energy  electron  beam
impinging on a high-Z material such as W to generate ~100 MeV g s by bremsstrahlung.
The g s in turn create electron-positron pairs in the same material. Positrons exiting the
target in the 2-20 MeV regime are confined by a magnetic field while being inserted into
an rf accelerating field, bunched and accelerated to relativistic energies for transport to
the main linac. Because the initial positron beam emittance is large, more damping is
required than for an equivalent intensity electron beam. The NLC positron source design
is essentially a scaled version of the SLC source.

It is highly desirable that the positron beam for a future collider be polarized [21]. For
many  types  of  experiments,  the  polarization  of  the  two  colliding  beams  combine  to
create  in  effect  a  single  higher  polarization.  Thus  a  highly  polarized  electron  beam
colliding  with  a  modestly  polarized  positron  beam  may  be  equivalent  to  the  desired
single  beam  polarization  P>95%.  Another  class  of  experiments  is  possible  only  with
both beams polarized. At least 3 methods of producing polarized positron beams have
been  suggested  for  colliders:  helical  undulator;  Compton  scattering;  and  polarized
electrons.

Circularly polarized g s in the required energy range and of sufficient intensity can be
produced by passing a 150 GeV electron beam through a 150-m helical undulator [22].
The  g s  are  directed  to  a  thin  conversion  target  placed  downstream  after  the  electron
primary  beam  is  bent  away.  This  is  the  design  chosen  by  TESLA  [23]  but  to  date
rejected by NLC out of concern that the post-interaction beam is too disrupted, and that
alternatively having the undulator in the main linac beamline will impose too great an

5

operational restriction on the linac. Recently an interesting proposal has been made to
operate  the  first  part  of  the  linac  at  double  the  normal  rf  repetition  rate  in  order  to
accelerate positron-production electrons along with the main beam, then at the 150-point
deflecting  the  positron-production  electrons  into  a  separate  beamline  having  the
undulator and target [24].

In the second method, circularly-polarized high-energy g s are produced by Compton
backscattering  of  circularly-polarized  photons  by  unpolarized  high-energy  electrons.
Again the g s are directed to a thin conversion target. Such a scheme was first proposed
for the JLC by Okugi et al. in 1996 [25]. Eighty-five C02 lasers, each producing 10 J per
pulse (150 Hz) at the fundamental (10.6 m m) are required, one laser for each micropulse
in  the  JLC  pulse  train.  The  cross  section  for  Compton  scattering  is  optimized  by
choosing  a  6.7  GeV  electron  beam.  A  similar  scheme  has  been  proposed  by  Frisch
(1997) that utilizes an Nd:glass laser (1.05 m m) and 1.7 GeV electrons [26]. In the latter
case, in order to reduce the laser energy requirements, a resonant cavity is introduced to
recycle the optical power, allowing the same optical pulse to interact with many electron
bunches. The mirrors for the optical cavity are problematic because of the high energy
in each laser pulse. A recent experiment at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK
demonstrated that the production of positrons from a thin conversion target for which
the g s were produced by scattering a 200 mJ Nd:YAG laser beam from the 1.26 GeV
ATF electron beam was as expected [27].

The  third  method  is  a  modification  of  the  conventional  scheme.  If  the  incident
electron beam is highly polarized, then both the high-energy end of the g  spectrum and
of the resulting positrons will be polarized [28]. The problem here is that the yield is
estimated to be 3 orders of magnitude below that required for colliders. One can imagine
a number of ways to increase the total yield, including increasing the charge per pulse in
the  production  beam,  filling  more  rf  buckets,  using  multiple  sources,  etc.,  so  that  in
principle the yield might be forced to be adequate, but the practical aspects are daunting.

SIMULTANEOUS LASER DAMPING/POLARIZING

Potylitsin  has  recently  proposed  [29]  that  direct  polarization  of  an  unpolarized
positron beam by Compton scattering [30] may be a more efficient source of polarized
positrons than the methods discussed above.1 For this case, the energy and polarization
of the polarized positrons after N collisions with identical circularly polarized photons

For  example,  a  2  GeV  positron  bunch  in  a  single  interaction  with  a  25  J  laser  pulse
(l o=1 m m) would be expected to result in a polarization of ~60% if le can be reduced to
0.2 mm [31]. For a collider such as the NLC with 95 microbunches per pulse train and
120 Hz repetition rate, an average laser power of 0.3 MW is required! However, since
the positron beam must in any case be damped, let us review the requirements for laser
damping.

A  powerful  laser  can  be  used  to  damp  an  electron  or  positron  beam  by  Compton
scattering  [32].  The  requirement  for  a  significant  reduction  in  the  initial  transverse
normalized emittance, e no,  is  that  the  electrons  should  lose  a  similar  fraction  of  their
initial energy, Eo, as a result of the Compton interaction:

in  a  single  pass  to  reduce  the  transverse  emittance by a factor of 10 (again assuming
le=0.2 mm), which is about the same laser requirement as for polarization.

Laser  cooling  can  be  combined  with  a  storage  ring  [33]  or  a  damping  ring.  The
current design of the 1.98-GeV NLC damping ring [34] has a circumference of 297 m,
so  the  rotation  frequency,  n rot,  is  ~1.01  MHz.  Three  NLC  pulse  trains  of  95
microbunches  each  are  damped  for  3  interpulse  periods  or  ~25  ms.  Therefore  each
microbunch passes a reference point in the ring ~2.5· 104 times. The proposal here is to
combine laser cooling with polarization in the NLC damping ring, substituting the laser
interaction for the wiggler. By combining these functions, there might be a considerable
cost  savings.  In  addition,  installation  of  the  polarization  function  can  in  principle  be
delayed until sometime after the damping function is commissioned.

Combined  with  a  damping  ring,  a  modest  Nd:glass  laser  system  plus  an  optical
resonator as suggested by Frisch for the case of Compton scattering from an unpolarized
electron  beam  to  produce  g s  can  be  envisioned  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.  For  maximum
polarization, the total laser energy seen by each microbunch should be ~25 J or Eb=1 mJ
per rotation. This is a reasonable energy per optical pulse for the resonator. The average
laser energy (at 1 m m) required for each microbunch in the ring is Pb,avg = E b·  n rot~1
kW. The NLC ring rf is 712 MHz with spacing between microbunches of 2.8 ns (i.e.,
filling every other rf bucket). There is also a gap between each pulse train. With all 285
microbunches  in  the  ring,  the  laser  must  operate  at n L=357  MHz,  and  thus  the  total
n L =357 kW. The average power required of the injection
average power is Ptot,avg= Eb·
laser  is  Pinj,avg=100  W  (l =1 m m)  operating  at  357  MHz,  which  is  probably  doable.
Likewise the resonator gain of G=Ptot,avg/Pinj,avg=3.6· 103 can probably be achieved. The
principal uncertainty is that the stability of an optical resonator operating under these
conditions is unknown. Also the ring design will have to accommodate 2 spin rotators,
and the bunch length will have to be reduced, at least in the laser interaction region, to

the order of 0.2 mm. Given these complications, a new ring design, optimized for both
laser damping and polarization, should be considered.

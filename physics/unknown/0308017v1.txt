Abstract 
As  an  expansion  of  complex  numbers,  the  quaternions  show  close  relations  to  numerous 
physically fundamental concepts (e.g. Pauli Matrices).  In spite of that, the didactic potential  
provided by quaternion interrelationships in formulating physical laws are hardly regarded in 
the current physics curriculum. In particular, many approaches emerge that are useful in con-
veying the unity of seemingly distinct theories in a didactically convincing manner.   
This  will  be  exemplified  with  the  help  of  special  relativity.  The  diverse  examples  of  spatial 
and space-time rotations are merged into a didactic whole by introducing quaternion transfor-
mations and comparing them to the representation using rotation matrices common in physics 
books.

1. Quaternions, a brief introduction 
As  an  expansion  of  complex  numbers  quaternions 
present  a  foundation  for  a  mathematically  simple 
representation of rotations.  Thus it is not surprising 
that  especially  in  the  field  of  software  development 
the rotation of virtual structures in general is accom-
plished  using  the  mathematics  of  quaternions  rather 
than rotation matrices because of their formally easy 
implementation. This does not only save time in cal-
culating,  but  is  easily  comprehensible  and  over  all 
can  be  implemented  without  difficulty  once  the 
formalism is understood.  
 
Thus it is worthwhile to further examine the didactic 
potential  of  mathematically  representing  physical 
processes using quaternions. 
 
2. What are quaternions? 
A quaternion q, technically speaking, is a four tuple 
with  a  one-dimensional,  scalar  part  qo  and  a  three-
.
  k  [2].    The 
dimensional  vector  part  q1 

  j  +  q3 

  i  +  q2

.

 

basis  vectors  i,  j  and  k  are  subject  to  the  rules  of 
multiplication

established  by William R. Hamilton on October 16, 
1843  [1]  and  are  responsible  for  significant  proper-
ties  of  quaternions  due  to  their  anti-communicative 
structure.  The  representation  of  a  rotation  with  the 
help  of  quaternions  is  generated  as  a  result  of  the 
identification  of  the  position  vector  x  with  the  qua-
ternion four tuple (0, x), whereas the rotation around 
the angle Θ is performed by a unity quaternion 
 q = (cos Θ/2 + u 
.
.
 (0, x) 

 
 
.
according to   (0, x’) = q 
 
The  newly  created  position  vector  x’  can  be  read 
easily  from  (0,  x’),  whereas  the  rotation  axis  corre-
sponds to the unity quaternion (0, u) with u = u1 
 i + 
  k  [2].  Specifically  remarkable  is  the  rela-
u2 
tionship  between  the  rotation  angle  Θ  and  the  qua-
ternion angle Θ/2, which is also physically reflected 
in the spin with a  rotational symmetry of 4π instead 
of the actually expected value of 2π. This astounding 
doubling  of  the  angle  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact 
that  two  subsequent  reflections  at  two  planes,  that 
are  inclined  toward  each  other  at  an  angle  of  Θ/2, 
equal a rotation around the angle Θ.

3. Didactic  approaches  for  representing  quater-

nions 

 

Numerous  attempts  exist  in  trying  to visually repre-
sent  the  rotational  symmetry  of  720°  or  4  π.  Thus 
Richard  Feynman  at  times  successfully  demon-
strated  in  his  lectures  (see  for  example  sequence  of 
pictures  in  [4])  that  the  original  state  of  a  rotating 
marked cup is recovered only when rotated twice. If 
the  object  is  rotated  once  at  360°  the  arm  of  the 
presenter  remains  in  a  topologically  contorted  state 
and to a certain extent is inextricable in this demon-
strational experiment, which goes back to Dirac. 
 
This inextricableness has to be considered explicitly 
for  the  representation  of  a quaternion multiplication 
and is the product of a changed algebraic sign of the 
quaternion state variable. Conway and Guy [3] real-
ized  this  with  their  quaternion  machine  in  that  they 
employed  an  additional  degree  of  freedom  in  the 
form of an indicator of an algebraic sign (twisted tie, 
see picture 1). 
 

 

 

    i0 = +1        i1 = + i        i2 = –1       i3 = – i       i4 = 1 

 
(yellow: front, blue: rear of the ribbon. 
 The other two quaternion units j and k can be found 
 on the blue rear of the plate.) 

 
  Picture 1:  Quaternion machine according to [3]. 
                     Shown is the fourfold multiplication by i. 
 
In  accordance  with  an  idea  in  [5]  the  difference 
between  the  original  position  of  an  object  and  the 
object  rotated  by  360°  can  be  demonstrated  by  a 
simple  construction.  In  picture  2  this  was  accom-
plished  with the help  of a square plate  that was fas- 
 

2 

 

tened  to  the  corners  of  a  box  with  rubber  bands.  If 
one turns the plate once, then the bands twist to the 
point where they are not able to be disentangled. Yet 
if the plate is turned twice and the rubber bands are 
consequently  more  twisted,  they  can  however  be 
disentangled with some patience. 
 
4. Quaternions in university-level physics 
If  students  are  confronted  with  unfamiliar  quantum 
mechanical phenomena such as the spin for the first 
time  in  their  studies,  this  confrontation  is  usually 
accompanied  by  a  failure  of  mathematical  methods 
that  had  been  effectively  applied  previously.  They 
are  taught  that  new  physics  require  new  mathemati-
cal instruments such as for example the Pauli matri-
ces 

 

 
 
 
 

2 = σy 

σx 
2 = σz 
2 = 1 
σx σy = – σy σx = i σz 
σy σz = – σz σy = i σx 
σz σx = – σx σz = i σy 

 
This  didactic  approach  to  conveying  new  physical 
concepts  in  a  practically  revolutionary  manner  and 
by way of simultaneous concept changes in multiple 
fields,  certainly  corresponds  with  the  significance 
that is ascribed to the modern quantum mechanics in 
the history of the development of modern physics. 
 
This  paper  however  will  focus  on  the  question  of 
whether it would me more beneficial for an effective 
learning  process  to  defuse  this  change  of  concepts 
represented simultaneously in a physical and mathe-
matical  manner  by  providing  the  students  with  new 
mathematical  resources  in  advance.  In  the  physical 
sense  the  concept  of  the  quaternion  (thus  also  the 
Pauli matrices) is actually nothing new and its main 
purpose  allegedly serves to provide a more conven-
ient  description  of  an  already  known  physical  proc-
ess, i.e. rotation. 
 
It  is  therefore  useful  to  discuss  the  mathematics  of 
quaternions  in  connection  with  special  relativity. 
The benefits are numerous: 
-  The  mathematical  formalism  is  more  readily  un-
derstood  if  it  is  linked  to  known  physical  phe-
nomenon. 

 

-  The  students  are  able  to  take  a  meta-conceptual 
standpoint when discussing the theory of relativity 
since  they  are  familiar  with  a  variety  of  mathe-
matical approaches. 

-  A clear demonstration of special relativity is pos-
sible only by way of rotation matrices under con-
sideration  of  one  spatial  coordinate,  as  this  is the 
case  in  nearly  all  introductory  physics  school-
books.  It  is  easier  to  formulate the Lorentz trans-
formations  without  these  restrictions,  by  using 
quaternions. 

-  Numerous  other  problems  can  be  elegantly  ex-

plained with the help of quaternions.

5. Special relativity 
In special relativity spacetime consists of three space 
dimensions  x,  y,  and  z  as  well  as  one  of  a  time  di-
mension  ct.  As  the  speed  of  light  is  constant,  the 
four-dimensional  distance  between  two  events  is 
equal  in  all  inertial  systems.  A  transformation  be-
tween  two  inertial  systems  is  thus  considered  an 
active rotation of a four vector

around  the  origin of the coordinate system in so far 
as translations are disregarded as physically uninter-
esting parallel shifts [6].

Naturally a real rotation angle α needs to be selected 
so that the dimension qualities do not change. 
 
If  one  then  shifts  to  a  two-dimensional  space-time 
rotation, the following rotation matrix is useful in its 
representation:

This is a Lorentz transformation as long as the angle 
of  rotation  is  imaginary  and  is  identified  with  the 
speed of transformation 
 
 
 
according to [7]. 
 
Two aspects become apparent: 
 

.
v = i c 

 tan ϕ 

 

 

1)  The  structure  of  the  matrix  has  changed. 
Solely  space  and  space-time  rotations  are 
effectively  differentiated  based  on  the  ma-
trix positions that they take on. 

2)  The  domains  of  definition  of  the  angles 
need to be selected accordingly. A complex 
or  a  purely  imaginary  angle  α  leads  to  an 
unphysical  situation  as  would  a  mixed-
complex or purely real ϕ. 

 
On  the  one  hand,  the  illustration  with  the  help  of 
matrices has didactic benefits: 
 

3 

       →  In  order  to  correctly  interpret  the  theo-
retical  representation,  students  have  to 
use physical arguments. 

 
On  the  other  hand,  this  can  present  didactic as well 
as aesthetic problems: 
 

       →   A  theory  that  allows  non-physical  so-
lutions can hardly be considered as com-
plete. 

 
From  the  viewpoint  of  special  relativity  it  thus 
makes  didactic  sense  to  provide  the  students  with 
theoretical  resources  with  which  the  interpretation 
problems  described  above  may  be  considered  from 
another  point  of  view.    This  approach  will  be  dis-
cussed  in  the  following  with  the  representation  of 
special  relativistic  transformations  using  quater-
nions. 
 
- Representation using quaternions 
The  Lorentz  transformation  was  already  formulated 
by both Einstein [8] and Dirac [9] using quaternions.  
However,  their  general  representation  is  so  abstract 
that an introduction at this level seems hopeless. The 
fundamental associations however can be reduced to 
a  point  didactically  so  that  they  can  be  instituted  at 
the introductory level.   
 
The  four  vector  is  from  now  on  defined  with  the 
help of the quaternion units

As a result this choice of the angle corresponds to a

fied with 
 
 
Consequently, physical-structural as well as didactic  
benefits develop:

1)  The  structure  of  the  mathematical  object  Q 

remains unchanged. 

2)  The extension of the domain of definition of 
the  rotation  angle  no  longer  leads  to  un-
physical situations.   

 

 
This  leads  to  the  fact  that  a  discussion  concerning 
the theory behind the theories and thus to a concep-
tionally all-encompassing analysis of special relativ-
ity by the students becomes possible. 
 
- Continued unification 
The  next  question  posed  is  what  happens  when  a 
mixed-complex  rotation  angle  is  selected.  The  qua-
ternion  approach  can  induce  an  encompassing  un-
derstanding of physics and build a bridge back to the 
representation  of  matrices  by  posing  this  important 
question.

Moreover,  the  new  coordinates  can  be  discerned 
from the brackets: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
First of all it is shown that the formalism introduced 
here  classifies  the  real  part  of  the  angle  automati-
cally as a space rotation, whereas the imaginary part 
causes  a  space-time  rotation.  The  necessary  addi-
tional  conditions  for  the  matrix  representation  are 
not needed. 
 
Secondly, the relevant matrix representation

can  be  easily  deduced  from  these equations without 
problems.  It  becomes  immediately  obvious  that  this 
rotation matrix is the product of both of the original 
matrices as expected. 
 
6.  Prospects 
The  approach  presented  here  provides  numerous 
possibilities  for  development.  Thus  one  of  the  most 
impressive  properties  of  the  relativity  theory  is  not 
only  that  Maxwell’s  equations  are  contained  within 
it  in  their  entirety,  but  also  that  the  formulation  of 
these  equations  can  be presented more clearly. This 
is due to the fact that the equations possess a higher 
symmetry  within  the  framework  of  special  relativi-
ty. 
 
Having  important  consequences  for  the  learning 
process, the analysis of quaternion representations of 
other  relativistic  relationships  should  be  a  further 
theme of physics education research. 
 
If  one  would  like  to  moreover  work  through  the 
general  relativity  theory  didactically,  then  it  is 
hardly possible to avoid that the interaction between 
group  theoretic  aspects,  the  Pauli  matrices  and  the 
theory  of  relativistic  phenomenon  is  researched  in 
more detail. 
 
A further objective emerges in the conceptual differ-
entiation presented here in the text between the qua-
(cid:71)
 and the imaginary unit i. Even though 
ternion unit  i
the Lorentz transformation was presented within the 
context of a quaternion representation, it is however 
not  clear  what  didactic  consequences  a  strictly  oc-
tonion formulation can provide.

However,  all  of  these  possible  dilations  remain  in-
adequate  didactically  if  epistemological  conditions, 
philosophical  views,  or,  as  is  illustrated  in  [10], the 
current  Zeitgeist  of  the  surroundings  within  which 
the students and teachers are acting are not simulta-
neously  considered.  This  will  be  briefly  illustrated 
by  three  of  the  four  discussed  meta-principles  of 
chapter 13 [10] (Philosophy in Physics) that have an 
influence on physical thinking, research and study. 
 
- The unity of nature 
The  meta-principle  of  the  unity  of  the  natural  laws 
postulates, „that all nature is amenable to the same 
kind of theoretical treatment“ [10].  Even though the 
description of special relativistic effects by means of 
rotation  matrices  as  well  as  the  description  using 
quaternions  both  adhere  to  this  meta-principle,  it  is 
possible  to  work  through  the  differing  stages  of 
implementation  of  the  meta-principle  with  the  stu-
dents,  while  discussing  both  approaches.  Due  to  its 
structural  density,  the  quaternion  representation  is 
without a doubt a more unified theory in comparison 
to the matrix representation. 
 
- The principle of plenitude 
This  principle,  which  is  intensely  discussed  among 
scientists, states that „anything which is not prohib-
ited is compulsory“ [10]. The task of physics educa-
tion  research  should  be  to  enable  the  students  not 
only to receptively follow the discussion, but also to 
actively  find  a  convincing  standpoint. The compari-
son  of  rotation  matrices  and  quaternions  allows 
didactic  access  to  such  a  cognitive  process  by  ana-
lyzing  the  properties  of  angles.  Specifically  the 
question  of  whether  rotation  matrices  with  complex 
angles are feasible potentially introduces some diffi-
culty in following this principle. 
 
The outcome of the discussion may be open and may 
lead  to  an  inverse  meta-principle  as  was  indirectly 
formulated in section 5: If the potential outcomes do 
not appear in nature as they were described theoreti-
cally,  then  the  theoretical  description  might  have 
gaps  or  is  at  least  inappropriate.  Regardless  of 
whether  different  physicists  or  students  of  physics 
will  invariably  have  different  opinions  concerning 
this question, the impact this meta-principle has had 
on the development of physics should be pointed out 
frequently.  Dirac  postulated  the  existence  of  posi-
trons  and  magnetic  monopoles  based  solely  on  this 
principle. 
 
- The principle of mathematical beauty 
The  (mathematical)  beauty  of  a  physical  theory  is 
actually  not  a  comprehensible  property,  however  it 
repeatedly  makes  its  appearance  in  fundamental 
discussions  comparing  different  theories.  Bearing 
special relativity in mind, arguments for and against 
the  beauty  of  the  approaches  introduced  here  will 
resurface.  Such appraisals of the theoretic-structural 
beauty  of  a  physical-mathematical  representation 

 

5 

orient  themselves  less  on  abstract  concepts  and 
rather  on  practical  categories  like  convenience  in 
application, i.e. convenient theories or complexity of 
structure,  i.e.  complicated  theories [10]. Ultimately,  
the  intention  behind  the  request  for  (mathematical) 
beauty  is  to  work  out  a  possibly  transparent  and 
concise 
theoretical  configuration  of  a  physical 
thought construct, i.e. a very didactical intention. 
 
Similarly  the  other  meta-principles  can  be  under-
stood  as  didactic  central  themes  that  are  able  to  be 
implemented with the support of special relativity. 
 
- Special thanks 
I  would  like  to  thank  Ralf  Bürger  (http://www.uni-
potsdam.de/u/physik/didaktik/homepage/bue/rbuerg

education  research  group  at  the  University  of  Pots-
dam for the help in developing the materials for the 
experiments.

This result gives the following transformation equations: 
   ct’  =  ct . cos ϕ + ix . sin ϕ  
   iy’  =  iy . cos α + iz . sin α 

 
 
 
 
 
This text was fist published in German as: 
 

ix’  =  ix . cos ϕ – ct . sin ϕ 
iz’  =  iz . cos α – iy . sin α

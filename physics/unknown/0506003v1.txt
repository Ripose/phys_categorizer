The devastating megathrust earthquake of December 26 2004 off the west coast of

northern  Sumatra  has  been  probably  the  largest  since  the  1960  Chile  event.  Its

moment  magnitude  has  been  estimated  to  be  9.0  (corresponding  to  a  seismic

moment release of 4(cid:1)1022  N  m)  using  surface  wave  data  but  some  researchers

suggest that about 2/3 of the elastic energy has been emitted aseismically exciting

only extremely low frequency normal modes (1). This event was energetic enough

to  have  detectable  effects  on  Earth  rotational  parameters.  Very  preliminary

calculations,  taking  into  account  only  the  high  frequency  energy  emission  and

consequently  underestimating  global  effects  show  that  the  Sumatra  earthquake

should have produced a pole shift large enough to be identified in the observed

data series, a small change in the length of the day and a change in the oblateness

of the Earth (2).

Though there have been, in the last years, several numerical results indicating that

the  permanent  deformation  field  associated  with  giant  earthquakes  could  be

detectable on extremely large scale (comparable with plate dimension), until now,

extremely far field post-earthquake deformations have never been detected except

for a single controversial observation associated with the Alaska 1964 event (3, 4).

Now, the Sumatra event represents a unique candidate to test this hypothesis.

With this aim, the world-wide network of permanent IGS sites have been examined

using  the  weekly  averaged  time  series  available  at  the  SOPAC  data  centre

(ftp:\\garner.ucsd.edu).  After  constraining  the  weekly  GPS  solutions  to  the

ITRF2000 frame, the time series have been subject to a hypothesis test (t-test) to

detect  the  presence  of  coseismic  offsets  (Fig.  S1,  Tab.  S1).  Significant

displacements  are  detected  for  GPS  sites  covering  a  vast  region  around  the

epicenter  location  in  an  area  exceeding  107  km2:  All  the  previous  instrumental

evidence  of  long  distance  seismic  residual  permanent  deformations  covered  an

area below 105 km2 (5).

We  have  modeled  the  residual  permanent  deformation  associated  with  the

earthquake using a spherical model of global co- and postseismic deformation (4).

The results agree with the observed deformation quite well in several sites while

the fit is poor especially in Indian sites (Fig. 1). In general, the sites where the fit is

not good display a greater amount of observed displacement with respect to the

computed  one.  This  could  confirm  the  hypothesis  of  a  considerable  amount  of

deformation  energy  released  aseismically  (1).  Here  we  present  a  preliminary

attempt to include some aseismic moment release on three additional planes with

respect to the one originating the seismic rupture (6) the first one represents the

extension of the fault plane along the slab, the remaining two correspond to the

aftershock area (1). The inclusion of aseismic effects led to an improvement in the

quality of the fit for most of the sites even if for few stations it remains fairly poor

and await for more sophisticated source inversion modeling. Although very much

numerical modeling effort in the future is needed to precisely describe the residual

permanent  deformation  field  caused  by  this  giant  event  and  to  assess  the  role

played by aseismic energy release and long term postseismic displacements, the

observations and numerical modeling already available allow us to affirm that the

Sumatra earthquake excited a permanent detectable deformation field on such a

great spatial scale that its effects can be considered as almost global.

GPS time series of the East (red) and North (blue) components for selected sites in

a large area surrounding the epicenter. The coseismic offset has been computed

averaging  the  positions  of  two  weeks  after  the  event  with  respect  to  a  running

mean  filtered  series  (monthly  window).  The  permanent  GPS  site  at  Singapore

(NTUS)  exhibits  the  largest  horizontal  displacement  (16.8  ±  2.2)  mm  in  the

westward  direction  (W20°N);  a  clear  displacement  of  the  Indian  plate  is  also

evident in three different sites shifting 10 - 14 mm towards the East.

Table S1: Horizontal site displacement estimated from the GPS time series.

The  weighted  mean  of  the  residuals  of  the  two  weeks  after  the  mainshock with

respect to the running box average (one month window) represent the cumulative

displacement after the event with respect to restful plates. The errors are 1-sigma

values (68% confidence region). The last column of the table shows the quantity

(1-(cid:1)), where (cid:1) are the significance values derived from a t-test on the presence of

the  coseismic  displacement.  A  value  of  (1-(cid:1))  close  to  100%  means  that  the  co-

seismic  step  is  highly  significant.  It  has  to  be  noticed  that  the  significance  level

should be interpreted with caution since it tests only simple step-wise behaviour in

the time series and eventual postseismic effects may also play an important role.

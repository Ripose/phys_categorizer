Abstract:

The 26 dimensions of Closed Unoriented Bosonic String Theory 
are interpreted as the 26 dimensions of 
the traceless Jordan algebra J3(O)o of 3x3 Octonionic matrices, 
with each of the 3 Octonionic dimenisons of J3(O)o 
having the following physical interpretation: 
4-dimensional physical spacetime plus 4-dimensional internal symmetry space; 
8 first-generation fermion particles; 
8 first-generation fermion anti-particles. 
This interpretation is consistent with interpreting the strings 
as World Lines of the Worlds of Many-Worlds Quantum Theory
and the 26 dimensions as the degrees of freedom of 
the Worlds of the Many-Worlds.

The following sections of this paper are about:

The 26-dimensional traceless subalgebra J3(O)o is thefoundation for a representation of

the 26-dim Theory of Unoriented Closed Bosonic Strings as the

MacroSpace of Many-Worlds

since each World of the 

MacroSpace ofMany-Worlds

 can be seen as a 1-Timelike-dimensional String ofSpacelike States, like a World Line or World String, and

since the

Here are some descriptions of a few relevant terms:

 

 

Michio Kaku, in his book Introduction to Strings and M-Theory(second edition, Springer 1999), says:

closed [super] string ( Type II )

... the fields can either be chiral or not. Closed strings are, bydefinition, periodic in sigma, which yields the following normal

"... the 
mode expansion:

S1a(s,t) = Sum( n = -infinity; n = + infinity ) San exp( -2 i n( t - s ) ) ,
S2a(s,t) = Sum( n = -infinity; n = + infinity ) S'an exp( -2 i n( t + s ) ) .

If these two fields have different chiralities, then they arecalled 
supergravity

. ...

Type IIA

. ... this

represents the N = 2, D =10-dimensional reduction of ordinary N = 1, D = 11

... there exists a new 11-dimensional theory, called
, containing 11-dimensional supergravity as itslow-energy limit, which reduces to Type IIA [super] string
theory (with Kaluza-Klein modes) when compactified on a circle.... the strong coupling limit of 10-dimensional Type IIAsuperstring theory is equivalent to the weak 
coupling limit of anew 11-dimensional theory [ M-theory ], whose low-energylimit is given by 11-dimensional supergravity. ... Usingperturbation theory around weak 
coupling in 10-dimensional TypeIIA superstring theory, we would never see 11-dimensional physics,which belongs to the strong coupling region of the theory. ...M-
theory is much richer in its structure than string theory. InM-theory, there is a three-form field Amnp, which can couple to anextended object. We recall that in 
electrodynamics, a pointparticle acts as the source of a vector field Au. In[open] string theory, the [open] string acts asthe source for a tensor field Buv. Likewise, in 
M-theory, amembrane is the source for Amnp. ...

M-theory

... Ironically, 11-dimensional supergravity was previouslyrejected as a physical theory because:

(a) it was probably nonrenormalizable (i.e., there exists acounterterm at the seventh loop level);
(b) it does not possess chiral fields when compactified onmanifolds; and
(c) it could not reproduce the Standard Model, because itcould only yield SO(8) when compactified down to fourdimensions.

Now we can veiw 11-dimensional supergravity in an entirely newlight, as the low-energy sector of a new 11-dimensional theory,called M-theory, which suffers from 
none of these problems. Thequestion of renormalizability is answered because the fullM-theory apparently has higher terms in the curvature tensor whichrender the 
theory finite. The question of chirality is solvedbecause ... M-theory gives us chirality when we compactify on aspace which is not a manifold (such as [ 
as S1 / Z2
where we find E8 xE8 symmetry emerging when we compactify on [ 

 ] line segments). And the problem thatSO(8) is too small to accommodate the Standard Model is solvedwhen we analyze the theory nonperturbatively,

Note that  theD4-D5-E6-E7-E8 VoDou Physics Model solves the problems of11-dimensional supergravity in differentways, but uses many similarmathematical structures 
and techniques. 

Michio Kaku, in his book Strings, Conformal Fields and M-Theory(second edition, Springer 2000), says:

S: M-theory on S1 <---> IIA

 ... TypeIIA [super] string theory is S dual to a new, D = 11theory called M-theory, whose lowest-order term is given by D = 11

S: M-theory on S1 / Z2 <---> E8 x E8

Note that S1 / Z2 can have two different interpretations. 

John Baez

 says: 

"... Z_2 acts in various ways on the circle. 
Let's think of the circle as the subset
{(x,y): x^2 + y^2 = 1}  of R^2. 
Z_2 can act on it like this:
(x,y) |-> (-x,-y) 
and then S^1/Z_2 = 
which is a manifold, in fact a circle.
... 
Z_2 also can act on the circle like this:
(x,y) |-> (-x,y) 
and then S^1/Z_2 is an orbifold, 
in fact a closed interval. ...".

The physical interpretations of RP1 in 
the 
as Time of SpaceTime and
as representation space for Neutrino-type 
(only one helicity state) Fermions 
might be viewed as having some 
of the characteristics of a orbifold line interval.

T-duality

 ... a duality in string theory, usually ina toroidally compactified theory, that leaves the couplingconstant invariant up to a radius-dependent rescaling and

Introduction
The general objective of time time series analysis is to obtain useful information from a
signal regarding the state of the source of the signal. 

Recorded biomedical signals are typically sequences (time series) of readings (measure-
ments) xn at times tn, n = 1, 2 , ..., N (the number N of data points is commonly in the
range of 102 to 106). The analysis of such signals is concerned with two main intercon-
nected problems. First we have the task of denoising the signal; i.e., to separate (or
extract) the relevant biomedical component from the noise, or from the contamination by
other (cid:147)disturbing(cid:148) biomedical components (e.g. the eye blink from the brain signals in
EEG) or the signal conditioning system. Once we have a denoised signal we may have to
deal with the second task: interpreting the signal, which is, to answer the question: what
is the meaning of the signal? One important point to emphasize here (see also Ruelle,
1994) is that the effects of the "massage" and filtering by the signal conditioning system
may severly complicate the analysis of the data because it is modified by the dynamics of
the filter.

In analysing signals we have two basic approaches: the dynamic approach and the
statistical approach. The dynamic approaches are outgrowths of the attempts to relate the
signals to the bio-physico-mathematical models of the signal source. Statistical methods
are typically (cid:147)ignorant(cid:148) about the (cid:147)mechanism(cid:148) of the source and frame their task as that
of finding an optimised algorithm (such as the ones based on ARMA-processes, see
H(cid:228)nsler, 1997; Moschytz & Hofbauer, 2000) for predicting new data from old data (e.g.
for control purposes), or to compute parameters for classification. This algorithm may
have no obvious relation to what may be the dynamic details of the source. Thus, the
system is regarded more or less as a (cid:147)black box(cid:148). An interesting class of methods is
based on neural networks (Haykin 1999) which have especially been used for
classification purposes and pattern recognition, and again, not (primarily) for providing a
realistic model of the system at hand. 

With the advent of nonlinear times series analysis (Abarbanel 1995; Diks 1999; Kantz &
Schreiber 2000; Schreiber 1998) there has been a convergence between the statistical
approaches and the dynamic approaches (Tong 1990, 1995). Chaotic dynamics has
shifted the emphasis from trying to determine the exact path of a dynamic system to
calculating averages for the paths of the system. Also it has been realised, that the
dynamic methods of analysis may be useful even if it cannot be directly ascertained that
the system satisfies the criteria for a low dimensional deterministic system. It has been
claimed (Rapp et al. 1999; Jones 2001) that a new paradigm has emerged within dynamic
system theory - that of algorithmic modelling. In algorithmic modelling the starting point
is the time series per se, not a physico-mathematical model of the system ("newtonian
paradigm"). Thus, one uses the time series as the primary data and tries to construct an
algorithmic model for this data, relevant for the purposes at hand, using methods that
have been developed in the theory of dynamic systems. There are at least two theoretical
justifications for this approach. First, the nonlinear dynamic theory (originating with the
qualitative theory of J H PoincarØ (1854 - 1912) has shown that relevant information
(useful e.g. for classification purposes, not necessarily for predicting) can be obtained
about a dynamic system from a time series generated by this system even if we have
limited previous knowledge of the specifics of the system. Secondly, even a very
complicated system (such as the heart) may operate in regimes where most of the degrees
of freedom are (cid:147)frozen(cid:148) and where the system therefore behaves as a low dimensional
deterministic system. This point has been forcefully demonstrated by Haken (Haken
1983, 2000) and his (cid:147)school(cid:148) in synergetics. Naturally, traditional modelling is still im-

3/72

portant (Rieke et al. 1999; Keener & Sneyd 1998; Higgs & Herzog (Eds.) 1995; Koch
1999; Quarteroni 2001, 2000; Weiss 1996; Daune 1999). With regard to time series
analysis such models can inform us what sort of transitions, patterns, etc., to look for in
the signal, and how to effectively extract these features from the time series. 

The study of nonlinear dynamic systems has also suggested the existence of so called
dynamic diseases (Mackey & Glass 1977; Milton 2000); that is, cases where the normal
functioning of a physiological system is disrupted, not primarily because of an organic
failure, but because the dynamics has been shifted into a critical regime (the reason for
this shift could be an improperly working control dynamics). This is compared with how
changes of parameters in nonlinear dynamic system may radically alter the behaviour of
the system (bifurcation,
transition to chaos, etc.). Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and
epileptic seizure have been proposed to be instances of dynamic diseases. (In total there
are at the present some 30 - 40 types of diseases that have been tentatively identified as
belonging to the class of dynamic diseases). A general observation is that healthy organ-
ism tend to have chaotic dynamics, whereas disease is related to a more regular state. As
e.g. Leon Glass and Joseph Zbilut have pointed out in the context of heart studies that a
chaotic dyanmics may be better prepared to swiftly respond to changing conditions.

Thus, chaos, or random fluctuations, may not necessarily be detrimental to the normal
functioning of an organism. Indeed, the concept of stochastic resonance (Gammaitoni
1998; Bulsara & Gammaitoni 1996), originally introduced in physics by R Benzi and
coworkers in 1981, has also been found to be of relevance for understanding physio-
logical systems (Moss, 2000). Stochastic resonance works as an amplification
mechanism which uses the random fluctuations of the environment in order to change the
state of the system. A simple example is a particle in a potential well which, without the
input of some small amount of random energy, would never be able to get out of it. A
biological example would be a subthreshold neural signal which may, with the aid of a
random fluctuation, exceed the threshold and thus trigger an action potential (cid:150) a basic
mechanism of amplification which is thought to play an important role in enhancing the
sensitivity of biological signal processing systems. The somewhat conterintuitive result
is that adding noise to a signal detecting system may enhance its sensitivity - a fact that
probably has biological implications.

There is another similar aspect in which chaotic dynamics may enhance the vigilance of
living organisms. Thus, instead of an inert stable equilibrium state, a chaotic system may
have a strange attractor (Ruelle, 1989) such that the system visits continuously all parts
of the attractor (this is connected with a so called ergodic property). Indeed, this is
believed to be an important feature of the brain dynamics. In a sense this property of
constantly tracing out its (cid:147)territory(cid:148) helps the system to avoid getting trapped into a dead
end as suggested above. The (cid:147)ergodic(cid:148) property of chaotic system has an interesting
consequence from the control theoretical perspective. If one wants to stabilise a certain
orbit (or a fixed point) of the system, one has only to wait long enough till the system
visits a neighbourhood of the desired orbit and then activate a control mechanism (e.g. by
adjusting some of the parameters controlling the dynamics) which will keep the system
close to this orbit. This scheme is realised by the so called OGY-control method (Ott,
Grebogi & Yorke 1990). (The progress towards the desirable control point/orbit can be
accelerated by the method of tracing.)

The central idea of algorithmic modelling is the construction of a phase space, from time
series alone, using the delay embedding method (Packard at al. 1980) originally proposed
by David Ruelle. A scalar time series xn , which we suppose is generated by a (bounded)
deterministic dynamics, is mapped on vectors

zk = (xk, xk+d, ... , xk+(m-1)d)

4/72

where d is the delay, and m  the embedding dimension. The vectors z trace out a set in the
m-dimensional space Rm.
If m is large enough this map will generically unfold the a
(cid:147)diffeomorphic(cid:148) copy of the original phase space (or rather the subspace where the
system dwells). That means that diffeomorphic and topological invariants computed for
the reconstructed phase space will be the same as the ones we would have computed in
the original phase space had it been available to us. Thus, we may get access to character-
istics of the original dynamics without any previous knowledge of the system.

A lot of research has been carried out since the 1980(cid:146)s, when the embedding reconstruc-
tion of phase space was first proposed, with regard to the practical applicability of the
method as a basis for time series analysis. Generally, good results have been restricted to
careful prepared low dimensional systems (effective dimensions in the range of 2 (cid:150) 3). In
these cases there are reliable and robust methods for calculating dimensions (of the
attractors), Lyapunov exponents, entropies and so on, as well as robust and effective algo-
rithms for denoising and (short time) prediction (for algorithms and implementations see
Hegger, Kantz & Schreiber 1998, and Kantz & Schreiber 1997). In the physiological
realm claims of promising results have been reported about applications of the nonlinear
time series analysis to the study of brain signals (EEG), especially in predicting the onset
of epileptic seizure (Sakellares et al. 1986). In another application Schreiber and Kaplan
(Schreiber & Kaplan 1996) has successfully employed nonlinear methods for separating
mother and foetus ECG-signals. Measures based on nonlinear dynamics ((cid:147)point correla-
tion dimension(cid:148) P2Di) are also reported to be able to discriminate, using heart beat data,
patients with high risk for ventricular fibrillation (VF) among cardiac patients. The P2Di
advocated by Skinner (see Skinner et al. 1998) is claimed to work for nonstationary
signals. Still, nonstationarity is a stumbling block for most time series method used
today. Another crucial problem for nonlinear time series analysis are the apparent high
dimensional cases (Hegger, Kantz & Olbrich 1998) - how to distinguish a deterministic
high dimensional signal from noise, and how to get reliable measures in high dimensional
cases without necessarily an exponential increase in the demand on the size of data?

For classification purposes (diagnosis) the absolute meaning of the parameters are
seldom of importance, only the relative orders count. Thus it might be of greater interest
to track the change of, say, the (cid:147)dimension(cid:147) of a signal rather than its absolute value
(which may be difficult to interpret). The fact that sometimes the order of the data, or
whether it is above or below a threshold, is more important than the absolute values of
the data leads to a great simplification in the form of symbolic dynamics (Bai-Lin, 1989).
As an example, one may mark the instant when a time series crosses a threshold by 1, and
the other instances by 0, thus replacing the original time series with one consisting only
of zeroes and ones. Such a procedure is e.g. justified when one is interested only in the
frequency of the changes for instance (typical applications are breathing patterns, heart
rate variability, and the study of the synchronisation of signals such as heart rate and
breathing). Generally symbolic dynamics is based on coarse graining; that is, dividing
the phase space into a finite number of cells #1, ..., #n and then recording only in which
cell the dynamic system presides at a given moment. This method naturally effects
considerable compactification of the data and also alleviates the sensitivity to noise.

Determinism means that points close to each other in phase space at a time t will
probably be close to each other at a time t + ∆t. This property is used in the Recurrence
Quantification Analysis (RQA) of time series (Eckmann et al., 1987). Basically one
calculates the difference |zn (cid:150) zm| (using the delay embedding) which constitutes the
recurrence matrix Rn,m. Deterministic signals will show regular patterns in the recurrence
matrix. Besides offering new visual tools (recurrence plots) a number of new parameters
can be defined based on RQA (cid:150) one of the most important ones is the %DET-parameter

5/72

((cid:147)percent determinism(cid:148)). %DET is about zero for a random signal and close to 100 for a
deterministic signal. RQA has been applied to sEMG, heart rate variability, breathing
patterns, EEG, etc. One study (Filigoi & Felici, 1999) reports e.g. that (cid:147)RQA may be
proposed as a valid tool for the study of sEMG (...) on of the parameters extracted with
the RQA technique, namely %DET, was shown to be a good and reliable measurement of
the intrinsic structure of the signal itself(cid:148). Ikegawa S et al. (2000) report a favourable
comaprison between RQA-analysis and FFT-methods in assessing muscle fatigue from
lumbar EMG.

In an earlier study (Nieminen & Takala 1996) applied nonlinear time series analysis to
measured (by needle) myoelecric signals (MES) and compared the result with classical
ARMA models. The study obtained results that "support the use of the theory of
nonlinear dynamics in the modelling of the myoelectric signal". Using nonlinear
prediction test (Kennel & Isabelle 1992) the MES was found to possess "a structure
statistically distinguishable from high-dimensional
linearly correlated noise". The
embedding dimension estimated on the basis of the nonlinear predictability was in the
range of 5 to 7.
It is also claimed that the dimension (including the "correlation
dimension") showed a significant decrease when the muscle fatigued (isometric test). The
authors advocate the theory of nonlinear dynamics for "the analysis and modelling of the
MES". Of course, already establishing a new significant parameter based on these
methods would be an important step, irrespective of whether an explicit model can be
devised or not. 

Chaotic phenomena, irregular shapes etc., have often been studied by methods from
fractal analysis. A recent fractal method is the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) in-
troduced by Peng et al. (1994). It has now become one of the basic methods for analysing
heart beat sequences (Peng et al. 2000; M(cid:228)kikallio 1998) and long range correlations in
general. The DFA-method divides the integrated time series in blocks of size n for
increasing n. For every block one calculates the squared difference between the
integrated time series and its best
linear fit within the block (this involves the
"detrending"). The root square of the sums of these squared differences for block size n
defines the "fluctuation" F[n] which is often found to vary as a power of the block size n,
. The exponent α of this power relation defines a pertinent parameter called
the self-similarity parameter (when applicable it is related to the so-called Hurst expo-
nent H by α = H + 1). This method can be applied to non stationary series as it is insensi-
tive to slow trends in the data. In one study of brain signals (EEG) (Hwa & Ferree 2001)
they identified two scaling regions in terms of α and speculated that this signifies distinct
dynamic processes at work.

A principal motivation behind algorithmic modelling is the fact that we may expect to
encounter more and more problems where traditional modelling in terms of explicit
functional relations are not available, or too complicated to implement as such. Algo-
rithms therefore become an even more important tool, not just for handling the numerics
of traditional newtonian models, but also for the very formulation of the models. The de-
velopment of modern computers and electronic data acquisition systems has also made
the use of the algorithmic approach feasible as well as imperative. Yet in the final end the
newtonian models are also necessary if we want to understand what is going on. Algo-
rithmic models may work as a bridge between newtonian models and experimental data.
In the future we may expect a closer relation between newtonian models, algorithmic
models, statistical methods, and time-frequency methods in time series analysis. For
instance, we might expect an improved understanding of the molecular dynamics on the
cellular level, which in turn may lead to better models for the cell interactions and the
in order to be able to design optimal
signals generated in these processes. Also,

6/72

electrodes we need to know how the signals are generated and transmitted through the
biological tissue and how they finally interact with the electrode.

supporter was the National Technology Agency of Finland, Tekes.)

1. Basic theoretical concepts

1.1 Dynamic systems

1.1.1 Continuous systems

F : M ×R×R  M

Generally a continuous dynamic system consists of a manifold M (phase space) and a
map (evolution, flow)

such that if the system is in the state x0 ∈ M at t = t0 it will have moved to the point x = F
(x0, t, t0) at time t ∈ R. This is commonly written also as  

(1)

x=F t , t 0

 x0

(2)

F t 2 , t 0

=F t 2 , t1

° F t1 , t 0

x t =F t  x0

(3)

F st=F s ° F t

The Eq (1) epitomises the concept of determinism: If the state x of the system is given at
a time t = t0  it is determined at any other time t  by the map (1). Determinism implies that
evolving from time t0  to t1, and then from t1  to t2, is the same as evolving from t0 to t2:

Eq (2) is called the "Chapman-Kolmogorov law". If the evolution in Eq (1) only depends
on the time difference t1 - t0  we have a so called autonomous system and instead of (1) we
may write

which gives the state of the system at any time t + t0 when it was in the state x0 at (an
arbitrary) time t0. Eq (2) has for an autonomous system the simple form

A simple 2-dimensional example is the rotation in the plane M = R2  is given by

F t  x= cost 

sin t 

which rotates the vector

x =   x1

by t radians clockwise. Typically we do not have an explicit expression for the map F but
at best a differential equation for the evolution of the system:

(4)

dx
dt

= f  x , t 

For autonomous systems the time dependence in the RHS of Eq (4) is dropped. Since the
time of Isaac Newton (1642 - 1727) such equations (4) have been the focus of theoretical
research in physics (for a modern introduction to Classical Dynamics see e.g. JosØ &
Saletan 1998). Only a small ("integrable") subset of the problems in science leading to
equations of motion (4) can be solved explicitly. Usually one has to further simplify the
equations (by introducing approximations) or/and solve the equations numerically. This
is especially true of nonlinear problems where the function f
in (4) is a nonlinear
function in x. A classical one-dimensional simple example of a nonlinear problem which
cannot be explicitly solved was given by J Liouville (1809 - 1882) (this is an example of
a Riccati differential equation - see e.g. Simmons (1972), especially problem nr. 8 on p.
248):

The historically important 3-dimensional example of a dynamic system which was stud-
ied by E Lorenz in 1963 (Lorenz 1963) (as a simplified model of atmospheric dynamics)
is given by

=­b⋅z x⋅y

Because of the nonlinear second order terms on the RHS of Eq (1.1.1-6) the equations
can generally only be solved numerically.

1.1.2 Discrete systems

Discrete dynamic systems arise naturally from continuous systems when we try to solve
the Eq (1.1.1-4) numerically. This usually implies a discretization of time: tn = n ∆t,
where ∆t is the time step used in numerically integrating Eq (1.1.1-4). The simplest
numerical method of integrating Eq (1.1.1-4) is the Euler method:

(1)

xn1= xn f  xn , t n⋅ t
t n1=t n t

9/72

The smaller the time step ∆t the better, in general, will xn approximate the true value of x
(n∆t). Whereas the Euler method is sufficient for integrating numerical data (when f is
given by empirical data), there are a great number of refinements of the procedure, one of
the most frequently used being the Runge-Kutta method of 4th order (Abramowitz &
Steugun 1965; Harris & Stocker 1998), which can be applied when f
is a given analytic
function. 

The general definition of a discrete dynamic system comprises a set M and a map (N is
the set of natural integers)

(2)

F : M ×N  M

Given a point x0 ∈ M we obtain a sequence xn (an orbit) by

(3)

x n1=F  x n , n

Thus "time" is given as a discrete set of points 0, 1, 2, ... and F describes the evolution
for one time step. A much studied discrete nonlinear one-dimensional system is the
logistic map

(4)

x n1=⋅x n⋅1 ­ x n

For the special parameter value λ = 4 the map (1.1.2-4) is termed the Ulam map (after S
Ulam (1909 - 1984)) which exhibits fully developed chaos. The figure below shows the
time series of the Ulam map with the initial value x0 = 0.3. The time series looks random,
yet it is a deterministic series produced by the simple map (1.1.2-4). From Eq (1.1.2-4)
we also oberve that the evolution is irreversible; from xn+1 we cannot uniquely determine
the previous value xn.

1.1.3 Chaos and attractors

Consider the simple linear one-dimensional system (λ < 0)

(1)

dx
dt

=⋅x

x t =F t  x0=x0⋅e⋅t

which has the solution
. Apparently, the set of points {Ft(x)}
will approach the equilibrium point x = 0 as t → ∞ for negative λ. This is an example of
an attractor which in this case consists of a single point (x = 0). In a more general
situation the attractor {Ft(x): t → ∞} may be a submanifold S of the phase space M.
Then, for a wide range of initial points x0 the orbit Ft(x0) will approach S ⊂ M as t
→ ∞. The figure below shows the attractor of the Lorenz system for the standard
parameter values (σ = 10, r = 28, b = 8/3).

10/72

From the figure it appears as if the attractor would be a complicated 2-dimensional sub-
manifold. Indeed, attractors may be complicated sets, called fractals, as they are associ-
ated with "fractal dimensions". When studying dynamic systems the attractors may be of
intrinsic interest as their structure may give important information about the behaviour
of the system. By numerically investigating Eq (1.1.1-6) Lorenz discovered that the
evolution of the system had a very sensitive dependence on the initial conditions. Indeed,
two orbits, x(t) and y(t), initially close at a time t = 0 tend to diverge at an exponential
rate with time (λ > 0):

(2)

∣x t ­ y t ∣≈∣x 0­ y 0∣⋅e⋅t

This is a defining property of chaotic dynamics. Of course, for a bounded system the dif-
ference (2) cannot grow beyond the size of the system. Thus (2) may be approximately
valid only for restricted time spans. Anyway, the upshot is that long range predictions
become virtually impossible. This fact had already been noted theoretically by the mathe-
matician J Hadamard (1865 - 1963) in 1898 in connection with an investigation concern-
ing the geodesics (curves of shortest lengths connecting two points) on manifolds of
negative curvature which also lead to diverging paths. For a chaotic dynamics the state x
will asymptotically reach an attractor S, but for long time spans it will be impossible to
predict where on the attractor the point will be. Such chaotic attractors are called strange
attractors.

The Eq (2) is connected with the concept of stability. Suppose y(0) is an equlibrium
point, and thus y(t) = y(0) remains fixed, then if λ> 0 Eq (2) means that a small devia-
tion from the equilibrium leads to a growing excursion away from the equilibrium point;
thus we have an unstable equilibrium. This is a characteristic property of chaotic sys-
tems.

1.1.4 Lyapunov exponents

In the limit for small t > 0 Eq (1.1.3-2) essentially gives the definition of a Lyapunov
exponent λ (after A M Lyapunov (1857 - 1918)). Consider two orbits of the system
(1.1.1-4) starting at neighbouring points x0 and x0 + ∆x0. The difference (we consider the
autonomous case here)

 x1=F t  x0 x0­F t  x0

11/72

between the two orbits satisfies the equation (for small ∆x0)

(1)

 x1≈ DF t  x0⋅ x0

where DFt(x) is a matrix (the derivative of Ft vis-a-vis x) which determines the "rate of
expansion" eλt (cmp. Eq (1.1.3-2)). By computing the average expansion along the orbit
Ft(x0) we obtain the Lyapunov exponents λ. If we have a positive Lyapunov exponent for
a bounded system, λ> 0,
this indicates that the system is chaotic. Thus, the calculation
of Lyapunov exponents is an important method for investigating the properties of a
dynamic system. The Lyapunov exponents can be computed by directly measuring the
separation of nearby orbits as a function of time and using Eq (1.1.3-2) as a definition of
the Lyapunov exponents λ. For a continuous system of dimension n we can define n
Lyapunov exponents. Indeed, imagine a small sphere V of radius r at the point x ∈ M.
Then the flow Ft of the dynamics will map, for small t, V on an ellipsoid V* whose main
axes, arranged in a descending order, are r1 ≥ r2 ≥ ... ≥ rn. Then the Lyapunov exponents
at x can be defined by (in the limit of  t → ∞)

(2)

r∣
⋅log∣r i

i= 1 
t

Systems with attractors are typically dissipative systems; that is, any volume in the phase
space will contract during evolution. Given a volume V in the phase space, the flow Ft
will map it (for t > 0) on a contracted volume. This is equivalent with the sum of the
Lyapunov exponents being negative. For bounded continuous systems the Lyapunov
exponent in the direction of the flow is zero if the trajectory contains no fixed point
(deviations along the orbit are mapped on the orbit itself - no separation between two
different orbits occurs). Thus, for a chaotic and a dissipative system we must have a
dimension n ≥ 3 since, besides the zero Lyapunov exponent, at least one Lyapunov
exponent must be positive (to cause the separation of orbits), and at least one must be
negative in order for their total sum to be negative.

From Eq (1.1.1-4) it can be shown that the rate of change of volumes V due to the flow is
given by (the "divergence" of  f)

which will be the same as the total sum of the Lyapunov exponents. For the Lorenz
system (1.1.1-6) we therefore obtain

which indeed is negative for the standard choice of parameters (σ= 10, r = 28, b = 8/3).
Lyapunov exponents are of special interest as they are independent of the co-ordinate
system ("diffeomorphic invariant"). This follows because they are obtained by an
averaging procdure. The invariance has important implications for the analysis of time
series. Indeed, it means that the special representation chosen for the data does not affect
the value of the global exponent. Of particular interest is the maximal Lyapunov exponent
λ1. A positive maximal Lyapunov exponents signals the presence of chaos. The maximal
Lyapunov exponent is obtained as the exponent λin Eq (1.1.3-2) in the limit of x(0) → y
(0) and t → ∞:

The reason why Eq (1.1.4-3) extracts the maximum Lyapunov exponent is because in this
limit the factor e1⋅t overshadows all the other factors determining the separation of the
is also quite straightforward to implement
orbits. The formula in Eq (1.1.4-3)
numerically.

For discrete systems we can have chaos already in the one-dimensional case as the logis-
tic map testifies. Consider the case of the Ulam map (λ= 4 in Eq (1.1.2-4) ). It has the
fixed point (or equilibrium) x* = 3/4. Let wn = xn - x* be the deviation from the fixed
point, then we have 

(4)

w n1=­2 ⋅w n­4 ⋅w n

2

Thus, x* is an unstable fixed point of the Ulam map, the deviation growing as the power
of 2 with each time step near the fixed point.

1.1.5 Poincaré sections

There is an interesting way (introduced by PoincarØ) of obtaining a discrete (n - 1)-
dimensional dynamics form an n-dimensional continuous dynamics. The case n = 3 may
illustrate the general situation. Thus, suppose we have an orbit x(t) = Ft(x) in R3. A
suitably placed (oriented) plane P will intersect the orbit in a discrete set D of points x(tk)
called a Poincaré section. We may select those points at which the tangent of the orbit
and the normal of the plane point to the same side of the plane (i.e. we may choose the
points where the orbit intersect the plane from the "behind"). Since we have deterministic
system the point x(tk) ∈ P will uniquely determine the point x(tk+1) ∈ P; that is, we have
2-dimensional discrete dynamics (setting xk = x(tk))

(1)

x k 1=G  x k 

in the plane P. The PoincarØ section contains the fundamental information about the orbit
x(t), such as the Lyapunov exponents (the "redundant" zero-Lyapunov exponent is elimi-
nated in the PoincarØ section).

1.1.6 Fractal dimensions

The attractors may have a complicated structure. An important parameter describing
geometrical structures is the fractal dimension which generalizes the usual integer valued
topological dimension. Mandelbrot (1982) has been the chief progenitor of the field of
the fractals. The classical example (L F Richardson, 1963) is the problem of determining
the true length of the rugged coast line such as that of of England. The shorter the length
l of the measuring stick the longer will the measure of the coast line turn out to be.
Indeed, using maps of different scales it was empirically found that the total length L
varies as a power of the length scale l:

13/72

(1)

Ll ∝l 1 ­D

The parameter D is called the fractal dimension of the curve. (For the coast of France it
was found that D ≈ 1.204; for Norway, D ≈ 1.52; for Portugal, D ≈ 1.115.) Apparently,
for a smooth line D = 1, agreeing with the usual topological dimension, because when the
length scale l becomes small enough L(l) will no longer depend on l.

Another way to write Eq (1.1.6-1) is as

(2)

Ll ∝ N l ⋅l

(3)

N l ∝l­D

(4)

D=liml 0

where N(l) is the minimum number of boxes with side l needed to cover the curve.
Comparing (1.1.6-2) and (1.1.6-1) we infer that 

This argument can be generalized to other sets than curves. Thus, if for some set S ⊂ Rm,
the minimum number of boxes with sides l needed to cover the set scales as (1.1.6-3) in
the limit of small l, then the box-counting dimension, or the Kolmogorov capacity, D is
defined as the limit

to calculate in practice from measurement data.
This dimension may be difficult
However, one can define (Hentschel & Procaccia 1983) a sequence of dimensions D0, D1,
D2, ... , among which D0 is the same as the box-counting dimension D above. Suppose
again that N(l) is the minimum number of disjoint boxes #1, #2, ...., #n (n = N(l)) with
side l needed to cover S. Let the number of points of S contained in the box #i be Ni so
that probability for a randomly chosen point in  S  to be in  #i  is given by

Apparently the definition (1.1.6-5) agrees with (1.1.6-4) in the case q = 0. It is possible to
take the limit q → 1 in (1.1.6-5) which results in the information dimension

The name information dimension comes from its close relation to the Shannon entropy in
the theory of information (Shannon & Weaver 1949). The so called correlation dimen-
sion D2 is singled out because there are efficient algorithms for its computation (Grass-
berger & Procaccia 1983). One can show that Dq+1/Dq as a function of the probabilities pi
has a the maximum value 1 whence it follows that

(7)

D0≥ D1≥D2≥⋯

Thus, D2 provides a lower bound for D1 and D0. The name "correlation dimension" for D2
comes form the terms pi × pi in the sum (1.1.6-5) when q = 2 which can be interpreted as
the probability for two randomly drawn points from the set S to belong to the same box
#i. If points {Fnτ(x): n → ∞} are uniformly distributed over the attractor S we have 

D0= D1=D2=⋯

i.e. all the dimensions agree; in the opposite case we have a so called multifractal. A
difference between the dimensions (1.1.6-5) measures the lumpiness of the distribution of
the points in the attractor. Indeed, there is another way to define the sequence of
dimensions (1.1.6-5). Let Nx(r) be the number of points of the set {Fnτ(x0): n → ∞} which
are inside a circle of radius r around the point x ∈ S. Now one can show that the avearge
of Nx(r) over S, denoted by  <Nx(r)>,  scales like  r D0 as r → 0, and that in general

Power laws are ubiquitous in nature (Mandelbrot 1982; Schroeder 1991) and it is there-
fore also of great interest to investigate the presence of such "laws" in biological systems
and time series.

1.1.7 Entropies

The concept of entropy stems from thermodynamics (C E G Clausius) and statistical
physics (L Boltzmann) and was introduced into the theory of information by C E
Shannon (1916 - 2001). In the context of dynamical systems information has to do with
the amount of data needed to identify a point (i.e., the length of its "address label", or the
number of bits needed to fix the point) in the phase space given a certain minimum size
of resolution. If we have a set of points xn ∈ S, n = 1, 1, 2, ..., N, and cover S with
disjoint boxes #i (with sides l) - defining a partition P of S - each box #i which contains
Ni points of the set {xn}, then the average information in bits needed to identify a point in
this set {xn} as belonging to a certain box #i is given by Shannon entropy (where pi =
Ni/N  as before)

A RØnyi (1921 - 1970) defined a sequence of entropies Hq, q = 0, 1, 2, ....  by

If we take the limit q → 1 we obtain the Shannon entropy (1.1.7-1). Entropies provide
also invariant numbers describing the dynamics (and was for this purpose introduced into
dynamics by A Kolmogorov), perhaps not as much used as the Lyapnuov exponents.
Again, it is quite difficult to get reliable estimates of the entropies from experimental data
due to the requirement on the size of data; the case q = 2 is the most tractable one from
the computational point of view. H2 gives a lower bound for H0 and H1 since we have H0
≥ H1 ≥ H2 ... . More precisely, for q > 1 it can be shown that Hq+1/Hq as a function of the
probabilities pi satisfies (similar relation for the dimensions Dq)

Indeed, the lower bound corresponds to the case pi → 1, e.g. for i = 1, and otherwise 0.
The upper bound corresponds to the uniform distribution  p1 = ... = pn = 1/n.

If we use a finer and finer partition the sums in (1.1.7-1) and (1.1.7-2) will diverge.
However, there is a way of getting a finite limit by subtracting entropies. For this, let
denote the joint probability, that for an arbitrary n, xn is in the box #i1, xn+1 in

pi1 ,... ,i m

the box #i2, etc, and define then, generalizing Eq (1.1.7-2)

The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies  hq are then obtained as upper limits of the difference

(the supremum limit is over all possible partitions P). The difference Hq(m + 1) - Hq(m)
gives the increase in information needed to locate a point of the set {xn} in an (m+1)-
dimensional space instead of an m-dimensional space. The existence of the limit (1.1.7-
4) means that this increment will "saturate" for high values of m. In dynamics the
sequence {xn} will correspond to a time series  Fnt(x0). The entropy will then be a measure
of the rate of the separation of the orbits. Consider a small box B and its transformation

16/72

Ft(B) by the flow as t → ∞. The set Ft(B) may become very complicated as time t grows
which means that we need more information (number of bits) in order to locate a point of
the sequence {xn} in Ft(B) than in B. This increase in the requirement of information for
locating a point is reflected in the entropy. Entropy also gives a measure how far in the
future it is possible to make predictions for the dynamical system.

1.2 Geometry from time series

1.2.1 Embedding

The arena of dynamics is the phase space. However, measurement data is usually a se-
quence of real numbers (a time series) x1, x2, ...., and we may have no information about
the details of the dynamics. Assuming that the time series is determined by an unknown
deterministic dynamics it is still possible, under quite general conditions, to reconstruct
its phase space and thus make it possible to apply the theoretical methods for dynamical
systems that were described in the previous sections. This is the foundation of nonlinear
time series analysis. The reconstruction is based on a very simple idea. Typically the
differential equation for a dynamical system is equivalent to an mth order differential
equation

Under quite general conditions there exists a solution x(t) which is uniquely determined
by the initial values (at  t = t0)

P d m x

 d m­1 x t 0

dt m­1

d m­2 x t 0
dt m­2

,

,... , x t 0

This means that a phase space for the system may be described in terms of the variables

For a discretizised system the differential are replaced by differences which means that
for the phase space reconstruction we can use as variables (which was suggested by
David Ruelle - see Packard et al. (1980) the time shifts of  xk:

y1= x
y 2=dx
dt
⋯
y m=d m­1 x
dt m­1

(1)

y1= x k
y 2= x k 1
⋯
y m= x k m­1

17/72

The form (1.2.1-1) is a special case of a slightly more general form where we use a delay
d that can be different from 1. Thus, given a (scalar) time series x1, ... , xN, then its m-
dimensional embedding in Rm with delay d is given by the vectors

(2)

z1= x1 , x1 d , ... , x1 m­1⋅d
z 2= x2 , x 2 d ,... , x 2 m­1⋅d
⋯

As an example, take the Ulam-time series which is graphed in section 1.1.2. If we map
the time series into R2 using m = 2 and  d = 1 we obtain the figure below. 

Thus the apparent random series reveals the simple structure of the dynamics when em-
bedded in R2. With real data it may not be obvious how to choose the parameters m and d
for an optimal embedding. By chosing m large enough the dynamics will indeed unfold,
but an excessive large dimension m will be a disadvantage when one wants to extract
information from the data about dynamics since typically the requirement on the size of
data grows as a power of the dimension m. One method for finding an optimal embedding
dimension is to compute the number of false neighbours for m = 1, 2, ... The idea is the
following one: Two points which are close in the m-embedding may be so because the
time series is a projection of the unfolded trajectory in a higher dimension. Two points
not close in the higher dimensional space may get projected close to each other in the
lower dimensional space. True neighbours though will remain neighbours when we
embed the time series in a higher dimensional space, whereas the false neighbours will
get "divorced". Thus,
the "optimal" embedding dimension can be chosen as the
dimension m beyond which a further increase in the dimension does not resolve any
further false neighbours. For a yet another method of determining the embedding
dimension see the section 1.2.3 on nonlinear prediction.

The effect of  d  can be illustrated by the simple sinus-wave data

(3)

100 
x n=sin2 ⋅ n

If we embed this series using d = 1 and m = 2 we obtain the graph

18/72

i.e., it is almost a diagonal. However, if we use d = 25, which is a quarter of the period T
(= 100) of the wave (1.2.1-3), then we get 

which much more clearly shows the trajectory (circle) in the phase space than in the pre-
vious case. The point is that if we chose d too small, xk+d will contain almost no new
information compared with xk. If d is too large, on the other hand, xk+d and xk will be only
related like two random numbers (if we have a chaotic dynamics). One idea for determin-
ing the delay d is to calculate the autocorrelation for the time series,

and to take d as the value of k where the autocorrelation has reached about 1/e:th of its
maximum value at k = 0. Another proposal is to use the mutual information I(k), which is
a generalization of the autocorrelation, and to take d as the first point of minimum of the
mutual information (see e.g. Abarbanel 1996). In order to define mutual information for a
scalar time series xn, divide its range into subintervals #i. Then by the histogram method
calculate the probability pi for a point to be in the interval #i, and the joint probability pi,j
(d) that if xk is in #i (for any k) then xk+d is in #j. Finally the mutual information is defined
by the expression

Eq (1.2.1-5) describes the amount of information (in bits), averaged over the orbit,
"shared" by the signal xk and its time shift xk+d; that is, how much we can learn from one
signal about the other. Thus, if they are independent we have pi,j(d) = pi pj and the mutual
information is zero. 

1.2.2 The Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm 

Very useful algorithms in nonlinear time series analysis have originated with (Grass-
berger & Procaccia 1983). The basic algorithm consisted in computing the fraction of
pairs of points in the embedded space that lie within a distance ε of each other. This
defines the "correlation" C(ε):

where the Heaviside function Θ  is given by

 x={0

From the definition of C(ε) we may expect, if an attractor is present in the system, that
its dependence on ε reflects the fractal dimension of the the attractor. Indeed, in this
case C(ε) will scale as

(2)

C ∝D2

where D2 is the correlation dimension discussed earlier. An important improvement to the
basic algorithm can be introduced by avoiding pairs of points which are too close in time,
because such points tend to lie on a one-dimensional
line and thus lead to an
underestimation of the dimension in (1.2.2-2). This correction is effected replacing Eq
(1.2.2-1) by

where all pairs closer than nmin ("Theiler correction") in time are neglected. (nmin is
typicallly chosen to be around 500, or 10% of the total number of points.)

 

Corresponding to the series of entropies and dimensions discussed in 1.1.6 and 1.1.7
there is a generalization of (1.2.2-3) which will capture these parameters (for q > 1)

C q , m∝q­1⋅Dq⋅e­q­1⋅H qm

As has been pointed out, the case q = 2 is generelly feasible. The dimensions and en-
tropies are being estimated from (1.2.2-5) by finding scaling regions where

(6)

becomes independent of ε. The entropy can then be determined if (1.2.2-6) "saturates"
with increasing m.

As a "rule of thumb", in order to be able to extract a dimension of value D from the data
the minimum size of the should be (D Ruelle)

Indeed, this follows from Eq (1.2.2-1,2) if we have 

at the lower end of the scaling region and

D

C l≈ N ­2

C u≈1

at the upper end of the scaling region, and if we require that at least εu/εs ≈ 10 for the
scaling region in order to be relevant. A somewhat more elaborate heuristic argument in

Here kmin is the minimum number of pairs of points needed for acceptable statistics, εu
and εl are the upper and lower scaling limits of the scaling region in which (1.2.2-5) is
numerically valid. 

1.2.2.1 Approximate Entropy (ApEn)

An alternative to the steps (1.2.2-1,3) in the case q = 2, is the basis for the definition of
"approximate entropy" (ApEn) (see e.g. Yang et al. 2001) proposed in 1991 (Pincus
1991) and commonly used in the study of heart beat time series (M(cid:228)kikallio et al. 1996).
In the quoted study the neighbourhood size is given in terms of a "tolerance" parameter r
(usually chosen to be about 0.2, i.e. 20 %, and with embedding dimension m = 2),

=r⋅SD

where SD is the standard deviation of the time series. In order to compute ApEn one first

which can be considered as an approximation of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy h2 of Eq
(1.1.7-4) (which implies a limit m → ∞). For large N the expression approximates the
logarithm ln(1/p) of the inverse of the conditional probability p that if two sets of m
consecutive points of the time series are close (assuming here a delay d = 1); that is, 

22/72

z k= x k , x k 1 ,... , x k m­1
and
z l= xl , xl1 ,... , xlm­1

satisfy ∣z k­ zl∣r⋅SD then we have also ∣x k m­ xlm∣r⋅SD . Thus ApEn, like the
other entropies, measures a degree of "surprise" in the data, the ability to predict the
future behaviour from past patterns. The lower the value of ApEn the more regular and
predictable is the data. For instance, in (Yang et al. 2001) they report a study of heart rate
tracing from an infant who had an aborted sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and one
from from an healthy infant. The more regular HRV-signal of the SIDS-infant corre-
sponded to a lower ApEn value of 0.826 compared with 1.426 for the healthy infant. The
authors emphasise the robustness of ApEn and that it "is not an approximation of the K-S
entropy. It is to be considered as a family of statistics and system comparisons (...) with
fixed r and m". The ApEn is said the involve some computational advantages over the
traditonal K-S entropies: less sensitive to noise, and does not require as many data points
for a valid estimate (the typical size of measured biosignals may be only around 1000
points; one rule of thumb (Pincus & Goldberger 1994) is that a reliable estimate of ApEn
(m, r) requires about 10m (cid:150) 20m points). Also its ability to differentiate between signals
with different mixes of stochastic and determinstic components is emphasized (Yang et
al. 2001 p. 82 - 83).

The study (M(cid:228)kikallio et al. 1996) found that ApEn was "significantly higher in a group
of postinfarction patients (1.21 ± 0.18) than in a group of healthy subjects (1.05 ± 0.11).
In other study (Vikman et al. 1999) a significant decrease in the ApEn was observed
before the spontaneous onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF).

1.2.2.2 Sample Entropy (SampEn)

One might observe that the "Theiler correction" (see section 1.2,2) is not implemented in
the definition of ApEn above so it includes a spurious contribution from "self-matching"
because it counts each point zm as belonging to the neighbourhood of zm. Richman and
Moorman (2000) therefore suggested an alternative definition called "Sample Entropy",
SampEn. Again, if we have scalar time series x1, ... xN, consider the m- and (m+1)-
dimensional embedding vectors

z k= x k , x k 1 ,... , x k m­1

We then define
exactly the same way using the (m+1)-dimensional vectors w
instead of z. Finally the estimate SampEn of the sample entropy (obtained in the limit of
N → ∞ ) is defined by

Thus, in the limit N → ∞ it becomes the natural logarithm of the "conditional probability
that two sequences within a tolerance r for m points remain within r of each other at the
next point". Using numerical simulations Richman and Moorman (2000) demonstrated
that the SampEn estimate may converge to a consistent value for considerably smaller
values of r and N than the approximate entropy estimate. Therefore, the SampEn estimate
promises to be less dependent on the data size.

1.2.2.3 Multiscale Entropy (MSE)

The point of departure in (Costa et al. 2002) is the general observation that a "loss of
complexity .... [is] ... a generic feature of pathological dynamics", whereas many entropy
algorithms "assign a higher value of entropy to certain pathological time series that are
presumed to represent less complex dynamics than to time series derived from healthy
function". This circumstance is attributed to the fact that these methods do not take into
consideration that the biological processes may have various structures on different time
scales. It is therefore suggested that we coarse-grain the data at different time scales and
then compute the entropy for every scale and map its dependence on the scale. Thus,
given a time series x1, ... xN, and a scale τ, we define the coarse-grained time series y(τ)
by

The choice τ= 1 reproduces the original times series. Next Costa et al. (2002) suggest we
calculate the SampEn for the coarse-grained data for a range of scales (in the paper they
calculate SampEn for τ= 1 to τ= 20 for data with 30000 points using parameters m = 2
and r = 0.15). Calculating SampEn as function of the scale is called the multiscale
entropy (MSE) analysis. The MSE analysis is expected to reveal whether the data
"contains complex structures accross multiple time scales". Thus it
is found that
(correlated) 1/f-noise has a higher entropy for scales τ > 5 than (uncorrelated) white
noise. Studying heart beat time series it was also found that for τ > 6 the healthy
individuals showed higher entropy than subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF) and subjects
with congestive heart failure (CHF). At τ= 1 on the other hand the entropy for healthy
and CHF coincided at a value much less than the entropy for AF.

1.2.3 Nonlinear prediction and modelling

For deterministic systems the future can in principle be predicted from past data. Deter-
ministic chaos puts limitations on the range of meaningful prediction. Numerical
predictions of weather may be of a range of one week. Our planetary system is expected

24/72

to exhibit chaos on the time scale of some 5 million years (beyond that we cannot give
reliable prediction about the whereabouts of the planetary orbits -  for a popular review of
the topic of the (in)stability of the solar system see Peterson 1995). A general implication
of determinism is that points close in phase space are mapped on close points by the flow
Ft, for t > 0 sufficiently small. In terms of an embedded time series, if zp and zq are close,
then we expect also their time shifts zp+1 and zq+1 to be close. A simple prediction
algorithm is based on this is called the Lorenz method - Lorenz did indeed suggest the
method. As an (non practical) analogy we may think of weather forecasting. Suppose we
have huge record of historical weather data. Knowing the temperature, windiness,
cloudiness, etc, of the present day (and for a few days back), we may browse the past
record in order to find days (or periods) with similar weather patterns in the past. We
then look up how the weather in the past evolved from there on a few days ahead into the
future and use that as a prediction for how the weather will be tomorrow etc. 

A very simple example (m = 1) is the one given by the Ulam-series above. Thus given a
number 0 < wk < 1 in a similar (unknown) series we may ask what will its next value wk+1
= F(wk) (F is supposed to be unknown). We chose a neighbourhood size ε and collect all
the terms zn of a known series within the distance ε of wk. The average of their time shift
will then be the prediction for wk+1.

Of course this procedure can be used for predicting more than one step ahead into the
future. Conversely this method of prediction can be used to test the time series them-
selves in two ways. To beging with we divide the time series in two parts; one used for
calculating the predictions, and one part used for checking the predictions so that we can
calculate the error of the prediction. Now we can use this setup for determining a
minimum embedding dimension m. We compute the error of prediction using m = 1,
2, ....  If m is less than the degrees of freedom (d.f.) of the dynamical system the error will
be large. However, when we reach m ≥ d.f. there will be a slump in the size of the error.
However, if the error of prediction throughout is no less than if we had made the
predictions by "tossing coins" our assumption of a determinstic process is most likely
wrong. Thus, the prediction procedure also provides a method for probing whether the
time series is deterministic to beging with (Kennel & Isabelle 1992).

Though the simple prediction algorithm (1.2.3-1) suffices for many purposes, more
sophistcated prediction algorithms can be devised by locally approximating the dynamics
using e.g. polynomial functions pi(z), i = 1, ..., M. Given a point yk in the embedding
space, then the idea is that its time shift  yk+1 can be obtained by a function of the form 

(2)

M

y k 1=∑

i=1

c i , k  pi  y k 

 

Thus, Eq (1.2.3-2) constitutes a model of the dynamics. The coeffcients c(i, k) are
calculated using the standard least square method (LSM). We form the set Sk of points of

25/72

the embedded time series in an ε-neighbourhood of the point yk and then we determine
the coefficients c(i, k) such that the squared error

(3)

is minimized. These coefficients will then be used in Eq (1.2.3-2) for predicting yk+1.
They constitute a local model of the dynamics around yk. The next step yk+2 is predicted
using a local model around yk+1, obtained in the previous step, etc. The root mean square
error of this forecast, after L steps, is estimated to grow as (Abarbanel 1996)

N is the number of data, P is the maximum order of the approximation polynomials pi, λ1
is the maximum Lyapunov exponent, and mL is the embedding dimension (it can be less if
one employs the so called principal component analysis to be discussed below). The
sceond factor in (1.2.3-4) is exactly what we expect from the definition of the Lyapunov
exponent.

An interesting application of the prediction algorithms is in the study of a possible
nonstationarity of a time series. Suppose we divide the time series into subdivisions Ji
and then use the data in Jk to predict the data in Ji and thereafter compute the correspond-
ing squared mutual prediction errors ek,i (see Kantz & Schreiber 1997 § 4.4). If ek,i
changes significantly as we move away from the diagonal (i = k) this is a sign of a
changed dynamics (nonstationarity); that is, the same dynamic rule does not apply to the
whole data set.

1.2.4 Noise reduction

Experimental data is always contaminated by noise or other unwanted influences. A clas-
sical method of noise separation, filtering, is based on Fourier-spectrum analysis. The
simplest version is the use e.g. of a low pass filter. It is assumed that the spectrum of the
noise (e.g. high frequency vibrations) resides mainly above a certain frequency fu. The
signal is then denoised by dropping all the frequency components with frequency f > fu.
In recent decades wavelet analysis has become an important tool also in signal analysis
complementing the Fourier-analysis. The denoising principles in wavelet analysis are
similar to the ones in the Fourier case but one operates on the wavelet coefficients instead
of the Fourier-coefficients of the signal. Nonlinear time series analysis provides some
novel noise reduction algorithms. The simplest one is based on averaging. Let us explain
it in the case m = 3 for a time series xn. Given xk it will be replaced by an average value
calculated as follows: Let Sk be the set of all embedded vectors zi in an ε-neighbourhood
of  (xk-1, xk, xk+1). Compute the local average

(1)

and finally replace xk with xk obtained from z=x k ­1 , x k , x k 1
in Eq (1.2.4-1). This
method corresponds to the averaging of the vector field f determining the dynamics in Eq
(1.1.1-4); that is, one averages the flow over a small neighbourhood at every point in the
reconstructed phase space. The hope is of course that the random fluctuations will
average out. Typically the noise reduction procedure is iterated up to about eight times
with decreasing ε. The effect of the noise reduction can be assessed by comparing the
predicability of the cleaned data with that of the original data as described in the previous
section 1.2.3.

If we think of the attractor as a surface S in Rm, then the effect of noise is typically to
spread the points above and below this surface. This suggests that noise reduction can be
viewed as a geometrical problem of reconstructing the surface from its bloated version.
One solution to this problem is the local projective denoising method.
It is based on
approximating the dynamics locally by linear maps. Geometrically it means that we
approximate locally the orbit (attractor) by its tangent space. The noise spreads the point
below and above the "true" tangent space. In the projective noise reduction method we
try to determine the local tangent space and project the points in the neighbourhood,
which have drifted away, back on to the tangent space. Thus, in the cleaned data the
points are replaced by their local projections. If m0 is the smallest integer equal to or
larger than the dimension of the attractor, and the data is embedded in a space of
dimension m > m0, then we may suppose that the noise effects a drifting of the points
evenly in the q = m - m0 orthonormal directions ai of the "null space". The projection
onto the tangent space is then given by

P  z =z­∑

 z⋅ai ai

q

i=1

Again we invoke the least square method in order to determine the orthonormal vectors
ai of the null space. Indeed, we determine ai such that the squares of the distances of the
points in the neighbourhood from the tangent space will be a minimum; this is a generali-
zation of the usual linear regression method of fitting a straight line to set of points and is
the content of the principal component analysis (PCA). The point of PCA is reduce the
dimension of the data space to a subspace where its main variation resides. Now, our
problem is reformulated as the minimization of the expression

with respect to the vectors ai. The last term (2) is due to the constraint that the vectors ai

(here zr denotes the r:th co-ordinate of the point z in Rm). The vectors ai correspond to the

is modified by replacing z above in Eqs (2-4) with its deviation from the local average

The point of the weighing matrix is to suppress the contributions by the end co-ordinates
of the embedding vectors because they accumulate the greater part of the instabilities. A
point xk of the times series is part of m embedded vectors

and those of them where xk is in the middle of the embedding vector will be emphasized
using (6) by weighting the correction to xk from the embedding vectors (7) with 1/R (see
Eq (9)). The projective correction replaces the embedding vector zn with

The nonlinear denoising algorithms described above are of the "blind" type. No knowl-
edge is presupposed about the details of the dynamics. This is typically the case in

28/72

biological applications. In physical laboratory experiments the situation may be different
if one probes accurately modelled systems. Then one can use the explicit model of the
dynamics in devising the denoising algorithm (see e.g. Abarbanel 1995 ch. 7). Similarily,
if one has a clean sample of a signal generated by the source one can use this for a
statistical denoising of its contaminated signals.

An interesing and successful application of the nonlinear projective noise reduction
method is presented in (Hegger et al. 2000). They show that the method works on
denoising human speech signals though such signals are neither deterministic nor station-
ary. However, it seems as if the speech signals were approximately deterministic and low
dimensional on the phoneme level. In the example cited the authors used embedding
dimensions of the order 20 - 30 and a projection to a low dimensional subspace (q in the
range of 3 to 7). The neighbourhood size was chosen so as to guarantee 5 to 20 neigh-
bours in the sets Sk above. The large embedding dimensions made the method quite
resilient with respect to the noise.

Denoising can be used for signal separation. Suppose a signal is superposed by a weaker
background signal. Consider first the background signal as "disturbance" and clean it
away by denoising the signal. Finally, retrieve the weak signal by subtracting the cleaned
signal from the original signal and denoise it. Schreiber and Kaplan (1996) have used this
method together with the projective denoising method for separating mother and foetus
ECG. This method works with data from only one channel, whereas e.g. the independent
component analysis (ICA) (Hyv(cid:228)rinen & Oja 1999) may require several channels of
recordings in order to separate signals by combining inputs from e.g. different locations.

1.2.5 Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)

Many signals of biological origin exhibit an absence of characteristic temporal and/or
spatial scales (see e.g. Hastings & Sugihara 1993; Schroeder 1991). Thus it might be that
a process x(t) and its time-scaled version x(at) have the same statistics (averages,
variances etc) if we rescale the signal itself too:

(1)

x t  =d 1 
a H

⋅x at 

The meaning of the "distributional equvivalence" Eq (1) is that1 the probabilities satisfy
the scaling relation 

(1*)

Prob x t x=Prob 1 

a H x at x .

A robust method for studying such fractal (or self-similar) behaviours of signals was
introduced by Peng et al. (1994) called the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The
property (1,1*) implies that the variance scales as

1 For a discussion of this statistical equivalence concept see Beran (1994) p. 50. A process that satisfies

(1) is said to be H-self-similar (H-ss).

(< > denotes averaging over the orbit or a great number of runs). Here σ2 is called the
variance and using the common assumption that x(0) = 0 we have in general for the
second moment2

(2*)

〈 x t 2 〉= 2 ∣t∣2 H

In principle the parameter H can be determined from empirical data by calculating the
logarithm of the LHS of (2) for a series of
time differences ∆ and plot it against the
logarithm of ∆. The DFA-method modifies this procedure. First, it is not the signal x
itself which is used but its integral3 defined by (for discrete signals)

Secondly, suppose the size of the data is N. Then we divide the integrated data y into
nonoverlapping blocks of size n < N. For every such block we determine its linear least-
square fit, which together define a picewise linear curve yn. Subtracting this from y we
get a "detrended" signal, and the "fluctuation" at level n will be defined by

If  x  satisfies the scaling property (1,2) then F[n] will follow a "power law"

(5)

F [n] ∝ n

The exponent α in Eq (5) is termed the self-similarity parameter. Generally, a higher α-
value implies a more regular time series. It is related to the Hurst parameter H defined by
Eq (2). Since integration raises scaling exponents of the signal by one, the Hurst parame-
ter and the self-similarity parameter are related by (for fractal Brownian motion)

There is a characteristic difference between signals with 0 < H < 0.5 and H > 0.5. The
former
is connected with
the changes x(t + ∆t) (cid:150) x(t) and
persistence. Persistence means that for time intervals ∆t
x(t) - x(t - ∆t) tend to have the same sign (changes enforce themselves), while in the case
of anti-persistence they tend have opposite signs (changes provoke changes in the
opposite direction). More precisely, define ρ-correlation -1 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 for a time scale ∆t  by

〈 x t2   t ­ x t 2  〉 = const.⋅2 2 H∣ t ∣2

H

Combining this with (11) and (2) we obtain

(13)

2 1 =22 H
0 H 1

From this we indeed see that the ρ-correlation (11) is negative for H < 0.5. Zero ρ-
correlation corresponds to the "classical" Brownian random walk. The Hurst exponent
can also be directly related to the fractal dimension D of the graph (t, x(t)) of the time
series in the plane by (see e.g. Hastings & Sugihara 1993)5

(14)

D = 2 (cid:150) H

Thus the Brown time series x(t) (H = 0.5) has the fractal dimension D = 3/2. Fractal time
series can furthermore be characterised by their zero-crossing probabilities. Suppose we
have x(0) = x0, then what is the probability that x(t) > x0 for 0 < t < T and x(T) = x0? The
probability density can be shown (Ding & Yang 1995) to be related to the fractal dimen-
sion D and is inversely proportional the Dth power in T:

(15)

 

P T ∝T ­D

a relation that has also been used for numerically determining the fractal dimension D
and thus the Hurst exponent for long time series (Liebovitch & Yang 1997).

Numerous studies have applied DFA to heart beat interval data. In one study it was found
(see Peng et al. 2000) that for a group of people with no known heart problems the self-
similarity parameter α was about 1.0 ± 0.1 whereas for a heart failure group it was about
1.24 ± 0.22. 

1.2.5.1 Disgression: Fourier transform and power laws

For a continuous6 stationary stochastic process x(t) we define the power spectrum S(f) by

(1)

〈 x  f  x v〉= f ­v S v 

5 Heuristically, when covering the curve with boxes of reduced size ∆x/2 the number of boxes N(∆x/2)

must be increased on the average, due to (1, 12), by a factor of 21-H as compared to the case of a smooth
line (H = 1); this gives N(∆x/2) = 22-H N(∆x) and thus D = 2 (cid:150) H (by the definition (1.1.6-3) ).
6 In the discrete versions the Dirac-delta functions are replaced by Kronecker-deltas and a constant

dimensional factor.

32/72

(in time domain this is equivalent to 

(1*)

〈 x  s x t 〉=g  s­t 

where g(t) is the Fourier-inverse of  S(f).) From this we obtain for the correlation function

that is, the Fourier transform of the correlation function C(τ) is equal to the power
spectrum,

(2)

c  f =S  f 

.

If we take the inverse Fourier transform of a power spectrum of the variety (1.2.5-9) we
arrive at an expression of the form

In the case 0 < β< 1 the integral is convergent and by making the variable substitution

showing that c(τ) scales as τβ - 1. 

Spectrum power law with β= 1 is a special case. The corresponding time series is called
pink noise (or flicker), or simply 1/f-noise, and has drawn a lot of interest from research-
ers (see e.g. Mandelbrot 1999). In order to calculate the correlation function for the 1/f-
noise we will calculate the difference c(τ2) (cid:150) c(τ1) in terms of the integral

(5)

c =∫

Thus, for pink noise the correlation function C(τ) varies as the logarithm ln(1/τ) (plus a
"calibration constant" C(1)).

The above procedure of introducing a lower cut-off ε for the frequency can also be
interpreted in terms of the renormalization procedures used in physics. Another approach
is based on calculating the Fourier transform of the so-called principal value of 1/| f | in
terms of distributions (generalized functions). For a discussion see Saichev and Woyc-
zyæski (1997), p. 126 (cid:150) 130. For β> 1 Eq (3) defines a divergent integral and introducing
a cut-off produces a somewhat arbitrary results in contrast to the β= 1 case. For βin the
range 1 < β< 3 we may instead "renormalize" (3) by subtracting the infinite constant c(0)
from it thus obtaining a convergent integral

The fractal Brownian process (1.2.5-2,2*) is not a stationary process since the correlation

This is interpreted as a sort of "averaged" power spectrum for the fractal Brownian
motion (Flandrin 1992, 2002). 

After this mathematical exercise it is to be emphasized that we may hardly expect real
data to adhere to the pure models of fractal noise or motion8. Selfsimilarity in nature is
only possible over a restricted range of scales due e.g. to the discrete constitution of
matter. Therefore it is advisably to use complementary methods when e.g. trying to
extract Hurst exponents from the data (see e.g. Eke et al. 2000).

8 "If course, true fBm are unlikely to be observed in natural phenomena, but the fBm model offers an
extremely powerful idealization and a very convenient starting point for studying statistically self-
similar processes, as does, for example, white noise in the case of stationary processes." (Flandrin
1998).

1.2.5.2 Rescaled Range Analysis (R/S)

This method for studying power laws of time series goes back to Hurst (1951). Suppose
we have time series xi, i = 1, ... , N and divide it into m blocks with n = N/m points each.
For each 1 ≤ j ≤ m define the vectors,

and the "accumulation"

where    j

 is the average of the vector ξj. One then defines the range Rj(n) as 

(4)

R j n=max k z j [ k ]­mink z j [ k ]

 

and the scale Sj(n) as the standard deviation of ξj . The final range R(n) for the time series
and for the block-size n is defined as the average of (4) over j. Similarily for the scale S
(n). It was then the observed by Hurst that the so called rescaled adjusted range R(n)/S(n)
for his data tended to scale as a power of the block size n,

The relationship (5) can be argumented for if we assume a scaling property (1.2.5-1) for
the data (Beran 1994 § 4.2). The R/S method may be useful for preliminary visual inspec-
tion possible long-memory trends in the data but it is not considered trustworthy for
automated analysis.

lacking theoretical support, suggests a method for estimating the Hurst exponent from

Vandewalle and Ausloos. Inspired by these results Alessio et al. (2002) proposed to

These theoretical results suggest that the "dispersion methods" are well adapted for
extracting the Hurst-exponents if the generation mechanism of the data indeed has fractal
properties. However, Raymond and Bassingthwaighte (1999) emphasize that the variance
sample method is only adapted for fGn, whereas the scaled windowed variance should be
applied to fBm, otherwise the analysis might result in errors. Thus, one must be able to
first test to which group the data belongs in order to be able to choose the right method of
analysis (Eke et al. 2000).

1.2.6 Surrogate data

"Surrogate data testing attempts to find

the least interesting explanation that

cannot be ruled out based on the data."

(Schreiber & Schmitz 1999)

Above we discussed methods for testing for determinsm for instance by checking
whether there is predicability in time series or not. This may be quite simple for strongly
determinstic signals. However, we may have signals that are heavily cluttered with noise
and we whish to know if there are residues of determinstic or nonlinear processes that
can be traced in the signal. This problem can be formulated as hypothesis testing. The

39/72

null hypothesis H0 might be that the signal is generated by a linear gaussian process
(ARMA, Auto Regression and Moving Average)

(1)

xn=a0∑

ai xn­i∑

b j n­ j

M AR

i=1

M MA

j=0

where ηj designate gaussian independent stochastic variables. The coeffcients ai and bj
determine the power spectrum and the correlation function of the generated signal which
have to agree with that computed from the measurement data. Using several sets of
surrogate data one may compute the values of the estimator λ as sequence of nonlinear
parameters λi, the estimator λ may e.g be the correlation dimension D2, and compare
them with that computed from the measurement data, λ0. If λ0 lies outside, or at the edge
of the set λi, we might try to estimate the chance that the null hypothesis is false (see e.g.
Kantz & Schreiber 1997). One estimator that has been found to be quite reliable is the
prediction error (see section 1.2.3). Thus, in a ("non parametric") statistical test where we
use the prediction error as the estimator and we choose the probability, that we might
reject H0 though it is in fact true, to be α(typically chosen as 0.05), we have to design a
number of 1/α(cid:150) 1 sets of surrogate data. If for any of these the prediction error is less
than for the original data we cannot rule out the null hypothesis given the preset
confidence level of 1 - α. Approximate entropy ApEn discussed in section 1.2.2.1 could
also be a candidate for a robus estimator but no systematic investigation seems to have
been undertaken regarding this yet.

Demonstraing that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected on the basis of the given
evidence does of course not prove that the dynamics is really that of linear gaussian
process. The point is rather that the available evidence does not allow us, with the meth-
ods at hand, to extract any more subtle structures from the data. For example, few believe
that the brain is a linear gaussian process even if the brain waves may have the character-
istics of such processes.

A simple method for fabricating surrogate data is the phase randomization. For a time
series xn we compute the Fourier coeffcients

We then define new coeffcients by multiplying the old coeffcients ck with complex unit

n has the same spectrum and correlation function as the original

and the correlation function is obtained as the Fourier inverse of the power spectrum.
Thus methods based on spectrum and the correlation function cannot distinguish a series
and its phase randomised variant. Phase randomised data has been used to the test the
null hypothesis of linear gaussian process. A more general null hypothesis is obtained if
we allow for the possiblilty that the signal is a static nonlinear transformation s(xn) of a
linear gaussian process xn. For "nice" forms of the transformation s (i.e. s is invertible and
close to identity) we can test
this hypothesis by fabricating surrogate data using
Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform (AAFT) (see Schreiber & Schmitz 1999). A very
simple procedure is to test for the (somewhat crude) null hypothesis that the data is
generated by picking numbers randomly from a set (cid:150) in this case one creates surrogate
data by reshuffling the measurement data in a random way. 

Since ARMA processes are time symmetric whereas most nonlinear systems of interest
are dissipative one may also use methods for detecting time reversiblilty as a way to to
test the null hypothesis of a linear stochastic process. A popular estimator in this case is
the 3d order correlation

1.2.6.1 Diks' estimator

Diks (see Diks 1999) presents a somewhat more advanced method for testing time
reversibility which also covers static nonlinear transformations of the linear gaussian
processes. The time inversion transformation P is defined by

(1)

P  x1 ,... , x n= x n ,... , x1

The time reversibility is then formulated in terms of the map P and the reconstruction
measure µ. The measure µ is defined in the embedding dimension m by the equivalence

P =

( P  is defined by P  A= P­1 A
for any set A∈Rm .) The idea is then to find
an estimator which measures the difference between µ and P µ. For this Diks constructs a

where the kernel K is chosen to be, for some positive number d (called bandwidth),

ties whence wij (and therefore
m = 3, d = 0.2 and T >> m. One modification (the block method) of this procedure in
order to reduce the fluctuations of the results is to replace wij by its average over blocks
of the size l × l. An interesting point is that for non reversible series the Diks’ estimator S
tends to grow with the length of the time series which thus amplifies the discriminatory
power of the method. As a rule of thumb, if the null hypothesis is correct then 

Prob(S  > 3) < 0.05. 

Applying this method to the Wolf sunspot data (using delay = 1, m = 3, d = 0.2, T = l = 8)
Diks obtained S = 5.78 "which provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that the
time series is reversible" (Diks 1999 p. 71). A similar analysis of a financial time series
(difference of logarithm of IBM stock price, log(xn) (cid:150) log(xn-1)) resulted in S = 1.55 which
does not rule out reversibility (which is expected from the random walk models).

2. Physical models

2.1 Human balance

2.1.1 Force plate design

Standing and walking involve a complex neurophysiological control system. That neuro-
logical or muscular disorder may manifest themselves in abnormal patterns in posture
and balance is obvious. Making quantitative measurements of the variations in posture
remained a technical challenge however. Systematic studies of human stance seems to
have begun only with Karl von Vierordt around 1860. Vierordt affixed a feather on the
head of his subjects above of which was a sheet covered with lampblack (fine soot).

43/72

When the subject moved, the feather inscribed a trajectory on the sheet. An electronic
force plate was constructed by a French professor J Scherrer in 1952. In the 1980’s the
computer entered the game, used both for data acquisition and analysis. Force was
measured with sensors based on pressure gauges or piezo-electric components. The
international society of posturography was founded in Amsterdam in 1969 (International
Society of Posturography). Posturology seems to be a most active field in countries such
as France, Italy and Japan. For some historical tidbits see Gagey & Bizzo (www2001). A
good survey of theoretical, experimental and clinical aspects of postural control can be
found in Shumway-Cook and Woollacott (2001). 

In quiet standing the centre of mass (CM) of the subject makes what seems an erratic
bounded trajectory. Suppose the person stands on a rectangular plate supported by force
transducers at the corners. The transducers pick up the vertical component of the pressure
and we may denote these forces by F1, ..., F4. Knowing the locations of the transducers
we can calculate the centre of pressure (COP). Let the y-axis be in the anterior-posterior
direction, and the x-axis along the medial-lateral direction. If sensors are placed at the
corners with the co-ordinates (± a, ± b) then the co-ordinates of the COP are given by

It can be pointed out here that the subtractions of the forces in (1) help also to cancel
external perturbations common to all the transcducers. The sum F1 + F2 + F3 + F4
should be almost constant and equal to the weight (W) of the person. The accuracy of the
transducers are usually given as percentage p of the nominal load (Fmax). Practical
measurements seem to indicate that p Fmax is the standard deviation of the error of the
transducer (the square root of the variance of the fluctuations around the mean value for a
constant load). If we assume that errors from the different transducers are statistically
independent we can estimate the errors in the COP co-ordinates to be

 y=2   b

For instance, precision force transducers may have p = 0.02 % ( = 0.0002). Thus, if we
use 100 kg sensors (Fmax ≈ 1000 N) and the person has a body mass of 70 kg, and a = 300
mm, then we find the error (in the sense of standard deviation) δ x to be of the order of
0.17 mm. Using a 16-bit AD-card interfacing the computer the influence of the AD-errors
on the total error becomes in this case negligible ( p > 2-16 ). The error of 0.17 mm can be
compared to typical amplitudes of the sways which are of the order of 10 (cid:150) 20 mm.

2.1.2 COP versus CM

44/72

In static equilibrium the CM and the COP would lie on the same vertical line (i.e. COP
would coincide with the projection of the CM onto the x-y plane). This can be illustrated
using a simple model, the inverted pendulum (Winter at al. 1998), for the anterior-
posterior balance. Here we take the vertical direction as the z-axis. The pendulum rotates
around the ankle joint which we take as the origin in the y-z system. Denote by F the
total force acting on the foot by the force plate at the point (-ζ, η) which is the COP.
Finally  we denote the CM co-ordinates by (y, z). 

From Newton’s equations we obtain (L is the the distance between CM and the ankle
joint, I  is the moment of inertia, m is the body mass minus feet mass)

The component Fz is the same force as is obtained from the readings of the force trans-
ducers. For small deviations around the z-axis we may replace cos(φ) by y/L and as a first
approximation we may also set Fz = mg9, then we obtain from (1)

Thus the difference between the projection of the CM and the COP on the y-axis is
proportional to the second derivative of the CM co-ordinate y. We can estimate the dif-

9 Actually the beating of the heart, among other things, causes a fluctuation in the vertical force, typically
with an amplitude of the order of 3 - 8 Newtons, which is about the order of  1% of the person’s weight

which can be estimated to be typically around 1/3 Hz for adults. From (3) it is apparent
that the CM co-ordinate y is a filtered version of the COP co-ordinate η. This is
physically obvious because it
takes more energy to move a bigger mass whence
vibrations transmitted to a big mass are damped. For slow motions with frequencies f
below fc
the co-ordinates y and η trace out almost identical curves, but the high
frequency components f > fc are suppressed in the CM y co-ordinate. If we express (3)
in the time domain then the smeared nature of the CM co-ordinate becomes even clearer:

(5)

Thus, y(t) is η(s) "averaged" over a time interval whose characteristic size is typically of
the order 1/(2 π fc) ∼ 0.5 seconds. Apparently (5) is a non causal filter. However, it is
equivalent to the solution of the initial value problem given by

as t → – ∞. Indeed, given this
condition and inserting η into the integral (5) using (2) it will yield y after partial
integrations. 

2.1.3 Stiffness hypothesis

An complementary analysis can be formulated in terms of stiffness hypothesis (Winter et
al. 1998) which supposes that a deviation by an angle αfrom the vertical is opposed by
muscular torque K⋅ αaround the ankle joint, with K as the "spring constant". This must
be equal to ηFz + ζFy in (2.1.2-1) otherwise there would be a nonzero total torque acting
on the foot making it rotate. With α = π/2 (cid:150) φ  ≈  y/L  we thus obtain

The last term on the RHS of (1) may be of the order 10-4 times smaller than first one
whence y is quite nearly proportional to η and thus in phase with it. In terms of the angle
α we further obtain the equation (inverted pendulum with a restoring spring)

Accordingly, if the maximum velocity of sway is v0 we can predict the amplitude y0 of
the sway to be 

Conversely, knowing y0 and v0 from measurements we can estimate fn and the "stiffness
constant" K. In the cited study they were able to independently measure the COM co-
ordinate y using markers and optical trackers. Then by determining the angle α≈ y/L and
the restoring torque M = mgη they were able to establish a relation (linear regression
typically with R2 = 0.954) between αand M and calculate the stiffness constant from K =
dM/dα. Average values obtained by (Winter et al., 2001) for the stiffness (anterior/
posterior) was about 430 N m/rad per ankle joint. Further evidence for the stiffness- and
inverted pendulum modell for the balance mechanism is presented in (Winter et al. 2003).
The stiffness modell implies a passive balance control mechanism. Indeed, Winter at al.
(2003) found that CM and COP are almost in phase, lagging only by about 4 ms, whereas
afferent and efferent latencies are of the order of 50 (cid:150) 70 ms and delays in muscle tension
are about 70 - 100 ms. 

Without the K-term the Eq (2) of course describes an unstable situation (the inverted
pendulum topples over). Adding the stiffness term K > mgL is the simplest way of
stabilising the system (a frictional term would also be needed in order for the system to
settle down in the position α= 0). Very likely there is a corresponding mechanism in the
nature, at least as a linear approximation of a more complicated restoration force. The
stiffness model does however not explain the random walk characteristics (Collins & De
Luca 1994) of quiet standing. The figure below shows the sways in medial-lateral
direction in terms of COP (in mm along the y-axis in he graph) in a 15 seconds trial. The
dotted line is the average position mean(y). 

47/72

2.1.4 Random walk in quiet standing

That there is a random component in the swaying during quiet standing seems to be well
established (Collins & De Luca 1994; Duarte & Zatsiorsky 2000), but to what extent this
randomness is due to deterministic chaos or some stochastic influence is not settled.
Viewing the posturogram as a fractal curve and calculating its Hurst exponent there
seems to be a critical value for the size of time interval ∆t around 1 sec (cmp Eq (1.2.5-
12)) such that the Hurst exponent calculated for ∆t < 1 sec tend to be larger than 0.5
while for time intervals ∆t > 1 sec it tend to be smaller than 0.5. (The analysis of
posturograms in terms of random walk and fractal properties is called stabilogram
diffusion analysis, SDF, in the litterature.) This would mean that we have persistence for
small time intervals and antipersistence for large time intervals. Indeed, for short time
intervals we may suppose that the inertia will tend to keep the body moving in one
direction. On the other hand the motion is bounded (otherwise the person topples over)
whence for longer time intervals there will be a rebounding of the motion in the opposite
direction. Thus, qualitatively the inertia and the boundedness seem to imply the
persistence and antipersistence regimes of the swaying. It is simple to extend the Eq
(2.1.3-2) with a stochastic term so as to get the random walk signature of the swaying. A
somewhat more detailed model (still based on the inverted pendulum) has been presented
by Peterka (2000) in terms of PID-control systems known from engineering (see e.g.
Khoo (2000) for a physiological context of these methods). Basically it’s an ARMA-
process. We present the model here in the familiar form of a differential equation (we
have dropped a time delay used in the original formulation since it does not seem to
affect the results for this model):

as a lowpass filter with a characteristic frequency 1/τf. We quote typical parameter values

Using Eq (2.1.2-3) we obtain the Fourier transform of the COP co-ordinate ηfrom that of
α. The figure below shows a simulated example of COP trajectory η(t) (solid line) and
CM trajectory y(t) (dotted line) in millimeters along the vertical axis and with time
(seconds) along the horizontal axis. This result was obtained by the Fourier transform
method described above using the time step ∆t = 0.01 s. (An artefact of the Fourier
method is that the trajectory always ends and starts at the same value due to the
periodicity of the sinus and cosinus functions in the Fourier expansion. For unbiased
statistics one may use only parts of the simulated curve.)

There is much less dramatic change in the spectrum of the COP co-ordinate. Still if we
compute the slope -βof its spectrum (in the log-log graph) for the section f < fn (βl, for
long time) and the section f  > fn (βs, for short time) we obtain in this example

with the corresponding Hurst exponents (see Eq (1.2.5-10))

βl ≈ 1.685

βs ≈ 2.249

Hl ≈ 0.343

Hs ≈ 0.624

Thus, the model seems to be able to describe the observed persistence for short time
intervals (Hs > 0.5) and the antipersistence for long time intervals (Hl < 0.5). Whether
such a PID-control scheme is realised in nature is an open issue. The nervous system may
rely on inputs from e.g. muscle spindles, joint receptors, vestibular sensors in the inner
ear (semicircular canals, otolithic organs), gravity receptors in the trunk, plus visual cues.
Also it has to be pointed out that the inverted pendulum model is only a first approxima-
tion. Especially elder people tend to control the stance using the so-called "hip strategy";
i.e., shifting the position of the CM by bending the body.

2.1.5 Disgression: Random walk with relaxation

Apparent different "scaling regimes" may seem to result when one combines random
walk with a friction term as in the following simple model (see e.g. Hastings & Sugihara
1993) which is a Langevin-equation on differential form:

Here the increment dB represents uncorrelated noise with zero mean. The formal solution
with10 x(0) = 0 can be written as

(8)

〈 x t t  – x t 2 〉=2  2 ⋅1  – e­r  t

Compare this with the definition of the Hurst exponent H in Eq (1.2.5-12). Apparently,
for ∆t << 1/r we have H ∼ 0.5; for ∆t ∼ 1/r one might obtain a value 0 < H < 0.5, and
finally for ∆t >> 1/r the Hurst exponent H would be concluded to be close to zero. Thus

52/72

we may expect different "scaling regimes" if one calculates the Hurst exponent from the
data without regard to whether there is a real scaling or not. In this model there is a true
scaling regime only for short time intervals. We can also look at the situation from the
frequency point of view. Eq (3) implies that the correlation C(τ) is proportional to exp(- r
|τ|) whose Fourier transform is

(long times) the spectrum is almost constant (β = 0 in
Thus, for small frequencies
which case the Hurst exponent is undefined), whereas for large frequencies (short times)
the power spectrum approaches 1/f2. If we calculate the correlation ρ defined by Eq

which implies anti-persistence for all time scales ∆t. 

2.1.6 Some Parameters Used in Posturography

Using the data of the COP-trajectory one can calculate a number of parameters with the
intent characterizing "good" or "poor" balance. Broadly speaking we have three groups of
parameters (Chiari et al. 2002). The (space-)time-domain parameters, the frequency-
domain parameters, and the stochastic-nonlinear parameters. Classical
time-domain
parameters are the length of the COP-trajectory and the area covered by the COP-
trajectory. The "length" 

L=∑

 x [ k ] – x [ k ­1]2  y [ k ] – y [ k ­1]2 

k

naturally depends - considering the raggy and fractal characteristics of the trajectory - on
the sampling time interval ∆t = tk (cid:150) tk-1. For small intervals noise will give a spurious
contribution to the length. A convenient choice is using ∆t = 0.2 sec for calculating the
length which accords with the old standard of using a sampling rate of 5 Hz. With this
value the noise is effectively suppressed. 

53/72

Length as a function of the time interval. Red curve
based on raw data sampled at 1000 Hz and replaced by
10-point average data with 100 samples per second, blue
curve based on the same data but low-pass filtered with
cut-off frequency at 20 Hz. Data from a 52 second test
eyes open.

A standard measure of area is obtained by calculating the area of the 90%-confidence
ellipse for the x and y-data of the COP-trajectory. Of interest is also the inclination of the
ellipse. Other "obvious" parameters are the mean velocities and the standard deviations
of the velocities in the A/P and M/L-directions. Among frequency-domain parameters we
have mean the frequencies for the spectrum of the A/P and M/L motion. Examples of
stochastic parameters are the Hurst parameters and the power spectrum exponent β
discussed in section 2.1.4. A higher β-value is generally associated with a smoother curve
since the high-frequency part is suppressed. In a sense a smaller β-value signifies a more
"complex" curve. These types of parameters are of increasing significance since they
seem to be able to capture features that are hard to detect using the time-domain
parameters (Thurner, Mittermaier and Ehrenberger 2002). The quoted study reports e.g.
that data for groups of elderly show on the average significantly higher β-values than for
a group of young people. We have also implemented entropy parameters such as
approximate entropy but it is too early to tell whether they are useful in this context.

2.2 Analysis of EMG (ElectroMyoGram) 

2.2.1 Neuromuscular Basics

That there is connection between electricity and muscle activity was discovered by
Luiggi Galvani already in 1781. Jan Swammerdam hade made similar experiments more
than a century earlier (1664) but it is unclear whether he was aware of the role of the
electricity in his experiments. A more detailed study of the phenomenon had to wait for
developments in anatomy, microscopy and electronics (for historical tidbits see e.g. the
introductory chapter in Malmivuo and Plonsey 1995). Skeletal muscles are composed of
muscle fibres controlled by the somatomotor nervous system. The muscles exert force
when the fibres are contracting. The contraction is effected by the action potentials (AP),
descended from an alpha-motoneuron, which generate muscle fibre action potentials,

54/72

MAP, which travels in both directions from the motor end platea along the fibres. The
action potential along the motoneuron dendrites travels much faster, around 60 m/s, than
the muscle action potential along the fibre which may travel with a velocity around 4 m/s.
An alpha-motoneuron may control anything from only a few muscle fibres to thousands
of muscle fibres (when only gross control of the movements is needed). The alpha-
motoneuron, its junctions and the muscle fibres it innervates, are collectively called a
motor unit, MU. Motoneurons that end up on the same muscle constitute a motor pool. If
electrodes are inserted into the muscle they may record a sum of the fibre action
potentials, whose waveform is called the motor unit action potential, MUAP. For a
sustained contraction the alpha-motoneuron has to emit a train of action potentials,
causing a similar train of motor unit action potentials, MUAPT. The intensity of the
contractions is determined by the firing rate of the alpha-motoneuron. A few random
elements are involved in the neuromotoric process. For example, the release of the
acetylcholine (ACh) packets at the neuromuscular junctions is a random discharge
causing a random excitation of the muscle fibres called jitter. Generally the fibers in a
motor unit are activated simultaneously (save for the shifting delays due to varying
lengths of the dendritic connections from the motoneuron), but sometimes some of the
fibers fail to fire which also adds to the randomness of the total potential.

For surface muscles it is possible to detect a gross electrical activity (the recorded signal
is called a surface electromyogram, sEMG) of the muscles using surface electrodes. This
technique was pioneered by H Piper back in 1912. The amplitude of the muscular action
potential is of the order from a few µV to 1000 µV. The frequency content of the MAP is
in the range from a few Hz to 10 kHz, but due to filtering by skin, fat, etc., the sEMG is
believed to contain relevant information only up to about 500 Hz. The part below 20 Hz
is usually filtered out because it may contain motion artefacts and traces from the electro-
cardiac potentials. Surface EMG usually records the superposition of MAPs from many
motor units and may also contain crosstalk from other muscles. Using arrays of
electrodes it may be possible to isolate individual motor unit components. For a standard
reference on electromyography consult Basmaijan and de Luca (1985). Recent reviews,
together with many references, on the advances in EMG modelling and analysis can be
found in the special issues of Medical Engineering and Physics (Vol. 22, issues 6 - 7,
1999) and Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology (Vol. 10, 2000).

The most common parameters used in the study of EMG is the integrated rectified EMG
(iEMG), the Random Mean Square value (RMS), the average frequency and the median
frequency. The two first parameters are defined for a given period T and EMG-signal m
as:

One can also trace the time evolution of the frequency parameters by dividing the EMG
times series into subintervals and calculate the spectrum for each subinterval and then use
Eqs (2 - 3). 

2.2.2 Modelling EMG

A MAP travelling along a fibre with a velocity v (taken to be aligned with the x-axis)
may be described by a "wave-function"

which describes the voltage amplitude of a travelling wave at the time t and the point x.
Thus, the signal h(t), recorded at a fixed point x0, as a function of time t is given by

If we have a train of MAPs arriving at times t1, t2, ..., tn we can write the signal at x0 as a
sum of pulses (MUAPT)

It is generally believed that the interpulse intervals (IPI) τi = ti (cid:150) ti-1 are generated by a
stochastic process. The average number of pulses λ per time is termed the firing rate. If
we take the Fourier transform of (3) we obtain

which apparently acts as a high-pass filter modulated with a frequency 1/τm. An example
of some physiologically realistic values could be τm = 60 ms and στ = 12 ms. Eq (10) is
in qualitative agreement with interpulse interval data (see Basmaijan and de Luca 1985 p.
78) and reaches a practically flat spectrum for f  > 2/τm (≈ 33 Hz in the present example).

The size of the first peak is sensitive to the size of the standard deviation (cid:31)(cid:31). Indeed,
), (cid:31)i = (cid:31)m (i = 1, 2,  ...), then (10)
suppose the interpulse intervals are constant ((cid:31)(cid:31) (cid:31)(cid:31) (cid:31)
will approach a sum of peaks at the points k/(cid:31)m. This follows from Poisson’s summation
formula (see e.g. Saichev and Woyczyæski 1997 p. 271) which in this context reads

(11)

where δ(x) is the Dirac delta function. On the other extreme side (uniform distribution),
if στ → ∞  then (10) approaches the constant function 1. 

In sEMG the electrodes will detect MUAPT from several muscle fibers and we have
therefore to consider a sum of MUAPTs (3)

(12)

Also the parameters characterising the interpulse intervals may change with time due e.g.
to fatigue. A general observation is that the conduction velocity v of the fibres decreases
with fatigue. The decrease in the conduction velocity is thought to be linked to the
decreasing pH-value in the fatiguing muscle. From Eq (3) we obtain that

(13)

∣h f ∣= 1

⋅∣g f

58/72

which suggests that the power spectrum is shifted toward the lower end when the velocity
v decreases. It is indeed observed that during fatigue (at constant force level) the median
and the average frequencies of the power spectrum tend to decrease. Indeed, if we
compute the average frequency of the spectrum (ignoring T(f) for the moment) we obtain

(14)

∫ f ∣h f ∣2 
∫∣h f ∣2 

df

df

∝ v

according to (13), which predicts a decrease of the average frequency due to decreasing
velocity v. This is because the "energy" (the denominator in (14)), the integrated power,
is proportional to 1/v and thus increases with decreasing velocity v. But it is also found
that
the firing rate λdecreases with fatigue, perhaps due to adaptation. The firing rate
affects the factor (7) since the number of pulse n is given by n = λt where t is the time
of measurement. Thus, averaging over the time t we get the factor λ and we would
therefore predict the energy to change as  λ/v. 

The combined observed effect is that the energy tends to increase with fatigue for sEMG,
but to decrease for EMG measured with indwelling electrodes. The explanation may be
that in the case of the sEMG the shift of the spectrum toward the lower end means that a
larger part of the energy will reside inside its bandpass interval, determined by the skin
and tissue and the distance between the electrodes, enough to offset the decrease due to
the lowered firing rate (see Basmaijan and de Luca 1985 p. 92 (cid:150) 94, and ch. 8 on muscle
fatigue). For indwelling electrodes the bandwidth is much larger and there is no similar
effect of a "shadowed energy coming into light".

It is common to measure sEMG using bipolar electrodes; that is, with two detecting
surfaces. Suppose the electrodes are aligned along the axis of the muscle fibres with a
separation d. The potential difference between the electrodes due to a travelling wave (1)
would be

and the cancellation frequencies given by

for n = 1, 2, 3, ... For bipolar surface electrodes we may have d = 0.01 m, which for v = 4
m/s gives a cancellation frequency (n = 1) of 400 Hz. For needle electrodes we may have
a separation around d = 5 ⋅ 10-4 m which gives a corresponding cancellation frequency of
8000 Hz. In careful measurements the dip in the spectrum around the cancellation fre-
quency v/d can be observed and used for determining the conduction velocity v.

An interesting observation is that there seems to be a kind of a natural background
oscillations of the muscles at constant-force contractions. 

"The fluctuations in force which are ever present during attempted constant-force
contractions are a manifestation of low frequency oscillations which are inherent in
the firing rates of the motor units. The dominant frequency of this oscillation is
approximately 1.5 Hz. The source of this oscillation has not been identified yet"
(Basmaijan and de Luca 1985 p. 152).  

Basmajian & de Luca notes later that this phenomenon may perhaps be related to another
property of the muscle. If the muscle is exercised with a sinusoidal varying force at
isometric conditions one may estimate the transfer function of the mechano-electric
system between the integrated rectified EMG and the force. One quoted approximate
result for the transfer function is (from Basmaijan and de Luca 1985, p. 197) which refers
to results by Soechting and Roberts 1975)

which thus acts as low pass filter with the cutoff frequency of 2.5 Hz which is of the
same order as the frequency of the "natural oscillation" of the muscle.

2.2.2.1 Model of IAP

A popular mathematical model for the intracellular action potential (IAP) is given as a
function of space co-ordinate by (see e.g. Stegeman et al. 2000)

(1)

IAP  x= A x3  e­ x⋅ x­B

60/72

with parameters A, B and λwhich can be chosen so that (1) fits the observed potentials.
(The Heviside function Θ(x) on the RHS makes the first term zero for x < 0.) From the
action potential (1) we may also derive the corresponding transmembrane current Im.
Indeed,  the classical cable equation

(see e.g. Keener & Sneyd 1998, ch. 8) for an intensive treatment, and for a more exten-
sive treatement, see (Koch 1999), a book which is largely devoted to the applications of
the cable equation to physiology) goes back to works by Lord Kelvin (1859) and Oliver
Heaviside (1876) on the theory of the transatlantic cable and was imported into
physiology foremost by Hodgkin and Rushton (1946). Though Eq (2) is a relatively
simple consequence of the basic "laws" of Ohm and Kirchoff in the theory of electricity it
has profound consequences. 

In the present context φ in Eq (2) is the potential difference across the membrane, Cm is
the capacitance per unit area of the membrane, Im is the total transmembrane current
densisty, IIon is the ohmic part of the transmembrane current density, σ is the electrical
conductivity along the fibre axis, and a is the radius of the fibre. Identitfying Im with
IAP above we obtain that Im is proportional to the second derivative of the IAP potential,

(3)

I m x=

⋅d 2  IAP  x

where a is the radius of the fibre and σ is the electrical conductivity along the fibre
axis (which here coincides with the x-axis). Since the extracellular space generally have
quite high conductivity the potential
is nearly constant on the outer side of the
membrane. It is therefore the current density (3) which carries the information about the
potential changes in the cell to the outside world. This is described in the next section on
the volume conductor model.

The cable equation (2) allows for pulse-like waves (action potentials) in the fibre as was
shown in the pioneering works by Hodgkin, Huxely and Katz (1954). By taking into
account the active ion pumps of the cell, the IIon will be described as a nonlinear function
of the potential. This in turn is the mathematical basis for the existence of the pulse-like
solutions. It may be fitting here to quote the words by Keener and Sneyd (p. 121) on the
Hodgkin-Huxley-Katz contribution: "In biology, where quantitatively predicitve theories
are rare, this works stands out as one of the most successful combinations of experiment
and theory". However, some of the basic tenets of the ion pump theory have been
challenged by G Ling (2001) and G H Pollack (2001) on both experimental and
theoretical grounds. 

2.2.2.2 The volume conductor model

Consider first the simple case of a homogenic resistive medium with the current density J
and the potential φ   related by the ohmic relation

(1)

­ ∇ =J

61/72

where  σ  is the conductivity (Eq (1) is essentially a continuum rendering of "Ohm’s law" 
U = RI ). Taking the divergence of Eq (1) and assuming  σ  to be constant we obtain

(2)

­ ∇ 2 =∇⋅J = I S

The last equality in Eq (2) defines the current source IS. In order to elucidate the meaning
of the current source term we integrate it over a volume V bounded by a surface S using
Gauss’ divergence theorem 

(3)

∫

∇⋅J dV =∫

J⋅d S

Suppose S is the surface bounding a muscle fibre, then the RHS of Eq (3) gives the
current flowing through the surface (the transmembrane current). Comparing Eqs (2) of
this and the previous sections we infer that for a cylindrical fiber of radius a we have

I S= 2

Muscle fibers are however not electrically isotropic. The conductivity along the axis of
the fibre is about five times the radial conductivity. Typical values are given in the table

The Eq (2) is simple to adapt to the case of the anisotropic muscle. In terms of cylindrical
co-ordinates the Poisson equation becomes (the fiber axis along the z-axis)

In one of the oldest models, described e.g. in Stegeman et al. (2000), one considers the
case of a fibre in the muscle. The muscle tissue is assumed to be a volume conductor of
infinite extent bounded by an infinite plane Γ, representing the skin, which is taken to be
parallel with the fibre axis. The boundary condition for (4) is then that no current passes
through the skin,

62/72

(5)

 r n⋅∇  = 0 
at the plane  

where n denotes the normal of the plane. Suppose that the plane Γ is at a distance d/2
from the fibre. Now it is easy to construct a solution for (4 - 5) from the solutions φ0
in
the case of an unrestricted infinite volume conductor using the mirroring method.
Indeed, if we add two such solutions, one with the fibre on the right side of the plane, the
other with the fiber on the mirror side of the plane,

(6)

r =0r 0r – d 

 

then it can be shown that it satisfies the boundary condition (5). Especially on the skin
(the plane Γ) we obtain

(7)

r =2 0r 
for   r ∈

These results are based on the fact that in the isotropic case φ0 is a simple sum or integral
of 1/| r |-potentials (which all satisfy Eq (2) in the region where Is = 0). The solution in
anisotropic case can be obtained from the isotropic solution by rescaling the z-variable as

⋅z  . This leads finally to the expression

for the potential at the skin due to a MAP in a fibre of length L and radius a. The next
step is to add more realistic details to the model by considering the fatty tissue and the
properties of the skin.

2.2.2.3 A four-layer model

We will describe a simple four-layer model (Farina & Rainoldi 1999) which gives an
idea how the tissue affects the current generated signal in the muscle. In this model we
have a sandwich consisting of a muscle layer (a), a fat layer (b), and finally a skin layer
(c) which interfaces with the air (d). The y-axis is taken to be orthogonal to the sections,
the x-axis is along the plane orthogonal to the direction of the muscle, whereas the z-axis
is taken to be along the muscle.

63/72

All the layers are supposed to be isotropic except for the muscle layer which has different
conductivities in the transversal (x-axis) and the axial directions (z-axis) as pointed out
int the previous section. 

The current source is supposed to be a unit point source located at (0, -y0, 0)

(1)

I m x , y , z = x y y0 z 

The solution for a general current source can then be obtained by summing solutions for
point sources. This is an example of the methods of the Green's function in mathematical
physics (Wallace 1984). If we have some linear differential equation

(2)

 r =r 

then a Green’s function G(r) is a solution of the point source equation

(3)

G r =r 

and the solution to (2) can then be obtained from

(4)

r =∫ G r­ss d s

In signal processing the transfer function (cid:150) the response H to a delta-signal input (cid:150) is the
counterpart of the Green’s function. Following Farina and Rainoldi (1999) we will study
the solution of (2) in term of the Fourier transformed field

(5)

k x , y , k z=∫∫ e­i k x x­i k z z  x , y , z  dx dz

64/72

The Eq (4) of the previous section then becomes in the present problem, with the unit
current source (1), the following set of equations (σax = σay ≠ σaz): 

for layer (a), and for the other layers (σx = σy = σz) we get similar equations

whose solutions are composed of simple exponential functions e±ky. while in the layer (a)
we have an "inhomogenic" solution of the type e-k|y + y0| plus the homogenic ones e±ky. The
boundary conditions are that the field, and the current density J (Eq (1) in the previous
section), should be continuous at the layer interfaces,

where "-" ("+") means the left (right) side limit value at a layer interface. Together with
the requirement that φ(y) goes to zero as y → ±∞, these equations and conditions
determine an unique solution. In fact, we have already used (8) in Eqs (6) and (7) for the
x and z directions when using the fact that kx and kz do not change going from one layer to
another for solutions having an x- and a z-dependence of the form
. The
general solution for each layer can be written

As pointed out by Farina and Rainoldi (1999) one can use this theoretical model to invert
the filtering of the tissue and thus even resolve individual MUAPs from the sEMG data.
These aspects will hopefully be developed further in the second part.

A faster than “World fastest derivation  
of the Lorentz transformation”

Macdonald1  considers  that  his  derivation  of  the  Lorentz-Einstein 
 
transformation  (LET)  is  the  fastest  one  in  the  world.  It  is  based  on  the 
assumptions: 
A. The speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames. 
B.  A  clock  moving  with  constant  speed V  in  an  inertial  reference  frame  K 
runs at a constant rate 
with respect to the synchronized clocks of K 
which it passes. 
Assumption B is a cryptic way of presenting the time dilation effect.  
 
on the formula that accounts for the length contraction effect 

The purpose of our note is to present a derivation of the (LET) based

where  L  and  L0    represent  the  length  of  the  same  rod  measured  by  an 
observer  relative  to  whom  the  rod  moves  with  constant  speed  V  in  its 
direction (L) and by an observer relative to whom it is at rest (proper length 
L0), respectively.  

The  scenario  we  follow2  involves  two  parallel  rods  1  and  2  with 
 
proper  lengths  L0,1  and  L0,2,  respectively.  (Figure  1)  Rod  1  is  at  rest  in  the 
K(OX)  frame  and  located  along  the  OX  axis  with  its  left  end  at  O.  Rod  2 
moves  with  constant  speed  V  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  OX  axis.  The 
clocks involved are 
 and 
located at the left and right end of rod 
1, respectively and 
located at the left and right end of rod 
 and 
, the left ends 
2, respectively. When clocks 
of the two rods are located at the same point in space. At that very moment, 
a source of light S(0) located at the left end of rod 1 and at rest relative to it 
emits  a  light  signal  (Figure  1a).  When  the  right  ends  of  the  two  rods  are 
located  at  the  same  point  in  space,  clock

The  length  of  rod  2  measured  by  observers  from  the  stationary  reference 
frame is in accordance with (1) 

If  the  length  of  a  rod  is  defined  as  a  difference  between  the  space 
coordinates of its ends, we have 

Figure  1b  displays  lengths  measured  by  observers  of  the  same  reference 
frame, and so we can add them, yielding the result  

Expressing  (6)  as  a  function  of  the  space-time  coordinates  defined  above, 
this equation becomes

We  have  derived  the  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations  for  the  space  time 
coordinates of the same event 
in K’ associated with 
the fact that the right ends of the two rods are located at the same point in 
space.  The  way  in  which  we  have  derived  these  transformations  clearly 
shows the conditions under which they hold and the part played by rods and 
clocks in the derivations.

If  we  measure  the  “length”  of  a  derivation  by  the  number  of 
 
assumptions made throughout, we can consider that our derivation makes the 
single length contraction assumption. 

By knowing the exact meaning of the physical quantities involved in 
 
the  LET,  we  can  use  them  to  derive  formulas  that  account  for  different 
relativistic  effects,  without  obscuring  the  physics  behind  them.  By 
considering  the  same  scenario  from  the  reference  frame  where  rod  2  is  at 
rest, we can derive the inverse LET.

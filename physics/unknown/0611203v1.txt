A little error was eliminated from Hertz’s equations. New Hertz’s equations don’t contradict to 
all electromagnetic experiments. Therefore Hertz’s electrodynamics is the alternative to Einstein’s 
electrodynamics. It means that the question about the absolute or relative character of both space and  
time must be rediscussed. Lorentz’s transformations can be used only if our theoretical model of 
an electromagnetic phenomenon is not complete one . 

 
 
Hertz’s equations. 

During more than 110 years the Hertz’s equations for the electrodynamics of a moving 

bodies [1] are referred in scientific literature as an example of an unsuccessful attempt to create 
the electrodynamics of a moving bodies in absolute time and in absolute space. The careful 
analysis of the critical works ([2 – 4], for example) shows us that the authors right found an error 
in Hertz’s equations. But they didn’t try to eliminate the error from the equations. Meanwhile it 
is very simple error. The error consists in equality of both charge velocity and ether velocity 
(“full ether drugging” by any charges). The error leads to contradictions of Hertz’s equations 
with a number of electromagnetic experiments (for example, Roentgen W., Eichenwald A., Wil-
son H. experiments, see below).  

At the recent time we should not be frightened the idea of an ether. This idea is a basis of 

contemporary physics. Still Einstein spoke that the physics needs in an ether. But it must be, of 
course, not mechanical ether. In the work I want to show that the Hertz’s equations without the 
error can be very flexible for the explanation of all electromagnetic experiments. We must to re-
place only one letter in the Hertz’s equations. 

Hertz died 37 years old, only a few years after publication of he’s equations [1]. It is very 
probably that Hertz could correct the little error in he’s equations if he’s life would be more long.  

So, the original Hertz’s equations are [1-4]:

Here R(t) is the vector from zero point of frame S to zero point of frame S1. It depends only 
from t. Then velocities in the reference frames are linked so: 
 
 
 
Let some vector has an image f(r,t) in S. Then it has image f*(r1,t) = f(r (r1 +  R(t)),t) in S1. 
Then partial derivatives will linked in such manner:

To eliminate the transition velocity V(t) from the equations in frame S1 we must to add 

the additional terms to equations (13) and (14) : 

 

 rot[D x  w1]  and   - rot[B x  w2] 

(21) 

 
Here w1 and w2 are some arbitrary velocities. The terms (21) give us in S1 the same terms with 
the transition velocity V(t)  as in (17) – (18) but with another signs. Then all terms with the tran-
sition velocity V(t) will be eliminated from (17) – (18). We will consider now that 
 

 w1 = w2 = v    

 

 

(22) 

 

 

 
is the ether velocity. 

 Then equations (13) – (16) with the additional terms (21) will have the same form as the 

Hertz’s equations (5) – (8). Therefore the Hertz’s equations (5) – (8) are invariant equations. 

Moreover the Hertz’s equations (5) – (8) are invariant equations not only with respect to 
Galilean’s transformations but also with respect to arbitrary movement of the reference frames. 
The “freedom” of the ether velocity v in Hertz’s equations (5) – (8) means the necessity 

to built an additional theory for the ether. Such theory for the mechanical ether tried to built 
Stocs, for example. We do not know the physical nature of the ether. But for the Hertz’s equa-
tions we need of only the velocity v of the ether in our laboratory frame. It is well known that all 
electromagnetic experiments (excluding Fizeau’s experiment, see below) can be explained if the 
ether is motionless both in the Space (in the frame of “ motionless stars”) (“Lorentz’s ether”) and 
near the surface of big massive cosmic bodies (planets, stars) (in the frame which motionless 
with respect to the center of mass of the bodies). Near the cosmic body the ether don’t rotate 
with the body. It’s movement is only progressive movement with the center mass of the body. 
We don’t need to know the ether velocity in the transition layer between the Space and the body, 
because we haven’t any precision experiments in the layers. 

In the picture of an ether I must to do special remark about the famous Fizeau’s experi-
ment (measurement of light velocity in a moving water). Theoretical explanation of the experi-
ment was done by Fresnel as a case of “partial ether dragging” by moving charged bodies. But 
below I will show that it is simpler to explain the experiment with the help of “mean velocity” of 
light in dielectric medium. Therefore Fizeau’s experiment hasn’t any relation to the ether theory. 

So we have v = 0 in the Hertz’s equations (5) – (8) for all experiments in which we can 

consider that our earth laboratory frame is motionless with respect to the center mass of the 
Earth. Also v = 0 far from the Earth in the frame of “motionless stars”. If our laboratory frame is 
moving with the velocity w with respect to any of these frames than v = - w in the Hertz’s equa-
tions. We can experimentally discover the movement of our laboratory frame with respect to the 
Earth ether (see, for example, Sagnac experiment, Michelson experiment [2-4]). 

Electromagnetic relativity principle in the Hertz’s theory means that electromagnetic 

process will be the same in the reference frames in which movements of a charges and the ether 
are the same.  
 
Invariant nature of the fields. 
 
Invariant nature of the electromagnetic fields in Hertz’s theory means that all field vec-
tors don’t change their both values and directions in different reference frames. It not coincides 
with special relativity theory (SRT). But as the result we have more simple language in Hertz’s 
theory than in SRT one. 
 
the earth laboratory frame of point charge Q along of moving charged filament. Second example 
is the movement in vacuum in the earth laboratory frame of a contour with current J along of the 
same moving charged filament. Let all velocities are constants and have very small values. 

Let us consider here two simple examples. First example is the movement in vacuum in 

 

 

 

(23) 

F = Q( E + [(u - v) x B] ) 

First of all in Hertz’s theory we must to determine the invariant Lorentz’s force: 

 
 
 
 
Here: u – velocity of charge Q; v – velocity of the ether. 
The force (23) is invariant because it depends only from the relative velocity. Q and field vectors 
are invariants. Note here that force (23) can to do the mechanical work not only in electrical field 
but also in magnetic field in common case. The force (23) can be modified by multiplication on 
(1 – ((u-v)/c)2)1/2 to take into consideration an experimental results in the case of big velocities. 
But here we don’t need in the modification. 
 
examples don’t depend from t. Therefore the equations (5) – (8) will be now in the form: 
 
 

We will to consider that velocity of the ether v = 0 in our Earth laboratory frame S. Our 

rot(B) = µ0qu   
 
rot(E) = 0 
 
div(B) = 0 
ε0div(E) = q 
 

 
 
 
 

(24) 
(25) 
(26) 
(26) 

F = Q( E + [u x B] )   

 
Here: q – density of charge on the filament; u – velocity of the filament. 
We see that magnetic field in the frame S is created by the convectional current qu. On the 
charge Q with velocity u acts the force: 
 
 
 
In the frame S the languages of both Hertz and SRT are the same: on the charge Q acts electric 
and magnetic fields. 
 
charge Q is u= 0 and the ether velocity is v = - u . Then in equations (5) – (8) we can to elimi-
nate the term qu. But the terms with the ether velocity give us: 
 

Now let the frame S1 is connected with moving charge Q. In the frame S1 velocity of the 

(27) 

-rot [-u x E] = (E∇)u – (u∇)E + udiv(E) – Ediv(u) = q u   
 -rot [-u x B] = (B∇)u – (u∇)B + udiv(B) – Ddiv(u) = 0 
 

(28) 
(29) 

 
Here we take into account that velocity u don’t depend from coordinate and the field gradients 
have the direction to the filament, i.e. they are perpendicular to the u .  

Therefore in the frame S1 the equations (24) – (26) and the force (27) will be the same as 
in S. But conventional current  in S1 is due to the ether movement! Therefore Hertz tells us that 
convectional current is due to the relative movements of charges and ether! I.e. convectional cur-
rent don’t depend from reference frame. 

 Further, in S1 the Hertz’s language is different from SRT language. Namely, according 
to Hertz on the charge Q in S1 acts the same electric and magnetic field as they are in S. Accord-
ing to SRT on the charge Q in S1 acts only electric field, which is equal to the sum of the terms 
in round brackets in (27). I.e. Hertz tells us that magnetic field can act on a motionless charge if 
it is streamlined by the ether! 

 

Now let us consider the movement of the small electroneutral contour with the current J 

along the same moving charged filament. It is very interesting example. The fields in the area of 
the contour we will consider as homogeneous because small radius of the contour. In the frame S  
the contour is motionless and there are turning couple of Amper’s forces F on opposite sides of 
the contour as shown on the picture 1. The Amper’s forces will turn the contour until both  the 
filament and the contour will lie in the same plane. The Amper’s forces let us to measure the 
field B in the area of the contour. Therefore in the frame S the contour is the device for the mag-
netic field measuring.  

In Hertz’s theory the movement of the electroneutral contour with arbitrary velocity 
along the filament don’t influences on the couple of Amper’s forces because additional Lorentz’s 
forces on both positive and negative charges eliminate one another. I.e. the moving contour will 
measure the same magnetic field as the motionless contour! It is logically right because other-
wise the velocity of the measuring device must be included in a magnetic field determination and 
in the Maxwell’s equations.  

Let now the frame S1 is connected with the contour and contour velocity is u in S . Then 
in S1 both the contour and the filament are motionless but contour is turning! It is because in S1 
the ether is moving and magnetic field is the same as in S! I.e. we can to determine in S1 our 
movement with respect to the ether with the help of such experimental devices for the magnetic 
field measuring. 

The SRT gives us, of course, the same turning of the contour in the example. But the lan-
guage of the SRT is more difficult then it is in Hertz’s theory. Consider it. All forces will be in-
variant because small velocities in the example. Let E and B are the fields in the frame S where 
contour is motionless. Let now the contour is moving in S with the velocity u . Then positive 
ions in the contour will have velocity u. The electrons will have velocities (u+w) and (u-w) on 
the opposite sides of the contour. Here w is electron velocity with respect to the contour. Accord-
ing to the SRT we must to find electrostatic Coulomb’s forces, which act in the frames where the 
charges are motionless. Take into consideration only the linear field transformations (because of 
small velocities) we will find electric fields and Coulomb’s forces, which act on the both positive 
and negative charges on opposite sides of the contour: 

 
F1 = QE1
F2 = - QE2
F3 = - QE3
 

* = Q(E + [u x B])   

 
* = - Q(E + [(u+w) x B])   
* = - Q(E + [(u-w) x B])   

(30) 
(31) 
(32) 

Now we can to find resulting Coulomb’s forces on the opposite sides of the contour: 
 

F*

1 = F1 + F2 =  - Q( [w x B])  

(33) 

F*

2 = F1 + F3 =  - Q( [-w x B]) 

(34) 

 
It is the same couple of forces as Amper’s forces in the frame S! I.e. the SRT in case of small 
velocities gives us the same turning of the contour as it is in Hertz’s theory. But the language of 
the SRT in that case is bad because the same device is measuring both magnetic field in frame S 
and electric field in frame S1! It is not very nice. The Hertz’s explanation of the example is free 
from such difficulties. 

Experiments of Rowland H., Roentgen W., Eichenwald A., Wilson H.. 
 
The most rigorous criticism of the original Hertz’s equations (1) – (4) was excited by 
their contradiction to these experiments with rotating disk capacitor [2-4]. But the equations (5) –

To consider these experiments we will change the rotating disk capacitor with dielectric

E = ( Ef + Ec ) – resulting electric field in the dielectric. 

 
 
 
 
examples don’t depend from t. Therefore the equations (5) – (8) will be now in the form: 
 
 

We will to consider that velocity of the ether v = 0 in our earth laboratory frame . Our

div(B) = 0 
ε0div(E) = ρf + ρc

(38) 

 
Here all volume charge densities ρ = 0 in the volumes but ρ = ∞ on the boundaries. The surface 
densities of the charges we will mark as σ.  
 
magnetic fields are in factor 2 greater, of course). From (35) and (38) we obtain follow boundary 
conditions: 
 
 

We will consider the fields only near one bounder S1, for example (the full measured 

2B =  µ0 ⎢σfuf - σcuc⎢  
ε0E = σf - σc ,  here: ε0Ef = σf  , ε0Ec = σc 

 

 

 
 

(39) 
(40) 

Now we must to postulate the usual  “matter” equation. We write it as the equation for 

 
 
the Lorentz’s forces, which act inside the dielectric on bound charges: 
 
Ff  = ε F  = ε (Ff + Fc + Fext) = ε {(Ef + Ec + Eext) + [ ucx Bf ] + [ uc x Bc ] + [ ucx Bext ] }    (41) 

 

 

Here: ε -  permittivity of the dielectric; “ext” – external fields. 
From (41) we can find: 
 

Ec = (1- ε)( E + [uc x B])  or 
Ec = { ((1- ε)/ε)( Ef + Eext + [uc x Bf ] + [ ucx Bext ])  -  [uc x Bc ]  } 

 

     (42) 

 
Note that external magnetic field exists only in Wilson’s experiment (see case d) below). In other 
cases we haven’t any external fields. Let the dielectric is not magnetic. Then we can eliminate 
the terms with Bf, Bc from (41),(42) because they are very small. 
 

Now we can to explain all the experiments: 

a)  only metallic disk is moving with uf  . Then we have measured magnetic field : 

B = 0.5µ0σfuf = 0.5µ0ε0Efuf = 0.5µ0ε0εEuf    
 
It was confirmed by the experiment. 

b)  only dielectric is moving with uc . Then we have measured magnetic field:

In the usual criticism Hertz’s equations (1) – (4) contradict to the Fresnel’s formula (47),

In quantum mechanics the process of light movement in a matter is a sequence of  an ab-

sorptions and reemissions of  a light quantum by molecules or atoms of the matter. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(48) 

T = τ  +  t 

V = (L – UT) / T = L / T - U   

Let L is the mean free path of the light quantum between two molecules or two atoms of a matter 
and τ is the mean time of life of the molecule or atom in the excited state. During the time τ the 
light quantum is moving together with the atom with the matter velocity. Let U = W – v is the 
matter velocity with respect to the ether. In our earth laboratory frame the ether velocity v = 0. 
Let the matter is moving to the light source. Than the mean velocity of the light quantum is : 
 
 
 
Here T is the full time of the movement of the quantum between two atoms : 
 
 
 
and t is time of free path of the quantum. We can find t from : 
 
 
i.e.: 
 
 
Then : 
 
 
Then we have from (48) and (51) mean velocity of the quantum: 
 
 
or : 
 
 
Let as usually  k <<1. Than Tailor’s expansion of the (52) until the first order in k is: 
 

V = [L/C –  τ (1+k)k] / [τ (1+k)/C +L/C2 ] ; k = U/C  

V = L / [τ  +  L / (C + U)] –  U  

T = τ  +  L / (C + U)   

            t = L / (C + U) 

tC + tU = L

V = C/(1+τ C/L) – [1 – 1/(1+τ C/L)2]U 

 
 
The formula (53) is the Fresnel’s formula (47) if we determine n as: 

 

(53) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (54) 

n = (1 + τ C/L) 

 
 
 
 
The Hertz’s equations (5) – (8) don’t contain ether velocity for the experiment (v=0), be-
cause laboratory system is motionless with respect to the center mass of the Earth. Therefore the 
Hertz’s equations is the same as Maxwell’s equations for the motionless matter. The equations 
give us the electromagnetic wave velocity C/n in the matter. Therefore we can to get right veloc-
ity (47) for the moving matter by two ways. On the first way we must to do some additional arti-
ficial transformation of both time and space intervals to do continuous wave velocity equal to the 
mean quantum velocity (47). The way is realized in Lorentz’s transformations. On the second 
way we must to include the matter velocity U in the “matter” equation. I will not to do that for a 
common case. But for our example we can simply to determine the new refraction coefficient n*: 
 

 

C/n – [1 – 1/n2]U  =  C / n* 

 

 

                    

Then: 

n* = n {C / [C – (1 – 1/n2)Un] } 

 
 
Now we will briefly mention here a few other important experiments because their expla-

 
 
nations are very simple on the base of the Hertz’s equations (5) – (8).

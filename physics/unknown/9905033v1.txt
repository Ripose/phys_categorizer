Abstract
There  are  applications,  which  require  MeV-range
multiple-beams consisting of a large number of  identical
highly  packed  beamlets.  The  multiple-beam  RFQ  (MB-
RFQ)  arranged  as  a  matrix  array  of  longitudinal  rod-
electrodes  is  appropriate  candidate.  A  configuration  of
MB-RFQ  resonator  should  ensure  identical  quadrupole
fields in every accelerating channel.
resonators 

on  TEM
transmission 
lines  are  studied.  The  resonators  are
designed  by  a  periodical  multiplication  of  a  4-rod  unit
cell  in  transverse  direction.  To  understand  fields  of
resonator  the  normal  mode  technique  is  applied.  Novel
configurations  of  MB-RFQ  resonators  based  on  these
normal  modes  are  generated.  The  RF  properties  of
resonators  are  verified  with  computer  simulations  done
with MAFIA code.

The  MB-RFQ 

based 

Beam  dynamics  study  for  the  initial  400-keV  MB-
RFQ  has  been  performed  using  PARMTEQ  code.  The
MB-RFQ  parameters  and  the  results  of  beam  dynamics
simulations  are  presented.  The  calculated  beam
transmission  is  33%  at  injection  of  50-keV,  20mA
deuteron beam.

I. ITRODUCTION

In  recent  years,  many  ion  sources  with  a  broad-
beams  have  been  developed  [1-5].  The  broad-beams  are
formed  as  multiple-beams  consisting  of  an  array  of
identical  single-beams  (or  beamlets).  The  beamlets  are
packed very closely. The packing factor defined as a ratio
between  the  sum  of  areas  occupied  by  beamlets  and  a
total area of broad-beam can reach 40-50 %. The number
of  beamlets  may  achieve  several  hundreds  (or  even
thousands).  Transverse  size  of  broad-beam  can  be  up  to
one meter or more.

There  are  applications,  which  require  MeV-range
broad-beams,  e.g.  heating  of  plasmas 
in  magnetic
confinement devices  [3-5].  The  typical required  ion  flux
is  20-30  mA/cm2  over  a  total  surface  of  about  200cm2.
Existing  broad-beam  accelerators  use  the  electrostatic
method  of  acceleration.  Because  of  technical  problems
due to the voltage breakdown, an attainable level of beam
energy  is  restricted.  Up  to  now,  a  D-  current  of  1A
(20mA/cm2) 50 keV energy was obtained [5].

Perhaps,  some  RF-acceleration method adapted to  a
multiple-beam  acceleration  may  be  applied  for  MeV-
range  broad-beam  accelerators.  Many  RF  multiple-beam
accelerating structures had been already  presented in  the
past years [6-15].

MB-RFQ  arranged  as  an  array  of  longitudinal  rod-
electrodes (see Fig. 1) is known for a long time [6,9,11].
It  is  required  to  realize  a  high  packing  factor  without
disturbing  RFQ  fields  and  excite  correctly  electrodes
surrounding  every  channel.  In  this  paper,  we  try  to  find
out  possible  configurations  of  the  MB-RFQ  structures
satisfying the above requirements.

MB-RFQ  structures  are 

the  TEM
transmission  line  resonator.  The  resonators  are  designed
by  a  periodical  multiplication  of  a  4-rod  unit  cell  in
transverse  direction.  The  normal  mode  technique  is
applied  to  decompose  a  complicated  field  resonator  into
fields of normal modes.

The  resonator  field  is  expanded  into  normal  modes
having simple field patterns. In general case of resonator
with  an  arbitrary  number  of  rods  and  normal  modes,
analysis  becomes  difficult.  To  simplify  problem,  only
normal modes composed from four normal modes of a 4-
rod unit cell are selected. Similar to normal modes of a 4-
rod unit cell (coaxial, quadrupole and two dipole modes),
selected normal modes of multi-rod resonator have  clear
field patterns.

II. NORMAL MODES OF THE NCSTL.

Let  us  consider  MB-RFQ 

resonator  with  N
longitudinal  electrodes  as  a  resonator  based  on  the  N-
conductor  shielded  TEM  transmission  lines  (NCSTL).
The  propagation  of  TEM  waves  is  described  by  the
system  of  the  telegraph  equations.  To  facilitate  solution
of  the  telegraph  equation  the  normal  mode  technique  is
usually  applied.  The  resonator  field  is  expanded  into
normal  modes  having  simple  field  patterns.  In  the
transmission  line  with  N-conductors, there  are  N  normal
TEM modes.

4>N

This technique has been applied to study 4-rod RFQ
using  the  four-conductor  shielded  transmission  line
,  the  analytical
(4CSTL)  [16-18].  In  the  case  of 
definition  of  normal  modes  becomes  difficult.  To
facilitate the study, let us restrict a number of considered
normal modes in the NCSTL. A 4-rod configuration with
known normal modes is considered as a unit cell. Normal
modes  of  the  NCSTL  are  composed  by  a  periodical
multiplication of a 4-rod unit cell in transverse direction.
The normal modes in the 4CSTL can be observed in
the  resonator  shown  in  Fig.2.  All  four  electrodes  are
grounded at the same longitudinal position, z=0 and have
open ends at the another end of resonator, z=l.

III. SINGLE-MODULE RESONATORS
BASED ON A CONVENTIONAL RFQ.

The  quadrupole  mode  of  the  type  1  has  correct-
balanced quadrupole potentials for all channels. The field
of  the  quadrupole  mode  increases  sinusoidally  along  z-
direction.  Being  excited  on  this  quadrupole  mode,  the
MB-resonator  shown  in  Fig.  4  can  be  used  as  an  initial
matching section.

Figure 6 shows the MB resonator designed using an
extension  of  4-rod  RFQ  in  the  transverse  direction.  All
electrodes  are  divided  into  two  groups  in  a  chess  order.
The  electrodes  of  two  groups  are  grounded  in  opposite
manner. Similar structures based on this design principle

is  described  by
combination of quadrupole and coaxial mode, which has
been presented in [17,18]. In contrast to 4-rod resonator,
the  coaxial mode  of  MB-RFQ  (see  Fig.5,  Coaxial  mode
of type 1) has unequal potentials of electrodes. Therefore,
the  combination  of  quarupole  with  this  coaxial  mode  in
the  MB  resonator  does  not  provide  correct  voltages  on
the  electrodes  surrounding  RFQ-channels.  It  is  difficult
to adapt this type of resonator to MB-RFQ-acceleration.

The  well-balanced  fields  can  be  provided  in  the
different  MB  resonator.  It  is  shown  in  Fig.  7.  This  MB
resonator  designed  using  a  periodical  multiplication  of
the 4-rod unit cell in the transverse direction. The field of
the  4-rod  unit  cell  of  the  resonator  is  described  by
combination  of  the  quadrupole  mode  and  the  normal
mode  shown  in  the  second  row  of  the  first  column  of
Fig.5.  Since  composing  modes  have  well-balanced
amplitudes, the total voltages  on  electrodes  are  balanced
well  and  every  second  RFQ-channel  can  be  used  for  an
acceleration of beamlets.

IV. PROBLEMS OF MULTI-MODULE
RESONATORS

in 

Considered 

the  previous  section  MB-RFQ
structures consist of a single module. In a single-module
resonator, one end of electrodes is either connected to or
cut at a tank bottom. To realize a multi-module structure,

electrodes should continuously spread along of total tank.
The  support  of  electrodes  is  provided  by  transverse
stems.  It  was  also  proposed  in  works  [9,12]  to  use  a
coupling elements to equalize potentials of electrodes.

In  conventional  RFQ  structure,  adjacent  electrodes
have different potentials along the whole structure.  They
can  not  be  interconnected  by  short-circuited  couplers.
Only next adjacent electrodes may be  interconnected  "in
a chess order". This circumference affects on a maximum
value  of  the  packing  factor,  which  can  be  achieved  in  a
realistic design.

Two  possible  configurations  of  couplers  consisting
of  ideal  thin  conductors are  shown  in  Fig. 8.  In  the  first
(left)  configuration,  coupling  conductors  bypass  the
RFQ-channels.  Only  a  quarter  of  RFQ-channels  is  used.
The  second  (right)  configuration  allows  the  penetration
of  the  coupling  elements  inside  RFQ-channels.  The
couplers have aperture-holes. The original RFQ-fields are
distorted in this configuration.

Figure  8:  Two  possible  configurations  of  coupling
elements.

In  order  to  prevent  voltage  breakdown,  the  realistic
configurations  should  be  composed  of  thick  conductors.
The  curvature  radii  of  all  conductors  could  not  be  less
than the curvature of RFQ-electrodes. We tried to design
such couplers. However, the packing factor is reduced to
5%  and  10%  for  the  left  and  right  configurations,
respectively.  These  low  values  of  the  packing  factor  do
not suit to values of existing MB ion sources.

V. MB-RFQ BASED ON A NEW 4-ROD RFQ

Let us find out a type of a resonator, which allows a
short-circuited  connections  between  adjacent  electrodes.
It may  to  be  helpful  to avoid  a reduction  of  the  packing
factor in multi-module structures with transverse stems.

Conventional  4-rod  RFQ  structures  based  on
quadrupole mode only or on a combination of quadrupole
and  coaxial  modes,  and  dipole  modes  are  usually
considered  as  unwanted  distortions,  which  must  be
suppressed.  Let  us  consider  an  unusual  combination  of
normal  modes  including  a  dipole  mode  [20].  This  is  a
superposition  of  quadrupole  mode  and  dipole  mode,
which  are  summed  at  a  l /4  phase  shift  between  each
other.  Figure  9  shows  the  voltage  distributions  for  this
combination of quadrupole and dipole modes in the case
of  the  4-rod  unit  cell.  The  result  of  the  summation  is
given on the right side of the Fig. 9.

Figure 10 shows pole tips at the ends and the middle
of  the  resonator.  The  length  of  the  unit  module  of  the
resonator, l is about a quarter of the wavelength, l . Apart
from  conventional  modulation  of  RFQ  electrodes  with
period length, l RFQ=2bl
, the pole tips are modulated with
the period length, L RFQ=2l. The RFQ-channel has  a zero
optical transparency, and can not provide  a  conventional
RFQ acceleration on z-axis. The beam dynamics must be
modified in this case.

in 

We  have  revealed  a  possible  way  to  provide  RFQ
acceleration in this accelerating  channel [20].  It is  based
on the fact that parts of beam coherently oscillate around
the  axis  during  transverse  oscillations  in  a  strong-
focusing  quadrupole  channel.  Figure  12  shows  particle
motion 
transverse  plane,  X0Y  calculated  by
PARMTEQ  code  [22]  for  a  conventional  RFQ.  Part  of
beam  injected  in  the  first  quadrant  of  the  X0Y-plane
performs  periodical  excursions  between  the  first  and  the
third  quadrants  of  X0Y-plane. This  part  of  the  beam  can
be  transported  in  the  accelerating  channel  of  the  new
resonator,  if  the  space  period  of 
transverse  beam
oscillations is matched to period of electrode modulation
L RFQ.

In  accelerating  channel  of  the  new  resonator,  the
beam  with  the  velocity,  v=b c  should  be  injected  with  a
shift  from  the  RFQ  axis.  The  beam  will  oscillate
coherently around the quadrupole axis with the frequency
of betatron oscillations,  W R. When the wavelength of the
betatron  oscillations,  L R=2p b cW R  is  matched  to  the
period 
i.e.
L R=L RFQ/(2n+1),  the  beam  bends  round  the  pole  tips

condition,  the  smooth  frequency  of  betatron  oscillation,

Figure  13:  MB-RFQ  resonator  with  4x4-matrix  array  of
electrodes.

For  the  case  of  MB-RFQ,  the  mode  combination
shown  for  4-rod  unit  cell  (Fig.9)  is  extended  to  the
superposition  of  quadrupole  mode  of  type  1  and  dipole
mode  of  type  2  (see  Fig.5).  For  a  real  configuration  of
MB-RFQ  resonator,  the  boundary  conditions  on  all  tank
walls must correspond to a perfect conductor. The dipole
mode of type 2 is replaced by the dipole mode of type 1.
In  contrast  to  the  dipole  mode  of  type  2,  potentials  of
electrodes  surrounding  RFQ-channels  for  the  dipole
mode  of  type  1  deviate  from  a  correct  dipole  field  (see
Fig.5). As the result, a total  field  in the  MB-resonator  is
distorted.

A  difference  between  dipole  modes  of  type  1  and
type  2  is  appeared  as  different  boundary  conditions  on
the  shield  for  the  upper  and  lower  rows  of  4-rod  unit
cells.  Free  frequencies  of  the  outer  cells  deviate  from
their values for cells in the middle rows of MB-resonator.
The free frequencies of the outer cells should be tuned.

The free frequency of a 4-rod unit cell depends on an
electrical  length  of  conductors.  The  tuning  method  has
been found. The length of conductors in the middle rows
should be less than the length in the outer  cells  on  some
value, d (see Fig.13).

The optimal value of d=1.8cm has been determined.
In  the  optimal  case,  curves  of  quadrupole  voltages
became very similar and the required phase shift of l /4 is
restored.  Thus,  RF  fields  in  different  channels  of  MB-
RFQ  structure  can  be  equalized  to  provide  identical  RF
fields in every RFQ-channel.

VII. Study Beam dynamics in MB-RFQ [24].

7.1 400-keV MB-RFQ

In order to evaluate an achievable beam transmission
and current for the MB-RFQ, beam dynamics simulations
has  been  performed  for  a  single  channel  of  MB-RFQ
linac, which accelerates ions of deuterons from 50 keV to
400 keV at RF frequency 108 MHz.
The  400-keV  MB-RFQ 

two
different RFQ structures. The first MB-RFQ is a structure
with  a  conventional  RFQ  acceleration  and  focusing  in  a
quarter-wave  resonator  with  an  increasing  RFQ  voltage.
The second structure is a two-module MB-RFQ resonator
for a “slalom”-beam.

linac  consists  of 

The configurations of these structures for 4x4-matrix
arrays  of  electrodes  were  shown  in  Fig.4  and  Fig.13,
respectively.  The  Fig.  15  shows  the  cross-sections  of  a

7.2 Numerical code for simulation beam dynamics.

As  it  has  been  discussed  in  the  section  5,  the
acceleration  in  the  MB  "slalom"-  beam  structure  has
several basic features in comparison with a  conventional
RFQ:

a  double-periodical  modulation  of  RFQ  electrodes

with period lengths, l RFQ, and L RFQ;

the  period  of  the  betatron  oscillations  must  be

matched to the period length L RFQ;

the  modulation  coefficient,  m  must  be  periodically
put  be  equal  to  zero  with  the  period  l  along  the  RFQ
channel;

the voltage  distributions  are  essentially  non-uniform

along RFQ-channel.

Due to these differences a conventional methods and
codes  for  design  RFQ  channels  like  PARMTEQ-code
[22]  could not  be  used  directly.  For  calculation  of  beam
dynamics  in  the  MB-RFQ  structures,  a  complementary
numerical code has been written using the Digital Visual
FORTRAN by Digital Co.

This code works interactively and allows introduce a
desirable  dependencies  of  RFQ  parameters  (voltage

7.3 Results of beam dynamics simulations.

The calculated parameters of MB-RFQ are presented
in Fig. 16. The first resonator performs a radial matching,
bunching  and  pre-acceleration  of  beam  from  50keV  to
114 keV. The length of the resonator, l is equal to about a
quarter of the wavelength l , i.e. l=0.7 m at the frequency
f0=108  MHz.  The  “slalom”-beam  RFQ  accelerates  a
bunched  beam  at  an  almost  constant  synchronous  phase
up  to  400  keV.  The  “slalom”-beam  RFQ  section  was
designed using the condition (3).

The  first  section  has  been  designed  to  accept  a
continuous  monochromatic  beam  with  the  transverse
is
emittance

bunched within a short length of structure (
) with
a fast increase of the synchronous phase (see Fig.16). For

66% for a zero-current beam. At the beam current 15 mA
and 30 mA the  beam  transmissions  become  to  63%  and
53%,  respectively.  Figure  18  shows  the  example  of  the
beam motion and the electrode profiles in the X0Z-plane.
Similar  situation  occurs  for  X0Y-plane.  Beam  performs
"slalom" motions, avoiding pole tips.

Finally,  common  transmission  of  two  structures  has
been  calculated.  The  transmission  of  42%  for  a  zero-
current  beam  reduces  to  33%  at  the  beam  current  of  20
mA,  respectively.  Figure  19  shows  the  phase  spaces  of
the output beam for the latter case.

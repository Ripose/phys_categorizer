Abstract:  The  nonlinear  features  of  the  relationships  between  particulate  matter  (PM)  and  volatile
organic  compounds  (VOC)  and  oxides  of  nitrogen  (NOx)  are  derived  directly  from  data  of  long-
term routine measurements of  NOx,  VOC,  and  total  suspended  PM.  The  main  idea  of  the  method
used for the analysis is  creation  of  special empirical models based on artificial neural networks of
the perceptron type. These models which are in essence the nonlinear extension of commonly used
linear  regression  models  are  believed  to  provide  the  best  fit  for  the  real  nonlinear  PM-NOx-VOC
relationships under different observed levels of air pollution and various meteorological conditions.
It is believed that such models may be useful in context of various scientific and practical problems
concerning PM. The method is demonstrated by the example of two empirical models created with
independent  data-sets  collected  at  two  air  quality  monitoring  stations  at  South  Coast  Air  Basin,
California. It is shown that in spite of considerable distance between the monitoring stations (more
than  50  km)  and  thus  substantially  different  environmental  conditions,  the  empirical  models
manifest  several  common  qualitative  features.  Specifically,  it  is  found  that,  under  definite
conditions, the decrease of the level of NOx or VOC may lead to the increase of mass concentration
of  PM.  It  is  argued  that  these  features  are  caused  by  the  non- linearities  in  the  dependence  of
hydroxyl radical on VOC and NOx.

1. Introduction

Air-borne  particulate  matter  (PM)  is  an  important  environmental  factor  having  impact  on
human  health,  affecting  visibility,  and  playing  a  significant  role  in  atmospheric  chemistry  and
climate.  The  level  of  PM  is  regulated  by  national  air  quality  standards,  implementation  of  which
requires a reliable scientific assessment of possible strategies for its reduction. Such an assessment,
however, represents an extremely difficult problem, because evolution of PM is driven by complex
physical and chemical processes which, in turn, are influenced by number of various environmental
factors.

In  particular,  significant  components  of  PM  such  as  sulfate,  nitrate,  and  organic  compounds
may  reach  particulate  phase  as  a  result  of  photochemical  processes  involving  certain  gaseous
species  (PM  precursors)  such  as  NOx,  SO2,  NH3,  and  volatile  organic  compounds  (VOC)  (e.g.,
Senfeld and  Pandis,  1998).  Specifically,  the  important  potential  source  of  PM  is  formation  of
sulfuric  acid  in  a  gas-phase  chain  mechanism  which  can  be  represented  by  the  combined  reaction
(Stockwell et al., 1990)
                                                SO2+OH+(+M, O2, H2O)ﬁ H2SO4+HO2.                                          (1)
Another  potential  source  (see,  e.g.,  Meng  et  al.,  1997  and  references  therein)  of  the  particulate
material is the reversible reaction of ammonia with nitric acid
                                                        NH3(g)+HNO3(g)« NH4NO3(p),                                               (2)
where (g) and (p) denote gas and particulate phases, respectively. The HNO3,  in  turn,  is  formed  in
the gas-phase reaction
                                                                   OH+NO2ﬁ HNO3.                                                          (3)

Condensable compounds may be also formed in reactions of certain  VOCs  with  OH,  O3,  or  NO3
(Odum et al., 1996; 1997).

It  is  obvious  from  the  aforesaid  that  formation  of  PM  is  driven  to  a  significant  extent  by  the
hydroxyl  radical  (OH),  the  behavior  of  which  is  known  to  be  determined  by  large  number  of
chemical processes (see, e.g.,  Stockwell et al., 1997). It is clear also that due to the crucial role of
OH  in  processes  of  ozone  formation,  the  gas-to-particle  conversion  processes  are  closely  linked
with complex photochemistry of ozone (e.g., Meng et al. 1997).

During  two  last  decades  the  significant  efforts  have  been  devoted  to  modeling  evolution  of
PM from the first principles; that is, the attempts have been made to describe all the most important
processes  affecting  formation  and  removal  of  air-borne  particles  explicitly  (see,  e.g.,  Pilinis  and
Seinfeld, 1988; Wexler  et  al.,  1994;  Binkowski and  Shankar, 1995; Jacobson, 1997;  Meng  et  al.,
1998; Ackermann et al., 1998; Sun and  Wexler, 1998; Nenes et al., 1999). Nonetheless, in spite of
the great progress in understanding and representation of PM evolution, the comparisons of model
results with measurements bear evidence that model predictions of PM level still contain significant
uncertainties.  Moreover,  it  still  remains  unknown  to  what  extent  the  chemical-transport  (CT)
models are accurate and reliable in predictions of responses of the PM level to changes of potential
PM precursors and in elaborating strategies of reduction of the PM level.

Taking into account close chemical coupling between PM and ozone, it is useful to note that
evaluation of adequacy of CT model predictions represents rather difficult problem in researches of
surface ozone as well (e.g.,  Sillman et al., 1999). In ozone studies, this problem arises, principally,
due  to  the  essential  non-linearity  of  dependence  of  ozone  production  on  concentrations  of  its
precursors (National Research Council (NRC), 1991). In view of this problem, several methods for
assessing  ozone  sensitivity  to  changes  of  its  precursors  have  been  developed  recently  (see,  e.g.,
Kleinman et al., 2000), which are based predominantly on the use of data of ambient measurements.
On  the  contrary,  similar  methods  concerning  PM  have  not  yet  been  proposed.  Moreover,  though
some nonlinear features of PM-NOx-VOC relationships have been discussed earlier (Finlayson-Pitts
and Pitts, 1986; Meng et al., 1997; Senfeld and Pandis, 1998), it still remains unclear whether these
features are general, or site and day specific.

Thus at present there exists the definite need in better understanding of relationships between
PM  and  its  gaseous  precursors,  as  well  as  the  need  in  developing  additional  methods  for  their
identification in the real environment. This paper presents results of the first attempt to study PM-
NOx-VOC  relationships  directly  on  the  basis  of  data  of  ambient  measurements.  The  analysis  is
conducted  by  means  of  the  novel  original  method,  the  essence  of  which  is  creation  of  empirical
nonlinear  statistical  models  based  on  artificial  neural  networks  (see,  e.g.,  Bishop,  1995).  Similar
method was successfully applied recently to studying nonlinear relationships between surface ozone
and  its  precursors  (Konovalov,  2002).  Though  neural  networks  are  widely  used  in  atmospheric
researches  (see,  e.g.,  the  overview  by  Gardner  and  Dorling,  1998),  they  are  commonly  considered
as  a  "black  box"  which  bears  little  understandable  information  of  scientific  or  practical  value.
However,  as  it  was  shown  in  our  previous  work  (Konovalov,  2002),  the  possibility  of  obtaining
useful  knowledge  about  physical  or  chemical  properties  of  a  natural  system  exists  if  the  neural
network is trained and analyzed properly.

In  this  study,  neural  networks  are  applied  for  analysis  of  data  of  routine  long-term
measurements (1980-1995 years) of total suspended particulate (TSP) in two air quality monitoring
stations  at  California.  Though  from  the  point  of  view  of  practical  usefulness  the  analysis  of  fine
fraction of PM (<2.5  m m) could be of most interest (taking into account new US national standard
for PM2.5 (Federal Register, 1997)), unfortunately, at present time the record of PM2.5 measurements
accompanied  with  simultaneous  measurements  of  NOx  and  VOC  is  not  long  enough  for  building
neural network models aimed at retrieval of PM-NOx-VOC  relationships.  Nonetheless,  we  believe
that  features  of  these  relationships  discussed  in  this  paper  are  fairly  robust  and  applicable  to  all
fractions of PM. It is hoped also that the method suggested in this paper will be successfully applied
to fine fraction of PM in not very far future.

This  study  utilizes  data-sets  of  measurements  of  TSP,  O3,  NOx,  and  total  volatile  organic
compounds (this quantity is referred to below as VOC) made in two air quality monitoring stations
at  South  Coast  Air  Basin,  California  during  1980-1995  (California  Air  Quality  Data,  1998).  The
stations were selected a priori based on announced spatial scale of observations (only stations with
the  urban  scale  (4-50  km)  of  ozone  and  NOx  observations  were  considered)  and  availability  of
synchronous  measurements  of  all  components  noted  above.  The  urban  scale  means  that  both
distribution of sources of pollutants and topographical situation in the neighborhoods of the station
are such that the appearance of strong spatial gradients of the corresponding pollutants is unlikely.

¢ N,  118031¢ 58¢
However, since a series of TSP measurements at  Reseda  is  significantly  shorter  than  at  other  two
stations (at  Reseda,  the  measurements  were  conducted  only  in  1980-1986),  the  data-set  from  this
station  was  not  analyzed.  Note  that  data  series  used  in  this  analysis  ended  in  1995,  because
measurements  of  VOC  at  South  Coast  Air  Basin  were  cancelled  that  year.  The  measurements  of
TSP (they present daily values of mass concentration) were conducted rather irregularly. The most
frequent interval of subsequent measurements were 6 days; however, there is number of much more
extended gaps in the data series. The measurements of gaseous species were much more regular and
were conducted usually each hour. Nonetheless, corresponding data series also contain a number of
gaps.  The  hourly  data  for  gaseous  species  were  averaged  from  10  to  18  o’clock  in  each  day  of
measurements. Such averaging were performed in order to get unique value of each component per
a  day  and  to  suppress  effects  of  possible  random  variations  of  species  concentrations  within  the
course  of  the  day.  Note  also  that  since  the  aim  of  this  study  is  to  analyze  manifestations  of
photochemical processes which are most active during light period of day, it is natural to consider
dependence of PM on day-time, but not night-time concentrations of gaseous pollutants. No doubt,
it  would  be  advantageous  to  use  TSP  data  for  the  same  period  of  a  day  as  NOx  and  VOC  data.
However,  it  is  reasonable  to  hope  that  neural  networks  themselves  are  able  to  retrieve  a  part  of
variations of daily mean TSP caused by variations of day-time concentrations of NOx and VOC.

The air quality data were matched by daily mean meteorological data from Climate Prediction
Center,  National  Ocean  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/).  Again,
it is reasonable to assume that the use of the meteorological data averaged over the same period of
day  as  gaseous  species  data  would  facilitate  to  the  better  quality  of  the  empirical  models.
Unfortunately, necessary free hourly meteorological data were not found.

Finally,  the  data-sets  analyzed  in  this  study  include  1880  and  1032  days  of  measurements  at
Azusa  and  Riverside-Rubidoux  stations,  respectively.  The  data  have  not  been  pre-selected  in  any
way.

3. Methodology

The basic assumption in creation of the empirical models for PM is that mass concentration of
TSP (this quantity is referred to below simply as PM) can be approximately represented as a sum of
a  nonlinear  function  (f) of  n  other  measured  values  xi,  i=1,…,  n  and  some  random  value  (d),
variations of which cannot be accounted for by variations of the arguments of f:

                                            PM=f(x1,…, xn) +d,                                                                         (4)
The  proper  choice  of  the  arguments  xi  is  the  most  critical  point  in  providing  usefulness  and
reliability  of  the  empirical  models.  Obviously,  the  arguments  should  include,  in  particular,  such
values, the dependence on which is to be studied. In this study, such values are gaseous precursors
of PM, that is, NOx and VOC. It would be of interest to consider other important gaseous precursors
such as NH3 and SO2, but adequate contemporary measurements of these species are not available.
It is prudent also to take into account other important factors which, presumably, can significantly
influence studied relationships. However, a number of such factors should not be too large. Indeed,
it is obvious that larger a number of arguments of a function, more data are needed to approximate
it  with  the  same  quality.  Taking  into  account  the  aforesaid,  we  have  included  in  the  PM  empirical

3

models  only  four  meteorological  values:  temperature,  specific  humidity,  and  two  horizontal
components  of  wind  speed.  The  empirical  models  with  an  additional  argument,  for  example,  total
cloud cover which was included in our ozone empirical models (Konovalov,  2002),  were  found  to
demonstrate  higher  diversity  between  them  in  properties  discussed  in  Section  4  than  the  models
without this argument, what is indicative of the deficit of data. Though, it was found that empirical
models  with  seven  arguments  retain  the  most  important  features  of  PM-NOx-VOC  relationships
found  with  the  models  with  six  argument.  Nonetheless,  we  believe  that  the  models  with  seven
arguments are less adequate and thus such models will not be considered here.

It is assumed further that f can be approximated by means of a neural network of the perceptron
type with one hidden layer (see, e.g., Bishop, 1995). That the  perceptron with just one hidden layer
is  capable  of  approximating  any  measurable  function  to  any  desired  degree  of  accuracy  has  been
proven by  Hornik et al. (1989). Mathematically, the  perceptron p(X)  with  one  hidden  layer  can  be
represented as follows:

where X=(x1,…, xn) is a vector of input values (that is, a vector of arguments of the function f),  wj,
w0,  wij ,  w j0  are weight coefficients, NN is a number of neurons in the network.

A procedure by which appropriate values of weights are determined is one of the key elements
of  the  methodology  of  this  study.  Such  a  procedure  is  usually  referred  to  as  a  training  algorithm.
Here a standard  backpropagation  algorithm  (e.g.,  Reed  and  Marks,  1999)  is  used  in  combination
with  early  stopping  method  (Nelson  and  Illingworth,  1991;  Sarle,  1995).  The  early  stopping  is
usually used to provide such an important property of a neural network as generalization. For most
applications generalization means that outputs of the network are able to approximate target values
with given inputs that are  not in the training set (Sarle, 2000). In case of this study, generalization
means that a neural net learns the regular relationships (f) which are valid for any arbitrary chosen
subset  of  the  considered  data-set  and  disregards  noisy  variations  (d ).  Implementation  of  the  early
stopping in this study includes the following steps. First, the sequence of days in the data-sets was
randomly mixed. Thereafter each of the data-sets were divided into two equal subsets: training and
validation  ones.  The  net  is  trained  with  the  training  subset  but  the  error  of  prediction  which  is
defined as

where  PMob and  PMn=p(X)  are  observed  and  predicted  PM  levels,  and  Nd  is  number  of  training
cases  (that  is,  the  total  number  of  days  presented  in  the  data-set),  is  controlled  with  the  validation
subset. The iterations are stopped as e

 reaches minimum.

The  direct  application  of  this  technique  for  creation  of  the  empirical  models  in  the  form  of  a
single  perceptron  (5)  meets  two  main  problems.  First,  it  cannot  be  neglected  a  priori  that
perceptrons with different numbers of neurons (NN) may give qualitatively different results. Second,
since  the  training  of  neural  networks  is  an  iteration  process,  the  results  may  depend  on  initial
assumption  regarding  weights  values.  To  resolve  these  problems,  we  considered  first,  to  what
degree  changes  of  NN  may  affect  quality  of  approximations  and  important  features  of  the
relationships  analyzed.  It  was  found,  in  particular,  that  the  dependence  of  e
  (see  (6))  on  NN,
averaged  over  a  large  number  of  single  perceptrons  with  different  random  initial  weights,  is
saturating, so that the systematic differences between perceptrons with different NN greater, at least,
than 20 are quite negligible. The similar result were obtained for dependencies of derivatives of PM
with respect to  NOx  and  VOC,  evaluated  from  (5),  on  NN.  Values  and,  especially,  signs  of  these
derivatives are the most important characteristics in the context of this study. Based on these results,
it was concluded that the dependence of the approximations on NN is not of any significance if NN
is  greater,  at  least,  than  20.  In  order  to  minimize  any  hypothetical  uncertainties  associated  with

choice  of  definite  value  of  NN  to  maximum  degree,  it  was  decided  to  include  in  the  model
perceptrons with different NN ranging from 21 to 30.

To get rid of uncertainty associated with initial values of weights, a large enough set of single
perceptrons (50 ones) with random initial weights were trained for each value of NN and a few best
perceptrons (5 ones) having minimum  e
 were included in the empirical model. Finally, the desired
empirical model is represented as the mean of outputs of the set of 50 networks, which includes five
“best” networks for each NN from 21 to 30:

That  the  uncertainties  in  results  of  the  empirical  models,  associated  with  choice  of  values  NN
and  initial  values  of  weights  are  indeed  quite  small  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  This  figure  presents
comparisons  of  evaluations  of  first  derivatives  of  PM  with  respect  to  VOC  obtained  from  pairs  of
empirical models created in general accordance to (7) but with NN ranging from 21 to 25 and from
26  to  30.  Each  point  in  the  graphs  represents  one  day  in  the  training  sub-set  of  the  data-sets.  It  is
seen  that  each  pair  of  independently  created  versions  of  the  empirical  models  gives  very  close
results. In particular, fractions of days for which estimated signs of  ¶ PM/¶ VOC values are different
in the different versions are only 2.1% and 3.1% for the Azusa and Riverside models, respectively.
It  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  the  uncertainty  of  the  full  empirical  models  (7),  associated  with  the
discussed factors, should be smaller than that of their component parts.

The  empirical  model  performances  in  representation  of  variability  of  PM  are  demonstrated  in
Fig.  2,  which  show  measured  values  of  PM  (from  the  training  sub-sets)  versus  those  evaluated  by
the  models.  It  is  quite  natural  that  the  models  do  not  reproduce  the  measured  values  exactly  since
they  are  intended  to  catch  only  a  part  of  total  variability,  associated  with  changes  of  the  factors
represented by the model arguments. It is seen, however, that this part is quite substantial. This fact
bear  evidence  that  the  model  arguments  indeed  include  values  which  strongly  influence  the  PM
level. The results for the validation subsets are quite similar.

Fig.  2.  The  empirical  model  evaluations  of  the  PM  concentrations  (axes  of  ordinates)  versus  actually  measured  PM
concentrations (axes of abscissas). Each point corresponds to one day at the training sub-set of the data-set. Solid lines
represent best linear fits of the relationships.

The  main  idea  of  the  analysis  of  the  empirical  models  consists  in  the  following.  It  is  assumed
that empirical models provide as precise as possible fits of actual PM-NOx-VOC relationships under
various  conditions  determined  by  values  of  the  arguments.  The  qualitative  features  of  these
relationships under the given conditions may be learned via evaluation of various derivatives of PM
with  respect  to  VOC  and  NOx.  For  example,  positive  first  derivative  PM  with  respect  to  VOC
means that the increase of the level of VOC, most probably, would cause the increase of the level of
PM under the given conditions; that is, the PM level demonstrates positive sensitivity to changes of
the  VOC  level.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  positive  first  derivatives  of  PM  with  respect  to
VOC or  NOx  may  reflect  simply  the  natural  correlation  between  the  levels  of  primary  PM  and
gaseous  pollutants  as  they  mainly  originate  from  the  same  emission  sources.  The  positive  second
derivative of PM  with  respect  to  VOC  under  the  same conditions means that the sensitivity would
increase  with  the  increase  of  VOC.  The  derivatives  that  present  interest  may  be  evaluated,  in
principle, under any values of argument from the range of observed conditions. However, the most
accurate evaluations are expected for conditions observed at days presented in the training sub-set
of the data-sets. The special investigation has shown that the evaluations of individual nets forming
the  empirical  models  for  the  conditions  that  are  not  in  the  training  subset,  including  those  that  are
presented  in  the  validation  sub-sets,  are  much  more  dispersed.  This  is,  presumably,  due  to  the  fact
that  each  individual  neural  network  included  in  the  model  is  learned  for  the  conditions  that  are  in
the  training  sub-set  but  has  significant  freedom  under  other  conditions.  Thus  it  was  chosen  to
analyze only the predictions made for the conditions observed at days presented in the training sub-
sets.

It  is  rather  obvious  that  PM-NOx-VOC  relationships  in  the  real  environment  under  windy
conditions  may  be  affected  by  peculiarities  of  distributions  of  sources  of  pollutants.  Thus,  after
creation  of  the  models,  it  was  found  to  be  necessary  to  make  the  approximation  of  no  wind
conditions.  That  is,  all  model  evaluations  were  made  with  values  of  wind  speed  put  in  (7)  to  be
zero.  Such  an  approximation  becomes  possible  as  similar  values  of  pollutant  concentrations,
temperature  and  humidity  can  be  associated  with  different  magnitudes  and  directions  of  wind.  No
wind conditions allow us to identify the effects associated with the local processes of formation of
secondary PM.

The obtained evaluations are analyzed subsequently in order to find some associations between
values  (and  signs)  of  different  derivatives  and  argument  values.  For  example,  it  is  considered,
whether  days  with  negative  values  of  first  derivatives  of  PM  with  respect  to  VOC  are  associated,
predominantly, with lower temperatures than days with the positive derivatives, or with higher ones.
If we had only one empirical model, any association of such type would be of little utility. Indeed, it
would not be possible to conclude then, whether the observed association is the indication of some
real regularity, or it is just a result of poor quality of the model, or an artifact of specific features of
statistical  distributions  of  argument  values.  However,  when  the  same  result  is  found  with  other
model  created  using  the  independent  data-set  obtained  in  a  quite  different  environment,  we  have
much  more  grounds  to  believe  that  this  result  is  indeed  a  consequence  of  some  general  regularity,
taking into account that untrained or trained with the random data-sets neural networks give random
outputs and thus cannot demonstrates any significant correlation between different output values, or
between output values and values of arguments.

4.  Results
4.1. PM-NOx relationship

The  rate  of  gas-to-particle  conversion  due  to  the  reactions  (1)-(3)  is  proportional  to  the
hydroxyl  radical  concentration.  Thus  it  can  be  expected  that  the  increase  of  the  OH  level  under
other  constant  conditions  would  lead  to  the  increase  of  PM  production,  and  vice  versa.  It  is  well
known that OH itself depends on  NOx in the essentially non-linear manner (see, for example,  Kley
et al., 1999). Specifically, OH increases with the increase of  NOx under low enough  NOx level, but
may  decrease  under  higher  NOx  level.  Thus,  there  is  a  possibility  that  the  decrease  of  NOx  may
actually  lead  to  the  increase  of  the  level  of  PM.  Though  this  idea  is  rather  obvious,  any
experimental  demonstration  of  this  possibility,  as  far  as  we  know,  has  not  been  discussed  in  peer
reviewed literature earlier.

In order to check this idea, we have evaluated (using (7)) first derivatives of PM with respect to
NOx (¶ PM/¶ NOx)  in  each  day  presented  in  the  training  sub-sets  of  the  data-sets.  It  was  found  that
though majority of these days are associated with positive  ¶ PM/¶ NOx,  there  are  a  few  of  them  (8
days  (of  940  ones  in  the  training  sub-set)  at  the  Azusa  station  and  6  days  (of  516  ones)  at  the
Riverside  station)  associated  with  ¶ PM/¶ NOx<0.  In  order  to  understand  the  origin  of  negative
¶ PM/¶ NOx in the empirical models, some additional analysis has been undertaken.

First, we have considered dependencies of PM on  NOx for all days with  ¶ PM/¶ NOx<0.  Such
dependencies  are  shown  in  Fig.  3.  They  were  calculated  from  (7)  assuming  that  all  model
arguments except NOx have fixed values corresponding to the days considered. The general features
of  all  these  dependencies  are  the  presence  of  their  growing  parts  under  lower  levels  of  NOx  and
falling parts under higher levels of  NOx. The same features are characteristic for the dependence of
OH on  NOx (Kley  et  al.,  1999).  Some  of  the  dependencies  for  the  Azusa  station  possess  growing
parts also under highest values of NOx. Most likely, this growth is an artifact of the empirical model
and caused by insufficient number of data with high values of NOx. Indeed, the days with  NOx>120
ppb constitute less than 3% of total number of days in the data-set for the Azusa station.

Second,  it  was  found  that  at  both  stations,  days  with  ¶ PM/¶ NOx<0  are  associated,  on  the
average, with significantly higher concentrations of NOx (107 ppb at the Azusa station and 110  ppb
at  the  Riverside  station),  higher  concentrations  of  VOC  (2.43  ppmC  and  2.61  ppmC)  and  lower
temperatures (18.8 0C and 14.60C), as compared with corresponding values averaged over the whole
data sets (58.5 ppb and 31.6  ppb; 2.38 ppmC and 2.21  ppmC;  22.20C and 20.40C at the Azusa and
Riverside stations, respectively). Regarding influence of VOC level on values of  ¶ PM/¶ NOx it was
found additionally that at both stations, all days except one at the Azusa station are associated with
positive values of mixed second derivative  ¶ 2PM/¶ VOC¶ NOx.  It  means  that  the  increase  of  VOC
level actually facilitates to the less negative values  ¶ PM/¶ NOx. Thus the noted above association of
days when ¶ PM/¶ NOx<0 with higher concentrations of VOC is, most probably, just a result of

positive correlation of ambient VOC and  NOx  levels.  Any  common,  for  both  models,  association
between the signs of  ¶ PM/¶ NOx  and  second  order  derivatives  of  PM  with  respect  to  temperature
and NOx were not found. That, most probably, indicates of significant uncertainty of evaluations of
these  derivatives.  It  is  known  from  the  theory  (see,  for  example,  Kleinman, 1994;  Sillman,  1999)
that  higher  NOx  level,  lower  insolation  (which  can  be  expected  to  be  associated  with  lower
temperature) and lower VOC level facilitate to the  NOx-rich  regime,  when  radical  level  falls  with
the increase of  NOx. Thus, the noted results of the empirical models are, at least, do not contradict
to the hypothesis that negative sensitivity of PM to NOx has the photochemical origin.

Finally, let us discuss the reasons of smallness of a fraction of days with  ¶ PM/¶ NOx<0. We see
two possible reasons. On the one hand, as  NOx  itself  can  be  incorporated  into  particulate  material
according to mechanism (2), (3), it is obvious that the ridge in dependence of PM on  NOx should be
shifted  toward  higher  values  of  NOx,  in  comparison  with  the  ridge  in  dependence  of  OH  on  PM
under the same conditions, and thus a fraction of days with  ¶ PM/¶ NOx<0 should be smaller than a
fraction of days with  ¶ OH/¶ NOx<0.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  real  environment,  the  level  of  NOx
may  correlate  with  intensity  of  the  primary  emission  of  PM  or/and  with  the  levels  of  other
precursors of PM, such as NH3 or SO2, which are not included in the empirical models. Obviously,
such  correlation  would  lead  to  a  persistent  positive  shift  in  ¶ PM/¶ NOx  values  evaluated  by  the
empirical models. Nonetheless, in our opinion, even with regard of quantitative uncertainties of the
empirical model evaluations, the possibility of negative sensitivity of PM level to change of  NOx is
established here rather firmly.

4.2. 

PM-VOC relationship

4.2.1. Empirical results

Let  us  note  at  the  beginning  that  first  evidence  for  the  essential  non-linearity  of  PM-VOC
relationship  was  found  by  Meng  et  al.  (1997)  in  results  of  their  PM-CT  model  simulation  of
changes of PM2.5 level in response to changes in rates of emission of  NOx  and  VOC  at  Riverside,
California, under conditions of 28 August 1987. They found, in particular, that the decrease of VOC
emission rate may lead either to the increase or decrease of PM2.5 level, depending on the base case
for NOx  and  VOC  emission  rates.  Specifically,  greater  (by  absolute  value)  negative  sensitivity  of
PM  level  to  changes  of  VOC  level  was  found,  in  most  cases  considered,  under  higher  levels  of
VOC. Unfortunately, fruitful comparison of the results by  Meng et al. (1987) with results obtained

8

by  the  empirical  models  is  hardly  possible  because  of  the  following  reasons.  (1)  The  model  by
Meng et al. and the empirical models use different measure of PM (PM2.5  and  TSP,  respectively).
(2)  The  arguments  of  the  empirical  models  are  surface  concentrations  of  NOx  and  VOC,  but  not
their  emission  rates.  Thus  the  empirical  models  cannot  account,  for  example,  for  the  possible
changes of NOx surface concentration after changes of VOC emission rate. (3) The results of  Meng
et  al.  concern  maximum  1-hour  average  concentration  of  PM,  whereas  our  empirical  models  deal
with  daily  averaged  level  of  PM.  Nonetheless,  the  consideration  of  dependence  of  PM  on  VOC
given by the empirical model for the Riverside station under conditions of August 28, 1987 reveals
that  this  dependence  is  also  essentially  non-monotonous  and  that  high  enough  values  of  VOC
correspond to negative sensitivity of PM to VOC, whereas the lower ones facilitate to the positive
sensitivity.

Empirical  model  evaluations  of  first  derivative  of  PM  with  respect  to  VOC  (¶ PM/¶ VOC)
shows  that  some  of  the  days  presented  in  the  data-sets  are  associated  with  negative  sensitivity  of
PM to changes of VOC and others with positive one. These evaluations are plotted in Fig. 4 and 5
against  temperature  and  concentration  of  VOC  observed  at  corresponding  days,  respectively.  It  is
seen, in particular, that noticeable fractions of days (namely, 6.7% at the Azusa station and 31.4% at
the  Riverside  station)  have  negative  values  of  ¶ PM/¶ VOC.  Furthermore,  the  points  with
¶ PM/¶ VOC<0  in  Fig.  4  are  not  distributed  uniformly  but  tend  “to  avoid”  definite  ranges  of
moderately  warm  temperatures,  thus  forming  a  “butterfly-like”  structures.  Solid  curves  represent
polynomial (of the 4th order) fits of the data and illustrate non-linear character of dependence (in the
statistical  sense)  of  ¶ PM/¶ VOC  on  temperature.  These  features  allow  us  to  hypothesize  that
different  processes  drive  behavior  of  PM  under  low  and  high  temperatures.  This  hypothesis  finds
further  confirmation  in  Fig.  5,  where  points  are  separated  into  high-temperature  and  low-
temperature  “modes”:  the  threshold  temperatures  are  chosen  to  be  equal  to  180C  at  the  Azusa
station  and  220Ñ  at  the  Riverside  station  and  marked  in  Fig.  4  by  dash-dot  vertical  lines.
Specifically, it is seen that, under low enough VOC level, the high-temperature mode is associated
dominantly with positive ¶ PM/¶ VOC, whereas the majority of the points with negative ¶ PM/¶ VOC
belong to the low-temperature mode. In contrast, under high enough VOC level, the most part of the
points with ¶ PM/¶ VOC<0 belong to the high-temperature mode. The noted features give an idea to
perform separate analysis of PM-VOC relationships in the different temperature modes.

Fig.  5.  The  empirical  model  evaluations  of  first  derivatives  of  concentrations  of  PM  with  respect  to  concentration  of
VOC,  plotted  against  values  of  ambient  concentration  of  VOC.  Dots  and  crosses  correspond  to  low-temperature  and
high-temperature modes, respectively.

Table  1  presents  average  values  of  PM  (measured),  VOC,  NOx,  T,  and  RH,  calculated
separately  for  high  temperature  and  low  temperature  modes  and  with  the  additional  separation  of
days with regard to the sign of predicted value of  ¶ PM/¶ VOC in the given day. This table presents
also  day  fractions  (of  total  number  of  days  in  the  given  temperature  mode)  satisfying  to  certain
conditions concerning values of temperature, the sign of ¶ PM/¶ VOC, and the sign of corresponding
second order derivatives of PM. It is worth to note the following general for both models features.
First,  in  the  low  (high)  temperature  mode,  the  average  values  of  PM,  VOC,  NOx,  and  T  is  less
(greater) in days with negative  ¶ PM/¶ VOC than in the days with positive  ¶ PM/¶ VOC. Second, the
minority  (majority)  of  days  have  negative  values  of  ¶ 2PM/¶ VOC2 and  ¶ 2PM/¶ T¶ VOC  in  the  low
(high)  temperature  mode.  Values  of  relative  humidity  do  not  demonstrate  general  for  both  models
changes with changes of the sign of  ¶ PM/¶ VOC.  There  may  be  just  two  reasons  for  that.  First,  at
least  one  of  the  models  did  not  “learn”  the  relations  between  ¶ PM/¶ VOC  and  RH  satisfactorily.
Second,  these  relations  are  indeed  qualitatively  different  in  different  environments.  At  the  given
state  of  knowledge  of  these  relationships,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  which  of  two  reasons  is
true. The similar situation takes place with the behavior of  ¶ 2PM/¶ NOx¶ VOC.  The  only  common
feature is that the ratio of number of days having both negative  ¶ 2PM/¶ NOx¶ VOC and ¶ PM/¶ VOC
to number of days with negative  ¶ PM/¶ VOC (this ratio can be obtained by dividing the number in
the 8th row of the table to that in the 1st  row)  is  significantly  less  than  0.5  at  the  high  temperature
mode.  An  attempt  to  identify  physical  and  chemical  reasons  for  noted  features  is  described  in  the
following section.

4.2.2.  Discussion of PM-VOC relationship

First  of  all,  it  is  necessary  to  note  that  the  following  discussion  does  not  pursue  the  notion  of
exact  identification  of  the  processes  which  cause  the  noted  above  features  of  PM-VOC
relationships.  Such  identification  is  out  of  the  scope  of  this  paper  and  would  require  in-detail
consideration  of  complex  processes  that  drive  evolution  of  PM  at  the  given  site.  Here,  we  would
like  to  formulate  and  substantiate,  wherever  possible,  the  most  plausible  hypotheses  for  the
explanation of the empirically obtained relationships.

We  believe  that  the  main  factor  driving  formation  of  secondary  PM  in  the  high-temperature
mode is the behavior of OH radical. The behavior of OH radical is directly related to the behavior
of  ozone  and  underline  qualitative  nonlinear  features  of  O3-NOx-VOC  relationships,  which  was

extensively  studied  during  two  last  decades  (see,  for  example,  NRC,  1991).  Correspondingly,  the
key  processes  responsible  for  the  essential  general  nonlinear  features  of  the  dependence  of  OH  on
VOC and  NOx  have  also  been  identified  earlier.  In  particular,  those  features  were  explained  by
Sillman  (1990,  1995)  by  means  of  the  mechanistic  model  based  on  the  equation  of  the  radical
budget.  Below  it  is  demonstrated  that  the  main  empirical  features  of  PM-VOC  relationships,
discussed above, are closely associated with features OH-VOC relationships given by the  Sillman’s
model.  Note  that  the  use  of  the  mechanistic  model  in  this  study  appears  to  be  quite  natural,  as  our
desire  here  is  to  appeal  to  the  most  general  qualitative  properties  of  the  tropospheric
photochemistry.  For  the  sake  of  clarity  of  the  following  discussion,  it  is  worth  to  give  here  brief
description of this model, with inessential modifications.

It includes schematic representation of the sequence of the essential processes determining the
sources  and  sinks  of  the  radicals  OH,  HO2  and  RO2.  (The  latter  denotes  the  organic  radicals.)
Specifically, RO2 radicals are formed in the reaction of a hydrocarbon (RH) with OH,
(R1)                                                        RH+OHﬁ RO2+H2O

The instantaneous equilibrium of RO2 radicals is provided by the reaction

(R2)                                              RO2+NOﬁ HO2+NO2+products,

which also provide the source of HO2 radical, whose concentration is balanced by reaction (R3)
HO2+NOﬁ OH+NO2

A magnitude of the sum of concentrations of OH, HO2 and RO2 radicals (this sum is called as

odd hydrogen) is determined by the equation of the radical budget,

greater  S1)).  It  is  clear  that  in  the  real  atmosphere,  those  are  associated  with  greater,  on  average,
temperature. These features may be responsible for the appearance of the negative sensitivity of PM
to  changes  of  VOC  at  the  high-temperature  mode,  the  association  of  days  with  ¶ PM/¶ VOC  with
higher temperatures and the dominance of negative values of ¶ 2PM/¶ T¶ VOC at those days.

It  is  obvious  also  from  (10)  that  a  similar  “switch”  from  ¶

responsible  for  the  empirical  facts  that  the  high-temperature  mode  is  mostly  associated  with
negative values of  ¶ 2PM/¶ VOC2, that days with  ¶ PM/¶ VOC<0  at  the  high-temperature  mode  are
associated with higher values of VOC and, mostly, with positive values of  ¶ 2PM/¶ NOx¶ VOC. Note
that  x  and  y  are  involved  in  (10)  asymmetrically.  Specifically,  in  the  situation  with  a >>1,  the

the  empirical  fact  that  domination  of  ¶ 2PM/¶ VOC2<0  takes  place  independently  on  the  sign  of
¶ PM/¶ VOC  at  the  high  temperature  mode,  whereas  domination  of  ¶ 2PM/¶ NOx¶ VOC>0  is  found
only in days with ¶ PM/¶ VOC<0.

We believe that conditions associated with the low-temperature mode correspond, generally, to
a >>1.  Indeed,  the  CT  model  evaluations  (see,  for  example,  Milford  et  al.,  1994)  show  that
significant areas at South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) are under  NOx-saturated  conditions  (that  is,  in
terms of our model, with a >0) even in the hot and sunny days. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that
significant  decrease  of  insolation  in  colder  seasons  would  drive  the  photochemistry  of  SCAB  into
conditions with  a >>0.  Under  these  conditions  concentration  of  OH  is  relatively  small  and,  as  a
result,  the  behavior  of  PM  in  the  low-temperature  mode  is  affected  by  non-chemical  processes  to
much greater extent than that in the high-temperature mode. In particular, it can be speculated that
dominating positive values of ¶ 2PM/¶ VOC2 at low-temperature mode are associated, in part, with a
physically evident possibility that the increase of total concentration of hydrocarbons is associated
with  the  increase  of  number  of  individual  semi-volatile  hydrocarbons  reaching  the  saturation.
Consequently, the increase of measured total concentration of volatile hydrocarbons (that is, VOC)
may  be  associated  with  the  increase  of  the  ratio  of  total  concentration  of  hydrocarbons  in  the
condensed  phase  to  concentration  of  VOC,  and  as  a  result,  with  positive  values  of  ¶ 2PM/¶ VOC2.
However,  the  same  effect  can  be  caused  by  the  chemical  processes  of  formation  of  PM  via
oxidation of volatile hydrocarbons [Odum et al., 1996; 1997]. The rate of formation of PM due to
these processes is proportional to the product of concentrations of VOC and OH, that is, in terms of
Eq.  (8),  it  is  proportional  to  xn
/¶ x2>0.  This
process  may  account  also  for  substantial  fraction  of  days  with  ¶ 2PM/¶ VOC2>0  at  the  high-
temperature mode.

.  It  is  easy  to  see  that  in  situation  with  a >>1,  ¶ 2xn

The  most  speculative  point  of  this  discussion  concerns  the  reasons  for  negative  sensitivity  of
PM  to  VOC  under  very  low,  relatively,  temperatures.  We  failed  to  find  any  photochemical  reason
for  this,  consistent  with  majority  of  the  empirical  facts.  It  can  be  assumed  that  the  increase  of
concentration  of  VOC,  associated  with  the  increase  of  concentration  of  condensed  semi-volatile
hydrocarbons,  counteracts  to  condensation  of  inorganic  semi-volatile  species  such  as  NH4NH3  by
providing a hydrophobic  film on the surface of  aerosol particles and thus leads, effectively, to the
increase  of  saturation  vapor  pressure,  or  to  the  decrease  of  value  of  Henry’s  law  constant.  At
present, we do not aware of experimental or theoretical data that would allow us to estimate actual
possibility  and  significance  of  this  effect.  Under  higher  temperatures,  which  are  associated,
presumably,  with  less  a
/a y  when
a >>1),  this  effect  is  suppressed,  probably,  by  the  more  rapid  increase  of  concentration  of  semi-
volatile inorganic species with the increase of VOC. This effect may be suppressed also because of
the  increase  of  fraction  of  organic  aerosol  with  the  increase  of  concentration  of  VOC  under  the
same  temperature.  Anyway,  it  is  evident  that  results  of  the  empirical  models  concerning  the  low-
temperature conditions pose very interesting questions for further researches.

5.  Summary and conclusions

This  paper  presents  results  of  the  first  attempt  of  analysis  of  nonlinear  relationships  between
particulate  matter  and  its  gaseous  precursors  based  on  observational  data.  The  analysis  of  the  long
term  monitoring  data  at  South  Coast  Air  Basin,  California,  is  performed  by  means  of  original
method  which  assumes  creation  of  the  empirical  models  based  on  the  artificial  neural  networks.
Such  models  does  not  involve  any  a  priori  assumptions  regarding  character  of  analyzed
relationships.  The  reliability  of  results  of  this  study  is  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  two  empirical
models created using independent data-sets which are obtained in two different monitoring stations
separated  by  a  distance  more  than  50  km  manifest  a  number  of  common  qualitative  features  of
relationships between PM, VOC and  NOx.  The  models  are  assumed  to  provide  the  best  fit  for  the
real PM-VOC-NOx relationships under different observed values of temperature, relative humidity,
and  horizontal  wind  speed.  In  order  to  suppress  effects  caused  by  transport  of  PM  from  different
areas  and  to  emphasize  the  features  of  PM-VOC-NOx  relationships  determined  by  the  local
formation  of  PM,  the  approximation  of  zero  wind  speed  is  enforced  in  the  models.  With  this
approximation, the models are used to evaluate different derivatives of PM with respect to VOC and
NOx  under  conditions  corresponding  to  a  number  of  days  presented  in  the  data-sets.  These

evaluations  are  used  further  to  identify  general,  in  the  statistical  sense,  regularities  of  PM-VOC-
NOx relationships.

It is found, in particular, that there are conditions when PM demonstrates a negative sensitivity
to changes of  NOx, or VOC (that is, when first derivatives of PM with respect to  NOx or VOC are
negative).  It  is  found  also  that  negative  sensitivity  of  PM  to  NOx  is  facilitated  by  higher  ambient
NOx concentrations and lower temperatures and VOC concentrations. These features are consistent
with the hypothesis that the non-linearity of PM-NOx  relationships  is  caused  by  the  corresponding
non-linearity of dependence of concentration of hydroxyl radical (OH) on NOx.

The  qualitative  features  of  relationships  between  PM  and  VOC  are  found  to  depend  in  non-
linear  manner  on  temperature.  In  view  of  this  dependence  it  is  turned  out  to  be  fruitful  to  separate
analyzed days into two “modes” with respect to value of temperature (T) observed at those days: the
high-temperature  mode  and  the  low-temperature  one,  with  the  threshold  temperature  to  be  about
200C. Consequently, the PM-VOC relationships are analyzed for each temperature mode separately.
It  is  found  that  at  the  low-temperature  mode,  the  appearance  of  negative  sensitivity  of  PM  with
respect to VOC is facilitated by lower temperatures and VOC concentrations, whereas positive and
greater values of the sensitivity correspond to higher temperatures and VOC concentrations. At the
high-temperature mode, the overall picture is inverse: the appearance of negative sensitivity of PM
with  respect  to  VOC  is  facilitated  by  higher  temperatures  and  VOC  concentrations,  whereas
positive  and  greater  values  of  the  sensitivity  correspond  to  lower  temperatures  and  VOC
concentrations.

It  is  argued  that  the  most  significant  features  of  PM-VOC-NOx  relationships  at  the  high-
temperature  mode  are  closely  associated  with  the  similar  features  of  OH-VOC-NOx  relationships,
whereas  the  behavior  of  PM  at  the  low  temperature  mode  is  strongly  perturbed  by  peculiarities  of
the processes of condensation of primary and secondary semi-volatile compounds.

In  our  opinion,  the  empirical  results  of  this  study  provide  the  rich  “food”  for  the  further
theoretical  analysis.  The  main  condition  of  further  successful  applications  of  this  methodology  is
availability of long enough concurrent measurements of PM and its main gaseous precursors. Up to
now,  there  were  only  a  few  stations  satisfying  to  this  criteria.  Moreover,  unfortunately,  the
necessary  measurements  of  VOC  at  air  pollution  monitoring  stations  at  California  were  almost
cancelled  at  1995  and  thus  it  is  not  possible  to  apply  this  methodology  for  assessment  PM-NOx-
VOC  relationships  at  the  present-day  situation.  Nonetheless,  in  the  near  future,  the  same
methodology may be applied to the analysis of data of PM2.5  and  PM  precursors  measurements  at
the  Photochemical  Assessment  Monitoring  Stations  (PAMS)  at  US  (US  Environmental  Protection
Agency,  1994),  which  have  begun  to  operate  in  recent  years.  Anyway,  the  results  of  this  study
emphasize  the  importance  and  fruitfulness  of  concurrent  and  long-term  measurements  of  coupled
parameters of the atmospheric environment.

Results of this study indicate that the elaboration of the effective strategy for reduction of PM
level  can  present  a  rather  difficult  problem  in  view  of  essential  non- linearities  of  relationships
between PM and its gaseous precursors. These non- linearities should be studied further.

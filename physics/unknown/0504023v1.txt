Abstract 

Influence  of  Coriolis  force  on  propagation  and  reflection  of  the  stimulated  long  waves 

generated pulsing and harmonic concentrated sources is studied. Geostrophic stream are found, 

is received asymptotics for transition mode. It is established that in case of presence of rectilinear 

boundary as a result of reflection Kelvin wave propagating along a boundary is formed. 

 

Introduction 

In  geophysical  hydrodynamics  a  few  precisely  solved  theoretical  problems  which 

solution  is  expressed  by  compact  analytical  formulas  due  to  what  there  is  possible  a  simple 

physical analysis of the process. Problems concern to them about influence of Coriolis force on 

propagation and reflection of the long waves considered in [1 – 3]. 

Apparently, this theme has not received development though, in our opinion, it deserves 

more a attention. In [1] cases of action of a pulsing and harmonic source in the boundless sea are 

considered. It is established that in both cases geostrophic stream is formed. In the second case 

there  are  steady-stated  waves  with  frequency  of  the  source  propagating  from  a  source  on 

perpetuity.  Besides  there  is  transition  mode.  But  the  used  technique  is  difficult  enough.  The 

question  on  simplification  of  a  technique  of  the  solution  is  important  as  used  in  [2]  technique 

give the erroneous results; in particular there in a spectrum of the reflected wave Kelvin wave is 

We repeatedly consider these problems with the purpose to simplify and add the solution 

not outlined.

Let's assume that flat reservoir of depth h filled with an ideal incompressible fluid rotates 

with constant angular velocity 

0ω  around of a vertical axis. The axis z of the cartesian coordinate 

system coincides with an axis of reservoir rotation. The equations of the stimulated linear long 

waves in such fluid look like [4]

is convenient to define representing function S(x, y, t) through which η,  u ,  v  are expressed as

It is easy to check up that in this case the first and second equations in (1) are satisfied 

automatically  and  last  equation  is  reduced  to  non-uniform  two-dimensional  Klein  –Gordon

Let's consider also potential vorticity 

tyxσ
),
,(

 which is expressed as follows: 

Using Eqs. (1) it is possible to obtain the equation for potential vorticity: 

σ

=

)

+

.
f
η

   

t =σ

fJ

. 

 

 

 

 

From Eq. (7) follows, that in case of absence of sources value of potential vorticity in each point 

of fluid does not vary in due course. However with the help of potential vorticity it is possible to 

outline  geostrofic  stream  for  various  distributions  of    sources  and  the  limited  reservoir  with 

boundaries of an any configuration directly, not solving initial Eqs. (1). 

 

Geostrophic stream 

In geostrophic stream fields are stationary therefore in case of absence of sources the Eqs. 

(1) becomes:

Then, Eqs. (2) which give expression η, u, v through representing function become simpler:

Now  it  is  possible  to  conclude:  let  any  time  the  sources  creating  spatial  distribution  of 

yield 

iJ  which does not depend on time operate; then a bit later after the ending of their action 

formating  of  geostrophic  stream  is  finished,  fields  in  which  are  defined  through  representing 

function under Eqs. (9), and representing function will be the solution of Helmholtz equation

This  feature  of  geostrophic  stream  does  enough  procedure  of  determination  of

are reduced to the solving of Helmholtz equation. Simplifies procedure that here is not required 

to use a Sommerfeld condition of radiation. Besides from equalities (9) follows that representing 

function of geostrophic stream be converted in zero on reservoir boundary. For example, using a 

method of reflections and the formula (12) we receive that Green functions in cases of half-space

The  formula  (27)  shows  that  transition  mode  represents  running  inertial  waves  with 

amplitude slowly dumped in due course, in inverse proportion t. It is obvious that the real parts 

of  formulas  (23)  –  (25)  define  an  displacement  caused  by  a  source  with  yield 

Q ω , 
cos( t

imaginary  –  with  yield 

Q ω .  Using  Eqs.  (2)  from  (18)  and  (22)  it  is  possible  to  find  an 

sin( t

)

displacement of a free surface and components of fluid velocity. 

 

Separately  we  shall  consider  a  case  of  concurrence  of  sourse  frequency  with  inertial 

(resonance).  In  this  case  equations  (26)  for  the  steady-stated  mode  are  inapplicable,  since  at 

f=ω   Hankel  and  Macdonald  function  of  the  zero  order  have  singularities.  However  we  are 

interested with physical quantities, instead of representing function. For source function in this 

case  we  have

Pulsing concentrated source in the sea with rectilinear coast

pulsing concentrated source with power Q in the sea with a rectilinear coast y=0. We count that 

waves  are  propagated  in  the  sea  medium  which  fills  half-space  y>0.  The  source  is  in  a  point

First  four  terms  in  the  solution  (43)  correspond  to  a  direct  wave,  the  others  –  to  the  waves 

reflected from boundary. 

The solution (43) represents the fundamental solution of a problem (1) with a condition 

that  normal  velocity  should  vanish  on  rectilinear  coastal  boundary.  For  more  complex  source 

function  J  the  solution  obtains  by  convolution.  For  the  sources  distributed  in  space,  the 

displacement of a free surface will not have infinite breaks on forward front as these features will 

be eliminated as a result of integration on coordinates. 

For example, in case of the harmonic concentrated source solution for displacement will 

obtain  of  convolution  of  function  H(t)exp(iωt)  with  function  (43).  There  is  no  necessity 

completely to give the solution of this problem. Let's outline only Kelvin wave

Obviously,  formula  (44)  describes  the  harmonic  wave  propagating  along  a  coast  in  a  positive 

direction with a source frequency. 

Pulsing concentrated source in the channel 

The  result  obtained  in  the  previous  section  suggests  that  it  is  possible  to  expect 

occurrence  of  Kelvin  waves  in  case  of  boundaries  of  more  complex  configuration.  With  the 

purpose of confirmation of the given hypothesis we shall consider propagation of the stimulated

waves in the reclinear channel of width d. Let the concentrated source with power Q is in a point 

(0, y0), 0<y0<d. For the solving of Eqs. (1) we shall take advantage of Laplace transform on time 

with  parameter  p  and  Fourier  transform  on  x  with  parameter  k.  The  Eqs.  (1)  with  boundary 

conditions become:

In  the  present  paper  influence  of  Coriolis  force  on  propagation  and  reflection  of  long 

waves  is  studied.  Initiating  of  function  (2)  for  Eqs.  (1)  has  allowed  to  obtain  for  representing 

function non-uniform Klein – Gordon equation (3). For the sources working during a finite time 

interval, the simple way of a finding of geostrophic stream is offered.  

 

Consideration  of  process  of  reflection  of  a  wave  does  not  apply  for  completeness. 

Obviously,  the  stated  technique  allows  to  study  reflection  of  a  wave  from  boundaries  of  more 

complex  configuration  than  a  rectilinear  coast  or  channel.  It  is  possible  to  expect  in  this  case 

occurrence  in  a  spectrum  of  the  reflected  wave  of  Kelvin  waves  propagating  along  boundaries 

and exponential damping with distance from its.

Radiostrontium activity concentrations in milk in the Republic of Croatia for

1961 - 2001 and dose assessment

Z. Franic#, N. Lokobauer and G. Marovic*

ABSTRACT 

Results of systematic measurements of  90Sr activity concentrations in milk for the period 1961 -

2001  are  summarized.  An  exponential  decline  of  radioactivity  followed  the  moratorium  on

atmospheric nuclear testing. The highest activity of 90Sr deposited by fallout, being 1060  Bq m-2,

was recorded in 1963, while the peak 90Sr activity concentration in milk, 1.42 ± 0.17 Bq L-1, was

recorded in 1964. The values in year 2001 for fallout deposition and milk were 7.7   Bq m-2 and

0.07 ± 0.03 Bq L-1, respectively. The reactor accident at Chernobyl caused higher 90Sr levels only

in 1986. 90Sr fallout activity affects milk activity, the coefficient of correlation between 90Sr fallout

activity and 90Sr activity  concentrations in milk being 0.80. The transfer coefficient from fallout

deposition to milk was estimated to be 2.5 × 10-3 Bq y L-1  per Bq m-2. The dose incurred by milk

consumption was estimated for the Croatian population, the annual collective effective dose in 2001

being approximately 2.0 man-Sv.

INTRODUCTION

The dominant route for the introduction of artificial radionuclides into the environment until the

nuclear accident in Chernobyl, Ukraine, on 26 April 1986, has been the radioactive fallout resulting

from atmospheric nuclear weapon tests. Atmospheric nuclear explosions have been conducted since

1945 and were specially intensive in the 1960s, i.e., before a moratorium on atmospheric nuclear

tests became effective. However, similar, but smaller tests were conducted by the Chinese and

French in the 1970s until 1980. The radioactivity of most environmental samples, including those

that enter human food chain, is usually in good correlation with fallout activity, i.e., surface deposit

in Bq m-2 (UNSCEAR 1982; UNSCEAR 1988). Among the anthropogenic radionuclides present in

global fallout, 137Cs and 90Sr have been regarded as the fission products of a major potential hazard

to living beings due to the unique combination of their relatively long half-lifes, and their chemical

and  metabolic  properties  resembling  those  of  the  potassium  and  calcium,  respectively.  Milk,

containing both potassium and calcium is, therefore, the sensitive indicator for presence of fission

products in the environment. In addition, milk as the very important foodstuff in Croatian dietary

habits, is potentially a major source of radioactive contamination. Consequently, investigations of

radiostrontium and radiocaesium in dairy milk take significant part of an extended and still on going

monitoring program of radioactive contamination of the environment in Croatia (Popovic 1963 -

1978; Bauman et al. 1979 - 1992; Kovac et al. 1993 - 1998; Marovic et al. 1999 - 2002.). In this

paper we have summarized the results of long-term systematic measurements of radiostrontium

activity in milk.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Fallout samples were collected monthly in the city of Zagreb at the location of the Institute for

Medical  Research  and  Occupational  Health  (45°50'  N,  15°59'  E).  The  other  fallout  sampling

locations are the cities of Zadar on the Adriatic coast (44°06' N, 15°15' E) and Osijek in eastern

Croatia (45°33' N, 18°42' E). The funnels used for fallout collection had 1 m2 area. The precipitation

amount was measured by Hellman pluviometer. In order to account for dry deposition (i.e., activity

deposited by particle settling and other “dry” processes) for periods when there was no precipitation,

funnels were rinsed by 1 L of distilled water (U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare

1967, U.S. Department of Energy, 1957 - 1997.)

Samples of milk, produced by Zagreb dairy, were purchased on daily basis in a quantity of

1 L. The Zagreb diary collects milk from local farmers all over Croatia, and after processing supplies

milk for majority of Croatian population through markets and supermarkets. Cumulative monthly

samples    were  analyzed  monthly  by  taking  aliquot.  In  the  1960s,  90Sr  was  determined  by  the

conventional radiochemical analysis with fuming nitric acid separation. From 1970 to the present,

90Sr was determined by extraction with tributyl phosphate, except in the year of the Chernobyl

nuclear accident, when fuming nitric acid was also used.

After the radiochemical treatment of fallout and milk samples (U.S. Department of Energy,

1957 - 1997), the radioactivity of 90Sr was determined by counting the beta emission from its decay

product, 90Y, in a low-background, anti-coincidence, shielded Geiger-Müller counter. Counting time

depended on 90Sr activity concentration in samples, but was never less than 60,000 s, typically being

80,000 s. The values of ± 2σ counting errors were approximately 10% of the reported values of

activity concentrations. The efficiency calibration was carried out using sources provided by the

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Quality control is performed on monthly basis by

3

measuring blank samples and standards. Quality assurance and intercalibrations of radioactivity

measurements were performed through participation in the IAEA and WHO international quality

control programs.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Fallout

The highest recorded  90Sr activity deposited in Croatia, 1060 Bq m-2, was recorded in Zagreb in

1963. Ever since that time 90Sr fallout activities decreased exponentially, until the nuclear accident

in Chernobyl that caused a minor increase of 90Sr activity in fallout. However, due to the prevailing

meteorological conditions at the time after the accident that influenced the formation and direction

of Chernobyl plumes, in Croatia the  90Sr peak (surface deposition being about 210 Bq m-2) was

recorded only in fallout collected in the city of Zagreb, which was affected by the edge of the plume

as indicated on the Figure 1. In fallout samples collected on other places in Croatia (Zadar and

Osijek), 90Sr activity concentrations were not detected.

Figure 1 about here

Unlike the debris from the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, the radionuclides that originated

from the Chernobyl accident were not released directly into the upper atmosphere. As the result of

the  release  mechanism  and  the  meteorological  conditions,  the  refractory  components  of  the

Chernobyl debris (e.g., 90Sr) were deposited closer to the accident location than the more volatile

constituents (e.g., radiocaesium) (UNSCEAR 1988; Aarkrog 1988). Thus, 90Sr was not subjected

to the global dispersion processes, and was deposited on the Earth's surface within a period of a few

4

days to a few weeks after the accident. In addition, the late spring and early summer of 1986 in

Croatia were rather dry, which was especially true for the Adriatic region, leading to relatively low

direct radioactive contamination of environment (Franic and Bauman 1993; Franic et al. 1999).

Consequently, due to much lesser volatility of strontium compared to caesium, the nuclear accident

at Chernobyl did not cause a major increase in 90Sr activity in environmental samples in Croatia,

contrary to radioactive isotopes of caesium. For example, in May 1986 in the Zagreb area  137Cs

surface deposit was 6200 Bq m-2. 

The increased 90Sr fallout activity concentrations were recorded mainly in May 1986, leading

to the surface deposit of 211.3 Bq m-2 in Zagreb area (Franic 1994). In 1987, the 90Sr fallout activity

concentrations  dropped  to  12.7  Bq  m-2,  i.e.,  the  pre-Chernobyl  value,  while  137Cs  activity

concentrations remained elevated. The 137Cs:90Sr activity ratio that for the pre-Chernobyl period in

most of the environmental samples collected in Croatia was relatively constant, generally ranging

between values 1 and 3, after the Chernobyl accident was notably altered (Popovic 1963-1978;

Bauman et. al. 1979-1992). In 1986, this ratio for milk had a value of 107 and similar ratio values

were determined in most of the other environmental samples in Croatia.

Milk

The data for the measurements of radiostrontium activities in milk and fallout (1961 - 2001) are

presented on figures 2 and 3.  The peak value of 90Sr in milk, 1.42 ± 0.17 Bq L-1, was recorded in

1964, after the most intensive nuclear weapon tests. As in the case of fallout, 90Sr levels in milk were

exponentially decreasing from 1964 to 1986, when the Chernobyl accident caused a 90Sr activity

concentration peak of 0.43  ± 0.41 Bq L-1. The high standard deviation in year 1986 was caused by

very high activity concentrations in May and June, being 1.52 and 1.00 Bq L-1 respectively.  After

the  Chernobyl  accident,  the  90Sr  activity  concentrations  in  milk  very  quickly  decreased  to

5

pre-Chernobyl values, the activity concentration in 1987 being 0.17  ± 0.18 Bq L-1. For comparison,

in 1985, the recorded activity concentration was 0.16 ± 0.02 Bq L-1. For the overall observed period,

the lowest 90Sr milk activity concentration was recorded in 2000, being 0.06 ± 0.02 Bq L-1, while in

2001 it was 0.07 ± 0.03 Bq L-1. 

By regression analysis it can be demonstrated that the 90Sr fallout activity concentrations are

related to milk activity concentrations, the coefficient of correlation being 0.80. Therefore, from

fallout data 90Sr activity concentrations in milk can be very simply modeled as:

where:

Amilk(t)

Afallout(t)

is the 90Sr activity concentration in milk in Bq L-1 and

is the 90Sr fallout activity concentration in Bq m-2.

The data on 90Sr in milk, fallout and model (1) are shown on Figure 2. This simple regression

systematically underestimates observed milk data in 1960s and 1970s, and overestimates afterwards.

Figure 2. about here

90Sr transfer from fallout to milk

To  assess  the  90Sr  transfer  from  fallout  to  milk  the  mathematical  model  for  food  products

recommended by UNSCEAR (UNSCEAR 1982) was applied. This model was previously tested on

milk samples collected in Croatia (Lokobauer 1984). The function has the following form:

where:

Ak(t)

Uk(i)

Σe-µm...

Bq L-1,

is the activity concentration of radionuclide k in food (milk), the unit for Ak(t) being

is the fallout deposition rate of radionuclide k in a year i (Bq m-2 y-1),

is the cumulative fallout deposit for radionuclide  k as the result of deposition in

µ-1

is the effective (i.e., observed) mean residence time of available 90Sr in soil,

b1, b2, b3

are the factors which can be derived from reported data by regression analysis. The

previous years (Bq m-2 y-1),

unit is Bq L-1 / (Bq m-2 y-1).

The  equation  (2)  assumes  the  chain  model  for  the  transfer  of  radionuclides  between

environmental compartments (C0 ...C5), linking the input to the atmosphere to the dose in man:

The physical meaning of terms in model (2) is as follows: the first term (rate factor) describes direct

deposition and transfer, the second term (lag factor) describes contamination through fallout from

7

previous year, and the third term (soil factor) reflects the contamination from fallout deposition

accumulated from all preceding years, the exponential describing the combined physical decay and

any other decrease in availability of considered radionuclide due to various other processes (like

penetration in deeper soil layers, dilution etc.).

Regression analysis gives for the factors b1, b2 and b3 values 1.00 × 10-4, 9.00 × 10-5 and

1.23  ×  10-3  Bq  L-1  /  (Bq  m-2  y-1)  respectively,  and  for  the  constant  µ  the  value  of  0.43  y-1,  the

coefficient of correlation between actual data and data predicted by model (2) being 0.77. Compared

with the simple regression model given by equation (1) it is just slightly lesser. However, model (2)

has physical meaning, contrary to model (1) which just demonstrates that the milk activity is the

temporal function of fallout activity. The reciprocal value of the constant µ, 2.3 y, is the effective

mean residence time of available 90Sr in soil. However, to find the real residence time, µR, constant

µ should be corrected for the radioactive decay. Therefore:

where ln(2)/m = 29.1 y is the half-life of 90Sr.

From equation (3), the real mean residence time for 90Sr in soil (TM = 1/µR), was found to be

2.5 y, which is just slightly higher than effective mean residence time. Mean residence time of 2.5 y

is much smaller from the value for the northern hemisphere found in literature.  Namely, on the

northern hemisphere, the average value for the factor µ is 0.12 y-1 (WHO 1983), which means that

the effective mean residence time and the real mean residence time of available 90Sr have respective

values of 8.3 y and 10.4 y. However, it should be noted that residence time of available 90Sr in soil,

varies for individual foods and soil conditions (WHO 1983),  and in some cases can be several times

smaller than the northern hemisphere average.

The effective mean residence time for 90Sr can be found by fitting the milk data to a simple

exponential function:

8

The effective mean residence time based on the reciprocal value of constant b resulting from

the fit, equals 10.7 years. By correcting for the radioactive decay using equation analog to (3), for

the real 90Sr mean residence time in milk is obtained 14.6 years, which is nearly 6 times longer than

for the mean residence time for 90Sr in soil calculated by model (2). It should be noted that the mean

residence time in milk, estimated that way, is only an indicator of the rate by which the availability

of 90Sr decreases with time and is not related to the metabolic behavior of strontium in cows.  The

90Sr activity concentrations in milk and the fit obtained by equation (2) are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. about here

The  transfer  between  successive  steps  in  the  pathway  chains  is  described  by  transfer

coefficients,  which  relate  infinite  time  integrals  of  activity  concentration  in  the  relevant

compartments. Thus, P23, the transfer coefficient from fallout deposition (compartment 2) to diet

(compartment 3) is given by the following equation:

where:

Ak(t)

Uk(t)

is the activity concentration of radionuclide k in food, i.e., milk (BqL-1) and

is the fallout deposition rate of radionuclide (Bqm-2y-1).

9

Using values of Ak(t) and Uk(t) assessed on the yearly basis, the integration can be replaced

by a summation. The combination of equations (2) and (5) leads to:

P23 for  90Sr in milk was assessed to be 2.5 × 10-3 Bq y L-1/(Bq m-2). That means that with each

Becquerel deposited by fallout on an area of 1 m2 of soil, the activity concentration of 1 L of milk

increases by 2.5 × 10-3 Bq. For comparison, the transfer coefficient P23 for total diet was estimated

to be 4 × 10-3 Bq y kg-1/(Bqm-2) (UNSCEAR 1982).

Doses incurred by milk consumption

In the Republic of Croatia (4.4 millions inhabitants) consumption of milk, is approximately 87 L per

year per every person (CBS 2001; CBS 2002). However, if all the dairy products are taken into

account, than the effective consumption of milk significantly increases (CBS 2001; CBS 2002;

Kolega 1994, Colic-Baric 2001, Colic-Baric et al. 2001; Colic-Baric and Brlecic 2001). Therefore,

the consumption of milk and diary products can potentially lead to significant radiation doses. The

effective dose (Sv) incurred due to milk consumption over a set period depends on the activity of

radionuclides  that  are  present  in  milk  and  on  the  quantity  of  milk  consumed.  The  dose  can  be

expressed as:

where:

E

C

is the total effective dose in Sv,

total annual per caput consumption of milk, 

10

Dcf(k)

the dose conversion factor for radionuclide k and

Ak

the mean activity concentration of radionuclide k in milk (Bq L-1).

For equal time increments of one month, integral from equation (7) can be replaced by the

respective sums of average monthly activity concentrations. Dcf(k), the committed effective dose per

unit intake (the dose conversion factor), relates the ingested activity concentration to the effective

dose  to  the  whole  body.  Calculated  doses  due  to  90Sr  in  milk  for  the  peak  year  (1964),  pre-

Chernobyl, Chernobyl, post Chernobyl year and year 2001 for various ages are presented in Table

1. For the dose conversion factors were taken ICRP values (IAEA 1996). The statistical data on milk

consumption for different age groups were taken from the literature (Kolega 1994, Colic-Baric 2001,

Colic-Baric et al. 2001; Colic-Baric and Brlecic 2001).

Table 1. about here

The total dose due to 90Sr in 2001 for adult was approximately 0.27 µSv. For comparison,

in the same year the dose due to 137Cs was just slightly less 0.24 µSv,  the effective dose per unit

input for 137Cs being 1.3 × 10-8 Sv Bq-1 (IAEA 1996). The annual dose received by 90Sr intake via

food in the mid 1990s was estimated to be about 3 µSv in Croatia (Lokobauer et al. 1998).

Using doses from table 1 and data on age distribution of Croatian population (CBS 2002),

and assuming similar radiostrontium milk activity concentrations in other Croatian regions, the

collective effective dose for Croatian population due to 90Sr ingestion by milk consumption in year

2001 can be estimated to be 2.0 man-Sv, while the annual collective dose in the year of Chernobyl

was  13.0  man-Sv.  The  same  year  (1986),  the  collective  effective  dose  for  Croatian  population

incurred from milk due to 134Cs and 137Cs was estimated to be about 200 man-Sv, 59% of which was

attributed to 137Cs and rest to 134Cs (Franic et al. 1998).

CONCLUSIONS

weapon tests.

The 90Sr activity in milk decreases exponentially since 1960s, after the intensive atmospheric nuclear

weapon test stopped. Peak values were recorded in 1964, following the most intensive nuclear

Doses  due  to  radiostrontium  from  milk  consumption  are  small,  in  spite  of  considerable

consumption  of  milk  by  the  Croatian  population.  The  collective  effective  dose  to  Croatian

population in 2001 from 90Sr ingestion of milk was 2.0 man-Sv.

It  should  be  noted  that  although  radiocaesium  levels  in  the  environment  in  the  year  of

Chernobyl accident were much higher than those of radiostrontium in the following years the doses

that Croatian population received from  137Cs and 90Sr were approximately the same. This can be

explained by fact that 90Sr transfer from soil to the food chain is considerably more efficient, than

for 137Cs.

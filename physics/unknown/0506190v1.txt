Abstract. The claim that molecule H-antiH be unstable cannot be a proof since it is based on a premise, which contradicts the proof. 
This is illustrated with four examples. 
 
The  premise  for  claim  [1]  is  that  with  pure  Coulomb 
forces no bound state of hydrogen-antihydrogen exists, a pre-
mise never proved [2-3]. Disregarding pure Coulomb 
forces for HH is dangerous as their main energy ef-
fects are on the field axis. Discussing HH exclusively 
with (Jacobi) masses [1] is also dangerous, as mass is 
connected with charge-separation. We discuss four 
pure Coulomb effects to invalidate [1]. 
(i) Atom hydrogen-antihydrogen difference. With relatively 
accurate  Bohr  theory,  energies  of  left-  and  right-
handed atoms are degenerate since pure Coulomb forces 
are identical for e1e2 (H) and e2e1 (H). For Bohr, a 
distinction  is  purely  conventional,  meaning  that  Bohr 
theory is achiral. It would then have been normal to 
interpret the small errors of achiral Bohr theory as 
signatures for chiral behavior, a common sense solu-
tion never considered. But in sophisticated bound 
state  QED,  errors  of  achiral  Bohr  theory  are  explained 
with  a  quartic,  which  is  very  suspicious. A quartic for a 
neutral 2-fermion system directly points to its chiral 
behavior  [4].  Or,  the  observed  quartic  proves  that  natural 
anti-hydrogen exists [4], contradicting [1]. 
(ii)  Hydrogen-antihydrogen  interaction.  Pure  Coulomb  ef-
fects on 4-fermion system stability must be assessed 
unambiguously before validating [1]. The HH non-
relativistic  10  term  Hamiltonian  H+=  H0+∆H  has 
atomic  threshold  H0  and  perturbation  +∆H,  con-
sisting  of  4  pure  Coulomb  terms.  HH  charge-conjugated 
Hamiltonian  H-=  H0-∆H  suggests  –without  proof- 
that  anti-symmetrical  HH  states  are  repulsive,  if 
only attractive symmetrical HH states give stable system 
H2.  Mutually  exclusive  H±  =H0±∆H  contradict  the 
convention  that  stable  H2  is  charge-symmetrical  HH. 
It can be proved theoretically and experimentally [5] 
that  stable  H2  is  charge-anti-symmetrical  HH.  Errors 
with  symmetries  for H and H2 disprove claim [1], 
as both H and HH exist in nature and both are stable [4-
5]. These arguments suffice to flaw [1] but neglec-
ting pure Coulomb effects [1] has more consequences. 
(iii)  Hydrogen-antihydrogen  oscillations  [6].  The  energy 
difference δ between states HH and HH in (ii) is  
δ= H0-∆H–(H0 +∆H)=-2∆H 
a pure static Coulomb effect completely neglected in [1]. 
H-H oscillations hν must obey pure Coulomb quantum 
gap δ if hν=δ. Scaling gap δ gives 
δ’=δ/(e2/r0)=-2r0(-1/rbA–1/raB+1/rab+1/rAB). 
With rAB=R, raA=rbB =r0=0,5291 Å and a 4-fermion 
model  with  leptons  rotating  in  phase  in  a  plane,  perpen-
dicular to R, gives simply 
δ’=δ/(e2/r0)=-4(0,5291/R)[1-(1+(0,5291/R)2)-½] 
 

 
. 
     Fig. 1 δ’ vs u’ (δ’=1,0667u’-0,0103; fit R2=0,9945) 
The H2 potential energy curve [7] gives observed long-
range behavior, if scaled energies u’ =U’(R)/e2/r0 are 
used  for  9  turning  points  below  the  threshold  at 
the attractive branch. The perfect linear plot δ’ vs 
u’ in Fig. 1 immediately probes H-H oscillations of 
type hν=δ. Pure Coulomb effects, completely neglected 
in [1], can even solve the difficult problem with H-
H  oscillations,  if  not  B-L  symmetry  breaking  [6]. 
With H forbidden in nature, oscillation times are 1020 
sec [6]. With natural H, this is 10-15 sec, a common 
sense but large discrepancy of 1035!  
(iv) Matter-antimatter asymmetry [9]. Pure Coulomb effects 
in  (i-iii),  unjustly  disregarded  [1],  are  also  needed  for 
this  physical/cosmological  problem  [9].  From  the 
quartic in (i) it is obvious that matter H is different 
from  antimatter  H.  But  with  (ii)-(iii)  it  is  evident 
that amounts of matter H and antimatter H in stable 
HH or H2 must be equal for classical stochiometric reasons. 
Since hydrogen is the most abundant species in the Universe, 
this problem is removed.  
Claim [1], inspired by H-experiments [10-11], cannot 
be a proof as it is based on a wrong premise, which, by pure 
logic, contradicts [1].

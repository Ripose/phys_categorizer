The Final Three Meters in the ILC – Can the Beam Approach 5 nm?

Fermilab, August 2006 

 
It is known that while the cost of the ILC is determined by the beam energy, its technical 
challenge  comes  from  the  luminosity.  Compared  with  the  SLC,  the  increase  in  beam 
energy is a factor of 5 (from 50 to 250 GeV), but in luminosity, a factor of 10,000 (from 
1030 to 1034 cm−2s−1). To reach such a high luminosity, one must make the beam size very 
small at the IP (σy = 5 nm). The question is: Can a dense charged particle beam be made 
so tiny? This memo gives a quantitative analysis of the space charge force, which would 
ultimately determine the smallest beam size that could be obtained. 
 
The ILC final focusing and beam envelope are shown in Figure 1. The vertical beam size 
σy  would  be  reduced  by  a  factor  of  20,000  (from  100  μm  to  5  nm)  in  the  final  three 
meters before the beam reaches the IP.

The  electric  and  magnetic  space  charge  forces  of  the  electron  (or  positron)  beam  are 
strong. Due to opposite direction of the two forces, the total space charge force e × [E + 
(v × B)] would have nearly perfect cancellation (1 – β2 = 1/γ2) at high energy. However, 
this is only possible if the beam has zero emittance (i.e., no divergence). The ILC beam 
divergences are respectively, σx’ = 31.2 μrad, σy’ = 14.3 μrad. Thus, for example, in the 
Y direction there would be 1.43 × 10−5 part of the Coulomb force (e × E) that would not

be  compensated.  This  residual  force  could  still  be  large  compared  to  the  external 
magnetic focusing force. The following is a quantitative comparison. 
 
We will use two known results: 

1)  The space charge electric field of a 2-D ellipse and a 3-D ellipsoid with uniform 

charge distribution can be found in Refs. [1-6]. 

2)  We are interested in beam envelope, which is determined by the second moment 
and  not  by  the  charge  distribution  [7].  Therefore,  a  3-D  ellipsoid  beam  with 
Gaussian distribution of rms size (σx, σy, σz) can be replaced by an ellipsoid with 
uniform  distribution  of  size  (5σx,  5σy,  5σz)  since  both  have  the  same  second 
moment. 

 

Because the longitudinal size of the ILC beam is much larger than the transverse one, we 
may simplify our calculation to a 2-D ellipse, which has uniform charge distribution and 
the  size  of  (4σx,  4σy).  (Note:  This  gives  the  same  second  moment  as  an  elliptical 
Gaussian  beam  in  2-D.)  Let  a  and  b  be  the  semi-axis  of  the  ellipse.  The  electric  field 
inside and outside is shown in Figure 2 and can be expressed as:

in which λ is the line density and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. Similar expressions are 
for  Ey  with  a  and  b  interchanged  and  x  replaced  by  y.  (When  x  ≥  a  and  y  ≠  0,  the 
expression is more complicated but of no interest to this memo.)

(It is interesting to note that this force is about 1/10 in magnitude of the bonding force 
between the electron and proton in a hydrogen atom.) As noted above, most of this force 
will be cancelled by the space charge magnetic force. The cancellation, however, won’t 
be perfect due to finite beam emittance. The residual force can be estimated as:

This defocusing force should be compared to the external focusing force from the final 
doublet, of which the parameters are listed in Table 1.

The final vertical focusing mainly comes from QD. The beam envelope shown in Figure 
1 assumes the final three meters are a free space (i.e., no focusing or defocusing force). 
However, this is not true and we already know the magnitude of the defocusing force. For 
the  sake  of  comparison,  we  assume  the  external  magnetic  field  was  still  there  and  can 
calculate the corresponding focusing force as follows:

It is seen that the defocusing force is three orders of magnitude larger than the focusing 
force. This brings up a problem – Even if the design emittance could be achieved (which 
is hard), we may still be unable to squeeze the beam to the design size at the IP because 
of the presence of a strong defocusing force in the final three meters.

Appendix 1 – ILC Beam Volume Density: 
 
Another  way  to  look  at  the  difficulty  for  the  ILC  beam  to  reach  the  design  size  is  to 
calculate the particle volume density. Table 2 lists the beam size and density for the ILC, 
SLC, FFTB and ATF, respectively.

The  particle  volume  density  in  the  ILC  is  so  high  that  if  we  compare  it  with  ordinary 
materials in the rest frame, it is three orders of magnitude higher than the ideal gas and 
even higher than some solid, e.g., potassium, as shown in Table 3.

In reality, the situation is even more severe. While the particle distribution in gases and 
solids in the three dimensions is uniform, it is highly uneven in the ILC beam. The aspect 
ratio is Y: X: Z = 1: 115: 52450. The particles are much denser in the Y direction than in 
the  other  two  directions.  To  estimate  how  dense  it  is,  let  us  draw  a  box  near  the  peak 
density point with the size Y × X × Z = 1 Å × 115 Å × 52450 Å. The number of particles 
in this box would be approximately 1.1 × 105, or 48 particles in each direction. In other 
words, there would be 48 electrons (or positrons) within 1 Å (the size of an atom) in the 
Y  direction.  (In  the  SLC  case,  the  same  procedure  leads  to  0.47  electrons  or  positrons 
within 1 Å in the Y direction, which is 100 times less than in the ILC.) 
 
These densely populated particles result in an enormous space charge force, which, even 
after the relativistic cancellation, remains much larger than the external focusing force as 
demonstrated in the text.

A  modification  for  the  ILC  beam  in  the  final  three  meters  is  to  replace  1/γ2  in  the 
expression of K by ax’ and ay’, respectively:

In most cases when the space charge is of interest, γ is low and the beam divergence is 
much  smaller  than  1/γ2.  As  a  result,  the  residual  space  charge  force  from  the  beam 
divergence can be ignored.  However, the ILC is a special case. The beam divergence is 
much larger than 1/γ2 and the modification is necessary.

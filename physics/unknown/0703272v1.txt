    Whether the high temperature superconductivity is originated from the non-phonon mechanism or from 
the  phonon  mechanism  has  been  a  debating  topic  since  the  discovery  of  cuprate  superconductors.  Many 
nonphononic mechanism were presented, for instance, P. W. Anderson gave his RVB model in 19871 and 
Schrieffer  et  al.  their  spin  bag  model  in19882.  Some  other  spin  polaronic  theories  were  also  presented 
around  same  time3.  Other  proposed  nonphononic  mechanisms  are  excitonic  models  4,5,6,7,8,9  and 
antiferromagnetic  spin  fluctuation  based  mechanisms10,11,12,13,14.  Importance  of  anhormonic  phonons  was 
stressed  for  phonon  based  mechanisms15,16    and  concept  of  bipolaronic  superconductivity  used  for  high- 
Tc systems17,18,19,20,21,22,23. Various forms of generalised BCS theory were also developed24,25,26. The focus 
of all these theories has been on the role phonons and strong correlations play in the superconductors. In 
this letter, we will find that most properties of cuprate superconductors can be understood with a diagram 
related  to  high-Tc  mechanism.  A  short  and  simple  explanation  is  given  through  giving  new  ideas  in  this 
letter.   
 

The properties of cuprate superconductors are related to the 2D feature of the electron or hole systems in 
CuO2 planes, and more closely related to the strong correlation feature of the systems. The spectral weight 
transfer, the phase separation, the van Hove singularity and two states of electrons were attributed to the 
strong  correlation  effects  by  authors,  and  many  of  the  relation  between  various  properties  or  physics 
including high-Tc mechanism were described in literatures. Some of them are correct, but some should be 
corrected in my ideas.   

One of my ideas is the so-called ‘attraction v. repulsion areas in wave vector space’27, which should be 
the  main  cause  for  non-s  wave  pairing,  Fermi  arcs  and  nodal  metal  properties.  The  mechanisms  of  the 
in-gap states and the spectral weight transfers have been discussed by many authors, but the possible effects 
are riddles. In my viewpoint, the in-gap states and the spectral weight transfers are the most important and 
necessary  condition  forming  the  pre-pairing  in  the  pseudogap  region  of  superconductors.  This  will  be 
discussed below.

In  our  previous  papers28,  we  suggested  that  the  van  Hove  singularity  influence  the  role  phonons  and 
strong  correlations  play  in  cuprate  superconductors.  However,  though  we  believe  the  effects  of  the 
singularity  on  the  properties  of  materials,  I  find  that  some  properties  of 
superconductors  are  dominated  by  the  electron  structures,  and  this  may  be  an 
interesting  problem  for  many  physicists,  but  one  did  not  find  their  details.  In 
undoped  and extremely  lightly  doped  region,  the  number  of  electrons/holes  in 
Fermi  surface  is  too  little,  the  scatter  occurs  between  p-band  and  d-band,  the 
energies exchanged between electrons should be larger, ~1eV, but the energies 
of phonons are small, so the media between electrons are photons. That is to say, 
the electron-electron interactions will dominate the properties of the materials, 
so  the  effects  of  phonons  are  negligible.  In  lightly-  and  under-doped  region,  the  d-holes  and  p-holes  in

in-gap states around Fermi surface form the so-called d-p pairs, the life times of which are too short to form 
the superconductivity. Contrasting with these cases, in optimally doped region, the low frequency phonons 
may mediate the holes of in-gap states (around Fermi surface) for p-type cuprate superconductors, so the 
low frequency acoustic phonons (cooperating with van Hove singularity of electron states) will dominate 
the physics of the cuprates, lead to the T-linear resistivity, the nodal metal features, the superconductivities 
and  the  unusual  isotope  effects  on  Tc.  For  the  over-doped  superconductors,  the  roles  of  electron-electron 
interaction  on  the  properties  of  superconductors  may  be  enhanced,  and  this  can  be  shown  on  the  “Fermi 
liquid behavior” of the electron systems.

These discussed above are shown in Fig.2, which is based on the phonon mediated high temperature 
superconductivity.  The  pairs  are  not  originated  from  the  magnetism,  and  these  ideas  are  against  many 
authors.  Various  excitations  of  the  antiferromagnetism  from  d-holes  form  the  background  of  non-Fermi 
liquid29, lead the carriers to be scattered by the non-Fermi liquid besides phonons.   

Particularly,  the  relations  shown  in  Fig.2  are  only  some  important  examples  in  my  information.  For 
example, the pre-pairing not only results in the topics listed in Fig.1, but also affects the transport of both 
spins and charges. In addition, some behaviors may be from many causes, and some causes are not listed in 

Fig.2. For instance, the unusual isotope effects are not only from 

, the pairing temperature larger

than the superconducting temperature (phonons should affect directly on 

*T , instead directly on 

cT ), but 

also  related  to  both  the  van  Hove  singularity  and  the  dominating  role  of  low  frequency  phonons.  The 
high-Tc needs the van Hove singularity, and needs the strong electron-phonon interaction.

Abstract

          It  was  demonstrated  (gr-qc/9910036)  that  the  gravitational  and  inertial
masses are correlated by  an adimensional factor, which depends on the incident ( or
emitted)radiation upon the particle. There is a direct correlation between the radiation
absorbed( or radiated) by the particle and its gravitational mass, independently of the
inertial mass. Only in the absence of electromagnetic radiation the mentioned factor
becomes equal  to  one. On  the other  hand,  in  specific  electromagnetic  conditions,  it
can be reduced,  nullified  or made   negative. This means that there is the possibility
of the gravitational masses can be reduced, nullified or made negative by means of
electromagnetic radiation. This unexpected theoretical result  was  confirmed  by  an
experiment  using  Extra-Low  Frequency(ELF)  radiation    on  ferromagnetic  material
(gr-qc/0005107).  Recently  another  experiment  using  UV  light  on  phosphorescent
plastic have confirmed  the phenomenon. We present a complete explanation for the
alterations  of  the  gravitational  field  in  photoluminescent    materials.  This  work
indicates  that  the  alterations  of  the  gravitational  field  can  be  sufficiently  strong  to
invert  the gravity on photoluminescent materials with very high refractive indices.

Introduction

          It  is  known  that  the  physical
two  distinct
property  of  mass  has 
aspects,  gravitational  mass  mg  and
inertial  mass  mi  .  Gravitational  mass
produces and responds to gravitational
fields.  It  supplies  the  mass  factors  in
Newton's  famous  inverse-square  law
2).  Inertial
of  gravity(F12=Gmg1mg2  /r12
mass  is  the  mass  factor  in  Newton's
2nd Law of Motion (F=mia).
          In  a  previous  paper1  we  have
shown  that  the  gravitational  mass  and
the  inertial  mass  are  correlated  by  an
adimensional    factor,  which  depends
on  the  incident  radiation  upon  the
particle.  It  was  shown  that  only  in  the
absence  of  electromagnetic  radiation

in 

specific 

this  factor  becomes  equal  to  1  and
electromagnetic
that, 
conditions, it can be reduced,  nullified
or made   negative.

      We  have  built  a  system  (called
System  G)  to  verify  the  effects  of  the
ELF radiation on the gravitational mass
of    a  body  .  In  the  system  G,  a  60Hz
frequency    radiation  was  produced  by
an  ELF  antenna.  A 
layer  of
annealed pure iron around the antenna
(  toroid  form  )  have  absorbed  all  the
ELF radiation.

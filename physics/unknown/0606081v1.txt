ABSTRACT 

 
Far  field  radiation  pattern  under  tight  focusing  condition  is  investigated  in  Coherent  Anti-stokes  Raman  Scattering 
(CARS) microscopy both in the forward (F-CARS) and backward (E-CARS) directions. While we assume no refraction 
index mismatch between the sample and the environing medium, our rigorous numerical electromagnetic computation 
takes into account the exact polarizations of the excitation laser beams and of the induced nonlinear dipoles. F-CARS 
and E-CARS radiation patterns, as well as their divergence, are studied as a function of the size of the sample object and 
compared to the excitation beams. 
 
Keywords: CARS microscopy, non linear microscopy, radiation pattern, focus beams, electromagnetic modeling 
 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

 
Coherent  Anti-Stokes  Resonant  Scattering  (CARS)  microscopy  represents  a  unique  approach  to  image  chemical  and 
biological samples using molecular vibrations as a contrast mechanism. CARS is a four-wave mixing nonlinear process1 
in  which  two  laser  fields  of  pulsations  ωp  (pump)  and  ωs  (Stokes)  interact  with  a  medium  to  generate  a  field  at  the 
pulsation ωas=2ωp-ωs (anti-Stokes). This field is dramatically enhanced when the pulsation difference ωp-ωs equals the 
pulsation of a molecular vibration in the medium. First implemented in microscopy by Zumbusch2 under tight focusing 
condition  and  collinearly  propagating  pump  and  Stokes  beams,  CARS  microscopy  appears  nowadays  as  a  powerful 
contrast  mechanism  to  study  living  matter  with  chemical  selectivity,  reduced  photodamage  and  three-dimensional 
sectioning capability3. 
Because  of  the  coherent  nature  of  the  CARS  contrast,  the  image  formation  process  relies  on  multiple  interferences 
between  the  elementary  non  linear  dipoles  that  are  photo-induced  into  the  sample.  This  is  very  different  from 
fluorescence microscopy where no interferences take place due to the incoherent nature of the fluorescence emission. 
The  CARS  coherent  emission,  that  occurs  where  the  excitation  beams  (ωp  and  ωs)  are  focused  and  overlap,  is  also 
responsible for the asymmetric CARS emission in forward (F-CARS) and backward directions (E-CARS)4.  
Electromagnetic  modelling  of  the  CARS  emission  process  under  tight  focusing  condition  have  been  reported5  in  the 
framework of a Green analysis and have focused mainly on the field in the direct space (x,y,z) and in the very vicinity 
of  the  object.  In  this  paper  we  pursue  an  alternative  way  describing  the  CARS  far  field  emission  as  an  ensemble  of 
coherently induced Hertzian dipoles located inside the object. This approach permits to compute the radiated anti-Stokes 
field (ωas) both in the direct (x,y,z) and in the reciprocal space (kx, ky, kz). This model allows us to revisit the far field 
radiation patterns of beads with various diameters both in the forward and backward directions. Moreover, for the first 
time these patterns are presented in the k space. Eventually, the directivity of the CARS emission is compared with the 
incident beam’s. 
 

2.  THEORY 
 
We have implemented a full vector electromagnetic model6 of both the focused incident fields and the emitted CARS 
radiation in a 3D object. A collinear geometry, where the pump and the Stokes beams overlap and focus through the 
same objective lens, is considered. This objective lens is assumed to be an achromatic thin lens.

Both  laser  beams  (pump  and  Stokes)  are  assumed  to  be  Gaussian,  monochromatic  and  linearly  polarized  along  the  x 
axis. The divergence of the laser beams can be neglected so that, in a plane before the objective (see fig. 1), the electric 
field Ei is given by

where f is the focal length of the objective. Introducing the ratio7 β of the objective back-aperture (r) to the beam radius 
(σg) proposed by Hess et al. (β=r/σg), Ei can be written

where r is the distance between the dipole and the point M, (er,eθ,eφ) is the dipole spherical base (see Fig. 2) and kas 
is the wave number of the anti-Stokes radiation (kas=ωas/c). Therefore, the illuminated sample object is considered 
as  an  assembly  of  coherent  dipoles  which  polarization  only  depends  on  the  position  of  the  dipole  (see  Eq.  10). 
Thus, the total field emitted by the object can be calculated at each point of the object space. It is the sum of fields 
emitted by each dipole (see Eq. 11).

3. FAR FIED RADIATION PATTERN OF BEADS 

 
We consider beads of various diameters embedded in a uniform medium of refractive index n=1.33 (water). The beads 
and  the  surrounding  medium  are  assumed  to  have  the  same  refractive  index  (no  refractive  effects)  and  to  be  non 
dispersive. The polarizations of the incoming beams (prior focusing) are considered linear along the x axis (Eq. 1). The 
incoming  beams  are  focused  in  the  bead  center,  the  pump  and  Stokes  beam  have  a  wavelength  of  λp=750nm  and 
λs=825nm respectively. The numerical aperture (NA) of the focusing lens is set to 1.2. With these values, the waists of 
the pump and Stokes beams along the x axis are 280nm and 300nm respectively. 

3.1.  Far field intensity in the direct space 
Fig. 3 presents the far field intensity radiation patterns in the (x,z) plane of beads with various diameters d (100nm to 
2µm), the color scale is not comparable between different diameters (see Fig. 4 for comparison). As already reported in 
Reference  4  the  radiation  pattern  is  dipole  like  for  beads  with  a  diameter  much  smaller  than  λp  (d=100nm)  and  the 
amount  of  radiated  energy  is  similar  in  both  forward  (F-CARS)  and  backward  (E-CARS)  directions.  This  symmetry 
breaks down for larger bead diameters (d>200nm) and the F-CARS signal becomes rapidly much stronger than the E-
CARS  signal  due  to  constructive  interferences  in  the  forward  direction.  As  it  is  now  well  known,  this  effect  as  the 
practical consequence that CARS scatterers much smaller than λp can be observed in the backward direction whereas 
CARS scatterers larger than λp are easily observed in the forward direction. 
Let us consider now the emission in the k space to appreciate the divergence of the emitted radiation.

comparable between different diameters. The pump and Stokes beams propagate along the z axis, they are focused at the bead center, 
polarized along the x axis (before focusing) and exhibit a waist along the x axis of 280nm and 300nm respectively. 

 

 

3.2. Far field intensity in the reciprocal space 

Fig. 4 gives the far field intensity radiation patterns in the (kx,ky) space for beads of different diameters. The unit are in 
kx/k0 and ky/k0 where k0=2π/λAS and λAS the anti-Stokes wavelength in vacuum. The color scales are different on each 
figure but can be compared thanks to the associated scales. For each diameter both the F-CARS and E-CARS radiation 
patterns are given; on the same figure, and for direct comparison, we have displayed the pump and Stokes beams in the 
k space (for this specific figure, the color scale is not comparable to the other CARS figures). 
For a bead diameter d=100nm, one can recognize the intensity radiation pattern of a dipole lying along the x axis, the 
cone of emission being very broad along the y axis (ky/k0 reaches 1.2, a value much larger than the excitation beams). 
As already mentioned in Fig. 3., the emitted power in F-CARS and E-CARS are similar. When d≥500nm the E-CARS 
emission becomes negligible as compared to the F-CARS emission although subtle interference effects create some hot 
spots in the E-CARS k space. When d>500nm the radiation pattern extension along the ky axis reduces progressively to 
reach the value comparable to that of the excitation beams (case of the d=2µm bead). On the contrary, along the kx axis 
the divergence remains similar to the small diameter case.  
This  effect  can  be  physically  understood  considering  the  CARS  emission  as  a  spatial  transformation  in  the  k  space 
between the incident fields and a dipole emission. For a small bead diameter, one recovers the dipole emission with a 
‘narrow’ divergence along the kx axis and a large one along the ky axis. For larger diameters, the similar phases of the 
induced dipoles along the y axis ruled out the dipole like radiation pattern along this axis and concentrate the radiation 
to recover ultimately the divergence of the excitation beams along this ky axis. Ultimately (bead of diameter d=2µm) 
this process generates a beam which has the divergence of the dipole emission along the kx axis (and therefore smaller 
than  the  excitation  beams)  and  a  divergence  similar  to  the  excitation  beams  along  the  ky  axis.  All  in  all,  the  CARS 
process is able to generate (for large diameter) a F-CARS beam which has a lower divergence than the excitation beams.  
From  a  practical  point  of  view  it  is  possible  to  use  a  low  NA  lens  (see  next  section)  to  collect  most  of  the  F-CARS 
emitted  radiation  coming  from  objects  bigger  than  few λp.  Let  us  investigate  more  quantitatively  this  property  in  the 
next section.

and ky/k0 (k0=2π/λAS). The color scales are different on each figure but can be compared thanks to the associated scales.  
Inset: Pump and Stokes beams in the k space (scale not comparable to the other CARS figures). 

3.3. F-CARS total radiated intensity 

From the F-CARS intensity radiation patterns (Fig. 4.), it is possible to compute the amount of energy collected by a 
lens whose numerical aperture is NAF. In the considered collinear geometry this lens is used only for the F-CARS signal 
collection.  Fig.  5  plots  the  amount  of  F-CARS  collected  power  for  beads  of  different  diameters  with  NAF.  We  have 
normalized to 1 the total energy emitted for each bead in a NAF=1.2. On the same graph, and for comparison, we have 
plotted the curve of the excitation pump and Stokes beams. The feature addressed in the previous section concerning the 
energy concentration in the k space for large bead diameter is clearly visible.  For beads with diameter d≥500nm, the 
curve are all above the ‘excitation beams’ curve telling that a specific fraction of the total emitted F-CARS radiation can 
be  collected  with  a  lower  NAF  than  for  the  ‘excitation  beams’.  Ultimately  the  total  F-CARS  emitted  radiation  of  the 
d=2µm  bead  can  be  collected  with  NAF=0.85,  a  value  much  smaller  than  the  NA=1.2  of  the  focusing  objective  lens. 
Practically it has been suggested9 to use the condenser lens (NAF ~0.5) of a conventional inverted microscope to collect 
the F-CARS emitted signal. From our computations such a NAF leads to a 60% collection efficiency for objects bigger 
than 2.5λp (2µm), a value viable considering the strong F-CARS signal generated by such big objects.

4.  CONCLUSION 

 
In this paper we have presented a rigorous electromagnetic modeling of CARS emission, considering both the excitation 
pump and Stokes fields and the CARS emission in a 3D object as vectorial. The presented model considers the objects 
as  an  ensemble  of  Hertzian  dipoles  photo-induced  through  the  third  order  CARS  non  linear  process.  From  such  a 
description we have computed the far field CARS radiation pattern in both the forward and the backward directions for 
beads of different diameters. Our analysis in the k space has revealed how the CARS process can generate a F-CARS 
beam  with  a  smaller  divergence  than  the  excitation  beams.  This  surprising  effect  relies  on  the  coherent  constructive 
interference which takes place between the induced dipoles for bead diameter larger than few λp. In practice, such an 
effect permits to use low NA lens to collect most of the F-CARS emitted radiation.

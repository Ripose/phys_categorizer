ABSTRACT    1H  RAMPS  solid  state  NMR  and  13C  CP/MAS  spectra  of  D-  and  L-  alanine 

crystals  were  measured  at  temperature  ranging  from  220K  to  295K.  Some  major  points  are  as 

follows:  (1)  α-H  and  protons  in  the  methyl  group  showed  a  spin-spin  coupling  effect  as 

temperature  went  down  in  the  1H-  MAS  spectra  of  D-alanine.  (2)  In  the  1H  CRAMPS  spectra,   

peak  widths  of  α-H  and  β-H  showed  a  different  trend  between  alanine  enantiomers  when   

temperature  varied.(3)  The  dynamic  behavior  of  13C  spectra  showed  an  obvious  change  around 

250K, which was supposed as a phase transition in alanine crystal. In the discussion section, we 

give these experimental phenomena a possible explanation related to chirality.C

INTRODUCTION 

As  we  all  know,  our  biosystem  is  homochirality.  It's  very  strange  that  all  the  proteins  are 

made  exclusively  of  L-amino  acids.  The  evolution  of  homochirality,  closely  related  to  the 

evolution of life on the earth, has long been debated (Bonner, 2000; Keszthelyi, 2001). In order to

explain this phenomenon, we should study the property of amino acids enantiomers, which have 

been  considered  as  the  essential  molecular  building  blocks  for  life.  Alanine,  the  simplest  chiral 

amino acid, has been the subject for a number of studies in the past, but very few experiments are 

aimed  to  compare  the  differences  between  D-  and  L-  alanine  or  to  conduct  the  temperature 

dependence study of this biological important material. 

In  1991,  Professor  Abdus  Salam  suggested  a  possible  phase  transition  in  alanine  crystal  to 

explain the origin of homochirality (Salam, 1992). He calculated the critical temperature for this 

second-order phase transition based on BCS theory, gauge field theory and Higgs mechanism. In 

his  calculation,  the  critical  temperature  Tc of  this  phase  transition  is  about  250K.  Although  his 

theory  had  been  debated  drastically  (Figureau  et  al.,  1995;  Figureau  et  al.,  1993),  anyone  who 

opposed  him  could  only  give  evidence  to  deny  his  prediction  that  this  phase  transition  would 

eventually  change  D-  alanine  to  L-alanine.  The  question  that  whether  there  truly  exists  a  phase 

transition was poorly answered. Propelled by Salam’s hypothesis, our group have made a series of 

studies on alanine enantiomers (Wang and Shen, 1994; Wang and Shen, 1996; Wang and Yi, 2000) 

and discovered many unexpected phenomena around 250K. 

For  a  continuous  and  thorough  study  of  the  differences  between  alanine  enantiomers,  we 

performed the temperature dependent study of 1H CRAMPS and 13C CP/MAS solid state NMR of 

D- and L- alanine crystals. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Characterization of Samples 

The  powder  sample  of  D-  and  L-  alanine  were  obtained  from  Sigma  Chemical  Co.  Single 

crystal were grown by slow evaporation of saturated aqueous solutions at 4°C, then washed with 

 

2 

absolute alcohol, evacuated and kept in a desiccator. 

The  characterization  of  D-  and  L-alanine  single  crystal  was  performed  by  the  element 

analysis  (C,  H  and  N)  and  shown  a  good  agreement  with  the  theoretical  data.  Using  X-ray 

crystallography  at  293K,  the  cell  dimensions  of  D-  and  L-alanine  were  determined  as  the  same 

space  group  P212121,  orthorhombic,  a  =  0.60250nm,  b  =  1.2331nm,  c  =  0.57840nm,  V  = 

0.42972nm3. The data agree with Simpson (Simpson and Marsh, 1966) at 298K, a = 0.6032 nm, 

b=1.2343 nm, c = 0.5784nm, V = 0.4306nm3. It indicated that D- and L-alanine were pure single 

crystals containing no crystalline H2O molecule. The rotation angle ζ of D- and L-alanine solution 

was measured on Polarimeter PE-241MC at 293K with the wavelength of 589.6 nm respectively. 

Using the formula of [α] = ζ / (L ×C), the corresponding α of D- and L-alanine showed the same 

value but opposite sign. 

Low Temperature dependence of 1H ssNMR spectra of D- and L- alanine   

1.1H MAS(Magic-angle Spinning) ssNMR spectra of D- alanine 

D-alanine  crystals  were  finely  ground  and  packed  in  a  4  mm  rotor  sample  tube,  then  the 

sample  was  measured  by  Bruker  DRX  300  WB  from  220K  to  290K.  The  sample  amount  was 

94.9mg.  The  chemical  shift  anisotropy  of  the  nuclei  is  averaged  out  by  magic-angle  spinning 

(MAS). All the 1H -MAS spectra were externally referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) with the 

chemical shift value of the methyl resonance assigned as zero. The temperature dependence of the 

1H-MAS spectra of D-alanine from 220K to 290K was measured by single pulse excitation with a 

delay time of 4.5 µs at a spinning speed of 5 kHz with 256 scans. 

Since the high-resolution echo-MAS method measures only a fraction of the solid which is 

usually  small  at  room  temperature  and  quite  different  from  the  majority  of  the  solid  in  both

molecular motion and chemical environment. There is no obvious phenomenon in L-alanine. For 

comparison,  the  CRAMPS  technique  was  used  because  it  is  quite  efficient  in  removing  the 

homonuclear dipolar interactions, which measures the proton system as a whole (Hu et al., 1996). 

2.1H CRAMPS (Combined Rotation and Multiple-pulse spectroscopy) ssNMR of D- and L- 

alanine   

The  1H CRAMPS ssNMR spectra were  run on a Varian InfinityPlus-400 spectrometer with 

resonance frequencies 400.12 MHz  1H of D- and L-alanine. A 4mm chemagnetics double probe 

was used for the variable temperature 1H -CRAMPS experiments. A BR-24 multiple sequence was 

employed with a π/2 pulse width of 1.6µs and 64 scans with a 2 seconds recycle delay to acquire 

CRAMPS spectra.  1H NMR experiment was performed with 3 seconds recycle delay, 256 scans 

and a contact time of 2.5ms. The magic-angle spinning rate was 2.5 kHz for CRAMPS experiment. 

The  amount  of  polycrystalline  alanine  sample  was  26.8mg.  Chemical  shifts  were  externally 

referenced  to  TMS.  For  the  sake  of  investigating  the  temperature–dependent  proton  nucleus 

dynamics of D- and L-alanine molecules, the chemical shifts and peak widths of α-H and β-H of 

D- and L-alanine were measured. 

Low Temperature dependence of 13C CP/MAS(Cross Polarization and Magic-angle Spinning) 

ssNMR of D- and L- alanine   

1.13C-CP/MAS ssNMR of D- and L- alanine 

The sample was measured by Bruker DRX 300 WB spectrometer with a 300 MHz, 89 mm 

magnet  equipped  with  a  CP/MAS  accessory  from  220K  to  290K.  The  13C  chemical  shifts  were 

calibrated  through  the  external  adamantine  peak.  The  obtained  polycrystalline  samples  were 

ground  by  agate  mortar  before  the  NMR  measurements  in  order  to  eliminate  the  orientation 

 

4 

anisotropy  of  crystals  in  the  spinning  rotor.  The  spinning  speed  is  5  kHz.  Spectra  were  usually 

accumulated 256 times to achieve a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. 

2.13C-CP/MAS  ssNMR  of  D-  and  L-  alanine  measured  on  Varian  InfinityPlus--400 

spectrometer   

The  13C  CP/MAS  ssNMR  spectra  of  D-  and  L-alanine  were  obtained  on  Varian 

InfinityPlus-400  spectrometer  with  resonance  frequencies  100.62  MHz  for  13C.  A  4mm 

Chemagnetics double probe was used for variable temperature  13C CP-MAS experiments. It was 

performed  with  a  3  seconds  recycle  delay,  256  scans  and  a  contact  time  of  2.5  ms.  The  magic 

angle spinning rate was 5 kHz. The sample amount was 45mg. Chemical shifts were referenced to 

HMB (hexamethylbenzene) for 13C measurement. 

 

RESULTS 

Low Temperature dependence of 1H ssNMR spectra of D- and L- alanine 

1.1H MAS(Magic-angle Spinning) ssNMR spectra of D- alanine 

The  spectrum  of  D-alanine  shows  three  main  peaks  at  4.7720,  3.4085  and  0.9099, 

respectively at 290K. The signals are assigned to the NH3

+, α-CH and the CH3 group going from 

low to high magnetic field and the chemical shift values are coincident with those observed in the 

echo-MAS spectra (Ding and Charles, 1994; Hu et al., 1996). 

The results on D-alanine (shown in Fig. 1) acquired at various temperatures imply that there 

exists considerable differences between the surrounding electrical environment of the spin change, 

which contributes to the high-resolution spectral component 1H-αC. The peak of 1H-αC shows an 

obvious upshielding when the temperature decreases. The integral peak area ratio of NH3

+, α-CH

and  the  CH3  group  in  D-alanine  gradually  moves  from  3  :  1  :  3  to  3  :  0  :  4  (Table  1).  As  the 

temperature  goes  down,  some  peaks  appear  and  then  disappear  between  the  peak  of  1H-αC  and 

that of the methyl group, which is a sigh of the spin-spin coupling effect between the α-H and the 

proton in the methyl group. This result also demonstrates that the chemical environment of the two 

kinds  of  proton  become  the  same  as  the  temperature  falls  down.  Below  250K,  there’s  no  peak 

existing  between  the  two  peaks  that  are  assigned  to  methyl  group  and  amidogen  group

and L- alanine   

The chemical shifts and peak widths of α-H and β-H of D- and L-alanine are shown in Table 

2. Temperature dependence of the four peak widths of α-H and β-H is displayed in Fig.2. We can 

find a distinct maximum around 240K. In L-alanine case, the variation degrees of peak widths of 

α-H and β-H make a good agreement (the peak width is about two times as large as that in room 

temperature)  in  the  whole  process.  It  indicates  the  temperature-dependent  spin-spin  relaxation 

effects  of  α-H  of  and  β-H  nuclei  of  L-alanine  molecule  are  nearly  the  same  during  the  whole 

process. While in the case of D-alanine, the value of β-H peak width agrees with that of L-alanine, 

however, the variation of α-H peak width is much fiercer than that of its enantiomer in the same 

process. 

  From  the  experimental  data  in  Table  2  and  Table  3,  the  peak  linewidth  represents  the 

spin-spin relaxation time T2. The half height linewidth is given by ∆1/2 = 1 / π T2. R2 =T2

-1 is the 

sum  of  several  contributions,  which  corresponding  to  the  different  mechanisms,  namely

J. In the CRAMPS experiment, the dipolar interaction R2

D and the chemical shift

CSA  are  averaged  out  to  zero.  By  choosing  a  spin  1/2  nucleus  (1H),  the  nuclear 

quadrupole  moment  is  equal  to  zero,  thus  R2

Q  cancels  out.  The  J-coupling  R2

J  might  be  the 

predominant contribution. It confirms the result that we get above. The reason of the differences 

between D- and L- alanine in the NMR spectra will be discussed in the Discussion section. 

Low Temperature dependence of 13C CP/MAS(Cross Polarization and Magic-angle Spinning) 

ssNMR of D- and L- alanine 

1.13C-CP/MAS ssNMR of D- and L- alanine 

The spectra of D-/L-alanine show three main peaks at 280K as 139.385/139.393 ppm, 12.464 

/12.880,  12.403  ppm  and  –17.956  /  -17.961  ppm,  which  are  assigned  to  the  carbonyl  group 

(COO-), α-carbon (C-H) and β-carbon (CH3 group), respectively. We compare our results with Ye 

Chaohui and Asakawa N.et al. (Ye et al., 1993; Asakawa et al., 1992) and find good agreement. 

  The dynamic behavior of α-C signals obviously changes while temperature decreases (Fig. 

3). The splitting of α-C of D-alanine at 265K implies a phase transition and the coexistence of an 

intermediate.  A  quick  decrease  and  disappearance  of  α-C  peak  below  260K  are  also  worth 

noticing, but such phenomenon has not been observed in L-alanine’s spectra. 

2.  13C-CP/MAS  ssNMR  of  D-  and  L-  alanine  measured  on  Varian  InfinityPlus400 

spectrometer   

The  data  of  13C-CP/MAS  ssNMR  spectra  of  D-  and  L-alanine  are  shown  in  Table  5. 

Chemical shifts are referred to HMB (hexamethylbenzene) for 13C measurement. 

The spectra of D-/ L-alanine show three peaks at 250K as 178.036/ 177.992 ppm, 51.167 / 

51.015 ppm and 20.634 / 20.586 ppm, which are assigned to the carbonyl group (COO-), α-carbon 

 

7 

(C-H)  and  β-carbon  (CH3),  respectively.  Comparing  the  temperature  dependence  data  of 

13C-ssNMR  between  D-  and  L-alanine,  the  difference  is  worth  noticing.  The  chemical  shifts 

change  in  a  crystal  is  due  to  the  surrounding  electronic  environment  of  the  spin  change.  A 

variation  in  chemical  shift  may  happen  due  to  the  varied  shielding  effect.  We  propose  that  the 

upfield of α-carbon of D-alanine present α-C electron-shielding increase from the lenghtening of 

bond  distance  of  C-H  when  temperature  decreases  and  the  downfield  of  carbonyl  group  of 

L-alanine  represents  electron-deshielding  increase  as  a  result  of  the  decrease  of  the  electronic 

density. 

 

DISCUSSION 

  The method using NMR to detect the difference between enantiomers has been performed 

for  a  long  time.  J.  B.  Robert  and  A.  L.  Barra  proposed  a  theoretical  explanation  on  why  the 

enantiomers’  NMR  spectra  show  different  phenomenon  based  on  parity  nonconservation  (PNC) 

(Robert and Barra, 2001).There are essentially two static NMR parameters, namely the magnetic 

shielding  tensor σ  and  the  indirect  spin-spin  coupling  tensor J.  The  corresponding  Hamiltonian, 

written in frequency units for a nucleus i is 

Hi =    (1/2 π) γi Ii (1− σ) B0 

There  is  no  first  order  contribution  to σ.  Here  γi  is  nuclear  magnetogyric  ratio,  Ii  is  spin 

number operator. J is the indirect spin-spin coupling. 

In  general,  the  resonance  frequencies  and  the  spin-spin  couplings  of  the  corresponding 

nuclei in both isomers are identical. However, if PNC is taken into account, the NMR spectra of 

two enantiomers will show differences, expected to be small according to the prefactors existing 

 

8 

in the σPNC and JPNC matrix elements. Considering the case of σ for a nucleus alone, it comes for 

the D and L enantiomers: 

at the molecular level. 

νD = (1− σ −σPNC ) ν0 ,    νL = (1− σ + σPNC ) ν0 ,    ∆ ν = 2 σPNC γN B 

Thus a splitting in each line of a racemic mixture should be a clear cut manifestation of PNC 

  Here,  we  apply  Freedman’s  model  (Freedman  et  al.,  1985;  Nafie,  1997;  Freedman  et  al., 

1998)  to  stress  the  NMR  differences  between  alanine  enantiomers.  As  Freedman  has  proposed, 

there’s a molecular ring in the alanine molecular adjacent to the methine bond, which is closed by 

hydrogen  bonding.  The  Cα-H  stretching  generates  an  oscillating  electronic  current  in  the  ring, 

which gives rise to a large magnetic dipole transition moment. As depicted in Fig. 4, for the Cα-H 

contraction in an L-alanine, positive current is flowing in the direction N Cα when electrons are 

injected into the ring by the Cα-H contraction, producing a magnetic dipole transition moment m 

with  a  component  in  the  direction  of  the  electric  dipole  transition  moment  µ.  The  electron 

probability density is affected by the electric dipole transition moment µ, and the magnetic dipole 

transition  moment  m,  that  is  R=µ⋅m.  In  L-alanine,  R  is  positive  as  µ  and  m  have  the  same 

direction, but in its enantiomer, D-alanine, R is negative as µ and m are in opposite direction. As 

to the NMR theory, R contributes to the σPNC and JPNC matrix elements. 

We  cite  this  mechanism  to  explain  why  alanine  enantiomers  show  a  different  spin-spin 

relaxation time denoted by the peak widths in Fig. 2. We also conjecture that the peak moving in 

Fig.  1  is  due  to  the  effect  of  the  electric  dipole  transition  moment  and  the  magnetic  dipole 

transition moment generated by the molecular ring. It changes the electron probability density in 

the molecule, thus makes the chemical environment of the αH and the proton in methyl group the 

 

9 

same. It also brings about the change in 13C ssNMR spectroscopy.   

Putting  all  the  experimental  results  together,  we  should  pay  attention  to  a  particular 

temperature,  250K.  Around  this  specific  temperature,  alanine  enantiomers  show  great  different 

property.  In  other  words,  the  difference  between  alanine  enantiomers  reaches  the  maximum 

around  250K.  This  conclusion  coincides  with  our  previous  work  on  alanine  enantiomers  (Wang 

and Shen, 1994; Wang and Shen, 1996; Wang and Yi, 2000). The results of Raman spectroscopy, 

SQUID and NMR all confirm the existence of a phase transition, but it’s not a transition from D- 

to  L-  enantiomer,  as  Salam  originally  believed.  The  difference  between  enantiomers  is  easier  to 

detect  under  low  temperature  (below  the  room  temperature)  than  in  the  room  temperature.  The 

possible  quantum  mechanical  cooperative  and  condensation  phenomena  in  the  phase  transition 

process may account for this amplification effect. 

Although  Salam’s  hypothesis  has  failed  to  explain  homochirality  only  via  this  chirally 

selective  phase  transition,  the  significance  of  the  different  behavior  between  D-  and  L-  amino 

acids  in  the  phase  transition  will  never  be  neglected.  Salam  phase  transition  is  not  an  ultimate 

solution to homochirality, but the PVED (parity violating energy difference) between enantiomers 

are several orders of magnitude larger in the phase transition process. What is worth emphasizing, 

according to Salam, the occurrence of Salam phase transition can enhance the PVED a lot, which 

will in turn induce much higher probability of the transition, which is a kind of nonlinear feedback. 

Combining the existence of PVED, Salam phase transition and nonlinear dynamics, a sound way 

to achieve homochirality is shown in Fig. 5. Further in-depth research is in progress.

Abstract 

In a pioneering study experimental evidence was sought of thermosynthesis, a theoretical biological 
mechanism for free energy gain from thermal cycling that has been invoked as energy source for the 
origin of life.  A PCR machine applied thermal cycling to the K12 strain of Escherichia coli.  The 
viability of this organism during starvation was determined at cyclic and at constant temperature.  The 
found increase in the viability counts during the first days of starvation is consistent with thermosynthesis.  
The scattering in the results is however large.  Further research is needed to proof that the increase is 
indeed due to a thermosynthesis process.

INTRODUCTION 
From December 2004 to January 2006 the author worked as visiting assistant professor in Prof. 
Schulze-Makuch’s lab at the Geology Department of the Washington State University in 
Pullman.  The goal was to obtain experimental evidence for the theoretical notion of 
thermosynthesis, biological free energy gain from thermal cycling.1  This document reports on 
this endeavor.  

The simplest form of thermosynthesis uses a single protein that resembles the F1 subunit 

of today’s ATP synthase enzyme.  The simplicity has been applied in models for (i) the 
emergence of the genetic machinery in the RNA World2 and (ii) the emergence of the 
chemiosmotic energy conversion machinery.3  In thermosynthesis a free energy-yielding 
enzymatic cycle is synchronized with a thermal cycle.  Since in the natural environments thermal 
cycling times, such as during convection (~ 100 s), are in general much larger than turnover 
times of enzymes, for ATP synthase normally ~ 0.01 s, the power of thermosynthesis can only be 
small compared to that of regular processes such as respiration. This low power makes 
thermosynthesis difficult to detect. 

Nevertheless several direct experimental approaches for the detection of thermosynthesis 

have been proposed based on sensitive detection methods of small molecules formed during 
thermal cycling.4 Examples are the use of radioactive tracers, such as the uptake of 32P or 14C as 
a function of the intensity of thermal cycling.  Another proposed method involves the detection 
by luminometry of ATP synthesized during thermal cycling.  Michael Kaufmann in a first 
experimental search for thermosynthesis, has tried to detect ATP synthesized after thermal 
cycling of a candidate thermosynthesizing protein from Aquifex aeolicus, probably one of the 
oldest bacteria.5 These direct methods are called bottom-up approaches, since one works with 
enzymes, which are more simple than organisms.  Already known and identified enzymes may 
be investigated 

A top-down demonstration would, in a first step, involve showing a benefit of thermal 

cycling for whole organisms.  The second step would constitute the unraveling of the mechanism 
of the benefit, in the hope of identifying a partial process based on energy gain from thermal 
cycling.  Such an approach would resemble the standard working method in biochemistry, in 
which one takes a physiological function such as photosynthesis and respiration, and then works 
one way down to find the partial molecular processes.  In the case of the just mentioned 
physiological functions, finding these partial processes has taken many decennia.   

Compare thermosynthesis to nitrogen fixation.  In plants nitrogen fixation is a complex 
process that requires symbiotic anaerobic bacteria; the anaerobiosis may be a relic of reducing 
conditions on the early Earth.  Similarly the numerous thermoperiodic phenomena in biology 
may be a relic of the origin of life. After the transition from living on thermal cycling to living at 
constant temperatures on light or food, some enzymes in today's organisms may have kept the 
ability to make use of thermocycling.  When the temperature remains constant, the organism 
would have to spend much energy, using complex physiologies, to mimic thermal cycling.  
Applying thermal cycling to today's organisms then may be beneficial, since it would enable

performing some key processes at a smaller energetic cost.  Most interestingly, a similar notion 
has already been proposed:  according to the 'McLaren hypothesis' the organisms that perform 
daily vertical migrations in natural, thermally stratified waters do so because they gain an 
energetic advantage from the associated thermal cycling.6 

Microbiological methods especially are considered promising for the top-down method: a 

demonstration seems feasible of enhanced starvation survival of bacteria while they are 
thermocycled.  Again, such an effect would of course only be consistent with thermosynthesis, 
and proof would require the mentioned much more detailed investigation.  And even if 
thermosynthesis does not occur in bacteria, a study of the effect of rapid thermal cycling would 
be of interest on its own, and would be a continuation of studies from other authors on the effect 
of temperature on bacteria: rapid thermal cycling is an untried, easily applied, new potential 
handle on bacterial physiology. The offer by Susan Childers in May to use the facilities of her 
microbiology lab at the Geology Department of the University of Idaho for microbiological 
experiments was therefore gladly accepted. 

 

 
Figure 1 illustrates the proposed microbiological approach. Starvation is supposed to kill bacteria 
(or at least lessen their viability); their numbers should go down (although increases upon 
starvation have been reported as well).  Viable bacteria are counted by their Colony Forming 
Units (CFUs): bacteria are diluted until about 30 to 300 per 0.1 mL. This volume is put on an 
agar plate, which is incubated overnight in a 37 C oven.  The bacteria scattered over the agar 
plate multiply exponentially and overnight form visible and countable colonies.  The curve of 
CFU vs starvation time is called a starvation curve.  If thermal cycling were a stress factor, the 
starvation curve would go down with time due to the additional adverse factor; if it were 
beneficial, the curve would go up.  

In the use of starving bacteria the microbiological approach resembles the study of Gusev 
and Schulze-Makuch7 on the growth of Escherichia coli in distilled water.  Therein the observed 
increase of CFUs of starving bacteria is linked to naturally occurring radio waves that have not 
been shielded by metal.  It was hoped to investigate this phenomenon as well, but lack of time as

prevented this. The performed radio wave experiments are discussed in the Radio Wave 
Experiments section. 

We describe hereafter both the starvation and radio wave experiments in more detail. 

Although the results are inconclusive, and considered insufficient for publication in a scientific 
journal, they are considered of sufficient interest to publish them on the Internet.  They may 
easily be followed up. This document has therefore pedagogical purposes, and although it has the 
headings of a scientific article, the style is less concise. 

The literature on starvation and the effects of thermal shock in bacteria is extensive.  It is 

tempting to quote this literature extensively, but since investigating the effects of rapid thermal 
cycling is a new idea, and the existing literature is only partially applicable, we refrain from 
doing so.  In a later stage the literature cannot be ignored, of course, but in this early, pioneering 
stage the emphasis is on finding new phenomena and reproducing them.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

This section describes the constant part of the experiments; the variations in the method are topic 
of the RESULTS section.  
 
mediums used 
The composition of the mediums was taken from Molecular Cloning.8 
The LB medium (Luria-Bertani Medium): 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl. pH was adjusted to 7.0  
For pouring plates 15 g/L bacterial agar was added. 
The M9 minimal medium consisted of 750 mL sterile H2O to which had been added: 200 mL 5x M9 salts solution 
(made in turn from 64 g/L Na2HPO4.7H2O, 15 g/L KH2PO4, 2.5 g/L NaCl, 5.0 g/L NH4Cl), 2 mL 1 M MgSO4, 0.1 
mL 1 M CaCl2.  According to protocol the components of the M9 medium have to be sterilized by autoclaving them 
separately.  In addition some components were sterilized by filtration (0.22 µm filter): 0.1 mL/L chelated minerals, 1 
mL/L  Wolf’s medium, and 0.1 mL/L 20% glucose.9 
The PBS medium was used for dilution of bacteria.  It contained 8 g/L NaCl, 0.2 g/L KCl, 1.44 g/L Na2HPO4 and 
0.24 g/L KH2PO4. 
 
Susan Childers recommended the use of the bacterium E. Coli strain K12, a standard bacterium 
in microbiological research, also used by Gusev and Schulze-Makuch in their study (ref. 7). 
 
The working method was the following.  A sample of the bacteria strain was taken from 
the storage container in the freezer, and streaked out and diluted on an agar plate in the standard 
manner.  The plate was put in a 37 C oven overnight, whereafter it was put in the fridge.  A good 
looking (=  good circular symmetric) colony from this plate was taken for bacterial growth 
during the following months. 
When growing a new batch of bacteria, the colony was put in a tube with a few mL (3 – 
 
10) mL of LB medium and the tube was put overnight in a shaking bath at 37 C. When bacterial 
growth was visible, 0.1 mL of the LB medium was added to an erlenmeyer containing 100 mL of 
glucose-limited M9 growth medium. After a few hours the turbidity indicated bacterial growth 
and the OD666 (optical absorption at 666 nm) was tracked.  When the bacteria had consumed all 
glucose, growth ended; this occurred typically in the OD666 range 0.1 – 0.2.  The day of the onset 
of stationarity was counted as ‘day 0.’ The next morning the medium with the stationary bacteria 
was either directly diluted in the starvation medium (Runs 1, 2 and 3), or the bacteria therein 
were first repeatedly washed by the starvation medium, and then diluted (Runs 4, 5, 6 and 7). 
The reason for dilution (by a factor 100) was to lessen the chance of the occurrence of 
cannibalism. 
 
medium, which had the same composition as the growth medium minus glucose, chelated 
minerals and Wolff’s medium. Aliquots of 0.2 mL of the starvation medium were added to ~ 100 
PCR tubes.  By using many PCR tubes, an infection in one tube cannot infect another, and, more 
generally, tubes cannot affect each other. 
 
cyclic temperature (CT) was effected by a PCR thermocycler. Constant temperatures were 
applied at 35 or 37 C (oven temperature OT), at room temperature at 20 C (RT20) or in the 
fridge (FT04).   In Runs 5, 6 and 7 constant temperatures of 24, 27 or 37 C were effected by heat 
baths. 
                                                 
8 Sambrook and Russell, Molecular Cloning.  A Laboratory Manual, Appendix 2, section A2.2 
9 Schult et al, Journal of Bacteriology 170 (1988) 3903. In this study carbon starvation was effected by a glucose 
concentration of 0.025 % glucose wt /vol = 25 mg / 100 mL, which resulted in an OD666 of ~ 0.3, equivalent to 3 x 
108 cells/mL.  

The filled PCR tubes were exposed for several days to various thermal treatments. The 

Typically 1 mL of the growth medium with the bacteria was added to the starvation 

 

5

After the treatment, 0.1 mL of the 0.2 mL in the PCR tube was taken, diluted and plated.  

 
For instance 0.1 ml was added to a 9.9 ml dilution tube (dilution by 100), from which 1 ml was 
added to a 9 ml tube (dilution by 10).  When from the last tube 0.1. ml was taken, the conversion 
factor from plate to CFU/ml in the original solution equals 100 x 10 x 10 = 104 . Using the 
dilution data, the plate counts were converted to CFU or viable cells/mL, and plotted against 
exposure time (note that the time range on these plots varies).  
 
In our pioneering study, we started with a search for an effect, with the intention to increase the 
accuracy and precision after an effect had found; unfortunately that stage was not reached.  For 
optimal precision it is commonly advised to ignore plate counts outside the range 30 - 300. Since 
however differences by a factor 2 in plate counts in otherwise identical conditions were regularly 
found, even when counts did fall in the range 30 - 300, and plate counts cannot always be 
predicted, we used data below 30 or above 300, as long as counting was possible. We are aware 
that this constitutes an inaccuracy.  
 
During the analysis of the data a few outliers were met (in R2.2 an outlier is shown) and 
removed. The identification of a data point as outlier is somewhat subjective, and in a follow up 
study a defined procedure for removing them should be followed. 
   
Halfway the studies it was found that the dilution tubes could incur a —highly variable but 
significant— weight loss during sterilization (up to 5%). The determined plate counts were 
corrected for this, using an Excel spreadsheet and the weights of the liquids in the dilution tubes  
recorded after dilution.  
 
Radio wave experiments 
The radio wave setup consisted of a 6060A Fluke Synthesized RF Signal Generator which can 
produce the high frequency power. The frequency range is 100 kHz to 1050 MHz.  Two antennas 
permit the sending and receiving of radio waves.  A HP Model 478A Thermistor Mount 
connected to a HP 432A Power Meter was used to measure the received power.

RESULTS 

 
Run 1 (June 20 – July 6) 
 
In this run the CT treatment consisted of 10 min 37 C: 10 min 20 C.  The PCR machine often 
crashed, making frequent restarts necessary, which obviously was not always possible, for 
instance not at night.  Not much value should therefore be given to the CT results of this run. 
 
At the time it was considered unimportant, and therefore not recorded, whether the components 
of the growth medium were sterilized separately or not.   
 
The starvation medium did not contain Ca2+.

At days 2 to 6, the time of platings of different treatments, the CFUs were identical.  All 
treatments result in a CFU decrease. The data from this run do not yield evidence that the CT 
treatment increases the CFU compared to OT or RT treatments.

Run 2 (July 23 – August 6) 
 
The PCR machine was repaired.  
 
The thermal cycle was halved to 5 min: 5 min, as shortening the cycle time was expected to 
increase the chance of an observable effect.  The PCR machine can be programmed to a 
maximum of 99 cycles; after starting up, the machine runs for 18 – 20 h.  Upon a start late in the 
afternoon, it has to be restarted again the following morning in order to effect continuous cycling.  
Restarting was not always feasible, so on some days there was no thermal cycling for a few 
hours and the tubes then remained at constant room temperature for a few hours. 
The PCR machine cools by air.  Cooling takes much time if the target cooling temperature is 
near room temperature. In order to shorten the thermal cycling time the range of the temperature 
cycle was shifted to above room temperature, to 37:27 C. 
  
Ca2+ was absent in the starvation medium. 
 
As simulation of the Gusev and Schulze-Makuch experiments with radio waves (Ref. 7) some of 
the tubes kept at RT were wrapped in aluminum, the metal supposedly screening the tubes from 
radio waves by acting as a kind of Faraday cage (RT20A treatment).

Fig. R2.6: Combined results of the various treatments on days 1 to 8. 

 
The CT treated tubes (R2.1, R2.6) do not show a decrease in CFU. CT tubes show higher counts 
then RT and OT37 tubes, in agreement with the proposed beneficial effect of thermo cycling as 
shown in Figure 1. 
 
The OT37 tubes (R2.2) show a decrease in CFU until day 6, when the counts stabilize.  
The FT04 tubes (R2.5, R2.6) show a decrease, a decrease that at day 8 is larger than the 
decreases of the RT20 tube, an unexpected result.  The counts of RT20 tubes in turn are 
consistently lower than those of the OT37 tubes. 
  
The RT20A treatment seems to result in higher counts (about 500) than the RT20 treatment 
(under 500), which is in contrast with the Gusev – Schulze-Makuch findings (Ref. 7) that 
screening off of radio waves leads to a decrease in counts. . 
 
There is an overall increase in the CT and OT37 values in the second week. 
 
These results are considered consistent with a beneficial effect of the CT treatment.

Run 3 (August 18 - September 1) 
 
After discussion with Dirk Schulze-Makuch and Susan Childers, the following changes were 
made: 

1.  Two plates were made every day; on the first, the sixth and the fourteenth day, several 

plates were made. 

2.  One cause of variation may be a variable number of bacteria put in the tubes during 

filling, as bacteria may sink to the bottom of the erlenmeyer containing the starvation 
medium.  For this reason the erlenmeyer was better stirred.  During pipeting liquid was 
drawn up and let fall back three times to improve mixing as well. 

3.  In order to avoid the condensation that occurred in the plates during Run 1, the plates 
were kept in the oven all time during Run 2.  This however dries them out, and may 
lessen their sensitivity as this dryness makes it more difficult for bacteria to grow.  Plates 
were not kept in the oven any more, but were dried for about an hour in the oven before 
use. 

 
In Runs 1 and 2 a shortcut had been applied to the preparation of the growth and starvation 
mediums: the components had been added together in a single solution, and had then been 
sterilized.  As a result the medium acquired a milky look, which is attributed to a precipitate of 
Ca2+ with phosphate and/or sulfate.  Therefore these components were now sterilized separately 
first and mixed next, as prescribed by the protocol in Ref. 8, which states that the mixing has to 
occur below 50 C.   
When a precipitate is not formed in a solution because of a low temperature, but the precipitate is  
formed at a higher temperature, this quenching of precipitation implies the low-temperature 
stability of a chemical disequilibrium, from which organisms could in principle gain free energy.  
Direct coupling of the disequilibrium to ATP synthesis can easily be imagined, for instance by 
using a Ca2+-ATPase.

Fig. R3.5: Combined results of the various treatments on days 1 to 8. 

 
 
On the 6th day many platings were made for all treatments. Due to oversight no additional 
dilution was done for the CT plates.  Most of the counts were estimated to be far above 1000.  
The few counts below 1000 were interpreted as the low end tail of an average above 1000. 
The counts at day 6 in R3.1 and R3.5 are therefore estimates.  
 
The key issue is the large variation in the counts.  A main parameter is the ratio of standard 
variation and the average, which is about 0.5 for the tubes on day 1, which have not undergone 
any treatment. The platings at days 6 and 14 show similar values.  One expects this ratio to go up 
following the treatments, and not to go down.  The scattering is much wider than the Poissonian 
(statistical) variation of √ n that can be expected for plating.  For instance, for a CFU of 25 the 
Poissonian variation is 5, for a CFU of 400 it is 20.  Regularly, however, counts between plates 
differ by a factor 2.  As long as the cause of this large variation is unknown one should be very 
careful to draw conclusions from effects of changes in experimental parameters, as these changes 
may affect this unknown cause instead of the proposed energy generator. 
     

15

In contrast to Runs 1 and 2, the average counts are increasing for all treatments, except for the 
FT04 treatment.    
 
This increase resembles the results of Gusev and Schulze-Makuch.  Note however that in their 
study the bacteria were kept in distilled water, whereas here the bacteria are kept in a buffer.  
 
The CT treatment shows the largest increase, at the 14th day the counts have increased by a factor 
40.  The OT37 treated tubes show an increase by a factor 10 after 14 days.  The RT20 treatment 
results in an increase by a factor 4.  The FT04 treatment shows an initial increase, but at days 6 
and 14 the CFU have gone down. 
 
In this run the CT treatment indeed resulted in a higher count.   

 

16

Run 4 ( September 10 - September 19) 
 
This run was broken of after infection was detected. 

 

17

Run 5 (September 20 – September 28) 
 
In this run the bacteria are washed after having reached the starvation stage; washing involves 
centrifuging for 15 min at 3500 rpm, discarding of the supernatant and resuspension of the pellet 
containing the bacteria in 20 ml of the starvation medium. The washing is performed three times, 
after which the bacteria are put in the starvation medium from which the PCR tubes are filled.  
 
The dilution procedure consists of taking a sample from the PCR tube, and putting it in the first 
dilution tube.  From this a sample is transferred to the second dilution tube, from which in turn 
the plated sample is taken.  In this run the volume transferred between the dilution tubes was 
varied in such a way that the plate count was between 30 and 300. 
 
The weights of the liquid in the dilution tubes were recorded after plating.

Fig. R5.5: Combined results of the various treatments on days 1 to 8. 

 
 
The CT treatment (R5.5) resulted in strongly increased counts in the range 2500-3500, i.e. in an 
increase by a factor 6 in some, but not all, tubes during the first five days.  Thereafter the values 
returned to the original value on day 1. At day 8 there is little difference with OT37 and OT28.   
 
On day 2 both the CT treatment and the OT37 treatment result in an increase. 
 
The large increases in counts after one week seen in Run 3 are absent here.  The applied washing 
procedure may have removed traces of the carbon source that had remained in Run 3. 
 
The beneficial effect of thermal cycling is pronounced in a few, but not all, CT tubes during the 
days 2 to 5.

Just as in the previous run there is an increase in CFUs until the fifth day for the CT treated tubes; 
there is however an increase for the OT37 treatments and OT28 until that day as well.  The 
results are in good agreement with the previous run.

Run 7 (November 4 – November 12)  
 
At a meeting with Dirk Schulze-Makuch and Susan Childers it was decided to do another run, 
with modifications.  The cycle range was increased to between 37 and 24 (extending the range to 
a lower value turned out to be impractical).  Only two OT treatments were performed, at the 
range ends: 24 and 37 C.  
 
A new method was applied to insert and remove the PCR tubes from the thermocycler.  As a 
result the tube may have made a better thermal contact with the PCR machine.

Fig. R7.5: Like R7.4, but with hand-drawn curves added. 

 
Figure R7.1 shows little difference between the values of the duplicates, possibly because of the 
better thermal contact.  The standard variation / average ratios are relatively low on day 8 as well, 
but on the first day the ratio still is about 0.5. 
On day 4 the CT treatment has resulted in a 20 fold increase of the CFU, but then the increase 
collapses.  
 
The expectation hat been that the OT24 treatment would yield values between those of the OT28 
and OT20 treatments; they were however much higher, an unexpected result.  This result 
suggests that it may be necessary to record starvation curves at more constant temperatures than 
has been done until now, in order to establish that a CT treatment gives different results than a 
properly time-averaged treatment over the temperature range of the cycle.  
 
Two to five days after the onset of stationarity, thermal cycling results in an increase of CFUs 
compared to those of constant temperatures. Thereafter the CFUs decrease again to their original 
values: see R5.1, R6.1 and R7.1.  The OT37 treatment, as shown by R5.2, R6.2 and R7.2, leads 
to an increase as well, but seems to decrease earlier.   
 
Thermal cycling is seen to result in an increase in CFU count, which however also happens for 
the OT37 treated tubes.    
 
 
Halfway this run Susan Childers made chromatograms of the proteins in the CT treated bacteria 
and in the constant temperature treated bacteria.  No differences were seen.   
 

 

26

Study of variability 
Susan Childers suggested to get more information on the cause of the variability by repeatedly 
taking —necessarily small— samples of 20 µL from the same PCR tube, and plating these (only 
one  dilution is needed).  This was done for several tubes:

These plots show that a large part of the variation is intrinsic to the tubes. 
 
Note that on the plot of the CT37:24 treated tubes in contrast to R7.1, no peak at days 3-4, 
followed by a collapse, can be discerned.  The OT37 tubes show however a decrease with time 
similar to R7.2.  The OT24 treated tubes show the same increase as R7.3

Radio Wave Experiments 

 
The Gusev experiments 
We have already referred several times to the experiments by Gusev and Schulze-Makuch (ref. 7) 
on bacteria growth in highly-purified water under the condition that external radio waves can 
reach the bacteria (no shielding).  In these experiments the same microorganism and M9 growth 
medium was used as in the present search for thermosynthesis.  It was hoped to reproduce and to 
extend the Gusev experiments, but due to lack of time only some preliminary work was done.  
   
It concerns two types of experiments. The first type started with a washed bacteria concentration 
of about 103 CFU/ml in highly-purified distilled water. In the absence of an obvious chemical 
energy source, the concentration nevertheless reached the value of 105 – 106 CFU/ml after two 
weeks.  There was scattering in the growth:  for instance, after one week in three of the samples 
shown the CFU concentration still was about 103 CFU/ml, whereas in three other samples it was 
already about 106 CFU/ml.  This CFU increase could be impeded by storing the bacteria in a 
chamber made of permalloy10: after about 4 days the CFU concentration had gone down to nil.  
In these experiments the growth medium is in contact, by a set of filters, with open air. 
The second type of experiment started with a high bacteria concentration, ~ 5 107 
 
CFU/ml, also in highly-purified water.  The tubes were hermetically closed:  there was no 
contact with the open air.  The CFU concentration decreased linearly on a log (CFU) vs time plot, 
ending at ~ 2 105 CFU/ml after 9 days.  The permalloy had an adverse effect here as well.  The 
CFY concentration went down faster when the tubes where kept inside the permalloy chamber 
(as 10 - 0.31 d , equivalent to a half time of 1.0 days) than when they were kept outside the 
chamber in a thermostat (as 10 - 0.22 d, ~ half time 1.4 days).  
 
Gusev and Schulze-Makuch give as explanation that the bacteria gain energy from external radio 
waves, and channel this energy into growth (the first type of experiments) or delayed death 
(second type).  The permalloy would screen the external radio waves, and their beneficial effect.    
 
What could be a mechanism for this beneficial effect?  Biological energy conversion 
makes use of the chemiosmotic mechanism, in which for instance during photosynthesis or 
respiration a voltage is effected across a membrane.  ATP is generated as protons move from the 
positive to the negative side of the membrane through the enzyme ATP synthase.  It is proposed 
that radio waves transfer protons across the membrane against the potential, so that when the 
protons return ATP can be made by means of the chemiosmotic mechanism.  
 
So the new question is, how could protons be pumped across the membrane? In distilled 
water the protons that result from the water dissociation reaction will function part of the time as 
free charges.  In other media, for instance in fluorescent tubes, in the atmosphere at great heights, 
and in the Sun, such freely moving charges can behave as a plasma, a state of matter differing 
from the more familiar solid, liquid or gas states of matter.  The ions in the plasma can undergo 
vibrations which are called ‘Langmuir oscillations.’ The angular frequency ω of the oscillations 
equals:

which external electric and magnetic fields are screened off.

ν =  e √ ( nH / π m ε). 

ω = e √ ( 4 π nH / m ε), 

 
 
where e is the elementary charge, nH is the number of charge carriers per unit volume, m is the 
charge carrier’s (proton) mass and ε is the dielectric constant.11  Note that in the case of protons 
nH will vary with the pH.  Reference 7 gives more detail of how, as the Langmuir oscillation is 
excited by the radio waves, the oscillating proton could gain enough energy to cross the 
membrane barrier of about 0.1 V.  Making use of the relation ω =  2 π ν, where ν is the frequency, 
it follows that 
  
 
 
At pH 7,  nH  = 10 - pH NA (protons / L),  where NA is Avogadro’s number, equal to 6.022 1023.  Thus nH = 6.022 1016 
at this pH. Multiplication by the conversion factor 1000 L/m3 then yields 6.022 1019 protons /m3.  The frequency 
then equals 1.602 10 - 19  √ (  6.022 1019 /  (3.141 x 1.673 10 - 27 x 80 x 8.854 10 -12
 ) ) = 0.644 10 9 s - 1 = 644 MHz. 
 
At lower pH, say 6 or 5, this value must be multiplied with √ 10, respectively 10, yielding 2037, 
resp. 6440 MHz12.   
 
Experiments at geology 
Somewhat arbitrarily, the just mentioned value of 644 MHz was chosen as frequency for the 
irradiation experiments.  Note that the value in the signal generator used can easily be set to 
another value.  When a pH measurement would yields 5.8, the proton concentration equals  

10 - 5.8  =  1.58 10 - 6 =  15.8 10 - 7. 

 

Taking the square root of 15.8 yields 3.97; multiplication of 3.97 with 644 MHz yields  
2557 MHz for the resonance frequency. 
 
The frequency range of the generator is 100 kHz to 1050 MHz.  The lowest pH of which the 
resonance frequency can be irradiated equals pH 6.6  (1050 / 644 = 1.63; squaring yields 2.6; 
multiplication by 10 - 7 yields 2.6 10 - 7, which corresponds to a pH of 6.6).  So at lower pH one 
may only be able to investigate the lower side band of the optimum resonance frequency.  The 
intention was to radiate at say 644, 800, and 1000 MHz, and to see whether a found biological 
effect indeed increased when resonance frequency was approached.  
 
The radio wave setup was tested by varying the frequency at constant emitted power of 19 dBm 
and recording the absorbed power indicated by the power meter.  

                                                 
11 The values of e, m and ε: the elementary charge e equals 1.602 10 - 19 C; the proton mass m equals 1.673 10 - 27 kg; 
the dielectric constant ε = ε r ε 0, where ε r equals the relative dielectric constant, for water 80, and ε0 equals the 
permittivity of the vacuum, equal to 8.854 10 - 12  C2 / N2 m2. 
 
12  This pH range of 5 – 7 follows from the statements that the pH would have to be larger than 5. Above pH 7 the 
significant presence of other positive ions follows from the need of having to compensate for the present OH- ion.

fre que ncy (MHz )

The figure shows the measured absorbed power in the absence of any absorbing substance 
between the antennas. Peaks are visible  at ~ 50, 200, 270, 310, 350, 400 and 560 MHz.  
These peaks area associated with the shape of the antennas, which are of the not further 
explained ‘log-periodic array’ type (see google).   
 
The power transferred from the sender to the receiver depends therefore strongly on the 
frequency, which should be taken into account when investigating frequency dependency of a 
biological effect from using this type of set up.  
 
The preliminary studies done were: 
(a) during Run 1: a CFU count in a few (4) 42-days old PCR tubes;  
(b) during Run 3: two experiments with larger numbers (12 and 10) of tubes. 
In Run 3 the counts of the thermosynthesis studies were rather high; there was growth, possibly 
because of traces of nutrients in the medium.  In Run 4 the bacteria were therefore washed.  It 
was noted that bacteria washed in distilled water had a different color from those washed in the  
M9 medium.  Unfortunately, there was no time left to subject the bacteria prepared in the manner 
of Ref. 7 to the radio wave type experiments.  Although there are no results, the methods used in 
(a) and (b) may be of interest. 
 
In (a) 5 41-day old tubes were irradiated, and the control group of 4 PCR tubes was not irradiated.  
The counts of the irradiated group were 157, 213, 352, 354 and 414: average 298 ± 106;  the 
control had counts 56, 123, 203 and 221: average 151 ± 77.  The difference is 147, not much 
smaller than the sum of the standard deviations of the counts of the two groups.  
Due to computer failure some data (radiation time) of this experiment was lost. 
 
During Run 3 the treated tubes were irradiated at maximum power (19 dBm) for three days while 
place at a distance of 0.62 m from  the antenna.  The controls were kept in the same room, at the 
larger distance of 5.5 m from the antenna.  

 

31

The plate count of the irradiated tubes was 95 ± 29 (n  = 12; sd / av = 0.31. dilution factor 103); 
for the controls these numbers were 105 ± 44 (n = 13; sd / av 0.42) . 
 
A week later, the experiment was repeated.  The corresponding numbers:  
plate count irradiated tubes 43 ± 17  (n  = 10; sd / av = 0.40);  
for the controls these numbers were 42 ± 20 (n = 10; sd / av 0.49).  
 
There is no significant difference between the treatment and the control group. 
 
Unfortunately the results of the experiments form Run 3 have limited validity, as there was such 
a large increase in CFU during this run, which is attributed to remaining trace amounts of 
nutrients. The absence of this increase in later runs is attributed to the washing of the bacteria in 
these later runs. 
Another difference between the experiments in Run 3 and Gusev experiments is that in the 
former the bacteria are placed in a buffer, whereas in the latter they are placed in highly purified 
distilled water.  
 
Clearly more research is needed, and no conclusions can be drawn at this moment.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 

During the first few days, say until day 4-5, there are large increases in count for the CT 
treatment, and to some extent for the OT37 and OT28 treatment as well.  Here a beneficial effect 
of thermal cycling seems to be present.  After a few days the increase in CFU however collapses. 
 
Overview of the runs 
As few platings were done and the thermocycler did not work well, the results of Run 1 have 
little relevance.   

In Run 2 more platings were done, but still too few.  R2.1 shows that the CT treatment 

did not result in a decrease in CFUs, whereas at constant temperature R2.2, R2.3, R2.4 and R2.5 
show a decrease in CFU during the first five days.   

In Run 3 many more platings were made, both in the beginning, halfway and at the end of 

the experiment. At day 6 counts were seen to increase the most for the CT treatments (R3.1; 
although not a precise value can be given for the colonies since there were too many too count), 
with smaller increases for the OT37 (R3.2) and RT20 (R3.3) treatments.  The CFUs of the tubes 
kept in the fridge decreased (R3.4).  There was a general large scattering in the results during this 
run, the standard deviation being typically about 50% of the average.  Several attempts were 
made to enhance the accuracy.   

Run 4 failed due to infection.  
In Runs 5, 6 and 7 it was found that after one week (day 8) the thermally cycled tubes 

showed an increase by a factor 1.4 (Run 5),  3.6 (Run 6) and 3.7 (Run 7).  The constant 
temperature treatments gave as results, at 37 C: a decrease by a factor 0.26 (Run 5), 0.39 (Run 6) 
but an increase of 4.2 (Run 7); at 28 C: an increase 1.1 (Run 5), 2.2 (Run 6); at 24 C: an increase 
of 15.5 (Run 7), and, at 20 C: decreases of 0.69 (Run 5) and 0.73 (Run 6).  See the table:

Whereas in Run 5 and 6 the CT treatment clearly resulted in a large growth compared to all 
constant temperatures, in Run 7 the constant 37 C and constant 24 treatment resulted in higher 
values than the CT treatment; in the case of CT34 in much higher values. 
There is no clear pattern on day 8. 
 
The variation issue 
Obviously the large scattering in the result should be lowered.  Much attention was given to find 
the cause of this scattering.   The PCR tubes were boiled in order to remove traces of nutrients, 
the plates were properly dried (so that they were not too dry but also not too moist), the solutions 
containing the bacteria were mixed thoroughly, the streaking out of the bacteria on the plates was 
done uniformly. 

On the Internet I found a document by the Alken-Murray Corporation titled 'Plate Count 
Procedure', on the 'Quality Control Method' for the 'Count of Aerobic Micro-Organisms.'  Some 
quotes taken from the 'Notes about this procedure':

Sampling error usually occurs because of an unequal distribution of cells in the 
culture or dilution fluid; the goal is to distribute the cells evenly by thorough 
mixing and then to obtain a representative sample in the sterile pipettor tip.  
Technical error is most often due to some inaccuracy in preparing dilution blanks 
or in pipetting technique.  Error can be minimized by precise measurements in 
preparing blanks and by accurate pipetting technique, but it is impossible to 
avoid all error.  Serial dilution and plating is at best an estimate of the number of 
live organisms present in the sample.  Ideally, one organism should form a single 
colony, but cells may stick together to form chains and clumps, and they too will 
form a colony. 

and 

The 95% confidence limit for spread plates containing 15 to 300 colonies is ±12% 
to ±37%.  In practice, even greater variation may be found especially among 
results obtained by different microbiologists. 
Large scattering in plate counts is a known phenomenon. 
 
One explanation for the different results between the runs is that for each a different colony is 
used, and the bacteria in the colonies have mutated during their growth and subsequent starvation 
on the plate. 
 
Mutation may also occur while the bacteria were initially grown during a run, before the onset of 
starvation.  After starvation the bacteria grow however hardly at all, and it is not plausible for 
some of them to have acquired by mutation the ability to digest the plastic of the PCR tube, and 
that this selected for growth.   
 
The experiments of Gusev are puzzling because of the large increase in CFUs in the absence of a 
known energy source in the distilled water medium.  The present study is equally puzzling, 
because of the large CFU increase the first few days after the onset of starvation, followed by a 
collapse.  
 
Changes in CFU can be associated with (i) a change in viability in a large, constant population of 
bacteria and (ii) with a real change in numbers of bacteria.  In order to make this distinction the 
total of viable and non-viable bacteria should be counted, as can be done under the microscope. 
 
Quorum sensing 
The phenomenon of 'quorum sensing' shows that cultures of bacteria can have collective 
attributes:  bacteria do not always behave independently. As a result of different onsets of 
negative feed-backs processes, the culture in one PCR tube may function very different from 
another. For instance, suppose that a high bacterial density, which may be local, is required for 
the secretion of a suppressor of  division.  When cells sink to the bottom of PCR tube, the less 
well mixed culture may locally reach the critical threshold density sooner than the well mixed 
culture, resulting in an overall lower number of bacteria in that less-mixed tube. Quorum sensing 
thus constitutes a random factor that can explain scattering, but only in general terms.  
 
The maximal CFUs found for the thermal cycled bacteria in runs 5, 6 and 7 is about  
1 - 3 106 CFU/ml.  The similarity is surprising, since the start values of the these runs are 525, 
194 and 48 103 CFU/ml.  

 

34

Interestingly, an identical end value of about 106 CFU/ml has also been observed by Gusev in his 
experiments on bacteria growth in distilled water, starting with 102, 104, 105 and 106 CFU/ml 
(Gusev: personal communication). 
 
General comments 
The M9 medium, even without glucose, is at a chemical disequilibrium, as shown by the 
formation of a Ca-precipitate at high temperature. In principle starving organisms could generate 
free energy from this disequilibrium.  Calcium precipitation is a very important process in the 
environment, and is known to be microbiologically enhanced.  
 
There is an extensive literature on starvation in bacteria, and it is known that bacteria can 
undergo morphological changes as a reaction, forming for instance very small bacteria.  The 
viability can vary strongly as well.13  The just mentioned small bacteria may use proteins inside 
the bacteria during the onset of starvation as energy source.14    
 
Demonstrating thermosynthesis 
The target of the present study was to find an effect of thermocycling.  The found large increase 
in CFUs during the first few days after the onset of starvation is such an effect.  In a follow-up 
the reproduction of the effect should be a first goal.  When the phenomenon is reproduced, the 
standard methods of biochemistry and molecular biology, such as the detection of newly 
emerged proteins and nucleic acids, could be applied.  This it could be established whether the 
phenomenon is related to thermosynthesis.  
 
biological energy conversion.  It has a large explanatory power.  The magnitude of the effect 
makes it difficult to investigate it experimentally. Many phenomena in the life sciences are much 
easier investigated, with corresponding larger chance of success.   

Thermosynthesis is at present mainly a theory for the origin of life and the emergence of 

This study is not the first experimental attempt to demonstrate thermosynthesis: Michael 

Kaufmann (Ref. 5) has already tried to detect ATP synthesis by thermal cycling a candidate 
protein isolated from Aquifex aeolicus, one of the oldest bacteria.   The present study points to  
another plausible experimental handle on thermosynthesis.   

Since Aquifex has a smaller distance to the origin on the map of the Tree of Life, it seems  

a more promising candidate for thermosynthesis than E. coli.  There are many organisms in 
which thermosynthesis may occur, and many environments seem suitable for thermosynthesizers, 
both terrestrial and extraterrestrial.  The methodology described in this study may therefore find 
a more general use.

Conclusion 

In a pioneering study the effect of rapid thermal cycling on the CFU count of starving 
Escherichia coli was investigated.  There is a slow increase during the first four or five days, 
followed by a collapse during the next few days. The most pronounced beneficial effect of 
thermal cycling seems to occur at the fourth day after the onset of starvation.  
 
More research is needed to improve the method.  Especially a decrease in the standard deviation 
of the measured CFUs is needed: a randomizing factor is present that could not be identified.    
 
Microbiologists should be aware that even in the absence of glucose, the Ca2+ ions present in the 
M9 medium commonly used results in a chemical disequilibrium that constitutes a potential 
biological energy source.  This point was unfortunately realized late in the study. 
 
This study shows that thermosynthesis can be investigated experimentally in whole organisms.

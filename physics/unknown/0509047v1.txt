with  the  volume  in  the  same  manner  as  the  entropy  of  an  ideal  gas  formed  by  particles.

INTRODUCCION 

Recently,  several  implications  of  a  crystalline  model  for  the  vacuum  cosmic  space  with 

lattice parameter of the order of the neutron radius have been analyzed [1, 2].  In the first 

paper [1] a formal analogy between dislocation creep and Relativistic Cosmology has been 

explored.  One  of  the  new  equations  obtained  for  cosmology  has  two  characteristic 

distances:  the present Universe radius, ROU, and the lattice parameter which is roughly the 

neutron radius size rN.  In the second paper [2] Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle was used 

to  find  the  gravitational  stability  condition  of  the  crystalline  structure  of  vacuum  space.  

This stability condition implies an equation which relates the temperature, T(r), the radial 

distance,  r,  and  the  energy  density,  U(r),  of  the  gravitational  waves  under  an  adiabatic 

compression process due to their own interaction.  Such equation is formally equal to one 

previously  obtained  by  Gamow  and  coworker  [3,4],  once  pair  production  has  ceased,  to 

predict the present microwave background temperature from the matter density. Gamow’s 

equation arises from general relativity theory as applied to the big bang event. 

In mathematical language, on the one hand, for the gravitational waves which stabilize the 

crystalline vacuum space structure under an adiabatic compression process due to their own 

gravitational interaction, we have:

On the other hand, for the relativistic case we have that  once  pair production has ceased, 

ρthe matter density varies simply as [3-5].

where  T1  and  To  are  absolute  temperatures,  L1  and  Lo  are  radial  distances.  According  to 

Penzias [5]:  “If we take T1 and 

1ρ  to be the radiation temperature and matter density at the 
time  of  deuterium  formation  (109K  and  10+5g/cm3),  we  have  the  relation  first  used  by 

Gamow  to  predict  the  present  temperature  of  the  microwave  background  from  the  matter 

density”. Also Eqs. (1) and (2) are also formally similar with previous conclusions obtained 

by Homer Lane in (1869) called to Lane’s theorem (as cited by Chandrasekhar [6]) for the 

uniform  expansion  of  an  ideal  gas  sphere,  where  particles  of  such  gas  are  interacting 

gravitationally. 

This  equality  between  Eqs.  (1)  and  (2)  is  meaningful  because  Eq.  (1)  is  referring  to 

gravitational  waves  for  the  crystalline  vacuum  cosmic  space  model  and  Eq.  (2)  refers  to 

matter  packages  arising  from  the  big  bang.    And  by  considering  that  both  processes  are 

adiabatic in nature (compression for the first one and expansion for the big bang) then it is 

possible, by energy conservation, to consider such event as a totally inelastic interaction or 

collision  between  incoming  gravitational  waves  and  an  out  coming  stream  of  matter 

packages from the big bang.  In other words, it is possible to imagine such process as a full 

transformation of such gravitational waves, which stabilize the crystalline structure of the 

vacuum cosmic space, into matter quanta during the first instants of the big bang. 

This last hypothesis deserves further exploration because according to usual considerations 
(see Penrose [7]) the baryons number in the present Universe volume VOU is 1080; and the 

total energy inside VOU due to gravitational waves for the crystalline structure stabilization 

of the vacuum cosmic space is

This transformation of gravitational stabilizing waves of the vacuum space with crystalline 

structure  into  matter  quanta  (neutrons)  could  be  studied  in  two  complementary  schemes.  

First  a  thermodynamic  one,  second  a  quantum  scheme.    This  last  scheme  will  be  worked 

out in a separate paper.  

In  this  paper  the  thermodynamic  analysis  will  be  made  in  two  possible  ways.    First  we 

study the entropy properties of the gravitational self-attracting waves, later an analysis on 

the  Gibbs  free  energy  changes,  in  the  crystalline  vacuum  cosmic  space,  due  to  the 

transformation process of gravitational waves (before mentioned) into matter quanta will be 

Before the classical work due to Einstein concerning an heuristic point of view toward the 

emission and light transformation [8], theoretical physicists consider that a profound formal 

distinction  exists  between  the  theoretical  concepts  regarding  gases  and  other  ponderable 

bodies and the Maxwellian theory of electromagnetic process in the so - called empty space 

Einstein by obtaining the asymptotic form for the monochromatic electromagnetic radiation 

entropy at low radiation density and large values of 

T/ν ; shows that such entropy varies 

with the volume in the same manner as the ideal gas entropy or a dilute solution.  And he 

also shows that low density monochromatic radiation (within the validity range of Wien’s 

radiation  formula)  behaves  thermodynamically  as  though  it  consisted  of  a  number  of 

independent energy quanta or discrete energy corpuscles hν. 

It  is  clear  that  at  the  present  day  is  not  possible  to  make  experiments  concerning 

gravitational waves, however there are many experimental data for electromagnetic waves; 

and  because  for  weak  gravitational  fields,  which  corresponds  to  the  linear  region  of  the 

6

Einstein’s  field  equations  there  is  a  strong  analogy  between  Maxwell’s  and  Einstein’s 

equations  one  would  expect  that  electromagnetic  and  gravitational  waves  have  a  similar 

behavior.    Based  in  such  consideration  on  the  one  hand,  it  is  possible  to  see  that  the 

gravitational  waves  which  stabilize  the  crystalline  structure  of  the  vacuum  cosmic  space 

obey the following behavior

On the other hand, when inside a volume V we have a gas formed by an arbitrary number,

where  V<  VOU.  By  comparing  Eq.  (6)  with  Eq.  (8)  it  is  clear  that  the  entropy  of 

monochromatic  gravitational  waves  of  sufficiently  low  density  varies  with  the  volume  in 

the same manner as the ideal gas entropy or a dilute solution.

compatibility condition in a physical sense only admits the solution implied by the big bang 

where  nB  denotes  the  baryons  number  (10 )  inside  V

OU,  with  a  value  for νg  equal  to νN

These equations have the following physical meaning.  At the big bang, the energy of all 

the  gravitational  waves  which  stabilize  the  crystalline  vacuum  cosmic  space  against 

gravitational fluctuations behaves thermodynamically as though it consisted of a number nB 

of independent energy or matter quanta of magnitude hνN = uN.

which  means  that  the  energy  of  1040  gravitational  waves  for  the  stabilization  of  the 

crystalline  structure  of  the  vacuum  cosmic  space  transforms  into  a  matter  quanta  called 

neutron.  This situation and the occurrence of a previous adiabatic compression process of 

gravitational  waves,  open  up  the  possibility  that  elementary  matter  quanta  could  be 

conceptualized as a new kind of black-hole formed by gravitational waves circling around a 

center in a similar way to the De Broglie model of matter packages.  This possibility will be 

examined elsewhere.

Equations (14) and (15) have the classical form of entropy function.  By denoting SOU for

This  result  explains  the  low  value  of  the  starting  Universe  entropy  at  the  big  bang  as 

requested by Penrose [6].  (The associated problem of bounds on the entropy of any object 

or system of maximum radius R and total energy E [12] as implied by our analysis will be 

studied in a future paper.  

From  information  provided  in  this  paper  it  is  clear  that  the  internal  energy,  EOU,  due  to 

quantum fluctuations to stabilize the crystalline structure of vacuum cosmic space inside a 
volume VOU is 10-40 times the internal energy of the perfect crystalline structure of vacuum

      In  other  words,  in  a  thermodynamic  scheme  we  are 

facing a fluctuation in internal energy of the crystalline structure of vacuum space. 

In crystalline physics many of the processes occur under constant volume (here ΔV/VOU ~ 
10-40) and the Gibbs free energy per unit volume, Gg, is frequently simplified to read [13].

where  E  is  internal  energy,  T  absolute  temperature  and  S  entropy.  With  E  and  S  as 

measured  relatives  to  the  perfect  crystal.    Because  in  our  analysis  we  are  facing  a 

fluctuation  in  the  internal  energy  of  the  crystalline  structure  of  vacuum  space  in  some 

conditions the change on Gg will be greater than zero and in other situations the change on 

Gg will be lower than zero, but in the average a value zero for the change on Gg is expected. 

Therefore in our case we have that for the starting of the gravitational stabilization process 

of the crystalline structure of vacuum (Gg)OU is:

(19) 

And also for the physical situation where gravitational waves for gravitational stabilization 

of  the  crystalline  structure  of  vacuum  cosmic  space  transforms  into  matter  quanta  

(specifically in neutrons).  This means that ( Gg)NF appears as  

(Gg)NF  =  ENF - TNF SNF 

 

(20) 

where ENF = EOU because of the adiabatic nature of the self-compression occurring between 
the previously mentioned gravitational waves, TNF is equal to 1013K as before, and SNF  =  
1080K. With these values (Gg)NF becomes

(21)

11

Therefore (Gg)OU = (Gg)NF means that the Gibbs’  free energy of the crystalline structure of 

vacuum space due to quantum fluctuations for gravitational stabilization of vacuum space is 
equal to the Gibb’s free energy of the crystalline structure when 1080 baryons (neutrons) are 

formed before the big bang begins. 

3. 

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSSIONS 

3.1) 

It  has  been  shown  that  the  entropy  of  low  density  monochromatic  gravitational 

waves, for the stabilization of the crystalline structure of vacuum space, varies with 

the volume in the same manner as the entropy of an ideal gas formed by particles.  

In other words, it has been shown that close enough to the big bang event the energy 
of  all  the  10120  gravitational  waves  (of  frequency  νOU)  which  stabilizes  the 

crystalline  vacuum  space  structure  behaves  thermodynamically  as  though  it 
consisted of a number nB = 1080 independent energy or matter quanta  of magnitude 
each (neutrons) uN = hνN = 1040 hνOU. 

3.2)  Equations (14) and (15) not only allow us to explain the low value of the starting of 

the  Universe  entropy  (as  requested  by  Penrose  [7]);  but  also  it  has  a  possible 

connection  with  expressions  for  the  entropy  of  black  holes.    Both  equations 

resemble an expression for the entropy of a black hole, SBH, due to Bekenstein [14] 

and Hawking [15] which if it is taken seriously [16] allows to exhibit that the first 

law of the thermodynamics dictates that black holes must have a temperature T, as 

follows 

d(MBH c2)  =  T dSBH   

 

 

(23) 

 

where MBH is the total mass of the black hole.  This equation could be expressed as

It is clear that Eqs. (14) and (15) used together with  Eq. (11) have  the same form 

and physical meaning of Eq. (18) and therefore the possibility exists that elementary 

particles could be conceptualized as a new kind of black hole.  This possibility will 

be studied in a following paper. 

3.3)  Relative to Eqs. (20) and (21) in our scheme neutrons and antineutrons are formed 

at  the  same  rate.      However  because  of  the  gravitational  stress  gradient  pattern 

existing around the source region, all the matter travels in one direction and all the 

antimatter travels in the opposite direction so there are no annihilation events during 

this stage.  Similar considerations about matter and antimatter productions processes 

have  been  used  before  by  other  authors  (see  Hawking  [17]  where  he  proposes  a 

mechanism for black-hole evaporation).  In our scheme, massive annihilation events 

between matter and antimatter will occur at the last stage of the expansion cycle of 

matter on the present fluctuation of the internal energy of the crystalline structure of 

vacuum space.  This point will be fully explained in a further paper. 

3.4) 

In nature crystals are never perfect, and it is well understood that they may contain 

many defects.  One of the most important is called a vacancy.  When vacancies  are 

introduced into the crystalline structure the internal energy of the crystal increases 

and  the  entropy  of  the  crystal  increases  too,  but  the  Gibbs  free  energy  diminishes 

until an equilibrium value is reached. 

In  our  case  the  situation  is  different  because  of  the  role  that  gravitation  forces  play  in 

relation to the crystalline structure of the vacuum cosmic space.  Equations (19) and (21) 

and  the  results  obtained  in  reference  [2],  allow  us  to  consider,  according  to  Boltzmann’s 

13

analysis [18], that the degraded energy of the crystalline vacuum cosmic space of volume 

VOU, which is in the most probable form of gravitational waves with frequency νOU, lead to 

mutual  gravitational  interactions  giving  place  to  a  “visible”  and  coordinate  motion  which 

behaves like heat of very high temperature that can be completely transformed into work.  

Not only EOU  =  ENF but all the energy EOU of gravitational compressed waves transforms 
into  matter  quanta  with  total  energy  ENF  =  1080Un.    This  situation  is  similar  to  the  one 

which  has  been  observed  in  plastic  deformation  [19]  where  coherent  elastic  waves 

generated  during  an  unloading  process,  travel  along  a  deformed  crystal  to  concentrate  at 

dislocation sources giving place to a full transformation of the energy of the elastic waves 

into  crystal  defects  called  dislocations.      In  other  word,  during  the  plastic  deformation 

process which occurs during an unloading test, energy in the form of coherent elastic sound 

waves, which have a very high entropy, give place to the production of dislocations (which 

have  a  very  low  configuration  entropy)  but  have  the  same  stored  elastic  energy  that  the 

original elastic waves. 

Additionally, if we take into account that gravitational long range cosmological stresses and 

quantum effective forces acting on the crystalline structure of vacuum do not appear in an 

explicit way in Eqs. (19) and (21) it is possible to arrive at an apparent paradoxical situation 

where Eqs. (19) and (21) refer not to an absolute minimum in the Gibbs’ free energy but to 

a relative minimum, due to the following reasons.  On the one hand, as already mentioned, 

in  the  case  of  Eq.  (19  the  gravitational  attraction  between  the  stabilization  gravitational 

waves provides a mechanism for the increases in the Gibbs’ free energy of the system and a 

decrease occur when such waves transforms into baryons the Gibbs’ free energy attaining 

its  initial  value,  Eq.  (21).    After  such  process  occurs,  the  dispersion  of  baryons  through 

crystalline vacuum space begins and the Gibbs’ free energy diminishes with the expansion 

until  matter  and  antimatter  (which  were  produced  in  the  neighboring  Universe  cell  and 

travel  in  opposite  sense  to  matter  facing  the  same  cosmic  gravitational  stress  gradient) 

“collides” and annihilate liberating the gravitational stored energy and leading to the rise of 

free energy to the level of EOU. 

 

 

 

14

On the other hand, from the physical situation existing previously to the fulfillment of Eq. 

(21)  we  have  a  transitory  “fire  ball”  which  decreases  in  radial  distance  and  increases  its 

temperature  as  the  last  stage  of  the  adiabatic  compression  process  proceeds  on  the 

gravitational  waves  which  stabilize  the  crystalline  structure  of  vacuum  space.  Such 

situation  is  characterized  by  a  very  high  grade  of  instability.  The  gravitational  energy  of 

such  waves  compressed  in  the  very  last  stage  of  the  adiabatic  process  before  mentioned 

causes a very high compressed matter quantum which produces huge expansion forces due 

to  the  uncertainty  principle,  giving  place  to  a  very  fast  inflation  of  the  structural 

components of  the very hot  gases  out  of thermal equilibrium. (The factor of such  sudden 
inflation,  which  will  be  explained  later,  is  1040).    This  physical  situation  correspond  to  a 
minimum entropy situation; see Eq. (16), which states that the starting entropy is about 10-
40 of the final entropy of the Universe. We consider that the situation here described is in 

agreement  with  Penrose’s  analysis  about  the  expected  thermodynamical  conditions  to  be 

fulfilled at the beginning of the expansion cycle [7].

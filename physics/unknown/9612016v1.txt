pare computer modeling with actual performance.

2 LEBT AND RFQ

LEBT had two pulsed solenoids, two sets of x and

y steerer, beam chopper, emittance probe, and two

current toroids. The chopper was removed from the

line, making the line shorter by 70 cm. Computer

modeling of this line showed that we should move the

1st solenoid as close to the ion source as possible to

reduce the beam size in the 1st solenoid and the second

solenoid as close to the RFQ as possible to increase the

convergence angle required by the RFQ acceptance.

Figure 1 shows the ion tra jectories through this line

and phase space at the exit of the ion source, middle of

the line and entrance of RFQ. The RFQ acceptance is

shown as a solid line ellipse. This calculation assumed

ing transmission through the RFQ was improved by

about 10 percent. Figure 2 shows the transmission as

a function of input beam current.

Shortening of the line resulted in lower measured

4 ALGEBRAIC

RECONSTRUCTION

TECHNIQUE (ART)

A radiograph of the beam at the BLIP target taken last

year showed a tilted ellipse in the x-y plane. Sources of

this coupling can be quad rotation or vertical o(cid:11)set in

the dipole. This triggered the need for an x-y density

pro(cid:12)le. We found that algebraic reconstruction tech-

nique (ART) could help us. ART was introduced by

Gordan, Bender and Herman [7] for solving the prob-

lem of three dimensional reconstruction from pro jec-

tions. The ART algorithms have a simple intuitive ba-

sis. Each pro jected density is thrown back across the

into agreement with the measured pro jection. The re-

construction space is an n x n array of small pixels, (cid:26)

the pixel but di(cid:11)erent from other pixels. Assume P

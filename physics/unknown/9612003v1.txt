We present the Witten and the double Darboux constructions as applied to the diﬀusion

of thermal neutrons from an inﬁnitely long line source.

Abstract

Supersymmetric one-dimensional quantum mechanics has been introduced in 1981 as a toy

model for symmetry-breaking phenomena in quantum ﬁeld theory [1]. With great speed its

status has changed to a powerful research discipline as one can contemplate in the most recent

review [2]. Recently, we obtained interesting results for various physical problems by using

Witten’s factorization and a more general supersymmetric double Darboux procedure [3].

The aim of this work is to apply the two supersymmetric methods to the theory of diﬀusion

of thermal neutrons. We shall use the illustrative example of the neutron diﬀusion problem as

presented in the textbook of Arfken [4]. The example is an ideal case in that it refers to an

inﬁnite line (Dirac delta) source of neutrons and actually provides the Green’s function for this

case. The steady state continuity equation for the neutrons is

D∇2φ − Σaφ + S = 0

(1)

where the ﬁrst term represents the diﬀusion, the second stands for the absorption losses and the

third is the source strength. The diﬀusion constant D is related to the neutron mean free path

as follows D =

3(1−2/3A) , where A is the atomic number of the scattering nucleus and enters as

λs

a correction for the anisotropy of scattering in the laboratory system. The solution φ has the

physical meaning of neutron ﬂux being the product of neutron density times average velocity.

Finally, Σa is the macroscopic absorption cross section, i.e., the product of the microscopic

(atomic) absorption cross section and the number of atoms per unit volume. Usually it is

assumed that the absorption is small compared to the scattering. As we said, the neutron

source is considered as an inﬁnitely long line source taken along the z-axis and embedded in

an inﬁnite diﬀusing medium. Its strength is S0 neutrons per unit length per unit time. Thus

S = S0δ(ρ) where δ(ρ) is the cylindrical Dirac delta function. One quickly gets the radial

diﬀusion equation

for ρ 6= 0. Using the “diﬀusion length” k−1 =

D/Σa one can write the general solution in

terms of the modiﬁed Bessel functions φ = a1I0(kρ) + a2K0(kρ). The physical solution contains

only the K0 term because the ﬂux decreases at large distances. The constant of integration a2

may be determined by requiring that D times the integral of the negative gradient of the neutron

ﬂux around the edge of a small pillbox of unit height be equal to the production strength S0

within the pillbox. The box is small (ρ → 0) to eliminate absorption and gives

[−∇K0(kρ) · ρ0]ρdθ

which is a two-dimensional form of Gauss’s law. Using the series form of K0(kρ) this turns into

or

for the ﬁnal form of the solution.

Let us pass now to the supersymmetric constructions. We have already presented these

schemes in previous papers. To perform such constructions one needs a self-adjoint form of the

showing indeed that superpositions of modiﬁed Bessel functions of zero order make up the

solution. Moreover, Eq. (6) can be interpreted as a Schr¨odinger equation at ﬁxed zero energy

with the potential VB(ρ) = k2 + 1

4ρ2 . As such, we can apply the single Darboux (or Witten)

construction, which is a factorization of Eq. (6) by means of the operators A1 = d

dρ + W (ρ)

and A2 = − d

dρ + W (ρ), where W is the so-called superpotential function. The latter can be

determined from the initial (or “bosonic”) Riccati equation VB = W 2−W

, or even more directly

′

as the negative of the logarithmic derivative of the ﬂux. The Witten construction means to pass

to a “fermionic” problem by merely changing the sign of the derivative term in the Riccati

equation and determine the new potential Vf,B, which is interpreted as a “fermionic” partner of

the initial potential. Thus, Vf,B = W 2 + W

′

. This partner potential enters a “fermionic” Bessel

equation for which the factoring operators are applied in reversed order. On the other hand, the

superpotential should be the negative of the logarithmic derivative of a “nodeless” solution and

moreover not to be singular because this would mean singularities in the partner potential. In

the case of neutron diﬀusion the “nodeless” condition is satisﬁed since modiﬁed Bessel functions

of zero order occur. As for the double Darboux construction in the supersymmetric framework, it

merely means using the general solution of the “bosonic” Riccati equation and not the particular

one as for the Witten construction. In this way one can introduce a one-parameter family of

“bosonic” potentials having the same “fermionic” partner, i.e.

Viso(ρ, ψ) = VB(ρ) −

there is a modulational damping of the general solution, which reads

Some plots of the strictly isospectral potentials and the isospectral neutron solutions ψ are

presented in Figures 1 and 2. The interesting point is that since the isospectral potential is ﬂux-

dependent the difusion equation changes from linear to a non-linear one. Practically, this means

ψ(ρ; λ) =

ψ(ρ)
I(ρ) + λ

that the material through which the neutrons are propagating has ﬂux-dependent properties.

Because the ﬂux dependence does not imply an energy dependence the isospectral nonlinearity

can be related only to the transient, nonstationary phase of the neutron diﬀusion [5].

In conclusion, one can say that we have displayed a double Darboux Green’s solution for

the thermal neutron diﬀusion. The interesting feature is that one can work with the general

solution, i.e., there is no need to select a priori a physical solution.

Abstract 

The  effects  of  a  pulsed 

low  frequency  electromagnetic  field  were 

investigated  on 

photoluminescence  of  well  characterized  water  and  prepared  under  controlled  conditions 

(container,  atmospheric,  electromagnetic,  and  acoustic  environments).  When  reference  water 

samples were excited at 260 nm, two wide emission bands centered at 345 nm (3.6 eV) and 425 

nm (2.9 eV) were observed. By contrast under 310 nm excitation, only one band appeared at 425 

nm.  Interestingly,  electromagnetic  treatment  (EMT)  induced,  at  both  excitation  wavelengths,  a 

decrease (around 70%)  in  the  425  nm band relative photoluminescence intensity. However, no 

difference  between  reference  and  treated  sample  was  observed  in  the  345  nm  band.  Other 

experiments,  performed  on  outgassed  samples  (reference  and  treated),  show  that  the  emission 

bands (position, shape, intensity) under excitation at 260 nm and 310 nm were similar and close 

to the corresponding bands of the treated nonoutgassed samples. Similar effects were observed 

on photoluminescence excitation of water samples. Two excitation bands monitored at 425 nm 

were  observed  at  272  nm  and  330  nm.  After  EMT  and/or  outgassing,  a  decrease  (>  60%)  was 

observed  in  the  intensity  of  these  two  bands.  Altogether,  these  results  indicate  that 

electromagnetic treatment and/or outgassing decrease in a similar fashion the photoluminescence 

intensity in water samples. They also suggest that this effect is most likely indirectly attributed to 

the presence of gas bubbles in water. The possible role of hydrated ionic shell around the bubbles 

in the observed extraluminescence is discussed.

Introduction 

The effect of static magnetic and electromagnetic fields (EMF) on water or on the behavior of 

aqueous solutions and suspensions has increasingly drawn the attention of investigators in recent 

years1-5.  For  instance,  it  has  been  shown  that  water  exhibits  changes  in  physicochemical 

properties in response to variations of field intensity and/or frequency4,5. The idea of a change in 

the structure of water itself, as a result of magnetic exposure has been criticized due to the low 

energy  from  the  used  field  intensities  in  comparison  with  the  one  from  thermal  agitation.  The 

situation is complicated by the fact that most of the effects studied depends on water composition 

and/or  environmental  conditions.  Although  the  precise  mechanisms  of  the  EMF  effect  has  not 

been yet fully elucidated, some theoretical and experimental considerations have suggested that 

EMF  act  via  a  colloid/water  interface6-8.  In  this  regard,  Colic  and  Morse6  working  with 

oscillating  radio-frequencies  EMF  on  colloids  in  water  proposed  that  the  electromagnetic 

treatment  (EMT)  effect  results  from  the  perturbation  of  the  gas/liquid  interface  and  that 

outgassing  removes  all  the  observed  effects  which  persist  for  hours  and  even  days  (Zeta 

potential, turbidity, …)9. This interface has been shown to play a key role in emulsion stability, 

cavitation, and biological reactivity10. Fesenko and Gluvstein11 treating triply distilled deionized 

water with microwaves suggested that the EMT might act on gas dissolved in water. Eberlein12 

proposed  a  quantum  vacuum  radiation  explanation  of  the  effect  based  on  the  influence  of  an 

oscillating EMF on the gas/water interface. According to her theory, a moving interface between 

media of different polarizability (water and bubbles) is a possible two-photon state source under 

the  excitation  by  the  electromagnetic  field13,14.  Other  studies15,16  showed  that  the  effect  of 

magnetic field on fluorescent probes is affected by the solvent nature and their environment. For 

instance, Higashitani et al.15 followed the fluorescence emission intensity of probes dissolved in 

3

water-ethanol mixtures exposed to a static magnetic field. The authors15 suggested that the static 

magnetic treatment altered the orientation of the water molecules around the alkyl chain of the 

fluorescent  probes  and  also  the  conformation  of  the  water  molecules,  ions,  hydrated  ions 

adsorbed on the particle surface. Chowdhury et al.16 showed that the magnetic field modulated 

exciplex luminescence in liquids. The exciplex luminescence depends on the liquid structure and 

the  environment,  such  as  viscosity,  dielectric  constant  of  the  medium  and  presence  of  other 

molecules in the neighborhood of the exciplex. 

In a previous work17, we have shown that the optical properties of highly purified water can be 

altered by the photoluminescence of traces impurities arising from container/content interactions. 

Therefore,  in  order  to  investigate  the  effects  of  pulsed  low  frequency  of  electromagnetic 

treatment  on  water  photoluminescence  (PL),  we  made  some  attempts  to  develop  new 

experimental conditions, in particular to minimize the release of compounds from the containers. 

For  instance,  glassware  was  made  of  pure  fused  optical  silica  and  water  was  purified  under 

controlled environmental conditions (atmospheric, electromagnetic and acoustic environments). 

In the experiments reported here, we show that electromagnetic treatment induces a modification 

in  the  relative  photoluminescence  intensity  of  the  water  samples.  We  will  discuss  the  possible 

mechanisms at the origin of this effect. 

1. Materials and methods 

1.1 Reagents 

Water  

 

 

The  water  used  in  the  experiments  described  below  was  freshly  prepared  with  Paris  tap  water 

(pressure  6  bar)  after  two  purification  steps  using:  (1)  an  inverse  osmosis  apparatus  (Rios  III, 

Millipore) that eliminates the molecules between 0.2 and 1 nm, 97% of the ionic substances as 

well  as  99%  of  the  organic  compounds;  (2)  a  final  polishing  apparatus  (Simplicity,  Millipore) 

4

equipped with an ultrafilter (Pyrogard D, size cutoff of 13 000 Da, Millipore) that eliminates the 

remaining  organic  compounds  ≥  5-10  nm.  At  the  end  of  the  procedure,  water  (purified  water) 

was  apyrogen  according  to  the  certificate  of  the  manufacturer  and  the  resistivity  was  18.2 

MΩ.cm at 25°C. 

Ethanol 

Spectroscopy grade ethanol (purity 0.999, UVASOL) purchased from Merck was used to clean 

the  glassware.  Moreover  in  order  to  minimize  the  fluctuations  the  residual  concentration  of 

organic compounds (≈ 0.05 ppm), a small amount of the same ethanol was added (≈ 0.95 ppm) 

during water preparation. According to the manufacturer, ultraviolet transmittance is superior or 

equal to 98% and 100% at 270 nm and 310 nm respectively. Importantly, at 254 nm and 365 nm 

wavelengths  respectively,  the  fluorescence  intensity  of  ethanol  is  inferior  or  equal  to  that  of  a 

quinine solution of 2 ppb and 1 ppb (or any other fluorescent compounds). 

Glassware 

All glassware were made of pure fused optical silica (Suprasil, Heraeus, and Hellma) in order to 

minimize  container/content  interaction17,18.  Optical  cells  (v:  3.5  ml,  section:  1cm2),  closed  also 

with  a  pure  fused  silica  cap,  were  purchased  from  Hellma  (QS  111).  Glassware  was  used 

specifically  and  only  for  the  study.  All  glassware  were  thoroughly  washed  with  ethanol  to 

remove any surface active material and then put in a clean oven at 80°C for 15 min. Just before 

use, the optical cells and Erlenmeyer 250 ml flask were rinsed with purified water. A specially 

designed glassware apparatus made of two compartments, a round beaker connected to an optical 

cell was used to outgassed water. 

Glove box 

The glove box was purchased from Jacomex (large-scale model: B003). In order to reconstitute 

atmospheric  air,  argon  (N56,  Air  Liquide),  carbon  dioxide  (N48,  Air  Liquide),  oxygen,  and 

nitrogen (Air N57 Pol, Air Liquide) were filtered through a 0.2 µm filter (Teflon Calyx Capsule, 

 

5

Osmonics) and then introduced into the glove box. A 3 mbar above the atmospheric pressure was 

maintained  in  order  to  avoid  outside  contamination.  Relative  humidity  (60  ±  2%)  and  carbon 

dioxide concentration (310 ± 20 ppm) were measured using a GM70 hand-held purchased from 

Vaisala (calibrated probe, humidity: HMP75 and carbon dioxide: GMP70). 

Insulated cages and storage boxes 

Two cylinder insulated cages (diameter 700 mm, 500 mm high) were designed and custom built. 

For  thermal  and  acoustic  insulation,  we  used  multi-layers  made  of  various  polymers  (EPDM, 

density:  8kg/m3,  20  mm  thick;  melamine  resin,  density:  11kg/m3,  20  mm  thick  and  bitumen 

mass, density 10kg/m3, 3 mm thick, Illbruck company). For magnetic insulation, we used a mu-

metal  double  foil,  1mm  thick  for  each  foil  (Mumetal,  Meca-Magnetic).  According  to  the 

manufacturer, magnetic field intensity (0.1 mT, ac, 50 Hz) is diminished by a factor of 850 (≈ 58 

dB). For grounding electric insulation (“Faraday cage”), copper foil (2 mm thick) was used. 

Two  storage  boxes  were  specially  designed,  composed  of  a  shielding  closed  cylinder  made  of 

mu-metal (diameter 80 mm, 105mm high, 2 mm thick) and placed in a Thermos® box. 

 

 

1.2 Water treatments 

 Electromagnetic treatment  

Optical cells containing purified water were placed in one of the two insulated cages and 

exposed  for  6  h  to  pulsed  (duration  30  s)  electromagnetic  fields  generated  by  a  solenoid  coil 

(diameter  50  mm,  80  mm  high,  copper  wire,  4367  turns/m,  self  inductance  L  =  3  mH,  ohmic 

resistance 3 Ω). The signal produced by a function generator (Agilent 33120A), consisted of 3 

successive  sinusoidal  signals  in  the  frequency  range  from  10  to  500  Hz.  Optical  cells  were 

placed  in  a  vertical  position  in  the  center  of  the  coil  supplied  by  a  250  mA  rms  current.  The 

calculated  r.m.s.  magnetic  field  density  at  the  center  of  the  coil  was  ≈  1  mT  and  according  to 

Faraday law, the maximum induced electric field was 4.1 mV/m. Control untreated (reference) 

6

optical cells were placed in the other insulated cage under the same conditions as exposed optical 

cells. After the period of EMT, optical cells [reference (R)/treated (T)] were transferred and kept 

into  separate  storage  boxes.  During  the  electromagnetic  treatment,  the  temperature  had  been 

monitored using a chromel/alumel thermocouple (∆ϑ was less than 0.01°C). 

Outgassing process 

To outgass purified water, the technique described by Pashley and co-workers19,20 which gives a 

degassing efficiency of ≈ 97% was used with a slight modification. A zeolithe pump instead of a 

water  jet  pump  aspirator  was  used  to  outgass  water  (20  min,  12  torr,  pressure  measured  by  a 

manometer C9555, Comark). At the end of pumping, outgassed water was transferred from the 

Suprasil  round  beaker  to  the  optical  cells  [outgassed  reference  water  (ROG)  and  outgassed 

treated water (TOG)]. Of note, under our experimental conditions, the glassware apparatus could 

not be entirely filled up to the top. 

1.3 Measurements 

Physicochemical water analysis 

The different measurements, using a multiparametric system (multimeter Consort C835, Fisher 

Scientific  )  were  always  done,  in  the  glove  box,  in  the  same  order:  conductivity/temperature, 

oxygen  concentration,  pH,  and  oxidation-reduction  potential  (ORP).  Data  values  from  the 

multimeter  were  recorded  on  a  computer.  For  conductivity  measurements,  the  apparatus  was 

equipped  with  a  specific  electrode  of  cell  constant  K=0.1  cm-1  for  low  ionic  concentration 

solutions with automatic temperature correction (Pt1000) and calibrated with two ionic strength 

solutions  (84  and  1413  µS.cm-1  at  25  °C,  Hanna  Instruments).  pH  measurements  were  done 

using a combined electrode (LL-Aquatrode, Metrohm) adapted for pure water. The electrode was 

calibrated  using  a  test  kit  buffer  (Scott-Geräte).  For  ORP  measurements,  we  used  a  combined 

electrode with platinum ring (N90417, Fisher Scientific) and for oxygen measurements, we used 

7

 

 

a  combined  electrode  oxygen/temperature  (N98338,  Fisher  Scientific).  The  ORP  probe  was 

calibrated using a redox solution of 470 mV (Pt-Ag/AgCl at 25°C, Scott-Geräte) and the oxygen 

probe  calibrated  with  100%  of  oxygen  content  in  air.  Analysis  of  Total  Organic  Compounds 

(TOC)  was  measured  by  an  A10  Monitor  (Anatel,  Millipore).  The  accuracy  was  15%  in  the 

range of 2-1000 ppb. 

Ambient magnetic fields (geomagnetic and environmental) analysis  

The dc and ac electric as well as magnetic fields were measured inside of the insulated 

cages  with  a  low  field  axial  probe  Mag  B,  positioned  at  60°,  connected  to  a  Mag-01H 

(Bartington Instruments Ltd) for the dc measurements. For ac analysis, measurements were done 

along three axes over a frequency range of 5 Hz to 400 kHz with the probe of apparatus Esm-100 

(Maschek) placed close to the exposure area. In the absence of current, the fields in the solenoid 

coil were: static magnetic field 9.9 µT, ac magnetic field (in the range 5 Hz to 400 kHz) 16 nT, 

ac  residual  electric  field  (mainly  50  Hz,  isotropric)  6.3  V/m.  Of  note,  the  applied  pulsed 

magnetic field (1 mT), was far above the environmental magnetic fields both ac (16 nT) and dc 

(less 10 µT). The maximum induced electric field produced by the applied electromagnetic field, 

4.1 mV/m, is very weak compared to the environmental electric field (few V/m). 

 

1.4. 

Photoluminescence analysis 

Emitted  light  from  the  sample  was  recorded  at  right  angle  of  the  excitation  beam,  on  a 

Fluorolog3-2-Triax  spectrofluorometer  (Jobin  Yvon).  The  light  source  was  a  xenon  lamp  (450 

W) operating in a wavelength range of 240 to 850 nm. The excitation wavelength was selected 

by a double monochromator (gratings 330 blaze, 1200 grooves/mm, dispersion: 2.1 nm/mm). A 

Triax  320  spectrometer  was  used  to  analyze  the  emission  spectra.  It  is  equipped  with  a 

monochromator  (grating  750nm  blaze,  600  grooves/mm)  and  a  photomultiplier  Hamamatsu 

R928. The spectra were corrected from the source fluctuations. Two excitation wavelengths (260 

 

8

and 310 nm) were chosen in order to compare our results with Lobyshev’s21. We will see further 

that they are close to the optimal excitation wavelengths. For the 260 nm wavelength (40 mW 

power) and 310 nm (190 mW power), the explored emission wavelength ranged from 270 nm to 

500 nm and 325 nm to 600 nm, respectively. In the excitation spectra experiments, the excitation 

spectra ranged from 240 to 330 nm and 240 to 410 nm, respectively, according to the emission 

wavelength  monitored  at  345  nm  and  425  nm,  respectively.  For  both  excitation  and  emission 

spectra, resolution of the PL spectrum was 5 nm with an increment of 1 nm and an acquisition 

time  of  1s  per  increment.  In  a  preliminary  work,  we  noticed,  in  agreement  with  Lobyshev’s 

observations21, an increase in the PL intensity of our reference samples as a function of time. We 

also  observed  that  EMT  samples  presented  over  time  the  same  behavior  but  with  a  slower 

increase in the PL intensity. In order to maximize the differential effect, we decided to present 

here  the  experimental  results  obtained  three  weeks  after  sample  preparation  and  treatment.  Of 

note, during the period, each sample was kept in individual storage box. 

Results  

 

 

 

We standardized on a common experimental procedure and used the same exposure device in all 

the tests we performed (Fig. 1). In brief, all glassware was made of purified fused silica; water 

was purified and samples prepared inside a glove box under a controlled atmosphere. In order to 

have  a  good  homogeneity  among  different  samples,  water  coming  from  the  “Simplicity 

apparatus” was stored for 25 min in a closed Erlenmeyer flask. Then, water was quickly poured 

into  the  optical  cells  and  filled  to  the  top.  Optical  cells  were  closed  and  sealed  with  a  silica 

ground cap. During this period, an aliquot sample was taken and analyzed for physicochemical 

measurements.  All  control  (reference)  and  treated  water  samples  were  made  of  purified  water 

9

having  the  following  characteristics:  resistivity  4.0  MΩ.cm  at  25°C,  TOC  content:  ≈  1  ppm 

(mainly ethanol), pH: 5.9, redox potential: 280 mV, oxygen content: 2 ppm.  

We first investigated the effect of a 6 h pulsed low frequency electromagnetic treatment on water 

using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Of note, the intensity of the Raman peak for each couple 

(reference  and  treated  samples)  remains  constant.  In  order  to  compare  results  between 

experiments,  each  spectrum  was  normalized  to  the  maximal  values  of  the  Raman.  Figure  2 

depicted the emission spectra of water samples excited at a wavelength of 260 nm (panel A) and 

310 nm (panel B). Wide structureless bands centered at 345 nm (3.6 eV) and 425 nm (2.90 eV) 

and  only  one  band  at  425  nm  were  observed  for  260  and  310  nm  excitation  wavelengths 

respectively. Of note, in the reference samples (R), the amplitude of the 425 nm emission band in 

reference samples decreases by about 50% when excited at 310 nm as compared to 260 nm. The 

full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 425 nm band (excited at both wavelengths) is ≈ 55 

nm. Interestingly, after electromagnetic treatment (T), we noted, at both excitation wavelengths, 

a striking decrease (around 70%) of the 425 nm band. By contrast, no variation between R and T 

samples  was  seen  in  the  345  nm  band.  Other  experiments  (Fig.  3),  performed  with  outgassed 

samples (ROG, TOG), show that the emission bands (position, shape, intensity) under excitation 

at  260  nm  (panel  A)  and  310  nm  (panel  B)  were  very  similar  and  close  to  the  corresponding 

bands  of  the  treated  nonoutgassed  samples  (Fig.  2).  Altogether,  these  results  indicate  that 

electromagnetic  treatment  or  outgassing  decrease  in  a  similar  manner  the  photoluminescence 

intensity of water. 

The  photoluminescence  excitation  (PLE)  of  water  samples  was  next  studied.  As  before,  each 

spectrum  was  normalized  to  the  maximal  values  of  the  excitation  band  corresponding  to  the 

Raman peak. Figure 4 shows the excitation spectra of samples R and T (panel A) and ROG and 

TOG (panel B) monitored at 345 nm. One wide band of low intensity was observed around 280 

nm. The pattern of the excitation spectra was roughly similar for each couple (R vs T) and (ROG 

 

10

vs  TOG).  This  latter  result  was  not  surprising  if  one  considers  the  similarity  of  the  emission 

bands around 345 nm (excited at 260 nm) for each couple. By contrast and as illustrated in Fig. 

5, when monitored at 425 nm, two excitation bands peaking at 272 and 330 nm were present. Of 

note, the PL 425 nm band did not present mirror symmetry with the excitation bands at 272 and 

330  nm.  Interestingly,  after  EMT  or  outgassing,  a  65%  relative  decrease  was  observed  in  the 

PLE intensity of these two bands. Of note, the larger stokes shift around 150 nm (13 235 cm-1) 

may suggest a reorganization of the whole electronically excited molecules before the emission 

takes place22.These results again indicate that electromagnetic treatment or outgassing decrease 

in a similar fashion the PLE intensity of water.  

Discussion  

The  intensity  of  the  425  nm  emission  band  observed  in  reference  water  samples  could  not  be 

merely  attributed  to  impurities  alone  coming  either  from  the  container/content  interaction  or 

simply present in water since: (i) all glassware were made of pure fused optical silica; (ii) the 1 

ppm  spectroscopy  grade  ethanol  present  in  water  did  not  interfere  with  the  ultraviolet 

transmittance  at  310  nm  wavelength  (see  1.1).  (iii)  the  water  purification  process  (inverse 

osmosis plus Simplicity apparatus equipped with a Pyroguard ultrafilter) guarantees the lowest 

amount  of  impurities.  In  addition,  the  water  used  in  the  experiments  was  purified  under 

controlled  environmental  conditions  and  always  displays 

the  same  physicochemical 

characteristics (Fig. 1). Interestingly, our data also indicate that outgassing decreased (by about 

70%) the photoluminescence intensity in the reference samples. The latter data also pointed out 

the role of gas bubbles in the observed effect. We would emphasize, however, that it is difficult 

to  formally  rule  out  at  present  ,  the  possibility  that  trace  amount  of  residual  impurities  in  our 

 

 

 

11

samples may have contributed to the 5-9% relative emission intensity, observed after either EMT 

or outgassing (Fig. 3).  

 

 

The  precise  origin  of  the  70%  “extra-photoluminescence”  intensity    remains  a  puzzling 

and  open  question.  Although  this  point  cannot  be  resolved  at  the  present  time,  at  least  two 

possibilities can be readily envisioned. For example, it is conceivable that the 425 nm emission 

spectrum  of  the  reference  samples  might  be  due  to  intrinsic  photoluminescence  of  water,  as 

proposed  by  Lobyshev  et  al.21.  An  alternative  view  is  to  assign  the  origin  of  the  extra-

photoluminescence  intensity  to  trace  amount  of  impurities  adsorbed  at  the  bubble/water 

interface.  We 

favor 

the 

latter 

interpretation  since,  outgassing  water  decreases 

the 

photoluminescence intensity (by about 70%) in the water samples. In addition, we have recently 

identified  using  dynamic  light  scattering,  the  presence  of  gas  nanobubbles  (around  300  nm)  in 

non-outgassed water samples, that partially vanished under the action of EMT (Ph. Vallée et al., 

Langmuir 2005, in press). Furthermore, our experimental conditions to prepare purified water are 

very close to a compression-expansion cycle: relative high pressure (6 bar) at the entrance of the 

inverse osmosis apparatus and low pressure (1 bar) at the exit of Simplicity apparatus. A state of 

gas  supersaturation  is  therefore  reached  by  the  water,  which  may  lead  to  the  formation  of  gas 

bubbles in our samples, stable over a long period of time, since our cells are filled to the brim 

and  hermetically  sealed.  In  support  of  this  notion,  Bunkin  and  co-workers23-27  working  on 

cavitation of gas bubbles in liquids, suggested that gas nanobubbles occur and are stabilized by a 

shell of negative ions present in the water, even when ion concentration is  as  low as 0.1 ppm. 

Indeed, such concentration can be found in our water samples, due to (i) water autodissociation 

(OH-  ions)28;  (ii)  carbon  dioxide  gas  present  in  water,  indeed,  resistivity  (4.0  MΩ.cm)  and  pH 

(5.9) measurements before closing the optical cells correspond to a HCO3

- content of ≈ 0.1 ppm; 

(iii) a release of trace silica ions from the optical cell during the storage.  

12

An interesting finding that became apparent during these studies, is that electromagnetic 

treatment of water yields nearly similar results as outgassing. In experiments close to ours, on an 

aqueous  electrolyte  solution,  Beruto  et  al.29  showed  that  low  frequency  electromagnetic  fields 

(250 µT, square pulsed fields at 75 Hz), have the same effect (vaporization of carbon dioxide) as 

outgassing.  As  a  consequence,  ionic  concentration  decreases  in  the  solution  and  tends  to 

neutralize  the  interfacial  area.  Similarly,  our  pulsed  low  frequency  electromagnetic  treatment 

could  act  on  the  bubble/water  interface  leading  to  destabilization  of  bubbles,  in  particular  by 

disturbing the ionic balance between the shell of adsorbed negative ions and counter ions. Others 

authors  (Gamayunov30  and  Lipus31)  envision  the  action  of  EMF  directly  on  the  ionic 

doublelayer.  Along  this  line,  Gamayunov  et  al.30  show  that  the  Lorentz  force  causes  a  local 

deformation of the electrical double-layer particles or air bubbles of various sizes resulting into 

the coalescence of the gas bubbles, when they are carried by the liquid in a static magnetic field 

(around 75 mT). Furthermore, Lipus et al.31 also explained the effect of static magnetic treatment 

(intensity  range  0.05  –  1  T)  on  the  dispersion  of  particles  or  bubbles  in  water  by  the  Lorentz 

force which induces the shift of counterions from the Gouy-Chapman into the Stern layer.  

Let  us  now  consider  different  hypotheses  regarding  the  relationships  between  the 

decrease in PL intensity and the disappearance of gas bubbles. Most of them are related to the 

electric charge density of ionic compounds present at the bubble/water interface which has been 

shown  to  play  a  crucial  role  in  colloids,  beginning  with  Hofmeister  works32,33.  Indeed,  the 

molecular  interactions  occurring  in  the  ionic  shell  present  at  the  bubble  surface  could  produce 

collective electronic effects being thus possibly at the origin of the observed PL. This effect has 

been  also  observed  in  solid  compounds.  Su  and  Guo34  explained  the  PL  intensity  changes 

observed in hydrogenated amorphous silicon oxide powder by the modification of the electronic 

density of states of silicon due to defects and variations of the local environment. By the same 

token,  the  analysis  of  various  published  data35,36  shows  that  a  photoluminescence  band  around 

 

13

410 nm excited at 337 nm is ascribable to the presence of defects (like Si ions) in silica samples. 

Our results concerning the emission band of water samples around 425 nm when excited at 310 

nm  (optimally  at  330  nm)  may  relate  to  previous  observations  that  ascribe  a  key  role  of  silica 

ions adsorbed on bubbles. Even if there is a low release of silica ions after a long-term storage in 

silica  cells,  these  ions  can  be  adsorbed  preferentially  on  the  bubble/water  interface,  thus 

increasing  the  electric  charge  density  that  might  contribute  to  photoluminescence.  Ionized 

ethanol molecules preferentially adsorbed at the bubble/water interface may act in the same way 

by inducing a greater charge density at the bubble surface. 

As  discussed  above,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  extra-photoluminescence  intensity  observed  may  be 

due  to  the  intrinsic  photoluminescence  of  the  ethanol  molecule  alone.  Nevertheless,  due  to  the 

ethanol behavior as proton trap37-39, a proton transfer between residual organic compounds and 

hydrated OH groups of the ethanol, both at the bubble/water interface may occur and contribute 

to the observed extra-photoluminescence intensity in reference samples. The proton transfer rate 

can vary with the solvent composition due to the variation of its dielectric properties. Along this 

line,  Chowdhury16  showed  that  variations  of  the  luminescence  of  exciplex  depends  on  the 

structure of the liquid and on the dielectric constant of the solvent. Moreover, Lepoint-Mullie et 

al.40 following the Gouy-Chapman model, infer that the dielectric constant of water is decreasing 

when approaching the surface of bubbles.  

 

 

 

4. Conclusions 

Several points emerge from this study:  

(i) 

A  thorough  process  of  water  sample  preparation  and  characterization  to  measure  the 

action of pulsed low frequency electromagnetic fields on photoluminescence of purified 

water was developed. 

14

(ii) 

Under 260 nm excitation wavelength, two wide structure-less photoluminescence bands 

at 345 nm and at 425 nm were observed, while only one band at 425 nm appeared under 

(iii)  After  electromagnetic  treatment  and/or  outgassing,  the  425  nm  band  emission  intensity 

310 nm excitation.  

decreases sharply (around 70%). 

(iv)  When the PLE spectra was monitored at 425 nm, two excitation bands peaking at 272 nm 

and 330 nm were observed. After EMT and/or outgassing, a decrease (around 65%) was 

observed in the PLE intensity. 

(v) 

Among  these  different  models  discussed  above,  we  favor,  at  the  present  time,  the 

possibility  that  the  70%  extra-photoluminescence  intensity  observed  may  be  due  to  the 

electronic  charge  density  induced  by  the  concentration  of  hydrated  ionic  compounds 

around gas bubbles, on which electromagnetic treatment acts. Clearly, further studies will 

be necessary to directly address these issues. 

These  results  may  open  interesting  perspectives  in  biology,  notably  via  the  role  of  the  ionic 

double layer41,42.

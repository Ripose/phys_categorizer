Abstract.  The  wakefields  of  a  relativistic  electron  beam  passing  through  a  waveguide  loaded 
with an active medium with weak resonant dispersion have been considered. For the calculations 
in this paper the parameters of the medium are those of a solution of fullerene (C60) in a nematic 
liquid  crystal  that  exhibits  activity  in  the  X-band  [4].    It  was  shown  that  several  of  the  TM 
accelerating modes can be amplified for the geometries under consideration; structures in which 
higher  order  modes  are  amplified  exhibit  essential  advantages  as  PASERs.    In  particular,  the 
amplification of the highest mode occurs in a structure loaded with a rather thick active medium 
layer that maximizes the energy stored by the active medium.  

Keywords:  active  medium,  wakefield,  Cherenkov  radiation,  waveguide,  resonant  dispersion,

INTRODUCTION 

The possibility of using an active medium to amplify the generated wakefield of a 
beam  and  employing  the  amplified  wakefield  to  accelerate  a  second  beam  has  been 
recognized  recently.    This  acceleration  scheme  is  one  of  several  related  methods 
referred  to  as  Particle  Acceleration  by  Stimulated  Emission  of  Radiation  (PASER), 
where  an  active  medium  is  used  to  provide  the  energy  for  accelerating  charged 
particles.  Initial theoretical work in this area focused on acceleration in gaseous CO2 
and ammonia  laser  media [1, 2].  Recently  a new active  material operating  in the X-
band  has  been  proposed:  a  solution  of  fullerene  (C60)  in  a  nematic  liquid  crystal  has 
been  found  to  exhibit  a  maser  transition  in  the  X-band  frequency  range  [3,  4].   The 
ability  to  employ  a  microwave  frequency  material  simplifies  the  construction  of  test 
structures  and  facilitates  beam  experiments  using  Dielectric  Loaded  Accelerator 
(DLA) concepts [4].  

We  present  here  the  results  of  analytical  and  numerical  studies  of  the  Cherenkov 
radiation  from  a  Gaussian  electron  bunch  moving  through  an  accelerating  structure 
loaded with an active medium.  The analysis of the problem is based on the waveguide 
mode  formalism applied to a resonant dispersive  medium excited  by  external optical 
pumping.  The theory of Cherenkov radiation  in  waveguides  loaded with a dielectric 
medium  was  outlined  previously  in  variety  of  publications  (see,  for  example,  the 
review  article  [5]).    However,  Cherenkov  radiation  in  waveguides  with  dispersive 

media  (passive  or  active)  has  not  been  extensively  discussed  in  the  literature.    For 
example,  in  Ref.  [6]  the  frequency  dependence  of  the  conductivity  is  taken  into 
account.    Some  papers  are  devoted  to  the  investigation  of  radiation  in  a  waveguide 
completely  or  partly  filled  with  a  passive  dielectric  exhibiting  resonant  dispersion 
[7,8].  The case of an active medium with strong resonant dispersion is considered in 
the paper [1].  Further expansion of the theory can be found in Ref. [2].

The common results  for the analogous problem  with a passive dispersive  medium 
were  included,  for  example,  in  Ref.  [5].    It  can  be  shown  that  these  results  may  be 
generalized for the case of an active medium.  We obtain the following expression for

THE CASE OF WEAK RESONANT DISPERSION  

 The results (1) – (3) are true both for passive and for active medium with arbitrary 
dispersion characteristics.  We consider here a typical case when the dispersion has a 
resonant character and there is only one resonant frequency in the range of interest for 

us.  In this case the refractive index has the form

the vicinity of the resonance  but is anomalous  in  the neighborhood of the resonance.  
In the  second (active) case the dispersion  is anomalous almost everywhere except  in 
the resonance vicinity and is normal in the resonance vicinity where the imaginary part

The basic thrust of this paper is the analysis of the active medium case, where the 
dispersion is relatively weak and energy losses are relatively small (the opposite case 
of  strong  dispersion  was  analyzed  in  [1,  2]).    These  conditions  are  fulfilled  if  the

In  the  low  GHz-frequency  range,  an  example  of  an  active  medium  with  weak 
dispersion is a solution of fullerene (C60) in a liquid crystal under optical pumping and 
an  external  dc  magnetic  field.    This  medium  has  been  discussed  as  a  possible 
"amplifier" for electromagnetic fields in Refs. [3,4].  In this medium, the amplification 
process  is  determined  by  the  magnetic  permeability.    The  dielectric  permittivity  is 
nearly constant and its imaginary part determines the dielectric losses of the structure.

We  next  describe  some  numerical  results 
for  the  case  of  an  ultra-relativistic  beam 
γ=
(
).  First we consider the 
case  of  a  relatively  thin  waveguide  with  a 
radius  of  2  cm  to  allow  the  demonstration  of 
the  single  mode  amplification  regime  for  the 
TM  mode.  Fig. 3 shows the dependence of 
the  imaginary  and  real  parts  of  the  frequency 
on  the  channel  radius  for  different  values  of 
Imν , only the region of positive 
the imaginary part of the permittivity.  Note that for
magnitudes  is  shown.  We observe that the  maximum  amplification and the range of 
channel radii where the amplification takes place decrease as the imaginary part of the 
permittivity increases. However this decrease is not very significant when

Next we consider the case of relatively thick waveguide with a=10 cm, in which the 
amplification regime for several modes can be found.  As we see from Fig. 5, one can 
obtain  the  amplification  of  the  modes  with  numbers  from  1  to  6  depending  on  the 
Imω  depend on  m  rather weakly, and one 
channel radius.  The maximum values of 
can  use  a  set  of  modes  for  wakefield  amplification.    Meanwhile  the  amplification 
regime  for  a  single  mode  occurs  only  for  the  case  of  a  very  thin  layer  of  active 
medium.    The  amplification  is  very  sensitive  to  the  geometric  parameters  of  the 
structure (see curve 1 in Fig. 5 which is rather narrow).  The amplification regime for 
the higher modes occurs in structures with thicker active medium layer.  The thickest 
active  medium  layer  corresponds  to  amplification  of  the  6th  mode.    This  has  the 
important advantage that the  increased  volume of active  medium  stores  more energy 
inside the structure.  The amplification of the higher modes is also not very sensitive 
to the exact choice of channel radius (the curve for the 6th mode is rather wide).

Figure  6  shows  the  wakefields  in  the  case  of  maximum  amplification  of  the  1,  4, 
and  6  modes.    The  channel  radii  and  e-folding  amplification  distances  of  the 
corresponding  modes  are  indicated.  The  right  hand  plot  in  Fig.  6  gives  the 
0=ζ .  The single-mode wakefield is excited in 
corresponding spectra at the distance 
the case of a very thin medium layer.  In the other cases the wakefields are multimode.

CONCLUSION 

In  this  paper  a  general  analysis  of  the  amplification  of  wakefields  in  cylindrical 
structures  by  weakly  dispersive  active  media  is  presented.    The  wakefields  are 
generated  by  a  relativistic  electron  beam  passing  through  an  accelerating  structure 
loaded  with  an  active  dielectric  medium  [1,2,4].    The  parameters  of  the  recently 
studied active solution of fullerene (C60) in a nematic liquid crystal operating in the X-
band [4] have been assumed for these calculations.  It was shown that in the case of a 
medium with weak dispersion the amplification effect is determined by the imaginary 
part  of  the  refractive  index.    In  contrast  to  this,  for the  case  of  medium  with  strong 
dispersion  the  amplification  effect  is  determined  by  the  anomalous  character  of  the 
dispersion  and  the  contribution  of  the  imaginary  part  of  refractive  index  was  less 
significant [1,2]. The amplification of several  modes  has  been demonstrated, and the 
dependence  of  the  maximum  increment  on  the  mode  number  was  found  to  be 
relatively small.  The waveguide geometry determines the amplification conditions for 
a  given  mode.    The  amplification  of  higher  order  modes  exhibits  noticeable 
advantages:  (1)  amplification  of  the  higher  modes  occurs  when  an  electron  beam 
traverses a structure loaded with a thick active medium layer and hence more energy is 
available from the medium; (2) the dependence of the amplification magnitude on the 
geometrical parameters of the structure for the higher modes is not very strong; (3) as 
a rule, the excitation of the highest amplified mode is rather effective.

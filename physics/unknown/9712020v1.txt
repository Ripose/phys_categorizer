We  report  the  self-assembly  of  thin  actin  shells  beneath  the  membranes  of  giant

vesicles.  Ion-carrier  mediated  influx  of  Mg2+  induces  actin  polymerization  in  the

initially  spherical  vesicles.  Buckling  of  the  vesicles  and  the  formation  of  blisters

after  thermally  induced  bilayer  expansion  is  demonstrated.  Bilayer  flickering  is

dominated  by  tension  generated  by  its  coupling  to  the  actin  cortex.  Quantitative

flicker  analysis  suggests  the  bilayer  and  the  actin  cortex  are  separated  by  0.4  µm

to  0.5  µm  due  to  undulation  forces.

The  viscoelastic  properties  of  plasma  membranes  of  eukaryotic  cells  are  determined  by  the

coupling of two soft shells: the lipid-protein bilayer and the membrane associated cytoskeleton.

The latter may consist of a two-dimensional meshwork as in the case of red blood cells or of a

several hundred nm thick shell (called actin cortex) composed mainly of actin and associated mani-

pulation proteins (including crosslinking-, severing- and motor proteins) as in leucocytes or as in

the amoeba such as the cells of the slime mold Dictyostelium  discoideum (cf. [1, 2, 3]). Many

biological  processes  are  associated  with  cellular  shape  changes,  such  as  cell  locomotion  or

phagocytosis, and are controlled by a complex interplay of the two soft shells of the composite cell

envelope. The elastic moduli of the actin cortex may be varied in two ways: (i) by the degree of

crosslinking  within  the  network  and  (ii)  by  its  coupling  strength  to  the  lipid-protein  bilayer.

Moreover it can be actively deformed by motor proteins.

In the present work we report the reconstitution of thin actin shells in giant vesicles by self-

assembly during polymerization of monomeric actin through (ion-carrier mediated) Mg2+-influx

into spherical vesicles. The actin cortex is visualized by microfluorescence using laser scanning

confocal microscopy (LSCM). Buckling-like shape changes [4] are observed by phase contrast

microscopy (PCM) after thermal expansion of the bilayer excess area.

Giant vesicles were prepared by swelling in an electric field [5,6] of thin lipid layers (DMPC [7]

and  5  mole  %  of  the  ion  carrier  A23187  [8])  deposited  onto  ITO  glass  electrodes  [9]  in  the

presence of monomeric actin (G-actin) [10] and in non-polymerizing buffer (Gx-buffer [11]). For

the LSCM experiments, vesicles were swollen in Gx-buffer containing 63 mOsm glucose and 4

µM rhodaminyl phalloidin [12]. The vesicles were diluted into Gx-buffer containing isoosmolar

sucrose  in  order  to  reduce  the  extravesicular  G-actin  below  the  critical  concentration  of

polymerization [10]. Polymerization of the actin inside the vesicles was then started by addition of

2 mM of Mg2+. For some experiments the actin outside the vesicles was inactivated by adding

isomolar DNase I [8]. During polymerization the vesicles were kept spherical by temperature

controlled adjustment of the area-to-volume ratio. For observation the vesicles were transferred

into a temperature controlled observation chamber in which they could be observed either by PCM

(Zeiss Axiomat 10) or by LSCM (Axiovert 100 TV, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany and Noran

Odyssey XL, Noran, Middleton, WI, USA). For LSCM an objective plan apochromat 63x/1.4 oil

W. Häckl, M. Bärmann and E. Sackmann: Shape Changes of Self-Assembled Actin Bilayer Composite Membranes

and for PCM an objective plan-neofluar 40x/0.75 (both Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) were used.

The slit width for LSCM was 15 µm. Image processing for PCM occured with the setup described

in  [13]  and  the  NIH  image  program  [14]  with  the  modification  VETRAL  [15].  All  other

computations were done with the computer program IGOR[16].

Fig. 1a shows LSCM micrographs taken parallel to horizontal sections through a DMPC vesicle

containing polymerized actin. Fig. 1b exhibits the fluorescence intensity distributions along a line

through  the  equatorial  plane  before  (a)  and  after  (b)  polymerization.  Clearly  the  actin  is

accumulated near the membrane after polymerisation forming a thin fluorescent shell of about

1 µm thickness. The formation of the actin cortex could also be monitored by characteristic shape

changes of vesicles exhibiting excess bilayer area before polymerization. The originally flaccid and

strongly  flickering  vesicles  show  buckling  shape  changes  (similar  to  Fig.  2)  within  about  30

minutes after starting the polymerization.

Fig. 2a shows typical shape changes of a vesicle containing polymerized actin caused by thermal

expansion of the bilayer. First the vesicle undergoes a buckling transition (cf. images a and b).

This is reversible for small temperature increases of about 5 °C. During further heating a few or

sometimes only one protrusions are formed which may consist of rounded blisters (cf. Fig 2a

image c and d), cone-shaped protrusion (cf. Fig 2b image b), tubular protrusions (cf. Fig. 2b

image d) and spherical buds connected with the mother vesicle by a neck (image not shown). The

irreversible protrusions are stable for hours. The formation of only a small number of protrusions

indicates that the excess area formed isotropically on the vesicle surface can slide over the cortex.

The protrusions may be partially stabilized by growing in of polymerized actin due to long time

changes of the filament lengths.

About 10 % of the vesicles (such as that of Fig. 2) exhibit strong enough flickering in the quasi-

spherical shape to be analysed by flicker spectroscopy [6]. Judged from previous studies [6] this

is most likely due to the lateral tension generated by microbud formation. The flickering of the

majority of the vesicles is, however, large enough to measure the mean square amplitudes

of the fluctuating membrane along the contour (cf. Fig. 3b). The bending modulus kc and the

membrane tension s

 of the strongly flickering vesicles are determined by Fourier analysis of the

analysis one can still estimate the mean square amplitude as a function of the azimuth angle of the

contour (cf. Fig 3b).

The self-assembly of a thin shell of polymerized actin in a spherical vesicle can be understood in

terms of the minimization of the bending energy of the semiflexible actin filaments. Actin poly-

merization in vitro leads to long filaments of average contour length  L @

m20   m  [20] which is

comparable to the radius of the vesicle studied. The average bending energy of a very thin shell of

actin (with thickness  d

where B is the filament bending modulus (dimension Jm). This equation is valid as long as the

vesicle  diameter  is  of  simular  size  of  or  larger  than  the  persistance  length  of  the  filaments,

L p

m2   m [20b]. The total bending energy  GB  decreases as the radius of the shell increases,

which is in contrast to the bending energy of the bilayer shell [21].

An important question is whether the flickering of the composite shell is determined by the undu-

lations of the bilayer alone or of the whole shell. The following considerations favour the former

possibility.

The effective bending modulus of a thin layer of  N F  randomly oriented filaments of length L is of

the order  k

9 10 18 J which is over an order

of magnitude larger than the kc-value measured (cf. fig. 3a), strongly suggesting that the actin

cortex and the bilayer are decoupled. Further evidence for this comes from the finding that the

bilayer can freely slide over the actin shell during the formation of blisters or buds after prolonged

annealing. The distance  h  between the bilayer and the actin shell is below the optical resolution.

h  can be estimated by assuming that it is determined by the disjoining pressure by the bilayer

undulation. In this case it is  v

Another estimation of  h   is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  undulation-induced  disjoining

pressure, Pund, is balanced by the pressure PA, exerted by the cortex towards the outside of the

vesicle (Pund=PA). The analysis of Fig. 3a shows that the disjoining pressure is dominated by the

For a vesicle of R = 10 µm and cA = 2 µM (of fig. 2b images a and b) the pressure exerted by the

actin cortex (with the single filament bending stiffness B = 4.10-26 Jm) is of the order of PA=

4.5.10-6 Jm-3. It would be just balanced by the undulation pressure at a distance  h = 0 4.

m m for

 = 3.10-7 Jm-2 (cf. Fig. 3a), in good agreement with the above value obtained by flicker analysis.

The self-assembly of a thin actin shell in giant vesicles exhibiting diameters comparable to the

persistence length of the filaments is a consequence of the semiflexible nature of actin. Even if the

actin is polymerized in large deflated vesicles they form quasi spherical shells while the excess bi-

layer area is transformed into buds which eventually detach (images not shown). We do not find

tube like shapes unless the vesicles are small ( R < 0 1.

  m m).  Such  shapes  have  been  found  for

large  vesicles  if  the  polymerization  was  performed  with  very  high  actin  concentrations  and

completely different polymerization conditions [24]. Recent studies by cryo electron microscopy

(EM) and reconstruction of the actin-bilayer shells by EM-tomography [25] show that elongated

vesicles are favoured with small radii  R » 0 1.

  m m.

The behaviour of the semiflexible actin in giant vesicles is strikingly different from that of mi-

crotubuli which form long protrusion if excess area is provided but which form also rings if the

vesicle is under high tension [26].

The selfassembly of actin cortices in giant vesicles is a first step towards the design of more

realistic models of cell plasma membranes. The composite shells exhibit shape changes such as

buckling and (multiple) blister formation which are not found for pure lipid vesicles [27] but

which are typical for cells. The buckling may be caused by the arrangement of actin into domains

of  parallel  aligned  filaments  with  the  domain  walls  forming  flexible  hinges.  This  is  indeed

suggested by freeze fracture EM (unpublished results of authors‘ laboratory).

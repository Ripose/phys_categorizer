Abstract.  The  relativistic  addition  of  parallel  velocities  is  derived 
involving relativity only via the time dilation formula, avoiding the 
length  contraction  used  by  many  authors  in  conjunction  with  time 
dilation.  The  followed  scenario  involves  a  machine  gun  that  fires 
successive bullets, considered from its rest frame and from the rest 
frame of the target, the bullets hit. 
 
Derivations  of  the  formula  for  the  relativistic  addition  of 
 
parallel velocities (RAPV) without using the Lorentz transformations 
are  known.  Some  of  them1,2,3  derive  the  RAPV  using  both  Lorentz 
contraction  and  time  dilation.  Peres4  presents  a  derivation  of  the 
RAPV based on the relativistic Doppler formula using light signals as 
detected by three inertial observers, one of which is at rest relative 
to  the  light  source  that  emits  the  successive  light  signals  at 
constant  time  intervals,  while  the  two  other  observers  move  with 
5  presents  a

derivation of the RAPV involving relativity via the time dilation. The 
scenario  he  follows  presents  many  side  steps  and  complicated 
figures. 
We  propose  a  scenario  that  leads  to  RAPV  involving  only  the 
 
time  dilation  formula  which,  in  Asher’s4  derivation,  is  a  direct 
consequence of the relativistic principle only. This scenario involves 
the  OX(O’X’)  axes  of  the  K(XOY)  and  K’(X’O’Y”)  inertial  reference 
frames  in  the  standard  arrangement,  with  the  corresponding 
synchronized  C(x,0) and C’(x’,0) of the two frames located at the 
different points of the mentioned axes. An important role is played 
,  located  at  the  origins  O  and  O’, 
by  the  clocks  CO(0,0)  and  CO
respectively.  As  a  consequence  of  the  time  dilation  effect,  when 
clock  CO’(0,0),  which  reads  t’,  is  located  in  front  of  clock  C(x,0), 
which reads t, the two clock readings are related by 

  relative  to  it,  respectively.  Sartori

The scenario also involves a machine gun (MG) located at the origin 
O and at rest relative to K. It fires successive bullets in the positive 
direction of the OX axis at constant time intervals Te. Let ux be the 
speed of the bullets relative to K (Figure 1). A target at rest located 
at the origin of K’, O’, receives the first fired bullet at a time t=0, 
when  it  is  located  in  front  of  the  MG.  The  second  bullet,  having 
been fired at a time Te, hits the target at a point M(x=VTr,0), where 
Tr represents the reading of clock C(x=VTr,0) located at that point. 
Equating  the  distance  travelled  by  the  second  bullet  with  the 
distance travelled by the target between the reception of the first 
and the second bullets, we obtain

Detecting  the  same  experiment  from  the  rest  frame  of  the 
target (K’), the MG moves with speed V in the negative direction of 
the O’X’ axis while the bullets move with speed ux’ in the positive 
direction  of  the  same  axis.  Equating  the  distance  travelled  by  the 
MG  between  the  firing  of  two  successive  bullets  with  the  distance

From  a  single  scenario  and  without  intermediary  steps,  we 
have  derived  a  relationship  between  the  OX(O’X’)  components  of 
the  same  bullet  that  moves  with  speed  ux  relative  to  K  and  with 
speed ux’ relative to K’, where K’ moves with speed V relative to K 
and  all  the  velocities  are  oriented  in  the  positive  direction  of  the 
common OX(O’X’) axes.

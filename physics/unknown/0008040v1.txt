Abstract

The  construction  of  the  60-MeV  proton  linac  has
started  as  a  low-energy  front  of  the  KEK/JAERI  Joint
Project for a high-intensity proton accelerator facility at
KEK. The accelerating frequency is 324 MHz. Five UHF
klystrons  are  used  as  an  rf  source;  their  ratings  have  a
maximum power of 3 MW, a beam pulse width of a 700
m sec (an rf pulse width is 650 m sec) and a repetition rate
of 50 pps. We have manufactured a proto-type rf source
(a  power-supply  system  with  a  modulating-anode  pulse
modulator  and  prototype  klystrons).  In  this  paper,  the
specifications  and  developments  of 
the  rf  source,
including 
system,  are
summarized.  During  the  manufacturing  process,  strong
oscillations  due 
the
collector were observed. This phenomenon was analyzed
both experimentally and theoretically. We have tested up
to  an  output  power  of  nearly  3  MW,  and  succeeded  to
test the DTL hot-model structure.

  INTRODUCTION

The KEK/JAERI Joint Project, a currently proposed
accelerator complex, comprises a 600-MeV proton linac,
a  3-GeV  rapid-cycling  synchrotron  and  a  50-GeV
synchrotron  [1].  The  600-MeV  linac  comprises  a  200-
MeV, 324-MHz low-b
 section, a 972-MHz section from
200 MeV to 400 MeV, and a 972-MHz super-conducting
section from 400 MeV to 600 MeV. The construction of
the  60-MeV  linac  in  KEK  has  been  started  as  a  low-
energy  front  of  this  KEK/JAERI  Joint  Project.  The  60-
MeV linac comprises a negative hydrogen ion source, a
3-MeV RFQ linac, a 50-MeV DTL and a SDTL [2]. The
accelerating  frequency  is  324  MHz.  High-power  and
high-duty rf-sources are required for these structures, and
a 324-MHz klystron with a modulating-anode has been
adopted as the rf-power source. Although the maximum
rating  of  the  klystron  is  3  MW  for  650  m sec  rf  pulse
duration and a 50 pps repetition rate, the actual working
level of the klystron is 2 MW. Because this working rf-
power  must  be  well  controlled  both  in  amplitude  and
phase,  the  klystron  is  required  to  generate  a  saturated
output  power  of  2.5  MW  at  the  same  duty  and  be
operated at the 2-MW output power level by controlling
the  driving  power.  Since  a  klystron  with  a  modulating-

  ANODE MODULATOR FOR THE 324-MHZ

KLYSTRON

  Since  the  324-MHz  klystron  was  planed  to  be

was adopted as the rf source while considering the entire
project scheme[4]. The specifications are given in Table
1.  The  operating  frequency,  324  MHz,  was  lower  than
that  of  the  CERN  1MW  tube,  which  was  the  lowest-
frequency  klystron  practically  used  in  a  large-scale
accelerator; therefore, as a first step, a high-power model
of  a  co-axial  window  and  a  beam  test  tube  were
manufactured and tested in 1998. The former was tested
up to 2-MW output power using the 432-MHz JHP test
facility. The beam test tube was operated up to 110-kV
dc cathode voltage, 720 m sec  beam  pulse  width  and  50
pps  repetition  [5].  The  prototype  klystrons  were  then
developed  and  tested  from  1999  to  2000  and  used  for
high-power  tests  of  the  waveguide  components  and
accelerator  structure.  This  klystron  is  4.5m  long,  from
the bottom of the oil tank to the top of the collector, and
was  mounted  horizontally.  Figure  1  shows  a  picture  of
the test station at KEK.

to  develop  a  new 

mounted  horizontally  with  its  oil  tank  socket,  it  was
necessary 
independent  anode
modulator. This was installed in a compact oil tank; one
pair  of  filaments  in  the  high-voltage  cathode  potential
and a modulating anode connection are connected to the
klystron socket. A DC high voltage was supplied from
the  old  DC  power  supply  to  this  anode  modulator
through a high-voltage cable in the test station. A hard-
tube  switching  device  (TH-5188)  and  associated  G1,
G2 power supplies were assembled as a module; further,
it is easy to replace. This modulator produced a pulse
with a rise time of 32 m sec and a fall time of 183 m sec.
Using  the  test  beam  tube  mentioned  before,  this
modulator was operated up to the full rating of about 93
kV at a cathode voltage of 110 kV with a pulse width of
750  m sec  and  a  repetition  rate  of  50  pps.  Recently,  a
high-voltage transistor switch was developed to replace
the hard tube, and was successfully tested at KEK.

  DRIVER AND HIGH-POWER WAVEGUIDE

SYSTEM

Although  the  driving  system  for  the  324-MHz
klystron  in  the  test  station  simply  comprised  a  signal
generator,  a  pulse  modulator,  an  attenuator  and  an
amplifier,  a  feedback  control  system  was  recently
constructed  and  tested  in  the  low-power  driving  system
[7]. This was done because the high precision control of
the rf amplitude of less than 1% and a phase of less than
1  degree  is  required  in  order  to  mate  the  injection
requirements  to  the  3-GeV  synchrotron  so  that  D p/p  is
less than 0.1%.

The  WR-2300 

rectangular  waveguide 

system
comprises a directional coupler, a 3-dB hybrid, a phase-
shifter of the triple-stub type, a high-power circulator and
a  co-axial  (WX-203D) 
to  a  rectangular-waveguide
transition. Since the output power from a klystron is fed
to  two  accelerating  structures,  the  high-power  WR2300
rectangular waveguide system must have a precise 3dB-
hybrid power-divider and a phase shifter in one port after
the  power  divider  due 
to  phase  and  amplitude
requirements. A design refinement is now progressing. A
high-power waveguide circulator was also developed in
order  to  protect  the  klystron  from  any  large  reflection
power at the rising time and the falling time of the pulse.
These  components  have  been  successfully  tested  using
the high-power klystron.

During the first test, strong spurious oscillations were
observed.  These  occurred  under  high-voltage  operation
in the range of 65-72 kV and higher than 90 kV without
any  driving  input  power.  The  operating  frequency  was
nearly the same as the operating one. These oscillations
were  concluded  to  be  caused  by  back-going  electrons
from  the  collector,  since  the  some  of  the  oscillations
ceased  when  a  weak  deflecting  magnetic  field  was
applied  in  the  collector  region.  Since  this  klystron’s
operating frequency is low, the drift-tube radius is large

and  the  aspect  ratio  of  diameters  of  a  drift-tube  to  a
collector  is  small  compared  with  the  other  frequency-
band klystron. From a simulation using the EGS4 code, it
became  clear  that  the  back-going  electrons  could  be
decreased by using a larger diameter collector[6]. Several
experiments  with  different  collector  shapes  were
performed

type phase shifter as the reflection device. This was also
useful to optimize the klystron circuit parameters.

  Characteristics of the Klystron

So far, three klystrons were built and tested at KEK.
After  investigating  the  back-going  electrons  from  the
collector,  the  spurious  oscillation  was  successfully
eliminated  and  the  klystron  data  were  measured.  The
latest  test  was  performed  up  to  the  107-kV  cathode
voltage. A limitation came from arcing of the switching
tetrode in the modulating anode power supply. Figure 2
shows the output-power characteristics with the function
of  the  applied  voltage.  Figure  3  shows  the  output
characteristic with the function of the input drive power
(Figure 3 left) and that with the function of the frequency
of the input drive signal (Figure 3 right).

Nearly  3-MW  output  power  and  the  efficiency  of
52% were obtained when the anode voltage was applied
at  a  value  10%  higher  than  the  nominal  operating
condition  at  a  cathode  voltage  of  106.6kV.  Lower-gain
operation  was  preferable  for  more  stable  output
characteristics.  For  more  stable  operation  and  higher
efficiency, 
further  design  development  might  be
considered.

  SUMMARY

A  test  of  the  rf  source  of  the  60-MeV  linac  was
successfully  performed  at  KEK.  The  324-MHz  high-
power  klystron  exceeded  the  saturated  output  power  of
2.5  MW,  the  required  power  of  the  working  point.  The
power  supply  and  the  anode  modulator  were  also
operated up to their full ratings. High-power waveguide
components  and  an  accelerator  structure  test  are  under
development. From the fall of 2000, construction of the
60-MeV  linac  for  the  KEK/JAERI  Joint  Project  will  be
conducted in a new building.

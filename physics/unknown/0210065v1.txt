Abstract
Additional  information  about  the  eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a physical system
demands  extension  of  the  effective  Hamiltonian  in use. In this work we extend the
effective  Hamiltonian  that  describes  partially  a  physical  system  so  that  the  new
Hamiltonian  comprises,  in  addition  to  the  information in the old Hamiltonian, new
information,  available  by means of experiment or theory.  A simple expression of the
enlarged  Hamiltonian,  which does not involve matrix inversion, is obtained. It is also
shown  that  the Lee-Suzuki transformation effectively put the initial Hamiltonian in a
diagonal block form.

1. Introduction

It  is well known that Schrodinger equation cannot be solved analytically except in
limited  simple  cases.  This  calls upon approximation methods, of which perturbation
method  is  most  common  [1,2],  to  find  approximate solutions of this equation. The
perturbation  method  hinges  on  ignoring  a  part  of  the  Hamiltonian  H,  called  the
perturbed  part,  so  that  the  resulting  equation  is  solvable  analytically.  The  full
Hamiltonian  H  is  described  as perturbed, whereas the simplified one is described as
unperturbed.  The unperturbed equation is solved analytically, and the corrections that
take into account the ignored part are calculated. The set of eigenvectors
the  unperturbed  Hamiltonian  is  taken  as  a  basis in the infinite dimensional Hilbert

It  must  be  noted  that,  whenever  the  eigenvalue  problem  is  to  be  solved
numerically, which is usually the case in physically interesting problems, truncation is
inevitable  task.  We  also  note  that  truncating an infinite basis by a finite one with a
sufficiently  large  number  of  basis  elements is justified by the fact that the sequence

Supposing  that  the  truncated  space  Η  is  good  enough  to  replace  the  full
 matrix that acts in
Hilbert  space, the full Hamiltonian can be represented by a
the  truncated  space.  It  must  be  emphasized  that  truncation  is  dictated  by  the
computation  process  and is independent of the approximation method employed. It is
of
quite  likely  that  the  approximation  method may yield good estimates 
the  first d  levels,  and  that  the  accuracy  decreases  as  the  number  n  of  the  level
increases,  so  that it becomes unacceptable for 
n >  (n is still much smaller than N).
Assuming  that  some  experimental facts or theoretical considerations assures that the
are  good  estimates  of  the next (n-d) levels, then the question

A  second  approach  in approximation, namely effective Hamiltonian methods
[5-12],  is  common  in  nuclear  and  molecular  physics.  This  approach  is  based on
11H  in  a  d-dimensional  subspace of the truncated space
constructing  a  Hamiltonian 
Η that  possesses d  eigenvalues of the full Hamiltonian. The question also arises how
to  incorporate in this Hamiltonian additional data based on experiment or theory. Our
goal  in  this  work  is to study the problem associated with this question in an abstract
sense, and give a rigorous answer of the question we just posed.

3. Conditions of Diagonal Block Form

We discuss here the conditions imposed on the given eigenvectors so that the

matrix L, which we have constructed, is immediately in a diagonal block form:

4. Incorporation of New Information into the Hamiltonian

We mean by this title that given a Hermitian operator 
Hamiltonian of some physical system)  as well as a set of numbers and a
corresponding set of vectors, then our goal is to construct a new Hermitian operator H
whose spectrum is composed of the spectrum of 

11H  (for example the

11H as well as these given numbers,

11H  in
and whose corresponding eigenvectors consist of the set of eigenvectors of 
addition to the given vectors. There are, of course, some conditions which are to be
satisfied by the given vectors. These conditions will be spelled out in the sequel.

To state the problem concretely, let 

space

11H  be a Hermitian operator in a Hilbert

It remains thus to prove that the operator H ,which we have just constructed, is
Hermitian.

In fact the representation (16) is always valid as long as every basis element does not

have components in both  Π  and 
is merely the identity operator. Similarly, the matrix of the projection operator P is

.⊥Π   This is evident since the restriction of Q  to  Π

Recalling that projection operators are Hermitian, we deduce that 

= HH
,+H  and hence is Hermitian.

  i.e. the

operator H is equal to its adjoint operator

Abstract

The monopole systems with hidden symmetry of the two-dimensional

Coulomb problem are considered.

One of them, the “charge-charged magnetic vortex” (“charge-Z2-dyon)
with a half-spin, is constructed by reducing the quantum circular oscillator
with respect to the action of the parity operator.

The other two systems are constructed by reduction from the two-dimensi-
onal complex space. The ﬁrst system is a particle on the sphere in the presence
of the exterior constant magnetic ﬁeld (generated by Dirac’s monopole located
in its center). This system is dual to the massless (3+1)-dimensional particle
with ﬁxed energy. The second system represents the particle on the pseudo-
sphere in the presence of exterior magnetic ﬁeld and is dual to the massive
relativistic anyon.

1 Introduction

As it is well-known, most of the integrable systems of classical mechanics can be
constructed by the Hamiltonian reduction of the simplest systems of the type of a
free particle or an oscillator formulated on a larger phase space [1]. This kind of
construction not only classiﬁes the known integrable systems but also allows one to
construct new integrable systems together with their explicit solutions.

The procedure of reduction becomes especially important in quantum mechanics
where it is much more diﬃcult to establish integrability and exact solvability of
systems. For example, thought any one-dimensional system of classical mechanics
is integrable and exactly solvable, the corresponding quantum-mechanical system
being integrable is exactly solvable only in exceptional cases.

On the other hand, the Hamiltonian reduction provides a natural framework to
construct integrable spinning systems, including multiparticle integrable ones (see,
e.g., [2]).

An interesting feature is that such two-, three- and higher dimensional systems
can be interpreted as the ones interacted with external gauge ﬁelds of monopoles.
Correspondingly, the spin in these systems can be viewed as a consequence of the

nontrivial topology induced by the presence of a monopole. Moreover, in the dual
interpretation, i.e. under exchange of the role of coordinates and momenta, these
systems can be interpreted as free relativistic systems of spinning particles in an
appropriate gravitational background.

A good illustration is a Hamiltonian reduction of the four-dimensional isotropic
group action with the nonzero value s of the Hamiltonian

oscillator under the U(1)
generator of that group.

−

As a result of that reduction, the oscillator phase space T∗ IC2 reduces to the
phase space of a nonrelativistic charge-Dirac monopole system which is T∗IR3 with
the symplectic structure

Notice that the “centrifugal” term in this Hamiltonian provides the interaction of
the induced dipole momentum of the systems with the monopole magnetic ﬁeld [4].
In the dual picture, i.e. after the exchange of the role of the coordinates and
momenta, the reduced phase space describes (3+1)-dimensional massless particles
with the helicity s. This duality becomes clear in a four- dimensional picture where
the prototypes of phase space variables and the generators of spatial rotations de-
ﬁne the well-known twistor realization of the (3+1)-dimensional Poincar´e group for
massless particles.

When the initial system reduces with respect to Hamiltonian action of the non-
Abelian group , the resulting system acquires isospin degrees of freedom. An example
is the generalization of the ﬁve-dimensional Coulomb problem, which includes the
interaction with the SU(2) monopole ﬁeld. This system was constructed by reducing
the eight-dimensional isotropic oscillator under the SU(2)-group action both in the
classical [5] and quantum [6] cases.

In the general case, the system obtained by reduction under Hamiltonian action
of the G group, posesses an interaction with an external G-ﬁeld, and the values of
the generators of the G-group play the role of charges [7].

In the present paper, we consider the above mechanisms on the systems which

are related to the two-dimensional Coulomb problem.

2

In Section 2, we show that despite the classical equivalence of the two-dimen-
sional Coulomb problem and circular oscillator, established by the Bohlin-Levi-
Chivita transformation, the quantum correspondence between these systems requires
reduction of the quantum circular oscillator by the parity operator (Z2-group) action.
As a result, the oscillator breaks into two systems, the two-dimensional Coulomb
problem, and its generalization, with half-spin induced by the magnetic vortex (or,
equivalently, two-dimensional “charge-Z2-dyon” system) [9].

In Section 3, we perform the Hamiltonian reduction of four- dimensional systems

to particles on the sphere and pseudosphere in homogeneous magnetic ﬁelds.

The ﬁrst system is a particle on a sphere which interacts with a magnetic
monopole located in its center, and it is dual to the (3+1)-dimensional massless
particle with ﬁxed energy. The second system has a dual interpretation as a free
massive relativistic anyon [10].

2 Coulomb Problem with Magnetic Vortex

Consider the correspondence between the two-dimensional Coulomb problem and
classical two- dimensional isotropic oscillator (circular oscillator) [8].

It is convenient to describe the Hamiltonian system, corresponding to the circular
oscillator, in terms of the phase space T∗ IC by using the following canonical Poisson
brackets and Hamiltonian

{

{

(2.1)

This system has three integrals of motion which forms the su(2) algebra: the os-
cillators rotational momentum J and the two other generators which are convenient
to be presented in the form of the complex (vector) integral of motion I + and its
complex-conjugated one I −:

(2.5)

Note that in passing from the oscillator to the Coulomb problem the rotational
momentum of the system is doubled. This reﬂects the fact, that the single round
of the orbit in the oscillator problem corresponds to the double round of the orbit
in the Coulomb one. To verify this, we parametrize the oscillator trajectories by
Zhukovski’s ellipse z = u + 1/u where the complex parameter u parametrizes a
circle with a radius diﬀerent from unity,
= 1. Then, as a result of
transformation w = z2 we have

= const

u

|

|

z = u + 1/u

w = u2 + 1/u2 + 2,

→

which means that the center of attraction of the Coulomb problem is shifted to the
focus of ellipse, and a single round of the ellipses by the particle in the oscillator
problem corresponds to the double rounding of the orbit in the Coulomb one.

So, when we deal with elliptic orbits, we can ascertain the equivalence of the

circular oscillator and two-dimensional Coulomb problems on the classical level.

In the corresponding quantum problem we have

Hosc(ˆπ, ˆ¯π, z, ¯z)Ψ = EoscΨ, Ψ(

Therefore, we should supply the transformation (2.3) with the reduction of the
oscillator Schr¨odinger equation by the Z2-group action given by the parity operator.
This means that we may restricts ourselves to the even (σ = 0) or odd (σ = 1

solutions of the oscillator Schr¨odinger equation

Ψσ(z, ¯z) = ψσ(z2, ¯z2)eiσarg z.

3 Particle on Sphere and Pseudosphere

The hidden symmetry of the Coulomb problem establishes its trajectorial corre-
spondence with an isotropic oscillator only in the two-, three-, and ﬁve- dimensional
cases.

In the general case, the n-dimensional Coulomb problem is trajectory-equivalent
to a geodesic ﬂux on the n
dimensional sphere (attractive problem) or n-dimensi-
onal pseudosphere (repulsive problem). Integrals of motion of the Coulomb problem
correspond to the rotation generators on the (pseudo)sphere. Equivalence between
these systems in the two-dimensional case can be established as follows:

⇔

It can be easily veriﬁed that the Hamiltonian of a particle on a sphere (pseu-
dosphere) under transformation (2.3) goes over into the squared Hamiltonian of a
circular oscillator with the positive (negative) coupling constant

Notice that ICP1 and

L
can be constructed by the Hamiltonian reduction of IC2
and IC1.1 equipped by the K´ahler structures dπαd¯πα under the U(1)-group action
which is deﬁned by the generator P = πα¯πα with the value P = m. Hereafter,
indices are raised and lowered by using the metric ηα ¯β where ηα ¯β = δα ¯β on IC2 and
ηα ¯β = σ3

α ¯β on IC1.1.

The canonical Poisson brackets on IC2 and IC1.1 are reduced to those correspond-
ing to the K¨ahler structures (3.1) under the following choice of coordinates of
the reduced phase spaces p(0) = π1/π0, ¯p(0) = ¯π1/¯π0 in the domain π0
= 0, and
p(1) = π0/π1, ¯p(1) = ¯π0/¯π1, in the domain π1
= 0. So, a sphere can be covered with
two charts with the transition functions p(0) = 1/p(1), where p parametrizes the com-
plex plane, while a pseudosphere can be covered with only one chart parametrized
by the coordinate p(0),

of the reduced phase space of the form

P a = πT a¯π, Qa = i(ωT aπ

−

we see that T∗ IC2 (T∗ IC1.1) is reduced to T∗IR3 (T∗IR1.2) while the reduced symplectic

transformation (Qa, P a)

known twistor realization of the (3+1)-dimensional Poincar´e group for the massless
particles, and J plays the role of their helicity. This gives transparent explanation of
the duality between massless particles and nonrelativistic “charge-monopole” system
mentioned in the Introduction.

−

One can interpret the systems, reduced to sphere, in term of the (3+1)-dimen-
sional Poincare group. In this case, the radius of the sphere has a meaning of the
energy of the massless particle whereas the spin of the system has a meaning of the
helicity.

However, since the generator P does not commute with the generators of the
Lorentz rotation, the performed Hamiltonian reduction to the sphere destroys the
Lorentz invariance of the reduced system.

Unlike the system on the sphere, the one on the pseudosphere admits complete

relativistic interpretation [10].

Namely, the generators P a, J a deﬁne on T∗ IC1.1 the action of the (2+1)-dimen-
sional Poincar´e group and commute with J and P . Thus, the reduced system is
relativistic-invariant .

The “Casimirs” P aPa and PaJ a satisfy the following conditions:

P aPa = P 2, PaJ a = P J.

Hence, the generators J and P can be interpreted as those of spin and mass of
the relativistic particle. Note that the transformation π1

s) and, consequently, is an identity transformation in terms of the

Poincar´e group. So, the Hamiltonian reduction by the action of the generators P

Let us now outline the scheme of an analogous reduction in the quantum case.

Introduce the operators

and impose on the wave function Ψ(π, ¯π) the conditions

ˆ¯ωα = ∂/∂πα,

ˆωα =

∂/∂¯πα,

−

ˆP Ψ(π, ¯π) = mΨ(π, ¯π),

ˆJΨ(π, ¯π) = sΨ(π, ¯π)

(3.11)

which are the quantum analogs of the constraints (3.4).

The solution to this system can be represented in the form

Ψ(π, ¯π) = ψm,s(p, ¯p)eisγ(π,¯π), where

ˆJγ = i,

(3.12)

from which it follows:

where

ˆwΨ = g(p, ¯p)(ˆλ1

pˆλ0)Ψ = eisγ ˆwredψ(p, ¯p),

−

∂
∂p

s
2m

ˆwred = i

+

A(p, ¯p), Aγ(p, ¯p) = ˆwγ.

(3.13)

(3.14)

So, ψ(p, ¯p) and ˆwred deﬁne the wave function and the momentum operator of the
reduced system.

Choosing γ+ = i log π0/¯π0 or γ− = i log π1/¯π1, we ﬁnd A+(p, ¯p) = i∂pK(p, ¯p) and

A−(p, ¯p) = i∂¯pK(p, ¯p), respectively, where K(p, ¯p) = m log(1 + pp+).

We can also choose γ = (γ++γ−)/2. In this case, each chart contains a singularity
in p = 0, while the choice γ± at p = p± leads to a system, being regular on each
chart.

The reduction of the initial system by only generator J suggest the ansatz
Ψ(π, ¯π) = ψ(P a)eisγ which results in the mometum operator with the vector po-
tential of the Dirac monopole at γ = γ±, and vector potential of the Schwinger one
at γ = (γ+ + γ−)/2.

It is clear that ψm.s(p, ¯p) = ψs(P a) where P a are deﬁned by (3.9).

The choice of γ depends on a given problem. For example, the requirement of
invariance of the wave function on the sphere under transition from one chart to
another implies the choice γ = (γ+ + γ−)/2 which corresponds to the Schwinger
monopole. If γ = γ±, the reduced system is regular on both the charts, i.e. we have
Dirac’s monopole.

The requirement for the wave function to be single-valued leads to the quanti-

zation of spin: it takes integer or half-integer values.

Now, consider the system on IC1.1 corresponding to that on IR1.2 and on the

pseudosphere.

In this case the choice γ = γ± leads to systems with regular vector potentials
on both IR1.2 and the pseudosphere (since the later can be covered with one chart).

9

Therefore, the requirement of regularity does not impose any quantization condition
on s. As we have shown, a system on a pseudosphere can be interpreted as a
two-dimensional free relativistic particle, that is an anyon, because its spin is not
quantized[10],[11].

↔

One can look at this picture from another point of view. We have shown that
(π0, ω0) is the identity transformation for a two-dimensional relativistic
(π1, ω1)
particle. Taking γ = (γ+ + γ−)/2, we obtain that the requirement of the single-
valuedness of the wave function Ψs does not leads to the quantization of s due to
the signature of the metric on IC1.1. On the other hand, the initial system with
a given choice of γ can be viewed as the system of two identical particles. Thus,
interchanging these particles, we ﬁnd that the wave function acquires the phase 2πs.

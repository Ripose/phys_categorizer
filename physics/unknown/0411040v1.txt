Abstract.  By  the  example  of  phase  transition  (α  -  β)  in  p-dichlorobenzene  it  is  shown,  that  for 
phase transition presence of vacancies is necessary. In an ideal crystal, such transition is improbable, 
that is confirmed with calculations and their consent with experimental information on spectrums of 
the lattice oscillations.  
 

 

In  the  molecular  crystals,  phase 
transitions  flow  past  as  against  nuclear 
structures  not  only  at  displacements  of 
centre  of  gravity,  but  also  change  of 
orientation 
of  molecules.  These 
changes  will  happen,  if  it  is  energy 
possible.  As  is  known  actual  crystals 
contain  flaws  (vacancies,  impurities, 
etc.). There is a problem, whether phase 
transition if the structure of a crystal is 
ideal is possible.  

For  clearing  up  of  this  problem 
calculation of energy of a lattice of the 
molecular  crystal,  both  with 
ideal 
structure  have  been  carried  out,  and  at 
in  structure  of  vacancies.

Thus,  displacements  of  centre  of 
gravity  and  change  of  orientation  of 
molecules  happening  was  taken  into 
account at phase transition.  

As  object  of  examination,  p-
dichlorobenzene  has  been  chosen. 
Various authors repeatedly explored P-
dichlorobenzene. It has been found, that 
at  temperature  30.8  ºС  there  is  a 
polymorphic  transmutation.  The  low-

1.  Introduction

According  to  the  principle  of  complementarity,  it  is  not  possible  to  attribute  wave  and
particle properties to a dynamical system in the same experiment.  The principle leads to
the conclusion that particles do not follow precise trajectories, since in many experiments,
only the wavelike properties can be observed [1].

The double slit experiment provides an example. An interference pattern is produced by
illuminating  a  double  slit  with  a  beam  of  particles.  The  pattern  persists  even  when  one
particle at a time passes through the apparatus, provided a large number of particles are
accumulated over time.

The  particle-like  properties  can  be  observed  by  placing  detectors  close  to  the  slits.  It  is
found  that  particles  always  pass  through  one  slit  or  the  other,  but  the  measurements
destroy the interference pattern. If an experiment is designed to measure the interference
pattern,  then  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  which  slit  the  particle  passed  through.
Variations of the experiment are possible, in which the type of measurement is selected
randomly  at  the  last  moment  [2].  The  principle  of  complementarity  leads  to  the
conclusion that the trajectory of the particle through the slit, if it has one, is determined
only when the particle reaches the measuring apparatus on the other side of the slit.

the
The  deBroglie-Bohm  quantum 
complementarity  principle.  The  basic  postulate  of  Bohm’s  theory  is  that  particles  do
follow precise trajectories in space. The motion of the particle is never separated from a
quantum  field  and  is  fundamentally  influenced  by  the  field.  Bohm  defines  a  quantum
potential, which is treated as a real physical field [3].

theory  of  motion  denies 

the  validity  of 

Bohm  accepts  the  existence  of  non-local  interactions  in  quantum  mechanics.  These  are
inferred from measurements on pairs of space-like separated particles that have interacted
in  the  past.  The  experiments  show  that  one  measurement  event  can  influence  another
event when the two events are space-like separated, apparently implying the existence of
non-local interactions [4].

The  theory  discussed  in  this  paper  is  a  development  of  Bohm’s  work  but  non-local
interactions  are  avoided  by  allowing  causal  effects  to  propagate  in  the  backward  light
cone [5].

The  electron  is  considered  to  be  a  relativistic  point  particle  with  mass,  charge  and  spin
angular momentum. A unified description of the particle and field is provided by treating
the  particle  as  a  singularity  in  the  electromagnetic  field.  The  relativistic  energy  of  the
particle exists as electromagnetic energy, localized at the singularity.

An elementary particle is postulated to have a spin whose frequency is given by Planck’s
relation

where E is the total relativistic energy of the particle. The spin frequency defines a radius
r at which the linear velocity is equal to the speed of light c.

(1)

n  = E / h

=

r

(cid:1)

mc

The  energy  of  the  particle  is  confined  within  a  sphere  of  radius  r,  centred  at  the
singularity.  Calculation  of  the  angular  momentum  gives  1 2/ (cid:1) per  axis  and  a  rotational
energy equal to 3/4E. The remaining part of the energy is attributed to the binding energy
of the charge.  The  total  relativistic energy  can  be equated  with  the  energy  stored  in  the
field if the coupling strength increases by a factor given by the fine structure constant at
distances comparable to r (10-13m).

For a particle in a potential well, the spin frequency is given by

n =

where  T  is  the  kinetic  energy  and  V  is  a  quantum  potential  such  that  the  energy

where S is the action [6]. The difference in action between two trajectories with the same
end points is therefore equal to the difference in total phase.

The phase along any trajectory in the ensemble is postulated to have spatial coherence. If
the particle has a momentum p and a position x at time t, then the phase is given by the
phase of waves existing in the vacuum such that

The rate of change of phase is equal to n . The spatial coherence is expressed by requiring
that  the  phase  constant  d   be  the  same  for  all  trajectories  in  the  ensemble.  For  this
condition to hold, a shift in the phase of the spin must occur whenever a stochastic force
field  existing  in  the  vacuum  causes  the  momentum  to  change.  If  this  shift  is  always
positive,  the  total  phase  will  increase  less  rapidly  in  regions  of  space  where  the  waves
have similar phases.

Consider  the  ensemble  of  all  possible  particle  trajectories  with  a  given  momentum
distribution. They can be ordered by total phase. The lower the total phase of a trajectory,
the  more  likely  that  it  will  occur.  The  position  probability  density  for  the  ensemble  is
determined from the subset of trajectories approaching the minimum value, given by the
mean of S for the momentum distribution.

The  requirement  that  the  physically  occurring  trajectories  have  total  phase  approaching
the  minimum  value  is  an  expression  of  the  principle  of  least  action.  The  source  of  the
stochastic field is taken to be random shifts in the phase of the vacuum waves.

A mathematical development of this model is given below.

Consider an electron in its rest frame. According to (1) above, and using the relativistic
connection between mass and energy, the spin frequency is given by

where  m0  is  the  rest  mass  of  the  particle.  If  the  particle  is  moving  with  a  velocity  v
relative to reference frame S, then the mass m, measured by an observer in S, is given by

Lorentz invariance requires that the spin frequency in the moving frame is given by

It follows from the principle of relativity that no part of  the rotating energy distribution
of  the  particle  can  be  travelling  at  faster  than  the  speed  of  light.  Hence  the  maximum
radius r of the particle can be taken to be the distance at which the linear velocity is equal
to the speed of light. Then

It  follows  that  the  radius  r  undergoes  a  Lorentz  contraction  during  transformations  to

The charge of the particle can also be considered as existing in the field. Suppose that the
particle is a point source for an electric displacement field D such that

where q is the particle charge and the integration is carried out over a surface S enclosing
the particle.

Since the vacuum is a polarizable medium, the field induces a polarization P, given by
P  =  D.  The  potential  V  due  to  a  polarized  dielectric  can  be  attributed  to  an  apparent
volume distribution of charge div(P) and an apparent surface charge. The potential due to
the surface charge is

(13)

(14)

The contribution from the volume charge is zero, since divD = 0 except at the singularity.

This shows that the charge of a point source  can  be treated as equivalent  to an induced
polarization  charge on a small sphere enclosing  the  particle.  The  particle  charge  can  be
considered as polarization charge in the vacuum and the presence of a charged particle is
equivalent to a charge distribution in the field.

In  summary,  the  model  treats  the  electron  as  a  singularity  in  the  electromagnetic  field.
The  singularity  is  the  source  of  an  electric  displacement  field  which  induces  a  charge
density in the vacuum. The mass-energy of the particle is equated with the energy stored
in the field of the singularity.

Suppose that a particle, initially at rest, falls into a potential well and radiates energy. The
initial energy of the  system is just the rest masses of the  particle  and  the potential. The
total energy after capture of the particle is given by

where  m1   is  the  rest  mass  of  the  potential  and  E  is  the  (negative)  radiated  energy.  The
total energy for the motion of the particle is equal to E. It is the sum of the terms

where  T  is  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  particle  and  V  is  the  potential  energy  stored  in  the

In  order  that  the  combined  system  of  the  potential  well  and  the  particle  transform
correctly  under  Lorentz  transformations,  the  combined  rest  mass  of  the  particle  and  the
energy  stored  in  the  potential  must  be  equal  to  m0 .  Consequently,  the  rest  mass  of  the
particle is reduced by V c/

The  physically  observable  properties  of  the  motion  of  the  particle  are  position  and
momentum  probability  distributions  for  an  ensemble  of  identically  prepared  physical
systems.  In    the  following  description,  the  dynamical  variables  are  treated  as  sets  of
random  variables,  indexed  by  the  time  t.  They  are  defined  for  an  ensemble  of  sample
realizations.  The  particle  position  for  the  nth  trajectory  in  the  ensemble  is  denoted  by
Xn(t).  The  process  is  assumed  to  be  ergodic,  that  is  to  say,  ensemble  averaging  is
equivalent  to  time  averaging.  Consequently  the  trajectory  of  a  single  particle,  averaged
over time, has the same statistical properties as an ensemble of trajectories.

The kinetic and potential energies along the nth trajectory can be represented by Tn(t) and
Vn(t). The potential energy is no longer a deterministic function of position. It is not the
classical potential energy but simply the energy stored in the vacuum field. E and V are
always negative quantities and T can take any positive value.

3.2  Self Field of the Electron

It is known that the position and momentum  distributions for  the  motion  of  an electron
are  correctly  predicted  by  quantum  mechanics.  Given  that  the  instantaneous  spin
frequency along the nth trajectory is  n
n , what additional hypothesis is required to give a
theory that replicates the predictions of quantum mechanics?

According to the model of the electron developed earlier, the electric displacement field
of the particle induces a charge density in the vacuum. For a particle at rest, the charge
distribution is a surface charge on a sphere enclosing the source. When the particle is in
motion, the charge density becomes a volume distribution of charge.

Let  r (x,t)  denote  the  instantaneous  charge  density.  The  following  hypothesis  is  now
introduced: There exists a  physical field  y (x,t), defined  in four-dimensional  space-time,
such that

Experimental  observations  for  an  ensemble  of  identically  prepared  systems  give  a

that  q  =  1  and  the  mean  charge  density  is  then  defined  as  equivalent  to  the  position
probability density.

momentum distribution of the particle is the same everywhere in space.

Let Q(p) be the momentum probability density. The last postulate is given by

(
Q p

)

=

2

(
a p

)

(26)

This can be taken to define a charge density in momentum space. The proportion of time
spent by  the  particle  with momentum  in the  interval p to  D p is  given  by  Q(p)D p.  If  the
charge  carried  by  the  vacuum  waves  in  this  interval  is  proportional  to  the  time  the
momentum lies within the interval, then the charge in the interval can be equated with the
square of the wave amplitude a(p), times D p.

The mean field f (x,t) is derived from a summation for the trajectories. It can be equated
with the mean field y (x,t), given by equation (24). Then

The wave speed tends to infinity as p tends to zero and it approaches c from above as p
becomes very large. Wave speeds greater than the speed of light are consistent with the
theory of relativity,  provided that  it is  not  possible  to construct an  experiment in  which
super-luminal signalling occurs.

4.  Conclusion

The theory developed here replicates the observational consequences of the standard
theory of quantum mechanics, often known as the Copenhagen interpretation.
Consequently, the two theories cannot be distinguished on experimental grounds. The
criterion that should be applied instead is the logical consistency of the underlying
assumptions.

Unlike the Copenhagen interpretation, the deBroglie-Bohm theory assigns no special role
to the observer. The principle of complementarity requires that the wave properties of a
particle are not determined until an observer causes an act of measurement. The essential
role played by the observer leads to paradoxes relating to the collapse of the wave
function. These paradoxes cannot be resolved satisfactorily within the Copenhagen
interpretation, whereas the deBroglie-Bohm theory has equal or greater empirical content
but is free of paradoxes and can be developed as a local theory.

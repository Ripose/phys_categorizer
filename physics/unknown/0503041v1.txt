Abstract 

We investigate light propagation in randomly spaced fiber gratings in a single mode 

fiber, and demonstrate the localization effect. Localization of light in random media 

resembles  that  of  electrons  in  disordered  solids,  resulting  from  a  subtle  wave 

interference  formation.  We  measured  the  light  transmission  after  each  additional 

grating  fabrication  and  found  an  exponential  decay  that  follows  the  localization 

theory. An important feature of the random array is its similarity to ordered gratings in 

the  transmission  and  reflection  behavior  at  the  long  array  regime.  Besides  the  basic 

interest  in  localization  in  one-dimensional  systems,  random  grating  arrays  have 

potential applications, utilizing the possibility to fabricate long structures with strong 

and broadband reflections.

1.  Introduction  

Wave propagation in random media has been an important research topic throughout 

the  years,  gaining  much  attention  when  the  concept  of  localization  appeared  and 

stimulated  a  large  amount  of  work.  The  idea  of  localization  was  first  raised  by 

Anderson  [1]  for  electrons  in  disordered  solids  which  were  drastically  affected  by 

quantum  mechanical  wave  interference  [2-3].  The  quest  to  study  and  realize  such 

effects in optics was natural, and indeed a considerable amount of work can be found 

on light propagation in random media that include aspects of localization. Using light, 

in lieu of electrons, for the study of localization adds new possibilities, mainly in the 

experimental  aspects  due  to  the  relatively  easy  measuring  techniques  and  the  direct 

access to the optical “wave function” via light intensity measurement. 

Properties  of  wave  propagation  in  random  media,  including  localization,  depend  in 

general  on  the  system  dimensionality.  The  theoretical  analysis  of  one  dimensional 

system  is  obviously  easier,  than  for  higher  dimensions,  but  is  not  at  all  trivial  for 

experimental realizations in solid state physics. In optics, however, the experimental 

situation is very different, and 1D wave propagation is trivial. There were many works 

on localization aspects with electromagnetic waves in the optical [5-15] as well as the 

microwave  [16]  regimes.  We  point  out  a  work  by  Berry  and  Klein  [5]  that  is  very 

relevant to our present study. It was shown in a simple but remarkable experiment that 

for  a  stack  of  N  transparent  plates  with  randomly  varying  thickness  the  transmitted 

intensity  decays  exponentially  with  N.  The  striking  feature  of  the  random  optical 

elements is that their overall transmissivity τN is given by a simple multiplication of 

the  single  element  transmissivity  τ,  i.e. 

.  It  means  that  only  the  direct 

Nτ τ=

N

transmission  counts,  while  any  multiple  reflections  added  in  the  direction  of  the 

2 

 

 

 

transmitted  light  interfere  destructively.  We  also  presented  in  previous  work  two 

experimental  realizations  for  localization  of  light  in  optical  kicked-rotor,  which 

resemble  the  quantum  kicked-rotor  that  relates  to  Anderson  localization  [11-15].  In 

the first [11-12], we demonstrated localization in the spatial frequency domain of free 

space light beam propagating through an array of thin sinusoidal phase gratings. In the 

second  case  [13-15],  we  studied  the  spectrum  (or  sidebands)  localization  of  light 

pulses which are repeatedly “kicked” by a sinusoidal RF modulation along a fiber.  

In this paper we present an experimental study of 1D localization by means of light 

propagation in a random Bragg grating array fabricated into a single mode fiber. We 

demonstrate the localization behavior, manifested in the strong exponential decay of 

the light transmission along the fiber, that was measured directly after the fabrication 

of each additional grating. This decay, which results in high reflection, should not be 

confused with the much smaller fiber loss. A first report on this finding was given in 

Ref.  [19].  The  theoretical  analysis  of  such  system  is  based  on  the  transfer  matrix 

formalism in which the system is represented by a product of random matrices. The 

asymptotic behavior of such a product results from a theorem on products of random 

matrices  by  Furstenberg  [18].  This  theorem  ensures  that  under  very  general 

conditions,  the  elements  of  the  matrix  product  and  any  norm  of  the  matrix  product 

grow exponentially with the same exponent, giving rise to the localization behavior. 

We refer the reader to a comprehensive analysis for 1D disordered system given  by 

Pendry  [3].  Beside  the  basic  propagation  effects  in  the  random  array,  the  study  can 

have importance ramifications on fiber-optic communication and gratings technology. 

Examples are strong and broadband reflectors, fiber lasers and random lasers.

The scattering elements in our system are the random gratings in single-mode fibers. 

Fibers  are  an  ideal  experimental  medium  for  1D  light  propagation  with  a  matured 

technology  of  in-fiber  grating  fabrication.  The  gratings  were  made  to  be  almost 

identical, with the same and relatively large reflection wavelength bandwidth of a few 

nm,  obtained  by  fabricating  short  gratings.  Therefore  the  interesting  effects 

concerning  the  localization  occur  within  that  bandwidth.  Gratings  are  very  effective 

scattering elements such that we could observe the localization effect with a relatively 

small number of them, about 50 gratings. The randomness of the scattering elements 

enters by the random spacing between the gratings (see Fig. 1.1). 

The outline of the paper chapters is as follows: We first give in chapter 2 theoretical 

treatment of the wave propagation in randomly spaced gratings. We then compare the 

wave theory result for the light transmissivity to the calculation obtained from the ray 

theory and also to wave propagation in an ordered fiber grating. Chapter 3 describes 

the  experiment,  starting  with  the  setup  and  the  grating  fabrication  system,  and  then 

presenting the experimental results. We show transmission measurements, the spectra 

and  the  transmissivity  as  a  function  of  the  gratings  number  for  the  random  fiber 

system.  These  curves  are  the  central  results  of  the  paper,  showing  the  localization 

effect  in  the  random  grating  array.  We  then  compare  the  measured  results  to  the 

theory  and  find  a  very  good  agreement.  We  end  the  paper  with  conclusions  and 

remarks on the application sides.

2.  Theoretical Analysis of Light Transmissivity in a 1D Random 

Grating Array 

We present a theoretical treatment for wave propagation in a single-mode fiber with N 

randomly-spaced Bragg gratings and calculate the transmission in the limit of N>>1, 

to  obtain  the  localization  length.  This  result  readily  reveals  that  the  interference 

among all reflected waves is destructive for the transmission and intuitive explanation 

is presented. We then compare this analysis to ray theory, in which light is treated as 

lacking  phase  property,  to  show  that  contrary  to  the  exact  wave  calculation,  this 

theory results in transmission that decays as 1/N. Finally we calculate the transmission 

of ordered system and compare the decay rates in both cases. 

2.1  Disordered Grating Array 

Transmission calculation through a disordered chain of gratings can be carried out by 

transfer matrices methods [17].  The basic idea underlying such calculation assumes 

that  the  system  can  by  cut  into  slices,  when  each  can  be  easily  evaluated.  Then,  by 

writing the transfer matrix of the complete system as a product of those matrices, we 

can apply Furstenberg theorem [18] to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the product.

The  grating  system  is  described  in  Fig.  1.1.  Light  with  wave-number  k  propagates 

along a single mode fiber having an array of successive randomly-spaced gratings. It 

will be assumed that the space widths, di, are drawn independently from the density 

distribution  function  dµ(di),  and  that  the  gratings  are  identical  i.e.,  have  the  same 

lengths and refractive indices. 

We describe the propagation of the light in the 1D medium by the transfer matrix, Mi 

that  relates  the  amplitudes  of  the  forward  and  backward  propagating  waves  on  the 

right of each optical element to those on the left:

The  transfer  matrices  are  unimodular  (det  mn=1).  In  our  system  we  define  each 

element as being comprised of one grating and its successive space. The gratings are 

taken  to  be  identical,  and  the  spacing  between  are  responsible  for  the  random  part. 

The transfer matrix of such element is the product of the grating transfer matrix and 

the  space  transfer  matrix.  From  coupled  wave  equation  of  the  counter-propagating 

waves, the transfer matrix for a single grating is given by [21]:

TN and RN are the amplitude transmission and reflection coefficients, respectively, for 

the  entire  system.  All  coefficients  as  well  as  the  transfer  matrix  of  the  complete 

optical array are denoted in this paper by capital letters: T, R, M, compared to t, r, m, 

for  one  element.  For  the  use  below  we  also  denote  the  intensity  transmissivity  and 

reflectivity  for  a  single  grating  by:

We next evaluate the product of those N random unimodular matrices of Eq. 2.7,   to 

obtain  the  system  overall  transmission.  The  asymptotic  behavior  of  MN  can  be 

obtained using Furstenberg theorem [18]  on the product of random matrices, stating 

that under very general conditions, the elements of the matrix product and any norm 

of the matrix product grow exponentially with the same exponent:

This simple result reveals an interesting property of the transmission through a set of 

randomly spaced scatterers in a 1D system by showing that it comprises only from the 

multiplication  of  the  single  gratings  transmission  and  doesn't  include  all  multiple 

reflections.  Of  course,  reflections  were  taken  into  consideration  in  the  above 

calculation  but  asymptotically  the  result  teaches  us  that  all  multiple  reflections  are 

canceled. 

2.2 Numerical Simulation for Disordered Grating Array 

In  the  previous  section  we  obtained  the  transmissivity  for  a  large  number  of 

disordered  gratings  and  found  it  to  be  exponentially  decaying  with  the  number  of 

gratings.  Here  we  compare  this  analytical  result  to  a  numerical  simulation  of  the 

transmission. Figures 2.1 and 2.2 depict the transmitted intensity spectrum after 1,000 

and 5,000 gratings, respectively. The gratings were taken to be identical, and have the 

following properties: centered at 1540nm, their coupling coefficient κ = 345m-1, and 

their length L = 0.385mm.  The transmissivity for a single grating at the band center is 

0.0483dB.    The  distances  between  two  successive  gratings  were  chosen  randomly 

from the interval [0–1] mm. The figures also present the transmission spectrum given 

  

5 

 

  

by Equation 2.11, with the wavelength dependent transmission τ, of a single grating 

having  the  same  parameters  as  those  given  above.    In  both  cases,  a  very  good 

agreement  was  obtained  between  the  analytical  calculation  and  the  numerical 

simulation.  The  smoother  nature  of  the  longer  array  is  obvious,  as  the  averaging 

action over many gratings is more uniformly spread. One can view the array output 

spectrum as being composed from all grating pairs making many random Fabry-Perot 

etalons. The output is the collective spectra which gradually lose the individual Fabry-

Perot characteristic as the light passes more gratings. Fig. 2.3 shows the evolution of 

the  transmitted  intensity  at  the  band  center  after  each  grating.  Here,  too,  the  good 

agreement  between  the  analytical  calculation  and  the  numerical  simulation  is  well 

observed.

2.3   Destructive Interference of the High Order Reflections  

It is possible to consider the total transmission as an infinite sum of waves formed by 

multiple  reflections  and  transmissions  consisting  of  different  optical  paths,  and 

different phases. Fig. 2.4 is an example of a system built out of six randomly-spaced 

gratings.  The  figure  exemplifies  three  waves  with  exactly  the  same  overall  path 

length, but with different number of transmissions and reflections. Nevertheless, due 

to the phase difference between the reflection coefficient of the forward and backward 

propagating  waves,  the  two  upper  waves  interfere  constructively,  however  the  third 

8 

 

 

wave  interferes  destructively  with  the  upper  two.  The  fascinating  result  of  the 

localization  theory  is  that  for  large  arrays  the  overall  interference  of  the  all  multi-

reflections  in  the  transmitted  light  is  fully  destructive.  Therefore,  the  total 

transmission is comprised only of the wave that passes through all elements without 

being reflected. 

The phase difference between the reflection coefficients for opposite wave incidence 

at  an  optical  element  is  general.  We  are  familiar  with  the  opposite  sign  of  the 

reflection  coefficients  for  opposite  incident  waves  at  a  boundary  of  two  media  with 

different refractive indices.  More generally it can be tracked in the relation mentioned 

in section 2.1:  r'ntn

* + rn

* t'n

* = 0.  For these optical elements |rn|=|r'n|, tn= t'n and for 

specific choice of the reference planes of the waves at the two sides of the element, 

arg (tn ) = arg (t'n ) =0 , and then obtain rn = −r'n .

2.4   Ray Theory for Disordered System  

We show here the simple ray theory approach, that could have been naively expected 

to  be  adequate  for  the  disordered  system,  but  in  fact  it  leads  to  wrong  results.  The 

development follows the work by Berry and Klein [5] given here to clarify the basic 

wave nature responsible for the localization effect. Ray theory approach is based upon 

the assumption that the waves in a disordered system are incoherent; and therefore can 

be represented as intensities rather than amplitudes. The appropriate matrix formalism 

can  be  obtained  for  the  ray  theory,  referring  to  incident  and  reflected  intensities.

It  is  a  linear  decay,  or  Ohmic  like  behavior  for  (1/TN) ∝ N  ,  (for  large  N),  which  is 

fundamentally  different  from  the  exponential  dependence  results  from  localization 

theory. Fig. 2.5 shows graphically the transmissivity in the two approaches. 

The different and misunderstood result of the ray theory lays in the fact that regarding 

waves  as  incoherent  and  averaging  over  random  phases  is  not  equivalent.  This 

difference  is  exemplified  in  section  2.3:  although  propagating  in  a  random  medium, 

different  light  wave  paths  of  the  same  lengths  "magically"  give  precise  destructive 

interferences.  Thus,  the  assumption  that  the  scattered  waves  have  no  phase 

correlation, and therefore can be regarded as incoherent, is false.  Furthermore, exact 

wave averaging shows that all transmitted waves (except for the one passing without 

any  reflection)  interfere  destructively,  leading  to  the  exponential  decay  of  the 

transmissivity. It is also noteworthy that the ray theory does give a correct result when 

the  waves  interference  is  not  dominant.  This  can  occur  when  the  reflection  is  very 

small and the system is small enough so even small reflections would not accumulate.

2.5   Comparison to Ordered Gratings 

It is interesting to compare the random grating system to ordered grating. It seems that 

we have a powerful method to obtain effectively long gratings, winning with the easy 

fabrication  of  random  structures  that  might  have  been  regarded  as  a  spoiling  factor, 

but  turns  out  to  be  an  advantage  with  the  support  of  the  localization  effect  that 

provides  a  strong  transmission  decay  and  high  reflection.  Then,  not  only  that  the 

random  grating  arrays  are  easy  to  fabricate,  but  disturbances  don't  have  much 

deteriorating effect on their performance. On the other hand, long ordered gratings are 

hard to fabricate and can have detrimental environment effect. The situation is even 

worse for ordered grating arrays, which are almost impossible to implement even for a 

small number of gratings, since they need precise interferometric spacing between the 

gratings. An additional advantage of the random arrays is that they can easily provide 

very  large  bandwidths  for  the  reflection,  since  they  depend  on  the  single  grating 

bandwidth. The single grating can be made very short (10-100 µm long) and still be 

an  effective  scatterer,  thus  providing  very  large  wavelength  bandwidths  of  tens  of 

nanometers. One can then argue that for even larger bandwidths, why not to take it to 

the  ultimate  situation  by  forming  point  scatterers  rather  then  short  gratings.  Such 

random point scatterer arrays are of course interesting and worth for implementation, 

though it is not easy to make. It needs the fabrication of many random scatterers along 

the  fiber.  For  reaching  the  asymptotic  noiseless  localization  regime,  we  need  a 

reasonable number of scatteres. It means that the strength of one scatterer ought to be 

weak  to  allow  the  laser  to  penetrate  and  acquire  many  multi-reflections  which 

averages to zero in the transmitted light. On the other hand, the fabrication of many 

scatterers is more complicated and therefore we need a reasonable scattering strength 

12 

  

for  each  element  to  be  able  to  observe  the  effect.    We  also  mention  some 

disadvantages  of  the  random  array.  The  transmission  and  the  reflection  and  their 

spectra  aren't  smooth  and  uniform,  as  the  averaging  in  a  random  structure  which  is 

limited in length, is not optimal. We need a rather long array to reach the smoother 

asymptotic behavior. The last point in the ordered-disordered gratings comparison is 

that gratings are mostly used for precise filtering purposes and not only for reflection, 

and thus the ordered element is needed, unless we look for special filtering uses, or 

with special finger prints.   

 

 

For  a  comparison  between  the  disordered  array  and  ordered  structures,  like  long 

uniform gratings, we take them to be of the same overall length L=N . We can also 

0L

extend the comparison to ordered arrays of N gratings, each of length

0L

, with exactly 

the same spacing between them. We note that the latter structure is almost impossible 

to implement even for low number of gratings, because of the sub-wavelength spacing 

requirement.  

We use Eq. 2.2 for the transmisivity of long uniform grating, replacing 

0L

 by L, and 

then compare the outcome to the random grating result. For the ordered grating array 

we  can  again  start  with  the  transfer  matrix  formalism,  using  Eqs.  2.4  and  2.7,  and 

setting equal spacing, d

i =d. This structure include the ordered grating case for d=0. 

Then the transfer matrix for a set of N gratings is:

For large N, in all cases, the disordered array, ordered array with optimal spacing, and single

The  exponent  in  the  ordered  case  strongly  depends  on  the  grating  spacing  selection.  The 

strongest reflection is given by the single long grating which has a built in equal spacing zero 

phase, but anyhow such arrays are difficult to implement. The great surprise is the result for 

disordered  arrays  that  gives  exponential  dependence  and  accordingly  high  reflectivity, 

although having its own drawbacks as we describe below. 

 

 

 

 

 

3.  The Experiment: System, Measurements and Results 

We  turn  to  the  experimental  study.  We  first  describe  the  setup  for  the  grating 

fabrication  and  then  the  system  for  measuring  the  transmission  of  the  randomly-

spaced  gratings.  The  first  setup  includes  a  UV  laser  that  is  used  for  grating

fabrication,  set  of  lenses  that  are  used  to  shape  the  laser  beam,  mask  to  create  the 

grating  pattern,  moving  table  and  controller  for  fiber  placement,  and  single  mode 

fiber.  The  second  setup  is  comprised  of  an  Erbium-Doped  Fiber  Amplifier  (EDFA) 

that  is  used  as  a  source  for  the  transmission  measurement,  and  an  optical  spectrum 

analyzer for conducting the measurements. We then present the measured results that 

include  the  transmission  spectral  behavior  and  the  dependence  on  the  number  of 

gratings.  We  also  show  measurements  for  deducing  the  one  grating  transmissivity, 

needed  for  the  theory  verification.  At  the  end  of  this  chapter  we  discuss  the  results 

with a comparison to the localization theory.  

 

 

3.1 The Experimental System: Grating Fabrication and Measurement Setup 

The method used to fabricate the gratings is based on a near contact exposure through a phase 

mask [22]. The setup is illustrated in Fig. 3.1.  The UV laser source is an Argon Ion laser of 

which frequency is doubled by a nonlinear crystal to give a wavelength of 248nm and power 

of about 200mW. The beam is broadened by a concave lens in order to produce a spot size 

large enough to illuminate the slit on the mask as uniformly as possible without significantly 

reducing the beam intensity.  Then, the beam is focused in the fiber axis by a cylindrical lens 

in order to maximize the intensity exposing the fiber. The beam emerging from the cylindrical 

lens is normally incident on a slit attached to the mask and transfers only 1mm of the beam 

(the slit is adjusted to pass the interval with the maximum intensity).  The slit and mask are 

placed approximately at the focal point of the cylindrical lens to achieve maximum intensity 

on the fiber that is adjacent to the mask. The exposing beam is then normally incident on the 

phase mask and diffracted entirely. The grating is formed by the interference between the +1 

and -1 diffracted orders of the phase mask. It was a single mode fiber that was put for a few 

days  inside  a  high-pressure  Hydrogen  tank  to  make  it  sensitive  to  photoinduced  refractive 

index change.

Figure 3.1:  The experimental setup: UV laser beam, aligned to a pinhole, is broadened by a 
lens in order to achieve larger spot size for the grating writing.  The beam is then focused at 
the fiber axes by a cylindrical lens to obtain maximum intensity on the fiber.  A phase grating, 
diffraction gives two 1st order waves, causing a sinusoidal interfering pattern on the fiber. The 
light  transmission  measurements  in  the  fiber  were  done  in-situ  after  each  additional  grating 
fabrication.  This  procedure  allowed  us  to  follow  the  localization  buildup  with  the  grating 
number. 

3.2 Light Transmission Measurements 

In order to achieve reproducibility of the grating spectrum, it was necessary to assure 

that the exposure time would be similar for  all gratings.  Therefore, the laser power 

was  adjusted  to  achieve  a  relatively  slow  grating  formation  time  in  order  to  render 

good accuracy. 

The following procedure was repeated for each grating: 

16 

  

•  The illumination was started. 

•  After 1 minute, the illumination was stopped and the spectrum was recorded. 

•  The automated stage controller was adjusted to move the fiber holding stage a 

random distance (that was larger than the grating). 

•  The above procedure was repeated 55 times. 

It  is  noteworthy  to  mention  that  the  maximum  number  of  55  gratings  was  due  to 

limitations  of  the  spectrum  analyzer  accuracy  as  the  transmitted  light  intensity 

decreased with the grating number. The measurement results of the spectrum as well 

as the intensity are shown in Figs. 3.2-3.5. The experiment was carried out twice for a 

slightly different exposure time and slightly different grating length (by modifying the 

distance between the mask and the fiber).  The spectra in Figs 3.2 and 3.4 show the 

detailed wavelength dependence in the grating bandwidth and the gradual loss of the 

individual Fabry-Perot spectrum along the propagation while acquiring the many and 

random Fabry-Perot characteristic. 

 

 

The  transmitted  power  measurements  shown  in  Figs.  3.4  and  3.5  were  done  at  the 

center  of  the  grating  spectrum,  where  the  transmission  is  minimal,  and  has  been 

averaged over 0.5nm in Experiment no. 1 and over 0.3nm in Experiment no. 2.  The 

reason  for  this  averaging  stems  from  the  need  to  overcome  the  random  fluctuations 

and  temperature  and  stress  changes  experienced  by  the  fiber  during  the  experiment, 

causing the measured spectrum to drift and vary. The averaging interval, on one hand, 

was chosen to be large enough to suppress those environmental changes, but on the 

other, as the transmissivity magnitude varies with wavelength, the interval had to be 

limited  to  a  length  at  which  the  maximum  difference  in  transmission  could  be 

tolerated.    In  more  explicit  terms,  if  the  grating  minimum  transmissivity  is  ~0.4dB, 

17 

then an accuracy of one magnitude less is tolerable.  Furthermore, the noise caused by 

the  optical  amplifier  and  the  spectrum  analyzer  accuracy  results  in  a  measured 

accuracy no better then 0.02dB.

3.3 Experiment vs. Theory 

Section  2  provided  the  theoretical  asymptotic  behavior  of  the  transmission  with  the 

exponential decay given by τN = exp [-N ln(1/τ)], where τ is the intensity transmission 

coefficient  of a single grating. Therefore, in order to compare the theoretical results 

with the findings obtained from the experiments, it is necessary to first find τ at the 

point  in  the  spectrum  where  the  transmission  measurements  were  taken.  This  single 

grating value is to be compared to the experimental decay rate of the complete grating 

array transmissivity. 

Measuring  the  transmissivity  of  a  single  grating  can  be  performed  by  one  of  two 

methods.    The  first  and  most  straightforward  method  is  to  take  the  result  obtained 

from measuring the spectrum of the first grating and normalizing it according to the 

spectrum measured for a grating-free fiber (that is basically the power spectrum of the 

EDFA).  This method has a great disadvantage as it features wide inaccuracy caused 

by a power drift that may occur between the two measurements as a consequence of 

fiber banding, polarization dependent loss, and instability of the source power.  While 

the  drift  caused  by  these  effects  is  tolerable  for  most  of  the  experiment  when 

suppressing  it  to  values  of  ~0.1dB  by  maintaining  a  relatively  constant  temperature, 

vibration-free  environment,  and  minimized  fiber  movement  during  the  experiment, 

this is not the case when measuring the first grating as the minimum transmission is in 

a  mere  tenths  of  dB.  The  second  method  is  to  measure  the  transmission  of  two 

gratings, which is a form of Fabry-Perot, and extracting from it the transmissivity of a 

single grating.  Although this method is less straightforward, it has a great advantage 

over the previous one as all the effects causing the inaccuracy of the previous method 

are  negligible.    This  is  because  the  measurement  is  performed  at  a  specific,  given 

time,  without  necessitating  measurement  of  the  reference  level.  To  achieve  good 

21 

 

  

accuracy,  the  second  method  was  selected.    It  is  now  possible  to  derive  the 

transmissivity of a single grating from the spectrum measurement of two successive 

gratings. Although the Fabry-Perot properties are simple and known, we derive them 

here  by  using  the  transfer  matrix  method.  The  transfer  matrix  of  two  successive 

gratings with a spacing d between them is:

The  grating  pair  measurements  of  the  normalized  transmission  spectra  are  shown  in

The  value  τmin  is  the  square  root  of  the  minimum  transmissivity  at  the  center  of  the 

grating spectrum. It is –1.63 dB for experiment 1 and –1.41dB for experiment 2. Then, 

for Experiment 1, according to Eq. 3.1, the transmissivity of a single grating is –0.43 

dB.  For Experiment 2 it is –0.35dB. According to the localization theory these values

are  to  be  compared  to  the  overall  transmission  slope  that  are  –0.405  dB/grating  in 

experiment 1, and –0.326  dB/grating for experiment 2.

3.4 Loss 

Throughout the study, it was assumed that loss is negligible.  This assumption should 

be confirmed experimentally since although the loss of the fiber itself for such short 

distances  is  negligible,  the  process  of  grating  fabrication  might  introduce  some 

additional losses in the grating formation with the exposure to the UV radiation that 

changes  the  fiber  uniformity  and  the  absorption  coefficient.  In  order  to  confirm  that 

the exponential decay indeed resulted from localization, and not from loss, the fiber 

loss  was  measured  after  the  grating  fabrication.    The  experiment  setup  is  given  in 

Figure  3.8,  where  one  end  of  the  tested  fiber  was  connected  to  a  spectrum  analyzer 

through a 3dB attenuator and 50% coupler, and the other end to the EDFA through a 

50% coupler.  The intensity measured at the coupler output tap was one-quarter of the 

reflection from the tested fiber plus one-quarter of the transmission.  To evaluate the 

loss,  a  measurement  was  made  of  the  spectrum  at  the  coupler  output  tap  using  a 

regular fiber, and then repeated using the tested fiber. Assuming that a regular fiber 

can  be  used  as  reference  for  a  loss-free  fiber,  the  maximum  measured  difference 

between the spectrum of the regular fiber and the tested fiber was less then 0.5dB for 

all  wavelengths.    As  the  total  transmission  measured  was  ~  −20dBm  it  may  be 

deduced that the fabricated fiber loss is negligible.

is rerouted back to the left coupler.  Half of the reflection is then present at the left tap of the 
right coupler, and coupled to half of the transmission from the tested fiber.  The right tap of 
the  right  coupler  is  connected  to  the  spectrum  analyzer  and  measures  one-quarter  of  the 
reflection plus the transmission. EDFA is the erbium doped fiber amplifier serves for the light 
source, OSA is the optical spectrum analyzer.

Table 3.1:  Summary of Experiment Results 

The  slight  difference  between  the  transmission  of  a  single  grating  and  the  total 

transmission  slope  results  from:  (a)  The  gratings  are  not  exactly  equivalent,  and 

therefore the transmission of a single grating (as measured from the first two gratings) 

can deviate from the average transmission of the gratings. (b) The trasnmission slope

is  a  consequence  of  a  calculation  that  evaluates  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  the 

transmission.    For  a  finite  system  the  transmissivity  fluctuates,  deviating  from  the 

asymptotic  calculation.  (c)  Measurement  uncertainties,  such  as  temperature,  fiber 

stress, polarization dependent loss. (d) Stability of the EDFA. 

 

 

4.  Summary 

We  have  presented  a  realization  of  Anderson  localization  with  light  propagating  in 

one-dimensional randomly spaced gratings in a single mode fiber. We described the 

theoretical  analysis  and  experimentally  demonstrated  the  localization  effect.  We 

measured  the  transmissivity  with  the  exponential  decay  along  the  disordered  fiber 

gratings.  The magnitude of the decay rate, i.e., inverse localization length, is equal to 

the  log  of  the  inverse  single  grating  transmissivity.  The  total  transmission  is 

comprised only of the wave that passes through all gratings without experiencing any 

reflections.  All  other  transmitted  waves  interfere  destructively  for  the  transmission. 

We discussed a ray approach that treats the waves as incoherent due to averaging over 

random phases in the disordered array, but it fails to adequately describe the special 

wave interference nature. 

We conclude with the application sides of the random grating array. We refer to the 

reflection  side,  complementary  to  the  transmission  that  can  become  very  large  with 

the  strong  localization  effect.  Ordered  gratings  with  their  filtering  and  reflection 

capabilities  are  widely  used  in  fiber-optics.  However  it  is  very  difficult  to  fabricate 

gratings longer than a few cm. Random grating arrays are by far easier to make with 

much larger lengths. Here the random nature becomes an advantage. However, even 

most  important  feature  is  that  the  random  array  can  easily  provide  very  large 

bandwidth  reflection,  since  it  depends  on  the  single  grating  bandwidth  that  can  be

made  very  short,  thus  providing  very  large  wavelength  bandwidths  of  tens  of 

nanometers.  Another  interesting  possibility  is  the  use  for  fiber  lasers.  The  random 

grating  can  provide  the  pseudo  cavity  for  feedback,  thus  providing  a  kind  of  1D

Abstract  This paper continues the development of a discrete space-time concept that is

recently used in the explanation of the cosmological constant. Instead of order estimation, a

more theoretical treatment of the theory is introduced.  Based on  the discrete  space-time

hypothesis, we find that the electroweak theory and General Relativity can be combined

into a single theory. An analytical form of the cosmological constant can be found and the

weakness problem of the gravitational constant can also be explained.

PACS numbers: 98.80.Cq, 04.60.-m

In  a  recent  theory  [1],  we  proposed  that  the  mystery  of  the  cosmological  constant

problem (some recent review on the problem can be found in [2,3,4]) can be resolved by the

assumption of discrete space-time. Although G.’t Hooft  had proposed that a discrete nature

of space-time can be derived by combining certain features of General Relativity (GR) and

quantum mechanics [5], we treat it as a hypothesis for simplicity. Based on the following

three hypotheses:  (1) Space-time  is discrete  in  nature  and  its  fundamental  unit  is of  the

order of Planck scale; (2) The space-time forms a kind of phase (or say “condensate”) with

its constituents; (3) The scalar field in electroweak theory plays both the role as the order

parameter of such space-time phase and the wavefunction of its constituents, it is shown

that space-time is discrete in the electroweak scale. The cosmological constant  estimated

by the theory is in excellent agreement with the Type Ia SN observations [6,7]. The most

recent  analysis  of  SN1997ff  also  confirms  such  results  [8].    Besides,  the  theory  has

important  implication  on  the  problems  other  than  the  cosmological  constant.  Firstly,

cosmic inflation is just a consequence of the theory. Secondly, the universe is found to be

alternatively  dominated  by  the  cosmological  constant  and  the  mass  density  at  different

cosmic time  period. Our calculation  also shows  that the  matter  energy density 

ρ is  of

m

similar order of magnitude as the vacuum energy density 

ρ  in the present universe but it is

v

just a coincidence. This result supports the anthropic principle [9]. The theory of discrete

space-time also opens a new direction in quantum gravity. It is because if the space-time is

made of more fundamental unit or constituents, the divergence problem of the quantum

gravity would be of no interest since  µνg  is not a fundamental field and General Relativity

is just a collective effect of the lattice like vibration of the space-time constituents. In this

paper,  we  continue  the  development  of  the  discrete  space-time  concept  and  try  to  give

mathematical description on the theory and construct a more detail model on the space-

time microscopic structure. The value of the gravitational constant and its weakness are

also explained.

If  the  space-time  manifold  is  made  of  more  fundamental  constituents  which  are

subjected to quantum mechanical effects, a new definition of the metric may be needed to

describe  both  the  quantum  behaviour  of  the  constituents  in  microscopic  scale  and  their

macroscopic  effect  as  a  smooth  manifold.  Let  us  define  a  new  generalized  metric  that
involves the contribution of a φ  field as

g

where φ( )x  is the field “related to” the wavefunction of the constituent (later we will show

that the  φ field is not exactly equal to the wavefunction of the space-time constituent but

the “holes” of it does).  µνg  is defined to be the metric which is independent to the φ field.

Although the mathematical form of equation (1) is similar to the conformal transformation

on  µνg ,  we  treat  φ  as  a  real  physical  field  in  our  theory  rather  than  just  a  conformal

function. The introduction of the  φ field in the metric here will create some new space-

time  concepts.  Firstly,  if  the  symmetry  of  the  φ  field  is  spontaneously  broken  and  its

vacuum expectation value (VEV) takes a constant value, the distribution of the space-time
constituents of the manifold is uniform. Secondly, different symmetry broken stages of  φ

forms different “phase” of the space-time in which the density of the constituents may be

different, as described in the previous paper [1]. The space-time of the present universe
could  be  just  in  one  of  the  broken  phase  of  φ  since  the  density  of  the  space-time

constituents is expected to be uniform. Using these concepts, we will later show that GR

and electroweak theory can be combined into a single theory such that the vacuum state

described  in  electroweak  theory  is  just  the  “phase”  of  the  space-time  and  its  transition
properties is determined by the  φ field.

Let us assume the conformal transformation of  µνg  and  φ as 

g

and

φ

.  g' µν in equation(1) is then a conformal invariant and the scale of  µνg  is not

determined before fixing the value of  φ. If we put  g' µνof equation (1) into the usual GR

action, a generalized conformal invariant action can be obtained as

where R x( ) is the Ricci scalar corresponding to the metric g µν. If we varies the action with

respect  to  g µν,  a  conformal  invariant  equation  can  be  obtained.  Through  that  equation,

when φ  takes a constant value, for example, φ

0 , the coupling constant becomes κ φ/

the relationship between R  & λ  can be found as R = 4

Now, if we make use of the above hypothesis (1) that the space-time manifold is made of

some  fundamental  unit,  we  expect  that  R   would  tend  to  be  a  constant  R0  and  be

independent  with  g µν  when  the  space-time  is  about  that  length  scale.  This  situation  is

similar to a Ricci scalar defined on an elastic membrane with atomic structure. The Ricci

scalar  describes  the  curvature  of  the  membrane  and  is  a  function  of  the  metric

macroscopically but it decouple with the metric in atomic scale due to the domination of

curvature by individual atom. On fixing the Ricci scalar,  the conformal symmetry of the

action will be broken and the scale of the metric can be fixed. However, one may find that

the metric  g µν cannot be determined solely by the action in equation (4) afterwards and it

should be find by the macroscopic equation. That means we have to build the metric in

macroscopic  scale  in  order  to  describe  the  field  of  the  microscopic  constituent.  This

situation  can  be  analogous  to  the  description  of  the  phonon  propagation  on  a  curved

membrane and, in general, the case is not difficult for the fundamental scale of the space-

time since the background metric can be assumed to be locally flat and therefore it is of

Minkowski type in nature. In obtaining the macroscopic equation,  R  is still a function of

the metric and the action is conformal invariant. If we fix the coupling strength of metric
and  break  the  conformal  symmetry  by  choosing  φ= 1,  the  action  becomes  the  one

commonly used in GR so that the metric can be found. (We will later show that fixing the

coupling strength is directly related to fixing the size of the constituents). The conformal

symmetry broken in different scale does not pose us problem here because, in general, the

symmetry broken in microscopic scale can be approximately retained in macroscopic scale

due to the smoothing out of large amount of microscopic particle. This can be analogous to

the continuous translation symmetry of an infinite atomic lattice. Such symmetry is broken

in atomic scale but approximately be retained in macroscopic scale. So that, we can further

break  the  macroscopic  symmetry  by  some  other  means.  Therefore,  the  translation

symmetry is doubly broken in macroscopic and microscopic scale. The above argument is

an important step that we can combine GR with electroweak theory by the discrete space-

time hypothesis because the action in equation (3) converge in microscopic scale to the

lagrangian for a scalar field, that can be identified as the one used in electroweak theory,

and it becomes the GR action in macroscopic scale. However, the lagrangian differs from

the usual electroweak theory by an overall negative sign. This problem can be solved by

using the concept of holes in the solid state physics to describe the constituent. Although
the field concerned is now a scalar (i.e. Pauli exclusion principle does not apply), the ψ

field has a constant density on symmetry breaking as a condensate and therefore any defects

on the field will behave as “holes” in such condensate. If the potential term is a constant 

0V

at the ground state of the space-time phase when it is filled up with the ψ field, then the

lagrangian of a defect or “holes” of the ψ field on the manifold can be written as

theory where µ and  g  are related as

 and also, 

0V  can be assumed to be zero.

We have to remark that the above identification is true only when  R  is independent with

g µν  and  be  a  constant  R0  as  assumed  in  extreme  microscopic  scale.  Therefore,  the  λ

appears  here  is  not  representing  the  macroscopic  observed  cosmological  constant.

Equation (7) gives the relations that bring together GR with the electroweak theory. We can

further find that

From the above calculation, we know that GR and electroweak theory could be the

same theory on different length scale and  R0 is directly related to 2µ . R0 can be interpreted

as the curvature of the fundamental space-time unit. If we put the symmetry broken field

This value represents the vacuum energy density of the space-time fundamental unit when

the symmetry is broken  at electroweak energy  scale. It is not  the value in  cosmological

observation since we have to weighed it through the continuous space as described in the
previous paper [1]. From the discussion of equation (5), we know that the “holes” of the ψ

field represents the space-time constituent and is denoted as ψ

h. If the probability density

of the ψ field can be written as  ρ

ψ = 2

ψ

  as usual in scalar field (where  q  is the energy

of a scalar particle), then the probability for the “holes” field ψ

h is as  ρ

2 . Since

the ψ

h field represents the wavefunction of the space-time constituent, the number density

of the space-time contituent is given by the  ρψ

 expression. As in the Dirac’s holes theory

for positron, we assume that the “holes” for the constituent is due to a defect of the state of
the ψ field with negative energy state. So that we let

q ν=

  and  the

. The energy  q  behaves as the binding energy of

the constituent but it is not equal Higgs mass because energy gap may exist between the

vacuum and the Higgs excitation state of the constituent. It is interesting to note that if the

Higgs  mass  is  about 

115

GeV

(although  not  yet  confirmed  in  the  LEP  experiment  of

CERN), the energy gap can be found as  GeV

86

(

109

 is used) which is about the

.0=g

average mass of the W & Z particle. By the most fundamental hypothesis of our theory, the

dimension of the space-time constituent is of the order of Planck scale so that the weighing

factor for converting the microscopic vacuum energy density to macroscopic case can then

be found as

. This verifies

the estimation in the previous paper [1]. We have to introduce the factor  k  here because the

actual size of the space-time constituent is still unknown and it can represent the radius of

the  constituent  in  faction  of  Planck  scale.    However,  we  will  then  show  that  such

information is already in GR.

The  value  given  in  equation  (14)  is  close  to  the  observation  value  by  one  order  of

magnitude. This one order discrepancy could be due to the uncertainty in the geometrical

assumption, the deviation from Euclidean geometry in extreme small scale or some other

unknown reason. Therefore, further investigation should be needed on this point. On the

other hand, we can treat the problem in a reverse way. If we assume that the size of the
constituent is unknown, we can then determine it by the cosmological observation of the λ

m

value. It provides the ground for an experimental determination of the size of the space-
time constituent by the cosmological observation of the λ

m. This is a very impressive point

in our theory.

Besides finding the value of the cosmological constant, the above calculation also

explains the weakness of the gravitational constant. We can observe that the gravitational

constant  acts  like  the  interaction  cross  section  of  vacuum  energy  on  the  space-time
constituents.  This  makes  its  dimension  as  a  cross  sectional  area  (using  h = =c 1).    Its

weakness is due to the extremely small cross sectional area of the constituent when the

space-time is assumed to be discrete. Since its origin is the size of the constituent, its nature

may be more fundamental than other coupling constant. We can now say that the dimension

of the  gravitational  constant  may not  the  major  barrier  to the  quantization  of  gravity  or

make  it  renormalizable.  As  we  mentioned  in  the  previous  paper,  the  discrete  nature  of

space-time makes the metric becomes a kind of collective field and the coupling constant

becomes a cross sectional area. This situation makes the direct quantization of the metric

meaningless.  In  this  point  of  view,  previous  method  of  quantum  gravity  may  be  in  the

wrong  direction  and  not  straight  to  the  problem.  We  propose  that  a  quantum  theory  of

gravity should be based on the quantization of the space-time constituent field since it is the

actual fundamental field of the space-time.

We now have a more theoretical treatment on the reason of why the electroweak

scale and the Planck scale can enter the expression of the cosmological constant by the

discrete  space-time  hypothesis.  Although  most  of  the  physical  meaning  has  been

introduced in the previous paper [1] but now we have a more formal and mathematical

treatment on it. In the mathematical process, we know that the lagrangian for Higgs scalar

and  GR  can  actually  be  combined  into  a  single  theory  and  the  field  for  the  space-time

constituent is just the scalar field in electroweak theory. This explains the physical meaning

of the existence of a scalar field in the vacuum and why such field can take the role in the

inflation theory [10]. In more detail physical description, the space-time constituents can be
interpreted  as  the  “holes”  embedded  in  the  “sea”  of  the  ψ  field  which  exerts  negative

pressure  on  such  “holes”  and  gives  the  cosmological  constant.  If  the  energy  density

increase  to  above  the  electroweak  energy  scale  and  the  space-time  phase  transition

happens, large amount of constituents will be excited as Higgs particle and left with high

density  of  “holes”.  This  makes  the  corresponding  cosmological  constant  has  a  large

increase  as  described  in  our  previous  paper.  This  process  acts  like  external  energy  is

absorbed to become the vacuum energy. In the reverse cooling process, Higgs particle loss

its energy and combined with the “holes” by creating other particle with positive energy

and the cosmological constant decreases due to lower density of holes. This implies the

relation between the matter energy density and the vacuum energy density during the phase

transition as 

∆

 and verifies our description in our previous paper.  The

weakness of the gravitational constant can also be explained by the smallness size of the

constituents as a consequence. It enters the gravitational field equation as the interaction

cross  section  of  the  matter  density  to  the  constituents.  In  view  of  the  theory,  the

phenomenon of accelerating universe may hint us that space-time is discrete in nature and

the information of the space-time microscopic structure can be obtained from cosmological

observations. This point is impressive but not too unfamiliar to us since previous scientists

had also developed the atomic theory of matter from macroscopic phenomenon, such as

kinetic  properties  of  gas  and  diffusion.  Also,  from  the  experience  of  atomic  theory  and

quantum theory of black body, theoretical infinities may imply some discrete nature. We

propose that it may also be true for space-time in quantum gravity. At least, it is a viable

direction for us to pursue further.

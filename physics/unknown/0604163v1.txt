ABSTRACT  On the basis of empirical Fischer projections, we developed an algebraic approach to 

central molecular chirality of tetrahedral molecules. The elements of such an algebra are obtained 

from  the  24  projections  which  a  single  chiral  tetrahedron  can  generate  in  S  and  R  absolute 

configurations. They constitute a matrix representation of the O(4) orthogonal group. According to 

this  representation,  given  a  molecule  with  n  chiral  centres,  it  is  possible  to  define  an  “index  of 

chirality

number of permutations observed under rotations and superimpositions of the tetrahedral molecule 

to its mirror image. The chirality index, not only assigns the global chirality of a given tetrahedral 

chain,  but  indicates  also  a  way  to  predict  the  same  property  for  new  compounds,  which  can  be

Chirality  is  an  underlying  feature  for  physical  systems  ranging  from  elementary  particles  and 
molecules,1 to macroscopic systems as spiral galaxies.2 It can be discussed as a symmetry emerging 

in  abstract  spaces  (such  as  the  configuration  space  of  particles)  or  in  physical  3D-space  of 
stereochemistry.3 However, up today, an unifying view of this fundamental symmetry has not been 

achieved. The reason of this lack is, in our opinion, that a general theoretical approach has not been 

developed yet. In this report, we want to show that, at least for tetrahedral molecules, an algebraic 

description is realized considering the bonds as complex numbers in polar form and the empirical 

Fischer  projections  as  the  elements  of  a  4D  configuration  space.  Such  an  approach  leads  to  the 

definition  of  a  chirality  index  capable  of  fully  characterizing  central  molecular  chirality  of 

tetrahedral  chains.  Besides,  this  chirality  index  can  be  used  to  build  up  compounds  in  a  sort  of 

Aufbau process where global chirality of products is consistently predicted. The paper is organized 

as  follows.  As  first  step,  a  tetrahedral  molecule  is  geometrically  described  by  complex  numbers. 

The main feature which emerges from this description is the fact that the  complex coniugation of 

two  numbers  can  be  directly  related  to  the  inversion  between  two  bonds  occurring  in  a  chiral 

transformation. The final result of these considerations is that the chirality of a tetrahedral chain is 

assigned by the number  n of  stereogenic centres  and the  number p of permutations. Enantiomers, 

diastereoisomers and achiral molecules are  easily classified through this rule. Moreover, we show 

that Fischer projections of a given tetrahedron are nothing else but the elements of the orthogonal 

O(4)  group  which  allows  to  represent  rotations  and  inversions  as  matrix  operators  acting  on  the 

Finally, taking into account all these results, an Aufbau rule can be deduced. In general, it allows to 

construct any simply connected tetrahedron assigning the chirality of the final compounds. 

GEOMETRICAL REPRESENTATION OF TETRAHEDRAL MOLECULES

assuming  simply  connected  tetrahedra.  If  atoms,  acting  as  “spacers”,  are  present  between  chiral 

centres,  the  number  of  bonds  changes  from  3n+1  to  4n,  but  the  following  considerations  for 

consecutive connected tetrahedra remain valid. A molecule with n stereogenic centres is then given 

by the sum vector

where  k  is  the  “centre-index”  and  j  is  the  “bond-index”.  Again,  for  any  k,  a  projective  plane  of 

symmetry is defined. The couple of numbers

 assigns the centre in every plane. 

Having  in  mind  the  definition  of  chirality,  the  behaviour  of  the  molecule  under  rotation  and 

superimposition  has  to  be  studied  in  order  to  check  if  the  structure  and  its  mirror  image  are 

superimposable.  Chirality  emerges  when  two  molecules  with  identical  structural  formulas  are  not 

superimposable. Considering the geometrical representation reported in Fig.1, a possible situation is 

a rotation of 180° in the space around a generic axis passing through the stereogenic centre. Such an 

axis can coincide, for the sake of simplicity, with one of the bonds. After the rotation, two bonds 

result surimposable while the other two are inverted. The situation is depicted by the projection on 

the plane {x,y} as shown in Fig.2.

In  order  to  observe  the  reflection,  the  four  groups  must  be  of  different  nature.  This  simple 

observation  shows  that  the  chirality  is  related  to  the  inversion  of  two  bonds  in  the  projective 

symmetry plane. Such a treatment can be repeated for any projective symmetry plane which can be 

defined for the n centres. The possible results are that the molecule is fully invariant after rotation(s) 

and  superimposition  with  respect  to  its  mirror  image  (achiral);  the  molecule  is  partially  invariant 

after rotation(s) and superimposition, i.e. some tetrahedra are superimposable while others are not 

(diastereoisomers); the molecule presents an inversion for each stereogenic centre (enantiomers). 

The following rule can be derived: central chirality is assigned by the number χ given by the couple

                                                      (6) 

where  χ is the chirality index, n is the principal chiral number and p the secondary chiral number, 

that is n is the number of stereogenic centres, p is the number of permutations (at most one for any 

n, p that is 

 

centre). The constraint

                                                 (7) 

has to hold. 

This  definition  of  chirality  is  related  to  the  structure  of  the  molecule  and  its  properties  under 

rotations and superimposition.

As an example, the chirality of the amino alcohol in Fig. 3 is reduced to this rule. A permutation is

ALGEBRAIC APPROACH DERIVED FROM FISCHER PROJECTIONS 

Tetrahedral  molecules  can  be  represented  by  the  planar  projection  formulas  known  as  Fischer 
projections.3 The (S)-lactic acid is reported in Fig. 4 as an example. 

By numbering from 1 to 4 the groups around the carbon centre as OH=1, CO2H=2, H=3, CH3=4, 

without taking into account the effective priorities of the groups,3 there are 24 (=4! the number of 

permutations  of  4  ligands  among  4  sites)  projections,  twelve  for  the  S-enantiomer  (Fig.  5)  and 

twelve for the R-enantiomer (Fig.6).

The permutations outlined in Fig. 6 derive from those in Fig. 5 simply by interchanging two groups. 

With these considerations in mind, it is immediate asking for an algebraic structure which can be 

built from Fischer projections. To reduce the Fischer rules to an algebraic structure, we define an 

operator 

kχ  acting on a tetrahedral molecule.5 Take into account one tetrahedron, it can be assigned 

by a column vector  Μ , rewriting Eq. (2) as 

                                                                    (8)

which is the first in Fig.5. The position of the bonds in the column vector (8) are assigned starting 

from the left and proceeding clockwise in the Fischer projection. 

The matrix representation of the projection (1) is assumed as “fundamental”, and the action of 

1χ  

on the column vector  Μ  is the identity operator, that is

The matrices in Table I and II are the elements of a 4-parameter algebra.6 Those in Table I are a 

representation  of  rotations,  while  those  in  Table  II  are  inversions.  Both  sets  constitute  the  group 

O(4)  of  4× 4  orthogonal  matrices.  The  matrices  in  Table  I  are  the  remarkable  subgroup  SO(4)  of 

4× 4 matrices with determinant +1. The matrices in Table II have determinant  1− , being inversions 

(or  reflections).  They  do  not  constitute  a  group  since  the  product  of  any  two  of  them  has 

determinant  1+ .  This  fact  means  that  the  product  of  two  inversions  generates  a  rotation  (this  is 

obvious by inverting both the couples of bonds in a tetrahedron). The 24 matrices in Table I and II 

are not all independent. They can be grouped as different representations of the same operators. In 

fact all matrices, representing the same operator, have the same characteristic polynomial.6 In other 

words,  the  characteristic  equation  of  a  matrix  is  invariant  under  vector  base  changes.  In  the  (+) 

enantiomer case, the characteristic eigenvalue equation is

with  obvious  calculations  depending  on  the  choice  of 

kχ   and 

kχ .  It  is  worth  noting  that  this 

approach, in particular Eqs. (12), (13) and the eigenvalues (14), can be related to the “pseudoscalar 

measurements” used to get information about the structure of chiral molecules in the sense indicated 

by Ruch.7 In fact, a pseudoscalar, in particular its sign, can always be related to optical rotation or 

circular  dichroism  allowing  the  determination  of  the  molecular  chirality.  The  double  sign  of 

eigenvalues (14) is an indication in this sense, because it clearly points out the fact that a molecule 

is passing from a state with a given chirality to the opposite one. However, our λs are not the Ruch’s 

λs. In our case, λ indicates the global chirality state of the molecule, in Ruch’s case, it is a parameter 

describing the ligand. The stereochemical information, in our case, is relative to both enantiomers 

and it is not absolute. 

Eq. (4) can be written as 

These results can be extended to more general cases. For a molecule with n stereogenic centres, we 

can define n planes of projection and the bonds among the centres have to be taken into account.

This selection rule enables a classification of tetrahedral chains by their chiral structure. 

 

MOLECULAR AUFBAU FOR TETRAHEDRAL CHAINS 

An Aufbau process can be derived.8 The building-up process gives rise to a chirality index which 
assigns the intrinsic chiral structure of the final compound. As we have seen, the chirality index  χ 

allows an immediate chiral characterization of a given tetrahedral chain. Let us take into account a 

molecule,  which  is  well-defined  in  its  chiral  feature,  in  the  sense  that,  considering  also  its  mirror 

image,  it  is  clear  to  assess  if  the  molecule  is  an  enantiomer,  a  diastereoisomer  or  an  achiral 

molecule.  After  the  addition  of  a  further  chiral  centre  to  this  structure  and  its  mirror  image,  the 

resulting structure will be

                                   (21) 

where 

10,=∆p

. The chiral properties of the new molecule are assigned by the  p∆  value according 

to the following possibilities. If 

0=∆p

, we can have 

n≡χ

 ⇒ 

≡ nχ
{

f

                         (22) 

in this case, the starting compound is an achiral molecule as well as the final one. 

Again, for 

0=∆p

, we can have 

in this case, the starting molecule is a diastereoisomer, being 

p

, as well as the final structure.

                         (24) 

the starting molecule is an enantiomer, while the final one is a diastereoisomer. 

If 

1=∆p

, the situations can be 

from an achiral molecule, a diastereoisomer is obtained; 

from a diastereoisomer, another diastereoisomer is obtained; 

n≡χ

                      (27) 

from an enantiomer, we get another enantiomer. 

Eqs.  (22)-(27)  take  into  account  all  the  possibilities,  which  can  be  easily  iterated  adding  up  any 

number of chiral centres to a given chain. In the general case, the Aufbau rule is

However,  we  have  to  consider  that  the  rule  works  only  for  simply  connected  tetrahedral  chains, 

where  the  chiral  features  are  well-estabilished  with  respect  to  the  mirror  image.  In  this  sense, 

chirality is not an absolute feature of the molecules. Adding up a chiral centre to a structure gives 

rise to a new molecule, where 

≡χ

. The fact that, in the addition, the variation of p 

can be

 assigns the chiral feature of the new compound.

Figure 8. A degenerate example of Aufbau process consisting in adding up a chiral centre, having identical 

substituents of the starting chiral tetrahedron. 

Last consideration indicates that such an Aufbau approach is working only if the chiral centres are 

different and, in this respect, the procedure is suitable for the description of chiral structures. 

CONCLUSION 

Central  molecular  chirality  can  be  dealt  under  the  standard  of  an  algebraic  approach  where  any 

configuration of tetrahedral chains can be achieved by the matrix operators of O(4) group. 

Geometrically, this means that molecular rotations and inversions are realized by representiong the 

molecule as the superposition of complex numbers in polar form, while the chiral structure is given 

by  the  number  of  stereogenic  centres  and  the  number  of  permutations  of  couples  of  bonds  (both 

these numbers constitute the “chiral index”). 

As a final remark, it is worth stressing that the outlined approach could constitute a way to achieve 

an unifying view of chirality since it is possible to show that it works for microscopic structures as 

elementary particles and huge macroscopic systems as spiral galaxies.

We  propose  and  experimentally  demonstrate  a  single-mode  fiber  length  and 

dispersion  measurement  system  based  on  a  novel  frequency-shifted  asymmetric  Sagnac 

interferometer  incorporating  an  acousto-optic  modulator  (AOM).  By  sweeping  the 

driving frequency of the AOM, which is asymmetrically placed in the Sagnac loop, the 

optical length of the fiber can be determined by measuring the corresponding variation in 

the phase delay between the two counter-propagating light beams. Combined with a high-

resolution  data  processing  algorithm,  this  system  yields  a  dynamic  range  from  a  few 

centimeters to  60km  (limited  by our  availability  of  long  fibers)  with  a  resolution  about 

1ppm for long fibers.

Precise fiber length measurement is important in both optical communication and 

optical  sensing. Examples  include  in-service fiber  line  identification  in  a  complex  fiber 

network1,  and  fiber  chromatic  dispersion  measurement2,  etc.  The  most  common  optical 

length  measurement  techniques  are  the  optical  time  domain  reflectometer  (OTDR)3, 

optical  coherent  domain  reflectometer  (OCDR)4-5,  and  the  optical  frequency  domain 

reflectometer (OFDR)1, 6. These techniques are complicated to implement, and they suffer 

from either a small dynamic range or a low resolution. In contrast, we propose a simple 

approach achieving high resolution over a large dynamic range. Our approach employs a 

frequency  shift  element  in  an  asymmetric  Sagnac  interferometer.  The  basic  idea  is 

simple: light signals of different frequencies experience different phase delays as they go 

through  the  same  fiber.  This  phase  difference,  which  carries  information  of  the  optical 

length of the fiber, can be easily measured using interference.  In our setup, a polarization 

insensitive  fiber-pigtailed  AOM  (Brimrose  Corp.)  was  used  to  achieve  the  frequency 

shift.  The  acoustic  wave  generates  a  propagating  diffraction  grating  inside  the  crystal. 

Consequently, the 1st-order diffracted light is Doppler shifted by an amount equal to the 

frequency of the acoustic signal f 7. 

Figure 1 shows our experimental setup. A 1550 nm, 2mW CW laser is used as the

light source. After passing through a 2x2 symmetric fiber coupler, the laser beam is spilt 

into two parts equally: S1, goes clockwise through the fiber loop, while S2, goes through 

the same fiber loop counterclockwise. The frequencies of both S1 and S2 are up-shifted by 

the same amount when they come back to the fiber coupler, a stable interference signal 

can be observed. A computer with a Data Acquisition card is used to control the function 

2

generator (for driving the AOM) and to read the power from the photo detector. A spool 

of fiber with length LB (~100m) was put in the system intentionally. Also, a polarization 

controller was employed to improve the visibility. 

Since S1 and S2 go through the same loop, ideally, any phase drift or polarization 

fluctuation will be canceled out. In practice, due to the birefringence in the loop, S1 and 

S2  may  experience  different  phase  delays,  and  their  polarization  states  could  also  be 

different after they go through the loop8.  The interference signal can be described by

Where    =2-1  is  the  relative  phase  between  S1  and  S2,  and  the  parameter 

m[0,1] describes the visibility of the interference fringe.

Suppose the wavelength (frequency) of light before and after going through AOM 

are  () and  () respectively.  Define =- and =-. From =C/ and =f,

Where n is refractive index of fiber, L is the length of the test fiber, L1 is the total 

length  of  the  connecting  fiber  from  the  coupler  to  port  A  plus  the  one  from  port  B  to 

AOM and L2 is the fiber length from AOM to coupler. Constant 

0 [0, 2) is introduced 

to take into account the phase difference caused by birefringence in the fiber loop.

Using Eqs.(1), (2) and (3), and considering <<, we can get

is approximately equal to LB (100m). The interference pattern 

V varies periodically with acoustic frequency f. By scanning f while recording V, the fiber 

length L can be determined from the “period” of V with high resolution. The offset fiber 

LB  is  necessary  for  short  fiber  measurement:  Without  it,  the  required  frequency  scan 

range to complete one “period” would be too larger for the AOM. 

We  calculate  the  “period”  of  V from  the  frequency  difference  between  two 

minimum  points 

kf   and 

Nkf  on  the  interference  pattern.  Because  neither  back-

reflections  from  unwanted  surfaces  (which  contribute  to  DC  background  in  the 

interference pattern), nor the long term drift of optical components (such as fiber coupler) 

can change this “period”, our system is quite robust against environment noise. 

From  Eq.  (4),  the  acoustic  frequency  of  the  k-th  minimum  point  in  the 

interference pattern is

The integer N in Eq. (7) can be determined by counting the number of minimums 

between 

kf   and

Nkf 

.  During  the  derivation  of  Eq.(7),  the  unknown  constant 

0   was 

canceled out. Also, the parameter m in Eq.(1) does not show up in Eq.(7). This means our 

4

system  is  insensitive  to  the  birefringence  in  the  fiber  loop,  although  the  use  of  a 

polarization controller can improve the visibility. 

From  Eq.(7),  the  error  of  the  length  measurement  ∆L  is  mainly  caused  by  ∆f, 

which is  the error in  determining  frequencies fk and fk+N. Here ∆f  can be  separated into 

two parts

independent of the fiber length.  From Eq. (4)

We chose kf ~ 50MHz (the lower frequency limit of AOM) while 

Nkf  ~56MHz 

(the  upper  frequency  limit  of  AOM).  For  large  L,  the  second  term  at  the  right  side  of 

Eq.(10) can be neglected, and the length resolution is limited by the frequency resolution 

of  the  function  generator.  For  short  L,  the  contribution  of  the  phase  error  cannot  be 

neglected.

A  LabView  program  was  developed  to  scan  f,  acquire  the  interference  fringe, 

search  for  minimum  points  and  calculate  L.  For  60km  fiber,  the  visibility  is  still  about 

5

93%.  To  calibrate  our  system,  for  short  fibers,  we  used  a  tape  measure,  while  for  long 

fibers, an Agilent 86037C Chromatic Dispersion Test system, whose length resolution is 

0.1%, was used. Spools of Corning SMF28 fiber (from 5m to 60km) were tested. 

The  length  measurement  results  are  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  relative  differences 

between  our  system  and  the  Agilent  system  are  less  than  0.1%  except  for  a  55m  fiber 

spool (0.18%), which we believe is due to the inaccuracy of the Agilent system for short 

fiber.  In  fact,  for  a  5.18m  fiber  (determined  by  tape  measure),  our  system  measured 

5.20m, while the Agilent system measured 5.36m. 

The  resolution  is  defined  as  twice  of  the  standard  deviation.  The  experimental 

results are shown in Figure 3, which match the theoretical model very well.

The high resolution of our system suggests its potential application for chromatic 

dispersion measurement. In principle, by tuning the wavelength of the light source while 

recording  the  optical  length,  the  group  delay 

)( can  be  determined.  The  chromatic 

dispersion can be calculated from 9

A  preliminary  dispersion  measurement  was  conducted  by  employing  a  tunable 

laser  with  a  tuning  range  of  1480nm—1585nm.  Figure  4  shows  a  comparison  between 

the  dispersion  result  obtained  from  our  system  and  that  from  the  Agilent  system.  The 

slight discrepancy may be attributed to the wavelength dependence of the components in 

our system, which was not calibrated.

In conclusion, we proposed and demonstrated a frequency-shifted interferometer, 

which can be used for high-resolution fiber length measurement. With a rather simple and 

robust  setup,  we  achieved  a  resolution  on  the  order  of  10-6 for  long  fibers.  We 

6

demonstrated  a  dynamic  range  of  60km,  which  was  only limited  by  our  availability  of 

long fibers. By tuning the wavelength of the laser source, this system can also be used to 

Financial  support  from  NSERC,  CRC Program,  CFI,  OIT,  PREA,  and  CIPI  is 

measure chromatic dispersion.

Abstract:  This  paper  demonstrates  the  performance  of  planar  geometry  InGaAs/InP  avalanche  diodes, 
specifically designed and fabricated for Geiger-mode operation at wavelengths around 1550nm, in terms of 
dark count rate, single-photon detection efficiency, afterpulsing and photon-timing jitter.

1. Introduction 
 
Single-photon counting and single-photon timing in the infrared spectral range, in particular at 1550nm wavelength, 
have  become  increasingly  important  in  a  number  of  applications  such  as  time-resolved  photoluminescence  [1], 
optical  time-domain  reflectometry  (OTDR)  [2],  eye-safe  time-of-flight  laser  ranging  [3],  object  recognition  and  
imaging [4].  More recently they have been employed in quantum key distribution [5], and non-invasive testing of 
VLSI  circuits  [6].  Commercially  available  InGaAs/InP  avalanche  photodiodes  (APDs)  designed  for  use  in  linear 
multiplication mode have been experimented and investigated in Geiger mode [7,8], in order to extend the spectral 
range of single-photon detection beyond the limit (approximately λ ~ 1000nm) of Si single-photon avalanche diode 
(SPAD)  detectors.  These  devices  exhibit  good  single-photon  detection  efficiency  (SPDE  >  10%)  and  fast  timing, 
with  sub-nanosecond  jitter,  but  they  are  plagued  by  strong  afterpulsing  phenomena,  which  severely  restrict  the 
affordable  counting  rate.    In  the  present  work,  InGaAs/InP  avalanche  diode  with  planar  geometry  have  been 
specifically  designed  and  fabricated  for  developing  single-photon  detectors  operating  in  Geiger-mode.  This  study 
represents  a  fabrication  program  for  planar  InGaAs/InP  SPADs  and  highlights  some  important  issues  in  device 
design.  

 

 

 

2. Device structure and characterization 
 
The SPAD design is based on a planar structure of the type originally devised for APD devices operating in linear 
amplification mode with separate regions of absorption grading and multiplication (SAGM) [9,10], shown in Fig 1.

Two structures were grown and characterized; one with a single quaternary (1Q-SPAD) and another with three 
quaternary layers (3Q-SPAD) to study the effect of grading on single-photon performance at different temperatures. 
For  both  structures  we  measured  the  single-photon  detection  efficiency,  dark  count  rate  (DCR),  afterpulsing 
probability and timing jitter. The performance in terms of noise-equivalent power (NEP) is shown in fig. 2.  NEP is 
a function of both SPDE and DCR and is calculated using the following equation.

In summary, we have developed SPADs for efficient single-photon detection at a wavelength of 1.55µm with a 
SPDE  of  10%  at  200K.  They  have  dark  count  rates  and  noise-equivalent  power  comparable  to  those  previously 
measured for commercially-available avalanche photodiodes operated in Geiger-mode [11]. Photon timing jitter at 
sub-nanosecond  level  has  been  measured;  it  is  estimated  that  it  can  be  further  reduced  through  improved  ohmic 
contacts to the detector, as well as improved packaging. We investigated the effect of the grading layer on the SPDE 
and  fully  tested  the  devices  for  robustness  in  temperature  cycling  and  long  operation  times.  The  SPAD  device 
developed  still  suffer  from  a  level  of  afterpulsing  comparable  to  that  of  the  commercial  APD  devices  previously 
studied.  However, the new SPAD devices have reached a sufficiently high level of operating performance to allow 
them to be used as a basis for further analysis; a subsequent development program is planned for investigating the 
origin of the trap states that cause the afterpulsing phenomenon and methods for reducing their concentration.

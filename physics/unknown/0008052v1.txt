Abstract

For the CLIC two-beam scheme, a high-current, long-
pulse  drive  beam  is  required  for  RF  power  generation.
Taking advantage of the 3 GHz klystrons available at the
LEP  injector  once  LEP  stops,  a  180 MeV  electron
accelerator  is  being  constructed  for  a  nominal  beam
current of 3.5 A and 1.5 2s pulse length. The high current
requires  highly  effective  suppression  of  dipolar  wakes.
Two  concepts  are  investigated  for  the  accelerating
structure  design: 
the  “Tapered  Damped  Structure”
developed for the CLIC main beam, and the “Slotted Iris
– Constant Aperture” structure. Both use 4 SiC loads per
cell for effective higher-order mode damping. A full-size
prototype of the TDS structure has been built and tested
successfully at full power. A first prototype of the SICA
structure is being built.

1  INTRODUCTION

in  detail 

The power generation in the CLIC two-beam scheme,
described 
in  [1],  relies  on  drive  beam
accelerators  (DBAs)  operated  at  937 MHz  (30 GHz/32).
The  DBA  for  CTF 3  will  operate  at  3 GHz.  This  allows
re-use of S-band equipment from the LEP injector which
will be available once LEP stops.

To maximize RF generation efficiency, the drive beam
accelerator  will  be  operated  at  almost  100 %  beam
loading, i.e. over the length of each accelerating structure,
the accelerating gradient will decrease to almost zero.

The  CTF 3  drive  beam  accelerator  will  consist  of
approximately 20 accelerating structures, each of 32 cells
and a total length of 1.3 m. It will operate in 25/3 mode
and at a moderate accelerating gradient of 7 MV/m.

Two types of structure are being  studied:  the  Tapered
Damped Structure (TDS) has originally been designed for
the  CLIC  main  accelerator  and  was  scaled  down  in
frequency  by  a  factor  10.  This  study  is  well  advanced.
This  structure  has,  however,  the  disadvantage  of  its  size
(outer  diameter  430 mm).  Since  some  structures  at  the
upstream end will have to fit into focusing solenoids, we
are now also studying a slotted iris structure with an outer
diameter of only 174 mm as an alternative. This approach
is interesting also in view of the scaling to 937 MHz, and
has the additional feature of a large constant iris aperture
and  consequently  lower  short-range  transverse  wake

fields.  We  refer  to  the  latter  as  SICA  (Slotted  Iris  –
Constant Aperture).

2  GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Both  the  TDS  and  the  SICA  structure  are  based  on
classical  S-band  cells.  For  the  generic  geometry,  see
Fig.1.  Detuning  and  modulation  of  the  group  velocity
(from  5  to  2.5 %  over  the  length  of  the  structure)  are
implemented  by  iris  variation  in  the  TDS  (keeping  the
nose-cone  size  x  at  zero),  and  by  nose-cone  variation  in
the  SICA  structure  (keeping  a  constant  at  17 mm).  In
both cases, b is adjusted for the correct phase advance of
/3 at the operating frequency. The first cell has the same
dimensions in both designs (a = 17 mm, x = 0).

Figure 1: parameters of the cell geometry. The nose-cone
size x is zero for the TDS structure. Nose-cone sizes in
different SICA cells are shown dotted.

The main difference between the two approaches is the
coupling  of  the  higher-order  modes  (HOMs)  to  the  SiC
loads.  TDS  uses  wide  openings  in  the  outer  cell  wall,
coupled to 4 waveguides with an axial E-plane, and with
a cut-off above the operating frequency serving as high-
pass filter for the HOMs. SICA on the  other  hand  relies
on  geometrical  mode-separation  by  4  thin  radial  slots
through  the  iris,  coupling  dipole  modes  to  a  ridged
waveguide with its E-plane in the azimuthal direction. In

both cases, the SiC absorbers are wedge-shaped for good
matching.

Both  designs  allow  highly  effective  dipole  mode
damping.  Fig.  2  shows

with a 8 of 2.5 mm, assuming the damping waveguides to
be matched. These results were confirmed by frequency-
domain calculations with HFSS,  taking  the  properties  of
SiC into account: The first dipole mode of the TDS had a
Q of 18, that of the SICA structure had a Q of 5.

3  TDS

The  cells  are  supplemented  with  four  32 mm  wide
damping  waveguides  against  transverse  and  longitudinal
HOMs.  The  cell  wall  thickness  is  about  20 mm  and  the
extruded copper waveguides are brazed into openings in
the cell wall as shown in Fig. 3. The extruded waveguides
constitute  convenient  housings  at  their  outer  extremities
for the SiC absorbers that can be inserted through 16 mm
mini-flanges  after  the  final  brazing  of  the  structure.  The
absorbers  will  then  either  have  been  clamped  or  brazed

onto metal holders. By introducing the SiC wedges after
the final structure  brazing,  thermal  strains  on  SiC  bonds
can be avoided and exchangeability is obtained.

The  prototype  was  brazed  in  5  parts  in  a  vertical
position (2 couplers and the main body in 3 units). During
that  operation  the  damping  waveguides  with  prebrazed
end flanges were also bonded with the cells. Finally the 5
parts were brazed horizontally.

For future TDSs a single, uncomplicated vertical braze
is foreseen at eutectic temperature, joining cells, damping
waveguides and couplers. To avoid deformations (during
the brazing) of the lowermost cells, the cell wall thickness
will  be  increased  to  35 mm,  the  total  structure  weight
being ~160 kg.

Figure 4: Bead-pull measurement:  an  error  of  about  40 º
between the 1st and last cell is measured in this reflection
diagram, corresponding to a phase slip of  ±10 º  between
electron and wave over 32 cells. The loss in accelerating
efficiency  is  less  than  1 %.  The  cells  are  not  equipped
with dimple tuners.

3.1  Low-level measurements and power tests

Figs. 4  and 5 give measured low-level results for the
brazed 32-cell TDS. Fig. 4 shows a measurable deviation
from  the  ideal  240 º  phase  advance  per  cell  of  the
reflection  coefficient,  but  even  this  error  would  lead  to
acceptable  1 %  loss  of  accelerating  efficiency.  The
matching  of  the  input  and  output  couplers  over  a
bandwidth of 10 MHz is documented in Fig. 5.

Figure  5:  Reflection  measurement:  the  input  reflection
loss is below –30 dB in a usable bandwidth of 10 MHz.

After  brazing, 

the  TDS  was  submitted 

to  RF
conditioning  and  reached  the  nominal  power  of  40  MW
in  less  than  1  week,  and  subsequently  52  MW  (the
maximum power level available at CERN).

4 SICA

In  the  tapered  damped  structure,  the  waveguides
between the accelerating cells and the SiC loads serve as
high-pass filters, below cut-off for the accelerating mode,
but  transparent  for  higher-order  modes,  in  particular  the

diameter  is  174 mm.  The  round  holes  are  cooling  water
tubes; dimple tuning is provided (not shown).

first dipole mode (at approximately 4.1 GHz). In order for
this  filter  to  work  effectively,  substantial  waveguide
length  is  required.  This  lead  to  an  outer  diameter  of  the
3 GHz TDS of approximately 430 mm.

As  opposed  to  the  “filter”  type  mode  selection  of  the
TDS, the SICA structure uses “geometric” mode selection
[2]: a small radial slot in the iris does not intercept radial
nor  axial  surface  currents,  so  it  will  not  perturb  the
accelerating  TM01  mode  (nor  any  other  TM0n  mode).
Dipole  modes  however  have 
current
components which are intercepted and will thus induce a
voltage  across  the  slot.  If  this  slot  continues  radially,
cutting  the  outer  cell  wall,  it  can  be  considered  as  a
waveguide,  the  cut-off  of  which  can  be  made  small  by
using a ridged waveguide.

azimuthal 

Another concern was the short-range transverse wake,
the  strength  of  which  is  dominated  by  the  iris  aperture
alone and hardly affected by detuning or damping. So we
introduced nose-cones, varying in size from cell to cell to
obtain the same linear variation of the group velocity (5
to  2.5 %)  as  in  the  conventionally  detuned  structure,
keeping  the  iris  aperture  constant  at  Ø  34 mm.  The
overall  detuning  of  the  first  dipole  mode  is  slightly
smaller than for the TDS, but sufficient. All other HOMs,
longitudinal and transverse, show a larger detuning.

The ridged waveguides are machined into the cell, the
slots by wire etching, the waveguide by milling. The SiC
wedges  are  fixed  with  a  specially  designed  clamp,
avoiding  thermal  strains  during  brazing.  Water  cooling
channels  and  dimple  tuning  are  provided.  The  complete
structure is brazed vertically and in one pass.

The SICA structure leads to a very compact design and
its outer diameter of 174 mm allows the reuse of focusing
solenoids from the LEP preinjector which have a bore of
180 mm.

A  disadvantage  of  the  SICA  structure  is  an  increased
ratio of surface field to accelerating gradient, about 30 %
higher than for the TDS structure at the downstream end.
A further 20 % increase of the surface field will occur at
the  edges  of  the  slots.  Another  critical  issue  is  currently
under study: since geometric mode selection is relying on
symmetry, the demands on the symmetry of the structure
are high. A quantitative sensitivity analysis is under way.

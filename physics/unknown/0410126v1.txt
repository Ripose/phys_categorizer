Abstract
There is a classic alternative to the Franck-Hertz experiment designed to show

more than a recurrence of the first excited state. Instead of being subjected to a

rising  potential  between  source  and  accelerating  grid,  electrons  are  now

accelerated  in  less  than  one  excitation  mean-free-path  by  an  extra  grid,  and

then  drift  towards  the  second  grid  across  a  large  equipotential  region.  In  this

arrangement one must face the difficulty that the space potential between the

grids  is  strongly  modified  by  space  charges.  A  recent  analysis  of  this

experiment with mercury showed that there is a particular form of discharge that

generates and sustains the ideal design dynamically. The inevitable variations

of  potential  inside  the  intergrid  volume  are  then  confined  within  a  narrow

sheath, a free double layer, joining two field-free plasma regions. The position

of the double layer can be controlled so as to optimize the experiment. In the

present  paper,  those  phenomena  are  studied  theoretically  in  steady-state

conditions.  The  essence  of  the  method  is  to  specify  velocity  distributions  for

electrons  and  ions  and  use  them  to  solve  the  Poisson  equation. Vortex-type
functions  are  used  for  trapped  particles  and  mono-energetic  beams  for  free

particles.  The  model  explains  the  change  of  position  of  the  double  layer  and

provides  a  natural  explanation  of  a  threshold  condition  for  its  amplitude  that

governs the transition between two critical configurations, in accordance with

experiment. Stability and minimum field-energy considerations lead to a unique

solution  in  a  four-dimensional  parameter  space  where  the  Langmuir  ratio  is

equal  to  one.  The  method  is  adaptable  to  other  experiments  on  double  layer

formation  under  discharge  conditions  and  correctly  predicts  the  values  of

several plasma parameters.

1. Introduction

The main object of this paper is to model theoretically the formation of a steady

state electric double layer within the volume of bounded discharge plasma.

This project is part of a longtime effort [1-3] to elucidate a well-known

extension of the Franck-Hertz experiment with mercury, designed to show more

than  the  recurrence  of  the  lowest  excited  state.  In  that  version,  rather  than

being  subjected  to  a  rising  potential  between  source  and  accelerating  grid,

electrons are accelerated in less than one excitation free-path by an extra grid,

and  allowed  to  travel  towards  the  second  grid  across  a  supposedly  field-free

region.

A  large  amount  of  structure  in  the  current-voltage  curve  is  indeed

displayed, but it is very difficult to find a setting of the energy scale leading to a

consistent interpretation. The foremost problem is that the electrostatic potential

distribution  evoked  by  the  electrode  voltages  is  strongly  modified  inside  the

intergrid region by the interaction of negative and positive space charges.

A detailed analysis (see [2]) showed that a determination of the space

potential  can  be  deduced  from  a  careful  examination  of  the  change  in  the

spectra  induced  under  controlled  conditions.  It  was  found  that  if  a  constant
decelerating voltage (∆V) is applied across the main collision cell, the series of
peaks is identifiable as a superposition of two copies of e--Hg spectra excited at
two  different  potentials.  The  obvious  inference  is  that  the  scattering  cell  is

separated into two field-free, weakly ionized plasma regions, joined by a narrow

space-charge  double  layer  (see  figure  1).  Also  required  for  a  complete

interpretation is the presence of another space-charge structure, a rising wall-

sheath at the exit of the first grid, as shown by the dashed curve in figure 1.

Evidently,  besides  its  main  scope,  this  experiment  is  also  a  useful

workground  for  studying  the  formation  of  narrow  electrostatic  structures  in  a

bounded region of plasma containing neutral gas at moderate pressures. The

advantage of this particular experimental arrangement is that the link to specific

atomic physics phenomena stands out immediately.

Lacking as yet is a direct confirmation of the presence of a wall-sheath

and  a  ‘free’  double  layer  (DL)  during  operation;  nor  is  it  likely  that  a  non-

intrusive  measurement  of  the  space  potential  is  forthcoming  in  this  type  of

sealed apparatus. Suggestive as it may be, the testimony presented so far to

uphold the contention of DL formation is purely circumstantial.

But a more persuasive case would be made if one could put together a

physical model that could be subjected to mathematical analysis to show the

emergence  of  the  proposed  reconfiguration  of  the  space  potential  for

appropriate  values  of  the  plasma  parameters.  Above  all,  the  theory  should

answer  the  crucial  question: How is it possible for this potential structure to

persist throughout the experiment despite the ostensible alteration of the

various components of space charge as the energy of the primary beam is

raised?

Section  2  is  a  collection  of  the  experimental  facts  found  in  [2],

supplemented  by  some  additional  observations,  obtainable  electrically  and

visually, on the evolution of the discharge towards the stable form governed by

the space potential shown in figure 1. This sum-up clarifies the objectives of the

model. In the interest of simplicity the physical arguments (and the subsequent

theory) are presented in infinite parallel plane geometry. In the actual apparatus

only the first grid is planar. The other three electrodes are cylindrical.

The remaining sections are devoted to formulating the theory and using

it to model the observations of section 2.

2. Review and appraisal of observations

2.1 Inferences gathered from examination of excitation curves

The configuration shown in figure 1 sets in abruptly at a well-defined value, say
Vcrit,  of  the  accelerating  potential  Vg1.  Past  this  point,  the  excitation  curve
(namely  the  plot  of  the  current  between  g2  and  the  anode  A  against  the
accelerating potential Vg1) displays two copies of the e- -Hg spectrum. One of
them  corresponds  to  inelastic  events  incurred  at  potential  Vg1+δ  and  is
independent of the value of ∆V. The other copy corresponds to the same series
of inelastic events incurred at potential Vg1-∆V,  namely  the  voltage  of  grid  2.
Increasing ∆V  displaces  the  latter  series  of  peaks  rightwards  with  respect  to

former, and vice-versa. One can thus optimize the experiment by adjusting the
value of ∆V to hide the high-potential peaks.

A typical ‘pure’ excitation curve obtained in these conditions is shown in
figure 2. This curve was taken with ∆V=4.1.  The  peaks  labelled  by  numbers
2,3,4…  show  inelastic  events  incurred  in  the  low-potential  plasma  (their
energies are measured from D at Vg1=∆V). Peaks b,c,d correspond to events
2,3,4 incurred at Vg1 potential, and are always present since the low-potential
drift space has not been formed as yet. Peak 1 has no bearing on the present

considerations; it is due to a shape resonance in the elastic cross section at 0.4

eV as discussed at length in [3].

The discontinuity labelled A (visible here as a precipitous completion of

peak 2) is a signal that the space potential on the high potential side jumps from
the solid to the dashed line in figure 1. The position of feature A (namely Vcrit)
and  the  value  of  δ  are  affected  by  the  strength  of  cathode  current,  but  are
independent  of  the  value  of  ∆V.  At  optimal  cathode  current  (as  in  figure  2)
feature A occurs at ~9.5 V on the scale of Vg1 potential, and δ=2.6 volts. Hence
the  total  amplitude  ψ=∆V+δ  in  figure  2  is  6.7  volts.  At  larger  currents,  the
system goes into an oscillating regime at feature A (for details on this point see

section 8.2 of [2]).

At  values  of  ∆V  lower  than  4.1,  the  peaks  of  figure  2  are  shifted
leftwards  and  so  the  high-potential  features  are  gradually  unmasked  (see

figures 2, 3 and 4 of [2] where also feature A is more clearly displayed).

Below  ∆V=2.1  the  low-potential  peaks  disappear  and  the  curves
become  pure  high-potential  spectra  (though  peaks  2  and  3,  now  lying  well

below  feature  A,  may  remain  discernible).  This  leads  to  the  most  important
inference: a minimum intergrid voltage, ψ=∆V+δ=2.1+2.6=4.7, is necessary for
the sustained presence of a field-free low-potential region of significant width

throughout the range of accelerating potential. Moreover, the energy equivalent

of 4.7 V coincides with the lowest inelastic threshold of mercury.

Values  of  ∆ V  between  4.1  and  4.3  offer  the  best  display  of  the
spectrum.  For  ∆V > 4.3,  the  high-potential  copy  does  not  reemerge  but  the
peaks become significantly weaker.

2.2 The role of cathode emission current

The  formation  of  a  double  layer  well  away  from  grid  2  is  also  crucially

dependent on the strength of the current emitted by the oxide-coated cathode.

Too  low  a  cathode  current  prohibits  the  formation  of  low-potential  plasma:
regardless  of  the  amplitude  ψ of intergrid  potential  only  the  high-potential
spectrum is observable. Evidently the DL remains very close to the outer grid in

this case.

Strong as the injected beam needs to be, it seems that it must also be

sufficiently cold. Overheating a poorly activated cathode to raise the current will
not  do.  The requirement of a sufficiently strong and cold electron beam is a
second important condition for moving the double layer away from grid 2.

2.3 Positive-ion current

The  ion  current  can  be  monitored  separately  by  a  small  modification  in  the

anode  circuit.  Curves  recorded  with  that  arrangement  show  that,  with  a  well

activated cathode, a weak ion current sets forth already at feature b, likely due
to  cumulative  ionization  via  the  metastable  3P0 and  3P2 states.  At  Vg1=Vcrit
(feature A) this ion current rises suddenly by several orders of magnitude and

increases steadily but slowly thereafter.

2.4 Visual observations

It is possible to ascertain some highlights in the evolution of the discharge by

peering through the top of the tube while tracing curves of the type shown in
figure 2. As the voltage Vg1 is raised, the visible part of the region between the
electrodes appears at first dark. When Vg1 reaches the potential of peak b, two
localized blue-green glows are born, seemingly bordering the flat sides of the

electron gun, and stretching in opposite directions towards the second grid as

the voltage increases. In different samples of the tube the rates of elongation in
each direction may differ. When the outer edge of a glow reaches g2, the entire
half-volume on that side is lit up and the color changes to pinkish. This transition

occurs  precisely  at  the dip  preceding feature 2,  (feature  L  in  figure  2).

Thereafter the light becomes whiter and more brilliant.

The  ring  between  g2  and  the  anode  remains  dark.  The  persistent

absence of visible light in that zone indicates that most inelastic collisions occur
outside  the  g2- A  region  (this  is  fortunate  for  otherwise  the  superior  detection
mechanism responsible for displaying the low-potential spectrum, as modelled

in [3], would not be so simple).

On the scale of g2 potential, L is located at 4.7-4.8 V. It is manifest that
a  special  discharge  to  the  outer  grid  is  initiated  when  the  beam  energy  at  g2
exceeds  the  level  of  the  first  excited  state,  63P0,  (a  metastable  state).  As  a
result,  a  sufficient  extent  of  field-free  plasma  adjacent  to  g2  is  immediately
created with resulting emergence of peak 2 due to the next state (63P1).

2.5 A scenario of potential formation

With  the  aid  of  these  observations  we  can  attempt  to  construct  a  plausible

scenario leading to a steady space potential of the type shown in figure 1.

≅ 5-5.5) two - step ionization via the metastable 3P states
1) At features b,c (Vg1
(especially 3P2) produces an excess of positive space charge. This creates a
maximum of potential on either side of g1 wherein the primary electrons are able
to excite higher-lying states. For the green and blue lines of mercury to emerge
the 7 3S1 state at 7.73 eV must be excited. The peaks of the humps must then
be about 2.3 -2.8 V above the voltage Vg1. Ion production is maintained because
the  metastable  states  are  being  persistently  repopulated  by  the  radiative
transitions 7 3S1 →→→→    3P2 (green) and 7 3S1 →→→→    3P0 (violet). As the electrode voltages
Vg1 and Vg1-∆V increase the outer parts of the space potential are raised and
so the luminous regions stretch towards g2. Electrons drift across the tube in
opposite  directions  along  narrow  bunches  of  field  lines  emanating  from  the

planar exits of the electron gun.

This stage of the discharge is reminiscent of the physical picture based

on volume ionization modelled in Langmuir’s seminal paper, where the space

potential  turns  out  to  have  a  maximum  between  cathode  and  anode  in  a

parabolic configuration (see [4] pp 961-963). The temporary lack of uniformity of

the uphill potential is in line with the distortion of peaks a,b,c (as compared to

their analogs 2,3,4).

≅ 4.7+∆V the expanding glows reach g2. Somehow, the electron and
2) At Vg1
ion  populations  now  conspire  to  give  rise  to  a  region  of  field-free  plasma

adjacent  to  g2  (this  is  ‘somehow number 1’ ).  In  this  space  the  transport  of
charge carriers becomes essentially diffusive. Hence ions and electrons spread

out transversely to the field lines and so the glow fills the entire intergrid space.

3) The stage has now been set where a short further increase of Vg1 will lead to
the  configuration  along  the  dashed  line  of  figure  1.  Close  to  feature  A  the

energy  of  the  primary  beam  at  the  hump  of  space-potential  reaches  the

ionization threshold (10.4 eV), the ion current surges, and (again somehow) the
+δ (this is ‘somehow
hump expands into an equipotential plateau at potential Vg1
number 2’ ). The uphill region has now confined the previous smooth variations
of  electric  field  into  a  narrow  sheath  hugging  g1.  From  then  on  peaks
+δ  potential  (now  undistorted)  will  be
corresponding  to  excitations  at  Vg1
displayed. As mentioned, the maximal value of δ  is always close to 2.6 volts.

The strife among the various components of space charge to establish

overall stress balance leads to a pattern of two plasmas separated by a narrow

DL. The continued presence of wide enough low - potential plasma is critically
dependent on the magnitude of ∆V. Unless ψ exceeds the inelastic threshold of
mercury and the primary beam is sufficiently strong and cold, the high-potential

plasma will ultimately invade most of the intergrid region.

2.6 Goals of the theory

Our  object  is  to  construct  a  steady  state  model  applicable  to  the  final  stage.

Unlike  existing  theories,  this  one  should  be  capable  of  producing  unequal
widths of low and high-potential plasma and should thus reveal the mechanism

leading  to  the  two  extreme  configurations  where  one  or  the  other  of  the  two

plasmas invades most of the intergrid region.

Hopefully, the model will elucidate the basic requirements of a critical
amplitude  ψ  and  a  sufficiently  strong  and  cold  primary  electron  beam  and
provide valuable insight in regard to the somehows of subsection 2.5.

The fast transitions at L and A require a time dependent approach and

will not be treated in this paper.

3. Formulation of the model

Our approach is similar in spirit to the one-dimensional kinetic model for steady

stade  monotonic  double  layers  of  the  ‘strong’  variety  (namely  of  unlimited

amplitude) introduced by Schamel [5-6].

The  basic  ingredients  consist  of  four  species  of  particles:  free  and

trapped  electrons  and  ions.  Their  velocity  distributions  are  functions  of  the
particles’  total  energy.  The  free  (drifting)  particle  distributions  fef  and  fit  are
represented by delta functions and the trapped ones fet and fit are a generalized
sort of truncated Maxwellians:

fef = n0 [v0 /(v0 

2+2φ)1/2] δ[v-(v0 

2+2φ)1/2 ]                                        (1a)

fet = Aexp [(β/2)(v2-2φ)]                  v2 <  2φ                                   (1b)

f i f = νn0 [u0 /[u0 

2+2(ψ-φ)]1/2] δ{u+[u0 

2+2(ψ-φ)]1/2 }                          (1c)

f i t = νBexp {(α/2)[u2-2(ψ-φ)]}          u2 <  2(ψ-φ)                             (1d)

Electron  velocities  v,  v0   and  ion  velocities  u,  u0   are  normalized  by  (T/m)1/2,
(T/M)1/2,  respectively,  and  potentials  φ, ψ  by  T/e.  M  and  m  are  the  ion  and
electron masses, e is the electron charge, T is an arbitrary thermal energy, n0  is
the free-electron density at φ=0, and A, B, ν are positive constants.

The  parameters  α  and  β  can  be  of  either  sign.  Negative  values
correspond  to  common  (truncated)  Maxwellians.  Positive  values  generate
concave (vortex type) functions. The extension to positive α, β was introduced
by  Schamel  (see  [5-6])  in  order  to  model  the  formation  of  ‘electron  and  ion
holes’  and  of  so-called  ‘slow  particle  acoustic’  DL’s.  The  limits  α→ 0 ,  β→ 0 
correspond to rectangular (‘water-bag’) distributions.

The  assumption  that  an  unisotropic  component  with  a  single  narrow

peak is able to capture the essential physics might seem questionable, but will

be justified later on. Note that the direction of the beams can be changed by

inverting  the  sign  of  the  variables  v  and  u.  This  sign  is  immaterial  however,
because the subsequent results depend only on v2 and u2.

The  fact  that  our  distributions  are  functions  of  the  total  energy  (thus

satisfying the Vlasov equation) does not imply that our model is collisionless. It

simply means that the length d of the discharge is not significantly larger than
the mean free path λε for energy transfer to neutrals [λε=λ
M(M/2m)1/2 where λ
M
is  the  momentum-transfer  cross  section].  This  is  indeed  true  in  the  pressure

range  (3-4  Torr)  of  this  experiment  although  a  large  number  of  momentum-

changing collisions actually take place (see [3]).

In a first attempt [7] to model the phenomena of the extended Franck-
Hertz experiment the distributions (1b) and (1d) were used with negative α and
β. Later work revealed that strong DL solutions are also possible for α,β > 0 and
that above all the latter case is favored by experiment (see section 11).

n0 , are given (for positive α and β) by

potential  boundary (and no trapped ions at the high-potential boundary). The
constants a and b measure the proportion of trapped particles and ν is the ratio
of the high and low-potential densities.

Using  (10)-(12)  one  obtains  V(φ)  as  a  function  of  the  five  remaining
parameters ψ, α, β, X and Z. The results to be described below were obtained
by trial and error from various plots of this final form of V(φ).

4. Three important properties of the model

Consider first the symmetric case α=β, Z=X (and hence ν=1). Figure 3(a) shows
the function V(φ) obtained for ψ=3, α=0.5, X=1.1. This has the familiar inverted
bell-type form that is traditionally taken as proof of the desired configuration: a

sheath  of  rising  potential  joining  two  unbounded  quasi-neutral  and  field-free

regions,  ideal  plasmas.  Unbounded,  because  in  all  previous  models  the

diverges (logarithmically) at the end points φ=0 and φ=ψ: V(φ)~φ2 and ~(ψ-φ)2 as
φ ,  ψ-φ,  → 0 ,   since  imposition  of  ideal  plasma  conditions  at  the  boundaries
removes the zeroth and first powers.

The  first  important  point  in  the  present  model  is  that  Λ is finite:  an
uncancelled  half-power  remains  so  that  V(φ)~φ3/2  and  ~(ψ-φ)3/2  at  the  limits:
truncating  the  trapped  distributions  and  removing  the  high-energy  tails  of  the

free distributions produces natural cutoffs at the previously singular endpoints of

the integral in (13).

The second major point is that V(φ) may develop internal zeros: As X is
increased, the edges of the bell fold upwards as in figure 3(b). Eventually the
folds turn into local  maxima, and gradually rise toward the  φ axis, to become
‘quasi-zeros’ of V(φ) at points φ=ρ and φ=ψ-ρ as shown in figure 3(c). The quasi-
zeros are found to be quadratic, namely

-V(ρ)~(φ-ρ)2+ε,         -V(ψ-ρ) ~[ψ-ρ-φ]2+ε          0 <ε<<1                  (14)

As X is further increased the maxima creep into the region of positive
V(φ)  (ε<0)  and  the  solutions  become  oscillatory.  Such  solutions  are  not
discussed in the present paper.

The quasi-zeros give rise to narrow peaks in the integrand of (14) and

hence to extended quasi-field-free regions in x-space. In this way we obtain a

quantitative  description  of  plasma  and  double  layer  formation  in  a  bounded
region of Λ Debye lengths.

Also present are ‘pre-sheaths’ of amplitude ~ρ at the boundaries (see
figure 5(a) in section 6). Note that the Bohm condition for the sheath edge at
φ~ρ,  expressed  (as  shown  in  [8-9])  in  terms  of V(φ), by d2V/dφ2 <0  at  φ=ρ, is
equivalent to requiring the generation of quasi-zeros.

The  quantity  Λ(ψ)  increases  or  decreases  (logarithmically)  as  X  is
‘tuned’ or ‘de-tuned’ to lower or raise the value of ε. As long as ε remains small,
this stretches or contracts the plasma regions without affecting the pre-sheaths

and the double layer.

The third important property is that if ψ is varied, with αψ, βψ, X and Z
fixed,  V(φ)  remains  self-similar:  the  function  (1/σ)V[σφ, σψ; α/σ,  β/σ,  X,  Z]  is
independent of  σ.

Decreasing the product  αψ    requires a smaller value of X for obtaining
quasi-zeros and moves them closer together (and vice versa). Below a certain
value ( αψ ≅ 1.05), the quasi-zeros coalesce [-V(ρ)~(φ-ρ)4+ε] so that only a single
plasma region is left between large pre-sheaths of amplitude ψ/2. For large αψ 
the amplitude of the pre-sheaths can be very small so that we have essentially

two plasma regions at ‘wall’ potential.

The  formation  of  internal  quasi-zeros  of  V(φ)  is  not  particular  to  the
present  theory.  Langmuir’s  introduction  of  the  term  ‘plasma’  for  the  field-free

region following his ‘double-sheath’ ([4] pp. 976-980) was founded on exactly

this mechanism (in a simpler model with one-sided boundary conditions). Latter-

day authors have ignored this feature although it probably occurs in any model

constructed with trapped and drifting species. A typical example is the kinetic

model proposed by Swift [10]; it is easily verified that his Sagdeev potential too

can  acquire  one  internal  quasi-zero  (but  never  two)  for  certain  values  of  the

parameters.

Needless  to  say,  the  imposition  of  exact  charge  neutrality  at  the

boundaries is no longer physically necessary. Relaxing the boundary conditions
(8) and (9) to some extent does not significantly change the form of V(φ) and its
quasi-zeros,  but  would  require  more  parameters.  Thus,  setting  n(0)  and  n(ψ)
strictly equal to zero is merely a matter of mathematical convenience.

An interesting consequence of the finiteness of Λ for non-zero ε is that
equation  (13)  provides  a  determination  of  the  quantity  n0,  the  density  of  free
electrons at the low-potential boundary, in a plane-parallel discharge of length d
cm and amplitude ψ volts (T=1):

n0 =743 2 [Λ(ψ)/d]2 cm-3                                                (15)

5. Formation of two plasma regions of unequal length

For  unequal  values  of  α,  β,  separated  quasi-zeros  are  generated

regardless of the smallness of αψ, βψ.

For βψ< αψ, we find that

1)  The low and high-potential quasi-zeros (ρlow , ψ-ρhigh) satisfy ρlow>ψ-ρhigh.
2)  The higher quasi-zero produces a peak of smaller area in the integrand of
(13). Therefore, the low-potential field-free region is widest. In other words

the DL is closer to the high-potential boundary.

3)  ν>1.

For βψ >αψ  the converse statements are true.

6. A minimum energy principle

From the preceding discussion one is inclined to take the view that, in the types

of  discharge  considered  here,  only  the  solutions  containing  quasi-zeros  are

physically  relevant.  In  other  words,  around  a  region  of  parameter  space  that
produces  admissible  (bell-type)  forms  of  V(φ)  the  system  always  strives  to
adjust to the closest allowable configuration with two quasi-zeros.

To justify this pronouncement we need some physical principle, like a

minimum  of  some  energy.  The  obvious  quantity  is  the  total  electrostatic  field
energy F of the space charge configuration between φ=0 and φ=ψ. This is easily
evaluated in terms of V(φ)

Figure  4  shows  F  in  the  symmetric  case  of  section  4  (ψ=3, α=β=0.5,
X=Z), plotted for X between 1.03 and 6.675. We see that the field energy falls

sharply  at  both  ends  of  this  range.  Those  limits  of  minimal  energy  obviously

correspond  to  configurations  with  the  largest  extent  of  field-free  space  (and

hence proportionally the narrowest double layer).

The  minimum  of  the  left  branch  develops  at  X~1,  namely  when  the
2 >>ψ.  Fairly  field-free  regions  of  some
incident  drift  velocities  are  large,  v0 
extent are formed as X→ 1, Z→ 1, because the leading terms of V(φ) near the
boundaries have the form V(φ)~(1-X)φ3/2, ~(1-Z)(ψ-φ)3/2.

This  is  a  far  less  efficient  mechanism  for  generating  field-free  space

than the alternative way based on internal quasi-zeros (see figure 5). Moreover,

the  fast-beam  solutions  do  not  comply  with  actual  conditions  in  the  bulk  of  a

discharge:  the  primary  beam  is  dissipated  by  inelastic  impacts  with  resultant

creation of substantial populations of slow charge carriers.

consistent with our physical picture. The very interpretation of the spectrum in

Clearly,  it  is  the  lowest  field-energy  limit  (at  v0 

2 <<ψ ,   u0 

figure 2 rests on the premise that slow electrons are emitted isotropically from a
source at the entrance of the g2-anode region (see [3]).

It  is  conceivable  that  those  electrons  acquire  the  identity  of  a  narrow

beam, because a   s warm of electrons driven through mercury gas by a small

electric field, attains a velocity distribution with a narrow peak centered at nearly

zero  energy  [11].  This  is  a  consequence  of  a  large  peak  at  0.4  eV  in  the
momentum transfer cross section, due to a resonance in the e--Hg system [3].

 

Analogous  circumstances  should  hold  for  the  ions,  the  slowing

mechanism  now  being  charge-transfer.  The  cross  section  for  charge-transfer

collisions  of  mercury  ions  in  their  own  gas  is  similarly  peaked  at  very  low

energy.

Figure 6 shows how the distance Λ varies in the range of X of figure 4.
We see that the limits of minimal energy correspond to the largest values of Λ.
It follows from equation (16) that in discharges of this type filling a length d, the

states  of  minimal  energy  are  those  of  smallest  Debye  length  (most  efficient
screening) and hence of largest charge density n0 .

7. A stability argument

Examining the evolution of the density ratio ν [equation (13)] can further focus
the search for the most appropriate region in parameter space.

Plotting ν versus ψ for various values of the set {α, β, X, Z} brings out
some interesting features. Firstly, the form of ν(ψ) is essentially governed by the
parameters α, β, rather than X, Y. Secondly, for β < α, ν(ψ) contains a maximum
(a minimum for β> α); the rate of rise is much more rapid than the rate of fall and
the  peak  is  rather  blunt.  Reducing  β  shifts  the  position  of  the  maximum
rightwards while increasing α shifts it leftwards.

This  indicates  that  there  is  a  range  of  stability  and  suggests  that  we
should  seek  values  of  α, β  which  place  the  maximum  near  the  experimental
value of ψ. In that way, small changes of amplitude in either direction would not
require significant changes at the boundaries.

For moderately small βψ and moderately large  αψ the maximum of ν
remains conspicuous and the DL is closer to but still free of the high-potential

boundary. This is the range that we shall use below (section 8.1) in modelling
the case of wider low-potential plasma between B and g2 in figure 1.

In  the  extremely  asymmetric  situation  where  βψ <<1  and  α ψ >>1  the
rate of descent of ν(ψ) beyond the maximum becomes very weak : essentially,
the  function  ν(ψ)  rises  exponentially  to  a  constant.  In  this  domain  the  DL
reduces  to  a  ‘wall’  double-sheath  at  the  high-potential  boundary.  These

solutions are remarkably robust. Provided only that Z is larger than about 20,
the value of X required for producing the lower quasi-zero is unique: X≅ 9. Apart
from that these solutions are independent of α ,  β , ψ  and the density ratio tends

to ν≅ 2.8 (see the Appendix). Surprisingly, this value of ν is a universal upper
limit. This is an interesting result that can be tested experimentally. The largest
value of ν that I have found in the literature is 2.5 [12]; but then this was in the
free-DL domain where the theoretical values of ν are smaller than 2.8.

The stability of double layers is commonly discussed in the literature in

terms of the ‘Langmuir ratio’

It has been argued that the stablest double layers are those where L=1
(see [8-9] and references therein). Obviously in the present case L(ψ) develops
a minimum at the maximum of ν(ψ) (or a maximum for β > α).  It turns out that
the value of L(ψ) at the extremum is indeed close to 1 in moderately asymmetric
circumstances  (moderately  small  βψ  and  moderately  large  αψ)  and  changes
somewhat in more extreme cases.

The  outcrop  of  this  analysis  is  that,  given  values  ψ

constraints  that  (a)  the  extremum  of ν(ψ )  occurs  at  ψ
quasi zeros, determine the set {α , β, X, Z} uniquely.

8. Calculating the space potential of figure 1

8.1 The case of a larger proportion of low-potential plasma (β < α)

Step 1: The region between B and the second grid.

We take the high-potential boundary to be at the ‘edge’ B of the sheath formed

at the exit of grid 1. To be precise, B is a point left of which there are no trapped

electrons. The low-potential boundary is in a plane near grid 2 (see figure 1).
Note  that  although  the  imposition  of  equation  (8)  at  g2  is  still  a  matter  of
convenience,  charge  neutrality  and  vanishing  electric  field  must  both  be

enforced at B.

The  observations  outlined  in  section  2  suggest  that  we  look  for
solutions in the range 4.7< ψ < 6.7. These solutions should display widest low-
potential plasma, hence β < α. We also suppose that L=1. We begin by choosing

max  near  ψ=5,  and  by  trial,
a  value  of  ψ, say ψ=5,  seek  α  and  β  that  place ν
adjust X and Z to ensure that V(φ) has two good quasi-zeros (ε close to zero)
while L is kept close to 1. A good result is obtained with the following values for

the basic parameters

ψ=5   β=0.17   α=1.48   X=10.695   Z=21.338

for which the values of ν

max and of the Langmuir ratio L are

ν

max=1.961 (at ψ=4.995)     L =1.02

The quasi zeros, ρlow ,  ψ-ρhigh, are at 0.15 and 0.037 respectively.

In  view  of  the  property  of  self-similarity  of  section  4,  the  parameters
βψ=5× 0 .17 = 0.85, αψ=5×1.4 8 = 7.4, with the above values of X and Z, define a
unique solution characterized by the above values of ν
max and L. Larger values
of ψ imply proportionally smaller trapping parameters and larger incoming drift
velocities. Stability is maintained because the maximum of ν(ψ) is always at the
imposed  value  (say  ψ0) of ψ.  The  functions  ν(ψ)  corresponding  to  ψ0=5  and
ψ0=6.7 are shown in figure 7a.

Figure 7b shows the space potential obtained from this global solution
for ψ=6.7 (the experimental value used in recording figure 2). As required, the
low-potential region is considerably wider.

It is conceivable that the discharge is able to adjust the set  {α, β, v0 ,
u0 }  so  that  the  same  solution  is  applicable  to  an  entire  interval  of  ψ,  say
4 . 7 < ψ < 6.7. However, as ψ is raised to σψ, the distance Λ is changed to σ1/2Λ.
Thus if the total length of the discharge is constant, the system must also adjust
n0 to σ n0, with σ as large as 1.4. An alternative is to imagine that X and Y are
slightly de-tuned in the course of the adjustment process to increase the value
of  ε.  This  would  keep  Λ  unchanged  and  would  not  perceptively  change  the
position of the maximum of ν in relation to the chosen value of ψ.

The  preceding  treatment  can  easily  be  generalized  by  adding  a  fast
electron  beam  (say  of  initial  velocity  w0 >>v0 ,  such  that  Y=(1+2ψ/w0 
2)1/2  is
smaller than about 3), or a second slow beam whose velocity is comparable to
v0 .  On  doing  this  one  finds  that  the  results  are  virtually  unchanged:  a  single

slow beam fully represents the essential features.

Step 2: The region between the first grid and B

The requirement of no trapped electrons at the left of point B is implemented by
simply setting a=0 in equation (2a). Charge neutrality at φ=ψ [equation (9)] is
mandatory and so is equation (7). The former condition implies

ν=X-1                                                              (18)

Inserting (18) in (7) and solving for b we obtain

Using  (18),  (19)  with  a=0  in  (6)  we  find  our  new  V(φ)  in  terms  of  the  four
parameters ψ, α, X, Z.

Solutions  that  also  satisfy  equation  (8)  do  not  exist,  so  that  charge

neutrality at grid 1 is impossible. Moreover, without trapped electrons there can

never be a low-potential quasi-zero. Thus only a wall-sheath can be present at

the exit of the first grid in accordance with our hypothesis.

The amplitude ψ (δ in figure 1) is now fixed at 2.6 volts. Provided that
ions  are  emitted  isotropically  at  B,  the  value  of  Z  is  also  known,  since  the
2  of  the  ion  velocity  at  B  is  given  by  the  formula  for  Z  at  amplitude
square u0 
ψ=∆V+δ, used in the B-g2 solution.

To  determine  a  sensible  range  for  X  we  make  the  reasonable

assumption that in this portion of the discharge the electron current at grid 1 is
2/2 is simply the equivalent
essentially the cathode beam, so that the energy v0 
of  the  accelerating  potential  Vg1.  The  latter  varies  between  the  voltage  at
feature  A  (~10  volts)  and  about  25  volts.  This  implies  that  X  varies  between

1.12 and 1.05.

Inserting  the  values  of  X  and  Z  in  V(φ)  we  find  that  the  requirement
V(φ) < 0  imposes a lower bound α
min give rise to
a quasi-zero near φ=2.6 and are therefore in conflict with the stipulation that B is

min on α. Values of  α close to α

the edge of the wall sheath at g1. Thus we must assume that α is larger than
α
min.  Choosing  Vg1=15  volts,  namely  X=1.083,  and  using  Z=13.28  (the  value
corresponding to ∆V+δ= 6.7) we find α

min=1.4.

Figure  7c  shows  the  wall-sheath  obtained  with  α=3.  The  distance  Λ

(now in units of the Debye length of the g1-B region) is 5.4.

In fact these solutions are not sensitive to the value of Z. Because X

remains  close  to  1,  they  are  also  essentially  independent  of  the  accelerating
potential. Moreover, adding a low-energy beam [such that Y=(1+2ψ/w0
2)1/2 is
larger  than  about  6 ]  to  this  part  of  the  calculation  produces  insignificant

changes. This answers the crucial question italicized in the Introduction.

Step 3: The final test

The solutions of steps 1 and 2 match smoothly at B, since on each side they

culminate to a flat potential. Still, it makes no sense to claim that the primary
beam dominates in the g1-B region unless we know that B remains very close to
the first grid.

We  now  show  that  this  is  indeed  the  case.  Let  d1  be  the  distance
between g1  and  B,  d2  the  distance  between  B  and  g2, and d= d1+d2 the total
distance.  Equation  (15)  implies  that  the  ratio  (Λ/d)2 n0
-1  is  invariant.  This
provides  a  second  relation  between  d1  and  d2.  Hence  d1= d/(1+Rn1/2) where
R=Λ

1 and n=ν

1.

Applying  this  to  the  solutions  of  steps  1  and  2  we  find  that  d1/d=0.1.

This completes our solution.

8.2 The case of a larger proportion of high-potential plasma (β > α)

Obviously, the previous solution with β→ α   and X → Z gives rise to the opposite
configuration of largest high-potential potential plasma. The extremum of ν(ψ) is
now a minimum and the extremum of L(ψ) is a maximum. The only difference is
in step 3. Because ν
min=1/1.961=0.51, the ratio d1/d obtained in step 3 is twice
as  large  (0.2).  In  compensation  we  can  take  a  larger  value  of  α  in  step  2  to
reduce Λ

1.

8.3 The proportion of trapped particles

An interesting consequence of our particular choice L=1 for the Langmuir ratio

is found by calculating the proportions of trapped particles [the quantities ‘a’ and

‘b’ in equations (2a) and (2b)].

Consider  the  case  β < α  of  section  8.1.  The  proportion  of  trapped
electrons  is  determined  by  the  total  charge  density  at  φ=ψ  [equation  (10)].
Figure  8  shows  the  plot  of  a(ψ),  with  an  imposed  value  ψ
0=6.7  (so  that
β=0.85/6.7).  We  see  that  there  is  a  range  of ψ surrounding ψ
0  where  a(ψ) is
essentially constant [a(ψ)≅ 3]. For L ≠1 this plateau does not arise. Instead, the
function  a(ψ)  varies  up  and  down  in  this  region  so  that  varying  ψ  in  either
direction  affects  significantly  the  relative  proportions  of  trapped  and  drifting

electrons. In other words, the high-potential region is unstable with respect to
electron-current oscillations, unless L ≅ 1.  This  is  in  line  with  our  earlier
observations in regard to the critical behavior at feature A (see section 2.1) and
suggests that, at optimal conditions, the system is able to settle into the L ≅ 1
solution. The fraction of trapped ions [b(ψ) of equation (11)] does not exhibit this
kind of fluctuating behavior. In our L ≅ 1 solution, we find b≅ 2.

In the opposite configuration where β > α, the fluctuating quantity is b(ψ).
Hence  this  case  is  formally  unstable  with  respect  to  ion-current  oscillations.

Since ions are very inert, oscillations of this type are unlikely to be sustained. It

follows that the relaxation oscillations observed at feature A are associated with

the previous case involving the lighter charge-carriers (electrons) which have a

much faster time of response.

In a future time dependent treatment, this difference between electron

and ion dynamics will probably explain why the uphill potential rises by as much

as 2.6 volts, while the analogous phenomenon (a substantial depression in the

space  potential  below  the  voltage  of  grid  2)  does  not  take  place.  A  similar

imbalance occurs in the field of electron and ion ‘holes’ [5,6].

8.4 Physical interpretation of the threshold conditions

The  preceding  results  provide  a  reasonable  qualitative  explanation  for  the
threshold requirements in regard to ψ  and to the cathode current.

For ψ < 4.7, the combination of a shallow ion vortex and a deep electron
vortex  gives  rise  to  a  larger  proportion  of  high-potential  plasma.  A  significant

fraction of the primary electrons undergo ionizing collisions. These share their

energy with the outgoing electron and so there is a relative lack of very slow
electrons  (β >1).  Volume  ionization  combined  with  charge-transfer  collisions
provides  both  slow  and  fast  ions  (α <<1).  These  circumstances  change
dramatically  for  ψ > 4.7.  The  beam  of  slow  electrons  produced  on  the  low-
potential  side  can  now  acquire  sufficient  energy  uphill  to  effect  excitation

collisions. The resulting extra population of slower electrons generated by this
feedback  ‘fills’  the  electron  vortex  reducing  the  value  of  β.  This  tends  to
increase the width of low-potential plasma. It also deforms somewhat the high-

potential  drift  space  so  that  the  charge-exchange  collisions  conducive  to
creating  slow  ions  become  less  probable;  hence  α  increases.  In  the  end  we
reach the opposite stable state of larger low-potential plasma where β <<1, α >1.

The requirement of a sufficiently large cathode current follows from the
relationship  between  n0  and  Λ   in  the  g1-B  region.  Obviously  the  system  is
unable to adapt to this type of solution in the given length of intergrid distance
unless  n0  (essentially  the  density  of  the  primary  beam)  is  large  enough.  In
addition, if the beam is too hot, the slow-electron beam will also be wider and so

the subtle conspiracy between drifting and trapped populations responsible for

producing quasi-zeros can probably not take place (see section 10).

9. Some quantitative results

Various quantitative estimates are obtainable for testing the predictive power of

the model.

Consider  for  instance  the  value  of  n0 .  Using  d=0.8  cm  (the  integrid
distance in our experiment) and the result of section 8 for ψ=6.7 (namely Λ=32,
d2 =0.9 d)  in  equation  (15),  gives  n0 =1.1× 1 0 9   cm-3.  The  value  for  the  energy
v0 2 /2  corresponding  to  X  is  0.06  eV.  Assuming  that  electrons  are  emitted
isotropically  at  the  lower  boundary  we  can  obtain  a  rough  estimate  of  the
current flowing to g2 .

In terms of the electron energy V0  in eV and the density n0  in cm-3 the
current density j in Amp-cm-2  is  given  by  j=9.5× 10-12× n0 V0 1/2. Hence we find

j=2.5 mA-cm-2. Taking an effective surface of 0.1 cm2 (the area of the g1 plane)
gives a current of 0.25 mA. This is indeed the order of magnitude of the current
measured at g2  (the average anode current is two to three orders of magnitude
smaller, as explained in [3]).

The  primary  beam  current  can  also  be  estimated.  Using  Λ=5.4,
d1 =0.1 d, to find the density at g1 , and V0 =15 eV, yields a current of about 9 ma.
This too is in agreement with what is observed: The fraction of cathode current
picked up by g1  at room temperature is typically about 1-1.5 ma. Because the
gap between the cathode and g1  is very small (0.02 cm), it is reasonable that
the transmitted portion responsible for the discharge is 6 to 9 times larger.

Data  on  plasma  parameters  in  experimental  studies  on  DL  formation

under discharge conditions are scarce. One case that can be used to check the

theory  is  the  experiment  of  Leung  et al  [13].  These  authors  used  a  multiple

plasma device. The DL was observed in the central ‘target chamber’ between
two  grids.  The  gas  was  argon  and  the  amplitude  ψ  was  about  14  V.  This  is
higher  than  the  inelastic  threshold  (11.6  eV)  and  is  consistent  with  our
prerequisite for the case ν>1. The low and high-potential plasmas were of about
equal length and the values found for ν run between 1.2 and 1.5. The density n0 
was mentioned to be ‘about’ 5× 1 0 7  cm-3.

Repeating the procedure of section 8.1 with the constraints that (a): the
0) ≅ 1.3, (c): two

0, of ψ, (b): ν(ψ

maximum of ν(ψ) is at the imposed value, say ψ
quasi-zeros are formed, we find the set of parameters

βψ=2.00   αψ=4.28   X=13.241   Z=16.662   ν

max =1.34   L=0.94

The positions of the quasi-zeros of this solution are more or less symmetric so
that the two plasma regions are indeed of similar length (for ψ=14, ρlow and ρhigh
are at 0.27 and 0.17 respectively).

Choosing ψ=14, we find Λ(ψ)=50. Assuming that d=10 cm (the distance
of travel of the electron gun measuring the space potential in [13]), we find that
n0 =3.5 × 1 0 7  cm-3. Clearly the agreement with experiment is remarkably good.

One  could  argue  that  bringing  the  maxima  of  V(φ) at the quasi-zeros
closer to the φ axis [namely reducing the value of ε  in (14)], could wildly modify

these results. But there is no cause for worry. The values of ε found in all our
previous solutions are about 1 0 - 6 . To reduce this ten-thousand-fold one must
fine-tune the parameters X, Z, to 6 or 7 significant figures. Even so, the value of
Λ  increases  by  less  than  a  factor  of  two  and  n0   by  less  than  four.  Thus  the
estimate of the density n0  obtained for ‘typically small ε’ is a meaningful result
proper to the theory.

Having said that, it is undeniable that the arbitrariness in regard to ε is a
weakness of the theory, and should be dealt with in a more elaborate treatment.

For example, one could include in equation (5) additional stress-terms arising

from energy transfer by elastic collisions and from thermal effects (a first step in

this direction was taken in [7]). This might perhaps answer the question: what
physical effect prevents ε from becoming negative?

10. Individual species’ densities and quasi-zero formation

The  mechanism  of  formation  of  quasi-zeros  can  be  further  understood  by  a

closer examination of the total charge density of each species.

Figure 9 shows the total electron density ne(φ) at low φ, corresponding
to the solution of section 8.1 with ψ=6.7. We see that the characteristic variation
leading to the lower quasi-zero (at φ≅ 0.2) is due entirely to the electron density.
The ions in this region merely provide a constant neutralizing background C to

raise the total density towards the zero axis. C is close to 1 and is mainly made

up of trapped ions (a 9 to 1 ratio of trapped and free ions).

This explains ‘somehow number 1’ of section 2.5. When the energy of
primary electrons at g2 reaches the inelastic threshold (at feature L of figure 2),
the  action  of  the  grid  creates  an  electron  vortex.  Most  electrons  are  trapped
within the separatrix (v2=2φ) but some are just able to escape (small v0). The
combination of these electron populations gives rise to a sharp gap in the total

electron distribution between the separatrix and the peak of the free electron
2+2φ)1/2 .  This  gives  rise  to  the  particular  variation  of
component  at  v=(v0 
negative charge density shown in figure 9. A population of trapped ions (locally

of uniform density) is also created by cumulative ionization. Provided that the

gap  is  not  too  wide,  the  ions  are  able  to  neutralize  the  interval  of  smallest

negative charge (the peak in figure 9). Macroscopically, a quasi-neutral, field-

free  scattering  cell  is  generated  where  the  beam  can  subsequently  excite

higher-lying states.

The same scenario with ions and electrons interchanged takes place at

feature A and explains ‘somehow number 2’.

11. The alternative model with negative αααα and ββββ

We end our analysis with a comparison to the model with convex distributions

(truncated  true  Maxwellians).  To  avoid  a  sea  of  minus  signs  we  change  the

signs of the exponents in 1(b) and 1(d) before integrating over velocities so that
again α and β are positive. The function V(φ) is now given by

As before one eliminates a, b and ν to get V(φ) in terms of the set  {α, β, X, Z}.

The  basic  difference  is  that  the  beams,  rather  than  the  trapped

particles,  are  now  the  dominant  factor  (the  coefficients  a  and  b  which  were

previously of O(1) are extremely small here). An interesting consequence is that

the values of X and Z leading to quasi-zeros can be found from power series
expansions  of  V(φ)  at  the  boundaries:  Consider  for  simplicity  the  symmetric
case α=β, X=Y. Near φ=0, to first order in the trapped and second order in the
φ 3/2 ) φ 3/2.  Given the values of ψ
beam contribution, one gets: V(φ)=(a1+a2 
and α,  the  condition  that  the  polynomial  factor  (a  cubic  in   φ 1/2 )  must  have  a
double zero gives an excellent estimate of the required value of X. The Bohm
condition is now equivalent to the requirement a2 > 0.

φ1/2 + a3

A solution with two non-symmetric quasi-zeros is obtained with the set
{βψ=6,  αψ=3,  X=2.171,  Z=2.975}  and  hence  ν=1.07,  L=0.74.  For ψ=6.7, the
quasi zeros are at ρlow=0.05, ψ-ρhigh=0.12.

Figure 10 shows the resulting space potential. Comparing to figure 7b,

we  see  that  now,  unlike  rules  1  and  2  of  section  5,  the  highest  quasi-zero  is

farthest from the boundary but gives rise to a narrower high-potential plasma.
Also, Λ=320, one order of magnitude larger than before.

At first sight it seems that this solution too fulfills our basic objectives.

Nevertheless it is incompatible with the present experimental circumstances, for

several reasons:

First, the presence of the slow-electron beam responsible for displaying

the inelastic spectrum is precluded by the smallness of X. Second, the value of
n0  (two orders of magnitude larger) is no longer in agreement with experiment.
Third, ν always turns out to be very close to 1, also in conflict with observations.
Fourth,  it  is  easily  verified  that  the  physically  appealing  ‘stability’  condition
based  on  the  peak  of  ν(ψ)  is  lacking.  Fifth,  the  conspiracy  leading  to  quasi-
zeros  consists  of  rather  miraculous  fine-tuning  between  all  four  species  of

particles.

The difference between positive and negative trapping parameters can
be further appreciated by considering an effective “temperature” Tt r of trapped
particles, obtained by averaging the energy v2/2  over the distributions 1(b) and
1(d) and dividing by the density. For electrons, setting τ = βφ, we obtain

                                                   (23)

For 0 < τ < ∞,  Tt r varies between (2/3)φ and 2φ in (22) and between (2/3)φ and
zero in (23).

Charged  particle  temperature  measurements  in  gas  discharges  are

subject to the notorious ‘Langmuir paradox’ most recently discussed by Tsendin

[18].  Nevertheless,  electron  temperatures  quoted  in  the  literature  are  usually

near the threshold energy of inelastic processes. This is clearly in agreement

with the range corresponding to the former case: in the solution of section 8.1,
the  values  of  Tt r  at  φ = ψ  corresponding  to  τ = 0.85  is  0.83 ψ.  In  contrast,  the
above solution of the convex case (where τ = 6 )  gives Tt r = 0.16 ψ.

12. Concluding remarks

I believe that the present model provides satisfactory theoretical support for the

remarkable contrivance of space charge phenomena responsible for creating

and maintaining the desired experimental design. Renewed experimental efforts

along this line by interested readers would obviously be welcome.

In a more general context, the theory could also shed new light on the

transitions from ‘anode glow’ to ‘ball of fire’ to ‘Langmuir’ mode in gas diodes, as

defined and discussed extensively in [14-17].

An outstanding unsolved problem concerns the formation of the rising
sheath adjacent to grid 1. Why does its equilibrium amplitude (δ) always settle
to the value of 2.6-2.7 volts? Is this number related to the kind of neutral gas?

These  questions  require  the  construction  of  a  time-dependent  model

describing the explosive phenomena taking place at features L  and  A, which

lead either to the equilibrium solution of section 8 or to current oscillations. A

promising line of approach is contained in a paper by Krapchev and Ram [19].

Using a large-amplitude time-varying field modulated in space, these authors

obtain  a  non-linear  mode  governed  by  a  smooth  electron  distribution  very

similar to the jagged form employed here. An intriguing consequence is that a
minimal  amplitude  of  the  potential  is  necessary  (φ > 2.7/ T,  where  T  is  the
electron thermal energy).

I am greatly indebted to Hans Schamel whose contribution in the early stages of

this  project  is  largely  responsible  for  the  development  of  the  present  model.

Martine  provided  badly  needed  encouragement  and  made  sure  of  the

completion of this work by creating unparalleled every-day conditions. I thank

Evelyne  Petermans  who  graciously  lent  me  her  computer,  when  mine  broke

down, so I wouldn’t stop calculating quasi-zeros.

If we take a particular DL solution in this extreme range, say with βψ=6× 1 0 - 6 ,
αψ=60, ψ=6, and seek X and Z to generate both quasi-zeros, we find that

X=8.964, Z=146, ρlow=0.25, ψ-ρhigh =0.00087.

Increasing αψ raises Z but X remains very close to 9. Whence the desired limit
of  ν(ψ)  can  be  found  from  (A1)  and  (A2)  as  γ→  ∞,  Z→  ∞  and  X→ 9.  The
function θ(γ) tends to 1 as γ→  ∞. Thus ν→  253/90≅ 2.81.

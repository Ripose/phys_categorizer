Abstract
—Some aspects of lasing at vibronic transitions in impurity crystals are theoretically studied. The
threshold conditions for a vibronic laser are shown to be dependent on the strength of interaction of optical cen-
ters with a local vibration, which forms the vibronic spectrum, and the crystal lattice temperature. The theory
can be easily generalized to the spectrum containing a structureless phonon sideband and well agrees with the

1.  INTRODUCTION

developed in this paper is applied to the description of
lasing in a chromium-doped forsterite single crystal.

The development of tunable solid-state lasers is one
of the most urgent scientiﬁc and practical problems of
laser physics, which has been actively elaborated in the
last years.

The  lasing  conditions  in  solids  are  signiﬁcantly
complicated  because  of  a  strong  adiabatic  vibronic
interaction, which determines the structure of vibronic
levels, the main lasing parameters being dependent on
the temperature of the laser medium and the strength of
vibronic  interaction  (see,  for  example,  [1-4]).  In  this
case,  a  phenomenological  description  of  lasing  based
on  the  use  of  the  rate  equations  for  level  populations
and  polarization  of  the  resonance  medium,  when  the
effect  of  the  lattice  and  intramolecular  vibrations  is
reduced only to the broadening of energy levels, cannot
be  considered  adequate. A  more  fundamental,  micro-
scopic  description  of  the  laser  action  in  vibronic  sys-
tems,  which  explicitly  takes  the  electron–vibrational
interaction into account, will not only elucidate the fun-
damental problems of lasing at vibronic transitions in
impurity crystals but also will be helpful in the search
for new, more efﬁcient laser materials.

The  vibronic  structure  of  optical  spectra  has  been
explicitly considered in the theoretical studies [5, 6] of
threshold conditions and the radiation ﬁeld dynamics of
a  vibronic  laser  performed  within  the  framework  of
semiclassical equations of motion for ﬁeld amplitudes
and  generalized  operators  of  the  transition  between
vibronic levels.

Below,  the  following  aspects  of  the  theory  of  a
vibronic laser are discussed: The microscopic approach
to the derivation of laser equations is realized, the linear
Fokker–Planck equation is obtained for the distribution
function of the laser ﬁeld amplitudes, the threshold las-
ing  conditions  are  discussed  [7,  8],  and  the  theory

2. THE  LINEAR  FOKKER–PLANCK  EQUATION 
FOR  THE  DISTRIBUTION  FUNCTION 
OF  LASER  FIELD AMPLITUDES

We assume that impurities in a crystal, which exhibit
lasing, can be treated as two-level quantum objects, whose
ground and excited states are adiabatically coupled with
phonon modes of the crystal lattice and local (for example,
intramolecular) vibrations, whose frequencies exceed the
maximum  frequency  of  lattice  phonons.  The  density
 of an ensemble of impurities interacting with
matrix 
vibrational  modes  and  the  electromagnetic  ﬁeld  in  a
cavity is described by the master equation

The model of an ensemble of resonance optical cen-
ters interacting with the radiation ﬁeld in a crystal con-
sidered here is quite general. In particular, a practically
important and often encountered case of the impurity
systems  whose  optical  spectrum  consists  only  of  one
zero-phonon line and a structureless phonon sideband,
which can produce lasing, is a simpliﬁed version of this
model.

To  derive  the  master  equation  describing  the  laser
action, one should adiabatically exclude the variables
related  to  the  polarization  ((cid:181)
),  inverse  population
((cid:181)

), amplitudes of local vibrations (b, b+), and lat-

vary  in  time,  whereas  the  amplitudes  a  and  a+  of  the
light  ﬁeld  slowly  vary  in  time.  Using  the  methods  of
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics [11, 12] and tak-
ing  into  account  that  the  orders  of  magnitude  of  the
operators  for  a  high-Q  cavity  satisfy  the  inequalities

isﬁed,  so  that  one  of  the  vibrational  replicas  of  the

the vibronic transition from the sth vibrational level in

annihilated) to the rth vibrational level of the ground elec-
tronic state (when r vibrational quanta are created). The
lasing threshold for such an individual vibronic transition

Expression (19) can be used for determining the las-
ing  thresholds  for  any  of  the  vibronic  transitions,
neglecting  their  interrelation  [in  the  general  case,
expressions  (13)  and  (15)  should  be  used].  If  sufﬁ-
ciently  high  gains  are  simultaneously  achieved  for  a
whole series of vibronic transitions, so that the corre-
sponding threshold conditions are realized, then, due to
a distribution of the ﬁeld modes in the cavity (because
the emission line has a ﬁnite width), the resonance can
be  achieved  at  several  transitions  rather  than  at  one
transition, and tunable lasing became possible.

expression (19) that as the strength of interaction (i.e.,
the  Stokes  loss  x 2)  of  the  optical  centers  with  an
intramolecular vibrations increases, the maximum gain
is achieved for the longer-wavelength vibronic transi-
tions.

4.  LASING  IN  THE  REGION
OF THE STRUCTURELESS PHONON SIDEBAND

If the optical spectrum of a crystal consists of only
a  zero-phonon  line  and  a  structureless  phonon  side-
band, i.e., the coupling of electronic states with high-
frequency local vibrations is negligible (or the latter are
absent at all), then we should set x  = n
 = 0 in the
above expressions and, in particular, in expression (15)
for the gain. For the estimates that will be performed
below, it is convenient to replace the phonon spectrum
of the crystal by an effective frequency w
0 (the Einstein
approximation). Moreover, if lasing takes place within
a narrow region of the phonon sideband, the condition
of the exact resonance

 = a

can  be  reasonably  imposed.  Then,  the  corresponding
gain, taking into account expression (15), can be rewrit-
ten in the form

The  arguments  of  the  function  G  (21)  show  that  the
gain  depends  on  the  electron–phonon  coupling  con-
stant l
0 and the temperature T of the crystal lattice, as
well as that an elementary event of emission of a quan-
tum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld of frequency w
 during
lasing  is  accompanied  by  the  creation  of  p  phonons
with frequency w
0 due to the resonance condition (20).
The linear Fokker–Planck equation (12) is sufﬁcient
for  the  determination  of  the  lasing  threshold  and  the
diffusion  constant,  whereas  the  real  amplitude  of  the
laser-ﬁeld oscillations can be found only with the help
of the nonlinear theory, i.e., taking into account in the
derivation of the master equation for the density matrix
the terms at least up to the fourth order inclusive in the
interaction Laf (or Haf). However, if the resonance con-
dition (20) is satisﬁed, the ﬁeld amplitude can be found
by modifying equations (14)–(16) from paper [14] by
 gf 1/2(l
making the substitution gexp[–S(T)/2] 
0; T).
As  a  result,  the  polarization  P,  the  inversion  D

5. APPLICATION  OF  THE  THEORY
TO  THE  DESCRIPTION  OF  LASING
IN A  Mg2SiO4  :  Cr4+  SINGLE  CRYSTAL

The theory of a vibronic laser developed above can
be  compared  with  experiments  on  lasing  observed  in
the  phonon  sideband  in  the  optical  spectrum  of  a
Mg2SiO4 : Cr 4+ forsterite single crystal. This laser pro-
duces  stable  quasi-continuous  emission  in  the  near  IR
region with an average output power of above 1 W [3, 4].
The  pump  frequency,  the  purely  electronic  transition
frequency, and the lasing frequency were 9276, 9158,
and 8097 cm–1, respectively. Because no decrease in the
quantum  yield  of  luminescence  was  observed  in  the
temperature range between 300 and 400 K of interest
for  applications,  i.e.,  the  nonradiative  relaxation  was
absent, this means that the vibrational potential curves
of the atoms in the conﬁguration space in the ground
and  metastable  electronic  states  should  not  intersect
(which was noted in [4]).

In  [4],  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  energy
efﬁciency h
 (the ratio I/Ip between the output and pump
powers)  of  a  Mg2SiO4  :  Cr 4+  laser  was  measured.
Expression (27) can be transformed to describe the exper-
imental  situation.  Indeed,  let  the  excess  over  the  lasing

Expression  (28)  takes  into  account  that,  at  sufﬁciently
high  temperatures,  for  example,  room  temperature,  the
rate g

ing contribution G (T) into (16), so that in fact we have

[see expressions (4) and (16)]. The function f(l

is deﬁned in (22). Thus, given the reference points T0,
0, we can express the energy efficiency of laser
(28)  only  in  terms  of  the  crystal-lattice  parameters,
such as the effective frequency w
0, temperature T, and
the  electron–phonon  coupling  strength  l
0.  However,
note that the effective frequency w

case different from this quantity appearing as an argu-
ment of the function f in (28).

The excess over the lasing threshold at T0 = 300 K
in the experiment [4] was D
0
was 10%. The temperature was measured with an exter-
nal heater. The experimental results are presented in the
insert  in  the  ﬁgure.  One  can  see  that  the  energy  efﬁ-
ciency of the laser decreases by 25% at T < 330 K and
lasing disappears at 380 K.

In the calculation of h (T) from expression (28), we
will assume that w
0 is equal to the difference between
the  purely  electronic  transition  frequency  9158  cm–1

and the lasing frequency 8097 cm–1, i.e., to 1061 cm–1,
and, because in this case only one-quantum transitions
occur,  we  will  set  p  =  1  in  expression  (22)  for  f  and
 = 1. The result of calculations is presented in the
ﬁgure. The theory adequately describes the temperature
dependence  h (T),  both  qualitatively  and  quantitatively,
despite  the  fact  that  the  phonon  spectrum  of  the  crystal
was represented by a very simpliﬁed one-oscillator model.

6.  CONCLUSIONS

In  this  paper,  some  aspects  of  the  operation  of  a
vibronic laser below the threshold have been studied. It
has been shown that the threshold conditions of lasing at
vibronic transitions depend on the strength of the interac-
tion  of  optical  centers  with  a  local  (intramolecular)
vibration that forms the vibronic spectrum—a series of
vibrational replicas of the purely electronic line. These
threshold conditions also depend on the crystal lattice
temperature.  As  the  Stokes  loss  per  local  vibration
increases, the maximum value of the gain is achieved at
the  longer-wavelength  vibronic  transitions,  while  the
increase in the crystal temperature reduces the gain at all
the vibronic transitions virtually in the same degree. The
theory can be readily generalized to the spectrum contain-
ing a structureless phonon sideband and well agrees with
the experimental temperature dependence of the output of
power of a Mg2SiO4 : Cr4+ forsterite laser.

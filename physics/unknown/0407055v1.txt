Abstract 

An  experimental  procedure  for  measuring  γΤ  has  been  developed  and  tested  in  two 

different  measurements,  with  the  γΤ  quads  on  and  off.    The  results  were  compared  to 

MAD  calculations.    The  discrepancy  between  the  measured  γΤ  and  the  calculated  γΤ  is 

less than 5%.  

Introduction 

There are twelve pulsed γΤ quads for faster transition crossing in the Booster, which were 

designed to change γΤ  one unit within 100 µs and, according to MAD calculation, they 

modify the tune less than 0.3 %.[1]  It is important to find an experimental procedure to 

measure the amount of γΤ changed by the γΤ quads when they are fired.  The γΤ is well 

known from the optical design to be 5.447 when the γΤ quads are off, and it has been used 

for  checking  the  precision  of  the  γΤ  measurement.    The  discrepancy  between  the 

measured γΤ and the design parameter is about 2.5%.  Also, the discrepancy between the 

measured γΤ change when the γΤ quads are pulsed and the calculation using MAD for the 

same condition is about 15%. 

Method 

The direct experimental data for the γΤ measurement are the closed orbit from the beam 

position monitors (BPM) and the rf frequency of the accelerating field from the universal 

time interval counter.  Eq. 1 is used for calculating γΤ[2] 

                                                                                                         (1)

where frf is the measured frequency using the HP5370 B universal time interval counter in 

the control room, C is the circumference of the Booster ring, and p is the momentum of a 

proton.  γ is the Lorentz’s relativistic factor; γT is γ at which transition occurs.  ∆frf, ∆C, 

and ∆p are the changes of the rf frequency, circumference, and proton momentum caused 

by the change of the radial orbit offset (ROF).  The rf frequency (frf) and γ for a Booster 

cycle are calculated from the magnet ramp, and are shown in Fig. 1.  According to Fig. 1, 

the  γ  of  a  proton  at  time  t  can  be  found  from  the  rf  frequency  measured  at  t.    ∆C  is

of BPM’s.  ∆C2 is the circumference change coming from the transverse displacement of 
the  beam  and  the  si,i+1  are  the  longitudinal  separations  (LS)  between  the  ith  and  (i+1)th 
BPM’s.  S48,1 is the LS between the last (48th) BPM and first (1st) BPM around the ring.  k 

is a scaling factor, which is used to correct the change of LS between two BPM due to the 

average radius change:

Results 
All the measurements were done at the extracted beam intensity of 0.315×1012 protons.  

A programmed radial offset (ROF) was used to move the beam during the time when the 

rf frequency and the closed orbit were simultaneously measured.  The measurement was 

repeated at eight different ROF values, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for the purpose of extracting 

the  slopes  of  the  rf  frequency  and  the  change  of  the  circumference  with  ROF  more 

precisely.   

The  first  measurement  was  taken  at  18.12  ms  in  the  Booster  cycle  when  the  γΤ 

quads  were  off.    Here,  the  beam  was  injected  at  2.0  ms.    The  rf  frequency  vs.  ROF  is 

shown in Fig. 2(a), and a slope of -0.0002 is obtained from the linear curve fit.  All the rf 

frequencies were measured by taking a 40-point average in order to minimize the error 

from  the  cycle-to-cycle  fluctuation.    The  closed  orbits  are  shown  in  Fig.  2(b).    The 

change  of  the  circumference  vs.  ROF  is  shown  in  Fig.  2(c),  and  a  slope  of  -8.1476  is 

obtained  from  the  linear  fit.    Eq.  3  is  used  to  find  γΤ=5.5858;  the  discrepancy  with  the 

design parameter γΤ=5.447 is about 2.55%.   

The  γΤ  measurement  was  repeated  at  19.02  ms  in  a  Booster  cycle  when  the  γΤ 

quads  were  fired  at  18.92  ms  and  reached  their  peak  current  of  760  A  at  the  2  kV 

setting.[3]    The  rf  frequency  vs.  ROF  is  shown  in  Fig.  3(a),  and  a  slope  of  0.00005  is 

obtained from the linear fit.  The closed orbits are shown in Fig. 3(b).  The change of the 

circumference vs. ROF is shown in Fig. 3(c), and a slope of -10.98 is obtained from the 

linear fit.  Eq. 3 is used to find γΤ=5.2676; the γΤ  calculated using MAD is 5.2346.  The 

discrepancy between the measured γΤ and the calculated γΤ is about 0.63 %. 

Conclusion 

The  direct  measurement  of  γΤ  was  made  with  the  γΤ  quads  on  and  off,  and  the  results 

were compared with the calculation using MAD with the γΤ quads on and with the design

value for the γΤ quads off.  Here, the γΤ design value is nearly identical to that calculated 

by  MAD.    Since  the  discrepancy  between  the  measured  γΤ  and  the  calculated  γΤ  using 

MAD  is  less  than  5%  for  either  γΤ  quads  on  or  off,  it  is  satisfactory  to  adjust  the 

operational parameters for the γΤ quads at the high intensity using MAD calculations.

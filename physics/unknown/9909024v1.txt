ABSTRACT

Here to represent the propagation of waves I attempted to describe them

separately in space and time domains. The time and space wave equations are

obtained and investigated, and formulas for the wave propagation are

expressed. I also tried to apply the model to the description of such physical

phenomena as the constancy of the speed of light and propagation of ocean

waves – tsunami.

Keywords: Wave Equation; the Speed of Light; Tsunami

Model Assumptions

For generality, I will consider here ‘the energy’s waves’. It gives me the

possibility to abstract from some insignificant details (from the model’s point of

view).

For simplicity, I will describe the one-dimensional space. One can look at

the coordinate as a vector to get a picture in multi-dimensional space.

I denote 

)txU ,
(

 to be the value of energy in point  x  at time  t . I also

denote 

)tx,Φ
(

 to be the level of energy in point  x  at time  t  (coincides with

)txU ,
(

 when the system is at rest).

energy’s disturbance 

)txU ,
(
∆

, i.e.

Difference between the value 

 and the level 

 constitutes the

When system is at rest, we can say

∆

(
txU

) 0
, ≡

                                                                                               (2)

or equivalently

(

txU

)

Φ≡

)tx
(
,

.                                                                                         (3)

I don’t mean in (3) that system has to be static to reside at rest. We will

consider a moving system in the eighth section of paper.

In contrast to the conventional wave equations, which are described by

partial differential equations of second order (see [3, 4, 6, 7]), I will be using the

3

following assumptions in the attempt to describe the dynamics of energy’s

disturbance separately in time and in space.

In the time domain,

(1) 

The second derivative of energy’s value with respect to time is inversely

proportional to energy’s disturbance.

(2) 

The first derivative of energy’s level with respect to time is directly

proportional to energy’s disturbance.

In the space domain,

(3) 

The second derivative of energy’s value with respect to direction is

inversely proportional to energy’s disturbance.

(4) 

The first derivative of energy’s level with respect to direction is directly

proportional to energy’s disturbance.

To simplify the reasoning I also introduce the dual variables 

)txP ,
(

, which

I will describe in the next two sections.

Energy Invariant

We can see that oscillations involve transformations of energy’s value into

energy’s ‘velocity’ in the time domain and energy’s ‘tangent’ in the space domain.

Therefore we can deduce the following energy’s ‘invariant’.

In the time domain,

(
ε
tx
,
1

)

=

(
∆

(
txU
,
1

)
)

2

+






,                                              (23)

and in the space domain,

(
ε
tx
,

1

)

=

(
∆

(
txU

)
)



.                                              (24)

Here I mean that if ‘damping’ coefficients 

λ  and 

µ  were zeroes then

3

both values  (
ε

)tx ,1

 and  (

1,txε

)
 would be constants.

Then in both time and space domains energy ‘invariant’ would look like,

10

(
ε
,
tx

)

=

(
∆

(

txU

)
)

In other words, without ‘damping’ coefficients we would have infinite

oscillations both in time and in space.

Generalization of ‘Boundary’ Conditions

We have described so far the situation when system was excited in some

point 

0x  with non-zero energy’s disturbance

) 0

 and zero disturbance

rate 

)

∆

txUd

.

Assuming the non-zero disturbance rate in initial point 

=x

0

 and time

=t

0

 doesn’t bring big changes in our previous reasoning. We have to consider

12

additionally the initial value 

0

 when we are solving equation (9) in

the second section.

Let me look now at case when the system is excited in some interval [

]a,0

at initial time 

0

. We may assume the regular condition with 

=t

∆

Other points in the interval (

 have initial values somewhere in the middle.

When we calculate the value 

(
1,txU∆

)

 for 

x >

 and 

>t

, the

interference of energy’s waves has to be taken into account.

Hence, for

 we have,

Interference of energy’s waves appears for bigger  1t . To simplify its

representation I denote 

 the value of energy’s disturbance

Disturbance Traveling and Wave Propagation

We have to distinct the concepts of velocity  c  of disturbance’s traveling

and velocity of wave propagation.

determined inside the model.

The former is an external value for our model while the latter one is

Indeed the velocity  w  of wave propagation is the ratio of the period of

oscillations in space, and the period of oscillations in time (or inverse ratio of the

corresponding frequencies).

Thus

Example One: Invariance of the Speed of Light

I want to underline again that velocity  w  of propagation of energy’s

disturbance is not the same as velocity  c  of traveling of energy itself.

This point becomes important when we address the phenomenon of the

speed of light.

If me move the system associated with energy’s level 

)tx,Φ
(

 with non-

zero velocity then the velocity  w  of wave propagation will remain the same in

new system, and will be described by equation (29).

Here I see the reason of negative outcome of Michelson-Morley

experiment, which started the creation of the theory of relativity [2, 3, 4].

9.

Example Two: Tsunami or ‘Harbor Wave’

It looks possible to apply the model to describe the phenomenon of

‘tsunami’.

An earthquake passes its energy to ocean water. This energy is

transformed into elevating of water column.

Using equations (17) – (19) we can obtain the value 

(
1,txU∆

)

 of energy’s

disturbance traveling on significant distances from the earthquake’s place.

Then we can calculate the height, on which the water column of particular

depth has to be elevated to convey the required amount of energy.

That value gives us the height of tsunami.

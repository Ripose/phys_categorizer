ABSTRACT

Orientation-dependent  imaging  of  human  lungs  is  demonstrated  using  inhaled  laser-polarized

3He gas and an open-access very-low-magnetic field (< 5 mT) MRI instrument.  This prototype

device employs a simple, low-cost electromagnet, with an open geometry that allows variation of

the orientation of the imaging subject in a two-dimensional plane.  Two-dimensional 3He images

were acquired with 2 mm in-plane resolution from a subject in two orientations: lying supine,

and sitting in a vertical position with one arm raised.  The images show clear differences in lung

shape and inhaled  3He gas distribution, consistent with the expected orientation dependence of

pulmonary physiology.

Keywords: orientation, lung imaging, open-access, very-low-field MRI

INTRODUCTION

It has long been known that pulmonary ventilation and perfusion are non-uniformly distributed

[1,2].  These non-uniformities have traditionally been attributed to the effects of gravity on the

lung [1,2].  However, recently this assumption has been called into question [3], and the issue is

now hotly debated [4,5].  Unfortunately, very few methods exist that allow for detailed studies of

human lung function under varying gravitational conditions – or varying body orientations. Thus,

pulmonary  physiology  would  benefit  greatly  from  the  development  of  minimally-invasive

methods to quantitatively image ventilation, perfusion, and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios in

subjects  in  variable  orientations.    Similarly,  pulmonary  medicine  would  benefit  from  the

development of a compact, portable system that allows monitoring of lung function for critically

ill patients in intensive care.  For example, such a diagnostic tool could serve to guide ventilator

management, such as “recruitment maneuvers” used to reinflate collapsed lung regions [6].

In recent years, laser-polarized 3He MRI [7] has become one of the most powerful methods for

studying lung structure and function [8,9].  This technique is now used with conventional, high-

field (~ 1 T) MRI instruments to make quantitative maps of human ventilation [10,11], to acquire

3He diffusion maps that yield lung passage airway size [12,13], and to monitor 3He relaxation as

an  indicator  of  alveolar  gas-space  O2  concentration  [14],  and  with  applications  to  many  lung

diseases [15].  However, the large superconducting magnets used in conventional high-field MRI

systems  restrict  human  subjects  to  lie  in  a  horizontal  orientation.    Therefore,  only  minimal

information regarding orientation effects can be obtained from conventional MRI scanners.  In

addition, the great size, weight and technical restrictions of clinical MRI systems requires that

patients be brought to the scanner.  For many critically ill patients, e.g., with lung diseases such

as  Acute  Respiratory  Distress  Syndrome  (ARDS),  the  requirement  of  being  moved  from  the

3

Intensive Care Unit is dangerous, time consuming, and expensive.  Thus, the potential medical

benefits of laser-polarized 3He MRI are not realized for many of the most needy patients.

To enable orientation-dependent lung imaging, and possibly a portable lung MRI system, we

have  developed  an  open-access,  very-low-field  MRI  system,  employing  a  four-coil

electromagnet  and  exploiting  the  practicality  of  laser-polarized  3He  MRI  at  magnetic  fields

<  10  mT  [16,17].    3He  nuclear  spin  polarization  of  ~  30%  can  be  created  with  a  laser-based

optical pumping process [7] prior to the MRI procedure and without the need of a large applied

magnetic field.  Such high spin polarization gives 3He gas a magnetization density similar to that

of water in ~ 1 T fields, despite the drastically lower spin density of the gas.  Thus the signal-to-

noise ratio (SNR) of laser-polarized noble gas MRI in animal or human lungs is only weakly

dependent on the applied magnetic field [16], and very-low-field MRI becomes practical.

We  previously  demonstrated  very-low-field  (~  2  mT)  imaging  of  small  samples  of  laser-

polarized 3He gas [16,17], obtaining SNR and image resolution comparable to high-field clinical

scanners.  In addition, we showed that the effects of magnetic susceptibility-induced background

gradients  in  the  imaging  sample  are  greatly  suppressed  for  low-field  MRI,  resulting  in  much

longer  spin  decoherence  times  for  3He  in  excised  animal  lungs  [16]:  T2*  ~  100  ms  at

2 mT, ~ 5 ms at 1.5 T.  Recently, other groups have recognized the benefits of low-field MRI of

laser-polarized gas, and have demonstrated human lung imaging at magnetic fields of 0.1 T [18-

19], 15 mT [20], and even 3 mT [21] using conventional, superconducting MRI scanners (some

charged to below-maximum field strength) that restrict the subject to a horizontal orientation.

Recently, Bidinosti et al. used a novel, vertically-oriented electromagnet operating at 3 mT to

image laser-polarized 3He gas inhaled into the lungs of a standing subject [22].  (This prototype

very-low-field MRI system does not allow variation of subject orientation.)

4

In this paper, we provide an overview of our prototype, very-low-field human MRI system.  This

system allows the subject to walk into position, and lung imaging to be performed at any body

orientation.  We also present initial two-dimensional human lung images, from a subject lying

horizontal and sitting vertically with one arm raised, and discuss ongoing development of an

upgraded very-low-field MRI instrument.

EXPERIMENTAL

Imager Design: Details of the design and operation of our prototype (first generation) very-low-

field human MRI system will be presented elsewhere.  Here, we provide a brief overview of the

design, and how it permits open-access and variable-body-orientation lung imaging.

The first-generation imager operated with an applied static magnetic field, B0, ranging from 0 -

70 G (0 – 7 mT).  The B0 field was created by two pairs of coils that measured 2 and 0.8 meters

in diameter (See Fig. 1).  The 2 m coils were held on a heavy aluminum frame and spaced ~ 80

cm apart.  The smaller coils were placed ~ 1 m apart and were mounted outside the large coils

[23].  Current was supplied to each pair of coils separately from two stable, high current power

supplies.    The  large  coils  were  typically  fed  with  ~  30  –  40  Amps,  while  the  smaller  coils

operated with ~ 20% of the current being sent to the larger coils.  Crude shimming to optimize B0

homogeneity was possible by adjusting the current in the small coils slightly with the large coils

at a fixed current.  This coil layout generated a field uniformity of ~ 1000 ppm over a diametrical

spherical volume of ~ 30 cm.

We  designed  and  constructed  planar  gradient  panels  to  provide  the  pulsed  magnetic  field

gradients,  thus  eliminating  another  restrictive  cylindrical  geometry  found  in  clinical  MRI

scanners.    These  planar  gradient  panels  were  mounted  just  inside  the  2  m  B0  coils,  and  thus

5

allowed variable-orientation lung imaging in an open-access gap of width ~ 75 cm.  The planar

gradient  panels  were  made  of  40  µm  thick  copper  foil  tape  placed  on  3  mm  thick  fiberglass

sheeting.  Three panels, for x, y and z gradients, were mounted together on each large B0 coil.

The winding pattern was obtained by calculating the resultant magnetic field gradient using the

software  package  Biot-Savart  [Ripplon  Software,  Burnaby,  Canada],  and  then  optimizing  a

figure-of-merit function by iteration to maximize gradient strength and linearity throughout a

spherical volume of ~ 60 cm diameter.  The resulting winding pattern was qualitatively similar to

those obtained with more sophisticated techniques [24].  The gradients were powered by Techron

8606 gradient amplifiers, operating at up to 140 A.  At maximum current, the z gradient panel

provided 0.38 G/cm, while the x and y panels provided 0.15 G/cm gradient strength.  The initial

human lung imaging demonstration described below did not require maximum gradient strength.

RF-frequency control was provided by a commercial Surrey Medical Imaging Systems (SMIS)

console, modified with a mix-down stage, to produce frequencies between 50 and 200 kHz.  RF

pulses from the SMIS was fed to a home-theater amplifier [Outlaw Audio, Durham, NH] that

provided up to 250 W of RF power in conjunction with a homebuilt second-stage amplifier.  The

pre-amplifier  was  a  Stanford  Research  Systems  model  560.    For  simplicity,  the  system  used

separate coils for B1 transmission and detection.  We employed a Helmholtz pair of  ~  50  cm

inner  diameter  (ID)  for  B1  transmission,  while  the  receive  coil  was  a  modified  cosine-theta

design  of  ~  30  cm  ID.    Ensuring  the  two  coils  remained  orthogonal  was  important  to  reduce

direct pick-up noise – thus the two coils were bolted together to maintain orthogonality.  Both

coils could be tuned to different frequencies with external capacitative “resonance boxes”.  The

coils had quality factors Q ~ 50 - 100, implying operating bandwidths of ~ 1- 2 kHz at the typical

3He  Larmor  frequency  ~  100  kHz.    Such  narrow  bandwidths,  considerably  less  than  typical

6

imaging spectral widths of 10 – 20 kHz, required images to be post-processed to remove the

convolved effect of the frequency response of the coil.

To improve SNR, the B0, gradient and B1 coils were housed inside an RF shielded room of steel

plate on 1 inch particle board.  The room was designed to attenuate RF interference in the range

10 kHz to 10 MHz by up to 100 dB.  The imager hardware is photographed in Fig. 1.

MRI Techniques: For the demonstration human lung imaging presented below, we tuned the B1

coils to 127 kHz, and set B0 to 3.8 mT (38 G).  We modified standard SMIS imaging sequences

for gradient echoes [25] to minimize TE, and to permit non-sequential phase encoding and low

flip angle excitation pulses.  The RF pulses we employed were nominally sinc-shaped and of 1

ms  duration.    For  human  imaging,  the  2D  (no  slice  selection)  gradient  echo  sequence  had  a

spectral width = 16.67 kHz, acquired field of view = 50 cm, acquired data-set of 128 × 64 points,

excitation flip angles of ~ 8º, TE/TR ~ 10/100 ms, and 1 signal averaging scan.  We zero-filled

the  dataset  to  256  ×  256  points  before  fast-Fourier-transformation,  giving  a  final  in-plane

resolution of ~ 2 mm.

Polarized 3He Production and Delivery: We produced laser-polarized 3He gas for human lung

imaging via spin-exchange optical pumping using Rb vapor [7].  The modular 3He polarization

apparatus  included  gas  storage,  transport,  and  delivery  stages  that  were  similar  to  the  129Xe

polarization instrument described in [26].  The polarization cells were ~ 80 cm3 in volume, and

made of GE-180 aluminosilicate glass. Each cell was enclosed in its own, dedicated Pyrex outer

jacket  that  served  as  an  oven,  and  attached  to  the  polarizer  (and  hence  the  gas  supply  and

storage) with a high-pressure Pyrex valve.  The polarization cells could be easily removed from

the polarizer, allowing diagnostic 3He NMR to be performed directly on the cell.

7

A magnetic field of ~ 1 mT was generated by a Helmholtz coil pair mounted on the polarizer,

thereby providing a quantization access for optical pumping.  The polarizer was located adjacent

to, but outside, the RF shielded room.  For each experiment, we filled a polarization cell with ~ 5

- 6 bar of  3He and 0.1 bar of N2, heated the cell to ~ 200°C, and applied ~ 60 W of circularly

polarized  light  at  795  nm,  provided  by  two  fiber-coupled  laser  diode  arrays  [Coherent,  Inc.,

Santa Clara, CA].

After spin-exchange optical pumping for ~ 2 - 4 hours, the 3He nuclear spin polarization reached

~  20  –  40  %.    We  then  expanded  the  polarized  gas  from  the  pumping  cell  into  a  previously

evacuated glass and Teflon compressor for storage and delivery.  For human imaging, polarized

3He was delivered via Teflon tubing through a feedthrough in the RF shielded room to a delivery

manifold adjacent to the subject.  This manifold consisted of a Tedlar bag, vacuum and inert gas

ports, and a Teflon tube used as a mouthpiece.  The 3He T1 in both the compressor and the Tedlar

bar was ~ 20 min.

Human Imaging Protocol: The subject in the demonstration human lung imaging was a healthy,

47 year-old male.  Fig. 2 shows the subject in the very-low-field magnet, in both horizontal and

vertical  orientations.    Just  after  a  relaxed  expiration,  the  subject  inhaled, through  the  Teflon

mouthpiece attached to the Tedlar bag, ~ 500 cm3 of laser-polarized 3He gas, followed by a small

breath of air to wash the helium out of the large airways and distribute it throughout the lung.

The MR imaging sequence began immediately after inhalation, while the subject maintained a

breath-hold  for  ~  20  –  30  seconds.    All  human  experiments  were  performed  according  to  a

protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of New Hampshire.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Fig. 3 shows the demonstration human 3He MRI lung images, acquired without slice selection at

an applied field strength of 3.8 mT (38 G), with the subject in a horizontal orientation and a

vertical orientation with one arm raised.  Both images have a coronal orientation, with the lungs

viewed  in  an  anterioposterior  direction,  i.e.,  the  subject’s  right  lung  is  on  the  left  side  of  the

images.    The  horizontal  image  (Fig.  3a)  shows  well  defined  lung-lobes,  with  a  characteristic

concave  shape  at  the  bottom  as  the  diaphragm  pushes  against  the  lungs.    A  region  of  lower

intensity at the medial aspect of the left lung is consistent with the location of the heart.  The gas

distribution  is  very  uniform  throughout  both  lobes,  as  expected  for  a  healthy  subject  in  this

orientation.    The  vertical  image  (Fig.  3b)  shows  the  lungs  to  be  considerably  distended  in

comparison to the horizontal case, and indicates a less uniform gas distribution than when the

subject was horizontal.

The image quality and SNR provided by the prototype very-low-field MRI system was limited

by several technical imperfections: (i) mediocre B0 homogeneity, measured to be ~ 1000 ppm in

a 30 cm diameter volume at the magnet’s center, resulting in T2* ~ 5 – 10 ms for 3He inhaled in

human lungs; (ii) excessive noise in the receive coil due to cross-talk from the B1 transmit coil;

and (iii) poor heat dissipation in the planar gradient panels, which required long delays (TR ~

100 ms) between rows.  As a consequence of these imperfections, sufficient SNR (~ 30) for a 2D

image with in-plane resolution of 2 mm could only be achieved without slice selection and with

relatively long image acquisition times (~ 7 s).  Hence, the demonstration lung images of Fig. 3

do not show airway structural detail, and suffer from artifacts due to subject motion.

9

The  images  of  Fig.  3  were  obtained  after  post-processing  to  remove  the  convolved  response

function of the RF coil from the raw image data.  Due to the high Q, and corresponding low coil

bandwidth (~ 1 kHz), of the RF coils, raw images suffered significant attenuation away from the

center frequency of the RF coils.  The response function was obtained from rows of the image

data-set  that  only  contained  noise.    The  entire  data-set  was  then  divided  by  this  function,

resulting in a flat noise floor across the entire image [27].  The images were obtained without

using a variable flip angle to ensure reproducible transverse magnetization from each successive

RF pulse [28], as the excitation flip angle was sufficiently low to ensure minimal variation in

magnetization over the first 40 – 50 phase-encoding rows of the image, resulting in an artifact-

free  image.    Finally,  while  the  imaging  gradients,  which  were  below  0.5  G/cm,  are  low  by

traditional standards, such values  reduce  diffusive  signal  attenuation,  which  is  a  problem  for

imaging gas samples at traditional field strengths [16,29].  Additionally, the maximum gradient

across the sample remained low in comparison to B0, avoiding concomitant field effects [30].

A  significant  benefit  of  operating  at  ~  100  kHz  was  evident  in  our  first  demonstration  lung

images; namely operating well below the frequency range in which “sample noise” dominates

human MRI [17].  Indeed, we found that insertion of the subject into and out of the RF coils had

no loading effect whatsoever, thereby eliminating tuning/matching errors in addition to making

sample noise insignificant.  Conversely, environmental noise is important at low frequencies.

The  frequency  spectrum  ~  100  kHz  is  crowded,  and  many  electronic  components  of  an  MRI

system, from computer monitors to the gradient amplifiers, emit noise in this range. RF shielding

and line filters for conventional MRI instruments are optimized to eliminate noise in the 10 – 60

MHz range, not below that.  In our first generation system we obtained significant reductions in

pick-up  noise  from  the  gradient  amplifiers  by  employing  passive  and  active  inductors  on  the

10

gradient  lines  –  however,  there  is  room  for  improvement  on  the  second-generation  system

currently under development.

CONCLUSION

We obtained the first in vivo human lung images of inhaled laser-polarized 3He gas as a function

of subject orientation.  The subject was imaged while lying horizontal, and sitting vertically with

one arm raised, in an open-access MRI instrument operating at an applied magnetic field of 3.8

mT (38 G).  The two-dimensional images show distinct differences in lung shape, size, and gas

distribution  as  a  function  of  orientation.    Image  quality  and  SNR  was  limited  by  technical

imperfections  in  the  prototype  very-low-field  MRI  system,  including  (i)  mediocre  B0

homogeneity, (ii) cross-talk noise between the transmit and receive B1 coils, and (iii) poor heat

dissipation  in  the  pulsed  field  gradient  panels.    We  are  currently  developing  an  optimized

second-generation  very-low-field  instrument  to  enable  detailed  studies  of  lung  function,

ventilation and perfusion as a function of orientation.  With further development, very-low-field

MRI may be available in a portable instrument, allowing noble gas lung imaging for patients in

intensive  care  units,  as  well  as  for  those  with  implants,  prostheses,  claustrophobia  or  acute

illnesses who have been denied access to MRI in its traditional form.

Figure 1.  Photograph of the first-generation open-access, very-low-field human imager.  The

letters on the figure denote: A: the 2 m principal B0 coils;  B: the 80 cm secondary B0 coils;  C:

planar pulsed-field gradient panels;  D: B1  transmit  and  receive  coils  for  human  imaging;    E:

support  table  for  horizontal  human  imaging.    The  design  provides  for  a  gap  of  ~  75  cm  for

subject  access  between  the  planar  gradient  panels,  and  permits  complete  two-dimensional

rotation of subjects in this plane, once the support table is removed.  The entire apparatus is sited

in a modular RF-shielded room.

Figure 2.  Photographs of a subject in the first-generation open-access, very-low-field human

imager.  a) Subject on the support table, ready for imaging in the horizontal position.  In this

orientation,  the  two  B1  coils  were  bolted  to  the  table,  ensuring  that  their  position  remained

independent of the subject.  b) Subject sitting on a stool with one arm raised, ready for vertical

orientation imaging.  Removable supports hold the B1 coils at the correct height, again ensuring

their position was independent of the subject.

Figure 3.  MRI of inhaled laser-polarized 3He gas acquired at B0 = 3.8 mT (38 G).  A standard

FLASH gradient echo sequence was used, with TE/TR = 10/100ms, flip angle α = 8º, NS = 1,

data size = 128 × 64.  Total image acquisition time was 7 seconds.  a) Image acquired when the

subject was lying horizontally. b) Image acquired while subject was sitting vertically with one

arm  raised.    This  image  suffers  from  motion  artifacts  (vertical  streaking)  due  to  subject

movement during the 7 sec imaging time.  Both images visualize the lungs as if looking at the

subject from the front – i.e., the subject’s right lung lobe is on the left of the image.

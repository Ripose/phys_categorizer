INTRODUCTION 

This paper describes the basic features of the plasma heating in spherical tokamak Globus-

M.  The  experiments  were  performed  in  the  following  range  of  plasma  parameters:  the 

toroidal magnetic field 0.4 T near the magnetic axis, the plasma current 0.15-0.25 MA, the 

plasma average density (1-7) 10

 m

, the plasma minor radius 0.2-0.24 m, the plasma major 

19

-3

radius  0.32-0.36  m,  the  vertical  elongation  1.3-1.8.  The  neutral  beam  injection  (NBI)  was 

used  as  the  basic  method  for  the  plasma  auxiliary  heating.  In  the  experiments  the  injector 

could  generate  a  hydrogen  or  deuterium  beam  with  the  energy  of  30  keV  and  the  neutral 

beam power of 0.6 MW. The beam was co-injected relatively the plasma current direction in 

the tokamak midplane. The beam axis was aimed into the inner plasma region at the radius R 

=  0.3  m.  The  experiments  were  carried  out  after  a  careful  beam  focusing  and  outgasing  of 

the  the  vacuum  vessel  inlet  port.  We  employed  the  glow  discharge  cleaning  and  the 

boronization  technique  [1]  for  the  vacuum  vessel  conditioning.  About  50%  of  the  plasma 

faced surface was protected with graphite tiles. After the boronization the plasma radiation 

losses  did  not  exceed  10-15%  of  the  ohmic  power.  In  the  described  experiments  the  most 

interesting  effects  were  observed  in  the  ion  temperature  behavior  in  ohmically  heated 

plasmas as well as during neutral beam injection. For this reason the present paper is mostly 

concentrated  on  the  features  of  the  ion  energy  balance.  The  ion  temperature  in  the  plasma 

core  was measured by  means of the 12-channels neutral particle  analyzer (NPA) ACORD-

12.  The  NPA  provided  the  simultaneous  measurements  of  deuterium  and  hydrogen  energy 

spectra and the percentage of both isotopes. The electron temperature profile was measured 

with  the  laser  Thomson  scattering  diagnostic  in  five  spatial  points  positioned  along  the 

plasma  major  radius.  The  electron  density  was  monitored  by  1  mm  interferometer  along 

three vertical chords. The estimates of electron temperature in the plasma core were derived 

also from the slope of SXR spectra. 

OH Regime 

Some  characteristic  features  in  the  ion  temperature  behavior  were  described  in  [2].  It  was 

found  that  the  ion  temperature  in  the  plasma  core  appeared  to  be  higher  than  the  values 

predicted  by  the  Artsimovich  scaling  law  [3]  Ti~(nIpBtR

heating  in  the  case  of  the  neoclassical  plateau  regime  in  the  conventional  tokamak.  The 

experiments  revealed  much  stronger,  almost  linear  dependence  of  Ti  upon  the  plasma 

current.  This  dependence  was  well  confirmed  by  1D  transport  code  using  the  neoclassical 

transport coefficients.

In this work we continued the study of 

ion  temperature  dependence  upon  the 

plasma  parameters.  Fig.1  shows  the 

ion  temperature  in  the  plasma  core  as 

a  function  of  the  plasma  average 

density.  The  density  control  was 

provided  by 

the  gas 

(deuterium) 

puffing  from  the  high  magnetic  field 

side.  In  the  experiment  the  density 

 

was  scanned  in  the  range  of  (0.8  –

much stronger density dependence of the ion temperature. From the model we can estimate 

the ion energy confinement time determined as τEi = Wi/Pe-i, where Wi – volume integrated

to be a weak function of the plasma density which changed within 6÷7 ms in the investigated 

density range.

The NBI technique in Globus-M experiment 

is  described  in  [5].  In  the  experiments 

described  in  this  paper  we  compared  the 

effect of the plasma heating by means of the 

hydrogen  and  deuterium  beams  injection 

into  deuterium  plasmas.  This  comparative 

experiment  was  carried  out  during  one 

experimental  session.  In  both  cases  the 

beam  parameters  were  approximately  the 

same:  0.6  MW  of  the  beam  power  and  30 

keV  of  the  beam  energy.  For  the  hydrogen 

beam it means that the particle velocity was 

by  a  factor  of  2

steady  state  plasma  current  of  0.15-0.16  MA.  In  both  cases  of  the  hydrogen  and  the 

deuterium  beam  we  observed  approximately  the  same  effect  of  ion  heating.  The  beam 

injection was accompanied by a factor of 2-2.5 rise of the plasma density and the appearance 

of  sawtooth  oscillations.  These  phenomena  can  be  a  possible  explanation  of  the  saturation 

and  then  the  following  decrease  in  the  ion  temperature  during  the  NBI  pulse.  At  the  same 

time we did not observe any significant variations in the emission of typical impurity lines 

such  as  CIII,  OIII  etc,  that  indicated  the  absence  of  plasma  additional  contamination  with 

light impurities during NBI. The electron temperature in the plasma bulk estimated from the 

slope of SXR spectra also did not change significantly in NBI experiments. 

 

Discussion and Conclusions 

The ion temperature behavior in the plasma bulk in OH experiments is well described by the 

neoclassical transport coefficients without any additional correction. The absolute values and 

the Ti parametric dependences differ from the Artsimovich scaling law for the neoclassical 

plateau  regime.  The  modeling  demonstrates  small  ion  collisionality  in  wide  zone  in  the 

plasma volume in most Globus-M ohmic experiments: ν∗i = νii/νbi << 1, where νbi – banana

described 

by 

a 

preliminary 

ASTRA  code  simulation  [6].  A 

typical  balance  of  the  hydrogen 

beam  power  as  a  function  of 

plasma  density  is  shown  in  Fig.6. 

In  the  experiment  shown  in  Fig.4 

the  beam  was  injected  into  the 

plasma  with  relatively  low  initial 

density <n> = (1.5-2)×10

 m

. In 

19

-3

this density range the beam power 

absorbed  by  electrons  and  by  ions 

(Fig.6) is about 10-15% of the total beam power. This power is much smaller of the ohmic 

heating  power  and  therefore  it  can’t  provide  a  significant  increase  in  the  electron 

temperature.  From  the  experiment  we  can  roughly  estimate  the  power  absorbed  by  ions  as 

Pbm_i  ~  ∆Wi/∆t,  where  ∆Wi  ~  ∆<nTi>  is  a  variation  of  the  ion  thermal  energy  during  the 

starting NBI period. This estimate for the case in Fig.4 gives the value of Pbm_i ~ 60-80 kW 

that well agrees with ASTRA code simulation. The value of the electron-ion heat power in 

ohmically  heated  plasma  calculated by  means  of  the  transport  code  Pe-i  is  about  20-25 kW 

which  is  small  in  comparison  with  Pbm_I.  It  explains  a  strong  ion  temperature  increase  in 

Fig.4  for  the  case  of  the  beam  injection  into  a  low  density  plasma.  In  the  case  of  higher 

densities  the  values  of  Pbm_i  and  Pe-I  become  comparable,  and  the  experimentally  observed 

increase of Ti is smaller. In Fig.6 the difference between the absorbed beam power Pabs and 

the  total  power  lunched  by  electrons  and  ions  Pbm_ei  is  described  by  the  beam  particle 

particles velocity charge-exchange losses. A significant role of the charge exchange losses in 

NB  power  balance  is  partly  confirmed  by  the  experimentally  observed  decrease  of  the  ion 

temperature  in  plasma  shots  immediately  after  the  vessel  boronization.  After  the 

boronization a strong external gas puffing is necessary to sustain the plasma density. Under 

these conditions the NPA detects a significant rise of neutral fluxes.

Abstract 

In  the  perspective  of  long  term  geological  storage,  high  level  nuclear  wastes  will  be 

overpacked in low carbon steel containers. In that context, we have studied the influence of 

oxygen dissolved in water on iron corrosion. Therefore, leaching experiments were performed 

in  desaerated  D2O  and  in  aerated  H2O  and  a  kinetic  study  of  iron  corrosion  under  proton 

irradiation  was  lead  in  aqueous  media  with  two  different  dissolved  oxygen  concentrations. 

The  leaching  experiments  underline  the  major  role  of  dissolved  oxygen  in  oxydoreduction 

reactions which take place as far as iron is in contact with water. But the kinetic study of iron 

corrosion under irradiation put in evidence the balance between the oxydoreduction reactions 

and the corrosion rate induced by radicals species generated by water radiolysis.

1. Introduction  

 

In  the  perspective  of  long  term  geological  disposal,  high  level  nuclear  wastes  will  be 

overpacked  in  low  carbon  steel  containers.  In  a  recent  paper  [1],  the  influence  of  water 

radiolysis  on  iron  corrosion  was  studied  by  using  12  MeV  protons  with  a  30  nA  intensity. 

Experiments were realised with 2 different water media : aerated deionised water (H2O) and 

heavy water (D2O) packaged under argon. It was shown that after a two hour irradiation time, 

the iron loss on the sample irradiated in aerated water was larger than 60 nm thick but was 

negligible in case of desaerated D2O medium. It was suggested that, as observed by Burns [2], 

the  enhancement  of  corrosion  in  aerated  water  was  due  to  O2  dissolved  species.  Another 

unexpected result is the similar hydrogen profiles observed in samples irradiated in desaerated 

D2O  and  aerated  H2O.  Such  results  could  be  attributed  to  the  well  known  D/H  isotopic 

exchange but it was also suggested that hydrogen, because of its high diffusivity, comes from 

the wet air and diffuses inside the iron foil.  

The aims of the work presented in this paper are respectively: 

- to study the impact of dissolved oxygen in oxydoreduction reactions which take place at the 

iron water interface. For that purpose, two experiments were performed: 

i)  The  comparison  between  the  iron  surface  composition  evolution  after  leaching 

experiments in desaerated D2O and in aerated H2O. 

ii) The study of the iron corrosion kinetics under proton irradiation in aqueous media 

with two different dissolved oxygen concentrations. 

-  to  answer  the  relevant  question:  do  hydrogen  ions,  produced  in  wet  air  by  irradiation, 

migrate through the whole sample thickness? In order to avoid radiolysis effects which could 

 

 

3 

hide  migration  of  hydrogen  species,  an  irradiation  experiment  was  performed  in  which  the 

irradiation cell was filled with argon instead of water. 

2. Influence of oxygen dissolved species in water on iron aqueous corrosion 

2.1. Leaching experiments in aerated H2O and in desaerated D2O  

Leaching experiments were performed at 40°C during 150 hours in closed vessel on pure iron 

(99.995 %) samples (250 µm thick). To avoid isotopic exchange [3], the sample was analysed 

by ion beam techniques using the 4 MV Van de Graaff accelerator of the “Institut de Physique 

Nucléaire”  of  Lyon  (IPNL),  just  after  the  end  of  the  leaching  procedure.  The  hydrogen 

profiles were measured using Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA) induced by 1.7 MeV 

alpha particles. The deuterium profiling was performed by Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) 

using  the  D(3He,a )p  nuclear  reaction.  In  this  reaction,  the  difference in energy between the 

outgoing  channel  and  the  entrance  one  is  18.35  MeV.  Thus,  the  energy  of  the  emitted  a

 

particles  is  much  larger  than  the  3He  incident  energy.  In  order  to  favour  the  deuterium 

concentration  measurement  at  the  sample  surface,  a  15°  glancing  angle  was  used.  The 

experimental  set  up  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  a

  energy  distribution  was  measured  at  a  30° 

detection  angle,  while  the  scattered  3He  ions  are  stopped  in  a  6.5  µm  thick  mylar  absorber. 

Therefore,  the  a

  detection  energy  resolution  is  50  keV.  A  800  keV  incident  energy  was 

chosen  because,  in  the  600  to  800  keV  energy  range,  the  reaction  cross  section  can  be 

considered as constant. This approximation is relevant for two reasons: 

i)  W.E.  Kunz  [4]  has  shown  that  in  the  100-800  keV  incident  energy  range,  the  a

 

particle angular distribution is isotropic. 

ii) The reaction cross section [5] varies smoothly in the 600-800 keV energy range. 

A  deuterium  standard  elaborated  by  ion  implantation  in  a  Si3N4/Si  sample  was  used  to 

normalize the concentration measurements [6].

It  must  be  noted  that  NRA  and  ERDA  are  elemental  analysis  but  other  characterisation 

techniques have identified hydroxyl species [6]. As shown in Fig. 2, at a 40 nm iron depth, the 

order  of  magnitude  of  the  [H]/[D]  ratio  is  150.  Actually,  the  isotopic  effect  on  the  slowing 

down  of  D2O  reaction  velocity  [7]  compared  to  H2O  can  explain  a  maximum  [H]/[D]  ratio 

value equal to two. Thus, the very low deuterium concentration corresponding to desaerated 

D2O  leaching,  compared  to  the  high  hydrogen  concentration  value  in  case  of  leaching  in 

aerated H2O, emphasizes the major role of dissolved oxygen on the reaction at the Fe/water 

interface. 

These oxydoreduction reactions are:  

2 Fe ﬁ

 2 Fe2+ + 4 e- ,  

 

O2 + 4e- + 2 H2O ﬁ

 4 HO- ,   

 

 

2 Fe + O2 + 2 H2O ﬁ

 2 Fe2+ + 4 HO- .

(3)=(1)+(2) 

These reactions also occurred for iron corrosion in wet air [8]. 

The  following  part  deals  with  the  influence  of  dissolved  oxygen  concentration  on  aqueous 

iron corrosion under proton irradiation.  

2.2 Study of the iron aqueous corrosion kinetics under proton irradiation  

The  iron  corrosion  kinetics  under  proton  irradiation  was  performed  in  two  aqueous  media: 

aerated  H2O  in  which  dissolved  oxygen  is  in  equilibrium  with  air  and  H2O  under  argon 

bubbling called H2O(Ar) medium. The dissolved oxygen concentrations are respectively equal 

to 2.5x10-4 mol L-1 in aerated H2O and 2.3x10-6 mol L-1 in H2O(Ar) medium. They have been 

controlled by the voltamperometry technique. 

Let us remind the experimental conditions which were already described in details in [1]. The 

pure  iron  samples  are  europium  implanted  on  the  polished  face  at  a  800  keV  energy  and  a 

5x1015 at. cm-2 fluence. This europium tracer is used to measure the iron loss thickness in the 

 

 

5 

corrosion  process.  In  order  to  ensure,  that  all  the  studied  samples  present  the  same  surface 

state  before  irradiation,  a  pre-irradiation  procedure  has  been  defined.  The  iron  foil  is  the 

entrance  window  of  the  irradiation  cell  (Fig.  3),  its  polished  side  being  put  in  contact  with 

H2O during 12 hours. Then, the cell water is changed. After this procedure, a sample called 

“blank”  is used as reference and the other samples are irradiated.  

The  irradiation  experiments  were  performed  with  the  CERI  (Centre  d’Etudes  et  de 

Recherches par Irradiation) cyclotron at Orleans, which delivers a 12 MeV proton beam. The 

irradiation  set  up  is  presented  in  Fig.  3.  Irradiations  were  carried  out  with  a  30  nA  beam 

intensity, the irradiation time varying from 5 to 75 minutes. 

Ion  beam  analysis  (Rutherford  Backscattering  Spectrometry  (RBS)  and  ERDA)  were 

performed using 1.7 MeV a

 particles. The SIMNRA program was used to simulate the energy 

spectra obtained both by RBS and ERDA so as to determine the atomic concentration profiles 

of  europium,  oxygen  and  hydrogen.  For  a  given  sample  analysed  by  RBS  and  ERDA,  the 

analysis  was  done  by  iterations,  taking  always  into  account,  in  the  simulations  files,  the 

europium, oxygen and hydrogen concentrations. 

The  iron  loss  thickness  deduced  from  the  europium  signal  vanishing  is  presented  in  Fig.  4. 

The iron loss velocities, calculated from a linear regression, are respectively 1.7 nm min-1 in 

case of aerated water and 1.1 nm min-1 in case of H2O(Ar) medium. Although the dissolved 

oxygen  concentration  ratio  in  respectively  H2O  and  H2O(Ar)  is  100,  the  iron  corrosion 

velocity  ratio  is  less  than  two.  This  result  can  be  explained  by  radiolysis  effects  occurring 

under proton irradiation even in desaerated medium. The crucial role on the corrosion process 

of the radical species formed near the sample surface was also observed in reference [9]. 

Indeed, in desaerated water, the radical and molecular species due to water radiolysis induced 

the following reactions: 

•
 + Fe2+ ﬁ
H+ + H

 H2 + Fe3+ ,

The global reaction is :

Then the global reaction is :

In aerated water, the reaction (4) does not occur but the reactions (8) and then (9) take place. 

O2 + 4 H+ + 4 Fe2+ ﬁ

 2 H2O + 4 Fe3+. 

(10)=(8)+(9)+(5) or =(8)+(9)+(6) 

The Fig. 5 displays a comparison of oxygen and hydrogen profiles obtained in case of a 45 

minutes  irradiation  in  two  media  (2.5x10-4  mol  L-1  in  aerated  H2O  and  2.3x10-6  mol  L-1  in 

H2O(Ar)).  These  irradiations  lead  respectively  to  105  and  77  nm  iron  losses.  At  a  100  nm 

depth,  the  hydrogen  concentration  for  both  cases  are  similar  (around  10  at.  %),  while  the 

oxygen concentrations are significantly different. 

In fact, the hydrogen yield observed at the iron surface of the H2O(Ar) irradiated sample can 

•
 
be  related  to  the  hydrogen  radical  species  formed  in  desaerated  water  radiolysis.  These  H

radicals can either induce reactions (reaction (4)) or migrate in the iron sample. During their 

short mean life time (around 10-6 s), they can migrate in the iron foil subsurface (up to 100 

nm) as the hydrogen diffusion coefficient is large and range between 10-4 and 10-8 cm2 s-1 at 

25°C [10,11]. 

Another hydrogen origin can be the charged species induced by proton irradiation in the 4 mm 

thick humid air gap between the titanium window and the iron foil (Fig. 3). Considering the 

high  hydrogen  diffusion  coefficient  in  iron,  it  was  necessary  to  check  this  hypothesis. 

Moreover,  it  must  be  noted  that  at  much  lower  concentration  (10-6  at.  %)  hydrogen 

permeation in iron has been measured [6].

IV Hydrogen permeation test 

The irradiation experiments were performed using the 4 MV Van de Graaff accelerator of the 

IPNL which delivers a 3 MeV proton beam. As shown in Fig. 6, the proton beam is extracted 

from the beam line vacuum to the atmosphere by crossing a 5 µm thick havar window. The 

external proton beam enters the irradiation cell through the studied 10 µm thick iron foil. To 

avoid any radiolysis effect, the irradiation cell is not filled with water but with argon. During 

irradiation,  the  beam  intensity  was  set  to  10  nA,  and  the  irradiation  time  was  equal  to  90 

minutes. The Relative atmosphere Humidity (RH) in the 8 mm gap between the havar window 

and  the  iron  foil  is  controlled  with  a  Hygropalm  humidity  controller  and  fixed  to  45  %. 

Wayne-Siek  et  al.  [12]  have  studied  the  charged  species  created  in  wet  atmosphere  under 

irradiation around the same RH. They have shown that more than 88 % of these species are 

H+(H2O)n  clusters.  It  can  be  assumed  that  these  clusters  decompose  at  the  iron  surface 

allowing the hydrogen penetration. 

After  irradiation,  ERDA  analysis  was  performed  on  both  interfaces:  air/Fe  and  Fe/Ar.  The 

results  are  presented  in  Fig.  7.  The  16 at. % hydrogen concentration measured at the Fe/Ar 

interface corresponds to the sample surface contamination, while it decreases very rapidly to a 

very small value. At the air/Fe interface, the hydrogen concentration stands around 10 at. % 

up  to  100  nm  depth.  This  result  shows  that  hydrogen  diffusion  from  the  air/Fe  interface 

through the foil is not observed.  

V Conclusion  

In this paper, we have shown that aqueous iron corrosion under proton irradiation is increased 

for  high  oxygen  dissolved  concentrations.  Corrosion  even  in  desaerated  water  under 

8 

•
•
 radicals which 
 and HO
irradiation has been evidenced. It is explained by the formation of H

•
 radicals can either migrate in the iron subsurface 
is large even in desaerated water. These H

or induce corrosion process. 

The  similarity  of  hydrogen  profiles  observed  at  the  Fe/water  interface  for  irradiation 

performed  either  in  oxygen  rich  or  oxygen  poor  media  has  been  pointed  out.  The  origin  of 

hydrogen enrichment at the Fe/water interface has been explained by the water radiolysis and 

not by the hydrogen diffusion from the air/Fe interface through the iron foil.

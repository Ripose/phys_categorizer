Abstract 
Laser  illumination  of  tissue  results  in  a  characteristic  fluorescence  emission 
spectrum  whose  features  depend  on  the  type  of  tissue,  viz.,  healthy,  adenoma  or 
malignant.  Hence  measurement  of  the  fluorescence  is  potentially  a  rapid  and 
reliable  diagnostic  method.  We  have  applied  the  technique  to  thyroid  tissues  and 
found  that  judicious  normalization  of  the  fluorescence  spectrum  reveals  a  close 
correlation between spectral shape and tissue type. Hence the pathological state of 
the  tissue  can  be  unambiguously  identified  from  the  laser-induced  fluorescence 
spectrum. The method is rapid and portable and is therefore eminently suitable for 
use during operations. 

Most living tissue fluoresces in one way or another. The challenge is to harness the phenomenon 

in  such  a  way  that  it  is  useful  to  the  surgeon.  Here  we  examine  the  laser-induced  fluorescence  of 

thyroid  tissues.  It  turns  out  that  the  fluorescence  spectra  can  be  captured  in  such  a  way  that 

unambiguous  differentiation  between  normal  (healthy),  adenoma  and  malignant  tumours  can  be 

Many  forms  of  pre-cancerous  changes  are  difficult  to  detect  and  diagnose  using  conventional 

techniques,  which  require  histological  examination  of  biopsies  obtained  from  visible  lesions,  or 

random  surveillance  biopsies  [1,2].  These  techniques  not  only  often  yield  ambiguous  results,  but 

they are also slow. What is needed is a method for diagnosis that can be used during an operation, to 

reliably identify malignant tumours, adenomas and healthy regions within a second. 

Laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS). Biological tissue is a turbid optical medium, in 

which  light  from  an  incident  laser  beam  first  undergoes  Fresnel  reflexion  from  the  tissue  surface. 

The rest of the beam is transmitted into the tissue and its fate is dominated by absorption or multiple 

scattering or both. The relation between absorption and scattering depends upon the wavelength of 

the laser radiation and the optical properties of the tissue. In the ultraviolet range the thyroid tissue is

a strong absorber. The primary fluorescence centres for ultraviolet radiation are native fluorophors 

such as tryptophan, collagen, elastin and NADH [3]. 

Thyroid tissue samples were obtained from 10 different individuals as solid chunks a few mm 

thick. Each sample was divided into two parts, one half going for histo-morphological examination 

and the  other for the fluorescence measurements. The latter were placed in a spectroscopic quartz 

tube and illuminated with 10 ns, 337 nm pulses from a nitrogen laser at a repetition rate of 100 Hz. 

The  energy  per  pulse  was  0.04  mJ.  The  beam  was  focused  into  a  spot  100  µm  in  diameter  at  the 

front  surface  of  the  tissue.  Fluorescent  emission  was  collected  from  the  front  surface  and  passed 

through  the  entrance  slit  of  a  DFS-452  double  diffraction  spectrograph/monochromator  (1200 

grooves/mm).  Empty  tubes  neither  absorbed  nor  emitted,  but  showed  only  Fresnel  reflexion.  A 

UNIPAN-233    selective  nanovoltmeter  (working  in  repetitive  pulse  mode)  was  used  to  read  the 

output from the spectrograph photomultiplier. Emission spectra were recorded from 350 to 600 nm. 

Measurements were made at several different spots on each sample. 

Examination of many samples of different types revealed that the fluorescence emission spectra 

had  the  following  three  features:  a  rather  constant  peak  centred  at  465  nm,  a  peak  of  variable 

intensity  centred  at  395  nm,  and  a  rising  background  starting  at  about  420  nm  and  increasing 

towards shorter wavelengths. Figure 1 shows the fluorescence emission spectra from three different 

tissue types,  normal (healthy), adenoma and  malignant. The spectra have been normalized to give 

the same peak emission intensity at 465 nm. This normalization is an essential step for exploiting the 

full power of the LIFS technique. 

The  key  observation  for  making  the  fluorescent  emission  into  a  surgically  useful  diagnostic 

technique  was  that  malignant  tumours,  adenomas  and  healthy  tissue  have  distinctly  different 

relations between the intensities of these three features. Malignant cancerous tissue is dominated by 

the rising background, and adenomas by the peak at 395 nm. 

Although very roughly speaking adenoma gives a spectrum intermediate between the spectra of 

healthy  and  malignant  tissue,  the  different  spectral  lineshapes  make  it  possible  to  unambiguously 

differentiate  mixed  healthy  and  malignant  tissue  from  adenoma.  This  is  made  clear  in  Figure  2, 

which  shows  two  samples  of  intermediate  character.  Indeed,  the  averaged  spectra  of  the  extreme 

forms (healthy and malignant) can be fitted as a linear combination to the mixed spectra and hence 

used to quantitatively determine the fractions of normal and malignant tissue in the sample, or, in 

effect, the pathological degree. 

LIFS  is  a  novel  optical  method  developed  to  probe the state of living  cells in situ without the 

need  for  tissue  removal.  It  is  useful  for  real-time,  noninvasive  medical  imaging  starting  from  the 

very early stages of disease. LIFS makes it possible to distinguish between the emission of native 

fluorophors  in  normal  and  different  types  of  abnormal  human  cells.  The  fluorescence  spectrum  is 

analysed  to  provide  qualitative  and  quantitative  information  about  the  states  of  biomolecules  and 

their  variations  across  the  tissue.  As  LIFS  operates  on  the  molecular  level,  it  is  a  robust  and 

powerful  tool  for  detection  of  different  pathologies  in  optically  accessible  organs,  without  being 

influenced by other properties of the tissue, such as the age of its donor. 

The  rapidity  of  the  diagnosis  (within  a  fraction  of  a  second)  makes  the  technique  eminently 

suited for quickly mapping the boundary between malignant and normal tissue during an operation. 

Presently the spectroscopy is being carried out in the optics laboratory using a large, cumbersome 

and expensive setup [4]; however, every component could be miniaturized and our next goal is to 

construct  a  small,  portable  unit  that  can  be  used  directly  in  the  operating  theatre.  We  are  also 

working on the generalization of the technique to all forms of cancer.

The dynamical properties of an oscillating tip–cantilever system are now widely used in the ﬁeld of
scanning force microscopy. The aim of the present work is to get analytical expressions describing
the nonlinear dynamical properties of the oscillator in noncontact and intermittent contact situations
in the tapping mode. Three situations are investigated: the pure attractive interaction, the pure
repulsive interaction, and a mixing of the two. The analytical solutions obtained allow general trends
to be extracted: the noncontact and the intermittent contact show a very discriminate variation of the
phase. Therefore the measurement of the phase becomes a simple way to identify whether or not the
tip touches the surface during the oscillating period. It is also found that the key parameter
governing the structure of the dynamical properties is the product of the quality factor by a reduced
stiffness. In the attractive regime, the reduced stiffness is the ratio of an attractive effective stiffness
and the cantilever one. In the repulsive regime, the reduced stiffness is the ratio between the contact
stiffness and the cantilever one. The quality factor plays an important role. For large values of the
quality factor; it is predicted that a pure topography can be obtained whatever the value of the
contact stiffness. For a smaller quality factor, the oscillator becomes more sensitive to change of the
local mechanical properties. As a direct consequence, varying the quality factor, for example with
a vacuum chamber, would be a very interesting way to investigate soft materials either to access
topographic information or nanomechanical properties.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent developments in the ﬁeld of scanning force mi-
croscopy (cid:126)SFM(cid:33) are focused on the behavior of the dynami-
system
cal properties of an oscillating tip–cantilever
(cid:126)OTCL(cid:33). Experimentally, the use of the OTCL to probe sur-
face properties at the local scale, from the nanometer to a
few picometers, is done with two different operating modes.
One mode keeps the oscillating amplitude constant, and
the measured quantities are shift in resonance frequency as a
function of the tip–surface distance. In this case, recording
image is obtained by moving up and down the surface in
order to keep a chosen frequency shift constant. These ex-
periments are performed without any contact between the tip
and the sample; thus frequency shifts are a measure of the
attractive force between the tip and the surface. Spectacular
experimental results have shown that images giving a con-
trast at a few ten picometers can be achieved.1–5 Companion
theoretical developments suggest that the high sensitivity of
this mode is due to the nonlinear dynamical properties of the
OTCL at the proximity of the surface.6–8 Recent experimen-
tal results show variations of the image as a function of the
chosen frequency shift.4 Here again, it does appear that the
images obtained depend of several factors, among them the
OTCL properties and the ﬁne structure of the tip. There re-
mains a quite long way to completely understand the image
obtained, a general and well-known problem in the ﬁeld of
the local probe method.

With the second mode, a drive frequency is chosen. The

a(cid:33)Electronic mail: jpaime@cribx1.u-bordeaux.fr

feedback loop is used to maintain constant the amplitude of
the OTCL. The recorded images are the vertical displace-
ments needed to keep the amplitude constant and the corre-
sponding phase of the OTCL. This mode, commonly called
tapping, is often used in intermittent contact (cid:126)IC(cid:33), that is,
during a part of the oscillating period the tip touches the
surface but images can also be recorded without any contact.
This mode had been conceived mainly to reduce the shear
forces at the interface between the tip and the surface. So that
a new area is open in which soft materials, polymers, and
biological systems can be investigated without producing
signiﬁcant damages. Numerous experimental results have
shown the ability of this mode to image soft materials.9–12
Among them, phase contrast inversion as a function of the
set point and images of triblock copolymers are quite con-
vincing of the great potentiality of this mode. But here again,
recording a true topography is far to be achieved; more cor-
rectly one may discuss in terms of nanomechanical proper-
ties of the sample probed by this mode.12–16 Several theoret-
ical approaches have been dedicated to the tapping, part of
them being numerical simulations.14,17–21 The major draw-
back of numerical simulations is the difﬁculty to give general
routes and simple predictions to understand and deﬁne ex-
perimental strategies.

The present work is an attempt to extract analytical ex-
pressions describing the tapping mode. As shown in preced-
ing papers,7,19 the nonlinear dynamics of the OTCL in an
attractive ﬁeld is quite complicated and indeed do show a

the tip is brought into contact to the sample. Therefore very
simple hypotheses are used in order to extract analytical so-
lutions giving the essential trends of the OTCL response.

The paper is organized as follows: the theoretical part is
divided in two sections. The attractive regime is presented in
Sec. II. The phase and amplitude variations as a function of
the OTCL-surface distance are shown for a drive frequency
slightly below the resonance frequency. In Sec. III, the IC
case is ﬁrst discussed with a simple repulsive harmonic po-
tential, then an attractive interaction is added. Section IV is
dedicated to a brief discussion and a few experimental results
are given. In Appendix A and B are given a detailed techni-
cal description of the theoretical approach and of the experi-
mental conditions, respectively.

II. ATTRACTIVE REGIME

In a tapping experiment, a tip–microlever system is kept
vibrating at a drive frequency (cid:118)near a surface. Recording of
the phase and vertical displacements of the piezoelectric ce-
ramic holding the sample are made thanks to a feedback loop
keeping the amplitude constant. To understand the origin of
the image contrast, one must understand changes of the am-
plitude and phase, A(D) and (cid:119)(D), respectively, as func-
tions of the OTCL-surface distance D. Recording A(D) and
(cid:119)(D) is achieved by making approach–retract curves. The
scan is stopped at a given location (X;Y ) in the horizontal
plane of the sample, then a periodic motion along the vertical
Z-axis
series of
approach–retract curves are obtained providing information
on the properties of the dynamical behavior of the OTCL as
a function of D and properties of the sample at the local
scale. The ultimate goal is to extract the sample properties
from variations of A(D) and (cid:119)(D).

In these experiments,

is performed.

The attractive interaction between the tip and the sample
is assumed to be a sphere–plane interaction involving the
disperse part of the van der Waals interaction (cid:64)see Eq. (cid:126)5(cid:33)(cid:35).
For distances from the surface above a few nanometers, the
attractive force is negligible and a forced, damped oscillator
satisfactorily describes the OTCL. The differential equation
describing the harmonic behavior, i.e., amplitude and phase
relationships with the frequency, is given by:

Equations (cid:126)7a(cid:33) and (cid:126)7b(cid:33) give two physical branches for
the amplitude and the phase (cid:126)see Appendix A(cid:33). For drive
frequencies slightly below the resonance one amplitude and
phase exhibit a hysteresis cycle that disappears as the mag-
a increases (cid:64)see Figs. 1(cid:126)a(cid:33), 1(cid:126)b(cid:33), and 2(cid:126)a(cid:33), 2(cid:126)b(cid:33)(cid:35).

During an approach–retract curve, the oscillator experi-
ences both a pure attractive and an attractive–repulsive ﬁeld.
A van der Waals attractive ﬁeld leads to a nonlinear dynamic
behavior of the OTCL and can generate a hysteresis cycle in
the approach–retract curve.16–19 An approach based on a
variational principle had shown that analytical expressions
could be derived describing the nonlinear behavior of the
OTCL.19

The aim of parts II and III is to develop the analytical
model with a more precise description of the noncontact
(cid:126)NC(cid:33) and IC situations including phase variations during an

ing numerical results. The numerical simulation solves the
following differential equation based on Eq. (cid:126)1(cid:33) plus the in-
teracting term, x¨ (t)(cid:49)((cid:118)

(cid:50)HR/6m(D(cid:50)x(t)) 2, with a Runge–Kutta 4 method from
arbitrary initial conditions. We assume that the oscillator is
in its harmonic state for each step of the implementation.
This is validated by an adiabatic criterion, which evaluates
the number of points for the whole calculus for a given value
of the quality factor. Amplitude and phase variations are then
calculated thanks to a numerical synchronic detection ﬁlter-
ing the ﬁrst harmonic, n(cid:53)1. To verify that the use of the
harmonic solution was efﬁcient to describe the nonlinear be-
havior, thus validate the analytical model, several numerical
simulations were done with a synchronic detection ﬁltering
the second harmonic, n(cid:53)2. We found that the amplitude
variations were less than 0.3% of the ones for n(cid:53)1. For the
smaller Q(cid:107)
a value (cid:64)Figs. 1(cid:126)a(cid:33), 1(cid:126)b(cid:33)(cid:35), letters illustrate the hys-
teresis cycle and the bistable behavior of the OTCL. When
bifurcation occurs during the approach (cid:126)retract(cid:33), point B (cid:126)E(cid:33),
the numerical solution jumps to its stable upper (cid:126)lower(cid:33)
branch in amplitude, point C (cid:126)F(cid:33), instead of following the
unstable branch BE.

Then, since d decreases, the strength of the attractive
ﬁeld increases, from which an increase of the amplitude is
expected. The reduction of the amplitude predicted, and
observed,16,19 is a nonintuitive result (cid:126)C to D(cid:33). The reduction
of the amplitude is due to change of the phase relationship
between the OTCL and the excitation, the phase getting a
value below (cid:50)90° (cid:64)Fig. 1(cid:126)b(cid:33) from C to D(cid:35). Thus, the attrac-
tive interaction acts as a repulsive one, leading to a decrease
of the amplitude.19

The whole variation of the phase, phase jump, and cycle
of hysteresis (cid:64)Fig. 1(cid:126)b(cid:33)(cid:35), is similar to the one of the ampli-
tude (cid:64)Fig. 1(cid:126)a(cid:33)(cid:35). For a small value of Q(cid:107)
a , the phase jumps
below (cid:50)90° and an hysteresis cycle follows. For a large Q(cid:107)
a
value (cid:64)Figs. 2(cid:126)a(cid:33), 2(cid:126)b(cid:33)(cid:35), the phase crosses the value of (cid:50)90°
continuously and the approach and retract curves are identi-
cal. Measurement of the phase is very useful to identify NC
situations. As discussed below, as soon as the phase is less
than (cid:50)90°, the attractive regime is dominant.

At this stage, it is worth discussing in more detail the
physical origin of the variation of the phase. Within the lin-
ear response theory, the instantaneous dissipated power is a
function of the phase value through a sin function. When a
nonlinear dynamical behavior occurs, the variation of the
phase is not uniquely related to the dissipation but also to the
distortion of the resonance peak.

As shown with the introduction of the dimensionless pa-
(cid:64)Eqs. (cid:126)7(cid:33)(cid:35), contrary to a linear behavior, the forc-
rameter (cid:107)
a
ing term cannot be scaled out. The magnitude of the drive
amplitude becomes a new operative parameter as much as
the strength of the nonlinear coupling term. At ﬁxed drive
frequency and ﬁxed drive amplitude, when the OTCL ap-
proaches the surface,
the oscillating amplitude and the
strength of the nonlinear coupling term vary. As a conse-
quence, a phase variation is expected without involving a
particular change of the dissipating process. In the present
case, uniquely the attractive ﬁeld is involved. From Eqs. (cid:126)7(cid:33)
we derived the equation giving the shape of the resonance
peak as a function of the OTCL-surface distance, d:

Here we focus on the variations of the phase when a
drive frequency is slightly below the resonance one. The case
of a drive frequency at the resonance one or above gives a
simpler structure and can be straightforwardly deduced. In
Figs. 3(cid:126)a(cid:33) and 3(cid:126)b(cid:33) are given the evolutions of the resonance
peak as a function of d and the corresponding phase varia-
tions when the OTCL moves towards the surface. At dis-
tances d large enough, say a few nanometers, the peak keeps
its resonance shape and the phase remains roughly constant
(cid:64)domain (cid:126)a(cid:33)(cid:35). When the peak starts to distort and the location
of u crosses the bifurcation point, the phase jumps to the
lower branch (cid:64)domain (cid:126)b(cid:33)(cid:35). At a closer distance, the peak
further distorts and the phase goes towards the (cid:50)180° value
(cid:64)domain (cid:126)c(cid:33)(cid:35). Therefore, the phase variation provides a pre-
cise information about the stationary state of the OTCL. This
statement is particularly veriﬁed when IC situations take
place.

III. INTERMITTENT CONTACT (cid:132)IC(cid:133) REGIME

A. Pure repulsive ﬁeld

The IC situation is given by a(cid:46)d. In a ﬁrst step, the
attractive interaction is considered as being negligible (H
(cid:53)0). The repulsive ﬁeld acts during a short part of the
OTCL period, typically a hundredth of the period. Thus the
(cid:53)0 and t f
action is deﬁned between the two instants t i
(cid:53)(cid:64)arccos(D/A)(cid:35)/(cid:118). In order to get an analytical expression,
the repulsive interaction is assumed to have a simple har-
monic form: (1/2)k s(x(t)(cid:50)D) 2, where k s
is the contact
(cid:102), with (cid:102) the diameter of the
stiffness scaling as k s
contact area involved in the IC situations and G s
the
Young’s modulus of the sample.25,26 For small indentations,
(a(cid:50)d)/a(cid:33)1, the variational principle gives the couple of
equations:

There is one physical branch of solutions in amplitude and in

a .

The slope of the variation of the amplitude with d,s(a)
(cid:53)(cid:100)a/(cid:100)d, of an approach–retract curve is a fundamental pa-
rameter. Firstly, the slope contains information about the na-
nomechanical properties of the sample. Secondly, the slope
at a given setpoint, that is at a given amplitude reduction at
which an image is recorded, controls the vertical displace-
ment of the piezoelectric actuator. Equation (cid:126)10a(cid:33) predicts a
slope function of the Q(cid:107)

(cid:126)10a(cid:33) predicts that even for soft materials, a large Q value
could give a true topography of the surface, s(a)(cid:53)1, without

Unfortunately, because of the diverging behavior of the

it is difﬁcult to obtain a simple,

Here again, a unique physical branch of solution is given by
Eqs. (cid:126)15(cid:33) (cid:126)see Appendix A(cid:33). As for the pure repulsive case,
Eq. (cid:126)15a(cid:33) predicts a (Q(cid:107)
s) 2/3 dependence, but the relative
importance of this parameter now becomes dependent of the
s). While for small amplitudes (cid:126)large (cid:107)
magnitude of (Q(cid:107)
a)
the slope is a complex function of (cid:107)
s , for large
amplitudes (cid:126)small (cid:107)
a), the OTCL becomes mostly sensitive
to a pure repulsive ﬁeld. Therefore, at large amplitudes, we
expect the experimental curves to be suitably described with
Eqs. (cid:126)10(cid:33).

a and (cid:107)

A typical IC approach–retract curve requires to combine
the solutions given by Eqs. (cid:126)15(cid:33) with the analytical results
obtained with uniquely a pure attractive ﬁeld (cid:64)Eqs. (cid:126)7a(cid:33) and
(cid:126)7b(cid:33)(cid:35). Theoretically, the equation of the surface is d(cid:53)a,
while a more realistic description preventing the diverging

behavior uses d(cid:53)a(cid:49)d˜
c . A direct consequence is that
branches of solution d A(cid:49)(d A(cid:50)) obtained with a pure attrac-
tive ﬁeld might in fact touch the surface.

IV. DISCUSSION

Because of the nonlinear behavior of the OTCL and of
the mixing of IC and NC stationary states, complex situa-
tions can happen as those shown in Fig. 7(cid:126)b(cid:33). But, while
some of them will not be easy to observe experimentally,
others, theoretically forbidden, will occur because of tip (cid:126)or
surface(cid:33) pollution. In the present part are given some typical
results, showing that the observed variations of the phase
allow the IC and NC situations to be easily discriminated.
Also some unpredicted situations are presented. Finally, we
brieﬂy discuss two points that have not been analytically
solved. One is the case of dissipating samples, a rather im-
portant point for soft materials, the second concerns numeri-
cal results in which are included the Hertz model to describe
the IC state.

The experimental results shown in Figs. 8 and 9 were
performed in a glove box on silica surfaces and polystyrene
(cid:53)200 000. The silica
polymer ﬁlms of molecular weight M W
surfaces were prepared as described in Ref. 28. Both silica
and polymer surfaces can be considered as hard surfaces, the
polymer ﬁlm for high molecular weights being mechanically
inert under the action of the oscillating tip in the attractive
regime.16 In the glove box, the p.p.m. of water is achieved so
that capillary forces are negligible (cid:126)see also Appendix B(cid:33).

state. The NC state is observed for values equal or below A 0
(cid:53)2.8 nm). For such a low value of the amplitude, the instability has disap-
peared and the variation of the phase resembles the theoretical one given in
Fig. 2(cid:126)b(cid:33).

The general trend predicted by Eqs. (cid:126)15(cid:33) is in good
agreement with the one measured. The relative importance of
the dimensionless parameter Q(cid:107)
a can be checked by varying
the drive amplitude,19 thus A 0 , or using a large tip radius (cid:126)or
a crashed tip(cid:33), a larger HR product. With a crashed tip, a
pure attractive regime shown by the variation of the phase
occurs at a A 0 value as high as 30 nm (cid:126)Fig. 8(cid:33). For NC
stationary states exhibiting a bifurcation, as soon as the
OTCL had crossed the bifurcation point, the phase varies
slowly and its variation is practically independent of the A 0

IC branch is reached (cid:126)point I(cid:33). Such a jump is not predicted. Here is in-
volved a possible pollution of the tip and/or of the surface (cid:126)see text(cid:33).

With a second OTCL,

the pure attractive regime
(cid:53)4 nm,)
(cid:126)below A 0
uniquely occurs for small values of A 0
from which is deduced that the tip is much smaller (cid:126)Fig. 9(cid:33).
For such a small tip radius, a bifurcation structure is more
difﬁcult to observe and the phase crosses almost continu-
ously the (cid:50)90° value (cid:64)as shown theoretically, Fig. 2(cid:126)b(cid:33)(cid:35).

The situations showing a jump from an IC branch to a
NC one during the retraction of the surface (cid:64)path E3F3G3H3,
Fig. 7(cid:126)b(cid:33)(cid:35) were not experimentally encountered. The reason
is probably that this type of jump occurs at a spot close to the
one corresponding to the usual instability jumping back to
the free values of the phase and amplitude. Nevertheless,
bifurcation structures resembling those can be found for soft

materials. In that case, the bifurcation is due to the growth of
a viscoelastic nanoprotuberance under the action of the at-
tractive ﬁeld of the OTCL.16

It’s far beyond the scope of the present work to discuss
in detail such a behavior. Moreover, the study of polymer
ﬁlms made of tribloc that exhibit a regular structure at the
mesoscopic scale with different mechanical responses10,11,12
is more suitable. As a matter of fact such a material, and in
general the mixing of hard and soft materials, exhibit a wide
variety of situations that requires a speciﬁc analysis.14,15

The latter example concerns the study of a mica surface
in the glove box with a rather large tip (cid:126)Figs. 10 and 11(cid:33). The
structure observed is reminiscent of the fourth case given in
Fig. 7(cid:126)b(cid:33) (cid:126)path B4C4E4F4). At a very large drive amplitude,
(cid:53)41 nm, the usual variations of the IC state are observed
A 0
(cid:126)Fig. 10(cid:33). At a slightly lower one, A 0
(cid:53)32 nm, the OTCL
follows the NC branch then suddenly jumps to the IC branch
to reach the value (cid:119)(cid:53)(cid:50)90°. During the retract, the OTCL
follows the IC branch until (cid:119)(cid:53)(cid:50)90° is reached, then jumps
down to the NC branch (cid:126)Fig. 11(cid:33). This situation corresponds
to the fourth case for which the NC branch is the stable one
and the IC state should normally not be reached (cid:64)Fig. 7(cid:126)b(cid:33)(cid:35).
In other words, experimental results similar to the ones
(cid:53)30 and 20 nm(cid:33), where uniquely the NC
shown in Fig. 8 (A 0
branch is available, should be observed.

To explain the observed IC state, the most reasonable
hypothesis is the occurrence of pollution either on the tip or
on the surface that allows an IC situation to happen quench-
ing the OTCL in the IC state. This can be explained with the
fact that the average attractive ﬁeld between the OTCL and
the surface varies as 1/(cid:65)A. 16 Therefore when the amplitude
decreases, the attractive ﬁeld increases so that materials can
be pumped, and creates IC situations.

Not included in the above analysis is the inﬂuence of an
additional dissipation when an IC state takes place. As stated
above, great care must be taken to discuss phase variation as
the result of a dissipating process. In any case, the introduc-
tion of an additional dissipation will make almost impossible
the search for an analytical solution without the use of as-
sumptions making the whole attempt questionable. Numeri-
cal simulations can help to identify the role of dissipation.
Qualitatively some information can be used12,13,14 but even
in that case, the phenomenological approach does not give a
clear meaning of what is really occurring. The additional

dissipation can be issue of the bulk viscoelastic properties of
the sample, requiring that the volume involved is at least of
the cubic micrometer.29 Such a huge volume is certainly not
involved in IC situations. If the dissipate process occurs at
the interface between the tip and the surface, there is no
simple analytical solutions and the description of the dissi-
pating process remains quite complicated even in the case of
the static deﬂection mode.27

Finally, a question arises about the validity of the simple
harmonic model employed to describe the repulsive ﬁeld. A
somewhat more complicated approach is to introduce the
Hertz model, which gives a nonlinear dependence between
the indentation depth and the elastic force.25 The Hertz
model describes an elastic contact between the tip and the
sample and provides an evaluation of the contact stiffness as
a function of the indentation depth. The introduction of the
Hertz model doesn’t lead to a simple analytical solution.14
The results presented above are preserved, structure of the
bifurcation, discrimination between the IC and NC states,
and the main difference concerns the slope dependence as a
function of the contact stiffness. The exponents found are
slightly above the ones obtained with the harmonic approxi-
mation (cid:126)Table I and Fig. 12(cid:33).

Note that for reasonable values of (cid:107)

a , numerical and
analytical results give a power law close to 2/3. A simple
analysis of Eq. (cid:126)15a(cid:33) indicates that with large amplitudes, the
inﬂuence of the attractive ﬁeld is reduced as (cid:107)
a goes asymp-
totically to zero, thus allowing the slope to have a simplest
form as the one given in Eq. (cid:126)11(cid:33). Therefore, with a high
amplitude it becomes easier to access the local mechanical
properties more quantitatively. The other point is the impor-
tant role of the quality factor Q. As shown with Eq. (cid:126)11(cid:33) and
Eq. (cid:126)15a(cid:33), the higher the quality factor, the larger the product
Q(cid:107)
s . Therefore to be very sensitive with an OTCL to access
at the nanomechanical properties of the sample requires a
low Q factor, while to access the topographic structure re-
quires a high Q factor and a high amplitude. The unique way
to check the validity of these equations is to use a vacuum
chamber in which the magnitude of the quality factor can be
varied.

V. CONCLUSION

The aim of the present work was to extract analytical
expressions describing the nonlinear behavior of an OTCL in

the tapping mode. Three situations are considered: the pure
attractive interaction, the pure repulsive interaction, and a
mixing of the two. The analytical solutions give the variation
of the amplitude and of the phase as a function of the OTCL-
surface distance. The general evolutions predicted are in
good agreement with the observed ones. The NC and IC
stationary states can be discriminated by recording the varia-
tion of the phase. The bifurcation from a monostable to a
bistable state is identiﬁed in the pure attractive regime. In the
intermediate regime, because of the nonlinear behavior of the
OTCL and the mixing of IC and NC stationary states, the
structures of the bifurcation are more complex. Experimen-
tally, it is easy to discriminate between the different situa-
tions by varying the magnitude of the drive amplitude. The
contribution of the attractive force can be signiﬁcantly re-
duced through the increase of the drive amplitude leading to
an almost pure repulsive case, while a NC stationary state
becomes dominant at small drive amplitudes. The quality
factor Q is shown to be a key parameter. For large values of
Q and large amplitudes a true topography is expected, while
with a smaller value of Q, the OTCL becomes more sensitive
to the local mechanical properties of the surface. Therefore,
it does appear interesting to perform experiments on soft
materials in a vacuum chamber in order to vary the quality
factor.

where L is the Lagrangian of the system. The aim of the use
of a variational principle is to employ a trial function x(t)
allowing us to perform an analytical treatment. According to
the fact that the oscillator essentially exhibits a harmonic
behavior, the trial function used has the harmonic stationary
form of Eq. (cid:126)2(cid:33), and therefore the action is deﬁned on one
oscillating period. The Lagrangian of the OTCL is deﬁned

relationship: cos((cid:119))(cid:53)(cid:54)(cid:65)1(cid:50)sin2((cid:119)). Those two branches are
deﬁned for every set of parameters and therefore both have

Eq. (cid:126)10a(cid:33) implies to choose cos((cid:119))(cid:53)(cid:49)(cid:65)1(cid:50)sin2((cid:119)),
thus
leading to only one physical branch.

used, and a physical surface given by d(cid:53)a(cid:49)d˜

(cid:126)see text(cid:33). The calculations ﬁnally lead to the couple of equa-

APPENDIX B: EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS

The experimental approach–retract curves were mea-
sured with the tapping mode of a Nanoscope III from Digital

FIG. B1. Resonance curve with ﬁt corresponding to Eq. (cid:126)4a(cid:33).

Instruments (cid:126)Santa Barbara, CA(cid:33). The cantilevers (cid:126)Nano-
probe(cid:33) have a typical resonance frequency around 300 kHz
and a quality factor between 250 and 550 (cid:126)see Table B1(cid:33).

Two piezoactuators are needed to perform experiments
with the tapping mode: one allowing the microlever to vi-
brate at a given drive frequency with a given drive ampli-
tude, and a second piezo to move the sample. During an
approach–retract curve,
the second piezo displaces the
sample along the Z-axis while the other keeps constant the
drive frequency and the drive amplitude.

1. Technical remarks: preparation of the experiment

The resonance frequency and the quality factor are ex-
tracted from measurements of the resonance peak (cid:126)Cantilever
Tune mode on the NIII(cid:33). Recording of the resonance peaks
are made at distances from the surface between 500 nm and
1 (cid:109)m. For distances above 10 (cid:109)m, it has been shown that
parameters of the OTCL vary.12,30 Change of the resonance
amplitude and frequency had been attributed to the decrease
of the thickness of a layer of air between the OTCL and the
surface. The OTCL properties become stable as soon as the
distance between the OTCL and the surface is around or
smaller than one micrometer.

The quality factor Q is measured at A(cid:53)A 0 /& (cid:126)at a
(cid:53)1/&(cid:53)0.707 with the reduced coordinates(cid:33). For large val-
ues of Q, the quality factor is given by Q(cid:53)(cid:110)
0 /(cid:68)(cid:110), with (cid:68)(cid:110)
the frequency width at this amplitude. Using the reduced
coordinates, a resonance curve is presented in Fig. B1 with
the corresponding ﬁt (cid:64)Eq. (cid:126)4a(cid:33)(cid:35). In many cases the resonance
curves may exhibit an asymmetric shape and several bumps
in the curve tails. Practically, the undesirable bumps can be
resumed by clearing the lodgment of the cantilever and mov-
ing the cantilever inside its lodgment.
At the very beginning, the resonance peak is often asymmet-
ric. Typically, after three hours the asymmetry has almost
completely disappeared and the resonance peak recovers a
Lorentzian shape. As such a kinetic effect was observed, it
might be due to a thermal equilibration of the OTCL under
the action of the laser beam focalized at its upper extremity.

At a distance of 10 to 20 nm from the surface, dispersion

free(cid:38)(cid:54)3°. For the
function of the drive amplitude: (cid:119)
sake of clarity, the phase reported in the ﬁgures were all set
at the average value.

Finally, the location of the surface being not known, the
offset of the x-axis is set arbitrarily. When several curves are
compared, the offset values were calculated in order to have
the ﬁrst instability of the amplitude and of the phase at the
same x location.

After a few hours, the resonance curve becomes stable and
the OTCL properties do not evolve. The OTCL for which it
is impossible to extract a harmonic behavior (cid:126)several oscil-
lating modes, large asymmetry remaining(cid:33) are rejected.

Once the OTCL had reached the thermal equilibrium
with the laser beam, the stability of the whole system and the
reproducibility of the experiments were excellent. Only drifts
of the resonance frequency of around a few tens hertz were
observed over a period of several weeks. This is particularly
true in the glove box, while in-air variations of the resonance
frequency and quality factor were observed over several
days, those variations being probably due to change of the
ambient conditions.

A drift of a few tens hertz does not alter the approach–
retract curves. Several identical measurements were done
time-to-time showing an identical variation of the amplitude
and the phase as a function of the OTCL surface distance.
When it occurs, the main change is due to a variation of the
tip apex when very soft materials are investigated, meaning
that some polymer had coated the tip.

2. Data treatment

At a given drive amplitude the used amplitude is chosen
(cid:53)0.707 A 0 . The cor-
with the cantilever tune such that A free
responding phase data were typically between (cid:50)30° and
(cid:50)40° (cid:126)To make the phase varying between 0° and (cid:50)180°,
subtraction of the recorded data of (cid:50)90° was done(cid:33). Disper-
sion of the values of the phase is partly due to the accuracy
to set the magnitude of A free , and the way the phase offset is
ﬁxed with the cantilever tune.

The calibration of the amplitude is achieved by making
series of approach–retract curves with different drive ampli-
tudes on a hard surface chosen as a reference (cid:126)usually a silica
surface(cid:33). The hard surface makes the slope of the IC equal to
1. Therefore the variation of the amplitude is easily linked to
the vertical displacements. Another way is to record the
variation of the offset of the vertical location of the surface
as a function of the drive amplitude. Nevertheless, for the
small drive amplitudes, the linear relationship fails and the
accuracy is not as good for A free below 3 to 4 nm.

The experimental approach–retract curves were per-
formed in a gloves box in which the p.p.m. in water was
achieved so that capillary forces are negligible. Three differ-
ent microlevers have been used called OTCL1, OTCL2,
OTCL3. The parameters and the samples investigated are
given in Table B1.

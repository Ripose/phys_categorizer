High  performance  microwave  gyroscope  (MG)  is  theoretically  developed for the first time to our knowledge. 
MG is based on Sagnac effect in microwave ring resonator (RR), where a specially tailored phase shifter (PS) on 
the basis of surface acoustic waves is inserted. Due to that the beat frequency becomes proportional to square (or 
cubic) root upon rotation rate, and therefore hugely increases. In the result MG has few order higher sensitivity 
and dynamic range, than state-of-the-art laser gyros, so it can serve as an advanced rotation sensor in navigation, 
and fundamental sciences. 
 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Since  the  advent  of  laser  three  main  types  of  optical  rotation  sensors  have  been  under 
development.  These  include  ring  laser  gyroscope  (RLG),  ring  resonator  gyroscope  (RRG), 
and fiber optics gyroscope (FOG) [1-3]. State-of-the-art RLG is now the most sensitive device 
among  them  [4,5]  and  is  used  extensively  in  inertial  navigation  systems  for  aircraft,  and  in 
fundamental  physics  and  geophysics  [6].  All  types  of  gyros  are  based  on  Sagnac  effect, 
discovered  in  1913  [7].  In  Sagnac  interferometer  two  light  beams  propagate  in  opposite 
directions  around  a  common  path.  Rotating  interferometer  effectively  shortens  the  optical 
path traveled by one of the beams, while lengthening the other on the same value d L, given by 
.                                                                  (1) 
Here S -is the area enclosed by that path, v -is the speed of light there, W
 -is rotation angular 
frequency. In the case of FOG this change of path length causes phase difference between two 
counter  propagating  beams  (having  the  same  frequency),  which  is  detected  by  interfering 
them outside the path. However in RLG and RRG light propagates in RR so change of optical 
path length causes the change of RR resonant frequency. Thus, counter propagating beams in 
RR  have  different  frequencies,  and  produce  the  beat  frequency  2d f,  which  is  direct 
proportional to change of path length

where f – is frequency of light. 
As it is seen from (2) beat frequency is direct proportional also to operating frequency, so a 
microwave  gyroscope  with  operating  frequency  around  1  GHz  will  have  about  on  5  orders 
lower beat frequency, and therefore sensitivity than RLG with the same dimensions. Because 
of that till now microwave gyros have not been considering as a possible rotation sensors at 
all.  Now  we  use  a  novel  method,  called  the  method  of  phase  shifting  enabling  to  increase 
considerably  the  beat  frequency  in  rotating  RR.  Due  to  that  a  possibility  of  creating  an 
advanced rotation sensor with very high performance - microwave gyroscope arises.

2. PRINCIPAL EXPRESSIONS 

Let us consider a microwave RR, with perimeter L. Its resonant frequencies f0 are determined 
from the condition that path length is multiple to the wavelength, or that along that path the 
phase of microwaves is changed on an integer 2p

, i.e. 

mv/Lf0

=

 ,                                                                       (3) 

where m – is an integer. 
Suppose  that  a  frequency  dependent  PS,  which  adds  the  phase  j( f)  to  the  waves  with 
frequency f is inserted into RR. Then the resonant frequencies f1 of that RR satisfy to another 
condition 

.                                                                (4) 
When RR is rotated path length of waves are changed on a small value D L, which causes the 
shift D f of resonant frequency, determined from the equation

Let us assume that j( f) is a quadratic function in vicinity of point f=f1. Then j( f1+D f) can be 
expressed as an expansion in Taylor series with 3 terms:

This square equation determines the shift of RR resonant frequency stipulated by the shift of 
its length. The solutions of (7) is written as 

(

where  A=2p( L+D L)/v+j
Analyzing (8) one can conclude that shift of RR resonant frequency is sharply increased when 
 -2p L/v, becoming proportional to square root of D L (see Fig.1, and Fig.2). By this it is 
necessary  that D L  and j
L>0  then  (8)  gives  imaginary 
value  of  D f,  which  indicates  on  the  absence  of  oscillations  in  RR.  Therefore  in  rotating  RR 
with PS one of counter propagating waves is disappeared, but another one is splitted on two 
waves  propagating  in  the  same  directions.  Below  we will assume that condition j
L< 0 is 
satisfied.  Thus  appropriately  installed  negative  value  of  PFD  can  strongly  change  the 
functional  dependence  between  D f  and  D L,  considerably  increasing  D f.  The  range  of  PFD, 
where it takes place is determined from (8) by taking into account the condition A2<<f1j

that  produce  the  beat  frequency  2D f,  considerably  surpassing  the  beat  frequency  (2)  in  RR 
without PS, because of its proportionality to square root upon rotation rate. By analogy a PS

Contrary  to  previous  case,  both  of  counter-propagating  waves  exist  here.  One  of  them  has 
positive shift of resonant frequency, another one- negative. Beat frequency produced by them 
is however higher than that in previous case because of its proportionality to cubic root upon 
rotation rate. 
Required  PS  can  be  designed  on  the  basis  of  surface  acoustic  waves  (SAW)  delay  lines  [8] 
(with bi-directional amplifier to compensate the losses). Since SAW wavelength l
 is around a 
micron the change s in path traveled by SAW for example on 0.1 mm causes the phase shift 
~ s/l
100.  To  obtain  required  by  (9)  value  of  PFD  it  is  necessary  that  this  phase  shift  took 
place  in  frequency  interval  D f~ (v/L)(s/l ).  Thus  required  PFD  can  be  obtained  by  tailoring 
appropriate chirp low of SAW transducers. Following this approach we designed a PS on the 
basis  of  SAW  chirped  delay  line.  Its  transducers  have  both  linear  and  quadratic  chirp, 
providing the quadratic function j (f) in vicinity of resonant frequency 600 MHz, having j
¢=  
- 0.09424 1/MHz, and j

¢= 0.0001 1/MHz2. 

Let  us compare the performances of proposed MG and optical gyros. Numerical evaluations 
of (10) by substituting L=3 m, v=2(cid:215) 108 m/s, j
¢= 0.0001 1/MHz2, f1=600 MHz is presented on 
Fig. 3 by solid line. The beat frequency in conventional MG without PS, determined from (2)

same  dimensions.  It  is  seen  that  after  inserting  of  PS,  the  beat  frequency,  and  therefore 
sensitivity  of  MG  increases  on  7…9  order,  and  surpasses  by  this  a  few  order  the  beat 
frequency  in  RLG.  Dynamic  range  of  MG  also  is  much  larger  than  that  of  RLG,  because 
change of rotation rate in region for example 1010 causes the change of beat frequency only in 
region  105.  Therefore  proposed  MG  is  an  advanced  rotation  sensor,  that  being  created  can 
replace  existing  RLG  and  FOG  in  inertial  navigation  systems  because  of  its  higher 
performance, and possible lower cost. Another application of MG can be monitoring of Earth 
rotation. As it follows from (10) Earth rotation angular velocity 15 grad/hour causes the beat 
frequency of MG (Earth Sagnac frequency) about 800 Hz, meanwhile the world largest laser 
gyros  –  Canterbury  C-2  produces  Earth  Sagnac  frequency  only  79  Hz  [9].  Moreover,  beat 
frequency  800  Hz  can  be  increased  further  by  increasing  of  MG  dimensions,  and  operating 
frequency.  Thus  MG  can  be  used  also  in  geophysics  for  monitoring  Earth  rotation  angular 
velocity with very high precision. 

4. CONCLUSIONS 

In  conclusion  we  proposed  an  advanced  rotation  sensor  -  MG,  where  appropriately  tailored 
SAW  chirped  delay  line  is  inserted.  Due  to  that  beat  frequency  becomes  proportional  to 
square  (or  cubic)  root  upon  rotation  rate  so  is  hugely  increased,  surpassing  even  the  beat 
frequency  in  RLG  with  the  same  dimensions.  In  the  result  MG  has  higher  sensitivity  and 
dynamic range than state-of-the-art RLG. Being created proposed MG can be used in inertial 
navigation systems, and fundamental sciences.

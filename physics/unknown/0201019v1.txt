ABSTRACT 

Compression  of  an  adsorbed  polymer  layer  distorts  its  relaxed  structure.  
Surface force measurements from different laboratories show that the return to 
this  relaxed  structure  after  the  compression  is  released  can  be  slowed  to  the 
scale  of  tens  of  minutes  and  that  the  recovery  time  grows  rapidly  with 
molecular  weight.  We  argue  that  the  arrested  state  of  the  free  layer  before 
relaxation  can  be  described  as  a  Guiselin  brush  structure1,  in  which  the 
surface  excess  lies  at  heights  of  the  order  of  the  layer  thickness,  unlike  an 
adsorbed  layer.  This  brush  structure  predicts  an  exponential  falloff  of  the 
force  at  large  distance  with  a  decay  length  that  varies  as  the  initial 
compression distance to the 6/5 power. This exponential falloff is consistent 
with  surface  force  measurements.  We  propose  a  relaxation  mechanism  that 
accounts for the increase in relaxation time with chain length. 

I. Introduction  

Adsorbed polymer layers occur widely in surface phenomena and colloidal dispersions 2-

5.  In  recent  decades  it  has  become  possible  to  predict  and  to  measure  the  state  of 

polymers  in  these  layers  6-15.    Still,  many  aspects  of  these  layers  have  eluded 

understanding  -  especially  kinetic  aspects.  One  often  encounters  timescales  for 

equilibration  that  defy  explanation  in  terms  of  the  characteristic  relaxation  times  of 

polymers  in  solution.    In  this  study  we  examine  experiments,  in  two  different 

laboratories, where these slow relaxations were observed via surface force measurements 

1

 

 

 

 

16,17.  In  both  of  these  cases  strong,  long  range  forces  are  observed  upon  initial 

compression to a high volume fraction.  But when the surfaces are separated, the forces 

are much weaker and fall off faster with distance.  This compressed force profile persists 

for many minutes and it persists longer when longer polymers are used.  The compressed 

profile follows an exponential spatial decay of repulsive force over a substantial range of 

distances.

Both of these experiments considered polyethylene oxide (PEO) in a toluene solvent on a 

mica  surface  in  a  range  of  molecular  weights.  Qualitatively,  similar  behavior  was 

observed also with PEO in a 0.1M KNO3 aqueous solution 18. As the PEO / 0.1M KNO3 

solution  system  is  an  unusual  one  19  and  nonetheless  similar  behavior  was  observed  in 

both  solvents,  in  a  range  of  molecular  weights,  we  believe  that  such  slow  relaxation 

phenomena  occur  in  a  range  of  adsorbed  polymer  layers  that  have  been  compressed, 

despite the special character of this polymer.  In Section II we describe a form of surface 

constraint  that  accounts  plausibly  for  the  weakened  force  in  the  compressed  layer.    We 

then describe the brushlike (cid:147)mat" structure of the layer when the compression is released.  

We  infer  the  force  profile  to  be  expected  from  this  new  structure  at  short  and  at  long

distances.    In  Section  III  we  compare  our  predictions  with  the  force  measurements in  a 

surface force balance (SFB). The power law predicted at small separations is consistent 

with the  data in that region. At larger distances an exponential falloff is predicted. This 

agrees  well  with  the  experiments,  and  the  observed  decay  length  agrees  well  with  the 

predicted  one  arising  from  the  mat  structure.  We  also  compare  the  observed  transition 

distance  between  weak  and  strong  compression  regimes  with the predicted thickness of 

the  mat  structure  and  find  satisfactory  agreement.    In  the  discussion  section  which 

follows,  we  suggest  a  relaxation  mechanism  that  could  account  for  the  increase  in 

relaxation time with molecular weight. We comment on the implications of the mat state 

for  possible  applications  and  suggest  further  experiments  to  investigate  the  mat  state 

more stringently. 

II.  Proposed constrained state of a compressed polymer layer 

The  absorbed  polymer  layer  present  before  compression  is  strongly  concentrated  near 

each surface  1,12,15,20-22, so that typically, a significant fraction (of order 10-20%) of the 

surface  is  covered  with  monomers.    As  two  surfaces  are  brought  together,  the  surface 

concentration  increases  as  further  monomers  from  each  polymer  layer  are  pushed  onto 

the surface.  In some cases these high concentrations may decrease the monomer mobility 

markedly  23,24.    Since  our  experiments  show  very  slow  recovery  to  the  initial  state,  we 

infer  that  they  suffer  this  decreased  mobility  at  the  surface.    Nevertheless,  part  of  the 

recovery  is  immediate:  the  compressed  layers  are  able  to  expand  to  several  times  their 

compressed  size  with  no  observed  time  lag  16,18,  as  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  on 

3

 

 

 

 

separations the measured intersurface forces remain repulsive at all separations Dmax > D 

> 2h0, where 2h0 is the value of D at closest approach and Dmax is the value of D when 

normal steric forces vanish. This behavior leads us to infer that the monomers away from 

the surface are not immobilized.   

These  observations  lead  us  to  postulate  a  (cid:147)mat"  state,  in  which  all  the  monomers  in 

contact with  the  surface in the initial compressed state are obliged to remain there until 

some  slow  relaxation  process  has  occurred.  However,  the  remaining  monomers  are 

apparently mobile and free to swell with solvent. The mat thus consists of free loops of 

polymer between successive wall contacts. 

To characterize the behavior of the mat, we must first determine the distribution of loop 

lengths.    We  shall  take  the  initial  state  to  be  an  incompressible  melt  25  so  that  the 

polymers  are  Gaussian  random  walks  with  step  length  a.    The  distribution  of  segment 

lengths n between successive contacts with a neutral wall is a classic subject of random 

walk theory  1,26.  The probability p(n) that a loop has length n is proportional 1 to n-3/2.  

This  probability  distribution  is  altered  by  the  compressing  wall.    We  take  this 

compressing wall to be the midplane of the gap in the SFB (Sketch 1).  This neutral wall 

simply confines the polymer layer without adsorbing it.  This neutral wall increases the 

probability of contact with the adsorbing wall.  For very large n, the probability p(n) must 

fall off exponentially with n.  Since increased n does not bring the chain further from the 

adsorbing  wall,  each  increment  of  n  brings  a  constant  risk  of  touching  this  wall.    This 

exponential  falloff  evidently  sets  in  when  the  size  of  the  chain,  an1/2,  reaches  the  layer 

4

 

 

 

 

confining thickness h0.  Thus p(n) ~ exp(-n/n0), where n0 ≈  (h0/a)2 and a is the monomer 

size.  This exponential falloff continues until the loop length n reaches the length of the 

chain N.  From now on we shall assume that N is large enough to be considered infinite. 

Such a mat of loops is free to swell substantially in solvent, as first remarked by Guiselin 

1.  Guiselin found that this swelling results in a brush-like structure in which the volume 

fraction φ(z) at height z falls off as (a/z)2/5 in a good solvent.  This structure is unlike the 

original  adsorbed  layer,  in  that  the  surface  excess  now  increases  with  the  maximum 

length  of  the  loops.    In  our  mat,  this  maximum  is  n0,  since  loops  longer  than  this  are 

exponentially rare.  Following Guiselin’s treatment 1, we infer a brush thickness h ≈ an0

5/6 

or h ≈ a (h0/a) 5/3.   

Upon decompression, this mat must exert a restoring force.  The force exerted by general 

Guiselin brushes was worked out by Aubouy et al 22.  Their first step is to determine the 

volume fraction profile for a surface compressed from the brush thickness h to a smaller 

thickness  D/2.    As  in  a  conventional  monodisperse  brush  27,  this  φ(z)  retains  its 

unperturbed form for small distances but then becomes constant out to z = D/2. At strong 

compressions, the unperturbed region becomes negligible so that φ(z) becomes uniform: 

φ(z) ≈ 2Γ/ρD, where  Γ is the  polymer adsorbance on each surface and ρ is the polymer 

bulk  density  (1.13gr/cm3  for    PEO).  In  practice  (cid:150)  see  Table  1  (cid:150)  the  distance  of  closest 

approach h0 is, for all polymers studied, related to the adsorbance by a numerical factor, 

as  Γ/ρ ≈  (0.5–0.1)h0.  The  corresponding  osmotic  pressure  12,28,29    is  Π(D)    =  kTa-3 

5

 

 

[φ(D)]9/4 ≈ kTa-3 (2Γ/ρD)9/4. From this Π(D), we may find the work of compression, ∫ dD 

Π(D) ≈ kTa-3 (2Γ/ρ)9/4

 D-5/4.  It is this work that the SFB measures. 

The  SFB  is  sensitive  enough  to  detect  forces  at  separations  D  beyond  the  high-density 

thickness  regime  2h  of  the  two  brushes.    Thus,  it  readily  detects  surface  forces  of 

20µN/m, which implies a work of compression of kT per (36 nm)2 area.  Clearly in this 

force  regime,  any  polymers  producing  the  force  (typically,  a  few  large  loops)  are 

expected to be in a dilute state.  In this weak force regime, only the longest loops in the 

mat  contribute,  and  these  only  contribute  when  they  are  longer  than  usual.    In  order  to 

find the expected force, we begin by asking how the probability of a loop extending to a 

height  z  falls  off  with  z.  This  probability  can  be  expressed  as  p(z)  =Σn  p(n)pn(z).    The 

second factor pn(z), which is the probability that a loop of n monomers expands to height 

z, is, up to prefactors, equal to exp (-U(z)/kT), where U(z) is the work required to extend 

the  n-mer  loop  to  a  height  z.    In  a  good  solvent  12,  this  work  may  be  written  U(z)  ≈ 

kT[z/(an

ν

)]1/(1-ν), where ν, the Flory swelling exponent, is roughly 3/5 in a good solvent.  

As we have seen, the first factor p(n) has the form p(n) ~ exp (-n/n0), so that p(z) ≈ exp 

ν
[(-n/n0)-(z/an

)1/1-ν

]. 

From this information, we may find the limiting form of p(z) for large z; in this limit, the 

sum is dominated by those values of n that minimize this exponent: n ≈  (z/a) n0 

.  Then 

1-ν

p(z)  ≈  exp(-z/D0),  where  D0  ≈  a  n0

≈  a  (h0/a)

.  In  the  case  of  a  good  solvent,  D0≈  a 

ν 

 2ν

(h0/a)6/5.  Remarkably,  the  z  dependence  is  a  simple  exponential,  not  a  stretched 

exponential. 

The osmotic pressure exerted by these dilute chains is proportional to their number.  The 

work of compression is of the same order: it also falls off exponentially with z.  We infer 

6

 

 

that  the  force  seen  in  the  SFB  also  falls  off  exponentially  with  separation  D.      We 

summarize the predicted force profile in Sketch 2.

III. Comparison with measurements 

The  normal  forces  Fn  between  layers  of  poly(ethylene  oxide)  (PEO),  adsorbed  onto 

smooth,  curved

solid  (mica)  surfaces  across  the  good  solvent  toluene  have  been 

 

determined, in two different laboratories 16,17, as a function of the surface separation D, 

using  a  surface  force  balance  (SFB).  The  SFB  measurements  were  performed  with  five 

different  molecular  weights.  Results  measured  on both compression and decompression 

are  shown, where  the force axis is normalized by the radius of curvature R of the mica 

surfaces,  Fn(D)/R:  in  the  Derjaguin  approximation  30  (for  R>>D)  Fn(D)/2πR  is  the 

corresponding interaction energy E(D) per unit area between two flat parallel surfaces, a 

distance  D  apart  obeying  the  same  force-distance  law.  This  normalization  enables 

comparison  of  Fn(D)/R  profiles  from  different  experiments.  In  Figure  1-5  the 

experimental  force  (cid:150)  distance  curves  of  5  different  molecular  weights  are  shown.  The 

main features are as follows: on initial compression (indicated with solid symbols in the 

figures) a monotonic repulsion becomes detectable at a range of several Rg (7-9 Rg): This 

repulsion  falls  off  roughly  exponentially,  with  a  decay  length  of  (1.0–0.1)Rg,  for  all 

polymers studied.  This large decay length indicates weak, marginal adsorption 12,31. On 

decompression  immediately  following  close  approach  (indicated  with  open  symbols  in 

the figures), the forces are  considerably shorter-ranged, indicating the forced adsorption 

of  more  segments  onto  the  mica  surface  and  a  transient  compressive  distortion  of  the 

adsorbed  layers.  On  subsequent  recompression  the  layers  relax  back  to  their  original 

(equilibrium)  structure  to  an  extent  that  depends  on  the  molecular  weight  and  the  time 

before re-compression: for the 37 and 40 kg/mole polymers, full relaxation occurs even 

9

 

 

for (cid:145)immediate(cid:146) recompression (within 10 minutes following the first approach run). For 

the 112 and 160 kg/mole polymers, the relaxation on immediate re-compression is partial 

(indicated with cross symbols in figures 3 and 4), and full relaxation to the equilibrium 

Fn(D)  profile  occurs  only  after  about  one  hour.  For  the  310  kg/mole  polymer  on 

immediate re-compression  no relaxation can be detected, and full relaxation is obtained 

only  after  two  hours  or  more.  In  figure  1-5  the  forces  measured  on  decompression  are 

compared with the long-ranged exponential falloff: B exp(-D/D0), where D0 is the decay 

length,  and  with  the  short-ranged  power  law:  A  D-5/4,  as  predicted  by  our  model  (solid 

lines) (A and B are prefactors). It is impossible to fit the data only to one functional form, 

as can be realized from the broken lines at each figure. The main feature of the model - 

long-ranged  exponential  dependence,  is  well  supported  by  the  data.  In  particular,  the 

decay  lengths  predicted  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  measurement  (see  table  I).  The 

power law dependence fits the data in most cases, however due to the scatter in the data, 

it is not the only functional form that could fit the data. 

More detailed comparison between the experiments and the model is summarized in table 

I.  The  values  of  2h0  -  the  closest  approach  distance,  and  2h  -  the  distance at which the 

force  appears  to  go  from  a  power  law  dependence  to  an  exponential  one  (sketch  2) are 

obtained from the experimental data for each molecular weight (figures 1-5). The values 

of  h,  which  necessarily  have  a  large  scatter,  are  compared  with  the  prediction  of  our 

model:  h  ≈  a(h0/a)5/3  (  where  a  =  0.86–0.14  nm  28).  We  obtain  that  h/[a(h0/a)5/3]  is 

1.0–0.3.  Slight changes between the conditions of the two sets of experiments (the 37K 

and 112K 17 and the 40, 160 and 310K 16) contributed to the scatter in the prefactors. For 

example the amount of polymer adsorbed on the surfaces was smaller by 10% in the case 

10

 

 

of  37K  compared  to  the  40K.  The  exponential  decay  lengths  D0  from  figures  1-5  are 

compared  with  the  values  a-1/5(h0)6/5  expected  from  the  model,  and  we  find  that  D0/a-

1/5(h0)6/5 = 2.3–0.2, a rather satisfactory fit.

IV.  Discussion 

The  chief  support  for  our  mat  model  for  the  compressed  layer  lies  in  the  exponential 

falloff with distance seen for weak forces. In our model this dependence arises from the 

exponential distribution of loop lengths.  The observed decay length of this exponential is 

consistent  with  the  expected  behavior  of  the  mat  structure.    Despite  this  success,  some 

limitations  of  our  conclusions  should  be  noted.    First,  the  scatter  in  the  available  data 

clearly  prevents  a  stringent  test  of  our  model;  other  accounts  of  the  data  might  prove 

equally satisfactory.  Second, our simplified description has neglected some effects that 

might be significant.  Our assumption of melt conditions in the initial compression is only 

approximately satisfied, and may well be more valid for some data than for others.  Our 

treatment  of  the  compression  of  two surfaces as equivalent to confinement by a neutral 

12

 

 

 

 

wall  is  also  approximate.    It  neglects  possible  encounters  of  a  chain  with  the  opposite 

wall  and  it  neglects  interpenetration  of  chains.    Still  this  simple  assumption  seems 

adequate for the primitive inferences we have made.   

The  main  puzzle  raised  by  these  experiments  is  the  long  time  scale  of  the  relaxation.  

This slow relaxation cannot be accounted for fully by locally hindered mobility, since the 

relaxation becomes slower with increasing chain length N.  This N dependence suggests 

that the relaxation requires co-operative motion of large segments of the chains.  We are 

led to suggest a possible mechanism of this type.  In the expanded mat state the loops are 

stretched.    Tension  pulls  each  loop  at  its  anchor  points  on  the  surface.    Any  nonzero 

mobility  at  such  an  anchor  point  will  allow  the  loop  to  slip  along  or  through  the 

constraint,  thus  lengthening  the  loop.    At  the  final  stages  of  relaxation  the  layer  must 

resemble an equilibrium adsorbed layer, with a finite fraction of the chain very near the 

surface. Thus pulling out a loop entails a friction force proportional to the chain length.  

ν
The expected tension in the largest loops at this stage is of order kT/(a N

).  The loop is 

lengthened  at  a  speed  v  which  is  the  tension  divided  by  the  friction  factor:  v  ~  kT/(a 

N1+ν

).    Finally  the  time  τ  required  to  equilibrate  the  loop  is  of  order  N/v  ~  N2+ν

.    It 

remains to be seen whether such strong N dependence will be observed in practice.  The 

progression  to  this  final  relaxation  appears  interesting  and  rich,  as  it  involves  the 

lengthening  of  loops  in  competition  with  others  in  an  environment  of  mutual 

compression. 

13

 

 

The  mat  state  suggested  here  has  potentially  attractive  properties  for  a  solid-liquid 

interface.  Its brush-like structure resembles a grafted polymer layer, though only uniform 

homopolymers  are  needed  to  create  it.    Such  grafted  layers  often  show  superior 

performance  for  steric  stabilization.  Recent  work  32-34  suggests  that  grafted  layers  are 

particularly  effective  at  supporting  large  normal  loads  with  low  friction.    The  same 

virtues  might  be  expected  for  the  original  Guiselin  brush.  But  the  mat  state  appears  to 

achieve  some  of  these  same  virtues  without  requiring  a  bulk  polymer  melt.  Indeed  our 

high  molecular  weight  mats  showed  17  low  friction  effects  reminiscent  of  our  previous 

observation with polymer brushes 32.

form  between  the  oxygen  atoms  of  the  PEO  and  the  hydrogen  atoms  of  the  water 

molecules  (M.  Ide,  D.  Yoshikawa,  Y.  Maeda,  and  H.  Kitano,  Langmuir  15,  926-929,

This  is  a  reasonable  approximation;  for  example  for  the  37K  PEO  we  have 

adsorbance  Γ=0.9–0.3  mg/m2  so  that  a  compression  to  2h0  =  2.6–0.6  nm  would 

correspond to volume fraction of roughly 0.6. Similar if slightly lower values  (0.5–0.1) 

apply  for the other samples, see table 1. At these concentrations excluded volume effects 

are  negligible  (P.G.  de  Gennes,  Scaling  concepts  in  Polymer  Physics,  Cornell  Univ. 

Press, Ithaca, N.Y., 1979) and a gaussian random walk is a good approximation.

28  We  take the osmotic pressure equation as our definition of the monomer size a. 

From  the  force  profiles,  assuming  uniform  distribution  at  high  compression, we obtain: 

(F(D1)-F(D2))/R  =2πkTa-3  (2Γ/ρ)9/4  [D1

-5/4-D2

-5/4],  from  which,  for  values  of  D1, 

D2 < 2h we get a=0.86–0.14 nm.

Note  that  we  use  scaling  exponents,  though  at  the  highest  concentration  of  the 

strong compressed layers mean field exponents, might better apply. This is not expected 

to change our results qualitatively.

31        Indeed,  for  PEO  segments  adsorbed  onto  mica  from  aqueous  solution  the  net 

segment sticking energy is ca. 0.06 kT ( J. Klein and G. Rossi, Macromolecules 31, 1979

layer  thickness  is  greater  (ref.  16-18;  U.  Raviv  and  J.  Klein,  Polymers  Advanced

curvature of the  mica)  to yield  the interaction energy per unit area between flat parallel 

plates  obeying  the  same  Fn(D)  law,  in  the  Derjaguin  approximation30.  Measurements 

during compression and rapid decompression of the two surfaces are shown in different 

sets  of  experiments.  Solid  symbols  indicate  forces  measured  during  compression  and 

open symbols indicate forces measured during decompression.  We note that the profiles 

on  a  recompression  immediately  following  a  decompression  are  identical  (cid:150)  within  the 

scatter  (cid:150)  to  the  original  compression  profile.  The  data  is  taken  from  reference  17.  The 

solid lines are plotted where the prediction of the model fits the data well: the power low 

(in  the  short  range):  A  D-5/4  ,  with  A  =  511.5  mN/m  and  the  exponential  decay  (in  the 

long-range): Bexp(-D/D0), with B = 11.5 mN/m and D0 = 2.9 nm. The broken lines are 

the continuation of the solid lines, in the range at which the same functional form doesn(cid:146)t

 Abstract.  The  concept  of  Gravitational  Dipole  is  introduced  starting  from  the  recent
discovery  of  negative  gravitational  mass  (gr-qc/0005107  and  physics/0205089).  A  simple
experiment,  a  gravitational  wave  transmitter,  to  test  this  new  concept  of  gravitational
radiation source is presented.

1. INTRODUCTION

the 

time 

          When the gravitational field of an
object  changes,  the  changes  ripple
outwards  through  space  and  take  a
to  reach  other  objects.
finite 
These  ripples  are  called  gravitational
radiation  or gravitational waves .
          The  existence  of  gravitational
waves follows from the General Theory
of  Relativity.  In  Einstein's  theory  of
gravity 
gravitational  waves
propagate  at the speed of light.
          Just  as  electromagnetic  waves
(EM),  gravitational  waves  (GW)  too
carry energy and momentum from their
sources.  Unlike  EM  waves,  however,
there is no dipole radiation in Einstein's
theory  of  gravity.  The  dominant
channel  of  emission  is  quadrupolar.
But  the  recent  experimental  discovery
of  negative  gravitational  mass1,2
suggest 
the  possibility  of  dipole
radiation.

          According

However  recent  calculations  3    have
revealed that they are correlated by  an
adimensional factor, which depends on
the incident radiation upon the particle.
It  was  shown    that  there  is  a  direct
radiation
correlation  between

absorbed  by 
gravitational  mass,  independently  of
the  inertial  mass.  It  was  also  shown
that 
of
electromagnetic  radiation  this  factor
becomes  equal  to  one  and  that,  in
specific  electromagnetic  conditions,  it
can  be  reduced,    nullified    or  made
negative.  This  means  that  we  can
reduce,  nullify  or  make  negative  the
gravitational  mass  of  a  body.  This
  has

          Gravitational effects produced by
ELF  electromagnetic  radiation  upon
the electric current in  a  conductor  was
recently  studied  7.  An  apparatus  has
been  constructed  to  test  the  behavior
of  current  subjected to ELF radiation.
The  experimental  results  show  that

the 
gravitational  masses  of 
electrons  through  the  wire  produces
gravitational  radiation,  but  too  weak

when  the  electrons  become  "heavy",
the  gravitational  radiation  flux  can  be
very large.

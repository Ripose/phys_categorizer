measurements in the frequency domain has been built and 
is  under  test  [8].  Initial  measurements  with  a  single-cell 
cavity are presented in this paper.  

2 MEASUREMENT SETUP 
The  measurement  setup  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Two 
matching  sections  shown  schematically  in  the  figure  are 
placed  at  either  end  of  the  DUT  in  order  to  minimize 
losses  of  the  signal  from  the  network  analyzer.  Fig.  2 
shows  in  detail  a  matching  section.  It  consists  of  a 
broadband waveguide-coaxial matching section (W) and a 
removable  coaxial-wire  adapting  part  (C).  The  adapter 
pipe  is  flexible  enough  to  enable  the  movement  of  the 
wire  in  the transverse  plane.  This  is  achieved  by  moving 
the whole section head while the other end of the pipe is 
held fixed.

first two dipole bands of the standing wave structures and 
the first band for the traveling wave structures [9].

Abstract 

Dipole  modes  are 

the  main  cause  of 

transverse 
emittance dilution in the Japanese Linear Collider / Next 
Linear  Collider  (JLC/NLC). A  diagnostic  setup  has  been 
built in order to investigate them. The method is based on 
using 
and  measure 
electromagnetic  modes  of  accelerating  structures.  This 
method  can  offer  a  more  efficient  and  less  expensive 
procedure  than  the ASSET  facility.  Initial  measurements 
have been made and are presented in this paper.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Several  types  of  accelerating  structures  are  presently 
being  investigated  at  SLAC  for  the  JLC/NLC  [1].  Two 
main  issues  are  important  for  high  energy  physics 
colliders:  achieving  stable  operation  without  electrical 
breakdown  and  minimizing  long-range  wakefields.  In 
particular  dipole  wakefields  are  the  main  cause  of 
emittance  increase  and  beam  break-up  (BBU)  in  high 
energy  accelerators.  They  have  to  be  well  understood  in 
order to be able to damp them properly and thus obtain a 
high luminosity at the collision point. 

For the experimental study of  wakefields at SLAC, the 
ASSET  facility  has  been  used  in  the  past  [2].  There,  a 
witness  bunch  is  deflected  by  the  fields  excited  by  a 
leading  bunch,  sampling  in  this  way  the  wakefield. 
Although  it  has  proved  to  be  a  very  reliable  method,  in 
good agreement with the circuit model theory [3], a stand-
alone  setup  to  measure  dipole  wakefields  that  would  not 
require  the  use  of  a  beam  is  desirable.  The  wire  method 
fulfills this requirement.  

This method consists of sending a current pulse through 
a wire which runs through an accelerating structure under 
test [4,5,6]. One can measure the distortion of the current 
pulse  in  time  domain,  in  order  to  obtain  information 
directly on the wakefields, or the scattering parameters in 
frequency domain. In order to measure dipole wakes, the 
wire  is  displaced  from  the  axis.  Alternatively  two  wires 
placed symmetrically about the axis can be used [7]. 

Two  measurements  are  needed:  one  with  the  device 
under  test  (DUT)  and  one  with  a  reference  pipe.  From 
these 
information 
regarding the impedance of the modes  of the DUT [5,6]. 
From  the  integration  of  the  impedance  one  can  then 

two  measurements  one  extracts

The  matching  sections  have  been  first  investigated  by 
connecting them directly  with one another. A rod is used 
rather  than  the  C  matching  sections,  in  order  to  analyze 
the  W  sections  separately.  From  measurements 
in 
frequency  domain  using  a  network  analyzer  it  could  be 
seen that one of the waveguide-coaxial matching sections 
did  not  meet  the  design  specifications.  W1  presented  a 
reflection  coefficient  of  –18dB,  while  W2  meets  the 
design  goals,  having  a  reflection  of  about  –40dB  over 
most of the frequency range. When the rod was replaced 
with the wire and the C-matching sections, the reflection 
from  each  adapter  increased  to  about  –20dB.  HFSS 
simulations with an increased radius of the last step of the 
coax-wire adapter led to a reflection coefficient degraded 
by  –20dB.  This  increased  radius  occurred  due  to  a 
fabrication error. 

Utilizing  a  Fast  Fourier  Transform  the  time  domain 
signal  was  obtained.  Fig.  3  illustrates  the  reflection 
measured from matching section 1. Reflections above 0.1 
can  be  observed  from  each  adapter.  A  small reflection  is 
seen from the flange connecting the two adapters (at 2 ns). 
A  coupling  between  the  two  reflections  induces  a 
frequency  modulation  of  the  signal.  These  matching 
sections  were  used  for  initial  measurements,  while  more 
precise ones are in the process of being fabricated.

3 INVESTIGATION OF SINGLE CELL 

Measurements 

A  copper  single  cell  has  been  mounted  in  the 
measurement setup. The cell has a radius of 10.7 mm and 
a  length  of  9.8  mm.  The  pipe  itself  is  made  of  stainless 
steel and has a radius of 4.7 mm. The S parameters have 
been measured over the frequency range between 11 and 
18  GHz  with  the  DUT  as  well  as  with  a  reference  pipe 
having  the  same  length  as  the  cavity,  using  a  calibrated 
network  analyzer.  The  wire  has  been  approximately 
centered  in  the  system,  by  centering  the  ends  of  the 
matching  sections  in  the  fixture  system.  A  more  precise 
transverse  alignment  of  the  wire  has  been  then  achieved 
by  minimizing  the  amplitude  of  the  transmission  of  a 
dipole  mode  of  the  cavity.  The  wire  has  been  then 
displaced in 250 m m steps, to up to 2 mm offset from the 

axis.  Fig.  4  presents  several  measurements  at  increasing 
wire  offsets.  Both  the  measurement  with  the  DUT  (solid 
lines) and the one with a reference pipe (dashed lines) are 
shown. The dot-dashed lines will be explained in the next 
section. The maximum transmission is below unity, due to 
the  attenuation  in  the  coaxial  line  with  copper  central 
conductor and stainless steel walls and in the adapters. By 
comparison of the two curves in each plot it can be seen 
that most of the losses occur in the matching sections and 
beam  pipe,  the  ones  in  the  cavity  being  negligible  in 
comparison.

all 
measurements. This is due to the mismatch in the adapters 
shown in the previous chapter. A broad peak representing 
a monopole resonance in the cavity can be observed when 
the  wire  is  centered  in  the  device.  When  the  wire  is 
displaced by 1 mm, two higher quality resonances appear 
at  about  14.8  and  16.6  GHz.  They  represent  the  first 
dipole  modes  of  the  cavity,  TE-like  and  TM-like, 
respectively. The frequency of the first dipole mode stays 
constant  while  moving  the  wire,  while the  other  shifts to 
higher values. On approaching the cell axis, the frequency 
approaches the frequency of the mode in the unperturbed 
cavity. 

Simulations 

The S parameters have been calculated for a single cell 
attached  to  tubes  at  either  end  utilizing  HFSS  (High 
Frequency  Structure  Simulator),  in  order  to  understand 
the measurements. Both the wire and the cavity walls are 
assumed  to  be  lossy  (copper  wire  and  stainless  steel 
walls).  S12  obtained  from  simulation  is  compared  with 

the  data  in  Fig.  4.  The  amplitude  of  the  signal  is  much 
closer  to  unity  since  losses  in  the  matching  sections  are 
not  taken  into  account.  Despite  the  modulation  in  the 
measured  data,  there  is  a  clear  correspondence  between 
measurement  and  simulation.  A  discrepancy  is  observed 
in the frequency of the first dipole mode. 

Fig. 5 presents the frequency of the modes as a function 
of the wire offset. The crosses represent the measurement 
points  and  the  circles 
the  simulation  results.  The 
horizontal  dot-dashed  lines  mark  the  frequencies  of  the 
dipole modes in the unperturbed cavity. Good agreement 
between  simulation  and  measurement  up  to  50  MHz  is 
seen in the monopole and the second dipole mode. A shift 
of approximately 150 MHz is observed in the first dipole 
mode. A tilt in the wire or a coupling in resonances may 
explain this. Further studies are in progress to understand 
this discrepancy.

Wire offset [mm]
 
Figure  5  Synchronous  mode  frequencies  as a  function  of 
the  wire  offset  with  respect  to  the  axis:  measurements 
(crosses)  and  simulation  (circles).  The  horizontal  dot-
dashed lines represent the frequencies of the dipole modes 
of the cavity without perturbing wire. 

 
The electric field of the dipole modes is  shown in Fig. 
6.  The  TE-like  mode  almost  automatically  fulfills  the 
boundary  condition  on  the  wire  surface.  The  wire  only 
modifies the field distribution locally. The perturbation is 
therefore  small  and  the  frequency  is  not  changed.  In  the 
case  of the TM-like mode, the wire forces the  field lines 
to  change,  inducing  a  larger  perturbation.  The  frequency 
shift increases  when the  wire  is  moved  into  regions  with 

higher  field  amplitude.  We  note  that  in  the  case  of  the 
monopole  mode  (TM-like)  the  maximum  frequency 
change  is  when  the  wire  is  in  the  middle  of  the  cavity, 
where  the  field  is  also  maximum  (the  unperturbed 
frequency is 11.2 GHz). 

The  property  of  the  frequency  variation  with  the  wire 
offset  for  only  the  second  dipole  mode,  while  the  one  of 
the  first  one  remains  constant  is  characteristic  for  single 
cells.  For  multi-cell  cavities,  as  is  the  case  of  most 
accelerating  RF  structures,  the  modes  are  rarely  TE-like 
or  TM-like,  but  rather  hybrid  modes.  Therefore  the 
frequency  will  shift  in  both  modes  [8].  By  extrapolating 
the frequency curve at the axis, one can obtain the mode 
frequency. 

In order to characterize the wakefields it is important to 
have  knowledge  of  the  modal  loss  factors.  The  loss 
factors  of  the  modes  were  calculated  with  HFSS  for  the 
unperturbed cavity as well as in the presence of the wire. 
When  the  wire  approaches  the  cavity  axis  the loss  factor 
equals  the  value  corresponding  to  the  unperturbed 
structure.  The 
factors  are  currently  under 
investigation and will be reported in a later publication.

4 SUMMARY 
A setup to study dipole modes based on a wire method 
has been recently been built and is currently under test at 
SLAC.  A  test  cell has  been  mounted in  the  experimental 
setup  and  initial  measurements  have  been  made.  The 
measurement is strongly influenced by the mismatches in 
the  matching  sections.  Nevertheless,  agreement  with 
HFSS  simulations  has  been  observed.  The  frequency  of 
the first dipole mode is unperturbed by the wire due to the 
TE-like  character,  while  the  TM-like  dipole  mode  gives 
rise to a shift in frequency with the wire offset. This shift 
becomes zero as the wire is brought to the cavity  center. 
Further studies are in progress.

Abstract 

At a spallation neutron source, the wavelength of a neutron is generally determined by 

its  time-of-flight  (TOF)  from  the  source  to  the  detector.  The  achievable  precision  is 

ultimately  limited  by  the  non-zero  emission  time-width  of  the  source/moderator  system. 

Particularly, coupled moderators that are used to produce high intensity cold neutron beams 

show long “tails” in the intensity/time distribution for all wavelengths. For this reason much 

less intense decoupled moderators are often used for instruments that require high resolution.  

We present here a novel technique for dynamic energy  filtering of thermal and cold 

polarized neutron beams. The device consists of a polarizer/analyzer system and an energy-

selective spin-resonance  flipper. By drifting its resonance condition in synchronization with 

the TOF, the filter controls  the  energy resolution  of  a  broad bandwidth  TOF neutron  pulse. 

Calculations show that substantial resolution gains are obtainable by applying this technique 

to a TOF neutron reflectometer.

1.  Introduction 

One  of  the  most  difficult  problems  in  neutron  scattering  is  the  optimal  selection  of 

wavelength  resolution  for  each  experiment.  Given  a  constant  wavelength  (CW)  instrument, 

resolution is conventionally determined by the choice of a monochromating crystal. For time-

of-flight  (TOF)  instruments  at  reactor  sources,  the  wavelength-resolution  can  be  tuned  by 

changing  the  speed  of  a  chopper  and/or  the  width  of  the  chopper  window.  For  TOF 

instruments  at  spallation  neutron  sources,  the  wavelength  resolution  is  determined  by  a 

combination  of  the  moderator  architecture  and  the  instrument  length.  Many  instruments  at 

pulsed  neutron  sources  that  utilize  broad  bandwidth  would  gain  in  versatility  if  the 

wavelength-resolution  could  be  tuned  by  a  secondary  device,  allowing  the  user  to  trade 

intensity for resolution and vice versa. 

In  short-pulse  spallation  sources  [1],  neutrons  are  created  by  the  impact  of  a  proton 

beam onto a target material within a very small time interval (

t µ1<∆
s

). These high-energy 

neutrons  are  slowed  down  by  a  moderator  to  the  energies  suitable  for  use  in  neutron 

scattering  experiments.  In  order  to  gain  higher  intensity,  the  target  is  surrounded  by  a 

reflector assembly, which backscatters into the moderator neutrons that  would otherwise be 

lost.  There  are  two  classes  of  moderator-reflector  arrangements:  “decoupled”,  in  which  an 

absorbing  sheet  prevents  late-returning  slow  neutrons  from  entering  the  moderator,  and 

“coupled”,  in  which  all  neutrons,  including  those  that  thermalize  and  live  longer  in  the 

reflector, can enter the moderator. By eliminating the absorber, coupled moderators provide 

several  times  higher  neutron  fluxes  than  decoupled  moderators.  Coupled  moderators, 

however,  achieve  the  higher  flux  at  the  expense  of  causing  a  very  long  “tail”  in  the 

intensity/time  distribution  of  each  wavelength.  This  tail  degrades  the  resolution  of  the 

experiments, but it can be removed, if necessary, by means of a wavelength-resolution tuning 

device, the TOF spin-resonance energy filter, which is proposed below. 

An  instrument  that  would  certainly  benefit  from  large  wavelength  resolution 

flexibility  is  a  neutron  reflectometer.  Here,  resolution  requirements  can  strongly  depend  on 

the sample under investigation. Typically, monolayer films have low-resolution requirements 

(10  -  15%)  while  a  high-resolution  capability  (1%  or  even  better)  is  desirable  for 

measurements  on  films  of  several  thousand-angstrom-thickness.  If  one  chooses  a  high-

resolution monochromator for a CW instrument, one gives up most of the potential intensity 

for  low-resolution  measurements.  The  same  applies  for  a  TOF  reflectometer  at  a  pulsed 

source.  While  low  resolution  measurements  can  benefit  from  the  high  flux  provided  by  a 

 

2

coupled moderator, high resolution has typically been achieved by placing the instrument on 

a  decoupled  moderator  where  the  effective  neutron  beam  is  intrinsically  less  intense  or  by 

lengthening the flight-path at the expense of the bandwidth. Using instead a secondary energy 

filter to tune the energy resolution allows the use of reflectometers at high-intensity coupled 

moderators for both high-resolution and low-resolution measurements. 

 

2.  The wavelength resolution at pulsed neutron sources 

 In  order  to  demonstrate  the  capabilities  of  the  energy  filter,  we  have  calculated  the 

potential resolution gain for a reflectometer being designed for the Spallation Neutron Source 

project.  The  SNS  Magnetism  Reflectometer  [2]  will  view  a  coupled  moderator  of  liquid 

hydrogen  at  a  nominal  temperature  of  20  K.  The  performance  of  the  moderator  has  been 

calculated  numerically for a set  of wavelengths  in  the  range from 0.029  Å to  90.447  Å,  by 

using  the  MCMP  code  [3].  We  have  fitted  the  performance  analytically  in  the  wavelength 

range  that  is  relevant  for  reflectometry  (0.7  Å  to  14  Å)  by  means  of  a  modified  Ikeda-

Carpenter model [4]. 

Fig. 1 shows the neutron beam intensity at the face of the moderator as a function of 

emission  time  and  wavelength.  The  moderator  emits  neutrons  for  several  hundred 

microseconds after the peak of the pulse emission time distribution. The inserts show the time 

dependence  of  the  intensity  for  3.12  Å  and  9.35  Å  neutrons.  One  characteristic  of  the 

moderator  is  that  the  peak  emission  time  is  progressively  delayed  for  longer  wavelengths, 

relative to the time t = 0 when the proton pulse strikes the target (the wavelength dependence 

of the time of the  peak  intensity is plotted  as a dashed line). A second characteristic  of the 

moderator emission is an increase of its full-width-half-maximum intensity with wavelength, 

which is approximately linear within the studied range. These two features are not the main 

limiting  factors  for  the  wavelength-resolution:  a  more  serious  problem  is  the  presence  of  a 

long "tail" at later emission times. At the detector, neutrons of shorter wavelengths from the 

“tails” are not distinguished from longer wavelengths neutrons. 

 Fig. 2 shows an intensity contour plot as a function of time-of-flight and wavelength 

seen  by  a  detector  at  a  distance  of  19  m  from  the  moderator  -  the  approximate  distance 

estimated  in  our  reflectometer  design.  In  order  to  demonstrate  the  effect  as  clearly  as 

possible, the intensities at each arrival time have been normalized to unity at their peak value. 

The inserts show two cuts, respectively for a time-of-flight of 15 ms and 45 ms. For 15 ms 

the maximum intensity occurs at a wavelength of 3.12 Å and for 45 ms the maximum is at 

9.35  Å.  For  both  cases,  there  is  a  significant  contribution  of  neutrons  with  shorter 

 

3

wavelengths.  The  contour  lines  in  Fig.  2  are  practically  parallel  (except  for  wavelengths 

shorter  than  4  Å).  This  means  that  the  "tail"  neutrons  contribute  to  the  broadening  of  the 

wavelength-distribution  by  essentially  the  same  absolute  amount  for  each  time-of-flight 

channel.  Long-wavelength  neutrons  contain  a  relatively  smaller  wavelength  distribution  in 

their corresponding time channels. This is why better wavelength resolution can be achieved 

with long-wavelength neutrons. Both inserts in Fig. 2 display the wavelength axis over a 5% 

range relative to the peak wavelength. 

 

3.  The spin-resonance energy filter 

In 1962 G.M. Drabkin proposed [5], and experimentally confirmed in 1968 [6] a new 

way for selecting the velocity of polarized neutrons. The basic idea was to guide a polarized 

neutron  beam  (either 

the  direct  moderator  spectrum  or  a  spectrum  already  pre-

monochromated  by  a  mosaic  crystal)  through  an  electromagnetic  resonator.  This  resonator 

flips the neutron spin of a narrow wavelength band within the incoming wide spectrum. The 

flipped  fraction  of  the  beam  is  separated  from  the  rest  by  an  appropriate  polarization 

analyzer. Effectively, the device acts as a wavelength band-pass filter. 

Fig.  3  shows  a  possible  implementation  of  the  spin-resonance  energy  filter  (for  a 

thorough discussion of similar devices see Ref. [7]): A polarizing supermirror reflects spin-up 

neutrons  into  the  resonator.  At  the  exit  of  the  resonator,  a  transmission-type  spin-analyzer 

filters  (reflects  away)  the  spin-up  neutrons,  and  passes  only  those  neutrons  that  have  been 

flipped by the resonator. The resonator itself consists of a zigzag folded, DC current-carrying 

foil, that creates magnetic fields ±Hper, perpendicular to the flight path z of the neutrons and 

alternating their direction along z. In addition, a uniform magnetic guide field H0 is present, 

either perpendicular to both Hper and the neutron flight path, or along the neutron flight path. 

The  magnitude  of  H0  determines  the  angular  precession  frequency  of  the  neutron  magnetic 
 (γn = 1.83 x 

moment around the H0 axis. This Larmor precession frequency is 

H⋅

104 rad s-1 Oe-1 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the neutron). 

When a neutron of velocity v passes through the resonator, the alternating field Hper 

acts  with  a  frequency

on  the  neutron  spin,  where  a  is  the  distance  between  the

The  spin-flip  probability  function  has  two  characteristic  features  (see  Fig.  4  for  a 

graphical representation). First, the width of the central maximum is inversely proportional to 

the number of field reversals, which is equivalent to the number of current sheets M; i.e., M 

practically  determines  the  wavelength  resolution.  Second,  there  are  side  maxima  with 

flipping  probabilities  as  high  as  12%.  The  latter  can  be  avoided  by  several  methods,  as  is 

shown in Ref. [7]. 

The  energy  filter  was  first  considered  as  a  substitute  for  monochromators  at  steady 

state sources [8]. Unfortunately, even with its adjustable resonance wavelength (achieved by 

parallel  changes  of  H0  and  Hper),  flexible  selectivity  of  the  wavelength  bandpass  width 

(achieved by variation of M) and the high flipping-probability capabilities of the resonator, its 

5

application  at  a  steady  state  source  demands  formidably  high  efficiency  of  the  supermirror 

polarizer/analyzer.  

Our  proposal  is  to  use  the  filter  in  a  dynamic  way,  as  a  “pulse  shaper”  to  tune  the 

wavelength-resolution in TOF experiments at spallation neutron sources. We propose to use 

the same basic setup (see Fig. 3), but additionally drive the Drabkin resonator fields by fast 

power supplies to match the time structure of the pulsed source. The calculations, presented 

in the following, show that limitations of supermirrors with respect to polarization are not an 

issue for TOF pulse shaping. 

4. Tailoring moderator pulse shapes with a spin-resonance energy filter 

The  insertion  of  the  energy  filter  can  be  very  effective  to  cut  unwanted  tails  from 

neutron  beams.  In  TOF  instruments,  a  time-dependent  transmission  window  can  be  created 

by  drifting  the  resonance  condition  with  time.  This  can  be  achieved  by  appropriately 

controlling the magnetic fields Ho and Hper inside the  resonator  (see  Fig. 3).  Only  neutrons 

that  cross  the  resonator  at  a  certain  time  and  with  a  specific  wavelength  are  transmitted. 

Neutrons  that  do  not  fulfill  these  conditions  are  reflected  out  by  an  analyzing  supermirror. 

Note  that  the  rejected  neutron  stream  will  not  only  contain  the  previously  mentioned 

moderator  tail  neutrons,  but  also  delayed  neutrons  from  the  target  and  other  background 

neutrons. Therefore, the device may also significantly improve the signal to noise ratio. 

To test the effectiveness of the energy filter in removing the unwanted "tail" neutrons, 
we  started  by  arbitrarily  choosing  an  arrival  time  of  25365  µs  at  the  detector  (which  we 

assume to be positioned at 19m from the moderator). The corresponding peak in the expected 

wavelength distribution at this time-of-flight is 5.26 Å (see Fig. 5). The initially unpolarized 

beam  is  reflected  by  a  supermirror,  which  preferentially  reflects  spin  up  neutrons  with  a 

realistic  efficiency  of  20  to  1  (the  corresponding  reflectivities  are  95.24%  for  spin  up  and 

4.76%  for  spin  down  neutrons).  The  resulting  wavelength  distribution  at  the  detector  is 

displayed  in  Fig.  5a.  Next,  we  insert  the  magnetic  resonator  in  the  polarized  beam.  The 

device is placed at 9 m from the moderator and has 300 current sheets separated by 2.2 mm. 

The corresponding wavelength resolution  λ

 is 0.2%. The resonance condition is tuned to 

λ∆

λ 5.26 Å via the fields H0 and Hper. The resulting outgoing spectrum, obtained with the 

=

res

aid of equation (3), is displayed in Fig.5b. Note that, due to the non-symmetric peak shape of 

the initial wavelength distribution, a secondary maximum appears only at the left side of the 

spin-flipped  spectrum.  Finally,  we  add  an  analyzer  to  the  setup  in  order  to  filter  out  the 

 

 

6

narrow bandwidth region around 

λ  that has been flipped. As an analyzer, we have chosen a 

res

recently  developed  white  beam  neutron  spin  splitter  that  allows  using  the  transmitted  and 

reflected beam at the same time [9]. The flipping ratio of the analyzer has been reported to be 

25 for  the reflected beam  (mostly spin-up neutrons) and  100  for  the transmitted  part  of the 

beam  (mostly  spin-down  neutrons).  The  spin-resolved  transmitted  spectra  after  passing  the 

analyzer are shown in Fig. 5c. 

The  comparison  between  the  final  narrow  bandwidth  profile  and  the  incoming 

polarized intensity is displayed in Fig. 6. In both cases, we have added up the contribution of 

both spin states. One can clearly see that the neutron tail is removed very effectively and that 

the resulting spectrum is much more symmetric and sharper. Note that the intensity losses in 

the central part of the initial peak are only minor. An important side effect of the analyzer is 

that  the  beam  polarization  is  significantly  increased.  The  flipping  ratio  after  passing  the 

complete  energy  filter  system  improves  to  51  (corresponding  to  a  beam  polarization  of 

96.1%), compared to a flipping ratio of only 20 that is introduced by the initial polarizer.  

To extend the improvement for a particular time-of-flight channel to the entire time-

of-flight spectrum, one needs to continuously vary the resonance  condition by adjusting the 

currents which create the resonance fields Ho and Hper, as 1/t between neutron pulses. For the 

transition from the static (single TOF channel) to the dynamic (all TOF channels) operating 

mode, there is, however, an important design change necessary that is related to the physical 

length of the device (typically 0.5m - 1m): In order to achieve a spin flip for a neutron of a 

particular  wavelength,  this  neutron  must  encounter  an  appropriate  static  combination  of  H0 

and Hper all the way through the resonator. On the other hand, there is the requirement to drift 

the  field  strengths  proportional  to  1/t  in  order  to  match  the  resonance  to  the  actual  peak 

wavelength.  Both  conditions  can  only  be  fulfilled  by  introducing  field  compensation. 

solution for this problem is to superimpose an additional guide field H0

Calculations  show  that  the  guide  field  in  particular  requires  significant  compensation.  A 
* with linear gradient 
*  needs  to  have  the  same  1/t  dependence  as  H0.  Fig.  7  shows  the

To  ascertain  the  effect  of  beam  divergence  on  the  filter  performance,  we  have 

repeated the calculations above for incident angles within a range of ±1º. This angular range 

far exceeds  the divergence  of a  neutron beam typically used in measurements. Virtually  no 

angular dependence of the filter performance  can  be found. The  filter  effectively decouples 

the energy resolution and the angular resolution, allowing each to be adjusted independently.

5. An example: Resolution improvement for a reflectometer 

An example for a potential resolution gain in a neutron scattering experiment is given 

in Fig. 8. Here, we have simulated a reflectivity measurement from a 7000 Å Ni film on a Si 

substrate. The energy filter is located at  9 m from the  source and M=300 for  the resonator. 

The displayed q-range corresponds to a nominal wavelength-range of 6.0 Å - 5.3 Å The angle 
of incidence was assumed to be 0.57o. In Fig. 8a, we compared the reflectivity curve without 

resolution effects (thin line) with a convolution of this curve with the original SNS moderator 

wavelength/time structure (bold line). The insertion of the described energy filter gives rise to 

the  reflectivity  presented  in  Fig.  8b.  The  resolution  is  clearly  improved  to  the  extent  of 

bringing the experimental curve close to the bare Fresnel reflectivity. 

The  use  of  the  spin-resonance  energy  filter  is  beneficial  also  from  another  aspect: 

Conventionally the experimental reflectivities are assumed to be characterized by a resolution 

function of the type:

the relative width of  gaussian functions constant with the wavelength and with the angle of 

incidence. If this were the case, measurements taken over a span of wavelengths at different 

angles  could  be  seamlessly  spliced  together.  It  has  been  seen  that  this  assumption  is  only 

approximately  valid  [10]  particularly  at  small  angles.  Even  if  reflectivity  data  obtained  at 

different  angles  were  presented  separately,  their  fitting  to  a  model  should  be  accomplished 

with  the  help  of  Rietveldt  methods  [11],  which  would  use  correct  resolution  functions  for 

angle and wavelength. 

Our  proposal  to  utilize  the  energy  filter  as  a  "tail  cutting"  device  goes  a  long  way 

toward  alleviating  these  problems.  Compared  to  other  techniques  that  have  been  recently 

suggested for this function, it has the following general advantages: a) It works very well for 

instruments that use wide-bandwidth neutron beams. This is not true for a tail cutting chopper 

system  that  can  only  handle  a  narrow  bandwidth  region.  b)  The  resolution  can  be  altered 

rapidly by electronically changing the number of active current sheets. Disk choppers need on 

 

8

the order of  minutes  for re-phasing, an Eo  chopper much longer if slit packages need  to  be 

changed. c) It is practically insensitive to the angular divergence of the beam. In contrast to 

crystal  -  or  multilayer  -  based  monochromators,  angular  and  wavelength  resolution  are 

effectively decoupled in the energy filter.

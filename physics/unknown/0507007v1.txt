Through  the formulation of his law of thermal  emission, Kirchhoff  conferred upon blackbody radiation the
quality of universality [G. Kirchhoff, Annalen der Physik  109, 275 (1860)]. Consequently, modern physics holds that
such radiation is independent of the nature and shape of the emitting object. Recently, Kirchhoff’s experimental work
and theoretical conclusions have been reconsidered [P.M.L. Robitaille. IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science. 31(6),
1263 (2003)]. In this work, Einstein’s derivation of the Planckian relation is reexamined. It is demonstrated that claims
of universality in blackbody radiation are invalid.

From the onset, blackbody radiation was unique in possessing the virtue of universality [1,2]. The nature of the
emitting object was irrelevant to emission. Planck [3], as a student of Kirchhoff, adopted and promoted this concept
[4,5]. Nonetheless, he warned that objects sustaining convection currents should not be treated as blackbodies [5]. 

As previously discussed in detail [6], when Kirchhoff formulated his law of thermal emission [1,2], he utilized
two extremes: the perfect absorber and the perfect reflector. He had initially observed that all materials in his laboratory
displayed distinct emission spectra. Generally, these were not blackbody in appearance and were not simply related to
temperature changes. Graphite, however, was an anomaly, both for the smoothness of its spectrum and for its ability to
simply disclose its temperature. Eventually, graphite’s behavior became the basis of the laws of Stefan [7], Wien [8] and
Planck [3].

For   completeness,   the   experimental   basis   for   universality   is   recalled   [1,2,5,6].   Kirchhoff   first   set   forth   to
manufacture a box from graphite plates. This enclosure was a near perfect absorber of light (e  =1, k
 =1). The box had a
small hole, through which radiation escaped. Kirchhoff placed various objects in this device. The box would act as a
transformer of light [6]. From the graphitic light emitted, Kirchhoff was able to gather the temperature of the enclosed
object   once   thermal   equilibrium   had   been   achieved.   A   powerful   device   had   been   constructed   to   ascertain   the
temperature of any object. However, this scenario was strictly dependent on the use of graphite.

Kirchhoff then sought to extend his findings [1,2,5]. He constructed a second box from metal, but this time the
enclosure had perfectly reflecting walls (e  =0, k
 =0). Under this second scenario, Kirchhoff was never able to reproduce
the results he had obtained with the graphite box. No matter how long he waited, the emitted spectrum was always
dominated by the object enclosed in the metallic box. The second condition was unable to produce the desired spectrum.

As a result, Kirchhoff resorted to inserting a small piece of graphite into the perfectly reflecting enclosure [5].
Once the graphite particle was added, the spectrum changed to that of the classic blackbody. Kirchhoff believed he had
achieved universality. Both he, and later, Planck, viewed the piece of graphite as a  "catalyst"  which acted only to
increase   the   speed   at   which   equilibrium   was   achieved   [5].   If   only   time   was   being   compressed,   it   would   be
mathematically appropriate to remove the graphite particle and to assume that the perfect reflector was indeed a valid
condition for the generation of blackbody radiation.

However,  given the   nature  of  graphite,  it  is  clear   that  the  graphite  particle  was   in  fact  acting  as   a  perfect
absorber. Universality was based on the validity of the experiment with the perfect reflector, yet, in retrospect, and given
a modern day understanding of catalysis and of the speed of light, the position that the graphite particle acted as a
catalyst is untenable. In fact, by adding a perfect absorber to his perfectly reflecting box, it was as if Kirchhoff lined the
entire box with graphite. He had unknowingly returned to the first case. Consequently, universality remains without any
experimental basis.

Nonetheless,   physics   has   long   since   dismissed   the   importance   of   Kirchhoff’s   work   [9].   The   basis   for
universality, no longer rests on the experimental proof [i.e. 9], but rather on Einstein’s theoretical formulation of the
Planckian relation [10, 11]. It has been held [i.e. 9] that with Einstein’s derivation, universality was established beyond
doubt based strictly on a theoretical platform. Consequently, there appears to no longer be any use for the experimental

proof formulated by Kirchhoff [1,2,5]. Physics has argued [9] that Einstein’s derivation of the Planckian equations had
moved   the   community   beyond  the   limited   confines   of   Kirchhoff’s   enclosure.   Einstein’s   derivation,   at   least   on   the
surface, appeared totally independent of the nature of the emitting compound. Blackbody radiation was finally free of
the constraints of enclosure. 

In his derivation of the Planckian relation, Einstein has recourse to his well-known coefficients [10,11]. Thermal
equilibrium and the quantized nature of light (E=hu
  ) are also used. All that is required appears to be 1) transitions
within two states, 2) absorption, 3) spontaneous emission, and 4) stimulated emission. However, Einstein also requires
that gaseous atoms act as perfect absorbers and emitters or radiation. In practice, of course, isolated atoms can never act
in this manner. In all laboratories, isolated groups of atoms act to absorb and emit radiation in narrow bands and this
only   if   they   possess   a   dipole   moment.   This   is   well-established   in   the   study   of   gaseous   emissions   [12].   As   such,
Einstein’s requirement for a perfectly absorbing atom, knows no physical analogue on earth. In fact, the only perfectly
absorbing materials known, exist in the condensed state. Nonetheless, for the sake of theoretical discussion, Einstein’s
perfectly absorbing atoms could be permitted.

In his derivation, Einstein also invokes the requirement of thermal equilibrium with a Wien radiation field [8],
which of course, required enclosure [1,2]. However, such a field is uniquely the product of the solid state. To be even
more specific, a Wien’s radiation field is currently produced with blackbodies typically made either from graphite itself
or from objects lined with soot. In fact, it is interesting that graphite (or soot) maintain a prominent role in the creation
of blackbodies currently used at the National Bureau of Standards [13-17].

Consequently,   through   his   inclusion   of   a   Wien’s   radiation   field   [8],   Einstein   has   recourse   to   a   physical
phenomenon   which   is   known   to   be   created   exclusively   by   a   solid.   Furthermore,   a   Wien’s   field,   directly   involves
Kirchhoff’s   enclosure.   As   a   result,   claims   of   universality   can   no   longer   be   supported   on   the   basis   of   Einstein’s
derivation of the Planckian relation. A solid is required. Therefore, blackbody radiation remains exclusively a property
of the solid state. The application of the laws of Planck [3], Stefan [7] and Wien [8] to non-solids is without both
experimental and theoretical justification.

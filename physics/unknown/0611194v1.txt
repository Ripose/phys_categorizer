Abstract 

The  irradiation  represents  a  useful  tool  for  determining  the  characteristics  of  defects  in 
semiconductors  as  well  as  a  method  to  evaluate  their  degradation,  fact  with  important 
technological consequences.  
In  this  contribution,  starting  from  available  data  on  the  degradation  of  silicon  detector 
characteristics in radiation fields, these effects are explained in the frame of a model that 
supposes  also  the  production  of  the  SiBFFCDB  defect  due  to  irradiation.  The  displacement 
threshold  energies  –  different 
for  different  crystallographic  axes,  considered  as 
parameters  of  the  model,  are  established  and  the  results  obtained  could  contribute  to 
clarify these controversial aspects.  
Predictions  of  the  degradation  of  electrical  parameters  (leakage  current,  effective  carrier 
concentration and effective trapping probabilities for electrons and holes) of DOFZ silicon 
detectors in the hadron background of the LHC accelerator, supposing operation at -10P
PC 
are done. 
The  non  uniformity  of  the  rate  of  production  of  primary  defects  and  of  complexes,  as  a 
function  of  depth,  for  incident  particles  with  low  kinetic  energy  was  obtained  by 
simulations in some particular and very simplifying assumptions, suggesting the possible 
important contribution of the low energy component of the background spectra to detector 
degradation.

Introduction 
 
Silicon detectors were widely used in experimental modern high energy physics and they will 
represent possible candidates for the next generation of experiments in the energy range of 
few to tens TeV. They are elements of the high resolution vertex and tracking system, as well 
as of calorimeters. The high energy radiation existent in these environments will represent a 
major problem for long time operation. So, this investigation could represent a very useful tool 
for new materials and device geometries able to work in hostile radiation environments. 
In this contribution some aspects of the degradation of semiconductor material and of devices 
in radiation fields are investigated in the frame of a model that considers also the generation 
of the SiBFFCDB defect in silicon due to irradiation. Using the anisotropy of degradation correlated 
with the directions of crystallographic axes, values for the displacement threshold energy are 
established using the available data of the degradation due to irradiation on NBeffB and on the 
effective trapping probabilities of charge carriers for FZ and DOFZ materials. Predictions of 
the degradation of electrical parameters: leakage current, NBeffB and effective trapping 
probabilities for charge carriers for DOFZ silicon detectors in the hadron background of the 
0
LHC, at -10P
PC are done. 
A non uniformity in the rate of production of defects as a function of depth for incident 
particles with low kinetic energy is also predicted in some particular and very simplified cases.  
 
 
Model and results 
 
In a previous paper [1] the authors suggested that in the understanding of fundamental 
phenomena of degradation in silicon after irradiation, the consideration of the existence of the 
fourfold coordinated defect [2], as a primary defect, in addition to “classical” vacancies and 
interstitials, is essential because it has energy level(s) in the in the region of the middle of the 
bandgap. This defect introduces a new type of symmetry of the lattice. Fedina and co-workers 
[3] claimed that in situ HREM irradiation experiments put in evidence the existence of SiBFFCDB 
assigned to the known {113} defect. 
 
Lattice degradation due to irradiation is a complicated process. A basic quantity used to 
describe the response of semiconductor crystalline lattice to particle irradiation is the 
threshold energy for atomic displacements (EBdB). EBdB represents the minimum energy which 
leads to the formation of a lattice defect that survives at least the energy thermalization 
phase, when released to a target atom embedded in a crystalline host, lasting about 10 P
[4].  
The experimental determination of EBdB is a difficult task, since primary atomic displacements 
occur during very fast non-equilibrium events. The experimental detection of defects typically 
occurs at times much longer than 10P
damage may have annihilated. So, the measured EBdB represents an effective value. 
Experimental values between 11 and 40 eV have been reported, see for example [5] and the 
value depends on crystal symmetry and orientation, direction of the recoil in the lattice (which 
is function of the direction of the irradiation beam in respect to the axes of symmetry of the 
crystal, energy and the mass of incident particle) and temperature. 
The theoretical situation is not clearer, numerical results for EBdB in Si being spread in a wide 
>
range, and with values for ratio 

ˆ1 depending on the choice of the interatomic 
potential and on the dimension of the cells considered in the calculations. Thus, the concrete 
values for EBdB represent a controversial problem. 
 
In some previous investigations [6, 7] the validity and the performances of the model have 
been confirmed experimentally considering different situations: various damage rates, 
impurity concentrations and material resistivities, the contribution of different complex defects, 
the dependence on fluence, temperature and time, or material orientation on the degradation 
of leakage current, NBeffB, and the effective trapping probabilities for charge carriers.

Considering the contribution of the SiBFFCDB defect to the degradation of material and device 
parameters in radiation field, we analyse the effects of the displacement threshold energy on 
NBeffB, and on the effective trapping probabilities of charge carriers for FZ and DOFZ materials 
with <100> and <111> orientations, using available experimental data [8, 9]. Values of 
effective threshold energies for displacements of 19 and 26 eV give reasonable agreement 
with experimental data for <111> and <100> silicon irradiated samples respectively and 
improve the previous results of the authors.  
 
The degradation of the electrical parameters in conditions of continuous long time irradiation – 
as in the future experiments at high luminosities as LHC, is modelled, considering both an 
infinite and a finite lifetime for SiBFFCDB defect. The radiation field is considered in agreement 
with the simulation presented in Reference [10], at 20 cm from the interaction point. The 
results are presented in Figure 1. The calculations have been performed for both threshold 
energies established previously, 19 and 26 eV. A major difficulty in the correct establishment 
of the lifetime for SiBFFCDB defect is the absence of experimental data on time dependence of the 
degradation of the electrical device parameters. Continuous curves correspond to infinite 
lifetime of the SiBFFCDB defect, while dotted ones have been calculated for a lifetime of the order 
6
10P
P sec at room temperature, in agreement with Ref. [11] for I-V complexes.

Another aspect investigated is related to the degradation of silicon due to particles with low 
energies. In the concrete facilities, as LHC and its up-grade as SLHC, a complex background 
of radiation exists in the cavity where the detection systems are placed. Currently, the low 
energy component of the background spectra is cut in the evaluation of the degradation. A 
simple analysis of CPD (concentration of primary defects) in silicon due to different incident 
particles for energies below 20÷30 MeV suggests that the contribution of protons is higher 
than the contribution due other particles in same energy region. In these conditions, although 
in the simulated spectra the low energy region is characterised by lower values, these protons 
are very damaging, and cannot be removed from any analysis. 
 
The production of primary defects in silicon (a 300 μm thickness was considered) due to low 
kinetic energy (7 ÷ 50 MeV) protons was MC simulated using SRIM - 2006.02 version [12]. 
Preliminary results presented here are based on a simple model which supposes that the 
impurities (only oxygen, carbon and phosphorus are considered) are uniformly distributed in

the bulk of the silicon sample and the diffusion is neglected. An analysis of displacement 
production in the silicon bulk as a function of the kinetic energy of the incoming protons, 
starting from the lowest energies for which the protons exit the detector of considered 
thickness (7 MeV), reveals a non uniform rate of production of defects as a function of depth 
for incident protons with energies up to 15 MeV; at higher energies practically this 
phenomenon disappears. This effect is also influenced by the anisotropy of the threshold 
energy for displacements for different directions, but this aspect has not been studied here. 
Also, the existence of a difference between surface and bulk values for the threshold energy 
for atomic displacement must be mentioned. The rule ½ is the simplest approximation but this 
problem remains open. The following predefined SRIM values have been used: displacement 
energy -15eV, surface binding energy - 4.7eV, lattice binding energy – 2 eV. The distribution 
of vacancies and interstitials obtained by MC simulation has been used to obtain the 
distribution of complex defects: VB2B, VO, VP, CBiB, CBiBOBiB and CBiBCBsB. The results obtained for 7 MeV 
incident protons in these simplifying hypotheses show (see Figure 2) that at low fluences, up 
2
to 10P
P, defect distribution follows the distribution of primary defects, and the relative 
P p/cmP
contribution of each complex depends on the initial concentration of impurities and on the 
energy of formation of defects. The increase of the particle fluence conduces to a saturation 
of the volume concentration of defects related to impurities, limited by the initial 
concentrations of impurities.  
Further work with more realistic hypotheses is necessary.

Summary 
 
The consideration of a finite lifetime for the SiBFFCDB defect makes the model more realistic, but 
measurements of the detector characteristics over long time intervals, at room temperature, 
are necessary for the clarification of this aspect.  
 
Values of effective threshold energies for displacements of 19 and 26 eV give a reasonable 
agreement with experimental data for <111> and <100> silicon irradiated samples 
respectively.  
 
In the hypothesis considered in the simulation of the distribution of primary defects produced 
by low energy protons in the depth of silicon samples, a non-uniformity of damage in the 
depth has been obtained and this is maximised for particles which have a range equal to the 
thickness of the sample. The maximum of the damage is located at the side where the 
particle gets out. The increase of the energy of the incoming particles produces an increase in 
uniformity of the damage, and a decrease of its magnitude.

As a note for paper [physics/0505035], this is to make it more clear how we can depend
upon Einstein’s theory of gravitation and two assumptions of the cosmological principle
and the perfect fluid, in the so-called Z-approximation, to construct a solvable model of
cosmology  in  the  Earth-related  coordinate  system.  Hence,  the  cosmic  acceleration
becomes understandable.

The increasingly accurate cosmological measurements of the cosmic  microwave  background  [1-
4]  and  the  high  red-shift  type  Ia  Supernovae  [5-7]  indicate  an  acceleration  of  the  expansion  of  the
Universe. This cosmic acceleration is unexpected in the standard model of  cosmology  [8-12].  It  severely
challenges the standard model of cosmology and urges cosmologists to make much theoretical corrections
and  attempts  including  to  probe  the  nature  of  mysterious  anti-gravitational  dark  energy  or  quintessence
field [13-14], to modify Einstein’s theory of gravitation [15-17] and to develop the inflation scenario [18-
19].  As  said,  however,  no  well-developed  and  well-motivated  solutions  have  yet  emerged  [15,16].
Actually,  we  attempted  another  way  in  our  recent  work  [20-22]:  to  construct  a  solvable  model  of
cosmology in the Earth-related coordinate system. This note is to make it more clear how we can depend
upon Einstein’s theory of gravitation  and  two  assumptions  of  the  cosmological  principle  and  the  perfect
fluid, in the Earth-related (or Earth-based) coordinate system, to construct such a model.

From very beginning [23-26] and till now [8-12], to construct the standard model of cosmology,
cosmologists adopted the co-moving coordinate system which, at any point in space, is at rest with respect
to the matter located at that point. We adopted the Earth-related coordinate system, in which the Earth is
always  at  rest,  for  the  same  purpose.  The  motivation  to  do  so  was  brought  about  by  the  following
considerations. (1) We are living on the Earth. Our cosmological measurements are all with respect to the
Earth-related  coordinate  system.  We  should  carry  out  our  theoretical  calculations  in  the  Earth-related
coordinate  system  to  ensure  a  direct  comparison  between  measurement  data  and  calculation  results.  (2)
The  Earth-related  coordinate  system  is  at  least  approximately  an  inertial  coordinate  system  if  the
discussed gravitational field of the Universe is turned off. That will provide with a useful constraint when
we solve the Einstein field equation in the gravitational field of the Universe.

As  is  usual  with  the  standard  model  of  cosmology,  we  can  start  with  two  assumptions  of  the
cosmological  principle  and  the  perfect  fluid  for  the  matter  of  the  Universe.  The  cosmological  principle
states:  With  respect  to  the  Earth-related  frame  of  reference,  the  Universe  is  spatially  homogeneous  and
isotropic  on  large  scales.  The  assumption  of  the  perfect  fluid  specifies  the  energy-momentum  tensor  for
the matter of the Universe to be

homogeneity  and  isotropy  in  space.  Moreover,  this  fluid  velocity  magnitude  is  the  same  everywhere  in
space  again  because  of  the  large-scale  spatial  homogeneity.  It  must  be  the  most  probable  velocity
magnitude of the perfect fluid. We now take an approximation: the most probable velocity  magnitude  of
the  perfect  fluid  vanishes  with  respect  to  the  Earth-related  frame  of  reference.  We  call  it  the  Z-
approximation.  The  Z-approximation  is  reasonable  since  the  most  probable  velocity  magnitude  of  the
perfect fluid is small as most (around 87 percent) of the gravity-interacting matter of the Universe is made
up of dark matter that is cold and the cosmic background temperature is very low, 2.7K.

The  cosmological  principle  also  implies  that  the  Universe  is  filled  with  the  gravity-interacting
matter which distributes uniformly in space, in other words, non-zero mass density ρ of the matter of the
Universe  is  independent  of  spatial  coordinates.  It  is  independent  of  time  coordinate,  too.  Otherwise,  we
will  face  the  problem  that  mass  would  be  created  (or  annihilated)  with  the  same  rate  everywhere  in  an
arbitrarily big but finite spatial region.

In  the  Earth-related  coordinate  system,  owing  to  the  Z-approximation,  we  have  fluid  velocity:

Universe for our model of cosmology. This model is solvable receiving benefit  from  adopting  the  Earth-
related coordinate system.

Even this solution enables us to understand the observed cosmic acceleration. Readers may refer

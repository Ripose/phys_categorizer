We propose a new cross-correlation method that can recognize independent realizations of the same 
type of stochastic processes and can be used as a new kind of pattern recognition tool in biometrics, 
sensing, forensic, security and image processing applications. The method, which we call bispectrum 
correlation  coefficient  method,  makes  use  of  the  cross-correlation  of  the  bispectra.  Three  kinds  of 
cross-correlation coefficients are introduced. To demonstrate the new method, six different random 
telegraph signals are tested, where four of them have the same power density spectrum. It is shown 
that  the  three  coefficients  can  map  the  different  stochastic  processes  to  specific  sub-volumes  in  a 
cube. 

Keywords:  Stochastic  process  recognition,  Bispectra,  Pattern  recognition,  Forensic,  Security,  Bio-
metrics. 

1.  Introduction 

Identification and pattern recognition techniques are of crucial importance in biometric, 
sensing, forensic, security and image processing applications. In this Letter, we will in-
troduce a new method, which is a process recognition tool, recognizing different types of 
stochastic processes. The method is based on the bispectra (a higher order statistical tool) 
which have recently been  applied  to  identity  gases by  fluctuation-enhanced gas  sensing 
[1, 2]. 

We name this new process recognition tool bispectrum correlation coefficient (BCC) 
method because it utilizes normalized cross-correlation coefficients based on the bispec-
tra of the process realizations. 

Conventional  cross-correlation  techniques  recognize  only  the  same  realization  of  a 
stochastic process, and they give zero value for the independent realizations of the same 
process or for two different processes. Consequently, cross-correlation techniques cannot 
distinguish between the case of two independent realizations of the same process and that 
of two different processes. In this letter, we will show that the BCC method is useful for 
the identification of stochastic processes even though their power density spectra (PDS) 
or amplitude distribution functions are indistinguishable.

3.  Demonstration by computer simulations 

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the BCC method in stochastic processes, we consider 
six different types of random telegraph signals (RTS) and generate seven realizations of 
each type. The six different RTS types are as follows:

•  RTS 1 has only two amplitudes, 1 and -1. The value is switched at Poisson time 

events with rate 0.2/step.  

•  RTS 2 has only two amplitudes, -1 and 1. The amplitude of the signal is changed 
by the combination of two Poisson rates depending on the amplitude of the sig-

nal. The Poisson rate is 0.22/step at the amplitude 1 while it is 0.18/step at the 
amplitude -1.  

•  RTS 3 has continuous amplitudes randomly selected at each Poisson time 

events. The amplitude values are uniformly distributed in the range [-1.74, 1.74]. 
The Poisson rate is 0.4/step.  

•  RTS 4 has initial amplitude chosen randomly from the range [0, 2.45]. At a 

Poisson time event, the amplitude is changed as follows: if the amplitude is posi-
tive, the next amplitude is the previous one minus a random number uniformly 
distributed in the range [0, 2.45]. Otherwise, the next amplitude is the previous 
one plus a random number generated in the same way. Here, the Poisson rate is 
0.4/step.  

•  RTS 5 has only two amplitudes, 1 and -1. The -1 amplitude is the ground state 

and the 1 amplitude belongs to a "firing" event. At a Poisson time event, firing is 
initiated. After a uniformly distributed random period, which is selected from 
the range of 1-11 steps, the firing is terminated and the system is reset to the 
ground state. Then a new Poisson timing starts for the initiation of the new firing 
event. The Poisson rate is 0.1/step.  

•  RTS 6 has only two amplitudes, 1 and -1. The signal holds its original amplitude 
for a random time period. After a random period uniformly distributed in the in-
terval 1-26 steps, the sign is alternated.  

 
The evaluation of the statistical properties of the RTS signals was obtained by computer 
simulations. The simulation length of each sample is 1024 and the number of samples is 
4096. Figure 1 shows the probability or the amplitude density function (ADF) g(x) of the 
six RTSs. Since the amplitude of RTS 1, RTS2, RTS 5, and RTS 6 is discrete, we need to 
use probability, not the amplitude density function. P1 and P-1 are probabilities for ampli-
tude to be found 1 and -1 at a step, respectively. P1 and P-1 in RTS 1 is the same since the 
Poisson rate is constant. In RTS 2, P-1 is bigger than P1 since the Poisson rate depends on 
the amplitude. The amplitude density function of the RTS 3 is uniform since the ampli-
tude is selected randomly in a uniform distribution and the Poisson rate is constant. The 
amplitude density function of the RTS 4 has a maximum at the amplitude zero and zero at 
the  amplitude  2.45  or  -2.45  since  the  smaller  absolute  value  of  the  amplitude  happens 
more frequently than the bigger.  In RTS 5 case, since the condition for the amplitude 1 is 
different from that for the amplitude -1, P1 and P-1 is not the same. Since the random time 
period is independent of the amplitude, P1 and P-1 in RTS 6 is the same. These properties 
of the RTSs are shown in Figure 1 as expected. Figure 2 shows the PDSs of the six RTSs. 
It can be seen that RTS 1 through RTS 4 have the same PDS, but the PDSs of RTS 5 and 
RTS 6 are different.  

Let us call auto-BCC the BCC between different realizations of the same type of sto-
chastic process and cross-BCC the BCC between realizations of different stochastic proc-
esses, respectively. We generated 7 independent realizations for each RTS and evaluated 
the bispectrum for each signal. Thus the simulations provide 21 (=7*6/2) auto-BCCs for 
each RTS and 49 cross-BCCs for each pairs of RTSs. 

We  use  a  3-dimensional  plot  (see  Figure  3)  so  that  the  x-coordinate  corresponds  to 
the  RBCC,  the  y-coordinate  to  the  IBCC,  and  the  z-coordinate  to  the  MBCC,  respec-
tively. Thus the BCC plot of any realization of any stochastic process with itself would be 
a fixed point with  coordinates  (1,1,1). In Figure 3, the  point groups  labeled  ‘a’  through 
‘f’, represent the cross-BCCs while the points inside the ellipse represent the auto-BCCs. 

J. U. Kim and L. B. Kish 

The label ‘a’ represents the RTS 4-5 pair, the label ‘b’ the RTS 2-5 pair, the label ‘c’ the 
RTS 2-4 pair, the label ‘d’ the RTS 1-4, 1-5, 3-4, 3-5, 4-6, and 5-6 pairs, the label ‘e’ the 
RTS 1-2, 2-3 and 2-6 pairs, and the label ‘f’ the RTS 1-3, 1-6 and 3-6 pairs. The plots of 
almost  all  of  the  cross-BCCs,  except  that  of  the  2-4 pair, are  around  the  z  axis;  that  is, 
they have about zero RBCC and IBCC. The plots of the cross-BCCs of the 2-4 pair also 
have zero IBCC, but nonzero RBCC.  Figure 4 shows the projection of the 3-dimensional 
BCC plot onto the RBCC-IBCC plane. The features of the BCC location are as follows: 

•  The plots of the cross-BCCs are around the z axis.  
•  The  plots  of  the  BCCs  tend to  form  well  distinguishable  groups  which tend  to 

form characteristic shapes.  

•  The  plots  of  the  auto-BCCs  tend  to  form  lines  and  the  cross-BCCs  form  3-
dimensional bundles. Because their locations and shapes are strongly different, 
they are clearly distinguishable from each other.

2-4 pair, the label d RTS 1-4, 1-5, 3-4, 3-5, 4-6, and 5-6 pairs, the labeled e RTS 1-2, 2-3 and 2-6 pairs, and the 
labeled f  RTS 1-3, 1-6 and 3-6 pairs. 

 

Recognizing different types of stochastic processes 

Therefore, the BCC method is a new type of pattern recognition tools. It is useful to de-
termine which type of stochastic processes a realization belongs to. Conventional correla-
tion  technique  is  unable  to  do  that.  When  we  test  if  a  certain  realization  x(t)  of  an  un-
known stochastic process is a realization of a known stochastic process K, we calculate 
and plot the BCCs of the x(t) process and several realizations of the process K. Then we 
get a bundle of points in the 3-dimensional space.  The location and the shape of the bun-
dle of the BCC points in Figure 3 and Figure 4 can be regarded as a classifier.

4.  Summary 

A  new  cross-correlation  technique,  which  gives  enhanced  information  about  stochastic 
patterns,  the  bispectrum  correlation  coefficient  method,  was  introduced.  We  demon-
strated  the  usefulness  of  the  BCC  method  with  six  types  of  random  telegraph  signals. 
This  new  pattern  recognition  has  potential  applications  in  biometrics,  sensing,  forensic, 
security, and image processing.

Abstract: May randomness (real numbers, opinions) evolve into order (regularity) with time? 
We  study  some  polarization  and  symmetry  properties,  which  emerge  in  time  evolution  of 
opinions (real numbers) within entries of two and three-dimensional lattices, which had initial 
randomness. 
 
1 
Introduction:  Entries  (i)  of  a  lattice  (M=NxN  for  square,  and  M=NxNxN  for  cubic 
lattices) have  random (homogeneous) distribution of initial opinions (Qi(0)) in terms of real 
numbers.  In  usual  iterative  interaction  tours  (time,  t)  only  the  nearest  neighbor  (nn)  entries 
interact and opinions (Qi) average [1]; 

Qi(t) = (Qi(t-1) + ∑j

nn Qj(t-1) )/(ρ+1)   , 

 

 

where ρ is the number of nn for (i). We follow parallel (synchronous) updating. 

   The average opinion for the lattice (Qav(t)) at a given interaction tour be given as 

Qav(t) = QT(t)/M = (∑M

 
where QT(t) is the total opinion at a given time, i.e., QT(t) = ∑M

iQi(t) )/M   ,

(2) 

iQi(t), and Qav(t(cid:198)∞)= Qav(∞). 

   Are Qi(t) (Eqn. (1)) random for 0<t<∞, with random Qi(t=0)? Or, may Qi(t) involve some 
polarization and symmetry for 0<t<∞? 

   In a recent paper [2], we had observed some unexpected polarization and symmetry features 
in lattices during time evolution of opinions. In this contribution we study them in detail. 
 
2 
Order  (regularity),  polarization  and  symmetry:  We  announce  that,  initial 
randomness in opinions is observed to evolve into order (regularity) with time, under certain 
conditions.  Performing  parallel  (synchronous)  updating  (Eqn  (1)),  we  observed  the  initial 
random  opinions  evolving  into  order  (regularity).  Opinions  are  observed  to  display 
polarization  for  t<∞;  and  what  we  mean  by  polarization  is  the  order  (regularity)  within 
opinions  as  follows:  One  corner  or  edge  of  the  two-dimensional  lattice  involves  opinions 
greater  than  Qav(t),  and  the  opposite  corner  or  edge  involves  these  less  than  Qav(t),  or  vice 
versa.  One  may  define  Q’i(t)  as,  Q’i(t)=Qi(t)  –  Qav(t),  and  the  mentioned  symmetry  (and 
polarization)  properties  come  out  about  zero  (since,  Qav(t)(cid:198)Qav(∞),  as  t(cid:198)∞)  for  Q’i(t). 
Moreover, distribution of opinions at t<∞ over the entries are observed to be invariant (up to 
numerical approximations performed by the software that we utilized) under many symmetry 
operations  such  as  rotation  of  the  lattice  by  (some  integer  multiples  of)  ±π  about  body  axis 
and  about  bisector  of  any  edge,  inversion,  etc.  And,  accuracy  (up  to  the  mentioned 
approximations) within such symmetries are observed to increase with time, as Qi(t)(cid:198)Qav(∞),  
for  t(cid:198)∞  and  Qav(t)(cid:198)Qav(∞),  for  t(cid:198)∞;  similarly,  as  Q’i(t)(cid:198)  Q’av(t)  for  t(cid:198)∞  and  Q’av(t)(cid:198) 
Q’av(∞)=0 for t(cid:198)∞. All of the polarization and other symmetry features decay ultimately. 

   Figure  1  is  the  evolution  of  Qi(t)  (Fig  1a),  and  that  of  Qav(t)  (Fig.  1a),  for  a  8x8  lattice; 
where,  Qav(t=200)=0.0019=~Qav(t(cid:198)∞).    Please  note  that,  Qav(t)  varies  (either  decreases  or 
increases  (Figs.  3  and  4)  linearly  in  logarithm  of  time,  (as  arrows  in  the  relevant  figures 
designate)  for  the  first  ten  tours  (t)  or  so.  In  many  runs  we  observed  that  the  slope  of  the 
mentioned variation in Qav(t) decreased with increasing N, i.e., we observed steeper decreases 
or increases for smaller N, where minor modulations may appear due to initial randomness. 
Figure  2  displays  the  polarization  within  the  same  lattice  at  t=150,  where  parallel 
(synchronous) updating is performed in terms of Eqn. (1). 

   We  investigate  polarization  and  symmetry  properties  of  opinions  in  two  parts:  Firstly  we 
study  two-dimensional  lattices.  Later,  we  consider  three-dimensional  lattices,  in  terms  of 
faces and bulk. 
 
3 
Applications  and  Results:  Initially  we  charge  lattices  homogeneously  with  random 
real  numbers  (Qi(0),  where  -1.0≤Qi(0)<1.0).  And,  let  the  opinions  evolve  in  terms  of 
averaging process [1] (Eqn. (1)), where we apply parallel (synchronous) updating.

Two dimensional lattices 

In this section we consider 10x10 and 9x9 lattices, with even and odd dimension, respectively. 

   For a square lattice, ρ=4 (in Eqn. (1)) if (i) is in the square, ρ=3 if (i) is on an edge, and ρ=2 
if (i) is at a corner. 

   In Figures 3, and 4 we show time evolution of Qav(t) (Eqn. (2)), for 10x10 and 9x9 lattice, 
respectively. Please note that Qi(t) varies linearly in logarithm of time in all; Qi(t)(cid:198)Qav(∞), as 
t(cid:198)∞. Similarly Qav(t)(cid:198)Qav(∞), as t(cid:198)∞. (Also see, Fig. 1 b.) We observe that, convergence of 
Qav(t)  is  slower  for  bigger  dimension  (N).  Secondly,  lattice  sum  of  the  opinions  (QT(t)=M 
Qav(t), Eqn (2)) is not conserved through the evolution, i.e., QT(t≠0)≠ QT(t=0); also in Fig. 1 b.  

Observations:  

1)  Qi(t)(cid:198)Qav(∞) as t(cid:198)∞, (i.e., Q’i(t)(cid:198)0 as t(cid:198)∞) independently of the sub index and the 

number of dimension of the lattice (N). (Figs. 1, 3, and 4.) 

2)  Initial  randomness  within  opinions  does  not  survive,  and  it  decays  rapidly,  within 
about ten tours for N≤10 (Figs. 1, 3, and 4.). We name this period of time the short run 
(first epoch). Afterwards, patterns (variation of opinions along any edge from entry to 
entry)  start  to  display  regularities,  and  we  observe  repeated  patterns.  Whenever  the 
polarization in lattice develops, one end of an edge of the lattice may involve a greater 
opinion  than  the  other  end  (or,  vice  versa).  We  name  this  period  of  time  the 
intermediate  run  (second  epoch).  As  time  evolves  the  patterns  smooth  and 
Qi(t(cid:198)∞)(cid:198)Qav(∞); we name this period of time as long run (third and ultimate epoch).  

3)  For  intermediate  run,  we  have  clear  polarization  within  Qi(t).  Namely,  Qi(t)  varies 
smoothly and continuously (about Qav(t) in the second epoch, and about Qav(∞) in the 
third epoch) from one corner of a square of the lattice to diagonally opposite one; from 
a  higher  value  to  a  lower  one,  or  vice  versa.  Polarization  may  occur  also  from  one 
edge of a square to the opposite edge (or at least approximately), where one may rotate 
the  opinions  on  any  pair  of  opposing  edges  by  π,  about  the  corresponding  Cartesian 
axis (or perform other symmetry operations) and obtain the opinions on the opposite 
edge. We performed many runs for many t and N; and observed the mentioned case in 
many of them, as expected. (See, Figs. 3. Others are not shown.) 

4)  We  run  our  evolutions  many  times,  with  different  random  initials  Qi(t=0),  i.e.,  for 
various a, and b in a≤Qi(0)<b, and observed similar results as mentioned in previous 

cases.  Sum  and  difference  of  opinions  along  edges  too  came  out  as  independent  of 
lower and upper bounds for initial random real numbers; yet, with different patterns. 
Some  other  linear  (and  possibly  non-linear)  combinations  of  opinions  may  display 
several types of (other) symmetries. 

5)  We  had  randomness  at  the  beginning,  Qi(t=0);  and  we  have  ultimate  equality, 
Qi(t(cid:198)∞)=Qav(∞),  and  probability  density  function  (PDF)  for  Qi(0)  was  (almost) 
constant (due to homogeneity in random numbers). We have delta PDF ultimately (not 
shown). 

 
   We  may  explain  the  situation  as:  Origin  of  the  mentioned  symmetries  in  opinions  is  the 
symmetry  properties  of  the  lattice  under  consideration  and  symmetries  are  induced  onto 
opinions  by  means  of  averaging  process  given  (Eqn.  (1)),  where  the  given  expression  is 
symmetric with respect to (i), and nn entries. And, discontinuity at the borders of the lattice 
may be neglected for large N. We have perfect cubic symmetry properties ultimately, i.e., as 
t(cid:198)∞. Yet, as t(cid:198)∞, Qi(t)(cid:198)Qav(∞).  

 

3 b 

Three dimensional lattices 

In this section we consider cubic lattices with various (N) (figures are not shown). 

   For a cubic lattice, ρ=6 (in Eqn. (1)) if (i) is in bulk, ρ=5 if (i) is on a cubic face, ρ=4 if (i) is 
on a cubic edge, and ρ=3 if (i) is at a corner. And, we follow parallel (synchronous) updating. 

   Within  all  the  figures  we  obtained  for  Qi(t)  varying  linearly  in  logarithm  of  time;  Qi(t)(cid:198) 
Qav(t),  as  t(cid:198)∞.  Similarly  Qav(t)(cid:198)Qav(∞),  as  t(cid:198)∞.  And,  the  convergence  is  much  slower, 
when compared with the case for two-dimensional lattices with the same N. 

   As  in  the  two-dimensional  lattices,  we  have  three  evolution  epochs  present,  and  in  the 
second  epoch  (intermediate  run)  we  observe  similar  polarization  and  symmetry  relations 
within  cubic  lattices  as  we  observed  in  square  ones.  Polarization  emerges  on  each  (square) 
face and within bulk; so, it continues from one face to the opposite face through the bulk. In 
the  same  manner,  we  have  polarization  along  any  line  connecting  the  surfaces.  In  the  third 
epoch symmetries and polarizations all decay with Qi(t(cid:198)∞)(cid:198)Qav(∞). 

   In  summary,  we  have  polarization  and  symmetry  within  opinions  in  three-dimensional 
lattices,  which  are  very  similar  to  the  case  in  two-dimensional  lattices;  yet,  we  have  more 
symmetry relations (due to the point group of cubes, which is richer than that of squares). 
 

3 c 

Extraordinary cases: We tried three extraordinary cases, which are: 

1) 

Extra  ordinary  initiation:  We  fed  the  lattice  with  random  numbers  only  for 
some (i), and left the other entries as zero. We confined the nonzero portion 
about  the  center,  as  a  square  with  dimension  n<N,  for  two-dimensional 
lattices,  and  as  a  cube  with  dimension  n<N,  for  three-dimensional  lattices. 
We  also  performed  many  runs,  where  the  nonzero  portion  was  about  any 
corner.  And  we  obtained  polarization  and  symmetry  in  all  of  these  cases. 
Furthermore  we  tried  some  functions  as  Qi(0)=sin(I/N)  +  sin(J/N),  and 
Qi(0)=(I/N) + (J/N), with (I,J)=(i) for two-dimensional lattices, and observed 
polarizations  and  symmetries  in  all.  One  may  expect  similar  results  for 
three-dimensional lattices. 

2) 

3) 

Random interaction: We selected the averaging entries randomly (instead of 
following Eqn (1)); where, at each tour, the opinions involved by only two 
randomly selected entries ((i) and (i’), say) are averaged. In this case, we did 
not  observe  any  polarization  and  symmetry  features  within  the  evolving 
opinions.  

Broken bonds: It may be underlined that, only the nn sites are considered up 
to  now,  and  we  observed  (two-  and)  three-dimensional  (square)  cubic 
symmetries within opinions. We had only nn connections, with equal bond 
strengths.  We  run  for  several  cases,  where  we  broke  two  neighbor  bonds 
(i.e.,  we  ignored  the  two  neighbor  bonds,  and  considered  the  other  two 
neighbor  bonds)  and  we  broke  two  opposite  bonds,  and  thirdly  we  broke 
three of the nn bonds, for various N in two- and three-dimensional lattices. 
And,  we  did  not  obtain  polarization  and  symmetry  when  we  had  any  three 
and  two  neighboring  bonds  are  broken,  i.e.,  we  obtained  polarization  and 
symmetry  whenever  two  opposite  bonds  are  broken.  Figure  5  displays 
results  for  (asymmetrically)  broken  two  neighbor  bonds  (Fig.  5a),  and 
(symmetrically) broken two opposite bonds (Fig. 5b), for N=10 at various t, 
as designated in the figure caption. 

 
 
 
Discussion  and  conclusion:  We  performed  many  runs  involving  two-dimensional 
4 
lattices with N=100 at maximum, and three-dimensional lattices with N=20 at maximum and 
detected similar observations as the ones mentioned within the previous sections. 

   We predict that these observations are independent of the distribution of initial random real 
numbers and their upper and lower bounds, yet the evolving patterns may be different. That 
is, the patterns all come out arbitrarily at different runs with fixed parameters (for number of 
tours  and  dimension)  depending  upon  the  randomness  in  Qi(t=0);  we  have  polarization  and 
symmetries emerging each time, which are independent of Qi(t=0). 
   Eqn.  (2)  is  not  conservative,  i.e.,  QT(t)≠  QT(0),  so  Qav(t)  ≠  Qav(0)  ≠Qav.  In  another  set  of 
runs, we utilized positive initial opinions (0≤Qi(0)<1.0), and obtained similar results. 

   We may define opinion as any (mathematical) quantity which evolves into regularity (with 
some symmetry properties) out of initial randomness. Within the present framework, we may 
consider  the  issue  in  the  following  way:  Let’s  define  a  finite  set  R(t=0)={ri},  composed  of 
random  real  numbers  (opinions)  a≤ri<b,  with  a,  ri,  and  b∈R,  where  R  is  the  set  of  real 
numbers.  If  O  is  any  algebraic  operator  composed  of  addition,  subtraction,  division  and 
multiplication, the set S (=OnR, and S=R(t= n)) which is obtained by n successive application 
of  O  on  R  may  involve  some  symmetries.  Please  note  that  Eqn.  (1)  defines  an  algebraic 
operator, and -1.0≤Qi(t=0)<1.0, with random Qi(t=0)∈R.

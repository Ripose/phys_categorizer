 A general physical model is presented for 1/f noise. The main questions raised by this type of noise 
can  be  solved  if  at  the  origin  of  the  phenomenon  we  consider  many  similar  like  RTN  two-state 
processes  in  co-operation  among  them  to  generate  a  Gaussian  average  process  with  1/f  power 
spectrum.  
 Even if the originating RTN processes have the same relaxation time, their co-operation produces 
in  short  times  secondary  RTN  processes  with  a  distribution  of  relaxation  times  which  generates 
again 1/f noise. 
 An extension of the model to a single two-state process viewed in "series" reveals once more the 
appearance of 1/f noise. 
 Experimental results, found in the literature, agree with this model under various aspects. 
 
 
 
1.  Introduction 
 
 Many  natural  processes  appear  with  fluctuations  whose  the  measured  power 
spectrum S(f) increases with decreasing frequency  f , approximately as 
 where  g  
is  a  positive  number  close  enough  to  one.  These  phenomena  are  related  to  the  so-
called 1/f noise also known as "flicker" noise or "pink" noise .  
 Despite  great  progress  being  made  in  1/f  noise  physics  the  source  of  these 
fluctuations  remain  unknown  in  the  case  of  most  systems  and  the  problem  remains 
largely unsolved in its generality. 
 It would be too lengthy to report all references concerning 1/f noise but an extensive 
bibliography has been drawn up in [1]. 
The principal feature of  1/f noise is that  S(f) increases with decreasing frequency  f 
down to the lowest possible frequencies for conducting measurements. This noise is 
therefore spectrally scaling that is it is statistically identical to its transformation by 
contraction  in    time,  or  another  independent  variable,  followed  by  a  corresponding 
change in intensity. This scaling property is typical of the fractals [2]. 
The aim of this contribution is to put forward an explanation to the problem based on  
a general physical mechanism which reveals the origin and essence of the effect.  
 It is common knowledge that the "intense" events are rare because they are due to the 
"coincidence" (or co-operation) of various favourable (or adverse) circumstances, so 
that  the  probability  of  occurrence,  and  then  the  frequency,  decreases  inversely  with 
the power.

Thanks to the existence, in nature, of microscopic or macroscopic two-state processes 
like random telegraph noise (RTN), we can see, on the basis of the Gaussian statistics 
intended as a limit of the binomial statistics, that  1/f noise can be generated. This is 
due to the coincidences of many similar RTN processes viewed  "in parallel" or by a 
single binary process treated "in series" on the basis of the same statistics. 
 In the following, we refer only to time phenomena.  
 
 
2. Co-operation of RTN processes and 1/f noise 
 
The  idea  that  1/f  noise  can  be  generated  by  a  superposition  of  several  RTN 
statistically  independent  processes  was  suggested  by  M.  Sourdin  to  explain  the 
"flicker effect" in a thermoionic current [3]. We recall this model here [1]. 
  In  a  RTN  process,where  the  variable  u  ranges  between  the  values  u1 and  u2, the 
power spectrum Su(w) is a Lorentzian:

where  p1  is  the  probability  of  finding  the  value  u1,  p2=1-  p1    is  the  probability of 
finding the value u2 and t is the "relaxation time" (the average time spent in each state 
before  making  a  transition  to  another  state,  or  the  inverse  of  the  total  rate  of 
transitions, back and forth, in the process).   
 The term (u1 - u2 )2 p1 p2 of equation (1) represents the variance of the process [1]. 
In the  case of a superposition of many RTN processes with a continuous distribution 
of  relaxation  times,  Su(w)  has  to  be  averaged  over  this  distribution  with  a  weight 
function p(t)dt which includes the contribution to the variance of  processes whose 
relaxation times lie in the interval from t to t +dt. In practice

 As this model requires a continuous distribution of relaxation times on a wide range, 
it is hard to explain physically  the origin of such distribution for a large diversity of 
systems.  
 A different approach to the problem is possible considering the "coincidences" which 
appear in the superposition of many RTN processes with about the same probability 
of  occurrence  and  the same relaxation time  tmin  .  These coincidences correspond to 
the number of contemporary high (or low) levels which appear during a time tmin .

 The statistics which governs the probability  P(c)  of  the  number  of  coincidences  is 
the  Gaussian  distribution  of  probability,  for  we  are  in  a  situation    of  binomial 
distribution with a large number of attempts and a probability  p for the events which 
is not very small. In our case the number of attempts corresponds to the number of 
involved primary RTN processes.  
 Consequently we can write:

 Du2 of equation (7) represents the average power of the Gaussian process concerning 
the probability  P(Du).    This  average  power  seen  in  the  time-domain  is  due  to  the 
concourse of a precise number of originating RTN processes which coincide in time 
tmin and generate fluctuation Du.

 The  law  of  large  numbers  allows  us  to  introduce  an  average  frequency  f  of  the 
outcomes,  proportional  to  their  probabilities  of  occurrence,  thereby  enabling  us  to 
substitute P(Du) with f  in equation (7).  We can conceive

 It is important to note that in this context we tacitly admit that tmin also represents the 
maximum time employed for one measurement. In this sense the process is analysed 
in its intrinsic time-scale. 
 The power Du2 of equation (9) represents the maximum power of the deterministic 
process of frequency  f  to which the Gaussian probabilistic process converges when 
we consider its average behaviour. On the other hand Du2 is also an average power in 
the time interval tmin.

 Various  components  of  different  frequency  will  generate 
Components with a frequency lower than  f  are  not  possible  because  this  process  is 
periodical and it can be expanded by a Fourier series whose fundamental frequency is 
just f. The maximum frequency of these components will be the maximum frequency 
of the process, that is  the fmax of the relationship (8).  
 Subsequently,  in  the  hypothesis  of  a  large  number  of  RTN  "fluctuators"  and 
introducing the power spectrum Su(f), we have:

Gaussian behaviour and 1/f noise observed in a sufficiently pure form. 
 
 
3.  Filtering effects  
 
 If  the time employed for one measurement of Du is Dt >tmin and Du is sampled with 
frequency  1/Dt,  thus  the  generating  processes  do  not  appear  as  pure  RTNs.  In  any 
case,  these  processes  have  the  same  probability  distribution  so  their  summation 
always has a Gaussian distribution thanks to the central limit theorem. 
 Applying the law of large numbers the frequency of the fluctuation Du will be:

 Du2  of  equation  (14)  denotes  the  maximum  power  of  the  deterministic  process  of 
frequency f* to which the Gaussian probabilistic process converges when we consider 
its average behaviour for a long time.  
 Now, Du2 represents an average power in the time interval  Dt and will be generated 
in the frequency-domain by spectral components with a frequency which ranges from 
the minimum f* (Du is related to a periodical process of frequency f*) to the maximum 
fmax as reported in the equation (8). 
Thus, in the hypothesis of a large number of "fluctuators" and introducing the power 
spectrum Su(f)  we have:

 From another point  of  view,  the  sampling  of  the  variable  Du  by  a  time  interval Dt 
(repeated with a frequency  1/Dt) filters the power spectrum  1/f  by a  sinc2 operator 
[7], that is

4.  Distribution of relaxation times and 1/f noise 
 
 The  1/f  process  can  be  decomposed  for  short  times  even  in  secondary  RTN 
processes. These secondary processes will have the amplitude du = Dui - Dui-1 = const 
for every  i , being as  Dui is the fluctuation of  u corresponding to the fluctuation  Dci . 
So,  to  each  fluctuation  Dci  will  correspond  one  secondary  RTN  process  whose 
relaxation time t will be related to the average frequency of Dci  (in practice t = 1/2f). 
 The power spectrum of these secondary RTN processes will be:

where du2p1(t)p2(t) is the variance of  the process.  
  Necessarily,      Su(w)  =  St  Su,t(w)  and  we  can  demonstrate  St  Su,t(w)  (cid:181)  1/w  by 
operating in the same manner as paragraph 2. 
 In fact, in the case of a continuous distribution of the relaxation times  Su,t(w) has to 
be  averaged  by  a  weight  function  p(t)dt  which  includes  the  contribution  to  the 
variance of  processes whose relaxation times lie in the interval from t to t +dt.  
 We  can  suppose  p(t)(cid:181)1/t,  thereby  obtaining  the  power  spectrum  of  the  resulting 
process by integrating Su,t(w) within the interval  tmin,t , that is  
 
                                                     Su(w) (cid:181) 1/w        ,                                  (18)

 In conclusion, the distribution of the RTN processes which determines the  1/f noise 
is  not  only  a  mathematical  point  of  curiosity,  but  it  is  precisely  the  physical 
consequence of the interaction of similar originating RTN processes which forces the 
process to have a 1/f power spectrum, even for short times.  
 
5. Dependence of 1/f noise on mean voltage or current 
 
  As  we  know,  in  uniform  conductors  the  voltage  power  spectrum  of  1/f  noise  is 
proportional  to  the  square  of  the  steady  current  flowing  through  the  sample  or  the 
mean  voltage  <V >  across  the  same  sample  in  the  region  in  which  Ohm's  law  is 
obeyed. 
 These relations have been verified many times on various conductors. For instance, 
they were verified for continuous metal films by Voss & Clarke [5].  These authors 
have  also  proved  [6]  that  the  resistance  R  fluctuates  under  conditions  of  thermal 
equilibrium, so establishing that the fluctuation is not caused by the current flow. 
 In our case the variable  u can be intended as the resistance  R. In fact, M. Sourdin 
hypothesised that the fluctuation of the thermoionic current is due to fluctuations of 
resistance stemming from fluctuations of a number of free electrons on the metal [3]. 

 

6 

These  fluctuations  are  interpreted  as  the  collective  action  of  various  microscopic 
RTN processes such as trapping and detrapping of conduction electrons. 
Therefore the equation (12) can become: 
 
                                                       SR(f) (cid:181) sR
 
 It can be demonstrated using a simple model [7] that:

where N  is the number of charge carriers in the sample. 
If a steady current  I flows through the resistance  R, we can multiply per  I  2 the first 
and the second term of relation (19).  Therefore, by also using the equation (20), we 
have: 
                                     

                                               SV(f) (cid:181)

 The last term of equation (21) is just the Hooge empirical formula [8]. 
 These  results  confirm  that  the  equation  (12)  and  the  hypothesis  of  the  resistance 
fluctuations are functional to deduce the relations (21). 
 
6. 
 
 If    pure  1/f  noise  is  generated  by  a  Gaussian  process  then  the  form 
  can  be 
ascribed  to  a  quasi-Gaussian  behaviour.  In  other  words,  our  process  can  be  better 
described at low frequencies by a modification of the Gaussian expression (5) as:

7.  1/f noise on 1/f noise 
 
 Experimental results due to  C.E.Parman et al. [9] and P.J. Restle et al. [12] reveal 
"second  spectra"  on  the  1/f  noise  power  spectrum,  which  themselves  have  1/f  
behaviour. 
 It is possible to explain this result if we accept that these fluctuations are due to the 
Lorentzians with different relaxation times which generate the 1/f power spectrum for 
short times. In fact, the power spectrum S2(w) of these fluctutions will be:

where  k  and  kt  are  a  suitable  constant  of  proportionality  and  the  summation  St    is 
intended on all the Lorentzians which generate the 1/f power spectrum. 
 Looking to equation (26), if w  >>1 then S2(w) ?  0 , and  when w  <<1 then S2(w) ?  
k/w   + const  as it is expected . 
 
8. White noise limit at low frequency 
 
 Su(w) exhibits a white spectrum when the number of the primary RTN processes is 
limited to such an extent as to enable the reaching of the inferior limit of frequency 
for the 1/f noise within the time scale of the measurements.   
 In fact, if  tmax   is the maximum relaxation time of the Lorentzians generated by the 
primary  RTN  processes  then  for  w  <<1/tmax    Su(w)  ﬁ const  [1][3].  This  result  is 
clearly confirmed when we look to the Lorentzians with the relaxation time less than 
tmax  and, consequently, also to their summation. 
 Experimental evidence of this behaviour is reported in reference [13] when the flow 
of tiny grains in a hourglass is analysed, or in reference [4] where the flattening at the 
low frequencies of power spectra relating to 1/f noise sources appears.

9.  Gaussian noise without 1/f noise 
 
 If  the  generating  processes  are  not  RTNs  but  operate  with  the  same  probability 
distribution, the resulting distribution of the  Du is once again Gaussian (central limit 
theorem). Thanks to the  law  of  large  numbers,  even  in this case the fluctuation  Du 
will converge in an average process of frequency f*.   
 This frequency f* cannot be defined as in equation (8) because now a relaxation time 
does  not  exist.  Instead,  we  can  introduce  a  frequency  of  Du  if  we  look  to  the  time 
interval Dt adopted to perform the measurements, that is

where P(Du) and P(Du)max have the known meaning. 
 Each power  Du2 is an average power in the time interval  Dt and relates to a process 
of frequency  f*.    This  power  Du2  will  have  spectral  components  with  a  frequency 
greater  than  f*  thanks  to  the  Fourier  theorem  but  the  maximum  frequency  of  these 
components cannot be f*max of relationship (27).  In fact, f*max depends on Dt while the 
measurement  of  Du2  in  the  frequency-domain  involves  the  spectral  components 
determined  by  the  co-operation  of  the  generating  processes  which  have  their  own 
frequencies independently of Dt. 
 Therefore,  in  general  the  power  spectrum  Su,Dt(f)  which  generates  Du2  must  be 
integrated  from  f*  to  a  frequency  fmax  different  from  f*max  .  In  practice,  fmax 
corresponds to the bandwidth of the generating processes. Therefore

  The  consequence  of  relationship  (28)  is  that  the  equation  (11)  cannot  be  used,  so 
pure 1/f noise is not generated.  
 On the other hand, the structure composed of Lorentzians of the same amplitude and 
with a distribution of relaxation times which produce 1/f noise cannot appear for short 
times if the generating processes are not RTNs. So, also from this point of view, the 
1/f noise is precluded 
Therefore, a Gaussian noise can exist without necessarily being a 1/f noise (e.g. white 
noise). 
 Concerning the filtering effects we have similar result to equation (16)

 10.  Serial 1/f noise 
 
 A single two-state process is very common in nature, for example the sequential flow 
along the same path of identical objects such as electrons, photons, cars, etc.  
 If  Dt  is  the  minimum  time  necessary  to  detect  one  object  which  flows    through  a 
cross-section of the path, N = 1/Dt  represents the average number of attempts to find 
the object in the time unit.  
 If p is the probability of detecting one of these objects in time Dt then the probability 
P(n) to detect n objects in unit time will follow the binomial distribution. 
 When N is large and the probability p is not very small, P(n) will become a Gaussian 
distribution, so

where  n   denotes  the  mean  value  of  n  and  sn  the  standard  deviation  of  the

 Solving equation (30) in the unknown Dn2 = (n-<n>)2, we obtain

where P(Dn)= P(n), sDn=sn  and P(Dn)max = 

 Thanks to the  law of large numbers, the mean  frequency f of the fluctuations  D n is 
proportional to their probabilities and therefore we can substitute P(n) with f . In fact 
f = P(Dn) / Dt  and fmax= P(Dn)max/Dt. 
 Dn2  represents    the  maximum  power  of  the  process  of  frequency  f whose spectral 
components have frequencies at the range of f,fmax .  
Thus, introducing the power spectrum Sn(f) we can  write:

11. Correlations of the 1/f noise 
 
 The mean  <c> of the number of coincidences of  N similar RTN  processes which 
co-operate  to  produce  1/f  noise,  or  the  mean  <n>  of the number of objects which 
flow sequentially in the unity of time, when N is the frequency of the attempts, is: 
 
                                     <c> = Np      or      <n> = Np ,                               (35) 
 
where p is the occurrence probability of the events.  
If q represents the probability of not finding the event in an attempt : 
  
            sDu
 
 Thus, thank to equations (12) (34) and (36) : 
 
        Su(f) (cid:181) <c> q /f = Npq/f        and          Sn(f) (cid:181) <n> q /f = Npq/f.       (37) 
 
 This result tells us that the power spectrum of the 1/f noise can fluctuate in time if 
<c> and <n> fluctuate, too.  Fluctuations of <c> can be originated by fluctuations of 
N and/or  p  while  in  the  case  of  the  sequential  process  only  fluctuations  of  p  can 
determine fluctuations of Sn(f), N  being steady "a priori". 
 On the basis of these considerations the fluctuations of Su(f) or Sn(f) in a given octave 
(or  decade)  are  necessarily  correlated  to  the  fluctuations  of  the  1/f  noise  power 
spectrum in other octaves (or decades). 
  Experiments, performed on n-type doped hydrogenated  amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) 
samples confirm that slow variations of the  1/f  noise  are  strongly  correlated  over  a 
broad  range  of  frequencies  [9].  In  fact,  these  experimental  results  show  that  strong 
correlations  of  the  average  noise  power  as  a  function  of  time  appear  between  the 
differing octaves.  
  The  existence  of  co-operative  dynamics  among  the  spectral  components  of  noise 
power has also been observed in mesoscopically small CuMn spin glasses [10] and in 
simulations of kinetic Ising models [11]. 
 
12.  Conclusions 
 
  In this paper it has been demonstrated that  1/f  noise  appears  when  a  co-operation 
exists among many and similar RTN processes or when a single binary process (e.g. 
the sequential flow of identical objects) operates with the same statistics.  
    In fact,  thanks to the  law of the large numbers applied to the Gaussian distribution 
of the resulting variable, this co-operative process can be conceived on average as a 
summation of spectral components which generate a 1/f power spectrum.  
 Moreover, secondary  RTN  processes  can  be  viewed  in  the  process  for  short  times 
with  such  a  distribution  of  relaxation  times  that  their  summation  produces  1/f noise 
again. 

 

11 

 On the other hand, Gaussian noise can exist without necessarily being 1/f noise if the 
similar originating processes are not RTNs. 
Various experimental results found in the literature are compatible with this model. 
  At  least  the  so-called paradox of the  1/f  noise  (the  spectral  density  increases  with 
decreasing frequency f as far down as it is possible to conduct measurements) arrives 
at an easy explanation. In fact, if we suppose, as an example, one hundred two-state 
fluctuators  each  having  equal  appearance  probability  in  the  two  states  and  a 
relaxation time of 1 m s, the probability of a coincidence (during one microsecond) of 
all hundred RTN processes corresponds on average to one possibility in about every 
2·109 years (the retained age of our Universe).

Golden Bars of Consensus and the Truth Quark

Scientists are imprisoned by Golden Bars of Consensus, says Burton Richter. 

A case in point is the mass of the Truth Quark. 

The consensus analysis of the experimental data indicates that 

the mass of the Truth Quark is about 170 GeV. 

On the other hand, an alternative analysis of the same date indicates that 

the mass of the Truth Quark is about 130 GeV. 

If the design of future experiments takes into account only the consensus value, 

then results of future experiments might be compromised. 

Burton Richter, in remarks at Stanford in 1999 (hep-ex/0001012) said "... The next big machine, the LHC, is under construction 
at CERN ... The two main experiments ATLAS and CMS will each have 1500 to 2000 collaborators. ... In the 500-strong
collaborations of today, we already have a bureaucratic overlay to the science with committees that decide on the trigger, 
data analysis procedures, error analysis, speakers, paper publications, etc. The participating scientists are imprisoned by 

golden bars of consensus

.... this will become more difficult as the collaborations grow to three times the size of today's largest. This needs thinking 
about and talking about, ...". Do the golden bars of consensus already imprison useful data and analysis? Consider, as an
example, the

mass of the T-quark.

Truth Ceng Zi

In April 1994, CDF at Fermilab (in FERMILAB-PUB-94/097-E) reported a T-quark mass 
of 174 (+/-10)(+13/-12) GeV. The data analyzed by CDF included the 26-event histogram 
shown above 
( It is Figure 65 of the report. I have added blue and green colors to make discussion easier. )
for W + (3 or more) jets, without b-tags. 

Some of the CDF histogram events, shown in blue, are in the 150-190 GeV range and do 
support the CDF analysis. However, there is a peak of 8 events in the 140-150 GeV bin, 
shown in green, that were excluded from the analysis by CDF, saying (on page 140 of the 
report) "... the bin with masses between 140 and 150 GeV/c^2 has eight events. 

We assume the mass combinations in the 140 to 150 GeV/c^2 bin represent a statistical

fluctuation since their width is narrower than expected for a top signal. ...". 

If the 140-150 GeV peak were only a statistical fluctuation seen by the CDF detector, one 
would not expect to find such a peak repeated in the data seen by the D0 detector at 
Fermilab.

However, 

in March 1997, D0 (in hep-ex/9703008) reported a T-quark mass of 173.3 GeV (+/- 5.6 
stat +/- 6.2 syst), 

based on data including a histogram similar to Figure 65 of the April 1994 CDF report 
which is Figure 3 of the D0 report, to which I have added blue and green colors to make
discussion easier:

Some of the D0 histogram events, shown in blue, are are in the 150-190 GeV range and do 
support the CDF analysis.

However, 

similar to the 140-150 GeV bin peak seen and thrown out by CDF, 

there is a peak of 5 events in the 130-140 GeV bin, shown in green,

that were excluded from the analysis by D0. I did not see in the D0 report an explicit 
discussion of the 5-event peak in the 130-140 GeV bin. 

Those 130-150 GeV peaks are from untagged semileptonic events. 

Tagged semileptonic events may be a more reliable measure of T-quark mass, although 

there are fewer of them, so that statistics are not as good.

CDF (in hep-ex/9801014, dated 30 September 1997) reported a T-quark mass of 175.9 +/- 
4.8(stat.) +/- 4.9(syst.) GeV based on events that were either SVX tagged, SVX double 
tagged, or untagged. However, CDF analysis of tagged semileptonic events (14 of them) 
gave a T-quark Mass of 142 GeV (+33, -14), as shown in their Figure 2, which is a plot of 
events/10 GeV bin vs. Reconstructed Mass in GeV: 

D0 (in hep-ex/9801025) also analyzed tagged semileptonic events, with the result shown in 
their figure 25:

The figure shows 3 events in the 130-150 GeV range, one event in the 170-180 GeV bin, 
and one event in the 200-210 GeV bin. According to footnote 10 of hep-ex/9801025, 

One event which would have otherwise passed the cuts, event (95653; 10822), was
removed by D0 from its analysis because it was selected by the dilepton mass analysis. If 
this event is treated as a l + jets candidate, 

it has a fit Chi-squared of 0.92 and fitted Truth Quark mass of 138.7 GeV.

Dilepton events may be the most reliable measure of T-quark mass, although they are the 

least numerous type of event, so that statistics are not so good. 

 

In October 1998 (in hep-ex/9810029) CDF analyzed 8 dilepton events and reported a T-
quark mass of 167.4 +/- 10.3(stat) +/- 4.8(syst) GeV. Figure 2 of the report shows the 8 
events:

I have colored green the events with T-quark mass less than 160 GeV, and blue the events 
with T-quark mass greater than 160 GeV. The hep-ex/9810029 CDF report stated that it "... 
supersedes our previously reported result in the dilepton channel ...".

 

The superseded previous CDF dilepton report (hep-ex/9802017) analyzed 9 events out of a 
total of 11 events, which 11 events are shown on the following histogram:

I have colored green the events with T-quark mass less than 150 GeV, and blue the events 
with T-quark mass greater than 150 GeV. 

Note first, that in the earlier 11-event histogram 5 events are shown as greater than 150 
GeV, but only 4 events are shown as greater than 160 GeV, while in the 8-event revised 
histogram 5 events are shown as greater than 160 GeV. This indicates to me that some 
changes in the analysis have shifted the event mass assignments upward by about 10 GeV. 

Note second, that the earlier 11-event histogram contains 3 events from 120-140 GeV that 
are omitted from the 8-event revised histogram. 

 

D0 (in hep-ex/9706014 and hep-ex/9808029) has analyzed 6 dilepton events, reporting a 
T-quark mass of about 168.4 GeV. The 1997 UC Berkeley PhD thesis of Erich Ward 
Varnes which can be found on the web at http://wwwd0.fnal.gov/publications_talks/thesis/
thesis.html contains details of the events and the D0 analyses. Each of the 6 events has its 
own characteristics. In this letter I will only discuss one of them, Run 84676 Event 12814, 
an electron-muon dilepton event. This figure

from page 159 of the Varnes thesis, shows a T-quark mass likelihood plot calculated by the 
neutrino weighting algorithm.

In this event there were 3 jets instead of the 2 jets you would normally expect in a Dilepton 

event.

The solid line is the plot if all 3 jets are included, and the dashed line is the plot if only 2 
of the jets are included by excluding the third (lowest transverse energy) jet.

The 3-jet interpretation supports the 170 GeV mass favored by the Fermilab consensus, 

while 

the 2-jet interpretation supports a 130-140 GeV mass analysis that may be imprisoned by 

the golden bars of Fermilab consensus. 

 

 

Could the golden bars of consensus do any real harm to physics ?

 

Consider the work going on now in planning experiments to be 

done on future machines, such as the LHC.

A recent paper (hep-ph/0002205), The Standard Model Instability and the Scale of New 
Physics, by J.A. Casas, V. Di Clemente and M. Quiros, concludes that "... with the present 
lower bounds on the Higgs mass, 

the new physics could easily (but not necessarily) escape detection in the present and future 

accelerators. ...".

They state "...In this paper we will fix Mt to its experimental mean value and disregard the 
effect due to the experimental error delta_Mt. ...". 

If Fermilab had not bound Casas, Di Clemente, and Quiros within the golden bars of 
consensus of T-quark mass Mt at about 175 GeV, then their paper might have included 

effects of different values of Mt. 

In other words,

restriction of consideration of T-quark masses to around 175 GeV could produce a much 

more pessimistic view of the likelihood of success of new physics searches at LHC, 

while breaking the golden bars of consensus to give freedom to consideration of T-quark 
masses well below 175 GeV produces a much more optimistic view of the likelihood of 
success of new physics searches at LHC. 

 

Although the economies contributing to the LHC are now prosperous enough to say that it 
will be built, things can change (and, as was the case for the SSC, not always for the 
better). Therefore, 

I don't think that it is a good idea to imprison ideas that can lead to optimism about the 

potential for discovery at the LHC. 

 

Since the T-quark is a key part of the truth of nature that physics seeks to understand, 

I prefer to call it the Truth quark

(although I realize that now I am in a tiny minority, as most now call it Top).

How are the Golden Bonds of Consensus related to my D4-D5-E6-E7 physics model ?

If the Truth quark mass is about 130 GeV, it is consistent with the prediction of my D4-D5-E6-E7 physics model made in 1984, 
shown as the dark blue line:

My D4-D5-E6-E7 physics model prediction was made before CERN announced in 1984 the "discovery" of the Truth quark 
with mass 40 GeV, shown as purple, and that during the time that the CERN announcement was generally considered to be 
valid, I still maintained that CERN was wrong and that my prediction was right. My D4-D5-E6-E7 physics model prediction
was consistent with the ARGUS indirect B-Bbar experimental determination, shown as gold; and with the Dalitz-Goldstein 
analysis of 1988-89 CDF events, shown in red. The green bar represents my analysis of Fermilab's Run 1, and the cyan bar 
represents Fermilab's analysis of that data. What about indirect ElectroWeak determinations ?

If the 170-180 GeV peak is not the Truth quark, then what is it ?  

I don't know for sure, but maybe it is poorly understood background, perhaps related to miscounting the 
number of jets associated with events, and/or perhaps related to some phenomena seen at HERA and CERN.

According to hep-ex/9910012 by the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations at HERA: "...Between mid-1994 and the 
end of 1997 the electron-proton collider HERA at DESY has been operated ... . In this period, ZEUS and H1 
have collected e + p data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of 47.7 pb^(-1) and 37 pb^(-1), 
respectively. In 1998 and the first half of 1999, each experiment has taken about 15 pb^(-1) of ... data ... The 
excess in the H1 data is still present at Me = 200 GeV but has not been corroborated by the 1997 data. Also
ZEUS observes an excess at Mej > 200 GeV; however, the decay angular distribution does not support a LQ 
interpretation ...

The data in the 175 GeV region is consistent with 4 generations of neutrinos, rather than 3, also indicating to 

me that processes in that region are incompletely understood.

The first paper I ever put on the Los Alamos e-print archive, hep-ph/9301210 - Calculation of 130 GeV Mass for T-Quark, was 

at MENTOR.LANL.GOV for years:

A few people, including me, who like the concepts of Truth and Beauty, still call the T-Quark the Truth Quark 

instead of the Top Quark.

Truth Ceng Zi

, because Ceng Zi means quark in the language of the physicist who first proposed

.

Liu Yao-Yang Around 1960, he invented the Ceng Zi (quark) model of particle physics. He was working at the 

I also call it 
it,
University of Science and Technology of China, which was then located at Beijing, when he invented the Ceng Zi model. He 
wrote a paper and submitted it to a Chinese journal. It was turned down because the editors thought the paper was not 
correct. After the quark model had been independently re-invented around 1962-1964, with most of the credit going to Murray
Gell-Mann, the editors apologized for rejecting the paper. Liu Yao-Yang is, the last that I heard, still working at the University
of Science and Technology of China, which is now at Anhui, in the fields of atomic and molecular physics, quantum field 
theory, and quantization of gravity.

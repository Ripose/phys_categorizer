1. Introduction 

The high-pressure sodium-mercury vapor discharge lamp was invented 40 years ago [1], and 

further developed and refined during the next two decades [2]. It is a wall-stabilized electric arc 

burning at elevated pressure and temperature in mercury-sodium plasma. The lamp burner is 

made of a high–density polycrystalline alumina ceramics (PCA), a material highly resistant to hot 

and corrosive sodium vapor up to 1800K. Despite of its high transmission coefficient (> 90% for 

visible radiation), a disadvantage of PCA is that it is not transparent but translucent material. 

Consequently, conventional plasma diagnostic techniques for determination of various plasma 

parameters are not easily applicable to this radiation source. 

Optical and electrical features of the high-pressure sodium discharge lamp based on the 

standard sodium-mercury-xenon filling, have been widely investigated [2]. A similar discharge, 

based on sodium-cadmium-xenon filling, has been studied so far in order to find out origin of 

continuous bands in visible part of the spectrum of NaHg, KHg and NaCd molecules [3, 4], but 

plasma parameters of NaCd discharge have been rarely investigated [5]. Yet, these data are 

desirable for a more complete understanding of the physics and chemistry of all high-pressure 

discharges containing sodium and IIB group elements (Zn, Cd, Hg). This general knowledge about 

plasma generated in a vapor mixture of sodium and IIB group elements is important for a possible 

(ecological) upgrade to a high-pressure mercury-free discharge lamp based on the sodium-zinc 

filling [6]. Attractive candidates for determination of electron density and temperature in such 

plasmas are higher-lying sodium excited states (belonging to nS and mD series) with large Stark-

shifts and Stark-widths and small oscillator strengths. Theoretical Stark-broadening data on sodium

transitions are given by Griem's [7, 8] and Dimitrijevic [9] calculations. 

Experimental data are rather scarce. By our knowledge there is an older measurement of electron 

density in Na-Hg-Xe discharge using Stark-shifts of

 spectral lines in a Na-Ar pulsed discharge are published [11]. The accompanied 

calculations of these line-shifts [11]  made in the random-phase approximation (RPA) agree with 

existing Stark-shift calculations [7, 8, 9]. Mutual agreement between theories [9] and [11], and 

experiment [11] is especially good in the case of the  7

data are compared with the available experimental [10, 11] and theoretical data [7, 8, 9, 11]. The 

observed line shapes are compared with the calculated line shapes obtained using Bartels’ method 

[12].  

 

 

2. Line-shape calculations 

2.1. Broadening mechanisms  

The spectral line profiles of sodium nS-3P and mD-3P transitions radiated by excited sodium 

atoms in a high pressure arc discharge are influenced by two main broadening mechanisms: the 

Stark broadening (by electrons) and the van der Waals broadening (by dissimilar atoms) [7, 13]. 

The resonance broadening (by similar atoms) and the Doppler broadening are practically negligible 

under our experimental conditions [7, 14]. However, the dominant shift and broadening mechanism 

in this experiment is the Stark broadening by electrons, as it will be justified later. 

The shape of an atomic line can be calculated in two different approximations, impact and 

quasistatic, corresponding to two different interaction pictures. However, the application of the 

impact or the quasistatic approximations yields very different line shapes [7].  The quasistatic 

approximation yields the following line profile [14]:

According to Kielkopf [18] and Stormberg [13], the total line profile can be successfully 

simulated by convoluting the impact line profile and the quasistatic line profile:

The convolution integral gives a line profile expressed in a complicated but analytical form that can 

be rapidly calculated [19]. The resultant synthetic line profile describes simultaneously the line core 

and the line wings. This empirical approach has been suggested long time ago by Margenau [20], 

Hindmarsh et al [21], Kielkopf et al [18], and recently by Stormberg [13]. However, whereas this 

approach is mathematically correct, it can be questioned from the physical point of view. It 

suggests that we can convolute two broadening mechanisms that are rigorously limited: one to the 

line core (giving the impact line profile), and the other one to the line wing (delivering the 

quasistatic line profile). This is certainly not true [8], but justification for the application of this 

synthetic profile and its popularity in line shape analysis [22-24], comes from the fact that it 

smoothly and correctly describes the complete line shape, behaving as a Lorentzian in the line 

core and in the blue line wing, and as an exponential in the red line wing. After Stormberg [13] 

several authors successfully applied this approach to the analysis of the shape of atomic lines 

radiated by various high-pressure discharges (sodium lines in high-pressure sodium and metal-

halide discharges [16, 22, 23], and mercury lines in high-pressure mercury discharge [24]). In this 

work the line profiles were calculated by the line shape function 

TP λ∆ and the synthetic line

shape was used in Bartels’ method to obtain the true line shape emitted by the discharge.

2.2. Bartels' method 

[13] 

[14] 

[15] 

[16] 

This method [25], is based on the assumptions that the axially symmetric plasma is in local 

thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the equation of state for ideal gas fulfilled, the partial pressure of 

the emitting atoms constant throughout the plasma column, and that the depletion of the ground 

state population due to excitation and ionisation can be neglected.  

The population of an excited atomic state is then given by the Boltzmann equation:

3. Experimental setup 

The experimental arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. The measurements have been performed using 

400 W NaCd and NaHg high pressure discharges (with translucent sapphire burner) in series with 

a 400 W inductive choke. The inner diameter, the outer diameter and the length of the sapphire 

burner are 7.6 mm, 9 mm and 110 mm, respectively. The tips of the electrodes are separated 95 

mm. The discharge was operated vertically, driven by a standard 50 Hz AC line source, with a 

discharge current between 3 A and 4.2 A for the NaCd , and between 2.6 A and 4A for the NaHg  

high-pressure lamp. The burner contains a sodium–cadmium (or sodium-mercury) amalgam. 

Partial pressure of sodium and cadmium (or mercury) during lamp operation is determined by the 

temperature of the coldest spot of the burner [26]. The central region of the burner was imaged 

onto the entrance slit of a medium-resolution monochromator (“K. Zeiss”, model SPM-2, 10 µm 

wide slits). The magnification ratio was approximately 1:1. The light from the discharge, spectrally 

resolved by the monochromator, was detected using an EMI 9558QB photomultiplier. A linear 

amplifier (Keithley electrometer, M611) with a low-pass electronic filter for the suppression of high-

frequency noise has been used for signal amplification.  

Signal is processed by a box-car averager equipped with a gated integrator, operated either 

in external- or in line-triggering mode as illustrated in Fig. 2.  The current reversal point is the 

reference time instant and the origin of the trigger. The trigger signal can be derived either by 

monitoring the integral light signal by a photodiode, or by monitoring the AC current. This technique 

enables sampling out the spectrum of plasma radiation at any desirable phase of the AC current. In 

this experiment we performed all the measurements using the aperture duration time of 50 µs, and 

the aperture delay time of 5 ms (at the current maximum). The processed data have been 

converted by a 14-bit A/D converter, and stored in a computer for further analysis. 

Calibration of the monochromator wavelength scale is provided by low-pressure sodium 

and mercury lamps. The shift of spectral lines radiated by the low-pressure plasma can be 

neglected in this case. 

4. Plasma diagnostics and reduction of data 

To enable comparison of our data with the results of earlier experiments [10, 11] and with 

calculations of Stark-widths and Stark-shifts made under assumption of LTE   [7, 8, 9, 11] we have 

to check validity of LTE approximation in our AC driven arc discharge. Here we will show that our 

7

Miokovic et al 

discharge satisfies all validity criteria for assumption of LTE, and that the data may be compared to 

data measured in previous experiments. 

 

In the experiment [10] authors measured Stark-widths and Stark-shifts on  5

emission lines from a NaHg arc burning in a tube made of clear sapphire (electrode 

separation 8.6 cm, internal diameter 7.6 mm). The arc was operated with a switching DC power 

source, with 80 ms switching time. The measured electron densities in the core of the arc were 

about 1x10

21 m-3, justifying the assumption of LTE in their measurements. In the recent experiment 

[11] authors measured Stark-shifts on  7

 lines from a Na-Ar 

arc burning in a clear sapphire tube (electrode separation 7.6 cm, internal diameter 4.8 mm). The 

arc was operated in a simmer-mode, powered with rectangular current pulses of 1 ms duration 

[11]. Electron densities in the core of the arc were measured as high as 1x10

23 m-3, justifying the 

assumption of LTE in their measurements, too. The electron density range, the core arc 

temperature and the density of neutral atoms in these discharges are very similar to our 

experimental conditions. 

 

A comprehensive discussion of validity criteria for assumption of LTE can be found in [7]. In 

case of stationary plasma, for complete LTE down to the ground state, the collision excitation rate 

must be much larger than the radiative excitation or de-excitation rate even for the first excited 

state. Since the resonance lines of the main discharge constituent (neutral mercury or cadmium) 

are self-absorbed, the condition for validity of LTE requires ([7], Eq. 6-60):

where the symbols have the same meaning as in the reference. This condition requires rather high 

electron densities, but can be reduced for an order of magnitude if the product of ground state 

atom density , N1, and the discharge diameter, d, is high enough ([7], Eq. 6-64):

where f12 denotes the resonance line oscillator strength, λ12 is the wavelength of the line, and A

Eq. [17] may be safely relaxed for an order of magnitude:

, 

which for neutral mercury or cadmium (the most stringent requirement) becomes Ne > 7*1020 m-3.  

This basic requirement for validity of LTE is always satisfied in our measurements since in all 
experiments the line widths and shifts are determined at Ne ≥ 1*1021 m-3. However, to prove validity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8

Miokovic et al 

of LTE one must additionally check whether the kinetic temperatures of atoms and ions are equal 

to the electron temperature. This condition is given as ([7], Eq. 6-75):

, 

where E is the applied electric field, and the other symbols have the same meaning as in the 

reference. Since this condition is satisfied we can expect that the temperatures of heavy particles 

are equal to electron temperature to within ±2% [7]. 

Since our discharge is AC operated, and data sampled at each current maximum point with 

50 µs aperture duration (see Fig. 2.) we also have to check the validity of LTE in the case of time-

dependent plasmas. Theory requires that the time necessary for equilibration between atomic 

states be less then a typical time for a 10% variation in plasma conditions during that period in 

which we make the measurement. The time required for equilibration between states with quantum 

numbers n and n+1 is given as ([7], Eq. 6-67):

where the symbols have the meaning as in the reference [7]. For the ground state and the first 

excited state of neutral mercury (or cadmium), what is again the most stringent requirement, this 

formula yields tcrit =  60 µs. Since typical time allowed for plasma variation in our experiment is 

50µs (aperture duration time) this condition is barely satisfied for resonance levels of neutral 

mercury (or cadmium), but it is entirely satisfied for all higher atomic states of all constituents of our 

plasmas. 

Finally, we have to check conditions of validity of the isolated line approximation [7] for the 

sodium lines of interest. Generally, at lower electron densities the line shifts due to quadratic Stark 

effect are proportional to electron density. Experiments in dense plasmas, made at higher electron 

densities, show deviations from this linear behaviour. The determination of the electron density at 

which the deviation from linearity can start is very important since it establishes range of validity of 

the isolated line approximation. By definition, [7, 9], a line can be regarded as isolated if its initial 

and final (non-degenerate) energy levels Ei and Ef broadened by electron collisions do not overlap,

even lower, 4*1021 m-3, suggesting that these two lines could not be regarded as completely

 sodium lines, and in the 

discharge parameter range of interest (3800 K ≤ Te ≤ 4100 K, 6*1021 < Ne < 1*1022 m-3, 1*1023 < 
NNa < 4*1023 m-3, 5*1023 < NX < 2.5*1024 m-3, where “X” stands for Cd and Hg) the Stark broadening 

dominates over van der Waals broadening. That statement can be proved by inserting appropriate 

interaction constants, plasma parameters and other experimental data in the equations [2] – [11]. 

To demonstrate it, we can use the data on the 6S-3P line measured in NaHg and NaCd  
discharges at an electron density of about 9*1015 cm-3.  The corresponding discharge temperature 

is determined to be 3800 K in NaHg and 3900 K in NaCd  discharge. The mean relative velocity of 
Na-Hg (or Na-Cd) atomic pair at this temperature is about  2*103 m/s. An average density of 
ground state mercury (or cadmium) atoms at this temperature is about 2*1024  m-3, and an average 
ground state sodium atom density is about 3*1023 m-3.  The static polarizability  of mercury atoms is  

34.4 a.u., and 49.7 a.u. for cadmium atoms [15, 16]. The corresponding effective C6 constant for 
Na*-Hg pair is about 4*10-29 s-1 cm6, and for Na*-Cd pair is about 5*10-29 s-1 cm6.  These values lead 

to an impact line-shift (caused by Cd or Hg perturbers) of about 0.006 nm , and to a displacement 

(also caused by Cd or Hg perturbers) of the quasistatic profile of about 0.00025 nm. The 

corresponding typical line-broadening values are about 0.017 nm for the impact line-width, and 

about 0.0005 nm for the characteristic width of the quasistatic profile. Furthermore, the Na(6S) - 

Na(3P) interaction, according to the Lindholm-Foley impact theory [14],  with a calculated 
interaction constant of about 2*10-10 s-1 cm3, delivers a completely negligible line-width, and a null 

line-shift. Also, the Doppler broadening at this temperature contributes about 0.004 nm to the line-

width, and also causes a null line-shift. 

 

At indicated electron density (Ne = 9*1015 cm-3) the measured 

6

total line-shifts are 

about 0.08 nm. Using plasma parameters indicated above, our fit procedure delivers a Stark-widths 

for this transition of about 0.045 nm. The analogous calculated shift and broadening data for other 

two

. Furthermore, since typical ratio of the mean distance between 

ions and the Debye radius is 

R ≤

0.65

 (Eq. [9]), the contribution of ion broadening to the total line-

width and -shift of 

2
n S

P−

lines should be less than 10%. Therefore, one can assume for the 

 

10

Miokovic et al 

Stark broadening and shift parameters (Eqs. [7] - [8]) a linear dependence on electron density. On 

the other hand, the contribution of ion broadening to the total line width and shift of the 

2
n D

2
P−

lines could be up to 25%, and one cannot assume for Stark broadening parameters a 

safe linear dependence on electron density. 

 

The principle of the measurement of line-shifts is shown in Fig. 3 [26]. The line-positions 

measured from the high-pressure sodium discharge and from the low-pressure sodium lamp can 

be directly compared, delivering Stark shift, (

δλ

)
1/ 2 S

, of the corresponding line profiles. On the 

contrary, the Stark widths, the discharge temperature and the density of neutrals are determined 

indirectly, by fitting the synthetic line shapes to the measured line profiles as shown in the Fig. 4.  

The 6S-3P line shown in this figure is measured in NaCd  discharge at an electron density of 
(9±2.3)*1021 m-3.  The discharge temperature is determined to be 3900 ± 100 K. The mean relative 
velocity of Na-Cd pair at this temperature is 2.07*103 m/s. The density of ground state cadmium 
atoms is (1.8±0.6)*1024 m-3, and the ground state sodium atom density is (2.7±0.8)*1023 m-3.  The 

static polarizability, α,  of cadmium atoms is 49.7 a.u. [15]. The corresponding effective C6 constant 
for Na*(6S)-Cd pair is 5.4*10-29 s-1 cm6.  These values lead to an impact van der Waals line-shift of 

0.0055 nm , and to a displacement of the quasistatic profile of  0.00022 nm. Corresponding line-

broadening values are 0.015 nm for the impact line-width, and 0.00043 nm for the characteristic 

width of the quasistatic profile. At electron density of 9*1021 m-3 the  6

2

23
S − P

total line-shift is 

measured as (0.08±0.02) nm, and our fit procedure delivers (0.044±0.011) nm as the Stark-width 

of this transition. Since the line-shift of

 transition is completely dominated by Stark 

shift, (

1/ 2δλ

)

≈

(
15 δλ

S

vdW

 , the measured total line shift practically corresponds to Stark shift.   

 

In addition, we would like to note that synthetic line shapes calculated within the Bartels’ 

method were numerically convoluted [27] with the (0.13 ±0.01) nm wide Gaussian instrumental 

profile (determined in a separate experiment) in order to obtain the profile that can be directly 

compared to the measured one. The full line in Fig. 4 represents the best fit. The dashed (dotted) 

line represents the fit with 25% larger (smaller) Stark-width. The small picture shows the difference 

between corresponding calculated line shapes and experimental line-shape. Note that the best fit 

profile fits almost exactly the blue wing of the weaker component, and also very well the region of 

the blue wing of the stronger component. Both components show a slight residual discrepancy 

between calculated and measured red line-wing shape (maximum 8% difference in the red wing). 

We strongly believe that this residual line-shape discrepancy could be caused by quasistatic ion 

broadening. 

 

 

 

 

5. Results and Discussion 

11

Miokovic et al 

In Figs. 5a-c results of our measurements of line shifts of nS-3P lines (n=5,6,7) are compared with 

available theoretical data [7, 8, 9]. Note that electron densities in the NaCd and NaHg discharges 

are derived from the shift data of the 7S-3P line (Fig. 5a) with the Stark broadening parameters 

calculated by [9] and [11]. Traditionally, the line shift data are regarded as less reliable for 

determination of electron density in a discharge because of the difficulties in making accurate 

theoretical predictions. Since several effects with contributions of different sign could be 

responsible for the Stark shift of spectral lines, the theoretical shift parameters usually have a 

larger uncertainty. Fortunately, in the case of the 7S-3P transition two main contributions to the line 

shift, stem form the interaction with the 7p and 6p levels, and lead to the shifts of opposite sign 

[11]. Their energy difference to 7s level are about –0.085 eV and +0.062 eV, respectively. In 

addition, their sum is almost linear with respect to electron density. The random-phase (RPA) 

calculations of the 7S-3P line-shift  [11] completely confirm the line-shift data of Dimitrijevic [9]. 

Apparently, the 7S-3P line is well suited to measure electron density in high-pressure discharges 
containing sodium in the range of electron densities up to 1023 m-3. Consequently, our experimental 

points of the measured shift data for the 7S – 3P line are placed exactly on the line given by 

theoretical calculations of Dimitrijevic [9]. However, one can note that both, [7] and [9], calculations 

are within our experimental error bars (±25%). In addition one should take into account that 

claimed uncertainty of calculated shift data is about 30% [7]. The 6S – 3P and the 5S- 3P lines 

show a small but systematic discrepancy between experiment and calculations.  

In Figs. 6a-c results of our determinations of line widths of nS-3P lines (n=5,6,7) are 

compared with the available theoretical data [7, 8, 9]. The experimental points of the Stark-width 

data for the 7S – 3P line are scattered around the calculations of Dimitrijevic [9]. However, note 

again that both calculations, [7] and [9], are within our experimental error bars (±25%), and that 

claimed uncertainty of calculated width data is about 30% [7]. The widths of the 6S – 3P and the 

5S- 3P lines show a small but systematic discrepancy between experiment and calculations. 

In Figs. 7a-b results of our measurements of line shifts of 6D-3P and 5D-3P lines are 

compared with the available theoretical [7, 8, 9] and experimental data [11]. In the case of 6D – 3P 

transition our experimental data are situated closely to [7] and [11] calculations, and far away from 

the results given in [9]. In this case our data are grouping together with the experimental data given 

in [11].  In the case of 5D – 3P transition both, [7] and [9] calculations are within our experimental 

error bars (±25%), but one should also take into account that claimed uncertainty of calculated shift 

data is about 30% [7]. Apparently our data are grouping along the RPA [11] and [9] theoretical 

lines.  While the estimated contribution of ion broadening to the total line width and shift of 

2
n S

23
P−

lines is less than our estimated error (±25%), the contribution of ion broadening to the 

total line width and shift of the 

2

lines could be comparable to our error bars. 

Furthermore, for all nS-3P lines departure from isolated line approximation can be expected at very

3. For the 6D-3P line it is even lower, 4*1021 m-3, suggesting that these two lines could not be safely 

regarded as completely isolated.  

Finally, in Fig.8 the measured Stark shifts of sodium nS-3P lines (n=5,6,7) at Ne=1*1022 m-3 

are plotted versus the upper state quantum number together with theoretical Stark shifts derived 

for the same experimental conditions. There is a smooth dependence of the Stark shifts, both 

experimental and theoretical, on the upper state quantum number up to quantum number n=7. The 

experimental data show a systematic disagreement with the theoretical curves towards smaller 

quantum numbers, but available calculations disagree substantially in the range of higher quantum 

numbers, starting with n ≥ 8. Additional experiments are needed to clarify noted discrepancies.

 transitions. The measurements are 

compared with available theoretical [7, 8, 9, 11] as well as experimental data [11]. The 7S-3P line 

has been used as a calibrant line to measure the electron density in both, NaHg and NaCd, high-

pressure discharges. The data measured for the 6S – 3P and the 5S- 3P lines show a small but 

systematic discrepancy between experiment and theory. The line shifts of 5D-3P transition are in 

very good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical data. In the case of 6D – 3P 

transition our experimental data are in a satisfactory agreement with the existing experimental and 

theoretical data. The residual discrepancies between experiment and theory can be attributed to 

the influence of ion broadening and, in the case of the nD-3P transitions, to the breakdown of the 

isolated line approximation. In addition, the systematic disagreement between theory and 

experiment towards smaller quantum numbers and substantial disagreement of calculations in the 

range of higher quantum numbers asks for additional experiments and calculations in order to 

clarify noted disagreement.

Fig. 8  Measured and calculated Stark-shifts of sodium nS-3P lines (n=5,6,7) at Ne=1*1016 cm-3 plotted 
versus the upper state quantum number. Note a systematic disagreement of the experiment and calculations 

towards smaller quantum numbers (n=4, 5), and also substantial disagreement of the theoretical data in the 

range of higher quantum numbers, n ≥ 8. . Explanation of the symbols: ●●● this experiment , – – – theory

What is a Question?

Abstract. A given question can be defined in terms of the set of statements or assertions that 
answer it.  Application of logical inference to these sets of assertions allows one to derive the 
logic  of  inquiry  among  questions.    There  are  interesting  symmetries  between  the  logics  of 
inference  and  inquiry;  where  probability  describes  the  degree  to  which  a  premise  implies  an 
assertion,  there  exists  an  analogous  measure  that  describes  the  bearing  or  relevance  that  a 
question  has  on  an  outstanding  issue.    These  have  been  extended  to  suggest  that  the  logic  of 
inquiry results in functional relationships analogous to, although more general than, those found 
in information theory. 

Employing lattice theory, I examine in greater detail the structure of the space of assertions 
and  questions  demonstrating  that  the  symmetries  between  the  logical  relations  in  each  of  the 
spaces  derive  directly  from  the  lattice  structure.    Furthermore,  I  show  that  while  symmetries 
between  the  spaces  exist,  the  two  lattices  are  not  isomorphic.    The  lattice  of  assertions  is 
, whereas the lattice of assuredly real questions is shown to be 
described by a Boolean lattice

a sublattice of the free distributive lattice 
.  Thus there does not exist a one-to-one 
mapping of assertions to questions, there is no reflection symmetry between the two spaces, and 
questions in general do not possess complements.  Last, with these lattice structures in mind, I 
discuss the relationship between probability, relevance, and entropy.  
 
 
“Man has made some machines that can answer questions provided the facts 
are profusely stored in them, but we will never be able to make a machine that 
will ask questions. The ability to ask the right question is more than half the 
battle of finding the answer.”

INTRODUCTION 

It  was  demonstrated  by  Richard  T.  Cox  [1,  2]  that  probability  theory  represents  a 
generalization of Boolean implication to a degree of implication represented by a real 
number.  This insight has placed probability theory on solid ground as a calculus for 
conducting  inductive  inference.    While  at  this  stage  this  work  is  undoubtedly  his 
greatest  contribution,  his  ultimate  paper,  which  takes  steps  to  derive  the  logic  of 
questions in terms of the set of assertions that answer them, may prove yet to be the 
most  revolutionary.    While  much  work has been done extending and applying Cox's 
results  [3-12],  the  mathematical  structure  of  the  space  of  questions  remains  poorly 
understood.  In this paper I employ lattice theory to describe the structure of the space 

of assertions and demonstrate how logical implication on the Boolean lattice provides 
the  framework  on  which  the  calculus  of  inductive  inference  is  constructed.    I  then 
introduce questions by following Cox [13] who defined a question in terms of the set 
of assertions that can answer it.  The lattice structure of questions is then explored and 
the  calculus  for  manipulating  the  relevance  of  a  question  to  an  unresolved  issue  is 
examined. 

The  first  section  is  devoted  to  the  formalism  behind  the  concepts  of  partially 
ordered  sets  and  lattices.    The  second  section  deals  with  the  logic  of  assertions  and 
introduces  Boolean  lattices.    In  the  third  section,  I  introduce  the  definition  of  a 
question  and  introduce  the  concept  of  an  ideal  question.    From  the  set  of  ideal 
questions  I  construct  the  entire  question  lattice  identifying  it  as  a  free  distributive 
lattice.  Assuredly real questions are then shown to comprise a sublattice of the entire 
lattice of questions.  In the last section I discuss the relationship between probability, 
relevance, and entropy in the context of the lattice structure of these spaces.

In this section I begin with the concept of a partially ordered set, called a poset, which

all a, b, c [14]:

Alternatively one can write

 is not true for any x in the poset 
x
contained in b”.  Furthermore, if 
<<
P, then we say that “b covers a”, written 
.  In this case b can be considered an 
immediate  superior  to  a  in  a  hierarchy.    The  set  of  natural  numbers  {1,  2,  3,  4,  5} 
along with the binary relation “less than or equal to” 
≤  is an example of a poset.  In 
2 < , but there is no number x in the 
3
this poset, the number 3 covers the number 2 as 
set  where  2
.    This  covering  relation  is  useful  in  constructing  diagrams  to 
visualize the structure imposed on these sets by the binary relation.

Posets also possess a duality in the sense that the converse of any partial ordering 
is  itself  a  partial  ordering  [14].    This  is  known  as  the  duality  principle  and  can  be 
understood  by  changing  the  ordering  relation  “is  included  in”  to  “includes”  which 
equates graphically to flipping the poset diagram upside-down.

With  these  examples  of  posets  in  mind,  I  must  briefly  describe  a  few  more 
concepts.  If one considers a subset X of a poset P, we can talk about an element 
Pa ∈
 
; such an element is called an upper bound of the 
that contains every element 
subset X.  The least upper bound, or l.u.b., is an element in P, which is an upper bound 
of X and is contained in every other upper bound of X.  Thus the l.u.b. can be thought 
of as the immediate successor to the subset X as one moves up the hierarchy.  Dually 
we can define the greatest lower bound, or g.l.b.  The least element of a subset X is an 
element  a
Xx ∈ .  The greatest element is defined dually.

concept  of  covering  allows  us  to  draw  lines  between  a  pair  of  elements  signifying  that  the  higher 
element  in  the  pair  is  an  immediate  successor  in  the  hierarchy.    Note  that  {a}  is  covered  by  two 
 
elements.  These diagrams nicely illustrate the structural properties of the poset.  The element  {

Lattices 

The next important concept is the lattice.  A lattice is a poset P where every pair of 
elements  x  and  y  has  a  least  upper  bound  called  the  join,  denoted  as 
,  and  a 
greatest lower bound called the meet, denoted by  x
.  The meet and join obey the 
following relations [14]:

The relations L1-4 above come in pairs related by the duality principle; as they hold 
equally for a lattice L and its dual lattice (denoted 
), which is obtained by reversing 
the  ordering  relation  thus  exchanging  upper  bounds  for  lower  bounds  and  hence 
exchanging joins and meets.  Note that the meet and join are generally defined for all 
posets satisfying the definition of a lattice; even though the notation is the same they 
should not be confused with the logical conjunction and disjunction, which refer to a 
specific ordering relation.  I will get to how they are related and we will see that lattice 
theory  provides  a  general  framework  that  clears  up  some  mysteries  surrounding  the 
space of assertions and the space of questions.

THE LOGIC OF ASSERTIONS 

Boolean Lattices 

I introduce the concept of a Boolean lattice, which possesses structure in addition to 
L1-4.  A Boolean lattice is a distributive lattice satisfying the following identities for 
all x, y, z: 
 

B1. 

x

∧

(

y

∨

z

)

=

(

x

z

)

=

(

x

∨

y

)

∧

(

x

∨

z

)

 

 

 

 

(Distributive) 

 
Again the two identities are related by the duality principle.  Last the Boolean lattice is 
a  complemented  lattice,  such  that  each  element  x  has  one  and  only  one  complement 
x~  that satisfies [14]: 
 
B2. 
B3. 
B4. 
 
where O and I are the least and greatest elements, respectively, of the lattice.  Thus a 
Boolean lattice is a complemented distributive lattice.

We now consider a specific application where the elements 

 are logical 
 and 
assertions and the ordering relation is 
, read “x implies y”.  The logical 
y
operations of conjunction and disjunction can be used to generate a set of four logical 
statements, which with the binary relation “implies” forms a Boolean lattice displayed 
in Figure 2.  It can be shown that the meet of a and b, written 
a ∧ , is identified with

the logical conjunction of a and b, and the join of a and b, written 
with the logical disjunction of a and b.  I will require that the lattice be complemented, 
which  means  that  the  complement  of  a  must  be  b, 
,  and  vice  versa.    If  we 
require the assertions to be exhaustive, then either a or b are true, and their join, the 
disjunction 
 must be the greatest element and 
is thus I, which in logic is called the truism, as it is always true.  Similarly their meet, 
the conjunction  a
, is the least element O and when a and b are mutually exclusive 
O must always be false, earning it the name the absurdity.

arrows to emphasize the direction of implication among the assertions in the lattice.

The  symbol  for  the  truism  I   mirrors  the 

  used  by  Jaynes  to  symbolize  “one’s 
prior information” [15].  In fact, in an inference problem, if one believes that one of a 
set of assertions is true then one’s prior knowledge consists, in part, of the fact that the 
disjunction  of  the  entire  set  of  assertions  is  true.    By  fortuitous  circumstance  the 
notation of lattice theory agrees quite nicely with the notation used by Jaynes. 

I

Deductive inference refers to the process where one knows that an assertion 
 is 
true, and deduces that any assertion reached by a chain of arrows must also be true.  If 
for two assertions x and y elements of a lattice L, x is included in y, 
, we say that 
x implies y, denoted 

y→ .

These  elements  that  cover  O   are  called  atoms  or  points.    As  all  other  elements  are 
formed  from  joins  of  these  atoms,  they  are  called  generators  or  generating  elements 
and the lattice is called an atomic lattice.  The total number of assertions in the atomic 
Boolean lattice is 
 is the number of atoms.  These Boolean lattices can 
be  named  according  to  the  number  of  atoms,  2 .    The  first  three  atomic  Boolean 
lattices are shown in Figure 3.  In these figures one can visualize the curious fact of 
logic: the absurdity 
 implies everything.  Also, it is instructive to identify and verify

Thus  we  should  expect  some  form  of  indeterminacy  that  will  require  us  to  impose 
additional  structure  on  the  space.    This  manifests  itself  in  the  fact  that  the  prior

Richard Cox [13] defines a system of assertions as a set of assertions, which includes 
every assertion implying any assertion of the set.  The irreducible set is a subset of the 
system,  which  contains  every  assertion  that  implies  no  assertion  other  than  itself.  
Finally,  a  defining  set  of  a  system  is  a  subset  of  the  system,  which  includes  the 
irreducible set.  As an example, consider the lattice  2  in Figure 3 right.  To generate 
a system of assertions, we will start with the set {
.  The system must also contain 
all the assertions in the lattice which imply both assertion a and assertion b.  These are 
all  the  assertions  that  can  be  reached  by  climbing  down  the  lattice  from  these  two 
elements.  In this case, the lattice is rather small and the only assertion that implies the 
assertions in this set is O, the absurdity.  Thus {
 is a system of assertions.  The 
irreducible  set  is  simply  the  set  {
.    Last,  there  are  two  defining  sets  for  this 
system: 
.    Note  that  in  general  there  are  many  defining  sets.  
Given  a  defining  set,  one  can  reduce  it  to  the  irreducible  set  by  removing  assertions 
that  are  implied  by  another  assertion  in  the  defining  set,  or  expand  it  by  including 
implicants of assertions in the defining set, to the point of including the entire system. 
Cox defines a question as the system of assertions that answer that question.  Why 
the  system  of  assertions?    The  reason  is  that  any  assertion  that  implies  another 
assertion  that  answers  a  question  is  itself  an  answer  to  the  same  question.    Thus  the 
system  of  assertions  represents  an  exhaustive  set  of  possible  answers  to  a  given 
question.  Two questions are then equivalent if they are answered by the same system 
of assertions.  This can be easily demonstrated with the questions “Is it raining?” and 
“Is it not raining?”  Both questions are answered by the statements “It is raining!” and 
“It is not raining!”, and thus they are equivalent in the sense that they ask the same 
thing.  Furthermore, one can now impose an ordering relation on questions, as some 
questions  may  include  other  questions  in  the  sense  that  one  system  of  assertions 
contains another system of assertions as a subset.

Consider the following question:  T = “Who stole the tarts made by the Queen of 
Hearts  all  on  a  summer  day?”    This  question  can  be  written  as  a  set  of  all  possible 
statements that answer it.  Here I contrive a simple defining set for T, which I claim is 
an exhaustive, irreducible set

}. 

This is a fun example as it is not clear from the story1 that the tarts were even stolen.  
In the event that no one stole the tarts, the question is answered by no true statement 
and  is  called  a  vain  question  [13].    If  there  exists  a  true  statement  that  answers  the 
question,  that  question  is  called  a  real  question.    For  the  sake  of  this  example,  we 
assume that the question T is real, and consider an alternate question A = “Did or did 
not Alice steal the tarts?”  A defining set for this question is 

A

As  the  defining  set  of  T  is  exhaustive,  the  statement 
a~   above,  which  is  the 
complement  of  a ,  is  equivalent  to  the  disjunction  of  all  the  statements  in  the 
.    As  the  question  A  is  a 
irreducible  set  of  T  except  for  a ,  that  is 
system of assertions, which includes all the assertions that imply any assertion in its 
defining set, the system of assertions A must also contain k, m and w as each implies 
a~ .  Thus system of assertions T is a subset of the system of assertions A, and so by 
answering T, one will have answered A.  Of course, the converse is not generally true.  
In the past has been said [11] that the question A includes the question T, but it may be 
more  obvious  to  see  that  the  question  T  answers  the  question  A.    As  I  will 
demonstrate,  identifying  the  conjunction  of  questions  with  the  meet  and  the 
disjunction  of  questions  with  the  join  is  consistent  with  the  ordering  relation  “is  a 
subset of”.  This however is dual to the ordering relation intuitively adopted by Cox, 
“includes  as  a  subset”,  which  alone  is  the  source  of  the  interchange  between 
conjunction  and  disjunction  in  identifying  relations  among  assertions  with  relations 
among questions in Cox’s formalism. 

With the ordering relation "is a subset of" the meet or conjunction of two questions, 
called the joint question, can be shown to be the intersection of the sets of assertions 
answering each question.

It should be noted that Cox’s treatment dealt with the case where there the system was 
not built on an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive atomic assertions.  This leads to a 
more general definition of the joint question [13], which reduces to set intersection in 
the case of an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive atomic assertions.  Similarly, the 
join  or  disjunction  of  two  questions,  called  the  common  question,  is  defined  as  the 
question that the two questions ask in common.  It can be shown to be the union of the 
sets of assertions answering each question

According to the definitions laid out in the section on posets, the consistency relation

Notation aside, the concepts I have been discussing are unaltered and can be more

An ideal is a nonvoid subset J of a lattice A with the properties [14]

I2. 
 
In the case that the lattice A is a lattice of assertions, property I1 above is a necessary 
and sufficient condition for the set J to be a system of assertions.  Thus each ideal of a 
lattice  of  assertions  represents  a  unique  system  of  assertions,  or  equivalently  a 
question.    For  this  reason,  I  call  these  systems  of  assertions,  which  are  also  ideals, 
ideal systems or ideal questions.

Furthermore, one can show ([14], Theorem 3.3) that the set of all ideals of any lattice 
L  ordered  by  set  inclusion  forms  a  lattice
  is 
isomorphic  to  L.    This  is  significant,  as  the  space  of  ideal  questions  possesses  a 
structure isomorphic to the space of assertions (Figure 5).  An inverse mapping can be 
defined as a function 
 that takes an ideal question to an assertion by selecting the 
greatest element from its system of assertions, so that

At  this  point  the  space  of  assertions  looks  isomorphic  to  the  space  of  questions.  
However,  recall  that  the  ideal  questions  satisfy  an  additional  property  I2,  which 
requires  that  there  be  a  single  greatest  element  in  the  set.    This  is  not  a  property 
required of questions in general by the definition put forward by Cox.  Thus there exist 
additional questions not represented in the lattice

Thus  far  in  these  examinations  one  important  point  has  been  neglected;  I  have  not

then  only  questions  containing  the  set  of  atoms  as  a  subset  are  assured  to  be  real 
questions.  There of course may be questions that do not contain this entire set, that for 
a  given  situation  may  be  answerable  by  a  true  assertion,  but  this  in  general  is  not 
guaranteed  a  priori.    The  least  element  that  contains  the  set  of  atoms  as  a  subset  is

Looking at the lattices in Figure 6, it appears in each case that the sublattice R(N)  
(excluding 
) is Boolean (compare to the lattice structures in Figure 3).  However, 
this  pattern  does  not  hold  in  general  and  in  fact  fails  for  Q .    This  can  be 
demonstrated by looking at what are called the join-irreducible elements of R(N).  In 
short these are the elements of a lattice that cannot be written as a join of elements of 
the lattice, excluding O.  In any finite Boolean lattice, the join-irreducible elements are 
  in  Figure  3)  [21,  22].    The  poset  formed  by  these  atoms  alone 
its  atoms  (see 
consists  only  of  these  elements  side-by-side,  and  is  called  an  antichain  (Figure  7a).  
Thus  the  join-irreducible  elements  of  a  Boolean  lattice  form  an  antichain,  written 
.    A  proof  that  R(N)  is  not  Boolean,  which  will  be 
symbolically  as 
published  by  in  a  future  paper,  relies  on  the  observation  that  the  join-irreducible 
elements of R(N)  are of the form

Inductive Inquiry on Lattices 

As briefly described earlier, the sum rule of probability (2) derives from the fact that 
Boolean lattices are uniquely complemented.  In Cox's earlier work, he described how 
there  could  be  no  complete  analog  in  the  algebra  of  systems  (questions)  to  the 
complement in the algebra of assertions ([2], pp. 52-3).  In a footnote Cox describes 
how  Boole  [23]  applied  his  algebra  to  classes  of  objects  in  addition  to  propositions 
(see Figure 1).  He notes that one might be inclined to think of a system as a class as 
defined  by  Boole,  however  the  set  of  assertions  not  included  in  a  system,  while 
forming a class, do not itself form a system.   For this reason the algebra of systems 
cannot possibly be Boolean. 

In Cox' paper on inquiry [13] he defines a mutually contradictory pair of questions 
"as a pair whose conjunction is equal to the conjunction of all questions, and whose 
disjunction  is  equal  to  the  disjunction  of  all  questions."    While  this  definition  is 
acceptable, he does not prove their existence.  While my discussion on join-irreducible 
elements  may  convincingly  prove  to  a  mathematician  familiar  with  the  theory  that 
complements to questions do not exist, those less-familiar may require more tangible 
evidence.    Consider  the  question 
  in  the  lattice  Q(3),  (Figure  6c).    Its

Last,  distributive  lattices  share  the  associative  and  commutative  properties  of  the 
Boolean lattice.  For this reason, one can fully expect that generalizations of the binary 
ordering relation to measures of degree of inclusion will result in a calculus possessing 
a product rule as well as a rule analogous to Bayes' Theorem. 

RELEVANCE AND PROBABILITY 

There  is  a  deep  relationship  between  the  Boolean  lattice  and  the  free  distributive 
lattice generated from it.  Looking at the lattices 
, and  Q , one can see 
that the join-irreducible elements are precisely the ideal questions, which have a lattice 
structure  isomorphic  to  the  original  Boolean  lattice  from  which  the  questions  were 
3 
generated.    This  is  the  map
) ,  whereas  the  process  of  generating  the 
question lattice is a map from the Boolean lattice of assertions to the question lattice, 
.    We  thus  have  an  isomorphic  correspondence  between

finite  distributive  lattices  Q  and  all  finite  ordered  sets  A  and  is  known  as  Birkhoff's 
Representation Theorem [16].  The lattice Q is called the dual of J(A) and A is called 
the dual of O(Q), however this duality should not be confused with the duality induced 
by the ordering relation discussed earlier.  Furthermore, it can be shown that the join-
irreducible map takes products of lattices to sums of lattices, so that one can think of 
Q a
  as  being  the  logarithm  and  exponential  functions, 
respectively,  for  lattices  [16].    This  is  quite  enticing  in  that  it  further  supports  our 
expectations that the relevance of a question on an issue can be represented in terms of 
the  logarithms  of  the  probabilities  of  the  assertions  involved,  and  that  entropy  may 
play the same role with distributive lattices as probability does with Boolean lattices.

THE ROLE OF ORDER 

The lattice structure of the space of assertions and the space of questions has provided 
great  insights  into  their  structures,  symmetries,  and  relationships.    In  addition,  the 
associative  and  commutative  properties  of  lattices  suggest  that  analogies  to  the 
familiar product rule of probability and Bayes' Theorem may appear in the calculi of 
other  fields  where  ordering  relations  play  an  important  role.    This  in  fact  may  have 
already been recognized with the realization that the cross-ratio in projective geometry 
has  the  same  form  as  the  odds  ratio  from  Bayes'  Theorem  [24].    Considering  the 
findings  in  this  paper,  such  a  relationship  may  no  longer  be  such  a  mystery  as  the 
notion of closeness in a projective space provides such an ordering relation.  In fact, 
we  might  now  not  be  surprised  to  see  forms  identical  to  probability  and  perhaps 
entropy appearing in seemingly unrelated fields.  In such cases, it is not geometry that 
underlies these theories – but order.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

I would like to thank Jeffrey Jewell for noting at MaxEnt 2001 that my work reminded him of lattice 
theory, and Ralph Freese, David Clark, and Mick Adams for their correspondences, which have helped 
me to better understand the ins-and-outs of this theoretical framework.  I would also like to extend a 
special thank you to my friend and colleague Domhnull Granquist-Fraser who inspired me to keep my 
focus during this effort.  Last, I would like to thank Bob Fry for introducing me to this fascinating area 
of study and for his continued friendship.

Abstract.  This paper analyzes the consequences of electric current generation at the front of the 
Bow Shock (BS) and the dependence of the direction of this current on the IMF. The conditions of 
this  current  closure  through  the  body  of  the  magnetosphere  are  discussed.  It  is  shown  that  the 
process  of  penetration  of  the  external  current  into  magnetized  plasma  has  a  two-stage  character. 
Initially, a change in current on the boundary gives rise to a region of surface charge, the field of 
which  polarizes  the  near-wall  layer  with  the  thickness  on  the  order  of  one  gyroradius  of  protons. 
The  polarization  process  involves  the  formation  of  the  displacement  current  which  produces  the 
Ampere  force  accelerating  the  plasma  inside  the  double  layer.  When  the  plasma  velocity  reaches 
the electric drift velocity (within a time on the order of the inverse gyrofrequency of protons), the 
electric  field  in  this  plasma  disappears,  whereas  in  a  fixed  frame  of  reference,  on  the  contrary,  it 
reaches equilibrium values. The front of variation of the electric field penetrates the plasma with the 
velocity  of  a  fast  magnetosonic  wave.  A  change  in  the  convection  velocity  field  causes  a 
redistribution  of  plasma  pressure.  The  appearance  of  corresponding  gradients  signifies  the 
penetration of current into plasma. The gradients are changing until a new steady state is reached, to 
which the new  convection velocity field  and the new plasma pressure field correspond. This new 
state is reached in a time τ2 which is estimated.  
 
Formulation of the problem 

 
     The Bow Shock (BS), separating the Solar Wind (SW) region from the  Transition 
Layer (TL) is, as shown in [Ponomarev et al., 2000], a transformer that converts the 
solar wind kinetic energy to electric energy. As a result, under the shock wave there 
arises a current sheet separating the region of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) 
of  the  solar  wind  from  the  magnetic  field  of  the  transition  layer.  If  the  vertical 
component  of  the  IMF  is  in  the  solar  ecliptic  coordinate  system,  Bz  <  0,  then  the 
current under the BS flows in the clockwise direction, and if Bz > 0, then it flows in 
the  counterclockwise  direction.  Fig.  1  shows  a  portion  of  the  bow  shock,  the 
transition  layer,  and  of  the  fore  part  of  the  magnetosphere.  The  plane  of  the  figure 
coincides with the XY plane of the magnetospheric coordinate system. For the sake 
of convenience, we introduced also a local coordinate system l,n,z, the axis l of which 
is in opposition to the plasma flow in the TL, and the axis n is normal to streamlines, 
in such a way as to produce a left-handed coordinate system. 
All  functions  or  parameters  have  the  index  0  in  the  SW,  1  in  the  TL,  and  2  in  the 
magnetosphere, so that the mass velocity v0, v1 and v2 implies the plasma velocity in 
the solar wind, the transition layer, and in the magnetosphere, respectively.

We shall approximate the Bow Shock with the hyperboloid of revolution. It is not a 
very good approximation as regards accuracy, but then it is a very simple one. 
Thus: 

y = [ k2(x-c)2 – b2]1/2 ,            (1) 

 
where r = [x2 + g2]1/2, g2 = y2 + z2, k = b/a, c2 = a2 + b2; a and b being the semiaxes of 
the hyperboloid with the origin at the focus. 
These  parameters  are  conveniently  expressed  in  terms  of  the  distance  to  the  “nose” 
point,  ro  =  xo,  and  rc  =  b2/a,  the  distance  from  the  focus  to  the  surface  of  the 
hyperboloid  along  a  normal.  In  dimensional  quantities,  which  are  italicized  in  the 
present case, a = a/xo, or example: 
 

a = 1/[rc -2],  b =rc

1/2 /[rc – 2]1/2,  c = (rc-1)/(rc – 2),                (2) 

 
Let  α  represent  the  angle  between  the  axis  x  and  a  tangent  to  the  surface  of  the 
hyperboloid. Then dr/dx = tgα. The angle α varies from π/2 to a limiting value of α* 
=  arctg(b/a)  corresponding  to  the  asymptote.  Since  α*  is  the  Mach  angle  (here  we 
shall use virtually the Alfvén mach): 
 

sin α∗ = vo/VA = M-1 ,                             (3) 

 
the  parameters  of  the  hyperboloid  can  also  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  Mach 
number. 
In  some  cases  it  is  convenient  to  use  a  classical  equation  for  the  hyperboloid  of 
revolution:  
 

r = y0/(1 + e cosϕ),                 (4) 

 
where  ϕ  is  the  angle  between  the  radius  vector  directed  from  the  origin  to  a    given 
point of the surface of the hyperboloid of revolution, y0 is the distance from the origin 
of coordinates to the surface of the hyperboloid in the plane x=0, e = (y0 - x0)/x0 is the 
eccentricity of the hyperboloid, and x0 is the distance from the origin of coordinates 
to the nose point of the BS. 
In  crossing  the  shock  front,  the  plasma  parameters are modified in accordance with 
the following relations [Korobeinikov et al., 1985]: 

 
Bn0 = Bn1                                                                     (5) 
ρ0vn0 = ρ1vn1                                                                           (6) 
vn0Bs0 – vs0Bn0 = vn1Bs1 –  vs1Bn0                                               (7)

2/4π] vn1               (10) 

 
where the indices “n” and “s” designate a normal or tangential field components with 
respect  to  the  surface  of  the  hyperboloid,  the  BS  front.  In  (8)-(10)  it  is  taken  into 
consideration  that  gas  and  magnetic  pressure  in  the  solar  wind  is  much  less  than 
dynamic pressure. From (7) and (9) we find: 
 

Bs1 = Bs0 σ [1- Bn0

2/4πρ0vn0

Here  σ  implies  the  ratio  (vn0/vn1).  It  is  evident  that  with  the  increasing  normal 
component of the magnetic field, the appearance of a singularity in (11) and (12) may 
be  problem. The infinite increase of the tangential components of the magnetic field 
and velocity behind the shock front can be avoided if σ is made tend to 1. But then, in 
essence,  the  shock  wave  disappears.  The  transition  through  the  “front”  is  not 
accompanied by any jump of velocity, density, etc. Essentially, the problem reduces 
to seeking the value of the density jump or a normal flow velocity component at the 
transition through the shock front. Let σ = vn0/vn1; eliminating p1 from (8) and (10) 
and using (11) and (12) we then find the equation for σ: 
 

(σ -1)(σ−σ∗)(Μn
+(2−γ)/(γ−1)⋅[σ3 (Mn

The following designations are adopted here: 
 

Mn

2 = (B0/Bn0)2M2sin2α,      Ms

2 = (B0/Bs)2M2sin2α.                  (14) 

 
B0 is the value of the modulus of the full magnetic field vector of the solar wind; Bn0 
is  the  value  of  a  normal  component  of  the  solar  wind  magnetic  field  in  a  local 
coordinate system (along the axis n); Mn, Ms and M are the local mach numbers and 
the  Mach-Alfvén-Mach  number,  respectively;  and  σ*  =  (γ+1)/(γ-1).  The  other 
designations  correspond  to  those  adopted  previously.  It  is  evident  from  (13)  that  at 
2 ⇒ σ, the σ itself tends to 3! It is 
large values of Mn we have σ=σ*, and when Mn
remarkable that it is such a value that corresponds to σ* when the adiabatic index γ 
becomes equal to two, as in the case of gas with two degrees of freedom. 
 
Penetration of the electric current into the magnetosphere and formation of 
convection 
 

     In a local coordinate system, the magnetic field components are of the form: 
 

Bl1= σ[Bx0cosα + (By0sinυ- Bz0cosυ)sinα]                                             (15) 
Bn1=    Bx0sinα - (By0sinυ - Bz0cosυ)cosα                                               (16) 
Bτ1= σ[By0cosυ + Bz0sinυ],                                                                      (17) 
here υ is the angle between the plane {x,z} of the magnetospheric coordinate system 
and the plane {l,n} of a local coordinate system. Taking the curl of the magnetic field 
in a local coordinate system we obtain the value of the current density in this system. 
In this case our concern is only with the normal component: 

jn1 = c/4π[∂Bτ1/∂l - ∂Bll /∂τ]                                          (18) 

 
Since  Bτl  is  independent  of  the  variables  related  to  the  l-coordinate  (to  α,  for 
example), the first term in square brackets in (18) is zero. 
Since dτ = gdυ, for the normal current density we have: 
 

jn1=  -(cσ/4πg)⋅[By0cosυ  +  Bz0sinυ]sinα ,                (19) 

 
where g = (y2 + z2)1/2 is defined by equation (1). 
Thus  we  have  obtained  the  expression  for  the  density  of  the  electric  field  which  is 
produced  under  the  Bow  Shock  and  is  directed  into  the  cavity  formed  by  the  BS. 
According to all indications, it is just the current that feeds electromagnetic energy to 
magnetospheric  processes.  Firstly,  it  depends  on  the  By-  and  Bz-components  of  the 
IMF, and, secondly, it has a negative dawn-dusk component that depends only on Bz, 
and the north-southward component that depends only on By. It is such an association 
with  IMF  By  that  is  revealed  by  geomagnetic  variations  [Uvarov  et  al.,  1989]. 
Thirdly,  a numerical estimation of jn1 gives for σ = 4, g = 1010 cm and B0 ~ 5 nT the 
value  of  the  current  density  corresponding  to  the  value  of  the  dawn-dusk  current 
density  in  empirical  models  [Mead  et  al.,  1975].  At  first  glance  the  expression  (19) 
has a nonremovable singularity when g→0, that is, at the nose point. In fact, this is 
not the case. Formula (19) describes two streams at a time: one outflowing stream at 
an  angle  π/2-  α  and  one  inflowing  stream  at  an  angle  -(π/2-  α)  to  the  axis  x.  At  a 
small  g  the  difference  of  these  angles  is  also  small.  In  the  limiting  case  these 
oppositely directed currents coincide, and there is no net current. Clearly, when g are 
small,  currents  close  in  the  transition  layer  and  do  not  penetrate  into  the 
magnetosphere (Fig. 1a). One has therefore to introduce a certain parameter, the least 
value of gm, at which formula (19) is applicable for the magnetosphere. The simplest 
choice is when gm = d, where d is the TL thickness at the nose point. 
Before penetrating the magnetosphere, the current jn1 must pass through the transition 
layer  and,  hence,  we  have  to  discuss  the  question  of  the  interaction  of  this  current 
with  the  TL  plasma.  Essentially,  it  has  the  role  of  loading,  to  which  some  of  the 

electric power is conveyed, yet it can also act as the generator operating in series. All 
depends on the sign of the scalar product on the right-hand side of the equation: 
 

ρvdv/dt + v∇p = jE                                              (20) 

 
If jE > 0, then electromagnetic energy is consumed in the system; if, however, jE < 0, 
then, on the contrary, the system generates electromagnetic energy. The second term 
on  the  left-hand  side  of  the  equality  represents  unequivocally  the  generator,  since 
v∇p < 0. The first term represents the energy consumer, because when the TL plasma 
travels  along  the  interface  between  the  BS  front  and  the  magnetopause,  its  kinetic 
energy  increases.  Thus  the  question  as  to  whether  the  TL  plasma  serves  as  the 
generator or loading depends on the relationship of the values of the first and second 
terms on the left-hand side of (20). 
In [Ponomarev, 2000] we showed that with some assumptions about the contribution 
from “fresh” plasma (i.e. which has just penetrated through the front into the TL), the 
left-hand side of (20) can operate as a generator. Of course, relying on assumptions is 
always undesirable. For that reason, in this paper we calculated the jn1 directly from 
the values of the transformed magnetic field. With such a statement of the problem, 
the role of the inertia term is a merely passive one. In the absence of current, plasma 
is accelerated only due to a decrease in pressure along the TL, and in the presence of 
current,  it  is  accelerated  additionally.  In  this  case  kinetic  energy  buildup  does  not 
depend on the direction of current. 
On the other hand, it is clear that the magnetosphere cannot receive more current than 
produced by the BS. 
     We now briefly discuss the conditions which must be satisfied for the penetration 
of  current  into  the  magnetosphere.  Let  at  the  initial  time  the  electric  current  be 
homogeneous and directed along the axis y. If at a certain time the current jo increases 
by δj outside the volume under consideration, then a  charge with surface density µ = 
∫ δj dt starts to form on its boundary. The resulting electric field E will give rise to a 
displacement current jc = (ε/4π)⋅∂Ε/∂t, that creates an Ampere force which is balanced 
only  by  the  inertial  force,  because  the  corresponding  pressure  gradient  has  not  yet 
formed: 
 

ρо ∂v/∂t = [jc x B]/c                                                      (21 ) 

 
In  magnetospheric  conditions  dielectric  permittivity  of  plasma  ε  =  c2/VA
integrating (21) gives: 
 

v =  c[E x B]/ B2 ,                                                             (22 ) 

2,  then 

(in  view  of  the  fact  that  the  squares  of  the  perturbed  quantities  can  be  neglected  as 
having the second order of smallness). 

The  physical  meaning  of  what  has  been  said  above  implies  that  the  polarization 
electric field is produced inside the double layer with a thickness on the order of ξ = 
2πcs/ωB = πc/ωpp, where cs is the velocity of the fast magnetosonic wave, and ωpp is 
the  proton  plasma  frequency  (such  a  thickness  is  characteristic  for  current  sheets  in 
collisionless laboratory and space plasmas). In the buildup process this field produces 
a  displacement  current  that  forms  an  Ampere  force  which  accelerates  the  plasma 
inside  this  layer.  Whereas  in  the  buildup  process  the  electric  field  in  the  plasma 
coordinate  system  drops  to  zero  and  in  the  laboratory  coordinate  system,  on  the 
contrary, it increases to [VxB]/c. 
Because  after  the  relaxation  of  the  field  inside  the  layer  the  boundary  with  surface 
charge has displaced into the plasma (in a time τ1 ~ 2π/ωB) to a distance on the order 
of  ξ,  all  that  has  been  described  above  is  repeated.  Obviously,  this  signifies  the 
penetration  of  the  electric  field-associated  momentum  into  the  plasma  with  the 
velocity of sound. Here is how convection starts to form (see Fig. 2). 
If  there  are  no  losses  in  plasma  and  divV=0,  then  the  story  ends  up  with  this.  The 
plasma receives the momentum from the electric field, corresponding to the velocity 
of steady-state convection. 
No stationary electric current is produced in this case. But if the volume is bounded 
by  the  walls  or  if  it  contains  an  inhomogeneous  magnetic  field,  then  primary 
convection  undergoes  restructuring,  with  the  possible  formation  of  a  pressure 
gradient, the existence of which implies that an electric current arises in plasma. This 
does implies the penetration of the external current into plasma. 
Next,  we  consider  the  formation  of  a  pressure  gradient  caused  by  plasma 
compressibility. From the continuity equation we have: 

ρ′ = -ρо ∫ div V dt                                                       (23) 

 
The integration goes over the entire time of convection formation τ2. Therefore (23) 
may be written as: 

ρ′ = ρo (V∇pB/pB)τ2 ~ ρo(V/LB)τ2                                       (24) 

 
The perturbation of pressure p′ is determined from the equation of state: 

 

p′ = cs

2 ρ′,                                                                               (25 ) 

 
here cs is the velocity of the fast magnetosonic wave, since magnetic elasticity is of 
utmost importance in the magnetosphere. 
In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  velocity  of  fast  magnetosound  in  the  magnetosphere  is 
virtually equal to the Alfvén velocity, we find 

∇p′ ~ -ρo cs

2Vτ2/L2~ F ,                              ( 26) 

 
where F is the Ampere force. Since V ~ Fτ1/ρo, from (26) it follows that 

τ1τ2 = L2/cs

2                                                (27) 

 
This  relation  relates  the  size  of  the  system  to  the  settling  time  of  a  stationary 
distribution of pressure, i.e. to the formation of a gas pressure gradient. This is known 
to determine the current in plasma. 
In other words, τ2 is the characteristic time of penetration of the electric current into 
-1  ~  1  s,  L  ~  1010  cm,  and  for  cs  ~  3⋅108 
the  plasma  volume.  Assuming  for  τ1  =  ωB
cm/s, then for τ2 we find the time of ~1000 s. Such a duration of the transient process 
for  the  magnetosphere  is  unobjectionable.  It  turns  out  that  our  system  has  three 
characteristic times: τ1=2π/ω that characterizes the time of electric field buildup “at a 
point”, τ2 is the time of penetration of the electric field into the volume, and τ3 = L/cs 
is the settling time of the electric field in the system of the size L. It should be noted 
that  the  gas  pressure  gradient  is  also  produced  when  the  magnetic  field  is 
homogeneous but there is a wall that confines the motion of plasma. Furthermore, the 
expression (27) retains its form, and the time τ2 acquires an illustrative character. It is 
simply  the  filling  time  of  the  volume  between  the  wall  and  the  point  that  is  at  a 
certain  distance  from  the  wall,  with  plasma  moving  with  the  velocity  V  toward  the 
wall. 
     What has been said above suggests an important physical conclusion. The process 
of  penetration  of  current  into  plasma  is  a  two-stage  one.  Initially,  the  polarization 
field is produced, which penetrates into plasma “layer by layer”. Or, more exactly, the 
momentum corresponding to this field penetrates into plasma. Here, if the system is 
inhomogeneous, the flow can redistribute pressure in such a manner that an electric 
current  arises  in  plasma  because  of  the  appearance  of  gradients.  Energetically,  this 
current is necessary for maintaining convection in the inhomogeneous system. In fact, 
from the relation: 

V∇p = E j ,                                                    (28) 

 
it  follows  that  current  is  necessary  for  maintaining  flow  in  an  inhomogeneous 
medium.  If  (28)  is  integrated  over  the  volume  of  the  system,  we  see  that  in  a 
stationary case the consumed power: 
 

W = ∫ UV∇p dU = ∫ UdivS dU =∫ ∑S d∑ = ∫ ∑ψj d∑ ,                              (29)

where U and Σ are the volume and surface area of our system, and Ψ is the surface 
potential.  It  is  obvious  that  if  the  surface  is  closed  and  equipotential,  i.e.  ψ  can  be 
taken  outside  the  integral  sign,  then  the  system  is  energetically  isolated  from  its 
surroundings - no energy can be “pumped in” (or “pumped out”), since ψ∫ ∑ jd∑ =0. 
This  was  demonstrated  by  Heikkila  (1997)  .  We  use  (29)  to  estimate  the  power 
brought  into  the  magnetosphere  by  our  current,  with  an  appropriate  potential 
difference. When ∆ψ ~ 600 CGSE (~ 120 keV), jn1 ~ 5⋅10-5 CGSE and Σ ~ 1020 cm2, 
for  W  we  obtain  the  value  on  the  order  of  3⋅1018  ergs/s,  which  corresponds  to  the 
value adopted for the perturbed state of the magnetosphere. 
     We have repeatedly stressed that equation (28) has a profound physical meaning. 
If  Ej>0,  the  electric  forces  do  work  on  plasma.  Plasma  in  this  case  moves  toward 
increased pressure, that is, it is compressed. Otherwise the expanding gas produces an 
electric  power.  In  the  magnetosphere  there  are  MHD  compressors  as  well  as  MHD 
generators  (see  Fig.  3)  [Ponomarev,  2000;  Sedykh,  Ponomarev,  2002].    If  their 
combined  output  were  identical,  then  the  energy  balance  would  be  zero  and  the 
magnetosphere  would  not  need  any  external  energy  sources.  In  fact,  inside  the 
magnetosphere  is  a  constant  energy  consumer,  the  Earth’s    ionosphere.  It  is  known 
that  the  energy  flux  density  through  the  surface  is  proportional  to  the  electric  field 
component tangent to this surface. 
It  is  obvious  that  in  this  way,  by  changing  the  degree  of  nonequipotentiality  of  the 
magnetopause,  the  magnetosphere  can  control  the  energy  supplied  externally.  And 
the  importance  of  this  issue  is  thus.  One  can  imagine  that  the  intensity  of 
magnetospheric  processes  is  determined  by  the  power  alone,  which  is  “offered”  by 
the external source. Yet it may also be assumed that there exists also some regulator 
that  permits  the  passage  only  a  certain  part  of  the  “offered”  power.  Further,  if  this 
regular is linked to the consumer, then we have a very stable natural system.  
 
Conclusions 

 

     The arguments adduced above suggest the following conclusions. 
The bow shock can be a sufficient source of power for supplying energy to substorm 
processes.  The  direction  of  current  behind  the  BS  front  depends  on  the  sign  of  the 
IMF  Bz-component.  When  Bz  <  0  the  current  in  the  Bow  Shock  -  magnetosphere 
circuit  flows  in  the  clockwise  direction,  that  is,  in  the  nightside  part  of  the 
magnetosphere.  It  is  the  dawn-dusk  current;  when  Bz  >  0,  it  reverses  its  direction. 
Any  change  in  external  current  through  the  magnetosphere  causes  a  convection 
restructuring within a time on the order of the travel time of the magnetosonic wave 
from  the  magnetopause  to  the  center  of  the  system,  because  the  restructuring  wave 
comes from both flanks. In our model this implies the transition from the two-vortex 
to  four-vortex  convection  system.  Furthermore,  the  energy  possibilities  are  reduced 
strongly  for  the  intramagnetospheric  processes.  Until  a  new  distribution  of  gas 

pressure is established, the role of the force counteracting the Ampere force is played 
by  the  inertial  force.  This  corresponds  to  the  acceleration  of  plasma  and  hence  to  a 
change  of  the  electric  field.  In  our  opinion,  an  attempt  to  observe  the  restructuring 
wave  in  high  latitudes  with  radars  of  the  SuperDARN  system  or  with  TV  systems 
with a large angle of view would be worthwhile.

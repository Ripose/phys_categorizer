Optical pumping of 3He produces large (hyper) nuclear-spin polarizations independent of the magnetic

resonance imaging (MRI) field strength.  This allows lung MRI to be performed at reduced fields with

many associated benefits, such as lower tissue susceptibility gradients and decreased  power absorption

rates. Here we present results of 2D imaging as well as accurate 1D gas diffusion mapping of the human
lung using 3He at very low field (3 mT).  Furthermore, measurements of transverse relaxation in zero

applied gradient are shown to accurately track pulmonary O2 partial pressure, opening the way for novel

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging of the lung using hyperpolarized (HP) noble gases (3He or
129Xe) has advanced significantly: measurable quantities such as gas distribution,

diffusion and nuclear-spin relaxation have been shown to correlate with pulmonary

physiology, and clinical applications are being actively explored [1,2].  To date, almost

all in vivo studies have been performed in high field (Bo ~1.5 T) imagers, which are the

most prevalent owing to the demands of conventional MRI where signal-to-noise (SNR)

is proportional to Bo.  With HP MRI, however, optical pumping techniques produce a

nuclear magnetization that is independent of Bo and there exists no SNR benefit to

operation at 1.5 T [1]. On the contrary, HP MRI might be better served by operation at

lower magnetic fields where certain benefits may exist.  Most notably, local field

gradients, which are due to spatial variations in tissue susceptibility, decrease in going to

a lower imaging field.  Also, working at a reduced frequency reduces the RF power

absorbed by the body, thereby allowing the use of rapid pulse sequences without

exceeding safety limits.  Other proposed benefits have been described elsewhere [3,4],

and include the development of light weight, MR imagers for orientational lung study [5].

We began exploration of very low field HP MR in the human lung using a homebuilt

imager operating at 3mT [3].  Poor homogeneity of the B0 field, however, limited the

relevance of local diffusion measurements and prevented gas density imaging.   In this

work we employed a commercial whole-body imager (Sopha-Magnetech, nominally
designed for 0.1 T [6]), operating at reduced current to perform 3He MRI of the lung at

very low field.

Method

Measurements were made at 104.5 kHz  (3.222 mT) inside a copper mesh Faraday cage,

which  attenuated external noise signals by ~ 40 dB.  A standard laboratory power supply

was used to provide a stable current to the resistive magnet, and bipolar current

amplifiers (Kepco 50-8M and homebuilt) were used in lieu of the regular gradient

amplifiers, which were too noisy at this frequency.  The homebuilt transmit and receive
coils are described in Ref [3], along with the in-house methods of HP 3He gas production,

pulse sequence management, and data collection.  Measurements were performed using
typical quantities of 50 standard cm3 of ~ 30% polarized 3He diluted to 1 litre with N2;

the mixture was carried to the imager in a Tedlar plastic bag (Jensen Inert Products,

Coral Springs, Fl, USA).

Measurements were first performed in the bag to characterize B0 field homogeneity and

tipping pulse quality.  Loading the transmit coil with a human subject did not change the

quality factor (Q = 12) and, therefore, did not appreciably degrade the pulses. In vivo

measurements were performed, with informed consent on 3 healthy subjects, concordant

with approved protocol (CNRS 01 048).    While lying supine in the imager, the subject

exhaled normally, inhaled the gas directly from the bag, then inhaled air to fill the lung

and held his breath (typically 5 s or less) for signal acquisition.

Imaging was performed using a single-shot, spin-echo RARE sequence [6], while

transverse relaxation times were measured using a CPMG sequence [3,6].   For all
sequences, an initial 90o

x RF pulse (0.5 ms) was followed by a train of 180o

y RF pulses

(1.0 ms) at regular interval Tcp.  In a uniform field gradient G, the decay time T2´ of the

transverse magnetization in a CPMG sequence is given  by

where T2 is the intrinsic relaxation time of the system (with G = 0) and D is the

coefficient of diffusion [7].  In vivo, an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) replaces D.

† 

The factor k corrects for the time variation of the gradients, which were switched off

during RF pulsing to obtain spatially non-selective tipping angles.

Results

Preliminary CPMG measurements made on the bag in zero applied gradient showed the

B0 field to be of good homogeneity and the RF tipping pulses to be extremely accurate.

For a given Tcp, values of T2´ measured in the bag were an order of magnitude longer here

than in our homebuilt imager [3]; this confirmed that improved homogeneity at 3 mT (of

order 700 ppm) was attainable in switching to the Sopha-Magnetech imager. At the

shortest inter-echo time Tcp = 4.2 ms, thousands of spin-echoes could be re-focused, and

T2´ values exceeded 1000 s (of order the wall-induced longitudinal relaxation time T1)..

If, however, the decay time is assumed to be dominated by the effects of imperfect RF

pulses (Ref [3], Appendix A) then a T2´ ~ 1000 s puts an upper limit of ~ 4 ppm for the
loss in transverse magnetization per 180o spin-flip, which confirms the quality and

accuracy of the RF pulses.

1D Diffusion Mapping

Typical diffusion maps made along the x-, y- and z-axes (right to left, back to front and

foot to head respectively) are shown in Figure 1 along with FFTs of the initial spin

echoes, which give a 1D profile of the gas distribution at the begining of the sequence.

Values of ADC were extracted via a pixel-by-pixel analysis of the decays of the FFTs

[3].  Regional differences could be resolved, and were most notable in the y- and z-

directions.  Along z, ADC was larger in the apices of the lung.  Along y, ADC was

uniform except for a sharp increase at both extremities, which differs from the anterior to

posterior ADC decrease measured at 1.5T [8].  This may be due to the difference in

measurement method and probed length scale (0.6 mm in this experiment).

2D Projection Imaging

A coronal projection image, along with its 1D projections on the x- and z-axes, is shown

in Figure 2.  A single-shot, spin-echo sequence (RARE) was used to make maximum

efficiency of the polarization [6].  The 3 mT image is of modest quality: similar to the

pioneering 1.5 T images made seven years ago [9], yet a marked improvement from the

first very low field image at 15 mT which suffered from poorly shielded external noise

[4]. Still, we anticipate that image quality will quickly improve with better control over

other noise sources (via improved low frequency filtering of lines into Faraday cage) and
the use of larger quantities of 3He (300 cm3 with 40-50% polarization, as routinely used

at 1.5T).

Measuring O2 Partial Pressure with Fast Repetition CPMG

Sequence in Zero Applied Gradient

Taking advantage of the negligible power deposition at very low RF frequency, fast

repetition spin-echo sequences were used to monitor the MR signal decay with G = 0 in a

single subject.  At very low magnetic field, where susceptibility gradients play no role,
the CPMG relaxation time of 3He in the lung is constant at small Tcp and is only limited

by the oxygen dependent magnetization lifetime T1 [3]. This was observed here for Tcp <

50 ms, where T2´ values levelled off at ~ 25 s.  The resulting long decay time can be seen

in Figure 3 where half of the initial magnetization still remains after 19s, the point at

which the subject chose to exhale.
1/T1 of 3He is known to be proportional to the oxygen partial pressure PO2 by a constant x
= 3.8 x 10-4 s-1/mbar at 37 oC [10].   Signal decay was fit assuming a constant uptake of
O2 into the blood (ie. PO2= Po – Rt) as observed in 3He MRI measurements of T1 at 1.5 T

[11].  This nonexponential time dependence fits the data very well.  For the data of Figure

3, thenonlinear least squares fit gave an initial O2 partial pressure Po of 106.7 (5) mbar

and an uptake rate R of 1.01 (3) mbar/s.  The high degree of certainty in the fit parameters

stems from the large number of data points (~ 3200 echoes) despite a relatively low SNR

(~50).  To accommodate the fast RF pulse rate here, pre-amplifier gain had to be reduced
at the expense of SNR. When this technical difficulty is overcome, and if more 3He gas is

used, SNR values up to 1000 will become routine, thereby allowing Po and R to be

reliably extracted with a few seconds of data only (this is shown in the inset panels of

Figure 3 for simulated data).

Conclusion

In this article, we have presented 1D gas diffusion mapping as well as 2D imaging  of the
human lung using hyperpolarized 3He at 3 mT.  The results of the diffusion mapping are

sufficiently accurate as to distinguish regional differences in ADC.  The technical

difficulties limiting image quality in this study should be easy to overcome and

improvements  realized quickly.

We have also presented measurements of global O2 partial pressure and uptake rate made

using a fast repetition CPMG sequence in zero applied gradient.   With a readily

achievable increase in SNR, these measurements will only require a few seconds to

perform and use up only a fraction of the 3He magnetization. This opens up the very

exciting possibility of performing a regular imaging sequence (regional gas diffusion or

distribution map) as well as a high-accuracy global O2 determination (Po and R) all within

a single breath hold.This approach will further contribute to reduce examination time and
to make for a most efficient use of 3He, which is a non-renewable resource.  To extend

this technique so as to obtain regional O2 information as well, we envision the use of

small local coils or SQUID detectors arrayed across the chest.

Abstract 

Understanding 

the 

transition-crossing  process 

is  crucial  for 

improving  Booster 

performance at high intensity.  The synchronous phase appears to drop toward 90° right 

after  transition  regardless  of  beam  intensity,  more  so  at  higher  beam  intensity.    The 

implication  is  that  the  effective  rf  voltage  (RFSUM)  will  run  into  a  limit  right  after 

transition when the synchronous phase reaches 90° for high intensity beam.  A reduction 

in  RFSUM  is  also  observed  at  the  same  time.    Solutions,  such  as  raising  the  rf  voltage 

during  the  transition  period  or  controlling  the  RFSUM  reduction  by  increasing 

longitudinal  emittance  before  transition,  are  potentially  important  for  high  intensity 

operation. 

Introduction 

It  is  important  to  have  diagnostic  tools  to  measure  the  transition  time  and  monitor  the 

details  of  the  synchronous  phase  and  effective  rf  voltage  changes  during  the  transition-

crossing  rf  manipulations.    By  correlating  experimental  observations  with  Booster 

performance, Booster running conditions can be optimized, especially for high intensity 

beam.  A synchrotron phase detector in the low level rf room of the Booster measures the 

phase  between  the  rf  fundamental  component  of  the  beam  current  and  the  effective  rf 

voltage  with  a  time  resolution  of  one  microsecond.[1]    The  RFSUM  signal  gives  the 

effective  rf  voltage  acting  on  the  beam.[2]    The  combination  of  the  synchrotron  phase 

detector with the RFSUM signal provides not only the phase motion of the beam relative 

to the rf waveform but also the energy loss per turn during the transition crossing period. 

Observations 
The synchronous phase was measured at extracted beam intensities of 2.6×1012 protons, 

3.3×1012 protons, and 5.1×1012 protons using the synchrotron phase detector.  The results

are shown in Fig. 1.  The duration of the transition phase jump, about 16 µs, appears to be 

independent of beam intensity.  From the data shown in Fig. 1, the synchronous phase at 

these extracted beam intensities is plotted in Fig. 2(a) at three different times, right before 

transition,  right  after  transition,  and  when  the  synchronous  phase  has  reached  its 

minimum  at  about  60  µs  to  70  µs  after  transition.    The  phase  jump,  the  difference 

between the red curve and the black curve in Fig. 2(a), and the minimum phase change, 

the difference between the green curve and the black curve, are plotted in Fig. 2(b).  The 

RFSUM  signal,  taken  at  the  extracted  beam  intensity  of  4.1×1012  protons,  is  shown  in 

Fig.  3.    The  transition  crossing  period,  indicated  by  red  arrows,  is  about  14  µs.    This 

result is consistent with the one from the synchronous phase measurement.  An important 

feature appearing in both the synchronous phase measurement and the RFSUM signal is 

that  the  synchronous  phase  drops  closer  to  90°  right  after  transition  (see  Fig.  1)  at  the 

time of the RFSUM reduction, indicated by the green arrows in Fig. 3. Also, the energy 

loss  per  Booster  turn  can  be  obtained  from  the  combination  of  the  synchrotron  phase 

detector  signal  and  the  RFSUM  signal.[3]    The  energy  loss  per  turn  during  the  period 

near transition is shown in Fig. 4 for three extracted beam intensities of 2.6×1012 protons, 

3.3×1012 protons, and 5.1×1012 protons. 

Comments 

The duration of the transition phase jump is estimated to be about 14 µs to 16 µs from 

both  the  synchronous  phase  measurement  and  the  RFSUM  signal,  consistent  with  an 

estimate based upon the Q of Booster rf cavities, about 800 at transition.[4]  It takes about 

9.5  Booster  turns  for  the  phase  jump,  about  15.4  µs  since  the  revolution  period  at 

transition  is  1.615  µs.    The  phase  jump  is  dependent  upon  the  beam  intensity,  and  is 

shown by the black curve and green curve in Fig. 2(a).  The synchronous phase is closer 

to  90°  when  the  beam  intensity  goes  higher,  both  before  and  after  transition.    Note, 

however,  the  red  curve  in  Fig.  2(a)  indicates  that  the  higher  the  beam  intensity  is,  the 

closer  the  synchronous  phase  is  to  180°  right  after  transition.    These  two  observations 

seem consistent with the observation that the phase jump at transition is independent of 

the  beam  intensity,  as  shown  in  the  red  curve  of  Fig.  2(b).    However,  the  difference 

between  the  synchronous  phases,  which  are  closest  to  90°  before  and  some  tens  of 

 

2

microseconds  after  transition,  is  dependent  upon  the  beam  intensity,  as  shown  in  the 

black curve of Fig. 2(b). Thus, the higher the beam intensity, the more effective rf voltage 

is  required.    The  effective  rf  voltage  (RFSUM)  at  transition  could  become  the  limiting 

factor for the highest beam intensity in Booster. 

The RFSUM reduction after transition, shown by the green arrows in Fig. 3, is certainly 

related  to  the  observation  of  the  synchronous  phase  dropping  toward  90°  at  a  similar 

time,  consistent  with  the  increased  energy  loss  per  turn  during  the  transition  period,  as 

shown in Fig. 4.  This conclusion implies that it should help to get higher intensity beam 

after  transition  if  the  RFSUM  dip  at  transition  is  removed  or  reduced,  perhaps  by 

increasing  the  effective  rf  voltage  during  the  transition  period  or  by  intentionally 

increasing  the  longitudinal  emittance  to  reduce  the  energy  loss  caused  by  bunch 

shortening near transition.

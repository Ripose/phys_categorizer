The Projectile inside the Loop

The loop-the-loop demonstration1 is one of the favorite toys used in introductory 
physics courses. In this simple device a small sphere typically rolls down an incline and 
then continues around a circular track, which constitutes the “loop.” By using the 
principle of conservation of mechanical energy, students are usually asked to find the 
initial conditions that enable the moving body to “safely” make it around the loop.2 At 
times, I tried to ask my students an unusual question: “What happens to the body if it 
doesn’t go around the loop and falls inside it?” In this paper I will detail the answer to 
this question and describe a simple experimental activity related to this interesting 
problem. 
 
The student answers are usually contradictory. Some suggest that the object would 
simply fall straight down, after loosing contact with the rail of the loop. Others suppose 
that the body would continue to follow a somewhat circular trajectory in the air, with a 
different radius of curvature, compared to the loop radius. In general, many students fail 
to recognize that the object, once the contact with the rail is lost, simply follows the 
kinematical rules of a projectile motion. 

 
The Description of the Problem 

Consider the loop-the-loop apparatus, schematically described in Figure 1, composed 

2

I =

of an initial “ramp” and a circular track of radius R. In the actual demonstration a 
spherical object (represented by the red dot in the figure) of mass m, radius r and moment 
of inertia 
, starts moving from rest at a certain initial height, and then rolls down 
the ramp and inside the loop. We can assume a pure rolling motion without slipping, and 
neglect air resistance or any other energy loss in the motion.3 The red dot in the figure 
should actually represent the position of the center of mass of the rolling sphere, for 
which all the following analysis will apply. Alternatively, we can assume the radius r of 
the sphere being much smaller than the track radius R, so that a point-like object, as in 
Fig. 1, can represent the body. 

 
It is a well-known result that the minimum initial height required for the ball to make

, as measured from the bottom level of the loop. If the ball is 

the loop is exactly  R10
released from an initial height hi less than 2.7 R, it will not gain enough speed to 
complete the loop. At this point two options are still open: if the release height is in the 
range 
, the ball will simply rise to the same height inside the loop, and then 
keep oscillating back and forth, without ever losing contact with the track. The second 
option is the most interesting and related to our original problem. If the initial height is in 
the range 
 (indicated by the green bar on the y axis in Fig. 1), the ball will 
reach a position (denoted by point P and related angle θ, in Fig. 1) in the upper left

non-zero speed,  Pv . 

 
The contact with the track is lost at the point where the normal force N, of the track 

on the ball becomes zero, i.e., when the radial component of the weight alone will

while falling inside the loop.4 

 
An interesting position along the trajectory of this motion is represented by point H in 

Fig.1. This is the point at which the projectile is at the same level of the original launch 
position P. The horizontal distance  PH  can be evaluated, by using the well-known (but 
often misused by students) formula for the horizontal range of a projectile.5 Consider now 
the simple geometrical construction6 in Fig. 1, where the line PA is tangent to the circle at 
P, point P’ is at the same level of point P, segment P’A is drawn perpendicular to the 
tangent line and the vertical red line from A is intercepting the red horizontal line at H.

The previous equation, which applies for any possible value of the angle α (not just 

the case shown in figure), shows that point H can be found in general using the 
geometrical construction described above. In other words, to find H we simply draw the 
tangent to the circle at point P, then construct the perpendicular P’A from P’ to the 
tangent line, where P’ is a point on the circle at the same height of P. Point H will be the 
vertical projection of point A on the segment PP’, as illustrated in Fig. 1 and 
mathematically proven in Eq. 7. 
 

A Modified Loop-the-Loop Experiment 
 
The discussion presented above suggests a different use of the loop-the-loop 

apparatus (see Fig. 2), in which we follow and analyze the projectile trajectory. To test 
the theory we filmed the motion of the projectile-inside-the-loop with a digital video 
camera and video capture software (VideoPoint 2.5), and then used video editing 
software to produce a “stroboscopic” picture of the motion. Video clips and photos of the 
experiment can be viewed on a related web page.7  

 
Fig. 2 reproduces precisely the effect outlined in Fig. 1. The ball is launched from an

at which 
corresponding to an angle 
initial release level 
the ball is losing contact with the track. In this figure we obviously consider the motion 
of the center-of -mass of the sphere, so that the trajectory of the body is given at first by 
the black circle of radius R, somewhat smaller than the radius of the actual track. Apart 
from this difference the two figures represent essentially the same situation.

The ball then loses contact approximately at point P (for

the parabolic path in figure. The center-of-mass positions are indicated by the red dots in 
the same figure. Using equation (7) the horizontal distance PH is computed as

and the geometrical considerations presented above are valid in any case and can be 
easily tested. 
 

Conclusion 
 
The loop-the-loop apparatus can be used also to study the kinematics of the projectile 

motion in a rather unusual way. This projectile-inside-the-loop experiment can be 
effectively integrated into classroom demonstrations or become part of laboratory 
activities. It can be used to show interesting connections between topics such as rolling 
motion, conservation of mechanical energy and projectile motion.

3.  We recall that in a rolling motion of a rigid body without slipping, despite 

the presence of friction between the body and the track, no loss of mechanical 
energy occurs. This is due to the fact that the contact point is at rest relative to the 
surface at any instant. 

4.  In the particular case of 

 shown in Fig. 1, it is also easy to prove 
that the ball, after falling, will strike the track exactly at the bottom point of the 
loop. We leave the proof to the reader. This of course will not happen for other 
values of the angle θ.

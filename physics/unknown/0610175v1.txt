A 
trauma 
involves  the  fracture  and  dislocation  of 
the  zygomatic  bone,  with 
severe 
morphological  dysmorphosys.  It  can  be 
associated with a “blow-out fracture” of 
the  orbital  floor,  leading  to  a  limitation 
of  the  upper  eye  movement,  ocular 
injury  or  enophthalmia.  The  surgical 
correction 
is 
these 
undertaken  at  approximately  3-5  days 
after injury to allow swelling to subside. 
While  the  aim  of  the  procedure  is  to 
ensure the post-operative aesthetic of the 
patient  to  be  as  close  as  possible  to  its 
pre-trauma  state,  it  is  quite  difficult  to 
achieve due to the small operating field, 
reference 
the 
location, and the important swelling. 
 
One  of  the  topic  of  the  computer-aided 
maxillofacial  projects  developed  in  our 
group  [3,4]  is  then  to  address  the 

correction  of  these  fractures  of  the 
Zygomatic  bone,  which  includes  the 
definition  of  an  optimal 
surgical 
planning  and  the  development  of  a 
specific  navigation  system  for  intra-
operative guiding. 
 
This  paper  focuses  on  the  first  step, 
namely  defining  an  optimal  surgical 
planning  for  the  reconstruction  of  the 
fractured midface side. 
 
 
METHOD 
 
The  aim  of  the  surgical  procedure  is  to 
reconstruct  the  facial  skeleton  as  close 
as  possible  to  how  it  was  before  the 
fracture. Since no pre-traumatic data are 
available,  the  only  reference  to  the 
original  patient  morphology 
the 
healthy side of the face [6]. Although it

skeleton  of  normal  subjects  can  be 
reasonably  assumed  as 
symmetric. 
Therefore, an optimal surgical goal is to 
reposition the  fractured  zygomatic  bone 
respect 
symmetrically  with 
the 
unaffected  side  of 
the  patient.  A 
planning  protocol  is  proposed,  divided 
three-dimensional 
in 
reconstruction  from  CT  imaging,  bone 
fragment segmentation, mirroring of the 
facial

registration. 
 
1.  3D  reconstruction 
imaging 
 
The  computer-aided  protocol  rely  on  a 
CT  scan  of  the  midface.  3D  models  of 
the  skin  surface  and  the  facial  skeleton 
are  first  reconstructed  using  a  marching 
cubes  algorithm  [2].  Thresholds  for 
isosurface  generation  are  automatically 
set  with  reference  Housnfield  units, 
although  they  can  be  manually  set  to 
improve  the  segmentation  of  the  region 
of interest. 
 
2. Fragment segmentation 
 
Different  methods,  like  thresholding, 
mathematical  morphology,  and  region 
growing  algorithms,  were  investigated 
to  automatically  segment  the  fractured 
bone  in  the  CT  data.  However,  the 
zygomatic  fragment  is  generally  still 
connected  with  the  rest  of  the  skeleton, 
thus  very  difficult  to  isolate.  We  have 
finally  chosen  to  manually  extract  the 
fragment  using  a  sphere  define  by  four 
points  picked  on  the  3D  model  (fig.  1), 
which  rather  correspond  to  the  fracture 
points  on  the  maxillary,  orbital,  fronto-
sphenoidal and zygomatic processes.

zygomatic bone 

the 

This sphere always contains most of the 
zygomatic bone. To ensure no additional 
structures  are  segmented,  e.g.  a  bone 
splinter  or  a  part  of  coronoid  process 
(fig.  1),  only  the  greatest  object  within 
the  sphere,  the  malar  fragment,  is  kept. 
The  fracture  boundaries  may  not  be 
present,  but  they  are  generally  useless 
since they are rarely sharply defined. 
 
The  segmented  zygomatic  bone  is  the 
object  that  will  have  to  be  repositioned 
during  the  surgery.  For  the  next  step  of 
the  planning,  the  skull  mirroring,  it  is 
removed  from  the  3D  model  to  only 
keep 
structures 
non-affected 
surrounding the fracture. 
 
3. Skull Mirroring 
 
The  target  position  for  the  fractured 
bone  fragment  is  defined  by  mirroring 
the  healthy  side  of  the  skeleton  around 
the mid-sagittal plane. 
 
In axial CT slices, this plane is in theory 
orthogonal 
thus 
straightforward  to  compute.  However, 
the patient’s head is always tilted in the 
device  during  the  scanning  process, 
which  makes  the  images  asymmetric 
and quite difficult to analyse. The actual 
mid-sagittal  plane  must  therefore  be 
computed  out  of  the  patient  anatomy. 
The  surgeon  can  browse  through  the 
images  (the  native  axial  slices,  plus  the 
computed  sagittal  and  coronal  views) 
and the 3D models to manually identify 
several 
that 
belong  to  the  mid-sagittal  plane.  These 
landmarks  are  the  foramen  caecum,  the 
posterior extremity of the sphenoid crest 
and  the  middle  point  between  both 
can  be 
clinoid.  They

by  fractures  of 
the  facial  skeleton. 
Moreover, they are reliable,  precise and 
quite  easy  to  locate  on  CT  data.  A  first 
estimation of the plane is then computed 
out of these three points.

is  done  only  once,  and 
operation 
requires  up  to  thirty  seconds  for  185 
slices. 
 
To 
the 
mirroring, a registration algorithm [7] is 
used to match the mirrored healthy side 
with the bone structures surrounding the 
fractured  zygomatic  fragment.  These 
regions of interest are the orbital margin, 
the zygomatic process and the nasal area 
if  it  has  not  been  dislocated  with  the 
fracture.  They  are  manually  defined  by 
the  surgeon,  who  just  has  to  click  three 
or  four  points  on  the  3D  model  to 
determine 
rigid 
registration  is  then  performed,  which 
enable  to  overcome  the  errors  inherent 
to  the  limited  accuracy  of  the  manual 
plane  definition.  Thus,  an  elastic 
registration  enables  to  account  for  the 
natural  asymmetries  of 
facial 
skeleton,  and  ensures  the  continuity 
between  the  target  and  the  remaining 
bone  structures,  in  the  zygomatic  and 
orbital  areas  (fig.2,  right).  These  two 
registration steps are automatic, fast, and 
quite  robust  since  the  initial  position 
given by the initial mirroring process is 
excellent.

panel  shows  that  the  continuity  between  the  target  and  the  surrounding  bone  structures  is 
ensured, in the  zygomatic and orbital areas. 

 
 
Thanks  to  this  skull  mirroring  process, 
an  estimation  of  the  zygomatic  bone 
before  the  fracture  has  been  obtained, 
which will be used to guide the surgeon 
to replace the fractured bone during the 
surgery. 
 
4. Fragment registration 
 
To  evaluate  the  fracture  displacement 
and  the  correction  to  apply,  a  rigid 
registration  can  be  performed  between 
the  segmented  zygomatic  fragment  and 
its  target  position  (fig.  3). According  to 
the  fragment  dislocation,  a  manual  pre-
registration may be needed. 

 
 
RESULTS 
 
The  planning  process  has  first  been 
carried  out  on  four  patients  suffering 
from  fractures  of  the  zygomatic  bone 
and/or  the  orbital  floor.  Despite  some 
manual  interactions  are  required,  the 
overall planning time never exceeded 10 
minutes,  which  is  therefore  compatible 
with a use in clinical routine. 
 
Beside  the  feasibility  and  the  user-
friendly character of the application, the 
accuracy of the mirrored target has also 
been  evaluated  on  CT  scans  of  seven  
healthy  subjects  that  do  not  suffer  mid-

facial  fractures.  For  each  subject,  the 
zygomatic bone can be removed on one 
side of the face, to simulate patient data 
after  the  fragment  segmentation  step. 
After 
is 
performed,  the  distance  between  the 
surface  of  the  computed  target  and  the 
actual zygomatic bone is computed.  
 
This  validation  protocol  was  applied  on 
seven  healthy  subjects.  Considering 
either  right  or  left  mid-face  side  is 
healthy,  this  actually  provided  fourteen 
“patients”.  Five  of  the  subjects  have  an 
equilibrated  skull,  while  two  of  them 
suffer  from  a  dysmorphosys  or  a  non-
symmetrical  growth  of  the  skeleton, 
which  is  a  good  test  to  evaluate  the 
ability  of  the  method  to  account  for  the 
natural  asymmetries  of  the  skull.  The 
computed  mean  errors  (tab.  1)  are  1.06 
mm  in  mean,  with  a  maximum  a  2.23 
mm.  The  maximal  errors  never  exceed 
is  no  significant 
3.45  mm.  There 

difference between the patients suffering 
from  a  facial  dysmorphosys  and  the 
others. 
 
These  results  show  that  the  assumption 
of the facial skeleton symmetry seems a 
reasonable  base  for  the  planning,  even 
for non-equilibrated  patients. Moreover, 
the  further  local  registration  provides  a 
very  good  final  target  position  for  the 
zygomatic fragment repositioning.  
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
 
An optimal planning procedure has been 
proposed to define the target position of 
the zygomatic bone following a fracture 
of  the  mid-face  skeleton.  The  protocol 
has  been  successfully  tested  on  healthy 
the  global 
subjects, 
symmetry of the face could be obtained 
after the reconstructive surgery.

Now  that  the  planning  procedure  is 
available,  the  next  step  of  this  project 
will  be  to  develop  an  intra-operative 
guiding  system  to  help  the  surgeon  to 
follow  the  planning  [1].  This  procedure 
will  mainly  rely  on  the  intra-operative

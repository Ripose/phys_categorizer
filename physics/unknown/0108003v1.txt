Laser induced line narrowing effect in Doppler broadened systems was discovered thirty years ago. This effect
can also be applied to recent experimental studies in high resolution spectroscopy or high precision measure-
ments based on Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT). In this report we derive an analytic expression
for the linewidth of EIT resonance in a Doppler broadened system. It is shown here that the EIT linewidth is
proportional to the Rabi frequency of the driving ﬁeld and is independent of the Doppler width in a limiting
case. This recovers the result found in the laser induced line narrowing effect by Feld and Javan. In the other
limit, we recovers the usual power broadening case where the EIT linewidth is proportional to the intensity of
the driving ﬁeld and inversely proportional to the Doppler width.

Experiments in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency
(EIT) [1] have produced a ultraslow light propagation [2–4]
with spatial compression (group velocity less than 10’s m/sec)
and have made it possible to enhance nonlinear optical pro-
cesses by orders of magnitude [5–8]. Steepness of the disper-
sion function with respect to frequency plays the key role for
the small group velocity of light, and is directly related to the
transmission width [9–11]. Hence the behavior of the trans-
mission linewidth in terms of experimental parameters is of a
great deal of interest. In high resolution spectroscopy and high
precision magnetometry based on a narrow EIT line [12–17]
the experiments are usually carried out with atomic cell con-
ﬁgurations so that the effect of Doppler broadening on EIT is
also an important concern for the devices’ performance.

Due to the Doppler effect the atoms in a gas see the ra-
diation ﬁeld with shifted frequency. Hence the macroscopic
polarization representing medium’s response to the radiation,
needs to be averaged over the frequency distribution deter-
mined by velocity distribution of the atoms. The fact that
different atom sees different frequency of the radiation, has
made the Doppler broadening the pronoun of the inhomoge-
neous broadening. By and large, all sorts of phenomena in gas
laser are related to Doppler broadening [18] and it is also the
origin of the famous hole burning [19] and Lamb dip [20,21].
It was more than thirty years ago that the narrow feature
imposed on the Doppler broadened proﬁle has been studied
in detail. Laser induced line narrowing effect in a three-level
system was discovered by Feld and Javan [22]: Various as-
pects of this effect has been investigated by others [23–25],
and it was sometimes called ‘nonlinear interference effects’.
Notably Feld and Javan predicted the spectral width of the
narrow line to be linearly proportional to the driving ﬁeld Rabi
frequency (see Fig. 1). This feature has essential resemblance
with EIT experiments in gaseous media except that it dealt
with a gain medium.

On the other hand, the analysis of Doppler broadening ef-
fects in EIT was previously presented for a cascade system
[26]. Also similar studies on lasing without inversion in three-
level Λ and V-type systems [27], cascade system [28], and
in a four-level system [29]. The previous works, however,
mainly focused on the possibilities of absorption cancellation
and preferable conﬁgurations (copropagation of probe and
drive lasers in folded schemes, counterpropagation in cascade
scheme), and not on the transmission widths.

In this paper, we show, for the ﬁrst time, an explicit expres-
sion of the linewidth of EIT resonance in a Doppler broadened
three-level system, and the conditions for the dependence of
the linewidth on the driving ﬁeld strength. Doppler broaden-
ing is usually modeled by convolution of a given function over
a Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution. Due to the com-
plexity in the integration with a Gaussian distribution, how-
ever, explanations of the obtained results usually rely on nu-
merical analysis [26–29]. In order to obtain a simple expres-
sion of the linewidth, we approximate the usual Gaussian dis-
tribution with a Lorentzian function; this leads to rather sim-
ple form of inhomogeneously broadened susceptibility with
which detailed analysis is possible.

We ﬁnd two extreme cases: In one extreme the linewidth of
EIT resonance is proportional to the intensity of drive laser.
And in the other, it is proportional to the Rabi frequency of
drive laser, which recovers the result obtained by Feld and
Javan [22].

Let us consider the atomic model scheme depicted in Fig. 2.
In this three-level Λ scheme one of the two lower-levels (c)
is coupled to the upper level a by a coherent drive laser and
b is probed by a weak coherent ﬁeld. The
the transition a
atomic decays are, for simplicity, conﬁned in between the
given levels. Nevertheless, such a model gives a descrip-
tion almost equivalent to the one for an open system in which
atoms decay (out of the interaction region) with the same rate

!

γbc, but the upper level a decays much faster with rate 2γ, and
crucially, atoms are coming into the interaction region with
equally populated lower levels. Detailed comparison of our
model with the open system will be published elsewhere.

b (γ) and a

In the present analysis we use the following assumptions:
c (γ 0)
1) The decay rates in the transitions a
are assumed to be same (γ). The decay rate of the lower lev-
els b and c are same (γbc). 2) The probe ﬁeld is weak such
that the ﬁrst order analysis is valid. 3) The driving ﬁeld is on
resonance for a stationary atom. 4) The probe ﬁeld and driv-
ing ﬁeld propagate in the same direction. And the frequency
difference between the transitions a
c is small
enough such that the residual Doppler shift can be ignored.
5) The EIT condition for the homogeneously broadened sys-
tem is valid [i.e., Ω2
γγbc where Ω is the Rabi frequency
of the driving ﬁeld]. 6) The inhomogeneous linewidth (W D)
Ω. No further assumptions
is large enough such that WD
are made for the parameters.

Note that the analysis of cascade scheme [26] cannot be ap-

in the cascade scheme, the assumption that all the population
is in the ground state (level b) is valid for the cascade scheme,
but not for this Λ scheme where the level c and b are close to
each other.

The earlier work [22] dealt with a laser gain system where
the weak transitions between the lasing levels were used. The
decays out of the lasing levels were the main relaxation for
these systems while the spontaneous decay between levels
was not taken into account. These so-called open systems
have the relaxation of low-frequency coherence (γ bc) the same
order of magnitude as the population relaxation (γ). In the case

Many recent experiments [3,4,10,11,14–17] were per-
formed in alkali vapors where the ground state hyperﬁne
structures were used to create the lower-level coherence and
population relaxation of excited states is mostly due to spon-
taneous emission. In these so-called closed systems, however,
the ground state relaxation time is long enough, the lower-
level coherence is mainly governed by the time of ﬂight of
the atom through the interaction region. In Fig. 2, we plot
the EIT linewidth as a function of the Rabi frequency of the
driving ﬁeld. We note that ΓEIT
Ω
γ for any value of
γ leads to smaller value of Ω
Ω. Apparently, smaller ratio γbc=
for which linear dependence (Γ EIT

dependence (ΓEIT

So far we have seen that the parameter x

First, let us suppose the system is homogeneously broad-
ened. The optical pumping rate from the level c to b is Ω 2
γ
for the resonant driving ﬁeld.
In order to have a complete
optical pumping within the homogeneous linewidth, this rate
should be much greater than the pumping from level b to c:
Ω2
γbc. This means that the driving ﬁeld should be sufﬁ-
ciently strong: Ω2

γbcγ.
Now for atoms with velocity v, the optical pumping rate is

Abstract—A  lumped-parameter  impedor-oriented  and  a  2-
port-network-oriented  circuit  models  for  the  Sierpinski  gasket 
prefractal  antenna  are  presented.  With  the  former,  the  voltage 
and  current  patterns  give  a  detailed  understanding  of  the 
electromagnetic  fields’  self-similar  distribution  throughout  the 
antenna  geometry;  on  the  other  hand  model  complexity 
exponentially  increases  with  the  prefractal  iteration  order.  The 
latter  “black-box”  model  only  controls  port-oriented  global 
parameters  which  are  the  ones  commonly  used  in  antennas’ 
circuit  models  and  its  complexity  is  independent  of  prefractal 
order.  The  “black-box”  model  is  also  shown  to  converge,  at 
fractal limit, to a reciprocal triangular network.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

F 

RACTAL  antennas  have  been  studied,  built  and 
commercialized  for  a  considerable  while.  The  fractal 
geometry (i.e. the replication of the same set over and over on 
infinitely  decreasing  length  scales  [1],  [2])  of  a  cavity  or 
radiating element as well is responsible for the self-similarity 
of  its  spectrum,  in  both  the  continuous  [3]–[5]  and  discrete 
cases  [6].  For  example,  properly  synthesized  fractal  antennas 
feature  multi-band  properties,  as  several  theoretical  and 
experimental  studies  confirmed  [7]–[14].  In  particular,  some 
radio-
devices 
communication  systems  based  on  Sierpinski  gasket-like 
geometries have a log-periodic behaviour as far as both input 
parameters and radiation patterns are concerned.

Fractal geometries used in electromagnetic applications are 
usually generated via Iterated Function Systems (IFSs), i.e. the 
infinite  recursion  of  a  contraction  mappings’  sequence  to  an 
initiator  domain  [1].  The  limit  fractal  set  cannot  be  used  to 
model real structures as such infinitely small length-scales are 
neither  physically  plausible  nor  practically  realizable.  Real 
structures are produced by stopping the IFSs’ iteration up to a 
finite step and the obtained domain is thus called a prefractal.

Two  network-based  methods 

the  analysis  of 
electromagnetic  Sierpinski  gasket-like  structures  will  be 
presented here: a lumped-parameters one (see Chapter III) and 
a  “black-box”  one  (see  Chapter  IV).  They  are  presented  as 
depending on the prefractal order of the structure (i.e. the step 
which  the  IFS  was  stopped  at),  such  that  the  asymptotic 
behaviour of electric parameter, as long as the prefractal tends 
to  the  limit  fractal  set,  are  highlighted  and  made  comparable 
with efficiency and production costs. 

II.  FROM SELF-SIMILAR GRAPHS TO ELECTRIC CIRCUITS 

A.  Self-similar graphs 

The  graph-analogue  to  an  IFS  (but  without  any  ‘metric’ 
information)  is  a  mapping  T:G→Gp,  where  G=(N,L)  is  a 
finite  or  countable,  simple  graph  (for  the  sake  of  the  electric 
theory discussed from Subsection II.C on, it can also be non-
simple),  and  Gp=(⊕pN,Lp).  For  basic  graph  definitions  see 
Appendix. 

The  node  set  of  Gp  is  simply  ⊕pN:=N⊕N⊕…⊕N  (p 
times); this stands for the nodes of Gp being p “copies” of G’s 
ones. The set Lp is, by definition of graph, a subset of the set 
⊕pN×⊕pN,  but  it  can  also  be  a  superset  of  the  Lp  (cartesian 
product  of  L  by 
in  general, 
Lp⊆Lp⊆⊕pN×⊕pN:  this  reflects  the  fact  that  each  “copy”  of 
the original graph is intra-connected the same way, but map T 
might  add  links  between  nodes  of  different  “copies”  (usually 
determining the connectedness of graphs Gp, for any p, if G is 
connected as well). 

itself  p 

times) 

so, 

Let  G0=(N,L)  be  such  a  finite  graph  (oriented,  for 
generality’s sake), let Gn=Tn(G0) ∀n∈N, and H0∈MCardN(Z3) 
its skew-symmetric incidence matrix (hereinafter let ‘CardA’ 
be the number of elements of set A). Whatever is the chosen 
ordering  of  the  nodes,  provided  that  the  nodes  of  each  copy 
either  “follow”  or  “precede”  those  of  the  other  copies  (and 
their  inner  ordering  is  the  same  of  G0),  the  incidence  matrix 
Hn of the nth iteration Gn, as shown in [15]–[17], is computed 
as: 

 

H

n

=

V
n

H −
n

,    ∀n∈N. 

(1) 

p

+ ⊕

Thus  Hn  is  a  quasi-diagonal-block  matrix,  whose  p  diagonal 
blocks  are  all  equal  to  the  incidence  matrix  of  the  (n−1)th 
iterate, which a sparse matrix Vn is added to. Latter matrix is 
nonzero  only 
the  copies  of  each  graph  get  some 
interconnections  under  T  (i.e.  the  G1’s  link-set  is  larger  than 

if 

WMß0022-E 
 

just  p  copies  of  G0’s  link-set).  If  G0  has  a  finite  number  of 
nodes, then Gn has pnCardG0 nodes, which is the number of 
columns  and  rows  of  Hn  and  Vn  as  well.  The  number  of 
nonzero  elements  in  Vn  is  twice  the  number  of  inter-
connections between the copies of the original graph for every 
new iteration1. 

The infinite graph obtained by infinitely composing map T 
with  itself  is  called  the  self-similar  graph  of  T,  since  its 
incidence  relation  is  similar  under  all  of  its  subcopies’ 
hierarchies and is formally indicated as a ‘limit graph’:

The  self-similar  structure  of  Gn  graphs  (∀n∈N)  is  thus 
reflected  in  the  multiscale  structure  of  their  incidence 
matrices,  as  the  Vn  matrices  have  a  ‘dilated’  sparseness 
depending on n, and the diagonal blocks are all copies of the 
previous-iteration  matrices.  The  finite  iterations  of  T  are 
usually called prefractal graphs, in analogy with IFSs. 

B.  The Sierpinski gasket graph 

The Sierpinski gasket graph is any limit graph obtained by 
recursively  copying  three  times  (p=3)  any  simple  3rd-order 
graph  and  adding  three  links  among  these  copies  [15].  As 
initiator,  a  complete  3rd-order  graph,  i.e.  a  triangle  graph,  is 
considered, and the action of the map is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Sierpinski gasket prefractal graphs Šn, 0≤n≤5. 
 

A  smart  algorithmic  nodes’  ordering  method  consists  in 
choosing  either  one  of  the  two  orientations  for  the  original 
triangle  graph  Š0  (e.g.  the  clockwise  one)  and  assigning  one 
ternary (base-3) digit to each of the nodes: 03, 13 and 23. Then 
every node of the nth-iteration graph Šn is inductively labeled 
with  an  (n+1)-digit  ternary  integer,  whose  n  less  significant 
digits  reflect  the  node  ordering  of  its  main  3  copies  (i.e. 
according  to  the  inner  ordering  of  Šn−1)  and  the  most 
significant  digit  orders  the  three  copies  themselves  (e.g. 
clockwise). 

Š1  is  thus  made  up  of  three  copies  of  Š0:  the  nodes  of  the 
‘first’ copy are labeled 003=0, 013=1 and 023=2; nodes of the 
‘second’  copy  103=3,  113=4  and  123=5;  nodes  of  the  ‘last’ 
copy  203=6,  213=7  and  223=8;  and  so  on  for  Šn,  ∀n∈N, 
which has 3n+1 nodes.

To  complete  the  description  of  such  graphs,  incidence 
matrices are singular ∀n∈N0 and the links of Šn are counted to 
be 3(3n+1−1)/2 (so the graph is totally connected). 

C.  From incidence to admittances 

This paragraph only summarizes the basics of a well known 
circuit  theorists’  method  to  solve  lumped-parameters  circuit 
equations called the nodes’ method [18] and its strong linking 
with  graph  theory.  It  can  also  be  extended  to  distributed-
parameters  circuits.  As  long  as  electrically  linear  impedor 
elements alone are involved, such a network is represented by 
a  finite  (N  nodes  and  L  links)  non-ordered  graph  with  every 
link  associated 
impedor,  whose  Laplace-domain 
admittance  y(s),  s∈C,  is  the  transfer  function  between  its 
voltage V(s) and current I(s). The graph has P∈N connected 
components, but electrical constraints are imposed between.

the  symmetric 
admittances’  matrix  Y(s)  whose  kth  diagonal  element 
(1≤k≤N−P) is the sum of the admittances on all the kth-node-
related  links,  and  the  (i,j)th  triangular  element  (i≠j)  is  the 
sign-reversed sum of the admittances between ith and jth node.

Symbolically,  admittances’  and  incidence  matrices  are 
related  to  each  other:  they  both  have  the  same  zero  elements 
(presence of an impedor is equivalent to incidence of its two 
nodes),  but  the  former  is  symmetric,  the  latter  is  skew-
symmetric. Diagonal elements are 0 because cycles (links of a 
node to itself) are not allowed in such graphs. 

III.  ENDOSCOPIC MODEL OF THE SIERPINSKI GASKET 
 

y(cid:45)(s) 

as defined in Subsection II.B. The modeled electric network is 
recursively built starting from Š0, which is a triangular circuit 
whose 3 links have the same impedor admittance y(cid:45)(s), then 
adding appropriate feeding impedors (read below and cfr. Fig. 
2). The interconnection links between the previous iteration’s 
3 copies all have y•(s) impedor admittance. 

Šn  has,  ∀n∈N0,  3  distal  nodes  (its  geometrically,  but  not 
path-wise,  farthest  vertices).  As  shown 
in  Fig.  2  an 
independent outward-oriented current generator Ig(s), together 
with  its  parallel  admittance  yg(s),  is  attached  to  distal  node 
00…03=0;  their  other  end  is  grounded  and  chosen  as 
reference  node  (indicated  as  ‘(cid:58)’  in  Fig.  2,  cfr.  Subsection 
II.C).  Distal  nodes  11…13=(3n+1−1)/2  and  22…23=3n+1−1 
are  both  attached  to  load  admittances  yL(s),  and  whence 
grounded [20].

A.  Homogeneous Sierpinski gasket circuit 

Geometric  graph  self-similarity  produces  a  self-similar 

distribution  of  electric  quantities  throughout  the  circuit,  even 
in  the  simple  case  of  a  permanent-regime  feeding  and 
modeling  Šn  as  a  homogeneous  network,  i.e.  using  identical 
impedors y(cid:45)(s)≡y•(s)≡yL(s). In this case there is a complete 
proportionality  between  node  voltages  and  the  impedors’ 
impedances.  The  simplest  model  employs  a  purely  resistive 
network,  y(cid:45)(s)=y•(s)=yL(s)≡R−1>0,  an 
ideal  generator 
yg(s)≡∞  and  constant  (DC)  feeding  Ig(s)≡I0.  The  linear 
system to solve is thus purely numerical,

Self-similarity  is  well  reflected  in  the  admittances’  matrix 
and in its inverse as well, which is represented in Fig. 3 as a 
grayscale image whose dots’ brightness is proportional to the 
magnitude of the matrix elements for n=9. 

A self-similar block structure in the matrix is still observed: 
different scaling between diagonal and non-diagonal blocks is 
present, each one associated to the electric behaviour of every 
subnetworks’ hierarchies in the Sierpinski gasket circuit. This 
result,  obtained  with  the  nodes’  method  shown  in  Chapter  II 
and  based  on  just  a  few  general  assumptions  about  the 
circuit’s  electrical  conditions  (in  DC  regime),  was  first 
observed in 2001 [15], and the same structure of the resolvent 
matrix  was  found  using  a  new  discrete-topology  method  for 
field  equations  called  Topological  Calculus  [5],  [15],  [21].  It 
is also nonetheless coherent with numerical results obtained in 
[22]  with  a  full-wave  method  of  moments  (MoM)  simulation 
of a prefractal Sierpinski gasket antenna. 

The  self-similar  distribution  of  such  voltages  Vn  and  (by 
simple constraints on the ideal resistors of the circuit) of link 
currents  In  are  shown  in  Fig.  4  for  the  case  n=9.  Direct 
inspection  of  latter  figure  easily  shows  that  the  currents 
propagate  with  the  same  diffusion  pattern  along  each  of  the 
triangular  sub-networks’  9  hierarchies  and,  by  Babinet’s 
Theorem, are zero at the central vertical symmetry axis of the 
circuit  (triangle  height  of  the  00…03-labeled  triangle  vertex). 
Currents’  distribution  is  also  in  accordance  with  numerical 
results  obtained  via  a  scattering-matrix  transmission-line 
approach to the Sierpinski gasket antenna  [23].

is  carried  out  using  reactive  impedors  too.  For  instance,  the 
dependence  on  feeding  frequency  can  be  studied  assuming 
that  the  y(cid:45)(s)  impedors,  associated  to  each  of  the  antenna’s 
triangular patches, are purely dissipative elements (resistors of 
resistance  R>0)  while  the  y•(s)  impedors,  modeling  the

Used test values are R=1 µΩ, L=0.1 µH and C=1 nF (thus 
  rad,  νres(cid:17)15.91  MHz).  An  ideal  generator  is  still 

ωres=108
considered, so yg(s)≡∞. 

The admittances’ matrices are shown in Fig. 5 for different, 
almost-resonating  values  of  frequency  ν;  dots’  brightness 
displays the modulus of the various matrix elements.. 

The resonating circuit, i.e. at ν = νres, formally behaves like 
the  homogeneous  model  introduced  in  Subsection  III.A,  but 
different,  self-similar  currents’  distribution  is  observed  for 
different values as well. 

IV.  BLACK-BOX MODEL OF THE SIERPINSKI GASKET 

A.  Self-similar N-port networks 

An  alternative  method  for  circuit  models  of  self-similar 
structures  is  here  proposed.  As  opposed  to  the  one  in 
Subsections  III.A,B,  this  method  uses  multi-port  networks  as 
initiators,  whose  global  electric  parameters  are  known  (e.g. 
impedance  matrix)  instead  of  the  fine  structure  inside  the 
electric circuit itself; that is why it is a somewhat “black-box” 
model. 
Let

always produce physically meaningful impedance matrices.

Map  T  models  the  construction  of  a  new  N-port  network 
starting from the initiator network (or more copies of it, as is 
the case of self-similar networks). 

Once a suitable complete function space is chosen for such 
matrices,  conditions  for  map  T  such  that  the  iteration 
procedure still converges to a fixed attractor N-port network 
for  a  subset  of  initial  N-port  networks  (i.e.  a  basin  of 
attraction  in  the  dynamical  systems’  language)  can  be 
imposed.

Subsection II.C). RQ[s] is the space of real algebraic functions of variable s∈C 
(although the elements of such a matrix have further restrictions depending on 
the inner electrical network structure).

still having the required properties, consists in proving T to be 
a contraction in the chosen complete function space (defining 
the above limit operator as well) [2]. 

Map  T  usually  “entangles”  the  elements  of  the  matrix 
iterates,  leading  them  to  have  a  self-similar  functional 
structure  which,  if  a  limit  matrix  exists,  must  converge  to 
stable formulas under the choice of the initiator matrix Z0(s). 

In  this  sense  such  a  map  setting  can  be  regarded  as  the 
multi-port-network  equivalent  of  an  IFS;  the  limit  network 
and  those  obtained  under  any  finite  iterations  are  called  self-
similar and prefractal N-port networks, respectively. 

A  similar  approach  for  the  computing  of  the  scattering 
matrix  of  a  triangular  initiator  transmission-line  network  was 
proposed  [23]:  the  network  was  built  with  a  recursive 
paradigm  analogue  to  the  Sierpinski  one  shown  in  Figs.  6–7 
and  introduced  below  in  Subsection  IV.B  for  the  impedance 
matrix  instead.  A  network-based  iterative  model  for  a 
Sierpinski carpet’s impedance matrix was also proposed [24].

The  action  of  š ζ  on  an  unbalanced  2-port  network 
impedance  matrix  Z0(s)  is  the  impedance  matrix  Z1(s)  of  an 
unbalanced 2-port network made up of 3 copies of it, mutually 
linked  according  to  the  topology  depicted  in  Fig.  6,  using 
interconnection  passive  impedors  of  impedance ζ(s).  In  this 
case map š ζ is the analog of map T as defined in Subsection 
IV.A. 

Iterating  š ζ  map  over  and  over  produces  the  impedance 
matrices’  sequence  (Zn(s))n∈N  of  Sierpinski  prefractal  2-port 
networks. A simpler model can be obtained by short-circuiting 
network’s copies, i.e. letting ζ(s)≡0, as shown in Fig. 7.

The  impedance  matrices  associated  to  the  Sierpinski 
network  model  get  rescaled  (which  technically  means  using 
smaller and smaller networks) and the limit impedance matrix 
is that of a triangular (or “π”) network whose three impedors 
all  have  impedance  z∞(s)  and  which  only  depend  on  the 
initiator  matrix  Z0(s).  This  also  physically  means  that,  no 
matter what kind of non-reciprocal starting network is chosen, 
the  limit  Sierpinski  network  is  always  reciprocal  (as  its  limit 
impedance matrix is symmetric) and homogeneous (i.e. made 
up  of  identical  impedors),  regardless  of  the  starting  network. 
z∞(s)  impedance  exists  thanks  to  the  3/5  rescaling  factor, 
otherwise the matrix sequence would be diverging; cfr. Fig. 8.

The same result can be proven as the limit matrix must be 
the  fixed  point  for  the  3/5-rescaled  Sierpinski  network,  thus

C.  Numerical results and a “toy model” 

Numerical  simulation  of  the  Sierpinski  network  model’s 
convergence  was  performed.  Random  starting  complex 
matrices  (both  symmetric  and  non-symmetric)  were  used.  
Figure  9  shows  the  values  of  the  four  impedance  matrix 
elements  versus  the  iteration  order  n.  Convergence  is  always 
reached in around 30−40 iterations, no matter what the matrix 
magnitude  is,  with  diagonal  elements  relaxing  on  the  same 
value, double of the common value for anti-diagonal elements.

A  “toy  model”  for  this  iterative  network  paradigm  is 
presented at last to show some algebraic properties of šζ map.

The  wording  “toy”  is  due  to  the  chosen  parameters’ 
normalization  for  this  example  (R=1Ω,  L=1H,  C=1F), 
which  is  physically  unfeasible.  Introducing  a  rescaling,  such 
impedance matrix can be made physically meaningful (and the 
graph  shown  in  Fig.  10  is  mathematically  similar  to  a  real 
one),  but  with  these  values  some  closed-form  symbolic 
computations  can  be  carried  out.  The  dynamics  of  šR  map  is

The  elements  of  symmetric  matrix  iterations  Zn(s)  are  all 
rational functions with integer, symmetric coefficients and the

V.  CONCLUSION 

With  a  full,  lumped-parameters  circuit  model,  as  the 
“endoscopic model” presented in Section III, the voltage and 
current  distributions  give  a  detailed  description  of  the 
electromagnetics within and the power distribution inside the 
network, once it is suitably tuned. As the number of nodes in a 
self-similar  graph  exponentially 
the 
complexity 
to 
Subsection III.A is mainly due to the inversion of a 3n+1×3n+1 
admittances’  matrix,  symbolically  depending  on  Laplace’s 
variable s∈C (i.e., practically, from the signals’ velocity ω∈R, 
for s = iω ≡ 2πiν ). 

increases  with  n,

This  model  was  also  shown  to  both  independently  agree 
with a full-wave MoM analysis [22] and a different scattering-
matrix model [23] for Sierpinski gasket antennas. 

On  the  other  hand  the  “black-box”  model  presented  in 
Chapter IV always produces a single multi-port network built 
from  several  copies  of  the  previous  iteration  network.  Model 
complexity is, a priori, always restricted to the fixed number 
of  ports  N  (in  the  case  of  the  Sierpinski  network,  it’s  a  2×2 
impedance  matrix)  although  only  global  parameters  (i.e. 
referred  to  every  port’s  degrees  of  freedom)  can  be  usually 

11 Any poles not possessed by immittance matrices’ diagonal elements are 
called private: their presence may invalid a dynamical system’s inner stability.

extracted. These parameters are, on the contrary, the ones that 
are searched for whenever a circuit model is employed for the 
synthesis  of  planar  or  linear  antennas,  such  as  the  input 
impedance. 

Of course the two methods coincide whenever the initiators 
are  electrically  the  same  (e.g.  the  triangle-shaped  electric 
circuit  Š0  is  an  unbalanced  2-port  network  with  the  ground 
node  as  unbalanced  pin  and  using  the  same  iterative 
paradigm),  but  once  the  “black-box”  model  is  computed, 
antenna parameters are more easily extractable from the latter. 
Such models were used to show the convergence properties 
of  Sierpinski  gasket-based  networks  which,  in  the  high 
iteration  order  limit  (n  ≈  40,  cfr.  Subsection  IV.C),  always 
relax to a (reciprocal) triangular homogeneous network, which 
is  arguable  comparing  the  current  distributions  of  Fig.  5  (at 
just the 9th iteration) with the limit structure of Fig. 9. This can 
be  useful  when  synthesizing  a  simpler  circuit  model  for  a 
fractal  antenna  whose  project  constraints  depend  on  the 
iteration  (i.e.  prefractal)  order:  as  circuit’s  complexity  and 
cost  increase  with  it,  a  proper  evaluation  of  a  required 
minimum iteration order n is needed. 

APPENDIX 

The  purpose  of  this  appendix  is  just  to  clarify  the  graph 

terminology and symbols used in Sections II and III. 

In  mathematics,  a  graph  is  an  algebraic  abstract  object 
defined  this  way:  let  N  be  a  non-empty  set  (whose  elements 
are  called  nodes),  L  be  any  other  set  (even  empty,  whose 
elements  are  called  links)  and  a  relation  @⊆L×N2  which  is 
left-total and right-universal12, called incidence. Such a 3-plet 
G=(N,L,@) is called a graph. G is said to be [in-]finite if so 
are  both  N  and  L;  non-oriented  if  l@(m,n)  ⇔  l@(n,m)  (i.e. 
links  are  associated  to  a  non-ordered  couple  of  nodes); 
connected if ∀m ∃n, ∃l: l@(m,n) (i.e. every node is associated 
at least one link); simple if ‘@’ is 1-way (i.e. there cannot be 
more than one link per couple of nodes). G is complete if it is 
connected  and  simple  at  the  same  time  (i.e.  every  couple  of 
nodes are incident to each other). 

The  case  of  non-oriented  graphs  is  much  simpler  because 
the link-set can be roughly identified with a subset of nodes’ 
couples, i.e. @≅L⊆N2. Incidence ‘@’ becomes an equivalence 
relation and G=(N,L). For a simple, non-oriented graph to be 
connected,  CardL>CardN  condition  is  required,  whereas

A  graph  with  no  closed  paths  (or  cycles,  or  circuits  in 
mathematics)  is  called  a  tree.  Let  G=(N,L)  be  a  finite,

and whose link-sets TL are generated by adding links of L one

that l@(n′,n″), l@(m′,m″), n′≠m″ ⇒ (n′,n″)=(m′,m″). That is, each link is 
associated to no more than one orderless couple of nodes.

them  and  such  graphs,  such  that  algebraic  properties  of  the

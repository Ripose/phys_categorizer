Abstract:

  An Alvaretz-type DTL, to accelerate the H - ion beam from
3  to 50  MeV, is being  constructed  as  the  injector  for  the
JAERI/KEK  Joint  Project. The  following  components  of
the DTL have been developed: (1) a cylindrical tank, made
by copper electroforming; (2) rf contactors; (3) a pulse-ex-
cited quadrupole magnet with a hollow coil made by cop-
per electroforming; (4) a switching-regulator-type pulsed-
power supply for the quadrupole magnet. High-power tests
of the components have been conducted using a short-model
tank. Moreover a breakdown experiment of the copper elec-
trodes has been carried out in order to study the properties
of several kinds of copper materials.

1. INTRODUCTION

  Construction has started of an Alvaretz-type DTL, to ac-
celerates the H - ions from 3 to 50 MeV, as the injector as
part of the JAERI/KEK Joint Project at the high-intensity
proton accelerator facility in Japan. The  DTL consists of
three long tanks (maximum 9.9 m in length), each of which
is comprised of three short unit tanks (approx. 3 m in length),
to overcome difficulties with constructing the tank and as-
sembling the drift tube. The resonance frequency of the DTL
is 324 MHz. The rf pulse length is 600 µsec and its repeti-
tion rate is 50 Hz. The main design parameters of the DTL
are summarized in Table-1 [1]. This report describes three
aspects of the DTL construction; rf contactors, the charac-
teristics of the copper surface of the cavity, and the power
supply for the quadrupole magnet in the drift tube.

2. RF CONTACTOR

  Two types of rf contactor have been developed: (a) a con-
tactor between the end plate and the tank cylinder; and (b) a
contactor between the stem of the drift tube and the tank.

Cross-sectional views of the contactors are shown in Figure
1. The structure is very simple: a thin copper layer (0.5 mm
in thickness) surrounds a  stainless steel spring. There is a
vacuum seal outside the  rf contactor. The performance of
these was checked initially by a small test cavity and then
by the large cavities that are described in the next section.

3. VACUUM AND RF PROPERTIES OF

THE TEST TANK

  The cavity cylinder for the DTL is made of iron, with the
inner surface covered by a copper layer (0.5 mm in thick-
ness)  t hat  was  built  by  the  Periodic  Reverse  (PR)
electroforming using pure copper  sulphate bath, and then
finished by  electropolishing [2]. A cylindrical cavity was
made  to  test  the  vacuum  and  the  rf  properties  of  the  PR
copper electroforming surface. The size of the cylinder (560
mm in diameter, 3320 mm in length) is almost identical to
that of the  longest unit tank of the DTL. The rf contactor
described in the previous section is used for the end plates.
  The measured unloaded Q-value of the TM 010 mode of the
cavity is 77000, which represents approximately 97  % of
the  value  obtained  by  analytical  calculations. The  results
indicate that (a) the electrical quality of the copper surface
is sufficiently high and (b) that the  rf  contactor functions
satisfactorily at a low rf-power level.
  Vacuum property was also measured,  and as the results in
Figure 2 show, the pressure level of the tank became 10-5 Pa
after  100  hours  of  evacuation.  The  outgas  rate  from  the
tank surface was also measured by an integration method

(build-up test)  and  the data is presented in Figure  3. The
outgas rate for the 2nd measurement was 5.2x10-8 Pa m 3/s/
m2 (3.9x10-11 Torr l/s/cm2 ), which is closely consistent with
the value for the OFC.

4. QUADRUPOLE MAGNET AND

PULSED-CURRENT SUPPLY

    One  of  the  most  important  devices  for  the  DTL  is  the
quadrupole magnet in the drift tube. We have developed a
compact quadrupole electromagnet with a hollow coil made
by the PR copper electroforming.  Because the magnet is
operated in pulse mode to decrease the heating due to ohmic
loss in the coil, the pole piece of the magnet is made from a
stack of silicon steel plate (0.35 mm and 0.5 mm in thick-
ness). Details of the magnet are reported in reference [3].
  A pulsed-current supply with a 20 kHz switching regula-
tor circuit (IGBT elements are  used)  has  been  developed
for the magnet. The requirements for the current supply are
as follows: (1) current stability, with the flat top of the out-

ply. (1000A)

(c) output voltage, (d) deviation of the output current

put pulse being less than 10-3; (2) the duration time of the
stabilized  flat  top  should be  greater  than  1  msec;  (3)  the
maximum current is 1000 A; (4) the rise time for the current
pulse is 5 msec. A typical measured pattern of  the output
current from the supply with a dummy coil is shown in Fig-
ure 4. This shows that the stability of the current is about
5x10-4. The other requirements have also been achieved.

5. BREAKDOWN TEST OF THE COPPER

ELECTRODE

  An electrical breakdown test has been conducted to deter-
mine the electrical characteristics of the electroformed cop-
per by the PR process for the DTL [4,5]. Electrodes made
by  other  processes  were  also  tested,  in order  to  compare
their properties. The top of the electrode is hemispheric in
shape, with a radius of 30mm.
  The results show that the first breakdown field for the elec-
trode made by the PR copper electroforming is significantly
higher than those of the other electrodes, except for an elec-
trode made of OFC finished by a diamond bite. Table 2 shows
typical results for the first breakdown field level. The data

indicates  that the  surface of  the  electroformed copper  by
PR  process has the most suitable properties for the accel-
erator cavity.

6. HIGH-POWER TEST OF A MODEL

TANK

  A short tank (1.4 m in length) has been made for a high-
power  test of the DTL components ( the rf contactors for
the stems and the end plates, the electroformed copper sur-
face, a drift tube with the quadrupole magnet, tuners, and
the input coupler). A schematic representation of the tank is
shown  in  Figure  5.  Only  the  shortest  drift  tube  has  a
quadrupole magnet inside. The tank consists of the first three
cells and the last four cells of the DTL. The right half of the
3rd drift tube is half of the 142nd drift tube. Thus, the posi-
tion of the stem of the tube is not ideal, as the stem is lo-
cated at center of the tube. As this is likely to lead to non-
uniformity in the accelerating field (Ez) distribution, which
is measured by  a bead  perturbation method, the  non-uni-
formity around the  3rd drift tube, that can  be seen  in the
data shown in Figure 5, is as expected. The measured un-
loaded Q-value was 46200, which is about 93 % of the esti-
mated value, and includes the effect of all components. The
shunt impedance is 54.7 MW
/m. Because the design value
of the Ez is 2.5 MV/m, the required input rf-power is about

  The first high-power conditioning was carried out at the
end of April this year. Figure 7 shows the conditioning his-
tory of the tank. The design value for the peak power was
easily  achieved  with  the  short-pulse  (several  10  µsec  in
duration) operation, requiring just two days to achieve full-
power operation. The high-power test was terminated when
a ceramic window of the input coupler broke; however, when
the end plate of the tank was opened to check the inside, no
trace of the discharge was observed on the inner surface of
the tank ,the surface of the drift tube, or on the rf contactor
for the end plate.

7. CONCLUSION

  The construction of the Alvaretz DTL for the JAERI/KEK
joint project has been started. The components developed
for the DTL  have been tested  in a  high-power test of  the
DTL model. In particular, the PR electroformed copper was
found  to  have  excellent  properties.   There  are    problems
with the input coupler that need to be solved. However, mass
production of the magnet and drift tube is already in progress,
and the production of the pulsed-power supplies for the first
DTL tank is completed.

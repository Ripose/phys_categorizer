Abstract  –    The  spectrum  of  the  Dirac  oscillator    perturbed  by  the  Coulomb  potential  is  considered.  The  Regge 
trajectories  for  its  bound  states  are  obtained  with  the  method  of  ħ-expansion.    It  is  shown  that  the  split  of  the 
degenerate energy levels of the Dirac oscillator in the Coulomb field is approximately linear in the coupling constant.

The  current  interest  in  the  Dirac  oscillator  is  motivated  by  its  possible  applications  in  nuclear  and  hadron 
physics  (see  [1]  and  references  therein).  This  model  is  a  version  of  harmonic  oscillator  for  relativistic  spin  ½ 
particles. It has the exact solution and the degenerate spectrum of eigenenergies 
[2].
However, the unphysical degeneracy of the spectrum is removed in the perturbative external field. The goal of 
the  present  work  is  to  consider  the  split  of  the  degenerate  energy  levels  of  the  Dirac  oscillator  caused  by  the 
external Coulomb field.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. THE METHOD

In  the  Dirac  equation,  we  arrive  at  the  Dirac  oscillator  with  the  non-minimal  substitution

where    is  the  oscillator  frequency  and     is  the  usual  Dirac  matrix.  Then  the  model  of  the  Dirac  oscillator 
perturbed by the Coulomb potential 

is described by the equation  (in units with

In order to solve the bound state problem defined by equations (2), we extend the method of the ħ-expansion 

for the Regge trajectories [4],[5] to the case of the Dirac oscillator interaction.

Let  us  recall  that  within  the  framework  of  the  non-relativistic  quantum  mechanics,  the  Regge  trajectory  is 
defined as the dependence of the orbital quantum number on the energy,
, at the fixed value of the 
radial quantum number  n . For the Dirac equation, the role of the Regge trajectory plays the invariant quantity

Following  the  work  [5],  we  transform  equations  (2)  into  the  non-linear  Riccati  equation  with  respect  to  the 
  that  permits  us  to  derive  the  recursion  relations. We  seek  the 

logarithmic  derivative 
solution of the Riccati equation as the series expansions in powers of the Planck’s constant 

Because  the  wave  function  of  the  n -th  radially  excited  state  has  exactly  n   nodes  on  the  real  axis  its 

logarithmic derivative should satisfy the quantization condition

where the contour of the integration encloses only the above mentioned nodes.

This condition must be supplemented with a rule of passing to the classical limit for the radial ( n ) and orbital 

( l ) quantum numbers which are the specific quantum notions. We use the following rule

From  the  physical  point  of  view,  the  rule  (5)  means  that  in  the  classical  limit  the  particle  is  located  in  the 
bottom  of  the  effective  potential  and,  consequently,  moves  along  the  stable  circular  orbit.  Then  the  classical 
orbital momentum of the particle, which is the first approximation to its Regge trajectory, takes the form

For convenience of consideration, let us introduce the new variable 

that is the deviation from 
the  minimum  of  the  effective  potential.  According  to  the  general  scheme  of  the  ħ-expansion  method  [4],[5],

From  Fig.  1  we  see  that  the  Regge  trajectories  are  approximately  linear  in  the  squared  energy.  It  will  be 

recalled that the exact linearity is realized when the Coulomb interaction is turned off.

We  have  considered  the  bound-state  problem  for  the  Dirac  oscillator  perturbed  by  the  Lorentz-vector
Coulomb  potential.  To  derive  the  Regge  trajectories  of  the  bound  states  of  this  system,  the  semiclassical 
technique of the asymptotical ħ-expansions has been applied.

The dependence of the energy spectrum on the Coulomb coupling constant has been studied. It has been found 
that magnitudes of the splits of energy levels are nearly linear in the Coulomb coupling constant. For the case of 
the Lorentz-scalar Coulomb potential, the similar behaviour of the Regge trajectories has been observed.

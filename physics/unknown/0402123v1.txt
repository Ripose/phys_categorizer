Off-diagonal impedance in amorphous wires and application

to linear magnetic sensors

Abstract  -   The  magnetic-field  behaviour  of  the  off-diagonal  impedance  in  Co-based

amorphous wires is investigated under the condition of sinusoidal (50 MHz) and pulsed

(5  ns  rising  time)  current  excitations.  For  comparison,  the  field  characteristics  of  the

diagonal  impedance  are  measured  as  well.  In  general,  when  an  alternating  current  is

applied  to  a  magnetic  wire  the  voltage  signal  is  generated  not  only  across  the  wire  but

also  in  the  coil  mounted  on  it.  These  voltages  are  related  with  the  diagonal  and  off-

diagonal  impedances,  respectively.  It  is  demonstrated  that  these  impedances  have  a

different behaviour as a function of axial magnetic field: the former is symmetrical and

the latter is antisymmetrical with a near linear portion within a certain field interval. In

the case of the off-diagonal response, the dc bias current eliminating circular domains is

necessary. The pulsed excitation that combines both high and low frequency harmonics

produces the off-diagonal voltage response without additional bias current or field. This

suits  ideal  for  a  practical  sensor  circuit  design.  The  principles  of  operation  of  a  linear

magnetic sensor based on C-MOS transistor circuit are discussed.

I. Introduction

Magneto-impedance  (MI)  is  an  expanding  area  of  current  research  because  of  its

importance  for  micro  magnetic  sensor  applications  [1-6].  Recently  developed  MI  sensor

technology  uses  CoFeSiB  amorphous  wires  as  MI-element  incorporated  into  C-MOS  IC

multivibrator pulse current circuit. Typical parameters of sensor operation with 1 mm long MI

head are: a field resolution of 10-6 Oe (0.1 nT) for the full scale of – 1 Oe (0.1 mT), a response

speed of 1 MHz, and a power consumption of about 10 mW. The sensor sensitivity is at least

an order of magnitude higher than that for GMR sensors. These advanced characteristics are

associated with a large change in the range of 100% in high-frequency impedance of Co-based

amorphous  wires  subjected  to  a  moderate  magnetic  field  (1-5  Oe).  Sensor  operation  needs

high sensitivity combined with linearity. On the other hand, the impedance vs. field behaviour

in  amorphous  wires  is  essentially  non-linear  especially  near  zero-field  point.  Customarily,

applying a dc bias field or utilising an asymmetric MI effect [7-9] achieves linearity. On the

other  hand,  off-diagonal  impedance  may  have  almost  linear  region  near  zero-field  point

[10,11] and hence can be used for linear sensing, as demonstrated in this paper.

Generally, impedance  wZ  in a wire is understood as a ratio of voltage  wV   measured

across it to a passing ac current  i  (see Fig. 1(a)). In wires with a circumferential anisotropy

this quantity is very sensitive to a dc axial magnetic field 

exH , as a result of the skin effect

and ac transverse magnetisation. The real and imaginary parts of the function 

w HZ
(

 are

symmetrical having either a peak at a zero field or two identical peaks at 

H

, where

KH  is the characteristic anisotropy field. For a helical static magnetisation, the ac current  i

induces also  a voltage  cV   in  the  coil  mounted  on  the  wire  (see  Fig.  1(a)),  since  the  current

flow gives rise to ac axial magnetisation. The ratio

impedance.  In  contrast,  if  the  wire  is  placed  in  an  ac  longitudinal  magnetic  field

induced by the coil current  ci  ( n  is the number of coil turns per unit length), the circulatory

ac magnetisation contributes to  wV  (see Fig. 1(b)). The ratio

 also may be called

the off-diagonal impedance.  The crossed magnetisation processes that are responsible for the

voltages  wV  and  cV  are known as the inverse Wiedemann and Matteucci effects [3,10,11]. In

single-domain  wires  with  a  circumferential  anisotropy,  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the

functions 

c HZ
(

ex

)

 and 

~
w HZ
(

ex

)

 are  antisymmetrical with a near-linear region around zero

field  point  [10,11].  These  off-diagonal  field  characteristics  can  be  used  in  linear  sensing.  A

practical  design  of  such  a  sensor  is  reported  in  [12]  where  the  wire  element  is  exited  by  a

pulse current of C-MOS IC multivibrator and the output signal is measured in a wire coil (the

off-diagonal  component 

c HZ
(

ex

)

).  Therefore,  the  sensor  operation  is  based  on  the  off-

diagonal impedance. This has not been made clear and no analysis of the related impedance

components as functions of the sensed field has been carried out.

In  this  paper,  we  investigate  the  field  behaviour  of  the  off-diagonal  impedance

c HZ
(

ex

)

  in  CoFeSiB  glass  covered  amorphous  wires  by  means  of  two  types  of

measurements.  The  wire  is  excited  with  a  sinusoidal  current  using  a  HP  8753e  Network

Analyser, and  with  a  pulse current using C-MOS  multivibrator  circuit.  We  demonstrate  that

for a multidomain state in a wire, the off-diagonal impedance is almost  zero for any value of

exH . Biasing the ac current with a dc one which  saturates the outer shell of the wire in the

circular  direction  is  essential  to  get  the  off-diagonal  properties  in  the  case  of  the

circumferential anisotropy. The discussion is made using the concept of the surface impedance

tensor and generalised Ohm’s law. In the case of the pulse current excitation, which contains

both low and high frequency harmonics the off-diagonal impedance is large without applying

any additional dc bias. A practical sensor design is analysed as well.

 flowing in a wire with a helical magnetisation induces voltages  wV

across the wire and  cV  in the coil mounted on the wire, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The voltage  cV

appears as a result of the change in the ac axial magnetisation 

zm  caused by the circular field

jh   produced  by  the  current  i   (at  the  wire  surface

In general, the voltage response in a magnetic wire

 is related to the current

 via the surface impedance tensor  ˆV

 [10]. This is convenient since the tensor  ˆV

represents  the  relationship  between  the  electric  field  (which  determines  the  voltage)  and

magnetic  field  (which  determines  the  current)  on  the  wire  surface.  The  following  equations

efm   is  the  ac  effective

circumferential  permeability  with  respect  to  the  ac  current  flow  [10].  Observing  Eq.  (4)  the

important  conclusion  can  be  made.  The  impedance  tensor  components  have  a  different

symmetry with respect to the dc magnetisation: the diagonal components 

zzZ  and  jjZ

 do not

change  when  the  direction  of  the  equilibrium  dc  magnetisation 

0M   is  reversed  whereas  the

off-diagonal  components 

jzZ

  and 

zZj   change  the  sign  together  with 

0M .  Therefore,  the

off-diagonal  impedances  are  antisymmetrical  with  respect  to 

0M .  In  fact,  the  permeability

parameter  also  depends  on  the  magnetisation  angle  q   but  this  does  not  alter  the  conclusion

made.

In a wire with a circumferential anisotropy, the axial magnetic field is a hard axis field

that will produce a linear magnetisation curve in the range of

such  magnetic  configuration.  Some  deviation  from  linearity  may  be  due  to  the  field

dependence  of  the  permeability  parameter 

efm .  However,  if  the  wire  has  a  circular  domain

structure  the  off-diagonal  components  averaged  over  domains  are  zeroed,  because  of  the

factor 

qsin , which has opposite signs in the domains with the opposite circular magnetisation.

It  implies  that  a  dc  bias  current  will  be  needed  to  eliminate  circular  domain  structure.  A

typical  field  behaviour  of  the  off-diagonal  impedance  is  demonstrated  in  Fig.  2  where  the

result of calculations for a single domain wire with a circumferential anisotropy is given [10].

III. Impedance investigation

In  this  Section  we  consider  the  impedance  characteristics  under  sinusoidal  current

excitation. Glass covered Co64.6Fe3.5Si15.5B16.4 amorphous wires produced by Taylor-Ulitovsky

method (kindly provided by MFTI Ltd, Moldova) have been used as an MI element in all the

experiments. The wire has a metallic amorphous core of 29.6 m m in diameter ( wd ) covered by

glass with thickness of 2.3 m m, as sketched in Fig. 3. The equilibrium magnetisation is mainly

determined by the negative  magnetostriction coupled with the axial stress, which results in a

circumferential anisotropy and a circular domain structure. This structure is confirmed by dc

longitudinal magnetisation measurements, which show almost a non-hysteretic linear curve, as

seen in Fig. 4. The anisotropy field is estimated to be about 1.4 Oe.

A  HP  8753e  Network  Analyser  with  a  specially  designed  high  frequency  measuring

cells (seen in Figs. 5(a),(b)) is used for the impedance measurements. The cells have 3.5-mm

connectors and are linked up to the Transmitter/Receiver ports. A wire element (8 mm long)

soldered  or  bonded  to  the  cell  is  excited  by  the  sinusoidal  input  voltage 

inV .  The  output

voltage  outV

 is taken from the wire (Fig. 5(a)) or from a tiny coil (Fig. 5(b)), which has 25

turns and a diameter of 120 m m. Blocking capacitor (C) prevents the dc bias current  bI  from

6

entering the Analyser. Terminal resistors are required for normalising input/output impedance

of  the  measured  elements.  The 

21S -parameter  (forward  transmission)  is  measured  as  a

function of a sensed magnetic field 

exH  applied in the wire axial direction. In general, a dc

bias current  bI   can  be  applied  to  the  wire.  By  frequency  scanning  we  have  chosen  optimal

frequency of 50 MHz for our simples, when the impedance characteristics are most sensitive

to 

exH . The impedance components 

zzZ  and 

zZj  (

jzZ”

) are determined by measuring the

output signal  outV

 from the wire (

=
out V
V

w

) or from the coil (

=
out V
V

c

), respectively. In both

cases the ac current  i  supplied by 

inV  is applied to the wire. The  21S -parameter is defined as

dimensionless quantity 

S

. Then, putting 

0=

 in Eq. (3), both 

zzZ  and 

zZj  are

calculated as the ratio

Figure 6 shows the longitudinal impedance 

zzZ  versus applied magnetic field 

exH  at

the  fixed  frequency  50  MHz.  As  it  could  be  expected  from  Eq.  (4),  both  the  real  and

imaginary parts are symmetrical with respect to 

exH , exhibiting two maximums at the field in

the

 is shown in Fig. 7 at the fixed frequency of 50 MHz for different bias

currents.  In  this  case,  if  no  dc  bias  current  is  used,  the  response  signal  is  very  small  and

irregular. It increases substantially when a small dc current 

 mA is applied. Typically,

5.2=

bI

the coercivity in amorphous wires is about a fraction of Oe and applying a small current of few

mA eliminates circular domains. Therefore,  in  the  case  of  a  circumferential  anisotropy  and  a

circular domain structure, the presence of  bI   is  the  necessary  condition  for  the  existence  of

the off-diagonal components of the impedance tensor. The real and imaginary parts of the off-

diagonal  component  are  antisymmetrical  with  respect  to  the  field 

exH ,  having  almost  linear

behaviour in the field range of  2–

 Oe.

IV. C-MOS sensor -  pulse excitation of MI wires

In  this  Section  we  consider  a  pulse  excitation  of  the  wire  samples  using  C-MOS

transistor  circuits,  shown  in  Fig.  8.  This  corresponds  to  a  practical  MI  sensor  circuit

design.[12] As in Section III, the output signal is taken from the wire or from the coil. The real

and  imaginary  parts  of  the  impedance  components  measured  by  the  Analyser  correspond  to

the  signal  amplitude  and  its  phase  (time  shifting  with  respect  to  the  excitation  signal)  in  a

physical  device.  The  amplitude  includes  the  signal  value  and  its  sign.  We  will  be  interested

only in the amplitude with sign since the phase is not important for the field dependence of the

output voltage.

The circuit operates as follows. Square-wave generator (Q1, Q2) produces rectangular

signal  as  shown  in  Fig.  9  (bottom  signal).  Differential  circuit  (C3,  R3)  transfers  the  squire-

wave  signal  into  the  positive  pulses,  which  are  applied  to  the  wire  (Fig.  9,  top  signal).

Analysing the MI characteristics obtained under a sinusoidal excitation the optimal frequency

of 50 MHz has been identified, for which the maximal sensitivity (and the best linearity in the

case of the off-diagonal impedance) has been achieved. In the case of a pulsed excitation, such

parameters  as  a  rise  time  and  a  fall  time  determine  the  frequency  of  the  principle  harmonic.

The time parameter of 5ns corresponds to the optimal frequency of 50 MHz. The rise and fall

times of the pulse signal are determined by the construction of HEX Inverters. The 74HCT04

inverter  possesses  the  needed  characteristics.  Further  more,  this  microchip  has  a  minimal

distortion and high temperature stability.

To demonstrate the principles of the MI sensor operation, the output pulse voltages are

obtained for different sensed field 

exH . The voltage signal taken across the wire (using cell of

Fig.  5(a))  corresponds  to  the  diagonal  impedance 

zzZ .  Figures  10(a),(b)  show  the  diagonal

voltage  response  ( wV )  before  the  rectifier  (SW1,  R4,  C4)  for 

exH

0=

  and 

exH

6.2=

  Oe,

respectively. The amplitude of the main pulse is increased almost twice in the presence of the

8

field.  If  the  field  is  applied  in  the  reversed  direction,  the  pulse  amplitude  and  sign  do  not

change.  This  is  in  line  with  the  result  obtained  for  a  sinusoidal  excitation:  the  real  and

imaginary  parts  of  the  diagonal  impedance  are  symmetrical  with  respect  to  the  axial  sensed

field.  In  the  case  of  the  output  taken  from  the  coil  (off-diagonal  response 

cV ),  the  signal  is

very small if no axial magnetic field is applied. In the presence of the field, the voltage pulse

increases  and  when  the  field  is  reversed  the  direction  of  the  pulse  is  reversed  as  well.  This

behaviour is demonstrated in Fig. 11, where the top signal is the excitation pulse on the wire

and the bottom signal is the output voltage before the rectifier (SW1, R4, C4) as a function of

the  sensing  field 

exH .  Therefore,  in  the  case  of  a  pulse  excitation,  the  off-diagonal  voltage

response  shows  antisymmetrical  field  characteristics,  similar  to  that  for  the  off-diagonal

impedance. Note that the pulse excitation does not require the use of the dc bias current  bI  to

make  the  off-diagonal  voltage  be  induced  since  such  excitation  already  involves  low-

frequency harmonics.

The  rest  of  the  circuit  is  needed  to  obtain  a  rectified  output  depending  on  the  field

exH .  Digital  switch  (SW1)  filters  away  a  background  noise  signal  along  with  an  unwanted

pulse voltage portion.  Its output impedance is loaded by 50 ?. The integrating  element (R4,

C4) produces a smooth quasi-dc signal in proportion to the pulse amplitude (with sign). The

parameters are chosen such that the integrating time is much larger than the pulse train period.

The circuit does not contain a detector (diode) because we would like to measure the signal

amplitude along with its sign. Figure 12 shows the integrated diagonal ( wV ) and off-diagonal

( cV ) responses after the rectification and amplification as a function of 

exH . In the case of the

diagonal  response  (Fig.  12(a)),  the  field  characteristics  are  symmetrical  showing  two

maximums  at 

exH

4–=

  Oe.  This  behaviour  is  very  similar  to  that  shown  in  Fig.  6  for  the

diagonal  impedance.  The  off-diagonal  voltage  output  as  a  function  of 

exH   shown  in  Fig.

9

12(b) has  almost  linear  portion  in  the  field  interval

  Oe.  This  is  similar  to  the  off-

exH

2–=

diagonal  impedance  versus 

exH   shown  in  Fig.  7.  Therefore,  we  can  conclude  that  the  off-

diagonal  voltage  response  in  amorphous  wires  with  a  circumferential  anisotropy  obtained

under pulsed excitation can be linear with respect to the sensed axial field without using any

bias  fields  or  currents.  In  fact,  the  pulse  current  applied  to  the  wire  itself  does  two  jobs:  it

causes  a  high  frequency  magnetisation  that  is  responsible  for  the  voltage-field  dependence,

and it also partially eliminates circular domains making the off-diagonal response possible.

V. Conclusion

The  principles  of  operation  of  a  linear  magnetic  sensor  circuit  based  on  magneto-

impedance  (MI)  in  glass-covered  Co-based  amorphous  wires  have  been  revealed  by

considering  sinusoidal  and  pulsed  current  excitations.  In  the  first  case,  the  voltage  response

detected  across  the  wire  and  in  the  coil  mounted  on  it  directly  proportional  to  the  complex

impedance  (diagonal  or  off-diagonal,  respectively).  It  was  shown  that  the  off-diagonal

response is realised under the application of a dc bias current. The diagonal and off-diagonal

impedances  have  different  field  behaviour:  the  former  is  symmetric  and  the  latter  is

antisymmetric  within  respect  to  the  axial  sensed  field.  This  property  is  very  important  for

linear  magnetic  sensing.  A  practical  C-MOS  transistor  circuit  producing  pulsed  current

excitation of the wire is analysed. In this case, the pulse current contains both low and high

frequency  harmonics  and  can  induce  the  off-diagonal  response  without  additional  dc  bias.

This configuration is especially advantageous to realise sensitive linear sensing.

Fig.  7.  Real  in  (a)  and  imaginary  in  (b)  parts  of  the  field  dependence  of  the  off-diagonal

response  for 

50=f

  MHz.  Without  bias  current  bI ,  the  off-diagonal  response  is  very  poor

and irregular due to the averaging over the stripe domain structure. With 

5.2=

bI

 mA the off-

diagonal  response 

increases  significantly  and  becomes  antisymmetric,  as  predicted

theoretically.

Fig. 8. Principle  electronic  circuit  for  a  sensor  with  a  pulse  excitation,  which  can  utilise  the

off-diagonal  impedance.  The  circuit  includes:  C-MOS  IC  multivibrator  with  invertors  (Q1,

Q2), differential circuit (C3, R3), analogous synchronised switch (SW1), integrator (R4, C4),

and differential amplifier. The ac signal is taken from the wire ( wV ) or pick-up coil ( cV ) using

the analogous synchronised switch (SW1) and converted to a dc voltage by the integrator (R4,

C4).

Fig.  9.  Rectangular  signal  produced  by  the  square-wave  generator  (Q1,  Q2)  (bottom  signal)

and  the  positive  pulses  after  the  differential  circuit  (C3,  R3)  (top  signal).  The  sharp  pulse

excitation containing the high frequency harmonics and dc bias (zero  harmonic) is applied to

the wire. Vertical resolution: 2V/dev, horizontal resolution: 50 ns/dev.

The amplitude of the main pulse is increased almost twice in the presence of the field. If the

field is applied in the reversed direction, the pulse amplitude and sign do not change.

Fig. 11. Off-diagonal response  cV  before the rectifier (SW1, R4, C4) measured from the pick-

up coil. Horizontal resolution: 50ns/dev. Vertical resolution: 2V/dev for the top signal and 50

mV/dev for the bottom signal. The top signal in (a), (b) and (c) is the excitation pulse at the

wire. The bottom signal in (a), (b) and (c) is the off-diagonal response from the pick-up coil.

cV  is very small if no axial magnetic field 

exH  is applied (see (a)). In the presence of 

exH ,

the voltage pulse increases (see (b), and (c)) and when the field is reversed the direction of the

pulse is reversed as well (see (c)). Therefore, in the case of a pulse excitation, the off-diagonal

voltage  response  shows  antisymmetrical  field  characteristics,  similar  to  that  for  the  off-

diagonal impedance.

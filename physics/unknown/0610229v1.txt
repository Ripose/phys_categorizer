Abstract.  The  reflection  and  transmission  of  a  few-cycle  femtosecond  Ti:Sa  laser  pulse 
impinging on a metal nano-layer have been analysed. The thickness of  the layer was assumed 
to be of the order of 2-10 nm, and the metallic free electrons were represented by a surface 
current density at the plane boundary of a dielectric substrate. The target studied this way can 
be  imagined  for  instance  as  a  semi-transparent  mirror  produced  by  evaporating  a  thin 
aluminum layer on the surface of a glas plate. The exact analytical solution has been given for 
the system of the coupled Maxwell-Lorentz equations describing the dynamics of the surface 
current  and  the  scattered  radiation  field.  It  has  been  shown  that  in  general  a  non-oscillatory 
frozen-in wake-field appears following the main pulse with an exponential decay and with a 
definite  sign  of  the  electric  field.  The  characteristic  time  of  these  wake-fields  is  inversely 
proportional  with  the  square  of  the  plasma  frequency    and  with  the  thickness  of  the  metal 
nano-layer,  and  can  larger  then  the  original  pulse  duration.  The  magnitude  of  these  wake-
fields  is  proportional  with  the  incoming  field  strength,  and  the  definite  sign  of  them  is 
governed  by  the  cosine  of  the  carrier-envelope  phase  difference  of  the  incoming  ultrashort 
laser  pulse.  As  a  consequence,  when  we  let  such  a  wake-field  excite  the  electrons  of  a 
secondary  target  (say  an  electron  beam,  a  metal  plate  or  a  gas  jet),  we  obtain  100  percent 
modulation depth in the electron signal in a given direction. This scheeme can perhaps serve 
as a basis for the construction of a robust linear carrier-envelope phase difference meter.

1. Introduction 

The study of the interaction of intense few-cycle laser pulses with matter has brought a 
new,  important  branch  of  investigations  in  nonlinear  optics,  as  Brabec  and  Krausz  [1] 
emphasized in their review paper. The effect of the absolute phase (the carrier-envelope phase 
difference,  in  short:  CE  phase)  on  the  nonlinear  response  of  atoms  and  of  solids  interacting 
with a very short, few-cycle strong laser pulse has recently drawn considerable attention and 
has initiated a wide-spreading theoretical and experimental research. For instance Paulus et al. 
[2] have detected an anticorrelation in the shot-to-shot analysis of the photoelectron yield of 
ionization measured by two opposing detectors. This effect comes from the random variation 
of the CE phase (hence the direction and the magnitude of the electric field of the laser) from 
one  pulse  to  the  other.  Such  extreme  short  pulses  can  be  used  to  monitor  the  details  of 
photoelectron  dynamics  [3]  or  atomic  inner-shell  relaxation  processes,  like  the  Auger  effect 
[4]. Concerning theory, the CE pase-dependence of the spatial asymmetry in photoionization 
has been extensively investigated by Chelkowski et al. [5], and by Milosevic et al. [6-7]. In

the  meantime  the  problem  of  the  stabilization  of  the  CE  phase  in  the  few-cycle  laser  pulse 
trains has been achieved [8-9]. On the basis of a simulation, using the time-dependent density 
functional  approach,  Lemell  et  al.  [10]  predicted  the  CE  phase-dependence  of  the 
photoelectron yield in case of the surface photoelectric effect of metals in the tunnel regime. 
Apolonskiy et al. [11] and Dombi et. al. [12] have reported the measurement of this effect, but 
the  absolut  phase-dependence  had  a  considerably  smaller  modulation  (CE  phase-sensitivity) 
in their experiment than predicted by the simulation. Fortier et al. has recently demonstrated 
the CE phase effect in quantum interference of injected photocurrents in semiconductors [13]. 
In  the  multiphoton  regime  Nakajima  and  Watanabe  [14]  has  found  theoretically  CE  phase 
effects in the bound state population of a Cs atom excited by nearly single-cycle pulses.  

At  this  point  we  would  like  to  note  that  there  is  a  wide-spread  opinion  among 
researchers  investigating  the  CE  phase  effects  that  these  effects  appear  exclusively  in 
nonlinear processes. In fact, as Fearn and Lamb [15] have shown already in 1991, the sine or 
the  cosine  character  of  the  laser  pulse  make  a  difference  in  the  linear  photoionization 
dynamics if one takes into account the counter-rotating term in the interaction. As they wrote 
in  Section  IV.  of  their  paper:  “This  suggests  that…the  time  delay  [of  the  electron  signal] 
could be used to measure the phase of the field.” A simple illustration of the linear CE phase 
effect has recently been considered by Ristow [16] in the case of a harmonic oscillator. 

We  have  seen  above,  that  in  the  theoretical  works  exclusively  nonlinear  quantum 
processes (photoionization, surface photoelectric effect) have been considered. In the present 
paper we briefly describe our theoretical analysis on the reflection and transmission of a few-
cycle laser pulse on a thin metal layer represented by a surface current. Our analysis here, as 
in our earlier study [17], is based completely on classical electrodynamics and mechanics, in 
the  frame  of  which  we  solve  the  system  of  coupled  Maxwell-Lorentz  equations  of  the 
incoming  and  scattered  radiation  and  the  classical  surface  current  representing  the  metallic 
electrons.  

In  Section  2  we  present  the  basic  equations  describing  our  model,  and  present  the 
exact  analytical  solution  of  the  scattering  problem  in  the  non-relativistic  regime.  Here  we 
shall briefly analyse the exact solutions in the frequency domain. In Section 3 we discusse the 
temporal behaviour of the reflected (and transmitted) signal, and we shall show that a “pulse-
decompression”  and  “freezing-in”  of  the  radiation  field  may  happen,  yielding  to  the 
appearance of a quasi-static wake-field in the scattered signal.

The  model  to  be  used  here  we  have  already  studied  in  our  earlier  work  [17].  For 
completeness  of  the  present  paper,  let  us  briefly  summarize  first  the  basic  notations  and 
equations, which can also be found in Ref. [17]. We take the coordinate system such that the 
first dielectric with index of refraction  1n  fills the region 
, this  is called region 1. In 
region 2 we place the thin metal layer of thickness  2l
 perpendicular to the z-axis and defined

dielectric having the index of refraction 
 is assumed to be much smaller 
then  the  average  skin  depth  of  the  incoming  radiation.  The  target  defined  this  way  can  be 
imagined as a thin metal layer evaporated, for instance, on a glass substrate. This layer, in fact 
is assumed to be represented by a sheet of electrons bound to region 2 and moving freely in 
the x-y  plane. In  case of perpendicular  incidence  the  light  would  come  from  the positive z-
direction, and it would be transmitted in the negative z-direction into region 3. The plane of 
incidence is defined as the y-z plane and the initial  kr -vector is assumed to make an angle  1θ

damping  parameter  Γb   where  Γ   has  been  defined  in  Eq.  (10).  This  latter  constant  is 
proportional with the squared plasma frequency and the thickness of the electron layer. The 
appearance of the damping term is a manifestation of the radiation reaction coming formally 
from  the  boudary  conditions  in  the  present  description.  Since  Γ   is  proportional  with  the 
electron density, this effect is due to the collective response of the electrons to the action of 
the complete (not only the incoming) radiation field, which, on the other had reacts back to 
the  electrons.  In  the  present  description  it  is  not  possible  to  divide  into  steps  these

From Eq. (20b) it is immediately seen that for any linear excitation process (whose response 
function  is  proportional  with  the  incoming  intensity)  the  frequency  dependence  of  the 
modulation function (“visibility” or “contrast function”) of the response function is given by 
the expression

phase. This means that as we vary the CE phase between 0 and  π, the modulation depth is 
given by Eq. (21). It is clear that if  τω0  is very large (which is the case of many-cycle pulses), 
then  the  modulation  function  is  practically  zero.  On  the  other  hand,  when  τω0   is  not  large 
(which is the case of few-cycle pulses), then for small frequencies (
) we can have a 
modulation close to 100%. From Eqs. (15), (16) and (21) one obtains that the modulation of 
both  the  reflected  and  the  transmitted  signal  is  given  by 
  at  a  particular 
frequency.  On  the  other  hand  neither  of  the  reflection  coefficient  nor  the  transmission 
coefficient  depend  on  the  CE  phase  in  the  linear  regime.  It  is  clear  that  if  the  response 
function contains a resonance at a small frequency (
), then there is a better chance to 
observe the mentioned linear CE-phase-dependence at that particular resonance frequency.

At  this  point  let  us  note  that  Eqs.  (15)  and  (16)  are  more  general  then  the  original 
relations, Eqs. (11), (12) and (13), written in the time domain, where the indeces of refractions 
1n   and 
3n   have  been  taken  as  mere  constants.  The  optional  dispersion  can  be  taken  into 
account in Eqs. (15) and (16) by putting by hand a frequency dependence into  1n  and 
3n . In 
the  present  paper  we  are  not  dealing  with  this  aspect  of  the  problem.  Our  description  is 
approximate  to  the  real  scattering  process  in  an  other  respect,  too,  namely  it  relies  on  the 
plane-wave  model  of  the  incoming,  reflected  and  the  refracted  field.  This  is  a  standard 
approximation  which  is  used  in  the  texbooks  throughout.  Equations  (15)  and  (16)  can  be 
superimposed  for  an  assembly  of  incoming  plane  waves  of  different  propagation  direction, 

S. Varró: Reflection of a few-cycle laser pulse…

and  this  description  would  be  suitable  to  handle  the  scattering  of  a  beam  with  a  limited 
transverse extension. In the present paper we are not dealing with this aspect of the scattering 
problem, either. Thus, our results are suitable to describe the scattering of unfocused beams. 

 

 
3. The appearance of frozen-in wake-fields in the scattered signal 

As  one  sees  from  Eqs.  (15)  and  (16)  both  the  reflected  and  the  refracted  Fourier 
components  have  a  pole  at 
,  which  means  that    in  the  time  domain  a  functional 
dependence of the form 
, where  b  and κ 
were defined in Eqs. (13a) and (17), respectively, and 
 is the central period of the 
incoming  field.  This  can  easily  be  shown  by  integrating  the  ordinary  first  order  differential 
equation Eq. (13) for the local velocity
, which determines through Eq. (11) and (12) the

The integral in Eq. (22) can be easily evaluated for any usual functional form of the incoming

For  a  model  pulse  of  a  sin2  envelope  of  finite  support  (which  has  been  widely  used  in 
numerical  simulations),  the  integral  can  be  calculated  analytically.  Henceforth,  in  our 
illustrative numerical examples we will use the Gaussian pulse defined in Eq. (19).

Before  entering  into  some  numerical  examples  of  the  temporal  behaviour  of  the 
scattered field, let us make some general remarks. It is clear that if the pulse duration of the

incoming  field 
exponential  factor,  then 
  cuts  off  a  small  region  in  the  inegration  interval  in  Eq.  (22) 
because  of  the  relative  smoothness  of  the  exponential  function.  This  means  that  the  upper 
limit of the integral can be extended up to infinity within a reasonable approximation. Hence 
  can  certainly  be  well  represented  by  the

In the numerical expressions in Eq. (24d)  I  denotes the mean intensity of the pulse measured 
in W/cm2, 
phE  is the mean photon energy in eV-s, and  λ denotes the central wavelength of 
the  pulse  measured  in  microns  (we  have  not  displayed  the  numerical  prefactors  of  order 
unity).  According  to  Eq.  (24c),  the  polarization  current  and  (due  to  Eq.  (11))  the  scattered 
field  itself  contains  a  wake-field  which  is  a  frozen-in  non-oscillatory  quasi-static  field 
 after leaving the metal layer. The decay time

of this wake-field is given by 
, which can be much larger than an optical period, as is 
κπb
shown  on  Fig.  1,  where  we  have  taken 
.  Since  we  are  dealing  just  with  few-cycle 
incoming  pulses,  this  means,  that  the  wake-field  is  still  present,  after  the  main  pulse  has 
passed.  Moreover,  from  Eq.  (23a)  it  can  be  seen,  that  at  the  Brewster  angle  of  incidence 
)  only  the  wake-field  is  propagating  in  that  particular 
(
c

direction. It is remarkable, that, as can be seen from Eqs. (24b-c),  the amplitude of the wake-
field is proportional with the cosine of the CE phase ϕ. Thus, for instance, by varying the CE 
phase,  the  sign  of  the  quasi-static  wake-field  can  be  reversed.  On  Fig.  2  an  illustrative 
example  is  shown  for  the  temporal  behavior  of  the  reflected  signal  at  Brewster  angle  of 
incidence of an incoming one-cycle Ti:Sa laser pulse.

Thus, for an incoming laser of intensity 
, the amplitude of the frozen-in wake-
field in the reflected signal is of oder of 50000 V/cm, which is quite a large value for a quasi-
static  field.  As  we  have  already  mentioned  above  the  amplitude  and  sign  of  this  wake-field 
can be varied by changing the CE phase of the incoming pulse. The idea naturally emerges, 
that  when  we  let  such  a  wake-field  excite  the  electrons  of  a  secondary  target    –    say  an 
electron beam, a second metal plate or a gas jet  –  we may obtain 100 percent modulation 
depth in the electron signal (acceleration, tunnel-ionization) in a given direction, even for a 
relatively  low  intensity  incoming  field.  This  scheeme  can  perhaps  serve  as  a  basis  for  the 
construction  of  a  robust  linear  carrier-envelope  phase  difference  meter.  At  the  end  of  the 
present section we would like to emphasize that the generation of the wake-fields discussed 
above is a linear process, since the amplitude of the wake-field is simply proportional with the 
amplitude of the incoming field. This means that for the observation of the effect considered 
here one does not need extremely high laser intensities.

Abstract.  Complex  networks  have  been  applied  to  model  numerous  interactive  nonlinear 
systems in the real world. Knowledge about network topology is crucial for understanding the 
function, performance and evolution of complex systems. In the last few years, many network 
metrics have been proposed to illuminate the network topology. Since these network metrics 
derive  from  a  wide  range  of  studies,  a  systematic  study  is  required  to  investigate  the 
correlations  between  them.  The  present  paper  investigates  the  correlations  between  some 
network metrics for an ensemble of graphs where the degree sequence (set of degrees) is fixed. 
We  show  that  networks  with  the  same  power-law  degree  distribution  exhibit  significant 
differences  in  their  topological  features,  as  well  as  in  responses  to  damages.  These  results 
suggest that only the degree distribution is not enough to classify various networks.

1.  Introduction   
Complex networks have been playing an important role in the understanding of many natural 
systems[1-5].  The  empirical  analysis  of  many  real-world  networks  from  various  realms  has 
revealed some common features shared by the individual systems, such as power-law degree 
distribution[6],  modular  or  community  organization[7-10],  small-world  effect  [11],  and 
hierarchical organization [12], as well as some apparent differences between networks, such 
as  the  positive  degree  correlation  in  social  networks  vs.  the  negative  degree  correlation  in 
technological and biological networks[13-18]. At the same time, several network metrics has 
been proposed to describe network topology quantitatively, in which the most important and 

commonly  used  ones  are  the  degree  distribution  [6],  the  characteristic  path  length  [11], 
clustering coefficient [11], modularity[9, 19], and assortative coefficient[14]. However, since 
these  network  metrics  have  derived  from  a  wide  range  of  studies,  a  systematic  study  is 
required to investigate the possible correlations between them.   

In this paper, we study how the network topologies and performances are influenced by 
the  degree  correlation  through  investigating  a  statistical  ensemble  generated  from  a  certain 
“seed”  network,  in  which  the  networks  have  tunable  degree  correlation  while  keeping  the 
degree sequence of the seed network. Three model networks and one real-world network are 
studied as seed networks. 
 
2.  Construction of network ensemble   
 
2.1.   Seed networks under study 
Four networks whose degree distributions obey the power-law are studied as seed networks:   
(1)  Seed  network  A:  the  hierarchically  modular  network  constructed  by  Ravasz  et  al.  (BR 
model)  [20] in the 3rd iteration. At every step, the central node of the central  module is 
connected to the external nodes of the four peripheral modules, resulting in a network of 
disassortative mixing (see figure 1 of [20]). 

(2)  Seed network B:    an assortative model network generated by the BR model as shown in 

figure 1. 

(3)  Seed network C: a model network constructed by the BA preferential attachment model 

with parameter values m = m0 = 3 [6]. 

(4)  Seed  network  D:  the  biggest  connected  cluster  of  the  protein  interaction  network 
CCSB-HI1,  a  proteome-scale  map  of  human  binary  protein–protein  interactions  tested 
from a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid experimental system [21]. 
In  table  1,  we  summarize  the  basic  graph  metrics  of  these  networks.  We  quantify  the 
topological  features  of  the  networks  by  their  characteristic  path  length  (L),  clustering 
coefficient (C) and modularity (M), and the degree correlation by assortative coefficient (r). 
Here,  modularity  metric  (M)  of  a  network  is  defined  as  the  largest  modularity  metric  of  all 
possible partitions of the network [19],  and computed by simulated annealing algorithm[22, 
23].

Figure  1  Another  hierarchical  network  generated  by  the  BR  model  [20].  The  basic 
building  unit  of  BR  model  is  a  densely  linked  5-node  module  (iteration  n=0).  Then,  five 
copies  of  the  basic  unit  are  assembled  into  larger  25-node  module  (iteration  n=1,  52=25 
nodes). Next, five copies of this 25-module are connected again to produce 125-node module 
(iteration  n=2,  53=125  nodes).  This  process  can  be  repeated  indefinitely.  Here  we  show 
another assembling pattern that generates a network of assortative mixing. At each step, we 
connect the central node of each replica to the central node of the original module.   
 
2.2.   Generating extreme networks of degree correlation 
To  construct  the  ensemble  of  networks,  we  first  generated  the  extreme  versions  of  degree 
correlation  from  the  seed  network,  i.e.,  networks  that  have  the  highest  and  lowest  value  of 
assortative coefficient while conserving the degree sequence of the seed network.   

Let G be the seed network, which is a connected simple graph of N nodes and M links. V 
and  E  denote  the  node  set  and  edge  set  of  G  respectively.  The  degree  sequence  for  G  is 

D =

,  where 

id   is  the  degree  of  node  i.    Li  et  al.  [24,  25]  defined  the 

s-metric as the sum of products of degrees of adjacent nodes as follows,

high  s-values  are  achieved  only  by  connecting  high-degree  nodes  to  each  other,  and  low 
s-values are obtained by connecting high-degree nodes only to low-degree nodes. It is proved 

that s-metric is linearly related to the assortativity coefficient as follows [24],

Therefore, for a given degree sequence, the biggest s-value and smallest s-value, denoted by 
Smax and Smin respectively, correspond to the extremes of assortativity. The simple connected 
graphs with the extreme s-values are called Smax graph and Smin graph respectively.     

In this study, we apply the algorithm proposed by Li et al. to construct the Smax graph, in 

which all potential links (i, j) for all node pairs i, j (i<j, 

d ≥
i

d

j

; i, j=1,2,…N) are ordered 

according to their weight didj in a decreasing way, and then one link is added to the edge set at 
a time so as to result in a simple, connected graph of degree sequence D [24].   

Ordering  the  potential  links  (i,  j)  in  a  different  way,  we  modify  the  algorithm  for  Smax 

graph to generate the Smin graph. The detail is as follows: 

1.  Create  the  ordered  list  of  all  potential  links:  First,  order  the  nodes  according  to 

decreasing  values  of  node  degree,  i.e., 

d

.  Then,  for  each  node  i 

(i=1,2,…,N-1), order all of its potential links as

Third, order all potential links of the graph as 

LL

. 

2.  Iterate to add edges from the ordered link list: At every step, checking Condition A-1, 
A-1a  and  A-2  in  reference  [24]  to  select  an  edge  from  the  top  of  ordered  list  of  all 
potential  links,  such  that  the  final  graph  would  have  degree  sequence  D  and  would 
not  be  disconnected  because  of  adding  this  link  to  its  edge  set.  If  a  link  satisfies 
Condition  A-2  and  contradicts  Condition  A-1  and  A-1a  at  the  same  time,  it  can  be 
added  to  the  edge  set,  otherwise  it  cannot.  Once  an  element  in  the  ordered  list  is 
checked, delete it from the list. Repeat this process until the ordered link list becomes 
empty. 
 

The first step of this algorithm insures that the nodes of highest degree are connected to 
nodes of lowest degree while no self-loops and multiple edges are generated. The second step, 
which  is  the  same  as  that  of  [24],  insures  that  the  final  graph  is  a  connected  graph  having 
degree sequence D.   

Figure  2  shows  the  resulting  extreme  networks  for  seed  network  B.  Obviously,  these 
networks are linked in a regular way. In this Smax graph, nodes with similar degrees are linked 
to  form  “cliques”,  while  in  the  Smin  graph,  high  degree  nodes  are  matched  with  low  degree 
nodes  to  form  “bipartite  cliques”,  and  the  remained  unmatched  nodes  are  linked  with  each 
other in a clique-like modular way. According to the definition in [12], this Smax graph is the 
maximally hierarchical version of the graphs having the same degree sequence, while the Smin 
graph is the maximally antihierarchal version of these graphs.   

It is worth to mention that there are a lot of Smax and Smin graphs for a given seed network, 

and we put more discussion at the last section of this paper. 

 

 

Figure  2    The  resulting  extreme  networks  for  seed  network  B.    Nodes  with  different 
degrees are shown in different colours. For clarity, here we draw the Smax and Smin graph for 
the 2nd iterate of network B that have 125 nodes as illustration. 
 
2.3. Constructing network ensemble from the Smax and Smin graphs 
Starting  from  the  Smax  and  Smin  graph  respectively,  we  carried  out  a  series  of  edge  rewiring 
steps  [18,  26],  during  which  two  links  between  two  randomly  selected  pairs  of  nodes  are 
rewired  only  if  this  step  generates  no  multiple  edges  while  keeps  the  graph  connected.  The 
process was repeated pM times in which only performed exchanges were counted, where M is 
the total number of links in the graph, and  p is a positive number representing the rewiring 
fraction  of  links.  Switching  p in  the  area  [0,  3],  we  generated  an  ensemble  of  randomized 
networks  for  the  Smax  graph  and  the  Smin  graph,  respectively.  For  p=0,  the  original  Smax  and 
Smin graph are unchanged.   

 

3. Topological diversity of graphs in the network ensemble 
Figure  2  also  gives  an  intuitionistic  picture  about  the  topologies  of  extreme  graphs.  These 
networks have highly modular organizations, and their modules are linked into a chain. It is 
true that all the resulting extreme networks of the four seed networks, except the Smax graph 
for  seed  network  D,  have  chain-like  structures  with  very  long  paths,  which  break  the 
small-world property found in most real-world networks. That is to say, the characteristic path 
lengths  of  these  networks  are  much  larger  than  those  in  logarithmical  scale  of  the  network 
size. The reason of the exception (the Smax graph for seed network D) is that network D has a 
lot of degree-one nodes that need to link with high-degree nodes for keeping the connectivity 
of  the  network.  The  large-world  phenomenon  in  these  extreme  networks  suggests  that  the 

small-world could not be direct consequence of a power-law degree distribution, in contrast 
with  the  earlier  observations  [27-29].  It  is  noted  that  the  similar  finding  has  been  reported 
recently in [30].

modularity  (M)  and  characteristic  path  length  (L)  as  functions  of  the  randomization 
fraction (p). A logarithmic horizontal scale is used to depict the mini increasing of rewiring 
fraction.  The  data  shown  in  the  figure  are  averaged  over  10  random  realizations  of  the 
rewiring process.

(C1)~(C4): for the Smax graph and Smin graph and their randomized networks of seed network C; 
(D1)~(D4): for the Smax graph and Smin graph and their randomized networks of seed network D. 
 

In  figure  3  we  plot  the  four  topological  metrics  r,  M,  C  and  L  as  a  function  of  the 
rewiring  fraction  p,  respectively.  It  can  be  seen  that  metrics  M,  C  and  L  exhibit  the  same 
decreasing  tendency  with  the  increasement  of  p  (except  for  the  change  tendencies  of  C  for 
Smin graphs in (A2), (C2) and (D2), which will be discussed in detail later), while the change 
tendencies  of  assortative  coefficient  r  for  the  randomization  of  the  Smax  graph  and  the  Smin 
graph  are  opposites.  The  Smax  graph  and  the  Smin  graph  have  the  highest  and  the  lowest 
assortative coefficient respectively, while assortative coefficients for their switching networks 
are between the extreme values. As p increases from 0 to 1, all of the graph metrics change 
accordingly, and they become constant when  p ≥   1. This tendency suggests that the random 

rewiring  process  reaches  a  good  mixing  and  generates  the  completely  random  networks  for 
the degree sequence, after performing more than M times ( p ≥   1). Thus the rewiring process 
allows  us  to  “tune”  the  network  between  the  maximum  and  minimum  level  of  degree 
correlation, and the resulting network ensemble spans the whole range of assortativity based 
on  the  same  degree  sequence.  Therefore,  this  ensemble  could  be  used  to  probe  the 
transformation of network topologies depending on that of its degree correlation.   

Figure  3  (A4)~(D4)  shows  that  both  the  characteristic  path  length  L  and  clustering 
coefficient C are large for Smax graphs at p=0, and approach the minimum value as p ≥ 1. As p 
increases from 0 to 1, L drops rapidly but C decreases slowly. This observation suggests that 
Smax  graphs  are  highly  clustered,  large-world  non-random  networks,  while  their  switching 
networks  corresponding  to  intermediate  values  of  p  interpolate  between  non-random  and 
random  networks  and  exhibit  small-world  feature,  i.e.,  highly  clustered  with  small 
characteristic  path  length  [11].  Thus  our  rewiring  process  shows  how  a  large-world, 
non-random network with power-law degree distribution transits to small-world networks by 
introducing a few short cuts while keeping the power-law degree distribution. This process is 
similar  to  that  in  [11],  whereas  ref.  [11]  rewired  a  regular  lattices  and  didn’t  preserve  its 
degree  sequence.  It  is  noted  that  a  large-world  network  is  so  unstable  that  only  a  tiny 
perturbation  would  tune  it  into  a  small-world.  This  could  be  one  of  the  reasons  for  the 
ubiquity of small-world networks in the real world.   

However,  from  figure  3  (A1)~(D1),  we  can  see  that  the  practice  ranges  of  assortative 
coefficient are far less than the theoretical limit [-1,1], and not all the random networks ( p ≥  
1)  have  assortative  coefficient  near  0.  This  is  because  we  constrain  our  ensemble  of  networks 
contains only simple, connected graphs, whereas the definition of assortative coefficient involves 
no such constraints. In figure 3, only random networks ( p ≥   1) for seed network B and C are 
uncorrelated  networks  with  assortative  coefficient  approximate  to  0,  whereas  random 
networks for both seed network A and D are disassortative mixing with negative assortative 
coefficient.  This  observation  could  be  explained  by  the  structural  cut-off  constraints  that 
simple random graphs whose degree distribution follows a power law with the exponent  γ 

must satisfy the condition of 

N≤Δ

( Δ   and N are the highest degree and total number of 

nodes  respectively)  in  order  to  have  no  degree-correlations  [31].  This  cut-off  constraint  is 

equivalent to 

3≥γ

[31, 32], which is only satisfied by network B and C. Figure 3 (A1) also 

displays that even the assortative coefficient of the Smax graph for seed network A is negative, 
suggesting that any connected simple graph having the same degree sequence as network A is 
disassortative  mixing,  no  matter  how  its  nodes  are  connected.  This  could  be  caused  by  the 

highly heterogeneous distribution of node degree in network A, in which 

>Δ

N

  but the 

1
2

total number of high-degree nodes is much less than  N

. Thus the high-degree nodes have 

1
2

to  link  with  much  more  low-degree  nodes  than  high-degree  ones,  resulting  in  the 
disassortative mixing feature. 

An interesting observation about (A2)~(D2) is that although the C-values of all the Smax 
randomized networks decrease with the increasement of p, as for the Smin randomized graphs, 

only  those  of  seed  network  B  (figure  3  (B2))  have  the  same  change  tendency.  This 
phenomenon  could  be  explained  by  the  definition  of  clustering  coefficient  and  the  linkage 
patterns of Smax and Smin graphs. The clustering coefficient of node v measures the extent that 
its neighbours are also linked together, i.e., to form triangles with node v, and the clustering 
coefficient  of  a  network,  i.e.,  the  average  clustering  coefficient  over  all  v,  measures  the 
enrichment of triangles in the network [11]. On the other hand, these Smax graphs are linked in 
a  clique-like  modular  way  that  include  the  most  triangles.  However,  in  these  Smin  graphs, 
high-degree nodes are matched with low-degree nodes to form bipartite-clique-like modules 
that include no triangles, while only unmatched nodes are linked to get clique-like modules. 
In other words, the number of triangles in Smin graphs depends on the number of unmatched 
nodes.  If  all  the  nodes  are  matched,  i.e.,  the  Smin  graph  is  a  bipartite  graph,  its  clustering 
coefficient equals to 0, the minimum value. Actually, the Smin graphs of seed network C and D 
are  nearly  bipartite  graphs.  For  example,  among  the  1307  nodes  of  network  D,  only  19 
degree-8 nodes are unmatched in the Smin graph. When rewiring the links of such bipartite Smin 
graph,  some  nodes  belonging  to  the  same  partition  may  connect  together  to  form  triangles. 
That’s  why  the  clustering  coefficients  fluctuate  while  rewiring  the  Smin  graphs.  Compared 
with those of figure 3(A2) and (C2), the more remarkable fluctuation of figure 3 (D2) is due 
to its much smaller scale in the plot.     

To investigate the effect of degree correlation on network topologies, we plot clustering 
coefficient,  modularity  and  characteristic  path length  as  a  function  of  assortative  coefficient 
respectively in figure 4.   

Figure 4. Clustering coefficient, modularity and characteristic path length as functions 
of assortative coefficient, respectively.

Figure  4  shows  that  the  closer  the  assortative  coefficient  r  of  a  network  is  to  the 
maximum  or  minimum  value,  the  bigger  its  modularity  M  is,  while  networks  with  high 
modularity  could  have  very  small  clustering  coefficients.  That  is  to  say,  it  is  true  that  the 
formation  of  communities  (or  modules)  could  produce  highly  assortative  mixing  and 
clustering, as Newman et al. argued [16], so could it produce highly disassortative mixing and 
small clustering coefficient.   

This  bifurcation  could  be  caused  by  different  understanding  of  modularity.  Newman 
and  Girvan  simply  defined  modular  networks  (or  community  organized  networks)  as  those 
whose  nodes  could  be  properly  divided  into  groups  within  which  the  nodes  are  highly 
connected, but between which they are much less connected [9]. However, in practice, they 
and some other researchers intuitively considered modular networks as having high clustering 
coefficient, i.e., including a lot of triangles[7, 16]. It is true that social networks exhibit such 
feature  because  friends  of  the  same  people  are  usually  friends  of  each  other,  but  not  all 
real-world networks are like this. For example, a metabolic network could be represented as a 
substrate-reaction bipartite graph, in which one set of nodes corresponds to metabolites, while 
the other set of nodes corresponds to reactions, and a reaction is connected with its substrates 
and products [33-36]. Such a bipartite graph includes no triangles, but it could be decomposed 
into  modules  of  biological  significance  [36].  From  figure  2(B),  we  can  see  that  a  bipartite 
graph, which is disassortative mixing and whose clustering coefficient equals to 0, could be a 
highly modular network according to the definition of [9]. Actually, unipartite networks that 
show both rich and varied community structure as well as disassortative mixing has also been 
found in some network models of mechanical assemblies [37].     

  It can be seen that, like the modularity metric, the characteristic path length also has the 

similar correlation to the assortative coefficient. 

 

4. Network performances under attacks and failures 
At  last,  we  explore  the  effect  of  degree  correlation  on  network  robustness.  We  chose  six 
networks from each of the four network ensembles as listed in table 2, and then studied their 
responses  to  two  ways  of  damages,  i.e.,  intentional  attacks  targeting  hubs  (attacks)  and 
random removal of nodes (failures).   

When some nodes are removed from a network, the network might be fragmentized into 
several sub-networks. Similar as in [38], we  measure the size of the largest sub-network, S, 
shown  as  a  fraction  of  the  size  of  the  original  network,  when  a  fraction  f  of  the  nodes  are 
removed  either  randomly  (failures)  or  in  decreasing  order  of  their  degrees  (attacks).  The 
results are shown in figure 5.   

Comparison of the plots in the left with the corresponding ones in the right shows that, 
these networks would be broken apart into single nodes when no more than 40% hub nodes 

are removed (figures in the left), while this situation would happen only when more than 80% 
nodes are removed randomly (figures in the right). That is to say, just as Albert et al. pointed 
out[38], these networks, all of whose degree distribution obeys a power-law, are resilient to 
random failures but relatively vulnerable to intentional attacks.

Figure 5 Network fragmentations under intentional attacks to hubs and random failures. 
The  plot  shows  the  relative  size  of  the  largest  cluster  S  as  a  function  of  the  fraction  of 
removed nodes f for the four groups of networks listed in table 2. 
 
 

However, although networks in the same group (shown in the same plot) have identical 
degree  sequence,  their  responses  to  damages  are  significantly  different.  It  is  noticeable  that 
although seed network A has been used as a model to characterize real-world networks such 
as  metabolic  networks  and  protein  interaction  networks[20],  it  has  the  lowest  degree  of 
robustness in its group, so does seed network B. This observation suggests that the BR model 
still  has  limitation  in  depicting  real  networks.  Although  seed  network  C’s  performance  to 
attacks  is  nearly  as  good  as  its  randomized  versions,  it  acts  much  worse  to  random  failures 
compared  with  its  randomized  versions.  On  the  contrary,  seed  network  D,  the  real  protein 
interaction  network,  exhibits  almost  the  best  performance  in  its  group  but  the  robust  extent 
has little discrepancy with that of the random ones.   

The  performances  of  extreme  networks  (Smax  and  Smin  graph)  are  also  evidently 
different  from  those  of  the  other  ones  in  the  same  group.  This  could  be  the  effect  of  their 
chain-like structures and the resulting large-world topologies. The three randomized networks 
i.e., networks rewiring from the seed network, Smax and Smin graph respectively, have almost 
the  same  response  to  random  failures.  By  comparison,  for  these  randomized  networks,  the 
endurance  to  intentional  attacks  increases  with  the  increasing  of  assortative  coefficient. 
Therefore,  if  only  consider  random  networks,  our  results  agree  with  the  conclusion  of  [14] 
relating the effect of degree correlation on network robustness, which argued that, compared 

with dissortative networks, assortative networks are more robust to removal of their highest 
degree  nodes.  However,  while  taking  into  account  non-random  networks,  such  as  the  seed 
networks  and  extreme  versions,  our  observations  are  not  compatible  with  that  result.  The 
reason  is  that,  in  the  study  of  [14],  only  networks  generated  from  a  specific  model  were 
considered.   

 

5. Discussion and conclusion 
In this survey we have attempted to study the correlations between the commonly used graph 
metrics  under  the  background  of  power-law  degree  distribution.  The  study  is  based  on  an 
exploring to an ensemble of networks with the same degree sequence.   

We  must  mention  that  due  to  the  process  we  constructed  the  network  ensemble,  the 
resulting ensemble is not likely to give a complete picture of the space of all graphs with the 
same  degree  sequence.  We  first  applied  the  algorithm  in  [24]  to  generate  the  extreme 
networks  of  given  degree  sequence,  then  randomly  reshuffled  the  links  of  the  extreme 
networks  to  get  graphs  with  different  extent  of  degree-correlation.  It  can  be  seen  that  both 
Smax  and  Smin  graph  are  not  unique,  while  the  algorithm  in  [24],  which  is  a  deterministic 
process to check the list of potential links from top to bottom and chooses the links that could 
form a simple connected graph, generates one realization of extreme graphs while running on 
one  list.  Obviously,  there  are  a  lot  of  permutations  that  satisfy  the  Rearrange  Inequality, 
especially  when  the  degree  sequence  includes  many  nodes  of  the  same  degree.  Each 
permutation  could  be  used  as  a  list  of  potential  links  for  Smax or  Smin  graph.  Applying  the 
algorithm  to  different  permutations  would  generate  different  extreme  networks,  which  have 
the  same  s-metric  and  assortative  coefficient  but  might  have  different  L,  C  and  M  values. 
Hence,  the  chain-like  topology  of  Smax and  Smin  graph  we  got  here  is  only  one  of  various 
linkage patterns for these graphs. Taking the graph of figure 2(A) as an example, if we rewire 
those links both of whose end nodes are degree-3 nodes, we will get different versions of Smax 
graph. Because of the diverse topologies of extreme graphs themselves, networks constructed 
from randomly rewiring one version of these graphs is not possible to give a complete view of 
the space of all graphs with the same degree sequence. Hopefully, more research will depict a 
complete picture of this space. 

Another  issue  about  the  algorithm  in  [24]  is  that  such  type  of    “greedy”  heuristic 
procedure  may  have  difficulty  achieving  the  intended  degree  sequence  due  to  the  global 
constraints imposed by connectivity requirements, but it works well in practice for graphs that 
are sufficiently sparse. In addition, to ensure the connectivity of the generated graph, it may 
discard  some  links  with  larger  didj  values  at  earlier  stages.  That  is  to  say,  it  may  fail  to 
generate  a  graph  with  truly  maximum  or  minimum  r-value,  but  it  can  get  graphs  whose 
r-values  are  sufficiently  close  to  the  true  extreme  value.  And  the  r-value  of  extreme  graphs 
constructed from different permutations of potential links may have little discrepancy. 

Although our network ensemble is only a transversal of the graph space with the same 
degree  sequence,  by  investigating  this  ensemble,  we  found  that  networks  with  the  same 
power-law degree sequence could have very different topological features and performances 
under  attacks.  Therefore,  although  networks  with  power-law  degree  distribution  have  been 
defined as scale-free networks[6], our results suggest that, the degree distribution cannot be 
used  as  a  criterion  to  classify  different  category  of  networks.  Furthermore,  our  study  has 

deduced  several  conclusions  that  are  not  consistent  with  those  of  the  earlier  studies,  which 
were  obtained  from  empirical  investigations  to  real-word  networks.  This  indicates  that 
methodology  based  on  purely  empirical  measurements  and  case  studies  to  real-world 
networks has some limitation. The approach used in this study, which compare real networks 
not  only  with  respect  to  its  random  counterparts,  but  also  with  respect  to  non-random  ones 
with  specific  features,  affords  us  much  more  cases  with  comparable  statistical  weight.  This 
approach  may  help  us  to  get  clearer  insight  about  the  topological  properties  of  the  network 
under study, thus could be promising in complex network study.

The initiation of giant electrical discharges called as “gigantic jets” connecting thunderclouds to the

ionosphere is investigated by numerical simulation method in this paper. Using similarity relations, the

triggering conditions of streamer formation in laboratory situations are extended to form a criterion of

initiation of gigantic jets. The energy source causing a gigantic jet is considered due to the quasi-

electrostatic field generated by thunderclouds. The electron dynamics from ionization threshold to

streamer initiation are simulated by the Monte Carlo technique. It is found that gigantic jets are

initiated at a height of ~18-24 km. This is in agreement with the observations. The method presented in

this paper could be also applied to the analysis of the initiation of other discharges such as blue jets

1. Introduction

The lightning from thundercloud toward the ground has been widely studied. It has been found, however, that

more elusive forms, dubbed elves, sprites with and without sprite halos, and blue jets, flit above the thunderclouds.

Recently a new type of lightning, i.e., gigantic jets, was discovered, which linked the top of thunderclouds to the

overlying charged atmosphere, known as the ionosphere. Pasko et al. (2002) reported a video recording of a blue

jet propagating upwards from a thundercloud to an altitude of ~70 km. The event went across the normal upper

limit for blue jets and lower terminal height of sprites. Su et al. (2003) reported their observations of five gigantic

jets that spanned the thundercloud top at 16 km and the ionosphere at an elevation of 90 km within half a second.

The upper body of gigantic jets was very similar to sprites, but their lower body resembled blue jets. These events

are potentially important factors in the model of the earth’s electrical and chemical environment. The investigation

of these events will help us to understand their contribution to the global electrical circuit (Pasko, 2003).

Observations of gigantic jets are not enough to understand the factors causing the initiation of these events

because no associated could-to-ground (CG) lightning discharges were detected in the underlying thunderstorm

(Pasko et al., 2002; Su et al., 2003). The conditions triggering gigantic jets are unknown. Finding such conditions

is the aim of the present work. Since the extremely-low- frequency (ELF) radio waves associated with gigantic

jets were detected in these events and a negative cloud to ionosphere (NCI) discharge could lead to the generation

of these ELF waves (Su el al., 2003), here we consider the initiation criteria for gigantic jets which are NCI

discharges. The energy source causing gigantic jets is assumed to be due to the quasi-electrostatic field generated

by thunderclouds. We calculate the axisymmetrical quasi-electrostatic fields for different thundercloud charges.

The criterion of initiation of gigantic jets is proposed using the extension of the triggering conditions of streamer

1

formation in laboratory situations. The estimated initiation heights are in agreement with the observations. Also,

we simulate electron dynamics from ionization threshold to streamer initiation and give electron energy

distributions at different initiation heights.

2. Thundercloud charge producing a gigantic jet

The charge structure of thunderclouds has been studied extensively for many years. MacGorman and Rust

(1998) proposed a working hypothesis of the gross charge distribution of the thundercloud, i.e., a positive dipole

(positive above negative charge) or a tripole structure with a small lower positive charge plus an upper negative

screening layer. Based on these structures, a positive streamer could be initiated if the quasi-electrostatic field

above thundercloud exceeds the ionization threshold of air (Pasko et al., 1996; Pasko and George, 2002). However,

the hypothesis is inconsistent with the observations of gigantic jets. Pasko et al. (2002) reported that they found an

upward transport of negative charges within a gigantic jet. Based on observational results, Su et al. (2003)

indicated that gigantic jets might be negative could-to-ionosphere (NCI) discharges. Therefore, here we consider

the quasi-electrostatic field above thundercloud generated by thundercloud charge on the basis of a fast

accumulation of a negative charge located at the top of thundercloud. The thundercloud charge dynamics can be

mathematically represented by (Pasko et al., 1997)

Q t( ) = Q0

)
tanh t /t(
tanh 1( )

,

0 < t < t

where Q0 is the magnitude of thundercloud charge and t is the duration for accumulation of thundercloud charge.
Pasko and George (2002) pointed out that the charge accumulation timescale can in some cases be very fast

(fraction of a second). Here we assume the timescale to be ~0.5-1 s. It is noted that the functional variation tanh(⋅)

in eq.(1) is not critical for the physics of the phenomena modeled (Pasko et al., 1997). The thundercloud charge is

VÚ

, where V represents the whole computational domain. The charge density r- (r,z,t) is
Q t( ) = r- (r,z,t)2prdrdz
assumed to be a Gaussian spatial distribution given by r- (r,z,t) = r(t)e- [( z- z - )2 / a 2+r 2 / b 2 ], z- is the mean height of
)(tr is the charge density corresponding to Q(t). In this work we set z- = 16
negative thundercloud charges and
km, a = 2, 4, and 6 km, and b = 2 km. The charge Q(t) for these three cases of a are shown in Fig. 1 as cases 1, 2,

and 3, where tign1, tign2, and tign3 represent the time of initiation of gigantic jets in accordance with three cases of a =
2, 4, and 6 km.

In order to generate a streamer in air there are three conditions to be fulfilled (Raizer et al., 1998). They are

1) The electric field must exceed the ionization threshold;

2) The initial plasma patch is sufficiently ionized so that the electric field generated by the space charges is

comparable with the external field itself;

3) A seed of free electrons is required to start the ionization.

It is known that a minimum electric field strength is required to support stable streamer propagation. Here we

pay our attention on negative streamer propagation. The minimum field –Ec required for propagation of negative
streamers in air at atmospheric pressure is about –12.5 kV/cm (Babaeva and Naidis, 1997), which value has been
3.14 ¥106  V ⋅ m-1 causes a

used to study blue jets (Pasko and George, 2002). The electric field of

=0E

breakdown of an air gap of 1 cm at atmospheric pressure and produces an effective ionization coefficient

=effa
1.24 ¥103  m-1 (Raizer et al., 1998). The electric field for ionization threshold is estimated by E k = E 0 ⋅ (N / N 0) ,
where N 0 = 2.688 ¥1025  m-3 and N is the number density of air molecules, taken from US Standard Atmosphere
(1976). In this work, we use a simple method to estimate the interaction of charged particles with the external field.

The electric field inside a plasma patch generated by electrons and ions is assumed to be equivalent to that caused

by the electric dipole such that positive and negative charges locate at the centre of positive ions and electrons,

respectively. The electric field in the middle of the electric dipole can be simply given by

E d / 2 =

q
2pe0(d /2)2

,

where d is the distance of electric dipole, e0 is the permittivity of free space, and q is the charge of the electric
dipole. We consider that a streamer is initiated if the electric field generated by electrons and ions makes the
electric field inside the plasma patch reduce from Ek to E c ⋅ (N / N 0) . Therefore, we obtain the minimum number
Nmin of electrons generating a streamer in upper atmosphere by
N min = 8.68 ¥107(E 0 - E c) ⋅ (N /N 0) ⋅ d 2

(3)

The third condition to initiate a streamer can be naturally fulfilled in the domain close to the top of

thundercloud if we consider gigantic jets which are negative cloud to ionosphere (NCI) discharges. Our

calculation is terminated once the electron number exceeds Nmin. After that, a streamer will be initiated to form a
gigantic get.

4. Quasi-electrostatic field generated by thundercloud charge

The two-dimensional cylindrical coordinate system (r,z) is used, where the z axis represents the height. The

computational domain is r £ 60 km and 0 £ z £ 90 km. We assume that the quasi-electrostatic (QE) field is

axisymmetrical. The three boundaries at z = 0 km, z = 90 km, and r = 60 km are assumed to be perfectly

conducting. The effect of the artificial boundary at r = 60 km on the QE field is considered as small (Pasko et al.,

1997).

The continuity equation on the basis of charge conservation law is (Tong et al., 2004)

∂r
∂t

+ —s⋅ E + rs/e0 = 0 ,

— ⋅ E = (r+ rs) /e0 ,

where r is the charge density, s is the conductivity, and t is the time. E is electrostatic field governed by

(2)

(4)

(5)

where rs is the thundercloud source charge density, i.e., rs = r- in this work. Before the ionization threshold is
reached, electron conductivity below 60 km height is low. Therefore the total conductivity s is dominated by ion
conductivity, taken by s = 5 ¥10-14e z / 6km S/m (Dejnakarintra and Park, 1974). The ordinary finite difference method
(Potter, 1973) is used to solve eq. (4). The Fourier transform method and Thomas algorithm (Hockney and

Eastwood, 1988) are used to solve eq.(5).

5. Monte Carlo method simulating electron dynamics

The one-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation starts at the time that electric field arrives at ionization threshold.

Several hundred, or thousand, electrons are assumed as emitted from the top of thunderclouds. The equation of

motion for the electrons is simulated by the modified Verlet method (Ueda, 1990)

z(t + Dt) = z(t) + v z (t)Dt + Fz (t)(Dt)2 /2m ,

v z (t + Dt) = v z (t) + [Fz (t + Dt) + Fz (t)]Dt /2m ,

(1985). For

the estimation of electron-molecule collisions, Nanbu (1994) proposed a simple method to

simultaneously determine whether an electron collides and which collisional event occurs in the case of collision.

By the method, we obtain the collision probability of the ith electron for the kth collisional type in (cid:262)t

Pk = nnsk (ei )viDt ,

( k = 1,2, …,K )

where, ei and vi are the energy and speed of the ith electron, sk (ei ) is the cross section of the ith electron for the
kth type collision, nn is the density of neutral gas, N2 or O2, and K is the total number of collisional types, i.e., K =
33 in the present work. The total probability that an electron collides with a molecule in (cid:262)t is

PT =

Based on eq. (10), the method to sample a collisional event is shown in Fig. 2. The unit length is divided into K

equal intervals and each interval is divided into two. We call a uniform random number U (0 < U < 1). The

integral part of KU+1 is the number of the kth interval in which U lies. The left part of the kth interval is regarded

as 1/K-Pk and its right part is Pk. If U lies in Pk, the kth event occurs; otherwise the particle does not collide.
Regarding the method for determining the post-collisional velocity of electron, please see Nanbu (2000).

6. Results and discussion

We simulate the evolution of electric field and charge density during the accumulation of thundercloud charge

for cases 1-3. Figure 3 shows the distribution of electric fields along z-axis for cases 1-3. The electric field

generated by thundercloud charges just exceeds the critical field Ek for ionization. The first initiation condition of
a gigantic jet is fulfilled. Table I gives the thundercloud charge Q, the height H of ionization threshold, and the

time tioz corresponding to Fig. 3. tioz is the duration from the accumulation of thundercloud charge to such a case
that ionization threshold of air is reached, i.e., E ≥ Ek at t = tioz.

As seen in Table I,

the heights of 18.63-23.55 km for ionization threshold are in agreement with the

observations of Su et al. (2003). They reported that an apparent emerging point of the gigantic jets started from the

heights of 18 km, 22 km, and 24 km. The thundercloud charges of 200-400 C have been used to study sprites and

blue jets (Pasko et al, 1996, 1997). The magnitudes of charges shown in Table I could be reached by the

accumulation of thundercloud.

In the Monte Carlo simulation we consider that the neutral gases are composed of 80% N2 and 20% O2. We
assume that about one thousand electrons are emitted at the heights of ionization threshold. Then the electrons are

accelerated and collide with neutral air molecules. We follow electron dynamics until the electron number reaches

Nmin given by eq. (3). The time tstr to initiate a streamer from ionization threshold is 1.94, 2.53, and 3.68 ms for
cases 1-3, respectively. The initiation time of gigantic jets is estimated as tign = tioz + tstr. Figure 4 gives the
distribution of electrons at the time of initiation of gigantic jets. The coordinate z is counted from the ionization

height H shown in Table I. For the ionization at a lower height, the motion of electrons is spatially more restricted

due to high atmospheric pressure. With the increase of ionization height, electrons start to disperse, such is seen in

case 3 in Fig. 4.

In this work we examined the electron energy distribution. The electron energy distribution E (e) at the time of

initiation of gigantic jets is given in Fig. 5. As seen in Fig. 5, the EEDs for cases 1-3 have a similar distribution,

deviating from Maxwellian. The distribution has a high energy tail in which the energies of only a few electrons

are over the ionization thresholds of gases, i.e., 15.58 eV for N2 and 12.1 eV for O2 (Tong et al., 2004). The
calculation shows that the largest electron energy appears around ~16-20 eV. The average electron energy is ~4.97
5

eV, which is consistent with the previous research (~5 eV) of sprites (Pasko et al., 1997).

We investigate the initiation of gigantic jets connecting thunderclouds to the ionosphere by numerical

simulation method. A criterion determining the initiation of gigantic jets is proposed on the basis of the triggering

conditions of streamer formation in laboratory situations. Based on the present model, we found that the gigantic

jets appear at ~18-24 km height, which is consistent with the observations. The electron energy distribution during

the initiation of gigantic jets deviates from Maxwellian distribution. The average electron energy is ~4.97 eV and

the largest electron energy reaches ~16-20 eV.

The present model presents the first step in studying gigantic jets. In reality, the gigantic jets possess a number

of branches generated by different charged plasma channels. Studies of multiple streamers in the upper

atmosphere is a much more complicated problem, which will be our next aim. These studies will make us have a

better understanding for gigantic jets, a new giant electrical discharge phenomenon. This is not only interesting for

basic science, but also important for solving aeronautics problems in the future.

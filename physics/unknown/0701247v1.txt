Abstract:  Fresnel  lens  has  a  long  history  in  optics.  This  concept  at  non-optical  wavelengths  is 
also  applicable.  In  this  paper  we  report  design  and  fabrication  of  a  half  and  quarter  wave 
dielectric  Fresnel  lens  made  of  Plexiglas,  and  a  Fresnel  reflector  at  11.1  GHz  frequency.  We 
made  two  lenses  and  one  reflector  at  same  frequency  and  compare  their  gain  and  radiation 
pattern to simulated results. Some methods for better focusing action will be introduced.

I. Introduction 
Fresnel  Zone  Plate  (FZP)  is  a  planar  structure  that  can  convert  an  incident  plane  wave  into  a 
spherical wave front that converges at a focal point. Depending on type of material of FZP, we 
have  FZP  reflector  (metal)  or  FZP  lens  (dielectric).  In  both  types,  this  is  diffraction  not 
refraction  that  causes  convergence  of  spherical  reflected/transmitted  wave.  A  circular  FZP 
consists of a number of circular Fresnel zones that their radii are determined by:

Where F is focal length, 
0(cid:4) is free-space wavelength and p is an integer. Circular ring between 
two adjacent circles is a Fresnel zone. If p=1, Fresnel zones will be called full-wave zones and if 
p=2  these  zones  are  half-wave  zones  and  so  on.  In  simple  FZPs  ,  odd/even  zones  are 
opaque/absorbing.  Reflection  form  surface  of  such  metallic  Fresnel  zones  or  transmission 
through  a  transparent  dielectric  Fresnel  zones  will  result  in  amplitude  amplification.  Based  on 
scalar  diffraction  theory  and  using  geometry  shown  in  Fig.1  we  can  calculate  distribution  of 
field amplitude in focal plane as [1]:

Equation (3) cannot be calculated analytically and we must evaluate it numerically. Making this, 
we have field distribution as a function of(cid:7).

II. Modified FZP's 

 

 
In  simple  FZP's  ,  it  is  only  a  fraction  (half)  of  plate  surface  that  contributes  in  concentrating 
wavefront. In such conditions we need a plate with large area to increasing gain to a sufficient 
level. If the last zone have radius  Nr is equal to radius of the plate (D/2), solving equation (1) for 
N we have

From above equation, it is apparent that for constant (F/D), N will increase directly with

In optical wavelengths and lower (e.g. x-ray), there will be a large number of Fresnel zones on a 
plate  with  a  small  diameter  and  without  any  modification  we  will  have  high  gain.  But  at 
centimeter wavelengths we will need large surface simple FZP's .Increasing FZP diameter will 
increase  weight  and  cost  of lens or reflector. Thus we must increase number of Fresnel Zones 
without  diameter  increasing.  To  utilize  the  opaque  zone  apertures,  Wiltse  [2]  replaced  the 
reflecting (or absorbing) rings by phase-reversing (half-wave) dielectric rings. Based on this lens 
various FZP antennas with a radiation efficiency of 25-30% were developed and studied [2], [3].

In  some  other  works  [4]  ,  this  phase  correction  is caused by using rings  with  different 
dividing each full-wave Fresnel zone to a number of subzones and making appropriate changes 
in  them  (e.g.  changing  depth  by  cutting groves) we will expect better results. By a ray tracing 
analysis  using  geometry  shown  in  Fig.3,  we  can  drive  appropriate  depth  of  phase  step  (d) 
necessary for a (cid:8) phase shift:

called  phase  reversing  zone  plate.  If  a  plane  wave  is  normally  incident  on  zone  plate,  the 
portions  of  radiation  which  pass  through  or  reflect  from  various  parts  of  the  transparent 
(reflecting)  zones  all  reach  the  selected  focal  point  with  phases  which  differ  by  less than  one-
half period. Thus, the zone plate acts like a lens, producing a focusing action on the radiation it 
transmits  or  reflects.  In  case  of  dividing  each  full  zone  to  m  phase  step  (subzone)  Eq.(5)  will 
have this form:

III. Calculations 

Based on equation (2) and using a Matlab code for numerical integration, we can calculate field 
distribution around focal point. Equation (2) gives n-th zone contribution in total field amplitude 
at the focal point. If we divide each full-wave zone on dielectric FZP lens into m suzones and 
cutting groves with depths resulted from Eq. (6), then the total field amplitude at the focal point 
is equal to this weighted sum:

Where

N is total number of full zones on the FZP. Using a Matlab code , radiation pattern for half-wave 
(m=2) and quarter-wave(m=4) FZP lens were calculated , results are shown in Fig.3 and Fig.4.

IV. Experimental 

 
We used Plexiglas (Polymetthylmethacrylate) with mass density of 1.19 g/cm3 as Lens material. 
Wavelength  (cid:4) is 2.7cm. For  
r(cid:17) measurement we applied two techniques, a Pseudo-Brewster’s 
Angle Method [5] and a waveguide method, from both techniques it found to be 2.63. First we 

fabricated a Fresnel lens with m=2 (Fig.5 & Fig.6). Design parameters of this lens are listed in 
table.1.

Then by cutting, we converted each zone into a concave surface, then covered it by Aluminum 
sheet, this is a segmented Fresnel reflector (Fig.7).

Using a horn antenna, radiation pattern of fabricated lens and reflector were measured (Fig.8 &

Then  we  made  another  lens  with  m=4.  an  schematic  view  of  this  lens  is  shown  in  Fig.10  and 
Fig.11.

V. Conclusions 
Radiation pattern and gain of fabricated lenses and reflector were made in K.N.T University of 
technology,  Tehran,  Iran.  In  these  measurements, we used a horn feed with gain equal to  17.5 
dB. Radiation patterns are shown in Fig.8, Fig.9 and Fig.12. Other measurements are shown if 
Table.2. These results are in good agreement with calculated radiation patterns shown in Fig.3 
and  Fig.4.    For  example,  from  Fig.3,  calculated  first  sidelobe  level  is  -16.7dB  and  measured 
value  is  -16.dB  (Fig.8),  also  3dB  width  of  measured  radiation  pattern  (Fig.8)  and  calculated 
radiation  pattern  (Fig.3)  are  very  close  to  each  other.  The  measured  value  is  5  degree  and 
calculated value is 4 degree.

As  can  be  seen  from  Table.2,  segmented  reflector  has  the  worst  results;  it  can  be  caused  by 
shadowing  effect  due  to  the  wooden  fixtures  applied  for  horn  feed  mounting  (Fig.11). 
Comparison between 2-step and 4-step lenses reveals that they have nearly same 3dB width, but 
the  4-step  lens  has  a  sharper  pattern  than  2-step  lens,  the  2-step  lens  has  higher  gain.  This  is 
because  the  greater  thickness  of  4-step  lens  (Fig.10)  in  central  region  in  comparison  to  2-step 
lens (Fig.5).

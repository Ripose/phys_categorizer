High Performance Electrostatic 
Sensors and Actuators for LISA 
Proof Mass Control.

Abstract.

This document contains two presentations which describe the
working principles of a class of electrostatic multidimensional
sensors and force actuators.
The subject of the study is the search of the most effective methods
for measuring the position of a cubical conducting proof mass
which floats in a weightless environment. 
The same proof mass must be controlled with a feedback loop
by applying forces with the same set of electrodes.

At the equilibrium, i.e. with the values shown in the above schematic,
v(t)= vref(t)= potential of the proof mass, because the bridge is balanced.

For DC balance R must be as high as possible, but much less than stray resistances.
For AC balance R must have a capacitor in parallel to compensate for stray 
capacitances in transformers.

Various options possible for the right RLC circuits: for instance, overdamped (or critically 
damped) resonant at the bridge frequency or overdamped resonant at a much lower 
frequency.

CONCLUSION: CA and CB could divert a part of generator current, but virtual ground at
the proof mass is still possible with the floating “baluned” preamplifier.

10) Possible use of a single frequency for AC multidimensional actuators.

Disadvantages of the proposed configuration.

1) Four electrodes for each degree of freedom for push-pull operations,
compared to two electrodes for more conventional configurations 
which might employ an injection electrode.

Combination of a double bridge and a split 
electrode actuator.

The double bridge in its different possible configurations can be 
combined with the split electrode actuator for a complete system, 
without loosing the advantages of each configuration. In the 
following example the bridge frequency is much higher than 
actuator frequency (if an AC actuator schema is employed).

Water bath calorimetry was used to demonstrate one more peculiar phenomenon 

associated with a certain class of mixed gas plasmas termed resonant transfer, or 

RT plasmas.  Specifically, He/H2 (10%) (500 mTorr), Ar/H2 (10%) (500 mTorr), 

and H2O(g) (500 and 200 mTorr) plasmas generated with an Evenson microwave 

cavity  consistently  yielded  on  the  order  of  50%  more  heat  than  non  RT  plasma 

(controls)  such  as  He,  Kr,  Kr/H2  (10%),  under  identical  conditions  of  gas  flow, 

pressure, and microwave operating conditions.  The excess power density of RT 

plasmas  was  of  the  order  10  W  ·    cm-3.    In  earlier  studies  with  these  same  RT 

plasmas  it  was  demonstrated  that  other  unusual  features  were  present  including 

dramatic  broadening  of  the  hydrogen  Balmer  series  lines,  unique  vacuum 

ultraviolet (VUV) lines, and in the case of water plasmas, population inversion of 

the  hydrogen  excited  states.    Both  the  current  results  and  the  earlier  results  are 

completely  consistent  with  the  existence  of  a  hitherto  unknown  exothermic

I.  INTRODUCTION 

 

 

Water  bath  calorimetry  studies  were  performed  on  certain  novel  gas  mixture  plasmas 

containing  hydrogen  such  as 

2H/He

(10%), 

2H/Ar

(10%),  and 

( )gOH 2

  called  resonant 

transfer or RT plasmas, and the heat produced was compared to non RT plasmas such as  He , 

Kr ,  and 

2H/Kr

(10%).    The  objective  was  to  provide  yet  another  test  of  a  new  theory  of 

quantum  physics  [1-17]  .  Earlier  experiments  designed  to  test  key  aspects  of  this  theory  have 

produced  spectroscopic  evidence  consistent  with  predictions.    The  present  study,  which 

compares the heat produced by RT and control plasmas run under identical plasma operating 

conditions,  yielded  further  results  consistent  with  an  extraordinary  'chemical'  process  taking 

place  in  RT  plasmas.    To  the  present  authors,  there  does  not  appear  to  be  a  'conventional' 

explanation of the results based on currently accepted scientific theories.  

 

A key aspect of the new theory is the hypothesis that bound electrons are stable (non-

radiative)  physical  particles  of  specific  geometry  that  obey  all  of  Maxwell’s  Laws,  the 

requirements of relativity and all the laws of mechanics.  For hydrogen atoms, the electrons are 

“orbitspheres”  that  surround  the  nucleus,  in  quantized  states  with  the  same  quantized  energy 

levels  that  satisfy  the  Schroedinger  equation  for  hydrogen,  with  significant  exceptions.  

Specifically,  the  exception  are  quantum  states  of  hydrogen  in  which  the  principal  quantum 

number  is  a  fraction  (n =

; 

p =

 in the Rydberg equation for hydrogen excited states).  It is understood that states 

with  the  same  energies  predicted  by  the  new  theory  can  also  be  obtained  from  the 

Schroedinger wave equation, using fractional values for n (the principle quantum number), but 

3 

such ‘fractional states’ are dismissed as being non-physical, because hitherto there has been no 

experimental evidence supporting their existence.  In contrast, the Mills prediction is not only 

that there are stable states with these energies, but that it is possible to create conditions in a 

laboratory  plasma  capable  of  effecting  transitions  to  these  ‘fractional’  states.    In  particular, 

electrons in the H-atom will fall into these states if certain species are present which singly or 

multiply ionize at integer multiples of the potential energy of atomic hydrogen, 

E h =

eV 2.27

 

where 

hE  is one Hartree.  Specific species (e.g. 

+He , 

+Ar , O2, and  O2 ) identifiable on the 

basis of their known electron energy levels are required to be present in plasmas with atomic 

hydrogen to catalyze the process.  Indeed, species such as atoms or ions of  Kr  or  Xe  as well 

as 

2N   or 

2CO   do  not  fulfill  the  catalyst  criterion—a  chemical  or  physical  process  with  an 

enthalpy  change  equal  to  an  integer  multiple  of 

hE   that  is  sufficiently  reactive  with  atomic 

hydrogen under reaction conditions.   

 

Spontaneous  emission  of  photons  to  create  these  fractional  states  is  forbidden  in  the 

Mill’s  quantum  theory.    Catalyst  species  must  be  present  for  the  transitions  to  be  observed 

since the transition requires a nonradiative resonant energy transfer to the catalyst.  Moreover, 

the energy released by transitions to the fractional n=1/p would be very large compared to even 

the most energetic chemical reactions (e.g. tens of eV vs. <2 eV).  The smallest energy change 

(i.e., 

n

=→=

n

1

2/1

)  releases  40.8  eV.    Clearly  such  large  energy  quanta  released  in  a 

plasma are capable of producing dramatic effects.  

 

The  first  of  three  earlier  tests  which  produced  results  consistent  with  the  model 

demonstrated that extreme (>20-200 eV) hydrogen Balmer series line broadening, clearly due 

to the Doppler effect, is found only in those mixed gas plasmas containing species predicted to 

have catalytic properties.  (It must be noted that the most dramatic evidence was always found 

4 

with microwave plasmas generated with an Evenson cavity.)  Line broadening was not found 

for  any  other  (non-hydrogen)  species  in  these  plasmas.    Mills  et  al.  [5-6,  14-17]  showed  that 

hydrogen  line  broadening  was  found  in 

2H/He

(10%), 

2H/Ar

(10%),  and  water  vapor 

plasmas as well as certain hydrogen plasmas with gaseous inorganic atoms or ions [2, 4, 9, 13, 16].  

Superficially similar plasmas, such as 

2H/Kr

, 

2H/Xe

, and 

2 H/N

2

, 

CO

2 H/

2

, etc. which do 

not  contain  species  with  the  catalytic  requirements  of  the  Mills  model,  did  not  show  this 

broadening.    Several  other  groups  also  found  extreme  Doppler  line  broadening  of  hydrogen 

Balmer  lines  of  a  similar  magnitude  in 

2H/Ar

  plasmas  [18-24].    These  groups  proffered 

explanations,  all  requiring  acceleration  of  ions  toward  a  cathode,  and  all  peculiar  to 

2H/Ar

 

plasmas that do not appear to explain the similar broadening found in 

2H/He

, 

( )gOH 2

, etc. 

plasmas.    Indeed,  no  group,  other  than  Mills  et  al.,  put  forth  the  prediction  that  the  line 

broadening would be found in any plasma other than the 

2H/Ar

 plasma. Moreover, in recent 

work it was demonstrated that line broadening can be found only for the Balmer series line in 

low  pressure  (<0.5  torr)  He/H2  plasmas25,  pure  water  plasmas26,  and  Ar/H2  plasmas  27.  In 

Xe/H2  plasmas  no  broadening  was  found.  These  results  suggest  that  the  broadening  is  not 

related to field acceleration,  nor the presence of argon. 

 

A second finding consistent with the Mills model is that the unique line broadening is 

not produced by the fields present in a plasma.  Earlier groups specifically postulated that the 

extreme  Doppler  hydrogen  line  broadening  found  in  mixed  gas  plasmas  is  due  to 

+
2H  

acceleration  by  the  cathode,  and  subsequent  neutralization,  dissociation,  and  emission.    Yet, 

Mills  et  al.  observed  the  line  broadening  in  (electrodeless)  microwave  plasmas  [15-17].  

Moreover, in a pure water plasma, the line broadening (undiminished in magnitude) persists at 

5 

a distance of more than 5 cm from the microwave coupler  [28].  Given that ion acceleration is 

absolutely  minimal  in  microwave  systems,  and  that  the  strong  fields  are  confined  almost 

entirely  to  the  region  of  the  coupler,  these  findings  indicate  that  the  process  that  creates  the 

broadened  lines  is  a  local  one  that  can  take  place  in  low  field  regions.    This  conclusion  is 

further  strengthened  by  the  finding  in  water  plasmas  that  population  inversion  of  atomic 

hydrogen  excited  states  ('pumping')  is  also  found  at  distances  greater  than  5  cm  from  the 

microwave  coupler.  Given  that  the  excited  hydrogen  states  producing  the  Balmer  lines  have 

lifetimes of the order of 10 −7  s (which translates to less than 1 mm of travel) it is clear that the 

excited  state  populations  observed  spectroscopically  are  created  at  the  point  of  observation.  

Again, these findings are consistent with a novel 'chemical' process involving hydrogen and a 

catalyst.  To the authors of this study it does not appear that there is a conventional explanation 

sufficient to satisfy all of these observations simultaneously.  

A third finding consistent with the novel model, one which is particularly compelling, 

is  that  the  VUV  spectral  lines  predicted  by  the  Mills  model  are  present  at  the  predicted 

wavelengths in RT plasmas and not in any similar control plasma [5-7, 10-12].  There appears to be 

no conventional explanation for the novel VUV lines, which occur only in mixtures containing 

hydrogen and one of the Mill’s predicted catalyst gases.   

The  present  study  was  designed  to  test  a  fourth  prediction  of  the  model,  namely  the 

possibility  of  the  transitions  of  electrons  to  deep  lying  fractional  quantum  states  producing 

measurable  amounts  of  thermal  energy.    Significant  heat  is  released  in  RT  plasmas  by  the 

process  of  electron  transitions  to  fractional  n-states  effected  by  a  catalyst  which  resonantly 

accepts 

eV 2.27m ⋅

  wherein  m   is  an  integer.    A  simple  formula  provides  the  energy  of 

 

 

transition to each of these states [7]:

where  p  and  m  are  integers  and  ni = 1/(p+m)  designate  the  initial  and  final  energy  states 

corresponding to the principal quantum number n in the Rydberg formula. 

Clearly  even  the  lowest  energy  transition  of  the  electron  of  atomic  hydrogen  to  a 

fraction Rydberg state releases significant energy that can be observed as heat.  Specifically, 

only the Mills model predicts that the energy output of RT plasmas should be higher than that 

of  controls  for  identical  power  inputs  due  to  the  catalytic  process.    Thus,  the  present 

experiment was designed to compare/contrast the heat output to a water bath by control and RT 

plasmas  operated  under  identical  conditions  to  test  the  so-called  Mills  hypothesis  of  heat 

production.  

 This  last  hypothesis,  if  true,  provides  the  basis  for  interest  in  this  subject  for  the  applied 

physics community.  If heat can be released via this process in a reproducible and consistent 

fashion,  then  transitioning  hydrogen  to  fractional  states  represents  a  truly  novel  source  of 

chemical  energy.  In  fact,  on  a  per  hydrogen  atom  basis,  this  process  is  predicted  to  produce 

tens to hundreds of times more energy than any combustion process. And, as discussed below, 

the present results are consistent with the following interpretation: energy was produced at a 

steady rate of about 10 W/cm3, via transitions of hydrogen to fractional quantum states, over a 

small volume of the plasma, for all the RT plasmas studied.

II.  EXPERIMENTAL 

 

 

 

 

A  unique  apparatus  was  designed  for  this  experiment.    The  design  goals  of  the 

equipment were first, to allow high precision, reliable, absolute measurements of the amount of 

heat  output  from  Evenson-cavity-generated  microwave  plasmas,  and  second  to  quantify  the 

microwave power to the plasmas.  Meeting these goals allows a proper test of the Mills heat 

production hypothesis.  

The first goal was achieved by using a water bath calorimeter (Figures 1-2) designed 

such  that  the  entire  discharge  tube  was  submerged.    A  water  bath  instrument  was  judged 

superior to alternative calorimeter designs as all power generated by the plasma is absorbed by 

the water, there is no electrical signal that might somehow be corrupted, no 'partial' signal that 

must be integrated, etc.   

The  water  bath  calorimeter  described  previously  [29]  was  calibrated  using  a  precision 

electrical resistor circuit (Watlow 125A65A2X, powered with a Xantrex DC power supply, 0-

1200  +/-.01  W)  permanently  installed  within  the  water  tight  cavity  surrounding  the  Evenson 

cavity coupler (Figures 1-2).  Repeated calibration experiments were conducted at 25-100 W 

inputs which essentially measured the system heat capacity.  The heat capacity was found, as 

expected,  to  be  independent  of  the  power  input,  and  the  precision  of  the  measurement  was 

found to be +/-0.5%.  It should be noted that the temperature rise of the 45 liter, distilled-water 

bath  (always  linear,  see  Figure  3)  was  measured  both  with  a  mercury  thermometer  with  a 

resolution of 0.05 K, and a linear-response thermistor probe (Omega OL-703) with a precision 

of  +/-0.001  K.    Both  measures  provided  absolute  calibration  (heat  capacity, 

pC )  constants 

(J/°K) within 2% of that calculated on the basis of the mass of water in the bath and the amount 

8 

is 

 

 

of glass and metal in the Evenson cavity cage and quartz discharge tube.  As the latter values 

are  estimates,  the  calibrated  values  were  used.    Subsequent  heating  rates  are  reported  on  the 

basis of computer-collected thermistor readings, although in most cases, mercury thermometer 

readings were made at regular intervals as an added check.

where H's are enthalpy values (inlet and outlet gases as indicated by the subscripts in and out, 

respectively, and the hat designates per mole),  M&  is the molar flow rate, and the  Q& 's are heat 

flow rates.  It is clear from Eq. (2) that a correction must be considered both for the gas flow 

term (first term, right side), '

powerQ&
 
cable

' which represents the input of the short section (approx. 

3 cm length) of the coaxial cable housing that passes through the water bath as it brings power 

to the microwave power coupler, for the work of the stirrer, and for the heat exchange between 

the insulated water bath and it surroundings.  

 

The  values  of  '

powerQ&
 
cable

'  and  the  heat  carried  out  with  the  gas  were  small,  as 

determined  by  appropriate  temperature  readings.    Thermocouples  were  employed  to  measure 

the  temperature  of  the  input  and  output  gas,  as  well  as  the  temperature  of  the  coaxial  cable 

housing just outside the water bath.  Given that the temperature of the cable housing was never 

more  than  3  K  higher  than  the  water  bath, 

powerQ&
 
cable

  can  readily  be  shown  to  be  negligible.  

The gas temperature change between input to the plasma and output from the water bath was 

never  more  than  1  K.    Heat  transfer  from  the  quartz  tube  containing  the  flowing  gas  to  the 

water in the bath was clearly very efficient.  Given the maximum flow rate was 10 sccm, this 

9 

requires a maximum correction of less than 10 −5  W, a trivial correction.  The stirrer and heat 

exchange  terms  were  found  to  be  the  most  significant  correction,  but  its  value  was  readily 

determined by measuring the temperature rise with only the stirrer operating.  This correction 

can be accurately calculated from the slope of the pre- and post-heating periods and was found 

to  be  constant  and  of  the  order  of  1  W  for  all  experiments.    Once  these  relatively  trivial 

corrections are made the 'effective' energy balance becomes:    

QH &
& =

 

plasma

The calibration procedure resulted in a linear change in temperature for constant power inputs.  

This  is  expected  given  the  nearly  constant  heat  capacity  of  water  over  small  changes  in 

temperature (<3 K in all cases).  Thus, changes in enthalpy can be readily equated with change 

in temperature of the bath.  In short:

Thus, one must only multiply the calibration constant by the rate of change of bath temperature 

to  obtain  the  plasma's  heating  power  of  the  water  bath.    In  the  event  that  the  change  in 

temperature is nearly linear with time, as it was in all cases in this study, the rate (W) of heat 

input from the plasma to the bath can be readily determined, and compared with the microwave 

input power.  

 

The microwave plasmas were generated, in a 1.27 cm OD U-shaped quartz tube about 

20 cm in length (Figures 1-2), using an Opthos model MPG-4M generator (2.45 GHz, E-mode) 

as  described  previously  [26].    The  glowing  plasma  volume  was  about  3 

3cm   in  the  metal 

encased U-tube, about one-half that observed in 'open' straight tubes where the cavity was not 

surrounded by a metal housing.  Gas pressure (other than for some water vapor and Kr studies) 

was  maintained  at  500  mTorr,  measured  with  a  0-10  Torr  MKS  absolute  pressure  Baratron, 

10 

using a molecular drag pump.  Flow rates, other than for water vapor, were maintained at 10 

sccm  with  0-20  sccm  mass  flow  controllers  (MKS).    For  the  water  plasmas,  weight  loss 

measurements showed the flow rates to be about 1 sccm.   

 

 

The  second  goal  of  quantifying  the  microwave  input  power  to  the  plasmas  was 

achieved  by  maintaining  forward  and  reflected  powers,  as  measured  with  power  diodes, 

identical  in  all  cases.    That  is,  for  both  the  RT  and  control  plasmas,  the  power  supply  and 

Evenson cavity tuning were adjusted such that the forward and reflected powers indicated by 

the power reading diodes (Agilent) of the Opthos generator were identical. 

In general, the ultimate basis of any microwave power measurement is a direct absolute 

calorimetric  determination  on  an  instrument  which  then  serves  as  a  primary  standard  for 

secondary  measurements.    In  our  experiments,  that  absolute  standard  was  the  water  bath 

calorimeter  at  fixed  forward  and  reflected  power  diode  settings.    For  example,  with  the 

assumption  that  krypton  plasma  (non  RT  plasma)  does  not  produce  excess  heat,  the  power 

dissipated in the load is absolutely known at particular fixed forward and reflected power diode 

readings from the calorimetric measurement.  Thus, if the diode values are matched identically 

for any other plasma load, the power dissipated in that load must be identical since the system 

and  the  measured  power  flows  are  identical.    This  was  tested  by  running  40  control  non  RT 

plasmas  of  various  pure  gases  and  gas  mixtures  (e.g.  He ,  Ar ,  Kr , 

2H/Kr

,  Xe , 

2H/Xe

, 

2N , 

2 H/N

2

, 

2CO , 

CO

2 H/

2

)  with  different  pressures  and  mixture  ratios.    The  resulting 

common  water  bath  reading  served  as  the  calibration  of  the  input  power  to  RT  plasmas 

(

2H/He

(5%), 

2H/He

(10%), 

2H/Ar

(3%), 

2H/Ar

(10%),  and 

( )gOH 2

).    That  is,  since 

presumably  the  electron  density,  electron  temperature,  ionization  fraction,  hydrogen  atom 

density  and  energy,  and  gas  temperature  are  different  for  all  plasmas,  if these factors impact 

11 

the power diode readings, then each different control plasma, even for constant diode readings, 

would produce a different water bath signal.  Thus, the nearly identical heat signals measured 

for  the  many  control  plasmas  demonstrate  the  reliability  of  the  power  diodes,  set  at  constant 

readings, as a means to create identical net power input from the magnetron to each plasma.  It 

should  also  be  noted  that  each  plasma  required  unique  'stub  tuning'  to  produce  the  desired 

forward and reflected power readings.  Thus, it is clear that 'tuning' also does not impact the 

readings of the power diodes. 

 

Thorough  tests  were  conducted  to  demonstrate  that  the  magnetron  only  broadcasts 

energy at a single frequency in order to demonstrate that the diode methodology for measuring 

forward power is consistent for all plasmas, both control and RT, studied.  That is, if for RT 

plasmas  some  form  of  “feedback’  corrupts  the  output  of  the  magnetron,  differently  than  for 

control  plasmas,  then  off-resonance  frequency  energy  may  enter  the  plasma  for  RT  plasmas 

only  and  not  be  “registered”  by  the  power  diodes.    To  determine  if  off-frequency 

electromagnetic  emission  existed  for  any  of  the  plasmas,  spectral  measurements  were 

conducted for all of the control and all of the noble gas/hydrogen (RT) plasmas over the full 

frequency range of the spectral analyzer (0-10 GHz) and over the relevant range of forward (60 

+/- 20 W) and reflected (up to 20 W) powers of the microwave generator.  No signal (e.g. no 

off spectral resonances) except at 2455 MHz was detected over this range.   

Detailed  analysis  was  then  conducted  within  +/-  10  MHz  of  the  resonant  frequency,  2455 

MHz.    In  all  cases  the  shape  of  the  resonant  peak  was  the  same  and  no  abnormal  emissions 

were detected. 

 

The  above  analysis  was  done  using  a  6-turn  Ni  wire  coil  antenna  symmetrically 

wrapped  around  the  outside  of  the  plasma  tube,  centered  on  the  Evenson  cell.  The  power 

12 

spectrum of the microwave power driving the plasmas was analyzed using an Advantest R3265 

spectrum  analyzer.    The  power  spectrum  into  all  plasmas  under  the  identical  operating 

conditions as the calorimetric studies was determined to be a single peak at 2455 MHz with a 

full-width-half-maximum  of  1  MHz.    The  relative  input  power  at  different diode settings for 

the  forward  and  reflected  power  was  determined  by  calibrating  the  peak  height  relative  to  a 

microwave power meter.  The power diodes were determined to respond linearly over a broad 

range of forward and reflected powers (+/- 20 W) around the particular absolutely calibrated 

diode readings that were matched in each experiment.  Thus, slight mismatches (on the order 

of +/-1 W) were determined to be inconsequential to the results.  Given the high quality of the 

magnetron and associated control equipment this result is not surprising. 

III.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

 

 

The results of this study clearly show that the heat generated by RT plasmas (

2H/He

, 

2H/Ar

, 

( )gOH 2

) was greater than that generated by non RT plasmas ( He ,  Ar ,  Kr , 

2H/Kr

, 

Xe , 

2H/Xe

, 

2N , 

2 H/N

2

, 

2CO , 

CO

2 H/

2

)  for  the  same  plasma  system  operating 

parameters as shown in Table I for 500 mTorr plasmas and Table II for 200 mTorr plasmas.  

The nominal values to which all the test plasmas could be tuned was 70 +/-2 W forward, 16 +/-

2 W reflected.  The calorimetrically measured power dissipated in the control plasmas matched 

37.5 +/- 2.5 W in all cases as shown for some representative results given in Tables I and II.  

The  range  of  readings  for  the  non  RT  plasmas  of    +/-  2.5  W  probably  does  not  reflect  any 

systematic  differences  between  control  plasmas,  as  even  repeated  measures  of  one  gas  ( Kr ) 

produced  a  similar  range  of  variation  (see  statistical  analysis  below).    The  2.5  W  variation 

13 

probably reflects the true net uncertainty in the experiments.  From these results, power input 

to each RT plasma (

2H/He

,  Ar / H2 , 

( )gOH 2

) was confidently known as the diode readings 

identically matched those of the controls.  That is, there is no reason to believe that the power 

input into the RT plasmas is any different than that input to the ten different 'control' plasmas.  

 

The results of the 1Torr RT plasmas are given in Table I.  A representative result for 

the  absolute  calibration  of  the  input  power  with  a  Kr   plasma  and  the  higher  output  power 

observed  with  a 

2H/He

(10%)  RT  plasma  is  shown  in  Figure  4.    There  is  remarkable 

consistency in the findings:  500 mTorr RT plasmas consistently produced between 55 and 60 

W in the water bath.  Only the 

2H/He

(5%) plasmas were slightly lower (approx. 47 W). With 

an  uncertainty  of  +/-  2.5  W,  it  is  clear  that  the  consistent  difference  in output power (20 W, 

>50%)  between  RT  and  control  plasmas  is  far  outside  the  range  of  either  theoretical  or 

measured error ranges (see statistical analysis below).   

  

In companion studies of water plasmas generated with an identical Evenson cavity in a 

matched  quartz  tube,  it  was  found  that  the  discharge  length  for  200  mTorr  plasmas  is  about 

double  that  found  at  500  mTorr.    Thus,  we  decided  to  test  the  heat  output  from  200  mTorr 

water plasmas.  That is, a longer discharge implies a longer period for 'chemical RT processes' 

to occur, hence generation of additional heat.  As shown in Table II and Figure 5 this increased 

the average water plasma heat output to more than 60 W repeatedly.  In contrast, Kr plasmas 

run  at  this  pressure  produced  heat  output  in  the  same  range  as  all  the  500  mTorr  control 

plasmas.  

 

The net input power of 54 W given by taking the difference of the diode readings of the 

forward and reflected powers shown in Table I is of no particular significance.  These diodes 

were only single-point calibrated at the manufacturer and may not have been accurate.  And, 

14 

even  with  calibration  in  a  water  bath  calorimeter,  they  are  only  absolute  in  the  absence  of  a 

high reflected microwave power.  It is clear, however, that leaving the settings constant even in 

the  presence  of  a  high  reflected  wave  as  in  our  case  should  result  in  a  consistent  supply  of 

power to the plasma. The readings of these diodes should then be interpreted as indicating a 

fixed input condition rather than representing the absolute net power delivered.  Indeed water 

bath calorimetry is an absolute standard and indicates 37.5 +/- 2.5 W input power at the diode 

settings 70 W forward and 16 W reflected.  Clearly, for the wide range of control gases and 

control  gas  mixtures  studied,  the  diode  readings  were  not  influenced  by  the  plasma  gas 

composition, or even the pressure.  That is, for all the control gas combinations, 35 to 40 W 

was measured as the input power to the water bath; whereas, for the RT plasmas an average of 

about 50% more thermal power was observed.   

 

Furthermore, given a mass flow rate of 10 sccm, the energy balance corresponding to 

the  excess  power  of  the  RT  plasmas  was  very  high.  Since the total gas flow rate was about 

7.5 X 10 −6  moles / s   and  the  excess  power  averaged  about  20  W,  the  average  'excess'  energy 

was    3 X 10 4  kJ / mole gas   (or  approx.  150  eV/hydrogen  atom),  compared  to  the  energy  of 

combustion  of  hydrogen  of  −241.8 kJ / mole H2 .    Moreover,  the  only  known  exothermic 

chemistry for the gases and gas mixtures of this study is for some of the controls.  The enthalpy

is 

negligible,  about  0.1  W.    The  very  large  energy  'excess'  observed  with  the  RT  plasmas 

comprising  a  catalyst  and  atomic  hydrogen  were  consistent  with  the  formation  of  fractional 

Rydberg states of atomic hydrogen.   

 

Even though the energy production rate data (either table) for the non-RT plasmas 

and the RT plasmas does not overlap, a thorough statistical analysis was performed. 

Standard one-sided t-tests of the null hypothesis, that the means are equal vs. the 

alternative hypothesis that the RT data is greater than the non-RT data, were carried out.   

In both cases, the test clearly rejects the null hypothesis that the means are equal.  The 

test assumes equal variances, which may not be true for the Table 1 data because of the 

two aberrant observations for He/H2 (5%) plasmas.   

However, because the data don't even overlap, an alternative Wilcoxon 

nonparametric test based on the ranks of the observations in the two groups would also 

clearly reject the null hypothesis.  (Probability of obtaining Wilcoxon statistic as large as 

the calculated value is .003 for Table 1 and 1.1e-6 for Table 2.  That is, the probability 

that the two data sets are actually equivalent is less than one third of one percent.) 

For Table 1, the mean of the control plamas (non-RT) power values is 37.9, 

whereas the mean of the RT plasma power values is 56.6. The t-statistic for the above t-

test is 16.8 with 32 degrees of freedom and a p-value of zero (to several decimal places).  

That is, the probability that a t-statistic at least this large would be obtained if the means 

were actually equal, is extremely small.  The estimated difference in the means is 18.7, 

with a 95% one-sided lower confidence bound of 16.8. 

For Table 2, the mean of the controls (non-RT) power values is 38.8, and the 

mean of the RT  power values is 62.7.  The t-statistic for the above t-test is 15.1 with 9 

16 

degrees of freedom and a p-value of 5.3e-8.  Clearly, the probability that a t-statistic at 

least this large would be obtained if the means of the two data sets were really equivalent 

is virtually zero.  The estimated difference in the means is, 23.9, with a 95% one-sided 

lower confidence bound of 21.0. 

IV.  CONCLUSIONS 

 

 

 

This  study  was  carried  out  to  further  test  the  Mills’  hypothesis  of  heat  production  in 

plasmas  satisfying  the  resonant  transfer  (RT)  criteria.  In  appropriate  RT  plasmas  hydrogen 

electrons will fall into fractional quantum states due to catalytic reactions between hydrogen 

atoms and a catalyst.  This will result in the generation of a significant amount of energy.  The 

results  of  our  study  were  shown  to  be  consistent  with  the  Mills’  hypothesis  but  it  should  be 

fully understood that these results do not establish the correctness of the new Mills theory.  

Specifically, water bath calorimetry studies showed that low pressure RT microwave-

plasmas  generated  with  an  Evenson  cavity  consistently  produced  on  the  order  of  50%  more 

heat than non RT plasmas run under identical conditions, although the only difference between 

the  RT  and  non  RT  plasmas  was  the  identity  of  the  gases.    Furthermore,  the  corresponding 

excess power density of RT plasmas was high, of the order of 

cmW 10
⋅

−

3

. 

 

The  incentive  for  carrying  out  the  study,  and  the  design  (e.g.  use  of  low  pressure 

Evenson cavity generated plasmas) were based on the surprisingly strong support for the Mills 

hypotheses provided by several spectroscopic tests.  Those very rigorous tests produced results 

consistent with the Mills model, but having no satisfactory explanation in standard QM theory.  

In particular, previous spectroscopic investigations demonstrated that low pressure RT plasmas 

17 

generated  with  Evenson  microwave  cavities  have  many  of  the  spectral  features  (e.g.  specific 

spectral  lines  in  the  VUV  region)  predicted  by  the  Mills  model  [5-7,  10-12].    The  present  work 

represents  the  first  thorough  test  of  a  non-spectral  characteristic  of  RT  plasmas,  heat 

production.  

 

The  authors  can  find  no  satisfactory  conventional  physics  explanation  for  the 

experimental  results  reported  herein.    That  is,  it  is  not  clear  what  special  feature  of  the  RT 

plasmas gases could cause more power to be generated and subsequently cause the water bath 

to  heat  up  at  a  rate  more  than  50%  greater  than  matched  controls.    The  standard  model  of 

microwave  plasmas  allows  only  for  electrons  to  absorb  power  from  the  microwave  field.    In 

turn,  this  absorbed  energy  is  partially  converted  by  various  mechanisms  into  electron 

excitation,  vibration,  rotation,  and  translation  of  the  various  atomic  and  molecular  species 

present.    All  the  energy  initially  absorbed  by  the  electrons  from  the  microwave  field  is 

eventually transferred to the water in the bath.  Moreover, the reliability of the power diodes as 

a  means  to  determine  input  power  is  attested  to  by  the  remarkable  similarity  of  water  bath 

behavior  for  more  than  10  different  control  plasmas,  each  presumably  with  a  distinct  EEDF, 

radical  population  and  even  gas  temperature  profile.    Each  control  plasma  required  a  unique 

'tuning' of the two stubs to obtain the desired forward and reflected power readings.  That is, 

the 'reflectivity' of the plasma did not disturb the net input power determination of the power 

diodes.  

 

There is no known chemistry possible in a 

2H/He

,  Ar , or water vapor plasma known 

to the authors that would yield the significant 'excess' power observed.  There is no standard 

physics  explanation  for  the  finding  that  extra  heat is associated only with those plasmas that 

produce dramatic Balmer series line broadening [5-6, 14-17], inversion of the population of excited 

18 

states [14, 28], and specific spectral lines in the EUV region [5-7, 10-12].  In contrast, these findings 

are consistent with the Mills model predictions that RT plasmas will generate heat, in addition 

to  that  absorbed  by  electrons  from  the  microwave  field,  through  the  catalytic  reaction  with 

atomic hydrogen that cause electrons in hydrogen atoms in RT plasmas to transition to states 

with fractional quantum numbers.  

 

It bears repeating that the results of this study do not 'prove' the correctness of the new 

Mills model of QM.  Still, the scientific method requires that a theory that correctly predicts 

multiple outcomes must be seriously considered.  Further testing by the scientific community 

for  ‘excess  heat’  and  other  phenomena  associated  with  the  new  Mills’  theory  is  clearly 

warranted.  One possible test suggests itself immediately:  collect the 'gas' product of the RT 

plasmas and test it for unusual spectroscopic, NMR and other features.

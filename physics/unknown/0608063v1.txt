Abstract: In this paper, we first discuss the origin of preferential attachment. Then we establish 

the generalized  preferential attachment  which  has two new  properties;  first,  it  encapsulates  both 

the  topological  and  weight  aspects  of  a  network,  which  makes  it  is  neither  entirely  degree 

preferential  nor  entirely  weight preferential.  Second,  it can tell us  not  only  the chance that each 

already-existing  vertex  being  connected  but  also  how  much  weight  each  new  edge  has.  The 

generalized  preferential  attachment  can  generate  four  power-law  distributions,  besides  the  three 

for vertex degrees, vertex strengths, and edge weights, it yield a new power-law distribution for 

the subgraph degrees.

Many  systems  in  the  world  can  be  described  as  complex  networks, which  are  structures  of 

vertices and edges. For examples, the protein networks [1], the WWW web [2], and the scientific 

collaboration networks [3,4]. In the past few years, complex networks have been widely studied 

by  scientists  form  various  areas  [5-7],  and  many  properties  of  complex  networks,  such  as  the 

small-world  character  [8]  and  the  scale-free  behavior  [9],  have  been  revealed.  The  small-world 

networks, introduced by Watts and Strogatz, are a kind of networks between the two extreme cases; 

regular lattices and random graphs. Specifically, they have high clustering coefficients like regular

lattices, yet have short average path lengths like random graphs. Besides the small-world character, 

the scale-free behavior is another property, which refers to the fact that many large networks show 

power-law  degree  distributions

kP

~)(

γ−k

,  where 

( )P k

  is  defined  as  the  probability  that  a 

randomly  selected  vertex  has  exactly 

  edges.  And  it  is  believed  that  the  degree  preferential 

k

attachment  mechanism, introduced by Barabási and Albert, is an effective method of generating 

the scale-free property [5]. 

This  degree  preferential  attachment  (DPA)  was  also  applied  to  the  study  of  weighted 

networks  [10-12],  in  which  the  strength  of  the  interactions  between  vertices  is  considered.  And 

subsequently,  the  weight  preferential  attachment  (WPA)  was  brought  forward  [10,13,14].  These 

two  kinds  of  preferential  attachments  focus  on  different  sorts  of  network  properties.  The  DPA 

focus on the degree or the topological aspect of a network, defined as 

→∏

new i

=

.                                                          (1) 

Namely, the probability 

new i→∏

  of an already-existing vertex 

  being chosen for connecting is 

i

proportional to its degree 

. On the other hand, WPA focus on the weight aspect, defined as 

ik

→∏

new i

=

.                                                        (2) 

That is, the probability 

new i→∏

  of an already-existing vertex 

  being chosen for connecting is 

i

proportional  to  its  strength 

.  The  strength 

is

is

  of  vertex  i   is  defined  as 

s

w

j

j N i
( )

where 

j   runs  over  the  neighbors 

( )N i

  of  vertex  i   [10]  and 

  is  the  weight  of  the  edge

connecting  vertices 

i

  and 

j ,  which  characterize  the  interaction  strength  between  i   and  j . 

Typical  definition  of

These  two  kinds  of  preferential  attachment  could  be  regarded  as  two  extreme  cases.  And 

when  scientists  modeling  weighted  evolving  networks,  they  often  chose  one  of  them,  either  the 

DPA [10-12] or the WPA [10,13,14]. However, just as real-world networks are neither completely 

regular  nor  completely  random,  real-world  preferential  attachment  should  be  neither  entirely 

degree preferential nor entirely weight preferential. We should consult both topological aspect and 

weight aspect into one preferential attachment. Besides, these two kinds of preferential attachment 

can only tell us which vertices are likely to be selected. They can’t tell us what weights the new 

edges  are.  Thus,  when  scientists  study  the  weighted  evolving  networks,  they  often  use  other 

mechanism  to  assign  weight.  For  examples,  when  an  already-existing  vertex 

  is  chosen  for 

i

connecting by a new edge, the weight of the new edge is determined by the degree of 

i

  [10], or 

fixed to a constant when they first appear (but will change later)[13]. We argue that a preferential 

attachment used in weighted evolving network models should tell us not only which vertices are 

likely to be selected, but also what weights the new edges are. In the following part of this paper, 

we  will  first  survey the origin  of preferential  attachment, and then  we  will  raise  the  generalized 

preferential attachments (GPA) which satisfy these two requirements. And finally, we will study 

the statistical properties of the generated networks.

Fig. 1. A vertex  i   in (a) with degree 

ik   can be treated as a crowd of 

ik   vertices, 

as seen in (b), the circle means that the vertices inside belong to the same crowd, 
and each vertex in crowd has only one edge. 

 

 

When we use the DPA, two vertices are equivalent, that is, have the same chance of being 

chosen for connecting, when they have the same degree. But when we use the WPA, two vertices 

are equivalent iff they have the same strength. This concept, the equivalence of two vertices, plays 

a key role in the evolving of a network. On the one hand, as mentioned above, each preferential 

attachment corresponds to one kind of vertex equivalence. On the other hand, this concept is more 

essential.  From  a  definition  of  vertex  equivalence  and  some  basic  hypothesis  of  statistical 

mechanics, we can deduce a preferential attachment. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 1(a), suppose 

in this network, two vertices are equivalent when they have the same degree. We are now going to 

choose  one  from  the  six  already-existing  vertices,  so  what  is  the  chance  of  each  vertex  being 

selected?  Assume  the  network  is  a  non-interaction  system,  in  which  vertices  keep  their 

probabilities  of  being  selected  no  matter  how  near  they  are  (even  two  vertices  overlap).  Due  to 

this assumption, a vertex 

i

  with 

ik

  edges can be considered as the overlapping of a crowd of 

4

vertices 

ji   (

j

=

1, 2,

,
⋅⋅⋅

k

i

), in which each vertex has only one edge, as seen in Figs. 1 (b). Thus, 

vertex 

i

  has the same chance of being selected as the corresponding vertex crowd; here a vertex 

crowd  being  selected  means  any  of  its  vertex 

ji   (

j

=

1, 2,

,
⋅⋅⋅

k

i

)  being  selected.  Since  we’ve 

define “two vertices equivalent when they have the same degree”, all vertices in Figs. 1(b) have 

equal chances to be selected, because each of them has only one edge. Therefore, the probability 

new i→∏

  of vertex 

  being chosen is proportional to the number of vertices in the corresponding 

i

crowd, namely, 

→∏

new i

∝

ik

. So we get DPA from “two vertices are equivalent when they have 

the same degree”. Analogously, if two vertices are equivalent when they have the same strength, 

we will get WPA, 

→∏

new i

∝

is

. We can also define two vertices equivalent when they have both 

the  same  degree and  weight,  this time  the  preferential  attachment  will  be

, 

where 

1a

  and 

2a

  are  the  coefficients  of  proportionality  which  evaluate  the  importance  of 

degrees and strengths, respectively. 

Since  we  want  a  preferential  attachment  to  include  both  the  topological  aspect  and  weight 

aspects,  naturally  we  can  define  two  vertices  equivalent  when  they  have  the  same  degree  and 

weight  But  these  two  values,  degree  and  strength,  are  insufficient  to  describe  a  vertex 

comprehensively in a weighted network. Two vertices with the same degree and strength can still 

be  quite  different.  We  can  easily  tell  a  vertex  with  eight  edges  whose  edge  weight  is  6,  from 

another vertex who has also eight edges but four edges with weight 2, while the other four with 

weight 10, thought these two vertices have the same degree and weight. To solve this problem, we 

introduce  the  degree  distribution  of  a  vertex  (it  is  different  from  the  degree  distribution  of  a 

network). The degree distribution of a vertex 

  points out the number of edges connecting to 

i

i

 

with  edge  weight  between 

w

  and 

w

w+ Δ .  Specifically,  we  divide  the  range  of  edge  weight

Equally important, we hope the GPA can tell us how much weight each new edge is going to have.

In  the  following  we  will  study  one  simple  but  useful  case  that

Remember that 

jla   is a coefficient that evaluates how much the 

l

th subgraph contributes to the 

chance  that vertex 

  gets  a new  edge and  the edge  weight  is 

i

jw .  Equation  (8)  separates these 

two aspects: how much the 

th subgraph contributes to the chance that a vertex being selected, 

which  is  proportional  to

jw ,  which  is 

proportional to 

jc . We can see the latter aspect much clearer if we substituting equation (8) into 

l

(7), which gives

We will use this equation in the following part. 

We  can  solve  this  case  analytically  by  continuous  approximation  [5].  Assume  that  the

Further  more,  for  mimicking  real  systems.  We  assume  that  for  l

p≤ , 

ld

l=

,  but  when 

l

p>

, 

ld

  drops  linearly  from 

p   to  unity,  namely, 

− = −

(1

p

p l
)(

−

p

) /(

n

−

p

)

,  where 

ld

p

n∈
[1, ]

  is  a  integer  and 

  is  the  number  of  subgraphs  we  divide  the  network  into.  This 

n

assumption  indicates  that  when  the  edge  weight  is  not  too  large,  the  contribution  of  an  edge 

increases as its weight increases. But when the edge weight is over a threshold, which is governed 

 

 

14

by parameter  p , the more weight the edge is, the less it contributes. For instance, when 

1p = , 

all edges contribute the same, this is the case in degree preferential attachment. When  p

n= , the 

contribution is proportional to the edge weight all the time, so we turn to the weight preferential 

attachment.  Then,  we  assume 

  has  a  power-law  form 

jc

jc

j ζ−=

,  where  ζ   is  a  positive 

number.  That  is,  the  likelihood  that  the  new  edge  weight  is 

jw   decreases  rapidly  as 

jw  

increases.  Yet,  in  this  paper,  we  will  study  the  simplest  case  of  the  initial  attractiveness

L

,  in  which  all  elements  have  the  same  value,

b= ,  for 

j

1, 2,

,

n

. 

When 

b =

0

,  equation  (16)  gives 

3γ = ,  which  is  independent  from  p ,  ζ ,  and 

m

.  That 

means when there is no initial attractiveness, no matter we use the degree preferential attachment 

(

1p = ),  or  the  weight  preferential  attachment  ( p

n= ),  or  others,  the  model  yields  power  law 

distributions  of  degree  (including  total  degree  and  degree  in  each  subgraph)  and  strength  with 

exponents  equals  exactly  to  three.  This  result  is  confirmed  by  numerical  simulations,  as  seen  in 

Fig. 2. When 

b ≠

0

, the model also yields power law distributions for large 

k

  and 

s

. But this 

time, just as equation (16) indicates, the exponents depend on what kind of preferential attachment 

we choose. This is also observed in numerical results, see Fig.3. On the other hand, according to 

equation  (19),  since  we  assume 

  has  a  power-law  form 

,  the  distribution  of  single

  with the same exponent 

as  that  of 

,  and  independent  from 

p , 

m

  and  b .  This  result  is  confirmed  by  numerical 

jc

simulations too, as seen in Fig. 4.

averaged over 10 independent runs of size 

N =

. 

In  conclusion,  the  division  of  edge-weight  range  discretizes  one  weighted  network  into 

several  unweighted  subgraphs.  And  with  a  proper  definition  of  equivalence  of  two  vertices,  we 

can  get  one  preferential  attachment  which  accurately  reflects  the  contribution  of  each  subgraph. 

The generalized preferential attachment can tell us not only the chance that each already-existing 

vertex  being  connected  but  also  how  much  weight  each  new  edge  has.  And  by  using  this 

preferential  attachment  we  can  generate  a  network  which  displays  power-law  distributions  of 

degree, strength, and single edge weight.

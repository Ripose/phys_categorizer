Peculiar light-matter interactions can break the rule that a single beam polarization can address 

only  two  states  in  an  optical  memory  device.  Multistate  storage  of  a  single  beam  polarization  is 

achieved  using  self-induced  surface  diffraction  gratings  in  a  photo-active  polymer  material.  The 

grating  orientation  follows  the  incident  light  beam  polarization  direction.  The  permanent  self-

induced surface relief grating can be readout in real time using the same laser beam.

Multistate polarization addressing using one single beam in an azo polymer film

Owing  to  the  fact  that  photon  possesses  a  polarization  angular  momentum  of  one,  it  is  well 

admitted that one single beam polarization can address only two states in an optical memory device. 

Indeed,  use  of  a  polarized  light  can  in  principle  only  double  the  storage  capacity  of  digital  or 

holographic optical memory devices [1]. We show in the following that peculiar material properties 

can break this principle. 

Properties  of  polymers  containing  photochromic  azo  dyes  have  received  tremendous  attention 

owing  to  the  possibility  of  optically  addressed  birefringence  and  dichroism  [2,  3].  This  led  to  the 

investigation  of  the  holographic  optical  storage  properties  of  azo  polymers  [4].  It  is  now  well-

established  that  following  light  excitation  whose  wavelength  lies  in  the  absorption  band,  cis-trans 

isomerization  takes  place,  leading  to  further  thermal  orientation  diffusion  which  enables  a 

molecular rotation within the polymer matrix. This finally leads to  a full reorientation of the azo-

dye  molecules  [5,  6].  More  recent  results  showed  that  surface  relief  gratings  (SRG)  were  also 

induced  further  to  the  photo-excitation  of  azo-polymer  films  [4,  7].  Photoinduced  SRG  were 

interpreted  as  a  consequence  of  molecular  translation  controlled  by  the  optical  field  [8].  An 

interference pattern of coherent light beams was used  for irradiation of the materials and the  film 

surface  modification  was  controlled  by  the  light  interference  pattern  [9].  Two  beams  are  usually 

necessary  but  it  was  also  recently  demonstrated  that  a  single  beam  interaction  can  induce  well 

ordered structures [10]. 

In  the  same  time,  the  increase  of  information  storage  needs  in  information  science  and 

technology lead to significant efforts in order to increase the capacity of storage media. Holographic 

memories  are  promising  candidates  in  this  respect  because  they  permit  3-dimensional  optical 

information storage [11]. In this case, coding is done by the mixing of two coherent laser beams: an 

object and a reference one. The angular selective property of holograms recorded in thick materials 

enables high density data storage. Two beams are usually necessary. Photorefractive materials are 

attractive for hologram recording, but they are weakly sensitive to the intensity distribution of the 

recording beam and require 2 beams for a multidimensional addressing [12]. 

In  this  study  we  demonstrate  that  multistate  storage  of  a  single  beam  polarization  can  be 

achieved  and  readout  in  a  polymer  material.  Our  original  technique  uses  only  one  beam  with 

controlled polarization in order to photoinduce a SRG whose wave-vector direction depends on the 

light polarization. The trial material used in this study is an efficient azo-polymer derivative [13].

SRG  are  produced  in  a  one  step  irradiation  process  in  standard  laboratory  conditions.  Our 

characterization  method  for  photoinduced  SRG  consists  in  diffraction  studies  and  atomic  force 

microscopy (AFM). Our observations open the door to multistate optical information storage using 

polarization encoding. 

The  samples  are  polymer  films  made  from  a  highly  photoactive  azobenzene  derivative 

containing heterocyclic sulfonamide moieties: 3-[{4-[(E)-(4-{[(2,6-dimethylpyrimidin-4-yl) amino] 

sulfonyl}phenyl)  diazenyl]phenyl}-(methyl)amino]propyl  2-methylacrylate  [14].  Thin  films  on 

glass  substrates  were  prepared  by  spin-coating  of  the  polymer  from  THF  solutions  with  a 

concentration of 50 mg/ml. Thickness measured with a Dektak-6M Stylus Profiler was around 1µm. 

Absorbance at λ = 438 nm maximum is 1.9 The λ = 476.5 nm laser line of a continuous argon ion 

laser is used to excite the azo polymer absorption close to its absorption maximum. Absorbance at 

working wavelength is 1.6. Incoming light intensity is controlled by the power supply. Polarization 

direction  of  the  laser  beam  is  varied  using  a  half-wave  plate.  Sample  is  set  perpendicular  to  the 

incident  laser  beam.  The  size  of  the  collimated  laser  beam  impinging  onto  the  polymer  sample  is 

controlled with a Kepler-type afocal system. Sample is irradiated with different polarizations using 
different laser beam intensities with a defect beam size of 4 mm diameter at 1/e2. 

In  a  preliminary  experiment  we  carefully  checked  that  laser  irradiation  leads  to  a  topographic 

modification  of  the  polymer  surface  resulting  in  a  SRG.  When  the  surface  relief  is  formed,  the 

impinging beam itself is diffracted in several diffraction orders. We show in figure 1 the intensity 

for  first  order  self-diffraction  recorded  as  a  function  of  time  for  different  laser  beam  intensities. 

Self-diffraction which occurs in both forward and backward directions is collected in the backward 

direction by a f = 200 mm focal-length lens and registered as a function of time by a photodiode. 
Above  760  mW/cm2  input  beam  intensity,  the  polymer  film  could  be  damaged  and  we  did  not 

exceed  this  limit.  The  self-diffraction  phenomenon  exhibits  a  threshold  depending  on  the  power 

density. We define a threshold time for the induction of self-diffraction as the inflexion point of the 

curve, when second derivative changes sign. The threshold is linear as a function of the input beam 
intensity and its slope is estimated at about 33 mW/cm2.min-1. We checked that this threshold does 

not  depend  on  polarization.  Measurements  using  different  beam  sizes  between  3  and  6  mm 

confirmed also that the threshold time is a function of power density only. For a same laser intensity 

but with a smaller beam size, threshold time decreases. 

We then controlled at a microscopic level the grating formation as a function of time (fig. 2). In 

order to get information on the surface relief evolution during the recording period, we have printed 
different gratings on the same sample during different times with a laser intensity of 450 mW/cm2.

Both the height and the pitch of the grating were retrieved as a function of time with a contact-mode 

AFM. Insert in figure 2 presents the first order self-diffraction intensity as a function of time up to 

the saturation intensity at which a stable and permanent grating is printed. All results in figure 2, for 
a 450 mW/cm2 intensity, either  for the  grating’s  height or pitch and diffraction show a threshold-

like evolution with inflexion around 20 min.  

 

Figure  3  (a-d)  shows  AFM  images  of  permanent  structures  induced  with  four  different 

polarizations of the input laser beam: at 0°, 30°, 60° and 90° with respect to the initial polarization. 
Laser beam intensity  was 450 mW/cm2. Growth  time for these  gratings  was 1h.  It corresponds to 

the  first  order  diffracted  beam  intensity  reaching  a  maximum.  AFM  measurements  retrieve  angle 

values which are in a good agreement with the input polarization direction. Surface gratings have a 

depth  of  50  nm  ±  5  nm,  whatever  the  polarization  used.  Grating  pitch  is  Λ  =  800  nm  ±  30  nm, 

which  is  in  agreement  with  the  value  given  by  second    order  diffraction  theory  in  the  θ  =  32.6° 

direction: Λ  =  2  λ  /  2  sin  θ.  Figure  3  (e-h)  shows  camera  pictures  of  the  self-diffracted  beam  for 

each polarization angle. Measurements using different beam sizes between 3 and 6 mm confirmed 

that the time to reach a permanent grating is a function of power density only.  

The mechanism proposed to explain the origin of the driving force responsible for SRG formation 

was  partly  disclosed  earlier  [15].  It  results  from  isomerization  induced  translation  in  which  the 

molecules migrate almost parallel to the polarization direction [8]. In particular, when a collimated 

laser beam with intensity I impinges onto the sample, light is diffused inside the polymer film in all 

directions around any micro-roughness [15]. Let’s call h the height of a particular roughness. It will 
diffract  a  light  amplitude  u  into  the  film  plane  with  u ∝  hA  where  A  =  I½  is  the  laser  amplitude. 

According to [8], the rate of growth of the roughness is ∂h/ ∂t ∝ u+• u- where u+ and u- stand for two 

counter propagating coherent waves interfering into the polymer film plane. So, roughness height h 

increases  with  time  t  from  its  initial  value  h0  as  h(t)  ≈  h0  /  (1-  b  I  t  h0),  up  to  saturation  of  the 

diffraction  efficiency  owing  to  coupled  wave  theory  [16].  Coefficient  b  is  related  to  the  quantum 

efficiency of the photoinduced translation and surface relief growth process [8]. The process which 

initially diverges as b I t h0 tends to 1 saturates and tends to a limit height hmax for which more light 

coupled  by  diffraction  into  the  polymer  film  results  into  more  light  diffracted  out  of  the  polymer 

film. A balance is then obtained when incident and diffracted beams reach comparable magnitudes 

(backward up-diffracted intensity reaches experimentally 1 %). 

When  the  grating  has  been  stored  permanently,  the  self-induced  SRG  can  be  retrieved  using  the 

same beam as the one used to write the grating. Before saturation of the SRG (t < 20 min in fig.2),

the process is reversible and diffraction can be addressed in several direction using the writing beam 

polarization.  This  shows  on  one  side  that the  fundamental  process  of  SRG  inscription  in  our  azo-

polymer  is  reversible.  This  shows  on  an  other  side  that  several  diffraction  directions  can  be 

controlled  using  one  single  beam  polarization  direction.  The  minimum  number  of  diffraction 

directions which can be resolved without overlapping is limited by the lateral size of the first order 

spots in the Fourier transform of the SRG in figure 3-left. This Fourier transform is exactly given by 

the  diffraction  pattern  shown  in  figure  3-right.  This  practically  results  in  a  divergence  of  the 

diffracted beam: α = 22.6°. If we detect the diffracted beam at a distance D from the polymer film, 

the spot diameter is: 

d =

2

. So, the maximum number of states N that can be encoded and

where  S  is  the  perimeter  of  the  circle  made  by  the  diffraction  angle  in  the  detection  plane.  The 

factor 2 in the denominator accounts for negative and positive diffraction orders. We find N = 4 in 

our particular example. 

We  have  demonstrated  for  the  first  time  that  multistate  addressing  by  polarization  could  be 

achieved  using  one  single  beam  polarization  into  an  azo-polymer  film.  The  different  polarization 

states  are  stored  as  surface  diffraction  gratings.  Grating  orientation  follows  the  incident  beam 

polarization direction. The permanent SRG readout by a single beam diffracts light into positive and 

negative  diffraction  orders  in  the  backward  and  forward  directions  along  the  incident  beam 

polarization  direction.  We  are  currently  developing  faster  materials  in  order  to  find  realistic 

applications of our principles in optical processing devices.

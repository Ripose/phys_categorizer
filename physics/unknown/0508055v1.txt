Abstract:  This  paper  studies  the  relations  between  agent  performance  and  their  intellective 
abilities  in  mix-game  in  which  there  are  two  groups  of  agents:  each  group  has  different 
memory length and different time horizon, and one group plays minority game the other plays 
majority game. It is found that these relations are greatly influenced by the configurations of 
memory lengths of the two groups. 
 
Keywords: minority game, mix-game, agent performance, intellective ability

Introduction:   

 

Challet and Zhang's MG model, together with the original bar model of Arthur [1], attracts 

a lot of following studies. Given the MG's richness and yet underlying simplicity, the MG has 

also received much attention as a financial market model [2~6]. C. Gou proposed an extended 

model of MG-----mix-game in which there are two groups of agents: each group has different 

memory length and different time horizon, and one group plays minority game the other plays 

majority game [9, 10]. Among a lot of articles which studied MG or its extensions, only a few 

papers looked at the relations of the relation between agent performances and their intellective 

abilities. Challet and Zhang [7] and Johnson etc. [8] studied mixed-population MG in which 

agents have either smaller memory length or bigger memory length and they found that agents 

with bigger “brain”, that is agents have bigger memory length, have advantage to profit from 

agents with smaller “brain”. This paper addresses this issue by looking at agents’ performance 

in mix-game under different configurations of memory lengths of agents. For comparison, it 

also  studies  agent  performance  vs.  memory  length  in  pure-population  MG.  In  section  2,  I 

describe  the  model  and  the  simulation  conditions.  In  section  3,  the  simulation  results  and 

discussion are presented. In section 4, the conclusion is reached.     

2. 

the model and Simulation conditions 

The MG comprises an odd number of agents N choosing repeatedly between the options of 

buying (1) and selling (0) a quantity of a risky asset. The agents continually try to make the 

minority decision i.e. buy assets when the majority of other agents are selling and sell when 

the  majority  of  other  agents are  buying.  Mix-game  model  is  an  extension  of  minority  game 

(MG) so its structure is similar to MG. In mix-game, there are two groups of agents; group1 

plays the majority game, and the group2 plays the minority game. N (odd number) is the total 

number of the agents and N1 is number of agents in group1. The system resource is r=N*L, 

where L<1 is the proportion of resource of the system. All agents compete in the system for 

the limited resource r. T1 and T2 are the time horizon lengths of the two groups of agents, and 

m1 and m2 denote the memory lengths of the two groups of agents, respectively.     

The global information only available to the agents is a common bit-string “memory” of the 

m1 or m2 most recent competition outcomes (1 or 0). A strategy consists of a response, i.e., 0 

(sell) or 1 (buy), to each possible bit string; hence there are 

m

122

or 

m

222

  possible strategies 

for group 1 or group 2, respectively, which form full strategy spaces (FSS). At the beginning 

of the game, each agent is assigned s strategies and keeps them unchangeable during the game. 

After each turn, agents assign one (virtual) point to a strategy which would have predicted the 

correct outcome. For agents in group 1, they will reward their strategies one point if they are 

in the majority; for agents in group 2, they will reward their strategies one point if they are in 

the minority. Agents collect the virtual points for their strategies over the time horizon T1 or 

T2, and they use their strategy which has the highest virtual point in each turn. If there are two 

strategies which have the highest virtual point, agents use coin toss to decide which strategy 

to be used. Excess demand is equal to the number of ones (buy) which agents choose minus 

the number of zeros (sell) which agents choose. According to a widely accepted assumption 

that  excess  demand  exerts  a  force  on  the  price  of  the  asset  and  the  change  of  price  is 

proportion to the excess demand in a financial market [11~13], the time series of prices of the 

asset can be calculated based on the time series of excess demand.   

In  simulation,  the  distribution  of  initial  strategies  of  agents  is  randomly  distributed  and 

keeps unchanged during the games. Simulation timesteps are 3000. Total number of agents is 

201. Number of strategies per agent is 2.

Fig.1  show  the  simulation  results  about  average  winnings  per  agent  per  turn  in  MG  and 

mix-game  vs.  different  memory  lengths  under  the  condition  of  N=201,  T1=T2=12  for  MG, 

m1=m2, T1=T2=12, N=201 and N1=72 for mix-game, respectively. The average winning per 

agent per turn of MG (R) has the lowest point at m=3, and increase sharply at m=4. Then R 

increase  slowly  from  m=4  to  m=6  and  remain  stable  for  m>6.  This  implies  that  m=6  for 

agents in MG is the most efficient memory length. 

The  average  winnings  per  agent  per  turn  of  mix-game  (R1  and  R2)  have  lowest  point  at 

m1=m2=1, which is different from that of MG, and they increase greatly at m1=m2=3. After 

m1=m2=5,  R1  and  R2  behave  stable.  Table1  gives  the  quantitatively  calculated  result  of 

correlations among R1, R2 and R. R1, R1 and R are highly positively correlated when agent’s 

memory lengths increase from 1 to 12.

Fig.2  shows  the  average  winnings  per  agent  per  turn  in  mix-game  vs.  different  memory 

length of m1 under the condition of m2=6, T1=T2=12, N=201 and N1=72. From Fig. 2, one 

can  find  that  the  average  winnings  per  agent  per  turn  of  both  groups  (R1  and  R2)  increase 

when  m1  decreases  from  6  to  1  and  R1  increases  much  more  quickly  than  R2.  And  the 

average  winning  of  group  1  (R1)  is  larger  than  that  of  group2  (R2).  R1  and  R2  in  Fig.2 

behave  quite  differently  from  those  in  Fig.1.  Table  2  lists  the  quantitatively  results  of 

correlations among R1, R2 and R. R1 and R2 are highly positively correlated, which is similar 

to that in Fig.1, while correlation between R and R1 or R2 is negative, which is different from 

that in Fig.1. Comparing Fig.2 with Fig.1, one can conclude that agents in both groups largely 

increase  their  average  winnings  under  the  condition  of  m1<m2=6.  This  implies  that  agents 

with smaller memory lengths in group1 can not only improve their own performance but also 

benefit for agents in group2. That is to say, agents in group2 can take advantage of agents in 

group1 if agents in group1 have smaller memory lengths than agents in group2.

Fig.3 presents the average winnings per agent per turn in mix-game vs. different memory 

length of m2 under the condition of m1=6, T1=T2=12, N=201 and N1=72. From Fig.3, one 

can find that the average winning of group1 (R1) behaves relatively stable, while the average 

winning of group2 (R2) decreases when m2 decreases from 6 to 1. The average winning of 

group 1 (R1) is larger than that of group 2 (R2). The most impressive outcome is that R and 

R2 are almost cohesive, which implies that the agents in group1 don’t influence the average 

winnings  of  agents  in  group2  in  this  simulation  condition.  Table  3  gives  the  result  of 

correlation  among  R1,  R2  and  R.  The  correlation  between  R  and  R2  is  nearly  1,  while  the 

correlation between R and R1 is slightly negative. Comparing Fig.3 with Fig.2, one can find 

that the interplay between group1 and group2 is quit different in these two situations. Agents 

in group2 can not take advantage of agents in group1 if agents in group1 have bigger memory 

lengths than agents in group2. Meanwhile, agents in group1 with bigger memory length also 

can not take advantage of agents in group2 which have smaller memory lengths. It is seems 

that there is no interplay between these two groups.   

4.  Conclusion 

The  relations  between  agent  performance  and  their  intellective  abilities  in  mix-game  are 

greatly  influenced  by  the  configurations  of  memory  lengths  of  the  two  groups:  if  these  two 

groups  have  the  same  memory  length,  the  relation  between  agent  performance  and  their 

intellective abilities is similar to that of pure-population MG; if agents in group1 have smaller 

memory length than agents in group2, the performances of both groups improve while agents 

in group1 have smaller and smaller memory length; if agents in group1 have bigger memory 

length than agents in group2, the performances of these two groups do not seem to influence 

each other. This result suggests that the overall performance of the system can be improved 

under the condition of m1<m2=6.

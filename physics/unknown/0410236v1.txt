1.Introduction 

From  the  viewpoint  of  performance  of  nuclear  fusion  plasmas,  pellet  injection 

experiments have been actively carried out in many toroidal devices in the sense of the control 

of density profile, obtaining high density or improved confinement, and diagnostic purposes. In 

order to have a common measure of pellet ablation, the regression study has been performed as 

an international cooperation activity, obtaining “IPAD” (International Pellet Ablation Database) 

[1]. However, these are empirical ones, and the mechanism of pellet ablation still remains to be 

studied.   

According  to  such  database  or  calculations  based  on  the  typical  pellet  ablation  model 

(such as, so-called the neutral gas shielding model), it is known that the penetration depth into 

plasma  is  always  quite  sensitive  to  the  pellet  size.  Also,  an  effective  or  suitable  range  of  the 

pellet size for a certain plasma is generally very narrow, and this range largely varies depending 

to each toroidal plasma size. These typical characteristics are seen in the calculation results for 

the JIPP T-IIU tokamak plasma (Fig.2) and for the TEXTOR plasma (Fig.3). 

Thus, the precise controllability of the pellet size, especially the size controllability with 

continuously variable system will be quite effective in order to carry out the detailed studies on 

pellet ablation and associated phenomena. 

A pellet injector of new type with precisely and continuously controllable system of pellet 

size  has  started  to  be  developed.  This  has  a  unique  mechanics  and  structure  of  producing  a 

frozen  pellet  in  extremely  low  temperature  region.  The  central  part  of  the  pellet  injector  with 

continuously size-variable system is given in Fig.5 (As a comparison, the conventional type is 

shown in Fig.4.). In the device presently developed in this research, we will precisely adjust the 

length  of  the  cylindrical  pellet  (Φ  1.0mm)  from  0.5  to  3mm  by  using  the  special  "length 

limiting rod". 

 

2.Numerical analysis by Neutral-Gas-Shielding (NGS) model 

In pellet injection, in order to obtain optimum injection parameter (size,speed and angle 

etc.), it is necessary to calculate  ablation rate, namely particle deposition for ice pellet. In this 

study  the  numerical  analysis  has  been  carried  out  by  using  the  Neutral-gas-shielding  model  in 

order to estimate the effect of pellet size on the penetration depth and plasma parameters. In this 

the  pellet  passes  the  plasma  without 

Figure 1. Typical of the ablation rate 

ablation  model,  pellet  (neutral)  particles  ablate  with  heat  flux  in  plasma  to  form  the  ablation 

cloud  around the pellet. Then, the cloud shields the pellet from energy flux from plasma. The 

ablation rate (regression speed of the pellet surface)  is expressed as 

where  rpel  is  the  pellet  radius,  ne∞  the  electron  density  in  plasma,  and  Te∞  the  electron 
temperature in plasma.

Figure 1 shows that typical result 

of  the  ablation  rate  in  JIPP  T-ⅡU 

plasma  as    a  function  of  the  pellet 

pass,  where  the  pellet  size  is  varied 

from 0.5 to 3.0 mm. In the area where 

size of the pellet is 1.0mm or less, the 

pellet  completely  ablated  in  plasma. 

On  the  other  hand,  in  the  area  where 

size of the pellet is bigger than 1.0mm, 

completely  ablating.  As  is  seen,  the 

penetration  depth  is  very  sensitive  to 

the  pellet  size.  Figure  2  shows  that 

typical results of the pellet penetration 

depth  in  JIPP  T- Ⅱ U  plasma  as  a 

function  of  the  pellet  velocity,  where 

the  pellet  size  is  varied  from  0.1  to 

1.0mm.  Figure  3  shows  that  typical 

results  of  the  pellet  penetration  depth 

in  TEXTOR  plasma  as  a  function  of 

the  pellet  velocity,  where  the  pellet 

size is varied from 0.5 to 2.0 mm. As 

is   seen, 

the  penetration  is  quite 

sensitive to the pellet size, and also, an 

effective or suitable range of the pellet 

size  for  a  certain  plasma  is  generally 

very  narrow,  and  this  range  largely 

varies  depending  on  each  toroidal 

plasma size.

3. Development of the pellet 

injector with continuously       

size-controllable system 

Figure  4  shows  the  central  part 

of 

the  pellet 

injector  system  of 

conventional type. In the system, since 

pellet size is decided by the thickness 

of the disk, one device can only make 

a pellet of one size. The central part of 

the 

continuously 

size-controllable 

pellet 

injection 

system 

being 

developed  now  is  shown  in  Fig.5.  In 

the device presently developed in this 

research,  we  will  precisely  adjust  the 

length  of 

the  cylindrical  pellet           

(Φ 1.0mm) from 0.5 to 3mm by using 

a 

special 

"length 

limiting 

rod".

Detailed procedure of the pellet injector with continuously size-controllable system (in Fig.5) is 

①  Fill the hydrogen gas line (of part A) with hydrogen gas. 

②  Adjust pellet size by the length limiting rod (of part B). 

③  Form a pellet by cooling (in part C). 

④  Pull out the length limiting rod (of part B). 

⑤  Rotate disk    (of part D) by 180°. 

⑥  Eject a pellet from propellant gas line (of part E). 

The mechanism of the injector with " length limiting rod " has been designed and currently it is 

being tested.

4.Further steps in the development 

The pellet injector system of this research is being developed in order to apply to the LHD 
research in the future. Therefore, the following issues are quite important to be established:  ①
Long  term  controlling,  ②Remote  operation,  ③Total  stability  of  the  system.  Thus,  we  have 
changed the system from the conventional liquid helium cooled type to the freezer type which 

might  have  caused  an  unfavorable  temperature  distribution.  The  following  points  should  be 

considered:  ①Precise mechanical drive controllability under very low temperature conditions. 

②Periodic behavior of pellet production with a proper temperature distribution.  ③Solving the 

adhering problem between pellet (solid hydrogen) and inner metallic surface of length limiting 

rod.  ④Reproducibility  of  pellet  cross  section  during  the  procedure  of  cutting  by  disk.  ⑤

Reproducibility and stability of the whole cooling system.   

  A  pellet  injector  system  of  new  type  with  precisely  and  continuously  controllable  of 

pellet  size  has  started  to  be  developed.  In  the  device  presently  developed  in  this  research,  we 

will precisely vary the length of the  cylindrical pellet (Φ  1.0mm) from 0.5 to 3mm by using 

the special "length limiting rod".

Abstract 

 

 

It  is  demonstrated  that  outer  and  inner  electron  shells,  including  that  formed  by 
collectivized  electrons  of  the  fullerene  C60,  affects  dramatically  the  cross  section  of  the 
subvalent  ns-subshells  of  the  noble  gas  endohedral  atoms  A@C60.  The  calculations  are 
performed  within  the  framework  of  a  very  simple,  so-called  “orange  skin”,  model  that 
makes it possible, in spite of its simplicity, to take into account the modification of the 
ns-subshell due to its interaction with inner and outer atomic shells, as well as with the 
collectivized electrons of the C60. As a concrete example, we consider the Xe 5s electrons 
completely collectivized by the powerful action of the Xe close and remote multi-electron 
neighboring shells.

1. Introduction 
 

The  pronounced  action  of  the  multi-electron  neighboring  5p6  and  4d10  subshells 
upon a few electron one, considering as an example the 5s2 subshell in Xe, was predicted 
in  the  frame  of  so-called  Random  Phase  Approximation  with  Exchange  (RPAE) 
approximately  thirty  years  ago  [1]  and  soon  confirmed  experimentally  [2].  Since  that 
time the photoionization of 5s2 in Xe and its neighbors like I, Cs and Ba, has become a 
subject of a number of investigations [3, 4].  

The  physical  nature  of  these  so-called  intershell  effects  is  as  follows.  A  many-
electron atomic subshell is polarized, or in other words, virtually excited by an incoming 
electromagnetic wave and therefore a time-dependent dipole moment is induced. Under 
the  action  of  this  dipole  moment  a  neighboring  atomic  subshell  is  ionized.  RPAE  is 
extremely convenient to describe this effect. Since the electronic subshells in an atom are 
not spatially separated well enough, the amplitude of this two-step photo-process cannot 
be  expressed  accurately  enough  directly  via  the  dipole  polarizabilities  of  the  many-
electron subshells. 

In this sense the situation for the endohedral atoms A@C60 is quite different. The 
radius  of  fullerene  С60  shell  significantly  exceeds  that  of  an  encapsulated  atom.  This 
makes  it  possible  for  photoionization  of  the  A  atom,  in  the  first  approximation,  to 
consider  the  electronic  sub-systems  of  the  fullerene  shell  and  atom  as  practically 
independent of each other. For this reason, the amplitude of atom photoionization going 

1

through  virtual  excitation  of  the  С60  shell  electrons  can  be  expressed  directly  via  the 
. In those cases when the frequency 
dynamic polarizability of the fullerene shell 
of  electromagnetic  radiation  is  close  to  frequencies  of  plasma  oscillations  of  the 
collectivized electrons of the С60 shell, a role of this two-step process becomes decisively 
important, as the role of 4d10 upon 5s2 in isolated Xe.

It has been demonstrated recently that the photoionization cross section of the Xe 
5s subshell in Xe@C60 is strongly modified due to reflection of the photoelectron’s wave 
by  the  fullerene  shell  [5].  A  simple  method  was  developed  to  take  into  account  this 
process [6]. The potential of the C60 shell was presented in [6] by of a zero-thickness δ-
type  bubble  potential.  In  this  approach  the  inner  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  C60  shell, 
namely its ability to be polarized, were neglected.  

However, it is known from experiment [7] that С60 has a dipole polarizability that 
is  extremely  big  in  atomic  scale.  The  frequency  dependence  of 
  exhibits  an 
almost symmetrical powerful maximum at the so-called Giant resonance frequency that is 
of  about  20  eV.  This  energy  is  close  to  the  ionization  potential  of  the  Xe  5s  subshell. 
Having in mind the strong modifications of the photoionization cross sections under the 
action  of  intershell  interaction  in  isolated  atoms  [1],  we  can  expect  strong  intershell 
effects for endohedral atoms as well.

Indeed, as we will demonstrate in this paper, the photoionization of Xe 5s subshell 
in the endohedral system Xe@C60 is a remarkable concrete example illustrating the role 
of the intershell interactions in the fullerene-like molecules, qualitatively similar but even 
stronger than in the isolated atoms. 

The aim of this paper is to clarify how the dynamic response of the multi-electron 
C60 shell affects the photoionization of the electron subshells of the endohedral atom. The 
method  developed  can  be  applied  to  other  objects  where  many  other  atoms  with 
collectivized electrons surround a given atom or an ion. 

 
2. Essential formulae 
 

The photoionization characteristics of very many complex atoms were calculated 
within  the  framework  of  RPAE  that  takes  into  account  along  with  the  direct  ionization 
amplitude of the considered electrons ds (in our case, these are the 5s electrons of Xe) the 
dipole polarization of other electron shells. The polarized shells ionize the s-electron due 
to inter-shell interaction. The approach developed for isolated atoms can be equally well 
applied to systems with other electron shells like endohedral atoms. 

Symbolically,  the  total  amplitude  of  some  s-electron  ionization  Ds  can  be

where the dashed line, line with arrow to the right (left) and the wavy line represent the 
incoming  photon,  electron,  vacancy  and  the  direct  (exchange)  Coulomb  “o-s”  electrons 
interaction, respectively. 
           The  equation  (1)  and  (3)  can  be  easily  generalized  in  the  spirit  of  the  Landau 
Fermi-liquid theory by incorporating into ds all but simple electron-vacancy excitations, 
for example, two electron – two vacancy excitations of the s-shell [9]

Note  that  a  similar  expression  has  been  suggested  recently  in  Ref.  [12]  on  the  basis  of

photoabsorption data that are considered in [12] as most reliable, we obtained Neff = 255. 
This is sufficiently close to the value, accepted in [14]. Note that since the one-electron 
60C  is much smaller than similar cross section for C60, 
photoionization cross-section of 
one  cannot  limit  with  this  cross  section,  measured  and  calculated  in  [13].  Obviously, 
other photoionization channels are of importance and have to be included.   
           As  seen  from  the  experimental  photoabsorption  cross  section,  it  is  small  at 
threshold  (which  also  means  relatively  low  intensity  of  discrete  excitations)  and  is 
dominated by  a huge maximum well above the  threshold. Therefore, in  Eq. (9) a small 
contribution of discrete excitations of the C60 collectivized electrons are neglected.

4. Discussion 
 

It  was  demonstrated  in  this  paper  that  dynamic  reaction  of  the  C60  collectivized 
electrons  modifies  essentially  the  photoionization  cross  section  of  the  inner  atom  in 
A@C60 at relatively low energy of incoming photons. Just as in pure classical approach 
[11],  the  here-performed  quantum  mechanical  calculations  demonstrate  that  the  inner 
80<ω eV 
atom at 
the cross section becomes enhanced.  

5<ω eV is totally screened while starting from 

10>ω eV and up to 

The angular distributions of the photoelectrons and their spin polarization have to 
be  also  modified  by  the  dynamic  reaction  of  the  C60  shell.  In  this  case  for  non-dipole 
terms  of  these  parameters  the  quadrupole  collective  excitations  of  C60  could  be  of 
importance. Unfortunately, almost nothing is known about these excitations until now. 
It  should  be  noted  in  conclusion  that,  as  it  follows  from  the  above-given 
 
consideration,  the  effect  of  dynamical  reaction  of  the  electronic  sub-system  of  the 
fullerene  shell  on  the  process  of  photoionization  of  encapsulated  atoms  is  completely 
  being  the  same  for  any  endohedral  systems 
defined  by  a  universal  function 
A@C60. This fact significantly extends a possibility of using the bubble model to describe 
the processes of electromagnetic radiation interaction with fullerene-like molecules.

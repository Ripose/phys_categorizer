Abstract 
 
The  performance  of  a  two-phase  Ar  avalanche  detector  in  a  single  electron  counting mode  was  studied,  with 
regard  to  potential  application  in  coherent  neutrino-nucleus  scattering  and  dark  matter  search  experiments.  The 
detector comprised of a 1 cm thick liquid Ar layer and a triple-GEM multiplier operated in the saturated vapour 
above the liquid phase. Successful operation of the detector in single electron counting mode, in the gain range 
from 6000 to 40000, has for the first time been demonstrated.

1. Introduction 

In  particular, 

The  development  of  detectors  having  a  low 
energy threshold and low noise is of paramount 
importance  for  present-day  and  future  low-
background  experiments. 
in 
experiments  searching  for  dark  matter  [1]  and 
coherent  neutrino-nucleus  scattering  [2,3],  the 
detector  should  be  sensitive  to  rather  weak 
ionization and scintillation signals produced by 
nuclear  recoils.  Cryogenic  two-phase  detectors 
in  general  [1]  and  specifically  two-phase  Ar 
detectors  [3,4,5]  are  currently  favoured  for

PMTs  [1]  or  Gas  Electron  Multipliers  (GEMs,

operated in an electron avalanching mode and is 
called  a  Two-Phase  Avalanche  Detector.  Its

mode in Ar, Kr and Xe [7,10,11,12].  

In  Ar,  the  average  nuclear  recoil  energy  is 
below 1 keV and 100 keV for coherent neutrino 
[2,3]  and  dark  matter  [4,5]  induced  scattering, 
respectively. Since only a fraction of the recoil 
energy  converts  into  ionization  and  excitation 
(of  the  order  of  20%  at  low  energies  [3]),  the 
primary ionization signal may consist of only a 
few  electrons.    This  is  particularly  relevant  for 
coherent neutrino scattering, where the primary 
ionization  signal  would  typically  be  a  single 
electron  signal  [3].  Thus,  in  this  type  of 
experiment  the  cryogenic  avalanche  detector 
must  operate  in  a  single  electron  counting 
mode, which is a real challenge. 

It has been recently demonstrated that a two-
phase Ar avalanche detector with a triple-GEM 
multiplier  can  be  operated  at  rather  high  gains 
(in particular compared to two-phase Kr and Xe 
avalanche  detectors), 
[12]. 
Optimizing  electronic  noise  appropriately,  the 
magnitude  of  this  gain  might  be  high  enough 
for the efficient detection of single electrons.

In this paper, the performance of a two-phase 
Ar  avalanche  detector  in  a  single  electron 
counting mode is studied for the first time. We 
show that a triple-GEM multiplier in two-phase 
Ar can effectively detect single electrons in the 
gain  range  from  several  thousands  to  several 
tens of thousands. 

 
 
2. Experimental setup and procedures 

A  detailed  description  of  the  experimental 
setup  has  been  presented  elsewhere [10,11,12]. 
Here we describe details relevant to the detector 
performance  in  a  single  electron  counting 
mode.  A cathode mesh, three GEM foils and a 
printed circuit board (PCB), of an active area of 
28×28 mm2 each, were mounted in a cryogenic 
vacuum-insulated  chamber  of  volume  2.5  l 
(figure  1).  The  distance  between  the  cathode 
and  the  first  GEM  was  12  mm,  between  the 
GEMs - 2 mm and between the third GEM and 
the  PCB  -  2  mm.  In  two-phase  mode  the 

detector  was  operated  close  to  the  triple  point, 
at a temperature of 84 K and a vapour pressure 
of  0.70  atm.  At  this  point,  the  thickness  of  the 
liquid  condensate  at  the  chamber  bottom  was 
approximately  1.1  cm,  which  is  a  factor  of  3 
larger  than  that  in  the  previous  measurements 
[12]. The electron drift path in liquid Ar before 
attachment was found to be about 1 cm at a drift 
field of 2 kV/cm. 

The detector was operated in a pulse-counting 
mode  using  a  pulsed  X-ray  tube.  The  anode 
voltage on the  tube was  50  kV. The width and 
frequency  of  X-ray  pulses  were  400  ns 
(FWHM) and 250 Hz respectively.

The  standard  direction  of  the  drift  field  is 
defined as that at which the electrons drift from 
the cathode towards the first GEM, i.e. the same 
as that in the GEM holes and in the transfer and 
induction gaps. The standard field direction was 
used  when  measuring  the  gain  characteristics 
and operation stability of the detector. In single 
electron counting mode, however, the drift field 
was  reversed,  in  order  to  suppress  primary 
ionization signals and to have only scintillation-
induced  photoelectric  signals  producing  single 
electrons  at  the  first  GEM  (see  figure  1  and 
section 4 for details). 

 
 
3. Gain and stability characteristics 

The  gain  values  used  in  the  following  were 
determined  with  the  standard  direction  of  the 
drift  field:  the  gain  is  defined  as  the  pulse 
height  of  the  avalanche  (anode)  signal  divided 
by that of the calibration signal. The calibration 
signal was recorded at the first electrode of the 
first GEM, with no high  voltage applied to the 
divider. 

Fig.2  shows  the  measured  gain  characteristic 
of  the  triple-GEM  in  two-phase  mode  at  84  K 
and  0.70  atm.  For  comparison, 
the  gain 
characteristic at room temperature at 1.9 atm, in

characteristics are similar to each other in terms 
of the slopes, confirming the statement that the 
avalanche mechanisms in the gas and two-phase 
modes are essentially the same. 

 

figure 1.  In the 3GEM configuration, the anode 
signal  was  recorded  from  the  last  electrode  of 
the third GEM. In this case the PCB was under 
floating  potential  and  the  field  lines  were 
terminated  at  the  last  electrode  of  the  third 
GEM,  providing  for  full  collection  of  the 
avalanching  electrons.  In  contrast, 
the 
3GEM+PCB  configuration  only  1/3  of  the 
electrons are collected at the PCB. On the other 
hand,  the  3GEM+PCB  configuration  is  more

The  cathode, GEM and PCB electrodes were 
biased  through  a  resistive  high-voltage  divider 
placed  outside  the  cryostat  (figure  1).    Each 
electrode  was  connected  to  the  divider  using 
high-voltage feedthroughs and 1 m long wires.  
The  anode  signal  was  read  out  from  the 
divider  using  a  charge-sensitive  preamplifier 
followed by a research amplifier with an overall 
sensitivity  of  11  V/pC  and  shaping  time  of  10 
µs.  In  the  current  work,  all  the  measurements 
were  done  in  a  triggered  mode,  the  trigger 
signal being provided by the X-ray generator.  

The  reduction  of  electronic  noises,  pick-ups 
and HV source ripples is of primary importance 
for  the  operation  in  single  electron  counting 
mode.  Therefore  the  following  measures  were 
taken to reduce them: all voltages were supplied 
to  the  divider  through  second-order  RC  filters; 
the line voltages were powered through ferrite-
ring  inductance  filters;  the  HV  divider  and  the 
preamplifier were placed in a shielded box; the

In  two-phase  mode  rather  high  gains  were 
obtained  in  the  3GEM+PCB  configuration,  of 
about  2×104.  In  the  3GEM  configuration,  even 
higher  gains  were  obtained,  reaching  about 
4×104.  These  gains  are  somewhat  higher  than 
those  reported  earlier  [12]  and  certainly  high 
enough  for  successful  performance  in  a  single 
electron counting mode.

The 

stability 

operation 

two-phase 
avalanche detectors is a principal question. For 
instance, it has been reported that when using a 
wire chamber [14] or Micromegas readout [15], 
the  signal  from  the  two-phase  Xe  avalanche 
detector  disappears  within  a  few 
tens  of 
minutes. On the other hand, stable operation of 
a  GEM-based  two-phase  avalanche  detector 
was  observed  for  several  hours  in  Ar  [12]  and 
Kr [11] and for half an hour in Xe [12], with the 
liquid layer thickness of 3 mm. 

Here  we  confirm  stable  operation  of  a  two-
phase Ar detector, having a thicker liquid layer 
than that in the previous measurements. Figure 
3  illustrates  the  operational  stability  of  the 
detector  over  a  period  of  5  hours:  the  pulse-
height  from  the  triple-GEM  at  a  gain  of  5×102 
is  shown  as  a  function  of  time  when  irradiated 
with  pulsed  X-rays  at  regular  intervals.    The

height from the triple-GEM (3GEM) at a gain of 5×102 is 
shown as a function of the time.  The signals are induced 
by pulsed X-rays. The drift field has the standard direction 
and is equal to ELAr=1.1 kV/cm. 

 
One can see that the pulse-height is stabilized 
after  two  hours.  The  initial  stabilization  period 
is  most  probably  due  to  the  time  needed  to 
smooth 
the 
cryostat.  Taking  this  into  account,  one  may 
conclude that the operation of the two-phase Ar 
avalanche detector is rather stable.

4. Single electron counting mode 

The  standard  practice  for  studying  single 
electron counting mode is to use a light source, 
with  the  intensity  gradually  decreased  down  to 
a single photon level, the single electrons being 
produced  at  the  photocathode  coupled  to  the 
detector. In our case, however, a mere decrease 
of the intensity of the X-ray tube does not result 
in  single  electron  counting  since  each  X-ray 
photon  produces  on  average  about  1000 
electrons in the liquid.

Therefore,  the  following  procedure  might  be 
applied  to  switch  to  a  single  electron  counting 
mode.  First,  with

the  drift  field  is  reversed.  This  results  in  the 
suppression of the primary ionization signal and 
only  the  photoemission  signal  from  the  first 
GEM,  induced  by  primary  scintillations  in  the 
liquid  Ar,  is  detected  (see  figure  1).  Here  the 
first (copper) electrode of the first GEM acts as 
a  photocathode,  providing  photoelectrons  for 
collection and multiplication in the GEM holes 
[16].  If  the  average  number  of  photoelectrons 
produced by X-ray photon scintillation is much 
below unity, the detector is operated in a single 
electron  counting  mode.  This  can  be  further 
explained as follows.

X-ray source intensity is decreased. The spectra 
are  exponential,  which 
typical  for  gas 
avalanche  detectors  when  counting  a  few 
electrons [8]. The curve slope characterizes the 
average  charge  recorded,  <q>.    In  a  single 
electron  counting  mode  this  is  simply  equal  to 
the gain.  

The counting efficiency can be determined as 
the  number  of  counts  under  the  curve  outside 
the  pedestal  normalized  to  the  total  histogram 
counts.  Figure  6  shows  the  curve  slope  as  a 
function  of  the  counting  efficiency  derived 
from  the  spectra  of  figure  5.  One  can  see  that 
when  decreasing  the  X-ray  intensity,  the  curve 
slope first decreases and then reaches a plateau 
at  lower  efficiencies.  This  is  a  signature  of 
operation  in  a  single  electron  counting  mode. 
Another  indication  of  this  is  that  the  average 
charge  on  the  plateau  derived  from  the  curve 
slope,  <q>,  is  consistent  with  the  gain  value 
measured with the standard drift field direction 
(in section 3).

curve  slopes  correspond  to  these  gains  with  an 
accuracy  of 40%, which is within the gain and 
curve slope measurement accuracies (see figure 
2  and  6),  again  confirming  that  the  detector 
counts  single  electrons.  At  larger  gains  some 
minor  secondary  effects  are  seen,  revealing 
themselves as a deviation from the exponential 
function  at  higher  amplitudes,  similarly  to  that 
observed for the triple-GEM operation in Ar at 
room temperatures [8].

Thus,  one  may  conclude  from  figure  6  that

It should be remarked that in the present work 
the  noise  rate  (without  the  X-ray  source)  was 
not minimized: it was of the order of several Hz 
at  the  discrimination  threshold  of  25  mV  and 
gain  of  several  thousands.  A  detailed  study  of 
the  noise  characteristics  of  the  two-phase  Ar

4×104.  One  can  see  that  due  to  the  different 
slopes  the  spectra  are  well  distinguished.  The 
capability  of  two-phase  avalanche  detectors  to 
distinguish a single electron spectrum from that 
of  a  few  electrons  is  very  useful,  in  particular 
for  characterization  of  the  neutrino  spectrum 
from  a  nuclear  reactor  in  coherent  neutrino 
scattering experiments [3]. In addition, it might 
be fundamental for measuring the carrier charge 
of the electron bubble in cryogenic liquids [20].

to  nuclear  recoils,  such  as  those  for  coherent 
neutrino-nucleus  scattering  and  dark  matter 
search experiments. 

In  the  present  work,  the  single  electron 
counting  mode  was  obtained  with  the  reversed 
drift  field,  the  single  electrons  being  produced 
by scintillation-induced photoemission from the 
first  GEM  acting  as  a  photocathode.  It  should 
be noted that a rather similar structure has been 
recently suggested in the concept of a so-called 
two-phase  avalanche  detector  with  Two-Phase 
Photoelectric  Gate  [21].  In  this  concept,  the 
electron  emission 
liquid-gas 
interface  is  eliminated  by  reversing  the  drift 
field and the signal is produced by proportional 
scintillations in the noble liquid recorded at the 
first GEM acting as a photocathode. Therefore, 
the results obtained in the present work are also 
encouraging for the realization of this concept.

The performance of a two-phase Ar avalanche 
detector  was  studied.  The  detector  had  a  1  cm 
thick 
triple-GEM 
multiplier  operated  in  saturated  vapour  above 
the  liquid  phase.  Triple-GEM  gains  as  high  as 
20000-40000  were  obtained  in  two-phase  Ar 
and  stable  detector  operation  in  an  avalanche 
mode for several hours was confirmed.

Successful  operation  of 

triple-GEM 
multiplier in two-phase Ar, in a single electron 
counting  mode, 
here 
has 
demonstrated  for  the  first  time.  In  the  gain 
range  of  6000-40000,  single  electron  signals 
were  found  to  be  well  separated  from  noise  in 
the  pulse  height  spectra.  The  pulse-height 
resolution  of  the  detector  was  good  enough  to 
distinguish single electron spectra from those of 
a few electrons. 

The successful performance of the two-phase 
Ar  avalanche  detector  in  a  single  electron 
counting  mode  allows  one  to  decrease  the 
energy threshold of the detector down to a few 
for 
tens  of  eV,  which

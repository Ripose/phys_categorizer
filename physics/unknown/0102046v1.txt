ABSTRACT

The mechanism of ablation of solids by intense femtosecond laser pulses is described in

an explicit analytical form.  It is shown that at high intensities when the ionization of the target

material is complete before the end of the pulse, the ablation mechanism is the same for both

metals and dielectrics.  The physics of this new ablation regime involves ion acceleration in the

electrostatic field caused by charge separation created by energetic electrons escaping from the

target.    The  formulae  for  ablation  thresholds  and  ablation  rates  for  metals  and  dielectrics,

combining the laser and target parameters, are derived and compared to experimental data.  The

calculated dependence of the ablation thresholds on the pulse duration is in agreement with the

experimental data in a femtosecond range,  and  it  is  linked  to  the  dependence  for nanosecond

pulses.

I. INTRODUCTION:

THE ULTRA SHORT PULSE LASER-MATTER INTERACTION MODE

The rapid development of femtosecond lasers over the last decade has opened up a wide

range of new applications in industry, material science, and medicine.  One important physical

effect  is  material  removal  or  laser  ablation  by  femtosecond  pulses  which  can  be  used  for  the

deposition of thin films; the creation of new materials; for micro-machining; and, in the arts, for

picture restoration and cleaning.  Femtosecond laser ablation has the important advantage in such

applications  compared  with  ablation  using  nanosecond  pulses  because  there  is  little  or  no

collateral  damage  due  to  shock  waves  and  heat  conduction  produced  in  the  material  being

processed. In order to choose the optimal laser and target parameter it is useful to have simple

scaling relations, which predict the ablation condition for an arbitrary material.  In this paper we

present  an  analytical  description  of  the  ablation  mechanism  and  derive  appropriate  analytical

formulae.

In order to remove an atom from a solid by the means of a laser pulse one should deliver

energy in excess of the binding energy of that atom. Thus, to ablate the same amount of material

with a short pulse one should apply a larger laser intensity approximately in inverse proportion to

the pulse duration. For example, laser ablation with 100 fs pulses requires an intensity in a range

~ 1013 – 1014 W/cm2 [1], while 30-100 ns pulse ablates the same material at the intensities ~ 108 –

109  W/cm2  [2].  At  intensities  above  1013 – 1014  W/cm2  ionization  of  practically  any  target

material takes place early in the laser pulse time.  For example, if an intense, 1013 – 1014 W/cm2,

femtosecond pulse interacts with a dielectric, almost full single ionization of the target occurs at

the  beginning  of  the  laser  pulse.    Following  ionization,  the  laser  energy  is  absorbed  by  free

electrons  due  to  inverse  Brehmstrahlung  and  resonance  absorption  mechanisms  and  does  not

depend  on  the  initial  state  of  the  target.    Consequently,  the  interaction  with  both  metals  and

dielectrics proceeds in a similar way which contrasts to the situation when a long pulse is where

3

ablation  of  metals  occurs  at  relatively  low  intensity  compared  with  that  for  a  transparent

dielectric whose absorption is negligibly small.

Another distinctive feature of the ultra short interaction mode is that the energy transfer

time from the electrons to ions by Coulomb collisions is significantly longer (picoseconds) that

the laser pulse duration (tp ~ 100 fs).  Therefore, the conventional hydrodynamics motion does

not occur during the femtosecond interaction time.

There are two forces which are responsible for momentum transfer from the laser field

and the energetic electrons to the ions in the absorption zone: one is due to the electric field of

charge separation and another is the ponderomotive force.  The charge separation occurs if the

energy absorbed by the electrons exceeds the Fermi energy, which is approximately a sum of the

binding energy and work function, so the electrons can escape from the target.  The electric field

of charge separation pulls the ions out of the target.  At the same time, the ponderomotive force

of the laser field in the skin layer pushes electrons deeper into the target.  Correspondingly it

creates a mechanism for ion acceleration into the target.  Below we demonstrate that the former

mechanism dominates the ablation process for sub-picosecond laser pulses at an intensity of 1013

–  1014  W/cm2.    This  mechanism  of  material  ablation  by  femtosecond  laser  pulses  is  quite

different from the thermal ablation by long pulses.

Femtosecond  ablation  is  also  sensitive  to  the  temporal  and  spatial  dependence  of  the

intensity of the laser pulse.  The Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA) technique commonly used

for short pulse generation [3] can produce a main (short) pulse accompanied by a nanosecond

pre-pulse  or  pedestal  that  can  be  intense  enough  itself  to  ablate  the  target.    Therefore,  an

important condition for the practical realization of the pure femtosecond interaction mode should

be that the intensity in any pre-pulse has to be lower than the thresholds for ablation or ionization

in  the  nanosecond  regime.  There  are  fortunately  several  methods  for  achieving  high  pulse

contrast (nonlinear absorbers, conversion to second harmonic, etc.) [4,5].

4

A rather simple and straightforward analytical model can describe the ultra short pulse

mode of laser-matter interaction.  The main features of this model were developed more than 10

years ago in connection with the ultra short and super intense laser-matter interaction [5]. In what

follows  this  model  is  modified  and  applied  to  the  problems  of  the  laser  ablation  at  relatively

moderate intensities near the ablation threshold for solids.  The absorption coefficient, ionization

and ablation rates, and ablation thresholds for both metals and dielectrics are expressed in terms

of  the  laser  and  target  parameters  by  explicit  formulae.    The  comparison  to  the  long-pulse

interaction mode and to the experimental data is presented and discussed.

2. LASER FIELD PENETRATION INTO A TARGET: SKIN-EFFECT

The  femtosecond  laser  pulse  interacts  with  a  solid  target  with  a  density  remaining

constant during the laser pulse (the density profile remains step-like).  The laser electromagnetic

field in the target (metal or plasma) can be found as a solution to Maxwell equations coupled to

the material equations.  The cases considered below fall in framework of the normal skin-effect

[5,6] where the laser electric field E(x) decays exponentially with the depth into the target:

here ls is the field penetration (or absorption) length (skin-depth); the target surface corresponds

to x = 0, and Eq.(1) is valid for x > 0.  The absorption length in general is expressed as follows

where  k  is  the  imaginary  part  of  the  refractive  index,  N = ε1/2 =  n  +  ik  ( ε

The main difference between these formulae and those ones for the conventional low-

intensity case resides in the fact that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity,

and thus, the plasma frequency and the effective collision frequency, all are intensity and time-

dependent.  The finding of these dependencies is the subject of next sections.

3. ABSORPTION MECHANISMS AND ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT

The light absorption mechanisms in solids are the following [7]:

1 .  intraband  absorption,  and  contribution  of  free  charge  carriers  in  metals  and

semiconductors;

2.  interband transitions and molecular excitations;

3.  absorption by collective excitations (excitons, phonons);

4.  absorption due to the impurities and defects.

At high intensities ~ 1013 – 1014 W/cm2, the electron oscillation energy in the laser electric field

is  a  few  electron-volts,  which  is  of  the  order  of  magnitude  of  the  ionization  potential.

Futhermore, at intensities above 1014  W/cm2  the  ionization  time  for  a  dielectric  is  just  a  few

femtoseconds, typically much shorter than the pulse duration (~100 fs).  The electrons produced

by ionization then in dielectrics dominate the absorption in the same way as the free carriers in

metals, and the characteristics of the laser-matter interaction become independent of the initial

state of the target. As a result the first mechanism becomes of a major importance for both metals

and  dielectrics.    In  the  presence  of  free  electrons,  inverse  Bremsstrahlung  and  resonant

6

absorption  (for  p-polarized  light  at  oblique  incidence)  become  the  dominant  absorption

mechanisms.

However,  one  should  not  oversimplify  the  picture.    The  electron  interaction  with  the

lattice (the electron-phonon interaction) and the change in the electron effective mass might be

significant  in  dielectrics  and  even  in  some  metals  [11].    The  number  density  of  conductivity

electrons in metal changes during the pulse.  We should also note that in many cases the real part

of the dielectric function is comparable to the imaginary part. Then the skin-effect solution (for

example, the simple formula Eq.4) should be replaced by a more rigorous approach.  We use

below  the  Fresnel  formulae  [8]  with  the  Drude-like  dielectric  function  for  the  absorption

coefficient calculations taking into account that the density of the target during the pulse remains

unchanged.  Then the conventional formulae for the reflection R and absorption A coefficients

are the following [8]:

we shall find below.

In the limit of low absorption A << 1, which holds for the high conductivity perfect metals, one

finds a simple expression the absorption coefficient (cf. Appendix A [3]):

It should be noted that the skin-depth is the function of the laser intensity and time.  This function

4. INTENSITY THRESHOLD FOR IONISATION OF DIELECTRICS

The dielectric function in dielectrics at low intensity of the electric field is characterized

by  the  large  real  and  small  imaginary  parts.    The  imaginary  part  increases  mainly  due  to

ionization.    There  are  two  major  mechanisms  of  ionization  in  the  laser  field:  ionization  by

electron impact (avalanche ionization); and the multiphoton ionization. The time dependence of

the number density of free electrons ne stripped off the atoms by these processes is defined by the

7

here na is the density of neutral atoms, wimp is the time independent probability (in s-1) for the

ionization by electron impact, and wmpi is the probability for the multiphoton ionization [5,9].

For the case of single ionization it is convenient to present the probabilities wimp and wmpi, in the

rate equation [1,9]:

necessary for atom ionization by the multiphoton process, Ji, is the ionization potential, and νeff is

the effective collision frequency.  It must be emphasised that the effective collision frequency in

Eq.  (8)  accounts  for  the  inelastic collisions  leading  to  the  energy  gain  by  the  electrons.    In

general, it  differs from the effective collision frequency in Eq. (3) and in the Sections below,

which accounts for the momentum exchange due to elastic collisions.

One can see from the Eqs. (8) and (9) that the relative role of the impact and multiphoton

ionization  depends  dramatically  on  the  relation  between  the  electron  quiver  energy  and  the

ionization potential.  If εosc > Ji then wmpi > wimp, and the multiphoton ionization dominates for

any relationship between the frequency of the incident light and the efficient collision frequency.

polarisation), it is evident that the multiphoton ionization dominates in the laser-interaction at

intensities above 1014 W/cm2 (for the 100-fs pulse duration this condition corresponds to the laser

fluence of 10 J/cm2.)

It is in a good agreement with the direct numerical solution to the full set of kinetic equations [1].

Electron  impact  ionization  is  the  main  ionization  mechanism  in  the  long  (nanosecond)  pulse

regime.  Then εosc << Ji and ω << νeff, and one can neglect the second term in Eq. (11) and the

number of free electrons exponentially increases with the product of wimp and the pulse duration:

.  In this case the ionization

time could be shorter than the pulse duration and the ionization threshold depends on the laser

intensity and laser wavelength.  It is conventional  to  suggest  that  the  ionization  threshold  (or

breakdown threshold) be achieved when the electron number density reaches the critical density

corresponding to the incident laser wavelength [7].  The ionization threshold for the majority of

materials lies at intensities in between (1013 - 1014) W/cm2 (λ ~ 1 µm) with a strong nonlinear

dependence on intensity.  For example, for a silica target at the intensity 2×1013 W/cm2 avalanche

ionisation dominates, and the first ionisation energy is not reached by the end of 100-fs pulse at

1064 nm.  At 1014 W/cm2 multiphoton ionisation dominates and the full ionisation is completed

after 20 fs.  It should be also mentioned that the ionisation threshold decreases with the increase

in the photon energy.

9

5. ELECTRON COLLISION FREQUENCY AND ENERGY TRANSFER FROM

ELECTRONS TO IONS

When the ionisation is completed, the plasma formed in the skin-layer of the target has a

free-electron  density  comparable  to  the  ion  density  of  about  1023  cm-3.    In  order  to  meet  the

ablation conditions the average electron energy should increase up to the Fermi energy εF, i.e. up

to  several  eV.    The  electron-electron  equilibration  time  is  of  the  order  of  magnitude  of  the

reciprocal  electron  plasma  frequency,  i.e.  ~ ω

−1  ~  10-2  fs  that  is  much  shorter  than  the  pulse

pe

duration.  Therefore the electron energy distribution is close to equilibrium and follows the laser

intensity evolution in time adiabatically adjusting to any changes.  The electron gas is non-ideal

in the high-density conditions: the energy of Coulomb interaction is comparable to the electron

kinetic  energy  and  there  are  only  few  electrons  in  the  Debye  sphere.    There  are  no  reliable

analytical  expressions  for  the  effective  electron  collision  frequency  in  this  energy-density

domain.  There are interpolation formulae for some materials in [10].  Physically sound estimates

could also be made.

The  effective  electron-ion  collision  frequency  could  be  estimated  by  approaching  the

Fermi energy from two limiting cases: from the low and from the high temperature limits.  In the

low-temperature limit the electron-phonon collisions dominate.  The electron-phonon collision

frequency increases in direct proportion with the temperature for T above the Debye temperature

TD.    In  the  opposite  high-temperature  limit  the  effective  frequency  of  electron-ion  Coulomb

collisions decreases with the electron temperature.  Thus, the effective collision frequency has

maximum at the electron temperature approaching Fermi energy.  The electron-phonon collision

frequency (or, the probability for an electron to emit or to absorb a phonon) one can estimate at

the temperature TD << T << TF as the following [7,10]:

Taking, for example Ji = 7.7 eV (first ionization potential for copper), TD(Cu) ~ 300 K, and MCu

10

= 63.54 a.m.u. one obtains νeff ~ 9×1015 s-1.  This estimate is very close to the effective frequency

at the room temperature 8.6×1015 s-1 extracted from the conductivity measurement [11].

At  high  temperatures  Te

F

>> ε   the  effective  electron-ion  collision  frequency  could  be

estimated  by  using  the  model  for  an  ideal  plasma  at  solid  state  density.    The  collision  is

considered as a 90-degree deflection of an electron path due to the Coulomb interaction with the

ion, and the collision frequency is the frequency of the momentum exchange.  According to [10]:

.

For  example,  from  Eq.13  the  electron-ion  collision  frequency  in  Copper  at  the  electron

temperature coinciding with the Fermi energy (ne = 0.845×1023 cm-3, ωp = 1.64×1016 s-1, TeV ~ 7.7

eV, lnΛ ~ 2) is νei = 2.38×1016 s-1.  This value is about twice higher than that estimated from the

low temperature case, and almost coincides with the plasma frequency, νeff ~ ωpe = 2.39×1016 s-1.

It seems reasonable to assume that νeff ≈ ωpe for the further estimates of the ablation threshold, as

it has been suggested in [1].  The value of νeff can be corrected by experimental measurements of

the skin depth (ablation depth).  Some more advanced models and interpolations for the effective

collision frequency were derived in [10].

Thus, in the ablation conditions νei >> ω.  Therefore the electron mean free path is much

smaller than the skin depth.  That is, the condition for the normal skin effect is valid.

The  electron-ion  energy  transfer  time  in  a  dense  plasma  can  be  expressed  through  the

(13)

(14)

collision frequency (13) as follows:

The estimation for copper yields the ion heating time  τ

ei  = 4.6×10-12  s, which is in agreement

with the values suggested by many authors [1,5,13].  A similar estimate for silica gives 6.4×10-12

s.  Therefore, for the sub-picosecond pulses (tp ~ 100 fs) the ions remain cold during the laser

pulse interaction with both metals and dielectrics.

6. ELECTRON HEATING IN THE SKIN LAYER

In the previous Section we have demonstrated that electrons have no time to transfer the

energy  to  the  ions  during  the  laser  pulse  τei  >  tp.    That  means  that  the  target  density  remains

unchanged during the laser pulse.  The electrons also cannot transport the energy out of the skin

layer because the heat conductivity time is much longer than the pulse duration.  It is easy to see

that  the  electron  heat  conduction  time  theat  (the  time  for  the  electron  temperature  smoothing

across the skin-layer ls) is also much longer than the pulse duration.  Indeed, the estimates for this

time with the help of conventional thermal diffusion [6] give:

here κ is coefficient for thermal diffusion, le and ve are the electron mean free path and velocity

correspondingly.  Using Copper as an example yields ls = 67.4 nm, κ ~1 cm2/s, and the electron

heat conduction time is in the order of tens of picoseconds.

The energy conservation law takes a simple form of the equation for the change in the

electron energy Te due to absorption in a skin layer [5]:

here Q is the absorbed energy flux in the skin layer, A = I/I0 is the absorption coefficient, I0 =

cE2/4π is the incident laser intensity, ne and ce are the number density and the specific heat of the

conductivity  electrons.    In  a  simple  model  of  the  ideal  Fermi  gas  the  electron  specific  heat

increases with electron temperature from the low-temperature level ce = π2Te/2εF for Te << εF

[11] up to the maximum value of ce ~ 3/2 for the conventional ideal gas at high temperature Te >

εF.  The specific heat could also be found as a tabulated function corrected on the experimental

measurements, which are usually evidencing the deviations from the simple model of the ideal

12

Fermi gas [11].  The absorption coefficient and the skin depth are the known functions of the

incident  laser  frequency  ω,  the  number  density  of  the  conductivity  electrons  ne,  (or,  plasma

frequency  ωpe), the  effective  collision  frequency  including  electron-ion  and  electron-phonon

collisions νeff, the angle of the incidence, and polarisation of the laser beam [5].  In fact, both

material parameters ωpe and νeff, are temperature dependent.  Therefore, Eq. (15) describes the

skin effect interaction with the time-dependent target parameters.  In order to obtain convenient

scaling  relations  for  the  ablation  rate  we  use,  as  a  first  approximation,  the  conventional  skin

effect approach with time-independent characteristics and with the specific heat of the ideal gas.

Such an approximation is applicable because at the ablation threshold Te  ≈ εF.  Thus, the time

integration of the Eq.(15) yields time and space dependencies of the electron energy in the skin

layer:

(16)

(17)

This  approach  is  well  justified  for  metals  because  the  temperature  dependent  skin-depth  and

absorption coefficient enter into the above formula as a ratio A/ls, which is a weak function of

temperature.  Indeed, in the low-absorption case (A<<1) for the highly conductive perfect metals,

the absorption coefficient expresses by (6), and the ratio A/ls is almost constant:

≈ 2ω

.

In the high absorption case this ratio changes weakly being of the same order of magnitude with

the  correction  factor  of  ~  1.3  (see  Appendix  A).    The  number  density  of  the  conductivity

electrons is also almost constant during the interaction time.

The  relationship  Eq.(16)  represents  an  appropriate  scaling  law  for  the  electron

temperature in the skin layer.  The experimental data correlate well with the prediction of the

Eq.(16).    For  example,  the  estimate  of  the  skin  depth  in  a  Copper  target  irradiated  by  a

Ti:sapphire  laser  (λ = 780 nm, ω  = 2.4×1015 s-1; νeff  ≈ ωpe =  1.639×1016 s-1, ne  =  0.845×1023

cm-3) gives  with  the  help  of  Eq.(4)  ls  =  67.4  nm.    The  maximum  electron  temperature  at  the

surface of the Copper target under the fluence AI0 tp = 1 J/cm2 reaches Te = 7,5 eV, which is close

to the Fermi energy for Copper.

7. ABLATION MECHANISM:

IONS PULLED OUT OF THE TARGET BY ENERGETIC ELECTRONS

It has been shown in the preceding section that the free electrons in the skin layer can

gain the energy exceeding the threshold energy required to leave a solid target during the pulse

time.  The energetic electrons escape the solid and create a strong electric field due to charge

separation with the parent ions.  The magnitude of this field depends directly on the electron

kinetic energy εe ~ (Te – εεsc) (εesc is the work function) and on the gradient of the electron density

along the normal to the target surface (assuming one dimensional expansion) [6,14]:

A ponderomotive force of the electric field in the target is another force applied to the

However, for the solid density plasma and at the intensities of ~1014 W/cm2 it is significantly

smaller than the electrostatic force eEa.

The field Eq.(18) pulls the ions out of the solid target if the electron energy is larger than

the binding energy, εb, of ions in the lattice.  The maximum energy of ions dragged from the

target reaches: εi(t) ≈ Zεe(t) ≈ (Te – εesc – εb).  The time necessary to accelerate and ablate ions

could be estimated with the help of the equation for the change of ion momentum:

The characteristic scale length for the expanding electron cloud is the Debye length lD ~ ve/ωpe,

where ve = [(Te – εesc)/me]1/2 is the electron thermal velocity.  Thus, the ion acceleration time, i.e.

the time required for the ion to acquire the energy of εe could be found with the help of (19) as

the following:

Below the ablation threshold, when Te ~ εesc + εb the acceleration time is much longer than the

pulse  duration.    However,  when  the  laser  fluence  exceeds  the  ablation  threshold  this  time  is

comparable and even shorter than the pulse duration.  For example, for Copper at F = 1 J/cm2

this time is less than 40 fs.  This means that for high intensities (fluences) well over the ablation

threshold the equation (15) for the electron temperature should include the energy losses for ion

heating.  This effect of electrostatic acceleration of ions is well known from the studies of the

plasma expansion [6,14] and ultrashort intense laser-matter interaction [5].

A. Ablation threshold for metals

According to Eq. (20), the minimum energy that electron needs to escape the solid equals

to the work function.  In order to drag ion out of the target the electron must have an additional

energy equal to or larger than the ion binding energy.  Hence, the ablation threshold for metals

can be defined as the following condition: the electron energy must reach, in a surface layer d <<

ls by the end of the laser pulse, the value equal to the sum of the atomic binding energy and the

work function.  Using the Eq.(16) for the electron temperature we obtain the energy condition for

the ablation threshold:

We assume that the number density of the conductivity electrons is unchanged during the

The  formula  (23)  predicts  that  the  threshold  fluence  is  proportional  to  the  laser

wavelength: Fth ~ λ.  We demonstrate below that this relation agrees well with the experimental

data.

B. Ablation threshold for dielectrics

The ablation mechanism for the ionized dielectrics is similar to that for metals.  However,

there are several distinctive differences.  First, an additional energy is needed to create the free

carriers, i.e. to transfer the electron from the valence band to the conductivity band.  Therefore,

the  energy  equal  to  the  ionization  potential  JI,  should  be  delivered  to  the  valence  electrons.

Second, the number density of free electrons depends on the laser intensity and time during the

interaction process as has been shown in Section IV.  However, if the intensity during the pulse

exceeds the ionization threshold then the first ionization is completed before the end of the pulse,

and the number density of free electrons saturates at the level ne ~  na, where na is the number

density of atoms in the target.  Then the threshold fluence for ablation of dielectrics, taking into

account the above corrections, is defined as the following:

=

(24)

Therefore, as a general rule, the ablation threshold for dielectric in the ultra short laser-matter

interaction regime must be higher than that for the metals, assuming that all the atoms in the

interaction zone are at least singly ionized.  Because the absorption in the ionized dielectric also

16

occurs  in  a  skin  layer,  one  can  use  the  relation  ls/A  ≈  λ/4π  for  the  estimates  and  the  scaling

relations (see Appendix A).

Another feature of the defined above ablation thresholds (21) and (24) is that they do not

depend  explicitly  on  the  pulse  duration  and  intensity.    However  it  is  just  a  first  order

approximation. A certain, though weak, dependence is hidden in the absorption coefficient and in

the number density of free electrons.

8. COMPARISON TO THE LONG PULSE REGIME

It is instructive to compare the above defined ablation threshold to that for the long laser

pulses.  This also helps in considering a general picture of the ablation process in a whole range

of laser pulse duration.

The ultra short pulse laser-matter interaction mode corresponds to conditions when the

electron-to-ion energy transfer time and the heat conduction time exceed significantly the pulse

duration, τei ~ theat >> tp.  Then the absorbed energy is going into the electron thermal energy, and

the ions remain cold εion << εe, making the conventional thermal expansion inhibited.  However,

as it was shown above, if the laser intensity is high enough, the electrons can gain the energy in

excess of the Fermi energy and escape from the target.  The electromagnetic field of the charge

separation created by the escaped electrons pulls the ions out of the target.  Hence, the extreme

non-equilibrium regime of material ablation takes place.  This regime occurs at the laser pulse

duration  tp  <  200  fs  and  at  the  intensities  above  1013-1014  W/cm2.    The  escaped  electrons

accelerate the ions by the electrostatic field of charge separation.

An intermediate regime takes place at the laser pulse duration 0.5 ps < tp < 100 ps and at

the  intensities  less  than  1011 W/cm2,  when  τei  ~  theat  ~  tp,  and  Te  ~  Ti.    The  most  appropriate

description of the heating and expansion processes in this regime is given by the conventional

two temperature approach [16].

17

At  the  longer  laser  pulse  duration  tp  >  10  ps  the  heat  conduction  and  hydrodynamic

motion dominate the ablation process, tp >> {τei; theat}.  The electrons and the lattice (the ions)

are in equilibrium early in the beginning of the laser pulse Te ~ Ti.  Hence, the limiting case of

thermal  expansion  (thermal  ablation)  is  suitable  for  the  description  of  the  long-pulse  ablation

mode.  The ablation threshold for this case is defined by condition that the absorbed laser energy

AI0tp, is fully converted into the energy of broken bonds in a layer with the thickness of the heat

diffusion depth lheat ~ (κtp)1/2 during the laser pulse [16]:

(26)

Equations (23), (24), and (26) represent two limits of the short- and the long-pulse laser

ablation with a clear demonstration of the underlying physics.  The difference in the ablation

mechanisms for the thermal long pulse regime and the non-equilibrium short pulse mode is two-

fold.

Firstly, the laser energy absorption mechanisms are different.  The intensity for the long

pulse interaction is in the range 108-109 W/cm2 with the pulse duration change from nanoseconds

to picoseconds.  The ionization is negligible, and the dielectrics are almost transparent up to UV-

range.    The  absorption  is  weak,  and  it  occurs  due  to  the  interband  transitions,  defects  and

excitations.  At the opposite limit of the femtosecond laser-matter interaction the intensity is in

excess  of  1013  W/cm2  and  any  dielectric  is  almost  fully  ionized  in  the  interaction  zone.

Therefore,  the  absorption  due  to  the  inverse  Bremmstrahlung  and  the  resonance  absorption

mechanisms on free carriers dominates the interaction, and the absorption coefficient amounts to

several tens percent.

18

Secondly, the electron-to-lattice energy exchange time in a long-pulse ablation mode is of

several orders of magnitude shorter than the pulse duration.  By this reason the electrons and ions

are in equilibrium, and ablation has a conventional character of thermal expansion. By contrast,

for  the  short  pulse  interaction  the  electron-to-ion  energy  exchange  time,  as  well  as  the  heat

conduction time, is much larger than the pulse duration, and the ions remain cold.  Electrons can

gain energy from the laser field in excess of the Fermi energy, and escape the target.  The electric

field of a charge separation pulls ions out of the target thus creating an efficient non-equilibrium

mechanism of ablation.

9. ABLATION DEPTH AND EVAPORATION RATE

The depth of a crater x = dev,  drilled  by  the  ultra  short  laser  with  the  fluence  near  the

ablation threshold F = I0t > Fth (23) is of the order of the skin depth.  According to Eq. (15), it

increases logarithmically with the fluence:

=

l
s
2

ln

F
F
th

ev

due to the exponential decrease of the incident electric field and electron temperature in the target

material.  Equation (27) coincides apparently with that from [17].  However, one should note

difference in definitions of the threshold fluence and skin depth in this paper from that in [17].

The skin depth calculated above for the laser interaction with copper target of 74 nm qualitatively

complies with the ablation depth fitting to the experimental value of 80 nm [17].

The average evaporation rate, which is the number of particles evaporated per unit area

per second, can be estimated for the ultra short pulse regime from (27) as the following:

One can see a very weak logarithmic dependence on the laser intensity (or, fluence).  For dev ≈ ls

≈ 70 nm, na ≈ 1023 cm-3, and tp ~100 fs, one gets the characteristic evaporation rate for the short

(27)

(28)

19

(29)

pulse regime of ~7×1030 1/cm2 s.  The evaporation rate for the long pulse regime depends only on

the laser intensity [2]:

.

Taking Ia  ~  109 W/cm2  and  ε

b  ~  4  eV  [2],  the  characteristic  ablation  rate  for  the  long  pulse

regime of ~ 3×1027 1/cm2s is about 2×103 times lower.

The number of particles evaporated per short pulse dev×na×Sfoc (Sfoc is the focal spot area)

is of several orders of magnitude lower than that for a long pulse.  This effect eliminates the

major problem in the pulsed laser deposition of the thin films, which is formation of droplets and

particulates  on  the  deposited  film.    The  effect  has  been  experimentally  observed  with  60  ps

pulses and 76 MHz repetition rate by producing diamond-like carbon films with the rms surface

roughness on the atomic level [2].

One also can introduce the number of particles evaporated per Joule of absorbed laser

energy as a characteristic of ablation efficiency.  One can easily estimate using Eqs.(28) and (29)

that this characteristic is comparable for both the short-pulse and the long-pulse regimes.

10. COMPARISON TO THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA

Let us now to compare the above formulae to the different experimental data.  Where it is

available we present the full span of pulse durations from femtosecond to nanosecond range for

ablation of metals and dielectrics.

A. Metals

Let us apply Eq.(23) for calculation of the ablation threshold for Copper and Gold targets

ablated by 780-nm laser.  The Copper parameters are: density 8.96 g/cm3, binding energy, e.g.

heat of evaporation per atom  ε

b  =  3.125  eV/atom,  ε

esc = 4.65 eV/atom, na  = 0.845×1023 cm-3.

The calculated threshold Fth ~  0.51  J/cm2 is in agreement with the experimental figure 0.5-0.6

J/cm2  [17],  though  the  absorption  coefficient  was  not  specified  in  [17].    For  the  long  pulse

20

ablation  taking  into  account  thermal  diffusivity  of  Copper  1.14  cm2/s  Eq.  (26)  predicts  Fth  =

0.045[J/cm2]×(tp [ps])1/2.

For a gold target ( ε

b = 3.37 eV/atom,  ε

esc  = 5.1 eV, ne = 5.9×1022 cm-3) evaporated by

laser wavelength 1053 nm the ablation threshold from Eq. (23) is Fth = 0.5 J/cm2.  That figure

should  be  compared  to  the  experimental  value  of  0.45  ±   0.1  J/cm2  [15].    For  the  long  pulse

ablation assuming the constant absorption coefficient of A = 0.74 (see Appendix A) one finds

from  Eq.(26) Fth  =  0.049[J/cm2]×(tp  [ps])1/2.  The experimental points [15] and the calculated

curve are presented in Fig.1.

An estimate for the ablation threshold for silica from Eq.(26) (ne ~1023 cm-3, ε

eV [24]) by a laser with  λ = 1053 nm (ω = 1.79×1015 s-1; ls/A ~ 83.8 nm) gives Fth = 2.4 J/cm2,

21

which is in a qualitative agreement with the experimental figures ~2 J/cm2 [1].  Formula (26) also

predicts the correct wavelength dependence of the threshold: Fth = 1.8 J/cm2 for  λ = 800 nm (ls/A

~ 63.7 nm) and Fth = 1.2 J/cm2 for  λ = 526 nm (cf. Fig. 2).  The experimental threshold fluences

for the 100 fs laser pulse [1] are: 2 – 2.5 J/cm2 ( λ = 1053 nm), ~ 2 J/cm2 ( λ = 800 nm), and 1.2

– 1.5 J/cm2 ( λ = 526 nm).

pulse regime Eq.(26) holds: Fth = 1.29[J/cm2]×(tp [ps])1/2 (see Fig. 3).

Fig. 3.  Threshold laser fluence for ablation of fused silica target vs laser pulse duration.  The

experimental error is ±15% [1].

The ablation threshold of 4.9 J/cm2 for a fused silica with the laser tp = 5 fs, λ = 780 nm,

intensity ~1015 W/cm2 has been reported in [21].  This value is three times higher than that of [1]

and  from  the  prediction  of  Eq.(26).  However,  the  method  of  the  threshold  observation,  the

absorption coefficient, as well as the pre-pulse to main pulse contrast ratio were not specified in

[21].

In the Ref. [22] the crater depth of 120 nm was drilled in a BK7 glass by a 100-fs 620-nm

laser at the intensity 1.5×1014 W/cm2.  Assuming that the skin depth in the BK7 glass target is the

same 84 nm as in the fused silica, the Eq.(29) for the ablation depth predicts the threshold value

of 0.9 J/cm2.  This is in a reasonable agreement with the measured in [22] Fth = 1.4 J/cm2.

It should be noted that the definition of the ablation threshold implies that at the threshold

condition  at  least  a  mono-atomic  layer  x  <<  ls,  of  the  target  material  should  be  removed.

Therefore, the most reliable experimental data for the ablation threshold are those obtained by the

23

extrapolation of the experimental dependence of the ablated depth vs  the  laser  fluence  to  the

‘zero’  depth.  As  one  can  see  from  above  comparison,  the  experimental  data  on  the  ablation

threshold  determined  this  way  are  in  excellent  agreement  with  the  formulae  in  this  paper.    It

should be particularly emphasised that there were no any fitting coefficients in the calculations

presented here.

11. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We  described  here  a  new  regime  of  material  ablation  in  the  ultra  short  laser-matter

interaction  mode.    The  regime  is  characterised  by  the  laser  intensity  in  a  range  ~  1013  –  1014

W/cm2 and the pulse duration shorter than the plasma expansion time, the heat conduction time,

and  the  electron-to-ion  energy  transfer  time.    The  interaction  at  such  conditions  results  in

ionisation  of  practically  any  target  material.    The  interaction  with  the  metals  and  dielectrics

proceeds  in  a  similar  way  in  contrast  to  the  conventional,  long  pulse  interaction  mode.    The

physics of this new regime of ablation consists in the ion acceleration in the electrostatic field

created by hot electrons escaping from the target.  We derived the explicit analytical formulae for

the ablation threshold, the electron temperature in the skin layer, and the ablation rates for metals

and dielectrics in terms of laser and target parameters.  These formulae do not contain any fitting

parameters and agree well with the available experimental data.  In this new regime the threshold

fluence is almost independent on the pulse duration, and the material evaporation rate is much

higher than in the long pulse interaction regime.

An important condition for the ultra short pulse interaction mode in the real experiments

is  the  high  contrast  ratio  of  the  pulse:  the  target  surface  should  not  be  ionized,  damaged  or

ablated  during  the  pre-pulse  action.    For  the  nanosecond-scale  pre-pulse  and  the  100-fs  main

pulse the intensity contrast ratio must be of the order of ~ 106.  The ultra short laser ablation can

do a variety of fine jobs without any collateral damage to the rest of a target: cutting and drilling

holes  with  a  high  precision,  ablating  all  available  materials  with  the  ablation  rate  of  several

24

orders of magnitude faster than that with nanosecond lasers.  The application of the ultra short

lasers  with  high  repetition  rate  for  film  deposition  allows  totally  eliminate  the  problem  of

droplets and particulates on the deposited film.  The theoretical background developed in this

paper  for  laser  ablation  allows  the  appropriate  laser  parameters  to  be  chosen  for  any  given

material and the laser-target interaction process to be optimized.

Correction in the brackets for ablation of Copper ablation at 780 nm (ω = 2.415×1015 s-1; ωpe =

1.64×1016 s-1) comprises 1.37.  For a Gold target ablation at 1064 nm (ω  = 1.79×1015 s-1; ωpe =

1.876×1016 s-1)  it  amounts  to  1.28.    For  the  short  wavelength  such  as  KrF-laser  or  higher

harmonics of Nd laser one should use the general formulae for the absorption coefficient and the

skin-length.

APPENDIX B: IONIZATION OF SILICA

The ionization potential of Si is Ji = 8.15 eV.  For Nd:YAG laser (λ = 1064 nm) at the

intensity 2×1013 W/cm2 the probability for the ionization by electron impact is wimp = 1013 s-1, for

the multiphoton ionization is wmpi = 5×10-4 s-1, and the number density of created free electrons in

100 fs is ne ~ 107.  At the intensity 1014 W/cm2 wimp = 1013 s-1; wmpi = 5×1014 s-1; and the number

density of free electrons reaches the solid density ne ~ na ~1023 cm-3 in 20 fs – this is the time

required for full first ionization.

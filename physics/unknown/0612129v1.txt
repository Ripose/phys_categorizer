CSC detector   

Erez Etzion, David Primor, Giora Mikenberg, Nir Amram and Hagit Messer, Fellow, IEEE  

Abstract—  The  new  particle  accelerators  and  its  experiments 
create a challenging data processing environment, characterized 
by large amount of data where only small portion of it carry the 
expected  new  scientific  information.  Modern  detectors,  such  as 
the  Cathode  Strip  Chamber  (CSC),  achieve  high  accuracy  of 
coordinate  measurements  (between  50  to 70 microns). However, 
heavy  physical  backgrounds  can  decrease 
the  accuracy 
significantly.  In  the  presence  of  such  background,  the  charge 
induced  over  adjacent  CSC  strips  (cluster)  is  different  from  the 
ideal  Matheison  distribution.  The  traditional  least  squares 
method which takes the same ideal position error for all clusters 
loses  its  optimal  properties  on  contaminated  data.  A  new 
technique  that  calculates  the  cluster  quality  and  uses  it  to 
improve  the  track  fitting  results  is  suggested.  The  algorithm  is 
applied  on  test  beam  data,  and  its  performance  is  compared  to 
other  fitting  methods.  It  is  shown  that  the  suggested  algorithm 
improves the fitting performance significantly.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

T

he  LHC,  the  largest  hadron  collider  ever  built,  presents 
new  challenges  for  physicists  and  engineers.  With  the 
anticipated  luminosity  of  the  LHC,  one  expects  as  many  as 
one billion total collisions per second, of which at most 10 to 
100  per  second  might  be  of  potential  scientific  interest.  The 
track  reconstruction  algorithms  applied  at  the  LHC  will 
therefore  have  to  reliably  reconstruct  tracks  of  interest  in  the 
presence of background hits.  

One of the two major, general-purpose experiments at LHC 
is called ATLAS.  Since muons are among the most important 
particles to be detected as a sign of new phenomena, a stand-
alone  muon  spectrometer  system  is  being  built  for  ATLAS 
[1].  The  ATLAS  muon  spectrometer  is  located  in  high 
radiation  background  environment  which  makes  the  muon 
tracking  a  very  challenging  task.  In  the  inner  station  of  the 
ATLAS  muon  spectrometer,  Cathode  Strip  Chambers  (CSC) 
system  is  employed  for  the  precision  measurement  of  muon

Though  many  particle  tracking  algorithms  were  developed 
the  High  Energy  Physics  (HEP) 
during 
community  (see  for  example  [2]),  the  requirement  of  high 
accuracy in an environment with such a high background level 
is  still  very  demanding.  In  the  presence  of  such  background, 
the charge induced over adjacent strips (cluster) of the CSC is 
different from the ideal distribution. Thus, the cluster position 
error  can  no  longer  assumed  to  be  as  an  error  of  an  ideal 
cluster.  Track  fitting  that  uses  the  traditional  least  squares 
(LS)  method  takes  into  account  the  same  ideal  position  error 
for  all  clusters,  and  thus  it  loses  its  optimal  properties  on 
contaminated data. We suggest a new track fitting technique, 
which  calculates  the  cluster  quality  and  distinguish  between 
“clean” and “dirty” clusters. It is shown that fitting algorithm 
that  uses  only 
in  better 
performance  than  other  methods  such  as  traditional  least 
squares  (LS)  and  even  weighted  least  squares  (WLS),  and 
robust fitting.   The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
on  section  II  the  CSC  detector  is  described  as  well  as  the 
experimental set up used to evaluate the fitting algorithm. On 
section  III  the  method  of  calculating  the  cluster  quality  is 
described. On section IV the different track fitting techniques 
are described and compared making use of test beam data. The 
results are discussed on section V.

II.  THE CSC DETECTOR AND THE TEST BEAM 

A.  The ATLAS CSC 

 
The  ATLAS  CSC  detector  [1]  consists  of  four-layer 
chambers  that  provide  a  position  measurement  based  on 
charge-interpolation.  When  an  energetic  particle,  presumably 
a muon, passes through the chamber, it ionizes a local region 
of  the  gas  that  fills  the  chamber.  The  ionized  cluster  of 
electrons  drifts  toward  a  nearby  anode  wire  and  a  charge 
avalanche is established. The charge avalanche induces charge 
on  two  sets  of  cathode  strips  that  are  mutually  perpendicular 
(there  are  192  strips  oriented  orthogonal  to  the  anode  wires 

 

 

 

and 48 strips parallel to it). The induced charge is spread out 
over several adjacent strips; each strip receiving a fraction of 
the  total  induced  charge.  The  spread  of  strips  that  receive 
charge  is  called  a  hit-cluster.  The  concept  is  that  with  the 
knowledge  of  the  interpolated  total  charge  passing  through  a 
layer,  calculating  the  relative  magnitudes  of  both  the  charge 
on each strip and the position of the strip in the hit-cluster will 
provide  the  information  required  to  find  the  centroid  of  the 
charge. The centroid is the position at the chamber where the 
ionization cluster originated, thus, the position of the energetic 
particle’s  track.  Figure  1  describes  the  charge  induction  over 
the precision strips. 

 

 

large systematic errors in their description. 

Since minor disturbance of the signal on at least one of the 
cluster  strips  may  disturb  the  measured  position,  we  classify 
the  hit  clusters  into  “clean”  and  “dirty”  clusters.  The  “clean” 
clusters are those which are well separated from other clusters, 
and  have  the  ideal  charge  distribution  as  expected  according 
to  the  Matheison  distribution  [5]  described  in  Figure  2.  The 
“dirty”  clusters  are  those  which  are  either  close  to  other 
clusters, or have a spatial charge different from the Matheison 
distribution.

B.  The Test Beam 
 

The  background  environment  of  the  LHC  experiments  is 
expected to be very high, especially in the forward regions. In 
order  to  study  the  performance  in  the  presence  of  high 
backgrounds, a CSC chamber was tested at the GIF radiation 
facility  at  CERN  during  July  2004.  This  facility  provides  a 
high  energy  muon  beam  in  conjunction  with  a  variable  high 
GBq Cs . Variable 
intensity radioactive gamma source 664
lead  absorbers  were  used  to  change  the  radiation  intensity. 
The beam illuminated area of the chambers was determined by 
trigger  counters.  A  detailed  description  of  the  summer  1998 
test beam setup for the CSC prototype is described in [3]. The 
main difference between that test and more recent ones is the 
lack of Si telescope in the second experiment.

III.  A QUALITY OF A CSC CLUSTER 

While  most  of  the  commonly  used  algorithms  for  track 
finding  and  fitting  assume  a  well  understood  shape  of  the 
charged  clusters,  even  in  presence  of  a  high  radiation 
background,  the  present  philosophy  has  been  to  use  all 
available  information,  combined  with  the  inherent  high 
efficiency  of  the  CSC  detectors,  for  track  finding  [4],  while 
making use of only clean charged clusters for track fitting. It 
will be shown that such a procedure provides a more accurate 
measurement  of  tracks,  since  the  “dirty”  clusters  have  carry

where λ′  is a predefined threshold. 
In  order  to  decide  about  the  range  of  the  thresholdλ′ ,  we 
calculate  Q  of (7) for two scenarios using the test beam data. 
For  the  first  scenario  we  use  data  received  when  the  gamma 
source  was  not  activated  (clean  data)  and  in  the  second 
scenario  we  use  the  data  received  when  the  source  was 
activated  (noisy  data).  In  Figure  3  we  plot  the  quality  values 
for  the  two  scenarios.  It  can  be  seen  that  a  threshold  value 
λ′ in  the  range  between  30  and  40  might  be  a  reasonable 
decision.   

It  is  shown  in  [6]  that  the  position  estimation  error  for 
“clean”  and  “dirty”  clusters  are  both  Gaussian  distributed. 
While  the  standard  deviation  (STD)  error  of  the  “clean” 
clusters  is  about  70  microns,  the  STD  error  of  the  “dirty” 
clusters  is  much  larger.  Since  track  fitting  with  least  squares 
(LS)  method  is  not  optimal  for  hits  with  different  errors,  the 
use  of  cluster  quality  has  a  potential  for  track  fitting 
improvement.  In  the  next  session  we  will  compare  several 
track  fitting 
the  quality 
techniques  with  and  without 
information.

is calculated using “clean” data from the test beam, while the bottom 
histogram is calculated using “dirty” data. In order to emphasize the difference 
in the tails, we used a logarithmic scale. The tail in the bottom histogram is 
longer (till about 1000), and the maximum value of 100 is picked for display 
reasons.  
 

IV.  TRACK FITTING 

A.  The track fitting techniques 
 

In  order  to  evaluate  the  benefit  of  using  the  segment 
quality, we compare different track fitting techniques realized 
on the test beam data. The first two techniques listed below do 
not utilize the cluster quality while the rest do use it: 

 

Least squares (LS) fitting – in this case all clusters were used 
for  the  track  fitting.  The  position  of  each  cluster  was 
calculated  using  the  ratio  algorithm  [3].  Then,  the  cluster 
positions were taken for a least squares fit. 
 
Iterative LS fitting – this iterative algorithm was suggested in 
[3]. A linear regression is applied for all clusters as a first step. 
Then, the cluster with the biggest residual is omitted, and the 
linear regression is applied again. Since the CSC has only four 
layers,  the  regression  procedure  can  be  applied  maximum 
three times. 
 
Weighted Least squares (WLS) fitting – in this case the cluster 
quality  was  calculated,  and  different  weights  were  given  to 
each  cluster.  Where  the  “clean”  cluster  got  weight  equal  to 
one, the “dirty” clusters got weight equal to 0.1.

compared  to  the  techniques  which  use  the  cluster  quality.  It 
can  be  seen  that  the  LS  technique  has  a  significantly  low 
efficiency compared to the other fitting methods.

Restricted LS fitting - only the “clean” clusters are used for the 
track  fitting  process.  In  the  cases  where  there  are  no  “clean” 
clusters, all clusters are used. 
 

B.  Comparison of the fitting methods 
 

information  was  not  available.  The 

In  order  to  compare  the  different  techniques  we  used  the 
test beam data with an average background rate of 3 KHz/cm2 
(about five times larger than the ATLAS expected background 
rate).  In  principle  the  algorithm  results  should  have  been 
compared  to  the  real  tracks  (“truth”).  However  since  in  the 
discussed  test  bean  there  was  no  reference  measurement  to 
cross  check  the  information  collected  with  the  CSC,  the 
”truth” 
test  beam 
experiment  produced  many  data 
files  with  different 
background  conditions.  Therefore,  the  data  collected  without 
active  gamma-ray  source  (referred  as  “clean  data”)  was  used 
as  our  “truth”  reference;  it  was  combined  with  data  taken 
when  the  source  was  activated  (“noisy  data”).  Only  events 
with four hits, one from each layer of the CSC were taken as 
valid  “truth”  data  points.  Then,  the  position  of  each  cluster 
was  calculated  using  the  ratio  algorithm  [3]  and  a  linear 
regression was applied for track finding. This track was taken 
to  be  the  “truth”.  We  define  a  track  fitting  efficiency  as  the 
ratio (5 ) /
Nσ
,  where  N denotes  the  total  number  of  tracks 
CSCn
(5 )
CSCn σ   is  the  number  of  reconstructed  tracks  which  is 
consistent with the track within five times the track resolution. 
The  track  resolution  is  the  standard  deviation  error  of  the 
estimated  muon  tracks  position  for  clean  events.    Figure  4 
describes the track fitting efficiency for the different methods. 
It can be seen that the Restricted LS method gets the best track 
fitting efficiency. This method requires calculating the cluster 
quality and uses only the “clean” clusters. If there is only one 
“clean”  cluster,  the  distance  between  the  cluster  position  and 
“truth”  is  used  for  the  efficiency  calculation.  Although  the 
WLS  and  Robust  fitting  algorithms  use  all  the  clusters  with 
appropriate weights, they have smaller efficiency compared to 
the  Restricted  LS  fitting  algorithms.  This  can  lead  to  the 
conclusion  that  the  “dirty”  clusters  should  not  be  used in the 
line  fitting  process.  The  Iterative  LS  method  applies  the  LS 

and

V.  DISCUSSION 

The local track identification is one of many new challenges 
in  experimental  HEP.  Several  fitting  methods  are  compared 
for  estimating  the  muon  track  in  the  ATLAS  CSC  detector. 
The  classification  of  the  cluster  into  “clean”  and  “dirty”  was 
proved  to  be  a  very  useful  technique for improving the track 
fitting efficiency. Unfortunately, at high background rate, we 
can get less than two “clean” clusters, a situation which leads 
to  a  poor  local  track  fitting.  In  these  cases  the  use  of 
information  from  other  components  of  the  ATLAS  detector 
can be of great help, and an overall fitting that uses only the 
“clean” clusters might be the right technique.

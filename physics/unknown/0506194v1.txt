Abstract 

We  present  recent  beam  data  from  a  new  design  of  a 
profile  monitor  for  proton  beams  at  Fermilab.    The 
monitors,  consisting  of  grids  of  segmented  Ti  foils  5µm 
thick, are secondary-electron emission monitors (SEM’s).  
We  review  data  on  the  device’s  precision  on  beam 
centroid  position,  beam  width,  and  on  beam 
loss 
associated with the SEM material placed in the beam. 

INTRODUCTION 
The  Booster  Neutrino  Beam  (BNB)  [1]  takes  8 GeV 
protons  from  the  Booster  accelerator  and  the  “Neutrinos 
at  the  Main  Injector  (NuMI)”  [2]  beam  takes  120 GeV 
protons  from  the  Main  Injector  (MI)  accelerator.    Both 
beam  lines  require  several  times  1020  protons  on  target 
(POT) per year.  Such fluences place stringent criteria on 
invasive instrumentation like SEM grids.   

Based on a design from CERN [3] we have designed a 
SEM consisting of Ti foils segmented at either 1.0mm or 
0.5mm pitch.  The foils are 5µm thick Titanium, and two 
planes of the segmented foils per SEM chamber provides 
both  horizontal  and  vertical  beam  profiles.    The  foil 
SEM’s provide several features over the Au-plated 75µm 
Ø W-wire SEM’s [4] in use at Fermilab:  (1) a factor 50-
60  lower  fractional  beam  loss  (see  below),  which  is 
important 
activation  or 
groundwater  contamination;  (2)  greater  longevity  of  Ti 
signal  yield  [5],  as  compared  with  W  or  Au-W,  which 
degraded  by  20%  over  the  course  of  running  the  KTeV 
fixed-target experiment [4]; (3) a ‘bayonnette’-style frame 
permitting  insertion/retraction  from  the  beam  without 
interruption  of  operations;  and  (4)  reduced  calculated 
the  high-intensity  proton-pulses, 
beam-heating  from 
which results in less sag of the wires/foils [6].

Foil SEM’s have been installed in the NuMI beam line 
in  2004.    Additional  detectors  are  envisioned  for  the 
8 GeV  line  to  the  Booster  Neutrino  Beam  and  for  the 
8 GeV transfer line between the Booster and MI in 2005.   

SEM DESIGN 
The  design  of  the  foil  SEM  chambers  has  been 
described in Ref. [7].  A few details are given here.  The 
chambers have two planes of segmented signal foils for X 
and Y profiles of the beam.  The foil strips have accordion 
“springs”  pressed  into  their  ends  near  the  support 
ceramics  to  provide  tensioning  and  compensation  for 
beam  heating.    To  achieve  5×10-6  fraction  beam  loss  the 
1.0mm pitch chambers have strips which are 0.75mm

over the 75mm aperture of the beam.  The paddle has an 
open area for the “beam out” position.   Each segmented

is  applied,  drawing  away 

As  described  in  Ref.[7],  the  actuation  of  the  device  is 
achieved by linear translation into the beam.  The motion 
has  ~4µm  repeatability,  with  an  additional  12µm  long-
term  drift  due  to  differential  thermal  expansion  of  the 
actuator. 
  A  linear  variable  differential  transformer 
(LVDT) confirms the position.

SEM’s.    The  last  two  stations  are  detectors  with  0.5mm 
pitch for accurate extrapolation to the NuMI target.

Placement  of  the  foil  strips  on  the  paddle  was  achieved 
with  10µm 
as  verified  with  optical 
measurements.  The spring tensioning permits <40µm sag 
of the strips.  Thermal simulations indicate that the linear 
expansion of the strips under beam heating of 4×1013 ppp 
will be <10µm [6]. 

NUMI BEAM EXPERIENCE 
Figure  2  shows  the  beam  profiles  at  10  stations  along 
the NuMI line.  The SEM’s have been used to commission 
the beam line, providing feedback and cross-checking of a 
new  BPM  system  installed  in  the  NuMI  line,  and 
confirming polarities of trims, dipoles, and quads.

In this section we present data on the SEM resolution of 
the  beam  centroid position and  the beam  width.   Finally, 
we discuss losses seen as a result of the SEM foils placed 
in  the  beam.    Studies  of  the  resolutions  are  aided  in  two 
locations  along 
redundant 
instrumentation  exists:    in  two  locations  are  located 
regions of free drift in which there are two SEM’s and two 
capacitative  Beam  Position  Monitors  (BPM’s).    The 
SEM’s and BPM’s are paired, with each pair separated by 
~10m.  In one location, the SEM’s are 1.0mm pitch, while 
in  the  second  region  (shown  in  Figure  2)  the  SEM’s  are 
0.5mm pitch. 

line  where 

Figure  3  shows  the  proton  beam  position  as  measured 
by  the  SEM  labeled  PMTGT  and  by  the  BPM  labeled 
HPTGT during a scan across the NuMI target.  The scatter 
about the diagonal is a consequence of the device   

resolutions.    Inspection  of  Figure  4  shows  horizontal 
bands  as  the  beam  position  was  incremented,  indicating 
that the spread of measured positions at each increment is 
smaller along the SEM axis than it is along the BPM axis.  
At  this  beam  intensity,  the  SEM  resolution  is  apparently 
smaller than the BPM resolution.   

Figure 5 shows the data of Figure 4 projected onto the 
BPM  or  the  SEM  axis.    The  number  of  spills  within  a 
particular  bin  of  Figure  5  is  indicative  of  the  duration  in 
time that the beam trajectory was set to a given location.  
The  width  of  the  peaks  is  indicative  of  the  device 
resolutions.  The fitted width of the peak at ~0.75mm, for 
example, is 18µm (54µm) for the SEM (BPM).   

The  observed  SEM  resolution  of  18µm  compares  well 
to  expectations  from  previous  beam  tests  of  the  foil 
SEM’s  [8].    There,  we  measured  the  beam  centroid 
resolution  at  three  different  beam  widths.    Extrapolating 
to the 1mm spot size in the NuMI beam, one expects 20-
30µm resolution, consistent with the present observation.  
Figure 6 shows the beam width as measured by PM121 
and PMTGT over several hours.  The beam converges as 
it heads to the NuMI target, but clearly the observed beam 
widths at the two stations correlate well.  The beam width 
is typically ~0.9mm at PMTGT, but some variation exists 
spill-to-spill  because  of  the  variation  in  beam  emittance 
from  the  Booster.    The  correlation  between  PM121  and 
PMTGT  shows  that  the  variation  is  not  due  to  device 
resolution.    Figure  7  shows  a  histogram  of  the  beam 
widths measured by PMTGT over the same period (open 
histogram),  as  well  as  for  a  ~½  hour  subset  (shaded 
histogram).   The  shaded  subset  shows  some  of  the  same 
large-emittance  spills,  but  also  shows  that a  predominant 
number  of  spills  at  0.93mm  beam  width.    The  fitted 
spread  of  the  shaded  peak  is  23µm,  indicating  that  the 
SEM’s  beam  width  resolution  is  smaller  than  this  value.  
These  observations  are  consistent  with  our  beam  test, 
which indicated a beam width resolution of 15-20µm for a 
beam width of twice the SEM grid pitch.

SUMMARY 
We  have  developed  a  large  aperture  segmented  foil 
SEM  for  use  in  the  8 GeV  and  120 GeV  beam  lines  at 
FNAL.    The  foil  SEM’s  are  observed  to  significantly 
reduce  beam  loss,  have  satisfactorily  performed  up  to 
beam intensities up to 2.5×1013 ppp, and have beam width 
and centroid resolutions consistent with expectations.

monitor SEM’s before the NuMI target.   

Figure  8  shows  the  beam  loss  as  measured  by  two 
ionization chamber loss monitors downstream of a pair of 
SEM chambers.  The two chambers, PM117 and PM118, 
are  both  removed  and  then  sequentially  re-inserted  into 
the  beam.    PM118  is  a  Tungsten-wire  SEM  (25µmØ), 
while  PM117  is  a  Ti  foil  SEM  (both  are  1.0mm  pitch). 
The  relative  increase  in  observed  loss  at  both  stations 
indicates that that PM118 causes approximately 5.9 times 
more loss than PM117.  We would expect that the W-wire 
SEM  would  have  a  factor  6.7  more  loss  if  scattering 
(radiation  lengths)  determined  beam  loss    or  a  factor  1.9 
more loss if nuclear interactions determined the loss in the 
SEM  material.    That  our  measurement  is  somewhat  in 
between these two values indicates that beam loss is due 
in  part  to  both  these  two  effects.      These  measurements 
indicate that the foil SEM’s reduce the beam loss relative 
to the 75µmØ W wire SEM’s [4] by a factor ~50-60.

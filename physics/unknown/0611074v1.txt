Abstract: In addition to the optical aberrations, the magnitude of the optical 
cells of detectors is one of the most important parameters, which restricts the 
resolution of detectors. Adaptive optic and the methods of reducing the 
aberrations are often used to increase the resolution of optical systems. In the 
best situation the image structures, which are larger than the magnitude of 
the cells, are detected and the finer structures are removed. In this paper, a 
new method for increasing the resolution of images is presented. In this 
method, the cells will scan the images by a piezoelectric crystal. The 
piezoelectric crystal moves the cells in  n  identical steps. In each step, cells 
1  of the cell magnitude and the data are recorded. Finally, data are 
move  n
analyzed and the structure of images is reconstructed. In this method, the 
structure of images is  n  times finer than the cells magnitude 

 
1. INTRODUCTION 
  
In addition to the optical aberrations and diffraction, the pixel size of the optical detectors is one of the most 
important parameters which restrict the resolution of the optical systems 
structures are smaller than the pixel size. Thus, the structures of image which are finer than the dimension of 
pixel are not detected and hence the maximum limit of resolution is defined by the pixel size of detector. To have 
a better optical resolution one may choose a detector which has more pixels in the unit length but it is more 
expensive.  

1.  In many situations the image 

Recently the sub pixel resolution methods are developed by authors  2- 4. In this paper we investigate the one 
dimensional case and introduce an algorithm and simulation for increasing the resolution of the optical detectors 
(IROD) . The pixels virtually divided by n parts. The detector is moved step by step, by a translator. After each 
step, the intensity of the pixels is recorded and after all there are n strings of data. These data will be analyzed to 
obtain an image which the resolution is enhanced.  
 
2. ALGORITM FOR INCREASING THE RESOLUTION OF THE OPTICAL DETECTORS 
 

Suppose that the pixel size of an array detector is L  and the number of pixels is N . The detector is moved in 
discrete steps by a translator. The limit of movement is  L  and amount of steps are n .The intensity of the pixel 
, will be recorded in each step. After a complete movement one has  n  
number j  , which is denoted by

reconstruction of the images. After recording one may calculate the intensity of the  n  virtual pixels of the first 
pixel. These values are the initial conditions for the calculation of the next virtual cells. At each stage one obtains

3. SIMULATION RESULT 
 
A computer simulation is used to illustrate the ability of the IROD algorithm. A reference image is generated by 
a  MATLAB program  and a graph of  its intensity in the horizontal direction are shown  in Fig.(1a) and (1b) 
respectively. The reference image has a wide range of frequencies. Figure (2a) is a simulation of the recorded 
intensity of a low resolution CCD. Figure (2b) is a graph of the Fig. (2a), in horizontal direction. Each pixel of 
the CCD is equivalent to e.g. 9 pixel of the reference image. To reconstruct a high resolution image, one may 
generate 9 images, 

, by the virtual movement of the CCD where the size of each step is, e.g.  9

1 pixel.

3. CONCLUSION 
 

In this paper the theory of IROD method and simulation are introduced for an array detector and the 

algorithms for the recording images and reconstruction of the fine structure of the image is presented. The IROD 
method increases the resolution of the ordinary detectors  n  times, where  n  is the number of the sub pixels. The 
authors believe that, this method will considerably decrease the cost of making accurate detectors. The 
experimental work and development of this method for two dimensional case is investigated by authors and will 
be reported later.

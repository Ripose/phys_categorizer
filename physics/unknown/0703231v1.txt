Mathematical formula describing the periodicity of the elements in the periodic system is 

presented.

(2)

In the periodic system (Fig. 1) the number of electrons in the completely filled outer shell 

(full-shell), and the atomic numbers of the elements with full-shell follow the sequences 

 8, 8, 2,

 18,

, 

 and

…118 86,

 

respectively.  In the structural development of the nucleus the same sequences should be present 

regarding to the number of protons.  No numerical solutions describing these periodicities are 
known3. 

Quantum mechanics does not give a complete explanation for the observed periodicity of the 
elements4.  The completed shells predicted by quantum mechanics are consistent only with the 
first two periods.  Later periods do not correlate with the quantum mechanical predictions.  The 

repeated pattern of the periods is not only marked by the same number of electrons/protons in the 

fully developed shell but also by the repeated pattern of the physical characteristics of the 

elements (Fig. 2). 

Double tetrahedron shape with alternately arranged protons and neutrons in face-centered 

cubic lattice has been proposed for the structure of the nucleus6.  This structure is able to 
reproduce all of the quantum numbers without discrepancy.  The generated numbers from the 

structure not only numerically match but also bear the same physical meaning as their 

corresponding quantum counterpart.  Additionally the sequence of the structural development of 

the double tetrahedron is consistent with the periodicity of the periodic system.  This consistency 

allows one to calculate the number of protons in the outer shell and the total number of protons 

in the nucleus and by that describe the periodicity of the elements.  The analytical solution is 

derived here.

The general description of the repeated periods in the periodic system can be given by the 

1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ...

I will call the numbers in Eq. (3)  to sequence numbers of the periods.  The relationship between 

the period and sequence numbers can be given as:

In each structural step of the development of the tetrahedron, starting with a four unit ‘core’ 

tetrahedron, one additional layer is added to the two outer sides (Fig. 3 b-d).  The number of 
nucleons [
numbers covering the two sides of the tetrahedron. 

 in these outer layers or shells is the sum of the two consecutive triangular

Each shell of the tetrahedron corresponds to two tetrahedron layer Eq. (7).  The relationship 

between the tetrahedron layers and the sequence numbers is

The derived analytical solution for the number of protons in a completely developed outer 

shell Eq. (11), and for the total number of protons in the double tetrahedron nucleus Eq. (19) 

reproduces the periodicity of the elements in the periodic system Eqs. (1), and (2) respectively.

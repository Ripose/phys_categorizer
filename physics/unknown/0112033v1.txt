Mechanics can be founded in a principle stating the uncertainty in the position of 

an observable particle δq as a function of its motion relative to the observer, expressed in 

a trajectory representation . From this principle, p.δq=const., being p the q-conjugated 

momentum, mechanical laws are derived and the meaning of the Lagrangian and 

Hamiltonian functions are discussed. The connection between the presented principle and 

Hamilton's Least Action Principle is examined.  

For a particle hidden from direct observation, the position uncertainty is 

determined by the enclosing boundaries, and is, thus, disengaged from its momentum. 

Heat, as a non-mechanical magnitude, stem from this fact, and thermodynamical 

magnitudes have direct expression in the presented formalism. 

It is finally shown that in terms of Information Theory, mechanical laws have 

simple interpretation. Kinetic and potential energies are expressions of the information on 

momentum and position respectively, and the law of conservation of energy expresses the 

absence of information exchange in mechanical interactions.

I. INTRODUCTION 

2 

Mechanics is the basis of the Physics building. In spite of their formal 

equivalence, each formulation of classical mechanics, Newton, Euler-Lagrange, 

Hamilton, Jacobi, contributes to clarify the fundamental concepts on which physics relies, 

and mediates the connection with other branches of Physics.[1] 

Whichever formalism is used, Mechanics has to be supplemented with statistics to 

support Thermodynamics, thus bridging the unknown mechanical trajectories with 

observable thermodynamics results. [2]. Quantum Mechanics shares this feature with 

Thermodynamics, since both deal with the uncertainties inherent in any description of 

observables. Classical Mechanics, on the other hand is said to correspond to an  infinitely 

precise description, or  to be the limit of Quantum Mechanics for Planck(cid:146)s constant, h, 

tending to zero. 

This contribution is an attempt to show that the above is not necessary, and that 

Classical Mechanics can be formulated in terms of the uncertainty associated with the 

description of observables. In addition to provide a new scope on mechanical laws, this 

formalism could aid in smoothing conceptual bridges between the main branches of 

Physics.

A. CONSTANCY OF THE MOMENTUM – SPATIAL UNCERTAINTY 

II. THEORY 

PRODUCT. 

The uncertainty in the spatial coordinate of an observable particle, δq, is related to 

a magnitude p, called the q-conjugated momentum, which characterizes its motion 

relative to the observer, through the constancy of their product. Representing this product 

by the function f of both variables, the above statement is expressed by 

 

 

δ
qpf
,

(

)

≡

 |p|. 

δ
q

=

const 

>

 

0

. 

 

 

 

(1) 

The meaning of δq is that the observer (cid:150)the system with which the particle is in 

interaction(cid:151)does not recognize two particle positions as distinct unless they are apart by 

δq or a greater distance. In this way, with regard to particle motion description, space 

appears segmented in δq(cid:146)s, which are, in general, position dependent. 

Eq. (1) states the Principle of Constancy of the function f (PCF) for observable 

coordinates [3] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B. DYNAMICS. THE TRAJECTORY DESCRIPTION.

The temporal evolution, motion dynamics, is obtained introducing time via the rate of 

change of f. From (1),

This result becomes the classical description, with the use of the trajectory 

representation, suggested by the motion of big bodies, as follows:  

The trajectory representation consists of assigning a position q(t) to each time 

instant t. Thus, space and time are related to each other along the particle motion by the 

magnitude particle velocity,  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(3) 

•

q ≡

dq
dt

. 

In this representation, and in accordance with the constraints imposed by PCF, the 

motion occurs within a sheaf of indistinguishable trajectories bundled by the extremes 

q(t) and (q+δq)(t) as depicted in Fig.1. In this case, 

(δ in (2), satisfies

6 

Eqs. (6) shows that £ has the properties of the Lagrange function of classical mechanics, 

and eq. (7) is the corresponding equation of motion. Eq. (5) states that the broadest 

meaning of the Lagrange function lies in the fact that its variation between the extreme 

trajectories of the indiscernible sheaf equals the rate of change of the f product.

where A is the Hamiltonian action defined by

. 

 

 

 

 

(9) 

 

 

The result (8), formally identical to Hamilton(cid:146)s Principle of Least Action (PLA), 

was obtained as a consequence of the Principle of constancy of f (PCF), 

.
f =0, and from 

(4) (cid:150)i.e. with adoption of the trajectory representation(cid:151)which leads to the identification 

(5) of δ£ with 
 

.
f .  

The PLA in Hamilton(cid:146)s formulation states:  The trajectory q(t) described by a 

certain degree of freedom of a system, given that q(t1) is q1 and q(t2) is q2,  minimizes (cid:150)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extremalizes- the action defined in (9). I.e. the variation of A from trajectory q(t) to a 

neighboring q(t)+ δq(t), given

(10a) 

must be zero. 

The PCF states: Let δq be the uncertainty in the value of the position coordinate q, 

i.e. the minimum change in position which may be perceived by an observer (an 

interacting body); and p, the momentum; motion occurs in such a way that the product 

f=|p|.δq  remains constant. 

In the PLA, δq is a virtual and arbitrary variation of the trajectory; and the 

equations of motion stem from the restriction (10a) that nulls the term 

 

t

qp δ  
.

t

(10b) 

in the calculation of δA by parts. 

In PCF, δq is a physically meaningful variable of the system (particle-interacting 

world), and the term (10b) in the calculus of δA vanishes with the constraint p.δq 

constant along the motion, which is less restrictive than (10a). 

Thus, PLA may be interpreted as a particular case of PCF, requiring that at t1 and 

t2, i.e. any given instant, the product p.δq = 0, or, equivalently, that the trajectory be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

known with infinite precision. As it was shown, this latest condition, though sufficient, is 

not necessary. It suffices to require p.δq = constant, which is more adequate for a 

description of the observable, even in the absence of actual observations.

which is the change in the value of the function H(q,p) while the particle passes from q to

The Hamiltonian function H, is related to the time evolution of f --eq.(13)(cid:151)similarly to £ 

(eq. 5). In both cases, 

.
f  equals the change of the corresponding function over the 

uncertainty interval δq. However, whereas the change in £ is between the closest 

indistinguishable trajectories at fixed time, the change in H is along the trajectory  in the 

course of time and motion. To emphasize this distinction, δ− is called change, whereas δ 

is referred to as a  difference or a variation. To summarize:

are valid without the symbol of modulus. The requirement

conservation of the Hamiltonian throughout motion.

which is Newton(cid:146)s second law, whereby the r.h.s. stands for the force (generalized force 

in case q is not a cartesian coordinate) acting on the body [4,5]. 

The two terms which add to δ-H in (13) are termed the change in the kinetic

formally, in the mechanical case, d£ and dH are related by 

d£ (q,

In the relativistic case,in which momentum and velocity are not mutually

term of eq. (21), consistent with the definition of £ in eq. (5). Using the relativistic

G.  A GATE TO THERMODYNAMICS. 

If the particle does not interact freely with the rest of the world, but, instead, 

through the walls of a box which encloses it; the uncertainty interval δq will be 

determined by the box linear dimensions, ∆q, and the f-product ceases to be constant 

since p and ∆q may vary independently. The constant in eq. (1) is, in this case, the 

minimum value of f  because ∆q can not be less than the δq corresponding to the free

change of momentum in the trajectory representation is, from the first equality in eq. (2)

The first term is the general expression for the mechanical force. Eq. (24) indicates the 

limit of mechanics whenever causes appear for the change of p, other than the change in 

the localization of the particle δq, along the trajectory. These causes are expressed in 

.
f ≠0, which requires that the particle be hidden from direct observation.

If the Lagrangian  £M, e.g. Lagrange(cid:146)s original, £M =E-V, has variation δ£M=0, how can

J.  MECHANICS AND INFORMATION 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

Information theory entered Physics through the concept of entropy [9-11]. It does 

not permeate into Mechanics because in the very definition of information lies the change 

of some interval of uncertainty, a non-existent entity in the classic formulation which 

assumes infinite precision in the knowledge of every magnitude. It is, thus, natural, in the 

present formulation, which relies, on the contrary, on the indetermination of the 

fundamental quantities (cid:150)eq. (1)-, to attempt an interpretation of Mechanics in terms of 

information. 

Consistency is achieved by choosing  |p| as the uncertainty interval, ∆p, for the 

knowledge of p. Thus f is an uncertainty product [12], and the information, I, 

corresponding to the mechanical state of the particle, defined by its position and 

momentum, is the sum of information on position and momentum, i.e.: 

 

 

dI  ≡ dIq + dIp = -(dln δq + dln |p|) = -dln f ,            (34) 

consistent with the relationship between information and entropy, and eq. (29) relating f 

to entropy. 

Consequently, PCF, eq. (1), means that, in mechanical interactions, the 

mechanical information of each observable coordinate is conserved (cid:150)i.e. the information 

that the interacting surroundings have about it-. Even more, as the value of  f is minimum

for mechanical interactions, the amount of information each part has about other is the 

maximum available (cid:150)though not infinite as presumed in classical formulation-.

suggests the name Principle of Zero Information Exchange (PZIE) for eq. (1) in this 

framework. 

In informational terms, mechanical laws have very simple forms. It can be 

verified, for example, that kinetic and potential energies, first and second terms of the 

second member in (13), represent information on momentum and position respectively, 

multiplied by kT; and the conservation of mechanical energy is, thus, a direct expression 

of PZIE. The limit of validity of Classical Mechanics is -footnote [5]-

III. CONCLUSIONS 

It has been shown that Mechanical laws can be derived from the constancy of an 

action product, f, without the assumption of an infinitely precise description. 

The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions acquire simple meanings in terms of 

the rate of change of the f-product, and the Hamilton Principle of Least Action results in a 

particular case of the law of constancy of f. 

Thermodynamics appears as a simple extension of the formalism, allowing 

changes of the f-product in time. Thermodynamical magnitudes are, in this way, simply 

related with mechanical magnitudes, in particular entropy with action. 

The formalism can be interpreted in terms of information theory, resulting the law 

of constancy of the function f, or the law of conservation of energy, equivalent to state 

that mechanical interactions occur without mechanical information exchange.

4.  Non conservative forces are included by replacement of the partial derivative in 

(17) by the total derivative along the trajectory, admitting, thus, changes in δq due 

to factors other than the position change. 

5.  The strict meaning of (16) is that δq is position independent, i.e., the motion 

occurs at constant p, in which case eq. (17) is meaningless. Thus, the newtonian 

force, responsible for the change in momentum, appears as an approximation for 

the case of smooth dependences of δq on q. This condition, which reminds 

Ehrenfest’s theorem, is the actual boundary of Classical Mechanics with Quantum

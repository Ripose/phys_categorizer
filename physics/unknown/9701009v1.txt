Abstract

The implementation of non–surjective Bogoliubov transformations in Fock states over CAR al-
gebras is investigated. Such a transformation is implementable by a Hilbert space of isometries if
and only if the well–known Shale–Stinespring condition is met. In this case, the dimension of the
implementing Hilbert space equals the square root of the Watatani index of the associated inclusion
of CAR algebras, and both are determined by the Fredholm index of the corresponding one–particle
operator. Explicit expressions for the implementing operators are obtained, and the connected com-
ponents of the semigroup of implementable transformations are described.

Introduction

The implementation of Bogoliubov automorphisms of the algebra of canonical anticommutation relations
(CAR) by unitary operators on Fock space is well–understood. Shale and Stinespring [1] have proven
that such an automorphism is implementable in a Fock representation if and only if the correspond-
ing one–particle Bogoliubov operator satisﬁes a certain Hilbert–Schmidt condition, and several authors
(e.g. Friedrichs [2], Berezin [3], Labont´e [4], Fredenhagen [5], Klaus and Scharf [6], Ruijsenaars [7, 8])
have constructed the implementing unitaries in terms of annihilation and creation operators.

Here we tackle the problem of extending these results to the case of Bogoliubov endomorphisms. As
suggested by the work of Doplicher and Roberts [9] on the theory of superselection sectors (see [10] for an
overview), the appropriate generalization of ‘implementation of automorphisms by unitary operators’ is
‘implementation of endomorphisms by Hilbert spaces of isometries’. An endomorphism ̺ is implementable
in a representation π of an arbitrary C*–algebra if and only if π
̺ is unitarily equivalent to a multiple of
π, and then the multiplicity equals the dimension of an implementing Hilbert space. For irreducible π,
implementability is tantamount to quasi–equivalence of π and π

̺.

◦

In the case of Bogoliubov endomorphisms and (irreducible) Fock representations of the CAR algebra,
one may apply the criterion for quasi–equivalence of quasi–free states due to Powers and Størmer [11] and
Araki [12] to conclude that a Bogoliubov endomorphism is implementable in the above sense if and only
if the corresponding Bogoliubov operator fulﬁlls the Shale–Stinespring condition. The dimension of the
implementing Hilbert space is then given by the square root of the Watatani index [13] of the associated
inclusion of C*–algebras, and this index in turn equals 2−

the Fredholm index of the corresponding isometric Bogoliubov operator V . As shown by Longo [14],

an analogous result holds in the theory of superselection sectors where the statistical dimension of a
localized endomorphism coincides with the square root of the Jones index of the associated inclusion of
local algebras.

We derive explicit formulae for the implementing isometries (i.e. for an orthonormal basis of the
implementing Hilbert space) based on the work of Ruijsenaars [8]. For this purpose, we generalize the
deﬁnition of Ruijsenaars’ operator Λ (called the ‘associate’ of a given Bogoliubov operator) and obtain
one implementing isometry Ψ0 in terms of the Wick ordered exponential of the unbounded bilinear
Hamiltonian induced by Λ. A complete set of implementing isometries may then be constructed by
multiplying Ψ0 with suitable partial isometries. In this way, the implementing Hilbert space itself acquires
a Fock space structure, with Ψ0 playing the role of the vacuum.

The set of Bogoliubov operators V fulﬁlling the Shale–Stinespring condition (for a ﬁxed Fock repre-
sentation) forms a topological semigroup w.r.t. a suitably chosen metric. By a result of Araki [15], the
subgroup of unitaries ( ind V = 0) consists of two connected components. We prove by contrary that each
subset of Bogoliubov operators with ﬁxed non–vanishing Fredholm index is connected.

Our interest in implementable Bogoliubov endomorphisms originates from the speculation that they
might serve to construct localized endomorphisms for free Fermi ﬁelds with non–abelian gauge groups [16].
We intend to discuss this idea in a subsequent paper. It should be mentioned that Bogoliubov transfor-
mations have been successfully used in the construction of localized endomorphisms in conformal ﬁeld
theory models [17, 18, 19].

This article is organized as follows. CAR algebras, Bogoliubov transformations and quasi–free states
are introduced in Section 2. Throughout the paper Araki’s formalism of selfdual CAR algebras [20, 12, 15]
is used which is equivalent to the more familiar notion of complexiﬁed Cliﬀord algebras over real Hilbert
spaces [21]. However, Araki’s approach has the advantage of being complex–linear from the beginning.
The usual description of a CAR algebra by means of annihilation and creation operators enters through
Fock representations of the selfdual CAR algebra. In this section, we also compute Watatani indices of
inclusions that are induced by arbitrary Bogoliubov endomorphisms.

Implementability of endomorphisms of C*–algebras is deﬁned in Section 3.1. We shortly discuss
uniqueness of implementing operators and indices of associated inclusions. Then we turn to CAR algebras
and Bogoliubov endomorphisms. We describe the decomposition of π
̺ into cyclic subrepresentations
where π is a Fock representation and ̺ a Bogoliubov endomorphism. The already mentioned Powers–
Størmer–Araki criterion then enables us to prove the validity of the Shale–Stinespring condition in the
̺
general case. We have included a new proof of a recent result of B¨ockenhauer [22] (decomposition of π
into irreducibles) in Section 3.2 since we consider our proof to have some interest on its own. We show
that π
̺ is equivalent to a multiple of either a Fock representation or a direct sum of two inequivalent
pseudo Fock representations, depending on the index.

◦

◦

Section 4 contains the main result of our investigation, namely the detailed construction of a complete
set of implementers for a given implementable endomorphism. In Section 4.1, Wick ordered unbounded
bilinear Hamiltonians and their Wick ordered exponentials are deﬁned in a representation–dependent way
with the help of unsmeared annihilation and creation operators. Then commutation relations of these
exponentials with annihilation and creation operators are computed. The associate Λ is characterized by
intertwining properties of the corresponding exponential, but is not unique. A complete set of implement-
ing isometries is deﬁned in Section 4.2. As a key to the proof of completeness, we present a decomposition
of ̺ into a product of two simpler transformations in Section 4.3. This product decomposition also leads
to an interesting decomposition of implementers.

Finally, we prove the aforementioned result on connectedness in Section 5. Our argumentation par-
allels in part the reasoning of Carey, Hurst and O’Brien in [23] and relies on the product decomposition
developed in Section 4.3.

3.1 Implementability of Endomorphisms

To generalize the notion of implementability to the case of endomorphisms we adopt ideas of Doplicher
and Roberts [9]. The unitary implementer Ψ above gets thereby replaced by a set of isometries fulﬁlling
the relations of a Cuntz algebra [30]. We give a deﬁnition for arbitrary C*–algebras.

Deﬁnition 3.1 A *–endomorphism ̺ of a C*–algebra A is (isometrically) implementable in a represen-
tation (π,

) if there exists a (possibly ﬁnite) sequence (Ψn)n

) with relations

By (11), we may regard the implementing isometries (Ψn)n

Then for m, n
Ψm = (ΨmΨ∗n)Ψn. This suggests to construct a complete set of implementing isometries by multiplying
one isometry Ψ fulﬁlling (14) with certain partial isometries in π(̺(A))′. We shall employ this idea in

4 Construction of Implementing Isometries

Our construction of implementers follows the lines of Ruijsenaars’ approach in [8] which is to our knowl-
edge the most complete treatment of the implementation of Bogoliubov automorphisms. Another advan-
tage of [8] for our purposes is the (implicit) use of Araki’s selfdual CAR algebra formalism.

Let us ﬁrst introduce some notation, followed by simple observations. Throughout this section P1 is

etc.

We also use matrix notation A =

V22∗V21 + V12∗V11 = 0,

V22 = V11,

V21 = V12.

whereas V = V gives

Since V12 is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator by Theorem 3.3, V22∗V22 is Fredholm (with vanishing index) by
(20). This means in particular

Note that V12|ker V22 is isometric and, by (21),

In the following, we are going to describe some operators by integral kernels. Thus we assume in this

section (without loss of generality)

ind V11∗ = dim(ker V11∗

4.1 Unbounded Bilinear Hamiltonians and Ruijsenaars’ Operator Λ

Bounded bilinear Hamiltonians have been introduced by Araki [20] as inﬁnitesimal generators of one–
parameter groups of inner Bogoliubov automorphisms. More speciﬁcally, one may assign to a ﬁnite rank
operator H =

Further properties of b are summarized in [12, 15].

Since elements B(k) with k

∈ K1 correspond to creation operators in the Fock representation πP1 , we

may write

πP1 (b(H)) = H12a∗a∗ + H11a∗a + H22aa∗ + H21aa

where the terms on the right are deﬁned by H12a∗a∗ := πP1 (b(H12)) etc. Introducing Wick ordering by
: a(f )a(g)∗ : =

a(g)∗a(f ), we get : H22aa∗ : =

H22∗a∗a = H22aa∗

: πP1 (b(H)) : = H12a∗a∗ + (H11 −

According to [8, 34], one may deﬁne such Wick ordered expressions for bounded H as follows. Let

(a(p)φ)(n)(p1, . . . , pn) := √n + 1φ(n+1)(p, p1, . . . , pn).

Since a(p) is not closable, one deﬁnes a(p)∗ as the quadratic form adjoint of a(p) on
ordered monomials a(qm)∗

The (Wick ordered, unbounded) bilinear Hamiltonian induced by H is then deﬁned in analogy to (26) as

it is linear in H. We deﬁne its Wick ordered powers as

How do we have to choose H in order to relate these quadratic forms to implementers for ̺V ? Let us

ﬁrst remark that we may restrict attention to antisymmetric H, i.e. to operators fulﬁlling

The operators H of interest are now selected by intertwining properties (cf. (14)) of : exp(b(H)/2) : . Let
aV (f ) = a(V11f ) + a(V12Γf )∗ denote the transformed annihilation operator as in (3). We are looking for

on
ker V11, (35) cannot hold for such g unless g = 0 (the l.h.s.
of (35) vanishes on ΩP1 , but the r.h.s. does not, cf. the proof of Lemma 4.2). We impose an additional
relation for vectors in ker V11 which will prove to be “correct”:

To solve (34)–(36), we have to compute commutation relations of

Proof. We ﬁrst note that a Wick ordered expression a(f )∗ : exp(b(H)/2) : + : exp(b(H)/2) : a(g) vanishes
if and only if f = g = 0. In fact, application to the vacuum gives a(f )∗ exp( 1
2 H12a∗a∗)ΩP1 which equals
zero if and only if f = 0 (to see this, look for instance at the one–particle component). Similarly,
( : exp(b(H)/2) : a(g)) a(g)∗ΩP1 =

2 H12a∗a∗)ΩP1 vanishes if and only if g = 0.

Section 4, we shall work exclusively with Λ(V ). But we emphasize that all the results in Sections 4.2 and
4.3 hold as well if Λ(V ) is replaced everywhere by one of the operators H described in Lemma 4.2. The only
point where the choice of the associate (of W below, not of V ) is distinguished is in Section 4.3 (Λ(W )12 =

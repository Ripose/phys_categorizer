Abstract
—The effect of the electron transverse and longitudinal velocity spread at the entrance to the interac-
tion space on wide-band chaotic oscillations in intense multiple-velocity beams is studied theoretically and
numerically under the conditions of formation of a virtual cathode. It is found that an increase in the electron
velocity spread causes chaotization of virtual cathode oscillations. An insight into physical processes taking
place in a virtual-cathode multiple-velocity beam is gained by numerical simulation. The chaotization of the
oscillations is shown to be associated with additional electron structures, which were separated out by con-
structing charged particle distribution functions.

INTRODUCTION

Hot  interest  in  a  new  class  of  powerful  electron
devices that emerged on the border between 1970s and
1980s  and  embraces  devices  using  a  virtual-cathode
(VC) electron beam as an active medium [1–4] still per-
sists [5–9]. Even in pioneering experiments and calcu-
lations, the complicated time-varying radiation pattern
of VC oscillators was noted [10–14]. VC chaotic oscil-
lations were investigated both theoretically and experi-
mentally [6, 8, 9, 14–18]. The occurrence of and inter-
action  between  coherent  space–time  structures  in  an
electron beam with a VC were studied in [17, 19–23].
Experiments  with  VC  oscillators,  as  well  as  their
visualization,  pose  grave  difﬁculties  because  of  the
need to use intense relativistic electron beams with cur-
rents exceeding a limit vacuum (supercritical) current
[24].  Experimental  conditions  for  generating  micro-
wave oscillations with a VC may be loosened by using
additional slow-wave structures where a nonstationary
oscillating VC is formed through severe slowdown of
the  beam  (an  electron  beam  with  a  supercritical  per-

and  chaotic  wide-band  signal  generation  may  take
place at low currents and electron densities in the elec-
tron beam, which makes it possible to perform detailed

Note  that  oscillations  in  such  a  slow-wave  structure  are  to  an
extent  similar  to  Barkhausen–Kurz  oscillations  [25]  and  also  to
those  in  an  electron  wave  generator  with  a  slowing-down  ﬁeld
[26].

experimental investigation of processes in a VC beam
by applying physical experimental techniques to micro-
wave  electronics  [29].  Such  VC-containing  systems
with  slowdown  may  serve  as  sources  of  noise-like
wide-band  chaotic  microwave  signals  of  medium
power.

It  was  shown  [27,  28,  30–32]  that,  in VC  systems
with additional slowdown, wide-band noise-like oscil-
lations with a typical bandwidth of more than an octave
are observed at certain values of the decelerating poten-
tial and beam current. These oscillations are fairly reg-

Note that the works cited above consider only single-
velocity beams of charged particles. However, of much
interest is to see how an electron velocity spread in the
beam (multiple-velocity beam generated by an electron
gun) inﬂuences the VC chaotic oscillations.

this way, we determined the noise power spectral den-

tions in the VC system.

Consider now how the oscillation parameters of the
system vary with the electron velocity spread. As was
mentioned above, oscillations in the system are caused
by the emergence of a VC in the intergrid space with a
decelerating ﬁeld. Experiments and numerical simula-
tions of the system with a decelerating ﬁeld [27, 28, 31,
32] demonstrate that, at very low decelerating potential

[
some of the electrons back to the ﬁrst grid. If the decel-
erating ﬁeld is relatively low, VC oscillations are near-
regular  and  the  radiation  spectrum  is  discrete. As  the
decelerating  ﬁeld  increases  further,  wide-band  noise-
like oscillations occur. At a sufﬁciently high decelerat-
ing ﬁeld, the oscillations cease.

Figure 4 illustrates the aforesaid for the system with
a low electron velocity spread (single-velocity beam).
In Fig. 4a, the oscillation normalized integral power is
plotted  against  potential  difference  ∆Vdec/V0  between
the grids at electron velocity spread ∆v/v0 ~ 0.2%. Inte-
gral power PΣ was measured throughout the oscillation
range  and  was  normalized  to  the  maximal  integral
power. It is seen that, when the decelerating ﬁeld is low,
so is integral power PΣ of oscillations in the VC beam.
As ∆Vdec/V0 grows, the power increases, reaches a max-
imum at an optimal value of the decelerating ﬁeld, and
then drops. Figure 4a also plots current ratio K, which
is deﬁned as the time-averaged current passing through
the output (second) grid, 〈Iout
〉 (〈 〉 means averaging), to
beam current I0 at the exit from the electron gun; that is,
〉/I0. It follows from this ﬁgure that, as deceler-
K = 〈Iout
ating voltage difference ∆Vdec grows, the amount of the
electrons  reﬂecting  from  the  VC  or  from  the  diode
space downstream of the cathode back toward the ﬁrst
increases.  When  potential  difference  ∆Vdec
grid 
between  the  grids  becomes  relatively  high,  the  elec-
trons totally reﬂect from the VC and so K ≈ 0. Under
these conditions, the VC in the electron beam becomes
stationary and the oscillations cease (the integral power
equals zero).

Figure 4b presents different typical oscillation con-
ditions of the VC in the system with a single-velocity
beam that correspond to different decelerating potential
ranges. Shown are the ranges in which the VC oscilla-
tions  are  absent,  regular,  or  wide-band  chaotic.  The
steady state of the beam changes to chaotic oscillations
through  the  periodic  dynamics.  As  the  decelerating
potential grows, the chaotic oscillations become more

complicated (the oscillation bands widen and the oscil-
lations become more regular).

Let  us  consider  the  effect  of  the  electron  velocity
spread with ∆V/V0 taken as a reﬂecting potential. In this
case, wide-band chaotic oscillations are established in
the system and the output integral power is close to a
maximum value.

Figure 5a plots the variation of oscillation frequency
∆f/f  and  irregularity  parameter  N  of  the  oscillation
power  spectrum  with  grid  voltage  Vg  =  Vgn,  ﬁlament
voltage Vf, and both voltages simultaneously. The band-
width and irregularity parameter describe the complex-
ity of oscillations in the system. As the frequency band
expands and the irregularity decreases, the oscillations
become more and more chaotic and noise-like.

It is seen that bandwidth ∆f/f is maximal when both
parameters are taken into consideration (curve 3) and
this  maximum  exceeds  that  for  the  single-velocity
beam  by  a  factor  of  1.6.  In  the  regime  optimal  for
obtaining complicated chaotic oscillations with c con-
tinuous spectrum (Vf = 20 V, Vg = 1.6Vgn), the irregular-
ity decreases to 4 dB.

Note that oscillations in a VC beam become compli-
cated with increasing velocity spread because of their
dynamic  nature  (dynamic  chaos)  and  not  because  of
noise in the beam. Measurements showed that the mean

demonstrates mean noise intensity S in the beam as a
function  of  ﬁlament  voltage  Vf  for  the  system  with
∆Vdec/V0 = 0.5 (shot noise versus Vf according to [34] is
also shown). The intensity of noise-like oscillations in
the VC beam is much higher than the shot noise inten-
sity, with the maxima of shot noise and noise-like oscil-
lations observed at Vf = 12 and 18 V, respectively.

An important control parameter of the electron wave
generator is the reﬂecting potential, with an increase of
which the oscillations become more and more compli-
cated, as was noted above. The dependence of the band-
width of wide-band chaotic oscillations on the reﬂect-
ing potential for the single-velocity beam and multiple-
velocity  beam  with  ∆v/v0  ≈  1.1%  (Vf  =  12  V  and

Vg/Vgn = 1.6) is shown in Fig. 5c. In the latter case, the
system starts oscillating at a lower decelerating poten-
tial,  ∆Vt/V0  ≈  0.05,  and  the  frequency  band  rapidly
expands to an octave at ∆Vdec/V0 ≈ 0.2. As the deceler-
ating  potential  continues  rising,  the  frequency  band
expands much more rapidly than for the single-velocity
beam, reaching 2.5–3.0 octaves (for the single-velocity
beam, the frequency band cannot cover more than an
octave, see [31, 32]).

3.  NUMERICAL  SIMULATION  OF  PROCESSES 
IN  THE  MULTIPLE-VELOCITY 
VIRTUAL-CATHODE  BEAM

Consider now the results of numerical simulation of
nonlinear  nonstationary  processes  taking  place  in  the
multiple-velocity  VC  beam  and  compare  them  with
experimental data for chaotic oscillations. We will be
interested  in  physical  processes  in  the  system  with  a
high electron velocity spread.

We will use a 1D model of the transit space with a
decelerating  ﬁeld  and  the  large-particle  method  [35,
36].  Obviously,  under  certain  operating  conditions  of
the  electron  wave  generator  applied  in  this  study,  the
electron  ﬂow  cannot  be  viewed  as  one-dimensional.
However, we may assume that basic physical processes
responsible for the VC formation in the diode space are
the same in both 1D and more complicated, 2D motion
of electrons.

The scheme of numerical simulation is as follows.
In the plane geometry, the electron ﬂow is represented
as a set of large particles (charged leaves). For each of
them, the relativistic equation

is  solved,  where  xi  is  the  coordinate  of  an  ith  leaf,

point with coordinate xi, and ϕ is the space charge ﬁeld
potential.

Potential ϕ, ﬁeld strength E, electron density ρ, elec-
tron velocity v, coordinate x, and time t used in Eq. (1)

The  space  charge  density  was  found  by  linear

is  a  piecewise  linear  shape  function  that  speciﬁes
weighting of a large particle on a spatial mesh with step
∆x.

Parameters Nm (the number of nodes in the spatial
mesh)  and  n0  (the  number  of  particles  per  cell  in  the
undisturbed state) were set equal to Nm = 800 and n0 =
24 (the number of particles in the domain of calculation
in the undisturbed state is then N = 19 200). Such values
of the parameters provide a desired accuracy in analyz-
ing  complicated  nonlinear  processes,  including  deter-
ministic chaos, in our electron–plasma system [36, 38].
The equation of motion was solved using the second-
order step-by-step scheme [36], and the Poisson equa-
tion  was  integrated  with  the  method  of  error  vector
propagation [6].

Injection of an electron beam with an initial longitu-
dinal  velocity  spread  was  simulated  with  a  modiﬁed
version of the method used in [35, 36] to reproduce par-
ticle initial distributions in plasma systems.

As electron velocity initial distributions, which were
speciﬁed at the entrance to the diode space, we took dis-
tribution functions f(v) found experimentally (see Sec-
tion  2  and  Fig.  2,  in  which  such  a  distribution  for
∆v/v0 ≈ 3% is shown). Then, we constructed function

Now, if we equate function F(vs) to some distribu-
tion of numbers Rs (Rs ∈ (0, 1)), it is easy to check that
the  distribution  of  vs  will  correspond  to  f(v).  Then,
choosing a set of numbers Rs (in our case, a total of 30
numbers, s = 0, …, 29, distributed from 0 to 1 were con-
sidered) and integrating (7) numerically in small steps,
we assign velocities vs to injected particles, with veloc-
ities vs being determined from the equality D(vs) = Rs.
Thus,  with  the  method  described  above,  one  can
preset any experimental electron velocity distribution at
the  entrance  to  the  space  of  interaction  (plane  z0  in
Fig. 1a).

4.  NUMERICAL  SIMULATION  OF  PHYSICAL 
PROCESSES IN A MULTIPLE-VELOCITY BEAM 
WITH A VIRTUAL  CATHODE

Consider  the  results  of  numerically  simulating  the
effect of velocity spread on chaotic oscillations in a sys-
tem with a VC for Pierce parameter α = 0.9 and ∆ϕ =
0.46, where ∆ϕ is the decelerating potential of the sec-
ond grid. At such parameters, the single-velocity beam
exhibits chaotic oscillations. As ∆ϕ increases, chaotic
oscillations  in  the VC  beam  become  more  and  more
complicated.

Beam current power spectra P(f) calculated near the
VC at different electron initial velocity spreads ∆v/v0
are shown in Figs. 6a–6c. The results of numerical sim-
ulation  support  the  experimental  data:  as  the  initial
velocity spread increases, oscillations in the VC beam
become  more  and  more  entangled;  speciﬁcally,  the
noise  pedestal  grows  (the  spectrum  becomes  noisy),
irregularity parameter N decreases, and the frequency
band of the chaotic signal expands.

parameter α = 0.9 and different velocity spreads and decel-
erating potentials: (a) ∆v/v0 = 0.5%, ∆ϕ = 0.46; (b) ∆v/v0 =
3%, ∆ϕ = 0.46; (c) ∆v/v0 = 5%, ∆ϕ = 0.46; and (d) ∆v/v0 =
3%, ∆ϕ = 0.6.

lation  frequency  band  ∆f/f  is  plotted  against  initial
velocity spread ∆v/v0 in the beam injected.

From  Figs.  6a  and  7a,  it  follows  that,  when  the
velocity spread is small (∆v/v0 < 0.01), the numerical
simulation does not show any signiﬁcant change in the
system’s behavior. For ∆v/v0 = 0.01–0.30, the chaotic
oscillation frequency band expands, the noise spectral
density  logS  increases,  and  the  irregularity  parameter
decreases  in  the  operating  frequency  band.  However,
when the velocity spread is high, ∆v/v0 > 0.4, the char-
acteristics  saturate  at  some  level  (i.e.,  cease  to  vary).
Such a dynamics of the system with increasing velocity
spread was also observed at other values of the Pierce
parameter and decelerating potential of the second grid.

The  same  behavior  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  7,  where
mean  noise  intensity  S  in  the  beam  is  plotted  against
irregularity parameter N normalized to the irregularity
parameter at the zero velocity spread, ∆v = 0, and oscil-

When the decelerating potential of the second grid
grows with the velocity spread ﬁxed, the dynamics of
the system also becomes complicated. This is distinctly
seen from the power spectra shown in Figs. 6b and 6d,

which  are  constructed  for  the  same  velocity  spread,
∆v/v0  =  0.03,  and  different  decelerating  potentials,
∆ϕ = 0.46 and 0.60. It follows from these figures that
the  noise  in  the  spectrum  grows  with  decelerating
potential: the basic spectral components and their har-
monics arise on the background of the growing noise
pedestal,  which  shades  some  of  the  harmonics  in  the
oscillation  spectrum.  Simultaneously,  the  basic  fre-
quency  of  the  power  spectrum  slightly  shifts  toward
higher frequencies, since the VC oscillation frequency
increases with decelerating potential [32].

The  related  integral  characteristics  of  the  power
spectra  are  shown  in  Fig.  7b,  where  they  are  plotted
against  the  decelerating  potential  of  the  second  grid.
The range of the potential corresponds to chaotic oscil-
lations in the VC beam for Pierce parameter α = 0.9.
The  curves  indicate  that,  in  the  presence  of  an  initial
velocity spread in the beam injected, an increase in the
decelerating potential complicates the spectral charac-
teristics of wide-band oscillations in the VC beam.

Let us concentrate on physical mechanisms respon-
sible  for  the  complicated  dynamics  of  a VC  electron
beam at a high velocity spread. Here, numerical analy-
sis of the system’s model behavior is of key importance,
since it allows for thoroughly considering physical pro-
cesses in the space of interaction.

Following  [17,  39,  40],  we  constructed  various
charged particle distribution functions in the space of
interaction for small and large particle velocity spreads.

Fig.  8.  (a)  Distribution  of  the  charged  particle  reﬂection
planes (leaves) in the space of interaction and (b) charged
particle  lifetime  distribution  for  the  beam  with  1)  small
(∆v/v0 = 0.5%) and (2) large (∆v/v0 = 3%) velocity spread
(α = 0.9, ∆ϕ = 0.46).

Figure 8 shows distributions Dx of reﬂection posi-
tions  xr  of  the  charged  particles  and  charged  particle
lifetime distributions Dτ (τ is the lifetime) in the space
of interaction for the beam with small (∆v/v0 = 0.5%,
dashed curve 1) and large (∆v/v0 = 3.0%, continuous
curve 2) velocity spreads. From Fig. 8, it follows that
the  beam  structure  in  the  region  where  the  particles
reﬂect back toward the plane of injection (i.e., near the
VC) changes qualitatively as the initial velocity spread
increases.

When the spread is small, particle lifetime distribu-
tion function Dτ has a single maximum, which corre-
sponds to the dynamics of a single structure forming in
the system, a virtual cathode. Time τ
0 at which the dis-
tribution function reaches the maximum, Dmax = D(τ
0),
is close to the characteristic time scale of oscillations of
this single VC; accordingly, quantity 1/τ
0 is close to the
frequency of the major spectral component in the power
spectrum  observed  under  the  given  conditions  (f0  in

Fig. 6a). Also, the distribution of the charged particles
over  the  coordinates  where  they  reﬂect  back  to  the
plane of injection shows that, in the case of a near-sin-
gle-velocity beam, there exists a domain in the space of
interaction, x ∈ (0.32, 0.43), where the reﬂection prob-
ability of particles at each point of this domain is nearly
the  same  (except  for  the  extremities  of  this  domain,
where  the  distribution  function  exhibits  small  peaks).
This domain may be arbitrarily referred to as the VC
width,  within  which  the  VC  oscillates.  Thus,  under
small-spread conditions, a single basic electronic struc-
ture, virtual cathode, emerges in the system.

Under  the  large-spread  conditions,  the  situation
changes.  In  this  case,  the  distribution  functions  have
several distinct peaks. Such behavior of the multiple-
velocity beam may be associated with the formation of
several VCs (several space–time structures) at different
distances from the plane of injection. This supposition
is  supported  by  the  distribution  of  coordinates  xr
(Fig. 8),  which  are  the  points  of  reﬂection  of  the
charged particles. This distribution function is heavily
irregular  and  can  be  divided  into  four  clear-cut  sub-
ranges where the electrons reﬂect toward the plane of
injection most frequently (i.e., has four peaks). Each of
the peaks may be assigned to a VC localized within its
own domain in the space of interaction. Note that the
peaks lie on high bases, because each of the VCs oscil-
lates in both space and time; however, the most proba-
ble  localization  sites  of  these  structures  are  precisely
the distribution peaks. The particle lifetime distribution
is  also  highly  irregular,  which  suggests  that  several
electronic  structures  emerge  in  the  multiple-velocity
beam.

Each of these structures (VCs) has its own charac-
teristic scale of oscillations. The partial reﬂection of the
electron  beam  from  each  of  the  structures  affects  the
formation conditions for other structures in the beam;
accordingly,  several  internal  feedback  loops  with  dif-
ferent  delay  times  arise.  An  increase  in  the  velocity
spread  in  the  beam  complicates  the  distributed  feed-
back in the system, increasing the number of forming
electronic structures. Thus, a high electron initial veloc-
ity spread in the beam adds to the chaotization of the
system’s dynamics, which shows up as the complica-
tion of the output radiation spectral characteristics.

5.  DISCUSSION

Our  investigation  demonstrates  that  an  increase  in
the electron velocity spread in the beam adds to the cha-
otization  of  VC  oscillations.  This  shows  up  in  the
expansion of the oscillation spectrum, an increase in the
noise spectral intensity, and a decrease in the irregular-
ity  of  the  spectrum  in  the  operating  frequency  range.
The  experimental  data  qualitatively  agree  with  the
results of numerical simulation performed in terms of
the  diode  model  with  slowdown.  Applying  such  an
approach, we gained a deeper insight into physical pro-
cesses taking place in a multiple-velocity beam with a

VC.  The  most  signiﬁcant  result  is  that  the  additional
chaotization  of  VC  oscillations  is  due  to  the  well-
known mechanism [23, 32], namely, the formation of
additional electronic structures, which were visualized
by constructing distribution functions for charged par-
ticles.

However, compared with the experimental data, the
numerical simulation in terms of the 1D model of elec-
tron beam dynamics gives a narrower oscillation band-
width and a much higher irregularity of the spectrum.
In our opinion, this is because the 1D theory was used,
which ignores the basically 2D dynamics of electrons
in  the VC  region.  In  particular,  Fig.  6  shows  that  an
increase  in  the  electron  longitudinal  velocity  spread
goes in parallel with the extension of the distribution of
electrons over angles of entry α—the effect, which is
taken into account in the 2D analysis of electron motion
near a VC. It appears that elaborating a 2D theory of
motion of an electron beam with a VC will be a main-
stream direction in research on electron wave genera-
tors of wide-band chaotic signals.

In closing, the complication of wide-band noise-like
oscillations in a VC beam (the fact predicted theoreti-
cally and veriﬁed experimentally) with increasing ini-
tial  spread  of  electron  velocities  and  angles  of  entry
could  be  used  for  optimizing  the  parameters  of  con-
trolled VC-based  microwave  generators  of  wide-band
medium- and high-power signals [27, 28, 31, 32]

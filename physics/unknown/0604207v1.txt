In  the  light  of  recent  experimental  and  theoretical  data,  we  go  back  to  the  studies 
tackled in previous publications (1) and develop some of their consequences. Yet this 
text  remains  self  sufficient.  The  questions  asked  following  these  studies  will  be 
answered.  The  consistency  of  these  developments  in  addition  to  the  experimental 
results, enable to strongly support the existence of a preferred aether frame and of the 
anisotropy of the one-way speed of light in the Earth frame. The theory demonstrates 
that  the  apparent  invariance  of  the  speed  of  light  results  from  the  systematic 
measurement  distortions  entailed  by  length  contraction  clock  retardation  and  the 
synchronization procedures with light signals or by slow clock transport. Contrary to 
what  is  often  believed,  these  methods  have  been  demonstrated  to  be  equivalent  by 
several authors (1). The compatibility of the relativity principle with the existence of 
a  preferred  aether  frame  and  with  mass-energy  conservation  is  discussed  and  the 
relation of the aether and the existence of mass is studied. The experimental space-
time  transformations  connect  co-ordinates  altered  by  the  systematic  measurement 
distortions.  Once  these  distortions  are  corrected,  they  reduce  to  the  Galilean 
transformations.  The  Lorentz

Foreword 
The study tackled in this text is partly based on ideas expressed in previous 
works, but in the light of new data, several topics which had been treated in 
these works and in particular in ref [1] will be revisited and supplemented. The 
questions asked to the author will be answered.

     Notice  that,  although  it  makes  reference  to  papers  already  published,  this 
text remains self sufficient. As we shall see, the theory developed here departs 
from  some  of  the  ideas  of  Einstein  and  Poincaré,  and  calls  into  question  the 
approaches that deny the existence of the aether or which suppose that there is 
no aether frame with specific properties that can be identified. It explains why 
the  assumptions  of  Lorentz  [2]  appear  today  far  better  justified  than  in  the 
past.  Moreover,  it  sheds  light  on  some  aspects  of  physics,  never  correctly 
explained before. 
     Yet  the  transformations  of  Lorentz-Poincaré  are  exactly  applicable 
exclusively when one of the reference frames under consideration is the aether 
frame, and it was necessary to search for a set of transformations applicable to 
any pair of ‘inertial frames’. These transformations are derived on the basis of 
experimental  data.  Our  approach  differentiates  completely  from  those  of  the 
classical authors (Lorentz, Larmor, Voigt, among others). 
     Notice  that,  the  frames  not  submitted  to  external  forces  other  than  the 
aether drift are called ‘inertial’ in this text, a term sanctioned by use. Yet, this 
designation  is  only  appropriate  when  the  aether  drift  is  weak.  In  this  case, 
these frames can be regarded as approximately inertial. But, as the aether drift 
increases, the inertial character is lost.  
 
I.  Introduction 
     In  the  days  when  the  result  of  Michelson’s  experiment  was  disclosed, 
Lorentz  tried  to  explain  the  process  without  dismissing  the  concept  of  an 
absolute aether frame by means of the following assumptions [2]: 
 - existence of a privileged inertial frame attached to the aether, speed of light 
isotropic and of magnitude C in this aether frame and different from C in all 
other ‘inertial frames’, length contraction and clock retardation. The time was 
considered  real  in  the  aether  frame  and  fictitious  in  all  other  frames,  which 
implied that the measurement of the time in those frames was distorted. 

(Note  that  the  approach  of  Lorentz  required  the  equality  of  the  two  way 
transit  time  of  light  along  the  two  arms  of  the  interferometer.  The  little 
difference  which  was  observed  was  considered  negligible  and  dependent  on 
the  inaccuracy  of  the  measurement.  The  modern  versions  of  Michelson’s 
experiment in vacuum [3] have considerably reduced this apparent inequality 
(Jaseja, Joos, Brillet and Hall, Müller et al)). 

We must realize that when Lorentz formulated his assumptions, although at 
first  many  physicists  were  convinced  of  the  existence  of  an  absolute  aether 
frame, there were no decisive arguments in favour of such a privileged frame. 

2 

In addition, most of them believed that the relativity principle could be applied 
without any restriction in the physical world and, progressively, they began to 
suspect  that  the  absolute  aether  frame  was  not  compatible  with  the  relativity 
principle. So, following the example of Einstein, they were led to abandon the 
aether frame in favour of the relativity principle. 

Moreover,  all  the  measurements  of  the  speed  of  light  gave  C  in  any 
direction of space, and in frames having no special properties (different from a 
privileged  inertial  frame  [4]).  The  measuring  process  of  this  speed  was 
generally considered indisputable and, therefore, was not called into question 
(see  later  and  [1]  or  [31]).  All  these  considerations  looked  to  be  in 
disagreement with the Lorentz assumptions. 

Poincaré tried to reconcile the application of the relativity principle with the 
Lorentz  assumptions  [5]  but,  as  we  shall  see,  the  two  concepts  are  in  fact 
incompatible. The way was therefore paved for the approach of Einstein which 
assumed absolute invariance of the speed of light in all ‘inertial frames’ and in 
all directions of space and equivalence of all these frames for the description 
of  the  laws  of  physics  [6].  The  said  assumptions  implied  reciprocity  of 
observations  (from  one  ‘inertial  frame’  to  another),  relativity  of  time  and 
relativity of simultaneity. (Contrary to Lorentz’s approach, the theory did not 
assume  the  existence  of  a  privileged  time,  all  the  times  measured  in  the 
different  ‘inertial  frames’  had  an  equivalent  status).  Michelson’s  experiment 
was  easily  explained  as  follows:  the  two  arms  of  the  interferometer  being 
equal, and the speed of light being isotropic, no fringe shift could occur. (The 
little  fringe  shift  observed  was  considered  negligible  and  resulting  from 
experimental error). Note that, for Einstein, length contraction was assumed to 
be reciprocal and observational, and therefore was nonexistent for an observer 
standing in the same frame as the arm under consideration. 

Being convinced of the reliability of the experimental data available at that 
time,  most  physicists  showed  agreement  with  Einstein  who  proposed  an 
approach in accordance with these results. 

But,  today,  a  number  of  theoretical  and  experimental  arguments  speak  in 
favour of the existence of an absolute aether frame and of the anisotropy of the 
one-way speed of light in the Earth frame (see later). 

There is no doubt that the relativity principle would exactly apply if perfect 
inertial frames did exist in the physical world (that is, in which a body at rest 
would  not  be  submitted  to  any  physical  force).  But  perfect  inertial  frames 
constitute an abstraction which is inappropriate if we assume the existence of a 

3 

preferred frame and of an aether drift whose magnitude varies as a function of 
the absolute speed of the frame.  

The anisotropy of the one-way speed of light gives a physical basis to the 
explanations  of  Larmor  [7],  Lorentz  [2]  and  several  prominent  modern 
physicists  who  assume  length  contraction  [8-17].  It  challenges  the  other 
theories:  Ritz  theory  [18],  (ballistic)  Einstein  theory  [6],  Stokes  theory  [19] 
(completely dragged aether). As we will see, the one-way velocity of light is 
erroneously found to be constant, because the measurements of the lengths and 
of  the  time  are  altered  by  systematic  distortions  due  to  length  contraction, 
clock  retardation  and  unreliable  clock  synchronization  (Einstein-Poincaré 
procedure or slow clock transport). 

Note  that,  insofar  as  the  velocity  of  light  is  not  exactly  constant,  the 
question of whether photons have a rest mass arises. Although the topic cannot 
be  studied  in  detail  here,  we  should  note  that,  following  Einstein  and  de 
Broglie, several authors in the past have discussed the possibility of a non zero 
photon mass. More recently, Van Flandern and Vigier [20], making reference 
to  the  Walker-Dual  experiment,  according  to  which  electrodynamic  fields 
propagate  faster  than  light  (a  result  compatible  with  causality  in  Lorentz’s 
approach)  noticed  that  the  experiment,  if  confirmed,  suggests  a  non  zero 
photon mass.  

Among  the  other  recent  publications  [21,  22],  Prokopec  et  al  suggest  that 
“the magnetic fields that seem to permeate the Cosmos, might have arisen if 
photons  possessed  mass  during  the  Universe  early  moments  of  expansion”. 
One may notice that a non-invariant one-way velocity of light implies that one 
can envisage a rest frame for the photon, a fact which was not possible with 
special  relativity.  This  result  removes  an  obstacle  to  the  existence  of  a  rest 
energy  for  this  particle,  and  therefore  of  a  rest  mass.  Of  course  it  is  not 
sufficient by itself to conclude, only the experiment can do this. The difficulty 
comes from the smallness of such a hypothetic mass: the most precise direct 
bounds yield

We propose here:  
1.  To  give  different  arguments  which  call  into  question  the  conventional 
approach of relativity, and permit to show:  
-the necessity of a fundamental inertial frame,  
-that relativity of simultaneity is only apparent and results from a confusion 
made between the instantaneous signals, and the light issued from them.

2.  To  demonstrate  that,  assuming  the  recent  arguments  in  favour  of  the 
anisotropy of the one-way speed of light, length contraction is no longer an 
ad hoc hypothesis, but a necessary cause of the Michelson result. 
-The  apparent  isotropy  of  the  two  way  speed  of  light  results  from  the 
systematic  measurement  distortions  entailed  by  length  contraction  and 
clock retardation. 
 
3.  To  derive  a  set  of  space-time  transformations  based  on  the  Lorentz 
assumptions,  but  more  general  than  the  Lorentz-Poincaré  transformations. 
After  correction  of  the  systematic  measurement  distortions,  the  hidden 
variables they conceal are disclosed.  
 
4. To point out some consequences of the theory: 

a.  The  classical  law  of  variation  of  mass  with  speed  is  completely 
exact, only if the mass of a body in motion is compared to its mass 
in the fundamental frame.   

b.  Insofar  as  an  aether  drift  exists,  the  relativity  principle  cannot 

exactly apply in the physical world. 

c.  The  compatibility  of  the  relativity  principle  with  mass-energy 

conservation is checked and the origin of mass is discussed. 

 
II.  Let  us  first  bear  in  mind  two  decisive  arguments  in  support  of  the 
existence of an aether frame and which call into question the application 
of the relativity principle in the physical world.   
The experimental arguments will be briefly presented in section II.3. 

II.1  Argument relative to the lifetime of the muon [23]

muons  were  discovered  in  1935  in  the  cosmic  radiation.  They  are 
The 
unstable  particles  whose  decay  gives  a  positron,  a  neutrino  and  an  anti-
). The half-life of these muons when they are at 
neutrino (
sec.  In  the  high  atmosphere,  the 
rest  in  the  Earth  frame,  t,  is  about  2.2 
muons move at a speed close to the speed of light. Their mean free path should 
therefore  be  approximately  L  =  Ct  =  660  m.  Nevertheless  the  measurements 
carried out for L give a much greater value, of the order of several kilometres, 
which  corresponds  to  a  half-life  T  much  longer.  According  to  special 
relativity,  the  proper  lifetime  of  a  particle  is  independent  of  its  speed  with 
respect  to  another  frame.  Therefore,  the  half-life  of  a  high  energy  muon 

610 −

measured by an observer at rest with respect to it should also be 2.2 
sec. 
This  statement  is  nevertheless  questionable.  The  reasons  which  justify  its 
challenge rest on the three following propositions: 

610 −

The  real  relative  speed  between  two  bodies  A  and  B,  receding  from  one 
another uniformly along the same line is invariant. It is the same for A and for 
B.  

The real relative distance does not depend either on which one measures it.   

Consequently,  the  real  time  needed  by  the  bodies  to  recede  from  each  other 
from distance zero to distance l must be the same for A and for B. 

     We can therefore conclude that the proper half-life of the muon at a speed 
close to the speed of light must also be T. These considerations lead us to infer 
that there is a difference between rest and motion, which implies that motion 
possesses  an  absolute  character.  In  other  words,  the  “rest  frame”  and  the 
“moving frame” are not equivalent and we are led to recognize the existence of 
a privileged aether frame designated as “Cosmic Substratum”.

The half-life of the muon at high speed is T. But clocks moving with it (at

So, t is not the real half-life, but the clock reading due to clock retardation. 
(This result is only approximate, because the velocity of the Earth frame with 
respect  to  the  Cosmic  Substratum  is  not  zero,  but  this  velocity  is  very  small 
compared to the speed of high-energy muons which approximates the speed of 
light).  

II.2 Poincaré’s relativity principle revisited 

This question has been treated in ref [1]. We propose to revisit the subject 

and to add some comments in response to the questions asked. 
     According  to  Poincaré’s  relativity  principle,  it  would  be  impossible  by 
means of an experiment internal to a given ‘inertial frame’ S to know whether 
this  frame  is  at  rest  or  in  motion  with  respect  to  the  aether  frame.  This 
statement  is  questionable  [23]  as  the  following  demonstration  will  show: 
consider two vehicles moving uniformly in opposite directions along a straight 
,  they  meet  at  a  point  O  in  frame  S  and  then 
line.  At  the  initial  instant, 
continue on their way symmetrically, at speed v, towards two points A and B 
placed  at  equal  distances  from  point  O.  At  the  instant  they  meet,  the  clocks 

0t

6 

inside the vehicles are synchronized. According to the relativity principle, the 
clocks should display the same time when they reach points A and B. If this 
was  not  the  case,  this  would  represent  a  criterion  capable  of  determining  if 
frame S is in motion or at rest with respect to the aether frame. But, insofar as 
the vehicles do not have the same speed with respect to the aether frame, the 
slowing  down  of  their  clocks  with  respect  to  the  clocks  at  rest  in  this 
privileged  frame  will  be  different  and,  therefore,  their  indications  will  be 
different. We note that in his postulate Poincaré assumes that ‘inertial frames’ 
are compatible with the existence of a preferred aether frame. But as we have 
seen,  this  assumption  is  contrary  to  logic.  (It  is  reduced  to  an  approximation 
valid when the aether drift is weak) 

Therefore  the  exact  applicability  of  the  relativity  principle  appears 
incompatible with the existence of an aether frame in a state of absolute rest. 
Since there are today a number of theoretical (see for example section II.1, and 
[1]) and experimental arguments (see later) lending support to the existence of 
an aether frame, the relativity principle cannot exactly apply. 
Discussion      
     We note that in the experiment we have just mentioned, the speed v of the 
vehicles  was  exactly  determined.  If  the  speeds  were  measured  with  clocks 
placed  in  A,  O  and  B,  synchronized  by  means  of  the  Einstein-Poincaré 
synchronization procedure, we can demonstrate that the clocks in the vehicles 
would  display  the  same  reading  when  they  reach  points  A  and  B.  But  this 
result follows from the systematic error made in measuring the speeds when, 
using this synchronization procedure, one assumes the isotropy of the one-way 
speed of light. If this systematic measurement error is needed in order for the 
laws  of  physics  to  assume  an  identical  mathematical  form  in  all  ‘inertial 
frames’, the application of the relativity principle misleads us and the principle 
is demonstrated to be inappropriate for the physical world. 
In  addition,  this  result  is  obtained  because  in  the  present  case  the  Lorentz-
Poincaré  transformations  apply  (see  section  V.I).  Yet,  as  we  will  see  in 
sections  V.2  and  V.3,  these  transformations  do  not  apply  to  all  experimental 
situations. 

II.3 Experimental arguments 

We have no means today to directly prove the existence of the aether, but 
its reality can be indirectly established by measuring the anisotropy of the one-
way  speed  of  light  in  the  Earth  frame.  (Note  that,  as  demonstrated  by 
Anderson et al [24], all the recent experiments purporting to demonstrate the 

7 

the

invariance  of  this  velocity  were  based  on  erroneous  ideas,  because  they 
assumed 
transport  procedure  enables  exact 
synchronization.  It  is  clear  that  this  is  not  the  case,  (see  ref  [1]).  On  the 
contrary, a number of arguments speak in favour of the anisotropy of the one 
way  speed  of  light.  Although  its  direct  evaluation  encounters  major 
difficulties, it can be deduced from the measurement of the absolute velocity 
of the solar system. A first estimate of this velocity had already been made in 
1968 by de Vaucouleurs and Peters [25], by measuring the anisotropy of the 
red shift of many distant galaxies. The experiment was repeated by Rubin in 
1976 [25]. A more reliable estimate of the solar system velocity was obtained 
by  measuring  the  anisotropy  of  the  2.7°K  microwave  background  radiation 
uniformly  distributed  throughout  the  Universe.  “An  observer  moving  with 
velocity v relative to the microwave background radiation can detect a larger 
microwave flux in the forward direction 
( v+  and a smaller microwave flux in 
the  rearward  direction
.  He  can  observe  a  violet  shift  in  the  forward 
direction 
( v− ” (Wilhelm [26]). 
( v+
From  this  data,  the  absolute  velocity  of  the  solar  system  could  be  measured 
(Conklin  (1969),  Henry  (1971),  Smoot  et  al  (1977),  Gorenstein  and  Smoot 
(1981), Partridge (1988)) [27]). Let us also quote the method of measurement 
based  on  the  muon  flux  anisotropy  (Monstein  and  Wesley  (1996))  [28]. 
Wesley [29] and Wilhelm [26] give an assessment of all these experiments.

Another verification of the absolute speed of the Earth frame was made by 
Roland  De  Witte  in  1991.  To  that  end,  5  MHz  radio-frequency  signals  were 
sent in two opposite directions through two buried co-axial cables linking two 
caesium  beam  atomic  clocks  separated  by  1.5  Km.  Changes  in  propagation 
times  were  observed  and  were  recorded  over  178  days.  De  Witte  interpreted 
the results as evidence of absolute motion [27]. 

More  recently  (April  2003),  Cahill  and  Kitto  reinterpreted  Michelson  and 
Morley’s experiments. They asserted that Michelson interferometers operating 
in  gas  mode  are  capable  of  revealing the  Earth’s  absolute  motion  [27].  They 
interferometers 
analysed 
experiments  which  always  showed  small  but  significant  effects.  The  authors 
asserted  that  after  correcting  for  the  refractive  index  of  the  air,  the  Miller 
experiment gives a speed of v=335 ± 57 Km/sec.

results 

If  confirmed,  these  results  (from  De  Witte  to  Cahill)  provide  further 
weighty arguments in favour of the existence of a fundamental aether frame, in 
addition to the other arguments previously mentioned.

      Marinov  also  attested  having  measured  the  absolute  velocity  of  the  solar 
system by means of different devices (coupled mirrors experiment and toothed 
wheels  experiment  [30]).  According  to  Wesley  [29],  “the  Marinov  (1974, 
1977a,  1980b)  coupled  mirrors  experiment  is  one  of  the  most  brilliant  and 
ingenious  experiments  of  all  time.  It  measures  the  very  small  quantity  v/C, 
where  v  is  the  absolute  velocity  of  the  observer,  by  using  very  clever 
stratagems”. 

The coupled mirrors experiment enabled the author to assert that the solar 
  is  of  the  order  of  300  ±  20  km/sec  and  that  the 
system  absolute  velocity 
vC +   in  the  opposite 
  in  its  direction  of  motion  and 
speed  of  light  is 
direction.  (Notice  that  the  orbital  motion  of  the  Earth  around  the  sun  is  far 
slower (about 30 km/sec) and that the rotational motion at the latitude of the 
experiment was of the order of 0.5 km/sec).

All the above-mentioned experiments gave a result of the same order as the 
result obtained by Marinov. They demonstrated the existence of a fundamental 
frame whose absolute speed is zero, but whose relative speed with respect to 
the Earth frame is of the order of 350 km/sec. 

 

     III. Critical approach of the relativity of simultaneity. 

Let  us  briefly  bear  in  mind  the  arguments  of  special  relativity  and 
succinctly reply. The question has also been studied in ref [32] in a different 
way.  According 
two  distant  events,  which  are 
simultaneous for one observer, are not for another moving with respect to the 
first with rectilinear uniform motion. 

to  special  relativity, 

In  order  to  demonstrate  this  theorem,  Einstein  takes  the  classical  example 
of the train and the two flashes of lightning [33]: two flashes strike at the two 
ends A and B of an embankment at the very instant when the middle O’ of the 
train meets the middle O of the embankment (Einstein). By definition, the two 
flashes will be considered simultaneous with respect to the embankment if the 
light  issuing  from  them  meets  the  middle  of  the  embankment  at  the  same 
instant. Einstein adds that the definition is also valid for the train, but as the 
train travels towards point B, the light coming from B will reach the middle of 
the  train  before  the  light  coming  from  A.  Einstein  concludes  that  two  events 
simultaneous  for 
the  embankment  are  not 
simultaneous for the observer in the train (figure 1).

                      Figure 1. At the initial instant, O and O’ are coincident 

  
As we have suggested in ref [34], Einstein’s definition is only appropriate if 
the  sources  of  light  are  firmly  fixed  to  the  reference  frame  in  which  the 
measurement  is  carried  out.  In  the  aforementioned  example,  if  the  light  is 
emitted by two lamps attached to the embankment, the definition will be true 
for  the  embankment  and  not  for  the  train  and  conversely.  Indeed,  Einstein 
himself recognizes that the light coming from B must cover a shorter path to 
reach O’ than the light coming from A. But the definition is only valid if the 
light covers the same path in both directions.  

(Note  that  the  Earth  also  moves  with  respect  to  the  train,  and  the 

embankment has no privileged status with respect to the train). 

In  order  to  correctly  reason,  we  must  bear  in  mind  that  simultaneous 
reception  does  not  necessarily  imply  simultaneous  emission  and  conversely. 
Hence, to accurately define simultaneity (if one assumes the invariance of the 
speed of light) we must specify the following points: 

Two  instantaneous  events,  occurring  at  two  points  A  and  B  and  emitting 
light in opposite directions toward a point O which is the middle of A B at the 
beginning  of  the  experiment,  can  be  considered  simultaneous  if  the  light 
issuing  from  A  and  B  reaches  point  O  at  the  same  instant,  provided  that  O 
remains fixed with respect to A and B all through the experiment.  

We must add that this definition is exact, only if the speed of light is equal 
in  both  directions.  In  the  fundamental  aether  theory  the  definition  is 
considered  exact  in  the  aether  frame  and  not  in  other  frames,  since  in  those 
frames the one-way speed of light is not isotropic. 

We will now propose another definition of simultaneity that is valid when 

point O’ moves with respect to points A and B. 

Let us reconsider to this end the example of the train and the embankment 
just seen (see fig 2). Contrary to ref [34] we will not suppose a priori that the 
speed of light is identical in the opposite directions, so we will designate the 
speed of light in the two reverse directions CAB and CBA. Let us place at A, O 
and B three clocks perfectly synchronous. 

10 

At the initial instant, O coincides with O’. At this very instant two signals 
are sent from A and B in opposite directions. When the signal coming from A 

reaches point O, point O’ has moved towards B of a distance equal to

where C is the speed of light in the fundamental frame. 
 
2 - Note that in this example, tAO’ and tBO’ are the real times given by the 
clocks  attached  to  the  privileged  frame.  As  a  result  of  clock  retardation,  the 
reading of the clocks in the train would be different. But this would not affect 
our  reasoning  and  our  conclusions  regarding  the  absolute  character  of 
simultaneity.  The  same  remark  can  be  done  about  the  length  contraction 
affecting the train. 

-  Here  is  another  example  that  will  confirm  this  absolute  character  of 

simultaneity. It will, without doubt, convince the wavering reader.  

Consider  two  rigid  collinear  rods  AB  and  A’B’  moving  in  opposite 
directions  uniformly,  along  the  same  line.  The  rods  are  assumed  to  have 
identical length when they are in motion with relative speed v. They are firmly 
attached respectively to reference frames S and S’ (see figure 3).

                   Figure 3. An example of the absoluteness of simultaneity 
     
     In A and B are placed two identical clocks perfectly synchronous. Another 
pair of such clocks are placed in A’ and B’. In order to reach A’, clock A must 
cover a distance D=AA’. This is also the case for B in direction of B’ (since 
BB’=AA’=D). Therefore, for an observer in frame S, the encounters between 
A  and  A’  and  between  B  and  B’  will  be  simultaneous.  But  an  observer  in 
frame  S’  will  draw  the  same  conclusion.  Hence  the  two  observers  conclude 
that  both  events  are  simultaneous.  (Note  that  this  does  not  imply  that  the 
clocks  in  frame  S  will  display  the  same  reading  as  those  in  frame  S’.  The 

 

 

12 

conclusion  concerns  simultaneity  and  not  the  clock  reading.  We  must 
distinguish between clock retardation and relativity of simultaneity). 

We  must  be  aware  that  an  apparent  relativity  of  simultaneity  exists.  It  is 
inherent in the Lorentz-Poincaré transformations and the extended space-time 
transformations  that  will  be  studied  later.  But  it  is  not  essential  and  results 
from the synchronism error entailed by the Einstein-Poincaré synchronization 
procedure  (or  by  the  slow  clock  transport  method).  These  methods  are  not 
ideal but they are the most simple and the most often used. 

After correction of the systematic measurement distortions entailed by these 

methods, the absolute character of simultaneity is found again. 

A  criterion  of  absolute  simultaneity  has  already  been  given  in  a  previous 
paper [32]: let two identical rubber balls bounce on the two pans of a precision 
balance; if the central pointer of the beam does not move, we can consider that 
the balls have bounced at the same instant, and this is true for all observers, at 
rest or in motion with respect to the balance, whether they are accelerated or 
not. (Of course, a small correction would be necessary, since there is probably 
a minute difference in the speed of propagation of the vibration along the two 
arms of the beam. But this is of no consequence since the correction would be 
identical for all the above-mentioned observers). Note also that the notion of 
four-dimensional  space-time  has  also  conventional  character  and  once   
synchronism  errors  are  corrected,  the  mixing  of  space  and  time  disappears. 
This claim will be demonstrated subsequently. (see also ref [35] and [32]). 

 

IV. Michelson’s experiment 

Michelson’s  experiment  can  be  easily  explained  by  means  of  Einstein’s 
Special  relativity:  the  two  arms  of  the  interferometer  being  equal,  and  the 
speed  of  light  constant,  the  transit  time  of  light  in  both  directions  must  be 
identical. Now, assuming that the speed of light is anisotropic, this approach 
becomes questionable. 

The  explanation  of  the  experiment  based  on  Lorentz’s  assumptions  is 
completely different. Let us suppose that at a moment in its journey, one of the 
arms  of  the  interferometer  moves  along  the  x-axis  of  a  co-ordinate  system  S 
attached to the cosmic substratum (aether). The other arm is aligned along the 
y’-axis  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  motion  of  a  coordinate  system  S’ 
attached to the Earth platform (see fig. 4). We will suppose that the experiment 
is carried out in vacuum. During a short instant, the motion of the Earth frame 
can be considered rectilinear and uniform: if this was not the case, we would

Michelson’s interferometer  

 
 

 

 

We will first consider the arm perpendicular to the direction of motion. 

From  the  point  of  view  of  an  observer  at  rest  in  frame  S’,  a  light  beam 
travelling  back  and  forth  along  the  arm  O’B,  covers  a  distance  2L;  but  from 
the point of view of an observer attached to reference frame S, the beam starts 
from A, is reflected in B, and then comes back to A’. (Where AA’ designates 
the distance covered by the interferometer during a cycle of the beam, see fig 
 = 
4β). Since the speed of light is constant in the substratum, we have: AB = 
CT, where T is the time needed to cover the distance AB. 

 > L one cannot have at the same time: 

Now,  from  the  classical  (Galilean)  viewpoint,  the  time  separating  two 
events  is  independent  of  the  frame  from  which  it  is  measured  and, 
consequently,  the  speed  of  light  must  be  lower  than  C  in  frame  S’.  Indeed, 
 = CT and L = CT. However, 
since 
the measurement of the speed of light gives C in all ‘inertial frames’. So there 
is a paradox. If we suppose that C = const, then, the time interval between the 
emission and the arrival of the beam must be different in the two frames, and 
we will have: 

 = CT and L = Ct. This is what special relativity asserts.

. So that 

Nevertheless, if one takes for granted the Lorentz assumptions, this result 
is  false.  The  real  value  of  the  speed  of  light  in  frame  S'  is  given 
by

v
C
(
How can we explain that we find C and not C'? In order to understand this, 
we  must  assume  that  the  motion  entails  a  slowing  down  of  the  clocks. 
Therefore, any measurement of the time in a frame moving with respect to the 
Cosmic Substratum will be different from the universal time. The relationship 
between the local (fictitious) time  t , and the real (universal) time T, is easily 
obtained from fig.4:

Therefore,  if  we  assume  the  Lorentz  postulates,  there  is  no  relativity  of 
time but rather a slowing down of the clocks which are moving with respect to 
the aether frame. The real two way transit time of light along the arm O’B is:

 Let  us  now  consider  the  arm  parallel  to  the  direction  of  motion.  The  time 
needed by the light signal to travel back and forth along this arm was expected 

to be:

it was different from (1). Yet, the fringe shift observed when one changes the 
orientation  of  the  interferometer  was  regarded  as  negligible  in  comparison 
with the shift expected. In order to explain this result, FitzGerald and Lorentz 
were compelled to postulate a contraction of the arm aligned along the x-axis,

its  length  being  equal  to:

Note  that,  insofar  as  the  anisotropy  of  the  one  way  speed  of  light  is  proved, 
length  contraction  is  no  longer  an  ad  hoc  hypothesis,  but  rather  a  necessary 
cause of Michelson’s result. 

 Now,  we  may  wonder  how  Lorentz's  theory  can  explain  that  the 
magnitude of the two-way speed of light along the x’-axis is always found to 

be C ? since:

and not C ! There are two reasons for this: 

1. The  meter  stick  used  to  measure  L  is  also  contracted,  so  we  cannot 
observe  the  contraction,  and  therefore  we  make  a  systematic  error  in 
measuring the arm. We find L in place of

2. As  we  have  seen  from  the  study  of  the  arm  O’B,  the  clocks  in  the

by  observer  S’  will  be  equal  to  the  time  noticed  by  S  multiplied  by

(Note  that  it  is  this  velocity  which  is  generally  identified  with  the  one-way 
speed of light). 
 
- Important remark 

It  is  essential  to  realize  that  C  is  not  the  real  one-way  speed  of  light  in 
frame S’. It is well known that measuring exactly the one-way speed of light 
presents  serious  difficulties,  since,  to  this  end,  we  generally  use  clocks 
synchronized  by  means  of  Poincaré-Einstein's  method,  (or  by  slow  clock 
transport). Indeed, suppose that we want to synchronize two clocks placed at 
two points O’ and Q, aligned along the x’-axis of frame S’. According to the 
Einstein-Poincaré  procedure,  we  send  a  light  signal  at  time 
from  O’  to  Q. 
After  reflection,  the  signal  returns  to  O’.  The  reading  of  the  clock  O’  at  this 
instant  is 
.  The  clocks  will  be  considered  synchronous  if  when  the 
signal reaches clock Q, the reading of this clock is 
. But, insofar as 
the one-way speed of light is anisotropic, the method introduces a systematic 
error. 
is not the one way transit time of light, it is the ‘apparent’ average 
transit time (measured with the retarded clocks attached to frame S’) that we 
app1τ (see later). We see that the method only permits determination

of  the  ‘apparent’  two-way  speed  of  light  along  the  x’-axis  (measured  with 
retarded clocks and contracted meter sticks).

As  we  have  seen,  and  as  we  shall  confirm  in  a  more  general  way  in  the 
following chapters, it is this velocity which is always found to be constant and 
equal to C (see also [1 or 31]). (Notice that, contrary to a common belief, the 
method of slow clock transport does not provide more accurate results than the 

16 

method  of  Einstein-Poincaré  [1,24]).  Both  methods  are  approximately 
equivalent.

necessary  here  to  derive  Einstein's  transformations.  This  has  been  done  by 
different  well-known  techniques.  On  the  other  hand,  the  derivation  of  the 
Lorentz-Poincaré  transformations  has  been  forgotten.  In  order  to  determine 
them,  we  use  a  mathematical  tool  which  makes  reference  to  Zeno.  The

reference  frame  not  submitted  to  accelerations.  In  all  other  cases  they  take  a 
different mathematical form. We shall study successively these different cases. 
 
V.1  Consider  first  the  reference  frames  S  and  S'  mentioned  above  (fig  5).  A 
long  rod  aligned  along  the  x-axis,  is  at  rest  in  frame  S'.  Let  us  name the 
length of the rod in frame S’ and 
 the relative speed between S and S’. At 
the initial instant 
, a light ray emanates from the common origin O,O’ and 
travels towards the end of the rod. The origin A of the rod AB coincides with 
O’.  (We  must  bear  in  mind  that  the  speed  of  light  is  equal  to  C  in  the 
substratum S, and different from C in all other frames).

So that, the total distance covered by the ray in frame S when it reaches the

and the important remark following the formula). This is also the case for the 
length:  since  the  rod  is  measured  with  a  contracted  meter  stick,  its  length  in 
frame S’ is erroneously found to be equal to L. Therefore, for observer S' the 
apparent time needed by the ray to reach the end of the rod is

Formula (10) is the expression used by Tangherlini [12] and Mansouri and

The  above  transformations  (6)  to  (9),  look  compatible  with  the  relativity 
principle,  and  imply  reciprocity  of  observations  (apparent).  But  for  Lorentz, 
there is no real reciprocity. For example, the rods at rest in the substratum do 
not  contract.  The  apparent  reciprocity  results  from  the  impossibility  of 
synchronizing  exactly  the  clocks  in  S'  by  means  of  the  usual  methods.  This 
apparent reciprocity has been demonstrated by Prokhovnik [8]. It was used as 
an  argument  to  prove  that  the  aether  of  Lorentz  is  compatible  with  the 
principle of relativity. Nevertheless, the argument is not sufficient since it has 
been  applied  to  a  particular  case.  Indeed,  in  the  example  we  have  just 
considered, one of the frames is at rest in the Cosmic Substratum. 

 
V.2 Let us now study a different case: as figure 6 shows, it deals with two 
‘inertial frames’ S1 and S2, receding from the fundamental frame S0 along the 
common  x-axis.  (This  case  is  important  because  it  is  the  case  generally 
observed in practice). 

             

                                                    

 

Figure 6. Both reference frames S1 and S2 are in motion with respect to the aether 
frame S0.At the initial instant, the origin of the three frames 0, 0’and 0”are 
coincident. When the signal coming from the common origin reaches point B, it 
meets a mirror firmly attached to frame S1.   

The relative speeds between the frames are

02v
aligned  along  the  common  x-axis,  which  measures 

01v

 and 

12v

. A long rod AB 
(when  it  is  at  rest  in 

frame  S

initial 
zero, the origins O, O’ and O” of the three reference frames and the

20 

origin  A  of  the  rod  are  coincident.  At  this  very  instant,  a  light  ray  emanates 
from this common origin, and travels along the x-axis towards point B. When 
the signal reaches point B, it meets a mirror firmly attached to reference frame 
S1.  The  distance  between  O’  and  the  mirror  is  therefore  constant.  After 
reflection,  the  signal  comes  back  to  O'.  As  we  have  seen  (formulas  (3) 
and (4)), for observer S0 the time needed by the signal to reach point B is

According to Lorentz, this time is the real transit time of the signal. Now, 

let us determine the apparent transit time measured by observer S1.  

Assuming that the speed of light is 

transit time 
space co-ordinate. We can see that, when the ray has covered in S
equal to , reference frame S

 in S2, the real 
 from O' to B, can be easily obtained. Let us first determine the

V.3 Transformations of space and time for bodies moving uniformly at 

speeds lower than the speed of light. 

Consider the three ‘inertial frames’ previously mentioned and let a vehicle 
coming  from  the
  by  the 
x−   direction,  pass  at  the  initial  instant 
common  origin  (O,  O’,  O’’)  (Figure  7).  The  vehicle  travels  uniformly  along 
the  rod  AB  toward  point  B.  At  the  initial instant, point A coincides with the 
common origin.

mirror  firmly  attached  to  frame  S

distances  covered  by  the  vehicle  in  frames  S1  and  S2  and  the  transit  times 
measured  by  the  observers  standing  in  these  frames  by  means  of  the  usual 
methods of measurement.

The  real  distance

obtained: indeed, the ratio of the distances covered in frames S1 and S2 is equal 
to the ratio of the speeds with respect to these two frames. That is:

reach point B, we must beforehand synchronize the clocks O’ and

of  light.  In  reality,  it  is  the  ‘apparent’  average  transit  time  of  light

This time is the universal time that clocks would display if they were at rest

clock retardation). 

But  in  frame  S1  we  must  take  account  of  the  synchronism  discrepancy 
effect  and  of  clock  retardation,  so  that  the  experimental  apparent  time 
obtained when we use the method of Poincaré-Einstein is:

Expressions  (20)  and  (21)  are  the  extended  space  time  transformations, 
applicable  to  any  pair  of  ‘inertial  bodies’  receding  uniformly  with  respect  to 
one  another  along  the  direction  of  motion  of  the  solar  system.  It  should  be 
pointed  out  that  during  a  brief  interval  of  time,  the  motion  of  the  Earth  with 
respect to the Cosmic Substratum can be considered rectilinear and uniform. If 
this were not the case, the bodies placed on its surface would be subjected to 
perceptible accelerations. 

With respect to the absolute motion of the sun, the orbital and the rotational 
motions of the Earth are slow. So, as a first approximation and during a short 
time,  the  motion  of  the  Earth  can  be  identified  with  the  motion  of  the  solar 
system. This means that S1 can be identified with the Earth frame, and S2 with 
a vehicle moving on its surface in the direction of motion of the Solar system 
is  the  real  speed  of  the  Earth  with 
(a  ship  for  example).  Accordingly, 
01v
respect  to  the  Cosmic  Substratum  S
02v   is  the  real  speed  of  the  ship  with 
0, 
respect to S0. 

V is the real speed, with respect to S0, of a body present on the surface of

the  ship  and  moving  in  the  same  direction,  and 

appV1

the body with respect to the Earth frame. 

(Formula  (21)  is  identical  to  the  expression  of  the  space  transformation 
which  was  given  in  a  previous  publication  [36].  Formula  (20)  represents  a 
completely satisfactory expression of the time transformation: it applies to all 
values of V. It replaces the expression given in [36] which was limited to high 
values of V).

Coherence of the derivation 
The  coherence  of  the  derivation  can  be  checked.  To  this  end,  we  need  to 
demonstrate its agreement with known experimental data. The equations must 
reduce to the Lorentz-Poincaré transformations when 
  and  they  must 
explain why the experimental measurement of the speed of light by the usual 
methods, always gives C. 
We note that when
v =
01

1 and S2 which were coincident at 
the initial instant, always remain coincident. We are brought back to the case 
of two ‘inertial frames’, one of them being at rest in the Cosmic Substratum 
(aether  frame),  see  below.  In  this  case,  as  expected,  Δ is  reduced  to

VI. Variation of mass with speed in relativity and in the fundamental 
aether theory.  

In the present chapter, we propose to test the coherence of special relativity 
in  the  field  of  dynamics,  such  as  the  laws  are  assumed,  without  calling  into 
question a priori the compatibility of the relativity principle with mass-energy 
conservation, a question which will be tackled in the following chapter. 

28 

In relativity, since no absolute frame exists, the mass of a body attached to 
any given inertial frame, viewed by an observer at rest in this frame, is always 
regarded as identical. This mass is defined as the proper mass or the rest mass 
of the body. 

If the body moves with respect to a frame S with velocity v, its mass with 

respect to S is assumed to be:

 appears not to have changed, which is inexact). 
     As  we  have  seen  in  the  previous  chapters  and  in  [1,  35,  39],  contrary  to 
what is often claimed, the existence of a fundamental frame is not compatible 
with the exact application of the relativity principle.

  be 
respectively  at  rest  in  these  three  frames.  The  said  masses  were  initially 
identical  in  reference  frame  S
,  before  being  transported  in 
their respective reference frame. We propose to examine the effect of motion 
on these masses (see figure 8).

     VI.2  Point of view of the fundamental aether theory 

In our book “Relativité et Substratum Cosmique [37]”, the results that will 
follow  were  seen  as  a  stumbling  block  for  the  fundamental  aether  theory, 
because they lead to an expression for kinetic energy different from the usual 
expression.  Nevertheless,  objections  to  the  application  of  the  relativity 
principle  and  present  day  arguments  in  favour  of  the  aether  and  of  the 
anisotropy  of  the  one-way  speed  of  light  compel  us  to  reassess  our  earlier 
point of view. 

Let us now go back to the figure with the three bodies, and suppose that S0 
is the fundamental inertial frame, and S1 and S2 two ‘inertial frames’ aligned 
with S0.

It  is  the  case  of  particles  moving  at  high  speed  with  respect  to  the  Earth 
frame,  (while  the  Earth  moves  with  respect  to  the  fundamental  frame  at  low 
speed (≅ 350 km/sec)). In such cases the Earth can be considered as almost at 
rest with respect to the fundamental frame. So the relativistic approach and the 
fundamental approach lead to practically equivalent results. 

     VI.3  The question of reciprocity. 

This  question  makes  a  great  difference  between  relativity  and  the 
fundamental aether theory. According to relativity, when a body is transported 
from one inertial system S0, to another S1, viewed from S0 its mass is supposed 
to be

also appear equal to

, indeed we have been compelled to supply energy to the body in 
order  to  move  it  from  S
0  to  S1,  but  if  the  body  returns  to  S0,  the  energy  is 
restored. All observers (including the observer of frame S1) will conclude that 
the real mass is equal to

. 0m

This  result  is  in  total  contradiction  with  relativity,  but  it  is  the  only  result 

which is in accordance with mass-energy conservation. 

Important remark.  
In  the  fundamental  aether  theory,  we  must  distinguish  the  total  available 
 and the 
energy of a body (which is equal to the sum of the rest energy 
kinetic  energy  with  respect  to  the  fundamental  frame),  from  the  available 
energy of the body with respect to any other inertial frame, which is smaller 
than the previous energy, and takes another mathematical form.

VII. Inferences from the aether theory 

 Some of the topics treated here had been partly tackled in previous 

publications. Yet the reader will find some additional explanations in response 
to the questions asked to the author. 

       The relativity principle 
        The idea of relativity has played an important role in the development of 
contemporary  physics.  Indeed,  it  has  been  used  successfully  by  Galileo  to 
refute  some  dogmas  of  Aristotelian  physics.  The  arguments  of  Galileo 
appeared  so  convincing  that  the  idea  has,  in  turn,  acquired  the  status  of  an 
irrefutable dogma. In the light of the new data presented in this manuscript, it 
is appropriate to go through its conceptual content, once more. 

Aristotelian physics considered motion and rest as absolute and completely 
distinct,  the  Earth,  in  a  state  of  absolute  rest,  occupying  the  centre  of  the 
Universe.  Galileo  departed  completely  from  this  attitude.  For  him,  uniform 
motion  presented  no  absolute  character.  Any  object  at  rest  with  respect  to  a 
given reference system is, at the same time, in motion with respect to another 
reference  system;  rest  and  motion  are  not  fundamentally  different,  they  have 
only relative character.  
     As an example of his relativity principle, Galileo cited the case of a stone 
released from the top of a ship’s mast, as the ship sails uniformly in a straight 
line.  If,  according  to  Galileo,  motion  had  an  absolute  character,  the  stone 
would fall at a distance from the foot of the mast. But the stone falls at the foot 
of the mast, a result he interpreted as due to the fact that the ship is at rest in its 
inertial system. 

Although the argument of Galileo demonstrated the acuteness of his critical 
judgment, we must be aware that the knowledge, in his time, could not allow 
him  to  study  the  problem  from  all  its  sides.  His  argument  is  in  fact 
questionable. Indeed, the stone has momentum  mv parallel to the direction of 
motion  of  the  ship,  and  the  fact  that  it  is  released  does  not  eliminate  this 
momentum which constrains it to continue its horizontal motion along with the 
ship,  while  its  vertical  motion  is  determined  by  the  law  of  gravitation. 

34 

Therefore, even if motion and rest present an absolute character, the stone will 
still fall at the foot of the mast. 

(Note that our reasoning is entirely exact only in the ideal case where the 
motion  of  the  ship  is  rectilinear  and  uniform,  and  where  air  resistance  is 
negligible.  To  be  rigorous  we  should  also  take  account  of  the  resistance 
opposed by the substratum. But in the present example this resistance would 
be very small). 

The fact remains that it is to Galileo’s credit that the meaning of motion is 
clearly understood. Contrary to Aristotle’s belief, Galileo demonstrated that if 
motion  needs  a  motor  to  be  produced,  it  does  not  need  a  motor  to  be 
maintained. 
      -Galilean relativity principle was limited to the laws of mechanics and to 
bodies  moving  at  low  speeds.  Poincaré’s  purpose  was  to  extend  it  to  all  the 
laws  of  physics  and  in  particular  to  Maxwell’s  electromagnetism.  Indeed, 
these laws seemed to be an exception to the rule. 

In  order  to  bring  them  back  into  line,  Poincaré  had  to  resort  to  a  set  of 
equations he baptised Lorentz transformations, which should assume a group 
structure. 

Poincaré expressed his principle in the following terms: “It seems that the 
impossibility of observing the absolute motion of the Earth is a general law of 
nature. We are naturally inclined to admit this law that we shall call relativity 
postulate, and to admit it without restriction [38]”. 

This  sentence  does  not  imply  dismissal  of  absolute  motion  but  rather  the 
impossibility  of  observing  it.  However,  on  another  occasion,  Poincaré 
declared:  “there  is  no  absolute  space;  all  the  motions  we  can  observe  are 
relative motions [38]”. 

Nevertheless,  Poincaré  did  not  reject  the  aether.  His  acceptance  of  this 

medium is expressed in the following terms: 

“Does  an  aether  really  exist?  The  reason  why  we  believe  in  an  aether  is 
simple: if light comes from a distant star and takes many years to reach us, it 
is,  during  its  travel,  no  longer  on  the  star,  but  not  yet  near  the  Earth. 
Nevertheless it must be somewhere and supported by a material medium” (La 
science et l’hypothèse, chapter 10, p 180 of the French edition “Les theories de 
la physique moderne”.)  

During a lecture given in Lille (France) in 1909 [38] Poincaré declared: 
“Let  us  remark  that  an  isolated  electron  moving  through  the  aether 
generates an electric current, that is to say an electromagnetic field. This field 

35 

corresponds to a certain quantity of energy localized in the aether rather than 
in the electron. 

Poincaré acknowledged his debt to Lorentz in the following terms: 
“The  results  I  have  obtained  agree  with  those  of  Mr.  Lorentz  in  all 
important  points.  I  was  led  to  modify  and  complete  them  in  a  few  points  of 
detail.” 

Therefore Poincaré tried to reconcile the Lorentz aether with relativity. 
Poincaré’s point of view cannot be maintained. We have demonstrated this 
in  the  example  of  two  vehicles  moving  in  opposite  directions  towards  two 
symmetrical  targets  (see  end  of  chapter  II  of  this  text).  In  addition,  since 
Poincaré assumes length contraction, a rod in motion with respect to the aether 
frame will shrink when its orientation will be changed (from the perpendicular 
to the parallel direction of motion). Of course we will not be able to measure 
this  contraction  with  a  meter  stick,  since  the  stick  also  shrinks  in  the  same 
ratio.  But,  at  high  speed,  the  process  will  be  observable  and  will  inform  us 
about the absolute motion of the rod. (Note also that, with four meter sticks in 
motion at high speed, two of them being parallel to the direction of motion and 
two others perpendicular, we will construct a rectangle instead of a square). 

So,  contrary  to  Poincaré’s  view,  the  aether  of  Lorentz  is  not  compatible 

with the exact applicability of the relativity principle in the physical world 

Here, it is important to specify that we don’t contest the relativity principle 
as an abstract concept. Indeed, if frames were not under the influence of any 
physical  forces,  the  relativity  principle  would  strictly  apply.  But  insofar  as 
there is an aether drift whose magnitude varies as a function of their absolute 
speed the frames, cannot be perfectly inertial and they are not equivalent for 
the description of the physical laws. Therefore, the relativity principle cannot 
exactly apply. It is reduced to an approximation valid when the aether drift is 
weak, that is when v/c<<1. Note nevertheless that the laws of physics should 
hardly vary when two frames move with respect to one another at low speeds 
(v/c<<1). 
     -In  its  original  formulation  of  1905  [6],  unlike  Poincaré’s  approach, 
Einstein’s  relativity  principle  dismisses  the  aether  hypothesis.  The  postulate 
can be expressed as follows: “All the ‘inertial frames’ are equivalent. The laws 
of  nature,  including  those  of  electromagnetism,  take  the  same  form  in  all  of 
them”. 

The  arguments  in  favour  of  an  aether  drift  developed  in  the  previous  and 
following chapters of the present text are not compatible with the concept of 
relativity developed by Einstein. 

36 

-Until now we have tested the consistency of special relativity in the field 
of  dynamics  as  the  laws  are  assumed,  but  without  calling  into  question  the 
compatibility  of  the  relativity  principle  with  mass-energy  conservation  and 
with the existence of mass, a question which will be tackled here. 

  Generally speaking, Galileo’s relativity idea (as well as those of Poincaré 
and  Einstein  which  derive  from  it)  cannot  be  accepted  without  restrictions 
because  it  implies  reciprocity  and  this  is  in  contradiction  with  mass-energy 
conservation.  Indeed,  if  the  relativity  principle  did  exactly  apply  in  the 
physical  world,  the  aether  should  exert  an  identical  influence  on  all  ‘inertial 
systems’* or no influence at all, because if this were not the case, the physical 
laws would appear in all cases different in two frames S0 and S. (This notion 
appears implicit in the modern approaches of the aether).  

This kind of aether should offer no resistance to motion because if such a 
resistance did exist, it would be of different magnitude in the different frames, 
depending on their relative speed, in contradiction with the relativity principle. 
The conventional concept of kinetic energy assumed by relativity is closely 
linked  to  the  relativity  principle  and  to  the  assumed  absence  of  aether  drift; 
indeed  insofar  as  there  is  no  preferred  frame,  the  kinetic  energy  has  no 
absolute character, it is observer dependent. The following examples will put 
forward some of the paradoxes raised by this concept of kinetic energy. 

 Let us consider the case of a vehicle that travels from one ‘inertial frame’ 
S0  to  another  S.  A  part  of  its  fuel  provides  the  chemical  energy  k  which  is 
converted in kinetic energy. According to relativity, for an observer attached 
to  frame  S0,  when  the  vehicle  reaches  frame  S,  its  kinetic  energy  has 
increased,  but  viewed  by  the  observer  attached  to  frame  S,  it  has  decreased. 
However, if chemical energy has been converted into kinetic energy during the 
travel,  this  must  be  true  for  all  observers.  This  energy  is  not  dependent  on 
which  one  measures  it.  Chemical  energy  cannot  give  rise  to  a  decrease  of 
kinetic  energy  because,  in  such  a  case,  the  mass-energy  conservation  law 
would be transgressed. 

 (We  must  add  that,  for  the  observer  S,  the  part  of  chemical  energy  k 
mentioned above could not be converted in heat and exhaust energy, because 

                                                 
* This is what Einstein means when in the conclusion of his book Ether and relativity he claims… this 
ether may not be thought as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting 
of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it. A Einstein,

no aether drift. This kind of aether does not offer resistance to motion. 

37 

heat and exhaust energy relate to the environment and not to the vehicle, and 
the two observers cannot draw opposite conclusions). 

Such  a  paradox  results  from  the  fact  that  the  kinetic  energy  of  a  body  in 
relativity  is  regarded  as  observer  dependent.  Indeed,  the  relativity  principle 
assumes  that  there  is  no  preferred  frame  in  which  a  body  at  rest  has  zero 
kinetic energy and from which the kinetic energy should be measured. If one 
assumes  that  the  relativity  principle  applies  in  the  physical  world,  a  body  is 
viewed as having zero kinetic energy by any observer at rest in the same frame 
as  the  body  and,  therefore,  there  is  no  storage  of  a  well  defined  amount  of 
kinetic energy when a body moves from one inertial frame to another.  

There is no paradox any more if we consider that the total available kinetic 
energy  is  defined  with  respect  to  a  privileged  aether  frame  in  which  the 
absolute speed of any body at rest is zero. In this case, the total kinetic energy 
of a moving body has a well defined value and is not observer dependent. In 
the previous example, the increase of kinetic energy in the transfer from frame 
S0 to frame S would be absolute and recognized as the same by all observers. 
Conversely, in the transfer from S to S0, the decrease would be recognized as 
the same by all. This implies that rest and motion are not only relative and that 
absolute speeds do exist.  

We shall now present another example in which the paradoxes generated by 
the absence of aether drift and the existence of perfect inertial frames will be 
disclosed. To this end we shall make use of the criterion expressed in the first 
example which is required by logic, and we shall reason by contradiction. This 
topic which had already been tackled in ref [1], will be studied here in greater 
detail. 

Let us suppose that a spaceship leaves S0 and, after acceleration, reaches a 
constant speed v and becomes firmly attached to frame S. To this end, suppose 
that it has used an amount of fuel F capable of supplying the energy W, where 
W  is  the  sum  of  the  kinetic  energy  k  and  the  heat  and  exhaust  energy  h,        
(W = k + h). We assume that the mass of the fuel is negligible compared to the 
mass of the spaceship. In S, the fuel tank is filled up again with a mass of fuel 
equal  to  F.  If  the  frames  S0  and  S  were  perfectly  inertial  (equivalent),  they 
would only be distinguished from one another by their relative speed v. This 
means that, if there were no aether drift, no difference could be observed in the 
physical properties of the transfers from S to S0 and from S0 to S. Therefore, in 
order to come back to S0, the spaceship should use the same amount of fuel as 
it  does  going  from  S0  to  S,  a  fact  at  the  origin  of  the  paradox.  An  observer 
standing  in  frame  S  should  note  that  the  chemical  energy  used  in  the  transit 

38 

from S to S0 is W = k + h, the same as in the reverse direction. Assuming that 
v/c<<1,  the  observers  in  both  frames  should  agree  on  that,  and  for  the  same 
reasons, they should agree on the fact that the amount of fuel which was to be 
converted into kinetic energy had to be the same in the two reverse directions. 
And this would be true no matter what point in S0 the spaceship reaches upon 
its return. (Indeed, a body at rest with respect to a given ‘inertial frame’ has a 
well-defined mass-energy whatever its position may be in this ‘inertial frame’. 
This mass-energy is equal to the sum of the internal mass-energy of the body 
and its kinetic energy which is the same in any position in the ‘inertial

frame’

Therefore,  the  spaceship  would  have  used  an  amount  of  fuel  equal  to  2F 
corresponding to the energy 2k + 2h to leave and to recover its initial state in 
frame S0. The heat and exhaust energy is conserved since it is released in the 
environment but, obviously, the kinetic energy is not since, with the assumed 
hypotheses, a part of the fuel has been used to this end while the final kinetic 
energy has not increased. And there would be no conservation of mass-energy. 
(Note that we have ignored the variation of mass with speed which, for v<<c 
is  negligible.  In  any  case,  in  this  problem,  it  has  no  consequences  on  the 
conclusion  drawn  since,  with  the  questionable  hypotheses  assumed,  the 
amount  of  fuel  used  to  be  converted  in  kinetic  energy  is  not  null,  while  the 
final kinetic energy is obviously unchanged.) 

Thus,  mass-energy  conservation,  which  is  one  of  the  most  basic 
assumptions  in  physics,  excludes  the  exact  application  of  the  relativity 
principle  in  the  physical  world.  The  origin  and  the  resolution  of  the  paradox 
will be explained later. 

The point of view of the fundamental aether theory is completely different. 
Here there is no complete equivalence of frames S0 and S. From S0 to S a part 
of  the  fuel  must  be  converted  into  kinetic  energy  and  from  S  to  S0  the 
spaceship must restore this same energy to the environment as a form of heat. 
As a result, the mass-energy conservation law will be obeyed. The situation is 
similar  to  that  of  a  body  which  acquires  potential  energy  E  when  it  moves 
from  one  level  A,  to  another  B.  Upon  its  return,  the  body  must  restore  the 
same energy E. 

But  this  implies  that  S0  and  S  experience  a  different  influence  from  the 
substratum. We can conclude that the substratum offers resistance to motion, 

                                                 
** Of course this last statement applies exactly only in an ideal inertial frame where there is no gravity 
and where the motion of the frame is strictly rectilinear and uniform. 

39 

which increases with absolute velocity and which will be higher in S than in 
S0. 

A consequence of this fact is that the principle of inertia cannot rigorously 

apply (see later). 

For the same reason, the total relativistic momentum of particles interacting 

in a collision cannot be exactly the same before and after the collision. 

Furthermore, the relativity principle implies that the mass-energy available 
of a body A, at rest with respect to an ‘inertial frame’ S, is not well defined. It 
has  only  relative  value  with  respect  to  another  body  B,  and  if  the  speed  of 
body B tends towards the speed of light, the kinetic energy of A with respect 
to  B  will  tend  toward  infinity.  This  is  untenable.  The  total  available  mass-
energy of a body is finite and is defined with respect to the fundamental frame. 
It is absurd to consider that it depends on the speed of another body. 
     We must conclude that the relativity principle is an abstract concept which 
cannot  exactly  apply  in  the  physical  world.  It  nevertheless  remains  that  the 
uniform motion of a given reference frame is imperceptible for an observer at 
rest  in  this  frame.  But  this  does  not  result  from  the  fact  that  only  relative 
speeds  have  a  meaning  (and  from  the  Galilean  idea  that  motion  is  like 
nothing). Uniform absolute speed is not perceived precisely because it remains 
unchanged  all  the  time;  in  other  words,  because  the  energy  of  the  body  in 
motion is not modified. 
 
    On the origin of mass 

As we have seen, the relativity principle implies that two identical bodies, 
attached  to  any  two  ‘inertial  systems’  S1  and  S2,  assume  a  completely 
symmetrical situation and therefore possess the same energy status.  

If  a  spaceship  needs  to  use  fuel  to  move  from  S1  to  S2,  assuming  that 
v/c<<1, it will also use the same amount of fuel to move from S2 to S1. If we 
suppose that the energy used is h + k it would have used energy 2h + 2k on a 
round  trip  while,  paradoxically,  its  final  kinetic  energy  would  not  have 
increased and the energy will not be conserved. In order for the energy to be 
conserved, it should move from S1 to S2 (or from S2 to S1) without changing 
its kinetic energy. Such a paradoxical result can be easily explained when we 
know that in the absence of aether drift, there is no hierarchy between inertial 
frames.   

Therefore, assuming that the rest mass is

 On  the  contrary,  the  fundamental  aether  theory  implies  a  different 
influence  of  the  substratum  on  S1  and  S2.  Designating  as  v1  the  speed  of  S1 
with respect to the aether frame S0 and v2 the speed of S2 with respect to S0, 
the kinetic energy acquired by the body when it moves from S1 to S2   will be:

bodies, which implies that the exact applicability of the relativity principle in 
the physical world is incompatible with the existence of mass.

      Mass-energy conservation 

      This law must be viewed as unquestionable, because mass or energy 
cannot arise from nothing and, conversely, they cannot be destroyed. 
Nevertheless, in processes where mass or energy are exchanged, we must take 
account of the fact that the aether can absorb or supply part of the energy. 

      Principle of inertia 
      In a previous paper [35], we declared that any objection to the applicability 
of  the  relativity  principle,  also  challenges  the  principle  of  inertia.  It  is 
important here to give further information in order to specify what we mean. 
In  its  original  formulation,  the  principle  was  expressed  in  concrete  terms,  “a 
marble sliding on a perfectly smooth horizontal surface (without any friction) 
in vacuum, remains perpetually in its state of motion”. 

Of  course,  if,  in  agreement  with  the  Galilean  relativity  principle,  rest  and 
uniform motion are only relative, we can consider that the marble is at rest in 
its reference system and, as a consequence, it must remain in this state of rest. 

But,  in  the  fundamental  aether  theory  proposed  here,  absolute  rest  exists 
and  is  distinct  from  motion.  The  difference  results  from  the  existence  of  the 

41 

aether.  Under  the  action  of  the  aether,  the  marble  will  experience  a  gradual 
slowing  down,  hardly  perceptible,  but  not  null.  The  Galilean  principle  of 
inertia is therefore called into question. 

Now,  in  its  modern  sense,  the  principle  of  inertia  can  be  expressed  as:  “a 
body  not  subjected  to  any  physical  force  remains  perpetually  in  its  state  of 
motion”. 

If  we  assume  this  more  precise  definition,  the  principle  of  inertia  appears 
essentially  correct.  Indeed,  the  aether should  exert  a  pressure,  very  weak  but 
which increases with absolute velocity, on the body, causing the body to slow 
down. If this pressure were balanced, the body would effectively remain in its 
state of motion. This condition appears necessary in order for the law of mass-
energy conservation to be obeyed. 
 
    Speed of light invariance and Lorentz-FitzGerals’s contraction 
    This  question  has  been  extensively  studied  in  ref  [1].  The  new  significant 
results published since the publication of this book will be briefly expounded 
here. 
    We  are  indebted  to  Builder  and  Prokhovnik  [8],  for  having  demonstrated 
that,  assuming  the  anisotropy  of  the  one-way  speed  of  light  and  length 
contraction,  the  two-way  transit  time  of  light  2T  along  a  rod  attached  to  the 
Earth frame is isotropic. In other words, this time is independent of the angle 
separating the rod and the x0,,x-axis of any co-ordinate system attached to the 
Earth frame. The value obtained by these authors was indeed,

where 
  is  the  length  assumed  by  the  rod  when  it  is  at  rest  in  the  aether 
frame, and v, the speed of the Earth with respect to this privileged frame. In 
fact  in  a  recent  paper,  Cahill  and  Kitto  [27],  claimed  that  perfect  isotropy  is 
observed  only  in  vacuum.  The  Michelson-Morley  experiments  carried  out  in 
air  or  in  gas  allow  detection  of  a  fringe  shift  which  until  now  has  been 
considered  as  experimental  error  and  then  ignored.  The  magnitude  of  the 
aether drift deduced from the shift by the classical authors was of the order of 
8  Km/sec  in  air.  According  to  Cahill  and  Kitto  this  result  is  inexact.  The 
authors declared “It is essential in analysing data, to correct for the refractive 
index  effect”.  If  the  data  from  gas  mode  interferometers  are  analysed  using 
Lorentz-FitzGerald’s contraction, the aether drift is found to be of the order of          

42 

365 Km/sec, in good agreement with the result deduced from the anisotropy of 
the 2.7°K microwave background radiation.  
It is too early to draw conclusion from the article of these authors, but if the 
work is confirmed, it will provide another weighty argument in favour of the 
aether. 
The  demonstration  carried  out  by  Builder  and  Prokhovnik  remains  highly 
meaningful, yet, in the light of the new data, the two-way transit time of light 
along a rod would be perfectly isotropic only in the vacuum. 
We must add that, contrary to what these authors asserted, 2T is not the two-
way transit time of light measured with clocks attached to the Earth frame; on 
the  contrary  the  measurement  does  not  take  account  of  clock  retardation        
[1, 31]. Indeed, if this was not the case, the ‘apparent’ two-way speed of light 
in vacuum along the rod would not be found constant and of magnitude C. 
Let us demonstrate this point. Notice first that when we measure the length of 
the  rod  in  a  moving  frame,  (i,  e,  different  from  the  aether  frame)  we  do  not 
find its real length. Since the meter stick used to measure it is also contracted, 
the length found is its rest length
Therefore, if Prokhovnik’s claim was true, we would find for the speed of light 
in the Earth frame:

Since  in  reality,  2T  is  the  two-way  transit  time  of  light  that  clocks  would 
display if they were attached to the aether frame, the measurement in the Earth

This result also corresponds to the apparent one-way speed of light, since as 
demonstrated  in  [1]  all  the  attempts  to  measure  this  velocity  with  clocks 
synchronized by means of the Einstein-Poincaré procedure, or by slow clock 
transport, only enable in fact to measure the apparent two-way speed of light. 
    
    VIII. Conclusion 

Starting  from  the  Galilean  transformations  and  assuming  the  postulates  of 
Lorentz,  we  have  obtained  a  set  of  transformations  applicable  to  any  pair  of 

43 

‘inertial  bodies’  aligned  along  the  direction  of  motion  of  the  solar  system. 
They take a different form from the of Lorentz-Poincaré transformations. 

In  order  to  derive  them,  we  were  compelled  to  modify  the  Galilean 
transformations by taking account of the systematic measurement distortions. 
The  extended  space-time  transformations  obtained  in  this  way  are  the 
experimental relations. Conversely, they must be corrected in order to obtain 
transformations  when  no 
the  Galilean  relations,  which  are 
measurement distortions are present.

(Of course this implies that when a body A moves at speed v with respect to 
a system of co-ordinates attached to the aether frame, the real speed relative to 
A  of  another  body  B  moving  along  the  direction  OA  will  be  limited  to              
v’ < C – v ) 

The extended space-time transformations derived in this text are equivalent 
to  the  inertial  transformations  derived  by  F.  Selleri  [11];  nevertheless,  they 
take  a  different  mathematical  form,  since  the  synchronization  procedures 
utilized  here  are  the  usual  procedures.  F.  Selleri  makes  use  of  the  absolute 
synchronization  procedure  of  Mansouri  and  Sexl  [13]  which  is  ideal,  but 
should be really difficult to apply. In addition, we demonstrate that the inertial 
transformations  conceal  hidden  variables  which  are  nothing  else  than  the 
Galilean transformations ([see ref 1]). 

The  derivation  is  demonstrated  to  be  consistent,  since  the  extended 
transformations  reduce  to  the  Lorentz-Poincaré  transformations  when  one  of 
the  frames  under  consideration  is  the  fundamental  inertial  frame.  They  also 
explain why the ‘apparent’ (measured) velocity of light is found to be constant 
(although,  after  correction  of  the  systematic  measurement  distortions,  they 
show  that  the  real  one-way  velocity  of  light  is  constant  exclusively  in  the 
fundamental aether frame.) 

These extended space-time transformations do contradict the application of 
the relativity principle in the physical world. Yet this does not disprove them, 
since, as we saw, while the principle can be used as a good approximation in 
the  cases  we  have  mentioned,  it  cannot  be  applied  to  all  experimental 
situations (see also [1, 35]).  

We must add that, insofar as the substratum interacts with the bodies or the 
particles present in a physical process, the laws of conservation would exactly 
apply only if this interaction was taken into account. At low speed with respect 
to the aether frame, the effect is certainly imperceptible, but this should not be 
the case when the particles move at speeds close to the speed of light.  

44 

     As  we  have  seen,  the  aether  hypothesis  enables  to  account  for  several 
fundamental questions that had never found a satisfactory explanation before.

M. Allais, L’anisotropie de l’espace (Clement Juglar, Paris 1997) 750 pages. 
The  author  comments  on  experiments  he  performed  with  a  paraconic 
pendulum which, according to him, demonstrated the anisotropy of space. He 
also refers to the experiments of Miller and Esclangon, which lead to identical 
conclusions. 
Miller repeated the experiments of Michelson and Morley a number of times 
and concluded: “...Since the theory of relativity postulates an exact null effect 
from  the  aether  drift  experiment  which  had  never  been  obtained  in  fact,  the 
writer  felt  impelled  to  repeat  the  experiment  in  order  to  secure  a  definitive 
result.” (L’anisotropie de l’espace, p 383.) 
Allais notes (p. 405 of his book note 9 and p. 581 note 2) that “it is erroneous 
to  repeat  that  the  experiments  of  Michelson  and  Morley  of  1887  gave  a 
completely negative result since they showed a fringe shift corresponding to a 
speed of 8 km/sec.” 

Comments in the light of new data. 

 The  author  does  not  quote  the  modern  Michelson-Morley  type  experiments, 
the  sensitivity  of  which  has  been  considerably  increased.  In  fact,  the 
experiments  performed  in  vacuum  do  not  detect  the  aether  drift.  Vacuum 
interferometer  experiments  have  always  given  almost  null  effects.  This  was 
the  case  for  Joos  (1930),  and  for  Jaseja  et  al.  (1964),  who  used  masers 

48 

mounted at right angles. Brillet and Hall in 1979 performed an experiment of 
very high sensitivity (about 30 × 10-5) which showed a two-way transit time of 
light almost identical in two perpendicular directions. Confirmation has been 
given recently by Müller et al, Shiller et al, Herrmann et al, among others. 
 An  attempt  to  reinterpret  the  results  obtained  by  Miller  has  recently  been 
made  by  Cahill  and  Kitto  (see  ref  27).  Contrary  to  Brillet  and  Hall’s 
experiment  which  was  performed  in  vacuum,  Miller’s  experiments  were 
operated  in  gas  mode.  In  their  article,  Cahill  and  Kitto  assert  that,  after 
correcting for the refractive index effect of the air, Miller’s experiments reveal 
an absolute speed of the Earth frame of v= 335 ± 57 Km/sec. If confirmed, this 
result  is  in  agreement  with  the  speed  of  v=365 ± 18  km/sec  determined  from 
the  dipole  fit,  in  1991,  to  the  NASA  COBE  satellite  Cosmic  Background 
Radiation (CBR) observations.

According  to  Hayden  it  is  “by  far  the  best  Michelson-Morley  experiment 
performed to date. It has been designed to be clear in its interpretation and free 
of spurious effects”. 
The  authors  have  handled  their  data  in  such  a  manner  that  effects  that  may 
arise from the Earth’s rotation are ignored. 
The experiment performed in vacuum could not detect the aether drift. 
More  recently  the  results  obtained  by  Brillet  and  Hall  have  been  confirmed 
and  improved.  See  for  example  H.  Müller  et  al,  arXiv:  physics/0305117,

The  first  of  these  papers  attempts  a  review  of  the  relativistic  world  aether 
theories  and  seeks  to  identify  the  links  between  them.  The  aether  concepts 
developed by Clube, Cavalleri, Borneas, Wheeler, Nesteruk, Prokhovnik, Ives, 
and Einstein, among others are analyzed. 
The  author  concludes  that  a  promising  role  for  the  aether  within  general 
relativity and cosmology has been convincingly demonstrated in recent years. 
The second paper points out the role of the aether in the formulation of a grand 
comprehensive theory unifying relativity and quantum mechanics. References

concept,  Physical  Interpretations  of  Relativity  Theory  (P.I.R.T.)  9-12 
September 1994 p 206. 
The author gives a thorough analysis of the evolution of Einstein’s ideas about 
the aether. 
“Until  the  end  of  his  life  Einstein  denied  the  existence  of  an  ether  as  it  was 
conceived in 19th century physics, in particular Lorentz’s ether which was in 
the first place a privileged reference frame … because it violated his principle 
of relativity. Nevertheless, in 1916, Einstein proposed a new conception of the 
ether … which does not violate the principle of relativity because the space-
time  is  conceived  in  it  as  a  material  medium  sui-generis  that  can  in  no  way 
constitute a frame of reference”. 
The author points out that in 1918 Lorentz also presented a model of ether at 
rest with respect to every reference frame, not only with respect to a preferred 
frame. 
As  we  have  seen,  the  model  of  ether  we  have  presented  in  the  previous 
chapters lends support to a privileged ether frame.

(Annales scientifiques de l’Ecole Normale Supérieure) 2° serie, t I, p 157 -214, 
and p 364-420. 
The author gives a detailed account of the results of a number of experiments 
designed  to  verify  the  influence  of  the  Earth’s  motion  on  optical  phenomena 
(experiments of Arago, Fresnel, Fizeau, measurement of the rotating power of 
quartz, double refraction, etc.) 
The author concludes that the translation of the Earth has no influence on these 
optical phenomena. As a result, they do not detect the absolute motion of the 
Earth. Only relative motions can be observed. 
The  experiments  performed  by  Mascart  have  cleared  the  way  for  Potier  and 
Veltmann. (See reference to these authors.) However, the conclusions reached 
by Mascart cannot be extended to all types of experiments, 
(for  example,  anisotropy  of  the  CBR,  muon  flux  anisotropy,  Michelson 
experiment in gas mode, Marinov’s experiments.)

The author points out that Potier’s principle denies the theoretical possibility 
of simple optical test of the existence of an aether wind (to first order). 
Nevertheless  the  principle  does  not  apply  to  all  types  of  experiments,  as 
demonstrated in section II.3 (see also ref [1])

A  non  null  fringe  shift  is  observed  when  light  is  sent  in  opposite  directions 
around  a  rotating  table.  The  experiment  lends  support  to  the  hypothesis  of  a 
non entrained aether.

These lessons explain in an elementary but critical way the special theory of 
Relativity and the conceptual foundations of the general theory, giving ample 
place  to  the  most  important  ideas  and  to  their  philosophical  implications.  In 
addition  to  the  orthodox  theory,  the  author  presents  the  most  important 

51 

investigations  made  during  the  last  ten  years.  According  to  him,  there  is  an 
infinite  number  of  theories  equivalent  to  “special  relativity”  all  based  on  the 
existence  of  a  privileged  reference  frame.  He  asserts  that  certain  phenomena 
break 
the  equivalence,  and  are  better  explained  using  absolute 
synchronization. A return to Lorentz aether is finaly possible.  
Although our approaches are quite different, the ideas developed in this book 
show  several  points  of  convergence  with  our  views.  Nevertheless  as  we 
demonstrated  in  this  text  and  in  ref  [1],  if  we  assume  the  existence  of  a 
privileged  reference  frame  and  of  an  aether  drift,  there  is  no  equivalence 
between special relativity and aether theories.

Using Fermat’s principle the authors claim that it is impossible by means of an 
optical  experiment  to  observe  a  first  order  aether  wind  in  v/C.  However,  it 
should  be  borne  in  mind  that  the  idea  is  not  applicable  to  the  experiments 
described in section II.3.

relativity theory  (P.I.R.T), 15-18 September 2000, p 238. 

         Einstein  relativity  leaves  us  today  with  a  number  of  paradoxes.  The  paper 
develops  the  view  that  physical  reality  is  one  thing  while  our  conceptual 
model for it is quite another. When the two do not match, we will make strong 
inferences  from  data  which  can  be  inconsistent  and  lead  to  apparent 
paradoxes. The possibility that a wrong physical model may be embedded in 
Einstein’s relativity theory is traced to the sequence of historical development: 
in the early days of his work, Einstein worked with Maxwell’s electromagnetic 
theory but not modern quantum mechanics. 

         The  proposed  model  includes  facts  that  have  appeared  since  the  advent  of 
quantum  mechanics.  The  author  asserts  that  it  predicts  the  main  features  of 
special relativity without paradoxes as well as the main predictions of general 
relativity.

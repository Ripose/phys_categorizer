Abstract 

technical  realisation  of 

The chopping line is a critical part of the ESS linac in 
the  choppers  and 
term  of 
preservation  of  the  beam  qualities.  A  new  optimised 
design  of  the  ESS  RFQs  and  chopping  lines  is  reported. 
The  beam  dynamics  has  been  optimised  with  H-  beam 
currents up to 100-mA to have safety margin with respect 
to  the  ESS  goals.  The  first  RFQ  transmits  almost  99.7% 
of  the  beam  up  to  2 MeV.  The  line  with  two  choppers 
allows a perfect chopping between 2 bunches. The second 
RFQ  accelerates  the  particles  up  to  5 MeV  with  a 
transmission close to 100%.

INTRODUCTION 

The  European  Spallation  Source  (ESS)  reference 
design is described in ref. [1]. The accelerator is designed 
to  provide  a  proton beam power of 5 MW at a repetition 
rate of 50 Hz. It comprises a 1.334 GeV H- linac (~ 10% 
duty cycle) and two accumulator rings. The proposed lay-
out  of  the linac has two front ends, each one made up of 
an  70 mA  peak  H-  ion  source,  a  low  energy  beam 
transport, a first RFQ, a Medium Energy Beam Transport 
(MEBT) with the choppers and a second RFQ. The bunch 
funnelling  is  done  at  5 MeV  and  a  350 MHz  Drift  Tube 
Linac  (DTL)  accelerates  the  beam  up  to  70 MeV.  In  this 
reference  design  a  700 MHz  normal  conducting  Coupled 
Cavity Linac (CCL) further accelerates the H- beam to the 
final energy. 

2  DESCRIPTION 

In  high  power  proton  accelerators  for  projects  such  as 
ESS  or  the  multi-user facility (CONCERT project [2]), a 
chopped  beam  is  needed  to  reduce  particle  losses  at 
injection  in  the  accumulator  rings.  The  chopping  system 
must be also used to create gaps between the batches sent 
to  the  different  users  by  fast  switching  magnets.  The 
choice  of  2 MeV  as  chopping  energy  results  of  a 
compromise  between  space-charge  induced  debunching 
and  emittance  growth  at  low  energy,  chopper  feasibility 
problems  increasing  with  the  energy  and  the  necessity  to 
stay  below  the  first  radio-activation  threshold  of  copper 
(2.16 MeV). 

The H- source is pulsed with a rise/falling time of about 
10 µs  [3].  The  beam  is  then  pre-chopped  in  the  LEBT 
with  a  rising/falling  time  close  to  1 µs.  The  optimisation 
has  been  done  with  the  beam  injected  at  95 keV  in  the 
first  RFQ.  Experiences  gained  on  high  power  linac  [4,5] 
show that safety margins on both beam current and beam 

emittance  has  to  be  taken  to  obtain  a  robust  design  with 
nominal  parameters.  For  that  purpose,  100 mA  H-  beam 
with 0.25 p
.mm.mrad transverse rms norm emittances was 
the reference for the study presented here. The goal was to 
preserve  the  beam  quality  while  the  chopping  occurs 
between  2  rf  bunches  in  about  2 ns.  Multiparticle  codes 
have  been  used  to  optimise  the  whole  line  (RFQ1  – 
MEBT  –  RFQ2)  to  ensure  realistic  calculations  of  both 
transmission and emittance growth. 

2.1  RFQ1 

The first RFQ is designed to accelerate the beam from 
95 keV to 2 MeV. The beam dynamics is computed using 
both  PARMTEQM  (z-code)  and  TOUTATIS,  a  more 
sophisticated t-code [6]. The optimisation procedure is to 
design an initial RFQ for the full energy range (95 keV up 
to  5 MeV)  and  then  to  cut it in two parts. The maximum 
electric field is maintained below 1.7 Kp (31.3 MV/m) in 
order  to  avoid  sparks  in  the  cavity.  The  main  RFQ1 
parameters are specified in Table 1.

the 

included  between 

last 
accelerating cell and the fringe field [7] and the length of 
this fringe field is adjusted to simplify the MEBT design. 
The  length  of  the  RFQ1  cavity  is  mainly  imposed  by the 
slow  adiabatic  bunching  process  needed  to  reach  a  high 
capture  efficiency  as  in  the  IPHI  project  [4].  The  RF 
segmented  RFQ  concept  is  kept  from  previous  project 
[4,5] for the construction of the ESS RFQ cavities. 

2.2  MEBT 

The aim of the Medium Energy Beam Transport line is 
to  match  the  beam  into  the  second  RFQ  minimising 
emittance growth and halo formation. Less than 0.01% of 
the  chopped  beam  must  enter  the  second  RFQ,  and  the 

transmission  of  the  non-chopped  beam  must  be  higher 
than  95 %.  The  line  is  made  up  of  10  quadrupoles,  3 
bunchers  and  2  choppers.  The total length (2.1m) is kept 
as short as possible to minimise the emittance growth. The 
2 choppers are installed inside the quadrupoles.

The 2 diaphragms are shown in red. 

 

The first diaphragm prevents damages on the choppers. 
The second one collects the chopped beam and cleans the 
non-chopped beam before RFQ2 (about 7 kW of stopped 
particles  is  expected  from  the  chopped  beam).  They  are 
sectored diaphragm to help in the tuning process.

Technologic  choices  -  A  micro-strip  line  meander 
structure  (Figure  3),  like  the  one  chosen  for  the  SNS 
design  [8]  [9],  seems  to  suit  this  type  of  fast  beam 
chopping. The total strip length has to be limited to avoid 
pulse distortion. The choice of a notched line allows large 
strips  width  on 
laminate  keeping  a  50 ohms 
characteristic  impedance  [10].  The  rise  and  fall  time 
requirement in the ns range implies a quasi TEM mode for 
the signal wave propagation.

Due  to  the  non-linearity  of  the  buncher  fields  and  the 
space-charge 
coupling, 
emittance growth are minimum when the bunch transverse 
and longitudinal sizes in the bunchers are small. The line 
has  been  optimised  to  avoid  these  effects  leading  to  the

is 
empirically calculated from previous slit studies in micro-
strip  lines  [12].  The  chamfered  extremities  can  be 
predetermined  from  charts  [13].  The  characteristic 
impedance of the line and the signal phase velocity can be 
deducted from these calculations. 

Figure  4  shows  a  coloured  contour  density  of  the 
electrical  field and equipotential lines. The field ripple is 
less  than  5%  near  the  beam  axe.  Beam  dynamics 
calculations  done  using  multiparticle  codes  do  not  show 
evident effects resulting from this ripple. 

MAFIA  code  [14]  allows  full  3D  simulations  in  the 
temporal  domain.  It  confirms  the  previous  calculations 
within  a  5%  error  margin.  New  calculations  with  mesh 
refinement will be performed soon.

The second RFQ brings the bunched beam from 2 MeV 
to 5 MeV. An inverse transition cell is added between the 
short  matching  section  and 
the 
modulated  vanes 
the  beam 
emittances.  The  5 MeV  final  output  energy  allows  the 
construction of the first drift tubes of the DTL using EM 
quadrupoles  as  demonstrated  by 
IPHI  R&D 
programme.  Again,  100 000  particles  have  been 
transported  from  RFQ1  to  RFQ2  through  the  MEBT  to 
ensure  realistic  simulations.  The  main  RFQ2  parameters 
are shown in Table 1.

Moreover  Pspice  electrical  simulations  [15]  dealing 
with “lossy” line fitted with appropriate coefficients let us 
assert  that  we  can  reach  the  desired  rise  and  fall  times 
with  a  single  50 cm  long  chopper.  Nevertheless,  two 
24 cm long choppers were used for the simulations. Table 
5  summarises  the  geometrical  and  electrical  values  to 
reach the chopping requirements. 

3  CONCLUSION 

The present design of the two 352 MHz RFQs and the 
chopping  line  allows  a  perfect  chopping  between  two 
bunches  without  beam  characteristics  degradations.  A 
prototype  is  in  construction  and  will  be  tested  soon  to 
confirm the calculated performance of the chopper.

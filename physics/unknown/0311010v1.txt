Abstract

The reversible phase transition induced by femtosecond laser excitation of Gallium has

been studied by measuring the dielectric function at 775 nm with ~ 200 fs temporal resolution.

The real and imaginary parts of the transient dielectric function were calculated from absolute

reflectivity  of  Gallium  layer  measured  at  two  different  angles  of  incidence,  using  Fresnel

formulas.    The  time-dependent  electron-phonon  effective  collision  frequency,  the  heat

conduction coefficient and the volume fraction of a new phase were restored directly from the

experimental  data,  and  the  time  and  space  dependent  electron  and  lattice  temperatures  in  the

layer undergoing phase transition were reconstructed without ad hoc assumptions.  We converted

the temporal dependence of the electron-phonon collision rate into the temperature dependence,

and  demonstrated,  for  the  first  time,  that  the  electron-phonon  collision  rate  has  a  non-linear

character.  This temperature dependence converges into the known equilibrium function during

the  cooling  stage.    The  maximum  fraction  of  a  new  phase  in  the  laser-excited  Gallium  layer

reached only 60% even when the deposited energy was two times the equilibrium enthalpy of

melting.    We  have  also  demonstrated  that  the  phase  transition  pace  and  a  fraction  of  the

transformed  material  depended  strongly  on  the  thickness  of  the  laser-excited  Gallium  layer,

which  was  of  the  order  of  several  tens  of  nanometers  for  the  whole  range  of  the  pump  laser

fluencies up to the damage threshold.  The kinetics of the phase transformation after the laser

excitation can be understood on the basis of the classical theory of the first-order phase transition

while the duration of non-thermal stage appears to be comparable to the sub-picosecond pulse

length.

I.  INTRODUCTION

2

Phase transformations induced by femtosecond laser pulses in metals and semiconductors

have attracted significant attention for two main reasons: the quest for improved understanding of
the microscopic nature of phase transitions1-5 on femtosecond time scale and nanometer space

scale;  and  the  development  of  applications  such  as,  for  example,  an  all-optical  switch  in
photonics.6-9

The  pump-probe  technique  with  subpicosecond  laser  pulses  was  broadly  used  for

studying  these  transformations  during  the  last  twenty  years.    The  transient  reflectivity  of  the

laser-excited sample was measured with a single optical probe technique with time resolution up

to 100 fs while the use of two optical probes allowed one to recover the real and imaginary parts
of  the  full  transient  dielectric  function  of  a  material  undergoing  phase  transition.10,11  The

reflectivities  measured  by  the  optical  probes  directly  follow  the  changes  in  the  electronic

properties of the laser-excited matter.  In order to observe the structural changes in a lattice on a
picosecond  time  scale  the  non-linear  probe12  and  ultra-short  x-ray  probes1,13  were  explored

together with the optical probe.  Several new phenomena were uncovered in these studies.  The

electron  temperature  in  a  solid  rises  swiftly  under  the  femtosecond  laser  excitation  while  the

lattice  remains  cold.    The  electrons  transfer  the  absorbed  laser  energy  to  the  lattice  via  the

electron-phonon collisions and heat conduction.  The structural changes that occur during the

period  shorter  than  the  electron-to-lattice  energy  transfer  time  are  referred  to  as  non-thermal
phase transition (or, coherent displacement of atoms1).  The phase transformation that develops

after the electron-to-lattice temperature equilibration is referred to as ultra-fast thermal transition.

The natural question arises: What is the phase state of a solid excited by ultra-short pulse

action?    The  numerous  reflectivity  measurements  with  a  single  probe  suggest  that  several

picoseconds  after  the  excitation,  a  solid  is  melted  because  the  maximum  reflectivity  value

corresponds to that of the melted stage.  We demonstrate in this paper that the phase transition is

not completed in as long as 20 ps after the pulse termination even in the case when the deposited

energy density exceeds twofold the equilibrium enthalpy of melting.  Moreover, there is no direct

experimental  evidence  if  the  transient  phase-state  is  a  crystal-melt  mix  or  a  mixture  of  two

different crystalline phases, possibly unknown ones.

We have recently demonstrated with a single probe technique that the reflectivity of a

Gallium  film  excited  by  femtosecond  laser  pulses  increases  from  ~55%  to  ~80%  before
recovering  to  its  initial  value  after  ~  0.1-1  µs.7    This  evolution  was  attributed  to  a  reversible

3

phase  transition  from  the  crystalline  α-Gallium  to  the  liquid  state  because  the  reflectivity

maximum corresponds to that of liquid Gallium.  To ensure the process was reversible, the total

laser fluence was kept well below the ablation threshold (Fpump << Fabl) and the average pulse
intensity was below the threshold for plasma formation (Ilaser ∼ 1010 W/cm2).  We have shown in

measurements using a single probe beam that the magnitude and rate of the reflectivity changes

as  well  as  the  time  of  recovery  to  the  initial  state  depend  on  the  excitation  conditions  and
background  temperature  of  the  Ga  film.7    However,  the  transient  reflectivity  obtained  with  a

single probe beam did not allow us an unambiguous evaluation of the material parameters during

the phase transition.

In this paper, we used one pump beam and two identical simultaneous 150-femtosecond

probe beams (at 775nm wavelength) set at two different angles of incidence: 12° and 32°.  The

simultaneous determination of the transient reflectivity for the two probes allowed us to recover

the time-resolved real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function ε(ω,t) of the Gallium film

during the phase transition.  One can also work out the volume fraction of liquid phase from the

measured  dielectric  function  assuming  that  the  transient  state  consists  from  the  mixture  of

crystalline and liquid Gallium.  It was remarkable to find that the transformation into another

phase never reached 100% during the observation time.  We have shown that the main reason for

incomplete phase transformation is a small depth of laser-excited Gallium layer comprising 10 to

20 atomic distances.  Subsequently, the transient dielectric function allowed us to recover the

time dependent electron-phonon effective collision frequency (sometimes referred to as optical or

transport frequency) and plasma frequency during the phase transition.  The transient values of

these  parameters  for  the  intermediate  state  created  by  the  laser  were  found  to  be  drastically

different from those in the equilibrium for the crystalline and liquid phase.

The space and time dependent electron and lattice temperatures in the laser-excited skin

layer were reconstructed from the experimental reflectivity data without any ad hoc assumptions.

Then, the phase transformation history in space and in time was reconstructed on the basis of the

heating and cooling processes of the skin layer.

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.    The  experimental  set-up,  the  target  structure  and

diagnostics  are  described  in  Section  II.    The  experimentally  determined  transient  reflectivity,

dielectric function ε(t), electron-phonon collision rate, plasma frequency, and volume fraction of

a new phase are presented in Section III.  The heating due to the laser absorption, the electron-

phonon energy exchange, and the cooling due to electron heat conduction, all are restored using

the  experimental  data  only.    The  threshold  energy  density  for  the  phase  transition  and  the

4

temperature dependence of the electron-phonon coupling rate are calculated in Section IV.  The

non-equilibrium and thermal stages of phase transformation are considered in a restricted space

of the skin layer and discussed in Section V, and the conclusions are presented in Section VI.

II.  EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

The scheme of the experimental set-up is shown in Fig.1.  A femtosecond Ti:sapphire

laser (Clark-MXR CPA 2001, λ = 775 nm , pulse duration tp = 150 fs, pulse energy Ep ≅ 1 mJ,

repetition rate 1 kHz) provided the s-polarized pump pulse and the two p-polarized probes.  The

target consisted of a 1–2 µm thick Ga-film deposited on a 1 mm thick SiO2 substrate.  The pump

was normally incident onto the target from the silica side, as were the probes, that were set at
angles of incidence of 12° and 32° respectively.  The probe beams were tightly focused using f =

100 mm lenses so that the region probed corresponded to the most uniform central 5% of the

pump spot.  The pump and probe beam dimensions, and the beam overlap were monitored using

a CCD camera and microscope imaging system.  The pump and probe beam areas were Spump ≈
6.1×10-4 cm2  and  S (φ1)  ≈  S(φ2)  ≈ 2.6×10-5 cm2.    Small  probe  beams  were  used  to  minimize

degradation of the temporal resolution caused by the different angles with which the three beams

irradiated the target surface.  The two probe beams had transverse dimensions of ∆x(φ1) = 32 µm,

∆x(φ2)  =  34  µm, and this limited the temporal resolution to ∼23 fs for probe 1 and ∼70 fs for

probe 2.

Delay lines placed in the pump and probe optical paths were adjusted to obtain temporal

overlap (t0 = 0) between the three beams.  This was determined by detecting the onset of the

pump induced reflectivity change using the probe beams individually whilst varying the pump-

probe delay time.  The resolution of the motion controller used to scan the delay of the pump

beam relative to the probes was ∆xmin = 2 µm which corresponds to ∆t = 13 fs, well below the

resolution due to the incident angles of the probes.  Using 150-fsec laser pulses the real temporal

resolution  was  therefore  limited  to  about  200  fs  in  these  experiments.    The  pump  and  probe

beams were cross-polarized (s-polarization for the pump and p-polarization for the probes) to

minimize the influence of coherent artifacts when the pump and probes overlapped in time, i.e.

for time delays within a few hundred fs of t0 = 0.

The pump fluence was varied from 0.1 mJ/cm2 to 6 mJ/cm2 using neutral density filters.

The probe beam intensities were adjusted to a level at which they induced no detectable changes

in the reflectivity.  It was also verified that the two probes had no influence on one other.  The

reflected signals Rp(ϕ1 = 12°)  and  Rp(ϕ2 = 32°) from the Ga-silica interface were collected by

5

lenses and detected by photodiodes.  Iris diaphragms were positioned in the focal planes of the

lenses  to  filter  the  specular  reflection  from  any  scattering  coming  from  the  target.    The

reflectivity  of  Ga  was  measured  as  the  ratio  of  the  reflected  beam  intensity  relative  to  the

incoming beams and corrected for the reflection losses from the uncoated silica substrate.  The

signals from the photodiodes were collected by computer providing the evolution of Rp(ϕ1) and

Rp(ϕ2) as a function of the delay between the pump and the two synchronized probe pulses.  Each

transmitted value was averaged on a sufficient number of pulses (typically 32 laser pulses per

delay point) to minimize the influence of pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the laser.  The resulting

accuracy of the reflectivity was ±0.5% at each point.  Numerical analysis of the isoreflectance

curves for p-polarised  beams  at  12°  and  32°  angles  of  incidence  plotted  in  the  {Re(ε),Im(ε)}

plane for both crystalline and liquid Gallium suggested that the resulting accuracy to which the

real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the  dielectric  functions  could  be  determined  was  ±2%,  and    ±1%
repectively.14

substrates.

The  Ga-films  were  deposited  using  pulsed  laser  deposition  from  6N-purity  Ga  targets
onto  Silica  substrates  at  –100°C  in  a  chamber  pumped  to  ∼  2×10-6  Torr  using  a  Q-switched
mode-locked  Nd:YAG  laser  (λ  =  1.064  µm,  tFWHM  =  60  ps,  intensity  on  the  target  I0 ∼  1011
W/cm2) and described in detail elsewhere.6,7  The crystalline structure of the deposited Ga-film

consisted of the α-phase of Gallium that is an elemental metallic molecular crystal containing

6

Ga2 dimers.15-20  It has been determined that the covalent bonded Ga2 dimers are oriented almost
perpendicular to the film surface.21,22  The Ga mirrors were mounted on a Peltier cooler to allow

the sample temperature to be varied.  The temperature at the rear surface of Gallium film was

maintained at 16°C during all the experiments, well below the Ga melting point (29.8°C).  The

target was translated between each run (at varying pump fluence) to provide a fresh Ga-film zone

to  minimize  any  effects  of  cumulative  damage,  therefore  ensuring  similar  initial  operating

conditions for all the experiments.  Auxiliary experiments were performed to check that the fused

silica  substrate  was  insensitive  to  the  level  of  the  pump  irradiation  (i.e.  without  the  Ga-film

deposited).  No non-reversible changes of the optical properties of the Ga-silica interface were
detected for pump fluences up to Fpump ~ 4 mJ/cm2 and for 106 laser pulses per spot.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A.  Transient reflectivity

The  reflectivity  of  the  Ga-film,  measured  at  12°  and  32°  during  the  first  25  ps  after

excitation is plotted in Fig. 2 for three pump fluences.  It is clear that the reflectivity grows in

two-stages: a rapid rise during the first ~ 2-4 ps was followed by a slower increase over a much

longer  period.    The  reflectivity  reached  its  maximum  (not  shown  on  Fig.  2)  a  few  hundred
picoseconds after the laser excitation.7  This maximum exceeded the reflectivity data at t = 25 ps

presented in Fig. 2 by a few percent.

1.4 mJ/cm2; 2.2 mJ/cm2; and 3.85 mJ/cm2.  A two-stage reflectivity rise is clearly seen at

all laser fluences.

7

The maximum reflectivity change at t = 25 ps for a pump fluence Fpump ~ 3.85 mJ/cm2 was in

excess  of  ~50  %  for  both  probes:  R p(ϕ1,t  =  +25  ps)/Rp(ϕ1,t  =  0  ps)  ≈   0.51  and  Rp(ϕ2,t  =

+25ps)/Rp(ϕ2,t = 0ps) ≈ 0.61.  These values are consistent with the reflectivity changes Rp(ϕ1)

35°C/Rp(ϕ1)16°C ≈ 0.52 and Rp(ϕ2)35°C/Rp(ϕ2)16°C ≈ 0.57 measured when the film was heated above

its  melting  point  using  the  Peltier  element.    The  reflectivity  changes  in  such  equilibrium

conditions represent the transition of Gallium from the α-crystalline phase to a metal-like liquid

state.    The  relative  reflectivity  change  at  a  fixed  delay  of  25  ps  as  a  function  of  pump  laser

fluence is shown in Fig. 3.  The threshold fluence leading to an observable change in reflection
was Fthrd ~ 0.5-0.7 mJcm-2, which is in accordance with our previous single-probe experiments.7

fluence.  Straight lines are linear fits to the data, showing threshold fluence of 0.5 – 0.7
mJ/cm2.

For Fpump > 4 mJ/cm2, the sample was clearly damaged by a few minutes of exposure to
the pump pulses (~105 laser shots).  This damage threshold was significantly lower than the value
of ~40–50 mJ/cm2 obtained using a 30 Hz Ti:sapphire laser.7  This difference  is probably caused

by the much higher repetition rate laser used in the present experiments and the use of the low

thermal conductivity fused silica substrate that limits the cooling of the Gallium layer between

successive laser pulses.

We should note here a regularly observed feature for all the reflectivity measurements

with one and with two probes, which is a presence of oscillations with the period of order of

picoseconds,  and  the  amplitude  well  above  the  experimental  error.    Such  oscillations  of

8

reflectivity on the picosecond time scale were observed in a number of experiments.23,24  These

oscillations are related to the generation of (1-0.1) THz optical phonons.  The detailed study of

this phenomenon is out of scope of the present paper.

B.  Transient dielectric function: Mixture of α-Ga and liquid Ga or intermediate transient phase?

Let  us  consider  as  an  example,  the  transient  dielectric  function  determined  from  the
reflectivity  measurements  (Fig.4a)  for  intermediate  fluence,  Fpump  ~2.2  mJ/cm2,  that  is  well

below the damage threshold.

The reflection coefficient is related to the real, ε1 = Re(ε), and imaginary, ε2 = Im(ε), parts
of the dielectric function through the Fresnel formulae for s- and p-polarized light.25  Thus, two

reflectivity values at different angles of incidence form a set of two algebraic equations for two

unknowns, ε1 and ε2.  Numerical solution of these equations as a function of time produces the

total complex transient dielectric function of Gallium during the phase transition (see Fig.4a,b).

For these calculations, we assumed that polarization of probe beams is unchanged by the Ga-

film.    The  a  posteriori calculated reflectivity values using the dielectric function obtained in

accordance  to  the  above  procedure  is  also  shown  in  Figure  4a.    The  solutions  accurately

reproduced the evolution of the reflectivity observed experimentally.  Moreover, good agreement

between the calculated dielectric function and that known from the literature for Ga in the α-

crystalline and liquid states is obtained as shown in Table I.

It  is  clearly  seen  from  Fig.4b  that  both  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the  reflectivity  lie

between the values for crystal and liquid Gallium (see Table I).  Thus, the simplest interpretation

is that the measured dielectric function, ε, corresponds to that of a mixture of the two equilibrium

phases, α-Gallium  with  the  dielectric  function, εa-Ga,  and  the  liquid  phase  with  the  dielectric

function, εliq-Ga.

dielectric functions for different Ga states are consistent with the data in Refs. [26-28]

and provide independent reflectivity data allowing to check the code accuracy.

We  consider  the  transient  state  of  Gallium  as  a  homogeneous  mixture  of  two  phases
ignoring the difference of 0.19 g/cm3 in the material densities of the crystalline and liquid phases.
We calculate the volume fraction of liquid with the use the Maxwell Garnett formula,29 that gives

correct values for limits of both low and high concentrations, and coincides with an exact Landau
formula in the limit of small concentration (up to 40%).25  Thus, the volume fraction of the liquid

phase, C, in a bulk material formed a crystalline α-Gallium determines the dielectric function of
the mixture of phases εtrans as follows:29

The  concentration  of  liquid  Gallium  in  the  transient  phase  can  be  calculated by applying this
2)1/2, (see Fig.5).  It follows from

formula to the modulus of the dielectric function |ε| = (ε1

2+ε2

Fig. 5 that the phase transition into a liquid Gallium is not completed during the first 20 ps for the

whole  range  of  the  pump  fluences  in  these  experiments  below  the  damage  threshold.    At  the

10

maximum laser fluence of 2.85 mJ/cm2 the laser energy density deposited into the skin layer is
almost two times higher than the equilibrium enthalpy of melting of 479.2 J/cm3 (see Section IV-

B below).  We should note, however, that this interpretation of the physical state of the material

as a mixture of the two limiting phases is only one of the possibilities.  We cannot exclude the

possibility  that  the  material  undergoes  progressive  transformation  into  an  intermediate  phase,

which is different from liquid or crystalline Gallium as a result of irradiation.

A close examination of Figure 6 shows that even at the largest deposited energy of 2.85 mJ/cm2

in the graph, being four times larger than the threshold required to observe reflectivity changes,

neither the electron-phonon collision rate nor the plasma frequency reach the values for liquid

Gallium in equilibrium conditions.  The existence of two time stages with different slopes is also

evident in Fig. 6; rapid changes occur during the first 2-4 ps followed by a slower evolution over

The power dependences for the two stages are distinctly different.  The initial fast decrease of the

electron-phonon  collision  rate  depends  strongly  on  the  amount  of  the  energy  deposited.    The

interpolation  shows  that  power  exponent  for  the  time  dependence  of  the  electron-phonon

collision rate changes within the limits: α ~ 0.004–0.124; β ~ 0.03-0.23  for the range of fluences

used in the experiments.

D. Relation between the optical rate and the electron-phonon energy exchange rate

The  electron  and  lattice  temperatures  both  change  in  all  stages  of  the  laser  energy

absorption, the absorbed energy transfer from the electrons to the lattice, and the lattice cooling

by the electron heat conduction.  The transformation into a new phase and reverse transition back

to the crystalline phase is driven by the electron and lattice temperature distribution, both in time

and in space.  The measured transient real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function allow

one to calculate the electron-phonon effective collision rate,νopt, (optical, or transport effective

frequency) and the plasma frequency.

The electron-to-phonon energy exchange rate νen expresses through the experimentally

measured optical rate by the following procedure.  The conductivity of metals is conventionally

calculated  for  the  low  values  of  the  adiabaticity  parameter  hω εD F/
TL,Te<< εF), by the means of the density functional theory;31 here ωD is the Debye frequency.

The  optical  (transport)  relaxation  time  that  defines  the  conductivity  expresses  in  the  theory

through the moments of the electron-phonon spectral function as the following:

here  the  bracketed  frequency  is  the  first  moment  of  the  phonon  frequency  averaged  over  the
electron-phonon spectral function.  The n-th moment of the frequency reads:31,33

The λ-function,  λ(ω,T), relates to the effective (re-normalized) electron mass, m*.  It is expressed

through the zero moment of the spectral function.  The electron-phonon energy exchange rate (or,

the  inverse  electron-phonon  equilibration  time  te-ph)  was  introduced  in  two-temperature
approximation (electrons and phonons are characterized by separate temperatures, Te, TL)32,33 in

The physical meaning of the bracketed frequency is the average frequency and average of the

square  of  phonon  frequency.    One  can  estimate  the  average  phonon  frequency  in  adiabatic
approximation near the Debye temperature T ~ TD as the following:34

Thus, the energy exchange rate links to the optical rate through the fundamental characteristics of
a material as the following:34

We adopt this relation for the future calculations, keeping in mind that the time dependence (and

therefore, the temperature dependence, as we show below) of the optical rate is obtained from the

experiments.    The energy exchange rate can be recovered directly from the experimental data.
We  present  the  optical  data  for  three  different  metals:  Aluminium,43  Copper,43  and
Gallium,20,26-28 in equilibrium conditions at λ = 775 nm (ω = 2.43×1015 s-1), as examples of these

relaxation times in Table 3 below.

It  can  be  seen  from  Table  3  that  the  energy  relaxation  time  depends  strongly  on  the

absorption properties of the material.  In highly reflective metals like Copper this relaxation time

compares  to  a  few  picoseconds,  while  in  Gallium  it  is  100  fs.    Note that the electron-phonon

energy exchange time in Ga is shorter than the 150 fs laser pulse duration.

Taking the known relaxation rates, νopt and νen, the time history of the electron and lattice

temperatures in a solid affected by the short laser pulse can be restored, and then the dependence

of the effective electron-phonon collision frequency on temperature can be derived.  We follow

this procedure below.

Another  important  parameter,  the  coefficient  of  electron  heat  conduction, κe,  is  also

directly related to the measured electron-phonon collision rate:

here Ce(Te) is the specific heat for the degenerated electrons, le is the electron mean free path, ve
is the electron speed, and vF is the Fermi velocity (vF = 1.92×106 m/s for Ga).  Therefore, the

transient electron and lattice temperatures in the Gallium layer during the laser-target interaction

and after the pulse termination can be calculated without any ad hoc assumption and only on the

basis of the measured reflectivity data.

IV. HEATING AND COOLING PROCESSES

A.  Energy absorption and transient temperature in Gallium layer

The laser fluence in all experiments was well below the ablation threshold.  Therefore, the

density  of  the  target  remains  essentially  unchanged,  and  the  laser-matter  interaction  occurs

through the normal skin effect regime.  Since there is no mass or momentum loss, the energy

conservation law can be expressed in a two temperature approximation (Te, for electrons, TL, for
lattice) by the following set of coupled equations:32,33

Here Ce, CL, ne, na, respectively, are the electron and lattice specific heat and the density of free

time and per unit volume; νen is the electron-phonon energy exchange rate from Eq.(9), and ke is

heat conduction coefficient from Eq. (10).  The electron heat conduction dominates in the cooling

process, and the phonon heat conduction is neglected.  The specific heat of the lattice obeys the

conventional Dulong-Petit law CL = 3kB.  The specific heat of the degenerated Fermi electron gas
(Te << εF) has a conventional form:35

where m*, εF respectively are the electron effective mass and the Fermi energy (εF = 10.4 eV).35
Qe can be calculated for the normal skin effect interaction mode as:36

In case of α-Gallium, taking k = 3.64 for λ = 775 nm,20 this time theat = 3.75×10-12 s, which is

longer than the pulse duration and the electron-to-lattice energy transfer time estimated above.

Therefore, the heating and cooling processes are well separated in time in the experiments.

(13)

16

B.  Electron and lattice temperature during the laser pulse

The transient electron and lattice temperature during the pulse can be calculated in two-

temperature  approximation  (Eq.(11))  using  the  material  parameters  recovered  from  the

experiments.  The results of the numerical integration of the set of Eq.(11) for a laser pulse with a

Gaussian  shape  in  time  are  presented  in  Fig.  7  for  various  laser  intensities.    The  electron

temperature rises in the middle of the pulse up to 1000 K (Te << εF) for the highest intensity.  The

energy transfer from the electrons to the lattice is completed to the end of the laser pulse, Te = TL

= T at t = te-ph ≅ tp.  As the heating and cooling processes are well separated in time, any cooling

processes during the laser pulse can be neglected.  So, the total energy deposited in the Gallium

skin layer just after the end of the pulse (t = tp) Etot can be estimated as the sum of the absorbed

laser energy Qabs and the internal energy corresponding to the initial constant temperature of the

target Qint (T0 = 16°C or 289 K):

The  skin  depth  in  Ga  for  775  nm  comprises  ls =  34  nm.    Taking  the  measured  absorption

coefficient A ≈0.5, the absorbed energy in the skin layer as a function of the laser fluence can be
expressed in the form E [J/cm3] = 3×105F [J/cm2].  Therefore, the observed threshold fluence for
the reflectivity change of 0.7 mJ/cm2 corresponds to a deposited energy of 210 J/cm3, which is

almost 2.5 times lower than the enthalpy of melting of Gallium in equilibrium conditions, 479.2
J/cm3.29  The highest fluence in our experiments, 2.85 mJ/cm2, corresponds to an energy density
of 855 J/cm3.

From this we deduce that the reflectivity starts to change (Fthr ≅ 0.7 mJ/cm2) when the maximum

lattice temperature reaches 390 K, well above the melting temperature in equilibrium of 303 K

(29.8°C).  When the deposited energy density in the Gallium skin layer exceeds the equilibrium
enthalpy of melting, which occurs for fluences above 1.65 J/cm2, the lattice temperature rises
strongly  becoming  605  K  at  2.2  J/cm2;  698  K  at  2.85  J/cm2;  and  840  K  at  3.85  mJ/cm2.

However,  the  measured  reflectivity  values  in  the  experiments  (for  t<20ps)  always  remained

slightly lower than those observed for liquid Gallium and obtained by heating the film up to ∼

309  K  (35°C),  i.e.  above  the  melting  temperature  in  the  equilibrium  conditions.    As  deduced

earlier, in the experiments (Figs. 3-6) the phase transition to the liquid state is not complete for at

least several tens of picoseconds after the laser pulse in spite of the fact that the electron and

lattice temperatures have equilibrated at values far exceeding the melting temperature.

Next  consider  temperature  distribution  in  the  film.    In  accordance  with  Eq.(13),  the

temperature decreases exponentially with the distance from the surface:

Thus,  the  thickness  of  the  layer,  where  the  phase  transition  would  be  expected  to  occur,  is
comparable to the skin depth over the whole range of fluences studied (from 0.7 mJ/cm2 to 3.85
mJ/cm2).  It comprises ls < xmelt < 1.8 ls (34 nm < xmelt < 59 nm) and corresponds to a few tens of

atomic layers (see Fig.8).

C.  Cooling by the electron heat conduction after temperature equilibration

At t > te-ph, the energy deposited in the skin-layer is transported away from the layer by

means of electron heat conduction in equilibrium conditions, Te = TL.  The lattice specific heat

dominates (CL >> Ce), while the electrons are responsible for the heat transfer.  The set of Eq.(11)

plasma frequency (ω2

Thus, a non-linear heat wave with a step-like temperature front propagates inside the bulk of the

cold Gallium.  The time dependence of the temperature allows us to recover the time dependence

Now,  we  can  relate  the  experimentally  observed  time  dependence  of  the  electron-phonon

collision rate, νopt  ~ t-β, to the above formula, to obtain that  n=

+(
1β
3

)
β .  The reflectivity, as

well as the optical parameters deduced from the reflectivity measurements, changes significantly

in  the  first  2-4  ps  after  the  pulse  termination,  and  is  almost  constant  in  next  20  picoseconds.
Thus, β changes in the range from 0.03 to 0.23 (F = 0.7-2.85 mJ/cm2) during the first 2-4 ps, and

is almost constant in the remaining part of the observation time 4-20 ps.  That corresponds to

changes in n = 0.087-0.56 in the first 2-4 ps, and n ≈ 0 after that in the temperature dependence

law.    Therefore,  the  heat  conduction  law  depends  on  the  magnitude  of  the  laser  fluence  and

changes with time during the cooling process in the following way: at n ≈ 0 it is a non-linear heat
conduction with T~t-1/3, while at n -> 1 it tends to the conventional linear process, T~t-1/2.

The  electron-phonon  effective  collision  rate  in  liquid  Gallium  under  the  equilibrium

conditions is proportional to temperature, νopt ~ T/TD.    The  experimental  measurements in  the
temperature  range  up  to  860  K  are  in  close  agreement  with  the  linear  law.26,28    Hence,  the

temperature  dependence  of  the  electron-phonon  collision  rate  tends  to  that  for  liquid  Ga  in

equilibrium conditions with the increase of intensity (fluence).  The resulting expression of the

20

(23)

recovered non-linear dependence of the electron-phonon collision rate on temperature, νopt ~ ν0Tn

(n  <  1),  is  another  confirmation  of  the  fact  that  the  crystal-to-liquid  phase  transition  was  not

completed in the whole range of laser intensities studied here.

The characteristic cooling time, t0, (see Eq.(21)) corresponds to the time for the heat wave

to  propagate  over  a  distance  equal  to  ls.    It  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  deposited  energy

density:

here Tmax is given by Eq.(16).  This time is much longer than the electron-phonon equilibration
time, therefore n ~0.  Taking ne = 3na, m* = me, ν0 = 2×1015 s-1 for the mixture of phases, and T0
= 289K, one obtains t0 [s] = 4.6×10-8/Tmax [K].  Thus, the characteristic cooling time ranges from
120 ps (0.7 mJ/cm2) to 55 ps (3.85 mJ/cm2).  One can also obtain the time for the temperature in
Gallium layer to decrease back to the melting point of Tmelt = 303 K: tmelt= t0(Tmax/Tmelt)2, ranging
from 0.23 ns for 0.7 mJ/cm2 to 0.43 ns (3.85 mJ/cm2).  We consider that as the time when the

reverse liquid-to-crystal phase transition takes place.  This time is in a good agreement with our
previous observations with a single probe beam.7

V.  DISCUSSION

The change in the material properties induced by the femtosecond laser pulses occurs in a

different way during two periods.  The first period comprises the time interval shorter than the

electron-to-lattice  energy  transfer  time,  t < te-ph.    The  absorbed  energy  is  deposited  to  the

electrons but the lattice remains cold.  The material transition during this time interval is referred

to as a “non-thermal – non-equilibrium” phase transition.  During the second period, at t > te-ph,

the  transition  proceeds  in  conditions  for  which  the  electron  and  lattice  temperatures  are

equilibrated.  In this case the phase transition is considered as a thermal one.

The material transformation takes place in a thin layer that comprises only several atomic

layers and the thickness of the layer heated above the phase transition temperature varies rapidly

in time.  We consider, therefore, the implications of the space and time constraints on the kinetics

of the phase transformation in such conditions.

A.  The non-equilibrium stage, Te >> TL

During the non-equilibrium stage that lasts ∼ 100 fs the electrons gain an average energy

in excess of the melting temperature.  Any excited electron produces a change in the inter-atomic

equilibrium position (i.e. the generation of optical phonons):

Here d and Ji are the inter-atomic distance and the ionisation potential respectively.  The average

According to Ref. [38], the average displacement of an atom for the temperature range of 400-

1000 K, typical for melting of the majority of solids, is 0.2-0.25 of the elementary cell radius.

The atomic displacement following from Eq.(25) is of the order of a few tenths of Angstrom.

The period of these oscillations is of the same order of magnitude as the time necessary to shift

an atom into a position corresponding to a new phase.  It can be estimated in the framework of
the  adiabatic  approximation.34    Momentum  of  an  oscillating  atom  can  be  estimated  from

This  time  for  Gallium  equals  to  approximately  100  femtoseconds  and  agrees  with  similar
calculations for Si and GaAs.4  The process described above can be considered as a “coherent

displacement”  of  lattice  layers  in  the  heated  skin  layer  due  to  electrons  excitation.    In  other

words, this is a fast (on the time scale of the laser pulse) loss of long-range (crystalline) order on

the space scale of the whole laser-excited layer.  There are two other forces that can also lead to a

coherent displacement of the lattice during the time before electron-phonon equilibration: the

gradient of the electronic pressure, and the ponderomotive force of the laser electric field in the

skin layer.  The effect of coherent displacement manifests itself in non-linear phenomena such as
second-harmonic  generation  (involving  loss  of  symmetry),12  or  in  the  change  of  the  x-ray
diffraction intensity.1  In both studies1,12 the electron-phonon energy exchange time of several ps

was significantly longer than the laser pulse duration (~100 fs).  Therefore, the effect of non-

thermal modification was pronounced.

In the experiment described in this paper, the time for loss-of-long-range-order due to a

coherent displacement is comparable to the laser pulse duration and to the electron-to-phonon

energy  exchange  time.    Therefore,  any  non-thermal  phase  transition  could  not  be  observed

22

because of the limited 200 fs resolution in the experiments.  Moreover, any change in specular

reflection  is  a  manifestation  of  loss  of  the  short-range  order  (correlation  between  close

neighbours) and this evolves on the picosecond timescale.

B.  Thermal stage of phase transformation, Te = TLattice

The crystal lattice heated above the phase transition temperature passes into an unstable
state39 with thermal oscillations of an atom at elevated temperature allowing it to be shifted into a

new equilibrium position close to that of a new phase.  The transformation into the new phase is

seeded, therefore, by this unstable state.

There are two possibilities for developing thermal phase transition in the conditions when

the heated skin layer of Gallium is confined between a cold glass substrate and a cold Gallium

film that is kept at a constant temperature below the melting point.  The first possibility relates to

the surface assisted phase transition.  The maximum temperature in the heated layer occurs near

the  Silica-Gallium  interface  and  this  suggests  that  transformation  into  a  new  phase  would  be

energetically favored at this interface provided the surface tension between the liquid Gallium
and  Silica  is  lower  than  that  for  the  crystal-liquid  Gallium  interface.40    However,  the  surface

tension between the liquid Gallium and Silica is unknown to the best of our knowledge.

On the other side, the formation of liquid seeds in the bulk of a crystal heated from inside

while the boundary is kept at the temperature below the melting point is energetically preferred
for the bulk melting39.  Besides, the thickness of the overheated layer increases at high fluences.

Consequently, we consider below the formation of seeds of liquid Ga in the bulk of the heated

Gallium layer.

The  small  seeds  of  the  new  phase  are  created  in  the  overheated  layer  due  to  lattice
fluctuations39.  These  seeds  are,  however,  unstable  structures  because  the  formation  of  an

interface between the two phases requires extra energy to overcome the surface tension at that

interface.  Hence seeds with a size less than a critical value will decay back into the initial phase,

whilst  seeds  with  a  size  exceeding  a  minimum  critical  radius  will  grow  rapidly  driving

transformation of the bulk into the new phase.  The critical radius of a seed can be expressed
through the temperature of the overheated layer, T, as follows:39

Here α is the surface tension between the crystal and liquid Gallium (α = 720 dyne/cm),40 P' is

the  transient  pressure  in  the  skin  layer,  and  P  is  the  pressure  corresponding  to  the  melting

23

(28)

temperature, P= naTmelt.  We neglected a small difference in the densities of liquid and solid Ga
(ρsolid = 5.907 g/cm3; ρliquid = 6.095 g/cm3 near and above the melting point at 29.8°C)41 in the

above  calculations.  The  probability  of  a  seed  formation  is  a  strong  exponential  function  of  a
critical radius39:

w

∝


exp







This  probability  drops  sharply  with  the  increase  of  the  critical  radius,  and  the  phase

transformation process slows down.  The lattice temperature grows up during the short period of

electron-phonon  energy  transfer.    Afterwards,  the  temperature  slowly  decreases  ensuring  the

increase of the critical radius and slowing down the phase transformation process.  This is the

main reason for the incompleteness of the phase transformation during the femtosecond laser

pulse  excitation.    Therefore  the  minimum  critical  radius  of  a  liquid  seed  corresponds  to  the

maximum lattice temperature just after the pulse termination.  The minimum radius decreases
from 23.4 nm to 4.4 nm as the fluence increases from 0.7 mJ/cm2 to 2.85 mJ/cm2 (Fig.9).  It is
clear that the phase transformation at F < 0.5 mJ/cm2 is impossible even if temperature exceeds

that for melting because the radius of a critical seed is comparable to the thickness of the layer

with T > Tmelt.  Similarly, the phase transformation is impossible at the cooling stage when a seed

size is comparable to the thickness of the heated layer.  As it follows from Eq.(27), the critical

radius coincides with the skin depth when the lattice temperature is still 60 K above the melting

Let us now estimate the seed formation time.  We consider the seed formation process as

an isotropic atom-to-atom attachment to a seed nucleus with a characteristic thermal velocity vth =
(2T/M)1/2 ~ 105 cm/s.  Then, the time required for a critical seed to be formed can be estimated as

The time for the formation of a seed with the critical radius of 4 nm ( F = 2.85 mJ/cm2 ) is ~ 4 ps.
The  optical  response  builds  up  at  the  depth  of  c/ωpe  that  comprises  ~  10-6 cm  for  Gallium.

Therefore formation of liquid seeds of several nanometers in size can be qualitatively associated

with  the  abrupt  reflectivity  changes  observed  at  this  fluence  in  the  first  2-4  ps  after  the  laser

from  the  experiments  vs  pump  fluence;  b)  –  time  for  seed  formation  with  the  critical
radius.  Note that the critical radius is larger than the skin layer at F < 0.5 mJ/cm2, so the

phase transition does not occur.

It is also worth noting that during femtosecond excitation of any material, the pressure

inside the skin layer increases along with the temperature.  In the Gallium skin layer, the pressure
varies from 3 to 5 kbar for fluences in the range 0.7 mJ/cm2 < F < 2.85 mJ/cm2.  The melting

temperature  of  Ga(I)  decreases  with  increasing  pressure:  at  1.2  GPa  (12  kbar)  the  melting
temperature  has  dropped  to  293  K  (room  temperature).42  These  changes  could  affect  the

dynamics of the phase transition although the change in melting temperature is small compared

to the overheating induced by the laser in the interaction region.

VI.  CONCLUSION

In this paper, the reversible phase transition in a Gallium film irradiated by femtosecond

laser  pulses  has  been  studied  by  measuring  its  transient  reflectivity  with  one  pump  and  two

identical  simultaneous  femtosecond  probes  set  at  two  different  angles.    These  measurements

allowed  complete  determination  of  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the  transient  dielectric

function with ~ 200 fs time resolution and from these the electron-phonon effective collision rate

(optical or transport frequency) and heat conduction coefficient for the first 25ps after irradiation.

The time-dependent electron and lattice temperatures in the layer undergoing the phase transition

were  then  determined.  The  time  history  of  the  phase  transition  in  Gallium  induced  by

femtosecond laser pulses was reconstructed on the basis of the experimentally measured transient

effective electron-phonon collision frequency in the first 25 ps after the excitation with ~200 fs

time resolution.

25

The main results of this study are the following:

• 

femtosecond laser excited α-Ga transforms into a phase state whose optical properties are

intermediate between those for the crystal and for the liquid Gallium.  This state is a most

likely  a  coexistence  of  different  phases  of  Gallium,  possibly  α-Gallium  and  liquid

Gallium.

•  The main reason for incomplete phase transformation after the femtosecond laser pulse

excitation is the limited thickness of the laser-excited layer.  At the energy threshold for

the reflectivity change the size of a seed of a new phase is comparable to the skin depth.

Correspondingly, the phase transformation terminates during the cooling stage after the

laser pulse when the seed size is approaches to the thickness of the excited zone.  This

makes  the  laser-excited  phase  transition  drastically  different  from  the  phase

transformation in a bulk solid in the conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium.

•   The  experimentally  determined  threshold  for  the  reflectivity  changes,  0.5-0.7  mJ/cm2,

corresponds to the absorbed energy density two times lower than the equilibrium enthalpy

of melting for Gallium.

•  The electron-phonon collision rate and the heat conduction coefficients recovered from

the experimental data are transient non-linear functions of temperature, and are drastically

different from those in equilibrium.

•  The first sharp rise in reflectivity in a few ps after the excitation corresponds to the fast

growth  of  seeds  of  new  phase  whilst  the  electron  heat  conduction  is  negligible.    The

following  slow  increase  in  reflectivity  corresponds  to  the  conditions  when  the  heat

transfer dominates.  The lattice cooling through the electron heat conduction slows down,
and than terminates the solid-to-liquid phase transformation on 100-200 ps timescale.7

•   The  measured  changes  in  the  linear  (specular)  reflection  occurs  on  the  timescale  of

several picoseconds or greater.  The phase transition therefore proceeds in the thermal

mode.

The non-thermal stage of the phase transition or, the coherent displacement, takes place

during  the  time  comparable  to  the  150-fs  pump  duration  and  could  not  be  resolved  in  these

experiments  with  200-fs  resolution  presented  here.    The  coherent  displacement  of  the  lattice

excited by the laser pulse on a time-scale shorter than the electron-phonon energy exchange time
(< 100 fs), can be studied in future experiments combining ultra-short optical and X-ray probing1

with  time  resolution  better  than  100  fs.    These  experiments  would  lead  to  a  precise

characterization of the non-equilibrium stage of the laser-excited phase transition.

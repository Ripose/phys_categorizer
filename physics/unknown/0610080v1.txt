ABSTRACT 

 
Large  spherical  scintillation  detectors  are  playing  an  increasingly  important  role  in  experimental 
neutrino physics studies. From the instrumental point of view the primary signal response of these 
set-ups  is  constituted by the time and amplitude of the anode  pulses  delivered by each individual 
phototube following a particle interaction in the scintillator. In this work, under some approximate 
assumptions, we derive a number of analytical formulas able to give a fairly accurate description of 
the most important timing features of these detectors, intended to complement the more complete 
Monte  Carlo  studies  normally  used  for  a  full  modelling  approach. The  paper  is  completed  with  a 
mathematical  description  of  the  event  position  distributions  which  can  be  inferred,  through  some 
inference algorithm, starting from the primary time measures of the photomultiplier tubes.

1. Introduction 

Contemporary  large  liquid  scintillator  detectors  represent  the  latest  evolution  of  a  mature 
technology which has been, since its introduction, a key player in the particle detection arena. The 
rather easy possibility to accumulate large detection mass at not prohibitive costs makes the choice 
of  massive  scintillation  detectors  particularly  attractive  for  the  field  of  neutrino  physics,  where 
indeed a variety of scintillator set-ups for supernova neutrino detection [1] and for reactor neutrino 
oscillations  [2][3]  [4]  [5]  have  been  designed,  installed  and  operated  over  the  past  two  decades. 
Furthermore,  in  the  solar  neutrino  field  the  massive  spherical  detectors  Borexino  [6]  and 
KamLAND  (solar  phase)  [7]  are  actively  pushing  toward  an  imminent  start  of  data  taking  in  the 
background challenging sub-MeV region, while ambitious plans are being shaped to ensure a future 
to the SNO apparatus as a multipurpose scintillator neutrino observatory [8]. 

In the early days of the development of the scintillation technique a big deal of studies were 
devoted  to  the  theoretical  and  experimental  investigation  of  the  timing  features  of  scintillation 
counters  (i.e.  assemblies  of  scintillators  and  phototubes),  reaching  a  fairly  accurate  description  of 
the timing properties of counters of modest size (see for example [9][10] [11]).  

Despite the complexity associated with the size, the signal characterization in large set-ups 
in principle can follow approaches similar to those adopted in small scintillation equipments, since 
also large detectors comprise essentially, in this respect, the same two major components, i.e. the 
scintillator  in  which  the  interactions  occur  and  through  which  the  light  propagates,  and  the 
phototubes dedicated to the acquisition of the scintillation photons. 

From a  pure instrumental  point  of  view, the detector signal response to the  interactions of 
interest  corresponds  to  the  ensemble  of  photoelectron  signals  delivered  by  each  individual 
phototube:  specifically,  the  two  quantities  of  relevance  characterizing  the  output  pulses  are  the 
number  of  photoelectrons  by  which  they  are  formed  and  the  timing  evaluated  with  respect  to  a 
common trigger pulse. From these primary measures then the physical quantities of interest of each 
interaction  in  the  detector  are  computed,  essentially  the  energy  of  the  events  and  their  spatial 
location. 

The  full  understanding  of  the  detector  response  implies  normally  an  integrated  twofold 
approach: a thorough Monte Carlo modelling, as accurate as possible, of the light production and 
transport phenomena from the interaction site to the detecting photomultipliers, complemented by 
an “in-situ” source calibration of the detector. In the particular case of special interest of spherical 
geometry,  a  preliminary,  basic  understanding  of  the  overall  detector  response  can  be,  however, 
gained  through  some  simple  geometric  formulas  which,  although  cannot  replace  the  need  for  a 
complete Monte Carlo modelling, can help to get an immediate realistic picture of the performance 
of  the  whole  device,  especially  for  what  concerns  the  time  distributions  of  the  phototube  pulses. 
Purpose  of  this  work  is  to  show  in  details  the  derivation  of  these  formulas,  which  practically 
represent  a  sort  of  “zero  order”  description  of  the  performances  of  a  large  spherical  scintillation 
counter. 

The paper is organized as follows : since it has been mentioned that the phototube timing in 
a real set-up is related to a common trigger, as introduction to the whole problematic in paragraph 2 
the well known issue of the random trigger rate from a coincidence arrangement of a plurality of 
PMT’s  is  reviewed;  then  in  paragraph  3  some  general  considerations  on  the  timing  in  large 
scintillation counters are given, defining also the limit of validity of the derivations presented in the 
subsequent  paragraphs.  In  paragraph  4  it  is  considered  the  timing  response  of  a  single  PMT 
observing a spherical detector characterized by a uniform distribution of events, while in paragraph 
5 the case of a uniform surface distribution of events is considered. In paragraph 6 it is illustrated in 
detail the special case in which the detector is characterized by an index of refraction discontinuity, 
as for example when the scintillation vessel is surrounded by a shielding liquid of different nature. 
In paragraph 7 it is addressed the complementary issue of the photoelectron time sequence detected 
by the phototube lattice as response to an event occurring in a generic location inside the detector, 
being  the  calculation  done  in  both  cases  of  single  refraction  index  and  two  refraction  indexes.  In 

 

2

paragraph  8  the  description  of  the  timing  features  is  completed  with  a  digression  concerning  the 
expected fluctuation of the trigger pulse derived from the coincidence criterion of NF PMT’s firing 
in a predefined window. 

In the second part of the paper it is faced the question of the estimated radial distributions of 
the  event  locations,  as  derived  from  the  primary  time  distributions.  Actually,  this  problem  is 
addressed without considering in details the procedure to infer the spatial location estimate from the 
time  information  (for  this  purpose  see  for  example  [12]),  but  it  is  assumed  that  the  estimation 
process results in Gaussian resolution functions affecting equally each individual spatial coordinate 
(x, y, z), and it is then illustrated how such estimates combine to produce the estimated radial event 
distributions in various cases of interest. Preliminarily, in paragraph 9 it is demonstrated what are, 
individually,  the  global  x,  y  and  z  expected  distributions  in  case  of  a  class  of  events  uniformly 
distributed  in  the  vessel.  Then  in  paragraph  10  the  estimated  radial  profile  of  point  like  events  is 
derived, while in paragraph 11  the  same type of distribution is obtained for  uniformly distributed 
events, and in paragraph 12 for external events. Finally, in paragraph 13 there are the conclusions. 
 
2. Random coincidence rate 

The trigger condition in a large self-triggering scintillation detector viewed by NT PMT’s is 
normally set by requiring a certain number NF of concurrently firing phototubes within a predefined 
time window of length T. Such a length is defined to be comparable with the photon time of flight 
across  the  whole  volume  of  the  detector,  while  NF  is  fixed  through  a  trade-off  between  the 
minimum  desirable  energy  to  be  observed  and  the  rate  of  the  random  triggers  due  to  the  fake 
coincidences originated by the dark noise pulses emitted by the tubes. The problem is an issue when 
the phototubes work in the single photoelectron regime, since in that case the noise pulses and the 
signal  pulses  are  indistinguishable.  In  order  to  fix  properly  NF  it  is  needed  to  know  the  formula 
which governs the rate of false occurring triggers. 

T

N

Since  a  trigger  occurs  when  NF  out  of  the  total  NT  devices  fire,  we  have  as  many  trigger 
configurations as the number of the groups of NT PMT’s grouped in classes of dimension NF, i.e. 
⎛
⎜⎜
⎝
configuration  we  have,  given  a  PMT  firing  as  first  among  the  NF  of  that  configuration,  that  the 
probability  of  the  remaining  (NF-1)  PMT’s  to  fire  within  a  time  window  T  from  the  first  is 

. Assuming for simplicity that all the PMT’s feature the same dark noise rate r, then for each

, from which by multiplying by r we get the rate, i.e. 

r
. Actually, this is 
the rate due to the considered configuration, but with one specific PMT firing as first; the overall 
rate  is  thus  obtained  considering  that  any  of  the  NF  tubes  can  be  the  first,  which  implies  that  the 
previous rate is multiplied by NF, i.e. 
. Finally, taking into account all the possible 
PMT’s configurations, one obtains as overall random coincidence rate R

Essentially the same formula can be found, for example, in [13]. 

For  a  given  number  of  total  PMT’s  NT,  Eq.  (1)  is  a  sharply  varying  function  both  of  the 
number NF of phototubes in trigger and of the rate r. This is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 1, where 
we plot the relation (1) for a detector characterized by NT equal to 2200 and by a coincidence time T 
equal to 50 ns (for a realistic example, these numbers adhere to the features of the solar neutrino 
Borexino detector [6]). The five curves in the figure, which correspond to five different values of 
the PMT’s dark rate (chosen in the more likely range of the Borexino PMT’s), i.e. 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 
kHz, give the random trigger rate expressed in events per day for an increasing number of PMT’s in 
trigger from 1 to 20. Initially the rate is extremely high, since in the naïve condition of only 1 PMT 
in trigger the random rate is obviously equal to the number of PMT’s multiplied by the individual

dark rate; the random rate becomes negligible even for the highest rate of 4 kHz, however, already 
with only 14-15 PMT’s in trigger.

This result implies that the threshold imposed by the requirement to keep to a minimum the 

random trigger rate does not represent, in practical case, a real limitation on the low energy 
response of a scintillation detector. 
  
3. General timing considerations in large scintillation counters 

As  mentioned  in  the  introduction,  when  referring  to  the  timing  features  in  scintillation 
counters  one  implicitly  means  the  characteristics  of  the  time  distributions  of  the  photoelectrons 
revealed by the observing phototubes as response to an interaction occurring inside the scintillator. 
These  features  depend  upon  a  multiplicity  of  factors:  the  intrinsic  scintillation  decay  time  of  the 
scintillator  [9],  the  time  of  flight  (TOF)  of  the  photons  through  the  detector  prior  to  arrive  to  the 
phototubes, which takes into account the geometrical extension of the detector itself, as well as the 
attenuation,  absorption  re-emission  and  scattering  effects  along  the  photon  path,  and  finally  the 
timing in the photomultipliers along the conversion process of the photons into photoelectrons and 
the subsequent multiplication throughout the dynode chain [14]. 

It should be reminded that the absorption re-emission effect stems from the overlap of the 
emission  and  absorption  spectra  of  the  scintillation  medium,  so  that  a  photon  can  undergo  self-
absorption followed by a subsequent re-emission [15]. The process is quite complex, and its main 
effect  is  to  enhance  the  tails  of  the  timing  distributions.  In  previous  works  [16]  and  [17]  it  was 
shown a mathematical procedure able to deal with the absorption re-emission effect and to quantify 
its  impact  on  the  overall  timing  properties.  On  the  contrary,  in  this  work  the  focus  is  on  the 
determination of the TOF geometrical factors in different hypotheses of intrinsic event distributions, 
but under the simplifying assumption of neglecting the absorption re-emission effect (as well as the 
scattering), and including at most the simple attenuation effect. 

Since the overall photoelectron time at the output of each phototube is the sum of the factors 
listed above, its global probability density function (PDF) is the convolution [18] of the individual 
distributions pertaining to each factor. For the purpose of the examples in this work, the scintillation 
decay  profile  is  assumed  equal  to  that  of  the  scintillation  mixture  (Pseudocumene+PPO  at  1.5g/l) 
adopted for the Borexino solar neutrino experiment, while the PMT time response is modeled as a 
Gaussian distribution with sigma equal to 1 ns. In the following paragraphs it will be always shown 
the TOF factor resulting from the calculations related to the various cases under consideration, and, 
when  useful  to  illustrate  better  the  obtained  results,  it  will  be  shown  also  the  convolution  of  the 

 

4

derived TOF factor with the scintillation curve and the PMT response. It will be also clear, along 
the  calculations,  that  the  simple  attenuation  effect,  when  considered,  will  imply  essentially  a 
modification of the TOF term. 
 
4. Time distribution detected by a phototube for a uniform volume distribution of events 

Let’s  consider  (Fig.  2)  a  spherical  volume  of  radius  R  of  liquid  scintillator  with  events 
uniformly distributed in it. We want to evaluate the time distribution that such events induce on a 
PMT  observing  the  volume,  neglecting  the  absorption  re-emission  and  scattering  effects.  If  we 
consider a polar coordinate system centered on the PMT, given a point characterized by coordinates 
l, θ  (θ  is  the  angular  coordinate  orthogonal  to  the  plane  of  the  figure  and  this  is  why  it  is  not 
reported in the figure itself) and φ, we have that the probability that a scintillation event occurs in 
the infinitesimal volume around such a point (shaded area in the figure) is

and the probability that a photon emitted from this point hits the phototube is

In order to obtain the relation (9), it is taken into account that, from the triangle formed by R, 

l, and Zpm (see again Fig. 2), the angle φmin is given by  

One  may  wonder  which  is  the  meaning  of  the  surface  element  dS  which  appears  in  (9). 
Specifically, it means that the integral of (9) over l gives the probability to detect a photon over the 
unit surface in correspondence to the phototube, so that the further integral over the whole detecting 
surface  (i.e.  the  sphere  of  radius  Zpm  covered  by  the  observing  phototubes)  gives  1.  Since  the 
detection  probability  for  unit  surface,  for  obvious  symmetry  reasons,  is  uniform  over  the  entire 
detecting sphere, such an integral is equivalent to multiply by the area of the sphere of radius Zpm 
(we do not consider here the obvious fact that in a practical arrangement the detecting sphere is only 
partially covered by the lattice of PMT’s). 

The  above  calculation  neglects  the  attenuation.  For  a  more  realistic  result  also  the  self-
attenuation effect of the scintillator should be considered. Assuming, as it is in many actual set-ups, 
that  the  same  attenuation  process  occurs  inside  the  vessel  and  in  the  path  from  the  vessel  to  the 
phototube, it is enough to consider a multiplicative exponential factor so that eq. (9) becomes

The time distribution for unit surface (eq. (12) omitting the factor dS) is plotted in Fig. 3 for 
R=4.25  and  Zpm=6.52;  these  geometrical  parameters  correspond  to  those  of  the  solar  neutrino 
experiment  Borexino.  The  two  plots  correspond  respectively  to  either  ignoring  or  including  the 
attenuation  effect,  with  an  attenuation  length  taken  for  the  purpose  of  the  example  equal  to  7  m. 
Since in Borexino the inner containment vessel will be immersed in the same solvent used as base 
of the scintillator (Pseudocumene) the latter calculation is that more realistic.

5. Time distribution detected by a phototube for a uniform surface distribution of events 

The evaluation of the time of flight distribution induced by a uniform surface distribution of 
events proceeds similarly to the procedure illustrated in the previous paragraph. With reference to 
Fig.  4  one  can  note  that  the  events  characterized  by  a  same  path  to  arrive  to  the  PMT  are  those 
comprised  in  the  elementary  surface  subtended  by  the  angle  dθ.  Taking  into  account  the  circular

symmetry of the problem, the area of this surface can be written as

6. Time distribution detected by a phototube for a uniform volume distribution with 
refraction at the boundary 

An unusual situation which requires to modify the calculation in paragraph 4 is that in which 
the surrounding medium is different from the scintillator solvent, being typically water, instead. In 
this case there is refraction at the boundary which greatly complicates the evaluation of the time of 
flight at the phototube.  

As depicted in Fig. 6, the ray emitted from the event point is bended at the boundary of the 
two mediums. Since the refraction index of the inner medium (scintillator) is lower than that of the 
outer medium (water) the direction of the ray is bended so to increase the angle with the radius of 
the  sphere  drawn  through  the  incidence  point.  The  evaluation  of  the  time  distribution  at  the 
phototube can be done numerically, since a closed form formula cannot be written. The numerical 
evaluation  proceeds  through  two  steps:  the  first  is  the  determination  of  the  optical  path  from  the 
generic event site to the phototube, the second is the construction of the overall distribution from 
the individual path lengths. 

Fig.6 - Geometrical derivation of the time of flight distribution detected by a PMT observing a 
spherical detector characterized by a uniform internal distribution of scintillation events and with 
light refraction at the boundary 
 

The construction in Fig. 6 has the purpose to illustrate the determination of the optical path. 
Given B the event point, the path traveled by the photon to arrive to the PMT is the sum of the two 
segments  l1  and  l2  shown  in  the  figure.  In  the  adopted  reference  coordinate  system,  B  has  the 

 

 

10

generic coordinates x and y and the abscissa of the PMT is Zpm. The direction of the radius passing 
through B is specified by the angle β. The incident angle is denoted as γi, the refraction angle as γr, 
the angle formed by the photon with respect to the radius passing through B is denoted as σ. The 
straight  distance  from  the  point  B  to  the  PMT  is  obtained  via  the  cosine  theorem  applied  to  the 
triangle OBP

In order to compute the right path l1+l2 bringing the photon from the event site to the PMT, 
an iterative procedure is adopted: many trial values of the angle σ are tried (starting from 0) and for 
each of them the following values are computed :

Time (ns)

Fig. 7 - Time of flight distribution induced on an observing phototube by a uniform distribution of 
events in the scintillation vessel in the case of two different medium (scintillator and water). The 
example has been computed for the parameters characterizing the CTF detector. For reference 
purpose the distribution in case of absence of refraction (dashed curve) is also reported 
 

The light paths from all the points of the sphere can be properly grouped to form the overall 
distribution  of  the  time  of  flight  to  the  PMT.  Taking  into  account  the  spherical  symmetry  of  the 
problem,  it  is  enough  to  consider  a  grid  of  calculation  points  in  a  semicircle  of  the  sphere  itself: 

 

 

11

assuming a certain binning for the time of flight distribution to be derived (for example 0.2 ns) each 
path corresponding to a point of the grid is converted into a bin number, and to the content of the 
bin so identified it is added a factor which represents the weight of the calculated path. Since each 
point of generic coordinates x, y actually stands for an entire circular corona of radius y (in the sense 
that all the points comprised in this corona produce the same path to the phototube), the first factor 
in the weight is simply the volume of such a corona, i.e. 2πy∆x∆y, being ∆x and ∆y the widths of the 
cells of the grid. 

The second factor in the weight gives the probability that the photon actually impinges the

In  practice dS  is  omitted,  as  above,  and  the  calculation  are  referred  to  the  unit  area  of  the 

A  detector  in  which  the  refraction  effect  is  important  is  the  Counting  Test  Facility  (CTF) 
[19], prototype of the above mentioned Borexino detector. In CTF the inner vessel (R=1) containing 
the  scintillator  with  refraction  index  equal  to  1.5,  is  surrounded  by  water  (refraction  index  1.33). 
The output of the determination of the TOF factor with these parameters (and considering that in 
CTF  the  phototubes  are  located  at  Zpm=3.3  from  the  centre)  is  shown  in  Fig.  7,  where  for 
comparison it is reported also the time of flight distribution that would result if the two mediums 
were  the  same  (with  ns=1.5)  everywhere.  The  shift of  the  two  curves  is  due  to  the  systematically 
longer optical path in the latter situation, due to the assumption of having in the whole detector the 
medium with the higher refraction index. Besides this, in the refraction case the curve appears also 
distorted with a sort of “missing portion”. This peculiar shape is actually linked to the presence of 
points  in  the  vessel  which  are  missed  by  the  phototube,  in  the  sense  that  the  light  rays  emerging 
from them cannot find a path suitable to reach the observing phototubes because of the refraction 
effect, which can also give rise to a light trapping at the border. For completeness, in Fig. 8 the map 
of the obscured points is reported.  

Fig. 8 – Map of the points inside the CTF vessel for which an observing PMT is blind

In  this  respect  it  is  interesting  to  point  out  that,  if  the  distribution  is  referred  to  the  whole 
detecting surface through an integration which is equivalent to a multiplication by the area of such a 
surface, the re-scaled distribution will have an integral, less than 1, which gives the fraction of the 
sphere which is not obscured. In the present CTF example this fraction amounts to 91.3%. 

If  required,  in  the  procedure  described  in  this  paragraph  it  can  be  included,  as  well,  the 
attenuation effect, by introducing in the weight (25) the appropriate exponential factors containing 
l1 and l2, depending upon the actual physical situation. In the CTF example this correction has not 
been included for the twofold reason that the attenuation outside is negligible, because the medium 
is water, and inside is negligible also, because of the limited size of the detector. 

Finally, it must be mentioned that as a cross-check, the procedure adopted in this paragraph 
has  been  applied  to  the  case  of  same  index  of  refraction  everywhere,  obtaining  a  distribution 
coinciding with the correct curve described by eq. (12) (without the attenuation factor). 
 
7. Time profile of single events 

Up to now we have considered how a single phototube detects the time distribution of the 
photons  coming  from  a  uniform  (or  surface)  distribution  of  events  in  the  scintillator  containment 
vessel.  An  alternative  distribution  of  interest  is  how  the  photons  from  a  specific  event  site  are 
distributed in time. Essentially, this is the opposite situation: instead of evaluating the distribution 
induced on a single PMT’s by an ensemble of events, we are now interested to the time distribution 
on all the PMT’s of the detection times of the photons induced by a single interaction site.  

Fig. 9 – Geometry for the derivation of the time of flight distribution recorded by a detecting sphere 
of radius Rd as response to a localized interaction in the scintillator 
 

Again we neglect the absorption and re-emission effect and limit ourselves to consider the 
“zero order” effects, due to the geometry and to the attenuation process. The calculation in the next 
two  paragraphs  takes  into  account  two  different  situations:  either  same  scintillation  medium 
everywhere or two different mediums inside and outside the vessel. In both cases the first step of 
the calculation is the determination of the “time of flight” factor (TOF), which in this situation is the 
distribution of the arrival times to the detecting sphere (i.e. the lattice of phototubes) of the photons 

 

 

13

as if released in an ideal instantaneous scintillation process; the second step is the convolution of the 
TOF term with the intrinsic scintillation decay curve and the response of the PMT in order to obtain 
the overall time distribution of the detected photoelectrons. 
 
7.1 Same index of refraction 

With  reference  to  Fig.  9,  where  the  emission  point  is  denoted  with  Zev,  the  generic  arrival 
point with P, and the path traveled by the photon with l, if there is no absorption the time of flight 
distribution  of  the  photons  arriving  to  the  detecting  sphere  of  radius  Rd  is  determined  by  pure 
geometrical arguments. 

Indeed it is obvious that the distribution of the time of flight is dictated by the distribution of 
the  solid  angle Ω.  Specifically,  the  photons  emitted  in  the  infinitesimal  solid  angle  dΩ  will  be 
characterized by the same time of flight. Hence we have to transform the probability that a photon is 
emitted between Ω and Ω+dΩ, in the probability that its time of flight is comprised between tf and 
tf+dtf.  

To  do  this  we  have  to  use  the  relationship  between Ω  and θ,  the  vertex  angle  of  the  cone

Through the comparison of eq. (28) with eq. (33) we realize that the probability density function of 
the flight path of the not absorbed photons is 

We can transform the last expression (34) in probability density function of the time of flight 

by the usual transformation l=(c/n)tf, thus obtaining  

Eq. (35) is valid on a limited interval of values of the variable tf; indeed the minimum value 
of  the  time  of  flight  corresponds  to  the  path  (Rd-Zev)  and  the  maximum  to  (Rd+Zev).  The  eq.  (35) 
hence is valid for

It can be easily checked that, as expected, the integral of eq. (34) over l (or equivalently the 

integral of relation (35) over tf) is equal to 1. 

To account for the attenuation effect, the distribution (35) must be corrected, as done for the 

distributions in paragraphs 4 and 5, introducing an exponential factor, therefore obtaining

The TOF factors (35) and (36), with reference to the geometrical parameters of the Borexino 
detector, are plotted in Fig. 10 for 3 different positions in the vessel (1, 2.5, 4.25 m): it is evident 
that  the  broadening  effect  due  to  the  geometry,  obviously  more  pronounced  for  locations  of  the 
events  closer  to  the  boundary,  is  accompanied  by  a  peculiar  peaking  of  the  time  distributions  at

shorter  values.  The  curves  including  the  attenuation  effect,  evaluated  assuming  an  attenuation 
length  of  7  m,  feature  a  very  similar  shapes  to  those  unaffected  by  the  attenuation;  their  integral, 
which  is  less  than  1,  is  physically  meaningful  and  gives  the  probability  of  a  photon  to  reach  the 
detecting surface without being absorbed. 

 

7.2 Case of index of refraction discontinuity 

With reference to Fig. 11, in case of two different mediums the overall time distribution of 
the  photons  impinging  upon  the  detecting  sphere  (i.e.  the  sphere  of  the  phototubes)  is  obtained 
numerically following a procedure similar to that used in paragraph 6. Preliminarily it is evaluated, 
for each angle θ, the light path l1+l2. Practically, the evaluation is carried out for a fine grid of θ 
values,  with  a  step ∆θ  which  can  be  done  as  small  as  desired.  The  flight  time  for  each θ is  then

where the exponential term represents the probability of the photon of being not absorbed within the

The TOF distribution, evaluated according the prescription just illustrated, is plotted in Fig. 
12  for  5  different  radial  positions  in  the  CTF  vessel  (due  to  the  limited  size  of  the  detector,  the 
attenuation factor in this case has been dropped from the weight). It is interesting to note the effect 
due to the total internal reflection for the points close to the border: essentially there is a central gap 
in the time distribution due to the missing trapped photons. For display purpose the curves are all 
normalized to unit area. While this normalization is the right one for the curves not affected by the 
light  trapping,  this  is  not  true  for  the  last  two  curves  exhibiting  the  trapping  effect.  It  must  be 
pointed  out  that  the  calculation  as  carried  out  provides  in  principle  for  them  the  proper 
normalization, thus leading to an integral that gives correctly the fraction of not trapped photons.

Fig. 12 – Time of flight distributions of the photons released by events located, respectively, at 0.2 
m, 0.4 m, 0.6 m, 0.9 m and 1 m from the centre of the CTF detector; it should be noted the gap in 
the  distributions  affected  by  the  light  trapping,  as  well  as  the  very  peaked  characteristic  of  the 
second part of these distributions  
 

Another peculiarity of the trapped curves is the sharp peak that they feature at the beginning 
of  their  second  part.  Given  this  fact,  it  may  be  interesting  in  this  case  to  carry  out  explicitly  the 
calculation to go from the TOF distributions of the photons to the actual detected distributions of 
the photoelectrons, according to the sequence of convolution operations outlined in paragraph 3.  

The  results  of  the  convolution  of  the  TOF  terms  in  Fig.  12  with  the  intrinsic  scintillation 
light  profile  and  the  phototube  timing  response  (we  remind  that  we  adopt  for  the  sake  of  the 
example the quantities valid for the Borexino project) are reported in Fig. 13. Also in this case the 
curves are all normalized to 1 for the purpose of comparison. The interesting result is that for the 
trapping related curves the double peak feature of the photon time of flight is maintained also in the 
final photoelectrons distributions, being the second peak more prominent than the first.  

 

17

For  the  purpose  of  completeness  the  TOF  distribution  is  reported  in  Fig.  14  taking  into 
account  both  the  attenuation  factor  and  the  proper  normalization  due  to  the  light  trapping,  in  the 
three  cases  of  event  position  at  0.2,  0.6  and  1  m.  In  correspondence  of  each  position  the  curves 
relevant  to  the  two  different  situations  of  attenuation  included  or  not  included  are  plotted. 
Obviously, for points well inside the vessel the only photon loss effect is that due to the attenuation: 
for the 0.2 m position the fraction of photons lost for the attenuation is 13.1 %, and at 0.6 m is 11.5 
%. For points close to the boundary the loss of light due to the trapping is more important than the 
loss caused by the attenuation; for example for the position at 0.9 m the light trapping causes a loss 
in  terms  of  photons  of  17.2%,  while  the  attenuation  causes  and  additional  loss  of  only  7%, 
essentially  concentrated  in  the  second  part  of  the  curve.  As  shown  in  the  figure,  the  first  part  is 
unaffected  by  the  attenuation  since it  is  relevant  to  photons  which  fly  across  the  scintillator  for  a 
short path.

8. Trigger fluctuation 

As explained in paragraph 2, the trigger condition in a large scintillation counter is obtained 
by requiring the firing of a certain number NF of PMT’s in a suitable time window chosen on the 
basis of the detector extension. Obviously, with respect to the ideal 0 time of the actual occurrence 
of the event, the trigger time is affected by a fluctuation dictated by the statistics of the coincidence 
process. In the evaluation of the time sequence of the photoelectrons produced in a single event, this 
amount simply to an overall common shift of the time base; instead in the evaluation of the global 
time distribution detected by a single photomultiplier for a uniform volume or surface distributions 
of  events  this  effect  has  an  overall  distortion  impact  due  to  the  fact  that  the  time  measurements 
which are added together to create the global distribution are not referred to a same fixed 0 time but 
are  referred  to  a  fluctuating,  and  hence  different  on  an  event  by  event  basis,  trigger  time.  This 
implies,  in  particular,  that  the  actual  measured  TOF  distribution  is  the  convolution  of  the  trigger 
time distribution with the TOF ideal factor determined in the previous paragraphs. 

It is, thus, of interest to find a way to compute the trigger fluctuation. This can be done, with 
a good degree of approximation, profiting of the known formulas describing the photon statistics in 
scintillation  counters  [20]  [21].  Specifically,  there  are  two  applicable  formulas  in  case  that  one 
considers events comprising either a fixed or a fluctuating numbers of photoelectrons. In the former 
case, given the probability density function of the photon production in the scintillator p(t), then the 
probability  of  the  time  of  production  of  the  ith  photon  out  of  n  photons  exactly  originated  in  a 
scintillation event is

In the latter case, considering Poisson fluctuating events, the applicable formula is 

In  the  original  contest  in  which  they  are  derived,  these  formulas  are  related  to  the  photon 
timing in a scintillator characterized by the scintillation light profile p(t). Since in the present case 
we are interested to the detection time of the photoelectrons as delivered by the phototubes, then the 
p(t) functions to be considered are the time profiles for single events as derived in paragraph 7: in 
fact, it is on the sequence of photoelectrons that obey to those curves (we remind that they amount 
to the convolution of the intrinsic scintillation light, the PMT response and the TOF factor, with or 
without the attenuation term) which is applied the coincidence criterion for the trigger derivation.  

It can be instructive to evaluate for some special cases of number of detected photoelectrons, 
thus  exploiting  the  formula  (42),  and  for  few  points  inside  the  scintillation  vessel,  the  resulting 
trigger fluctuation. For example, considering a detector like Borexino, in which one can expect of 
the order of 20 PMT’s in coincidence over a time window of 50 ns as trigger condition, it can be 
assumed as trigger distribution that of the detection time of the 20th photoelectron, as derived from 
the  formula  (42).  Clearly  this  is  an  approximation  which  is  valid  if  the  total  number  of 
photoelectrons is significantly high, since it is equivalent to assume that the photoelectron number 
20  occurs  within  the  first  50  ns  window.  In  case  of  a  number  of  photoelectrons  not  much  higher 
than  the  trigger  condition,  it  can  happen  that  either  in  a  substantial  fraction  of  events  the  trigger 
condition is not met or that it is met, but not in the first 50 ns window.  

In  this  case  the  evaluation  of  the  trigger  time  could  be  done,  besides  obviously  through  a 
Monte  Carlo  calculation,  following  a  sliding  window  approach  which  leads  to  a  scan  statistics 
calculation, which however is beyond the purpose of the present paper.

(44). 

The  trigger  distributions  in  these  conditions,  for  50  detected  photoelectrons  and  for  5 
different radial position are reported in Fig 15. As intuitively expected, the dispersion of the trigger 
time is higher for events located at increasing radial distances from the center of the detector. Also, 
it appears that there is a shift on the mean value of the trigger time distributions depending upon the 
actual radial location of the events, with the events closer to the border causing obviously an early 
triggering  with  respect  to  those  more  central.  By  computing  eq.  (42)  for  increasing  numbers  of 
photoelectrons it appears that the trigger fluctuation curves shrink significantly, and also that their 
absolute shift with respect to the true 0 time decrease, since more photoelectrons induce obviously 
an early trigger occurrence.

9. Single coordinate distribution for uniform events 

The sequence of the photoelectron detected times studied in the previous paragraphs can be 
used  to  infer  “a-posteriori”  the  spatial  location  of  the  originating  event.  A  thorough  maximum 
likelihood  procedure  for  this  purpose  has  been  studied  for  example  in  [12].  In  this  “inverse 
problem”  framework  the  studies  of  the  previous  paragraphs  can  be  extended  deriving  some 
interesting  results  concerning  the  expected  spatial  coordinates  distribution  of  the  events  in  some 
special cases. The main variable of interest is r, the radial coordinate of the location of the events, 
but it can be useful to show also the expected distribution of the individual x, y and z coordinates in 
the special case of uniform distribution of events. Let’s consider for this purpose that the probability 
for an event to be in the elementary volume dxdydz, in a spherical volume of radius R, is simply

from which, by integrating over y and z, it stems the probability of the variable x to be between x

If the detection system (i.e. the lattice of the PMT’s) is spatially uniform similar results are 

valid for the y and z coordinates, too. 

So, if the detector is not affected by biases or systematic effects, a uniform distribution of 
events  would  result  in  parabolic  distributions  of  the  three  spatial  coordinates.  Moreover,  if  the 
spread  in  the  reconstruction  process  of  the  event  coordinates  is  characterized  (as  it  is  usual)  by  a 
Gaussian  profile,  then  the  distribution  of  the  reconstructed  Cartesian  coordinates  is  simply  the 
convolution of the Gaussian resolution function with the parabolic function (53). 

Eq. (53) and its convolution with the Gaussian spread are plotted in Fig. 16 for the case of a 
vessel  of  1  m  radius  and  assuming  a  resolution  (sigma)  of  20  cm.  Interestingly,  the  convolution 
effect  is  to  change  marginally  the  bulk  of  the  parabolic  distribution,  while  adding  two  side  tails 
whose extent is determined by the width of the resolution function. 
 
10. Reconstructed distribution of point-like events 

Again in this paragraph we do not consider how the event location is inferred starting from 
the  sequence  of  the  times  of  the  detected  photoelectrons,  but  we  assume  simply  that  such  a 
procedure  leads  to  estimates  of  the  x,  y  and  z  coordinates  which  are  all  three  characterized  by  a 
Gaussian  uncertainty.  What  we  want  to  show  here  is  how  these  estimates  combine  to  give  the 
quantity of interest, i.e. the probability density function of the radial distance r of the event from the 
center  of  the  detector.  To  this  purpose  we  follow  closely  the  derivation  illustrated  in  [18]. 
Alternative approaches are also possible, like for example that reported in [22]. 

Let’s  consider  the  joint  probability  that  the  estimated  coordinates  are  located  around  a 

generic point of coordinates x, y, and z. We can then write

In Fig. 17 the expected radial distribution of point like events located at r=0, r=0.4 and r=0.8 

in a generic scintillator vessel of 1m radius are reported. 

The  sigma  for  the  x,  y  and  z  variables  assumed  in  the  calculation  is  equal  to  0.15  m.  For 
events  located  in  the  center  the  most  probable  estimated  radial  position  is  .0.21  m,  for  events 
located at 0.4 m is 0.45 m, and for events located at 0.8 is 0.83. So, the more the events are far from 
the centre, the more the peak position of the radial distribution is close to the true event location.

Eq. (59) is applicable also in the case in which it is needed to perform spatial correlation of 

different events. In particular, if two events originate from the same location (as in special 
radioactive decay correlated sequences) the radial distance of the corresponding estimates obeys to 
relation (59), with the caveat that the sigma to be introduced is that affecting the individual 
coordinates multiplied by √2. 
 
11. Reconstructed distribution of uniform events 

From relation (56) it can be inferred the radial distribution of events uniformly distributed in 
the vessel. For this purpose it is enough to multiply eq. (56) by the density of the events as function 

 

23

of r0 (the true radial event position, scanning the whole vessel) and then integrate the result over r0 
itself. Furthermore, because of the spherical symmetry, it can be assumed without loss of generality 
x0=r0, y0=0 and z0=0. Hence, since the probability density function of r0 is

The expected distribution stemming from eq. (61) is reported in fig. 18 for the case of the 

CTF vessel. 

In Fig. 18 it is displayed also the r2 geometrical distribution. Interestingly, in the core of the 
vessel the two distributions coincide, while it is close to the boundary that the effect of the finite 
resolution manifests with a tail of events whose location is estimated outside the physical region of 
the containment vessel.  
 
12. Reconstructed distribution of external events 

A  calculation  similar  to  that  of  previous  paragraph  can  lead  to  the  evaluation  of  the 
estimated  distribution  of  external  events  (external  in  the  sense  that  they  are  induced  inside  the 
scintillator by gamma rays originated by radioactive contaminants in the surrounding medium), in 
the  reasonable  assumption  that  the  actual  position  of  such  events  follow  an  exponential  decaying 
profile  inward  from  the  vessel  wall.  Thus  in  this  case  the  probability  density  function  of  these 
events can be written as

13. Conclusions 

The  time  and  the  associated  event  position  distributions  in  scintillation  detectors  can  be 
accurately  studied  through  detailed  Monte  Carlo  modeling.  In  the  special  case  of  spherical 
geometry, however, useful formulas can be derived to give an approximate analytical description of 
the  detector  signal  responses,  which  can  usefully  complement  the  more  precise  Monte  Carlo 
outputs.  In  this  paper  we  have  given  a  thorough  account  of  their  derivation  for  several  cases  of 
practical interest.

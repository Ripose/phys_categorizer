Abstract: In this letter we present a new technique for pulse shaping. The 
desired pulse is shaped by two apodized chirped fiber Bragg gratings which 
dispersions  are  adjusted  to  be  cancelled.  This  technique  exploits  the  well-
known  property  of  linearly-chirped  gratings,  in  which  the  apodization 
(amplitude)  grating  profile  maps  its  spectral  response.  This  technique 
presents  inherent  advantages  of  chirped  fiber  Bragg  gratings  and  direct 
design in frequency domain.

1. Introduction 
Optical  pulse  shaping  and  manipulation  are  critical  features  for  ultrafast  optics,  playing  a 
central  role  in  the  area  of  optical  communication.  For  many  years,  various  all-optical 
techniques  has  been  deployed  to  deal  with  this  task.  In  the  framework  of  free-space  optics, 
different pulse shaping techniques based on spatial masking have been proposed [1]. In these 

works,  the  authors  report  impressive  results,  but  the  inherent  free-space  optics  limitations 
restrict  this  approach.  Alternative  techniques  based  on  Arrayed  Waveguide  Gratings  [2]  or 
fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) have been proposed. 

In  this  paper,  we  focus  our  attention  on  optical  pulse  shaping  using  FBGs,  which  have 
been used as frequency-filtering stages in some pulse-shaping applications [3-6]. Under Born 
approximation  the  design  process  is  widely  simplified  because  the  corresponding  reflection 
temporal  impulse  response  is  directly  related  to  the  apodization  profile.  On  the  other  hand, 
Born approximation includes a limitation of the strength of the grating and the length of the 
output pulse. These limitations can be avoided by using grating synthesis algorithms, such as 
inverse-scattering  and  layer-peeling  techniques  [7,8],  but  these  algorithms  do  not  always 
ensure  the  feasibility  of  the  resulting  grating  profile.  Chirped  FBGs  have  also  been  used  in 
optical  pulse  shaping  [9],  [10]  with  high  reflectivity  without  the  limitations  previously 
commented.  In [9] a technique for repetition-rate multiplication and pulse reshaping by use of 
an  apodized  chirped  FBG  is  proposed.  Apodization  profile  is designed  for  spectral  shaping, 
and dispersion is designed to cause Talbot effect [11], so that this approach only works at a 
discrete  set  of  pulse  train  rates.  In  [10]  the  apodization  profile  is  directly  related  to  the 
reflective  temporal impulse  response  amplitude,  but  a quadratic phase term is  added,  which 
limits its use to insensible phase systems. 

In this letter a technique based on chirped FBGs is presented. As it can be seen in Fig. 1, 
the  system  includes  two  chirped  FBGs  connected  by  an  optical  circulator.  Under  high 
dispersion  regime,  the  apodization  profile  of  an  FBG  is  directly  related  to  its  spectral 
response. The first grating provides the spectral amplitude for pulse shaping, and the second 
one  is  a  dispersion  compensator  [12],  which  cancels  the  dispersion  introduced  by  the  first 
grating. A similar architecture, two oppositely chirped FBGs, has been previously proposed in 
CDMA [13]. In this approach, phase-shifts are introduced in the spectra of the output signal to 
generate  spectral-phase-encoded  bit,  but  no  considerations  about  the  amplitude  of  the 
apodization profile or the spectral amplitude are made.

which are connected by an optical circulator.  

 

2. Theory 
At  this  point,  we  introduce  the  theoretical  basis  needed  to  design  the  system.  Suppose  a 

linearly chirped FGB with reflected spectral response

is the angular frequency, R(ω) is the reflectivity, and 
n(z) can be written as:

where nav(z) represents the average refractive index of the propagation mode, ∆nmax describes 
the maximum refractive index modulation, A(z) is the normalized apodization function, Λo is 
the  fundamental  period  of  the  grating,  φ(z)  describes  the  additional  phase  variation  (chirp), 
and z ∈  [0,L] is the spatial coordinate over the grating, with L the length of the grating.  

In the following we consider a constant average refractive index nav= neff+ ∆nmax, where 
neff is the effective refractive index of the propagation mode.  The additional  phase variation 
,  where  Ck  represents  the  chirp  factor, 
can  be  expressed  as

where  c  is  the  light  vacuum  speed,  and  ∆ωg  is  the  grating  bandwidth.  In  high  dispersion 
regime,  both  the  temporal  and  spectral  response  of  an  FBG,  have  been  proved  to  have  the 
same envelope [14]. This high dispersion condition can be expressed as:

where  ∆t  is  the  temporal  length  of  the  inverse  Fourier  transform  of  the  spectral  response 
without the dispersive term, which is approximately equal to the temporal length of the pulse 
reshaped. From (3) and (4)  we can deduce that the shorter temporal length of the  pulse, the 
shorter minimum length of the grating. Notice that the length of the grating is not fixed, but 
limited  by a mimimum, so the length of the grating can be longer that this minimum length. 

If  condition  (4) is met and Born  approximation is  applicable, both temporal and spectral 
envelopes  reproduces  the  shape  of  the  apodized  function,  so  we  can  obtain  the  apodization 
profile which corresponds to a desired reflectivity Rd(ω) [9], that can be written as: 

where ω0 is central angular frequency and Ã(ω) is related to the apodization function as:

where the sign of ± is equal to the sign of Ck. In the case of high reflectivity an approximate

As  instance  we  design  a  system  in  which  gaussian  pulses  from  a  short  pulse  source  are 
reshaped  in  triangular  ones.  We  assume  a  carrier  frequency  (ωo/2π)  of  193  THz.  Each 
Gaussian input pulse has an FWHM of 0.7496 ps, and the total desired width for the reshaped 
triangular  pulse  is  10  ps.  Thus,  the  spectral  function  for  the  input  and  output  pulses  are

We  consider  a  band  of interest  (∆ω/2π)  of  2  THz  centred at  ω0 (ω0-∆ω/2  ≤  ω  ≤  ω0+∆ω/2).

4. Conclusion 
In  this  paper,  we  have  presented  a  spectral  pulse  shaping  technique  based  on  a  pair  of 
oppositely  chirped  FBGs.  The  necessary  theoretical  basis  for  designing  the  FBGs  has  been 
developed.  Also, we show an example which reshapes Gaussian  pulses into triangular  ones. 
Numerical simulation confirms the validity of this approach. 

We  want  to  remark  that  although  this  architecture  has  been  previously  proposed  to 
introduce phase shifts in the spectra of a pulse  for CDMA [13], this is the first time, to our 
knowledge, that it has been used to reshape the spectral amplitude of a pulse. 

This approach has the inherent advantages of FBGs over non-FBGs techniques. Although 
some  FBGs  pulse  shaping  techniques  (such  as  Super-structured  FBGs)  have  become 
extremely sophisticated, two main features can make our novel approach interesting. Firstly, 
since shaping is made in the spectral domain, it can be very fitting when the desired shape is 
much simpler in the spectral domain. Secondly, in other techniques, the length of the grating 
is fixed by  the temporal length of the desired  reshaped pulse. Thus, there is  an unavoidable 
technological limit when the temporal length is very short, specially if we have a complicated 
temporal shape. In contrast, in  our technique, the length of the grating is  limited  by  a given 
minimum value, without limitation to present a longer length. Therefore, this novel approach 
presents less technological restrictions in many cases.

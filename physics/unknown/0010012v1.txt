Summary
The finite-difference time-domain method was employed
to simulate light propagation in tapered near-field fiber
probes with small metal aperture. By conducting large-
volume simulations, including tapered metal-cladding
waveguide and connected optical fiber waveguide, we il-
lustrated the coupling between these guiding modes as well
as the electric field distribution in the vicinity of the aper-
ture. The high collection efficiency of a double-tapered
probe was reproduced and was ascribed to the shortening
of the cutoff region and the efficient coupling to the guid-
ing mode of the optical fiber. The dependence of the effi-
ciency on the tapered structure parameters was also ex-
amined.

1. Introduction

Improvement of the optical throughput and

collection efficiency of aperture probes is the most im-

portant issue to be addressed for the application of near-

field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) in optical re-

cording, fabrication, and manipulation as well as spectro-

scopic studies. The tapered region of the aperture fiber

probe is considered to be the metal-cladding optical

waveguide, whose propagation properties are character-

ized by the cutoff diameter and the absorption coefficient

of the cladding metal. Through systematic experimental

studies, it has been confirmed that the transmission effi-

ciency decreases in the region where the core diameter is

smaller than the wavelength of the propagating light. On

the basis of this finding, we proposed to shorten the nar-

row metal-cladding region with strong optical losses by

making a double-tapered structure with a large cone angle.

This structure is easily realized using a multi-step chemi-

cal etching technique. It has been demonstrated that the

transmission efficiency is much improved by 1-2 orders

of magnitude as compared to the single-tapered probe with

a small cone angle (Saiki et al., 1996).

Further optimization of the tapered structure is

needed to achieve much higher probe efficiency. How-

ever, it is very time-consuming to assess many structure

parameters, such as the cone angle and taper length, by

trial and error. Numerical analysis is a more reasonable

way to attain an optimized structure efficiently and to un-

derstand the electromagnetic field distribution in a tapered

waveguide including the vicinity of the aperture. Compu-

tational calculation by the finite-difference time-domain

(FDTD) method is the most popular and promising method

available for this purpose (Furukawa & Kawata, 1996;

Nakamura et al., 2000), because it can be easily applied

to actual three-dimensional problems. Although there have

been many simulations focusing on the electric field dis-

tribution in the vicinity of the aperture to examine the spa-

tial resolution of NSOM, no calculations have been re-

ported dealing with the light propagation in the tapered

region in terms of the sensitivity of the probe. In this pa-

waveguide. The refractive indices of the core and clad-

per, using the three-dimensional FDTD method, we dem-

ding of the fiber are 1.487 and 1.450, respectively. The

onstrate the high collection efficiency of double-tapered

probes including guiding optical fibers, as compared with

intensity of the collected signal, Icoll is evaluated by two-
dimensionally integrating the electric field intensity in the

single-tapered probes. We also examined the dependence

core area of the optical fiber. The simulation box consists

of the collection efficiency on the cone angle and taper

length in detail.

pole current linearly polarized along the x direction. The

radiation caught by the aperture with a diameter of l/5

propagates in the tapered region clad with a perfectly con-

ducting metal and then is guided to the optical fiber

mic scale. In Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), Icoll is compared for probes
with θ=28˚ and θ=90˚. The Icoll ratio is estimated to be
1:32. Such a distinct improvement in Icoll can be attributed
to the difference in the length of the cutoff region. By

ing mode of the optical fiber, while the spherical wave-

like propagation in Fig. 2(b) cannot be coupled to the guid-

ing mode so efficiently. To summarize, the collection ef-

ficiency of the double-tapered probe in Fig. 2(c) is greater

than Icoll in Fig. 2(b). The radiation pattern in Fig. 2(c)

of a double-tapered probe, its performance should be de-

pendent on various structure parameters. In Figs. 3(a) and
3(b), the values of Icoll as a function of cone angle θ and
neck diameter D, respectively, are plotted The enhance-
ment of Icoll with the increase in θ can be understood rea-
sonably. Icoll will increase monotonously as θ approaches
180˚. In the case of a realistic metal aperture, however, a
large θ will cause diminished spatial resolution due to the
finite skin depth of the metal. The optimum value of θ
should be chosen by balancing the collection efficiency

with the spatial resolution. As depicted in Fig. 3(b), the

dependence of Icoll on D is found to be more complicated
and seems to be less essential. One significant result is

that a neck diameter D as small as dc is more preferable,
compared with D~2 dc, to attain high efficiency in cou-
pling to the guiding mode of the optical fiber.

4. Summary

FDTD simulation demonstrated the perfor-

mance of a double-tapered probe, whose collection effi-

ciency was found to be greater by two orders than that of

a common single-tapered probe. Such high efficiency

could be explained as follows: (1) by shortening the cut-

off region of the metal-cladding waveguide, much radia-

tion was directed into the probe; (2) by introducing a guid-

ing region, smooth coupling to the optical fiber was

achieved. We also examined the collection efficiency as a

function of structure parameters. Dependence on the cone

angle was evident as expected; the efficiency increased

monotonously with the cone angle. On the other hand, the

relationship between the efficiency and the neck diameter

was found to be complicated. Further study, focusing on a

more realistic situation, introducing a complex dielectric

constant of the cladding metal, is now in progress.

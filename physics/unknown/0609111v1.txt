ABSTRACT  
Among the parameters influencing stone deterioration, moisture and water movements through 
the pore network are essential. This communication presents differents methods to characterize 
stones  and  to  determinate  the  water  transfer  properties.  Results  are  analysed  for  two 
limestones  having  similar  total  porosity,  but  characterized  by  different  pore  networks.  These 
different porous systems govern dissimilar water properties. 
 
KEY WORDS  
Tuffeau, Sébastopol stone, porosity, pore size distribution, imbibition. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
Water plays a fundamental role in the phenomena of stone deterioration. The understanding of 
water  movements  within  the  pore  network  of  stone,  which  affect  the  behaviour  of  porous 
materials, are essential. The study of porous media and water transfer in fresh stones is a first 
step  in  order  to  analyse  and  to  model  deterioration  process.  In  this  paper,  two  sedimentary 
limestones  are  chosen.  The  first  one,  called  tuffeau,  is  a  stone  commonly  used  in  most  of 
monuments built along the Loire valley in France. Meanwhile, it is necessary to note the great 
diversity of the tuffeau family (important variability of minerals proportion and porosity [1]). 
So, studied tuffeau is tuffeau of Saumur, extracted from an underground quarry, and the other 
one, Sébastopol stone, is obtained from a quarry near Paris.  
 
 
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE STUDIED STONES  
 
THE SOLID PHASE  
The  mineralogical  composition  of  studied  stones  is  obtained  by  several  complementary 
techniques : X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopies, thermogravimetric analysis, 
ICP, EMPA coupled with analysis from optical microscopy. 
 
In tuffeau and Sébastopol stone as in many sedimentary rocks, the main crystalline phases are 
calcite CaCO3 and silica SiO2 in the form of quartz. But other minerals are found in the tuffeau 
as clays (e.g. glauconie which appears greenish in optical microscopy) and micas visible to the 
naked  eye,  and  especially  another  crystalline  form  of  silica  named  opal cristobalite-tridymite 
(opal  CT).  It  is  also  interesting  to  note  the  presence  of  a  small  quantity  of  minerals  which 
appear with a metal luster as seen in optical microscopy. Indeed, very small grains of titanium 
oxyde  TiO2  are  found  rather  uniformly  spread,  both  in  the  tuffeau  and  the  Sébastopol  stone. 
Other detritic minerals like zircon are also found in small grains spread in the Sébastopol stone.

Calcium  carbonate  is  distributed  among  sparitic  and  micritic  calcite,  and  fossil  shells.  The 
calcite proportion is quantified using the mass loss resulting from calcite decomposition around 
700°C. The weight ratio of CaCO3 is 49.6% for tuffeau and 79.5% for Sébastopol stone. So, 
one  can  classify  Sébastopol  stone  as  a  limestone  while  the  tuffeau  should  be  classified  as  a 
siliceous limestones [2]. 
 
The grain morphology is determined from SEM images on fragments of stones (Figs. 1 and 2). 
The  difference  in  the  grain  sizes  for  the  two  stones  is  clearly  observed.  The  grains  of  the 
Sébastopol stone, as well as the marine fossils being there, are rather homogeneous and large, 
while size and shape of the constituent grains of the tuffeau are varied but finer. Indeed, due to 
the  multi-phase  aspect,  tuffeau  is  constituted  with  grains  of  very  different  sizes  and  shapes. 
One  can  find  in  the  tuffeau  rather  voluminous  grains  of  quartz,  but  also  aggregates  of  small 
crystals of micritic calcite, small fossil shells, and objects formed during the sedimentation: the 
opal CT spherules with their characteristic surface [3]. The texture of stones observed by SEM 
images allows to see the complexity of the porous network generated with these grains.

THE POROUS PHASE  
The  pore  space  is  investigated  by  various  methods  like  mercury  porosimetry,  BET 
measurements and 2D images analysis. 
The  porosity  is  determined  from  dry  bulk  and  skeletal  densities  measured  by  hydrostatic 
weighing  (table  1).  Measurements  by  Helium  pycnometry  confirm  these  results  (ρs  =  2.53 
g/cm3 for tuffeau and ρs = 2.70 g/cm3 for Sébastopol stone). Values of total porosity are near 
45%  for  both  stones,  which  indicates  that  these  stones  are  highly  porous  and  so  particularly 
light building materials.

Mercury porosimetry give information about pore sizes distribution (Figs. 3 and 4). For both 
stones, results are dissimilar: tuffeau has a very wide range of pore sizes (from 20 µm to 7 nm), 
which demonstrate clearly the multi-scale nature of tuffeau pore space relative to Sébastopol 

6th International Symposium on the Conservation of Monuments in the Mediterranean Basin 

stone [2], whereas the major part of pore sizes for Sébastopol stone is restricted from 40 µm to 
1 µm.  
 
The  total  porosity  are  nearly  the  same,  but  due  to  differences  between  mineralogical 
constitution,  grain  sizes  and  shape  arrangements,  their  pore  space  structure  are  completely 
different. Sébastopol stone is constitued with large grains, so the pore space is large. Tuffeau is 
constitued  by  various  small  grains  with  various  morphologies  like  clays,  micas,  opal  CT 
spherules.  The  arrangement  of  larger  grains  generate  macro-porosity,  and  micro-porosity  is 
formed by the finest phases’ morphology and arrangement.

The backscattered SEM images of polished cuttings allow to show the various kinds of pores 
(Figs.  5  and  6).  These  images  give  additional  information  to  those  obtained  by  the  mercury 
porosimetry technique: for Sébastopol stone, the size of major pores is near 20 µm whereas the 
SEM photograph show several pores with a diameter near 100 µm. This is mainly due to the 
shape  hypothesis  and  the  model  of  cylindrical  pores  in  mercury  porosimetry  analysis.  And, 
there is also the “ink-bottle” effect which reduces the volume of the large pores to the benefit 
of  small  pores  [4].  The  term  diameter  in  mercury  porosimetry  is  then  very  relative  as  it 
characterizes  only  the  entry  diameter  to  the  pore  access.  This  effect  is  more  visible  for 
Sébastopol  stone  because  the  large  pores  seem  be  connected  by  narrowings  proportionately 
smaller compared to tuffeau.

These  classical  methods  will  be  completed  with  3D  images  obtained  by  X-ray  tomography. 
Indeed, this tool allows to get informations about the connectivity and the topology of the pore 
network. Furthermore, 3D information will be useful for the modeling of water transfer in the 
porous  media.  Finally,  NMR  is  also  informative  to  investigate  the  liquid  water  diffusion 
coefficient and consequently determine the tortuosity of pore network. 
 
 
WATER TRANSFER PROPERTIES  
 
The water retention measurement gives information about the ability of the stone to trap water 
from its atmospheric environment (Figs. 7 and 8). In this experiment, samples previously dried 
at 105°C were placed in atmospheres of different constant relative humidities kept by saturated 
salt solutions.

The tuffeau traps easily the humidity from air and can then contain a lot of water mainly for the 
highest humidities. This is due to the important micro-porosity and to the presence of clayey 
minerals. In comparaison, the Sébastopol stone adsorbs very few amount of water, and even in 
very wet atmospheres, the stone remains practicaly dry. This behaviour is due to the absence of 
clay minerals and to a pore distribution almost exclusively constituted with very large pores. 
These  water  retention  measurements  can  be  completed  up  to  saturation  by  means  of  others 
techniques  like  osmotic  solutions  (polyetylene  glycol)  and  tensiometric  plates,  imposing 
smaller capillary pressures [5].  
 
The  macroscopic  water  movement,  essential  for  deterioration  study,  is  mainly  due  to  liquid 
water  transfer.  And  this  water  is  absorbed  by  capillary  imbibition.  The  phenomenon  of 
capillarity is directly related to the pore network characteristics: pore sizes and pore shapes, but 
also the connectivity and the topology of the porous structure. 
Theoretical capillary model [6] is based on absorption by capillarity for a vertical cylindrical 
tube  of  limited  height  (allowing  to  neglect  gravity).  The  Washburn’s  equations  give  the 
capillary height (h) and the mass uptake (dm) per surface unit (S) during an elapsed time (t):

where η is the kinematic water viscosity and σ is its superficial tension. 
 
In this test, samples, in contact with water, are weighed and the height of the capillary front are 
measured according to the elapsed time. In spite of the cylindrical capillary approximation, the 
curves of capillary ascent and mass uptake drawn according to the square root of the elapsed 
time (not shown here) are linear. This indicates that the pore network is homogeneous [7]. 
These stones have relatively high capillary kinetics (table 2) comparated to less porous stones 
with smaller pore diameter [8], but the imbibition coefficients of the Sébastopol stone are about 
2  times  higher  than  those  of  the  tuffeau.  This  confirms  the  influence  of  pore  size  on  the 
imbibition  kinetics.  These  results  should  be  correlated  to  SEM  images,  the  Sébastopol  stone 
possesses larger pores relative to those of the tuffeau. 
 
Imbibition  leads  also  to  determine  the  anisotropy  of  these  porous  media  (table  2).  The 
imbibition  kinetics  being  faster  in  the  direction  parallel  to  the  bedding  direction.  The 
Sébastopol stone presents a capillary anisotropy of about 20 %, while the tuffeau presents an 
anisotropy of about 15 %.

This  liquid  water  transfer  study  will  be  completed  with  vapour  transfer  analysis  by 
determination  of  evaporation  kinetics  and  diffusion  experiments.  Measurements  of  water 
vapour  diffusion  are  carried  out  according  the  water  content  at  steady  state.  This  allows  to 
calculate vapour diffusion coefficient and hydraulic conductivity variations as a function of the 
degree of saturation of stones [9]. 
 
 
FINAL REMARKS  
In  spite  of  similar  total  porosities,  these  two  stones  possess  very  different  pore  size 
distributions.  This  induces  different  behaviours  relative  to  water.  Indeed,  tuffeau  and 
Sébastopol  stone  are  very  porous  limestones,  with  a  total  porosity  near  45%.  But,  the 
morphology of the solid phase and the porous phase are very dissimilar. Most of the grains of 
Sébastopol stone are large, whereas grains of tuffeau are smaller and varied with different size 
and shape (sparitic and micritic calcite, clay, mica, opal CT spherules). The arrangement of the 
grains in Sébastopol stone is mainly restricted to macropores whereas tuffeau has a very wide 
range of pore sizes with a relatively important micro-porosity. This difference is observed in 
the water retention curve and imbibition properties. The tuffeau traps easily humidity from air 
whereas  Sébastopol  stone  is  absolutely  not  hygroscopic.  However  imbibition  kinetics  of 
Sébastopol stone are about 2 times higher. 
To understand stone deterioration, it is necessary at least to study water transfer properties of 
the  stones  and  water  effect  on  them.  And,  to  understand  its  water  transfer  behaviour,  it  is 
necessary to understand first the geometry of its porous phase.

Abstract
A  vectorial  analysis  of  magnetic  resonance  spectrometers,  based  on  traveling  wave
resonators  and  including  the  reference  arm  and  the  automatic  control  of  frequency,  has
been  developed.  The  proposed  modelization,  valid  also  for  stationary  wave  resonators,
gives  the  response  function  of  the  spectrometer  for  any  working  condition,  including
scalar  detectors  with  arbitrary  responsivity  law  and  arbitrary  excitation  frequency.  The
purely  dispersive  and  purely  absorptive  linear  responses  are  discussed  in  detail  for
different  scalar  detectors.  The  developed  approach  allows  to  optimize  the  performances
of  the  spectrometer  and  to  obtain  the  intrinsic  lineshape  of  the  sample  in  a  very  broad
range  of  working  conditions.  More  complex  setups  can  be  modelized  following  the
proposed scheme.

I.  INTRODUCTION

Since  the  discovery  of  Whispering  Gallery  Modes  (WGM)  by  Lord  Rayleigh  at  the
beginning  of  the  20th  century  [1],  resonant  structures  based  on  these  traveling  wave
modes  have  been  widely  used  in  different  fields  of  physics  [2,  3,  4].  An  effective
employment of such devices requires otherwise an accurate modelization of the resonator
and  of  the  overall  apparatus.  Among  the  different  applications,  an  innovative  realization
of  magnetic  resonance  spectrometers  based  on  dielectric  resonators  working  on  WGM
has  been  recently  proposed,  specifically  useful  for  high  magnetic  field  applications  [5].
The  basic  aim  of  this  paper,  which  generalizes  a  previous  investigation  [6],  is  the
theoretical  prediction  of  the  response  of  this  class  of  spectrometers  under  general
hypotheses. In particular, it will be calculated the complex response of the spectrometer,
being  amplitude  and  phase  of  the  radiation  expressed  in  terms  of  the  parameters  of  the
spectrometer. This approach is justified by the availability of vectorial analyzers working
up  to  the  THz  region  [7];  obviously  the  complex  analysis  exhaustively  defines  the
response of the spectrometer also when scalar detectors are used.

The developed analysis will focus on the relevant aspects of the coherent response of
the  spectrometer  (i.e.  the  response  calculated  not  accounting  for  any  noise  effects),  in
which  the  resulting  signal  is  completely  defined  by  the  parameters  controlled  by  the
operator. The effects of the different sources of noise, which are beyond the scope of this
work, can be included  a posteriori. The generality of the proposed approach, based only
on  the  complex  resonance  frequency  and  on  the  coupled  energy,  makes  inessential  any
further details about the employed resonator. As a consequence, the obtained results can
be  directly  applied  to  spectrometers  based  on  different  kinds  of  resonators,  such  as
metallic  cavities  and  Fabry-Perot  resonators;  indeed,  the  main  findings  obtained  in  the

1

classical  work  of  Feher  [8]  will  be  reproduced.  In  this  respect,  the  work  represents  a
complete  analytical  approach  to  the  complex  response  of  a  magnetic  resonance
spectrometer,  including  also  a  reference  arm  and  the  automatic  control  of  frequency;
moreover all the usual working parameters and conditions are considered.

The practical determination of the effects of a sample interacting with the resonator is
developed,  for  sake  of  simplicity,  by  using  a  perturbative  approach.  To  this  purpose  a
generalization  of  the  celebrated  Boltzmann-Ehrenfest  theorem  [9]  is  used.  The  above
procedure  always  leads  to  a  linear  behavior,  which  can  be  considered  as  the  intrinsic
response  of  the  spectrometer.  On  the  other  side,  the  use  of  scalar  detectors  can  lead  to
non-linear response in specific conditions.

The application of the obtained results to a typical working condition will be discussed

and experimentally verified in a forthcoming paper.

The  plan  of  the  paper  is  the  following.  Section  II  reports  the  main  properties  of  a
traveling  wave  resonator  coupled  to  a  transmission  line,  also  in  presence  of  a  reference
arm. In Section III are discussed the effects of a perturbation of the resonator in terms of
the variation of its complex resonance frequency. In Section IIIa the perturbed resonance
frequency is derived in terms of magnetic permittivity by means of a generalization of the
Boltzmann-Ehrenfest  theorem.  The  vectorial  response  of  the  magnetic  spectrometer  is
discussed  in  Section  IV.  The  obtained  results  are  specialized  to  the  case  of  scalar
detectors  with  arbitrary  responsivity  law  in  Section  V.  In  Section  VI  the  absorptive
response  in  linear  regime  is  discussed  in  detail  for  different  scalar  detectors.  Finally,
concluding remarks are given in Section VII.

II.  GENERAL BACKGROUND

The  vectorial  modelization  of  a  traveling  wave  resonator,  coupled  to  a  general
transmission line in the reaction configuration, can be effectively developed in terms of a
circuit formed by a directional coupler and a phase shifter [10], as schematically shown in
Fig. 1.

amplitudes  at  the  different  reference  planes  can  be  obtained  using  the  method  of  the
scattering  matrix  [10,  11].  In  order  to  have  a  purely  traveling  wave  in  the  resonator,  the

, where  a   is  the  attenuation  of  the  wave  and  j   its  phase  shift  in  a  round

represents the imaginary unit. According to this model, the critical coupling coefficient  kc
(given by the condition  b = 0) is obtained when

               (4).

In  particular  all  the  coupling  conditions  up  to  the  critical  one  (and  beyond)  can  be
described  in  this  approximation.  The  following  analysis  will  be  developed  according  to
the  described  framework,  which  includes  indeed  all  the  usual  working  conditions  [12].
The effects of the stationary waves that can be induced by the sample will be neglected.

It  is  worthwhile  to  note  that  the  proposed  modelization  also  applies  to  conventional
2a~  entering
standing wave resonators excited in reflection configuration, when the signal 
~
1a~  and 
the port 2 is disregarded. Indeed, in this case the wave amplitudes 
  represent
2b
the incoming and the reflected wave respectively, and the scattering matrix preserves the
same  form  which  results  only  from  the  energy  conservation  principle  (Chap.  4  of  Ref.
13).  Accordingly,  the  proposed  modelization  will  be  valid  for  a  wide  class  of  resonant
structures. Moreover, the model can be generalized in order to include a reference arm, as
usual in EPR experiments; the related circuit is sketched in Fig. 2.

III.  PERTURBED RESONATOR

The  theoretical  analysis  of  the  response  of  a  magnetic  resonance  spectrometer,
employing a vectorial detector and based on resonators excited in reaction or in reflection
configuration, can be reduced to the analysis of the circuits described in Fig. 1 and in Fig.
2. The presence of a sample modifies the parameters of the resonator when the magnetic
resonance  is  swept  across.  In  turn,  these  modifications  change  the  amplitude  of  the
forward wave, as described by Eq. 1 or Eq. 5a. The knowledge of the complex response
function  of  the  spectrometer  is  then  traced  back  to  the  knowledge  of  the  effects  of  the
magnetic resonance on the parameters of the resonator. To this purpose, the analysis will
start  by  the  description  of  the  basic  circuit  represented  in  Fig.  1;  the  effects  of  the
reference arm will be considered later.

In  the  most  general  approach,  the  knowledge  of  the  complex  magnetic  permittivity

expansion  of  the  complex  response  will  be  retained;  the  obtained  behavior  can  then  be

If  the  excitation  frequency  coincides  with  the  resonance  frequency,  as  occurs  when  an

.  If  otherwise  the
excitation  frequency  is  fixed  and  differs  by  a  constant  value  from  the  resonance
frequency,  the  imaginary  part  of  JD   becomes  a  nonvanishing  constant  independent  of
the magnetic field.

The  frequency  variation  induced  by  a  perturbation  in  a  system  oscillating  at  the

Boltzmann-Ehrenfest theorem, which ensures that [9]

If  an  ideal  lo ssless electromagnetic system (ideal resonator) is considered, the change
of its mean stored energy is due to the variation of the (real) magnetic permittivity  mD .

As  the  magnetic  resonance  experiments  are  in  general  performed  using  scalar
detectors,  the  scalar  response  of  the  spectrometer  will  be  analyzed  in  detail  in  the  next
section. In this case, in spite of the linearity of the complex signal 
 in terms of the
magnetic  susceptibility,  a  non  linear  response  can  arise  due  to  the  non  linearity  of  the
employed  detector.  Moreover,  the  effects  of  a  reference  signal  can  be  particularly
prominent.

In  order  to  allow  a  compact  analysis  of  the  scalar  response  of  the  spectrometer  it  is
useful to introduce a vector formalism in which a complex number  c  corresponds to a 2-

dimensional vector

In general the analysis of the scalar response of the system requires a direct use of the

basic Eq. 18.

Relevant from a conceptual point of view appears the condition of ideal compensation,
0 =
;  in  this  case  the  overall  forward  wave  is  just  given  by  the  contribution  of  the

r
b t
magnetic resonance, and Eq. 18 reduces to

0

)
the obtained lineshape thus non-linearly mixes the dispersive and absorptive components
of  cˆ .  This  mixing  can  be  avoided  by  using  the  AFC  system,  which  cancels  out  the

the  critical  coupling  point  distorted  lineshapes  are  in  general  obtained  also  for  linear

VII.  CONCLUSIONS

In  conclusion,  a  vectorial  analysis  of  the  response  of  a  spectrometer  for  magnetic
resonance  based  on  traveling  wave  resonators,  including  also  the  use  of  a  reference  arm
and/or  AFC  system,  was  developed.  This  approach  starts  from  the  analysis  of  the
attenuation  and  the  dephasing  of  the  wave  traveling  in  the  resonator,  instead  of  from
usual  RLC  lumped  circuits  representation.  The  approach  appears  highly  general,  being
valid  also  for  any  stationary  wave  resonator  as  well  as  for  non-magnetic  samples.  The
developed  complex  analysis  allows  in  particular  to  exploit  the  potentialities  of  the
vectorial detection, which has been already proved effective [7, 19].

The complex response has been specialized also to the use of scalar detectors, in which
the  inherent  linear  behavior  can  give  distorted  lineshapes;  the  proposed  approach  allows
anyway to extract the intrinsic lineshape of the sample in any working conditions.

Finally, the knowledge of the response function of the spectrometer for any excitation
frequency  allows  the  analysis  of  more  complicated  setups,  as  in  the  case  of  bistability
phenomena in electron paramagnetic resonance experiments [20].

Practical  applications  of  the  proposed  model  will  be  discussed  and  experimentally

verified in a forthcoming paper.

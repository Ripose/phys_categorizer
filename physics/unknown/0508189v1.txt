Abstract : We present a nonlinear dynamical model for DNA thermal denaturation, which is 

based  on  the  finite  stacking  enthalpies  used  in  thermodynamical  nearest-neighbour 

calculations.  Within  this  model,  the  finiteness  of  stacking  enthalpies  is  shown  to  be 

responsible  for  the  sharpness  of  calculated  melting  curves.  Transfer-integral  and  molecular 

dynamics  calculations  are  performed  to  demonstrate  that  the  proposed  model  leads  to  good 

agreement with known experimental results for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous DNA.

Study of the separation of the two strands of DNA upon heating, a phenomenon called 

denaturation or melting, is a subject which has a long history [1,2], because it is a preliminary 

step  for  the  understanding  of  transcription.  From  the  experimental  point  of  view,  the 

examination  of  UV  absorption  spectra  of  diluted  DNA  solutions  reveals  that  denaturation 

occurs  through  a  series  of  steps  as  a  function  of  temperature  [3].  These  jumps  suggest  that 

large  portions  of  the  inhomogeneous  DNA  sequence  separate  over  very  short  temperature 

intervals, which is of course reminiscent of first-order phase transitions. Various models have 

been  developed  along  the  years  to  investigate  this  point.  So  far,  two  different  mechanisms 

have  emerged,  which  could  potentially  be  responsible  for  a  first-order  phase  transition. 

Peyrard  and  Bishop  (PB)  have  shown,  by  studying  dynamical  models  based  on  non-linear 

Hamiltonians [4,5], that it is sufficient to consider a weaker stiffness for single stranded DNA 

compared to double stranded DNA to observe a first-order phase transition [6]. On the other 

hand, studies relying on the statistical Poland-Scheraga (PS) model [7] lead to the conclusion 

that  excluded  volume  effects  can  induce  a  discontinuous  transition,  even  when  stiffness  is 

neglected [8]. 

The  main  purpose  of  this  article  is  to  show  that  the  sharpness  of  the  DNA  melting 

transition may also be due to the finiteness of the interaction between stacked base plateaux. 

This interaction, which originates partly from the overlap of the π electrons of the bases and 

partly  from  hydrophobic  interactions,  necessarily  vanishes  when  two  successive  bases  have 

slid  on  each  other  far  enough  for  their  rings  not  to  be  superposed  any  longer.  This  point  is 

correctly  taken  into  account  in  both  the  statistical  PS  models  [7]  and  the  nearest-neighbour 

thermodynamic  ones  [9],  while  in  the  PB  models the  stacking  energy  goes  to  infinity  when 

the  separation  between  the  rings  goes  to  infinity.  It  will  precisely  be  shown,  that  a 

Hamiltonian model based on the finite stacking energies, which are routinely and successfully 

used in thermodynamic calculations [10], displays a sharp first-order-like transition. A further 

 

2 

advantage of using thermodynamic stacking energies is that the proposed microscopic model 

describes  homogeneous  and  inhomogeneous  DNA  sequences  on  the  same  footing  and  with 

equal success, as will be shown by comparing experimental and calculated melting curves. 

In  the  PB  models  [4,5],  which  have  been  used  to  unravel  many  aspects  of  melting 

[6,11,12], DNA is described as a one-dimensional chain, where hydrogen bonds in base pairs 

(bp) are assumed to be Morse potentials, while stacking energies are taken into account in the 

form of nearest neighbour potentials :

where  ny  represents the transverse stretching of the hydrogen bond connecting the nth pair of 

to describe stacking interactions [5]. They showed that the anharmonic model (

0>ρ ) leads 

to  denaturation  curves  in  much  better  agreement  with  experiment  than  the  harmonic  one 

(

0=ρ ).  It  also  displays  qualitatively  different  properties  [5,6,11],  including  a  first-order 

phase  transition  [6].  The  tentative  explanation  is  that  the  variable  backbone  stiffness 

introduced by the additional term gives more cooperativity to the melting process. However, 

the interaction potential of Eq. (2) does not take into account the fact that stacking interactions 

are 

necessarily 

finite. 

A

potential, 

which

,  where 

H∆

  is  the  (finite)  stacking  energy. 

This is the first interaction potential we used and all the results presented below also hold for 

this potential (in particular, it leads to very sharp denaturation curves and to singularities in 

the temperature evolution of the specific heat and the entropy, which validates the conclusion 

drawn below that the finiteness of stacking interactions may be responsible for the sharpness 

 

3 

of  melting  curves).  However,  we  later  modified  it  for  two  reasons.  First,  we  replaced  the 

min

( )

  function  by  a  more  physical  exponential  switching  function.  Moreover,  for  this 

potential,  the  thermal  separation  of  the  two strands  is  accompanied  by  the  breaking  of  each 

strand  into  many  small  pieces,  that  is,  one  observes  large 

y

  values  in  addition  to 

large  ny  ones. This artifact was cancelled by adding a small term, which models the stiffness 

of the sugar/phosphate backbones. The interaction potential we propose is thus of the form

It is emphasized that the numerical value which will be assumed for 

bK  is very small (2000 

times  smaller  than  PB's  K  parameter),  so  that  the  corresponding  term  keeps 

y

  to 

reasonable  values  without  affecting  the  melting  dynamics.  Note  also  that 

ny   is  no  longer 

considered as a pure stretching coordinate in Eq. (3). Indeed, unstacking of two consecutive 

bases certainly involves some rotation of the bases in the planes perpendicular to the strands. 

Therefore,  ny  is meant to describe in some global manner the separation of two bases located 

on opposite strands. 

 

In this work, numerical values of the parameters for the PB models are those of Refs. 

[4,5],  that  is,  m=300  amu,  D=0.04  eV,  a=4.45  Å-1,  K=0.04  eV  Å-2,  ρ=0.5  and α=0.35  Å-1, 

while we have assumed  H∆ =0.44 eV, b=0.10 Å-2 and 

bK =10-5 eV Å-2 in Eq. (3) (b has been 

chosen, such that the quadratic term in the expansion of Eq. (3) is very close to PB's one, that

is,  K

). Fig. 1 displays the evolution of 

(

 as a function of

 for these 

numerical  values.  It  is  seen  that  the  finiteness  of  the  stacking  interaction  leads  to  a  well-

marked plateau, in spite of the additional quadratic term. 

The melting curve for the model of Eq. (3) is compared in Fig. 2 to the curves for the 

harmonic and anharmonic PB models. The scattered symbols show the temperature evolution 

 

4 

of  the  average  bond  length  y   obtained  with  the  transfer-integral  (TI)  method  in  the 

thermodynamic  limit  of  infinitely  long  chains  (see  Appendix  A  for  calculation  detail).  It  is 

seen that the melting of the proposed model is as sharp as the melting of the anharmonic PB 

model. Since there is some debate on the applicability of the TI method to models with bound 

on-site potentials [11], molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also performed to check 

the results of TI calculations (see Appendix A for calculation detail). The melting curve for 

the  proposed  model  obtained  from  MD  simulations  applied  to  a  2399  bp  sequence  with 

periodic boundary conditions is displayed in Fig. 2 as a solid line. It fully confirms the results 

obtained  with  the  TI  method.  The  model  of  Eq.  (3)  therefore  shows  that  the  finiteness  of 

stacking interactions may be responsible for the sharpness of melting curves. 

 

Most importantly, the value 

H∆

=0.22 eV is of the same order of magnitude as the 

1
2

stacking,  or  "propagation",  enthalpies,  which  are  routinely  used  in  thermodynamics 

calculations.  For  example,  Table  1  of  Ref.  [10]  shows  that  the  amount  of  energy,  which  is 

released upon extending an existing helix by one additional base pair, varies between 0.347 

eV  and  0.465  eV,  depending  on  the  involved  nucleotides  (note  that  these  quantities  are  for 

two  base  pairs).  This  indicates  that  the  model  of  Eq.  (3)  is  quite  sensible  and  can 

straightforwardly be extended to describe inhomogeneous DNA, according to

  [4].  The  ten 

)(nH∆

  values,  which  are 

necessary to model a particular DNA sequence, are borrowed from Table 1 of Ref. [10], while 

the  other  parameters  are  taken  to  be  m=300  amu,  D=0.05  eV,  a=3.5  Å-1,  b=0.05  Å-2  and 

bK =10-5  eV  Å-2.  Fig.  3  shows  the  results  of  MD  simulations  performed  for  three  different 

2399  bp  DNA  sequences  with  open  ends,  namely,  a  ATATAT...  sequence,  a  GCGCGC... 

sequence, and an inhomogeneous sequence found in the litterature [13]. This figure displays 

the temperature evolution of the probability for the distance 

 to be larger than 15 Å (a 

u −
n

v

n

threshold  value  of  7  Å  leads  to  very  similar  plots).  It  is  seen  that  the  model  of  Eq.  (4) 

successfully reproduces three principal properties of experimental denaturation curves, that is, 

(i)  narrow  transition  temperature  ranges,  (ii)  a  gap  slightly  larger  than  40  K  between  the 

melting temperatures of pure AT sequences and pure GC ones, and (iii) melting temperatures 

proportional to the GC percentage. Indeed, the sequence found in the litterature contains 61% 

of GC bonds, which correlates well with the position of its melting curve. 

 

Moreover,  the  model  of  Eq.  (4)  also  reproduces  the  multi-step  process,  which  is 

experimentally observed for DNA sequences of length ≈1000-10000 bp. This is most easily 

checked in Fig. 4. The top plot of this figure displays, for increasing temperatures, the average 

value 

ny

 as a function of the site number n for a 1793 bp inhomogeneous sequence found 

in the litterature (NCBI entry code NM_001101). The profile at each temperature is averaged 

over hundred 10 ns MD simulations. The bottom plot of Fig. 4 shows, as a function of n, the 

AT  percentage  averaged  over  40  consecutive  base  pairs  of  the  same  sequence.  This 

percentage globally increases from n=1 to n=1793, with a minimum around n=150 and three 

local  maxima  around  n=1300,  n=1450  and  n=1600.  Examination  of  the  top  plot  shows  that 

 

6 

melting correspondingly starts in narrow regions centred around these three later values, while 

the  sequence  abruptly  melts  for  all  n≥1100  at  slightly  higher  temperatures.  There  is  then  a 

plateau of about 4 K before the lower end of the sequence abruptly melts around 330 K. Not 

surprisingly,  the  portion  of  the  sequence  which  melts  at  the  highest  temperature  is  located 

around  the  AT  percentage  minimum  at  n=150.  These  melting  domains  are  in  excellent 

agreement  with  those  obtained  from  statistical  mechanics  calculations  (see  Fig.  2  of  Ref. 

[14]). 

 

Figs. 3 and 4 unambiguously show that, within the model of Eq. (4), the variation of 

stacking  energies  is  sufficient  to  explain  the  variation  of  melting  temperatures  for  different 

DNA sequences, while preceding studies based on the PB models relied instead on different 

parameters for the hydrogen bond Morse potentials and neglected the differences in stacking 

energies  [11,15].  Unfortunately,  the  Morse  potential  parameters  appear  to  be  more  poorly 

determined  than  the  stacking  energies  -  in  part  because  one  Morse  potential  is  expected  to 

model the two or three different hydrogen bonds which connect two bases -, so that they vary 

widely from one study to the other [11,15]. Nonetheless, it will certainly be interesting to take 

the difference in Morse potentials into account in Eq. (4) when the values of the parameters 

are more firmly established. 

 

Let  us  now  turn  back  to  the  model  of  Eq.  (3)  and  its  implications  concerning  the 

dynamics of DNA melting. Fig. 5  shows the temperature evolution of the entropy per site s 

and the specific heat  Vc  of homogeneous DNA according to the PB models and the model of 

Eq.  (3),  as  obtained  from  the  TI  method.  The  first-order  phase  transition  of  the  anharmonic 

PB  model  is  revealed  by  the  divergence  of  Vc   and  the  discontinuity  of  s  at  the  melting 

temperature. Although the curves look slightly different, the model of Eq. (3) displays similar 

features, as can be checked in Fig. 5. The larger the range of y values used in TI calculations, 

the narrower the switching temperature interval in the plot of s and the higher the peak in the 

 

7 

plot  of  Vc   (we  checked  that  the  maximum  of  Vc   increases  linearly  with  the  maximum  y 

value).  Although  more  involved  calculations  would  be  necessary  to  ascertain  this  point  [6], 

this  strongly  suggests  that  the  melting  of  DNA  is  also  associated  with  a  first-order  phase 

transition  for  the  model  of  Eq.  (3).  MD  simulations  were  again  performed  to  check  the  TI 

results. Indeed,  Vc  can be estimated from MD computations as the derivative of the average 

internal  energy  of  the  sequence  with  respect  to  temperature,  that  is,  in 

Bk   units,

 for a sequence of length N. The solid line in Fig. 6 shows the temperature 

evolution  of  the  specific  heat  obtained  from  MD  simulations,  while  the  circles  show  the 

results  of  TI  calculations.  Despite  the  poorer  temperature  resolution  of  MD  simulations 

compared to TI calculations, the two curves are in good agreement. 

 

At that point, it should be realized that, although the expressions for 

(
yW

n y
,

+n

)1

 are 

different, the physical reason why the PB model and that of Eq. (3) lead to a first order phase 

transition is the same for both models. It results indeed from a strong entropic effect due to 

the significant softening of the DNA chain at large displacements. Whether this softening is 

due,  in  real  systems,  to  a  weaker  stiffness  of  single  stranded  DNA  compared  to  double 

stranded DNA, as in the anharmonic PB model, to the finiteness of stacking interactions, as in 

the models of Eqs. (3) and (4), or to a combination of these two possibilities, remains an open 

question. 

 

MD  calculations  were  also  used  to  investigate  the  influence  of  the  length  of  the 

sequence on the melting dynamics (TI calculations are of no help for this purpose because this 

requires  the  knowledge  of  an  unattainable  number  of  eigenvalues  of  the  TI  operator).  The 

temperature evolution of  Vc  for a 100 bp sequence with open ends is shown as a dashed line 

in Fig. 6. This curve is essentially displaced by about 20 K to lower temperature compared to 

the  2399  bp  sequence.  Although  the  magnitude  of  the  shift  is  too  large,  this  displacement 

 

8 

qualitatively  agrees  with  experiment.  The  most  important  point,  however,  is  that  Fig.  6 

suggests  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the  denaturation  dynamics  of 

relatively short and rather long sequences. 

 

To  summarize,  we  have  shown  that  the  finiteness  of  stacking  interactions  may  be 

responsible for the sharpness of DNA denaturation curves. The proposed microscopic model, 

which explicitly uses the stacking enthalpies of thermodynamical calculations, leads to good 

agreement with known experimental results for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous DNA, 

and suggests, like the anharmonic PB model, that DNA melting is associated with a first-order 

phase transition. In future work, it will be interesting to investigate whether this kind of model 

can be adapted to describe thinner details of the rich DNA dynamics.

averaged over 0.5 K temperature intervals, that is, 10 ns time intervals.

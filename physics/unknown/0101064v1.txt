Late-time cosmic acceleration: the big bang and the big bag

Ding-Yu Chung

Quintessence,  a  scalar  field  with  negative  pressure,  dominates  the  universe  to

cause  cosmic  acceleration  only  recently.      In  this  paper,  this  late-time  cosmic

acceleration is explained by the dual universe (the big bang and the big bag) and

the  periodic  table  of  elementary  particles  derived  from  the  eleven  dimensional

Planck  supermembrane  with  the  Planck  mass.    The  supersymmetry  of  the

Planck supermembrane is broken into a Kaluza-Klein structure where the lower

dimensional spacetime has lower energy than the higher dimensional spacetime.

The big bang universe starts from the Planck supermembrane with independent

permanent  particles  in  the  decay  mode,  and  decays  immediately  into  the  four

dimensional  universe. 

  The  big  bag  universe  starts 

from 

the  Planck

supermembranes with concerted particles in the decay mode, and undergoes a

gigantic  slow  cosmic  quantum  oscillation  between  the  high-energy  eleven

dimensional spacetime and the low-energy two dimensional spacetime.  Both the

big bang and big bag start at the same time.  When the energy level of the decay

mode  in  the  big  bag  is  equal  to  the  energy  level  between  the  five-dimensional

and 

the 

four-dimensional  spacetime, 

the  dormant  big  bag  switches 

to

quintessence  with  a  ubiquitous  negative  pressure  causing 

the  cosmic

acceleration  in  the  big  bang  universe.    The  calculation  shows  that  the  peak

cosmic acceleration occurs recently in about 8 billion years after the big bang.

Introduction

Recent  observations  of  large-scale  structure  suggest  that  the  universe  is

undergoing cosmic acceleration and is dominated by a dark energy with negative

pressure [1].  The dark energy can be provided by a non-vanishing cosmological

constant or quintessence [2], a scalar field with negative pressure.  However, a

cosmological constant requires extremely fine-tuned [3].  Quintessence requires

an  explanation  for  the  late-  time  cosmic  acceleration 

[4]. 

  Why  does

quintessence dominate the universe only recently?   One of the explanations is

the k-essence model where the pressure of quintessence switched to a negative

value at the onset of matter-domination in the universe [4].

In  this  paper,  late-time  cosmic  acceleration  is  explained  by  the  dual

universe  and  the  periodic  table  of  elementary  particles  [5]  derived  from  the

eleven  dimensional  Planck  supermembrane  with 

the  Planck  mass.  The

supersymmetry  of  the  Planck  supermembrane  is  broken  into  a  Kaluza-Klein

structure  where  the  lower  dimensional  spacetime  has  lower  energy  than  the

higher dimensional spacetime.

The  dual  universe  consists  of  the  big  bang  universe  and  the  big  bag

universe. 

  The  big  bang  universe  starts 

from 

the  big  bang  Planck

supermembrane  with  independent  permanent  particles  in  the  decay  mode,  and

decays  immediately  into  the  four  dimensional  universe  containing  the  observed

elementary  particles.    The  big  bag  universe  starts  from  the  big  bag  Planck

supermembranes with concerted particles in the decay mode, and undergoes a

2

gigantic slow cosmic quantum  oscillation  between  the  high-energy  small  eleven

dimensional  spacetime  and  the  low-energy  large  two  dimensional  spacetime.

Both  the  big  bang  and  the  big  bag  start  at  the  same  time.    The  big  bag  is  the

precursor of quintessence.

The  generation  of  elementary  particles  from  the  big  bang  Planck

supermembrane  with  independent  permanent  particles  in  the  decay  mode  was

discussed  in  details  in  Reference  5,  and  will  be  briefly  reviewed  in  Sections  2

and  3. 

  The 

transformation 

the  big  bag  Planck  supermembrane 

into

quintessence will be discussed in Section 4.

The Transformation Of The Big Bang Planck Supermembrane

A supermembrane can be described as two dimensional object that moves

in an eleven dimensional space-time [6].  This supermembrane can be converted

into the ten dimensional superstring with the extra dimension curled into a circle to

become a closed superstring.   Based on this eleven-dimensional

supermembrane, the seven extra space dimension assumes a Kaluza-Klein

substructure for the broken Planck supermembrane.  

  In the Kaluza-Klein

substructure for the seven extra spatial dimensions, the fifth dimensional orbit is a

one-dimensional circle associated with every point in ordinary flat four-dimensional

space-time, the sixth dimensional orbit circles the fifth dimensional orbit, and in the

same way, every higher extra dimensional orbit with higher energy circles the lower

dimensional orbit with lower energy.

3

Each  extra  space-time  dimension  can  be  described  by  a  fermion  and  a

boson.    The  masses  of  fermion  and  its  boson  partner  are  not  the  same.    This

supersymmetry  breaking  is  in  the  form  of  a  energy  hierarchy  with  increasing

energies from the dimension five to the dimension eleven as

 

 F5 B5 F6 B6 F7 B7 F8 B8 F9 B9 F10 B10 F11 B11

where  B  and  F  are  boson  and  fermion  in  each  spacetime  dimension.  The

probability  to  transforming  a  fermion  into  its  boson  partner  in  the  adjacent

dimension  is  same  as  the  fine  structure  constant,  α,  the  probability  of  a  fermion

emitting  or  absorbing  a  boson.    The  probability  to  transforming  a  boson  into  its

fermion partner in the same dimension is also the fine structure constant, α.  This

hierarchy can be expressed in term of the dimension number, D,

E D-1, B  =   E D,F  αD,F    ,

E D, F     =   E D, B  αD, B    ,

(1)

(2)

where ED,B and ED,F  are the energies for a boson and a fermion, respectively, and

αD, B or αD,F is the fine structure constant, which is the ratio between the energies

of a boson and its fermionic partner.  All fermions and bosons are related by the

order  1/α.    (In  some  mechanism  for  the  dynamical  supersymmetry  breaking,  the

effects  of  order  exp  (-4π2/  g2)  where  g  is  some  small  coupling,  give  rise  to  large

mass hierarchies [7].)  Assuming αD,B = αD,F , the relation between the bosons in

the  adjacent  dimensions,  then,  can  be  expressed  in  term  of  the  dimension

number, D,

E D-1, B =  E D, B  α2 D ,

0, and the number of extra

dimensions (seven), the masses of BD as the gauge boson can be calculated as

shown in Table 1.

In Table 1, αw is not same as α of the rest, because there is symmetry

group mixing between B5 and B7 as the symmetry mixing in the standard theory of

the electroweak interaction, and sinθw is not equal to 1.  As shown in Reference 5,

B5, B6, B7, B8, B9, and B10 are A (massless photon), π1/2, ZL

respectively, responsible for the electromagnetic field, the strong interaction, the

weak (left handed) interaction, the CP (right handed) nonconservation, the CP (left

handed) nonconservation, and the P (right handed) nonconservation, respectively.

The calculated value for θw is 29.690 in good agreement with 28.70 for the

observed value of θw [8].   The calculated energy for B11 (the Planck

supermembrane) is 1.1x1019 GeV in good agreement with the Planck mass,

1.2x1019 GeV. The calculated masses of all gauge bosons are also in good

6

agreement with the observed values.  Most importantly, the calculation shows that

exactly seven extra dimensions are needed for all fundamental interactions.

The Transformation Of The Big Bag Planck Supermembrane

At  the  same  time  as  the  big  bang,  the  big  bag  universe  with  concerted

particles  in  the  decay  mode  starts  a  gigantic  slow  cosmic  quantum  oscillation

between  the  high-energy  small  eleven  dimension  spacetime  and  the  low-energy

large two dimensional spacetime.  As in a microscopic quantum system before the

measurement  process,  there  are  no  independent  permanent  components  within

the  big  bag  during  the  cosmic  quantum  oscillation.    The  big  bag  Planck

supermembrane decays gradually.  The average dimension of the particles in the

big  bag  changes  continuously  and  concertedly  with  the  age  of  the  expanding

universe.  All particles are in a concerted change.

On the other hand, in the big bang universe, the immediate decay of the

big  bang  Planck  supermembrane  is  caused  by  the  collapse  of  the  cosmic

10

quantum  oscillation  by  independent  permanent  particles  in  the  decay  mode.    A

number  of  factors  contribute  to  the  generation  of  the  independent  permanent

particles.  The left-handed CP-nonconservation leads to independent permanent

excess  baryons  and  leptons.    The  baryon  number  conservation  leads  to

independent  permanent  baryons  and  leptons.    The  chiral  symmetry  in  the  left-

handed  parity  nonconservation  results  in  independent  permanent  zero  mass

neutrinos.    The  absorption  of  the  scalar  field  in  the  four-dimensional  spacetime

by  the  higher  dimensional  fermions  and  bosons  through  Higgs  mechanism

results  in  the  independent  permanent  zero  vacuum  energy  in  the  four

dimensional  spacetime  and  the  permanent  masses  of  particles.  The  myriad

independent permanent particles contribute to the collapse of the comic quantum

oscillation,  forcing  the  immediate  decay  from  the  eleven  dimensional  Planck

supermembrane  to  the  four  dimensional  big  bang  universe  containing  the

observed elementary particles.

The big bag remains dormant with respect to the big bang universe until

the energy level of the decay mode in the big bag is equal to the energy level

between the five-dimensional spacetime and the four dimensional spacetime as

in the big bang universe.  The periodic table of elementary particles in Table 2

shows that all elementary particles are derived from the five and higher

dimensional spacetime.  The dormant big bag switches to quintessence that has

the compatible dimensional spacetime with the big bang universe.   The

compatible energy level is between the energy levels of the five dimensional

11

fermion and the four dimensional boson.  From Eqs (1) and (2) and Table 1, the

energies of the five dimensional fermion and the four dimensional boson are

calculated to be 2.72 x10-8 GeV and 1.99 x10-10 GeV, respectively.  The energy of

the Planck supermembrane is 1.1x1019 GeV from Table 1.  The energy ratio

between the Planck supermembrane and the five dimensional fermion and the four

dimensional boson are 4.17 x1026 and 5.71 x1028, respectively.   In other words,

there are 4.17 x1026 five dimensional fermions and 5.71 x1028 four dimensional

bosons per Planck supermembrane.  Assume that the decay rate is one particle

per Planck time (ħ / MP c 2 =  5.4 x10-11 second) per parent Planck

supermembrane.   The total time for the decay is 0.7 billion years for the five

dimensional fermion, and 98 billion years for the four dimensional boson.

Therefore, quintessence starts in 0.7 billion years after the Big Bang, and ends in

98 billions years.

The rise and the fall of quintessence are analogous to the passing of the

big bag universe through the big bang universe.  If the percentage of the

overlapping between the big bag universe and the big bang universe is the

function of time in logarithmic term, the complete overlapping occurs recently in

about 8 billion years after the big bang.  At this point, the strength of

quintessence reaches to the peak.  The universe now is 15 billion years old, and

the percentage of the overlapping is about 94 percentage.  The overlapping

versus time is shown in Fig. 2.

Since the individual particle in the big bag cannot function independently,

there is no interaction between the individual big bag particle and the individual

big bang particle. The big bag universe as a whole affects the big bang universe

as a whole.  The big bag universe can affect the big bang universe only as the

ubiquitous negative pressure, forcing the cosmic acceleration in the big bang

universe.   At the start of quintessence, the negative pressure is too weak to

cause cosmic acceleration.  If the increase of the negative pressure is the

function of time in logarithmic term, the greatest acceleration occurs at the peak

of the negative pressure in 8 billion years after the big bang.  The universe now,

15 billion years old, is about 94 percent of the peak acceleration.

The oscillation of the big bag now is in the expansion mode.  When the

oscillation is in the contraction mode in the future, and again passes the four

dimensional spacetime, quintessence will have the positive pressure to cancel

the negative pressure during the expansion mode, and cause the contraction of

13

the big bang universe.  Therefore, the big bang universe and the big bag

universe can contract together.

Toward the end of the contraction mode, both big bang universe and the

big bag universe are near the eleven dimensional Planck supermembrane.  At

this point, the big bag universe and the big bang universe again have compatible

spacetime.  The dormant big bag again switches to quintessence as the positive

pressure to contract the big bang universe.  Finally, both universes reach the

eleven dimensional spacetime.  At start of the expansion mode for the big bag

universe, quintessence switches to the negative pressure for the inflation phase

of the big bang in quintessential inflation model [11].  This quintessence inflates

the space of the big bang universe.  The inflation of space stretches the Planck

supermembranes that decay in a short time into the independent permanent

elementary particles and radiation.  As soon as the decay takes place, the big

bag universe is again dormant with respect to the big bang universe until the next

time they meet again in late-time cosmic acceleration.

5.

Conclusion

In  this  paper,  late-time  cosmic  acceleration  is  explained  by  the  dual

universe  and  the  periodic  table  of  elementary  particles  derived  from  the  eleven

dimensional Planck supermembrane with the Planck mass.  The supersymmetry

of the Planck supermembrane is broken into a Kaluza-Klein structure where the

14

lower  dimensional  spacetime  has  lower  energy  than  the  higher  dimensional

spacetime.

The  dual  universe  consists  of  the  big  bag  universe  and  the  big  bang

universe.  The  big  bag  universe  starts  from  the  Planck  supermembranes  with

concerted  particles  in  the  decay  mode,  and  undergoes  a  gigantic  slow  cosmic

quantum  oscillation  between 

the  high-energy  small  eleven  dimensional

spacetime  and  the  low-energy  large  two  dimensional  spacetime.  As  in  a

microscopic  quantum  system  before  the  measurement  process,  there  are  no

independent  permanent  components  with  the  big  bag  during  this  cosmic

quantum  oscillation. 

  The  big  bang  universe  starts 

from 

the  Planck

supermembrane with independent permanent particles in the decay mode.  Due

to  the  independent  permanent  particles  in  the  decay  mode  in  the  big  bang

universe,  the  cosmic  quantum  oscillation  collapses,  and  the  big  bang  Planck

supermembrane  decays  immediately  to  the  four  dimensional  big  bang  universe

containing the observed elementary particles.

Both the big bang and the big bag start at the same time.  When the

energy level of the decay mode in the big bag is equal to the energy level

between the five-dimensional spacetime and the four-dimensional spacetime,

the dormant big bag switches to quintessence with a ubiquitous negative

pressure that causes the cosmic acceleration in the big bang universe.

According to the calculation, the period of quintessence is between 0.7 billion

years and 98 billion years after the big bang, and the peak strength of

15

quintessence occurs recently in about 8 billion years.  The universe now, 15

billion years old, is about 94 percent of the peak acceleration.

The reason for the existence of the dual universe is to prevent the big bang

universe from being infinitely small (cosmic singularity) and infinitely large (infinite

cosmic  expansion).  The  mechanism  is  the  quantum  tunneling  of  space  between

the  big  bang  universe  and  the  big  bag  universe,  when  both  universes  have

compatible  spacetime.    The  negative  pressure  of  quintessence  in  the  big  bang

universe is simply the space emitted by the big bag universe and absorbed by the

big  bang  universe,  so  there  is  accelerated  expansion,  occurring  during  the  big

bang  and  during  the  recent  late-time  cosmic  acceleration.  When  the  space

becomes  infinitely  small  just  before  the  big  bang,  the  big  bag  universe  tunnels

some space to the big bang universe to start the big bang.  On the other hand, the

positive  pressure  of  quintessence  in  the  big  bang  universe  is  simply  the  space

emitted by the big bang universe and absorbed by the big bag universe, so there is

accelerated contraction, occurring during the end of the cosmic contraction and the

late-time  contraction.    When  the  big  bang  universe  has  infinite  expansion  as  the

trend of the current cosmic expansion, the big bang universe tunnels some space

to the big bag universe to start the contraction. All physical laws are guaranteed to

be ultimately reversible without infinity.

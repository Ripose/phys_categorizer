Introduction 

 
Let  me  begin  with  my  sincere  thanks  for  the  opportunity  to  deliver  this 
Memorial Lecture for George Marx, for we were very close friends during many 
decades  of  our  lives.  When  I  shall  talk  about  Neutrino  Physics,  I  will  select 
those  topics  from  the  vast  field  in  which  we  both  shared  deepest  interest  and 
about which we had personal discussions. 
It  was  George  who  some  time  ago  drew  my  attention  to  a  nice  cartoon  in  an 
English text book of Electrodynamics:

- and there was light! 

 
 
However, this is a very reductionist view, for light stems from the sun, at least 
between heaven and earth; but with Maxwell’s equations alone the sun cannot 
shine! Therefore we have to add the following:

And Wolfgang Pauli said: 
 
Let there be Neutrinos! 
 
And Enrico Fermi said: 
 
Let them interact weakly! 
 
And the sun began to shine! 
 

 
 
In fact, when Wolfgang Pauli predicted the Neutrino in 1930, he did not dare to 
publish it for he feared it might never be detected experimentally. He proposed it 
in  a  letter  to  a  conference  on  radio-activity  in  Tübingen.  And  he  said  to  his 
friend  Walter  Baade:  “Today  I  have  done  something  which  no  theoretical 
physicist  should  ever  do  in  his  life:  I  have  predicted  something  which  shall 
never be detected experimentally!”1
Walter  Baade  –  an  astronomer  –  apparently  had  great  respect  for 
experimentalists and so he bet Pauli that it will one day be detected. And when 
Reines  and  Cowan  announced  the  discovery of  the  neutrino  in  1956,  Pauli  did 
pay his bet (a case of Champagne)! I wanted to know whether this story is true 
and at the Neutrino meeting in Aachen I asked Fred Reines (a very close friend 
of  both  George  and  mine)  about  it.  He  got very  furious  and  said  that  yes,  it  is 
true, but the Champagne was drank by the theoreticians alone and he and Cowan 
did not get any drop of it. 
But let me not jump forward too fast! 
Before  the  great  success  of  Reines  and  Cowan  it  was  not  very  clear,  what  the 
best  source  for  neutrinos  could  be.  In  a  paper2  by  F.G.  Houtermans  and  W. 
Thirring  the  authors  suggest  the  sun  as  source.  They  estimate  the  flux  of 
neutrinos  from  the  sun  to  be  6×1010  Neutrinos/cm²sec.  But  in  a  note  added  in 
proof  they  say:  “For  technical  reasons  the  publication  of  this  paper  has  been 
delayed. Meanwhile it seems that evidence for absorption processes of neutrinos 
by inverse ß-decay has been obtained by F.Reines and C.L.Cowan.”3
They refer to the first paper of Reines and Cowan which was criticised for small 
statistics. The definite acceptance came only after the paper of 1956.4

1995: F. Reines “for the detection of the neutrino.” 
2002: R. Davis Jr. and M. Koshiba “for pioneering contributions to astrophysics,  

in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos.” 

 
Let us now go through the historical list and see why each of these steps was so 
fundamental at the time. 
 
 
 
Around  1960  the  community  of  particle  physicists  was  faced  with  a  profound 
problem. The weak decay of the muon was well understood,

(The value in Eq.2 is todays best value!5) Any charged particle-antiparticle pair 
can  be  transformed  into  a  photon.  Since  the  neutrino  has  neither  charge  nor 
magnetic  moment,  it  is  not  possible  in  this  case.  However,  if  the  weak 
interactions are mediated by a charged intermediate boson W , there can be inner 
bremsstrahlung  and  the  decay  (2)  must  be  possible,  unless  it  is  forbidden  by 
another  selection  rule,  i.e.  separate  conservation  of  muon  and  electron  lepton 
number.  In  that  case,  νe  and  νμ  are  different.  Thus  there  was  an  alternative: 
Either there exists no intermediate boson W, or νe and νμ are different! 
It  was  obviously  a  crucial  question  to  know  whether  all  interactions  are  of 
Yukawa  type  or  there  is  an  exception,  weak  interactions  of  Four-Fermi  type! 
Thus one had to know whether there are 2 types of neutrinos or not. 
It was mainly Gilberto Bernardini who pushed with all his personal strength for 
a neutrino experiment at CERN. To get a feeling for its difficulty, let us recall 
some basics about neutrino reactions. The total cross-section of a neutrino with 
energy Eν scattering from a target T is

Const. ≅ 10-38 cm²/GeV².

So for a neutrino in the GeV energy range, scattering from a nucleon, the cross-
section  is  about  10-38cm²  whereas  it  is  10-41cm²  if  the  neutrino  is  in  the  MeV 
energy range. (This was the cross section Reines and Cowan had to face in their 
experiment.) 
It would have been a great chance for the young CERN to settle the question of 
the  neutrinos,  but  CERN  aimed  at  a  precision  experiment  with  roughly  1000 
events. However, the most crucial point could be answered with just a handful 
of events; neutrino beams from pions are predominantly νμ if there are 2 types of 
neutrinos.  Thus  their  “inverse  ß-decay”  should  produce  exclusively  muons. 
Indeed,  the  experiment  was  done  at  the  then  newborn  Brookhaven  accelerator 
and proved the existence of 2 types of neutrinos.6

 

Solar Neutrinos. 

 
 
It is now more than 40 years since John Bahcall did the first detailed calculation 
of the flux of neutrinos from the sun. The basic process of Hydrogen burning in 
the sun is 
 

4p → α + 2e+ + 2νe + 26.731 MeV. 

 

(5) 

 

 
But the detailed reactions are far more complicated as they involve also – among 
others – He3, Be7, Li7 and B8. The most energetic neutrinos stem from B8 
(average energy 7.4 MeV). There is a sharp line from Be7 at Eν=0.862 MeV. 
Both these neutrinos could be detected by the inverse ß-reaction 
 

νe + Cl37 → Ar37 + e- 
 

 

(6) 

It was Ray Davis who dared to do this experiment. He put a huge tank with 
100.000 gallons (~ 400.000 liters) cleaning fluid (C2Cl4) deep underground in 
the Homestake mine and washed single atoms of Argon out into a counter.7 Of 
course, the expected rate was exceedingly small! The unit used in solar neutrino 
experiments is called “Solar Neutrino Unit” or SNU. It is defined by 
 

1 SNU = 10-36 captures/atom.sec 

 

(7) 

 
By 1984, Davis had accumulated enough events to give a solar neutrino flux of 
2.1±0.3 SNU.8 But the prediction of Bahcall was much higher9, 6-8 SNU 
depending on the parameters of the solar model. Obviously, this caused a great

stir in the community! I remember well the discussion following Davis’ talk at 
one of the Balaton meetings organised by George Marx. The consensus then was 
that one of the following assertions had to be true: 
 

1.  The experiment is wrong 
2.  The solar model is wrong 
3.  Nuclear physics is wrong 
4.  Particle physics is wrong 

 
At that time, nobody expected the last statement to be the correct one! The 
situation was so critical that Hans Bethe in his talk at George Marx’s Neutrino 
Symposium 1988 in Boston remarked that he becomes uncertain whether he 
obtained the Nobel prize for the right reason! 
Thus one had to reproduce the experiment with a better threshold. The reaction 
 

 

 

(8) 

νe + Ga71 → Ge71 + e- 
 
has a threshold low enough to observe neutrinos from the primary reaction (5). 
Two Gallium experiments were set up, “Gallex” at Gran Sasso and “SAGE” 
(Soviet-American-Gallium-Experiment10) at the Caucasus. But they also showed 
a deficit of solar neutrino flux as compared to the solar model prediction which 
became more and more accurate as time went on. 
Finally, the large Cerenkov-Detector “Super-Kamiokande” in Japan came into 
operation. By means of the elastic reaction 
 

νe + e- → νe + e- 

 

 

(9) 

 

it was not only able to observe solar neutrinos, it could also determine the 
direction of incidence of the neutrinos because the reaction (9) is strongly 
forward peaked. Hans Bethe was surely relieved by the result, indeed there were 
neutrinos from the sun, albeit too few! (I remember vividly how excited George 
Marx was when he showed me the first graph with neutrino reactions definitely 
pointing in the direction of the sun!) 
At the time of the Neutrino Symposium 2002 in Munich (the last one which 
George attended!) the ratio of observed neutrino flux to the solar model 
prediction was:

Neutrino-Oscillations

Before we go to the solution of the solar neutrino puzzle we have to go back to 
Bruno Pontecorvo’s idea of neutrino mixing. 
 
 
 
As early as 1957, Bruno Pontecorvo (a very close friend to George Marx) 
suggested that neutrinos could oscillate11 (in analogy to the neutral Kaon 
system). Mixing of neutrino flavours was suggested by Maki et al.12 This 
presupposes that neutrinos of different species have different mass, thus not all 
of them can be massless. Since the “Standard Model” assumed massless 
neutrinos13, this was a courageous step into new physics!   
If two species of neutrinos are mixed, we have “mass eigenstates” (ν1, ν2, say) 
differing from “weak eigenstates” (νe, νμ). The transition probability of νl  → νl’
(l,l’=e,μ) is given by

Experimentally, one can either look for appearance of a neutrino species at a 
distance L which was not originally present in the beam of energy E 
(“appearance experiment”); alternatively, one can measure the thinning of a 
beam due to oscillation of some of the neutrinos into the other species 
(“disappearance experiment”).

As stated above, neutrino oscillation requires a mass difference, hence at least 
one non-vanishing neutrino mass. Direct mass limits are difficult to obtain with 
great precision. The best limit stems from tritium decay

where ξ is the nuclear matrix element and E0 the maximal electron energy Ee. 
Clearly, the intensity of the spectrum is there minimal so one is in need of very 
many events.  
In the course of many experiments some strange phenomena showed up. 
(George was always most interested in the unexpected!) Until very recently, all 
experiments gave a negative mν² while statistically this should only happen in 
about half the cases! There was also some strange half-year variation in the 
experiment, called the “Troitsk-effect” which was occasionally interpreted as a 
huge disk of relic neutrinos through which the earth was travelling twice a year 
on its orbit. Fortunately all these phenomena have disappeared and the best 
result on the electron-neutrino mass stems from the two experiments in Mainz 
and Troitsk; both give a limit of 2.2 eV. 
In view of the importance of the neutrino mass, a new experiment – KATRIN – 
is planned in Karlsruhe. It aims at a sub-eV sensitivity and should reach 0.2 eV 
by 2013. 
 
 
 
Much to the surprise of the particle physicists community, a third generation of 
leptons was discovered by Martin Perl14 and his collaborators in 1975. 
Obviously, it was the charged lepton τ which was first seen through the reaction 
 

The Third Generation

e+e- → μ± + e-/+ + missing energy 

 

(16) 

 
The question arose, whether the corresponding neutrino was also of the new 3rd 
generation or rather one of the known two species. However, these possibilities 
could soon be ruled out by experiment. It took quite some time, until the third 
generation neutrino was actually “seen” through its reaction producing a τ-
lepton. (In the DONUT-experiment).

The Supernova 1987

(In October 1977, a Triangle-Symposium on Hadron Spectroscopy was 
organized in Strbske Pleso. George and I were amused by the fact that I gave a 
talk on “The fifth Lepton” and he on “The sixth Lepton”.) 
 
 
 
In February 1987 a Supernova exploded nearby in the Large Magellanic Cloud. 
For the first time in history, also the neutrino burst from such an event was 
recorded.15 Although one could obtain an upper limit16 on the mass of  νe, much 
more information could have been extracted, had the clocks of the two main 
detectors in Japan and USA been properly synchronized. Unfortunately that was 
not the case. (I remember my workshop on weak interactions and neutrinos in 
Santa Fé 1987, where the representative of Kamiokande regretted this with the 
words “it is very embarrassing since my country is known to export good 
watches.”) They had let a graduate student set the clock of the detector 
according to his own wrist watch since nobody expected the precise time to be 
of any relevance! 
The big underground detectors were originally developed to discover the decay 
of the proton. Thus “Kamiokande” was short for “Kamioka Nucleon Decay 
Experiment”. When the proton life-time was pushed beyond the capabilities of 
the detectors and after the historic observation of the Supernova, Kamiokande 
was renamed to mean “Kamioka Neutrino Detection Equipment”. 
 
 
 
When a cosmic ray particle hits the atmosphere, mainly pions are produced. 
They decay via π → μ + νμ and the muon decays via Eq.(1). From this very 
simple argument it is clear, that in the cosmic rays twice as many νμ than νe 
should be present.18 Of course there are corrections and there is background (e.g. 
from produced kaons etc.). However, these corrections can be applied and still 
the ratio was persistently too low.  
A beautiful experiment at Super-Kamiokande measured the ratio of upcoming 
versus downgoing muons stemming from neutrino interactions. Whilst the 
downgoing neutrinos had only about 10 km to travel, upcoming had to traverse 
the whole earth and thus had about 10.000 km to arrive at the detector. Thus 
they had enough time to oscillate according to eq.(10). Detailed analysis showed 
that νμ’s oscillated mainly into ντ’s with maximal mixing angle sin²2θ = 1 and a 
mass difference of Δm² = 2.5x10-3 eV² (see eq.13). 

Atmospheric Neutrinos17

16 D. Schramm: Proc.Int.Symp.Lepton Photon Hamburg (1987)471. 
17 Atmospheric neutrinos were first observed in India and South Africa:  

C.V. Achar et al.: Phys.Lett. 18(1965)196; F. Reines et.al.: Phys.Rev.Letters 15(1965)429 

18 Because of time-dilatation this argument is only correct at lower ν-energies.

Once neutrino oscillations were experimentally suggested, the idea to solve the 
solar neutrino puzzle by disappearance oscillations of νe became a sound 
possibility. However, it had to be tested in a positive way also. As long as one 
could only observe charged current events, disappearance was the only choice. 
Thus one had to set up a new type of detector which could also observe neutral 
current neutrino reactions. 
 
 
 
In order to also detect neutral current neutrino reactions, a huge Cerenkov 
detector filled with 1.000 tons of pure heavy water was built in the Sudbury 
mine in northern Canada. Deuterium allows for the following neutrino reactions: 
 

The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO)

 

 

νl + d → νl + n + p    l=e,µ,τ 

 

(17a) 

νe + d → e- + p + p 

 

           (17b) 

 
Thus one could observe via eq.(17a) also the total, undiminished neutrino flux 
from the sun. 
It was a great relief and a beautiful success when the results showed indeed that 
the total neutrino flux from the sun (Neutrino Symp. Munich 2002) 
 

φSNO = 5.09 +0.44+0.46/-0.43-0.43 

 

(18a) 

was in perfect agreement with the theoretical expectation from the Standard 
Solar Model (SSM) 
 

φSSM = 5.05 +1.01/-0.81   

(18b) 

 
But in order to extract oscillation data similar to the atmospheric case, this was 
not sufficient. There was still an ambiguity. It had to be resolved by yet another 
beautiful experiment: KamLAND. It is a 1.000 ton liquid scintillator neutrino 
detector in Kamioka, Japan, collecting neutrino events from all the surrounding 
nuclear power plants! 
Together, the two experiments gave the best fit for oscillations of solar 
neutrinos: 
 

Δm² = 8.3x10-5 eV² 

sin²2θ = 0.83                          (19) 

 
With three generations of neutrinos and two kinds of oscillations (i.e. two mass 
differences) this would give a nice picture even if we only know mass 

 

10

Sterile Neutrinos?

differences and not their absolute values. But there is – and we look into the 
future now – a puzzle still to be resolved. 
 
 
 
An oscillation experiment has been performed in Los Alamos, the LSND 
experiment. When a π+ is produced, it decays via π+ → μ+ + νμ  and the positive 
. Thus in a purely positive pion beam there 
muon decays via 

+
μ
eν . If they do, they have to stem from appearance 

cannot appear any 
oscillations, provided background is carefully subtracted. 
The LSND experiment observed just these 
that their measured mass difference is far too large to fit into a three neutrino 
scheme. But we know that there cannot be a straightforward fourth generation. 
Already in 1976 I have pointed out19 that we can extract the number of different 
neutrino species NG from the width of the Z-boson by means of 
 

eν ‘s! It is a 4σ result! The trouble is 

+
μνν

+→ +
e

e

ΓZ = Γ(Z→visible) + NG×Γ(Z→νν). 

 

(20) 

 
The value given by the Particle Data Group in 2004 (ref.5) is 
 

NG = 2.994±0.012  

 

 

(21) 

 
Thus a fourth neutrino cannot be of the same nature as the other three for it does 
not couple to the Z-Boson. It is generally called “sterile neutrino” and to me a 
very ugly creature! Since the LSND result has not yet been independently 
reproduced, it remains open whether it is correct. In the last years, it was 
standard practice that the summary of the International Neutrino Conference – 
Georges child! – was opened with the dry remark “in my summary, I ignore the 
LSND result!”. Still, the question has to be objectively answered! Thus an 
experiment – MiniBooNE – is under way to check on the LSND result. First 
results were promised for 2005 but there are some delays because it has to be 
done very carefully since it is a very important question.  
The neutrino physicist community is eagerly waiting for the clarification of this 
question! 
The International Neutrino Conference in Munich (2002) was the last of this 
series which George was able to attend, to open and to conclude. Two years 
later, in Paris, I had the honour to remember him20 at the opening. The series 
shall go on with undiminished spirit, but we shall miss its father – George Marx 
– very sincerely.

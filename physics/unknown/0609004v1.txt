A  simulation  methodology  for  predicting  the  time-course  of  enzymatic  digestions  is 

described. The model is based solely on the enzyme’s sub-site architecture and concomitant 

binding energies. This allows sub-site binding energies to be used to predict the evolution of 

the  relative  amounts  of  different  products  during  the  digestion  of  arbitrary  mixtures  of 

oligomeric or polymeric substrates. The methodology has been specifically demonstrated by 

studying  the  fragmentation  of  a  population  of  oligogalacturonides  of  varying  degrees  of 

polymerization,  when  digested  by  endo-polygalacturonse  II  (endo-PG  II)  from  Aspergillus

1. Introduction 

The  importance  of  degradative  enzymes  across  the  whole  of  Nature  can  hardly  be  over-

emphasised. All biopolymers are, at some point, disassembled during recycling or digestion. 

Additionally, the routine remodelling of biopolymer fine structures in order to maximise their 

in-vivo  functionality  often  involves  carrying  out  modifications  to  their  degree  of 

polymerisation (DP). Furthermore, coupling a thorough knowledge of the action of degrading

enzymes  with  the  measurement  of  the  structures  of  released  fragments  has  the  potential  to 

yield information on the fine structure of pre-digested substrates. Such an approach still holds 

particular promise for polysaccharide systems, where the molecular biology tools that have so 

advanced nucleotide and protein sequencing are simply not available. Hence, polysaccharide 

degrading enzymes are not only of fundamental  biochemical  interest but  also, owing to the 

substrate  sequence  sensitivity  of  their  enzyme-substrate  interactions,  offer  the  hope  of 

developing a tangible link between the structures of released digest fragments and polymeric 

fine structure [1-9]. 

Models  of  polysaccharide-enzyme  interactions  routinely  begin  with  the  protein  being 

described by a series of sub-sites, each capable of binding a sugar residue [10]. These sub-

sites  consist  of  groups  of  amino-acids,  with  their  chemical  nature  giving  rise  to  differential 

affinities  between  such  sites  and  the  substrate.  Sub-sites  labelled  +1  and  -1  indicate  the 

position of the active site, while surrounding sub-sites, extending from the active site to the 

proximities  of  the  binding  cleft,  play  a  role  in  binding  the  substrate  [11].  By  observing  the 

preferred  cutting  position  of  substrates  that  are  smaller  than  the  number  of  sub-sites  in  the 

enzyme binding site, relative affinities and hence binding energies of different sub-sites can 

be  obtained  [12-17].  Such  maps  can  be  used  to  give  support  to  molecular  models  of  the 

enzyme-substrate  interaction  by  providing  experimental  values  that  can  be  compared  with 

chemical  intuition  based  on  the  nature  of  the  moieties  within  the  amino  acids  of  each 

designated sub-site. Once the relative importance of hydrophobic and charge interactions is 

inferred the effects of solution properties might also be rationalised.  Such  experiments  also 

provide  data  that  can  be  compared  with  attempts  to  directly  model  the  enzyme-substrate 

interaction [18]. However, despite the many positive aspects of sub-site mapping procedures 

 

 

2

such results have not, as far as we are aware, been used to predict the general time-course of 

the enzyme digestion of arbitrary mixtures of oligomeric or polymeric substrates.  

The study of the enzymatic digestion of biopolymer substrates has also been a fertile area of 

research  in  its  own  right.  In  particular,  experimental  techniques  for  obtaining  data  on 

biopolymer  digest  fragments  and  studying  the  structure  of  complexes  continue  to  

improve  [19-23].  Modelling  approaches  meanwhile  have  focussed  largely  on  solving 

differential equations, [24] developing recursion schemes [25] and using methods that assume 

statistical models of chain structure and a strict set of prescribed enzymatic rules [8]. In this 

work  we  show  that  a  simulation  of  substrate  digestion,  derived  simply  from  the  enzyme’s 

sub-site  architecture  and  attendant  binding  energies,  can  successfully  describe  the 

experimental  time-course  of  digestion  of  distributions  of  substrate  molecules  of  varying 

lengths. We demonstrate this specifically by taking a well defined starting mixture consisting 

of  substrates  of  various  DPs,  measuring  the  evolution  of  the  concentration  of  all  species 

during  enzymatic  processing,  and  comparing  the  results  with  a  simulation.  Further,  we 

examine the sensitivity of the form of the predicted digest pattern to variations in the binding 

energies associated with the different sub-sites. 

Oligogalacturonide  substrates  digested  with  an  important  pectin  degrading  enzyme,  endo-

polygalacturonse  II  (endo-PG  II)  from  Aspergillus  niger,  has  been  selected  as  a  model 

system,  so  that  the  generic  digestion  problem  can  be  discussed  while  producing  specific 

results  of  importance  for  many  areas  of  plant  science.  The  ubiquitous  occurrence  of  the 

polysaccharide pectin in the cell walls of land plants, taken together with the large number of 

pectin-modifying enzymes encoded in the  genomes of plants  [26]  and their pathogens, [27] 

clearly points to the importance of pectin, and pectin derived compounds, in diverse aspects 

 

 

 

3

of plant physiology. Indeed, the products of pectin digestion, the oligogalacturonides, play a 

key  role  in  triggering  plant  defence  [28].  Endo-PG  II  has  been  classified  as  a  family  28 

glycosyl hydrolase and proceeds by an inverting mechanism [29, 30]. Its preferred substrate is 

galacturonic  acid  but  it  can  also  digest  partially  methylesterified  galacturonides  and  co-

polymers of galacturonic acid and its methylesterified counterpart (pectin), although there is 

an  absolute  requirement  for  sub-sites  -1  and  +1,  which  straddle  the  scission  point,  to  be 

unesterified  [31].  Its  sequence  and  crystal  structure  have  been  determined  and  a  number  of 

mutants  have  been  studied  [32,  33-35].  Bond  cleavage  frequencies  have  also  been  obtained 

for  the  degradation  of  galacturonic  acid  oligomers  up  to  the  hexamer,  allowing  sub-site 

binding energies to be mapped [31]. In addition, while tetramers and trimers each have only 

one productive binding mode that spans the active site, the relative kinetics of fragmentation 

[36]  can  provide  differential  binding  energy  estimates  and  hence  probe  the  affinity  of  the 

extra  sub-site  involved  in  tetramer  degradation.  Fig.  1  shows  the  current  best  model  of  the 

endo-PG II sub-site architecture.  

2. Materials and Methods 

2.1 Oligomeric Substrate 

 

 

 

A  set  of  oligogalacturonides  containing  degrees  of  polymerization  between  2  and  17  was 

generated  by  selective  precipitation  of  a  partially  digested  polygalacturonic  acid  (PGA)  as 

described  previously  [37].  Briefly,  a  2%  (w/v)  solution  of  the  free  acid  of  PGA  in  50  mM 

lithium  acetate  at  pH  4.7  was  digested  with  0.05  U  mL-1  EPG  (Lot  00801,  Megazyme 

International  Ireland  Limited,  Bray,  Ireland)  for  4.5  hrs  at  room  temperature  with  constant 

stirring.  The pH of the digested LiPGA was lowered to 2.0 with concentrated HCl and stored 

overnight at 4 °C.  The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 23,500 g for 30 min at 4 

4

°C.  The pelleted precipitate, representing high DP oligomers was removed. The supernatant, 

containing  the  low-  and  medium-DP  oligomers,  was  brought  to  50  mM  sodium  acetate 

(NaOAc) and 22.5% EtOH and then placed at 4 °C overnight to precipitate the medium-DP 

fragments  (DP  8-24).    Following  centrifugation  as  described  above,  the  supernatant  was 

decanted. The pelleted material was solubilized in 50 mM LiOAc and then re-precipitated by 

adjusting  the  solution  to  50  mM  NaOAc  and  22.5%  EtOH.    This  material,  representing  the 

medium-DP  oligomers,  was  centrifuged  again  and  the  pellets  were  solubilized  in  50  mM 

LiOAc  and  stored  at  4  °C.  Initial  characterisation  was  carried  out  using  HPAEC  with  an 

evaporative 

light  scattering  (ELS)  detector  [38,39]  and  subsequently  by  capillary 

electrophoresis using UV detection [19, 22].  

2.2 Enzymes  

Endo-PG II (EC 3.2.1.15) from Aspergillus niger was prepared as described previously [40]. 

Digests  were  carried  out  by  incubating  1.0  ml  of  the  oligogalacturonide  mixture,  at  a  total 

concentration of 3 % galacturonic acid, and pH 4.2, with 20 µL of the enzyme solution, that 

was in turn generated by diluting 25 µL of a 7.5 mg ml-1 protein stock into 2.0 mL of 50 mM 

acetate buffer at pH 4.2. All experiments were carried out at (30±1) °C by keeping the digest 

mixture  in  a  waterbath.  At  various  times  aliquots  were  removed,  the  enzyme  denatured  by 

rapid  heating  to  95  °C,  and  the  current  concentrations  of  the  various  oligomeric  species 

recorded using CE. Thus a picture of the time-course of the digestion was recorded.  

2.3 Capillary Electrophoresis  

Experiments  to  separate,  identify  and  quantify  oligogalacturonides  of  varying  degrees  of 

polymerisation  were  carried  out  using  an  automated  CE  system  (HP  3D),  equipped  with  a 

diode  array  detector.  Electrophoresis  was  carried  out  in  a  fused  silica  capillary  of  internal 

diameter 50 µm and a total length of 46.5 cm (40 cm from inlet to detector). The capillary 

incorporated  an  extended  light-path  detection  window  (150  µm)  and  was  thermostatically 

 

5

controlled  at  25  °C.  Phosphate  buffer  at  pH  7.0  was  used  as  a  CE  background  electrolyte 

(BGE) and was prepared by mixing 0.2M Na2HPO4 and 0.2M NaH2PO4 in appropriate ratios 

and subsequently reducing the ionic strength to 90 mM. At pH 7.0 galacturonic acid residues 

are  fully  charged  and  while  the  oligomers  are  susceptible  to  base-catalysed  β-elimination 

above pH 4.5, no problems were encountered during the CE runs of some 20 minutes at room 

temperature. All new capillaries were conditioned by rinsing for 30 minutes with 1 M NaOH, 

30 minutes with a 0.1 M NaOH solution, 15 minutes with water and 30 minutes with BGE. It 

was found that for the samples used in this study similar harsh washing of the capillary was 

also required between runs. Detection was carried out using UV absorbance at 191 nm with a 

bandwidth of 2 nm. Samples were loaded hydrodynamically (various injection times at 5000 

Pa, typically giving injection volumes of the order of 10 nL), and typically electrophoresed 

across  a  potential  difference  of  20  kV.  All  experiments  were  carried  out  at  normal  polarity 

(inlet anodic) unless otherwise stated. Samples of mono-, di-, and tri-galacturonic acid, used 

as standards, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St.Lois, MO, USA. 

2.4 Simulation 

Oligomeric  distributions  of  starting  material  were  modelled  by  a  simple  one  dimensional 

array in which the elements were assigned to a character, L, M or R, denoting the left (non-

reducing  end),  middle,  and  right  (reducing  end)  of  chains.  Enzymatic  encounters  were 

presumed  to  occur  at  random.  Each  encounter  consisted  of  selecting  a  substrate  binding 

position  for  sub-site  -1  and  summing  the  binding  energies  for  all  filled  sub-sites  in  this 

position. It was assumed that each sub-site binding energy was unaffected by the presence or 

not  of  substrate  at  other  sites.  This  summed  energy  was  then  used  to  generate  a  Boltzman 

factor  that  determined  the  probability  of  successful  binding.  This  conversion  to  probability 

included  a  normalisation  of  the  binding  energy  to  that  of  7  filled  sub-sites  (the  accepted 

extent of the endo-PG sub-site architecture, as shown in Fig.1), so that such a contact always 

 

6

results  in  a  successful  binding  event.  Whether  the  binding  was  successful  or  not  was 

determined by comparing this probability with the output of random number generator from 

GNU Scientific Library [41]. Using this random number generator ensured that the frequency 

of low-probability events was simulated accurately. In successful binding cases, if sub-sites 

+1  and  -1  were  both  covered,  then  a  scission  was  made  and  the  array  elements  reassigned 

accordingly  in  order  to  denote  the  presence  of  new  chain  ends.  After  a  selected  number  of 

iterations the array was interrogated to produce a distribution of fragment lengths, and it was 

this  simulated  data  that  was  compared  with  the  experimentally  measured  time-course.  The 

simulation  was  carried  out  on  an  Intel  P4  computer  and  takes  only  seconds  to  complete  a 

simulated  digest  evolution  starting  with  104  substrate  molecules.  The  code  was  written  in 

C++,  compiled  with  Intel  C  Compiler  (Version  9),  and  was  executed  using  the  scripting 

language  Python  within  a  Linux  environment.  Initially,  solely  tetramers,  pentamers,  or 

hexamers  were  fed  to  the  enzyme  model  to  ensure  that  the  relevant  number  of  different 

product possibilities (i.e. the known bond cleavage frequencies) were reproduced.   

3. Results and Discussion 

Fig. 2 shows the quantification of the starting oligogalacturonide distribution as measured by 

both HPAEC with ELS detection and CE using UV absorption. The agreement between these 

two quite different methodologies is remarkably good and provides further confidence in both 

techniques. The CE data was processed in order to quantify the amount of different oligomers 

present, as described in detail elsewhere [22], ensuring that the peak area was divided by the 

migration  time  in  order  to  account  for  the  different  time  that  the  separated  species  spend 

travelling past the detection window [42]. The peaks were unequivocally identified by spiking 

with commercially available samples of dimer and trimer. CE has been used previously in the 

 

 

 

7

study  of  oligogalacturonides  and  it  is  known  that  above  a  certain  molecular  length  the 

hydrodynamic friction and charge scale symmetrically with the introduction of further sugar 

residues,  leading  to  a  loss  of  resolution.  While  the  exact  DP  at  which  this  occurs  and  the 

modelling  of  the  mobility  forms  part  of  ongoing  work  it  has  previously  been  predicted  to 

occur  at  around  DP  15-20  [43].  Bearing  this  in  mind  the  current  oligomer  mixture  was 

selected as the starting substrate in order to ensure it would be possible to record the time-

course of all starting oligomers. 

The initial input for the enzymatic fragmentation model was the relative number of molecules 

of each oligomer, generated from the average of the HPAEC data and three CE datasets. The 

only other parameters used are a best estimate set of the binding energies for the endo-PG II 

subsites, shown in Fig. 1. Preliminarily, the number of starting substrate chains that could be 

used in order for the simulation to generate reproducible results was determined. For a chosen 

initial number of chains a digest simulation was run for fixed number of time-steps, the value 

of  which  was  selected  based  on  preliminary  experimental  data,  and  the  resulting  pattern 

recorded. This was then repeated with the same number of chains so that 10 estimates of the 

resulting  pattern  (the  relative  number  of  the  different  DP  oligomers  existing  at  a  particular 

time) were obtained. From these a mean pattern was obtained, and the variance, σ2, of the 10 

repeats around this mean determined. This process was repeated for sets of solutions carried 

out  with  different  numbers  of  starting  chains,  (keeping  the  number  of  iterations  per  chain 

constant),  and  the  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  3.  It  is  clear  that  the  reproducibility  of  the 

calculation becomes better as more chains are used, as expected. An optimal starting value, 

taking into account the extra time required to perform the calculations for a greater number of 

chains,  was  deemed  to  be  104  substrate  molecules,  and  this  was  used  for  all  subsequent 

simulations.

Experimental data were obtained for the evolution of the enzyme digest pattern at 0, 2, 4, 6, 

8,  10,  15,  30,  45,  266,  and  13000  minutes  as  described  in  the  experimental  section.  A 

simulation of the digest process was also run. The simulated digest pattern data was typically 

stored  after  each  additional  200  iterations.  The  calculation  was  terminated  after  6*106 

iterations  at  which  time  the  changes  in  the  digest  pattern  consisted  solely  of  trimer  being 

slowly  fragmented  to  monomer  and  dimer,  with  a  further  106  iterations  generating 

concentration changes of a fraction of a percent. It is worth commenting at this point that it is 

experimentally observed that the trimer is indeed digested to the dimer and monomer but at a 

rate some 20 times slower than the tetramer degradation [36]. This rate is sufficiently slow as 

to essentially decouple the trimer processing from the rest of the digestion and therefore, in 

many  previous  studies,  the  relatively  long-lived  situation  with  a  similar  ratio  of  monomer, 

dimer  and  trimer  has  been  taken  practically  to  be  the  end  of  the  digestion.  In  the  model 

described  here  these  two  regimes  emerge  naturally  as  a  consequence  of  the  differential 

binding energies of the species of various lengths. 

Initially  the  experimental  and  simulated  digests  were  compared  by  eye  in  order  to  assess 

whether  there  were  calculated  digest  pattern  solutions  during  the  simulated  fragmentation 

process  that  manifested  the  experimentally  found  ratios  of  different  DP  oligomers. 

Encouraged  by  a  reasonable  agreement  in  the  general  time-course  of  the  digest,  a  simple 

searching  algorithm  was  subsequently  written  that  took  each  experimentally  determined 

digest  pattern  and  searched  through  the  calculated  data  in  order  to  find  the  particular 

simulation (corresponding to a certain number of iterations) that best matched, as determined 

by  a  simple  minimisation  of  the  standard  deviation  of  the  experimental  and  simulated 

datasets. As a prelude to the formation of the standard deviation the patterns concerned were 

9

both normalised so that the total amount of galacturonic acid was the same in both cases. A 

scaling of the  experimental  data total amount was permitted  during the pattern matching to 

allow  for  the  possibility  that  not  all  the  material  was  detected,  but  was  found  to  not  be 

significantly different from one when the matches were made. 

Fig. 4 shows the comparison of the experimental and calculated digest patterns for these best 

fits. In general there is excellent agreement, particularly when experimental uncertainties in 

the relative amounts are taken into account. It should also be born in mind that while it is the 

number  of  molecules  that  is  represented  in  these  plots  it  is  the  absorbance  that  is  actually 

detected  in  the  CE  experiments  reported  herein,  which  is  proportional  to  the  degree  of 

polymerisation  (with  a  minor  exception  for  the  monomer,  as  described  previously 

elsewhere [22]). This means that small amounts of the dimer and monomer, as predicted at 

the  beginning  of  the  simulation  are  difficult  to  detect  experimentally.  Nevertheless,  the 

agreement  is  good.  It  is  interesting  to  use  the  correspondence  of  the  simulated  and 

experimental  data  to  map  the  iteration  number  onto  real-time,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.  The  plot 

can be seen to show an excellent linear relationship up to 45 minutes, implying that despite 

the  relatively  simplistic  nature  of  the  model  including  the  random  nature  of  the  encounters 

and the lack of dynamics and molecular detail, nevertheless, the previously measured sub-site 

binding  energies  do  describe  the  time  dependence  of  the  real  reaction  well.  The  last  two 

points were more difficult to match to a specific time owing to the slowness of the evolution, 

but  simulations  terminated  at  the  number  of  iterations  that  correspond  to  such  long  times 

according to the data in Fig. 5 were indeed found to be consistent with the experimental data. 

While in detail the value of the gradient of such a plot will depend, among other things, on 

enzyme and substrate concentrations it could be argued that performing one time-step in the 

 

 

 

10

simulation  might  be  thought  of  as  modelling  a  substrate-enzyme  contact.  The  mapping  of 

real-time onto equivalent simulation time-steps then, as shown in Fig. 5 suggests that there is 

roughly  one  cut  attempt  every  6  ms,  that  is;  there  is  an  encounter  between  enzyme  and 

substrate  on  the  order  of  milliseconds.  A  simple  order  of  magnitude  calculation  of  the 

collision  frequency  can  be  made  by  distributing  the  enzyme  molecules  homogeneously 

throughout  the  solution  and  calculating  the  time  it  would  take  the  oligogalacturonides  to 

move  between  them  (the  diffusion  coefficient  of  the  protein  is  expected  to  be  at  least  ten 

times  less  than  the  sugar  oligomers).  Taking  the  enzyme  concentration  as  100  nM  and  an 

average substrate diffusion coefficient of 10-10 ms-2 gives an average encounter frequency in 

the tenths of milliseconds regime that agrees reasonably for such a simple model.  

We have shown then that the binding energies inferred from bond cleavage and kinetic data 

on  small  substrates  (DP<7)  can  be  utilised  in  a  physically  realistic  model  in  order  to 

reproduce the temporal evolution of the digest patterns of arbitrary mixtures of considerably 

longer starting substrates. This implies that, for this system at least, the binding energy of the 

sub-sites  is  not  significantly  modified  by  the  presence  or  not  of  substrate  in  neighbouring 

binding  sites,  and  further,  that  they  are  not  significantly  altered  by  any  straining  of  the 

substrate. 

Further  simulations  have  also  been  carried  out  in  order  to  assess  the  sensitivity  of  the 

predicted digest patterns to the values of the binding energies and hence address the question 

-  how  much  variation  could  you  have  in  the  binding  energy  values  before  you  obviously 

modify the form of the simulation and cannot match the experiments? The basic philosophy 

of these was the following. Twelve “times” were chosen and at each of these a digest pattern 

was simulated with the base, best estimate values of the endo-PG II sub-site energies as given 

 

 

 

11

in Fig. 1. These “times” were in fact the number of time-steps that gave digest patterns in the 

simulation that corresponded to experimental data recorded, some of which was shown in Fig 

4. Subsequently the binding energies were altered in a known manner and the simulation was 

re-run, this time calculating the digest pattern at each 200 iterations. A searching algorithm 

then  found  the  best  match  pattern  generated  by  the  simulation  using  the  modified  binding 

energies to the base case. The difference between this digest pattern, generated with modified 

energy  variants  and  that  calculated  with  the  best  binding  energies,  was  then  quantified  by 

means of a simple variance, as described above.  

Fig.  6  shows  the  results  for  a  representative  number  of  these  calculations.  Owing  to  the 

complexity of the combinatorial space of five binding sites, a simple approach was taken in 

which the binding energy of each sub-site was changed in isolation, between the limits of the 

original value minus 50 % to the original value plus 50 %, at 1 % increments. It can be seen 

that at very short times there is, as expected, little change in the calculated digest pattern even 

with large differences in the binding energies, simply reflecting the fact that there has been 

little  change  in  the  original  distribution  at  this  point.  However,  by  six  minutes  it  is  soon 

apparent that changing the binding energies of sub-sites +2, -4 and -5 leads to a substantial 

change in the digest pattern. In order to generate a significant change however, alterations in 

the binding energies of the relevant sub-sites need to be of the  order of 10-20 %. It is also 

clear  that  sub-sites  -2  and  -3  do  not  play  a  significant  role  in  determining  the  form  of  the 

digest  pattern  in  this  region,  as  expected,  at  a  time  when  no  degradation  of  tetramers  and 

trimers  will  have  occurred.  This  trend  essentially  continues  for  the  simulations  run  to  a 

number of time-steps equivalent to 10 minutes. Sill later in the time-course of the simulated 

digest, by 30 minutes, it becomes apparent that there has been such a substantial time period 

involving  the  fragmentation  of  the  smaller  species  that  binding  energy  value  of  sub-site  -5 

 

 

12

becomes less important than +2 and -4 in terms of generating the final pattern. Towards the 

end of the digestion process the fragmentation pattern can be seen additionally to be sensitive 

to increases in the affinity at site -3.  

In addition to carrying out these simulations, performed in order to show that the calculated 

form of the digest  pattern  is  sensitive to  the input values  used for  the binding energies, the 

ability  to  detect  variances  of  the  predicted  magnitudes  experimentally  has  also  been 

examined.  Fig. 7 shows the variances of predicted digest patterns, calculated with different 

binding  energy  variants,  from  that  experimentally  observed  at  10  minutes.  The  plot  clearly 

shows that if the binding energies of sites -5, -4 and +2 were modified by more than around 

10% then the match to the experimental data would be detectably worse. In conclusion then, 

the  fact  that  the  simulated  enzymatic  fragmentation  calculated  based  on  sub-site  binding 

energies  matches  experimental  data  is  indeed  significant;  changes  in  the  affinities  of 

individual  binding  sites  of  greater  than  10-20%  would  have  produced  detectable 

discrepancies in the ability of the simulated data to successfully match the experimental time-

course. 

4. Conclusion 

A  model  for  predicting  the  time-course  of  enzymatic  digestions  of  arbitrary  mixtures  of 

oligomeric or polymeric substrates has been described. The success of such a simulation has 

been demonstrated by modeling the fragmentation of a population of oligogalacturonides of 

varying degrees of polymerization, when digested by endo-polygalacturonse II (endo-PG II) 

from  Aspergillus  niger.  This  allows  sub-site  binding  energies  obtained  from  the  results  of 

bond  cleavage  and  kinetic  experiments,  carried out  on  oligomers  with  lengths  less  than  the 

13

 

 

 

 

number  of  sub-sites  in  the  binding  cleft,  to  be  used  to  predict  the  evolution  of  the  relative 

amounts of different products during the digestion of mixtures of arbitrarily long oligomeric 

or  polymeric  substrates.  The  different  phases  of  digestion  within  the  fragmentation  process 

naturally evolve from the differential binding energies of different DP substrates. This simple 

homo-polymeric case serves to demonstrate the promise of the technique and current work is 

involved  in  extending  the  modeling  to  the  fragmentation  of  co-polymers,  in  which  the 

different residue types can have different binding energies to the enzyme sub-sites.

Fig. 1. The current best model of the endo-PG II sub-site architecture, showing the position of 

the active site and the binding energies associated with the different sub-sites, that have been 

used  in  this  work.  Sub-site  binding  energies  for  sites  -5,  -4  and  +2  have  been  taken  from 

studies  of  bond  cleavage  frequencies;  that  for  -3  from  the  relative  kinetics  of  tetramer  and 

trimer degradation; and that for -2 arbitrarily selected. 

Fig. 2. The quantification of the starting oligogalacturonide distribution as measured by both 

HPAEC and CE.  

Fig. 3. The variance within sets of 10 repeat simulations carried out with different numbers of 

starting chains. The inset shows the data on a logarithmic axle. 

Fig.  4.  The  comparison  of  the  experimental  and  calculated  digest  patterns  at  selected  times 

during the fragmentation of a starting oligogalacturonide solution with endo-PG II.  

Fig. 5. The number of iterations required in the simulation in order to generate a simulated 

digest pattern that best matches that found experimentally at the corresponding time. 

Fig.  6.  The  variance  between  calculated  digest  patterns  generated  i)  with  the  best  estimate 

sub-site  binding  energies  and  ii)  with  the  indicated  sub-site  energy  specifically  modified  in 

isolation, between the limits of the original value minus 50 % to the original value plus 50 %, 

at 1 % increments. (a) 2 minutes, (b) 10 minutes, (c) 30 minutes, 13000 minutes. 

Fig.  7.  The  variances  of  predicted  digest  patterns,  calculated  with  different  binding  energy 

variants, from that experimentally observed at 10 minutes. The plot clearly shows that if the 

binding  energies  of  sites  -5,  -4  and  +2  were  modified  by  more  than  around  10%  then  the 

match to the experimental data would be detectably worse.

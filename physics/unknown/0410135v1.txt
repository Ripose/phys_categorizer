ABSTRACT 

A  large  diameter  plasma  over  300  mm  in  diameter  is  produced  by  electron  cyclotron  resonance  (ECR) 

discharges using  a newly  developed  large diameter  chamber  of 400  mm  in  inner diameter.  It  is  found  that  the 

electron temperature decreases as nitrogen gas is added to pure argon plasma, which is considered that nitrogen 

molecules  absorb  the  electron  energy  into  the  vibrational  energy  and  lead  to  the  decrease  of  the  electron 

temperature.  Moreover,  it  is  found  that  the  plasma  uniformity  is  improved  by  adding  nitrogen  gas,  suggesting 

that the adjunction of nitrogen gas is effective for producing uniform and low electron temperature plasma. 

1. 

Introduction 

Recently, a large diameter plasma with the diameter more than 300 mm has been required in industry. Electron 

cyclotron  resonance  (ECR)  plasma  [1-3]  has  great  advantages  for  plasma  application  such  as  high  electron 

density, low gas pressure operation and low contaminations compared with other plasma sources. However, the 

electron temperature in ECR plasma is relatively high so that the charge up damage is often caused on substrates. 

Thus,  to  produce  a  large  diameter  ECR  plasma  with  low  electron  temperature  is  one  of  the  most  important 

subjects for plasma application. 

In order to control the electron temperature, some methods have been reported such as grid method [4], pulse 

modulation  [5]  and  use  of  low  frequency  microwaves  [6].  Itagaki  et  al.  succeeded  in  decreasing  the  electron 

temperature  by  using  the  mirror  magnetic  field  and  found  that  the  decreasing  effect  was  enhanced  by  adding 

nitrogen  gas  to  argon  plasma  [7].  It  is  considered  that  nitrogen  molecules  absorb  the  energy  of  electrons  and 

cause  the  low  electron  temperature  [8].  However,  the  relationship  between  the  electron  temperature  and  the 

nitrogen gas concentration has not been investigated yet. Here, we report the production of a large diameter ECR 

plasma by using a newly developed large diameter chamber and the investigation of the relationship between the 

electron temperature and the nitrogen gas concentration. 

2.  Experimental setup 

Figure  1  shows  the  schematic  diagram  of  the  experimental  apparatus.  The  newly  developed  large  diameter 

chamber  was  a  cylindrical  vacuum  chamber  made  of  stainless  steel  with  an  inner  diameter  400.4  mm  and  a 

length 1200 mm. The magnetic coil assembly consisted of eight electromagnetic coils. Positions and currents of 

the  coils  were  variable  to  form  various  magnetic  field  configurations.  The  frequency  of  microwaves  was  2.45 

GHz and the power could be increased up to 1.3 kW. Microwaves were launched into a chamber as a circular 

TE11 mode through the tapered waveguide and the quartz window. The matching between the microwave circuit

and  the  plasma  was  adjusted  with  the  three-stub  tuner  in  such  a  way  that  the  reflected  microwave  power 

monitored  by  power  monitor  was  as  low  as  possible.  Rotary  pump  and  2000  l/s  turbo  molecular  pump  were 

connected to evacuate the chamber. After evacuating to a base pressure less than 4×10-6 Torr, argon and nitrogen 

gases  were  introduced  into  the  chamber  through  mass  flow  controllers.  The  density  and  the  temperature  of 

electrons were measured with a cylindrical single Langmuir probe (1 mm diam. and 1 mm length).

3.  Results and discussion 

Firstly, we attempted to generate a large diameter plasma by using a new device. In general, the ion saturation 

current is proportional to the electron density of plasma. Therefore, it is convenience way to measure the profile 

of the ion saturation current in order to know that of the electron density. Figure 2 shows the radial profile of the 

ion saturation current as a function of the incident microwave power. The gas pressure was kept at 2 mTorr. It is 

clearly seen that the large area plasma with diameter over 300 mm is obtained successfully. It is found that the 

radial profile of the ion saturation current changes from flat profile to convex profile as the microwave power is 

increased. This change is considered to be the effect of extra ordinary wave (X wave). It is known that X wave 

which propagates perpendicular to the magnetic field causes upper hybrid resonance and contributes to plasma 

generation near the wall region when the electron density becomes around the L cutoff, 1-2×1011 cm-3 [9]. In fact, 

the measured electron density where the radial profile changed was corresponding with this value.

  Ueda et al. found that the plasma uniformity is controlled by changing the gradient of the magnetic field at 

the  resonance  position  [10].  This  is  because  the  power  absorption  is  changed  by  changing  the  gradient  of  the 

magnetic field. Thus, in order to improve the plasma uniformity, the radial profiles of the electron density under

different  magnetic  field  configurations  were  investigated.  Figure  3  shows  radial  profiles  of  the  ion  saturation 

current for different magnetic field configurations, where the gas pressure is 2 mTorr and the incident microwave 

power is 1.2 kW. As shown in Fig. 3, the radial profile of the plasma density changes from peaked profile (b) to 

flat profile (a) by changing the magnetic field configuration. In the case of magnetic field configuration (a), flat 

density profile with the uniformity about 15 % was obtained.

the electron density (below). 

Secondly,  we  investigated  the  relationship  between  the  electron  temperature  and  the  nitrogen  gas 

concentration. Figure 4 shows the electron temperature and the electron density as the function of the nitrogen 

gas concentration. The nitrogen gas concentration αN2 was determined as follows; αN2=SN2/(SN2+SAr). Here SN2 

and SAr denote the gas flow rate of nitrogen gas and argon gas, respectively. The total gas pressure was kept at 2 

mTorr and the incident microwave power was 1.0 kW. It is found that the electron temperature decreases as the 

nitrogen gas concentration is increased up to 20 %. It is considered that the decrease of the electron temperature 

was due to the absorption of the electron energy into the vibrational energy of nitrogen molecules. As shown in 

Fig. 5, nitrogen molecules have a large vibrational cross section at low energy of 2 eV [11]. On the other hand, in 

the  case  of  argon  gas,  the  electron  energy  is  mainly  absorbed  into  the  collision  energy  between  electrons  and 

argon atoms, which shows a large peak at high electron energy range of 10-100 eV. In our system, the electron 

temperature  was  below  10  eV.  Therefore,  it  is  considered  that  the  effect  of  energy  absorption  by  nitrogen 

molecules was larger than that by argon atoms and caused the decrease of the electron temperature. As shown in 

Fig. 4, the electron temperature begins to increase when the nitrogen concentration is increased more than 20 %. 

This  increase  of  the  electron  temperature  is  considered  as  the  result  of  the  increase  of  the  plasma  loss,  since

nitrogen molecules and nitrogen atoms are light compared with argon atoms. It is well known that the electron 

temperature generally increases to sustain the plasma when the electron density decreases. In fact, as shown in 

Fig. 4, the electron density decreases with the increase of the nitrogen gas concentration. The other candidate is 

upper hybrid resonance excited by X wave. If the hybrid resonance occurs, electrons gain the energy from the 

wave and the electron temperature increases. Further measurement is needed for verification.

Figures  6  and  7  show  the  pressure  dependence  of  the  electron  temperature  and  the  electron  density, 

respectively.  The  incident  microwave  power  was  1  kW.  As  shown  in  Fig.  6,  the  electron  temperature  in 

argon/nitrogen plasma is about 0.3 eV lower than that in pure argon plasma under all gas pressure conditions. 

Therefore,  it  is  concluded  that  the  addition  of  nitrogen  gas  for  decreasing  of  the  electron  temperature  is 

applicable  in  wide  range  of  pressure.  As  shown  in  Fig.  7,  the  pressure  dependence  of  the  electron  density  in 

argon/nitrogen  plasma  is  small  compared  with  that  in  pure  argon  plasma.  This  result  may  be  due  to  the  large 

plasma  loss  of  argon/nitrogen plasma.  However,  the  electron density  of  argon/nitrogen plasma  (αN2=10 %)  is 
sufficient for plasma application (about 2×1011cm-3). 

Moreover, it was found that the radial uniformity of plasma was improved by adding nitrogen gas. Figure 8 

shows the radial profile of the ion saturation current in the case of argon/nitrogen plasma. It is clearly seen that 

the radial profile became flatter compared with the case of pure argon plasma, Fig.2. The plasma uniformity in 

300 mm diameter was improved from ±14.0 % to ±7.7 % by adding the nitrogen gas. Therefore, it is considered 

that the addition of the nitrogen gas is effective to generate the uniform plasma.

configuration. 

In this paper, a large diameter ECR plasma was produced using a newly developed large diameter device and 

the relationship between the electron temperature and the nitrogen gas concentration was investigated, in detail. 

We  succeeded  in  producing  large  diameter  plasma  with  diameter  over  300  mm.  It  was  found  that  the  plasma 

profile changed from flat to concave when the incident microwave power was increased. This was considered as 

the effect of X wave. It was also found that the plasma uniformity is improved by adjusting the magnetic field 

On the other hand, the electron temperature decreased as the nitrogen gas concentration was increased up to 

20 %. It was considered that the electron energy was absorbed into the nitrogen molecular vibrational energy and, 

as the result, the electron temperature decreased. It was found that the addition of nitrogen gas is applicable in 

wide  range  of  the  operating  gas  pressure  and  the  electron  density  of  argon/nitrogen  plasma  (αN2=10  %)  is 

sufficient  for  plasma  application.  Moreover,  it  was  found  that  the  plasma  uniformity  is  improved  by  adding 

nitrogen  gas.  Therefore,  it  is  concluded  that  the  addition  of  nitrogen  gas  to  pure  argon  plasma  is  effective  for 

producing a uniform plasma with low electron temperature.

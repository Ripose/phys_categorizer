Gaining work from thermal fluctuations without external input energy  is a 
dream for scientists but is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics1-3. 
Feynman    proposed  a  molecular  ratchet  toward  this  direction  but  there  are 
still  theoretical  arguments  against  it1-2. Here,  we  revisit  this  classical  problem 
by using molecular dynamics simulation to monitor water molecules confined 
in  a  carbon  nanotube.  A  spontaneous  directional  transportation  of  water 
molecules  was  observed  in  this  symmetrical  nanochannel  by  a  ratchetlike 
mechanism.  This  is  the  first  ratchetlike  system  without  any  asymmetrical 
structure  or  external  field,  while  the  asymmetric  ratchetlike  potential  solely 
results  from  the  transported  water  molecules  that  form  hydrogen-bonded 
chains among themselves. Importantly, the resulting net water fluxes reached 
the  level  of  biological  channel4,  suggesting  possible  adoption  by  life.  This 
effect  is  ascribed  to  the  exceptive  structure  of  the  water  molecule;  a  minute 
change  in  hydrogen-bond  strength  dramatically  affects  permeation.  The 
duration of the spontaneous directed transportation is long (10,000 times over 
that of thermal fluctuation) but limited and it does not violate the second law of 
thermodynamics.   
 

 

The  problem  with  Feynman’s  molecular  ratchet  is  that  he  tried  to  get  a 
“permanent”  directional  motion  without  external  input  energy1,2.  From  a  practical 
point  of  view,  however,  “permanence”  may  not  be  necessary  and  we  only  need 
duration for the  directional motion  to be  long enough for a certain application. This 
gives  us  a  new  direction  to  design  a  practical  molecular  ratchet.  Through  its  unique 
properties,  spontaneous  transport  of  water  molecules  can  be  achieved  in  a 
single-walled  carbon  nanotube  (SWNT),  exhibiting  a  ratchetlike  behavior.  The 
duration  for  such  transport  is  finite  but  long,  reaching  the  timescales  of  biological 
applications. In addition, the symmetrical nature of the channel rules out the difficulty 
in a conventional molecular ratchet in which the thermal  noise on the  indispensable 
asymmetrical structure has the same level of magnitude with the rectified directional 
motion,  resulting  in  the  subtle  probabilistic  balance  and  a  negligible  output1-3.  The 
success  of  our  approach  is  also  attributed  to  the  confinement  of  matter  at  the 
nanoscale, which usually results in surprising phenomena not seen in bulk systems5-8. 
The  SWNT  is  uncapped  and  has  13.4  Å  in  length  and  8.1  Å  in  diameter.  To 
mimic  the  biological  channels  in  a  membrane9-13,  the  SWNT  was  embedded  in  a 
graphite sheet along the z-axis. The single graphite sheet divided both the full space 
and  the  SWNT  into  two  equal  parts.  The  SWNT  together  with  the  graphite  sheet 
solvated in a water reservoir was simulated for 372 nanoseconds (ns) with molecular 
dynamics and last 360 ns were collected for analysis.

across  the  SWNT  along  the  dipole  orientation  in  each  state,  comparable  to  that  of

The water molecules in the SWNT form a single hydrogen-bond chain. The OH 

bonds  involved  in  hydrogen  bonds  are  nearly  aligned  along  the  nanotube  axis  and 
collectively  flip  in  their  orientations5,12,14.  To  quantify  the  orientation  of  the  water 
chain,  the  average  angle  φ   was  defined12,  where  φ  is  the  angle  between  a  water 

molecule dipole and the z-axis, and average runs over all the water molecules inside 

the  tube.  For  most  of  the  time,  φ   fell  into  two  ranges,

0 , hereafter called + dipole and - dipole states, respectively. The typical 

cases  for  + dipole  and  - dipole  states  are  illustrated  in  Fig.  1  (A,  B).  The  average 
duration T for each state was 2.6 ns. For each state with duration larger than 1 ns, data 
were collected for further analysis.   

We have obtained a total of 152 ns in the + dipole state from simulation. During 
those time periods, 1,643 molecules passed through from bottom to top of the SWNT, 
and 824 molecules did so from top to bottom, resulting in an average net flux of 5.4 
ns-1  along  the  +z  axis.  The  corresponding  data  are  564,  1113,  and  -5.4  ns-1, 
respectively, during 102 ns of the - dipole state. 

It  is  believed  that  the  spontaneous  directional  motion  arising  from  a  thermally 
fluctuating environment is generally ascribed to the ratchet effect1-3,15-20. The ratchet 
effect has been successfully applied in man-made devices15,16 as well as in biological 
processes17-19. Conventionally, an external asymmetric structure is always required to 
construct a ratchet potential if there is no external field1-3,15-20. In our case, however, 
the  SWNT  was  symmetrical  and  no  external  field  was  applied.  The  remarkable 
directional net flux of water molecules results from the asymmetric potential of mean 
force (PMF), which acts as a ratchet potential17. The asymmetry in PMF solely comes 
from  the  one-dimensional  water  chain  with  a  concerted  dipole  orientation.  In  Fig. 
1(C),  we  have  shown  the  PMFs  of  water  molecules  inside  the  SWNT,  denoted  by

systematic  displacement  along  the  +z  direction  compared  with  that  of  the  +  dipole 
state.  The  difference  between  them  can  be  seen  more  clearly  in  Fig.  1(C)  (bottom).

note  that  the  remarkable  unidirectional  fluxes  in  + and  –  states  had  no  relation  with 
the  pulse-like  transmission  on  both  sides  of  water  presented  by  Hummer  et  al.  (See 
detail in Supplementary Information). In contrast, the direction and magnitude of the 
average  unidirectional  flux  were  definitely  determined  from  the  PMF  of  the 
transported water molecules themselves. The discovery benefited from our analysis of 
data according to the direction of the concerted hydrogen-bonding orientations. 

Interestingly, the average net flux for each state was comparable to the measured

comparable  water  flux  through  a  SWNT  and  aquaporin-1  by  previous  molecular 
dynamics  simulations,  the  necessary  osmotic  pressures  difference  was  about  1,000 
bars12,21, which is too big, compared with that in a living cell (~5 bars). Here the big 
pressure difference is not required and the net water fluxes for + or – dipole states are 
still  sufficiently  large,  showing  that  the  single-file  hydrogen-bond  chain  is  efficient 
enough  to  achieve  rapid  permeation  and  reach  a  net  flux  of  biological  level.  This 
phenomenon  hints  that  the  quaint  use  of  this  mechanism  is  a  possible  choice  for 
biological water channels to achieve rapid water transportation with high selectivity.   
This  directional  motion  of  water  molecules  can  be  maintained  for  a  long  time. 
The  average  duration  T (=2.6  ns)  for  each  state  reaches  the  timescale  of  many 
biomolecular functions22 such as dissociation of CO, motion of the iron and tilting of 
the heme23. Moreover, average duration can be simply increased in a longer SWNT as 
shown  in  Fig.  2.  Although  the  net  flux  (Fig.  2)  decreases  for  a  longer  SWNT,  we 
believe that a larger duration, together with a larger net flux, may be conceivable in 
other  kinds  of  nanochannels  by  modifying  other  factors  such  as  channel-water 
interaction potentials. Compared with that for biological gating, 
  is still very small. 
Considering  the  complexity  of  the  protein  channels,  one  may  agree  that  there  are 
spaces  to  extend  the  duration  much  longer  for  each  water  chain  orientation  state  in 
biological channels.

Since  the  stable  directional  transportation  of  water  molecules  can  maintain 
10,000 times the scale of thermal fluctuations (~0.1ps) or even longer, one may gain 
useful  work  by  an  elegant  external  trigger  (the  energy  output).  We  note  that  such 
molecular  machine  does  not  violate  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics.  The  total 

duration for both dipole states should be equal and the average net water flux vanishes 
when the timescale approaches infinity if there is not any external perturbation on the 
nanotubes and water molecules. Each + and - state is only the equilibrium (orientation) 
fluctuation  like  a  gas  molecule  in  a  free  path.  Our  approach  greatly  prolongs  the 
10− s to nanoseconds or longer and 

thermal fluctuations from the typical timescale of
net directed water transportation is achieved within an orientation fluctuation.   

13

Evans  et  al.  found  that  entropy  decreased  for  small  macroscopic  dynamical 
systems  over  short  time  scales,  in  which  thermal  fluctuation  was  not  taken  into 
account24.  Kelly  et  al.  designed  a  molecule  containing  a  triptycene  together  with 
helicenes and observed spontaneous uni-directional rotations of the triptycene over a 
very  short  time  period25.  To  our  understanding,  those  observations  result  from  the 
short  timescales  in  which  only  one  or  few  fluctuations  are  observed.  It  should  be 
noted  that  these  studies  focused  on  challenging  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics. 
However, we find here that useful work can be gained without external input energy 
in  a  long  time  period  within  an  orientation  fluctuation,  and  it  does  not  violate  the 
second  law.  This  is  quite  amazing--imagine  that,  once  the  timescale  for  such 
(orientation)  fluctuations  approaches  to  the  timescale  of  human  life,  one  may  only 
observe one or few fluctuations if there were no external perturbations on the system. 
Useful  work  may  be  gained  without  input  energy  in  quite  a  long  time  that  a  person 
may not be able to see the end in those systems. 

To  further  evaluate  the  importance  of  hydrogen  bonds  of  water  molecules,  we 
modify the point charges on atoms O and H of the water model so that both number 
and  strength  of  hydrogen  bonds  are  changed,  just  like  what  the  others  did5,26.  The 
average duration for each state is only 0.4 ns and the average net water flux in each 
dipole state was less than one when the point charges were reduced to 90% of their 
original values. We cannot obtain a stable directed motion of water molecules. On the 
other hand, when the point charges got 10% larger, a liquid-gas transition was found. 
Thus, it seems that water has the right point charges on H and O to keep the proper 
hydrogen bond strength so that both net flux and average duration for each state are 
large  enough.  Given  that  the  generation  of  the  directional  movement  from  thermal 
fluctuations  is  critical  for  the  phenomena  of  biological  organization  and  dynamics, 
this  finding  might  be  helpful  in  understanding  why  water  is  so  exceptive27  and  is 
called life’s matrix28. 

 
Method   
Molecular dynamics simulations   
A  single  graphite  sheet  divided  the  full  space  into  two  parts.  An  uncapped, 
single-walled carbon nanotube29 is embedded in the center of the graphite sheet along 
the z direction. The distance between both ends of the SWNT and the graphite sheet is 
equal. The 144-carbon (6,6) nanotube is formed by folding a graphite sheet of 5× 12 

carbon  rings  to  a  cylinder,  and  then  relaxing  with  the  interaction  between  carbon 
atoms.  This  interaction  is  described  by  the  parameterized  potential  by  Brenner30, 
according to the Tersoff formulation31. Initially water molecules are filled in the other 
space  of  the  system,  except  for  the  channel  of  the  SWNT.  Periodic  boundary 
conditions are applied in all directions.

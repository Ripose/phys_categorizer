Abstract 

The ultimate sensitivity of optical detection is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 

The  first  part  of  the  paper  shows  that  coherence  plays  an  important  role  in  the  noise 

analysis. Although interference between an auxiliary wave and a signal wave makes the 

photo  detector  response  to  the  signal  stronger,  the  coherent  noise  also  enhances.  This 

makes  insignificant  the  gain  in  the  SNR.  Pulsed-excitation  gated-detection  (PEGD)  is 

described and analyzed in the second part to show that 1) a high brightness of detected 

particles  is  not  a  prerequisite  for  a  high  SNR,  2)  optimized  parameters  of  the  PEGD 

protocol  demonstrate  interesting  bifurcation  making  a  sudden  jump  from  an  effectively 

continuous  regime  to  PEGD,  and  3)  photo-physical  properties  of  NV–  centers  in  nano 

crystals of diamond approach those ideal for PEGD.

Introduction 
 

Imagine  that  you  can  follow  the  course  of  a  single  virus  for  several  hours  and 

analyse  its  infection  path  [1]  or  that  you  are  able  to  monitor  delivery  of  few  drag 

molecules to a single cell.  This breath taking perspective may become one day a reality. 

The challenge is to signal a specific process out of several others running simultaneously 

on  crowded  background.  A  promising  idea  for  selective  visualisation  of  physical  and 

chemical  dynamics  in  biological  and  other    complex  systems  is  based  on  labelling  the 

objects  of  interest  with  chemically  inert,  nanometre-sized,    markers  which  can  be  non-

invasively  and  infinitely  long  observed  using  appropriate  optical  techniques  [1,  2,  3]. 

Although  the  selectivity  depends  on  the  contrast  which  the  marker  has  against  the 

background and a higher contrast is an advantage, the ultimate limitation for detection is 

a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This paper examines ways for noise minimisation in optical 

detection of nanoparticles.  

Generally,  all  markers  can  be  divided  into  two  groups  –  depending  whether 

coherent  or  incoherent  emission  is  the  dominating  signal  sent  by  the  particle  to  an 

observer or a photo detector. Direct detection of absorption is, as a rule, more difficult [4] 

and will not be considered in this paper.   

A  coherent  wave  can  be  manipulated  and  analyzed  using  interferometers  and 

other setups where interference plays a role.  For example, a scheme has been proposed 

for single-molecule detection by Plakhotnik et al [5], where the scattered wave interferes 

on the detector with an auxiliary reference wave. This idea has been explored by Lindfors 

et al. [6] and by Ignatovich et al [7]  for gold and other particles and has been advertised 

with  controversial  claims  about  its  superior  SNR.  We  will  analyse  this  type  of 

 

2 

measurements using a general description to show that, as a rule, only incoherent noise 

can be eliminated in any interferometric scheme.    

Incoherent emission (usually luminescence) has  an advantage of  having  specific 

spectral  and  temporal  characteristics.  Such  specificity  can  be  exploited  for  SNR 

enhancement.  This  paper  is  focused  on  optimizing  the  temporal  response.  We  will  see 

that  high  brightness  (number  of  photons  emitted  per  unit  time)  of  a  marker  is  not 

necessarily synergetic with a high SNR in the detected signal.

( ) 1

the  detector  and 

( )
r
θ = −

  on  the  other  half.  The  total  intensity  is  integrated  over  the 

detector  area  A.  The  split-detector  removes  contribution  from  space  symmetric 

fluctuations, for example, fluctuations of  power [7]. The fields relevant to the problem of 

detecting a nanoparticle are 1) the field scattered by the particle 

(

 expressed in a 

complex  representation,  2)  the  reference  field 

,  and    3)  the  background  field 

(
E r

)

(

. The background field comes from the sample and obscures the scattered field. 

In Eq. (1) the fields are treated classically and the noise is taken into account by assuming 

that  every  field  fluctuates.  When  the  overall  noise  of  the  acquired  data  is  calculated, 

(
E r

  in  (1)  can  be  neglected  because  the  scattered  field  is  relatively  week.  The

Without narrowing too much the applicability of the following calculations, we will make 

a  reasonable  assumption  that  the  probability  distribution  of 

ε r
( , )t

  is  symmetric  with 

respect to zero at every  point  r  of the detector. This assumption allows to disregard all 

terms proportional to an odd power of  ε . The question is – under what conditions can the 

addition of the reference field  

(

 improve the SNR?

values of 

sφ  and  εφ  are the phase differences between

fields  respectively.  Under  special  circumstances,  for  example,  when 

εφ π=

  at  every 

point  of  the  detector  area  (this  is  possible  only  if  the  intensity  but  not  the  phase  of  the 

background fluctuates), the SNR is proportional to 

rE . Note that 

sφ  should not be equal 

to 

/ 2π  for this to happen.  

In a general case, the reference field will enhance both the signal and the noise. It 

follows from Eq. (3) that the maximum achievable SNR satisfies the relation

stable auxiliary wave.   

Incoherent signal 

When the response of the marker is incoherent, temporal characteristics of this response 

can be used to improve the SNR. The pulsed-excitation gated-detection (PEGD) protocol 

works  as  follows.  A  pulsed  laser  periodically  excites  emission  of  the  marker  which  is 

then integrated for time 

iτ . Every exciting pulse is assumed to be very short (δ-pulse) 

and the integration starts with a delay 

dτ   after each pulse. The laser pulse excites both 

emission  of  the  marker  characterized  with  a  decay  time 

sτ   and  a  background  decaying 

with  a  time  constant 

bτ .  A  continuous  excitation/detection  (CECD)  scheme  is  obtained  

by taking the limit 

dτ →  and 
0

iτ → . The transition from PEGD to CECD is gradual  

0

but    it  will  be  shown  that  an  almost  discontinuous  jump  from 

τ τ τ≫   to 

,d

b

iτ τ =  
0

,

d

happens  when  the  measurement  protocol  is  optimized  towards  the  highest  SNR  for 

different values of  

sτ .  

The  total  number  of  signal  photons  detected  within  the  measuring  time  τ  is 

n τ τ τ+

single quantum emitter, then  

1sa <  since a single emitter can emit only one photon per 

pulse. The SNR in such gated measurements reads

For  different  values  of

conditions in the sample  and  for different values of the noise parameter υ, the values 

of iτ   and 

dτ   can  be  optimized  for  maximization  of  the  SNR.    The  results  of  such 

optimization are presented in Figs. 1 and 2. The SNR in the CECD scheme for a special 

case

0υ=  (the second condition reduces the noise to the shot noise limit) is

used  as  a  normalization  factor  for   

SNR   shown  in  Figs.  1a  and  2a.  For  numerical 

analysis we assume that υ is either zero or 

 (this corresponds to a relative standard 

deviation of about 

610−  if the signal is integrated over 1 s  and 

bτ  is on the order of 1 ns). 

Two  distinct  regions  can  be  identified  in  both  panels.  The  region  to  the  left  from  the 

threshold area of 

bτ τ ≈ ÷

 is the region where CECD provides the best SNR. In this 

region, 

τ τ=

0

PEGD  is  advantageous.  In  the  PEGD  region,

τ
b

,  (see  Figs.  1b  and  2b),  the 

curves  are  practically  insensitive  to  the  values  of    υ  and  a  maximum  of  the  SNR  is 

achieved at 

bτ τ =

 for a range of

A  large  value  of

  even  if

Conclusion 

Interference  is  an  effective  way  for  eliminating  spatially  and/or  temporarily  incoherent 

noise  which  does  not  interfere  with  the  auxiliary  reference  wave.  But  this  method  is 

inefficient if significant coherent noise is present on the detector.  This conclusion backs 

 

8 

the  simplified  analysis  presented  in  [4].  The  PEGD  protocol  proves  to  be  an  effective 

“noise  eater”  if  its  parameters  are  optimized.  The  optimization  condition  makes  the 

choice  between  PEGD  and  CECD  very  sharp  and  practically  discontinuous.  Given  a 

typical value of 

bτ ≈ ÷

1 2 ns

, the 25 ns luminescence lifetime of NV– centers in diamond 

nano  crystals  [8,  9]  matches  well  the  optimal  for  the  PEGD  scheme  value  of 

bτ τ =
/

s

10 30
÷

. Therefore nano crystals of diamond activated with NV– centers promise 

to become ideal optical labels.

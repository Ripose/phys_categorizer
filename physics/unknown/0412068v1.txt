Special Theory of Relativity on Curved Space-time 

Abstract 

Space-time  measurements,  of  gedanken  experiments  of  special  relativity  need 

modification  in  curved  spaces-times.  It  is  found  that  in  a  space-time  with  metric  g,  the 

special relativistic factor  γ, has to be replaced by

γ
g

=

, where Vµ=(1,v,0,0),

νµ

VVg

µν

is the 4-velocity, and v the relative velocity between the two frames Examples are given 

for  Schwarzschild  metric,  Freidmann-Robertson-Walker  metric,  and  the  Gödel  metric. 

Among the novelties are paradoxical tachyonic states, with 

γ  becoming imaginary, for 

g

velocities less than that of light, due to space-time curvature. Relativistic mass becomes a 

function of space-time curvature, 

m =

, where Pµ=(E,p) is the 4-momentum, 

signaling a new form of Mach’s principle, in which a global object – namely the metric 

tensor,  is effecting interia.

Special Theory of Relativity on Curved Space-time 

1. Introduction 

It is generally considered that the laws of physics can locally be described in a flat 

space-time  setting.  This  is  described  by  the  statement  that  locally  any  space-time  is 

Minkowskian. However, space-time curvature can significantly effect local physics. One 

example  of  this  is  the  Hawking  radiation  [1].  Another  example  is  the  effect  of 

acceleration  on  reading  of  particle  detectors  in  curved  space-times  [2].  Space-time 

curvature effects local structure of light cone, and the behaviour of null geodesics. Since 

gedanken experiments of Special Theory of relativity (STR) are based upon propagation 

of light signals, therefore. it may be enquired, how would the various results of STR get 

modified, when the space-time is curved. 

 Special theory of relativity (STR) is based upon the Minkowski metric,

 effect  of  local  curvature,  in  the  form  of  components  of  metric  tensor,  µνg   may  be 

expected to  show up in  the  local  measurements.  The  line  element  of a null  geodesic  in 

both flat and curved space-times is characterized by,

This equations encodes the fundamental principle of STR, namely the constancy of speed 

of  light  in  all  inertial  frames.  It  turns  out  that  this  is  the  key  equation,  for  deriving 

equations for STR in both flat as well as curved space-times – derived in this paper.  In 

this paper we investigate this issue, and derive time dilation, length contraction, energy-

mass  relations  for  STR  in  a  curved  space-time  setting.  We  use  Schwarzschild  metric, 

Robertson-Walker metric, and Gödel metric, as examples for this.  

Now, consider the  familiar  gedanken experiment of special relativity in which a 

beam of light is sent from ceiling to floor of a train moving with velocity v, with respect 

to the ground. Let F   be the frame moving along with train, and Fground , be the frame 

fixed  to  ground.  Let  height  of  the  train  carriage  be  denoted  by  h.  Let  x  direction  be 

horizontal  along  the  ground,  and  y  direction,  vertical,  while  t  stands  for  the  time  co-

ordinate  in  Fground.  In  F    the  time  co-ordinate  is  represented  by  t’.  The  z  direction  is 

being ignored for the present. In a time interval dt, in frame Fground   the train travels a 

distance, 

floor of the train carriage, 

In  this  much  time  interval,  a  ray  of  light,  covers  the  distance  h,  from  the  ceiling  to  the 

dx =

vdt

. 

dy = . 

h

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(4) 

(5) 

In the frame F   moving along with train, time taken for this journey is dt’.

Let  the  metric  be  diagonal.  However,  the  result  derived  below  can  remains 

unchanged,  when  the  metric  has  an  off  diagonal  element  such  as 

10g .  Equating  line 

element of a null geodesic in the co-moving frame F,  to zero, one gets, 

Line element for null geodesic as seen in the ground fixed moving frame Fgruond, is,

In  a  general  relativistic  frame  work,  using  conformal  time,  g00  can  be  equated  to  1, 

for special relativistic transformations in a curved space-time with metric g. We note that 

the usual,

Next consider the gedanken experiment in which the ray of light is sent from one 

end of carriage to another in a horizontal direction. Let dx’ be the length of carriage in F   

and  dx  the  length  in  Fground..  A  mirror  is  mounted  on  the  other  end  of  carriage,  which 

reflects the ray back. Time for round trip in  F     is dt’, while in Fground it is dt. Equating 

line elements of null geodesics in F    and Fground to zero we have,

Proper velocity may be defined as, 

Effect of space-time curvature on relativistic mass 

gm can be calculated, using the usual 

collision experiment between two particles. Assuming the usual non-relativistic definition 

of momentum, as product of mass times velocity, along with law of conservation of (rest)

mass,  does  not  lead  to,  momentum  conservation  in  the  moving  frame.  Therefore  the 

momentum is re-defined  using proper velocity. Let subscripts A and B denote incoming 

particles,  and  C  and  D  outgoing  particles.  Conservation  of  momentum  between  the 

stationary and the moving frames, gives,

where,  the  superscript  0  on  ηindicates  stationary  frame.  The  law  of  conservation  of

where

5. Further work 

It  will  be  interesting  to  investigate  classical  and  quantum  fields,  with  modified 

STR  in  a  curved  space-time  setting.  Quantum  field  theory  replaces  energy-momemtum 

relations of STR by relations between energy-momentum operators. On a curved space-

time, modified STR energy-momentum relations would have to be implemented.  

Horizons in various space-times, such as FRW, black-holes, Gödel universe, AdS 

universe would have to be redefined for various inertial frames, taking into account their 

velocities. It would also be interesting to investigate effect on horizons, for accelerating 

Closed  Time-like  Curves  (CTCs)  occur  in  a  variety  of  situations  in  General 

relativity, and are a subject of an ongoing debate [5,6]. Some of them such as the worm 

hole  CTC  [7],  and  Gott  CTC  [8],  contain  velocity  appearing  in  components  of  metric 

tensor,  i.e.,  the  CTC  construction  is  based  upon  time  dilation  due  to  relative  velocity. 

Effect  of  STR  in  a  curved  space-time  setting,  on  these  CTCs  needs  to  be  considered. 

Certain other CTCs, such as the Gödel universe CTC [4], the Kerr black hole CTC [9],  

the Tomimatsu-Sato solution’s CTC [10], von-Stockum universe’s CTC [11], are linked

to  rotation.  Rotation  in STR  has  also  been  a  subject  of  extensive  debate  [12],  to  which 

discussions in this paper may contribute, via definition of

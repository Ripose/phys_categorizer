Physical Insight into the ‘Growing’ Evanescent 
Fields of Double-Negative Metamaterial Lenses 
Using their Circuit Equivalence

Abstract—  Pendry  in  his  paper  [Phys.  Rev.  Lett.,  85,  3966 
(2000)]  put  forward  an  idea  for  a  lens  made  of  a  lossless 
n = − ,  that  may  provide  focusing  with 
metamaterial  slab  with 
resolution  beyond  the  conventional  limit.  In  his  analysis,  the 
evanescent  wave  inside  such  a  lossless  double-negative  (DNG) 
slab  is  “growing”,  and  thus  it  “compensates”  the  decaying 
exponential  outside  of  it,  providing  the  sub-wavelength  lensing 
properties of this system. Here, we examine this debated issue of 
“growing  exponential”  from  an  equivalent  circuit  viewpoint  by 
analyzing  a  set  of  distributed-circuit  elements  representing 
evanescent wave interaction with a lossless slab of DNG medium. 
Our analysis shows that, under certain conditions, the current in 
series  elements  and  the  voltage  at  the  element  nodes  may attain 
the  dominant  increasing  due  to  the  suitable  resonance  of  the 
lossless circuit, providing an alternative physical explanation for 
“growing  exponential” 
lens  and  similar  sub-
in  Pendry’s 
wavelength imaging systems.

HE  idea  of  left-handed  (LH)  media,  which  dates  back  to 
1967 when Veselago [1] theoretically studied plane wave 
in  which  he  assumed  both 
propagation 
permittivity  and  permeability  simultaneously  having  negative 
real  parts,  has  attracted  a  great  deal  of  attention  in  recent 
years. Various problems and ideas involving such media have 
been  proposed  and  studied  by  many  research  groups.  One 
such  idea,  namely  a  lens with  possibility of perfect focusing, 
was  theoretically  suggested  by Pendry  in  [2]. In his analysis, 
Pendry  shows  how  evanescent  waves,  which  are  effectively

responsible  for  sub-wavelength  resolution,  impinging  on  a 
suitably designed slab of double-negative (DNG) [3] material, 
may  grow  exponentially  inside  such  a  slab,  and  how  this 
effect  may  “compensate”  the  decaying  exponential  taking 
place outside the slab [2]. This issue of “growing exponential” 
and subwavelength imaging has become the subject of interest 
for several  research groups  working  in  metamaterial research 
(see,  e.g.,  [4]-[7]).  Analogous  sub-wavelength  focusing  and 
growing  evanescent  distributions  have  been  demonstrated  in 
two-dimensional  negative-refractive-index  transmission  line 
structures [8]-[9]. 

of  metamaterial 

In one of our previous works, we have shown how a similar 
phenomenon of “growing exponential” may occur in pairs of 
“conjugate”  metamaterial  slabs,  i.e.,  pairs  of  DNG  and 
double-positive (DPS) slabs or pairs of single-negative (SNG) 
layers  such  as  epsilon-negative  (ENG)  and  mu-negative 
(MNG) layers [10]. In these cases, we have shown how wave 
tunneling,  transparency,  and  virtual  image  sub-wavelength 
displacement  may  be  achieved  under  a  proper  choice  of 
combinations

thicknesses,  independent  on  the  property  of  the  “outside” 
medium that surrounds the pairs of slabs. We attributed these 
findings  to  the  presence  of  an  “interface  resonance”  at  the 
boundary between the two conjugate slabs. It is worth noting 
that  these  pairs  of  conjugate  slabs  also  supported  growing 
evanescent  fields  internally  when  an  incident  wave  impinges 
on  them.  We  showed  how  the  “interface  resonance”  may  be 
explained  using

similar  resonances  and  growing  distributions  for  the  voltage

In the present work, we explain how Pendry’s lens may be 
viewed as a special case of a more general analysis of pairs of 
conjugate slabs described in our previous work [10] and how 
the  growing  evanescent  field  behavior  in  his  lens  may  be 
clearly  understood  using  anthe  equivalent  circuit  analogy.  
Some of our preliminary results in this work were presented in 
a recent symposium [11].

 is not important, 

since  both  the  forward-decaying  and  back-ward  decaying 
waves are considered  here. In the vacuum region to the right 
of  the  slab,  the  presence  of  only  the  transmitted  wave  with 
decaying exponential is assumed.

is  “growing”  for  both  polarizations.  As  we  show  in  the 
following,  an  equivalent  circuit  representation may  provide a 
similar, but arguably more familiar, behavior for voltages and 
currents  in  suitably  selected  distributed  circuit  elements,  thus 
providing new physical insights into this phenomenon.

It is worth noting that the transmission-line analogy may in 
general  offer  an 
interpretation  and 
interesting  physical 
alternative  insight, effectively linking the voltage and current 
distributions along a circuit network to their local counterparts 
represented  by  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields.  This  is  well 
known  in  the  DPS  case  [12],  but  it  is  easily  extended  to  the 
metamaterial parameters, as it has been shown in [8]-[10]. 

We  note  that  even  in  a  conventional  DPS  material,  where 
eqL   in  the  TM  case  and 

µ  and  ε  are  positive,  the  value  of 

2

2

, 

>

eqC   in  the  TE case may become negative,  when 
xk ω µε
i.e.,  for  an  evanescent  wave.  As  is  well  known,  a  negative 
equivalent inductance or capacitance at a given frequency may 
be interpreted effectively as a positive (dispersive) capacitance 
or  inductance  at  that  frequency,  respectively  [8],  [10]. 
Therefore,  for  the  TM  case  the  evanescent  plane  wave 
propagation  in  a  DPS  medium  may  be  modeled  using  a 
transmission  line  with  a  negative  series  inductance  per  unit 
length and a positive shunt capacitance per unit length, which 
effectively implies a positive series capacitance per unit length 
and a positive shunt capacitance per unit length. In such a C-C 
line,  which  is  a  ladder  network  made  of  capacitors,  currents 

and  voltages  cannot  “propagate”  along  the  line,  but  instead 
they  have  an  evanescent  behavior,  consistently  with  the 
electromagnetic  counterpart.  When  a  DNG  material  or  an 
ENG  or  MNG  medium  is  used,  their  suitable  equivalent  TL 
models  may  exhibit  anomalous properties consistent with  the 
features  of  wave  propagation  in  such  media.  In  general  one 
may  consider  Table  I  showing  the  equivalent  TL  model  for 
plane waves in lossless homogeneous isotropic media, with all 
possibilities for signs of the real part of their permittivity and 
permeability, both for the cases of propagating and evanescent 
waves.  When  losses  are  present,  µ  and/or  ε  have  complex 
values,  which  translates  into  positive  series  resistance  and/or 
shunt conductance in the TL model. 

If  we  now  consider  Pendry’s  lens  problem,  the  equivalent 
1-D  TL  model  may  be  depicted  in  Fig.  2,  where  a  TM 
evanescent  wave,  impinging  on  a  “matched”  DNG  slab,  is 
considered.  [The  TE  case  may  be  again  obtained  by  duality, 
i.e.,  every  inductor  (capacitor)  should  be  replaced  by  a 
capacitor  (inductor).]  In  the  figure,  we  have  considered

TL sections may be derived from Eq. (5). When the equivalent 
inductors  or  capacitors  are  negative,  in  the  figure  they  are 
respectively  shown  as  effective  capacitors  or  inductors,  i.e.,

The  signs  of  the  imaginary  wave  numbers  κ  in  the  C-C

propagating  factor.  For  what  concerns  the  signs  of  the 
characteristic  impedances  for  an  L-L  or  C-C  line,  we 
obviously expect to have inductive or capacitive characteristic 
impedance  for  these  lines,  respectively.  (A  more  rigorous 
demonstration  may  be  obtained  by  adding  a  small  amount  of 
losses  to  the  TL  parameters,  in  order  to  select  the  proper 
branches  of the square roots  with  positive  real part, similarly 
to  what  shown  in  [3].)  This  results  in  the  following

These  formulas  clearly  show  that,  unlike  the  case  of 
propagating  wave  interaction  with  this  DNG  slab  where  the 
impedances are matched [2], [3], for the evanescent waves the

two  media  are  not  impedance-matched,  since

This  “interface”  resonance  is  the  key  in  understanding  the 
anomalous  behavior  of  this  setup,  and  the  circuit  analogy 
gives a further insight into this phenomenon. 

Eq. (6) and the previous consideration, in fact, imply that at

argument,  we note  that effectively a  segment  of the C-C  line

that represents the matched DNG slab with the same thickness 
d .  In  fact,  we  expect  that  the  voltages  and  current  at  every 
node  i   are  the  same  as  those  at  the  corresponding  node  i′ . 
Therefore, the voltage and current at one end (node 0) of this 
“resonant  pair”  of  C-C  and  L-L  lines  (each  with  length  d) 
would  be  the  same  at  those  at  its  other  end  (node  0’),  which 
implies  that  this  pair  appears  to  become  “transparent”  to  the 
rest  of  the  structure.  This  also  means  that  if  in  the  C-C 
segment we have a decaying exponential voltage (which is the 
only  physical  possibility),  we  should  have  a  “growing 
exponential” voltage in the L-L segment in order to have the 
voltage nodes the same at the beginning and at the end of this 
pair.  In  fact,  due  to  the  multiple  reflections  at  the  two 
interfaces,  each  with  an  “infinite”  reflection  coefficient,  the 
“reflected  growing”  exponential  builds  up  in  the  steady-state 
regime  and 
impinging  decaying 
exponential  in  the  DNG  slab  by  itself.  It  is  important  to 
underline here that the presence of the “growing” exponential 
in  the  L-L  line  is  due  to  the  “interface”  resonance  at  the 
boundary  between  the  C-C  and  L-L  lines,  and  it  is  not  just 
only  due  to  the  L-L  line  (i.e,  the  DNG  slab)  by  itself  (as 
confirmed also by Eq. (8)). In other words, in a dual scenario 
if  we  had  a  “vacuum”  slab  sandwiched  between  two  semi-
infinite  DNG  half  spaces,  following  a  similar  argument  we 
would have seen the growing exponential in the vacuum slab 
region! 

totally  dominates 

the 

A  further  confirmation  of  the  presence  of  the  growing 
exponential in the L-L line segment sandwiched as in Figure 2 
may be found  directly by solving  such a circuit network. Let 
us excite this circuit with a steady-state time-harmonic voltage 
source 
excV   at  a  given  node  in  the  semi-infinite  C-C 
transmission  line  on  the  left  of  the  L-L  segment.  We  have 
shown above that the pair of L-L segment together with the d-
long  C-C  segment  is  in  resonance  and  thus  “transparent”  to 
the  rest  of  the  structure.  Therefore,  we  expect  to  have  the 
voltage  and  current  in  the  left  C-C  segment  to  be  related  as

of  thickness  d  may  be  justified  using  the  circuit  equivalence 
with the L-L and C-C lines. In fact, as we have mentioned in 
our  previous  work,  one  can  suggest  that  this  field  behavior 
may  also  exist  when  a  DNG  slab  is  juxtaposed  with  a 
“conjugate”  DPS  slab  of  the  same  thickness  (in  the  present

case, this DPS layer is part of the outside vacuum region), or 
an  epsilon-negative  (ENG)  slab  paired  with  a  mu-negative 
(MNG)  slab  of  equal  thickness  [10]  (and  these  cases  would 
show  total  transparency  independently  of  the  parameters  of 
the outside region surrounding the system).   

i.e., 

In principle, this anomalous transparency is independent of 
the thickness of the two slabs (or in Pendry’s lens of the DNG 
slab  itself),  as  long  as  the  slabs  have  equal  thickness  d . 
However, an important question may arise here: May we still 
have a growing exponential behavior inside the DNG slab (or 
equivalently inside the L-L line here), if its thickness becomes 
infinite, 
if  we  have  a  semi-infinite  DNG  space?  
According  to  the  analysis  presented  here,  the  answer  is  as 
follows:  we  need  both  interfaces  to  achieve  this  exponential 
growth, therefore this effect may not take place if the second 
interface  is  at  infinity.  Moreover,  due  to  the  multiple 
resonances/reflections that  are necessary for the  phenomenon 
to  build  up,  a  thicker  slab  should  be  more  sensitive  to  the 
inherent  losses  of  the  setup  and  more  time  should  be  also 
required for the phenomenon to build up and reach the steady-
state regime. Therefore, even if the second interface is too far 
apart  (and  not  at  infinity)  in  practical  systems  the  growing 
exponential  may  disappear.  This  is  consistent  with  the 
findings we have shown in [14]

We  know,  however,  that  an  interface  between  the  semi-
infinite  matched  DNG  and  DPS  media  may indeed  support a 
surface  plasmon  wave  [13].  In  this  case,  for  an  incoming 
evanescent  wave,  the  transverse  impedances  of  the  two 
i.e., 
regions  are  complex  conjugate  of  each  other,

, and therefore the Fresnel “reflection” and 
“transmission”  coefficients  for  such  an  incident  evanescent 
wave  become  infinite,  as  we  have  previously  found  for  each 
of  the  two  interfaces  in  the  circuit  analog.  We  reiterate  that 
this in principle does not violate any physical law, since these 
coefficients  here  describe  the  relation  between  an  “incident” 
evanescent  wave  and 
its  “reflected”  and  “transmitted” 
evanescent waves, neither of which carries any real power. So 
when we have a source in front of the interface between two 
semi-infinite  matched  DNG  and  DPS  media,  the  resonant 
surface  wave may be excited along the interface, resulting  in 
an infinitely large field value. However, on both sides of this

IV.  EFFECTS OF LOSS AND MISMATCH IN MATERIALS 

Thus far we have assumed complete losslessness and match 
between  the  DNG  and  the  outside  region.    When  loss  and/or 
mismatch  in  the  material  parameters  is  present,  we  expect  to 
have  certain  variations  to  the  field  distribution  in  this 
geometry,  and  as  the  DNG  slab  gets  thicker,  such  variations 
would be more sensitive to the presence of loss and mismatch, 
as  also  anticipated.  This  sensitivity  is  mainly  due  to  the

presence of the surface wave supported by the slab (notice that 
the matched slab without losses, in fact, does not support any 
surface  wave,  even  thought  the  two  interfaces  delimiting  the 
slab  would  do  so).  If  the  structure  supports  a  surface  wave 
,  in  fact,  the  reflection  and  transmission 
with  a  given 
coefficients for the DNG  slab  would no longer be flat for all 
xk ,  but  instead  would  experience  a  peak  (or  a  singularity  in 
case of no loss) at the value of 
xk  for which the surface wave 
is supported. This has been shown by others in several recent 
papers  studying this phenomenon  [15]-[17] and indeed limits 
the overall resolution to certain extent, which can still be sub-
wavelength value better than the conventional resolution. 

The  effects  of  loss  and  mismatch  may  again  be  explained 
by  the  equivalent  circuit  models  described  here.  In  the  ideal 
lossless  matched  case,  we  showed  that  for  any  value  of 
xk , 
  series  capacitors  are  all  in  resonance  with  the

  and  similarly  every

. 

The  quality  factor  Q ,  of  such  a  resonance  is  thus  infinitely 
large.  However,  the  loss  in  the  system  causes  the  quality 
factor  Q   to  become  finite, resulting in a quicker drop of  the 
xk   (for  which  the  equivalent  electrical 
transmission  for  high 
length of the TL increases). Moreover, the mismatch does not 
allow  a  “perfect”  resonance  between  the  inductors  and 
xk :  only  for 
capacitors  mentioned  above  for  all  value  of 

xk  such a resonance may still occur.

V.  CONCLUSIONS 

Considering  the  transverse  magnetic  (TM)  plane  wave 
interaction with Pendry’s “perfect” lens, we have shown how 
this problem may be treated equivalently as a finite segment of 
L-L line, representing the DNG slab for the evanescent wave, 
sandwiched between two semi-infinite segments of C-C lines, 
representing  the  outside  DPS  regions  for  the  TM  evanescent 
wave.  In  this  analogy,  voltages  and  currents  represent  the 
electric  and  magnetic  fields.  We  have  analyzed  the  overall 
circuit,  showing  the  possibility  of  explaining  the  growing 
exponential term for the electromagnetic field along the DNG 
segment  as  a  resonant  phenomenon  in  the  circuit,  with  an 
analogous  growth  of  voltage  and  current  distributions.  The 
model  is  effective  also  in  presence  of  losses,  which  are 
represented  by  resistances  and  conductances  and  may  give 
further  insights  into  the  anomalous  phenomenon  of  sub-
wavelength imaging utilizing metamaterials.

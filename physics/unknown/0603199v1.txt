An expression for the electromagnetic field energy density in a dispersive, lossy, left-

handed metamaterial, consisting of an array of split-ring resonators and an array of 

wires is derived. An electromagnetic field with general time-dependence is 

considered. The outcome is compared with previously published results. In the 

absence of losses, agreement with the general result for the energy density in a 

dispersive material is obtained. The formulae are verified using the finite-difference 

time-domain (FDTD) numerical method. The applicability of two commonly used 

permeability models to the problem of calculating the energy stored in an array of 

split-ring resonators is discussed.

1. Introduction 
 
There  is  now  a  strong  interest  in  the  properties  of  the  left-handed  metamaterials 

(LHM) [1-3]. Because of this, formulating the electromagnetic field energy density in 

such  materials  has  been  addressed  several  times  [4-7]  and  a  number  of  different 

methods have been deployed.  

 

As already pointed out [4] it ought to be the case that any conclusions that can 

be drawn concerning the electromagnetic energy density in a lossy dispersive material 

can  be  found  easily  in  the  literature.  However,  it  appears  that  a  precise  answer  is 

difficult  to  find  and  this  is  because  there  are  no  general  formulations,  valid  for

arbitrary  materials.  In  the  presence  of  dispersion  and  losses,  the  knowledge  of  the 

permittivity and permeability functions alone is insufficient to provide an expression 

for  the  stored  electromagnetic  energy  density  [7].  This  is  because  a  very  detailed 

model  of  the  microstructured  medium  under  investigation  is  needed.  Unfortunately, 

this means that the problem of finding the energy density has to be solved separately 

for every material.  

 

A  long  time  ago,  Loudon  provided  a  beautiful  discussion  on  how  to  include 

loss  in  the  electromagnetic  field  energy  [8].  In  this  age  of  metamaterials,  it  is 

important  to  see  to  what  extent  the  arguments  put  forward  by  Loudon  can  still  be 

used. In addition to the question of loss it is also important to demonstrate that even a 

metamaterial  of  the  kind  that  is  often  called  left-handed  will  still  have  a  positive 

energy  and  avoid  the  possibility  that  a  negative  energy,  which  is  unacceptable 

physically,  might  appear  [4].  To  address  all  these  issues,  a  new  discussion  of  the 

energy density in metamaterials is presented here. It not only makes contact with the 

original work of Loudon [8], but also with a recent and exciting work in the field [7].  

Specifically,  Loudon  considered  dielectrics  with  Lorentz-type  of  dispersion, 

and this has been generalized to include a material in which both the permittivity and 

the  permeability  are  of  Lorentz-type  [5,  6].  The  closed-form  expressions  that  have 

emerged,  coupled  to  the  numerical  calculations,  show  that  the  energy  density  is 

always causal and always positive.  

Physically speaking, however, the arrays of split-ring resonators that provide 

the  negative  permeability  in  left-handed  media  (LHM)  cannot  be  considered  as  a 

Lorentz-type of medium [9, 10]. To move the axiomatic Lorentz restriction a recent 

approach  has  produced  a  new  expression  for  the  energy  density  for  such  arrays  [7]. 

This  progress  has  been  achieved,  however,  under  conditions  of  time-harmonic

excitation.  The  general  case,  using  electromagnetic  fields  with  arbitrary  time-

dependencies (e.g. short pulses) has not been considered yet; so this provision is one 

of the principle aims of the present study. The other one is to find a way of discussing 

the electromagnetic energy in LHM that is internally consistent, in the sense that it is 

robust with respect to low loss and high loss limits.  

 

In this paper Loudon approach [8] permits the derivation of an expression for 

the energy density in an LHM consisting of a split-ring resonator array [9, 10] and an 

array  of  wires  [3].  An  arbitrary  time-dependence  of  the  electromagnetic  field  is 

assumed. The energy density is then compared to the, previously reported [7], time-

harmonic electromagnetic field case and to the result for the energy density in Lorentz 

media [5-7]. It is shown that in a lossless, dispersive, material the result derived here 

reproduces the general formula for the electromagnetic energy density [11]. The new 

result  for  the  energy  density  associated  with  the  split-ring  resonator  array  is  used  in 

conjunction  with  FDTD  solutions  of  Maxwell’s  equations  to  show  that  energy 

conservation is satisfied to a high degree of accuracy. 

 

 

2. Electromagnetic energy density in a left-handed metamaterial 
 

The  artificial  molecules  that  make  up  a  metamaterial,  of  the  kind  that  have  been 

labeled  left-handed,  are  often  composed  of  split-rings  and  metal  wires.  The  latter 

provides the negative relative permittivity behavior while the former has the precise 

behavior  of  an  equivalent  LCR  circuit  under  the  restriction  that  the  radius  r   of  the 

ring is much less than the electromagnetic wavelength  λ. It is interesting that this is 

actually  a  very  old  problem  and  that  the  principal  result,  concerning  the 

electromagnetic  response  of  such  an  array,  was  published  many  years  ago  [9].  The 

recent popularity and applicability, however, has been driven by the work of Pendry. 

3

Provided  that  the  inequality 

λ<<r

  is  substantially  obeyed  the  treatment  of  the 

artificial molecule as an LCR circuit retains its validity. An actual metamaterial is a 

composite arrived at through a process of homogenization, however. To achieve this 

outcome,  a  split-ring  array  must  be,  initially,  thought  of  as  being  part  of  particular 

lattice. Hence, if it is assumed that the rings are on a lattice with cubic symmetry the 

final  outcome  is  an  isotropic  metamaterial.  For  simplicity,  this  is  the  symmetry 

assumed  here,  without  loss  of  generality.  A  composite  isotropic  metamaterial, 

consisting  of  an  array  of  split-ring  resonators  (SRR)  and  an  array  of  wires,  can  be 

precisely investigated with an equivalent LCR circuit. The final outcome is a relative 

scalar permeability  

and a relative scalar permittivity

pω   is  the  effective  plasma 

frequency, 

0ω  is the resonant frequency and ν and γ are the loss parameters. Note 

that  (2)  is  used  to  model  the  behavior  of  a  cold  electron  plasma.  Equation  (1) 

describes the response of an array of split-ring resonators to an external magnetic field 

[9, 10]. It is important to reemphasize that (1) can only be used provided that the ring 

radius  is  much  less  then  the  wavelength  and  this  fits  into  the  concept  of  a 

metamaterial  as  a  composite  of  artificial  subwavelength  “molecules”  [13].  The 

consequence of this assumption is that it permits the conduction current to dominate 

the displacement current. This physical situation is referred to in electromagnetics as a 

quasistatic  approximation  [11].  It  is  clear  that  (1)  does  not  provide  a  description  of

very high-frequency behavior because as 

∞→ω

 the permeability 

F−→ 1µ

, while 

it is 

1→µ  that should be expected physically. There is straightforward physical way 

to see this by recognizing that the concept of an inductor and capacitor break down at 

very high frequencies. It does not mean, however, that the expression (1) is wrong just 

because of this limitation on its frequency behavior. Indeed, it has been suggested [14-

18] that a Lorentz model,

is a suitable form for the relative permeability. Such a model, however, is axiomatic, 

since it is not proven by any microscopic considerations. At present the literature is 

populated  by  both  models  without  apparent  difficulty:  some  studies  [14-18]  use  (3) 

while others [7, 19, 20] use (1). This is easily explained by the fact that the frequency 

range that is interesting for applications maps onto the resonance region 

0ωω≈

 and 

this is precisely where both models have similar behavior. Away from the resonance 

the model described in (1) fails as 

∞→ω

 because it leads to a relative permeability 

of 

F−→ 1µ

.  On  the  other  hand  the  Lorentz  model  fails  as 

0→ω   leading  to  an 

incorrect  relative  permeability  of 

F+1

.  Indeed,  the  electromotive  force  driving  the 

current through the ring and producing the magnetic response of the ring tends to zero 

as 

0→ω .  Besides  that,  at  low  frequencies  the  capacitive  gap  of  the  split-ring 

resonator  prevents  any  current  from  flowing  and,  hence,  there  can  be  no  magnetic 

response  from  the  SRR  array.  This  means  that  the  limit 

1→µ   as 

0→ω   is  the 

correct one in full accordance with (1). Thus the asymptotic behavior away from the 

resonance does not make the model described in (1) incorrect and does not make the 

Lorentz model correct. Neither (3) nor (1) alone cover the entire range of frequencies 

from zero to infinity.

The electromagnetic energy density for a Lorentz-type of media (3) has been 

derived  earlier  [5-8].  The  corresponding  expression,  stemming  from  the  low-

frequency  model  (1)  derived  here  is  a  complementary  one,  since  its  validity  covers 

both the resonance region and the low-frequency region.

Hence,  at  this  stage  a  number  of  paths  can  be  taken.  The  most  recent  one 

involves an equivalent circuit (EC) approach [7] to calculating the energy. The latter 

yields  a  solution  that  does  not  demand  any  transformations  and  integrations  of  the 

type  that  will  be  done  below.  An  approach  involving  equivalent  circuits  is  not 

necessary, however, so Maxwell’s equations and their consequences can be processed 

directly.  By  adopting  this  strategy,  which  will  be  referred  to  here  as  the 

electrodynamic  (ED),  the  development  will  follow  the  path  highlighted  by  Loudon. 

One of the points of interest is to see whether there is both qualitative and quantitative 

agreement between the two approaches.

respectively,  where 

.   denotes  a  time-average.  Equation  (18)  is  the  time-averaged 

electric component of the energy. The latter is just a special case of the Lorentz-type 

of  dielectric  [5-8].  Equation  (19)  quantifies  the  ability  of  a  SRR  array,  with  a 

permeability function given by Eq. (1), to store magnetic energy. Thus it provides a 

measure of the response of the array. Note that 

Ew  and 

Mw  are strictly positive at 

all frequencies, regardless of the values of

from the EC approach [7]. Nevertheless, as will be shown below, the ED approach not 

only  has  this  property  but  it  leads  to  the  consistent  limit  in  a  dispersive  lossless 

material.  

 

If  the  losses  are  negligible,  the  time-averaged  energy  density,  for  a  quasi-

monochromatic (narrow-band) electromagnetic field, is [11]

3.0

. 

0ωω≈

,  as  it  should  be  expected.  The 

difference  between  the  two  becomes  evident  away  from  the  resonance  region.  As  it 

has been already pointed out in the low frequency region 

0ωω<

 preference should be 

given  to  (24)  since  the  Lorentz  model  (3)  does  not  have  the  correct  low-frequency 

limit.  On  the  other  hand  in  the  high-frequency  region, 

0ωω>

,  the  Lorentz 

permeability model, and its consequence Eq. (25) are expected to provide an adequate 

description. It has been pointed out [7] that the upper frequency limit above which the 

model (1) is no longer valid is the frequency at which the effective energy coefficient 

 

11

(24)  becomes  smaller  then  one.  Neglecting  the  losses,  (24)  yields 

03ωω<

.  The 

result  obtained  from  the  EC  approach,  (23)  indeed  gives 

eff =µ

1

  at 

0=ω ,  as  (23) 

and Fig. 1 show. Note, however, that even in the in the resonance region, where (24) 

and (25) are in agreement with each other, the difference between (24) and (25), on 

one  hand,  and  (23),  on  the  other,  is  significant  as  can  be  seen  by  examining  the 

logarithmic scale. As Fig. 1 (c) and (d) show the relative difference between the loss 

coefficients (27) and (28) (resulting from (1) and (3), respectively) is significant away 

from the resonance 

0ωω=

. 

 

As  pointed  out  earlier,  in  a  dispersive,  lossless  material  Eq.  (23)  is  not 

compatible with the magnetic part of (21) [7]. This has been attributed to the fact that 

(1)  is  valid  in  the  quasistatic  limit  only.  But,  as  shown  here,  the  expression  for  the 

magnetic energy density (19) and the magnetic part of (21) are in perfect agreement in 

a  dispersive,  lossless  material.  It  can  be  concluded,  therefore,  that  (19),  (or, 

equivalently, (24)), obtained with the ED-approach, are more internally consistent. 

4. Numerical results 
 

The validity of (14) and (15) can be checked by considering the system shown in Fig. 

2. It consists of a cylindrical Pendry-lens [3] and a wire dipole antenna. It has been 

shown recently [21] that a pair of dipole antennae, coupled by a “perfect” lens form 

an electromagnetic system that has a number of interesting properties.

The  distance  between  the  center  of  the  antenna  and  the  surface  of  the  disc  is 
2D . The voltage feeding the dipole is U(t).  
 

Fig.  2  shows  an  azimuthally  symmetric  arrangement  consisting  of  a  disc  made  of  a 

left-handed  metamaterial  placed  near  a  wire  dipole  antenna.  This  type  of  source  is 

very convenient because it allows a direct connection between the voltage applied at 

the  antenna  terminals  and  the  energy  stored  in  the  disc  to  be  established  easily. 

Assuming  that  the  voltage  is  switched  on  at  the  time  t=0,  integrating  (13)  over  the 

volume  V  of  the  disc  and  over  the  time  interval  [0,  t]  the  energy  conservation  law

time-domain  description  of  an  electromagnetic  field  propagating  in  a  dispersive  and 

lossy  LHM  with  the  permittivity  and  the  permeability  of  the  latter  given  by  (2)  and 

(1), respectively.  

 

Тhe results obtained from the solution of the set (34)-(38) are presented in Fig.

. As Fig 3 (a) shows, the energy conservation 

law  (29),  with  the  magnetic  part  of  the  stored  energy  calculated  from  Eq.  (15)  is 

satisfied to a high degree of accuracy, with the maximum relative error being less than 

3%.  Equation  (19)  is  in  an  excellent  agreement  with  the  time-averaged  version  of 

(15), as can be seen from Fig. 3 (b). This is because the electromagnetic field is, in 

fact,  monochromatic.  Expression  (23),  resulting  from  the  EC-approach  in  this  case 

overestimates the magnetic part of the stored energy by 50%, as Fig. 3(b) shows. The 

dynamics of the stored energy, presented in Fig. 2, show that while the amplitude of 

the  feeding  voltage  reaches  a  stationary  state  for  about  10  periods  of  the  carrier 

frequency, the duration of the relaxation period for the stored energy is more than 60 

periods. This feature is related to the finite size of the lens and depends on the losses 

[24]. Therefore, the formation of a stationary electromagnetic field distribution inside 

the lens and, consequently, the formation of the image (Fig. 3b) can be regarded as a 

“slow” process.

.  The  overlap  between  the  pulse  spectrum  Fig  4(c)  and  resonant 

curve shown in Fig. 1(a) is strong in this case. As in Fig. 3(a), the energy conservation 

law  is  satisfied  again  to  a  high  degree  of  accuracy.  The  corresponding  electric  and 

magnetic  energies  are  shown  in  Fig.  4(b).  The  magnitude  of  the  magnetic  stored 

energy is larger than the magnitude of the electric energy, which is consistent with the 

resonant structure of

5. Conclusions  
 

Expressions  for  the  energy  density  and  energy  losses  in  a  dispersive  and  lossy  left-

handed  metamaterial,  consisting  of  an  array  of  wires  and  an  array  of  SRRs  are 

derived.  An  electromagnetic  field  with  arbitrary  time-dependence  is  considered. 

Under  conditions  of  negligible  losses,  the  result  for  the  magnetic  part  of  the  energy 

(the  energy  stored  in  the  SRR  array)  obtained  here  is  in  full  agreement  with  the 

general formula, valid for a lossless dispersive material. In the resonance region, the 

new result for the magnetic part of the stored electromagnetic energy is shown to map 

quantitatively  onto  the  result  obtained  from  the  Lorentz  permeability  model.  The 

power-loss  terms,  resulting  from  the  two  permeability  models  considered,  however, 

quickly  diverge  away  from  the  resonance.  Exact  FDTD-solutions  of  Maxwell’s 

equations  show  that  the  energy  conservation  law  is  satisfied  to  a  high  degree  of 

accuracy, thus validating the analytical results obtained.

Abstract 
 

The inverse square force law admits a conserved vector that lies in the plane of motion. 

This vector has been associated with the names of Laplace, Runge, and Lenz, among others. 

Many workers have explored aspects of the symmetry and degeneracy associated with this vector 

and with analogous dynamical symmetries. We define a conserved dynamical variable α that 

characterizes the orientation of the orbit in two-dimensional configuration space for the Kepler 

problem and an analogous variable β for the isotropic harmonic oscillator. This orbit orientation 

variable is canonically conjugate to the angular momentum component normal to the plane of 

motion. We explore the canonical one-parameter group of transformations generated by α (β). 

Because we have an obvious pair of conserved canonically conjugate variables, it is desirable to 

use them as a coordinate-mometum pair. In terms of these phase space coordinates, the form of 

the Hamiltonian is nearly trivial because neither member of the pair can occur explicitly in the 

Hamiltonian. From these considerations we gain a simple picture of dynamics in phase space. 

The procedure we use is in the spirit of the Hamilton-Jacobi method.

 

 

I. The Kepler Problem 

There are hundreds of papers1-10 on the power, applications, and extensions of the 

Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. The paper by Mukunda11 comes closest to what we discuss below, 

but our aim is primarily pedagogical. 

Students in intermediate mechanics courses are usually taught that there is a deep 

connection between symmetries, degeneracy, and conservation laws. A student impressed by this 

insight might wonder what symmetry, if any, is connected with the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. 

We have not found an answer in the literature that is accessible to advanced undergraduates. To 

be sure, there are discussions of the dynamical O(4) and SU(3) symmetries of the Kepler and 

harmonic oscillator problems respectively. For instance, O(4) has six generators, of which three 

are the components of angular momentum and generate ordinary rotations, and three are related 

to the components of the Runge-Lenz vector. However, students are not likely to have the 

background to appreciate the insights provided by this approach. 

Although the symmetries of space and time (the kinematic symmetries) imply important 

conservation laws such as those of energy, momentum, and angular momentum, there are other 

conserved quantities that follow from symmetries in phase space. Dynamical symmetries are 

precisely the extra symmetries realized in phase space, and the Hamiltonian formulation of 

dynamics is most conducive for their investigation. There are excellent general textbooks12, 13 

that offer ways of exploring Hamiltonian flows in phase space and their associated symmetries, 

but these approaches also may not be accessible at the intermediate mechanics level. In this 

paper, we take advantage of the fact that students are familiar with the ordinary dynamics of the 

Kepler problem and the isotropic harmonic oscillator to motivate the consideration of 

symmetries in the simple phase spaces of these systems. Although we cite the literature for more

advanced or general treatments, we hope that the following discussion will be self-contained and 

introduce the reader to the central and powerful idea of dynamics. 

This brief introduction will serve mainly to explain our notation. Let a particle of mass m 

be subject to an inverse square central force 

; if k > 0, the force is attractive. and if k < 0, it is 

repulsive. It is not difficult to verify that  

 

 

is a constant of the motion, where

are the momentum, angular momentum, and radial unit 

vectors, respectively.  Moreover, 

 is in the plane of the motion, and its magnitude is the 

eccentricity of the conic section that is the orbit, and hence

 is determined by the energy and 

(cid:71)
A

the angular momentum. Thus, given the conservation of energy and angular momentum, the 

conservation of 

 amounts to the additional information that its direction in the plane of motion 

(cid:71)
A

is a constant of the motion and points from the center of force to the pericenter of the orbit in the 

attractive case. 

 

The conservation of the angular momentum vector restricts the motion to a plane, the x-y 

plane, and hence there is no loss if we consider the two-dimensional problem from the start. In 

this case, we may conveniently regard the conservation of angular momentum to be simply the 

conservation of what would have been its z-component in the three-dimensional problem,

Because the components are each constants of the motion, so is the angle between the vector and

In an obvious manner, α specifies the orientation of the orbit. We have explicitly indicated the 

four phase space variables as the arguments of α to emphasize that α is a dynamical variable and 

hence is a function of the state of the system just as L is. 

An explicit, though rather tedious calculation establishes the following Poisson bracket: 

The Poisson brackets with the Hamiltonian can be established either through an explicit

Thus not only can we make a canonical transformation to a new set of coordinates in phase space 

with α and L as a pair of canonically conjugate variables, but if we do, both members of this pair 

are conserved. This fact is what is special about the variable α. A number of angle variables, 

such as θ = tan-1(y/x), have the right Poisson bracket with L to constitute potentially a 

canonically conjugate pair, but in general, they would not also be conserved. 

Suppose in addition to L and α, Q and P are a second pair of conjugate variables after the 

canonical transformation. Then the Hamiltonian can be written as a function of the new phase

On the other hand, {L , Q} = {α, Q} = {L , P} = {α, P} = 0. An obvious choice that meets all

The general scheme outlined here is well known in classical mechanics: for a system with 

n degrees of freedom and a time independent Lagrangian, we can find (2n-1) time-independent 

constants of motion as the coordinates of phase space. The remaining coordinate will turn out to 

be proportional to time. One typically sees this general development in the context of the 

Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We have discussed an example of the general result in a non-trivial 

context that can be usefully introduced in intermediate mechanics courses.  

Next we try to understand the role of α as the infinitesimal generator of a one-parameter 

subgroup (of canonical transformations) in phase space. The general principles are well known: 

Just as L generates rotations in the x-y plane (to be illustrated explicitly below), and just as the 

variables:

Hamiltonian generates time evolution, then for any dynamical variable G(x, y, px, py), we can 

find the one-parameter group of transformations generated by it in phase space (at least locally).  

There is an informal way to understand the nature of a one-parameter group of 

transformations in phase space. Choose a state of the system, a point in phase space, as the 

starting point. There is a curve in phase space through this point on which the value of the 

dynamical variable, G, is a constant, but its canonically conjugate dynamical variable,  G , 

changes its value from point to point. We can use the change in the value of  G , call it 

ε

, to label 

the points on the curve. The transformations generated by G take us from state to state along 

such a curve. We also can determine the change in any dynamical variable under the 

transformations generated by G.  

We summarize the method for carrying out these calculations, citing references for 

details.12, 13 Let ε be the parameter, with  ε = 0 corresponding to the starting point in phase space; 

ε has physical dimensions of Action/G. Let F be any dynamical phase space variable; in 

particular, the analysis applies to canonical coordinates and momenta.

and similarly for the momenta. The reader might recognize that Eq. (12b) cooresponds to 

ordinary rotations in the x-y plane, the rotation angle serves as the parameter as claimed earlier. 

Similar equations can be found for other pairs of canonical variables. Upon integration 

with respect to ε, with the given initial values at ε = 0, we obtain the finite changes in the 

dynamical variables. We consider transformations generated by α. Numerical integration of the 

equations for the old coordinates and momenta is used to compute the transformation of phase 

space points. Because the phase space, even for this simple system is four-dimensional, it is 

better to use a reduced phase space such as the x-y plane or a three dimensional space whose 

axes are r, px, and py for computer generated pictures of how a point in phase space moves under 

these transformations. Simpler than the effect of canonical transformations generated by α on the 

old coordinates and momenta, are their effect on the Hamiltonian and the angular momentum. 

Because the Poisson bracket of H with α vanishes, H is invariant under these transformations as 

we would expect. Also, {α, L} = 1 implies that L(ε) = L(0) + ε; so the transformations induce 

7 

7 

 

 

 

“translations” in the conjugate angular momentum variable, again as we would expect. 

Physically, the energy is unchanged, but the angular momentum varies continuously between –

Lmax and +Lmax. In global terms, an elliptical orbit is transformed into another with the same 

major axis, but a different eccentricity, while preserving the direction of the major axis in space. 

The changes thus produced can be animated and are available for download.14 Interested readers 

can think of several additional computer graphics projects along similar lines to help them 

consolidate these fundamental ideas of classical dynamics. 

II. 

The Harmonic Oscillator 

For the isotropic two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, we also have elliptical orbits, and a given 

energy (proportional to the sum of the squares of the major and minor axes) corresponds to a 

range of angular momentum values, or alternatively, eccentricities. In this case, however, the 

center of force is at the geometric center of the ellipse. Hence, we do not expect an extra 

conserved vector to represent properly the dynamical symmetry of the oscillator. (Which way 

could such a vector point? Either of the two opposite directions along the major axis would be 

equivalent.) The object that best captures the degeneracy arising from the dynamical symmetry is 

a symmetric second rank tensor.10 For convenience, let us choose units so that the mass, m = 1, 

and the spring constant, k = 1. We will denote the tensor (defined below) by A and write it in 

matrix form. Let the Cartesian coordinates be xi and the corresponding momentum components 

be pi. It is not difficult to check that  

 

A
ij

(

x x

are conserved in this system. For two degrees of freedom, there are three independent 

components: A11, A22, and A12 = As1. However, the trace of the tensor A is the Hamiltonian, and 

8 

(13) 

8 

 

 

 

the determinant of the tensor is (

2 / 4L

). Hence, as is to be expected, given the conservation of 

energy and angular momentum, there is only one more independent conserved quantity that the 

tensor A represents.  

We digress for a moment to make a counting argument for central forces in n-

dimensional space. The number of components of angular momentum  (

L
ij

=

x p
i

j

−

x p
j
i

)

in n-

dimensions is n(n - 1)/2. The maximum number of independent (and time-independent) 

conserved functions in phase space is (2n - 1). Thus the search for dynamically conserved 

quantities besides the angular momentum components and energy is interesting only in two and 

three dimensions. Quite apart from the practical interest in two and three dimensions, physical 

considerations of the evolution of the system point in phase space also pick out these low 

dimensional problems as special. Of course, we do not mean to discount the purely theoretical 

value of investigating the more general cases. Moreover, as remarked earlier, because we 

understand the implications of the conservation of angular momentum in classical dynamics, 

there is no loss of generality in reducing the three-dimensional problem to the two dimensions of 

the plane of motion. 

 

 Returning now to the two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, we can again 

construct a single dynamical variable that represents the orientation of the elliptical orbit in the 

plane of motion, which we characterize as either the x-y plane or equivalently the x1-x2 plane. To 

see in detail how this construction can be done, note that each of the components of A is 

conserved, and hence it may be evaluated at any point in the orbit. Consider an elliptical orbit as 

shown in Fig. 1 whose major axis makes an angle β with the positive x1 axis; the natural range of

where a and b are respectively the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse; we have

 Of course, β is a constant of the motion, because it is expressed as a function only of the other 

constants of the motion. As such it has a vanishing Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian. A 

straightforward calculation shows that {

Lβ

 As in Sec. I, the effect of the transformation 

generated by β is to produce local translations in L while leaving the energy invariant. In 

configuration space, these transformations take one elliptical orbit to another with the same 

orientation, the same value of the sum of the squares of the major and minor axes, but with a 

different ratio between the axes. All the other developments are analogous to the case of the 

inverse-square-force problem. The reader can play with computer graphics to better understand

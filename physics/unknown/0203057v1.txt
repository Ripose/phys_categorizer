Abstract

In  conditions  where  the  interaction  betweeen  an  atom  and  a  short  high-frequency  (X-UV)

laser pulse is a perturbation, we show that a simple theoretical approach, based on Coulomb-

Volkov-type states, can make reliable predictions for ionization. For any field parameter, the

method  provides  accurate  energy  spectra  of  ejected  electrons,  including  many  Above

Threshold Ionization (ATI) peaks, as long as the two following conditions are simultaneously

fulfilled : (i) the photon energy is greater than or equal to the ionization potential ; (ii) the total

ionization  probability  does  not  exceed  20%.  Thus,  ionization  of  atoms  or  molecules  by  the

high-harmonics  laser  pulses  which  are  generated  at  present  may  be  addressed  through  this

Coulomb-Volkov treatment.

I. Introduction

In the last months, low intensity X-UV laser pulses of a few hundreds of attoseconds

have  been  produced  by  harmonics  generation  techniques  [1].  Such  pulses  are  promising

powerful tools to investigate thoroughly the dynamics of  various elementary processes (e.g.,

electronic evolution of microscopic systems). Further, the energy of high-harmonic photons is

often  high  enough  to  ionize  atomic  or  molecular  systems  with  the  absorption  of  a  single

photon. It is at variance  with  infrared  laser  pulses,  where both a simultaneous absorption of

many photons and a high laser intensity are required to achieve ionization with a reasonable

probability. Furthermore, with very short X-UV laser pulses, the ionization of a microscopic

system takes place in a time interval much shorter than any relaxation period of  the system.

Untill now, most  theoretical approaches of ionization were made  in a  context of  both  much

longer pulse durations and much lower photon energies. Indeed, full numerical treatments of

the  time  dependent  Schrödinger  equation  are  powerful  ways  to  investigate  the  ionization  of

one or two-electron systems by subfemtosecond X-UV laser pulses. However, running them

involves  intensive  calculations  [2].  Therefore,  the  studies  of  future  experiments  call  for

adapted theoretical approximations that could provide easy reliable predictions of ionization

by short X-UV laser pulses. In this new context, we examine an approach that was introduced

in the seventies [3]. A code implementing a full 3D numerical approach, hereafter referred to

as TDSE [2], is used to indicate the domain where this approximation is applicable.

In  previous  papers  [4-6],  we  introduced  a  non-perturbative  approach  of  atom

ionization by ultra-short electromagnetic pulses. It was based on Coulomb-Volkov (CV) states

[3],  which  are  used  in  the  framework  of  the  sudden  approximation.  Compared  to  TDSE

calculations,  this  approach,  hereafter  referred  to  as  CV1,  appears  to  be  a  very  simple  but

powerful tool to study ionization by an external electric field, no matter what the strength of

the perturbation is, when three conditions are simultaneously fulfilled : (i) the pulse duration

is smaller than or comparable to the initial orbital period of the electron, (ii) all this time the

electric field does not perform  more than two  oscillations,  and (iii) its  net integral  over  this

time is not zero (DC component of the electric field that shows here mainly a classical aspect).

This  regime  may  be  called  a  collisional  regime  because  the  electromagnetic  pulse  presents

similarities to the perturbation produced by a fast impinging ion. CV1 predictions are shown

to be all the better that the electric field amplitude is high, the initial quantum number is large

and  the  pulse  duration  is  short.  Thus,  it  should  be  well  adapted  to  study  the  ionization  by

3

impact of swift ions, more especially by fast multicharged ions. Although CV1 cannot be used

to make predictions with genuine laser pulses (for which the DC electric field component is

zero),  the  previous  studies  indicate  that,  during  a  short  enough  time,  the  exact  state  of  the

interacting system is well described by CV wavefunctions.

High-harmonics subfemtosecond pulses fit in with a quite different context. They are

very short and  their  intensity is  quite  small    (see  e.g.,  ref.  [1]).  Thus,  investigations  may  be

restricted to conditions where the laser field is a perturbation. Further, a pulse always contains

enough  field  oscillations  to  appear  as  a  photon  field,  whose  spectrum  may  be  quite  broad,

depending upon the pulse length. Now, the field exhibits mainly its quantum aspect. With a

photon energy high enough to ionize the atom, an ejected electron is rapidly towed away from

the nucleus. Therefore, the influence of the latter on the dynamics of the ionization process is

likely  to  be  negligible.  Thus,  a  Coulomb-Volkov  approach  restricted  to  perturbation

conditions  may  be  imagined  since  a  Coulomb-Volkov  state  is  a  good  description  of  the

interacting  system  as  long  as  the  abovementioned  dynamical  influence  is  small  [6].  The

interest of this type of approach comes from the fact that the Coulomb-Volkov phase offers all

possibilities of simultaneous exchange of many photons. In addition, the Coulomb influence

of the nucleus before and after interaction is kept, thus preserving the asymptotic behaviours.

A similar approach has already been introduced a long time ago by Jain and Tzoar [3].  The

method was  examined  in  various  situations  (stationary  laser  beams,  low  frequency  photons)

which  differ  completely  from  the  physical  conditions  of  ultra-short  X-UV  laser  pulses  (see,

e.g.,  [7,8]  and  references  therein).  In  the  present  paper,  we  investigate  to  which  extent  a

similar perturbation Coulomb-Volkov approach may be employed to predict single ionization

of atoms or molecules by high-frequency photons of a short laser pulse. It is worth noting that

our study does not include backscattering, thus excluding all further processes such as higher

harmonics emission or high-energy ATI.

In section II, the perturbative Coulomb-Volkov theory of ionization, hereafter referred

to as CV2-, is briefly described in the context of short X-UV laser pulses. In section III, it is

applied in conditions that can be achieved actually with present-day high-harmonics radiation.

CV2- energy spectra of electrons ejected from hydrogen atoms initially in their ground state

are compared to TDSE predictions. Conclusions are drawn in section IV.

Atomic units are used throughout unless otherwise stated.

To  determine  under  which  conditions  CV2-  applies,  we  address  here  the  ionization  of
hydrogen atoms in their  ground  state  by  high-frequency  laser  pulses.  As  already  mentioned,
 (15th harmonics in ref. [1] ) in
the study is first carried out with a photon energy

shortcoming  of  the  CV2-  method  itself,  but  to  rounding-off  numbers  in  the  numerical  time
integration.  For  the  background,  the  contribution  of  a  given  half-cycle  is  both,  very  small
compared  to  the  value  at  a  peak  and  very  close  to  the  opposite  of  the  contribution  of  the
subsequent half-cycle. Thus, the final value seems mainly connected to the order of magnitude
of the last significant digit.

free  electron  under  the  influence  of  the  laser  electric  field  during  the  pulse.  In  the  case

,  the  ejected  electron  is  "free  to  move  immediately"  in  the  continuum  after  the
absorption of any number of photons. However, two or more photons are necessary to reach

time delay before the electron can move. Therefore, CV2- anticipates the displacement that is
equivalent to anticipating ionization. As a result, ionization is overestimated. An other cause
of  disagreement  comes  from  the  fact  that  CV2-  does  not  account  for  intermediate  Rydberg
resonances when

Therefore,  the  present  form  of  CV2-  provides  reliable  data  only  when  the  photon

D.  Application in the collisional regime

In  all  cases  that  have  been  examined  in  previous  paragraphs,  the  electric  field  of  the  laser
performs  about  3  oscillations  or  more,  thus  placing  the  transition  in  the  "photonic  regime".
Although  there  is  nothing  indicating  that  CV2-  could  fail  in  the  "collisional  regime"  (where
the  electromagnetic  field  performs  less  than  2  oscillations),  it  is  worth  checking  that  good
predictions  can  still  be  obtained.  To  do  that,  we  kept  the  first  term  in  the  r.h.s.  of  Eq.  (22)
  in  this  case.  On  Fig.  5,  electron  spectra  are  reported  for
since  one  has  generally

IV. Conclusions and perspectives

Atom ionization by short VUV laser pulses may be described accurately by the first order of a
perturbation  approach  based  on  Coulomb-Volkov  states.  The  latter,  that  we  called  CV2-,
consists  in  replacing,  in  the  prior  form  of  the  transition  amplitude,  the  total  exact
wavefunction connected to the final continuum state by the corresponding Coulomb-Volkov
wavefunction. We have shown that very good predictions of ATI spectra are obtained when
the photon energy is greater than or equal to the ionization potential of the target and when
perturbation conditions prevail. In fact, the total ionization probability should not exceed 20%.
Therefore, CV2- allows to study the ionization of atoms or molecules by the high-harmonics
laser pulses which are now generated.

The present study is the first extended test of CV2- with subfemtosecond VUV laser pulses.
Some  defects  showed  up  in  the  calculation  of  the  spectrum  background.  Hence,  we  plan  to
improve the time integration procedure in order to extend the domain where the method CV2-
applies.

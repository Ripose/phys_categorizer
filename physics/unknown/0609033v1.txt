1. Introduction

The notion of light containing orbital and spin components of angular momentum has become of
interest in recent years and a direct decomposition into the two components has been found for
paraxial rays [1-4]. However, a simple, plausible and general derivation of the components from
the expression for the angular momentum J(t) of the classical electromagnetic field in terms of
the electric E(x,t) and magnetic field B(x,t)

(Gaussian units, bold font denotes a three-vector) seems to be lacking. Some authors [5, 6], used
decompositions  that  were  not  manifestly  gauge  invariant.  Other  decompositions  lack  generality
[2, 3, 7]. In this paper, by applying the vector decomposition theorem of Helmholtz to the electric
field, we obtain a decomposition of the angular momentum of the classical electromagnetic field
into  orbital  and  spin  components  that  is  explicit,  quite  general  and  manifestly  gauge  invariant
throughout because it involves the fields only and not the potentials.

2. Helmholtz decompositions

The  vector  decomposition  theorem  of  Helmholtz  [8-11]  states  that  any  3-vector  field  E(x)  that
vanishes at spatial infinity can be expressed uniquely as the sum of two terms

E(x,t) = -(cid:209)

x f (x,t) + (cid:209)

· F(x,t)

where  (cid:209)
functions are

x  is  the  gradient  operator  with  respect  to  x  and  the  scalar  f  and  vector  F  potential

and 

F(x,t) = d 3y

The first term of (2) is called the longitudinal part, the second the transverse part. Some authors
have  questioned  if  the  Helmholtz  theorem  applies  to  fields  that  vary  with  time  and  it  has  been
confirmed  elsewhere  [10-12]  that  it  does.  If  the  field  is  the  electromagnetic  E  field  then,  after
using Maxwell equations, the two potential functions in (2) become

was  obtained  previously  [10,  11]  by  making  a  Helmholtz  decomposition  of  the  general
electromagnetic  vector  potential.  The  term  At  is  the  irreducible  part  of  the  vector  potential  that
encodes  all  the  information  about  the  magnetic  field  [11].  The  pure  gauge  term  of  the  vector
potential, which is the gradient of a scalar field, does not encode any physical information. When
the electromagnetic E field is decomposed in this way one part of it, that involving the gradient in
equation (2), is necessarily associated with the presence of electric charge (bound or b) and one
part,  that  involving  the  curl  in  equation  (2)  (free  or  f),  is  not  necessarily  associated  with  the
presence of electric charge. In this sense, the fields in an irregularly shaped metal cavity will be
said to be free although they do not have the form of plane waves. The categorisation applies to
any physical quantities that depend on E, such as the angular momentum.

As  well,  the  electromagnetic  B  field  may  be  decomposed  by  means  of  the  Helmholtz
.B = 0, there is only one term in the decomposition and, with the use of the

theorem. Because (cid:209)

The  first  term  is  an  instantaneous  Biot-Savart  term,  the  second  term  accounts  for  time
dependence  of  the  fields.  These  Helmholtz  decompositions  all  have  the  feature  that  they  are
formally instantaneous in time.

3. Angular momentum of the classical electromagnetic field

To  calculate  the  angular  momentum  of  the  classical  electromagnetic  field  we  decompose  the
electric field according to (2) and (4) and put the result into (1).

The contribution of the free field is given by the term in (2) that contains the vector potential field
F. With the use of a standard vector identity we expand the vector product as

Equation  (14)  and  (16)  demonstrate  the  decomposition  of  the  angular  momentum  into  the  two
components.

We  have  obtained  a  decomposition  of  the  angular  momentum  of  the  classical  electromagnetic
field into orbital and spin components that is general and manifestly gauge invariant. This is done
by  decomposing  the  electric  field  into  its  longitudinal  and  transverse  parts  by  means  of  the
Helmholtz theorem. The orbital and spin components of the angular momentum of any specified
electromagnetic  field  can  be  found  from  this  prescription.  Applications  to  specific  field
configurations are made elsewhere [13-17].

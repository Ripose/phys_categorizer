Using only a thought experiment and Einstein’s correspondence principal, a model is derived that 
correctly predicts the Schwarzschild time dilation expression in limiting cases.  The method requires 
almost no prerequisite knowledge from the student and is carried out with only algebraic techniques, 
allowing the introduction of a mathematical example of general relativity to introductory physics students.

Introduction 
There has recently been a push in the literature1 and 
in  textbooks2  to  integrate  the  concepts  of  general 
relativity 
of 
undergraduate  physics  students.    Such  a  push  is 
certainly understandable considering the current state 
of  theoretical  physics  of  which  “general  relativity 
(GR)  has  become  an  integral  and  indispensable 
part.”3    It  is  somewhat,  unfortunate,  therefore,  that 
the 
introductory 
undergraduate  and  high  school  level  are  rarely,  if 
ever,  presented  with  a  mathematically  motivated 
discussion of general relativity.  
 
 
Opposition 
is  certainly 
appropriate.    Attempting  to  make  any  progress,  in  a 
mathematical 
level 
appropriate  to  introductory  students  is  difficult,  but 
not  impossible,  if  we  motivate  the  discussion  by 
attempting 
than 
describe physical fact.  In the derivation that follows, 
we will attempt to extend a general conceptual model 
of General Relativity into the realm of mathematical 
formalism.4 
 
 
It  is  important  to  stress  that  what  follows  is  an 
‘intuitive’  approximation  of  general  relativity;  yet, 
what  the  model  lacks  in  precision;  it  gains  back  in 
approachability.    Prior  to  attempting  this  “general 
relativistic”  problem,  it  would  benefit  the  student 
immensely  to  see  the  derivation  of  time  dilation  in 
special  relativity.5    The  derivation,  herein  given,  is 
implicitly  based  on  the  model  of  special  relativistic 
time dilation.  Also, it would be beneficial to give a 
conceptual  explanation  of 
the  correspondence 
principle6 as the reference frame of this derivation is 
the ubiquitous accelerating gedanke spaceship. 
 
 
Method 
Imagine  that  we  are  floating  in  an  interstellar 
spaceship,  far  away  from  any  source  of  gravity.  
Also,  we  have  just  spoken  to  the  captain,  and  he 
assures us that the ship is in an inertial frame, that is 
to say, all the force sensors onboard indicate there is 
no acceleration of any kind influencing the ship.  We 
are very pleased by this because we want to conduct 
an experiment to determine how much time it takes a 
beam of light to go from the floor of the ship to the 
ceiling, a height

Being good theoreticians, we decide to work out how long 
it should take the beam of light to reach the ceiling with no

We  are  ready  to  get  underway  to  conduct  the  experiment 
when  we  get  a  message  from  the  captain  of  the  ship.    He 
sends  his  apologies,  but  says  we  just  received  a  distress 
signal  and  have  to  begin  accelerating  at  a  constant

Undeterred,  we  decide  simply  to  redo  the  calculation  for 
(1a) in an accelerating reference frame. 
 
 
Thus,  we  need  to  find  an  equation  that  will  relate  how 
much time it will take the light to reach the ceiling, in the 
presence  of  a  constant  acceleration.    This  is  a  little  bit 
tricky to conceive conceptually, but let’s change the model 
from a spaceship to standing on the earth in the presence of 
a  gravitational  force.    Also,  instead  of  shooting  light 
upwards,  let’s  throw  a  ball  upwards  and  ask,  in  the 
presence  of  gravity,  how  long  does  it  take  the  ball  to 
go y∆ ?  We can make this ‘conceptual’ change because of 
the  Einstein  equivalence  principal.    Now  we  can  conceive 
very easily that the form of the equation we need is just one 
of the standard kinematics equations:

We chose this particular solution of the quadratic because it 
on the upward 
refers to the “first” time the ball reaches
part  of  its  journey.    Next,  we  transition  back  to  the 
spaceship, where the ball we are “throwing” corresponds to 
light, so

The time interval for the accelerated frame is longer.  
Surely,  this  is  a  mistake?    We  can  conceive  that  it 
makes sense in the case of the spaceship, because the 
“ceiling”  of  the  spaceship  moves  upward,  thus 
making the light travel a longer distance.  But, if the 
Einstein correspondence principle is correct, then this 
suggests  that  in  the  presence  of  gravity,  time  is  also 
dilated!  Incredulous, we go back to the computer and 
graph equation (1) and equation (2) with the relevant 
numerical constants.

It  seems  like  at  every  point,  save  zero,  the  linear 
curve  for  the  inertial  model  is  greater  than  the 
quadratic  curve  for  the  accelerated  model.    To  be

The bottom curve is the accelerated model. 
 
Incredibly,  in  the  accelerated  frame,  or  by  the 
correspondence principal, the gravitationally affected 
frame, the time interval is longer.  Time runs slower 
in  the  presence  of  gravity!    Excited,  we  tell  the 
captain  and  he  asks  us  to  try  to  relate  the  one  time 
interval to the other.

Equation  (7)  represents  the  gravitational  time  dilation  of

Comparison to Exact Solution 
We might ask ourselves how our model compares to actual 
theoretical  results  from  GR.    To  do  so  we  introduce  a 
the  Einstein  equations  for  a  spherically 
solution 
symmetric  mass,  such  as  the  Earth,  known  as  the 
Schwarzschild solution.9

Furthermore,  we  can  rewrite  equation  (9)  in  terms  of  the 
variables that we were using, corresponding to acceleration 
caused  by  gravity.    To  do  so  is  a  good  exercise  for  the 
student.    Also,  we  will  make  the  change  of  variable, 
r → .  We can do this because y is simply one specific 
direction of a radial path.

The  correspondence  between  equation  (7)  and 
equation  (9a)  is  really  quite  amazing.    True,  we  had 
to  use  some  mathematical  ‘trickery’  to  get  the 
equations 
the 
mathematical  form  of  the  equations  is  precisely  the 
same  (save  a  nonessential  delta  and  an  inequality 
sign).    This  suggests,  at  the  very  least,  that  the 
assumptions that we made in our derivation were not 
at  all  baseless,  and  that  GR  really  does  behave  in  a 
way consistent with our assumptions.  Below, we will 
think 
and 
approximations that we made.

At  equation  (6)  we  noted  that 

.    Why?  

The  point  is  actually  very  important  and  very 
revealing.  We used as our fundamental model for an 
accelerated frame equation (2).  However, there was a 
subtle Newtonian assumption in equation (2) that we 
have  not  discussed  until  now—the  concept  of 
constant acceleration.  Imagine that we accelerated a 

rocket  constantly  at 

5.4

.    If  acceleration 

=t

were  constant,  at 
s,  we  would 
achieve the speed of light!  A nanosecond thereafter 
we  would  surpass  the  speed  of  light.    This  is  not 
allowed.    Relativistically,  there  is  no  such  thing  as 
constant  acceleration.    Yet,  this  is  what  we  used  as 
our  model.    Thus,  to  prevent  unwanted  relativistic 
side  effects  of  non-constant  acceleration,  we  must 
only concern ourselves when the speed of our rocket 
is  well  below  the  speed  of  light,  thus,  very  short 
times.    Determining  how  short  “very  short”  is  takes 
some foresight, but can be determined as follows. 
 
Recall 

the 
.10    If  ar becomes  incredibly 
large,  then  we  get  an  imaginary  result,  which, 
physically, corresponds to the fact that the light beam 
never  hits  the  ceiling,  because  the  spaceship  is  now 
traveling  faster  than  a  light  beam.    We  know  this 
cannot  be  true  because  the  space  ship  CANNOT  go 
faster than the speed of light equation (9); therefore:

Discussion 
Using  just  the  precept  of  a  thought  experiment  and  the 
notion of Einsteinian correspondence, we have determined 
a simple, but effective, model to explain gravitational time 
dilation.  Einstein would have been proud!  Not only do the 
results  make  conceptual  sense,  but  in  the  limit,  they 
become the solution of the exact Schwarzschild spacetime.  
What is more, we developed all of the concepts with very 
simple  algebra,  at  a  mathematical  level  appropriate  to 
introductory  college  students  and  advanced  high  school 
students.    If  the  instructor  wished  to  extend  the  results 
herein  presented  she  could  certainly  consider  the  situation 
in terms of the relativistic acceleration function.11   Such a 
demand  much  more 
derivation  would 
mathematical  sophistication12  from  the  student,  but  would 
require  far  fewer  assumptions,  and  may,  in  that  respect, 
actually be clearer to a mathematically prepared student.

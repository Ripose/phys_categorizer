Abstract 

 
 
 
A mathematical model is presented for predicting magnetic targeting of multifunctional 
carrier particles that are designed to deliver therapeutic agents to malignant tissue in vivo. 
These particles consist of a nonmagnetic core material that contains embedded magnetic 
nanoparticles  and  therapeutic  agents  such  as  photodynamic  sensitizers.  For  in  vivo 
therapy,  the  particles  are  injected  into  the  vascular  system  upstream  from  malignant 
tissue,  and  captured  at  the  tumor  using  an  applied  magnetic  field.  The  applied  field 
couples to the magnetic nanoparticles inside the carrier particle and produces a force that 
attracts the particle to the tumor. In noninvasive therapy the applied field is produced by a 
permanent  magnet  positioned  outside  the  body.  In  this  paper  a  mathematical  model  is 
developed for predicting noninvasive magnetic targeting of therapeutic carrier particles in 
the  microvasculature.  The  model  takes  into  account  the  dominant  magnetic  and  fluidic 
forces on the particles and leads to an analytical expression for predicting their trajectory. 
An analytical expression is also derived for predicting the volume fraction of embedded 
magnetic nanoparticles required to ensure capture of the carrier particle at the tumor. The 
model  enables  rapid  parametric  analysis  of  magnetic  targeting  as  a  function  of  key 
variables including the size of the carrier particle, the properties and volume fraction of  
the embedded magnetic nanoparticles, the properties of the magnet, the microvessel, the 
hematocrit of the blood and its flow rate.

1. Introduction 
 

Magnetic  targeting  of  malignant  tissue  using  multifunctional  carrier  particles  has  the 
potential to provide more effective anticancer treatment by enabling a variety of localized 
treatment  and  diagnostic  modalities,  while  at  the  same  time  reducing  undesired  side 
effects. The interest in this therapy is growing due to recent progress in the development 
of carrier particles that are designed to target a specific tissue, and effect local chemo-, 
radio-  and  genetherapy  at  a  tumor  site  [1-4].  In  this  paper  we  study  in  vivo  magnetic 
targeting  of  carrier  particles  that  consist  of  a  nonmagnetic  core  material,  such  as 
polyarcylamide  (PAA),  with  embedded  magnetic  nanoparticles  and  therapeutic  agents 
such  as  photodynamic  sensitizers  (Fig.  1).  Polyethylene  glycol  (PEG)  and  biotargeting 
agents can be coated onto the surface of the carrier particle to control plasma residence 
time and to promote binding to target tissue, respectively [5]. The magnetic nanoparticles 
embedded in the carrier particle enable multiple distinct therapeutic functions including 
magnetic  targeting,  RF  hyperthermia  and  MRI  contrast  enhancement.  Multifunctional 
carrier particles containing magnetic nanoparticles and a photosensitizer have proven to 
be  effective  in  the  treatment  of  brain  tumors  in  mice  by  externally  delivering  reactive 
oxygen  species  (ROS)  to  cancer  cells  while  simultaneously  enhancing  magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) contrast providing real-time tumor kill measurement [5].  

In this paper we study the magnetic targeting of therapeutic carrier particles in the 
microvasculature.  We  consider  noninvasive  therapy  in  which  the  particles  are  injected 
into the vascular system upstream from malignant tissue and captured at the tumor using 
an applied magnetic field provided by a cylindrical magnet positioned outside the body. 
We develop a mathematical model for predicting the transport and capture of the carrier 
particles  taking  into  account  the  dominant  magnetic  and  fluidic  forces.  The  magnet  is 
assumed to be of infinite extent, and oriented with its axis perpendicular to the blood flow 
(Fig. 1). It produces a magnetic field that couples to the magnetic nanoparticles inside the 
carrier  particle,  thereby  producing  a  force  that  attracts  the  carrier  particle  to  the  tumor. 
The fluidic force is predicted using Stokes’ law for the drag on a sphere in a laminar flow 
field. The blood vessel is assumed to be cylindrical with laminar blood flow parallel to its 
axis.  We  use  an  empirically-based  formula  for  the  effective  viscosity  of  blood  in  the 
microvasculature.    

We solve the equations governing the motion of the carrier particle, and obtain an 
analytical expression for predicting its trajectory in a microvessel. This expression can be 
used  to  predict  viability  of  magnetic  targeting  as  a  function  of  the  size  of  the  carrier 
particle,  the  volume  fraction  of  embedded  magnetic  nanoparticles,  the  properties  of  the 
magnet, the diameter of the microvessel, the hematocrit of the blood, and the flow rate. 
Our  analysis  demonstrates  the  viability  of  using  noninvasive  magnetic  targeting  for 
particle delivery to tumors that are within a few centimeters of the field source.  We also 
derive  a  formula  for  predicting  the  volume  fraction  of  magnetic  particles  required  to 
ensure capture of the carrier particle at the tumor. We show that larger carrier particles 
require smaller volume fractions.   

Lastly, while other models exist for predicting magnetic targeting of nanoparticles 
in  vivo,  many  of  these  utilize  numerical  methods  to  solve  for  particle  transport  [6-9]. 
Thus, these models do not provide explicit functional relations for particle capture, and 
only  a  few  account  for  the  rheology  of  blood  in  the  microvasculature  [10-12].  The 
analytical model presented here is ideal for parametric analysis of magnetic targeting in

vivo, and should be useful for the development of novel magnetic targeting methods and 
apparatus.  

 

2. Mathematical Model 
 
Magnetic  transport  of  a  carrier  particle  in  the  vascular  system  is  governed  by  several 
factors  including    (a)  the  magnetic  force,  (b)  viscous  drag,  (c)  particle/blood-cell 
interactions, (d) inertia, (e) buoyancy,  (f) gravity, (g) thermal kinetics (Brownian motion), 
(h) particle/fluid interactions (perturbations to the flow field), and (i) interparticle effects 
such  as  magnetic  dipole  interactions.  A  rigorous  analysis  of  these  effects  is  beyond  the 
scope of this work. Here, we take into account the dominant magnetic and viscous forces, 
and  particle/blood-cell  interactions  using  an  effective  viscosity.  We  predict  particle 
transport by balancing the magnetic and fluidic forces,  mF  and

In order to predict the magnetic force we need a model for the magnetic behavior of the 
mpN  
carrier  particle.  To  this  end,  we  simplify  the  analysis  and  assume  that  there  are 
identical  noninteracting  magnetic  nanoparticles  embedded  in  the  carrier  particle.  Each

magnetic  particle  using  an  effective  dipole  moment  approach  in  which  the  particle  is 
replaced  by  an  “equivalent”  point  dipole,  which  is  located  at  its  center  [11].  The  force 
depends  on  the  magnetic  field  at  the  location  of  the  dipole.  Although  the  magnetic 
particles  are  distributed  throughout  the  carrier  particle,  we  compute  the  force  on  each 
particle using the field at the center of the carrier particle. Accordingly, the total magnetic 
force on the carrier particle is the sum of the forces on the embedded magnetic particles 
and is given by

Equations  (8)  and  (9)  can  be  simplified  further.  Specifically,  in  noninvasive  magnetic 
targeting  the  distance  from  the  magnet  to  the  blood  vessel  is  much  larger  than  the 
diameter  of  the  blood  vessel  itself,  and  therefore
x d << .  Also,  the  magnetic 
nanoparticles used in bioapplications are usually made from biocompatible materials such 
as magnetite (Fe3O4)  for which mp

Since the magnetic force is confined to the x-z plane, it suffices to consider motion in this 
plane only, thereby reducing the analysis to two dimensions.

2.2 Fluidic Force 
 
fv  in the blood 
To evaluate the fluidic force we need an expression for the fluid velocity 
vessel. We assume that the vessel is cylindrical and that the blood flow is fully developed 
laminar flow parallel to the axis. Based on these assumptions, the blood velocity is

where fv  is  the  average  blood  velocity  and

fluidic  force  components  are  determined  by  substituting  Eq.  (12)  into  Eq.    (3).  We 
consider motion in the x-z plane and obtain,

2.3 Equations of Motion 

 

The equations of motion for a carrier particle traveling through a microvessel can be 
written in component form by substituting Eqs. (8), (9),  (13) and (14) into Eq.  (1). We 
solve for the velocity components in the x-z plane and obtain,

Equations. (18) and (19) are coupled and can be solved  numerically to predict the 
particle trajectory (x(t),z(t)). However, it is possible to uncouple these equations and 
obtain an analytical solution. Specifically, for practical noninvasive targeting systems,

and  therefore  the  fluidic  force  in  Eq.  (19)  is  dominant.  We  simplify  the  analysis  by 
assuming  that  the  average  axial  velocity  of  the  carrier  particle 
 equals  the  average

First,  we  use  Eq.  (27)  to  determine 

vf,100β  for  a  range  of  carrier  particle  sizes: 
cpR = 200 -1000 nm. The initial axial position of each particle is  0
, which is 
z
far  enough  upstream  from  the  magnet  so  that  the  magnetic  force  is  initially  negligible. 
From  this  analysis  we  find  that  it  is  not  possible  to  ensure  100%  capture  of  all  of  the 
particles  (Figure  3).  Specifically,  particles  with

particles  are  captured  either  before  or  at  the  center  of  the  magnet,  i.e. 
consistent  with  data  in  Figure  3.  The  second  set  of  trajectories  is  computed  using  a 
magnetic  particle  volume  fraction  of  20%,  which  from  Figure  3  should  result  in  partial 
carrier particle capture. The predicted trajectories do confirm partial capture as shown in 
Figure 4b. Specifically, carrier particles that start at

correspond to spacings of 20 mm, 30 mm, 40 mm and 50 mm, respectively, between the 
edge of the magnet and the center of the microvessel (Figure 5). As expected, the carrier 
particle  size  and  volume  fraction  required  for  capture  increase  when  the  microvessel  is 
farther from the magnet.

In  summary,  the  analysis  demonstrates  the  viability  of  using  noninvasive 
magnetic therapy for drug targeting to malignant tissue that is within a few centimeters 
from  the  surface  of  the  body.  Moreover,  the  theory  developed  herein  can  be  used  to 
determine the optimum magnet parameters and particle size for treating a tumor, given its 
size and location within the body. Thus, this work should useful in the development of 
new drug targeting apparatus and treatments.

4. Conclusion 
 
We have developed a mathematical model for studying magnetic targeting of therapeutic 
carrier  particles  in  the  microvasculature.  The  model  applies  to  noninvasive  therapy  and 
takes into account the dominant magnetic and fluidic forces that govern the motion of a 
carrier  particle.  A  key  result  of  this  work  is  an  analytical  formula  for  predicting  the 
volume  fraction  of  magnetic  nanoparticles  embedded  in  the  carrier  particle  that  is 
required  to  ensure  its  capture  at  the  tumor.  We  have  used  the  model  to  study  magnetic 
targeting,  and  our  results  indicate  that  this  can  be  achieved  using  submicron  carrier 
particles when the tumor is within a few centimeters of the surface of the body.

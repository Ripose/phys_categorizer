The  super-algebraic  structure  of  a  generalized  version  of  the  Jaynes-Cummings 
 
model is investigated. We find that a Z2 graded extension of the so(2,1) Lie algebra is 
the underlying symmetry of this model. It is isomorphic to the four-dimensional super-
algebra  u(1/1)  with  two  odd  and  two  even  elements.  Differential  matrix  operators  are 
taken as realization of the elements of the superalgebra to which the model Hamiltonian 
belongs.  Several  examples  with  various  choices  of  superpotentials  are  presented.  The 
energy spectrum and corresponding wavefunctions are obtained analytically.

I. INTRODUCTION 

 
 
 
The Jaynes-Cummings  (JC)  model is a simple model for the description of one-
photon exchange with a two-level atomic system [1]. The model has been the target of 
extensive studies in the literature [2]. Its simplicity allows exact analytic application of 
the fundamental laws of quantum electrodynamics. Moreover, its exact solvability in the 
rotating  wave  approximation  exhibits  interesting  quantum  mechanical  effects  like  the 
collapses and revivals of Rabi oscillations [3]. These effects have important applications 
in optical communication [4] and laser trapping and cooling of atoms [5]. It enables one 
to study, in a simple but realistic way, not only the coherent properties of the quantized 
field, but also its influence on atoms (e.g., collapses and revivals [6], squeezing [7], the 
interaction  of  a  trapped  ion  with  a  laser  field  [8],  etc.).  The  JC  model  has  been  the 
subject  of  many  generalizations  including  multi-level  and  multi-mode  systems  [9], 
intensity-dependent  and  time-dependent  coupling  [10].  The  JC  model  was  generalized 
using the methods of supersymmetric quantum mechanics where the usual creation and 
annihilation  operators  of  the  harmonic  oscillator  become  generalized  creation  and 
annihilation  operators  satisfying  the  supersymmetric  algebra  [11].  Applications  of  the 
supersymmetric  approach  to  the  JC  model,  including  representation  theory  of  super-
algebras, have opened large venues for the exact solvability of the model. In fact, as will 
be demonstrated here, the supersymmetric JC Hamiltonian is an element of the  u(1/1) 
superalgebra  [12].  Additionally,  shape  invariance  studies  of  bound  state  problems  for 
two-level  systems  also  lead  to  generalized  JC  models  [11].  In  the  case  of  exact 
resonance, the u(1/1) dynamical superalgebra reduces to N = 2 supersymmetric algebra 
where  the  JC  model  coincides  with  the  supersymmetric  harmonic  oscillator  (the 
standard JC model).

In this work, we exploit the (super-) symmetry of a generalized version of the JC 
 
model and obtain some of its relevant and interesting analytic solutions. We show that 
this generalized model carries a representation of a superalgebra which is a Z2 graded 
extension  of  the  so(2,1)  Lie  algebra.  This  superalgebra  was  introduced  in  [13]  while 
searching for solutions of the Dirac equation where we found that the “canonical form” 
of the Dirac Hamiltonian is an element of this superalgebra. It is the lowest in a special 
superalgebra hierarchy [14]. Moreover, it is isomorphic to u(1/1) Lie superalgebra [12]. 
Most of earlier work on the analytic solutions of the two-level JC model was limited to 
the  underlying  symmetries  associated  with  N  =  2  supersymmetry,  su(2)  or  su(1,1) 
symmetry. Moreover, the superpotentials used in the supersymmetric studies were very 
limited.  Here,  as  well,  we  will  not  be  able  to  exhaust  all  possibilities  but  give  several 
exact  solutions  for  interesting  and  non-trivial  superpotential  examples.  Now,  so(2,1) 
algebra  is  a  three  dimensional  Lie  algebra  with  basis  elements  satisfying  the 
]
commutation  relations  [
− = − .  It  is  very  useful  and  highly 
important in various physical applications, and in the solution of many three-parameter 
problems.  It  has  been  studied  extensively  in  the  literature  as  a  potential  algebra  and 
spectrum-generating algebra for several problems [15]. Following Kac and others [16], 
we  define  a  superalgebra G   as  the  Z2  graded  algebra 
G G G   with  a  product 
operation  (cid:68)   satisfying 
,  where  σ(p,q)  =  deg(p)  ×  deg(q)  and 
p ∈G , m = 0 or 1. An element of G  is called even (odd) if it belongs 
deg(p) = m ↔ 
1G ).  We  call  the  anti-symmetric  product  operation  (cid:68)   which  involves  an  even 
to 
element  the  commutator  and  designate  it  by  [ , ]   while  the  symmetric  operation  that 
involves  only  odd  elements  is  called  the  anti-commutator,  and  is  designated  by  {
},
. 
The  Z2  grading  of  so(2,1)  Lie  algebra  of  concern  to  us  is  a  four-dimensional  super-
algebra,  with  two  odd  elements  L±  and  two  even  elements,  L0  and  L3,  satisfying  the 
commutation/anticommutation relations [13]:

).  These  relations  also  show  that  L0  belongs  to  the  center  of  the  superalgebra 
3
since it commutes with all of its elements. Additionally, this superalgebra has a second 
order Casimir invariant operator, which could be written as

we  are  not  concerened  with  the  general  representations  of  this  superalgebra.  We  will

. In this representation, the Casimir operator (5) is not independent 
.  The  odd  operators  L±  are  the  raising  and  lowering 
(creation  and  annihilation)  operators  in  a  two-component  Hilbert  space.  They  are  first 
order in the derivatives, whereas the even operators are zero and second order. L3 is the 
helicity/parity operator. Now, since L0 is in the center of the algebra, then its eigenvalue 
L χ χ . Therefore, one can interpret the diagonal 
is an invariant and we can write 
elements  of  L0  as  Schrödinger  operators  resulting  in  the  identification  of  the  two 
. In supersymmetric quantum mechanics these are the two 
potential functions 
isospectral  (i.e.,  having  the  same  spectrum)  superpartner  potentials  [17].  If  a  linear 
operator  H  belongs  to  the  superalgebra  (i.e.,  carries  a  representation  of  this  super-
symmetry),  then  H  could  be  expanded  as  a  linear  combination  of  these  four  basis 
elements as follows:

energy  spectrum  of  the  bound  states  and  the  corresponding  two-component  wave 
function are obtained analytically. Our method of solution goes as follows. A coordinate 
⊆ ℜ  is carried out. In the

Reality of the solution puts a stronger constraint on ω, the eigenvalues of L0, which is 
)2
2γ ω µ λ
. For bound states, square integrability requires that the confluent 
that 
≥ −
hypergeometric series  1 1(
 terminate. This is accomplished by choosing  a±  to 
be  a  negative  integer  or  zero  [19].  Imposing  this  requirement  on  the  solutions  in  (20) 
restricts ω to be an element of the following infinite discrete set, 

F a c y

where 
if  the  physical  parameters κ  and γ  are  of  opposite  sign  (i.e., 
0γκ< ).  These  discrete 
values  of ω  conform  to  the  requirement  of  reality  of  the  representation,  which  is  that

III. CONCLUSION 

 
 
In this work, we have shown that the generalized JC Hamiltonian model given by 
Eq. (10) is endowed with a high degree of (super-) symmetry, which we have exploited 
to  obtain  analytic  solutions  of  various  interesting  examples  of  the  model.  The 
underlying  dynamical  symmetry  is  associated  with  a  special  four-dimensional  super-
algebra defined by Eq. (4). It is a Z2 graded extension of su(1,1) Lie algebra which is 
isomorphic  to  the  superalgebra  u(1/1).  A  special  realization  of  the  generators  of  this 
superalgebra  was  employed.  This  realization  is  suitable  for  the  description  of  the 
interaction of a bosonic field, depicted by W(x), with a two-level atomic system whose 
effective mass (frequency) is µ. The coupling strength is given by λ. Several examples 
with different field configurations were given. Analytic solutions (energy spectrum and 
state functions) were obtained. A connection between this generalized JC model and the 
Dirac Hamiltonian with pseudo scalar potential coupling was indicated.

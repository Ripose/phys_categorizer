Calibration  of 

  hadron 
calorimeters  in  situ  by  the  LHC  beam  is  proposed. 
Simulations  show  that  bent  crystal  channeling  technique 
is feasible at the LHC, and report the experience of IHEP 
Protvino  in  bending  70  GeV  protons  by  9  degrees  (150 
mrad)  during  10  years 
in  1994-2004  experiments. 
Practical  realization  of  calibration  scheme  based  on 
simulations and previous experience is proposed.  

 

INTRODUCTION 

for 

The  goal  of  the  absolute  energy  scale  (about  1%) 
the  collider 
the  new  generation  of 
required 
experiments  is  a  very  tough  task.  Calibration  of  hadron 
calorimeters  with  fixed 
is  practically 
impossible: 

target  beam 

- in case the calorimeters are supposed to be placed 
in  a  magnetic  field  any  calibration  outside  of  magnetic 
field is a rough approximation because the scintillator and 
a  sandwich  calorimeter    response  depend  on  magnetic 
field value and its orientation; 

- transportation of calibration coefficients obtained 
with  external  beams  is  not  an  easy  task  (requires  some 
corrections  connected,  for  example,  with  influence  of 
magnetic field on calorimeter response). 
Absolute  calibration  in  situ,  utilizing  some  physical 
processes,  is  time  consuming  procedure  providing  only 
limited precision (particularly for forward direction due to 
large number of mini-bias events): 
         -  "in  the  forward  direction  Z  +jet  utility  becomes 
more questionable"   [1];  
        - same arguments are applicable to "γ+jet"; 
        -  for  the  process  W→jet  in  t  -⎯t  events  there  is  no 
estimation  for forward  calorimeters,  the  pile  up  can be  a 
serious problem. 
Besides  a  single  hadron  response  of 
the  forward 
calorimeters  is  important  also  if  B  physics  is  planned  to 
study. There is no reliable way to do it in situ. 

An  ideal  solution  would  be  to  irradiate  the 
assembled  calorimeters  by  high  energy  beam.  There  is 
such  beam  in  hadron  collides  –  circulating  proton  beam.  
And  the  method  to  direct  the  beam  into  the  detectors  is 
well known.  

BEAM BENDING METHOD 
To irradiate CMS detectors, one would need to bend the 
beam circulating in the LHC by a huge angle, order of 1-

 

10  degrees  (17-170  mrad)  .  Beam  intensity  as  low  as  1-
1000 p/s would be sufficient for calibration purposes. 

Such a bending is possible indeed, but only by extreme, 
~1000-Tesla-strong  fields  of  bent  crystal.  The  technique 
of  particle  beam  channeling  by  bent  crystals  is  well 
established  at  accelerators  [2].  Broad  experience  is 
obtained  with  bent  channeling  crystals  at  IHEP,  CERN 
SPS, Tevatron, and RHIC over recent decades [2-15]. For 
instance,  bent  crystals  are  largely  used  for  extraction  of 
70-GeV  protons  at  IHEP  (Protvino)  [11-15]  with 
efficiency  reaching  85%  at  intensity  of  1012  particle  per 
second,  steered  by  silicon  crystal  of  just  2  mm  in  length 
[12]. Much of the IHEP physics program relies on crystal 
channeled  beams  regularly  used  since  1989.  Following 
the  successful  experiments  on  crystal  channeling  in 
accelerator rings, there has been a strong interest to apply 
channeling  technique  in  a  TeV-range  collider  for  beam 
extraction or collimation [2-8,16-18]. 

IHEP EXPERIMENT ON CRYSTAL 
BENDING OF 70 GeV PROTONS BY  
150 MRAD 
The  possibility  of  beam  bending  by  a  channeling  crystal 
through very large angles, order of 100 mrad, was studied 
at  Protvino.  In  1994-2004  IHEP  has  operated  a 
channeling crystal 100 mm long to bend 70 GeV beam a 
huge  angle  of  150  mrad  (9  degrees!)  [19,20].  This  was 
done with the purpose to organize over a short base a non-
traditional  beam  line.  A  100  mm  long  Si  (110)  crystal 
deflected  106  proton/s  beyond  the  2-meter  iron-concrete 
shield over 20 m base, out of about 1010 proton/s hitting 
the crystal. The crystal efficiency was in agreement with 
calculation.  The  orientation-independent  component  of 
the signal (background particles) did not exceed 3% of the 
channeled  beam.  The  scheme  of  150-mrad  crystal  beam 
line  operated  at  IHEP  at  106  proton/s  in  1994-2004  is 
shown  in  Figure  1.  This  crystal  beam  line  was  used 
mostly  for  our  studies  of  channeling.  It  consumed 
practically no power and allowed one to work in parallel 
with other beam lines without affecting other physical set-
ups operation. 
 

Besides this 150-mrad bent crystal used in 1994-2004, 
another example in IHEP experience was an 85-mrad bent 
crystal  used  for  extraction  in  1989-1999  over  10  years 
until a new crystal replaced it [2]. 

 

 
 
 

SIMULATIONS FOR THE LHC BEAM 
BENDING BY 1-20 DEGREES 

In order to find out whether one can extrapolate the 
70 GeV experience onto the LHC case of much higher 
energy  range,  we  performed  Monte  Carlo  simulations 
in  many  other 
applying 
channeling  experiments 
the 
theoretical calculations can be found, e.g., in book [2]. 

the  code  [21-23]  used 

[6-15].  Details  of 

Our  preliminary  study  assumed  a  crystal  of  50  cm 
size,  which  is  a  reasonable  figure  available  on  the 
market  in  Russia  and  Europe.  Earlier,  IHEP  has  used 
up to 15 cm long Si crystals for channeling.  

An  example  of 

the  calculation  of  efficient 
transmission  of  LHC  beam  with  Silicon  crystal  at  the 
energies  of  450  GeV  (injection  level  in  the  LHC)  and 
1000 GeV is shown in Figure 2. Respectively, bending 
angles  up  to  about  7  and  11  degrees  can  be  realized 
with Si crystal at these energies.

with a single Si crystal 500 mm long as a function of 
the bending angle (degrees). 

 
 

 
We  have  run  computations  for  Silicon  and 
Germanium crystals of 50 cm size and the LHC energy 
range from injection, 450 GeV, through the top energy, 
7 TeV. Some preliminary results are shown on Figure 3 
for  the  bending  angle  achievable  with  a  single  Si 
crystal of 50 cm length as a function of the LHC beam 
energy.

crystal of 50 cm length as a function of the LHC beam 
energy. 
 

Thus    simulations  show:  if  the  beam  energy  is 
limited  to  the  injection  energy  (450  GeV)  that  is 
sufficient for reliable measurement of the energy scale 
the size of the crystal can be a modest one.  

All  towers  of  the  hadron  calorimeters  (HE  and 
HF) are irradiated by a radioactive source and relative 
coefficients  are  known  for  all  towers  therefore  in 
principle it is sufficient to define an energy scale only 
for  a  single  tower.  But  due  to  harsh  radiation 
environment in forward direction the active calorimeter 
elements  can  be  damaged.  Therefore  control  of  the 
tower  performance 
in  all  available 
psevdorapidity  range  (no  scanning  in  ϕ    is  required  

required 

is 

because  of  the  axial  symmetry).  The  solution  of  the 
task is depicted in fig. 4. Not all channeled

particles are bent  to a maximum angle. Positive feature 
of large crystal bending for calibration is wide angular  
region  of  the  deflected  particles:  there  are  present  not 
only  fully  deflected  particles,  but  also  some  particles 
dechanneled  in  a  crystal  bulk  and  thus  deflected    at 
smaller angle. 
 

LAYOUT OF A CALIBRATION 

SCHEME 
 Example  of  the  realization  of  the  proposed  method  is 
illustrated  in  fig.  5  where  the  central  part  of  CMS  is 
shown.  A  crystal  can  be  placed 
the 
electromagnetic  calorimeter  EE.  Then  the  maximum 
particle bending angle will be about 120 and the proton 
beam  will  strike  HE  tower  far  enough  from  the  inner 
edge  to  avoid  leakage  into  HF.  On  the  other  hand  the 
combined  performance  of  HE  and  HF  can  not  be 
 

inside  of 

HE 

EE 

studied  with  extracted  beams  and  the  use  of  the 
channeled crystal  inserted in  beam  is the only way to 
measure this characteristic. 

The  place  inside  of  the  EE  is  shown  in  fig.  6. 
There  is  a  bellows  to  join  two  parts  of  the  beam  pipe 
and no special efforts are needed to insert a crystal. The 
maximal available Si crystal length is  about 350 mm. 
According  to  the  fig.6  after  removing  the  part  of  the 
pipe with the bells there is a free space 410 mm length. 
The  bent  crystal  can  be  fixed  in  a  Π  shape 
aluminum  profile  presented  in  fig.7  and  positioned  in 
the  beam  pipe  (fig.  8).  There  exist  several  possible 
options  to  direct  the  particles  at  the  crystal  which 
depend  on  the  dynamics  of  the  beam.  For  example  if 
the  injected  450  GeV  beam  has  appreciable  halo  the 
crystal can be placed at such distance from the axis that 
the beam halo will overlap the crystal. This period can 
be  used  for  calorimeter  calibration.  After  the  proton 
accumulation  the  beam  halo  is  decreased  and  the 
crystal will be outside of the beam. The other way is to 
use  existing  magnetic  elements  to  steer  the  beam  into 
the  crystal.    No  moving  parts  (goniometer  and  so  on) 
are  needed  due  to  application  of  special  crystal  with 
triangular shape of entry face (fig. 9). Such crystal type 
has distributed acceptance and its initial alignment with 
an  accuracy  of  about  few  milliradian  is  enough    for 
channeling  achievement.  At  fig.  10  the  diminish-scale 
model of necessary crystal device is presented. The full 
scale  device can be constructed and tested in 2006 test 
beam time with HE and HF prototypes.

CONCLUSION 

The  simple  method  can  be  used  for  absolute 
calibration  in  real  environment.  Unique  characteristic 
(such as the combine performance of HE and HF) can 
be  thoroughly  studied.  The  calibration  can  be  done 
regularly (at least each day). So it can be used for the 
control  also  (variation  of  scale  and  resolution  with 
time).  No  radioactive  sours  can  give  this  information 
(if some channel failed the resulting degradation of the 
energy resolution can not be calculated). 

For HE calibration the maximum required angle 
is about 120 that is close for the present achievements. 
As  for  HF  the  bending  angle  is  well  within  the 
currently  used  range  and  it  will  not  require  additional 
study.

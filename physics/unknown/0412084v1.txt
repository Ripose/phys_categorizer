We  consider  eigen  modes  of  a  ring  resonator  made  of  a  circular  dielectric  waveguide. 
Taking into account the polarization corrections, which are responsible for the interaction 
of polarization and orbital properties of electromagnetic waves (spin-orbital interaction of 
photons), results in fine splitting of the levels of scalar approximation. The basic features of 
this  fine  structure  of  the  levels  are  quite  similar  to  that  of  electron  levels  in  an  atom. 
Namely:  1)  sublevels  of  the  fine  structure  are  defined  by  an  additional  quantum  number: 
product  of  helicity  of  the  wave  and  its  orbital  moment;  2)  each  level  of  the  scalar 
approximation splits into  N  sublevels ( N  is the principal quantum number); 3) each level 
of  the  fine  structure  remains  twice  degenerated  due  to  local  axial  symmetry  of  the 
waveguide. Numerical estimations show that the described fine splitting of levels may be 
observed in optic-fiber ring resonators.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Spin-orbital  interaction  (SOI)  phenomenon  is  well-known  from  the  relativistic  theory  of 
particles with a spin [1]. Also known is the SOI of non-relativistic electrons in solid lattices (see 
[2] and references there). First of all this phenomenon leads to the fine splitting of eigen levels of 
the  particle;  in  particular  it  determines  the  fine  structure  of  the  electron  levels  in  an  atom  [1]. 
Besides, SOI results in the transport effects as well. In this way a particle freely propagating in 
an external field experiences action of an additional forces connected with the SOI. Recently it 
was  revealed  that  in  some  cases  such  forces  have  a  topological  nature  and  determine  the  so-
called topological spin transport of particles (see, for instance, [3] and references there).  

SOI  is  well  investigated  for  massive  particles.  However,  for  a  long  time  nothing  was 
known  about  SOI  of  massless  particles  with  a  spin  –  for  instance,  photons.  Meanwhile  the 
photons  are  rather  convenient  objects  for  studying  spin  properties,  since  they  are  nothing  else 
than  the  polarization  effects  for  classical  electromagnetic  waves  (see  an  example  of  a  Berry 
phase that for the first time was predicted and observed for electromagnetic waves [4]).  

The concept of the “spin-orbital interaction of photons” was for the first time proposed by 
Liberman  and  Zel’dovich  in  1992  in  the  paper  [5]  (see  also  [6]).  There  the  so-called  optical 
Magnus effect was described (it was discovered by Zel’dovich et al. [7] shortly before this). The 
essence of the effect consists in the dependence of an electromagnetic wave (photon) trajectory 
on  its  polarization  (a  spin  state  or  helicity)  in  locally  isotropic  inhomogeneous  medium.  This 
transport effect can be considered as a correction to classical Snell’s law, according to which the 
refraction of an electromagnetic wave depends on its polarization [8] (see also [6] and references 
there). In recent works [9−13] it was shown that the optical Magnus effect represents nothing but 
the topological spin transport of photons and is closely connected with Berry phase.

Note that in all mentioned works SOI of photons manifests itself as a transport effect for 
freely  propagating  particles,  but  the  possibility  of  fine  splitting  of  energy  levels  was  not 
mentioned anywhere (the reason, probably, is in the difficulty of the localization of a helical state 
of a photon). In the present work we for  the first time give an example of the  fine splitting of 
levels due to SOI of photons. For this we consider a ring dielectric resonator made of a circular 
multimode  waveguide  (exactly  in  such  open  waveguide  the  SOI  of  photons  (optical  Magnus 
effect) have been discovered for the first time in [7]). The main idea of the present paper is as 
follows. 

Characteristics  of  the  eigen  modes  of  a  dielectric  waveguide  are  practically  polarization-
independent,  that  is  in  the  zero  approximation  the  polarization  degeneration  takes  place. 
Inhomogeneity  of  a  refraction  index  profile  in  the  waveguide  leads  to  small  polarization 
corrections,  which  are  connected  to  the  polarization  and  profile  inhomogeneity  [14].  The 
corrections  describe  SOI  of  photons  and  establish  the  dependence  of  the  mode  propagation 
constant on the polarization. Thus they remove the polarization degeneration. In the case of an 
open  circular  waveguide  these  corrections  result  in  azimuthal  rotation  of  a  speckle  pattern 
depending  on  the  polarization  of  radiation,  this  is  transport  optical  Magnus  effect  [7].  If  one 
closes  the  waveguide  and  make  in  this  way  a  ring  resonator  with  discrete  values  of  the 
propagation constant, than obviously taking the polarization corrections into account will lead to 
fine splitting of levels. Bellow we will show that the main features of the fine structure of levels 
turn out to be quite similar to that of electron levels in an atom.

In paraxial approximation the influence of the right-hand part of the equation (2) is small 
(even for waveguides with a step index) and it may be considered as perturbation [14]. Then in 
zero approximation Eq. (2) looks as a scalar wave equation. It means that field characteristics of 
the  modes  do  not  depend  in  any  way  on  its  polarization  (a  spin  state),  thus  polarizing 
degeneration  takes  place.  The  correction  in  the  right-hand  side  of  Eq. (2)  depends  on  wave 
polarization, and taking it into account removes the polarization degeneration of the modes. In 
fact,  the  right-hand  part  of  Eq. (2)  describes  SOI  of  an  electromagnetic  field  (photons):  it 
represents  a  combination  of  polarization  and  orbital  characteristics  of  the  field  (compare  with 
[6,8−13]).

3. LEVELS OF THE RING RESONATOR IN SCALAR APPROXIMATION 

Let  us  consider  a  dielectric  ring  resonator,  which  constitutes  a  multimode  circular 
waveguide  (optical  fiber,  for  instance)  convoluted  in  a  ring.  The  radius  of  the  ring,  R ,  is 
supposed to be much larger than the radius of the waveguide,  r : 

 

(5) 
this  allows  one  to  not  take  into  account  the  bend  of  the  fiber  at  the  local  analysis  of  modes. 
Owing  to  this  it  is  possible  to  think  that  eigen  modes  of  the  resonator  locally  represent 
propagating modes of a straight circular waveguide with the additional condition of quantization 
being imposed.

For simplicity of analytical calculations we assume that the fiber has a parabolic refractive

Expression (24) is the central result of this paper; this is the equation that determines the

Hamiltonian of SOI for a massive particle in a central-symmetric field [1], is also proportional to 
the  scalar  product  of  the  spin  and  the  orbital  moment).  Since  levels  of  the  resonator  in  zero 
approximation Eq. (14) are characterized by quantum numbers 
 and  q  only, than a multitude

Note  also  that  SOI  correction  (24)  does  not  remove  polarization  degeneration  of  levels 
completely:  simultaneous  change  of  the  sign  of  the  helicity  and  the  orbital  moment  does  not 
change a level. Thus each level remains twice degenerated (without taking into account SOI it 
was  degenerated  2

symmetry of the waveguide [15]. Indeed, instead of complex modes (4)  e

5. CONCLUSION 

In conclusion, we have considered the influence of the spin-orbital interaction (SOI) on the 
structure of levels of a ring dielectric resonator. Examples of SOI of photons that was analyzed 
before  produced  additional  transport  effects  only  [5−13].  The  possibility  of  splitting  and 
formation of a fine structure of levels of the localized photon states is for the first time described 
in  the  present  paper.  It  is  quite  similar  to  how  it  takes  place  for  electrons  in  atoms.  The  main 
result  is  that  taking  into  account  the  polarization  corrections,  which  are  responsible  for  SOI, 
results  in  partial  removal  of  the  degeneration  and  splitting  of  each  level  of  the  scalar 
approximation  into  a  multiplet  of 
  equidistant  sublevels.  Each  sublevel  is  determined  by  an 
mσ , which is a product of the helicity and the orbital moment of the 
additional quantum number 
mode.  Besides,  each  sublevel  remains  twice  degenerated  due  to  local  axial  symmetry  of  the 
waveguide.  Thus  a  close  analogy  with  the  spin-orbital  interaction  and  the  fine  structure  of 
electron levels in atoms [1] takes place. In spite of the fact that the particular parabolic profile of 
the  refraction  index  in  the  waveguide  was  considered  in  the  paper,  all  conclusions  remain 
qualitatively true for an arbitrary profile including the step one as well [14]. 

N

The  numerical  estimations  given  above  for  an  optical  fiber  shows  that  the  characteristic 
1 10−
4
− ÷
interval of the fine structure of levels makes 10
 characteristic intervals between levels in 
scalar  approximation.  This  allows  one  to  expect  that  the  phenomenon  can  be  observed 
experimentally. It may have an effect on the performance of resonant ring interferometers made 
of  a  multimode  fiber  [16].  In  addition,  splitting  of  the  levels  at  the  presence  of  rotation  or 
additional  Faraday  elements  in  a  circuit  may  cause  interesting  structures  similar  to  driving 
quantum multilevel systems [17].

coordinate ϕ the electric field vector makes precisely  mσ  revolutions (positive revolutions are 
clockwise and negative are anticlockwise).

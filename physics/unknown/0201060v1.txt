ABSTRACT 

Ga-rich  GaAs  (001)  surfaces  are  successfully  observed  during  high-temperature 

annealing  by  scanning  tunneling  microscopy  (STM).  With  a  substrate  temperature  of  550  oC, 

reflection high-energy diffraction patterns and reflectance anisotropy spectra confirm a (4x2) Ga-

stabilized  surface.  STM  images  clearly  show  alteration  of  the  surface  reconstructions  while 

scanning. It is postulated that detaching and attaching of Ga adatoms may be the cause of these 

surface  dynamics.  For  these  conditions  it  is  determined  that  ζ(4x4),  ζ2(4x4)  and  ζ(4x6) 

reconstructions  co-exist  on  the  surface.  The  ζ2(4x4)  reconstruction  contains  a  Ga  tetramer 

cluster and in more Ga-rich conditions, the ζ2(4x6) surface has a Ga octamer cluster.

The  complexity  and  variety  of  surface  reconstructions  observed  on  semiconductors  has 

been  an  intriguing  problem  in  surface  science.  Recently,  combined  molecular  beam  epitaxy 

(MBE)  and  scanning  tunneling  microscopy  (STM)  systems  have  provided  a  very  powerful 

technique for the real-space observation of semiconductor surfaces, especially GaAs(001), with 

extremely high resolution[1-5]. Avery et al. reported STM studies of MBE grown submonolayer 

islands in the pre-coalescence regime on the three low-index surfaces of GaAs[6,7]. In Ref.7, the 

dynamics  of  the  As-rich  surface  during  growth  were  inferred  by  comparing  room-temperature 

STM ‘snapshots’ with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations[7]. Ga-rich surfaces[8-10] are especially 

difficult  to  study  due  to  a  transition  in  surface  reconstruction  between  high  and  low 

temperatures[11]. Therefore, if samples are cooled and transferred to a cleaner environment for 

STM  analysis,  the  surfaces  are  no  longer  representative  of  the  one  at  high  temperature.  STM 

analysis  at  high-temperature  needs  to  be  performed.  In  this  paper,  the  Ga-rich  GaAs  (001) 

surfaces were successfully observed during high temperature annealing by STM. 

Si-doped  GaAs(001)  1o  off  <111>A  (n  =  2x1018  cm-3)  substrates  were  prepared  by 

standard solvent cleaning and etching procedures, and then loaded into the MBE chamber. After

the oxide was removed at 600 oC under an As4 flux of 2x10-5 torr, an undoped GaAs buffer layer 

of 1.0 µm was grown at 580 oC with the following conditions: As4/Ga flux ratio ~30, growth rate 

1.0  µm/hour  and  background  pressure  of  2x10-7  torr.  This  resulted  in  a  smooth  GaAs  surface 

with single bilayer steps. The samples were then annealed at 550oC without As overpressure in 

order  to  produce  a  (4x2)  phase  surface  as  determined  by  reflection  high-energy  electron 

diffraction  (RHEED)[12,13],  as  shown  in  Fig.1(a).  The  background  pressure  was  2x10-11  torr. 

Under the same conditions reflectance anisotropy spectra (RAS or RDS) and STM images were 

obtained. 

 

The RAS spectrum, shown in Fig.1(b), indicates a (4x2) Ga-stabilized surface. The STM 

images show steps and a few islands present on the surface. Figure 2 shows the changes in the 

surface  reconstruction  observed  by  STM.  Line  scans  and  correlation  functions  of  the  surface 

confirm  the  clear  4x  periodicity in the  [1-10]  direction  and  show  regions  of  the  surface  with  a 

periodicity of x3 and x4 in the [110]. 

What  are  the possible surface  reconstructions that are  consistent  with  RHEED  analysis, 

RAS  measurement  and  the  STM  images?  The  STM  data  strongly  points  to  a  co-existence  of 

reconstructions.  One  set  of  candidates  is  the  ζ(4x4),  ζ(4x6),  and  ζ2(4x4)  reconstructions,  as 

shown in Fig.3(a), (b), and (c) respectively. All models are based on ζ(4x2) by Lee et al.[8] and 

satisfy electron-counting heuristics. The models differ in the presence and location of Ga atoms. 

At  elevated  temperatures  Ga  adatoms  can  detach  and  diffuse  to  make  Ga  clusters[14].  These 

dynamics may be the cause for the changes shown in Fig.2. Mobile Ga would result in different 

surface reconstructions on different parts of the surface as seen in Fig.2. 

In  the  ζ(4x4)  reconstruction  shown  in  Fig.3(a),  50%  of  the  Ga  dimers  in  ζ(4x2)  are 

missing and four As dangling bonds make two As dimers. Therefore, the STM images show that 

 

- 3 - 

  

 

 

the trench is unfilled as indicated by a white arrow in Fig.2(i). The ζ2(4x4) reconstruction, shown 

in Fig.3(c), does not make As dimers but depends on a Ga tetramer magic cluster that consists of 

4 adatoms and is able to supply 4 electrons to the four As dangling bonds[15]. The STM image 

of  this  reconstruction  would  show  that  the  trench  is  partially  filled  with  the  Ga  clusters  as 

indicated by white arrow in Fig.2(g). The ζ(4x6) reconstruction, shown in Fig.3(b), has two out 

of three Ga dimers missing as well as two As adatoms in each missing Ga dimer region. After 

restructuring, two Ga and two pairs of As form new dimers. This surface leads to STM images 

that show dark lines every three lattices units along [110] as indicated by white arrow in Fig.2(h). 

Each  of  these  reconstructions  does  not  form  large  domains  and  is  distributed  randomly  on  the 

(001) surface. This reasonably explains why we do not observe the 1/4- and 1/6-order reflections 

in RHEED  patterns obtained  along  the  [1-10]  direction.  However,  since  all  reconstructions  are 

derived  from  the  ζ(4x2),  the  surface  dynamics  associated  with  Ga  motion[14]  will  produce 

transiant regions with this symmetry. Therefore, it is natural to observe the 1/2-order reflection 

along the [1-10] direction. 

From STM images, we can determine the average distribution of the ζ(4x4), ζ(4x6), and 

ζ2(4x4)  reconstructions,  which  are  61%,  19%,  and  20%,  respectively.  For  this  mixed  surface 

structure  the  occupancies  of  Ga  dimers  and  cluster  sites  are  determined  to  be  47%  and  20%, 

respectively.  The  average  coverage  of  surface  Ga  adatoms  is  0.67  ML.  These  values  are 

consistent  with  the  results  determined  by  surface  x-ray  diffraction  using  direct  methods  by 

Kumpf et al.[10] and by rocking-curve analysis of RHEED[16].  

For the more Ga-rich case, ζ2(4x6) surface, which contains a Ga octamer magic cluster, 

is predicted to be formed as shown in Fig.3(d). This Ga octamer is also able to supply 4 electrons 

 

- 4 - 

  

 

 

to  the  As  dangling  bonds  to  satisfy  electron  counting[15].  The  ζ2(4x6)  is  not  observed  in  our 

samples,  but  matches  very  well  with  the  Ga  dosed  (4x6)  surface  observed  by  Xue  et  al.  with 

STM [13,17]. In the ζ2(4x6) model, the occupancies of Ga dimers and cluster sites are estimated 

as 67% and 133%, respectively. Therefore, the coverage of surface Ga adatoms is estimated as 1 

ML, which is also very consistent with the results by Xue et al.[17]. 

In summary, we have use high-temperature STM, RHEED and RAS to examine the GaAs 

(001) surface. We find the surface to contain several different coexisting reconstructions. These 

reconstructions  are  all  derived  fundamentally  from  the  ζ(4x2)  structure.  The  mixed  surface  is 

consistent  with  electron  counting  rules  and  also  agrees  with  X-ray  and  RHEED  rocking-curve 

data.  It  will  be  very  instructive  to  examine  the  stability  of  these  reconstructions,  in  particular 

those with closed-shell Ga clusters, by density functional total energy calculations[18].

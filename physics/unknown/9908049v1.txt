INTRODUCTION

An experiment investigating the angle of Cerenkov light emitted by 3-MeV electrons

traversing an acrylic detector has been developed for use in the advanced physics laboratory course

at the University of Rochester.  In addition to exploring the experimental phenomena of Cerenkov

radiation and total internal reflection, the experiment introduces students to several experimental

techniques used in actual high energy and nuclear physics experiments, as well as to analysis

techniques involving Poisson statistics.

The interactions of very high energy charged particles with matter are usually investigated

using high-intensity beams generated by particle accelerators.  Most undergraduate students,

however, do not have access to beams from particle accelerators.  Sources of relativistic particles

which are readily available in undergraduate teaching labs include primarily cosmic ray muons and

electrons from radioactive beta decay.  While the rate of cosmic ray muons is very low and their

energy spectrum is wide, limiting their usefulness as a source of particles, the rate of high energy

electrons from radioactive sources can be high.  The experimental apparatus described here

generates an intense beam of monoenergetic electrons using the combination of a radioactive source

and a small permanent magnet beam line.  This “table-top” experiment enables students to study

fundamental interactions of high energy particles with matter, including such processes as

Cerenkov radiation, dE/dx energy loss in matter, and multiple Coulomb scattering.  Moreover, the

apparatus teaches several basic techniques of experimental particle physics paralleling the

techniques used in “real” experiments at major particle accelerator facilities.  In this

communication, we describe the construction and use of a table-top electron beam line in the study

of Cerenkov radiation.  An appendix contains supplier and cost information for apparatus

components.

PHOTON YIELD

A REVIEW OF CERENKOV RADIATION AND CALCULATION OF EXPECTED

The electric field of a charged particle moving in a given medium can propagate no faster

than that medium’s speed of light (c/n).  If a charged particle moves with velocity v greater than

the medium’s speed of light, the particle appears to emit a “shock-wave” of light at an angle to

the particle’s trajectory, as depicted in Fig. 1(a).  Fig. 1(b) indicates, for an electron, how to

determine the characteristic Cerenkov angle  .  After a time t, the particle has moved a distance vt,

and the electromagnetic field has traveled a distance of ct/n.  Wavelets (as conceptualized in

Huygen’s principle) form at each point along the trajectory and additively produce a wavefront at

right angles to the emitted photons.  The angle (or, more precisely, the half-angle) of Cerenkov

light 

  is determined by the relation

cos =
  

=

c

vn

n

,

where   = v/c.  This formula implies that Cerenkov light is produced only when v > c/n and

allows the expected Cerenkov cone angle to be predicted if v (or   ) and n are known.  Using the

mass-energy relationship E2=p2c2 + m2c4 we can find the electron’s  .  In the case of a 3-MeV

electron, for instance,

 = [1-(me/E)2]1/2 = [1-(0.511/3) 2]1/2 = 0.985 .

Thus, for n = 1.49 and 

 = 0.985, the Cerenkov angle is 

 = 47.0(cid:176) .

The approximate number of visible-spectrum photons produced by the charged particle,

as it traverses the length (L) of the dielectric medium, is given by1

Np = 400L(sin )2.

For a material of thickness 0.156 cm and 

 = 47.0(cid:176) , the approximate number of visible photons is

34.  Such low levels of Cerenkov light requires the use of a photo-multiplier tube (PMT) to detect

the photons emitted by the electron.  In this experiment, a polished piece of acrylic is used to

direct the photons into the PMT by total internal reflection.  The PMT used is sensitive only to

visible wavelengths, so Eq. (3) is valid.

Starting with 34 photons and an average quantum efficiency of 5% (over the entire visible

range of a typical bi-alkali PMT), the expected number of photo-electrons exiting the photocathode

is about 1.7.  The amount of detectable light will be smaller if additional losses are incurred:

losses due to light attenuation in the acrylic (about 30%, depending on the path-length to the

PMT, or about 13.7 cm for this setup); losses at the interface between the PMT and the detector

(about 20%); and losses due to poor optical machining of the surfaces.  Therefore, if the entire

angular cone of Cerenkov light is within the geometrical acceptance of the PMT, the expected

number of photo-electrons is about 1.0.  If the PMT does not accept the entire Cerenkov angular

cone, the number of photo-electrons will be smaller.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

There are five components to this experiment: the 3 MeV Ruthenium beta source beam

line2, the acrylic Cerenkov radiation detector and PMT, the triggering system, the CAMAC

computer interface3 and software, and the light-tight box.  Each of these components is discussed

in the following subsections.  A functional schematic of the setup is shown in Fig. 2.

Ruthenium beta source and beam line

The ruthenium (atomic number 44) isotope of atomic weight 106 (Ru-106) emits

electrons via beta decay with an energy spectrum up to 3.541 MeV.  In the experimental setup,

electrons emitted by the Ru-106 source enter a beam line2 comprised of two dipole and three

quadrupole permanent magnet sections.  By forcing the emitted electrons to bend through an angle

3

(dependent on electron momentum) and selecting those which bend at 90-degrees, the beam line

effectively selects only 3-MeV (– 5%) electrons and directs them toward the scintillation counters.

For a 4-millicurie Ru-106 beta source, the beam line delivers about 50 electrons per second.  The

beam line can be used with or without a vacuum to reduce multiple scattering.  No vacuum was

used in this experiment.

Acrylic  Cerenkov radiation detector

The detector is a polished bar of acrylic or poly-methyl-methacralate (PMMA), with

dimensions 32.5 cm x 5.0 cm x 0.156 cm.  In developing this experiment, we have used an

ultraviolet-transmitting acrylic (UVT), but because the PMT is not UV-sensitive, an ultraviolet-

absorbing acrylic (UVA) could be used instead.  As shown in Fig. 3(a), one end of the acrylic bar

is glued into a mounting disk (called a “cookie”), while the other end is painted black and

wrapped in black tape to reduce the amount of spurious light reflected into the PMT.  The acrylic

bar is covered with black plastic to prevent scratches and then secured to a metal support to

prevent it from bending under its weight [Fig. 3(b)].  The support and cookie are attached with

tape to a PMT [Fig. 4(a)], and a magnetic shield is placed around the PMT [Fig. 4(b)].

The output signal of the PMT is generated by applying a  high voltage to the anode and

cathode of the PMT.  The fourteen stage PMT (Amperex 56 AVP) is biased at 1.8 kV and has a

maximum voltage limit of 2.5 kV.

Acrylic has an index of refraction of 1.49 for visible light4.  Because the refractive index of

air is 1, total internal reflection occurs when the angle of the incident light ray is equal to or

greater than 42.2(cid:176) .  When a relativistic electron (v  c) passes through the acrylic bar, it produces a

cone of light, due to the Cerenkov effect.  The light intensity profile of the cone of light can be

mapped by varying the angle of the acrylic bar in relation to the path of the electron beam.  For

different angles, a larger or smaller fraction of the Cerenkov light may be captured by total internal

reflection and, hence, detected by the PMT.  This effect is illustrated in Fig. 5.

4

Event trigger

An “event” occurs when an electron passes through the Cerenkov detector and the

scintillation counters.  Each scintillation counter is comprised of a plastic scintillating plate and a

PMT, as shown in Fig. 2.  The PMT output signal is carried by a coaxial cable into a

discriminator.  The (nearly) simultaneous detection of an electron in both scintillation counters

generates an event trigger signal which activates the computerized data acquisition system.

Figure 6 shows the electronic components and logic used to generate an event trigger

signal.  Two discriminators convert the top and bottom PMT signals into NIM logic signals

(-0.7 or 0 V).  When the PMT output voltage falls below a preset value, the discriminator sends

out a -0.7 V pulse for a preset duration (typically 20 nanoseconds). The top and bottom

discriminators connect to a logical “AND” gate that generates a signal when both top and bottom

signals are nonzero.  A successful “AND” signal generates the trigger, indicating the coincident

firing of the top and bottom discriminators and detection of an electron in both scintillation

counters.  The trigger signal “turns on” the computerized data acquisition system by activating an

analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that digitizes the signal from the Cerenkov PMT for a preset

time duration or “trigger pulse duration.”  The trigger pulse duration is chosen to maximize the

signal-to-noise ratio of the converted signal; a duration of 70 nsec was used in developing this

experiment.

Because the transit time of the signal in each PMT may be different by a few

nanoseconds, it is necessary to delay the signals appropriately so that all signals reach the logic

electronics at the same time.  To account for internal delay, the cable for the top counter is longer

than the cable for the bottom counter.  This allows the signals from both counters to reach the

“AND” gate at the same time.  Likewise, the Cerenkov PMT signal is delayed to allow the signal

to arrive within the ADC gatewidth (that is, the trigger pulse duration).  After the cable lengths

have been properly selected, the experiment is “timed-in” and ready to take data.

5

Once analog-to-digital conversion of the Cerenkov PMT signal is complete, the digitized

level of electric charge (corresponding to the amount of light captured in the PMT) is recorded in a

computerized data file for analysis.  This experiment uses a LeCroy 2249A ADC with a resolution

of 10 bits, or 1024 distinct charge levels.  The amount of Cerenkov light for a detected event is

represented in the data file by a number from 0 to 1023, corresponding to the ADC charge level.

Software

A simple data acquisition program has been written in Turbo Pascal for an IBM

compatible computer with CAMAC 6001 interface card.  The program, called CERENKOV, uses

standard CAMAC interface commands to read data from the ADC module on the CAMAC crate.

A user can either collect data for a specified number of events or for a specified time period.  The

data files may be viewed with any text editor and may be analyzed to determine the number of

detected photo-electrons.  The documentation for the CAMAC card describes the command syntax

for different programming languages.

Light-tight box

The light-tight box contains the controls, equipment, and radioactive source necessary to

test the acrylic Cerenkov detector and scintillation counters.  Here, “light-tight” means that no

light can enter the box when the lid is latched shut.  This feature protects the PMT’s from high

current damage while the high voltage power supply is energized.

As mentioned earlier, the Ru-106 radioactive source emits beta radiation (electrons) with

an energy spectrum up to 3.5-MeV, and the subsequent beam line structure 2 selects 3-MeV

electrons and directs them down through the scintillation counters.  A support placed within the

box holds the Cerenkov detector at a fixed angle to the electron beam.  As shown in Fig. 7, a ring

bolt allows the experimenter to vary the angle of the detector in relation to the beam.  The

detector-to-beam angle 

 can be measured with a plumb line and protractor.

6

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

The objective of this experiment is for the student to determine how the amount of

Cerenkov light collected in the PMT varies with the detector-to-beam angle, and to compare the

result to predictions based on theory and information about the apparatus.  To do this, the student

collects data in sets or “runs,” each of which corresponds to a different detector-to-beam angle 

.

For each data run, 100 to 1000 events (described in the previous section) are recorded in a

computer file.  By using methods described in the next section, the student can determine the

average number of photo-electrons per event trigger, which is proportional to the amount of

Cerenkov radiation.  Finally, the student prepares a plot of the average number of photo-electrons

versus the detector-to-beam angle 

.

DATA ANALYSIS

The following analysis is used to calculate the number of  photo-electrons detected by the

Cerenkov PMT.  As stated in the “Review of Cerenkov Radiation” above, the expected number of

photo-electrons is about 1.0 if the entire angular cone of Cerenkov light is within the geometrical

acceptance of the PMT.  If the PMT does not accept the entire Cerenkov angular cone, the number

of  photo-electrons will be smaller.  The first step is to distinguish pedestal from non-pedestal

events.  The ADC “pedestal” refers to the “zero” level of the detected light and corresponds to the

ADC level (i.e., 0-1023) with the largest number of events.  For a Poisson distribution, if the

average number of  photo-electrons is N, then e-N is the probability that no photo-electrons are

detected.  The number of photo-electrons  N and the error D

 are defined in Eqs. (4) and (5),

respectively:

The number of photons produced is proportional to the length of the electron’s path in the acrylic

bar.  As the detector-to-beam angle ( ) increases, the electron’s path-length also increases as

1/Cos(a

).  Consequently, the number of  photo-electrons must be corrected to account for the

longer path-length and corresponding addition of photons.  This is accomplished by multiplying

Eq. 4 by Cos(a

).

To improve the accuracy of the experiment and provide a more realistic learning

experience regarding high energy physics experiments, students may be asked to correct the

number of photo-electrons due to background and other effects, as described below.

Cosmic ray background

The experimenter may investigate background events from cosmic rays (muons coming

from the upper atmosphere).  To study the cosmic ray background, it is necessary to record two

sets of data for each detector-to-beam angle.  For the first data set, the experimenter places the

detector beneath the electron beam line and collects data normally for a fixed amount of time.  For

the second data set, the experimenter blocks the electron beam line with a lead plate while

collecting data.  Because the lead plate blocks the electrons from the Ru-106 source, the

scintillation counters trigger only on cosmic ray events.  The ADC spectrum produced by cosmic

rays can be subtracted from the normal spectrum (which results from the sum of Cerenkov and

cosmic ray events) before estimating the number of photo-electrons.

Multiple scattering

 (5)

In the above formulae, the electron’s path through the acrylic is assumed to be straight.

Multiple scattering, however, may cause the electron to deviate from the original trajectory.  This

deviation tends to blur the angular dependence of Cerenkov light, so it is important to calculate

the expected angular deviation for an electron.  The average root-mean-square (rms) multiple

scattering angle5 in radians is given by Eq. (7):

where z is charge of the particle, p is the particle’s momentum, v is the particle’s velocity, t is the

thickness of the material through which the particle is moving, and X0 is the radiation length of

material.  Eq. (7) gives the total rms angle in space for multiple scattering in the x and y planes.

If a 3-MeV electron (v/c close to 1.0) travels through acrylic, the rms multiple scattering angle is

27(cid:176) , given t = 0.1563 cm, X0=34.4 cm, z = 1, and pv = 3 MeV (see reference 6).  This rms

angular deviation is about half of the Cerenkov angle (about 47(cid:176) ), which would cause considerable

error in the measurement.  Fortunately, the trigger system selects well-collimated electrons with

actual deviations of only a few degrees or those electrons which have scattered out and then back

into the beam line.

Spurious photons reflected into the PMT

Black paint and tape are used to prevent reflected light from reaching the PMT, as shown

in Fig. 3.  However, the present detector configuration may not stop all reflections.  A better

configuration is to cut the end of the acrylic bar at a 45(cid:176)  angle and then paint it black, as shown in

Fig. 8.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

This experiment has been conducted for positive and negative detector-to-beam angles

(

), and the Cerenkov light profile is plotted in Fig. 9.  The amount of light detected by the

(7)

9

PMT can be seen to vary with the angle of the acrylic bar.  For a 3-MeV electron, the calculated

Cerenkov angle   is 47.0(cid:176) .  Due to the acrylic-air interface, the critical angle for total internal

reflection is 42.2(cid:176) .  For normal incidence, the Cerenkov photons traveling in the direction of the

PMT would be trapped in the bar and detected.  If the incident angle is allowed to change, there

will be an angle for which total internal reflection does not trap the Cerenkov light in the direction

of the PMT.  If any light directed away from the PMT is trapped by total internal reflection, it is

then absorbed by the black paint at the end of the bar.  This total internal reflection cutoff angle is

approximately -5(cid:176) .  This means that the number of  photo-electrons detected should increase as 

is increased, and no light should be detected for 

 < -5(cid:176) .

The general shape of the graph conforms to this expectation, but light is detected for 

 <

-5(cid:176) .  Several factors may account for the detection of light even when the detector-to-beam angle 

is less than the cutoff for total internal reflection.  First, the experimental model does not account

for blemishes and scratches on the acrylic bar.  Scratches cause scattering of photons, potentially

destroying the angular dependence of the Cerenkov radiation.  Second, reflection of light from the

edges of the acrylic bar could cause light to be detected for 

  < -5(cid:176) .  Third, if the bar of acrylic

were to bend under its own weight, the angular dependence of the Cerenkov light again would be

affected.  (We note that the data reported here were taken with an early version of the experiment;

the current setup includes support structures to prevent sagging.)  Fourth, cosmic ray background

could produce detectable light for angles < -5(cid:176) .  Fifth, multiple scattering could result in small

deviations in angular dependence.  It is left to the student to investigate these possible sources of

background and try to improve the experimental setup.

Several further studies are possible with this experimental setup:

1.  Students may estimate the expected number of photo-electrons more precisely and derive the

average quantum efficiency of the PMT.

10

2.  After determining the angle which maximizes the Cerenkov light yield, students may measure

the attenuation length of the light in acrylic by varying the distance between the point at

which the electron beam crosses the acrylic bar and the PMT.

3.  Students may write a Monte Carlo simulation program, which includes multiple scattering

and other effects, to reproduce the plot of detected light versus angle.

4.  The experiment may be modified by replacing the acrylic bar with a thin scintillator.  A thin

scintillation counter yields a large number of photo-electrons for a minimum ionizing particle

traversing the scintillator.  Data analysis could then include a study of Landau energy-loss by

electrons and cosmic ray muons passing through matter.

CONCLUSION

The Cerenkov effect is a fascinating physical phenomenon which provides an important

experimental technique for the detection and counting of high energy, charged particles.  The

experiment described here engages students with relativistic kinematics, optical phenomena,

scintillation light, photo-electron production, and the Cerenkov effect.

In addition, students are introduced to instruments and techniques frequently used in high

energy experiments. The electron beam line replicates, on a small scale, the beam lines used at

major particle accelerators.  The relatively high rate of beta production from the Ru-106 source (50

electrons per second) allows students to “time-in” the fast-logic electronics on an oscilloscope,

perform timing studies, and run a variety of systematic checks.  The students work with electronic

logic circuits, photo-multiplier tubes, and computerized data acquisition systems.  The data

analysis requires Poisson statistics and an investigation of systematic errors, which in turn deal

with fundamental physical processes and ordinary physical phenomena such as multiple scattering

and cosmic rays.  The experiment may be extended to include studies of the quantum efficiency of

photo-multiplier tubes and Landau energy loss processes.  The experiment is also amenable to

computerized simulation, allowing closer examination of many of the phenomena it presents.

APPENDIX

The electron beam line was designed according to the general specifications described in

reference 2.  Figure 10 shows a side and bottom view of the beam line as it was designed at

Rochester.  The beam line uses 3 quadrupole magnet structures (comprised of 8 magnets) and 2

dipole magnet structures (comprised of  6 magnets).  The size and shape of the ceramic magnets

are shown in Figure 11.  A necessary design feature is the ability to adjust the magnet positions

around the beam line.  This allows one to better focus the electron beam when assembling the

beam line from commercial permanent magnets with small variations in field strength.  The

bending magnets are attached to the mounting plates with screws which go into radial slots.  The

quadrupole magnets are assembled around the beam pipe, and are therefore movable in the

longitudinal direction along the beam line.

The electron beam line traverses a 90 degree bend which is approximately circular.  The

bending magnet active area is triangular, which can be used to change the path-length of the

electrons in the magnetic field.  If the magnet is moved to a larger radius, the electrons traverse a

shorter length in the magnetic field, thus selecting a higher electron beam energy.  Selection of a

higher beam energy results in a lower rate of electrons

There are two methods to construct the beam line.  In the first method, one can either

measure the field of each magnet and position the magnet according to the desired beam energy.

This method is time consuming and required the use of a Hall probe.  If knowledge of the precise

beam energy is not needed, one can fix the radial location of the first bending magnet, and vary the

radial location of the second magnet until the beam rate is maximized.  If the beam rate is

12

measured using a radiation monitor or a Geiger counter, the beam line can be set up in about 10

minutes.

It is assumed that most laboratories have a computer which can be used for the data

acquisition system.  The CAMAC system that has been used in our setup is not specifically

required, and any computer with a standard analog to digital conversion card will work.  The

software used in our setup is available on the WWW at  http://www.pas.rochester.edu/ug.html

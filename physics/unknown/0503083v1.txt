Abstract: Flow instability and turbulent transition can be well explained using a new proposed 
theory--Energy gradient theory [1]. In this theory, the stability of a flow depends on the relative 
magnitude of energy gradient in streamwise direction and that in transverse direction, if there is 
no work input. In this note, it is shown based on the energy gradient theory that inviscid non-
uniform flow is unstable if the energy in transverse direction is not constant. This new finding 
breaks  the  classical  linear  theory  from  Rayleigh  that  inviscid  flow  is  unstable  if  the  velocity 
profile has an inflection point in parallel flows and inviscid flow is stable if the velocity profile 
has no inflection point in parallel flow. Then, stability of rotating viscous and inviscid flows is 
studied, and two examples of rotating flows (rotating rigid body motion and free vortex motion) 
are shown, respectively.

Stability of laminar flows  
Transition to turbulence  
Instability of shear flows 

Viscous instability  

 

 

 
In the classical theory for flow instability, Rayleigh (1880)[2] first developed a general 
linear  stability  theory  for  inviscid  plane-parallel  shear  flows,  and  showed  that  a  necessary 
condition  for  instability  is  that  the  velocity  profile  has  a  point  of  inflection.  Later,  Tollmien 
(1935)  succeeded  in  showing  that  this  also  constitutes  a  sufficient  condition  for  the 
amplification of disturbances [3]. Fjφrtoft (1950) gave a further necessary condition for inviscid 
instability, that there is a maximum of vorticity for instability [4]. Therefore, it is well known 
that  inviscid  flow  with  inflectional  velocity  profile  is  unstable,  while  inviscid  flow  with  no 
inflectional  velocity  profile  is  stable  [5-8].    The  associated  analysis  showed  that  the  effect  of 
viscosity  is  complex,  and  it  plays  dual  roles  to  the  flow  instability.  Recently,  Dou  (2002)  [1] 
proposed  a  new  theory  for  flow  instability  and  turbulent  transition—energy  gradient  theory. 
This  new  theory  obtains  good  consistent  results  with  the  experiments  for  parallel  flows  and 
Taylor-Couette flows between two rotating cylinders. Using this theory, it is demonstrated that

parallel  shear  flows  with  inflectional  velocity  profile  for  two-dimensional  and  axisymmetrical 
viscous flows are sufficient for instability [9]. On further studying the classical linear theory, it 
is found that there are some contradictions to the experimental results in this theory and these 
could  not  be  reasonably  explained  so  far.  In  this  paper,  the  energy  gradient  theory  is  used  to 
study the stability of rotating  viscous  and inviscid flows. It is demonstrated that inviscid  non-
uniform  flow  is  unstable  if  the  energy  in  transverse  direction  is  not  constant.  This  result 
overthrows  the  classical  Rayleigh theorem on instability of inflectional  velocity profile. Then, 
stability  of  rotating  viscous  and  inviscid  flows  is  studied,  and  two  examples  of  rotating  flows 
(rotating rigid body motion and free vortex motion) are shown, respectively.  
 
2. Energy gradient theory 
 
 
Recently,  Dou  [1]  proposed  an  energy  gradient  theory  with  the  aim  to  clarify  the 
mechanism of transition from laminar to turbulence for wall bounded shear flows. Here, we give 
a short discussion for a better understanding of the work presented in this study. In the theory, 
the whole flow field is treated as an energy field. It is thought that the gradient of total energy in 
the  transverse  direction  of  the  main  flow  and  the  viscous  friction  in  the  streamwise  direction 
dominate the instability phenomena and hence the flow transition for a given disturbance. The 
energy  gradient  in  the  transverse  direction  has  the  potential  to  amplify  a  velocity  disturbance, 
while the viscous friction loss in the streamwise direction can resist and absorb this disturbance. 
The flow instability or the transition to turbulence  depends on the relative magnitude of these 
two  roles  of  energy  gradient  amplification  and  viscous  friction  damping  to  the  initial 
disturbance. Based on such, a new dimensionless parameter, K (the ratio of the energy gradient 
in  the  transverse  direction  to  that  in  the  streamwise  direction),  is  defined  to  characterize  the 
stability of the base flow,

coordinate  in  the  direction  of  gravitational  field,  n  denotes  the  direction  normal  to  the 
streamwise direction and s denotes the streamwise direction. Furthermore, ρ is the fluid density, 
g is the gravity acceleration, V is the velocity, and p is the hydrodynamic pressure. For pressure 
driven flows, the magnitude of energy gradient 
 equals to the energy loss of unit volume 
 in unit length along the streamline due to the viscous friction. In other word, the 
fluid 
mechanism  of  generation  of  streamwise  energy  gradient  is  resulted  by  the  energy  loss  due  to 
viscous friction (Fig.1). Therefore, for shear driven flows, the calculation of K can be obtained 
by  the  ratio  of  the  energy  gradient  in  transverse  direction  and  the  energy  loss  in  unit  length 
along the streamline [10],

As  such,  the  parameter  K  in  Eq.(1)  is  a  field  variable.  Thus,  the  distribution  of  K  in  the  flow 
field  and  the  property  of  disturbance  may  be  the  perfect  means  to  describe  the  disturbance 
amplification or decay in the flow. It is suggested that the flow instability can first occur at the 
position  of  maxK
 which  is  construed  to  be  the  most  “dangerous”  position.    Thus,  for  a  given 
disturbance,  the  occurrence  of  instability  depends  on  the  magnitude  of  this  dimensionless 
parameter K  and  the  critical  condition is determined by  the  maximum  value  of  K  in the flow.

For  a  given  flow  geometry  and  fluid  properties,  when  the  maximum  of  K  in  the  flow  field  is 
cK ,  it  is  expected  that  instability  can  occur  for  certain  initial 
larger  than  a  critical  value 
disturbance  [1].  Turbulence  transition  is  a  local  phenomenon  in  the  earlier  stage.  For  a  given 
flow,  K  is  proportional  to  the  global  Reynolds  number.  A  large  value  of  K  has  the  ability  to 
amplify  the  disturbance,  and  vice  versa.  The  analysis  has  suggested  that  the  transition  to 
turbulence is due to the energy gradient and the disturbance amplification, rather than just the 
linear eigenvalue instability type as stated in [11,12]; this also follows that  the pipe Poiseuille 
flow is linearly stable for all the Reynolds number. Both Grossmann [11] and Trefethen et al. 
[12]  commented  that  the  nature  of  the  onset-of-turbulence  mechanism  in  parallel  shear  flows 
must be different from an eigenvalue instability of linear equations of small disturbance. In fact, 
finite  disturbance  is  needed  for  the  turbulence  initiation  in  the  range  of  finite  Re  as  found  in 
experiments [13]. Dou [1] demonstrated that the criterion obtained has a consistent value at the 
subcritical condition of transition determined by the experimental data for plane Poiseuille flow, 
pipe Poiseuille flow  as well as plane Couette flow. From this  table it can  be  deduced that the 
cK  at  about  385  for  both the 
turbulence  transition takes place at a  consistent  critical  value  of 
plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow, and about 370 for plane Couette flow. This may 
cK ≈ 370-385. 
suggest that the subcritical transition in parallel flows takes place at a value of 
The finding further suggests that the flow instability is likely resulted from the action of energy 
gradients,  and  not  due  strictly  to  the  eigenvalue  instability  of  linear  equations.  The  critical 
condition for flow instability as determined by linear stability analysis differs largely from the 
experimental data for all the three different types of flows. Using energy gradient theory, it is 
also demonstrated that the viscous flow with an inflectional velocity profile is unstable for both 
two-dimensional flow and axisymmetrical (Fig.2)[9].  
 
For  plane  Poiseuille  flow,  this  said  position  where  Kmax>  Kc  should  then  be  the  most 
dangerous  location  for  flow  breakdown,  which  has  been  confirmed  by  Nishioka  et  al’s 
experiment  [14].  The  measured  instantaneous  velocity  distributions  indicate  that  the  first 
oscillation of the velocity occurs at y/h=0.50~0.62.

For  pipe  flow,  in  a  recent  study,  Wedin  and  Kerswell  [15]  showed  that  there  is  the 
 
presence  of  the  "shoulder"  in  the  velocity  profile  at  about  r/R=0.6  from  their  solution  of  the 
traveling waves. The  location  of the "shoulder" is about same  as that for  maxK
. According to 
the present theory, this "shoulder" may then be intricately related to the distribution of energy 
gradient. The solution of traveling waves has been confirmed by experiments recently [16].  
 
As mentioned above, the mechanism for instability described by the parameter K is that 
it  represents  the  balance  of  two  roles  of  disturbance  amplification  by  the  energy  gradient  in 
transverse direction and disturbance damping by the energy loss in streamwise direction. 
 
3. Stability of Viscous Rotating Flows  
 
 
For rotating flows with axisymmetry, the energy gradient in circumferential direction is 
zero. The fluid flow is driven by external work input, otherwise the fluid is static. In this case 
the denominate in Eq.(1) is calculated by Eq.(2). 
 
streamline for rotating axisymmetric flow has been obtained as [17],

The stability of the flow depends on the magnitude of this parameter K. 
 
4. Stability of Inviscid Rotating flows  
 
 
For  inviscid  flows,  if  there  is  no  work  input,  the  total  energy  along  the  streamline  is 
constant.  Thus,  the  total  energy  gradient  in  the  streamwise  direction  for  inviscid  fluid  is  zero, 
sE
/
∂
. We can find that K is infinite from Eq.(1) if the total energy is not constant in the 
transverse  direction.  According  to  the  energy  gradient  theory,  the  flow  is  unstable  at  this 
condition. For shear driven flows with work input (including rotating flows), the energy loss in 
streamwise direction for inviscid flows is zero. If the energy gradient in transverse direction is 
not zero, the flow will be unstable; if the energy gradient in transverse direction is zero, the flow 
stability in indefinite. At this case the flow stability depends on the disturbance.

Therefore, the stability of free-vortex flow of inviscid fluid is indefinite. At this case, the flow 
stability  depends  on  the  disturbance.  If  there  is  no  disturbance,  the  flow  is  stable.  If  the 
disturbance is sufficient large, the flow will be unstable. 
 
 
7. Conclusions 
 
 
In energy gradient theory, sufficient large value of transversal energy gradient has the 
tendency to amplify a disturbance and may lead to flow instability. Streamwise energy loss tries 
to  damp  the  disturbance  and  delay  the  instability.  A  dimensionless  field  variable  K  is  used  to 
characterize  the  relative  magnitude  of  disturbance  amplification  and  damping  as  well  as  the 
extent of instability. When the maximum of K in the flow field is larger than a critical value Kc, 
it is expected that the instability occurs.   
 
In  this  paper,  the  energy  gradient  theory  is  used  to  study  the  stability  of  viscous  and 
inviscid  rotating  flows.  It  is  demonstrated  that  inviscid  non-uniform  flow  is  unstable  if  the 

 

 

 

7

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

energy gradient in transverse direction is not zero. This result overthrows the classical Rayleigh 
theorem on instability of inflectional velocity profile in parallel flow. Then, stability of rotating 
viscous  and  inviscid  flows  is  studied,  and  stability  of  two  typical  examples  of  rotating  flows 
(rotating rigid body motion and free vortex motion) are shown, respectively. It is demonstrated 
that both of the viscous flow and inviscid flow of rigid body motion are unstable. The viscous 
flow of free vortex motion is always stable. The stability of free-vortex flow of inviscid fluid is 
indefinite. At this case, the flow stability depends on the disturbance. If there is no disturbance, 
the flow is stable. If the disturbance is sufficient large, the flow will be unstable.

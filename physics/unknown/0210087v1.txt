This review was conducted through the Lighting Transformations Program of the Lighting 
Research Center (LRC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and was supported by the New York 
State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). Rachel Winters, NYSERDA 
Project Manager, oversaw the review. Mariana Figueiro is the Director of the Lighting 
Transformations Program. Suzanne Hayes of the LRC performed bibliographic searches for the 
materials described in this review. John Bullough of the LRC and Margaret Suozzo of the 
American Countil for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) prepared this summary. 
 
PURPOSE 
 
A primary purpose of this review is to identify and summarize recently published information 
about the use and performance of light-emitting diode (LED) traffic signals. It consists of two 
sections: a synopsis of experiences of municipalities using LED traffic signals in 1999 and 2000, 
and a discussion of technical, economic and market issues surrounding the deployment of LED 
signals. This review includes articles and reports published in 1999 and 2000. 
 
EXPERIENCE WITH LED TRAFFIC SIGNALS 
 
Table 1 summarizes articles that describe installations of LED traffic signals at various locations 
throughout the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. This table treats the articles as 
responses to a hypothetical survey with the following questions: 
 
•  Where and when were LED traffic signals installed? 
•  How many LED signals were installed? 
•  What is the cost of LED signals?  
•  What financial assistance was available? 
•  Were energy savings experienced (or are they anticipated)? 
•  Were maintenance savings experiences (or are they anticipated)? 
•  What are the potential barriers to using LED signals? 
 
Of the municipalities represented that described the LED signal colors being installed, 78% were 
installing red signals, 56% were installing green, and 11% were installing yellow signals (here 
and elsewhere in this summary, totals may add to more than 100% because some of the 
hypothetical questions above can have multiple answers). Of the municipalities installing green 
signals, 40% of them had previously installed red, or red and orange pedestrian signals. Half of 
the municipalities (50%) were installing LEDs in a significant number of their signals (10 or

more intersections), and 30% were installing much smaller numbers of LED signals, often in just 
one or two intersections. These results seem to indicate a trend from previous years toward a 
greater use of green LED traffic signals and a greater penetration of LED signals overall. 
 
There was a high recognition of the potential economic benefits of using LED traffic signals in 
the articles that were reviewed. Energy savings were cited by 80%, and maintenance savings by 
90% of the municipalities. The ability to quantify (even if only crudely) these savings was 
demonstrated by 81% of the municipalities citing energy savings, and by 78% of those citing 
maintenance savings. This also seems to indicate a growing trend; typically, maintenance savings 
especially have been more difficult for municipalities to recognize and quantify (Conway and 
Bullough, 1999). Still, there was wide variation in reported “pay-back” periods, ranging from 1.5 
years to more than 7 years. 
 
Just under one third of the municipalities (30%) reported receiving some sort of financial 
assistance in their LED traffic signal programs. Half (50%) of these involved grants or other 
assistance from utilities, 50% involved assistance from other government agencies, and 17% was 
in the form of assistance from an energy service company. 
 
More than one third (35%) of the municipalities cited potential barriers to more widespread use 
of LED traffic signals, and most of these (86%) were barriers associated with the very high 
initial cost of LED signals (in general, red LED signal heads were reported to cost around $100 
and green heads about twice this amount). The only technological barriers cited (by 14% of those 
citing any potential barriers) were limitations of LEDs with respect to the yellow signals, which 
require much higher luminous intensities than red and green signals in North America. 
 
OTHER ISSUES SURROUNDING LED TRAFFIC SIGNAL USE 
 
Visibility issues 
In June 1998, the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) published its interim specification 
for LED traffic signal heads (ITE, 1998). The specification describes minimum luminous 
intensities of red, green and yellow signal heads and is based largely on the ITE’s older existing 
specification for incandescent signals (ITE, 1985), but with a 15% across-the-board decrease in 
luminous intensity from the incandescent levels. In the ITE specifications, luminous intensities 
for green and yellow signals are higher than for the red signals. This differs from the approach 
taken by European nations and by Japan where all three signal colors are given the same 
luminous intensity. Recent research (Bullough et al., 2000) indicates that for daytime viewing, 
signal visibility (e.g., response time and missed signals) is consistent with a requirement 
stipulating higher intensities for the green and yellow signals than for red signals. 
 
The same study also indicates that for daytime viewing, there is no significant visibility 
difference between incandescent and LED traffic signals having the same nominal color and 
luminous intensity. The ITE will affirm or revise its interim standard in the coming months based 
on the results of a study funded by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program 
(NCHRP) and on other relevant research, perhaps including the results of Bullough et al. (2000). 
It has also been acknowledged that the faster onset times of LED signals compared to 
incandescent signals might be of benefit for signaling applications (Howe, 2000).

Technical issues 
Key technical issues of concern to municipalities is how LED signals perform in actual 
installations. A number of technical challenges facing LED signals have been completely or 
partially overcome: these range from flicker to controller compatibility to lumen maintenance. 
 
Most of the LED traffic signal market to date has consisted of retrofits designed to fit into 
existing incandescent signal lamp sockets. However, unique characteristics of LEDs may bring 
about opportunities for developments in new LED traffic signal systems. When viewed at night, 
for example, signals having very high intensity can result in discomfort or disability glare that 
impedes visibility. Feedback-controlled systems to reduce signal intensity at night or during 
overcast days have proven problematic with incandescent traffic signals because dimming an 
incandescent lamp also changes its color, and could create confusion to drivers about the color of 
a traffic signal. LEDs, on the other hand, do not significantly change in color when dimmed, and 
systems have been developed to take advantage of this potential (Johnstone, 1999). Another 
possible advantage of LED technology with respect to traffic control devices is the relative ease 
with which communication elements such as animation (Van Houten et al., 1999), differing 
signal shapes (Anonymous, 1999n), and other options can be incorporated into signal designs 
(Pang et al., 1999; Tam et al., 1999). Such concepts, however, are not likely to find widespread 
use in many jurisdictions because traffic signals generally have highly standardized 
specifications; novel (and largely untested) configurations are not encouraged. Some 
municipalities, such as Philadelphia, PA (Suozzo, 2000), are encouraging new developments in 
LED traffic signal systems, such as three-color LED signals, through incentives to 
manufacturers. 
 
Recent developments in LED traffic signal technology that could possibly encourage its more 
widespread use in the future include improvements in manufacturing processes for green and 
blue LEDs (Ranii, 1999; Reucroft and Swain, 2000) that can reduce production costs, and 
developments of durable plastic lens materials that are able to withstand large variations in 
temperature and severe levels of solar radiation (Anonymous, 2000d). 
 
Economic issues 
Certainly, municipalities have been challenged by the high initial cost of LED traffic signals and, 
in response, several electric utilities offer rebates or other financial incentives to municipalities 
for LED traffic signal installations. Declining prices are helping to overcome this barrier 
(Suozzo, 1999; Suozzo et al., 2000). Several electric utilities have programs by which they offer 
rebates or other financial assistance for municipalities using LED traffic signals (CEE, 1999; 
Howe, 2000). Energy service companies, sometimes in partnership with LED signal 
manufacturers and financial institutions, have also begun working with municipalities to finance 
installation of LED signals with leases paid back through energy and maintenance savings 
(Anonymous, 1999o, 1999p). Such savings have been documented by organizations such as the 
Consortium for Energy Efficiency (CEE) and ACEEE (Suozzo, 1999; Anonymous, 2000e, 
2000f). For example, the 7-year life cycle cost for incandescent versus LED red traffic signals is 
$288 for incandescent signals, compared to $154 for LED signals. Break-even points for green 
LED signals are estimated to be longer than for red LEDs (Anonymous, 2000g).

SUMMARY 
 
Use of LED traffic signals is growing, with greater penetration of not only red, but also green 
LED signals in greater proportion than previously reported. There appears to be growing 
acceptance of LEDs as viable light sources for traffic signals, and a growing awareness of the 
potential maintenance and energy savings achievable with LEDs, but specific tools to quantify 
such potential savings are still lacking. Providing such tools to agencies considering the use of 
LED traffic signals, and disseminating documented savings and long-term performance data, 
based on actual installations, would help reduce perceived risks (Suozzo et al., 2000) associated 
with this technology. 
 
In addition, there are a number of programmatic activities that have taken shape over the last 
couple of years, specifically the establishment of a national utility initiative by CEE to help 
coordinate utility promotion efforts, the development of a draft specification through the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency's and the U.S. Department of Energy's ENERGY STAR 
program (Suozzo et al., 2000).

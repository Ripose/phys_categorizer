A balance is described with Langmuir binding of weights to each side. This 

simple physical system, when coupled with a previously derived equation for the 

equivalent displacement of weight that perturbs the equilibrium of a balance, models two-

state, receptor systems in pharmacology for receptor activation. Surprisingly, this system 

also shows desensitization similar to many drug-receptor systems. Although 

understanding the biophysics behind receptor signaling is an important endeavor by itself, 

this analogy with a simple balance may bring new insights into other areas of physics as 

well.

Our senses function through a distinct class of molecules known as G protein-

coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors sense our environment and control most of 

our physiology. They are targets for about one-third of modern drug development. The 

responses of many of these GPCRs to stimuli typically show hyperbolic, dose-response 

curves that approach a maximum value; peak and then decline back to baseline values. 

This phenomenon often appears as either normal or skewed bell-shaped, dose-response 

curves. Pharmacologists have named this decline towards baseline "desensitization" [1-

15].  Although many of the most important biological events show receptor 

desensitization, this phenomenon remains poorly understood [1-12]. Desensitization also 

appears counterintuitive by suggesting that more of an activating drug or molecule 

lessens the response. Therefore, it remains difficult for pharmacologists to reconcile how 

a molecule can both activate and deactivate those same receptors, often within a 

millisecond to microsecond time frame [12]. If there were a simple physical system that 

shows a similar response, it may offer important insights into this problem. 

A simple balance may offer such a physical system. The balance can be 

conceptualized to represent receptor equilibrium and has the additional advantage of 

revealing relationships between a physical and chemical, two-state equilibrium [14-16]. 

When a receptor chemically "senses" a hormone or drug molecule, the molecule binds 

preferentially to one state of the receptor  (or one side of the balance) and perturbs the 

initial receptor equilibrium (so that it is out of balance) [14,15]. This perturbation 

produces an induced shift in the initial receptor equilibrium toward the preferred binding 

state. This has the effect of enriching the population of the preferred receptor state. For a 

cellular signal to be transmitted, there must also exist a series of poised equilibria that 

transmit these perturbations from the external signals into intracellular messages.   

The quantifiable nature of this perturbation or shift is analogous to a previously 

derived equation for a weight, ∆w, that equivalently perturbs a balance in equilibrium, 

 

 

 

∆w =

S1w2
+ S1

− S2w1
+ w 2

+ S2

w1

                                                  (1) 

where S1 and S2 are the supplemental weights added to each side of a simple balance and 

w1 and w2 are the weights on the balance in an initial equilibrium before the addition of 

the supplemental weights [13].  The nature of ∆w provides a mechanism to calculate 

perturbations in similar two-state, equilibrium systems [13-15]. 

By introducing Langmuir binding equations for S1 and S2 into Equation (1), we 

can transform a balance into a biophysical receptor model that describes many aspects of 

drug-receptor interactions [13-16]. Letting w1 = R1, w2 = R2 where R1 and R2 represent 

the maximum amount of weight allowable for each side. Substituting the Langmuir 

binding expressions for the supplemental weights, S1=R1(S)/(S+K1), and 

S2=R2(S)/(S+K2) into equation (1), where K1 and K2 are the affinity constants for the 

two sides of the balance, and letting ∆w = ∆R yields, 

 ∆R =

R1R2(S)(K2

− K1)

R1(2S + K1)(S + K2 ) + R2 (S + K1)(2S + K 2)

 
                                 (2)

where ∆R represents the change in the amount of weight equivalent to the perturbation of 

the initial equilibrium by unequal (K1≠K2) molecular binding. This equation is identical 

to equation (6) in reference [14] that was originally derived for drug-receptor responses 

where "∆RH" represented the change in the initial receptor states.  

This model differs from other two-state receptor models in that the other models 

do not calculate the net change in the amount of the receptor that is shifted by the 

preferred binding. This is primarily because the other models do not make the net change 

in the shift an unknown variable that can be solved explicitly. This model corrects this 

problem by solving explicitly for the net shift, ∆R [13-15]. 

Previously, Equation (2) was used to model dose-response relationships in 

pharmacology [14,15]. However before this study, Equation (2) was not subjected to an 

experimental test with a physical balance. For the sake of inquiry, Equation (2) was tested 

with a simple two-pan balance. K1 and K2 were set equal to 10 g and 100 g respectively. 

They represent the unequal affinities (1/K1 and 1/K2) of each pan (A and B) for (S). R1 

and R2 were each set arbitrarily equal to 100 g, and the amount of (S) was allowed to 

vary up to 500 for this particular experiment. Note that for this demonstration (S) 

represents an amount of weight (or a concentration) potentially available for binding up 

to the saturating conditions of R1 and R2. It should be noted that the Langmuir binding 

equations for S1 and S2 allow a fraction of the available maximum weights R1 and R2 to 

weight pans A and B respectively (see Table 1). The Langmuir binding equations are 

plotted for S1 and S2 in Figure 1. As seen in Figure 1 and Table 1, the theory fits the 

experimental data for the balance very well.  

The insert in the upper right corner of Figure 1 is the theory plotted on a reverse 

axis with an expanded scale. From the physical point of view, the insert demonstrates the 

striking similarity to similar figures from the tracings of excitatory postsynaptic currents 

produced in neurons by the neurotransmitter, molecule glutamate [12], and similar 

pharmacological dose-response curves [4,10,14] (also see below). This demonstrates the 

similarity of response curves produced with this balance model to the nonlinear response 

curves that are ubiquitous in many complex cellular systems. Although this is an arbitrary 

physical system, it could easily be made more realistic by decreasing the constants K1 

and K2 to create a more realistic system for the binding of molecules to receptors on a 

cell surface [14, 15]. From a purely physical perspective, these observations suggest that 

suitable physical systems may be created to mimic the behaviors of the more complex 

biological ones.  

As a further example, Figure 2 shows the balance as a slightly more complicated 

but more realistic model for a hypothetical cellular receptor. The parameter, (S), 

represents the concentration of molecules in solution and ∆R is the theoretical response 

calculated by Equation (2). Also plotted in Figure 2 are the Langmuir binding plots for S1 

and S2 and the total binding on a logarithmic scale. Desensitization occurs in the presence 

of continued binding and is observed as a bell-shaped curve as seen for ∆R in Figure 2.  

Another interesting observation is that the response of the system occurs at only a 

fraction of the total binding (compare 50% ∆R response with the curve for S1+S2 in FIG. 

2). This has been called the phenomenon of "spare receptors" in pharmacology and has 

puzzled pharmacologists for many years. However, we can now see what produces the 

apparent spare receptor reserve. Since only a fraction of the receptor molecules (or 

weight in the case of the balance) is transferred as an equivalent net shift or response, ∆R, 

the magnitude of this response will always be some smaller fraction of the total receptor 

pool or weight of the system. Interestingly, this also demonstrates that a balance can 

show the curiosity, which is known as "spare receptors", when modeled with Langmuir 

binding. 

The peak response of these curves can be found by taking the first derivative of 

Equation (2) with respect to S and setting it equal to zero. The peak occurs at (K1K2/2)1/2 

which can be useful to know for modeling and experimental purposes. Note that 

inhibitors can also be introduced into Equation (2) by including the inhibition factor (1+ 

I/ Ki) for an antagonist (I with its dissociation constant, Ki) multiplied times each of the 

dissociation constants, K1 and K2. This reproduces the effects of inhibitors in 

pharmacological systems and leads to the discovery of many useful effects [14].  

 

Since the manner by which a biological receptor functions can be modeled by this 

approach [13-15], pharmacologists and physiologists may find Figure 3 interesting for its 

similarity to the electrophysiological measurements of excitable cells [2,4,10,11,12]. The 

family of curves displayed in Figure 3 demonstrate the effect of decreasing the available 

receptor pool (R1 and R2) by 20 to 80%. The similarity between the responses observed 

in complex pharmacological systems and the balance model strongly suggests that 

cellular receptors mimic miniature chemical balances in a coupled, two-state equilibrium 

that can be shifted by perturbations from unequal molecular binding, or possibly other 

forces. It also suggests that many of the complex behaviors observed in these biological 

responses and similar systems are a direct result of the physicochemical responses to the 

perturbations affecting the underlying equilibrium of these systems. Although not 

explored here, this may also suggest potential applications in the areas of rapid chemical 

kinetics and theory of enzyme reactions. 

In conclusion, treating a simple balance with the restriction of Langmuir binding 

creates systems that behave surprisingly similar to many receptor systems that desensitize 

and suggests that a simple physical model displays those characteristics previously 

thought peculiar to many complex biological processes [1-15]. Desensitization is found in 

many unusual and amazing places - our senses, drug receptors, the neurochemical 

synapses within our brains, and a simple balance. This may be the first time that the 

behavior of a balance was described as a desensitizing system and experimentally tested. 

A balance that shows responses that desensitize similar to biological receptors offers a 

physical link between GPCR activation and desensitization, and may have implications 

for other areas of physics as well.

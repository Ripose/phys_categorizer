     Introduction: Dusty plasma systems play an
important  role  both  in  astrophysical  environments
(proto-stellar clouds and ring systems) and laboratory
situations  (plasma  processing).  In  general,  there  is
still  little  or  no  evidence  of  strongly  coupled  dusty
plasmas anywhere in nature.  However, over the past
two  decades  it  has  been  shown  that  dust  particles
immersed  in  plasmas  and  radiation  collect  charges
with their subsequent dynamics becoming influenced
-  or  in  some  cases  dominated  -  by  the  local  electric
and magnetic fields[1], [2].  (This is in addition to the
usual  gravitational,  radiation  pressure  and  drag
effects  on  the  particles.)    There  are  a  number  of
unusual observations - like the spokes at Saturn or the
dust  streams  escaping  Jupiter  -  that  can  only  be
understood through recognizing dusty plasma effects.
the  formation  and  stability
     In  addition, 
mechanisms for ordered colloidal (Coulomb) crystals
within  a  tenuous  dusty  plasma  is  of  great  interest  in
protoplanetary, protostellar, accretion disk formation,
spiral  galaxies  and  dark  matter  research.  Ever  since
crystal  formation  within  a  dusty  plasma  was
discovered experimentally at the Max Plank Institute
by  Morfill,  et  al.  [3],  interest  in  plasma  crystals  has
increased dramatically.
     Recent research has focussed on defining (both
theoretically  and  experimentally)  the  different  types
of  wave  mode  propagation  possible  within  plasma
crystals.  This  is  an  important  topic  since  several  of
the  fundamental  quantities  for  characterizing  such
crystals can be obtained from an analysis of the wave
propagation/dispersion.  There  are  two  primary  wave
modes  seen  experimentally  in  dust  crystals,  the  dust
acoustic  wave  (DAW)  and  the  dust  lattice  wave
(DLW).  The  dust  acoustic  wave  mode  is  created  by
pressure  gradients  from  the  ambient  plasma.  It  was
first  predicted  by  Rao,  Shukla  and  Yu theoretically
[4] and later observed in the laboratory [5]. The dust
lattice wave is similar to lattice waves observed in a
normal  solid  lattice  and  is  caused  by  the  shielded
coulomb interaction between dust grains in a plasma
crystal.  Experimentally,  Pieper  and  Goree[6]  found
dust acoustic waves in horizontally extended crystals
produced  in  RF  discharges  by  applying  a  modulated
voltage to a wire positioned close to the dust grains.
Dust  lattice  waves  have  been  observed  by  A.
Homann  et  al  [7],  [8]  in  both  one  and  two-
dimensional  RF  discharge  plasma  crystals.  In  their
situation, the waves were created using a laser as the
perturbation mechanism. Although some theoretical

work  has  also  been  conducted  in  these  areas,
additional numerical simulations of both DLW's and
DAW's in plasma crystals are needed.
     Computer  model:  In  this  research,  both  modes
are  studied  using  a  Box_Tree  code.  The  Box_Tree
code is a Barnes-Hut tree code first written by Derek
Richardson[9]  for  planetary  ring  and  disk  studies.  It
was later modified by Lorin Matthews[10] to include
electrostatic  interactions  and  then  used  by  John
Vasut[11]  to  simulate  the  formation  of  plasma
crystals.  It  is  proving  to  be  an  effective  tool  for
modeling  systems  composed  of  large  numbers  of
particles. The Box_Tree code models a dusty plasma
system  by  first  dividing  it  into  self-similar  patches,
where  the  box  size  is  much  greater  than  the  radial
mean  excursions  of  the  constituent  dust  grains.
Boundary  conditions  are  met  using  twenty-six  ghost
boxes. A tree code is incorporated into the Box_Tree
routine to allow it to deal with both gravitational and
electrostatic interactions between the particles.  Since
most interactions can be calculated by examining the
multipole  interactions  of  collections  of  particles,  the
code scales as N•logN instead of N2.
     R e s u l t s :     Using  Box_Tree,  a  crystal  lattice
composed  of  dust  grains  was  established  from  a
random  distribution.  By  perturbing  one  line  of  the
lattice,  a  dust  lattice  wave  was  excited  and  then
analyzed 
lattice
parameters.  Several  sets  of  results  will  be  presented
and probable applications within planetary rings will
be discussed.

Abstract 

The impact of field shape optimization is studied for prostate type geometry. For this 

study, 76 and 81 Gy plans were generated. Dose distributions for wedged plans and 

Intensity Modulated (IM) plans for three and seven fields were compared for a quadratic 

cost function. For wedged plans, a Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) was used to 

optimize gantry angles, wedge angles, beam weights and field shapes. Two kinds of 

wedged plans were generated: 1) field sizes were determined by the requirement of full 
 

target coverage in the beam's-eye-view (fixed fields) and 2) the field shape, in particular 

at the critical organ target overlap region was also among the variables optimized. For IM 
 

plans the SAA was used to optimize gantry angles and a conjugate gradient algorithm 
 

was used to optimize the IM beam fluences. Both the field shape optimized wedged plans 

and IM plans had significantly superior dose area histograms of the target, rectum and the 
 

bladder and cost function values compared to the fixed field optimized wedged plans.

Introduction 

The primary task in radiation therapy treatment planning and delivery of radiation dose is 
 
to deliver maximum dose to the tumor while minimizing dose to the critical normal tissue 
 
surrounding it. Quantitative dose volume constraints on both tumor and the normal 
 
tissue(s) are normally part of a physician's prescription. 

This task in reality depends on a number of variables that all affect the resulting radiation 
 
dose distributions in various ways. The following is a list of such variables: 

1) number of radiation beams 
 
2) orientation of the radiation beams 
 
3) beam modifiers that are called "wedges" with which the beam intensity gradient in 
 

one of the dimensions of the beam cross section can be changed 

 
4) the modality/energy of the radiation used (electron beam or photon beam and the 
 

energy of such beams) 

 
5) beam weights 
 
6) the shape of the cross sectional area of the beam 
 
7) the beam fluence variation within the cross section of the beam, also called Intensity 
 

Modulation (IM) 

 
 

 

 

 

In most of the institutions adjusting the variables listed from 1-6 is carried out by trial and 
 
error manually until dose distributions close to matching the prescription are found. This 

M S Muthuswamy et al

limits the ability to generate the best dose distribution and also necessarily makes the 
 
prescription requirements less complex. 

 

This task of generating best dose distributions can also be viewed as an optimization 
 
problem. The prescription dose requirements on the tumor and normal tissue can be 
 
expressed in terms of cost functions (Webb 1997). The goal here is to optimize the cost 
 
function that depends upon a number of variables (above list 1-7). The optimization of 
 
variables 1-5 in the list may be called conventional optimization. Optimization of 
 
variables 1-6 may be called Field Shape Conventional Optimization (FSCO), the new 
 
technique proposed here. Optimization of variables 1-7, excluding #3, #5 and #6 in 
 
literature is known as Intensity Modulated (IM) Optimization. Optimization of wedge 
 
angles and beam weights has been studied before and authors point out the usefulness this 
 
optimization procedure (Oldham et al 1995). However, the fundamental problem in 
 
conventional optimization is its inability achieve desirable dose distributions in situations 
 
of significant tumor-dose limiting critical organ overlap (Webb 97). In this paper, such 
 
overlap situations either correspond to a critical organ lying inside the concave outline of 
 
the tumor or the tumor lying inside the concave outline of a critical organ. The problem 
 
of delivering dose with conventional approach in such situations is the following. While 
 
trying to ensure minimum prescription dose requirements on tumor at the same time leads 
 
to large dose being delivered to the part of the critical organ located in the overlap region. 
 
Some such situations occur in prostate tumor-rectum overlap, prostate tumor-bladder 
 
regions, tumors near spinal cord such as thyroid cancers, laryngeal tumors with subglottic 
 
extension, and hypopharyngeal cancers with postcricoid extension, and optic nerve sheath 
 
meningioma's.

Intensity Modulation Optimization 
 
Intensity Modulation optimization promises to provide more improved dose distributions 
 
even in situations of significant tumor-dose limiting critical organ overlap (Webb 1997). 
 
To quote Webb (p 135, 1997), "... .prostate wraps around the rectum and is in turn itself 
 
wrapped around by part of the bladder, creating a requirement for IMB (Intensity 
 
Modulated Beam) therapy". Numerical back projection methods and simulated annealing 
 
based methods and others have been used for both dose and biology based cost functions 
 
in intensity modulation optimization (Brahme et al 1982, Brahme 1988, Webb 1989, 
 
Holmes et al 1991, Webb 1992, Kallman et al 1992, Wang et al I996). 

In general, the number of degrees of freedom associated with this entire list 1-7, 
 
(excluding 3, 5 & 6) is large and even optimizing a limited number of the variables while 
 
including scatter dose can be complex and time consuming (Stein et al 1997). For 
 
instance, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer the optimization problem is performed 
 
(Ling et al 1996) by fixing the number of beams and their orientations while allowing for 
 
beam fluence optimization within the cross section of the beam (IM, #7 on the above 
 
list). Even this is a multivariable complex optimization problem. This can be seen from 
 
the fact that if the cross section of the beam is divided into smaller grid sizes, in the 2-D 
 
space, the number of such grids is proportional to the square of the grid width. It is clear 
 
therefore that IM dose distributions couldn't be achieved manually by trial and error.

Simulated Annealing Algorithm is particularly suited to application in optimization 
 
problems that have cost functions with multiple minimums (Webb 1989, Mageras and 
 
Mohan 1992, Rosen 1994). In case of a cost function expressed in terms of Normal 
 
Tissue Complication Probabilities (NTCP) and Tumor Control Probabilities (TCP) 
 
multiple minimums are possible (Mageras and Mohan 1992). A cost function expressed 
 
as a function of squares of quadratic dose differences has only one minimum for fixed 
 
beam orientations. However when beam orientations are also optimized it may have 
 
multiple minimums (Bortfeld et al I993). In the recent years some groups have increased 
 
the complexity of the IM optimization problem by also optimizing beam orientations 
 
(Stein et al 1997) in simulations. Due to its complexity clinical applications of IM dose 
 
delivery involving beam orientation optimization is not popular. It has been observed that 
 
the beam orientations are important when the number of beams are small (Stein et al 
 
1997). 

 

Once the simulations are completed the IM optimized beam dose fluences at appropriate 
 
beam orientations need to be delivered to the prescribed site of a patient. There are 
 
several ways of delivering the IM optimized beam. They are: 1) NOMOS PEACOCK 
 
(Carol et al 1995) and Tomotherapy (Mackie et al 1993) systems based on the concept of 
 
binary temporal modulation; 2) overlapping fields with static delivery (Galvin et al 1992 
 
Bortfeld et al 1994, Boyer 1994, Gustafsson et al 1995) 3) sweeping variable gap with 
 
dynamic delivery (Kallman et al 1988, Convery et al 1992, Bortfeld et al 1994, Mohan 
 
1996); 4) arc therapy with dynamic delivery (Yu 1995) and 5) construction of 2-D 
 
compensators (Djordjevich et al I990).

In general, these approaches of delivering dose to patients that use cutting edge 
 
technology are complex, expensive and time consuming in general compared to the 
 
conventional techniques (Ling et al 1996, Webb 1997). In many cases it requires buying 
 
expensive specialized technology such NOMOS PEACOCK (Carol et al 1995) and 
 
Tomotherapy (Mackie et al 1993) systems. Due to the complicated dose delivery scheme 
 
of IM there is also a problem of verification of its accuracy (Webb 1997). Ling et al 
 
(1996) have put forward an extensive QA system for dynamic leaf therapy. The 
 
verification and the QA issues related to the IM are considerably more complex than 
 
conventional therapy (that may include static MLC). 

The proposed technique of Field Shape Conventional 0lJtimization (FSCO) plans: 
 
Normally in the conventional optimization procedure of the cost function, the field 
 
shapes are chosen so that in the beam's-eye-view (i.e. from the direction of the beam) the 
 
field shape covers the entire planning target volume (target = tumor + margins 
 
representing clinical and setup uncertainties). We are proposing an approach of 
 
optimizing this field shape. This means in certain situations in the beam's-eye-view the 
 
target may not be covered. The Field Shape Conventional Optimized plans (FSCO) we 
 
propose are those in which the variables listed 1-6 in the previous page are optimized 
 
numerically. Since the last step listed before (#7) is not included, the IM is not performed 
 
in this optimization. Optimization of field shapes was investigated by Gustafsson et al 
 
(1995). However, their investigation does not simultaneously optimize wedge angles and 

M S Muthuswamy et al 

 

  8

 
gantry angles in addition to field edges. Only by optimizing the variables 1-6 on the list 
 
in previous page the potential of FSCO as an alternative to IM can be addressed. 

 

 

 

Specifically, in this work we are optimizing the location of the field edge passing through 
 
the target-critical organ overlap region. As this problem is addressed in 2-D, field edge is 
 
optimized. In 3-D it would be optimizing field shapes. Field edge optimization is a subset 
 
of the more general field shape optimization. Field shape optimization of the regions of 
 
target not adjacent to the dose limiting normal tissues can also be done to provide 
 
adequate dose coverage to the target. Such an investigation was not carried out here. 

Based upon the preliminary results (shown in the next section), we hypothesize that the 
 
FSCO plans are better than optimized conventional plans not involving field shape 
 
optimization (excluding #6 and 7 item on the list in the previous page). Based upon the 
 
preliminary results, the FSCO are also comparable to the generalized IM optimized plans 
 
(involving variables listed 1,2,4 and 7 in the previous page). These findings were 
 
observed for situations of tumor-dose limiting critical organ overlap. Since conventional 
 
optimization is a subset of FSCO optimization (this and the previous paragraphs) and 
 
based upon our preliminary findings, the FSCO optimization should very likely lead to 
 
better dose distributions than conventional optimization. 

In this work conventionally optimized plans are compared with FSCO plans. This is done 
 
to study the impact of field shape optimization. These two are also compared with IM 
 
plans, as IM optimization remains the benchmark with which newer techniques can be 

M S Muthuswamy et al 

 

  9

 
compared. These comparisons were performed for three and seven field configurations 
 
for a prostate like geometry. A quadratic cost function used by Stein et al (1997) was 
 
optimized in this work. 

 

Method 

 

In this study we seek to address the feasibility and impact of the FSCO technique. This 
 
can be realized in two dimensions. It is worth pointing out that the feasibility and the 
 
implications of intensity modulation were first shown in 2-D that used simple exponential 
 
dose decay type models (without scatter) by researchers before its extensive application 
 
in 3-D geometry (Webb 1992 and references therein). Extensive studies of FSCO plan's 
 
impact in three dimensions including scatter will be the subject of a future work. The 
 
comparison of these three approaches was performed for a 2-D phantom geometry of a 
 
half-ellipse of major and minor axes of 25.0 and 17.5 cm. The target (prostate + margins), 
 
rectum and the bladder were described by overlapping circles of radii 2, 2 and 2 cm for 
 
geometry I (figure la) and 2.6, 1.4 and 2 cm for geometry II (figure lb). The centers of 
 
the target and the rectum were separated by 3.5 cm and the centers of the target and the 
 
bladder were also separated by 3.5 cm. Two different relative sizes of the target and 
 
rectum were chosen to study dependence of the results on the degree of target-rectum 
 
overlap. Dose grid size of 2 mm was used. Tissue to Phantom Ratio (TPR) of a 15 MV 
 
beam was used to describe the attenuation of the beam. Inverse square law dose 
 
dependence was incorporated but not the beam divergence or the scatter. The dose 
 
distributions of individual beams used in this work have step function like fall of beyond 

M S Muthuswamy et al

the edge of field. This is due to not including scatter. In the case of FSCO plans only the 
 
field edge in the target-rectum overlap region were optimized. For instance, if the beam 
 
orientation corresponds to a gantry angle of 180 degrees (figure 1), then the field edges, 
 
as they do not lie in the target-rectum overlap region were not optimized. For a beam 
 
orientation corresponding to 90 degree gantry angle only the field edge lying in the 
 
target-rectum overlap region was optimized and not the field edge lying in the target 
 
bladder overlap region. As according to this cost function, bladder is not the primary 
 
dose-limiting organ due to the high threshold value for penalty for bladder dose (85 Gy) 
 
relative to tumor dose (81 Gy). So it was decided not to optimize to field-edge in the 
 
target-bladder overlap area. For the 76 Gy plan, bladder is not even a dose-limiting organ 
 
(Table 1). The need to spare sections of a dose-limiting organ from high dose becomes 
 
greater with a high target prescription dose. Hence we decided to make comparisons for 
 
two sets of dose plans (76 Gy and 81 Gy). 

 

In the case of the conventional plan, gantry angles, wedge angles and beam weights were 
 
optimized using a Fast Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) (Mageras and Mohan 
 
1992). In the case of Field Shape Conventional Optimization (FSCO) plan, in addition to 
 
the gantry angles, wedge angles and beam weights, the location of the field edge at the 
 
rectum-target overlap region was also optimized using the SAA. Beam weight of a beam 
 
was taken to represent the dose from that beam at the isocenter. Wedge angles up to ±80 
 
degrees were considered. Negative wedge angle here represents wedge oriented in the 
 
opposite direction. In the case of Intensity Modulated (IM) optimized plans, the gantry 
 
angles were chosen by the SAA while the IM beam dose fluence were optimized by a 

M S Muthuswamy et al 

 

 11

 
conjugate gradient algorithm (Press et al 1986). These are summarized in Table 1. For a 
 
given beam orientations (chosen by the simulated annealing algorithm) and for a 
 
quadratic cost function, IM fluence optimization has obviously one minimum. Hence to 
 
speed up the IM fluence optimization process the conjugate gradient algorithm was 
 
implemented. In general, more the number of beams is more conformal the dose 
 
distributions are. Since the cost function we employed does not penalize increasing 
 
number of beams, the number of beams was not optimized. We have generated dose 
 
distributions for 3 and 7 field plans. Data comparisons of two sets of field numbers 
 
should provide insights into the consistency of this optimization study. 

 

 

Generally, not all of the gantry angles are treatable (Muthuswamy and Lam 1999). For 
 
ranges of gantry angles on either side of the couch part of the beam will pass through 
 
steel bars supporting the couch top. Such gantry angles are to be avoided. In this work, 
 
for the steel bar configuration of a Varian Clinac 2100C (Varian Corp., Palo Alto, CA, 
 
USA) machine and for this phantom geometry, the gantry angle ranges of (222.5-248.5) 
 
and (111.5-137.5) degrees were avoided as they lead to beam-couch intersection. 

A quadratic cost function defined for a set of penalty factors (Stein et al 1997) was 
 

                                                                                                N 

                                                                                               i=1 

F = Σ pi(Di –Di

p)2 / N 

optimized. The cost function reflects certain prescription requirements on target and the 
 
normal tissues. This cost function has been found to be appropriate except for those 
 
treatment sites for which the tolerant dose of dose limiting normal tissues is low and the 

M S Muthuswamy et al 

 

 12

 
volume effect is large (Wang et al 1995). This cost function may be appropriate for this 
 
prostate dose study. 

 

 

Here, N is the number of voxels, Di and Di
 
prescription (for prostate) or tolerance (for normal structure) doses at ith voxel. Also, pi is 
 

P are the relative values of actual and 

the penalty factor for ith voxel. The penalty factor for prostate is 1. The normal tissue 
 
penalty factors used for this cost function are given (Stein et al 1997) in Table 2. These 
 
penalty factors are different from zero only if the dose at a normal tissue voxel exceeds 
 
the tolerance dose given in the table. The reader is referred to Stein et al (1997) for 
 
details. During the IM fluence optimization process, the conjugate gradient (Press et al 
 
1986) sometimes generated negative fluence entries. These were truncated to zero. This 
 
was similar to what was done by Stein et al (1997). Plans were normalized such that at 
 
about 95% of the target area receives the prescribed dose. 

A Fast SAA described by Mageras and Mohan (1992) was used in this work. Like Stein et 
 
al (1997), we too found similar results with finite and zero temperatures in the simulated 
 
annealing optimization process. Local minimum trapping were avoided due to the long tail 
 
of the Cauchy distribution in the SAA (Mageras and Mohan 1992). The width of the  
 
Cauchy distribution was also updated in the manner described in Stein et al (1997) as, 

 
W(t)  =  W0/(1+t/R)

M S Muthuswamy et al 

 

 13

 
W(t) is the width of a variable that is varied in the SAA optimization process in the tth 
 
iteration. These variables were gantry and wedge angles, beam weights and field edge 
 
location. W0 is the start width and R is a control parameter. A very large value of R 
 
decreases the step size. This however makes the convergence very slow. The value of the 
 
control parameter was adjusted through trail runs so that regardless of the value of the 
 
starting width W0, approximately same value of the optimized cost function was reached. 
 
The Cauchy generator used in this algorithm was taken from a book by Rubinstein (1981). 
 
According to this algorithm, if x(t-1) is a variable such as a gantry angle in the (t-l) iteration  
 
step, for the width W(t), x(t) = x(t-l) + W(t)*A/B, where A and B are random variables  
 
belonging to the interval (-0.5, 0.5) and subject to the condition that A2 + B2 ≤ 0.25. The  
 
VAX (Digital Corp., MA, USA) random generator function RAN was used as a random  
 
generator of variables A and B in the interval (0,1). Then a value of 0.5 was subtracted  
 
from A and B. The distribution of the x variable generator using this version of the Cauchy  
 
generator has the characteristic long tail indicative of a Cauchy distribution plotted in  
 
Mageras and Mohan (1992). Optimization was stopped when (E-Emin)/E < m and W(t) < 
 
Wstop, here E is the mean cost function for the last 5N (N = number of beams * number  
 
variables associated with each beam) and Emin the minimum value of the cost function. The  
 
number of variables associated with SAA optimization for each beam: 1) in conventionally 
 
optimized plans were gantry and wedge angles and beam weight for a total of 3, 2) in FSCO  
 
plans were gantry and wedge angles, beam weight and field edge location for a total of 4,

M S Muthuswamy et al 

 

 14

and 3) in IM plans only gantry angle was optimized through SAA for a total of 1. Typical 
 
values were m=0.01, Wstop(gantry angle)=1°, Wstop(wedge angle)=O.5°, Wstop(beam 
 
weight)=0.1 and Wstop(field edge location)=0.002 cm. With the grid size of 0.2 cm, Wstop 
 
(field edge location) should be 0.2 cm and not 0.002 cm. This oversight led to increased 
 
time for the optimization process to converge. But this should not affect the results. 

 

Results 

 

It must be kept in mind that what is considered, as a "better" plan is implicit in the way 
 
the cost function is defined here. The cost function (Stein et al 1997) used in this work is 
 
such that large area of rectum getting dose less than the tolerance dose was not penalized. 
 
But even a voxel of rectum area getting a dose above the tolerance (Table 2) has the cost 
 
function value increased by a penalty. 
 
There is a left-right symmetry in both of the geometry. Due to that for each solution there 
 
is also another solution with the gantry angles mirror image of the displayed solution and 
 
appropriately oriented wedges. The optimized cost function values are displayed in the 
 
Table 3 for 3 and 7 field plans. In the SAA minimization process there is an uncertainty 
 
of about 10% in the converged value of the cost function from the global minimum value 
 
due to the finite number of iterations being performed. In this paper in addition to the 
 
comparisons between conventional optimization and FSCO, IM results are also shown with 
 
the possibility of establishing FSCO as an alternative to IM in some situations.

When field edge at the target-rectum overlap region was optimized, it was observed 

(Table 4) that the optimized half field edge width (denoted by ohwid) for some of the 

fields was smaller than the half field edge needed for full target coverage (denoted by 

fhwid). The values are displayed up to two decimal places in order to identify the voxel 

number they fall into. With a grid size of 2 mm, for geometry I, 81 Gy plan, field edge 

location of 1.80 cm is covered by 9 bins from the center and 1.85 cm is covered by 10 

bins from the center. So even with a difference of only .05 cm, these two edge locations 

signify a difference. In the case of 76 Gy plan for geometry Ionly one gantry angle had a 

field edge located in the target-rectum overlap region and hence was optimized. The field 

edge at the target-bladder overlap region was not optimized. 

Dose Area Histograms (DAH) of prostate target, rectum and the bladder are also shown 

in figures 2-7. The rectum DAHs are plotted in a log scale so that the high dose area are 

clearly distinguished for clarity. In figure 8 the beam fluence distribution of the IM beam 

profiles are shown for a 81 Gy plan. The dose fluence for all of bins displayed are defined 

as the dose deposited at the isocenter at a depth equaling the distance from the phantom 

surface to the isocenter for the central axis ray. The vertical dose profile distributions 

shown in figures 9 and 10 are useful in understanding advantages and limitations of various 

techniques compared here. The dose outside the target region in figures 9 and 10 arise from 

the intersection of beams (scatter is not included in this dose model). 

In figures 11 and 12 gantry angle orientations of the three field arrangements are shown. In 

the case of conventional and FSCO plans the beam weights and wedge angles are also 

shown. The location of the field edges can be noted from Table 4. Due to so many beams 

M S Muthuswamy et al

involved the seven field configurations are not plotted. Relevant data are shown in Tables 5 
 
and 6. 

 

 

Discussion 

 

It is seen in Table 3 that the cost function values of FSCO plans are systematically smaller 
 
than conventionally optimized plans. The reason for the lower minimized value of the cost 
 
function is due to the optimization of the location of the field edge in the case of FSCO. 
 
From Table 4, it can be noted that in the case of FSCO, the field edge lies inside of the 
 
location one would expect based upon full target coverage in the beam's-eye-view. This 
 
analysis becomes clearer when dose profiles in figures 9 and 10 are studied. Clearly, the 
 
field edge has shifted in the case of FSCO compared to conventionally optimized plan. In 
 
addition in the case of FSCO the target dose is much. more uniform. In the IM fluence 
 
distributions shown in figure 8 the voxel located at the edge of the field (26) has lower 
 
value of intensity compared to voxels near the middle of the field. This voxel is at the 
 
target-rectum overlap region. This is a way in which high dose to the rectum in the IM 
 
  approach is reduced in the optimization process. 

The dose outside the target region for the seven fields plans in figures 9 and 10 arise from 
 
the overlap of exit or entrance part of the beams. For instance in figure 9a, the conventional 
 
plan has a larger bladder dose (in the region -3.6 to -2.6 cm) compared to the FSCO plan. 
 
From Tables 5 and Table 6, the gantry angles of the conventional plan with dominant beam 
 
weights are 140.6 and 205.7 degrees. These are orientations of gantry angles originating 

 

M S Muthuswamy et al 
 
 
from the direction of the bladder (figure 1). Where as in the case of FSCO the gantry angles 
 
with dominant beam weights were 84.8 and 274.8 degrees. These are nearly lateral 
 
orientations, avoiding considerable portions of rectum and bladder. 

 17

 

 

The optimized beam orientations (gantry angles) are different between conventional FSCO 
 
plans (figures 11 and 12 and Table 5). At least in the case of three fields FSCO plans, there 
 
appear to be more inclination for the beams to come from the direction of the dominant 
 
dose limiting critical organ, rectum compared to FSCO. This is even more so with IM 
 
plans. This is consistent with the observations in the previous work of Stein et al (1997). 

From the DAHs in figures 2-5 it can be seen that in general, compared to conventionally 
 
optimized plans, both FSCO and IM optimized plans have more uniform target coverage 
 
and the maximum rectum dose is also reduced in these plans. While the cost function 
 
values for the 3 field FSCO and IM plans are not significantly different, for the 7 field 
 
plans they are different. But this is not reflected in the DAHs (figures 3a and 3b) 
 
significantly. So it appears that from the point of view of DAHs the FSCO appears to 
 
have done as well as the IM plans. Bladder DAHs for the FSCO and the IM 76 Gy plans 
 
are better than the conventionally optimized plans even though the bladder tolerant doses 
 
and penalty factors are not used for the 76 Gy plan. For the 81 Gy plan where these 
 
considerations are taken into account, the FSCO and IM plans still come out ahead 
 
compared to conventional plans. 

M S Muthuswamy et al 

 

 18

 
The maximum target dose in figure 3b for the conventional plan is around 113 Gy, a 
 
rather high target dose. In this 81 Gy plan, there is a heavy penalty for getting rectum 
 
overdosed compared to target (Table 2). Therefore, a way to keep the cost low is through 
 
a higher target dose inhomogeneity. Another reason for the large dose uniformity is the 
 
requirement that about 95% of the target area gets the prescription dose. We believe this 
 
is what the optimization algorithm has done considering the consistency of both (high) 3 
 
field and 7 field conventional cost function values (Table 3) compared to FSCO and IM 
 
plans. From the point of view of conventional planning this target non-uniformity 
 
associated with all of these plans may be regarded as a disadvantage with this type of cost 
 
function. However, the FSCO and IM plans have much better target uniformity with the 
 
same cost function. 

 

 

In this work scatter and divergence were not taken into account, as was 3-D geometry. 
 
Since one is comparing different technique rather than absolute dose evaluations, the 
 
relative impact of including beam divergence is likely to be comparable. Hence the relative 
 
results between conventional optimization and FSCO shouldn't depend upon the 
 
divergence. 

Scatter was not implemented in the dose calculation algorithm. The impact of scatter is 
 
transfer of the dose around the field edge and its deposition outside of the field margins 
 
(Mohan et al 1996). From figures 9 and 10, it can be seen that the relative impact of 
 
including scatter should be comparable. This should be because we have seen that reduced 
 
cost function value in the case of FSCO has come about through the reduced field width in

the overlap region. Therefore, we conclude that the significant improvement we have seen 
 
with FSCO over conventionally optimized plan should remain when scatter is taken into 
 
account. 

However, the inclusion of scatter should make IM plans better compared to the FSCO 
 
plans due to the ability of IM plans to modulate intensity around the field edges (Mohan et 
 
a1 1996). In particular this aspect of IM should lead to more uniform dose coverage of the 
 
target (Mohan et al 1996). In order to provide adequate dose coverage to the target, in 3-D 
 
it is conceivable that more beams may be required in the case of FSCO plans compared to 
 
the IM plans. 

Arbitrary wedge angles are generated as part of this optimization process for non-IM 
 
plans. Arbitrary wedge angles could be achieved using a dynamic wedge. When 3-D 
 
application of this model are considered, constraints on more easily attainable wedge 
 
angles such as less than 60 degrees can be considered. The advantage of considering 
 
wedge angles less than a physically available wedge angle is that, any wedge angle less 
 
than a physical wedge angle could be achieved through a combination of that physical 
 
wedge and an open field. 

Application of FSCO technique to the 3-D geometry requires addressing several issues. 

Among them being able to deliver arbitrary wedge angle beams in two directions. This 
 
could be achieved by using dynamic wedging in two directions or through collimator 
 
rotations of physical wedges. Also, the impact of defining average "wedge angle" in 

M S Muthuswamy et al 

 

 20

 
going from 2-D to 3-D needs to be investigated. Even in 2-D, optimizing field shape in 
 
more than one location needs to be investigated. The method of optimization of field 
 
shapes could be extended to 3-D (Gustafsson et al 1995) geometry similarly. Field shape 
 
optimization in 3-D geometry should translate to optimizing 2-D field shapes. 

 

 

Since conventional optimization is a subset of FSCO, FSCO plans are always going to be 
 
better than conventionally optimized plans. The extent of improvement of FSCO over 
 
conventional plan needs to be investigated further for other types of geometry and cost 
 
functions. In the current algorithm variables are searched in a continuous space. We have 
 
seen that the impact of small changes in many of the parameterized variables on dose 
 
distributions is minimal, hence discrete sampling of variables can be employed. This should 
 
speed up the optimization process. 

Since one would like to compare the "best" conventional plan with the "best" FSCO plan, 
 
the added complexity of optimizing gantry angles was taken. One possible study is to 
 
compare for a given gantry, wedge angles, beam weights and for a set of beam 
 
orientations, the impact of field shape optimization only. This is an ongoing study and 
 
will be part of another paper. As we have seen the "best" conventional, FSCO and IM 
 
plans may have different gantry angle orientations (figues 11 and 12 and Table 5). This 
 
may also imply that optimizing beam orientation in conjunction with field shape works to 
 
make the plans better. This is the reason for also optimizing gantry angles in this work. It 
 
is conceivable that in future gantry angles may also be routine optimized (Stein et al 
 
1997). Another issue to address is whether simultaneous optimization of gantry angles 

M S Muthuswamy et al 

 

 21

 
and IM beam fluence can lead to different results. We believe that due to the quadratic 
 
form of the cost function used in this study, choosing the gantry angle first followed by 
 
IM optimization by the conjugate gradient algorithm leads to the global minimum. The 
 
consistency of the minimized cost function values of IM plans in Table 3 may tend to 
 
support this view. Also, without first defining the beam orientation by the selection of the 
 
gantry angle, solving IM fluence by conjugate gradient algorithm is not defined. 

In a previous study (Mohan et al 1996) in which after the IM plans were optimized, the 
 
margins were adjusted when scatter was taken into account to arrive at "better" dose 
 
distributions. However, these authors do not seek to optimize the location of the margins 
 
(or equivalently the field shapes as they are called in this paper) with respect to the same 
 
cost function. 

 

 

This study shows that it possible to improve conventionally optimized plans significantly by 
 
including field shape optimization. As we have seen, clearly, the feasibility and the impact 
 
of field shape optimization can be realized in 2-D. In FSCO plans, the field shape is the 
 
result of the optimization algorithm as opposed to full target coverage in the beam's-eye 
 
view of the conventional approach. So the delivery of field shape optimized plans should not 
 
be significantly different from conventional plan delivery. Even a mutileaf collimator may 
 
not be needed for the delivery of FSCO plans, as the fields may be shaped using cerrobend 
 
blocks. It probably should not take any more time to deliver FSCO treatments as 
 
compared to conventional treatments. It is important to note that conventional hardware 

M S Muthuswamy et al 

 

 22

 
can be used for treatment delivery of the FSCO, which can be carried out in most 
 
community hospitals. 

 

The consistently close comparison between FSCO and IM techniques is worth noting. 
 
Importantly, this work also points to the potential of FSCO as an alternative to IM 
 
technique in some situations. Such situations are those of critical organ lying in the 
 
concave outlines of the tumor or vice versa (overlapping situations). In non-overlapping 
 
situations, Sherouse (1994) had pointed out that by optimizing the wedge angles one 
 
could achieve desired target dose distributions, especially for a small target. However, 
 
for a large target it may not be possible to achieve a desired dose distribution by adjusting 
 
beam weights, field shape, gantry and wedge angles globally (Webb 1997). In such 
 
situations IM may be a better options unless one opts for multi segmental treatment with 
 
FSCO. The FSCO technique needs to be further investigated with various shapes of 
 
critical organ-target overlap in 3-D with full-fledged dose models. These investigations 
 
need to be carried out with biologically based cost functions as well (Webb 1997).

A new particle identification device for Jlab 12 GeV program is proposed. It is based on 
the  measurement  of  time  information  obtained  by  means  of  a  new  photon  detector  and 
time  measuring  concept.  The  expected  time  measurement  precision  for  the  Cherenkov 
time-of-flight detector is about or less than 10 picosecond for Cherenkov radiators with 
lengths less than 50 cm.  

1.  Introduction 

 
 

Time  measurements  are  used  in  high  energy  particle  and  nuclear  physics 
experiments  to  identify  particle  types,  and  to  distinguish  background  from  real  events 
(see  e.g.  [1]).  In  some  cases  precise  time-of-flight  (TOF)  measurements  can  provide  a 
better  measurement  of  the  particle  energy  than  the  magnetic  spectrometers.  The  time 
precision limit for the current systems consisting of particle detectors based on vacuum 
photomultiplier tube -PMTs or hybrid photon detector -HPDs, timing discriminators and 
time to digital converters is about 100 ps (FWHM). 

However, it is well known that timing systems based on RF fields can provide ps 
precision.  Streak  cameras,  based  on  similar  principles,  are  used  routinely  to  obtain 
picosecond time resolution of the radiation from pulsed sources [2-4]. The best temporal 
resolution is achieved with a single shot mode. Using continuous circular image scanning 
with 10-10s period, a time resolution of 
s 
10
for pulses consisting of ~17 secondary electrons, induced by heavy ions, was achieved in 
early  seventies  [5].  With  a  streak  camera  operating  in  the  repetitive  mode  known  as 
“synchroscan”,  typically,  a  temporal  resolution  of  2  ps  (FWHM)  can  be  reached  for  a 
long  time  exposure  (more  than  one  hour)  by  means  of  proper  calibration  [6].  But,  the 
streak cameras are expensive, their operation is complicated and they did not find wide 
application in the past in the elementary particle and nuclear physics experiments.

The basic principle of a RF timing technique or a streak camera is the conversion 
of  the  information  in  the  time  domain  to  a  spatial  domain  by  means  of  ultra-high 
frequency RF deflector.  Recent R&D work (ISTC Project A-372, [7]) has resulted in an 
effective 500 MHz RF circular sweep deflector for keV energy electrons. The sensitivity 
of  this  new  compact  RF  deflector  is  about  V/mm  and  is  an  order  of  magnitude  higher 
than  the  sensitivity  of  the  RF  deflectors  used  previously.  An  essential  progress  in  this 
field can be reached by a combination of a new RF deflector created at YerPhI with new 
technologies  for  position sensors, e.g.  position sensitive electron  multipliers from Burle 
Industries  Inc.,  USA  [8]  and  of  a  new  concept  for  a  compact  and  easy-to-use  photon 
detector and timing concept with picosecond  resolution proposed recently in [9].

In  this  paper  we  consider  a  Cherenkov  time-of-flight  detector  based  on  the  new 

 
photon detector and the time measuring concept.  

 
 

2. Picosecond Photon Detector 
 

 The  principle  of  the  picosecond  photon  detector  is  to  couple  in  vacuum  the 
position  sensitive  technique  to  an  input  window  with  photocathode  evaporated  on  its 
inner  surface  (Fig.1).  The  light  photon  incident  on  the  photocathode  generates  a 
photoelectron,  which  are  subsequently  accelerated  up  to  several  keV,  focused,  and 
transported to the RF resonator deflector. Passing through the RF deflector, the electrons 
change  their  direction  as  a  function  of  the  relative  phase  of  electromagnetic  field 
oscillations in the RF cavity, thereby transforming time information into deflection angle. 
In  this  project,  we  propose  to  use  the  oscilloscopic  method  of  RF  timing,  which  will 
result  in  a  circular  pattern  on  the  detector  plane.  The  coordinates  of  the  secondary 
electrons  are  measured  with  the  help  of  a  position  sensitive  detector  located  at  some 
distance  behind  the  RF  deflecting  system.  The  architecture  of  the  technique  is  very 
similar  to  the  design  of  the  HPDs  [10-12].  In  contrast  to  ordinary  PMTs,  where  a 
photoelectron  initiates  a  multi-step  amplification  process  in  a  dynode  system,  in  the 
HPDs a photoelectron undergoes single-step acceleration from the photocathode towards 
the position sensitive detector where electron multiplication process happens in the solid 
state anode target material.

Recently at YerPhI, we have successfully employed a dedicated RF deflecting system 
at a frequency of about f = 500 MHz and obtained a circular scan of a 2.5 keV electron 
beam  on  the  phosphor  screen  (see  Fig.  2).  This  compact,  simple  and  effective  RF 
deflecting system is very suitable for high frequency RF analyzing of few-keV electrons.

The  time  resolution  of  the  system  presented  in  Fig.1  depends  on  several  factors 

 
 

[13, 14]: 
 

2.1 Physical Time Resolution of Photocathode 
 

General  quantum-mechanical  considerations  show  that  the  inherent  time  of  the 
photoelectron  emission  should  be  much  shorter  than  10-14s.  However,  a  delay  and  time 
spread  D
p,  of  the  electron  signal  can  be  caused  by  the  finite  thickness  of  the 
photocathode D
l = 10nm and 

l and the energy spread of the secondary electrons D

. For D

 = 1 eV we obtain D

 10-13s. 

 
2.2 Physical Time Resolution of Electron Tube 
 

The  minimal  physical  time  dispersion  of  the  electron  optics  is  determined  by 
chromatic  aberration  due  to  the  electron  initial  energy  spread  D
t, 
due to this effect in the case of a uniform accelerating electric field E in V/cm near the 
photocathode plane is D

2.3 Technical Time Resolution of Electron Tube 
 

Electron tube is a device with precise electron focusing with effective electron transit 
time  equalization.  The  time  precision  limit  for  the  whole  system  consisting  of  photo-
cathode, accelerating, focusing and transporting parts in the carefully designed system is 
estimated to be on the order of 0.1 ps (FWHM) for point like photocathode [15] and 10 ps 
(FWHM) for active photocathode diameter of 4 cm [16] or even larger [17].  
 
2.4 Technical Time Resolution of RF Deflector 
 

D t

=

/ vd
,

By definition, the technical time resolution is:

 where  d  is the size of the 
electron beam spot or of the position resolution of the secondary electron detector if the 
electron  beam  spot  is  smaller,  while  v   is  the  scanning  speed:
.  Here  T  is  the 
period  of  rotation  of  the  field,  R  is  the  radius  of  the  circular  sweep  on  the  position

3. Position Sensitive Detector 
 
       The  position  sensitive  detectors  for  the  RF  timing  technique  should  have  the 
following properties: 

•   High detection efficiency for 2.5-10 keV single electrons; 
•   Position sensitivity, for example, 
•    High rate capability. 
These  three  requirements  are  to  a  different  degree  realized  by  several  types  of 
detectors.  They  include  vacuum-  based  devices  such  as  the  Multi-anode  PMT  [18,19], 
Micro  Channel  Plate  (MCP)  [20]  as  well  as  arrays  of  Si  PIN  [21]  and  Avalanche 
Photodiodes (APD) [22] or APD working in a Geiger mode (SiPM) [23].  

of 0.5 mm;

x

However, the best approach is the development of a dedicated multi-anode PMT with 

circular anode structure.  

Position determination can be performed in two basic architectures: 
1)  Direct readout: array of small pixels, with one readout channel per pixel, such as 
available with avalanche Si diodes. The position resolution in this case is about or 
better than the size of readout cell. 

2)   Interpolating  readout:  position  sensor  is  designed  in  such  a  way  that  the 
measurement  of  several  signals  (amplitudes  and/or  times)  on  neighboring 
electrodes  defines  event  position.  The  position  resolution  limit  for  both  cases  is 
D x/x~10-3 [24]. 

From  the  temporal  resolution  budget  discussed  above  one  can  conclude  that  the 

expected parameters of the technique are: 

a)  Internal time resolution for each photo-electron of about 2 ps; 
b)  Technical  time  resolution  in  the  range  of  (2-10)· 10-12s  for  f  =  500  MHz  RF 

deflector; 

c)  Absolute calibration of the system better than 10-12 s is possible, which is an order 

of magnitude better than can be provided by a regular timing technique.

After  the analysis  of the  available technical  solutions for electron multipliers in  our 
opinion  the  best  solution  is  the  development  of  a  dedicated  PMT  based  on  MCP  with 
circular  anode  structure  and  with  both  readout  architectures  for  position  determination 
with  relative  precision  close  to  10-3.  This  technique  also  provides  an  optical  waveform 
digitization  with  a  bandwidth  of  >10  GHz  and  can  be  used,  e.g.,  for  digitization  of 
Cherenkov radiation flash from elementary particles. 
 
4. Cherenkov TOF Detector Based on Picosecond Photon Technique 
 

The  time  resolution  of  the  TOF  counter  using  plastic  scintillators  is  inherently 

limited by the following effects besides the transit-time spread (TTS) of the phototube: 
i) 
ii) 

a finite decay time of photon emission; 
a different photon propagation-length or propagation-time in the scintillators to a 
phototube depending on the photon emission angle. 

Thus the conventional TOF counter measures the arrival time of the earliest photons out 
of many, whereby the remaining large amount of photons are not effectively used for the 
time measurement.  

By using Cherenkov radiation rather than the scintillation photons, two substantial 
and  undesirable  effects  can  be  eliminated.  While  a  decay  constant  of  fast  counting 
scintillator is typically ~2 ns, the flash duration of the Cherenkov radiation is ≤ 1ps [25]. 
While  the  propagation  paths  of  scintillation  photons  are  not  unique  due  to  uniform 
emission  over  4p
  solid  angle,  they  are  unique  for  the  Cherenkov  radiation.  The 
Cherenkov photon emission angle, q c, is uniquely determined by the particle velocity b
. 
Depending  on  the  particle,  its  momentum  range,  and  experimental  condition,  there  are 
various ways to do this using liquid, gas, or solid radiators with different type of photon 
detectors. 

We  will  consider  Cherenkov  TOF  detector  in  which  the  good  time  resolution  is  
crucial. Similar to the DIRC, Detection of Internally Reflected Cherenkov light [26], the 
Cherenkov  TOF  couples  DIRC  bar  with  a  picosecond  photon  detector  that  times  the 
photoelectrons seen at the end of the bar. In so doing, a DIRC utilizes the optical material 
of the radiator in two ways, simultaneously; first, as a Cherenkov radiator, and second, as 
a light pipe for the Cherenkov light trapped in the radiator by total internal reflection. The 
principal structure of the DIRC in the (x,y,z) coordinate system (bar frame) is illustrated 
in Fig.3.  

Each  radiator  is  a  long,  thin  bar  with  a  rectangular  cross  section  of  transverse 
dimensions  (tx,ty).  When  a  charged  particle  passes  through  the  radiator  bar,  Cherenkov 
q ,  where 
photons  are  emitted  in  a  conical  direction  defined  by  the  Cherenkov  angle 
cos
, n is the refractive index. The source length of the emitting region is the 
particle trajectory length in the radiation material. The angles, positions and momentum 
of the incident particle are provided by other detectors.

device.  The  particle  trajectory  is  shown  as  a  line  connected  by  dots;  representative 
trajectories of Cherenkov photons are shown by lines with arrows. 

qx = -qx'cosq pcosf p + qy'sinf p + qz'sinq pcosf p, 
qy = -qx'cosq pcosf p - qy'cosf p + qz'sinq psinf p, 
qz = qx'sinq p + qz'cosq p, 

 
 
 
In the three dimension DIRC concept, the high reflection coefficients inherent in 
the  total  internal  reflection  process,  and  the  fact  that  the  magnitudes  of  angles  are 
conserved during reflection from a flat surface allow the photons of the ring image to be 
transported  to  a  detector  outside  the  path  of  the  radiating  particle,  where  they  may  be 
imaged.  Denoting  the  polar  and  azimuthal  angles  of  an  incident  charged  particles  as  q p 
and f p, respectively, the directional cosines of the photon emission in the bar frame can 
be written as: 
 
 
 
 
 
where qi's(i = x',y',z') are the directional components of the photon emission in the frame 
where the particle moves along the z'-axis: 
 
 
 
 
 
The horizontal and vertical photon angles at the bar end are then given as  
 
 
 

qx' = sinq ccosf c, 
qy' = sinq csinf c, 
qz' = cosq c.

The azimuthal angle f c of Cherenkov photons is distributed uniformly over 2p

Therefore, a measurement of any two directional components or any two combinations of 
them  provides  information  about  q c.  In  a  DIRC  concept  the  two  parameters  (Q
)  and 
time measurement for extracting q c are used.

The DIRC prototypes have been constructed and tested over the past. The first large-
scale DIRC detector designed for physics is now running in the BABAR detector at PEP-
II [27].  

A number of DIRC devices have been proposed that use less than three dimensions. 
For example, a 1-D device called the Cherenkov Correlated Timing technique - CCT that 
couples  DIRC  bars  with  a  non-imaging  detection  system  that  times  the  first 
photoelectron(s) seen at the bar end was proposed [28]. A prototype has been constructed 
and tested by Kichimi et al.[29]. The technique uses the correlation between photon path-
length  and Cherenkov production angle  to infer this angle by measuring the time taken 
for the totally  reflected  Cherenkov photons to "bounce" to the end of the radiator. This 
simple principle can be illustrated by the 2-dimensional example shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 
also demonstrates the difference in flight path for light emitted by p
's (thick line) and K's 
(thin  line).  Due  to  this  difference  the  TOP  is  inversely  proportional  to  z  (quartz-axis 
direction)-component  of  the  light-velocity,  which  produces  TOP  differences  of,  for 
instance,  about  100  ps  or  more  for  normal  incident  4  GeV/c  p
  and  K  at  2  m  long 
propagation.

Akatsu  et  al.  have  proposed  and  tested  [30]  a  2-D  readout  DIRC  ,  one  timing 
, called them the Time Of Propagation -TOP 

 and one space dimension -F

The DIRC counters have confirmed that the Cherenkov radiation images are well 
transported  by  internal  total  reflection,  and  the  CCT  counter  exhibited  that  a  time 
measurement  of  such  photons  is  feasible,  while  the  TOP  detector  are  based  on  the 
concept of a 2-D readout DIRC, one timing dimension and one space.  

We  will  consider  TOF  technique  based  on  the  measurement  of  the  time  of 
propagation of Cherenkov photons, similar to the one dimension  DIRC-  CCT counters, 
but detection of Cherenkov photons will be carried out by means of picosecond photon 
detector.  
 
4.1 Simulation Study  
 

Based on the basic concepts considered in the preceding section, we have carried 
out  a  simulation  study  of  the  proposed  technique.  In  the  modeling  of  the  detector  the 
parameters  of  the  radiator  are  assumed  as  described  in  [28,  29].  There  are  several 
dominant contributions to the spread of the TOP of the Cherenkov photons in the radiator 
in addition to the time spread of photon detector:  
1)  The  time  spread  of  Cherenkov  radiation  along  the  particle  trajectory  over  the 
thickness  of  quarz  bar:  Cherenkov  photons  are  emitted  uniformly  along  the  path  of 
particle passage through the radiator.  

2)  The transit time spread of Cherenkov photons due to different trajectories: trajectories 
  of  individual 

q   and 

of  the  individual  photons  determined  according  to 
Cherenkov photons.

3)  The  chromatic  effect  of  Cherenkov  light:  for  the  numerical  calculations  we  take

4)  The  timing  accuracy  of  the  Photon  detector:  for  the  timing  accuracy  of  the  Photon

The  expected  total  number  of  photoelectrons-  Npe  detected  in  the  device  is:  Npe  = 
N0· ∆l· (D
c/360), where N0 = 155 pe/cm [29] is the Cherenkov quality factor, ∆l is the 
thickness of the radiator, D
c-is the azimuthal angular interval of the detected Cherenkov 
photons. The size of the radiator bar is 20 mm-thick (in y), 20 mm-wide (in x), and length 
is in the range 10-200 cm (in z). One end of the Cherenkov radiator is connected to the 
photon  detector  through  light  pipe,  the  special  design  of  which  allows  to  select  the 
azimuthal  angular  interval  -  D
c,  and  the  opposite  end  assumed  blackened  to  avoid 
reflection. So we are considering only forward - FW going photons. 

In  order  to  understand  the  TOP  behavior  and  to  evaluate  the  size  of  the  above 
effects to TOP and the PID power, a detail calculation has been performed. It has been 
demonstrated  that  the  results  of  previous  DIRC  simulations  [30]  as  well  as  of  the 
experimental  studies  [29]    are  reproduced  by  our  approach  with  precision  better  than 
20%. Some results are displayed in the Fig.5-Fig.7 and tabulated in Table 1.

These  simulations  have  demonstrated  that  such  a  simple  and  compact  TOP 
Cherenkov  counter  can  be  used  for  p
  and  K  separation  in  the  1-3  GeV/c  momentum 
range.  The differences of TOF between p
 and K are 231 and 37 ps at 10 m time-of-flight 
distance and for p = 4 and 10 GeV/c, respectively, and by using 40 cm length Cherenkov 
detector based on the picosecond photon detector, about 25s
 p /K separation can 
be reached for p = 4 and 10 GeV/c, respectively. 
 
5. Discussion and Summary 
 

 and 4s

Recent  R&D  work  has  resulted  in  a  simple  and  effective  RF  deflector,  and  to 
develop  and  construct  the  picosecond  photon  detector  the  problem  is  only  in  time  and 
money.  It is expected that the Cherenkov Correlated Timing counter or  Chernkov Time 
Of Propagation detector with picosecond photon detector, provide not only high particle 
identification  ability  comparable  with  the  ability  of  3D  DIRC,  but  also  they  are  more 
compact and flexible detectors.  

Such a counter with radiator L £

 50 cm is ideally suited as a TOF counter for PID 

up to a momentum of 10 GeV/c.  

Although  the  DIRC,  CCT  and  TOP  techniques  have  been  proposed  for  the  p /K 
identification  at  B-factories  they  also  can  find  application  at  fixed-target  experiments. 
Since the incoming particles in most cases of fixed-target experiments are incident nearly 
normal  to  the  detector,  a  maximal  separation  power  can  be  obtained.  CCT  and  TOP 
Cherenkov detectors can be used at CEBAF in all three Halls and in the future 12 GeV 
program  to  identify  particle  types.  The  operation  of  this  technique  with  CEBAF  CW 
photon-electron  beams  and  with  fine  bunch  microstructure  (~2ps  bunches  each  2  ns 
period),  is  similar  to  the  operation  of  the  RF  separator,  if  the  RF  deflector  is  operated 
with  the  same  frequency  as  the  master  oscillator  of  the  accelerator.  Secondary  photo-
electrons produced by electrons, pions, kaons, and protons with the same momentum and 
flight  path  and  from  the  same  place  of  the  radiator,  pass  the  RF  deflecting  system  are 
deflected by different angle and hit different places on the detector. Therefore, secondary 
electrons  from  different  kinds  of  particles  are  separated  in  space.  This  will  allow 
measurement  of  relative  velocities,  as  well  as  organization  of  dedicated  tagging.  For 
example, a carefully designed spectrometer and small size Cherenkov TOF detector will 
respond to only one kind of particle e.g. to kaons.

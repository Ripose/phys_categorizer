Abstract

In this paper we present studies of the I-V characteristics of CdZnTe detectors with Pt contacts fabricated from high-
resistivity single crystals grown by the high-pressure Brigman process. We have analyzed the experimental I-V curves using a
model  that  approximates  the  CZT  detector  as  a  system  consisting  of  a  reversed  Schottky  contact  in  series  with  the  bulk
resistance. Least square fits to the experimental data yield 0.78-0.79 eV for the Pt-CZT Schottky barrier height, and <20 V
for the voltage required to deplete a 2 mm thick CZT detector. We demonstrate that at high bias the thermionic current over
the Schottky barrier, the height of which is reduced due to an interfacial layer between the contact and CZT material, controls
the leakage current of the detectors. In many cases the dark current is not determined by the resistivity of the bulk material,
but rather the properties of the contacts; namely by the interfacial layer between the contact and CZT material.

1.  Introduction

The dark current is a critical parameter that for many configurations can be the primary factor limiting the energy
resolution of CdZnTe (CZT) detectors. In the course of developing a focal plane detector for the balloon-borne High-Energy
Focusing Telescope (HEFT) [1], we carried out routine measurements of the dark current characteristics for a large number
of CZT pixel detectors of a specific pixel contact design. Our detector anode pattern includes very thin strips (a grid) between
the pixel contacts, held at a small negative potential. The real purpose of this biased grid is to enhance the charge collection
near the surface between pixel contacts. However, for the dark current measurements we can ground the grid, so that it serves
as a guard ring to eliminate surface leakage currents, allowing accurate measurement of both surface and bulk leakage.

We tested a large number of CZT detectors, measuring the surface and bulk I-V curves over a wide voltage range.
We  found  large  variations  in  the  shapes  and  nominal  surface  dark  currents  for  different  detectors,  as  well  as  for  different
pixels  of  the  same  detector.  This  is  the  case  even  for  detectors  where  the  specific  bulk  resistivity,  as  defined  by
approximating I-V curves to Ohm’s law at very low bias, <0.5 V, varies only by 20-40%. In some detectors, the measured I-V
characteristics also resemble a simple Ohm’s law at higher bias. The specific resistivity, evaluated by fitting the data from a
high  voltage  region,  significantly  exceeds  the  upper  limit  established  for  the  CZT  material  used  in  these  measurements,
~5x1010 Ohm-cm at 26 C [2].

To  understand  these  experimental  leakage  current  measurements,  we  modeled  the  CZT  detector  as  a  metal-
semiconductor-metal  (MSM)  system  with  two  back-to-back  Schottky  barriers.  Two  simplified  treatments  have  been
previously  applied  to  such  a  system:  Sze  et  al.  [3]  used  the  thermionic-limited  approximation  of  the  Schottky  barrier,  and
Cisneros et al. [4] treated the barrier in the diffusion-limited approximation. Neither of these approaches could explain our
dark current measurements. In our previous work [5] we briefly pointed out that the experimentally measured currents were
considerably smaller than the saturation thermionic current expected for the Pt-CZT, and the measured I-V curves differed in
shape from the diffusion-limited current expected for two back-to-back Schottky barriers.

Although the models described above are over-simplified, we also cannot explain our I-V curve measurements over
the  full  voltage  range  even  with  a  more  general  treatment  of  an  MSM  system.  Crowell  and  Sze  [6]  demonstrated  that  the
thermionic- and diffusion-limited  models are not independent, but  are  in  fact  limiting  cases  of  a  more  general  thermionic-
diffusion theory. Using this theory we can reproduce the measured I-V curves at a low voltages (in some cases up to 100 V),
but  at  high  voltages  the  measured  current  increases  much  faster  than  predicted  by  the  theory.  One  might  expect  that  the
discrepancy  could  be  explained  by  tunneling  across  the  interface  (normally  the  dominant  current  in  highly  doped

semiconductors at low temperatures). For this to be the case, our measurements show that tunneling would have to start to
contribute at ~50 V (for a 2 mm thick detector). At this low voltage, the total current across the CZT is much less than the
expected  saturation  thermionic  current  (see  Eq.  (21)  and  discussion  below).  The  tunneling  component  should,  however,
become important at much higher biases, where the thermionic emission component is close to its saturation limit (~500 V).

We  find  that  to  explain  the  shape  of  our  I-V  curves,  we  must  assume  the  existence  of  a  very  thin  (10-100  nm)
insulating layer (residual oxide layer) between the contact and the semiconductor material, which could be formed before or
after metal contacts are deposited [7-12]. To include the effects of an interfacial layer in the Schottky barrier model, Wu [14]
developed a combined interfacial layer-thermionic-diffusion (ITD) model. We show that adopting this ITD model allows us
to  accurately  fit  the  experimental  data  without  considering  any  other  possible  current  components  (such  as  tunneling,  or
generation recombination currents). We demonstrate that by taking into account the interfacial layer we can explain the full
variety of  measured  I-V  curves,  and  by  fitting  the  data  we  can  obtain  for  each  detector  a  consistent  set  of  parameters  that
characterize the Schottky barrier and CZT material.

2.  Theoretical background and fitting algorithm

This section briefly describes the theoretical model of the Schottky barrier with a thin interfacial layer, as applied to
the  MSM  system,  which  we  employ  in  our  analysis.  For  details  we  refer  to  the  original  work  by  Sze  et  al.  [3],  Sze  [15],
Cisneros et al. [4], Wu [14], and Cohen et al. [16]. From the mathematical point of view a Pt-CZT-Pt MSM system is rather
complicated. Fortunately, because of the high bulk resistivity of  semi-insulating  material such as CZT,  we can  make some
simplifications. The series resistance of the undepleted bulk material is much higher than the resistance of the forward-biased
Schottky barrier at the anode, and the width of its depleted layer is much smaller than the total thickness of the CZT crystal.
We can therefore neglect the effect of the anode contact. This simplification allows  us to treat a CZT detector as a  metal-

semiconductor system consisting of a reversed-biased Schottky barrier at the cathode coupled to the series resistance of the
bulk. The band diagram of this system is shown in Fig. 1.

The detectors we have studied have rectangular pixel contacts surrounded by a grid on the anode side (see Fig. 2.)
and a monolithic contact on the cathode side. We treat this as a one-dimensional system, where the electric field is uniform in
both X and Y directions. In the Schottky-depleted-layer approximation, if a small negative voltage, -V (V>0) is applied to the
cathode, the electric field distribution, U(z), inside both the depleted and undepleted regions of the detector can be written as:

U(z)=(eND/2ε)(z-W)2-EA(z-W) +∆V, 

0<z<W 

and

U(z)=EA(W-z)+∆V, 

W<z<L. 

(1)

(2)

In the above equations,  W is the  width of  the  depleted  layer,  L  is  the  thickness  of  the  CZT  crystal,  EA  is  the  electric  field
strength inside the undepleted bulk (same as at the anode), ε is the permittivity of CZT, e is the electron charge,  ND is  the
concentration of the ionized donor centers, and –∆V (∆V>0) is the potential at the edge of the depleted layer (∆V=(L-W)EA).
Using the boundary condition at the cathode and at the edge of the depleted layer, one can find the width of the depleted layer
from:

where Vbi is the built-in voltage or diffusion potential at the cathode (see Fig. 1). From this equation, W can be calculated if
EA or ∆V is known. If W/L<<1 and {(eND/2ε)W2-Vbi}/V<<1 then EA≡∆V/(L-W)=V/L, and I~V, i.e. at small applied biases the
current follows Ohm’s law. The voltage VRT required to deplete the whole volume of the crystal, defined as the reach-through
voltage, is given by:

where E0 is the electric field strength at the anode  when the cathode is at VRT, i.e. E0=EA(VRT). Notice, that  when the bulk
resistance  is  neglected,  E0=0,  and  Eq.  (4)  becomes  the  standard  expression  for  the  flat-band  voltage–a  parameter  usually
defined to characterize the back-to-back barrier system [3,4]. For applied voltages higher than VRT:

Correspondingly, the electric-field strength at the cathode EC–the parameter  which  we  will need for further calculations–is
given by:

V+Vbi=(eND/2ε)W2+∆V, 

VRT=(eND/2ε)L2+E0L-Vbi 

U(x)=VRT(z-L)2/2L+(z-L)V/L. 

EC(V)=(eND/ε)W+EA, 

V<VRT, 

and

EC(V)=(VRT+V)/L-E0,

V>VRT 

In the combined ITD model, the reverse current, IR (A/cm2), over the barrier at the cathode is expressed as [13]:

IR={ϑnA*T2/(1+ϑnVR/VD)}exp(-ΦR/VTH)(1-exp{-(V-RSIR)/VTH}), 

where  A*  is  the  effective  Richardson  constant,  T  is  the  temperature,  VR  is  the  thermal  velocity,  ϑn  is  the  transmission
coefficient through the oxide layer, RS is the series resistance of the bulk, and VTH=kT/e. VD is an effective diffusion velocity
[11,14] that can be calculated analytically if Eq. (1) is used to approximate the field distribution in the depleted layer. In this
case, VD is simply the electron drift velocity at the cathode, namely:

where µ is the electron mobility (µ=1000 cm2/Vs). The effective Richardson constant is related to the thermal velocity VR by:

where NC is the effective density of the states in the conduction band given by:

The  Schottky  barrier  height,  ΦR,  is  a  function  of  the  applied  voltage  and  reflects  the  barrier  lowering  due  to  the
voltage drop across the oxide layer. Again, following Wu [14], we assume that ΦR depends linearly on the applied voltage
(the barrier lowering due to image-force is negligible in our case) given by:

VD=µEC, 

A*T2≡VRNC, 

NC=2(2πm0kT/h2)3/2 

ΦR=Φ0-(1-1/n0)V,

where Φ0 is the barrier height under thermal equilibrium conditions, with

Here εI and δ are the permitivity and thickness of the interfacial layer, and DS is the density of surface states per unit energy
and area.

The series resistance of the undepleted layer can be expressed as:

1/n0=εi/(εi+e2δDS). 

RS=(L-W)/eNµ, 

where  N  is  the  free  electron  concentration  (we  assume  that  CZT  is  an  n-type  semiconductor).  Substituting  Eq.  (14)  into
Eq. (8) and using Eq. (5) for W and Eqs. (6,7) for EC we can numerically calculate the I-V dependence for the current across
the whole system. The above equations contain too many free parameters, and the information contained in a single I-V curve
is obviously insufficient to obtain the parameters from a fitting procedure. Our primary goal, however, is not to evaluate all
these parameters explicitly, but  to  demonstrate  that  by  assuming  reasonable  values  for  these  parameters,  the  measured  I-V
curves can be explained with the ITD model.

The  effective  Richardson  constant  can  be  calculated  as  A*=120(m*/m0)  (in  A-cm-2K-2),  where  m*  and  m0  are  the
effective and free electron  masses. Since the ratio m*/m0 for ZnTe and CdTe are 0.11 [17] and  0.09  [10],  respectively,  we
assume for CZT a similar ratio of 0.1. Thus, A*=12 A-cm-2K-2. N can be evaluated from Eq. (14) after fitting the I-V curve at
low voltages where the dependence follows Ohm’s law (W<<L and ∆V=V). For the typical intrinsic bulk resistivity of 3x1010
Ohm_cm, N=2.5x105 cm-3. The limits for the potential barrier height Φ0 can be found from results obtained for Pt-CdTe and
Au-CdTe systems (see e.g. Refs. [10,18]) where 0.7<Φ0<0.9. As for VRT, ϑn and n0, these parameters depend on the contact
fabrication process, and have to be found by fitting the I-V curves.

In the high voltage region, where the crystal is fully depleted (RS=0) Eq. (8) can be simplified:

IR={C0/(1+C1/(VRT+V-E0L))}exp(C2V). 

Here

C0=ϑnA*T2exp(-Φ0/VTH), 

C1=ϑnLVR/µ, 

and

C2=1-1/n0. 

If the effect of interfacial layer is negligible, C2=0 and ϑn=1. From Eq. (10) one can find the following expression  for the
ratio C0/C1:

C0/C1=(NCµ/L)exp(-Φ0/VTH), 

which allows us to estimate the potential barrier Φ0.

To fit the experimental data, we first assume that the parameters VRT and C2 are known, and apply Eq. (15) to fit the
I-V curve for the voltages above VRT (high enough that  E0L/VRT<<1).  We  then  evaluate  the  parameters  C0  and  C1  and  use
these to calculate the potential barrier height, Φ0, from Eq. (19), and the ϑnVR product from Eq. (17). ϑn and VR cannot be
evaluated  separately,  however,  since  we  assumed  that  A*  is  known  and  equal  to  12  A-cm-2K-2,  then  from  Eq.  (10):
VR=8.5x106 cm/s. We then find E0 by solving Eqs. (7) and (8) with V=VRT, and RS=0. This allowed us to calculate ND from
Eq. (4). Finally, we minimized the χ2(VRT,C2) function, given by:

χ2(VRT,C2)=∑{(ICAL-IMEAS)/σ}2, 

to obtain estimates for VRT and C2. Note that for V<VRT, we solve Eq. (3) and Eq. (8) numerically to calculate W, I and EA for
each applied voltage V.

3.  Experimental setup

We measured I-V dependencies using a probe stage with a GPIB-controlled HP 3458A multimeter and a EDC 521
DC calibrator. All measurements were taken at a steady state current condition. Because of the large number of deep traps in
the  CZT  material,  it  can  take  several  minutes  or  even  hours  to  reach  equilibrium  between  free  and  trapped  charge.  These
measurements are therefore very time consuming, and we use a computer-controlled setup.

To reduce the  waiting time before equilibrium is reached,  we  varied the bias  on  the  cathode  in  small  steps.  After
each step, we paused for several minutes before taking 10-20 sequential measurements of the current, separated in time by 1-
min  intervals.  This  sequence  of  data  points  allows  us  to  verify  that  equilibrium  has  been  actually  achieved,  and  also  to
improve the accuracy of the measurements. We took the majority of measurements at room temperature, (26 +/-1 C). For one
detector,  we  varied  the  temperature  from  17  to  70  C.  We  place  the  detector  on  a  hot-plate,  covered  by  a  super-insulating
screen. During the measurement the temperature stability was +/-0.5 C, monitored with a thermocouple (accuracy +/-0.1 C)
attached to the hot-plate in close proximity to the detector.

We  used  four  groups  of  CZT  pixel  detectors,  fabricated  by  eV-Products  over  a  two-year  period.  The  first  two
groups, labeled D1 and D2, were fabricated (to the best of our knowledge) from different slices of the same ingot, and we
therefore expect them to have similar performance. Detectors from groups D1 and D4 are 12x12x2 mm CZT crystals, each
with a single 8x8 mm contact enclosed inside a guard ring on one side, and a monolithic contact on the opposite side. The
gap between the contact and the guard ring is 0.2 mm. The detectors from group D2 are 8x8x2 mm single crystals, with four
patterns of 8x8 pixel arrays (see Fig. 2). The physical size of a pixel is 650 by 680 µm. 50 µm wide orthogonal strips are
placed between the pixel contacts. Each pixel from a pattern has the same gap between the contact and the grid, which varied
between 100 and 250 µm from pattern to pattern. Finally, the detectors from the third group, D3, are 7.1x7.1x1.7 mm CZT
crystals fabricated from a different ingot. The D3 detectors have pixel patterns similar to D2, except the pixel size is 400 by
400 µm, and the gaps between contacts and grid are 50 and 75 µm, with a 25 µm grid width.

We typically took the measurements from -100 V to +100 V between contacts and cathode, but for some detectors
we increased the maximum applied voltage up to 1 kV. We eliminated the leakage current flowing over the side surfaces of
the detector by using a guard ring.

4.  Results and discussion

Figs. 3-5 show the I-V characteristics for the three groups of detectors, measured for bias voltage of -100 to +100 V.
In these plots the currents are normalized to the effective area of the pixel contact (i.e. to the geometrical area with boundaries

in the middle of the gap between contact and grid). This approximation works only for small gaps. Fig. 3 shows the curves
measured for the two pixels of one of the D1 (large contact) detectors. The shape of the curves clearly indicates the existence
of  Schottky  barriers  on  the  anode  and  cathode  sides  of  the  detectors.  At  low  applied  biases  (<1  V)  the  I-V  curves  follow
Ohm’s law, with the slopes corresponding to a specific resistivity of 2.9x1010 and 2.2x1010 Ohm-cm for detectors D1 and D2
respectively. These are typical values for high-resistivity CZT material grown by eV-Products. As the voltage increases, the
linear slope starts to change. When the absolute voltage is between 1 and 50 V, the I-V relations again becomes close to a
linear law, but with a slope several times smaller.

We observed similar behavior for the D2 detectors (small pixel contacts). Fig. 4 shows a set of curves measured for
several different size pixels. Only the positive branches of the I-V curves (cathode is positive biased) exhibit the described
behavior. The negative branches seem to be affected by the surface conductance in the gap between the guard ring and the
contact, and show a slightly different behavior. Here the current reaches a local maximum at around -25 V and then decreases
and starts rising again (negative dynamic resistance). This asymmetry of the positive and negative branches indicates that the
CZT crystal is a n-type. Indeed, when a positive bias is applied to the cathode, a depleted layer starts to expand from a pixel
contact (for an n-type CZT) toward the cathode and along the surface into the gap between the contact and the guard ring (a
fringe effect). Effectively, this increases the area of the contact until the whole area along the surface becomes depleted. This
happens  at  relatively  low  biases,  for  which  the  measured  current  is  still  bulk  resistance  limited.  At  positive  biases  on  the
cathode, the fringe effect does not show up in the I-V curves. However, when a negative bias is applied to the cathode, the
depleted  layer  starts  to  grow  from  the  cathode,  reaching  the  anode  side  (pixel  contacts  first)  when  the  bulk  resistance
becomes  negligible.  At  high  absolute  bias  (>100  V),  the  negative  and  positive  branches  of  I-V  curves  behave  similarly.
Because of the surface effects, we cannot estimate the specific resistivity of the CZT for the pixels with large gaps between
contacts and grid. For example, the bulk resistivity evaluated for a 250 µm gap pixel was greater that 1011 Ohm-cm (curve 3
in  Fig.  4)  which  is  obviously  an  unrealistic  value.  For  several  I-V  curves,  measured  for  pixels  of  both  the  D1  and  D2
detectors, we extended the maximum applied bias up to +/-400 V. These measurements revealed that above 100-150 V, the
linear portion of the I-V curves is followed by an exponential rise.

Figure 5 shows typical I-V characteristics measured for the D3 detectors. At first glance, these curves look completely
different from those measured for the D1 and D2 detectors. The curves have linear dependencies, with only slight diode-like
behavior  at  low  biases.  Nevertheless,  as  we  describe  below,  we  can  in  fact  use  the  same  physical  model  for  all  detector
groups. For comparison, Fig. 6 shows two representative curves measured for the D1 and D3 detectors. Because of the small
pixel size of the D3 detectors, the measured currents were smaller than those measured for the D1 and D2 detectors at the
same bias. This is the reason for the fluctuation seen at low bias for the D3 detectors.

The I-V curve measured for D4 detectors are very similar to those measured for D3 and we will discuss them later in

We  applied  the  ITD  model  described  in  the  previous  section  to  fit  the  measured  curves.  We  found  that  we  can
reproduce all the measured I-V characteristics accurately. To illustrate the fitting procedures, we selected three representative
I-V  characteristics;  a  positive  branch  of  the  I-V  curve  measured  for  the  D1  detector  (large  contact);  a  negative  branch
measured for the D2 detector (small contacts), and a positive branch measured for the D3 detectors. The experimental curves
(squares) and the evaluated theoretical curves (solid lines) are shown in Figs. 7-9 on a log-log scale. Table 1 summarizes the
magnitude  of  the  parameters  obtained  from  the  least  square  fit,  used  to  calculate  the  theoretical  curves.  As  seen,  the
agreement between the ITD theory and the experimental data is very good. For the D1 curve the χ2 function has a very broad
minimum, and practically any value of VRT between 18 and 70 V provides a satisfactory fit to the data. For the D2 curve the
acceptable  values  of  VRT  range  between  12  and  25  V,  with  χ2  reaching  the  minimum  at  19.9  V.  Finally,  the  I-V  curve
measured for the D3 detector gives 9.7 V for VRT.

For all groups of the detectors, the corresponding values of ND were between 0.2 and 2.5 x1010 cm-3. As seen, the
effective concentration of the ionized donors in the depleted volume is much higher than the concentration of the free carriers
(electrons)  inside  the  undepleted  bulk.  This  is  typical  for  the  highly  compensated  material.  The  correlation  between  the
parameters  ρ,  N,  and  ND  is  also  evident,  This  is  probably  related  to  the  total  impurity  concentration.  We  found  nearly  the
same barrier heights at zero field for all tested contacts, Φ0=0.78-0.79 eV, but very different magnitudes of ϑn and C2. Taking
0.8282 eV for the position of the Fermi level inside the CZT bandgap [19], one can find Vbi~0.03 eV. As seen from Table 1,
there is correlation between the parameters ϑn and C2. This can be attributed to the fact that the larger the thickness of the
interfacial  layer,  the  smaller  the  transmission  coefficient  ϑn,  and  the  higher  the  voltage  drop  across  the  interfacial  layer
(∆VI=C2V).

The ITD theory allows us to understand the factors determining the bulk leakage currents in the high resistivity CZT

detectors. At low voltages, current is always limited by the specific bulk resistivity of CZT, typically 1-5x1010 Ohm-cm. In
the case of the ideal Schottky barrier, the maximum possible current, IMAX, would be equal to the saturation current ISAT across

For comparison, Figs. 7-9 show an ideal Schottky barrier characteristic with the saturation current ISAT. If the interfacial layer
exists between the contact and semiconductor, the current will be significantly reduced due to the factor ϑn at low biases, and
will rise exponentially at very high bias (ϑnVR/VD<<1) because of the barrier height lowering:

As an example, for the D1 and D2 detectors, the measured current already exceeds ISAT. at biases above >500V. The current I,
given by Eq. (22), is obtained in the thermionic limit (ϑnVR/VD<<1), i.e.  when all electrons entering the semiconductor are
rapidly swept by the electric field. However, if the electron drift velocity VD is not fast enough to efficiently remove electrons
from the near contact area, the resulting current will be smaller. In the diffusion limited current case, i.e. when ϑnVR/VD>>1,
and V>VRT, then:

where EC is the electric field strength at the contact, and NC is given by Eq. (11). As for the actual current it is hard to say a
priori if it is thermionic or diffusion-limited. In the general case the current is determined by Eq. (8) from which the diffusion
and thermionic limits can be derived, depending on the ratio ϑnVR/VD.

To illustrate the effect of the interfacial layer on the dark current, we calculated the theoretical I-V curves for two
cases: 1) ϑn=1 and C2=0, i.e. no interfacial layer, and 2) ϑn<1 and C2=0, i.e. no potential barrier lowering. The magnitudes of
the  remaining  parameters  were  taken  from  the  least  square  fit  of  the  experimental  data.  If  no  interfacial  layer  exists  (first
case) the calculated current (curves D in Figs. 7-9) would be diffusion-limited up to very high biases, such that the condition
VR/VD>>1 is satisfied. In other words, the dark current in high resistivity CZT detectors is diffusion-limited if no interfacial
layer exists. Eq. (23) can be rewritten as:

I=eNSµEC, 

NS=NBexp(-Vbi/VTH), 

where  NS  is the free electron concentration near the contact. On the other hand, in  the  diffusion  approximation  the  surface
concentration NS can be expressed as:

where NB is the free electron concentration in the undepleted bulk. Eq. (24) resembles the Ohmic-like dependence but with a
much smaller specific resistivity due to a reduction factor exp(-Vbi/VTH), e.g. for Vbi=0.05 V exp(-Vbi/VTH)=0.15. Thus, in the

applied bias range from 1 to 100V, the measured I-V curve could be misinterpreted as following Ohm’s law, and, as was first
pointed out in Ref. [4], a significant overestimate of the bulk resistivity would be obtained.

If  no  potential  barrier  lowering  is  assumed,  i.e.  C2=0,  the  calculated  I-V  curves,  labeled  T  in  Figs.  7-9,  would
correspond precisely to the termionic-limited current for the detectors D1 and D2, and still be diffusion-limited for D3. As
discussed  previously,  this  is  why,  the  I-V  curves  for  the  detectors  from  groups  D1  and  D2  are  very  different  from  those
measured for D3. It appears that the D1 and D2 detectors have an interfacial layer which makes the condition ϑnVR/VD <<1
exist even at low bias. In contrast, we assume that the D3 detectors have a much thinner layer, with ϑn~1, and, as a result the
current is diffusion-limited up to high bias.

It is interesting to compare the I-V curves measured for D2 (thick interfacial layer) and D3 (thin interfacial layer).
Below  1  V  the  current  measured  for  D3  is  approximately  2  times  smaller  than  D2  because  of  the  difference  in  bulk
resistivities: 2.2x1010 and 4.2x1010 Ohm-cm. On the contrary, around 200 V, the current measured for D2 becomes 3-4 times
smaller, because of the transmission factor ϑn, than that measured for D3. At even higher biases, the exponential rise, due to
the barrier lowering, dominates, and at some point the D2 current exceeds the D3 current again, as seen  in  Figs.  7-9.  It  is
clear that for any operating voltage there should be an optimal thickness of the interfacial layer which provides the minimal
leakage current. However, the most efficient way to reduce the leakage current is, of course, to use contacts with large barrier
heights.

Figure  10  shows  the  I-V  characteristics  measured  for  a  randomly  selected  D1  detector  at  different  detector
temperatures.  We  found  that  the  least  squares  fit  for  each  curve  yields  similar  results  within  the  fitting  errors  for  all
parameters  of  the  Schottky  barrier.  The  solid  lines  represents  the  theoretical  curves  calculated  after  substituting  averaged
values for the fitting parameters. The temperature dependence of the dark current in the range between 20 to 70 C is shown in
Fig. 11 for two cathode biases: 20 and 100 V. The solid line depicts the theoretical curves calculated by using the parameters
found from the previous fit shown in Fig. 10.

5.  Conclusions

that 

the  bulk 

We  have  demonstrated 

I-V
characteristics  measured  for  the  CZT  pixel  detectors  with
Pt  contacts  can  be  explained  by  applying  a  combined
interfacial  layer-thermionic-diffusion  theory  to  a  back-to-
back  Schottky  barrier  system.  By  fitting  the  measured
curves  over  a  5  decade  range  we  obtain  consistent
parameters for the Schottky barrier as well as for the CZT
material. For example, we found the potential barrier of the
Pt contact to be 0.78-0.79 eV.

It appears  that  the  interfacial  layer,  likely  formed
during  the  detector  fabrication  process,  can  significantly
affect  the  I-V  characteristics  of  CZT  detectors  with
blocking  contacts  (Pt  contacts  in  this  case).  The  detector
leakage current is limited by the material bulk resistivity at
low  bias  (<1V).  At  high  applied  voltages,  the  current  is
determined  by  the  potential  barrier  height,  transmission
coefficient through the interfacial layer, and by the barrier
height  lowering  effect  due  to  the  voltage  drop  across  the
interfacial  layer.  If  the  effect  of  the  interfacial  layer  is
small,  the  leakage  current  is  diffusion-limited  up  to  very
high bias, and can resemble ohmic behavior, with effective
bulk resistivity much higher than 5x1010Ohm-cm.

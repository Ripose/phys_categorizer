Abstract—  A  hybrid  photo-detector  (HPD)  consisting  of  a 
photocathode  and  a  multi-pixel  avalanche  diode  (MP-AD)  was 
developed  a  few  years  ago.  Our  previous  studies  showed  that  its 
inherent  potential  for  high  resolution  photon  counting  could  be 
further  enhanced  by  reducing  fluctuations  in  charge  loss  in  the 
dead layer at the entrance of the MP-AD. In this paper, we report 
on  the  improvement  with  the  newly  developed  HPD  whose 
encapsulated  MP-AD  has  a  thinner  dead  layer  than  before.  It  is 
demonstrated  that  the  new  HPD  has  much  better  energy 
to  nine 
resolution,  which  enables  clearer  counting  up 
photoelectrons.  Further  enhancement  of 
the  photocathode 
sensitivity of the HPD is also discussed. 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

MULTI-PIXEL  photon  sensors  with  single-photon 

sensitivity  are  widely  used  in  high-energy  physics 
detectors,  such  as  scintillating  fibers  [1]  or  Cherenkov 
counter  readout  [2],  [3].  Broader  applications  are  expected 
if the sensors can operate in a strong magnetic field [4], [5].

photocathode and a  multi-pixel avalanche diode (MP-AD). 
We succeeded in building an HPD having 8x8 pixels so far 
[6], [7], with a gain as high as 5x104, sufficient to detect a 
single photon with a timing resolution of better than 100 ps. 
Operation in a magnetic field up to 1.5 T was confirmed as

In previous studies [6],  one of  the  important  suggestions  is 
that  the  dead  layer  at  the  entrance  of  the  MP-AD  plays  a 
crucial  role  for  the  energy  resolution.  We  now  demonstrate 
improved performance of the HPD with a new MP-AD having 
a  thinner  dead  layer  compared  to  the  one  (old  MP-AD) 
developed in the previous study. 

II.  STRUCTURE OF DEVELOPED HPD 

    A  schematic  drawing  of  the  newly  developed  HPD  is 
shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  primary  components  of  the  HPD  are  a 
photocathode and an MP-AD. The multi-alkali photocathode is 
formed on the vacuum side of the input window. The MP-AD 
is assembled on the ceramic stem facing the photocathode with 
a small distance of 2.5 mm to minimize the effect of external 
magnetic  fields.  This  proximity  focusing  structure  is  essential 
for vacuum  tubes  to be  used  in  a high  magnetic  field. Output 
pins come out on the back of the stem where a bias voltage to 
the  MP-AD  can  be  applied  or  signals  can  be  extracted.  A 
photograph of the tube is shown in Fig. 2. 

    The  MP-AD  has  a  reach-through  structure  whose 
backside is irradiated by electrons, as shown in Fig. 3. The p+ 
layer is formed on a Si substrate, where the density of p type 
impurity, boron, is high enough to make an ohmic contact. An 
8× 8 array of independent pn junctions, each of which forms a 
pixel,  are  fabricated  on  the  opposite  surface  of  the  p+  layer. 
With careful adjustment of the impurity density of the p layer, 
the  electric  field  around  the  pn  junction  is  high  enough  to 
multiply the collected electrons by the avalanche process. The 
size  of  one  pixel  is  2  mm× 2  mm,  and  the  total  area  is  16 
mm × 16  mm.  An  advantage  of  the  reach-through  structure 
with  back  irradiation  is  that  the  p+  layer  at  the  entrance  of 
electrons can be thinned without practical difficulties, because 
it  is  independent  of  the  pn  junctions  governing  the  delicate 
avalanche multiplication.   

In  response  to  incident  photons,  electrons  are  emitted  from 
the photocathode, accelerated and hit the MP-AD. Each of the 
electrons  gives  rise  to  ionization  there  and  produces  an 
electron-hole  pair  for  every  3.6eV  of  the  deposited  energy, 
amounting to thousands of pairs. This multiplication is referred 

 

to  as  electron-bombarded  gain.  The  generated  electrons  then 
drift  along  the  electric  field  inside  the  MP-AD  toward 
individual pn junctions, where each electron induces avalanche 
multiplication, which is read out though the output pins. 

The previous study [7] suggests that p+ layer at the entrance 
forms  a  dead  layer  and  the  energy  deposited  there  does  not 

to 

the  electron-bombarded  gain.  Since 

contribute 
the 
fluctuation of deposited energy in the dead layer predetermines 
the  overall  energy  resolution,  the  thinnest  possible  dead  layer 
is desirable. In this study, a thinner dead layer than before[6] is 
realized  by  low  energy  implantation  of  a  p-type  impurity, 
boron.

A.  Electron-bombarded gain 
The electron-bombarded gain was evaluated as a ratio of the 
output  current  from  the  MP-AD  to  the  photocurrent  from  the 
photocathode  at  an  avalanche  gain  of  unity.  The 
electron-bombarded  gains  of  HPDs  with  the  new  MP-AD 
(black  circles)  and  the  old  one  (open  triangles)  are  shown  in 
Fig.  4,  as  a 
function  of  photocathode  voltage.  The 
electron-bombarded  gain  is  improved  from  1600  for  the  old 
MP-AD to 2100 for the new type at a photocathode voltage of 
–9kV.

Fig.  4.    Electron-bombarded  gains  of  HPDs  with  the  new  MP-AD
(black circles) and the old one (open triangles) are shown as a function of
the  photocathode  voltage.  The  electron-bombarded  gain  is  improved  from
1600  (old  one)  to  2100  (new  one)  at  the  photocathode  voltage  of  –9kV.
Gains  were  simulated  by  varying  the  thickness  of  the  dead  surface  layer.
The best fit for the new AD is obtained with a thickness of 80nm, as shown
by solid line, whereas for the old one the best fit is obtained with 210nm, as
shown by dotted line.

  The  electron-bombarded  gain  was 

the 
expectation from the simulation code, PENELOPE [8], which 
can simulate transport of low energy electrons and photons. By 
adjusting the thickness of the dead layer in the simulation, we 
found  that  a  thickness  of  80  nm  gives  the  best  description  of 
the  new  MP-AD,  whereas  210  nm  is  best  for  the  old  one,  as 
shown in Fig. 5 with solid and dotted lines, respectively. The 
disagreement  between  data  and  simulation  for  the  old  type  in 
the  low  voltage  region  may  be  the  result  of  the  simple 
assumption that no electrons generated in the dead layer could 
reach  the  avalanche  region.  The  agreement  is  better  for  the

less energy is deposited in the dead layer.   

pixel  contained.  Without  a  bad  pixel,  the  avalanche  gain 
reaches 100, as shown in [7]. 

B.  Avalanche gain and leakage current of MP-AD 
For the measurements of avalanche gain and leakage current, 
all pixels were connected in parallel to sum up the signals from 
the  pixels.  Fig.  5  shows  avalanche  gains  of  the  new  MP-AD 
(solid  line)  and  the  old  one  (dotted  line)  measured  with 
incident  photoelectrons  at  a  photocathode  voltage  of  –8kV. 
The  AD  gains  are  almost  the  same  within  the  deviations 
expected  for  the  variations  in  the  impurity  density  of  the  p 
layer facing the n+ layer, which would significantly change the 
electric field in the avalanche region, and thus affect avalanche 
gain greatly. The maximum reachable avalanche gains of these 
MP-ADs  are  limited  by  the  breakdown  voltage  of  the  worst 

New AD

Old AD

Leakage  currents  for  the  new  MP-AD  and  the  old  one  as  a 
function  of  the  bias  voltage  are  shown  in  Fig.  6.  There  is  a 
rapid increase of the current for the new MP-AD around 200V 
due  to  a  bad  pixel.  Below  the  breakdown  point,  the  new 
MP-AD  shows  an  order  of  magnitude  higher  leakage  current 
than that of the old one. It is possible that the thinner p+ layer 
may not be sufficient to prevent thermal charges from flowing 
out  as  an  excess  dark  current.  Further  optimization  of  the 
process is in progress. 

C.  Pulse height spectrum for multi-photons 
The  pulse  height  spectra  for  multi-photons  were  measured 
with  HPDs  illuminated  by  a  pulsed  LED  of  470  nm.  A 
charge-sensitive amplifier and a linear amplifier with a shaping 
time of 0.5µs was used to readout the signal from the one pixel 
while the other pixels were connected to the ground. Both the 
HPD with the new MP-AD and the old one were operated with 
the same total gain, approximately 4.5× 104 at a photocathode 
voltage of –9 kV. 

The results are shown in Fig. 7, where the black curve is the 
data with the new MP-AD, and the gray curve with the old one. 
The pulse height spectrum is improved drastically for the HPD 
encapsulating  the  new  MP-AD  with  the  thinner  dead  layer. 
This improvement clearly proves our conjecture on the energy 
resolution of the HPD.

wavelength  was  500  nm.  The  voltages  on  the  photocathode 
and the MP-AD were –8 kV and 250V, respectively, for a total 
gain of 4.5× 104.

Fig. 8.    Relative output of each pixel measured by scanning a spot of
light  over  the  center  of  each  pixel  is  shown.  The  standard  deviation
normalized to the average output is 6.0%. 

The relative output from each pixel is shown in Fig. 8. The 
standard deviation among them is 6.0%, when it is normalized 
to the average output signal. This uniformity is better than the 
value  of  30%  reported  for  a  multi-anode  PMT  commercially 
available  [3].  Sources  of  this  non-uniformity  are  attributed  to 
the photocathode sensitivity, the electron bombarded gain and 
the avalanche gains as reported in [6], [7]. 

IV.  EFFORT TO IMPROVE PHOTOCATHODE SENSITIVITY 

Some attempts are being made to adapt a photocathode with 
a higher sensitivity made of GaAsP crystal to the HPD. Since 
the  mean  free  path  of  electrons  in  the  crystal  is  long,  the 
photocathode  can  be  thick  enough  to  absorb  photons  without 
major  loss  of  excited  electrons  diffusing  to  the  vacuum  side. 
The  negative  electron  affinity  of  the  GaAsP  photocathode 
leads to high emission probability from the crystal to vacuum. 
The  GaAsP  photocathode,  thus,  can  achieve  high  sensitivity 
for photons.   

The  best  quantum  efficiency  (QE)  curve  measured  for  the 
preliminary  test  tubes  with  a  GaAsP  photocathode  (solid 
curve)  is  shown  in  Fig.  9,  together  with  that  of  multi-alkali 
photocathode (dashed line) for reference. The sharp cut-off of 
the  GaAsP  photocathode  around  300nm  is  due  to  the 
transmission  characteristics  of  the  borosilicate  glass  used  for 
the input window to match its thermal expansion coefficient to 
the  GaAsP  crystal,  while  no  such  cut-off  is  observed  with 
quartz  glass  used  for  the  multi-alkali  photocathode.  This 
demonstrates that the QE of a GaAsP photocathode can be as 
high as 60%. The existing prototype HPD with the same type 
of photocathode shows the QE of 32% for now. Optimization 
of the photocathode process to the HPD is still in progress.

V.  SUMMARY 

Performance of a newly developed HPD with an avalanche 
diode is compared with that encapsulating a diode [9], as listed 
in Table I. A remarkable feature of the new HPD is one order 
of  magnitude  higher  gain  than  the  one  with  the  diode,  even 
with  lower  photocathode  voltage.  This  enables  single  photon 
detection  with  high-speed  amplifiers,  which  have  inherently 
large noise. 

Features  of  a  HPD  with  AD  are  further  enhanced  by  the 
thinner  dead  layer  at  the  entrance  of  the  AD.  Thanks  to  the 
smaller  fluctuations  of  the  energy  deposit  in  the  layer,  the 
energy resolution is drastically improved and is now sufficient 
to  clearly  identify  up  to  nine  photoelectrons.  It  is  also 
demonstrated that a high quantum efficiency (up to 60%) HPD 
can be made with a highly sensitive GaAsP photocathode.

Abstract.

A new non-parametric statistic is introduced for the characterization of deviations of the
distribution of seismic energies from the Gutenberg-Richter law. Based on the two first
statistical log-moments, it evaluates quantitatively the deviations of the distribution of scalar
seismic moments from a power-like (Pareto) law. This statistic is close to zero for the Pareto
law with arbitrary power index, and deviates from zero for any non-Pareto distribution. A
version of this statistic for discrete distribution of quantified magnitudes is also given.  A
methodology based on this statistics consisting in scanning the lower threshold for earthquake
energies provides an explicit visualization of deviations from the Pareto law, surpassing in
sensitivity the standard Hill estimator or other known techniques.  This new statistical
technique has been applied to shallow earthquakes (h ≤ 70 km) both in subduction zones and
in mid-ocean ridge zones (using the Harvard catalog of seismic moments, 1977-2000), and to
several regional catalogs of magnitudes (California, Japan, Italy, Greece). We discover
evidence for log-periodicity and thus for a discrete hierarchy of scales for low-angle dipping,
low-strain subduction zones with a preferred scaling ratio γ=7±1 for seismic moments,
compatible with a preferred scaling ratio of 2 for linear rupture sizes, and consistent with
previous reports. We propose a possible mechanism in terms of cascades of fault
competitions.

Key words: Gutenberg-Richter law, non-parametric statistics, deviation of distribution from
standard law, discrete scale invariance, log-periodicity

1.Introduction

    The famous Gutenberg-Richer (G-R) size-frequency law gives the number N of
earthquakes of magnitude larger than mW (in a large given geographic area over a long time
interval) (Gutenberg and Richter, 1954). Translating the magnitude mW=(2/3)(log10MW
–16.1) in seismic moment MW=µ U A expressed in dyne-cm (where µ is an average shear
elastic coefficient of the crust, U is the average slip of the earthquake over a surface A of
rupture), the G-R law gives the number N(MW) of earthquake of seismic moment larger
than MW. The striking empirical observation is that N(MW) can be modeled with a very
good approximation by a power law

(1a)                                            N(MW) ~ 1/ (MW)β,

The Gutenberg-Richter law (1a) is found to hold over a large interval of seismic moments
ranging from 1020÷1024 (mW=2.6-4) to about 1026.5 dyne-cm (mW=7). Many works have
investigated possible variations of this law (1a) from one seismic region to another and as a
function of magnitude and time. Two main deviations have been reported and discussed
repeatedly in the literature:

1)  from general energy considerations, the power law (1a) has to cross-over at a “corner”
magnitude to a faster decaying law. This would translate into a downward bend in the
linear frequency-magnitude log-log plot of (1a). The corner magnitude has been
estimated to be approximately 7.5 for subduction zones (SZ) and 6.0 for mid-ocean
ridge zones (MORZ) (Pacheco et al.,1992), (Okal and Romanowicz, 1994) but this is
hotly debated (see below);

2)  the exponent β is different in SZ and in MORZ (Pisarenko and Sornette, 2003a). There
is in addition a controversy among seismologists about the homogeneity of β-values in
different zones of the same tectonic type. Some seismologists believe that β-values are
different at least in several zone groups, others find these differences statistically
insignificant.

     The authors  ( Main and Burton, 1984; Rundle, 1989; Romanowicz, 1994; Pacheco et
al., 1992; Pacheco and Sykes, 1992; Romanowicz and Rundle, 1993; Okal and
Romanowicz, 1994; Sornette et al., 1996; Kagan, 1997; 1999; Sornette and Sornette, 1999)
proposed that the large-magnitude branch of the distribution can be modeled also by a
power-like law and that the crossover moment or magnitude between these two
distributions can be connected with the thickness of the seismogenic zone. Pacheco et al.
(1992) claimed to have identified a kink in the distribution of shallow transform fault
earthquakes in MORZ around magnitude 5.9 to 6.0, which corresponds to a characteristic
dimension of about 10 km; a kink for subduction zones is presumed to occur at a moment
magnitude near 7.5, which corresponds to a downdip dimension of the order of 60 km.
However, Sornette et al. (1996) have shown that this claim cannot be defended
convincingly because the crossover magnitude between the two regimes is ill-defined.
Pisarenko and Sornette (2003a,b) suggested new statistical tests to find deviations of

earthquake energy distribution from the Gutenberg-Richter law at extreme range and use
the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) to characterize tails of energy distribution in
this range. In particular, using a transformation of the ordered sample of seismic moments
into a series with uniform distribution under the assumption of no crossover and applying
the bootstrap method, Pisarenko and Sornette (2003b) estimated  a crossover magnitude
mW=8.1± 0.3 for the 14 subduction zones of the Circum Pacific Seismic Belt. Such a large
value of the crossover magnitude makes it difficult to associate it directly with a
seismogenic thickness as proposed by many different authors in the past. The present paper
can be seen as a continuation of the study begun in  (Pisarenko and Sornette, 2003a,b), but
we stress that this continuation is based on a quite different non-parametric approach, in
contrast to the parametric methods previously developed.

There is a second important novelty here. Complementary to these previous works

emphasizing deviations from the G-R distribution only in the tail, the present paper
explores the possible existence of deviations from (1a) elsewhere, that is, in the bulk of the
distribution. This becomes possible by our introduction of a new statistic, which turns out
to be very sensitive to deviations from a pure power law. Namely, we suggest a non-
parametric statistic that is close to zero for “pure” G-R laws, and deviates from zero at
energy sub-ranges with large enough deviations from the G-R law. This is a first attempt to
address the problem of characterizing deviations in the whole range of seismic moment
sizes, including moderate and small events, with the hope of connecting such hypothetical
deviations with tectonic and geological particularities of the zones in question.

Deviations of a pure G-R power law can take a priori many shapes. It has been

recognized with the development of the concept of fractals (Mandelbrot, 1982) that power
laws are the hallmark of the symmetry of continuous scale invariance (CSI) (Dubrulle et
al., 1997 and references therein). Deviations of a pure G-R power law thus express some
degree of breaking of this CSI symmetry. As for any other symmetry, there are many ways
to break the CSI symmetry. One of them is particularly interesting because it constitutes a
minimalist way of breaking the CSI symmetry: it corresponds to keeping the scale
invariance but only for specific scales organized according to a discrete hierarchy with
some fixed preferred scaling ratio γ. The lower symmetry thus obtained is called “discrete
scale invariance” (DSI) (Sornette, 1998 and references therein). Going from CSI to DSI
corresponds to a partial breaking of the CSI, conceptually similar to the partial breaking of
continuous translational invariance in liquids into discrete translational invariance in
solids. In the present paper, our new statistic unearths a DSI structure decorating the G-R
power law, which is the most apparent for low-strain low-angle dipping subduction zones.
This is particularly interesting because it complements from a novel angle with a different
data set previous reports of DSI in crack growth (Ouillon et al., 1996; Huang et al., 1997),
rupture and fragmentation (Sadovskii, 1999; Geilikman and Pisarenko, 1989; Sahimi and
Arbabi, 1996; Johansen and Sornette, 1998; Suteanu et al., 2000);  and seismicity
(Sornette and Sammis, 1995; Newman et al., 1995; Saleur et al., 1996). We elaborate on
the implication of this finding in the discussion section.

   The organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we describe the new statistic
tailored for studying deviations from the G-R law and summarize its main properties (for
continuous variables such as seismic moment). In Section 3, we present a similar technique
for catalogs with quantized magnitudes, as they are usually given in seismic catalogs (for
instance in 0.1 magnitude units). In Section 4, we apply these statistics both to some

simulation examples and to the Harvard catalog of seismic moments. In Section 5, we
apply the discrete version of our statistic to several regional catalogs. Section 6 presents a
discussion of our results and concludes.

2. TP-statistic and its properties.

It is well-known that, in terms of (scalar) seismic moments, the G-R law coincides with the
Pareto distribution F(x), allowing us to rewrite (1a) as

(1) 

F(x) = 1 – (u/x)β , x ≥ u, β > 0,

where  u is a lower threshold, and β is the power index of the distribution. Let us consider
a finite sample x1,…, xn. It is desirable to construct a statistic TP = TP(x1,…, xn) such that,
asymptotically for large n, TP would be close to zero and, at the same time, would deviate
from zero for samples whose distribution deviates from eq.(1). Let us construct such
statistic based on the first two normalized statistical log-moments of the distribution (1).
Using the symbol E for the mathematical expectation, we have

(2)     E log(X/u) =    ∫

 log(x/u) dF(x) = 1/β ;

(3)      E log2(X/u) =    ∫

 log2(x/u) dF(x) =  2/β2.

Thus, if we choose

TP = (1/n) ∑

n

=
k 1

 log(xk/u) )2 – (0.5/n)  ∑

 log2(xk/u),

n

=
k 1

then according to the Law of Large Numbers and equations (2)-(3), the statistic TP tends to
zero as n →∞ . In order to evaluate the standard deviation std(TP) of the statistic TP,  we
rewrite (4) in the form:

(5) 

TP = (1/n) ∑

n

=
k 1

[log(xk/u) -E1] + E1)2 – (0.5/n)  ∑

[log2(xk/u)- E2] - 0.5E2,

n

=
k 1

where E1, E2 are the expectations of log(xk/u) and log2(xk/u) respectively (for Pareto
samples, E1, = 1/β  and E2 =2/β2). Both sums in eq.(5) are of the order n -0.5 :
[log(xk/u) –E1] ∝ n -0.5 ; ε2 =1/n ∑

[log2(xk/u) -2/β2] ∝ n -0.5

                ε1 =1/n ∑

n

n

=
k 1

Thus, if n is large enough, we can expand TP in eq.(5) into Taylor series up to terms of the
order n -0.5  in the neighborhood of E1 and E2 respectively:

(6) 

                                      TP ≅ (E2

1 -0.5E2)+2E1ε1 –0.5 ε2 .

This provides an estimation of std(TP) by the standard deviation of the sum:

(7) 

2E1ε1 –0.5 ε2 = (2 E1 /n) ∑

[log(xk/u) -E1] – (0.5/n)∑

[log2(xk/u)- E2] =

                                    = (0.5 E2 - 2 E2

[2 E1 log(xk/u) – 0.5 log2(xk/u)].

The standard deviation of the last sum in (7) can be estimated by

 (8)                                     n -0.5 std[2 E1 log(xk/u) – 0.5 log2(xk/u)],

and  the standard deviation std of the term in bracket in eq.(8) is estimated through its
sampled value [2 E1 log(xk/u) – 0.5 log2(xk/u)]. Equation (8) provides an estimate of
std(TP) if we replace E1 by its sample analog:
                                                      (1 /n) ∑

log(xk/u).

Fig. 1 shows the TP-statistic as function of the lower threshold u, applied to a simulated
Pareto sample of size n=5000 with power index β = 2/3 generated with u=1 as defined in
Eq.(1). Keeping fixed the synthetically generated data, for a given lower threshold u, we
select all data values that are larger than u and calculate TP using only these values above
u. Varying u allows in principle to test different part of the distribution. If the lower
threshold u is smaller than 300, the TP-statistic does not deviate significantly from zero.
Beyond this value (for which there are less than 150 data values), random fluctuations
become large as TP is estimated with a smaller and smaller number of data.

Fig. 2 shows the TP-statistic applied to a sample generated with the distribution function
F(x) formed by two jointed Pareto branches with different power indices:
                                                  1 – 1/xb1;        1≤ x≤ c;

(9)                   F(x) =
                                                 1 – cb2-b1 / xb2;        c ≤  x ,
with  β1= 2/3,  β2= 3.5  and c=300. The behavior of the TP-statistic in this case is quite
different from that observed for a single pure power shown in Fig. 1. First of all, in the
lower and middle part of the range, TP is shifted up by 0.2 – 0.3. Then, beyond the value h

= 100, a rather steep descent starts ending with almost zero value at h=300. The difference
between these two distributions thus leads to strong distinguishing signatures.

    Having in mind the problem of DSI that we shall encounter in our investigations below,
we illustrate the application of the TP-statistic to simulated samples generated by a Pareto-
like distribution with log-periodic oscillating deviations from an exact Pareto law. Namely,
the chosen distribution function is defined by:

                                 1 – C1(b,∆b) /xb+ ∆b

 ;        k⋅∆l ≤  log10(x) < (k+1/2)⋅∆l;

(10)           F(x) =                                                                                               k=0,1,…
                                1 – C2(b,∆b) /xb - ∆b

 ;      (k+1/2)⋅∆l ≤  log10(x) < (k+1)⋅∆l.

The theoretical tail of this distribution function with b=0.67; ∆b=0.2; ∆l=0.75 is shown in
Fig.3a (∆l is the log10-period of the DSI oscillations, as it is seen from Eq.(10),
corresponding to a preferred scaling ratio 10∆l=5.62); C1, and C2 are normalizing constants
depending on  b,∆b. With ∆b=0.2, the oscillations are hardly observable on the graph.
Fig.3b shows a sample analog of the tail function constructed from a simple of size
n=5000 generated with the DF (10). Fig.3c shows the TP-statistic as a function of the
lower threshold u applied to the above sample. We see that the DSI oscillations are very
strong and distinguishable despite some noise disturbances (in particular, at large lower
thresholds u). Note that the maxima and minima of the log-periodic oscillations shown in
Fig.3c correspond to the points of changing slopes shown in Fig3a: local maxima of Fig.3c
correspond approximately to the transition from slope (b+∆b) to slope (b-∆b), and local
minima to the transition from (b-∆b) to (b+∆b).

3. TED-statistic for discrete exponential distribution.

   Many catalogs measure earthquake sizes with discrete magnitudes rather than with
continuous seismic moments. Accordingly, the G-R law is an exponential distribution
when earthquake sizes are expressed in magnitudes. In this section, we address the
problem of constructing a statistic similar to TP for a quantized exponential distribution.
Let us consider the (shifted) exponential distribution:

(11)             F(x) = 1 – exp (- (x-u)/d );    x ≥ u,

where d is a scale parameter. Let us assume furthermore that the distribution (11) is
quantified with a step ∆ providing discrete probabilities:

(12)            pk = F(u+k∆) - F(u+(k-1)∆) = exp(-(k-1)∆/d) - exp(-k∆/d),   k = 1,2,… .

Suppose further that, in a given catalog of magnitudes, there are mk , mk ≥ 0, values  within
the interval  (u+(k-1)∆ ; u+k∆), k=1,2,…, so that

(13)

m1 + m2 +…+mk +…= n,

where n is the total number of observed magnitudes (sample size). We can consider the
sample (m1 , m2 ,…mk …) as the result of n independent trials of discrete rv ξ taking values
1,2,…,k,… with probabilities (12). The first two moments of the rv ξ are :

(14)       M1 = ∑

k pk =1/(1- exp(-∆/d) );     M2 = ∑

k2 pk =(1+exp(-∆/d)/(1- exp(-∆/d))2.

∞

∞

=1k
Denoting λ =exp(∆/d) we get:
(15)                                        M1 =λ/(λ-1);                  M2 =λ/(1+λ)/ (λ-1)2 .

=1k

We derive from the first equation in (15):

(16)             λ = M1 /( M1 –1),

and from the second equation in (15):

(17)

λ = (M1 +M2)/(M2 – M1).

Replacing the theoretical moments M1 , M2  by their sample analogs
k mk/n ; M*2 = ∑

M*1 = ∑

k2 mk/n ,

(18)

∞

∞

=1k

=1k

 in Eqs.(16),(17), we get two different estimates of λ whose difference converges to zero in
probability as n→∞. This results from the fact that M*1 ,M* 2  are consistent estimates of
M1 , M2  for any value of the unknown scale parameter d. This provides the looked-for
TED- statistic:

(19)

TED = (M*1 +M*2)/(M*2 – M*1) - M*1 /( M*1 –1).

Our remaining task is to derive a consistent sample estimate of the standard deviation
std(TED of the statistic TED defined by (19). For this purpose, we use the formulae
derived in (Rao, 1966) for the variance of limit normal distributions for sample moments
of a multinomial distribution. The variance of the limit normal distribution of TED can be
estimated as follows. Let us denote by U1, U2 the following statistics:

(20)

(21)

U1= 1 /( M*1 –1)2 +2/(M*2 – M*1) +2 M*1 /(M*2 – M*1)2 ;
U2= 2 M*1 /(M*2 – M*1)2 .

Then, the variance of the limit normal distribution of TED can be consistently estimated by
the following expression (see for details (Rao, 1966), Chapter 6, Section 6a.1):

(22)              var(TED) ≅  ∑

k2 (mk/n) (U1- kU2)2 –[ ∑

k (mk/n) (U1- kU2)]2 .

4. Application of TP-statistic to the Harvard catalog of seismic moments.

   Let us consider first the Harvard catalog of (scalar) seismic moments for the time period
1977-2000, and for shallow events (h ≤ 70 km). Only earthquakes with seismic moments
larger than 1024 dyne-cm are considered to ensure a tolerable completeness and
homogeneity. The total number of earthquakes in all 14 considered subduction zones (SZ)
is 4609, whereas the total number of events in midocean ridge zones (MORZ) is 1286.
More detailed information on the seismic moment data can be found in (Pisarenko and
Sornette, 2003a).

4.1. TP-statistic of earthquakes in subduction zones (SZ)

The sample tail of SZ events is shown on Fig. 4a. Except for the extreme range, the sample
tail function 1-F(x) looks like a straight line in double log-scale, i.e. the G-R law seem to
apply. At the very extreme end of the range of seismic moments, a “bend down” can be
observed, but there is no strikingly visible deviations from a straight line in the middle part
(the careful reader may however notice the existence of an oscillation of very small
amplitude). Fig. 4b shows the TP-statistic applied to the subduction sample. Regular
oscillations on a noisy background are now obvious. In addition, the TP-statistic is
translated upward by 0.1-0.2 which, by comparison with the synthetic test (9) shown in
Fig.2, is probably the signature of the bend down in the extreme range. By comparing Fig.
4b with Fig. 1, it is clear that the TP-statistic with a moving lower threshold provides a
rather sensitive method for detecting deviations from the G-R law. We can already
conclude from this analysis that the distribution of earthquake moments exhibits significant
deviation from the pure power law, not only in its tail but also, in a major portion of the
scaling region. In a quantitative form, this evidence can be considered as a new claim. The
comparison of the oscillations observed in Fig. 4b with those of the synthetic test in Fig. 3c
suggests that the deviation of the distribution of seismic moments from the G-R law can be
modeled by log-periodic oscillations, reflecting a DSI partial breaking of CSI. For
comparison, we show on Fig. 4c the so-called Hill’s estimates of the power index β as

function of  the moving lower threshold u (see e.g. Embrechts et al.,1997, for details on the
Hill’s estimators). The oscillations of the power index are hardly observable on this graph.

  

4.2. TP-statistic of earthquakes in mid-ocean ridge zones (MORZ)

Earthquakes in MORZ can be divided into two main groups according to their source
mechanism: events with normal fault mechanism (spreading areas), and events with strike-
slip mechanism (transform areas). These two groups differ quite remarkably by their
source mechanism as well as by their total energy. We thus treat them separately. We have
performed the corresponding classification using the technique of triangle diagram, as
described in (Kaverina et al.,1996). A small number of events could not be classified with
this technique due to uncertain characteristics of the source. We thus obtain 926 transform
events and 360 spreading events. The corresponding sample tail functions are shown in
Figs. 5 and 6. In these cases, deviations from the G-R law can be seen with the naked eye:
the tail functions are convex, except for the four largest spreading events in Fig. 6 that
should be discussed separately (this goes beyond of scope of the present paper). Figs. 7 and
8 show the TP-statistic for these two MORZ samples. As it could be expected, deviations
from zero are significant in both cases, confirming significant deviations from a pure
power law both in the bulk and in the tail of the distributions.

4.3. DSI in the TP-statistic of earthquakes in subduction zones

Let us come back to the oscillations observed in Fig. 4b for the distribution of event sizes
in subduction zones. While they are significant, can they be related to any geophysical
characteristics? We are going to suggest such a tentative geophysical interpretation if these
oscillations are genuine, acknowledging in the same time that a definite conclusion on this
subject needs more detailed study based on a more representative data.

 The seismic and stress-strain regimes in active transitional zones are believed to be
determined mainly by the mechanical coupling between the downgoing slab and the
overriding continental plate. The dip angle is known as one of factors affecting the
mechanical coupling (Jarrard, 1986). It seems reasonable to suggest that the increase in
the mechanical coupling promotes both an increasing seismic activity and a more
noticeable log-periodicity.

     To perform a quantitative analysis, we use a pre-existing classification of subduction
zones constructed by  Jarrard  (Jarrard, 1986), based on a set of geological and tectonic
characteristics (29 parameters), of which  we select the following main 5 parameters:

-intermediate dip up to 100 km of depth (in degrees);

-strain class (in an abstract discrete scale from 1 to 7);

-convergence rate (in cm/year);

-mean slab age at trench (in  m.y.);

-maximum moment magnitude Mw .

Jarrard (1986) provided the corresponding 5 parameter values for each of his 39
subduction zones. To obtain the 5 parameter values for each of our 14 subduction zones,

each one often made of several zones considered by Jarrard, we averaged the
corresponding parameter values over all Jarrard’s zones constituting each of our zones.
The resulting values of the 5 parameters for each of our 14 subduction zones 5 are given in
Table I. We then consider each of the 5 parameters one by one. For each parameter, we
classify all 14 zones into two groups with approximately equal numbers of elements in
accordance with “relatively high” (H), or “relatively low” (L) values of the parameter. This
provides us with 5 different partitions of 14 zones marked in Table I as (L) and (H). We
group all earthquakes of the zones in the “high” (respectively “low”) group of a given
partition and apply the TP-statistic to this “high”  (respectively “low”) group separately.
Fig. 9a shows that the group with “low” dips is characterized by significant log-periodic
oscillations of its TP-statistic, whereas no oscillation can be observed in the TP-statistic of
the “high” dip group (Fig. 9b). Similar differences in the TP statistics of the “low” and
“high” strain classes are found (see Fig. 10a and 10b). The classification using the three
other parameters does not give noticeable differences between the H and L classes. This
suggests that the log-periodic oscillations are associated with low dip and low strain
subduction zones in the middle part of the slab (60-100 km depth). From the measure of
the period in the logarithm of the lower threshold, we infer a preferred scaling ratio γ=7±1.
In order to compare the sensitivity of the TP-statistic and of Hill’s estimates, Fig. 11a and
Fig. 11b show  Hill’s estimates of the power index β for low and high dip, that should be
compared with Figs. 9a and 9b. Oscillations are hardly seen, if any.

    The origin for log-periodicity may be due to a mechanism similar to that found in
growing antiplane shear faults (Huang et al., 1997) according to the following mechanism.
With simple subduction zone plate bending, intraplate outer rise earthquakes are mostly
due to tensional failure at shallow depths. The location of the plate bending corresponds to
the location of stress concentration constituting the most favorable loci for earthquake
nucleation and fault growth. We visualize a system of faults more or less parallel to the
subduction boundary. As the plate undergoes its subduction, faults compete with each
other to accommodate the growing strain: nearby faults screen each other. This
competition between two neighboring faults imply that one of them will start to grow faster
and be more active while the other one slows down, being screened by the first one. As this
process can occur at all scales, this leads to a cascade of Mullins-Sekerka instability as
demonstrated in (Huang et al., 1997) by analytical as well as numerical calculations: from
an initial homogenous population of faults, the cascade of growth instabilities create a
discrete hierarchy of fault lengths with a scaling factor between successive levels of the
hierarchy close to 2. Thus, we can assume that earthquakes reveal these discrete hierarchy
of faults. As seismic moments are approximately proportional to the cube of the rupture
length, this predicts a preferred scaling factor of 23=8 for seismic moments. This value is
compatible with our measurement γ=7±1, as seen from Figs. 9a and 10a. We stress that the
mechanism of competition between growing and reactivated faults operates both for
normal as well as for transform faults and is not restricted to antiplane shear faults. Our
proposed mechanism rationalizes our finding that a DSI fault network should be more
apparent for low-strain low-angle dipping subduction: only then can a large delocalized
lateral zone of faulting be created with many sub-parallel faults interacting and competing.
Large dipping angles localize the region of competing faults to a narrow scale range,
preventing the observation of log-periodicity.

    We recall that all these considerations are tentative since the number of different
subduction zones under analysis (14) is too small to draw a definite conclusion.

5. Application of TED-statistic to catalogs with discrete magnitudes.

   Let us now illustrate the application of the TED-statistic introduced in section 3 to the
global NEIC catalog as well as to the regional catalogs of Japan, California, Italy and
Greece, all reported with discrete magnitudes (the discrete magnitude bins are in all cases
0.1 of the magnitude unit). The sample magnitude-frequency curves (MFC) and
corresponding TED-statistic as a function of the lower threshold u are shown on
Figs. 12a-e and 13a-e correspondingly.

On the MFC of the global NEIC catalog, there is no visible feature except for a downward
bend at the extreme range, starting near M=7.5. On the TED-graph, there is a
corresponding increasing TED-statistic with an acceleration at the extreme range. Thus, the
tail of the sample MFC deviates more and more strongly downward from the G-R law as
one penetrates further in the tail of the distribution. One could say that this global catalog
is “too heavily averaged” to find any other significant characteristic deviation from the G-
R in the middle part of range.

   Regional catalogs reveal more structures in their TED-graphs. The sample MFC for
Japan is visibly a convex function with a small downward bend at the extreme range. On
its corresponding TED-curve, besides the extreme upward bend, one sees two small
“troughs” near M ≅ 5.75 and M ≅ 6.9. The nature of these troughs is unclear. In the small
and intermediate range 3 ≤  M ≤  5.75, the TED-curve is almost horizontal (a small
negative shift is probably due to the final downward bend of the MFC). It thus seems that
the G-R law for Japan in the middle part of range is fulfilled satisfactorily.
   The MFC of the California catalog has a slightly convex form in the range 1 ≤  M ≤  3
that can be explained by the partial incompleteness of the catalog in this range. This fact is
reflected by a positive deviation of the TED-curve in this interval. Above M ≅ 3, the
completeness of the catalog seems satisfactory, and the TED-curve remains near zero till M
≅ 5, where a smooth increase starts interrupted by two “humps” near M ≅ 5.9; 6.3 (a
“trough” near M ≅ 6.7 does not seem reliable because of the large std). In the central part
of the range 3 ≤  M ≤  5, deviations from the G-R law are small.

   The MFC of Italy exhibits some deviations caused by the practice of a human operator to
prefer magnitude values that are multiples of 0.5. Small local minima corresponding to
such magnitude values are hardly detectable in the MFC, but they are clearly observed in
the TED-curve, sometimes with small shifts. Indeed, one can discern small but quite
definite minima near M ≅ 3; 3.5; 4.1; 4.6; 5; …. A “hump” near M ≅ 5.7-5.8 is seen, but it
cannot be ascertain due to the large std.
    The MFC of Greece exhibits the same “operator” minima as described for Italy at M ≅
4.1; 5.1; 6.1. They are “compensated” by neighboring maxima. It seems evidently, that
these minima/maxima are not connected with natural sources, but what is strange is that
they are shifted by ≈0.1-0.2 magnitude unit with respect to integer numbers. The reason of
this shift is not quite clear. One possible explanation can be following. The regional

seismological networks rather frequently use the local ML magnitude scale and  mb  values
obtained from  the high-frequency  seismic wave range.  For the examined magnitude
range (from 4 up to 5.5), if being recalculated to the world-wide used low-frequency  mb
scale  both  ML  and high-frequency mb values will be increased by about 0.2, see for
example, (Sobolev, 1993). The TED-curve behaves quite satisfactorily except for the small
minima/maxima mentioned above and the steep upward bend at the extreme range. With
this exception, deviations from the G-R law in the range 3.4 ≤  M ≤  6.7 are not large.

   Thus, unlike the Harvard catalog of seismic moments, we did not find noticeable
oscillations in magnitude catalogs. The four local catalogs (Japan, California, Italy and
Greece) are characterized by very complex boundaries and we would not expect the simple
mechanism of competing faults to be as clearly apparent due to the probable effect of
averaging over different fault orientation and fault mechanism: indeed, previous studies
have shown that log-periodicity can only reveal DSI if adequate steps to prevent the
destruction of the oscillations by averaging are taken (Johansen and Sornette, 1998). The
situation is not improved by the use of discrete magnitudes as it is well known that
techniques of measuring earthquake size by magnitude is less accurate as compared with
the method of seismic moments. Different Magnitudes are based on measurements of
maximum amplitudes on seismograms registered by seismometers with different frequency
ranges. Besides, many magnitude catalogs have had a long evolution of measurement
procedures, thus causing some non-stationarity in the registered time-series of observed
magnitudes. Quantifying magnitudes with step 0.1 can lead to inaccuracies for the
determination of earthquake energies, but probably with not too serious consequences
(except for the measurement of log-periodicity). Of course, larger steps, say of 0.25, are
able to cause appreciable undesirable effects. To check this, we have converted the
Harvard seismic moments (for all 14 subduction zones, n=4609) into discrete magnitudes
in units of 0.1 and have applied to them our TED-statistic (see Fig. 14). We obtain very
weak maxima which, while corresponding to the strong maxima described above for the
continuous TP-statistic, are barely statistically significant with the TED-statistic. We
observe the same phenomenon with synthetic log-periodic power laws of seismic
moments, when transformed in discrete magnitudes. Thus, the quantization of magnitudes
decreases strongly the efficiency of the detection of log-periodic oscillations. Thus, for
detailed statistical analysis of deviations from the G-R law, the Harvard catalog of seismic
moments is preferable to the magnitude catalogs, despite the fact that magnitude catalogs
cover longer time intervals.

     In order to complete comparison of discrete magnitudes with continuous seismic
moments on the same events, we have taken magnitude values reported in the Harvard
catalog just for the same events that were used in our subduction sample (n=4609). There
are two magnitudes in the Harvard catalog: magnitude mb determined from body wave
measurements, and magnitude Ms determined from surface waves. Unfortunately, Ms is
reported only for 88-90% of all events, which makes unreasonable using this magnitude for
our comparison. Thus, we compared the seismic moments M with two versions of
magnitudes: mb and Mmax = max(mb ; Ms ). Fig. 15a,b show sample tails of distributions of
these magnitudes. We see that the mb-tail is a convex curve, thus visibly disobeying the G-
R law, whereas the Mmax-tail looks in the middle range (5.5; 7.5) rather satisfactorily. Fig.
16a,b show the TED-statistics for these two magnitude distributions. On the TED for mb,
weak traces of peaks at mb ≅ 6.1; 6.6; 7.1 still can be discerned, whereas there is no visible

peaks at these magnitudes on the TED for Mmax. Thus, we can conclude once more that the
catalog of seismic moments is preferable for detailed statistical treatments as compared
with magnitude catalogs.

6. Discussion and Conclusions

   We have suggested a T-statistic of a new type measuring quantitatively the deviations
from the  G-R law expressed both as a function of seismic moments and as a function of
discrete magnitudes. This statistic can be displayed as a function of a lower threshold. In
this respect, it is similar to the well known mean excess function e(u), see e.g. (Embrechts
et al.,1997):

(23)

e(u) = E( X-u | X > u).

This function was introduced as a useful statistical tool to characterize tails of distributions.
For power-like tails, it behaves as a straight line with positive slope; for exponential tails, it
is a constant, and so on. Our statistic (for continuous distributions) is based on two mean
log-excess moments l1(u), l2(u):

(24)                l1(u) = E ( log(X/u) | X > u);      l2(u) = E ( log2(X/u) | X > u).

   For discrete magnitudes with exponential distribution (the G-R law), in addition to (23),
the second mean excess moment e2(u) in discrete form was used:

(25)

e2(u) = E( (X-u)2 | X > u).

   These T-statistic based on statistical moments are not local characteristics of
corresponding densities, they are characteristics of a cumulative type, referring to the tail
on the interval (u, ∞). Thus, they do not answer to question “at what location a particular
sample differs from the G-R law?”, but rather to “what part of the extreme tail differs from
the G-R law?”. We gave examples of the application of the T-statistics to several
previously well-studied earthquake catalogs. Because of its cumulative property, the T-
statistic is, generally speaking, more stable than local characteristics of deviations from a
given law. The T-statistic permits to judge on the deviation of an integral tail portion from
the G-R law, but it is not tailored specially to work with the limit extreme behavior of the
tail. For the latter, we had suggested other methods in  (Pisarenko and Sornette, 2003a,b),
and we hope to continue working in this direction elsewhere.
    Application of the TP-statistic to subduction zones (the Harvard catalog of seismic
moments) permitted to discover some heterogeneities in the seismic moment-frequency
curve. They are exhibited more explicitly for subduction zones with low dip angle and with
low stress. We cannot say definitely what is the nature of these heterogeneities which
appear as oscillations of the TP-statistic in the logarithm of the lower threshold. We can’t
say that we are absolutely free from some doubts that this discovered oscillations are
artifact due to some peculiarities of the algorithms used in the data processing of the

Harvard catalog. We can’t find neither any definite reason for considering our discovered
oscillations as an artifact. So, with these reservations, we shall consider them as a natural
effect. As an explanation of these log-periodic oscillations we can accept that they are the
signature of a discrete scale invariance (DSI) in the seismic catalogs. We suggested a
simple mechanism in terms of competing faults localized in the domain where the bending
of the subducting plate is concentrated.

More generally, if one agrees that the observed log-periodicity is not an artifact and
has a natural cause, we would like to emphasize that log-periodicity is an inherent property
of systems with discrete self-similarity, see (Geilikman and Pisarenko, 1989; Sornette and
Sammis, 1995; Sornette, 1998, Sornette,2000). Thus, we can argue that some physical
field(s) with discrete self-similarity underlies these oscillation effects. These ideas are
close to those suggested by M.Sadovskii in explaining numerous examples of “preferable
sizes” in nature: geological blocks, ground particles, dimensions of rock pieces produced
by explosions, celestial bodies etc., see (Sadovskii,1999). In all these examples, one
observes some “humps” of preferred sizes on a smooth background of the distributions.
According to Sadovskii, the mean log-distance between two neighboring humps (for linear
dimensions of objects, or reduced to linear dimensions) varies from log10 2 =0.3  to
log10 4.5 = 0.65 with average value log10 3 ≅ 0.5. If we take our “humps” on the TP-curves
for subduction zones and transform their values into linear dimensions (assuming that
earthquake energy is proportional to the cubic linear dimension of the source), we get a
log-distance about 0.33 (preferred scaling ratio close to 2 for length scales) which falls into
the interval indicated by Sadovskii.
   Catalogs with discrete magnitudes (quantified with 0.1 of magnitude units) did not show
noticeable oscillations in the TED-statistic. A possible reason lies in less precise
measurements of earthquake sizes by magnitudes as compared with seismic moments, and
in the non-stationarity of catalog time-series. Thus, in our opinion, for detailed statistical
analysis of the type performed here, the Harvard catalog of seismic moments is preferable.
On the whole, the agreement of regional catalogs of large sizes, say, 104 or more, with the
G-R law is satisfactory in all ranges, except at the extreme end which needs a special
study.

We leave for the future the use of our T-statistic for studies of zonal seismic
particularities. This can only be performed under the condition that the corresponding
zonal catalog is sufficiently large (perhaps, no less than 103 events, depending on the range
in question). For zonal catalogs, deviations from the G-R low (if one believes in zonal
validity of the G-R law, and majority of seismologists do believe in such validity) can be
connected with tectonic and geological particularities of the zone in question (see for
instance (Bird et al., 2002)), which is impossible for global catalogs, or catalogs including
several tectonically different areas.

The effect of nonlinearity on plasma wake wave excited

investigated.  It  is  shown  that  owing  to  the  nonlinearity
the  amplitude  of  wake  wave  gets  modulated  in  the
longitudinal  direction.  The  nonlinear  wavelength  in  the
excited field changes in the transverse direction with the
result  that  the  phase  front  is  distored  and  a  turbulence
developed.  The  nonlinear  phase  front  distortion  may  be
compensated  by  radial  change  of  unperturbed  plasma

1  INTRODUCTION
The  plasma-based  accelerator  concepts  are  presently
and
actively 
experimentally.  This  is  due  to  the  ability  of  plasma  to
support  large  acceleration  rates  that  will  reach  tens  of
GeV/m,  far  in  excess  of  those  attained  in  conventional
accelerators.  Charged  bunches  can  be  accelerated  and
focused by the field of relativistic plasma waves that are

Wakefield  Accelerator 
linear
wakefield  and  1D  nonlinear  theories  have  been  studied
in  sufficient  detail  (see  e.  g.  overview  in  Ref.  [1]).  The
allowance for finite transverse sizes of the drivers (that is
more  realistic  case)  and,  accordingly,  the  transverse
motion  of  plasma  electrons  complicate  the  treatment  of
the problem in the nonlinear regime. In the general case
the  analytical  solution  of  this  regime  seems  impossible
and  the  use  of  numerical  methods  are  usually  required.
Here  we  study  the  effect  of  nonlinearity  on  two-
dimensional  plasma  wake  waves  as  well  as  discuss  the
cause of radial steepening of the field shown in Ref. [2].

3  THE CASE OF WIDE BUNCH
Consider the case of wide bunch (kprb>>1, where rb is the
bunch  radius)  when  the  transverse  components  of  an
exciting field are small and the longitudinal components
close to the bunch axis are approximately equal to those
predicted by one-dimensional nonlinear theory. Here one
can  apply  the  perturbation  method  taking  the  1D
nonlinear mode as the ground state. So, for wide bunches
in uniform plasma [Np(r)=1] we shall seek the solution of
Eqs.  (1)- (6)  in  the  vicinity  of  bunch  axis  in  the  form:

      It  was  shown  numerically  based  on  Eq.  (8)  that
although the amplitude of excited transverse components
is small, their wavelength is nearly equal to that of one-
dimensional  nonlinear  wave.  The  amplitude  of
oscillations periodically changes with z (see Fig. 1). The
modulation  depth  grows  and  the  modulation  period
decreases  as  the  amplitude  of  nonlinear  longitudinal
oscillations  increases.  These  effects  take  place  also  for
other components of the field.

direction.  Note  also  an  enlargement  of  the  range  of
focusing forces (fr<0) in the nonlinear wake wave.
      It  is  easy  to  see  that  due  to  the  dependence  of  the
wavelength  on  r,  the  field  in  the  radial  direction  grows
more chaotic as the distance from the bunch increases. In
fact,  the  oscillations  of  plasma  for  different  r  are
“started” in the wake wave with nearly equal phases but
different  wavelengths.  As  |z|  increases,  the  change  of
phase  in  the  transverse  direction  (for  fixed  z)  becomes
more  and  more  marked.  This  leads  to  a  curving  of  the
phase  front  and  to  “oscillations”  in  the  transverse
direction. Curve 1 in Fig. 3 shows the radial behavior of

Qualitatively,  the  radial  dependence  of  the  field  differs
from  that  of  the  linear  case  by  the  change  of  sign  and
“steepening”  of  fields  along  r  (see  also  Ref.  [2]).  One

    The  magnetic  field  strength  in  the  nonlinear  two-
dimensional wake wave as shown in Fig. 2(c) is different
from zero (note that in the linear case Hq =0 in the wake,
where  the  wave  is  potential)  due  to  the  fact  that  the
velocities  of  plasma  electrons  in  the  wave  are  not  any
more  small  in  comparison  with  the  bunch  velocity.  The
magnitude of higher frequency oscillations (as compared
to  the  plasma  frequency)  performed  by  the  magnetic
field  along  z  grows  in  proportion  to  the  nonlinearity.
Such  a  behavior  of  magnetic  field  is  a  purely  nonlinear
effect.  The  nonlinearity  of  the  wave  implies  a  rise  of
higher harmonics in Pz and Pr. According to (7), the rise
of  magnetic  field  is  due  to  these  harmonics  and  this
accounts  for  frequent  oscillations  seen  in  Fig.  2(c).  On
the  other  hand,  according  to  (7),  the  non-zero  magnetic
field  in  the  wake  means  that  the  motion  of  plasma
electrons  in  the  nonlinear  wave  is  turbulent  (rotP„ 0).
The  degree  of  turbulence  (the  measure  of  which  is  Hq )
grows as the nonlinearity.
      From  the  viewpoint  of  acceleration  and  focusing  of
charged  bunches  in  the  wave,  the  curvature  of  the
nonlinear  wave  front

(emittance,  monochromaticity)  of  the  driven  bunch

plasma one can avoid the curvature of the wave front.

5  RADIALLY-NONUNIFORM PLASMA
Thus, in two-dimensional nonlinear regime the nonlinear
wavelength  changes  with  r  due  to  nonlinear  increase  of
the wavelength with wave amplitude. On the other hand,
the  linear  wavelength  l
-1/2  decreases  with  density  of
plasma. Let us  assume  that  the  nonlinear  wavelength  of
the  two-dimensional  wake  wave  in  the  uniform  plasma
(r)  is  known.  Then,  one  can  roughly  compensate  for
the  radial  variation  of  the  nonlinear  wavelength  by
changing the unperturbed density of plasma in the radial
direction according to the relation

If we put the function L
(r) to be Gaussian (according to
numerical data for profiles (9), this is approximately the
case  at  least  for  r<s
r),  then  one  can  take  the  transverse
profile  of  the  unperturbed  plasma  density  to  be  also
Gaussian: np(r)= np0 exp(- r2/s

that in this case s

numerical data  for  L

assertion (see also Fig. 3, curve 2).
   Numerical solutions obtained for the case of nonlinear
wake  wave  excitation  by  a  short  laser  pulse  (Laser
Wakefield Accelerator, see e.  g.  Ref.  [1])  show  that  the
results given in this work do not change qualitatively.

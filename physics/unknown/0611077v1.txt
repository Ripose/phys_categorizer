Assuming the concept of aether non-entrained by translational motion, one 
can provide a rational explanation of the experimental processes affecting 
the  measurement  of  time  when  clocks  are  in  motion.  Contrary  to  special 
relativity, aether theory does not assume that the time itself is affected by 
motion; the reading displayed by the moving clocks results from two facts: 
1/ Due to their movement through the aether, they tick at a slower rate than 
in  the  aether  frame.  2/  The  usual  synchronization  procedures  generate  a 
synchronism discrepancy effect. These facts give rise to an alteration of the 
measurement  of  time  which,  as  we  shall  show,  exactly  explains  the 
experimental results. When the measurement distortions are corrected, the 
time is shown to be the same in all co-ordinate systems. Although it makes 
reference to previous studies, this text remains self sufficient. 

 
 
I. Introduction 
In  the  present  text,  the  points  of  view  of  special  relativity  and  aether  theory  regarding  the 
measurement  of  time  in  moving  co-ordinate  systems  are  successively  presented  and 
compared.  The  measurement  concerns  the  two  way  transit  time  of  light  along  a  rod 
perpendicular to the direction of motion. We show that the approach of aether theory we have 
developed in ref [1], can give a rational explanation of the experimental processes affecting 
this measurement, but, contrary to special relativity, these processes do not result from time 
dilation, but rather from the slowing down of clocks moving through the aether and from the 
synchronism  discrepancy  effect  caused  by  the  usual  synchronization  procedures.  After 
correction of these measurement distortions the true value of the time in moving co-ordinate 
systems  is  rediscovered.  This  study  gives  an  illustration,  in  a  specific  example,  of  the 
differences separating relativity and aether theory.  
(We  should  bear  in  mind  for  the  reader  not  informed  of  our  approach,  that  the  concept  of 
aether assumed in this text conforms to the Lorentz views: it is associated with a privileged 
aether  frame  and  is  not  entrained  by  the  motion  of  bodies.  It  is  this  approach  that  we  shall 
refer to as “aether theory” all through the text).

 This classical expression is interpreted as time dilation by special relativity. 
 
III. Clock retardation according to aether theory. 
The theory on which this study is based, assumes the existence of a preferred frame in which 
the aether is at rest. The one-way speed of light is C in the aether frame, and different from C 
in all other frames moving with respect to the aether. Yet, as we saw in ref [1] and [3], due to 
measurement distortions (that shall be evoked in the text which follows), it is found to be of 
magnitude C in all ‘inertial’ frames and in all directions of space. 
Contrary  to  relativity  theory,  the  motion  of  bodies  does  not  affect  the  time,  but  the  motion 
through the aether causes a slowing down of the moving clocks. 
The real two-way transit time of light, along a rod attached to a certain ‘inertial’ frame, is the 
same for the observers of all frames, but, due to clock retardation, the reading displayed by 
clocks moving relative to the rod will depend on their speed with respect to the aether frame 
[1-3]. We shall study successively two different cases: in section III.1 the clock reading in a 
moving  ‘inertial’  co-ordinate  system  is  compared  to  the  time  in  the  aether  frame;  this  case 
introduces to the section III.2 which puts forward exhaustively the differences between aether 
theory and relativity. 
 
III.1. In this section we shall compare the clock readings in two ‘inertial’ co-ordinate systems 
as we did in section II, but from the point of view of aether theory. The only difference is that 
the co-ordinate system 
 is assumed to be at rest in the aether frame where the clock reading 
is the real time (Fig 1). Since the line AB is the path of the light signal in the aether frame, the 
speed of light is C along this line. 
Referring to the transit time of light along AB, displayed by a clock attached to frame
0t

According to the aether theory, clock retardation is defined with respect to the aether frame; 
the  ratio  between  the  time  displayed  by  clocks  at  rest  in  the  aether  frame  and  the  reading 
. The 
displayed by clocks moving at speed v is assumed to be equal to equal to

experimental implications of this assumption will be studied in the text that follows.

where the suffix ‘app’ means apparent.  
This  formula  assumes  the  same  mathematical  form  as  the  time  dilation  formula  of  special 
 is not 
relativity; yet its meaning is quite different because, contrary to special relativity,

, it is the clock reading displayed by clocks slowed 

the true time in the co-ordinate system 
down by motion.  
(We remark that in the aether frame there is no difficulty to synchronize the clocks, since the 
speed of light is assumed to be isotropic in this frame, while this is not the case in the other 
frames). 
(We also bear in mind that, if we assume the existence of a preferred aether frame, then, real 
frames  are  never  perfectly  inertial,  the  term  ‘inertial’  is  an  approximation  which  must  be 
limited  to  the  cases  where  the  absolute  speed  of  the  frames  under  consideration  is  low 
compared to the speed of light. See ref [1]). 
 
III.2.We  now  propose  to  study  a  different  case:  we  shall  determine  the  clock  retardation 
formula between two co-ordinate systems 
receding with rectilinear uniform motion 
and 
with respect to the co-ordinate system which is attached to the aether frame. The direction 
of motion is the x-axis (see fig 2).

Therefore if clocks are exactly synchronized, there is an obvious difference between the two 
theories.

III.2.2. Practical consequences of the clock synchronization procedures used. 
We should note that, in practice, in order to determine the duration of a cycle in  we must 
subtract  the  reading  displayed  by  clock  A  when  the  signal  starts  from  this  clock,  from  the 
reading displayed (after reflection in B) by clock A’ ,when the signal reaches this clock, and 
therefore we must synchronize the clocks A and A’ beforehand. 
According  to  aether  theory  if  the  synchronization  of  clocks  was  perfect  we  would  have 
obtained formula (5). Yet, synchronizing the clocks perfectly is a difficult problem, and, with 
the usual synchronization procedures, (Einstein-Poincaré method or slow clock transport), we 
make  a  systematic  error  in  measuring  the  time,  (synchronism  discrepancy  effect)  [2-4]  (see 
below). 
The apparent duration of a cycle measured in
2

is therefore equal to the difference between 
  and  the  synchronism  discrepancy  effect  (SDE)  that  will  be  derived  in  the  text  which 

t1
app
follows. 
Even  if  the  SDE  cannot  always  be  easily  determined  with  our  current  technology,  we  can 
calculate  it  and  determine  how  it  modifies  the  measurement  of  the  time  transformation 
obtained  when  clocks  are  exactly  synchronized  (expression  (5)).  The  result  will  then  be 
compared with the time dilation formula of special relativity. 
Referring to the SDE that would affect the clocks if they were not slowed down by motion 
as

, the SDE affecting the clocks attached to the coordinate system is: 

1S

Δ

1S

The  apparent  (measured)  two-way  transit  time  of  the  signal  (from  A  to  B  and  to  A’)  is 
therefore:

It is this apparent time which is in fact measured when a SDE between the clocks A and A’ 
exists. 
 
Derivation of the synchronism discrepancy effect, and clock synchronization. 
In  order  to  synchronize  clocks,  we  generally  use  the  Einstein-Poincaré  synchronization 
procedure with light signals or the slow clock transport method which has been shown to be 
equivalent to the former by several authors [1,4]. After determining the length  
AA’, the Einstein-Poincaré method consists in sending a light signal from clock A to clock A’ 
along the x’-axis, at an arbitrary instant where the reading of clock A is set at t= zero. After 
reflection in A’, the signal comes back to A. The clocks are considered synchronous if upon 
reception of the signal by A, clock A’ displays a reading equal to half the reading of clock A.  
the length that would be assumed by the segment AA’ if it was at rest in the

it is reduced to 
                                                                                        (8)

This  result  is  different  from  formula  (5)  which  was  the  exact  clock  retardation  formula 
according to aether theory. Yet, it is the experimental formula obtained in practice due to the 
measurement distortions. 
(Note  that  this  formula  assumes  a  different  mathematical  form  from  formula  (11).  This 
difference results from the fact that in the co-ordinate system 
the time is measured at the 
same point at the beginning and at the end of a cycle).

This  formula  has  the  same  mathematical  form  as  the  time  dilation  formula  (2)  of  relativity 
theory,  but  obviously  its  meaning  is  quite  different.  In  particular  we  have  not  assumed  the 
invariance of the one-way speed of light.

IV. Conclusion 
The  comparison  of  formulas  (6)  and  (7)  demonstrates  that  relativity  and  aether  theory  are 
fundamentally  different.  Nevertheless,  paradoxically,  due  to  the  systematic  measurement 
distortions caused by the commonly used synchronization procedures, aether theory leads to a 
clock reading given by formula (13), which presents a mathematical form identical to formula 
(2); yet for relativity, the formula is regarded as exact, while for aether theory it results from 
the measurement distortions. 
In  conclusion,  the  choice  of  one  theory  rather  than  the  other  is  not  simply  a  question  of 
philosophical preference.

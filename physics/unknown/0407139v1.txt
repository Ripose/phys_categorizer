  This  paper  gives  a  brief  outline  of  the  progression  from  the  first  substorm  model 
developed in [Ponomarev, 1985; Sedykh, Ponomarev, 2002] based on C.F. Kennel’s ideas, 
to the present views about the mechanism by which solar wind kinetic energy is converted 
to electromagnetic energy at the Bow Shock and by which this energy is transferred to the 
magnetosphere  in  the  form  of  current;  about  the  transformation  of  the  energy  of  this 
current  to  gas  kinetic  energy  of  convecting  plasma  tubes,  and,  finally,  the  back 
transformation  of  gas  kinetic  energy 
in  secondary 
magnetospheric MHD generators. 
The  questions  of  the  formation  of  the  magnetospheric  convection  system,  the  nature  of 
substorm  break-up,  and  of  the  matching  of  currents  in  the  magnetosphere-ionosphere 
system are discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 
We  suggest  a  description  of  magnetospheric  processes  in 
the form of a physical model consisting of three blocks(see 
Fig.1): 
1.  Block of electric current generation in the Bow Shock 
where the Solar Wind (SW) energy converts to electric 
energy.  The direction of the generated electric current 
depends  on  the  sign  of  the  IMF  Bz-component.  This 
current closes through the magnetospheric body in the 
form  of  the  dawn-dusk  current  (if  Bz<0).  It  is  this 
current which sets convection in motion(by an Ampere 
force). 

2.  Block of gas pressure relief formation. 

The  combined  action  of  convection  and  pitch-angle 
diffusion [Kennel, 1969] leads to the formation of the 
gas  pressure  relief  and,  hence,  to  the  production  of  a 
system  of  bulk  and  field-aligned  currents  in  the 
magnetosphere,  as  well as to the formation of particle 
precipitation

2. BLOCK OF ELECTRIC CURRENT GENERATED IN 
THE BOW SHOCK 

 
  The  solar  wind  undergoes  the  greatest  change  of  its 
parameters  during  the  passage  through  the  shock  wave 
front. Its density in this case increases by a factor of four, 
and gas and magnetic pressures increase more than an order 
of magnitude. 
  The  Bow  Shock  (BS),  separating  the  Solar  Wind  (SW) 
region  from  the    Transition  Layer  (TL)  is,  as  shown  in 
[Ponomarev et al., 2000,2003], a transformer that converts 
the solar wind kinetic energy to electric energy. As a result, 
under the shock wave there arises a current sheet separating 
the region of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) of the 
solar wind from the magnetic field of the transition layer. If 

the  vertical  component  of  the  IMF  is  in  the  solar  ecliptic 
coordinate  system,  Bz  <  0,  then  the  current  under  the  BS 
flows in the clockwise direction.  
Fig.  2  shows  a  portion  of  the  bow  shock,  the  transition 
layer, and of the fore part of the magnetosphere. 
 

laboratory  coordinate  system,  on  the  contrary,  it  increases 
to [VxB]/c. 
Because after the relaxation of the field inside the layer the 
boundary with surface charge has displaced into the plasma 
(in a time t1 ~ 2π/ωB) to a distance on the order of ξ, all that 
has  been  described  above  is  repeated.  Obviously,  this 
signifies  the  penetration  of  the  electric  field-associated 
momentum into the plasma with the velocity of sound. Here 
is how convection starts to form (see Fig. 3).

  We  now  briefly  discuss  the  conditions,  which  must  be 
satisfied 
the 
magnetosphere. Let at the initial time the electric current be 
homogeneous and directed along the axis y. If at a certain 
time the current jo increases by δj outside the volume under 
consideration, then a charge with surface density µ = ∫ δj dt 
starts to form on its boundary. The resulting electric field E 
will  give  rise  to  a  displacement  current  jc  =  (ε/4π)⋅∂Ε/∂t, 
that creates an Ampere force which is balanced only by the 
inertial  force,  because  the  corresponding  pressure  gradient 
has not yet formed:

               v =  c[E x B]/ B2 ,                                       (2) 

 
(in  view  of  the  fact  that  the  squares  of  the  perturbed 
quantities  can  be  neglected  as  having  the  second  order  of 
smallness). 
The physical meaning of what has been said above implies 
that  the  polarization  electric  field  is  produced  inside  the 
double layer with a thickness on the order of ξ = 2πcs/ωB = 
πc/ωpp,  where  cs  is  the  velocity  of  the  fast  magnetosonic 
wave,  and  ωpp  is  the  proton  plasma  frequency  (such  a 
thickness is characteristic for current sheets in collisionless 
laboratory  and  space  plasmas).  In  the  buildup  process  this 
field produces a displacement current that forms an Ampere 
force,  which  accelerates  the  plasma  inside  this  layer. 
Whereas  in  the  buildup  process  the  electric  field  in  the 
plasma  coordinate  system  drops  to  zero  and  in  the

If there are no losses in plasma and divV=0, then the story 
ends up with this. The plasma receives the momentum from 
the  electric  field,  corresponding  to  the  velocity  of  steady-
state convection. 
No stationary electric current is produced in this case. But if 
the  volume  is  bounded  by  the  walls  or  if  it  contains  an 
inhomogeneous  magnetic  field,  then  primary  convection 
undergoes  restructuring,  with  the  possible  formation  of  a 
pressure  gradient,  the  existence  of  which  implies  that  an 
electric  current  arises  in  plasma.  This  does  implies  the 
penetration of the external current into plasma. 
Next,  we  consider  the  formation  of  a  pressure  gradient 
caused  by  plasma  compressibility.  From  the  continuity 
equation we have: 

 
            ρ′ = -ρо ∫ div V dt                                             (3) 

 
The  integration  goes  over  the  entire  time  of  convection 
formation t2. Therefore (3) may be written as: 

 
    ρ′ = ρo (V∇pB/pB)t2 ~ ρo(V/LB)t2                           (4) 

 
The  perturbation  of  pressure  p′  is  determined  from  the 
equation of state: 

 

                 p′ = cs

2 ρ′,                                                 (5)

importance 

in 

In view of the fact that the velocity of fast magnetosound in 
the magnetosphere is virtually equal to the Alfvén velocity, 
we find: 

 

                    ∇p′ ~ -ρo cs

2Vt2/L2~ F ,                        (6) 

 
where F is the Ampere force. Since V ~ Ft1/ρo, from (6) it 
follows that: 
 

                t1t2 = L2/cs

2                                                (7) 

 
This  relation  relates  the  size  of  the  system  to  the  settling 
time  of  a  stationary  distribution  of  pressure,  i.e.  to  the 
formation  of  a  gas  pressure  gradient.  This  is  known  to 
determine the current in plasma. 
In other words, t2 is the characteristic time of penetration of 
the electric current into the plasma volume. Assuming for t1 
-1 ~ 1 s, L ~ 1010 cm, and for cs ~ 3⋅108 cm/s, then for t2 
= ωB
we find the time of ~1000 s. Such a duration of the transient 
process  for  the  magnetosphere  is  unobjectionable.  It  turns 
out  that  our  system  has  three  characteristic  times:  t1=2π/ω 
that  characterizes  the  time  of  electric  field  buildup  “at  a 
point”, t2 is the time of penetration of the electric field into 
the volume, and t3 = L/cs is the settling time of the electric 
field in the system of the size L. It should be noted that the 
gas  pressure  gradient  is  also  produced  when  the  magnetic 
field  is  homogeneous  but  there  is  a  wall  that  confines  the 
motion  of  plasma.  Furthermore,  the  expression  (7)  retains 
its form, and the time t2 acquires an illustrative character. It 
is  simply  the  filling  time  of  the  volume  between  the  wall 
and the point that is at a certain distance from the wall, with 
plasma moving with the velocity V toward the wall. 
  What has been said above suggests an important physical 
conclusion.  The  process  of  penetration  of  current  into 
plasma is a two-stage one. Initially, the polarization field is 
produced,  which  penetrates  into  plasma  “layer  by  layer”. 
Or, more exactly, the momentum corresponding to this field 
penetrates 
is 
inhomogeneous, the flow can redistribute pressure in such a 
manner that an electric current arises in plasma because of 
the  appearance  of  gradients.  Energetically,  this  current  is 
necessary for maintaining convection in the inhomogeneous 
system. In fact, from the relation: 
 
                   V∇p = jE ,                                              (8)

if 

 
it follows that current is necessary for maintaining flow in 
an  inhomogeneous  medium.  If  (8)  is  integrated  over  the 
volume  of  the  system,  we  see  that  in  a  stationary  case  the 
consumed power: 
 

W = ∫ UV∇p dU = ∫ UdivS dU =∫ ∑S d∑ = ∫ ∑ψj d∑ ,    (9) 

 
where  U  and  Σ  are  the  volume  and  surface  area  of  our 
system, and Ψ is the surface potential. It is obvious that if 
the surface is closed and equipotential, i.e. ψ can be taken 
outside  the  integral  sign,  then  the  system  is  energetically 
isolated from its surroundings - no energy can be “pumped 
in”  (or  “pumped  out”),  since  ψ∫ ∑  jd∑  =0.  This  was 
demonstrated  by  Heikkila  [1997]  .  We  use  (9)  to  estimate 

the  power  brought  into  the  magnetosphere  by  our  current, 
with  an  appropriate  potential  difference.  When  ∆ψ  ~  600 
CGSE, jB ~ 5⋅10-5 CGSE [Ponomarev et al.,2000] and Σ ~ 
1020 cm2, for W we obtain the value on the order of 3⋅1018 
ergs/s,  which  corresponds  to  the  value  adopted  for  the 
perturbed state of the magnetosphere. 
     We  have  repeatedly  stressed  that  equation  (8)  has  a 
profound physical meaning. If Ej>0, the electric forces do 
work  on  plasma.  Plasma  in  this  case  moves  toward 
increased pressure, that is, it is compressed. Otherwise the 
expanding  gas  produces  an  electric  power.  In 
the 
magnetosphere  there  are  MHD  compressors  as  well  as 
MHD  generators  (see  Fig.  1)  [Ponomarev,  2000;  Sedykh, 
Ponomarev, 2002].  If their combined output were identical, 
then 
the 
the  energy  balance  would  be  zero  and 
magnetosphere  would  not  need  any  external  energy 
sources.  In  fact,  inside  the  magnetosphere  is  a  constant 
energy consumer, the Earth’s  ionosphere. It is known that 
the energy flux density through the surface is proportional 
to the electric field component tangent to this surface. 
It  is  obvious  that  in  this  way,  by  changing  the  degree  of 
nonequipotentiality 
the 
magnetosphere  can  control  the  energy  supplied  externally. 
And the importance of this issue is thus. One can imagine 
that the intensity of magnetospheric processes is determined 
by  the  power  alone,  which  is  “offered”  by  the  external 
source.  Yet  it  may  also  be  assumed  that  there  exists  also 
some regulator that permits the passage only a certain part 
of the “offered” power. Further, if this regular is linked to 
the consumer, then we have a very stable natural system.  
  Thus, the bow shock can be a sufficient source of power 
for  supplying  energy  to  substorm  processes.  The  direction 
of  current  behind  the  BS  front  depends  on  the  sign  of  the 
IMF Bz-component [Ponomarev et al., 2000,2003]. It is this 
current  which  sets  convection  in  motion.  Any  change  in 
external  current  through  the  magnetosphere  causes  a 
convection  restructuring  within  a  time  on  the  order  of  the 
travel 
the 
magnetopause  to  the  center  of  the  system,  because  the 
restructuring wave comes from both flanks.

3. BLOCK OF GAS PRESSURE RELIEF FORMATION 
 
  It  is  known  that  the  combined  action  of  convection  and 
strong  pitch-angle  diffusion  of  electrons  and  protons  is 
responsible for the formation of gas pressure distribution in 
the  magnetosphere[Kennel  C.F.,  1969;  Ponomarev  E.A., 
1985],  that  is,  steady  volume  currents.  The  divergence  of 
these volume currents brings about a spatial distribution of 
field-aligned  currents, 
i.e.  magnetospheric  sources  of 
ionospheric current systems. We now consider this issue in 
slightly  greater  detail.  It  is  known  [Ponomarev, 1985] that 
the contents of the magnetic flux tube (MFT) to be referred 
to  as  the  plasma  tube  (PT)  throughout  the  text,  transfers 
from one MFT to another in the convection process without 
surplus  and  deficiency  in  the  case  where  the  field  lines  of 
the  magnetic  flux  tube  are  equipotential  ones.  This 
idealization  is  quite  realistic  everywhere  apart  from  polar 
auroras. 

     Then,  as  the  PT  drifting  toward  the  Earth  in  a  dipole 
field,  its  volume  decreases  in  proportion  to  L-4,  and  the 
situation is the reverse for density, while pressure increases 
in  proportion  to  ~L20/3.  However,  the  process  of  adiabatic 
compression  is  attended  by  the  processes  of  PT  depletion 
due to pitch-angle diffusion into the loss cone. This process 
is  described  by  the  factor  ~exp(-∫dt/τ)  =  exp(-∫dr/Vrτ)  = 
exp(-∫rdυ/Vυτ). The external current must perform the work 
on  compressing  these  plasma  tubes(by  the  Ampere  force).  
Thus  gas  pressure  has  a  maximum  on  each  line  of 
convection.  In  accordance  with  the  equation  for  pg 
[Ponomarev, 1985], we have:

Here pg is gas pressure, L is the L-coordinate, r = LRe is the 
distance  to  the  Earth  (Re  being  the  Earth’s  radius),  Vr  and 
Vυ  are  the  radial  and  azimuthal  components  of  the 
convection  velocity  of  the  equatorial  trace  of  the  plasma 
tube,  respectively,  and  τ  is  the  characteristic  time  of  PT 
depletion  due  to  pitch-angle  diffusion.  The  initial  pressure 
at a certain boundary L∞ was considered time-independent 
in  [Kennel,  1969].  For  reasons  unknown,  Kennel  did  not 
extended  his  model  to  the  unsteady-state  case.  This  was 
done  by  one  of  us  in  [Ponomarev,  1985,  2000].  A  typical 
gas  pressure  pattern  that  results  through  the  combined 
action of convection and loses, is depicted in Fig. 4a. It has 
the  form  of  an  amphitheater  with  a  clearly  pronounced 
maximum  near  the  midnight  meridian,  and  with  a  sharp 
earthward  “break”.  This  “break”  received the name “Inner 
Edge of the Plasma Sheet”, IEPS.

shows  a  feature  like  a  “gorge”  which  is  produced  during
the  influx  of  a  plasma  disturbance  onto  undisturbed
pressure  relief  (as  a  result  of  the  nonstationarity  of
boundary conditions).

 This projection, like the real oval, executes a motion with a 
change of the convection electric field, and expands with an 
enhancement of the field. In this process the amplitude at a 
maximum increases as the IEPS approaches the Earth. Next 
we consider the case where the boundary conditions in (10) 
are  time-dependent.  Let  the  pressure  on  the  boundary  be 
increased by, say, a factor of two. This “impulse” will start 
to  drift  downstream  with  the  convection  velocity,  with  a 
region  of  double  amplitude  remaining  everywhere  in  its 
wake.  If  the  “impulse”  is  of  short  duration,  then  a  region 
“multiplied  by

downstream.    The  effect  of  multiplication  of  two  spatially 
narrow  signals  is  always  small  apart  from  the  time  when 
their  maximal  coincide.  An  amplitude  “flare”  will  occur 
then.  Just  this  is  the  explanation  for  the  “substorm 
breakup”, a simple, logical corollary of the inhomogeneity 
of the system and motion of plasma [Ponomarev, 2000].

under  the  integral  sign.  It  depends  on  the  angle  of

the contrary, pg = const have a complex configuration. The

the  angle  between  the  normals  to  pressure  contours.  This 
factor eases qualitatively analysis of the current situation.

It seems appropriate to employ in the analysis the region of 
the  “cleft”(or  the  “gorge”)  which  is  produced  when  a 
plasma  disturbance  flows  against  the  undisturbed  pressure 
pattern  (as  a  result  of  the  unsteady-state  character  of 
boundary conditions as mentioned above). This detail of the 
pattern is clearly seen in Fig. 4b. Fig. 7 shows a schematic

two  bands  of  field-aligned  currents  which  direction  is 
opposite  on  different  walls.  On  the  whole,  a  current 
configuration  forms,  which  corresponds  to  the  Iijima-
Potemra  scheme  [Iijima  and  Potemra,  1976].  Importantly, 
the  stream  convection  lines  run  virtually  along  the  axis  of 
the “corridor”, the “corridor” itself is extended with respect 
to  the  pB=const  contours  at  a  small  angle,  and  hence  the 
magnetic  field  inside  it  is  nearly  homogeneous.  For  that 
reason,  the  precipitation  parameter  τ  can  be  considered  a 
constant quantity. 
     In  the  model  of  our  interest,  we  replace  the  “corridor” 
itself  by  a  rectangular  channel  with  perfectly  conducting 
walls overlaid by a conducting “cover”, the ionosphere. We 
compensate  for  the  difference  in  spatial  scales,  which  is 
caused by the convergence of field lines, by a correction of 
parameters.  The  channel  with  a  homogeneous  magnetic 
field  includes  a  steady  flow  of  ideal  plasma  with  a 
corresponding  pressure  gradient.  All  this  is  portrayed  in 
detail in Fig. 8. 
  Let  us  consider  the  phenomena  occurring  in  the  plasma 
“corridor”  on  the  basis  of  a  simple  model.  As  is  evident 
from  Fig.  7,  the  orientation  of  the  “corridor”  is  such  that 
plasma flows nearly along its axis. The corridor is extended 
in  a  longitudinal  direction;  therefore,  the  magnetic  field 
changes little within it. All these factors allow us to replace 
the “corridor” by a channel (extended along the axis Y) of 
width  2D,  length  L,  and  height  H.  The  axis  Y  will  be 
oriented across the channel, and the axis Z along its height, 
as shown in Fig. 8. The channel is filled with ideal plasma 
with  pressure  p0  at  the  inlet  and  p1  at  the  outlet.  The 
magnetic 
field  B  =  {0,0,Bz)  will  be  considered 
homogeneous.  Plasma  with  the  velocity  V  =  Vx(x)  flows 
along  the  axis  X  in  a  positive  direction.  The  walls  of  the 
channel  possess  infinite  conductivity.  The  ionosphere  is 
modeled  by  the  upper  cover  of  thickness  h  with  Pedersen 
conductivity σ.

It is evident from (21) that the current I1 is “organized” by 
the “principle of balance”: all the necessary expenses of the 
ionosphere  in  current  (power)  are  covered  first,  and  what 
remains  leaves  for  the  geomagnetic  tail  region.  As  is 
evident  from  the figures, the current I1 there becomes part 
of the dawn-dusk current. Only a part because there exists 
also the dawn-dusk current JB of a different origin. It is an 
external current with respect to the magnetosphere itself. As 
was shown by Ponomarev et al. [2000], it is produce at the 
Bow  Shock  (BS)  front  through  a  partial  deceleration  of 
solar wind plasma by Ampere’s force with the involvement 
of this current. If the Bz-component of the IMF is less than 
zero,  the  direction  of  this  current  is  such  that,  by  closing

The primes on the differentials signify that the integration is 
performed  over  the  space  of  the  ionosphere.  Furthermore, 
because  of  the  equipotentiality  of  magnetic  field  lines,  the 
electric  field  in  the  ionosphere  EI  is  related  to  the  electric 
field in the magnetosphere by the relation: EIdx′ = Edx. In 
these formulas, c is the velocity of light. 
     In  addition  to  the  current  that  closes  through  the 
ionosphere, a part of the MHD generator’s current can close 
through  the  magnetosphere,  as  is  the  case  with  the 
corridor’s  current  in  Fig.  7.  We  designate  this  current  by 
index 1. Then:

Ampere’s 
pushing 
magnetospheric  plasma  earthward,  toward  an  increase  of 
magnetic  and  gas  pressure  (see  Block  of  electric  current 
generation  in  the  BS).  Thus  the  MHD  compressor  lies  in 
this region (located mostly at 5<L<10 on the nightside, i.e. 
before the gas pressure maximum). It is the gas compressed 
by  the  generator  that  is  supplied  to  the  MHD  channel,  the 
operation  of  which  we  are  discussing  here.  Unlike  the 
channel’s region, the region of the MHD compressor lies in 
the  area  where  the  plasma  is  driven  by  magnetospheric 
convection  to  travel  nearly  radially  to  the  Earth.  From  the 
balance  of  the  gas  pressure  force  and  Ampere’s  force  we 
have:

Lc  and LT are the coordinates of the end and beginning of 
the  area  of  plasma  compression,  and  Bc  is  the  magnetic 
field  strength  at  the  compressor  output.  Further  it  will  be 
assumed  that  Bc=B,  that  is,  the  MHD  compressor  output 
territorially coincides with the MHD generator input.

from the compressor input to output:

then  pressure  at  the  MHD  generator  input  will  correspond

     By integrating (21) over the entire length of the channel 
and assuming that the plasma velocity at the output is much 
smaller  than  that  at  the  input  of  the  MHD  generator,  we 
find:

J B =

                                             (26) 

 

This  means  that  actually  dissipative  processes  can  take 
place  in  the  magnetosphere  only  at  the  expense  of  an 
external source of current (and energy). 
The  whole  of  the  complicated  magnetospheric  “design” 
only  redistributes  currents  and  energy  fluxes  in  space  and 
time. 
Overall,  though,  this  is  an  obvious  inference  as  it  is 
expectable.  The  integrity  of  (26)  in  this  case  implies  that 
this is not merely a declaration now. We can point out the 
limits  of  applicability  of  (26)  as  well  as  the  particular 
processes  behind  the  notions  “steady  state”  and  “unsteady 
state”. 
     We  now  turn  our  attention  to  the  “cross-tail  currents”. 
Let  J1+JB  be  designated  by  Is.  Then  from  (25)  it  follows 
that:

Obviously, the control of the tail current Is proceeds both at 
the  expense  of  a  variation  of  JB  and  at  the  expense  of  the 
variation  of  the  current  of  ionospheric  load  Jσ.  In  a  quasi-
steady situation where J-1dJ/dt <<1, q=1 we have:

                  (28) 

 
Obviously, when JB>Jσ, the cross-tail current increases, and 
the  magnetospheric  magnetic  field  is  observed  to  extend 
into  the  tail.  Otherwise  when  the  ionospheric  load  current 
exceeds  the  external  current,  dJs/dt  <0  and  the  tail  current 
decreases,  a  “dipolarization”  of  the  magnetic  field  occurs. 
The  physical  reason  behind  this  is  the  increase  in 
ionospheric consumption of current because of the increase 
in  of  conductivity  caused  by  an  enhancement  of  auroral 
particle precipitation. 
     Thus  between  the  consumer  of  current  and  energy,  on 
the  one  hand,  and  their  “general  supplier’,  the  external 
current,  there  exists  a  flexible  connection  via  a  “depot” 
represented by current J1. 
  Two  serious  arguments  can  be  adduced  in  favor  of  our 
developed  magnetosphere-ionosphere  coupling  model. 
Indeed,  the  prototypes  of  the  channels  considered  in  this 
study, the plasma “corridors”, lie in the immediate vicinity 
of  the  pressure  maximum,  i.e.  of  the  particle  precipitation 
maximum. It is precisely where electrojets are located. The 
other  argument  implies  that  the  configuration  of  field-
aligned  currents  in  this  case  reproduces  the  picture  of 
inflow  and  outflow  currents  (see  Fig.  6),  which  was 
experimentally established in [Iijima, Potemra, 1976]. 
 

5. CONCLUSION 

 
The  approach  under  development  allows  an  understanding 
of: 
-  How  the  energy  is  derived  from  the  SW,  which  is 
needed  for  magnetospheric  processes,  and  how  it  is 
transferred to the magnetosphere.  

-  How  the  break-up  is  produced.  The  shape  and  spatial 
displacement  of  the  auroral  oval  depending  on  time. 
The location, structure and origin of auroral electrojets. 
-  How  the  magnetospheric  currents  can  be  associated 
with  ionospheric  currents  dependent  on  the  electric 
field and conductivity.

First mirrors will be the plasma facing components of optical diagnostic systems in ITER. 
Mirror surfaces will undergo modification caused by erosion and re-deposition processes [1,2]. 
As  a  consequence,  the  mirror  performance  may  be  changed  and  may  deteriorate  [3,4].  In  the 
divertor  region  it  may  also  be  obscured  by  deposition  [5-7].  The  limited  access  to  in-vessel 
components  of  ITER  calls  for  testing  the  mirror  materials  in  present  day  devices  in  order  to 
gather  information  on  the  material  damage  and  degradation  of  the  mirror  performance,  i.e. 
reflectivity. A dedicated experimental programme, First Mirror Test (FMT), has been initiated at 
the JET tokamak within the framework Tritium Retention Studies (TRS).  
 
Introduction 

About  half  of  all  methods  of  plasma  diagnostics  in  ITER  will  be  based  on  analysis  of 
characteristics  of  electromagnetic radiation  in different  parts of spectrum. Due to high level of 
neutron and gamma radiation, all components of optical schemes nearest to burning plasma must 
be metallic mirrors because, in contrast to characteristics of refractive optical components (lens, 
prisms),  the  optical  properties  of  metals  are  not  significantly  affected  by  both  these  deeply 
penetrating radiation. In each optical scheme one mirror has to be the plasma facing component, 
and just this mirror (first mirror, FM) will be subjected to strongest plasma impact.  

For nearest to plasma mirrors there will be two main reasons resulting in degradation of the 
optical  properties.  (i)  The  long-term  bombardment  of  FM  surface  by  charge  exchange  atoms 
(CXA)  will  result  in  the  increasing  surface  roughness.  (ii)  Another  reason  for  degradation  of 
optical  properties  of  in-vessel  mirrors  is  deposition  of  material  eroded  from  the  components 
subjected to strongest plasma impact.  

Up to recent time the simulation experiments on behavior of in-vessel mirrors were provided 
using small-scale stands [1], but since 2001 the investigations of this problem are included in the 
experimental  program  of  several  large  scale  fusion  devices  and  some  useful  experience  was 
gained.  In  this  paper  the  main  results  obtained  on  LHD,  T-10,  Tore  Supra  and  TEXTOR  are 
analyzed and some details of future experiments on JET are described.   
 
1. LHD 

One  of  the  first  attempts  to  study  the  correlation  between  the  mirror  location  and 
modification of mirror optical properties was made a few years ago for stainless steel (SS) mirror 
samples  exposed  inside  the  Large  Helical  Device  (LHD)  during  the  whole  3rd  experimental 
campaign (July 1999-December 2000) [2]. During that experimental campaign there were about 
10,000  working  discharges  and  about  2300  hrs  of  glow  discharge  cleaning  (in  hydrogen  or 
helium).  

The main peculiarities of LHD operating regimes during this campaign are described in [3]. 
Here  we  note  that  the  graphite  tiles  were  installed  in  the  divertor  areas  in  such  a  way  that  the 
plasma of divertor flows did interact with graphite targets only.   

Below the main results obtained by studying the optical properties and surface composition 

of mirror samples taken out of LHD vessel are presented.  

Three  SS  mirrors  with  size  20x10x1  mm  were  mechanically  polished,  cleansed  in  an 
ultrasonic  bath  filled  with  acetone,  and  then  the  spectral  reflectance  at  normal  incidence  was 
measured  in  the  wavelength  range  200-700  nm.  The  samples  were  installed  inside  the  LHD 
vacuum  vessel  in  locations  indicated  in  Fig.  1  by  numbers  1,  3,  and  5:  the  sample  #1  was 
positioned  near  the  divertor  region,  #3  –  close  the  plasma  edge,  and  #5  –  quite  deeply  in  the 
diagnostic  port  in  the  same  poloidal  cross  section  and  in  the  same  plane  as  #1  (central  plane). 
After  samples  were  removed  the  reflectance  was  again  measured  in  the  same  way,  and  the 
surface of samples were analyzed by several methods: Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), ion 
backscattering  technique  (RBS)  using  1.5  MeV  He+  ion  beam,  scanning  electron  microscopy 
(SEM), profilometry, and ellipsometry at the wavelength 632.8 nm. These data are presented in 
detail in [4].

The photos of Fig. 2 show how mirror samples looked just after finishing their exposure in 
LHD vacuum vessel. As a result of exposure in LHD the reflectance of all samples has changed 
from the identical initial level, Fig. 3.

The  reflectance  of  mirrors  #1  and  #5  dropped  strongly  as  a  result  of  appearance  of  the 
contaminating films. From spectral dependence of reflectance one can conclude that the film on 
sample  #5  is  thicker  than  on  the  #1  sample.  At  the  same  time,  the  reflectance  of  sample  #3 
increased significantly and became close to what is usually observed when after rinsing in a

ultrasonic  bath  the  samples  are  cleaned  by  low  temperature  plasma  of  an  ECH  discharge  in 
deuterium, as shown by solid points (the curve “standard”). This effect is connected with not full 
cleaning  of  all  three  mirrors  before  they  were  installed  inside  the  LHD  vessel  from 
contamination  by  some  organic  film  appeared  due  to  rinsing  samples  in  acetone.  This  initially 
existed film was fully cleaned from sample #3 due to plasma impact but became overcoated by 
new films (to be immured) at samples #1 and #5. The high level of reflectance for mirror sample 
#3 measured  after exposure samples  in  LHD was supported by very high  quality  of surface  as 
follows from profilometry measurements (Fig. 4) and analysis of the SEM photos (not shown).  

 

 
Fig. 4.  Results of profilometry measurement of the surface morphology of the sample #3 
      after exposing in the LHD. 

The optical indices of film on sample #1 measured by ellipsometry at the wavelength 632.8 
nm were found  to  be n=2.5 and  k=0.33 and  the  film thickness ~26 nm.  For sample #5 similar 
data could not be obtained in similar way because of very low reflectance at the wavelength of 
measurement  (Fig.  2).  Therefore  the  initial  thickness  of  this  film  was  estimated  by  providing 
ellipsometrical measurement after the film was partly chemically eroded using deuterium plasma 
of ECH discharge [5] and amounted ~50 nm.  

According to AES analysis, the deposited layer on the #1 sample consisted mainly of C (~40 
atomic %) and Fe (~40 atomic %) but on the #5 sample – the only contaminant registered was 
carbon (~90 atomic %) [4]. The surface of the sample #3 was practically free of carbon however 
a quite small trace of  heavier  metal,  possibly,  copper was registered by  RBS. As follows from 
profile measurements, the layer of ~0.15 µm was eroded from the surface of this mirror sample 
[4]  due  to  plasma  impact:  CXA  during  working  discharge  and  ion  bombardment  during  wall 
conditioning.  

According to  AES  measurements, the thickness  of  deposited  layers  on  the  collector probes 
disposed  close  to  these  mirror  samples  was  ~50  nm  and  ~30  nm  for  samples  #5  and  #1 
correspondingly [2], i.e., in good agreement with ellipsometry data.  
 
1.1. Main results 

Two  mirror  samples  remote  from  the  confined  plasma  became  coated  with  carbon-based 
film. The characteristics and thickness of deposited films are very different: on the mirror placed 
in the divertor region the film was hard and included large portion of iron. Cleaning this mirror 
from  contaminating  film  by  low  temperature  deuterium  plasma  of  an  ECR  discharge  without 
acceleration of ions was not too effective. In contrast, the mirror placed deeply in the port was 
coated  with  soft  C  film  containing  only  small  percentage  of  hydrogen  (~10%).  It  was  much 
easily taken off by exposing to low energy ions of deuterium plasma [4].  

The mirror placed in the nearest location to the hot plasma became to be cleaner than it was 
initially.  The  full  erosion  of  this  sample  found  by  measurement  of  the  surface  profile  did  not 
exceed 0.15µm. Such small net erosion seems surprising if one takes into account the long time 
of  glow discharge  conditioning and large number  of  working discharges.  Probably the balance 
between sputtering by CXA during working discharges and by plasma ions during conditioning, 
on the one side, and contaminant deposition, on the other side, was almost zero, only with minor 
preponderance of sputtering erosion over deposition.  
 
2. T-10 

Polished mirror samples of SS316 (10×10 mm2 and 20×20 mm2, 4 mm thick) were used for 
experiments.  They  were  exposed  in  diagnostic  port  of  limiter  section  of  T-10  at  different 
distances from plasma as shown in Fig. 5 [6]. 

Thin SS shield protected a part of each sample with ~0.1 mm gap between shield and mirror 
surface.  Samples  fixed  in  1-3  positions  were  shutter-protected  during  vacuum  vessel  (VV) 
conditioning. The positions of mirrors 1-6 were frontal to plasma. Besides, in 2003 mirrors 8-9 
were placed edgewise to plasma and one mirror located in frontal position, 7, was shadowed by 
sample 5.  

The typical parameters of T-10 discharge are following:  working gas – deuterium;  plasma 
current – 200-400 kA during 1 s; toroidal magnetic field – 2.8 T; central  electron  temperature  
Te(0)≈1 keV  for  the Ohmic phase and up to 2.5 keV at ECRH;  line averaged electron density in 
the  range  (1-6)×1019  m-3;  central  ion  temperature    near  450-700  eV  at  both  phases.  Usual 
configuration with ring and movable limiters from graphite MPG-8 was used in 2002 but in 2003 
the  ring  limiter  was  taken  away  and  only  movable  limiter  from  graphite  RGT-91  was  used. 
Central  plasma  parameters  were  remained  practically  at  the  same  level  but  the  intensity  of 
plasma wall interaction greatly increased.

Every  experimental  campaign  started  from  vacuum  vessel  (VV)  cleaning  by  heating  up  to 
200°С, inductive H2 or D2 discharges and He or Ar glow discharges. During experiments these 
procedures  of  VV  conditioning  were  used  every  night.  The  total  duration  of  VV  conditioning 
modes and plasma discharges are given in Table I.

The reflectance of mirrors before and after exposition and film thickness were measured by 
means  of  Lambda  35  (Perkin  Elmer)  spectro-photometer  and  with  TENCOR  Instruments 
profilometer,  correspondingly.  The  surface  morphology  and  microstructure  of  deposits  were 
investigated  with  JEOL  scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM)  and  by  X-ray  diffraction.  The 
Rutherford  Back  Scattering  (RBS)  in  combination  with  the  resonance  elastic  scattering  were 
used  for  analysis  of  deposits  composition.  RBS  analysis  was  carried  out  with  2  MeV  protons 
backscattered  from  the  sample  at  the  angle  of  170°.  Hydrogen  isotopes  depth’s  profiles  were 
measured with Elastic Recoil Detector Analyses (ERDA) by the He+-ion beam with the energy 
of 1.9 MeV.  

The deposited films have arisen on all samples after exposure in T-10 during both 2002 and 
2003  runs.  It  means  the  predominance  of  deposition  over  erosion  in  the  given  experimental 
conditions.  Results  of  2002  experimental  run  were  presented  in  [7,8].  The  surface  of  mirrors 

looked shining and smooth and the color of deposits varied from golden-crimson to violet-green. 
The screened parts of mirrors practically did not changed by sight, Fig. 6. The deposits not only 
decrease the reflectance of mirrors but also distort the spectrum of reflected radiation because of 
interference phenomenon.  
 

                       
        
Fig. 6. Photos of samples after finishing the 2002 year campaign. Lighter parts of mirrors were 
closed during whole exposure time. The deposit has quite homogenous, fine-dispersed structure.  
On mirrors protected by shutter during conditioning it grew with the rate 0.2 nm/s in 2002 and 4 
nm/s in 2003.  
 

 

Reflectance  of  mirrors  placed  edgewise  to  plasma  (8  and  9)  changed  only  slightly  and  no 

reflectance change was observed for mirror in position 7.  

The  deposits  have  a  quite  homogenous,  fine-dispersed  structure  with  inclusions  of  single 
spherical  particles  up  to  1-3  µm  in  size  and  flakes  having  dimensions  up  to  25  µm  [8].  Their 
origination can be explained by brittle erosion of the limiter under plasma disruptions. 

According  to  RBS  data  the  deposits  basically  consist  of  carbon,  hydrogen  isotopes  and  of 
about  5-8%  oxygen  impurity.  Deuterium  prevails  over  hydrogen  on  the  opened  parts  and  its 
concentration is practically constant inside the film, in the range 25-55 %.  

Hydrogen was found only in the near-surface layer down to the depth <80 nm. The thickness 
of deposits on screened parts of mirrors did not exceed 40-50 nm. Note that hydrogen, deuterium 
and carbon were uniformly distributed in the thin film (≈80 nm) on the mirror 9. Possibly this 
film  rose  predominantly  during  VV  conditioning  when  hydrogen  was  used,  similar  to  the 
deposits on screened parts of mirrors.  

The film thickness, the integral concentrations of deuterium and D/C ratio in deposits on the 

opened parts of mirrors are presented in Table II.

Note  that  D/C  ratio  was  equal  0.2-0.35  in  usual  operation  mode  in  2002  but  it  increased 
about  10  times  in  2003  probably  due  to  intensification  of  the  plasma-wall  interaction.  For  the 
mirrors  “protected”  during  VV  conditioning  the  deposition  rate  was  estimated  from  known 
duration of plasma discharges and the film thickness. The deposition rate was about 0.2 nm/s in 
2002 and 4 nm/s in 2003. Importantly that only thin films were found out on the mirrors placed 
edgewise  to  plasma  (8  and  9)  and  the  film  was  practically  absent  on  the  surface  of  mirror  7 
located in shadow of sample 5. It gives hope that in ITER conditions the secondary mirrors will 
not be covered with contaminating film.

The X-ray analysis showed two lines of CH-crystalline but no free carbon inside the deposits 
[8]. The 12 µm hydrocarbon film (sample 4, 2002) was transformed into a friable, black carbon 
based film in the course of annealing in vacuum step by step at fixed temperature within 10-20 
minutes.  Gas  began  to  desorb  at  450°C  and  finished  at  600°C.  During  vacuum  annealing  the 
molecules with different combinations of deuterium and hydrogen with carbon and oxygen were 
detected. So, it may be supposed that the deposits basically contain different CnDm compounds.  

Recently the ablation of the deposits was investigated under impact of pulsed excimer laser 
(λ=308 nm, F=10 Hz, τ=20 ns) in high vacuum conditions [8]. The laser beam was focused on a 
surface of mirror in a rectangular spot with size 6×2 mm2 at the energy density 0.05-0.15 J/cm2. 
The  total  removal  of  deposits  was  observed  after  approximately  30  laser  pulses  at  the  energy 
density higher than 0.12 J/cm2. When the energy density was a little less (about 0.1 J/cm2) the 
deposit was not removed and only the surface flaking was observed. The SEM analysis of laser 
track showed that deposits have a layered structure.  

2.1. Main results 

Deposition  prevails  over  erosion  for  the  mirrors  located  in  upper  limiter  port  of  T-10. 
Deposited films not only reduce the intensity of the reflected light, but also strongly change its 
spectra.  Deposition  rate  and  film  composition  depend  on  distance  and  orientation  of  mirrors 
relatively plasma. Results of 2003 campaign show that deposition rate and D/C ratio can be very 
high  in  particular  modes  of  tokamak  operation.  Mirrors  shaded  by  obstacles  from  the  plasma 
direct vision can be possibly protected from the fast growing of the deposit. 

 
3. Tore Supra 

Two  pairs  of  Mo,  SS  and  Cu  mirror  samples,  prepared  by  Kharkov  IPP  and  Kurchatov 
Institute, were installed in the vacuum vessel of the Tore Supra tokamak in February 2003. The 

molybdenum  samples  were  fabricated  from  a  single  crystal  (sc)  Mo(110)  with  divergence  of 
surface  orientation  ~30  minutes.  The  Mo  samples  were  mechanically  cut  from  the  rod  then 
mechanically  treated and finally polished in  a plant “Luch” in Podol’sk (Moscow region). The 
stainless steel samples were fabricated from a polycrystalline material. This steel was developed 
in  USSR  as  an  analogue  of  the  AISI  316  steel.  The  official  mark  of  this  steel  is 
04Cr16Ni11Mo3Ti,  which  means  ~0.04%  carbon,  16  %  Cr,  11%  Ni,  3%  Mo  and  some  small 
amount of Ti. The  base  is  iron.  The  polycrystalline copper samples  were  made of oxygen free 
copper  and  subjected  to  diamond  turning,  as  high  quality  mechanical  polishing  of  such  soft 
material seems to be difficult. 

The mirror samples of 22 mm diameter and 4 mm thickness have been installed on the high 
field side of the TS plasma vessel. They were located at theta = 7.5° and 15° out of the equatorial 
plane  (Fig.  7)  and  positioned  roughly  140  mm  from  the  LCFS.  The  reflecting  surface  of  all 
mirrors were oriented parallel (not inclined) to the toroidal field direction. The mirror assembly 
allowed  contact  cooling  via  the  first  wall  steel  panels.  2D-  thermohydraulic  finite  element 
calculations  of  the  mirror  sample  assembly  showed  temperatures  not  exceeding  ~150°C  for  a 
typical “Gigajoule” operation scenario (~1 MW radiated plasma power loss during 36 s of pulse 
length).

Supra vessel wall at high field side.  

 

3.1. Main result [9] 

Total and diffusive reflectance values were measured before and after exposure in the Tore 
Supra  tokamak  by  means  of  a  spectrophotometer  (λ=250-2500  nm)  and  significant  change  of 
reflectance  was  observed  for  all  samples,  but  especially  for  Cu,  as  Fig.  8  shows.  From 
measurements  by  con-focal  microscopy  the  surface  roughness  of  the  Cu  mirror  samples  after 
exposure  increased  by  factor  7  and  a  net  erosion  profile  depth  amounted  ~2.8  µm,  while  the 
surface  roughness  of  the  sc  Mo  samples  did  not  change  with  a  net  erosion  profile  depth  only 
~0.12 µm.

It was found that  all  exposed mirror samples  became not only  eroded but also coated  with 

some deposited layers what is the main reason for change of the total reflectance.  

Independent  measurements  at  IR  wavelength  (118.6µm)  showed  insignificant  variation  for 

 

all mirror samples.  

Ex-vessel  glow discharge  experiments in progress on virgin  mirror samples show  that long 

lasting conditioning procedures can contribute to additional important material erosion. 
 
4. TEXTOR  

Polycrystalline mirrors from molybdenum were placed in the SOL plasma of TEXTOR [10]. 
The  photograph  in  Fig.  9  shows  the  experimental  set-up  and  the  appearance  of  mirrors  after 
exposure.  One  large  mirror  (115mm  x  74mm)  was  fixed  inclined  at  20° to  the  toroidal  fluxes. 
The  mirror  was  partly  protected  by  an  aluminium  bar  which  created  a  shadow.  Outside  the 
shadow  some  deposition  becomes  visible.  One  small  mirror  was  placed  for  comparison  at  the 
rear  side  of  the  holder  perpendicular  to  the  toroidal  direction.  All  mirrors  were  polished 
mechanically and had optically been pre-characterised.  

In the first experiment the edge of the mirror closest to the plasma was kept at a distance of 8 
mm from the LCFS (plasma radius 46 cm) which is an erosion dominated zone in TEXTOR. It 
was exposed to 30 neutral beam heated (increasing from zero up to 1.3 MW) plasma pulses (line 
averaged density ne =1.5x1019 m-3) with a total exposure time of 197 s. These conditions caused 
strong temperature rises (>1000°C for ≈3s) of the edge of the small mirror. The temperature of 
the  large  mirror  measured  by  a  pyrometer  rose  to  400-750  °C  during  the  discharges.  For  the 
second experiment the closest edge of the mirrors to the plasma were placed at LCFS+25mm to 
cover primarily the deposition dominated zone. They were exposed to 58 (partially neutral beam 
heated)  discharges  with  varying  plasma  density  (ne  =  1.5  to  4.5x1019  m-3)  and  a  total  exposure 
time  of  312  s.  The  bulk  temperature  achieved  150°C,  local  temperature  rises  have  not  been 
observed.  Carbon  deposition  up  to  thicknesses  of  more  than  200  nm  took  place  except  in 

shadowed regions and at the edges. After dismounting the surface the deposits were investigated 
by ion-beam analyses.

In the first experiment the edge of the mirror closest to the plasma was kept at a distance of 8 
mm from the LCFS (plasma radius 46 cm) which is an erosion dominated zone in TEXTOR. It 
was exposed to 30 neutral beam heated (increasing from zero up to 1.3 MW) plasma pulses (line 
averaged density ne =1.5x1019 m-3) with a total exposure time of 197 s. These conditions caused 
strong temperature rises (>1000°C for ≈3s) of the edge of the small mirror. The temperature of 
the  large  mirror  measured  by  a  pyrometer  rose  to  400-750  °C  during  the  discharges.  For  the 
second experiment the closest edge of the mirrors to the plasma were placed at LCFS+25mm to 
cover primarily the deposition dominated zone. They were exposed to 58 (partially neutral beam 
heated)  discharges  with  varying  plasma  density  (ne  =  1.5  to  4.5x1019  m-3)  and  a  total  exposure 
time  of  312  s.  The  bulk  temperature  achieved  150°C,  local  temperature  rises  have  not  been 
observed.  Carbon  deposition  up  to  thicknesses  of  more  than  200  nm  took  place  except  in 
shadowed regions and at the edges. After dismounting the surface the deposits were investigated 
by ion-beam analyses. 

The  set-up  of  a  periscope-like  system  on  TEXTOR  simulates  the  ITER  diagnostic  ports 
transmitting the plasma radiation to further distant sensors. Two plane mirrors were installed in 
tubes facing each other at a distance of 275 mm. The mirrors are oriented 45° with respect to the 
line of sight. The orifice (35 mm diameter) is oriented perpendicular to the toroidal direction.

The second end was closed with a polished end plate as is shown in Fig. 10. The SOL fluxes 
hit  the  first  mirror  under  45°.  Carbon  transport  inside  and  deposition  can  be  investigated  after 
dismounting of the system. The deposition patterns on exchangeable steel foils wrapped inside 
the tubes complete this information. The stainless steel body can be heated up to about 500°C. 
Mirrors made from TZM (99% Mo, 0.1% Zr, 0.5% Ti) were used for the pilot experiment. The 
edge  closest  to  the  plasma  was  kept  at  25  mm  from  the  LCFS  and  the  system  exposed  to  89 
(partly  neutral  beam  heated)  plasma  pulses  (ne  =  1.5  to  4.5x1019  m-3)  with  a  total  plasma 
exposure time of 1047 s. The temperature was 150 °C.  

Total and diffuse reflectivities were measured under almost normal incidence (3° 20’) before 
and after exposure by means of a spectrophotometer (wavelength range λ=250-2500 nm) with a 
space resolution of ≈10 mm. Fig.11 shows examples for the wavelength dependence of the total 
reflectivity  Rtot  found  on  the  two  large  mirrors.  The  central  curves  (1)  represent  the  total 
reflectivity measured before and after plasma exposure at a location protected by the aluminum 
bar. The lines stay below the values given for polycrystalline molybdenum in literature [11]. As 
soon as deposition begins (curve 2 in Fig.11a) the reflectivity decreases by absorption in the film 
(thickness ≈30 nm). The drop is most pronounced in the UV region and levels off in the IR. In 
addition  to  absorption,  the  reflectivity  can  be  distorted  significantly  due  to  destructive  and 
constructive interference in thicker deposits. The example (curve 2, Fig. 11b) was measured on 
the mirror plate exposed deeper into the SOL (LCFS+25mm) where carbon deposition dominates 
and a film up to about 220 nm thickness was formed.  

                                                                      a) 

                                                                       
                                                                  b) 
Fig. 11. Total reflectivity Rtot  depending on wavelength measured on the molybdenum mirrors 
before and after exposure in a protected area (1) and after exposure in the deposition (2) and 
erosion (3) area. The mirrors (a) were exposed for 197 s in the erosion dominated zone (edge at 
LCFS+8mm) and (b) and for 312 s in the deposition dominated zone (edge at LCFS+25mm).   

 

Surprisingly,  an  increase  of  Rtot  was  measured  on  surface  areas  which  suffered  from  net 
erosion (curves 3). The increases are similar, independent whether the target mirror was exposed 
near  the  plasma  edge  (Fig.  11a)  or  deeper  into  the  SOL  (Fig.  11b).  This  increase  is  most 
pronounced  (∆Rtot  ≈10-20%)  for  short  wavelengths  and  almost  vanishes  (1-3%)  beyond  about 
1500 nm.  

The  local  dependence  of  the  reflectivity  was  measured  at  about  N=50  different  spots  by 
shifting the mirror plates in the two directions (x and y) parallel to the sides. Before exposure the 
reflectivity  scattered  a  little,  i.e.  the  differences  ∆R=  Ri(λ)-R(λ)av  between  one  local 
measurement (index i) and the average out of the N measurements was less than about ±3 % in 
the  visible  and  the  IR.  For  shorter  wavelengths  the  scatter  was  about  twice  as  much.  After 
exposure  the  local  changes  were  much  larger.  Fig.  12  shows  the  N  differences  ∆Rtot=  Rafter  - 
Rbefore measured on the mirror exposed at LCFS+8mm. The differences are highest for λ=250 nm 
(a) and achieve more than +12% (dark blue) in the eroded part of the mirror, while reductions of 
-30% (deep red) occur in areas covered with deposits. In protected or shadowed areas ∆Rtot is in 
the scatter range ∆R observed before exposure (blue green). For increasing wave lengths (b) the 
changes are less pronounced. The intensity of the diffuse reflected light has also been measured 
at the identical locations, but contributes little since the differences do not exceed about ±2% on 
this mirror plate.

Fig.  12.  Differences  ∆Rtot=  Rafter  -  Rbefore  given  in  colours  at  different  surface  locations  for 
λ=250nm  (a)  and  500nm  (b).  The  co-ordinates  x  and  y  cover  the  mirror  dimension  (74mm  x 
115mm). 
 
An increase of Rtot in the erosion dominated areas is expected, because the mirrors used in 
the experiments were not especially cleaned before installation in TEXTOR. The bombardment 
with plasma ions leads to a reduction of the surface impurity content and shifts the reflectivity up 
to  the  standard  values  given  in  literature  for  the  well  conditioned  surfaces  [9].  XPS-
measurements [12] on layers formed by Mo with increasing contents of C or O show decreasing 
reflectivity and lead to the same  conclusion.  The surface  erosion  which  is estimated to be less 
than 1µm [13] is mainly due to energetic deuterium and carbon ions. Part of the carbon remains 
intermixed  in  the  near  surface  layer  [14].  This  is  confirmed  by  SIMS  depth  profiling  in  the 
affected areas. But it has to be shown whether the presence of carbon in the interaction depth of 
≈5 nm can influence the reflectivity.  

The decrease of the total reflectivity in deposition dominated areas is due to absorption and 
by destructive interference if the deposit is thick enough. The example given (curve 3 in fig. 11b) 
roughly  fits  the  condition  i*λ/4  =  n*x  (i=1,  2,  3..)  for  destructive  or  constructive  interference 
using a film thickness of x=220 nm and a refractive constant n=1.65. The term n*x deviates by 
about +10% in the IR and by –10% in the UV region. This is likely due to the varying thickness 
within spot size of the measurement. But diffraction of light cannot be excluded. Combining the 
results from SIMS depth determination and the deuterium analysis with NRA yields a ratio D/C 
≈ 0.3. The optical constants (n=1.65, k=0.02 for λ=632nm) were measured in the deposition zone 
of the molybdenum mirror. For ITER, a deposition of carbon on optical components is difficult 

to predict quantitatively, but it is possible because of the chemical erosion and transport of the 
hydrocarbon radicals over long distances.                 

Mirror  #1  exposed  in  the  periscope  for  1047  s  showed  a  radial  decaying  deposit  with  a 
maximum  thickness  of  about  300  nm,  Fig.  13,  as  follows  from  electron  probe  micro-analysis 
(EPLM).  The  thickness  corresponds  to  a  deposition  rate  of  about  0.4 nm/s  (inclination  angle 
45°).. Although the  deposition  rate on mirror  1 is high, no detectable deposition was found on 
the following mirrors and walls.   

 

 

                             
 

 

Fig. 13. Distribution along the indicated line of the carbon-based film thickness deposited onto 
the mirror #1 of the periscope system. 

 
The deposition rate of ≈ 0.4 nm/s on mirror #1 (inclination angle 45°) in the periscope is less 
than found on the 20°  inclined  mirror (0.7 nm/s)  at  the  comparable  radial  position.  This  might 
partly  be  due  to  the  fact  that  roughly  one  half  of  the  carbon  entering  the  orifice  becomes 
deposited  on  the  inner  tube  wall,  visible  there  as  a  transparent  deposit.  Part  of  the  carbon  will 
likely be re-eroded from mirror #1. It is surprising therefore that no further deposition could be 
detected on the following walls and mirrors. One reason could be that the exposure time of 1047s 
is  too  short  to  grow  a  detectable  layer.  Another  reason  might  be  the  pressure  built  up  in  the 
closed system which prevents the hydrocarbon radicals to penetrate deeper. Enhanced re-erosion 
of freshly formed deposits [15] may also play a role.   

4.1. Main conclusions 

The  experiments  show  that  the  reflectivity  of  metal  mirrors  drastically  changes  after  the 
exposure  to  the  SOL  plasma  in  TEXTOR.  Increases  to  values  close  to  standard  values  are 
observed  in  erosion  dominated  areas,  as  well  as  decreases  of  the  reflectivity  due  to  carbon 
deposition. Both effects are a concern for the mirrors in the ITER diagnostic ports and periscopes 
and can occur side by side on a mirror. It is obvious that the decrease of the reflectivity is due to 
absorption and destructive interference in the deposit, but for the observed increase it seems that 
the  conditioning  of  the  surface  plays  an  important  role.  All  changes  of  the  reflectivity  are  the 
most pronounced in the near UV region, the IR region is almost not affected.  

No detectable amounts of carbon were found on surfaces inside the periscope system beyond 
mirror #1. This  behavior could be favorable for  ITER,  but  the  reasons for it remained unclear. 
These experiments are therefore a first step only to the understanding and developing of a model 
which can predict the ITER mirror performance.   
 
5. JT-60U 

In JT-60U, a tungsten plane mirror was installed near the divertor to measure impurity lines 

emitted in the divertor with a vacuum ultra violet (VUV) spectrometer.  

In  the  case  of  the  open  divertor  from  1991  to  1996,  mitigation  structure  such  as  baffles 
against  particle  deposition  on  the  surface  had  not  existed.  Hence  the  reflectivity  of  the  mirror 
was significantly reduced with contamination which was mainly made of hydrocarbon coating.  

After  the  modification  to  the  closed  divertor  (so  called  the  W-shaped  divertor)  in  1997,  a 
tungsten  plane  mirror  was  installed  to  view  the  divertor  plasma  as  shown  in  Fig.  14.  The 
tungsten mirror, which was fixed by a box type SS support, was electrically insulated from the 

vacuum  vessel  with  ceramics  plates  around  the  mirror  in  order  to  reduce  particle  deposition, 
particularly during the Glow Discharge Cleaning. No shutter is installed in front of the mirror. 
The  mirror  is  located  at  the  distance  of  240  mm  from  the  plasma.  A  molybdenum  rectangular 
tube (25 mm in outer width, 1.5 mm in thickness and 140 mm in length) is used to reduce the 
viewing solid angle to 0.01 str. The angle of the sight line is 72˚ to the separatrix and 82˚ to the 
magnetic field line.  The temperature of the mirror is around 300 °C since the vacuum vessel of 
JT-60U  is  300  °C  during  the  operation.  The  normal  pulse  length  of  JT-60U  is  about  15  sec. 
Under the condition, the reflectivity degradation of the mirror is not serious. VUV spectral lines 
can be observed with good S/N ratios after ~ 4000 shots of JT-60U.  

From  the  experience  of  the  tungsten  mirror  to  observe  the  divertor  plasma  in  JT-60U,  the 

followings are suggested.  

1) Something like baffles or long tube to minimize the viewing solid angle with matching the 
measurement should be used to avoid appearance of contamination (hydrocarbon coating). The 
use of the long tube is very effective to block off contaminants.  

2)  During  the  Glow  Discharge  Cleaning,  the  use  of  electric  insulators  from  the  vacuum 
vessel is strongly recommended to reduce introduce of Glow Plasma to the surface of the mirror. 
An electrical floating potential of the mirror by insulation seems to be better than the potential of 
the vacuum vessel to avoid contamination.

6. Conclusion 
1.  Deposition  of  contaminants  on  the  in-vessel  mirrors  is  probably  impossible  to  avoid.  The 
question is only in the rate of deposition or in the relation of deposition and sputtering rates.  
2.  Only  those  first  mirrors  maximally  open  to  the  hot  plasma  and  fixed  at  the  not  far  distance 
from the last closed magnetic surface can remain free from deposition of contaminating film due 
to possibility that the CXA sputtering rate predominates over the rate of film deposition (LHD, 
Tore Supra). However, the absence of contaminant layer on these mirror samples does not mean 

the  entire  lack  of  deposition:  in  reality  both  processes,  sputtering  and  deposition,  are  probably 
simultaneously taking place but with some predominance of sputtering.   
For such mirrors the guarantee of their long-term capacity for work is fabrication them from the 
single  crystalline  material.  However,  more  data  are  necessary  from  these  and  other  fusion 
devices, as in T-10 all plasma facing mirror samples became coated with C films. 
3. Secondary mirrors, shaded from the direct plasma view by obstacles, possibly can be protected 
from  the  growing  the  deposit  (T-10,  TEXTOR),  but  this  statement  must  be  checked  in 
experiments on other large scale fusion devices. 
4.  The  long  tube  minimizing  the  viewing  solid  angle  with  matching  the  measurement  can 
probably be used to avoid appearance (or decrease of the rate of appearance) of contamination 
(hydrocarbon coating).  
5. It is evident that the scale of experiments relating to investigations of environment effect on 
behavior of in-vessel mirrors in fusion devices under operation must be enlarged.  
 
7. Future experiment at JET 
7.1. Introduction 

The  environment  conditions  for  mirrors  in  divertor  region  of  ITER  will  be  very  different 
from those in the main chamber. The energy of the plasma particles will be <10 eV, i.e., below 
the threshold energy for physical sputtering of any material. Thus, for mirrors in divertor region 
(DFM)  the  sputtering  will  probably  not  play  any  significant  role.  Instead,  the  deposition  of 
eroded material will be the principal process.  If the carbon-based tiles are used in the divertor, 
the carbon will be the main impurity component in the divertor plasma. The carbon atoms will be 
in  different  state,  and  after  hitting  the  surface  they  will  combine  with  D-T  atoms  creating  the 
radicals  and  volatile  molecules,  which  can  move  freely  through  the  slits  into  the  region  where 
divertor mirrors have to be situated. The carbon layer thickness can increase with time leading to 
the  deterioration  of  mirror  reflectance  unless  an  effective  method  to  suppress  the  deposition  is 
developed. In addition, dust particles can be deposited on the DFM surface leading to a decrease 
of the reflectance and increase the scattering.  

To  clear  up  to  a  certain  extent  the  role  of  both  these  processes,  a  dedicated  experimental 
programme,  First  Mirror  Test  (FMT),  has  been  initiated  at  the  JET  tokamak  within  the 
framework Tritium Retention Studies (TRS).  

 

7.2. Scientific Rationale and the Experimental Programme at JET 

The choice of JET for doing the FMT is related to several unique features of this machine:  

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 

the largest divertor tokamak with an ITER relevant configuration,  
plasma pulses of 20 s,  
beryllium environment,  
comprehensive overview of erosion and deposition in concurrent 

deposition monitoring activities within the TRS Project.  

The  program  aims  at  the  study  of  morphology  changes  occurring  on  surfaces  of  selected 
mirror  materials:  polycrystalline  molybdenum  and  stainless  steel.  The  inclusion  of  the  FMT 
project in the framework of the TRS project ensures a comprehensive insight into erosion and re-
deposition processes using a set of dedicated tools such as a quartz micro-balance (QMB) [16], 
indexable  collector  and  other  deposition  monitors.  Tested  mirror  samples  will  be  installed  in 
several places in the divertor and on the main chamber wall in the vicinity of these devices. 

 
7.3. Mirror Materials 
Following  contacts  with  the  ITER  Team  and  the  ITPA  Diagnostic  Expert  Group  two 

materials (out of 13 considered) were selected:  

(a) Polycrystalline molybdenum 
(b) Stainless steel 316L  

The idea of testing mirrors coated with thin evaporated films was eliminated, both due to the 
cost involved and potentially greater risk of damage to surfaces during the exposure. Secondly, 
the test with only two different materials was dictated by the limited space for mirror carriers in 
the divertor and on the main chamber wall. The choice of solid mirror materials was discussed 
and agreed with the diagnostics experts and the ITER Team.  

 

7.4. Design of Mirrors and Mirror Carriers 

Fig. 14 exemplifies a design of a stainless steel cassette with several channels in which the 
mirrors  are  mounted.  The  number  of  channels  in  a  cassette,  three  or  five,  is  dependent  on  the 
available space in various locations of the machine: three positions in the divertor (two cassettes 
in the inner, two in the outer two in the base) and two on the main chamber wall.  

The  cassettes  are  of  a  “pan-pipes”  shape  and  they  are  composed  of  two  detachable  plates. 
The  construction  enables  studies  of  deposition  both  inside  the  pan-pipes  channels  and  on  the 
mirror  surfaces.  Moreover,  the  exposure  of  mirror  surfaces  at  various  inclination  angles  and 
aspect ratio with respect to plasma is possible. Effects of sample temperature on deposition in the 
divertor  may  be  studied  by  comparison  with  the  QMB  data  [16].  Figures  15  a-c  show  the 
location of mirrors and other deposition monitors in the divertor base and the inner carrier. The 
arrangement  of  devices  in  the  outer  divertor  is  similar  to  that  in  the  inner  leg  (see  Fig.  15  d). 
There  are  also  cassettes  placed  on  the  main  chamber  wall  (Fig.  16)  protected  by  magnetic 
shutters  which  open  when  the  magnetic  field  is  on.  This  ensures  avoiding  the  deposition  of 
beryllium  during  its  evaporation  on  the  JET  wall.  Installation  of  all  the  deposition  monitoring 
devices in the JET vessel is compatible with remote handling [17]. The construction phase and 
commissioning of the diagnostic tools for TRS (including FMT) is to be ready for installation in 
2004. The experiment itself will be carried out in 2005 until the next opening of the JET vessel.

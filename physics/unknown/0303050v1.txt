A  general  model  for  the  ontogenetic  growth  of  living  organisms  has  been  recently

proposed.  Here  we  investigate  the  extension  of  this  model  to  the  growth  of  solid  malignant

tumors. A variety of  in vitro and  in vivo data are analyzed and compared with the prediction

of  a  'universal'  law,  relating  properly  rescaled  tumor  masses  and  tumor  growth  times.  The

results support the notion that tumor growth follows such a universal law. Several important

implications  of  this  finding  are  discussed,  including  its  relevance  for  tumor  metastasis  and

recurrence, cell turnover rates, angiogenesis and invasion.

A  better  understanding  of  the  growth  kinetics  of  malignant  tumors  is  of  paramount

importance for the development of more successful treatment strategies. Given the lack of clinical

data at non-symptomatic stages, it has been conjectured, that in most solid malignant human tumors

two  or  three  decades  elapse  between  the  first  carcinogenic  stimulus  and  the  clinical  emergence  of

the  neoplasm  (Tubiana,  1986).  Since  a  tumor  is  clinically  detectable  with  conventional  diagnostic
tools at approximately 1 cm3 in volume, representing a population of about 1 billion cells, some 30

cell doublings from the progenitory cancer cell must occur in order to reach this ‘diagnostic’ stage.

Assuming  typical  volume  doubling  times  of  about  100  days,  this  scenario  corresponds  to  a
preclinical  time  of  roughly  8  years  .  In  the  next  10  volume  doublings  up  to  about  103  cm3  in  size

(which  is  reportedly  lethal  in  primary  breast  cancer  by  Retsky,  1997),  the  clinical  history  of  the

tumor  passes  through  a  microscopic,  avascular  growth  phase,  followed  by  angiogenesis,  necessary

to sustain a macroscopic size (Folkman, 1971).Continuous tumor progression leads then eventually

to local tissue invasion and metastasis, depending on the particular cancer type.

A  recent  paper  from  West  et  al  (2001)  shows  that,  regardless  of  the  different  masses  and

development  times,  mammals,  birds,  fish  and  molluscs  all  share  a  common  growth  pattern.

Provided that masses and growth times for the different organisms are properly rescaled, the  same

universal exponential curve fits their ontogenetic growth data. The authors explain this phenomenon

with  basic  cellular  mechanisms  (West  et  al,  2002),  assuming  a  common  fractal  pattern  in  the

vascularization of the investigated taxa.

Since rapid volumetric growth and neovascularization are also hallmarks of solid malignant

tumors,  it  is  intriguing  to  investigate  whether  tumor  growth  follows  the  same  universal  curve.  For

this purpose we rescale tumor sizes and growth times according to West's recipe (West et al, 2001),
which we briefly recall here. Instead of the actual mass,  m, they use the ratio   r = (m/M)0.25 , where

M  is  the  asymptotic  mass  for  the  taxon;  r  relates  to  the  relative  proportion  of  total  energy

expenditure, which is required to ensure maintenance. Likewise, instead of the actual time,  t, these

authors use the rescaled dimensionless time

values of  a,  m0  and    M  are  reported  for  many  different  species  in  West  et  al  (2001).  Using  the

variables t and r , this 'universal' growth law follows:

In our case, m0 and M are the initial and final masses of the tumor, and  a is a parameter expected to

be  related  to  the  tumor’s  characteristics  (e.g.,  its  ability  to  metastasize  or  invade,  or  its  affinity  for

nutrients uptake). Since the definition of the parameters is non-trivial, a multistep fitting procedure

is adopted for their determination. From equations [1] and [2] we obtain:

r = 1 – exp (-t)

y = - a r0 t + y0    

where y = ln (1 – r) , y0 = ln (1 – r0). Available data normally provide  m as a function of  t during

the  tumor’s  growth  phase.  For  our  fitting  procedure,  the  lowest  and  largest  values  of  m  are  first
assumed for m0 and M, respectively, thus yielding a preliminary estimate for  y0  and a. Then m0 and

M  are  allowed  to  respectively  decrease  and  increase,  and  y0  and  a  reestimated  until  a  best-fit

(consistent with the available biological infomation) is obtained.

For  our  analysis,  we  have  used  available  data  from  the  literature,  spanning  in  vitro

experiments (multicellular tumor spheroids (Chignola et al, 2000, Nirmala et al, 2001) as well as  in

vivo data (both, from animal models (Steel, 1977; Cividalli et al, 2002) and patients(Norton, 1988;

Yorke et al, 1993). The results are presented in Figures 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and plotted against

equation [2]. The data fit the universal growth curve very well. Table 1 presents an estimate of the
relevant parameters  and, further  supporting  our claim, shows very high  R2  correlation  coefficients

between actual and fitted data.

growth also follows a universal law.

In  the  following,  we  will  briefly  discuss  possible  implications  of  our  conjecture  that  tumor

a)  tumor  metastasis  and  recurrence.  Some  forty  years  ago  Romsdahl  et  al.  (1961)  had

proposed  that,  upon  reaching  a  certain  “critical”  volume  of  the  primary  tumor,  metastatic

dissemination would start.  Tubiana  (1986)  evaluated  this  threshold  for  breast  cancer,  and  showed

that  it  critically  depends  on  the  axillary  lymph-node  involvement.  The  hypothesis  that  metastatic

behaviour  could  be  associated  with  a  universal  growing  phase  of  the  tumor  is  corroborated  by

experimental  evidence.  For  example,  data  from  C3Hf/Sed  mice  inoculated  with  fibrosarcoma

(FSall) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) (Ramsay et al, 1988) show that, if primary tumors

are treated upon reaching a diameter of 6 mm, the maximal percentage of metastasis is only 3.1% in

FSall  and  8.0%  in  SCCVII,  while  it  increases  to  14.3%  and  41.3%,  respectively,  if  the  treatment

starts  at  a  diameter  of  12  mm.  When  local  recurrence  of  the  same  tumor  lines  are  considered,  the

percentage  of  metastasis,  at  a  tumor  diameter  of  6  mm,  is  only  12.5%  in  FSall  and  43.0%  in

SCCVII, respectively, versus 46.6% and 70.3% at a diameter of 12 mm. Furthermore, the diameter

doubling time (± standard deviation) necessary to grow from 6 to 12 mm increases from  D tp=6.6 (±

0.4) days in primary to  D tr=13.6 (± 4.6) days in recurrent Fsall tumors, and from  D tp=7.7  (±  0.5)

days  to  D tr=12.8  (±  3.8)  days  in  SCCVII,  respectively.  An  approximate  computation  from  our

model yields  D tr / D tp  ~  1.7,  which  is  in  agreement  with  experimental  results  from  Ramsay  et  al

(1988).  Hence,  the  recurrent  cancer  grows  much  slower  than  the  primary  tumor.  Following  the

notion  of  a  universal  law,  a  possible  explanation  for  this  behavior  is  that  the  residual  clonogenic

cells  of  the  primary  tumor,  which  lead  to  recurrence,  generate  cells  belonging  to  an  ‘older’

developmental phase.

b) cell turnover rates. As another consequence of the model,  the relative amount of energy

devoted to tumor growth, R = 1 – r  can be related to the proportion  DN/N of the cells contributing

to the growth at any 'rescaled time', t :

=

R

exp( tt

)

 

N
N

Here,  N  is  the  total  number  of  tumor  cells  and  DN  is  the  difference  between  the  rates  of  newly

generated tumor cells (growth fraction (GF)) and tumor cells being lost (i.e., cell loss factor (CLF),

which includes both cell death and cell invasion). Eq. [4] predicts that  DN  is  larger  at  the  onset  of
tumor  growth,  and  decreases  exponentially  afterwards.  In  fact,  data  from  glioblastoma  spheroids

(Nirmala et al, 2001) suggest values for  DN/N  ranging  from  0.9  at  1  week  to  0.35  after  4  weeks.

Moreover,  knowing  the  rate  of  cell  turnover  at  any  developmental  stage  can  help  to  improve

therapeutic  strategies.  As  such,  we  may  define  the  'lethal'  dose  of  a  given  therapeutic  agent  as  the

dose D  for  which  the  rate  of  tumor  growth  post  treatment,  GF(D)  equals  the  rate  of  CLF.  GF(D)

depends  then  on  both  the  developmental  stage  of  the  tumor  (i.e.,  t)  and  on  its  therapeutical

response.  If  we  further  assume  a  given  survival  fraction  SF(D)  (different  for  each  tumor),  when  a

dose D  has  been  administered,  then  GF(D)  should  become  equal  to  the  GF  of  the  untreated  tumor

multiplied  by  SF(D).  There  is,  however,  a  threshold  time  (corresponding  to  the  “critical”  tumor

volume at inception of metastasis), before which the dose  D is  curative,  while  later  it  can  only  be

locally effective. A longitudinal study of the metastasis-free survival in prostate carcinoma (Fuks et

al, 1991) in 679 patients has shown that after 5, 10 and 15 years the percent survival of local control

(LC)  cases  was  90%,  82%  and  77%,  respectively,  while  for  local  failure  (LF)  cases  it  was  68%,

39%  and  24%,  respectively.  One  could  therefore  argue  that  the  LC  tumors  were  correctly  treated

(i.e., at doses larger than the lethal one) early on and that only in a small percentage of patients was

the  metastasis  threshold  already  surpassed  at  the  time  of  treatment.  Conversely,  LF  doses  were

inadequate and therefore, as the tumor mass continues to grow, metastases were inevitable.

c)  angiogenesis.    It  is  noteworthy  that  West  's  model  applies  to  organisms  growing  in

unrestricted  dietary  conditions.  Correspondingly,  only  fully  replenished  tumors  should  follow  the

universal  growth  curve.  And  in  fact,  as  Freyer  and  Sutherland  (1986)  pointed  out,  differences  in

growth rates and saturation sizes (of up to a factor of 500) were found comparing tumor spheroids

cultured  in  media  with  different  oxygen  and  glucose  concentrations.  As  such,  deviations  from  the

universal  curve  are  conceivable  depending  on  the  particular  environmental  conditions.  Our

formalism  may  yield  a  simple  mathematical  explanation  for  such  growth  behavior.  From  the

definition of r follows:

likewise, from the expression of M as a function of the metabolic rate in West et al  (2001) of a

Thus, if the average value of  Bc  decreases,  such  as  due  to  the  depletion  of  a  e.g.  non-replenished

nutrient concentration, the  r curve is bound to shift downwards. Therefore, as “ontogenetic” tumor

growth  should  depend  on  the  availability  of  nutrient  replenishment  or,  in  vivo,  on  the  successful

[5]

competitition  for  available  nutrients,  any  marked  deviation  between  the  universal  and  the  real

growth  curve  may  indicate  the  amount  of  additional  nutrients  necessary  to  satisfy  the  metabolic

demand of the growing tumor. Accordingly, one can further hypothesize that  in vivo the  degree  of

deviation  from  the  universal  curve  may  in  fact  relate  to  the  amount  of  paracrine  endothelial  cell

growth factors (e.g., VEGF (Plate et al, 1992; Shweiki et al, 1992) released by the nutrient-deprived

tumor  cells  in  order  to  induce  the  extent  of  neovascularization  necessary  to  provide  the  required

level of nutrient replenishment. It is noteworthy that the importance of nutrient availability has been

pointed  out  also  by  a  model  proposed  by  Delsanto  et  al.  (2000)  and  Scalerandi  et  al  (1999,  2001)

where,  following  the  Local  Interaction  Simulation  Approach  (LISA)  (Schechter  et  al,  1994),  a

consistent  set  of  rules  governing  the  microscopic  interactions  (at  the  cellular  level)  has  been

formulated,  amenable  to  direct  numerical  simulations  of  cancer  growth  both  in  the  avascular  and

vascular case.

d) Invasion. Finally, our findings also relate to  cell motility,  another  hallmark  of  malignant

tumors.  Extracellular  matrix-degrading  invasive  cells  are  likely  to  decrease  the  mechanical

confinement  around  the  tumor.  These  cells  also  appear  to  follow  specific  routes  of  dissemination,

which include the perivascular space in the case of malignant astrocytomas (Bernstein et al, 1989;

Vajkoczy et al, 1999). As such, at least in this case, tissue invasion should facilitate further growth

by reducing the constraint of confinement not only for the volumetrically expanding tumor itself but

also  for  the  aforementioned  chemo-attracted  endothelial  cells,  which  migrate  towards  the

angiogenic factor releasing tumor cells. Thus, a progressive decrease in  Bc  may  not  only  trigger an

increase in (e.g.) VEGF secretion, but could also induce an  increase  in the extent and dynamics of

tissue  invasion,  which  in  turn  facilitates  angiogenesis  and  ensures  continuing  tumor  growth.

Therefore,  not  only  metastasis  and  angiogenesis  but  also  tumor  cell  invasion  may  be  linked  to  a

“critical”  tumor  volume,  as  has  already  previously  been  argued  on  the  basis  of  experimental

findings from human glioma spheroids (Deisboeck et al, 2001).

In  summary,  we  have  investigated  the  applicability  of  West’s  general  model  for  the

ontogenetic  growth  of  living  organisms  to  the  case  of  solid  malignant  tumors.  The  results  from

fitting a variety of  in vitro  data  from  multicellular  tumor  spheroids  and  of  in  vivo  data  from  both

experimental  models  as  well  as  patients  support  the  notion  that  neoplasms  also  follow  a  universal

growth law. Our paradigm-shifting finding has far-reaching implications concerning the mechanism

of tumor metastasis and recurrence, cell turnover, angiogenesis and invasion.

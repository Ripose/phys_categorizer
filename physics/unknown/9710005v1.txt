Abstract

We study the projective linear group P GL2(A) associated with an ar-
bitrary algebra A, and its subgroups from the point of view of their action
on the space of involutions in A. This action formally resembles M¨obius
transformations known from complex geometry. By specifying A to be
an algebra of bounded operators in a Hilbert space H, we rediscover the
M¨obius group µev(M ) deﬁned by Connes and study its action on the space
of Fredholm modules over the algebra A. There is an induced action on
the K-homology of A, which turns out to be trivial. Moreover, this action
leads naturally to a simpler object, the polarized module underlying a
given Fredholm module, and we discuss this relation in detail. Any polar-
ized module can be lifted to a Fredholm module, and the set of diﬀerent
lifts forms a category, whose morphisms are given by generalized M¨obius
tranformations. We present an example of a polarized module canonically
associated with the diﬀerentiable structure of a smooth manifold V . Using
our lifting procedure we obtain a class of Fredholm modules characterizing
the conformal structures on V . Fredholm modules obtained in this way
are a special case of those constructed by Connes, Sullivan and Teleman.

Introduction

Much of the pioneering work of Connes in noncommutative geometry rests on
the notion of Fredholm module, which arises as an abstract formulation of the
calculus of elliptic operators on a diﬀerentiable manifold. It has been demon-
strated in numerous examples that Fredholm modules contain much of the ge-
ometric information associated with the underlying manifold. A key result in
this direction is the theorem of Connes, Sullivan and Teleman [6][7] which asso-
ciates an even Fredholm module with each oriented even dimensional conformal
manifold. Conversely, given such a Fredholm module, one can reconstruct the
original conformal structure [5, p.332]. It thus transpires that Fredholm mod-
ules are very close to being noncommutative analogues of conformal structures
on diﬀerentiable manifolds. This fact indicates that they play a more basic
role than spectral triples that capture the essence of the Riemannian geometry
of smooth manifolds. As is well known, conformal structure is fundamental in
general relativity, where it carries information about causality. Moreover, many
interesting non-compact conformal manifolds can be conformally compactiﬁed
(unlike the Riemannian case) which is a further indication that Fredholm mod-
ules will be useful in this context. They provide also a natural framework for
the study of pseudo-Riemannian structures in noncommutative geometry.

The point of departure for our work is a result of Connes, which introduces
a group of transformations of Fredholm modules. These transformations are
formally analogous to M¨obius transformations known from complex geometry.
In order to provide geometric background for them we deﬁne, for any algebra
A, the projective line P1(A) and the projective group P GL2(A). This group
contains several interesting subgroups that act in various ways on the set of
involutions in A. One of the most interesting cases in which this construction
may be considered is when A is an algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert
space and M is its commutant. In this case it is possible to give a complete
descriptions of subgroups of P GL2(A) that act on the space of self-adjoint invo-
lutions. Among those subgroups we discover the M¨obius group µev(M ) deﬁned
by Connes. We study the structure of this group in some detail. In particular,
we employ the Cayley transform to rederive the general formula for the polar
decomposition of M¨obius transformations. From this it follows easily that the
M¨obius group retracts onto the group of unitary elements in M . Since the same
result is true for any C∗-algebra A, we can combine this statement with our fur-
ther study of the action of the M¨obius group on the space of Fredholm modules
to prove that M¨obius transformations act trivially on the K-homology of the
algebra A.

After this basic set-up is ready, we turn to the question of the action of
the M¨obius group on the space of Fredholm modules. We ﬁrst study in detail
the structure of the space of unitarily equivalent Fredholm modules, proving a
‘localization theorem’. We then discuss the action of the M¨obius group. An
interesting feature of the action of this group on the space of Fredholm modules

2

is that it gives rise to a simpler object, the polarized module. Roughly speaking,
Fredholm modules contain information about confomal structure of a space,
whereas polarized modules encode its ‘diﬀerential’ structure. We study in detail
the relation between these objects and show in particular (building on the results
of [3]) that any Fredholm module has a canonical underlying polarized module.
Conversely, any polarized module may be lifted to a Fredholm module. This
lift is not unique, in general, and in fact we prove that all possible Fredholm
module lifts of a given polarized module may be conveniently grouped together
in a category, whose morphisms are generalized M¨obius transformations. The
most important example of a polarized module is one that can be canonically
associated with the diﬀerentiable structure of a smooth manifold V . Any lift of
this canonical polarized module to a Fredholm module depends on the choice of
a conformal structure on V . Any Frehdolm module obtained this way turns out
to be a special case of the Connes-Sullivan-Teleman Fredholm module associated
with a general conformal manifold of even dimension.

Another insight gained from the study of geometric examples is that Fred-
holm modules are normally constructed using algebras of complex-valued func-
tions acting in a complex Hilbert space. Thus if one is interested in real mani-
folds and algebras real-valued functions, it seems that part of the data is lost in
the process. This suggests that there should be a property of Fredholm modules
that would describe this real structure. Hence we introduce the notion of real
Fredholm modules and real polarized modules and show that the action of the
M¨obius group preserves this notion. The canonical polarized modules and its
lifts to a Fredholm module are real in this sense.

1 The group of M¨obius transformations

1.1 The projective line P1(A) and the projective group P GL2(A)

In this section, we set up the algebraic background for discussion of projective
lines and projective groups associated with an algebra A. The following section
will bring topological considerations, where we shall assume that the algebra A
is a Banach or a C∗-algebra.

Let A be a complex unital algebra. We denote by GL1(A) the group of
invertible elements in A. Let us introduce the following equivalence relation on
the space A × A − {(0, 0)}. We say that (a1, b1) ∼ (a2, b2), for ai, bi ∈ A iﬀ there
exists λ ∈ GL1(A) such that

a1 = a2λ,

b1 = b2λ

1.1 Definition. The quotient space (A × A − {(0, 0)})/ ∼, denoted P1(A),
will be called the projective line over A .

3

1.2 Remark.
If the algebra A is not commutative, then there are two ways
to deﬁne the projective line, corresponding to the left and right actions of the
group GL1(A) on A × A.

1.3 Definition. The ﬁnite part, or set of ﬁnite points of P1(A), consists of
the equivalence classes of pairs (a, b) in which b is invertible. This set will be
denoted P1(A)f .

1.4 Remark. A representative (a, b) of an equivalence class in P1(A)f is clearly
equivalent to the pair (ab−1, 1). This implies that there is a 1−1 correspondence
between elements of P1(A)f and A, given by [(a, b)] 7→ z = ab−1.

1.5 Remark.
In the case where A is the ﬁeld of complex numbers, the pro-
jective line is obtained from the set of ‘ﬁnite’ complex numbers by adding a
single ‘point at inﬁnity’. In the general case one may have many elements in the
algebra A that are non-zero, but nevertheless not invertible, so the projective
line is obtained there by adding not just a single point, but a set of ‘points at
inﬁnity’.

Let M2(A) be the algebra of 2×2 matrices with entries in A, and let GL2(A)
be the group of invertible elements of M2(A). Both M2(A) and GL2(A) act on
the left on the space A × A by the usual matrix multiplication. Since this left
action obviously commutes with the right diagonal action of the group GL1(A)
introduced earlier, the action of GL2(A) descends to the projective line P1(A).
The induced action of GL2(A) on P1(A) is not eﬀective, as is not diﬃcult to
see. Let Z(A) be the center of the algebra A, i.e, Z(A) = {a ∈ A | ab = ba, ∀b ∈
A}. It is clear that elements of GL2(A) of the form

(1.6)

a 0
0 a

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

with a ∈ Z(A) ∩ GL1(A) leave any point of the projective line P1(A) invariant.

1.7 Lemma. Let N be the subgroup of GL2(A) with the property that g(x) = x
for any g ∈ N and x ∈ P1(A). Then

N =

a 0
0 a

(cid:26)(cid:18)

(cid:19)

| a ∈ Z(A) ∩ GL1(A)

.

(cid:27)

Proof. Let T ∈ GL2(A) with matrix entries a, b, c, d, be such that for every
(x1, x2) ∈ A × A − {(0, 0)}, there exist a λ ∈ GL1(A) such that T (x1, x2) =
(x1λ, x2λ). Taking for (x1, x2) successively (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1) one obtains

4

b = 0, c = 0 and d = a. Next, take a pair (1, x), where x ∈ A is arbitrary. There
exists a λx ∈ GL1(A) such that T (1, x) = (λx, xλx), which gives immediately
λx = a and then ax = xa. So ax = xa for arbitrary x ∈ A. Finally, a diagonal
matrix T ∈ GL2(A) whose diagonal entries both equal a is invertible iﬀ a is
invertible.

Since it is clear that N is a normal subgroup of GL2(A), we can introduce

the following deﬁnition.

1.8 Definition. The projective linear group P GL2(A) is by deﬁnition the
quotient group

P GL2(A) = GL2(A)/N

It follows from the Lemma that the projective group P GL2(A) acts eﬀectively
on the projective line P1(A).

We shall now study various subgroups of P GL2(A). Our ﬁrst order of busi-
ness will be to identify elements from P GL2(A) which restrict, in some sense,
to transformations of the subset P1(A)f of ﬁnite points of the projective line.

Let then T ∈ P GL2(A) be represented by a matrix T =

entries in A. Since T acts on P1(A)f by

(cid:19)

This happens when cz +d is invertible for any z ∈ P1(A)f . As this assumption is
quite restrictive, we shall ﬁrst investigate possible action of M¨obius transforma-
tions on the subset of involutions in P1(A)f , i.e., elements f such that f 2 = 1.
We begin with the simplest possible case.

1.9 Lemma. Let T ∈ P GL2(A) be as above. Then the action of T on the two
trivial involutions in A, f+ = +1 and f− = −1 is well deﬁned if and only if
c + d and c − d are invertible. Furthermore, T f± = f± if and only if c = b and
d = a.

Proof. The ﬁrst part of the lemma follows immediately from the application

of the formula

z 7→ (az + b)(cz + d)−1

for the action of T on P f
representative in the equivalence class of T is obvious.

For the second part, applying the above formula one gets a + b = c + d
and −a + b = c − d. Addition and subtraction then gives c = b and d = a.
Independence of choice of representative is again obvious.

1.10 Remark. As projective transformations are not linear in general, the
conditions for the action of T on f± are independent.

Let us denote by G the set of matrices

∈ GL2(A) in which a + b

a b
b a

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

and a − b are invertible.

1.11 Proposition. G is a subgroup of GL2(A), and its image G under the
canonical surjection GL2(A) → P GL2(A) is a subgroup of the projective linear
group P GL2(A).

Proof. The identity matrix clearly is an element of G, and a simple calculation
shows that a product of two matrices from G is again a matrix in G. An element
T ∈ G is by deﬁnition an element of GL2(A) and therefore has an inverse T −1
in GL2(A). It is clear that T −1 is deﬁned on the two trivial involutions f± and
leaves them invariant, so T −1 is also in G, because of Lemma 1.9. Moreover, the
kernel of the canonical homomorphism of GL2(A) onto P GL2(A) is a normal
subgroup of G. Therefore the quotient group of G can be identiﬁed with a
subgroup G of the group P GL2(A).

1.12 Proposition. The group G is isomorphic to the direct product group
GL1(A) × GL1(A) ⊂ GL2(A). The subgroup G of the projective linear group
P GL2(A) is isomorphic to (GL1(A) × GL1(A))/N .

Proof. Deﬁne x and y in A as

with the inverse relations

x = a + b
y = a − b

a = 1
b = 1

2 (x + y)

2 (x − y)

The invertibility of a + b and a − b is equivalent to the invertibility of x and y.
Matrix multiplication expressed in these coordinates becomes (x1, y1)(x2, y2) =
(x1x2, y1y2), where xi, yi ∈ GL1(A), which means that the group G is isomorphic
to the direct product group GL1(A) × GL1(A). Although not necessary here,
we mention that using this parametrisation it is also easy to ﬁnd the inverse of
a matrix in G. Since the inverse of (x, y) is (x−1, y−1) we get that

To prove the statement about the subgroup G of P GL2(A), it is suﬃcient to
note that N is a normal subgroup of GL1(A) × GL1(A).

We ﬁnish this discussion by recording one more simple fact.

1.14 Proposition. Let T ∈ G. Assume that T is represented by a matrix

T =

. If, for some involution f ∈ A, bf + a is invertible, then the

a b
b a

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

image of f under T is an involution.

Proof. We use the formula f 7→ (af + b)(bf + a)−1, which is independent of the
choice of representative of T in GL2(A). Because f −1 = f , this can be written
as f 7→ (af + b)((b + af −1)f )−1 = (af + b)f (af + b)−1, which immediately gives
[(af + b)(bf + a)−1]2 = 1.

Let us now be a bit more daring and consider projective transformations T
that are deﬁned on all involutions f ∈ A. We start with the subgroup GC of

GL2(A) consisting of matrices

a b
b a
involution f in A. We shall denote by GC the image of GC in P GL2(A).

such that bf + a is invertible for any

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

1.15 Proposition. GC is a subgroup of GL2(A), and GC is a subgroup of
P GL2(A) acting eﬀectively on the set of all involutions in A.

Proof. Let Ti ∈ GC be given by matrices

, i = 1, 2. We need to prove

that the product T2T1 is an element of GC, i.e., that bf + a is invertible for all
involutions f , where

ai
bi

bi
ai

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

a = a2a1 + b2b1,

b = a2b1 + b2a1.

Let f be an involution in A and let f1 = (a1f + b1)(b1f + a1)−1. Then it is easy
to check that

bf + a = (b2f1 + a2)(b1f + a1)

hence it is invertible as the product of two invertible elements. Finally, it is
clear that N is a normal subgroup of GC, and so the second statement follows.

To summarize, we have identiﬁed subgroups of GL2(A) and P GL2(A) that

ﬁt into the following commutative diagram

(1.16)

N −→ GC −→ G −→ GL2(A)

in which the horizontal arrows are inclusions and vertical arrows are surjections.
The group G acts eﬀectively on the projective line P1(A), leaving the two trivial
involutions f± ﬁxed, whereas the subgroup GC acts on the set of all involutions
in A.

Let us now assume that the algebra A is Z2-graded. This grading is inherited
by the matrix algebra M2(A), and in particular even matrices in M2(A) are those
whose diagonal entries are even and oﬀ-diagonal entries are odd elements of A.
Using this additional structure we can single out a new subgroup of G, namely

Gev = G ∩ M ev

2 (A). This group consists of all even matrices

a b
b a

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

in which

a + b and a − b are invertible. These matrices preserve the trivial involutions
±1. Similarly, we have the subgroup Gev
It is straightfor-
ward to check that elements of the group Gev
C map odd involutions in A to odd
involutions.

C = GC ∩ M ev

2 (A).

As before, the action of the groups Gev and Gev

C is not eﬀective, as the ele-
ments of N ev = Z(A) ∩ GL1(A) ∩ M ev
2 (A) act as identity transformations on in-
volutions. The canonical surjection GL2(A) → P GL2(A) restricts to GL2(A)ev
and the kernel of this restriction is N ev thus giving a new group P GLev
2 (A).
Note that we do not mean to imply here that P GL2(A) is a graded group. N ev
is a normal subgroup of both Gev and Gev
C and
Gev of P GLev
C acts eﬀectively on the set of involutions, sending odd
involutions to odd involutions. These new groups form a commutative diagram
identical to 1.16.

C . Thus we get two subgroups Gev

2 (A). Gev

1.2 The projective group and ∗-algebras

From this point onwards we shall assume that A is a ∗-algebra (which will
become a Banach or a C∗-algebra later on), so that one can speak of selfadjoint
In the presence of this additional structure, our
and unitary elements of A.
initial observations concerning the groups G, GC, G and GC can be sharpened.
In particular, we set out to investigate under what additional conditions the
groups GC and GC will act on the set of self-adjoint involutions in A.

Let us begin with the subgroup GC of matrices

such that bf + a is

invertible for all involutions f in A. We are looking for conditions on a, b that
would ensure that the involution f ′ = (af + b)(bf + a)−1 is self-adjoint, for any
self-adjoint involution f .
1.17 Lemma. The image f ′ = (af + b)(bf + a)−1 of a self-adjoint involution f
is self-adjoint if and only if the following identities hold.

a b
b a

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(1.18)

[a∗a − b∗b, f ] = 0
[a∗b − b∗a, f ] = 0
[aa∗ − bb∗, f ] = 0
[ab∗ − ba∗, f ] = 0

8

Proof. We have already seen that f ′ is an involution. It will be self-adjoint iﬀ
((af + b)(bf + a)−1)∗ = (af + b)(bf + a)−1

which is equivalent to

(f a∗ + b∗)(bf + a) = (a∗ + f b∗)(af + b).

We rewrite the last formula as

f (a∗b − b∗a)f − [f, a∗a − b∗b] − (a∗b − b∗a) = 0

and note that, since it is expected to hold for all self-adjoint involutions f it
must, in particular, hold for −f . Proceeding in the same way with −f in place
of f produces a similar condition, and the two together yield

[a∗a − b∗b, f ] = 0
[a∗b − b∗a, f ] = 0

To derive the latter two, we use variables x = a + b and y = a − b to rewrite the
last two formulae in the following form

[x∗y + y∗x, f ] = 0
[x∗y − y∗x, f ] = 0
which leads to a single condition [x∗y, f ] = 0. The inverse transformation to f 7→
f ′, which depends on x−1 and y−1, leads to a similar condition [(x∗)−1y−1, f ] =
0 which is equivalent to

This in turn gives

This ﬁnishes the proof of the lemma.

[xy∗, f ] = 0.

[aa∗ − bb∗, f ] = 0
[ab∗ − ba∗, f ] = 0.

1.19 Remark.
It is clear that the identities 1.18 still hold if a and b are
replaced by au = ua, bu = ub, with u ∈ Z(A) ∩ GL1(A), and so they descend
to the group GC ⊂ P GL2(A).

In the case when A is the C∗-algebra L of bounded operators in a Hilbert
space H we can say a bit more. Since to any self-adjoint involution f corresponds
a self-adjoint projection e = (1 + f )/2, the formulae 1.18 imply that the same
identities should hold for an arbitrary self-adjoint projection. Thus the operators
on the left in 1.18 have to be multiples of the identity operator on H. We thus
have that

(1.20)

a∗a − b∗b = λ1
a∗b − b∗a = iλ2
aa∗ − bb∗ = λ3
ab∗ − ba∗ = iλ4

9

where λi are real numbers. Rewriting these formulae in terms of x and y we
ﬁnd

or, if we use that x and y are invertible,

x∗y = λ1 − iλ2
xy∗ = λ3 − iλ4,

x = (λ3 + iλ4)(y∗)−1
y = (λ1 − iλ2)−1(x∗)−1

This gives that λ1 = λ3 and λ2 = −λ4 with λ1 and λ2 not both equal zero.

Our calculations thus demonstrate that elements of the group GC may be
written in the x, y variables as (x, α(x∗)−1), where x is an arbitrary invertible
element of A and α = λ1 − iλ2 is an arbitrary complex number. Any such pair
can be written as

(x, α(x∗)−1) = (1, α)(x, (x∗)−1) = (x, (x∗)−1)(1, α).

This leads to the following statement.

1.21 Theorem. Let A be the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space
H. Then the group GC is the direct product GC = GL1(A) × C× of the group of
invertible elements in A and the multiplicative group of complex numbers. The
image GC of this group in P GL2(A) is the group P GL1(A) = GL1(A)/C×.

Proof. The ﬁrst part of the theorem has already been proved. The statement
about the group GC follows from the fact that, if A is the algebra of bounded
operators on a Hilbert space, then by Schur’s lemma its centre is just the ﬁeld
of complex numbers, so that Z(A) ∩ GL1(A) = C×, in this case.

Keeping our assumption that A is the algebra of bounded linear operators
on a Hilbert space we note that the group GC contains an interesting subgroup,
which is isomorphic to GL1(A) and which consists of elements (x, (x∗)−1), x ∈
A. This corresponds to the choice of λ1 = λ3 = 1 and λ2 = −λ4 = 0. This
is precisely the group µ(A) deﬁned by Connes [5, p. 335], which consists of

matrices

and which follows directly from our computations. Moreover, as these identities
imply that (a + b)−1 = a∗ − b∗ and (a − b)−1 = a∗ + b∗, it is clear that condition
1.22 is a special case of the formula 1.13. Hence our results put Connes’ con-
struction in an interesting geometric context. The group µ(A) will be our main
object of study, with the algebra A to be speciﬁed.

Finally, let us assume that A is a Z2-graded algebra with grading given by
conjugation by a ﬁxed involution γ. Following the procedure outlined here we
uncover the group µev(A) which is deﬁned in the same way as µ(A) with the
additional requirement that a be even and b be odd in A.

1.24 Proposition. µev(A) is isomorphic to the subgroup of GL1(A) consisting
of elements x such that γx∗γ = x−1.

Proof. [3] Deﬁne a map µev(A) → GL1(A) by

with a even and b odd. The identities 1.23 give in this case that

1.3 The M¨obius group over a C∗-algebra

The general algebraic formalism developed in previous section becomes par-
ticularly useful when the algebra over which the M¨obius group is deﬁned is a
C∗-algebra. We shall now look into possible reﬁnements of the algebraic theory
under this additional assumptions. There will be two special cases that roughly
determine the scope of interesting choices of an algebra. One is the essential
commutant of the representation π, and the other is the commutant of π. The
ﬁrst case is of interest from the point of view of K-homology, whereas the second
is better suited to geometric applications. One of the tools that we shall use in
further study of the M¨obius group is the Cayley transform, and so we begin by
recalling its basic properties.

1.25 Proposition. Let H be a (complex) Hilbert space. There is a 1 − 1 cor-
respondence between bounded invertible positive operators Q, and bounded self-
adjoint operators m with norm strictly smaller than one. This correspondence
is given by the formula

with the inverse relation

The operator Q is called the Cayley transform of m.

Q =

m =

1 − m
1 + m

,

1 − Q
1 + Q

.

11

It is not diﬃcult to see that the Cayley transform of Q−1 is −m. Note also

that the fractional notation in the above formulae is justiﬁed, because

(1 − m)(1 + m) = (1 + m)(1 − m)

implies

(1 + m)−1(1 − m) = (1 − m)(1 + m)−1.

Finally, we observe that Q and m commute.

Let A be a C∗-algebra of operators in a complex Hilbert space H. In this case
the group µ(A), deﬁned in the previous section, will be called the M¨obius group.
In the graded case we shall consider the even group µev(A). The isomorphism
that identiﬁes µ(A) with GL1(A), or a subgroup of GL1(A) in the graded case,
allows one to deﬁne unitary and positive elements on µ(A), and to introduce
polar decomposition of elements on the M¨obius group. And so, an element

of the M¨obius group is unitary if and only if the corresponding

g =

a b
b a

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

element x = a + b is unitary in GL1(A). Such a g is said to be positive if and
only if x is positive in GL1(A).

1.26 Proposition. An element g ∈ µ(A) is unitary if and only if it has the
form

g =

(cid:18)

u 0

(cid:19)

with u a unitary operator in A.

Such an element g is positive if and only if it has the form

with m a bounded, selfadjoint operator in A which has norm strictly smaller
than one.

Proof. The ﬁrst part of the proposition is clear. For the second, let us denote the
image of g in GL1(A) by x. We assume that x is positive. We use the Cayley
transform 1.25 to deﬁne a selfadjoint operator m, which has norm strictly smaller
than 1, by the formula

Continuous functional calculus on A shows that m is an element of A. Moreover,
since x is positive,

m =

There is an alternative parametrization of the positive elements of the M¨obius

group µ(A).

g =

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

for a selfadjoint operator ω in A. This ω is uniquely determined by g.

Proof. Let a positive element x of GL1(A) be the image of g ∈ µ(A). For a
positive x ∈ GL1(A) there exists a unique bounded self-adjoint element ω such
a b

(cid:18)

An arbitrary bounded invertible operator A in a complex Hilbert space H

admits two polar decompositions, i.e., it can be written either as A = UL(A∗A)

or as A = (AA∗)

are of course unique. Through the isomorphism between GL1(A) and µ(A) an
arbitrary element g of µ(A) has a corresponding pair of what may also be called
polar decompositions.

This result was ﬁrst proved by Connes [5, Prop. 5, p. 335].
Let us denote by U the group of unitary elements in GL1(A).

1.30 Proposition. The unitary group U is a deformation retract of the group
µ(A).

path of elements gm,t linking gm to the identity matrix.

1.31 Remark.
In what follows, we shall be mostly interested in the case
where A is identiﬁed with a ∗-subalgebra of the algebra of bounded operators
on a Hilbert space by means of a faithful representation π. The M¨obius group
of interest in that case will be constructed in the same way as above with the
assumption that the algebra A is the commutant M of the representation π.
Our results will still apply in this case. The group µ(M ) (or µev(M ) in the
graded case) is the same as the group introduced by Connes in [5, p.334]. It
would be natural to call this group the Connes-M¨obius group, but for reasons
of simplicity we shall use the name M¨obius group.

2 M¨obius transformations of Fredholm modules

2.1 Fredholm modules

Probably the most interesting feature of the M¨obius group is the fact that
it acts on the space of Fredholm modules. This action, as we shall see later, has
interesting geometric consequences. But ﬁrst, let us quickly review the standard
notions.

14

2.1 Definition. Let A be an involutive algebra over C. An even Fredholm
module over A is given by the data (H, π, γ, F ). Here H is a Z2-graded Hilbert
space with the grading given by a self-adjoint involution γ; π is a faithful ∗-
representation π of A in H commuting with γ, and F is a self-adjoint involution
on H which anticommutes with γ. Moreover, we assume that for any a ∈ A,
[F, π(a)] is a compact operator.

An odd Fredholm module is deﬁned in an analogous way but without the

assumption that the space H is Z2-graded.

2.2 Remark. The presence of a self-adjoint involution F anticommuting with
γ guarantees that the eigenspaces H0 and H1 are isomorphic. Conversely, any
unitary operator T : H0 → H1 gives rise to a self-adjoint involution F given by
the formula

F =

0 T ∗
0
T

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

Using this idea it is not diﬃcult to show that the space of all s.a. involutions F
anticommuting with γ is diﬀeomorphic to the group U (H0) of unitary operators
on H0.

2.3 Definition. Two Fredholm modules αj = (Hj, πj, Fj, γj), j = 1, 2, are
called unitarily equivalent if and only if there exists a unitary map U : H1 → H2
such that

F2 = U F1U −1,

γ2 = U γ1U −1,

and

U π1(a)U −1 = π2(a), ∀a ∈ A.

which will be written as U π1U −1 = π2.

In such a case we shall write α2 = U α1U −1.

One can also deﬁne a more general notion of isomorphism of Fredholm mod-

ules, but we shall not need it here.

It is not diﬃcult to understand the structure of the space of unitarily equiv-
alent Fredholm modules. Let us denote by FM the class of all odd Fredholm
modules α = (H, π, F ). In the even case we shall use the symbol FMev to denote
the class of all even Fredholm modules α = (H, π, γ, F ).

Two Fredholm modules α and α′ can only be unitarily equivalent if the
representations π and π′ belong to the same unitary conjugacy class. Thus we
have the following disjoint union decomposition

FM =

FMp

p
[
where p runs through the space of equivalence classes of representations π and
FMp is the set of all Fredholm modules (H, π, F ) in which π ∈ p. If we denote

15

the relation of unitary equivalence of Fredholm modules by ∼ then we have the
following simple observation:

(2.4)

FM/ ∼ =

(FMp/ ∼)

p
[
In the even case we have in the same way

FMev/ ∼ =

FMev

p / ∼

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

p
[
Since we only consider separable Hilbert spaces, we can describe the set of
equivalence classes FMp/ ∼ (FMev
p / ∼, respectively) in a simple way. Since the
reasoning is the same in the even and odd cases, we shall concentrate on the
odd case. Let us ﬁx a Hilbert space Hp equipped with a representation πp ∈ p.
We deﬁne FMπp ⊂ FMp to be the set of Fredholm modules α = (Hp, πp, F ),
where now only F is variable. We remark that if π, ρ ∈ p then FMπp ≃ FMρp.
Let us for the moment denote by ∼p the restriction of the equivalence rela-
tion ∼ to the set FMπp. It follows directly from the deﬁnition that a unitary
equivalence of two Fredholm modules from FMπp is established by means of a
unitary operator U from the commutant of the ﬁxed representation πp.

For each α = (Hα, πα, Fα) ∈ FMp one can ﬁnd a Fredholm module β ∈ FMπp
such that α ∼ β. Indeed, as πα and πp are unitarily equivalent representations,
there exists a unitary isomorphism U : Hα → Hπp such that πp = U παU −1.
Deﬁne β = (Hp, πp, U FαU −1). It is clear that β ∈ FMπp and α ∼ β. Hence,
using general properties of equivalence relations, we conclude that there exists
a bijection between the sets of equivalence classes FMp/ ∼ and FMπp/ ∼p.

Repeating this construction in the even case we arrive at the following ‘lo-

calization’ result.

2.5 Theorem. There are the following bijections of sets:

(FM/ ∼) ≃

(FMπp/ ∼p)

(FMev/ ∼) ≃

(FMev

πp/ ∼p)

where p runs through the set of conjugacy classes of representations of A in H
and πp is a ﬁxed representative of a given class p.

In other words, if we want to ﬁnd all Fredholm modules unitarily equiva-
lent to a given α = (H, π, γ, F ), it is suﬃcient to consider, without losing any
information, the Fredholm modules that can be obtained by acting on α with
unitary operators that belong to the commutant of π.

We pass to the discussion of the action of the M¨obius group on the space of
Fredholm modules. This action was ﬁrst introduced by Connes, and is deﬁned

as follows. If α = (H, π, F, γ) is an even Fredholm module and g =
,
(cid:19)
where a, b ∈ M = (π(A))′
is an element of the M¨obius group µ(M ), then
gα = (H, F ′, γ) where F ′ = (aF + b)(bf − a)−1. As Connes shows, the M¨obius
group maps p-summable Fredholm modules to p-summable Fredholm modules
of the same parity. There is an interesting generalization of this statement.

(cid:18)

For any two bounded operators P, Q on H we write P ∼ Q if P and Q diﬀer

a b
b a

by a compact operator.

2.6 Definition. The essential commutant of a representation π in L is

Dπ(A) = {x ∈ L | ∀a ∈ A,

[π(a), x] ∼ 0}

Dπ(A) is a C∗-subalgebra of the algebra L of bounded operators on H. It is
sometimes called the dual algebra of A, associated to the representation π. The
importance of the algebra Dπ(A) lies in its close relation to the K-homology
[10].

Let A be a C∗-algebra, let π be its representation in a separable Hilbert
space H, and let (A, F, H) be a Fredholm module over A. We shall denote by
D = Dπ(A) the essential commutant of π(A) in L. Associated with this data is
the M¨obius group µ(D). We have seen that µ(D) sends self-adjoint involutions
to self-adjoint involutions, and so in order to understand its action on the space
of Fredholm modules we need to understand its behaviour with respect to the
compactness condition. First we treat the case of a Fredholm module, where we
assume that the commutator [F, x] is a compact operator for any element x of
the algebra A.

2.7 Proposition. Let [F, x] be a compact operator for all x ∈ A. Then the
same is true for F ′ = g(F ), where g ∈ µ(D). In the case of an even Fredholm
module, this statement holds for any g ∈ µev(D).
Proof. We simply need to calculate the commutator [F ′, x] in terms of [F, x].
We have

[(aF + b)(bF + a)−1, x]

= [aF + b, x](bF + a)−1 + (aF + b)[(bF + a)−1, x]

The ﬁrst term in this sum may be written as

(2.8)

[aF + b, x](bF + a)−1 = (a[F, x] + [a, x]F + [b, x])(bF + a)−1

whereas the second takes the form
(aF + b)[(bF + a)−1, x]

(2.9)

= −(aF + b)(bF + a)−1(b[F, x] + [b, x]F + [a, x])(bF + a)−1

17

The ﬁrst terms of formulae 2.8 and 2.9 combine to give

a[F, x](bF + a)−1 − (aF + b)(bF + a)−1b[F, x](bF + a)−1

= ((bF + a)−1)∗[F, x](bF + a)−1

if we use that (a − F ′b)−1 = (bF + a)∗. The remaining terms all contain either
[a, x] or [b, x] and so their sum is a compact operator. To summarize, we have

(2.10)

[F ′, x] = ((bF + a)−1)∗[F, x](bF + a)−1 + K

where K is a compact operator.

2.11 Remark. Apart from the essential commutant Dπ(A), we can deﬁne a
p-summable commutant

Dp

π(A) = {x | ∀a ∈ A,

[x, π(a)] ∈ Lp(H)}

This is still a subalgebra of L, but it need not be a C∗-subalgebra, as the Schat-
ten ideals Lp are not norm-closed in L. This problem disappears if we restrict
our attention to the commutant M of π(A), which brings us back to the situa-
tion considered by Connes [5, p. 335]. In this case Lemma 2.7 can be improved:
The group µ(M ) maps p-summable Fredholm modules to p-summable Fredholm
modules, for any p ≤ 1. In the even case, the group µev(M ) acts in the same
way on even Fredholm modules.

2.2 M¨obius group and K-homology

The idea that gave rise to the notion of Fredholm module can be traced back
to the important paper [1] of Atiyah, where he describes an abstract approach
to the calculus of elliptic operators on a topological space in his search for a
theory that could be considered dual to the K-theory. This idea was developed
in papers by, among others, Baum, Connes, Douglas, Higson, Kasparov and led
to a deﬁnition of K-homology of a C∗-algebra A (cf. [2][10]).

The starting point is the space of all Fredholm modules over a C∗-algebra
A, represented in a ﬁxed Hilbert space H. On this space one deﬁned the notion
of equivalence using the already discussed unitary equivalence, triviality and
homotopy of Fredolm modules. Let us introduce the latter two concepts.

An even Fredholm module α = (H, π, F, γ) is trivial if and only if [π(a), F ] =

0 for all a ∈ A.

Two Fredholm modules α and β are said to be homotopic if there exists a
family (H, π, γ, Ft), where t ∈ [0, 1] and Ft varies norm-continuously in the space
of self-adjoint involutions anticommuting with γ. We keep the representation π
ﬁxed here. These deﬁnitions are modiﬁed in the obvious way to the case of odd
Fredholm modules.

18

Using the notions of unitary equivalence, triviality and homotopy equivalence
we deﬁne an equivalence relation on the space of Fredholm modules. The space
of equivalence classes of even Fredholm modules with respect to this relation
gives rise to the even K-homology group K 0(A). Similarly, the same idea applied
to the space of odd Fredholm modules produces the group K 1(A). Since the
M¨obius group acts on Fredholm modules, it is natural to ask about the behaviour
of this action from the point of view of K-homology.

It is clear that the M¨obius group maps trivial Fredholm modules to trivial

Fredholm modules. Moreover, we have the following result.

2.12 Proposition. The M¨obius group µ(A) (µev(A)) in the even case) acts on
the space of homotopy classes of Fredholm modules.

Proof. If Ft is a norm-continuous family of involutions between F0 and F1, then

g(Ft) = (aFt + b)(bFt + a)−1

is a norm-continuous path of self-adjoint involutions between g(F0) and g(F1).

2.13 Theorem. The M¨obius group µ(M ) acts trivially on the K-homology of
the algebra A.

Proof. Let α = (H, π, F ) be a Fredholm module and let g ∈ µ(M ), where M
is the commutant of the representation π(A). The M¨obius transformation g
maps α to the Fredholm module g(α) = (H, g(F ), π). Assume that the polar
decomposition of g is g = ugm. Then by Proposition 1.30, g(α) is homotopic
to the Fredholm module uαu∗, which belongs to the same K-homology class as
α. In the even case, an even M¨obius transformation g maps an even Fredholm
module β = (H, π, F, γ) to g(β) = (H, π, g(F ), g(γ)), which is homotopic to the
even Fredholm module

uβu∗ = (H, π, uF u∗, uγu∗) = (H, π, uF u∗, γ),

which belongs to the same K-homology class as β.

2.3 Polarized modules

To deﬁne a Fredholm module requires that we specify a Hilbert space H. In
many sitations, however, the Hilbert space structure is not really relevant, and
what really counts is just the underlying locally convex topological space. Of
course, we cannot hope that an arbitrary locally convex topological space could
be used to gain useful information about geometric objects. There is, however,

19

a category of spaces which are equipped with indeﬁnite inner products, whose
properties make them useful in geometric situations. These are Krein spaces.

Let us recall that a Hilbertian space H is a locally convex topological vector
space which is isomorphic to a Hilbert space. In other words, there exists an
inner product on H which induces the same topology.

2.14 Definition. A Krein space is a complex Hilbertian space H, provided
with a continuous hermitian form

σ : H × H → C

(x, y) = σ(x, γy),

and such that there exists at least one compatible Hilbert space inner product
(·, ·) on H given by

for all x and y in H, with γ an involution operator, selfadjoint with respect to
σ(·, ·).

One veriﬁes easily that the following three statements are equivalent:

1. (·, ·) is a hermitian form.

2. σ(γx, y) = σ(x, γy), ∀x, y ∈ H.

3. (γx, y) = (x, γy), ∀x, y ∈ H.

A compatible inner product is one that equipes the Hilbertian space H with
a Hilbert space structure whose topology, determined by the inner product, is
the same as the original locally convex topology of H. In what follows, we shall
frequently need to consider the same topological space either as a Krein space,
equipped with an indeﬁnite inner product σ(·, ·) or as a Hilbert space, with a
Hilbert space inner product (·, ·). To distinguish between these two cases, we
shall use the notation H for Krein spaces and H for Hilbert spaces.

2.15 Definition. A polarized module over a unital ∗-algebra A is a triple
P = (H, π, E) in which one has

2. a faithful unitarizable ∗-representation π of A by continuous linear oper-

3. a closed linear subspace E of H, on which the hermitian form σ(·, ·) van-

1. a Krein space (H, σ(·, ·));

ators in H;

ishes.

We assume, moreover, that

4. the operator T : H → H∗ associated with the bilinear form σ(·, ·) maps
of the

the subspace E onto its annihilator E an in the topological dual H
space H;

∗

20

5. the operator Ta : E → E ∗ from E to its topological dual given by E ∋ x 7→

σ(a·, x), is compact for any a ∈ A.

2.16 Remark.
It would be more appropriate to use the name polarizable
module, but in the interest of simplicity we shall use our current convention.
This notion was ﬁrst introduced in a slightly diﬀerent form in [3].

We remark also that a representation is unitarizable iﬀ there exists a Krein
involution γ such that, in the corresponding Hilbert space Hγ, the representa-
tion π becomes a unitary representation. A suﬃcient condition for this to hold
is the existence of a Krein involution γ commuting with π.

The problem of existence of unitarizable representations of A is closely re-
lated to the similarity problem for a representation of a C∗-algebra, which was
solved in several special cases [9][8].

Our ﬁnal remark on the deﬁnition of the polarized module is that although
it may seem unnatural to single out a ﬁxed subspace of H, there are examples in
which such a subspace appears quite naturally. For instance, in our most impor-
tant case of an even dimensional smooth manifold, the Hilbertian space H will
be the locally convex space of diﬀerential forms in the middle dimension. Then
E is the closed subspace generated by the image of the de Rham diﬀerential.

One can introduce the notion of unitary equivalence of polarized modules
which is analogous to that deﬁned in the case of Fredholm modules. We state
it here for the convenience of the reader.

2.17 Definition. Two polarized modules P i = (Hi, πi, E i), i = 1, 2 are uni-
tarily equivalent iﬀ there exists a Krein-unitary map (i.e., unitary with respect
to the bilinear form σ(·, ·)) U : H1 → H2 such that

U (E 1) = E 2,

π2 = U π1U −1

Polarized modules are more fundamental objects than Fredholm modules as
we now set out to explain. This relation will be important when we discuss the
geometric example of a compact conformal manifold. Our exposition here is a
review and an extension of results from [3].

2.18 Proposition. To any even Fredholm module α = (H, γ, π, F ) one can
associate a unique polarized module.

Proof. We put

σ(x, y) = (x, γy), ∀x, y ∈ H.

This is a continuous hermitian form, which is indeﬁnite and nondegenerate. The
space H equipped with the form σ(·, ·) becomes a Krein space.

Let E be the +1-eigenspace of the involution F . Then E is a closed linear

subspace of H. Moreover, for x and y in E one has

σ(x, y) = (x, γy) = (F x, γF y) = −(F x, F γy) = −σ(x, y),

21

which implies σ(x, y) = 0 for all x and y in E, and so the subspace E is totally
isotropic, as required.

Since the Hilbert space H comes equipped with the orthogonal sum decom-
position H = E ⊕ γ(E), we see that the (Hilbert space) orthogonal complement
E ⊥ of E is E ⊥ = γ(E). Using this fact together with the Riesz representation
theorem we conclude that the annihilator E an of the subspace E is conjugate-
isomorphic with γ(E). In other words, for any ξ ∈ E an there exists a unique
y = γx ∈ γ(E), where x ∈ E such that

ξ = (·, y) = (·, γx) = σ(·, x).

This shows that the map T : x 7→ σ(·, x) from H to dual maps E onto E an.

It remains to check the compactness condition. For any a ∈ A and any

x′, y′ ∈ E we have

(ax′, γy′) = (aP x, γP y)

where x, y ∈ H and P = (1 + F )/2 is the orthogonal projection onto E. So
the compactness of the operator Ta will be proved if we check that the operator
P γaP is compact for any a ∈ A. We have

P γaP = γ(1 − F )a(1 + F )/4
= γ([F, a]F − [F, a])/4

and so the result follows from the compactness condition satisﬁed by the Fred-
holm module.

This way we have deﬁned a polarized module P(α) = (H, π, E) underlying

the Fredholm module α.

2.19 Proposition. Suppose that two Fredholm modules α1 and α2 are unitarily
equivalent. Then the same is true of the underlying polarized modules P(α1) and
P(α2). Moreover, the even unitary map U

U : H1 → H2

intertwining the representations π1 and π2 and the operators F1 and F2, becomes
a Krein unitary map, mapping the subspace E1 onto the subspace E2.

Proof : Let αj = (Hj, πj, Fj ), for j = 1, 2, be two unitarily equivalent Fredholm
modules. One deﬁnes again the corresponding polarized modules P j = P(αj),
for j = 1, 2, as described above. The unitary equivalence of α1 with α2 is
established by means of a map U : H1 → H2, which has the property F2 =
U F1U −1.

It remains to prove that E2 is the image of E1 under the map U . For this
one observes that x ∈ E1 is a +1-eigenvector of F1, i.e. F1x = x which is the
same as U −1F2U x = x. It follows that F2U x = U x, which means that U x ∈ E2.

22

From this it follows that E2 = U (E1). The last statement about the map U is
clear.

It is an important fact that a polarized module can be lifted to an even
Fredholm module. This lift is nonunique, in general, and the freedom of choice
involved here is conveniently described by the action of the M¨obius group, as
we shall see shortly.

2.20 Definition. An involution operator γ in the Krein space H of the po-
larized module P = (H, π, E) is called compatible iﬀ it is a Krein-self ajdoint
involution commuting with the representation π, which makes H into a Hilbert
space equipped with the inner product (·, ·)γ = σ(·, γ·). The set of all compatible
involutions associated with a polarized module P will be denoted ΓP .

We remark that the space of compatible involutions of a given polarized module
is nonempty.

2.21 Proposition. Let γ0 and γ1 be two compatible involutions. Then

γ1 = (1 + m)γ0(1 + m)−1

where m is a uniquely determined operator which is self-adjoint with respect to
the scalar product (·, ·)0 and such that kmk 0 < 1. Moreover, m anticommutes
with γ0 and belongs to the commutant M of the representation π.

Proof. Let Q = γ0γ1. Then Q is a bounded invertible operator, which is positive
with respect to the inner product (·, ·)0. To check the last statement we simply
note that

(x, Qx)0 = (x, γ0γ1x)0 = σ(x, γ1x) = (x, x)1 ≥ 0

We shall now use the Cayley transform, which establishes a 1-1 correspon-
dence between bounded, positive, invertible operators Q and bounded self ad-
joint operators m of norm strictly smaller than 1. More precisely, for each
operator Q there exists a unique operator m

with the inverse relation given by the formula

Thus for a unique m,

and so

Q =

1 − m
1 + m

m =

1 − Q
1 + Q

.

Q = γ0γ1 =

1 − m
1 + m

γ1 = (1 + m)γ0(1 + m)−1

23

To check that m anticommutes with γ0, we use that

(1 + Q)γ0(1 − Q) + (1 − Q)γ0(1 + Q) = 0

which after multiplying on the left by (1 + Q)−1 gives

γ0

1 − Q
1 + Q

+

1 − Q
1 + Q

γ0 = γ0m + mγ0 = 0

as required.

To show that m commutes with π(a), for all a ∈ A, we note that Q has
this property, and then use the Cayley transform together with the continuous
functional calculus to conclude that the same is true for m.

2.22 Proposition. A polarized module P = (H, π, E) can be lifted to a Fred-
holm module α(P) = (H, π, γ, F ), where γ ∈ ΓP .

Proof. Let us choose a compatible involution γ ∈ ΓP . It turns the Krein space
H into a Hilbert space Hγ equipped with the inner product (·, ·)γ = σ(·, γ·).
The Hilbert space Hγ is equipped with the orthogonal direct sum decomposition
Hγ = E ⊕ γ(E). Deﬁne F to be +1 on E and −1 on γ(E). It is clear that F is
an involution anticommuting with γ and that it is self-adjoint with respect to
the inner product (·, ·)γ.

We need to check that the commutator [F, a] is a compact operator for any

a ∈ A. To this end we need to use the assumption that the operator

Ta : E → E ∗;

x 7→ σ(a·, x)

is compact for every a ∈ A. Then also the operator x → (a·, γx)γ is compact,
which in turns shows that the operator P γaP , where P = (1 + F )/2 is the
orthogonal projection onto E, is also compact for any a ∈ A. Multiplying on
the left by γ we see that the operator

γP γaP = (1 − P )aP

is compact, if we use that γP = (1 − P )γ. Since the above equality holds for all
a in A, taking the adjoints we see that the operator P a(1 − P ) is also compact
for all a ∈ A. Adding the two together we get that

(1 − P )aP + P a(1 − P ) = [P, a] = [F, a]/2

is compact. This gives the proof of the result.

2.4 Lifting polarized modules

24

What happens if we lift a given polarized module P = (H, E, π) in two
diﬀerent ways, by choosing two diﬀerent compatible involutions γ1 and γ2 in
ΓP ?

The two choices give rise to two Fredholm modules αj = (Hj, π, γj, Fj ), j =
1, 2, where Hj is the Hilbert equipped with the inner product (·, ·)j = σ(·, γj ·),
and Fj is the involution that is +1 on E and −1 on γ(E). We are going to
construct a map between these Fredholm modules in a few stages.

First we note that the two Hilbert space inner products are related in the

following way. Let x, y ∈ H. Then

(2.23)

(x, y)1 = σ(x, γ1y) = σ(x, γ2

2 γ1y) = (x, γ2γ1y)2.

Let Q = γ2γ1. Then Q is an invertible operator, which is self-adjoint with
respect to the inner product (·, ·)1 as can be seen from the following simple
calculation:

(x, Qy)1 = σ(x, γ0y) = σ(γ0x, y) = (γ0x, γ1y)1 = (γ1γ0x, y)1 = (Qx, y)1.

Moreover, our assumptions about the form σ imply that Q is a positive operator.
Let us denote by W the square root of Q. Then, by 2.23, we may regard W as
a unitary operator W : H0 → H1.
Let g21 be the following matrix

(2.24)

g21 =

A B
B A

(cid:18)

=

 

(cid:19)

2 (1 + Q)
1
2 (1 − Q)

2 (1 − Q)

2 (1 + Q) !

where A and B are regarded as operators from H1 → H2.

2.25 Proposition.

1. A and B commute with the representation π.

2. The operators A and B satisfy Connes identities 1.23.

3. The matrix g21 is invertible and its inverse is given by

g−1
21 =

(cid:18)

A∗ −B∗
−B∗ A∗

.

(cid:19)

4. g21 admits the following ‘right’ polar decomposition (with analogous for-

mula holding for the ‘left’ polar decomposition)

(2.26)

g21 =

(cid:18)

(1 − m2)− 1

where m is the Cayley transform of Q, m = (1−Q)(1+Q)−1 and W = Q

25

Proof. The ﬁrst statement of the Proposition is obvious given that all compatible
involutions commute with π. The second statement, which is checked by a
simple calculation, directly implies the third. Finally, the proof of the polar
decomposition 2.26 requires only a small modiﬁcation of the proof of 1.29.

We remark that the ﬁrst factor on the right in formula 2.26 is just a positive
M¨obius transformation deﬁned relative to the commutant of the representation
π in the Hilbert space H2, whereas the factor on the right is simply a unitary
isomorphism identifying the space H1 with H2.

2.27 Definition. We shall call the matrix g21 a generalized M¨obius transfor-
mation associated with the ordered pair (γ2, γ1) of compatible involutions from
ΓP .

The following result is proved by an easy calculation.

2.28 Proposition. Let γ1, γ2 and γ3 be compatible involutions. Then

g31 = g32g21.

Thus the set of all generalized M¨obius transformations, parametrized by the
set of compatible involutions ΓP , forms a groupoid. Now we construct a map
between the two Fredholm modules αj, which are lifts of the given polarized
module P.

2.29 Proposition. Put

(2.30)

g21(F1) = (AF1 + B)(A + BF1)−1.

Then g21(F1) = F2.

Proof. Let us denote by S±(F ) the ±1 eigenspaces of the involution F . By
deﬁnition of Fj, we have that

S +(Fj) = E
S −(Fj) = γj(E)

for j = 1, 2. It follows that S +(F1) = S+(F2) and γ2γ1S−(F1) = S −(F2). If we
use expressions for A and B, these relations can be expressed as

(A + B)S +(F1) = S+(F1)
(A − B)S −(F2) = S−(F2).

In turn, these two identities can be combined to give

(A + BF1)S ±(F1) = S±(F2)

26

which is equivalent to

F2 = (A + BF1)F1(A + BF1)−1.

This gives the formula 2.30, if we use that F1 is an involution.

Let g21 be the matrix deﬁned in 2.24 whose polar decomposition is given by

2.26. We deﬁne the following action of g21 on the Fredholm module α1:

g21(α1) = (W (H1), W πW −1, W γ1W −1, g(F1))

where g(F1) has the same meaning as in 2.30. We claim that g21(α1) = α2.

We have already checked that W : H1 → H2 is a unitary operator and that

g21(F1) = F2. We need to show that W γ1W −1 = γ2 and that W πW −1 = π

To prove the ﬁrst statement we use the Cayley transform to write Q =

(1 − m)(1 + m)−1 which together with Proposition 2.21 gives

W γ1W −1 =

1
2

1 − m
1 + m
(cid:19)
2 γ2(1 − m2)− 1
= (1 − m2)

(cid:18)

1

(1 + m)γ2(1 + m)−1

− 1
2

1 − m
1 + m

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

Since γ2 anticommutes with m, it commutes with m2, and by the continuous
1
functional calculus it also commutes with (1 − m2)
2 . This gives the required
result. The second statement follows directly from Proposition 2.21 and the
spectral mapping theorem.

Hence we arrive at the following result.

2.31 Proposition. Let αj = (Hj, π, γj, Fj ), j = 1, 2, be two Fredholm module
lifts of a given polarized module P = (H, E, π). Then there exists a generalized
M¨obius transformation

g21 =

(cid:18)

1
2 (1 − γ2γ1)

1
2 (1 − γ2γ1)

2 (1 + γ2γ1) !

such that g21(α1) = α2.

If we now use this Proposition together with the fact that generalized M¨obius
transformations form a groupoid, as described in Proposition 2.28, we obtain
the proof of the following description of the action of generalized M¨obius trans-
formations on the space of lifts of the polarized module P.

2.32 Theorem. Let P = (H, E, π) be a polarized module. The space of all
lifts α = (H, π, γ, F ) of P to a Fredholm module, parametrized by compatible
involutions γ from ΓP , forms a category in which morphisms are provided by
invertible generalized M¨obius transformations 2.24.

2.5 Real structure

Many examples demonstrate that Fredholm modules are readily associated
with C∗ algebras of complex valued functions on a manifold. However, Fredholm
modules that can be associated with a real smooth manifold are equipped with
additional structure which we shall call the real structure.

A real structure on an involutive algebra A is a conjugate linear map c : A →
A with the properties c2 = 1; c(ab) = c(a)c(b), for all a, b in A; c(a∗) = (c(a))∗.

2.33 Definition. An even Fredholm module α = (H, π, F, γ) over an algebra
A equipped with a real structure is called real
iﬀ it possesses a conjugation
operator C : H → H with the following properties:

1. C is conjugate linear and C2 = 1;

2. C is antiunitary, i.e., (Cx, Cy) = (y, x) for all x, y in H;

3. Cγ = ǫγC, with ǫ a ﬁxed factor equal +1 or −1;

4. Cπ(a)C = π(c(a)) for all a in A.

5. CF = F C.

Our main example of a real Fredholm module will be associated with a conformal
manifold of even degree.

In the same vein we can introduce real structure on a polarized module.

2.34 Definition. A polarized module ((H, σ(·, ·)), π, E) over an algebra with
real structure A is called real iﬀ it possesses a conjugation operator C : H → H
with the following properties:

1. C is conjugate-linear and has C2 = 1,

2. σ(Cx, Cy) = ǫσ(y, x), for all x and y in H, with a ﬁxed factor ǫ which is

either +1 or −1.

3. Cπ(a)C = π(c(a)), for all a in A,

4. C(E) = E.

2.35 Proposition. Let α = (H, γ, π, C) be a Fredholm module. Then the un-
derlying polarized module P(α) is also real.

Proof. The proof is a simple matter of comparing the deﬁnitions.

28

3 Conformal structures and Fredholm modules

It has been shown by Connes, Sullivan and Teleman [6][7] that the conformal
structure on a compact oriented even dimensional manifold correspond to Fred-
holm modules over the algebra of smooth functions on that manifold, and in
particular that such conformal structures can be reconstructed from the purely
algebraic data of the Fredholm module. The formalism that has been described
in the preceding section can be seen as a general approach to noncommutative
conformal geometry. From this point of view, a polarized module P encodes
certain features of a ‘noncommutative diﬀerential manifold’whereas the set of
Fredholm modules lying over P describes conformal structures on this manifold.
The M¨obius group, acting on the space of Fredholm modules, transforms the
corresponding conformal structures in a way that cannot be achieved using ori-
entation preserving diﬀeomorphisms. To appreciate the possibilities of this point
of view it may be useful to see in some detail how the commutative example
from ordinary diﬀerential geometry ﬁts in this general algebraic framework.

Let V be an oriented compact 2l-dimensional smooth manifold without
boundary, and let A be the algebra of smooth complex-valued functions over
V . Let us denote by H the space of smooth sections of the bundle Λl(V, T ∗
CV )
of complexiﬁed l-forms on V . H is a locally convex topological space whose
completion, which we shall also denote H is a Hilbertian space. Inside H there
is a canonically determined subspace Imd, which is spanned by forms of the
type dω, where d is the de Rham diﬀerential. Let us denote by E the closure
of this space in H. The space H is also equipped with a canonical continuous
nondegenerate hermitian form

σ(ω, η) = (−i)l

ω ∧ ¯η

ZV

3.1 Lemma. The space E is a closed subspace, which is totally isotropic with
respect to the indeﬁnite form σ(·, ·).

Proof. We have

dω ∧ ¯dη =

d(ω ∧ ¯dη) =

ω ∧ ¯dη = 0.

ZV

ZV

Z∂V

The result now follows by the continuity of the hermitian form σ(·, ·).

The algebra A acts on the space of forms by left multiplication, as does the
C∗-algebra A of continous complex-valued functions on V . Let us denote this
action by π. This data gives our most important example of a polarized module.

3.2 Theorem. The triple P can = (H, E, π) is a polarized module which is
canonically associated with the manifold V .

29

We stress here that to construct this polarized module we only used the
diﬀerentiable structure of the manifold V . It is clearly an interesting question
to discuss possible lifts of this module to a Fredholm module, using the lifting
procedure described in the previous section. We recall that any such lift was
constructed using a compatible involution γ from the set ΓP , and so as a ﬁrst
step we should identify involutions γ that are compatible with P can.

A Riemannian metric g on V is a smooth, nondegenerate symmetric tensor
of order two which is positive deﬁnite everywhere. A conformal structure on V
is by deﬁnition an equivalence class of metrics, where g1 ∼ g2 iﬀ g1 = f g2 for
some smooth real-valued function which is everywhere positive. A choice of a
conformal structure [g] on V gives rise to a Hodge ∗ operator ∗ : H → H which
is used to deﬁne a scalar product

(ω, η) =

ω ∧ ∗¯η

ZV
We denote by H the space H equipped with this inner product. The Hodge
operator is an involution up to a sign and so we can deﬁne the operator γ =
(−i)l∗ which is an involution. Moreover, γ is self-adjoint with respect to both
the indeﬁnite form σ(·, ·) and the inner product (·, ·).

3.3 Lemma. The involution γ is a compatible involution associated with the
polarized module P can.

Proof. This follows directly from the known properties of the Hodge ∗-operator.

The involution γ gives the familiar orthogonal decomposition of H into

spaces of self-dual and anti-self-dual forms:

Let us now assume that the manifold V has trivial cohomology in the middle
dimension, which means that there are no harmonic l-forms on V . Then there
is another decomposition of the space H, namely

Deﬁne F to be the operator which +1 on E and −1 on γ(E). The following
result is then a direct consequence of our lifting procedure.

3.4 Theorem. The operator F is a self-adjoint involution anticommuting with
γ. The data α = (H, γ, π, F ) determine a Fredholm module associated with the
conformal structure [g], which is a lift of the canonical polarized module P can.

H = H0 ⊕ H1.

H = E ⊕ γ(E)

30

We remark that the Fredholm module constructed here is a special case of
the Fredholm module deﬁned by Connes, Sullivan and Teleman for a general
even-dimensional conformal manifold [5, 6, 7].

As this theorem indicates, Fredholm modules contain information about the
conformal structure of the manifold. The M¨obius group, acting on the the
space of Fredholm modules associated with a diﬀerentiable manifold through
the various choices of conformal structure, deforms the underlying conformal
structures in a way that is impossible to obtain using orientation preserving
diﬀeomorphisms. Thus it seems plausible that M¨obius transformations would
have some relation to the deformation theory of conformal structures (see, e.g.
[11]). This point will need to be investigated further.

In the case when V has nontrivial cohomology in the middle dimension, the
above construction produces a pre-Fredholm module in the sense that the op-
erator F is not an involution but has the property that 1 − F 2 is a compact
operator. (In fact it is of ﬁnite rank in this case.) As was shown by Connes
in his seminal paper [4], any pre-Fredholm module can be lifted to a Fredholm
module, thus yielding a Fredholm module associated with a conformal struc-
ture on V . Fredholm modules are clearly useful especially when one wants to
construct the corresponding characters (cyclic cocycles), but it transpires that
pre-Fredholm modules already contain interesting geometric information. There
is a modiﬁcation of the theory of M¨obius transformations that ﬁts that case,
and it will be developed in a forthcoming paper.

3.5 Remark. The polarized and Fredholm modules constructed in this section
are in fact real, in the sense of Deﬁnitions 2.33 and 2.34.

3.6 Remark. To construct a conformal structure from a given Fredholm
module, Connes [5, p. 334] uses the following formula to calculate L2l-forms of
one-forms on V :

(cid:17)
Here Trω is the Dixmier trace. We want to show that unitarily equivalent
Fredholm modules give the same conformal class. But this is clear from our
localization theorem 2.5, which shows that it is suﬃcient to prove this statement
for unitary operators that belong to the commutant of a ﬁxed representation of
the algebra A. In this case the unitary m ∈ U(M ) acts by

P

Thus the norm, and therefore the associated conformal class, does not change
under this transformation.

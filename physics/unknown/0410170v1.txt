Abstract 

Electric propulsion is now a successful method for primary propulsion of deep space long duration missions and for geosyncronous 

satellite attitude control. Closed Drift Plasma Thruster, so called Hall Thruster or SPT (stationary plasma thruster) was primarily 

conceived in USSR (the ancient Soviet Union) and since then, it has been developed by space agencies, space research institutes 

and industries in several countries such as France, USA, Israel, Russian Federation and Brazil. In this article, we present the main 

features of the Permanent Magnet Hall Thruster (PMHT) developed at the Plasma laboratory of the University of Brasilia. The idea 

of  using  an  array  of  permanent  magnets,  instead  of  an  electromagnet,  to  produce  a  radial  magnetic  field  inside  the  cylindrical 

plasma drift channel of the thruster is very significant, specially because of the possibility of developing a Hall Thruster with power 

consumption  low  enough  to  be  used  in  small  and  medium  size  satellites.  Descriptions  such  as  the  plasma  density,  temperature 

space profiles inside and outside the thruster channel, ion temperature measurements based on Doppler broadening of spectral lines  

and  ion  energy  measurements  are  shown  for  different  plasma  production  regimes,  the  space  plasma  potential,  the  measured 

propulsion and power consumption are shown through the paper.  We also compare our data with the results reached by other types 

of thrusters. Finally, some of the most significant events on the evolution of the electric propulsion and their contributions to the 

progress on the space missions are reviewed.  

I. INTRODUCTION 

Space  exploration  is  closely  tied  to  the  rocket  engines  development.  One  of  the  key  issues 

necessary to accomplish long duration space missions is the jet propellant velocity and its capability of long 

periods of rocket acceleration. The propulsion of spacecrafts with plasmas - also called electric propulsion - 

 

 

 

 

 

was  first  thought  by  Robert  Goddart  in  USA  (1912)  and  independently  followed  by  Herman  Oberth  in 

Germany (1930) [1]. Years later, the first technical study on the application of electric propulsion to space 

missions was presented on an article by Ernest Stuhlinger at the 1955 International Astronautical Congress 

in  Viena.  Since  then,  many  authors  -  assisted  by  several  plasma  physics  methods  and  techniques  -  have 

been  examining  the  necessary  requirements  for  the  construction  of  propulsion  systems  based  on  charged 

particles  accelerated  by  eletromagnetic  fields.  In  fact,  one  of  the  most  attractive  advantages  of  electric 

propulsion  is  the  reduction  of  propellant  mass  for  a  given  space  mission  because  plasma  thrusters  can 

generate higher exhaust velocities than those reached by chemical rockets based on combustion processes. 

In  1964,  NASA  launched  the  first  series  of  satellites  with  ion  thrusters.  They  were  based  on  ion 

source models originaly made by A. T. Forrester (1959) and developed for space purposes by H. Kaufman 

(1960) [2]. The best results with the Kaufman source or electron bombardment ion source was obtained on 

DEEP SPACE 1 mission in 2000. It was a space probe sent by JPL/NASA to study the comet Borelly. It 

completed 4800 hours of continuos operation with 10mN thrust. 

Today,  space  propulsion  systems  based  on  plasmas  are  renewing  the  space  mission  planning 

because the propellant is a substantial part of the space vehicle mass. It corresponds to 55% - 65% of the 

mass in most of geostationary satellite missions and 70% to 80% in planetary missions. After half century 

of science and technology improvements, electric propulsion is now allowing significant mass reduction. In 

low earth orbit missions, mass reduction factors from 2 to 3 can be reached due to the higher efficience of 

gas  ionization  and  plasma  charged  particles  acceleration  method.  On  fig.1  the  plot  of  propellant  mass  to 

total  spacecraft  ratio  (

)  is  shown  for  several  specific  impulse  ( spI

)  values  [2].  Note  that  the  electric

propulsion devices have typically

spI

station keeping and easier control of satellite locations on space  increases the satellite life time . Launch 

base  effects  are  minimized  and  the  window  launch  time  is  improved  when  plasma  thrusters  are  used  on 

space missions. 

 

 

 

The  Hall  Thruster  ,  also  known  as  closed  electron  drift  thruster  or  SPT  (Stationary  Plasma 

Thruster)  was  primarily  developed  in  the  ancient  USSR  (now  Russia)  in  1960.  At  that  time,  the  simple 

design and working principles were the main attractive properties of this plasma thruster concept. The first 

space  mission with a 60mN thrust SPT was  made by Russia in 1972 with the Meteor satellite series  [3]. 

After this initial sucessfull operation, more than 100 Hall Thrusters were tested  in several Russian space 

missions. Since 1995, most of the research and development of Hall Thrusters have been made on France. 

A joint enterprise between CNES and SNECMA was created to develop SPT with 100 mN of total thrust. 

They have been operating in GTO (geostationary) telecommunication satellites since 2002. One of the most 

triumphant thrusters developed by the French researchers is installed in the ESA Moon mission SMART-1, 

launched in October 2003.  

It  is  important  to  compare  the  closed  drift  thruster  with  others  known  methods  of  plasma 

propulsion. Eletrothermal or resistorjet and arcjet are based on heat mechanisms of plasma  acceleration. 

The  SPT  family  is  part  of  the  MPD  (Magneto  Plasma  Dynamics)  and  MHD  (Magneto  hydrodynamic) 

thrusters    based  on  eletromagnet  mechanisms  of    acceleration.  Thrusters  with  eletrostatic  acceleration  of 

ions are based on electron bombardment and RF ion sources with electrically polarized grid acceleration 

systems [4]. On fig. 2 the working regions of several plasma thrusters and chemical rockets are compared 

on a graph that relates the thrust (T ) and the specific impulse ( spI

). They are given respectively by:

In this work, we show the results of a new closed drift thruster with a one-staged magnetic layer 

that has been developed at the Plasma Laboratory of UnB [5]. The new feature of this thruster is a magnetic 

field  generated  by  permanent  ceramic  magnets  (ferrite).  The  absence  of  electromagnet  coils  is  the  main 

advantage of the Permanent Magnet Hall Thruster (PMHT). With this new arrangement it is possibe to save 

about 200W in energy consumption, while keeping the same thrust obtained by the SPT family. It is also 

possible to simplify the thruster transponder and power electronics by using the proposed arrangements of 

permanent magnets for Hall current generation. 

II HALL THRUSTER PRINCIPLES 

The  main  advantage  of  the  SPT  is  its  comparative  low  power  consumption  (0.1  to  1.0KW)  with 

respect to its total thrust capability (0.1N to 10N). It allows the SPT use as primary propulsion system for 

long space missions, because it can produce higher plasma flux density. It is also important to point out that 

with the absence of polarized grids, the probability of undesired effects caused by ion sputtering decreases. 

The  SPT  can  work  with  a  single  cathod  and  requires  low  number  of  components  to  be  controlled  which 

means easier access and maintenance of the plasma source components. 

A schematic drawing of the Hall Thruster principles is shown on fig. 3. It  consists of a dieletric 

channel,  a  ring  anode,  an  external  cathod  and  a  radial  magnetic  field.  The  basic  operation  principle  is 

described by the condutivity tensor for the Hall Thruster, given by:

In the proper operating regime, the electron Hall conductivity parameter is larger than unity and the 

electron  Larmor  radius  (

)  has  to  be  small  compared  to  the  typical  channel  depth

(

), in order to magnetize  only the electrons. On the other hand, the Larmor radius of the much 

heavier  ions  (

)  is  larger  than  the  channel  dimension.  For  this  reason,  they  are  weakly 

affected by the magnetic field [6]. This condition is given by:

Under  the  influence  of  the  axial  electric  and  radial  magnetic  fields,  the  electrons  drift  in  the 

azimutal  direction  (azimuthal  Hall  current).  Due  to  collisions,  electrons  diffuse  across  the  magnetic  field 

towards the anode (axial electron current) and ionize by impacts the working gas atoms emerging form the 

anode.  The  axial  dependence  of  the  electron  mobility  depends  on  the  magnetic  field  profile.  This  is  the 

main physical mechanism to determine the axial space plasma potencial drop associated with the exausted 

plasma beam current. 

III PLASMA SOURCE AND DIAGNOSTICS DESCRIPTION 

A standard glass bell jar vacuum system with a volume of 0.2m3 (see fig.4a ) fore pump with pump 

velocity of 35m3 /h and diffusion pump velocity of 500l/s is able to maintain 10-4torr to 10-5torr of working 

pressure in the vacuum chamber. In order to clean the system between working periods, a cryogenic trap is 

used to decrease the bell jar background pressure to 10-6 torr. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Hall thruster plasma source is positioned at the bottom of the bell jar in order to allow a plasma 

drift length of 0.7m. The plasma plume near the channel (fig.4b), is clearly similar to the SPT but it is also 

possible  to  see  a  plasma  beam  going  away  from  the  plasma  source  indicating  that  some  plasma  is 

accelerated by 

×  forces in the PMHT  within an extended  acceleration zone outside the channel  [7].

The plasma source chamber is made of stainless steel with ionization channel cover by a thin ceramic layer 

within 2mm thickness. The anode ring is 2cm wide and 1mm thick. It is also made of stainless steel and it 

is  positioned  3.8cm  from  the  exit  of  the  channel.  Behind  the  anode  ring,  the  propellant  gas  is  uniformly 

distributed in the Hall plasma source chamber by using an isolated copper circular tube with several small 

holes.  

 

 

 

The  Hall thruster schematics of the plasma source and circuits can be seen on fig. 5. It shows a 

cross  section  view  of  the  thruster  with  permanent  magnet  locations,  anode  ring,  thermionic  cathode,  gas 

feed tube, electrical supplies and plasma diagnostics. The plasma is generated by a discharge between the 

anode ring and a negatively polarized directed heated cathode. This simple thermionic cathode is made of a 

5.5cm long and 2mm thick tungsten wire cover by BaO in order to increase electron emission. By using 

this type of cathode it is possible to move it and  choose its best position outside the ionization channel, 

which is 3.0cm outside the channel exit. 

Electric and magnetic fields geometry are key issues in the permanent magnet Hall thruster design. 

The shape of these fields controls ion trajectories and the acceleration zone. Although a desirable magnetic 

field  can  be  obtained  by  adjusting  permanent  magnet  relative  positions  around  the  channel,  a  computer 

simulation  study  of    possible  magnetic  field  geometries  was  performed  using  FEMM  (Finite  Element 

Method Magnetics). The best  magnetic field design was chosen from these studies. 

Fig. 6 shows  computer simulated magnetic field lines of the Hall thruster for two concentric circles 

with 76 permanent magnets bars (16 on the internal cylinder) with 6.0cm length and cross section of 1.0cm 

x 2.0cm. The radial component of the magnetic field for several distances from the source axis is shown on 

fig.  7.  The  magnetic  field  space  profile  along  the  channel  has  a  maximum  value  of  350  gauss,  near  the 

channel  exit  and  0.5cm  from  the  external  wall.  At  the  center  of  the  channel  a  magnetic  field  gradient 

>  was obtained with this magnet arrangement. It is important to point out that in this arrangement, 

0

other  magnetic  field  components  (axial  and  poloidal)  are  also  present  in  the  thruster  channel.  They  may 

contribute to the generation of better plasma conditions in the ionization channel and higher plasma drift 

flux and the Hall current in the plasma source channel [8].

Plasma diagnostics inside and outside the source were made by using a movable Langmuir probe 

and an ion energy analyzer. The cylindrical Langmuir probe (0.25mm x 3.5mm)  can be oriented parallel or 

perpendicular  to  the  thruster  axis  in  order  to  provide  plasma  density,  plasma  potencial  and  temperature 

space  profiles.  The  probe  size  was  designed  to  minimize  pertubation  on  the  plasma.  We  obtained  the 

plasma density, temperature and distribution function using the Druyvensteyn method, which consists on 

taking the second derivative of the characteristic curve (I x U) measured with the Langmuir probe [10]. The 

distribution function F can be determined from the retarding potential of the probe (U):

Willing to measure the plasma beam energy profile, we used a plane moveable electrode known as 

the ion “Faraday cup”, which allows the measurement of the drifting plasma flux current space distribution 

and the correspondent ion energy. The ion probe was positioned 35cm from the acceleration channel exit. It 

was  fixed  with  an  experimental  arrangement  that  allowed  radial  and  angular  movements  permitting  the 

sketch of the space distribution profile of the accelerated plasma .The obtained data are showed in fig.13, 

where we can see some asymmetry that occurs because of the use of a hot filament cathode just above the 

channel exit. In fig.13, the relative cathode angular position is  -10°  from the vertical line. 

In order to perform a non-perturbative measurement of the ion temperature inside the channel, we 

use a plasma spectroscopy technique. It is based on the well known line broadening of spectral lines caused 

by several atomic processes inside the plasma.  

Based on the analysis of the experimental conditions in the plasma Hall current channel, we were 

able  to  determine  the  appropriate  statistical  model  to  be  applied  on  the  interpretation  of  the  measured 

spectral lines. Collisional ionization and excitation,  charge exchange and radioactive recombination are the 

predominant processes that affect the radiation emitted by the plasma, and a model which includes these 

phenomena  is  satisfactorily  suitable  for  this  experimental  conditions.  The  broadening  of  spectral  lines  is 

one  of  the  consequences  of  the  several  perturbative  effects  on  the  atomic  systems  caused  by  these 

processes. 

 

 

 

 

Line  broadening  can  be  driven  by  several  mechanism  such  as  Stark  and  Zeeman  effects  when 

strong electric and magnetic fields are applied to the plasma. High pressures can also produce collisional 

line enlargement; nevertheless, inside the Hall plasma source, the  Doppler Broadening of spectral lines is 

one of the predominant characteristics of the thermal particle motion.  

In  order  to  evaluate  the  ion  temperature  of  the  plasma,  the  Doppler  broadening  of  the  plasma 

radiation  was  measured.  This  method  is  based  on  the  difference  between    the  wavelength  emitted  by  a 

moving ion  and the wavelength that would be detected if the ion were at rest. This broadening is given by:

IV EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  

The PMHT can be easily operated with anode bias voltage going from 150Volts to 700Volts. The 

discharge plasma current for most of the experimental conditions ranged between 0.1 to 1.5A in argon gas 

pressures varying from 10-2torr to 10-4torr. A  calibration curve of mass flow gas feeding to the PMHT is 

shown on fig. 8. In this paper, we call the 0.1A discharge the low thrust regime, and the 1.5A discharge 

(with  150  to  200Volts),  the  higher  thrust  operational  regime.  The  tungsten  wire  covered  with  BaO  hot 

cathode works with temperature of 900oC emitting 1A/cm2 of primary electrons to generate the discharge. 

In  the  highest  pressure  conditions,  the  electron  plasma  density  and  temperature  space  profiles 

inside  the  plasma  source  channel  are  respectively  in the  range  of  2.0  -  2.5x1010part/cm3  and  temperature 

from 30eV to 120eV (see figs. 9  and 10). Plasma potential space profile (see fig. 11) shows that inside the 

plasma source the anode determines the plasma potential maintaining the average anode bias voltage inside 

the  plasma  channel.  Outside  the  channel,  the  potential  decreases  mainly  due  to  the  plasma  neutralization 

made  by  the  thermionically  emitted  electrons.  It  was also  observed  that  plume  expansion  creates  density 

gradient.  The  plasma  acceleration  is  measured  using  an  ion  energy  analyzer.  The  drifting  ion  energy 

distribution function is proportional to 

 and  a derivation of analyzer characteristic curve was made by 

dI
dV

a computational code. It clearly shows two peaks indicating that ion energies are about 350eV and 600eV, 

for a 650Volts discharge (see fig.12).  

 

In spite of low frequency oscillations [9] found in the ion probe measurements, we calculated the 

total thrust of the PMHT. The results from the ion collector current are placed in the interval of 18mN to 

39mN indicating that the PMHT is working with 27% of efficiency - as expected for this first experimental 

 

 

 

 

model. If the total thrust is calculated from the input power in the Hall discharge, the maximum thrust goes 

from 44mN to 80mN . Hence, our PMHT has only 43% of the maximum thrust that can be obtained from 

this discharge. These values can at least be scaled up to the thrust values of the existent SPT. 

V CONCLUSION 

A  new  conception  of  closed  drift  Hall  thruster  using  permanent  magnets  was  developed.  The 

results  obtained  on  the  magnetic  field  geometry  and  strength,  the  plasma  density  temperature,  the  thrust 

measured by ion collector probe and ion energy analyzer are motivating results to forthcoming tests. 

In  the  ion  temperature  measurement,  we  estimated  that  the  velocity  distribution  is  maxwellian. 

However,  our  recent  experiments  showed  a  two-electron  temperature  plasma  inside  the  acceleration 

channel.  Even  though,  the  Doppler  broadening  is  a  very  adequate  method  of  obtaining  the  ion 

characteristics for it is a non-intrusive technique. 

 In  spite  of  the  use  of  simple  materials  easily  found  on  brazillian  industrial  market  and  the 

utilization of Argon instead of Xenon, the new PMHT Hall thruster allowed the production of remarkable 

working characteristics. The extra economy on satellite energy consumption is the main advantage of this 

new design.

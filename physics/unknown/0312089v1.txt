We  consider  spectrum-angular  characteristics  of  the  undulator-type  radiation  emitted  by  a  bunch  of  relativistic  charged 
particles because of interacting with the nonsynchronous spatial harmonics of the transverse wakefields excited by this bunch as 
it moves in a periodic structure. The conditions acceptable for possible experimental verification when incoherent undulator-type 
radiation power exceeds power loss associated with exciting the wakefields are discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Studies of the undulator type radiation, emitted by a 
beam  of  relativistic  charged  particles  undulating  in  the 
alternating wakefields induced by this beam as it moves 
in  a  periodic  structure,  is  an  interesting  area  of 
accelerator  and  FEL  physics.  Recently  it  has  received 
certain  development  in  the  works  [1-5].  Two  new 
for 
radiation  mechanisms  have  been  proposed 
generating  ultra-short  wavelength  light.  In  Refs.  [1,2] 
the  quasi-static  image  charge  fields  produced  by  sheet 
electron  beam  passing  between  two  periodic  grating 
surfaces  were  considered  as  wiggler  type  fields,  and  a 
new  device  called  the  image  charge  undulator  was 
proposed. These image charge fields dominate when the 
bunch length much longer than the maximal wavelength 
λmax of the Cherenkov-type radiation, CR, emitted by an 
electron  in  the  periodic  structure.  (The  term  CR  covers 
different  names  of  the  radiation,  emitted  by  a  charged 
particle  moving  with  constant  velocity  in  periodic 
structures,  such  as  Smith-Purcell,  diffraction,  quasi-
cherenkov,  resonant-transition,  parametric-cherenkov 
radiation, etc. [6].) 

When  the  bunch  length  shorter  than  λmax,  the  fields 
of  the  coherent  Cherenkov-type  radiation  become 
prevalent  wakefields,  WF.  In  this  case,  as  it  has  been 
shown  in  Refs.  [3-5],  transverse  components  of  the 
nonsynchronous  spatial  wakefield  harmonics  acting  on 
particles  can  give  rise  to  their  undulating  motion  and 
consequently to generating the undulator-type radiation, 
UR.  The  theory  of  the  fundamental  mechanism  of  the 
radiation  emitted  by  ultrarelativistic  charged  single-
particle  in  its  own  wakefield  induced  in  an  infinitely 
long  periodic  structure  was  given  in  [4,5].  As  follows 
from  the  theory,  in  the  relatively  long-wave  spectral 
region,  where  diffraction  of  generated  waves 
is 
essential,  the  radiation  manifests  itself  in  the  coherent 
interference of WF and UR. A pure UR takes place only 
in the relatively ultra-short wave range where the wave 
diffraction can be neglected. The power of coherent UR 
emitted by a bunch of N particles is proportional to N 4 
[4].  At 
is 
proportional to N 3 [5]. 

incoherent  emission 

the  UR  power 

In  the  present  paper  we  will  consider  UR  spectral–
angular  characteristics  for  relativistic  charged  particles 
of 
transverse 
interacting 

components 

with 

 

 

spatial  harmonics  of 

nonsynchronous 
self-
wakefields excited in a periodic structure. Also we will 
analyze  conditions  when  incoherent  UR  power  can 
exceed beam loss power needed for exciting wakefields.

2. RADIATION BY SINGLE-PARTICLE 

We  will  consider  a  vacuum  corrugated  waveguide 
with  metallic  surface  as  a  periodic  structure.  Let  a 
particle  with  the  ultrarelativistic  longitudinal  velocity 
v0,  the  charge  e,  and  the  mass  m  moves  through  the 
structure with the period, D. The UR power emitted by 
the  particle 
the  spectral  region  where  wave 
diffraction  can  be  neglected  (ωpe<ω),  is  given  in  the 
dipole approximation in the form [4]

However the dimensions σ of bunches accelerated in

well  as  ωре<<2Ωγ2.  So,  it  is  of  interest  to  consider 
features of incoherent hard radiation emitted by existing

As  shown  in  Fig.1,  the  bunch  head,  up  to  50  µm, 
basically excites WF while UR is predominantly emitted 
by the next part after head of the bunch (see Fig.2).

Fig. 3. The UR and WF power vs. the bunch length. 
 
Eqs. (5)-(7)  shows  that  in  the  range  of  ultra-sort 
wavelength  light  the  UR  power  grows  as  square  of 
particle energy. Therefore, we can expect, that for very 
high energy particles the UR power can exceed the WF 
power  which,  as  well  known,  is  independent  on  the 
particle energy. Figs. 1, 2 indicate a possible increase of 
the  relative  fraction  of  the  UR  power  as  the  bunch 
length  grows.  This  assumption  is  confirmed  by  Fig. 3. 
As  seen,  the  incoherent  UR  power  of  50  GeV  beam 
reaches the WF power at the bunch length 200 µm.

when the UR power equals the WF power. 
 

In  the  Fig. 5  we  represent  the  dependence  of  a 
number  of  electrons  in  the  bunch  of  length  500  µm  on 
their energy in the case when the incoherent UR power 
equals WF power. This dependence determines the limit, 
above  of  which  the  incoherent  UR  power  exceeds  the 
power of the wakefield excitation.

the 
undulator-type  radiation  of  an  ultrarelativistic  charged 
particle 
spatial 
harmonics  of 
the  periodic 
structure  have  been  obtained.  Using  the  model  of  a 
weakly  corrugated  circular  waveguide  excited  by  an 
infinitesimally thin uniform electron bunch, it has been 
shown numerically that whereas the beam power losses 
fall  as  the  bunch  length  grows,  the  relative  fraction  of 
the  UR  power  increases.  The  conditions  when  the 
incoherent UR power becomes comparable with the WF 
power  have  been 
found.  These  conditions  are 
acceptable  for  possible  experimental  verification  at 
SLAC Linac [7].

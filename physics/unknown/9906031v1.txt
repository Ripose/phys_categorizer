Exponential Decay of the Overall Universe
is the Cause of
"The Apparent Anomalous, Weak, Long-Range
Acceleration of [the spacecraft] Pioneer 10 and 11" 1

Roger Ellman

In  order  to  develop  the  concept,  consider  the  following  "thought  experiments"

(similar to the technique of Einstein).

1. Electric Field

- Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, c. Given two static electric charges
separated and with the usual Coulomb force between them, if one of the charges is
moved the change can produce no effect on the other charge until a time equal to the
distance between them divided by c has elapsed.

- To produce that effect there must be something flowing from the one charge to the

other at speed c and, therefore, the charge must be the source of that flow.

The  Coulomb  effect  is  radially  outward  from  the  charge,  therefore  every
charge  must  be  propagating  such  a  flow  radially  outward  in  all  directions
from itself, which flow must be the "electric field".

2.- Motion of Charge and "At Rest"

- We compare two such charges, one moving at constant velocity relative to the other.

At least one of the charges is moving with some velocity, v.

- The flow (of "field") outward from that charge must always travel at c. Forward it
would go at [c+v] if propagated at c from the source charge already moving that
way at v. Therefore, it must be sent forward from the charge at [c-v] so that it will
travel at c when the v of its source charge is added.

- Analogously,  rearward  it  would  go  at  speed  [c-v]  if  propagated  at  c  from  the
source charge already moving the opposite way at v. Therefore, it must be emitted
rearward from the charge at [c+v] so that it will travel at speed c when the v of the
source charge in the opposite direction is subtracted.

- But, that means that the direction and speed of motion can be determined by looking

at the propagation pattern of the flow as propagated by the charge.

And, if the pattern were the same in all directions then the charge would be
truly  "at  rest",  which  means  that  there  is  an  absolute  "at  rest"  frame  of
reference.

3. Magnetic & Gravitational Fields

- Except for the kind of field, all of the preceding applies in the same way and with the

same conclusions for magnetic field and gravitational field as for electric field.

- Therefore, either a particle that exhibits all three such fields, as for example a proton
or  an  electron,  is  a  source  of  three  separate  and  distinct  such  flows,  one  for  each
field, or there is only  a  single such flow  which produces  all three  effects: electric,
magnetic, and gravitational.

The  only  reasonable  conclusion  is  that  electric  field,  magnetic  field,  and
gravitational field are different effects of the same sole flow from the source
particles.

2

4. Sources & Their Decay

- The  flow  is  not  inconsequential.  Rather,  it  is  substantial  in  that  it  produces  the

forces, actions and energies of our universe.

- For a particle to emit such a flow the particle must be a source of whatever it is that

is emitted and then flows outward. The particle must have a supply of it.

- The process of emitting the flow from a particle must deplete the supply resource for
the  particle's  emitting  further  flow,  must  use  up  part  of  its  supply,  else  we  would
have something-from-nothing and a violation of conservation.

We must conclude that an original supply [of whatever the flow is, which we
now call "medium"] came into existence at the beginning of the universe and
has  since  been  gradually  being  depleted  at  each  particle  by  its  on-going
outward flow.

Of course, this also forces the conclusion that the universe had a beginning, a
refutation of  "steady state" theories.

5. The Beginning

- Before the universe began there was no universe. Immediately afterward there was
the initial supply of medium to be  propagated by  particles.  How can  one  get  from
the former  to  the  latter  while: (1)  not involving  an  infinite  rate  of change,  and  (2)
maintaining conservation ?

The only form that can accommodate the change from nothing to something
in a smooth transition without an infinite rate of change is the oscillatory form
A·[1-Cosine(2π·f·t)].

The  only  way  that  such  a  form  can  come  into  existence  without  violating
conservation is for there simultaneously to come into existence a second form
of equal magnitude, identical in every sense except that it is opposite, cancels,
yields  a  net  nothing,  results  in  zero,  in  combination  with  the  first  form,  in
effect -A·[1-Cosine(2π·f·t)].

Summary

The  amplitude,  A,  of  the  [1-Cosine]  form  oscillation  corresponds  to  the
amplitude  of  the  flow  emitted  from  the  source  particle,  which  flow
corresponds to the electric field. Thus the oscillation amplitude corresponds to
the charge magnitude -- the fundamental electric charge, q, in the case of the
corresponding fundamental particles.

The  frequency,  f,  of  the  [1-Cosine]  form  oscillation  corresponds  to  the
energy and mass of the source particle, that is the energy of the oscillation is W
= h·f and the mass is m = W/c2 = h·f/c2.
The  amplitude  +A  versus  -A  distinction  that  maintains  conservation
corresponds to, and is, our positive and negative charge distinction.
The  Amplitude  magnitude,  |A|,  decays  exponentially  (because  the  amount
available to supply further emission is the depleted value) as A ·ε-t/τ.  That is,
both  the  magnitude  of  the  remaining  "supply"  and  the  amplitude  of  the
propagated oscillation decay exponentially as ε-t/τ.

A number of further results with regard to magnetic field, electromagnetic field,
the photon, quantization, quantum mechanics, atomic and nuclear structure, gravitation,
and  so  forth    develop  from  the  foregoing  investigation.    However,  those  all  are  a

3

diversion from this paper's specific topic, which is the relationship of the universal decay
to the Pioneer satellite data.

For that purpose the significant result of the foregoing is the fact of a universal
decay.  That was obtained starting from an established fact, the speed limitation of c, then
developing in simple, logical steps, the unavoidable consequences

But, just what is decaying ?  The "supply" [of "medium"] and its flow account for
electric,  magnetic  and  gravitational field  per the foregoing.    The  flow  is  at  velocity  c.
The  flow  must  be  a  flow  of  something  that  propagates  at  c.    The  decay  of  that  flow
requires that the quantity c itself be decaying.

Universal  decay  of  the  speed  of  light  means  that  astronomical  red  shifts  are
dominantly due to that decay rather than the Doppler effect.  That is, the attribution of red
shifts  solely  to  the  Doppler  effect  requires  immense  recession  velocities  in  immense
masses after they have experienced several billion years of gravitational deceleration (star
formation  is  estimated  to  have  begun  2½  to  3  billion  years  after  the  Big  Bang)  at
separation distances of the gravitational masses much smaller (gravitational deceleration
forces  much  greater)  than  those  of  today.    Such  immense  velocities  would  seem
unreasonable.    On  the  other  hand,  the  light  now  arriving  from  distant  stars,  emitted
billions of years ago at a greater value of c, would exhibit a longer wavelength, the red
shift in fact observed.

Thus, decay of c is a much more reasonable and likely dominant cause of red
shifts (a minor component being the Doppler shift due to moderate recession velocities)
than  solely  the  Doppler  effect  as  was  assumed  by  Hubbell.    The  universe  must
nevertheless be expanding because a universe that had a beginning [per 4., above] must
have originated at a point, not over an immense volume all at once.

The various physical constants are interrelated through the laws of physics.  With
c  decaying  the  other  fundamental  constants  must  also  decay.    The  individual  decay  of
each  of  the  constants,  c,  h,  q,  G,  etc.,  must  be  consistent  with  that  of  each  of  the
others, that is, when those quantities as decaying variables interact in the various laws of
physics the resulting decays must be consistent.  The situation is exactly the same as the
essential  requirement  that  the  dimensions  in  which  quantities  are  measured  must  be
overall consistent with each other when those quantities are involved together in physical
laws.

For  that  purpose,  the  dimensions  of  the  quantities  being  dealt  with  need  to  be
clarified  here.    A  full  discussion  of  dimension  systems  will  be  found  in  Section  3,
"Physical  Units  and  Standards"  of  Handbook  of  Engineering  Fundamentals,  First
Edition, Ovid W. Eshbach, New York, John Riley & Sons, 1947, as well as other works.
Per Eshbach, one could use a different dimension for each physical quantity but it is more
economical  (as  well  as  more  succinctly  clear)  to  use  a  small  set  of  "fundamental"
dimensions with the remainder of the quantities having their dimensions expressed as a
combination of the "fundamental" dimensions according to the physical laws (expressed
in mathematical relationships) that pertain.

In principal any sufficiently complete set of quantities might be chosen to be the
"fundamental" ones; however, practice has been to essentially always make length [L]
and  time  [T]  fundamental.    Usually  to  those  is  then  added  mass  [M],  those  three
being  the  common  dimensions  of  mechanics.    (It  can  be  observed  that  these  three
dimensions  seem  rather  natural  and  fundamental  to  we  humans,  perhaps  out  of  habit,
perhaps because of the nature of material reality.)

4

Again per Eshbach, a minimum of three fundamental dimensions is sufficient for
mechanics  but  a  fourth  is  needed  to  treat  "heat"  and / or  "electromagnetism".    In  heat
systems  the  added  fundamental  dimension  is  usually  temperature  [Θ]  (because  time
already uses "T").  In treatments of electromagnetism the added fundamental dimension
is found to be charge [Q] in some cases and permeability [µ] in others with several
systems not using [M] and having two special fundamental dimensions that include one
or more of: electric current [I], voltage [V], and resistance [R].

The  present  analysis  and  development  treats  all  phenomena  as  reduced  to
mechanics.  Only the common three fundamental dimensions [M], [L], and [T] are
required.  Charge, for example, can readily be related to these three dimensions by means
of  Coulomb's  and  Newton's  laws.    Briefly  (using  the  notation  "{x}"  to  mean  "the
dimensions of x"), the development is as follows.

the  fine  structure  constant,  is  dimensionless  as
{c∙q2} = {h} = M∙L2/T.)

The  decay  so  far  addressed, that  of  the  speed  of light,  c,  has  the  dimensional
units and decay data as in Table 1, below.  Does that decay represent decay of mass [M],
of length [L], of time [T] or of some combination of them ?

Time cannot decay.  It is the independent variable.  It is only made measurable
by  the  occurrence  of  events,  changes  which  occur  in  realized  space,  the  volume
dimensions.  Time being the independent variable of material reality, whether it decays,
varies,  or  is  rigorously  constant  is  beyond  our  ability  to  detect  in  any  case.    For  us  it
cannot but appear constant.

Mass  might  be  thought  to  be  able  to  decay,  especially  in  that  we  "feel"  about
mass as that it is substantial.  But mass is merely the ratio of applied force to resulting
acceleration.  Mass is proportional to frequency, f, per the familiar relationship m∙c2

Table 1

6

=  h∙f.    As  with  time,  frequency,  time's  inverse,  cannot  decay  nor  "anti-decay"  and,
therefore, neither can mass.

Then the decay of Table 1 must be decay of the length [L] aspect of reality by
default.  Applying that conclusion to some other fundamental physical quantities Table 1
becomes Table 2, below.  For the table the mechanical dimensions of the quantities were
developed in equation (1), above, except for the Gravitation Constant, G, for which the
dimensions develop as follows.

Decay Rates of Fundamental Physical Quantities
Table 2

All  of  the  decays  are  exponentials  with  the  same  base,  ε  (the  natural
logarithmic base, not the dielectric constant).  In applying these decay rates to the laws of
physics,  which  are  expressed  in  equations  involving  these  quantities,  the  algebra  of
exponents applies.  In equations with  multiplication  of  variables  exponents  to the same
base  are  added  and  for  division  they  are  subtracted.    Consequently,  to  find  the  overall
relative decay rate for an expression the relative decay rates of Table 2 should be added
or  subtracted  correspondingly.    The  decay  constant  is  τ  times  the  reciprocal  of  the
relative decay rate.

This procedure, taking the general universal decay to be a decay of the dimension
length, [L], is further justified by the results when it is applied to various physical laws.
For example, consider the results in Table 3 below, in which the dimensions of the same
quantity are obtained via two different physical laws.  The result must be the same, that is
any quantity can have only one set of fundamental mechanical dimensions.

If  one  attempts  to  achieve  this  type  of  result,  the  proper  correlation  of  related
quantities,  using  the  assumption  that  the  fundamental  decay  of  medium  is  a  decay  of
mass [M] or is a decay of time [T] or of some combination of [M], [L], and [T],

7

the necessary agreements in Table 3 do not obtain.  This tends to confirm the conclusion
that the decays are decay of length, [L], only.

Some Major Cosmic Decays

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  decay  of  gravitation  is  a  major  contribution  to
accounting for the "missing mass" of the universe.  That is, greater gravitation in the past
helps  account  for  the  organization  that  the  universe  has  achieved,  a  role  for  which  the
"missing mass" has been hypothesized.  Furthermore, the on-going decay of gravitation
would indicate an ever-expanding future universe, not one that cycles through successive
expansions and contractions.

The next issue is to address the rate of decay, to evaluate the time constant,  τ.

That develops as follows.

We begin with the Planck length, lP 

, per equation 3, below, the value for which
is from "The 1986 Adjustment of the Fundamental Physical Constants"2.  (The factor of
2π stems from the use of "h-bar", Planck's constant divided by 2π, in the definition of
the  Planck  length.    As  will  be  seen,  that  rather  arbitrary  decision  creates  some  minor
confusion.)

and using that substitution equation 7 then becomes

This relationship yields two useful pieces of information.  First, the gravitational
inverse square law need not worry about the problem of zero separation distance, r = 0,
where an unacceptable infinity would occur.  And, second, the reason for the first is that
the maximum gravitational effect occurs when r = δ and there can be no smaller value
of  r.    That  is,  the  clear  implication  of  equation  9  is  that  at  radius  δ    there  is  a  total
change,  a  boundary.    The  inverse  square  relationship  is  relative  to  radius  δ  and  that
radius is the radius of a spherical core of the particle that is generating the gravitational
attraction, ag.  Such a spherical core of radius δ is the core of all particles, is the place
in which the supply of medium to be propagated resides.

The  "propagation  supply"  of  medium  within  a  particle  must  be  medium  at  an
enormously  higher  concentration  than  that  at  which  it  is  propagated  from  the  particle
because  the  propagation  has  been  going  on  for  billions  of  years  and  is  expected  to  so
continue.    Therefore,  within  whatever  distance  from  the  center  of  the  particle  that  the
"supply" region extends is a region of medium density immensely greater than that of the
medium propagated.  Its  outer boundary would be a sharp break in the smooth inverse
square variation outside of that region, where the propagation is.  Thus, if the "supply" of
medium  for  a  center  occupied  a  region  of  radius  other  than  δ  equation  9  would  not
obtain.

The  propagation  of  that  medium,  the  gradual  "leaking"  of  it  outward  from  the
core,  both  (a)  produces  the  effects  we  experience  as  electric  field,  magnetic  field  and
gravitational  field,  and  (b)  depletes  the  supply  of  medium  in  the  core  --  results  in  the
overall universal decay in the supply within each core and in the amplitude of each core's
propagated  medium  flow.    The  rate  of  that  "leakage",  that  propagation,  develops  as
follows.

A  process  which  the  core  decay  resembles  is  the  pumping  of  gas  out  of  a
chamber  to  create  a  vacuum.    In  that  case  the  "gas"  corresponds  to  the  medium,  the
chamber  to  the  core,  and  the  pumping  to  the  loss  of  medium  through,  the  surface
boundary of the core, to outward propagation.  The process of the pumping, whether of
gas out of a vacuum chamber or of medium out of the core is such that:

9

- The  rate  of  change  of  the  amount  of  gas  (medium)  remaining  in  the

chamber (core) and not yet pumped (propagated) is equal to:

· The density, amount  per  volume,  of the  gas  (medium)

to be pumped out times

· The  pumping  speed,  that  is  the  volume  per  time  at

which the pumping (propagation) occurs.

This is based on the conceptualization of the process as

· The  gas  (medium)  to  be  pumped  is  uniformly  distributed  within  the

chamber (core);

· a minute increment of volume is then pumped out at the pump during a
minute increment of time [a minute increment of gas (medium), equal
in amount to its density times the minute volume pumped, is removed];

· the  chamber  (core)  volume  remains  unchanged  but  it  now  contains
slightly  less  gas  (medium)  and  that  remaining,  unpumped,  part  of  the
substance  then  automatically,  naturally,  redistributes  itself  uniformly
within the chamber so that its density is reduced; and

· the cycle repeats over and over.

From this the rate of change of the amount of medium present within the core is

as follows.

The  pumping  takes  place  over  the  entire  surface  of  the  core  and  the  rate  at  which  the
outward flow takes place is the speed of medium travel, the speed of light, c.  (Both c
and  δ  are  functions  of  time,  also,  each  decaying.    However,  their  decay  rates  are
identical so that their ratio, as in equation 10, above, is constant.)

However,  while  this result  demonstrates the  exponential  decay  aspect  of  the  process,  it
makes no specification of what it is that occupies the volume and is decaying.  It merely
describes the evacuation of the volume as volume.

10

We  can  proceed  to  the  correct  description  of  the  decay  as  follows.    The  area
under the curve ε-t/τ  from t=0 to t=∞ is τ.  That is, the decaying process involves
over  the  total  time  span  the  same  amount  of  propagation  of  medium  as  if  the  initial,
undecayed rate of propagation went on, without decay, for time τ.  See Figure 1, below.
Therefore,  the  time  constant,  τ,  can  be  obtained  as  the  total  amount  remaining  to  be
propagated divided by the current rate of flow of the propagation.

The volumetric rate of  flow out of the core is

Figure 1

(13)  Rate of Flow = Pumping Speed =
         [Core Surface]·[Speed of Flow] = [4∙π∙δ2]·c
That  which  is  flowing,  the  gradual  propagation  outward  of  the  contents  of  the  core,  is
"medium"  the  effect  of  the  flow  of  which  is  that  which  we  call  electric  field,  the
summation  of  which  over  an  entire  surface  that  encloses  the  core  corresponds  to  the
enclosed electric charge (Stokes Theorem).

The amount of medium within the core, not yet pumped, at any moment is

(14)  Remaining Core Medium = h/c
which has the dimensions [M·L] and relative decay rate 1.  This develops as follows.

As  developed  in  equations  (1),  above,  the  mechanical  dimensions  of  charge
involve the quantity [M·L]½.  Such dimensions are unacceptable for a material reality in
that  conceptually  the  square  root  of  mass  or  of  length  has  no  practical,  no  material,
meaning.  Something that actually exists in the universe must have real dimensions as, for
example  the  dimensions  of  charge-times-charge  in  Coulomb's  Law  for  which  the
[M·L]½  becomes  [[M·L]½]2  =  M(cid:127)L .    This  problem  with  the  dimensions  of  charge
may  be  one  of  the  reasons  that  charge  has  always  been  dimensioned  in  terms  of  other
defined  dimensions  --  "coulomb"  traditionally  and  "ampere-second"  in  Standard
International (SI) units.

It is now time to adjust our conception of the Coulomb's Law  action.    Because
the law accurately gives the correct Coulomb effect results by multiplying the magnitude
of each of the two interacting charges we have naturally come to think that the physical
action is that way.  The reciprocity of the effect of each charge on the other has lead us to
assume that they physically interact in that way.  However, if the charge is to be real and
the  electric  field  is  to  support  its  potential  energy  role  neither  can  have  dimensions
involving [M·L]½.  Rather, in terms of the mechanics of the physical action, the charge,
the  field  and  the  flowing  medium  must  correspond  to  the  charge-squared  dimensions
[M·L].

11

The action is not the traveling of the effect of the source charge's qs (the effect
2 (of flowing [what
of the source core's flowing [source medium]) but rather of its qs
we  have  been  calling  source  medium]2)  from  the  source  to  an  encountered
charge.  At the encountered charge the extent to which the flow arriving from the source
charge acts on the encountered charge  is  moderated  by,  according  to,  the  magnitude  of
2,  its  own  medium-filled  core  and
the  encountered  charge's  own  charge  squared,  qe
outward flowing medium propagation.

This  discussion  is  related  in  our  minds  to  thinking  of  the  medium,  both  that
within  the  core  and  that  which  is  being  propagated,  as  the  relatively  "hard"  tangible
substance involved with its related energy as an intangible "thing", there because of the
medium  and  only  perceived  when  and  because  of  a  tangible  energy-involved  action
taking  place.    Yet,  the  medium  corresponds  only  to  the  effects  which  we  think  of  as
electric field and charge, effects no more tangible than energy, and perhaps less so.  It is
just as reasonable to think of the core as filled with and propagating some form of energy
as to think of it in terms of medium or charge.

Thus  the  description  of  the  medium  supply  in  the  core  can  also  be  an  energy-
2} = [M∙L].  The
related expression that has the same dimensions as qs
quantity h/c meets those requirements and is the most fundamental quantity to do so as
in the "fine structure constant".

The exponential decay time constant as given by equation 14 divided by equation

13 is as follows;

        = 3.57532·1017 s 3
        ≅ 11.3373·109 years

however,  the  dimensions  of  the  numerator  of  equation  16  are [M∙L] and  those  of  the
denominator  are [L3/T] so  that  the  quotient  dimension  should  not  be  simply [T].
The solution to that dilemma is as follows.

The content of the core flows outward at a volumetric flow rate, the denominator
of  equation  16.    Although  the  decaying  exponential  process  goes  on  forever,  the  total
amount of such flow is a finite quantity, the area under the decaying exponential curve
per  Figure  1.    That  area  also  corresponds  to,  then,  a  finite  volume  (produced  by  the
medium outflow).  The total magnitude of that area under the curve, that finite  volume
propagated during the decay's process from time t = 0 to time t = ∞, is the same as the
original amount available to so propagate, the numerator of equation 16, the original core
medium content.  Then the equation 16 numerator, h/c, is also an ultimate volume of
dimensions [L3], which results in a quotient dimension for τ of [T].

Therefore,  among  a  large  number  of  other  quantities,  the  acceleration  due  to
gravitation and the speed of light are decaying exponentially as in equations 17 and 18,
below.
(17)  a(t)g,decay = ag,newton·ε-t/τ
(18)  c(t) = C0·ε-t/τ
where:

ag,newton is the gravitational acceleration
         per Newton's Law of Gravitation,
C0 is the speed of light at t = 0, and
τ = 3.57532·1017 s  [equation 16].

The bearing of all of this on the behavior of the Pioneer 10 and 11 satellites is as
follows.    The  Newtonian  solar  gravitational  acceleration,  ag,newton  ,  of  the  satellites
varies  with satellite  distance  from  the  Sun, and  that  has  been  taken  into  account  in  the
satellite path calculations.  However, the actual solar gravitational acceleration involved
is the Newtonian amount exponentially decaying per equation 17.

During  the  time  period  from  the  start  of  the  satellite  path  observations  to  the
 has decreased less (because its decrease is  due  solely  to  radial
present time  ag,newton 
 (the decrease in which is due to decay in addition
distance increase) than has ag,decay 
to radial distance increase).  But, NASA has not known about decay and has calculated
satellite motion without taking decay into account.  Not knowing about the decay, NASA
is always calculating and measuring in terms of the at that moment current decayed state,
which NASA thinks is a steady, unchanging, undecayed state whereas in fact earlier, less
decayed increments of solar gravitational acceleration were larger than current ones.

But,  NASA  cannot  avoid  the  actual  effect  of  earlier,  less  decayed,  solar
gravitation  even  if  it  does  not  know  about  it.    Calculating  in  terms  of  the  present,
measuring  in  terms  of  the  present,  NASA  gets  results  due  to  (unknown  of)  earlier  less
decayed, greater ag that NASA can only end up interpreting as an anomalous sunward
acceleration relative to the only ag 

 that NASA knows ag,newton .

  

However, NASA does not and cannot measure the location of the satellites to the
precision needed to disclose that effect.  What NASA has done with sufficient precision
is  measure  the  Doppler shift in transmissions received  from  the  satellites.   That  data  is
sufficient for the calculation of velocity at a particular time, and a stream of velocity data
is sufficient for the calculation of acceleration.

 

But,  the  electromagnetic  wave  propagation  that  carries  the  Doppler  shift  data
from  the  satellites  is  also  subject  to  the  general  universe  decay.    Just  as  the  universal
  produces  red  shifts  in  the  light  propagated  from  astronomical  sources,  it
decay  of  c
produces  modification  of  the  Doppler  frequency  shifts  otherwise  produced  solely  by
satellite  velocity.    Satellite  velocity  away  from  us  produces  Doppler  reduction  of
frequency  in  satellite  transmissions  received  by  NASA.    But,  those  transmissions,
initiated  and  traveling  at  an  earlier,  less  decayed,  faster  speed,  c, 
  result  in  a  decay-
caused frequency increase that can only appear to NASA observers as a smaller Doppler
frequency reduction, a smaller satellite velocity than would have been the case in the (as
NASA understands it) absence of universal decay.

(All of the data received by transmission from the satellites must be adjusted for
the  relative  positions  of  the  Earth  and  the  satellite  and  for  the  motion  of  each.    The
performing of those adjustments by NASA for the non-decay  case  (as they  know  of  it)
also corrects the decay modifications contained in the data (even though NASA does not
know it is doing that.)

13

The  decay-produced  frequency  shift  corresponds  directly  to  the  speed  of  light
 decay, which is equal to the satellite velocity change that would be
variation due to c
needed  to  produce  the  same  observed  data.    Therefore  the  satellite  velocity  deviations
from  NASA's  expected  values,  which  deviations  yield  the  anomalous  acceleration,  and
which  are  due  to  gravitation  decay,  are reported  to  NASA  by  the  satellites  as  speed  of
light deviations received by NASA as smaller Doppler shift than otherwise.

 

Both c - decay and  ag - decay have the same time constant,  τ.  The  c - decay

data unknowingly received by NASA is as follows.
(19)  c(t) = C0·ε-t/τ
      dc(t)   C0·ε-t/τ
            ───── = ────────
       dt        τ

Because  τ  >  1017  s  (≅  1010  years)  the  rate  of  change  in  c  appears  to  us  as
constant over the span of much less than 100 years that the satellites have been being
observed.  Therefore,
(20)  dc(t)   Co    c    [c is our contemporary c
            ───── = ─── = ───

            = 8.38505·10-8 cm/s2
            = ap, the Pioneer anomalous acceleration
which  compares  to  the  8.5·10-8  cm/s2  observed  by  NASA  and  reported  in  1998.
Several  alternative  values  scattered  over  the  range  7.29  to  8.77·10-8  have  since
been reported.1

In the process of seeking explanation of the anomalous acceleration NASA  has
investigated and reported on a number of candidate effects.  In general these have fallen
into one or more of the following categories.

a. Effect does not actually occur.

b. Effect is too small to account for the anomalous acceleration.

c. Effect acts in the opposite direction to that of the anomalous acceleration.
For example, "... solar radiation pressure decreases as r-2 ... at distances > 10 - 15 AU
it produces an acceleration that is much less than 8·10-8 cm/s2, directed away from
the Sun.  (The solar wind is roughly a factor of 100 smaller than this.)"1

Other effects reported on include:

- precessional attitude control maneuvers,

- non-isotropic thermal radiation from the satellites,

- the radiation of the Pioneer radio beam,

- error in the computer programs used to perform the calculations,

- hardware problems,

- unknown internal systemic properties,

14

-some unknown viscous drag,

and  others.    All  of  these  effects  fall  far  from  explaining  the  anomalous  acceleration.
However, such an extensive family of small effects and unknown behaviors might well
account for the decay-explained acceleration not exactly matching the observed amounts.

A more clear comparison of data and decay-prediction occurs as follows.  From

the original (1998) paper reporting the anomalous acceleration:1

"The CHASMP [The Aerospace Corporation's Compact High Accuracy
Satellite  Motion  Program]  analysis  of  Pioneer  10  data  showed  ...
[without  using  the  apparent  acceleration]  a  steady  frequency  drift  of
about -6·10-9 Hz/s. ...  This equates to a clock acceleration, -at, of
-2.8·10-18 s/s2."

The effective appearance of a clock [T] acceleration (instead of a length [L] decay)
was produced by calculations in which the anomalous acceleration was denied forcing a
compensating  clock  acceleration.    The  clock  acceleration  that  would  produce  the
corresponding  effect  to  the  actual  effect  of  a  length  decay  would  be  a  rate  of  1/τ  as
follows.
(21)       1        1
      at = ─ = ─────────────
           τ    3.57532·1017
         = 2.79695·10-18 s/s2
           calculated from universal decay, compared to
         = 2.8·10-18 s/s2
           calculated from Pioneer data using "CHASMP"

The identity of clock acceleration with Pioneer acceleration is1

(22)  aP ≡ at·c
         = 8.38505·10-8 cm/s2
as in equation 20.

The above agreement in at, the near agreement with somewhat scattered data in
ap, and the number and variety of NASA reported secondary effects that can account for
the  ap  agreement  being  less  precise  than  the  at,  would  all  tend  to  indicate  that  the
universal  decay,  predicted  in  publication  in  1997  4  (and  in  research  much  earlier)
substantially  before  the  reporting  of  the  "anomalous  acceleration"1,  is  fact  as  presented
and accounts for the pioneer 10 and 11 "anomalous acceleration".

Abstract

A family of relativistic geometric models is deﬁned as a general-
ization of the actual anti-de Sitter (1+1) model of the relativistic har-
monic oscillator. It is shown that all these models lead to the usual
harmonic oscillator in the non-relativistic limit, even though their rel-
ativistic behavior is quite diﬀerent. Among quantum models we ﬁnd
a set of models with countable energy spectra, and another one hav-
ing only a ﬁnite number of energy levels and in addition a continuous
spectrum.

The problem of the relativistic generalization of the (classical or quantum)
non-relativistic harmonic oscillator (NRHO) has been frequently discussed,
but as yet there is no unique deﬁnition of the relativistic harmonic oscilla-
tor (RHO). In the context of general relativity, the RHO has been deﬁned
as a free system on the anti-de Sitter (AdS) static background. There are
many phenomenologic [1, 2] and group theoretic [3, 4, 5] arguments for this
geometric model. Its advantage is that the constants of the classical motion
(on geodesics) satisfy the so(1, 2) algebra (of the AdS symmetry [3]), realized
by Poison brackets for any AdS metric. However, the concrete choice of the
metric is also important from the observer’s point of view because the form
of the classical trajectory, as well as the modes of the corresponding quantum

system, depend on it. For the (1+1) RHO the (1+3) metric proposed in Ref.
[2] gives the following (1+1) AdS metric

ds2 =

which reproduces the classical non-relativistic equation of motion, i.e. ¨x +
ω2x = 0. The corresponding quantum system has been analyzed in Ref. [6],
starting with another AdS metric which can be derived from (1) by changing
x′ = x/√1 + ω2x2. The result is an equidistant
the space coordinate x
energy spectrum with a groundstate energy larger than, but approaching ω/2
in the non-relativistic limit (in natural units, ¯h = c = 1). Since, partularlly,
the space coordinate transformations of the static backgrounds do not change
the quantum modes, we can say that the RHO is well simulated by the free
motion on the AdS background with the metric (1).

However, one can ask if there are more geometric models which should
behave as the NRHO in the non-relativistic limit. In order to give an answer,
we shall study here the family of models having the metrics

ds2 = g00dt2 + g11dx2 =

1 + (1 + λ)ω2x2
1 + λω2x2

dt2

−

1 + (1 + λ)ω2x2
(1 + λω2x2)2 dx2,

(2)

where λ is a real parameter. Our aim is to investigate both the classical and
the quantum free motions of a particle of mass m, and to show that all these
models lead to the NRHO in the non-relativistic limit. Moreover, we shall
try to point out their speciﬁc relativistic eﬀects.

The metrics (2) represent a generalization of the AdS metric (1). In fact
these are conformal transformations depending on λ of some AdS metrics if
λ < 0, of some static de Sitter metrics if λ > 0, or of the the Minkowski
ﬂat metric when λ = 0. The parameterization of these transformations has
been deﬁned in a such a manner to obtain the exact AdS metric (1) for
1. We note that the event horizon of an observer situated at x = 0 is
λ =
−
at R+ =
λ in the case of λ < 0 in which
the metrics have singularities. This will give the space domain of the free
motion, D = (

property remains valid also for the quantum motion.

The quantum free motion of a spinless particle is described by the scalar
ﬁeld φ deﬁned on D minimally coupled with the gravitational ﬁeld [7] given
by the metric (2). Because of energy conservation, the Klein-Gordon equation

In the case of λ < 0 the domain D = (

R−, R−) is ﬁnite (as in Ref. [2])
and, therefore, the polynomial solutions (23) will be square integrable over
D only if p = p+. We observe that there are no restrictions on the range of n
and, consequently, the discrete spectrum will be countable. Moreover, in this
case we have no continuous spectrum since the hypergeometric functions (20)
generally diverge for y
R−). We note that for the AdS metric
1) we obtain the same result as in Ref. [6], namely En = ω(2p+ + n).
(λ =
Thus we have solved the quantum problem for all the values of the pa-
rameter λ. Herein it is interesting to observe that our results are continuous
in λ. More precisely, in the limit of λ
0 the general formulae (24) and (23)

will give the energy spectrum (15) and the NRHO wave functions. Indeed,
m/2λω (since we have choose p = p− < 0
we observe that, in this limit, p
for λ > 0 and p = p+ > 0 for λ < 0) and nmax ∼
. Therefore,
the ﬁnite discrete spectra of the models with λ > 0 become countable while
the continuous spectra disappear. Hence, it is obvious that all the discrete
spectra given by (24) go to (15) when λ
0. Furthermore, we can calculate,
up to factors, the limit of the wave functions (23). We obtain

where Hn are Hermite polynomials and n = 2(n′ + s) as deﬁned above.
Thus it results that all the functions (23) go to the speciﬁc NRHO wave
function which are just the wave functions for λ = 0. For this reason the
hypergeometric functions of (23) with the factors x2s could be considered as
a generalization of the Hermite polynomials.

The non-relativistic limit of our models, deﬁned by m/ω

, can be
easily calculated starting with the observation that, according to (16) and
(21), this is equivalent with the limit λ
ω. Hence,
the non-relativistic limit of a model with any λ will be the same as in the case
of λ = 0, i.e. the NRHO. Therefore, we can conclude that all the models of
RHO we have studied here have the same non-relativistic limit, even though
they are in fact very diﬀerent.

Finally we must specify that among these models only one has the whole
i. the
properties of the NRHO. This is that of the AdS metric for which:
classical motion is oscillatory with a ﬁxed frequency (independent on E), and,
ii. the quantum energy spectrum is equidistant. Another interesting model
is that of λ = 0 because its wave functions coincide with those of NRHO.
However, in general, the models with λ
1 can not be considered as pure
harmonic oscillators since these have not the above mentioned properties of
the AdS model. On the other hand, the new models we have considered are
interesting because their speciﬁc countable or ﬁnite discrete energy spectra
could allow to identify new observable relativistic eﬀects.

Quantum Mechanics of photons leads to a theory of Quantum Gravity 
that nicely matches the experimental results of varying fine structure 
constant, obtained from many-multiplet Quaser absorption systems and 
atomic clocks. The variation of that constant is due to quantum gravity of 
photons, created by their non-zero invariant mass. The photon mass is 
obtained from a Klein-Gordon scalar tachyon. This led to a Lorentz 
symmetry-breaking and varying speed of light theory in complex 
spacetime manifold. In essence, Quantum Mechanics includes quantum 
gravitational potential in the guise of Quantum potential. The greatest 
surprise lies in showing that Quantum Mechanics naturally leads to open 
bosonic string whose troublesome tachyonic vibration is taken in its 
stride. Quantum Mechanics also proves Sen`s second conjecture and 
space-tearing. Length melts into dimensionless number at the Planck 
scale. Quantum-mechanical analog of the classical equation E=Mc 2 has 
been derived and a dispersion relation demonstrates Lorentz non-
invariance in Quantum Mechanics.

1. INTRODUCTION 

        Theory of Quantum Gravity is perhaps the greatest intellectual challenge 
to physicists today. Although the three interactions in nature --- 
electromagnetic, weak and strong --- have been successfully described by 
Quantum Field Theories (that constitute the Standard Model), gravity has 
persistently resisted unification with Quantum theory. There are several distinct 
paths along which attempts have been made in the past [1], but the following 
two theories have emerged with a sustained growth and internal consistency; 
and their recent results have far-reaching consequences in the understanding 
of our physical world: 

      

(1) Loop Quantum Gravity [2,3,4,5,6,7] 
(2) String, Superstring, M-theory [8,9,10,11] 

It is a real conundrum why gravity cannot be united with Quantum Mechanics. 
When Quantum Gravity is teased out of Quantum Mechanics in a deceptively 
simple way, its mathematics spontaneously leads to the theory of open strings 
[12] and also tachyon condensation [13], when photon dynamics is considered. 
It is really happenstance that quantum gravity has found its experimental 
verification in the recent diverse experiments aimed at finding variations of fine 
structure constant over different look-back times [14,15,16].The first hint of a 
varying fine structure constant surfaced in string theory. Since then there has 
been a surge of interest in finding observational and theoretical results in 
support of a varying α. In 1999, J.K.Webb et al [14] declared results showing a 
time-varying α. Peres [17] suggested that the variation in α is due to a varying 
speed of light (VSL). The controversy regarding the effect of a varying 
dimensionful quantity on a dimensionless constant has been discussed below, 
and a solution to this end  emerged when one could identify quantum 
spacetime with complex spacetime manifold. The main purpose of this paper is 
to show that our theoretical predictions from the quantum gravity of photons 
agree quite nicely with the accumulated experimental results of a time-varying 
α. The other aim is to access string theory through Quantum Mechanics. 
                             Various theories have been advanced to interpret a varying α 
over cosmological times [18,19,20,21,22]. A varying α creates many troubles 
in present-day physics ---- chief among these being a contradiction of the 
Standard Model of particle physics. It however more than compensates for this 
by yielding a theory of quantum gravity of photons, nicely verified by the extant 
experimental results provided by many-multiplet  quaser  absorption systems, 
Gamma Ray Bursts(GRB) and transitions between two nearly degenerate 
states of atomic clock [14,15,16,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]. 
                             Another striking result is obtained from this quantum gravity 
theory in a form of mathematical gift : Quantum Mechanics,if probed deeply, 
leads to open string theory [12]. A three-dimensional vibration also requires the 
use of quaternions in Quantum theory [35,36].

                           The organization of the paper is as follows : In section 2, I derive the 
photon wave function by quantizing the classical energy equation of special relativity, 
and then refute all objections to a photon wave function. The momentum operator is 
found invertible and the eigenvalue of this inverse operator is just the reciprocal of 
eigenvalue of the operator. In section 3, I derive another wave function, but this time it is

motivated by a purely mathematical reasoning : The derivatives 

d
φ1  and 
dx

necessarily be constants; they might be functions of x and t  respectively. This yields a 
space- and time-varying speed of light in complex spacetime manifold. The controversy 
regarding the validity of  VSL theories, in the context of a varying dimensionless number 
α, loses strength once it is realized that real-valued meter rods and real time-ticking 
clocks are of no use in measuring a complex-valued speed of photon traveling in 
complex spacetime. The varying speed of light extracted in real spacetime is found 
greater than the speed of light in vacuum,  c0 . This immediately made us consider 
tachyons --- the dreaded objects with imaginary mass, and not detected to date. But I 
have made a significant change in their property : Their imaginary energy and 
momentum are retained. These are not new concepts in Quantum Mechanics 
embedded in complex spacetime (see Ref [37] for details). Tachyon mass is kept real. A 
tachyon cannot be found in complex spacetime because the latter is operationally 
inaccessible. It cannot be found at a measurement event [37] since it pops up as a 
photon there. While discussing these I have deduced an explicit expression for the 
relativistic mass operator  $ ( )
                              Next I turned to the problem of finding the least possible invariant  
mass of a tachyon in section 4.To this end, an ansatz is inserted into Klein-Gordon 
equation to obtain a four-component wave function. Arguments have been advanced to 
take away the sting of all the objections to its use as a valid wave function. The non-zero  
mass of photon (or, its complex spacetime masquerader, tachyon) has been found to be 
1.7 × −10 38 gm  which is exceptionally close to values obtained in GRB events. The 
quantum-mechanical analog of the classical relation  E Mc

                               From the varying speed of light I derive the the most important

where the look-back time is  t  and the constant  λ was later found to be proportional to

Planck scale.

                              Section 6 describes the Quantum Gravity theory of photons derived 
from quantum potential that introduces slowing down of older photons. The key 
ingredient in quantum gravity of photons is their non-zero invariant mass revealed by the 
theory. An important finding is that the Schwarzschild radius for photon is equal to  lp
There is indication in the theory that  

′α of string theory is also equal to  lp

2 . As a 

2 . 

refinement of Heisenberg`s position-momentum uncertainty relation we prove a theorem 
stating that a particle cannot have a definite position; nor it can have a definite 
momentum. Complete uncertainty ! The theorem in general states that an incompatible 
observable cannot have a definite value.This introduces a formidable tool in quantum 
physics : It immediately removes big bang singularity of Quantum Cosmology, 
singularities owing to notorious zero-distance interactions in QED, and  Schwarzschild  
black-hole singularity. 
                                         I derive tachyon wave function in this section. The half wave 
number along the imaginary axis drove us to the idea that a single vertical wave is 
confined in an inaccessible region of Planck length. This oscillation is traveling with a 
velocity c(x,t) along the real x-axis. This describes an open string whose lowest 
excitation produces tachyons. I have shown that tachyons in complex space-time show 
up as photons at the measurement point. This is equivalent to tachyon condensation 
[38,39] which carries the tachyon to a stable state, viz., photon at the measurement 
point (MP). 
                                        In the same section we discuss the possible Lorentz non-
invariance owing to non-zero invariant mass of photon. While the (classical) theory of 
special relativity does not admit a preferred reference frame, the measurement problem 
of Quantum Mechanics[40] poses the problem of preferred basis[41] which can be 
resolved only by stating that the preferred reference frame(the frame containing the 
device particle at the MP as the origin) is chosen by the observer or measuring 
device[37].This is also supported by Copenhagen Interpretation[40]. Quantum 
Mechanics requires ten-dimensional spacetime manifold [37] to describe a quantum 
system. Of these, five are imaginary dimensions which are obviously compactified since 
measurements always take place at real spacetime.The negative norm states of string 
theory are no longer disastrous as Quantum Mechanics permits negative probability[37]. 
String theory is therefore on the right track ! 
                                        Finally, section 6 compares the predictions of our quantum 
gravity theory of photons with the experimental results gleaned from observational data 

of recent years showing the persistent variations 

 and

quaser and atomic clock experiments. The theory is in good agreement with the 
experimental results. This perhaps fulfils a hope that a quantum gravity theory has been 
experimentally confirmed. The experimental results have been provided with a 
consistent theoretical underpinning that stems from Quantum Mechanics. 
 
2. PHOTON  WAVE  FUNCTION

There are clear-cut objections to a photon wave function [42A,43,44]. I shall discuss 
them only after deriving the wave function. The energy equation of special theory of 
relativity is

The concept of wave function of photon  is not new, but it has only found reference 
within the description of second quantization with creation and annihilation operators 
[42]. For the wave function of photon, we assume the splitting: 
 
                                                   ψ
 
Since ψ( , )x t
will be real. In general, both will be complex. Therefore,

The definitions of wave number κ and  ω imply  
 

 Consequently, the ansatz for photon wave function is

The fact that a photon is quantum-mechanically a probability wave (as the above 
equation says) rules out the objections to a photon wave function[42A,43,44]. While a 
conventional wave function of photon, e.g. Landau-Peierls function[45], consider it as 
having electromagnetic origin, we here explore only the ontological basis of a photon 
through its probabilistic origin. While photons are quanta of electromagnetic field, they 
are also quanta of probability field  P(s) ,described by Eq.(18). This equation also 
supports the observation of  I.Biyalinicki-Birula [46] that photo-detection probability falls 
off exponentially. 
               There are mainly two objections to photon wave function : 
                                               (i) No position operator exists for photon,                                

  for   s ≥ 0 .                                           (18)

                                            (ii) While the position space wave function may be localized                   
near a space-time point, the measurable quantities, like                     
the electromagnetic field vectors, energy and photo-                           
detection probability remain spread out.  

To refute the objections, I first derive the photon wave function. Eq.(7) implies

where I have ignored the arbitrary constants of integration. Making use of these and 
Eqs.(3),(17) and (19) the photon wave functions in the two domains take the following 
forms :

so in the measurement event at spacetime point (x = ct, t) the probability density is

while its eigenvalue at that time is simply  ct0 .The eigenvalue is real. This sets apart 
photons from all other particles in Quantum Mechanics. While I have shown elsewhere 
[37] that all quantum systems travel in complex spacetime except at the measurement 
event, photons always move in real spacetime.This might provide a reason why photons 
have the maximum permissible speed in real-dimensional nature! 
                                      The other objection to a photon wave function may be refuted in 
quantum-mechanical terms. It is reiterated that the photon wave function derived here 
has no relation whatsoever with the wave function derived from electromagnetic inputs. 
Here, the photon is a probability wave ------ a generic mathematical wave in probability 
space. Indeed all quantum systems are probability waves [37] when left to evolve i.e. 
when they are not subjected to measurements. The probability fields of different 
quantum particles do not interact among themselves because these are mathematical 
(probability) fields. The observables of a photon may be calculated using the appropriate 
operators on the photon wave functions, Eqs.(20) and (21). Of course, the 
corresponding eigenvalues (except position) may be complex. This only shows that the 
corresponding operators are non-Hermitian normal operators which transform into 
Hermitian ones at the MP [37]. At the MP the measurement device will record real 
numbers ---- so there is no problem. Let us see that it is really so. In general , when the 
photon is not at the MP, i.e.,  x

This reveals the transformation of non-Hermitian operators into Hermitian ones at the 
MP. The complex eigenenergies need not be cofused with those characteristic of decay 
or growing  Gamow vectors. These are mere consequences of the complex spacetime 
manifold in which the quantum particles live.

κ( )x is  positive as the photon is traveling along the +x  direction. Now a look at a 

similar photon wave function of constant speed, viz. Eq.(20) for  x
 suggests that  b  
in the exponent of  Eq. (32) must be negative in order to check the diverging P(x ,t). We 
set   b
inhomogeneous wave traveling with a varying speed c(x ,t ) along +x  direction. The 
photon wave function may now be written down from Eq. (31b): 

′b  is positive. Eq. (32) then describes probability density as an

 Varying speed of light (VSL) theories [47,48,49,50,51] have always received fatal 
blows while trying to interpret the varying fine structure constant results. While 
interpreting the varying fine structure constant results the lethal line is that all 
lengths, masses and times are measured in dimensionless numbers (multiples) of 
unit length, mass and time. A change in a dimensionful quantity cannot rule out the 
possibility that the meter rods ,clocks etc have undergone similar changes in lengths 
ticks etc. No experiment can distinguish ! Therefore change in a dimensionful 
quantity does not point towards a change in a dimensionless quantity like α. 

 

17

                            But all these arguments hold only when we measure something like 
speed of light with `meter` of a meter ruler and `second` of a clock, which are all real 
numbers.That is , the measurements involve four-dimensional real spacetime. But 
here, we find that something extraordinary happens. From Eq. (34A), the varying 
speed of light is

where we have used Eqs.(33) and (34). This speed c(x ,t ) is a compex quantity, and 
so it cannot be measured by real meters and seconds. In fact these speed is not 
measurable. Whenever we measure speed of light this space-time varying complex 
, which is the present 
speed transforms into a real valued constant speed    c
speed of light in vacuum. To prove how this measured value of a complex  c(x ,t ) 
transforms into a real c(0,0) we recall that the criterion of measurement is spelt out 
as 
                                            x

                                                           (36c)

Differential of the second equation gives    c t dt

and  t0 . Now we use the relation ω

If we set the present time as t = 0 =  t0 , then  Eq.(36d)  gives x = 0. Hence from

Eq.(36e)  the speed of light at the MP is   c
.                              Gravitational redshift of light  rising away from a distant quaser is 
caused by a decrease in frequency :

Since the above equation and Eq.(36A) are similar in all respects we shall drop  λ0  
and T in future discussion, and instead continue to use λ and t and Eq.(36A). 
                                       I have thus proved that  c ( x t ) >  c0 , an astonishing result 
that says, older photons had higher speed than  c0 . Special theory of relativity 
categorically says those older particles were  certainly not photons. But tachyons 
[52,53] may be suitable candidates satisfying this faster-than-light speed. Note that

and this implies an energy-dependence of speed of light; quantum gravity models 
suggest just this [54,55]. 
                                A few difficulties are now to be resolved once I propose 
tachyons[56]. An infinite amount of energy is required to slow a tachyon down to  the 
speed of light. But theory requiring this is the classical special relativity. In Quantum 
theory I have proved through Eqs. (36c),(36d) and (36e) how  c ( x t ) , a higher 
speed, transforms into the lower speed  c0  at the MP.  
                                The violation of causality by tachyons never takes place because 
emission of a tachyon  at a measurement event E and its absorption at event E’ 
actually involve photons, not tachyons. This is due to the fact that tachyons show up 
as photons at the measurement events. This is possible because the least possible 
speed of tachyon is speed of light. The events E and E’ involve photons ,so causality 
is not  flouted. As tachyons move in complex spacetime they will forever remain 
unobservable. The 26-dimensional string theory requires tachyons.The pernicious 
negative norm states are however no longer dreaded objects as the latter have been 
shown to be  perfectly compatible with Quantum Mechanics [37]. Superstring theory 
has replaced bosonic string theory because the latter suffered from tachyonic

instability. But it will become clear later that tachyons in complex spacetime having

are imaginary quantities.This is not anarchy ---- as tachyons move exclusively in 
complex spacetime and never show up at real spacetime. I do not attribute the 
peculiar tachyon properties in the  conventional way: assigning imaginary invariant 
mass to tachyons. Rather I keep tachyon mass real while  E  and  p  are imaginary 
even in the classical domain, as tachyons have never been detected at classical 
spacetime points at a measurement event.

Tachyon is a massive particle and its invariant mass is m. It is quite natural now to 
find the least possible mass allowed in Quantum Mechanics  in order to fit the roles 
of both photons and tachyons. Photons in classical special relativity are massless 
but their quantum-mechanical counterparts in complex spacetime (tachyons) are 
massive. Since tachyons appear as photons at the MP, photons are massive too, 
since mass cannot simply be wished away. I now explore Klein-Gordon equation for 
this least mass of scalar tachyons, and on the way try to refute the objections that 
have made its use questionable time and again as a single-particle equation.

unphysical states at the classical spacetime point, the difficulty simply disappears.

When the Klein-Gordon particle is  at rest, p = 0 and v = 0. Eq.(56) now becomes

The lower bound for E for this free particle is zero. In such a case, Eq.(57) yields the 
least possible quantum-mechanical mass :

I assign this least mass to the tachyon concerned ,which hands over this mass to 
photon at the measurement event. This value of photon invariant mass is 
exceptionally close to those obtained in Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) events [77,78]

This non-zero photon rest mass would bring in trouble for Quantum Electrodynamics 
through loss of gauge invariance, making it non-renormalizable. Also, charge 
conservation would not be absolutely guaranteed. But all these should not

The correction term in Eq. (58) is due to quantum potential ( or, as will become clear 
later,due to quantum gravitational potential arising out of particle mass). Eq. (58) 
may be tested experimentally to check its validity.

(0,0). Generally, quantum measurement takes place at a single spatial point, say,  x0 . 
Therefore, α is instead measured at  spacetime points   x0 0,

is the quantum potential (of photon). Bohm`s  priceless contribution to Quantum 
Mechanics is perhaps the concept of  quantum potential [38,39,40,41,42]. The 
quantum potential would generate a quantum force

which has not been shown to be the fifth interaction in nature. But there is one 
possibility. Quantum Mechanics has successfully incorporated the 
electromagnetic, weak and strong forces into a successful model ----- the 
Standard model. But it could not do so with gravity. Since quantum force did not 
emerge as a separate interaction in the Standard model, could it be that gravity is 
already included in Quantum theory in the guise of quantum potential? There is a 
similar happening in string theory. In the quantum theory of strings, graviton 
appears in a natural way in the spectrum of closed strings. One more thing 
motivates : The constant  λ in the varying speed  c(x ,t) is actually proportional to 
the Planck length, as will be shown below. This is an element of quantum gravity, 
that has played a central role in our theory. I, therefore label  quantum potential  
VQ as quantum gravitational potential  VG  of photon.

                         I now calculate the gravitational potential energy of a photon  
owing to back-reaction of its own gravitational field. If the photon is assumed to 
be a point particle, the calculated energy diverges owing to singularity at the 
origin.But this type of singularity that plagued QED is created by a belief of the 
existence of zero-distance. Thanks to the following theorem, zero-distance is 
quantum-mechanically forbidden by Heisenberg uncertainty relation. 
  
 Theorem:  Position of a quantum system cannot be measured with arbitrary precision. 
 
Proof:  Let us consider a quantum system having a definite or precise position  x . 
            Then its uncertainty in position  ∆x = 0 . Inserting this value in position-
momentum uncertainty relation 
 
                                                      ∆ ∆x px ≥ h
2
 
  one obtains                                       h ≤ 0 , 
  since division by zero is not a mathematically permissible operation. Therefore,   
∆x ≠ 0.  In other words, position of a quantum system cannot be measured with  
arbitrary precision. <  
The same conclusion holds for its momentum. <  
  
  A quantum system cannot have a position at the origin ,i.e ,   x = 0,   because 
then its position uncertainty  ∆x = 0 , which is not allowed according to the above 
theorem. Similarly, x = y = z = 0 ,and hence, zero volume are simply  quantum-
mechanically forbidden. Big bang singularity, owing to zero volume, is thus 
removed in Quantum Cosmology [37]. Since

implies x = y = z =0, the spacetime singularity at the center  r = 0  of a 
Schwarzschild black hole is readily removed by Quantum Mechanics. The 
divergences occurring in Quantum Field Theory due to zero-distance interactions 
may be cured similarly. Like string theory (where strings collide over a non-zero 
distance), particles interact over a non-zero finite distance. 
                             To determine the minimum distance between the field point (or 
MP) and the center of mass of a photon, note that the reference frame at the field 
point is generally at rest, i.e., stationary. But this scenario changes once the field 
point   x Rs<
frames are available inside that radius. Hence the minimum approachable

                                    A few remarks about  VQ  of Eq.(83). Quantum potential has 
often been identified as an intrinsic self-energy of the quantum system [81]. R. 
Carroll [82] has shown that geometric properties of space ,affected by the 
presence of a particle,is manifested as quantum force (via quantum

it can attract objects gravitationally. This effect is obviously small. But it has 
recently been detected in a series of experiments showing a time-varying fine 
structure constant. I shall shortly prove that  λ is proportional to Planck length. 
Photon mass curves space, which in turn induces a space-time varying input in 
an otherwise constant speed of photon. The force at play is quantum gravity of 
photons ------ or, stated more transparently, ----- quantum self-gravity of photons. 
It is quite natural  to identify the quantum potential  VQ  of a photon with the 
quantum gravity energy  VG , otherwise quantum force [83,84] stemming from 
quantum potential would admit the existence of an extra interaction other than the 
four fundamental interactions of nature. Conventional Quantum Mechanics with 
no explicit use of quantum potential, thus automatically excludes quantum gravity 
potential from the very beginning ! We need not add gravity to Quantum 
Mechanics. Gravity is included in Quantum Mechanics ! One cannot overlook the 
parallels between Quantum theory and string theory in this particular aspect. As 
Brian Greene[85] has said,`` String theory ……… is a quantum theory that includes 
gravity as well.`` Indeed  Scherk and Schwarz [86] long ago found that string 
theory naturally includes gravitons as additional messenger-like particles in string 
vibrations. 
                                  Quantum potential has been shown to produce a local 
curvature of   P x t
VG . Therefore, from Eqs.(83) and (86A) 
 

( , )  [87,88]. We thus have enough reason to equate VQ  with

Eqs.(87) and (89)  are puzzling in the sense that a  real length is equated to an 
imaginary quantity. It was known long before that something peculiar happens at 
Planck scale. Since we are on the limit of least possible distance,to quote Edward 
Witten, ``space will re-expand in another `direction` peculiar to string 
theory.``[70]. Eq.(89) simply states that Planck unit of length is proportional to 
one unit of length along the imaginary spatial axis. It is known that inside the 
Schwarzschild radius (equal to Planck length squared), proper radial distances 
and proper times are imaginary. 
                                   We have already found that the wave number 
corresponding to minimum momentum is (1/2) along the imaginary spatial axis. 
The Figs.(3) and (4) clearly show an open string in its least excitation mode.The 
vibration is confined within the distance  lp ----- the minimum distance along the 
real line [90].Fig.(4) shows this open string whose open ends travel with velocity 
c0 . The replacement of point particles of Quantum Mechanics with strings 
resolves the incompatibility between Quantum Mechanics and General 
relativity.Quantum Mechanics thus leads to string theory via Eq.(88).  
                                      A  remark about Eq.(88A). In three-dimensional motion the 
vector  rκ0  may be represented as 
                   
                                          rκ0 =
 
which is the vector part of quaternion[89].This offers a scope to extend the theory 
in terms of quaternionic Quantum Mechanics [35,36].    
                                      I have said before that tachyons in complex spacetime 
manifold transform into photons at the measurement point(which is a real space 
point).This is equivalent to tachyon condensation [91,92,93,94,95,].Tachyons are 
permitted within the spectra of both open and closed bosonic strings.In tachyon 
condensation, a tachyonic field ----- usually a scalar field ---- acquires vacuum 
expectation value and reaches the minimum of potential energy. Ashoke sen [96] 
observed that open bosonic strings should end on a space-filling  D25 brane, and 
the tachyon should be identified with the instability mode of the above brane. He

conjectured that Witten`s  open string field theory could be used to obtain a new 
vacuum in which the D25 brane is annihilated through condensation of tachyonic 
unstable mode. Open string tachyon condensation carries the physical system to 
a stable state, which, in our theory, is the photon at the measurement point where 
no tachyon exists.The Higgs mechanism [97] is an example of tachyon 
condensation. In our theory, the tachyon,  in inaccessible complex spacetime, 
gives its mass to stable photon at real spacetime point. Sen`s three 
conjectures[57,58] triggered widespread investigation, and his first and third 
conjectures have been found to be almost accurately true.[59,60,61].Sen`s 
second conjecture may seem puzzling.Its first part says that ,after tachyon 

 

41

i

condensation,the corresponding D-brane system disappears leaving nothing for 
open strings to end on. This is consistent with our finding that the condensation 
occurs at the MP, and the open string tachyon pops up as a photon at the MP. 
And in doing so, the open string curls up as a circle of radius  ±i , as is evident 
p = ±2πb g .This implies that, at the MP, the tachyonic open string 
from Eq.(89):  l
transforms into a closed circular string ----- which is consistent with the second 
part of Sen`s second conjecture.                                                                                     
Tachyon theories have always had the problem of causality violation staring in 
the face. But complex spacetime manifold comes to its rescue.In complex 
spacetime such phenomena would not occur in the first place. And tachyons           
---- forever unobservable ----- introduces no pathological consequences to the 
physics at the measurement event.  
 
                        It is sometimes said that tachyon speed increases as its energy 
decreases and vice-versa. This causes intriguing problems with charged 
tachyons. But I have assumed tachyon energy (and not tachyon mass ) as 
imaginary. Therfore, an accelerated charged tachyon loses imaginary part of 
tachyon speed. The real part of tachyon speed is zero. Tachyon speed is 
essentially imaginary on account of its imaginary momentum. This rules out a 
run-away effect of small acceleration generating large accelerations. 
                       In Fig.(3) I have shown that the minimum approachable distance 
along the real axis is   lp  ----  the string is housed within its confines. Eq.(89) 
shows that 
            
                                            l
 
i.e. it is the circumference of a circle of radius   ±i . This confirms that the minimum 
approachable distance in Quantum Mechanics is not real. In other words,the real 
line ceases to exist at this point, i.e., there is a puncture of real space around  the 
string. This result is quite similar to space-tearing flop transitions [71,72]. As the 
above equation shows, the hole at the puncture reveals the extra (imaginary ) 
dimension   lp   curled up into a circle of radius  ±i . It is not quite improbable to 
make this happen given the mind-boggling quantum gravity potential, on the 
order of  1053 Gev (obtained from Eqs.(83) and (90),in which the tachyon travels. 
                                         Non-zero photon mass may indicate Lorentz non-
invariance[62,63,64,65,66,67,68].This is compatible with the fact that both string 
theory and loop quantum gravity allow for the possibility of violation of Lorentz 
symmetry. There are reasons to believe that Lorentz invariance may only be a 
low energy symmetry.This is suggested by divergences in Quantum Field Theory 
as well as Quantum Gravity theories. A useful way to study the Lorentz symmetry 
violation is through the possibility of a dispersion relation of the form [69] :

An experiment devised to test Eq.(90B) may prove or disprove the violation of the 
classical concept of Lorentz invariance in Quantum theory. 
                                 Note that Lorentz symmetry is a postulate of the classical 
theory of special relativity. There is no scope of a preferred reference frame 
there. But the measurement problem of Quantum Mechanics has posed the 
problem of preferred basis[73]. In order to resolve it , one has to concede that the 
measurement frame (containing the MP) is hand-picked by the observer or 
measuring device [37]. The reference frame at the MP is thus a preferred 
frame.This idea is also supported by Copenhagen Interpretation. 
                               Modern Quantum Field Theory does not exclude spontaneous 
breaking of Lorentz symmetry. A very small deviation from Lorentz invariance has 
been studied in the perspective of electro-weak interaction[74,75]. 
                               Robert Weingard had remarked,``It seems to me that one 
could be optimistic about a developing theory, even without such evidence, if 
there were at least some clues in either theory or experiment to suggest that the 
new theory was on the right track. Unfortunately, even this is lacking in string 
theory.``[70]. Now that Quantum Mechanics has been able to reveal the ground 
state (tachyon) of free bosonic string, it may now be arguably said that string 
theory is on the right track.

10 predictions fall in Ebs.  
 
Now I refer to the results in paper (B) quoted above[ lower panel of Fig (2)]: 
 
[1] f = 0.43,  V = -0.473u, [falls in EB] 
[2] f = 0.50,  V = -0.550u, [falls in EB]

[12] f = 0.81, V = -0.891u,[falls in EB] 
[13] f = 0.84, V = -0.924u,[misses the EB]  
 
 
In the above, 10 predictions fall within EBs. 
Now I refer to the results in Fig.(1) of the paper (C ) quoted above. 
 
 
[1] f = 0.45,  V = -0.495u, [falls in EB] 
[2] f = 0.54,  V = -0.594u, [falls in EB]

In the above , 6 predictions fall within EBs.  
 
Instead of astronomical evidences, one may look for a time-varying α in 
earth-bound experiments using atomic clocks. Transitions between two nearly 
degenerate states of atomic clock aspired an accuracy[32]:

    7. CONCLUSION 

 
When a time-varying constant was first announced it was almost unanimously 
admitted that this would have  profound implications in almost all branches of 
physics. The present status of all this ``changingα`` experiments is that these 
consistently point towards a revision in our thinking. A change in the value of 
α would violate the Equivalence Principle ------ the conceptual underpinning 
of General Relativity. It was also predicted that our concept of space and time 
would undergo radical change. 
                                We have witnessed quite a few of such surprises.The first 
surprise is that one could hardly expect that a time-varying α is due to 
quantum gravity of photons. A precise quantum gravity formula for the time-
varying fine structure constant has been derived :

After a little approximation,this result has been compared with the results of 
atomic clock experiments. The variation over cosmological time has also been

it has been found to nicely agree with the results from a many-multiplet 
analysis of 128 quaser absorption systems.  
                                   The second surprise is quite dramatic : Quantum 
Mechanics contains gravity! Gravity is included in Quantum Mechanics in the 
guise of quantum potential. Quantum potential has long taken a back seat in 
discussions of quantum phenomena. But this innocuous potential is actually 
the quantum gravity potential of the quantum system concerned. The proof of 

this is : The formula for 

 derived from quantum potential confirmed the 

∆α
α

quaser results.

                  The third and perhaps the greatest surprise is that Quantum 
Mechanics almost effortlessly leads to open string theory.The Schwarzschild 
radius of photon and Planck length satisfy the relation  R
S
                   The fourth surprise : In Planck regime length melts into mere 
numbers.Though this is quite hard to digest, dimensional analysis inexorably 
leads to this .But it was anticipated that space loses meaning at Planck scale. 
                   To summarize the important results obtained,the wave function of 
photon was first derived by assuming a constant space-time derivative of 
phase, i.e., considering it to have constant speed and conserved energy.It is 
expected that the quantum potential for such a photon is zero,since we have 
assumed it massless.Hence quantum gravity is absent in that photon wave 
function.I have given enough reasons to refute the objections to a photon 
wave function. Contrary to what is widely believed I have explicitly found the 
form of photon`s position operator. 

                    Next I have explored the possibility that the functions  

d
φ1  and 
dx

d
φ2  need not necessarily be constants. This led to a photon wave function 
dt

that yielded a space-time varying speed of light:

I averted  the criticism leveled at varying speed of light (VSL) theories by 
showing that quantum phenomena occur in complex  dimensional spacetime 
manifold and light speed is actually a complex quantity. Therefore rulers and 
clocks of real value units cannot conjure up the the necessary changes in 
their units in complex spacetime. 
                                   I have shown that c (x, t ) is greater than today`s speed 
of light  c0 . This brought tachyons in the physics of varying α ----- but with a 
difference. I have acknowledged a tachyon`s imaginary energy and 
momentum in special relativity ------- thereby ruling out their observation in the 
classical theory. But this procedure could afford a real-valued mass for 
tachyon. I have derived tachyon wave function and have shown that they 
travel in complex spacetime. This forever seals the fate of any experiment 
revealing a tachyon . It also help explain that causality is not violated. In the 

 

47

process, I have found the explicit form of the relativistic mass operator. Later it 
was found that tachyons transform into photons at the measurement event. 
This led to a search for the least possible mass of photon. This observation is 
also equivalent to tachyon condensation in open string theory where the 
tachyon reaches a minimum energy and a stable state (photon ).To find the 
photon mass I solved Klein-Gordon equation with an ansatz. This produced 
probability density waves traveling with the particle speed. The Klein-Gordon 
wave function refutes all objections that have been raised time and again 
against it. This solution predicts a photon mass of 17 10 38
− gm , which exactly 
equals the mass obtained in measurement of Gamma Ray Burst event. I have 
found the following quantum-mechanical mass-energy relation :

The above quantum analog of mass-energy relation may be tested 
experimentally to check the validity of the theory. Violation of Lorentz 
invariance owing to non-zero photon mass has been established by deriving a

              I have advanced some strong arguments in favor of identifying the 
self-gravitational potential of photon with quantum potential. And this worked, 
 agreed quite nicely with various 
------- the theoretical prediction of  ∆α α/
types of results obtained from quaser and atomic clock experiments. The 
Schwarzschild radius of photon,  RS  was found to relate to Planck length  lp in 
the following way: 
                                                R
S
 
This realized the unification of gravity with Quantum Mechanics. A theorem 
has been proved stating that a quantum particle cannot have a definite 
position. Nor it can have a definite momentum. This powerful result from 
Heisenberg uncertainty relation immediately removes the singularities at the 
big bang in quantum cosmology, at the center of a Schwarzschild black hole 
and those of the Feynman diagrams of QED. 
                                 It was not an involved process to show that Quantum 
Mechanics leads to String theory. The tachyons  of minimum momentum are 
carried by open strings constituting a half wavelength in the direction of 

p= 2 .

imaginary axis. According to string theory, these strings end on D-branes. Sen 
has conjectured the instability of D-branes. I have found that his second 
conjecture is consistent with our finding that , at the measurement point an 
open string tachyon disappears leaving a stable system (photon ) in its 
place.It has been assured that negative norm states ------ dreaded in string 
theory are actually permitted by standard Quantum Mechanics[37].Quantum 
Mechanics also reveals a puncture in real space ----- equivalent to space-
tearing flop transitions in string theory.The overall physics of Quantum 
Mechanics indicates that string theory is on the right track .

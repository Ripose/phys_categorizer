Abstract

An algorithm for studing the symmetrical properties of the partial diﬀerential equa-
tion of the type Lφ(x) = 0 is proposed. By symmetry of this equation we mean the
operators Q satisfying commutational relations of order p more than p = 1 on the
solutions φ(x):
It is shown, that within the framework of
the proposed method with p = 2 the relativistic D’Alembert and Maxwell equations
are the Galilei symmetrical ones. Analogously, with p = 2 the Galilei symmetrical
Schr¨odinger equation is the relativistic symmetrical one. In both cases the standard
symmetries are realized with p = 1.

[L . . . [L, Q] . . .]φ(x) = 0.

1 Introduction

The symmetry properties of mathematical physics equations contain the important informa-
tion about objects of research.

Some receptions are oﬀered for symmetry research: the classical and the modiﬁed Lie
methods [1], [2], the non-Lie ones [2], [3], the renormgroup concept [4], the method for search
of the conditional symmetries [5],[6], the theoretical-algebraic approach [7]. The purpose of
the present work is the formulation of the new method for obtaining the additional infor-
mation about symmetrical properies of equations. For research we choose the D’Alembert,
Maxwell and Schr¨odinger equations.

2 Method of Research

We begin with a deﬁnition of symmetry, which we shall name as extended one.

Let the equation be given in the space Rn(x)

where L is a linear operator.

Lφ(x) = 0,

Deﬁnition 1 By the symmetry of Eq. (1) we shall mean a set of operators
}
1, 2, . . . , n, . . ., if the result of the successive (p
tor Q(p) transforms a nonzero solution φ(x) into another solution φ′(x) = L(p−1)Q(p)φ(x)

, p =
1)-fold action of the operator L on an opera-
= 0.

{

Q(p)

From Deﬁnition follows, that operators Q(p) satisfy commutational relations of order p

[L [L . . . [L, Q(p)] . . .] ](p−f old)φ(x) = 0.

The extended Deﬁnition:

includes the understanding of symmetry in the case when Eq. (2) is fulﬁled on a set
of arbitrary functions, that is equivalent to [L [L . . . [L, Q(p)] . . .]](p−f old) = 0 [9];

contains the standard understanding of symmetry, when [L, Q(1)]φ(x) = 0 [7];

includes the understanding of symmetry in quantum mechanics sense [L, Q(1)] = 0;

diﬀers from the standard one, as in the framework of the latter by the operators
X (1) =
of symmetry we should mean not the operators
L(p−1)Q(p)

, but the operators

Q(p)

[8].

}

{

{

}

The question is how practically to ﬁnd them. In the present work it is decided by analogy
with the modifed Lie algorithm [2]. Below we consider the case, when p = 2.

Let us introduce a set of operators

which have the following commutation properties

Q(1) = ξa

1 (x)∂a + η1(x);

Q(2) = ξa

2 (x)∂a + η2(x),

[L, Q(1)] = ζ1(x)L;

[L [L, Q(2)] ] = ζ2(x)L.

The given expresions are operator’s versions of the extended Deﬁnition of symmetry. Here
∂a = ∂/∂xa; a = 0, 1, . . . n
1; ξa(x), η(x), ζ(x) are unknown functions; the summation is
carried out over a twice repeating index; the unknown functions may be found by equaling
the coeﬃcients at identical derivatives in the left and in the right parts of ratios and by
integrating the set of determining diﬀerential equations available.

After integrating the general form of the operators Q may be recorded as a linear com-
µ , on which, by analogy with [2] we impose the

α and Q(2)

bination of the basic elements Q(1)
condition to belong in Lie algebras:

A1 : [Q(1)

belong to the sets of

where xa′

(θ=0) = xa; a = 0, 1, . . . n

1; θ is a group parameter [2].

−

For the law of ﬁeld transformation to be found, instead of integrating the Lie equations
dφ′(x′)/dθ = η(x′)φ′(x′), φ′(x′)(θ=0) = φ(x) [2] we shall take the reception [10], which we
shall illustrate by example of one-component ﬁeld.

Let us introduce such a weight function Φ(x) in the ﬁeld transformation law, that

φ′(x′) = Φ(x)φ(x).

We choose the function Φ(x) so that Eq. (1) should transform into itself in accordance with
the generalized understanding of symmetry because of the following additional condition
(the set of engaging equations)

AΦ(x)φ(x) = 0, Lφ(x) = 0.

The former is obtained by replacing the variables in the initial equation L′φ′(x′) = 0. Formula
(10) corresponds to a linearization of the transformed unprimed equation at replacing x′ =
x′(x), φ′(x′) = φ′(Φ(x)φ(x)) [10]. If here A = L, we shall call the symmetry the classical
symmetry and if A
= L, we shall refer it to as the generalized one. By solving Set (11), the
weight function Φ(x) can be put in conformity to each ﬁeld function φ(x) for ensuring the
transition L′

L.

Instead of solving Set (11), the weight function may be found on the base of the symmetry
φ(x′) is a solution too, and φ′(x′) = Φ(x)φ(x) we have [10]

approach. As far as φ′(x′) = Q(1)′

Here the dots correspond to a consecutive action of the operators Q(1)′

a solution φ(x′). Thus, for the function Φ(x) to be found it is necessary to turn to the
unprimed variables in the primed solution φ′(x′), and to divide the result available by the
unprimed solution φ(x) [10].

and [L′, Q(2)′

α

After ﬁnding the weight functions Φ(x) the task about the symmetry of Eq.

(1) for
one-component ﬁeld may be thought as completed in the deﬁnite sense, namely: the set of
the operators of symmetry and the corresponding Lie lgebras are indicated for p = 1 and
p = 2; the groups of symmetry are restored by the given algebras; with help of the weight
functions the transformational properties of ﬁeld φ(x) are determined.

The proposed method allows generalization to the case of multicomponent ﬁeld and a

symmetry of order more high, than p = 2.

4 Conclusion

In summary it is possible to state, that the concept of symmetry is conventional. Dividing
equations into the relativistic and the Galilei-invariant equations makes sense only in the
case, when p = 1. In more general case, when p
1, equations have cumulative symmetrical
properties complying with the principles of relativity in the relativistic, in the Galilei, as well
as in the other versions. In particular, Poincar´e group P10 is the classical group of symmetry
of D’Alembert and Maxwell equations with p = 1 and reﬂects the property of relativistic
invariance of these equations. The Galilei group G10 is the generalized group of symmetry
of D’Alembert and Maxwell equations with p = 2 and reﬂects the property of invariance of
these equations relative to the space and time transformations of the classical physics.

≥

Analogous situation takes place in the case of Schr¨odinger equation with the diﬀerence
that the Galilei group is not the classical one but the generalized group of symmetry of the
equation with p = 1 and the Poincar´e group is the generalized group of symmetry with
p = 2.

Both groups are the subgroups of the 20-dimentional group of inhomogeneous linear space
and time transformations IGL(4,R) in the space R4(x). This group is the maximal linear
group symmetry [11] of the discussed equations in view of relations

[2, Pa] = [Lr

s, Pa] = 0; [2[2, Gab]] = [Lr
where Pa = ∂a, Gab = xa∂b. Owing to this relations, the Galilei symmetry of the D’Alembert
and of the free Maxwell equations and relativistic symmetry of the free Schr¨odinger equation
(the new symmetries of these equations) are not exotic but their natural properties because
the generators of corresponding groups may be composed from the generators of Lie algebra
of IGL(4,R) group.

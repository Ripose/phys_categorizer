Abstract

Free Electron Lasers  driven by  Super-Conducting  Linacs
require the generation,  acceleration and transport of  trains
of bunches with high charge, high  repetition  rate and low
emittance.  A  numerical  model  already  developed  for  the
modeling of beam dynamics in  SC  Linacs  has  been now
extended to  treat RF  guns  with  proper description of  the
photocathode bunch  generation.  The  model  algorithm  is
based  on  a  coupled  integration  of  Newton  and  Maxwell
equations under a slowly varying envelope approximation
the
for  the  time  evolution  of  mode  amplitudes  in 
accelerating structure and an envelope equation description
for a set of bunch slices. In this way  beam  loading effects
and  higher  order  modes  excitation  can  be  studied.  The
application to the TTF-FEL injector as a  particular design
is  presented  and  the  optimization  according  to 
the
invariant envelope concept is  discussed,  in  the  frame  of
single bunch calculations compared to the results  of other
multi-particle codes.

1  INTRODUCTION

Typical beams delivered by  SC  Linacs  at  intermediate
energies  (hundreds  of  MeV)  with  quality  consistent  to
FEL  requirements  (very  low  emittances  at  high  peak
current) are  affected by  multi-bunch  effects  in  the  Linac
(due to the high repetition  rate in  the  train  as  well  as  the
long filling  times  of  the  cavities)  and, at  the  same time,
by  space charge  effects, which  are  still  relevant   at  these
energies to cause emittance degradation due to  correlation.
the  beam  dynamics
Single  bunch  simulations  of 
the
performed  from  the  photo-cathode  surface  up  to 
undulator injection at the Linac exit are at the  far limit  of
multi-particle codes like PARMELA, because CPU  times
of  several  hours  are  typically  required.  Due  to  the  non-
linearity  of 
the  problem,  based  on  space  charge
correlations  within  the  bunch,  standard  rms  linear  space
charge description (as performed by matrix-based transport
codes  like  TRACE3D)  are  not  able  to  describe  the
associated emittance oscillations, as  extensively discussed
in Ref. [1].

When multi-bunch effects are to be  taken into  account,
because  of  the  high  repetition  rate  in  the  train  and,  as
well,  because  of  fluctuations  in  the  pulse  intensity  and
timing  jitters  of  the  laser  driving  the  photo-cathode,  a
multi-particle simulation would be unaffordable.

For  this  reason we recently enhanced the  capability  of
the  code HOMDYN [2],  developed  originally  to  describe
multi-bunch  effects  in  Linacs  under  a  fast  running

envelope description, to model the beam generation at  the
photo-cathode in a photo-injector RF cavity. Higher  mode
excitation  below  cut-off  as  well  as  non-relativistic  beam
dynamics  were  already  being  modeled  by  the  code,  as
reported in Ref. [2].

In  Section  2  we  describe  the  formalism  based  on
envelope  equation  applied  to  a  family  of  representative
bunch  slices,  used  by  the  code  to  predict  the  emittance
behavior in  the  photo-injector and in  the  Linac,  while  in
Section  3  we  show  a  comparison  with  a  multi-particle
code,  anticipating  a  good  agreement  on  beam  emittance
and energy spread, but with  one  order of  magnitude faster
CPU time. A  full  simulation  from  the  cathode up  to  the
second  cryomodules  exit  of  the  TTF  SC  Linac  at  230

the 
oscillations  due  to  cold-plasma  like  oscillations  in  the
beam envelope, still within the  laminar (i.e.  space charge
dominated) regime at this energy, have been found in quite
good agreement with the prediction of  the  theory reported
in Ref.[1].

The  analytical  study  developed  there  is  based  on  a
similar approach than the one followed in HOMDYN, i.e.
the    beam  dynamics  and  associated  emittance  damped
oscillations  are  explained  as  plasma  oscillations
proceeding at the same frequency for all the set of slices in
which  the  bunch  can  be  represented.  The  optimum
operating condition  assuring  the  minimum  emittance  at
the transition from the laminar  to  the  thermal regime has
been predicted to be the acceleration of the beam under the
Invariant  Envelope  condition,  a  particular  equilibrium
mode for an accelerated beam  analogous to  Brillouin  flow
in drifting beams: one of the implications of  such  a beam
transport mode is  the  need to  achieve a  careful  matching
of the beam at  the  exit  of  each accelerating section  as  far
as the beam runs in the laminar  regime,  so  that  the  beam
envelope oscillations  around  the  corresponding  Brillouin
flow are as small as possible.

The laminar regime extends up  to  an  unexpected  high

In  order  to  achieve  the  matching,  the  accelerating

2  NUMERICAL  MODEL

The  basic  approximation  in  the  description  of  beam
dynamics  lays  in  the  assumption  that  each  bunch  is
described by a uniform charged cylinder, whose  length  and
radius  can  vary  under  a  self-similar  time  evolution,
keeping anyway uniform the charge distribution inside the
bunch.  By  slicing  the  bunch  in  an  array  of  cylinders
(Multi-Slices  Approximation),  each  one  subject  to  the
local  fields,  one  obtains  also  the  energy  spread  and  the
emittance degradation due to  phase correlation of  RF  and
space charge effects.

gun  taken into  consideration is  a  1+1/2  cell  operated  at
1.3  GHz,  producing  a  1.  nC  bunch  charge at  80  A  peak

with as laser spot size (hard edge) of 1.5 mm.  Applying  a
1.8 kG peak solenoid field, the beam envelope obtained is
plotted in  Fig.1  versus the  beam  propagation  distance  z
from the cathode surface (z=0) down through the gun (175
mm  long)  and  the  following  drift  section.  It  is  clearly
visible  the  strongly  space  charge  dominated  behavior  of
the envelope, going through a gentle laminar waist  in  the
drift.  The  rms  normalized  transverse  emittance  is  also
plotted, clearly showing the emittance correction process.

3  TTF-FEL  LINAC  CASE
We report in  this  section  an  analysis  of  the  TTF-FEL
[3] beam envelope  and  emittance  oscillations  up  to  the
end  of  the  second  cryomodule,  as  shown  in  Fig  2,
corresponding  to  a  beam  energy  of  230  MeV.  The 1  nC
beam is generated in one  and half cells  RF-gun  operating
at 1.3 GHz with 50 MV/m peak field on the cathode, by a
12  ps  long  laser pulse  with  2.5  mm  radius. The  gun  is
embedded in a 0.193 T solenoid field. In  the  drifting tube
downstream  the  gun  the  rms  emittance  reach  a  first
minimum 
the
minimum  (R'=0) envelope (1.79  mm)  at  z=1.2  m  from
the  cathode, where  the  booster  is  placed.  To  match  the
booster  cavity  (9  cells  1.3  GHz  superconducting  cavity)
to  the  beam  we  use  eq  (2)  to  compute  the  accelerating
field needed. It results to be 12 MV/m with I=62  A  and g
= 11. Downstream  the  booster  the  rms  emittance reach a
second  minimum  (1.108  mm  mrad)  in  the  long  drift
section  foreseen 
to  house  focusing  and  diagnostic
elements  and  a  chicane  compressor.  It  has  been  also
proposed [5] to use a long  solenoid  around the  beam line
to limit the envelope and emittance oscillation  around the
minimum.  The  same  result  can  be  achieved  also  by
splitting the solenoid  in  three  shorter  lenses,  providing a
small  envelope  oscillation

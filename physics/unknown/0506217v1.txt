Abstract 
Processes  of  mass  communications  in  complicated  social  or  sociobiological  systems  such  as  marketing,  economics, 
politics, animal populations, etc. as a subject for the special scientific discipline – “mediaphysics” – are considered in its 
relation with sociophysics. A new statistical physics approach to analyze these phenomena is proposed. A keystone of 
the approach is an analysis of population distribution between two or many alternatives: brands, political affiliations, or 
opinions. Relative distances between a state of a “person’s mind” and the alternatives are measures of propensity to buy 
(to affiliate, or to have a certain opinion). The distribution of population by those relative distances is time dependent 
and  affected  by  external  (economic,  social,  marketing,  natural)  and  internal  (mean-field  influential  propagation  of 
opinions, synergy effects, etc.) factors, considered as fields. Specifically, the interaction and opinion-influence field can 
be generalized to incorporate important elements of Ising-spin based sociophysical  models and kinetic-equation ones. 
The distributions were described by a Schrödinger-type equation in terms of Green’s functions. The developed approach 
has been applied to a real mass-media efficiency problem for a large company and generally demonstrated very good 
results despite low initial correlations of factors and the target variable. 
 
Key words: Statistical physics, econophysics, sociophysics, mean-field approach, communications, media, mass media, 
opinions propagation, influence.  
 
 

1. Introduction 

The object of the present paper is a methodology 
of  application  of  statistical  physics  to  the  complicated 
phenomena  of  mass  communications.  These  phenomena 
take  place  practically  in  all  social  and  sociobiological 
systems  and  have  been  already  widely  studied  under 
different  names  and  with  different  approaches.  In  our 
opinion,  they  play  such  a  significant  role,  that  they  are 
worth  not  only  a  devoted  field  of  studies,  but  also  the 
application  of  dedicated  methodologies.  Thus  this  article 
outlines  a  field  that  we  called  “mediaphysics”  and 
proposes a general physical model, capable of serving that 
field.  Mediaphysics  may  be  determined  as  a  part  of 
sociophysics,  studying  processes  of  mass  communications 
in  social  and  sociobiological  systems;  it  has  its  own 
subject and operates with data of certain types.

communications. 
Communications  between  units  (people  or  animals)  in 
some  important  sense  have  similar  nature  in  social  and 
sociobiological  systems  (Wilson,  2000).  It  was  studied 
earlier 
the 
importance  of  that  field  encourages  some  isolation  of  the 
subject.  The  importance  of  the  subject  was  already 
realized, for example, in an excellent recent study of social 
insects  behavior  (Bonabeau,  Dorigo,  Theraulaz,  1999), 

from  different  perspectives;  however

which  is  based  entirely  on  a  concept  of  communications 
mechanisms. 

2.  Data  -  observed  and  unobserved. 

  Let’s 
consider  two  datasets:  (a)  20  weekly  observations  of  J. 
Smith’s  Coca-Cola  purchases,  and 
(b)  20  weekly 
observations  of  Coca-Cola  sales  in  the  USA.  Traditional 
statistics will treat those sets identically. However, they are 
qualitatively  different.  In  case  (a)  the  level  of  purchase  is 
explained  by  individual  behavior  of  J.  Smith,  his  habits, 
income, etc. In case (b) the same explanation is applied too 
(all individuals, buying soda in the USA, have motivations, 
similar  to  J.  Smith’s  one);  but  on  a  top  of  that,  there  is  a 
structure  of  these  individuals  by  their  distribution  in 
readiness and willingness to buy soda in general and Coca-
Cola  specifically.  The  last  distribution  is  changing  over 
time and that is something very important which does not 
exist in case (a). The sales  value  for the USA is in  fact a 
result  of  millions  of  individual  actions,  which  appears 
mostly  in  an  unobserved  form.  The  observations  are  just 
the  tip  of  the  iceberg  and  reflected  in  the  sales  volume. 
Mediaphysics  can  work  with  both  observed  and 
unobserved data in a single model. 
 
Traditionally,  social and biological sciences used 
statistics  (not  statistical  physics)  to  describe  the  above 
mentioned  phenomena,  ignoring  the  deep  differences 
between two data types and using just observed ones. We

propose  to  analyze  systems  like  (b)  using  developed 
techniques  of  statistical  physics.  It  is  an  appropriate  tool 
due to the deep similarities between behaviors of particles 
or  molecules  en  mass  (typical  unobserved  units),  and 
processes described above. However, it does not mean that 
mediaphysics  should  employ  only  approaches  like  the 
proposed one. 
into 
The 
  
sociophysical  realm  needs  some  comments,  to  describe 
why  it  seems  necessary,  and  to  provide  historical  and 
linguistic  connotations.  Here  we  briefly  outline  some 
general points. 

of  mediaphysics 

placement 

Sociophysics has acquired growing popularity for 
the  last  few  decades,  but  in  our  opinion  its  field  is  not 
clearly  determined  yet.  It  should  be 
logically  and 
historically  rooted  from  the  first  ideas  of  socio-physical 
analogies  by  Vico  and  de  Condorcet  through  the  famous 
“Physique sociale” by A. Quetelet (1835; second edition in 
1869).  In  modern  times  the  term  was  reestablished  in 
(Galam, Gefen and Shapir, 1982), without reference to the 
mentioned  “fathers-founders”.  Instead,  in  2004,  S.  Galam 
makes an elegant statement: “I feel to claim paternity over 
Sociophysics…” though mitigated with reasonable concern 
that  “…paternity  always  contains  a  little  bit  of  a  doubt, 
how to perform an ADN check” (Galam, 2004). Well, we 
are not DNA test specialists, but able to testify that if our 
translation  of  Physique  Sociale  as  Social  Physics,  and 
further 
to 
Sociophysics  is  correct,  then  the  worst  of  Galam’s 
suspicions  about  paternity 
(or  even  “great-grand-
childhoodedness”)  may  be,  indeed,  right.  Also,  some 
works  without  Sociophysics  name  (but  about  the  same 
subject)  appeared  earlier  (Weidlich  1971;  Gallen  and 
Shapiro,  1974;  see  also  reviews 
the  books  by 
Schweitzer, 2003, and Weidlich 2000).

A  similar  uncertainty  exists  about  Sociophysics 
subject. In (Arnopoulos, 1993 and 2005), the only modern 
books  we  know  under  that  title,  the  sociophysics  has  a 
super-universal  meaning  and  embraces  both  nature  and 
social  life  within  entire  paradigm  (universal  definition). 
The  latest  reviews  (Stauffer,  2003,  2005),  do  not  provide 
exact  definitions,  but  actually  describe  a  much  more 
narrow  field,  limited  mainly  (but  not  only)  by  computer 
simulations  of  social  phenomena  based  on  (supposedly, 
but not always in practice) physical principles (simulation 
definition).  Characteristically,  the  authors  of  those  “two 
schools” do not cite each other, although the first edition of 
Arnopolous’s  book  took  place  in  1993.  For our  purposes, 
we may tentatively define sociophysics as a science about 
the  application  of  physics 
in  social  sphere  (broad 
definition).  

Another  related  field  with  established  name, 
econophysics, falls into that  broad definition. It is  mostly 
dedicated  to  applications  of  statistical  physics  to  stock-
options  pricing  and  portfolio  optimization  (Mantegna  and 
Stanley,  2000;  McCauley,  2004).  There  is  also  smaller 

 

 

number of studies in the more traditional economical areas 
(Econophysics of Wealth Distributions, 2005).  

In 

popular 

simulation 

the  most 

sense, 
sociophysics typically considers a society represented as a 
set of interrelated and interacted nodes (people) on lattice 
(Ising  model  and  its  generalizations)  or  a  random  graph, 
subject to further computer simulation of its dynamics (see 
also  review:  Sznajd-Weron,  2005).  In  models  like  that,  a 
certain  number  of  randomly  selected  agents,  either 
convince  their  neighbors  of  their  opinion,  or  adjust  their 
own opinion, or adjust both  their and neighbors opinions.  
It could be called Social Simulation, where physics is not 
necessarily 
involved.  The  corresponding  analytical 
approaches are less developed. However, many interesting 
analytical  studies  were  published  during  last  few  decades 
(see,  for  instance,  Weidlich,  1971;  Schweitzer,  2003; 
Slanina  and  Lavicka,  2004;  Wu  and  Huberman,  2004; 
etc.). A big plus of the simulation approach is its simplicity 
for  formulation  of  a  simulated  scenario,  and  hence  the 
number of possible models is limited only by researcher’s 
curiosity. A lot of interesting results were already obtained 
in  that  direction.  However,  this  approach  has  some 
intrinsic problems.  

real 

applications  were 

Simulations have significant limits in numbers of 
objects  and  involved  factors.  And  these  restrictions  are, 
indeed,  observed  in  majority  of  publications  that  makes 
them  far  from  measured  reality,  while  capturing  some 
directional and qualitative observations. For the history of 
sociophysics  simulation  (at  least  from  about  50  papers 
published last five years we reviewed) just a few examples 
of 
presented.  Typically, 
sociophysics  simulation  models  do  not  use  real  data  to 
estimate  models  parameters.  Such  freedom  from  reality 
allows,  on  one  hand,  checking  exotic  hypotheses,  but  on 
the  other  hand,  leaves  too  much  room  for  arbitrary 
decisions.  One  of  the  most  cited  applications  of  the 
sociophysics  simulations  is  a  modeling  of  election  results 
in  Brazil,  that  was  called  “…at  present  the  strongest 
validation  of  the  Sznajd  Model”  since  its  introduction  in 
2000 (Fortunato, 2005). However, while not disputing the 
results  of  that  study,  it  is  doubtful,  that  real  life  election 
results depend only on a positive interaction of people; and 
that  advertising,  negative  word-of-mouth  effects,  and  the 
political  programs  of  candidates  (factors,  which  were  not 
considered) do not affect the results.  

Modern  causal  theory  (Pearl,  2000)  applies  very 
sophisticated  methods  just  to  separate  “causation  vs. 
correlation”, a problem that in physics usually stands in a 
very  different  manner  (see,  for  instance,  Arnopoulos, 
2005) and usually doesn’t stand in simulations at all. The 
danger is that impressive results in an idealized world may 
be  even  directionally  wrong  in  real  application.  For 
instance,  if  only  interactions  between  people  can  explain 
the election results, as in the cited example above, it can be 
easily imagined that if one would apply only advertising he 
could  get  the  same  results.  It  may  happen  because 

2 

advertising is a cause of neighbors convincing (people are 
convinced  not  because  they  are  neighbors,  listening  each 
other,  but  because  they  also  watched  the  same  TV  show 
yesterday).  This  effect 
is  widely  known  as  multi-
colinearity  (one  “cause”  is  to  be  explained  by  another 
correlated  with  the  first  one)  in  statistics,  but  not  in 
statistical  physics.  So,  there  is  a  methodological  gap 
between  these  two  ways  of  looking  at  the  same  social 
phenomena.  The  current  sociophysics-simulation  view  is 
extremely  useful  showing  things  from  very  different 
prospective  and  challenging  the  traditional  statistical 
techniques, but does not fill the gap by itself.  

The

introduced  mediaphysics  overlaps  with 
and 
discussed 
statistics,  but  focuses  only  on  communications  and  thus 
belongs  to  the  sociophysics  field  inside  its  universal  and 
broad  definitions.  The  mediaphysics  orients  to  real-life 
data,  what  currently  is  not  typical  for  sociophysics 
simulations.  It  deals  with  both  observed  and  unobserved 
data  unlike 
traditional  statistical  approaches.  Plus, 
mediaphysics is associated with two meanings of the term 
“media”, both of which are relevant to the approach: media 
in  which  mass  processes  of 
as  an  environment 
communications are taking place; and, in a form of “mass-
media”,  as  an  advertising  (or  other  messages)  spreading 
through  mass  communication  channels,  which  itself  is  a 
very important topic. 

The  article  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2 
contains  a  motivating  example  and  defines  new  terms  (in 
spite  of  its  simplistic  style,  it  introduces  important 
concepts  used  thereafter,  especially  concept  of  mindset’s 
space  and  motion  in  there);  in  part  3  we  describe  main 
formalism,  based  on  Green’s  functions  and  Schrödinger-
type equation; section 4 demonstrates how this approach is 
related  with  two  important  modern  statistical  techniques; 
then  in  5  we  discuss  model  implementation  to  the  real 
data; and part 6 presents conclusion remarks.  

2. Competitive fishing and distributions in a 
space of persons’ mindsets 

In  the  modern  world  people  are  subject  to 
hundreds of activities intended to attract customers, voters, 
or  followers.  It  creates  a  strong  competitive  environment 
and can be, roughly but quite reasonably, demonstrated in 
terms  of  a  competitive  fishing  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  This

Fishing  success  depends  on  your  and  your 
competitor’s  positioning  and  the  amount  of  fish  that  are 
swimming around you in the current moment of time. This 
amount is proportional to the volume of yours fishing area 
and  the  corresponding  fish  density  there  (Fig.  2).  In  the 
meantime, the present fishing conditions and its dynamics 
are resulted from  natural  history, and caused by  your and 
your  competitor’s  previous  fishing  activities.  Thus,  the 

 

 

current density in a fishing area contributes to the current 
catch  of  the  area’s  fisherman  through  his  current  baiting 
activity  but,  simultaneously,  the  current  baiting  activity 
can change the properties of the fishing area for the future. 
There are two main factors in the fishing dynamics.

(1) Non-competitive factor: some fish can swim 
in or out of the fishing areas, increasing or decreasing total 
future catch. The biggest portion of the  fish population is 
usually  swimming  outside  the  fishing  areas  and  they 
cannot  be  caught  at  that  moment  neither  by  you  nor 
competitor, but under certain circumstances they can move 
in. 

(2)  Competitive  factor:  fish  can  swim  between 
the  fishing  areas,  increasing  or  decreasing  your  future 
catch. In Fig. 2a and 2b we demonstrate fishing in different 
environments  in  terms  of  volumes  of  fishing  areas  and 
density  distributions  of  the  fish  population.  A  barrier 
between  fishing  areas  in  Fig.  2b  can  complicate  or  even 
prevent  penetrations  between  the  neighboring  fishing

areas.  The  last  case  reflects  two  almost  non-overlapping 
fish markets with almost no short-term competitive effects; 
this state can take place until barrier destruction (long-term 
competitive  effects)  leading  to  significant  increase  in 
possibility to relocate and attract catch from competitors. 

Thus,  analysis  of  density  distributions  and  their 
transformations  is  a  tool  to  deal  not  only  with  short-term 
but  also  long-term  effects  from  external  and  competitive 
factors.  Let  us  consider  the  analogy  a  little  deeper  to 
establish dynamics of fish-population distribution based on 
individual fish behavior.

Single-fish  “free”  swimming.  A  single  fish  can 
be  driven  by  food  and  some  other  attractors  and/or 
repellents.  We  assume  that  if  there  are  no  attractors, 
repellents, space boundaries and barriers around, it moves 
just randomly in any direction searching for food or other 
attractors (we will call it a “free fish”). Naturally, each fish 
cannot  move  too  far  from  its  previous  position  in  any 
lower 
given 
probability  to  be  there  (Fig.  3).  It  means  that  probability 
distribution  of  the  next  position  depends  on  its  previous 
one  and  therefore  this  is  the  Markovian  process.  On  the 
space  scales  much  larger  than  fish  size,  this  distribution 
often  can  be  reasonably  well  described  by  normal  curve 
(Gaussian behavior with direct Brownian-motion analogy), 
but  generally  speaking  it  is  not  always  true  (for  example, 
for a sort of fish which remembers its orientation in space 
for a long period of time). For any symmetric distribution 
of next-step location probability, one of the most important 
physical 
root-mean-square 
is 
displacement  a  (see Fig. 3 and comments in 3.1), which is 
a measure of fish’s “flexagility”. This term, a combination 
of  a  mind’s  flexibility  and  a  person’s  agility,  is  coined  to 
replace  more 
social 
applications,  or  more  precisely,  to  reflect  causes  of  the 
human ability to be displaced far enough from the previous 
state. A highly flexible person often changes directions of 
the  movement,  an  agile  person  moves  fast  in  a  given 
direction.  Thus,  a  low  flexibility  combined  with  a  high 
agility always provides a high displacement,  while a high 
flexibility  together  with  a  low  agility  guarantees  a  low 
displacement.  Two  other  combinations  lead  to  different 
results  depending  on  the  values  of  these  parameters.  A 
person  is  flexagile  if  he/she  changes  states  of  mind 
(opinions, preferences, etc.) easily and fast in the absence 
of external forces.

Fish types. It is natural to define that two or more 
fishes are of the same type (i.e. the group is homogeneous) 
if they all have the same next-moment position distribution 
(Fig.  3)  with  respect  to  their  corresponding  current  states 
(current states are different for each fish). Thus, all the fish 
from  one  homogeneous  group  are  characterized  by  the 
root-mean-square  displacement  a .  By

the  same  in  their  behavior  and,  therefore,  belong  to  the

always  move  randomly.  It  is  attracted  to  some  locations 
(by  food,  bait,  etc.)  and  repulsed  from  others  (by 
something  dangerous).  These  factors  can  change  next-
position  probability  distribution  for  each  fish  by  giving  a 
priority  to  some  swimming  direction  (Fig.  4a  vs.  “free” 
swimming in Fig. 3) and/or transforming the distribution to 
a more flat form (Fig. 4b). The process is still Markovian. 
However,  the  movement  is  now  described  not  only  by 
“free  fish”  root-mean-square  displacement  a   (restriction 
for too far moves), but also its aspirations (forces), which

are  caused  by  different  stimulus  (fields).  Mathematical 
aspects of these effects will be described below in section 
3. Here, we would like to mention that forces (or fields as 
their originators) applied to fishes can have very a different 
nature and characteristics, and be caused also by “internal” 
fish  factors,  such  as  interactions  between  fishes:  for 
instance,  it  could  be  a  food  information  transduction 
(influence)  inside  fish  community.  Boundaries  and/or 
obstacles  can  disturb  the  fish  behavior  as  well.  For 
example,  a  “free  fish”  in  a  closed  area  in  a  long  enough 
period  of  time  can  be  found  everywhere  in  that  area  with 
equal probability.

distribution.  Each  fish  has  a  single  position  at  each 
moment  of  time,  contributing  to  population  distribution 
over  the  available  space.  Then,  each  fish  from  that 
distribution  moves  and  has  own  next-moment  position 
probability  distribution  (Fig.  3  and  4)  in  respect  to  its 
is  known).  As  we  have 
previous  position  (which 
mentioned,  these  individual  distributions  can  be  different 
for  different  fishes  and  undergoes  an 
influence  of 
attractors, repellents and internal interactions. The sum of 
individual  next-moment  position  distributions  for  all 
fishes,  constructed  around  their  corresponding  individual 
previous  positions 
is  a  new  (next-step)  population 
distribution.  In  a  continuous  limit,  the  sum  has  to  be 
replaced by integral over available space of the individual 
next-step  distributions  with  previous  population  position 
distribution taken as a weight factor. This procedure can be 
repeated  many  times  to  describe  dynamics  of  the  fish 
population,  based  on  the  individual  fish  behaviors,  and 
accumulating  all  available  factors,  including  previous 
baiting  activities,  both  their  own  and  competitor’s  ones. 
(See mathematical description in 3.1.) 

Back to social life.  After  we have exploited the 
fishing  analogy  deeply  enough,  we  can  construct  a  frame 
for  social  life  analysis,  where  all  considered  aspects  will 
naturally fall into. We will discuss it using an example of 
marketing activity,  keeping obvious links  with voting and 
religious  or  political  affiliations,  and  still  referring  to  fish 
example  when  appropriate.  Instead  of  fishes  and  their 
distributions in  water,  we  will consider personal  mindsets 
in a space between two (Fig. 5) or many choices (Fig. 6), 
and their distributions for a human population. Changes in 
personal  mindsets  (stimulated  by  many  factors  including 
advertising  activities)  can  lead  to  transformations  of 
distributions  over  time.  Here,  we  are  using  several 
definitions that are worthy to emphasize especially.  
•  Units  are  individuals,  who  make  some  decisions:  fish, 
decided  where  and  what  to  eat;  people,  decided  where 
and  what  to  buy  (what  party  to  join,  what  religion  to 
follow, etc.). 

•  Space, in which the units move. It is a river’s basin for 
fish;  a  virtual  space  of  “willingness  to  buy”  (or 
“propensity  to  join  or  believe”)  within  a  person’s 
mindset for people.

•  Dimensionality  of  this  space.  It  depends  on  model.  If 
we consider just two alternatives, say, the willingness to 
buy  products  of  a  specific  brand  name  vs.  any  other 
brands, then the dimensionality is one, because with two 
choices only a  unit’s position along the line connecting 
two  alternatives  matters.  Extra  dimensions  can  arise 
from  explicit  multi-brands  competition,  competition 
between categories of products inside single brands, and 
some other real-life complexities. 

•  Special  dimension  of  the  space  may  be  called 
“demand”,  which  reflects  a  desire  (supported  by 
financial  ability)  to  buy  any  product  in  a  specific 
category (for instance, any nonalcoholic beverages).  
•  Next-moment position distribution for a “free” single 
unit  can  be  usually  characterized  by  the  root-mean-
square displacement  a  that can be different for different 

5 

unit types. The displacement  a  is a measure of personal 
flexagility.  The  higher  the  flexagility,  the  higher  the 
probability  that  a  person  changes  significantly  his/her 
opinion  within the  next  moment, regardless of previous 
state. 

•  Population  distribution  is  a  normalized  sum  of  all 
single-unit  distributions,  calculated  using  previous 
population distribution as a starting point for each unit. 
•  Catch  is  a  number  (or  portion)  of  units  absorbed  on 
(caught  by  or  bought)  an  alternative  (brand,  opinion, 
fisherman’s baiting hook, etc.). This is an observable or 
measurable  value,  which  reflects  only  one  point  or  a 
specific part from the entire population distribution.  
•  Observed  and  unobserved  parts  of  the  population. 
Usually many parts of the population distribution are not 
directly observed, but contribute to future catches due to 
unit  motions  and,  therefore,  the  knowledge  about  an 
entire distribution is very important. Thus, if a fisherman 
knows,  that  a  huge  fish  shoal  is  approaching  (the 
distribution is skewed to his shore, but not observed yet), 
he will not pack his stuff and go home. The same is true 
in  marketing.  The  mediaphysical  approach  can  analyze 
and  forecast  the  hidden  distribution  forms.  By  extra 
measurements  (e.g.  surveys),  some  hidden  parts  of  a 
distribution  can  become  observed,  providing  an 
additional knowledge about the distribution shape. Thus, 
these measurements are very important and desirable for 
the understanding of hidden processes and model tuning. 
•  Fields are considered as originators of forces applied to 
units  and  cause  their  trends  to  move  in  specific 
directions.  In  marketing,  those  are  reduced  factors  of 
advertising, economical situation, seasonality, influential 
effects (“mouth-to-mouth” information that is very hard 
to count in traditional statistical approaches, but what is 
a hot topic in sociophysics), price, and so on. Fields are 
that  are 
functions  of 
described  in  3.3.  The  field  approach  is  based  on 
principles,  which,  being  logically  developed,  lead  to 
important statistical concepts postulated in the “adstock” 
paradigm  for  marketing  with  prolonged  lag  effects  and 
the “yield” analysis with individual-effect estimations in 
each data point (see chapter 4). 

the  corresponding  variables 

•  Homogeneity  or  heterogeneity  of  the  population  is 
taken into account by considering the same or different 
next-moment  position  distributions  for  a  “free”  single 
unit  (i.e.  the  same  or  different  the  root-mean-square 
ia ).  The  organic  way  to  incorporate 
displacements 
population heterogeneity is another serious advantage of 
the proposed approach from traditional methods.  
•  Initial  conditions  for  population  distribution 

is 
starting point for analysis of the system dynamics. They 
are  based  on  substantive  knowledge  of  the  system.  For 
marketing,  initial  population  distribution  has  to  be 
coordinated  with  the  market  share,  which  is  usually 
known.  

 

 

All  these  components  are  used  to  construct  a  formal 
description of the mediaphysical model. 

3. Physical approach to the problem 

Here  we  describe  a  mathematic  (or  statistical 
 
physics)  technique  to  analyze  population  distribution 
between  two  or  many  alternatives.  Relative  distances 
between  a  person’s  mindset  and  the  alternatives  are 
measures of person’s propensity to buy, see  Fig. 5 and 6. 
The  state  of  a  person’s  mind  depends  on  its  state  at  the 
previous  moment of time and also is subject to the action 
of  many  factors  of  different  originations, 
including 
external  (economic,  social,  marketing  and  so  on)  and 
internal ones (influential propagation of opinions, synergy 
effects, etc.). 

As it has been mentioned above, the fundamental 
feature  of  the  considering  system  is  a  Markov  chain 
probability of each unit to be within certain distance from 
previous  state  at  any  given  time.  This  probability  is 
determined  by  the  flexagility  in  a  mental  space.  It  makes 
the  process  very  similar  to  the  Brownian  motion  under 
action  of  external  fields.  The  corresponding  mathematical 
approach is well developed in statistical physics and based 
on Green’s functions.

We should emphasize that equations (3) – (6) are

these  cases  we  can  consider  the  interval  between  two

identify  (2)  as  the  Chapman–Kolmogorov  equation  for

the 

Influential  part  of  the  fields  deserves  a  special 
consideration.  As  we  have  mentioned  above,  there  exist 
many  attempts  to  analyze  influential  factors  in  opinion 
propagation  in  sociophysics.  Their  majority  is  based  on 
Ising-type  models,  which  assume  sophisticated  person-to-
person  interaction  principles.  It  is  clear  that  consideration 
of  each  person  individually  is  not  always  acceptable, 
especially  for  large  populations.  Here,  we  propose  a 
different  approach  that  is  used  in  statistical  physics  to 
describe volume interactions between particles. This is, so-
approach,  where 
called, 
interactions (or influences here) are determined by density 
distributions  of  units  over  a  space  of  positions  (or 
opinions, as described above). In this paper, we reproduce 
this  approach  in  the  second  (pair  or  unit-to-unit)  virial

4. Links to modern statistical techniques

the  proposed  mediaphysical  approach,  we  can  recognize 
many  concepts  postulated  in  modern  statistics.  On  one

hand,  this  makes  the  approach  naturally  related  with 
modern statistics. On the other hand, the links between the 
mediaphysical  approach  and  some  of  the  concepts  make 
clearer  not  only  the  origination  of  the  concepts  but  also 
their  positioning 
in  a  whole  picture  of  analyzed 
phenomena.  

including 

Here we demonstrate the straightforward links of 
the  proposed  approach  with  (a)  lag  concepts  and  their 
modifications 
trend  analysis,  Box-Jenkins 
models  or  adstock  ones  in  marketing  (Broadbent,  1997; 
Mandel  and  Hauser,  2005),  and  (b)  random  coefficients 
mixed  models  (Demidenko  and  Mandel,  2005).  Both 
concepts,  in  fact,  are  generalizations  of  large  classes  of 
models  in  time  series  analysis  and  regression  and  very 
important  for  multiple  applications.  To  start,  let  us  to 
remind briefly the forms of basic equations in each of the 
concepts.

First two terms in (32) are in the agreement with 
generalized equation (24) for lags and random-coefficients 
mixed  models.  Mathematical  expressions  for  coefficients 
(33)  –  (35)  are  approximations  for  the  purpose  of  links 
demonstration  only.  Simultaneously,  here  we  show  the 
main  difference  between  the  mediaphysical  approach  and 
common  statistical  techniques:  it  is  the  last  term  in  (32) 
which  is  absent  in  (24).  This  term  is  basically  what  this

5. Model implementation and interpretation 

Now we have a mathematical model to deal with. 
The  starting  point  is  an  initial  unit-density  distribution, 
which has to be in agreement with market share or own-to-
competitor  ratio  of  average  catches  (sales  or  voters)  from 
first  available  time  points.  If  we  do  not  have  any  other 
information  about  unit-density  distribution, 
then  we 
propose  to  use  a  truncated  normal  or  “double”  normal 
distribution  in  a  manner  to  adopt  known  market  share  or 
initial 
the  ratio  above.  If  some  parameters  of 
distribution are not defined from the very beginning, they 
can be fitted later to adjust system dynamics.  

the 

Then,  we  calculate  system  behavior  during  time 
in  terms  of  Green’s  function,  using  described  above 
equations,  which  for  1D  system  are  (12)  –  (18)  with  the 
normalization  (10).  In  Fig.  7  we  present  an  example  of

In  this  approach,  the  majority  of  effects  can  be 
analyzed  by  numeric  calculations  and  solutions  of  the 
equations. However, we can provide analytical estimations 
for  some  results:  for  instance,  short-term  effects  (strictly 
speaking,  next time point:  while it can be  next day,  week 
or month) of advertising for a specific channel  i . Thus, a 
relative  increase  in  sale  dollars  per  advertising  dollar  can

The similar equations are valid for both own and 
competitor’s results. However, let us emphasize once more 
that it is valid for short-term effects. Long-term effects can 
be much more complicated and have to be analyzed under 
numeric computations. 

Parameters  of  the  model,  which  are  not  defined 
from  the  very  beginning,  have  to  be  determined  from  the 
best fitting of model. Then, the adjusted parameters are to 
be used for forecasting, optimization of decisions, and for 
what-if analysis. To estimate these parameters we used an 
optimization  procedure  developed  specially  for 
this 
methodology  (a  kind  of  genetic-type  algorithm  with 
stochastic components). However, it is possible to use any 
reliable  optimization  procedure  dealing  with  non-linear 
behavior  with  many  local  extremes  and  completely  non-
analytical definition.

The  developed  approach  has  been  applied  to  a 
real  media  efficiency  problem  for  a  large  company  and 
demonstrated  very  good  results  despite  the  low  initial 
correlations of factors and target variable. 

6. Conclusions 

to  marketing,  social 

We  developed  a  new  mediaphysical  approach  to 
analyze  a  statistical  dynamics  of  real-life  systems, 
composed  by  many  partly-unobserved  units  (usually 
human  population),  where  mass  communications  (both 
internal  and  external)  form  their  behavior.  To  apply  this 
method 
life  and  politics,  we 
introduced  a  concept  of  “persons’  mindsets”  space  with 
distributed attractive and repulsive  field-originated  forces. 
We  considered  and  formalized  the  concepts  of  the 
corresponding space dimensionalities, the distances in this 
space,  and  the  relations  between  states  of  an  individual 
mind  and  the  distribution  of  all  individuals.  It  is  shown, 
that  under  reasonable  assumptions,  the  system  dynamics 
may  be  considered  as  a  specific  Markovian  process, 
described  in  terms  of  Green’s  functions  and  Schrödinger-
type  equation,  well  known  in  theoretical  physics.  We 
showed  links  of  the  mediaphysical  approach  and  such 
important concepts, as effects lasting in time (Box-Jenkins 
models,  adstock  in  marketing),  and  random  coefficients 
mixed  models 
analysis),  what  makes 
mediaphysics  naturally  related  with  modern  statistics. 
Simultaneously,  it  allows  answering  some  questions, 
which  are  usually  not  or  poorly  addressed  in  traditional 
statistical and/or simulational sociophysical models:  
1. A  strong  distinction  between  (a)  data  having  mass 
structure  with  a  distribution  in  some  space,  where  only 
selected  points  can  be  observed  (like  marathon  runners 
with  TV  camera  maintained  on  start  and  finish  lines 
only), and (b) data with only observed units (like single 
runner  with  a  personal  camera)  was  grounded. 
Respectively,  for  the  first  data  type  the  mediaphysical 
approach  is  preferable.  Traditionally,  in  statistics  this 
distinction was not considered. 

(or  yield 

2. The  proposed  method  organically  allows  considering 
both  short-  and  long-term  effects  of  marketing  and 
propaganda  in  a  consistence  form,  avoiding  subjective 
definitions of lag or similar structures.  

3. The 

technique  allows 

formulating,  checking  and 
applying  hypothesis  about  unobserved  population 
homogeneity  or  heterogeneity,  replacing 
traditional 
variables like “percent of educated women over time” by 
distributions  of  personal  behaviors  (“flexagility”  or 
physical  displacements).  Thus,  it  strongly  distinguishes 
variables,  describing  process  and 
those  describing 
population  itself,  which  usually  in  statistics  is  bulked 
together.  

4. The  mediaphysical  approach  allows  accounting  for 
interactions  (influence)  of  the  units  between  each  other 
(the  leading  topic  of  sociophysics,  which  is  not  usually 

 

 

addressed  in  statistics)  in  a  more  general  way  through 
self-consistent fields, that provides a unique opportunity 
to  consider  completely  different  components  of  social 
behavior together within one model, even when number

5. It  predicts  future  system  dynamics  from  its  history  in 
such  a  way,  that  system  connectivity  and  inertia  are 
naturally taken into account. As a result, very important 
aspects of the forecasts (like prediction of hidden bumps 
of unobserved distributions) may be derived and used in 
practice. 

6. For  many  problems  the  method  allows  replacing  a 
simulation  by  analytical  calculations  or  combining  two 
approaches in a reasonable format.

Here,  we 

introduced  basic 

ideas  and 
methodology that we put in the proposed approach. These 
concepts should be developed much deeper. Among next-
steps priorities we may list more detailed enhancements of 
the  multifield  scenarios  and  influential  fields,  non-trivial 
topologies  of 
the  considering  space,  maybe  “tunnel 
transitions”  (immediate  jumps  from  one  opinion  to  the 
opposite  one),  better  optimization  procedures,  and  many 
other  problems.  An  important  topic  could  be  a  what-if 
procedure for different scenarios and assumptions.

stimulating  discussions,  constructive  comments,  and 
multifaceted  undertakings  that  made  this  article  possible. 
We thank Gary Gindler for critical reading of the text and

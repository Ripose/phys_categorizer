Abstract 

Nonlinear  effects  were  observed  in  a  forced  vibrating  string.  The  motion  of  the  string 

becomes elliptic as the amplitude of the vibration increases. The fundamental resonance 

frequency  depends  on  the  amplitude  of  the  vibration.  At  sufficient  high  amplitudes  the 

system exhibits hysterisis: the resonance frequency is different when measured increasing 

the  driving  frequency  or  decreasing  it.  The  experimental  results  are  well  understood  in 

the framework of a 2-dimensional model assuming that the string tension is not constant 

due to the varying length of the string throughout the oscillation. 

 

 

1. Introduction 

 
In  the  framework  of  our  classes  on  the  experimental  study  of  wave  motion  we  have 

developed  a  kit  for  the  study  of  a  vibrating  string.  A  copper  wire  string  is  held  in 

mechanical tension between two points (see Fig. 1). An AC current passing through the 

wire,  coupled  with  the  magnetic  field  of  a  permanent  magnet,  produces  the  mechanical 

vibration of the string. With this setup we can change the mechanical tension applied to 

the string, as  well  as its length and the excitation frequency. The AC current applied to 

the  wire  is  provided  by  a  specially  designed  power  amplifier  with  a  maximum  peak 

current output of 6A and a bandwidth of 1Hz-1MHz. The possibility of using such high 

currents enables us to explore the nonlinear behaviour of the vibrating string.

It is commonly observed that the motion of the string is transversal (polarized) for small 

amplitudes but, as the amplitude of the oscillation increases, the string goes into a circular 

or  tubular  motion.  The  symmetry  of  this  circular  motion  may  be  broken  by  assymetric 

string mounts or if the wire is magnetic (e.g. steel). 

When scanning the frequency, there are amplitude discontinuities (jump phenomena) and 

the resonance frequencies show hysteresis. These nonlienar effects can be understood as 

arising  from  the  fact  that  the  tension  cannot  be  held  constant  if  the  string  is  varying  in 

length due to the finite amplitude of displacement. 

The  vibrating  string  has  been  shown  to  have  more  complex  behaviour,  such  as  quasi-

periodic  and  chaotic  motions,  in  particular  when  damping  and  excitation  are  very  large 

[1-3]. These effects however are not discussed in this paper as they are not suitable for an 

introductory course on experimental study of wave motion.

Several authors [1-6] have shown that the equation of motion of the vibrating string can

account the finite stretching of the string and

with T0 being the average tension of the string, µ its linear mass density and 
where λ is the wavelenth. f(ωt) represents the forcing term and R the damping coefficient. 

λπ/2=k
 

We assume that the ends of the string are symmetrically fixed and thus R is a scalar. 

For instance, Tufillaro [1] considered the string as a massless spring with a mass attached 

at  its  centre.  This  mass  is  subject  to  damping  and  forcing.  The  equation  of  motion  is 

derived by expanding the restoring force on the mass in a series, whilst neglecting fourth 

and  higher  power  terms.  In  Gough  [4]  and  Elliot  [5]  the  constant  tension  in  the  linear 

equation is replaced by its Hooke’s law expression. With this approach they were able to 

relate  the  parameter  K with  actual  string  parameters. More recently  Bolwell [6] rewrote 

the equation of motion as

If we neglect the tension oscillation due to the elongation of the string (K = 0 or c2 = 0), 

the compressional longitudinal wave vanishes and we recover the usual linear equation of 

motion of a vibrating string. Assuming that the string is being sinusoidally excited in the

These equations describe two parametrically coupled oscillators with cubic nonlinearities. 

Exciting a nonlinear resonance in one oscillator causes the parametric excitation of linear 

oscillation in the second, which then couples back into the first. One should also notice 

that  the  nonlinearity  is  stronger  for  higher  values  of  c2,  i.e.  when  the  effect  of  the 

longitudinal wave becomes important. 

3. Solutions of the equations of motion 

 

 

In  order  to  gain  some  insight  on  the  physics  of  the  vibrating  string,  we  shall  start  by 

looking  at  the  undamped  free  oscillation  discussing  both  the  circular  and  the  general 

solutions.  We  shall  be  concentrating  on  the  single  mode  solution,  although  one  of  the 

effects of the nonlinearity could be the excitation of higher order modes. Then, we shall 

determine an approximate solution for the equations of motion (5) for the damped forced 

 

 

 

 

solution.  Finally,  we  calculate  the  frequency-response  curve  for  circular  motion  and 

discuss the results. 

3.1. Circular motion for undamped free oscillation  

The simplest solution to the equations of motion for undamped free oscillation equation 

(R = F = 0)  is circular motion with constant radius, A,

In  this  situation  the  elastic  restoring  force acts as a centripetal force responsible for the 

circular motion. Introducing these solutions into Eq. (5) we get 

which means that there is an adjustment to the motion frequency due to the stretching of 

the  string.  As  expected,  we  can  see  that  this  de-tuning  of  the  resonance  frequency  is 

larger for increasing amplitudes. 

3.2. General solution for undamped free oscillation 

The  general  solution  for  the  undamped  free  vibrating  string  equations,  determined  by 
considering a reference frame rotating at angular velocity Ω, can be shown to be [5]

3.3. Approximate solution for damped forced oscillation 

For the damped forced  oscillations of the  vibrating  string we  start  by assuming that the 

motion will take place at the driving frequency and is composed of two waves travelling 

in opposite directions:

that can be combined to yield the trajectory traced by the string in the xy-plane: 

This  result  agrees  with  the solution determined by Elliot [7] using the Duffing method.

b  is  imaginary  and  has  no  real  solution,  and  the  motion  becomes  a  purely  polarized 

oscillation in the driving plane. This is the solution of the linear equation in which there 

is no coupling between the motions in the driving x-direction and the  y-direction. 

As the amplitude increases pass acrit, b increases towards b = a and the motion becomes 

elliptic. This is due to the strong tension increase with increasing amplitude motion. The 
phase between the motions in the two directions is then an odd multiple of π/2.

3.4. Frequency-response curve  

 

 

 

Experimentally,  the  easiest  procedure  to  test  this  model  of  the  vibrating  string  is  to 

measure the frequency-response curve, i.e. the amplitude of the motion as a function of 

the driving frequency.  

When the string is vibrating near the resonance the amplitude of the oscillation becomes 

large  and,  according  to  the  results  of  the  previous  section,  the  motion  of  the  string 
becomes asymptotically circular. Imposing equal amplitudes and a phase shift of nπ/2 to 

solutions  of  the  from  (10),  the  equation  of  motion  (5)  of  the  damped  forced  string

that describes the frequency-response curve of the vibrating string (see Fig. 3).

nonlinear  term;  b)  Frequency-response  curve  of  nonlinear  vibrating  string  with  (solid  line)  and  without 

(dashed line) damping term. 

The  most  striking  feature  of  this  plot  is  the  bending  of  the  resonance  due  to  the 

nonlinearity  introduced  by  the  variation  of  the  tension.  This  result  indicates,  and 

experiment  confirms,  that  as  the  frequency  is  slowly  increased  the  resonance  frequency 

shifts towards higher values. When we get over the resonance, the system “jumps” down 

to the lowest amplitude available for that frequency, and the circular motion collapses.  

The frequency-response curve also shows that the vibrating string exhibits hysteresis: the 

resonance  frequency  is  different  when  measured  increasing  the  driving  frequency  or 

decreasing it.

Figure 4 shows a typical measurement of the frequency-response curve for a 0.5m long 
copper string (µ = 6.9 10-4 kg m-1, Y = 1.2 1011 Pa) with 0.3mm diameter, and its fit using 

equation  14.  For  the  fit,  the  compression  longitudinal  wave  velocity  c2  was  assumed 

known (using Eq. 4) and the free parameters were F, R and c1. The measured tension was 

3.0N and the force needed to lateraly displace the middle of the string 10mm away from 

its rest position was 0.2N. 

Fig. 4 - Fit to the experimentally measured frequency-response curve for the fundamental harmonic mode 

of a 0.5m long copper string with 0.3mm diameter. 

The fit is well adjusted to the experimental data. We can compare the adjusted parameters 

with  the  actual  parameters  of  the  string.  The  driving  force  F  is  compatible  with  its 

experimental  measurement.  From  c1,  and  using  Eq.  (4),  one  determines  the  average 

tension (T0 = 3.2N), which is also rather close to the tension measured experimentally.  

4.2. String polarisation 

The  polarization  of  the  string,  and  its  dependence  on  the  amplitude,  was  observed  by 

improving the optical contrast of the motion of the string with a painted white dot on the 

centre of the string. The dot is illuminated with a desk lamp.  

Inserting  the  parameters  adjusted  in  the  previous  section  into  Eq.  (15),  one  gets  the 

trajectory of the string in the xy-plane. As discussed in section 3.3, for small amplitudes 

the motion is purely polarized in the plane of the driving force. For amplitudes larger than 

acrit = 3mm the motion of the string becomes elliptic.  

This result was confirmed experimentally.  

5. Conclusions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The nonlinear behviour of the vibrating string can be understood as arising from the fact 

that  the  tension  is  not  constant  due  to  the  varying  length  of  the  string  throughout  the 

oscillation. This effect leads to the propagation of compressional longitudinal waves.  

We have developed a 2-dimensional model where, for each plane, the motion takes place 

at the driving frequency and is composed of two waves travelling in opposite directions. 

The  phase  difference  between  the  motion  in  the  driving  plane  and  the  transverse  plane 
was shown to be an odd multiple of π/2. 

We have shown that the motion of the string is restricted to the driving plane for small 

amplitudes and above an amplitude of acrit the motion becomes elliptic. This effect was 

observed  experimentally.  We  can  then  say  that  the  linear  equation  of  motion  of  the 

vibrating string is thus valid for amplitudes smaller than acrit.  

Furthermore,  the  study  of  the  frequency-response  curve  has  shown  that  the  jump 

phenomena  and  hysterisis  are  reproduced  by  the  model  and  the  fit  to  the  experimental 

data is well adjusted to the actual parameters of the string.

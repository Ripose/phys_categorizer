A  versatile  miniature  de  Broglie  waveguide  is  formed  by  two  parallel  current-

carrying  wires  in  the  presence  of  a  uniform  bias  field.    We  derive  a  variety  of 

analytical expressions to describe the guide and present a quantum theory to show 

that it offers a remarkable range of possibilities for atom manipulation on the sub-

micron scale.  These include controlled and coherent splitting of the wavefunction 

as  well  as  cooling,  trapping  and  guiding.    In  particular  we  discuss  a  novel 

microscopic atom interferometer with the potential to be exceedingly sensitive. 

 

 

An atom whose magnetic moment has projection

B

.  The associated 

force is able to guide weak-field-seeking atoms along a minimum of B.  This principle 

underlies  the  Stern-Gerlach  effect  and  the  magnetic  hexapole  lens,  which  have  played 

such important roles in the history of atomic beams.  Magnetic forces are now a central 

feature of atom optics – the subject of manipulating, confining, and guiding cold neutral 

atom clouds and Bose-condensates [1, 2, 3].

Recently there has been great interest in building miniature magnetic structures where 

small  features  make  a  strong  field  gradient,  while  a  superimposed  uniform  bias  field 

makes  a  zero  whose  position  is  adjustable  [4].    This  idea  has  been  realized  in  several 

laboratories, using either supported wires [5, 6, 7], printed circuits [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] or 

microscopic patterns of  permanent magnetization [13].  Miniature  guides  are  attractive 

because they offer the possibility of propagating de Broglie waves in a single transverse 

mode in 1D [14] or 2D [15].  This is a central goal of many experimental groups because 

it is required for achieving atom interferometry with guided de Broglie waves.  Miniature 

structures are also promising for studying the physics of quantum gases confined to less 

than 3D [16].  In this letter we discuss the guide formed by two wires carrying parallel 

currents I spaced  A2  apart in the presence of a bias field, as illustrated in Fig. 1.  We 

point out that the guide  is far more adaptable than previously realized [9,10], deriving 

simple formulae  for the  various configurations it can produce.  We present a quantum 

theory to show how the guide can be used to manipulate atoms on the sub-micron scale, 

to make a controlled and coherent splitting of the wavefunction, and to realize a novel 

atom interferometer.

 and the  field produced by the wires is 

xb .  This has a single 

maximum of 

1xb

 at height

 as shown in Fig. 2.  The addition of a bias field 

1>

 (in normalized units) along the positive x-direction cancels 

xb  at two positions, 

indicated for 

2/1>

 by the circles in Fig. 2.    For weak-field-seeking atoms, these 

zeros  form  guides  parallel  to  the  z-axis  (a  small  field  may  be  added  along  the  z-

direction  to  suppress  non-adiabatic  spin  flips,  although  states  without  angular 

momentum around the guide axis can be stable without it [14]).  The inset in Fig. 2 

shows the dimensionless guiding potential u.  The barrier between the two guides is 

>1

, while the barrier above the upper guide is  > .  As the strength of the bias field 

is  increased,  these  zeros  approach  one  another  until  they  coalesce  to  form  a  single 

guide  at  height

horizontally and the zeros follow the circle

of Table 1 we present simple formulae  giving the  guide  centers 

(

 and trap 

depths 

0u  in each of the three bias field regimes. 

Fig.  3a  shows  the  interaction  potential  u  and  the  field  lines  for 

8.0>

.    The  trap 

centered on 

2/1y

 is smaller  and 4 times stronger than the upper one at 

2y

 (the 

ratio  of  gradients  is  always  the  inverse  of  the  ratio  of  heights).    Each  guide  is 

cylindrically  symmetric  over  a  limited  region  around  its  center,  and  has  a  constant 

 

3

potential gradient, a characteristic of the quadrupole symmetry evident in the field lines.  

We  note  that  the  fields  are  oppositely  directed  in  the  two  guides.    At  the  two  bottom 

corners,  the  field  can  be  seen  circulating  around  the  current-carrying  wires,  which  are 

taken in this diagram to be of negligible radius.  Figure 3b shows the potential and field 

lines for the single guide, formed at the critical bias.  Here the linear gradient vanishes: 

the  guide  is  harmonic  with  curvature

  and  the  corresponding  hexapole 

symmetry can be seen in the field lines.  At higher bias field the potential splits laterally 

into two quadrupole guides as illustrated in Fig. 3c for 

5.1>

.  Simple formulae for the 

gradients are given in the last row of Table 1. 

If  we  allow  the  bias  field  to  have  a  component  in  the  y-direction,  many  other 

possibilities open up, one of which is particularly relevant, as we will see below.  Let us 

apply both the critical bias 

1>

 along x, and an extra bias of magnitude  >,  at angle   

to the x-axis.  When 

,>

1

, the potential splits into two guides separated by a distance 

>,22

, and the line joining their centers makes an angle 

2/

 with the x-axis.  Thus, 

when the extra bias field is rotated the two guides orbit around the coalescence point at 

half the frequency. 

Each of the three regimes of bias field has interesting features to offer for atom optics 

experiments.  To take a concrete example, consider a guide with a 300 m spacing and 

2 A flowing in the wires, for which the characteristic field and gradient are B0 = 2.7 mT 

and B0/A = 18 T/m (such a structure already exists in our laboratory).  With a weak bias 

field of 0.3 mT (

1.0>

), the upper  guide is centered 3 mm (

>/2A

) above the wires 

and has a field gradient of 0.1 T/m (

1 >
2

2

AB /0

).  This is very well suited to operate as a 

 

4

magneto-optical trap (MOT) with two pairs of suitably polarized light beams in the x-y 

plane, propagating along axes rotated by 45º from the x- and y-axes.  For the purpose of 

initially collecting atoms in the MOT, a pair of auxiliary coils can create a field gradient 

along the z-direction, allowing a third pair of light beams to produce MOT confinement 

along the z-axis.  The MOT can be lowered and compressed to a maximum gradient of 

4.4 T/m (

1
4

AB /0

) by increasing the bias field to 0.23 mT (

3 0B

2/

).  At this point the 

light can be turned off and the auxiliary coils producing the field gradient along the z-axis 

can be switched to produce parallel fields.  This makes a purely magnetic Ioffe-Pritchard 

trap,  where  weak-field-seeking  atoms  can  be  left  in  the  ground  state  by  evaporation.  

Alternatively,  if  a  cold  dense  sample  of  atoms  is  already  available  in  a  macroscopic 

magnetic  trap,  as  for  example  with  a  Bose-Einstein  condensate,  a  single  mode  of  the 

upper guide can be loaded in a “mode-matched” way by suddenly switching off the trap 

and turning on the guide with I,  >  and a z-bias field chosen to duplicate the original trap 

spring constants.  In either case, a subsequent adiabatic variation of the field can bring 

atoms  to  the  coalescence  point  of  the  guide,  where  the  potential  is  harmonic  and  the 

transverse frequency 

0M  is given by

the  particular  guide  we  are  considering  here.    The  ground  state  size

Suppose now that the atoms have all been prepared in the transverse ground state of 

the harmonic guide.  An increase  >,  of the bias field deforms the guide potential into a 

symmetric  double  well,  providing  a  highly  controlled  and  reproducible  50:50  coherent 

splitter for the de Broglie wave.  If the two halves of the atom cloud are held apart for 

some length of time they may act as the arms of an interferometer.  In order to understand 

 

5

the operation of this interferometer in more detail, we have calculated the eigenmodes of 

the  guide  numerically  by  solving  the  two-dimensional  time-dependent  Schrödinger 

equation  with  the  spin  degree  of  freedom  adiabatically  eliminated.    We  start  with  the 

eigenstates 

{(

x nn
,

y

)}

 of a harmonic potential, then slowly deform the potential to obtain 

the corresponding eigenstates of the Hamiltonian  0  for the 2-wire guide at the critical 

bias 

1>

.  Next we slowly vary the bias field to find how the three lowest eigenstates 

and their energies  0  evolve as a function of  > .  We assume that the atom density is 

low,  although  of  course  the  mean  field  interactions  at  higher  density  should  produce 

interesting non-linearities and physics beyond the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. 

Figures  4  and  5  show  the  eigenstates  and  their  energies,  labeled  by  the  quantum 

numbers 

(

x nn
,

y

)

 which count the number of nodes along x and y.  At the critical bias, 

the  spectrum  is  (almost)  harmonic  with  the 

)0,0(

  state  lying 

0MD

  below  the  nearly 

degenerate  pair  of  first  excited  states 

)0,1(

  and 

)1,0(

  (a  small  anisotropy  of  the  guide 

prevents exact degeneracy).  An increase  >,  of the bias splits the guide and the single-

peaked 

)0,0(

 state deforms adiabatically into a double-peaked wavefunction with even 

reflection symmetry in the yz-plane.  As long as it is not perturbed, this of course returns 

to the harmonic ground state when  >  is restored to 1.  If, however, a differential phase of 

F   is  introduced  between  its  two  peaks  while 

1>

,  the  wavefunction  becomes  a  yz-

antisymmetric function, which we recognize in Fig. 4 as the 

)0,1(

 state.  When 

1(cid:1)>

 

this  evolves  adiabatically  into  the  first  yz-antisymmetric  excited  state  of  the  harmonic 

guide.  For arbitrary phase shifts the final state of the harmonic guide is a superposition 

of 

)0,0(

  and 

)0,1(

.    Thus  symmetry  dictates  that  the  two  output  ports  of  the 

 

6

interferometer are two different vibrational states of the harmonic guide.  The third state 

)1,0(

 in Fig. 4 is even under reflection in the yz-plane, like the ground state, but it has a 

vibrational excitation in the y-direction.  This excitation is preserved as the bias increases 

and consequently the energy lies approximately 

0MD

 above 

)0,0(

. 

It  is  also  interesting  to  consider  decreasing  the  bias  to 

1>

.    The  interferometer 

states 

)0,0(

 and 

)0,1(

 both emerge in the upper guide, with 

)0,1(

 having one quantum of 

excitation along the x-axis.  The 

)1,0(

 state however, goes into the ground state of the 

lower guide (Fig. 4). 

Now  we  turn  to  the  practical  aspects  of  the  interferometer.    One  can  estimate  the 

minimum  >,  needed to achieve splitting, 

min>,

, by setting the displacement of the wells 

equal to the ground state diameter  I2 .  To lowest order the result can be expressed in the 

elegant  form

,  which  for  the  guide  in  our  example 

amounts to a change of 64 nT in the bias field.  Achieving this level of control over the 

field  would  require  some  care  but  it  is  not  a  major  technical  challenge.    When  >,   is 

increased further, the splitting between the 

)0,0(

 and 

)0,1(

 levels becomes exponentially 

small (Fig. 5), being equal to the tunneling frequency between the left and right potential 

wells.    As  the  bias  changes,  one  wants  to  avoid  non-adiabatic  transitions  induced  by 

/0


t

.  This operator, being symmetric under reflections in the yz-plane, cannot excite 

the yz-antisymmetric state 

)0,1(

, but it does connect the ground state to 

)1,0(

.  Since this 

and the other coupled states are at least 

0MD

 away in energy, the adiabatic condition is 

that  >,  must change slowly in comparison with the period of harmonic oscillation 

/1 M  
0

(over several milliseconds for the guide in our example).  Once the atoms are split, the 

 

7

antisymmetric perturbation to be measured is turned on.  As is usual in interferometry, 

this interaction has to be non-adiabatic to mix the states 

)0,1(

 and 

)0,0(

 (i.e. to introduce 

a phase shift  2  between the left and right wavepackets) and must therefore be turned on 

and off in times much less than the tunneling period.  This is not a stringent requirement 

since the tunneling can be made arbitrarily slow by a modest increase in  >, .  Finally, 

reducing  >,  to zero, it remains only to read out the fringe pattern through the population 

in state 

)0,0(

[

)0,1(

], which is proportional to 

cos

2

 [

sin

2

]. 

In  principle  the  readout  can  be  done  by  absorption  or  fluorescence  imaging  to 

determine the atom distribution in the guide, although this method requires high spatial 

resolution.    Alternatively,  there  are  at  least  two  methods  for  separating  the 

)0,0(

  and 

)0,1(

 populations.  First, if the guide is operated without any axial bias field and  >  is 

reduced below 1 to extract both states in the upper quadrupole guide, the excited state 

)0,1(

 will be lost due to spin flips [14], leaving the 

)0,0(

 population to be measured by 

fluorescence.  Second, the additional bias field  >,  can be rotated adiabatically from the 

xˆ  direction to  xˆ  before reducing its amplitude to zero, thereby transforming state 

)0,1(

 

into 

)1,0(

.  This leaves the output of the interferometer as a superposition of 

)0,0(

 and 

)1,0(

  in  the  harmonic  guide,  which  can  be  read  out  by  reducing  >   so  that  the 

)0,0(

 

component moves into the upper guide while the 

)1,0(

 part is transported downward. 

In an interferometer the statistical signal:noise ratio is proportional to the interaction 

time  J and to the square root of the number of atoms  N .  We can easily imagine 106 

atoms trapped in the waveguide with a measurement time of ~10 s, giving 

410NJ

.  

In comparison a macroscopic cold atom interferometer of the Kasevich-Chu type [17] has 

 

8

108  atoms  falling  through  the  apparatus  per  second  with  an  interaction  time  of  order 

30 ms, giving 

310NJ

 over the same 10s.  Both interferometers have a separation of 

~100 m between arms.  It therefore seems clear that this method of splitting the atoms in 

time,  rather  than  splitting  atoms  propagating  through  space,  can  significantly  advance 

some kinds of measurement.  For example, the new interferometer would be extremely 

sensitive to electric field gradients and to gravity.  Also, it would not suffer from phase 

shifts due to unwanted rotations because the Sagnac phase is zero. 

In conclusion, we have shown that two currents and a bias field form an exceedingly 

versatile structure, producing a waveguide that can be split in a highly controlled way and 

manipulated  on  the  sub-micron  scale.    We  have  shown  explicitly  how  a  novel  and 

sensitive atom interferometer could be realized with such a guide.  This structure is also 

ideal for a variety of topical applications including a miniature magneto-optical trap and 

the study of 1-dimensional quantum gases.  Finally, the quantum model of guided atom 

interferometry presented here will apply to many existing experiments once they reach 

the level of single-mode operation. 

We  are  indebted  to  David  Lau,  Stephen  Hopkins,  and  Mark  Kasevich  for  valuable 

discussions  and  to  Matthew  Jones  for  experimental  work  on  the  Sussex  microscopic 

guide.  This work was supported by the UK EPSRC and the EU.

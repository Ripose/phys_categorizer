Abstract 

A complete set of cross sections is reported for the ionization of water molecules by neutral 

atomic hydrogen impact at velocities of the order of the Bragg peak. The measured relative 

cross  sections  are  normalized  by  comparison  with  proton  impact  results  for  the  same  target 

conditions  and  previous  absolute  data.  Event  by  event  coincidence  analysis  of  the  product 

ions  and  the  projectile  enables  partial  cross  sections  for  target  ionization  and  target  plus 

projectile  ionization  to  be  determined,  as  well  as  total  cross  sections  for  electron  loss 

reactions.

It is widely accepted today that an understanding of the detailed structure of charged 

particle tracks is essential to elucidate and interpret the mechanistic consequences of energy 

deposition  by  ionizing  radiation  in  an  absorbing  medium  [1].  Concomitant  and  subsequent 

radiation  damage  in  the  medium  (biological  tissue)  depends  crucially  upon  the  evolution  of 

track  patterns  along  the  path  of  the  energetic  particle.  The  determination  of  these  patterns 

relies  on  a  broad  range  of  cross  section  data  for  the  primary  interactions  of  the  relevant 

particles with the molecular constituents of the absorbing medium [1-4]. 

A charged particle passing through an absorbing medium at high velocity loses kinetic 

energy  primarily  in  collisions  with  bound  electrons.  Subsequent  energy  loss  by  ejected 

(secondary)  electrons  and  chemical  reactions  involving  energized  atoms  and  molecules 

produce  the  track  structure  and  radiation  damage  [5].  As  the  charged  particle  slows  down, 

electron  capture  interactions  become  more  important  thereby  producing  fast  neutral 

projectiles. The interplay between these different processes, their energy dependences, and the 

possibility of switching the charge state of the projectile is responsible for the occurrence of 

the  Bragg  peak  in  irradiated  media  [6].  To  develop  track  structure  models,  both  electron 

capture  and  electron  loss  cross  sections  are  required  for  each  potential  charge  state  of  the 

moving  particle.  Whereas  these  cross  sections  are  available  for  proton  impact  ([7-13]  for 

water),  there  are  substantial  shortcomings  in  the  understanding  of  the  underlying  collision 

processes  for  neutral  hydrogen  atom  impact,  in  particular  upon  biologically  relevant 

molecular targets. 

The ionization of water molecules represents both a fundamental example in collision 

physics  [14]  and  a  subject  of  great  interest  in  various  areas  of  applied  physics  including 

radiation damage to biological tissue [15], the chemistry of planetary upper atmospheres [16],

and  the  ionization  balance  in  the  plasma  of  tokamak  fusion  devices  [17].  Today  it  is 

recognized that radiation damage to living material, in particular strand breaking in DNA, can 

occur  not  only  as  a  result  of  direct  particle-biomolecule  interactions  but  also  through 

processes  initiated  by  radical  species  released  by  the  fragmentation  of  neighboring  water 

molecules.  A  detailed  knowledge  of  the  relevant  ionization  processes  is  thus  essential  to 

achieve a full understanding of radiation damage to biological material on a microscopic level 

[18]. Information on the individual reactions is required: determination of average energy loss 

is not sufficient. 

In spite of this broad range of interest, cross section measurements for the ionization 

of  water  by  neutral  impact  are  extremely  scarce  and  a  number  of  decisive  details  have  not 

been  investigated.  In  1968  Toburen  et  al.  [8]  reported  the  first  total  electron  loss  cross 

sections  for  100-2500  keV  neutral  atomic  hydrogen  impact  on  H2O  using  the  equilibrium 

fraction method to analyze the multiple-charge-state beam at the exit of a gas cell. Dagnac et 

al. [19] extended these studies to energies between 2 and 60 keV. In 1986 Bolorizadeh  and 

Rudd  [20]  measured  doubly  differential  ionization  cross  sections  for  electron  production  in 

collisions between neutral  hydrogen atoms  and water molecules at 20-150  keV. The doubly 

differential  cross  sections  were  integrated  over  angle  and  energy  to  obtain  total  electron 

production  cross  sections.  As  the  previous  experiments  did  not  detect  the  ionized  target 

system,  important  information  on  the  ionizing  interaction  of  neutral  hydrogen  atoms  with 

water vapor is unavailable in the literature. 

The  present  work  features  the  application  of  an  experimental  system  which  enables 

atomic  hydrogen  impact  ionization  of  water  vapor  to  be  analyzed  in  great  detail  and  on  an 

event  by  event  basis.  Target  ion  signals  can  be  detected  in  coincidence  with  the  charge-

analyzed projectile to determine whether the ionizing collision of the hydrogen atom involves

charge transfer (electron loss) or not (no change in projectile charge state). The present study 

is possible due to the addition of a time of flight ion detector operated in coincidence with the 

existing  high-energy  ion  beam  /  multi-coincidence  apparatus  [7,21,22].  The  fate  of  the 

projectile  can  be  analyzed  in  coincidence  with  that  of  the  target  molecule  in  each  ionizing 

collision.  Thus,  for  the  first  time,  it  is  possible  to  obtain  not  only  total  ionization  cross 

sections for neutral particle impact but also cross sections that are ‘differential’ in terms of the 

ionization event (target ionization and/or projectile ionization). H2O is selected as the target 

due to its key role in radiation damage to biological tissue. 

The  apparatus  has  been  described  previously  [7].  However,  in  order  to  carry  out 

neutral  impact  experiments,  an  argon-filled  charge  transfer  cell  is  introduced  between  the 

magnetic  mass  selector  and  the  collision  cell.  Protons  are  thus  converted  into  neutral 

hydrogen atoms. Deflection plates situated in front of the collision cell serve to eliminate any 

residual  charged  projectiles.  This  electric  field  also  acts  as  a  quenching  field  for  metastable 

atoms  and  an  ionizing  field  for  Rydberg  atoms  [20].  For  each  single  collision  event,  the 

product ions produced in the target region are measured in coincidence with the charge of the 

projectile after the ionizing collision. The detected projectile may be a neutral H atom (target 

ionization),  a  proton  (target  plus  projectile  ionization),  or  an  H-  ion  (electron  capture).  The 

latter  process  is  found  to  be  negligible  in  the  present  study.  Each  neutral  impact  result  is 

accompanied by a proton impact measurement with identical target conditions. Relative cross 

sections  derived  from  the  measured  coincident  rates  are  thus  calibrated  using  recently 

measured  relative  and  absolute  proton  impact  results  [7-13].  The  maximum  errors  are 

estimated  at  25%  on  the  basis  of  the  reported  errors  in  the  absolute  data  used  for 

normalization  [11]  and  the  deviation  of  the  measured  relative  cross  sections  from  smooth 

fitted  relations.  The  increased  statistical  errors  associated  with  low  neutral  impact  cross 

section  events  at  low  impact  energies  are  diminished  by  correspondingly  high  normalizing

proton  impact  cross  sections  [7].  Naturally,  cross  sections  deduced  by  subtracting  directly 

measured cross sections are subject to greater percentage errors. 

Charge transfer cross sections are generally designated as σif where i is the initial and f 

the final charge state of the projectile. For example, σ01 corresponds to the total electron loss 

cross section for neutral hydrogen impact. However, a more refined nomenclature is required 

to incorporate the fate of the target. The present partial cross sections are designated as σii→ff 

where  the  first  and  second  i  correspond  to  the  initial  charge  state  of  the  projectile  and  the 

target, respectively. The first and second f stand for the respective final charge states of the 

projectile  and  the  target.  Thus  the  individual  processes  studied  in  the  present  work  are 

represented as: 

H  +  H2O  → σ00→01 → H + (the ionized target system) 

H  +  H2O  → σ00→11 → H+ + e- + (the ionized target system) 

H  +  H2O  → σ00→10 → H+ + e- + H2O

Reaction  (1)  is  called  target  ionization,  reaction  (2)  projectile  plus  target  ionization  or 

electron  loss  plus  target  ionization,  and  reaction  (3)  electron  loss  without  target  ionization. 

That  the  observed  electron  loss  events  are  due  to  interactions  with  water  molecules  is 

confirmed  by  the  negligible  detection  rate  of  proton  projectiles  when  the  neutral  hydrogen 

beam  is  tested  without  the  water  jet.  The  present  experiment  enables  the  cross  sections  for 

reactions  (1)  and  (2)  to  be  measured  directly  by  coincident  ion-projectile  detection.  In 

addition, the cross section for reaction (3) can be deduced using the total electron loss cross

sections σ01 (non-coincidence measurements carried out previously [8,19] and also here) and 

the equation: 

σ01  =  σ00→11  +  σ00→10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(4) 

Fig.1  shows  the  measured  total  electron  loss  cross  sections  σ01,  the  measured  target 

ionization  cross  sections  σ00→11,  and  the  cross  sections  for  electron  loss  without  target 

ionization σ00→10 obtained by subtracting σ00→11 from σ01. Only the present total electron loss 

cross sections σ01 (filled squares) can be compared with earlier determinations, i.e. the data of 

Dagnac et al. [19] (open squares) and that of Toburen et al. [8] (crossed squares). The present 

and previous measurements are good agreement, lying comfortably within the estimated error 

limits. The only exception to this agreement is the 100 eV point from [8] which appears to be 

systematically shifted to a lower cross section compared to the present study and that of [19]. 

Moreover,  it  is  now  possible  to  gain  a  deeper  insight  into  the  ionization  process  by 

looking  at  the  shape  of  the  individual  partial  cross  section  curves  σ00→11  and  σ00→10.  Fig.1 

shows  that  the  total  cross  section  σ01  is  dominated  by  reaction  (3)  at  low  energies,  while 

reactions  (2)  and  (3)  have  about  the  same  probability  at  50  -  70  keV.  At  higher  energies, 

reaction (3) is again the major reaction channel. 

Besides  reactions  involving  charge  transfer,  it  has  also  been  possible  to  measure  the 

cross section σ00→01 for reaction (1): target ionization without a change in the charge state of 

the projectile. This data is shown in Fig.2 and cannot be compared directly with any previous 

results. However, the present total cross sections (filled circles in Fig.2) can be compared with 

the work of Bolorazideh and Rudd [20] (open circles). The total cross section called σ+ in the 

7

present work  (corresponding only to the electrons produced  by the  ionization of the target), 

was  obtained  previously  by  subtracting  the  ELC  (electron  loss  to  the  continuum)  from  the 

total  electron  production  cross  section  (σ-)  and  described  as  the  total  cross  section  for 

ionization  of  the  target  [2].  Bolorazideh  and  Rudd  [20]  determined  the  total  electron 

production  cross  section  curve  by  integration  of  their  doubly  differential  electron  ejection 

cross  sections.  The  ELC  was  obtained  by  the  same  authors  by  taking  into  account  that  the 

electrons  released  from  the  projectile  appear  preferentially  in  the  forward  direction  and 

essentially with the velocity of the ionized projectile. Accordingly,  

σ+  =  σ-  - ELC  =  σ-  -  ( σ00→10  +  σ00→11 ) 

 

(5) 

As the total electron production cross section σ- can be written in terms of the individual cross

sections as shown below, 

σ-  =  σ00→01  +  2σ00→11  +  σ00→10 

 

σ+  =  σ00→01  +  σ00→11 

 

 

by inserting (6) into (5) for σ+ the following simple relationship is obtained 

Fig.2 shows σ00→01, σ00→11, and σ+. The errors on the previous values for σ+ are given as 20% 

[20]. Therefore, the measured σ+ agree with the previous work to within the estimated error 

limits except at the low and high extremes of the energy range of both sets of experiments.

The  present  absolute  values  can  also  be  compared  with  the  total  electron  production 

cross sections σ- reported by Bolorazideh and Rudd [20] and shown as open triangles in Fig.3. 

Using (5) we can rewrite equation (6) 

σ-  =  σ00→01+  σ00→11  +  σ00→11  +  σ00→10  =  σ+  +  σ01 

 

 

 

(8) 

thereby  expressing  σ-  in  terms  of  the  presently  determined  partial  cross  sections.  Thus  it  is 

unsurprising  that,  as  observed  for  σ+,  Fig.3  shows  the  presently  derived  values  for  σ-  and 

those measured by Bolorizadeh and Rudd [20] to lie within the estimated error limits except at 

the low and high extremes of the energy range. 

Finally,  it  is  instructive  to  compare  the  present  neutral  hydrogen  impact  results  with 

earlier data [7-13] for proton impact ionization of water. The cross sections for direct target 

ionization (without electron capture) by proton impact σ10→11 and for total target ionization by 

neutral  impact  σ+  are  approximately  equal  (maximum  of  5×10-16  cm2  at  65  and  80  keV, 

respectively).  Therefore,  the  high  total  target  ionization  cross  sections  at  lower  energies  for 

proton impact compared to neutral impact are due to the contribution of electron capture by 

the  projectile.  In  contrast,  the  cross  section  for  charge-state  change  (electron  loss)  by  the 

neutral  projectile  σ01  decreases  with  impact  energy  below  95  keV.  The  dependence  of  the 

cross sections for ionization processes upon changes in the projectile charge state is a crucial 

determinant for the track structure along the path of the particle and thus significantly affects 

the damage to the absorbing medium [2]. 

The  present  work  provides  the  first  results  recorded  on  an  event  by  event  basis  for 

atomic hydrogen impact ionization of water vapor. In addition to the determination of average 

9

cross sections, experiments of this kind can explicit the fluctuations of individual processes, 

thus  opening  the  possibility  for  theoretical  treatments  of  hydrogen  impact  ionization  in  a 

medium  which  go  beyond  the  presently  available  analytical  functions  [2,23].  In  the  present 

analysis the results provide, to the authors’ knowledge, the first complete set of cross sections 

for the ionization of a molecular target by neutral hydrogen impact including various total and 

partial cross sections, and, furthermore, differentiating between the direct ionization and the

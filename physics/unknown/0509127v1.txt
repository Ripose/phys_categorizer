ABSTRACT 

 

A study of the line shapes of hydrogen Balmer series lines in RF generated low 

pressure H2/He plasmas produced results suggesting a catalytic process between helium 

and  hydrogen  species  results  in  the  generation  of  ‘hot’  (ca.  28  eV)  atomic  hydrogen.  

Even far from the electrodes ‘hot’ atomic hydrogen was predominant in H2/He plasmas.  

Line  shapes,  relative  line  areas  of  cold  and  hot  atomic  hydrogen  (hot/cold>2.5),  were 

very  similar  for  areas  between  the  electrodes  and  far  from  the  electrodes  for  these 

plasmas.    In  contrast,  in  H2/Xe  only  ‘warm’  (<5  eV)  hydrogen  (warm/cold<1.0)  was 

found between the electrodes, and only cold hydrogen away from the electrodes. Earlier 

postulates  that  preferential  hydrogen  line  broadening  in  plasmas  results  from  the 

acceleration  of  ionic  hydrogen  in  the  vicinity  of  electrodes,  and  the  special  charge 

exchange  characteristics  of  Ar/H2

+  are  clearly  belied  by  the  present  results  that  show 

atomic hydrogen line shape are similar for H2/He plasmas throughout the relatively large 

cylindrical (14 cm ID x 36 cm length) cavity.

 INTRODUCTION 

 

Recently, [1-17] unique and dramatic Hα line broadening has been observed in a 

variety  of  laboratories  in  specific  mixed  gas  plasmas,  particularly  Ar/H2  plasmas, 

operated at low pressure (milli-Torr) and generated, with microwave and glow discharge 

systems.    It  is  universally  agreed  that  the  broadening  must  be  Doppler  broadening.  

Alternatives  sources  of  line  broadening  such  as  Stark  effect  and  instrument  broadening 

are easily eliminated as they cannot explain the magnitude of the observed broadening, 

nor are these alternative explanations consistent with the lack of broadening observed for 

species,  other  than  atomic  hydrogen,  found  in  the  plasma.    For  example,  the  electron 

density required for Stark broadening of the magnitude observed is orders of magnitude 

higher than the density of atoms in the systems studied.  In fact, in those cases in which 

charged particle density was measured, it was about four orders of magnitude less than 

the  neutral  density,  quite  consistent  with  expected  charge  species  densities.    This 

agreement  on  the  source  of  the  broadening  creates  a  conundrum  for  the  physics 

community.    To  wit:    How  can  one  neutral  species  in  a  mixed  gas  plasma  have  a 

temperature  of  approximately  300,000  K,  while  in  the  same  plasma  all  other  species, 

including electrons, have temperatures of less than 10,000 K?  

 

Indeed,  there  is  a  debate  regarding  the  mechanism  of  the  selective  heating  of 

atomic  hydrogen  in  these  plasmas.    One  class  of  mechanisms  can  be  called  field 

acceleration (FA) models because, in all the various permutations of this class of models, 

it is necessary for the energy to be given to the hydrogen from the field.  For example, it 

is postulated that ionic molecular hydrogen is accelerated in the cathode fall region, then 

is neutralized and picks up charge from Ar ions, and finally dissociates and emits [6-17].  

2 

To  explain  the  symmetric  broadening  observed  (both  red  and  blue  shift),  these  models 

require  that  an  ideal  reflector  must  be  present  (generally  postulated  to  be  an  electrode) 

that has unity elastic reflectivity of hot neutral H atoms, and in addition fully randomizes 

the direction of the reflected species.  As discussed later, these two requirements are in 

fact mutually exclusive. 

The alternative model [7, 18, 19] is based on a new paradigm of quantum physics, 

Classical  Quantum  Mechanics  (CQM).    This  paradigm,  applied  to  the  line  broadening 

phenomenon  [1-5],  postulates  that  the  energy  of  the  H  atoms  is  created  by  a  non-field, 

‘chemical’,  process,  that  leaves  at  least  one  hydrogen  atom  called  hydrino  in  a  ‘sub-

ground’ state.  Moreover, the process that produces the ‘sub ground state hydrogen’, and 

concomitantly  releases  the  energy  to  produce  super  heated  ‘standard’  atomic  hydrogen, 

requires  a  novel  ‘resonant  transfer’  interaction  between  hydrogen  atoms  and  particular 

atomic  catalysts,  including  Ar+,  He+,  O  and/or  previously  created  sub-ground  state 

hydrogen.  

The  role  of  experimental  physics  in  situations  such  as  that  described  above  is 

clear: Undertake programs that will produce distinctly different outcomes for competing 

hypotheses.    Indeed,  there  are  many  published  tests,  spectroscopic  [2,  18,  20-26], 

calorimetric  [27,  28],  NMR  [29],  etc.  that  indicate  the  CQM  theory  conforms  to 

experiment rather better than standard quantum theory.  Thus, there is a sound scientific 

basis  for  further  tests,  particularly  relating  to  the  ability  of  CQM  and  FA  models  to 

predict the outcomes of Balmer series line broadening in RF plasmas.  Specifically, this 

study  was  designed  to  create  dramatic  differences  in  predicted  outcomes  between  FA 

models and CQM hypotheses in an RF mixed H2/He gas plasma system.  

3 

Several tests of the two theories were included.  For example, line broadening was 

studied  throughout  the  volume  of  H2/He  plasmas,  and  not  just  in  the  high  field  region 

between the electrodes.  If any of the FA models are correct, then line broadening should 

not be observed in regions far from the high field region.  In contrast, the effect of field 

on  line  broadening  according  to  the  CQM  model  should  be  secondary.    That  is,  the 

intensity  of  the  broadening  might  be  lower  away  from  the  field,  but  the  magnitude  of 

broadening should be only marginally impacted.  Also, if the CQM hypothesis is correct, 

line  broadening  should  be  observed  as  readily  in  a  H2/He  mixture  as  it  is  in  an  H2/Ar 

mixture.    Also,  in  the  regions  away  from  reflector  surfaces  line  broadening  should  be 

asymmetric.    As  the  FA  models  indicated  that  Ar  has  an  unusually  large  x-section  for 

electron  transfer,  the  effect  in  a  helium  plasma  should  be  dramatically  reduced.    The 

experiments  were  successful,  in  that a simple summary is possible:  All outcomes were 

consistent with the predictions of CQM and inconsistent with all FA models.   

In  addition  to  providing  experimental  data  to  distinguish  between  two  theories, 

the  data  collected  are  of  intrinsic  significance.    Indeed,  H2/He  plasmas  are  among  the 

most common structures of matter in the universe.  If an interaction between these two 

gases in a plasma leads to the selective generation of extremely energetic hydrogen (not 

helium),  even  in  the  absence  of  a  field,  then  this  phenomenon  needs  to  be  thoroughly 

investigated.  

 
 

EXPERIMENTAL 

Plasma  Hardware-  All  plasmas  were  generated  in  a  GEC  cell  [30]  held  at  0.4 

Torr.    This  system  consists  of  a  large  cylindrical  (14  cm  ID  x  36  cm  length)  Pyrex 

4 

chamber containing two parallel steel circular (8.25 cm diameter) plates, placed about 1 

cm  apart  at  the  center  (Figure  1a).    RF  power  from  a  RF  VII,  Model  RF  5  13.6  MHz 

power supply was sent to the plates through 8 mm diameter steel feeds, which entered the 

chamber  through  standard  Ultratorr  fittings,  one  on  each  end  of  the  chamber.    Gases, 

UHP grade (99.999%) He, H2 and Xe, were metered into the chamber through Ultratorr 

fittings  at  one  end,  about  18  cm  from  the  electrodes,  using  two  mass  flow  controllers 

(MKS).    The  chamber  was  pumped  using  a  Welch  two  stage  rotary  vane  oil  sealed 

vacuum pump (Model 8920) with a rated capacity of 218 l/min.  This pump was attached 

to  the  chamber  with  a  1  cm  ID  Ultratorr  fitting  at  the  end  opposite  that  at  which  gas 

entered.  Pressure was measured with an MKS Baratron gauge place between the pump 

and the plasma chamber.  All RF components of the system (chamber, power supply, and 

controller) were kept inside a copper mesh Faraday cage.  All inner surfaces were painted 

black. 

A  precise  mapping  of  the  plasma  was  made  possible  by  the  use  of  a  patterned 

light fiber holder placed directly above the plasma chamber, 35 cm X 15 cm in size, with 

drilled  0.2  cm  in  diameter  holes  one  centimeter  apart  in  a  square  pattern  (Figure  1b).  

Positions listed below are relative to the (0,0) hole, which is the hole just above the center 

of the electrodes/center of the chamber.  Thus for example, (-5, -4) is 5 cm ‘behind’ the 

electrodes and to the left, that is between the electrodes and the gas input and 4 cm to the 

left when the chamber is viewed from the gas exit port.  In all cases, in which the light 

fiber was employed in the matrix, it was oriented vertically as shown in Figure 1b. 

Spectrometer-  The  spectrometer  system  used  in  this  study,  described  in  detail 

elsewhere [31], is built around a 1.25 m visible light instrument from Jvon-Spex with a 

5 

holographic ruled diffraction grating (1800 g mm-1), with a nearly flat response between 

300 and 900 nm.  The slit was set at 10 μm in most cases.  Light was collected using a 

light  fiber  bundle  consisting  of  19  fibers,  each  of  200  μm  diameter.    It  is  important  to 

note that tests with a red laser with the system open clearly showed that light emanating 

from the region between the plates could not have reached the ‘hooded’ fiber optic probe 

when  it  was  positioned  at  either  end.  Indeed,  our  tests  showed  that  the  readings  are 

consistent with the listed 9° acceptance angle given with the probe.  That angle indicates 

that a 1 cm diameter ‘spot’ would be encompassed by the acceptance cone even at the far 

side of the plasma cylinder from the probe. 

In  most  cases,  data  was  collected  for  the  same  time  period,  10  one  minute 

intervals.  The repeat collection of data over the same spectral interval permits the system 

software  to  systematically  eliminate  ‘noise  spikes’  by  eliminating  data  ‘points’  that  do 

not appear repeatedly.  Thus, relative intensities in the figures provide very quantifiable 

comparison of the relative concentrations of excited hydrogen at any one collection point 

under different conditions (e.g. H2/He ratios).  They also provide a reasonable basis for a 

semi-quantitative  comparison  between  excited  H-populations  at  different  collection 

points.    Balmer  series  spectral  lines  were  fit  using  two  Gaussians,  one  for  the  fast 

hydrogen, and the second for the slow hydrogen using a procedure described elsewhere 

[31].  It is notable that the fittings achieved were excellent (R2>0.97 in all cases). 

 

RESULTS 

The primary result of this work is the finding that in low pressure (< 0.4 Torr) RF 

generated H2/He plasmas, in regions far from the strong field generated at the center of 

6 

the  electrodes,  there  is  significant  Doppler  line  broadening,  indicating  the  dominance 

(Hot/Cold >2.5, Table I) of ‘hot’ hydrogen  (> 20 eV) throughout the chamber.  There is 

virtually  no  line  broadening  of  the  helium  lines  in  these  plasmas.    These  are  the  key 

findings consistent with the CQM predictions and contrary to the FA model predictions.  

Other  findings  that  are  apparently  more  consistent  with  the  ‘chemical  process’  CQM 

model are: (i) In H2/Xe plasmas operated below 1 Torr, only cold hydrogen was found in 

regions  away  from  the  electrode,  and  only  between  the  electrodes  is  there  evidence  of 

very small fraction of energetic, in this case ‘warm’ (<5 eV), hydrogen atoms (warm/cold 

<1.0).  (ii)  No  line  broadening  of  any  species  was  found  when  the  operating  pressure 

exceeded 1.0 Torr. (iii) All of the Balmer lines are broadened to approximately the same 

energy.  (iv)  The  impact  of  absorbed  power  and  voltage  on  the  magnitude  of  the  line 

broadening was negligible. (v) The plasma is not symmetric. (vi) The relative intensity of 

the Balmer lines is not impacted by the position of the ‘hot’ electrode.  In contrast, it is 

impacted by the position of the gas entry point.    

In Figures 2a and 2b, a series of Balmer series lines collected at the gas exit end 

of the plasma system  (Collection  Point (15,3)) and from between the plates (Collection 

Point  (0,0))  are  shown  for  H2/He  plasmas  with  different  H2/He  ratios  for  the  656.3  nm 

Balmer line (Hα).  The data in Table I confirms what is apparent upon inspection of this 

figure: the magnitude of the broadening is virtually the same at all collection locations.  

As  shown  in  Figure  2c,  upon  substituting  He  for  Xe,  there  is  no  hot  hydrogen  found 

anywhere in the system, although at high hydrogen concentration (H2/Xe>4) a relatively 

small fraction of the hydrogen between the plates is ‘warm’.  At lower ratios only cold 

hydrogen is present consistent with previous explanations [1,4]. 

7 

In Figure 3 - data taken about 2cm inward from the right ‘edge’ of the GEC cell: 

Collection  Points  (X,  5),    it  is  shown  that  at  high  power  (>150  W)  the  plasma  is  not 

symmetric.    Indeed,  the  concentration  of  hot  hydrogen  is  always  higher  near  the  gas 

entrance than at the pump end of the system.  Reversing the ‘ground’ and ‘hot’ electrodes 

has no apparent impact.  It is also clear that the magnitude of broadening is not a function 

of  position  along  the  axis,  which  is  a  clear  indication  that  it  is  also  not  a  function  of 

electric field. 

The tabulated data also makes it clear that the broadening is a function of many 

factors, but does not correlate with field strength.  For example, the data in Table I make 

it clear that the broadening is a function of the ratio of helium and hydrogen.  The data in 

this  table  also  shows  that  the  replacement  of  helium  with  xenon  completely  removes 

significant  broadening,  per  Figure  2c.    Table  III  data  indicates  that  the  strongest 

broadening  is  not  always  found  in  the  highest  field  region,  and  also  shows  that  the 

magnitude  of  the  broadening  is  not  a  function  of  applied  voltage.    Indeed,  the  hottest 

hydrogen was recorded at 100 W, not at 150 W. 

In  Figure  4,  spectra  for  another  Balmer  line  (Hβ),  are  shown  for  H2/He  plasmas 

from  both  ends  of  the  system.    This  and  other  data  (Table  I)  confirms  an  impression 

gained from visual inspection that the system is not symmetric.  Also, from both figures it 

is  clear  that  the  Balmer  lines  for  H2/He  plasmas  actually  consist  of  two  parts,  a  broad 

base (‘fast’ hydrogen) and a sharp top (‘slow’ hydrogen). 

This  ‘dual  component’  structure  of  the  Balmer  lines  is  not  consistent  with 

anything but Doppler broadening.  Clearly it is not consistent with Stark broadening as 

that  would  affect  all  of  the  hydrogen,  as  well  as  the  helium.    Helium  lines  were 

8 

consistently  only  about  0.01  nm  in  half  width,  or  about  equal  to  the  instrument  line 

broadening. Measurements of H2/Xe plasmas produced only narrow Balmer series lines 

(<2.5 eV) away from the electrodes.  Another interesting feature: The intensity increased 

with  increases  in  the  H2/Xe  ratio,  clearly  opposite  to  the  trend  observed  in  H2/He 

plasmas.  Only between the electrodes in H2/Xe mixtures there is some warm hydrogen, 

up  to  50%  in  one  case,  whereas  in  H2/He  plasmas  the  hot  hydrogen  is  the  dominant 

variety throughout the chamber. 

Note  (Table  I  and  III)  that  the  temperature  of  the  ‘hot’  atomic  hydrogen, 

determined from the Hα line width, is up to nearly 40 eV (i.e. Tmax > 400,000 K) at all 

locations.  This is far greater than the ‘temperature’ (Texe) of the atomic hydrogen (either 

the  ‘cold’  or  the  ‘hot’)  determined  from  a  fit  of  the  relative  intensities  using  the 

Boltzmann method  (approx. 0.5 eV or 5,000 K, determined at Position (15, -3), system 

operated  at  100  W,  with  four  Balmer  lines).    Moreover,  in  RF  plasmas  the  excitation 

temperature is generally considered equal to the electron temperature; thus, the measured 

value of the atomic hydrogen is almost two orders of magnitude greater than that of the 

electrons [32-34].   

The  FA  models  also  imply  a  relationship  should  exist  between  RF  voltage  and 

measured magnitude of line broadening.  In order to probe this potential relationship the 

voltage/power relation was measured, as shown in Figure 6.  Clearly the voltage between 

electrodes  increases  almost  three  times  faster  than  the  applied  power  in  the  region  of 

interest, 40-150 W.  Yet, no concomitant change in line broadening was discernable.  In 

fact,  as  noted  before,  the  greatest  broadening  was  found  at  100W  input  power,  not  at 

150W.

DISCUSSION 

Many  groups  report  (anomalous)  line  broadening  of  atomic  hydrogen  lines  in 

mixed gas plasmas containing argon in high field regions [6-17].  A similar phenomenon 

has been observed in pure hydrogen plasmas, generated with DC discharge or RF systems 

including one group using a GEC cell [4, 7, 17].  These results repeatedly raise the same 

question: how can a plasma be created in which one particular neutral species is so much 

hotter than all other neutral species as well as so much hotter than the charged species?   

Below  we  argue  that  (i)  all  the  existing  standard  physics  models  (FA  models)  fail  to 

explain the data presented above, as well as other data available in the literature on this 

topic, and (ii) in contrast the CQM model is consistent with all observations.  

Field  Acceleration  Models  -  As  noted  in  the  Introduction,  all  the  FA  models 

require that hot atomic hydrogen obtains its energy, directly or indirectly, from the field 

[12, 13].  For instance, in some models (gas phase production versions) the hot hydrogen 

is produced when a hydrogen ion, for example, 

+

3H  [10], increased in concentration by 

interactions with Ar, is accelerated by the field toward an electrode, captures an electron 

via interaction with an Ar, electron dissociates to form n=3 state hydrogen, or forms n=3 

state hydrogen via collision with a neutral Ar, and then emits.  The possibility that the hot 

hydrogen forms from collisions with hot gas species (ions or atoms) is dismissed for two 

reasons.    First,  the  cross  sections  for  collisions  with  H  ions  are  too  small;  second 

spectroscopy indicates there is little or no hot argon of any form present [7].  There are 

also  models  (surface  production  versions)  in  which  the  most  energetic  hydrogen  atoms 

gain energy by 'bombardment' of hydrogen species on electrode surfaces with energized 

10 

ions,  generally 

+
3H , 

+

2H   or  H+  ions  [6,7],  and  the  subsequent  ejection  of  hot  hydrogen 

atoms [7].  

In  all  cases,  these  gas  production  models  only  predict  selective  hydrogen 

broadening in high field regions, not throughout a large plasma chamber. Hot hydrogen 

ions created near the electrodes, the only region with sufficient field strength to accelerate 

ions  to  the  measured  energy  levels,  simply  cannot  migrate  15  cm  without  equilibrating 

with  the  system,  even  given  a  maximum  computation  of  the  mean  free  path  of  the  hot 

hydrogen  in  a  300  mTorr  system  at  5000  K  is  about  0.5  cm.  Moreover,  these  models 

require that the 'parent' species of the emitting H are hot ions.  In this case, the excitation 

temperature, certainly after diffusing 15 cm, would be in equilibrium with the translation 

temperature, and would also be very high (i.e. >300,000 K); whereas, it was found to be 

only  5,000  K.    Thus,  any  relevant  model  must  account  for  a  process  that  generates  hot 

hydrogen atoms far from strong field regions.  Indeed, the fields found 15 cm from the 

electrode  are  not  nearly  as  strong  as  those  found  in  the  boundary  layer  near  the 

electrodes.    Field  screening  by  the  sheath  reduces  the  fields  dramatically  within 

millimeters, and a highly conductive plasma bulk is essentially equipotential [7]. 

Another  difficulty  for  the  FA-gas  models  posed  by  the  present  results  is  the 

absence of argon in the present study.  An 'adjusted' model would require that helium is 

also  particularly  good  at  generating  hydrogen  ions,  and  that  there  is  rapid  charge 

exchange  between  He,  or  some  He  ions,  and 

+

2H .    Also,  the  evidence  of  relative 

populations  clearly  indicates  no  preferential  population  of  n=3  states,  contrary  to  the 

predictions of the FA gas models.  

11 

The ‘distance’ objection given to the FA-gas models also applies as an objection 

to  the  ‘surface  model’  variations  of  the  FA  models.    That  is,  these  models  are  also 

inherently  inconsistent  with  the  observation of hot hydrogen many centimeters from an 

electrode  surface.    In  this  model  class,  hot  H  is  presumably  formed  when  high  energy, 

field accelerated ions, generally 

+
3H , 

+

2H  or H+ ions [6, 7] bombard an electrode surface 

rich in absorbed hydrogen, leading to the subsequent ejection of hot hydrogen atoms [14]. 

That  is,  energetic  hydrogen  created  by  electrode  bombardment  should  only  exist  in  a 

region of a few millimeters above the electrode, a region concurrent with the cathode fall 

region  [7].    This  result  is  to  be  expected  as  any  ‘hot’  species  will  equilibrate,  via 

collisions with other species, at a distance of no more than a few mean free paths of its 

creation point.  Others suggest that surface generated hot hydrogen atoms are associated 

with a very broad peak, requiring the fitting of the overall line with three Gaussians [14].  

This was not necessary in the present case (Figure 5).  

Another major difficulty with any of the FA models is the fact that experiments 

universally  show  that  viewed  from  any  angle,  the  Balmer  lines  are  symmetrically 

broadened.    Moreover,  there  is  no  difference  in  the  magnitude  of  the  broadening  as  a 

function  of  the  direction  of  the  observation  relative  to  the  applied  field.      Thus,  these 

models  inherently  require  ideal  reflectors  that  not  only  elastically  scatter  with  perfect 

efficiency,  but  also  reflectors  that  ideally  scatter  in  all  directions.  Only  such  an  ideal 

reflector could explain the remarkably even extent of blue and red shifts. (Yet, the two 

requirements are mutually exclusive, as discussed below.) This is generally recognized in 

the FA models, and often the electrodes are assigned these ideal properties.   

12 

Yet  the  two  requirements  of  this  proposed  scattering  process,  perfect  efficiency 

and  ‘randomization’  of  direction  are  mutually  exclusive.  Elastic  collisions  will  not 

distribute the excess momentum, which is generated only in the direction of the applied 

field  axis,  in  other  directions,  and  only  elastic  collisions  can  create  a  symmetric 

broadening.    Any  inelastic  processes  would  result  in  ‘red  shift’,  not  blue,  and  hence 

‘randomization’  processes  should  yield  an  asymmetric  broadened  peak.    Moreover,  the 

magnitude of broadening will decrease with each inelastic event.  Thus, if inelastic events 

occur  away  from  the  electrode,  as  sometimes  is  suggested  [17],  they  would  produce 

steadily diminished broadening as a function of distance from the electrode.  Clearly, this 

is not observed. 

Standard  Physics  Alternatives-  One  alternative  to  the  FA  model  that  has  been 

mentioned, but hardly developed, is the transfer of electron energy from electrons in the 

high end of the EEDF directly to the translational energy mode of atomic hydrogen [17].  

This  is  clearly  implausible  as  electron  temperature  is  known  to  strongly  couple  to  the 

atomic excitation temperature, and very weakly to translation temperature [35].  Thus, the 

measurement of excitation temperature in this study and in others of about 0.5 eV, is not 

consistent  with  electrons  generating  a  translational  motion  temperature  (of  only  one 

species!) almost two orders of magnitude greater than the excitation temperature. 

Other conventional physics explanations for the observed line broadening also do 

not  fit  the  values  measured.  For  example,  optical  thickness  cannot  be  a  factor.  

Specifically, for optically thin plasmas (self adsorption not significant), the effective path 

length τω L( ) is less than one: 

 

τω L( ) = σωN H L < 1 

(1) 

13 

where σω   is the absorption cross section,  NH  is the number density, and  L  is the plasma 

path length traversed by the light.  The absorption cross section for Balmer α emission is 

σ= 1 X 10 −16  cm2   [36].    An  upper  limit  on  the  excited  Hα  density,  assuming  all  of  the 

hydrogen is fully dissociated, the temperature (as measured) is 5000 K, and, the excited 

states  are  populated  according  to  the  Boltzmann  distribution  (as  measured),  is  106/cm3.  

No more than 15 cm of plasma is traversed. These values indicate an effective path length 

of 10-8, clearly the plasma is optically thin for Hα, a result consistent with the observation 

that  the  Balmer  α  line  is  composed  of  both  Doppler  broadened  and  unbroadened 

components.  A  line  broadened  by  self  absorption  would  have  only  a  single  broad 

component. Stark broadening can also be eliminated.  The required electron densities are 

orders of magnitude greater than the gas densities.  Moreover, the lines are composed of 

hot  and  cold  components.    All  H  atoms,  not  just  a  fraction,  as  well  as  other  species, 

would be impacted by high charge densities. 

Even the Frank–Condon effect was considered.  The ‘Frank-Condon’ effect [37-

39] will create ‘hot’ neutrals with energies between 2 and 4.5eV via wall reactions of the

Clearly, the energy of neutral species created in this fashion do not match the energies of 

the neutrals observed in this study. 

One  similarity  between  the  results  obtained  here  and  earlier  studies  of  H2/Ar 

plasmas was the magnitude of the Hα broadening.  In our case, for the strongest signal 

(H2/He  =  1x10-5)  the  measured  broadening  was  29  +/-  3eV,  very  close  to  the  value 

recorded for H2/Ar, which, for example, was more than 28 eV in recent studies [7, 17].    

14 

The results obtained in this study strongly imply that the energy required to create 

the Doppler broadening results from some form of catalytic process, involving a helium 

and hydrogen species, and not a process that requires energy absorption from the field, or 

field  accelerated  ion  surface  bombardment  of  electrodes,  to  produce  hot  H-atoms.    The 

amount of energy released by the catalytic process must be remarkably high as more than 

25  eV  of  energy  is  absorbed  by  the  hot  H  atoms, far higher than the amount of energy 

generated (<1 eV/H atom) when water is formed from molecular hydrogen and oxygen.  

Classical  Quantum  Mechanics  (CQM)  -  The  above  requirements,  based  on 

observation  made  in  this  and  other  studies,  are  not  consistent  with  the  FA  models,  but 

they are consistent with the CQM model.  In brief, the CQM model, based exclusively on 

Maxwell’s  equations  and  Newton’s  Laws,  which  includes  the  novel  postulate  that  the 

electron as well as all other fundamental particles are three dimensional physical objects 

of  precise  shape,  that  follow  classical  physical  laws,  includes  testable  predictions  of 

relevance  to  the  current  work.    Specifically,  it  is  postulated  that  the  electron  in  the 

hydrogen  atoms  can  undergo  a  transition  from  the  ‘traditional’  ground  state  (principle 

quantum number, n=1) to a fractional quantum states called hydrinos with an energy far 

lower than that of the hydrogen that enters the reactor (e.g. n = 1 for which E = –13.6eV 

vs. n = 1/2, for which E = –54.4eV).  These ‘chemical’ transitions of atomic hydrogen to 

stable states, can only take place due to the action of specific catalytic species, including 

Ar+  and  He+.    In  this  work,  He+  is  clearly  present  in  the  plasma.    In  earlier  line 

broadening studies, Ar+ can be assumed to have been present.  Also consistent with the 

theory  is  the  finding  that  in  those  cases  in  which  both  Ar  and  He  were  excluded  (i.e. 

Xe/H2 plasmas) no anomalous Balmer line broadening was observed. 

15 

 

The  CQM  model  is  also  completely  consistent  with  several  other  significant 

observations  that  pose  difficulties  for  the  FA  model  family.    First,  as  the  process  that 

creates  the  excess  energy  is  chemical,  and  not  directly  electric  field  driven,  the  hot  H 

atoms produced should travel with equal likelihood in all directions.  This will create a 

symmetric,  Gaussian  broadening,  independent  of  direction  of  observation,  as  recorded 

herein.  Second,  also  consistent  with  observation,  the  magnitude  of  the  measured 

broadening  should  not  correlate  with  applied  field.    Third,  as  the  postulated  process  is 

chemical,  the  nature  of  the  broadening  should  be  the  same  everywhere.    That  is,  there 

should be no clear trend, such as diminished magnitude of broadening with distance from 

the electrode.  Again, observation is consistent with the predictions of the model. 

In addition to the published spectroscopic studies cited above that are consistent 

with this model, it is noteworthy that calorimetric studies show that microwave generated 

H2/He plasmas produce, for the same power input, approximately 50% more energy in a 

water bath than H2/Xe plasmas generated with the same device under the same conditions 

of pressure, flow, etc. [27, 28].  

It is important to note that in addition to the data presented here, there are several 

studies of plasma behavior designed to contrast FA model and CQM predictions that all 

clearly  show  the  inadequacy  of  the  FA  models.    For  example,  we  also  showed  that  in 

H2/Ar  plasmas  produced  in  the  same  GEC  cell,  hot  hydrogen  is  found  throughout  the 

chamber  [40].    It  has  also  been  shown  previously  that  selective  heating  of  hydrogen 

atoms  is  found  in  a  number  of  plasmas  in  which  argon  is  not  present  [1,  3-5,  20-24]. 

Perhaps  most  compelling  is  a  study  showing  that  the  phenomenon  can  be  found  in 

16 

microwave-generated plasmas [24].  Field acceleration of ions, a requirement of the FA 

models, is not possible in microwave systems. Thus, the present data is consistent with 

that  of  several  studies  showing  broadening  in  regions  of  plasmas  that  the  FA  models 

would  predict  no  broadening.    The  mechanism  of  chemical  transitions  of  atomic 

hydrogen will follow. 

Mechanism  of  chemical  transitions  of  atomic  hydrogen  by  CQM  -  The  average 

energy  of  the  fast  H,  according  to  CQM,  depends  on  the  particular  catalyst  (resonant 

transfer  or  RT  catalyst)  as  well  as  the  conditions  of  the  reaction.  That  is,  as  discussed 

below, the CQM theory indicates there are a number of processes that yield hot H atoms, 

with a range of energies.  The average energy observed is a function of the relative rates 

of these processes, which occur in parallel and in series with each other.  The rates of the 

individual processes are a function of catalyst identity and concentration, reaction cross 

sections, local (both time and space) concentrations of hydrinos, H atoms, etc. Below we 

provide an outline of the types of reactions which may occur, but it is not an exhaustive 

list.  Also, no kinetic modeling was conducted, as that will require actual rate constants, 

as yet unavailable.  

Below  we  develop  a  mechanism  for  selective  heating  of  hydrogen,  which  is  a 

application of earlier CQM mechanisms developed by R. Mills for H2/Ar [40] and pure 

H2O  plasmas  [23].    According  to  the  theory  the  helium  plasma  will  initially  (prior  to 

build  up  of  hydrino  species)  be  dominated  by  an  interaction  between  He+  ions  (the  RT 

catalyst)  and  H  atoms.    The  ionization  of  He+  is  approximately  54.4  eV  and  hence 

provides a net enthalpy of about 2, times Vh (the potential energy of H being 27.2 eV or 

one hartree) and that qualifies it to be a catalytic species according to CQM.  Specifically:  

17 

H(aH) + He+ → He++ + H*( aH/3) + 54.4 eV 

(3) 

 

 

where  H(aH)  is  a  ‘ground  state’  hydrogen  atom  as  conventionally  understood,  and 

H*(aH/3)  is  a  ‘metastable’  form  of  a  H(aH/3)  hydrino.    H(aH/3)  is    a    stable  hydrino 

(shrunken atomic hydrogen) with a diameter 1/3 that of H(aH), and H(aH) has a radius of 

one Bohr radius. 

This proposed reaction meets the postulated catalytic requirements of CQM.  To 

wit: the process affecting the catalytic agent (i.e. ionization of the He ion) requires 2 × 

27.2 eV which for this case is approximately half the energy of the transition (54.4 eV, 

per reaction (3)) to the lower (smaller) state of the hydrogen electron (108.8 eV).  Hence, 

the  postulated  catalytic  processes  invariably  create  metastable  hydrino  species  with  a 

large ‘excess’ of energy.  In particular, the metastable form of hydrino created in reaction 

(3)  carries  54.4  eV  of  ‘excess’  energy.    This  is  quickly  lost  via  one  of  the  following 

H*( aH /3) → H(aH /3) + hν 

reactions:  

 

 

or 

H*( aH /3) + H(aH) → Fast H(aH /3) + Fast H(aH). 

The former will create a 54.4 eV photon and the latter a fast hydrogen with a translational 

energy of 27.7 eV.  Why is the fast photon emitted with twice the energy transferred to 

the atomic hydrogen?  The reaction must conserve linear momentum. As written (eq. 5) 

both  species  enter  the  process  with  virtually  no  momentum,  and  thus  must  leave  the 

reaction point with equal and opposite momentum.  As both species have the same mass, 

they must also leave with equal energy.  

 (4) 

 (5) 

18 

  

It is interesting to note that without exception the data from the GEC shows that 

ALL of the energy absorbed by the H(aH) is absorbed as  translational as predicted.  That 

is, the proposed process as written is consistent with the observation that the excitation 

temperature  of  the  hot  H  atoms  observed  is  orders  of  magnitude  lower  than  the 

translational energy.  

with another:  

Other  processes  that  produce  fast  H  atoms  involve  the  reaction  of  one  hydrino 

H(aH/3) + H(aH/3) → H(aH/2) + H( aH/4) + 27.2 eV 

(6) 

Where  the  27.2  eV  can  either  be  given  off  as  kinetic  energy  (e.g.  reaction  (5))  or  as  a 

photon (reaction (4)).  The above reaction is representative of a set of processes termed 

‘disproportionation’  [21,  27,  41].    These  reactions  are  anticipated  in  the  CQM  as  the 

hydrinos themselves have appropriate ‘energy holes’ to act as catalytic agents.  Clearly 

starting  with  any  set  of  hydrinos,  produced  catalytically  per  reactions  such  as  Reaction 

(3), it is anticipated that lower energy state hydrinos, down to the lowest state (H(1/137)), 

can  be  produced  via  disproportionation  processes.    Each  step  ‘down’  to  a  smaller 

(literally)  hydrogen  species  releases  more  energy,  thus,  the  amount  of  energy  available 

for  creating  high  kinetic  energy  hydrogen  atoms  gets  very  large.    Clearly,  the  relative 

concentrations of different hydrino species will change with time, and this can change the 

average energy observed.  The hydrino concentration can also be expected to be position 

dependent.    For  example,  detailed  modeling  might  be  used  to  test  the  postulate  that 

hydrino concentration is highest at the pump end of the GEC cell.    

Another  set  of  processes  involving  two  reacting  hydrinos,  can  create  hydrogen 

atoms. For example: 

19 

 

H(aH/3) + H(aH/2) → H(aH) + H(aH/4) + 54.4 eV 

(7) 

It  is  possible  that  the  metastable  hydrino  decomposes  quickly  enough  that  the 

H(aH)  produced  in  reaction  (7)  absorbs  27.2  eV  of  kinetic  energy.    Moreover,  if  the 

plasma  contains  a  high  density  of  ‘hot’  hydrinos,  likely  given  the  metastable 

decomposition  processes  posited  (e.g.  reaction  (6)),  hydrino/hydrino  reactions  (e.g. 

reaction (7)) will create metastables of very high energies that upon collisional decay can 

produce  atomic  hydrogen  with  translational  energies  far  higher  than  27  eV.    Such 

reactions can readily produce H atoms with both low (ca. 10 eV) and high energies. 

On the basis of observation we offer a three-part answer to the question of why 

there  is  an  obvious  preference  for  the  production  of  hot  H  atoms  and  not  hot  helium.  

First,  the  cross  section  for  metastable  decay  to  produce  hot  species  via  ‘collision’  with 

H(aH) is much higher than that with any other species.  The experimental evidence clearly 

indicates  the  reaction,  with  H  atoms  is  dominant.    Possibly  the  cross  section  for 

metastable decay via conversion of energy to translational energy is only significant for 

this  type  of  H*–H  collisions.    Collisions  of  the  metastable  with  all  other  species,  we 

suggest,  would  be  unfavorable,  and  the  drop  in  energy  to  the  true  stable  state  in  the 

absence  of  atomic  hydrogen  will  be  via  photon  emission.    Second,  energy-transferring 

collisions between metastables and heavier species, with a concomitant drop in energy to 

the stable state, even if they do occur, will not produce a ‘visible’ effect.  In a collision 

with a 27 eV hydrino, a He atom would absorb at most 5.5 eV.  Moreover, the increase in 

velocity of species, and hence the relative change in line width goes as the square root of 

the mass ratio.  Thus, relative to hydrogen, the absolute increase in line width of helium 

(assuming the same emission frequency) is only one-half.  Thus, the net line broadening 

20 

for He, even in the very unlikely event that the fraction of helium ‘heated’ by collision 

with  metastable  species  was  equal  to  that  of  H  atoms,  would  be  equivalent  to  the  line 

broadening observed for 2.5 eV hydrogen.  In all likelihood (see Reason 1, above) a tiny 

fraction of the He is heated in this way and hence the signal from this heating is lost in 

the  averaging  process.    Third,  inelastic  collisions  would  not  produce  visible  results.  

‘Superheating’ of internal modes, such as electron excitation, would only be found in the 

EUV spectra, and hence could not be found with our system. 

Direct (not photon mediated) transfer of energy from metastable species to atomic 

species  is  not  a  postulate  unique  to  CQM  theory,  hence  using  the  postulate  herein  is 

consistent  with  the  general  understanding  of  plasma  physics  at  this  time  for  another 

system,  excimer  H  energy  transfer.    Selective  and  direct  transfer  of  energy  from 

metastable-noble-gase dimers (helium or neon) to hydrogen atoms to form excited gases 

[42-44] is suggested to explain several observations in these mixed gas systems.  No line 

broadening is observed, and the ‘resonant energy transfer’ of energy is needed to explain 

clear  evidence  of  selective  excitation  of  one  electronic  transition  in  the  hydrogen.    For 

example,  near  atmospheric  pressure  admixture  of  Ne  with  very  low  hydrogen 

concentrations,  excited  with  ionizing  particle  beams,  results  in  very  intense  Lyman  α 

radiation, with no concomitant Balmer lines, etc. [42].  This suggests a 10.2 eV resonant 

energy  transfer  from  excited 

2Ne   to  H  atoms,  with  the  dominant  cross-section  for  this 

*

particular process.  As discussed in these reports, the excitations observed are at the far 

end of what is energetically possible.  The observations in this report of hydrogen kinetic 

energies  in  excess  of  30  eV  are  far  outside  the  energy  range  achievable  via  the 

‘metastable noble gas to hydrogen’ mechanism.  

21 

 

SUMMARY 

The experiments conducted in this work were designed to distinguish two models 

of  the  widely  reported  selective  superheating  of  H  atoms  in  mixed  gas,  RF  generated, 

plasmas. The experimental design was found adequate for that purpose.  Specifically, the 

findings that (i) super heating of the atomic hydrogen is found in a H2/He plasma, (ii) the 

magnitude  of  the  heating  is  virtually  unchanged  throughout  a  large  GEC  cell,  (iii)  the 

heating  is  not  correlated  to  the  field  strength  between  the  electrodes,  or  local  field 

strength,  (iv)  only  the  translational  energy  mode  is  superheated  (i.e.  not  the  excitation 

energy), (v) the electrons are orders of magnitude cooler than the neutral H atoms, and 

(vi) the line broadening is symmetrical, independent of direction relative to the electric 

field direction  are all totally inconsistent with the FA models and totally consistent with 

the  predictions  of  the  CQM  model.        In  addition  to  the  theoretical  implications,  the 

experimental  results  alone  raise  questions  regarding  processes  taking  place  in  gaseous 

H2/He  plasmas,  one  of  the  most  common  forms  of  matter  in  the  universe  (e.g.  solar 

corona).

Figure Captions 

Figure  1.    GEC  System.    (a)  Schematic  of  GEC  cell.    This  entire  cell  is  enclosed  in  a 

copper Faraday cage which is painted black.  (b) A picture of the ‘grid’ employed to hold 

the fiber optic probe.  In the picture the probe is placed at Position (0,0). 

Figure 2.  Balmer series Hα line broadening. This figure shows how the lines broadening 

changes as a function of position, H2/He ratio and gas mixture. (a) Broadening measured 

at  Position  (-15,3)  for  H2/He  mixture;  (b)  Broadening  measured  at  Position  (0,0)  for 

H2/He mixture; (c) Substituting Xe for He removed virtually all line broadening of the Hα 

lines  away  from  the  electrodes.  Even  between  the  electrodes,  broadening  was  only 

measurable at high H2/Xe ratios (>4) and even then, significantly less than that observed 

for He/H2 mixtures. 

Figure  3.    Hα  Broadening  Mapped  along  a  Longitudinal  Axis  2cm  Inward  from  GEC 

Edge.  (a) This plot shows ‘Hot’ Hα intensity as a function of position and power and is 

qualitatively  consistent  with  findings  along  any  longitudinal  cell  axis.    That  is,  the 

relative intensity is highest between the plates and nearly symmetric for power of 100 W 

or less, and asymmetric with the highest intensity at the gas input end for power of 150 W 

or more.  (b) Along any longitudinal GEC axis very little change in the magnitude of line 

broadening as a function of position is found. Also notable: the kinetic temperature of the 

hot H atoms is higher at an input of 100 W than for an input of 150 W.  

Figure 4.  Balmer Hβ Line Broadening. All Balmer series lines studied. (e.g. Hα, Hβ, Hγ, 

Hδ at position (3)) were broadened (see Table I).

Figure 5.  Fitting of Hα Peaks Using two Gausian Profiles. The sample spectrum shown 

was  taken  for  a  H2/He  ratio  of  1  x  10-5  at  Position  -15,3.    This  figure  is  very 

representative of the fitting process employed in all cases. 

Figure  6.    Voltage  Measured  Between  Electrodes.    This  data  shows  that  there  is  a 

significant change in voltage between the electrodes as a function of power absorbed by 

the plasma.

Abstract 

The article discusses the steady motion of a rigid disk of finite thickness rolling on its 

edge on a horizontal plane under the influence of gravity. The governing equations are 

presented and two cases allowing for a steady state solution are considered: rolling on 

consistently  rough  ground  and  rolling  on  perfectly  smooth  ground.  The  conditions  of 

steady  motion  are  derived  for  both  kinds  of  ground  and  it  is  shown  that  the  possible 

steady  motion  of  a  disk  is  either  on  a  straight  line  in  a  circle.  Also  oscillations  about 

steady state are discussed and conditions for stable motion are established. 

Key words: Dynamics, Steady motion, Stability 

1  Introduction 

The problem of an infinitely thin rolling disk or a hoop is the classical example of non-

holonomic constrained motion of a rigid body and has a long history. By its nature the 

problem is a special case of the motion of a rigid body of revolution on the plane for 

which the equation of motion was already known in the second half of the 19 century 

([14]). The problem of integrating the equation of motion of a disk on rough ground was 

solved by P.Appel and D.Korteweg in 1900 (see [1],[7],[18]) when they showed that the 

first  integrals  of  equations  of  motion  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  Gauss 

hypergeometric  functions.  Later,  in  1903,  E.Gallop  noted  that  the  solution  of  the 

problem of a rolling disk leads to Legendere's equation. This solution can be found in

Routh’s  book  ([15])  in  which  steady  state  motion  is  also  considered  and  the  formulas 

for the condition for steady state motion, the period of small oscillations about steady 

motion  and  the  condition  for  stability  of  steady  motion  for  the  case  of  straight  line 

rolling, spinning about a diameter and rolling in a circle are given. These formulas was 

later  derived  by  various  authors  ([7],[8],[11],[12],[16],[17]).  Their  derivation  differs 

from  the  principle  from  which  equations  of  motion  were  derived,  either  from  Euler 

equations  or  from  Lagrange  equations,  and  the  orientation  of  intermediate  coordinate 

systems  used.  The  study  of  stability  of  motion  of  a  thin  disk  on  smooth  ground  was 

made for example by Milne ([9]) and recently by McDonald ([8]). 

At the end of the last century the interest in the study of the motion of a disk increased.  

O'Reilly ([13]) made a complete study of bifurcations and stability of steady motion of  

a  thin  disk  on  rough  and  smooth  ground  based  on  two  integration  parameters  of  an 

analytical  solution  of  equations  of  motion  where,  for  the  case  of  rough  ground,  the 

solution was given in terms of Legendere functions. Similar results were later given by 

Kuleshev ([4],[5]), who studied the rolling of a thin disk on rough ground and provided 

results  in  terms  of  Gauss  hypergeometric  functions.  The  solution  of  the  problem  in 

terms  of  these  functions  was  also  given  in  the  paper  of  Borisov  et  al  [2]  where  the 

bifurcation  diagrams  based  on  integration  parameters  were  constructed  and  qualitative 

analysis of the point of contact of a disk on a plane was given.  

Among papers, motivated by the paper of Moffatt ([10]) who considered the settling of 

a  science  toy  called  ‘Euler's  disk’,  of  particular  interest  to  this  paper  is  a  study  by 

Kessler  and  O'Reilly  ([3]),  for  the  authors  discuss  a  disk  of  finite  thickness;  they 

introduce  the  resistance  moment  into  equations  of  motion  and  perform  numerical 

simulations of the so-called stick-slip movement of a disk. Recently LeSaux et al ([6]) 

published  the  extensive  numerical  and  analytical  study  of  a  thin  disk  rolling  under 

various kinds of friction models. 

The  above  review  of  the  literature  indicates  that  the  motion  of  a  thin  disk  has  been, 

analytically  and  numerically,  exhaustively  studied.  For  a  disk  with  finite  thickness,  as 

was  noted  by  Routh  ([15]),  the  equation  of  motion  can  be  derived  from  the  general 

equation of motion of the body of revolution by putting the radius of curvature at zero. 

This was done by Webster ([18]). But apparently, beside the Kessler and O'Reilly ([3]) 

numerical simulations of the motion of a disk, no study of steady motion was done. The 

purpose of this paper is to fill this gap.

2 Equations 

Consider a rigid homogeneous disk moving on a horizontal plane in the homogeneous 

gravity field. The disk radius is a, height 2 .  Note that for a greater h the disk becomes 

h

a cylinder and eventually a bar; but the term disk will be used for all cases. 

To  describe  disk  motion  three  coordinate  systems  are  used  (Figure  1)  ([3],[13]):  the 

inertial  coordinate  system 

OXZY

  and  the  intermediate  coordinate  systems  C

xzy   and 

Cξηζ  with origins in the disk centre of mass point C. The system   Cxzy  is with respect 

to 

OXZY

  rotated  about  the 

Z

-axis

  at  spin  angle 

ψ  and  the  system  Cξηζ   is  with 

respect  to  Cxzy   rotated  about  the 

x

-axis

  at  inclination  angle

θ.  The  body  frame  of 

reference (which is not used) is rotated about 

-axisη

 at rotation angleϕ.

There  are  three  kinds  of  possible  contact  of  the  disk  with  the  plane  ([3]).  When 

θ π= ±

2

  the  disk  lies  on  the  plane  (surface  contact)  and  this  case  is  excluded  from 

further discussion. When  

0h >

 and 

0θ=  the disk contact with the plane is a line on 

the  disk-bounding  surface.  There  are  two  simple  motions  of  the  disk  in  this  position: 

pure rolling and pure spinning about a diameter. In all other cases when the disk reaches 

0θ=   this  is  accompanied  by  impact  and  a  bouncing  motion  can  result.  These 

phenomena require additional study, so case 

0θ=  will only be used for

0h =

. For all 

other  angles

θ,  the  disk  is  inclined  to  vertical  and  the  contact  is  point  P  on  the  edge 

between the disk surface and its bounding planes (Figure 2).

3 Steady State Solutions

which could be (at least numerically) integrated when the initial conditions are specified 

and  the  additional  five  constitutive  equations  for  calculation  of  friction  force 

tF   and 

contact  moment  M,  which  fulfils  inequalities  (14),  are  given.  However,  in  the  case  of 

steady motion, which is the interest of this paper, the energy should be constant. Thus 

from (12) and (14) the steady motion is possible only if 

v F
⋅
P
t

=

0

 and

=Mω

⋅

0

. The 

first is true in two cases:  

8

(cid:131)  on perfectly rough ground where slip velocity is zero; i.e.,  P 0

P 0

=  and  

0

(cid:131)  on perfectly smooth ground when friction force is zero; i.e.,  

F

F=
y

=

. 0

The second is true if  

=M 0

 or

= 0ω

. In what follows only the first is taken to be true 

since the second implies that the disk is at rest if the ground is perfectly rough or in a 

state  of  inertial  motion  if  the  ground  is  perfectly  smooth.  In  what  follows  the  term 

perfect will be omitted when referring to the ground type. 

Besides  energy,  all  unknowns  entered  into  the  energy  equation  should  be  constants  in 

steady  motion  as  well.  According  to  (13)  these  unknowns  are  components  of  the 

velocity  of  point  C,  components  of  the  angular  velocity  of  the  disk  and,  at 

CZ ,  the 

inclination angle. Let 

0θ θ=

 be the steady state value of the inclination angle. Then by 

(2)2  

0ω =  and further by (7)2  C

Depending on condition (20)1 kinematical equations (1) have two possible solutions. It 

will be shown that when 

0Ω =

 a disk rolls on a straight line or stands still, and when 

0Ω ≠
0

 the disk rolls in a circle.

 are the initial position of point C. The solution shows that if

 then the disk rolls on a straight line and if 

v

v=

C 0

Further, it follows from (19)2 that 

yF =  and since also 

0

xF =  there is no friction force 

0

in the straight line steady motion even in the case of rough ground.  

Because  when 

0Ω =
0

  then  also 

0ω =   and  the  condition  (20)2  is  reduced  to

30

y =
P0

0

. 

From  (17),  it  follows  that

X

C

P

;  i.e.,  the  coordinates  of  instantaneous 

contact  point  P  coincide  with  those  of  point  C  as  expected.  Also,  from  (16)1,  one  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where

0   showing  that  in  straight  line  steady  motion  the  disk  is  at  the  SE  position 

tan

hθ = (cid:4)

(Figure 3b).  

In  the  case  when  a  disk  is  rolling  on  a  straight  line  on  rough  ground  one  has 

v

v=

C 0

=

  and

xv

P 0

=

,  which,  from  (18)1,  yields

xv ω=

C 0

0

.  Thus  on  rough  ground 

the only arbitrary parameter influencing the motion is

0ω . On smooth ground

C 0xv

, 

C 0yv

 

and 

20ω  are arbitrary and from (18) the components of velocity of point P are given by

into the form 

 

 

 

The  sign 

Cr

  depends  on  the  signs  of  velocities 

C 0xv

  and 

0Ω   while  the  direction  of 

rolling in a circle depends also on sign 

0Ω .  However, as can be shown from (22) by 

transforming  coordinate  system 

OXZY

  to  point  A  and  rotating  it  to  angle

0ψ ,  that  for 

fixed  centre  point  A,  the  disk  rolls  counter  clockwise  if 

0Ω >   and  clockwise  if 

0

0Ω <
0

,  whatever  sign 

  is.  The  sign ,  according  to  (25),  only  affects  the  initial 

Cr

Cr

position  of  point  C.  From  this  the  relation  of  signs 

  and  inclination  angle 

Cr

0θ   is  as 

follows: if 

Cr

 and 

0θ  has the same sign then the disk diameter is leaning towards point 

A; otherwise it leans outward.  In other words, negative inclination 

0θ  can be replaced 

by negative

Cr

. This justifies consideration of  

0θ  only at interval

Two  can  be  chosen  arbitrarily;  the  other  two  are  then  determinate.    When 

0θ Ω   are 

0,

given, 

0ω  can be calculated from (29) and then 

Cr

 and 

Pr

 can be calculated from(26). If  

P, rθ  or 

0

0 C, rθ  are given then the situation is a bit complicated since two cases must be 

distinguished: the case 

tan

 and the case

tan

hθ = (cid:4)

0

hθ ≠ (cid:4) . 

0

First, if 

0 C, rθ  are given and 

0

tan

hθ = (cid:4)  meaning that the disk is in the SE position, then 

by (16)1 also 

y =
P

0

 and so, from (26), 

Cr

rP= . Now, since in circular motion

0Ω ≠

 then, as can be seen from (30), when

 then 

r >

, indicating 

that the disk is leaning toward point A and when 

h >

 then 

r >

 so the disk leans 

outward. The radius 

 is in both cases limited. When

When

--i.e.,  points  C  and  P  are  at  rest--the  disk  spins  in  place  with 

0Ω

  and 

according  to  (26), 

0ω = .  From  (30)  this  can  be  achieved  when 

0h =

3ω(cid:4)   are  small  perturbations  of  corresponding  variables  in  the 

stationary state. Unlike the steady motion solution the case of rough ground and smooth 

ground must be considered separately. 

4.1 Rough Ground 

On  rough  ground  the  instantaneous  contact  point  P  is  at  rest;  i.e., 

v

v

y

=

v
P
z

=

. 

Using this, the velocity components

  are  obtained  in  terms  of  inclination  angle 

θ  and  components  of  angular 

velocities

Conclusion 

 

The  article  provides  a  complete  study  of  steady  motion  and  the  stability  of  steady 

motion for a disk of finite thickness on rough and smooth surfaces. It was shown that 

the derived formulas for the condition of steady motion and stability of such a motion in 

limit  cases    agrees  with  those  known  for  an  infinitely  thin  disk.  In  addition,  it  was 

 

27

shown  that  steady  motion  is  stable  for  any   

0h >

  and 

0

  if  in  the  case  of
